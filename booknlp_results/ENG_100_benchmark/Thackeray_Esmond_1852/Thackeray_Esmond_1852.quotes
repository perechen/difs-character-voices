1839	1846	1847	1847	she	1360	" And this is our kinsman , "
1849	1858	1847	1847	she	1360	" and what is your name , kinsman ? "
1859	1866	1868	1869	the lad	1365	" My name is Henry Esmond , "
1948	1961	1963	1964	Mrs. Worksop	460	" His name is Henry Esmond , sure enough , my lady , "
2446	2453	2455	2456	my lord	1352	" So this is the little priest "
2464	2469	2455	2456	my lord	1352	" welcome , kinsman . "
2470	2479	2481	2483	the little girl	1401	" He is saying his prayers to mamma , "
2548	2558	2560	2561	the lady	1381	" Le pauvre enfant , il n'a que nous , "
2593	2603	2614	2614	he	1352	" And he sha n't want for friends here , "
2619	2984	2614	2614	he	1352	" The little girl , whose name was Beatrix , and whom her papa called by this diminutive , looked at Henry Esmond solemnly , with a pair of large eyes , and then a smile shone over her face , which was as beautiful as that of a cherub , and she came up and put out a little hand to him . A keen and delightful pang of gratitude , happiness , affection , filled the orphan child 's heart , as he received from the protectors , whom heaven had sent to him , these touching words and tokens of friendliness and kindness . But an hour since , he had felt quite alone in the world : when he heard the great peal of bells from Castlewood church ringing that morning to welcome the arrival of the new lord and lady , it had rung only terror and anxiety to him , for he knew not how the new owner would deal with him ; and those to whom he formerly looked for protection were forgotten or dead . Pride and doubt too had kept him within - doors , when the Vicar and the people of the village , and the servants of the house , had gone out to welcome my Lord Castlewood for Henry Esmond was no servant , though a dependant ; no relative , though he bore the name and inherited the blood of the house ; and in the midst of the noise and acclamations attending the arrival of the new lord for whom , you may be sure , a feast was got ready , and guns were fired , and tenants and domestics huzzahed when his carriage approached and rolled into the court - yard of the hall , no one ever took any notice of young Henry Esmond , who sat unobserved and alone in the Book - room , until the afternoon of that day , when his new friends found him . When my lord and lady were going away thence , the little girl , still holding her kinsman by the hand , bade him to come too . "
2999	3133	2997	2997	Trix	461	" says her father to her good - naturedly ; and went into the gallery , giving an arm to his lady . They passed thence through the music - gallery , long since dismantled , and Queen Elizabeth 's Rooms , in the clock - tower , and out into the terrace , where was a fine prospect of sunset and the great darkling woods with a cloud of rooks returning ; and the plain and river with Castlewood village beyond , and purple hills beautiful to look at and the little heir of Castlewood , a child of two years old , was already here on the terrace in his nurse 's arms , from whom he ran across the grass instantly he perceived his mother , and came to her . "
3142	3153	3154	3154	thou	1410	" says my lord , looking round at the scene , "
3162	3163	3160	3160	Rachel	464	" "
3171	3175	3164	3164	I	0	" she said , "
3186	3262	3263	3263	I	0	" Then my lord began to describe what was before them to his wife , and what indeed little Harry knew better than he viz . , the history of the house : how by yonder gate the page ran away with the heiress of Castlewood , by which the estate came into the present family ; how the Roundheads attacked the clock - tower , which my lord 's father was slain in defending . "
3271	3275	3263	3263	I	0	" says he , "
3294	3295	3291	3292	kinsman Harry	427	" "
3298	3307	3291	3292	kinsman Harry	427	" says his wife , with a laugh . "
3318	3347	3316	3316	Rachel	464	" answers my lord , looking fondly down at her . Indeed she seemed to be a girl , and was at that time scarce twenty years old . "
3361	3365	3353	3353	I	0	" says she , "
3377	3378	3379	3379	You	427	" "
3395	3511	3390	3390	papa	1414	" says Miss Beatrix , with a toss of her little head ; at which the mother smiled , and the good - natured father laughed , and the little trotting boy laughed , not knowing why but because he was happy , no doubt as every one seemed to be there . How those trivial incidents and words , the landscape and sunshine , and the group of people smiling and talking , remain fixed on the memory ! As the sun was setting , the little heir was sent in the arms of his nurse to bed , whither he went howling ; but little Trix was promised to sit to supper that night "
3524	3532	3533	3533	I	0	" she said . Harry Esmond blushed : "
3541	3545	3538	3539	Mrs. Worksop	460	" says he . "
3550	3555	3538	3539	Mrs. Worksop	460	" says my lord , "
3579	3639	3575	3575	he	427	" and they all wondered at Harry 's performance as a trencher - man , in which character the poor boy acquitted himself very remarkably ; for the truth is he had had no dinner , nobody thinking of him in the bustle which the house was in , during the preparations antecedent to the new lord 's arrival . "
3647	3681	3682	3683	The King	1293	" says my lady , heaping up his plate with meat , and my lord , filling a bumper for him , bade him call a health ; on which Master Harry , crying "
3685	3967	3969	3969	you	1423	" tossed off the wine . My lord was ready to drink that , and most other toasts : indeed only too ready . He would not hear of Doctor Tusher the Vicar of Castlewood , who came to supper going away when the sweetmeats were brought : he had not had a chaplain long enough , he said , to be tired of him : so his reverence kept my lord company for some hours over a pipe and a punch - bowl ; and went away home with rather a reeling gait , and declaring a dozen of times , that his lordship 's affability surpassed every kindness he had ever had from his lordship 's gracious family . As for young Esmond , when he got to his little chamber , it was with a heart full of surprise and gratitude towards the new friends whom this happy day had brought him . He was up and watching long before the house was astir , longing to see that fair lady and her children that kind protector and patron : and only fearful lest their welcome of the past night should in any way be withdrawn or altered . But presently little Beatrix came out into the garden , and her mother followed , who greeted Harry as kindly as before . He told her at greater length the histories of the house which he had been taught in the old lord 's time , and to which she listened with great interest ; and then he told her , with respect to the night before , that he understood French , and thanked her for her protection . "
3971	3979	3982	3982	sir	1424	" says she , with a blush ; "
3991	4025	3984	3984	you	1423	" And she asked him many more questions regarding himself , which had best be told more fully and explicitly than in those brief replies which the lad made to his mistress 's questions .
5231	5252	5222	5223	Frank Esmond	475	" Jack , your sister may be so - and - so , but by Jove my wife sha n't ! "
6798	6802	6804	6805	my lady	11267	" I never , "
6807	6844	6804	6805	my lady	11267	" could have come to see his Majesty 's posset carried by any other hand than an Esmond . I should have dashed the salver out of Lord Bergamot 's hand , had I met him . "

7496	7512	7493	7493	Sark	497	" Tom Esmond , her husband , would run away with them and pawn them . "
7953	7964	7943	7943	he	503	" Angel ! she belongs to the Babylonish scarlet woman . "
8759	8764	8765	8765	he	1807	" C'est bien ca , "
8784	8794	8765	8765	he	1807	" Let Blaise take him out for a holiday , "
9236	9253	9255	9257	my Lord Viscount	1859	" You must never sing that song any more : do you hear , little mannikin ? "
9264	9277	9255	9257	my Lord Viscount	1859	" But we will try and teach you a better , Harry , "
9300	9319	9288	9288	he	1607	" That he loved pretty songs , and would try and learn anything the gentleman would tell him . "
9369	9378	9380	9380	Blaise	508	" ' Tis well , ' tis well ! "
9396	9428	9385	9385	his	508	" We are a little lord here ; we are a little lord now : we shall see what we are when we come to Castlewood , where my lady is . "
9429	9440	9442	9442	Harry	427	" When shall we come to Castlewood , Monsieur Blaise ? "
9444	9454	9455	9455	Blaise	508	" Parbleu ! my lord does not press himself , "
9654	9663	9665	9666	Mr. Holt	511	" This , Harry , is Castlewood church , "
9668	9692	9665	9666	Mr. Holt	511	" and this is the pillar thereof , learned Doctor Tusher . Take off your hat , sirrah , and salute Dr. Tusher ! "
9693	9701	9703	9704	my lord	1352	" Come up to supper , Doctor , "
9873	9886	9869	9870	the Frenchman	1838	" Parbleu , one sees well that my lord is your godfather ; "
10453	10471	10472	10473	Mr. Holt	511	" I present to your ladyship your kinsman and little page of honor , Master Henry Esmond , "
10486	10516	10472	10473	Mr. Holt	511	" Make a pretty bow to my lady , Monsieur ; and then another little bow , not so low , to Madame Tusher the fair priestess of Castlewood . "
10517	10529	10531	10532	Madame Tusher	516	" Where I have lived and hope to die , sir , "
10585	10595	10597	10598	the lady	1381	" Does my appearance please you , little page ? "
10600	10613	10615	10616	Madame Tusher	516	" He would be very hard to please if it did n't , "
10618	10626	10628	10629	Lady Castlewood	494	" Have done , you silly Maria , "
10631	10652	10628	10629	Lady Castlewood	494	" Where I 'm attached , I 'm attached , Madame and I 'd die rather than not say so . "
10653	10660	10661	10662	Mr. Holt	511	" Je meurs ou je m'attache , "
10669	10691	10661	10662	Mr. Holt	511	" The ivy says so in the picture , and clings to the oak like a fond parasite as it is . "
10692	10697	10699	10700	Mrs. Tusher	515	" Parricide , sir ! "
10702	10714	10699	10700	Mrs. Tusher	515	" Hush , Tusher you are always bickering with Father Holt , "
10719	10728	10716	10717	my lady	11267	" Come and kiss my hand , child ; "
10763	10776	10778	10779	Mrs. Tusher	515	" To kiss that hand would make many a pretty fellow happy ! "
10788	10795	10798	10798	her	11267	" Go , you foolish Tusher ! "
10885	10951	10882	10882	she	1934	" Page Esmond , my groom of the chamber will inform you what your duties are , when you wait upon my lord and me ; and good Father Holt will instruct you as becomes a gentleman of our name . You will pay him obedience in everything , and I pray you may grow to be as learned and as good as your tutor . "
11079	11086	11087	11087	he	511	" Who is that other woman ? "
11090	11106	11087	11087	he	511	" She is fat and round ; she is more pretty than my Lady Castlewood . "
11107	11133	11054	11055	the Father	1897	" She is Madame Tusher , the parson 's wife of Castlewood . She has a son of your age , but bigger than you . "
11134	11154	11054	11055	the Father	1897	" Why does she like so to kiss my lady 's hand . It is not good to kiss . "
11155	11207	11087	11087	he	511	" Tastes are different , little man . Madame Tusher is attached to my lady , having been her waiting - woman before she was married , in the old lord 's time . She married Doctor Tusher the chaplain . The English household divines often marry the waiting - women . "
11208	11230	11054	11055	the Father	1897	" You will not marry the French woman , will you ? I saw her laughing with Blaise in the buttery . "
11231	11247	11248	11249	Mr. Holt	511	" I belong to a church that is older and better than the English church , "
11269	11287	11248	11249	Mr. Holt	511	" in our church the clergy do not marry . You will understand these things better soon . "
11288	11307	11308	11309	The Father	1897	" Was not Saint Peter the head of your church ? Dr. Rabbits of Ealing told us so . "
11312	11318	11308	11309	The Father	1897	" Yes , he was . "
11319	11343	11248	11249	Mr. Holt	511	" But Saint Peter was married , for we heard only last Sunday that his wife 's mother lay sick of a fever . "
11487	11490	11520	11521	Harry Esmond	427	" Three Castles "
12662	12804	12647	12649	young Harry Esmond	427	" Church ! priesthood ! fat living ! My dear Tommy , do you call yours a church and a priesthood ? What is a fat living compared to converting a hundred thousand heathens by a single sermon ? What is a scholarship at Trinity by the side of a crown of martyrdom , with angels awaiting you as your head is taken off ? Could your master at school sail over the Thames on his gown ? Have you statues in your church that can bleed , speak , walk , and cry ? My good Tommy , in dear Father Holt 's church these things take place every day . You know Saint Philip of the Willows appeared to Lord Castlewood , and caused him to turn to the one true church . No saints ever come to you . "

' ' No , sire , ' I replied , ' I would not kneel to a Usurper ; the Esmond that would have served your Majesty will never be groom to a traitor 's posset . ' The royal exile smiled , even in the midst of his misfortune ; he deigned to raise me with words of consolation .

20689	20713	20684	20684	he	1352	" we are four to two ; will you be so kind as to take that road , and leave me go mine ? "
20714	20723	20725	20726	the officer	2516	" Your road is mine , my lord , "
20728	20730	20732	20733	my lord	1352	" Then "
20812	20817	20820	20821	Father Holt	509	" Fire ! fire ! "
20859	20868	20870	20870	Blaise	508	" Mr. Holt , qui pensait a tout , "
20872	20926	20870	20870	Blaise	508	" gets off his horse , examines the pockets of the dead officer for papers , gives his money to us two , and says , ' The wine is drawn , M. le Marquis , ' why did he say Marquis to M. le Vicomte ? ' we must drink it . ' "
20941	20945	20946	20947	Mr. Holt	511	" Blaise continues ; "

21099	21118	21097	21097	me	0	" And he gave Harry the two papers . He read that to himself , which only said , "
21135	21430	21129	21129	You	508	" Harry read this , ran up stairs to his mistress 's apartment , where her gentlewoman slept near to the door , made her bring a light and wake my lady , into whose hands he gave the paper . She was a wonderful object to look at in her night attire , nor had Harry ever seen the like . As soon as she had the paper in her hand , Harry stepped back to the Chaplain 's room , opened the secret cupboard over the fireplace , burned all the papers in it , and , as he had seen the priest do before , took down one of his reverence 's manuscript sermons , and half burnt that in the brazier . By the time the papers were quite destroyed it was daylight . Harry ran back to his mistress again . Her gentlewoman ushered him again into her ladyship 's chamber ; she told him from behind her nuptial curtains to bid the coach be got ready , and that she would ride away anon . But the mysteries of her ladyship 's toilet were as awfully long on this day as on any other , and , long after the coach was ready , my lady was still attiring herself . And just as the Viscountess stepped forth from her room , ready for departure , young John Lockwood comes running up from the village with news that a lawyer , three officers , and twenty or four - and - twenty soldiers , were marching thence upon the house . John had but two minutes the start of them , and , ere he had well told his story , the troop rode into our court - yard .

21779	21788	21790	21794	the good - natured Captain	2594	" Rheumatism ! that 's a sad complaint , "

Your ladyship will please give me your keys , and it will be as well for yourself that you should help us , in every way , in our search . "

But he says no : he considers Mr. Freeman the head of the firm , will never trade against him or embark with any other trading company , but considers his duty was done when Mr. Freeman left England . This Colonel seems to care more for his wife and his beagles than for affairs . He asked me much about young H. E. , ' that bastard , ' as he called him ; doubting my lord 's intentions respecting him . I reassured him on this head , stating what I knew of the lad , and our intentions respecting him , but with regard to Freeman he was inflexible . "

24029	24038	24040	24041	Captain Westbury	546	" Egad ! it 's Greek to me , "
24043	24052	24040	24041	Captain Westbury	546	" Can you read it , little boy ? "
24053	24061	24062	24062	Harry	427	" Yes , sir , a little , "
24065	24080	24082	24083	the lawyer	2585	" Then read , and read in English , sir , on your peril , "
24091	24168	24086	24086	Harry	427	" Hath not one of your own writers said , ' The children of Adam are now laboring as much as he himself ever did , about the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , shaking the boughs thereof , and seeking the fruit , being for the most part unmindful of the tree of life .

24375	24383	24385	24386	the lawyer	2585	" I did n't know , sir , "
24388	24405	24407	24408	the trooper	2546	" How should you ? I take it you are not accustomed to meet with gentlemen , "
24410	24422	24424	24424	Westbury	546	" Hold thy prate , and read that bit of paper , "

24445	24455	24457	24457	he	558	" and from a sermon of Mr. Cudworth 's , "
24470	24478	24480	24481	the Captain	2533	" What a young scholar you are , "
24486	24497	24499	24500	the lawyer	2585	" Depend on't , he knows more than he tells , "
24502	24517	24499	24500	the lawyer	2585	" I think we will pack him off in the coach with old Jezebel . "
24518	24526	24528	24529	the Captain	2533	" For construing a bit of Latin ? "
24536	24546	24528	24529	the Captain	2533	" I would as lief go there as anywhere , "
24553	24563	24547	24548	Harry Esmond	427	" for there is nobody to care for me . "
24620	24626	24628	24629	the lawyer	2585	" What does he say ? "
24631	24638	24640	24641	Captain Westbury	546	" Faith , ask Dick himself , "
24643	24672	24674	24675	the trooper	2546	" I said I was not ignorant of misfortune myself , and had learned to succor the miserable , and that 's not YOUR trade , Mr. Sheepskin , "

25326	25333	25334	25334	Dick	563	" I am no common soldier , "
25360	25409	25514	25520	a number of saints of the Church	2748	" I am of one of the most ancient families in the empire ; I have had my education at a famous school , and a famous university ; I learned my first rudiments of Latin near to Smithfield , in London , where the martyrs were roasted . "
25410	25418	25420	25420	Harry	427	" You hanged as many of ours , "
25422	25473	25420	25420	Harry	427	" and , for the matter of persecution , Father Holt told me that a young gentleman of Edinburgh , eighteen years of age , student at the college there , was hanged for heresy only last year , though he recanted , and solemnly asked pardon for his errors . "
25474	25494	25514	25520	a number of saints of the Church	2748	" Faith ! there has been too much persecution on both sides : but ' twas you taught us . "
25495	25505	25507	25508	the lad	1365	" Nay , ' twas the Pagans began it , "
25528	25578	25514	25520	a number of saints of the Church	2748	" this one 's fire went out under him : that one 's oil cooled in the caldron : at a third holy head the executioner chopped three times and it would not come off . Show us martyrs in YOUR church for whom such miracles have been done . "
25579	25582	25584	25585	the trooper	2546	" Nay , "
25588	25608	25584	25585	the trooper	2546	" the miracles of the first three centuries belong to my Church as well as yours , Master Papist , "
25628	25858	25859	25859	he	2752	" And yet , my little catechiser , I have sometimes thought about those miracles , that there was not much good in them , since the victim 's head always finished by coming off at the third or fourth chop , and the caldron , if it did not boil one day , boiled the next . Howbeit , in our times , the Church has lost that questionable advantage of respites . There never was a shower to put out Ridley 's fire , nor an angel to turn the edge of Campion 's axe . The rack tore the limbs of Southwell the Jesuit and Sympson the Protestant alike . For faith , everywhere multitudes die willingly enough . I have read in Monsieur Rycaut 's ' History of the Turks , ' of thousands of Mahomet 's followers rushing upon death in battle as upon certain Paradise ; and in the great Mogul 's dominions people fling themselves by hundreds under the cars of the idols annually , and the widows burn themselves on their husbands ' bodies , as ' tis well known . ' Tis not the dying for a faith that 's so hard , Master Harry every man of every nation has done that ' tis the living up to it that is difficult , as I know to my cost , "
25865	25869	25870	25870	he	2752	" And ah ! "
25873	25975	25976	25976	Dick	563	" my poor lad , I am not strong enough to convince thee by my life though to die for my religion would give me the greatest of joys but I had a dear friend in Magdalen College in Oxford ; I wish Joe Addison were here to convince thee , as he quickly could for I think he 's a match for the whole College of Jesuits ; and what 's more , in his life too . In that very sermon of Dr. Cudworth 's which your priest was quoting from , and which suffered martydom in the brazier , "
25982	26056	25976	25976	Dick	563	" I had a thought of wearing the black coat but was ashamed of my life , you see , and took to this sorry red one ; I have often thought of Joe Addison Dr. Cudworth says , ' A good conscience is the best looking - glass of heaven ' and there 's serenity in my friend 's face which always reflects it I wish you could see him , Harry . "
26057	26068	26070	26071	the lad	1365	" Did he do you a great deal of good ? "
26075	26081	26083	26084	the other	1781	" He might have done , "
26085	26107	26083	26084	the other	1781	" at least he taught me to see and approve better things . ' Tis my own fault , deteriora sequi . "
26108	26114	26115	26116	the boy	1347	" You seem very good , "
26119	26129	26131	26132	the trooper	2546	" I 'm not what I seem , alas ! "
26268	26281	26259	26259	Harry	427	" Ah , little Papist , I wish Joseph Addison was here ! "
27455	27463	27465	27466	Captain Westbury	546	" Here 's news for Frank Esmond , "
27468	27478	27465	27466	Captain Westbury	546	" Harry , did you ever see Colonel Esmond ? "
27511	27518	27494	27494	he	427	" And did he say anything ? "
27519	27530	27531	27531	Harry	427	" He said what I do n't care to repeat , "
27577	27585	27562	27575	the man who had most likely stained his mother 's honor and his own	2861	" Did you love my Lord Castlewood ? "
27586	27600	27601	27602	the boy	1347	" I wait until I know my mother , sir , to say , "
27611	27619	27620	27621	Captain Westbury	546	" Something has happened to Lord Castlewood , "
27653	27654	27655	27655	I	0	" "
27666	27671	27655	27655	I	0	" the boy said . "
27699	27704	27705	27705	I	0	" continued Mr. Westbury . "
27742	28115	27734	27734	he	2861	" Harry did not know , he said . He was in the hands of Heaven and Fate ; but more lonely now , as it seemed to him , than he had been all the rest of his life ; and that night , as he lay in his little room which he still occupied , the boy thought with many a pang of shame and grief of his strange and solitary condition : how he had a father and no father ; a nameless mother that had been brought to ruin , perhaps , by that very father whom Harry could only acknowledge in secret and with a blush , and whom he could neither love nor revere . And he sickened to think how Father Holt , a stranger , and two or three soldiers , his acquaintances of the last six weeks , were the only friends he had in the great wide world , where he was now quite alone . The soul of the boy was full of love , and he longed as he lay in the darkness there for some one upon whom he could bestow it . He remembers , and must to his dying day , the thoughts and tears of that long night , the hours tolling through it . Who was he , and what ? Why here rather than elsewhere ? I have a mind , he thought , to go to that priest at Trim , and find out what my father said to him on his death - bed confession . Is there any child in the whole world so unprotected as I am ? Shall I get up and quit this place , and run to Ireland ? With these thoughts and tears the lad passed that night away until he wept himself to sleep . The next day , the gentlemen of the guard , who had heard what had befallen him , were more than usually kind to the child , especially his friend Scholar Dick , who told him about his own father 's death , which had happened when Dick was a child at Dublin , not quite five years of age . "
28124	28128	28129	28129	I	0	" Dick said , "
28227	28232	28206	28206	they	2876	" said Dick kindly , "
28273	28370	28270	28271	Richard Steele	577	" Harry Esmond thanked him , and was grateful . But what could Corporal Steele do for him ? take him to ride a spare horse , and be servant to the troop ? Though there might be a bar in Harry Esmond 's shield , it was a noble one . The counsel of the two friends was , that little Harry should stay where he was , and abide his fortune : so Esmond stayed on at Castlewood , awaiting with no small anxiety the fate , whatever it was , which was over him .

33295	33429	33292	33293	the Doctor	1628	" ' Tis true they are a comfort and a help to him when attainable , and to be administered with hope of good . But in a case where the life of a parish priest in the midst of his flock is highly valuable to them , he is not called upon to risk it and therewith the lives , future prospects , and temporal , even spiritual welfare of his own family for the sake of a single person , who is not very likely in a condition even to understand the religious message whereof the priest is the bringer being uneducated , and likewise stupefied or delirious by disease . If your ladyship or his lordship , my excellent good friend and patron , were to take it . . . "

He may have killed Frank for what I know killed our child . Why was he brought in to disgrace our house ? Why is he here ? Let him go let him go , I say , to - night , and pollute the place no more .

35488	35505	35507	35508	my lord	1352	" You would n't take a wife out of Castlewood now , would you , Doctor ? "
35531	35582	35513	35514	The Doctor	1628	" But joking apart , and , my lord , as a divine , I can not treat the subject in a jocular light , nor , as a pastor of this congregation , look with anything but sorrow at the idea of so very young a sheep going astray . "

35677	35682	35661	35661	She	3225	" cried out Henry , "

35711	35716	35695	35695	you	1628	" cried the Doctor . "
35808	35841	35791	35791	you	1628	" The Doctor raised his voice as he spoke , and looked towards my lady , who had now come back , looking very pale , with a handkerchief in her hand . "
35850	35861	35791	35791	you	1628	" said Lady Esmond , looking at the young man . "
35877	35878	35868	35868	he	1933	" "
35886	35891	35868	35868	he	1933	" said my lady . "
35905	35913	35899	35899	I	0	" cried my lord , stepping back . "
35936	35957	35958	35958	I	0	" My lady looked at him with some surprise , and instantly advancing to Henry Esmond , took his hand . "
35965	35969	35970	35970	I	0	" she said ; "
35985	35994	35984	35984	your	1607	" My lord broke out into an oath . "
36006	36025	36003	36004	my lady	11267	" She looked a little red , and faintly pressed the lad 's hand as she dropped it . "
36034	36038	36039	36039	Frank	597	" she said ; "
36067	36068	36073	36073	damme	3240	" "
36075	36080	36073	36073	damme	3240	" cried my lord . "
36086	36096	36081	36081	I	0	" and he lighted his pipe again with a coal "
36133	36134	36135	36135	I	0	" "
36140	36145	36135	36135	I	0	" said my lady ; "
36192	36193	36194	36194	I	0	" "
36201	36206	36194	36194	I	0	" said my lord ; "

36268	36381	36259	36259	You	0	" said my lord , at which her ladyship hung down her head and looked foolish : and my lord , calling away Tusher , bade him come to the oak parlor and have a pipe . The Doctor made a low bow to her ladyship of which salaams he was profuse , and walked off on his creaking square - toes after his patron . When the lady and the young man were alone , there was a silence of some moments , during which he stood at the fire , looking rather vacantly at the dying embers , whilst her ladyship busied herself with the tambour - frame and needles . "
36386	36401	36402	36402	I	0	" she said , after a pause , in a hard , dry voice , "
36615	36828	36612	36613	Mr. Esmond	427	" And with this she dropped a stately curtsy , and , taking her candle , went away through the tapestry door , which led to her apartments . Esmond stood by the fireplace , blankly staring after her . Indeed , he scarce seemed to see until she was gone ; and then her image was impressed upon him , and remained for ever fixed upon his memory . He saw her retreating , the taper lighting up her marble face , her scarlet lip quivering , and her shining golden hair . He went to his own room , and to bed , where he tried to read , as his custom was ; but he never knew what he was reading until afterwards he remembered the appearance of the letters of the book it was in Montaigne 's Essays , and the events of the day passed before him that is , of the last hour of the day ; for as for the morning , and the poor milkmaid yonder , he never so much as once thought . And he could not get to sleep until daylight , and woke with a violent headache , and quite unrefreshed . He had brought the contagion with him from the "
36831	36855	36856	36857	CHAPTER IX	603	" sure enough , and was presently laid up with the smallpox , which spared the hall no more than it did the cottage .
36922	36937	36938	36939	Doctor Tusher	467	" It was a Providence , for which we all ought to be thankful , "
36942	36963	36938	36939	Doctor Tusher	467	" that my lady and her son were spared , while Death carried off the poor domestics of the house ; "
37292	37308	37285	37286	the lad	1365	" It IS worse and my mistress is not near so handsome as she was ; "
37473	37489	37495	37495	her	11267	" He is MY bear , and I will not have him baited , Doctor , "
37513	37526	37527	37527	she	11267	" How your hair has come off ! And mine , too , "
37533	37543	37544	37545	my lady	11267	" It is not for myself that I cared , "
37558	37575	37544	37545	my lady	11267	" but AM I very much changed ? Alas ! I fear ' tis too true . "
37576	37597	37598	37599	the lad	1365	" Madam , you have the dearest , and kindest , and sweetest face in the world , I think , "
37610	37621	37622	37623	the lady	1381	" Will my lord think so when he comes back ? "
37637	37713	37622	37623	the lady	1381	" Suppose he should think as you do , sir , that I am hideous yes , you said hideous he will cease to care for me . ' Tis all men care for in women , our little beauty . Why did he select me from among my sisters ? ' Twas only for that . We reign but for a day or two : and be sure that Vashti knew Esther was coming . "
37714	37717	37719	37720	Mr. Esmond	427	" Madam , "
37722	37745	37719	37720	Mr. Esmond	427	" Ahasuerus was the Grand Turk , and to change was the manner of his country , and according to his law . "
37746	37756	37758	37759	my lady	11267	" You are all Grand Turks for that matter , "
37761	37809	37758	37759	my lady	11267	" or would be if you could . Come , Frank , come , my child . You are well , praised be Heaven . YOUR locks are not thinned by this dreadful small - pox : nor your poor face scarred is it , my angel ? "
38428	38531	38420	38420	she	11267	" Harry , I beg your pardon for those cruel words I used on the night you were taken ill . I am shocked at the fate of the poor creature , and am sure that nothing had happened of that with which , in my anger , I charged you . And the very first day we go out , you must take me to the blacksmith , and we must see if there is anything I can do to console the poor old man . Poor man ! to lose both his children ! What should I do without mine ? "
38579	38587	38588	38588	he	3329	" The Lord gave and took away , "
39008	39015	39016	39017	my lord	1352	" What , Harry , boy ! "
39024	39060	39016	39017	my lord	1352	" you look as gaunt as a greyhound . The small - pox has n't improved your beauty , and your side of the house had n't never too much of it ho , ho ! "
39126	39134	39135	39135	she	2807	" Fie ! how yellow you look , "
39138	39152	39135	39135	she	2807	" and there are one , two , red holes in your face ; "
39196	39201	39203	39203	he	1352	" D - it ! "
39212	39271	39203	39203	he	1352	" the little slut sees everything . She saw the Dowager 's paint t'other day , and asked her why she wore that red stuff did n't you , Trix ? and the Tower ; and St. James 's ; and the play ; and the Prince George , and the Princess Anne did n't you , Trix ? "
39272	39284	39285	39286	the child	1607	" They are both very fat , and smelt of brandy , "

39312	39332	39334	39336	the young lady	3362	" Because your lordship smells of it after supper , when I embrace you before you go to bed , "
39363	39370	39372	39373	my lord	1352	" And now for my lady , "
41513	41530	41531	41531	he	1405	" D - it , now my lady is gone , we will have t'other bottle , "
41873	41884	41892	41892	her	494	" ' Twas after Jason left her , no doubt , "
41911	41923	41892	41892	her	494	" that Medea became a learned woman and a great enchantress . "

41941	41951	41936	41938	the young tutor	3507	" but she could not bring Jason back again . "
41952	41958	41960	41961	my lady	11267	" What do you mean ? "
41966	41972	41974	41975	the other	1781	" Indeed I mean nothing , "
42022	42023	42024	42034	The men who wrote your books , " says my lady	11879	" "
42031	42036	42037	42037	your	3511	" says my lady , "
42148	42149	42131	42131	I	0	" "
42159	42163	42131	42131	I	0	" says Esmond . "
42177	42182	42183	42183	They	11449	" answered the lady . "
42239	42256	42236	42237	Mr. Tutor	624	" And with a curtsy and a smile she would end this sort of colloquy . Indeed "
42260	42418	42257	42258	Mr. Tutor	624	" as my lady called Esmond , had now business enough on his hands in Castlewood house . He had three pupils , his lady and her two children , at whose lessons she would always be present ; besides writing my lord 's letters , and arranging his accompts for him when these could be got from Esmond 's indolent patron . Of the pupils the two young people were but lazy scholars , and as my lady would admit no discipline such as was then in use , my lord 's son only learned what he liked , which was but little , and never to his life 's end could be got to construe more than six lines of Virgil . Mistress Beatrix chattered French prettily , from a very early age ; and sang sweetly , but this was from her mother 's teaching not Harry Esmond 's , who could scarce distinguish between "
42421	42423	42424	42424	Lillibullero	626	" and "
42426	43871	42424	42424	Lillibullero	626	" although he had no greater delight in life than to hear the ladies sing . He sees them now will he ever forget them ? as they used to sit together of the summer evenings the two golden heads over the page the child 's little hand , and the mother 's beating the time , with their voices rising and falling in unison . But if the children were careless , ' twas a wonder how eagerly the mother learnt from her young tutor and taught him too . The happiest instinctive faculty was this lady 's a faculty for discerning latent beauties and hidden graces of books , especially books of poetry , as in a walk she would spy out field - flowers and make posies of them , such as no other hand could . She was a critic , not by reason but by feeling ; the sweetest commentator of those books they read together ; and the happiest hours of young Esmond 's life , perhaps , were those passed in the company of this kind mistress and her children . These happy days were to end soon , however ; and it was by the Lady Castlewood 's own decree that they were brought to a conclusion . It happened about Christmas - time , Harry Esmond being now past sixteen years of age , that his old comrade , adversary , and friend , Tom Tusher , returned from his school in London , a fair , well - grown , and sturdy lad , who was about to enter college , with an exhibition from his school , and a prospect of after promotion in the church . Tom Tusher 's talk was of nothing but Cambridge now ; and the boys , who were good friends , examined each other eagerly about their progress in books . Tom had learned some Greek and Hebrew , besides Latin , in which he was pretty well skilled , and also had given himself to mathematical studies under his father 's guidance , who was a proficient in those sciences , of which Esmond knew nothing ; nor could he write Latin so well as Tom , though he could talk it better , having been taught by his dear friend the Jesuit Father , for whose memory the lad ever retained the warmest affection , reading his books , keeping his swords clean in the little crypt where the Father had shown them to Esmond on the night of his visit ; and often of a night sitting in the chaplain 's room , which he inhabited , over his books , his verses , and rubbish , with which the lad occupied himself , he would look up at the window , thinking he wished it might open and let in the good Father . He had come and passed away like a dream ; but for the swords and books Harry might almost think the Father was an imagination of his mind and for two letters which had come to him , one from abroad , full of advice and affection , another soon after he had been confirmed by the Bishop of Hexton , in which Father Holt deplored his falling away . But Harry Esmond felt so confident now of his being in the right , and of his own powers as a casuist , that he thought he was able to face the Father himself in argument , and possibly convert him . To work upon the faith of her young pupil , Esmond 's kind mistress sent to the library of her father the Dean , who had been distinguished in the disputes of the late king 's reign ; and , an old soldier now , had hung up his weapons of controversy . These he took down from his shelves willingly for young Esmond , whom he benefited by his own personal advice and instruction . It did not require much persuasion to induce the boy to worship with his beloved mistress . And the good old nonjuring Dean flattered himself with a conversion which , in truth , was owing to a much gentler and fairer persuader . Under her ladyship 's kind eyes my lord 's being sealed in sleep pretty generally , Esmond read many volumes of the works of the famous British Divines of the last age , and was familiar with Wake and Sherlock , with Stillingfleet and Patrick . His mistress never tired to listen or to read , to pursue the texts with fond comments , to urge those points which her fancy dwelt on most , or her reason deemed most important . Since the death of her father the Dean , this lady hath admitted a certain latitude of theological reading which her orthodox father would never have allowed ; his favorite writers appealing more to reason and antiquity than to the passions or imaginations of their readers , so that the works of Bishop Taylor , nay , those of Mr. Baxter and Mr. Law , have in reality found more favor with my Lady Castlewood than the severer volumes of our great English schoolmen . In later life , at the University , Esmond reopened the controversy , and pursued it in a very different manner , when his patrons had determined for him that he was to embrace the ecclesiastical life . But though his mistress 's heart was in this calling , his own never was much . After that first fervor of simple devotion , which his beloved Jesuit priest had inspired in him , speculative theology took but little hold upon the young man 's mind . When his early credulity was disturbed , and his saints and virgins taken out of his worship , to rank little higher than the divinities of Olympus , his belief became acquiescence rather than ardor ; and he made his mind up to assume the cassock and bands , as another man does to wear a breastplate and jack - boots , or to mount a merchant 's desk , for a livelihood , and from obedience and necessity , rather than from choice . There were scores of such men in Mr. Esmond 's time at the universities , who were going to the church with no better calling than his . When Thomas Tusher was gone , a feeling of no small depression and disquiet fell upon young Esmond , of which , though he did not complain , his kind mistress must have divined the cause : for soon after she showed not only that she understood the reason of Harry 's melancholy , but could provide a remedy for it . Her habit was thus to watch , unobservedly , those to whom duty or affection bound her , and to prevent their designs , or to fulfil them , when she had the power . It was this lady 's disposition to think kindnesses , and devise silent bounties and to scheme benevolence , for those about her . We take such goodness , for the most part , as if it was our due ; the Marys who bring ointment for our feet get but little thanks . Some of us never feel this devotion at all , or are moved by it to gratitude or acknowledgment ; others only recall it years after , when the days are past in which those sweet kindnesses were spent on us , and we offer back our return for the debt by a poor tardy payment of tears . Then forgotten tones of love recur to us , and kind glances shine out of the past oh so bright and clear ! oh so longed after ! because they are out of reach ; as holiday music from withinside a prison wall or sunshine seen through the bars ; more prized because unattainable more bright because of the contrast of present darkness and solitude , whence there is no escape . All the notice , then , which Lady Castlewood seemed to take of Harry Esmond 's melancholy , upon Tom Tusher 's departure , was , by a gayety unusual to her , to attempt to dispel his gloom . She made his three scholars herself being the chief one more cheerful than ever they had been before , and more docile , too , all of them learning and reading much more than they had been accustomed to do . "
43876	43881	42424	42424	Lillibullero	626	" said the lady , "
43900	44086	42424	42424	Lillibullero	626	" Frank Esmond said he for his part did not want to learn any more , and cousin Harry might shut up his book whenever he liked , if he would come out a - fishing ; and little Beatrix declared she would send for Tom Tusher , and HE would be glad enough to come to Castlewood , if Harry chose to go away . At last comes a messenger from Winchester one day , bearer of a letter , with a great black seal , from the Dean there , to say that his sister was dead , and had left her fortune of 2,000L. among her six nieces , the Dean 's daughters ; and many a time since has Harry Esmond recalled the flushed face and eager look wherewith , after this intelligence , his kind lady regarded him . She did not pretend to any grief about the deceased relative , from whom she and her family had been many years parted . When my lord heard of the news , he also did not make any very long face . "
44168	44188	44156	44156	Harry	427	" said my lord , who was generous with his own , and indeed with other folk 's money . "
44215	44216	44217	44217	I	0	" "
44235	44244	44224	44224	I	0	" says my lady , turning very red . "
44259	44264	44254	44254	you	11425	" cries my lord . "
44281	44282	44283	44283	I	0	" "
44298	44319	44291	44291	you	1352	" My lord swore one of his large oaths that he did not know in the least what she meant . "
44334	44339	44331	44332	Cousin Harry	635	" says my lady , "
44364	44365	44362	44362	Harry	635	" "
44376	44388	44362	44362	Harry	635	" says my lord , for a moment looking rather sulky . "
44405	44415	44394	44394	You	0	" cry out Frank and Beatrix at one breath . "
44430	44443	44427	44427	his	635	" cries my lady , with blue eyes looking a celestial kindness : "
44456	44457	44454	44454	they	3551	" "
44471	44499	44463	44463	Rachel	464	" says my lord , seizing my lady 's hand , at which she blushed very much , and shrank back , putting her children before her . "
44508	44522	44500	44500	I	0	" he continued , giving Harry Esmond a hearty slap on the shoulder . "
44606	44607	44599	44599	God	527	" "
44630	44643	44620	44620	Father	509	" says little Frank , clapping his hands , and jumping up . "
44654	44689	44620	44620	Father	509	" And the other , in his delight and eagerness , was for leaving the room that instant to arrange about his journey . The Lady Castlewood looked after him with sad penetrating glances . "
44700	44714	44690	44690	He	427	" said she to her husband . The young man hung back abashed . "
44729	44733	44724	44725	your ladyship	11384	" he said . "
44746	44751	44744	44744	kinsman	11266	" said my lord . "
44800	44801	44802	44802	Ours	3571	" "
44812	44833	44802	44802	Ours	3571	" cries my lady , with a little of sadness and , maybe , of satire , in her voice : "
44889	44890	44892	44892	me	0	" "
44908	44913	44901	44901	thou	3579	" said my lord . "
44920	44932	44901	44901	thou	3579	" says she , still clinging by one of her children . "
44941	44965	44973	44973	he	0	" And she made him a grand curtsy , and , giving a stately look to Harry Esmond , which seemed to say , "
44977	44986	44970	44970	me	0	" she left the room with her children . "
44996	45000	44993	44993	Hexton	3582	" my lord said "
45037	45042	45018	45018	She	3581	" says my lord . "
45265	45429	45263	45263	Jove	582	" Indeed , I suppose they drank it together ; for my lord was often thick in his speech at mid - day dinner ; and at night at supper , speechless altogether . Harry Esmond 's departure resolved upon , it seemed as if the Lady Castlewood , too , rejoiced to lose him ; for more than once , when the lad , ashamed perhaps at his own secret eagerness to go away at any rate stricken with sadness at the idea of leaving those from whom he had received so many proofs of love and kindness inestimable , tried to express to his mistress his sense of gratitude to her , and his sorrow at quitting those who had so sheltered and tended a nameless and houseless orphan , Lady Castlewood cut short his protests of love and his lamentations , and would hear of no grief , but only look forward to Harry 's fame and prospects in life . "
45493	45519	45491	45491	Harry	427	" said she and this was the only time when she spoke with a tear in her eye , or a tremor in her voice , "
45580	45581	45578	45578	you	3605	" "
45592	45611	45589	45589	I	0	" said Harry Esmond , falling on his knees , and kissing the hand of his dearest mistress . "
45671	45672	45654	45654	your	3605	" "
45675	45679	45654	45654	your	3605	" says she ; "
45692	45693	45682	45682	I	0	" "
45697	45720	45682	45682	I	0	" cried Esmond for he knew what her life was , though he and his mistress never spoke a word concerning it . "
45745	45746	45742	45743	your servant	3616	" "
45754	45775	45749	45749	you	3605	" said my lady , laughing , as she put her hand on the boy 's head for a moment . "
45835	45836	45827	45827	I	0	" "
45846	45856	45827	45827	I	0	" Harry said , getting up from his knee . "
45871	45928	45929	45930	her knight	3622	" said my lady , laughing ; which speech made Harry Esmond start , and turn red ; for indeed the very thought was in his mind , that he would like that some chance should immediately happen whereby he might show his devotion . And it pleased him to think that his lady had called him "
45932	46266	45929	45930	her knight	3622	" and often and often he recalled this to his mind , and prayed that he might be her true knight , too . My lady 's bed - chamber window looked out over the country , and you could see from it the purple hills beyond Castlewood village , the green common betwixt that and the Hall , and the old bridge which crossed over the river . When Harry Esmond went away for Cambridge , little Frank ran alongside his horse as far as the bridge , and there Harry stopped for a moment , and looked back at the house where the best part of his life had been passed . It lay before him with its gray familiar towers , a pinnacle or two shining in the sun , the buttresses and terrace walls casting great blue shades on the grass . And Harry remembered , all his life after , how he saw his mistress at the window looking out on him in a white robe , the little Beatrix 's chestnut curls resting at her mother 's side . Both waved a farewell to him , and little Frank sobbed to leave him . Yes , he WOULD be his lady 's true knight , he vowed in his heart ; he waved her an adieu with his hat . The village people had Good - by to say to him too . All knew that Master Harry was going to college , and most of them had a kind word and a look of farewell . I do not stop to say what adventures he began to imagine , or what career to devise for himself before he had ridden three miles from home . He had not read Monsieur Galland 's ingenious Arabian tales as yet ; but be sure that there are other folks who build castles in the air , and have fine hopes , and kick them down too , besides honest Alnaschar .
46603	46614	46615	46615	she	3646	" ' Twas the only one fit for polite conversation , "
46620	46629	46615	46615	she	3646	" and suitable to persons of high breeding . "
46911	46914	46930	46930	she	3074	" Greyhound , "
48528	48531	48517	48517	him	521	" Amen ! "
50041	50048	50030	50030	He	427	" He has got a moustache ! "
50054	50067	50069	50070	Miss Beatrix	466	" Why does he not wear a peruke like my Lord Mohun ? "
50072	50083	50069	50070	Miss Beatrix	466	" My lord says that nobody wears their own hair . "
50084	50096	50098	50099	my lady	11267	" I believe you will have to occupy your old chamber , "
50101	50111	50098	50099	my lady	11267	" I hope the housekeeper has got it ready . "
50112	50128	50130	50130	Frank	597	" Why , mamma , you have been there ten times these three days yourself ! "
50132	50162	50165	50166	Miss Beatrix	466	" And she cut some flowers which you planted in my garden do you remember , ever so many years ago ? when I was quite a little girl , "
50171	50180	50165	50166	Miss Beatrix	466	" And mamma put them in your window . "
50181	50199	50201	50202	the lady	1381	" I remember when you grew well after you were ill that you used to like roses , "
50312	50338	50340	50341	the children	1777	" And you are not to be a page any longer , but a gentleman and kinsman , and to walk with papa and mamma , "
50620	50631	50637	50637	her	466	" I do n't think papa is fond of mamma , "
50686	50699	50701	50702	the boy	1347	" You should n't say that papa is not fond of mamma , "
50708	50725	50701	50702	the boy	1347	" Mamma never said so ; and mamma forbade you to say it , Miss Beatrix . "
52454	52560	52451	52451	his	1352	" D n it , Harry Esmond you see how my lady takes on about Frank 's megrim . She used to be sorry about me , my boy pass the tankard , Harry , and to be frightened if I had a headache once . She do n't care about my head now . They 're like that women are all the same , Harry , all jilts in their hearts . Stick to college stick to punch and buttery ale : and never see a woman that 's handsomer than an old cinder - faced bed - maker . That 's my counsel . "
53885	53891	53860	53860	he	1293	" Poor children poor children ! "
53948	53963	53937	53938	My lady	11267	" I suppose the person at Hexton has been ill , or has scolded him "
54567	54586	54562	54562	her	11267	" My lord , will you not fill a bumper too , and let me call a toast ? "
54587	54594	54596	54596	he	1396	" What is it , Rachel ? "
54607	54615	54621	54621	her	11267	" ' Tis the 29th of December , "
54627	54648	54621	54621	her	11267	" and my toast is , ' Harry and God bless him , who saved my boy 's life ! ' "
56280	56283	56273	56275	my Lady Prude	677	" Indeed , "
56288	56331	56284	56285	Lady Castlewood	494	" I liked his conversation well enough . ' Tis more amusing than that of most people I know . I thought it , I own , too free ; not from what he said , as rather from what he implied . "
56332	56343	56345	56346	her husband	1396	" Psha ! your ladyship does not know the world , "
56348	56365	56345	56346	her husband	1396	" and you have always been as squeamish as when you were a miss of fifteen . "
56366	56379	56284	56285	Lady Castlewood	494	" You found no fault when I was a miss at fifteen . "
56380	56412	56414	56415	my lord	1352	" Begad , madam , you are grown too old for a pinafore now ; and I hold that ' tis for me to judge what company my wife shall see , "
56421	56431	56433	56434	my lady	11267	" Indeed , Francis , I never thought otherwise , "
56498	56547	56548	56548	he	427	" By G - d ! Mohun is the best fellow in England ; and I 'll invite him here , just to plague that woman . Did you ever see such a frigid insolence as it is , Harry ? That 's the way she treats me , "
56568	56650	56560	56560	he	427	" I 'm nobody in my own house . I 'm to be the humble servant of that parson 's daughter . By Jove ! I 'd rather she should fling the dish at my head than sneer at me as she does . She puts me to shame before the children with her d d airs ; and , I 'll swear , tells Frank and Beaty that papa 's a reprobate , and that they ought to despise me . "
56651	56671	56672	56673	Harry Esmond	427	" Indeed and indeed , sir , I never heard her say a word but of respect regarding you , "
56676	56779	56672	56673	Harry Esmond	427	" No , curse it ! I wish she would speak . But she never does . She scorns me , and holds her tongue . She keeps off from me , as if I was a pestilence . By George ! she was fond enough of her pestilence once . And when I came a - courting , you would see miss blush blush red , by George ! for joy . Why , what do you think she said to me , Harry ? She said herself , when I joked with her about her d d smiling red cheeks : "
56863	56864	56855	56855	she	4227	" "
56884	56889	56877	56877	I	0	" Harry Esmond said ; "
56914	56915	56904	56904	she	4227	" "
56918	56924	56926	56926	you	0	" cries out my lord ; "
57021	57022	57014	57014	you	0	" "
57031	57039	57025	57025	sir	1424	" says Harry , with a smile . "
57221	57294	57201	57201	Damme	600	" And my lord again slapped the table , and took a great draught from the tankard . Harry Esmond admired as he listened to him , and thought how the poor preacher of this self - sacrifice had fled from the small - pox , which the lady had borne so cheerfully , and which had been the cause of so much disunion in the lives of all in this house . "
57300	57306	57201	57201	Damme	600	" thought the young man , "
57343	57371	57374	57374	sir	1424	" Harry 's heart was pained within him , to watch the struggles and pangs that tore the breast of this kind , manly friend and protector . "
57376	57380	57374	57374	sir	1424	" said he , "
57415	57813	57411	57411	she	11551	" But my lord flung away with one of his oaths , and a jeer ; he said that Parson Harry was a good fellow ; but that as for women , all women were alike all jades and heartless . So a man dashes a fine vase down , and despises it for being broken . It may be worthless true : but who had the keeping of it , and who shattered it ? Harry , who would have given his life to make his benefactress and her husband happy , bethought him , now that he saw what my lord 's state of mind was , and that he really had a great deal of that love left in his heart , and ready for his wife 's acceptance if she would take it , whether he could not be a means of reconciliation between these two persons , whom he revered the most in the world . And he cast about how he should break a part of his mind to his mistress , and warn her that in his , Harry 's opinion , at least , her husband was still her admirer , and even her lover . But he found the subject a very difficult one to handle , when he ventured to remonstrate , which he did in the very gravest tone , for long confidence and reiterated proofs of devotion and loyalty had given him a sort of authority in the house , which he resumed as soon as ever he returned to it , and with a speech that should have some effect , as , indeed , it was uttered with the speaker 's own heart , he ventured most gently to hint to his adored mistress that she was doing her husband harm by her ill opinion of him , and that the happiness of all the family depended upon setting her right . She , who was ordinarily calm and most gentle , and full of smiles and soft attentions , flushed up when young Esmond so spoke to her , and rose from her chair , looking at him with a haughtiness and indignation that he had never before known her to display . She was quite an altered being for that moment ; and looked an angry princess insulted by a vassal . "
57828	57843	57815	57815	you	4253	" she asked hastily , hissing out her words , and stamping her foot . "
57848	57855	57815	57815	you	4253	" Esmond said , looking down . "
57866	57870	57857	57857	you	4253	" she continued . "
57885	57889	57871	57871	I	0	" Harry answered , "
57901	57902	57857	57857	you	4253	" "
57913	57923	57924	57924	You	4253	" she went on , not regarding this speech . "
57972	57973	57958	57958	he	1352	" "
57983	57987	57958	57958	he	1352	" said Esmond . "
58135	58136	58125	58125	I	0	" "
58159	58163	58151	58151	I	0	" Esmond replied . "
58207	58218	58185	58185	I	0	" Lady Castlewood continued , still in a sarcastic tone . "
58287	58288	58269	58269	My	0	" "
58294	58298	58292	58292	madam	11439	" cried Harry . "
58379	58380	58366	58366	I	0	" "
58384	58395	58366	58366	I	0	" she said , looking at Esmond with wild eyes . "
58421	58429	58413	58413	you	0	" she added , after a pause , "
58463	59076	58458	58458	Henry	427	" And Harry went away from this colloquy , thinking still that the estrangement between his patron and his beloved mistress was remediable , and that each had at heart a strong attachment to the other . The intimacy between the Lords Mohun and Castlewood appeared to increase as long as the former remained in the country ; and my Lord of Castlewood especially seemed never to be happy out of his new comrade 's sight . They sported together , they drank , they played bowls and tennis : my Lord Castlewood would go for three days to Sark , and bring back my Lord Mohun to Castlewood where indeed his lordship made himself very welcome to all persons , having a joke or a new game at romps for the children , all the talk of the town for my lord , and music and gallantry and plenty of the beau langage for my lady , and for Harry Esmond , who was never tired of hearing his stories of his campaigns and his life at Vienna , Venice , Paris , and the famous cities of Europe which he had visited both in peace and war . And he sang at my lady 's harpsichord , and played cards or backgammon , or his new game of billiards with my lord of whom he invariably got the better always having a consummate good - humor , and bearing himself with a certain manly grace , that might exhibit somewhat of the camp and Alsatia perhaps , but that had its charm , and stamped him a gentleman : and his manner to Lady Castlewood was so devoted and respectful , that she soon recovered from the first feelings of dislike which she had conceived against him nay , before long , began to be interested in his spiritual welfare , and hopeful of his conversion , lending him books of piety , which he promised dutifully to study . With her my lord talked of reform , of settling into quiet life , quitting the court and town , and buying some land in the neighborhood though it must be owned that , when the two lords were together over their Burgundy after dinner , their talk was very different , and there was very little question of conversion on my Lord Mohun 's part . When they got to their second bottle , Harry Esmond used commonly to leave these two noble topers , who , though they talked freely enough , heaven knows , in his presence Good Lord , what a set of stories , of Alsatia and Spring Garden , of the taverns and gaming - houses , of the ladies of the court , and mesdames of the theatres , he can recall out of their godly conversation ! although , I say , they talked before Esmond freely , yet they seemed pleased when he went away , and then they had another bottle , and then they fell to cards , and then my Lord Mohun came to her ladyship 's drawing - room ; leaving his boon companion to sleep off his wine . ' Twas a point of honor with the fine gentlemen of those days to lose or win magnificently at their horse - matches , or games of cards and dice and you could never tell , from the demeanor of these two lords afterwards , which had been successful and which the loser at their games . And when my lady hinted to my lord that he played more than she liked , he dismissed her with a "
59079	59559	58458	58458	Henry	427	" and swore that nothing was more equal than play betwixt gentlemen , if they did but keep it up long enough . And these kept it up long enough , you may be sure . A man of fashion of that time often passed a quarter of his day at cards , and another quarter at drink : I have known many a pretty fellow , who was a wit too , ready of repartee , and possessed of a thousand graces , who would be puzzled if he had to write more than his name . There is scarce any thoughtful man or woman , I suppose , but can look back upon his course of past life , and remember some point , trifling as it may have seemed at the time of occurrence , which has nevertheless turned and altered his whole career . ' Tis with almost all of us , as in M. Massillon 's magnificent image regarding King William , a grain de sable that perverts or perhaps overthrows us ; and so it was but a light word flung in the air , a mere freak of perverse child 's temper , that brought down a whole heap of crushing woes upon that family whereof Harry Esmond formed a part . Coming home to his dear Castlewood in the third year of his academical course , wherein he had now obtained some distinction , his Latin Poem on the death of the Duke of Gloucester , Princess Anne of Denmark 's son , having gained him a medal , and introduced him to the society of the University wits , Esmond found his little friend and pupil Beatrix grown to be taller than her mother , a slim and lovely young girl , with cheeks mantling with health and roses : with eyes like stars shining out of azure , with waving bronze hair clustered about the fairest young forehead ever seen : and a mien and shape haughty and beautiful , such as that of the famous antique statue of the huntress Diana at one time haughty , rapid , imperious , with eyes and arrows that dart and kill . Harry watched and wondered at this young creature , and likened her in his mind to Artemis with the ringing bow and shafts flashing death upon the children of Niobe ; at another time she was coy and melting as Luna shining tenderly upon Endymion . This fair creature , this lustrous Phoebe , was only young as yet , nor had nearly reached her full splendor : but crescent and brilliant , our young gentleman of the University , his head full of poetical fancies , his heart perhaps throbbing with desires undefined , admired this rising young divinity ; and gazed at her though only as at some "
59564	59753	58458	58458	Henry	427	" far above his earth with endless delight and wonder . She had been a coquette from the earliest times almost , trying her freaks and jealousies , her wayward frolics and winning caresses , upon all that came within her reach ; she set her women quarrelling in the nursery , and practised her eyes on the groom as she rode behind him on the pillion . She was the darling and torment of father and mother . She intrigued with each secretly ; and bestowed her fondness and withdrew it , plied them with tears , smiles , kisses , cajolements ; when the mother was angry , as happened often , flew to the father , and sheltering behind him , pursued her victim ; when both were displeased , transferred her caresses to the domestics , or watched until she could win back her parents ' good graces , either by surprising them into laughter and good - humor , or appeasing them by submission and artful humility . She was saevo laeta negotio , like that fickle goddess Horace describes , and of whose "
59756	60369	60383	60383	My	0	" a great poet of our own has written so nobly who , famous and heroic as he was , was not strong enough to resist the torture of women . It was but three years before that the child , then but ten years old , had nearly managed to make a quarrel between Harry Esmond and his comrade , good - natured , phlegmatic Thomas Tusher , who never of his own seeking quarrelled with anybody : by quoting to the latter some silly joke which Harry had made regarding him it was the merest idlest jest , though it near drove two old friends to blows , and I think such a battle would have pleased her and from that day Tom kept at a distance from her ; and she respected him , and coaxed him sedulously whenever they met . But Harry was much more easily appeased , because he was fonder of the child : and when she made mischief , used cutting speeches , or caused her friends pain , she excused herself for her fault , not by admitting and deploring it , but by pleading not guilty , and asserting innocence so constantly , and with such seeming artlessness , that it was impossible to question her plea . In her childhood , they were but mischiefs then which she did ; but her power became more fatal as she grew older as a kitten first plays with a ball , and then pounces on a bird and kills it . ' Tis not to be imagined that Harry Esmond had all this experience at this early stage of his life , whereof he is now writing the history many things here noted were but known to him in later days . Almost everything Beatrix did or undid seemed good , or at least pardonable , to him then , and years afterwards . It happened , then , that Harry Esmond came home to Castlewood for his last vacation , with good hopes of a fellowship at his college , and a contented resolve to advance his fortune that way . ' Twas in the first year of the present century , Mr. Esmond as far as he knew the period of his birth being then twenty - two years old . He found his quondam pupil shot up into this beauty of which we have spoken , and promising yet more : her brother , my lord 's son , a handsome high - spirited brave lad , generous and frank , and kind to everybody , save perhaps his sister , with whom Frank was at war and not from his but her fault adoring his mother , whose joy he was : and taking her side in the unhappy matrimonial differences which were now permanent , while of course Mistress Beatrix ranged with her father . When heads of families fall out , it must naturally be that their dependants wear the one or the other party 's color ; and even in the parliaments in the servants ' hall or the stables , Harry , who had an early observant turn , could see which were my lord 's adherents and which my lady 's , and conjecture pretty shrewdly how their unlucky quarrel was debated . Our lackeys sit in judgment on us . My lord 's intrigues may be ever so stealthily conducted , but his valet knows them ; and my lady 's woman carries her mistress 's private history to the servants ' scandal market , and exchanges it against the secrets of other abigails .
60638	60646	60648	60649	Mr. Esmond	427	" And when I am a parson , "
60651	60661	60648	60649	Mr. Esmond	427	" will you give me no custard , Beatrix ? "
60662	60668	60669	60669	Beatrix	466	" You you are different , "
60672	60679	60669	60669	Beatrix	466	" You are of our blood . "
60680	60692	60694	60695	my lady	11267	" My father was a parson , as you call him , "
60697	60706	60694	60695	my lady	11267	" But mine is a peer of Ireland , "
60715	60758	60712	60712	her	466	" Let people know their places . I suppose you will have me go down on my knees and ask a blessing of Mr. Thomas Tusher , that has just been made a curate and whose mother was a waiting - maid . "
60852	60866	60868	60869	my lady	11267	" But men promise more than they are able to perform in marriage , "
60875	60955	60957	60958	my lady	11267	" I fear he has lost large sums ; and our property , always small , is dwindling away under this reckless dissipation . I heard of him in London with very wild company . Since his return , letters and lawyers are constantly coming and going : he seems to me to have a constant anxiety , though he hides it under boisterousness and laughter . I looked through through the door last night , and and before , "
60960	61001	60957	60958	my lady	11267	" and saw them at cards after midnight ; no estate will bear that extravagance , much less ours , which will be so diminished that my son will have nothing at all , and my poor Beatrix no portion ! "
61002	61012	61014	61015	Harry Esmond	427	" I wish I could help you , madam , "
61033	61040	61042	61043	Lady Esmond	598	" Who can ? Only God , "
61044	61054	61062	61062	his	427	" only God , in whose hands we are . "
61405	61418	61419	61419	Beatrix	466	" When thou art old enough , thou shalt marry Lord Mohun , "
61434	61442	61427	61428	the girl	2907	" I would rather marry Tom Tusher . "
61482	61505	61479	61479	Beatrix	466	" I think my lord would rather marry mamma than marry me ; and is waiting till you die to ask her . "
61584	61656	61565	61566	the girl	2907	" I am sure I meant no wrong ; I am sure mamma talks a great deal more to Harry Esmond than she does to papa and she cried when Harry went away , and she never does when papa goes away ! and last night she talked to Lord Mohun for ever so long , and sent us out of the room , and cried when we came back , and "
61657	61661	61664	61666	my Lord Castlewood	676	" D n ! "
61673	61684	61686	61686	he	676	" Go out of the room , you little viper ! "
61695	61707	61708	61709	her ladyship	1357	" Ask Lord Mohun what I said to him , Francis , "
61735	61743	61730	61730	her	1357	" Come away with me , Beatrix . "
61755	61764	61765	61765	she	466	" Dearest mamma , what have I done ? "
61768	61775	61765	61765	she	466	" Sure I meant no harm . "
61791	61805	61806	61806	my	0	" I will tell you what your wife said to me , Frank , "
61811	61872	61808	61808	Mohun	676	" Parson Harry may hear it ; and , as I hope for heaven , every word I say is true . Last night , with tears in her eyes , your wife implored me to play no more with you at dice or at cards , and you know best whether what she asked was not for your good . "
61873	61882	61884	61885	my lord	1352	" Of course , it was , Mohun , "
61892	61913	61884	61885	my lord	1352	" Of course you are a model of a man : and the world knows what a saint you are . "
61941	61966	61970	61970	Mohun	676	" I am no saint , though your wife is and I can answer for my actions as other people must for their words , "
61972	61982	61984	61985	the other	1781	" By G , my lord , you shall , "
61990	62003	62005	62006	Lord Mohun	676	" We have another little account to settle first , my lord , "
62040	62044	62045	62045	he	427	" Gracious heavens ! "
62048	62169	62045	62045	he	427	" my lord , are you going to draw a sword upon your friend in your own house ? Can you doubt the honor of a lady who is as pure as heaven , and would die a thousand times rather than do you a wrong ? Are the idle words of a jealous child to set friends at variance ? Has not my mistress , as much as she dared do , besought your lordship , as the truth must be told , to break your intimacy with my Lord Mohun ; and to give up the habit which may bring ruin on your family ? But for my Lord Mohun 's illness , had he not left you ? "
62170	62191	62196	62196	Mohun	676	" ' Faith , Frank , a man with a gouty toe ca n't run after other men 's wives , "
62245	62254	62242	62242	his	676	" it , Harry , I believe thee , "
62285	62293	62295	62295	Harry	427	" Go , bring my lady back , "
62356	62370	62371	62371	she	2930	" Thank you , and God bless you , my dear brother Harry , "
62440	62460	62464	62464	Mohun	676	" ' Tis time for me to go to roost . I will have my gruel a - bed , "
62476	62486	62487	62487	he	676	" By George , that woman is a pearl ! "
62490	62514	62487	62487	he	676	" and ' tis only a pig that would n't value her . Have you seen the vulgar traipsing orange - girl whom Esmond "
62682	62691	62679	62679	he	676	" You heard what Mohun said , parson ? "
62692	62700	62679	62679	he	676	" That my lady was a saint ? "
62701	62920	62679	62679	he	676	" That there are two accounts to settle . I have been going wrong these five years , Harry Esmond . Ever since you brought that damned small - pox into the house , there has been a fate pursuing me , and I had best have died of it , and not run away from it like a coward . I left Beatrix with her relations , and went to London ; and I fell among thieves , Harry , and I got back to confounded cards and dice , which I had n't touched since my marriage no , not since I was in the Duke 's Guard , with those wild Mohocks . And I have been playing worse and worse , and going deeper and deeper into it ; and I owe Mohun two thousand pounds now ; and when it 's paid I am little better than a beggar . I do n't like to look my boy in the face ; he hates me , I know he does . And I have spent Beaty 's little portion : and the Lord knows what will come if I live ; the best thing I can do is to die , and release what portion of the estate is redeemable for the boy . "
63281	63286	63288	63288	Harry	427	" Indeed , madam , "
63290	63325	63288	63288	Harry	427	" you know not what it costs you ; and ' tis easy for any observer who knows the game , to see that Lord Mohun is by far the stronger of the two . "
63326	63332	63334	63335	my lady	11267	" I know he is , "
63344	63361	63334	63335	my lady	11267	" he is not only the best player , but the kindest player in the world . "
63362	63367	63368	63368	Esmond	427	" Madam , madam ! "
63375	63398	63368	63368	Esmond	427	" Debts of honor must be paid some time or other ; and my master will be ruined if he goes on . "
63399	63409	63420	63420	her	11267	" Harry , shall I tell you a secret ? "
63423	63575	63420	63420	her	11267	" Francis will not be ruined if he goes on ; he will be rescued if he goes on . I repent of having spoken and thought unkindly of the Lord Mohun when he was here in the past year . He is full of much kindness and good ; and ' tis my belief that we shall bring him to better things . I have lent him ' Tillotson ' and your favorite ' Bishop Taylor , ' and he is much touched , he says ; and as a proof of his repentance and herein lies my secret what do you think he is doing with Francis ? He is letting poor Frank win his money back again . He hath won already at the last four nights ; and my Lord Mohun says that he will not be the means of injuring poor Frank and my dear children . "
63576	63592	63594	63594	Esmond	427	" And in God 's name , what do you return him for the sacrifice ? "
63624	63638	63656	63657	my lady	11267	" How , in heaven 's name , are you to pay him ? "
63639	63654	63656	63657	my lady	11267	" Pay him ! With a mother 's blessing and a wife 's prayers ! "
63875	63886	63850	63850	she	494	" And this is the good meddlers get of interfering , "
64413	64450	64411	64411	Harry	427	" My lord , if you will kindly give me a place by your side I will thank you ; I have much to say to you , and would like to speak to you alone . "
64451	64465	64467	64468	the other	1781	" You honor me by giving me your confidence , Mr. Henry Esmond , "
64555	64559	64561	64562	Harry Esmond	427	" My lord , "
64595	64605	64561	64562	Harry Esmond	427	" my lord , I studied medicine at Cambridge . "
64606	64612	64614	64614	he	427	" Indeed , Parson Harry , "
64616	64635	64614	64614	he	427	" and are you going to take out a diploma : and cure your fellow - students of the "
64636	64641	64643	64643	Harry	584	" Of the gout , "
64656	64666	64643	64643	Harry	584	" I know a good deal about the gout . "
64667	64682	64684	64685	my lord	1352	" I hope you may never have it . ' Tis an infernal disease , "
64687	64696	64698	64698	he	427	" and its twinges are diabolical . Ah ! "
64713	64735	64736	64736	Harry	584	" Your lordship would be much better if you took off all that flannel it only serves to inflame the toe , "
64747	64761	64763	64764	the other	1781	" Oh ! it only serves to inflame the toe , does it ? "
64771	64791	64793	64793	Harry	584	" If you took off that flannel , and flung that absurd slipper away , and wore a boot , "
64795	64804	64793	64793	Harry	584	" You recommend me boots , Mr. Esmond ? "
64809	64830	64831	64831	Harry	427	" Yes , boots and spurs . I saw your lordship three days ago run down the gallery fast enough , "
64835	64877	64831	64831	Harry	427	" I am sure that taking gruel at night is not so pleasant as claret to your lordship ; and besides it keeps your lordship 's head cool for play , whilst my patron 's is hot and flustered with drink . "
64878	64895	64897	64898	my lord	1352	" ' Sdeath , sir , you dare not say that I do n't play fair ? "
64911	64921	64922	64922	Harry	427	" You are cool when my lord is drunk , "
64925	64947	64922	64922	Harry	427	" your lordship gets the better of my patron . I have watched you as I looked up from my books . "
64948	64953	64955	64956	Lord Mohun	676	" You young Argus ! "
64981	65097	64922	64922	Harry	427	" You young Argus ! you may look with all your hundred eyes and see we play fair . I 've played away an estate of a night , and I 've played my shirt off my back ; and I 've played away my periwig and gone home in a nightcap . But no man can say I ever took an advantage of him beyond the advantage of the game . I played a dice - cogging scoundrel in Alsatia for his ears and won 'em , and have one of 'em in my lodging in Bow Street in a bottle of spirits . Harry Mohun will play any man for anything always would . "
65098	65114	65115	65115	Harry	695	" You are playing awful stakes , my lord , in my patron 's house , "
65118	65128	65115	65115	Harry	695	" and more games than are on the cards . "
65129	65137	65149	65149	his	1352	" What do you mean , sir ? "
65152	65156	65158	65158	Harry	695	" I mean , "
65165	65177	65158	65158	Harry	695	" that your gout is well if ever you had it . "
65178	65181	65183	65184	my lord	1352	" Sir ! "
65189	65235	65183	65184	my lord	1352	" And to tell the truth I believe your lordship has no more gout than I have . At any rate , change of air will do you good , my Lord Mohun . And I mean fairly that you had better go from Castlewood . "
65236	65247	65249	65251	the Lord Mohun	676	" And were you appointed to give me this message ? "
65253	65260	65249	65251	the Lord Mohun	676	" Did Frank Esmond commission you ? "
65261	65277	65183	65184	my lord	1352	" No one did . ' Twas the honor of my family that commissioned me . "
65278	65287	65289	65290	the other	1781	" And you are prepared to answer this ? "
65297	65315	65289	65290	the other	1781	" Quite , my lord : your lordship will upset the carriage if you whip so hotly . "
65316	65326	65327	65328	my lord	1352	" By George , you have a brave spirit ! "
65337	65353	65354	65354	he	1352	" I suppose ' tis that infernal botte de Jesuite that makes you so bold , "
65357	65372	65354	65354	he	1352	" ' Tis the peace of the family I love best in the world , "
65377	65544	65571	65571	his	1352	" ' tis the honor of a noble benefactor the happiness of my dear mistress and her children . I owe them everything in life , my lord ; and would lay it down for any one of them . What brings you here to disturb this quiet household ? What keeps you lingering month after month in the country ? What makes you feign illness , and invent pretexts for delay ? Is it to win my poor patron 's money ? Be generous , my lord , and spare his weakness for the sake of his wife and children . Is it to practise upon the simple heart of a virtuous lady ? You might as well storm the Tower single - handed . But you may blemish her name by light comments on it , or by lawless pursuits and I do n't deny that ' tis in your power to make her unhappy . Spare these innocent people , and leave them . "
65545	65565	65571	65571	his	1352	" By the Lord , I believe thou hast an eye to the pretty Puritan thyself , Master Harry , "
65597	65622	65582	65582	he	1352	" Whisper , Harry . Art thou in love with her thyself ? Hath tipsy Frank Esmond come by the way of all flesh ? "
65623	65630	65632	65632	Harry	427	" My lord , my lord , "
65645	65737	65642	65642	he	427	" I never had a mother , but I love this lady as one . I worship her as a devotee worships a saint . To hear her name spoken lightly seems blasphemy to me . Would you dare think of your own mother so , or suffer any one so to speak of her ? It is a horror to me to fancy that any man should think of her impurely . I implore you , I beseech you , to leave her . Danger will come out of it . "
65738	65743	65745	65746	my lord	1352	" Danger , psha ! "
66051	66059	66061	66062	my lord	1352	" Great God ! he 's dead ! "
66064	66088	66061	66062	my lord	1352	" Ride , some one : fetch a doctor stay . I 'll go home and bring back Tusher ; he knows surgery , "
66288	66317	66284	66285	the boy	1347	" We met mamma , who was walking on the terrace with the doctor , and papa frightened her , and told her you were dead . . . "
66318	66324	66326	66326	Harry	427	" That I was dead ! "
66328	66450	66284	66285	the boy	1347	" Yes . Papa says : ' Here 's poor Harry killed , my dear ; ' on which mamma gives a great scream ; and oh , Harry ! she drops down ; and I thought she was dead too . And you never saw such a way as papa was in : he swore one of his great oaths : and he turned quite pale ; and then he began to laugh somehow , and he told the Doctor to take his horse , and me to follow him ; and we left him . And I looked back , and saw him dashing water out of the fountain on to mamma . Oh , she was so frightened ! "
66568	66576	66577	66577	she	4508	" Thank heaven , you are safe , "
66580	66589	66591	66592	little Frank	696	" And so is Harry too , mamma , "
66594	66597	66591	66592	little Frank	696	" huzzay ! "
66655	66669	66670	66671	Lady Castlewood	494	" Oh , my boy ! what a fright you have given me ! "
66965	66978	66979	66980	my lord	1352	" I shall see you in London before very long , Mohun , "
66987	66996	66979	66980	my lord	1352	" when we will settle our accounts together . "
66997	67007	67009	67010	the other	1781	" Do not let them trouble you , Frank , "
67466	67480	67447	67447	her	494	" Follow them , Harry , I am sure something has gone wrong . "
67685	67705	67706	67707	Lady Castlewood	494	" He paces his room all night ; what is it ? Henry , find out what it is , "
67715	67724	67725	67725	she	494	" He has sent three letters to London , "
67731	67742	67725	67725	she	494	" Indeed , madam , they were to a lawyer , "
67786	67807	67774	67776	the young man	1523	" He was only raising money to pay off an old debt on the property , which must be discharged . "
67888	67902	67904	67905	Mr. Congreve	662	" There are few men who will make such a sacrifice for them , "
68519	68522	68514	68515	my lord	1352	" Trumpet , "
68709	68720	68722	68723	Mr. Esmond	427	" I thought the Lord Mohun had been in Paris ! "
68731	68740	68744	68744	Viscount	440	" He is come back at my invitation , "
68746	68754	68744	68744	Viscount	440	" We have accounts to settle together . "
68755	68765	68767	68767	Esmond	427	" I pray heaven they are over , sir , "
68769	68774	68776	68777	the other	1781	" Oh , quite , "
68786	68828	68776	68777	the other	1781	" He was rather troublesome about that money which I told you I had lost to him at play . And now ' tis paid , and we are quits on that score , and we shall meet good friends again . "
68829	68833	68836	68836	Esmond	427	" My lord , "
68838	68860	68836	68836	Esmond	427	" I am sure you are deceiving me , and that there is a quarrel between the Lord Mohun and you . "
68861	68908	68776	68777	the other	1781	" Quarrel pish ! We shall sup together this very night , and drink a bottle . Every man is ill - humored who loses such a sum as I have lost . But now ' tis paid , and my anger is gone with it . "
68909	68917	68919	68919	Harry	427	" Where shall we sup , sir ? "
68921	68933	68936	68937	Lord Viscount	440	" WE ! Let some gentlemen wait till they are asked , "
68942	68990	68936	68937	Lord Viscount	440	" You go to Duke Street , and see Mr. Betterton . You love the play , I know . Leave me to follow my own devices : and in the morning we 'll breakfast together , with what appetite we may , as the play says . "
68991	69006	69008	69009	Harry Esmond	427	" By G ! my lord , I will not leave you this night , "
69011	69061	69008	69009	Harry Esmond	427	" I think I know the cause of your dispute . I swear to you ' tis nothing . On the very day the accident befell Lord Mohun , I was speaking to him about it . I know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry on his part . "
69062	69079	69081	69082	my lord	1352	" You know that nothing has passed but idle gallantry between Lord Mohun and my wife , "
69088	69099	69081	69082	my lord	1352	" you knew of this and did not tell me ? "
69100	69145	69008	69009	Harry Esmond	427	" I knew more of it than my dear mistress did herself , sir a thousand times more . How was she , who was as innocent as a child , to know what was the meaning of the covert addresses of a villain ? "
69146	69165	69008	69009	Harry Esmond	427	" A villain he is , you allow , and would have taken my wife away from me . "
69166	69177	69179	69180	young Esmond	427	" Sir , she is as pure as an angel , "
69182	69191	69179	69180	young Esmond	427	" Have I said a word against her ? "
69197	69558	69179	69180	young Esmond	427	" Did I ever doubt that she was pure ? It would have been the last day of her life when I did . Do you fancy I think that SHE would go astray ? No , she has n't passion enough for that . She neither sins nor forgives . I know her temper and now I 've lost her , by heaven I love her ten thousand times more than ever I did yes , when she was as young and as beautiful as an angel when she smiled at me in her old father 's house , and used to lie in wait for me there as I came from hunting when I used to fling my head down on her little knees and cry like a child on her lap and swear I would reform , and drink no more and play no more , and follow women no more ; when all the men of the Court used to be following her when she used to look with her child more beautiful , by George , than the Madonna in the Queen 's Chapel . I am not good like her , I know it . Who is by heaven , who is ? I tired and wearied her , I know that very well . I could not talk to her . You men of wit and books could do that , and I could n't I felt I could n't . Why , when you was but a boy of fifteen I could hear you two together talking your poetry and your books till I was in such a rage that I was fit to strangle you . But you were always a good lad , Harry , and I loved you , you know I did . And I felt she did n't belong to me : and the children do n't . And I besotted myself , and gambled and drank , and took to all sorts of deviltries out of despair and fury . And now comes this Mohun , and she likes him , I know she likes him . "
69559	69573	69574	69574	Esmond	427	" Indeed , and on my soul , you are wrong , sir , "
69577	69584	69574	69574	Esmond	427	" She takes letters from him , "
69588	69594	69596	69596	he	1352	" look here , Harry , "
69610	69699	69596	69596	he	1352	" It fell from him that day he was n't killed . One of the grooms picked it up from the ground and gave it me . Here it is in their d d comedy jargon . ' Divine Gloriana Why look so coldly on your slave who adores you ? Have you no compassion on the tortures you have seen me suffering ? Do you vouchsafe no reply to billets that are written with the blood of my heart . ' She had more letters from him . "
69700	69706	69708	69708	Esmond	427	" But she answered none , "
69710	69718	69720	69721	my lord	1352	" That 's not Mohun 's fault , "
69723	69741	69720	69721	my lord	1352	" and I will be revenged on him , as God 's in heaven , I will . "
69742	69766	69767	69767	Esmond	427	" For a light word or two , will you risk your lady 's honor and your family 's happiness , my lord ? "
69771	69784	69786	69787	my lord	1352	" Psha there shall be no question of my wife 's honor , "
69789	69877	69786	69787	my lord	1352	" we can quarrel on plenty of grounds beside . If I live , that villain will be punished ; if I fall , my family will be only the better : there will only be a spendthrift the less to keep in the world : and Frank has better teaching than his father . My mind is made up , Harry Esmond , and whatever the event is , I am easy about it . I leave my wife and you as guardians to the children . "
69941	70001	70020	70021	my lord	1352	" My lord , if you are determined upon war , you must not go into it alone . ' Tis the duty of our house to stand by its chief ; and I should neither forgive myself nor you if you did not call me , or I should be absent from you at a moment of danger . "
70002	70018	70020	70021	my lord	1352	" Why , Harry , my poor boy , you are bred for a parson , "
70031	70046	70020	70021	my lord	1352	" and it were a great pity that you should meddle in the matter . "
70047	70057	70058	70058	Harry	427	" Your lordship thought of being a churchman once , "
70061	70115	70058	70058	Harry	427	" and your father 's orders did not prevent him fighting at Castlewood against the Roundheads . Your enemies are mine , sir ; I can use the foils , as you have seen , indifferently well , and do n't think I shall be afraid when the buttons are taken off 'em . "
70187	70197	70199	70199	Harry	427	" And I should have beat him , sir , "
70203	70257	70199	70199	Harry	427	" He never could parry that botte I brought from Cambridge . Let us have half an hour of it , and rehearse I can teach it your lordship : ' tis the most delicate point in the world , and if you miss it , your adversary 's sword is through you . "
70258	70274	70276	70277	my lord	1352	" By George , Harry , you ought to be the head of the house , "
70281	70296	70297	70297	he	1352	" You had been a better Lord Castlewood than a lazy sot like me , "
70318	70335	70337	70337	Harry	427	" Let us take our coats off and have half an hour 's practice before nightfall , "
70348	70359	70361	70362	my lord	1352	" You are but a little bit of a lad , "
70368	70388	70389	70389	he	1352	" but , in faith , I believe you could do for that fellow . No , my boy , "
70392	70424	70389	70389	he	1352	" I 'll have none of your feints and tricks of stabbing : I can use my sword pretty well too , and will fight my own quarrel my own way . "
70425	70436	70438	70438	Harry	427	" But I shall be by to see fair play ? "
70440	70451	70464	70464	he	427	" Yes , God bless you you shall be by . "
70452	70459	70461	70461	Harry	427	" When is it , sir ? "
70479	70626	70628	70629	my lord	1352	" ' Tis arranged thus : I sent off a courier to Jack Westbury to say that I wanted him specially . He knows for what , and will be here presently , and drink part of that bottle of sack . Then we shall go to the theatre in Duke Street , where we shall meet Mohun ; and then we shall all go sup at the ' Rose ' or the ' Greyhound . ' Then we shall call for cards , and there will be probably a difference over the cards and then , God help us ! either a wicked villain and traitor shall go out of the world , or a poor worthless devil , that does n't care to remain in it . I am better away , Hal my wife will be all the happier when I am gone , "
70658	70673	70674	70675	my lord	1352	" The business was talked over with Mohun before he left home Castlewood I mean "
70679	70719	70674	70675	my lord	1352	" I took the letter in to him , which I had read , and I charged him with his villainy , and he could make no denial of it , only he said that my wife was innocent . "
70720	70735	70737	70737	Harry	427	" And so she is ; before heaven , my lord , she is ! "
70739	70750	70752	70753	my lord	1352	" No doubt , no doubt . They always are , "
70755	70771	70752	70753	my lord	1352	" No doubt , when she heard he was killed , she fainted from accident . "
70772	70783	70786	70786	Esmond	427	" But , my lord , MY name is Harry , "
70791	70803	70786	70786	Esmond	427	" You told my lady , ' Harry was killed ! ' "
70804	70813	70815	70816	my lord	1352	" Damnation ! shall I fight you too ? "
70821	70856	70815	70816	my lord	1352	" Are you , you little serpent , warmed by my fire , going to sting YOU ? No , my boy , you 're an honest boy ; you are a good boy . "
70871	70929	70859	70859	he	427	" You are an honest boy , and I love you ; and , by heavens , I am so wretched that I do n't care what sword it is that ends me . Stop , here 's Jack Westbury . Well , Jack ! Welcome , old boy ! This is my kinsman , Harry Esmond . "
70930	70942	70944	70944	Harry	427	" Who brought your bowls for you at Castlewood , sir ? "
70967	70973	70975	70976	my lord	1352	" Harry is number three , "
70978	70989	70975	70976	my lord	1352	" You need n't be afraid of him , Jack . "
71003	71015	70991	70992	the Colonel	2816	" Indeed , he do n't look as if I need . "
71146	71152	71143	71144	Mr. Wycherley	487	" Love in a Wood . "
71437	71440	71433	71433	Lockit	708	" Greyhound , "
71517	71521	71545	71545	Westbury	709	" Christian Hero , "
71577	71588	71590	71591	the Colonel	2816	" There was no need for more seconds than one , "
71593	71604	71590	71591	the Colonel	2816	" and the Captain or Lord Warwick might easily withdraw . "
71732	71735	71738	71739	Lord Mohun	676	" Psha ! "
71763	71779	71738	71739	Lord Mohun	676	" Young gentlemen from college should not play these stakes . You are too young . "
71780	71789	71792	71792	Harry	427	" Who dares say I am too young ? "
71794	71800	71792	71792	Harry	427	" Is your lordship afraid ? "
71801	71804	71807	71807	Mohun	676	" Afraid ! "
71817	71828	71830	71830	he	440	" I 'll play you for ten moidores , Mohun , "
71832	71850	71830	71830	he	440	" You silly boy , we do n't play for groats here as you do at Cambridge . "
71897	71907	71909	71911	the Lord Mohun	676	" I 'll stake the young gentleman a crown , "
71915	71929	71931	71931	Harry	427	" I thought crowns were rather scarce with the gentlemen of the army , "
71933	71940	71942	71943	the Captain	2533	" Do they birch at College ? "
71945	71950	71952	71952	Harry	427	" They birch fools , "
71954	71968	71952	71952	Harry	427	" and they cane bullies , and they fling puppies into the water . "
71969	71980	71982	71983	the Captain	2533	" Faith , then , there 's some escapes drowning , "
72036	72057	72034	72034	Viscount	440	" The Deuce take you , Mohun , how damned awkward you are . Light the candle , you drawer . "
72058	72070	72072	72073	the other	1781	" Damned awkward is a damned awkward expression , my lord , "
72075	72090	72072	72073	the other	1781	" Town gentlemen do n't use such words or ask pardon if they do . "
72091	72098	72100	72102	my Lord Viscount	1859	" I 'm a country gentleman , "
72104	72112	72116	72116	Mohun	676	" I see it by your manner , "
72118	72128	72116	72116	Mohun	676	" No man shall say damned awkward to me . "
72129	72141	72143	72144	the other	1781	" I fling the words in your face , my lord , "
72154	72155	72143	72144	the other	1781	" "
72164	72197	72161	72162	the servants	1845	" cry out Colonel Westbury and my Lord Warwick in a breath . The drawers go out of the room hastily . They tell the people below of the quarrel up stairs . "
72203	72208	72161	72162	the servants	1845	" says Colonel Westbury . "
72218	72219	72210	72211	your lordships	4733	" "
72228	72235	72225	72225	his	1504	" asks the Earl of Warwick . "
72243	72248	72238	72238	Castlewood	676	" says Colonel Westbury . "
72271	72272	72238	72238	Castlewood	676	" "
72276	72287	72238	72238	Castlewood	676	" says my Lord Castlewood , putting on his hat . "
72297	72298	72238	72238	Castlewood	676	" "
72320	72326	72300	72301	my Lord	1352	" says my Lord Mohun . "
72337	72338	72300	72301	my Lord	1352	" "
72355	72372	72340	72341	your lordship	11873	" says Colonel Westbury , with a low bow to my Lord of Warwick and Holland . "
72380	72390	72378	72378	me	0	" says my lord , with a profound congee , "
72405	72406	72395	72403	a gentleman who has been at Mons and Namur	4740	" "
72418	72423	72411	72411	me	0	" says the Captain . "
72437	72443	72411	72411	me	0	" says Harry 's patron . "
72451	72579	72448	72449	Captain Macartney	705	" and he shook Harry 's hand for the last time , save one , in his life . At the bar of the tavern all the gentlemen stopped , and my Lord Viscount said , laughing , to the barwoman , that those cards set people sadly a - quarrelling ; but that the dispute was over now , and the parties were all going away to my Lord Mohun 's house , in Bow Street , to drink a bottle more before going to bed . A half - dozen of chairs were now called , and the six gentlemen stepping into them , the word was privately given to the chairmen to go to Leicester Field , where the gentlemen were set down opposite the "
72583	72819	72448	72449	Captain Macartney	705	" It was midnight , and the town was abed by this time , and only a few lights in the windows of the houses ; but the night was bright enough for the unhappy purpose which the disputants came about ; and so all six entered into that fatal square , the chairmen standing without the railing and keeping the gate , lest any persons should disturb the meeting . All that happened there hath been matter of public notoriety , and is recorded , for warning to lawless men , in the annals of our country . After being engaged for not more than a couple of minutes , as Harry Esmond thought though being occupied at the time with his own adversary 's point , which was active , he may not have taken a good note of time , a cry from the chairmen without , who were smoking their pipes , and leaning over the railings of the field as they watched the dim combat within , announced that some catastrophe had happened , which caused Esmond to drop his sword and look round , at which moment his enemy wounded him in the right hand . But the young man did not heed this hurt much , and ran up to the place where he saw his dear master was down . My Lord Mohun was standing over him . "
72827	72835	72821	72821	you	4744	" he asked in a hollow voice . "
72844	72852	72836	72836	I	0	" my lord said from the ground . "
72860	72865	72836	72836	I	0	" says the other ; "
72918	72919	72902	72902	I	0	" "
72922	72938	72902	72902	I	0	" says my poor Lord Viscount , lifting himself on his elbow and speaking faintly . "
72988	73245	72971	72971	thou	4750	" And here my dear lord felt in his breast for a locket he wore there , and , in the act , fell back fainting . We were all at this terrified , thinking him dead ; but Esmond and Colonel Westbury bade the chairmen come into the field ; and so my lord was carried to one Mr. Aimes , a surgeon , in Long Acre , who kept a bath , and there the house was wakened up , and the victim of this quarrel carried in . My Lord Viscount was put to bed , and his wound looked to by the surgeon , who seemed both kind and skilful . When he had looked to my lord , he bandaged up Harry Esmond 's hand who , from loss of blood , had fainted too , in the house , and may have been some time unconscious ; and when the young man came to himself , you may be sure he eagerly asked what news there were of his dear patron ; on which the surgeon carried him to the room where the Lord Castlewood lay ; who had already sent for a priest ; and desired earnestly , they said , to speak with his kinsman . He was lying on a bed , very pale and ghastly , with that fixed , fatal look in his eyes , which betokens death ; and faintly beckoning all the other persons away from him with his hand , and crying out "
73250	73272	73247	73248	Harry Esmond	427	" the hand fell powerless down on the coverlet , as Harry came forward , and knelt down and kissed it . "
73282	73301	73280	73280	Harry	427	" my Lord Viscount gasped out , with a faint smile , and pressure of his cold hand . "
73317	73714	73715	73715	He	4756	" And with sacred Death waiting , as it were , at the bed - foot , as an awful witness of his words , the poor dying soul gasped out his last wishes in respect of his family ; his humble profession of contrition for his faults ; and his charity towards the world he was leaving . Some things he said concerned Harry Esmond as much as they astonished him . And my Lord Viscount , sinking visibly , was in the midst of these strange confessions , when the ecclesiastic for whom my lord had sent , Mr. Atterbury , arrived . This gentleman had reached to no great church dignity as yet , but was only preacher at St. Bride 's , drawing all the town thither by his eloquent sermons . He was godson to my lord , who had been pupil to his father ; had paid a visit to Castlewood from Oxford more than once ; and it was by his advice , I think , that Harry Esmond was sent to Cambridge , rather than to Oxford , of which place Mr. Atterbury , though a distinguished member , spoke but ill . Our messenger found the good priest already at his books at five o'clock in the morning , and he followed the man eagerly to the house where my poor Lord Viscount lay Esmond watching him , and taking his dying words from his mouth . My lord , hearing of Mr. Atterbury 's arrival , and squeezing Esmond 's hand , asked to be alone with the priest ; and Esmond left them there for this solemn interview . You may be sure that his own prayers and grief accompanied that dying benefactor . My lord had said to him that which confounded the young man informed him of a secret which greatly concerned him . Indeed , after hearing it , he had had good cause for doubt and dismay ; for mental anguish as well as resolution . While the colloquy between Mr. Atterbury and his dying penitent took place within , an immense contest of perplexity was agitating Lord Castlewood 's young companion . At the end of an hour it may be more Mr. Atterbury came out of the room , looking very hard at Esmond , and holding a paper . "
73726	73731	73732	73732	He	4756	" the priest whispered . "
73765	73766	73759	73760	a witness	4758	" "
73770	73777	73767	73767	God	527	" sobbed out the young man , "
73790	73812	73778	73780	my dearest lord	4759	" The priest put the paper into Esmond 's hand . He looked at it . It swam before his eyes . "
73818	73822	73778	73780	my dearest lord	4759	" he said . "
73829	73968	73826	73826	you	0	" said Mr. Atterbury . There was a fire in the room where the cloths were drying for the baths , and there lay a heap in a corner saturated with the blood of my dear lord 's body . Esmond went to the fire , and threw the paper into it . ' Twas a great chimney with glazed Dutch tiles . How we remember such trifles at such awful moments ! the scrap of the book that we have read in a great grief the taste of that last dish that we have eaten before a duel , or some such supreme meeting or parting . On the Dutch tiles at the Bagnio was a rude picture representing Jacob in hairy gloves , cheating Isaac of Esau 's birthright . The burning paper lighted it up . "
73978	74056	73975	73976	Mr. Atterbury	712	" said the young man . He leaned his head against the mantel - piece : a burst of tears came to his eyes . They were the first he had shed as he sat by his lord , scared by this calamity , and more yet by what the poor dying gentleman had told him , and shocked to think that he should be the agent of bringing this double misfortune on those he loved best . "
74063	74150	73975	73976	Mr. Atterbury	712	" said Mr. Esmond . And accordingly they went into the next chamber , where by this time , the dawn had broke , which showed my lord 's poor pale face and wild appealing eyes , that wore that awful fatal look of coming dissolution . The surgeon was with him . He went into the chamber as Atterbury came out thence . My Lord Viscount turned round his sick eyes towards Esmond . It choked the other to hear that rattle in his throat . "
74155	74160	74153	74153	Viscount	440	" says Mr. Atterbury , "
74173	74174	74168	74168	hath	427	" "
74179	74210	74175	74175	My	0	" Esmond said , kneeling down , and taking his hand and kissing it . My Lord Viscount sprang up in his bed , and flung his arms round Esmond . "
74214	74260	74153	74153	Viscount	440	" was all he said . The blood rushed from his mouth , deluging the young man . My dearest lord was no more . He was gone with a blessing on his lips , and love and repentance and kindness in his manly heart . "
74264	74282	74153	74153	Viscount	440	" says Mr. Atterbury , and the young man , kneeling at the bedside , groaned out an "
74285	74286	74153	74153	Viscount	440	" "
74295	74384	74153	74153	Viscount	440	" was Mr. Esmond 's next thought . And on this he besought Mr. Atterbury to bear the tidings to Castlewood . He could not face his mistress himself with those dreadful news . Mr. Atterbury complying kindly , Esmond writ a hasty note on his table - book to my lord 's man , bidding him get the horses for Mr. Atterbury , and ride with him , and send Esmond 's own valise to the Gatehouse prison , whither he resolved to go and give himself up .
74742	74752	74754	74754	he	427	" When I was denied by my own blood , "
74756	74801	74754	74754	he	427	" these dearest friends received and cherished me . When I was a nameless orphan myself , and needed a protector , I found one in yonder kind soul , who has gone to his account repenting of the innocent wrong he has done . "
75112	75119	75120	75120	she	4786	" And this , Mr. Esmond , "
75123	75140	75120	75120	she	4786	" is where I see you ; and ' tis to this you have brought me ! "
75141	75154	75156	75156	he	717	" You have come to console me in my calamity , madam , "
75214	75220	75221	75221	he	717	" Not to reproach me , "
75227	75236	75221	75221	he	717	" My grief is sufficient as it is . "
75237	75249	75250	75250	she	4786	" Take back your hand do not touch me with it ! "
75253	75262	75250	75250	she	4786	" Look ! there 's blood on it ! "
75263	75272	75274	75274	Esmond	427	" I wish they had taken it all , "
75276	75284	75274	75274	Esmond	427	" if you are unkind to me . "
75285	75291	75292	75292	she	4786	" Where is my husband ? "
75296	75750	75250	75250	she	4786	" Give me back my husband , Henry . Why did you stand by at midnight and see him murdered ? Why did the traitor escape who did it ? You , the champion of your house , who offered to die for us ! You that he loved and trusted , and to whom I confided him you that vowed devotion and gratitude , and I believed you yes , I believed you why are you here , and my noble Francis gone ? Why did you come among us ? You have only brought us grief and sorrow ; and repentance , bitter , bitter repentance , as a return for our love and kindness . Did I ever do you a wrong , Henry ? You were but an orphan child when I first saw you when HE first saw you , who was so good , and noble , and trusting . He would have had you sent away , but , like a foolish woman , I besought him to let you stay . And you pretended to love us , and we believed you and you made our house wretched , and my husband 's heart went from me : and I lost him through you I lost him the husband of my youth , I say . I worshipped him : you know I worshipped him and he was changed to me . He was no more my Francis of old my dear , dear soldier . He loved me before he saw you ; and I loved him . Oh , God is my witness how I loved him ! Why did he not send you from among us ? ' Twas only his kindness , that could refuse me nothing then . And , young as you were yes , and weak and alone there was evil , I knew there was evil in keeping you . I read it in your face and eyes . I saw that they boded harm to us and it came , I knew it would . Why did you not die when you had the small - pox and I came myself and watched you , and you did n't know me in your delirium and you called out for me , though I was there at your side ? All that has happened since , was a just judgment on my wicked heart my wicked jealous heart . Oh , I am punished awfully punished ! My husband lies in his blood murdered for defending me , my kind , kind , generous lord and you were by , and you let him die , Henry ! "
75993	76004	76005	76005	he	427	" I wish I were in my lord 's place , "
76009	76055	76005	76005	he	427	" It was not my fault that I was not there , madam . But Fate is stronger than all of us , and willed what has come to pass . It had been better for me to have died when I had the illness . "
76056	76061	76063	76063	she	2819	" Yes , Henry , "
76149	76163	76137	76137	He	427	" Suppose I were to end now , who would grieve for me ? "
76404	76424	76425	76426	the keeper	4828	" The lady had bound it round his arm when he fainted , and before she called for help , "
76431	76544	76425	76426	the keeper	4828	" Poor lady ! she took on sadly about her husband . He has been buried to - day , and a many of the coaches of the nobility went with him my Lord Marlborough 's and my Lord Sunderland 's , and many of the officers of the Guards , in which he served in the old King 's time ; and my lady has been with her two children to the King at Kensington , and asked for justice against my Lord Mohun , who is in hiding , and my Lord the Earl of Warwick and Holland , who is ready to give himself up and take his trial . "
76725	76733	76734	76734	he	427	" It has cost thee grief enough , "
76737	76832	76734	76734	he	427	" dear lady , so loving and so tender . Shall I take it from thee and thy children ? No , never ! Keep it , and wear it , my little Frank , my pretty boy . If I can not make a name for myself , I can die without one . Some day , when my dear mistress sees my heart , I shall be righted ; or if not here or now , why , elsewhere ; where Honor doth not follow us , but where Love reigns perpetual . "
77977	77993	77994	77995	Mr. Esmond	427	" And if we meet no more , or only as strangers in this world , "
77998	78041	77994	77995	Mr. Esmond	427	" a sentence against the cruelty and injustice of which I disdain to appeal ; hereafter she will know who was faithful to her , and whether she had any cause to suspect the love and devotion of her kinsman and servant . "
79248	79299	79300	79300	Dick	578	" Ho , young Killjoy ! here 's a friend come to see thee ; he 'll pray with thee , or he 'll drink with thee ; or he 'll drink and pray turn about . Dick , my Christian hero , here 's the little scholar of Castlewood . "
79326	79417	79319	79319	his	578	" What ! is this the little man that used to talk Latin and fetch our bowls ? How tall thou art grown ! I protest I should have known thee anywhere . And so you have turned ruffian and fighter ; and wanted to measure swords with Mohun , did you ? I protest that Mohun said at the Guard dinner yesterday , where there was a pretty company of us , that the young fellow wanted to fight him , and was the better man of the two . "
79418	79432	79434	79434	Esmond	427	" I wish we could have tried and proved it , Mr. Steele , "
79579	79582	79584	79584	Westbury	709	" Faith , "
79586	79637	79584	79584	Westbury	709	" the little scholar was the first to begin the quarrel I mind me of it now at Lockit 's . I always hated that fellow Mohun . What was the real cause , of the quarrel betwixt him and poor Frank ? I would wager ' twas a woman . "
79638	79652	79653	79653	Harry	427	" ' Twas a quarrel about play on my word , about play , "
79656	79706	79708	79709	Mr. Esmond	427	" My poor lord lost great sums to his guest at Castlewood . Angry words passed between them ; and , though Lord Castlewood was the kindest and most pliable soul alive , his spirit was very high ; and hence that meeting which has brought us all here , "
79729	79742	79744	79744	Westbury	709	" I do not like to use bad words of a nobleman , "
79746	79865	79744	79744	Westbury	709	" but if my Lord Mohun were a commoner , I would say , ' twas a pity he was not hanged . He was familiar with dice and women at a time other boys are at school being birched ; he was as wicked as the oldest rake , years ere he had done growing ; and handled a sword and a foil , and a bloody one , too , before he ever used a razor . He held poor Will Mountford in talk that night , when bloody Dick Hill ran him through . He will come to a bad end , will that young lord ; and no end is bad enough for him , "
80573	80579	80580	80580	he	559	" I would as lief , "
80583	80614	80580	80580	he	559	" have pleaded guilty to the murder , and have suffered for it like any other felon , as have to endure the torture to which my mistress subjects me . "
80780	80792	80794	80795	Mr. Steele	559	" And I think I spoke well , my poor boy , "
80797	81095	80794	80795	Mr. Steele	559	" for who would not speak well in such a cause , and before so beautiful a judge ? I did not see the lovely Beatrix sure her famous namesake of Florence was never half so beautiful , only the young Viscount was in the room with the Lord Churchill , my Lord of Marlborough 's eldest son . But these young gentlemen went off to the garden ; I could see them from the window tilting at each other with poles in a mimic tournament grief touches the young but lightly , and I remember that I beat a drum at the coffin of my own father . My Lady Viscountess looked out at the two boys at their game and said ' You see , sir , children are taught to use weapons of death as toys , and to make a sport of murder ; ' and as she spoke she looked so lovely , and stood there in herself so sad and beautiful , an instance of that doctrine whereof I am a humble preacher , that had I not dedicated my little volume of the ' Christian Hero ' I perceive , Harry , thou hast not cut the leaves of it . The sermon is good , believe me , though the preacher 's life may not answer it I say , had n't I dedicated the volume to Lord Cutts , I would have asked permission to place her ladyship 's name on the first page . I think I never saw such a beautiful violet as that of her eyes , Harry . Her complexion is of the pink of the blush - rose , she hath an exquisite turned wrist and dimpled hand , and I make no doubt "
81096	81112	81115	81116	Mr. Esmond	427	" Did you come to tell me about the dimples on my lady 's hand ? "
81120	81133	81135	81150	the poor Captain , who indeed was but too often in a state to see double	5041	" A lovely creature in affliction seems always doubly beautiful to me , "
81164	81171	81155	81155	he	5041	" As I spoke my business , "
81176	81420	81172	81173	Mr. Steele	559	" and narrated to your mistress what all the world knows , and the other side hath been eager to acknowledge that you had tried to put yourself between the two lords , and to take your patron 's quarrel on your own point ; I recounted the general praises of your gallantry , besides my Lord Mohun 's particular testimony to it ; I thought the widow listened with some interest , and her eyes I have never seen such a violet , Harry looked up at mine once or twice . But after I had spoken on this theme for a while she suddenly broke away with a cry of grief . ' I would to God , sir , ' she said , ' I had never heard that word gallantry which you use , or known the meaning of it . My lord might have been here but for that ; my home might be happy ; my poor boy have a father . It was what you gentlemen call gallantry came into my home , and drove my husband on to the cruel sword that killed him . You should not speak the word to a Christian woman , sir , a poor widowed mother of orphans , whose home was happy until the world came into it the wicked godless world , that takes the blood of the innocent , and lets the guilty go free . ' "
81432	81437	81455	81455	she	5042	" Mr. Steele continued , "
81713	81722	81723	81724	Mr. Steele	559	" I then thought to speak for you , "
81727	81785	81723	81724	Mr. Steele	559	" and I interposed by saying , ' There was one , madam , who , at least , would have put his own breast between your husband 's and my Lord Mohun 's sword . Your poor young kinsman , Harry Esmond , hath told me that he tried to draw the quarrel on himself . ' "
81849	81865	81867	81868	Mr. Steele	559	" ' Madam , madam , he is not to blame , ' I interposed , "
81870	82055	81867	81868	Mr. Steele	559	" ' Do I blame him to you , sir ? ' asked the widow . ' If ' tis he who sent you , say that I have taken counsel , where ' she spoke with a very pallid cheek now , and a break in her voice ' where all who ask may have it ; and that it bids me to part from him , and to see him no more . We met in the prison for the last time at least for years to come . It may be , in years hence , when when our knees and our tears and our contrition have changed our sinful hearts , sir , and wrought our pardon , we may meet again but not now . After what has passed , I could not bear to see him . I wish him well , sir ; but I wish him farewell , too ; and if he has that that regard towards us which he speaks of , I beseech him to prove it by obeying me in this . ' "
82074	82079	82057	82057	I	0	" Mr. Steele said . "
82086	82092	82083	82083	her	1381	" continued my kind scholar . "
82234	82272	82274	82274	Beatrix	466	" Here the fair Beatrix entered from the river , with her cheeks flushing with health , and looking only the more lovely and fresh for the mourning habiliments which she wore . And my Lady Viscountess said "
82316	82327	82314	82314	Harry	427	" The sentimental Captain concluded his sad tale , saying , "
82382	82507	82374	82374	her	5094	" The party of prisoners lived very well in Newgate , and with comforts very different to those which were awarded to the poor wretches there his insensibility to their misery , their gayety still more frightful , their curses and blasphemy , hath struck with a kind of shame since as proving how selfish , during his imprisonment , his own particular grief was , and how entirely the thoughts of it absorbed him : if the three gentlemen lived well under the care of the Warden of Newgate , it was because they paid well : and indeed the cost at the dearest ordinary or the grandest tavern in London could not have furnished a longer reckoning , than our host of the "
82510	82813	82814	82815	MONG COUSSIN	735	" as Colonel Westbury called it . Our rooms were the three in the gate over Newgate on the second story looking up Newgate Street towards Cheapside and Paul 's Church . And we had leave to walk on the roof , and could see thence Smithfield and the Bluecoat Boys ' School , Gardens , and the Chartreux , where , as Harry Esmond remembered , Dick the Scholar , and his friend Tom Tusher , had had their schooling . Harry could never have paid his share of that prodigious heavy reckoning which my landlord brought to his guests once a week : for he had but three pieces in his pockets that fatal night before the duel , when the gentlemen were at cards , and offered to play five . But whilst he was yet ill at the Gatehouse , after Lady Castlewood had visited him there , and before his trial , there came one in an orange - tawny coat and blue lace , the livery which the Esmonds always wore , and brought a sealed packet for Mr. Esmond , which contained twenty guineas , and a note saying that a counsel had been appointed for him , and that more money would be forthcoming whenever he needed it . ' Twas a queer letter from the scholar as she was , or as she called herself : the Dowager Viscountess Castlewood , written in the strange barbarous French which she and many other fine ladies of that time witness her Grace of Portsmouth employed . Indeed , spelling was not an article of general commodity in the world then , and my Lord Marlborough 's letters can show that he , for one , had but a little share of this part of grammar : "
82817	82824	82814	82815	MONG COUSSIN	735	" my Lady Viscountess Dowager wrote , "
83048	83085	83026	83026	Helas	5097	" La Veuve se raccommode avec Miladi Marlboro qui est tout puicante avecque la Reine Anne . Cet dam senteraysent pour la petite prude ; qui pourctant a un fi du mesme asge que vous savay . "

83950	83953	83955	83955	he	427	" Marchioness , "
83964	83978	83955	83955	he	427	" is it only the hand I may have the honor of saluting ? "
84296	84301	84276	84276	She	5168	" Welcome , cousin , "
84369	84383	84384	84384	he	427	" Welcome , nephew , at least , madam , it should be , "
84387	84411	84384	84384	he	427	" A great wrong has been done to me and to you , and to my poor mother , who is no more . "
84412	84424	84425	84425	she	5168	" I declare before heaven that I was guiltless of it , "
84436	84443	84425	84425	she	5168	" It was your wicked father who "
84444	84453	84455	84456	Mr. Esmond	427	" Who brought this dishonor on our family , "
84458	84523	84455	84456	Mr. Esmond	427	" I know it full well . I want to disturb no one . Those who are in present possession have been my dearest benefactors , and are quite innocent of intentional wrong to me . The late lord , my dear patron , knew not the truth until a few months before his death , when Father Holt brought the news to him . "
84524	84540	84543	84545	the Dowager Lady	494	" The wretch ! he had it in confession ! he had it in confession ! "
84547	84561	84543	84545	the Dowager Lady	494	" Not so . He learned it elsewhere as well as in confession , "
84566	84765	84562	84563	Mr. Esmond	427	" My father , when wounded at the Boyne , told the truth to a French priest , who was in hiding after the battle , as well as to the priest there , at whose house he died . This gentleman did not think fit to divulge the story till he met with Mr. Holt at Saint Omer 's . And the latter kept it back for his own purpose , and until he had learned whether my mother was alive or no . She is dead years since , my poor patron told me with his dying breath , and I doubt him not . I do not know even whether I could prove a marriage . I would not if I could . I do not care to bring shame on our name , or grief upon those whom I love , however hardly they may use me . My father 's son , madam , wo n't aggravate the wrong my father did you . Continue to be his widow , and give me your kindness . ' Tis all I ask from you ; and I shall never speak of this matter again . "
84766	84775	84778	84779	my lady	11267	" Mais vous etes un noble jeune homme ! "
84797	84801	84803	84804	Mr. Esmond	427	" Noblesse oblige , "
84812	84865	84803	84804	Mr. Esmond	427	" There are those alive to whom , in return for their love to me , I often fondly said I would give my life away . Shall I be their enemy now , and quarrel about a title ? What matters who has it ? ' Tis with the family still . "
84866	84886	84889	84891	my Lady Dowager	3645	" What can there be in that little prude of a woman that makes men so raffoler about her ? "
84893	85207	85208	85209	Mr. Esmond	427	" She was here for a month petitioning the King . She is pretty , and well conserved ; but she has not the bel air . In his late Majesty 's Court all the men pretended to admire her , and she was no better than a little wax doll . She is better now , and looks the sister of her daughter ; but what mean you all by bepraising her ? Mr. Steele , who was in waiting on Prince George , seeing her with her two children going to Kensington , writ a poem about her , and says he shall wear her colors , and dress in black for the future . Mr. Congreve says he will write a ' Mourning Widow , ' that shall be better than his ' Mourning Bride . ' Though their husbands quarrelled and fought when that wretch Churchill deserted the King for which he deserved to be hung , Lady Marlborough has again gone wild about the little widow ; insulted me in my own drawing - room , by saying ' twas not the OLD widow , but the young Viscountess , she had come to see . Little Castlewood and little Lord Churchill are to be sworn friends , and have boxed each other twice or thrice like brothers already . ' Twas that wicked young Mohun who , coming back from the provinces last year , where he had disinterred her , raved about her all the winter ; said she was a pearl set before swine ; and killed poor stupid Frank . The quarrel was all about his wife . I know ' twas all about her . Was there anything between her and Mohun , nephew ? Tell me now was there anything ? About yourself , I do not ask you to answer questions . "
85213	85229	85230	85230	he	427	" My lady 's virtue is like that of a saint in heaven , madam , "
85234	85272	85230	85230	he	427	" Eh ! mon neveu . Many saints get to heaven after having a deal to repent of . I believe you are like all the rest of the fools , and madly in love with her . "
85273	85286	85287	85287	Esmond	427	" Indeed , I loved and honored her before all the world , "
85290	85298	85287	85287	Esmond	427	" I take no shame in that . "
85299	85567	85230	85230	he	427	" And she has shut her door on you given the living to that horrid young cub , son of that horrid old bear , Tusher , and says she will never see you more . Monsieur mon neveu we are all like that . When I was a young woman , I 'm positive that a thousand duels were fought about me . And when poor Monsieur de Souchy drowned himself in the canal at Bruges because I danced with Count Springbock , I could n't squeeze out a single tear , but danced till five o'clock the next morning . ' Twas the Count no , ' twas my Lord Ormond that played the fiddles , and his Majesty did me the honor of dancing all night with me . How you are grown ! You have got the bel air . You are a black man . Our Esmonds are all black . The little prude 's son is fair ; so was his father fair and stupid . You were an ugly little wretch when you came to Castlewood you were all eyes , like a young crow . We intended you should be a priest . That awful Father Holt how he used to frighten me when I was ill ! I have a comfortable director now the Abbe Douillette a dear man . We make meagre on Fridays always . My cook is a devout pious man . You , of course , are of the right way of thinking . They say the Prince of Orange is very ill indeed . "
87383	87429	87431	87432	the Dowager	3074	" The Princess is but a puppet in the hands of that fury of a woman , who comes into my drawing - room and insults me to my face . What can come to a country that is given over to such a woman ? "
87434	87493	87431	87432	the Dowager	3074	" As for that double - faced traitor , my Lord Marlborough , he has betrayed every man and every woman with whom he has had to deal , except his horrid wife , who makes him tremble . ' Tis all over with the country when it has got into the clutches of such wretches as these . "
88414	88427	88404	88406	the Irish soldiers	5359	" Change kings with us and we will fight it over again . "
88995	89005	89006	89008	the poor lord	5396	" And would to God I had done it , "

89093	89100	89102	89104	my poor lord	12705	" I had a sore temptation , "
89106	89283	89102	89104	my poor lord	12705	" Since I had come into this cursed title of Castlewood , which hath never prospered with me , I have spent far more than the income of that estate , and my paternal one , too . I calculated all my means down to the last shilling , and found I never could pay you back , my poor Harry , whose fortune I had had for twelve years . My wife and children must have gone out of the house dishonored , and beggars . God knows , it hath been a miserable one for me and mine . Like a coward , I clung to that respite which Holt gave me . I kept the truth from Rachel and you . I tried to win money of Mohun , and only plunged deeper into debt ; I scarce dared look thee in the face when I saw thee . This sword hath been hanging over my head these two years . I swear I felt happy when Mohun 's blade entered my side . "

94280	94313	94268	94269	Mr. Esmond	427	" Yes Tusher , my maid 's son ; and who has got all the qualities of his father the lackey in black , and his accomplished mamma the waiting - woman , "
94318	94427	94428	94429	My lady	11267	" What do you suppose that a sentimental widow , who will live down in that dingy dungeon of a Castlewood , where she spoils her boy , kills the poor with her drugs , has prayers twice a day and sees nobody but the chaplain what do you suppose she can do , mon Cousin , but let the horrid parson , with his great square toes and hideous little green eyes , make love to her ? Cela c'est vu , mon Cousin . When I was a girl at Castlewood , all the chaplains fell in love with me they 've nothing else to do . "

96311	96347	96308	96308	he	798	" are you come back ? Have you been to the wars ? You 'll take me with you when you go again ? Why did n't you write to us ? Come to mother . "
96356	96364	96308	96308	he	798	" God bless you , my boy , "
96427	96441	96442	96443	Lady Esmond	598	" It was kind of you to come back to us , Henry , "
96446	96453	96442	96443	Lady Esmond	598	" I thought you might come . "
96454	96472	96473	96473	Frank	454	" We read of the fleet coming to Portsmouth . Why did you not come from Portsmouth ? "
96537	96552	96553	96553	he	427	" You had but to ask , and you know I would be here , "
96841	96846	96848	96848	Frank	454	" Here comes Squaretoes , "

96929	96938	96940	96940	he	427	" I am charmed to see Captain Esmond , "
96942	97005	96940	96940	he	427	" My lord and I have read the Reddas incolumem precor , and applied it , I am sure , to you . You come back with Gaditanian laurels ; when I heard you were bound thither , I wished , I am sure , I was another Septimius . My Lord Viscount , your lordship remembers Septimi , Gades aditure mecum ? "
97006	97022	97024	97025	Mr. Esmond	427	" There 's an angle of earth that I love better than Gades , Tusher , "
97027	97047	97024	97025	Mr. Esmond	427	" ' Tis that one where your reverence hath a parsonage , and where our youth was brought up . "
97048	97060	97062	97063	Mr. Tusher	521	" A house that has so many sacred recollections to me , "
97076	97116	97024	97025	Mr. Esmond	427	" a house near to that of my respected patron , my most honored patroness , must ever be a dear abode to me . But , madam , the verger waits to close the gates on your ladyship . "
97117	97130	97132	97133	my lord	1352	" And Harry 's coming home to supper . Huzzay ! huzzay ! "
97135	97167	97132	97133	my lord	1352	" Mother , I shall run home and bid Beatrix put her ribbons on . Beatrix is a maid of honor , Harry . Such a fine set - up minx ! "
97168	97179	97180	97181	the widow	5037	" Your heart was never in the Church , Harry , "
97217	97289	97185	97185	her	5037	" I always thought you had no vocation that way ; and that ' twas a pity to shut you out from the world . You would but have pined and chafed at Castlewood : and ' tis better you should make a name for yourself . I often said so to my dear lord . How he loved you ! ' Twas my lord that made you stay with us . "
97290	97302	97304	97305	Mr. Esmond	427	" I asked no better than to stay near you always , "
97307	97546	97547	97547	Esmond	454	" But to go was best , Harry . When the world can not give peace , you will know where to find it ; but one of your strong imagination and eager desires must try the world first before he tires of it . ' Twas not to be thought of , or if it once was , it was only by my selfishness , that you should remain as chaplain to a country gentleman and tutor to a little boy . You are of the blood of the Esmonds , kinsman ; and that was always wild in youth . Look at Francis . He is but fifteen , and I scarce can keep him in my nest . His talk is all of war and pleasure , and he longs to serve in the next campaign . Perhaps he and the young Lord Churchill shall go the next . Lord Marlborough has been good to us . You know how kind they were in my misfortune . And so was your your father 's widow . No one knows how good the world is , till grief comes to try us . ' Tis through my Lady Marlborough 's goodness that Beatrix hath her place at Court ; and Frank is under my Lord Chamberlain . And the dowager lady , your father 's widow , has promised to provide for you has she not ? "
97550	97574	97575	97575	he	5852	" Yes . As far as present favor went , Lady Castlewood was very good to him . And should her mind change , "
97579	97655	97575	97575	he	5852	" as ladies ' minds will , I am strong enough to bear my own burden , and make my way somehow . Not by the sword very likely . Thousands have a better genius for that than I , but there are many ways in which a young man of good parts and education can get on in the world ; and I am pretty sure , one way or other , of promotion ! "
97709	97719	97720	97720	she	11365	" And now we are drawing near to home , "
97723	97828	97720	97720	she	11365	" I knew you would come , Harry , if if it was but to forgive me for having spoken unjustly to you after that horrid horrid misfortune . I was half frantic with grief then when I saw you . And I know now they have told me . That wretch , whose name I can never mention , even has said it : how you tried to avert the quarrel , and would have taken it on yourself , my poor child : but it was God 's will that I should be punished , and that my dear lord should fall . "
97829	97841	97842	97842	Esmond	427	" He gave me his blessing on his death - bed , "
97845	97852	97842	97842	Esmond	427	" Thank God for that legacy ! "
97853	97861	97863	97864	the lady	1381	" Amen , amen ! dear Henry , "
97870	97909	97863	97864	the lady	1381	" I knew it . Mr. Atterbury , of St. Bride 's , who was called to him , told me so . And I thanked God , too , and in my prayers ever since remembered it . "
97910	97926	97927	97928	Mr. Esmond	427	" You had spared me many a bitter night , had you told me sooner , "
97931	97940	97941	97941	she	1381	" I know it , I know it , "
97966	98164	97941	97941	she	1381	" I know how wicked my heart has been ; and I have suffered too , my dear . I confessed to Mr. Atterbury I must not tell any more . He I said I would not write to you or go to you and it was better even that having parted , we should part . But I knew you would come back I own that . That is no one 's fault . And to - day , Henry , in the anthem , when they sang it , ' When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion , we were like them that dream , ' I thought , yes , like them that dream them that dream . And then it went , ' They that sow in tears shall reap in joy ; and he that goeth forth and weepeth , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him ; ' I looked up from the book , and saw you . I was not surprised when I saw you . I knew you would come , my dear , and saw the gold sunshine round your head . "
98209	98218	98219	98219	she	5859	" Do you know what day it is ? "
98222	98290	98219	98219	she	5859	" It is the 29th of December it is your birthday ! But last year we did not drink it no , no . My lord was cold , and my Harry was likely to die : and my brain was in a fever ; and we had no wine . But now now you are come again , bringing your sheaves with you , my dear . "
98318	98329	98303	98303	she	5859	" bringing your sheaves with you your sheaves with you ! "
98557	98567	98568	98569	Mr. Esmond	427	" If if ' tis so , dear lady , "
98572	98703	98568	98569	Mr. Esmond	427	" why should I ever leave you ? If God hath given me this great boon and near or far from me , as I know now , the heart of my dearest mistress follows me , let me have that blessing near me , nor ever part with it till death separate us . Come away leave this Europe , this place which has so many sad recollections for you . Begin a new life in a new world . My good lord often talked of visiting that land in Virginia which King Charles gave us gave his ancestor . Frank will give us that . No man there will ask if there is a blot on my name , or inquire in the woods what my title is . "
98704	98718	98719	98719	she	5865	" And my children and my duty and my good father , Henry ? "
98723	98842	98719	98719	she	5865	" He has none but me now ! for soon my sister will leave him , and the old man will be alone . He has conformed since the new Queen 's reign ; and here in Winchester , where they love him , they have found a church for him . When the children leave me , I will stay with him . I can not follow them into the great world , where their way lies it scares me . They will come and visit me ; and you will , sometimes , Henry yes , sometimes , as now , in the Holy Advent season , when I have seen and blessed you once more . "
98843	98852	98854	98855	Mr. Esmond	427	" I would leave all to follow you , "
98857	98871	98854	98855	Mr. Esmond	427	" and can you not be as generous for me , dear lady ? "
98872	98877	98878	98878	she	5866	" Hush , boy ! "
98897	99031	98894	98894	she	5866	" The world is beginning for you . For me , I have been so weak and sinful that I must leave it , and pray out an expiation , dear Henry . Had we houses of religion as there were once , and many divines of our Church would have them again , I often think I would retire to one and pass my life in penance . But I would love you still yes , there is no sin in such a love as mine now ; and my dear lord in heaven may see my heart ; and knows the tears that have washed my sin away and now now my duty is here , by my children whilst they need me , and by my poor old father , and "
99032	99038	99039	99039	Henry	427	" And not by me ? "
99042	99045	99046	99046	she	5868	" Hush ! "
99059	99285	99046	99046	she	5868	" I have been your nurse . You could not see me , Harry , when you were in the small - pox , and I came and sat by you . Ah ! I prayed that I might die , but it would have been in sin , Henry . Oh , it is horrid to look back to that time . It is over now and past , and it has been forgiven me . When you need me again , I will come ever so far . When your heart is wounded , then come to me , my dear . Be silent ! let me say all . You never loved me , dear Henry no , you do not now , and I thank heaven for it . I used to watch you , and knew by a thousand signs that it was so . Do you remember how glad you were to go away to college ? ' Twas I sent you . I told my papa that , and Mr. Atterbury too , when I spoke to him in London . And they both gave me absolution both and they are godly men , having authority to bind and to loose . And they forgave me , as my dear lord forgave me before he went to heaven . "
99286	99297	99298	99299	Mr. Esmond	427	" I think the angels are not all in heaven , "
99455	99458	99461	99461	she	2985	" Welcome , "
99533	99538	99544	99544	her	2985	" Welcome , Harry ! "
99546	99568	99544	99544	her	2985	" Here , we are all come to say so . Here 's old Pincot , has n't she grown handsome ? "
99599	99605	99590	99590	she	2985	" Have done , now . "
99606	99665	99666	99666	he	427	" And here 's Jack Lockwood . He 'll make a famous grenadier , Jack ; and so shall I ; we 'll both ' list under you , Cousin . As soon as I 'm seventeen , I go to the army every gentleman goes to the army . Look ! who comes here ho , ho ! "
99672	99702	99666	99666	he	427	" ' Tis Mistress Trix , with a new ribbon ; I knew she would put one on as soon as she heard a captain was coming to supper . "
100117	100129	100131	100132	my lord	1352	" She hath put on her scarlet stockings and white shoes , "
100137	100156	100157	100157	She	5893	" Oh , my fine mistress ! is this the way you set your cap at the Captain ? "
100200	100203	100204	100204	she	5893	" Stop , "
100207	100219	100204	100204	she	5893	" I am grown too big ! Welcome , cousin Harry , "
100278	100284	100286	100287	my lady	11267	" N'est - ce pas ? "
100334	100377	100379	100380	my lord	1352	" Right foot forward , toe turned out , so : now drop the curtsy , and show the red stockings , Trix . They 've silver clocks , Harry . The Dowager sent 'em . She went to put 'em on , "
100382	100389	100391	100391	Miss	5916	" Hush , you stupid child ! "
100450	100465	100430	100430	she	5916	" Oh , Harry , we 're so , SO glad you 're come ! "
100466	100473	100430	100430	she	5916	" There are woodcocks for supper , "
100478	100488	100430	100430	she	5916	" Huzzay ! It was such a hungry sermon . "
100489	100505	100430	100430	she	5916	" And it is the 29th of December ; and our Harry has come home . "
100506	100512	100515	100516	my lord	1352	" Huzzay , old Pincot ! "
100755	100763	100764	100764	he	427	" This might have been my life , "
100768	100813	100764	100764	he	427	" this might have been my duty from now till old age . Well , were it not a pleasant one to be with these dear friends and part from 'em no more ? Until until the destined lover comes and takes away pretty Beatrix "
100956	100963	100965	100966	my lady	11267	" I am an old woman , "
100973	100989	100965	100966	my lady	11267	" I can not hope to look as young as you do , my dear . "
100990	101009	101011	101012	my lord	1352	" She 'll never look as good as you do if she lives till she 's a hundred , "
101026	101035	101037	101037	Beatrix	466	" Do I look very wicked , cousin ? "
101085	101094	101096	101096	he	1352	" I 'm like your looking - glass , "
101098	101106	101096	101096	he	1352	" and that ca n't flatter you . "
101107	101121	101123	101124	her mother	11361	" He means that you are always looking at him , my dear , "
101156	101166	101172	101172	her	11267	" And Harry is very good to look at , "
101180	101191	101193	101193	he	1523	" If ' tis good to see a happy face , "
101195	101200	101193	101193	he	1523	" you see that . "
101205	101208	101201	101202	My lady	11267	" Amen , "
101246	101266	101233	101233	her	11267	" Why , Harry , how fine we look in our scarlet and silver , and our black periwig , "
101271	101298	101233	101233	her	11267	" Mother , I am tired of my own hair . When shall I have a peruke ? Where did you get your steenkirk , Harry ? "
101299	101310	101312	101312	Harry	427	" It 's some of my Lady Dowager 's lace , "
101327	101328	101315	101315	she	11267	" "
101339	101344	101330	101331	Lady Dowager	5948	" my lord continued . "
101356	101368	101345	101345	She	5948	" says Miss Beatrix . Her brother broke into a laugh . "
101386	101391	101383	101383	I	0	" he cries out . "
101408	101413	101396	101396	you	0	" says Miss Beatrix . "
101430	101436	101428	101428	mother	3961	" said the young lord . "
101475	101476	101470	101470	Pincot	804	" "
101484	101489	101490	101490	I	0	" asked Mistress Beatrix . "
101495	101501	101493	101493	Harry	427	" my lord goes on , "
101575	101576	101580	101580	you	427	" "
101590	101595	101596	101596	I	0	" asks my lady . "
101602	101606	101596	101596	I	0	" says Beatrix . "
101693	101798	101668	101668	he	5962	" Harry thought if he had wanted a subject for verses yesterday , to - day he had found one : and not all the Lindamiras and Ardelias of the poets were half so beautiful as this young creature ; but he did not say so , though some one did for him . This was his dear lady , who , after the meal was over , and the young people were gone , began talking of her children with Mr. Esmond , and of the characters of one and the other , and of her hopes and fears for both of them . "
101808	101812	101668	101668	he	5962	" she said , "
101915	101916	101903	101903	she	5974	" "
101929	101933	101919	101923	not a princess in Europe	5978	" says Esmond . "
101942	101947	101948	101948	She	5974	" answered my lady . "
102041	102051	102037	102037	you	5980	" The gentleman could only blush for a reply . "
102092	103139	102061	102061	her	466	" And , looking at him keenly with hers , the fair widow left him . And so it is a pair of bright eyes with a dozen glances suffice to subdue a man ; to enslave him , and inflame him ; to make him even forget ; they dazzle him so that the past becomes straightway dim to him ; and he so prizes them that he would give all his life to possess 'em . What is the fond love of dearest friends compared to this treasure ? Is memory as strong as expectancy ? fruition , as hunger ? gratitude , as desire ? I have looked at royal diamonds in the jewel - rooms in Europe , and thought how wars have been made about 'em ; Mogul sovereigns deposed and strangled for them , or ransomed with them ; millions expended to buy them ; and daring lives lost in digging out the little shining toys that I value no more than the button in my hat . And so there are other glittering baubles of rare water too for which men have been set to kill and quarrel ever since mankind began ; and which last but for a score of years , when their sparkle is over . Where are those jewels now that beamed under Cleopatra 's forehead , or shone in the sockets of Helen ? The second day after Esmond 's coming to Walcote , Tom Tusher had leave to take a holiday , and went off in his very best gown and bands to court the young woman whom his Reverence desired to marry , and who was not a viscount 's widow , as it turned out , but a brewer 's relict at Southampton , with a couple of thousand pounds to her fortune : for honest Tom 's heart was under such excellent control , that Venus herself without a portion would never have caused it to flutter . So he rode away on his heavy - paced gelding to pursue his jog - trot loves , leaving Esmond to the society of his dear mistress and her daughter , and with his young lord for a companion , who was charmed , not only to see an old friend , but to have the tutor and his Latin books put out of the way . The boy talked of things and people , and not a little about himself , in his frank artless way . ' Twas easy to see that he and his sister had the better of their fond mother , for the first place in whose affections , though they fought constantly , and though the kind lady persisted that she loved both equally , ' twas not difficult to understand that Frank was his mother 's darling and favorite . He ruled the whole household always excepting rebellious Beatrix not less now than when he was a child marshalling the village boys in playing at soldiers , and caning them lustily too , like the sturdiest corporal . As for Tom Tusher , his Reverence treated the young lord with that politeness and deference which he always showed for a great man , whatever his age or his stature was . Indeed , with respect to this young one , it was impossible not to love him , so frank and winning were his manners , his beauty , his gayety , the ring of his laughter , and the delightful tone of his voice . Wherever he went , he charmed and domineered . I think his old grandfather the Dean , and the grim old housekeeper , Mrs. Pincot , were as much his slaves as his mother was : and as for Esmond , he found himself presently submitting to a certain fascination the boy had , and slaving it like the rest of the family . The pleasure which he had in Frank 's mere company and converse exceeded that which he ever enjoyed in the society of any other man , however delightful in talk , or famous for wit . His presence brought sunshine into a room , his laugh , his prattle , his noble beauty and brightness of look cheered and charmed indescribably . At the least tale of sorrow , his hands were in his purse , and he was eager with sympathy and bounty . The way in which women loved and petted him , when , a year or two afterwards , he came upon the world , yet a mere boy , and the follies which they did for him as indeed he for them , recalled the career of Rochester , and outdid the successes of Grammont . His very creditors loved him ; and the hardest usurers , and some of the rigid prudes of the other sex too , could deny him nothing . He was no more witty than another man , but what he said , he said and looked as no man else could say or look it . I have seen the women at the comedy at Bruxelles crowd round him in the lobby : and as he sat on the stage more people looked at him than at the actors , and watched him ; and I remember at Ramillies , when he was hit and fell , a great big red - haired Scotch sergeant flung his halbert down , burst out a - crying like a woman , seizing him up as if he had been an infant , and carrying him out of the fire . This brother and sister were the most beautiful couple ever seen ; though after he winged away from the maternal nest this pair were seldom together . Sitting at dinner two days after Esmond 's arrival it was the last day of the year , and so happy a one to Harry Esmond , that to enjoy it was quite worth all the previous pain which he had endured and forgot , my young lord , filling a bumper , and bidding Harry take another , drank to his sister , saluting her under the title of "

103146	103165	103144	103144	Marchioness	539	" says Harry , not without a pang of wonder , for he was curious and jealous already . "
103171	103199	103200	103203	The Marchioness of Blandford	813	" says Beatrix , with a toss of her head . My Lady Viscountess looked up for a moment at Esmond , and cast her eyes down . "
103205	103209	103200	103203	The Marchioness of Blandford	813	" says Frank . "
103221	103237	103238	103238	Blandford	813	" My lord used to call the Dowager of Chelsey by this and other names . "
103270	103271	103264	103265	Dr. Hare	815	" "
103281	103290	103272	103272	I	0	" says Beatrix . My lady only said : "
103308	103309	103293	103293	you	5987	" "
103318	103322	103328	103328	mother	3961	" continues Frank : "
103344	103345	103333	103333	Beatrix	466	" "
103361	103409	103358	103358	their	1862	" says Mistress Beatrix , rising up with the air of a young queen , tossing her rustling flowing draperies about her , and quitting the room , followed by her mother . Lady Castlewood again looked at Esmond , as she stooped down and kissed Frank . "
103419	103423	103358	103358	their	1862	" she said : "
103439	103465	103432	103432	Harry	427	" And she went away , too , in her black robes , looking back on the young man with her fair , fond face . "
103472	103486	103432	103432	Harry	427	" says Frank , sipping his wine with the air of a lord . "
103542	103543	103539	103540	Captain Hawkins	817	" "
103553	103557	103546	103546	I	0	" says Harry . "
103569	103574	103575	103575	I	0	" says my lord . "
103590	103591	103582	103582	thou	6006	" "
103599	103604	103582	103582	thou	6006	" asks the other . "
103935	104178	103919	103919	you	6029	" The elder said he would go in to his mistress 's tea - table . The young lad , with a heightened color and voice , began singing a snatch of a song , and marched out of the room . Esmond heard him presently calling his dogs about him , and cheering and talking to them ; and by a hundred of his looks and gestures , tricks of voice and gait , was reminded of the dead lord , Frank 's father . And so , the sylvester night passed away ; the family parted long before midnight , Lady Castlewood remembering , no doubt , former New Years ' Eves , when healths were drunk , and laughter went round in the company of him , to whom years , past , and present , and future , were to be as one ; and so cared not to sit with her children and hear the Cathedral bells ringing the birth of the year 1703 . Esmond heard the chimes as he sat in his own chamber , ruminating by the blazing fire there , and listened to the last notes of them , looking out from his window towards the city , and the great gray towers of the Cathedral lying under the frosty sky , with the keen stars shining above . The sight of these brilliant orbs no doubt made him think of other luminaries . "
104188	104191	104181	104181	her	6035	" thought Esmond "
104200	104229	104181	104181	her	6035	" Luckily his kinsman was by , and Esmond knew he would have no difficulty in finding out Mistress Beatrix 's history from the simple talk of the boy .
104290	104298	104299	104299	he	3232	" I know my place , Harry , "
104302	104656	104299	104299	he	3232	" I 'm not proud the boys at Winchester College say I 'm proud : but I 'm not proud . I am simply Francis James Viscount Castlewood in the peerage of Ireland . I might have been do you know that ? Francis James Marquis and Earl of Esmond in that of England . The late lord refused the title which was offered to him by my godfather , his late Majesty . You should know that you are of our family , you know you can not help your bar sinister , Harry , my dear fellow ; and you belong to one of the best families in England , in spite of that ; and you stood by my father , and by G ! I 'll stand by you . You shall never want a friend , Harry , while Francis James Viscount Castlewood has a shilling . It 's now 1703 I shall come of age in 1709 . I shall go back to Castlewood ; I shall live at Castlewood ; I shall build up the house . My property will be pretty well restored by then . The late viscount mismanaged my property , and left it in a very bad state . My mother is living close , as you see , and keeps me in a way hardly befitting a peer of these realms ; for I have but a pair of horses , a governor , and a man that is valet and groom . But when I am of age , these things will be set right , Harry . Our house will be as it should be . You will always come to Castlewood , wo n't you ? You shall always have your two rooms in the court kept for you ; and if anybody slights you , d - them ! let them have a care of ME . I shall marry early Trix will be a duchess by that time , most likely ; for a cannon ball may knock over his grace any day , you know . "
104657	104660	104662	104662	Harry	820	" How ? "
104664	104670	104674	104674	Viscount	597	" Hush , my dear ! "
104676	104702	104705	104705	he	597	" You are of the family you are faithful to us , by George , and I tell you everything . Blandford will marry her or "
104713	104774	104792	104792	his	820	" you understand the rest . Blandford knows which of us two is the best weapon . At small - sword , or back - sword , or sword and dagger if he likes ; I can beat him . I have tried him , Harry ; and begad he knows I am a man not to be trifled with . "
104775	104782	104784	104784	Harry	820	" But you do not mean , "
104795	104823	104784	104784	Harry	820	" that you can force my Lord Blandford , the son of the first man of this kingdom , to marry your sister at sword 's point ? "
104824	104941	104792	104792	his	820	" I mean to say that we are cousins by the mother 's side , though that 's nothing to boast of . I mean to say that an Esmond is as good as a Churchill ; and when the King comes back , the Marquis of Esmond 's sister may be a match for any nobleman 's daughter in the kingdom . There are but two marquises in all England , William Herbert Marquis of Powis , and Francis James Marquis of Esmond ; and hark you , Harry , now swear you will never mention this . Give me your honor as a gentleman , for you ARE a gentleman , though you are a "
104942	104947	104949	104949	Harry	820	" Well , well ? "
104955	105118	104949	104949	Harry	820	" Well , then , when after my late viscount 's misfortune , my mother went up with us to London , to ask for justice against you all as for Mohun , I 'll have his blood , as sure as my name is Francis Viscount Esmond we went to stay with our cousin my Lady Marlborough , with whom we had quarrelled for ever so long . But when misfortune came , she stood by her blood : so did the Dowager Viscountess stand by her blood , so did you . Well , sir , whilst my mother was petitioning the late Prince of Orange for I will never call him king and while you were in prison , we lived at my Lord Marlborough 's house , who was only a little there , being away with the army in Holland . And then . . . I say , Harry , you wo n't tell , now ? "
105127	105336	105119	105119	Harry	820	" Well , there used to be all sorts of fun , you know : my Lady Marlborough was very fond of us , and she said I was to be her page ; and she got Trix to be a maid of honor , and while she was up in her room crying , we used to be always having fun , you know ; and the Duchess used to kiss me , and so did her daughters , and Blandford fell tremendous in love with Trix , and she liked him ; and one day he he kissed her behind a door he did though , and the Duchess caught him , and she banged such a box of the ear both at Trix and Blandford you should have seen it ! And then she said that we must leave directly , and abused my mamma who was cognizant of the business ; but she was n't never thinking about anything but father . And so we came down to Walcote . Blandford being locked up , and not allowed to see Trix . But I got at him . I climbed along the gutter , and in through the window , where he was crying . "
105369	105420	105428	105428	I	0	" ' Oh , viscount , ' says he ' oh , my dearest Frank ! ' and he threw himself into my arms and burst out a - crying . ' I do love Mistress Beatrix so , that I shall die if I do n't have her . ' "
105461	105610	105620	105620	Esmond	757	" ' But I 'll wait twenty years , if she 'll have me , ' says he . ' I 'll never marry no , never , never , never , marry anybody but her . No , not a princess , though they would have me do it ever so . If Beatrix will wait for me , her Blandford swears he will be faithful . ' And he wrote a paper it was n't spelt right , for he wrote ' I 'm ready to SINE WITH MY BLODE , ' which , you know , Harry , is n't the way of spelling it , and vowing that he would marry none other but the Honorable Mistress Gertrude Beatrix Esmond , only sister of his dearest friend Francis James , fourth Viscount Esmond . And so I gave him a locket of her hair . "
105611	105618	105620	105620	Esmond	757	" A locket of her hair ? "
105622	105746	105620	105620	Esmond	757	" Yes . Trix gave me one after the fight with the Duchess that very day . I am sure I did n't want it ; and so I gave it him , and we kissed at parting , and said ' Good - by , brother . ' And I got back through the gutter ; and we set off home that very evening . And he went to King 's College , in Cambridge , and I'M going to Cambridge soon ; and if he does n't stand to his promise for he 's only wrote once , he knows I wear a sword , Harry . Come along , and let 's go see the cocking - match at Winchester . "
105755	105765	105752	105752	I	0	" he added , laughing , after a pause , "
105826	105856	105788	105788	she	461	" That night Mr. Harry 's sleep was by no means so pleasant or sweet as it had been on the first two evenings after his arrival at Walcote . "
105868	105872	105788	105788	she	461	" thought he , "
106058	106081	106055	106056	my master	12319	" here he fell to thinking with a passionate grief of the vow which he had made to his poor dying lord . "
106116	106126	106084	106085	my mistress	11551	" And then came a fiercer pang of temptation . "
106132	106136	106084	106085	my mistress	11551	" Harry thought , "
106199	106380	106382	106382	you	6062	" The next day , although Esmond gave no sign of what was going on in his mind , but strove to be more than ordinarily gay and cheerful when he met his friends at the morning meal , his dear mistress , whose clear eyes it seemed no emotion of his could escape , perceived that something troubled him , for she looked anxiously towards him more than once during the breakfast , and when he went up to his chamber afterwards she presently followed him , and knocked at his door . As she entered , no doubt the whole story was clear to her at once , for she found our young gentleman packing his valise , pursuant to the resolution which he had come to over - night of making a brisk retreat out of this temptation . She closed the door very carefully behind her , and then leant against it , very pale , her hands folded before her , looking at the young man , who was kneeling over his work of packing . "
106387	106437	106382	106382	you	6062	" she said . He rose up from his knees , blushing , perhaps , to be so discovered , in the very act , as it were , and took one of her fair little hands it was that which had her marriage ring on and kissed it . "
106450	106454	106455	106455	I	0	" he said . "
106497	106498	106486	106486	Frank	757	" "
106509	106519	106486	106486	Frank	757	" Esmond said , as gayly as he could . "
106623	106643	106644	106644	I	0	" My lady glanced at the letter , and put it down with a smile that was somewhat contemptuous . "
106653	106689	106644	106644	I	0	" says she indeed , ' twas as well she did not ; for the Chelsey missive , in the poor Dowager 's usual French jargon , permitted him a longer holiday than he said . "
106694	106699	106644	106644	I	0	" quoth her ladyship , "
106711	106712	106713	106713	I	0	" "
106722	106726	106713	106713	I	0	" says she . "
106736	106737	106738	106738	He	757	" "
106747	106752	106738	106738	He	757	" Mr. Esmond answered . "
106809	106810	106796	106796	I	0	" "
106818	106822	106823	106823	I	0	" said she ; "
106882	106883	106886	106886	them	6079	" "
106888	106899	106884	106884	I	0	" said Mr. Esmond , interrupting her with a smile . "
106955	106956	106935	106935	You	427	" "
106973	106979	106961	106961	Harry	427	" cried out Lady Castlewood . "
107238	107667	107224	107224	you	11425	" In after life , did Esmond find the words true which his fond mistress spoke from her sad heart ? Warning he had : but I doubt others had warning before his time , and since : and he benefited by it as most men do . My young Lord Viscount was exceeding sorry when he heard that Harry could not come to the cock - match with him , and must go to London , but no doubt my lord consoled himself when the Hampshire cocks won the match ; and he saw every one of the battles , and crowed properly over the conquered Sussex gentlemen . As Esmond rode towards town his servant , coming up to him , informed him with a grin , that Mistress Beatrix had brought out a new gown and blue stockings for that day 's dinner , in which she intended to appear , and had flown into a rage and given her maid a slap on the face soon after she heard he was going away . Mistress Beatrix 's woman , the fellow said , came down to the servants ' hall crying , and with the mark of a blow still on her cheek : but Esmond peremptorily ordered him to fall back and be silent , and rode on with thoughts enough of his own to occupy him some sad ones , some inexpressibly dear and pleasant . His mistress , from whom he had been a year separated , was his dearest mistress again . The family from which he had been parted , and which he loved with the fondest devotion , was his family once more . If Beatrix 's beauty shone upon him , it was with a friendly lustre , and he could regard it with much such a delight as he brought away after seeing the beautiful pictures of the smiling Madonnas in the convent at Cadiz , when he was despatched thither with a flag ; and as for his mistress , ' twas difficult to say with what a feeling he regarded her . ' Twas happiness to have seen her ; ' twas no great pang to part ; a filial tenderness , a love that was at once respect and protection , filled his mind as he thought of her ; and near her or far from her , and from that day until now , and from now till death is past and beyond it , he prays that sacred flame may ever burn .

114903	114939	114900	114900	she	6622	" Not from his father certainly not from his mother . How had he come by such noble manners , and the perfect bel air ? That countrified Walcote widow could never have taught him . "

115040	115101	115034	115035	Mr. Steele	559	" and his laugh lights up a conversation as much as ten repartees from Mr. Congreve .

117336	117339	117341	117342	his friend	2318	" No , "
117350	117406	117341	117342	his friend	2318	" we are not come to such straits as that , Dick . I have been hiding , sir , at a place where people never think of finding you at my own lodgings , whither I am going to smoke a pipe now and drink a glass of sack : will your honor come ? "
117407	117414	117417	117417	Dick	558	" Harry Esmond , come hither , "
117419	117438	117417	117417	Dick	558	" Thou hast heard me talk over and over again of my dearest Joe , my guardian angel ? "
117439	117442	117444	117445	Mr. Esmond	427	" Indeed , "
117451	117518	117520	117521	Mr. Esmond	427	" it is not from you only that I have learnt to admire Mr. Addison . We loved good poetry at Cambridge as well as at Oxford ; and I have some of yours by heart , though I have put on a red coat . . . . ' O qui canoro blandius Orpheo vocale ducis carmen ; ' shall I go on , sir ? "
117550	117560	117562	117562	Steele	558	" This is Captain Esmond who was at Blenheim , "
117564	117568	117570	117571	the other	1781	" Lieutenant Esmond , "
117578	117585	117570	117571	the other	1781	" at Mr. Addison 's service . "
117592	117622	117586	117586	I	0	" says Mr. Addison , with a smile ; as , indeed , everybody about town had heard that unlucky story about Esmond 's dowager aunt and the Duchess . "
117639	117643	117629	117629	George	456	" says Steele : "
117651	117696	117649	117649	Joe	445	" Mr. Addison said his own lodgings were hard by , where he was still rich enough to give a good bottle of wine to his friends ; and invited the two gentlemen to his apartment in the Haymarket , whither we accordingly went . "
117705	117713	117715	117715	she	6748	" says he , with a smile , "
117728	117792	117715	117715	she	6748	" And he politely made his visitors welcome to his apartment , which was indeed but a shabby one , though no grandee of the land could receive his guests with a more perfect and courtly grace than this gentleman . A frugal dinner , consisting of a slice of meat and a penny loaf , was awaiting the owner of the lodgings . "
117801	117806	117807	117807	my	0	" says Mr. Addison ; "
117815	117850	117809	117809	Halifax	872	" And he set a bottle and glasses before his friends , and ate his simple dinner in a very few minutes , after which the three fell to , and began to drink . "
117854	117887	117809	117809	Halifax	872	" says Mr. Addison , pointing to his writing - table , whereon was a map of the action at Hochstedt , and several other gazettes and pamphlets relating to the battle , "
117922	118070	118071	118071	You	6755	" So Esmond , at the request of his host , told him what he knew about the famous battle , drew the river on the table aliquo mero , and with the aid of some bits of tobacco - pipe showed the advance of the left wing , where he had been engaged . A sheet or two of the verses lay already on the table beside our bottles and glasses , and Dick having plentifully refreshed himself from the latter , took up the pages of manuscript , writ out with scarce a blot or correction , in the author 's slim , neat handwriting , and began to read therefrom with great emphasis and volubility . At pauses of the verse , the enthusiastic reader stopped and fired off a great salvo of applause . Esmond smiled at the enthusiasm of Addison 's friend . "
118078	118082	118074	118076	the German Burghers	6756	" says he , "
118120	118121	118132	118132	they	6761	" "
118134	118160	118132	118132	they	6761	" says Captain Steele , gayly filling up a bumper ; he never was tardy at that sort of acknowledgment of a friend 's merit . "
118176	118191	118193	118194	his friends	1311	" says Mr. Addison , with a smile , and something of a blush , "
118213	118423	118205	118205	I	0	" and he filled himself a glass . Joseph required scarce more pressing than Dick to that sort of amusement ; but the wine never seemed at all to fluster Mr. Addison 's brains ; it only unloosed his tongue : whereas Captain Steele 's head and speech were quite overcome by a single bottle . No matter what the verses were , and , to say truth , Mr. Esmond found some of them more than indifferent , Dick 's enthusiasm for his chief never faltered , and in every line from Addison 's pen , Steele found a master - stroke . By the time Dick had come to that part of the poem , wherein the bard describes as blandly as though he were recording a dance at the opera , or a harmless bout of bucolic cudgelling at a village fair , that bloody and ruthless part of our campaign , with the remembrance whereof every soldier who bore a part in it must sicken with shame when we were ordered to ravage and lay waste the Elector 's country ; and with fire and murder , slaughter and crime , a great part of his dominions was overrun ; when Dick came to the lines "
118526	118563	118564	118564	I	0	" by this time wine and friendship had brought poor Dick to a perfectly maudlin state , and he hiccupped out the last line with a tenderness that set one of his auditors a - laughing . "
118572	118614	118564	118564	I	0	" says Esmond to Mr. Addison . Dick , after reading of the verses , was fain to go off , insisting on kissing his two dear friends before his departure , and reeling away with his periwig over his eyes . "
118663	118680	118655	118655	you	6776	" by this time , perhaps , the wine had warmed Mr. Esmond 's head too , "
118878	118901	118904	118904	you	6776	" During this little outbreak , Mr. Addison was listening , smoking out of his long pipe , and smiling very placidly . "
118907	118911	118904	118904	you	6776	" says he . "
119098	119104	119094	119096	our great Duke	6801	" Mr. Addison went on , "
119373	119401	119370	119371	the conqueror	6017	" ' Rheni pacator et Istri Omnis in hoc uno variis discordia cessit Ordinibus ; laetatur eques , plauditque senator , Votaque patricio certant plebeia favori . ' "
119402	119412	119414	119415	Mr. Esmond	427	" There were as brave men on that field , "
119448	119492	119370	119371	the conqueror	6017	" there were men at Blenheim as good as the leader , whom neither knights nor senators applauded , nor voices plebeian or patrician favored , and who lie there forgotten , under the clods . What poet is there to sing them ? "
119493	119505	119507	119508	Mr. Addison	445	" To sing the gallant souls of heroes sent to Hades ! "
119514	119749	119507	119508	Mr. Addison	445	" Would you celebrate them all ? If I may venture to question anything in such an admirable work , the catalogue of the ships in Homer hath always appeared to me as somewhat wearisome ; what had the poem been , supposing the writer had chronicled the names of captains , lieutenants , rank and file ? One of the greatest of a great man 's qualities is success ; ' tis the result of all the others ; ' tis a latent power in him which compels the favor of the gods , and subjugates fortune . Of all his gifts I admire that one in the great Marlborough . To be brave ? every man is brave . But in being victorious , as he is , I fancy there is something divine . In presence of the occasion , the great soul of the leader shines out , and the god is confessed . Death itself respects him , and passes by him to lay others low . War and carnage flee before him to ravage other parts of the field , as Hector from before the divine Achilles . You say he hath no pity ; no more have the gods , who are above it , and superhuman . The fainting battle gathers strength at his aspect ; and , wherever he rides , victory charges with him . "
119796	119799	119809	119810	Mr. Addison	445	" Campaign . "
119895	119906	119908	119910	the Court gentleman	6832	" How goes on the magnum opus , Mr. Addison ? "
119923	119931	119933	119933	Addison	445	" We were but now over it , "
119954	119960	119962	119962	he	445	" Here is the plan , "
119964	120036	119962	119962	he	445	" on the table : hac ibat Simois , here ran the little river Nebel : hic est Sigeia tellus , here are Tallard 's quarters , at the bowl of this pipe , at the attack of which Captain Esmond was present . I have the honor to introduce him to Mr. Boyle ; and Mr. Esmond was but now depicting aliquo proelia mixta mero , when you came in . "
120111	120122	120124	120124	Addison	445	" And for you , you are but a lieutenant , "
120126	120145	120124	120124	Addison	445	" and the Muse ca n't occupy herself with any gentleman under the rank of a field officer . "
120206	120222	120223	120223	he	445	" Inspired repulsed battalions to engage , And taught the doubtful battle where to rage , "
120239	120261	120231	120231	Esmond	427	" You know where that simile came from from our talk , and our bottle of Burgundy , the other day . "
120292	120302	120304	120304	he	445	" Not a word more , my dear sir , "
120306	120381	120304	120304	he	445	" Trust me with the papers I 'll defend them with my life . Let me read them over to my Lord Treasurer , whom I am appointed to see in half an hour . I venture to promise , the verses shall lose nothing by my reading , and then , sir , we shall see whether Lord Halifax has a right to complain that his friend 's pension is no longer paid . "
120439	120448	120450	120450	Addison	445	" Does not the chamber look quite dark ? "
120455	120516	120517	120517	he	445	" after the glorious appearance and disappearance of that gracious messenger ? Why , he illuminated the whole room . Your scarlet , Mr. Esmond , will bear any light ; but this threadbare old coat of mine , how very worn it looked under the glare of that splendor ! I wonder whether they will do anything for me , "
120520	120605	120607	120607	he	445	" When I came out of Oxford into the world , my patrons promised me great things ; and you see where their promises have landed me , in a lodging up two pair of stairs , with a sixpenny dinner from the cook 's shop . Well , I suppose this promise will go after the others , and fortune will jilt me , as the jade has been doing any time these seven years . ' I puff the prostitute away , ' "
120620	120909	120911	120912	Mr. Addison	445	" There is no hardship in poverty , Esmond , that is not bearable ; no hardship even in honest dependence that an honest man may not put up with . I came out of the lap of Alma Mater , puffed up with her praises of me , and thinking to make a figure in the world with the parts and learning which had got me no small name in our college . The world is the ocean , and Isis and Charwell are but little drops , of which the sea takes no account . My reputation ended a mile beyond Maudlin Tower ; no one took note of me ; and I learned this at least , to bear up against evil fortune with a cheerful heart . Friend Dick hath made a figure in the world , and has passed me in the race long ago . What matters a little name or a little fortune ? There is no fortune that a philosopher can not endure . I have been not unknown as a scholar , and yet forced to live by turning bear - leader , and teaching a boy to spell . What then ? The life was not pleasant , but possible the bear was bearable . Should this venture fail , I will go back to Oxford ; and some day , when you are a general , you shall find me a curate in a cassock and bands , and I shall welcome your honor to my cottage in the country , and to a mug of penny ale . ' Tis not poverty that 's the hardest to bear , or the least happy lot in life , "
120922	121004	120911	120912	Mr. Addison	445	" See , my pipe is smoked out . Shall we have another bottle ? I have still a couple in the cupboard , and of the right sort . No more ? let us go abroad and take a turn on the Mall , or look in at the theatre and see Dick 's comedy . ' Tis not a masterpiece of wit ; but Dick is a good fellow , though he doth not set the Thames on fire . "

121843	121851	121852	121852	he	427	" I ca n't make out Beatrix , "
121891	121947	121888	121889	an angel	1761	" Harry tried to impress on the young fellow the necessity of doing everything in his power to please that angel ; not to drink too much ; not to go into debt ; not to run after the pretty Flemish girls , and so forth , as became a senior speaking to a lad . "
121953	121958	121949	121949	Lord	6919	" the boy said ; "
121977	122002	121969	121969	she	11977	" and so , indeed , he did what he liked . Everybody spoiled him , and his grave kinsman as much as the rest .

123352	123360	123309	123312	One of the gentlemen	6997	" Over the hills and far away ; "
123554	123626	123540	123540	he	427	" Great God ! what a scene of murder is here within a mile of us ; what hundreds and thousands have faced danger to - day ; and here are these lads singing over their cups , and the same moon that is shining over yonder horrid field is looking down on Walcote very likely , while my lady sits and thinks about her boy that is at the war . "
123679	123682	123684	123684	he	427	" Look , "
123686	123697	123684	123684	he	427	" wo n't that be a pretty present for mother ? "
123698	123705	123707	123707	Harry	427	" Who gave you the Order ? "
123713	123721	123707	123707	Harry	427	" did you win it in battle ? "
123722	123727	123729	123730	the other	1781	" I won it , "
123732	123881	123883	123883	he	7017	" with my sword and my spear . There was a mousquetaire that had it round his neck such a big mousquetaire , as big as General Webb . I called out to him to surrender , and that I 'd give him quarter : he called me a petit polisson and fired his pistol at me , and then sent it at my head with a curse . I rode at him , sir , drove my sword right under his arm - hole , and broke it in the rascal 's body . I found a purse in his holster with sixty - five Louis in it , and a bundle of love - letters , and a flask of Hungary - water . Vive la guerre ! there are the ten pieces you lent me . I should like to have a fight every day ; "
124787	124791	124793	124793	Esmond	427	" My Father ! "

124832	124850	124818	124818	Esmond	427	" I should know my Father in any garment , black or white , shaven or bearded ; "
124906	124911	124913	124913	he	7084	" You speak Latin , "
124915	124936	124913	124913	he	7084	" in the English way , Harry Esmond ; you have forsaken the old true Roman tongue you once knew . "
124964	124975	124977	124977	Esmond	427	" Others have changed their coats too , my Father , "
124987	125028	124977	124977	Esmond	427	" Hush ! I am Mr. or Captain von Holtz , in the Bavarian Elector 's service , and on a mission to his Highness the Prince of Savoy . You can keep a secret I know from old times . "
125029	125034	125036	125036	Esmond	427	" Captain von Holtz , "
125038	125046	125036	125036	Esmond	427	" I am your very humble servant . "

125067	125104	125063	125063	his	1781	" I have heard of you at Cambridge and afterwards : we have friends everywhere ; and I am told that Mr. Esmond at Cambridge was as good a fencer as he was a bad theologian . "
125122	125128	125130	125131	the other	1781	" Perhaps you are right , "
125146	125254	125130	125131	the other	1781	" you were all but killed at Hochstedt of a wound in the left side . You were before that at Vigo , aide - de - camp to the Duke of Ormonde . You got your company the other day after Ramillies ; your general and the Prince - Duke are not friends ; he is of the Webbs of Lydiard Tregoze , in the county of York , a relation of my Lord St. John . Your cousin , M. de Castlewood , served his first campaign this year in the Guard ; yes , I do know a few things , as you see . "

125410	125413	125415	125416	Father Holt	509	" Yes , "
125423	125508	125415	125416	Father Holt	509	" for a man who has not been in England these eight years , I know what goes on in London very well . The old Dean is dead , my Lady Castlewood 's father . Do you know that your recusant bishops wanted to consecrate him Bishop of Southampton , and that Collier is Bishop of Thetford by the same imposition ? The Princess Anne has the gout and eats too much ; when the King returns , Collier will be an archbishop . "
125509	125512	125514	125514	Esmond	483	" Amen ! "
125518	125540	125514	125514	Esmond	483	" and I hope to see your Eminence no longer in jack - boots , but red stockings , at Whitehall . "
125541	125572	125415	125416	Father Holt	509	" You are always with us I know that I heard of that when you were at Cambridge ; so was the late lord ; so is the young viscount . "
125573	125582	125584	125585	Mr. Esmond	427	" And so was my father before me , "
125693	125705	125707	125707	Esmond	427	" And you , mon capitaine , where have you been ? "
125724	125732	125734	125734	he	427	" I may have been in Pekin , "
125736	125775	125734	125734	he	427	" or I may have been in Paraguay who knows where ? I am now Captain von Holtz , in the service of his Electoral Highness , come to negotiate exchange of prisoners with his Highness of Savoy . "
126638	126642	126644	126644	he	7177	" My business , "
126645	126725	126644	126644	he	7177	" and I tell you , both because I can trust you and your keen eyes have already discovered it is between the King of England and his subjects here engaged in fighting the French king . As between you and them , all the Jesuits in the world will not prevent your quarrelling : fight it out , gentlemen . St. George for England , I say and you know who says so , wherever he may be . "
127035	127052	127053	127053	Esmond	427	" The family at Castlewood have done far more for me than my own ever did , "
127056	127083	127053	127053	Esmond	427	" I would give my life for them . Why should I grudge the only benefit that ' tis in my power to confer on them ? "
127324	127334	127336	127336	he	427	" I have thought of that question , too , "
127338	127342	127344	127344	he	427	" dear Father , "
127350	127429	127430	127430	Esmond	427	" thought it out for myself , as all men must , and contrive to do the right , and trust to heaven as devoutly in my way as you in yours . Another six months of you as a child , and I had desired no better . I used to weep upon my pillow at Castlewood as I thought of you , and I might have been a brother of your order ; and who knows , "
127437	127456	127430	127430	Esmond	427	" a priest in full orders , and with a pair of mustachios , and a Bavarian uniform ? "
127457	127461	127463	127464	Father Holt	509	" My son , "
127469	127482	127463	127464	Father Holt	509	" in the cause of religion and loyalty all disguises are fair . "
127483	127486	127489	127489	Esmond	427	" Yes , "
127491	127584	127489	127489	Esmond	427	" all disguises are fair , you say ; and all uniforms , say I , black or red , a black cockade or a white one or a laced hat , or a sombrero , with a tonsure under it . I can not believe that St. Francis Xavier sailed over the sea in a cloak , or raised the dead I tried , and very nearly did once , but can not . Suffer me to do the right , and to hope for the best in my own way . "
127756	127764	127765	127765	Holt	511	" She was of this very town , "
127791	127989	127784	127784	he	511	" In 1676 , when your father came hither in the retinue of the late king , then Duke of York , and banished hither in disgrace , Captain Thomas Esmond became acquainted with your mother , pursued her , and made a victim of her ; he hath told me in many subsequent conversations , which I felt bound to keep private then , that she was a woman of great virtue and tenderness , and in all respects a most fond , faithful creature . He called himself Captain Thomas , having good reason to be ashamed of his conduct towards her , and hath spoken to me many times with sincere remorse for that , as with fond love for her many amiable qualities , he owned to having treated her very ill : and that at this time his life was one of profligacy , gambling , and poverty . She became with child of you ; was cursed by her own parents at that discovery ; though she never upbraided , except by her involuntary tears , and the misery depicted on her countenance , the author of her wretchedness and ruin . "
128171	128262	128263	128263	He	7243	" Your father 's wound took a favorable turn perhaps his conscience was eased by the right he had done and to the surprise of the doctors he recovered . But as his health came back , his wicked nature , too , returned . He was tired of the poor girl , whom he had ruined ; and receiving some remittance from his uncle , my lord the old viscount , then in England , he pretended business , promised return , and never saw your poor mother more . "
128389	128533	128549	128555	the person who took charge of you	7253	" Poor Gertrude never thought that the news in this letter might be untrue as the rest of your father 's conduct to her . But though a young man of her own degree , who knew her history , and whom she liked before she saw the English gentleman who was the cause of all her misery , offered to marry her , and to adopt you as his own child , and give you his name , she refused him . This refusal only angered her father , who had taken her home ; she never held up her head there , being the subject of constant unkindness after her fall ; and some devout ladies of her acquaintance offering to pay a little pension for her , she went into a convent , and you were put out to nurse . "
128657	128872	128878	128878	Pastoureau	502	" Your nurse 's family were silk - weavers out of France , whither they returned to Arras in French Flanders , shortly before your mother took her vows , carrying you with them , then a child of three years old . ' Twas a town , before the late vigorous measures of the French king , full of Protestants , and here your nurse 's father , old Pastoureau , he with whom you afterwards lived at Ealing , adopted the reformed doctrines , perverting all his house with him . They were expelled thence by the edict of his most Christian Majesty , and came to London , and set up their looms in Spittlefields . The old man brought a little money with him , and carried on his trade , but in a poor way . He was a widower ; by this time his daughter , a widow too , kept house for him , and his son and he labored together at their vocation . Meanwhile your father had publicly owned his conversion just before King Charles 's death in whom our Church had much such another convert , was reconciled to my Lord Viscount Castlewood , and married , as you know , to his daughter . "
129042	129156	129157	129157	He	902	" I must tell you that Captain Thomas , or my Lord Viscount afterwards , was never at a loss for a story , and could cajole a woman or a dun with a volubility , and an air of simplicity at the same time , of which many a creditor of his has been the dupe . His tales used to gather verisimilitude as he went on with them . He strung together fact after fact with a wonderful rapidity and coherence . It required , saving your presence , a very long habit of acquaintance with your father to know when his lordship was l , telling the truth or no . "
129458	129651	129652	129653	Your father	3594	" He expressed the deepest gratitude to the Pastoureau family for the care of the infant : you were now near six years old ; and on Pastoureau bluntly telling him , when he proposed to go that instant and see the darling child , that they never wished to see his ill - omened face again within their doors ; that he might have the boy , though they should all be very sorry to lose him ; and that they would take his money , they being poor , if he gave it ; or bring him up , by God 's help , as they had hitherto done , without : he acquiesced in this at once , with a sigh , said , ' Well , ' twas better that the dear child should remain with friends who had been so admirably kind to him ; ' and in his talk to me afterwards , honestly praised and admired the weaver 's conduct and spirit ; owned that the Frenchman was a right fellow , and he , the Lord have mercy upon him , a sad villain . "
129655	129663	129652	129653	Your father	3594	" Mr. Holt went on to say , "
129889	130010	130011	130011	Esmond	902	" Your little pension was paid regularly enough ; and when your father became Viscount Castlewood on his uncle 's demise , I was employed to keep a watch over you , and ' twas at my instance that you were brought home . Your foster - mother was dead ; her father made acquaintance with a woman whom he married , who quarrelled with his son . The faithful creature came back to Brussels to be near the woman he loved , and died , too , a few months before her . Will you see her cross in the convent cemetery ? The Superior is an old penitent of mine , and remembers Soeur Marie Madeleine fondly still . "
130796	130811	130813	130814	our General	6223	" I think if I had had Galway 's place , and my Fusileers , "
130816	130836	130813	130814	our General	6223	" we would not have laid down our arms , even to our old colonel , as Galway did ; "
131537	131540	131542	131543	my general	7416	" Now , "
131553	131581	131542	131543	my general	7416	" he must fight ; and when he is forced to it , d - it , no man in Europe can stand up against Jack Churchill . "
131931	131945	131946	131949	our gallant old chief	7445	" And if he did not dare to break it up at home , "
131954	131965	131946	131949	our gallant old chief	7445	" he was determined to destroy it before the enemy ; "
132357	132381	132386	132388	Mr. von Holtz	913	" If the Duke of Berwick had but been in the army , the fate of the day would have been very different , "
132392	132414	132386	132388	Mr. von Holtz	913	" and you would have seen that the hero of Almanza was fit to measure swords with the conqueror of Blenheim . "
132638	132641	132643	132643	Holtz	913	" Ah ! "
132655	132799	132645	132646	some folks	7496	" if the king came by his own , how changed the conduct of affairs would be ! His Majesty 's very exile has this advantage , that he is enabled to read England impartially , and to judge honestly of all the eminent men . His sister is always in the hand of one greedy favorite or another , through whose eyes she sees , and to whose flattery or dependants she gives away everything . Do you suppose that his Majesty , knowing England so well as he does , would neglect such a man as General Webb ? He ought to be in the House of Peers as Lord Lydiard . The enemy and all Europe know his merit ; it is that very reputation which certain great people , who hate all equality and independence , can never pardon . "
135201	135219	135221	135222	Mr. Webb	846	" He will be at Roncq time enough to lick my Lord Duke 's trenchers at supper , "
135249	135266	135267	135268	General Webb	846	" If I was Cadogan , I would have a peerage for this day 's work , "
135271	135358	135267	135268	General Webb	846	" and , Harry , thou shouldst have a regiment . Thou hast been reported in the last two actions : thou wert near killed in the first . I shall mention thee in my despatch to his Grace the Commander - in - Chief , and recommend thee to poor Dick Harwood 's vacant majority . Have you ever a hundred guineas to give Cardonnel ? Slip them into his hand to - morrow , when you go to head - quarters with my report . "
135546	135563	135530	135530	He	483	" ' Tis not even writ with his own hand . Read it out , Esmond . "
135570	135659	135565	135565	Esmond	483	" SIR , Mr. Cadogan is just now come in , and has acquainted me with the success of the action you had yesterday in the afternoon against the body of troops commanded by M. de la Mothe , at Wynendael , which must be attributed chiefly to your good conduct and resolution . You may be sure I shall do you justice at home , and be glad on all occasions to own the service you have done in securing this convoy . Yours , c. , M. "
135660	135696	135699	135700	Mr. Webb	846	" Two lines by that d d Cardonnel , and no more , for the taking of Lille for beating five times our number for an action as brilliant as the best he ever fought , "
135702	135736	135699	135700	Mr. Webb	846	" Lieutenant - General ! That 's not his doing . I was the oldest major - general . By , I believe he had been better pleased if I had been beat . "
135758	135765	135766	135766	he	846	" And this is the man , "
135770	135845	135766	135766	he	846	" that 's gorged with gold that 's covered with titles and honors that we won for him and that grudges even a line of praise to a comrade in arms ! Has n't he enough ? Do n't we fight that he may roll in riches ? Well , well , wait for the Gazette , gentlemen . The Queen and the country will do us justice if his Grace denies it us . "
135881	135888	135890	135890	he	846	" Oh , by the Lord ! "
135892	135904	135890	135890	he	846	" I know what I had rather have than a peerage ! "
135905	135913	135914	135916	some of them	2401	" And what is that , sir ? "
135919	135950	135914	135916	some of them	2401	" I had rather have a quarter of an hour with John Churchill , on a fair green field , and only a pair of rapiers between my shirt and his "
135951	135954	135890	135890	he	846	" Sir ! "
135958	136026	135914	135916	some of them	2401	" Tell him so ! I know that 's what you mean . I know every word goes to him that 's dropped from every general officer 's mouth . I do n't say he 's not brave . Curse him ! he 's brave enough ; but we 'll wait for the Gazette , gentlemen . God save her Majesty ! she 'll do us justice . "

136484	136497	136499	136499	Frank	597	" Here it is Action of Wynendael here you are , General , "
136597	136607	136608	136610	the young fellow	12701	" I thought he 'd like it , Harry , "
136613	136642	136608	136610	the young fellow	12701	" Did n't I like to read my name after Ramillies , in the London Gazette ? Viscount Castlewood serving a volunteer I say , what 's yonder ? "
136669	136675	136676	136676	His	5562	" Will your Highness please to "
136686	136697	136678	136681	the Duke of Marlborough	697	" There 's some mistake , my dear General Webb . "
136698	136706	136708	136709	Mr. Webb	846	" Your Grace had better rectify it , "
136774	136777	136779	136779	he	846	" Stay , "
136816	136826	136804	136804	he	846	" Permit me to hand it to your Grace . "
136833	136837	136839	136839	he	846	" Take it , "
137056	137117	137053	137053	he	846	" Your Grace must be aware that the sudden perusal of the London Gazette , in which your Grace 's secretary , Mr. Cardonnel , hath mentioned Major - General Cadogan 's name as the officer commanding in the late action of Wynendael , must have caused a feeling of anything but pleasure to the General who fought that action . "
137257	137324	137326	137326	his	846	" As soon as the military operations of the year are over , Lieutenant - General Webb will request permission to leave the army , and return to his place in Parliament , where he gives notice to his Grace the Commander - in Chief , that he shall lay his case before the House of Commons , the country , and her Majesty the Queen . "
137418	137512	137528	137528	he	6119	" Mr. Webb knows his duty too well to think of insubordination to his superior officer , or of using his sword in a campaign against any but the enemies of her Majesty . He solicits permission to return to England immediately the military duties will permit , and take with him to England Captain Esmond , of his regiment , who acted as his aide - de - camp , and was present during the entire action , and noted by his watch the time when Mr. Cadogan arrived at its close .

138563	138572	138573	138574	Mr. Esmond	427	" Will you go away , my lord ? "
138586	138592	138573	138574	Mr. Esmond	427	" No , by G , "
138598	138608	138595	138596	Lord Mohun	676	" I 'll not go away for any man ; "

138731	138751	138725	138726	Mr. Esmond	427	" The story my Lord Mohun has told respecting General Webb is false , gentlemen false , I repeat , "

138934	138956	138930	138931	young Castlewood	597	" I ca n't walk without a crutch : but I could have met him on horseback with sword and pistol . "

140936	141091	141092	141093	my lady	11267	" But she will make no mean match , Harry : she will not marry as I would have her ; the person whom I should like to call my son , and Henry Esmond knows who that is , is best served by my not pressing his claim . Beatrix is so wilful , that what I would urge on her , she would be sure to resist . The man who would marry her , will not be happy with her , unless he be a great person , and can put her in a great position . Beatrix loves admiration more than love ; and longs , beyond all things , for command . Why should a mother speak so of her child ? You are my son , too , Harry . You should know the truth about your sister . I thought you might cure yourself of your passion , "
141098	141255	141092	141093	my lady	11267	" Other people can cure themselves of that folly , you know . But I see you are still as infatuated as ever . When we read your name in the Gazette , I pleaded for you , my poor boy . Poor boy , indeed ! You are growing a grave old gentleman , now , and I am an old woman . She likes your fame well enough , and she likes your person . She says you have wit , and fire , and good - breeding , and are more natural than the fine gentlemen of the Court . But this is not enough . She wants a commander - in - chief , and not a colonel . Were a duke to ask her , she would leave an earl whom she had promised . I told you so before . I know not how my poor girl is so worldly . "
141256	141259	141261	141261	Esmond	427	" Well , "
141263	141505	141261	141261	Esmond	427	" a man can but give his best and his all . She has that from me . What little reputation I have won , I swear I cared for it because I thought Beatrix would be pleased with it . What care I to be a colonel or a general ? Think you ' twill matter a few score years hence , what our foolish honors to - day are ? I would have had a little fame , that she might wear it in her hat . If I had anything better , I would endow her with it . If she wants my life , I would give it her . If she marries another , I will say God bless him . I make no boast , nor no complaint . I think my fidelity is folly , perhaps . But so it is . I can not help myself . I love her . You are a thousand times better : the fondest , the fairest , the dearest of women . Sure , my dear lady , I see all Beatrix 's faults as well as you do . But she is my fate . ' Tis endurable . I shall not die for not having her . I think I should be no happier if I won her . Que voulez - vous ? as my Lady of Chelsey would say . Je l'aime . "
141506	141514	141516	141516	Harry	427	" I wish she would have you , "
141580	141583	141585	141585	he	427	" Why , "

141888	141909	141910	141910	Our	7951	" She smiled as she spoke , and looked like an angel that was only on earth on a visit . "
142120	142156	142110	142110	He	7962	" She stopped , then presently , with a peculiar expression , as if her eyes were looking into heaven , and saw my lord there , she smiled , and gave a little laugh . "
142165	142169	142157	142157	I	0	" she says ; "
142183	142565	142157	142157	I	0	" One may put her words down , and remember them , but how describe her sweet tones , sweeter than music ! My young lord did not come home at the end of the campaign , and wrote that he was kept at Bruxelles on military duty . Indeed , I believe he was engaged in laying siege to a certain lady , who was of the suite of Madame de Soissons , the Prince of Savoy 's mother , who was just dead , and who , like the Flemish fortresses , was taken and retaken a great number of times during the war , and occupied by French , English , and Imperialists . Of course , Mr. Esmond did not think fit to enlighten Lady Castlewood regarding the young scapegrace 's doings : nor had he said a word about the affair with Lord Mohun , knowing how abhorrent that man 's name was to his mistress . Frank did not waste much time or money on pen and ink ; and , when Harry came home with his General , only writ two lines to his mother , to say his wound in the leg was almost healed , that he would keep his coming of age next year that the duty aforesaid would keep him at Bruxelles , and that Cousin Harry would tell all the news . But from Bruxelles , knowing how the Lady Castlewood always liked to have a letter about the famous 29th of December , my lord writ her a long and full one , and in this he must have described the affair with Mohun ; for when Mr. Esmond came to visit his mistress one day , early in the new year , to his great wonderment , she and her daughter both came up and saluted him , and after them the Dowager of Chelsey , too , whose chairman had just brought her ladyship from her village to Kensington across the fields . After this honor , I say , from the two ladies of Castlewood , the Dowager came forward in great state , with her grand tall head - dress of King James 's reign , that , she never forsook , and said , "
142593	142630	142631	142632	Cousin Harry	635	" And pointing to her blushing cheek , she made Mr. Esmond aware that he was to enjoy the rapture of an embrace there . Having saluted one cheek , she turned to him the other . "
142634	142646	142631	142632	Cousin Harry	635	" said both the other ladies , in a little chorus , "
142655	142769	142647	142647	we	7968	" and then Harry became aware that the story of the Lille affair had come to his kinswomen 's ears . It pleased him to hear them all saluting him as one of their family . The tables of the dining - room were laid for a great entertainment ; and the ladies were in gala dresses my Lady of Chelsey in her highest tour , my Lady Viscountess out of black , and looking fair and happy a ravir ; and the Maid of Honor attired with that splendor which naturally distinguished her , and wearing on her beautiful breast the French officer 's star which Frank had sent home after Ramillies . "
142781	142792	142647	142647	we	7968	" says she , glancing down to the star complacently , "
142812	142886	142808	142808	I	0	" Indeed , Esmond 's dear mistress , blushing as he looked at her , with her beautiful fair hair , and an elegant dress according to the mode , appeared to have the shape and complexion of a girl of twenty . On the table was a fine sword , with a red velvet scabbard , and a beautiful chased silver handle , with a blue ribbon for a sword - knot . "

143050	143055	143075	143075	He	725	" his mother said , "

143475	143545	143425	143425	I	0	" By this time there came a thundering knock , that drove in the doors of the house almost . It was three o'clock , and the company were arriving ; and presently the servant announced Captain Steele and his lady . Captain and Mrs. Steele , who were the first to arrive , had driven to Kensington from their country - house , the Hovel at Hampton Wick . "
143554	143771	143425	143425	I	0	" as Mrs. Steele took care to inform the ladies . Indeed Harry had ridden away from Hampton that very morning , leaving the couple by the ears ; for from the chamber where he lay , in a bed that was none of the cleanest , and kept awake by the company which he had in his own bed , and the quarrel which was going on in the next room , he could hear both night and morning the curtain lecture which Mrs. Steele was in the habit of administering to poor Dick . At night it did not matter so much for the culprit ; Dick was fuddled , and when in that way no scolding could interrupt his benevolence . Mr. Esmond could hear him coaxing and speaking in that maudlin manner , which punch and claret produce , to his beloved Prue , and beseeching her to remember that there was a distiwisht officer ithe rex roob , who would overhear her . She went on , nevertheless , calling him a drunken wretch , and was only interrupted in her harangues by the Captain 's snoring . In the morning , the unhappy victim awoke to a headache , and consciousness , and the dialogue of the night was resumed . "
143835	144095	143831	143831	I	0	" and so the dispute went on Mr. Esmond interrupting the talk when it seemed to be growing too intimate by blowing his nose as loudly as ever he could , at the sound of which trumpet there came a lull . But Dick was charming , though his wife was odious , and ' twas to give Mr. Steele pleasure , that the ladies of Castlewood , who were ladies of no small fashion , invited Mrs. Steele . Besides the Captain and his lady , there was a great and notable assemblage of company : my Lady of Chelsey having sent her lackeys and liveries to aid the modest attendance at Kensington . There was Lieutenant - General Webb , Harry 's kind patron , of whom the Dowager took possession , and who resplended in velvet and gold lace ; there was Harry 's new acquaintance , the Right Honorable Henry St. John , Esquire , the General 's kinsman , who was charmed with the Lady Castlewood , even more than with her daughter ; there was one of the greatest noblemen in the kingdom , the Scots Duke of Hamilton , just created Duke of Brandon in England ; and two other noble lords of the Tory party , my Lord Ashburnham , and another I have forgot ; and for ladies , her Grace the Duchess of Ormonde and her daughters , the Lady Mary and the Lady Betty , the former one of Mistress Beatrix 's colleagues in waiting on the Queen . "
144102	144160	144097	144100	a party of Tories	8010	" whispered Captain Steele to Esmond , as we were assembled in the parlor before dinner . Indeed , all the company present , save Steele , were of that faction . Mr. St. John made his special compliments to Mrs. Steele , and so charmed her that she declared she would have Steele a Tory too . "
144169	144175	144163	144163	you	8011	" says Mr. St. John . "
144189	144190	144163	144163	you	8011	" "

144300	144305	144293	144293	you	8011	" cries Mrs. Steele . "

144440	144460	144484	144484	Mistress	2567	" says Mrs. Steele , who did not seem to understand a word of what the gentleman was saying . "
144472	144483	144484	144484	Mistress	2567	" says Mr. St. John , still gallant and bowing . "
144492	144497	144490	144490	sir	1424	" cries the lady . "
144518	144519	144513	144516	the Captain 's wife	8029	" "
144526	144544	144513	144516	the Captain 's wife	8029	" answers Mr. St. John , keeping his countenance very gravely ; and Steele broke in saying , "
144576	144577	144578	144578	I	0	" "
144592	144598	144589	144590	a poet	6820	" says Mr. St. John . "

144651	144657	144648	144649	Mr. Addison	445	" cries out his lady : "
144699	144718	144682	144682	I	0	" All the black men at table applauded , and made Mrs. Steele a bow for this compliment . "
144725	144730	144731	144731	he	445	" she went on , "
144786	144787	144768	144768	he	445	" "
144799	144805	144795	144795	You	1424	" says Mr. St. John . "

144837	144843	144827	144827	I	0	" continues the voluble lady . "

144887	144892	144867	144867	he	2533	" whispers her companion . "
144905	144910	144895	144895	I	0	" says the lady . "
144939	144940	144919	144924	this little dwarf of a fellow	8046	" "
144949	144968	144945	144947	a little crook	8050	" says my mistress , laughing from her end of the table : on which Mrs. Steele said , "
145021	145022	145005	145005	Dick	960	" "
145036	145042	145033	145034	Mrs. Steele	959	" asked Mr. St. John . "
145060	145065	145058	145058	sir	1424	" says the lady . "
145104	145105	145101	145102	Captain Steele	725	" "
145115	145224	145106	145106	I	0	" says the Captain , who seemed to think his wife charming , and to receive as genuine all the satiric compliments which Mr. St. John paid her . All this while the Maid of Honor had been trying to get Mr. Esmond to talk , and no doubt voted him a dull fellow . For , by some mistake , just as he was going to pop into the vacant place , he was placed far away from Beatrix 's chair , who sat between his Grace and my Lord Ashburnham , and shrugged her lovely white shoulders , and cast a look as if to say , "
145228	145387	145106	145106	I	0	" to her cousin . My Lord Duke and his young neighbor were presently in a very animated and close conversation . Mrs. Beatrix could no more help using her eyes than the sun can help shining , and setting those it shines on a - burning . By the time the first course was done the dinner seemed long to Esmond ; by the time the soup came he fancied they must have been hours at table : and as for the sweets and jellies he thought they never would be done . At length the ladies rose , Beatrix throwing a Parthian glance at her duke as she retreated ; a fresh bottle and glasses were fetched , and toasts were called . Mr. St. John asked his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and the company to drink to the health of his Grace the Duke of Brandon . Another lord gave General Webb 's health , "
145402	145425	145503	145504	the General	5562	" Mr. Webb thanked the company , complimented his aide - de - camp , and fought his famous battle over again . "
145430	145436	145503	145504	the General	5562	" whispers Mr. St. John , "
145443	145471	145440	145441	de Wynendael	301	" Captain Steele , who was not of our side , loyally gave the health of the Duke of Marlborough , the greatest general of the age . "
145483	145488	145472	145472	I	0	" says Mr. Webb ; "
145515	145601	145509	145510	the Duke	1572	" And the stout old gentleman emptied his bumper ; to which Dick replied by filling and emptying a pair of brimmers , one for the General and one for the Duke . And now his Grace of Hamilton , rising up with flashing eyes we had all been drinking pretty freely , proposed a toast to the lovely , to the incomparable Mrs. Beatrix Esmond ; we all drank it with cheers , and my Lord Ashburnham especially , with a shout of enthusiasm . "
145612	145674	145607	145610	a Duchess of Hamilton	8066	" whispers St. John , who drank more wine and yet was more steady than most of the others , and we entered the drawing - room where the ladies were at their tea . As for poor Dick , we were obliged to leave him alone at the dining - table , where he was hiccupping out the lines from the "
145677	146073	145607	145610	a Duchess of Hamilton	8066	" in which the greatest poet had celebrated the greatest general in the world ; and Harry Esmond found him , half an hour afterwards , in a more advanced stage of liquor , and weeping about the treachery of Tom Boxer . The drawing - room was all dark to poor Harry , in spite of the grand illumination . Beatrix scarce spoke to him . When my Lord Duke went away , she practised upon the next in rank , and plied my young Lord Ashburnham with all the fire of her eyes and the fascinations of her wit . Most of the party were set to cards , and Mr. St. John , after yawning in the face of Mrs. Steele , whom he did not care to pursue any more ; and talking in his most brilliant animated way to Lady Castlewood , whom he pronounced to be beautiful , of a far higher order of beauty than her daughter , presently took his leave , and went his way . The rest of the company speedily followed , my Lord Ashburnham the last , throwing fiery glances at the smiling young temptress , who had bewitched more hearts than his in her thrall . No doubt , as a kinsman of the house , Mr. Esmond thought fit to be the last of all in it ; he remained after the coaches had rolled away after his dowager aunt 's chair and flambeaux had marched off in the darkness towards Chelsey , and the town 's people had gone to bed , who had been drawn into the square to gape at the unusual assemblage of chairs and chariots , lackeys , and torchmen . The poor mean wretch lingered yet for a few minutes , to see whether the girl would vouchsafe him a smile , or a parting word of consolation . But her enthusiasm of the morning was quite died out , or she chose to be in a different mood . She fell to joking about the dowdy appearance of Lady Betty , and mimicked the vulgarity of Mrs. Steele ; and then she put up her little hand to her mouth and yawned , lighted a taper , and shrugged her shoulders , and dropping Mr. Esmond a saucy curtsy , sailed off to bed . "
146091	146138	146083	146083	I	0	" was all the consolation that poor Esmond 's fond mistress could give him ; and as he trudged home through the dark alone , he thought with bitter rage in his heart , and a feeling of almost revolt against the sacrifice he had made : "
146144	146148	146139	146139	She	8067	" thought he , "
146176	146487	146494	146494	Colonel	979	" I suppose a man 's vanity is stronger than any other passion in him ; for I blush , even now , as I recall the humiliation of those distant days , the memory of which still smarts , though the fever of balked desire has passed away more than a score of years ago . When the writer 's descendants come to read this memoir , I wonder will they have lived to experience a similar defeat and shame ? Will they ever have knelt to a woman who has listened to them , and played with them , and laughed with them who beckoning them with lures and caresses , and with Yes smiling from her eyes , has tricked them on to their knees , and turned her back and left them . All this shame Mr. Esmond had to undergo ; and he submitted , and revolted , and presently came crouching back for more . After this feste , my young Lord Ashburnham 's coach was for ever rolling in and out of Kensington Square ; his lady - mother came to visit Esmond 's mistress , and at every assembly in the town , wherever the Maid of Honor made her appearance , you might be pretty sure to see the young gentleman in a new suit every week , and decked out in all the finery that his tailor or embroiderer could furnish for him . My lord was for ever paying Mr. Esmond compliments : bidding him to dinner , offering him horses to ride , and giving him a thousand uncouth marks of respect and good - will . At last , one night at the coffee - house , whither my lord came considerably flushed and excited with drink , he rushes up to Mr. Esmond , and cries out "
146503	146504	146505	146508	The happiest of men	8071	" "
146518	146523	146510	146512	no dearest colonel	8074	" says Mr. Esmond . "
146533	146534	146510	146512	no dearest colonel	8074	" "
146540	146544	146537	146537	you	979	" says he . "
146567	146568	146560	146560	Beatrix	837	" "
146571	146601	146560	146560	Beatrix	837	" cries out Mr. Esmond , who had spent happy hours with Beatrix that very morning had writ verses for her , that she had sung at the harpsichord . "
146604	146608	146609	146609	I	0	" says he ; "
146736	146834	146730	146734	the finest woman in England	8080	" Esmond left the young lord tossing off bumper after bumper , and strolled away to Kensington to ask whether the news was true . ' Twas only too sure : his mistress 's sad , compassionate face told him the story ; and then she related what particulars of it she knew , and how my young lord had made his offer , half an hour after Esmond went away that morning , and in the very room where the song lay yet on the harpsichord , which Esmond had writ , and they had sung together .

I tell you , she used to make eyes at the Duke of Marlborough , when she was only fourteen , and ogling poor little Blandford . I would n't marry her , Harry no , not if her eyes were twice as big . I 'll take my fun . I 'll enjoy for the next three years every possible pleasure . I 'll sow my wild oats then , and marry some quiet , steady , modest , sensible viscountess ; hunt my harriers ; and settle down at Castlewood . Perhaps I 'll represent the county no , damme , YOU shall represent the county . You have the brains of the family . By the Lord , my dear old Harry , you have the best head and the kindest heart in all the army ; and every man says so and when the Queen dies , and the King comes back , why should n't you go to the House of Commons , and be a Minister , and be made a Peer , and that sort of thing ? YOU be shot in the next action ! I wager a dozen of Burgundy you are not touched . Mohun is well of his wound . He is always with Corporal John now .

154542	154656	154539	154540	the Dowager	3074	" I have sent for you , as the doctors say I may go off any day in this dysentery ; and to ease my conscience of a great load that has been on it . You always have been a poor creature and unfit for great honor , and what I have to say wo n't , therefore , affect you so much . You must know , Cousin Rachel , that I have left my house , plate , and furniture , three thousand pounds in money , and my diamonds that my late revered Saint and Sovereign , King James , presented me with , to my Lord Viscount Castlewood .

154657	154662	154664	154665	Lady Castlewood	951	" To my Frank ? "
154667	154672	154664	154665	Lady Castlewood	951	" I was in hopes "
154726	154727	154718	154724	Marchioness of Esmond before God and man	1030	" "
154739	154783	154730	154730	you	951	" asks Lady Castlewood she hath told me the story completely since with her quiet arch way ; the most charming any woman ever had : and I set down the narrative here at length , so as to have done with it . "
154792	154798	154786	154786	you	951	" asks my dear lady : "
154805	154813	154803	154803	Henry	427	" she says with her sweet smile , "
154840	154841	154842	154843	Poor Harry	838	" "
154845	154851	154842	154843	Poor Harry	838	" says the old lady . "
154990	154991	154982	154982	you	8531	" "
155002	155019	154998	154998	you	8531	" cries the other lady thinking perhaps that the old Marchioness was wandering in her wits . "
155033	155039	155029	155031	a wicked wretch	8534	" the sick sinner continued . "
155084	155085	155081	155081	I	0	" "
155106	155107	155081	155081	I	0	" "
155110	155115	155081	155081	I	0	" she went on , "
155235	155297	155224	155233	a queer little melancholy child it was when it came	8552	" Our intention was to make a priest of him : and he was bred for this , until you perverted him from it , you wicked woman . And I had again hopes of giving an heir to my lord , when he was called away upon the King 's business , and died fighting gloriously at the Boyne water . "
155573	155585	155598	155598	she	11551	" As for Colonel Esmond , he knew the truth already . "
155586	155592	155598	155598	she	11551	" And then , Harry , "
155613	155615	155598	155598	she	11551	" . "
155664	155769	155656	155657	his cousin	1560	" This was the substance of the Dowager 's revelation . Dean Atterbury had knowledge of it , Lady Castlewood said , and Esmond very well knows how : that divine being the clergyman for whom the late lord had sent on his death - bed : and when Lady Castlewood would instantly have written to her son , and conveyed the truth to him , the Dean 's advice was that a letter should be writ to Colonel Esmond rather ; that the matter should be submitted to his decision , by which alone the rest of the family were bound to abide . "
155781	155786	155656	155657	his cousin	1560	" says the Colonel . "
155801	155802	155792	155792	Harry	427	" "
155817	155822	155823	155824	The children	1777	" says Colonel Esmond . "
155973	156130	155963	155963	I	0	" As he spoke so to his dearest mistress , for whom he would have been willing to give up his life , or to make any sacrifice any day , the fond creature flung herself down on her knees before him , and kissed both his hands in an outbreak of passionate love and gratitude , such as could not but melt his heart , and make him feel very proud and thankful that God had given him the power to show his love for her , and to prove it by some little sacrifice on his own part . To be able to bestow benefits or happiness on those one loves is sure the greatest blessing conferred upon a man and what wealth or name , or gratification of ambition or vanity , could compare with the pleasure Esmond now had of being able to confer some kindness upon his best and dearest friends ? "
156134	156137	156131	156132	Dearest saint	8600	" says he "
156220	156221	156208	156208	you	8600	" "
156227	156245	156208	156208	you	8600	" she said , in a wild way , to Esmond , who would have lifted her . "
156258	156524	156525	156525	Castlewood	494	" Before such a partial judge as Esmond 's dear mistress owned herself to be , any cause which he might plead was sure to be given in his favor ; and accordingly he found little difficulty in reconciling her to the news whereof he was bearer , of her son 's marriage to a foreign lady , Papist though she was . Lady Castlewood never could be brought to think so ill of that religion as other people in England thought of it : she held that ours was undoubtedly a branch of the Catholic church , but that the Roman was one of the main stems on which , no doubt , many errors had been grafted she was , for a woman , extraordinarily well versed in this controversy , having acted , as a girl , as secretary to her father , the late dean , and written many of his sermons , under his dictation ; and if Frank had chosen to marry a lady of the church of south Europe , as she would call the Roman communion , there was no need why she should not welcome her as a daughter - in - law : and accordingly she wrote to her new daughter a very pretty , touching letter as Esmond thought , who had cognizance of it before it went , in which the only hint of reproof was a gentle remonstrance that her son had not written to herself , to ask a fond mother 's blessing for that step which he was about taking . "
156530	156538	156540	156540	she	494	" so she wrote to her son , "
156587	156607	156554	156554	she	494	" and she besought him to come quickly to England , to settle down in his family house of Castlewood "
156614	156622	156629	156629	your	8603	" says she , to Colonel Esmond , "
156631	156701	156629	156629	your	8603	" and to receive the accompt of her stewardship during his ten years ' minority . By care and frugality , she had got the estate into a better condition than ever it had been since the Parliamentary wars ; and my lord was now master of a pretty , small income , not encumbered of debts , as it had been , during his father 's ruinous time . "
156710	156714	156715	156715	I	0	" says she , "
156729	157179	156717	156717	I	0	" And , indeed , this was the case : her ladyship 's daughter complaining that their mother did all for Frank , and nothing for her ; and Frank himself being dissatisfied at the narrow , simple way of his mother 's living at Walcote , where he had been brought up more like a poor parson 's son than a young nobleman that was to make a figure in the world . ' Twas this mistake in his early training , very likely , that set him so eager upon pleasure when he had it in his power ; nor is he the first lad that has been spoiled by the over - careful fondness of women . No training is so useful for children , great or small , as the company of their betters in rank or natural parts ; in whose society they lose the overweening sense of their own importance , which stay - at - home people very commonly learn . But , as a prodigal that 's sending in a schedule of his debts to his friends , never puts all down , and , you may be sure , the rogue keeps back some immense swingeing bill , that he does n't dare to own ; so the poor Frank had a very heavy piece of news to break to his mother , and which he had n't the courage to introduce into his first confession . Some misgivings Esmond might have , upon receiving Frank 's letter , and knowing into what hands the boy had fallen ; but whatever these misgivings were , he kept them to himself , not caring to trouble his mistress with any fears that might be groundless . However , the next mail which came from Bruxelles , after Frank had received his mother 's letters there , brought back a joint composition from himself and his wife , who could spell no better than her young scapegrace of a husband , full of expressions of thanks , love , and duty to the Dowager Viscountess , as my poor lady now was styled ; and along with this letter which was read in a family council , namely , the Viscountess , Mistress Beatrix , and the writer of this memoir , and which was pronounced to be vulgar by the maid of honor , and felt to be so by the other two , there came a private letter for Colonel Esmond from poor Frank , with another dismal commission for the Colonel to execute , at his best opportunity ; and this was to announce that Frank had seen fit , "
157202	157209	157199	157200	the saints	8608	" says my lord , demurely , "
157246	157370	157371	157374	a young Irish lord	8614	" And his lordship added a postscript , of which Esmond knew the inspiring genius very well , for it had the genuine twang of the Seminary , and was quite unlike poor Frank 's ordinary style of writing and thinking ; in which he reminded Colonel Esmond that he too was , by birth , of that church ; and that his mother and sister should have his lordship 's prayers to the saints an inestimable benefit , truly ! for their conversion . If Esmond had wanted to keep this secret , he could not ; for a day or two after receiving this letter , a notice from Bruxelles appeared in the Post - Boy and other prints , announcing that "
157440	157501	157409	157412	the Duke of Marlborough	697	" The notorious Mr. Holt , who had been employed as a Jacobite agent during the last reign , and many times pardoned by King William , had been , the Post - Boy said , the agent of this conversion . The Lady Castlewood was as much cast down by this news as Miss Beatrix was indignant at it . "
157504	157508	157409	157412	the Duke of Marlborough	697	" says she , "
157626	157636	157640	157640	they	8628	" says Mistress Beatrix , clapping her hands together ; "
157966	157995	157996	157996	I	0	" and here she glanced at her person and the looking - glass , which told her rightly that a more beautiful shape and face never were seen . "
158004	158011	157996	157996	I	0	" says Miss Beatrix , afterwards , "
158416	158423	158414	158414	priests	5344	" And so she rattled on . "
158435	158530	158432	158433	Cousin Beatrix	1035	" says the Colonel . She laughed out the air of a minuet , and swept a low curtsy , coming up to the recover with the prettiest little foot in the world pointed out . Her mother came in as she was in this attitude ; my lady had been in her closet , having taken poor Frank 's conversion in a very serious way ; the madcap girl ran up to her mother , put her arms round her waist , kissed her , tried to make her dance , and said : "
158569	158694	158551	158551	he	1036	" And she kicked off her little slippers the wonderfullest little shoes with wonderful tall red heels : Esmond pounced upon one as it fell close beside him , and she put on the drollest little moue , and marched up and down the room holding Esmond 's cane by way of taper . Serious as her mood was , Lady Castlewood could not refrain from laughing ; and as for Esmond he looked on with that delight with which the sight of this fair creature always inspired him : never had he seen any woman so arch , so brilliant , and so beautiful . Having finished her march , she put out her foot for her slipper . The Colonel knelt down : "
158705	158772	158700	158700	I	0	" says he ; and her Holiness gave him gracious leave to kiss the little stockinged foot before he put the slipper on . Mamma 's feet began to pat on the floor during this operation , and Beatrix , whose bright eyes nothing escaped , saw that little mark of impatience . She ran up and embraced her mother , with her usual cry of , "
158789	158793	158800	158800	she	8707	" says she : "
158820	158821	158811	158811	he	8708	" "
158831	158842	158822	158822	You	8702	" says her mother , blushing over her whole sweet face "
158864	158955	158847	158847	your	8702	" and she said it with a hysteric laugh , that had more of tears than laughter in it ; laying her head on her daughter 's fair shoulder , and hiding it there . They made a very pretty picture together , and looked like a pair of sisters the sweet simple matron seeming younger than her years , and her daughter , if not older , yet somehow , from a commanding manner and grace which she possessed above most women , her mother 's superior and protectress . "
158959	158978	158847	158847	your	8702	" cries my mistress , recovering herself after this scene , and returning to her usual sad tone , "
159007	159008	159035	159035	You	8713	" "
159014	159019	159035	159035	You	8713	" says saucy Mrs. Beatrix "
159099	159100	159096	159097	Queen Mary	8719	" "
159120	159805	159806	159806	Granted	1039	" cries my lady . Beatrix was ordering her ribbons , and adjusting her tucker , and performing a dozen provokingly pretty ceremonies , before the glass . The girl was no hypocrite at least . She never at that time could be brought to think but of the world and her beauty ; and seemed to have no more sense of devotion than some people have of music , that can not distinguish one air from another . Esmond saw this fault in her , as he saw many others a bad wife would Beatrix Esmond make , he thought , for any man under the degree of a Prince . She was born to shine in great assemblies , and to adorn palaces , and to command everywhere to conduct an intrigue of politics , or to glitter in a queen 's train . But to sit at a homely table , and mend the stockings of a poor man 's children ! that was no fitting duty for her , or at least one that she would n't have broke her heart in trying to do . She was a princess , though she had scarce a shilling to her fortune ; and one of her subjects the most abject and devoted wretch , sure , that ever drivelled at a woman 's knees was this unlucky gentleman ; who bound his good sense , and reason , and independence , hand and foot , and submitted them to her . And who does not know how ruthlessly women will tyrannize when they are let to domineer ? and who does not know how useless advice is ? I could give good counsel to my descendants , but I know they 'll follow their own way , for all their grandfather 's sermon . A man gets his own experience about women , and will take nobody 's hearsay ; nor , indeed , is the young fellow worth a fig that would . ' Tis I that am in love with my mistress , not my old grandmother that counsels me : ' tis I that have fixed the value of the thing I would have , and know the price I would pay for it . It may be worthless to you , but ' tis all my life to me . Had Esmond possessed the Great Mogul 's crown and all his diamonds , or all the Duke of Marlborough 's money , or all the ingots sunk at Vigo , he would have given them all for this woman . A fool he was , if you will ; but so is a sovereign a fool , that will give half a principality for a little crystal as big as a pigeon 's egg , and called a diamond : so is a wealthy nobleman a fool , that will face danger or death , and spend half his life , and all his tranquillity , caballing for a blue ribbon ; so is a Dutch merchant a fool , that hath been known to pay ten thousand crowns for a tulip . There 's some particular prize we all of us value , and that every man of spirit will venture his life for . With this , it may be to achieve a great reputation for learning ; with that , to be a man of fashion , and the admiration of the town ; with another , to consummate a great work of art or poetry , and go to immortality that way ; and with another , for a certain time of his life , the sole object and aim is a woman . Whilst Esmond was under the domination of this passion , he remembers many a talk he had with his intimates , who used to rally Our Knight of the Rueful Countenance at his devotion , whereof he made no disguise , to Beatrix ; and it was with replies such as the above he met his friends ' satire . "
159813	159817	159810	159811	a fool	3286	" says he , "
159947	159966	159940	159940	you	8721	" Mr. Esmond often rode to Windsor , and especially , of later days , with the secretary . "
160053	160163	160164	160164	I	0	" And then the Secretary , would fly out in such a rich flow of eloquence , as this pen can not pretend to recall ; advocating his scheme of ambition , showing the great good he would do for his country when he was the undisputed chief of it ; backing his opinion with a score of pat sentences from Greek and Roman authorities of which kind of learning he made rather an ostentatious display , and scornfully vaunting the very arts and meannesses by which fools were to be made to follow him , opponents to be bribed or silenced , doubters converted , and enemies overawed . "
160168	160174	160166	160166	Diogenes	1041	" says Esmond , laughing , "
160282	160283	160299	160299	she	8740	" "
160290	160295	160299	160299	she	8740	" says St. John , "
160350	160354	160327	160327	I	0	" he added ; "

160407	160412	160380	160380	I	0	" says Mr. Esmond . "
160422	160427	160414	160416	Dulcinea del Toboso	983	" says the other . "
160447	160455	160438	160438	thou	8744	" St. John added , with a sigh .
160464	160467	160463	160465	THE " SPECTATOR	14180	" SPECTATOR . "
160802	161021	160797	160799	the little rebel	8761	" Who are you ? I shall go my own way , sirrah , and that way is towards a husband , and I do n't want YOU on the way . I am for your betters , Colonel , for your betters : do you hear that ? You might do if you had an estate and were younger ; only eight years older than I , you say ! pish , you are a hundred years older . You are an old , old Graveairs , and I should make you miserable , that would be the only comfort I should have in marrying you . But you have not money enough to keep a cat decently after you have paid your man his wages , and your landlady her bill . Do you think I am going to live in a lodging , and turn the mutton at a string whilst your honor nurses the baby ? Fiddlestick , and why did you not get this nonsense knocked out of your head when you were in the wars ? You are come back more dismal and dreary than ever . You and mamma are fit for each other . You might be Darby and Joan , and play cribbage to the end of your lives . "
161022	161035	161037	161038	her mother	11361	" At least you own to your worldliness , my poor Trix , "
161040	161318	161037	161038	her mother	11361	" Worldliness . Oh , my pretty lady ! Do you think that I am a child in the nursery , and to be frightened by Bogey ! Worldliness , to be sure ; and pray , madam , where is the harm of wishing to be comfortable ? When you are gone , you dearest old woman , or when I am tired of you and have run away from you , where shall I go ? Shall I go and be head nurse to my Popish sister - in - law , take the children their physic , and whip 'em , and put 'em to bed when they are naughty ? Shall I be Castlewood 's upper servant , and perhaps marry Tom Tusher ? Merci ! I have been long enough Frank 's humble servant . Why am I not a man ? I have ten times his brains , and had I worn the well , do n't let your ladyship be frightened had I worn a sword and periwig instead of this mantle and commode to which nature has condemned me though ' tis a pretty stuff , too Cousin Esmond ! you will go to the Exchange to - morrow , and get the exact counterpart of this ribbon , sir ; do you hear ? I would have made our name talked about . So would Graveairs here have made something out of our name if he had represented it . My Lord Graveairs would have done very well . Yes , you have a very pretty way , and would have made a very decent , grave speaker . "
161365	161368	161370	161370	she	8764	" Yes , "
161372	161575	161370	161370	she	8764	" I solemnly vow , own , and confess , that I want a good husband . Where 's the harm of one ? My face is my fortune . Who 'll come ? buy , buy , buy ! I can not toil , neither can I spin , but I can play twenty - three games on the cards . I can dance the last dance , I can hunt the stag , and I think I could shoot flying . I can talk as wicked as any woman of my years , and know enough stories to amuse a sulky husband for at least one thousand and one nights . I have a pretty taste for dress , diamonds , gambling , and old China . I love sugar - plums , Malines lace that you brought me , cousin , is very pretty , the opera , and everything that is useless and costly . I have got a monkey and a little black boy Pompey , sir , go and give a dish of chocolate to Colonel Graveairs , and a parrot and a spaniel , and I must have a husband . Cupid , you hear ? "
161576	161581	161583	161583	Pompey	1057	" Iss , Missis ! "

162518	162688	162508	162508	Thyself	8809	" Jocasta is known as a woman of learning and fashion , and as one of the most amiable persons of this court and country . She is at home two mornings of the week , and all the wits and a few of the beauties of London flock to her assemblies . When she goes abroad to Tunbridge or the Bath , a retinue of adorers rides the journey with her ; and besides the London beaux , she has a crowd of admirers at the Wells , the polite amongst the natives of Sussex and Somerset pressing round her tea - tables , and being anxious for a nod from her chair . Jocasta 's acquaintance is thus very numerous . Indeed , ' tis one smart writer 's work to keep her visiting - book a strong footman is engaged to carry it ; and it would require a much stronger head even than Jocasta 's own to remember the names of all her dear friends . "
162893	163048	163055	163055	she	8818	" Jocasta was much flattered by beholding her admirer for that everybody admires who sees her is a point which she never can for a moment doubt in the next pew to her at St. James 's Church last Sunday ; and the manner in which he appeared to go to sleep during the sermon though from under his fringed eyelids it was evident he was casting glances of respectful rapture towards Jocasta deeply moved and interested her . On coming out of church , he found his way to her chair , and made her an elegant bow as she stepped into it . She saw him at Court afterwards , where he carried himself with a most distinguished air , though none of her acquaintances knew his name ; and the next night he was at the play , where her ladyship was pleased to acknowledge him from the side - box . "
163124	163210	163211	163211	Jocasta	1064	" He appeared on Tuesday , in a rich suit , showing a very fine taste both in the tailor and wearer ; and though a knot of us were gathered round the charming Jocasta , fellows who pretended to know every face upon the town , not one could tell the gentleman 's name in reply to Jocasta 's eager inquiries , flung to the right and left of her as he advanced up the room with a bow that would become a duke . "
163316	163376	163377	163378	The gentleman	1392	" ' Welcome to London , sir , ' says she . ' One can see you are from the country by your looks . ' She would have said ' Epsom , ' or ' Tunbridge , ' had she remembered rightly at which place she had met the stranger ; but , alas ! she had forgotten . "
163412	163427	163437	163438	the gentleman	1392	" She said , ' the waters had agreed with her but indifferently . ' "
163515	163560	163568	163568	she	11384	" Jocasta was an angel visiting the waters ; but at which of the Bethesdas ? She was puzzled more and more ; and , as her way always is , looked the more innocent and simple , the more artful her intentions were . "
163618	163655	163668	163668	she	11384	" ' Such an enchantress as your ladyship , ' says he , ' is mistress of all sorts of spells . ' But this was Dr. Swift 's pun , and we all knew it . "
163703	163742	163668	163668	she	11384	" ' Oh , madam , ' says he , ' I SPELL MY NAME WITH THE Y. ' And laying down his dish , my gentleman made another elegant bow , and was gone in a moment . "
163893	163894	163889	163890	your admirer	8843	" "
163903	163953	163889	163890	your admirer	8843	" MR . SPECTATOR , I am a gentleman but little acquainted with the town , though I have had a university education , and passed some years serving my country abroad , where my name is better known than in the coffee - house and St. James 's . "
164084	164295	164075	164076	Mr. Spectator	1073	" My table - book informs me that I danced no less than seven - and - twenty sets with her at the Assembly . I treated her to the fiddles twice . I was admitted on several days to her lodging , and received by her with a great deal of distinction , and , for a time , was entirely her slave . It was only when I found , from common talk of the company at the Wells , and from narrowly watching one , who I once thought of asking the most sacred question a man can put to a woman , that I became aware how unfit she was to be a country gentleman 's wife ; and that this fair creature was but a heartless worldly jilt , playing with affections that she never meant to return , and , indeed , incapable of returning them . ' Tis admiration such women want , not love that touches them ; and I can conceive , in her old age , no more wretched creature than this lady will be , when her beauty hath deserted her , when her admirers have left her , and she hath neither friendship nor religion to console her . "
164447	164528	164529	164529	Her	8859	" Having made her a promise to attend , of course I kept my promise ; and found the young widow in the midst of a half - dozen of card tables , and a crowd of wits and admirers . I made the best bow I could , and advanced towards her ; and saw by a peculiar puzzled look in her face , though she tried to hide her perplexity , that she had forgotten even my name . "
164628	164710	164621	164621	I	0	" Then she came to the question , which I knew was awaiting me , and asked how I SPELT my name ? ' Madam , ' says I , turning on my heel , ' I spell it with a Y. ' And so I left her , wondering at the light - heartedness of the town - people , who forget and make friends so easily , and resolved to look elsewhere for a partner for your constant reader , "
164714	164715	164711	164712	CYMON WYLDOATS	1083	" "
164767	164830	164831	164831	Cymon	1083	" The above is a parable , whereof the writer will now expound the meaning . Jocasta was no other than Miss Esmond , Maid of Honor to her Majesty . She had told Mr. Esmond this little story of having met a gentleman somewhere , and forgetting his name , when the gentleman , with no such malicious intentions as those of "
164832	164897	164759	164759	she	1381	" in the above fable , made the answer simply as above ; and we all laughed to think how little Mistress Jocasta - Beatrix had profited by her artifice and precautions . As for Cymon , he was intended to represent yours and her very humble servant , the writer of the apologue and of this story , which we had printed on a "
164899	165258	165261	165261	SHE	8867	" paper at Mr. Steele 's office , exactly as those famous journals were printed , and which was laid on the table at breakfast in place of the real newspaper . Mistress Jocasta , who had plenty of wit , could not live without her Spectator to her tea ; and this sham Spectator was intended to convey to the young woman that she herself was a flirt , and that Cymon was a gentleman of honor and resolution , seeing all her faults , and determined to break the chains once and for ever . For though enough hath been said about this love - business already enough , at least , to prove to the writer 's heirs what a silly fond fool their old grandfather was , who would like them to consider him as a very wise old gentleman ; yet not near all has been told concerning this matter , which , if it were allowed to take in Esmond 's journal the space it occupied in his time , would weary his kinsmen and women of a hundred years ' time beyond all endurance ; and form such a diary of folly and drivelling , raptures and rage , as no man of ordinary vanity would like to leave behind him . The truth is , that , whether she laughed at him or encouraged him ; whether she smiled or was cold , and turned her smiles on another ; worldly and ambitious , as he knew her to be ; hard and careless , as she seemed to grow with her court life , and a hundred admirers that came to her and left her ; Esmond , do what he would , never could get Beatrix out of his mind ; thought of her constantly at home or away . If he read his name in a Gazette , or escaped the shot of a cannon - ball or a greater danger in the campaign , as has happened to him more than once , the instant thought after the honor achieved or the danger avoided , was , "
165266	165267	165261	165261	SHE	8867	" "
165292	166432	165261	165261	SHE	8867	" He could no more help this passionate fidelity of temper than he could help the eyes he saw with one or the other seemed a part of his nature ; and knowing every one of her faults as well as the keenest of her detractors , and the folly of an attachment to such a woman , of which the fruition could never bring him happiness for above a week , there was yet a charm about this Circe from which the poor deluded gentleman could not free himself ; and for a much longer period than Ulysses another middle - aged officer , who had travelled much , and been in the foreign wars , Esmond felt himself enthralled and besotted by the wiles of this enchantress . Quit her ! He could no more quit her , as the Cymon of this story was made to quit his false one , than he could lose his consciousness of yesterday . She had but to raise her finger , and he would come back from ever so far ; she had but to say I have discarded such and such an adorer , and the poor infatuated wretch would be sure to come and roder about her mother 's house , willing to be put on the ranks of suitors , though he knew he might be cast off the next week . If he were like Ulysses in his folly , at least she was in so far like Penelope that she had a crowd of suitors , and undid day after day and night after night the handiwork of fascination and the web of coquetry with which she was wo nt to allure and entertain them . Part of her coquetry may have come from her position about the Court , where the beautiful maid of honor was the light about which a thousand beaux came and fluttered ; where she was sure to have a ring of admirers round her , crowding to listen to her repartees as much as to admire her beauty ; and where she spoke and listened to much free talk , such as one never would have thought the lips or ears of Rachel Castlewood 's daughter would have uttered or heard . When in waiting at Windsor or Hampton , the Court ladies and gentlemen would be making riding parties together ; Mrs. Beatrix in a horseman 's coat and hat , the foremost after the stag - hounds and over the park fences , a crowd of young fellows at her heels . If the English country ladies at this time were the most pure and modest of any ladies in the world the English town and court ladies permitted themselves words and behavior that were neither modest nor pure ; and claimed , some of them , a freedom which those who love that sex most would never wish to grant them . The gentlemen of my family that follow after me for I do n't encourage the ladies to pursue any such studies , may read in the works of Mr. Congreve , and Dr. Swift and others , what was the conversation and what the habits of our time . The most beautiful woman in England in 1712 , when Esmond returned to this country , a lady of high birth , and though of no fortune to be sure , with a thousand fascinations of wit and manners , Beatrix Esmond was now six - and - twenty years old , and Beatrix Esmond still . Of her hundred adorers she had not chosen one for a husband ; and those who had asked had been jilted by her ; and more still had left her . A succession of near ten years ' crops of beauties had come up since her time , and had been reaped by proper HUSBANDmen , if we may make an agricultural simile , and had been housed comfortably long ago . Her own contemporaries were sober mothers by this time ; girls with not a tithe of her charms , or her wit , having made good matches , and now claiming precedence over the spinster who but lately had derided and outshone them . The young beauties were beginning to look down on Beatrix as an old maid , and sneer , and call her one of Charles II . 's ladies , and ask whether her portrait was not in the Hampton Court Gallery ? But still she reigned , at least in one man 's opinion , superior over all the little misses that were the toasts of the young lads ; and in Esmond 's eyes was ever perfectly lovely and young . Who knows how many were nearly made happy by possessing her , or , rather , how many were fortunate in escaping this siren ? ' Tis a marvel to think that her mother was the purest and simplest woman in the whole world , and that this girl should have been born from her . I am inclined to fancy , my mistress , who never said a harsh word to her children and but twice or thrice only to one person , must have been too fond and pressing with the maternal authority ; for her son and her daughter both revolted early ; nor after their first flight from the nest could they ever be brought back quite to the fond mother 's bosom . Lady Castlewood , and perhaps it was as well , knew little of her daughter 's life and real thoughts . How was she to apprehend what passes in Queen 's ante - chambers and at Court tables ? Mrs. Beatrix asserted her own authority so resolutely that her mother quickly gave in . The maid of honor had her own equipage ; went from home and came back at her own will : her mother was alike powerless to resist her or to lead her , or to command or to persuade her . She had been engaged once , twice , thrice , to be married , Esmond believed . When he quitted home , it hath been said , she was promised to my Lord Ashburnham , and now , on his return , behold his lordship was just married to Lady Mary Butler , the Duke of Ormonde 's daughter , and his fine houses , and twelve thousand a year of fortune , for which Miss Beatrix had rather coveted him , was out of her power . To her Esmond could say nothing in regard to the breaking of this match ; and , asking his mistress about it , all Lady Castlewood answered was : "
166649	166885	166631	166647	a young woman that will make him a thousand times happier than my poor girl ever could	8874	" The rupture , whatever its cause was , I heard the scandal , but indeed shall not take pains to repeat at length in this diary the trumpery coffee - house story , caused a good deal of low talk ; and Mr. Esmond was present at my lord 's appearance at the Birthday with his bride , over whom the revenge that Beatrix took was to look so imperial and lovely that the modest downcast young lady could not appear beside her , and Lord Ashburnham , who had his reasons for wishing to avoid her , slunk away quite shamefaced , and very early . This time his Grace the Duke of Hamilton , whom Esmond had seen about her before , was constant at Miss Beatrix 's side : he was one of the most splendid gentlemen of Europe , accomplished by books , by travel , by long command of the best company , distinguished as a statesman , having been ambassador in King Williamn 's time , and a noble speaker in the Scots ' Parliament , where he had led the party that was against the Union , and though now five or six and forty years of age , a gentleman so high in stature , accomplished in wit , and favored in person , that he might pretend to the hand of any Princess in Europe . "
166895	166909	166913	166914	the widower	8879	" says Mr. Secretary St. John , whispering to Colonel Esmond in French ; "
166918	166955	166916	166916	himself	8879	" But to return to our little Spectator paper and the conversation which grew out of it . Miss Beatrix at first was quite BIT as the phrase of that day was and did not ' smoke "
167077	167086	167088	167089	Miss Beatrix	1064	" How stupid your friend Mr. Steele becomes ! "
167091	167139	167088	167089	Miss Beatrix	1064	" Epsom and Tunbridge ! Will he never have done with Epsom and Tunbridge , and with beaux at church , and Jocastas and Lindamiras ? Why does he not call women Nelly and Betty , as their godfathers and godmothers did for them in their baptism ? "
167140	167145	167147	167148	her mother	11361	" Beatrix . Beatrix ! "
167157	167158	167147	167148	her mother	11361	" "
167171	167179	167168	167168	I	0	" says Beatrix , with a laugh , "
167220	167221	167215	167215	you	11270	" "
167230	167236	167222	167222	I	0	" says her mother blushing . "
167245	167254	167222	167222	I	0	" said somebody else . Beatrix went on reading "
167266	167276	167277	167277	you	11270	" says she , turning round to Colonel Esmond , "
167305	167325	167303	167303	sir	1424	" Poor Mr. Esmond felt rather frightened , and told a truth , which was nevertheless an entire falsehood . "
167330	167334	167303	167303	sir	1424	" says he , "
167346	167380	167340	167344	the Spectator of this morning	8893	" Nor had he , for that was not the Spectator , but a sham newspaper put in its place . She went on reading : her face rather flushed as she read . "
167383	167387	167340	167344	the Spectator of this morning	8893	" she says , "
167468	167469	167470	167470	Beatrix	1064	" "
167472	167478	167481	167481	mamma	11270	" cries the Lady Castlewood . "
167576	167614	167617	167617	sir	1424	" And with this the young lady lays aside her paper , and runs up to her mother and performs a variety of embraces with her ladyship , saying as plain as eyes could speak to Mr. Esmond "
167631	167632	167621	167621	YOU	1424	" "
167640	167644	167637	167637	I	0	" says he . "
167648	167653	167655	167655	you	11270	" asked Miss Beatrix . "
167667	167671	167655	167655	you	11270	" answers Esmond . "
167676	167684	167658	167658	you	11270	" cries Beatrix , with a laugh . "
167695	167726	167688	167688	Henry	427	" asks her mother , the kind soul , who was always thinking what we would like , and how she could please us . The girl runs up to her "
167734	167742	167729	167729	you	11270	" she says , kissing her again , "
167750	167773	167746	167746	Harry	427	" and she broke out into a great joyful laugh ; and Lady Castlewood blushed as bashful as a maid of sixteen . "
167780	167795	167778	167778	Harry	427	" whispers Beatrix , running up , and speaking in her sweet low tones . "
167828	167844	167819	167819	she	8907	" Esmond 's kind mistress left the room , carrying her blushes away with her . "
167857	167865	167819	167819	she	8907	" continues Beatrix , with her laugh , "
167902	167928	167900	167900	Henry	427	" She paused for a minute , and the smile fading away from her April face , gave place to a menacing shower of tears ; "
167938	167945	167936	167936	Harry	427	" Beatrix went on to say . "
168037	168038	168011	168011	She	8907	" "
168046	168051	168011	168011	She	8907	" says Mr. Esmond . "
168056	168070	168011	168011	She	8907	" Beatrix went on , without noticing this interruption except by a look , "
168227	168234	168223	168225	that guardian angel	8929	" here broke out Mistress Beatrix . "
168514	168515	168518	168518	Beatrix	1064	" "
168520	168525	168518	168518	Beatrix	1064	" says Mr. Esmond . "
168566	168579	168557	168557	We	8942	" says poor Beatrix , her fair breast heaving with a sigh . "
168594	168599	168582	168582	I	0	" says Mr. Esmond . "
168674	168675	168692	168692	Lubin	1091	" "
168684	168688	168692	168692	Lubin	1091	" says Beatrix . "
168694	168695	168692	168692	Lubin	1091	" "
168706	168714	168696	168696	I	0	" answers Esmond , with a blush ; "
168797	168798	168790	168790	Jacob	713	" "
168802	168806	168800	168800	mamma	11270	" says Beatrix . "
168826	168831	168832	168832	I	0	" Esmond blushed again . "
168876	168877	168870	168870	you	0	" "
168896	168897	168889	168889	I	0	" "
169023	169024	168995	168995	We	8962	" "
169031	169035	168995	168995	We	8962	" cries Beatrix . "
169059	169083	169086	169086	I	0	" And she flung back her curls , and looked over her fair shoulder at the mirror superbly , as if she said , "
169090	169091	169086	169086	I	0	" "
169094	169114	169086	169086	I	0	" says Esmond , who had the art , as she owned , of divining many of her thoughts . "
169402	169403	169406	169406	you	0	" "
169412	169423	169406	169406	you	0	" says Miss Beatrix , looking with her great eyes . "
169429	169476	169406	169406	you	0	" says Esmond . And , indeed , the scheme had been dwelling a good deal in his mind for some time past , and especially since his return home , when he found how hopeless , and even degrading to himself , his passion was . "
169479	169485	169486	169486	I	0	" says he , then : "
169511	169521	169523	169523	I	0	" another low curtsy on Mistress Beatrix 's part , "
169556	169557	169558	169559	Mon ami	8989	" "
169561	169580	169581	169581	you	8989	" she says quite kindly , and taking Esmond 's hand , with an air of great compassion , "
169672	169688	169670	169670	sir	1424	" And she put her face quite close to his who knows with what intention ? "
169694	169701	169702	169702	I	0	" says Esmond , turning away . "
169747	169875	169877	169877	she	8996	" Here the servant , flinging the door open , announced his Grace the Duke of Hamilton , and Esmond started back with something like an imprecation on his lips , as the nobleman entered , looking splendid in his star and green ribbon . He gave Mr. Esmond just that gracious bow which he would have given to a lackey who fetched him a chair or took his hat , and seated himself by Miss Beatrix , as the poor Colonel went out of the room with a hang - dog look . Esmond 's mistress was in the lower room as he passed down stairs . She often met him as he was coming away from Beatrix ; and she beckoned him into the apartment . "
169883	169888	169889	169889	She	8996	" Lady Castlewood said . "
169896	169900	169877	169877	she	8996	" says Esmond . "
169910	169911	169889	169889	She	8996	" "
169918	169926	169889	169889	She	8996	" says he , his heart beating . "
169938	169943	169944	169944	He	427	" says my lady . "
169980	169980	169974	169975	the Ambassadress	1095	"
170348	170358	170340	170340	he	1097	" he was sure he could not keep it ; "
170714	170749	170708	170708	she	5108	" Such a subject as the Duke of Hamilton has a pre - eminent claim to every mark of distinction which a crowned head can confer . I will henceforth wear both orders myself . "
171237	171241	171243	171243	Tom	442	" This bankruptcy , "
171245	171357	171243	171243	Tom	442	" has been hanging over my head these three years ; the thought hath prevented my sleeping , and I have looked at poor Polly 's head on t'other pillow , and then towards my razor on the table , and thought to put an end to myself , and so give my woes the slip . But now we are bankrupts : Tom Trett pays as many shillings in the pound as he can ; his wife has a little cottage at Fulham , and her fortune secured to herself . I am afraid neither of bailiff nor of creditor : and for the last six nights have slept easy . "
171441	171458	171460	171460	she	837	" Is this the way , sir , that you receive the announcement of your misfortune , "
171462	171481	171460	171460	she	837	" and do you come smiling before me as if you were glad to be rid of me ? "
171506	171518	171520	171520	he	427	" I have been hankering after the grapes on the wall , "
171522	171559	171520	171520	he	427	" and lost my temper because they were beyond my reach ; was there any wonder ? They 're gone now , and another has them a taller man than your humble servant has won them . "
171570	171578	171580	171580	she	837	" A taller man , Cousin Esmond ! "
171582	171614	171580	171580	she	837	" A man of spirit would have sealed the wall , sir , and seized them ! A man of courage would have fought for 'em , not gaped for 'em . "
171615	171629	171631	171631	Esmond	1049	" A Duke has but to gape and they drop into his mouth , "
171638	171643	171645	171645	she	837	" Yes , sir , "
171647	172111	171645	171645	she	837	" a Duke IS a taller man than you . And why should I not be grateful to one such as his Grace , who gives me his heart and his great name ? It is a great gift he honors me with ; I know ' tis a bargain between us ; and I accept it , and will do my utmost to perform my part of it . ' Tis no question of sighing and philandering between a noble man of his Grace 's age and a girl who hath little of that softness in her nature . Why should I not own that I am ambitious , Harry Esmond ; and if it be no sin in a man to covet honor , why should a woman too not desire it ? Shall I be frank with you , Harry , and say that if you had not been down on your knees , and so humble , you might have fared better with me ? A woman of my spirit , cousin , is to be won by gallantry , and not by sighs and rueful faces . All the time you are worshipping and singing hymns to me , I know very well I am no goddess , and grow weary of the incense . So would you have been weary of the goddess too when she was called Mrs. Esmond , and got out of humor because she had not pin - money enough , and was forced to go about in an old gown . Eh ! cousin , a goddess in a mob - cap , that has to make her husband 's gruel , ceases to be divine I am sure of it . I should have been sulky and scolded ; and of all the proud wretches in the world Mr. Esmond is the proudest , let me tell him that . You never fall into a passion ; but you never forgive , I think . Had you been a great man , you might have been good - humored ; but being nobody , sir , you are too great a man for me ; and I 'm afraid of you , cousin there ! and I wo n't worship you , and you 'll never be happy except with a woman who will . Why , after I belonged to you , and after one of my tantrums , you would have put the pillow over my head some night , and smothered me , as the black man does the woman in the play that you 're so fond of . What 's the creature 's name ? Desdemona . You would , you little black - dyed Othello ! "
172112	172120	172122	172123	the Colonel	2816	" I think I should , Beatrix , "
172125	172404	172122	172123	the Colonel	2816	" And I want no such ending . I intend to live to be a hundred , and to go to ten thousand routs and balls , and to play cards every night of my life till the year eighteen hundred . And I like to be the first of my company , sir ; and I like flattery and compliments , and you give me none ; and I like to be made to laugh , sir , and who 's to laugh at YOUR dismal face , I should like to know ? and I like a coach - and six or a coach - and - eight ; and I like diamonds , and a new gown every week ; and people to say ' That 's the Duchess How well her Grace looks Make way for Madame l'Ambassadrice d'Angleterre Call her Excellency 's people ' that 's what I like . And as for you , you want a woman to bring your slippers and cap , and to sit at your feet , and cry , ' O caro ! O bravo ! ' whilst you read your Shakespeares and Miltons and stuff . Mamma would have been the wife for you , had you been a little older , though you look ten years older than she does you do , you glum - faced , blue - bearded little old man ! You might have sat , like Darby and Joan , and flattered each other ; and billed and cooed like a pair of old pigeons on a perch . I want my wings and to use them , sir . "
172423	172426	172406	172406	she	9100	" Gawrie , "
172437	172449	172451	172451	Esmond	837	" And what will your Peter Wilkins say to your flight ? "
172469	172476	172478	172478	she	9100	" A duchess knows her place , "
172484	172658	172478	172478	she	9100	" Why , I have a son already made for me , and thirty years old my Lord Arran , and four daughters . How they will scold , and what a rage they will be in , when I come to take the head of the table ! But I give them only a month to be angry ; at the end of that time they shall love me every one , and so shall Lord Arran , and so shall all his Grace 's Scots vassals and followers in the Highlands . I 'm bent on it ; and when I take a thing in my head , ' tis done . His Grace is the greatest gentleman in Europe , and I 'll try and make him happy ; and , when the King comes back , you may count on my protection , Cousin Esmond for come back the King will and shall ; and I 'll bring him back from Versailles , if he comes under my hoop . "
172659	172671	172673	172673	Esmond	837	" I hope the world will make you happy , Beatrix , "
172679	172705	172673	172673	Esmond	837	" You 'll be Beatrix till you are my Lady Duchess will you not ? I shall then make your Grace my very lowest bow . "
172706	172717	172718	172718	she	837	" None of these sighs and this satire , cousin , "
172721	172831	172718	172718	she	837	" I take his Grace 's great bounty thankfully yes , thankfully ; and will wear his honors becomingly . I do not say he hath touched my heart ; but he has my gratitude , obedience , admiration I have told him that , and no more ; and with that his noble heart is content . I have told him all even the story of that poor creature that I was engaged to and that I could not love ; and I gladly gave his word back to him , and jumped for joy to get back my own . I am twenty - five years old . "
172832	172840	172842	172842	Esmond	837	" Twenty - six , my dear , "
172844	173151	173153	173153	she	9103	" Twenty - five , sir I choose to be twenty - five ; and in eight years no man hath ever touched my heart . Yes you did once , for a little , Harry , when you came back after Lille , and engaging with that murderer Mohun , and saving Frank 's life . I thought I could like you ; and mamma begged me hard , on her knees , and I did for a day . But the old chill came over me , Henry , and the old fear of you and your melancholy ; and I was glad when you went away , and engaged with my Lord Ashburnham , that I might hear no more of you , that 's the truth . You are too good for me , somehow . I could not make you happy , and should break my heart in trying , and not being able to love you . But if you had asked me when we gave you the sword , you might have had me , sir , and we both should have been miserable by this time . I talked with that silly lord all night just to vex you and mamma , and I succeeded , did n't I ? How frankly we can talk of these things ! It seems a thousand years ago : and , though we are here sitting in the same room , there is a great wall between us . My dear , kind , faithful , gloomy old cousin ! I can like now , and admire you too , sir , and say that you are brave , and very kind , and very true , and a fine gentleman for all for all your little mishap at your birth , "
173160	173166	173168	173168	she	9103	" And now , sir , "
173174	173216	173168	173168	she	9103	" we must have no more talk except when mamma is by , as his Grace is with us ; for he does not half like you , cousin , and is jealous as the black man in your favorite play . "
173270	173295	173264	173264	himself	427	" The interview must not end yet , my dear , until I have had my last word . Stay , here comes your mother "
173316	173441	173443	173443	he	9104	" My dear lady may hear , too , the last words , which are no secrets , and are only a parting benediction accompanying a present for your marriage from an old gentleman your guardian ; for I feel as if I was the guardian of all the family , and an old old fellow that is fit to be the grandfather of you all ; and in this character let me make my Lady Duchess her wedding present . They are the diamonds my father 's widow left me . I had thought Beatrix might have had them a year ago ; but they are good enough for a duchess , though not bright enough for the handsomest woman in the world . "
173661	173668	173670	173671	Mistress Beatrix	1064	" Look , my Lord Duke , "
173685	173688	173690	173691	his Grace	13211	" Diamonds , "
173693	173700	173690	173691	his Grace	13211	" Hm ! they seem pretty . "
173701	173710	173712	173712	Beatrix	1064	" They are a present on my marriage , "
173714	173719	173721	173722	the Duke	1572	" From her Majesty ? "
173724	173731	173721	173722	the Duke	1572	" The Queen is very good . "
173732	173741	173744	173745	the ladies	11896	" From my cousin Henry from our cousin Henry "
173750	173783	173744	173745	the ladies	11896	" I have not the honor of knowing the gentleman . I thought that my Lord Castlewood had no brother : and that on your ladyship 's side there were no nephews . "
173784	173796	173798	173798	Beatrix	1064	" From our cousin , Colonel Henry Esmond , my lord , "
173808	173834	173798	173798	Beatrix	1064	" who was left guardian to us by our father , and who has a hundred times shown his love and friendship for our family . "
173835	173850	173852	173853	the Duke	1572	" The Duchess of Hamilton receives no diamonds but from her husband , madam , "
173854	173866	173798	173798	Beatrix	1064	" may I pray you to restore these to Mr. Esmond ? "
173867	173884	173886	173887	Lady Castlewood	494	" Beatrix Esmond may receive a present from our kinsman and benefactor , my Lord Duke , "
173896	173920	173886	173887	Lady Castlewood	494	" She is my daughter yet : and if her mother sanctions the gift no one else hath the right to question it . "
173921	173926	173928	173929	the Duke	1572	" Kinsman and benefactor ! "
173931	173951	173928	173929	the Duke	1572	" I know of no kinsman : and I do not choose that my wife should have for benefactor a "
173952	173956	173958	173959	Colonel Esmond	1107	" My lord ! "
173961	173970	173972	173973	his Grace	13211	" I am not here to bandy words , "
173975	174013	173972	173973	his Grace	13211	" frankly I tell you that your visits to this house are too frequent , and that I choose no presents for the Duchess of Hamilton from gentlemen that bear a name they have no right to . "
174014	174018	174021	174022	Lady Castlewood	494	" My lord ! "
174024	174054	174021	174022	Lady Castlewood	494	" Mr. Esmond hath the best right to that name of any man in the world : and ' tis as old and as honorable as your Grace 's . "
174076	174083	174085	174086	my mistress	11551	" If I called him benefactor , "
174088	174146	174085	174086	my mistress	11551	" it is because he has been so to us yes , the noblest , the truest , the bravest , the dearest of benefactors . He would have saved my husband 's life from Mohun 's sword . He did save my boy 's , and defended him from that villain . Are those no benefits ? "
174147	174155	174157	174158	his Grace	13211	" I ask Colonel Esmond 's pardon , "
174167	174231	174157	174158	his Grace	13211	" I would say not a word that should give him offence , and thank him for his kindness to your ladyship 's family . My Lord Mohun and I are connected , you know , by marriage though neither by blood nor friendship ; but I must repeat what I said , that my wife can receive no presents from Colonel Esmond . "
174232	174280	174282	174283	Lady Esmond	598	" My daughter may receive presents from the Head of our House : my daughter may thankfully take kindness from her father 's , her mother 's , her brother 's dearest friend ; and be grateful for one more benefit besides the thousand we owe him , "
174285	174324	174326	174327	my mistress	11551	" What is a string of diamond stones compared to that affection he hath given us our dearest preserver and benefactor ? We owe him not only Frank 's life , but our all yes , our all , "
174338	174480	174326	174327	my mistress	11551	" The title we bear is his , if he would claim it . ' Tis we who have no right to our name : not he that 's too great for it . He sacrificed his name at my dying lord 's bedside sacrificed it to my orphan children ; gave up rank and honor because he loved us so nobly . His father was Viscount of Castlewood and Marquis of Esmond before him ; and he is his father 's lawful son and true heir , and we are the recipients of his bounty , and he the chief of a house that 's as old as your own . And if he is content to forego his name that my child may bear it , we love him and honor him and bless him under whatever name he bears "
174523	174530	174502	174502	Beatrix	837	" Mother , what is this ? "
174531	174542	174544	174545	Colonel Esmond	979	" ' Tis a family secret , my Lord Duke , "
174547	174586	174544	174545	Colonel Esmond	979	" poor Beatrix knew nothing of it ; nor did my lady till a year ago . And I have as good a right to resign my title as your Grace 's mother to abdicate hers to you . "
174587	174599	174681	174681	her	11551	" I should have told everything to the Duke of Hamilton , "
174604	174677	174681	174681	her	11551	" had his Grace applied to me for my daughter 's hand , and not to Beatrix . I should have spoken with you this very day in private , my lord , had not your words brought about this sudden explanation and now ' tis fit Beatrix should hear it ; and know , as I would have all the world know , what we owe to our kinsman and patron . "
174768	174777	174779	174780	his Grace	13211	" And Marquis of Esmond , my lord , "
174787	174832	174779	174780	his Grace	13211	" Permit me to ask your lordship 's pardon for words that were uttered in ignorance ; and to beg for the favor of your friendship . To be allied to you , sir , must be an honor under whatever name you are known "
174841	174904	174906	174907	the Duke	1572	" and in return for the splendid present you make my wife , your kinswoman , I hope you will please to command any service that James Douglas can perform . I shall never be easy until I repay you a part of my obligations at least ; and ere very long , and with the mission her Majesty hath given me , "
174909	174938	174906	174907	the Duke	1572	" that may perhaps be in my power . I shall esteem it as a favor , my lord , if Colonel Esmond will give away the bride . "
174939	174955	174957	174957	Beatrix	837	" And if he will take the usual payment in advance , he is welcome , "
174974	174985	174971	174971	she	837	" Oh , why did n't I know you before ? "
175021	175030	175032	175033	Colonel Esmond	979	" When does your Excellency go for Paris ? "
175035	175045	175046	175046	his	1572	" As soon after the ceremony as may be , "
175050	175131	175046	175047	his Grace	13211	" ' Tis fixed for the first of December : it can not be sooner . The equipage will not be ready till then . The Queen intends the embassy should be very grand and I have law business to settle . That ill - omened Mohun has come , or is coming , to London again : we are in a lawsuit about my late Lord Gerard 's property ; and he hath sent to me to meet him . "
175531	175536	175538	175538	Webb	439	" Ah , ah ! "
175571	175911	175564	175564	I	0	" Our enemy Cardonnel was turned out of the House of Commons along with Mr. Walpole for malversation of public money . Cadogan lost his place of Lieutenant of the Tower . Marlborough 's daughters resigned their posts of ladies of the bedchamber ; and so complete was the Duke 's disgrace , that his son - in - law , Lord Bridgewater , was absolutely obliged to give up his lodgings at St. James 's , and had his half - pension , as Master of the Horse , taken away . But I think the lowest depth of Marlborough 's fall was when he humbly sent to ask General Webb when he might wait upon him ; he who had commanded the stout old General , who had injured him and sneered at him , who had kept him dangling in his ante - chamber , who could not even after his great service condescend to write him a letter in his own hand . The nation was as eager for peace as ever it had been hot for war . The Prince of Savoy came amongst us , had his audience of the Queen , and got his famous Sword of Honor , and strove with all his force to form a Whig party together , to bring over the young Prince of Hanover to do anything which might prolong the war , and consummate the ruin of the old sovereign whom he hated so implacably . But the nation was tired of the struggle : so completely wearied of it that not even our defeat at Denain could rouse us into any anger , though such an action so lost two years before would have set all England in a fury . ' Twas easy to see that the great Marlborough was not with the army . Eugene was obliged to fall back in a rage , and forego the dazzling revenge of his life . ' Twas in vain the Duke 's side asked , "
175935	177075	175926	175933	the only champion who could repair our honor	9166	" The nation had had its bellyful of fighting ; nor could taunts or outcries goad up our Britons any more . For a statesman that was always prating of liberty , and had the grandest philosophic maxims in his mouth , it must be owned that Mr. St. John sometimes rather acted like a Turkish than a Greek philosopher , and especially fell foul of one unfortunate set of men , the men of letters , with a tyranny a little extraordinary in a man who professed to respect their calling so much . The literary controversy at this time was very bitter , the Government side was the winning one , the popular one , and I think might have been the merciful one . ' Twas natural that the opposition should be peevish and cry out : some men did so from their hearts , admiring the Duke of Marlborough 's prodigious talents , and deploring the disgrace of the greatest general the world ever knew : ' twas the stomach that caused other patriots to grumble , and such men cried out because they were poor , and paid to do so . Against these my Lord Bolingbroke never showed the slightest mercy , whipping a dozen into prison or into the pillory without the least commiseration . From having been a man of arms Mr. Esmond had now come to be a man of letters , but on a safer side than that in which the above - cited poor fellows ventured their liberties and ears . There was no danger on ours , which was the winning side ; besides , Mr. Esmond pleased himself by thinking that he writ like a gentleman if he did not always succeed as a wit . Of the famous wits of that age , who have rendered Queen Anne 's reign illustrious , and whose works will be in all Englishmen 's hands in ages yet to come , Mr. Esmond saw many , but at public places chiefly ; never having a great intimacy with any of them , except with honest Dick Steele and Mr. Addison , who parted company with Esmond , however , when that gentleman became a declared Tory , and lived on close terms with the leading persons of that party . Addison kept himself to a few friends , and very rarely opened himself except in their company . A man more upright and conscientious than he it was not possible to find in public life , and one whose conversation was so various , easy , and delightful . Writing now in my mature years , I own that I think Addison 's politics were the right , and were my time to come over again , I would be a Whig in England and not a Tory ; but with people that take a side in politics , ' tis men rather than principles that commonly bind them . A kindness or a slight puts a man under one flag or the other , and he marches with it to the end of the campaign . Esmond 's master in war was injured by Marlborough , and hated him : and the lieutenant fought the quarrels of his leader . Webb coming to London was used as a weapon by Marlborough 's enemies and true steel he was , that honest chief ; nor was his aide - de - camp , Mr. Esmond , an unfaithful or unworthy partisan . ' Tis strange here , and on a foreign soil , and in a land that is independent in all but the name , for that the North American colonies shall remain dependants on yonder little island for twenty years more , I never can think , to remember how the nation at home seemed to give itself up to the domination of one or other aristocratic party , and took a Hanoverian king , or a French one , according as either prevailed . And while the Tories , the October club gentlemen , the High Church parsons that held by the Church of England , were for having a Papist king , for whom many of their Scottish and English leaders , firm churchmen all , laid down their lives with admirable loyalty and devotion ; they were governed by men who had notoriously no religion at all , but used it as they would use any opinion for the purpose of forwarding their own ambition . The Whigs , on the other hand , who professed attachment to religion and liberty too , were compelled to send to Holland or Hanover for a monarch around whom they could rally . A strange series of compromises is that English History ; compromise of principle , compromise of party , compromise of worship ! The lovers of English freedom and independence submitted their religious consciences to an Act of Parliament ; could not consolidate their liberty without sending to Zell or the Hague for a king to live under ; and could not find amongst the proudest people in the world a man speaking their own language , and understanding their laws , to govern them . The Tory and High Church patriots were ready to die in defence of a Papist family that had sold us to France ; the great Whig nobles , the sturdy republican recusants who had cut off Charles Stuart 's head for treason , were fain to accept a king whose title came to him through a royal grandmother , whose own royal grandmother 's head had fallen under Queen Bess 's hatchet . And our proud English nobles sent to a petty German town for a monarch to come and reign in London and our prelates kissed the ugly hands of his Dutch mistresses , and thought it no dishonor . In England you can but belong to one party or t'other , and you take the house you live in with all its encumbrances , its retainers , its antique discomforts , and ruins even ; you patch up , but you never build up anew . Will we of the new world submit much longer , even nominally , to this ancient British superstition ? There are signs of the times which make me think that ere long we shall care as little about King George here , and peers temporal and peers spiritual , as we do for King Canute or the Druids . This chapter began about the wits , my grandson may say , and hath wandered very far from their company . The pleasantest of the wits I knew were the Doctors Garth and Arbuthnot , and Mr. Gay , the author of "
177078	177291	175926	175933	the only champion who could repair our honor	9166	" the most charming kind soul that ever laughed at a joke or cracked a bottle . Mr. Prior I saw , and he was the earthen pot swimming with the pots of brass down the stream , and always and justly frightened lest he should break in the voyage . I met him both at London and Paris , where he was performing piteous congees to the Duke of Shrewsbury , not having courage to support the dignity which his undeniable genius and talent had won him , and writing coaxing letters to Secretary St. John , and thinking about his plate and his place , and what on earth should become of him should his party go out . The famous Mr. Congreve I saw a dozen of times at Button 's , a splendid wreck of a man , magnificently attired , and though gouty , and almost blind , bearing a brave face against fortune . The great Mr. Pope of whose prodigious genius I have no words to express my admiration was quite a puny lad at this time , appearing seldom in public places . There were hundreds of men , wits , and pretty fellows frequenting the theatres and coffee - houses of that day whom "
177297	177372	175926	175933	the only champion who could repair our honor	9166	" Indeed I think the most brilliant of that sort I ever saw was not till fifteen years afterwards , when I paid my last visit in England , and met young Harry Fielding , son of the Fielding that served in Spain and afterwards in Flanders with us , and who for fun and humor seemed to top them all . As for the famous Dr. Swift , I can say of him , "
177376	178405	175926	175933	the only champion who could repair our honor	9166	" He was in London all these years up to the death of the Queen ; and in a hundred public places where I saw him , but no more ; he never missed Court of a Sunday , where once or twice he was pointed out to your grandfather . He would have sought me out eagerly enough had I been a great man with a title to my name , or a star on my coat . At Court the Doctor had no eyes but for the very greatest . Lord Treasurer and St. John used to call him Jonathan , and they paid him with this cheap coin for the service they took of him . He writ their lampoons , fought their enemies , flogged and bullied in their service , and it must be owned with a consummate skill and fierceness . ' Tis said he hath lost his intellect now , and forgotten his wrongs and his rage against mankind . I have always thought of him and of Marlborough as the two greatest men of that age . I have read his books who doth not know them ? here in our calm woods , and imagine a giant to myself as I think of him , a lonely fallen Prometheus , groaning as the vulture tears him . Prometheus I saw , but when first I ever had any words with him , the giant stepped out of a sedan chair in the Poultry , whither he had come with a tipsy Irish servant parading before him , who announced him , bawling out his Reverence 's name , whilst his master below was as yet haggling with the chairman . I disliked this Mr. Swift , and heard many a story about him , of his conduct to men , and his words to women . He could flatter the great as much as he could bully the weak ; and Mr. Esmond , being younger and hotter in that day than now , was determined , should he ever meet this dragon , not to run away from his teeth and his fire . Men have all sorts of motives which carry them onwards in life , and are driven into acts of desperation , or it may be of distinction , from a hundred different causes . There was one comrade of Esmond 's , an honest little Irish lieutenant of Handyside 's , who owed so much money to a camp sutler , that he began to make love to the man 's daughter , intending to pay his debt that way ; and at the battle of Malplaquet , flying away from the debt and lady too , he rushed so desperately on the French lines , that he got his company ; and came a captain out of the action , and had to marry the sutler 's daughter after all , who brought him his cancelled debt to her father as poor Roger 's fortune . To run out of the reach of bill and marriage , he ran on the enemy 's pikes ; and as these did not kill him he was thrown back upon t'other horn of his dilemma . Our great Duke at the same battle was fighting , not the French , but the Tories in England ; and risking his life and the army 's , not for his country but for his pay and places ; and for fear of his wife at home , that only being in life whom he dreaded . I have asked about men in my own company , new drafts of poor country boys were perpetually coming over to us during the wars , and brought from the ploughshare to the sword , and found that a half of them under the flags were driven thither on account of a woman : one fellow was jilted by his mistress and took the shilling in despair ; another jilted the girl , and fled from her and the parish to the tents where the law could not disturb him . Why go on particularizing ? What can the sons of Adam and Eve expect , but to continue in that course of love and trouble their father and mother set out on ? Oh , my grandson ! I am drawing nigh to the end of that period of my history , when I was acquainted with the great world of England and Europe ; my years are past the Hebrew poet 's limit , and I say unto thee , all my troubles and joys too , for that matter , have come from a woman ; as thine will when thy destined course begins . ' Twas a woman that made a soldier of me , that set me intriguing afterwards ; I believe I would have spun smocks for her had she so bidden me ; what strength I had in my head I would have given her ; hath not every man in his degree had his Omphale and Delilah ? Mine befooled me on the banks of the Thames , and in dear old England ; thou mayest find thine own by Rappahannock . To please that woman then I tried to distinguish myself as a soldier , and afterwards as a wit and a politician ; as to please another I would have put on a black cassock and a pair of bands , and had done so but that a superior fate intervened to defeat that project . And I say , I think the world is like Captain Esmond 's company I spoke of anon ; and could you see every man 's career in life , you would find a woman clogging him ; or clinging round his march and stopping him ; or cheering him and goading him : or beckoning him out of her chariot , so that he goes up to her , and leaves the race to be run without him or bringing him the apple , and saying "

178496	178836	178936	178937	a contributor	9170	" he was enabled to do good service for that cause which he embarked in , and for Mr. St. John and his party . But he disdained the abuse in which some of the Tory writers indulged ; for instance , Dr. Swift , who actually chose to doubt the Duke of Marlborough 's courage , and was pleased to hint that his Grace 's military capacity was doubtful : nor were Esmond 's performances worse for the effect they were intended to produce , though no doubt they could not injure the Duke of Marlborough nearly so much in the public eyes as the malignant attacks of Swift did , which were carefully directed so as to blacken and degrade him , because they were writ openly and fairly by Mr. Esmond , who made no disguise of them , who was now out of the army , and who never attacked the prodigious courage and talents , only the selfishness and rapacity , of the chief . The Colonel then , having writ a paper for one of the Tory journals , called the Post - Boy , a letter upon Bouchain , that the town talked about for two whole days , when the appearance of an Italian singer supplied a fresh subject for conversation , and having business at the Exchange , where Mistress Beatrix wanted a pair of gloves or a fan very likely , Esmond went to correct his paper , and was sitting at the printer 's , when the famous Doctor Swift came in , his Irish fellow with him that used to walk before his chair , and bawled out his master 's name with great dignity . Mr. Esmond was waiting for the printer too , whose wife had gone to the tavern to fetch him , and was meantime engaged in drawing a picture of a soldier on horseback for a dirty little pretty boy of the printer 's wife , whom she had left behind her . "
178851	178932	178849	178849	sir	1424	" says the Doctor , in a grating voice that had an Irish twang ; and he looked at the Colonel from under his two bushy eyebrows with a pair of very clear blue eyes . His complexion was muddy , his figure rather fat , his chin double . He wore a shabby cassock , and a shabby hat over his black wig , and he pulled out a great gold watch , at which he looks very fierce . "
178942	178974	178939	178940	Doctor Swift	1124	" says Esmond , with the little boy still on his knee . He was sitting with his back in the window , so that the Doctor could not see him . "
178983	178994	178980	178981	Dr. Swift	664	" says the Doctor , eying the other very haughtily . "

179127	179132	179125	179125	sir	1424	" says the Doctor . "

179643	180268	179640	179641	Mr. Kemp	1129	" Poor Kemp , who had been a lieutenant at the beginning of the war , and fallen into misfortune , was the writer of the Post - Boy , and now took honest Mr. Leach 's pay in place of her Majesty 's . Esmond had seen this gentleman , and a very ingenious , hardworking honest fellow he was , toiling to give bread to a great family , and watching up many a long winter night to keep the wolf from his door . And Mr. St. John , who had liberty always on his tongue , had just sent a dozen of the opposition writers into prison , and one actually into the pillory , for what he called libels , but libels not half so violent as those writ on our side . With regard to this very piece of tyranny , Esmond had remonstrated strongly with the Secretary , who laughed and said the rascals were served quite right ; and told Esmond a joke of Swift 's regarding the matter . Nay , more , this Irishman , when St. John was about to pardon a poor wretch condemned to death for rape , absolutely prevented the Secretary from exercising this act of good - nature , and boasted that he had had the man hanged ; and great as the Doctor 's genius might be , and splendid his ability , Esmond for one would affect no love for him , and never desired to make his acquaintance . The Doctor was at Court every Sunday assiduously enough , a place the Colonel frequented but rarely , though he had a great inducement to go there in the person of a fair maid of honor of her Majesty 's ; and the airs and patronage Mr. Swift gave himself , forgetting gentlemen of his country whom he knew perfectly , his loud talk at once insolent and servile , nay , perhaps his very intimacy with Lord Treasurer and the Secretary , who indulged all his freaks and called him Jonathan , you may be sure , were remarked by many a person of whom the proud priest himself took no note , during that time of his vanity and triumph . ' Twas but three days after the 15th of November , 1712 Esmond minds him well of the date , that he went by invitation to dine with his General , the foot of whose table he used to take on these festive occasions , as he had done at many a board , hard and plentiful , during the campaign . This was a great feast , and of the latter sort ; the honest old gentleman loved to treat his friends splendidly : his Grace of Ormonde , before he joined his army as generalissimo , my Lord Viscount Bolingbroke , one of her Majesty 's Secretaries of State , my Lord Orkney , that had served with us abroad , being of the party . His Grace of Hamilton , Master of the Ordnance , and in whose honor the feast had been given , upon his approaching departure as Ambassador to Paris , had sent an excuse to General Webb at two o'clock , but an hour before the dinner : nothing but the most immediate business , his Grace said , should have prevented him having the pleasure of drinking a parting glass to the health of General Webb . His absence disappointed Esmond 's old chief , who suffered much from his wounds besides ; and though the company was grand , it was rather gloomy . St. John came last , and brought a friend with him : "
180273	180282	180269	180269	I	0	" says my General , bowing very politely , "
180293	180308	180290	180291	Dr. Swift	664	" Mr. Esmond went up to the Doctor with a bow and a smile : "
180316	180320	180309	180309	I	0	" says he , "
180337	180837	180327	180327	he	664	" Indeed poor Leach had come to his house very soon after the Doctor left it , being brought away rather tipsy from the tavern by his thrifty wife ; and he talked of Cousin Swift in a maudlin way , though of course Mr. Esmond did not allude to this relationship . The Doctor scowled , blushed , and was much confused , and said scarce a word during the whole of dinner . A very little stone will sometimes knock down these Goliaths of wit ; and this one was often discomfited when met by a man of any spirit ; he took his place sulkily , put water in his wine that the others drank plentifully , and scarce said a word . The talk was about the affairs of the day , or rather about persons than affairs : my Lady Marlborough 's fury , her daughters in old clothes and mob - caps looking out from their windows and seeing the company pass to the Drawing - room ; the gentleman - usher 's horror when the Prince of Savoy was introduced to her Majesty in a tie - wig , no man out of a full - bottomed periwig ever having kissed the Royal hand before ; about the Mohawks and the damage they were doing , rushing through the town , killing and murdering . Some one said the ill - omened face of Mohun had been seen at the theatre the night before , and Macartney and Meredith with him . Meant to be a feast , the meeting , in spite of drink and talk , was as dismal as a funeral . Every topic started subsided into gloom . His Grace of Ormonde went away because the conversation got upon Denain , where we had been defeated in the last campaign . Esmond 's General was affected at the allusion to this action too , for his comrade of Wynendael , the Count of Nassau Woudenbourg , had been slain there . Mr. Swift , when Esmond pledged him , said he drank no wine , and took his hat from the peg and went away , beckoning my Lord Bolingbroke to follow him ; but the other bade him take his chariot and save his coach - hire he had to speak with Colonel Esmond ; and when the rest of the company withdrew to cards , these two remained behind in the dark . Bolingbroke always spoke freely when he had drunk freely . His enemies could get any secret out of him in that condition ; women were even employed to ply him , and take his words down . I have heard that my Lord Stair , three years after , when the Secretary fled to France and became the Pretender 's Minister , got all the information he wanted by putting female spies over St. John in his cups . He spoke freely now : "
180897	180903	180894	180894	his	9211	" the Secretary went on . "
180999	181005	181030	181030	he	607	" We drank it together . "
181013	181018	181030	181030	he	607	" asked Mr. Esmond . "
181024	181029	181030	181030	he	607	" says the other , "
181117	181131	181109	181109	damme	600	" He was quite flushed and wild with wine as he was talking . "
181135	181146	181109	181109	damme	600	" says Esmond , who always had this gloomy apprehension , "
181167	181168	181155	181156	the French	2659	" "
181176	181181	181155	181156	the French	2659	" starts up Bolingbroke ; "
181259	181260	181254	181255	the French	888	" "
181265	181270	181254	181255	the French	888	" says Mr. Esmond . "
181278	181289	181275	181276	his grandfather	5162	" broke out St. John , filling out another bumper . "
181466	181556	181460	181460	God	1113	" He filled another great bumper , and tossed it up and drained it wildly , just as the noise of rapid carriage - wheels approaching was stopped at our door , and after a hurried knock and a moment 's interval , Mr. Swift came into the hall , ran up stairs to the room we were dining in , and entered it with a perturbed face . St. John , excited with drink , was making some wild quotation out of Macbeth , but Swift stopped him . "
181569	181573	181574	181574	I	0	" says he . "
181582	181583	181574	181574	I	0	" "

181739	181743	181735	181735	Beatrix	1064	" thought Esmond , "
181753	181753	181735	181735	Beatrix	1064	"
182465	182468	182470	182470	she	9283	" Come , "
182472	182484	182470	182470	she	9283	" cousin , and admire the taste of this pretty thing . "
182605	182613	182615	182615	Beatrix	1142	" Is n't this a beautiful piece ? "
182681	182690	182692	182692	he	427	" ' Tis a pretty piece of vanity , "
182727	182730	182732	182732	she	1142	" Vanity ! "
182736	182774	182732	182732	she	1142	" What is vanity in you , sir , is propriety in me . You ask a Jewish price for it , Mr. Graves ; but have it I will , if only to spite Mr. Esmond . "
182775	182784	182786	182787	Mr. Esmond	427	" Oh , Beatrix , lay it down ! "
182789	182802	182803	182803	She	1142	" Herodias ! you know not what you carry in the charger . "

182931	182940	182942	182942	Esmond	427	" Oh , my Beatrix , my sister ! "
182955	182983	182984	182984	She	1142	" you have the greatest courage of any woman in the world ; prepare to show it now , for you have a dreadful trial to bear . "
182996	183002	183004	183004	she	1142	" Hath he left me ? "
183006	183032	183004	183004	she	1142	" We had words this morning : he was very gloomy , and I angered him : but he dared not , he dared not ! "
183068	183074	183076	183076	Esmond	427	" He has left you , "
183089	183095	183097	183097	Beatrix	1142	" And he is alive , "
183099	183151	183097	183097	Beatrix	1142	" and you bring me this commission ! He has left me , and you have n't dared to avenge me ! You , that pretend to be the champion of our house , have let me suffer this insult ! Where is Castlewood ? I will go to my brother . "
183152	183161	183163	183163	Esmond	1031	" The Duke is not alive , Beatrix , "
183185	183197	183165	183165	She	1142	" And you come here , and and you killed him ? "
183198	183204	183205	183206	her kinsman	11305	" No ; thank heaven ! "
183209	183367	183205	183206	her kinsman	11305	" The blood of that noble heart doth not stain my sword ! In its last hour it was faithful to thee , Beatrix Esmond . Vain and cruel woman ! kneel and thank the awful heaven which awards life and death , and chastises pride , that the noble Hamilton died true to you ; at least that ' twas not your quarrel , or your pride , or your wicked vanity , that drove him to his fate . He died by the bloody sword which already had drank your own father 's blood . O woman , O sister ! to that sad field where two corpses are lying for the murderer died too by the hand of the man he slew can you bring no mourners but your revenge and your vanity ? God help and pardon thee , Beatrix , as he brings this awful punishment to your hard and rebellious heart . "

188383	188413	188381	188381	he	427	" are they to me ? The diamond loop to his hat did not set off Prince Eugene , and will not make my yellow face look any handsomer . "

189573	189689	189571	189571	brother	13268	" She gave him her cheek as a brotherly privilege . The cheek was as cold as marble . Esmond 's mistress showed no signs of jealousy when he returned to the room where she was . She had schooled herself so as to look quite inscrutably , when she had a mind . Amongst her other feminine qualities she had that of being a perfect dissembler . He rode away from Castlewood to attempt the task he was bound on , and stand or fall by it ; in truth his state of mind was such , that he was eager for some outward excitement to counteract that gnawing malady which he was inwardly enduring .
191223	191240	191219	191220	Mr. Esmond	427	" No doubt he should come by his name if ever greater people came by theirs . "

Madame Maintenon continues well . They have performed a play of Mons . Racine at St. Cyr . The Duke of Shrewsbury and Mr. Prior , our envoy , and all the English nobility here were present at it . The Viscount Castlewood 's passports were refused to him , ' twas said ; his lordship being sued by a goldsmith for Vaisselle plate , and a pearl necklace supplied to Mademoiselle Meruel of the French Comedy . ' Tis a pity such news should get abroad and travel to England about our young nobility here . Mademoiselle Meruel has been sent to the Fort l'Evesque ; they say she has ordered not only plate , but furniture , and a chariot and horses under that lord 's name , of which extravagance his unfortunate Viscountess knows nothing .

193452	193850	193401	193403	The Lord Castlewood	440	" All this letter , save some dozen of words which I have put above between brackets , was mere idle talk , though the substance of the letter was as important as any letter well could be . It told those that had the key , that The King will take the Viscount Castlewood 's passports and travel to England under that lord 's name . His Majesty will be at the Lady Castlewood 's house in Kensington Square , where his friends may visit him ; they are to ask for the Lord Castlewood . This note may have passed under Mr. Prior 's eyes , and those of our new allies the French , and taught them nothing ; though it explains sufficiently to persons in London what the event was which was about to happen , as ' twill show those who read my memoirs a hundred years hence , what was that errand on which Colonel Esmond of late had been busy . Silently and swiftly to do that about which others were conspiring , and thousands of Jacobites all over the country clumsily caballing ; alone to effect that which the leaders here were only talking about ; to bring the Prince of Wales into the country openly in the face of all , under Bolingbroke 's very eyes , the walls placarded with the proclamation signed with the Secretary 's name , and offering five hundred pounds reward for his apprehension : this was a stroke , the playing and winning of which might well give any adventurous spirit pleasure : the loss of the stake might involve a heavy penalty , but all our family were eager to risk that for the glorious chance of winning the game . Nor shall it be called a game , save perhaps with the chief player , who was not more or less sceptical than most public men with whom he had acquaintance in that age . Is there ever a public man in England that altogether believes in his party ? Is there one , however doubtful , that will not fight for it ? Young Frank was ready to fight without much thinking , he was a Jacobite as his father before him was ; all the Esmonds were Royalists . Give him but the word , he would cry , "
193856	194244	193401	193403	The Lord Castlewood	440	" before the palace guard , or at the Maypole in the Strand ; and with respect to the women , as is usual with them , ' twas not a question of party but of faith ; their belief was a passion ; either Esmond 's mistress or her daughter would have died for it cheerfully . I have laughed often , talking of King William 's reign , and said I thought Lady Castlewood was disappointed the King did not persecute the family more ; and those who know the nature of women may fancy for themselves , what needs not here be written down , the rapture with which these neophytes received the mystery when made known to them ; the eagerness with which they looked forward to its completion ; the reverence which they paid the minister who initiated them into that secret Truth , now known only to a few , but presently to reign over the world . Sure there is no bound to the trustingness of women . Look at Arria worshipping the drunken clodpate of a husband who beats her ; look at Cornelia treasuring as a jewel in her maternal heart the oaf her son ; I have known a woman preach Jesuit 's bark , and afterwards Dr. Berkeley 's tar - water , as though to swallow them were a divine decree , and to refuse them no better than blasphemy . On his return from France Colonel Esmond put himself at the head of this little knot of fond conspirators . No death or torture he knew would frighten them out of their constancy . When he detailed his plan for bringing the King back , his elder mistress thought that that Restoration was to be attributed under heaven to the Castlewood family and to its chief , and she worshipped and loved Esmond , if that could be , more than ever she had done . She doubted not for one moment of the success of his scheme , to mistrust which would have seemed impious in her eyes . And as for Beatrix , when she became acquainted with the plan , and joined it , as she did with all her heart , she gave Esmond one of her searching bright looks . "
194249	194253	194247	194247	Harry	427	" says she , "
194334	194382	194330	194330	I	0	" And she went away , shaking her head mournfully , but always , it seemed to Esmond , that her liking and respect for him was greatly increased , since she knew what capability he had both to act and bear ; to do and to forego .

195874	195939	195855	195855	Frank	597	" I do n't think he should have laughed as he told me the story .

He does not seem to think what a stake we are all playing . He would have stopped at Canterbury to run after a barmaid there , had I not implored him to come on . He hath a house at Chaillot , where he used to go and bury himself for weeks away from the Queen , and with all sorts of bad company , "

197537	197556	197535	197535	he	2357	" my mother will thank your ladyship for your hospitality to her son ; for you , madam , "
197561	197598	197535	197535	he	2357	" I can not bear to see so much beauty in such a posture . You will betray Monsieur Baptiste if you kneel to him ; sure ' tis his place rather to kneel to you . "
197792	197799	197801	197801	he	979	" I have kept my word , "

197874	198015	197827	197828	the Colonel	2816	" And when she looked up again , as she did in a moment , and after a sigh , her eyes , as they gazed at her cousin , wore that melancholy and inscrutable look which ' twas always impossible to sound . When the time came for the supper , of which we were advertised by a knocking overhead , Colonel Esmond and the two ladies went to the upper apartment , where the Prince already was , and by his side the young Viscount , of exactly the same age , shape , and with features not dissimilar , though Frank 's were the handsomer of the two . The Prince sat down and bade the ladies sit . The gentlemen remained standing : there was , indeed , but one more cover laid at the table : "
198023	198027	198018	198018	you	10176	" says he . "
198034	198061	198018	198018	you	10176	" says Lady Castlewood , taking her son 's hand , and looking towards Colonel Esmond with a bow and a great tremor of the voice ; "
198075	198076	198077	198077	I	0	" "
198089	198120	198121	198121	I	0	" says Colonel Esmond , filling a cup of wine , and , as the fashion of that day was , he presented it to the King on his knee . "
198130	198228	198121	198121	I	0	" says the Prince , with no very well - pleased air ; but the cloud passed immediately off his face , and he talked to the ladies in a lively , rattling strain , quite undisturbed by poor Mr. Esmond 's yellow countenance , that , I dare say , looked very glum . When the time came to take leave , Esmond marched homewards to his lodgings , and met Mr. Addison on the road that night , walking to a cottage he had at Fulham , the moon shining on his handsome serene face : "
198234	198240	198232	198232	brother	13268	" says Addison , laughing : "
198404	198451	198391	198393	the Sigeia tellus	10195	" he repeated , with ever so slight a touch of merum in his voice , and walked back a little way on the road with Esmond , bidding the other remember he was always his friend , and indebted to him for his aid in the "
198453	198507	198508	198508	I	0	" poem . And very likely Mr. Under - Secretary would have stepped in and taken t'other bottle at the Colonel 's lodging , had the latter invited him , but Esmond 's mood was none of the gayest , and he bade his friend an inhospitable good - night at the door . "
198514	198527	198508	198508	I	0	" thought he , sleepless , and looking out into the night ; "
198614	199223	199224	199224	I	0	" The eager gaze of the young Prince , watching every movement of Beatrix , haunted Esmond and pursued him . The Prince 's figure appeared before him in his feverish dreams many times that night . He wished the deed undone for which he had labored so . He was not the first that has regretted his own act , or brought about his own undoing . Undoing ? Should he write that word in his late years ? No , on his knees before heaven , rather be thankful for what then he deemed his misfortune , and which hath caused the whole subsequent happiness of his life . Esmond 's man , honest John Lockwood , had served his master and the family all his life , and the Colonel knew that he could answer for John 's fidelity as for his own . John returned with the horses from Rochester betimes the next morning , and the Colonel gave him to understand that on going to Kensington , where he was free of the servants ' hall , and indeed courting Miss Beatrix 's maid , he was to ask no questions , and betray no surprise , but to vouch stoutly that the young gentleman he should see in a red coat there was my Lord Viscount Castlewood , and that his attendant in gray was Monsieur Baptiste the Frenchman . He was to tell his friends in the kitchen such stories as he remembered of my Lord Viscount 's youth at Castlewood ; what a wild boy he was ; how he used to drill Jack and cane him , before ever he was a soldier ; everything , in fine , he knew respecting my Lord Viscount 's early days . Jack 's ideas of painting had not been much cultivated during his residence in Flanders with his master ; and , before my young lord 's return , he had been easily got to believe that the picture brought over from Paris , and now hanging in Lady Castlewood 's drawing - room , was a perfect likeness of her son , the young lord . And the domestics having all seen the picture many times , and catching but a momentary imperfect glimpse of the two strangers on the night of their arrival , never had a reason to doubt the fidelity of the portrait ; and next day , when they saw the original of the piece habited exactly as he was represented in the painting , with the same periwig , ribbons , and uniform of the Guard , quite naturally addressed the gentleman as my Lord Castlewood , my Lady Viscountess 's son . The secretary of the night previous was now the viscount ; the viscount wore the secretary 's gray frock ; and John Lockwood was instructed to hint to the world below stairs that my lord being a Papist , and very devout in that religion , his attendant might be no other than his chaplain from Bruxelles ; hence , if he took his meals in my lord 's company there was little reason for surprise . Frank was further cautioned to speak English with a foreign accent , which task he performed indifferently well , and this caution was the more necessary because the Prince himself scarce spoke our language like a native of the island : and John Lockwood laughed with the folks below stairs at the manner in which my lord , after five years abroad , sometimes forgot his own tongue , and spoke it like a Frenchman . "
199227	199231	199224	199224	I	0	" says he , "
199254	199333	199335	199335	her	10202	" and , to do his new lordship justice , he took to beer and beef very kindly . The Prince drank so much , and was so loud and imprudent in his talk after his drink , that Esmond often trembled for him . His meals were served as much as possible in his own chamber , though frequently he made his appearance in Lady Castlewood 's parlor and drawing - room , calling Beatrix ' sister , "
199337	199340	199335	199335	her	10202	" mother , "
199342	199344	199335	199335	her	10202	" madam "
199423	199448	199408	199410	poor Jack Lockwood	805	" My Lord that is the gentleman has been tampering with Mrs. Lucy Jack 's sweetheart , and given her guineas and a kiss . "
199797	199846	199785	199785	he	427	" What ! the soubrette has peached to the amoureux , and Crispin is angry , and Crispin has served , and Crispin has been a corporal , has he ? Tell him we will reward his valor with a pair of colors , and recompense his fidelity . "
199868	199891	199893	199893	he	427	" Assez , milord : je m'ennuye a la preche ; I am not come to London to go to the sermon . "

199927	199938	199893	199893	he	427	" fatigued him with his grand airs and virtuous homilies . "

200667	200673	200675	200676	the Prince	2357	" Rather than lose those , "
200678	200689	200675	200676	the Prince	2357	" he shall be made Archbishop and Colonel of the Guard "
200727	200730	200732	200732	she	10285	" Yes , "
200755	200769	200749	200749	I	0	" Yes , he shall be Archbishop of Esmond and Marquis of Canterbury . "
200770	200778	200780	200781	the Prince	2357	" And what will your ladyship be ? "
200783	200792	200780	200781	the Prince	2357	" you have but to choose your place . "
200793	200796	200798	200798	Beatrix	837	" I , "
200800	200821	200823	200823	she	10285	" will be mother of the maids to the Queen of his Majesty King James the Third Vive le Roy ! "
200843	200859	200860	200860	Castlewood	597	" The Prince seized hold of the glass and drank the last drop of it , "
200863	200891	200860	200860	Castlewood	597	" and my mother , looking very anxious , rose up and asked leave to retire . But that Trix is my mother 's daughter , Harry , "
200895	200958	200892	200892	Frank	597	" I do n't know what a horrid fear I should have of her . I wish I wish this business were over . You are older than I am , and wiser , and better , and I owe you everything , and would die for you before George I would ; but I wish the end of this were come . "
201254	201259	201260	201261	Mr. Gay	663	" Rogues ' Opera , "
202172	202194	202161	202162	the Queen	5108	" This , my lords , is my brother ; here is my father 's heir , and mine after me . "
202794	202805	202783	202783	Frank	597	" I think Beatrix had best be anywhere but here , "
202810	202824	202806	202807	Lady Castlewood	494	" I thank you , Frank , I have thought so , too ; "
202861	202872	202874	202875	the viscountess	11537	" One sees that you think with us , Henry , "
202887	202920	202884	202884	her	11537	" Beatrix is best out of this house whilst we have our guest in it , and as soon as this morning 's business is done , she ought to quit London . "
202921	202927	202929	202930	Colonel Esmond	979	" What morning 's business ? "
203522	203528	203530	203530	he	2357	" In half an hour , "
203532	203691	203530	203530	he	2357	" her Majesty and her favorite lady will take the air in the Cedar - walk behind the new Banqueting - house . Her Majesty will be drawn in a garden - chair , Madam Beatrix Esmond and HER BROTHER , MY LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEWOOD , will be walking in the private garden , here is Lady Masham 's key , and will come unawares upon the Royal party . The man that draws the chair will retire , and leave the Queen , the favorite , and the maid of honor and her brother together ; Mistress Beatrix will present her brother , and then ! and then , my Lord Bishop will pray for the result of the interview , and his Scots clerk will say Amen ! Quick , put on your hood , Madam Beatrix ; why doth not his Majesty come down ? Such another chance may not present itself for months again . "
203914	203923	203925	203925	she	837	" We may all hope for the best , "
203927	204050	203925	203925	she	837	" it has cost the Queen a fit . Her Majesty was in her chair in the Cedar - walk , accompanied only by Lady , when we entered by the private wicket from the west side of the garden , and turned towards her , the Doctor following us . They waited in a side walk hidden by the shrubs , as we advanced towards the chair . My heart throbbed so I scarce could speak ; but my Prince whispered , ' Courage , Beatrix , ' and marched on with a steady step . His face was a little flushed , but he was not afraid of the danger . He who fought so bravely at Malplaquet fears nothing . "
204069	204074	204075	204075	Beatrix	837	" The Prince uncovered , "
204078	204185	204075	204075	Beatrix	837	" and I saw the Queen turning round to Lady Masham , as if asking who these two were . Her Majesty looked very pale and ill , and then flushed up ; the favorite made us a signal to advance , and I went up , leading my Prince by the hand , quite close to the chair : ' Your Majesty will give my Lord Viscount your hand to kiss , ' says her lady , and the Queen put out her hand , which the Prince kissed , kneeling on his knee , he who should kneel to no mortal man or woman . "
204219	204247	204199	204200	the Queen	5108	" ' I am come , Madam , to stay now , if the Queen desires me , ' says the Prince , with another low bow . "
204275	204312	204320	204321	the favorite	6648	" ' In returning to my father 's church , ' says the Prince , ' I do not love my mother the less , nor am I the less faithful servant of your majesty . ' "
204315	204319	204320	204321	the favorite	6648	" says Beatrix , "
204807	204822	204823	204823	God	1113	" says Beatrix , going down on her knees , and clasping her hands . "
204833	204968	204969	204969	We	10534	" Beatrix 's tale told , and the young lady herself calmed somewhat of her agitation , we asked with regard to the Prince , who was absent with Bishop Atterbury , and were informed that ' twas likely he might remain abroad the whole day . Beatrix 's three kinsfolk looked at one another at this intelligence : ' twas clear the same thought was passing through the minds of all . But who should begin to break the news ? Monsieur Baptiste , that is Frank Castlewood , turned very red , and looked towards Esmond ; the Colonel bit his lips , and fairly beat a retreat into the window : it was Lady Castlewood that opened upon Beatrix with the news which we knew would do anything but please her . "
204973	204990	204969	204969	We	10534	" says she , taking her daughter 's hand , and speaking in a gentle voice , "
204997	205019	204969	204969	We	10534	" Beatrix drew back in an instant , looking round her at us three , and as if divining a danger . "
205023	205033	204969	204969	We	10534	" says she , her breast beginning to heave ; "
205042	205043	205035	205035	you	10536	" "
205056	205062	205044	205044	We	10534	" cries out Frank Castlewood . "
205094	205106	205075	205075	mamma	11270	" here she turned with an imperious look towards Colonel Esmond , "
205118	205119	205120	205120	We	10534	" "
205132	205133	205120	205120	We	10534	" "
205140	205165	205138	205138	madam	11439	" says Beatrix , with a toss of the head and a curtsey . But her mother continued , with very great calmness and dignity "
205198	205199	205189	205189	her	3612	" "
205205	205210	205202	205203	mon pere	10548	" breaks out Beatrix , "
205220	205256	205257	205257	You	10545	" And again she looked towards the Colonel . We all felt a shock as she uttered those two or three French words ; her manner was exactly imitated from that of our foreign guest . "
205270	205277	205257	205257	You	10545	" says her mother , sadly , "
205286	205307	205308	205308	I	0	" Beatrix , no doubt , saw that slip she had made in her flurry , for she blushed crimson : "
205316	205323	205313	205314	the King	1293	" says she , drawing up , "
205338	205339	205330	205330	others	1642	" "
205349	205353	205354	205354	Trix	461	" Frank said , "

205370	205379	205365	205365	I	0	" says she , turning round on him ; "
205415	205420	205421	205421	he	12480	" she went on ; "
205449	205473	205474	205474	You	0	" The Prince had used almost the very same words in regard to Colonel Esmond that the imprudent girl repeated in her wrath . "
205484	205496	205474	205474	You	0	" says the Colonel ; and , turning to his mistress , "
205529	205530	205517	205517	he	10565	" "
205537	205548	205532	205532	you	0	" cries my lord , starting up with an oath : "
205558	205559	205550	205550	God	1113	" "
205580	205586	205588	205588	your	0	" cries Frank 's sister . "
205649	205650	205672	205672	you	0	" "
205654	205664	205672	205672	you	0	" says my lord , rapping out another oath , "
205679	205703	205672	205672	you	0	" Colonel Esmond could not refrain from a smile , to see how easy Frank 's attack was drawn off by that feint : "
205714	205722	205723	205723	her	11270	" says Mr. Esmond , rather scornfully ; "
205757	205758	205759	205759	He	0	" "
205766	205770	205772	205772	he	0	" says Beatrix , "
205811	205830	205833	205833	I	0	" Here was another desperate sally of the poor beleaguered garrison , and an alerte in another quarter . "
205838	205842	205833	205833	I	0	" says Esmond . "
206015	206256	206257	206257	I	0	" As the Colonel spoke with a perfect calmness and politeness , such as ' tis to be hoped he hath always shown to women , his mistress stood by him on one side of the table , and Frank Castlewood on the other , hemming in poor Beatrix , that was behind it , and , as it were , surrounding her with our approaches . My dear father saith quite truly , that his manner towards our sex was uniformly courteous . From my infancy upwards , he treated me with an extreme gentleness , as though I was a little lady . I can scarce remember though I tried him often ever hearing a rough word from him , nor was he less grave and kind in his manner to the humblest negresses on his estate . He was familiar with no one except my mother , and it was delightful to witness up to the very last days the confidence between them . He was obeyed eagerly by all under him ; and my mother and all her household lived in a constant emulation to please him , and quite a terror lest in any way they should offend him . He was the humblest man with all this ; the least exacting , the more easily contented ; and Mr. Benson , our minister at Castlewood , who attended him at the last , ever said "
206279	206336	206337	206337	I	0	" R. E. W. Having twice sallied out and been beaten back , she now , as I expected , tried the ultima ratio of women , and had recourse to tears . Her beautiful eyes filled with them ; I never could bear in her , nor in any woman , that expression of pain : "
206341	206345	206346	206346	you	10599	" sobbed she ; "
206496	206497	206491	206491	you	10599	" "
206506	206512	206491	206491	you	10599	" says Esmond , gravely , "
206602	206603	206604	206604	Harry	427	" "
206610	206620	206604	206604	Harry	427	" says Frank , with one of his oaths , "
206699	206700	206689	206690	Harry Esmond	427	" "
206711	206733	206689	206690	Harry Esmond	427	" says Beatrix , something sorrowfully ; ' sure , with you two watching , no evil could happen to me . "
206734	206744	206746	206747	Colonel Esmond	454	" In faith , I think not , Beatrix , "
206749	206760	206746	206747	Colonel Esmond	454	" nor if the Prince knew us would he try . "
206761	206768	206770	206771	Lady Castlewood	494	" But does he know you ? "
206776	206864	206770	206771	Lady Castlewood	494	" he comes of a country where the pursuit of kings is thought no dishonor to a woman . Let us go , dearest Beatrix . Shall we go to Walcote or to Castlewood ? We are best away from the city ; and when the Prince is acknowledged , and our champions have restored him , and he hath his own house at St. James 's or Windsor , we can come back to ours here . Do you not think so , Harry and Frank ? "
206877	206884	206886	206886	Beatrix	837	" We will go , then , "
206893	206913	206886	206886	Beatrix	837	" Lady Masham is to give me warning to - night how her Majesty is , and to - morrow "
206914	206928	206930	206932	my Lady Castlewood	11403	" I think we had best go to - day , my dear , "
206934	206968	206930	206932	my Lady Castlewood	11403	" we might have the coach and sleep at Hounslow , and reach home to - morrow . ' Tis twelve o'clock ; bid the coach , cousin , be ready at one . "
206969	206973	206976	206976	Beatrix	837	" For shame ! "
206986	207233	207234	207234	She	10627	" You disgrace me by your cruel precautions ; my own mother is the first to suspect me , and would take me away as my gaoler . I will not go with you , mother ; I will go as no one 's prisoner . If I wanted to deceive , do you think I could find no means of evading you ? My family suspects me . As those mistrust me that ought to love me most , let me leave them ; I will go , but I will go alone : to Castlewood , be it . I have been unhappy there and lonely enough ; let me go back , but spare me at least the humiliation of setting a watch over my misery , which is a trial I ca n't bear . Let me go when you will , but alone , or not at all . You three can stay and triumph over my unhappiness , and I will bear it as I have borne it before . Let my gaoler - in - chief go order the coach that is to take me away . I thank you , Henry Esmond , for your share in the conspiracy . All my life long I 'll thank you , and remember you , and you , brother , and you , mother , how shall I show my gratitude to you for your careful defence of my honor ? "
207441	207447	207449	207449	she	10627	" I have brought back , "
207451	207543	207449	207449	she	10627	" to the Marquis of Esmond the present he deigned to make me in days when he trusted me better than now . I will never accept a benefit or a kindness from Henry Esmond more , and I give back these family diamonds , which belonged to one king 's mistress , to the gentleman that suspected I would be another . Have you been upon your message of coach - caller , my Lord Marquis ? Will you send your valet to see that I do not run away ? "
207698	207708	207710	207711	her mother	11361	" Do you leave this , too , Beatrix ? "
207842	207848	207850	207850	she	494	" I had forgot it , "
207852	207943	207850	207850	she	494	" my injury made me forget my grief : my mother has recalled both to me . Farewell , mother ; I think I never can forgive you ; something hath broke between us that no tears nor years can repair . I always said I was alone ; you never loved me , never and were jealous of me from the time I sat on my father 's knee . Let me go away , the sooner the better : I can bear to be with you no more . "
207944	207949	207951	207952	her mother	11361	" Go , child , "
207958	208015	207951	207952	her mother	11361	" go and bend your proud knees and ask forgiveness ; go , pray in solitude for humility and repentance . ' Tis not your reproaches that make me unhappy , ' tis your hard heart , my poor Beatrix ; may God soften it , and teach you one day to feel for your mother . "
208252	208260	208266	208266	she	837	" The Queen hath been much shaken , "
208290	208299	208279	208281	MY LORD CASTLEWOOD	1504	" At night there came a second billet : "
208384	208999	209000	209001	Even Quakers	10679	" The Prince came home shortly after the messenger who bore this billet had left the house . His Royal Highness was so much the better for the Bishop 's liquor , that to talk affairs to him now was of little service . He was helped to the Royal bed ; he called Castlewood familiarly by his own name ; he quite forgot the part upon the acting of which his crown , his safety , depended . ' Twas lucky that my Lady Castlewood 's servants were out of the way , and only those heard him who would not betray him . He inquired after the adorable Beatrix , with a royal hiccup in his voice ; he was easily got to bed , and in a minute or two plunged in that deep slumber and forgetfulness with which Bacchus rewards the votaries of that god . We wished Beatrix had been there to see him in his cups . We regretted , perhaps , that she was gone . One of the party at Kensington Square was fool enough to ride to Hounslow that night , coram latronibus , and to the inn which the family used ordinarily in their journeys out of London . Esmond desired my landlord not to acquaint Madam Beatrix with his coming , and had the grim satisfaction of passing by the door of the chamber where she lay with her maid , and of watching her chariot set forth in the early morning . He saw her smile and slip money into the man 's hand who was ordered to ride behind the coach as far as Bagshot . The road being open , and the other servant armed , it appeared she dispensed with the escort of a second domestic ; and this fellow , bidding his young mistress adieu with many bows , went and took a pot of ale in the kitchen , and returned in company with his brother servant , John Coachman , and his horses , back to London . They were not a mile out of Hounslow when the two worthies stopped for more drink , and here they were scared by seeing Colonel Esmond gallop by them . The man said in reply to Colonel Esmond 's stern question , that his young mistress had sent her duty ; only that , no other message : she had had a very good night , and would reach Castlewood by nightfall . The Colonel had no time for further colloquy , and galloped on swiftly to London , having business of great importance there , as my reader very well knoweth . The thought of Beatrix riding away from the danger soothed his mind not a little . His horse was at Kensington Square honest Dapple knew the way thither well enough before the tipsy guest of last night was awake and sober . The account of the previous evening was known all over the town early next day . A violent altercation had taken place before the Queen in the Council Chamber ; and all the coffee - houses had their version of the quarrel . The news brought my Lord Bishop early to Kensington Square , where he awaited the waking of his Royal master above stairs , and spoke confidently of having him proclaimed as Prince of Wales and heir to the throne before that day was over . The Bishop had entertained on the previous afternoon certain of the most influential gentlemen of the true British party . His Royal highness had charmed all , both Scots and English , Papists and Churchmen : "
209003	209007	209000	209001	Even Quakers	10679	" says he , "
209043	209051	209039	209040	my Lord	1352	" says the Bishop with a laugh , "
209084	209089	209069	209069	He	14255	" says the Bishop , "
209119	209243	209105	209105	she	10684	" Her ladyship said , dryly , that Beatrix was not at home that morning ; my Lord Bishop was too busy with great affairs to trouble himself much about the presence or absence of any lady , however beautiful . We were yet at table when Dr. A came from the Palace with a look of great alarm ; the shocks the Queen had had the day before had acted on her severely ; he had been sent for , and had ordered her to be blooded . The surgeon of Long Acre had come to cup the Queen , and her Majesty was now more easy and breathed more freely . What made us start at the name of Mr. Ayme ? "
209252	209794	209105	209105	she	10684	" says the merry Doctor ; Esmond pulled his sleeve , and bade him hush . It was to Ayme 's house , after his fatal duel , that my dear Lord Castlewood , Frank 's father , had been carried to die . No second visit could be paid to the Queen on that day at any rate ; and when our guest above gave his signal that he was awake , the Doctor , the Bishop , and Colonel Esmond waited upon the Prince 's levee , and brought him their news , cheerful or dubious . The Doctor had to go away presently , but promised to keep the Prince constantly acquainted with what was taking place at the Palace hard by . His counsel was , and the Bishop 's , that as soon as ever the Queen 's malady took a favorable turn , the Prince should be introduced to her bedside ; the Council summoned ; the guard at Kensington and St. James 's , of which two regiments were to be entirely relied on , and one known not to be hostile , would declare for the Prince , as the Queen would before the Lords of her Council , designating him as the heir to her throne . With locked doors , and Colonel Esmond acting as secretary , the Prince and his Lordship of Rochester passed many hours of this day , composing Proclamations and Addresses to the Country , to the Scots , to the Clergy , to the People of London and England ; announcing the arrival of the exile descendant of three sovereigns , and his acknowledgment by his sister as heir to the throne . Every safeguard for their liberties , the Church and People could ask , was promised to them . The Bishop could answer for the adhesion of very many prelates , who besought of their flocks and brother ecclesiastics to recognize the sacred right of the future sovereign , and to purge the country of the sin of rebellion . During the composition of these papers , more messengers than one came from the Palace regarding the state of the august patient there lying . At mid - day she was somewhat better ; at evening the torpor again seized her , and she wandered in her mind . At night Dr. A was with us again , with a report rather more favorable : no instant danger at any rate was apprehended . In the course of the last two years her Majesty had had many attacks similar , but more severe . By this time we had finished a half - dozen of Proclamations , the wording of them so as to offend no parties , and not to give umbrage to Whigs or Dissenters , required very great caution , and the young Prince , who had indeed shown , during a long day 's labor , both alacrity at seizing the information given him , and ingenuity and skill in turning the phrases which were to go out signed by his name , here exhibited a good - humor and thoughtfulness that ought to be set down to his credit . "
209802	209806	209839	209839	your	10688	" says he , "
209874	209895	209863	209863	they	10689	" and so , having carefully copied the Proclamations out , the Prince burned those in Colonel Esmond 's handwriting : "
209904	209908	209863	209863	they	10689	" says he , "
209948	210680	209936	209936	you	454	" The Prince 's meals were commonly served in the chamber which had been Beatrix 's bedroom , adjoining that in which he slept . And the dutiful practice of his entertainers was to wait until their Royal guest bade them take their places at table before they sat down to partake of the meal . On this night , as you may suppose , only Frank Castlewood and his mother were in waiting when the supper was announced to receive the Prince ; who had passed the whole of the day in his own apartment , with the Bishop as his Minister of State , and Colonel Esmond officiating as Secretary of his Council . The Prince 's countenance wore an expression by no means pleasant ; when looking towards the little company assembled , and waiting for him , he did not see Beatrix 's bright face there as usual to greet him . He asked Lady Esmond for his fair introducer of yesterday : her ladyship only cast her eyes down , and said quietly , Beatrix could not be of the supper that night ; nor did she show the least sign of confusion , whereas Castlewood turned red , and Esmond was no less embarrassed . I think women have an instinct of dissimulation ; they know by nature how to disguise their emotions far better than the most consummate male courtiers can do . Is not the better part of the life of many of them spent in hiding their feelings , in cajoling their tyrants , in masking over with fond smiles and artful gayety , their doubt , or their grief , or their terror ? Our guest swallowed his supper very sulkily ; it was not till the second bottle his Highness began to rally . When Lady Castlewood asked leave to depart , he sent a message to Beatrix , hoping she would be present at the next day 's dinner , and applied himself to drink , and to talk afterwards , for which there was subject in plenty . The next day , we heard from our informer at Kensington that the Queen was somewhat better , and had been up for an hour , though she was not well enough yet to receive any visitor . At dinner a single cover was laid for his Royal Highness ; and the two gentlemen alone waited on him . We had had a consultation in the morning with Lady Castlewood , in which it had been determined that , should his Highness ask further questions about Beatrix , he should be answered by the gentlemen of the house . He was evidently disturbed and uneasy , looking towards the door constantly , as if expecting some one . There came , however , nobody , except honest John Lockwood , when he knocked with a dish , which those within took from him ; so the meals were always arranged , and I believe the council in the kitchen were of opinion that my young lord had brought over a priest , who had converted us all into Papists , and that Papists were like Jews , eating together , and not choosing to take their meals in the sight of Christians . The Prince tried to cover his displeasure ; he was but a clumsy dissembler at that time , and when out of humor could with difficulty keep a serene countenance ; and having made some foolish attempts at trivial talk , he came to his point presently , and in as easy a manner as he could , saying to Lord Castlewood , he hoped , he requested , his lordship 's mother and sister would be of the supper that night . As the time hung heavy on him , and he must not go abroad , would not Miss Beatrix hold him company at a game of cards ? At this , looking up at Esmond , and taking the signal from him , Lord Castlewood informed his Royal Highness that his sister Beatrix was not at Kensington ; and that her family had thought it best she should quit the town . In London we addressed the Prince as Royal Highness invariably , though the women persisted in giving him the title of King . "
210685	210689	210691	210691	she	10694	" says he ; "
210728	210729	210722	210726	the master of this house	10698	" "
210736	210742	210752	210752	he	1424	" says Frank very nobly , "
210793	210794	210795	210798	The Marquis of Esmond	1031	" "
210805	210815	210800	210803	the Marquis of Esmond	6376	" says the Prince , tossing off a glass , "
210867	210868	210869	210869	I	0	" "
210891	210892	210877	210877	I	0	" "
210961	210977	210978	210978	I	0	" he spoke rapidly in French , his rage carrying him away with each phrase : "
211228	211359	211360	211360	Sir	1424	" This harangue was uttered with rapid gesticulation such as the French use , and in the language of that nation . The Prince striding up and down the room ; his face flushed , and his hands trembling with anger . He was very thin and frail from repeated illness and a life of pleasure . Either Castlewood or Esmond could have broke him across their knee , and in half a minute 's struggle put an end to him ; and here he was insulting us both , and scarce deigning to hide from the two , whose honor it most concerned , the passion he felt for the young lady of our family . My Lord Castlewood replied to the Prince 's tirade very nobly and simply . "
211362	211366	211360	211360	Sir	1424	" says he , "
211428	211429	211425	211425	our	10745	" "
211444	211453	211454	211454	We	10745	" says the Prince with a peevish air . "
211466	211566	211454	211454	We	10745	" says Lord Castlewood with a low bow . The night being warm , the windows were open both towards the Gardens and the Square . Colonel Esmond heard through the closed door the voice of the watchman calling the hour , in the square on the other side . He opened the door communicating with the Prince 's room ; Martin , the servant that had rode with Beatrix to Hounslow , was just going out of the chamber as Esmond entered it , and when the fellow was gone , and the watchman again sang his cry of "
211576	211589	211594	211595	that man	11737	" Esmond spoke to the Prince in a low voice , and said "
211597	211598	211594	211595	that man	11737	" "
211603	211608	211609	211609	I	0	" says the Prince . "
211746	211747	211701	211701	his	2357	" "
211755	211771	211749	211750	your lordship	11873	" says the Prince , turning to Frank Castlewood , and quite pale with anger ; "
211791	211792	211793	211793	I	0	" "
211801	211808	211793	211793	I	0	" says Castlewood , bowing gravely . "
211827	211828	211829	211829	You	2357	" "
211954	212153	212154	212154	I	0	" And the Prince dismissed us with a grim bow , locking one door as he spoke , that into the supping - room , and the other through which we passed , after us . It led into the small chamber which Frank Castlewood or MONSIEUR BAPTISTE occupied , and by which Martin entered when Colonel Esmond but now saw him in the chamber . At an early hour next morning the Bishop arrived , and was closeted for some time with his master in his own apartment , where the Prince laid open to his counsellor the wrongs which , according to his version , he had received from the gentlemen of the Esmond family . The worthy prelate came out from the conference with an air of great satisfaction ; he was a man full of resources , and of a most assured fidelity , and possessed of genius , and a hundred good qualities ; but captious and of a most jealous temper , that could not help exulting at the downfall of any favorite ; and he was pleased in spite of himself to hear that the Esmond Ministry was at an end . "
212160	212226	212154	212154	I	0	" says he , coming out to the two gentlemen and the widow ; who had been made acquainted with somewhat of the dispute of the night before . By the version we gave her , the Prince was only made to exhibit anger because we doubted of his intentions in respect to Beatrix ; and to leave us , because we questioned his honor . "
212252	212257	212249	212250	Lady Castlewood	494	" says the Bishop , "
212267	212268	212260	212260	Beatrix	837	" "
212279	212285	212269	212269	She	837	" Esmond 's mistress said , "
212291	212292	212293	212293	You	10779	" "
212306	212320	212302	212302	I	0	" says the good Bishop , assuming the airs of a Prime Minister . "
212358	212365	212342	212342	he	2357	" says the Doctor , archly ; "
212401	212402	212403	212404	My lord	1352	" "
212409	212415	212403	212404	My lord	1352	" breaks out Lady Esmond , "
212441	212442	212436	212436	I	0	" "
212451	212463	212436	212436	I	0	" says the Bishop , with a shrug , taking snuff ; "
212483	212484	212433	212433	you	10779	" "
212492	212552	212433	212433	you	10779	" says Lady Castlewood , with a fine blush , and walked out of the room very stately . The Prince entered it presently with a smile on his face , and if he felt any offence against us on the previous night , at present exhibited none . He offered a hand to each gentleman with great courtesy . "
212564	212568	212561	212562	Doctor Atterbury	1213	" says he , "
212609	212613	212602	212602	I	0	" says he , "
212727	212788	212712	212712	I	0	" Lady Castlewood arrived presently , blushing with great grace , and tears filling her eyes as the Prince graciously saluted her . She looked so charming and young , that the doctor , in his bantering way , could not help speaking of her beauty to the Prince ; whose compliment made her blush , and look more charming still .

214994	215062	214987	214992	one of the generals there present	10997	" you were born under an unlucky star ; I begin to think that there 's no Mr. George , nor Mr. Dragon either . ' Tis not the peerage I care for , for our name is so ancient and famous , that merely to be called Lord Lydiard would do me no good ; but ' tis the chance you promised me of fighting Marlborough . "

Having had your noon 's draught , you had best pay the reckoning and go home ; there can be no game where there is no one to play it . "

He did not think of looking at it there , nor had Martin the chance of telling him .

216658	216666	216668	216669	the man	2202	" I shall open to no one , "
216696	216704	216706	216706	he	11069	" There are more ways than one , "
216708	216718	216719	216719	Frank	454	" of entering such a great house as this . "
216731	216746	216748	216749	Mr. Esmond	427	" But I know of a way that 's not a hundred yards off , "
216942	216947	216929	216929	He	427	" And what then ? "
216955	216961	216929	216929	He	427	" Did the man wait ? "
217148	217153	217158	217159	the man	2202	" Was this all ! "
217154	217157	217158	217159	the man	2202	" All , "
217173	217209	217158	217159	the man	2202	" Stop , there was one thing more . My lord , on arriving , and once or twice during supper , did kiss his sister , as was natural , and she kissed him . "
217248	217254	217256	217256	Esmond	837	" If it amuses thee , "
217260	217284	217256	217256	Esmond	837	" that your sister should be exchanging of kisses with a stranger , I fear poor Beatrix will give thee plenty of sport . "
217568	217574	217576	217576	Esmond	454	" You must back me , "
217578	217642	217576	217576	Esmond	454	" in what I am going to do . I have been thinking that yonder scoundrel may have been instructed to tell that story , and that the whole of it may be a lie ; if it be , we shall find it out from the gentleman who is asleep yonder . See if the door leading to my lady 's rooms , "
217669	217685	217666	217666	he	5338	" We tried ; it was indeed as the lackey had said , closed within . "
217695	217700	217666	217666	he	5338	" says poor Esmond ; "
217714	217715	217707	217708	our ancestor	6027	" "
217734	217758	217718	217718	you	11129	" The young man looked scared and frightened into his kinsman 's face ; I dare say it wore no very pleasant expression . "
217770	217839	217718	217718	you	11129	" says Esmond ; and went in at the passage and opened the door into what had been his own chamber now for wellnigh five - and - twenty years . A candle was still burning , and the Prince asleep dressed on the bed Esmond did not care for making a noise . The Prince started up in his bed , seeing two men in his chamber . "
217843	217856	217718	217718	you	11129	" says he , and took a pistol from under his pillow . "
217864	217869	217859	217862	the Marquis of Esmond	6376	" says the Colonel , "
217987	217988	217975	217978	the Prince of Wales	5107	" "
217994	218012	218013	218014	the Doctor	1628	" says the Prince , starting off his bed , whereon he was lying in his clothes , "
218041	218042	218013	218014	the Doctor	1628	" "
218049	218056	218013	218014	the Doctor	1628	" says Esmond with another bow ; "
218162	218163	218158	218159	your Majesty	11505	" "
218175	218205	218166	218166	Monsieur	4274	" said the Prince , who had now risen up and seemed to be looking to one of us to help him to his coat . But neither stirred . "
218211	218215	218168	218168	you	4274	" says Esmond , "
218225	218226	218229	218229	you	4274	" "
218234	218255	218229	218229	you	4274	" says the Prince , and muttered something about a guet - a - pens , which Esmond caught up . "
218261	218265	218269	218270	our laying	11169	" said he , "
218296	218297	218280	218280	We	11164	" "
218308	218316	218300	218300	Morbleu	1227	" says the Prince , turning scarlet , "
218323	218324	218300	218300	Morbleu	1227	" "
218332	218333	218334	218334	I	0	" "
218337	218344	218334	218334	I	0	" the Prince broke out impetuously , "
218354	218355	218352	218353	my lords	15218	" "
218370	218393	218368	218368	Frank	454	" says Colonel Esmond , turning round to young Castlewood , who stood at the door as the talk was going on . "
218467	218512	218458	218458	he	11175	" In fact , and actually as he was speaking , Esmond cast his eyes down towards the table , and saw a paper on which my young Prince had been scrawling a madrigal , that was to finish his charmer on the morrow . "
218515	218534	218458	218458	he	11175	" says the Prince , burning with rage he had assumed his Royal coat unassisted by this time , "
218543	218544	218536	218536	I	0	" "
218555	218566	218552	218553	your Majesty	11505	" says the Colonel , with a very low bow , "
218579	218580	218552	218553	your Majesty	11505	" "
218583	218600	218552	218553	your Majesty	11505	" says the young man , tears starting into his eyes with helpless rage and mortification . "
218609	218610	218603	218603	you	11179	" "
218622	218631	218632	218632	I	0	" says Esmond , preserving his grave tone , "
218655	218693	218649	218649	I	0	" and , taking the taper up , and backing before the Prince with very great ceremony , Mr. Esmond passed into the little Chaplain 's room , through which we had just entered into the house : "
218705	218765	218703	218703	Frank	454	" says the Colonel to his companion , who wondered almost as much at this scene , and was as much puzzled by it , as the other actor in it . Then going to the crypt over the mantel - piece , the Colonel opened it , and drew thence the papers which so long had lain there . "
218774	218778	218771	218772	your Majesty	11505	" says he , "
218884	218898	218899	218899	You	1424	" And as Esmond spoke he set the papers burning in the brazier . "
218908	218912	218899	218899	You	1424	" he continued , "
219088	219125	219076	219076	Frank	454	" Frank , who had been looking on with a stupid air at the papers , as they flamed in the old brazier , took out his sword and broke it , holding his head down : "
219132	219144	219145	219145	Marquis	2841	" says he , giving Esmond a grasp of the hand . "
219214	219215	219206	219206	you	1424	" "
219222	219239	219206	219206	you	1424	" says the young Prince , starting up , and speaking French in his eager way ; "
219327	219346	219349	219349	you	1424	" and the Prince took them out as eager as a boy , and held them towards Esmond : "
219358	219454	219354	219354	monsieur	4274	" Extremely touched by this immense mark of condescension and repentance for wrong done , Colonel Esmond bowed down so low as almost to kiss the gracious young hand that conferred on him such an honor , and took his guard in silence . The swords were no sooner met , than Castlewood knocked up Esmond 's with the blade of his own , which he had broke off short at the shell ; and the Colonel falling back a step dropped his point with another very low bow , and declared himself perfectly satisfied . "
219460	219476	219354	219354	monsieur	4274	" says the young Prince , who was a boy , and a French boy , "
219486	219506	219507	219507	We	11221	" he placed his sword upon the table , and the fingers of his two hands upon his breast : "
219515	219519	219354	219354	monsieur	4274	" says he ; "
219526	219533	219520	219520	you	1233	" He stretched out his arms : "
219537	219586	219587	219588	Charming Beatrix	1234	" The talk was scarce over when Beatrix entered the room : What came she to seek there ? She started and turned pale at the sight of her brother and kinsman , drawn swords , broken sword - blades , and papers yet smouldering in the brazier . "
219590	219604	219587	219588	Charming Beatrix	1234	" says the Prince , with a blush which became him very well , "
219791	219792	219782	219784	this poor Marquis	11239	" "
219804	219843	219796	219797	the King	1293	" was all Beatrix could say . The roses had shuddered out of her cheeks ; her eyes were glaring ; she looked quite old . She came up to Esmond and hissed out a word or two : "
219854	219858	219796	219797	the King	1293	" says she , "
219866	219951	219861	219861	I	0	" If words could stab , no doubt she would have killed Esmond ; she looked at him as if she could . But her keen words gave no wound to Mr. Esmond ; his heart was too hard . As he looked at her , he wondered that he could ever have loved her . His love of ten years was over ; it fell down dead on the spot , at the Kensington Tavern , where Frank brought him the note out of "
219955	220037	219861	219861	I	0	" The Prince blushed and bowed low , as she gazed at him , and quitted the chamber . I have never seen her from that day . Horses were fetched and put to the chariot presently . My lord rode outside , and as for Esmond he was so tired that he was no sooner in the carriage than he fell asleep , and never woke till night , as the coach came into Alton . As we drove to the "
220039	220160	219796	219797	the King	1293	" Inn comes a mitred coach with our old friend Lockwood beside the coachman . My Lady Castlewood and the Bishop were inside ; she gave a little scream when she saw us . The two coaches entered the inn almost together ; the landlord and people coming out with lights to welcome the visitors . We in our coach sprang out of it , as soon as ever we saw the dear lady , and above all , the Doctor in his cassock . What was the news ? Was there yet time ? Was the Queen alive ? These questions were put hurriedly , as Boniface stood waiting before his noble guests to bow them up the stair . "
220165	220177	219796	219797	the King	1293	" was what Lady Castlewood whispered in a flutter to Esmond . "
220185	220249	220183	220183	God	1113	" says he , as the fond lady took his hand and kissed it , and called him her preserver and her dear . SHE was n't thinking of Queens and crowns . The Bishop 's news was reassuring : at least all was not lost ; the Queen yet breathed , or was alive when they left London , six hours since . "
220259	221621	220252	220253	Lady Castlewood	1236	" the Doctor said . Argyle had marched up regiments from Portsmouth , and sent abroad for more ; the Whigs were on the alert , a pest on them , I am not sure but the Bishop swore as he spoke , and so too were our people . And all might be saved , if only the Prince could be at London in time . We called for horses , instantly to return to London . We never went up poor crestfallen Boniface 's stairs , but into our coaches again . The Prince and his Prime Minister in one , Esmond in the other , with only his dear mistress as a companion . Castlewood galloped forwards on horseback to gather the Prince 's friends and warn them of his coming . We travelled through the night . Esmond discoursing to his mistress of the events of the last twenty - four hours ; of Castlewood 's ride and his ; of the Prince 's generous behavior and their reconciliation . The night seemed short enough ; and the starlit hours passed away serenely in that fond company . So we came along the road ; the Bishop 's coach heading ours ; and , with some delays in procuring horses , we got to Hammersmith about four o'clock on Sunday morning , the first of August , and half an hour after , it being then bright day , we rode by my Lady Warwick 's house , and so down the street of Kensington . Early as the hour was , there was a bustle in the street and many people moving to and fro . Round the gate leading to the Palace , where the guard is , there was especially a great crowd . And the coach ahead of us stopped , and the Bishop 's man got down to know what the concourse meant ? There presently came from out of the gate Horse Guards with their trumpets , and a company of heralds with their tabards . The trumpets blew , and the herald - at - arms came forward and proclaimed GEORGE , by the Grace of God , of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , King , Defender of the Faith . And the people shouted God save the King ! Among the crowd shouting and waving their hats , I caught sight of one sad face , which I had known all my life , and seen under many disguises . It was no other than poor Mr. Holt 's , who had slipped over to England to witness the triumph of the good cause ; and now beheld its enemies victorious , amidst the acclamations of the English people . The poor fellow had forgot to huzzah or to take his hat off , until his neighbors in the crowd remarked his want of loyalty , and cursed him for a Jesuit in disguise , when he ruefully uncovered and began to cheer . Sure he was the most unlucky of men : he never played a game but he lost it ; or engaged in a conspiracy but ' twas certain to end in defeat . I saw him in Flanders after this , whence he went to Rome to the head - quarters of his Order ; and actually reappeared among us in America , very old , and busy , and hopeful . I am not sure that he did not assume the hatchet and moccasins there ; and , attired in a blanket and war - paint , skulk about a missionary amongst the Indians . He lies buried in our neighboring province of Maryland now , with a cross over him , and a mound of earth above him ; under which that unquiet spirit is for ever at peace . With the sound of King George 's trumpets , all the vain hopes of the weak and foolish young Pretender were blown away ; and with that music , too , I may say , the drama of my own life was ended . That happiness , which hath subsequently crowned it , can not be written in words ; ' tis of its nature sacred and secret , and not to be spoken of , though the heart be ever so full of thankfulness , save to Heaven and the One Ear alone to one fond being , the truest and tenderest and purest wife ever man was blessed with . As I think of the immense happiness which was in store for me , and of the depth and intensity of that love which , for so many years , hath blessed me , I own to a transport of wonder and gratitude for such a boon nay , am thankful to have been endowed with a heart capable of feeling and knowing the immense beauty and value of the gift which God hath bestowed upon me . Sure , love vincit omnia ; is immeasurably above all ambition , more precious than wealth , more noble than name . He knows not life who knows not that : he hath not felt the highest faculty of the soul who hath not enjoyed it . In the name of my wife I write the completion of hope , and the summit of happiness . To have such a love is the one blessing , in comparison of which all earthly joy is of no value ; and to think of her , is to praise God . It was at Bruxelles , whither we retreated after the failure of our plot our Whig friends advising us to keep out of the way that the great joy of my life was bestowed upon me , and that my dear mistress became my wife .
