6637	6650	6652	6652	Harold	144	" But straighter and more upright than some of the young ones ! "
6672	6701	6652	6652	Harold	144	" The old women at Smyrna are like sacks . You 've not got clumsy and shapeless . How is it I have the trick of getting fat ? "
6714	6735	6703	6703	Harold	144	" I remember my father was as thin as a herring . How is my father ? Where is he ? "
7063	7116	7061	7061	he	144	" Gad ! what a wreck poor father is ! Paralysis , eh ? Terribly shrunk and shaken crawls about among his books and beetles as usual , though . Well , it 's a slow and easy death . But he 's not much over sixty - five , is he ? "
7117	7136	7138	7139	Mrs. Transome	269	" Sixty - seven , counting by birthdays ; but your father was born old , I think , "
7181	7202	7169	7169	his	144	" But your little boy , Harold where is he ? How is it he has not come with you ? "
7203	7214	7216	7216	Harold	144	" Oh , I left him behind , in town , "
7224	7266	7216	7216	Harold	144	" My man Dominic will bring him , with the rest of the luggage . Ah , I see it is young Debarry , and not my old friend Sir Maximus , who is offering himself as candidate for North Loamshire . "
7267	7304	7169	7169	his	144	" Yes . You did not answer me when I wrote to you to London about your standing . There is no other Tory candidate spoken of , and you would have all the Debarry interest . "
7306	7312	7314	7314	Harold	144	" I hardly think that , "
7318	7334	7216	7216	Harold	144	" Why ? Jermyn says a Tory candidate can never be got in without it . "
7335	7345	7386	7387	Mrs. Transome	269	" But I shall not be a Tory candidate . "
7355	7359	7360	7360	she	269	" What then ? "
7366	7375	7360	7360	she	269	" You will not call yourself a Whig ? "

7584	7607	7635	7635	his	144	" Will you go to your rooms , Harold , and see if there is anything you would like to have altered ? "
7608	7615	7617	7617	Harold	144	" Yes , let us go , "
7646	7658	7659	7659	he	144	" Uncle Lingon is on the bench still , I see , "
7671	7683	7659	7659	he	144	" is he at home will he be here this evening ? "
7684	7746	7659	7659	he	144	" He says you must go to the rectory when you want to see him . You must remember you have come back to a family with old - fashioned notions . Your uncle thought I ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two . He remembered that I had not seen my son for fifteen years . "
7747	7759	7761	7761	Harold	144	" Ah , by Jove ! fifteen years so it is ! "
7788	7814	7776	7776	he	144	" And you are as straight as an arrow 18 still ; you will carry the shawls I have brought you as well as ever . "
7931	7942	7944	7945	Mrs. Transome	269	" I have given you the south rooms , Harold , "
7963	7994	7944	7945	Mrs. Transome	269	" I thought they would suit you best , as they all open into each other , and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting - room for you . "
7995	8006	8008	8008	Harold	144	" Gad ! the furniture is in a bad state , "
8022	8035	8008	8008	Harold	144	" the moths seem to have got into the carpets and hangings . "
8036	8050	8052	8053	Mrs. Transome	269	" I had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent , "
8055	8068	8052	8053	Mrs. Transome	269	" We have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited rooms . "
8069	8080	7944	7945	Mrs. Transome	269	" What ! you 've been rather pinched , eh ? "
8081	8095	8052	8053	Mrs. Transome	269	" You find us living as we have been living these twelve years . "
8096	8176	7944	7945	Mrs. Transome	269	" Ah , you 've had Durfey 's debts as well as the lawsuits confound them ! It will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages . However , he 's gone now , poor fellow ; and I suppose I should have spent more in buying an English estate some time or other . I always meant to be an Englishman , and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at Eton . "
8177	8199	8052	8053	Mrs. Transome	269	" I hardly thought you could have meant that , Harold , when I found you had married a foreign wife . "
8200	8252	7944	7945	Mrs. Transome	269	" Would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical Englishwoman , who would have hung all her relations around my neck ? I hate English wives ; they want to give their opinion about everything . They interfere with a man 's life . I shall not marry again . "
8303	8331	8300	8300	she	269	" I suppose you have been used to great luxury ; these rooms look miserable to you , but you can soon make any alterations you like . "
8332	8360	8361	8361	he	866	" Oh , I must have a private sitting - room fitted up for myself down - stairs . And the rest are bedrooms , I suppose , "
8371	8420	8300	8300	she	269	" Ah , I can sleep here a night or two . But there 's a bedroom down - stairs , with an ante - room , I remember , that would do for my man Dominic and the little boy . I should like to have that . "
8421	8456	8300	8300	she	269	" Your father has slept there for years . He will be like a distracted insect , and never know where to go , if you alter the track he has to walk in . "
8457	8470	8300	8300	she	269	" That 's a pity . I hate going up - stairs . "
8471	8507	8300	8300	she	269	" There is the steward 's room : it is not used , and might be turned into a bedroom . I ca n't offer you my room , for I sleep up - stairs . "
8530	8650	8300	8300	she	269	" No ; I 'm determined not to sleep up - stairs . We 'll see about the steward 's room to - morrow , and I dare say I shall find a closet of some sort for Dominic . It 's a nuisance he had to stay behind , for I shall have nobody to cook for me . Ah , there 's the old river I used to fish in . I often thought , when I was at Smyrna , that I would buy a park with a river through it as much like the Lapp as possible . Gad , what fine oaks those are opposite ! Some of them must come down , though . "
8651	8708	8300	8300	she	269	" I 've held every tree sacred on the demesne , as I told you , Harold . I trusted to your getting the estate some time , and releasing it ; and I determined to keep it worth releasing . A park without fine timber is no better than a beauty without teeth and hair . "
8709	8714	8716	8716	Harold	144	" Bravo , mother ! "
8725	8771	8716	8716	Harold	144	" Ah , you 've had to worry yourself about things that do n't properly belong to a woman my father being weakly . We 'll set all that right . You shall have nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions . "
8772	8831	8719	8719	his	144	" You must excuse me from the satin cushions . That is a part of the old woman 's duty I am not prepared for . I am used to be chief bailiff , and to sit in the saddle two or three hours every day . There are two farms on our hands besides the Home Farm . "
8832	8853	8855	8855	Harold	144	" Phew - ew ! Jermyn manages the estate badly , then . That will not last under my reign , "
8880	8892	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" Perhaps when you 've been in England a little longer , "
8906	8921	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" you will understand better the difficulty there is in letting farms these times . "
8922	8990	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" I understand the difficulty perfectly , mother . To let farms , a man must have the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers , and to get sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction I know of . I suppose if I ring there 's some fellow who can act as valet and learn to attend to my hookah ? "
8991	9021	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" There is Hickes the butler , and there is Jabez the footman ; those are all the men in the house . They were here when you left . "
9022	9071	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" Oh , I remember Jabez he was a dolt . I 'll have old Hickes . He was a neat little machine of a butler ; his words used to come like the clicks of an engine . He must be an old machine now , though . "
9072	9086	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" You seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well , Harold . "
9087	9145	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" Never forget places and people how they look and what can be done with them . All the country round here lies like a map in my brain . A deuced pretty country too ; but the people were a stupid set of old Whigs and Tories . I suppose they are much as they were . "
9146	9203	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" I am , at least , Harold . You are the first of your family that ever talked of being a Radical . I did not think I was taking care of our old oaks for that . I always thought Radicals ' houses stood staring above poor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles . "
9204	9224	9226	9226	Harold	144	" Yes , but the Radical sticks are growing , mother , and half the Tory oaks are rotting , "
9232	9245	9226	9226	Harold	144	" You 've arranged for Jermyn to be early to - morrow ? "
9246	9270	8894	8895	Mrs. Transome	269	" He will be here to breakfast at nine . But I leave you to Hickes now ; we dine in an hour . "
9510	9516	9517	9517	she	269	" I am a hag ! "
9533	9575	9517	9517	she	269	" an ugly old woman who happens to be his mother . That is what he sees in me , as I see a stranger in him . I shall count for nothing . I was foolish to expect anything else . "
9590	9595	9596	9596	she	269	" What a likeness ! "
9604	9617	9596	9596	she	269	" yet , perhaps , no one will see it besides me . "
10577	10579	10563	10563	she	269	" ways "
11472	11487	11489	11490	Mrs. Transome	269	" The bell has rung , then , Denner , without my hearing it ? "
11494	11499	11501	11501	Denner	162	" Yes , madam , "
11845	11866	11831	11831	She	269	" Mr. Harold is dressed ; he shook me by the hand in the corridor , and was very pleasant . "
11867	11880	11831	11831	She	269	" What an alteration , Denner ! No likeness to me now . "
11881	11972	11831	11831	She	269	" Handsome , though , spite of his being so browned and stout . There 's a fine presence about Mr. Harold . I remember you used to say , madam , there were some people you would always know were in the room though they stood round a corner , and others you might never see till you ran against them . That 's as true as truth . And as for likenesses , thirty - five and sixty are not much alike , only to people 's memories . "
11985	12022	11979	11979	Denner	162	" I do n't know how things will go on now , but it seems something too good to happen that they will go on well . I am afraid of ever expecting anything good again . "
12023	12083	11831	11831	She	269	" That 's weakness , madam . Things do n't happen because they 're bad or good , else all eggs would be addled or none at all , and at the most it is but six to the dozen . There 's good chances and bad chances , and nobody 's luck is pulled only by one string . "
12084	12135	11979	11979	Denner	162	" What a woman you are , Denner ! You talk like a French infidel . It seems to me you are afraid of nothing . I have been full of fears all my life always seeing something or other hanging over me that I could n't bear to happen . "
12136	12254	11831	11831	She	269	" Well , madam , put a good face on it , and do n't seem to be on the look - out for crows , else you 'll set other people watching . Here you have a rich son come home , and the debts will all be paid , and you have your health and can ride about , and you 've such a face and figure , and will have if you live to be eighty , that everybody is cap in hand to you before they know you who are ; let me fasten up your veil a little higher : there 's a good deal of pleasure in life for you yet . "
12255	12289	11979	11979	Denner	162	" Nonsense ! there 's no pleasure for old women , unless they get it out of tormenting other people . What are your pleasures , Denner besides being a slave to me ? "
12290	12473	11831	11831	She	269	" Oh , there 's pleasure in knowing one 's not a fool , like half the people one sees about . And managing one 's husband is some pleasure ; and doing all one 's business well . Why , if I 've only got some orange flowers to candy , I should n't like to die till I see them all right . Then there 's the sunshine now and then ; I like that as the cats do . I look upon it , life is like our game at whist , when Banks and his wife come to the still - room of an evening . I do n't enjoy the game much , but I like to play my cards well , and see what will be the end of it ; and I want to see you make the best of your hand , madam , for your luck has been mine these forty years now . But I must go and see how Kitty dishes up the dinner , unless you have any more commands . "
12474	12485	11979	11979	Denner	162	" No , Denner ; I am going down immediately . "
13666	13692	13656	13656	she	269	" It is a lucky eel that escapes skinning . The best happiness I shall ever know , will be to escape the worst misery . "
14032	14048	14013	14013	Harold	144	" I shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle Lingon . "
14049	14061	14013	14013	Harold	144	" Very well . He can answer more questions for you . "
14062	14065	14067	14067	Harold	144	" Yes , "
14087	14125	14067	14067	Harold	144	" I want to hear all about the game and the North Loamshire hunt . I 'm fond of sport ; we had a great deal of it at Smyrna , and it keeps down my fat . "
14359	14425	14355	14357	Mr. Matthew Jermyn	173	" A fat - handed , glib - tongued fellow , with a scented cambric handkerchief ; one of your educated low - bred fellows ; a foundling who got his Latin for nothing at Christ 's Hospital ; one of your middle - class upstarts who want to rank with gentlemen , and think they 'll do it with kid gloves and new furniture . "
14782	14811	14770	14771	a Whig	5613	" Why , lad , if the world was turned into a swamp , I suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings , and walk about like cranes "
14894	15171	14884	14884	he	1106	" If the mob ca n't be turned back , a man of family must try and head the mob , and save a few homes and hearths , and keep the country up on its last legs as long as he can . And you 're a man of family , my lad dash it ! You 're a Lingon , whatever else you may be , and I 'll stand by you . I 've no great interest ; I 'm a poor parson . I 've been forced to give up hunting ; my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies becoming my station that I can allow myself . But I 'll give you my countenance I 'll stick to you as my nephew . There 's no need for me to change sides exactly . I was born a Tory , and I shall never be a 32 bishop . But if anybody says you 're in the wrong , I shall say , ' My nephew is in the right ; he has turned Radical to save his country . If William Pitt had been living now he 'd have done the same ; for what did he say when he was dying ? Not ' Oh , save my party ! ' but ' Oh , save my country , heaven ! ' That was what they dinned in our ears about Peel and the Duke ; and now I 'll turn it round upon them . They shall be hoist with their own petard . Yes , yes , I 'll stand by you . "
15923	15931	15933	15933	Jermyn	173	" I congratulate you , Mrs. Transome , "
15942	15947	15948	15948	he	173	" all the more , "
15955	15983	15948	15948	he	173	" now I have the pleasure of actually seeing your son . I am glad to perceive that an Eastern climate has not been unfavorable to him . "
15984	15987	15989	15989	Harold	144	" No , "
16006	16070	15989	15989	Harold	144	" the question is , whether the English climate will agree with me . It 's deuced shifting and damp ; and as for the food , it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if the southern cooks would change their religion , get persecuted , and fly to England , as the old silk - weavers did . "
16071	16092	16094	16095	Mrs. Transome	269	" There are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay for them , I suppose , "
16097	16111	16094	16095	Mrs. Transome	269	" but they are unpleasant 34 people to have about one 's house . "
16112	16121	16123	16123	Harold	144	" Gad ! I do n't think so , "
16125	16136	15989	15989	Harold	144	" The old servants are sure to quarrel with them . "
16137	16178	16094	16095	Mrs. Transome	269	" That 's no concern of mine . The old servants will have to put up with my man Dominic , who will show them how to cook and do everything else in a way that will rather astonish them . "
16179	16195	15989	15989	Harold	144	" Old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways , Harold . "
16196	16209	16211	16211	Harold	144	" Well , they can give up and watch the young ones , "
16235	16245	16247	16247	Jermyn	173	" You have a valuable servant , it seems , "
16269	16393	16247	16247	Jermyn	173	" Oh , one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one 's life easy . He 's of no country in particular . I do n't know whether he 's most of a Jew , a Greek , an Italian , or a Spaniard . He speaks five or six languages , one as well as another . He 's cook , valet , major - domo , and secretary all in one ; and what 's more , he 's an affectionate fellow I can trust to his attachment . That 's a sort of human specimen that does n't grow here in England , I fancy . I should have been badly off if I could not have brought Dominic . "
16647	16657	16659	16659	Harold	144	" Well , what are the prospects about election ? "
16667	16693	16659	16659	Harold	144	" There are two Whigs and one Conservative likely to be in the field , I know . What is your opinion of the chances ? "
16772	16776	16777	16777	he	173	" My opinion , "
16780	16890	16777	16777	he	173	" is in a state of balance at present . This division of the county , you are aware , contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude , and several smaller ones . The manufacturing interest is widely dispersed . So far a there is a presumption a in favor of the two Liberal candidates . Still , with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts , such as those we have round us at Treby Magna , I think a the auguries a would not be unfavorable to the return of a Conservative . A fourth candidate of good position , who should coalesce with Mr. Debarry a "
16905	16964	16901	16901	Harold	144	" That will not be my line of action , so we need not discuss it . If I put up it will be as a Radical ; and I fancy , in any county that would return Whigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a Radical who offered himself with good pretensions . "
17027	17045	17020	17020	he	179	" I 'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly acquainted with English politics . "
17046	17052	17054	17054	Harold	144	" Oh , of course , "
17058	17135	17054	17054	Harold	144	" I 'm aware how things have been going on in England . I always meant to come back ultimately . I suppose I know the state of Europe as well as if I 'd been stationary at Little Treby for the last fifteen years . If a man goes to the East , 36 people seem to think he gets turned into something like the one - eyed calender in the ' Arabian Nights ! ' "
17136	17160	17162	17163	Mrs. Transome	269	" Yet I should think there are some things which people who have been stationary at Little Treby could tell you , Harold , "
17165	17255	17162	17163	Mrs. Transome	269	" It did not signify about your holding Radical opinions at Smyrna ; but you seem not to imagine how your putting up as a Radical will affect your position here , and the position of your family . No one will visit you . And then the sort of people who will support you ! You really have no idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a Radical . There are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced yourself . "
17256	17259	17261	17261	Harold	144	" Pooh ! "
17281	17436	17279	17279	her	269	" It seems to me that a man owes something to his birth and station , and has no right to take up this notion or other , just as it suits his fancy ; still less to work at the overthrow of his class . That was what every one said of Lord Grey , and my family at least is as good as Lord Grey 's . You have wealth now , and might distinguish yourself in the county ; and if you had been true to your colors as a gentleman , you would have had all the greater opportunity , because the times are so bad . The Debarrys and Lord Wyvern would have set all the more store by you . For my part , I ca n't conceive what good you propose to yourself . I only entreat you to think again before you take any decided step . "
17437	17440	17442	17442	Harold	144	" Mother , "
17475	17624	17451	17451	his	144	" it is natural that you should think in this way . Women , very properly , do n't change their views , but keep to the notions in which they have been brought up . It does n't signify what they think they are not called upon to judge or to act . You must leave me to take my own course in these matters , which properly belong to men . Beyond that , I will gratify any wish you may choose to mention . You shall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself ; you shall have the house done up in first - rate style , and I am not thinking of marrying . But let us understand that there shall be no further collision between us on subjects on which I must be master of my own actions . "
17625	17670	17451	17451	his	144	" And you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life , Harold . I do n't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight 37 thing she will be to her son when she is old . "
17819	17823	17806	17806	Harold	144	" You smoke ? "
17824	17849	17806	17806	Harold	144	" No , I always defer to the ladies . Mrs. Jermyn is peculiarly sensitive in such matters , and does n't like tobacco . "
17872	17898	17850	17850	Harold	144	" Confound the fellow with his Mrs. Jermyn ! Does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about his wife ? "
17899	17909	17910	17910	he	144	" Well , I took my hookah before breakfast , "
17939	17939	17928	17929	My father	5602	"
17940	17947	17949	17949	Harold	144	" Sit down , sit down , "
17988	18052	18053	18053	he	144	" The first question , Mr. Jermyn , now you know my intentions , is , whether you will undertake to be my agent in this election , and help me through ? There 's no time to be lost , and I do n't want to lose my chance , as I may not have another for seven years . I understand , "
18064	18087	18053	18053	he	144	" that you have not taken any conspicuous course in politics , and I know that Labron is agent for the Debarrys . "
18088	18251	18053	18053	he	144	" Oh a my dear sir a man necessarily has his political convictions , but of what use is it for a professional man a of some education , to talk of them in a little country town ? There really is no comprehension of public questions in such places . Party feeling , indeed , was quite asleep here before the agitation about the Catholic Relief Bill . It is true that I concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition against the Reform Bill , 38 but I did not state my reasons . The weak points in that Bill are a too palpable , and I fancy you and I should not differ much on that head . The fact is , when I knew that you were to come back to us , I kept myself in reserve , though I was much pressed by the friends of Sir James Clement , the Ministerial candidate , who is "
18252	18264	18266	18266	Harold	144	" However , you will act for me that 's settled ? "
18268	18271	18273	18273	Jermyn	179	" Certainly , "
18287	18306	18053	18053	he	144	" Which of the Liberal candidates , as they call themselves , has the better chance , eh ? "
18307	18347	18053	18053	he	144	" I was going to observe that Sir James Clement has not so good a chance as Mr. Garstin , supposing that a third Liberal candidate presents himself . There are two senses in which a politician can be liberal "
18352	18382	18349	18350	Mr. Jermyn	179	" Sir James Clement is a poor baronet , hoping for an appointment , and ca n't be expected to be liberal in that wider sense which commands majorities . "
18383	18396	18398	18398	Harold	144	" I wish this man were not so much of a talker , "
18400	18410	18411	18411	he	144	" he 'll bore me . We shall see , "
18415	18442	18411	18411	he	144	" what can be done in the way of combination . I 'll come down to your office after one o'clock if it will suit you ? "
18443	18446	18349	18350	Mr. Jermyn	179	" Perfectly . "
18447	18527	18411	18411	he	144	" Ah , and you 'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information ready for me there . I must get up a dinner for the tenants , and we can invite whom we like besides the tenants . Just now , I 'm going over one of the farms on hand with the bailiff . By the way , that 's a desperately bad business , having three farms unlet how comes that about , eh ? "
18528	18583	18349	18350	Mr. Jermyn	179	" That is precisely what I wanted to say a few words about to you . You have observed already how strongly Mrs. Transome takes certain things to heart . You can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways . Mr. Transome 's want of health ; Mr. Durfey 's habits a "
18584	18589	18411	18411	he	144	" Yes , yes . "
18783	18783	18766	18766	I	0	"
18784	18797	18799	18799	Harold	144	" I shall know what to do , sir , never fear , "
18804	18852	18799	18799	Harold	144	" You will pardon , I hope , a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a man of my age , who has been so long in a close connection with the family affairs a I have never considered that connection simply in a light of business a "
18853	18867	18869	18869	Harold	144	" Damn him , I 'll soon let him know that I do , "
18906	18913	18914	18914	he	144	" I understand , I understand , "
18918	18999	18914	18914	he	144	" You 've had more awkward business on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family lawyer . We shall set everything right by degrees . But now as to the canvassing . I 've made arrangements with a first - rate man in London , who understands these matters thoroughly a solicitor , of course he has carried no end of men into Parliament . I 'll engage him to meet us at Duffield say when ? "
19073	19086	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" Well , lad , how have you got on with Jermyn ? "
19087	19146	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" Oh , I do n't think I shall like the fellow . He 's a sort of amateur gentleman . But I must make use of him . I expect whatever I get out of him will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of us . But I shall see . "
19147	19292	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" Ay , ay , use his gun to bring down your game , and after that , beat the thief with the butt end . That 's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in one talking between ourselves as uncle and nephew . But I say , Harold , I was going to tell you , now I come to think of it , this is 40 rather a nasty business , your calling yourself a Radical . I 've been turning it over in after - dinner speeches , but it looks awkward it 's not what people are used to it wants a good deal of Latin to make it go down . I shall be worried about it at the sessions , and I can think of nothing neat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer . "
19293	19328	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" Nonsense , uncle ! I remember what a good speechifier you always were ; you 'll never be at a loss . You only want a few more evenings to think of it . "
19329	19365	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" But you 'll not be attacking the Church and the institutions of the country you 'll not be going those lengths ; you 'll keep up the bulwarks , and so on , eh ? "
19366	19397	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" No , I sha n't attack the Church , only the incomes of the bishops , perhaps , to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy . "
19398	19472	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" Well , well , I have no objection to that . Nobody likes our bishop : he 's all Greek and greediness ; too proud to dine with his own father . You may pepper the bishops a little . But you 'll respect the constitution handed down , etc . and you 'll rally round the throne and the King , God bless him , and the usual toasts , eh ? "
19473	19490	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" Of course , of course . I am a Radical only in rooting out abuses . "
19491	19502	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" That 's the word I wanted , my lad ! "
19512	19545	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" That 's a spool to wind a speech on . Abuses is the very word ; and if anybody shows himself offended , he 'll put the cap on for himself . "
19546	19553	19555	19555	Harold	144	" I remove the rotten timbers , "
19560	19570	19555	19555	Harold	144	" and substitute fresh oak , that 's all . "
19571	19640	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" Well done , my boy ! By George , you 'll be a speaker ! But I say , Harold , I hope you 've got a little Latin left . This young Debarry is a tremendous fellow at the classics , and walks on stilts to any length . He 's one of the new Conservatives . Old Sir Maximus does n't understand him at all . "
19641	19650	19652	19652	Harold	144	" That wo n't do at the hustings , "
19654	19666	19652	19652	Harold	144	" He 'll get knocked off his stilts pretty quickly there . "
19667	19726	19504	19505	the vicar	1207	" Bless me ! it 's astonishing how well you 're up in the affairs of the country , my boy . But rub up a few quotations ' Quod turpe bonis decebat Crispinum ' and that sort of thing just to show Debarry what you could do if you liked . But you want to ride on ? "
19727	19741	19652	19652	Harold	144	" Yes ; I have an appointment at Treby . Good - bye . "
19742	19749	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" He 's a cleverish chap , "
19759	19876	19751	19752	the vicar	1207	" When he 's had plenty of English exercise , and brought out his knuckle a 41 bit , he 'll be a Lingon again as he used to be . I must go and see how Arabella takes his being a Radical . It 's a little awkward ; but a clergyman must keep peace in a family . Confound it ! I 'm not bound to love Toryism better than my own flesh and blood , and the manor I shoot over . That 's a heathenish , Brutus - like sort of thing , as if Providence could n't take care of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister 's son ! "

Do you think there will be a great shout for the right the shout of a nation as of one man , rounded and whole , like the voice of the archangel that bound together all the listeners of earth and heaven if every Christian of you peeps round to see what his neighbors in good coats are doing , or else puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard ? But this is what you do : when the servant of God stands up 49 to deliver his message , do you lay your souls beneath the Word as you set out your plants beneath the fallen rain ? No ; one of you sends his eyes to all corners , he smothers his soul with small questions , ' What does brother Y. think ? ' ' Is this doctrine high enough for brother Z. ? ' ' Will the church members be pleased ? ' And another "

It is a stumbling - block and offence to my daughter ; she would take no broth yesterday , because she said you had cried into it . Thus you cause the truth to be lightly spoken of , and make the enemy rejoice . If your faceache gives him an advantage , take a little warm ale with your meat I do not grudge the money . "

24128	24195	24118	24126	the minister , again thinking aloud , and walking	1456	" Their needs lie too much out of the track of my meditations , and take me often unawares . Mistress Holt is another who darkens counsel by words without knowledge , and angers the reason of the natural man . Lord , give me patience . My sins were heavier to bear than this woman 's folly . Come in , Mrs. Holt come in . "
24306	24317	24318	24318	he	208	" You have something on your mind , Mrs. Holt ? "
24324	24338	24640	24641	Mrs. Holt	205	" Indeed I have , sir , else I should n't be here . "
24339	24343	24508	24509	the minister	1433	" Speak freely . "
24344	24418	24640	24641	Mrs. Holt	205	" It 's well known to you , Mr. Lyon , that my husband , Mr. Holt , came from the north , and was a member in Malthouse Yard long before you began to be pastor of it , which was seven year ago last Michaelmas . It 's the truth , Mr. Lyon , and I 'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it was n't true . "
24419	24426	24508	24509	the minister	1433	" Certainly , it is true . "
24427	24494	24640	24641	Mrs. Holt	205	" And if my husband had been alive when you 'd come to preach upon trial , he 'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as Mr. Nuttwood or Mr. Muscat , though whether he 'd have agreed with some that your doctrine was n't high enough , I ca n't say . For myself , I 've my opinion about high doctrine . "
24495	24506	24508	24509	the minister	1433	" Was it my preaching you came to speak about ? "
24516	24639	24640	24641	Mrs. Holt	205	" No , Mr. Lyon , I 'm not that woman . But this I will say , for my husband died before your time , that he had a wonderful gift in prayer , as the old members well know , if anybody likes to ask 'em , not believing my words , and he believed himself that the receipt for the Cancer Cure , which I 've sent out in bottles till this very last April before September as now is , and have bottles standing by me he believed it was sent to him in answer to prayer ; and nobody can deny it , for he prayed most regular , and read out of the green baize Bible . "
24661	24672	24674	24675	Mr. Lyon	208	" Has any one been aspersing your husband 's character ? "
24693	24857	24508	24509	the minister	1433	" Sir , they daredn't . For though he was a man of prayer , he did n't want skill and knowledge to find things out for himself ; and that 's what I used to say to my friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from Lancashire , with no trade nor fortune , but what he 'd got in his head . But my husband 's tongue ' ud have been a fortune to anybody , and there was many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk ; not but what that got him into trouble in Lancashire , but he always said , if the worst came to the worst , he could go and preach to the blacks . But he did better than that , Mr. Lyon , for he married me ; and this I will say , that for age , and conduct , and managing "
24859	24863	24865	24866	the minister	1433	" Mistress Holt , "
24868	24901	24865	24866	the minister	1433	" these are not the things whereby we may edify one another . Let me beg of you to be as brief as you can . My time is not my own . "
24902	25230	25231	25232	Mrs. Holt	205	" Well , Mr. Lyon , I 've a right to my own character ; and I 'm one of your congregation , though I 'm not a church member , for I was born in the General Baptist connection : and as for being saved without works , there 's a many , I dare say , ca n't do without that doctrine ; but I thank the Lord I never needed to put myself on a level with the thief on the cross . I 've done my duty , and more , if anybody comes to that ; for I 've gone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbor : and if there 's any of the church members say they 've done the same , I 'd ask them if they had the sinking at the stomach as I have ; for I 've ever strove to do the right thing , and more , for good - natured I always was ; and I little thought , after being respected by everybody , I should come to be reproached by my own son . And my husband said , when he was a - dying ' Mary , ' he said , ' the Elixir , and the Pills , and the Cure will support you , for they 've a great name in all the country round , and you 'll pray for a blessing on them . ' And so I 've done , Mr. Lyon ; and to say they 're not good medicines , when they 've been taken for fifty miles round by high and low , rich and poor , and nobody speaking against 'em but Dr. Lukin , it seems to me it 's a flying in the face of Heaven ; for if it was wrong to take the medicines , could n't the blessed Lord have stopped it ? "
25323	25355	25283	25283	she	205	" Am I wrong in gathering from what you say , Mistress Holt , that your son has objected in some way to your sale of your late husband 's medicines ? "
25356	25566	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" Mr. Lyon , he 's masterful beyond everything , and he talks more than his father did . I 've got my reason , Mr. Lyon , and if anybody talks sense I can follow him ; but Felix talks so wild , and contradicts his mother . And what do you think he says , after giving up his ' prenticeship , and going off to study at Glasgow , and getting through all the bit of money his 52 father saved for his bringing - up what has all his learning come to ? He says I 'd better never open my Bible , for it 's as bad poison to me as the pills are to half the people as swallow 'em . You 'll not speak of this again , Mr. Lyon I do n't think ill enough of you to believe that . For I suppose a Christian can understand the word o ' God without going to Glasgow , and there 's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine , and there 's one as might have been for a receipt of my husband 's it 's just as if it was a riddle , and Holt 's Elixir was the answer . "
25567	25577	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" Your son uses rash words , Mistress Holt , "
25582	25678	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" but it is quite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the Scripture . The word of God has to satisfy the larger needs of His people , like the rain and the sunshine which no man must think to be meant for his own patch of seed - ground solely . Will it not be well that I should see your son , and talk with him on these matters ? He was at chapel , I observe , and I suppose I am to be his pastor . "
25679	25869	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" That was what I wanted to ask you , Mr. Lyon . For perhaps he 'll listen to you , and not talk you down as he does his poor mother . For after we 'd been to chapel , he spoke better of you than he does of most : he said you was a fine old fellow , and an old - fashioned Puritan he uses dreadful language , Mr. Lyon ; but I saw he did n't mean you ill , for all that . He calls most folks 's religion rottenness ; and yet another time he 'll tell me I ought to feel myself a sinner , and do God 's will and not my own . But it 's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to abuse his mother . Or else he 's going off his head , and must be sent to a ' sylum . But if he writes to the North Loamshire Herald first , to tell everybody the medicines are good for nothing , how can I ever keep him and myself ? "
25870	25887	25889	25890	Mr. Lyon	208	" Tell him I shall feel favored if he will come and see me this evening , "
25922	25994	25907	25908	the preacher	1453	" Meanwhile , my friend , I counsel you to send up a supplication , which I shall not fail to offer also , that you may receive a spirit of humility and submission , so that you may not be hindered from seeing and following the Divine guidance in this matter by any false lights of pride and obstinacy . Of this more when I have spoken with your son . "
25995	26115	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" I 'm not proud or obstinate , Mr. Lyon . I never did say I was everything that was bad , and I never will . And why this trouble should be sent on 53 me above everybody else for I have n't told you all . He 's made himself a journeyman to Mr. Prowd the watchmaker after all this learning and he says he 'll go with patches on his knees , and he shall like himself the better . And as for him having little boys to teach , they 'll come in all weathers with dirty shoes . If it 's madness , Mr. Lyon , it 's no use your talking to him . "
26116	26153	25907	25908	the preacher	1453	" We shall see . Perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace within him . We must not judge rashly . Many eminent servants of God have been led by ways as strange . "
26154	26425	25579	25580	the minister	1433	" Then I 'm sorry for their mothers , that 's all , Mr. Lyon ; and all the more if they 'd been well - spoken - on women . For not my biggest enemy , whether it 's he or she , if they 'll speak the truth , can turn round and say I 've deserved this trouble . And when everybody gets their due , and people 's doings are spoke of on the house - tops , as the Bible says they will be , it 'll be known what I 've gone through with those medicines the pounding and the pouring , and the letting stand , and the weighing up early and down late there 's nobody knows yet but One that 's worthy to know ; and the pasting o ' the printed labels right side upwards . There 's few women would have gone through with it ; and it 's reasonable to think it 'll be made up to me ; for if there 's promised and purchased blessings , I should think this trouble is purchasing 'em . For if my son Felix does n't have a strait - waistcoat put on him , he 'll have his way . But I say no more . I wish you good - morning , Mr. Lyon , and thank you , though I well know it 's your duty to act as you 're doing . And I never troubled you about my own soul , as some do who look down on me for not being a church member . "
26426	26448	25907	25908	the preacher	1453	" Farewell , Mistress Holt , farewell . I pray that a more powerful teacher than I am may instruct you . "
26468	26581	26455	26459	the much - tried Rufus	1466	" This woman has sat under the Gospel all her life , and she is as blind as a heathen , and as proud and stiff - necked as a Pharisee ; yet she is one of the souls I watch for . ' Tis true that even Sara , the chosen mother of God 's people , showed a spirit of unbelief , and perhaps of selfish anger ; and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet , ' doing honor to the wife or woman , as unto the weaker vessel . ' For therein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural man . "
26732	26736	26689	26689	he	208	" Hm - m "
26986	27033	26982	26982	he	1433	" You are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax - light , my young friend ; but this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter , who is so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her . "
27034	27063	26982	26982	he	1433	" I heeded not the candle , sir . I thank Heaven I am not a mouse to have a nose that takes note of wax or tallow . "
27140	27152	27153	27153	he	1479	" And I myself , in fact , am equally indifferent , "
27176	27186	27153	27153	he	1479	" Here his large eyes looked discerningly through the spectacles .
27187	27204	27206	27206	Felix	134	" ' Tis the quality of the page you care about , not of the candle , "
27215	27231	27206	27206	Felix	134	" You 're thinking that you have a roughly - written page before you now . "
27337	27348	27349	27349	he	1433	" I abstain from judging by the outward appearance only , "
27357	27467	27349	27349	he	1433	" I myself have experienced that when the spirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neck - bands and strings and such small accidents of our vesture , which are nevertheless decent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh . And you , too , my young friend , as I gather from your mother 's troubled and confused report , are undergoing some travail of mind . You will not , I trust , object to open yourself fully to me , as to an aged pastor who has himself had much inward wrestling , and has especially known much temptation from doubt . "
27468	27473	27475	27475	Felix	134	" As to doubt , "
27483	27608	27475	27475	Felix	134	" if it is those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has been talking of to you and I suppose it is I 've no more doubt about them than I have about pocket - picking . I know there 's a stage of speculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is blameworthy but I 'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at the world through their own legs . If I allowed the sale of those medicines to go on , and my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can keep her by the honest labor of my hands , I 've not the least doubt that I should be a rascal . "
27610	27624	27626	27627	Mr. Lyon	208	" I would fain enquire more particularly into your objection to these medicines , "
27672	27801	27666	27666	he	208	" I know they have been well reported of , and many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by those who are not regular physicians , and have found a blessing in the use of them . I may mention the eminent Mr. Wesley , who , though I hold not altogether with his Arminian doctrine , nor with the usages of his institutions , was nevertheless a man of God ; and the journals of various Christians whose names have left a sweet savor , might be cited in the same sense . Moreover , your father , who originally concocted these medicines and left them as a provision for your mother , was , as I understand , a man whose walk was not unfaithful . "
27802	27808	27810	27810	Felix	134	" My father was ignorant , "
27814	27950	27810	27810	Felix	134	" He knew neither the complication of the human system , nor the way in which drugs counteract each other . Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug , but when it prescribes pills it may happen to do more harm . I know something about these things . I was ' prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute of a country apothecary my poor father left money for that he thought nothing could be finer for me . No matter : I know that the Cathartic Pills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the people who swallow them ; that the Elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen incompatible things ; and that the Cancer Cure might as well be bottled ditch - water . "
28007	28018	27997	27997	he	208	" How long have you known this , young man ? "
28019	28025	28027	28027	Felix	134	" Well put , sir , "
28029	28057	28027	28027	Felix	134	" I 've known it a good deal longer than I have acted upon it , like plenty of other things . But you believe in conversion ? "
28058	28063	28087	28087	he	1433	" Yea , verily . "
28064	28077	28027	28027	Felix	134	" So do I. I was converted by six weeks ' debauchery . "
28082	28086	28087	28087	he	1433	" Young man , "
28120	28120	28087	28087	he	1433	"
28121	28128	28130	28130	Felix	134	" I 'm not speaking lightly , "
28132	28383	28130	28130	Felix	134	" If I had not seen that I was making a hog of myself very fast , and that pig - wash , even if I could have got plenty of it , was a poor sort of thing , I should never have looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it . I laughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me , in a Scotch garret , with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be dissipated upon , with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below , and old women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs wanting to turn my life into easy pleasure . Then I began to see what else it could be turned into . Not much , perhaps . This world is not a very fine place for a good many of the people in it . But I 've made up my mind it sha n't be the worse for me , if I can help it . They may tell me I ca n't alter the world that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it , and if I do n't lie and filch somebody else will . Well then , somebody else shall , for I wo n't . That 's the upshot of my conversion , Mr. Lyon , if you want to know it . "
28398	28411	28387	28387	his	208	" Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow , young man ? "
28412	28432	28387	28387	his	208	" No : I heard most of the preachers once , but I never wanted to hear them twice . "
28491	28499	28500	28500	he	206	" And now , may I ask , "
28503	28661	28500	28500	he	206	" what course you mean to take , after hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs ? I speak no more in their favor after what you have said . God forbid that I should strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and honorable . But your mother is advanced in years ; she needs comfortable sustenance ; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends ? ' He that provideth not for his own ' I trust you respect the authority that so speaks . And I will not suppose that , after being tender of conscience toward strangers , you will be careless toward your mother . There be indeed some who , taking a mighty charge on their 58 shoulder , must perforce leave their households to Providence , and to the care of humbler brethren , but in such a case the call must be clear . "
28662	28732	29044	29045	Mr. Lyon	208	" I shall keep my mother as well nay , better than she has kept herself . She has always been frugal . With my watch and clock cleaning , and teaching one or two little chaps that I 've got to come to me , I can earn enough . As for me , I can live on bran porridge . I have the stomach of a rhinoceros . "
28733	28867	28500	28500	he	206	" But for a young man so well furnished as you , who can questionless write a good hand and keep books , were it not well to seek some higher situation as clerk or assistant ? I could speak to Brother Muscat , who is well acquainted with all such openings . Any place in Pendrell 's Bank , I fear , is now closed against such as are not Churchmen . It used not to be so , but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin , although he was a valuable servant . Still , something might be found . There are ranks and degrees and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly change what seems to be a providential appointment . Your poor mother is not altogether "
28868	29043	29044	29045	Mr. Lyon	208	" Excuse me , Mr. Lyon ; I 've had all that out with my mother , and I may as well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up about that a long while ago . I 'll take no employment that obliges me to prop up my chin with a high cravat , and wear straps , and pass the livelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt pins . That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts ; it only happens to be paid out of proportion . That 's why I set myself to learn the watchmaking trade . My father was a weaver first of all . It would have been better for him if he had remained a weaver . I came home through Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still . I mean to stick to the class I belong to people who do n't follow the fashions . "
29097	29102	29103	29103	he	208	" Well , well , "
29108	29135	29103	29103	he	208	" it is true that St. Paul exercised the trade of tent - making , though he was learned in all the wisdom of the Rabbis . "
29136	29144	29146	29146	Felix	134	" St. Paul was a wise man , "
29148	29233	29146	29146	Felix	134	" Why should I want to get into the middle class because I have some learning ? The most of the middle class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that 59 does n't belong to their own Brummagem life . That 's how the workingmen are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves : the best heads among them forsake their boon comrades , and go in for a house with a high door - step and a brass knocker . "
29291	29294	29295	29295	he	208	" Nevertheless , "
29300	29378	29295	29295	he	208	" it is by such self - advancement that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty and to the public well - being . The ring and the robe of Joseph were no objects for a good man 's ambition , but they were the signs of that credit which he won by his divinely - inspired skill , and which enabled him to act as a saviour to his brethren . "
29379	29521	29616	29617	the minister	1433	" Oh , yes , your ringed and scented men of the people ! I wo n't be one of them . Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock , and he 'll get new wants and new motives . Metamorphosis will have begun at his neck - joint , and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and then his reasoning , which will follow his likings as the feet of a hungry dog follow his nose . I 'll have none of your clerkly gentility . I might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine coat and a glutton 's dinner , on pretence of serving the poor men . I 'd sooner be Paley 's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach , though "
29529	29546	29525	29525	his	1494	" I should like well enough to be another sort of demagogue , if I could . "
29547	29563	29565	29566	Mr. Lyon	208	" Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of these times ? "
29576	29604	29616	29617	the minister	1433	" I should think so . I despise every man who has not or , having it , does n't try to rouse it in other men . "
29605	29614	29616	29617	the minister	1433	" Right , my young friend , right , "
29681	29820	29958	29959	Mr. Lyon	208	" That is my own view , which I maintain in the face of some opposition from 60 brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to the closer walk , and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their duties as members of the commonwealth . I have had much puerile blame cast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and Wellington in the pulpit . Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh ? and why not Brougham as well as Balaam ? Does God know less of men than He did in the days of Hezekiah and Moses ? is His arm shortened , and is the world become too wide for His providence ? But , they say , there are no politics in the New Testament "
29821	29830	29832	29832	Felix	134	" Well , they 're right enough there , "
29839	29862	29864	29865	Mr. Lyon	208	" What ! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not meddle with public matters in the pulpit ? "
29869	29880	29864	29865	Mr. Lyon	208	" I am ready to join issue on that point . "
29881	29887	29889	29889	Felix	134	" Not I , sir , "
29891	29951	29889	29889	Felix	134	" I should say , teach any truth you can , whether it 's in the Testament or out of it . It 's little enough anybody can get hold of , and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a pence - counting , parcel - tying generation , such as mostly fill your chapels . "
29952	29956	29958	29959	Mr. Lyon	208	" Young man , "
30003	30318	29986	29986	he	208	" I speak not on my own behalf , for not only have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , but I am aware of much that should make me patient under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction . I speak not as claiming reverence for my own age and office not to shame you , but to warn you . It is good that you should use plainness of speech , and I am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young , that they themselves , being elders , may be heard at large ; but Elihu was the youngest of Job 's friends , yet was there a wise rebuke in his words ; and the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel . I have to keep a special watch over myself in this matter , inasmuch as I have need of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent - up fire , until I have shot it forth , as it were , in arrowy words , each one hitting its mark . Therefore I pray for a listening spirit , which is a great mark of grace . Nevertheless , my young friend , I am bound , as I 61 said , to warn you . The temptations that most beset those who have great natural gifts , and are wise after the flesh , are pride and scorn , more particularly toward those weak things of the world which have been chosen to confound the things which are mighty . The scornful nostril and the high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth . The mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is "
30345	30381	30342	30342	he	208	" Is , I may say , as a clenched fist that can give blows , but is shut up from receiving and holding aught that is precious though it were heaven - sent manna . "
30382	30389	30391	30391	Felix	134	" I understand you , sir , "
30424	30437	30413	30413	he	208	" But I 'm not inclined to clench my fist at you . "
30438	30443	30445	30446	Mr. Lyon	208	" Well , well , "
30453	30523	30445	30446	Mr. Lyon	208	" we shall see more of each other , and I trust shall have much profitable communing . You will stay and have a dish of tea with us : we take the meal late on Thursdays , because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the French tongue . But she is doubtless returned now , and will presently come and pour out tea for us . "
30524	30532	30534	30534	Felix	134	" Thank you , I 'll stay , "
30636	30649	30650	30650	he	1504	" I 'm perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing , "
30654	30730	30650	30650	he	1504	" a phrenologist at Glasgow told me I had large veneration ; another man there , who knew me , laughed out and said I was the most blasphemous iconoclast living . ' That , ' says my phrenologist , ' is because of his large ideality , which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough to be venerated . ' Of course I put my ears down and wagged my tail at that stroking . "
30731	30831	30650	30650	he	1504	" Yes , yes ; I have had my own head explored with somewhat similar results . It is , I fear , but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen precept , ' Know thyself , ' and too often leads to a self - estimate which will subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality 62 of the tree is made evident . Nevertheless Esther , my dear , this is Mr. Holt , whose acquaintance I have now been making with more than ordinary interest . He will take tea with us . "
31038	31041	31043	31044	Mr. Lyon	208	" Nevertheless , "
31055	31118	31043	31044	Mr. Lyon	208	" that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the revealed dispensations . And it is undeniable that we have our varying native dispositions which even grace will not obliterate . I myself , from my youth up , have been given to question too curiously concerning the truth to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply it . "
31119	31144	31146	31146	Felix	134	" If your truth happens to be such medicine as Holt 's Pills and Elixir , the less you swallow of it the better , "
31148	31188	31146	31146	Felix	134	" But truth - vendors and medicine - vendors usually recommend swallowing . When a man sees his livelihood in a pill or a proposition , he likes to have orders for the dose , and not curious enquiries . "
31251	31260	31240	31240	she	1499	" The tea is poured out , father . "
31364	31376	31378	31379	the minister	1433	" Will you draw up to the table , Mr. Holt ? "
31457	31463	31465	31465	Felix	134	" Oh , my stars ! "
31467	31473	31465	31465	Felix	134	" I beg your pardon . "
31542	31547	31548	31548	he	208	" Byron 's Poems ! "
31566	31593	31548	31548	he	208	" ' The Dream ' he 'd better have been asleep and snoring . What ! do you stuff your memory with Byron , Miss Lyon ? "
31654	31663	31648	31648	she	214	" I have a great admiration for Byron . "
31724	31736	31738	31739	Mr. Lyon	208	" He is a worldly and vain writer , I fear , "
31763	31768	31770	31770	Felix	134	" A misanthropic debauchee , "
31788	31833	31770	31770	Felix	134	" whose notion of a hero was 64 that he should disorder his stomach and despise mankind . His corsairs and renegades , his Alps and Manfreds , are the most paltry puppets that were ever pulled by the strings of lust and pride . "
31834	31841	31843	31844	Mr. Lyon	208	" Hand the book to me , "
31846	31862	31864	31864	Esther	214	" Let me beg of you to put it aside till after tea , father , "
31866	31892	31864	31864	Esther	214	" However objectionable Mr. Holt may find its pages , they would certainly be made worse by being greased with bread - and - butter . "
31893	31901	31903	31904	Mr. Lyon	208	" That is true , my dear , "
31925	31930	31932	31932	Felix	134	" Ho , ho ! "
31934	31971	31932	31932	Felix	134	" her father is frightened at her . How came he to have such a nice - stepping , long - necked peacock for his daughter ? but she shall see that I am not frightened . "
31977	31997	31973	31973	he	208	" I should like to know how you will justify your admiration for such a writer , Miss Lyon . "
31998	32010	32012	32012	Esther	214	" I should not attempt it with you , Mr. Holt , "
32014	32055	32012	32012	Esther	214	" You have such strong words at command that they make the smallest argument seem formidable . If I had ever met the giant Cormoran , I should have made a point of agreeing with him in his literary opinions . "
32103	32115	32117	32118	the minister	1433	" My daughter is a critic of words , Mr. Holt , "
32123	32212	32117	32118	the minister	1433	" and often corrects mine on the ground of niceties , which I profess are as dark to me as if they were the reports of a sixth sense which I possess not . I am an eager seeker for precision , and would fain find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the soul 's pathways , but I see not why a round word that means some object , made and blessed by the Creator , should be branded and banished as a malefactor . "
32213	32224	32226	32226	Felix	134	" Oh , your niceties I know what they are , "
32233	32316	32226	32226	Felix	134	" They 'll go on your system of make - believe . ' Rottenness ' may suggest what is unpleasant , so you 'd better say ' sugar - plums , ' or something else such a long way off the fact that nobody is obliged to think of it . Those are your roundabout euphuisms that dress up swindling till it looks as well as honesty , and shoot with boiled peas instead of bullets . I hate your gentlemanly speakers . "
32318	32330	32332	32332	Esther	214	" Then you would not like Mr. Jermyn , I think , "
32334	32418	32332	32332	Esther	214	" That reminds me , father , that to - day , when I was giving Miss Louisa Jermyn her lesson , Mr. Jermyn came in and spoke to me with grand politeness , and asked me at what times you were likely to be disengaged , because he wished to make your better acquaintance , and consult you on matters of importance . He never took the least notice of me before . Can you guess the reason of his sudden ceremoniousness ? "
32419	32424	32426	32427	the minister	1433	" Nay , child , "
32431	32437	32439	32439	Felix	134	" Politics , of course , "
32441	32483	32439	32439	Felix	134	" He 's on some committee . An election is coming . Universal peace is declared , and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry . Eh , Mr. Lyon ? Is n't that it ? "
32484	32573	32332	32332	Esther	214	" Nay , not so . He is the close ally of the Transome family , who are blind hereditary Tories like the Debarrys , and will drive their tenants to the poll as if they were sheep , and it has even been hinted that the heir who is coming from the East may be another Tory candidate , and coalesce with the younger Debarry . It is said that he has enormous wealth , and could purchase every vote in the county that has a price . "
32574	32579	32581	32581	Esther	214	" He is come , "
32583	32604	32581	32581	Esther	214	" I heard Miss Jermyn tell her sister that she had seen him going out of her father 's room . "
32605	32610	32612	32613	Mr. Lyon	208	" ' Tis strange , "
32615	32622	32624	32624	Esther	214	" Something extraordinary must have happened , "
32626	32730	32624	32624	Esther	214	" for Mr. Jermyn to intend courting us . Miss Jermyn said to me only the other day that she could not think how I came to be so well educated and ladylike . She always thought Dissenters were ignorant , vulgar people . I said , so they were , usually , and Church people also in small towns . She considers herself a judge of what is ladylike , and she is vulgarity personified with large feet , and the most odious scent on her handkerchief , and a bonnet that looks like ' The Fashion ' printed in capital letters . "
32731	32744	32746	32746	Felix	134	" One sort of fine - ladyism is as good as another , "
32748	32756	32758	32758	Esther	214	" No , indeed . Pardon me , "
32760	32804	32758	32758	Esther	214	" A real fine - lady does not wear clothes that flare in people 's eyes , or use importunate scents , or make a noise as she moves : she is something refined and graceful , and charming , and never obtrusive . "
32805	32810	32812	32812	Felix	134	" Oh , yes , "
32816	32846	32812	32812	Felix	134	" And she reads Byron also , and admires Childe Harold gentlemen of unspeakable woes , who employ a hairdresser , and look seriously at themselves in the glass . "
32862	32922	32857	32857	Felix	134	" A fine - lady is a squirrel - headed thing , with small airs , and small notions , about as applicable to the business of life as a pair of tweezers to the clearing of a forest . Ask your father what those old persecuted emigrant Puritans would have done with fine - lady wives and daughters . "
32923	32934	32936	32936	Esther	214	" Oh , there is no danger of such mťsalliances , "
32938	32961	32936	32936	Esther	214	" Men who are unpleasant companions and make frights of themselves , are sure to get wives tasteless enough to suit them . "
32962	32968	32970	32971	Mr. Lyon	208	" Esther , my dear , "
32973	33010	32970	32971	Mr. Lyon	208	" let not your playfulness betray you into disrespect toward those venerable pilgrims . They struggled and endured in order to cherish and plant anew the seeds of a scriptural doctrine and of a pure discipline . "
33011	33017	33019	33019	Esther	214	" Yes , I know , "
33031	33040	33041	33041	Felix	134	" Oh , they were an ugly lot ! "
33050	33099	33041	33041	Felix	134	" Miss Medora would n't have minded if they had all been put into the pillory and lost their ears . She would have said , ' Their ears did stick out so . ' I should n't wonder if that 's a bust of one of them . "
33122	33125	33127	33128	Mr. Lyon	208	" No , "
33130	33224	33127	33128	Mr. Lyon	208	" that is the eminent George Whitfield , who , you well know , had a gift of oratory as of one on whom the tongue of flame had rested visibly . But Providence doubtless for wise ends in relation to the inner man , for I would not enquire too closely into minutia which carry too many plausible interpretations for any one of them to be stable Providence , I say , ordained that the good man should squint ; and my daughter has not yet learned to bear with his infirmity . "
33225	33240	33242	33242	Felix	134	" She has put a veil over it . Suppose you had squinted yourself ? "
33248	33265	33267	33267	Esther	214	" Then , doubtless , you could have been more polite to me , Mr. Holt , "
33279	33290	33267	33267	Esther	214	" You seem to prefer what is unusual and ugly . "
33291	33295	33297	33297	Felix	134	" A peacock ! "
33299	33322	33297	33297	Felix	134	" I should like to come and scold her every day , and make her cry and cut her fine hair off . "
33331	33357	33323	33323	Felix	134	" I will not take up any more of your valuable time , Mr. Lyon . I know that you have not many spare evenings . "
33359	33451	33323	33323	Felix	134	" That is true , my young friend ; for I now go to Sproxton one evening in the week . I do not despair that we may some day need a chapel there , though the hearers do not multiply save among the women , and there is no work as yet begun among the miners themselves . I shall be glad of your company in my walk thither to - morrow at five o'clock , if you would like to see how that population has grown of late years . "
33452	33476	33267	33267	Esther	214	" Oh , I 've been to Sproxton already several times . I had a congregation of my own there last Sunday evening . "
33477	33484	33486	33487	Mr. Lyon	208	" What ! do you preach ? "
33493	33505	33267	33267	Esther	214	" Not exactly . I went to the ale - house . "
33510	33553	33506	33507	Mr. Lyon	208	" I trust you are putting a riddle to me , young man , even as Samson did to his companions . From what you said but lately , it can not be that you are given to tippling and to taverns . "
33554	33646	33506	33507	Mr. Lyon	208	" Oh , I do n't drink much . I order a pint of beer , and I get into talk with the fellows over their pots and pipes . Somebody must take a little knowledge and common - sense to them in this way , else how are they to get it ? I go for educating the non - electors , so I put myself in the way of my pupils my academy is the beer - house . I 'll walk with you to - morrow with pleasure . "
33647	33654	33656	33657	Mr. Lyon	208	" Do so , do so , "
33666	33683	33662	33664	his odd acquaintance	1537	" We shall understand each other better by - and - by , I doubt not . "
33684	33695	33506	33507	Mr. Lyon	208	" I wish you good - evening , Miss Lyon . "
33704	33714	33716	33717	the minister	1433	" That is a singular young man , Esther , "
33726	33878	33716	33717	the minister	1433	" I discern in him a love for whatsoever things are honest and true , which I would fain believe to be an earnest of further endowment with the wisdom that is from on high . It is true that , as the traveller in the desert is often lured , by a false vision of water and freshness , to turn aside from the track which leads to the tried and established fountains , so the Evil One will take advantage of a natural yearning toward the better , to delude the soul with a self - flattering belief in a visionary virtue , higher than the ordinary fruits of the Spirit . But I trust it is not so here . I feel a great enlargement in this young man 's presence , notwithstanding a certain license in his language , which I shall use my efforts to correct . "
33879	33889	33891	33891	Esther	214	" I think he is very coarse and rude , "
33902	33920	33891	33891	Esther	214	" But he speaks better English than most of 68 our visitors . What is his occupation ? "
33921	33971	33899	33899	her	214	" Watch and clock making , by which , together with a little teaching , as I understand , he hopes to maintain his mother , not thinking it right that he should live by the sale of medicines whose virtues he distrusts . It is no common scruple . "
33972	33976	33978	33978	Esther	214	" Dear me , "
33980	33990	33991	33991	She	214	" I thought he was something higher than that . "
34014	34268	34002	34002	he	1539	" Now by what fine meshes of circumstance did that queer devout old man , with his awful creed , which makes this world a vestibule with double doors to hell , and a narrow stair on one side whereby the thinner sort may mount to heaven by what subtle play of flesh and spirit did he come to have a daughter so little in his own likeness ? Married foolishly , I suppose . I 'll never marry , though I should have to live on raw turnips to subdue my flesh . I 'll never look back and say , ' I had a fine purpose once I meant to keep my hands clean and my soul upright , and to look truth in the face ; but pray excuse me , I have a wife and children I must lie and simper a little , else they 'll starve ' ; or ' My wife is nice , she must have her bread well buttered , and her feelings will be hurt if she is not thought genteel . ' That is the lot Miss Esther is preparing for some man or other . I could grind my teeth at such self - satisfied minxes , who think they can tell everybody what is the correct thing , and the utmost stretch of their ideas will not place them on a level with the intelligent fleas . I should like to see if she could be made ashamed of herself . "

40316	40339	40306	40306	Annette	258	" Because I never loved any woman till now . I thought I should never marry . Now I wish to marry . "

And when you are well enough to get up , we will go out and be 82 married shall we not ? See ! and la petite "

J'aimais les fleurs , les bals , la musique , et mon mari qui ťtait beau . But all that is gone away . There is nothing of my religion in this country .

42081	42091	42092	42093	Lady Debarry	151	" We shall find her greatly elated , doubtless , "
42097	42107	42092	42093	Lady Debarry	151	" She has been in the shade so long . "
42108	42114	42116	42117	Sir Maximus	152	" Ah , poor thing ! "
42119	42167	42116	42117	Sir Maximus	152	" A fine woman she was in her bloom . I remember the first county ball she attended we were all ready to fight for the sake of dancing with her . I always liked her from that time I never swallowed the scandal about her myself . "
42168	42178	42180	42181	Lady Debarry	151	" If we are to be intimate with her , "
42183	42207	42180	42181	Lady Debarry	151	" I wish you would avoid making such allusions , Sir Maximus . I should not like Selina and Harriet to hear them . "
42208	42229	42231	42232	the baronet	1833	" My dear , I should have forgotten all about the scandal , only you remind me of it sometimes , "
42243	42257	42259	42260	Lady Debarry	151	" These sudden turns of fortune are often dangerous to an excitable constitution , "
42271	42356	42259	42260	Lady Debarry	151	" Poor Lady Alicia Methurst got heart - disease from a sudden piece of luck the death of her uncle , you know . If Mrs. Transome was wise she would go to town she can afford it now , and consult Dr. Truncheon . I should say myself he would order her digitalis : I have often guessed exactly what a prescription would be . But it certainly was one of her weak points to think she understood medicine better than other people . "
42357	42383	42424	42425	Sir Maximus	152	" She 's a healthy woman enough , surely : see how upright she is , and she rides about like a girl of twenty . "
42384	42395	42259	42260	Lady Debarry	151	" She is so thin that she makes me shudder . "
42396	42414	42424	42425	Sir Maximus	152	" Pooh ! she 's slim and active ; women are not bid for by the pound . "
42415	42423	42259	42260	Lady Debarry	151	" Pray do n't be so coarse . "
42556	42570	42572	42573	Sir Maximus	152	" Well , our lucky youngster is come in the nick of time , "
42575	42596	42572	42573	Sir Maximus	152	" if he 'll stand , he and Philip can run in harness together and keep out both the Whigs . "
42597	42610	42612	42613	Lady Debarry	151	" It is really quite a providential thing his returning just now , "
42615	42640	42612	42613	Lady Debarry	151	" I could n't help thinking that something would occur to prevent Philip from having such a man as Peter Garstin for his colleague . "
42641	42650	42652	42653	Sir Maximus	152	" I call my friend Harold a youngster , "
42655	42674	42652	42653	Sir Maximus	152	" for , you know , I remember him only as he was when that portrait was taken . "
42675	42683	42685	42686	Mrs. Transome	269	" That is a long while ago , "
42688	42700	42685	42686	Mrs. Transome	269	" My son is much altered , as you may imagine . "
42740	42834	42727	42727	her	269	" Yes , yes , on the outside , I dare say . But he was a fine fellow I always liked him . And if anybody should ask me what I should choose for the good of the country , I could n't have thought of anything better than having a young Transome for a neighbor who will take an active part . The Transomes and the Debarrys were always on the right side together in old days . Of course he 'll stand he has made up his mind to it ? "
43007	43038	42997	42997	he	144	" Dear me , what a splendid little boy , Mrs. Transome ! why it can not be can it be that you have the happiness to be a grandmamma ? "
43039	43050	42997	42997	he	144	" Yes ; that is my son 's little boy . "
43051	43054	43056	43057	Lady Debarry	151	" Indeed ! "
43062	43086	43056	43057	Lady Debarry	151	" I never heard you speak of his marriage . He has brought you home a daughter - in - law , then ? "
43088	43091	43093	43094	Mrs. Transome	269	" No , "
43103	43103	43093	43094	Mrs. Transome	269	"
43104	43109	43111	43112	Lady Debarry	151	" O o oh ! "
43128	43164	43111	43112	Lady Debarry	151	" How very singular I mean that we should not have heard of Mr. Harold 's marriage . But he 's a charming little fellow : come to me , you round - cheeked cherub . "
43212	43219	43225	43225	they	1851	" Nau - o - oom , "
43239	43244	43225	43225	they	1851	" naughty old woman , "
43279	43295	43297	43298	Mrs. Transome	269	" Go , go , Harry ; let poor Puff alone he 'll bite you , "
43382	43389	43391	43392	Lady Debarry	151	" I fear you are hurt , "
43398	43422	43391	43392	Lady Debarry	151	" What a little savage ! Do have your arm attended to , my dear I recommend fomentation do n't think of me . "
43423	43433	43435	43436	Mrs. Transome	269	" Oh , thank you , it is nothing , "
43445	43488	43435	43436	Mrs. Transome	269	" it will soon go off . The pleasures of being a grandmamma , you perceive . The child has taken a dislike to me ; but he makes quite a new life for Mr. Transome ; they were playfellows at once . "
43489	43494	43496	43497	Sir Maximus	152	" Bless my heart ! "
43499	43557	43496	43497	Sir Maximus	152	" it is odd to think of Harold having been a family man so long . I made up my mind he was a young bachelor . What an old stager I am , to be sure ! And whom has he married ? I hope we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Harold Transome . "
43577	43584	43585	43586	Lady Debarry	151	" She is no longer living , "
43590	43665	43585	43586	Lady Debarry	151	" but now , my dear Sir Maximus , we must not hinder Mrs. Transome from attending to her arm . I am sure she is in pain . Do n't say another word , my dear we shall see you again you and Mr. Harold will come and dine with us on 87 Thursday say yes , only yes . Sir Maximus is longing to see him : and Philip will be down . "
43666	43671	43673	43674	Sir Maximus	152	" Yes , yes ! "
43676	43722	43673	43674	Sir Maximus	152	" he must lose no time in making Philip 's acquaintance . Tell him Philip is a fine fellow carried everything before him at Oxford . And your son must be returned along with him for North Loamshire . You said he meant to stand ? "
43723	43747	43749	43750	Mrs. Transome	269	" I will write and let you know if Harold has any engagement for Thursday ; he would of course be happy otherwise , "
43756	43771	43673	43674	Sir Maximus	152	" If not Thursday , the next day the very first day he can . "
43799	43811	43812	43812	she	269	" This is the last visit I shall receive from them , "
43829	43840	43842	43843	Lady Debarry	151	" That poor creature is not happy , Sir Maximus , "
43849	43933	43842	43843	Lady Debarry	151	" Something annoys her about her son . I hope there is nothing unpleasant in his character . Either he kept his marriage a secret from her , or she was ashamed of it . He is thirty - four at least by this time . After living in the East so long he may have become a sort of person one would not care to be intimate with , and that savage boy he does n't look like a lady 's child . "
43934	43940	43942	43943	Sir Maximus	152	" Pooh , my dear , "
43945	44165	43942	43943	Sir Maximus	152	" women think so much of those minutia . In the present state of the country it is our duty to look at a man 's position and politics . Philip and my brother are both of that opinion , and I think they know what 's right , if any man does . We are bound to regard every man of our party as a public instrument , and to pull all together . The Transomes have always been a good Tory family , but it has been a cipher of late years . This young fellow coming back with a fortune to give the family a head and a position is a clear gain to the county ; and with Philip he 'll get into the right hands of course he wants guiding , having been out of the country so long . All we have to ask is , whether a man 's a Tory , and will make a stand for the good of the country ? that 's the plain English of the matter . And I do beg of you , my dear , to set aside all these gossiping niceties , and exert yourself , like a woman of sense and spirit as you are , to bring the right people together . "
44306	44314	44315	44316	Lady Debarry	151	" I am sure , Sir Maximus , "
44319	44336	44315	44316	Lady Debarry	151	" you could not have observed that anything was wanting in my manners to Mrs. Transome . "
44337	44444	44315	44316	Lady Debarry	151	" No , no , my dear ; but I say this by way of caution . Never mind what was done at Smyrna , or whether Transome likes to sit with his heels tucked up . We may surely wink at a few things for the sake of the public interest , if God Almighty does ; and if He did n't , I do n't know what would have become of the country Government could never have been carried on , and many a good battle would have been lost . That 's the philosophy of the matter , and common - sense too . "
44524	44531	44533	44534	this personage	1866	" Excuse me , Sir Maximus , "
44544	44569	44533	44534	this personage	1866	" but I have just learned something of importance at Treby , which I thought you would like to know as soon as possible . "
44570	44583	44585	44586	Sir Maximus	152	" Ah ! what 's that ? Something about Garstin or Clement ? "
44598	44633	44589	44590	the other	1867	" No ; rather worse , I fear you will think . A new Radical candidate . I got this by a stratagem from the printer 's boy . They 're not posted yet . "
44634	44638	44651	44651	he	152	" A Radical ! "
44657	44669	44651	44651	he	152	" What fool is he ? he 'll have no chance . "
44670	44679	44589	44590	the other	1867	" They say he 's richer than Garstin . "
44680	44684	44690	44690	he	152	" Harold Transome ! "
44700	44756	44690	44690	he	152	" I do n't believe it it 's a trick it 's a squib : why why we 've just been to his place eh ? do 89 you know any more ? Speak , sir speak ; do n't deal out your story like a damned mountebank , who wants to keep people gaping . "
44757	44768	44770	44771	Lady Debarry	151	" Sir Maximus , pray do n't give way so , "
44773	44786	44788	44788	Christian	271	" I 'm afraid there 's no doubt about it , sir , "
44790	44857	44788	44788	Christian	271	" After getting the bill , I met Mr. Labron 's clerk , and he said he had just had the whole story from Jermyn 's clerk . The Ram Inn is engaged already , and a committee is being made up . He says Jermyn goes like a steam engine , when he has a mind , although he makes such long - winded speeches . "
44858	44901	44690	44690	he	152	" Jermyn be hanged for a two - faced rascal ! Tell Mitchell to drive on . It 's of no use to stay chattering here . Jump up on the box and go home with us . I may want you . "
44902	44912	44914	44915	the baronet	1833	" You see I was right , Sir Maximus , "
44919	44933	44914	44915	the baronet	1833	" I had an instinct that we should find him an unpleasant person . "
44934	44960	44690	44690	he	152	" Fudge ! if you had such a fine instinct , why did you let us go to Transome Court and make fools of ourselves ? "
44961	44982	44914	44915	the baronet	1833	" Would you have listened to me ? But of course you will not have him to dine with you ? "
44983	45070	44690	44690	he	152	" Dine with me ? I should think not . I 'd sooner he should dine off me . I see how it is clearly enough . He has become a regular beast among those Mahometans he 's got neither religion nor morals left . He ca n't know any thing about English politics . He 'll go and cut his own nose off as a landholder , and never know . However , he wo n't get in he 'll spend his money for nothing . "
45071	45081	45083	45084	Lady Debarry	151	" I fear he is a very licentious man , "
45086	45108	45083	45084	Lady Debarry	151	" We know now why his mother seemed so uneasy . I should think she reflects a little , poor creature . "
45109	45178	45083	45084	Lady Debarry	151	" It 's a confounded nuisance we did n't meet Christian on our way , instead of coming back ; but better now than later . He 's an uncommonly adroit , useful fellow , that factotum of Philip 's . I wish Phil would take my man and give me Christian . I 'd make him house - steward : he might reduce the accounts a little . "
45496	45503	45471	45472	every one	5834	" good - evening , gentlemen , "
45669	45673	45708	45709	the steward	5653	" Eugene Aram , "
45903	45906	45908	45909	Mr. Crowder	279	" Why , "
45942	45961	45962	45962	he	279	" why , I suppose they get money so fast in the East it 's wonderful . Why , "
45974	45986	45962	45962	he	279	" this Transome p'r'aps got a matter of a hundred thousand . "
45987	46006	46008	46009	Mr. Scales	277	" A hundred thousand , my dear sir ! fiddle - stick 's end of a hundred thousand , "
46024	46027	46029	46030	Mr. Crowder	279	" Well , "
46049	46057	46038	46042	the all - knowing butler	1922	" perhaps not so much as that . "
46058	46077	46008	46009	Mr. Scales	277	" Not so much , sir ! I tell you that a hundred thousand pounds is a bagatelle . "
46078	46089	46091	46092	Mr. Crowder	279	" Well , I know it 's a big sum , "
46116	46127	46129	46130	Mr. Christian	271	" Bagatelle is the French for trifle , my friend , "
46132	46155	46129	46130	Mr. Christian	271	" Do n't talk over people 's heads so , Scales . I shall have hard work to understand you myself soon . "
46156	46165	46167	46170	the head - gardener	1924	" Come , that 's a good one , "
46178	46193	46174	46176	a ready admirer	1925	" I should like to hear the thing you do n't understand , Christian . "
46194	46205	46207	46208	Mr. Scales	277	" He 's a first - rate hand at sneering , "
46213	46247	46249	46250	Mr. Christian	271	" Do n't be waspie , man . I 'll ring the bell for lemons , and make some punch . That 's the thing for putting people up to the unknown tongues , "
46264	46275	46260	46260	he	271	" What I mean , Mr. Crowder , is this . "
46312	46327	46329	46331	the reasonable Crowder	279	" Come , then , speak English ; I 'm not against being taught , "
46333	46376	46260	46260	he	271	" What I mean is , that in a large way of trade a man turns his capital over almost as soon as he can turn himself . Bless your soul ! I know something about these matters , eh , Brent ? "
46377	46387	46389	46390	the gardener	1927	" To be sure you do few men more , "
46399	46503	46260	46260	he	271	" Not that I 've had anything to do with commercial families myself . I 've those feelings that I look to other things besides lucre . But I ca n't say that I 've not been intimate with parties who have been less nice than I am myself ; and knowing what I know , I should n't wonder if Transome had as much as five hundred thousand . Bless your soul , sir ! people who get their money out of land are as long scraping five pounds together as your trading men are in turning five pounds into a hundred . "
46504	46513	46515	46516	Mr. Crowder	279	" That 's a wicked thing , though , "
46520	46523	46524	46524	he	279	" However , "
46534	46571	46524	46524	he	279	" trade or no trade , the Transomes have been poor enough this many a long year . I 've a brother a tenant on their estate I ought to know a little bit about that . "
46572	46582	46584	46585	Mr. Scales	277	" They 've kept up no establishment at all , "
46590	46638	46584	46585	Mr. Scales	277	" They 've even let their kitchen gardens . I suppose it was the son 's gambling . I 've seen something of that . A man who has always lived in first - rate families is likely to know a thing or two on that subject . "
46639	46652	46654	46655	Mr. Crowder	279	" Ah , but it was n't gambling did the first mischief , "
46673	46731	46654	46655	Mr. Crowder	279	" New - comers do n't know what happened in this country twenty and thirty years ago . I 'm turned fifty myself , and my father lived under Sir Maximus 's father . But if anybody from London can tell me more than I know about this country - side , I 'm willing to listen . "
46732	46745	46747	46748	Mr. Scales	277	" What was it , then , if it was n't gambling ? "
46754	46762	46747	46748	Mr. Scales	277	" I do n't pretend to know . "
46763	46782	46584	46585	Mr. Scales	277	" It was law law that 's what it was . Not but what the Transomes always won . "
46783	46788	46790	46794	the too - ready Scales	1929	" And always lost , "
46796	46811	46790	46794	the too - ready Scales	1929	" Yes , yes ; I think we all know the nature of law . "
46812	46829	46831	46832	Mr. Crowder	279	" There was the last suit of all made the most noise , as I understood , "
46834	46930	46831	46832	Mr. Crowder	279	" but it was n't tried hereabout . They said there was a deal o ' false swearing . Some young man pretended to be the true 93 heir let me see I ca n't justly remember the names he 'd got two . He swore he was one man , and they swore he was another . However Lawyer Jermyn won it they say he 'd win a game against the Old One himself and the young fellow turned out to be a scamp . Stop a bit his name was Scaddon Henry Scaddon . "
46961	46970	46971	46971	he	271	" Hallo ! What a bungler I am ! "
46988	47003	46971	46971	he	271	" Go on with your tale , Mr. Crowder a scamp named Henry Scaddon . "
47004	47012	47014	47015	Mr. Crowder	279	" Well , that 's the tale , "
47017	47126	47014	47015	Mr. Crowder	279	" He was never seen nothing of anymore . It was a deal talked of at the time and I 've sat by ; and my father used to shake his head ; and always when this Mrs. Transome was talked of , he used to shake his head , and say she carried things with a high hand once . But , Lord ! it was before the battle of Waterloo , and I 'm a poor hand at tales ; I do n't see much good in 'em myself but if anybody'll tell me a cure for the sheep - rot , I 'll thank him . "
47158	47176	47178	47179	Mr. Scales	277	" Well , well , bygones should be bygones ; there are secrets in most good families , "
47183	47260	47178	47179	Mr. Scales	277	" and this young Transome , coming back with a fortune to keep up the establishment , and have things done in a decent and gentlemanly way it would all have been right if he 'd not been this sort of Radical madman . But now he 's done for himself . I heard Sir Maximus say at dinner that he would be excommunicated ; and that 's a pretty strong word , I take it . "
47261	47269	47271	47272	Mr. Christian	271	" What does it mean , Scales ? "
47278	47286	47288	47289	Mr. Crowder	279	" Ay , what 's the meaning ? "
47302	47325	47178	47179	Mr. Scales	277	" Well , it 's a law term speaking in a figurative sort of way meaning that a Radical was no gentleman . "
47326	47346	47348	47349	Mr. Crowder	279	" Perhaps it 's partly accounted for by his getting his money so fast , and in foreign countries , "
47353	47372	47348	47349	Mr. Crowder	279	" It 's reasonable to think he 'd be against the land and this country eh , Sircome ? "
47446	47487	47438	47438	He	284	" I say nothing . Before I bring words to market , I should like to see 'em a bit scarcer . There 's the land and there 's trade I hold with both . I swim with the stream . "
47488	47502	47504	47505	Mr. Christian	271	" Hey - day , Mr. Sircome ! that 's a Radical maxim , "
47520	47539	47516	47516	his	271	" I advise you to give it up , else it will injure the quality of your flour . "
47540	47545	47547	47548	Mr. Sircome	284	" A Radical maxim ! "
47557	47577	47547	47548	Mr. Sircome	284	" I should like to hear you prove that . It 's as old as my grandfather , anyhow . "
47578	47587	47589	47591	the glib Christian	271	" I 'll prove it in one minute , "
47593	47687	47589	47591	the glib Christian	271	" Reform has set in by the will of the majority that 's the rabble , you know ; and the respectability and good sense of the country , which are in the minority , are afraid of Reform running on too fast . So the stream must be running toward Reform and Radicalism ; and if you swim with it , Mr. Sircome , you 're a Reformer and a Radical , and your flour is objectionable , and not full weight and being tried by Scales , will be found wanting . "
47745	47756	47758	47759	the gardener	1927	" What a fellow you are for fence , Christian , "
47761	47776	47758	47759	the gardener	1927	" Hang me , if I do n't think you 're up to everything . "
47777	47794	47796	47797	Mr. Sircome	284	" That 's a compliment you might pay Old Nick , if you come to that , "
47813	47818	47820	47821	Mr. Scales	277	" Yes , yes , "
47823	47867	47820	47821	Mr. Scales	277	" I 'm no fool myself , and could parry a thrust if I liked , but I should n't like it to be said of me that I was up to everything . I 'll keep a little principle if you please . "
47868	47873	47875	47875	Christian	271	" To be sure , "
47882	47890	47875	47875	Christian	271	" What would justice be without Scales ? "
47912	47921	47923	47924	the butler	5690	" A joke 's a joke among gentlemen , "
47929	47970	47923	47924	the butler	5690	" I think there has been quite liberties enough taken with my name . But if you must talk about names , I 've heard of a party before now calling himself a Christian , and being anything but it . "
47971	47980	47982	47983	the surgeon	1945	" Come , that 's beyond a joke , "
48000	48007	47982	47983	the surgeon	1945	" Let it drop , Scales . "
48008	48086	47923	47924	the butler	5690	" Yes , I dare say it 's beyond a joke . I 'm not a harlequin to talk nothing but jokes . I leave that to other Christians , who are up to everything , and have been everywhere to the hulks , for what I know ; and more than that , they come from nobody knows where , and try to worm themselves into gentlemen 's confidence , to the prejudice of their betters . "
48221	48306	48215	48215	he	1955	" I do n't intend to quarrel with you , Scales . Such talk as this is not profitable to either of us . It makes you purple in the face you are apoplectic , you know and it spoils good company . Better tell a few fibs about me behind my back it will heat you less , and do me more harm . I 'll leave you to it ; I shall go and have a game of whist with the ladies . "
48334	48344	48346	48347	Mr. Crowder	279	" That 's an uncommon sort o ' fellow , "
48361	48377	48346	48347	Mr. Crowder	279	" Why , Mr. Philip picked him up in foreign parts , did n't he ? "
48378	48384	48386	48387	the gardener	1927	" He was a courier , "
48389	48435	48386	48387	the gardener	1927	" He 's had a deal of experience . And I believe , by what I can make out for he 's been pretty free with me sometimes there was a time when he was in that rank of life that he fought a duel . "
48436	48447	48449	48450	Mr. Crowder	279	" Ah ! that makes him such a cool chap , "
48452	48462	48464	48465	Mr. Sircome	284	" He 's what I call an overbearing fellow , "
48485	48516	48476	48477	Mr. Filmore	285	" He runs you down with a sort of talk that 's neither here nor there . He 's got a deal too many samples in his pocket for me . "
48517	48531	48533	48534	Mr. Filmore	285	" All I know is , he 's a wonderful hand at cards , "
48548	48586	48533	48534	Mr. Filmore	285	" I wish I could play ťcartť as he does ; it 's beautiful to see him ; he can make a man look pretty blue ; he 'll empty his pocket for him in no time . "
48587	48595	48597	48598	Mr. Sircome	284	" That 's none to his credit , "
48666	48676	48677	48677	Shakespeare	287	" Rumor doth double like the voice and echo . "
49032	49034	48983	48984	Miss Rumor	286	" folks "
49470	49481	49469	49469	he	288	" did n't know which - a - way to turn "
49706	49780	49694	49694	Harold	269	" Oh , Jermyn be hanged ! It seems to me if Durfey had n't died and made room for me , Jermyn would have ended by coming to live here , and you would have had to keep the lodge and open the gate for his carriage . But I shall pay him off mortgages and all by - and - by . I 'll owe him nothing not even a curse ! "
49955	49986	49947	49947	Harold	269	" that with the estate so burdened , the yearly loss by arrears could better be borne than the outlay and sacrifice necessary in order to let the farms anew . "
49987	49997	49998	49998	she	269	" I was really capable of calculating , Harold , "
50007	50087	49998	49998	she	269	" It seems easy to deal with farmers and their affairs when you only see them in print , I dare say ; but it 's not quite so easy when you live among them . You have only to look at Sir Maximus 's estate : you will see plenty of the same thing . The times have been dreadful 99 and old families like to keep their old tenants . But I dare say that is Toryism . "
50088	50149	50150	50150	Harold	269	" It 's a hash of odds and ends , if that is Toryism , my dear mother . However , I wish you had kept three more old tenants ; for then I should have had three more fifty - pound voters . And , in a hard run , one may be beaten by a head . But , "
50165	50232	50150	50150	Harold	269	" a woman ought to be a Tory , and graceful , and handsome , like you . I should hate a woman who took up my opinions and talked for me . I 'm an Oriental , you know . I say , mother , shall we have this room furnished with rose - color ? I notice that it suits your bright gray hair . "
51061	51084	51049	51049	he	2047	" I 'll get rich somehow , and have an estate of my own , and do what I like with it . "
52449	52457	52458	52459	King John	291	" A woman naturally born to fears . "
52461	52487	52458	52459	King John	291	" Methinks , Some unborn sorrow , ripe in fortune 's womb , Is coming toward me ; and my inward soul With nothing trembles . "
52511	52520	52504	52504	She	269	" You knew Harold was not at home ? "
52521	52557	52504	52504	She	269	" Yes ; I came to see you , to know if you had any wishes that I could further , since I have not had an opportunity of consulting you since he came home . "
52559	52569	52504	52504	She	269	" Let us walk toward the Rookery , then . "
52761	52769	52770	52770	he	173	" Harold is remarkably acute and clever , "
52782	52809	52776	52777	Mrs. Transome	269	" If he gets into Parliament , I have no doubt he will distinguish himself . He has a quick eye for business of all kinds . "
52810	52818	52820	52821	Mrs. Transome	269	" That is no comfort to me , "
52920	52956	53014	53015	Mrs. Transome	269	" I trust he is not unkind to you in any way . I know his opinions pain you ; but I trust you find him in everything else disposed to be a good son . "
52957	53008	53014	53015	Mrs. Transome	269	" Oh , to be sure good as men are disposed to be to women , giving them cushions and carriages , and recommending them to enjoy themselves , and then expecting them to be contented under contempt and neglect . I have no power over him remember that none . "
53041	53054	53060	53061	Mrs. Transome	269	" Has he shown any unpleasant feeling about your management of affairs ? "
53055	53059	53060	53061	Mrs. Transome	269	" My management ! "
53236	53242	53243	53243	he	173	" My dear Mrs. Transome , "
53253	53326	53243	53243	he	173	" you are agitated you appear angry with me . Yet I think , if you consider , you will see that you have nothing to complain of in me , unless you will complain of the inevitable course of man 's life . I have always met your wishes both in happy circumstances and in unhappy ones . I should be ready to do so now , if it were possible . "
53613	53620	53591	53591	he	173	" You have brought it on me "
53632	53639	53591	53591	he	173	" You brought it on yourself . "
53679	53686	53677	53677	she	269	" Let me take your arm . "
53714	53728	53704	53705	Mrs. Transome	269	" I have but one thing to ask . Make me a promise . "
53729	53734	53677	53677	she	269	" What is it ? "
53735	53744	53704	53705	Mrs. Transome	269	" That you will never quarrel with Harold . "
53745	53760	53677	53677	she	269	" You must know that it is my wish not to quarrel with him . "
53761	53789	53704	53705	Mrs. Transome	269	" But make a vow fix it in your mind as a thing not to be done . Bear anything from him rather than quarrel with him . "
53790	53802	53804	53804	Jermyn	173	" A man ca n't make a vow not to quarrel , "
53825	53848	53804	53804	Jermyn	173	" A man 's temper may get the better of him at any moment . I am not prepared to bear anything . "
53849	53853	53855	53856	Mrs. Transome	269	" Good God ! "
53865	53879	53859	53859	her	269	" is it possible you do n't feel how horrible it would be ? "

55843	55895	55838	55839	the minister	1433	" Dear me , it is you , Mr. Holt ! I fear you will have to wait some time before you can see my father . The sermon is not ended yet , and there will be the hymn and the prayer , and perhaps other things to detain him . "
55896	55918	56035	56035	his	2190	" Well , will you let me sit down in the kitchen ? I do n't want to be a bore . "
55919	55924	55926	55926	Esther	214	" Oh , no , "
55934	55982	55926	55926	Esther	214	" I always give you credit for not meaning it . Pray come in , if you do n't mind waiting . I was sitting in the kitchen : the kettle is singing quite prettily . It is much nicer than the parlor not half so ugly . "
55983	55990	56035	56035	his	2190	" There I agree with you . "
55991	56019	55926	55926	Esther	214	" How very extraordinary ! But if you prefer the kitchen , and do n't want to sit with me , I can go into the parlor . "
56020	56030	56032	56032	Felix	134	" I came on purpose to sit with you , "
56039	56088	56035	56035	his	2190	" but I thought it likely you might be vexed at seeing me . I wanted to talk to you , but I 've got nothing pleasant to say . As your father would have it , I 'm not given to prophesy smooth things to prophesy deceit . "
56089	56093	56095	56095	Esther	214	" I understand , "
56100	56121	56095	56095	Esther	214	" Pray be seated . You thought I had no afternoon sermon , so you came to give me one . "
56123	56126	56128	56128	Felix	134	" Yes , "
56159	56201	56151	56151	his	2190	" and my text is something you said the other day . You said you did n't mind about people having right opinions so that they had good taste . Now I want you to see what shallow stuff that is . "
56202	56225	56131	56131	himself	134	" Oh , I do n't doubt it if you say so . I know you are a person of right opinions . "
56226	56258	56151	56151	his	2190	" But by opinions you mean men 's thoughts about great subjects , and by taste you mean their thoughts about small ones : dress , behavior , amusements , ornaments . "
56259	56271	56131	56131	himself	134	" Well yes or rather , their sensibilities about those things . "
56272	56375	56151	56151	his	2190	" It comes to the same thing ; thoughts , opinions , knowledge , are only a sensibility to facts and ideas . If I understand a geometrical problem , it is because I have a sensibility to the way in which lines and figures are related to each other ; and I want you to see that the creature who has the sensibilities that you call taste , and not the sensibilities that you call opinions , is simply a lower , pettier sort of thing an insect that notices the shaking of the table , but never notices the thunder . "
56376	56395	56131	56131	himself	134	" Very well , I am an insect ; yet I notice that you are thundering at me . "
56396	56447	56151	56151	his	2190	" No , you are not an insect . That is what exasperates me at your making a boast of littleness . You have enough understanding to make it wicked that you should add one more to the women who hinder men 's lives from having any nobleness in them . "
56470	56477	56478	56478	she	214	" What is my horrible guilt ? "
56550	56565	56566	56566	he	2191	" Why do you read this mawkish stuff on a Sunday , for example ? "
56571	56574	56577	56577	his	2191	" Rťnť , "
56583	56610	56577	56577	his	2191	" Why do n't you always go to chapel , Mr. Holt , and read Howe 's ' Living Temple , ' and join the church ? "
56612	56660	56577	56577	his	2191	" There 's just the difference between us I know why I do n't do those things . I distinctly see that I can do something better . I have other principles , and should sink myself by doing what I do n't recognize as the best . "
56661	56665	56667	56667	Esther	214	" I understand , "
56680	56697	56667	56667	Esther	214	" I am a lower kind of being , and could not so easily sink myself . "
56698	56795	56577	56577	his	2191	" Not by entering into your father 's ideas . If a woman really believes herself to be a lower kind of being , she should place herself in subjection : she should be ruled by the thoughts of her father or husband . If not , let her show her power of choosing something better . You must know that your father 's principles are greater and worthier than what guides your life . You have no reason but idle fancy and selfish inclination for shirking his teaching and giving your soul up to trifles . "
56796	56820	56667	56667	Esther	214	" You are kind enough to say so . But I am not aware that I have ever confided my reasons to you . "
56821	56981	56577	56577	his	2191	" Why , what worth calling a reason could make any mortal hang over this trash ? idiotic immorality dressed up to look fine , with a little bit of doctrine tacked to it , like a hare 's foot on a dish , to make believe the mess is not cat 's flesh . Look here ! ' Est - ce ma faute , si je trouve partout les bornes , si ce qui est fini n'a pour moi aucune valeur ? ' Yes , sir , distinctly your fault , because you 're an ass . Your dunce who ca n't do his sums always has a taste for the infinite . Sir , do you know what a rhomboid is ? Oh , no , I do n't value these things with limits . ' Cependant , j'aime la monotonie des sentimens de la vie , et si j'avais encore la folie de croire au bonheur ' "
56982	57008	56667	56667	Esther	214	" Oh , pray , Mr. Holt , do n't go on reading with that dreadful accent ; it sets one 's teeth on edge . "
57026	57031	57033	57033	Felix	134	" There it is ! "
57049	57083	57033	57033	Felix	134	" You are only happy when you can spy a tag or a tassel loose to turn the talk , and get rid of any judgment that must carry grave action after it . "
57084	57099	56577	56577	his	2191	" I think I have borne a great deal of talk without turning it . "
57100	57153	57033	57033	Felix	134	" Not enough , Miss Lyon not all that I came to say . I want you to change . Of course I am a brute to say so . I ought to say you are perfect . Another man would , perhaps . But I say I want you to change . "
57155	57168	57033	57033	Felix	134	" How am I to oblige you ? By joining the Church ? "
57169	57279	57280	57280	Esther	214	" No ; but by asking yourself whether life is not as solemn a thing as your father takes it to be in which you may be either a blessing or a curse to many . You know you have never done that . You do n't care to be better than a bird trimming its feathers , and pecking about after what pleases it . You are discontented with the world because you ca n't get just the small things that suit your pleasure , not because it 's a world where myriads of men and women are ground by wrong and misery , and tainted with pollution . "
57397	57423	57392	57392	her	214	" Pray go on , Mr. Holt . Relieve yourself of these burning truths . I am sure they must be troublesome to carry unuttered . "
57424	57430	57432	57432	Felix	134	" Yes , they are , "
57443	57572	57432	57432	Felix	134	" I ca n't bear to see you going the way of the foolish women who spoil men 's lives . Men ca n't help loving them , and so they make themselves slaves to the petty desires of petty creatures . That 's the way those who might do better spend their lives for nought get checked in every great effort toil with brain and limb for things that have no more to do with a manly life than tarts and confectionery . That 's what makes women a curse ; and life is stunted to suit their littleness . That 's why I 'll never love , if I can help it ; and if I love , I 'll bear it , and never marry . "
57664	57682	57645	57645	She	214	" I ought to be very much obliged to you for giving me your confidence so freely . "
57684	57719	57645	57645	She	214	" Ah ! now you are offended with me , and disgusted with me . I expected it would be so . A woman does n't like a man who tells her the truth . "
57720	57738	57740	57740	Esther	214	" I think you boast a little too much of your truth - telling , Mr. Holt , "
57747	57778	57740	57740	Esther	214	" That virtue is apt to be easy to people when they only wound others and not themselves . Telling the truth often means no more than taking a liberty . "
57779	57811	57645	57645	She	214	" Yes , I suppose I should have been taking a liberty if I had tried to drag you back by the skirt when I saw you running into a pit . "
57812	57839	57740	57740	Esther	214	" You should really found a sect . Preaching is your vocation . It is a pity you should ever have an audience of only one . "
57840	57887	57645	57645	She	214	" I see I have made a fool of myself . I thought you had a more generous mind that you might be kindled to a better ambition . But I 've set your vanity aflame nothing else . I 'm going . Good - bye . "
57888	57893	57895	57895	Esther	214	" Good - bye , "

60818	60939	60807	60808	Mr. Chubb	298	" I 've that sort of head that I 've often wished I was stupider . I use things up , sir ; I see into things a deal too quick . I eat my dinner , as you may say , at breakfast - time . That 's why I hardly ever smoke a pipe . No sooner do I stick a pipe in my mouth than I puff and puff till it 's gone before other folks ' are well lit ; and then , where am I ? I might as well have let it alone . In this world it 's better not to be too quick . But you know what it is , sir . "
60940	60944	60946	60946	Felix	134	" Not I , "
60959	60985	60946	60946	Felix	134	" I generally feel myself rather a blockhead . The world 's a largish place , and I have n't turned everything inside out yet . "
60986	61025	60807	60808	Mr. Chubb	298	" Ah , that 's your deepness . I think we understand one another . And about this here election , I lay two to one we should agree if we was to come to talk about it . "
61026	61029	61031	61031	Felix	134	" Ah ! "
61039	61090	60807	60808	Mr. Chubb	298	" You 're none of a Tory , eh , sir ? You wo n't go to vote for Debarry ? That was what I said at the very first go - off . Says I , he 's no Tory . I think I was right , sir eh ? "
61091	61099	60807	60808	Mr. Chubb	298	" Certainly ; I 'm no Tory . "
61100	61225	60807	60808	Mr. Chubb	298	" No , no , you do n't catch me wrong in a hurry . Well , between you and me , I care no more for the Debarrys than I care for Johnny Groats . I live on none o ' their land , and not a pot's - worth did they ever send to the Sugar Loaf . I 'm not frightened at the Debarrys : there 's no man more independent than me . I 'll plump or I 'll split for them as treat me the handsomest and are the most of what I call gentlemen ; that 's my idee . And in the way of hatching for any man , them are fools that do n't employ me . "
61299	61302	61304	61304	Felix	134	" Yes , "
61308	61325	61304	61304	Felix	134	" I should think there are some sorts of work for which you are just fitted . "
61326	61428	61429	61430	Mr. Chubb	298	" Ah , you see that ? Well , we understand one another . You 're no Tory ; no more am I. And if I 'd got four hands to show at a nomination , the Debarrys should n't have one of 'em . My idee is , there 's a deal too much of their scutchins and their moniments in Treby Church . What 's their 121 scutchins mean ? They 're a sign with little liquor behind 'em ; that 's how I take it . There 's nobody can give account of 'em as I ever heard . "

62222	62295	62216	62216	Brindle	303	" Well , I do . There 's folks wo n't believe beyond the end o ' their own pickaxes . You ca n't drive nothing into 'em , not if you split their skulls . I know for certain sure , from a chap in the cartin ' way , as he 's got money and drink too , only for hollering . Eh , master , what do you say ? "

62357	62481	62322	62322	his	2365	" Ah , but it will take some little time . And we must be quiet . The cleverest of you those who are looked up to in the Club must come and meet me at Peggy Button 's cottage next Saturday , at seven o'clock , after dark . And , Brindle , you must bring that little yellow - haired lad of yours . And anybody that 's got a little boy a very little fellow , who wo n't understand what is said may bring 123 him . But you must keep it close , you know . We do n't want fools there . But everybody who hears me may come . I shall be at Peggy Button 's . "

62565	62581	62559	62559	Brindle	303	" I 'd be ashamed to beat a poor crawling thing 'cause she likes preaching . "

62925	62966	62968	62968	he	309	" there 's some satisfaction to me in finding an establishment like this at the Pits . For what would higher wages do for the workingman if he could n't get a good article for his money ? Why , gentlemen "

63072	63086	63088	63089	Mr. Johnson	309	" Yes , yes , you know what it is , my friend , "
63102	63163	63088	63089	Mr. Johnson	309	" But it wo n't last much longer , that 's one good thing . Bad liquor will be swept away with other bad articles . Trade will prosper and what 's trade now without steam ? and what is steam without coal ? And mark you this , gentlemen there 's no man and no government can make coal . "

63213	63387	63391	63391	his	2371	" Nor freestone , as you say ; else , I think , if coal could be made above - ground , honest fellows who are the pith of our population would not have to bend their backs and sweat in a pit six days out of the seven . No , no ; I say , as this country prospers it has more and more need of you , sirs . It can do without a pack of lazy lords and ladies , but it can never do without brave colliers . And the country will prosper . I pledge you my word , sirs , this country will rise to the tiptop of everything , and there is n't a man in it but what shall have his joint in the pot , and his spare money jingling in his pocket , if we only exert ourselves to send the right men to Parliament men who will speak up for the collier , and the stone - cutter , and the navvy "
63395	63444	63391	63391	his	2371	" and will stand no nonsense . This is a crisis , and we must exert ourselves . We 've got Reform , gentlemen , but now the thing is to make Reform work . It 's a crisis I pledge you my word it 's a crisis . "

63624	63634	63609	63609	he	309	" I think you all know the good news . "
63661	63916	63931	63931	his	2380	" The good news I mean is , that a first - rate man , Mr. Transome , of Transome Court , has offered himself to represent you in Parliament , sirs . I say you in particular , for what he has at heart is the welfare of the workingman of the brave fellows that wield the pickaxe , and the saw , and the hammer . He 's rich has more money than Garstin but he does n't want to keep it to himself . What he wants is , to make a good use of it , gentlemen . He 's come back from foreign parts with his pockets full of gold . He could buy up the Debarrys , if they were worth buying , but he 's got something better to do with his money . He means to use it for the good of the workingmen in these parts . I know there are some men who put up for Parliament and talk a little too big . They may say they want to befriend the colliers , for example . But I should like to put a question to them . I should like to ask them , ' What colliers ? ' There are colliers up at Newcastle , and there are colliers down in Wales . Will it do any good to honest Tom , who is hungry in Sproxton , to hear that Jack at Newcastle has his belly full of beef and pudding ? "
63917	63925	63926	63926	Felix	134	" It ought to do him good , "
63946	63987	63931	63931	his	2380	" If he knows it 's a bad thing to be hungry and not have enough to eat , he ought to be glad that another fellow , who is not idle , is not suffering in the same way . "

64068	64163	64012	64012	His	2380	" men of Sproxton liked Felix as one of themselves , only much more knowing as a 126 workingman who had seen many distant parts , but who must be very poor , since he never drank more than a pint or so . They were quite inclined to hear what he had got to say on another occasion , but they were rather irritated by his interruption at the present moment . Mr. Johnson was annoyed , but he spoke with the same glib quietness as before , though with an expression of contempt .
64164	64222	64012	64012	His	2380	" I call it a poor - spirited thing to take up a man 's straight - forward words and twist them . What I meant to say was plain enough that no man can be saved from starving by looking on while others eat . I think that 's common - sense , eh , sirs ? "
64228	64233	64012	64012	His	2380	" Haw , haw . "
64276	64281	64283	64284	Mr. Johnson	309	" Well , then , "
64286	64318	64283	64284	Mr. Johnson	309	" I suppose I may go on . But if there is any one here better able to inform the company than I am , I give way I give way . "
64319	64322	64324	64325	Mr. Chubb	298	" Sir , "
64329	64346	64347	64347	he	298	" no man shall take the words out of your mouth in this house . And , "
64355	64433	64347	64347	he	298	" company that 's got no more orders to give , and wants to turn up rusty to them that has , had better be making room than filling it . Love an ' ' armony 's the word on our Club 's flag , an ' love an ' ' armony 's the meaning of ' The Sugar Loaf , William Chubb . ' Folks of a different mind had better seek another house of call . "
64434	64438	64440	64440	Felix	134	" Very good , "
64451	64456	64440	64440	Felix	134	" I 'm going . "
64491	64499	64487	64488	Mr. Johnson	309	" What is that person 's name ? "
64500	64506	64508	64509	Mr. Chubb	298	" Does anybody know it ? "
64517	64548	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" I 've heard him speak like a downright Reformer , else I should have looked a little sharper after him . But you may see he 's nothing partic'lar . "
64549	64561	64563	64564	Mr. Johnson	309	" It looks rather bad that no one knows his name , "
64566	64755	64563	64564	Mr. Johnson	309	" He 's most likely a Tory in disguise a Tory spy . You must be careful , sirs , of men who come to you and say they 're Radicals , and yet do nothing for you . They 'll stuff you with words no lack of words but words are wind . Now , a man like Transome comes forward and says to the workingmen of this country : ' Here I am , ready to serve you and speak 127 for you in Parliament , and to get the laws made all right for you ; and in the meanwhile , if there 's any of you who are my neighbors who want a day 's holiday , or a cup to drink with friends , or a copy of the King 's likeness why , I 'm your man . I 'm not a paper handbill all words and no substance nor a man with land and nothing else ; I 've got bags of gold as well as land . ' I think you know what I mean by the King 's likeness . "
64776	64843	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" Well , sirs , there are some men who like to keep this pretty picture a great deal too much to themselves . I do n't know whether I 'm right , but I think I 've heard of such a one not a hundred miles from here . I think his name was Spratt , and he managed some company 's coal - pits . "
64844	64855	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" Haw , haw ! Spratt Spratt 's his name , "
64868	64912	64921	64922	Mr. Chubb	298	" A screwing fellow , by what I understand a domineering fellow who would expect men to do as he liked without paying them for it . I think there 's not an honest man would n't like to disappoint such an upstart . "
64924	64933	64921	64922	Mr. Chubb	298	" I 'll answer for 'em , sir . "
64934	65303	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" Now , listen to me . Here 's Garstin : he 's one of the company you work under . What 's Garstin to you ? who sees him ? and when they do see him they see a thin miserly fellow who keeps his pockets buttoned . He calls himself a Whig , yet he 'll split votes with a Tory he 'll drive with the Debarrys . Now , gentlemen , if I said I 'd got a vote , and anybody asked me what I should do with it , I should say , ' I 'll plump for Transome . ' You 've got no votes , and that 's a shame . But you will have some day , if such men as Transome are returned ; and then you 'll be on a level with the first gentleman in the land , and if he wants to sit in Parliament , he must take off his hat and ask your leave . But though you have n't got a vote you can give a cheer for the right man , and Transome 's not a man like Garstin ; if you lost a day 's wages by giving a cheer for Transome , he 'll make you amends . That 's the way a man who has no vote can serve himself and his country ; he can lift up his hand and shout ' Transome forever ! ' ' hurray for Transome ! ' Let the workingmen let the colliers and navvies and stone - cutters , who between you and me have a good deal too much the worst of it , as things 128 are now let them join together and give their hands and voices for the right man , and they 'll make the great people shake in their shoes a little ; and when you shout for Transome , remember you shout for more wages , and more of your rights , and you shout to get rid of rats and sprats and such small animals , who are the tools the rich make use of to squeeze the blood out of the poor man . "
65304	65317	65319	65319	Dredge	305	" I wish there 'd be a row I 'd pommel him , "
65332	65485	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" No , no , my friend there you 're a little wrong . No pommelling no striking first . There you have the law and the constable against you . A little rolling in the dust and knocking hats off , a little pelting with soft things that 'll stick and not bruise all that does n't spoil the fun . If a man is to speak when you do n't like to hear him , it is but fair you should give him something he does n't like in return . And the same if he 's got a vote and does n't use it for the good of the country ; I see no harm in splitting his coat in a quiet way . A man must be taught what 's right if he does n't know it . But no kicks , no knocking down , no pommelling . "
65486	65501	65503	65504	Old Sleck	307	" It ' ud be good fun , though , if so - be , "
65512	65914	64511	64513	A few noes	2384	" Well , well , if a Spratt wants you to say Garstin , it 's some pleasure to think you can say Transome . Now , my notion is this . You are men who can put two and two together I do n't know a more solid lot of fellows than you are ; and what I say is , let the honest men in this country who 've got no vote show themselves in a body when they have got the chance . Why , sirs , for every Tory sneak that 's got a vote , there 's fifty - five fellows who must stand by and be expected to hold their tongues . But I say let 'em hiss the sneaks , let 'em groan at the sneaks , and the sneaks will be ashamed of themselves . The men who 've got votes do n't know how to use them . There 's many a fool with a vote , who is not sure in his mind whether he shall poll , say for Debarry , or Garstin , or Transome whether he 'll plump or whether he 'll split ; a straw will turn him . Let him know your mind if he does n't know his own . What 's the reason Debarry gets returned ? Because people are frightened at the Debarrys . What 's that to you ? You do n't care for the Debarrys . If people are frightened at the Tories , we 'll turn round and frighten them . You know what a Tory is one who wants to drive the workingman as he 'd drive cattle . That 's what a Tory is ; and a Whig is no better , if he 's 129 like Garstin . A Whig wants to knock the Tory down and get the whip , that 's all . But Transome 's neither Whig nor Tory ; he 's the workingman 's friend , the collier 's friend , the friend of the honest navvy . And if he gets into Parliament , let me tell you it will be better for you . I do n't say it will be the better for overlookers and screws , and rats and sprats ; but it will be the better for every good fellow who takes his pot at the Sugar Loaf . "

As long as three - fourths of the men in this country see nothing in an election but self - interest , and nothing in self - interest but some form of greed , one might as well try to purify the proceedings of the fishes , and say to a hungry cod - fish ' My good friend , abstain ; do n't goggle your eyes so , or show such a stupid gluttonous mouth , or think the little fishes are worth nothing except in relation to your own inside . ' He 'd be open to no argument short of crimping him . I should get into a rage with this fellow , and perhaps end by thrashing him . There 's some reason in me as long as I keep my temper , but my rash humor is drunkenness without wine . I should n't wonder if he upsets all my plans with these colliers . Of course he 's going to treat them for the sake of getting up a posse at the nomination and speechifyings . They 'll drink double , and never come near me on a Saturday evening . I do n't know what sort of man Transome really is . It 's no use my speaking to anybody else , but if I could get at him , he might put a veto on this thing . Though , when once the men have been promised and set a - going , the mischief is likely to be past mending . Hang the Liberal cod - fish ! I should n't have minded so much if he 'd been a Tory ! "

For all office , unless it be accompanied by peculiar grace , becomes , as it were , a diseased organ , seeking to make itself too much of a centre . Singers , specially so called , are , it must be confessed , an anomaly among us who seek to reduce the Church to its primitive simplicity , and to cast away all that may obstruct the direct communion of spirit with spirit . "

Brother Kemp would side with them , and draw the half part of the members after him . I can not but think it a snare when a professing Christian has a bass voice like Brother Kemp 's . It makes him desire to be heard of men ; but the weaker song of the humble may have more power in the ear of God . "

That caustic which you handle in order to scorch others , may happen to sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things . ' Tis difficult enough to see our way and keep our torch steady in this dim labyrinth : to whirl the torch and dazzle the eyes of our fellow - seekers is a poor daring , and may end in total darkness . You yourself are a lover of freedom , and a bold rebel against usurping authority . But the right to rebellion is the right to seek a higher rule , and not to wander in mere lawlessness . Wherefore , I beseech you , seem not to say that liberty is license . And I apprehend though I am not endowed with an ear to seize those earthly harmonies , which to some devout souls have seemed , as it were , the broken echoes of the heavenly choir I apprehend that there is a law in music , disobedience whereunto would bring us in our singing to the level of shrieking maniacs or howling beasts : so that herein we are well instructed how true liberty can be nought but the transfer of obedience from the will of one or of a few men to that will which is the norm or rule for all men . And though the transfer may sometimes be but an erroneous direction of search , yet is the search good and necessary to the ultimate finding . And even as in music , where all obey and concur to one end , so that each has the joy of contributing to a whole whereby he is ravished and lifted up into the courts of heaven , so will it be in that crowning time of the millennial reign , when our daily prayer will be fulfilled , and one law shall be written on all hearts , and be the very structure of all thought , and be the principle of all action . "

You are a known man , and I thought you would be kind enough to relieve me by taking charge of these things , and writing to Debarry , not mentioning me , and asking him to send some one for them , I found them on the grass in the park this evening about half - past seven , in the corner we cross going to Sproxton .

71788	71822	71824	71824	Esther	214	" Let me lift your porridge from before the fire , and stay with you , father . You think I 'm so naughty that I do n't like doing anything for you , "
71832	71851	71853	71854	the minister	1433	" Child , what has happened ? You have become the image of your mother to - night , "
71891	71899	71901	71901	Esther	214	" She was very good to you ? "
71905	71949	71868	71868	Esther	214	" Yes , dear . She did not reject my affection . She thought not scorn of my love . She would have forgiven me , if I had erred against her , from very tenderness . Could you forgive me , child ? "
71950	71970	71972	71972	Esther	214	" Father , I have not been good to you ; but I will be , I will be , "
71986	71998	71981	71981	He	2524	" Go to bed , dear ; I would be alone . "
72306	72322	72324	72325	Philip Debarry	267	" Stay , Christian , it may possibly refer to the lost pocket - book , "
72362	72380	72347	72348	Sir Maximus	152	" Here , you read it , Phil : the man writes a hand like small print . "
72644	72651	72653	72654	the rector	1106	" Well done , old Lyon , "
72656	72674	72653	72654	the rector	1106	" I did n't think that any composition of his would ever give me so much pleasure . "
72675	72683	72685	72686	Sir Maximus	152	" What an old fox it is ! "
72688	72706	72685	72686	Sir Maximus	152	" Why could n't he send 142 the things to me at once along with the letter ? "
72707	72720	72722	72723	the rector	1106	" No , no , Max ; he uses a justifiable caution , "
72754	72764	72765	72765	he	1106	" What are you going to do , Phil ? "
72773	72789	72791	72792	Mr. Debarry	267	" To write , of course . Those other matters are yours , I suppose ? "
72798	72803	72765	72765	he	1106	" Yes , sir . "
72804	72837	72765	72765	he	1106	" I shall send you with a letter to the preacher . You can describe your own property . And the seal , uncle was it your coat - of - arms ? "
72838	72892	72893	72894	the rector	1106	" No , it was this head of Achilles . Here , I can take it off the ring , and you can carry it , Christian . But do n't lose that , for I 've had it ever since eighteen hundred . I should like to send my compliments with it , "
72903	72954	72893	72894	the rector	1106	" and beg that since he has so much wise caution at command , he would exercise a little in more public matters , instead of making himself a firebrand in my parish , and teaching hucksters and tape - weavers that it 's their business to dictate to statesmen . "
72955	72977	72979	72980	Miss Selina	263	" How did Dissenters , and Methodists , and Quakers , and people of that sort first come up , uncle ? "
72997	73003	73009	73009	Harriet	264	" Dear me , Selina , "
73017	73033	73009	73009	Harriet	264	" do n't you remember ' Woodstock ' ? They were in Cromwell 's time . "
73034	73069	73071	73071	Selina	263	" Oh ! Holdenough , and those people ? Yes ; but they preached in the churches ; they had no chapels . Tell me , uncle Gus ; I like to be wise , "
73091	73100	73071	73071	Selina	263	" Phil says I 'm an ignorant puss . "
73101	73171	73071	73071	Selina	263	" The seeds of Nonconformity were sown at the Reformation , my dear , when some obstinate man made scruples about surplices and the place of the communion - table , and other trifles of that sort . But the Quakers came up about Cromwell 's time , and the Methodists only in the last century . The first Methodists were regular clergymen , the more 's the pity . "
73172	73187	73071	73071	Selina	263	" But all those wrong things , why did n't government put them down ? "
73188	73195	73198	73199	Sir Maximus	152	" Ah , to be sure , "
73209	73235	73071	73071	Selina	263	" Because error is often strong , and government is often weak , my dear . Well , Phil , have you finished your letter ? "
73236	73246	73248	73248	Philip	267	" Yes , I will read it to you , "
73606	73616	73618	73619	Sir Maximus	152	" You know best , Phil , of course , "
73632	73713	73618	73619	Sir Maximus	152	" But it seems to me you exaggerate preposterously every little service a man happens to do for you . Why should you make a general offer of that sort ? How do you know what he will be asking you to do ? Stuff and nonsense ! Tell Willis to send him a few head of game . You should think twice before you give a blank check of that sort to one of these quibbling , meddlesome Radicals . "
73714	73733	73735	73735	Philip	267	" You are afraid of my committing myself to ' the bottomless perjury of an et cetera , ' "
73747	73796	73735	73735	Philip	267	" But I think I am not doing any mischief ; at all events I could not be content to say less . And I have a notion that he would regard a present of game just now as an insult . I should , in his place . "
73798	73820	73822	73823	Sir Maximus	152	" Yes , yes , you ; but you do n't make yourself a measure of Dissenting preachers , I hope , "
73828	73836	73822	73823	Sir Maximus	152	" What do you say , Gus ? "
73837	73842	73844	73845	the rector	1106	" Phil is right , "
73852	73916	73844	73845	the rector	1106	" I would not deal with a Dissenter , or put profits into the pocket of a Radical which I might put into the pocket of a good Churchman and a quiet subject . But if the greatest scoundrel in the world made way for me , or picked my hat up , I would thank him . So would you , Max . "
73917	73933	73935	73936	Sir Maximus	152	" Pooh ! I did n't mean that one should n't behave like a gentleman , "
74433	74448	74459	74459	he	208	" I will ask him to write to write a description of the locket , "
74548	74556	74557	74557	he	208	" Let my path be henceforth simple , "
74569	74585	74557	74557	he	208	" let me seek to know what is , and if possible to declare it . "
74904	74926	74898	74900	the old man	1479	" The child will not be sorry to leave this poor home , and I shall be guilty in her sight . "
74967	75003	74965	74965	herself	212	" Here 's ever such a fine man from the Manor wants to see you , sir . Dear heart , dear heart ! shall I tell him you 're too bad to see him ? "
75004	75009	75011	75012	Mr. Lyon	208	" Show him up , "
75040	75046	75024	75025	the minister	1433	" Be seated , sir , "
75057	75068	75070	75070	Christian	333	" I 've brought you a letter from Mr. Debarry , "
75228	75339	75227	75227	servant	2595	" he could not avoid starting , and looking off the letter toward the bearer . Christian , knowing what was in the letter , conjectured that the old man was amazed to learn that so distinguished - looking a personage was a servant ; he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees , balanced his cane on his fingers , and began a whispering whistle . The minister checked himself , finished the reading of the letter , and then slowly and nervously put on his spectacles to survey this man , between whose fate and his own there might be a terrible collision . The word ' servant "
75362	75372	75374	75374	Christian	271	" Here is the seal mentioned in the letter , "
75398	75414	75376	75377	Mr. Lyon	208	" It is right , sir : I deliver the pocket - book to you . "
75433	75446	75424	75424	Christian	271	" The other things the chain and the little book are mine . "
75447	75452	75415	75415	He	208	" Your name then is "
75453	75457	75424	75424	Christian	271	" Maurice Christian . "
75500	75508	75424	75424	Christian	271	" And you have no other name ? "
75509	75515	75517	75517	Christian	271	" What do you mean ? "
75521	75530	75424	75424	Christian	271	" Be so good as to reseat yourself . "
75536	75546	75547	75547	he	271	" I 'm rather in a hurry , sir , "
75554	75585	75547	75547	he	271	" If it suits you to restore to me those small articles of mine , I shall be glad ; but I would rather leave them behind than be detained . "
75654	75666	75667	75667	he	208	" Nay , sir , I will not detain you unreasonably , "
75677	75687	75667	75667	he	208	" How long have these articles been your property ? "
75688	75697	75699	75699	Christian	271	" Oh , for more than twenty years , "
75725	75735	75667	75667	he	208	" You have been in France and in Germany ? "
75736	75747	75780	75780	Christian	271	" I have been in most countries on the continent . "
75748	75759	75761	75762	Mr. Lyon	208	" Be so good as to write me your name , "
75828	75837	75838	75838	he	208	" Before I oblige you there , sir , "
75853	75991	75838	75838	he	208	" I must know exactly the reasons you have for putting these questions to me . You are a stranger to me an excellent person , I dare say but I have no concern about you farther than to get from you those small articles . Do you still doubt that they are mine ? You wished , I think , that I should tell you what the locket is like . It has a pair of hands and blue flowers on one side and the name Annette round the hair on the other side . That is all I have to say . If you wish for anything more from me , you will be good enough to tell me why you wish it . Now then , sir , what is your concern with me ? "
76247	76274	76238	76238	He	208	" It is true , sir ; you have told me all I can demand . I have no sufficient reason for detaining your property further . "
76308	76322	76304	76304	he	208	" Very good , sir . I wish you a good - morning . "
76323	76328	76330	76331	Mr. Lyon	208	" Good - morning , "
76410	76463	76395	76395	Christian	271	" This old fellow has got some secret in his head . It 's not likely he can know anything about me : it must be about Bycliffe . But Bycliffe was a gentleman : how should he ever have had anything to do with such a seedy old ranter as that ? "
76621	76672	76593	76594	Philip Debarry	267	" I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling , in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct . "
77699	77750	77693	77693	I	0	" I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling , in that full and speedy relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct . "
78346	78366	78311	78312	Mr. Lyon	208	" Let the matter rest : seek to know no more ; know only what is thrust upon you . "
78468	78471	78463	78466	no confidant or helper	2672	" the brethren "
78700	78711	78693	78693	she	214	" You recollect what I told you yesterday , father ? "
78712	78719	78721	78722	Mr. Lyon	208	" Nay , child ; what ? "
78727	78746	78693	78693	she	214	" That Mr. Jermyn asked me if you would probably be at home this morning before one o'clock . "
78771	78796	78747	78747	Esther	214	" Assuredly ; I do not intend to move from my study after I have once been out to hand this letter to Zachary . "
78797	78850	78747	78747	Esther	214	" Shall I tell Lyddy to take him up at once to your study if he comes ? If not , I shall have to stay in my own room , because I shall be at home all this morning , and it is rather cold now to sit without a fire . "
78851	78907	78940	78940	her	214	" Yes , my dear , let him come up to me ; unless , indeed , he should bring a second person , which might happen , seeing that in all likelihood he is coming , as hitherto , on electioneering business . And I could not well accommodate two visitors up - stairs . "
78987	79065	78970	78970	she	214	" if it was the gentleman as came on Thursday in the pepper - and - salt coat , was he to be shown up - stairs ? And the gentleman from the Manor yesterday as went out whistling had Miss Esther heard about him ? There seemed no end of these great folks coming to Malthouse Yard since there was talk of the election ; but they might be poor lost creatures the most of 'em . "
79466	79468	79460	79460	she	214	" one "
80084	80090	80091	80091	she	214	" My father expected you , "
80097	80112	80091	80091	she	214	" I delivered your letter to him yesterday . He will be down immediately . "
80125	80138	80140	80140	Harold	144	" I hope you are not going to let us disturb you , "
80146	80163	80140	80140	Harold	144	" We come to discuss election affairs , and we particularly desire to interest the ladies . "
80164	80181	80183	80183	Esther	214	" I have no interest with any one who is not already on the right side , "
80186	80201	80140	80140	Harold	144	" I am happy to see at least that you wear the Liberal colors . "
80202	80232	80233	80233	Esther	214	" I fear I must confess that it is more from love of blue than from love of Liberalism . Yellow opinions could only have brunettes on their side . "
80260	80289	80233	80233	Esther	214	" If my cause is to be recommended by the becomingness of my colors , then I am sure you are acting in my interest by wearing them . "
80297	80303	80305	80305	Harold	144	" Must you really go ? "
80315	80329	80331	80331	Esther	214	" Yes , I have an engagement a lesson at half past twelve , "
80577	80596	80598	80598	Harold	144	" I am very glad to have secured this opportunity of making your personal acquaintance , Mr. Lyon , "
80614	80668	80598	80598	Harold	144	" I am to address the electors here , in the Market - Place , to - morrow ; and I should have been sorry to do so without first paying my respects privately to my chief friends , as there may be points on which they particularly wish me to explain myself . "
80669	80679	80681	80682	Mr. Lyon	208	" You speak civilly , sir , and reasonably , "
80703	80717	80681	80682	Mr. Lyon	208	" Pray be seated , gentlemen . It is my habit to stand . "
80847	80857	80859	80859	Harold	144	" I am aware Mr. Jermyn has told me , "
80861	80959	80859	80859	Harold	144	" what good service you have done me already , Mr. Lyon . The fact is , a man of intellect 158 like you was especially needed in my case . The race I am running is really against Garstin only , who calls himself a Liberal , though he cares for nothing , and understands nothing , except the interests of the wealthy traders . And you have been able to explain the difference between Liberal and Liberal , which , as you and I know , is something like the difference between fish and fish . "
80960	80969	80971	80972	Mr. Lyon	208	" Your comparison is not unapt , sir , "
80982	81166	80971	80972	Mr. Lyon	208	" at this epoch , when the mind of the nation has been strained on the passing of one measure . Where a great weight has to be moved , we require not so much selected instruments as abundant horse - power . But it is an unavoidable evil of these massive achievements that they encourage a coarse undiscriminatingness obstructive of more nicely - wrought results , and an exaggerated expectation inconsistent with the intricacies of our fallen and struggling condition . I say not that compromise is unnecessary , but it is an evil attendant on our imperfection ; and I would pray every one to mark that , where compromise broadens , intellect and conscience are thrust into narrower room . Wherefore it has been my object to show our people that there are many who have helped to draw the car of Reform , whose ends are but partial , and who forsake not the ungodly principle of selfish alliances , but would only substitute Syria for Egypt thinking chiefly of their own share in peacocks , gold and ivory . "
81167	81171	81173	81173	Harold	144	" Just so , "
81199	81431	81173	81173	Harold	144	" men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in a plutocracy , buy up the land , and stick the old crests on their new gateways . Now the practical point to secure against these false Liberals at present is , that our electors should not divide their votes . As it appears that many who vote for Debarry are likely to split their votes in favor of Garstin , it is of the first consequence that my voters should give me plumpers . If they divide their votes they ca n't keep out Debarry , and they may help to keep out me . I feel some confidence in asking you to use your influence in this direction , Mr. Lyon . We candidates have to praise ourselves more than is graceful ; but you are aware that , while I belong by my birth to the classes that have their roots in tradition and all the old loyalties , my experience has lain chiefly among those who make their own career , and depend on the new rather than the old . I have had the advantage of considering the 159 national welfare under varied lights : I have wider views than those of a mere cotton lord . On questions connected with religious liberty I would stop short at no measure that was not thorough . "
81432	81442	81444	81445	Mr. Lyon	208	" I hope not , sir I hope not , "
81782	81815	81777	81777	he	173	" I must really be at the office in five minutes . You will find me there , Mr. Transome ; you have probably still many things to say to Mr. Lyon . "
81816	81823	81825	81826	the minister	1433	" I beseech you , sir , "
81843	81865	81837	81837	his	1433	" I beseech you to favor me with an interview on some private business this evening , if it were possible . "
82006	82011	82013	82014	Mrs. Muscat	249	" An odd man , "
82017	82036	82013	82014	Mrs. Muscat	249	" to have such a gift in the pulpit . But there 's One knows better than we do "
82069	82074	82075	82075	he	173	" By all means , "
82081	82092	82075	82075	he	173	" Could you come to my office at eight o'clock ? "
82093	82107	82059	82059	Jermyn	173	" For several reasons , I must beg you to come to me . "
82108	82140	82141	82141	Jermyn	173	" Oh , very good . I 'll walk out and see you this evening , if possible . I shall have much pleasure in being of any use to you . "
82249	82253	82217	82218	ardent Reformers	2752	" bloated paupers , "
82254	82258	82217	82218	ardent Reformers	2752	" bloated pluralists , "
82368	82373	82376	82379	the speakers at Reform	2757	" a dry election . "
82551	82560	82562	82562	Harold	144	" I have no objection to the ballot , "
82564	82595	82562	82562	Harold	144	" but I think that is not the sort of thing we have to work at just now . We should n't get it . And other questions are imminent . "
82596	82608	82610	82611	Mr. Lyon	208	" Then , sir , you would vote for the ballot ? "
82617	82651	82562	82562	Harold	144	" Certainly , if the point came up . I have too much respect for the freedom of the voter to oppose anything which offers a chance of making that freedom more complete . "
82665	82670	82652	82653	Mr. Lyon	208	" h'm m m , "
82685	82842	82652	82653	Mr. Lyon	208	" You grieve me , sir ; you grieve me much . And I pray you to reconsider this question , for it will take you to the root , as I think , of political morality . I engage to show to any impartial mind , duly furnished with the principles of public and private rectitude , that the ballot would be pernicious , and that if it were not pernicious , it would still be futile . I will show , first , that it would be futile as a preservative from bribery and illegitimate influence ; and , secondly , that it would be in the worst kind pernicious , as shutting the door against those influences whereby the soul of a man and the character of a citizen are duly educated for their great functions . Be not alarmed if I detain you , sir . It is well worth the while . "
82843	82849	82851	82851	Harold	144	" Confound this old man , "
82853	82876	82851	82851	Harold	144	" I 'll never make a canvassing call on a preacher again , unless he has lost his voice from a cold . "
82938	82985	82933	82933	her	212	" If you please , sir , here 's Mr. Holt wants to know if he may come in and speak to the gentleman . He begs your pardon , but you 're to say ' no ' if you do n't like him to come . "
82986	83001	83002	83003	Mr. Lyon	208	" Nay , show him in at once , Lyddy . A young man , "
83011	83029	83002	83003	Mr. Lyon	208	" whom a representative ought to know no voter , but a man of ideas and study . "
83030	83036	83038	83038	Harold	144	" He is thoroughly welcome , "
83095	83101	83103	83104	the minister	1433	" Mr. Holt , sir , "
83110	83145	83103	83104	the minister	1433	" is a young friend of mine , whose opinions on some points I hope to see altered , but who has a zeal for public justice which I trust he will never lose . "
83146	83155	83157	83157	Harold	144	" I am glad to see Mr. Holt , "
83197	83202	83203	83203	he	144	" A formidable fellow , "
83206	83236	83203	83203	he	144	" capable of mounting a cart in the market - place to - morrow and cross - examining me , if I say anything that does n't please him . "
83237	83241	83243	83243	Felix	134	" Mr. Lyon , "
83245	83341	83243	83243	Felix	134	" I have taken a liberty with you in asking to see Mr. Transome when he is engaged with you . But I have to speak to him on a matter which I should n't care to make public at present , and it is one on which I am sure you will back me . I heard that Mr. Transome was here , so I ventured to come . I hope you will both excuse me , as my business refers to some electioneering measures which are being taken by Mr. Transome 's agents . "
83342	83347	83349	83349	Harold	144	" Pray go on , "
83355	83366	83368	83368	Felix	134	" I 'm not going to speak against treating voters , "
83370	83451	83368	83368	Felix	134	" I suppose buttered ale , and grease of that sort to make the wheels go , belong to the necessary humbug of representation . But I wish to ask you , Mr. Transome , whether it is with your knowledge that agents of yours are bribing rough fellows who are no voters the colliers and navvies at Sproxton with the chance of extra drunkenness , that they may make a posse on your side at the nomination and polling ? "
83452	83456	83458	83458	Harold	144	" Certainly not , "
83460	83517	83458	83458	Harold	144	" You are aware , my dear sir , that a candidate is very much at the mercy of his agents as to the means by which he is returned , especially when many years ' absence has made him a stranger to the men actually conducting business . But are you sure of your facts ? "
83519	83529	83531	83531	Felix	134	" As sure as my senses can make me , "
83543	83557	83558	83558	he	2778	" I believed that you were ignorant of all this , Mr. Transome , "
83561	83663	83558	83558	he	2778	" and that was why I thought some good might be done by speaking to you . If not , I should be tempted to expose the whole affair as a disgrace to the Radical party . I 'm a Radical myself , and mean to work all my life long against privilege , monopoly , and oppression . But I would rather be a livery - servant proud of my master 's title , than I would seem to make common cause with scoundrels who turn the best hopes of men into by - words for ca nt and dishonesty . "
83664	83674	83676	83676	Harold	144	" Your energetic protest is needless here , sir , "
83837	83849	83850	83850	he	144	" If you choose to accompany me to Jermyn 's office , "
83854	83885	83850	83850	he	144	" the matter shall be enquired into in your presence . I think you will agree with me , Mr. Lyon , that this will be the most satisfactory course . "
83886	83889	83891	83892	the minister	1433	" Doubtless , "
83911	83950	83891	83892	the minister	1433	" and I would caution my young friend against a too great hastiness of words and action . David 's cause against Saul was a righteous one ; nevertheless not all who clave unto David were righteous men . "
83951	83960	83962	83962	Felix	134	" The more was the pity , sir , "
83964	83973	83962	83962	Felix	134	" Especially if he winked at their malpractices . "
83990	84008	84010	84010	Harold	144	" It is rather too much for any man to keep the consciences of all his party , "
84012	84097	84010	84010	Harold	144	" If you had lived in the East , as I have , you 164 would be more tolerant , for example , of an active industrious selfishness , such as we have here , though it may not always be quite scrupulous : you would see how much better it is than an idle selfishness . I have heard it said , a bridge is a good thing worth helping to make , though half the men who worked at it were rogues . "
84098	84103	84105	84105	Felix	134	" Oh , yes ! "
84109	84179	84105	84105	Felix	134	" give me a handful of generalities and analogies , and I 'll undertake to justify Burke and Hare , and prove them benefactors of their species . I 'll tolerate no nuisances but such as I ca n't help ; and the question now is , not whether we can do away with all the nuisances in the world , but with a particular nuisance under our noses . "
84180	84202	84204	84204	Harold	144	" Then we had better cut the matter short , as I propose , by going at once to Jermyn 's , "
84206	84222	84204	84204	Harold	144	" In that case , I must bid you good - morning , Mr. Lyon . "
84223	84228	84230	84231	the minister	1433	" I would fain , "
84235	84284	84204	84204	Harold	144	" I would fain have had a further opportunity of considering that question of the ballot with you . The reasons against it need not be urged lengthily ; they only require complete enumeration to prevent any seeming hiatus , where an opposing fallacy might trust itself in . "
84285	84291	84293	84293	Harold	144	" Never fear , sir , "
84302	84322	84296	84297	Mr. Lyon	208	" there will be opportunities . Shall I not see you in the committee - room to - morrow ? "
84323	84328	84330	84331	Mr. Lyon	208	" I think not , "
84346	84372	84342	84342	his	208	" But I will send you , if you will permit me , a brief writing , on which you can meditate at your leisure . "
84373	84383	84392	84393	the minister	1433	" I shall be delighted . Good - bye . "
85123	85156	85117	85117	he	144	" A question about the electioneering at Sproxton . Can you give your attention to it at once ? Here is Mr. Holt , who has come to me about the business . "
85157	85163	85165	85165	Jermyn	173	" A yes a certainly , "
85208	85234	85183	85183	He	173	" Mr. Holt a will doubtless a make a point of saving a busy man 's time . You can speak at once . This gentleman "
85245	85258	85236	85236	Jermyn	173	" is one of ourselves ; he is a true - blue . "
85259	85266	85268	85268	Felix	134	" I have simply to complain , "
85270	85317	85268	85268	Felix	134	" that one of your agents has been sent on a bribing expedition to Sproxton with what purpose you , sir , may know better than I do . Mr. Transome , it appears , was ignorant of the affair , and does not approve it . "
85371	85381	85383	85383	Harold	144	" I do n't approve of it at all , "
85398	85412	85383	85383	Harold	144	" Be good enough to put a stop to it , will you ? "
85413	85425	85427	85427	Jermyn	173	" Mr. Holt , I know , is an excellent Liberal , "
85447	85532	85427	85427	Jermyn	173	" but he is perhaps too inexperienced to be aware that no canvass a can be conducted without the action of able men , who must a be trusted , and not interfered with . And as to any possibility of promising to put a stop a to any procedure a that depends . If he had ever held the coachman 's ribbons in his hands , as I have in my younger days a he would know that stopping is not always easy . "
85533	85542	85544	85544	Felix	134	" I know very little about holding ribbons , "
85547	85608	85544	85544	Felix	134	" but I saw clearly enough at once that more mischief had been done than could be well mended . Though I believe , if it were heartily tried , the treatment might be reduced and something might be done to hinder the men from turning out in a body to make a noise , which might end in worse . "
85609	85622	85624	85624	Jermyn	173	" They might be hindered from making a noise on our side , "
85628	85652	85624	85624	Jermyn	173	" That is perfectly true . But if they made a noise on the other would your purpose be answered better , sir ? "
85690	85696	85698	85698	Felix	134	" I can only say , "
85700	85748	85698	85698	Felix	134	" that if you make use of those heavy fellows when the drink is in them , I should n't like your responsibility . You might as well drive bulls to roar on our side as bribe a set of colliers and navvies to shout and groan . "
85749	85763	85765	85765	Jermyn	173	" A lawyer may well envy your command of language , Mr. Holt , "
85778	85920	85765	85765	Jermyn	173	" but he would not be satisfied with the accuracy a of your terms . You must permit me to check your use of the word ' bribery . ' The essence of bribery is , that it should be legally proved ; there is not such a thing a in rerum natura a as unproved bribery . There has been no such thing as bribery at Sproxton , I 'll answer for it . The presence of a body of stalwart fellows on a the Liberal side will tend to preserve order ; for we know that the benefit clubs from the Pitchley district will show for Debarry . Indeed , the gentleman who has conducted the canvass at Sproxton is experienced in Parliamentary affairs , and would not exceed a the necessary measures that a rational judgment would dictate . "
85921	85933	85935	85935	Felix	134	" What ! you mean the man who calls himself Johnson ? "
85959	86005	86007	86007	Harold	144	" The long and short of it is this , Mr. Holt : I shall desire and insist that whatever can be done by way of remedy shall be done . Will that satisfy you ? You see now some of the candidate 's difficulties ? "
86016	86027	86007	86007	Harold	144	" I hope you will have some pity for me . "
86028	86036	86038	86038	Felix	134	" I suppose I must be content , "
86044	86054	86038	86038	Felix	134	" I bid you good - morning , gentlemen . "
86089	86110	86086	86086	Jermyn	173	" And who is Johnson ? an alias , I suppose . It seems you are fond of the name . "
86163	86168	86169	86169	Jermyn	173	" On the contrary , "
86172	86295	86169	86169	Jermyn	173	" the Johnson in question is this gentleman , whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you as one of my most active helpmates in electioneering business Mr. Johnson , of Bedford Row , London . I am comparatively a novice a in these matters . But he was engaged with James Putty in two hardly - contested elections , and there could scarcely be a better initiation . Putty is one of the first men of the country as an agent a on the Liberal side a eh , Johnson ? I think Makepiece is a not altogether a match for him , not quite of the same calibre a haud consimili ingenio a in tactics a and in experience ? "
86296	86308	86310	86312	the glib Johnson	309	" Makepiece is a wonderful man , and so is Putty , "
86334	86350	86351	86351	he	309	" Makepiece for scheming , but Putty for management . Putty knows men , sir , "
86359	86687	86351	86351	he	309	" it 's a thousand pities that you have not had his talents employed in your service . He 's beyond any man for saving a candidate 's money does half the work with his tongue . He 'll talk of anything , from the Areopagus , and that sort of thing , down to the joke about ' Where are you going , Paddy ? ' you know what I mean , sir ! ' Back again , says Paddy ' an excellent electioneering joke . Putty understands these things . He has said to me , ' Johnson , bear in mind there are two ways of speaking an audience will always like : one is to tell them what they do n't understand ; and the other is , to tell them what they 're used to . ' I shall never be the man to deny that I owe a great deal to Putty . I always say it was a most providential thing in the Mugham election last year that Putty was not on the Tory side . He managed the women ; and , if you 'll believe me , sir , one - fourth of the men would never have voted if their wives had n't driven them to it for the good of their families . And as for speaking it 's currently reported in our London circles 169 that Putty writes regularly for the Times . He has that kind of language ; and I need n't tell you , Mr. Transome , that it 's the apex , which , I take it , means the tiptop and nobody can get higher than that , I think . I 've belonged to a political debating society myself ; I 've heard a little language in my time ; but when Mr. Jermyn first spoke to me about having the honor to assist in your canvass of North Loamshire "
86704	86825	86689	86689	Johnson	309	" the very first thing I said was , ' And there 's Garstin has got Putty ! No Whig could stand against a Whig , ' I said , ' who had Putty on his side : I hope Mr. Transome goes in for something of a deeper color . ' I do n't say that , as a general rule , opinions go for much in a return , Mr. Transome ; it depends on who are in the field before you , and on the skill of your agents . But as a Radical , and a moneyed Radical , you are in a fine position , sir ; and with care and judgment with care and judgment "
86947	86991	86939	86939	Harold	144	" Well then , Mr. Johnson , I shall be glad if you will use your care and judgment in putting an end , as well as you can , to this Sproxton affair ; else it may turn out an ugly business . "
86992	87301	87303	87304	Mr. Johnson	309	" Excuse me , sir ; I must beg you to look at the matter a little more closely . You will see that it is impossible to take a single step backward at Sproxton . It was a matter of necessity to get the Sproxton men ; else I know to a certainty the other side would have laid hold of them first , and now I 've undermined Garstin 's people . They 'll use their authority , and give a little shabby treating , but I 've taken all the wind out of their sails . But if , by your orders , I or Mr. Jermyn here were to break promise with the honest fellows , and offend Chubb the publican , what would come of it ? Chubb would leave no stone unturned against you , sir ; he would egg on his customers against you ; the 170 colliers and navvies would be at the nomination and the election all the same , or rather not all the same , for they would be there against us ; and instead of hustling people good - humoredly by way of a joke , and counterbalancing Debarry 's cheers , they 'd help to kick the cheering and voting out of our men , and instead of being , let us say , half - a - dozen ahead of Garstin , you 'd be half - a - dozen behind him , that 's all . I speak plain English to you , Mr. Transome , though I 've the highest respect for you as a gentleman of first - rate talents and position . But , sir , to judge of these things a man must know the English voter and the English publican ; and it would be a poor tale indeed "
87315	87379	87303	87304	Mr. Johnson	309	" that a gentleman like you , to say nothing of the good of the country , should have gone to the expense and trouble of a canvass for nothing but to find himself out of Parliament at the end of it . I 've seen it again and again ; it looks bad in the cleverest man to have to sing small . "
87468	87480	87482	87482	Johnson	309	" As to undoing anything that 's been done down there , "
87494	87604	87482	87482	Johnson	309	" I must wash my hands of it , sir . I could n't work knowingly against your interest . And that young man who is just gone out , you do n't believe that he need be listened to , I hope ? Chubb , the publican , hates him . Chubb would guess he was at the bottom of your having the treating stopped , and he 'd set half - a - dozen of the colliers to duck him in the canal , or break his head by mistake . I 'm an experienced man , sir . I hope I 've put it clear enough . "
87605	87614	87616	87616	Harold	144	" Certainly , the exposition befits the subject , "
87638	87666	87633	87633	Jermyn	173	" It 's a damned , unpleasant , ravelled business that you and Mr. Jermyn have knit up between you . I 've no more to say . "
87667	87696	87698	87698	Johnson	309	" Then , sir , if you 've no more commands , I do n't wish to intrude . I shall wish you good - morning , sir , "
87893	87901	87903	87903	Jermyn	173	" A pardon me , Mr. Harold , "
87913	87962	87903	87903	Jermyn	173	" but I am sorry a you should behave disobligingly to a man who has it in his power to do much service who , in fact , holds many threads in his hands . I admit that a nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit , as we say a "
87963	87968	87970	87970	Harold	144	" Speak for yourself , "
87972	88007	87970	87970	Harold	144	" I do n't talk in tags of Latin , which might be learned by a school - master 's foot - boy . I find the King 's English expresses my meaning better . "
88008	88017	88019	88019	Jermyn	173	" In the King 's English , then , "
88031	88044	88019	88019	Jermyn	173	" a candidate should keep his kicks till he 's a member . "
88045	88068	87970	87970	Harold	144	" Oh , I suppose Johnson will bear a kick if you bid him . You 're his principal , I believe . "
88069	88090	88019	88019	Jermyn	173	" Certainly , thus far a he is my London agent . But he is a man of substance , and "
88091	88136	87970	87970	Harold	144	" I shall know what he is if it 's necessary , I dare say . But I must jump into the carriage again . I 've no time to lose ; I must go to Hawkins at the factory . Will you go ? "
88226	88245	88247	88247	Jermyn	173	" He means to see to the bottom of everything if he can , that 's quite plain , "
88251	88390	88247	88247	Jermyn	173	" I believe he has been getting another 172 opinion ; he has some new light about those annuities on the estate that are held in Johnson 's name . He has inherited a deuced faculty for business there 's no denying that . But I shall beg leave to tell him that I 've propped up the family . I do n't know where they would have been without me ; and if it comes to balancing , I know into which scale the gratitude ought to go . Not that he 's likely to feel any but he can feel something else ; and if he makes signs of setting the dogs on me , I shall make him feel it . The people named Transome owe me a good deal more than I owe them . "
89012	89018	89020	89020	others	1301	" their family had been Church "
89518	89529	89492	89492	Esther	214	" Come , father , you have forgotten your breakfast . "
89530	89541	89542	89542	he	208	" It is true , child , I will come , "
89552	89559	89561	89561	Esther	214	" Oh , you naughty father ! "
89571	89607	89561	89561	Esther	214	" your coat - collar is twisted , your waistcoat is buttoned all wrong , and you have not brushed your hair . Sit down and let me brush it again as I did yesterday . "
89815	89846	89811	89811	she	214	" Father , I shall make a petit ma tre of you by - and - by ; your hair looks so pretty and silken when it is well brushed . "
89847	90041	89811	89811	she	214	" Nay , child , I trust that while I would willingly depart from my evil habit of a somewhat slovenly forgetfulness in my attire , I shall never arrive at the opposite extreme . For though there is that in apparel which pleases the eye , and I deny not that your neat gown and the color thereof which is that of certain little flowers that spread themselves in the hedgerows , and make a blueness there as of the sky when it is deepened in the water I deny not , I say , that these minor strivings after a perfection which is , as it were , an irrecoverable yet haunting memory , are a good in their proportion . Nevertheless , the brevity of our life , and the hurry and crush of the great battle with error and sin , often oblige us to an advised neglect of what is less momentous . This , I conceive , is the principle on which my friend Felix Holt acts ; and I can not but think the light comes from the true fount , though it shines through obstructions . "
90042	90057	89811	89811	she	214	" You have not seen Mr. Holt since Sunday , have you , father ? "
90058	90117	90118	90119	Mr. Lyon	208	" Yes , he was here yesterday . He sought Mr. Transome , having a matter of some importance to speak upon with him . And I saw him afterward in the street , when he agreed that I should call for him this morning before I go into the market - place . He will have it , "
90125	90144	90118	90119	Mr. Lyon	208	" that I must not walk about in the crowd without him to act as my special constable . "
90290	90314	90288	90288	she	214	" I should have liked to hear Mr. Transome speak , but I suppose it is too late to get a place now . "
90315	90335	90337	90338	Mr. Lyon	208	" I am not sure , I would fain have you go if you desire it , my dear , "
90351	90389	90337	90338	Mr. Lyon	208	" Walk with me to Mrs. Holt 's , and we will learn from Felix , who will doubtless already have been out , whether or not he could lead you in safety to Friend Lambert 's . "
91097	91103	91104	91104	He	2908	" Cock - fighting Jack . "
91176	91179	91174	91174	he	2908	" a charicter "
91260	91263	91239	91240	the Dissenters	1366	" hurray . "
91264	91276	91282	91282	them	2914	" Let 's hear what old Jack will say for himself , "
91284	91299	91282	91282	them	2914	" he 'll have something funny to say , I 'll bet a penny . "
91339	91348	91371	91371	his	2908	" Cock - a - doodle - doo . "
91349	91356	91357	91357	he	2908	" Come now , my lads , "
91383	91421	91357	91357	he	2908	" I 'll tell you what ; I 'm a parson you know ; I ought to return good for evil . So here are some good nuts for you to crack in return for your shells . "
91442	91677	91431	91431	he	2908	" Come now , you 'll say I used to be a Tory ; and some of you , whose faces I know as well as I know the head of my own crab - stick , will say that 's why I 'm a good fellow . But now I 'll tell you something else . It 's for that very reason that I used to be a Tory , and am a good fellow that I go along with my nephew here , who is a thorough - going Liberal . For will anybody here come forward and say , ' A good fellow has no need to tack about and change his road ? ' No , there 's not one of you such a Tom - noddy . What 's good for one time is bad for another . If anybody contradicts that , ask him to eat pickled pork when he 's thirsty , and to bathe in the Lapp there when the spikes of ice are shooting . And that 's the reason why the men who are the best Liberals now are the very men who used to be the best Tories . There is n't a nastier horse than your horse that 'll jib and back and turn round when there is but one road for him to go , and that 's the road before him .
91678	92249	91439	91440	the crowd	7179	" And my nephew here he comes of a Tory breed , you know I 'll answer for the Lingons . In the old Tory times there was never a pup belonged to a Lingon but would howl if a Whig came near him . The Lingon blood is good , rich old Tory blood like good rich milk and that 's why , when the right time comes , it throws up a liberal cream . The best sort of Tory turns to the best sort of Radical . There 's plenty of Radical scum I say , beware of the scum , and look but for the cream . And here 's my nephew some 179 of the cream , if there is any : none of your Whigs , none of your painted water that looks as if it ran , and it 's standing still all the while ; none of your spinning - jenny fellows . A gentleman ; but up to all sorts of business . I 'm no fool myself ; I 'm forced to wink a good deal , for fear of seeing too much , for a neighborly man must let himself be cheated a little . But though I 've never been out of my own country , I know less about it than my nephew does . You may tell what he is , and only look at him . There 's one sort of fellow sees nothing but the end of his own nose , and another sort that sees nothing but the hinder side of the moon ; but my nephew Harold is of another sort ; he sees everything that 's at hitting distance , and he 's not one to miss his mark . A good - looking man in his prime ! Not a greenhorn ; not a shrivelled old fellow , who 'll come to speak to you and find he 's left his teeth at home by mistake . Harold Transome will do you credit ; if anybody says the Radicals are a set of sneaks , Brummagem half - pennies , scamps who want to play pitch - and - toss with the property of the country , you can say , ' Look at the member for North Loamshire ! ' And mind what you 'll hear him say ; he 'll go in for making everything right Poor - laws and Charities and Church he wants to reform 'em all . Perhaps you 'll say , ' There 's that Parson Lingon talking about Church Reform why , he belongs to the Church himself he wants reforming too . ' Well , well , wait a bit , and you 'll hear by - and - by that old Parson Lingon is reformed shoots no more , cracks his joke no more , has drunk his last bottle : the dogs , the old pointers , will be sorry ; but you 'll hear that the Parson at Little Treby is a new man . That 's what Church Reform is sure to come to before long . So now here are some more nuts for you , lads , and I leave you to listen to your candidate . Here he is give him a good hurray ; wave your hats , and I 'll begin . Hurray ! "

92862	92913	92814	92814	Christian	333	" Not so . It is true I was confused a meenute I could put your face nowhere ; but , after that , Naples came behind it , and I said , Mr. Creesstian . And so you reside at the Manor , and I am at Transome Court . "
92914	92939	92941	92941	Christian	333	" Ah ! it 's a thousand pities you 're not on our side , else we might have dined together at the Marquis , "
92943	92951	92952	92952	he	333	" Eh , could you manage it ? "
92966	92988	92990	92990	Dominic	150	" No much obliged could n't leave the leetle boy . Ahi ! Arry , Arry , pinch not poor Moro . "
93062	93068	93070	93070	Christian	333	" Who are those ladies ? "
93094	93102	93104	93104	Dominic	150	" They are Meester Jermyn 's daughters , "
93131	93138	93139	93139	he	333	" Oh , well au revoir , "
93165	93175	93177	93177	Jermyn	145	" Does he see some likeness in the girl ? "
93184	93202	93177	93177	Jermyn	145	" I wish I had n't invited her to come in the carriage , as it happens . "
93206	93222	93177	93177	Jermyn	145	" Good earthenware pitchers , sir ! of an excellent quaint pattern and sober color . "

94175	94236	94156	94156	he	367	" Transome may be returned , or he may not be returned that 's a question for North Loamshire ; but it makes little difference to the kingdom . I do n't want to say things which may put younger men out of spirits , but I believe this country has seen it 's best days I do , indeed . "
94237	94253	94255	94256	the brewer	2974	" I am sorry to hear it from one of your experience , Mr. Nolan , "
94266	94472	94255	94256	the brewer	2974	" I 'd make a good fight myself before I 'd leave a worse world for my boys than I 've found for myself . There is n't a greater pleasure than doing a bit of planting and improving one 's buildings , and investing one 's money in some pretty acres of land , and when it turns up here and there land you 've known from a boy . It 's a nasty thought that these Radicals are to turn things round so as one can calculate on nothing . One does n't like it for one 's self , and one does n't like it for one 's neighbors . But somehow , I believe it wo n't 184 do : if we ca n't trust the Government just now , there 's Providence and the good sense of the country ; and there 's a right in things that 's what I 've always said there 's a right in things . The heavy end will get downmost . And if Church and King , and every man being sure of his own , are things good for this country , there 's a God above will take care of 'em . "
94473	94483	94485	94486	Mr. Nolan	367	" It wo n't do , my dear sir , "
94487	94559	94584	94584	he	367	" It wo n't do . When Peel and the Duke turned round about the Catholics in ' 29 , I saw it was all over with us . We could never trust ministers any more . It was to keep off a rebellion , they said ; but I say it was to keep their places . They 're monstrously fond of place , both of them that I know . "
94587	94664	94584	94584	he	367	" What we want is a king with a good will of his own . If we 'd had that , we should n't have heard what we 've heard to - day ; Reform would never have come to this pass . When our good old King George III . heard his ministers talking about Catholic Emancipation , he boxed their ears all round . Ah , poor soul ! he did indeed , gentlemen , "
94677	94689	94691	94692	Mr. Crowder	279	" Well , now , that 's something like a king , "
94700	94713	94715	94717	Mr. Timothy Rose	373	" It was uncivil , though . How did they take it ? "
94720	94723	94584	94584	he	367	" gentleman farmer "
94780	94792	94794	94797	the impetuous young Joyce	3017	" Take it ! they 'd be obliged to take it , "
94805	94816	94794	94797	the impetuous young Joyce	3017	" Have you ever heard of the king 's prerogative ? "
94817	94827	94829	94829	Rose	373	" I do n't say but what I have , "
94833	94843	94829	94829	Rose	373	" I 've nothing against it nothing at all . "
94844	94852	94854	94855	young Joyce	374	" No , but the Radicals have , "
94859	94899	94854	94855	young Joyce	374	" The prerogative is what they want to clip close . They want us to be governed by delegates from the trades - unions , who are to dictate to everybody , and make everything square to their mastery . "
94900	94912	94914	94915	Mr. Wace	203	" They 're a pretty set , now , these delegates , "
94920	95049	94914	94915	Mr. Wace	203	" I once heard two of 'em spouting away . They 're a sort of 185 fellow I 'd never employ in my brewery , or anywhere else . I 've seen it again and again . If a man takes to tongue - work it 's all over with him . ' Everything 's wrong , ' says he . That 's a big text . But does he want to make everything right ? Not he . He 'd lose his text . ' We want every man 's good , ' say they . Why , they never knew yet what a man 's good is . How should they ? It 's working for his victual not getting a slice of other people 's . "
95050	95055	95057	95058	young Joyce	374	" Ay , ay , "
95062	95119	95057	95058	young Joyce	374	" I should just have liked all the delegates in the country mustered for our yeomanry to go into that 's all . They 'd see where the strength of Old England lay then . You may tell what it is for a country to trust to trade when it breeds such spindling fellows as those . "
95120	95133	95135	95136	Mr. Nolan	367	" That is n't the fault of trade , my good sir , "
95151	95338	95135	95136	Mr. Nolan	367	" Trade , properly conducted , is good for a man 's constitution . I could have shown you , in my time , weavers past seventy , with all their faculties as sharp as a pen - knife , doing without spectacles . It 's the new system of trade that 's to blame : a country ca n't have too much trade if it 's properly managed . Plenty of sound Tories have made their fortune by trade . You 've heard of Calibut Co. everybody has heard of Calibut . Well , sir , I knew old Mr. Calibut as well as I know you . He was once a crony of mine in a city warehouse ; and now , I 'll answer for it , he has a larger rent roll than Lord Wyvern . Bless your soul ! his subscriptions to charities would make a fine income for a nobleman . And he 's as good a Tory as I am . And as for his town establishment why , how much butter do you think is consumed there annually ? "
95357	95436	95351	95351	he	367	" Why , gentlemen , not less than two thousand pounds of butter during the few months the family is in town ! Trade makes property , my good sir , and property is conservative , as they say now . Calibut 's son - in - law is Lord Fortinbras . He paid me a large debt on his marriage . It 's all one web , sir . The prosperity of the country is one web . "
95437	95442	95444	95444	Christian	374	" To be sure , "
95470	95497	95449	95449	his	374	" We ca n't do without nobility . Look at France . When they got rid of the old nobles they were obliged to make new . "
95499	95505	95507	95508	Mr. Nolan	367	" True , very true , "
95534	95661	95662	95663	Mr. Nolan	367	" It 's the French Revolution that has done us harm here . It was the same at the end of the last century , but the war kept it off Mr. Pitt saved us . I knew Mr. Pitt . I had a particular interview with him once . He joked me about getting the length of his foot . ' Mr. Nolan , ' said he , ' there are those on the other side of the water whose name begins with N. who would be glad to know what you know . ' I was recommended to send an account of that to the newspapers after his death , poor man ! but I 'm not fond of that kind of show myself . "
95688	95695	95697	95698	Mr. Wace	203	" No , no very right , "
95702	95808	95810	95811	Mr. Wace	203	" But you never said a truer word than that about property . If a man 's got a bit of property , a stake in the country , he 'll want to keep things square . Where Jack is n't safe , Tom 's in danger . But that 's what makes it such an uncommonly nasty thing that a man like Transome should take up with these Radicals . It 's my belief he does it only to get into Parliament ; he 'll turn round when he gets there . Come , Dibbs , there 's something to put you in spirits , "
95826	95878	95810	95811	Mr. Wace	203	" You 've got to vote for a Radical with one side of your mouth , and make a wry face with the other ; but he 'll turn round by - and - by . As Parson Jack says , he 's got the right sort of blood in him . "
95879	95891	95893	95893	Dibbs	377	" I do n't care two straws who I vote for , "
95897	95959	95893	95893	Dibbs	377	" I 'm not going to make a wry face . It stands to reason a man should vote for his landlord . My farm 's in good condition , and I 've got the best pasture on the estate . The rot 's never come nigh me . Let them grumble as are on the wrong side of the hedge . "
95960	95971	95973	95974	Mr. Sircome	284	" I wonder if Jermyn'll bring him in , though , "
95980	96015	95973	95974	Mr. Sircome	284	" He 's an uncommon fellow for carrying things through . I know he brought me through that suit about my weir ; it cost a pretty penny , but he brought me through . "
96016	96034	96036	96037	Mr. Wace	203	" It 's a bit of a pill for him , too , having to turn Radical , "
96039	96063	96036	96037	Mr. Wace	203	" They say he counted on making friends with Sir Maximus , by this young one coming home and joining with Mr. Philip . "
96064	96076	96078	96079	Mr. Sircome	284	" But I 'll bet a penny he brings Transome in , "
96081	96135	96078	96079	Mr. Sircome	284	" Folks say he has n't got many votes hereabout ; but toward Duffield , and all 187 there , where the Radicals are , everybody 's for him . Eh , Mr. Christian ? Come you 're at the fountain - head what do they say about it now at the Manor ? "
96199	96213	96215	96215	Christian	271	" They think it will be a hard run between Transome and Garstin , "
96217	96226	96215	96215	Christian	271	" It depends on Transome 's getting plumpers . "
96227	96239	96241	96242	Mr. Wace	203	" Well , I know I shall not split for Garstin , "
96244	96269	96241	96242	Mr. Wace	203	" It 's nonsense for Debarry 's voters to split for a Whig . A man 's either a Tory or not a Tory . "
96270	96282	96284	96286	Mr. Timothy Rose	373	" It seems reasonable there should be one of each side , "
96288	96319	96284	96286	Mr. Timothy Rose	373	" I do n't like showing favor either way . If one side ca n't lower the poor 's rates and take off the tithe , let the other try . "
96320	96330	96332	96333	Mr. Sircome	284	" But there 's this in it , Wace , "
96335	96401	96332	96333	Mr. Sircome	284	" I 'm not altogether against the Whigs . For they do n't want to go so far as the Radicals do , and when they find they 've slipped a bit too far they 'll hold on all the tighter . And the Whigs have got the upper hand now , and it 's no use fighting with the current . I run with the "
96420	96426	96405	96405	himself	284	" eh , Mr. Nolan ? "
96427	96442	96444	96445	Mr. Nolan	367	" There have been eminent Whigs , sir . Mr. Fox was a Whig , "
96447	96611	96444	96445	Mr. Nolan	367	" Mr. Fox was a great orator . He was very intimate with the Prince of Wales . I 've seen him , and the Duke of York too , go home by daylight with their hats crushed . Mr. Fox was a great leader of Opposition : Government requires an Opposition . The Whigs should always be in opposition , and the Tories on the ministerial side . That 's what the country used to like . ' The Whigs for salt and mustard , the Tories for meat , ' Mr. Gottlib , the banker , used to say to me . Mr. Gottlib was a worthy man . When there was a great run on Mr. Gottlib 's bank in ' 16 , I saw a gentleman come in with bags of gold , and say , ' Tell Mr. Gottlib there 's plenty more where that came from . ' It stopped the run , gentlemen it did indeed . "
96630	96660	96672	96673	the brewer	2974	" There now , you see , Wace it 's right there should be Whigs as well as Tories Pitt and Fox I 've always heard them go together . "
96661	96670	96672	96673	the brewer	2974	" Well , I do n't like Garstin , "
96675	96713	96672	96673	the brewer	2974	" I did n't like his conduct about the Canal Company . Of the two , I like Transome best . If a nag is to throw me , I say , let him have some blood . "
96714	96721	96723	96724	Mr. Salt	383	" As for blood , Wace , "
96747	96771	96723	96724	Mr. Salt	383	" ask my brother - in - law , Labron , a little about that . These Transomes are not the old blood . "
96772	96786	96788	96789	Mr. Wace	203	" Well , they 're the oldest that 's forthcoming , I suppose , "
96793	96813	96788	96789	Mr. Wace	203	" Unless you believe in mad old Tommy Trounsem . I wonder where that old poaching fellow is now . "
96814	96825	96827	96828	young Joyce	374	" I saw him half - drunk the other day , "
96830	96846	96827	96828	young Joyce	374	" He 'd got a flag - basket with handbills in it over his shoulder . "
96847	96856	96858	96859	Mr. Wace	203	" I thought the old fellow was dead , "
96861	96868	96869	96869	he	203	" Hey ! why , Jermyn , "
96884	96929	96869	96869	he	203	" you Radical ! how dare you show yourself in this Tory house ? Come , this is going a bit too far . We do n't mind Old Harry managing our law for us that 's his proper business from time immemorial ; but "
96930	96933	96935	96935	Jermyn	145	" But a "
96958	96970	96949	96949	his	145	" if he meddles with politics he must be a Tory . "
97059	97080	97082	97083	Mr. Wace	203	" We were talking about old Tommy Trounsem ; you remember him ? They say he 's turned up again , "
97085	97088	97090	97090	Jermyn	145	" Ah ? "
97094	97152	97090	97090	Jermyn	145	" But a Wace I 'm very busy to - day but I wanted to see you about that bit of land of yours at the corner of Pod 's End . I 've had a handsome offer for you I 'm not at liberty to say from whom but an offer that ought to tempt you . "
97153	97160	97162	97163	Mr. Wace	203	" It wo n't tempt me , "
97167	97190	97162	97163	Mr. Wace	203	" if I 've got a bit of land , I 'll keep it . It 's hard enough to get hereabouts . "
97192	97204	97206	97206	Jermyn	145	" Then I 'm to understand that you refuse all negotiation ? "
97251	97274	97240	97240	he	145	" Unless one of the confounded railways should come . But then I 'll stand out and make 'em bleed for it . "
97293	97303	97305	97305	Jermyn	145	" A Mr. Philip Debarry at the Manor now ? "
97324	97327	97329	97329	Christian	374	" No , "
97331	97340	97329	97329	Christian	374	" he is expected to - morrow morning . "
97341	97345	97346	97346	Jermyn	145	" Ah ! - "
97357	97379	97346	97346	Jermyn	145	" You are sufficiently in his confidence , I think , to carry a message to him with a small document ? "
97380	97390	97392	97392	Christian	374	" Mr. Debarry has often trusted me so far , "
97398	97416	97392	97392	Christian	374	" but if the business is yours , you can probably find some one you know better . "
97434	97439	97441	97441	Jermyn	145	" A true a , "
97448	97498	97441	97441	Jermyn	145	" if you decline . But I think , if you will do me the favor to step round to my residence on your way back , and learn the business , you will prefer carrying it yourself . At my residence , if you please not my office . "
97499	97505	97507	97507	Christian	374	" Oh , very well , "
97509	97516	97507	97507	Christian	374	" I shall be very happy . "
97545	97558	97560	97560	Jermyn	145	" Will it be five o'clock ? what hour shall we say ? "
97570	97578	97562	97562	Christian	374	" About five I can be there . "
97579	97583	97585	97585	Jermyn	145	" Very good , "
97591	97606	97627	97627	Jermyn	145	" Well a Wace a so you will hear nothing about Pod 's End ? "
97607	97610	97562	97562	Christian	374	" Not I. "
97611	97625	97627	97627	Jermyn	145	" A mere pocket - handkerchief , not enough to swear by - a "
97634	97641	97627	97627	Jermyn	145	" without a magnifying - glass . "
97643	97679	97562	97562	Christian	374	" Never mind . It 's mine into the bowels of the earth and up to the sky . I can build the Tower of Babel on it if I like eh , Mr. Nolan ? "
97680	97689	97691	97692	Mr. Nolan	367	" A bad investment , my good sir , "
97716	97726	97728	97728	Jermyn	145	" See now , how blind you Tories are , "
97732	97775	97728	97728	Jermyn	145	" if I had been your lawyer , I 'd have had you make another forty - shilling freeholder with that land , and all in time for this election . But a the verbum sapientibus comes a little too late now . "
97793	97824	97786	97787	Mr. Wace	203	" We 're not so badly off for votes as you are good sound votes , that 'll stand the Revising Barrister . Debarry at the top of the poll ! "
97950	98035	97945	97945	he	374	" These lawyers are the fellows for getting on in the world with the least expense of civility . With this cursed conjuring secret of theirs called Law , they think everybody is frightened at them . My Lord Jermyn seems to have his insolence as ready as his soft sawder . He 's as sleek as a rat , and has as vicious a tooth . I know the sort of vermin well enough . I 've helped to fatten one or two . "
98166	98170	98158	98159	the footman	3047	" Mr. Christian , "
98174	98184	98171	98171	Jermyn	173	" Good evening , Mr. Christian . Be seated , "
98195	98211	98171	98171	Jermyn	173	" Light the candles on the shelf , John , but leave the blinds alone . "
98285	98294	98304	98304	he	173	" A your name a is Henry Scaddon . "
98347	98439	98340	98340	Jermyn	173	" You were born on the sixteenth of December , 1782 , at Blackheath . Your father was a cloth - merchant in London : he died when you were barely of age , leaving an extensive business : before you were five - and - twenty you had run through the greater part of the property , and had compromised your safety by an attempt to defraud your creditors . Subsequently you forged a check on your father 's elder brother , who had intended to make you his heir . "
98455	98667	98673	98673	he	173	" In 1808 you found it expedient to leave this country in a military disguise , and were taken prisoner by the French . On the occasion of an exchange of prisoners you had the opportunity of returning to your own country , and to the bosom of your own family . You were generous enough to sacrifice that prospect in favor of a fellow - prisoner , of about your own age and figure , who had more pressing reasons than yourself for wishing to be on this side of the water . You exchanged dress , luggage , and names with him , and he passed to England instead of you as Henry Scaddon . Almost immediately afterward you escaped from your imprisonment , after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of names from being discovered ; and it was reported that you that is , you under the name of your fellow - prisoner were drowned in an open boat , trying to reach a Neapolitan vessel bound for Malta . Nevertheless I have to congratulate you on the falsehood of that report , and on the certainty that you are now , after the lapse of more than twenty years , seated here in perfect safety . "
98688	98738	98682	98682	Christian	271	" Well , sir , I 've heard much longer stories than that told quite as solemnly , when there was not a word of truth in them . Suppose I deny the very peg you hang your statement on . Suppose I say I am not Henry Scaddon . "
98739	98746	98748	98748	Jermyn	173	" A in that case a , "
98754	98828	98748	98748	Jermyn	173	" you would lose the advantage which a may attach to your possession of Henry Scaddon 's knowledge . And at the same time , if it were in the least a inconvenient to you that you should be recognized as Henry Scaddon , your denial would not prevent me from holding the knowledge and evidence which I possess on that point ; it would only prevent us from pursuing the present conversation . "
98829	98868	98682	98682	Christian	271	" Well , sir , suppose we admit , for the sake of the conversation , that your account of the matter is the true one : what advantage have you to offer the man named Henry Scaddon ? "
98869	98968	98748	98748	Jermyn	173	" The advantage a is problematical ; but it may be considerable . It might , in fact , release you from the necessity of acting as courier , or a valet , or whatever other office you may occupy which prevents you from being your own master . On the other hand , my acquaintance with your secret is not necessarily a disadvantage to you . To put the matter in a nutshell , I am not inclined a gratuitously to do you any harm , and I may be able to do you a considerable service . "
98969	98978	98980	98980	Christian	271	" Which you want me to earn somehow ? "
98982	98992	98980	98980	Christian	271	" You offer me a turn in a lottery ? "
98993	99091	98748	98748	Jermyn	173	" Precisely . The matter in question is of no earthly interest to you , except a as it may yield you a prize . We lawyers have to do with complicated questions , and a legal subtleties , which are never a fully known even to the parties immediately interested , still less to the witnesses . Shall we agree , then , that you continue to retain two - thirds of the name which you gained by exchange , and that you oblige me by answering certain questions as to the experience of Henry Scaddon ? "
99092	99099	98980	98980	Christian	271	" Very good . Go on . "
99100	99122	98748	98748	Jermyn	173	" What articles of property once belonging to your fellow - prisoner , Maurice Christian Bycliffe , do you still retain ? "
99124	99128	99130	99130	Christian	333	" This ring , "
99143	99275	99130	99130	Christian	333	" his watch , and the little matters that hung with it , and a case of papers . I got rid of a gold snuff - box once when I was hard up . The clothes are all gone , of course . We exchanged everything ; it was all done in a hurry . Bycliffe thought we should meet again in England before long , and he was mad to get there . But that was impossible I mean that we should meet soon after . I do n't know what 's become of him , else I would give him up his papers and the watch , and so on though , you know , it was I who did him the service , and he felt that . "
99276	99288	98980	98980	Christian	271	" You were at Vesoul together before being moved to Verdun ? "
99289	99292	99130	99130	Christian	333	" Yes . "
99293	99302	98980	98980	Christian	271	" What else do you know about Bycliffe ? "
99303	99310	99312	99312	Christian	333	" Oh , nothing very particular , "
99323	99398	99320	99320	his	333	" He 'd been in the Hanoverian army a high - spirited fellow , took nothing easily ; not over - strong in health . He made a fool of himself with marrying at Vesoul ; and there was the devil to pay with the girl 's relations ; and then , when the prisoners were ordered off , they had to part . Whether they ever got together again I do n't know . "
99399	99407	98980	98980	Christian	271	" Was the marriage all right then ? "
99408	99435	99320	99320	his	333	" Oh , all on the square civil marriage , church everything . Bycliffe was a fool a good - natured , proud , headstrong fellow . "
99436	99449	98980	98980	Christian	271	" How long did the marriage take place before you left Vesoul ? "
99450	99462	99320	99320	his	333	" About three months . I was witness to the marriage . "
99463	99473	98980	98980	Christian	271	" And you know no more about the wife ? "
99474	99539	99320	99320	his	333	" Not afterward . I knew her very well before pretty Annette Annette Ledru was her name . She was of a good family , and they had made up a fine match for her . But she was one of your meek little diablesses , who have a will of their own once in their lives the will to choose their own master . "
99540	99552	98980	98980	Christian	271	" Bycliffe was not open to you about his other affairs ? "
99553	99624	99320	99320	his	333	" Oh , no a fellow you would n't dare to ask a question of . People told him everything , but he told nothing in return . If Madame Annette ever found him again , she found her lord and master with a vengeance ; but she was a regular lapdog . However , her family shut her up made a prisoner of her to prevent her running away . "
99626	99718	99320	99320	his	333	" Ah good . Much of what you have been so obliging as to say is irrelevant to any possible purpose of mine , which , in fact , has only to do with a mouldy law - case that might be aired some day . You will doubtless , on your own account , maintain perfect silence on what has passed between us , and with that condition duly preserved a it is possible that a the lottery you have put into as you observe may turn up a prize . "
99719	99733	99735	99735	Christian	333	" This , then , is all the business you have with me ? "
99739	99767	99320	99320	his	333	" All . You will , of course , preserve carefully all the papers and other articles which have so many a recollections a attached to them ? "
99768	99822	99320	99320	his	333	" Oh , yes . If there 's any chance of Bycliffe turning up again , I shall be sorry to have parted with the snuff - box ; but I was hard - up at Naples . In fact , as you see , I was obliged at last to turn courier . "
99823	99840	99842	99842	Jermyn	173	" An exceedingly agreeable life for a man of some a accomplishments and a no income , "
99893	99920	99889	99889	he	333	" I think you 're too clever , Mr. Jermyn , not to perceive that I 'm not a man to be made a fool of . "
99921	99935	99937	99937	Jermyn	173	" Well a it may perhaps be a still better guarantee for you , "
99941	99953	99937	99937	Jermyn	173	" that I see no use in attempting that a metamorphosis . "
99954	99985	99889	99889	he	333	" The old gentleman , who ought never to have felt himself injured , is dead now , and I 'm not afraid of creditors after more than twenty years . "
99986	100026	99937	99937	Jermyn	173	" Certainly not ; a there may indeed be claims which ca n't assert themselves a legally , which yet are molesting to a man of some reputation . But you may perhaps be happily free from such fears . "
100047	100052	100037	100037	Christian	333	" Good - day , "
100459	100614	100455	100455	he	1426	" Now , Mr. Harold , I shall shut up this affair in a private drawer till you choose to take any extreme measures which will force me to bring it out . I have the matter entirely in my own power . No one but old Lyon knows about the girl 's birth . No one but Scaddon can clench the evidence about Bycliffe , and I 've got Scaddon under my thumb . No soul except myself and Johnson , who is a limb of myself , knows that there is one half - dead life which may presently leave the girl a new claim to the Bycliffe heirship . I shall learn through Methurst whether Batt Cowley knew , through Bycliffe , of this woman having come to England . I shall hold all the threads between my thumb and finger . I can use the evidence or I can nullify it .
100615	100654	100455	100455	he	1426	" And so , if Mr. Harold pushes me to extremity , and threatens me with chancery and ruin , I have an opposing threat , which will either save me or turn into a punishment for him . "
101279	101299	101263	101268	whose third affectionate and expensive daughter	3089	" Papa , papa , get ready for dinner ; do n't you remember that the Lukyns are coming ? "
101461	101577	101446	101447	Mrs. Holt	205	" as Lyddy herself ? Or , if she came home that way at twelve o'clock , Felix might be going out , she might meet him , and not be obliged to call . Or but it would be very much beneath her to take any steps of this sort . Her watch had been losing for the last two months why should it not go on losing a little longer ? She could think of no devices that were not so transparent as to be undignified . All the more undignified because Felix chose to live in a way that would prevent any one from classing him according to his education and mental refinement "
101584	101601	101446	101447	Mrs. Holt	205	" said Esther , inwardly , coloring , as if in answer to some contrary allegation , "
101613	101630	101446	101447	Mrs. Holt	205	" But she came to the conclusion that she could not possibly call at Mrs. Holt 's .
101720	101763	101713	101713	she	214	" It 's never you , Miss Lyon ! who 'd have thought of seeing you at this time ? Is the minister ill ? I thought he looked creechy . If you want help , I 'll put my bonnet on . "
101764	101782	101788	101788	Felix	134	" Do n't keep Miss Lyon at the door , mother ; ask her to come in , "
101799	101814	101816	101817	Mrs. Holt	205	" It 's my wish for her to come in , I 'm sure , "
101822	101882	101816	101817	Mrs. Holt	205	" but what is there for her to come in to ? a floor worse than any public . But step in , pray , if you 're so inclined . When I 've been forced to take my bit of carpet up , and have benches , I do n't see why I need mind nothing no more . "
101883	101901	101903	101903	Esther	214	" I only came to ask Mr. Holt if he would look at my watch for me , "
101915	101923	101925	101926	Mrs. Holt	205	" He 'll do that fast enough , "
101931	101942	101925	101926	Mrs. Holt	205	" that 's one of the things he will do . "
101943	101951	101953	101953	Felix	134	" Excuse my rising , Miss Lyon , "
101955	101964	101953	101953	Felix	134	" I 'm binding up Job 's finger . "
102121	102169	102116	102116	he	3095	" This is a hero , Miss Lyon . This is Job Tudge , a bold Briton whose finger hurts him , but who does n't mean to cry . Good - morning , boys . Do n't lose your time . Get out into the air . "
102206	102211	102194	102196	the other boys	3098	" Good - morning ! "
102212	102218	102220	102221	Mrs. Holt	205	" Did you ever see , "
102228	102285	102220	102221	Mrs. Holt	205	" how wonderful Felix is at that small work with his large fingers ? And that 's because he learned doctoring . It is n't for want of cleverness he looks like a poor man , Miss Lyon . I 've left off speaking , else I should say it 's a sin and a shame . "
102293	102296	102298	102298	Felix	134	" Mother , "
102320	102359	102298	102298	Felix	134	" you have an astonishing readiness in the Ciceronian antiphrasis , considering you have never studied oratory . There , Job thou patient man sit still if thou wilt ; and now we can look at Miss Lyon . "
102391	102400	102388	102388	he	3099	" You want me to doctor your watch ? "
102522	102539	102509	102509	her	214	" It loses . It is very troublesome . It has been losing a long while . "
102569	102585	102564	102564	he	3099	" You look distressed , Miss Lyon . I hope there is no trouble at home "
102599	102613	102590	102591	the minister	1433	" But I ought perhaps to beg your pardon for saying so much . "
102670	102699	102656	102656	she	214	" I wanted to tell you that I was not offended that I am not ungenerous I thought you might think but you have not thought of it . "
102832	102839	102815	102826	Suddenly little Job , who had his mental exercises on the occasion	3108	" She 's tut her finger ! "
102866	102889	102864	102864	she	214	" You see , Job , I am a naughty coward . I ca n't help crying when I 've hurt myself . "
102890	102895	102897	102897	Job	397	" Zoo soodn't kuy , "
102919	102925	102927	102927	Felix	134	" Job is like me , "
102929	102946	102947	102947	he	3109	" fonder of preaching than of practice . But let us look at this same watch , "
102956	103000	102947	102947	he	3109	" These little Geneva toys are cleverly constructed to go always a little wrong . But if you wind them up and set them regularly every night , you may know at least that it 's not noon when the hand points there . "
103019	103133	103012	103013	Mrs. Holt	205	" You 'll excuse my going away , I know , Miss Lyon . But there were the dumplings to see to , and what little I 've got left on my hands now I like to do well . Not but what I 've more cleaning to do than ever I had in my life before , as you may tell soon enough if you look at this floor . But when you 've been used to doing things , and they 've been taken away from you , it 's as if your hands had been cut off , and you felt the fingers as are of no use to you . "
103134	103143	103145	103145	Felix	134	" That 's a great image , mother , "
103159	103170	103145	103145	Felix	134	" I never heard you use such an image before . "
103171	103366	103367	103368	Mrs. Holt	205	" Yes , I know you 've always some fault to find with what your mother says . But if ever there was a woman could talk with the open Bible before her , and not be afraid , it 's me . I never did tell stories , and I never will though I know it 's done , Miss Lyon , and by church members too , when they have candles to sell , as I could bring you to the proof . But I never was one of 'em , let Felix say what he will about the printing on the tickets . His father believed it was gospel truth , and it 's presumptuous to say it was n't . For as for curing , how can anybody know ? There 's no physic'll cure without a blessing , and with a blessing I know I 've seen a mustard plaister work when there was no more smell nor strength in the mustard than so much flour . And reason 201 good for the mustard had lain in paper nobody knows how long so I 'll leave you to guess . "
103407	103416	103404	103404	Esther	214	" I think I had better go now , "
103470	103477	103478	103478	she	214	" Where does Job Tudge live ? "
103512	103518	103520	103520	Felix	134	" Job has two mansions , "
103522	103577	103520	103520	Felix	134	" He lives here chiefly ; but he has another home , where his grandfather , Mr. Tudge , the stone - breaker , lives . My mother is very good to Job , Miss Lyon . She has made him a little bed in a cupboard , and she gives him sweetened porridge . "
103647	103663	103665	103666	Mrs. Holt	205	" Well , why should n't I be motherly to the child , Miss Lyon ? "
103690	103929	103665	103666	Mrs. Holt	205	" I never was hard - hearted , and I never will be . It was Felix picked the child up and took to him , you may be sure , for there 's nobody else master where he is ; but I was n't going to beat the orphan child and abuse him because of that , and him as straight as an arrow when he 's stripped , and me so fond of children , and only had one of my own to live . I 'd three babies , Miss Lyon , but the blessed Lord only spared Felix , and him the masterfulest and brownest of 'em all . But I did my duty by him , and I said , he 'll have more schooling than his father , and he 'll grow up a doctor , and marry a woman with money to furnish as I was myself , spoons and everything and I shall have the grandchildren to look up to me , and be drove out in the gig sometimes , like old Mrs. Lukyn . And you see what 202 it 's all come to , Miss Lyon : here 's Felix made a common man of himself , and says he 'll never be married which is the most unreasonable thing , and him never easy but when he 's got the child on his lap , or when "
103930	103937	103938	103938	Felix	134	" Stop , stop , mother , "
103942	103999	103938	103938	Felix	134	" pray do n't use that limping argument again that a man should marry because he 's fond of children . That 's a reason for not marrying . A bachelor 's children are always young : they 're immortal children always lisping , waddling , helpless , and with a chance of turning out good . "
104000	104024	103665	103666	Mrs. Holt	205	" The Lord above may know what you mean ! And have n't other folks 's children a chance of turning out good ? "
104025	104042	104044	104044	Felix	134	" Oh , they grow out of it very fast . Here 's Job Tudge now , "
104062	104157	103665	103666	Mrs. Holt	205	" Job 's limbs will get lanky ; this little fist that looks like a puff - ball and can hide nothing bigger than a gooseberry , will get large and bony , and perhaps want to clutch more than its share ; these wide blue eyes that tell me more truth than Job knows , will narrow and narrow and try to hide truth that Job would be better without knowing ; this little negative nose will become long and self - asserting ; and this little tongue put out thy tongue , Job "
104175	104236	104158	104158	Job	397	" this tongue , hardly bigger than a rose - leaf , will get large and thick , wag out of season , do mischief , brag and ca nt for gain or vanity , and cut as cruelly , for all its clumsiness , as if it were a sharp - edged blade . Big Job will perhaps be naughty "
104275	104279	104281	104282	Mrs. Holt	205	" See here , "
104284	104307	104281	104282	Mrs. Holt	205	" you 're frightening the innocent child with such talk and it 's enough to frighten them that think themselves the safest . "
104308	104317	104319	104319	Felix	134	" Look here , Job , my man , "
104331	104355	104319	104319	Felix	134	" go to Miss Lyon , ask her to smile at you , and that will dry up your tears like the sunshine . "
104384	104413	104381	104381	she	214	" Tell Mr. Holt we do n't mean to be naughty , Job . He should believe in us more . But now I must really go home . "
104439	104539	104430	104430	she	205	" I 'm very glad it 's took your fancy to come here sometimes , Miss Lyon . I know you 're thought to hold your head high , but I speak of people as I find 'em . And I 'm sure anybody had need be humble that comes where there 's a floor like this for I 've put by my best tea - trays , they 're so out of all character I must look Above for comfort now ; but I do n't say I 'm not worthy to be called on for all that . "
104566	104574	104549	104549	he	3117	" Good - bye , Mr. Holt . "
104575	104595	104549	104549	he	3117	" Will Mr. Lyon like for me to sit with him an hour this evening , do you think ? "
104596	104607	104549	104549	he	3117	" Why not ? He always likes to see you . "
104608	104618	104549	104549	he	3117	" Then I will come . Good - bye . "
104619	104627	104629	104630	Mrs. Holt	205	" She 's a very straight figure , "
104632	104678	104629	104630	Mrs. Holt	205	" How she carries herself ! But I doubt there 's some truth in what our people say . If she wo n't look at young Muscat , it 's the better for him . He 'd need have a big fortune that marries her . "
104679	104686	104688	104688	Felix	134	" That 's true , mother , "
104737	104877	104734	104734	She	214	" I need not mind having shown so much anxiety about his opinion . He is too clear - sighted to mistake our mutual position ; he is quite above putting a false interpretation on what I have done . Besides , he had not thought of me at all I saw that plainly enough . Yet he was very kind . There is something greater and better in him than I had imagined . His behavior to - day to his mother and me too I should call it the highest gentlemanliness , only it seems in him to be something deeper . But he has chosen an intolerable life ; though I suppose , if I had a mind equal to his , and if he loved me very dearly , I should choose the same life . "
104886	104888	104881	104881	she	214	" if "
105333	105348	105350	105350	Felix	134	" I do n't see how he can fulfill it if the rector refuses , "
105363	105395	105397	105398	Mr. Lyon	208	" The rector is of a spirit that will not incur earthly impeachment , and he can not refuse what is necessary to his nephew 's honorable discharge of an obligation , "
105400	105444	105397	105398	Mr. Lyon	208	" My young friend , it is a case wherein the prearranged conditions tend by such a beautiful fitness to the issue I have sought , that I should have forever held myself a traitor to my charge had I neglected the indication . "
105449	105481	105482	105483	Henry IV	402	" I will not excuse you ; you shall not be excused ; excuses shall not be admitted ; there 's no excuse shall serve ; you shall not be excused . "
105739	105749	105751	105752	the rector	1106	" What makes you look so merry , Phil ? "
105762	105768	105770	105770	Philip	267	" Something that concerns you , "
105777	105806	105770	105770	Philip	267	" A clerical challenge . Here 's an opportunity for you to emulate the divines of the sixteenth century and have a theological duel . Read this letter . "
105807	105818	105820	105821	the rector	1106	" What answer have you sent the crazy little fellow ? "
105848	105860	105820	105821	the rector	1106	" Oh , I sent no answer . I awaited yours . "
105861	105864	105866	105867	the rector	1106	" Mine ! "
105877	105914	105866	105867	the rector	1106	" You do n't suppose I 'm going to hold a public debate with a schismatic of that sort ? I should have an infidel shoemaker next expecting me to answer blasphemies delivered in bad grammar . "
105915	105924	105926	105926	Philip	267	" But you see how he puts it , "
105965	105980	105951	105951	he	267	" I think if you refuse , I shall be obliged to offer myself . "
105981	106058	105866	105867	the rector	1106	" Nonsense ! Tell him he is himself acting a dishonorable part in interpreting your words as a pledge to do any preposterous thing that suits his fancy . Suppose he had asked you to give him land to build a chapel on ; doubtless that would have given him a ' lively satisfaction . ' A man who puts a non - natural , strained sense on a promise is no better than a robber . "
106059	106097	105951	105951	he	267	" But he has not asked for land . I dare say he thinks you wo n't object to his proposal . I confess there 's a simplicity and quaintness about the letter that rather pleases me . "
106098	106259	105866	105867	the rector	1106	" Let me tell you , Phil , he 's a crazy little firefly , that does a great deal of harm in my parish . He inflames the Dissenters ' minds on politics . There 's no end to the mischief done by these busy , prating men . They make the ignorant multitude the judges of the largest questions , both political and religious , till we shall soon have no institution left that is not on a level with the comprehension of a huckster or a drayman . There can be nothing more retrograde losing all the results of civilization , all the lessons of Providence letting the windlass run down after men have been turning at it painfully for generations . If the instructed are not to judge for the uninstructed , why , let us set Dick Stubbs to make our almanacs , and have a President of the Royal Society elected by universal suffrage . "
106336	106339	106341	106341	Philip	267	" True , "
106343	106400	106341	106341	Philip	267	" but in special cases we have to do with special conditions . You know I defend the casuists . And it may happen that , for the honor of the church in Treby , and a little also for my honor , circumstances may demand a concession even to some notions of a Dissenting preacher . "
106401	106476	106291	106291	Philip	267	" Not at all . I should be making a figure which my brother clergy might well take as an affront to themselves . The character of the Establishment has suffered enough already through the Evangelicals , with their extempore incoherence and their pipe - smoking piety . Look at Wimple , the man who is vicar of Shuttleton without his gown and 207 bands anybody would take him for a grocer in mourning . "
106477	106542	106341	106341	Philip	267	" Well , I shall cut a still worse figure , and so will you , in the Dissenting magazines and newspapers . It will go the round of the kingdom . There will be a paragraph headed , ' Tory Falsehood and Clerical Cowardice , ' or else , ' The Meanness of the Aristocracy and the Incompetence of the Beneficed Clergy . ' "
106543	106598	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" There would be a worse paragraph if I were to consent to the debate . Of course it would be said that I was beaten hollow , and , that now the question had been cleared up at Treba Magna , the Church had not a sound leg to stand on . Besides , "
106608	106712	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" it 's all very well for you to talk , Phil ; but this debating is not so easy when a man 's close upon sixty . What one writes or says must be something good and scholarly ; and , after all had been done , this little Lyon would buzz about one like a wasp , and cross - question and rejoin . Let me tell you , a plain truth may be so worried and mauled by fallacies as to get the worst of it . There 's no such thing as tiring a talking - machine like Lyon . "
106713	106719	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Then you absolutely refuse ? "
106720	106726	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Yes , I do . "
106727	106750	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" You remember that when I wrote my letter of thanks to Lyon you approved my offer to serve him if possible . "
106751	106779	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Certainly I remember it . But suppose he had asked you to vote for civil marriage , or to go and hear him preach every Sunday ? "
106780	106788	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" But he has not asked that . "
106789	106796	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Something as unreasonable , though . "
106797	106800	106802	106802	Philip	267	" Well , "
106817	106871	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" it is rather an unpleasant business for me . I really felt obliged to him . I think there 's a sort of worth in the man beyond his class . Whatever may be the reason of the case , I shall disappoint him instead of doing him the service I offered . "
106872	106886	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Well , that 's a misfortune ; we ca n't help it . "
106887	106942	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" The worst of it is , I should be insulting him to say , ' I will do anything else , but not just this that you want . ' He evidently feels himself in company with Luther and Zwingle and Calvin , and considers our letters part of the history of Protestantism . "
106943	106990	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" Yes , yes . I know it 's rather an unpleasant thing , Phil . You are aware that I would have done anything in reason to prevent you from becoming 208 unpopular here . I consider your character a possession to all of us . "
106991	107005	106599	106600	the rector	1106	" I think I must call on him forthwith and explain and apologize . "
107006	107018	107020	107021	the rector	1106	" No , sit still ; I 've thought of something , "
107030	107142	107020	107021	the rector	1106	" I 've just seen Sherlock coming in . He is to lunch with me to - day . It would do no harm for him to hold the debate a curate and a young man he 'll gain by it ; and it would release you from any awkwardness , Phil . Sherlock is not going to stay here long , you know ; he 'll soon have his title . I 'll put the thing to him . He wo n't object if I wish it . It 's a capital idea . It will do Sherlock good . He 's a clever fellow , but he wants confidence . "
107169	107179	107181	107182	the rector	1106	" Sherlock , you have come in most opportunely , "
107184	107266	107181	107182	the rector	1106	" A case has turned up in the parish in which you can be of eminent use . I know that is what you have desired ever since you have been with me . But I 'm about so much myself that there really has not been sphere enough for you . You are a studious man , I know ; I dare say you have all the necessary matter prepared at your finger - ends , if not on paper . "
107336	107346	107347	107348	the rector	1106	" You 'll oblige me very much , Sherlock , "
107351	107379	107347	107348	the rector	1106	" by going into this thing zealously . Can you guess what time you will require ? because it will rest with us to fix the day . "
107380	107401	107527	107527	his	1106	" I should be rejoiced to oblige you , Mr. Debarry , but I really think I am not competent to "
107402	107514	107347	107348	the rector	1106	" That 's your modesty , Sherlock . Do n't let me hear any more of that . I know Filmore of Corpus said you might be a first - rate man if your diffidence did n't do you injustice . And you can refer anything to me , you know . Come , you will set about the thing at once . But , Phil , you must tell the preacher to send a scheme of the debate all the different heads and he must agree to keep rigidly within the scheme . There , sit down at my desk and write the letter now ; Thomas shall carry it . "
107539	107541	107527	107527	his	1106	" indications "
107547	107728	107523	107524	the rector	1106	" But you can begin at once preparing a good , cogent , clear statement , and considering the probable points of assault . You can look into Jewel , Hall , Hooker , Whitgift , and the rest : you 'll find them all here . My library wants nothing in English divinity . Sketch the lower ground taken by Usher and those men , but bring all your force to bear on marking out the true High - Church doctrine . Expose the wretched cavils of the Noncomformists , and the noisy futility that belongs to schismatics generally . I will give you a telling passage from Burke on the Dissenters , and some good quotations which I brought together in two sermons of my own on the Position of the English Church in Christendom . How long do you think it will take you to bring your thoughts together ? You can throw them afterward into the form of an essay ; we 'll have the thing printed ; it will do you good with the Bishop . "
107884	107896	107863	107864	Mr. Sherlock	408	" I think I could hardly be ready under a fortnight . "
107897	107926	107927	107928	The rector	1106	" Very good . Just write that , Phil , and tell him to fix the precise day and place . And then we 'll go to lunch . "
108253	108259	108248	108248	his	208	" he glorified himself herein ; "
108377	108434	108370	108371	the rector	1106	" I think he 'll do . I 've supplied him well with references . I advise him to read only , and decline everything else as out of order . Lyon will speak to a point , and then Sherlock will read : it will be all the more telling . It will give variety . "
108845	108852	108858	108858	listeners	2623	" going to a better place . "
109261	109276	109278	109279	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" What a very nice - looking young woman your minister 's daughter is ? "
109302	109307	109278	109279	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" quite the lady . "
109308	109316	109318	109319	Mrs. Muscat	249	" Rather too much so , considering , "
109321	109409	109318	109319	Mrs. Muscat	249	" She 's thought proud , and that is not pretty in a girl , even if there was anything to back it up . But now she seems to be encouraging that young Holt , who scoffs at everything , as you may judge by his appearance . She has despised his betters before now ; but I leave you to judge whether a young man who has taken to low ways of getting a living can pay for fine cambric handkerchiefs and light kid gloves . "
109449	109454	109456	109457	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" Dear , dear , "
109459	109544	109456	109457	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" What ! that is young Holt leaning forward now without a cravat ? I 've never seen him before to notice him , but I 've heard Tiliot talking about him . They say he 's a dangerous character , and goes stirring up the workingmen at Sproxton . And well , to be sure , such great eyes and such a great head of hair it is enough to frighten one . What can she see in him ? Quite below her . "
109546	109555	109557	109558	Mrs. Muscat	249	" Yes , and brought up a governess , "
109560	109605	109557	109558	Mrs. Muscat	249	" you 'd have thought she 'd knowed better how to choose . But the minister has let her get the upper hand sadly too much . It 's a pity in a man of God . I do n't deny he 's that . "
109606	109613	109615	109616	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" Well , I am sorry , "
109618	109634	109615	109616	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" for I meant her to give my girls lessons when they came from school . "
109667	109675	109677	109678	Mr. Wace	203	" It 's time he came now , "
109692	109785	109677	109678	Mr. Wace	203	" This debating is a new - fangled sort of thing ; but the rector would never have given in to it if there had n't been good reasons . Nolan said he would n't come . He says this debating is an atheistical sort of thing ; the Atheists are very fond of it . Theirs is a bad book to take a leaf out of . However , we shall hear nothing but what 's good from Mr. Sherlock . He preaches a capital sermon for such a young man . "
109786	109805	109807	109808	Mr. Pendrell	417	" Well , it was our duty to support him not to leave him alone among the Dissenters , "
109810	109841	109807	109808	Mr. Pendrell	417	" You see everybody has n't felt that . Labron might have shown himself , if not Lukyn . I could have alleged business myself if I had thought proper . "
109842	109850	109852	109853	Mr. Wace	203	" Here he comes , I think , "
109872	109888	109852	109853	Mr. Wace	203	" By George ! it 's Mr. Debarry . Come now , this is handsome . "
110024	110030	110032	110032	Philip	267	" With all my heart , "
110034	110044	110032	110032	Philip	267	" But Mr. Sherlock has not arrived , apparently ? "
110046	110052	110054	110055	Mr. Lyon	208	" He tarries somewhat unduly , "
110057	110087	110054	110055	Mr. Lyon	208	" Nevertheless there may be a reason of which we know not . Shall I collect the thoughts of the assembly by a brief introductory address in the interval ? "
110088	110095	110097	110098	Mr. Wace	203	" No , no , no , "
110110	110124	110097	110098	Mr. Wace	203	" Mr. Sherlock is sure to be here in a minute or two . "
110125	110128	110130	110131	Philip Debarry	267	" Christian , "
110139	110197	110130	110131	Philip Debarry	267	" just be so good but stay , I 'll go myself . Excuse me , gentlemen : I 'll drive round to Mr. Sherlock 's lodgings . He may be under a little mistake as to the time . Studious men are sometimes rather absent - minded . You need n't come with me , Christian . "
110266	110268	110300	110301	a racer	3237	" deliverance "
110426	110432	110434	110434	Felix	134	" Your father is uneasy , "
110438	110492	110520	110521	Mr. Lyon	208	" Yes ; and now , I think , he is feeling for his spectacles . I hope he has not left them at home : he will not be able to see anything two yards before him without them ; and it makes him so unconscious of what people expect or want . "
110493	110505	110507	110507	Felix	134	" I 'll go and ask him whether he has them , "
110538	110555	110557	110557	Felix	134	" Miss Lyon is afraid that you are at a loss for your spectacles , sir , "
110560	110566	110568	110569	Mr. Lyon	208	" My dear young friend , "
110594	110785	110572	110572	his	208	" it is a very glorious truth , albeit made somewhat painful to me by the circumstances of the present moment , that as a counterpoise to the brevity of our mortal life wherein , as I apprehend , our powers are being trained not only for the transmission of an improved heritage , as I have heard you insist , but also for our own entrance into a higher initiation in the Divine scheme it is , I say , a very glorious truth , that even in what are called the waste minutes of our time , like those of expectation , the soul may soar and range , as in some of our dreams which are brief as a broken rainbow in duration , yet seem to comprise a long history of terror or joy . And again , each moment may be a beginning of a new spiritual energy ; and our pulse would doubtless be a coarse and clumsy notation of the passage from that which was not to that which is , even in the finer processes of the material world and how much more "
110886	110912	110877	110878	her father	1520	" Pray see whether you have forgotten your spectacles , father . If so , I will go home at once and look for them . "
110931	110946	110948	110948	Christian	333	" How is it that Miss Jermyn is so friendly with the Dissenting parson ? "
110963	110972	110950	110950	Quorlen	418	" Those grand Jermyns are not Dissenters surely ? "
110973	110978	111016	111016	Christian	333	" What Miss Jermyn ? "
110979	110995	110950	110950	Quorlen	418	" Why do n't you see ? that fine girl who is talking to him . "
110996	111010	111016	111016	Christian	333	" Miss Jermyn ! Why , that 's the little parson 's daughter . "
111011	111015	111016	111016	Christian	333	" His daughter ! "
111031	111036	111016	111016	Christian	333	" the rusty old ranter "
111056	111068	111070	111072	the little man	1497	" ' Tis a grievous fault in me , my dear , "
111076	111086	111070	111072	the little man	1497	" I 216 become thereby sadly burdensome to you . "
111087	111094	111096	111096	Esther	214	" I will go at once , "
111169	111315	111317	111317	Philip	267	" I am sorry to have to tell you , ladies and gentlemen , that doubtless owing to some accidental cause which I trust will soon be explained as nothing serious Mr. Sherlock is absent from his residence and is not to be found . He went out early , his landlady informs me , to refresh himself by a walk on this agreeable morning , as is his habit , she tells me , when he has been kept up late by study ; and he has not returned . Do not let us be too anxious . I shall cause enquiry to be made in the direction of his walk . It is easy to imagine many accidents , not of a grave character , by which he might nevertheless be absolutely detained against his will . Under these circumstances , Mr. Lyon , "
111324	111334	111317	111317	Philip	267	" I presume that the debate must be adjourned . "
111335	111341	111343	111344	Mr. Lyon	208	" The debate , doubtless , "
111384	111389	111391	111392	Mrs. Tiliot	415	" Good gracious me ! "
111402	111420	111395	111395	she	415	" I hope the poor young man has n't fallen into the river or broken his leg . "
111466	111475	111486	111486	his	3261	" He 's turned tail , sure enough , "
111544	111552	111554	111555	Philip Debarry	267	" I regret sincerely , Mr. Lyon , "
111563	111596	111554	111555	Philip Debarry	267	" that I must say good - morning to you , with the sense that I have not been able at present to contribute to your 217 satisfaction as I had wished . "
111597	111610	111612	111613	Mr. Lyon	208	" Speak not of it in the way of apology , sir , "
111621	111676	111612	111613	Mr. Lyon	208	" I doubt not that you yourself have acted in good faith . Nor will I open any door of egress to constructions such as anger often deems ingenious , but which the disclosure of the simple truth may expose as erroneous and uncharitable fabrications . I wish you good - morning , sir . "
111922	111930	111931	111931	he	208	" It seems to me , sirs , "
111940	112036	111931	111931	he	208	" that Mr. Lyon has hitherto had the hard part of the business , while you of his congregation have had the easy one . Punish the Church clergy , if you like they can take care of themselves . But do n't punish your own minister . It 's no business of mine , perhaps , except so far as fair - play is everybody 's business ; but it seems to me the time to ask Mr. Lyon to take a little rest , instead of setting on him like so many wasps . "
112115	112120	112121	112121	he	208	" But regarding personalities , "
112124	112225	112121	112121	he	208	" I have not the same clear showing . For , say that this young man was pusillanimous I were but ill - provided with arguments if I took my stand even for a moment on so poor an irrelevancy as that because one curate is ill furnished therefore Episcopacy is false . If I held up any one to just obloquy , it would be the well - designated Incumbent of this parish , who , calling himself one of the Church militant , sends a young and weak - kneed substitute to take his place in the fight . "
112396	112475	112385	112385	He	1106	" ; but he was convinced that for his own part he had taken the course which under the circumstances was the least compromising to the Church . Sir Maximus , however , observed to his son and brother that he had been right and they had been wrong as to the danger of vague , enormous expressions of gratitude to a Dissenting preacher , and on any differences of opinion seldom failed to remind them of that precedent .
113137	113168	113169	113169	Christian	333	" Begad , if the old parson had fancied the original father was come to life again , it was enough to frighten him a little . Slow and steady , "
113174	113252	113169	113169	Christian	333	" I 'll get some talk with the old man again . He 's safe enough : one can handle him without cutting one 's self . I 'll tell him I knew Bycliffe , and was his fellow - prisoner . I 'll worm out the truth about this daughter . Could pretty Annette have married again , and married this little scare - crow ? There 's no knowing what a woman will not do . "
113508	113528	113490	113491	the minister	1433	" If it is business , sir , you would perhaps do better to address yourself to Mr. Jermyn . "
113565	113572	113573	113573	he	333	" On the contrary , sir , "
113576	113599	113573	113573	he	333	" it may be of the utmost importance to you that what passes between us should not be known to Mr. Jermyn . "
113861	113872	113874	113874	Christian	333	" May I ask if you knew my friend Bycliffe ? "
113882	113892	114038	114039	Mr. Lyon	208	" No , sir ; I never saw him . "
113893	113936	114038	114039	Mr. Lyon	208	" Ah ! well you have seen a very striking likeness of him . It 's wonderful unaccountable ; but when I saw Miss Lyon at the Free School the other day , I could have sworn she was Bycliffe 's daughter . "
113937	113940	113942	113943	Mr. Lyon	208	" Sir ! "
113962	114003	113946	113946	his	208	" these subjects touch me with too sharp a point for you to be justified in thrusting them on me out of mere levity . Is there any good you seek or any injury you fear in relation to them ? "
114004	114037	114038	114039	Mr. Lyon	208	" Precisely , sir . We shall come to an understanding . Suppose I believed that the young lady who goes by the name of Miss Lyon was the daughter of Bycliffe ? "
114045	114071	114038	114039	Mr. Lyon	208	" And suppose I had reason to suspect that there would be some great advantage for her if the law knew who was her father ? "
114073	114076	114078	114079	Mr. Lyon	208	" Sir ! "
114087	114148	114078	114079	Mr. Lyon	208	" I would not conceal it . She believes herself to be my daughter . But I will bear all things rather than deprive her of a right . Nevertheless I appeal to the pity of any fellow - man , not to thrust himself between her and me , but to let me disclose the truth to her myself . "
114149	114155	114157	114157	Christian	333	" All in good time , "
114159	114174	114157	114157	Christian	333	" We must do nothing rash . Then Miss Lyon is Annette 's child ? "
114237	114260	114232	114232	he	1433	" It is true , sir . Her mother became my wife . Proceed with any statement which may concern my duty . "
114261	114380	114232	114232	he	1433	" I have no more to say than this : if there 's a prize that the law might hand over to Bycliffe 's daughter , I am much mistaken if there is n't a lawyer who 'll take precious good care to keep the law hoodwinked . And that lawyer is Mat Jermyn . Why , my good sir , if you 've been taking Jermyn into your confidence , you 've been setting the fox to keep off the weasel . It strikes me that when you were made a little anxious about those articles of poor Bycliffe 's , you put Jermyn on making enquiries of me . Eh ? I think I am right ? "
114381	114388	114232	114232	he	1433	" I do not deny it . "
114389	114504	114232	114232	he	1433	" Ah ! it was very well you did , for by that means I 've found that he 's got hold of some secrets about Bycliffe which he means to stifle . Now , sir , if you desire any justice for your daughter step - daughter , I should say do n't so much as wink to yourself before Jermyn ; and if you 've got any papers or things of that sort that may come in evidence , as these confounded rascals the lawyers call it , clutch them tight , for if they get into Jermyn 's hands they may soon fly up the chimney . Have I said enough ? "
114505	114558	114232	114232	he	1433	" I had not purposed any further communication with Mr. Jermyn , sir ; indeed , I have nothing further to communicate . Except that one fact concerning my daughter 's birth , which I have erred in concealing from her , I neither seek disclosures nor do I tremble before them . "
114559	114586	114232	114232	he	1433	" Then I have your word that you will be silent about this conversation between us ? It is for your daughter 's interest , mind . "
114587	114595	114597	114598	Mr. Lyon	208	" Sir , I shall be silent , "
114604	114607	114608	114608	he	208	" Unless , "
114629	114667	114608	114608	he	208	" unless I were called upon by some tribunal to declare the whole truth in this relation ; in which case I should submit myself to that authority of investigation which is a requisite of social order . "
114771	114782	114783	114783	he	208	" I will not wait for the urgency of necessity , "
114789	114822	114783	114783	he	208	" I will tell the child without compulsion . And then I shall fear nothing . And an unwonted spirit of tenderness has filled her of late . She will forgive me . "
114940	115016	114938	114938	Esther	214	" To - day is a holiday , father . My pupils are all going to Duffield to see the wild beasts . What have you got to do to - day ? Come , you are eating no breakfast . Oh , Lyddy , Lyddy , the eggs are hard again . I wish you would not read Alleyne 's ' Alarm ' before breakfast ; it makes you cry and forget the eggs . "
115017	115039	115041	115041	Lyddy	212	" They are hard , and that 's the truth ; but there 's hearts as are harder , Miss Esther , "
115043	115048	115050	115050	Esther	214	" I think not , "
115052	115075	115050	115050	Esther	214	" This is leathery enough for the heart of the most obdurate Jew . Pray give it little Zachary for a football . "
115077	115099	114938	114938	Esther	214	" Dear , dear , do n't you be so light , miss . We may all be dead before night . "
115100	115111	115113	115114	Mr. Lyon	208	" You speak out of season , my good Lyddy , "
115118	115124	115113	115114	Mr. Lyon	208	" depart into the kitchen . "
115125	115138	115140	115140	Esther	214	" What have you got to do to - day , father ? "
115142	115148	115140	115140	Esther	214	" I have a holiday . "
115163	115198	115149	115150	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have something of great moment to do , my dear ; and since you are not otherwise demanded , I will ask you to come and sit with me up - stairs . "
115581	115618	115571	115571	he	1520	" This is a late retrieval of a long error , Esther . I make not excuses for myself , for we ought to strive that our affections be rooted in 225 the truth . Nevertheless you "
115684	115704	115668	115668	her	214	" Father , father ! forgive me if I have not loved you enough . I will I will ! "
115760	115781	115752	115753	the minister	1433	" Surely the work of grace is begun in her surely here is a heart that the Lord hath touched . "
115834	115869	115828	115828	she	214	" Then you lived like a workingman , father ; you were very , very poor . Yet my mother had been used to luxury , She was well born she was a lady ? "
115870	115889	115828	115828	she	214	" It is true , my dear ; it was a poor life that I could give her . "
115997	116008	116010	116010	Esther	214	" But that must be the best life , father , "
116043	116051	116025	116025	her	214	" That must be the best life . "
116052	116060	116119	116120	her father	1520	" What life , my dear child ? "
116061	116091	116025	116025	her	214	" Why , that where one bears and does everything because of some great and strong feeling so that this and that in one 's circumstances do n't signify . "
116093	116113	116025	116025	her	214	" Yea , verily ; but the feeling that should be thus supreme is devotedness to the Divine Will . "
116150	116161	116140	116140	She	214	" Mamma did not speak much of my first father ? "
116162	116227	116140	116140	She	214	" Not much , dear . She said he was beautiful to the eye , and good and generous ; and that his family was of those who had been long privileged among their fellows . But now I will deliver to you the letters , which , together with the ring and locket , are the only visible memorials she retained of him . "
116241	116286	116228	116229	Mr. Lyon	208	" Take them , and examine them in privacy , my dear . And that I may no more err by concealment , I will tell you some late occurrences that bear on these memorials , though to my present apprehension doubtfully and confusedly . "
116358	116369	116370	116371	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have little confidence in this man 's allegations , "
116374	116462	116370	116371	Mr. Lyon	208	" I confess his presence and speech are to me as the jarring of metal . He bears the stamp of one who has never conceived aught of more sanctity than the lust of the eye and the pride of life . He hints at some possible inheritance for you , and denounces mysteriously the devices of Mr. Jermyn . All this may or may not have a true foundation . But it is not my part to move in this matter save on a clear showing . "
116463	116469	116471	116471	Esther	214	" Certainly not , father , "
116834	116854	116830	116830	Lyddy	212	" Miss , you look sadly ; if you ca n't take a walk , go and lie down . "
116995	117023	116988	116988	Lyddy	212	" Here 's Mr. Holt , Miss , wants to know if you 'll give him leave to come in . I told him you was sadly . "
117024	117037	116988	116988	Lyddy	212	" Oh , yes , Lyddy , beg him to come in . "
117038	117045	117047	117047	Felix	134	" I should not have persevered , "
117054	117069	117070	117070	he	3383	" only I know Lyddy 's dismal way . But you do look ill , "
117086	117119	117075	117075	he	3383	" Or rather for that 's a false way of putting it you look as if you had been very much distressed . Do you mind about my taking notice of it ? "
117145	117202	117121	117121	He	3383	" You are quite right . I am not at all ill . But I have been very much agitated this morning . My father has been telling me things I never heard before about my mother , and giving me things that belonged to her . She died when I was a very little creature . "
117203	117228	117275	117275	she	214	" Then it is no new pain or trouble for you and Mr. Lyon ? I could not help being anxious to know that . "
117240	117273	117229	117229	Esther	214	" I hardly know whether it is pain , or something better than pleasure . It has made me see things I was blind to before depths in my father 's nature . "
117291	117299	117300	117300	he	3386	" It is such a beautiful day , "
117303	117329	117300	117300	he	3386	" it would do you good to go into the air . Let me take you along the river toward Little Treby , will you ? "
117330	117338	117340	117340	Esther	214	" I will put my bonnet on , "
117548	117550	117580	117580	women	673	" public "
117629	117634	117636	117636	Felix	134	" Here we are ! "
117660	117684	117636	117636	Felix	134	" I 229 think this is delicious . I never feel less unhappy than in these late autumn afternoons when they are sunny . "
117685	117692	117694	117694	Esther	214	" Less unhappy ! There now ! "
117706	117767	117694	117694	Esther	214	" I have caught you in self - contradiction . I have heard you quite furious against puling , melancholy people . If I had said what you have just said , you would have given me a long lecture , and told me to go home and interest myself in the reason of the rule - of - three . "
117768	117772	117774	117774	Felix	134	" Very likely , "
117797	117861	117694	117694	Esther	214	" But I do n't think myself a fine fellow because I 'm melancholy . I do n't measure my force by the negations in me , and think my soul must be a mighty one because it is more given to idle suffering than to beneficent activity . That 's what your favorite gentlemen do , of the Byronic - bilious style . "
117862	117874	117694	117694	Esther	214	" I do n't admit that those are my favorite gentlemen . "
117875	117925	117694	117694	Esther	214	" I 've heard you defend them gentlemen like your Rťnťs , who have no particular talent for the finite , but a general sense that the infinite is the right thing for them . They might as well boast of nausea as a proof of a strong inside . "
117926	117954	117694	117694	Esther	214	" Stop , stop ! You run on in that way to get out of my reach . I convicted you of confessing that you are melancholy . "
117955	117958	117960	117960	Felix	134	" Yes , "
117974	118124	117960	117960	Felix	134	" as I could confess to a great many other things I 'm not proud of . The fact is , there are not many easy lots to be drawn in the world at present ; and such as they are I am not envious of them . I do n't say life is not worth having to a man who has some sparks of sense and feeling and bravery in him . And the finest fellow of all would be the one who could be glad to have lived because the world was chiefly miserable , and his life had come to help some one who needed it . He would be the man who had the most powers and the fewest selfish wants . But I 'm not up to the level of what I see to be best . I 'm often a hungry discontented fellow . "
118125	118136	118138	118138	Esther	214	" Why have you made your life so hard then ? "
118148	118164	118138	118138	Esther	214	" It seems to me you have tried to find just the most difficult task . "
118165	118170	118172	118172	Felix	134	" Not at all , "
118178	118216	118218	118219	230 Felix	134	" My course was a very simple one . It was pointed out to me by conditions that I saw as clearly as I see the bars of this stile . It 's a difficult stile too , "
118224	118238	118218	118219	230 Felix	134	" Shall I help you , or will you be left to yourself ? "
118239	118249	118138	118138	Esther	214	" I can do without help , thank you . "
118250	118256	118258	118258	Felix	134	" It was simple enough , "
118265	118318	118258	118258	Felix	134	" If I meant to put a stop to the sale of those drugs , I must keep my mother , and of course at her age she would not leave the place she had been used to . And I had made up my mind against what they call genteel business . "
118319	118359	118138	118138	Esther	214	" But suppose every one did as you do ? Please to forgive me for saying so ; but I can not see why you could not have lived as honorably with some employment that presupposes education and refinement . "
118360	118372	118374	118374	Felix	134	" Because you ca n't see my history or my nature , "
118378	118508	118374	118374	Felix	134	" I have to determine for myself , and not for other men . I do n't blame them , or think I am better than they ; their circumstances are different . I would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden of the world ; but I do choose to withdraw myself from the push and the scramble for money and position . Any man is at liberty to call me a fool , and say that mankind are benefited by the push and the scramble in the long - run . But I care for the people who live now and will not be living when the long - run comes . As it is , I prefer going shares with the unlucky . "
118567	118583	118585	118585	Felix	134	" See how beautiful those stooping birch - stems are with the light on them ! "
118587	118610	118585	118585	Felix	134	" Here is an old felled trunk they have not thought worth carrying away . Shall we sit down a little while ? "
118611	118631	118632	118632	Esther	214	" Yes ; the mossy ground with the dry leaves sprinkled over it is delightful to one 's feet . "
118674	118684	118685	118685	she	214	" I wish I felt more as you do , "
118705	118728	118685	118685	she	214	" I ca n't help caring very much what happens to me . And you seem to care so little about yourself . "
118729	118735	118737	118737	Felix	134	" You are thoroughly mistaken , "
118739	119002	118737	118737	Felix	134	" It is just because I 'm a very ambitious fellow , with very hungry passions , wanting a great deal to satisfy me , that I have chosen to give up what people call worldly 231 good . At least that has been one determining reason . It all depends on what a man gets into his consciousness what life thrusts into his mind , so that it becomes present to him as remorse is present to the guilty , or a mechanical problem to an inventive genius . There are two things I 've got present in that way : one of them is the picture of what I should hate to be . I 'm determined never to go about making my face simpering or solemn , and telling professional lies for profit ; or to get tangled in affairs where I must wink at dishonesty and pocket the proceeds , and justify that knavery as part of a system that I ca n't alter . If I once went into that sort of struggle for success I should want to win I should defend the wrong that I had once identified myself with . I should become everything that I see now beforehand to be detestable . And what 's more , I should do this , as men are doing it every day , for a ridiculously small prize perhaps for none at all perhaps for the sake of two parlors , a rank eligible for the churchwardenship , a discontented wife , and several unhopeful children . "
119028	119042	119044	119044	Felix	134	" The other thing that 's got into my mind like a splinter , "
119050	119122	119044	119044	Felix	134	" is the life of the miserable the spawning life of vice and hunger . I 'll never be one of the sleek dogs . The old Catholics are right , with their higher rule and their lower . Some are called to subject themselves to a harder discipline , and renounce things voluntarily which are lawful for others . It is the old word ' necessity ' is laid upon me .
119123	119136	119235	119235	Felix	134	" It seems to me you are stricter than my father is . "
119137	119188	119044	119044	Felix	134	" No ; I quarrel with no delight that is not base or cruel , but one must sometimes accommodate one 's self to a small share . That is the lot of the majority . I would wish the minority joy , only they do n't want my wishes . "
119391	119397	119378	119378	he	3408	" You are very beautiful . "
119485	119489	119490	119490	he	3408	" I wonder , "
119499	119551	119490	119490	he	3408	" whether the subtle measuring of forces will ever come to measuring the force there would be in one beautiful woman whose mind was as noble as her face was beautiful who made a man 's passion for her rush in one current with all the great aims of his life . "
119583	119614	119569	119569	She	214	" It is difficult for a woman ever to try to be anything good when she is not believed in when it is always supposed that she must be contemptible . "
119615	119620	119640	119640	he	3408	" No , dear Esther "
119661	119677	119643	119643	he	3408	" You do n't believe that I think you contemptible . When I first saw you "
119678	119685	119687	119687	Esther	214	" I know , I know , "
119698	119778	119687	119687	Esther	214	" You mean you did think me contemptible then . But it was very narrow of you to judge me in that way , when my life had been so different from yours . I have great faults . I know I am selfish , and think too much of my own small tastes and too little of what affects others . But I am not stupid . I am not unfeeling . I can see what is better . "
119779	119794	119796	119796	Felix	134	" But I have not done you injustice since I knew more of you , "
119800	119806	119808	119808	Esther	214	" Yes , you have , "
119819	119844	119808	119808	Esther	214	" You talk to me like an angry pedagogue . Were you always wise ? Remember the time when you were foolish or naughty . "
119846	119853	119855	119855	Felix	134	" That is not far off , "
119903	119913	119915	119915	Esther	214	" Shall we get up and walk back now ? "
119922	119925	119927	119927	Felix	134	" No , "
119931	119950	119927	119927	Felix	134	" Do n't move yet . I dare say we shall never walk together or sit here again . "
119951	119955	119915	119915	Esther	214	" Why not ? "
119956	119992	119927	119927	Felix	134	" Because I am a man who am warned by visions . Those old stories of visions and dreams guiding men have their truth ; we are saved by making the future present to ourselves . "
119993	120003	120005	120005	Esther	214	" I wish I could get visions , then , "
120026	120033	120035	120035	Felix	134	" That is what I want , "
120043	120205	120035	120035	Felix	134	" Do n't turn your head . Do look at me , and then I shall know if I may go on speaking . I do believe in you ; but I want you to have such a vision of the future that you may never lose your best self . Some charm or other may be flung about you some of your attar - of - rose fascinations and nothing but a good strong terrible vision will save you . And if it did save you , you might be that woman I was thinking of a little while ago when I looked at your face : the woman whose beauty makes a great task easier to men instead of turning them away from it . I am not likely to see such fine issues ; but they may come where a woman 's spirit is finely touched . I should like to be sure they would come to you . "
120206	120219	120221	120221	Esther	214	" Why are you not likely to know what becomes of me ? "
120233	120247	120221	120221	Esther	214	" Why should you not always be my father 's friend and mine ? "
120248	120265	120267	120267	Felix	134	" Oh , I shall go away as soon as I can to some large town , "

120404	120419	120421	120421	Esther	214	" Would nothing ever make it seem right to you to change your mind ? "
120453	120487	120439	120439	she	214	" Suppose , by some means or other , a fortune might come to you honorably by marriage , or in any other unexpected way would you see no change in your course ? "
120488	120491	120493	120493	Felix	134	" No , "
120497	120670	120493	120493	Felix	134	" I will never be rich . I do n't count that as any peculiar virtue . Some men do well to accept riches , but that is not my inward vocation : I have no fellow - feeling with the rich as a class ; the habits of their lives are odious to me . Thousands of men have wedded poverty because they expect to go to heaven for it ; I do n't expect to go to heaven for it , but I we d it because it enables me to do what I most want to do on earth . Whatever the hopes for the world may be whether great or small I am a man of this generation ; I will try to make life less bitter for a few within my reach . It is held reasonable enough to toil for the fortunes of a family , though it may turn to imbecility in the third generation . I choose a family with more chances in it . "
120680	120694	120677	120677	she	214	" That seems a hard lot ; yet it is a great one . "
120701	120712	120714	120714	Felix	134	" Then you do n't think I 'm a fool , "
120734	120744	120677	120677	she	214	" Of course you suspected me of that stupidity . "
120745	120776	120677	120677	she	214	" Well women , unless they are Saint Theresas or Elizabeth Frys , generally think this sort of thing madness , unless when they read of it in the Bible . "
120777	120812	120677	120677	she	214	" A woman can hardly ever choose in that way ; she is dependent on what happens to her . She must take meaner things , because only meaner things are within her reach . "
120813	120827	120829	120829	Felix	134	" Why , can you imagine yourself choosing hardship as the better lot ? "
120842	120848	120849	120849	she	3425	" Yes , I can , "
120906	120911	120902	120902	Felix	134	" Take my arm . "
121012	121018	121019	121019	Felix	134	" It is getting dusk , "
121023	121032	121019	121019	Felix	134	" will Mr. Lyon be anxious about you ? "
121033	121059	121061	121061	Esther	214	" No , I think not . Lyddy would tell him that I went out with you , and that you carried a large stick , "

121219	121225	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" Nay , my friend , "
121230	121275	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" you are again sporting with paradox ; for you will not deny that you glory in the name of Radical , or Root - and - branch man , as they said in the great times when Nonconformity was in its giant youth . "
121276	121298	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" A Radical yes ; but I want to go to some roots a good deal lower down than the franchise . "
121299	121355	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" Truly there is a work within which can not be dispensed with ; but it is our preliminary work to free men from the stifled life of political nullity , and bring them into what Milton calls ' the liberal air , ' wherein alone can be wrought the final triumphs of the Spirit . "
121356	121399	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" With all my heart . But while Caliban is Caliban , though you multiply him by a million , he 'll worship every Trinculo that carries a bottle . I forget , though you do n't read Shakespeare , Mr. Lyon . "
121400	121466	121227	121228	the minister	1433	" I am bound to confess that I have so far looked into a volume of Esther 's as to conceive your meaning ; but the fantasies therein were 236 so little to be reconciled with a steady contemplation of that divine economy which is hidden from sense and revealed to faith , that I forbore the reading , as likely to perturb my ministrations .

122394	122429	122384	122384	Christian	271	" Very badly , I can tell you , with these confounded braces that you were to make such a fine job of . See , old fellow , they 've burst out again . "
122430	122443	122366	122366	he	432	" Very sorry , sir . Can you leave them with me ? "
122444	122461	122463	122463	Christian	271	" Oh , yes , I 'll leave them . What 's the news , eh ? "
122483	122497	122499	122500	Mr. Pink	432	" Well , sir , we look to you to tell us that , "
122507	122584	122499	122500	Mr. Pink	432	" You 're at headquarters eh , sir ? That was what I said to Mr. Scales the other day . He came up for some straps , Mr. Scales did , and he asked that question in pretty near the same terms that you 've done , sir , and I answered him , as I may say , ditto . Not meaning any disrespect to you , sir , but a way of speaking . "
122585	122594	122596	122596	Christian	271	" Come , that 's gammon , Pink , "
122598	122623	122596	122596	Christian	271	" You know everything . You can tell me if you will , who is the fellow employed to paste up Transome 's handbills ? "
122624	122633	122635	122635	Pink	432	" What do you say , Mr. Sims ? "
122642	122680	122499	122500	Mr. Pink	432	" Why , you know and I know well enough . It 's Tommy Trounsem an old , crippling , half - mad fellow . Most people know Tommy . I 've employed him myself for charity . "
122681	122688	122690	122690	Christian	271	" Where shall I find him ? "
122692	122707	122709	122710	Mr. Sims	435	" At the Cross - Keys , in Pollard 's End , most likely , "
122712	122729	122709	122710	Mr. Sims	435	" I do n't know where he puts himself when he is n't at the public . "
122730	122745	122747	122748	Mr. Pink	432	" He was a stoutish fellow fifteen year ago , when he carried pots , "
122750	122763	122765	122766	Mr. Sims	435	" Ay , and has snared many a hare in his time , "
122768	122794	122765	122766	Mr. Sims	435	" But he was always a little cracked . Lord bless you ! he used to swear he had a right to the Transome estate . "
122795	122806	122808	122808	Christian	271	" Why , what put that notion into his head ? "
122818	122841	122843	122844	Mr. Pink	432	" The lawing , sir nothing but the lawing about the estate . There was a deal of it twenty year ago , "
122846	122870	122843	122844	Mr. Pink	432	" Tommy happened to turn up hereabout at that time ; a big , lungeous fellow , who would speak disrespectfully of hanybody . "
122871	122879	122881	122882	Mr. Sims	435	" Oh , he meant no harm , "
122884	122949	122881	122882	Mr. Sims	435	" He was fond of a drop to drink , and not quite right in the upper story , and he could hear no difference between Trounsem and Transome . It 's an odd way of speaking they have in that part where he was born a little north'ard . You 'll hear it in his tongue now , if you talk to him . "
122951	122964	122966	122966	Christian	271	" At the Cross - Keys I shall find him , eh ? "

123833	123841	123826	123826	Christian	271	" Is there an auction coming on ? "
123842	123847	123849	123849	Tommy	384	" Auction ? no , "
123887	123912	123826	123826	Christian	271	" I 've nought to do wi ' auctions ; I 'm a pol'tical charicter . It 's me am getting Trounsem into Parl'ment . "
123913	123919	123920	123921	the landlord	3498	" Trounsem , said he , "
123933	124005	123926	123926	his	3498	" It 's Transome , sir . Maybe you do n't belong to this part . It 's the candidate ' ull do most for the workingmen , and 's proved it too , in the way o ' being open - handed and wishing 'em to enjoy themselves . If I 'd twenty votes , I 'd give one for Transome , and I do n't care who hears me . "
124037	124042	124044	124044	Tommy	384	" Spilkins , now , "
124053	124082	124044	124044	Tommy	384	" you let one gentelman speak to another , will you ? This genelman wants to know about my bills . Does he , or does n't he ? "
124083	124091	124093	124094	the landlord	3498	" What then ? I spoke according , "
124101	124110	124112	124112	Tommy	384	" You 're all very well , Spilkins , "
124114	124316	124112	124112	Tommy	384	" but y'aren't me . I know what the bills are . It 's public business . I 'm none o ' your common bill - stickers , master ; I 've left off sticking up ten guineas reward for a sheep - stealer , or low stuff like that . These are Trounsem 's bills ; and I 'm the rightful family , and so I give him a lift . A Trounsem I am , and a Trounsem I 'll be buried ; and if Old Nick tries to lay hold on me for poaching , I 'll say , ' You be hanged for a lawyer , Old Nick ; every hare and pheasant on the Trounsem 's land is mine ' ; and what rises the family , rises old Tommy ; and we 're going to get into Parl'ment that 's the long and the short on't , master . And I 'm the head o ' the family , and I stick the bills . There 's Johnsons , and Thomsons , and Jacksons , and Billsons ; but I 'm a Trounsem , I am . What do you say to that , master ? "
124347	124362	124339	124339	Christian	271	" I say there is n't any work more honorable than bill - sticking . "
124363	124368	124370	124370	Tommy	384	" No , no , "
124380	124451	124370	124370	Tommy	384	" I thought you 'd come in to that . I thought you 'd know better than say contrairy . But I 'll shake hands wi ' you ; I do n't want to knock any man 's head off . I 'm a good chap a sound crock an old family kep ' out o ' my rights . I shall go to heaven , for all Old Nick . "
124495	124577	124486	124486	his	271	" But I 'll tell you what you bill - stickers are not up to . You should be on the look - out when Debarry 's side have stuck up fresh bills , and go and paste yours over them . I know where there 's a lot of Debarry 's bills now . Come along with me and I 'll show you . We 'll paste them over , and then we 'll come back and treat the company . "
124579	124582	124584	124584	Tommy	384	" Hooray ! "
124586	124593	124584	124584	Tommy	384	" Let 's be off then . "

124775	124862	124772	124772	he	3498	" in respect of entertaining customers of that color . I do my duty as a publican , which , if I know it , is to turn back no genelman 's money . I say , give every genelman a chance , and the more the merrier , in Parl'ment and out of it . And if anybody says they want but two Parl'ment men , I say it ' ud be better for trade if there was six of 'em , and voters according . "
124863	124868	124870	124870	Christian	271	" Ay , ay , "
124872	124894	124870	124870	Christian	271	" you 're a sensible man , landlord . You do n't mean to vote for Debarry , then , eh ? "
124895	124899	124901	124902	the landlord	3498	" Not nohow , "
124934	124995	124932	124932	Tommy	384	" Now , master , if you 're to be my lantern , do n't you be a Jacky Lantern , which I take to mean one as leads you the wrong way . For I 'll tell you what if you 've had the luck to fall in wi ' Tommy Trounsem , do n't you let him drop . "
124996	125005	125007	125007	Christian	271	" No , no to be sure not , "
125009	125024	125007	125007	Christian	271	" Come along here . We 'll go to the Back Brewery wall first . "
125025	125114	125116	125116	Tommy	384	" No , no ; do n't you let me drop . Give me a shilling any day you like , and I 'll tell you more nor you 'll hear from Spilkins in a week . There isna many men like me . I carried pots for fifteen year off and on what do you think o ' that now , for a man as might ha ' lived up there at Trounsem Park , and snared his own game ? Which I 'd ha ' done , "
125130	125191	125116	125116	Tommy	384	" None o ' your shooting for me it 's two to one you 'll miss . Snaring 's more 243 fishing - like . You bait your hook , and if it isna the fishes ' good - will to come , that 's nothing again ' the sporting genelman . And that 's what I say by snaring . "
125192	125227	125119	125119	his	384	" But if you 'd a right to the Transome estate , how was it you were kept out of it , old boy ? It was some foul shame or other , eh ? "
125228	125366	125116	125116	Tommy	384	" It 's the law that 's what it is . You 're a good sort of chap ; I do n't mind telling you . There 's folks born to property , and there 's folks catch hold on it ; and the law 's made for them to catch hold . I 'm pretty deep ; I see a good deal further than Spilkins . There was Ned Patch , the peddler , used to say to me , ' You canna read , Tommy , ' says he . ' No ; thank you , ' says I ; ' I 'm not going to crack my headpiece to make myself as big a fool as you . ' I was fond o ' Ned . Many 's the pot we 've had together . "
125367	125389	125119	125119	his	384	" I see well enough you 're deep , Tommy . How came you to know you were born to property ? "
125390	125399	125401	125401	Tommy	384	" It was the regester the parish regester , "
125411	125633	125401	125401	Tommy	384	" that shows as you was born . I allays felt it inside me as I was somebody , and I could see other chaps thought it on me too ; and so one day at Littleshaw , where I kep ' ferrets and a little bit of a public , there come a fine man looking after me , and walking me up and down wi ' questions . And I made out from the clerk as he 'd been at the regester ; and I gave the clerk a pot or two , and he got it off our parson as the name o ' Trounsem was a great name hereabout . And I waits a bit for my fine man to come again . Thinks I , if there 's property wants a right owner , I shall be called for ; for I did n't know the law then . And I waited and waited , till I see'd no fun i ' waiting . So I parted with my public and my ferrets for she was dead a ' ready , my wife was , and I had n't no cumbrance . And off I started a pretty long walk to this country - side , for I could walk for a wager in them days . "
125634	125685	125404	125404	his	384	" Ah ! well , here we are at the Back Brewery wall . Put down your paste and your basket now , old boy , and I 'll help you . You paste , and I 'll give you the bills , and then you can go on talking . "
125781	125785	125786	125786	Quorlen	418	" highly spiced , "
125790	125804	125786	125786	Quorlen	418	" coming from a pen that was up to that sort of thing . "
125830	125859	125821	125821	He	271	" Here , old boy , paste this over the other . And so , when you got into this country - side , what did you do ? "
125860	126143	125821	125821	He	271	" Why , I put up at a good public and ordered the best , for I 'd a bit o ' money in my pocket ; and I axed about , and they said to me , if it 's Trounsem business you 're after , you go to Lawyer Jermyn . And I went ; and says I , going along , he 's maybe the fine man as walked me up and down . But no such thing . I 'll tell you what Lawyer Jermyn was . He stands you there , and holds you away from him wi ' a pole three yard long . He stares at you , and says nothing , till you feel like a Tomfool ; and then he threats you to set the justice on you ; and then he 's sorry for you , and hands you money , and preaches you a sarmint , and tells you you 're a poor man , and he 'll give you a bit of advice and you 'd better not be meddling wi ' things belonging to the law , else you be catched up in a big wheel and fly to bits . And I went of a cold sweat , and I wished I might never come i ' sight o ' Lawyer Jermyn again . But he says , if you keep i ' this neighborhood , behave yourself well , and I 'll pertect you . I were deep enough , but it 's no use being deep , 'cause you can never know the law . And there 's times when the deepest fellow 's most frightened . "
126144	126162	125821	125821	He	271	" Yes , yes . There ! Now for another placard . And so that was all ? "
126163	126166	126168	126168	Tommy	384	" All ? "
126181	126435	126168	126168	Tommy	384	" Do n't you be running too quick . Thinks I , ' I 'll meddle no more . I 've got a bit o ' money I 'll buy a basket , and be a pot - man . It 's a pleasant life . I shall live at publics and see the world , and pick ' quaintance , and get a chance penny . ' But when I 'd turned into the Red Lion , and got myself warm again wi ' a drop o ' hot , something jumps into my head . Thinks I , Tommy , you 've done finely for yourself : you 're a rat as has broke up your house to take a journey , and show yourself to a ferret . And then it jumps into my head : I 'd once two ferrets as turned on one another , and the little un killed the big un . Says I to the landlady , ' Missus , could you tell me of a lawyer , ' says I , ' not very big or fine , but a second - size a big - potato , like ? ' ' That I can , ' 245 says she ; ' there 's one now in the bar parlor . ' ' Be so kind as bring us together , ' says I. And she cries out I think I hear her now ' Mr. Johnson ! ' And what do you think ? "
126533	126546	126524	126524	Christian	271	" It 's wonderful . I ca n't tell what to think . "
126547	126556	126558	126558	Tommy	384	" Then never do you deny Old Nick , "
126563	126897	126558	126558	Tommy	384	" I 've believed in him more ever since . Who was Johnson ? Why , Johnson was the fine man as had walked me up and down with questions . And I out with it to him then and there . And he speaks me civil , and says , ' Come away wi ' me , my good fellow . ' And he told me a deal o ' law . And he says , ' Whether you 're a Tommy Trounsem or no , it 's no good to you , but only to them as have got hold o ' the property . If you was a Tommy Trounsem twenty times over , it ' ud be no good , for the law 's bought you out ; and your life 's no good , only to them as have catched hold o ' the property . The more you live , the more they 'll stick in . Not as they want you now , ' says he ' you 're no good to anybody , and you might howl like a dog foriver , and the law ' ud take no notice on you . ' Says Johnson , ' I 'm doing a kind thing by you to tell you . For that 's the law . ' And if you want to know the law , master , you ask Johnson . I heard 'em say after , as he was an understrapper at Jermyn 's . I 've never forgot it from that day to this . But I saw clear enough , as if the law had n't been again ' me , the Trounsem estate ' ud ha ' been mine . But folks are fools hereabouts , and I 've left off talking . The more you tell 'em the truth , the more they 'll niver believe you . And I went and bought my basket and the pots , and "
126898	126905	126907	126907	Christian	271	" Come then , fire away , "
126909	126915	126907	126907	Christian	271	" Here 's another placard . "
126916	126926	126959	126959	his	271	" I 'm getting a bit dry , master . "
126927	126946	126907	126907	Christian	271	" Well , then , make haste , and you 'll have something to drink all the sooner . "
126964	126975	126956	126956	Christian	271	" And how long has Mr. Jermyn been employing you ? "
126976	127086	126959	126959	his	271	" Oh , no particular time off and on ; but a week or two ago he sees me upo ' the road , and speaks to me uncommon civil , and tells me to go up to his office and he 'll give me employ . And I was noways unwilling to stick the bills to get the family into Parl'ment . For there 's no man can help the law . And the family 's the family , whether you carry pots or no .

We know what that comes to : in some countries a poor man ca n't afford to buy a spoonful of salt , and yet there 's salt enough in the world to pickle every living thing in it . That 's the sort of benefit monopolists do to mankind . And these are the men who tell us we 're to let politics alone ; they 'll govern us better without our knowing anything about it . We must mind our business ; we are ignorant ; we 've no time to study great questions . But I tell them this : the greatest question in the world is , how to give every man a man 's share in what goes on in life "
132868	132873	132875	132875	Felix	134	" Hear , hear ! "
132936	132943	132944	132945	the speaker	2770	" Not a pig 's share , "
132949	133888	132944	132945	the speaker	2770	" not a horse 's , not the share of a machine fed with oil only to make it work and nothing else . It 258 is n't a man 's share just to mind your pin - making , or your glass - blowing , and higgle about your own wages , and bring up your family to be ignorant sons of ignorant fathers , and no better prospect ; that 's a slave 's share ; we want a freeman 's share , and that is to think and speak and act about what concerns us all , and see whether these fine gentlemen who undertake to govern us are doing the best they can for us . They 've got the knowledge , say they . Very well , we 've got the wants . There 's many a one would be idle if hunger did n't pinch him ; but the stomach sets us to work . There 's a fable told where the nobles are the belly and the people the members . But I make another sort of fable . I say , we are the belly that feels the pinches , and we 'll set these aristocrats , these great people who call themselves our brains , to work at some way of satisfying us a bit better . The aristocrats are pretty sure to try and govern for their own benefit ; but how are we to be sure they 'll try and govern for ours ? They must be looked after , I think , like other workmen . We must have what we call inspectors , to see whether the work 's well done for us . We want to send our inspectors to Parliament . Well , they say you 've got the Reform Bill ; what more can you want ? Send your inspectors . But I say , the Reform Bill is a trick it 's nothing but swearing - in special constables to keep the aristocrats safe in their monopoly ; it 's bribing some of the people with votes to make them hold their tongues about giving votes to the rest . I say , if a man does n't beg or steal , but works for his bread , the poorer and the more miserable he is , the more he 'd need have a vote to send an inspector to Parliament else the man who is worst off is likely to be forgotten ; and I say , he 's the man who ought to be first remembered . Else what does their religion mean ? Why do they build churches and endow them that their sons may get paid well for preaching a Saviour , and making themselves as little like Him as can be ? If I want to believe in Jesus Christ , I must shut my eyes for fear I should see a parson . And what 's a bishop ? A bishop 's a person dressed up , who sits in the House of Lords to help and throw out Reform Bills . And because it 's hard to get anything in the shape of a man to dress himself up like that , and do such work , they have to give him a palace for it , and plenty of thousands a - year . And then they cry out ' The Church is in danger , ' ' the poor man 's Church . ' And why is it the poor man 's Church ? Because he can have a seat for nothing . I think it is for nothing ; for it would be hard to tell what he gets by it . If the 259 poor man had a vote in the matter , I think he 'd choose a different sort of Church to what that is . But do you think the aristocrats will ever alter it , if the belly does n't pinch them ? Not they . It 's part of their monopoly . They 'll supply us with our religion like everything else , and get a profit on it . They 'll give us plenty of heaven . We may have land there . That 's the sort of religion they like a religion that gives us workingmen heaven , and nothing else . But we 'll offer to change with them . We 'll give them back some of their heaven , and take it out in something for us and our children in this world . They do n't seem to care so much about heaven themselves till they feel the gout very bad ; but you wo n't get them to give up anything else , if you do n't pinch 'em for it . And to pinch them enough , we must get the suffrage , we must get votes , that we may send the men to Parliament who will do our work for us ; and we must have Parliament dissolved every year , that we may change our man if he does n't do what we want him to do ; and we must have the country divided so that the little kings of the counties ca n't do as they like , but must be shaken up in one bag with us . I say , if we workingmen are ever to get a man 's share , we must have universal suffrage , and annual Parliaments , and the vote by ballot , and electoral districts . "
133889	133898	133900	133900	Felix	134	" No ! something else before all that , "
133922	134041	133912	133913	the speaker	2770	" That 's what Sir Francis Burdett went in for fifteen years ago ; and it 's the right thing for us , if it was Tomfool who went in for it . You must lay hold of such handles as you can . I do n't believe much in Liberal aristocrats ; but if there 's any fine carved gold - headed stick of an aristocrat will make a broomstick of himself , I 'll lose no time but I 'll sweep with him . And that 's what I think about Transome . And if any of you have acquaintance among county voters , give 'em a hint that you wish 'em to vote for Transome . "
134110	134120	134101	134101	he	2770	" Come , sir , what do you say ? "
134260	134266	134220	134221	Felix Holt	134	" the human face divine . "
134400	134405	134406	134406	he	2770	" In my opinion , "
134417	134874	134406	134406	he	2770	" that was a true word spoken by your friend when he said the great question was how to give every man a man 's share in life . But I think he expects voting to do more toward it than I do . I want the workingmen to have power . I 'm a workingman myself , and I do n't want to be anything else . But there are two sorts of power . There 's a power to do mischief to undo what has been done with great expense and labor , to waste and destroy , to be cruel to the weak , to lie and quarrel , and to talk poisonous nonsense . That 's the sort of power that ignorant numbers have . It never made a joint stool or planted a potato . Do you think it 's likely to do much toward governing a great country , and making wise laws , and giving shelter , food , and clothes to millions of men ? Ignorant power comes in the end to the same thing as wicked power ; it makes misery . It 's another sort of power that I want us workingmen to have , and I can see plainly enough that our all having votes will do little toward it at present . I hope we , or the children that come after us , will get plenty of political power some time . I tell everybody plainly , I hope there will be great changes , and that some time , whether we 261 live to see it or not , men will have come to be ashamed of things they 're proud of now . But I should like to convince you that votes would never give you political power worth having while things are as they are now , and that if you go the right way to work you may get power sooner without votes . Perhaps all you who hear me are sober men , who try to learn as much of the nature of things as you can , and to be as little like fools as possible . A fool or idiot is one who expects things to happen that never can happen ; he pours milk into a can without a bottom , and expects the milk to stay there . The more of such vain expectations a man has , the more he is a fool or idiot . And if any working man expects a vote to do for him what it never can do , he 's foolish to that amount , if no more . I think that 's clear enough , eh ? "
134875	134880	134895	134895	they	3740	" Hear , hear , "
134991	135207	134972	134972	Felix	134	" The way to get rid of folly is to get rid of vain expectations , and of thoughts that do n't agree with the nature of things . The men who have had true thoughts about water , and what it will do when it is turned into steam and under all sorts of circumstances , have made themselves a great power in the world : they are turning the wheels of engines that will help to change most things . But no engines would have done , if there had been false notions about the way water would act . Now , all the schemes about voting , and districts , and annual Parliaments , and the rest , are engines , and the water or steam the force that is to work them must come out of human nature out of men 's passions , feelings , desires . Whether the engines will do good work or bad depends on these feelings ; and if we have false expectations about men 's characters , we are very much like the idiot who thinks he 'll carry milk in a can without a bottom . In my opinion , the notions about what mere voting will do are very much of that sort . "
135209	135215	135217	135221	a man in dirty fustian	3747	" That 's very fine , "
135228	135240	135217	135221	a man in dirty fustian	3747	" But how are we to get the power without votes ? "
135241	135254	135256	135256	Felix	134	" I 'll tell you what 's the greatest power under heaven , "
135258	135600	135256	135256	Felix	134	" and that is public opinion the ruling belief in society about what is right and what is wrong , what is honorable and what is shameful . That 's the steam that is to work the engines . How can political freedom make us better , any more than a religion we do n't believe in , if people laugh and wink when they see men abuse and defile it ? And while public opinion is what it is while men have no better beliefs about public duty while corruption is not felt to be a damning disgrace while men are not ashamed in Parliament and out of it to make public questions which concern the welfare of millions a mere screen for their own petty private ends , I say , no fresh scheme of voting will much mend our condition . For , take us workingmen of all sorts . Suppose out of every hundred who had a vote there were thirty who had some soberness , some sense to choose with , some good feeling to make them wish the right thing for all . And suppose there were seventy out of the hundred who were , half of them , not sober , who had no sense to choose one thing in politics more than another , and who had so little good feeling in them that they wasted on their own drinking the money that should have helped to feed and clothe their wives and children ; and another half of them who , if they did n't drink , were too ignorant or stupid to see any good for themselves better than pocketing a five - shilling piece when it was offered them . Where would be the political power of the thirty sober men ? The power would lie with the seventy drunken and stupid votes ; and I 'll tell you what sort of men would get the power what sort of men would end by returning whom they pleased to Parliament . "
135677	136053	135671	135671	His	3748	" They would be men who would undertake to do the business for a candidate , and return him : men who have no real opinions , but who pilfer the words of every opinion , and turn them into a ca nt which will serve their purpose at the moment ; men who look out for dirty work to make their fortunes by , because dirty work wants little talent and no 263 conscience ; men who know all the ins and outs of bribery , because there is not a cranny in their own souls where a bribe ca n't enter . Such men as these will be the masters wherever there 's a majority of voters who care more for money , for drink , more for some mean little end which is their own and nobody else 's , than for anything that has ever been called Right in the world . For suppose there 's a poor voter named Jack , who has seven children , and twelve or fifteen shillings a - week wages , perhaps less . Jack ca n't read I do n't say whose fault that is he never had the chance to learn ; he knows so little that he perhaps thinks God made the poor - laws , and if anybody said the pattern of the work - house was laid down in the Testament , he would n't be able to contradict them . What is poor Jack likely to do when he sees a smart stranger coming to him , who happens to be just one of these men that I say will be the masters till public opinion gets too hot for them ? He 's a middle - sized man , we 'll say ; stout , with coat upon coat of fine broadcloth , open enough to show a fine gold chain : none of your dark , scowling men , but one with an innocent pink - and - white skin and very smooth light hair a most respectable man , who calls himself a good , sound , well - known English name as Green , or Baker , or Wilson , or let us say , Johnson "
136242	136248	136250	136250	Christian	271	" Who is this Johnson ? "
136288	136340	136250	136250	Christian	271	" Oh a London attorney . He acts for Transome . That tremendous fellow at the corner there is some red - hot Radical demagogue , and Johnson has offended him , I suppose ; else he would n't have turned in that way on a man of their own party . "
136341	136357	136359	136359	Christian	271	" I had heard there was a Johnson who was an understrapper of Jermyn 's , "
136361	136423	136250	136250	Christian	271	" Well , so this man may have been for what I know . But he 's a London man now a very busy fellow on his own legs in Bedford Row . Ha , ha ! it 's capital , though , when these Liberals get a slap in the face from the workingmen they 're so very fond of . "
137022	137151	137187	137187	horsemen	3777	" In the copia of the factious language the word Tory was entertained , and being a vocal clever - sounding word , readily pronounced , it kept its hold , and took possession of the foul mouths of the faction . The Loyalists began to cheer up and to take heart of grace , and in the working of this crisis , according to the common law of scolding , they considered which way to make payment for so much of Tory as they had been treated with to clear scores . Immediately the train took , and ran like wildfire and became general . And so the account of Tory was balanced , and soon began to run up a sharp score on the other side . "

138612	138766	138448	138448	Rose	373	" No , no , thankye . Mrs. Rose expects me back . But , as I was saying , I 'm a independent man , and I consider it 's not my part to show favor to one more than another , but to make things as even as I can . If I 'd been a tenant to anybody , well , in course I must have voted for my landlord that stands to sense . But I wish everybody well ; and if one 's returned to Parliament more than another , nobody can say it 's my doing ; for when you can vote for two , you can make things even . So I gave one to Debarry and one to Transome ; and I wish Garstin no ill , but I ca n't help the odd number , and he hangs on to Debarry , they say . "
138767	138774	138776	138777	Mr. Nolan	367	" God bless me , sir , "
138784	138818	138776	138777	Mr. Nolan	367	" do n't you perceive that you might as well have stayed at home and not voted at all , unless you would rather send a Radical to Parliament than a sober Whig ? "
138819	138839	138841	138842	Mr. Rose	373	" Well , I 'm sorry you should have anything to say against what I 've done , Nolan , "
138853	138901	138903	138904	Mr. Rose	373	" I thought you 'd agree with me , as you 're a sensible man . But the most a independent man can do is to try and please all ; and if he has n't the luck here 's wishing I may do it another time , "

147717	147722	147723	147723	He	4259	" Poor old fellow ! "
149040	149149	149031	149031	Harold	144	" Poor mother ! I confess I should not like to be an elderly woman myself . One requires a good deal of the purring cat for that , or else of the loving gran - dame . I wish she would take more to little Harry . I suppose she has her suspicions about the lad 's mother , and is as rigid in those matters as in her Toryism . However , I do what 289 I can ; it would be difficult to say what there is wanting to her in the way of indulgence and luxury to make up for the old niggardly life . "
149710	149715	149706	149706	Jermyn	173	" Good - morning , "
149882	149886	149887	149887	he	144	" Sit down , "
149910	149917	149919	149919	Harold	144	" I have written to Makepeace , "
149921	149944	149919	149919	Harold	144	" to tell him to take the entire management of the election expenses . So you will transmit your accounts to him . "
149945	149958	149871	149871	He	144	" Very well . I am come this morning on other business . "
149959	150018	149919	149919	Harold	144	" If it 's about the riot and the prisoners , I have only to say that I shall enter into no plans . If I am called on , I shall say what I know about that young fellow Felix Holt . People may prove what they can about Johnson 's damnable tricks , or yours either . "
150019	150042	149871	149871	He	144	" I am not come to speak about the riot . I agree with you in thinking that quite a subordinate subject . "
150065	150080	150082	150082	Harold	144	" Be so good , then , as to open your business at once , "
150092	150123	150127	150127	he	173	" That is precisely what I wish to do . I have here information from a London correspondent that you are about to file a bill against me in Chancery . "
150145	150182	150131	150131	his	173	" In that case , the question for you is , how far your conduct as the family solicitor will bear investigation . But it is a question which you will consider quite apart from me . "
150183	150200	150205	150205	Jermyn	173	" Doubtless . But prior to that there is a question which we must consider together . "
150234	150244	150245	150245	he	144	" I shall know what to think of that , "
150253	150263	150245	150245	he	144	" when you have stated what the question is . "
150264	150289	150131	150131	his	173	" Simply , whether you will choose to retain the family estates , or lay yourself open to be forthwith legally deprived of them . "
150290	150320	150322	150322	Harold	144	" I presume you refer to some underhand scheme of your own , on a par with the annuities you have drained us by in the name of Johnson , "
150331	150349	150322	150322	Harold	144	" If so , you had better state your scheme to my lawyers , Dymock and Halliwell . "
150350	150405	150131	150131	his	173	" No . I think you will approve of my stating in your own ear first of all , that it depends on my will whether you remain an important landed proprietor in North Loamshire , or whether you retire from the country with the remainder of the fortune you have acquired in trade . "
150421	150427	150429	150429	Harold	144	" What do you mean ? "
150433	150489	150131	150131	his	173	" Not any scheme of mine ; but a state of the facts resulting from the settlement of the estate made in 1729 : state of the facts which renders your father 's title and your own title to the family estates utterly worthless as soon as the claimant is made aware of his right . "
150490	150498	150563	150563	Jermyn	173	" And you intend to inform him ? "
150499	150562	150131	150131	his	173	" That depends . I am the only person who has the requisite knowledge . It rests with you to decide whether I shall use that knowledge against you ; or whether I shall use it in your favor by putting an end to the evidence that would serve to oust you in spite of your ' robust title of occupancy . ' "
150603	150610	150600	150600	he	144	" I do n't believe you . "
150611	150619	150621	150621	Jermyn	173	" I thought you were more shrewd , "
150629	150664	150621	150621	Jermyn	173	" I thought you understood that I had had too much experience to waste my time in telling fables to persuade a man who has put himself into the attitude of my deadly enemy . "
150665	150678	150680	150680	Harold	144	" Well , then , say at once what your proofs are , "
150692	150771	150621	150621	Jermyn	173	" I have no inclination to be lengthy . It is not more than a few weeks since I ascertained that there is in existence an heir of the Bycliffes , the old adversaries of your family . More curiously , it is only a few days ago in fact , only since the day of the riot that the Bycliffe claim has become valid , and that the right of remainder accrues to the heir in question . "
150772	150778	150780	150780	Harold	144	" And how , pray ? "
150823	150950	150803	150803	Jermyn	173	" By the death of an old fellow who got drunk and was trampled to death in the riot . He was the last of that Thomas Transome 's line , by the purchase of whose interest your family got its title to the estate . Your title died with him . It was supposed that the line had become extinct before and on that supposition the old Bycliffes founded their claim . But I hunted up this man just about the time the last suit was closed . His death would have been of no consequence to you if there had not been a Bycliffe in existence ; but I happen to know that there is , and that the fact can be legally proved . "
150998	151015	150982	150982	Harold	144	" That sounds alarming . But it is not to be proved simply by your statement . "
151016	151066	150982	150982	Harold	144	" Clearly . I have here a document , with a copy which will back my statement . It is the opinion given on the case more than twenty years ago , and it bears the signature of the Attorney - General and the first conveyancer of the day . "
151097	151181	151182	151182	Jermyn	173	" You may suppose that we spared no pains to ascertain the state of the title in the last suit against Maurice Christian Bycliffe , which 293 threatened to be a hard run . This document is the result of a consultation ; it gives an opinion which must be taken as a final authority . You may cast your eyes over that , if you please ; I will wait your time . Or you may read the summing - up here , "
151430	151557	151428	151428	Jermyn	173	" As it turned out , the case being closed by the death of the claimant , we had no occasion for producing Thomas Transome , who was the old fellow I told you of . The enquiries about him set him agog , and after they were dropped he came into this neighborhood , thinking there was something fine in store for him . Here , if you like to take it , is a memorandum about him . I repeat that he died in the riot . The proof is ready . And I repeat , that , to my knowledge , and mine only , there is a Bycliffe in existence ; and that I know how the proof can be made out . "
151579	151587	151588	151588	he	144	" And where is he this Bycliffe ? "
151604	151619	151602	151602	Jermyn	173	" I decline to say more till you promise to suspend proceedings against me . "
151668	151678	151666	151666	he	144	" This person is in ignorance of his claim ? "
151679	151682	151666	151666	he	144	" Yes . "
151683	151693	151666	151666	he	144	" Has been brought up in an inferior station ? "
151694	151697	151699	151699	Jermyn	173	" Yes , "
151716	151782	151699	151699	Jermyn	173	" There is no harm in leaving him in ignorance . The question is a purely legal one . And , as I said before , the complete knowledge of the case , as one of evidence , lies exclusively with me . I can nullify the evidence , or I can make it tell with certainty against you . The choice lies with you . "
151783	151793	151795	151795	Harold	144	" I must have time to think of this , "
151803	151818	151666	151666	he	144	" I can give you no time unless you promise me to suspend proceedings . "
151819	151836	151699	151699	Jermyn	173	" And then , when I ask you , you will lay the details before me ? "
151837	151893	151666	151666	he	144	" Not without a thorough understanding beforehand . If I engage not to use my knowledge against you , you must engage in writing that on being satisfied by the details , you will cancel all hostile proceedings against me , and will not institute fresh ones on the strength of any occurrences now past . "
151894	151902	151904	151904	Harold	144	" Well , I must have time , "
151933	151939	151941	151941	Jermyn	173	" That is to say , "
151950	151958	151944	151944	his	173	" you will write to suspend proceedings . "
152048	152056	152040	152040	he	144	" I agree I must have time . "
152057	152066	152040	152040	he	144	" Very well . It is a bargain . "
152067	152073	152075	152075	Harold	144	" No further than this , "
152084	152103	152040	152040	he	144	" no further than this , that I require time , and therefore I give it to you . "
152104	152145	152083	152083	Jermyn	173	" Of course . You require time to consider whether the pleasure of trying to ruin me me to whom you are really indebted is worth the loss of the Transome estates . I shall wish you good - morning . "
152318	152327	152328	152328	she	269	" Men have no memories in their hearts , "
153584	153588	153570	153570	Dominic	150	" Meester Chreestian , "
153768	153772	153778	153778	he	333	" know the world "
153817	153871	153811	153811	he	333	" You will probably be surprised , sir , at my coming to speak to you on my own account ; and , in fact , I could not have thought of doing so if my business did not happen to be something of more importance to you than to any one else . "
153872	153883	153885	153885	Harold	144	" You do n't come from Mr. Debarry , then ? "
153891	153912	153811	153811	he	333	" No , sir . My business is a secret ; and , if you please , must remain so . "
153913	153924	153926	153926	Harold	144	" Is it a pledge you are demanding from me ? "
153944	153975	153811	153811	he	333	" Yes , sir ; I am obliged to ask no less than that you will pledge yourself not to take Mr. Jermyn into confidence concerning what passes between us . "
153976	153982	153984	153984	Harold	144	" With all my heart , "
154002	154013	153984	153984	Harold	144	" But what have you had to do with Jermyn ? "
154014	154028	153811	153811	he	333	" He has not mentioned me to you then has he , sir ? "
154029	154036	153984	153984	Harold	144	" No ; certainly not never . "
154040	154056	154057	154057	He	333	" Aha , Mr. Jermyn ! you are keeping the secret well , are you ? "
154061	154104	154057	154057	He	333	" Then Mr. Jermyn has never mentioned to you , sir , what I believe he is aware of that there is danger of a new suit being raised against you on the part of a Bycliffe , to get the estate ? "
154105	154108	154110	154110	Harold	144	" Ah ! "
154185	154199	154176	154176	Christian	333	" It is this fact , that I came to tell you of . "
154200	154213	154215	154215	Harold	144	" From some other motive than kindness to me , I presume , "
154225	154228	154230	154230	Christian	333	" Certainly , "
154244	154322	154236	154236	he	333	" I should not have the folly to use any affectation with you , Mr. Transome . I lost considerable property early in life , and am now in the receipt of a salary simply . In the affair I have just mentioned to you I can give evidence which will turn the scale against you . I have no wish to do so , if you will make it worth my while to leave the country . "
154398	154403	154404	154404	he	144	" You are aware , "
154409	154460	154404	154404	he	144	" that silence is not a commodity worth purchasing unless it is loaded . There are many persons , I dare say , who would like me to pay their travelling expenses for them . But they might hardly be able to show me that it was worth my while . "
154461	154471	154681	154681	Harold	144	" You wish me to state what I know ? "
154472	154485	154404	154404	he	144	" Well , that is a necessary preliminary to any further conversation . "
154486	154569	154681	154681	Harold	144	" I think you will see , Mr. Transome , that , as a matter of justice , the knowledge I can give is worth something , quite apart from my future appearance or non - appearance as a witness . I must take care of my own interest , and if anything should hinder you from choosing to satisfy me for taking an essential witness out of the way , I must at least be paid for bringing you the information . "
154570	154582	154404	154404	he	144	" Can you tell me who and where this Bycliffe is ? "
154583	154587	154681	154681	Harold	144	" I can . "
154588	154599	154404	154404	he	144	" -And give me a notion of the whole affair ? "
154600	154623	154681	154681	Harold	144	" Yes ; I have talked to a lawyer not Jermyn who is at the bottom of the law in the affair . "
154625	154651	154404	154404	he	144	" You must not count on any wish of mine to suppress evidence or remove a witness . But name your price for the information . "
154652	154672	154681	154681	Harold	144	" In that case I must be paid the higher for my information . Say , two thousand pounds . "
154673	154678	154681	154681	Harold	144	" Two thousand devils ! "
154703	154716	154717	154717	he	144	" This fellow may want to decamp for some reason or other , "
154722	154764	154717	154717	he	144	" More people besides Jermyn know about his evidence , it seems . The whole thing may look black for me if it comes out . I shall be believed to have bribed him to run away , whether or not . "
154776	154788	154789	154789	he	144	" I will not give you one sixpence for your information , "
154794	154876	154789	154789	he	144	" until time has made it clear that you do not intend to decamp , but will be forthcoming when you are called for . On those terms I have no objection to give you a note , specifying that after the fulfilment of that condition that is , after the occurrence of a suit , or the understanding that no suit is to occur I will pay you a certain sum in consideration of the information you now give me ! "
155134	155153	155131	155131	he	333	" I think , sir , two thousand would not be an unreasonable sum , on those conditions . "
155154	155162	155131	155131	he	333	" I will not give two thousand . "
155163	155229	155131	155131	he	333	" Allow me to say , sir , you must consider that there is no one whose interest it is to tell you as much as I shall , even if they could ; since Mr. Jermyn , who knows it , has not thought fit to tell you . There may be use you do n't think of in getting the information at once . "
155230	155233	155131	155131	he	333	" Well ? "
155234	155246	155131	155131	he	333	" I think a gentleman should act liberally under such circumstances . "
155247	155252	155131	155131	he	333	" So I will . "
155253	155290	155131	155131	he	333	" I could not take less than a thousand pounds . It really would not be worth my while . If Mr. Jermyn knew I gave you the information , he would endeavor to injure me . "
155291	155299	155301	155301	Harold	144	" I will give you a thousand , "
155314	155331	155301	155301	Harold	144	" At least , I 'll give you a note to the effect I spoke of . "
155346	155354	155356	155356	Harold	144	" Now , do n't be circuitous , "
155358	155378	155356	155356	Harold	144	" You seem to have a business - like gift of speech . Who and where is this Bycliffe ? "
155379	155408	155335	155335	he	144	" You will be surprised to hear , sir , that she is supposed to be the daughter of the old preacher , Lyon , in Malthouse Yard . "
155409	155418	155420	155420	Harold	144	" Good God ! How can that be ? "
155456	155527	155442	155454	the graceful girl in blue , with the surprisingly distinguished manners and appearance	4415	" In this way . Old Lyon , by some strange means or other , married Bycliffe 's widow when this girl was a baby . And the preacher did n't want the girl to know that he was not her real father : he told me that himself . But she is the image of Bycliffe , whom I knew well an uncommonly fine woman steps like a queen . "
155528	155534	155536	155536	Harold	144	" I have seen her , "
155548	155555	155536	155536	Harold	144	" But now , go on . "
155582	155585	155587	155587	Harold	144	" Then , "
155600	155630	155587	155587	Harold	144	" you believe that Miss Lyon and her supposed father are at present unaware of the claims that might be urged for her on the strength of her birth ? "
155631	155683	155701	155701	Christian	333	" I believe so . But I need not tell you that where the lawyers are on the scent you can never be sure of anything long together . I must 302 remind you , sir , that you have promised to protect me from Mr. Jermyn by keeping my confidence . "
155684	155700	155587	155587	Harold	144	" Never fear . Depend upon it , I shall betray nothing to Mr. Jermyn . "
155706	155710	155701	155701	Christian	333	" good - morning "
155931	155936	155922	155922	he	144	" not a marrying man "
156800	156823	156824	156824	Harold	269	" Now , what I want you to do , mother , if you can see this matter as I see it , "
156829	156902	156824	156824	Harold	269	" is to go with me to call on this girl in Malthouse Yard . I will open the affair to her ; it appears she is not likely to have been informed yet ; and you will invite her to visit you here at once , that all scandal , all hatching of law - mischief , may be avoided , and the thing may be brought to an amicable conclusion . "
156903	156915	156917	156918	Mrs. Transome	269	" It seems almost incredible extraordinary a girl in her position , "
156945	156987	156824	156824	Harold	269	" I assure you she is a lady ; I saw her when I was canvassing , and was amazed at the time . You will be quite struck with her . It is no indignity for you to invite her . "
156988	156991	156993	156994	Mrs. Transome	269	" Oh , "
157002	157022	156993	156994	Mrs. Transome	269	" I must put up with all things as they are determined for me . When shall we go ? "
157023	157026	157028	157028	Harold	269	" Well , "
157035	157069	157028	157028	Harold	269	" it is hardly two yet . We could really go to - day , when you have lunched . It is better to lose no time . I 'll order the carriage . "
157070	157073	157075	157076	Mrs. Transome	269	" Stay , "
157083	157102	157075	157076	Mrs. Transome	269	" There is plenty of time . I shall not lunch . I have a word to say . "
157119	157132	157075	157076	Mrs. Transome	269	" You see I comply with your wish at once , Harold ? "
157133	157149	157028	157028	Harold	269	" Yes , mother , I 'm much obliged to you for making no difficulties . "
157151	157161	157028	157028	Harold	269	" You ought to listen to me in return . "
157162	157167	157169	157169	Harold	269	" Pray go on , "
157176	157189	157028	157028	Harold	269	" What is the good of having these Chancery proceedings against Jermyn ? "
157190	157361	157075	157076	Mrs. Transome	269	" Good ? This good : that fellow has burdened the estate with annuities and mortgages to the extent of three thousand a year ; and the bulk of them , I am certain , he holds himself under the name of another man . And the advances this yearly interest represents , have not been much more than twenty thousand . Of course , he has hoodwinked you , and my father never gave attention to these things . He has been up to all sorts of devil 's work with the deeds ; he did n't count on my coming back from Smyrna to fill poor Durfey 's place . He shall feel the difference . And the good will be , that I shall save almost all the annuities for the rest of my father 's life , which may be ten years or more , and I shall get back some of the money , and I shall punish a scoundrel . That is the good . "
157362	157368	157028	157028	Harold	269	" He will be ruined . "
157369	157376	157378	157378	Harold	269	" That 's what I intend , "
157382	157405	157407	157408	Mrs. Transome	269	" He exerted himself a great deal for us in the old suits : everyone said he had wonderful zeal and ability , "
157425	157443	157445	157445	Harold	269	" What he did , he did for his own sake , you may depend on that , "
157452	157517	157028	157028	Harold	269	" There were very painful things in that last suit . You seem anxious about this young woman , to avoid all further scandal and contests in the family . Why do n't you wish to do it in this case ? Jermyn might be willing to arrange things amicably to make restitution as far as he can if he has done anything wrong . "
157518	157527	157529	157529	Harold	269	" I will arrange nothing amicably with him , "
157533	157625	157529	157529	Harold	269	" If he has ever done anything scandalous as our agent , let him bear the infamy . And the right way to throw the infamy on him is to show the world that he has robbed us , and that I mean to punish him . Why do you wish to shield such a fellow , mother ? It has been chiefly through him that you have had to lead such a thrifty , miserable life you who used to make as brilliant a figure as a woman need wish . "
157711	157720	157722	157722	Harold	269	" Women are frightened at everything I know , "
157740	157762	157763	157763	he	4443	" And you have been used for so many years to think Jermyn a law of nature . Come , mother , "
157780	157843	157763	157763	he	4443	" look cheerful . We shall get through all these difficulties . And this girl I dare say she will be quite an interesting visitor for you . You have not had any young girl about you for a long while . Who knows ? she may fall deeply in love with me , and I may be obliged to marry her . "
157867	157875	157859	157859	she	782	" Do you mean that , Harold ? "
157876	157902	157859	157859	she	782	" Am I not capable of making a conquest ? Not too fat yet a handsome , well - rounded youth of thirty - four ? "
157981	157986	157988	157988	Harold	269	" There , there ! "
157992	158022	157988	157988	Harold	269	" Do n't be afraid . You shall not have a daughter - in - law unless she is a pearl . Now we will get ready to go . "
158046	158053	158030	158031	Mrs. Transome	269	" the girl in Malthouse Yard . "
158390	158411	158412	158412	he	208	" My poor young friend is being taught with mysterious severity the evil of a too confident self - reliance , "
158430	158440	158412	158412	he	208	" You will go and see him , father ? "
158441	158477	158478	158479	Mr. Lyon	208	" Verily will I. But I must straightway go and see that poor afflicted woman , whose soul is doubtless whirled about in this trouble like a shapeless and unstable thing driven by divided winds . "
158507	158521	158523	158523	Esther	214	" Stay , father , pray , till you have had some food , "
158532	158540	158523	158523	Esther	214	" You look quite weary and shattered . "
158541	158622	158526	158526	her	214	" Child , I can not stay . I can neither eat bread nor drink water till I have learned more about this young man 's deeds , what can be proved and what can not be proved against him . I fear he has none to stand by him in this town , for even by the friends of our church I have been ofttimes rebuked because he seemed dear to me . But , Esther , my beloved child "
158643	158797	158624	158625	Mr. Lyon	208	" I bear in mind this : the Lord knoweth them that are His ; but we we are left to judge by uncertain signs , 308 that so we may learn to exercise hope and faith toward one another ; and in this uncertainty I cling with awful hope to those whom the world loves not because their conscience , albeit mistakenly , is at war with the habits of the world . Our great faith , my Esther , is the faith of martyrs : I will not lightly turn away from any man who endures harshness because he will not lie ; nay , though I would not wantonly grasp at ease of mind through an arbitrary choice of doctrine , I can not but believe that the merits of the Divine Sacrifice are wider than our utmost charity . I once believed otherwise but not now , not now . "
159066	159073	159082	159082	herself	4466	" And now , Mr. Lyon , "
159116	159295	159107	159107	she	4466	" and now you see my words have come true sooner than I thought they would . Felix may contradict me if he will ; but there he is in prison , and here am I , with nothing in the world to bless myself with but half - a - crown a - week as I 've saved by my own scraping , and this house I 've got to pay rent for . It 's not me has done wrong , Mr. Lyon ; 309 there 's nobody can say it of me not the orphan child on my knee is more innicent o ' riot and murder and anything else as is bad . But when you 've got a son so masterful and stopping medicines as Providence has sent , and his betters have been taking up and down the country since before he was a baby , it 's o ' no use being good here below . But he was a baby , Mr. Lyon , and I gave him the breast , "
159321	159353	159319	159319	she	205	" And to think there 's folks saying now as he 'll be transported , and his hair shaved off , and the treadmill , and everything . Oh , dear ! "
159395	159401	159403	159404	the minister	1433	" Nay , Mistress Holt , "
159408	159497	159403	159404	the minister	1433	" enlarge not your grief by more than warrantable grounds . I have good hope that my young friend , your son , will be delivered from any severe consequences beyond the death of the man Tucker , which I fear will ever be a sore burden on his memory . I feel confident that a jury of His country - men will discern between misfortune , or it may be misjudgment , and an evil will , and that he will be acquitted of any grave offence . "
159498	159510	159512	159513	Mrs. Holt	205	" He never stole anything in his life , Mr. Lyon , "
159517	159741	159512	159513	Mrs. Holt	205	" Nobody can throw it in my face as my son ran away with money like the young man at the bank though he looked most respectable , and far different on a Sunday to what Felix ever did . And I know it 's very hard fighting with constables ; but they say Tucker 's wife'll be a deal better off than she was before , for the great folks'll pension her , and she 'll be put on all the charities , and her children at the Free School , and everything . Your trouble 's easy borne when everybody gives it a lift for you ; and if judge and jury wants to do right by Felix , they 'll think of his poor mother , with the bread took out of her mouth , all but half - a - crown a - week and furniture which , to be sure , is most excellent , and of my own buying and got to keep this orphin child as Felix himself brought on me . And I might send him back to his old grandfather on parish pay , but I 'm not that woman , Mr. Lyon ; I 've a tender heart . And here 's his little feet and toes , like marbil ; do but look "
159762	159909	159743	159744	Mrs. Holt	205	" and you 'll perhaps say I might take a lodger ; but it 's easy talking ; it is n't everybody at a loose - end wants a parlor and a bedroom ; and if anything bad happens to Felix , I may as well go and sit in the parish pound , and nobody to buy me out ; for it 's beyond everything how the church members find fault with my son . But I think they might leave his mother to find fault ; for queer and masterful he might be , and flying in the face of the very Scripture about the physic , but he was most clever beyond anything that I will say and was his own father 's lawful child , and me his mother , that was Mary Wall thirty years before ever I married his father . "
159931	159990	159923	159923	she	205	" And if they 're to transport him , I should like to go to the prison and take the orphin child ; for he was most fond of having him on his lap , and said he 'd never marry ; and there was One above overheard him , for he 's been took at his word . "
160240	160243	160234	160234	He	208	" the cause "
160336	160344	160346	160347	Mr. Muscat	219	" turn it which way you would , "
160733	160736	160721	160721	he	4454	" the cause "
161084	161099	161101	161101	Esther	214	" Then he is not so much cast down as you feared , father ? "
161103	161215	161101	161101	Esther	214	" No , child ; albeit he is pale and much shaken for one so stalwart . He hath no grief , he says , save for the poor man Tucker , and for his mother ; otherwise his heart is without a burden . We discoursed greatly on the sad effect of all this for his mother , and on the perplexed condition of human things , whereby even right action seems to bring evil consequences , if we have respect only to our own brief lives , and not to that larger rule whereby we are stewards of the eternal dealings , and not contrivers of our own success . "
161216	161226	161228	161228	Esther	214	" Did he say nothing about me , father ? "
161241	161339	161101	161101	Esther	214	" Yes ; he asked if you were well , and sent his affectionate regards . Nay , he bade me say something which appears to refer to your discourse together when I was not present . ' Tell her , ' he said , ' whatever they sentence me to , she knows they ca n't rob me of my vocation . With poverty for my bride , and preaching and pedagoguy for my business , I am sure of a handsome establishment . ' He laughed doubtless bearing in 313 mind some playfulness of thine . "
161791	161827	161761	161761	He	208	" a young Ishmaelite , whom he would fain see brought back from the lawless life of the desert , and seated in the same fold even with the sons of Judah and of Benjamin , "
161921	161926	161943	161945	more influential hearers	4519	" given in to , "
162332	162357	162326	162327	Mr. Lyon	208	" This , then , is what the man named Christian referred to . I distrusted him , yet it seems he spoke truly . "
162358	162361	162363	162363	Esther	214	" But , "
162380	162411	162363	162363	Esther	214	" Do they mean that the Transomes would be turned out of Transome Court , and that I should go and live there ? It seems quite an impossible thing . "
162412	162486	162363	162363	Esther	214	" Nay , child , I know not . I am ignorant in these things , and the thought of worldly grandeur for you hath more of terror than of gladness for me . Nevertheless we must duly weigh all things , not considering aught that befalls us as a bare event , but rather as an occasion for faithful stewardship . Let us go to my study and consider this writing further . "
163792	163852	163777	163777	she	214	" That is clearly your destiny to be aristocratic , to be rich . I always saw 318 that our lots lay widely apart . You are not fit for poverty , or any work of difficulty . But remember what I once said to you about a vision of consequences ; take care where your fortune leads you . "
164110	164118	164120	164120	Esther	214	" Yes , Lyddy , we come , "
164127	164142	164150	164150	Esther	214	" Is there any advice you have in your mind for me , father ? "
164181	164253	164171	164171	she	214	" Not yet , my dear save this ; that you will seek special illumination in this juncture , and , above all , be watchful that your soul be not lifted up within you by what , rightly considered , is rather an increase of charge , and a call upon you to walk along a path which is indeed easy to the flesh , but dangerous to the spirit . "
164254	164264	164265	164265	Esther	214	" You would always live with me , father ? "
164438	164482	164435	164435	He	1520	" Touch not that chord yet , my child . I must learn to think of thy lot according to the demands of Providence . We will rest a while from the subject ; and I will seek calmness in my ordinary duties . "
164601	164608	164610	164611	a lady	1161	" all sorts of fine liveries , "
164634	164650	164652	164653	Mrs. Holt	205	" If it 's Mr. Transome or somebody else as is great , Mr. Lyon , "
164655	164762	164652	164653	Mrs. Holt	205	" you 'll remember my son , and say he 's got a mother with a character they may enquire into as much as they like . And never mind what Felix says , for he 's so masterful he 'd stay in prison and be transported whether or no , only to have his own way . For it 's not to be thought but what the great people could get him off if they would ; and it 's very hard with a King in the country and all the texts in Proverbs about the King 's countenance , and Solomon and the live baby "
165168	165182	165183	165184	Mrs. Transome	269	" You must be astonished at a visit from me , Miss Lyon , "
165187	165228	165183	165184	Mrs. Transome	269	" I seldom come to Treby Magna . Now I see you , the visit is an unexpected pleasure ; but the cause of my coming is business of a serious nature , which my son will communicate to you . "
165229	165253	165255	165255	Harold	269	" I ought to begin by saying that what I have to announce to you is the reverse of disagreeable , Miss Lyon , "
165261	165285	165286	165286	Harold	269	" I do n't suppose the world would consider it very good news for me ; but a rejected candidate , Mr. Lyon , "
165296	165306	165286	165286	Harold	269	" begins to be inured to loss and misfortune . "
165308	165313	165315	165316	Mr. Lyon	208	" Truly , sir , "
165324	165346	165315	165316	Mr. Lyon	208	" your allusion hath a grievous bearing for me , but I will not retard your present purpose by further remark . "
165347	165358	165360	165360	Harold	269	" You will never guess what I have to disclose , "
165367	165382	165360	165360	Harold	269	" unless , indeed , you have already had some previous intimation of it . "
165383	165392	165394	165394	Esther	214	" Does it refer to law and inheritance ? "
165432	165441	165443	165443	Harold	269	" Then you have already heard of it ? "
165456	165460	165462	165462	Esther	214	" Only yesterday , "
165467	165489	165462	165462	Esther	214	" I received a letter from some lawyers with a statement of many surprising things , showing that I was an heiress "
165499	165521	165491	165491	she	214	" which , as you may imagine , is one of the last things I could have supposed myself to be . "
165522	165526	165528	165529	Mrs. Transome	269	" My dear , "
165545	165556	165528	165529	Mrs. Transome	269	" it is a lot that would become you admirably . "
165564	165589	165557	165557	Esther	214	" Oh , I know what to buy with fifty pounds a - year , but I know the price of nothing beyond that . "
165625	165631	165633	165633	Harold	269	" I daresay , then , "
165635	165682	165633	165633	Harold	269	" you are more fully possessed of particulars than I am . So that my mother and I need only tell you what no one else can tell you that is , what are her and my feelings and wishes under these new and unexpected circumstances . "
165683	165689	165691	165691	Esther	214	" I am most anxious , "
165703	165730	165731	165732	Mrs. Transome	269	" most anxious on that point . Indeed , being of course in uncertainty about it , I have not yet known whether I could rejoice . "
165746	165751	165752	165752	she	269	" Our chief anxiety , "
165763	165790	165752	165752	she	269	" is , that there may be no contest , no useless expenditure of money . Of course we will surrender what can be rightfully claimed . "
165791	165802	165804	165804	Harold	269	" My mother expresses our feeling precisely , Miss Lyon , "
165806	165821	165804	165804	Harold	269	" And I 'm sure , Mr. Lyon , you will understand our desire . "
165823	165911	165804	165804	Harold	269	" Assuredly , sir . My daughter would in any case have had my advice to seek a conclusion which would involve no strife . We endeavor , sir , in our body , to hold to the apostolic rule that one Christian brother should not go to law with another ; and I , for my part , would extend this rule to all my fellow - men , apprehending that the practice of our courts is little consistent with the simplicity that is in Christ . "
165912	165922	165924	165924	Esther	214	" If it is to depend on my will , "
165926	165970	165924	165924	Esther	214	" there is nothing that would be more repugnant to me than any struggle on such a subject . But ca n't the lawyers go on doing what they will in spite of me ? It seems that this is what they mean . "
165971	165975	165977	165977	Harold	269	" Not exactly , "
165981	166040	165977	165977	Harold	269	" Of course they live by such struggles as you dislike . But we can thwart them by determining not to quarrel . It is desirable that we should consider the affair together , and put it into the hands of honorable solicitors . I assure you we Transomes will not contend for what is not our own . "
166041	166054	166056	166057	Mrs. Transome	269	" And this is what I have come to beg of you , "
166059	166142	166056	166057	Mrs. Transome	269	" It is that you will come to Transome Court and let us take full time to arrange matters . Do oblige me : you shall not be teased more than you like by an old woman : you shall do just as you please , and become acquainted with your future home , since it is to be yours . I can tell you a world of things that you will want to know ; and the business can proceed properly . "
166143	166147	166149	166149	Harold	269	" Do consent , "
166228	166244	166246	166246	Harold	269	" I hope you do not disapprove of Miss Lyon 's granting us this favor ? "
166251	166275	166246	166246	Harold	269	" I have nothing to oppose to it , sir , if my daughter 's own mind is clear as to her course . "
166276	166284	166286	166287	Mrs. Transome	269	" You will come now with us , "
166291	166303	166286	166287	Mrs. Transome	269	" You will go back with us now in the carriage . "
166473	166481	166482	166482	she	214	" Since my father has no objection , "
166485	166506	166482	166482	she	214	" and you urge me so kindly . But I must beg for time to pack up a few clothes . "
166507	166512	166514	166515	Mrs. Transome	269	" By all means , "
166517	166525	166514	166515	Mrs. Transome	269	" We are not at all pressed . "
166536	166578	166533	166533	Harold	269	" Apart from our immediate reason for coming , Mr. Lyon , I could have wished to see you about these unhappy consequences of the election contest . But you will understand that I have been much preoccupied with private affairs . "
166579	166663	166533	166533	Harold	269	" You have well said that the consequences are unhappy , sir . And but for a reliance on something more than human calculation , I know not which I should most bewail the scandal which wrong - dealing has brought on right principles or the snares which it laid for the feet of a young man who is dear to me . ' One soweth , and another reapeth , ' is a verity that applies to evil as well as good . "
166664	166776	166533	166533	Harold	269	" You are referring to Felix Holt . I have not neglected steps to secure the best legal help for the prisoners : but I am given to understand that Holt refuses any aid from me . I hope he will not go rashly to work in speaking in his own defence without any legal instruction . It is an opprobrium of our law that no counsel is allowed to plead for the prisoner in cases of felony . A ready tongue may do a man as much harm as good in a court of justice . He piques himself on making a display , and displays a little too much . "
166777	166785	166787	166789	the little minister	4454	" Sir , you know him not , "
166796	166871	166787	166789	the little minister	4454	" He would not accept , even if it were accorded , a defense wherein the truth was screened or avoided , not from a vainglorious spirit of self - exhibition , for he hath a singular directness and simplicity of speech ; but from an averseness to a profession wherein a man may without shame seek to justify the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him . "
166872	166918	166533	166533	Harold	269	" It 's a pity a fine young fellow should do himself harm by fanatical notions of that sort . I could at least have procured the advantage of 324 first - rate consultation . He did n't look to me like a dreamy personage . "
166919	166935	166787	166789	the little minister	4454	" Nor is he dreamy ; rather , his excess lies in being too practical . "
166936	166980	166533	166533	Harold	269	" Well , I hope you will not encourage him in such irrationality ; the question is not one of misrepresentation , but of adjusting fact , so as to raise it to the power of evidence . Do n't you see that ? "
166981	167267	166787	166789	the little minister	4454	" I do , I do . But I distrust not Felix Holt 's discernment in regard to his own case . He builds not on doubtful things and hath no illusory hopes ; on the contrary , he is of a too - scornful incredulity where I would fain see a more childlike faith . But he will hold no belief without action corresponding thereto ; and the occasion of his return to this , his native place , at a time which has proved fatal , was no other than his resolve to hinder the sale of some drugs , which had chiefly supported his mother , but which his better knowledge showed him to be pernicious to the human frame . He undertook to support her by his own labor ; but , sir , I pray you to mark and old as I am , I will not deny that this young man instructs me herein I pray you to mark the poisonous confusion of good and evil which is the wide - spreading effect of vicious practices . Through the use of undue electioneering means concerning which , however , I do not accuse you farther than of having acted the part of him who washes his hands when he delivers up to others the exercise of an iniquitous power Felix Holt is , I will not scruple to say , the innocent victim of a riot ; and that deed of strict honesty , whereby he took on himself the charge of his aged mother , seems now to have deprived her of sufficient bread , and is even an occasion of reproach to him from the weaker brethren . "
167268	167283	167285	167285	Harold	269	" I shall be proud to supply her as amply as you think desirable , "
167292	167348	166787	166789	the little minister	4454	" I will pray you to speak of this question with my daughter , who , it appears , may herself have large means at command , and would desire to minister to Mrs. Holt 's needs with all friendship and delicacy . For the present I can take care that she lacks nothing essential . "
167377	167392	167365	167365	She	214	" You will let my pupils know at once , will you , father ? "
167393	167399	167401	167403	the old man	1479	" Doubtless , my dear , "
167466	167476	167478	167478	Harold	269	" If you are quite ready , Miss Lyon , "
167494	167509	167478	167478	Harold	269	" I will take my mother to the carriage and come back for you . "
167528	167553	167520	167520	her	214	" This will not be a grief to you , I hope , father ? You think it is better that I should go ? "
167554	167612	167520	167520	her	214	" Nay , child , I am weak . But I would fain be capable of a joy quite apart from the accidents of my aged earthly existence , which , indeed , is a petty and almost dried - up fountain whereas to the receptive soul the river of life pauses not , nor is diminished . "
167613	167626	167520	167520	her	214	" Perhaps you will see Felix Holt again and tell him all ? "
167627	167637	167520	167520	her	214	" Shall I say aught to him for you ? "
167638	167658	167660	167660	Esther	214	" Oh , no ; only that Job Tudge has a little flannel shirt and a box of lozenges , "
167664	167692	167660	167660	Esther	214	" Ah , I hear Mr. Transome coming back . I must say good - bye to Lyddy , else she will cry over my hard heart . "
168072	168076	168047	168047	She	214	" Come in . "
168399	168409	168394	168394	her	269	" So you 're come at last , Denner ? "
168410	168431	168394	168394	her	269	" Yes , madam ; it is not late . I 'm sorry you should have undone your hair yourself . "
168432	168461	168394	168394	her	269	" I undid it to see what an old hag I am . These fine clothes you put on me , Denner , are only a smart shroud . "
168462	168615	168394	168394	her	269	" Pray do n't talk so , madam . If there 's anybody does n't think it pleasant to look at you , so much the worse for them . For my part , I 've seen no young ones fit to hold up your train . Look at your likeness down 327 below ; and though you 're older now , what signifies ? I would n't be Letty in the scullery because she 's got red cheeks . She may n't know she 's a poor creature , but I know it , and that 's enough for me ; I know what sort of a dowdy draggletail she 'll be in ten years ' time . I would change with nobody , madam . And if troubles were put up to market , I 'd sooner buy old than new . It 's something to have seen the worst . "
168616	168631	168633	168634	Mrs. Transome	269	" A woman never has seen the worst till she is old , Denner , "
168703	168707	168709	168709	Jermyn	173	" none so fond "
168823	168844	168845	168845	she	162	" If there 's anything worse coming to you , I should like to know what it is , madam , "
168870	168911	168845	168845	she	162	" When I awake at cock - crow , I 'd sooner have one real grief on my mind than twenty false . It 's better to know one 's robbed than to think one 's going to be murdered . "
168912	168970	168845	168845	she	162	" I believe you are the creature in the world that loves me best , Denner ; yet you will never understand what I suffer . It 's of no use telling you . There 's no folly in you , and no heartache . You are made of iron . You have never had any trouble . "
168971	168982	168845	168845	she	162	" I 've had some of your trouble , madam . "
168983	169010	168845	168845	she	162	" Yes , you good thing . But as a sick - nurse , that never caught the fever . You never even had a child . "
169011	169091	168845	168845	she	162	" I can feel for things I never went through . I used to be sorry for the poor French Queen when I was young ; I 'd have lain cold for her to lie warm . I know people have feelings according to their birth and station . And you always took things to heart , madam , beyond anybody else . 328 But I hope there 's nothing new , to make you talk of the worst . "
169092	169102	169104	169105	Mrs. Transome	269	" Yes , Denner , there is there is , "
169128	169135	168845	168845	she	162	" Is it this young lady ? "
169136	169148	169150	169151	Mrs. Transome	269	" Why , what do you think about her , Denner ? "
169171	169270	168845	168845	she	162	" I do n't deny she 's graceful , and she has a pretty smile and very good manners : it 's quite unaccountable by what Banks says about her father . I know nothing of those Treby townsfolk myself , but for my part I 'm puzzled . I 'm fond of Mr. Harold . I always shall be , madam . I was at his bringing into the world , and nothing but his doing wrong by you would turn me against him . But the servants all say he 's in love with Miss Lyon . "
169271	169280	169282	169283	Mrs. Transome	269	" I wish it were true , Denner , "
169287	169312	169282	169283	Mrs. Transome	269	" I wish he were in love with her , so that she could master him , and make him do what she pleased . "
169313	169323	168845	168845	she	162	" Then it is not true what they say ? "
169324	169461	169282	169283	Mrs. Transome	269	" Not true that she will ever master him . No woman ever will . He will make her fond of him , and afraid of him . That 's one of the things you have never gone through , Denner . A woman 's love is always freezing into fear . She wants everything , she is secure of nothing . This girl has a fine spirit plenty of fire and pride and wit . Men like such captives , as they like horses that champ the bit and paw the ground : they feel more triumph in their mastery . What is the use of a woman 's will ? if she tries , she does n't get it , and she ceases to be loved . God was cruel when He made women . "
169541	169553	169554	169554	she	269	" It may n't be good luck to be a woman , "
169557	169629	169630	169630	she	269	" But one begins with it from a baby : one gets used to it . And I should n't like to be a man to cough so loud , and stand straddling about on a wet day , and be so wasteful with meat and drink . They 're a coarse lot , I think . Then I 329 need n't make a trouble of this young lady , madam , "
169639	169702	169630	169630	she	269	" No , Denner , I like her . If that were all I should like Harold to marry her . It would be the best thing . If the truth were known and it will be known soon the estate is hers by law such law as it is . It 's a strange story : she 's a Bycliffe really . "
169721	169771	169719	169719	she	162	" Well , madam , I was sure there was something wonderful at the bottom of it . And turning the old lawsuits and everything else over in my mind , I thought the law might have something to do with it . Then she is a born lady ? "
169772	169783	169719	169719	she	162	" Yes ; she has good blood in her veins . "
169784	169892	169719	169719	she	162	" We talked that over in the housekeeper 's room what a hand and an instep she has , and how her head is set on her shoulders almost like your own , madam . But her lightish complexion spoils her , to my thinking . And Dominic said Mr. Harold never admired that sort of woman before . There 's nothing that smooth fellow could n't tell you if he would : he knows the answer to riddles before they 're made . However , he knows how to hold his tongue ; I 'll say that for him . And so do I , madam . "
169893	169912	169719	169719	she	162	" Yes , yes ; you will not talk of it till other people are talking of it . "
169913	169931	169719	169719	she	162	" And so , if Mr. Harold married her , it would save all fuss and mischief ? "
169932	169938	169719	169719	she	162	" Yes about the estate . "
169939	169975	169719	169719	she	162	" And he seems inclined ; and she 'll not refuse him , I 'll answer for it . And you like her , madam . There 's everything to set your mind at rest . "
170024	170031	170032	170033	Mrs. Transome	269	" I am not at rest ! "
170138	170141	170142	170142	she	269	" Denner , "
170150	170170	170142	170142	she	269	" if I could choose at this moment , I would choose that Harold should never have been born . "
170171	170177	170178	170178	Denner	162	" Nay , my dear , "
170187	170190	170142	170142	she	269	" my dear "
170195	170204	170142	170142	she	269	" it was a happiness to you then . "
170205	170285	170178	170178	Denner	162	" I do n't believe I felt the happiness then as I feel the misery now . It is foolish to say people ca n't feel much when they are getting old . Not pleasure , perhaps little comes . But they can feel they are forsaken why , every fibre in me seems to be a memory that makes a pang . They can feel that all the love in their lives is turned to hatred or contempt . "
170286	170322	170142	170142	she	269	" Not mine , madam , not mine . Let what would be I should want to live for your sake , for fear you should have nobody to do for you as I would . "
170323	170356	170178	170178	Denner	162	" Ah , then you are a happy woman , Denner ; you have loved somebody for forty years who is old and weak now , and ca n't do without you . "
170380	170401	170402	170403	Henry IV	402	" She 's beautiful ; and therefore to be wooed : She is a woman ; therefore to be won . "
170570	170573	170575	170575	he	402	" Gappa , "
170760	170763	170755	170756	Mr. Transome	144	" Gappa , "
170986	170996	170998	170998	Gappa	498	" He can talk well enough if he likes , "
171016	171021	171022	171022	he	498	" You mind him , "
171037	171071	171022	171022	he	498	" You 'll hear : he knows the right names of things well enough , but he likes to make his own . He 'll give you one all to yourself before long . "
171088	171091	171074	171074	Harry	144	" Boo , "
171122	171125	171120	171121	Mrs. Transome	269	" Gamma , "
171128	171131	171120	171121	Mrs. Transome	269	" Bite . "
171133	171138	171140	171140	he	144	" It 's wonderful ! "
172322	172335	172314	172315	Mrs. Transome	484	" My dear , you make me wish I had a daughter ! "
173179	173186	173158	173158	he	4710	" making a bed for her cheek "
173492	173499	173500	173500	he	144	" Do n't move , pray , "
173505	173518	173500	173500	he	144	" you look as if you were standing for your own portrait . "
173519	173527	173529	173529	Esther	214	" I take that as an insinuation , "
173545	173598	173529	173529	Esther	214	" for I notice almost all the portraits are in a conscious , affected attitude . That fair Lady Betty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture , and had not will enough of her own ever to move again unless she had a little push given to her . "
173599	173612	173614	173614	Harold	144	" She brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt , "
173621	173636	173614	173614	Harold	144	" but alive I dare say she would have 337 been less cheerful company . "
173637	173659	173661	173661	Esther	214	" One would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver paper . Ah , how chivalrous you are ! "
173953	173957	173959	173959	Esther	214	" I wonder , "
173970	174019	173965	173965	her	214	" I wonder whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any troubles . I see there are two old ones up - stairs in the billiard - room who have only got fat ; the expression of their faces is just of the same sort . "
174020	174080	173965	173965	her	214	" A woman ought never to have any trouble . There should always be a man to guard her from it . Harold Transome was masculine and fallible ; he had incautiously sat down this morning to pay his addresses by talk about nothing in particular ; and , clever experienced man as he was , he fell into nonsense .
174081	174102	174104	174104	Esther	214	" But suppose the man himself got into trouble you would wish her to mind about that . Or suppose , "
174114	174121	174104	174104	Esther	214	" the man himself was troublesome ? "
174122	174147	173965	173965	her	214	" Oh , you must not strain probabilities in that way . The generality of men are perfect . Take me , for example . "
174148	174157	174159	174159	Esther	214	" You are a perfect judge of sauces , "
174177	174188	173965	173965	her	214	" That is perfection number one . Pray go on . "
174189	174218	173965	173965	her	214	" Oh , the catalogue is too long I should be tired before I got to your magnificent ruby ring and your gloves always of the right color . "
174219	174236	173965	173965	her	214	" If you would let me tell you your perfections , I should not be tired . "
174237	174251	173965	173965	her	214	" That is not complimentary ; it means that the list is short . "
174252	174266	173965	173965	her	214	" No ; it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon . "
174267	174273	174275	174275	Esther	214	" Pray do n't begin , "
174285	174318	174275	174275	Esther	214	" it would be dangerous to our good understanding . The person I liked best in the world was one who did nothing but scold me and tell me of my faults . "
174440	174448	174450	174450	Harold	144	" You speak in the past tense , "
174455	174496	174450	174450	Harold	144	" yet I am rather envious of that person . I shall never be able to win your regard in the same way . Is it anyone at Treby ? Because in that case I can enquire about your faults . "
174497	174510	174512	174512	Esther	214	" Oh , you know I have always lived among grave people , "
174525	174606	174512	174512	Esther	214	" Before I came home to be with my father I was nothing but a school - girl first , and then a teacher in different stages of growth . People in those circumstances are not usually flattered . But there are varieties in fault - finding . At our Paris school the master I liked best was an old man who stormed at me terribly when I read Racine , but yet showed that he was proud of me . "
174640	174653	174654	174654	he	144	" That must have been a wretched life for you at Treby , "
174656	174663	174654	174654	he	144	" a person of your accomplishments . "
174664	174672	174674	174674	Esther	214	" I used to be dreadfully discontented , "
174687	174715	174674	174674	Esther	214	" But I was becoming less so . I have had time to get rather wise , you know ; I am two - and - twenty . "
174716	174719	174721	174721	Harold	144	" Yes , "
174733	174751	174721	174721	Harold	144	" you are past your majority ; you are empress of your own fortunes and more besides . "
174752	174756	174758	174758	Esther	214	" Dear me , "
174772	174788	174758	174758	Esther	214	" I do n't think I know very well what to do with my empire . "
174789	174792	174794	174794	Harold	144	" Well , "
174814	174892	174794	174794	Harold	144	" I hope that in any case , since you appear to have no near relative who understands affairs , you will confide in me , and trust me with all your intentions as if I had no other personal concern in the matter than a regard for you . I hope you believe me capable of acting as the guardian of your interest , even where it turns out to be inevitably opposed to my own . "
174893	174906	174908	174908	Esther	214	" I am sure you have given me reason to believe it , "
175005	175016	175017	175017	he	144	" I see you have made mistakes in your work , "
175036	175045	175047	175047	Esther	214	" Nonsense ! you know nothing about it , "
175061	175070	175047	175047	Esther	214	" Those blunders have a design in them . "
175137	175155	175123	175123	he	144	" I am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that I ca n't guess . "
175156	175165	175167	175167	Esther	214	" Pray do n't speak of my wishes , "
175181	175206	175207	175207	she	214	" I could not possibly tell you one at this moment I think I shall never find them out again . Oh , yes , "
175222	175258	175207	175207	she	214	" I do know one wish distinctly . I want to go and see my father . He writes me word that all is well with him , but still I want to see him . "
175259	175269	175318	175318	He	4744	" You shall be driven there when you like . "
175270	175284	175286	175286	Esther	214	" May I go now I mean as soon as it is convenient ? "
175290	175303	175305	175305	Harold	144	" I will give the order immediately , if you wish it , "
175331	175371	175318	175318	He	4744	" quality not high ' Twill lose its color opened to the sun , Has no aroma , and , in fine , is naught I barter not for such commodities There is no ratio betwixt sands and gems . "
175598	175602	175554	175554	him	4454	" the little horn "
175623	175635	175637	175637	Esther	214	" You will not like me to interrupt you , father ? "
175641	175648	175649	175649	he	4454	" Ah , my beloved child ! "
175681	175724	175671	175671	Esther	214	" Thy appearing is as a joy despaired of . I had thought of thee as the blinded think of the daylight which indeed is a thing to rejoice in , like all other good , though we see it not nigh . "
175725	175745	175747	175747	Esther	214	" Are you sure you have been as well and comfortable as you said you were in your letters ? "
175765	175837	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" I wrote truly , my dear , according to my knowledge at the time . But to an old memory like mine the present days are but as a little water poured on the deep . It seems now that all has been as usual , except my studies , which have gone somewhat curiously into prophetic history . But I fear you will rebuke me for my negligent apparel , "
175858	175921	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" That is Lyddy 's fault , who sits crying over her want of Christian assurance instead of brushing your clothes and putting out your clean cravat . She is always saying her righteousness is filthy rags , and really I do n't think that is a very strong expression for it . I 'm sure it is dusty clothes and furniture . "
175922	175992	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" Nay , my dear , your playfulness glances too severely on our faithful Lyddy . Doubtless I am myself deficient , in that I do not aid her infirm memory by admonition . But now tell me aught that you have left untold about yourself . Your heart has gone out somewhat toward this family the old man and the child , whom I had not reckoned of ? "
175993	176022	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" Yes , father . It is more and more difficult to me to see how I can make up my mind to disturb these people at all . "
176023	176069	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" Something should doubtless be devised to lighten the loss and the change to the aged father and mother . I would have you in any case seek to temper a vicissitude , which is nevertheless a providential arrangement not to be wholly set aside . "
176070	176100	175839	175841	the little man	1497	" Do you think , father do you feel assured that a case of inheritance like this of mine is a sort of providential arrangement that makes a command ? "
176101	176108	176110	176111	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have so held it , "
176115	176193	176110	176111	Mr. Lyon	208	" in all my meditations I have so held it . For you have to consider , my dear , that you have 342 been led by a peculiar path , and into experience which is not ordinarily the lot of those who are seated in high places , and what I have hinted to you already in my letters on this head , I shall wish on a future opportunity to enter into more at large . "
176250	176271	176238	176238	She	214	" Have you been again to see Felix Holt , father ? You have not mentioned him in your letters . "
176272	176335	176238	176238	She	214	" I have been since I last wrote , my dear , and I took his mother with me , who , I fear , made the time heavy to him with her plaints . But afterward I carried her away to the house of a brother minister at Loamford , and returned to Felix , and then we had much discourse . "
176336	176354	176238	176238	She	214	" Did you tell him of everything that has happened I mean about me about the Transomes ? "
176355	176459	176238	176238	She	214	" Assuredly I told him , and he listened as one astonished . For he had much to hear , knowing naught of your birth , and that you had any other father than Rufus Lyon . ' Tis a narrative I trust I shall not be called on to give to others ; but I was not without satisfaction in unfolding the truth to this young man , who hath wrought himself into my affection strangely I would fain hope for ends that will be a visible good in his less way - worn life , when mine shall be no longer . "
176460	176480	176238	176238	She	214	" And you told him how the Transomes had come , and that I was staying at Transome Court ? "
176481	176506	176238	176238	She	214	" Yes , I told these things with some particularity , as is my wo nt concerning what hath imprinted itself on my mind . "
176507	176513	176238	176238	She	214	" What did Felix say ? "
176514	176525	176527	176528	Mr. Lyon	208	" Truly , my dear , nothing desirable to recite , "
176537	176563	176238	176238	She	214	" Dear father , he did say something , and you always remember what people say . Pray tell me ; I want to know . "
176564	176597	176238	176238	She	214	" It was a hasty remark , and rather escaped him than was consciously framed . He said , ' Then she will marry Transome ; that is what Transome means . ' "
176598	176603	176605	176605	Esther	214	" That was all ? "
176625	176820	176238	176238	She	214	" Yes , we did not go further into that branch of the subject . I apprehend there is no warrant for his seeming prognostic , and I should not be 343 without disquiet if I thought otherwise . For I confess that in your accession to this great position and property , I contemplate with hopeful satisfaction your remaining attached to that body of congregational Dissent , which , as I hold , hath retained most of pure and primitive discipline . Your education and peculiar history would thus be seen to have coincided with a long train of events in making this family property a means of honoring and illustrating a purer form of Christianity than that which hath unhappily obtained the pre - eminence in this land . I speak , my child , as you know , always in the hope that you will fully join our communion ; and this dear wish of my heart nay , this urgent prayer would seem to be frustrated by your marriage with a man , of whom there is at least no visible indication that he would unite himself to our body . "
176845	176849	176837	176838	her father	1520	" joining the church "
177127	177142	177143	177143	he	1520	" Have you yet spoken with Mr. Transome concerning Mrs. Holt , my dear ? "
177154	177172	177143	177143	he	1520	" I hinted to him that you would best decide how assistance should be tendered to her . "
177173	177226	177147	177147	Esther	214	" No , father , we have not approached the subject . Mr. Transome may have forgotten it , and , for several reasons , I would rather not talk of this of money matters to him at present . There is money due to me from the Lukyns and the Pendrells . "
177227	177233	177235	177236	Mr. Lyon	208	" They have paid it , "
177242	177253	177235	177236	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have it here ready to deliver to you . "
177254	177286	177288	177288	Esther	214	" Keep it , father , and pay Mrs. Holt 's rent with it , and do anything else that is wanted for her . We must consider everything temporary now , "
177319	177339	177340	177340	she	214	" Everything is uncertain what may become of Felix what may become of us all . Oh , dear ! "
177350	177362	177340	177340	she	214	" I am beginning to talk like Lyddy , I think . "
177363	177366	177368	177369	Mr. Lyon	208	" Truly , "
177373	177424	177368	177369	Mr. Lyon	208	" the uncertainty of things is a text rather too wide and obvious for fruitful application ; and to discourse of it is , as one may say , to bottle up the air , and make a present of it to those who are already standing out of doors . "
177425	177430	177432	177432	Esther	214	" Do you think , "
177441	177459	177432	177432	Esther	214	" that the Treby people know at all about the reasons of my being at Transome Court ? "
177460	177645	177368	177369	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have had no sign thereof : and indeed there is no one , as it appears , who could make the story public . The man Christian is away in London with Mr. Debarry , Parliament now beginning ; and Mr. Jermyn would doubtless respect the confidence of the Transomes . I have not seen him lately . I know nothing of his movements . And so far as my own speech is concerned , and my strict command to Lyddy , I have withheld the means of information even as to your having returned to Transome Court in the carriage , not wishing to give any occasion to solicitous questioning till time hath somewhat inured me . But it hath got abroad that you are there , and is the subject of conjectures , whereof , I imagine , the chief is , that you are gone as companion to Mistress Transome ; for some of our friends have already hinted a rebuke to me that I should permit your taking a position so little likely to further your spiritual welfare . "
177647	177672	177674	177674	Esther	214	" Now , father , I think I shall be obliged to run away from you , not to keep the carriage too long , "
177687	177705	177674	177674	Esther	214	" You look beautiful now , and I must give Lyddy a little lecture before I go . "
177706	177788	177789	177789	Esther	214	" Yes , my dear ; I would not detain you , seeing that my duties demand me . But take with you this Treatise , which I have purposely selected . It concerns all the main questions between ourselves and the Establishment government , discipline , state - support . It is seasonable that you should give a nearer attention to these polemics , lest you be drawn aside by the fallacious association of a State Church with elevated rank . "
179462	179469	179470	179470	she	269	" Harold has gone to Loamford , "
179478	179488	179470	179470	she	269	" You had something particular to say to me ? "
179489	179492	179494	179494	Jermyn	173	" Yes , "
179503	179540	179494	179494	Jermyn	173	" The last time I was here I could not take the opportunity of speaking to you . But I am anxious to know whether you are aware of what has passed between me and Harold ? "
179541	179550	179470	179470	she	269	" Yes , he has told me everything . "
179551	179565	179494	179494	Jermyn	173	" About his proceedings against me ? and the reason he stopped them ? "
179566	179580	179470	179470	she	269	" Yes : have you had notice that he has begun them again ? "
179581	179584	179586	179586	Jermyn	173	" No , "
179594	179601	179603	179604	Mrs. Transome	269	" Of course he will now , "
179606	179619	179603	179604	Mrs. Transome	269	" There is no reason in his mind why he should not . "
179620	179630	179470	179470	she	269	" Has he resolved to risk the estate then ? "
179632	179668	179470	179470	she	269	" He feels in no danger on that score . And if there were , the danger does n't depend on you . The most likely thing is , that he will marry this girl . "
179669	179675	179677	179677	Jermyn	173	" He knows everything then ? "
179687	179723	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" Everything . It 's of no use for you to think of mastering him : you ca n't do it . I used to wish Harold to be fortunate , and he is fortunate , "
179732	179742	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" It 's not my star that he inherits . "
179743	179757	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" Do you know how he came by the information about this girl ? "
179758	179777	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" No ; but she knew it all before we spoke to her . It 's no secret . "
179821	179833	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" You are aware that these chancery proceedings may ruin me ? "
179834	179938	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" He told me they would . But if you are imagining I can do anything , pray dismiss the notion . I have told him as plainly as I dare that I wish him to drop all public quarrel with you , and that you could make an arrangement without scandal . I can do no more . He will not listen to me ; he does n't mind about my feelings . He cares more for Mr. Transome than he does for me . He will not listen to me any more than if I were an old ballad - singer . "
179939	179950	179952	179952	Jermyn	173	" It 's very hard on me , I know , "
179966	179982	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" I besought you three months ago to bear anything rather than quarrel with him . "
179983	180027	179725	179726	Mrs. Transome	269	" I have not quarrelled with him . It is he who has been always seeking a quarrel with me . I have borne a great deal more than any one else would . He set his teeth against me from the first . "
180028	180043	180045	180046	Mrs. Transome	269	" He saw things that annoyed him ; and men are not like women , "
180056	180067	180069	180069	Jermyn	173	" It 's very hard on me I know that , "
180100	180170	180091	180091	his	173	" Of course the law in this case ca n't in the least represent the justice of the matter . I made a good many sacrifices in times past . I gave up a great deal of fine business for the sake of attending to the family affairs , 350 and in that lawsuit they would have gone to rack and ruin if it had n't been for me . "
180275	180394	180470	180471	Mrs. Transome	269	" I stretched my conscience a good deal in that affair of Bycliffe , as you know perfectly well . I told you everything at the time . I told you I was very uneasy about those witnesses , and about getting him thrown into prison . I know it 's the blackest thing anybody could charge me with , if they knew my life from beginning to end ; and I should never have done it , if I had not been under an infatuation such as makes a man do anything . What did it signify to me about the loss of the lawsuit ? I was a young bachelor I had the world before me . "
180395	180398	180400	180401	Mrs. Transome	269	" Yes , "
180408	180420	180400	180401	Mrs. Transome	269	" It was a pity you did n't make another choice . "
180421	180429	180431	180431	Jermyn	173	" What would have become of you ? "
180444	180464	180431	180431	Jermyn	173	" I had to think of you . You would not have liked me to make another choice then . "
180465	180468	180470	180471	Mrs. Transome	269	" Clearly , "
180481	180488	180470	180471	Mrs. Transome	269	" the greater mistake was mine . "
180524	180530	180531	180531	he	173	" I hardly see that , "
180541	180609	180531	180531	he	173	" You had an estate and a position to save , to go no farther . I remember very well what you said to me ' A clever lawyer can do anything if he has the will ; if it 's impossible , he will make it possible . And the property is sure to be Harold 's some day . ' He was a baby then . "
180610	180634	180773	180773	Jermyn	173	" I remember most things a little too well ; you had better say at once what is your object in recalling them . "
180635	180772	180531	180531	he	173	" An object that is nothing more than justice . With the relation I stood in , it was not likely I should think myself bound by all the forms that are made to bind strangers . I had often immense trouble to raise the 351 money necessary to pay off debts and carry on the affairs ; and , as I said before , I had given up other lines of advancement which would have been open to me if I had not stayed in this neighborhood at a critical time when I was fresh to the world . Anybody who knew the whole circumstances would say that my being hunted and run down on the score of my past transactions with regard to the family affairs , is an abominably unjust and unnatural thing . "
180782	180813	180773	180773	Jermyn	173	" At my time of life and with a family about me and after what has passed I should have thought there was nothing you would care more to prevent . "
180814	180835	180531	180531	he	173	" I do care . It makes me miserable . That is the extent of my power to feel miserable . "
180836	180876	180773	180773	Jermyn	173	" No , it is not the extent of your power . You could save me if you would . It is not to be supposed that Harold would go on against me if he knew the whole truth . "
181014	181021	181064	181064	she	269	" if he knew the whole truth "
181054	181063	181064	181064	she	269	" And you expect me to tell him ? "
181081	181092	181104	181104	he	173	" Would it not be right for him to know ? "
181139	181146	181148	181149	Mrs. Transome	269	" I will never tell him ! "
181198	181274	181178	181178	her	269	" You reckon up your sacrifices for me : you have kept a good account of them , and it is needful : they are some of them what no one else could guess or find out . But you made your sacrifices when they seemed pleasant to you ; when you told me they were your happiness ; when you told me that it was I who stooped , and I who bestowed favors . "
181302	181307	181308	181309	Mrs. Transome	269	" Do n't speak ! "
181313	181456	181308	181309	Mrs. Transome	269	" Do n't open your lips again . You have said enough ; I will speak now . I have made sacrifices too , but it was when I knew that they were not my happiness . It was after I saw that I had stooped after I saw that your tenderness had turned into calculation after I saw that you cared for yourself only , and not for me . I heard your explanations of your duty in life of our mutual reputation of a virtuous young lady attached to you . I bore it ; I let everything go ; I shut my eyes : I might almost have let myself starve , rather than have scenes of quarrel with the man I had loved , in which I must accuse him of turning my love into a good bargain . "
181497	181543	181481	181481	she	269	" I suppose if a lover picked one 's pocket , there 's no woman would like to own it . I do n't say I was not afraid of you : I was afraid of you , and I know now I was right . "
181544	181548	181550	181550	Jermyn	173	" Mrs. Transome , "
181557	181574	181550	181550	Jermyn	173	" it is needless to say more . I withdraw any words that have offended you . "
181575	181691	181481	181481	she	269	" You ca n't withdraw them . Can a man apologize for being a dastard ? And I have caused you to strain your conscience , have I ? it is I who have sullied your purity ? I should think the demons have more honor they are not so impudent to one another . I would not lose the misery of being a woman , now I see what can be the baseness of a man . One must be a man first to tell a woman that her love has made her your debtor , and then ask her to pay you by breaking the last poor threads between her and her son . "
181692	181699	181701	181701	Jermyn	173	" I do not ask it , "
181740	181842	181481	181481	she	269	" You do ask it : it is what you would like . I have had a terror on me lest evil should happen to you . From the first , after Harold came home , I had a terrible dread . It seemed as if murder might come between you I did n't know what . I felt the horror of his not knowing the truth . I might have been dragged at last , by my own feeling by my own memory to tell him all , and make him as well as myself miserable , to save you . "
181868	181911	181863	181863	she	5947	" But now you have asked me , I will never tell him ! Be ruined no do something more dastardly to save yourself . If I sinned , my judgment went beforehand that I should sin for a man like you . "
182714	182725	182699	182701	the old man	1479	" Mr. Jermyn ? why why where is Mrs. Transome ? "
183168	183172	183174	183174	Esther	214	" To him , "
183188	183210	183174	183174	Esther	214	" who has not had the sort of intercourse in which Felix Holt 's cultured nature would have asserted its superiority . "
183941	183958	183934	183934	she	214	" A woman must choose meaner things , because only meaner things are offered to her . "
184290	184296	184279	184280	Uncle Lingon	154	" no mischief of anybody , "

184815	184827	184829	184829	Harold	269	" What do you think about thinning the trees over there ? "
184836	184897	184829	184829	Harold	269	" I have a bit of a notion that if they were divided into clumps so as to show the oaks beyond it would be a great improvement . It would give an idea of extent that is lost now . And there might be some very pretty clumps got out of those mixed trees . What do you think ? "
184898	184926	184928	184928	Esther	214	" I should think it would be an improvement . One likes a ' beyond ' everywhere . But I never heard you express yourself so dubiously , "
184936	184976	184928	184928	Esther	214	" you generally see things so clearly , and are so convinced , that I shall begin to feel quite tottering if I find you in uncertainty . Pray do n't begin to be doubtful ; it is infectious . "
184977	184989	184991	184991	Harold	269	" You think me a great deal too sure too confident ? "
184993	185017	184928	184928	Esther	214	" Not at all . It is an immense advantage to know your own will , when you always mean to have it . "
185018	185032	185034	185034	Harold	269	" But suppose I could n't get it , in spite of meaning ? "
185044	185049	185051	185051	Esther	214	" Oh , then , "
185071	185104	185062	185062	she	214	" you would bear it quite easily , as you did your not getting into Parliament . You would know you could get it another time or get something else as good . "
185105	185110	185112	185112	Harold	269	" The fact is , "
185133	185147	185112	185112	Harold	269	" you consider me a fat , fatuous , self - satisfied fellow . "
185148	185155	185157	185157	Esther	214	" Oh , there are degrees , "
185164	185189	185157	185157	Esther	214	" you have just as much of those qualities as is becoming . There are different styles . You are perfect in your own . "
185190	185218	185112	185112	Harold	269	" But you prefer another style , I suspect . A more submissive , tearful , devout worshipper , who would offer his incense with more trembling . "
185219	185225	185227	185227	Esther	214	" You are quite mistaken , "
185232	185263	185227	185227	Esther	214	" I find I am very wayward . When anything is offered to me , it seems that I prize it less , and do n't want to have it . "
185300	185312	185313	185313	she	214	" I have often read that that is in human nature , "
185317	185331	185332	185332	she	214	" yet 360 it takes me by surprise in myself . I suppose , "
185337	185348	185332	185332	she	214	" I did n't think of myself as human nature . "
185349	185359	185361	185361	Harold	269	" I do n't confess to the same waywardness , "
185363	185460	185361	185361	Harold	269	" I am very fond of things that I can get . And I never longed much for anything out of my reach . Whatever I feel sure of getting I like all the better . I think half those priggish maxims about human nature in the lump are no more to be relied on than universal remedies . There are different sorts of human nature . Some are given to discontent and longing , others to securing and enjoying . And let me tell you , the discontented longing style is unpleasant to live with . "
185470	185484	185485	185485	she	214	" Oh , I assure you I have abjured all admiration for it , "
185716	185720	185729	185730	a woman	1009	" the people . "
185874	185881	185883	185884	the rector	1106	" But you know , lad , "
185894	186060	185883	185884	the rector	1106	" you ca n't do everything in a hurry . The wheat must have time to grow , even when you 've reformed all us old Tories off the face of the ground . Dash it ! now the election 's over , I 'm an old Tory again . You see , Harold , a Radical wo n't do for the county . At another election , you must be on the look - out for a borough where they want a bit of blood . I should have liked you uncommonly to stand for the county ; and a Radical of good family squares well enough with a new - fashioned Tory like young Debarry ; but you see , these riots it 's been a nasty business . I shall have my hair combed at the sessions for a year to come . But , heyday ! What dame is this , with a small boy ? not one of my parishioners ? "
186391	186400	186372	186372	Esther	214	" How do you do , Mrs. Holt ? "
186411	186420	186422	186423	Mrs. Holt	205	" Yes you know him , Miss Lyon , "
186443	186483	186422	186423	Mrs. Holt	205	" you know the orphin child , as Felix brought home for me that am his mother to take care of . And it 's what I 've done nobody more so though it 's trouble is my reward . "
186731	186742	186744	186744	Esther	214	" I hope Job 's cough has been better lately , "
186761	186772	186774	186775	Mrs. Holt	205	" I dare say you hope so , Miss Lyon , "
186783	186952	186774	186775	Mrs. Holt	205	" I 've no reason to disbelieve but what you wish well to the child , and to Felix , and to me . I 'm sure nobody has any occasion to wish me otherways . My character will bear enquiry , and what you , as are young , do n't know , others can tell you . That was what I said to myself when I made up my mind to come here and see you , and ask you to get me the freedom to speak to Mr. Transome . I said , whatever Miss Lyon may be now , in the way of being lifted up among great people , 363 she 's our minister 's daughter , and was not above coming to my house and walking with my son Felix though I 'll not deny he made that figure on the Lord 's Day , that 'll perhaps go against him with the judge , if anybody thinks well to tell him . "
187002	187018	186990	186990	he	144	" You are then the mother of the unfortunate young man who is in prison ? "
187019	187026	187028	187029	Mrs. Holt	205	" Indeed I am , sir , "
187040	187390	187028	187029	Mrs. Holt	205	" It 's not likely I should claim him if he was n't my own ; though it 's not by my will , nor my advice , sir , that he ever walked ; for I gave him none but good . But if everybody 's son was guided by their mothers , the world ' ud be different ; my son is not worse than many another woman 's son , and that in Treby , whatever they may say as have n't got their sons in prison . And as to his giving up the doctoring , and then stopping his father 's medicines , I know it 's bad that I know but it 's me has had to suffer , and it 's me a king and Parliament ' ud consider , if they meant to do the right thing , and had anybody to make it known to 'em . And as for the rioting and killing the constable my son said most plain to me he never meant it , and there was his bit of potato - pie for dinner getting dry by the fire , the whole blessed time as I sat and never knew what was coming on me . And it 's my opinion as if great people make elections to get themselves into Parliament , and there 's riot and murder to do it , they ought to see as the widow and the widow 's son does n't suffer for it . I well know my duty : and I read my Bible ; and I know in Jude where it 's been stained with the dried tulip - leaves this many a year , as you 're told not to rail at your betters if they was the devil himself ; nor will I ; but this I do say , if it 's three Mr. Transomes instead of one as is listening to me , as there 's them ought to go to the king and get him to let off my son Felix . "
187493	187497	187482	187482	she	205	" get to speak "
187628	187696	187620	187620	Harold	144	" I think you are quite right , Mrs. Holt . And for my part , I am determined to do my best for your son , both in the witness - box and elsewhere . Take comfort ; if it is necessary , the king shall be appealed to . And rely upon it , I shall bear you in mind as Felix Holt 's mother . "
187714	187719	187721	187722	Mrs. Holt	205	" Well , sir , "
187734	187848	187721	187722	Mrs. Holt	205	" I am glad to hear you speak so becoming ; and if you had been the king himself , I should have made free to tell you my opinion . For the Bible says the king 's favor is toward a wise servant ; and it 's reasonable to think he 'd make all the more account of them as have never been in service , or took wage , which I never did , and never thought of my son doing ; and his father left money , meaning otherways , so as he might have been a doctor on horseback at this very minute , instead of being in prison . "
187849	187860	187862	187869	Mr. Lingon , who had not understood this	174	" What ! was he regularly apprenticed to a doctor ? "
187872	188032	187721	187722	Mrs. Holt	205	" Sir , he was , and most clever , like his father before him , only he turned contrary . But as for harming anybody , Felix never meant to harm anybody but himself and his mother , which he certainly did in respect of his clothes , and taking to be a low workingman , and stopping my living respectable , more particular by the pills , which had a sale , as you may be sure they suited people 's insides . And what folks can never have boxes enough of to swallow , I should think you have a right to sell . And there 's many and many a text for it , as I 've opened on without ever thinking ; for if it 's true , ' Ask , and you shall have , ' I should think 365 it 's truer when you 're willing to pay for what you have . "
188108	188126	188128	188128	Esther	214	" I 'm sure you must be tired with your long walk , and little Job too , "
188138	188145	188146	188146	she	214	" Are n't you , Job ? "
188193	188208	188210	188211	Mrs. Holt	205	" It 's well you can feel for the orphin child , Miss Lyon , "
188236	188338	188210	188211	Mrs. Holt	205	" I did n't believe but what you 'd behave pretty , as you always did to me , though everybody said you held yourself high . But I 'm sure you never did to Felix , for you let him sit by you at the Free School before all the town , and him with never a bit of stock round his neck . And it shows you saw that in him worth taking notice of ; and it is but right , if you know my words are true , as you should speak for him to the gentlemen . "
188339	188347	188349	188349	Harold	144	" I assure you , Mrs. Holt , "
188355	188424	188349	188349	Harold	144	" I assure you that enough has been said to make me use my best efforts for your son . And now , pray , go on to the house with the little boy and take some rest . Dominic , show Mrs. Holt the way , and ask Mrs. Hickes to make her comfortable , and see that somebody takes her back to Treby in the buggy . "
188425	188434	188436	188436	Esther	214	" I will go back with Mrs. Holt , "
188444	188449	188451	188451	Harold	144	" No , pray , "
188464	188500	188451	188451	Harold	144	" Let Mrs. Holt have time to rest . We shall have returned , and you can see her before she goes . We will say good - by for the present , Mrs. Holt . "
188518	188523	188526	188526	she	4937	" the orphin child , "
189052	189107	189047	189047	Harold	144	" I should think there 's a good deal of worth in this young fellow this Holt , notwithstanding the mistakes he has made . A little queer and 367 conceited , perhaps ; but that is usually the case with men of his class when they are at all superior to their fellows . "
189108	189124	189126	189126	Esther	214	" Felix Holt is a highly cultivated man ; he is not at all conceited , "
189149	189152	189154	189154	Harold	144	" Ah ? "
189165	189204	189154	189154	Harold	144	" This eccentricity is a sort of fanaticism , then ? this giving up being a doctor on horseback , as the old woman calls it , and taking to let me see watchmaking , is n't it ? "
189205	189263	189294	189294	Harold	144	" If it is eccentricity to be very much better than other men , he is certainly eccentric ; and fanatical too , if it is fanatical to renounce all small selfish motives for the sake of a great and unselfish one . I never knew what nobleness of character really was before I knew Felix Holt . "
189287	189292	189294	189294	Harold	144	" God bless me ! "
189312	189324	189294	189294	Harold	144	" I wish you had talked to me about this before . "
189375	189424	189359	189359	she	214	" I think I did n't see the meaning of anything fine I did n't even see the value of my father 's character , until I had been taught a little by hearing what Felix Holt said , and seeing that his life was like his words . "
189440	189447	189448	189448	he	144	" This is not like love , "
189592	189604	189611	189611	he	144	" He 's quite an apostolic sort of fellow , then , "
189618	189685	189687	189687	Harold	144	" He did n't look like that ; but I had only a short interview with him , and I was given to understand that he refused to see me in prison . I believe he 's not very well inclined toward me . But you saw a great deal of him , I suppose , and your testimony to any one is enough for me , "
189695	189738	189687	189687	Harold	144	" Now I know what your opinion is , I shall spare no effort on behalf of such a young man . In fact , I had come to the same resolution before , but your wish would make difficult things easy . "
189888	189986	189879	189879	Harold	144	" What could we do for this young man , supposing he were let off ? I shall send a letter with fifty pounds to the old woman to - morrow . I ought to have done it before , but it really slipped my memory , amongst the many things that have occupied me lately . But this young man what do you think would be the best thing we could do for him , if he gets at large again . He should be put in a position where his qualities could be more telling . "
190046	190054	190055	190055	she	214	" You are hopelessly in the dark , "
190068	190111	190065	190065	her	214	" What would you offer Felix Holt ? a place in the Excise ? You might as well think of offering it to John the Baptist . Felix has 369 chosen his lot . He means always to be a poor man . "
190112	190117	190119	190119	Harold	144	" Means ? Yes , "
190124	190153	190119	190119	Harold	144	" but what a man means usually depends on what happens . I mean to be a commoner ; but a peerage might present itself under acceptable circumstances . "
190154	190168	190170	190170	Esther	214	" Oh , there is no sum in proportion to be done there , "
190175	190199	190170	190170	Esther	214	" As you are to a peerage so is not Felix Holt to any offer of advantage that you could imagine for him . "
190200	190215	190289	190289	Harold	144	" You must think him fit for any position the first in the county . "
190216	190223	190225	190225	Esther	214	" No , I do n't , "
190232	190241	190225	190225	Esther	214	" I think him too high for it . "
190242	190253	190289	190289	Harold	144	" I see you can be ardent in your admiration . "
190254	190272	190225	190225	Esther	214	" Yes , it is my champagne ; you know I do n't like the other kind . "
190273	190287	190289	190289	Harold	144	" That would be satisfactory if one were sure of getting your admiration , "
190346	190364	190366	190366	Harold	144	" Would it do as well to admire you , instead of being worthy to be admired ? "
190379	190391	190393	190393	Esther	214	" It would be a thing to be put up with , "
190401	190414	190393	190393	Esther	214	" But you are not in that state of self - despair . "
190415	190433	190375	190375	Esther	214	" Well , I am conscious of not having those severe virtues that you have been praising . "
190434	190446	190393	190393	Esther	214	" That is true . You are quite in another genre . "
190447	190458	190375	190375	Esther	214	" A woman would not find me a tragic hero . "
190459	190491	190393	190393	Esther	214	" Oh , no ! She must dress for general comedy such as your mother once described to me where the most thrilling event is the drawing of a handsome check . "
190492	190499	190501	190501	Harold	144	" You are a naughty fairy , "
190540	190552	190531	190531	he	144	" Confess that you are disgusted with my want of romance . "
190553	190576	190393	190393	Esther	214	" I shall not confess to being disgusted . I shall ask you to confess that you are not a romantic figure . "
190577	190585	190531	190531	he	144	" I am a little too stout . "
190587	190603	190531	190531	he	144	" For romance yes . At least you must find security for not getting stouter . "
190604	190613	190393	190393	Esther	214	" And I do n't look languishing enough ? "
190614	190627	190531	190531	he	144	" Oh , yes rather too much so at a fine cigar . "
190628	190639	190393	190393	Esther	214	" And I am not in danger of committing suicide ? "
190640	190648	190531	190531	he	144	" No ; you are a widower . "
190743	190769	190733	190733	he	144	" You do n't suppose , I hope , that any other woman has ever held the place that you could hold in my life ? "
190800	190804	190792	190792	She	214	" How so ? "
190805	190819	190792	190792	She	214	" Harry 's mother had been a slave was bought , in fact . "
190916	190967	190913	190913	Harold	144	" Though I am close on thirty - five , I never met with a woman at all like you before . There are new eras in one 's life that are equivalent to youth are something better than youth . I was never an aspirant till I knew you . "
190973	191009	190968	190968	Esther	214	" Not that I dare to call myself that . I am not so confident a personage as you imagine . I am necessarily in a painful position for a man who has any feeling . "
191066	191079	191080	191080	she	214	" Do not let us speak of difficult things any more now , "
191088	191127	191080	191080	she	214	" I am come into a new world of late , and have to learn life all over again . Let us go in . I must see poor Mrs. Holt again , and my little friend Job . "
191455	191502	191503	191504	Mrs. Holt	205	" It 's most pretty to see its little limbs , and the gentleman holding it . I should think he was amiable by his look ; but it was odd he should have his likeness took without any clothes . Was he Transome by name ? "
191548	191551	191537	191539	old Mr. Transome	144	" forty winks "
191745	191787	191807	191809	the old gentleman	1131	" in great folks , who were powerful in high quarters all the same . And Mrs. Holt rose and courtesied with a proud respect , precisely as she would have done if Mr. Transome had looked as wise as Lord Burleigh .
191788	191802	191803	191803	she	205	" I hope I 'm in no way taking a liberty , sir , "
191817	191857	191803	191803	she	205	" I 'm not that woman to sit anywhere out of my own home without inviting and pressing to . But I was brought here to wait , because the little gentleman wanted to play with the orphin child . "
191858	191870	191872	191873	Mr. Transome	144	" Very glad , my good woman sit down sit down , "
191882	191890	191872	191873	Mr. Transome	144	" Nice little boy . Your grandchild ? "
191891	191898	191900	191901	Mrs. Holt	205	" Indeed , sir , no , "
191941	192161	191928	191928	her	205	" It 's not me has any grandchild , nor ever shall have , though most fit . But with my only son saying he 'll never be married , and in prison besides , and some saying he 'll be transported , you may see yourself though a gentleman as there is n't much chance of my having grandchildren of my own . And this is old Master Tudge 's grandchild , as my own Felix took to for pity because he was sickly and clemm'd , and I was noways against it , being of a tender heart . For I 'm a widow myself , and my son Felix , though big , is fatherless , and I know my duty in consequence . And it 's to be wished , sir , as others should know it as are more in power and live in great houses , and can ride in a carriage where they will . And if you 're the gentleman as is the head of everything and it 's not to be thought you 'd give up to your son as a poor widow 's been forced to do it 373 behooves you to take the part of them as are deserving ; for the Bible says gray hairs should speak . "
192162	192173	192175	192177	old Mr. Transome	144	" Yes , yes poor woman what shall I say ? "
192193	192320	191928	191928	her	205	" Sir , I can tell you what to say fast enough ; for it 's what I should say myself if I could get to speak to the king . For I 've asked them that know , and they say it 's the truth , both out of the Bible , and in , as the king can pardon anything and anybody . And judging by his countenance on the new signs , and the talk there was a while ago about his being the people 's friend , as the minister once said it from the very pulpit if there 's any meaning in words , he 'll do the right thing by me and my son , if he 's asked proper . "
192321	192333	192335	192336	Mr. Transome	144	" Yes a very good man he 'll do anything right , "
192359	192368	192369	192369	he	144	" I 'll ask him anything you like , "
192386	192553	192369	192369	he	144	" Then , sir , if you 'll go in your carriage and say , this young man , Felix Holt by name , as his father was known the country round , and his mother most respectable he never meant harm to anybody , and so far from bloody murder and fighting , would part with his victual to them that needed it more and if you 'd get other gentlemen to say the same , and if they 're not satisfied to enquire I 'll not believe but what the king ' ud let my son out of prison . Or if it 's true he must stand his trial , the king ' ud take care no mischief happened to him . I 've got my senses , and I 'll never believe as in a country where there 's a God above and a king below , the right thing ca n't be done if great people was willing to do it . "
192648	192651	192655	192655	his	519	" Gappa , "
192800	192805	192807	192807	Esther	214	" Dear Mrs. Holt , "
192809	192866	192807	192807	Esther	214	" do rest comforted . I assure you , you have done the utmost that can be done by your words . Your visit has not been thrown away . See how the children have enjoyed it ! I saw little Job actually laughing . I think I never saw him do more than smile before . "
192876	192886	192873	192873	she	214	" Will the buggy come round to this door ? "
193134	193143	193161	193161	she	214	" the young fellow 's coming off easily , "
193480	193495	193497	193498	Mr. Lyon	208	" I had been encouraged by the assurances of men instructed in this regard , "
193513	193643	193501	193501	Esther	214	" that though he were pronounced guilty in regard to this deed whereunto he hath calamitously fallen , yet that a judge mildly disposed , and with a due sense of that invisible activity of the soul whereby the deeds which are the same in outward appearance and effect , yet differ as the knife - stroke of the surgeon , even though it kill , differs from the knife - stroke of a wanton mutilater , might use his discretion in tempering the punishment , so that it would not be very evil to bear . But now it is said that the judge who cometh is a severe man , and one nourishing a prejudice against the bolder spirits who 376 stand not in the old paths . "
193644	193657	193659	193659	Esther	214	" I am going to be present at the trial , father , "
193681	193724	193672	193672	she	214	" I mentioned to Mrs. Transome that I should like to do so , and she said that she used in old days always to attend the assizes , and that she would take me . You will be there , father ? "
193725	193841	193501	193501	Esther	214	" Assuredly I shall be there , having been summoned to bear witness to Felix 's character , and to his having uttered remonstrances and warnings long beforehand whereby he proved himself an enemy to riot . In our ears , who know him , it sounds strangely that aught else should be credible ; but he hath few to speak for him , though I trust that Mr. Harold Transome 's testimony will go far , if , as you say , he is disposed to set aside minor regards , and not to speak the truth grudgingly and reluctantly . For the very truth hath a color from the disposition of the utterer . "
193842	193854	193856	193856	Esther	214	" He is kind ; he is capable of being generous , "
193858	193969	193501	193501	Esther	214	" It is well . For I verily believe that evil - minded men have been at work against Felix . The Duffield Watchman hath written continually in allusion to him as one of those mischievous men who seek to elevate themselves through the dishonor of their party ; and as one of those who go not heart and soul with the needs of the people , but seek only to get a hearing for themselves by raising their voices in crotchety discord . It is these things that cause me heaviness of spirit : the dark secret of this young man 's lot is a cross I carry daily . "
193970	193973	193975	193975	Esther	214	" Father , "
193989	194014	193975	193975	Esther	214	" I should like to see him again before his trial . Might I ? Will you ask him ? Will you take me ? "
194066	194167	194042	194042	his	1433	" I see naught against it , my dear child , if you arrived early enough , and would take the elderly lady into your confidence , so that you might descend from the carriage at some suitable place the house of the Independent minister , for example where I could meet and accompany you . I would forewarn Felix , who would doubtless delight to see your face 377 again ; seeing that he may go away , and be , as it were , buried from you , even though it may be only in prison , and not "
194299	194374	194295	194295	he	1479	" ' Tis a great and mysterious gift , this clinging of the heart , my Esther , whereby it hath often seemed to me that even in the very moment of suffering our souls have the keenest foretaste of heaven . I speak not lightly , but as one who hath endured . And ' tis a strange truth that only in the agony of parting we look into the depths of love . "
194817	194827	194815	194815	She	214	" a fair divided excellence , whose fullness of perfection "
195388	195475	195378	195379	Mrs. Transome	269	" My dear , I shall make this house dull for you . You sit with me like an embodied patience . I am unendurable ; I am getting into a melancholy dotage . A fidgety old woman like me is as unpleasant to see as a rook with its wing broken . Do n't mind me , my dear . Run away from me without ceremony . Every one else does , you see . I am part of the old furniture with new drapery . "
195476	195481	195483	195483	Esther	214	" Dear Mrs. Transome , "
195497	195506	195483	195483	Esther	214	" do you dislike my sitting with you ? "
195507	195517	195519	195520	Mrs. Transome	523	" Only for your own sake , my fairy , "
195534	195546	195519	195520	Mrs. Transome	523	" Does n't it make you shudder to look at me ? "
195547	195556	195558	195558	Esther	214	" Why will you say such naughty things ? "
195562	195608	195558	195558	Esther	214	" If you had had a daughter , she would have desired to be with you most when you most wanted cheering . And surely every young woman has something of a daughter 's feeling toward an older one who has been kind to her . "
195610	195621	195623	195624	Mrs. Transome	523	" I should like you to be really my daughter , "
195634	195647	195623	195624	Mrs. Transome	523	" That is something still for an old woman to hope for . "
195699	195780	195696	195696	she	214	" Oh , you are so good ; I shall ask you to indulge me very much . It is to let us set out very early to Loamford on Wednesday , and put me down at a particular house , that I may keep an appointment with my father . It is a private matter , that I wish no one to know about , if possible . And he will bring me back to you wherever you appoint . "
195904	195914	195916	195917	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have arranged all things , my dear , "
195919	195931	195916	195917	Mr. Lyon	208	" and Felix expects us . We will lose no time . "
195993	196013	195989	195990	her father	1520	" It is here that we are permitted to see Felix , my Esther . He will presently appear . "
196233	196238	196240	196240	her	214	" Miss Lyon Esther ! "
196282	196291	196293	196294	Mr. Lyon	208	" Take no heed of me , children , "
196296	196321	196293	196294	Mr. Lyon	208	" I have some notes to make , and my time is precious . We may remain here only a quarter of an hour . "
196347	196363	196365	196365	Esther	214	" You are very pale ; you look ill , compared with your old self , "
196388	196400	196402	196402	Felix	134	" The fact is , I 'm not fond of prison , "
196406	196426	196402	196402	Felix	134	" but I suppose the best I can hope for is to have a good deal more of it . "
196427	196442	196444	196444	Esther	214	" It is thought that in the worst case a pardon may be obtained , "
196452	196460	196462	196462	Felix	134	" I do n't rely on that , "
196468	196505	196506	196506	he	1479	" My wisest course is to make up my mind to the very ugliest penalty they can condemn me to . If I can face that , anything less will seem easy . But you know , "
196515	196537	196506	196506	he	1479	" I never went in for fine company and cushions . I ca n't be very heavily disappointed in that way . "
196538	196550	196552	196552	Esther	214	" Do you see things just as you used to do ? "
196560	196586	196557	196557	she	214	" I mean about poverty , and the people you will live among . Has all the misunderstanding and sadness left you just as obstinate ? "
196597	196614	196616	196616	Felix	134	" What - about the sort of life I should lead if I were free again ? "
196618	196644	196645	196645	Esther	214	" Yes . I ca n't help being discouraged for you by all these things that 382 have happened . See how you may fail ! "
196665	196675	196676	196676	she	214	" Ah , I dare say I am silly , "
196681	196689	196691	196691	Felix	134	" No , you are dreadfully inspired , "
196693	196734	196691	196691	Felix	134	" When the wicked Tempter is tired of snarling that word failure in a man 's cell , he sends a voice like a thrush to say it for him . See now what a messenger of darkness you are ! "
196796	196975	196785	196785	they	5076	" But I 'm proof against that word failure . I 've seen behind it . The only failure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he sees to be best . As to just the amount of result he may see from his particular work that 's a tremendous uncertainty : the universe has not been arranged for the gratification of his feelings . As long as a man sees and believes in some great good , he 'll prefer working toward that in the way he 's best fit for , come what may . I put effects at their minimum , but I 'd rather have the maximum of effect , if it 's of the sort I care for , than the maximum of effect I do n't care for a lot of fine things that are not to my taste and if they were , the conditions of holding them while the world is what it is , are such as would jar on me like grating metal . "
196976	196979	196981	196981	Esther	214	" Yes , "
196988	197003	196981	196981	Esther	214	" I think I understand that now , better than I used to do . "
197045	197221	197042	197042	he	5079	" I do n't mean to be illustrious , you know , and make a new era , else it would be kind of you to get a raven and teach it to croak ' failure ' in my ears . Where great things ca n't happen , I care for very small things , such as will never be known beyond a few garrets and workshops . And then , as to one thing I believe in , I do n't think I can altogether fail . If there 's anything our people want convincing of , it is , that there 's some dignity and happiness for a man other than changing his station . That 's one of the beliefs I choose to consecrate my life to . If anybody could demonstrate to me that I was a flat for it , I should n't think it would follow that I must borrow money to set up genteelly and order new clothes . That 's not a rigorous consequence to my understanding . "
197242	197249	197251	197251	Esther	214	" You are just the same , "
197253	197257	197259	197259	Felix	134	" And you ? "
197261	197283	197259	197259	Felix	134	" My affairs have been settled long ago . But yours a great change has come in them magic at work . "
197284	197287	197289	197289	Esther	214	" Yes , "
197294	197297	197299	197299	Felix	134	" Well , "
197307	197351	197299	197299	Felix	134	" it 's a case of fitness that seems to give a chance sanction to that musty law . The first time I saw you your birth was an immense puzzle to me . However , the appropriate conditions are come at last . "
197388	197396	197397	197397	he	5082	" All your tastes are gratified now , "
197402	197414	197397	197397	he	5082	" But you 'll remember the old pedagogue and his lectures ? "
197495	197499	197501	197502	Mr. Lyon	208	" My children , "
197519	197527	197501	197502	Mr. Lyon	208	" we have just two minutes more . "
197597	197653	197594	197594	him	5082	" I had a horrible struggle , Esther . But you see I was right . There was a fitting lot in reserve for you . But remember you have cost a great price do n't throw what is precious away . I shall want the news that you have a happiness worthy of you . "
197694	197707	197663	197663	She	214	" Father , I am ready there is no more to say . "
197733	197736	197708	197708	She	214	" Esther ! "

198930	198943	198914	198914	Harold	269	" I hope he will not make a blunder in defending himself . "
198944	198954	198956	198956	Esther	214	" He is not likely to make a blunder , "
199062	199066	199067	199067	she	214	" Dear me , "
199077	199102	199067	199067	she	214	" how angry you look ! I never saw you look so angry before . It is not my father you are looking at ? "
199103	199119	199121	199121	Harold	269	" Oh , no ! I am angry at something I 'm looking away from , "
199139	199145	199146	199146	he	5097	" It 's that Jermyn , "
199158	199195	199146	199146	he	5097	" He will thrust himself under my eyes everywhere since I refused him an interview and returned his letter . I 'm determined never to speak to him directly again , if I can help it . "
199228	199232	199222	199222	She	269	" Of course ! "
199383	199387	199376	199376	he	314	" better sport . "

199933	200074	199908	199908	he	5097	" My Lord , I am not going to occupy the time of the Court with unnecessary words . I believe the witnesses for the prosecution have spoken the truth as far as a superficial observation would enable them to do it ; and I see nothing that can weigh with the jury in my favor , unless they believe my statement of my own motives , and the testimony that certain witnesses will give to my character and purposes as being inconsistent with my willingly abetting disorder . I will tell the Court in as few words as I can , how I got entangled in the mob , how I came to attack the constable , and how I was led to take a course which seems rather mad to myself , now I look back upon it . "
200207	200562	200563	200563	Felix	134	" That is all I have to say for myself , my Lord . I pleaded ' Not guilty ' to the charge of manslaughter , because I know that word may carry a meaning which would not fairly apply to my act . When I threw Tucker down , I did not see the possibility that he would die from a sort of attack which ordinarily occurs in fighting without any fatal effect . As to my assaulting a constable , it was a quick choice between two evils : I should else have been disabled . And he attacked me under a mistake about my intentions . I 'm not prepared to say I never would assault a constable where I had more chance of deliberation . I certainly should assault him if I saw him doing anything that made my blood boil : I reverence the law , but not where it is a pretext for wrong , which it should be the very object of law to hinder . I consider that I should be making an unworthy defence , if I let the Court infer from what I say myself , or from what is said by my witnesses , that because I am a man who hates drunken , motiveless disorder , or any wanton harm , therefore I am a man who would never fight against authority : I hold it blasphemy to say that a man ought not to fight against authority : there is no great religion and no great freedom that has not done it , in the beginning . It would be impertinent for me to speak of this now , if I did not need to say in my own defence , that I should hold myself the worst sort of traitor if I put my hand to either fighting or disorder which must mean to injure somebody if I were not urged to it by what I hold to be sacred feelings , making a sacred duty either to my own manhood or to my fellow - man . And certainly , "
200576	200638	200573	200573	his	5187	" I never held it a sacred duty to try and get a Radical candidate returned for North Loamshire , by willingly heading a drunken howling mob , whose public action must consist in breaking windows , destroying hard - got produce , and endangering the lives of men and women . I have no more to say , my Lord . "
200639	200648	200650	200650	Harold	269	" I foresaw he would make a blunder , "
200683	200696	200697	200697	he	5188	" I do n't mean what he said about the Radical candidate , "
200705	200834	200697	200697	he	5188	" I do n't mean the last sentence . I mean that whole peroration of his , which he ought to have left unsaid . It has done him harm with the jury they wo n't understand it , or rather will misunderstand it . 390 And I 'll answer for it , it has soured the judge . It remains to be seen what we witnesses can say for him , to nullify the effect of what he has said for himself . I hope the attorney has done his best in collecting the evidence : I understand the expense of the witnesses is undertaken by some Liberals at Glasgow and in Lancashire , friends of Holt 's . But I suppose your father has told you . "
201299	201346	201280	201280	he	208	" Nay would to God he were ! I should then feel that the great virtues and the pure life I have beheld in him were a witness to the efficacy of the faith I believe in and the discipline of the Church whereunto I belong . "
202219	202241	202212	202212	his	144	" Mr. Jermyn was my agent then , not now : I have no longer any but hostile relations with him . "
202288	202310	202311	202311	Harold	144	" You acquiesced in the treating of the Sproxton men , as necessary to the efficient working of the reformed constituency ? "
202317	202356	202311	202311	Harold	144	" Yes ; on my return to England , before I put up for North Loamshire , I got the best advice from practised agents , both Whig and Tory . They all agreed as to electioneering measures . "

On the day of the election at Treby , when I had been much alarmed by the noises that reached me from the main street , Felix Holt came to call upon me . He knew that my father was away , and he thought that I should be alarmed by the sounds of disturbance . It was about the middle of the day , and he came to tell me that the disturbance was quieted , and that the streets were nearly emptied . But he said he feared that the men would collect again after drinking , and that something worse might happen later in the day . And he was in much sadness at this thought . He stayed a little while , and then he left me . He was very melancholy . His mind was full of great resolutions that came from his kind feeling toward others . It was the last thing he would have done to join in riot or to hurt any man , if he could have helped it . His nature is very noble ; he is tender - hearted ; he could never have had any intention that was not brave and good . "

Nonsense . Will there be a man knocked down the less for it ? That girl made me cry . Depend upon it , whether she 's going to marry Transome or not , she 's been fond of Holt in her poverty , you know . She 's a modest , brave , beautiful woman . I 'd ride a steeple - chase , old as I am , to gratify her feelings . Hang it ! the fellow 's a good fellow if she thinks so . And he threw out a fine sneer , I thought , at the Radical candidate . Depend upon it , he 's a good fellow at bottom . "
205106	205115	205081	205081	he	1106	" knew Phil would be on that side . "
205216	205225	205192	205202	The gentlemen who gathered in the room at the White Hart	5327	" of 399 all shades of political opinion , "
206307	206336	206338	206338	we	5366	" That 's all very fine , but I 'm not going to be ruined if I can help it least of all , ruined in that way . "
206727	206739	206698	206698	Jermyn	173	" Mr. Transome , I must speak to you in private . "
206867	206878	206850	206850	He	173	" You will repent else for your mother 's sake . "
206975	206983	206985	206985	Harold	144	" Let me go , you scoundrel ! "
206989	206999	206985	206985	Harold	144	" or I 'll be the death of you . "
207000	207003	207005	207005	Jermyn	173	" Do , "
207012	207018	207005	207005	Jermyn	173	" I am your father . "
207160	207167	207168	207169	the baronet	1833	" Leave the room , sir ! "
207181	207189	207168	207169	the baronet	1833	" This is a meeting of gentlemen . "
207190	207195	207196	207196	he	1833	" Come , Harold , "
207205	207211	207196	207196	he	1833	" come away with me . "
207527	207539	207510	207510	Harold	144	" Take the child away . Ask where my mother is . "
207652	207656	207647	207647	Her	782	" Come in . "
207879	207882	207883	207883	he	144	" Mother , "
207900	207914	207883	207883	he	144	" tell me the truth , that I may know how to act . "
207924	207930	207915	207915	He	144	" Who is my father ? "
207957	207971	207953	207953	he	144	" He has said said it before others that he is my father . "
208371	208386	208365	208369	an Adam who had complained	5425	" The woman she gave me of the tree , and I did eat . "
208557	208578	208579	208579	she	214	" I think I am getting that power Felix wished me to have : I shall soon see strong visions , "
209079	209087	209089	209089	Harold	144	" Do n't let me alarm you , "
209100	209133	209089	209089	Harold	144	" I suppose I carry the marks of a past agitation . It relates entirely to troubles of my own of my own family . No one beyond is involved in them . "
209145	209148	209150	209150	Harold	144	" But , "
209168	209225	209150	209150	Harold	144	" it involves a difference in my position 407 with regard to you ; and it is on this point that I wished to speak to you at once . When a man sees what ought to be done , he had better do it forthwith . He ca n't answer for himself to - morrow . "
209261	209341	209241	209241	Harold	144	" My feelings drag me another way . I need not tell you that your regard has become very important to me that if our mutual position had been different that , in short , you must have seen if it had not seemed to be a matter of worldly interest , I should have told you plainly already that I loved you , and that my happiness could be complete only if you would consent to marry me . "
209403	209557	209395	209395	Harold	144	" But to - day I have heard something that affects my own position . I can not tell you what it is . There is no need . It is not any culpability of my own . But I have not just the same unsullied name and fame in the eyes of the world around us , as I believed that I had when I allowed myself to entertain that wish about you . You are very young , entering on a fresh life with bright prospects you are worthy of everything that is best . I may be too vain in thinking it was at all necessary ; but I take this precaution against myself . I shut myself out from the chance of trying , after to - day , to induce you to accept anything which others may regard as specked and stained by any obloquy , however slight . "
209629	209671	209625	209625	himself	144	" What is to be done now is , that we should proceed at once to the necessary legal measures for putting you in possession of your own , and arranging mutual claims . After that I shall probably leave England . "
209728	209740	209724	209724	she	214	" Should you be urged obliged to go in any case ? "
209741	209749	209750	209750	Harold	144	" Not in every case , perhaps , "
209764	209775	209750	209750	Harold	144	" at least not for long , not for always . "
209798	209829	209791	209791	she	214	" I ca n't speak . I ca n't say anything to - night . A great decision has to be made : I must wait till to - morrow . "
210036	210081	210031	210031	him	144	" You will be glad to hear that we shall get a very powerfully signed memorial to the Home Secretary about young Holt . I think your speaking for him helped a great deal . You made all the men wish what you wished . "
210278	210283	210273	210273	her	214	" Good - night . "
211580	211591	211576	211576	she	162	" Pray , speak , madam . What has happened ? "
211592	211600	211576	211576	she	162	" The worst , Denner the worst . "
211601	211617	211576	211576	she	162	" You are ill . Let me undress you , and put you to bed . "
211618	211640	211576	211576	she	162	" No , I am not ill . I am not going to die ! I shall live I shall live ! "
211641	211647	211576	211576	she	162	" What may I do ? "
211648	211667	211576	211576	she	162	" Go and say I shall not dine . Then you may come back , if you will . "
211733	211753	211729	211730	Mrs. Transome	269	" Go down , Denner , and find out where Harold is , and come back and tell me . "
211754	211766	211705	211705	her	269	" Shall I ask him to come to you , madam ? "
211767	211785	211729	211730	Mrs. Transome	269	" No ; do n't dare to do it , if you love me . Come back . "
211824	211832	211705	211705	her	269	" Light the candles and leave me . "
211833	211840	211729	211730	Mrs. Transome	269	" May n't I come again ? "
211841	211855	211705	211705	her	269	" No . It may be that my son will come to me . "
211856	211869	211729	211730	Mrs. Transome	269	" May n't I sleep on the little bed in your bedroom ? "
211870	211887	211705	211705	her	269	" No , good Denner ; I am not ill . You ca n't help me . "
211888	211899	211729	211730	Mrs. Transome	269	" That 's the hardest word of all , madam . "
211900	211915	211705	211705	her	269	" The time will come but not now . Kiss me . Now go . "
212584	212595	212569	212570	Mrs. Transome	269	" Oh , why did n't you call me before ? "
212708	212716	212706	212706	she	5479	" God has some pity on me . "
212718	212724	212726	212726	Esther	214	" Rest on my bed , "
212728	212747	212706	212706	she	5479	" You are so tired . I will cover you up warmly , and then you will sleep . "
212748	212760	212706	212706	she	5479	" No tell me , dear tell me what Harold said . "
212761	212770	212706	212706	she	5479	" That he has had some new trouble . "
212771	212779	212706	212706	she	5479	" He said nothing hard about me ? "
212780	212790	212706	212706	she	5479	" No nothing . He did not mention you . "
212791	212801	212706	212706	she	5479	" I have been an unhappy woman , dear . "
212802	212807	212809	212809	Esther	214	" I feared it , "
212815	212839	212706	212706	she	5479	" Men are selfish . They are selfish and cruel . What they care for is their own pleasure and their own pride . "
212840	212844	212846	212846	Esther	214	" Not all , "
212858	212865	212867	212868	Mrs. Transome	269	" All I have ever loved , "
212881	212908	212870	212870	She	269	" For more than twenty years I have not had an hour 's happiness . Harold knows it , and yet he is hard to me . "
212909	212931	212933	212933	Esther	214	" He will not be . To - morrow he will not be . I am sure he will be good , "
212937	212953	212933	212933	Esther	214	" Remember he said to me his trouble was new he has not had time . "
212954	212964	212965	212966	Mrs. Transome	269	" It is too hard to bear , dear , "
212982	213008	212974	212974	she	269	" I am old , and expect so little now a very little thing would seem great . Why should I be punished any more ? "
213094	213119	213120	213120	she	214	" Do let me go to your own room with you , and let me undress you , and let me tend upon you , "
213130	213154	213120	213120	she	214	" It will be a very great thing to me . I shall seem to have a mother again . Do let me . "
213280	213299	213268	213268	Esther	214	" It is late , Mrs. Hickes . Do you think Mr. Harold is out of his room ? "
213300	213314	213268	213268	Esther	214	" Yes , a long while ; he was out earlier than usual . "
213315	213330	213268	213268	Esther	214	" Will you ask him to come up here ? Say I begged you . "
213381	213399	213374	213374	he	144	" Good God ! how ill you look ! Have you been sitting up with my mother ? "
213400	213408	213410	213410	Esther	214	" Yes . She is asleep now , "
213432	213439	213441	213441	Harold	144	" Has she told you anything ? "
213443	213472	213441	213441	Harold	144	" No , only that she is wretched . Oh , I think I would bear a great deal of unhappiness to save her from having any more . "
213515	213555	213497	213497	Esther	214	" There is nothing in all this place nothing since ever I came here I could care for so much as that you should sit down by her now , and that she should see you when she wakes . "
213572	213598	213561	213561	she	214	" I know you would have come . I know you meant it . But she is asleep now . Go gently before she wakes . "
213654	213676	213652	213652	she	214	" If that dear thing will marry you , Harold , it will make up to you for a great deal . "
213921	213927	213929	213929	Felix	134	" Mr. Lyon at home ? "
213936	213941	213943	213943	Esther	214	" No , sir , "
213949	213963	213943	213943	Esther	214	" but Miss Lyon is , if you 'll please to walk in . "
213964	213967	213969	213969	Felix	134	" Esther ! "
213991	213998	213943	213943	Esther	214	" You are out of prison ? "
213999	214017	213943	213943	Esther	214	" Yes , till I do something bad again . But you ? how is it all ? "
214018	214024	214026	214026	Esther	214	" Oh , it is , "
214043	214087	214031	214031	she	214	" that everything is as usual : my father is gone to see the sick ; Lyddy is gone in deep despondency to buy the grocery ; and I am sitting here , with some vanity in me , needing to be scolded . "
214124	214134	214120	214120	she	214	" Are you come back to live here then ? "
214135	214138	214120	214120	she	214	" Yes . "
214139	214156	214120	214120	she	214	" You are not going to be married to Harold Transome , or to be rich ? "
214157	214160	214120	214120	she	214	" No . "
214183	214186	214188	214188	Felix	134	" Why ? "
214216	214230	214211	214211	he	5517	" I did not wish to marry him , or to be rich . "
214231	214239	214241	214241	Felix	134	" You have given it all up ? "
214332	214347	214324	214324	Felix	134	" Could you share the life of a poor man , then , Esther ? "
214348	214357	214358	214358	she	214	" If I thought well enough of him , "
214375	214396	214372	214372	her	214	" Have you considered well what it would be ? that it would be a very bare and simple life ? "
214397	214404	214372	214372	her	214	" Yes without atta of rose . "
214436	214510	214427	214427	he	5517	" And the people I shall live among , Esther ? They have not just the same follies and vices as the rich , but they have their own forms of folly and vice ; and they have not what are called the refinements of the rich to make their faults more bearable . I do n't say more bearable to me I 'm not fond of those refinements ; but you are . "
214519	214527	214511	214511	Felix	134	" It is very serious , Esther . "
214528	214535	214537	214537	Esther	214	" I know it is serious , "
214544	214581	214537	214537	Esther	214	" Since I have been at Transome Court I have seen many things very seriously . If I had not , I should not have left what I did leave . I made a deliberate choice . "
214601	214606	214607	214607	he	5517	" And these curls ? "
214627	214635	214622	214622	his	5517	" They cost nothing they are natural . "
214636	214644	214582	214582	Felix	134	" You are such a delicate creature . "
214645	214665	214666	214666	Esther	214	" I am very healthy . Poor women , I think , are healthier than the rich . Besides , "
214675	214683	214666	214666	Esther	214	" I think of having some wealth . "
214684	214687	214689	214689	Felix	134	" How ? "
214696	214702	214689	214689	Felix	134	" What do you mean ? "
214703	214812	214666	214666	Esther	214	" I think even of two pounds a week : one need n't live up to the splendor of all that , you know ; we might live as simply as you liked : there would be money to spare , and you could do wonders , and be obliged to work too , only not if sickness came . And then I think of a little income for 418 your mother , enough for her to live as she has been used to live ; and a little income for my father , to save him from being dependent when he is no longer able to preach . "
214833	214854	214823	214823	she	214	" I mean if you approve . I wish to do what you think it will be right to do . "
214888	214918	214875	214875	he	5521	" Why , I shall be able to set up a great library , and lend the books to be dog's - eared and marked with bread - crumbs . "
214924	214953	214919	214919	Esther	214	" You think you are to be everything . You do n't know how clever I am . I mean to go on teaching a great many things . "
214954	214958	214919	214919	Esther	214	" Teaching me ? "
214959	214964	214965	214965	she	214	" Oh , yes , "
214973	214981	214965	214965	she	214	" I shall improve your French accent . "
214982	214993	214995	214995	Felix	134	" You wo n't want me to wear a stock , "
215005	215023	214965	214965	she	214	" No ; and you will not attribute stupid thoughts to me before I 've uttered them . "
215075	215114	215065	215065	his	5526	" I 'm a rough , severe fellow , Esther . Shall you never repent ? never be inwardly reproaching me that I was not a man who could have shared your wealth ? Are you quite sure ? "
215115	215119	215121	215121	Esther	214	" Quite sure ! "
215127	215151	215121	215121	Esther	214	" for then I should have honored you less . I am weak my husband must be greater and nobler than I am . "
215152	215162	215164	215164	Felix	134	" Oh , I tell you what , though ! "
215182	215207	215164	215164	Felix	134	" if you take me in that way I shall be forced to be a much better fellow than I ever thought of being . "
215208	215214	215216	215216	Esther	214	" I call that retribution , "
215294	215318	215283	215284	Mr. Lyon	208	" wherein there was no bondage to questionable forms , so that he might have a more enlarged utterance of joy and supplication . "
215405	215409	215389	215390	Some few	5539	" more behind . "
215446	215475	215427	215428	Mr. Wace	203	" It 's wonderful how things go through you you do n't know how . I feel somehow as if I believed more in everything that 's good . "
215493	215566	215483	215483	she	522	" implying that justice certainly had much more in reserve . Little Job Tudge had an entirely new suit , of which he fingered every separate brass button in a way that threatened an arithmetical mania ; and Mrs. Holt had out her best tea - trays and put down her carpet again , with the satisfaction of thinking that there would no more be boys coming in all weathers with dirty shoes .
215649	215652	215647	215647	some	5582	" abroad , "
