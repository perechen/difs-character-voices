1464	1473	1475	1476	Mary Antony	85	" Thou good - for - nothing imp ! "
1485	1664	1478	1478	her	85	" Thou little vain man , in thy red jerkin ! Beshrew thine impudence , intruding into a place where women alone do dwell , and no male thing may enter . I would have thee take warning by the fate of the baker 's boy , who dared to climb into a tree , so that he might peep over the wall and spy upon the holy Ladies in their garden . Boasting afterward of that which he had done , and making merry over that which he pretended to have seen , our great Lord Bishop heard of it , and sent and took that baker 's boy , and though he cried for mercy , swearing the whole tale was an empty boast , they put out his bold eyes with heated tongs , and hanged him from the very branches he had climbed . They 'd do the like to thee , thou little vain man , if Mary Antony reported on thy ways . Wouldst like to hang , in thy red doublet ? "
1953	1968	1970	1971	Mary Antony	85	" Ha , thou little vain man , in thy brown and red suit ! "
1996	2210	1983	1983	she	85	" Is that thy little ' grace before meat ' ? But , I pray thee , Sir Robin , who said there was cheese in my wallet ? Nay , is there like to be cheese in a wallet already containing five - and - twenty holy Ladies on their way back from Vespers ? Out upon thee for a most irreverent little glutton ! I fear me thou hast not only a high look , thou hast also a proud stomach ; just the reverse of the great French Cardinal who came , with much pomp , to visit us at Easter time . He had a proud look and a Come down again , thou little naughty man , and I will tell thee what the Lord Cardinal had under his crimson sash . ' Tis not a thing to shout to the tree - tops . I might have to recite ten Paternosters , if I let thee tempt me so to do . For whispering it in thine ear , I should but say one ; for having remarked it , none at all . Facts are facts ; and , even in the case of so weighty a fact , the responsibility rests not upon the beholder . "
2344	2357	2358	2358	she	85	" I can not let thy little grace return unto thee void , "
2534	2542	2543	2545	chuckled old Antony	85	" Feed thyself , thou little worldling ! "
2558	2738	2543	2545	chuckled old Antony	85	" Who art thou to come here presuming to teach thy betters lessons of self - sacrifice ? First feed thyself ; then give to the hungry , the fragments that remain . Had I five squealing children here which Heaven forbid I should eat mine own mess , and count myself charitable if I let them lick the dish . The holy Ladies give to the poor at the Convent gate , that for which they have no further use . Does thy jaunty fatherhood presume to shame our saintly celibacy ? Mother Sub - Prioress did chide me sharply because , to a poor soul with many hungry mouths to feed , I gave a good piece of venison , and not the piece which was tainted . Truth to tell , I had already made away with the tainted piece ; but Mother Sub - Prioress was pleased to think it was in the pot , seething for the holy Ladies ' evening meal ; and wherefore should Mother Sub - Prioress not think as she pleased ?
2739	2825	2831	2831	I	0	" ' Woman ! ' she cried ; ' Woman ! ' and when Mother Sub - Prioress says ' Woman ! ' the woman she addresses feels her estate would be higher had God Almighty been pleased to have let her be the Man , or even the Serpent , so much contempt does Mother Sub - Prioress infuse into the name ' Woman ! ' said Mother Sub - Prioress , ' wouldst thou make all the Ladies of the Convent ill ? ' "
2880	2893	2895	2896	The Poor	4220	" ' Tush , fool ! ' snarled Mother Sub - Prioress . "
2904	3014	2895	2896	The Poor	4220	" Tush indeed ! I tell thee , little bright - eyed man , old Antony , can ' tush ' to better purpose ! That night there were strong purging herbs in the broth of Mother Sub - Prioress . Yet she did but keep her bed for one day . Like the Poor , she is not easily made ill ! . . . Well , have thy way ; only peck not my fingers , Master Robin , or I will have thee flogged through the Tything at the cart - tail , as was done to a certain pieman , whose history I will now relate .
3015	3040	2895	2896	The Poor	4220	" Once upon a time , when Sister Mary Antony was young , and fair to look upon Nay , wink not thy naughty eye "
3257	3263	3265	3266	Mary Antony	85	" Adhaesit pavimento anima mea , "
3268	3279	3265	3266	Mary Antony	85	" Wherefore are the holy Ladies late to - day ? "
3280	3289	3291	3295	the young lay - sister	379	" One fell to weeping in the darkness , "
3297	3356	3291	3295	the young lay - sister	379	" whereupon Mother Sub - Prioress caused all to stand still while she strove , by the light of my lantern held high , to discover who had burst forth with a sob . None shewing traces of tears , she gave me back the lantern , herself walking last in the line , as all moved on . "
3357	3369	3371	3372	Mary Antony	85	" Convertentur ad vesperam , and the devil catch the hindmost , "
3377	3380	3382	3383	Sister Abigail	99	" Amen , "
4155	4158	4148	4148	her	85	" Amen . "
4176	4181	4182	4182	she	419	" Peace , woman ! "
4185	4220	4182	4182	she	419	" The Convent cloister is not a hen - yard . Such ill - timed devotion well - nigh merits penance . Rise from thy knees , and go at once about thy business . "
4283	4292	4293	4293	she	103	" Beans in her broth to - night , "
4296	4334	4293	4293	she	103	" One for ' woman ' ; another for the hen - yard ; a third for threatening penance when I did but chant a melodious ' Amen . ' I 'll give her beans castor beans ! "
4477	4484	4485	4485	she	430	" How now , dear Antony ? "
4490	4519	4485	4485	she	430	" Get up ! Hang the key in its appointed place , and make me thy report . Have all returned ? As always , is all well ? "
4548	4552	4553	4553	she	264	" Reverend Mother , "
4556	4599	4553	4553	she	264	" all who went forth have returned . But all is not well . Sister Mary Seraphine is uttering wild cries in her cell ; and much I fear me , Mother Sub - Prioress may pass by , and hear her . "
4632	4640	4641	4641	she	430	" Go thy ways , dear Antony , "
4644	4666	4616	4616	She	373	" I myself will visit the little Sister in her cell . None will attempt to enter while I am there . "
4669	4674	4675	4675	SHE	373	" GIVE ME TENDERNESS , "
4732	4737	4739	4740	the Prioress	373	" Mother of God , "
4746	4804	4739	4740	the Prioress	373	" give me patience in dealing with wilfulness ; grant me wisdom to cope with unreason ; may it be given me to share the pain of this heart in torment , even as when thou didst witness the sufferings of thy dear Son , our Lord , on Calvary a sword pierced through thine own soul also .
4805	4826	4872	4872	she	373	" Give me this gift of sympathy with suffering , though the cross be not mine own , but another 's .
4827	4858	4739	4740	the Prioress	373	" But give me firmness and authority : even as when thou didst say to the servants at Cana : ' Whatsoever He saith unto you , do it . ' "
4887	4892	4893	4893	she	373	" Give me tenderness , "
4972	4998	4966	4966	she	102	" Trappings of crimson , and silver bells : mane and tail , like foam of the waves ; a palfrey as white as snow ! "
5060	5068	5110	5112	Sister Mary Seraphine	102	" Trappings of crimson , and silver bells "
5092	5108	5110	5112	Sister Mary Seraphine	102	" Oh ! . . . Oh ! . . . Oh ! . . . "
5119	5137	5110	5112	Sister Mary Seraphine	102	" mane and tail , like foam of the waves ; a palfrey as white as snow ! "
5179	5188	5189	5189	she	102	" Trappings of crimson , and silver bells ! "
5223	5228	5229	5229	she	102	" Mane and tail , "
5237	5242	5207	5212	the Prioress standing at the casement	444	" foam of the waves "
5290	5293	5294	5294	she	102	" Wilfred ! "
5297	5307	5294	5294	she	102	" Wilfred ! Are you coming to save me ? "
5328	5331	5318	5319	The Prioress	91	" Wilfred , "
5435	5439	5440	5440	she	102	" Sister Seraphine , "
5443	5479	5440	5440	she	102	" for you must shew true penitence e'er I can permit you to be called by our Lady 's name you will now come to my cell , where I will presently speak with you . "
5486	5492	5493	5493	she	102	" I can not walk , "
5496	5502	5504	5505	the Prioress	373	" You will not walk , "
5509	5519	5504	5505	the Prioress	373	" You will travel upon your hands and knees . "
5532	5535	5536	5536	she	102	" Moreover , "
5543	5568	5536	5536	she	102	" if you do not appear in my presence in reasonable time , I shall be constrained to send for Mother Sub - Prioress . "
5794	5797	5790	5790	she	102	" Wilfred , "
5926	5934	5935	5935	she	102	" You may rise to your feet , "
5938	5945	5935	5935	she	102	" and shut to the door . "
5958	5968	5970	5971	the Prioress	373	" You may arrange the disorder of your dress , "
6031	6038	6039	6039	she	373	" Be seated , my child , "
6048	6073	6039	6039	she	373	" There is much which must now be said , and your mind will pay better heed , if your body be at rest . "
6106	6118	6120	6121	the Prioress	373	" What was the cause of this outburst , my child ? "
6126	6307	6078	6079	the Prioress	373	" While in the Cathedral , Reverend Mother , up in our gallery , I , being placed not far from a window , heard , in a moment of silence , the neighing of a horse in the street without . It was like to the neighing of mine own lovely palfrey , waiting in the castle court at home , until I should come down and mount him . Each time that steed neighed , I could see Snowflake more clearly , in trappings of gay crimson , with silver bells , amid many others prancing impatiently , champing their bits as they waited ; for it pleased me to come out last , when all were mounted . Then the riders lifted their plumed caps when I appeared , while Wilfred , pushing my page aside , did swing me into the saddle . Thus , with shouting and laughter and winding of horn , we would all ride out to the hunt or the tourney ; I first , on Snowflake ; Wilfred , close behind . "
6334	6339	6340	6340	she	373	" Who was Wilfred ? "
6350	6361	6310	6311	the Prioress	373	" My cousin , whom I should have we d if "
6362	6365	6310	6311	the Prioress	373	" If ? "
6366	6375	6310	6311	the Prioress	373	" If I had not left the world . "
6381	6417	6376	6377	The Prioress	373	" If your heart was set upon wedding your cousin , my child , why did you profess a vocation and , renouncing all worldly and carnal desires , gain admission to our sacred Order ? "
6418	6429	6431	6432	Sister Seraphine	102	" My heart was not set on marrying my cousin ! "
6437	6503	6431	6432	Sister Seraphine	102	" I was weary of Wilfred . I was weary of everything ! I wanted to profess . I wished to become a nun . There were people I could punish , and people I could surprise , better so , than in any other way . But Wilfred said that , when the time came , he would be there to carry me off . "
6504	6511	6525	6526	The Prioress	373	" And when the time came ? "
6512	6524	6431	6432	Sister Seraphine	102	" He was not there . I never saw him again . "
6572	6576	6577	6577	she	373	" Sister Seraphine , "
6580	6630	6577	6577	she	373	" many who embrace the religious life , know what it is to pass through the experience you have now had ; but , as a rule , they fight the temptation and conquer it in the secret of their own hearts , in the silence of their own cells .
6631	6692	6770	6770	she	373	" Memories of the life that was , before , choosing the better part , we left the world , come back to haunt us , with a wanton sweetness . Such memories can not change the state , fixed forever by our vows ; but they may awaken in us vain regrets or worldly longings . Therein lies their sinfulness .
6693	6729	6577	6577	she	373	" To help you against this danger , I will now give you two prayers , which you must commit to memory , and repeat whenever need arises . The first is from the Breviary . "
6819	6825	6826	6826	she	373	" This prayer might suffice , "
6829	6868	6826	6826	she	373	" if our hearts were truly honest , if our wills were ever yielded . But , alas , our hearts are deceitful above all things , and our wills are apt to turn traitor to our good intentions .
6869	6933	6806	6806	Her	373	" Therefore I have found for you , in the Gregorian Sacramentary , another prayer less well - known , yet much more ancient , written over six hundred years ago . It deals effectually with the deceitful heart , the insidious , tempting thoughts , and the unstable will . Here is a translation which I have myself inscribed upon the margin . "
7131	7199	7125	7125	she	373	" These prayers , my child , which you will commit to memory before you sleep this night , will protect you from a too insistent recollection of the world you have resigned ; and will assist you , with real inward thoroughness , to die daily to self , in order that the Holy Name of our dear Lord may be more worthily magnified in you . "
7294	7303	7304	7304	she	102	" But I do not want to die ! "
7307	7317	7304	7304	she	102	" I want to live to live to live ! "
7345	7348	7350	7351	the Prioress	373	" Kneel ! "
7392	7400	7401	7401	she	91	" We die that we may live , "
7406	7449	7401	7401	she	91	" Sister Seraphine , this is the lesson your wayward heart must learn . Dying to self , we live unto God . Dying to sin , we live unto righteousness . Dying to the world , we find the Life Eternal . "
7471	7481	7482	7482	she	102	" But I want to live to the world ! "
7677	7681	7682	7682	she	373	" My child , "
7685	7770	7682	7682	she	373	" there are things we are called upon to suffer which we can best tell to our blessed Lady , herself . Try to unburden your heart and find comfort . . . Does your mind hark back to the thought of the earthly love you resigned in order to give yourself solely to the heavenly ? . . . Are you troubled by fears lest you wronged the man you loved , when , leaving him , you became the bride of Heaven ? "
7779	7782	7783	7783	she	102	" Nay , "
7786	7798	7783	7783	she	102	" I was weary of Wilfred . But there were others . "
7812	7826	7802	7803	the Prioress	91	" Is it then the Fact of marriage which you desired and regret ? "
7840	7876	7827	7828	Sister Seraphine	102	" Nay , I could not have brooked to be bound to any man . But I liked to be loved , and I liked to be First in the thought and heart of another . "
7962	8008	7955	7955	she	373	" Is it the ceaseless longing to have had a little child of your own to hold in your arms , to gather to your breast , to put to sleep upon your knees , which keeps your heart turning restlessly back to the world ? "
8020	8027	8028	8028	she	102	" Nay , then , indeed ! "
8033	8055	8028	8028	she	102	" Always have I hated children . To escape from the vexations of motherhood were reason enough for leaving the world . "
8071	8080	8081	8081	she	373	" You are playing false to your vows , "
8084	8141	8081	8081	she	373	" you are slighting your vocation ; yet no worthy or noble feeling draws your heart back to the world . You do but desire vain pomp and show ; all those things which minister to the enthronement of self . Return to your cell and spend three hours in prayer and penitence before the crucifix . "
8188	8191	8192	8192	she	373	" Surely , "
8223	8223	8192	8192	she	373	"
8275	8282	8283	8283	she	373	" Death ! Death ! Death ! "
8286	8327	8283	8283	she	373	" helpless , hopeless , terrible ! I ask for life , I want to live ; I am young , I am gay , I am beautiful . And they bid bid bid me kneel long hours watching death . "
8336	8361	8328	8328	Her	373	" Ah , HA ! That will I NOT ! A dead God can not help me ! I want life , not death ! "
8572	8575	8576	8576	she	373	" Enter , "
8584	8588	8590	8591	the Prioress	373	" Sister Seraphine , "
8597	8612	8590	8591	the Prioress	373	" has profaned the crucifix , reviling our blessed Lord , Who hangs thereon . "
8710	8717	8718	8718	she	373	" Carry her to her cell , "
8756	8803	8750	8751	the Prioress	373	" All will now go to their cells and kneel in adoration before the crucifix . Doors are to be left standing wide . The Miserere is to be chanted , until the ringing of the Refectory bell . Mother Sub - Prioress will remain behind . "
8891	8900	8901	8901	she	91	" Is mine the task , Reverend Mother ? "
8928	8931	8932	8932	she	91	" Yes , "
9016	9019	9021	9022	the Prioress	91	" No , "
9051	9054	9056	9057	the Prioress	91	" No , "
9212	9219	9209	9210	Sister Seraphine	102	" I want life not death ! "
9619	9630	9632	9633	Mary Antony	103	" Nay , I have naught for thee this morning , "
9638	9682	9632	9633	Mary Antony	103	" naught , that is , save spritely conversation . I can tell thee a tale or two ; I can give thee sage advice ; but , in my wallet , little Master Mendicant , I have but my bag of peas . "
9958	9964	9965	9965	she	264	" Now , Master Pieman ! "
9968	10037	9965	9965	she	264	" At thine own risk thou doest it ; but with thine own bright eyes thou shalt see the holy Ladies ; the Unnamed , all like peas in a pod , as the Lord knows they do look , when they walk to and fro ; but first , if so be that I can find them , the Few which I distinguish from among the rest . "
10070	10073	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" This , "
10088	10185	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" is the Reverend Mother , Herself large , and pure , and noble . . . . Nay , hop not too close , Sir Redbreast ! When we enter her chamber we kneel at the threshold , till she bids us draw nearer . True , we are merely soberly - clad , holy women , whereas thou art a gay , gaudy man ; bold - eyed , and , doubtless , steeped in sin . But even thou must keep thy distance , in presence of this most Reverend Pea of great price .
10186	10189	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" This , "
10195	10216	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" is Mother Sub - Prioress , who would love to have the whipping of thee , thou naughty little rascal !
10217	10240	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" This is Sister Mary Rebecca who daily grows more crooked , both in mind and body ; yet who ever sweetly smileth .
10241	10369	10075	10076	Mary Antony	103	" Now will I show thee , if so be that I can find her , Sister Teresa , a kindly soul and gracious , but with a sniff which may be heard in the kitchens when that holy Lady taketh her turn at the Refectory reading . And when , the reading over , having sniffed every other minute , she at length , feels free to blow , beshrew me , Master Redbreast , one might think our old dun cow had just been parted from a newly - born calf . Yea , a kind , gracious soul ; but noisy about the nose , and forgetful of the ears of other people , her own necessity seeming excuse enough for veritable trumpet blasts . "
10558	10568	10570	10571	Mary Antony	103	" Ah , thou Knight of the Bloody Vest ! "
10573	10745	10570	10571	Mary Antony	103	" Heaven send thy wicked perfidy may fall on thine own pate ! Intruding thyself into our most private places ; begging food , which could not be refused ; wheedling old Mary Antony into letting thee have a peep at the holy Ladies thou bold , bad man ! and then carrying off the Reverend Mother , Herself ! Ha ! Hadst thou but caught away Mother Sub - Prioress , she would have reformed thy home , whipped thy children , and mended thine own vile manners , thou graceless churl ! Or hadst thou taken Sister Mary Rebecca , she would have brought the place about thine ears , telling thy wife fine tales of thine unfaithfulness ; whispering that Mary Antony is younger and fairer than she . But , nay , forsooth ! Neither of these will do ! Thou must needs snatch away the Reverend Mother , Herself ! Oh , sacrilegious fiend ! Stand not there mocking me ! Where is the Reverend Mother ? "
10746	10756	10758	10759	the Prioress	373	" Why , here am I , dear Antony , "
10906	10914	10916	10917	the Prioress	373	" Nay , rise , dear Antony , "
10921	10971	10916	10917	the Prioress	373	" Rise ! I command it . The day is warm . Thou hast been dreaming . No bold , bad man has forced his way within these walls . No ' Knight of the Bloody Vest ' is here . Rise up and look . We are alone . "
10999	11008	10983	10983	herself	103	" The bold , bad man is there ! "
11034	11038	11073	11074	The Prioress	373	" Bloody Vest . "
11083	11091	11092	11092	she	373	" Now sit thee here beside me , "
11095	11135	11092	11092	she	373	" and make full confession . Ease thine old heart by telling me the entire tale . Then I will pass sentence on the robin if , true to his name , he turns out to be a thief . "
11452	11456	11457	11457	she	373	" Dear Antony , "
11460	11470	11457	11457	she	373	" is that thy posy lying at our feet ? "
11471	11477	11479	11483	the old lay - sister	264	" Ah , Reverend Mother , "
11485	11553	11479	11483	the old lay - sister	264	" in this did I again do wrong meaning to do right . Sister Mary Augustine , coming into the kitchens with leave , from Mother Sub - Prioress , to make the pasties , and desiring to be free to make them heavy unhampered by my advice which , of a surety , would have helped them to lightness bade me go out and weed the garden .
11554	11629	11653	11653	she	373	" Weeding , I bethought me how much liefer I would be gathering a posy of choicest flowers for our sweet Lady 's shrine ; and , thus thinking , I began to do , not according to Sister Mary Augustine 's hard task , but according to mine own heart 's promptings . Yet , when the posy was finished , alack - a - day ! it was a posy of weeds ! "
11659	11666	11667	11667	she	373	" Our Lady shall have it , "
11670	11710	11667	11667	she	373	" I will place it before her shrine , in mine own cell . She will understand knowing how often , though the hands perforce do weeding , yet , all the time , the heart is gathering choicest flowers .
11711	11776	11777	11778	The Prioress	373	" Aye , and sometimes when we bring to God offerings of fairest flowers , He sees but worthless weeds . And , when we mourn , because we have but weeds to offer , He sees them fragrant blossoms . Whatever , to the eye of man , the hand may hold , God sees therein the bouquet of the heart 's intention . "
11807	11816	11817	11817	she	373	" And , after all , dear Antony , "
11820	11918	11817	11817	she	373	" who shall decide which flowers shall be dubbed ' weeds ' ? No plant of His creation , however humble , was called a ' weed ' by the Creator . When , for man 's sin , He cursed the ground , He said : ' Thorns also and thistles shall it cause to bud . ' Well ? Sharpest thorns are found around the rose ; the thistle is the royal bloom of Scotland ; and , if our old white ass could speak her mind , doubtless she would call it King of Flowers .
11919	11950	12123	12124	The Prioress	373	" Nowhere in Holy Books , is any plant named a ' weed . ' It is left to man to proclaim that the flowers he wants not , are weeds .
11951	11983	11817	11817	she	373	" Look at each one of these . Could you or I , labouring for years , with all our skill , make anything so perfect as the meanest of these weeds ?
11984	12029	12123	12124	The Prioress	373	" Nay ; they are weeds , because they grow , there where they should not be . The gorgeous scarlet poppy is a weed amid the corn . If roses overgrew the wheat , we should dub them weeds , and root them out .
12030	12071	11817	11817	she	373	" And some of us have had , perforce , so to deal with the roses in our lives ; those sweet and fragrant things which overgrew our offering of the wheat of service , our sacrifice of praise and prayer .
12072	12122	12123	12124	The Prioress	373	" Perhaps , when our weeds are all torn out , and cast in a tangled heap before His Feet , our Lord beholds in them a garland of choice blossoms . The crown of thorns on earth , may prove , in Paradise , a diadem of flowers . "
12134	12290	11817	11817	she	373	" Now , Antony , about thy games with peas . There is no wrong in keeping count with peas of those who daily walk to and from Vespers ; though , I admit , it seems to me , it were easier to count one , two , three , with folded hands , than to let fall the peas from one hand to the other , beneath thy scapulary . Howbeit , a method which would be but a pitfall to one , may prove a prop to another . So I give thee leave to continue to count with thy peas . Also the games in thy cell are harmless , and lead me to think , as already I have sometimes thought , that games with balls or rings , something in which eye guides the hand , and mind the eye , might be helpful for all , on summer evenings .
12291	12348	12353	12355	the Reverend Mother	93	" But I can not have thee take upon thyself to decide the future state of the White Ladies . Who art thou , to send me to Paradise with a fillip of thine old finger - nail , yet to keep our excellent Sub - Prioress in Purgatory ? Shame upon thee , Mary Antony ! "
12368	12437	12364	12364	her	93	" So no more of that , my Antony ; though , truth to tell , thy story gives me relief , answering a question I was meaning to put to thee . I heard , not an hour ago , that Sister Antony had boasted that with a turn of her thumb and finger she could , any night , send Mother Sub - Prioress to Purgatory . "
12438	12445	12447	12448	Mary Antony	85	" Who said that of me ? "
12450	12458	12447	12448	Mary Antony	85	" Who said it , Reverend Mother ? "
12459	12464	12466	12467	the Prioress	373	" A little bird , "
12469	12516	12466	12467	the Prioress	373	" A little bird , dear Antony ; but not thy pretty robin . Also , the boast was taken to mean poison in the broth of Mother Sub - Prioress . Hast thou ever put harmful things in the broth of Mother Sub - Prioress ? "
12524	12580	12581	12581	Hastily	118	" Only beans , Reverend Mother , castor beans ; and , when her temper was vilest , purging herbs . Nothing more , I swear it ! Old Antony knows naught of poisons ; only of mixing balsams ah , ha ! and soothing ointments ! Our blessed Lady knows the tale is false . "
12596	12601	12602	12602	she	373	" I believe thee , "
12612	12652	12602	12602	she	373	" Rise from thy knees . But , remember , I forbid thee to put aught into Mother Sub - Prioress 's broth , save things that soothe and comfort . Give me thy word for this , Antony . "
12673	12680	12681	12681	she	430	" I promise , Reverend Mother , "
12684	12694	12681	12681	she	430	" and I do repent me of my sin . "
12695	12700	12702	12703	the Prioress	373	" Sit beside me , "
12705	12766	12702	12703	the Prioress	373	" I have more to say to thee . . . . Think not hard thoughts of the Sub - Prioress . She is stern , and extreme to mark what is done amiss , but this she conceives to be her duty . She is a most pious Lady . Her zeal is but a sign of her piety . "
12804	12812	12813	12813	she	373	" Mother Sub - Prioress is sick , "
12816	12856	12813	12813	she	373	" The cold struck her last evening , after sunset , in the orchard . I have bidden her to keep her bed awhile . We must tend her kindly , Antony , and help her back to health again .
12857	12930	13073	13074	the Prioress	373	" Sister Mary Rebecca is also sick , with pains in her bones and slight fever . She too keeps her bed to - day . Strive to feel kindly toward her , Antony . I know she oft thinks evil where none was meant , telling tales of wrong which are mostly of her own imagining . But , in so doing , she harms herself more than she can harm others .
12931	12969	12813	12813	she	373	" By stirring up the mud in a dark pool , you dim the reflection of the star which , before , shone bright within it . But you do not dim the star , shining on high .
12970	12996	13073	13074	the Prioress	373	" So is it with the slanderous thoughts of evil minds . They stir up their own murkiness ; but they fail to dim the stars .
12997	13006	12813	12813	she	373	" We must bear with Sister Mary Rebecca . "
13007	13016	13018	13019	old Antony	85	" Go not nigh them , Reverend Mother , "
13021	13070	13018	13019	old Antony	85	" I will tend them with due care and patience . These pains in bones , and general shiverings , are given quickly from one to another . I pray you , go not near . Remember you were taken alas ! alas ! and they were left ! "
13079	13117	13125	13129	the old lay - sister	264	" But I was not taken decently , with pains in my bones and a - bed , dear Antony . I was carried off by a bold , bad man thy Knight of the Bloody Vest . "
13118	13123	13125	13129	the old lay - sister	264	" Oh , pray ! "
13131	13183	13125	13129	the old lay - sister	264	" I fear me it is an omen . The angel Gabriel , Reverend Mother , sent to bear you from earth to heaven . ' The one shall be taken , and the other left . ' Ah , if he had but flown off with Mother Sub - Prioress ! "
13189	13411	13184	13185	The Prioress	373	" Dear Antony , thy little bird took the first pea he saw . Had there but been a crumb , or a morsel of cheese , he would have left thee thy white pea . . . Hark how he sings his little song of praise ! . . . Is it not wonderful to call to mind how , centuries ago , when white - robed Druids cut mistletoe from British oaks , the robin redbreast hopped around , and sang ; when , earlier still , men were wild and savage , dwelling in holes and caves and huts of mud , when churches and cloisters were unknown in this land and the one true God undreamed of , robins mated and made their nests , the speckled thrushes sang , ' Do it now Do it now , ' as they sought food for their young , the blackbirds whistled , and the swallows flashed by on joyous wing . Aye , and when Eve and Adam walked in Eden , amid strange beasts and gaily plumaged birds , here in these Isles the robin redbreast sang , and all our British birds busily built their nests and reared their young ; living their little joyous lives , as He Who made them taught them how to do .
13412	13493	13184	13185	The Prioress	373	" And , in the centuries to come , when all things may be changed in this our land , when we shall long have gone to dust , when our loved cloisters may have crumbled into ruin ; still the hills of Malvern will stand , and the silvery Severn flow along the valley ; while here , in this very garden if it be a garden still the robin will build his nest , and carol his happy song .
13494	13612	13184	13185	The Prioress	373	" Mark you this , dear Mary Antony : all things made by man hold within them the elements of change and of decay . But nature is at one with God , and therefore immutable . Earthly kingdoms may rise and wane ; mighty cities may spring up , then fall into ruin . Nations may conquer and , in their turn , be conquered . Man may slay man and , in his turn , be slain . But , through it all , the mountains stand , the rivers flow , the forests wave , and the redbreast builds his nest in the hawthorn , and warbles a love - song to his mate . "
13634	13646	13647	13647	she	373	" Oh , to be one with God and with Nature ! "
13650	13670	13647	13647	she	373	" Oh , to know the essential mysteries of Life and Light and Love ! This is Life Eternal ! "
13782	13787	13788	13788	she	373	" Come , Antony , "
13791	13825	13788	13788	she	373	" let us go and discover whether Sister Mary Augustine hath contrived to make the pasties light and savoury , even without the aid of the advice she might have had from thee . "
13941	13953	13954	13954	she	373	" That ' little bird ' shall have the castor beans , "
13957	13976	13954	13954	she	373	" That ' little bird ' shall have them . Not my pretty robin , but the other ! "
14108	14113	14114	14114	she	373	" Mother of God , "
14117	14351	14114	14114	she	373	" help this poor aching heart ; still the wild hunger at my breast . Make me content to be at one with the Divine , and to let Nature go . . . . Thou knowest it is not the man I want . In all the long years since he played traitor to his troth to me , I have not wanted the man . The woman he we d may have him , unbegrudged by me . I do not envy her the encircling of his arms , though time was when I felt them strong and tender . I do not want the man , but O , sweet Mother of God I want the man 's little child ! I envy her the motherhood which , but for her , would have been mine . . . . I want the soft dark head against my breast . . . . I want sweet baby lips drawing fresh life from mine . . . . I want the little feet , resting together in my hand . . . . All Nature sings of life , and the power to bestow life . Yet mine arms are empty , and my strength does but carry mine own self to and fro . . . . Oh , give me grace to turn my thoughts from Life to Sacrifice . "
14512	14519	14520	14520	she	373	" O , Mother of God , "
14523	14555	14520	14520	she	373	" grant unto me to love the pierced feet of thy dear Son crucified , more than I love the little , baby feet of the Infant Jesus on thy knees . "
14708	14732	14704	14704	she	91	" The Lord seeth not as man seeth : for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the Lord looketh on the heart .
14733	14749	14704	14704	she	91	" And , after all , this miracle of the Divine perception doth take place daily .
14750	14769	14704	14704	she	91	" Alas , when our vaunted roses and lilies appear , in His sight , as mere worthless weeds .
14770	14778	14704	14704	she	91	" The Lord looketh on the heart . "
15329	15331	15325	15325	she	102	" Wilfred "
15662	15668	15669	15669	she	85	" Oh , Reverend Mother ! "
15738	15782	15734	15734	She	373	" How now , Mary Antony ! Why this unseemly haste ? Why this rush into my presence ; no knock ; no pause until I bid thee enter ? Is the storm - fiend at thy heels ? Now shame upon thee ! "
15826	15832	15833	15833	she	373	" Have the Ladies returned ? "
15977	15985	15986	15986	she	373	" What is it , dear Antony ? "
15989	15995	15997	16001	the old lay - sister	264	" Twenty White Ladies went , "
16003	16014	15997	16001	the old lay - sister	264	" I counted them . Twenty White Ladies went ; but "
16015	16018	16053	16054	the Prioress	373	" Well ? "
16019	16025	16027	16028	Mary Antony	85	" Twenty - one returned , "
16137	16143	16145	16146	the Prioress	373	" What means this story ? "
16148	16156	16126	16126	she	373	" Reverend Mother , twenty holy Ladies went "
16157	16165	16126	16126	she	373	" I know . And twenty returned . "
16166	16169	16171	16173	the old woman	430	" Aye , "
16183	16226	16171	16173	the old woman	430	" twenty returned ; and twenty peas I dropped from hand to hand . Then when no pea remained yet another White Lady glided by ; and with her went an icy wind , and around her came the blackness of the storm .
16227	16343	16126	16126	she	373	" Down the steps I fled , locked the door , and took the key . How I mounted again , I know not . As I drew level with the cloisters , I saw that twenty - first White Lady , for whom Saint Peter knows I held no pea , passing from the cloisters into the cell passage . As I hastened on , fain to see whither she went , a blinding flash , like an evil twisting snake , shot betwixt her and me . When I could see again , she was gone . I fled to the Reverend Mother , and ran in on the roar of the thunder . "
16344	16353	16171	16173	the old woman	430	" Saw you her face , Mary Antony ? "
16354	16376	16126	16126	she	373	" Nay , Reverend Mother . But , of late , the holy Ladies mostly walk by with their faces shrouded . "
16377	16400	16171	16173	the old woman	430	" I know . Now , see here , dear Antony . Two peas dropped together , the while you counted one . "
16401	16433	16126	16126	she	373	" Nay , Reverend Mother . Twenty peas dropped one by one ; also I counted twenty White Ladies . And , after I had counted twenty , yet another passed . "
16434	16441	16443	16444	the Prioress	373	" But how could that be ? "
16446	16464	16443	16444	the Prioress	373	" If twenty went , but twenty could return . Who should be the twenty - first ? "
16475	16479	16480	16480	she	85	" Sister Agatha , "
16485	16494	16480	16480	she	85	" Poor Sister Agatha returned to us again . "
16529	16541	16544	16544	Seraphine	102	" Wilfred ! Wilfred , are you come to save me ? "
16848	16855	16857	16858	the Prioress	373	" Now listen , dear Antony , "
16868	16908	16857	16858	the Prioress	373	" I must make sure that this twenty - first White Lady of thine is but a trick played on thee by thy peas . Should she be anywhere in the Convent I shall most certainly have speech with her .
16909	16964	16865	16865	her	373	" Meanwhile , go thou to thy kitchens , and give thy mind to the preparing of the evening meal . But ring not the Refectory bell until I bid thee . Nay , I myself will sound it this evening . It may suit me to keep the nuns somewhat longer at their devotions .
16965	17051	16857	16858	the Prioress	373	" Should I sound the alarm bell , let all thy helpers run up here ; but go thou to the cell of Mother Sub - Prioress and persuade her not to rise . If needful say that it is my command that she keep her bed . . . . Great heavens ! What a crash ! May our Lady defend us ! The lightning inclines to strike . I shall pass to each cell and make sure that none are too greatly alarmed . "
17052	17084	17085	17086	the Prioress	373	" Now , haste thee , Antony ; and not a word concerning thy fears must pass thy lips to any ; no mention of a twenty - first White Lady nor "
17089	17103	17085	17086	the Prioress	373	" of Sister Agatha , to whom may our Lord grant everlasting rest . "
17130	17146	17122	17122	she	85	" The Lord defend you , Reverend Mother , from foes , seen and unseen , "
17880	17891	17852	17878	the only ears that heard it , like the Voice of Power on Galilee , which bid the tempest cease , and the wild waves be still	729	" Who art thou , and what doest thou here ? "
17897	17915	17916	17917	The figure	730	" Art thou a ghostly visitor come back amongst us , from the Realm of the Unseen ? "
17922	17935	17916	17917	The figure	730	" Art thou then flesh and blood , and mortal as ourselves ? "
17943	17981	17937	17938	the figure	730	" Now I adjure thee by our blessed Lady to tell me truly . Art thou , in very deed a holy nun , a member of our sacred Order ? Answer me , yea or nay ? "
18020	18029	18030	18030	she	373	" Then , masquerader in our sacred dress , "
18033	18132	18030	18030	she	373	" to me you have to answer for double sacrilege : the wearing of these robes , and your presence here , unbidden . I warn you that your life has never hung by frailer thread than now it hangs . Your only hope of safety lies in doing as I bid you . Pass before me along this passage until you reach a chamber on the right , of which the door stands open . Enter , and place yourself against the wall on the side farthest from the door . There I will speak with you . "
18319	18326	18311	18311	she	91	" I KNOW YOU FOR A MAN "
18547	18555	18556	18556	she	91	" I know you for a man , "
18629	18637	18638	18638	she	91	" I know you for a man , "
18642	18741	18638	18638	she	91	" You stand there , revealed ; and surely you stand there , shamed . By plotting and planning , by assuming our dress , you have succeeded in forcing your undesired presence into this sacred cloister , where dwells a little company of women who have left the world , never to return to it again ; who have given up much in order to devote themselves to a life of continual worship and adoration , gaining thereby a power in intercession which brings down blessing upon those who still fight life 's battles in the world without .
18742	18802	18858	18859	The Prioress	373	" But it has meant the breaking of many a tender tie . There are fathers and brothers dear to them , whom the nuns would love to see again ; but they can not do so , save , on rare occasions , in the guest - room at the gate ; and then , with the grille between .
18803	18828	18638	18638	she	91	" Saving Bishop or Priest , no foot of man may tread our cloisters ; no voice of man may be heard in these cells .
18829	18857	18858	18859	The Prioress	373	" Yet by trick and subterfuge you have intruded . Methinks I scarce should let you leave this place alive , to boast what you have done . "
18899	18903	18896	18897	Mary Seraphine	102	" Cousin Wilfred . "
18937	18945	18946	18946	she	373	" I know you , Sir Wilfred , "
18949	19048	18946	18946	she	373	" And I know why you are here . You have come to tempt away , or mayhap , if possible , to force away one of our number who but lately took her final vows . There was a time , not long ago , when you might have thwarted her desire to seek and find the best and highest . But now you come too late . No bride of Heaven turns from her high estate . Her choice is made . She will abide by it ; and so , Sir Knight , must you . "
19076	19163	19071	19071	her	373	" I know the disappointment to you must be grievous . You took great risks ; you adventured much . How long you have plotted this intrusion , I know not . You have been thwarted in your evil purpose by the faithfulness of one old woman , our aged lay - sister , Mary Antony , who never fails to count the White Ladies as they go and as they return , and who reported at once to me that one more had returned than went .
19164	19198	19071	19071	her	373	" Do you not see in this the Hand of God ? Will you not bow in penitence before Him , confessing the sinfulness of the thing you had in mind to do ? "
19258	19264	19265	19265	she	91	" Shew me thy face , "
19361	19364	19366	19367	the Prioress	91	" Hugh ! "
19376	19379	19366	19367	the Prioress	91	" Hugh ? "
19416	19419	19394	19394	her	91	" Hugh ! "
19449	19452	19454	19455	the Prioress	91	" Back ! "
19468	19473	19474	19474	she	91	" Come no nearer , "
19748	19758	19759	19759	she	91	" Thou wilt come back to me , Hugh , "
19762	19793	19759	19759	she	91	" The Saracens will not slay thee , will not wound thee , will not touch thee . My love will ever be around thee , as a silver shield . "
19830	19857	19817	19817	He	764	" I would I left thee wife , not maid . Could I have we d thee first , I would go with a lighter heart . "
19858	19863	19864	19864	she	91	" Wife or maid , "
19873	19912	19864	19864	she	91	" I am all thine own . Go with a light heart , dear man of mine , for it makes no difference . Maid or wife , I am thine , and none other 's , forever . "
19913	19925	19926	19926	he	764	" Let those be the last words I hear thee say , "
19971	19976	19977	19977	she	91	" Maid or wife , "
19991	20005	19977	19977	she	91	" Maid or wife , God knows , I am all thine own . "
20015	20024	20025	20025	she	91	" Thine and none other 's , forever , "
20129	20138	20152	20152	her	91	" Thine and none other 's , forever . "
20244	20250	20251	20251	she	373	" So it is you , "
20254	20257	20259	20260	the Knight	764	" Yes , "
20262	20266	20259	20260	the Knight	764	" it is I. "
20286	20300	20280	20281	the Prioress	373	" How did you dare to force your way into this sacred cloister ? "
20305	20318	20301	20302	The Knight	764	" I have yet to find the thing I dare not do . "
20319	20328	20330	20331	the Prioress	91	" Why are you not with your wife ? "
20339	20346	20348	20349	the Knight	764	" I am with my wife , "
20351	20372	20348	20349	the Knight	764	" The only wife I have ever wanted , the only woman I shall ever we d , is here . "
20373	20376	20378	20379	the Prioress	373	" Coward ! "
20385	20388	20389	20389	She	373	" Traitor ! "
20402	20422	20389	20389	She	373	" Liar ! You wedded your cousin , Alfrida , less than one year after you went from me . "
20423	20429	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Cease to be angry , "
20434	20465	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Thine anger affrights me not , yet it hurts thyself . Listen , mine own beloved , and I will tell thee the cruel , and yet blessed , truth .
20466	20530	20389	20389	She	373	" Seven months after I left thee , a messenger reached our camp , bearing letters from England ; no word for me from thee ; but a long missive from thy half - sister Eleanor , breaking to me the news that , being weary of my absence , and somewhat over - persuaded , thou hadst wedded Humphry ; Earl of Carnforth .
20531	20567	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" It was no news to me , that Humphry sought to win thee ; but , that thou hadst let thyself be won away from thy vow to me , was hell 's own tidings .
20568	20672	20389	20389	She	373	" In my first rage of grief I would have speech with none . But , by - and - by , I sought the messenger , and asked him casually of things at home . He told me he had seen thy splendid nuptials with the lord of Carnforth , had been present at the marriage , and joined in the after revels and festivities . He said thou didst make a lovely bride , but somewhat sad , as if thy mind strayed elsewhere . The fellow was a kind of lawyer 's clerk , but lean , and out at elbow .
20673	20749	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Then I sought ' Frida , my cousin . She too had had a letter , giving the news . She told me she long had feared this thing for me , knowing the heart of Humphry to be set on winning thee , and that Eleanor approved his suit , and having already heard that of late thou hadst inclined to smile on him . She begged me to do nothing rash or hasty .
20750	20845	20389	20389	She	373	" ' What good were it , ' she said , ' to beg the King for leave to hasten home ? If you kill Humphry , Hugh , you do but make a widow of the woman you have loved ; nor could you we d the widow of a man yourself had slain . If Humphry kills you well , a valiant arm is lost to the Holy Cause , and other hearts , more faithful than hers , may come nigh to breaking . Stay here , and play the man . '
20846	20957	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" So , by the messenger , I sent thee back a letter , asking thee to write me word how it was that thou , being my betrothed , hadst come to do this thing ; and whether Humphry was good to thee , and making thy life pleasant . To Humphry I sent a letter saying that , thy love being round him as a silver shield , I would not slay him , wound him , or touch him ! But if he used thee ill , or gave thee any grief or sorrow , then would I come , forthwith , and send him straight to hell .
20958	20983	20389	20389	She	373	" These letters , with others from the camp , went back to England by that clerkly messenger . No answers were returned to mine .
20984	20997	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Meanwhile I went , with my despair , out to the battlefield .
20998	21035	20389	20389	She	373	" No tender shield was round me any more . I fought , like a mad wild beast . So often was I wounded , that they dubbed me ' The Knight of the Bloody Vest . '
21036	21130	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" At last they brought me back to camp , delirious and dying . My cousin ' Frida , there biding her time , nursed me back to life , and sought to win for herself I shame to say it the love which thou hadst flouted . I need not tell thee , my cousin ' Frida failed . The Queen herself as good as bid me we d her favourite Lady . The Queen herself had to discover that she could command an English soldier 's life , but not his love .
21131	21160	20389	20389	She	373	" Back in the field again , I found myself one day , cut off , surrounded , hewn down , taken prisoner ; but by a generous foe .
21161	21263	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Thereafter followed years of much adventure ; escapes , far distant wanderings , strange company . Many months I spent in a mountain fastness with a wise Hebrew Rabbi , who taught me his sacred Scriptures ; going back to the beginning of all things , before the world was ; yet shrewd in judgment of the present , and throwing a weird light forward upon the future . A strange man ; wise , as are all of that Chosen Race ; and a faithful friend . He did much to heal my hurt and woo me back to sanity .
21264	21371	20389	20389	She	373	" Later , more than a year with a band of holy monks in a desert monastery , high among the rocks ; good Fathers who believed in Greek and Latin as surest of all balsams for a wounded spirit , and who made me to become deeply learned in Apostolic writings , and in the teachings of the Church . But , for all their best endeavours , I could not feel called to the perpetual calm of the Cloister . We are a line of fighters and hunters , men to whom pride of race and love of hearth and home , are primal instincts .
21372	21472	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Thus , after many further wanderings and much varying adventure , having by a strange chance heard news of the death of my father , and that my mother mourned . In solitude , the opening of this year found me landed in England I who , by most , had long been given up for dead ; though Martin Goodfellow , failing to find trace of me in Palestine , had gone back to Cumberland , and staunchly maintained his belief that I lived , a captive , and should some day make my escape , and return .
21473	21560	20389	20389	She	373	" I passed with all speed to our Castle on the moors , knowing a mother 's heart waited here , for mothers never cease to watch and hope . And , sure enough , as I rode up , the great doors flew wide ; the house waited its master ; the mother was on the threshold to greet her son . Aye ! It was good to be at home once more even in the land where my woman was bearing children to another man .
21561	21617	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" We spent a few happy days , I and my mother , together . Then the joy of hope fulfilled being sometimes a swifter harbinger to another world than the heaviest load of sorrow she passed , without pain or sickness , smiling , in her sleep ; she passed leaving my home desolate indeed .
21618	21688	20389	20389	She	373	" Not having known of my betrothal to thee , because of the old feud between our families , and my reluctance to cross her wish that I should we d Alfrida , thy name was not spoken between us ; but I learned from her that my cousin ' Frida lay dying at her manor , nigh to Chester , of some lingering disease contracted in eastern lands . "
21689	21798	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" With the first stirrings of Spring in forest and pasture , I felt moved to ride south to the Court , and report my return to the King ; yet waited , strangely loath to go abroad where any turn of the road might bring me face to face with Humphry . I doubted , should we meet , if I could pass , without slaying him , the man who had stolen my betrothed from me . So I stayed in my own domain , bringing things into order , working in the armoury , and striving by hard exercise to throttle the grim demon of despair .
21799	21822	20389	20389	She	373	" April brought a burst of early summer ; and , on the first day of May , I set off for Windsor .
21823	21899	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Passing through Carnforth on my way , I found the town keeping high holiday . I asked the reason , and was told of a Tourney now in progress in the neighbourhood , to which the Earl had that morning ridden in state , accompanied by his Countess , who indeed was chosen Queen of Beauty , and was to sit enthroned , attended by her little daughter , two tiny sons acting as pages .
21900	21938	20389	20389	She	373	" A sudden mad desire came on me , to look upon thy face again ; to see thee with the man who stole thee from me ; with the children , who should have been mine own .
21939	21972	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Ten minutes later , I rode on to the field . Pushing in amid the gay crowd , I seemed almost at once to find myself right in front of the throne .
21973	22049	20389	20389	She	373	" I saw the Queen of Beauty , in cloth of gold . I saw the little maiden and the pages in attendance . I saw Humphry , proud husband and father , beside them . All this I saw , which I had come to see . But the face of Humphry 's Countess was not thy face ! In that moment I knew that , for seven long years , I had been fooled !
22050	22065	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" I started on a frenzied quest after the truth , and news of thee .
22066	22127	20389	20389	She	373	" Thy sister Eleanor had died the year before . To thy beautiful castle and lands , so near mine own , Eleanor 's son had succeeded , and ruled there in thy stead . He being at Court just then , I saw him not , nor could I hear direct news of thee , though rumour said a convent .
22128	22220	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Then I remembered my cousin , Alfrida , lying sick at her manor in Chester . To her I went ; and , walking in unannounced I , whom she had long thought dead I forced the truth from her . The whole plot stood revealed . She and Eleanor had hatched it between them . Eleanor desiring thy lands for herself and her boy , and knowing children of thine would put hers out of succession ; Alfrida it shames me to say it desiring for herself , thy lover .
22221	22353	20389	20389	She	373	" The messenger who brought the letters was bribed to give details of thy supposed marriage . On his return to England , my letters to thee and to Humphry he handed to Eleanor ; also a lying letter from ' Frida , telling of her marriage with me , with the Queen 's consent and approval , and asking Eleanor to break the news to thee . The messenger then mingled with thy household , describing my nuptials in detail , as , when abroad , he had done thine . Hearing of this , my poor Love did even as I had done , sent for him , questioned him , heard the full tale he had to tell , and saw , alas ! no reason to misdoubt him .
22354	22405	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" By the way , my cousin ' Frida knew where to lay her hand upon that clerkly fellow . Therefore we sent for him . He came in haste to see the Lady Alfrida , from whom , during all the years , he had extorted endless hush - money .
22406	22413	20389	20389	She	373	" I and my men awaited him .
22414	22433	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" He had fattened on his hush - money ! He was no longer lean and out at elbow .
22434	22448	20389	20389	She	373	" He screeched at sight of me , thinking me risen from the dead .
22449	22465	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" He screeched still louder when he saw the noose , flung over a strong bough .
22466	22524	20389	20389	She	373	" We left him hanging , when we rode away . That Judas kind will do the darkest deeds for greed of gain . The first of the tribe himself shewed the way by which it was most fitting to speed them from a world into which it had been good for them never to have been born .
22525	22555	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" From Alfrida I learned that , as Eleanor had foreseen , thy grief at my perfidy drove thee to the Cloister . Also that thy Convent was near Worcester .
22556	22621	20389	20389	She	373	" To Worcester I came , and made myself known to the Lord Bishop , with whom I supped ; and finding him most pleasant to talk with , and ready to understand , deemed it best , in perfect frankness , to tell him the whole matter ; being careful not to mention thy name , nor to give any clue to thy person .
22622	22735	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Through chance remarks let fall by the Bishop while giving me the history of the Order , I learned that already thou wert Prioress of the White Ladies . ' The youngest Prioress in the kingdom , ' said the Bishop , ' yet none could be wiser or better fitted to hold high authority . ' Little did he dream that any mention of thee was as water to the parched desert ; yet he talked on , for love of speaking of thee , while I sat praying he might tell me more ; yet barely answering yea or nay , seeming to be absorbed in mine own melancholy thoughts .
22736	22771	20389	20389	She	373	" From the Bishop I learned that the Order was a strictly close one , and that no man could , on any pretext whatsoever , gain speech alone with one of the White Ladies .
22772	22798	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" But I also heard of the underground way leading from the Cathedral to the Convent , and of the daily walk to and from Vespers .
22799	22979	20389	20389	She	373	" I went to the crypt , and saw the doorway through which the White Ladies pass . Standing unseen amid the many pillars , I daily watched the long line of silent figures , noted that they all walked veiled , with faces hidden , keeping a measured distance apart . Also that several were above usual height . Then I conceived the plan of wearing the outer dress , and of stepping in amongst those veiled figures just at the foot of the winding stair in the wall , leading down from the clerestory to the crypt . I marked that the nun descending , could not keep in view the nun in front who had just stepped forth into the crypt ; while she , moving forward , would not perceive it if , slipping from behind a pillar , another white figure silently joined the procession behind her . Once within the Convent , I trusted to our Lady to help me to speech alone with thee ; and our blessed Lady hath not failed me .
22980	22988	20431	20432	the Knight	764	" Now I have told thee all . "
23156	23159	23160	23160	she	373	" Alas , "
23163	23179	23160	23160	she	373	" the pity of it ! Ah , the cruel , cruel pity of it ! "
23208	23219	23220	23220	he	764	" But , my beloved , I have found thee , "
23271	23276	23278	23279	the Prioress	373	" Touch me not , "
23287	23292	23293	23293	he	764	" You are mine , "
23296	23346	23293	23293	he	764	" Mine to have and to keep . During these wretched years we have schooled ourselves each to think of the other as wedded . Now we know that neither has been faithless . I have found thee , my beloved , and I will not let thee go . "
23347	23350	23352	23353	the Prioress	373	" Hugh , "
23355	23387	23352	23353	the Prioress	373	" I am wedded . You come too late . Saw you not the sacred ring upon my hand ? Know you not that every nun is the bride of Christ ? "
23388	23393	23401	23401	he	764	" You are mine ! "
23421	23430	23431	23431	she	373	" Before I went to the cloister door , "
23434	23525	23431	23431	she	373	" I took this from its hiding - place , and put it in my girdle . I guessed I had a man to deal with ; though , Heaven knows , I dreamed not it was thou ! But I tell thee , Hugh , if thou , or any man , attempt to lay defiling touch upon any nun in this Priory myself , or another I strike , and I strike home . This blade will be driven up to the hilt in the offender 's heart . "
23548	23554	23555	23555	he	764	" Put back thy weapon , "
23560	23596	23555	23555	he	764	" into its hiding - place . No other man is here ; yet , should another come , my sword would well suffice to guard thine honour , and the honour of thy nuns . "
23621	23626	23627	23627	she	802	" Yes , Hugh , "
23630	23641	23627	23627	she	802	" That much of trust indeed I owe thy love . "
23801	23803	23809	23809	she	802	" Prioress "
23864	23868	23869	23869	she	802	" Sir Hugh , "
23872	24066	23869	23869	she	802	" my dear Knight , whom I ever found brave and tender , and whom I now know to have been always loyal and true there is no need that I should add a word to your recital . The facts you wrung from Alfrida God grant forgiveness to that tormented heart are all true . Believing the messenger , not dreaming of doubting Eleanor , my one thought was to hide from the world my broken heart , my shattered pride . I hastened to offer to God the love and the life which had been slighted by man . I confess this has since seemed to me but a poor second - best to have brought to Him , Who indeed should have our very best . But , daily kneeling at His Feet , I said : ' A broken and a contrite heart , Lord , Thou wilt not despise . ' My heart was ' broken , ' when I brought it here . It has been ' contrite ' since . And well I know , although so far from worthy , it has not been despised . "
24082	24088	24089	24089	she	812	" Our blessed Lady interceded , "
24104	24104	24089	24089	she	812	"
24157	24170	24230	24230	her	812	" I think it right that you should know , dear Hugh , "
24179	24216	24230	24230	her	812	" that , at first , I suffered greatly . I spent long agonizing nights , kneeling before our Lady 's shrine , imploring strength to conquer the love and the longing which had become sin . "
24241	24247	24248	24248	she	812	" And strength was given , "
24254	24257	24259	24260	the Knight	764	" Mora ! "
24275	24377	24272	24272	her	764	" You prayed for strength to conquer , when you thought it sin ; just as I rode out to meet the foe , to fight and slay , and afterward wrestled with unknown tongues , doing all those things which were hardest , while striving to quench my love for you . But when I knew that no other man had right to you or ever had had right , why then I found that nothing had slain my love , nor ever could . And Mora , now you know that I am free , is your love dead ? "
24409	24414	24415	24415	she	764	" Listen , Hugh , "
24418	24481	24415	24415	she	764	" If , thinking me faithless , you had turned for consolation to another ; if , though you brought her but your second best , you yet had won and we d her ; now , finding after all that I had not wedded Humphry , would you leave your bride , and try to wake again your love for me ? "
24482	24489	24490	24490	he	820	" You seek to place me , "
24493	24526	24490	24490	he	820	" in straits in which , by mine own act , I shall never be . Loving you as I love you , I could we d no other while you live . "
24533	24542	24415	24415	she	764	" But , if , Hugh ? If ? "
24543	24548	24549	24549	he	820	" Then , no , "
24552	24563	24549	24549	he	820	" I should not leave one I had we d. But "
24564	24567	24568	24568	she	821	" Hugh , "
24571	24604	24568	24568	she	821	" thinking you faithless , I took the holy vows which wedded me to Heaven . How can I leave my heavenly Bridegroom , for love of any man upon this earth ? "
24605	24612	24613	24613	he	820	" Not ' any man , ' "
24616	24855	24613	24613	he	820	" but your betrothed , returned to claim you ; the man to whom you said as parting words : ' Maid or wife , I am all thine own ; thine and none other 's forever . ' Ah , that brings the warm blood to thy cheek ! Oh , my Heart 's Life , if it was true then , it is true still ! God is not a man that he should lie , or rob another of his bride . If I had we d another woman , I should have done that thing , honestly believing thee the wife of another man . But , all these years , while thou and I were both deceived , He , Who knoweth all , has known the truth . He knew thee betrothed to me . He heard thee say , upon the battlements , when last we stood together : ' God knows , I am all thine own . ' He knew how , when I thought I had lost thee , I yet lived faithful to the pure memory of our love . The day thy vows were made , He knew that I was free , and thou , therefore , still pledged to me . Shall a man rob God ? Ay , he may . But shall God rob a man ? Nay , then , never ! "
24875	24881	24882	24882	she	822	" Holy Mother of God , "
24885	24919	24882	24882	she	822	" teach him that I dare not do this thing ! Shew him that I can not break my vows . Help him to understand that I would not , if I could . "
24939	24943	24944	24944	he	825	" Blessed Virgin , "
24947	25015	24944	24944	he	825	" Thou who didst dwell in the earthly home at Nazareth , help this woman of mine to understand , that if she break her troth to me , holding herself from me , now when I am come to claim her , she sends me forth to an empty life , to a hearth beside which no woman will sit , to a home forever desolate . "
25166	25171	25172	25172	she	827	" Ah , Hugh , "
25188	25188	25172	25172	she	827	"
25211	25214	25215	25215	he	764	" Mora , "
25233	25274	25219	25219	his	764	" far be it from me to tempt you . I will plead with you but once again , in presence of our Lady and of the Holy Child ; and , having so done , I will say no more .
25275	25397	25219	25219	his	764	" I ask you to leave this place , which you would never have entered had you known your lover was yours , and needing you . I ask you to keep your plighted word to me , and to become my wife . If you refuse , I go , returning not again . I leave you here , to kneel in peace , by night or day , before the shrine of the Madonna . But I bid you to remember , day and night , that because of this which you have done , there can be no Madonna in my home . No woman will ever sit beside my hearth , holding a little child upon her knees .
25398	25464	25219	25219	his	764	" You leave to me the crucifix heart broken , love betrayed ; feet and hands nailed to the wood of cruel circumstance ; side pierced by spear of treachery lonely , forsaken . But you take from me all the best , both in life and in religion ; all that tells of love , of joy , of hope for the years to come .
25465	25548	25219	25219	his	764	" Oh , my beloved , weigh it well ! There are so many , with a true vocation , serving Heaven in Convent and in Cloister . There is but one woman in the whole world for me . In the sight of Heaven , nothing divides us . Convent walls now stand between but they were built by man , not God . Vows of celibacy were not meant to sunder loving hearts . Mora ? . . . Come ! "
25556	25562	25563	25563	she	373	" I can not come , "
25566	25736	25563	25563	she	373	" That which I have taught to others , I must myself perform . Hugh , I am dead to the world ; and if I be dead to the world , how can I live to you ? Had I , in very deed , died and been entombed , you would not have gone down into the vaults and forced my resting - place , that you might look upon my face , clasp my cold hand , and pour into deaf ears a tale of love . Yet that is what , by trick and artifice , you now have done . You come to a dead woman , saying ; ' Love me , and be my wife . ' She must , perforce , make answer : ' How shall I , who am dead to the world , live any longer therein ? ' Take a wife from among the Living , Hugh . Come not to seek a bride among the Dead . "
25737	25742	25744	25745	the Knight	764	" Mother of God ! "
25747	25752	25744	25745	the Knight	764	" is this religion ? "

25814	25883	25811	25811	she	834	" I dare not pass you out by the Convent gate . I fear me , you must go back the way you came ; nor can you go alone . We hold the key to unlock the door leading from our passage into the Cathedral crypt . I will now send all the nuns to the Refectory . Then I myself must take you to the crypt . "
25884	25891	25893	25894	the Knight	764	" Can I not walk alone , "
25898	25906	25893	25894	the Knight	764	" returning you the key by messenger ? "
25907	25910	25912	25913	the Prioress	373	" Nay , "
25915	25978	25912	25913	the Prioress	373	" I dare run no risks . So quickly rumours are afloat . To - morrow , this strange hour must be a dream ; and you and I alone , the dreamers . Now , while I go and make safe the way , put you on again the robe and hood . When I return and beckon , follow silently . "

26224	26230	26232	26234	Sister Mary Rebecca	90	" Yes , Reverend Mother , "
26661	26666	26652	26657	the radiant woman he had left	874	" Touch me not , "

27332	27436	27329	27329	he	764	" it is long since thou and I last walked together over the sunny fields , amid buttercups and cowslips , and the sweet - smelling clover . To - night we walk beneath the fields instead of through them . We are under the grass , my sweet . I seem to stand beside thee in the grave . And truly my hopes lie slain ; the promise of our love is dead , and shall soon be buried . Yet thou and I still live , and now must walk together side by side , the sad ghosts of our former selves .
27437	27492	27493	27493	His	909	" So now I ask thee , Mora , for the sake of those past walks among the flowers , to lay thy hand within my arm and walk with me in gentle fellowship , here in this place of gloom and darkness , as , long ago , we walked among the flowers . "
27946	27949	27950	27950	she	91	" Hugh , "
27953	28025	27950	27950	she	91	" I beg you , for my sake and for the sake of all whose fair fame is under my care , to pass through quickly into the crypt , and to go from thence , if possible , unseen , or in such manner as shall prevent any suspicion that you come from out this hidden way . Tales of wrong are told so readily , and so quickly grow . "
28026	28034	28036	28037	the Knight	764	" I will observe the utmost caution , "
28039	28042	28043	28043	she	91	" Hugh , "
28046	28059	28043	28043	she	91	" I grieve to have had , perforce , to disappoint you . "
28065	28091	28092	28093	The Knight	764	" This is our final farewell . Do you forgive me , Hugh ? Will you think kindly , if you ever think on me ? "
28108	28111	28112	28112	he	764	" Mora , "
28115	28226	28112	28112	he	764	" I can not as yet take thine answer as final . I will return no more , nor try to speak with thee again . But five days longer , I shall wait . I shall have plans made with the utmost care , to bear thee , in safety and unseen , from the Cathedral . I know the doors are watched , and that all who pass in and out are noted and observed . But , if thou wilt but come to me , beloved , trust me to know how to guard mine own . . . . Nay , speak not ! Hear me out .
28227	28355	28356	28356	He	940	" Daily , after Vespers , I shall stand hidden among the pillars , close to the winding stair . One step aside only one step and my arm will be around thee . A new life of love and home will lie before us . I shall take thee , safely concealed , to the hostel where I and my men now lodge . There , horses will stand ready , and we shall ride at once to Warwick . At Warwick we shall find a priest one in high favour , both in Church and State who knows all , and is prepared to we d us without delay . After which , by easy stages , my wife , I shall take thee home . "
28374	28381	28382	28382	he	940	" I shall take thee home ! "
28411	28416	28417	28417	she	941	" My poor Hugh , "
28420	28432	28417	28417	she	941	" it is useless to wait . I shall not come . "
28433	28438	28440	28441	the Knight	764	" Yet five days , "
28443	28461	28440	28441	the Knight	764	" I shall tarry in Worcester . Each day , after Vespers , I shall be here . "
28462	28515	28417	28417	she	941	" Go to - day , dear Hugh . Ride to Warwick and tell thy priest , that which indeed he should know without the telling : that a nun does not break her vows . This is our final farewell , Hugh . Thou hadst best believe it , and go . "
28516	28521	28522	28522	he	764	" Our last farewell ? "
28525	28529	28417	28417	she	941	" Our last . "
28530	28535	28417	28417	she	941	" Here and now ? "
28536	28544	28417	28417	she	941	" Here and now , dear Hugh . "
28586	28589	28590	28590	he	764	" Yes , "
28593	28605	28590	28590	he	764	" yes . It is indeed farewell here and now forever . "
28646	28651	28652	28652	she	943	" Ah , Hugh , "
28657	28671	28652	28652	she	943	" be merciful , and go ! Spare me , and go quickly . "
28717	28723	28724	28724	he	764	" Farewell , my Love , "
28727	28747	28724	28724	he	764	" Our Lady comfort thee ; and may Heaven forgive me , for that I have disturbed thy peace . "

30790	30798	30799	30799	she	85	" Listening to a wondrous romantic tale , "
30803	30813	30799	30799	she	85	" told by the Knight of the Bloody Vest . "
30814	30826	30828	30829	Mary Martha	150	" You verily are foolish about that robin , Sister Antony , "
30831	30853	30828	30829	Mary Martha	150	" and you will take your death of cold , sitting out in the garden in the damp , after sunset . "

32483	32536	32472	32472	She	373	" How kind of thee , dear Antony , to take so much thought for me . Place the bowls on the table . . . . Now draw up that stool , and stay near me while I sup . I am weary this night , and shall like thy company . "

32964	32970	32972	32973	Mary Antony	85	" Nay , Reverend Mother , "
32975	32986	32918	32918	she	373	" Did not you forbid me to speak of it ? "
32987	32990	32992	32993	the Prioress	373	" True , "
32995	33018	32992	32993	the Prioress	373	" Well , Antony , I went in the storm , to look for her ; but I found not Sister Agatha . "
33019	33025	33027	33028	Mary Antony	85	" That I already knew , "
33046	33053	33035	33036	The Prioress	373	" What mean you , Antony ? "
33073	33079	33080	33080	she	85	" Oh , Reverend Mother , "
33083	33091	33080	33080	she	85	" I have a confession to make ! "
33092	33096	33098	33099	the Prioress	373	" Make it , "
33105	33143	33098	33099	the Prioress	373	" Reverend Mother , when you sent me from you , after making my report , I went first , as commanded , to the kitchens . But afterward , in my cell , I found these . "
33180	33184	33185	33185	she	85	" Reverend Mother , "
33188	33305	33185	33185	she	85	" there were twenty - five in the bag . I thought I had counted twenty out into my hand ; so when all the peas had dropped and yet another holy Lady passed , I thought that made twenty - one . But when I found six peas in my bag , I became aware of my folly . I had but counted nineteen , and had no pea to let fall for the twentieth holy Lady . Yet I ran in haste with my false report , when , had I but thought to look in my wallet , all would have been made clear . Will the Reverend Mother forgive old Mary Antony ? "
33344	33348	33350	33352	the Reverend Mother	427	" Dear Antony , "
33356	33359	33360	33360	she	85	" Dear Antony "

33394	33416	33391	33391	she	85	" With the best of intentions , we all sometimes make mistakes . There is nothing to forgive , my Antony . "
33417	33428	33430	33433	the lay - sister	337	" I am old , and dim , and stupid , "
33437	33455	33430	33433	the lay - sister	337	" but I have begged of our sweet Lady to sharpen the old wits of Mary Antony . "
33515	33551	33501	33502	The Prioress	373	" Let us to bed , dear Antony ; then , with the dawn of a new day we shall all arise with hearts refreshed and wits more keen . So now God rest thee . "
33916	33929	33930	33930	he	764	" I have the leave of the Lord Bishop , good father , "
33933	33980	33930	33930	he	764	" to carry this man upon the stretcher daily into the crypt , and there to let him lie before the shrine of Saint Oswald , during the hour of Vespers ; from which daily pilgrimage and prayer , we hope a great recovery and restoration . "
34113	34118	34120	34122	the old man	1137	" Most worshipful Knight , "
34127	34279	34120	34122	the old man	1137	" our Lord Bishop 's mandate supersedes all rules . Were it not so , it would be my duty to clear the crypt before Vespers . See you that stairway yonder , beneath the arch ? Not many minutes hence , up those steps will pass the holy nuns from the Convent of the White Ladies at Whytstone noble ladies all , and of great repute for saintliness . Daily they come to Vespers by a secret way ; entering the crypt , they pass across to a winding stair in the wall , and so arrive at a gallery above the choir , from which they can , unseen , hear the chanting of the monks . I must to my duties above . Will you undertake , Sir Knight , that your men go not nigh where the White Ladies pass , nor in any way molest them ? "
34280	34299	34301	34302	the Knight	764	" None shall stir hand or foot , as they pass , nor in any way molest them , "
34652	34658	34660	34661	the monks	4870	" Levavi oculos meos in montes "
35485	35505	35474	35474	Antony	85	" Sister Mary Rebecca embraced by the Knight of the Bloody Vest ? Nay then ; the Saints forbid ! "
35819	35835	35837	35838	the Prioress	373	" But the point which I chiefly desire to lay before you , Reverend Father , "
35840	35954	35837	35838	the Prioress	373	" is this : If the neighing of a palfrey calls more loudly to her than the voice of God ; if her mind is still set upon the things of the world ; if she professed without a true vocation , merely because she wished to be the central figure of a great ceremony , yet was all the while expecting a man to intervene and carry her off ; if all this bespeaks her true state of heart , then to my mind there comes the question : Is she doing good , either to herself or to others , by belonging to our Order ? Would she not be better away ?
35955	36055	35799	35799	she	373	" My lord , I fear I greatly shock you by naming such a possibility . But truly I am pursued by the remembrance of that young thing , beating the floor with her hands , and singing a mournful dirge about the crimson trappings of her palfrey . And , alas ! when I reasoned with her and exhorted , she broke out , as I have told you , Reverend Father , into grievous blasphemy for which she was severely dealt with by Mother Sub - Prioress , and has since been outwardly amenable to rules and discipline .
36056	36193	35837	35838	the Prioress	373	" But , though she may outwardly conform , how about her inward state ? Well I know that our vows are lifelong vows ; all who belong to our Order are wedded to Heaven ; we are thankful to know that the calm of the Cloister shall be exchanged only for the greater peace of Paradise . But , supposing a young heart has mistaken its vocation ; supposing the voice of an earthly lover calls when it is too late ; would it seem right or possible to you , Reverend Father , to grant any sort of absolution from the vows ; tacitly to allow the opening of the cage door , that the little foolish bird might , if it wished , escape into the liberty for which it chafes and sighs ? "
36453	36459	36464	36464	he	4673	" The little foolish bird , "
36495	36631	36464	36464	he	4673	" The little foolish bird might soon wish herself back in the safety of the cage . On such as she , the cruel hawks of life do love to prey . Absorbed in the contemplation of her own charms , she sees not , until too late , the dangers which surround her . Such little foolish birds , my daughter , are best in the safe shelter of the cloister . Moreover , of what value are they in the world ? None . If Popinjays we d them , they do but hatch out broods of foolish little Popinjays . If true men , caught by mere surface beauty , we d them , it can mean naught save heartbreak and sorrow , and deterioration of the race . Women of finer mould "
36643	36700	36635	36636	the Bishop	4673	" are needed , to be the mothers of the men who , in the years to come , are to make England great . Nay , rather than let one escape , I would shut up all the little foolish birds in a Nunnery , with our excellent Sub - Prioress to administer necessary discipline . "
37175	37281	37164	37165	The Prioress	373	" I did not suppose , Reverend Father , that it was to be of any advantage to the world , that Sister Seraphine should return to it . The advantage was to be to her , and also to this whole Community , well rid of the presence of one who finds our sacred exercises irksome ; our beautiful Nunnery , a prison ; her cell , a living tomb . She cries out for life . ' I want to live , ' she said , ' I am young , I am gay , I am beautiful ! I want life . ' "
37282	37289	37291	37292	the Bishop	4673	" To such as Sister Seraphine , "
37296	37408	37291	37292	the Bishop	4673	" life is but a mirror which reflects themselves . Other forms and faces may flit by , in the background ; dimly seen , scarcely noticed . There is but one face and form occupying the entire foreground . Life is , to such , the mirror which ministers to vanity . Should a husband appear in the picture , he is soon relegated to the background , receiving only occasional glances over the shoulder . If children dance into the field of vision , they are petulantly driven elsewhere . Tell me ? Did Sister Seraphine 's desire for life include any expression of the desire to give life ? "
37423	37426	37427	37427	she	373	" No , "
37433	37438	37440	37441	the Bishop	4673	" I thought not , "
37443	37475	37440	37441	the Bishop	4673	" Self - centred , shallow natures are not capable of the sublime passion for motherhood ; partly , no doubt , because they themselves possess no life worth passing on . "
37552	37555	37556	37556	he	4673	" No , "
37576	37649	37556	37556	he	4673	" the Seraphines have not the instinct of motherhood . And the future greatness of our race depends upon those noble women who are able to pass on to their sons and daughters a life which is true , and brave , and worthy ; a life whose foundation is self - sacrifice , whose cornerstone is loyalty , and from whose summit waves the banner of unsullied love of hearth and home .
37650	37785	37565	37565	his	4673	" A woman with the true instinct of motherhood can not see a little child without yearning to clasp it to her bosom . When she finds her mate , she thinks more of being the mother of his children than the object of his devotion , because the Self in her is subservient to the maternal instinct for self - sacrifice . These women are pure as snow , and they hold their men to the highest and the best . Such women are needed in the world . Our Lady knoweth , I speak not lightly , unadvisedly nor wantonly ; but were Seraphine such an one as this , I should say ; ' Leave the door on the latch . Without permission , yet without reproach let her go . ' "
37786	37798	37800	37801	the Prioress	373	" Were Seraphine such an one as that , my lord , "
37805	37835	37800	37801	the Prioress	373	" then would there be no question of her going . If the cornerstone of character be loyalty , the very essential of loyalty is the keeping of vows . "
37836	37840	37842	37843	the Bishop	4673	" Quite so , "
37845	37878	37842	37843	the Bishop	4673	" undoubtedly , my daughter . Unless , by some strange fatality , those vows were made under a total misapprehension . You tell me Sister Seraphine expected a man to intervene ? "
37947	37961	37962	37962	he	4673	" What if , after all , I can help you in this , "
37965	38009	37962	37962	he	4673	" What if I can throw light upon the whole situation , and find a cause for the little foolish bird 's restless condition , proving to you that she may have heard something more than the mere neighing of a palfrey ! Listen !
38010	38110	38138	38138	she	373	" A Knight arrived in this city , rather more than a month ago ; a very noble Knight , splendid to look upon ; one of our bravest Crusaders . He arrived here in sore anguish of heart . His betrothed had been taken from him during his absence from England , waging war against the Turks in Palestine taken from him by a most dastardly and heartless plot . He made many inquiries concerning this Nunnery and Order , rode north again on urgent business , but returned , with a large retinue , five days since . "
38186	38193	38194	38194	he	1257	" I knew him of old , "
38197	38320	38194	38194	he	1257	" knew him as a high - spirited lad , yet loving , and much beloved . He came to me , in his grief , distraught with anguish of heart , and told me this tale of treachery and wrong . Never did I hear of such a network of evil device , such a tragedy of loving hearts sundered . And when at last he returned to this land , he found that the girl whom he had thought false , thinking him so , had entered a Nunnery . Also he seemed convinced that she was to be found among our White Ladies of Worcester . Now tell me , dear Prioress , think you she could be Seraphine ? "
38344	38353	38354	38354	she	91	" From my knowledge of Sister Mary Seraphine , "
38357	38382	38354	38354	she	91	" it seems unlikely that for loss of her , so noble a Knight as you describe would be distraught with anguish of heart . "
38383	38392	38394	38395	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , there I do not agree , "
38397	38445	38394	38395	the Bishop	4673	" It is ever opposites which attract . The tall we d the short ; the stout , the lean ; the dark , the fair ; the grave , the gay . Wherefore my stern Crusader may be breaking his heart for your foolish little bird . "
38446	38453	38455	38456	the Prioress	373	" I do not think so , "
38465	38512	38455	38456	the Prioress	373	" Not that I would presume to differ from you , Reverend Father . Doubtless you are better versed in such matters than I. But if it be as you suppose what measures do you suggest ? How am I to deal with Sister Mary Seraphine ? "
38629	38671	38622	38623	the Bishop	4673	" Let her fly , my daughter ; let her fly . If his arms await her , she will not have far to go , nor many dangers to face . Her lover will know how to guard his own . "
38672	38676	38678	38679	the Prioress	373	" My lord , "
38686	38800	38678	38679	the Prioress	373	" you amaze me ! Am I to understand that you would have me open the Convent door , so that a renegade nun may escape to her lover ? Or perhaps , my lord , it would better meet your ideas if I bid the porteress stand wide the great gates , so that this high - spirited Knight may ride in and carry off the nun he desires , in sight of all ! My Lord Bishop ! You rule in Worcester and in the cities of the diocese . But I rule in this Nunnery ; and while I rule here , such a thing as this shall never be . "
38824	38834	38835	38835	she	373	" The Knight has bewitched you , my lord , "
38838	38867	38835	38835	she	373	" You forget the rules of our holy Church . You fail in your trust toward the women who look to you as their spiritual Father and guide . "
38913	38918	38919	38919	she	373	" You amaze me ! "
38922	38932	38919	38919	she	373	" Truly , my lord , you amaze me ! "
39063	39067	39068	39068	he	4673	" My daughter , "
39071	39147	39068	39068	he	4673	" I did but agree to that which you yourself suggested . Did you not ask whether it would seem to me right or possible to grant absolution from her vows , tacitly to allow the opening of the cage door , that the little foolish bird might , if she wished it , escape ? Why this exceeding indignation , when I do but yield to your arguments and fall in with your suggestions ? "
39148	39165	39167	39169	the angry Prioress	91	" I did not suggest that a lover 's arms were awaiting one of my nuns , "
39171	39178	39180	39181	the Bishop	4673	" You did not mention arms , "
39185	39389	39180	39181	the Bishop	4673	" but you most explicitly mentioned a voice . ' Supposing the voice of an earthly lover calls , ' you said . And having admitted that I am better versed in such matters than you you must forgive me , dear Prioress , if I amaze you further by acquainting you with the undoubted fact , recognised , in the outer world , as beyond dispute , that when a lover 's voice calls , a lover 's arms are likely to be waiting . Earthly lovers , my daughter , by no means resemble those charming cherubs which you may have observed on the carved woodwork in our Cathedral . Otherwise you might have just a voice , flanked by seraphic wings . Some such fanciful creation must have been in your mind for Sister Mary Seraphine ; for , until I made mention of the noble Knight who had arrived in Worcester distraught with anguish of heart by reason of his loss , you had decided leanings toward tacitly allowing flight . Therefore it was not the fact of the broken vows , but the idea of Seraphine wedded to the brave Crusader , which so greatly roused your ire . "
39499	39507	39508	39508	she	373	" Forgive me , most Reverend Father , "
39511	39519	39508	39508	she	373	" I did wrong to be angry . "
39597	39608	39609	39609	he	4673	" You did right to be angry , my daughter , "
39612	39815	39609	39609	he	4673	" You were not angry with me , nor with the brave Crusader , nor with the foolish Seraphine . Your anger , all unconsciously , was aroused by a system , a method of life which is contrary to Nature , and therefore surely at variance with the will of God . I have long had my doubts concerning these vows of perpetual celibacy for women . For men , it is different . The creative powers in a man , if denied their natural functions , stir him to great enterprise , move him to beget fine phantasies , creations of his brain , children of his intellect . If he stamp not his image on brave sons and fair daughters , he leaves his mark on life in many other ways , both brave and fair . But it is not so with woman ; in the very nature of things it can not be . Methinks these Nunneries would serve a better purpose were they schools from which to send women forth into the world to be good wives and mothers , rather than store - houses filled with sad samples of Nature 's great purposes deliberately unfulfilled . "
39862	39882	39833	39833	he	92	" Such views , my lord , if freely expressed and adopted , would change the entire monastic system . "
39883	39888	39890	39891	the Bishop	4673	" I know it , "
39893	40032	39890	39891	the Bishop	4673	" And I would not express them , saving to you and to one other , to whom I also talk freely . But the older I grow , the more clearly do I see that systems are man - made , and therefore often mistaken , injurious , pernicious . But Nature is Divine . Those who live in close touch with Nature , who rule their lives by Nature 's rules , do not stray far from the Divine plan of the Creator . But when man takes upon himself to say ' Thou shalt , ' or ' Thou shalt not , ' quickly confusion enters . A false premise becomes the starting - point ; and the goal , if it stop short of perdition , is , at best , folly and failure . "
40063	40080	40060	40060	she	373	" To say these things here , my lord , is to say them too late . "
40081	40088	40090	40092	Symon of Worcester	154	" It is never too late , "
40094	40133	40060	40060	she	373	" ' Too late ' tolls the knell of the coward heart . If we find out a mistake while we yet walk the earth where we made it , it is not too late to amend it . "
40134	40153	40060	40060	she	373	" Think you so , Reverend Father ? Then what do you counsel me to do with Seraphine ? "
40154	40499	40060	40060	she	373	" Speak to her gently , and with great care and prudence . Say to her much of that which you have said to me , and a little of that which I have said to you , but expressed in such manner as will be suited to a foolish mind . You and I can hurl bricks at one another , my dear Prioress , and be the better for the exercise . But we must not fling at little Seraphine aught harder than a pillow of down . Empty heads , like empty eggshells , are soon broken . Tell her you have consulted me concerning her desire to return to the world ; and that I , being lenient , and holding somewhat wider views on this subject than the majority of prelates , also being well acquainted with the mind of His Holiness the Pope concerning those who embrace the religious life for reasons other than a true vocation , have promised to arrange the matter of a dispensation . But add that there must be no possibility of any scandal connected with the Nunnery . Since the Lady Wulgeova , mother of Bishop Wulstan , of blessed memory , took the veil here a century and a half ago , this house has ever been above reproach . You will tacitly allow her to slip away ; and , once away , I will set matters right for her . But nothing must transpire which could stumble or scandalise the other members of the Community . The peculiar circumstances which the Knight made known to me always , of course , without making any mention of the name of Seraphine can hardly have occurred in any other case . It is not likely , for instance , that our worthy Sub - Prioress was torn by treachery from the arms of a despairing lover ; and she would undoubtedly share your very limiting ideas of a lover 's physical qualities and requirements ; possibly not even allowing him a voice .
40500	40599	40060	40060	she	373	" Now I happen to know that the Knight daily spends the hour of Vespers in the Cathedral crypt , kneeling before the shrine of Saint Oswald beside a stretcher whereon lies one of his men , much bandaged about the head , swathed in linen , and covered with a cloak . The Knight has my leave to lay the sick man before the holy relics , daily , for five days . I asked of him what he expected would result from so doing . He made answer : ' A great recovery and restoration . ' "
40624	40631	40633	40634	the Bishop	4673	" A great recovery and restoration , "
40639	40680	40612	40612	he	4673	" Well ? The blessed relics can do much . They may avail to mend a broken head . Could they mend a broken heart ? I know not . That were , of the two , the greater miracle . "
40693	40872	40873	40874	The Bishop	4673	" Well , my daughter , matters being as they are , you may inform Sister Mary Seraphine that , should she chance to lose her way among the hundred and forty - two columns , when passing through the crypt after Vespers , she will find a Knight , who will doubtless know what to do next . If he can contrive to take her safely from the Cathedral and out of the Precincts , she will have to ride with him to Warwick , where a priest will be in readiness to we d them . But it would be well that Sister Mary Seraphine should have some practice in mounting and riding , before she goes on so adventurous a journey . She may remember the crimson trappings of her palfrey , and yet have forgotten how to sit him . It is for us to make sure that the Knight 's brave plans for the safe capture of his lady , do not fail for lack of any help which we may lawfully give . "
40885	40896	40897	40897	he	4673	" When did the nuns last have a Play Day ? "
40900	40906	40908	40909	the Prioress	373	" Not a month ago , "
40911	40932	40908	40909	the Prioress	373	" They made the hay in the river meadow , and carried it themselves . They thought it rare sport . "
40940	41041	41068	41069	the Prioress	373	" Give them a Play Day , dear Prioress , in honour of my visit . Tell them I asked that they should have it the day after to - morrow . I will then send you my white palfrey , suitably caparisoned . Brother Philip , who attends me when I ride , and who has the palfrey well controlled , shall lead him in . The nuns can then ride in turns , in the river meadow ; and our little foolish bird can try her wings , before she attempts the long flight from Worcester to Warwick . "
41072	41089	41068	41069	the Prioress	373	" I pray you , give me your blessing , Reverend Father , before you go . "
41130	41166	41097	41097	his	4673	" The Lord bless thee , and keep thee ; and grant unto thee grace and strength to choose and to do the harder part , when the harder part is His will for thee . "
41170	41176	41178	41179	the Bishop	4673	" Benedictio Domini sit vobiscum , "
41732	41735	41737	41739	Symon of Worcester	154	" Benedicite , "
41744	41747	41749	41750	the Chaplain	1334	" Deus , "
41844	41849	41851	41852	the Chaplain	1334	" Holly and Mistletoe , "
41861	41870	41871	41871	he	1334	" Yea , verily ! Mistletoe and Holly , "
41881	41904	41871	41871	he	1334	" The Reverend Father sups with the World , and indulges the Flesh . Methinks the Devil can not be far off . "
42062	42064	42058	42059	The Bishop	4673	" Benedicite "
42215	42240	42209	42209	he	4673	" At length the time has come when we may talk freely ; and truly , my son , we have much to say . "
42264	42269	42271	42272	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , then , "
42274	42375	42271	42272	the Bishop	4673	" No situation can be better for a private conversation than the very centre of a very large room . Have you not heard it said that walls have ears ? Well , in a small room , they may use them to some purpose . But here , we sit so far removed from the walls that , strain their ears as they may , they will hear nothing ; even the very key - hole , opening wide its naughty eye , will see naught , neither will the adjacent ear hear anything . We may speak freely . "
42488	42573	42484	42484	he	4673	" The kind used at the marriage feast at Cana in Galilee , when the supply of an inferior quality had failed . This , my friends , is pure water , wholesome , refreshing , and not costly . I drink it from glass which gives to it the colour of the juice of the grape , partly in order that my guests may not feel chilled in their own enjoyment of more gay and luscious beverage ; partly because I enjoy the emblem .
42574	42698	42484	42484	he	4673	" The gifts of circumstance , life , and nature , vary , not so much in themselves , as in the human vessels which contain them . If the heart be a ruby goblet , the humblest form of pure love filling it , will assume the rich tint and fervour of romance . If the mind be , in itself , a thing of vivid tints and glowing colours , the dullest thought within it will take on a lustre , a sparkle , a glow of brilliancy . Thus , whensoever men or matters seem to me dull or wearisome , to myself I say : ' Symon ! Thou art this day , thyself , a pewter pot . ' "
42714	42721	42722	42722	he	4673	" Aye , the best wine ! "
42726	42789	42722	42722	he	4673	" ' Thou hast kept the best wine until now . ' The water of earth drawn by faithful servants , acting in unquestioning obedience to the commands of the blessed Mother of our Lord transmuted by the word and power of the Divine Son ; outpoured for others , in loving service ; this is ever ' the best wine . ' "
42884	42902	42880	42881	Hugh d'Argent	132	" I have been through deep waters , Reverend Father , since last I supped with you . "
42910	43037	42903	42904	The Bishop	4673	" So I supposed , my son . Now tell me what you will , neither more nor less . I will then give you what counsel I can . On the one point concerning which you must not tell me more than I may rightly know , I will question you . Have you contrived to see the woman you loved , and lost , and are now seeking to regain ? Tell me not how , nor when , nor where ; but have you had speech with her ? Have you made clear to her the treachery which sundered you ? Have you pleaded with her to remember her early betrothal , to renounce these later vows , and to fly with you ? "
43169	43176	43177	43177	he	764	" My lord , I have , "
43180	43203	43177	43177	he	764	" All those things have I done . I have been in heaven , Reverend Father , and I have been in hell "
43204	43210	43212	43213	the Bishop	4673	" Sh , my son , "
43215	43371	43212	43213	the Bishop	4673	" Methinks you have been in a place which is neither heaven nor hell ; though it may , on occasion , approximate somewhat nearly to both . How you got there , is a marvel to me ; and how you escaped , without creating a scandal , an even greater wonder . Yet I think it wise , for the present , not to know too much . I merely required to be certain that you had actually found your lost betrothed , made her aware of your proximity , your discovery , and your desires . I gathered that you had succeeded in so doing ; for , two days ago , the Prioress herself sent to beg a private interview with me , in order to ask whether , under certain circumstances , I could approve the return of a nun to the world , and obtain absolution from her vows . "
43441	43581	43438	43438	he	4673	" The Prioress a most wise and noble lady , of whom I told you on the day when you first questioned me concerning the Nunnery has been having trouble with a nun , by name Sister Mary Seraphine . This young and lovely lady has , just lately , heard the world loudly calling on her own shewing , through the neighing of a palfrey bringing to mind past scenes of gaiety . But the Prioress suspicioned the voice of an earthly lover ; and I , knowing how reckless and resolute an earthly lover was attempting to invade the Nunnery , we both the Prioress and I drew our own conclusions , and proceeded to face the problem with which we found ourselves confronted , namely : whether to allow or to thwart the flight of Seraphine . "
43673	43679	43667	43667	his	4673	" So much for Seraphine ! "
43680	43690	43692	43693	the Knight	764	" I know not any lady of that name , "
43695	43864	43667	43667	his	4673	" Not by that name , my son . The nuns are not known in the Convent by the names they bore before they left the world . I happen to know that the Prioress , before she professed , was Mora , Countess of Norelle . I know this because , years ago , I saw her at the Court , when she was a maid of honour to the Queen ; very young and lovely ; yet , even then remarkable for wisdom , piety , and a certain sweet dignity of deportment . Sometimes now , when she receives me in the severe habit of her Order , I find myself remembering the flow of beautiful hair , soft as spun silk , bound by a circlet of gold round the regal head ; the velvet and ermine ; the jewels at her breast . Yet do I chide myself for recalling things which these holy women have renounced , and doubtless would fain forget . "
43895	43903	43905	43906	the Bishop	4673	" Kindle a fire on the hearth , "
43913	43943	43905	43906	the Bishop	4673	" The evening air strikes chilly . Also I greatly love the smell of burning wood . It is pungent to the nostrils , and refreshing to the brain . "
44167	44172	44173	44173	he	154	" This is refreshing , "
44176	44238	44173	44173	he	154	" This soothes and yet braces the mind . And now , my son , let us return to the question of your own private concerns . First , let me ask Hugh , dear lad , as friend and counsellor I ask it are you able now to tell me the name of the woman you desire to we d ? "
44239	44246	44248	44249	the Knight	764	" Nay , my dear lord , "
44251	44388	44248	44249	the Knight	764	" that I can not do . I guard her name , as I would guard mine honour . If as may our Lady be pleased to grant she consent to fly with me , her name will still be mine to guard ; yet then all men may know it , so they speak it with due respect and reverence . But if as may our blessed Lady forbid she withhold herself from me , so that three days hence I ride away alone ; then must I ride away leaving no shadow of reproach on her fair fame . Her name will be forever in my heart ; but no word of mine shall have left it , in the mind of any man , linked with broken vows , or a forsaken lover . "
44399	44407	44408	44408	he	4673	" That being so , my son , "
44413	44445	44408	44408	he	4673	" for want of any better name , I needs must call her by the name she bears in the Nunnery , and now speak with you of Sister Mary Seraphine . "
44450	44460	44461	44461	he	132	" I care not to hear of this Seraphine , "
44464	44482	44484	44485	the Bishop	4673	" Yet I fear me you must summon patience to hear of Seraphine for a few moments , "
44586	44586	44576	44576	she	427	"
44799	44874	44875	44876	The Bishop	4673	" The Prioress relates to me first of all a conversation she had , by my suggestion , with Sister Mary Serephine , in which she told that lady much of what passed between herself and me when she consulted me upon the apparent desire of this nun to escape from the Convent , renounce her vows , and return to her lover and the world her lover who had come to save her . "
44933	44941	44942	44942	he	4673	" A most piteous scene took place , "
44945	45033	44942	44942	he	4673	" on the day when Sister Seraphine first heard again the call of the outer world . Most moving it was , as told me by the Prioress . The distraught nun lay upon the floor of her cell in an abandonment of frantic weeping . She imitated the galloping of a horse with her hands and feet , a ride of some sort evidently being in her mind . At length she lifted a swollen countenance , crying that her lover had come to save her . "
45163	45167	45168	45168	he	4673	" The Prioress , "
45171	45271	45273	45274	the Bishop	4673	" with her usual instinctive sense of the helpfulness of outward surroundings , and desiring , with a fine justice , to give Seraphine and her lover every possible advantage , arranged that the conversation should take place in the Nunnery garden , in a secluded spot where they could not be overheard , yet where the sunshine glinted , through overhanging branches , flecking , in golden patches , the soft turf ; where birds carolled , and spread swift wings ; where white clouds chased one another across the blue sky ; in fact , my son , "
45280	45291	45273	45274	the Bishop	4673	" where all Nature sang aloud of liberty and nonrestraint . "
45497	45506	45508	45509	the Bishop	4673	" Which was generous in the Reverend Mother , "
45570	45570	45553	45553	she	1441	"
45591	45685	45553	45553	she	1441	" However she appears faithfully to have laid before Sister Mary Seraphine , my view of the matter , giving her to understand that I am inclined to be lenient concerning vows made under misapprehension ; also that , when there is not a true vocation , and a worldly spirit chafes against the cloistered life , I regard its presence within the Community as more likely to be harmful to the common weal , than the short - lived scandal which might arise if those in power should connive at an escape . "
45694	45702	45703	45703	he	764	" Could we arrive , my lord , "
45706	45719	45703	45703	he	764	" at the Lady Prioress 's message , of which you spoke ? "
45720	45729	45731	45732	the Bishop	4673	" We are tending thither , my son , "
45736	45787	45731	45732	the Bishop	4673	" Curb your impatience . We of the Cloister are wo nt to move slowly , with measured tread each step a careful following up of the step which went before not with the leaps and bounds and capers of the laity . In due time we shall reach the message .
45788	45911	45686	45687	The Knight	764	" Well , in this conversation the Prioress appears to have complied with my suggestions , excepting in the matter of one most important detail , concerning which she used her own discretion . I distinctly advised her to tell Seraphine that we were aware of your arrival , and that to my certain knowledge you were in the crypt each afternoon at the hour when the White Ladies pass to and from Vespers . In fact , my dear Knight , I even went so far as to suggest to the Reverend Mother to give Sister Mary Seraphine to understand that if she stepped aside , losing her way among the many pillars , you would probably know what to do next .
45912	45918	45731	45732	the Bishop	4673	" But the Reverend Mother writes "
45927	45996	45921	45922	the Bishop	4673	" ' I felt so sure from your description of the noble Knight who came to you in his trouble , that he can not be the lover of this shallow - hearted little Seraphine , that I deemed it wise not to tell her of his arrival , nor to mention your idea , that the woman he seeks is to be found in this Nunnery . ' "
46018	46026	46028	46029	the Bishop	4673	" Now that is like the Prioress , "
46031	46147	46028	46029	the Bishop	4673	" thus to use her own judgment , setting at naught my superior knowledge of the facts , and flouting my authority ! A noble nature , Hugh , and most lovable ; yet an imperious will , and a strength of character and purpose unusual in a woman . Had she remained in the world and married , her husband would have found it somewhat difficult wholly to mould her to his will . Yet to possess such a woman would have been worth adventuring much . But I must not fret you , dear lad , by talking of the Prioress , when your mind is intent upon arriving at the decision of Seraphine .
46148	46357	46358	46359	The Bishop	4673	" Well , I fear me , I have but sorry news for you . The Reverend Mother writes : ' Sister Mary Seraphine expressed herself as completely satisfied with the cloistered life . She declared that her desire to return to the world had been but a passing phase , of which she was completely purged by the timely discipline of Mother Sub - Prioress , and by the fact that she has been appointed , with Sister Mary Gabriel , to embroider the new altar - cloth for the Chapel . She talked more eagerly about a stitch she is learning from Mary Gabriel , than about any of those by - gone memories , which certainly had seemed most poignantly revived in her ; and I had no small difficulty in turning her mind from the all - absorbing question as to how to obtain the right tint for the pomegranates . My lord , to a mind thus intent upon needle - work for the Altar of God , I could scarce have brought myself to mention the call of an earthly lover , even had I believed your Knight to be seeking Seraphine . Her heart is now wedded to the Cloister . ' "
46363	46393	46358	46359	The Bishop	4673	" Therefore , my son , we must conclude that your secret interview , whenever or wherever it took place , had no effect will bear no lasting fruit . "
46436	46440	46441	46441	he	132	" The message , "
46450	46455	46456	46456	he	4673	" ' But , ' "
46459	46585	46456	46456	he	4673	" ' if you still believe your noble Knight to be the lover of Seraphine , then I pray you to tell him this from me . No nun worthy of a brave man 's love , would consent to break her vows . A nun who could renounce her vows to go to him , would wrong herself and him , bringing no blessing to his home . Better an empty hearth , than a hearth where broods a curse . I ask you , my lord , to give this as a message to that noble Knight from me the Prioress of this House and to bid him go in peace , praying for a heart submissive to the will of God . ' "
46892	46895	46902	46902	his	132	" Why ? "
46905	46910	46902	46902	his	132	" Ah , why ! "
47021	47027	47029	47030	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , dear lad , "
47032	47079	47029	47030	the Bishop	4673	" I may not give it you , because it mentions the White Ladies by name , the Order , and poor little shallow , changeful Seraphine herself , But this much I will do : as you may not have it , none other shall . "
47128	47142	47029	47030	the Bishop	4673	" Better an empty hearth ; than a hearth where broods a curse . "
47192	47199	47200	47200	he	764	" I would risk the curse , "
47206	47218	47200	47200	he	764	" By Pilate 's water , I would risk the curse ! "
47219	47228	47230	47231	the Bishop	4673	" I know you would , my son , "
47233	47412	47230	47231	the Bishop	4673	" and , by our Lady 's crown , I would have let you risk it , believing , as I do , that it would end in blessing . But listen , Hugh . In asking what you asked , you scarce know what you did . You need not say ' yea , ' nor ' nay , ' but I incline to think with the Reverend Mother , that the woman you sought was not foolish little Seraphine , turned one way by the neighing of a palfrey , another by the embroidering of a pomegranate . There are women of finer mould in that Nunnery , any one of whom may be your lost betrothed . But of this we may be sure : whosoever she be , the Prioress knows her , and knew of whom she wrote when she sent you that message . She has the entire confidence of all in the Nunnery . I verily believe she knows them better than does their confessor a saintly old man , but dim .
47413	47727	47887	47887	His	764	" Now , listen to me . I said you knew not what you asked . Hugh , my lad , if you had won your betrothed away , you would have had much to learn and much to unlearn . Believe me , I know women , as only a priest of many years ' standing can know them . Women are either bad or good . The bad are bad below man 's understanding , because their badness is not leavened by one grain of honour ; a fact the worst of men will ever fail to grasp . The good are good above man 's comprehension , because their perfect purity of heart causeth the spirit ever to triumph over the flesh ; and their love - instinct is the instinct of self - sacrifice . Every true woman is a Madonna in the home , or fain would be , if her man would let her . To such a woman , each promise of a child is an Annunciation ; our Lady 's awe and wonder , whisper again in the temple of her inner being ; for her love has deified the man she loves ; and , it seems to her , a child of his and hers must be a holy babe , born into the world to help redeem it . And so it would be , could she but have her way . But too often the man fails to understand , and so spoils the perfect plan . And she to whom love means self - sacrifice , sacrifices all even her noblest ideals sooner than fail a call upon her love . Yet I say again , could the Madonna instinct have had full sway , the world would have been redeemed ere now to holiness , to happiness , to health .
47728	47841	47887	47887	His	764	" You looked high , my son , by your own shewing . You loved high . Your love was worthy , for you remained faithful , when you believed you had been betrayed . Let your consolation now be the knowledge that she also was faithful , and that it is a double faithfulness which keeps her from responding to the call of your love . Seek union with her on the spiritual plane , and some day in the Realm where all noble things shall attain unto full perfection you may yet give thanks that your love was not allowed to pass through the perilous pitfalls of an earthly union . "
47911	47918	47919	47919	he	4673	" I want not spiritual planes , "
47922	47970	47919	47919	he	4673	" nor realms of perfection . I want my own wife , in my own home ; and , could I have won her there , I have not much doubt but that I could have lifted her over any perilous pitfalls that came in her way . "
47971	47977	47979	47980	the Bishop	4673	" True , my son , "
48020	48058	48014	48014	his	154	" Your great strength would be fully equal to lifting ladies over pitfalls . Which recalls to my mind a scene in this day 's events , which I would fain describe to you before we part . "
48118	48281	48099	48099	he	4673	" When the Prioress and myself were discussing your hopes , my son , and I was urging , in your interests , liberty of flight for Sister Mary Seraphine , I informed the Reverend Mother that the carrying out of your plans , carefully laid in order to keep any scandal concerning the White Ladies from reaching the city , would involve for Seraphine a ride of many hours to Warwick , almost immediately upon safely reaching the Star hostel . This seemed as nothing to the lover who , by his own shewing , had ofttimes seen her ' ride like a bird , all day , on the moors . ' But to us who know the effect of monastic life and how quickly such matters as these become lost arts through disuse , this romantic ride in the late afternoon and on into the summer night , loomed large as a possible obstacle to the successful flight of Seraphine .
48282	48374	48376	48377	the Bishop	4673	" Therefore , in order that our little bird might try her wings , regain her seat and mastery of a horse , and rid herself of a first painful stiffness , I persuaded the Reverend Mother to grant the nuns a Play Day , in honour of my visit , promising to send them my white palfrey , suitably caparisoned , in safe charge of a good lay - brother , so that all nuns who pleased , might ride in the river meadow . You would not think it , "
48383	48449	48376	48377	the Bishop	4673	" but the White Ladies dearly love such sport , when it is lawful . They have an aged ass which they gleefully mount in turns , on Play Days , in the courtyard and in the meadow . Therefore riding is not altogether strange to them , although my palfrey , Iconoklastes , is somewhat of an advance upon their mild ass , Sheba . "
48463	48469	48470	48470	he	764	" Wherefore ' Iconoklastes ' ? "
48487	48490	48492	48493	the Bishop	4673	" Because , "
48536	48536	48531	48531	I	0	"
48537	48540	48542	48543	the Knight	764	" Brute , "
48553	48572	48542	48543	the Knight	764	" Methinks I should have named him ' Devil , ' for the doing of such diabolic mischief . "
48573	48576	48578	48579	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
48583	48600	48578	48579	the Bishop	4673	" The Devil would have spared my flower beds . They were a snare unto me . "
48601	48608	48610	48611	the Knight	764	" And wherefore ' Sheba ' ? "
48613	48627	48629	48630	the Bishop	4673	" I named her so , when I gave her to the Prioress , "
48632	48696	48629	48630	the Bishop	4673	" in reply to a question put to me by the Reverend Mother . The ass was elderly and mild , even then , but a handsome creature , of good breed . The Prioress asked me whether she still had too much spirit to be easily managed by the lay - sisters . I answered that her name was ' Sheba . ' "
48723	48730	48731	48731	he	764	" Did that content the Prioress ? "
48743	48746	48748	48749	the Bishop	4673	" Perfectly , "
48751	48782	48748	48749	the Bishop	4673	" She smiled and said : ' That is well . ' And the name stuck to the ass , though the Reverend Mother and I alone understood its meaning . "
48783	48789	48791	48792	the Knight	764	" About the Play Day ? "
48797	48979	48980	48981	The Bishop	92	" Ah , yes ! About the Play Day . The time chosen was after noon on this day , in order that the Prioress might first accomplish her talk with Seraphine , thus clearing the way for our experiment . Although written last evening , I had not received the Reverend Mother 's decisive letter , when Iconoklastes set forth ; and , I confess , I looked forward with keen interest , to questioning the lay - brother on his return . As I have told you , I had doubts concerning Seraphine ; but I knew the Prioress would see to it that my meaning and intention reached the member of the Community actually concerned , were she Seraphine or another ; and I should have light , both on the identity of the lady and on her probable course of action , when report reached me as to which of the nuns had taken the riding seriously . Therefore , with no little interest , I awaited the return of Iconoklastes , in charge of Brother Philip . "
49005	49008	49010	49011	the Knight	764	" Well ? "
49021	49030	49010	49011	the Knight	764	" Well , my lord ? And then ? "
49042	49056	49057	49057	Philip	160	" I paused , my son , that you might say : ' Wherefore "
49058	49061	49031	49032	The Bishop	4673	" ? ' "
49062	49071	49073	49074	the Knight	764	" The names of men interest me not , "
49079	49093	49073	49074	the Knight	764	" I care but to know the reason for the names of beasts . "
49094	49098	49100	49101	the Bishop	4673	" Quite right , "
49103	49124	49100	49101	the Bishop	4673	" Adam named the beasts ; Eve named the men . Yet , I would like you to ask ' Wherefore "
49127	49150	49100	49101	the Bishop	4673	" ' because the Prioress at once put that question , when she heard me call Brother Mark by his new name . "
49151	49157	49159	49164	the Knight , with averted eyes	1517	" Wherefore ' Philip ' ? "
49166	49199	49100	49101	the Bishop	4673	" Because ' Philip ' signifies ' a lover of horses . ' I named the good brother so , when he developed a great affection for all the steeds in my stables .
49200	49232	49100	49101	the Bishop	4673	" Well , at length Brother Philip returned , leading the palfrey . I had been riding upon the heights above the town , on my comely black mare , Shulamite . "
49264	49304	49260	49260	he	764	" Riding into the courtyard , just as Philip led in the palfrey , I bade him first to see to Icon 's comfort ; then come to my chamber and report . Before long the lay - brother appeared .
49305	49432	49260	49260	he	764	" Now Brother Philip is an excellent teller of stories . He does not need to mar them by additions , because his quickness of observation takes in every detail , and his excellent memory lets nothing slip . He has a faculty for recalling past scenes in pictures , and tells a story as if describing a thing just happening before his mental vision : the sole draw - back to so vivid a memory being , that if the picture grows too mirth provoking , Brother Philip is seized with spasms of the diaphragm , and further description becomes impossible . On this occasion , I saw at once that the good brother 's inner vision teemed with pictures . I settled myself to listen .
49433	49465	49260	49260	he	764	" Aye , it had been a wonderful scene , and more merriment , so the lay - sisters afterwards told Brother Philip , than ever known before at any Play Day .
49466	49481	49260	49260	he	764	" Icon was led in state from the courtyard , down into the river meadow .
49482	49525	49260	49260	he	764	" At first the great delight was to crowd round him , pat him , stroke his mane , finger his trappings ; cry out words of ecstatic praise and admiration , and attempt to feed him with all manner of unsuitable food .
49526	49626	49260	49260	he	764	" Icon , I gather , behaved much as most males behave on finding themselves the centre of a crowd of admiring women . He pawed the ground , and swished his tail ; arched his neck , and looked from side to side ; munched cakes he did not want , winking a large and roguish eye at Brother Philip ; and finally , ignoring all the rest , fixed a languorous gaze upon the Prioress , she being the only lady present who stood apart , regarding the scene , but taking no share in the general adulation .
49627	49720	49260	49260	he	764	" At length the riding began ; Brother Philip keeping firm hold on Icon , while the entire party of nuns undertook to mount the nun who had elected to ride . Each time Brother Philip attempted a description of this part of the proceedings he was at once seized with such spasms in the region of his girdle , that speech became an impossibility ; he could but hold himself helplessly , looking at me from out streaming eyes , until a fresh peep at his mental picture again bent him double .
49721	49756	49260	49260	he	764	" Much as I prefer a story complete , from start to finish , I was constrained to command Brother Philip to pass on to scenes which would allow him some possibility of articulate speech .
49757	49791	49260	49260	he	764	" The sternness of my tones gave to the good brother the necessary assistance . In a voice still weak and faltering , but gaining firmness as it proceeded , he described the riding .
49792	49899	49260	49260	he	764	" Most of the nuns rode but a few yards , held in place by so many willing hands that , from a distance , only the noble head of Icon could be seen above the moving crowd , surmounted by the terrified face of the riding nun ; who , hastening to exclaim that her own delight must not cause her to keep others from participation , would promptly fall off into the waiting arms held out to catch her ; at once becoming , when safely on her feet , the boldest encourager of the next aspirant to a seat upon the back of Icon .
49900	49943	49260	49260	he	764	" Sister Mary Seraphine proved a disappointment . She had been wo nt to boast so much of her own palfrey , her riding , and her hunting , that the other nuns had counted upon seeing her gallop gaily over the field .
49944	49985	49260	49260	he	764	" The humble and short - lived attempts were all made first . Then Sister Mary Seraphine , bidding the others stand aside , was swung by one tall sister , acting according to her instructions , neatly into the saddle .
49986	49999	49260	49260	he	764	" She gathered up the reins , as to the manner born , "
50038	50065	50066	50066	He	160	" Whereupon , Sister Mary Seraphine , almost unseated , shrieked to Brother Philip to hold the bridle , rating him soundly for having let go . "
50169	50228	50496	50496	He	4673	" At this , Mother Sub - Prioress , long weary of promenading , yet determined not to be left behind while others followed on , exclaimed that if the eye of the creature were vicious , then must Sister Mary Seraphine straightway dismount , and the brute be led back to the seat where the Prioress sat watching .
50229	50248	50496	50496	He	4673	" To this Seraphine gladly agreed , and a greatly sobered procession returned to the top of the field .
50249	50278	50496	50496	He	4673	" But gaiety was quickly restored by the old lay - sister , Mary Antony , who , armed with the Reverend Mother 's permission , insisted on mounting .
50279	50317	50496	50496	He	4673	" Willing hands , miscalculating the exceeding lightness of her aged body , lifted her higher than need be , above the back of the palfrey . Whereupon Mary Antony , parting her feet , came down straddling !
50318	50384	50496	50496	He	4673	" Firm as a limpet , she sat thus upon Icon . No efforts of the nuns could induce her to shift her position . Commanding Brother Philip , seeing ' the Lord Bishop ' was now safely mounted , to lead on and not keep him standing , old Antony rode off in triumph , blessing the nuns right and left , as she passed .
50385	50416	50496	50496	He	4673	" Never were heard such shrieks of merriment ! Even Mother Sub - Prioress sank upon a seat to laugh with less fatigue . Sister Seraphine 's fretful complaints were forgotten .
50417	50457	50496	50496	He	4673	" Twice round the field went old Antony , with fingers uplifted . Icon stepped carefully , arching his neck and walking as if he well knew that he bore on his back , ninety odd years of brave gaiety .
50458	50480	50496	50496	He	4673	" Well , that made of the Play Day a success . But the best of all was yet to come . "
50562	50608	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" They had lifted Mary Antony down , and were crowding round Icon , patting and praising him , when a message came from the Reverend Mother , bidding Brother Philip to bring the palfrey into the courtyard ; the nuns to remain in the field .
50609	50637	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" They watched the beautiful creature pace through the archway and disappear , and none knew quite what would happen next . Philip heard them discussing it later .
50638	50693	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" Some thought the Bishop had sent for his palfrey . Others , that the Reverend Mother had feared for the safety of the old lay - sister ; or , lest her brave example should fire the rest to be too venturesome . Yet all eyes were turned toward the archway , vaguely expectant .
50694	50696	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" And then
50697	50711	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" They heard the hoofs of Icon ring on the flagstones of the courtyard .
50712	50729	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" They heard the calm voice of the Prioress . Could it be she who was coming ?
50730	50772	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" Out from the archway , into the sunshine , alone and fearless ; the Prioress rode upon Icon . On her face was the light of a purposeful radiance . The palfrey stepped as if proud of the burden he carried .
50773	50859	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" She smiled and would have cried out gaily to the groups as she passed . But , with one accord , the nuns dropped to their knees , with clasped hands , and faces uplifted , adoring . Always they loved her , revered her , and thought her beautiful . But this vision of the Prioress , whom none had ever seen mounted , riding forth into the sunshine on the snow - white palfrey , filled their hearts with praise and with wonder .
50860	50919	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" Brother Philip leaned against the archway , watching . He knew his hand upon the bridle was no longer needed , from the moment when he saw the Reverend Mother gather up the reins in her left hand , lay her right gently on the neck of Icon , and , bending , speak low in his ear .
50920	50938	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" She sat a horse said Philip as only they can sit , who have ridden from childhood .
50939	50960	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" She walked him round the meadow once , then gently shook the reins , and he broke into a trot .
50961	50979	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" The watching nuns , now on their feet again , shrieked aloud , with fright and glee .
50980	50999	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" At the extreme end of the meadow , wheeling sharply , she let him out into a canter .
51000	51035	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" The nuns at this were petrified into dumbness . One and all held their breath ; while Mother Sub - Prioress nobody quite knew why turned upon Sister Mary Seraphine , and shook her .
51036	51076	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" And the next moment the Prioress was among them , walking the palfrey slowly , settling her veil , which had streamed behind her as she cantered , bending to speak to one and another , as she passed .
51077	51098	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" And the light of new life was in her eyes . Her cheeks glowed , she seemed a girl again .
51099	51113	50538	50539	The Bishop	4673	" Reining in Iconoklastes , she paused beside Mother Sub - Prioress and said "
51132	51180	51120	51120	he	4673	" She paused and said : ' None need remain here longer than they will . But , being up and mounted , and our Lord Bishop in no haste for the return of his palfrey , it is my intention to ride for an hour . ' "
51192	51201	51202	51202	he	154	" And the Prioress rode for an hour , "
51205	51230	51202	51202	he	154	" For a full hour , in the sunshine , on the soft turf of the river meadow , THE PRIORESS TRIED HER WINGS . "
51300	51308	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" So you know , my lord , "
51313	51322	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" Yes , my son ; I know . "
51323	51328	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" Since this morning ? "
51329	51396	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" Nay , then ! Since the first day you arrived with your story ; asking such careful questions , carelessly . But be not wroth with yourself , Hugh . Faithful to the hilt , have you been . Only no true lover was ever a diplomat ! Matters which mean more than life , can not be dissembled by true hearts from keen eyes . "
51397	51406	51408	51409	the Knight	764	" Then why all the talk concerning Seraphine ? "
51411	51481	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" Seraphine , my son , has served a useful purpose in various conversations . Never before , in the whole of her little shallow , selfish life has Seraphine been so disinterestedly helpful . That you sat here just now , thinking me witless beyond belief , just when I most desired not to appear to know too much , I owe to the swollen countenance of Seraphine . "
51482	51486	51488	51489	the Knight	764	" My lord , "
51495	51502	51488	51489	the Knight	764	" My lord ! How knew you "
51503	51602	51310	51310	Hugh	132	" Peace , lad ! Fash not thyself over it . Is it not a part of my sacred office to follow in the footsteps of my Master and to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart ? Also , respecting , yea , approving your reasons for reticence , I would have let you depart not suspecting my knowledge of that which you wished to conceal , were it not that we must now face this fact together : Since penning that message of apparent finality , the Prioress has tried her wings . "
51615	51619	51620	51620	he	764	" Reverend Father ! "
51623	51632	51620	51620	he	764	" think you that means hope for me ? "
51659	51667	51668	51668	he	154	" I think it means just this , "
51671	51789	51668	51668	he	154	" A conflict , in her , between the mental and the physical ; between reason and instinct ; thought and feeling . The calm , collected mind sent you that reasoned message of final refusal . The sentient body , vibrant with bounding life , instinctively prepares itself for the possibility of the ride with you to Warwick . This gives equal balance to the scale . But a third factor will be called in , finally to decide the matter . By that she will abide ; and neither you nor I , neither earth nor hell , neither things past , things present , nor things to come , could avail to move her . "
51790	51796	51798	51799	the Knight	764	" And that third factor ? "
51801	51806	51808	51809	the Bishop	4673	" Is the Spiritual , "
51817	51864	51865	51865	You	1535	" With that , there came over the Knight a sudden sense of compunction . He began for the first time to see the matter as it must appear to the Bishop and the nun . His own obstinate and determined self - seeking shamed him . "
51876	51881	51865	51865	You	1535	" he said humbly . "
51901	51901	51893	51893	you	1535	"
51921	51934	51905	51905	his	4673	" Angry , my son ? And wherefore should I be angry ? "
51935	51957	51958	51959	The Bishop	4673	" That I should have sought , and should still be seeking , to tempt the Prioress to wrong - doing . "
51976	51981	51982	51982	he	4673	" You tempt her ? "
51985	52145	51982	51982	he	4673	" Tempt her to wrong - doing ! The man lives not , who could succeed in that ! She will not come to you unless she knows it to be right to come , and believes it to be wrong to stay . If I thought you were tempting her , think you I would stand aside and watch the conflict ? Nay ! But I stand aside and wait while she of purer , clearer vision , and walking nearer Heaven than you or I discerns the right , and , choosing it , rejects the wrong . Should she be satisfied that life with you is indeed God 's will for her and I tell you honestly , it will take a miracle to bring this about she will come to you . But she will not come to you unless , in so doing , she is choosing what to her is the harder part . "
52146	52151	52153	52154	the Knight	764	" The harder part ! "
52156	52167	52153	52154	the Knight	764	" You forget , my lord , she loves me . "
52168	52173	52175	52176	the Bishop	4673	" Do I forget ? "
52178	52383	52385	52386	the Prelate	1326	" Have you found me given to forgetting ? The very fact that she loves you , is the heaviest factor against you just now . To such women there comes ever the instinctive feeling , that that which would be sweet must be wrong , and the hard path of renunciation the only right one . They climb not Zion 's mount to reach the crown . They turn and wend their way through Gethsemane to Calvary , sure that thus alone can they at last inherit . And what can we say ? Are they not following in the footsteps of the Son of God ? I fear my nature turns another way . I incline to follow King David , or Solomon in all his glory , chanting glad Songs of Ascent , from the Palace on Mount Zion to the Temple on Mount Moriah . All things harmonious , in sound , form , or colour , seem to me good and , therefore , right . But long years in Italy have soaked me in the worship of the beautiful , inextricably intermingled with the adoration of the Divine . I mistrust mine own judgment , and I fear me "
52397	52444	52385	52386	the Prelate	1326	" I greatly fear me , I am far from being Christlike . But I recognise the spirit of self - crucifixion , when I see it . And the warning that I give you , is not because I forget , but because I remember . "
52499	52507	52509	52510	Hugh d'Argent	132	" It must be close on midnight , "
52512	52520	52509	52510	Hugh d'Argent	132	" a strange hour for an arrival . "
52574	52581	52582	52582	he	764	" A horseman has ridden in , "
52585	52629	52582	52582	he	764	" and ridden fast . His steed is flecked with foam , and stands with spreading nostrils , panting . . . . The rider has passed within . . . . Your men , my lord , are leading away the steed . "
52637	52654	52630	52631	The Knight	764	" Brave beast ! Methinks they would do well to mix his warm mash with ale . "
52713	52716	52718	52719	the Bishop	4673	" Well ? "
52727	52743	52686	52686	They	1550	" My lord , your messenger has returned , and requests an audience without delay . "
52744	52749	52751	52752	the Bishop	4673	" Bid him enter , "
52868	52874	52875	52875	he	1556	" I bring from Rome , "
52884	52900	52878	52878	his	1556	" for my Lord Bishop of Worcester , a letter from His Holiness the Pope . "
53063	53073	53074	53074	he	4673	" How has it fared with you , Roger ? "
53079	53088	53090	53091	the youth	916	" Am I in time , Reverend Father ? "
53095	53200	53090	53091	the youth	916	" I acted on your orders . No expense was spared . I chartered the best vessel I could find , and had set sail within an hour of galloping into the port . We made a good passage , and being fortunate in securing relays of horses along the route , I was in Rome twenty - four hours sooner than we had reckoned . I rode in at sunset ; and , your name and seal passing me on everywhere , your letter , my lord , was in the Holy Father 's hands ere the glow had faded from the distant hills .
53201	53260	53783	53784	The Bishop	4673	" I was right royally entertained by Cardinal Ferrari ; and , truth to tell , a soft couch and silken quilts were welcome , after many nights of rough lodging , in the wayside inns of Normandy and Italy . Moreover , having galloped ahead of time , I felt free to take a long night 's repose .
53261	53337	53090	53091	the youth	916	" But next morning , soon after the pigeons began to coo and circle , I was called and bid to hasten . Then , while I broke my fast with many strange and tasty dishes , seated in a marble court , with fountains playing and vines o'erhanging , the Cardinal returned , he having been summoned already to the bedchamber of the Pope , where the reply of His Holiness lay , ready sealed .
53338	53377	53783	53784	The Bishop	4673	" Whereupon , my lord , I lost no time in setting forth , picking up on my return journey each mount there where I had left it , until I galloped into the port where our vessel waited .
53378	53782	53090	53091	the youth	916	" Then , alas , came delay , and glad indeed was I , that I had not been tempted to linger in Rome ; for the winds were contrary ; some days passed before we could set sail ; and when at last I prevailed upon the mariners to venture , a great storm caught us in mid - channel , threatening to rend the sails to ribbons and , lifting us high , hurl us all to perdition . Helpless and desperate , for the sailors had lost all control , I vowed that if the storm might abate and we come safe to harbour I would when I succeed to my father 's lands in Gloucestershire give to the worthy Abbot of an Abbey adjoining our estate , a meadow , concerning which he and his monks have long broken the tenth commandment and other commands as well , a trout stream running through it , and the dearest delight of the Abbot being fat trout for supper ; and of the monks , to lie on their bellies tickling the trout as they hide in the cool holes under the banks of the stream . But when my father finds the monks thus poaching , he comes up behind them , and up they get quickly or try to ! So , in mid - channel , remembering my sins , I remembered running to tell my father that if he came quickly he would find the good Brothers flat on their bellies , sleeves rolled back , heads hanging over the water , toes well tucked into the turf , deeply intent upon tickling . Then I would run by a short cut , hide in the hazels , and watch while my father stalked up through the meadow , caught and belaboured the poachers . My derisive young laughter seemed now to howl and shriek through the rigging . So I vowed that if the storm abated and we came safe to port , the monks should be given that meadow . Upon which the storm did abate , and to port we came and what my father will say , I know not ! Fearing vexation to you , my lord , from this untoward delay , on landing I rode as fast as mine own good horse could carry me . Am I in time ? "
53851	53857	53859	53860	the Bishop	4673	" Yes , my son , "
53862	53931	53859	53860	the Bishop	4673	" You have returned , not merely in time , but with two days to spare . Was there ever fleeter messenger ! Indeed my choice was well made and my trust well placed . Now you must sup and then take a much - needed rest , dear lad ; and to - morrow tell me if you had need to spend more than I gave you . "
53970	54046	53953	53954	The Bishop	4673	" And let the chapel be lighted , Father Benedict . So soon as the aurora appears in the east , I shall celebrate mass , in thanksgiving for the blessing of a letter from the Holy Father , and for the safe return of my messenger . I shall not need your presence nor that of any of the brethren , save those whose watch it chances to be . . . . Benedicite . "
54047	54050	54052	54053	Father Benedict	180	" Deus , "
54093	54133	53953	53954	The Bishop	4673	" A bath , my lord , would be even more welcome than supper and bed . It shames me to have come in such travel - stained plight into your presence , and that of this noble knight , "
54141	54144	54146	54146	Hugh	132	" Nay , "
54153	54189	54146	54146	Hugh	132	" Travel - stains gained in such fashion , are more to be desired than silks and fine linen . I would I could go to rest this night knowing I had accomplished as much . "
54190	54199	54201	54202	the Bishop	4673	" Go and have thy bath , boy , "
54204	54254	54201	54202	the Bishop	4673	" This will give my monks time to tickle , catch , and cook , trout for thy supper ! Ah , thou young rascal ! But that field is Corban , remember . Sup well , rest well , and the blessing of the Lord be with thee . "
54651	54662	54635	54635	her	1599	" on her face the light of a purposeful radiance . "
54757	54760	54753	54754	the Bishop	4673	" Hugh ! "
54797	54807	54809	54810	the Bishop	4673	" This doth closely concern you , my son , "
55120	55125	55126	55126	he	764	" My Lord Bishop , "
55129	55134	55126	55126	he	764	" do I dream ? "
55140	55206	55135	55137	Symon of Worcester	154	" Nay , my son . Surely no dream of thine was ever signed by His Holiness , nor bore suspended from it the great seal of the Vatican ! The document you hold will be sufficient answer to all questions , and will ensure your wife 's position at Court and her standing in the outer world should she elect to re - enter it .
55207	55252	55111	55112	the Bishop	4673	" But whether she shall do this , or no , is not a matter upon which the Church would give a decisive or even an authoritative pronouncement ; and the Holy Father adds , in , his letter to me , further important instructions .
55253	55291	55135	55137	Symon of Worcester	154	" Firstly : that it must be the Prioress 's own wish and decision , apart from any undue pressure from without , to resign her office and to accept this dispensation , freeing her from her vows .
55292	55332	55111	55112	the Bishop	4673	" Secondly ; that she must leave the Nunnery and the neighbourhood , secretly ; if it be possible , appearing in her new position , as your wife , without much question being raised as to whence she came .
55333	55384	55135	55137	Symon of Worcester	154	" Thirdly : that when her absence becomes known in the Nunnery , I am authorized solemnly to announce that she has been moved on by me , secretly , with the knowledge and approval of the Holy Father , to a place where she was required for higher service . "
55426	55432	55433	55433	he	4673	" And , my lord , "
55437	55459	55433	55433	he	4673	" what news for her ! Shall you send it , in the morn , or yourself take it to her ? "
55472	55477	55478	55478	he	4673	" I know not , "
55483	55496	55478	55478	he	4673	" I know not that I shall either take or send it . "
55497	55518	55433	55433	he	4673	" But , my lord , surely ! It will settle all doubts , solve all questions , remove all difficulties "
55519	55526	55528	55529	the Bishop	4673	" Tut ! Tut ! Tut ! "
55531	55623	55528	55529	the Bishop	4673	" Good heavens , man ! Dare I we d you to a woman you know so little ? Not for one instant , into her consideration of the matter , will have entered any question as to what Church or State might say or do . For her the question stands upon simpler , truer , lines , not involved by rule or dogma : ' Is it right for me , or wrong for me ? Is it the will of God that I should do this thing ? ' "
55624	55649	55433	55433	he	4673	" But if you tell her , my lord , of the Holy Father 's dispensation and permission ; what will she then say ? "
55650	55657	55528	55529	the Bishop	4673	" What will she then say ? "
55674	55743	55658	55660	Symon of Worcester	154	" She will probably say : ' You amaze me , my lord ! Indeed , my lord , you amaze me ! His Holiness the Pope may rule at Rome ; you , my Lord Bishop , rule in the cities of this diocese ; but I rule in this Nunnery , and while I rule here , such a thing as this shall never be ! ' "
55769	55849	55433	55433	he	4673	" That is what the Prioress would probably say , my dear Knight , were I so foolish as to flaunt before her this most priceless parchment . And yet I know not . It may be wise to send it , or to show it without much comment , simply in order that she may see the effect upon the mind of the Holy Father himself , of a full knowledge of the complete facts of the case . "
55850	55854	55856	55857	the Knight	764	" My lord , "
55863	55875	55856	55857	the Knight	764	" how came that full knowledge to His Holiness in Rome ? "
55876	55884	55886	55887	the Bishop	4673	" When first you came to me , "
55889	56029	55886	55887	the Bishop	4673	" with this grievous tale of wrong and treachery , I knew that if you won your way with Mora , we must be armed with highest authority for the marriage and for her return to the world , or sorrow and much trial for her might follow , with , perhaps , danger for you . Therefore I resolved forthwith to lay the whole matter , without loss of time , before the Pope himself . I know the Holy Father well ; his openness of mind , his charity and kindliness ; his firm desire to do justly , and to love mercy . Moreover , his friendship for me is such , that he would not lightly refuse me a request . Also he would , of his kindness , incline to be guided by my judgment .
56030	56133	56160	56160	he	764	" Wherefore , no sooner were all the facts in my possession , those you told me , those I already knew , and those I did for myself deduce from both , than I sent for young Roger de Berchelai , whose wits and devotion I could safely trust , gave him all he would need for board and lodging , boats and steeds , that he might accomplish the journey in the shortest possible time , and despatched him to Rome with a written account of the whole matter , under my private seal , to His Holiness the Pope . "
56155	56159	56160	56160	he	764	" My lord , "
56348	56348	56340	56340	we	1652	"
56501	56645	56471	56471	he	154	" You overwhelm me , my dear Hugh , with your gratitude . It had not seemed to me that my action in this matter would demand either thanks or explanation . There are occasions when to do less than our best , would be to sin against all that which we hold most sacred . To my mind , the most useful definition of sin , in the sacred writings , is that of the apostle Saint James , most practical of all the inspired writers , when he said : ' To him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin . ' I knew quite clearly the ' good ' to be done in this case . Therefore no gratitude is due to me for failing to fall into the sin of omission .
56646	56681	56471	56471	he	154	" Also , my son , many who seem to deserve the gratitude of others , would be found not to deserve it , if the entire inward truth of motive could be fully revealed .
56682	56701	56471	56471	he	154	" With me it is well - nigh a passion that all good things should attain unto full completeness .
56702	56877	56471	56471	he	154	" It may be I was better able to give full understanding to your tale because , for love of a woman , I dwelt seven years in exile from this land , fearing lest my great love for her , which came to me all unsought , should by becoming known to her lead her young heart , as yet fresh and unawakened , to respond . There was never any question of breaking my vows ; and I hold not with love - friendships between man and woman , there where marriage is not possible . They are , at best , selfish on the part of the man . They keep the woman from entering into her kingdom . The crown of womanhood is to bear children to the man she loves to take her place in his home , as wife and mother . The man who can not offer this , yet stands in the way of the man who can , is a poor and an unworthy lover . "
56946	57009	56923	56923	he	4673	" It may be , my dear Hugh , that this heart discipline of mine of which , by the way , I have never before spoken has made me quick to understand the sufferings of other men . Also it may explain the great desire I always experience to see a truly noble woman come to the full completion of her womanhood .
57010	57166	57167	57168	the Bishop	4673	" I returned to England not long after your betrothed had entered the cloistered life in the Whytstone Nunnery . I was appointed to this See of Worcester , which appointment gave me the spiritual control of the White Ladies . My friendship with the Prioress has been a source of interest , pleasure , and true helpfulness to myself and I trust to her also . I think I told you while we supped that , many years ago , I had known her at the Court when I was confessor to the Queen , and preceptor to her ladies . But no mention has ever been made between the Prioress and myself of any previous acquaintance . I doubt whether she recognised , in the frail , white - haired , old prelate who arrived from Italy , the vigorous , bearded priest known to her , in her girlhood 's days , as "
57176	57181	57167	57168	the Bishop	4673	" as Father Gervaise . "
57182	57186	57192	57192	his	132	" Father Gervaise ! "
57217	57244	57198	57198	he	132	" Father Gervaise , my lord , perished in a stormy sea . The ship foundered , and none who sailed in her were seen again . "
57475	57629	57472	57472	he	4673	" True , the ship foundered , Hugh ; true , none who sailed in her were seen again . And , if I tell you that one swimmer , after long buffeting , was flung up on a rocky coast , lay for many weeks sick unto death in a fisherman 's humble cot , rose at last the frail shadow of his former self , to find that his hair had turned white in that desperate night , to find that none knew his name nor his estate , that leaving Father Gervaise and his failures at the bottom of the ocean he could shave his beard , and make his way to Rome under any name he pleased ; if I tell you all this , I trust you with a secret , Hugh , known to one other only , during all these years His Holiness , the Pope . "
57630	57633	57635	57636	the Knight	764	" Father ! "
57642	57644	57635	57636	the Knight	764	" Father "
57721	57724	57726	57726	Hugh	132	" Father , "
57735	57917	57732	57732	his	132	" in her last words to me , my mother spoke of you . I went to her chamber to bid her sleep well , and together we knelt before the crucifix . ' Let us repeat , ' whispered my mother , ' those holy words of comfort which Father Gervaise ever bid his penitents to say , as they kneeled before the dying Redeemer . ' ' Mother , ' said I , ' I know them not . ' ' Thou wert so young , my son , ' she said , ' when Father Gervaise last was with us . ' ' Tell me the words , ' I said ; ' I should like well to have them from thy lips . ' So , lifting her eyes to the dead Christ , my mother said , with awe and reverence in her voice and a deep gladness on her face : ' He ever liveth to make intercession for us . ' And , in the dawn of the new day , her spirit passed . "
57930	57934	57935	57935	he	4673	" My son , "
57938	57972	57935	57935	he	4673	" of all the women I have known , thy gentle mother bore the most beautiful and saintly character . I would there were more such as she , in our British homes . "
57973	57976	57978	57978	Hugh	132	" Father , "
57982	58207	57978	57978	Hugh	132	" knew you how much she had to bear ? My father 's fierce feuds with all , shut her up at last to utter loneliness . His anger against Holy Church and his contempt of Her priests , cost my mother the comfort of your visits . His life - long quarrel with Earl Eustace de Norelle caused that our families , though dwelling within a three hours ' ride , were allowed no intercourse . Never did I enter Castle Norelle until I rode up from the South , with a message for Mora from the King . And , to this day , Mora has never been within the courtyard of my home ! When we were betrothed , I dared not tell my parents though Earl Eustace and his Countess both were dead lest my father 's wrath might reach Mora , when I had gone . News of his death , chancing to me in a far - off land , brought me home . And truly , it was home indeed , at last ! Peace and content , where always there had been turbulence and strain . Father , I tell you this because I know my gentle mother feared you did not understand , and that you may have thought her love for you had failed . "
58213	58217	58218	58218	he	154	" Dear lad , "
58221	58225	58218	58218	he	154	" I understood . "
58226	58230	58232	58232	Hugh	132	" Ah why , "
58238	58268	58232	58232	Hugh	132	" why should a woman 's whole life be spoiled , and other lives be darkened and made sad , just by the angry , churlish , sullen whims of "
58269	58274	58276	58277	the Bishop	4673	" Hush , boy ! "
58281	58399	58276	58277	the Bishop	4673	" You speak of your father , and you name the Dead . Something dies in the Living , each time they speak evil of the Dead . I knew your father ; and , though he loved me not , yet , to be honest , I must say this of him : Sir Hugo was a good man and true ; upright , and a man of honour . He carried his shield untarnished . If he was feared by his friends , he was also feared by his foes . Brave he was and fearless . One thing he lacked ; and often , alas , they who lack just one thing , lack all .
58400	58621	58232	58232	Hugh	132	" Hugo d'Argent knew not love for his fellow - men . To be a man , was to earn his frown ; all things human called forth his disdain . To view the same landscape , breathe the same air , in fact walk the same earth as he , was to stand in his way , and raise his ire . Yet in his harsh , vexed manner he loved his wife , and loved his little son . Nor had he any self - conceit . He realised in himself his own worst foe . Lest we fall into this snare , it is well daily to pray : ' O Lover of Mankind , grant unto me truly to love my fellow - men ; to honour them , until they prove worthless ; to trust them , until they prove faithless ; and ever to expect better of them , than I expect of myself ; to think better of them , than I think of myself . ' Let us go through life , my son , searching for good in others , not for evil ; we may miss the good , if we search not for it ; the evil , alas , will find us , quite soon enough , unsought . "
58628	58631	58632	58632	he	1685	" Father , "
58635	58720	58632	58632	he	1685	" the starling ! Mind you the starling with the broken wing , which you and I found in the woods and carried home ; and you did set his wing , and tamed him , and taught him to say ' Hugh ' ? Each time I brought him food , you said : ' Hugh ! Hugh ! ' And soon the starling , seeing me coming , also said : ' Hugh ! Hugh ! ' Do you remember , Father ? "
58721	58726	58728	58729	the Bishop	4673	" I do remember , "
58731	58773	58728	58729	the Bishop	4673	" I see thee now , coming across the courtyard , bread and meat in thy hands a little lad , bareheaded in the sunshine , glowing with pleasure because the starling ran to meet thee , shouting ' Hugh ! ' "
58774	59028	58632	58632	he	1685	" Then listen , dear Father . Ah , how often have I wished to tell you this ! Soon after you were gone , that starling rudely taught me a hard lesson . Gaining strength , one day he left the courtyard , ran through the buttery , and wandered in the garden . I followed , whistling and watching . It greatly delighted the bird to find himself on turf . There had been rain . The grass was wet . Presently a rash worm , gliding from its hole , adventured forth . The starling ran to the worm , calling it ' Hugh . ' ' Hugh ! Hugh ! ' he cried , and tugged it from the earth . ' Hugh ! Hugh ! ' and pecked it , where helpless it lay squirming . Then , shouting ' Hugh ! ' once more , gobbled it down . I stood with heavy heart , for I had thought that starling loved me with a true , personal love , when he ran at my approach shouting my name . Yet now I knew it was the food I carried , he called ' Hugh ' ; it was the food , not me , he loved . Glad was I when , his wing grown strong , he flew away . It cut me to the heart to hear the worms , the grubs , the snails , the caterpillars , all called ' Hugh ' ! "
59036	59042	59043	59043	he	4673	" Poor little eager heart , "
59046	59162	59043	59043	he	4673	" learning so hard a lesson , all alone ! Yet is it a lesson , lad , sooner or later learned in sadness by all generous hearts . . . . And now , leaving the past , with all its memories , let us return to the present , and face the uncertain future . Also , dear Knight , I must ask you to remember , even when we are alone , that your old friend , Father Gervaise , in his brown habit , lies at the bottom of the ocean ; yet that your new friend , Symon of Worcester , holds you and your interests very near his heart . "
59222	59230	59231	59231	he	4673	" I thank you , my lord , "
59234	59248	59231	59231	he	4673	" for your great trust in me . I will not prove unworthy . "
59275	59331	59258	59259	The Bishop	92	" What were we saying , my dear Knight , when we strayed into a side issue ? Ah , I remember ! I was telling you of my appointment to the See of Worcester , and my belief that the Prioress failed to recognise in me , one she had known long years before . "
59346	59428	59258	59259	The Bishop	92	" I found the promise of that radiant girlhood more than fulfilled . She was changed ; she shewed obvious signs of having passed through the furnace ; but pure gold can stand the fire . The strength of purpose , the noble outlook upon life , the gracious tenderness for others , had matured and developed . Even the necessary restrictions of monastic life could not modify the grand lines both mental , and physical on which Nature had moulded her .
59429	59523	59258	59259	The Bishop	92	" I endeavoured to think no thoughts concerning her , other than should be thought of a holy lady who has taken vows of celibacy . Yet , seeing her so fitted to have made house home for a man , helping him upward , and to have been the mother of a fine race of sons and daughters , I felt it grievous that in leaving the world for a reason which in no sense could be considered a true vocation , she should have cut herself off from such powers and possibilities .
59524	59564	59258	59259	The Bishop	92	" So passed the years in the calm service of God and of the Church ; yet always I seemed aware that a crisis would come , and that , when that crisis came , she would need me . "
59684	59741	59680	59681	the Bishop	4673	" Therefore , my dear Hugh , when you arrived with your tale of wrong and treachery , all unconsciously to yourself , every word you spoke of your betrothed revealed her to the man who had loved her while you were yet a youth , with your spurs to win , and all life before you .
59742	59778	59680	59681	the Bishop	4673	" I saw in your arrival , and in the strange tale you told , a wondrous chance for her of that fuller development of life for which I knew her to be so perfectly fitted .
59779	59821	59680	59681	the Bishop	4673	" It had seemed indeed the irony of fate that , while I had fled and dwelt in exile lest my presence should hold her back from marriage , the treachery of others should have driven her into a life of celibacy .
59822	59902	59680	59681	the Bishop	4673	" Therefore while , with my tacit consent , you went to work in your own way , I sent my messenger to Rome bearing to the Holy Father a full account of all , petitioning a dispensation from vows taken owing to deception , and asking leave to unite in the holy sacrament of marriage these long - sundered lovers , undertaking that no scandal should arise therefrom , either in the Nunnery or in the City of Worcester .
59903	59959	59680	59681	the Bishop	4673	" As you have seen , my messenger this night returned ; and we now find ourselves armed with the full sanction of His Holiness , providing the Prioress , of her own free will , desires to renounce the high position she has won in her holy calling , and to come to you . "
59997	60006	60007	60007	he	764	" I greatly honour you , my lord , "
60010	60043	60007	60007	he	764	" and were our ages and conditions other than they are , so that we might fight for the woman we love , I should be proud to cross swords with you . "
60092	60168	60087	60087	Hugh	132	" Profoundly do I thank you , Reverend Father , for all that you have done ; and even more , for that which you did not do . It was six years after her first sojourn at the Court that I met Mora , loved her , and won her ; and well I know that the sweet love she gave to me was a love from which no man had brushed the bloom . "
60221	60251	60253	60253	Hugh	132	" And deeply do I love you , Reverend Father , for your wondrous goodness to her , and for her sake to me . And I pray heaven , "
60257	60287	60253	60253	Hugh	132	" that if she come to me , she may never know that she once won the love of so greatly better a man than he who won hers . "
60315	60319	60320	60320	he	154	" My son , "
60323	60358	60320	60320	he	154	" we are at one in desiring her happiness and highest good . For the rest , God , and her own pure heart , must guide her feet into the way of peace . "
60369	60451	60320	60320	he	154	" The aurora breaks in the east . The dawn is near . Come with me , Hugh , to the chapel . We pray for His Holiness , giving thanks for his gracious letter and mandate ; we praise for the safe return of my messenger . But we will also offer up devout petition that the Prioress may have clear light at this parting of the ways , and that our enterprise may be brought to a happy conclusion . "
60544	60548	60549	60549	she	1712	" Blessed Virgin , "
60552	60619	60549	60549	she	1712	" thou who lovedst Saint Joseph , being betrothed to him , yet didst keep thyself an holy shrine consecrate to the Lord and His need of thee oh , grant unto me strength to put from me this constant torment at the thought of his sufferings to whom once I gave my troth , and to reconsecrate myself wholly to the service of my Lord . "
60636	60642	60632	60633	the Knight	764	" Give her to me ! "
60648	60658	60644	60645	the Bishop	4673	" Guide her feet into the way of peace . "
60675	60696	60660	60661	the Prioress	373	" Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto Thee . "
61370	61379	61347	61347	she	175	" Devil take my old knee - joints ! "
61430	61438	61439	61439	he	4673	" Good - day , worthy Mother , "
61447	61542	61439	61439	he	4673	" The spirit is willing I know , but , in your case , the knee - joints are weak . But no wonder , for they have done you long service . Why , I get up slowly from kneeling , yet my knees are thirty years younger than yours . . . . Nay I will not mount to the Reverend Mother 's chamber until you acquaint her of my arrival . Take me round to the garden , and there let me wait in the shade , while you seek her . "
61638	61646	61647	61647	he	4673	" Not so fast , Sister Antony , "
61650	61677	61647	61647	he	4673	" I pray you to remember mine age , and to moderate your pace . Why should you expect trouble or anxiety for the Reverend Mother ? "
61678	61681	61683	61684	Mary Antony	85	" Nay , "
61686	61743	61683	61684	Mary Antony	85	" I expect naught ; I saw naught ; I heard naught ! ' Twas all mine own mistake , counting with my peas . I told the Reverend Mother so , and set her mind at rest by carrying up six peas , saying that I had found six and not five in my wallet . "
61744	61749	61751	61752	the Bishop	4673	" Let us pause , "
61754	61800	61751	61752	the Bishop	4673	" and look at this lily . How lovely are its petals . How tall and white it shews against the hedge . Why did you need to set the Reverend Mother 's mind at rest , Sister Antony , by carrying up six peas ? "
61801	61804	61806	61810	the old lay - sister	264	" Because , "
61812	61974	61806	61810	the old lay - sister	264	" when I had counted as they returned , the twenty holy ladies who had gone to Vespers , yet another passed making twenty - one . Upon which I ran and reported to the Reverend Mother , saying in my folly , that I feared the twenty - first was Sister Agatha , returned to walk amongst the Living , she being over fifty years numbered with the Dead . Yet many a time , just before dawn , have I heard her rapping on the cloister door ; aye , many a time tap ! tap ! tap ! But what good would there be in opening to a poor lady you helped thrust into her shroud , nigh upon sixty years before ? So ' Tap away ! ' says I ; ' tap away , Sister Agatha ! Try Saint Peter at the gates of Paradise . Old Antony knows better than to let you in . ' "
61975	61992	61994	61995	the Bishop	4673	" What said the Reverend Mother when you reported on a twenty - first White Lady ? "
61997	62015	61994	61995	the Bishop	4673	" Reverend Mother bid me begone , while she herself dealt with the wraith of Sister Agatha . "
62016	62024	62026	62027	the Bishop	4673	" And why did you not go ? "
62112	62116	62117	62117	he	4673	" Sister Antony , "
62138	62269	62125	62125	his	4673	" you and I , dear Sister Antony , love the Reverend Mother so truly and so faithfully , that there is nothing we would not do , to save her a moment 's pain . We know how noble and how good she is ; and that she will always decide aright , and follow in the footsteps of our blessed Lady and all the holy saints . But others there are , who do not love her as we love her , or know her as we know her ; and they might judge her wrongly . Therefore we must tell to none , that which we know how the Reverend Mother , alone , dealt with that visitor , who was not the wraith of Sister Agatha . "
62303	62308	62309	62309	she	85	" I know naught , "
62312	62321	62309	62309	she	85	" I saw naught ; I heard naught . "
62326	62339	62322	62323	The Bishop	4673	" How many peas were left in your wallet , Sister Antony ? "
62340	62343	62345	62346	Mary Antony	85	" Five , "
62348	62359	62322	62323	The Bishop	4673	" Why did you shew six to the Reverend Mother ? "
62360	62368	62370	62374	the old lay - sister	264	" To set her mind at rest , "
62376	62395	62322	62323	The Bishop	4673	" To cause her to think that you had heard naught , seen naught , and knew naught ? "
62403	62408	62410	62411	the Bishop	4673	" Faithful old heart ! "
62413	62420	62410	62411	the Bishop	4673	" What gave thee this thought ? "
62421	62439	62440	62441	The Bishop	4673	" Our blessed Lady , in answer to her petition , sharpened the wits of old Antony . "
62444	62453	62454	62454	he	4673	" May our blessed Lady keep them sharp , "
62460	62463	62465	62466	Mary Antony	85	" Amen , "
62568	62580	62581	62581	he	4673	" Already I have been received with obeisance , my daughter , "
62640	62644	62646	62647	the Bishop	4673	" What peas ? "
62682	62699	62701	62702	the Prioress	373	" And a large , white pea , chosen for its fine aspect , was myself , "
62704	62770	62701	62702	the Prioress	373	" and , leaving the Sub - Prioress and Sister Mary Rebecca , Master Robin swooped down and flew off with me ! Hearing cries of distress , I hastened hither , to find Mary Antony denouncing the robin as ' Knight of the Bloody Vest , ' and making loud lamentations over my abduction . Her imaginings become more real to her than realities . "
62771	62778	62780	62781	the Bishop	4673	" She hath a faithful heart , "
62783	62789	62780	62781	the Bishop	4673	" and a shrewd wit . "
62790	62795	62797	62798	the Prioress	373	" Faithful ? Aye , "
62800	62823	62797	62798	the Prioress	373	" faithful and loving . Yet it is but lately I have realised , the love , beneath her carefulness and devotion . "
62843	62883	62827	62827	her	91	" How quickly , in these places , we lose the very remembrance of the meaning of personal , human love . We grow so soon accustomed to allowing ourselves to dwell only upon the abstract or the divine . "
62884	62890	62892	62893	the Bishop	4673	" That is a loss , "
62906	62963	62895	62895	He	4673	" a grievous loss , my daughter . Sooner than that you should suffer that loss , beyond repair , I would let the daring Knight of the Bloody Vest carry you off on swift wing . Better a robin 's nest , if , love be there , than a nunnery full of dead hearts . "
62981	62996	62998	62999	the Bishop	4673	" ' And now abideth faith , hope , love , these three , ' "
63001	63012	62998	62999	the Bishop	4673	" ' but the greatest of these is love . ' "
63037	63043	63044	63044	she	373	" This , my lord , "
63055	63078	63044	63044	she	373	" is the abode of Faith and Hope , and also of that divine Love , which excelleth both Hope and Faith . "
63079	63082	63084	63085	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
63087	63171	63173	63174	the Bishop	4673	" I pray you , listen . ' Love suffereth long , and is kind ; love envieth not ; love vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ; doth not behave itself unseemly ; seeketh not her own ; is not easily provoked , thinking no evil ; rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ; beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things . Love never faileth . ' Methinks , "
63191	63212	63184	63184	he	4673	" the apostle was speaking of a most human love ; yet he rated it higher than faith and hope . "
63213	63226	63228	63229	the Prioress	373	" Are you still dwelling upon Sister Mary Seraphine , my lord ? "
63244	63251	63253	63254	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , my dear Prioress , "
63273	63371	63265	63265	his	4673	" I speak not of self - love , nor does the apostle whose words I quote . I take it , he writes of human love , sanctified ; upborne by faith and hope , yet greater than either ; just as a bird is greater than its wings , yet can not mount without them . We must have faith , we must have hope ; then our poor earthly loves can rise from the lower level of self - seeking and self - pleasing and take their place among those things that are eternal . "
63411	63436	63404	63404	her	91	" Why this talk of earthly loves , my Lord Bishop , in a place where all earthly love has been renounced and forgotten ? "
63465	63479	63437	63438	The Bishop	4673	" Because , my daughter , I am here to plead for Hugh . "
63487	63491	63493	63494	the Prioress	373	" For Hugh ? "
63507	63520	63493	63494	the Prioress	373	" For Hugh ! What know you of Hugh , my lord ? "
63537	63726	63521	63522	The Bishop	4673	" I know that in breaking your solemn troth to him , you are breaking a very noble heart ; and that in leaving his home desolate , you are robbing him not only of his happiness but also of his faith . Men are apt to rate our holy religion , not by its theories , but by the way in which it causeth us to act in our dealings with them . If you condemn Hugh to sit beside his hearth , through the long years , a lonely , childless man , you take the Madonna from his home ; if you take your love from him , I greatly fear lest you should also rob him of his belief in the love of God . I do not say that these things should be so ; I say that we must face the fact that thus they are . And remember between a man and woman of noble birth , each with a stainless escutcheon , each believing the other to be the soul of honour , a broken troth is no light matter . "
63727	63735	63737	63738	the Prioress	373	" I did not break my troth , "
63740	63785	63737	63738	the Prioress	373	" until I believed that Hugh had broken his . I had suffered sore anguish of heart and humiliation of spirit , over the news of his marriage with his cousin Alfrida , ere I resolved to renounce the world and enter the cloister . "
63786	63801	63803	63804	the Bishop	4673	" But Hugh did not we d his cousin , nor any other woman , "
63806	63839	63803	63804	the Bishop	4673	" He was true to you in every thought and act , even after he also had passed through sore anguish of heart by reason of your supposed marriage with another suitor . "
63840	63851	63853	63854	the Prioress	373	" I learned the truth but a few days since , "
63856	63892	63853	63854	the Prioress	373	" For seven long years I thought Hugh false to me . For seven long years I believed him the husband of another woman , and schooled myself to forget every memory of past tenderness . "
63893	63899	63901	63902	the Bishop	4673	" You were both deceived , "
63904	63926	63901	63902	the Bishop	4673	" You have both passed through deep waters . You each owe it to the other to make all possible reparation . "
63927	63933	63935	63936	the Prioress	373	" For seven holy years , "
63940	63949	63935	63936	the Prioress	373	" I have been the bride of Christ . "
63950	63956	63958	63959	the Bishop	4673	" Do you love Hugh ? "
64345	64351	64354	64355	the Bishop	4673	" Do you love Hugh ? "
64387	64396	64358	64359	the Prioress	373	" Alas , my lord , I do . "
64435	64442	64444	64445	the Bishop	4673	" ' Love never faileth , ' "
64483	64594	64596	64597	the Prioress	373	" My Lord Bishop , you have wrung from me a confession of my love ; but in so doing , you have wrung from me a confession of sin . A nun may not yield to such love as Hugh d'Argent still desires to win from me . With long hours of prayer and vigil , have I sought to purge my soul from the stain of a weak yielding even for ' a moment ' to the masterful insistence of this man , who forced himself , by the subterfuge of a sacrilegious masquerade , into the sacred precincts of our Nunnery . I know not whom he bribed "
64609	64617	64619	64621	Symon of Worcester	154	" ' Love thinking no evil , ' "
64623	64751	64596	64597	the Prioress	373	" But I do know , that somebody in high authority must have connived at his plotting , or he could not have found himself alone in the crypt at the hour of Vespers , in such wise as to assume our dress and , mingling with the returning procession , gain entrance to the cloisters . And somebody must still be aiding and abetting his plans , or he could not be , as he himself told me he would be , daily in the crypt alone , during the hour when we pass to and from the clerestory . It angers me , my lord , to think that one who should , in this , be on my side , taketh part against me . "
64752	64760	64762	64763	the Bishop	4673	" ' Is not easily provoked , ' "
64765	64775	64777	64778	the Prioress	373	" In fact I am tempted , my lord , "
64789	64810	64777	64778	the Prioress	373	" I am almost tempted , my Lord Bishop , to forget the reverence which I owe to your high office "
64811	64820	64822	64824	Symon of Worcester	154	" ' Doth not behave itself unseemly , ' "
65029	65033	65034	65034	she	373	" Reverend Father , "
65037	65182	65034	65034	she	373	" I pray you to pardon my too swift indignation . To you I look to aid me in this time of difficulty . I grieve for the sorrow and disappointment to a brave and noble knight , a loyal lover , and a most faithful heart . But I can not reward faith with un - faith . If I broke my sacred vows in order to give myself to him , I should not bring a blessing to his home . Better an empty hearth than a hearth where broods a curse . Besides , we never could live down the scandal caused . I should be anathema to all . The Pope himself would doubtless excommunicate us . It would mean endless sorrow for me , and danger for Hugh . On these grounds , alone , it can not be . "
65196	65200	65201	65201	he	4673	" My daughter , "
65204	65368	65201	65201	he	4673	" when Hugh came to me with his grievous tale of treachery and loss , he refused to give me the name of the woman he sought , saying only that he believed she was to be found among the White Ladies of Worcester . When I asked her name he answered : ' Nay , I guard her name , as I would guard mine honour . If I fail to win her back ; if she withhold herself from me , so that I ride away alone ; then must I ride away leaving no shadow of reproach on her fair fame . Her name will be for ever in my heart , ' said Hugh , ' but no word of mine shall have left it , in the mind of any man , linked with a broken troth or a forsaken lover . ' I tell you this , my daughter , lest you should misjudge a very loyal knight .
65369	65410	65549	65549	she	91	" But no true lover was ever a diplomat . Hugh had not talked long with me , before you stood clearly revealed . A few careful questions settled the matter , beyond a doubt . Whereupon , my dear Prioress "
65432	65438	65549	65549	she	91	" Whereupon , my lord ? "
65439	65526	65549	65549	she	91	" Whereupon I realised an early dream of mine seemed promised a possible fulfilment . I knew Hugh as a lad It is a veritable passion with me that all things should attain unto their full perfection In short , I sent a messenger to Rome , bearing a careful account of the whole matter , in a private letter from myself to His Holiness the Pope . Last evening , my messenger returned , bringing a letter from the Holy Father , with this enclosed . "
65566	65569	65570	65570	she	91	" What ! "
65573	65602	65570	65570	she	91	" The name and rank I resigned on entering this Order ! Who dares to write or speak of me as ' Mora , Countess of Norelle ' ? "
65603	65616	65618	65619	the Bishop	4673	" Merely His Holiness the Pope , and the Bishop of Worcester , "
65662	65665	65667	65668	the Prioress	373	" Dispensation ! "
65670	65673	65674	65674	she	91	" Absolution ! "
65697	65786	65787	65787	She	91	" ' Empowers Symon , Lord Bishop of Worcester , or any priest he may appoint , to unite in the holy sacrament of marriage the Knight - Crusader , Hugh d'Argent , and Mora de Norelle , sometime Prioress of the White Ladies of Worcester . ' Sometime Prioress ? In very truth , they have dared so to write it ! SOMETIME Prioress ! It will be well they should understand she is Prioress NOW not some time or any time , but NOW and HERE ! "
65793	65865	65787	65787	She	91	" My lord , the Church seems to be bringing its powers to bear on the side of the World , the Flesh , and the Devil , leaving a woman and her conscience to stand alone and battle unaided with the grim forces arrayed against her . But you shall see that she knows how to deal with any weapon of the adversary which happens to fall into her hands . "
65898	65903	65904	65904	she	91	" Thus I answer , "
65907	65978	65904	65904	she	91	" your attempt , my lord , to induce the Pope to release me from vows which I hold to be eternally sacred and binding . And if you are bent upon divorcing a nun from her Heavenly Union , and making her to become the chattel of a man , you must seek her elsewhere than in the Convent of the White Ladies of Worcester , my Lord Bishop ! "
66240	66243	66244	66244	she	1853	" Alas , "
66247	66338	66244	66244	she	1853	" what have I done ! In my pride and arrogance , I have spoken ill to you , my lord , who have ever shewn me most considerate kindness ; and in a moment of ill - judged resentment , I have committed sacrilege against the Holy Father , rending the deed which bears his signature . Alas , woe is me ! In striving to do right , I have done most grievous wrong ; in seeking not to sin , lo , I have sinned beyond belief ! "
66450	66533	66444	66445	the Bishop	4673	" We did not mean to overrule your judgment , or to force your inclination , my daughter . If we appear to have done so , the blame is mine alone . This mandate is drawn up entirely along the lines of my suggestion , owing to my influence with His Holiness , and based upon particulars furnished by me . Now let me read to you the private letter from the Holy Father to myself , giving further important conditions . "
66761	66765	66767	66768	the Prioress	373	" Higher service , "
66775	66816	66767	66768	the Prioress	373	" Higher service ? Can it be that the Holy Father really speaks of the return to earthly love and marriage , the pleasures of the world , and the joys of home life , as ' higher service ' ? "
66837	66850	66851	66851	he	4673	" Mine was the phrase , to begin with , my daughter , "
66854	66980	66851	66851	he	4673	" I used it to the Holy Father , and I confess that , in using it , I did mean to convey that which , as you well know . I have long believed , that wifehood and motherhood , if worthily performed , may rank higher in the Divine regard than vows of celibacy . But , in adopting the expression , the Holy Father , we may rest assured , had no thought of undervaluing the monastic life , or the high position within it to which you have attained . I should rather take it that he was merely accepting my assurance that the new vocation to which you were called would , in your particular case , be higher service . "
67167	67172	67173	67173	he	4673	" Oh , child , "
67176	67244	67173	67173	he	4673	" you love Hugh ! Can you let him ride forth alone , accompanied only by the grim spectres of unfaith and of despair ? His hope , his faith , his love , all centre in you . Another Prioress can be found for this Nunnery . No other bride can be found for Hugh d'Argent . He will have his own betrothed , or none . "
67262	67266	67267	67267	she	373	" Reverend Father , "
67270	67332	67267	67267	she	373	" I will not go to the man I love , trailing broken vows , like chains , behind me . There could be no harmony in life 's music . Whene'er I moved , where'er I trod , I should hear the constant clanking of those chains . No man can set me free from vows made to God . But "
67365	67427	67358	67358	Hugh	132	" Blessed Virgin . . . help this woman of mine to understand that if she break her troth to me , holding herself from me , now , when I am come to claim her , she sends me out to an empty life , to a hearth beside which no woman will sit , to a home forever desolate . "
67428	67431	67433	67434	the Bishop	4673	" But ? "
67439	67447	67433	67434	the Bishop	4673	" Yes , my daughter ? But ? "
67448	67569	67570	67571	The Bishop	4673	" But if our blessed Lady herself vouchsafed me a clear sign that my first duty is to Hugh , if she absolved me from my vows , making it evident that God 's will for me is that , leaving the Cloister , I should we d Hugh and dwell with him in his home ; then I would strive to bring myself to do this thing . But I can take release from none save from our Lord , to Whom those vows were made , or from our Lady , who knoweth the heart of a woman , and whose grace hath been with me all through the strivings and conflicts of the years that are past . "
67574	67577	67578	67578	he	4673	" Alas , "
67581	67587	67578	67578	he	4673	" alas , poor Hugh ! "
67690	67696	67684	67685	the Bishop	4673	" Alas , poor Hugh ! "
67733	67739	67740	67740	she	373	" Alas , my lord , "
67743	67780	67740	67740	she	373	" you were witness of my grievous sin in thus rending the gracious message of His Holiness . Will it please you to appoint me a penance , if such an act can indeed be expiated ? "
67781	67889	67716	67717	The Prioress	373	" The sin , my daughter , as I will presently explain , is scarcely so great as you think it . But , such as it is , it arose from a lack of calmness and of that mental equipoise which sails unruffled through a sea of contradiction . The irritability which results in displays of sudden temper is so foreign to your nature that it points to your having passed through a time of very special strain , both mental and physical ; probably overlong vigils and fastings , while you wrestled with this anxious problem upon which so much , in the future , depends .
67890	67927	67740	67740	she	373	" As you ask me for penance , I will give you two : one which will set right your ill - considered action ; the other which will help to remedy the cause of that action .
67928	67958	67716	67717	The Prioress	373	" The first is , that you place these fragments together and , taking a fresh piece of vellum , make a careful copy of this writing which you destroyed .
67959	68027	67740	67740	she	373	" The second is that , in order to regain the usual equipoise of your mental attitude , you ride to - day , for an hour , in the river meadow . My white palfrey , Iconoklastes , shall be in the courtyard at noon . Yesterday , my daughter , you rode for pleasure . To - day you will ride for penance ; and incidentally "
68047	68075	68077	68078	the Bishop	4673	" incidentally , my daughter , you will work off a certain stiffness from which you must be suffering , after the unwonted exercise . Ah me ! "
68080	68140	68077	68078	the Bishop	4673	" that is ever the Divine method . Punishments should be remedial , as well as deterrent . There is much stiffness of mind of which we must be rid before we can stoop to the portal of God 's ' whosoever ' and , passing through the narrow gate , enter the Kingdom of Heaven as little children . "
68158	68162	68163	68163	she	373	" My lord , "
68166	68201	68163	68163	she	373	" as ever you are most kind to me . Yet I fear you have been too lenient for my own peace of mind . To have destroyed in anger the mandate of His Holiness "
68202	68208	68210	68211	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , my daughter , "
68213	68311	68210	68211	the Bishop	4673	" The mandate of His Holiness , inscribed upon parchment , from which hangs the great seal of the Vatican , is safely placed among my most precious documents . You have but destroyed the result of an hour 's careful work . I rose betimes this morning to make this copy . I should not have allowed you to tear it , had not the writing been my own . But I took pains to reproduce exactly the peculiar style of lettering they use in Rome , and you will do the same in your copy . "
68390	68393	68394	68394	he	4673	" Remember , "
68397	68413	68394	68394	he	4673	" Hugh rides away to - morrow night ; rides away , never to return . "
68421	68458	68414	68414	Her	373	" He had better have ridden away five days ago , my lord . He had my answer , and I bade him go . By staying he has but prolonged his suspense and my pain . "
68459	68462	68464	68465	the Bishop	4673	" Yes , "
68468	68489	68464	68465	the Bishop	4673	" he had better have ridden away ; or , better still , have never come upon this fruitless quest . "
68510	68517	68519	68520	the Prioress	373	" Your blessing , Reverend Father , "
68525	68528	68530	68531	the Bishop	4673	" Benedicite , "
68602	68619	68588	68588	He	4673	" Take care of her , Sister Antony . I have left her in some distress . "
68620	68626	68628	68632	the old lay - sister	264	" Hath she decided aright ? "
68634	68640	68642	68643	the Bishop	4673	" She always decides aright , "
68645	68748	68642	68643	the Bishop	4673	" But she is so made that she will thrust happiness from her with both hands unless our Lady should herself offer it , by vision or revelation . I could wish thy gay little Knight of the Bloody Vest might indeed fly with her to his nest and teach her a few sweet lessons , in the green privacy of some leafy paradise . But I tell thee too much , worthy Mother . Keep a silent tongue in that shrewd old head of thine . Minister to her ; and send word to me if I am needed . Benedicite . "
68969	68979	68981	68982	the Knight	764	" To - morrow , in the early morn , "
68984	69034	68981	68982	the Knight	764	" I send her tire - woman on to Warwick , with all her effects , keeping back only the riding suit . Should she elect to come , we must be free to ride without drawing rein . Even so we shall reach Warwick only something before midnight . "
69035	69047	69049	69050	the Bishop	4673	" She tore it up and planted her foot upon it , "
69052	69060	69062	69063	the Knight	764	" I will not give up hope , "
69065	69088	68981	68982	the Knight	764	" Nothing short of a miracle , my son , will change her mind , or move her from her fixed resolve . "
69089	69098	69100	69101	the Knight	764	" Then our Lady will work a miracle , "
69104	69120	69100	69101	the Knight	764	" I prayed ' Send her to me ! ' and our blessed Lady smiled . "
69121	69150	68981	68982	the Knight	764	" A sculptured smile , dear lad , is ever there . Had you prayed ' Hold her from me ! ' our Lady would equally have smiled . "
69151	69154	69156	69157	the Knight	764	" Nay , "
69159	69167	69156	69157	the Knight	764	" I keep my trust in prayer . "
69177	69182	69184	69185	the Knight	764	" I was successful , "
69187	69286	69184	69185	the Knight	764	" in dealing with Eustace , her nephew . There will be no need to apply to the King . The ambition was his mother 's . Now Eleanor is dead , he cares not for the Castle . Next month he weds an heiress , with large estates , and has no wish to lay claim to Mora 's home . All is now once more as it was when she left it . Her own people are in charge . I plan to take her there when we leave Warwick , riding northward by easy stages . "
69334	69413	69330	69331	the Bishop	4673	" Hugh , my dear lad , she thought it was the Pope 's own deed and signature , yet she tore it across , and then again across ; flung it upon the ground , and set her foot upon it . I deem it now as impossible that the Prioress should change her mind upon this matter , as that we should ever see again that stone which now lies deep on the river - bed . "
69468	69475	69476	69476	he	4673	" Bravely done , my son ! "
69487	69493	69476	69476	he	4673	" You deserve to win . "
69500	69529	69497	69497	he	4673	" Fighting men and quick - witted women will be ever with us , gaining their ends by strenuous endeavour . But the age of miracles is past . "
69536	69541	69542	69542	he	132	" I shall win , "
69577	69583	69584	69584	he	4673	" Go in , boy , "
69587	69657	69584	69584	he	4673	" and get dry . Send thy man for another suit , unless it would please thee better that Father Benedict should lend thee a cassock ! Give me the stone . It may well serve as a reminder of that famous sacred stone from which the Convent takes its name . Methinks we have , between us , contrived something of an omen , concluding in thy favour . "
69687	69695	69696	69696	he	4673	" The age of miracles is past , "
69700	69730	69696	69696	he	4673	" Iron no longer swims , neither do stones rise from the depths of a river , unless the Divine command be supplemented by the grip of strong human fingers .
69731	69782	69783	69784	The Bishop	4673	" Stand there , thou little tombstone of our hopes . Mark the place where lies the Holy Father 's mandate , ecclesiastically all - powerful , yet rendered null and void by the faithful conscience and the firm will of a woman . God send us more such women ! "
69811	69817	69818	69818	he	4673	" Dry this , Jasper , "
69821	69872	69818	69818	he	4673	" and bring me another somewhat larger . These dainty trifles can not serve , when ' tears run down like a river . ' Nay , look not distressed , my good fellow . I do but jest . Yonder wet Knight hath given me a shower - bath . "
70492	70564	70484	70485	the Prioress	373	" Gone ! . . . But it was at our Lady 's bidding . . . . Flown ? Ah , gay little Knight of the Bloody Vest ! Nay , it must have been the archangel Gabriel , or maybe Saint George , in shining armour . . . . How shall we live without the Reverend Mother ? But the will of our blessed Lady must be done . "
70565	70568	70570	70571	the Prioress	373	" Antony ! "
70573	70613	70570	70571	the Prioress	373	" Wake up , dear Antony ! You are dreaming again . You are thinking of the robin and the pea . I have not gone from you ; nor am I going . See ! I am here . "
70741	70749	70751	70752	the Prioress	373	" Thou art better , dear Antony , "
70754	70785	70751	70752	the Prioress	373	" They tell me thy strength has returned , and this strange fainting is over . Thou must lie still yet awhile ; but will it weary thee to speak ? "
70786	70826	70717	70718	the Prioress	373	" Nay , Reverend Mother , I should dearly love to speak . My soul is full of wonder ; yet to none saving to you , Reverend Mother , can I tell of that which I have seen . "
70827	70835	70837	70838	the Prioress	373	" Tell me all , dear Antony , "
70840	70853	70837	70838	the Prioress	373	" Sister Mary Rebecca says thy symptoms point to a Divine Vision . "
70858	70868	70869	70869	she	85	" For once Sister Mary Rebecca speaks the truth , "
70872	70888	70869	70869	she	85	" Have patience with me , Reverend Mother , and I will tell you all . "
71009	71016	71018	71021	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" She will outlive us all , "
71036	71044	71046	71048	Sister Mary Rebecca	90	" She is like an ancient parrot , "
71073	71083	71084	71084	she	90	" Please God , I shall live long enough , "
71087	71112	71084	71084	she	90	" to thrust Mother Sub - Prioress into a sackcloth shroud ; also , to crack nuts upon the sepulchre of Sister Mary Rebecca . "
71172	71183	71185	71186	the Prioress	373	" There is no need for patience , dear Antony , "
71188	71209	71185	71186	the Prioress	373	" I can sit in stillness beside thee , until thy tale be fully told . Begin at the beginning . "
71248	71255	71257	71258	Mary Antony	85	" I was in the cloisters , "
71260	71271	71257	71258	Mary Antony	85	" awaiting the return from Vespers of the holy Ladies . "
71380	71423	71331	71334	the great Lord Bishop	1748	" ' So turn out thy toes , and make thy best bow , and behave thee as a little layman should behave in the presence of one who hath been mistaken for one holding so high an office in Holy Church . '
71424	71427	71429	71430	Mary Antony	85	" Thus , "
71432	71451	71429	71430	Mary Antony	85	" had I planned to strike awe into the little red breast of that over - bold robin . "
71452	71461	71463	71464	the Prioress	373	" And came the robin to the cloisters ? "
71519	71533	71534	71534	she	373	" The great Lord Bishop did address me as ' worthy Mother , ' "
71537	71788	71534	71534	she	373	" not ' Reverend Mother , ' as we address our noble Prioress . And this has given me much food for thought . Is it better to be worthy and not reverend , or reverend and not worthy ? Our large white sow , when she did contrive to have more little pigs in her litters , than ever our sows had before ; and , after a long and fruitful life , furnished us with two excellent hams , a boar 's head , and much bacon , was a worthy sow ; but never was she reverend , not even when Mother Sub - Prioress pronounced the blessing over her face , much beautified by decoration grand ivory tusks , and a lemon in her mouth ! Never , in life , had she looked so fair ; which is indeed , I believe , the case with many . Yet , for all her worthiness , she was not reverend . Also I have heard tell of a certain Prior , not many miles from here , who , borrowing money , never repays it ; who oppresses the poor , driving them from the Priory gate ; who maltreats the monks , and is kind unto none , saving unto himself . He it seems is reverend but not worthy . While thou , Master Redbreast , art certainly not reverend ; the saints , and thine own conscience , alone know whether thou art worthy .
71789	71792	71794	71795	Mary Antony	85	" This , "
71797	71813	71794	71795	Mary Antony	85	" was how I had planned to point a moral to that jaunty little worldling . "
71814	71826	71828	71829	the Prioress	373	" They who are reverend must strive to be also worthy , "
71831	71863	71828	71829	the Prioress	373	" while they who count themselves to be worthy , must think charitably of those to whom they owe reverence . Came the robin to thee in the cloisters , Antony ? "
71910	71931	71873	71873	her	430	" Aye , he came . But not for crumbs ; not for cheese ; not to gossip with old Antony .
71932	71946	71873	71873	her	430	" He stood upon the coping , looking at me with his bright eye .
71947	71962	71873	71873	her	430	" ' Well , little vain man ! ' said I. But he moved not .
71963	71995	71873	71873	her	430	" ' Well , Master Pieman , ' I said , ' art come to spy on holy ladies ? ' But never a flutter , never a chirp , gave he .
71996	72067	71873	71873	her	430	" So grave and yet war - like was his aspect , that at length I said : ' Well , Knight of the Bloody Vest ! Hast thou come to carry off again our noble Prioress ? ' Upon which , instantly , he lifted up his voice , and burst into song ; then flew to the doorway , turning and chirping , as if asking me to follow .
72068	72091	71873	71873	her	430	" Greatly marvelling at this behaviour on the part of the little bird I love , I forthwith set out to follow him .
72092	72145	71873	71873	her	430	" Along the passage , on swift wing , he flew ; in and out of the empty cells , as if in search of something . ' Then , while I was yet some little way behind , he vanished into the Reverend Mother 's cell , and came not forth again .
72146	72193	71873	71873	her	430	" Laughing to myself at such presumption , I followed , saying : ' Ha , thou Knight of the Bloody Vest ! What doest thou there ? The Reverend Mother is away . What seekest thou in her chamber , Knight of the Bloody Vest ? '
72194	72214	71873	71873	her	430	" But , reaching the doorway , at that moment , I found myself struck dumb by what I saw .
72215	72270	71873	71873	her	430	" No robin was there , but a most splendid Knight , in shining armour , kneeled upon his knees before the shrine of our Lady . A blood - red cross was on his breast . His dark head was uplifted . On his noble face was a look of pleading and of prayer .
72271	72389	71873	71873	her	430	" Marvelling , but unafraid , I crept in , and kneeled behind that splendid Knight . The look of pleading upon his face , inclined me also to prayer . His lips moved , as I had seen at the first ; but while I stood upon my feet , I could hear no words . As soon as I too kneeled , I heard the Knight saying : ' Give her to me ! Give her to me ! ' And at last : ' Mother of God , send her to me ! Take pity on a hungry heart , a lonely home , a desolate hearth , and send her to me ! ' "
72457	72477	72429	72429	She	85	" When the splendid Knight said : ' Send her to me , ' a most wondrous thing did happen .
72478	72499	72429	72429	She	85	" Our blessed Lady , lifting her head , looked toward the door . Then raising her hand , she beckoned .
72500	72547	72429	72429	She	85	" No sooner did our Lady beckon , than I heard steps coming along the passage that passage which I knew to be empty . The Knight heard them , also ; for his heart began to beat so loudly that kneeling behind I could hear it .
72548	72553	72429	72429	She	85	" Our blessed Lady smiled .
72554	72605	72429	72429	She	85	" Then in through the doorway came the Reverend Mother , walking with her head held high , and sunlight in her eyes , as I have ofttimes seen her walk in the garden in Springtime , when the birds are singing , and a scent of lilac is all around .
72606	72629	72429	72429	She	85	" She did not see old Mary Antony ; but moving straight to where the Knight was kneeling , kneeled down beside him .
72630	72697	72429	72429	She	85	" Then the splendid Knight did hold out his hand . But the Reverend Mother 's hands were clasped upon the cross at her breast , and she would not put her hand into the Knight 's ; but lifting her eyes to our Lady she said : ' Holy Mother of God , except thou thyself send me to him , I can not go . "
72698	72725	72429	72429	She	85	" And again the Knight said : ' Give her to me ! Give her to me ! Blessed Virgin , give her to me ! ' "
72767	72774	72429	72429	She	85	" Then a wondrous thing did happen .
72775	72806	72429	72429	She	85	" Stooping from her marble throne our Lady leaned , and taking the Reverend Mother 's hand in hers , placed it herself in the outstretched hand of the Knight . "
72840	72860	72429	72429	She	85	" ' TAKE HER ; SHE HATH BEEN EVER THINE . I HAVE BUT KEPT HER FOR THEE . ' "
72861	72897	72429	72429	She	85	" When I lifted my head once more , the Reverend Mother and the splendid Knight had risen . Heaven was in their eyes . Her hand was in his . His arm was around her .
72898	72919	72429	72429	She	85	" As I looked , they turned together , passed out through the doorway , and paced slowly down the passage .
72920	72943	72429	72429	She	85	" I heard their steps growing fainter and yet more faint , until they reached the cloisters . Then all was still . "
72944	72977	72429	72429	She	85	" Then I heard other steps arriving . I still kneeled on , fearful to move ; because those earthly steps were drowning the sound of the silver chimes which filled the air .
72978	72993	72429	72429	She	85	" Then why , then I saw the Reverend Mother , returned and returned alone .
72994	73061	72429	72429	She	85	" So I cried out , because she had left that splendid Knight . And , as I cried , the silver bells fell silent , all grew dark around me , and I knew no more , until I woke up in mine own bed , tended by Sister Mary Rebecca , and Sister Teresa ; with Abigail noisy hussy ! helping to fetch and carry .
73062	73114	72429	72429	She	85	" But when I close mine eyes Ah , then ! Yes , I hear again the sound of silver chimes . And some day I shall hear shall hear again that wondrous voice of voice of tenderness , which said : ' Take her , she hath been ever ever ' "
73304	73308	73309	73309	she	85	" O God , "
73312	73495	73309	73309	she	85	" full well I know that to lie concerning holy things doth damn the soul forever . But the great Lord Bishop said she would thrust happiness from her with both hands , unless our Lady vouchsafed a vision . Gladly will I bear the endless torments of hell fires , that she may know fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore . But , oh , Son of Mary , by the sorrows of our Lady 's heart , by the yearnings of her love , I ask that once a year I may come out to sit just for one hour on my jasper seat , and see the Reverend Mother walk , between the great Lord Bishop and the splendid Knight , up the wide golden stair . And some day at last , O Saviour Christ , I ask it of Thy wounds , ' Thy dying love , Thy broken heart , may the sin of Mary Antony her great sin , her sin of thus lying about holy things be forgiven her , because because she loved "
74129	74162	74109	74109	she	373	" I thank Thee , O Father , Lord of Heaven and earth , that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . "
74723	74741	74712	74712	her	4297	" Take her . She hath been ever thine . I have but kept her for thee . "
74814	74858	74807	74807	she	373	" A sign , a sign ! Thy will was hid from me ; yet I accept its revelation through this babe . But I ask a sign which shall speak to mine own heart , also ! A sign , a sign ! "
74950	75084	74942	74942	Florence	202	" in his early life , when appointed to be chanter and treasurer of the Church , Wulstan embraced the opportunity of serving God with less restraint , giving himself up to a contemplative life , going into the church day and night to pray and read the Bible . So devoted was he to sacred vigils that not only would he keep himself awake during the night , but day and night also ; and when the urgency of nature at last compelled him to sleep , he did not pamper his limbs by resting on a bed or coverings , but would lie down for a short time on one of the benches of the Church , resting his head on the book which he had used for praying or reading . "
75137	75163	75130	75135	this greatly revered Bishop of Worcester	2092	" a man of great piety and dovelike simplicity , one beloved of God , and of the people whom he ruled in all things , "
75276	75297	75272	75272	her	373	" A sign , a sign ! However slight , however small ; a sign mine own heart can understand . "
75492	75500	75501	75501	she	91	" If he fly around the chamber , "
75504	75533	75501	75501	she	91	" my place is here . But if he fly straight out into the open , then doth our blessed Lady bid me also to arise and go . "
76126	76134	76121	76122	the Knight	764	" I keep my trust in prayer , "
76467	76514	76519	76520	the monks	4870	" I keep my trust in prayer . . . . Give her to me ! Give her to me ! Blessed Virgin , give her to me ! ' A sculptured smile ' ? Nay , my lord . I keep my trust in prayer ! "
76574	76631	76558	76558	he	764	" When a thrush calls , you will leave the crypt , and guard the entrance from without ; allowing none , on any pretext , to pass within . When a blackbird whistles you will return , lift the stretcher , and pass with it , as heretofore , from the Cathedral to the hostel . "
76650	76653	76654	76654	he	764	" Martin , "
76673	76795	76654	76654	he	764	" All is well . Our pilgrimage is about to end , as we have hoped , in a great recovery and restoration . When the call of a curlew sounds , leap from the stretcher , leave the bandages beside it ; go to the entrance , guarding it from within ; but turn not thy head this way , until a blackbird whistles ; upon which lose thyself among the pillars , letting no man see thee , until we have passed out . After which , make thy way out , as best thou canst , and join me at the hostel , entering by the garden and window , without letting thyself be seen in the courtyard . "
78271	78273	78261	78262	the Prioress	373	" yea "
78275	78278	78261	78262	the Prioress	373	" nay . "
78323	78329	78330	78330	he	764	" Lay thyself down thereon , "
78333	78357	78330	78330	he	764	" I grieve to ask it of thee , Mora ; but there is no other way of taking thee hence , unobserved . "
78473	78477	78479	78480	the Knight	764	" Lie down , "
78753	78767	78736	78736	he	132	" Our Lady be with thee . It will not be for long . "
78872	78882	78883	78883	he	4673	" Precede me to the Palace , Father Benedict , "
78886	78904	78883	78883	he	4673	" I wish to have speech with yonder Knight who , I think , comes this way . "
79047	79057	79059	79060	the Bishop	4673	" Good - day to you , Sir Hugh , "
79062	79080	79059	79060	the Bishop	4673	" Hath your pilgrimage to the shrine of the blessed Saint Oswald worked the recovery you hoped ? "
79081	79087	79089	79090	the Knight	764	" Aye , my lord , "
79092	79109	79089	79090	the Knight	764	" a great recovery and restoration . We start for Warwick in an hour 's time . "
79110	79113	79115	79116	the Bishop	4673	" Wonderful ! "
79118	79159	79115	79116	the Bishop	4673	" Our Lady and the holy Saint be praised ! But you are wise to keep the patient well covered . However complete the restoration , great care is required at first , and over - exertion must be avoided . "
79160	79170	79172	79173	the Knight	764	" Your blessing for the patient , Reverend Father , "
79196	79202	79203	79203	he	4673	" Benedictio Domini sit vobiscum , "
79214	79231	79203	79203	he	4673	" Be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed . . . . Go in peace . "
79489	79494	79495	79495	he	4673	" Saddle me Shulamite , "
79498	79527	79495	79495	he	4673	" Also mount Jasper on our fastest nag , with saddle - bags . We ride to Warwick ; and must start within a quarter of an hour . "
79557	79560	79561	79561	he	4673	" Philip , "
79564	79716	79561	79561	he	4673	" a very noble lady , betrothed to Sir Hugh d'Argent , has just arrived at the Star hostel , where for some days he has awaited her . She rides with the Knight forthwith to Warwick , where they will join me at the Castle . It is my wish to lend Iconoklastes to the lady . Therefore I desire thee to saddle the palfrey precisely as he was saddled when he went to the Convent of the White Ladies for their pleasuring and play . Lead him , without delay , to the hostel ; deliver him over to the men - at - arms of Sir Hugh d'Argent , and see that they hand this letter at once to the Knight , that he may give it to his lady . Lose not a moment , my good Philip . Look to see me return to - morrow . "
79983	79989	79977	79977	she	427	" Ah , dear Antony ! "
80003	80009	80010	80010	she	427	" Come hither , Antony , "
80043	80053	80058	80058	she	427	" Now I must go . The nuns wait . "
80069	80077	80078	80078	she	427	" Good - bye , my Antony , "
80081	80109	80058	80058	she	427	" Thy love and devotion have been very precious to me . The Presence of the Lord abide with thee in blessing , while we are gone . "
80419	80431	80415	80415	her	85	" The Presence of the Lord abide with thee in blessing . "
80474	80480	80468	80469	Mary Antony	85	" While we are gone . "
80692	80701	80702	80702	she	2309	" Sister Mary Rebecca leads to - day , "
80709	80720	80702	80702	she	2309	" and all the way hath stepped upon my heels . "
80818	80837	80807	80808	Sister Abigail	99	" What wait you for , Sister Antony ? The holy Ladies have by now entered their cells . "
80891	80956	80883	80884	Mary Antony	85	" Be off , thou impudent hussy ! Hold thy noisy tongue and hang thy rattling lantern on a nail ; or , better still , hold thy lantern , and hang thyself , holding it , upon the nail . If I am piously minded to pray here until sunset , that is no concern of thine . Be off , I say ! "
81119	81140	81106	81106	She	85	" Oh , Reverend Mother ! Twenty - five holy Ladies went to Vespers , and but twenty - four have "
81209	81233	81199	81199	It	2324	" Good - bye , my Antony . The Presence of the Lord abide with thee in blessing , while we are gone . "
81334	81338	81339	81339	she	85	" Blessed Virgin , "
81347	81361	81339	81339	she	85	" be pleased to sharpen once again the wits of old Mary Antony . "
81433	81440	81441	81441	she	85	" Prepare you the evening meal , "
81447	81557	81441	81441	she	85	" I care not what the holy Ladies feed upon this even , nor how badly it be served . Reverend Mother again elects to spend the night in prayer and fasting . So Mother Sub - Prioress will spit out a curse upon the viands ; or Sister Mary Rebecca will miaul over them like an old cat that sees a tom in every shadow , though all toms have long since fled at her approach . Serve at the usual hour ; and let Abigail ring the Refectory bell . I am otherwise employed . And remember . Reverend Mother is on no account to be disturbed . "
81585	81592	81593	81593	she	4960	" Beshrew me , Sister Antony ! "
81596	81598	81593	81593	she	4960	" Wherefore "
81599	81602	81604	81605	Mary Antony	85	" Whist ! "
81607	81890	81604	81605	Mary Antony	85	" Speak not so loud . Now listen , Mary Mark . Saw you the great Lord Bishop yesterday , a - walking with Mary Antony ? Ha , ha ! Yea , verily ! ' Worthy Mother , ' his lordship called me . ' Worthy Mother , ' with his hand upon his heart . And into the gardens he walked with Mary Antony . Wherefore , you ask ? Wherefore should the great Lord Bishop walk in the Convent garden with an old lay - sister , who ceased to be a comely wench more than half a century ago ? Because , Sister Mark , if you needs must know , the Lord Bishop is full of anxious fears for the Reverend Mother , and knoweth that Mary Antony , old though she be , is able to tend and watch over her . The Lord Bishop and the Worthy Mother both fear that the Reverend Mother fasts too often , and spends too many hours in vigil . The Reverend Father has therefore deputed the Worthy Mother to watch in this matter , and to let him know at once if the Reverend Mother imperils her health again , by too lengthy a fast or vigil . And , lo ! this very day , the Reverend Mother purposes not coming to the evening meal , and intends spending the whole night in prayer and vigil , before our Lady 's shrine . Therefore the Worthy Mother I , myself must start at once to fetch the great Lord Bishop ; and you , Sister Mary Mark , must open the gate and let me be gone . "
81901	81952	81891	81892	The porteress	4960	" Nay , Sister Mary Antony , that can I not , without an order from the Reverend Mother herself . And even then , you could not walk so far as to the Lord Bishop 's Palace . I doubt if you would even reach the Fore - gate . "
81953	81961	81963	81964	Mary Antony	85	" That I should , and shall ! "
81966	82014	81963	81964	Mary Antony	85	" And , if my old legs fail me , many a gallant will dismount and offer me his horse . Thus in fine style shall I ride into Worcester city . Didst thou not see me bestride the Lord Bishop 's white palfrey on Play Day ? "
82022	82025	82026	82026	she	85	" Aye , "
82029	82054	82026	82026	she	85	" my sides have but lately ceased aching . I pray you , Sister Antony , call not that sight again into my mind . "
82055	82069	81891	81892	The porteress	4960	" Then open the door , Mary Mark , and let me go . "
82070	82079	82026	82026	she	85	" Nay , that I dare not do . "
82080	82119	81891	81892	The porteress	4960	" Then , if I fail to do as bidden by the great Lord Bishop , I shall tell his lordship that thou , and thine obstinacy , stood in the way of the fulfilment of my purpose . "
82124	82136	82120	82121	The porteress	4960	" Bring me leave from the Reverend Mother , Sister Antony . "
82137	82145	82147	82148	Mary Antony	85	" Nay , that can I not , "
82150	82190	82147	82148	Mary Antony	85	" as any fool might see , when I go without the Reverend Mother 's knowledge to report to the Lord Bishop by his private command . Even the Reverend Mother herself obeys the commands of the Lord Bishop . "
82238	82245	82247	82248	Sister Antony	85	" See here , Mary Mark , "
82250	82340	82247	82248	Sister Antony	85	" I must send a message forthwith to Mother Sub - Prioress . You shall take it , leaving me in charge of the gate , as often I am left , by order of the Reverend Mother , when you are bidden elsewhere . If , on your return and you need not to hurry you find me gone , none can blame you . Yet when the Lord Bishop rides in at sunset , he will give you his blessing and , like enough , something besides . "
82347	82357	82358	82358	she	2340	" I will take your message , Sister Antony , "
82362	82431	82479	82479	she	2340	" Go , by way of the kitchens and the Refectory stairs , to the cell of Mother Sub - Prioress . Say that the Reverend Mother purposes passing the night in prayer and vigil , will not come to the evening meal , and desires Mother Sub - Prioress to take her place . Also that for no cause whatever is the Reverend Mother to be disturbed . "
82860	82865	82866	82866	she	2361	" Good my lord , "
82876	82885	82866	82866	she	2361	" comes Sir Hugh d'Argent hither this night ? "
82886	82889	82891	82892	the Bishop	4673	" Aye , "
82904	82914	82891	82892	the Bishop	4673	" Within two hours , he should be here . "
82915	82923	82925	82926	Mistress Deborah	209	" Comes he alone , my lord ? "
82928	82931	82933	82934	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
82936	82958	82933	82934	the Bishop	4673	" the Countess of Norelle , a very noble lady to whom the Knight is betrothed , rides hither with him . "
82959	82965	82967	82969	the old woman	430	" The saints be praised ! "
83211	83224	83228	83231	the black mare Shulamite	2384	" A corpse for a bride ! A corpse for a bride ! "
83241	83253	83228	83231	the black mare Shulamite	2384	" Alas , poor Knight ! A corpse for a bride ! "
83769	83774	83808	83808	Mora	144	" The captive exile hasteneth "
83907	83910	83911	83911	she	2425	" You ? "
83914	83928	83911	83911	she	2425	" You ! The priest who is to we d us ? You ! "
83938	83943	83944	83944	he	154	" Yes , I , "
83947	83949	83944	83944	he	154	" I. "
83960	83963	83964	83964	she	2425	" No , "
83972	83987	83988	83988	She	2425	" I dream . It is not Father Gervaise . It is the Bishop . "
84093	84097	84098	84098	she	2425	" Reverend Father , "
84101	84118	84119	84119	She	2425	" I have chosen , even as you prayed I might do , the harder part . "
84140	84154	84131	84131	her	2425	" For Christ 's sake , my Lord Bishop , pray for me ! "
84177	84186	84187	84187	he	154	" You have chosen rightly , my child , "
84190	84220	84187	84187	he	154	" we will pray that grace and strength may be vouchsafed you , so that you may continue , without faltering , along the pathway of this fresh vocation . "
84263	84267	84268	84268	she	2425	" Reverend Father , "
84284	84306	84268	84268	she	2425	" I pray you , tell me what you bid penitents to remember as they kneel in prayer before the crucifix ? "
84345	84369	84327	84327	His	4673	" I tell them , my daughter , to remember , the sacred Wounds that bled and the Heart that broke for them . "
84384	84390	84391	84391	she	2425	" The Heart that broke ? "
84394	84402	84403	84403	she	2425	" That broke ? Do hearts break ? "
84406	84416	84403	84403	she	2425	" Nay , rather , they turn to stone . "
84453	84458	84459	84459	he	132	" My Lord Bishop , "
84462	84517	84459	84459	he	132	" you have been too good to us . I sent Mora on alone that she might find you here , not telling her who was the prelate who had so graciously offered to we d us , knowing how much it would mean to her that it should be you , Reverend Father . "
84518	84530	84532	84533	the Bishop	4673	" Gladly am I here for that purpose , my son , "
84535	84569	84532	84533	the Bishop	4673	" having as you know , the leave and sanction of His Holiness for so doing . Shall we proceed at once to the chapel , or do you plan first to sup ? "
84570	84575	84577	84578	the Knight	764	" Nay , Father , "
84580	84623	84577	84578	the Knight	764	" My betrothed has ridden far and needs food first , and then a good night 's rest . If it will not too much delay your return to Worcester , I would pray you to we d us in the morning . "
84763	84771	84772	84772	he	4673	" It is well planned , Hugh , "
84775	84783	84772	84772	he	4673	" I am here until the morning . "
84841	84844	84845	84845	she	144	" Debbie ! "
84848	84858	84845	84845	she	144	" Oh , Debbie ! Let us go home ! "
84897	84903	84905	84905	Deborah	209	" There , my pretty ! "
84916	84959	84905	84905	Deborah	209	" There , there ! We are at home , now we are together . Come and see the chamber in which we shall sleep , just as we slept long years ago , when you were a babe , my dear . "

85046	85060	85061	85061	he	4673	" There were two of us the other night , my dear lord , "
85064	85077	85061	85061	he	4673	" but now old Debbie has appeared , methinks there are three ! "
85902	85945	85891	85891	his	4673	" You are up betimes , my daughter , as I guessed you would be ; also you have come hither , as I hoped you might do . Am I the first to wish you joy , on this glad day ? "
85946	85950	85951	85951	she	144	" The first , "
85954	86000	85951	85951	she	144	" Even my good Deborah slept through my rising . I woke at the accustomed hour , to ring the Convent bell , and found myself Prioress no longer , but bride an earthly bride expected to deck herself with jewels for an earthly bridal . "
86001	86025	86035	86035	his	4673	" ' Even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price , ' "
86038	86052	86035	86035	his	4673	" Alas , my lord , I fear that ornament was never mine . "
86053	86076	86035	86035	his	4673	" Yet you must wear it now , my daughter . I have heard it is an ornament greatly admired by husbands . "
86105	86112	86113	86113	she	2482	" Your blessing , Reverend Father , "
86126	86140	86123	86123	her	2482	" Oh , I entreat your blessing , on this my bridal day ! "
86229	86235	86237	86237	Symon	154	" Come , my daughter , "
86243	86265	86237	86237	Symon	154	" We of the Church , who know the value of these early hours , let us break our fast together . "
86266	86274	86275	86275	she	2482	" Is it magic , my lord ? "
86284	86287	86289	86290	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
86292	86320	86289	86290	the Bishop	4673	" but I was out a full hour ago . And the dairy wench was up before me . So between us we contrived this simple repast . "
86427	86519	86419	86419	his	4673	" And now , my daughter , will you tell me how it has come to pass that you have been led to feel it right to take this irrevocable step , renouncing your vows , and keeping your troth to Hugh ? When last we spoke together you declared that naught would suffice but a clear sign , vouchsafed you from our Lady herself , making it plain that your highest duty was to Hugh , and that Heaven absolved you from your vows . Was such a sign vouchsafed ? "
86520	86585	86419	86419	his	4673	" Indeed it was , my lord , in wondrous fashion , our Lady choosing as the mouthpiece of her will , by means of a most explicit and unmistakable revelation , one so humble and so simple , that I could but exclaim : ' Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . ' "
86586	86590	86592	86593	the Bishop	4673	" And who , "
86608	86618	86601	86601	he	4673	" who , my daughter , was the babe ? "
86619	86629	86419	86419	his	4673	" The old lay - sister , Mary Antony . "
86630	86633	86635	86636	the Bishop	4673	" Ah , "
86638	86666	86635	86636	the Bishop	4673	" an ancient babe . Yet truly , a most worthy babe . Almost , I should be inclined to say , a wise and prudent babe . "
86667	86674	86676	86676	Mora	144	" Nay , my Lord Bishop , "
86713	86748	86701	86701	he	4673	" you and I were the wise and prudent , arguing for and against , according to our own theories and reason . But to this babe , our Lady vouchsafed a clear vision . "
86749	86755	86757	86758	the Bishop	4673	" Tell me of it , "
86881	86899	86860	86861	our Lady	4260	" Take her ; she hath been ever thine . I have but kept her for thee . "
86900	86910	86912	86912	Mora	144	" What say you to that , Reverend Father ? "
86916	86924	86926	86927	the Bishop	4673	" I scarce know what to say , "
86929	86954	86926	86927	the Bishop	4673	" For lack of anything better , I fall back upon my favourite motto , and I say : ' Love never faileth . ' "
87028	87040	87041	87041	she	144	" It has naught to do with love , my lord , "
87047	87059	87041	87041	she	144	" unless you mean the divine lovingkindness of our blessed Lady . "
87060	87063	87065	87066	the Bishop	4673	" Precisely , "
87085	87096	87071	87071	his	4673	" The divine lovingkindness of our blessed Lady never faileth . "
87097	87116	87065	87066	the Bishop	4673	" You agree , my lord , that the vision shed a clear light upon all my perplexities ? "
87117	87121	87123	87124	the Bishop	4673	" Absolutely clear , "
87126	87211	87123	87124	the Bishop	4673	" The love which arranged the vision saw to that . Revelations , my daughter , are useless unless they are explicit . Had our Lady merely waved her marble hand , instead of stooping to take yours and place it in that of the Knight , you might have thought she was waving him away , and bidding you to remain . If her marble hand moved at all , it is well that it moved in so definite and practical a manner . "
87212	87221	87223	87223	Mora	144	" It seems to me , Reverend Father , "
87246	87265	87230	87230	her	144	" it almost seems to me that you regard the entire vision with a measure of secret incredulity . "
87266	87409	87123	87124	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , my daughter , there you mistake . On the contrary I am fully convinced , by that which you tell me , that the ancient babe , Mary Antony , was undoubtedly permitted to see you and your knightly lover kneeling hand in hand before our Lady 's shrine ; also I praise our blessed Lady that by vouchsafing this sight to Mary Antony , and by allowing her to hear words which you yourself know to have been in very deed actually spoken , your mind has been led to accept as the divine will for you , this return to the world and union with your lover , which will , I feel sure , be not only for your happiness and his , but also a fruitful source of good to many . Yet , I admit "
87442	87486	87434	87434	he	4673	" Yet , I frankly admit , I would sooner for mine own guidance listen for the Voice of God within , or learn His will from the written Word , than ask for miraculous signs , or act upon the visions of others .
87487	87648	87434	87434	he	4673	" No doubt you read , in the Chronicle I lately lent you , how ' in the year of our Lord eleven hundred and thirty - seven that time of many sorrows , of burning , pillaging , rapine and torture , when the city of York was burned together with the principal monastery ; the city of Rochester was consumed ; also the Church of Bath , and the city of Leicester ; when owing to the absence of King Stephen abroad and the mildness of his rule when at home , the barons greatly oppressed and ill - used the Church and the people while many were standing at the Celebration of Mass at Windsor , they beheld the Crucifix , which was over the altar , moving and wringing its hands , now the right hand with the left , now the left with the right , after the manner of those who are in distress . '
87649	87671	87434	87434	he	4673	" This wondrous sight convinced those who saw it that the crucified Redeemer sympathised with the grievous sorrows of the land . "
87728	87728	87716	87716	He	2515	"
87734	87847	87716	87716	He	2515	" I think I understand , my lord ; and that you should so feel , helps me to confess to you a thing which I have scarce dared admit to myself . I found it difficult in mine own soul to attach due weight to our blessed Lady 's words as heard by Mary Antony . Mine own test the robin 's flight , straight from the hand of the Madonna to the world without spoke with more sense of truth to my heart . I blame myself for this ; but so it is . Yet it was the vision which decided me as to my clear path of duty . "
87848	87851	87853	87854	the Bishop	4673	" Doubtless , "
87856	87892	87853	87854	the Bishop	4673	" the medium of Mary Antony took from the solemnity of the pronouncement . There would be a twist of quaintness in even the holiest vision , as described by the old lay - sister . "
87893	87899	87901	87901	Mora	144	" Nay , my lord , "
87903	87979	87901	87901	Mora	144	" Truth to tell , it was not so . Once fairly started on the telling , she seemed lifted into a strange sublimity of utterance . I marvelled at it , and at the unearthly radiance of her face . At the end , I thought she slept ; but later I heard from the Sub - Prioress that she was found swooning before the crucifix and they had much ado to bring her round .
87980	88032	87853	87854	the Bishop	4673	" My lord , my heart fails me when I think to - day of my empty cell , and of the sore perplexity of my nuns . How soon will it be possible that you see them and put the matter right , by giving the Holy Father 's message ? "
88033	88067	87901	87901	Mora	144	" So soon as you are we d , my daughter , I ride back to Worcester . I shall endeavour to reach the Convent before the hour when they leave for Vespers . "
88068	88150	87853	87854	the Bishop	4673	" May I beg , my lord , that you speak a word of especial kindness to old Antony , whose heart will be sore at my departure ? I had thought to bid her be silent concerning the vision ; but as she declares the shining Knight was Saint George or Saint Michael , the nuns , in their devout simplicity , will doubtless hold the vision to have been merely symbolic of my removal to ' higher service . ' "
88151	88158	88160	88161	the Bishop	4673	" I will seek old Antony , "
88163	88170	88160	88161	the Bishop	4673	" and speak with her alone . "
88171	88174	88176	88176	Mora	144	" Father , "
88182	88310	88176	88176	Mora	144	" during all these years , you have been most good to me ; kind beyond words ; patient always . I fear I ofttimes tried you by being too firmly set on my own will and way . But , I pray you to believe , I ever valued your counsel and could scarce have lived without your friendship . Last night , on first entering the Castle , I fear I spoke wildly and acted strangely . I was sore overwrought . I came in , out of the night , not knowing whom I should find in the hall chamber ; and for a moment , my lord , for one wild , foolish moment I took you not for yourself but for another . "
88311	88322	88324	88325	the Bishop	4673	" For whom did you take me , my daughter ? "
88327	88392	88393	88394	The Bishop	4673	" For one of whom you have oft reminded me , my lord , if I may say so without offence , seeing I speak of a priest who was the ideal of my girlhood 's dreams . Knew you , many years ago , one Father Gervaise , held in high regard at the Court , confessor to the Queen and her ladies ? "
88412	88416	88417	88417	he	4673	" Father Gervaise ? "
88420	88450	88417	88417	he	4673	" Preacher at the Court ? Indeed , I knew him , my daughter ; and more than knew him . Father Gervaise and I had the same grandparents . "
88451	88454	88456	88456	Mora	144	" Ah , "
88460	88551	88456	88456	Mora	144	" then that accounts for a resemblance which from the first has haunted me , making of our friendship , at once , so sweetly intimate a thing . The voice and the eyes alone were like but , ah , so like ! Father Gervaise wore a beard , which hid his mouth and chin ; but his blue eyes had in them that kindly yet searching look , though not merry as yours oft are , my lord ; and your voice has ever made me think of his .
88552	88695	88786	88787	The Bishop	4673	" And once just once his eyes looked at me , across the Castle hall at Windsor , with a deep glow of fire in them ; a look which made me feel called to an altar whereon , if I could but stand the test of fire , I should be forever purified , uplifted , blest as was never earthly maid before , save only our blessed Lady . All that night I dreamed of it , and my whole soul was filled with it , yet never again did I see Father Gervaise . The next morning he left the Court , and soon after sailed for Spain ; and on the passage thither the ship foundered in a great storm , and he , with all on board , perished . Heard you of that , my lord ? "
88696	88701	88703	88704	the Bishop	4673	" I heard it , "
88706	88785	88703	88704	the Bishop	4673	" All believed it , and mourned him ; for by all he was beloved . But never could I feel that he was dead . Always for me it seemed that he still lived . And last night when I entered across the great hall chamber , it seemed as if , once more , the eyes of Father Gervaise looked upon me , with that glowing fire in them , which called me to an altar . "
88801	88867	88795	88795	his	4673	" You were over - strained , my daughter . When you drew near , you found instead of a ghostly priest with eyes of fire , drowned many years ago , off the coast of Spain your old friend , Symon of Worcester , who had stolen a march on you , by reason of the swift paces of his good mare , Shulamite . "
88879	88886	88887	88887	she	144	" Mock not , my friend , "
88890	89047	88887	88887	she	144	" There was a time when Father Gervaise stood to me for all my heart held dearest . Yet I loved him , not as a girl loves a man , but rather as a nun loves her Lord . He stood to me for all that was noblest and best ; and , above all , for all that was vital and alive in life and in religion ; strong to act ; able to endure . He confessed me once , and told me , when I kneeled before the crucifix , to say of Him Who hangs thereon : ' He ever liveth to make intercession for us . ' Never have I forgotten it . And sometimes when I say the sacred words , and , saying them , my mind turns to Father Gervaise , an echo seems to whisper to my spirit : ' He , also , liveth . ' "
89053	89057	89058	89058	he	154	" My daughter , "
89061	89140	89058	89058	he	154	" the sun is high in the heavens . We must not linger here . Hugh will be seeking his bride , and Mistress Deborah be waxing anxious over the escape of her charge . The morning meal will be ready in the banqueting hall ; after which we must to the chapel , for the marriage . Then , without delay , I ride to Worcester to make all right at the Nunnery . Let us go . "
89151	89154	89155	89155	she	144	" Father , "
89158	89177	89155	89155	she	144	" think you the heart of a nun can ever become again as the heart of other women ? "
89967	89976	89978	89979	the Bishop	4673	" I did well to pass into exile , "
90239	90253	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" Hath any message arrived at the Palace from the Convent , Philip ? "
90258	90264	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" None , my lord . "
90265	90271	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" Or at the Priory ? "
90272	90290	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , my lord . But I did hear , at the Priory , a strange rumour "
90291	90303	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" Rumours are rarely worth regarding or repeating , Brother Philip . "
90304	90320	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" True , my lord . Yet having so lately aided her to ride upon Icon "
90321	90345	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" ' Her ' ? With whom then is rumour making free ? And what saith this Priory rumour concerning ' her ' ? "
90346	90363	90255	90256	the Bishop	4673	" They say the old lay - sister , Mary Antony , hath fled the Convent . "
90364	90368	90370	90371	the Bishop	4673	" Mary Antony ! "
90389	90411	90374	90374	his	4673	" But , in heaven 's name , good brother , wherefore should the old lay - sister leave the Convent ? "
90412	90439	90374	90374	his	4673	" They say she was making her way into the city in search of you , my lord ; but she hath not reached the Palace . "
90440	90447	90374	90374	his	4673	" Any other rumour , Philip ? "
90448	90501	90374	90374	his	4673	" Nay , my lord , none ; save that the Prioress is distraught with anxiety concerning the aged nun , and has commanded that the underground way to the Cathedral crypt be searched ; though , indeed , the porteress confesses to having let Sister Mary Antony out at the gate . "
90502	90506	90508	90509	the Bishop	4673	" Rumour again , "
90511	90572	90508	90509	the Bishop	4673	" and not a word of truth in it , I warrant . Deny it , right and left , my good Philip ; and say , on my authority , that the Reverend Mother hath most certainly not caused the crypt way to be searched . I would I could lay hands on the originator of these foolish tales . "
90636	90643	90644	90644	he	4673	" Lead her home , Philip , "
90647	90688	90644	90644	he	4673	" and surround her with tenderest care . Her brave heart hath done wonders this day . It is for us to see that her body doth not pay the penalty . Here ! Take her rein , and go . "
90925	90931	90932	90932	he	4673	" I have lost her ! "
90935	90972	90932	90932	he	4673	" Holy Jesu Thou Whose heart did break after three hours of darkness and of God - forsaken loneliness have pity ! The light of my life is gone from me , yet must I live . "
91055	91082	91033	91033	her	2587	" He stood to me for all that was vital and alive , in life and in religion ; strong to act ; able to endure . "
91162	91166	91209	91212	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" little vain man "
91508	91511	91513	91514	the Bishop	4673	" Benedicite , "
91520	91533	91513	91514	the Bishop	4673	" I am fortunate in chancing to find the whole community assembled . "
91576	91644	91569	91569	she	91	" My Lord Bishop , you find us in much distress . The Reverend Mother is locked into her cell , and we fear that , after a long night of vigil and fasting , she hath swooned . We can not get an answer by much knocking , and we have no means of forcing the door , which is of most massive strength and thickness . "
91731	91755	91718	91718	his	4673	" And why do you make so sure , Mother Sub - Prioress , that the Reverend Mother is indeed within her cell ? "
91756	91764	91774	91774	she	91	" Because we know her to be , "
91783	91801	91774	91774	she	91	" Permit me , Reverend Father , to recount to you the happenings of the last twenty hours .
91802	91901	91902	91905	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" Soon after her return from Vespers , yestereven , the Reverend Mother sent word by Mary Antony that she purposed again spending the night in prayer and vigil , and would not be present at the evening meal ; also that she must not , on any account whatever , be disturbed . Mary Antony took this message to the kitchens , bidding the younger lay - sisters to prepare the meal without her , saying she cared not how badly it was served , seeing the Reverend Mother would not be there to partake of it . "
91999	92004	92006	92009	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" The old creature , "
92019	92096	92006	92009	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" then betook herself to the outer gates , told the porteress that she had your orders , Reverend Father , to report to you if the Reverend Mother again elected to pass a night in vigil and in fasting , because you and she you and she forsooth ! were made anxious by the too constant fasting and the too prolonged vigils of the Reverend Mother . Mary Mark very properly refused to allow the old "
92097	92102	92104	92105	the Bishop	4673	" Lay - sister , "
92119	92221	92109	92112	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" the old lay - sister to leave the Convent . Whereupon Sister Antony sent Mary Mark to deliver the Reverend Mother 's message to me , bribing her , with the promise of a gift from you , my lord , to leave her the key . When the porteress returned , Mary Antony was gone , having left the great doors ajar , and the key within the lock . She has not been seen since . Did she reach the Palace , and speak with you , my lord ? Is she now in safety at the Palace ? "
92222	92225	92227	92228	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
92231	92243	92227	92228	the Bishop	4673	" Sister Mary Antony hath not been seen at the Palace . "
92244	92251	92253	92254	Sister Abigail	99	" Alack - a - day ! "
92283	92283	92268	92268	She	2623	"
92284	92289	92291	92294	the Sub - Prioress	419	" Peace , girl ! "
92296	92315	92291	92294	the Sub - Prioress	419	" Thy comments and thy wailings mend not the matter , and do but incense the Lord Bishop . "
92380	92391	92392	92392	he	4673	" Proceed with your recital , Mother Sub - Prioress , "
92395	92415	92392	92392	he	4673	" You have as yet given me no proof confirming your belief that the Prioress is within the cell . "
92416	92429	92431	92434	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" When the absence of Mary Antony became known , my lord , "
92436	92663	92431	92434	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" we felt it right to acquaint the Reverend Mother with the old lay - sister 's flight . I , myself , knocked upon this door ; but the only reply I received was the continuous low chanting of prayers , from within ; not so much a clear chanting , as a murmur ; and whenever , during the night , nuns listened at the door , or ventured again to tap , the sound of the Reverend Mother 's voice , reciting psalms or prayers , reached them . As you may remember , my lord , the ground upon the other side of the building is on a lower level than the cloister lawn . The windows of the Reverend Mother 's cell are therefore raised above the shrubbery and it is not possible to see into the chamber . But Sister Mary Rebecca , who went round after dark , noted that the Reverend Mother had lighted her tapers and drawn her curtains . This morning the light is extinguished , the curtains are drawn back , and the casement flung open . Moreover at the usual hour for rising , the Reverend Mother rang the bell , as is her custom , to waken the nuns rang it from within her cell , by means of this rope and pulley . "
92664	92667	92669	92670	the Bishop	4673	" Ah , "
92672	92790	92431	92434	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" Sister Abigail , up already , thereupon ran to the Reverend Mother 's cell ; and , the bell still swinging , tapped and asked if she might bring in milk and bread . Once more the only answer was the low chanting of prayers . Also , Sister Abigail declares , the voice was so weak and faltering , she scarce knew it for the Reverend Mother 's . And since then , my lord , there has been silence within the cell , and a sore sense of fear within our hearts ; for it is unlike the Reverend Mother to keep her door locked , when the entire community calls and knocks without . "
92797	92809	92811	92811	he	4673	" In that speak you truly , Mother Sub - Prioress , "
92813	92832	92811	92811	he	4673	" Also I must tell you without further delay , that the Prioress is not within her cell . "
92833	92839	92841	92844	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" Not within her cell ! "
92846	92852	92811	92811	he	4673	" Not within her cell ! "
92872	92881	92883	92884	the Bishop	4673	" The Prioress left the Convent yesterday afternoon , "
92886	92982	92984	92985	the Bishop	4673	" with my knowledge and approval ; travelling at once , with a sufficient escort , to a place some distance from Worcester , where I also spent the night . I have come to bring you a message from His Holiness the Pope , sent to me direct from Rome . . . . The Holy Father bids me say that your Prioress has been moved on by me , with his full knowledge and approval , to a place where she is required for higher service . Perhaps I may also tell you , "
92998	93068	92984	92985	the Bishop	4673	" that this morning I myself performed a solemn rite , for which I held the Pope 's especial mandate , setting apart your late Prioress for this higher service . She grieved that it was not possible to bid you farewell . She sends you loving greetings , her thanks for loyalty and obedience , and prays that the blessing of the Lord may ever be with you . "
93276	93305	93271	93272	the Bishop	4673	" If the Reverend Mother be not within her cell , perhaps it will please you , my lord , to inform the Convent who is within it ! "
93306	93310	93312	93313	the Bishop	4673	" That point , "
93315	93321	93312	93313	the Bishop	4673	" can speedily be settled . "
93723	93726	93727	93727	he	4673	" Yes , "
93798	93804	93806	93809	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" Undoubtedly she is dying , "
93844	93849	93851	93852	the Bishop	4673	" I know it , "
93858	93904	93851	93852	the Bishop	4673	" Therefore am I come to confess our sister and to administer the final rites and consolations of the Church . I have with me all that is needed . You may now withdraw , and leave me to watch alone beside Sister Mary Antony . "
93905	93912	93914	93917	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" We sent for Father Peter , "
93919	93934	93914	93917	Mother Sub - Prioress	91	" but she paid no heed to any of his questions , neither would she "
93994	94005	94007	94008	the Bishop	4673	" I bid you all to go to your cells , "
94010	94068	94007	94008	the Bishop	4673	" there to spend the next hour in earnest prayer for the passing soul of this aged nun who , during so long a time , has lived and worked in this Convent . Let every door be closed . I keep the final vigil alone . When I need help I shall ring the Convent bell . "
94261	94264	94265	94265	she	85	" Reverend Father "
94358	94362	94364	94365	the Bishop	4673	" Speak low , "
94370	94424	94364	94365	the Bishop	4673	" Speak low , dear Sister Antony ; partly to spare thy strength ; and partly because , though I have sent all the White Ladies to their cells , our good Mother Sub - Prioress , in her natural anxiety for thy welfare , may be outside the door , even now . "
94429	94442	94443	94443	she	85	" If we could but thrust a nail through into her ear , "
94461	94483	94450	94450	she	85	" Did I succeed in keeping from them the flight of the Reverend Mother , until you arrived , Reverend Father ? "
94484	94498	94450	94450	she	85	" Yes , faithful heart , wise beyond all expectation , you did . "
94504	94510	94511	94511	she	85	" I locked them out , "
94519	94749	94511	94511	she	85	" but I also took them in . Yea , verily , I took them in ! Scores of times they called me ' Reverend Mother . ' ' Open the door , I humbly pray you , Reverend Mother , ' pleaded Mother Sub - Prioress at the keyhole . ' Dixi : Custodiam vias meas , ' chanted Mary Antony , in a beauteous voice ! . . . ' Open , open , Reverend Mother ! ' besought a multitude without . ' Quid multiplicati sunt gui tribulant me ! ' intoned Mary Antony , within . . . . ' Most dear and Reverend Mother , ' crooned Sister Mary Rebecca , at midnight , ' I have something of deepest importance to say ' ' Dixit insipiens , ' was Mary Antony 's appropriate response . Eh , and Sister Mary Rebecca , thinking none could observe her , had already been round , in the moonlight , and attempted to climb a tree . All the Reverend Mother 's windows were closely curtained ; but old Antony had her eye to a crack , and the sight of Sister Mary Rebecca climbing , made all the other trees to shake with laughter , but is not a sight to be described to the great Lord Bishop . . . . Nay , then ! "
94754	94768	94817	94817	He	4673	" Why doth this knotted finger rise up and shake itself at me ? "
94833	94845	94817	94817	He	4673	" Would you have news of the Prioress , Sister Antony ? "
94852	94879	94846	94846	Instantly	221	" Is she safe , Reverend Father ? Is she well ? Hath she taken happiness to her with both hands , not thrusting it away ? "
94880	94889	94891	94892	the Bishop	4673	" Happiness hath taken her by both hands , "
94894	94915	94891	94892	the Bishop	4673	" This morning I blest her union with a noble knight to whom she was betrothed before she came hither . "
94916	94920	94922	94923	old Antony	85	" I know , "
94926	95031	94922	94923	old Antony	85	" I heard it all , I and my meat chopper , hidden in there ; I and my meat chopper not willing to let the Reverend Mother face danger alone . And I did thrust the handle of the chopper between my gums , that I might not cry ' Bravely done ! ' when the noble Knight and his men - at - arms flung a rope over a strong bough , and hanged that clerkly fellow somewhat lean and out at elbows . Oh , ah ? It was bravely done ! I heard it all ! I saw it all ! "
95049	95142	94891	94892	the Bishop	4673	" But having thus seen and heard has led me into grievous sin , Reverend Father . Alas , I have lied about holy things , sinning , I fear me , beyond forgiveness , though indeed I did it , meaning to do well . May I tell you all , Reverend Father , that you may judge whether in that which I did , I acted according to our blessed Lady 's will and intention , or whether the deceitfulness of mine own heart has led me into mortal sin ? "
95190	95203	95204	95204	he	4673	" Tell me from the beginning , without reserve , dear Antony , "
95207	95224	95204	95204	he	4673	" But speak low , for my ear only . Remember possible listeners outside the door . "
95309	95413	95667	95668	the Bishop	4673	" I lied about holy things ; I put words into our blessed Lady 's mouth ; I said she moved her hand . But you did tell me , Reverend Father , that the Reverend Mother was so made that unless there was a vision or revelation from our Lady , she would thrust away her happiness with both hands . And there would not have been a vision if old Antony had not contrived one . Yet I fear me , for the sin of that contriving , I shall never find forgiveness ; my soul must ever stay in torment . "
95428	95432	95433	95433	he	4673	" Dear Antony , "
95436	95597	95433	95433	he	4673	" Listen to me . ' Perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath torment . ' You have loved with a perfect love . You need have no fear . Trust in the love of God , in the precious blood of the Redeemer , which cleanseth from all sin , in the understanding tenderness of our Lady , who knoweth a woman 's heart . You meant to do right ; and if , honestly intending to do well , you used the wrong means , Divine love , judging you by your intention , will pardon the mistake . ' If we confess our sins , He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . ' Think no more of yourself , in this . Dwell solely on our Lord . Silence your own fears , by repeating : ' He is faithful and just . ' "
95598	95605	95607	95609	the pathetic voice	2708	" Think you , Reverend Father , "
95611	95659	95607	95609	the pathetic voice	2708	" that They will sometimes let old Antony out of hell for an hour , to sit on her jasper seat and see the Reverend Mother walk up the golden stairs , with the splendid Knight on one side and the great Lord Bishop on the other ? "
95660	95665	95667	95668	the Bishop	4673	" Sister Mary Antony , "
95674	95800	95667	95668	the Bishop	4673	" there is no place in hell for so faithful and so loving a heart . You shall go straight to your jasper seat ; and because , with the Lord , one day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day , your eyes will scarce have time to grow used to the great glory , before you see the Reverend Mother coming , walking between the two who have faithfully loved her ; and you , who have also loved her faithfully , will also mount the golden stair , and together we all shall kneel before the throne of God , and understand at last the full meaning of those words of wonder : GOD IS LOVE . "
95812	95819	95820	95820	she	2710	" Straight to my jasper seat , "
95823	95828	95820	95820	she	2710	" to watch to wait "
95936	95949	95950	95950	she	2710	" Did you we d the Reverend Mother to the splendid Knight ? "
95977	95981	95983	95984	the Bishop	4673	" This morning , "
95986	95991	95983	95984	the Bishop	4673	" I wedded them . "
95992	95998	96000	96001	old Antony	85	" Did he kiss her ? "
96025	96028	96030	96031	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
96033	96044	96030	96031	the Bishop	4673	" They who truly kiss , kiss not in public . "
96045	96048	96050	96051	Mary Antony	85	" Ah , "
96053	96065	96050	96051	Mary Antony	85	" Yea , verily ! I know that to be true . "
96247	96255	96256	96256	she	85	" Hey , thou little vain man ! "
96259	96286	96256	96256	she	85	" Ah , naughty Master Pieman ! Art come to look upon old Antony in her bed ? The great Lord Bishop will have thee hanged . "
96325	96336	96337	96337	she	85	" Ah , my little Knight of the Bloody Vest , "
96340	96358	96337	96337	she	85	" dost want thy cheese ? Wait a minute , while old Antony searches in her wallet . "
96396	96403	96404	96404	he	4673	" Fear not , dear Antony , "
96407	96412	96404	96404	he	4673	" All is well . "
96638	96652	96653	96653	he	4673	" Take this with thee to thy jasper seat , dear faithful heart , "
96656	96688	96653	96653	he	4673	" for truly it was given unto thee to perceive and know what things thou oughtest to do , and also to have grace and power faithfully to fulfil the same . "
96747	96767	96744	96744	he	4673	" And grant , O my God , that I too may be faithful , unto the very end . "
96781	96784	96780	96783	THE " SPLENDID KNIGHT	6395	" SPLENDID KNIGHT "
97333	97442	97329	97338	the ' splendid Knight " of old Antony 's vision	6396	" of old Antony 's vision ; the lover who had pursued her into her Nunnery ; wooed her in her own cell , unabashed by the dignity of her office ; mastered her will ; forced her numbed heart to awaken , disturbed by the thrill of an unwilling tenderness ; moved her to passion by the poignant anguish of a parting , which she regarded as inevitably final ; won the Bishop over , to his side , and , through him , the Pope ; and finally , by the persistence of his pleadings , moved our blessed Lady to vouchsafe a vision on his behalf .
97449	97486	97329	97338	the ' splendid Knight " of old Antony 's vision	6396	" against whom the stars in their courses had most certainly not fought . Principalities and powers had all been for him ; against him , just a woman and her conscience , and he had won .
97503	97512	97513	97513	he	2777	" Why are you not with your wife ? "
97517	97543	97513	97513	he	2777	" I am with my wife ; the only wife I have ever wanted , the only woman I shall ever we d , is here "
97586	97592	97583	97583	he	2777	" My wife is here , "
97615	97633	97602	97602	she	2775	" Even so , my lord . I am yours . Deal with me as you will . "
97954	98052	97947	97947	He	132	" of Mary Antony 's vision ! He had donned for his bridal the dress of white and silver , which he had last put on when he supped at the Palace with the Bishop . This set off , with striking effect , his dark head and the noble beauty of his countenance ; and Mora , who chiefly remembered him as a handsome youth , graceful and gay , realised for the first time his splendour as a man , and the change wrought in him by all he had faced , endured , and overcome .
98440	98447	98484	98484	his	2802	" Dead bride ! Dead bride ! "
98494	98508	98484	98484	his	2802	" Be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed . Go in peace . "
98622	98638	98615	98615	Hugh	132	" Change thy garments quickly , my beloved . There is no time to lose . "
98944	98948	98949	98949	she	2786	" Mount me , "
99247	99267	99237	99239	The stern profile	2823	" Shudder again , and I will do to thee that which shall give thee cause to shudder indeed ! "
99283	99290	99291	99291	he	133	" Yonder rides a true friend , "
99294	99304	99291	99291	he	133	" One who has learned love 's deepest lesson . "
99305	99313	99314	99314	she	144	" What is love 's deepest lesson ? "
99336	99345	99346	99346	he	133	" That true love means self - sacrifice , "
99349	99377	99346	99346	he	133	" Come , my beloved . Let us walk in the gardens , where we can talk at ease of our plans for the days to come . "
99521	99526	99527	99527	she	223	" Fair little maids , "
99530	99537	99527	99527	she	223	" and fine , dark boys , "
99712	99715	99716	99716	she	144	" Hugh , "
99719	99745	99716	99716	she	144	" very early this morning , long before you were awake , the Bishop and I broke our fast , in this arbour , together . "
99750	99755	99756	99756	he	764	" I knew that , "
99759	99894	99756	99756	he	764	" In his own characteristic way the Bishop told it me . ' My son , ' he said , ' you have reversed the sacred parable . In your case it was the bride - groom who , this morning , slumbered and slept . ' ' True , my lord , ' said I. ' But there were no foolish virgins about . ' ' Nay , verily ! ' replied the Bishop . ' The two virgins awake at that hour were pre - eminently wise : the one , making as the sun rose most golden pats of butter and crusty rolls ; the other , rising early to partake of them with appetite . Truly there were no foolish virgins about . There was but one foolish prelate . ' "
99915	99921	99922	99922	she	2840	" Wherefore said he so ? "
99927	99938	99922	99922	she	2840	" He , who is always wiser than the wisest . "
99949	99952	99953	99953	he	132	" Perhaps , "
99967	99990	99953	99953	he	132	" the Bishop 's head , being so wise , revealed to him , in himself , a certain foolishness of heart . "
99999	100005	100006	100006	she	144	" Nay then , verily ! "
100009	100029	100006	100006	she	144	" Head and heart alike are wise ; and unlike other men the Bishop 's head rules his heart . "
100030	100037	100039	100040	the Knight	764	" And a most noble heart , "
100058	100063	100117	100117	his	132	" unlike other men , "
100088	100092	100093	100093	he	132	" Tell me , "
100096	100114	100093	100093	he	132	" during all these years , has this friendship with Symon of Worcester meant much to thee ? "
100130	100325	100122	100122	She	144	" Yes , Hugh . It has done more for me than can well be told . It has kept living and growing in me much that would otherwise have been stunted or dead ; an ever fresh flow of thought , where , but for him , would have been a stagnant pool . My sad heart might have grown bitter , my nature too austere , particularly when advancement to high office brought with it an inevitable loneliness , had it not been for the interest and charm of his visits and missives ; his constant gifts and kindness . There is about him a light - hearted gaiety , a whimsical humour , a joy in life , which can not fail to wake responsive gladness in any heart with which he comes in contact . And mingled with his shrewd wisdom , his wide knowledge of men and matters , there is ever a tender charity , which thinks no evil , always believing in good and hoping for the best ; a love which never fails ; a kindness which makes one ashamed of harbouring hard or revengeful thoughts . "
100360	100363	100365	100365	Mora	144	" Also , "
100369	100443	100365	100365	Mora	144	" a very precious memory of my early days at Court , when as a young maiden I attended on the Queen , was kept alive by a remarkable likeness in the Bishop to one who was , as I learned this morning for the first time , actually near of kin to him . Do you remember , Hugh , long years ago , that I spoke to you of Father Gervaise ? "
100444	100449	100451	100452	the Knight	764	" I do remember , "
100476	100491	100454	100454	She	2845	" Father Gervaise was more to me than I then told you , Hugh . "
100492	100501	100454	100454	She	2845	" What was he to thee , Mora ? "
100502	100588	100454	100454	She	2845	" He was the Ideal of my girlhood . For a time , I thought of him by day , I dreamed of him by night . No word of his have I ever forgotten . Many of his sayings and precepts have influenced , and still deeply influence , my whole life . In fact , Hugh , I loved Father Gervaise ; not as a woman loves a man ah , no ! But , rather , as a nun loves her Lord . "
100589	100593	100595	100596	the Knight	764	" I see , "
100598	100609	100595	100596	the Knight	764	" But you were not then a nun , Mora . "
100610	100645	100454	100454	She	2845	" No , I was not then a nun . But I have been a nun since then ; and that is how I can best describe my love for the Queen 's Confessor . "
100646	100650	100652	100653	the Knight	764	" Long after , "
100655	100662	100652	100653	the Knight	764	" you were betrothed to me ? "
100663	100668	100454	100454	She	2845	" Yes , Hugh . "
100669	100678	100652	100653	the Knight	764	" How did you love me , Mora ? "
100794	100798	100799	100799	she	2851	" Dear Knight , "
100811	100829	100808	100808	her	2851	" I suppose I loved you , as a girl loves the man who has won her . "
100830	100833	100835	100835	Hugh	132	" Mora , "
100837	100845	100835	100835	Hugh	132	" I have something to tell thee . "
100846	100850	100851	100851	she	2851	" I listen , "
100854	100917	100808	100808	her	2851	" My wife so wholly , so completely , do I love thee , that I would not consciously keep anything from thee . So deeply do I love thee , that I would sooner any wrong or sin of mine were known to thee and by thee forgiven , than that thou shouldest think me one whit better than I am . "
101006	101030	101031	101031	Her	2851	" upon his conscience , which must now be told her , in this sunny arbour , on the morning of their bridal day ?
101106	101110	101111	101111	she	2851	" I listen , "
101114	101291	101094	101094	his	132	" Mora , not long ago a wondrous tale was told me of a man 's great love for thee a man , nobler than I , in that he mastered all selfish desires ; a love higher than mine , in that it put thy welfare , in all things , first . Hearing this tale , I failed both myself and thee , for I said : ' I pray heaven that , if she come to me , she may never know that she once won the love of so greatly better a man than I. ' But , since I clasped thy hand in mine , and the Bishop , laying his on either side , gave thee to be my wife , I have known there would be no peace for me if I feared to trust thee with this knowledge , because that the man who loved thee was a better man than the man who , by God 's mercy and our Lady 's grace , has won thee . "
101409	101415	101416	101416	she	412	" Dear Knight of mine , "
101419	101530	101416	101416	she	412	" no tale of a man 's love for me can have been a true one . Yet am I glad that , deeming it true , and feeling as it was your first impulse to feel , you now tell me quite frankly what you felt , thus putting from yourself all sense of wrong , while giving me the chance to say to you , that none more noble than this faithful Knight can have loved me ; for , saving a few Court pages , mostly popinjays , and Humphry of Camforth , of whom the less said the better , no other man hath loved me . "
101720	101728	101729	101729	he	764	" The tale was a true one , "
101748	101754	101755	101755	she	412	" Tell me the tale , "
101758	101767	101755	101755	she	412	" and I will pronounce upon its truth . "
101768	101937	101732	101732	She	412	" Years ago , Mora , when you were a young maiden at the Court , attending on the Queen , you were most deeply loved by one who knew he could never ask you in marriage . That being so , so noble was his nature and so unselfish his love , that he would not give himself the delight of seeing you , nor the enjoyment of your friendship , lest , being so strong a thing , his love even though unexpressed should reach and stir your heart to a response which , might hinder you from feeling free to give yourself , when a man who could offer all sought to win you . Therefore , Mora , he left the Court , he left the country . He went to foreign lands . He thought not of himself . He desired for you the full completion which comes by means of wedded love . He feared to hinder this . So he went . "
101945	101949	101950	101950	she	2868	" His name ? "
101966	101970	101972	101973	the Knight	764	" Father Gervaise , "
102018	102026	102027	102027	she	2868	" And who told you this tale , "
102030	102048	102027	102027	she	2868	" this tale of the love of Father Gervaise for a young maid , half his age ? "
102049	102061	101975	101975	He	764	" Symon of Worcester told it me , three nights ago . "
102062	102090	102027	102027	she	2868	" How came the Bishop to know so strange and so secret a thing ? And knowing it , how came he to tell it to you ? "
102091	102195	101975	101975	He	764	" He had it from Father Gervaise himself . He told it to me , because his remembrance of the sacrifice made so long ago in order that the full completion of wifehood and motherhood might be thine , had always inclined him to a wistful regret over thy choice of the monastic life , with its resultant celibacy ; leading him , from the first , to espouse and further my cause . In wedding us to - day , methinks the Bishop felt he was at last securing the consummation of the noble renunciation made so long ago by Father Gervaise . "
102234	102237	102238	102238	he	2871	" Alas ! "
102241	102272	102238	102238	he	2871	" I should not have told thee ! With my clumsy desire to keep nothing from thee , I have spoilt an hour which else might have been so perfect . "
102273	102286	102287	102287	she	2872	" You did well to tell me , dear Knight of mine , "
102311	102356	102287	102287	she	2872	" Nor is there anything in this world so perfect as the truth . If the truth opened an abyss which plunged me into hell , I would sooner know it , than attempt to enter Paradise across the flimsy fabric of a lie ! "
102388	102451	102458	102458	She	2872	" Dear Knight , had the Bishop not forestalled me when he named his palfrey , truly I might have found a fine new name for you ! But now , I pray you of your kindness , leave me alone with my fallen image for a little space , that I may gather up the fragments and give them decent burial . "
102688	102694	102702	102702	Shulamite	173	" black , but comely , "
102749	102823	102733	102734	The Rabbi	2885	" The lovely Shulamite maiden , exposed to the Eastern sun while tending her kids and keeping the vineyards , had tanned a ruddy brown , beside which the daughters of Jerusalem , enclosed in King Solomon 's scented harem , looked pale as wilting lilies . Remembering the glossy coat of the black mare , Hugh wondered , with a momentary sense of merriment , whether the Bishop supposed the maiden of the "
102827	102833	102733	102734	The Rabbi	2885	" to have been an Ethiopian .
102837	102840	102835	102835	he	764	" Iconoklastes . "
102895	102926	102889	102890	the Bishop	4673	" I named him Iconoklastes because he trampled to ruin some flower - beds on which I spent much time and care , and of which I was inordinately fond . "
103269	103278	103284	103284	his	4673	" She must be taught not to shudder , "
103288	103298	103284	103284	his	4673	" She must be given no cause to shudder , "
103382	103455	103363	103363	He	4673	" Mora , it cuts me to the heart that , in striving to be honest with you , I have all unwittingly trampled upon those flower - beds in which you long had tended fair blossoms of memory . Also I fear this knowledge of a nobler love , makes it hard for you to contemplate life linked to a love which seems to you less able for self - sacrifice . "
103469	103473	103474	103474	she	144	" Dear Knight , "
103477	103618	103474	103474	she	144	" true , I am disillusioned , but not in aught that concerns you . You trampled on no flower - beds of mine . My shattered idol is the image of one whom I , with deepest reverence , loved , as a nun might love her Guardian Angel . To learn that he loved me as a man loves a woman , and that he had to flee before that love , lest it should harm me and himself , changes the hallowed memory of years . This morning , three names stood to me for all that is highest , noblest , best : Father Gervaise , Symon of Worcester , and Hugh d'Argent . Now , the Bishop and yourself alone are left . Fail me not , Hugh , or I shall be bereft indeed . "
103635	103652	103619	103620	The Knight	764	" Then , if I failed thee , Mora , there would be but the Bishop ? "
103653	103661	103619	103620	The Knight	764	" There would be but the Bishop . "
103662	103722	103619	103620	The Knight	764	" I will not fail thee , my beloved . And I fear I must have put the matter clumsily , concerning Father Gervaise . As the Bishop told it to me , there was naught that was not noble . It seemed to me it should be sweet to the heart of a woman to be so loved . "
103723	103726	103727	103727	she	2903	" Hush , "
103732	103742	103727	103727	she	2903	" You know not the heart of a nun . "
103781	103788	103789	103789	he	764	" Time flies , dear Heart , "
103792	103802	103789	103789	he	764	" May I speak to thee of immediate plans ? "
103803	103807	103808	103808	she	2903	" I listen , "
103869	103877	103865	103865	she	2903	" I know you for a man , "
103886	103901	103865	103865	she	2903	" And a stronger man , surely , than Mary Seraphine 's Cousin Wilfred ! "
103902	103910	103912	103913	the Knight	764	" We ride on to - day , "
103915	104000	103912	103913	the Knight	764	" if you feel able for a few hours in the saddle , to the next stage in our journey . It is a hostel in the forest ; a poor kind of place , I fear ; but there is one good room where you can be made comfortable , with Mistress Deborah . I shall sleep on the hay , without , amongst my men . Some must keep guard all night . We ride through wild parts to reach our destination . "
104034	104246	104026	104026	his	764	" Mora , I am taking thee first to thine own home ; to the place where , long years ago , we loved and parted . There , all is as it was . Thy people who loved thee and had fled , have been found and brought back . Seven days of journeying should bring us there . I have sent men on before , to arrange for each night 's lodging , and make sure that all is right . Arrived at thine own castle , Mora , we shall be within three hours ' ride of mine that home to which I hope to bring thee . Until we enter there , my wife , although this morning most truly we d , we will count ourselves but betrothed . Once in thy home , it shall be left to thine own choice to come to mine when and how thou wilt . The step now taken that of leaving the Cloister and coming to me had perforce to be done quickly , if done at all . But , now it is safely accomplished , there is no further need for haste . The wings of my swift desire shall be dipt to suit thine inclination . "
104270	104457	104267	104267	he	228	" I have planned that , each day , Mistress Deborah , with the baggage and a good escort , shall go by the most direct route , and the best road . Thus thou and I will be free to ride as we will , visiting places we have known of old and which it may please thee to see again . To - day we can ride out by Kenilworth , and so on our first stage northward . Martin will take Mistress Deborah on a pillion behind him . Should she weary of travelling so , she can have a seat in the cart with the baggage . But they tell me she travels bravely on horseback . We will send them on ahead of us , and on arrival all will be in readiness for thee . If this weather holds , we shall ride each day through a world of sunshine and beauty ; and each day 's close , my wife , will find us one day nearer home . Does this please thee ? Have I thought of all ? "
104493	104551	104486	104486	Her	2908	" So perfectly have you thought and planned , dear faithful Knight , that I think our blessed Lady must have guided you . As we ride out into the sunshine , I shall grow used to the great world once more ; and you will have patience and will teach me things I have perhaps forgot . "
104573	104610	104562	104562	his	2909	" Hugh , it seems hard that I should clip your splendid wings ; but oh , Hugh ! Think you the heart of a nun can ever become again as the heart of other women ? "
104611	104615	104617	104618	the Knight	764	" Heaven forbid ! "
105207	105213	105215	105216	his friends	5582	" He is never weary , "
105218	105227	105229	105230	his acquaintances	2943	" He knoweth not the meaning of fatigue , "
105232	105254	105256	105260	those who envied his powers	2944	" There is no merit in labour which is not in anywise a burden , but , rather , a delight , "
105262	105267	105269	105270	his enemies	2945	" He is possessed , "
105272	105291	105269	105270	his enemies	2945	" by a most energetic demon ! Were that demon exorcised , the Bishop would collapse , exhausted . "
105292	105297	105299	105300	his admirers	2946	" He is filled , "
105302	105326	105299	105300	his admirers	2946	" by the Spirit of God , and is thus so energized that he can work incessantly , without experiencing ordinary human weakness . "
105375	105394	105365	105365	she	2949	" You are tired , Father . Rest there in silence , while I work at my missal . "
105444	105457	105440	105440	he	154	" How knew you that I was tired , my dear Prioress ? "
105468	105486	105463	105463	she	2949	" Because , my Lord Bishop , you twice smiled when there was no occasion for smiling . "
105508	105517	105504	105504	he	154	" My friends say I am never tired . "
105523	105538	105519	105519	she	2949	" They would speak more truly if they said that you are ever brave . "
105978	105983	105954	105955	Saint Joseph	190	" Mary , thy wife "
106337	106345	106317	106317	she	144	" So He giveth His beloved sleep . "
106664	106667	106658	106659	Sister Abigail	99	" noisy hussy "
106788	106811	106818	106818	her	85	" Let her lie ! If she choose to remain with the Dead , it is but small loss to the Living . "
107035	107043	107034	107043	those " whose strength is to sit still , "	6558	" whose strength is to sit still , "
107156	107172	107149	107149	he	4673	" Nay , Hugh . None save the old lay - sister , Mary Antony . "
107518	107525	107526	107527	the Bishop	4673	" How came she to know ? "
107796	107857	107788	107789	the Knight	764	" Nay , there you are mistaken ! I have it from the Bishop that the old lay - sister , Mary Antony , knew of it , having stayed hidden where she saw and heard much that passed ; yet being very faithful , and more than common shrewd , could so said the Bishop be most completely trusted . "
108052	108065	108046	108046	his	4673	" Request Brother Philip to come here , without loss of time . "
108090	108093	108095	108096	the Bishop	4673	" Philip , "
108237	108237	108233	108233	he	3086	"
108238	108242	108244	108245	Brother Philip	160	" My lord , "
108247	108319	108244	108245	Brother Philip	160	" the sun is setting and the daylight fades . The messenger can not now reach Warwick until long after nightfall . Would it not be safer to have all in readiness , and let him start at dawn . He would then arrive early in the day , and could speedily overtake the most worshipful Knight who , riding with his lady , will do the journey by short stages . "
108320	108323	108325	108326	the Bishop	4673	" Nay , "
108328	108356	108325	108326	the Bishop	4673	" the matter allows of no delay . Mount him so well , that he shall outdistance all dangers . He must start within half an hour . "
108393	108419	108387	108387	he	4673	" This comes to you , my son , by messenger , riding in urgent haste , because the advice herein contained is of extreme importance .
108420	108523	108387	108387	he	4673	" On no account let Mora know that which I told you here , four days since , as we paced the lawn ; namely : that the old lay - sister , Mary Antony , was aware of your visit to the Convent , and had , from some place of concealment , seen and heard much of what passed in Mora 's cell . How far you realised this , when I made mention of it , I know not . You made no comment . It mattered little , then ; but has now become a thing of extreme importance .
108524	108586	108387	108387	he	4673	" On that morning , finding the old lay - sister knew more than any supposed , and was wholly devoted to the Prioress , I had chanced to remark to her as I rode out of the courtyard that the Reverend Mother would thrust happiness from her with both hands unless our Lady herself offered it , by vision or revelation .
108587	108677	108387	108387	he	4673	" Whereupon , my dear Knight , that faithful old heart using wits she had prayed our Lady to sharpen , contrived a vision of her own devising , so wondrously contrived , so excellently devised , that Mora not dreaming of old Antony 's secret knowledge could not fail to believe it true . In fact , my son , you may praise heaven for an old woman 's wits , for , as you will doubtless some day hear from Mora herself , they gave you your wife !
108678	108712	108387	108387	he	4673	" But beware lest any chance words of yours lead Mora to suspect the genuineness of the vision . It would cost HER her peace of mind . It might cost YOU her presence .
108713	108806	108387	108387	he	4673	" Meanwhile the aged lay - sister died yesterday , after having mystified the entire Community by locking herself into the Prioress 's cell , and remaining there , from the time she found it empty when the nuns returned from Vespers , until I arrived on the following afternoon . She thus prevented any questionings concerning Mora 's flight , and averted possible scandal . But the twenty - four hours without food or drink cost the old woman her life . A faithful heart indeed , and a most shrewd wit !
108807	108836	108837	108837	I	0	" Some day , if occasion permit , I will recount to you the full story of Mary Antony 's strategy . It is well worth the hearing . "
108851	108880	108837	108837	I	0	" But we must take no risks ; and never must we forget that , in dealing with Mora , we are dealing with the heart of a nun .
108881	108906	108845	108845	hers	3095	" Therefore , my son , be wary . Heaven grant this may reach you without delay , and in time to prevent mischief . "
109636	109685	109631	109631	he	4673	" My good Philip , thou art proved right , and I , wrong . Had I been guided by thee , I should not have lost a good horse , nor which is of greater importance at this juncture twenty - four hours of most precious time . "
109720	109723	109725	109726	the Bishop	4673	" However , "
109735	109770	109725	109726	the Bishop	4673	" I must forgo the melancholy luxury of meditating upon my folly , until after we have taken prompt measures , so far as may be , to put right the mischief it has wrought .
109771	109842	109725	109726	the Bishop	4673	" This time , my good Philip , you shall be the bearer of my letter . Take with you , as escort , two of our men more , if you think needful . Ride straight from here , by the most direct route to Castle Norelle , the home of the noble Countess , lately wedded to Sir Hugh . I will make you a plan of the road .
109843	109921	109725	109726	the Bishop	4673	" If , when you reach the place , Sir Hugh and his bride have arrived , ask to have speech with the Knight alone , and put the letter into his own hands . But if they are yet on the way , ride to meet them , by a road I will clearly indicate . Only be careful to keep out of sight of all save the Knight or his body - servant , Martin Goodfellow .
109922	109957	109725	109726	the Bishop	4673	" The letter delivered , and the answer in thy hands , return , to me as speedily as may be , without overpressing men or steeds . How soon canst thou set forth ? "
109958	109966	109968	109969	Brother Philip	160	" Within the hour , my lord , "
109984	110003	109968	109969	Brother Philip	160	" with an escort of three , that we may ride by night as well as by day . "
110004	110007	110009	110010	the Bishop	4673	" Good , "
111352	111377	111349	111349	she	138	" Thou wilt come back to me , Hugh . . . . My love will ever be around thee as a silver shield . "
111397	111419	111393	111393	she	138	" Maid or wife , God knows I am all thine own . Thine , and none other 's , forever . "
111577	111582	111571	111571	his	132	" I love thee . "
112340	112359	112330	112331	old Debbie	209	" She did stretch out her hand to you , Sir Hugh , and you saw it not ! "
112370	112392	112361	112362	the Knight	764	" There is no look or gesture of hers , however slight , good Mistress Deborah , which doth escape me . "
112650	112654	112655	112655	she	138	" Blessed Virgin , "
112658	112667	112655	112655	she	138	" I thank thee for sending me home . "
112760	112763	112765	112765	Mora	144	" Home , "
112767	112778	112765	112765	Mora	144	" Blessed Virgin I thank thee for sending me home . "
112779	112782	112787	112787	her	144	" Nay , "
112789	112836	112787	112787	her	144	" I sent thee not home . I gave thee to him to whom thou didst belong . He hath brought thee home . What said the vision ? ' Take her . She is thine own . I have but kept her for thee . ' "
113098	113106	113107	113107	she	144	" There I watched him ride away , "
113120	113132	113114	113114	her	144	" watched , until the dark woods swallowed him . And here "
113139	113145	113107	113107	she	144	" here , we parted . "
113167	113171	113114	113114	her	144	" I LOVE THEE "
113202	113209	113210	113210	she	144	" Did you make me come ? "
113213	113219	113220	113220	he	132	" Nay , my beloved , "
113225	113244	113220	113220	he	132	" unless constant thought of thee , could bring thee to me . I pictured thee peacefully sleeping . "
113245	113251	113252	113252	she	144	" I could not sleep , "
113255	113295	113252	113252	she	144	" It seemed to me our Lady was not pleased , because , dear Knight , I have failed , in all these days , to tell you of her wondrous and especial grace which sent me to you . "
113296	113301	113303	113304	the Knight	764	" I have wondered , "
113306	113370	113303	113304	the Knight	764	" but I knew there would come a time when I should hear what caused thy mind to change . That it was a thing of much import , I felt sure . The Bishop counselled me to give up hope . But I had besought our Lady to send thee to me , and I could not lose my trust in prayer . "
113371	113382	113384	113384	Mora	144	" It was indeed our blessed Lady who sent me , "
113389	113424	113384	113384	Mora	144	" Hugh , dare I stay and tell you the whole story , here and now ? What if we are discovered , alone upon the ramparts , at this hour of the night ? "
113432	113436	113437	113437	he	132	" Dear Heart , "
113440	113479	113437	113437	he	132	" we shall not be discovered . And , if we were , methinks we have the right to be together , on the ramparts , or off them , at any hour of the day or night . "
113503	113515	113490	113490	Mora	144	" Sit here , Hugh . Then we can talk low . "
113516	113522	113524	113525	the Knight	764	" I listen better standing , "
113559	113562	113563	113563	she	144	" Hugh , "
113566	113666	113563	113563	she	144	" I withstood your pleadings ; I withstood the Bishop 's arguments ; I withstood the yearnings of my own poor heart . I tore up the Pope 's mandate , and set my foot upon it . I said that nothing could induce me to break my vows , unless our Lady herself gave me a clear sign that my highest duty was to you , thus absolving me from my vows , and making it evident that God 's will for me was that I should leave the Cloister , and keep my early troth to you . "
113667	113676	113678	113679	the Knight	764	" And gave our Lady such a sign ? "
113703	113709	113710	113710	she	144	" Better than a sign , "
113713	113734	113710	113710	she	144	" Our Lady vouchsafed a wondrous vision , in which her own voice was heard , giving command and consent . "
113877	113888	113889	113889	he	764	" Tell me more ; nay , tell me all , "
113892	113896	113898	113898	Mora	144	" The vision , "
113900	113913	113898	113898	Mora	144	" was given to the old lay - sister , Mary Antony . "
113914	113918	113920	113920	Hugh	132	" Mary Antony ? "
113926	114002	113920	113920	Hugh	132	" ' The old lay - sister , Mary Antony ' ? Why do I know that name ? I seem to remember that the Bishop spoke of her , as we walked together in the Palace garden , the day following the arrival of the messenger from Rome . Methinks the Bishop said that she alone knew of my intrusion into the Nunnery ; but that she , being faithful , could be trusted . "
114003	114008	114010	114010	Mora	144	" Nay , Hugh , "
114012	114185	114010	114010	Mora	144	" you mistake . It was I who told you so , even before I knew you were the intruder , while yet addressing you as Sister Seraphine 's ' Cousin Wilfred . ' I said that you had been thwarted in your purpose by the faithfulness of the old lay - sister , Mary Antony , who never fails to count the White Ladies , as they go , and as they return , and who had reported to me that one more had returned than went . Afterward I was greatly perplexed as to what explanation I should make to Mary Antony ; when , to my relief , she came and confessed that hers was the mistake , she having counted wrongly . Glad indeed was I to let it rest at that ; so neither she , nor any in the Convent , knew aught of your entrance there or your visit to my cell . The Bishop , you , and I , alone know of it . "
114186	114191	114193	114194	the Knight	764	" Then I mistake , "
114196	114232	114193	114194	the Knight	764	" But I felt certain I had heard the name , and that the owner thereof had some knowledge of my movements . Now , I pray thee , dear Heart , tell me all . "
114291	114373	114286	114286	he	764	" Oh , true ! Most true ! More true than thou canst know . Left alone in thy cell , I kneeled to our Lady , saying those very words : ' Mother of God , send her to me ! Take pity on a hungry heart , a lonely home , a desolate hearth , and send her to me . ' I was alone . Only our Lady whom I besought , heard those words pass my lips . "
114666	114670	114671	114671	he	764	" My beloved , "
114674	114702	114671	114671	he	764	" if the vision had not been given , wouldst thou not have come to me ? Should I have had to ride away from Worcester alone ? "
114712	114807	114707	114707	she	144	" Dear Hugh , my most faithful and loyal Knight , being here and oh so glad to be here how can I say it ? Yet I must answer truly . But for the vision , I should not have come . I could not have broken my vows . No blessing would have followed had I come to you , trailing broken vows , like chains behind me . But our Lady herself set me free and bid me go . Therefore I came to you ; and therefore am I here . "
114808	114826	114707	114707	she	144	" Tell me again the words our Lady said , when she put thy hand in mine . "
114827	114851	114707	114707	she	144	" Our Lady said : ' Take her . She hath been ever thine . I have but kept her for thee . ' "
114891	114897	114898	114898	he	3305	" Mora , my beloved , "
114901	114969	114898	114898	he	3305	" every fibre of my being cries out for thee . Yet I want thy happiness before my own ; and , above and beyond all else , I want the Madonna in my home . Even at our Lady 's bidding I can not take thee . Not until thine own sweet lips shall say : ' Take me ! I have been ever thine . ' "
115018	115024	115025	115025	she	3306	" Dear man of mine , "
115028	115143	115025	115025	she	3306	" to - night we are betrothed . But to - morrow I will ride home with thee . To - morrow shall be indeed our bridal day . I will say all I will say anything I will say everything thou wilt ! Nay , see ! The dawn is breaking in the east . Call it ' to - day ' TO - DAY , dear Knight ! But now let me flee away , to fathom my strange happiness alone . Then , to sleep in mine own chamber , and to awake refreshed , and ready to go with thee , Hugh , when and where and how thou wilt . "
115153	115156	115157	115157	he	764	" Go , "
115162	115213	115157	115157	he	764	" and our Lady be with thee . Our spirits to - night have had their fill of holy happiness . I ask no higher joy than to watch the breaking of the day which gives thee to me , knowing thee to be safely sleeping in thy chamber below . "
115214	115219	115220	115220	she	3308	" I love thee ! "
115597	115617	115593	115593	her	3323	" Our bridal day ! The day I give myself to Hugh ! The day he leads me home . "
115778	115788	115774	115774	she	3323	" Hugh , my husband , take me home . "
115845	115850	115851	115851	she	3323	" Take me home , "
115854	115864	115851	115851	she	3323	" Hugh , my husband , take me home . "
115877	115890	115832	115832	She	3323	" Do it now ! Do it now ! Do it now ! "
115926	115932	115933	115933	she	144	" What a bridal morn ! "
115936	115966	115933	115933	she	144	" All nature says ' Awake ! Arise ! ' Yet I have slept so late . I must quickly prepare myself to find and to greet my lover . "
115967	115972	115986	115987	the morn	3333	" Do it now ! "
116213	116218	116184	116184	He	228	" Do it now ! "
116225	116233	116184	116184	He	228	" HOW SHALL I LET THEE GO ? "
116242	116245	116246	116246	she	144	" Hugh , "
116254	116274	116246	116246	she	144	" Hugh , my husband , this is our bridal day . Will you take me to our home ? "
116366	116371	116372	116372	he	228	" Alas , Mora , "
116375	116481	116372	116372	he	228	" it is a hard fate indeed for me on this day , of all days , to be compelled to leave thee . But in the early morn there came a letter which obliges me , without delay , to ride south , in order to settle a matter of extreme importance . I trust not to be gone longer than nine days . You , being safely established in your own home , amongst your own people , I can leave without anxious fears . Moreover , Martin Goodfellow will remain here representing me , and will in all things do your bidding . "
116482	116502	116347	116347	he	228	" From whom is this letter , Hugh , which takes you from me , on such a day ? "
116503	116525	116372	116372	he	228	" It is from a man well known to me , dwelling in a city four days ' journey from here . "
116526	116551	116347	116347	he	228	" Why not say at once : ' It is from the Bishop , written from his Palace in the city of Worcester ' ? "
116555	116561	116562	116562	he	228	" How knew you that ? "
116568	116629	116372	116372	he	228	" My dear Knight , hearing much champing of horses in my courtyard , I looked down from a casement and saw a lay - brother well known to me , and three other horsemen wearing the Bishop 's livery . What can Symon of Worcester have written which takes you from me on this day , of all days ? "
116630	116638	116639	116639	he	228	" That I can not tell thee , "
116643	116729	116639	116639	he	228	" But he writes , without much detail , of a matter about which I must know fullest details , without loss of time . I have no choice but to ride and see the Bishop , face to face . It is not a question which can be settled by writing nor could it wait the passing to and fro of messengers . Believe me , Mora , it is urgent . Naught but exceeding urgency could force me from thee on this day . "
116730	116742	116743	116743	she	3345	" Has it to do with my flight from the Convent ? "
116751	116764	116748	116748	his	228	" Will you tell me the matter on your return , Hugh ? "
116765	116770	116771	116771	he	228	" I know not , "
116778	116784	116771	116771	he	228	" I can not say . "
116790	116845	116771	116771	he	228	" Oh , my God , Mora , ask me no more ! See the Bishop , I must ! Speak with him , I must ! In nine days at the very most , I will be back with thee . Duty takes me , my beloved , or I would not go . "
116853	116856	116846	116846	Her	3346	" duty , "
116857	116864	116865	116865	she	3346	" Go then , dear Knight , "
116868	116954	116865	116865	she	3346	" Settle this business with Symon of Worcester . I have no desire to know its purport . If it concerns my flight from the Convent , surely the Pope 's mandate is all - sufficient . But , be it what it may , in the hands of my faithful Knight and of my trusted friend , the Bishop , I may safely leave it . I do but ask that , the work accomplished , you come with all speed back to me . "
116968	116976	116977	116977	he	3347	" Send me away with a blessing , "
116980	116987	116977	116977	he	3347	" Bless me before I go . "
116997	117000	117001	117001	she	3346	" Alas ! "
117004	117012	117001	117001	she	3346	" how shall I let thee go ? "
117031	117039	117040	117040	she	3346	" How shall thy wife bless thee ? "
117064	117068	117069	117069	he	3347	" Bless me , "
117074	117096	117069	117069	he	3347	" as the Prioress of the White Ladies used to bless her nuns , and the Poor at the Convent gate . "
117097	117101	117102	117102	she	3346	" Dear Heart , "
117108	117115	117102	117102	she	3346	" That seems so long ago ! "
117152	117158	117159	117159	she	3346	" The Lord bless thee , "
117162	117188	117159	117159	she	3346	" and keep thee ; and may our blessed Lady , who hath restored me to thee , bring thee safely back to me again . "
117752	117769	117745	117745	she	3346	" Forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before "
117817	117824	117825	117825	she	3346	" This one thing I do , "
117829	117836	117825	117825	she	3346	" this one thing I do . "
117855	117860	117903	117907	a messenger from the Vatican	3374	" Do it now ! "
118126	118139	118122	118123	His servant	3082	" What horsemen have just now ridden into the courtyard , Jasper ? "
118140	118154	118116	118116	He	4673	" My lord , Brother Philip has this moment returned , and with him "
118155	118165	118122	118123	His servant	3082	" Bid Brother Philip to come hither , instantly . "
118166	118174	118116	118116	He	4673	" May it please you , my lord "
118175	118181	118183	118184	the Bishop	4673	" Naught will please me , "
118186	118198	118183	118184	the Bishop	4673	" but that my commands be obeyed without parley or delay . "
118327	118337	118338	118338	he	4673	" Thou art quickly returned , my good Philip , "
118345	118383	118338	118338	he	4673	" Thou has done better than my swiftest expectations . Didst thou give my letter thyself into the hands of Sir Hugh d'Argent , and hast thou brought me back an answer from that most noble Knight ? "
118474	118477	118479	118480	the Bishop	4673	" You ! "
118490	118495	118479	118480	the Bishop	4673	" You ? Here ! "
118496	118501	118503	118504	the Knight	764	" Yes , I , "
118506	118563	118503	118504	the Knight	764	" I ! Does it surprise you , my Lord Bishop , that I should be here ? Would it not rather surprise you , in view of that which you saw fit to communicate to me by letter , that I should fail to be here and here as fast as horse could bring me ? "
118564	118569	118571	118572	the Bishop	4673	" Naught surprises me , "
118576	118664	118571	118572	the Bishop	4673	" I have lived so long in the world , and had to do with so many crazy fools , that human vagaries no longer have power to surprise me . And , by our Lady , Sir Knight , I care not where you are , so that you have left safe and well , her peace of mind undisturbed , the woman whom I acting as mouthpiece of the Pope and Holy Church gave , not two weeks ago , into your care and keeping . "
118672	118740	118665	118666	The Knight	764	" It might be well , my Lord Bishop , to leave our blessed Lady 's name out of this conversation . It hath too much been put to shameful and treacherous use . Mora is safe and well . How far her peace of mind can be left undisturbed , I am here to discover . I require , before aught else , the entire truth . "
118769	118800	118801	118801	He	4673	" Nay , my dear Knight , before aught else you require a bath ! Truly it offends my love of the beautiful to see you in this dusty plight . "
118807	119022	118801	118801	He	4673	" Also you require a good meal , served with a flagon of my famous Italian wine . You did well to come here in person , my son . If naught hath been said to Mora , no harm is done ; and together we can doubly safeguard the matter . I rejoice that you have come . But the strain of rapid travelling , when anxiety drives , is great . . . . Jasper , prepare a bath for Sir Hugh d'Argent in mine own bath - chamber ; cast into it some of that fragrant and refreshing powder sent to me by the good brethren of Santa Maria Novella . While the noble Knight bathes , lay out in the ante - chamber the complete suit of garments he was wearing on the day when the sudden fancy seized him to have a swim in our river . I conclude they have been duly dried and pressed and laid by with sweet herbs ? . . . Good . That is well . Now , my dear Hugh , allow Jasper to attend you . He will give his whole mind to your comfort . Send word to Brother Philip , Jasper , that I will speak with him here . "
119228	119236	119238	119239	the Bishop	4673	" Come in , my good Philip , "
119241	119287	119238	119239	the Bishop	4673	" come in , and shut the door . . . . I must have thy report with fullest detail ; but , time being short , I would ask thee to begin from the moment when the battlements of Castle Norelle came into view . "
119393	119398	119383	119383	she	144	" I love thee . "
119409	119435	119403	119403	she	144	" Dear man of mine , I love thee ! Come back to me safe ; come back to me soon ; I love thee ! "
119902	119922	119892	119892	he	132	" Take pity on a lonely home , a desolate hearth . . . and send her to me . "
120038	120050	120033	120033	Icon	174	" I am ready , dear Knight ; let us go . "
120251	120254	120255	120255	he	133	" Lady , "
120258	120362	120255	120255	he	133	" there waits a man below who urgently desires speech with Sir Hugh . Learning from us that the Knight hath ridden south , and is like to be away some days longer , he begs to have word with you , alone ; yet refuses to state his business or to give his name . Master Zachary greatly hopeth that it may be your pleasure that we bid the fellow forthwith depart , telling him if he so will to ride back in six days ' time , when the worshipful Knight , whom he desires to see , will have returned . "
120386	120392	120393	120393	she	144	" Describe him , Martin , "
120396	120404	120393	120393	she	144	" What manner of man is he ? "
120405	120408	120410	120410	Martin	133	" Swarthy , "
120412	120434	120410	120410	Martin	133	" and soldierly ; somewhat of a dare - devil , but on his best behaviour . Zachary and I would suggest "
120435	120441	120443	120443	Mora	144	" I will see him , "
120451	120519	120443	120443	Mora	144	" I will see him in the banqueting hall , and alone . You , Martin , can wait without , entering on the instant if I call . Tell Zachary to bid them prepare a meal of bread and meat , with a flagon of wine , or a pot of good ale , which I may offer to this traveller , should he need refreshment . "
120602	120653	120599	120599	She	144	" You wished to see my husband , Friend , and speak with him ? He is away and hardly can return before five days , at soonest . Is your business with Sir Hugh such as I can pass on to him for you , by word of mouth ? "
120699	120725	120687	120687	his	132	" Most noble Lady , failing the Knight , whom I have ridden far to find , my business may most readily be told to you .
120726	120869	120687	120687	his	132	" Years ago , on a Syrian battle - field it was my good fortune , in the thick of the fray , to find myself side by side with Sir Hugh d'Argent . The Infidels struck me down ; and , sorely wounded , I should have been at their mercy , had not the noble Knight , seeing me fall , wheeled his horse and , riding back , hewn his way through to me , scattering mine assailants right and left . Then , helping me to mount behind him , galloped with me back to camp . Whereupon I swore , by the holy Cross at Lucca , that if ever the chance came my way to do a service to Sir Hugh of the Silver Shield , I would travel to the world 's end to do it .
120870	121010	120687	120687	his	132	" Ten nights ago , I chanced to be riding through a wood somewhere betwixt Worcester and Warwick . A band of lawless fellows coming by , I and my steed drew off the path , taking cover in a thicket . But a solitary horseman , riding from Worcester , failed to avoid them . Within sight of my hiding - place he was set upon , made to dismount , stripped and bidden to return on foot to the place from whence he came . I could do naught to help him . We were two , to a round dozen . The robbers took the money from his wallet . Within it they found also a letter , which they flung away as worthless . I marked where it fell , close to my hiding - place .
121011	121121	120687	120687	his	132	" When the affray was over , their victim having fled and the lawless band ridden off , I came forth , picked up the letter and slipped it into mine own wallet . So soon as the sun rose I drew forth the letter , when , to my amaze , I found it addressed to my brave rescuer , the Knight of the Silver Shield and Azure Pennant . It appeared to be of importance as , failing Warwick Castle , six halting places , all on the northward road , were named on the outside ; also it was marked to be delivered with most urgent haste .
121122	121197	120687	120687	his	132	" It seemed to me that now had come my chance , to do this brave Knight service . Therefore have I ridden from place to place , following ; and , after some delay , I find myself at length at Castle Norelle , only to hear that he to whom I purposed to hand the letter has ridden south by another road . Thus is my endeavour to serve him rendered fruitless . "
121198	121203	121205	121205	Mora	144	" Nay , Friend , "
121213	121269	121205	121205	Mora	144	" Not fruitless . Give me the letter you have thus rescued and faithfully attempted , to deliver . My husband returns in five days . I will then hand him the letter and tell him your tale . Most grateful will he be for your good service , and moved by your loyal remembrance . "
121336	121349	121350	121350	she	144	" In my husband 's name , I thank you , Friend , "
121353	121378	121350	121350	she	144	" And now my people will put before you food and wine . You must have rest and refreshment before you again set forth . "
121379	121386	121388	121389	the stranger	3443	" I thank you , no , "
121391	121442	121388	121389	the stranger	3443	" I must ride on , without delay . I bid you farewell , Lady ; and I do but wish the service , which a strange chance has enabled me to render to the Knight , had been of greater importance and had held more of risk or danger . "
122221	122228	122215	122215	he	4673	" most wise and prudent babe . "
122474	122478	122479	122479	she	144	" Blessed Virgin , "
122487	122539	122479	122479	she	144	" I , who have been twice deceived tricked into entering the Cloister , and tricked into leaving it I beseech thee , by the sword which pierced through thine own soul also , grant me now a vision which shall be , in very deed , a VISION OF TRUTH . "
122856	122863	122865	122866	the Bishop	4673	" Well , my dear Hugh , "
122922	122922	122933	122934	the Knight	764	"
122923	122931	122933	122934	the Knight	764	" I have come , my lord , "
122943	122991	122933	122934	the Knight	764	" to learn from your lips the entire truth concerning that vision which caused the Prioress of the White Ladies to hold herself free to renounce her vows , leave her Nunnery , and give herself in marriage where she had been betrothed before entering the Cloister . "
122992	122995	122997	122998	the Bishop	4673	" Tut ! "
123000	123085	122997	122998	the Bishop	4673	" The White Ladies have no Prioress . Mother Sub - Prioress doth exercise the functions of that office until such time as the Prior and myself shall make a fresh appointment . We are not here to talk of prioresses , my son , but of that most noble and gracious lady who , by the blessing of God and our Lady 's especial favour , is now your wife . See to it that you continue to deserve your great good fortune . "
123138	123164	123165	123166	Both men	1572	" So you wish the entire history of the inspired devotion of the old lay - sister , Mary Antony may God rest her soul . "
123178	123212	123172	123173	the Bishop	4673	" Shall I give it you now , my son , or will you wait until the morrow , when a good night 's rest shall fit you better to enjoy the recital ? "
123213	123217	123219	123219	Hugh	132	" My lord , "
123221	123238	123219	123219	Hugh	132	" ere this sun sets , I hope to be many miles on my homeward way . "
123239	123244	123246	123247	the Bishop	4673	" In that case , "
123249	123262	123246	123247	the Bishop	4673	" I must tell you this moving story , without further delay . "
123496	123513	123487	123487	Mora	144	" Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes "
123528	123542	123520	123520	himself	4673	" An ancient babe ! Truly , a most wise and prudent babe . "
123586	123592	123594	123596	Symon of Worcester	154	" Therefore , my son , "
123598	123698	123594	123596	Symon of Worcester	154	" when on a sudden I remembered our conversation on the lawn , and that I had told you of my belief that the old lay - sister knew of your visit to the Convent and had seen you in Mora 's cell , I hastened to send you a warning , lest you should , unwittingly , mention this fact to Mora , and raise a doubt in her mind concerning the genuineness of the vision , thus destroying her peace , and threatening her happiness and your own . Hath she already told you of the vision ? "
123710	123732	123703	123704	the Knight	764	" The evening before the messenger arrived , bringing your letter , my lord , Mora told me of the vision . "
123733	123743	123703	123704	the Knight	764	" Said you aught concerning my words to you ? "
123744	123853	123703	123704	the Knight	764	" So soon as she mentioned the name of Mary Antony , I said that I seemed to recall that you , my lord , had told me she alone knew of my visit to the Convent . But Mora at once said nay , that it was she herself who had told me so , even while I stood undiscovered in her cell ; but that afterward the lay - sister had confessed herself mistaken . This seemed to me to explain the matter , therefore I said no more ; nor did I , for a moment , doubt the truth and wonder of the vision . "
123854	123863	123865	123866	the Bishop	4673	" For that , the saints be praised , "
123868	123913	123865	123866	the Bishop	4673	" Then no harm is done . You and I , alone , know the entire story ; and you and I , who would safeguard Mora 's happiness with our lives , must see to it that she never has cause for misgivings . "
123927	123931	123932	123932	he	132	" My lord , "
123935	123972	123932	123932	he	132	" had there been no vision , no message from our Lady , no placing by her of Mora 's hand in mine , think you she would have left the Nunnery and come to me ? "
123973	124033	123917	123917	his	132	" Nay , dear lad , that I know she would not . On that very morning , as I told you , she set her foot upon the Pope 's mandate , and would accept no absolving from her vows . Naught would suffice , said she , but a direct vision and revelation from our Lady herself . "
124034	124037	124039	124040	the Knight	764	" But , "
124044	124068	124039	124040	the Knight	764	" was there a vision , my lord ? Was there a revelation ? Was there a spoken message or a given sign ? "
124094	124161	124039	124040	the Knight	764	" Between ourselves , my dear Hugh though even so , it is not well to be too explicit between ourselves of course nothing well miraculous happened , beyond the fact that our Lady most certainly sharpened the wits of old Antony . Therefore is it , that you undoubtedly owe your wife to those same wits , and may praise our Lady for sharpening them . "
124173	124178	124179	124179	he	764	" And I refuse , "
124182	124195	124179	124179	he	764	" to owe my wife to sacrilege , fraud , and falsehood . "
124264	124267	124268	124268	he	4673	" Fool ! "
124271	124284	124268	124268	he	4673	" Ungrateful , unspeakable fool ! What mean you by such words ? "
124285	124297	124299	124300	the Knight	764	" Call me fool if you will , my Lord Bishop , "
124318	124318	124299	124300	the Knight	764	"
124319	124327	124329	124330	the Bishop	4673	" What mean you by such words ? "
124332	124371	124329	124330	the Bishop	4673	" I mean , my lord , that if the truth opened out an abyss which plunged me into hell , I would sooner know it than attempt to enter Paradise across the flimsy fabric of a lie . "
124416	124423	124424	124424	he	154	" By Saint Peter 's keys ! "
124427	124494	124424	124424	he	154	" I care not , Sir Knight , whether you drop to hell or climb to Paradise . But it is my business to see to it that you do not disturb the peace of mind of the woman you have we d. Therefore I warn you , that if you ride from here set upon so doing , you will not reach your destination alive . "
124519	124590	124509	124509	his	764	" I can not draw my sword upon threats , my Lord Bishop ; but let those threats take human shape , and by Saint George , I shall find pleasure in rendering a good account of them . With this same sword I once did hew my way through a score of Saracens . Think you a dozen Worcester cut - throats could keep me from reaching my wife ? "
125106	125112	125114	125115	the Bishop	4673	" Wherefore doth it waft ? "
125126	125136	125114	125115	the Bishop	4673	" Wherefore ? Wherefore ? Wherefore doth it waft ? "
125137	125144	125146	125147	the Knight	764	" Drink this , Reverend Father , "
125149	125163	125146	125147	the Knight	764	" I implore you , my dear lord , raise yourself and drink . "
125164	125172	125174	125175	the Bishop	4673	" Methinks there must be a draught , "
125177	125182	125184	125185	the Knight	764	" Yea , truly , "
125187	125201	125184	125185	the Knight	764	" of your famous Italian wine . Father , I pray you drink . "
125202	125207	125209	125210	the Bishop	4673	" Among the rafters , "
125273	125280	125281	125281	he	4673	" Ah , my dear Hugh , "
125288	125319	125281	125281	he	4673	" it is good to find you here . Let us continue our conversation , if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed . I have much to say to you . "
125413	125504	125651	125652	the Bishop	4673	" Therefore , my dear Hugh , I have now given you in detail the true history of the vision , making it clear that we owe it , alas ! to earthly devotion , rather than to Divine interposition though indeed the one may well be the means used by the other . It remains for us to consider , and to decide upon , the best line to take with Mora in order to safeguard most surely her peace of mind , and permanently to secure her happiness . "
125505	125513	125515	125516	the Knight	764	" I have considered , Reverend Father , "
125520	125526	125515	125516	the Knight	764	" and I have decided . "
125527	125538	125545	125545	his	154	" What have you decided to do , my son ? "
125549	125566	125545	125545	his	154	" To make known to Mora , so soon as I return , the entire truth . "
125597	125620	125515	125516	the Knight	764	" And what effect do you suppose such a communication will have , my son , upon the mind of your wife ? "
125621	125640	125567	125568	The Bishop	4673	" I am not called to face suppositions , Reverend Father ; I am simply confronted by facts . "
125641	125649	125651	125652	the Bishop	4673	" Precisely , my son , precisely , "
125668	125737	125651	125652	the Bishop	4673	" Yet even while dealing with causes , it is well sometimes to consider effects , lest they take us wholly unawares . Do you realise that , as your wife felt justified in leaving the Nunnery and wedding you , solely by reason of our Lady 's miraculously accorded permission , when she learns that that permission was not miraculous , she will cease to feel justified ? "
125738	125744	125746	125747	the Knight	764	" I greatly fear it , "
125749	125761	125567	125568	The Bishop	4673	" Do you yourself now consider that she was not justified ? "
125762	125765	125767	125768	the Knight	764	" Nay ! "
125774	125876	125767	125768	the Knight	764	" Always , since I learned how we had been tricked by her sister , I have held her to be rightfully mine . Heaven knew , when she made her vows , that I was faithful , and she therefore still my betrothed . Heaven allowed me to discover the truth , and to find her alive , and still unwed . To my thinking , no Divine pronouncement was required ; and when the Holy Father 's mandate arrived bringing the Church 's sanction , why then indeed naught seemed to stand between us . But Mora thought otherwise . "
125907	126024	125882	125883	the Bishop	4673	" Have you ever heard tell , my son , that two negatives make an affirmative ? Think you not that , in something the same way , two deceptions may make a truth . Mora was deceived into entering the Convent , and deceived into leaving it ; but from out that double deception arises the great truth that she has , in the sight of Heaven , been all along yours . The first deception negatives the second , and the positive fact alone remains that Mora is wedded to you , is yours to guard and shield from sorrow ; and those whom God hath joined together , let no man put asunder . "
126034	126045	126046	126046	he	132	" I trust the matter may appear thus to Mora , "
126071	126078	126079	126079	he	92	" It will not so appear , "
126082	126129	126079	126079	he	92	" My good Hugh , when your wife learns from you that she was tricked by Mary Antony , she will go back in mind to where she was before the spurious vision , and will feel herself to be still Prioress of the White Ladies . "
126130	126143	126145	126146	the Knight	764	" I have so felt her , since the knowledge reached me , "
126164	126201	126079	126079	he	92	" And what then do you propose to do , my son , with this wedded Prioress ? Do you expect her to remain with you in your home , content to fulfil her wifely duties ? "
126202	126206	126208	126209	the Knight	764	" I fear , "
126212	126219	126208	126209	the Knight	764	" that she will leave me . "
126220	126230	126232	126233	the Bishop	4673	" And I am certain she will leave you , "
126235	126301	126079	126079	he	92	" It was largely this fear for the future which brought me at once to you , my lord . If Mora desires , as you say , to consider herself as she was , before she was tricked into leaving the Convent , will you arrange that she shall return , unquestioned , to her place as Prioress of the White Ladies of Worcester ? "
126302	126305	126307	126308	the Bishop	4673	" Impossible ! "
126312	126335	126307	126308	the Bishop	4673	" It is too late . We can have no Madonna groups in Nunneries , saving those carven in marble or stone . "
126359	126366	126348	126349	the Knight	764	" It is not too late . "
126401	126404	126405	126405	he	4673	" Fool ! "
126436	126454	126431	126434	so foolish a knight	3593	" What was the trouble , boy ? Didst find that after all she loved thee not ? "
126455	126458	126460	126460	Hugh	132	" Nay , "
126464	126832	126460	126460	Hugh	132	" I thank God , and our Lady , that my wife loves me as I never dreamed that such as I could be loved by one so perfect in all ways as she . But at first all was so new and strange to her . It was wonder enough to be out in the world once more , free to come and go ; to ride abroad , looking on men and things . I put her welfare first . . . . Nay , it was easy , loving her as I loved , also greatly desiring the highest and the best . Father , I wanted what you spoke of as the Madonna in the Home . Therefore ' twas I who made the plan we agreed that , the wedding having of necessity been so hurried , the courtship should follow , and we would count ourselves but betrothed , even after reaching Castle Norelle , for just so many days or weeks as she should please ; until such time as she herself should tell me she was wishful that I should take her home . But each day of the ride northward had been more perfect than that which went before ; each hour of each day , sweeter than the preceding . Thus it came to pass that on the very evening of our arrival at Mora 's home , after parting for the night at the door of her chamber , we met again on the battlements , where years before we had said farewell ; and there , seated in the moonlight , she told me the wonder of our Lady 's grace in the vision ; and , afterwards , in words of perfect tenderness , the even greater wonder of her love , and that she was ready on the morrow to ride home with me . So we parted in a rapture so deep and pure , that sleep came , for very joy of it . But early in the morning I was wakened by a rapping at my door , and there stood Brother Philip , holding your letter , Reverend Father . "
126833	126836	126838	126839	the Bishop	4673	" Alas ! "
126841	126863	126838	126839	the Bishop	4673	" Would that I had known she would have whereby to explain away thy memory of that which I had said . "
127444	127449	127450	127450	he	4673	" My dear Hugh , "
127453	127574	127450	127450	he	4673	" you did well to come to me in order to consult over these plans before taking the irrevocable step which should set them in motion . I , alone , could reinstate your wife as Prioress of the White Ladies ; moreover my continued presence here would be essential , to secure her comfort in that reinstatement . And I shall not be here . I am shortly leaving Worcester , leaving this land and returning to my beauteous Italy . The Holy Father has been pleased to tell me privately of high preferment shortly to be offered me . I have to - day decided to accept it . I return to Italy a Cardinal of Holy Church . "
127591	127669	127588	127588	his	132	" My Lord High Cardinal , I congratulate you ! That a cardinal 's hat should tempt you from your cathedral , from this noble English city , from your people who love you , from the land of your birth , may perhaps be understood . But that , for the sake of Church preferment , however high , you should willingly depart , leaving Mora in sorrow , Mora in difficulty , Mora needing your help "
127726	127732	127734	127734	Symon	154	" Ah , foolish lad ! "
127738	128022	127734	127734	Symon	154	" bent upon thine own ways , and easy to deceive . When I spoke of going , I said it for her sake , hoping the prospect of my absence might hold you from your purpose . But now truly am I convinced that you are bent upon risking your own happiness , and imperilling hers . Therefore will I devise some means of detaining the Holy Father 's messenger , so that my answer need not be given until two weeks are past . You will reach Mora , at longest , five days from this . As soon as she decides what she will do , send word to me by a fast messenger . Should she elect to return to the Nunnery , state when and where , upon the road , I am to meet her . Her habit as Prioress , and her cross of office , I have here . The former you returned to me , from the hostel ; the latter I found in her cell . You must take them with you . If she returns , she must return fully robed . If , on the other hand , she should decide to remain with you ; if as may God grant she is content , and requires no help from me , send me this news by messenger . I can then betake myself to that fair land to which I first went for her sake ; left for her sake , and to which I shall most gladly return , if her need of me is over . The time I state allows a four days ' margin for vacillation . "
128023	128027	128029	128030	the Knight	764	" My lord , "
128034	128087	128029	128030	the Knight	764	" forgive the wrong I did you . Forgive that I took in earnest that which you meant in jest ; or rather , I do truly think , that which you hoped would turn me from my purpose . Alas , I would indeed that I might rightly be turned therefrom . "
128088	128091	128093	128094	the Bishop	4673	" Hugh , "
128098	128113	128093	128094	the Bishop	4673	" you deemed her justified in coming to you , apart from any vision . "
128114	128117	128119	128120	the Knight	764	" True , "
128122	128191	128119	128120	the Knight	764	" but I can not feel justified in taking her , and all she would give me , knowing she gives it , with a free heart , because of her faith in the vision . Moments of purest joy would be clouded by my secret shame . Being aware of the deception , I too should be deceiving her ; I , whom she loves and trusts . "
128192	128202	128204	128205	the Bishop	4673	" To withhold a truth is not to lie , "
128207	128211	128213	128213	Hugh	132	" My lord , "
128230	128429	128224	128224	his	132	" I can not reason of these things ; I can not define the difference between withholding a truth and stating a lie . But when mine Honour sounds a challenge , I hear ; and I ride out to do battle against myself , if need be ; or , if it must so be , against another . On Eastern battle - fields , in Holy War , I won a name known throughout all the camp , known also to the enemy : ' The Knight of the Silver Shield . ' Our name is Argent , and we ever have the right to carry a pure silver shield . But I won the name because my shield was always bright ; because not once in battle did it fall in the dust ; because it never was allowed to tarnish . So bright it was , that as I rode , bearing it before me , reflecting the rays of the sun , it dazzled and blinded the enemy . My lord , I can not tarnish my silver shield by conniving at falsehood , or keeping silence when mine Honour bids me speak . "
128485	128490	128491	128491	he	3637	" My dear Hugh , "
128494	128687	128491	128491	he	3637	" all this talk , of a silver shield and of the challenge of honour , is well enough for the warrior on the battle - field . But the lover has to learn the harder lesson ; he has to give up Self , even the Self which holds honour dear . When you polished your silver shield , keeping it so bright , what saw you reflected therein ? Why , your own proud face . Even so , now , you fear the faintest tarnish on your sense of honour , but you will keep that silver shield bright at Mora 's expense , riding on proudly alone in your glory , reflecting the sun , dazzling all beholders , while your wife who loved and trusted you , Mora , who told you the sweet wonder of her love in words of deepest tenderness , lies desolate in the dark , with a shattered life , and a broken heart . Hugh , I would have you think of the treasure of her golden heart , rather than of the brightness of your own selfish , silver shield . "
128688	128691	128693	128694	the Knight	764	" Selfish ! "
128696	128747	128693	128694	the Knight	764	" Selfish ! Is it selfish to hold honour dear ? Is it selfish to be ashamed to deceive the woman one loves ? Have I , who have so striven in all things to put her welfare first , been selfish towards my wife in this hour of crisis ? "
128803	128811	128812	128812	he	764	" Perilously selfish , my dear Hugh , "
128815	128867	128812	128812	he	764	" But , thank Heaven , no harm has yet been done . Listen to me and I will shew you how you may keep your honour safely untarnished , yet withhold from Mora all knowledge which might cause her disquietude of mind , thus securing her happiness and your own . "
129456	129486	129443	129444	Hugh d'Argent	132	" When , my lord , do you propose to meet the Prioress , should my wife , upon learning the truth , elect to return to the Nunnery ? "
129642	129655	129657	129658	the Knight	764	" I must take her cross of office , my Lord Bishop , "
129734	129842	129719	129719	he	4673	" I entrust it to you , my dear Hugh , only on one condition : that it shall without fail return to me in two weeks ' time . Should you decide to tell your wife the true history of the vision , I must see this cross of office upon her breast when I meet her riding back to Worcester , once more Prioress of the White Ladies . If , on the other hand , wiser counsel prevails , and you decide not to tell her , you must , by swift messenger , at once return it to me in a sealed packet . "
129843	129849	129851	129852	the Knight	764	" I shall tell her , "
129854	129888	129851	129852	the Knight	764	" If she elects to leave me , you will see the cross upon her breast , my lord . If she elects to stay , you shall receive it by swift messenger . "
129889	129895	129897	129898	the Bishop	4673	" She will leave you , "
129900	129911	129897	129898	the Bishop	4673	" If you tell her , she will leave you . "
129912	129917	129919	129920	the Knight	764	" She loves me , "
129952	129955	129957	129958	the Bishop	4673	" Hugh , "
129962	130060	129957	129958	the Bishop	4673	" Hugh , my dear lad , you have but little experience of the heart of a nun . The more she loves , the more determined will she be to leave you , if you yourself give her reason to think her love unjustified . The very thing which is now a cause of bliss will instantly become a cause for fear . She will flee from joy , as all pure hearts flee from sin ; because , owing to your folly , her joy will seem to her to be sinful . My son ! "
130076	130099	130065	130065	his	4673	" God and Holy Church have given you your wife . If you tell her this thing , you will lose her . "
130100	130112	130114	130115	the Knight	764	" I must take with me the dress she left behind , "
130134	130134	130114	130115	the Knight	764	"

130265	130272	130274	130275	the Knight	764	" I thank you , Father , "
130277	130296	130274	130275	the Knight	764	" but it is not needful . The good Brother has had many long days in the saddle . "
130297	130303	130305	130306	the Bishop	4673	" It is most needful , "
130308	130347	130305	130306	the Bishop	4673	" Let Philip ride beside you until you have passed through the Monk 's Wood , and are well on to the open ground beyond . There , if you will , you may bid him turn back . "
130348	130365	130274	130275	the Knight	764	" Is this to ensure the safety of the Worcester cut - throats , my lord ? "
130370	130373	130374	130374	he	4673	" Possibly , "
130377	130452	130374	130374	he	4673	" Saracens may be hewn in pieces , with impunity . But we can not allow our Worcester lads rashly to ride to such a fate . Also , my dear Hugh , you carry things of so great value that we must not risk a scuffle . These are troublous times , and dangers lurk around the city . Three miles from here you may dismiss Brother Philip , and ride forward alone . "
130506	130524	130541	130541	he	764	" And may God and the blessed Saints aid thee to a right judgment in all things . "
130525	130528	130530	130531	Hugh d'Argent	132	" Amen , "

131873	131982	131870	131870	he	92	" thou shalt gather thyself a rose , and thou shall gather one for me . I leave thee free to make thy choice . See ! I clasp my hands behind me thus . Then I shall turn and walk slowly up the lawn . So soon as my back is turned , pluck thou two roses . Fly with those little brown feet after me , and place one of the roses whichever thou wilt in my hands . Then run home thyself , with the other . Farewell , little Angel - child . May the blessing of Bethlehem 's purple hills be ever thine . "

But first I would give thee this , sent to thee by the Bishop with his most loving greetings ; who also bids me say that if , after my tale is told , thy choice should be to return to Worcester , he himself will meet thee , and welcome thee , conduct thee to the Nunnery and there reinstate thee Prioress of the White Ladies , with due pomp and highest honour . I tell thee this at once to spare thee all I can of shock and anguish in the hearing of that which must follow . "
136039	136043	136044	136044	he	132	" My wife , "
136056	136109	136044	136044	he	132	" before I tell thee more I would have thee know thyself free to go back to the point where first thy course was guided by the vision of the old lay - sister , Mary Antony . Therefore I bring thee thy cross of office as Prioress of the White Ladies . "
136131	136143	136144	136144	she	3891	" How can thy wife be Prioress of the White Ladies ? "
136199	136207	136208	136208	he	132	" Oh , hush , my beloved ! "
136211	136237	136208	136208	he	132	" Hold me not ! Let me go , or our Lady knoweth I shall even now fail in the task which lies before me . "

136254	136267	136251	136251	she	3891	" hath made my man so strong that he will not fail . "
136283	136293	136294	136294	he	132	" The letter brought to me by Brother Philip , "
136297	136383	136294	136294	he	132	" told me something of that which I am about to tell thee . But I could not speak of it to thee until I knew it in fullest detail , and had consulted with the Bishop concerning its possible effect upon thy future . Hence my instant departure to Worcester . That which I now shall tell thee , I had , in each particular , from the Bishop in most secret conversations . He and I , alone , know of this matter . "
136662	136695	136658	136658	she	144	" Hugh , you have made no mention of the Bishop 's opinion as regards the effect of this upon myself . Did he advise that I be told the entire truth ? "
136700	136703	136704	136704	he	132	" Nay , "
136717	136813	136704	136704	he	132	" The Bishop had , as you indeed know , from the first considered our previous betrothal and your sister 's perfidy , sufficient justification for your release from all vows made through that deception . Armed with the Pope 's mandate , the Bishop saw no need for a divine manifestation , nor did he , from the first , believe in the vision of this old lay - sister . Yet , knowing you set great store by it , he feared for your peace of mind , should you learn the truth . "
136814	136826	136914	136914	his	132	" Did he command you not to tell me , Hugh ? "
136827	136852	136704	136704	he	132	" For love of you , Mora , out of tender regard for your happiness , the Bishop counselled me not to tell you . "
136853	136877	136914	136914	his	132	" He would have had you to become a party , with himself , and old Mary Antony , in my permanent deception ? "
136884	136906	136907	136907	he	132	" He would have had me to become a party , with himself , in securing your permanent peace , Mora , "
136976	137001	136939	136939	she	3909	" Then how came you to tell me , Hugh , that which might well imperil not only my peace but your own happiness ? "
137002	137005	137007	137008	the Knight	764	" Mora , "
137010	137259	137007	137008	the Knight	764	" if I have done wrong , may our blessed Lady pardon me , and comfort you . But I could not take my happiness knowing that it came to me by reason of a deception practised upon you . Our love must have its roots in perfect truthfulness and trust . Also you and I had together accepted the vision as divine . I had kneeled in your sight and praised our blessed Lady for this especial grace vouchsafed on my behalf . But now , knowing it to have been a sacrilegious fraud , every time you spoke with joy of the special grace , every time you blessed our Lady for her loving - kindness , I , by my silence , giving mute assent , should have committed sacrilege afresh . Aye , and in that wondrous moment which you promised should soon come , when you would have said : ' Take me ! I have been ever thine . Our Lady hath kept me for thee ! ' mine honour would have been smirched forever had I , keeping silence , taken advantage of thy belief in words which that old nun had herself invented , and put into the mouth of the blessed Virgin . The Bishop held me selfish because I put mine honour before my need of thee . He said I saw naught but mine own proud face , in the bright mirror of my silver shield . But "
137273	137368	137263	137263	his	764	" methinks I see there the face of God , or the nearest I know to His face ; and , behind Him , I see thy face , mine own beloved . I needs must put this , which I owe to honour and to our mutual trust , before mine own content , and utter need of thee . I should be shamed , did I do otherwise , to call thee wife of mine , to think of thee as mistress of my home , and of my heart the Queen . "
137469	137476	137477	137477	he	132	" The dress is also here , "
137480	137484	137485	137485	she	144	" What dress ? "
137537	137560	137490	137490	He	132	" Did you yourself think a vision needed , in order that I might be justified in leaving the Convent , Hugh ? "
137561	137566	137567	137567	he	132	" Nay , then , "
137570	137585	137567	137567	he	132	" always from the first I held thee mine in the sight of Heaven . "
137586	137605	137490	137490	He	132	" Are you of opinion that , the vision being proved no vision , I should go back ? "
137606	137609	137611	137612	the Knight	764	" No ! "
137627	137637	137490	137490	He	132	" Does the Bishop expect that I shall return ? "
137638	137641	137643	137644	the Knight	764	" Yes , "
137662	137668	137670	137670	Mora	144	" He would so expect , "
137672	137765	137670	137670	Mora	144	" He would be sure I should return . He remembers my headstrong temper , and my imperious will . He remembers how I tore the Pope 's mandate , placing my foot upon it . He knows I said how that naught would suffice me but a divine vision . Also he knoweth well the heart of a nun ; and when I asked him if the heart of a nun could ever become as the heart of other women , he did most piously ejaculate : ' Heaven forbid ? ' "
137798	137801	137802	137802	he	4673	" Mora , "
137805	138007	137802	137802	he	4673	" I leave thee free . I hold thee to no vows made through falsehood and fraud . I rate thy peace of mind before mine own content ; thy true well - being , before mine own desires . Leaving thee free , dear Heart , I must leave thee free to choose . Loving thee as I love thee , I can not stay here , yet leave thee free . My anguish of suspense would hamper thee . Therefore I purpose now to ride to my own home . Martin will ride with me . But tomorrow he will return , to ask if there is a message ; and the next day , and the next . The Bishop allowed four days for hesitation . If thy decision should be to return to the Nunnery , his command is that thou ride the last stage of the journey fully robed , wearing thy cross of office . He himself will meet thee five miles this side of Worcester , and riding in , with much pomp and ceremony , will announce to the Community that , the higher service to which His Holiness sent thee , being accomplished "
138008	138013	138198	138198	She	3921	" Accomplished , Hugh ? "
138020	138070	138014	138015	The Knight	764	" I quote the Bishop , Mora . He will explain that he now reinstates thee as Prioress of the Order . The entire Community will , he says , rejoice ; and he himself will be ever at hand to make sure that all is right for thee . "
138071	138082	138198	138198	She	3921	" These plans are well and carefully laid , Hugh . "
138083	138095	138014	138015	The Knight	764	" They who love thee have seen to that , Mora . "
138096	138107	138198	138198	She	3921	" Who will ride with me from here to Worcester ? "
138108	138135	138014	138015	The Knight	764	" Martin Goodfellow , and a little band of thine own people . A swifter messenger will go before to warn the Bishop of thy coming . "
138136	138142	138143	138143	she	3921	" And what of thee ? "
138146	138150	138152	138153	the Knight	764	" Of me ? "
138167	138197	138152	138153	the Knight	764	" Oh , I shall go forth , seeking a worthy cause for which to fight ; praying God I may soon be counted worthy to fall in battle . "
138210	138229	138198	138198	She	3921	" And if I find I can not go back , Hugh ? If I decide to stay ? "
138238	138252	138230	138230	He	764	" Mora , is there hope ? The Bishop said there was none . "
138253	138256	138257	138257	she	3921	" Hugh , "

138381	138384	138385	138385	she	3921	" Go ! "
138388	138420	138385	138385	she	3921	" Ah , for pity 's sake , go ! The heart of a nun might endure even this . But I ask thy mercy for the heart of a woman ! "

I shall be ready to start within an hour . But first I must despatch to Worcester , a packet of importance . Bid two of the men , who rode with us from Worcester , prepare to mount and return thither . If they start in an hour 's time , they can be well on their way , and make a safe lodging , before nightfall . "

141610	141618	141607	141607	she	144	" and I choose to ride alone . "
141868	141882	141854	141854	she	144	" I go to my husband , and I choose to ride alone . "
142219	142226	142227	142227	she	144	" I ride to my husband , "
142233	142241	142227	142227	she	144	" and I choose to ride alone ! "
142254	142259	142244	142244	she	144	" Jesu dulsis memoria ! "
142267	142272	142263	142263	she	144	" Dulsis ! Dulsis ! "

142684	142691	142692	142692	she	144	" Icon , brave and beautiful ! "
142695	142719	142692	142692	she	144	" Thou hast carried me here where I longed to be . Thy feet were well - nigh as swift as my desire . "
142729	142744	142721	142721	she	144	" Martin , where is my husband ? Where shall I find Sir Hugh ? "
142745	142749	142751	142751	Martin	133	" My lady , "
142753	142762	142751	142751	Martin	133	" I saw him last in the armoury . "
142763	142767	142768	142768	she	144	" The armoury ? "
142771	142794	142721	142721	she	144	" A chamber opening out of the great hall , facing toward the west , with steps leading down into the garden . "
142795	142801	142721	142721	she	144	" Even as my chamber ? "
142802	142823	142721	142721	she	144	" The armoury door faces the door of your chamber , Countess . The width of the hall lies between . "
142824	142861	142721	142721	she	144	" Can I reach my chamber without entering the hall , or passing the armoury windows ? I would rid me of my travel - stains , before I make my presence known to Sir Hugh . "
142862	142893	142721	142721	she	144	" Pass round to the right , and through the buttery ; then you reach the garden and the steps up to your chamber from the side beyond the armoury . "
142894	142922	142721	142721	she	144	" Good . Tell no one of my presence , Martin . I have here the key of my chamber . Has Sir Hugh asked for it ? "
142923	142968	142721	142721	she	144	" Nay , my lady ; nor guessed how often we rode hither . We reached the castle scarce two hours ago . The Knight bathed , and changed his dusty garments ; then dined alone . After which he went into the armoury . "
142969	142979	142721	142721	she	144	" When did you see him last , Martin ? "
142980	142995	142721	142721	she	144	" Two minutes ago , lady . I come this moment from the hall . "
142996	143004	142721	142721	she	144	" What was he doing , Martin ? "
143108	143113	143115	143116	Martin Goodfellow	133	" Truth to tell , "
143118	143133	143115	143116	Martin Goodfellow	133	" Sir Hugh was testing his armour , and sharpening his battle - axe . "
143213	143221	143196	143196	he	132	" Hugh , I am come home . "
144121	144125	144126	144126	he	132	" O God , "
144129	144214	144126	144126	he	132	" Thou seemest to me as a stranger , when I meet Thee on mine own life 's way . I know Thee as Babe divine ; I know Thee , crucified ; I know Thee risen , and ascending in such clouds of glory as hide Thee from mine earthbound sight . But , if Thou hast drawn near along the rocky footpath of each day 's common happenings , then have mine eyes indeed been holden , and I knew Thee not . "
144250	144260	144247	144248	Father Gervaise	185	" He ever liveth to make intercession for us . "
144268	144275	144276	144276	he	764	" Oh , if Thou livest , "
144279	144314	144276	144276	he	764	" and living , knowest ; and knowing , carest ; grant me a sign of Thy nearness a Vision of Life and of Love , which shall make clear this mist of uncertainty . "
144409	144487	144404	144404	he	132	" What said the Bishop ? That I saw reflected in my silver shield naught save mine own proud face ? But I told my wife that I see there the face of God , or the nearest I know to His face ; and , behind Him , her face the face of my beloved ; for , had I not put reverence and honour first , my very love for her would have been tarnished . "
144565	144609	144557	144558	the Rabbi	2885	" The Lord God is a Sun and Shield : The Lord will give Grace and Glory ; No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly . O Lord of Hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee . "
144628	144652	144623	144623	Hugh	132	" The face of God , my beloved , or the nearest I know to His face : and behind Him , thy face "
144789	144797	144799	144800	the Knight	764	" The Vision for which I prayed ! "
144802	144828	144799	144800	the Knight	764	" O , my God ! Is this the sign of Thy nearness ? Is this a promise that my wife will come to me ? "
144846	144853	144799	144800	the Knight	764	" Not a promise , Hugh , "
144862	144895	144799	144800	the Knight	764	" A sign of God 's nearness ; a proof of mine . Hugh , my own dear Knight , lift up your head and look . Your wife has come home . "
144954	144957	144958	144958	he	132	" Mora ? "
144961	144976	144958	144958	he	132	" Home ? To stay ? Hath a true vision then been granted thee ? "
144977	144982	144983	144983	she	5587	" Oh , Hugh , "
144986	145227	144983	144983	she	5587	" I have seen deep into the heart of a true man . I have seen myself unworthy , in the light of thy great loyalty . I have seen all others fail , but my Knight of the Silver Shield stand faithful . I have been shewn this by so strange a chance , that I humbly take it to be the Finger of God pointing out the pathway of His will . My pride is in the dust . My self - will lies slain . But my love for thee has become as great a thing as the heart of a woman may know . Thy faithfulness shames my poor doubts of thee . The richness of thy giving , beggars my yearning to bestow . Yet now at last thy wife can come to thee without a doubt , without a tremor , all hesitancy gone , all she is , and all she has , quite simply , thine . Oh , Hugh , thine own to do with as thou wilt . All these years kept for thee . Take me Ah ! . . . Oh , Hugh , thy strength ! Is this love , or is there some deeper , more rapturous word ? Oh , dear man of mine , how strong must have been the flood - gates , if this was the pent - up force behind them ! "
145285	145289	145290	145290	he	4112	" The Madonna ! "
145293	145300	145290	145290	he	4112	" The Madonna in my home . "
145314	145319	145320	145320	he	4112	" Not as Prioress , "
145323	145330	145320	145320	he	4112	" but as my adored wife . "
145341	145352	145353	145353	he	4112	" Not as Reverend Mother to a score of nuns , "
145356	145359	145353	145353	he	4112	" but as "
145378	145418	145360	145360	She	4113	" And did thy people come with thee , my sweetheart ? And how could a three hours ' ride be accomplished in this bridal array ? Oh , Heaven help me , Mora ! Thou art so beautiful ! "
145419	145422	145423	145423	she	4113	" Hush , "
145426	145473	145423	145423	she	4113	" thou dear , foolish man ! Heaven hath helped thee through worse straits than that ! Nay , I rode alone , and in my riding dress of green . Arrived here , I changed , in mine own chamber , to these marriage garments . "
145474	145480	145481	145481	He	4112	" In thine own chamber ? "
145490	145501	145481	145481	He	4112	" Here here , in thine own chamber , Mora ? "
145550	145554	145555	145555	she	4113	" Dear Heart , "
145558	145614	145555	145555	she	4113	" I could scarce come home unless I had a chamber to which to come ! Martin shewed me which had been thy mother 's , and daily in thine absence he and I rode over , and others with us , bringing all things needful , thus making it ready , against thy return . "
145615	145618	145619	145619	he	4112	" Ready ? "
145622	145627	145619	145619	he	4112	" Against my return ? "
145636	145647	145648	145648	she	4113	" I hope it will please thee , my lord , "
145651	145656	145648	145648	she	4113	" Come and see . "
145710	145716	145717	145717	he	4112	" I must carry thee , "
145720	145769	145717	145717	he	4112	" Not a step thither shalt thou walk . Thine own feet brought thee to the crypt ; others bore thee thence . Thy palfrey carried thee home ; thy palfrey bore thee here . But to our chamber , my wife , I carry thee , alone . "
145814	145822	145823	145823	she	4118	" Then carry me , dear Heart , "
145826	145834	145823	145823	she	4118	" but do not let me fall . "
145934	145955	145916	145916	he	4119	" Say again what thou didst say ten nights ago when we parted in the dawning , on the battlements . "
145956	145961	145962	145962	she	4118	" I love thee , "
146438	146443	146444	146444	she	91	" Here , bird , "
146449	146482	146444	146444	she	91	" I can not let thee miss thy cheese because the foolish old creature who taught thee to look for it , comes this way no more . Take it and begone ! "
146490	146495	146489	146501	The " jaunty little layman , " undismayed though the look was austere	4144	" jaunty little layman , "
146754	146762	146763	146763	she	91	" Oh , thou little winged thing , "
146766	146895	146763	146763	she	91	" who so easily could'st fly from me ! Dost thou use those wings of liberty to draw yet nearer ? In this place of high walls and narrow cells , they who have not full freedom , use to the full what freedom they possess , to turn , at my approach and fly from me . Not one if she could choose , would choose to come to me . . . . Is there any honour so great as that of being feared by all ? Is there any loneliness so great as by all to be hated ? That honour , little bird , is mine ; also that loneliness . Who then hath sent thee thus to essay to take both from me ? "
147233	147239	147240	147240	she	91	" For love of me , "
147243	147249	147240	147240	she	91	" For love of me . "
147298	147302	147303	147303	she	91	" For love ! "
147306	147326	147303	147303	she	91	" Not of that which I brought and gave , but of that which he thought me to be . "
147756	147789	147790	147790	He	2987	" She ever seemed as one apart , who walked among the stars ; yet full , to overflowing , of the milk of human kindness and the gracious balm of sympathy . "
147855	147917	147844	147844	his	2987	" Nay , verily ! Our excellent Sub - Prioress knows no Milky Way ! She is the brier , which hath sharply taught the tender flesh of each . She is the bed of nettles from which the most weary moves on to rest elsewhere . She is the fearsome burning , from which the frightened brands do snatch themselves ! "
148046	148051	148052	148052	she	91	" Give me tenderness , "
148220	148224	148225	148225	she	91	" O God , "
148228	148325	148225	148225	she	91	" I am not worthy to take Her place . My heart is hard and cold ; my tongue is ofttimes cruel ; my spirit is censorious . But I have learned a lesson from the bird and a lesson from the Babe ; and that which I know not teach Thou me . Create in me a new heart , O God , and renew a right spirit within me . Grant unto me to follow in Her gracious steps , and to rule , as She ruled , by that love which never faileth . "
148564	148569	148571	148571	Hugh	132	" What is it , "
148579	148582	148583	148583	she	144	" Hush ! "
148586	148595	148583	148583	she	144	" I seem to hear the Convent bell . "
148604	148610	148611	148611	he	132	" Nay , my beloved , "
148614	148631	148611	148611	he	132	" There is no place for echoes of the Cloister , in the harmony of home . "
148657	148661	148662	148662	she	144	" Dear Heart , "
148677	148779	148782	148782	she	144	" I have come home to thee with a completeness of glad giving and surrender , such as I did not dream could be , and scarce yet understand . But Hugh , my husband , to one who has known the calm and peace of the Cloister there will always be an inner sanctuary in which will sound the call to prayer and vigil . I am not less thine own nay , rather I shall ever be free to be more wholly thine because , as we first stood together in our chamber , I heard the Convent bell . "
