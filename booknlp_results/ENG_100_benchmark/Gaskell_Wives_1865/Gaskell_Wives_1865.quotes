But the bonnet was made of solid straw , and its only trimming was a plain white ribbon put over the crown , and forming the strings . Still , there was a neat little quilling inside , every plait of which Molly knew , for had she not made it herself the evening before , with infinite pains ? and was there not a little blue bow in this quilling , the very first bit of such finery Molly had ever had the prospect of wearing ?

2237	2365	2234	2234	he	676	" What 's your name , my dear ? He 's sadly behindhand with his rent , as I was saying , but if he 's really ill , I must see after Sheepshanks , who is a hardish man of business . What 's his complaint ? You 'll come to our school - scrimmage on Thursday , little girl what's - your - name ? Mind you send her , or bring her , Gibson ; and just give a word to your groom , for I 'm sure that pony was n't singed last year , now , was he ? Do n't forget Thursday , little girl what's - your - name ? it 's a promise between us , is it not ? "
2413	2420	2410	2410	she	147	" May I go , papa ? "
2430	2436	2438	2438	he	238	" Where , my dear ? "
2449	2461	2462	2462	she	147	" To the Towers on Thursday , you know . That gentleman "
2472	2476	2462	2462	she	147	" asked me . "
2477	2516	2462	2462	she	147	" Would you like it , my dear ? It has always seemed to me rather a tiresome piece of gaiety rather a tiring day , I mean beginning so early and the heat , and all that . "
2517	2522	2524	2524	Molly	147	" Oh , papa ! "
2528	2539	2462	2462	she	147	" You 'd like to go then , would you ? "
2540	2567	2462	2462	she	147	" Yes ; if I may ! He asked me , you know . Do n't you think I may ? he asked me twice over . "

2627	2700	2605	2605	Molly	147	" That 's rather a puzzling speech . But I suppose you mean you do n't care to go , if it will be any trouble to get you there . I can easily manage it , however , so you may consider it settled . You 'll want a white frock , remember ; you 'd better tell Betty you 're going , and she 'll see after making you tidy . "

2984	3014	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" I was calling to see Nanny , and I took the opportunity of bringing Lady Agnes the plant I was telling her about as growing on Cumnor Moss . "
3015	3041	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" Thank you , so much , Mr. Gibson . Mamma , look ! this is the Drosera rotundifolia I have been wanting so long . "
3042	3202	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" Ah ! yes ; very pretty I daresay , only I am no botanist . Nanny is better , I hope ? We ca n't have any one laid up next week , for the house will be quite full of people , and here are the Danbys waiting to offer themselves as well . One comes down for a fortnight of quiet , at Whitsuntide , and leaves half one 's establishment in town , and as soon as people know of our being here , we get letters without end , longing for a breath of country air , or saying how lovely the Towers must look in spring ; and I must own , Lord Cumnor is a great deal to blame for it all , for as soon as ever we are down here , he rides about to all the neighbours , and invites them to come over and spend a few days . "
3203	3215	3217	3218	Lady Agnes	156	" We shall go back to town on Friday the 18th , "
3225	3253	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" Ah , yes ! as soon as we have got over the school visitors ' affair . But it is a week to that happy day . "
3254	3259	3261	3262	Mr. Gibson	238	" By the way ! "
3273	3323	3324	3324	He	238	" I met my lord at the Cross - trees Farm yesterday , and he was kind enough to ask my little daughter , who was with me , to be one of the party here on Thursday ; it would give the lassie great pleasure , I believe . "
3332	3393	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" Oh , well ! if my lord asked her , I suppose she must come , but I wish he was not so amazingly hospitable ! Not but what the little girl will be quite welcome ; only , you see , he met a younger Miss Browning the other day , of whose existence I had never heard . "
3394	3403	3405	3406	Lady Agnes	156	" She visits at the school , mamma , "
3408	3536	2950	2951	Lady Cumnor	150	" Well , perhaps she does ; I never said she did not . I knew there was one visitor of the name of Browning ; I never knew there were two , but , of course , as soon as Lord Cumnor heard there was another , he must needs ask her ; so the carriage will have to go backwards and forwards four times now to fetch them all . So your daughter can come quite easily , Mr. Gibson , and I shall be very glad to see her for your sake . She can sit bodkin with the Brownings , I suppose ? You 'll arrange it all with them ; and mind you get Nanny well up to her work next week . "
3551	3582	3545	3546	Lady Cumnor	150	" Oh ! by - the - by , Clare is here ; you remember Clare , do n't you ? She was a patient of yours , long ago . "
3583	3586	3587	3587	he	238	" Clare , "
3595	3609	3611	3612	Lady Agnes	156	" Do n't you recollect her ? Miss Clare , our old governess , "
3614	3628	3611	3612	Lady Agnes	156	" About twelve or fourteen years ago , before Lady Cuxhaven was married . "
3629	3634	3636	3636	he	238	" Oh , yes ! "
3638	3662	3636	3636	he	238	" Miss Clare , who had the scarlet fever here ; a very pretty delicate girl . But I thought she was married ! "
3663	3666	3668	3669	Lady Cumnor	150	" Yes ! "
3671	3786	3668	3669	Lady Cumnor	150	" She was a silly little thing , and did not know when she was well off ; we were all very fond of her , I 'm sure . She went and married a poor curate , and became a stupid Mrs. Kirkpatrick ; but we always kept on calling her ' Clare . ' And now he 's dead , and left her a widow , and she is staying here ; and we are racking our brains to find out some way of helping her to a livelihood without parting her from her child . She 's somewhere about the grounds , if you like to renew your acquaintance with her . "
3787	3827	3837	3837	he	700	" Thank you , my lady . I 'm afraid I can not stop to - day . I have a long round to go ; I 've stayed here too long as it is , I 'm afraid . "
3880	3910	3912	3913	Miss Browning	159	" Eh dear ! Mr. Gibson , but we shall be delighted to have her with us . You should never have thought of asking us such a thing , "
3917	3932	3934	3935	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm sure I 'm hardly sleeping at nights for thinking of it , "
3937	4007	3934	3935	Miss Phobe	159	" You know I 've never been there before . Sister has many a time ; but somehow , though my name has been down on the visitors ' list these three years , the countess has never named me in her note ; and you know I could not push myself into notice , and go to such a grand place without being asked ; how could I ? "
4008	4015	4017	4018	her sister	706	" I told Phobe last year , "
4020	4145	4017	4018	her sister	706	" that I was sure it was only inadvertence , as one may call it , on the part of the countess , and that her ladyship would be as hurt as any one when she did n't see Phobe among the school visitors ; but Phobe has got a delicate mind , you see , Mr. Gibson , and all I could say she would n't go , but stopped here at home ; and it spoilt all my pleasure all that day , I do assure you , to think of Phobe 's face , as I saw it over the window - blinds , as I rode away ; her eyes were full of tears , if you 'll believe me . "
4146	4159	4161	4162	Miss Phobe	159	" I had a good cry after you was gone , Dorothy , "
4164	4192	4161	4162	Miss Phobe	159	" but for all that , I think I was right in stopping away from where I was not asked . Do n't you , Mr. Gibson ? "
4193	4196	4198	4198	he	707	" Certainly , "
4200	4216	4198	4198	he	707	" And you see you are going this year ; and last year it rained . "
4217	4346	4161	4162	Miss Phobe	159	" Yes ! I remember ! I set myself to tidy my drawers , to string myself up , as it were ; and I was so taken up with what I was about that I was quite startled when I heard the rain beating against the window - panes . ' Goodness me ! ' said I to myself , ' whatever will become of sister 's white satin shoes , if she has to walk about on soppy grass after such rain as this ? ' for , you see , I thought a deal about her having a pair of smart shoes ; and this year she has gone and got me a white satin pair just as smart as hers , for a surprise . "
4347	4360	4362	4363	Miss Browning	159	" Molly will know she 's to put on her best clothes , "
4365	4383	4362	4363	Miss Browning	159	" We could perhaps lend her a few beads , or artificials , if she wants them . "
4384	4394	4396	4397	Mr. Gibson	238	" Molly must go in a clean white frock , "
4466	4481	4458	4458	she	159	" Oh ! very well . It 's quite right , I 'm sure . "
4487	4503	4483	4484	Miss Phobe	159	" Molly will look very nice in whatever she puts on , that 's certain . "
4989	5003	5004	5004	she	738	" They call that a perron , I believe , do n't they ? "
5016	5019	5011	5011	she	738	" hush . "
5398	5415	5387	5387	she	162	" May I go back , out into the garden ? I ca n't breathe here ! "
5416	5455	5387	5387	she	162	" Oh , yes , to be sure , love . I daresay it 's hard understanding for you , love ; but it 's very fine and instructive , and a deal of Latin in it too . "
5762	5787	5798	5798	she	762	" Poor little woman ! She has lost herself ; she belongs to some of the people from Hollingford , I have no doubt , "
5944	5978	5938	5938	she	762	" Poor little darling ! she is overcome by the heat , I have no doubt such a heavy straw bonnet , too . Let me untie it for you , my dear . "
5985	6000	5938	5938	she	762	" I am Molly Gibson , please . I came here with Miss Brownings ; "
6016	6020	6022	6023	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" Miss Brownings ? "
6032	6050	5938	5938	she	762	" I think they were the two tall large young women that Lady Agnes was talking about . "
6051	6068	6075	6075	she	162	" Oh , I daresay . I saw she had a number of people in tow ; "
6078	6106	6075	6075	she	162	" Have you had anything to eat , child , since you came ? You look a very white little thing ; or is it the heat ? "
6107	6115	6117	6117	Molly	147	" I have had nothing to eat , "
6172	6213	6162	6162	she	705	" Sit still here , my dear ; we are going to the house , and Clare shall bring you something to eat before you try to walk back ; it must be a quarter of a mile at least . "
6281	6289	6291	6291	she	778	" Look how kind Lady Cuxhaven is , "
6297	6346	6295	6295	Clare	256	" She chose you out this little lunch herself ; and now you must try and eat it , and you 'll be quite right when you 've had some food , darling You need not stop , Edwards ; I will bring the tray back with me . "
6441	6475	6437	6437	Clare	256	" Take some grapes , they will be the best for you ; you must try and eat something , or I do n't know how I shall get you to the house . "
6476	6482	6484	6484	Molly	147	" My head aches so , "
6492	6500	6502	6502	Clare	256	" Oh , dear , how tiresome ! "
6547	6603	6534	6534	Clare	256	" You see , I do n't know what to do with you here if you do n't eat enough to enable you to walk home . And I 've been out for these three hours trapesing about the grounds till I 'm as tired as can be , and missed my lunch and all . "
6618	6664	6615	6615	she	256	" You lie back in that seat for a few minutes , and try to eat the bunch of grapes , and I 'll wait for you , and just be eating a mouthful meanwhile . You are sure you do n't want this chicken ? "
6754	6766	6768	6768	she	256	" And now , darling , are you ready to go ? "
6780	6849	6768	6768	she	256	" Oh , come ; you have nearly finished your grapes ; that 's a good girl . Now , if you will come with me to the side entrance , I will take you up to my own room , and you shall lie down on the bed for an hour or two ; and if you have a good nap your headache will be quite gone . "
6892	6968	6987	6987	she	784	" was a flight of steps leading up from a private flower - garden into a private matted hall , or ante - room , out of which many doors opened , and in which were deposited the light garden - tools and the bows and arrows of the young ladies of the house . Lady Cuxhaven must have seen their approach , for she met them in this hall as soon as they came in .
6969	6975	6976	6976	she	784	" How is she now ? "
6990	7035	6987	6987	she	784	" Come , I think there ca n't be much amiss ! You 're a good old Clare , but you should have let one of the men fetch that tray in ; life in such weather as this is trouble enough of itself . "
7077	7118	7073	7073	She	147	" Poor dear ! she is not quite the thing yet ; has got a headache , she says . I am going to put her down on my bed , to see if she can get a little sleep . "
7132	7135	7137	7137	she	162	" Clare , "
7159	7168	7121	7122	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" Over - eaten herself , I suspect . "
7244	7279	7240	7240	herself	147	" Please , ma'am , do n't let them go away without me . Please ask somebody to waken me if I go to sleep . I am to go back with Miss Brownings . "
7280	7295	7297	7297	Clare	256	" Do n't trouble yourself about it , dear ; I 'll take care , "
7364	7383	7385	7386	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" Why not have both carriages out , mamma , and get rid of them all at once ? "
7388	7403	7385	7386	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" This going by instalments is the most tiresome thing that could be imagined . "

7492	7495	7526	7527	The housemaids	798	" omnibus . "
7589	7599	7566	7566	She	147	" Please , how soon are we going away ? "
7600	7640	7566	7566	She	147	" Bless us and save us ! who 'd ha ' thought of any one being in the bed ? Are you one of the Hollingford ladies , my dear ? They are all gone this hour or more ! "
7641	7681	7566	7566	She	147	" Oh , dear , what shall I do ? That lady they call Clare promised to waken me in time . Papa will so wonder where I am , and I do n't know what Betty will say . "
7751	7758	7739	7740	One housemaid	807	" Best leave it to her ; "
7786	7794	7795	7795	she	810	" Why , I quite forgot you ! "
7800	7868	7795	7795	she	810	" Nay , do n't cry ; you 'll make yourself not fit to be seen . Of course I must take the consequences of your over - sleeping yourself , and if I ca n't manage to get you back to Hollingford to - night , you shall sleep with me , and we 'll do our best to send you home to - morrow morning . "
7869	7873	7876	7876	Molly	147	" But papa ! "
7878	7897	7876	7876	Molly	147	" He always wants me to make tea for him ; and I have no night - things . "
7898	8063	7795	7795	she	810	" Well , do n't go and make a piece of work about what ca n't be helped now . I 'll lend you night - things , and your papa must do without your making tea for him to - night . And another time do n't over - sleep yourself in a strange house ; you may not always find yourself among such hospitable people as they are here . Why now , if you do n't cry and make a figure of yourself , I 'll ask if you may come in to dessert with Master Smythe and the little ladies . You shall go into the nursery , and have some tea with them ; and then you must come back here and brush your hair and make yourself tidy . I think it is a very fine thing for you to be stopping in such a grand house as this ; many a little girl would like nothing better . "
8125	8224	8249	8249	she	813	" I have a little girl of my own , dear ! I do n't know what she would not give to be staying here at Lord Cumnor 's with me ; but , instead of that , she has to spend her holidays at school ; and yet you are looking as miserable as can be at the thought of stopping for just one night . I really have been as busy as can be with those tiresome those good ladies , I mean , from Hollingford and one ca n't think of everything at a time . "
8254	8268	8249	8249	she	813	" Are you married , ma'am ; I thought she called you Clare ? "
8279	8334	8274	8275	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	816	" I do n't look as if I was married , do I ? Every one is surprised . And yet I have been a widow for seven months now : and not a grey hair on my head , though Lady Cuxhaven , who is younger than I , has ever so many . "
8335	8345	8347	8347	Molly	162	" Why do they call you ' Clare ? ' "
8356	8464	8274	8275	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	816	" Because I lived with them when I was Miss Clare . It is a pretty name , is n't it ? I married a Mr. Kirkpatrick ; he was only a curate , poor fellow ; but he was of a very good family , and if three of his relations had died without children I should have been a baronet 's wife . But Providence did not see fit to permit it ; and we must always resign ourselves to what is decreed . Two of his cousins married , and had large families ; and poor dear Kirkpatrick died , leaving me a widow . "
8465	8472	8474	8474	Molly	162	" You have a little girl ? "
8476	8719	8274	8275	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	816	" Yes : darling Cynthia ! I wish you could see her ; she is my only comfort now . If I have time I will show you her picture when we come up to bed ; but I must go now . It does not do to keep Lady Cumnor waiting a moment , and she asked me to be down early , to help with some of the people in the house . Now I shall ring this bell , and when the housemaid comes , ask her to take you into the nursery , and to tell Lady Cuxhaven 's nurse who you are . And then you 'll have tea with the little ladies , and come in with them to dessert . There ! I 'm sorry you 've over - slept yourself , and are left here ; but give me a kiss , and do n't cry you really are rather a pretty child , though you 've not got Cynthia 's colouring ! Oh , Nanny , would you be so very kind as to take this young lady what 's your name , my dear ? Gibson ? , Miss Gibson , to Mrs. Dyson , in the nursery , and ask her to allow her to drink tea with the young ladies there ; and to send her in with them to dessert . I 'll explain it all to my lady . "
8744	8748	8729	8729	she	155	" the doctor 's "
8850	8855	8857	8858	Mrs. Dyson	175	" Now , miss , "
8869	8888	8857	8858	Mrs. Dyson	175	" what can I do for you ? You have not got another frock here , have you ? "
8971	8977	8932	8933	the nurse	824	" going down to dessert , "
9075	9099	9105	9105	her	780	" Who is that tall girl in the thick white frock ? Not one of the children of the house , I think ? "
9119	9163	9105	9105	her	780	" A French girl , I should imagine . I know Lady Cuxhaven was inquiring for one to bring up with her little girls , that they might get a good accent early . Poor little woman , she looks wild and strange ! "
9220	9235	9208	9208	she	147	" I do n't understand French . I 'm only Molly Gibson , ma'am . "
9236	9240	9242	9243	the lady	780	" Molly Gibson ! "
9267	9272	9274	9274	he	153	" Oh , ho ! "
9276	9290	9274	9274	he	153	" Are you the little girl who has been sleeping in my bed ? "
9319	9323	9327	9327	his	153	" Three Bears , "
9652	9720	9641	9644	the awful Lady Cumnor	150	" Do you know , I thought this young lady was French when I first saw her ? she has got the black hair and eyelashes , and grey eyes , and colourless complexion which one meets with in some parts of France , and I know Lady Cuxhaven was trying to find a well - educated girl who would be a pleasant companion to her children . "
9721	9724	9726	9727	Lady Cumnor	150	" No ! "
9737	9827	9726	9727	Lady Cumnor	150	" She is the daughter of our medical man at Hollingford ; she came with the school visitors this morning , and she was overcome by the heat and fell asleep in Clare 's room , and somehow managed to over - sleep herself , and did not waken up till all the carriages were gone . We will send her home to - morrow morning , but for to - night she must stay here , and Clare is kind enough to say she may sleep with her . "

9977	10085	9938	9939	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	865	" Poor darling ! I saw you come into the dining - room , looking so shy ; and I wanted you to come near me , but I could not make a sign to you , because Lord Cuxhaven was speaking to me at the time , telling me about his travels . Ah , here is a nice book Lodge 's Portraits ; now I 'll sit by you and tell you who they all are , and all about them . Do n't trouble yourself any more , dear Lady Cuxhaven ; I 'll take charge of her ; pray leave her to me ! "

10573	10614	10567	10568	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	890	" You must go and wish Lady Cumnor good - night , you know , my dear , and thank her ladyship for her kindness to you . She is there , near that statue , talking to Mr. Courtenay . "
10645	10650	10652	10652	Molly	162	" Must I go ? "
10663	10682	10684	10685	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	891	" Yes ; make haste about it ; there is nothing so formidable in it , is there ? "
10735	10745	10730	10730	she	162	" Would you mind coming with me , please ? "
10746	10752	10754	10755	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	893	" No ! not I ! "
10807	10845	10796	10796	she	893	" Our little friend here is shy and modest , and wants me to accompany her to Lady Cumnor to wish good - night ; her father has come for her , and she is going away . "
10907	10948	10949	10949	she	893	" My lady , papa is come , and I am going away ; and , my lady , I wish you good - night , and thank you for your kindness . Your ladyship 's kindness , I mean , "
11026	11033	11035	11035	she	162	" all the rest of them , "
11076	11093	11096	11096	she	162	" Oh , papa , papa , papa ! I am so glad you have come ; "
11115	11208	11096	11096	she	162	" Why , what a noodle you are , Molly ! Did you think I was going to give up my little girl to live at the Towers all the rest of her life ? You make as much work about my coming for you , as if you thought I had . Make haste , now , and get on your bonnet . Mrs. Brown , may I ask you for a shawl , or a plaid , or a wrap of some kind to pin about her for a petticoat ? "

11558	11583	11551	11552	Mr. Gibson	238	" Molly ! we 're coming to the rabbit - holes ; it 's not safe to go at such a pace . Stop . "
11596	11616	11589	11589	he	238	" We 're getting into the shadow of the trees , and it 's not safe riding fast here . "
11617	11647	11680	11680	she	162	" Oh ! papa , I never was so glad in all my life . I felt like a lighted candle when they 're putting the extinguisher on it . "
11648	11660	11589	11589	he	238	" Did you ? How d'ye know what the candle feels ? "
11661	11673	11680	11680	she	162	" Oh , I do n't know , but I did . "
11683	11732	11680	11680	she	162	" Oh , I am so glad to be here ! It is so pleasant riding here in the open , free , fresh air , crushing out such a good smell from the dewy grass . Papa ! are you there ? I ca n't see you . "
11766	11777	11680	11680	she	162	" Oh ! I am so glad to feel you , "
11783	11860	11680	11680	she	162	" Papa , I should like to get a chain like Ponto 's , just as long as your longest round , and then I could fasten us two to each end of it , and when I wanted you I could pull , and if you did n't want to come , you could pull back again ; but I should know you knew I wanted you , and we could never lose each other . "
11861	11917	11680	11680	she	162	" I 'm rather lost in that plan of yours ; the details , as you state them , are a little puzzling ; but if I make them out rightly , I am to go about the country , like the donkeys on the common , with a clog fastened to my hind leg . "
11918	11936	11680	11680	she	162	" I do n't mind your calling me a clog , if only we were fastened together . "
11937	11948	11949	11949	he	923	" But I do mind you calling me a donkey , "
11952	11983	11680	11680	she	162	" I never did . At least I did n't mean to . But it is such a comfort to know that I may be as rude as I like . "
11984	12034	11680	11680	she	162	" Is that what you 've learnt from the grand company you 've been keeping to - day ? I expected to find you so polite and ceremonious , that I read a few chapters of Sir Charles Grandison , in order to bring myself up to concert pitch . "
12035	12051	11680	11680	she	162	" Oh , I do hope I shall never be a lord or a lady . "
12052	12100	11680	11680	she	162	" Well , to comfort you , I 'll tell you this : I 'm sure you 'll never be a lord ; and I think the chances are a thousand to one against your ever being the other , in the sense in which you mean . "
12101	12133	11680	11680	she	162	" I should lose myself every time I had to fetch my bonnet , or else get tired of long passages and great staircases long before I could go out walking . "
12134	12147	11680	11680	she	162	" But you 'd have your lady's - maid , you know . "
12148	12175	11680	11680	she	162	" Do you know , papa , I think lady's - maids are worse than ladies . I should not mind being a housekeeper so much . "
12176	12194	12196	12197	her father	675	" No ! the jam - cupboards and dessert would lie very conveniently to one 's hand , "
12201	12244	12196	12197	her father	675	" But Mrs. Brown tells me that the thought of the dinners often keeps her from sleeping ; there 's that anxiety to be taken into consideration . Still , in every condition of life , there are heavy cares and responsibilities . "
12245	12252	12254	12254	Molly	162	" Well ! I suppose so , "
12258	12285	12254	12254	Molly	162	" I know Betty says I wear her life out with the green stains I get in my frocks from sitting in the cherry - tree . "
12286	12334	11680	11680	she	162	" And Miss Browning said she had fretted herself into a headache with thinking how they had left you behind . I 'm afraid you 'll be as bad as a bill of fare to them to - night . How did it all happen , goosey ? "
12335	12458	12254	12254	Molly	162	" Oh , I went by myself to see the gardens ; they are so beautiful ! and I lost myself , and sat down to rest under a great tree ; and Lady Cuxhaven and that Mrs. Kirkpatrick came ; and Mrs. Kirkpatrick brought me some lunch , and then put me to sleep on her bed , and I thought she would waken me in time , and she did n't ; and so they 'd all gone away ; and when they planned for me to stop till to - morrow , I did n't like saying how very , very much I wanted to go home , but I kept thinking how you would wonder where I was . "
12459	12474	11680	11680	she	162	" Then it was rather a dismal day of pleasure , goosey , eh ? "
12475	12511	12254	12254	Molly	162	" Not in the morning . I shall never forget the morning in that garden . But I was never so unhappy in all my life , as I have been all this long afternoon . "

No one ever in all his life knew anything more of his antecedents than the Hollingford people might have found out the first day they saw him : that he was tall , grave , rather handsome than otherwise ; thin enough to be called "

Do n't teach Molly too much : she must sew , and read , and write , and do her sums ; but I want to keep her a child , and if I find more learning desirable for her , I 'll see about giving it to her myself . After all , I 'm not sure that reading or writing is necessary . Many a good woman gets married with only a cross instead of her name ; it 's rather a diluting of mother - wit , to my fancy ; but , however , we must yield to the prejudices of society , Miss Eyre , and so you may teach the child to read .

I 've made them sow all the seeds you like ; and I went over to Hollingford nursery to buy the cuttings of the plants you admired last year .

23314	23332	23269	23269	he	238	" He 'll not like Master Coxe outside ; no need to put him to unnecessary shame . "
23393	23432	23385	23385	he	238	" Oh ! by the way , here 's a letter for Mr. Coxe . Do n't send it through the women ; take it round yourself to the surgery - door , and do it at once . "
23528	23536	23540	23541	Mr. Wynne	206	" May I help you to potatoes ? "
23547	23555	23540	23541	Mr. Wynne	206	" May I assist you to potatoes ? "
23920	23929	23934	23934	himself	238	" He will have it , will he ? "
24017	24026	24028	24031	the invisible Mr. Coxe	207	" May I speak to you , sir ? "
24036	24066	24028	24031	the invisible Mr. Coxe	207	" To be sure . Come in , Mr. Coxe . I was rather wanting to talk to you about that bill of Corbyn 's . Pray sit down . "
24067	24095	24096	24096	He	238	" It is about nothing of that kind , sir , that I wanted that I wished No , thank you I would rather not sit down . "
24105	24122	24096	24096	He	238	" It is about that letter , sir that letter with the insulting prescription , sir . "
24123	24177	24028	24031	the invisible Mr. Coxe	207	" Insulting prescription ! I am surprised at such a word being applied to any prescription of mine though , to be sure , patients are sometimes offended at being told the nature of their illnesses ; and , I daresay , they may take offence at the medicines which their cases require . "
24178	24189	24096	24096	He	238	" I did not ask you to prescribe for me . "
24190	24229	24028	24031	the invisible Mr. Coxe	207	" Oh , ho ! Then you were the Master Coxe who sent the note through Bethia ! Let me tell you it has cost her her place , and was a very silly letter into the bargain . "
24230	24262	24096	24096	He	238	" It was not the conduct of a gentleman , sir , to intercept it , and to open it , and to read words never addressed to you , sir . "
24263	24266	24268	24269	Mr. Gibson	238	" No ! "
24293	24343	24282	24282	his	238	" I believe I was once considered tolerably good - looking , and I daresay I was as great a coxcomb as any one at twenty ; but I do n't think that even then I should quite have believed that all those pretty compliments were addressed to myself . "
24344	24356	24358	24359	Mr. Coxe	207	" It was not the conduct of a gentleman , sir , "
24380	24390	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" And let me tell you , young man , "
24403	24458	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" that what you have done is only excusable in consideration of your youth and extreme ignorance of what are considered the laws of domestic honour . I receive you into my house as a member of my family you induce one of my servants corrupting her with a bribe , I have no doubt "
24459	24471	24400	24400	his	238	" Indeed , sir ! I never gave her a penny . "
24472	24491	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" Then you ought to have done . You should always pay those who do your dirty work . "
24492	24506	24508	24509	Mr. Coxe	207	" Just now , sir , you called it corrupting with a bribe , "
24523	24556	24511	24512	Mr. Gibson	238	" Inducing one of my servants to risk her place , without offering her the slightest equivalent , by begging her to convey a letter clandestinely to my daughter a mere child . "
24557	24577	24579	24580	Mr. Coxe	207	" Miss Gibson , sir , is nearly seventeen ! I heard you say so only the other day , "
24592	24747	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" A letter which you were unwilling to have seen by her father , who had tacitly trusted to your honour , by receiving you as an inmate of his house . Your father 's son I know Major Coxe well ought to have come to me , and have said out openly , ' Mr. Gibson , I love or I fancy that I love your daughter ; I do not think it right to conceal this from you , although unable to earn a penny ; and with no prospect of an unassisted livelihood , even for myself , for several years , I shall not say a word about my feelings or fancied feelings to the very young lady herself . ' That is what your father 's son ought to have said ; if , indeed , a couple of grains of reticent silence would n't have been better still . "
24748	24765	24767	24768	Mr. Coxe	207	" And if I had said it , sir perhaps I ought to have said it , "
24776	24793	24767	24768	Mr. Coxe	207	" what would have been your answer ? Would you have sanctioned my passion , sir ? "
24794	24944	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" I would have said , most probably I will not be certain of my exact words in a suppositional case that you were a young fool , but not a dishonourable young fool , and I should have told you not to let your thoughts run upon a calf - love until you had magnified it into a passion . And I daresay , to make up for the mortification I should have given you , I might have prescribed your joining the Hollingford Cricket Club , and set you at liberty as often as I could on the Saturday afternoons . As it is , I must write to your father 's agent in London , and ask him to remove you out of my household , repaying the premium , of course , which will enable you to start afresh in some other doctor 's surgery . "
24945	24953	24955	24956	Mr. Coxe	207	" It will so grieve my father , "
24966	25022	24392	24393	Mr. Gibson	238	" I see no other course open . It will give Major Coxe some trouble I shall take care that he is at no extra expense , but what I think will grieve him the most is the betrayal of confidence ; for I trusted you , Edward , like a son of my own ! "
25085	25092	25094	25094	he	207	" I do love Miss Gibson , "
25099	25105	25094	25094	he	207	" Who could help it ? "
25106	25113	25115	25116	Mr. Gibson	238	" Mr. Wynne , I hope ! "
25118	25126	25128	25129	Mr. Coxe	207	" His heart is pre - engaged , "
25131	25142	25128	25129	Mr. Coxe	207	" Mine was free as air till I saw her . "
25143	25179	25094	25094	he	207	" Would it tend to cure your well ! passion , we 'll say if she wore blue spectacles at meal - times ? I observe you dwell much on the beauty of her eyes . "
25180	25200	25128	25129	Mr. Coxe	207	" You are ridiculing my feelings , Mr. Gibson . Do you forget that you yourself were young once ? "
25201	25204	25207	25208	Mr. Gibson	238	" Poor Jeanie "
25219	25236	25238	25238	he	238	" Come , Mr. Coxe , let us see if we ca n't make a bargain , "
25248	25418	25238	25238	he	238	" You have done a really wrong thing , and I hope you are convinced of it in your heart , or that you will be when the heat of this discussion is over , and you come to think a little about it . But I wo n't lose all respect for your father 's son . If you will give me your word that , as long as you remain a member of my family pupil , apprentice , what you will you wo n't again try to disclose your passion you see I am careful to take your view of what I should call a mere fancy by word or writing , looks or acts , in any manner whatever , to my daughter , or to talk about your feelings to any one else , you shall remain here . If you can not give me your word , I must follow out the course I named , and write to your father 's agent . "
25424	25447	25128	25129	Mr. Coxe	207	" Mr. Wynne knows all I feel for Miss Gibson , sir . He and I have no secrets from each other . "
25448	25584	25238	25238	he	238	" Well , I suppose he must represent the reeds . You know the story of King Midas 's barber , who found out that his royal master had the ears of an ass beneath his hyacinthine curls . So the barber , in default of a Mr. Wynne , went to the reeds that grew on the shores of a neighbouring lake , and whispered to them , ' King Midas has the ears of an ass . ' But he repeated it so often that the reeds learnt the words , and kept on saying them all day long , till at last the secret was no secret at all . If you keep on telling your tale to Mr. Wynne , are you sure he wo n't repeat it in his turn ? "
25585	25606	25128	25129	Mr. Coxe	207	" If I pledge my word as a gentleman , sir , I pledge it for Mr. Wynne as well . "
25607	25657	25238	25238	he	238	" I suppose I must run the risk . But remember how soon a young girl 's name may be breathed upon , and sullied . Molly has no mother , and for that very reason she ought to move among you all , as unharmed as Una herself . "
25658	25675	25677	25680	the excitable young man	1371	" Mr. Gibson , if you wish it , I 'll swear it on the Bible , "
25682	25711	25238	25238	he	238	" Nonsense . As if your word , if it 's worth anything , was n't enough ! We 'll shake hands upon it , if you like . "
25743	25753	25736	25736	he	207	" May I give Bethia a crown - piece ? "
25754	25793	25736	25736	he	207	" No , indeed ! Leave Bethia to me . I hope you wo n't say another word to her while she 's here . I shall see that she gets a respectable place when she goes away . "
26061	26097	26098	26098	he	238	" You may quote against me the proverb , ' He that will not when he may , when he will he shall have nay . ' And I shall have no reason to complain , "
26202	26214	26220	26220	her	205	" I only wish Osborne and Roger had been at home , "
26225	26263	26220	26220	her	205	" She may find it dull , being with old people , like the squire and me , from morning till night . When can she come ? the darling I am beginning to love her already ! "
26331	26343	26344	26344	he	238	" She knows nothing of the pleasure in store for her , "
26347	26384	26344	26344	he	238	" and I 'm sure I do n't know what feminine preparations she may think necessary , or how long they may take . You 'll remember she is a little ignoramus , and has had no "
26419	26419	26411	26411	her	1245	"
26496	26523	26493	26493	he	1206	" It 's as well the lads are at Cambridge ; we might have been having a love - affair if they had been at home . "
26524	26531	26533	26536	his more romantic wife	1410	" Well and if we had ? "
26538	26545	26547	26548	the Squire	1206	" It would n't have done , "
26552	26665	26547	26548	the Squire	1206	" Osborne will have had a first - rate education as good as any man in the county he 'll have this property , and he 's a Hamley of Hamley ; not a family in the shire is as old as we are , or settled on their ground so well . Osborne may marry where he likes . If Lord Hollingford had a daughter , Osborne would have been as good a match as she could have required . It would never do for him to fall in love with Gibson 's daughter I should n't allow it . So it 's as well he 's out of the way . "
26666	26676	26789	26790	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Well ! perhaps Osborne had better look higher . "
26677	26685	26686	26687	The Squire	1206	" Perhaps ! I say he must . "
26714	26720	26721	26721	he	1206	" And as for Roger , "
26734	26779	26721	26721	he	1206	" he 'll have to make his own way , and earn his own bread ; and , I 'm afraid , he 's not getting on very brilliantly at Cambridge . He must n't think of falling in love for these ten years . "
26780	26787	26789	26790	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Unless he marries a fortune , "
26813	26833	26835	26836	the Squire	1206	" No son of mine shall ever marry a wife who is richer than himself with my good will , "
26847	26936	26721	26721	he	1206	" I do n't say but what if Roger is gaining five hundred a year by the time he 's thirty , he shall not choose a wife with ten thousand pounds down ; but I do say , if a boy of mine , with only two hundred a year which is all Roger will have from us , and that not for a long time goes and marries a woman with fifty thousand to her portion , I 'll disown him it would be just disgusting . "
26937	26956	26959	26960	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Not if they loved each other , and their whole happiness depended upon their marrying each other , "
26964	27032	26959	26960	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Pooh ! away with love ! Nay , my dear , we loved each other so dearly we should never have been happy with any one else ; but that 's a different thing . People are n't like what they were when we were young . All the love nowadays is just silly fancy , and sentimental romance , as far as I can see . "
27078	27122	27075	27075	he	238	" By the way , Molly ! you 're to go to Hamley this afternoon ; Mrs. Hamley wants you to go to her for a week or two , and it suits me capitally that you should accept her invitation just now . "
27123	27184	27075	27075	he	238	" Go to Hamley ! This afternoon ! Papa , you 've got some odd reason at the back of your head some mystery , or something . Please , tell me what it is . Go to Hamley for a week or two ! Why , I never was from home before this without you in all my life . "
27185	27211	27075	27075	he	238	" Perhaps not . I do n't think you ever walked before you put your feet to the ground . Everything must have a beginning . "
27212	27246	27247	27247	She	1415	" It has something to do with that letter that was directed to me , but that you took out of my hands before I could even see the writing of the direction . "
27274	27282	27268	27268	He	675	" You 're a witch , goosey ! "
27283	27350	27260	27260	she	1415	" Then it had ! But if it was a note from Mrs. Hamley , why might I not see it ? I have been wondering if you had some plan in your head ever since that day . Thursday , was n't it ? You 've gone about in a kind of thoughtful , perplexed way , just like a conspirator . Tell me , papa "
27362	27384	27260	27260	she	1415	" why might n't I see that note ? and why am I to go to Hamley all on a sudden ? "
27385	27398	27400	27400	she	1415	" Do n't you like to go ? Would you rather not ? "
27453	27519	27449	27449	she	1415	" I do n't know I daresay I shall like it when I have thought a little more about it . Just now I 'm so startled by the suddenness of the affair , I have n't considered whether I shall like it or not . I sha n't like going away from you , I know . Why am I to go , papa ? "
27520	27677	27705	27705	his	238	" There are three old ladies sitting somewhere , and thinking about you just at this very minute ; one has a distaff in her hands , and is spinning a thread ; she has come to a knot in it , and is puzzled what to do with it . Her sister has a great pair of scissors in her hands , and wants as she always does , when any difficulty arises in the smoothness of the thread to cut it off short ; but the third , who has the most head of the three , plans how to undo the knot ; and she it is who has decided that you are to go to Hamley . The others are quite convinced by her arguments ; so , as the Fates have decreed that this visit is to be paid , there is nothing left for you and me but to submit . "
27678	27701	27449	27449	she	1415	" That 's all nonsense , papa , and you 're only making me more curious to find out this hidden reason . "
27713	27781	27705	27705	his	238	" There is a reason , Molly , and one which I do not wish to give . When I tell you this much , I expect you to be an honourable girl , and to try and not even conjecture what the reason may be , much less endeavour to put little discoveries together till very likely you may find out what I want to conceal . "
27782	27850	27449	27449	she	1415	" Papa , I wo n't even think about your reason again . But then I shall have to plague you with another question . I 've had no new gown this year , and I 've outgrown all my last summer frocks . I 've only three that I can wear at all . Betty was saying only yesterday that I ought to have some more . "
27851	27872	27705	27705	his	238	" That 'll do that you have got on , wo n't it ? It 's a very pretty colour . "
27873	27879	27449	27449	she	1415	" Yes ; but , papa "
27891	27913	27449	27449	she	1415	" it 's made of woollen , and so hot and heavy ; and every day it will be getting warmer . "
27914	27923	27925	27926	Mr. Gibson	238	" I wish girls could dress like boys , "
27933	27972	27925	27926	Mr. Gibson	238	" How is a man to know when his daughter wants clothes ? and how is he to rig her out when he finds it out , just when she needs them most and has n't got them ? "
27973	27981	27983	27983	Molly	147	" Ah , that 's the question ! "
27989	28013	27925	27926	Mr. Gibson	238	" Ca n't you go to Miss Rose 's ? Does n't she keep ready - made frocks for girls of your age ? "
28014	28028	28030	28030	Molly	147	" Miss Rose ! I never had anything from her in my life , "
28060	28264	27925	27926	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , but it seems people consider you as a young woman now , and so I suppose you must run up milliners ' bills like the rest of your kind . Not that you 're to get anything anywhere that you ca n't pay for down in ready money . Here 's a ten - pound note ; go to Miss Rose 's , or Miss anybody 's , and get what you want at once . The Hamley carriage is to come for you at two , and anything that is n't quite ready , can easily be sent by their cart on Saturday , when some of their people always come to market . Nay , do n't thank me ! I do n't want to have the money spent , and I do n't want you to go and leave me : I shall miss you , I know ; it 's only hard necessity that drives me to send you a - visiting , and to throw away ten pounds on your clothes . There , go away ; you 're a plague , and I mean to leave off loving you as fast as I can . "
28265	28268	28271	28271	her	1421	" Papa ! "
28277	28313	28271	28271	her	1421	" you 're getting mysterious again ; and though my honourableness is very strong , I wo n't promise that it shall not yield to my curiosity if you go on hinting at untold secrets . "
28314	28336	28271	28271	her	1421	" Go away and spend your ten pounds . What did I give it you for but to keep you quiet ? "
28590	28596	28598	28598	he	238	" And , after all , "
28600	28652	28598	28598	he	238	" I 'm only where I was when she comes back ; at least , if that foolish fellow goes on with his imaginating fancy . She 'll have to come back some time , and if he chooses to imagine himself constant , there 's still the devil to pay . "
28663	28667	28654	28654	he	238	" Beggar 's Opera "
28858	28901	28852	28852	he	238	" I 'm coming over to - morrow to see Mrs. Hamley ; and I daresay I shall dine at their lunch ; so you wo n't have to wait long before you 've the treat of seeing the wild beast feed . "
28909	28914	28916	28916	Molly	147	" Oh , papa , "
28923	28940	28916	28916	Molly	147	" I do so wish I was n't going , now that the time is come . "
28941	28965	28916	28916	Molly	147	" Nonsense ; do n't let us have any sentiment . Have you got your keys ? that 's more to the purpose . "
29519	29528	29530	29530	she	205	" I think we shall be great friends , "
29535	29558	29530	29530	she	205	" I like your face , and I am always guided by first impressions . Give me a kiss , my dear . "
29577	29590	29530	29530	she	205	" and Molly willingly kissed the sweet pale face held up to her .
29591	29626	29530	29530	she	205	" I meant to have gone and fetched you myself ; but the heat oppresses me , and I did not feel up to the exertion . I hope you had a pleasant drive ? "
29627	29630	29632	29632	Molly	147	" Very , "
29638	29677	29530	29530	she	205	" And now I will take you to your room ; I have had you put close to me ; I thought you would like it better , even though it was a smaller room than the other . "
30234	30268	30227	30228	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Shall we stay up here , my dear ? I think it is pleasanter than down below ; and then I shall not have to come upstairs again at dressing - time . "
30269	30277	30279	30279	Molly	147	" I shall like it very much , "
30281	30295	30297	30298	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Ah ! you 've got your sewing , like a good girl , "
30300	30356	30297	30298	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Now , I do n't sew much . I live alone a great deal . You see , both my boys are at Cambridge , and the squire is out of doors all day long so I have almost forgotten how to sew . I read a great deal . Do you like reading ? "
30357	30366	30368	30368	Molly	147	" It depends upon the kind of book , "
30370	30388	30368	30368	Molly	147	" I 'm afraid I do n't like ' steady reading , ' as papa calls it . "
30389	30395	30397	30398	Mrs. Hamley	205	" But you like poetry ! "
30404	30433	30397	30398	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I was sure you did , from your face . Have you read this last poem of Mrs. Hemans ? Shall I read it aloud to you ? "
30585	30623	30570	30571	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Ah ! I think I must read you some of Osborne 's poetry some day ; under seal of secrecy , remember ; but I really fancy they are almost as good as Mrs. Hemans ' . "
30668	30679	30661	30661	Molly	147	" Mr. Osborne Hamley ? Does your son write poetry ? "
30680	30754	30793	30794	The younger	1495	" Yes . I really think I may say he is a poet . He is a very brilliant , clever young man , and he quite hopes to get a fellowship at Trinity . He says he is sure to be high up among the wranglers , and that he expects to get one of the Chancellor 's medals . That is his likeness the one hanging against the wall behind you . "
30849	30855	30857	30857	Molly	147	" I like their faces ! "
30859	30889	30857	30857	Molly	147	" I suppose it is so long ago now , that I may speak of their likenesses to you as if they were somebody else ; may not I ? "
30890	30893	30901	30901	she	205	" Certainly , "
30907	30934	30895	30896	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Tell me just what you think of them , my dear ; it will amuse me to compare your impressions with what they really are . "
30935	30980	30901	30901	she	205	" Oh ! but I did not mean to guess at their characters . I could not do it ; and it would be impertinent , if I could . I can only speak about their faces as I see them in the picture . "
30981	30992	30895	30896	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Well ! tell me what you think of them ! "
30993	31038	30901	30901	she	205	" The eldest the reading boy is very beautiful ; but I ca n't quite make out his face yet , because his head is down , and I ca n't see the eyes . That is the Mr. Osborne Hamley who writes poetry . "
31039	31066	30895	30896	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Yes . He is not quite so handsome now ; but he was a beautiful boy . Roger was never to be compared with him . "
31067	31131	30901	30901	she	205	" No ; he is not handsome . And yet I like his face . I can see his eyes . They are grave and solemn - looking ; but all the rest of his face is rather merry than otherwise . It looks too steady and sober , too good a face , to go tempting his brother to leave his lesson . "
31132	31288	30895	30896	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Ah ! but it was not a lesson . I remember the painter , Mr. Green , once saw Osborne reading some poetry , while Roger was trying to persuade him to come out and have a ride in the hay - cart that was the ' motive ' of the picture , to speak artistically . Roger is not much of a reader ; at least , he does n't care for poetry , and books of romance , or sentiment . He is so fond of natural history ; and that takes him , like the squire , a great deal out of doors ; and when he is in , he is always reading scientific books that bear upon his pursuits . He is a good , steady fellow , though , and gives us great satisfaction , but he is not likely to have such a brilliant career as Osborne . "
31363	31375	31376	31376	she	147	" I am afraid they expect me to be very smart , "
31382	31407	31376	31376	she	147	" If they do , they 'll be disappointed ; that 's all . But I wish my plaid silk gown had been ready . "
31498	31507	31509	31509	Molly	147	" I do n't think I am pretty , "
31519	31527	31509	31509	Molly	147	" and yet I 'm not sure . "
31794	31842	31792	31792	he	199	" Why , God bless my soul , I 'd quite forgotten you ; you 're Miss Gibson , Gibson 's daughter , are n't you ? Come to pay us a visit ? I 'm sure I 'm very glad to see you , my dear . "
31880	31889	31891	31891	he	199	" I must go and dress , though , "
31899	31951	31891	31891	he	199	" Madam likes it . It 's one of her fine London ways , and she 's broken me into it at last . Very good plan , though , and quite right to make oneself fit for ladies ' society . Does your father dress for dinner , Miss Gibson ? "
32270	32286	32266	32266	he	1206	" To - morrow you 'll have to do this for me , Miss Gibson . "
32287	32305	32269	32269	Molly	147	" Shall I ? I 'll do it to - day , if you like , sir . "
32306	32342	32266	32266	he	1206	" No ; to - day I shall treat you as a visitor , with all proper ceremony . To - morrow I shall send you errands , and call you by your Christian name . "
32343	32349	32351	32351	Molly	147	" I shall like that , "
32353	32367	32369	32370	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I was wanting to call you something less formal than Miss Gibson , "
32372	32397	32266	32266	he	1206	" My name is Molly . It is an old - fashioned name , and I was christened Mary . But papa likes Molly . "
32398	32413	32266	32266	he	1206	" That 's right . Keep to the good old fashions , my dear . "
32414	32437	32439	32440	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Well , I must say I think Mary is prettier than Molly , and quite as old a name , too , "
32442	32448	32450	32450	Molly	147	" I think it was , "
32461	32476	32450	32450	Molly	147	" because mamma was Mary , and I was called Molly while she lived . "
32477	32483	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" Ah , poor thing , "
32499	32538	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" I remember how sorry every one was when she died ; no one thought she was delicate , she had such a fresh colour , till all at once she popped off , as one may say . "
32539	32551	32553	32554	Mrs. Hamley	205	" It must have been a terrible blow to your father , "
32566	32583	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" Ay , ay . It came so sudden , so soon after they were married . "
32584	32593	32595	32595	Molly	147	" I thought it was nearly four years , "
32597	32627	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" And four years is soon is a short time to a couple who look to spending their lifetime together . Every one thought Gibson would have married again . "
32628	32631	32633	32634	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Hush , "
32664	32711	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" Well I 'd perhaps better not have said it , but it 's the truth ; they did . He 's not likely to marry now , so one may say it out . Why , your father is past forty , is n't he ? "
32712	32728	32730	32730	Molly	147	" Forty - three . I do n't believe he ever thought of marrying again , "
32757	32798	32485	32486	the squire	1206	" No ! I do n't believe he did , my dear . He looks to me just like a man who would be constant to the memory of his wife . You must not mind what the squire says . "
32799	32827	32738	32738	one	6670	" Ah ! you 'd better go away , if you 're going to teach Miss Gibson such treason as that against the master of the house . "
32901	32910	32911	32911	she	147	" There is papa , with the Squire ! "
33105	33201	33076	33076	He	675	" So you do n't know my boys , even by sight . I should have thought you would have done , for they 're fond enough of riding into Hollingford ; and I know Roger has often enough been to borrow books from your father . Roger is a scientific sort of a fellow . Osborne is clever , like his mother . I should n't wonder if he published a book some day . You 're not counting right , Miss Gibson . Why , I could cheat you as easily as possible . "
33342	33352	33360	33360	she	147	" I think I shall be very happy here , "
33402	33409	33410	33410	she	147	" Who could he have married ? "
33414	33427	33410	33410	she	147	" Miss Eyre ? Miss Browning ? Miss Phobe ? Miss Goodenough ? "
33557	33562	33564	33564	he	1206	" on his manners , "
33664	33678	33687	33695	a troublesome Jack - in - the - box	1557	" Who was it that people thought it was possible papa might marry ? "
33794	33798	33769	33770	Squire Hamley	199	" the study . "
33921	33924	33942	33942	her	6795	" young gentlemen "
34105	34188	34065	34066	the Squire	1206	" It must be a little dull for you , my girl , all by yourself , with nothing but books to look at , in the mornings here ; but you see , madam has a fancy for being quiet in the mornings : she told your father about it , and so did I , but I felt sorry for you all the same , when I saw you sitting on the ground all alone in the drawing - room . "
34275	34277	34264	34264	him	1206	" Ravenswood "
34279	34283	34262	34262	Molly	147	" Lucy Ashton . "
34371	34389	34390	34390	She	147	" Who did people think papa would marry ? That time long ago soon after mamma died ? "
34444	34447	34449	34449	he	1206	" Whew , "
34506	34574	34639	34639	Molly	147	" I never heard of any one his name was never coupled with any lady 's ' twas only in the nature of things that he should marry again ; he may do it yet , for aught I know , and I do n't think it would be a bad move either . I told him so , the last time but one he was here . "
34575	34582	34584	34585	breathless Molly	147	" And what did he say ? "
34587	34638	34639	34639	Molly	147	" Oh : he only smiled and said nothing . You should n't take up words so seriously , my dear . Very likely he may never think of marrying again , and if he did , it would be a very good thing both for him and for you ! "
34673	34678	34679	34679	he	1206	" Look at that ! "
34730	34787	35278	35279	the squire	1206	" We must get you punted over there , some of these days . I 'm not fond of using the boat at this time of the year , because the young birds are still in the nests among the reeds and water - plants ; but we 'll go . There are coots and grebes . "
34788	34798	35278	35279	the squire	1206	" Oh , look , there 's a swan ! "
34799	34874	35278	35279	the squire	1206	" Yes ; there are two pair of them here . And in those trees there 's both a rookery and a heronry ; the herons ought to be here by now , for they 're off to the sea in August , but I 've not seen one yet . Stay ! is n't that one that fellow on a stone , with his long neck bent down , looking into the water ? "
34875	34894	35278	35279	the squire	1206	" Yes ! I think so . I have never seen a heron , only pictures of them . "
34895	35078	35094	35094	he	1609	" They and the rooks are always at war , which does n't do for such near neighbours . If both herons leave the nest they are building , the rooks come and tear it to pieces ; and once Roger showed me a long straggling fellow of a heron , with a flight of rooks after him , with no friendly purpose in their minds , I 'll be bound . Roger knows a deal of natural history , and finds out queer things sometimes . He 'd have been off a dozen times during this walk of ours , if he 'd been here : his eyes are always wandering about , and see twenty things where I only see one . Why ! I 've known him bolt into a copse because he saw something fifteen yards off some plant , maybe , which he 'd tell me was very rare , though I should say I 'd seen its marrow at every turn in the woods ; and , if we came upon such a thing as this , "
35097	35170	35094	35094	he	1609	" why , he could tell you what insect or spider made it , and if it lived in rotten fir - wood , or in a cranny of good sound timber , or deep down in the ground , or up in the sky , or anywhere . It 's a pity they do n't take honours in Natural History at Cambridge . Roger would be safe enough if they did . "
35171	35183	35184	35184	Molly	147	" Mr. Osborne Hamley is very clever , is he not ? "
35189	35276	35278	35279	the squire	1206	" Oh , yes . Osborne 's a bit of a genius . His mother looks for great things from Osborne . I 'm rather proud of him myself . He 'll get a Trinity fellowship , if they play him fair . As I was saying at the magistrates ' meeting yesterday , ' I 've got a son who will make a noise at Cambridge , or I 'm very much mistaken . ' Now , is n't it a queer quip of Nature , "
35301	35330	35290	35290	he	1206	" that I , a Hamley of Hamley , straight in descent from nobody knows where the Heptarchy , they say What 's the date of the Heptarchy ? "
35331	35337	35339	35339	Molly	147	" I do n't know , "
35348	35672	35673	35673	He	1611	" Well ! it was some time before King Alfred , because he was the King of all England , you know ; but , as I was saying , here am I , of as good and as old a descent as any man in England , and I doubt if a stranger , to look at me , would take me for a gentleman , with my red face , great hands and feet , and thick figure , fourteen stone , and never less than twelve even when I was a young man ; and there 's Osborne , who takes after his mother , who could n't tell her great - grandfather from Adam , bless her ; and Osborne has a girl 's delicate face , and a slight make , and hands and feet as small as a lady 's . He takes after madam 's side , who , as I said , ca n't tell who was her grandfather . Now , Roger is like me , a Hamley of Hamley , and no one who sees him in the street will ever think that red - brown , big - boned , clumsy chap is of gentle blood . Yet all those Cumnor people , you make such ado of in Hollingford , are mere muck of yesterday . I was talking to madam the other day about Osborne 's marrying a daughter of Lord Hollingford 's that 's to say , if he had a daughter he 's only got boys , as it happens ; but I 'm not sure if I should consent to it . I really am not sure ; for you see Osborne will have had a first - rate education , and his family dates from the Heptarchy , while I should be glad to know where the Cumnor folk were in the time of Queen Anne ? "
35715	35742	35711	35711	he	1611	" No ! I 'm sure I should have looked higher . So , perhaps , it 's as well my Lord Hollingford has only boys . "
35825	35835	35837	35837	he	1611	" That 's a nice girl of Gibson 's , "
35841	35909	35837	35837	he	1611	" But what a tight hold the wench got of the notion of his marrying again ! One had need be on one 's guard as to what one says before her . To think of her never having thought of the chance of a stepmother . To be sure , a stepmother to a girl is a different thing to a second wife to a man ! "
35991	35993	35961	35963	a cunning hussy	1617	" trifle "
36041	36046	36027	36027	she	1618	" been sent packing , "
36398	36404	36406	36407	Mr. Gibson	238	" To be sure not , "
36431	36458	36461	36461	he	238	" I wish I 'd a five - pound house and not a woman within ten miles of me . I might have some peace then . "
36514	36524	36525	36525	he	238	" Molly must stay a little longer at Hamley , "
36528	36616	36525	36525	he	238	" They 've often asked for her , and now they 'll have enough of her , I think . But I ca n't have her back here just yet ; and so the best I can do for her is to leave her where she is . Mrs. Hamley seems very fond of her , and the child is looking happy , and stronger in health . I 'll ride round by Hamley to - day at any rate , and see how the land lies . "
36669	36676	36677	36677	she	147	" Oh ! here 's papa ! "
36714	36726	36732	36732	herself	205	" Come in come here through the drawing - room window , "
36737	36764	36732	36732	herself	205	" We 've got a rose - tree to show you that Molly has budded all by herself . We are both so proud of it . "
36873	36886	36887	36887	he	238	" I 've come here to - day to ask a favour , "
36890	36904	36860	36860	her	147	" Granted before you name it . Am not I a bold woman ? "
36918	36969	36860	36860	her	147	" Miss Eyre , who has been Molly 's governess , I suppose I must call her for many years , writes to - day to say that one of the little nephews she took with her to Newport while Molly was staying here , has caught the scarlet fever . "
36970	37013	37029	37029	Molly	147	" I guess your request . I make it before you do . I beg for dear little Molly to stay on here . Of course Miss Eyre ca n't come back to you ; and of course Molly must stay here ! "
37014	37028	36860	36860	her	147	" Thank you ; thank you very much . That was my request . "
37045	37088	37029	37029	Molly	147	" Papa ! Mrs. Hamley ! I know you 'll both understand me but may n't I go home ? I am very happy here ; but oh papa ! I think I should like to be at home with you best . "
37175	37246	37169	37169	he	1645	" Molly , you 're rude to begin with . I do n't know how you 're to make your peace with Mrs. Hamley , I 'm sure . And in the next place , do you think you 're wiser than I am ; or that I do n't want you at home , if all other things were conformable ? Stay where you are , and be thankful . "
37325	37369	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I was going to have asked for a longer visit the next time you came , Mr. Gibson . We are such happy friends , are not we , Molly ? and now , that this good little nephew of Miss Eyre 's "
37370	37377	37379	37380	Mr. Gibson	238	" I wish he was whipped , "
37382	37448	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" has given us such a capital reason , I shall keep Molly for a real long visitation . You must come over and see us very often . There 's a room here for you always , you know ; and I do n't see why you should not start on your rounds from Hamley every morning , just as well as from Hollingford . "
37449	37480	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Thank you . If you had n't been so kind to my little girl , I might be tempted to say something rude in answer to your last speech . "
37481	37501	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Pray say it . You wo n't be easy till you have given it out , I know . "
37502	37515	37517	37517	Molly	147	" Mrs. Hamley has found out from whom I get my rudeness , "
37521	37528	37517	37517	Molly	147	" It 's an hereditary quality . "
37529	37598	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I was going to say that proposal of yours that I should sleep at Hamley was just like a woman 's idea all kindness , and no common sense . How in the world would my patients find me out , seven miles from my accustomed place ? They 'd be sure to send for some other doctor , and I should be ruined in a month . "
37599	37613	37517	37517	Molly	147	" Could n't they send on here ? A messenger costs very little . "
37614	37677	37308	37309	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Fancy old Goody Henbury struggling up to my surgery , groaning at every step , and then being told to just step on seven miles farther ! Or take the other end of society : I do n't think my Lady Cumnor 's smart groom would thank me for having to ride on to Hamley every time his mistress wants me . "
37678	37743	37517	37517	Molly	147	" Well , well , I submit . I am a woman . Molly , thou art a woman ! Go and order some strawberries and cream for this father of yours . Such humble offices fall within the province of women . Strawberries and cream are all kindness and no common sense , for they 'll give him a horrid fit of indigestion . "
37744	37753	37755	37755	Molly	147	" Please speak for yourself , Mrs. Hamley , "
37759	37820	37755	37755	Molly	147	" I ate oh , such a great basketful yesterday , and the squire went himself to the dairy and brought out a great bowl of cream , when he found me at my busy work . And I 'm as well as ever I was , to - day , and never had a touch of indigestion near me . "
37821	37828	37834	37834	she	147	" She 's a good girl , "
37881	37973	37870	37870	he	675	" She 's a darling . I can not tell you how fond the Squire and I are of her ; both of us . I am so delighted to think she is n't to go away for a long time . The first thing I thought of this morning when I wakened up , was that she would soon have to return to you , unless I could persuade you into leaving her with me a little longer . And now she must stay oh , two months at least . "
38119	38129	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Stay longer ! Did Gibson ask for it ? "
38130	38178	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Yes ! I do n't see what else is to become of her ; Miss Eyre away and all . It 's a very awkward position for a motherless girl like her to be at the head of a household with two young men in it . "
38179	38207	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" That 's Gibson 's look - out ; he should have thought of it before taking pupils , or apprentices , or whatever he calls them . "
38208	38247	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" My dear Squire ! why , I thought you 'd be as glad as I was as I am to keep Molly . I asked her to stay for an indefinite time ; two months at least . "
38248	38267	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" And to be in the house with Osborne ! Roger , too , will be at home . "
38283	38332	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Oh , she 's not at all the sort of girl young men of their age would take to . We like her because we see what she really is ; but lads of one or two and twenty want all the accessories of a young woman . "
38333	38337	38339	38340	the Squire	1206	" Want what ? "
38342	38374	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Such things as becoming dress , style of manner . They would not at their age even see that she is pretty ; their ideas of beauty would include colour . "
38375	38475	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I suppose all that 's very clever ; but I do n't understand it . All I know is , that it 's a very dangerous thing to shut two young men of one and three and twenty up in a country - house like this with a girl of seventeen choose what her gowns may be like , or her hair , or her eyes . And I told you particularly I did n't want Osborne , or either of them , indeed , to be falling in love with her . I 'm very much annoyed . "
38488	38521	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Shall we make arrangements for their stopping away while she is here ; staying up at Cambridge , or reading with some one ? going abroad for a month or two ? "
38522	38574	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" No ; you 've been reckoning this ever so long on their coming home . I 've seen the marks of the weeks on your almanack . I 'd sooner speak to Gibson , and tell him he must take his daughter away , for it 's not convenient to us "
38575	38625	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" My dear Roger ! I beg you will do no such thing . It will be so unkind ; it will give the lie to all I said yesterday . Do n't , please , do that . For my sake , do n't speak to Mr. Gibson ! "
38626	38639	38641	38641	he	1657	" Well , well , do n't put yourself in a flutter , "
38649	38673	38641	38641	he	1657	" I 'll speak to Osborne when he comes home , and tell him how much I should dislike anything of the kind . "
38674	38717	38277	38278	Mrs. Hamley	205	" And Roger is always far too full of his natural history and comparative anatomy , and messes of that sort , to be thinking of falling in love with Venus herself . He has not the sentiment and imagination of Osborne . "
38718	38758	38784	38784	she	147	" Ah , you do n't know ; you never can be sure about a young man ! But with Roger it would n't so much signify . He would know he could n't marry for years to come . "
38873	38876	38894	38895	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Fortunate ! "
38877	38882	38894	38895	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Yes ! very ! "
38960	38970	38955	38955	Molly	147	" Oh , dear ! I am so sorry ! "
38988	39009	38971	38972	Mrs. Hamley	205	" You have been thinking so long of his coming home . I am afraid it is a great disappointment . "
39015	39102	39010	39011	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Yes ! it is a disappointment certainly , but we must think of Osborne 's pleasure . And with his poetical mind , he will write us such delightful travelling letters . Poor fellow ! he must be going into the examination to - day ! Both his father and I feel sure , though , that he will be a high wrangler . Only I should like to have seen him , my own dear boy . But it is best as it is . "
39696	39761	39686	39686	she	6795	" Not but what they were as clean as could be beforehand ; but mistress would always have the young gentlemen 's rooms cleaned afresh before they came home . If it had been Mr. Osborne , the whole house would have had to be done ; but , to be sure , he was the eldest son , so it was but likely . "
39795	39800	39776	39776	she	147	" the eldest son . "
40078	40082	40032	40032	her	147	" moated grange ; "
40431	40438	40427	40428	the Squire	1206	" Hallo ! here he is , "
40632	40638	40640	40640	she	205	" It 's only Osborne , "
40645	40654	40640	40640	she	205	" Roger has been telling us about him . "
40655	40660	40662	40662	Molly	147	" What about him ? "
40666	40807	40614	40614	She	205	" I knew on Monday ; we had a letter he said he had not done so well as we had hoped as he had hoped himself , poor fellow ! He said he had just passed , but was only low down among the junior optimes , and not where he had expected , and had led us to expect . But the Squire has never been at college , and does not understand college terms , and he has been asking Roger all about it , and Roger has been telling him , and it has made him so angry . But the squire hates college slang ; he has never been there , you know ; and he thought poor Osborne was taking it too lightly , and he has been asking Roger about it , and Roger "
40822	40859	40818	40818	Molly	147	" I do n't think Mr. Roger should have told ; he had no need to begin so soon about his brother 's failure . Why , he has n't been in the house an hour ! "
40860	40867	40869	40870	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Hush , hush , love ! "
40872	41099	40869	40870	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Roger is so good . You do n't understand . The squire would begin and ask questions before Roger had tasted food as soon as ever we had got into the dining - room . And all he said to me , at any rate was that Osborne was nervous , and that if he could only have gone in for the Chancellor 's medals , he would have carried all before him . But Roger said that after failing like this , he is not very likely to get a fellowship , which the Squire had placed his hopes on . Osborne himself seemed so sure of it , that the squire ca n't understand it , and is seriously angry , and growing more so the more he talks about it . He has kept it in two or three days , and that never suits him . He is always better when he is angry about a thing at once , and does n't let it smoulder in his mind . Poor , poor Osborne ! I did wish he had been coming straight home , instead of going to these friends of his ; I thought I could have comforted him . But now I 'm glad , for it will be better to let his father 's anger cool first . "
41132	41212	41118	41118	she	205	" You 're a real blessing to mothers , child ! You give one such pleasant sympathy , both in one 's gladness and in one 's sorrow ; in one 's pride for I was so proud last week , so confident , and in one 's disappointment . And now your being a fourth at dinner will keep us off that sore subject ; there are times when a stranger in the household is a wonderful help . "
41673	41684	41693	41693	Molly	147	" from grave to gay , from lively to severe , "
41713	41720	41710	41710	he	203	" heavy - looking , clumsy , "
41722	41735	41710	41710	he	203	" a person she was sure she should never get on with . "
42097	42110	42083	42083	he	1206	" Bring up a bottle of the Burgundy with the yellow seal . "
42148	42175	42134	42134	Molly	147	" If you please , sir , there are not above six bottles of that seal left ; and it is Mr. Osborne 's favourite wine . "
42187	42204	42184	42184	his	1206	" Bring up a bottle of the Burgundy with the yellow seal , as I said . "
42211	42215	42205	42206	The butler	1541	" Mr. Osborne 's "
42953	42962	42947	42947	her	147	" When may I come home , papa ? "
43503	43510	43512	43513	Lady Cumnor	150	" Thursday the 19th , Harriet , "
43517	43591	43512	43513	Lady Cumnor	150	" what do you say to coming down to the Towers on the 18th , and helping me over that long day . You could stay in the country till Monday , and have a few days ' rest and good air ; you would return a great deal fresher to the remainder of your gaieties . Your father would bring you down , I know : indeed , he is coming naturally . "
43592	43597	43599	43600	Lady Harriet	168	" Oh , mamma ! "
43615	43700	43599	43600	Lady Harriet	168	" I can not go ; there 's the water - party up to Maidenhead on the 20th , I should be so sorry to miss it : and Mrs. Duncan 's ball , and Grisi 's concert ; please , do n't want me . Besides , I should do no good . I ca n't make provincial small - talk ; I 'm not up in the local politics of Hollingford . I should be making mischief , I know I should . "
43701	43708	43710	43711	Lady Cumnor	150	" Very well , my dear , "
43715	43733	43710	43711	Lady Cumnor	150	" I had forgotten the Maidenhead water - party , or I would not have asked you . "
43734	43838	43512	43513	Lady Cumnor	150	" What a pity it is n't the Eton holidays , so that you could have had Hollingford 's boys to help you to do the honours , mamma . They are such affable little prigs . It was the greatest fun to watch them last year at Sir Edward 's , doing the honours of their grandfather 's house to much such a collection of humble admirers as you get together at the Towers . I shall never forget seeing Edgar gravely squiring about an old lady in a portentous black bonnet , and giving her information in the correctest grammar possible . "
43839	43847	43849	43850	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" Well , I like those lads , "
43852	43918	43849	43850	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" they are on the way to become true gentlemen . But , mamma , why should n't you have Clare to stay with you ? You like her , and she is just the person to save you the troubles of hospitality to the Hollingford people , and we should all be so much more comfortable if we knew you had her with you . "
43919	43928	43930	43931	Lady Cumnor	150	" Yes , Clare would do very well , "
43933	44036	43930	43931	Lady Cumnor	150	" but is n't it her school - time or something ? We must not interfere with her school so as to injure her , for I am afraid she is not doing too well as it is ; and she has been so very unlucky ever since she left us first her husband died , and then she lost Lady Davies ' situation , and then Mrs. Maude 's , and now Mr. Preston told your father it was all she could do to pay her way in Ashcombe , though Lord Cumnor lets her have the house rent - free . "
44037	44046	44048	44049	Lady Harriet	168	" I ca n't think how it is , "
44051	44097	44048	44049	Lady Harriet	168	" She 's not very wise , certainly ; but she is so useful and agreeable , and has such pleasant manners , I should have thought any one who was n't particular about education would have been charmed to keep her as a governess . "
44098	44124	44126	44127	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" What do you mean by not being particular about education ? Most people who keep governesses for their children are supposed to be particular , "
44129	44168	44048	44049	Lady Harriet	168	" Well , they think themselves so , I 've no doubt ; but I call you particular , Mary , and I do n't think mamma was ; but she thought herself so , I 'm sure . "
44169	44180	44182	44183	Lady Cumnor	150	" I ca n't think what you mean , Harriet , "
44201	44429	44048	44049	Lady Harriet	168	" Oh dear , mamma , you did everything you could think of for us ; but you see you 'd ever so many other engrossing interests , and Mary hardly ever allows her love for her husband to interfere with her all - absorbing care for the children . You gave us the best of masters in every department , and Clare to dragonize and keep us up to our preparation for them , as well as ever she could ; but then you know , or rather you did n't know , some of the masters admired our very pretty governess , and there was a kind of respectable veiled flirtation going on , which never came to anything , to be sure ; and then you were often so overwhelmed with your business as a great lady fashionable and benevolent , and all that sort of thing that you used to call Clare away from us at the most critical times of our lessons , to write your notes , or add up your accounts , and the consequence is , that I 'm about the most ill - informed girl in London . Only Mary was so capitally trained by good awkward Miss Benson , that she is always full to overflowing with accurate knowledge , and her glory is reflected upon me . "
44430	44442	44444	44445	Lady Cumnor	150	" Do you think what Harriet says is true , Mary ? "
44450	44503	44504	44505	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" I was so little with Clare in the school - room . I used to read French with her ; she had a beautiful accent , I remember . Both Agnes and Harriet were very fond of her . I used to be jealous for Miss Benson 's sake , and perhaps "
44509	44609	44048	44049	Lady Harriet	168	" that made me fancy that she had a way of flattering and indulging them not quite conscientious , I used to think . But girls are severe judges , and certainly she had had an anxious enough lifetime . I am always so glad when we can have her , and give her a little pleasure . The only thing that makes me uneasy now is the way in which she seems to send her daughter away from her so much ; we never can persuade her to bring Cynthia with her when she comes to see us . "
44610	44619	44621	44622	Lady Harriet	168	" Now that I call ill - natured , "
44624	44703	44621	44622	Lady Harriet	168	" here is a poor dear woman trying to earn her livelihood , first as a governess , and what could she do with her daughter then , but send her to school ? and after that , when Clare is asked to go visiting , and is too modest to bring her girl with her besides all the expense of the journey , and the rigging out Mary finds fault with her for her modesty and economy . "
44704	44756	44621	44622	Lady Harriet	168	" Well , after all , we are not discussing Clare and her affairs , but trying to plan for mamma 's comfort . I do n't see that she can do better than ask Mrs. Kirkpatrick to come to the Towers as soon as her holidays begin , I mean . "
44757	44764	44766	44767	Lady Cumnor	150	" Here is her last letter , "
44797	44935	44792	44792	she	150	" ' My wonted misfortunes appear to have followed me to Ashcombe ' um , um , um ; that 's not it ' Mr. Preston is most kind in sending me fruit and flowers from the Manor - house , according to dear Lord Cumnor 's kind injunction . ' Oh , here it is ! ' The vacation begins on the 11th , according to the usual custom of schools in Ashcombe ; and I must then try and obtain some change of air and scene , in order to fit myself for the resumption of my duties on the 10th of August . ' You see , girls , she would be at liberty , if she has not made any other arrangement for spending her holidays . To - day is the 15th . "
44936	44947	44948	44949	Lady Harriet	168	" I 'll write to her at once , mamma , "
44952	44992	44948	44949	Lady Harriet	168	" Clare and I are always great friends ; I was her confidant in her loves with poor Mr. Kirkpatrick , and we 've kept up our intimacy ever since . I know of three offers she had besides . "
44993	45028	45030	45031	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" I sincerely hope Miss Bowes is not telling her love - affairs to Grace or Lily . Why , Harriet , you could not have been older than Grace when Clare was married ! "
45037	45096	44948	44949	Lady Harriet	168	" No ; but I was well versed in the tender passion , thanks to novels . Now I daresay you do n't admit novels into your school - room , Mary ; so your daughters would n't be able to administer discreet sympathy to their governess in case she was the heroine of a love - affair . "
45097	45126	45185	45185	my	0	" My dear Harriet , do n't let me hear you talking of love in that way ; it is not pretty . Love is a serious thing . "
45127	45162	44948	44949	Lady Harriet	168	" My dear mamma , your exhortations are just eighteen years too late . I 've talked all the freshness off love , and that 's the reason I 'm tired of the subject . "
45222	45266	45217	45217	she	162	" Do ask the poor little daughter to come with her mother to the Towers ; why , she must be seventeen or more ; she would really be a companion to you , mamma , if her mother was unable to come . "
45267	45286	45288	45289	Lady Harriet	168	" I was not ten when Clare married , and I 'm nearly nine - and - twenty , "
45291	45337	45217	45217	she	162	" Do n't speak of it , Harriet ; at any rate you are but eight - and - twenty now , and you look a great deal younger . There is no need to be always bringing up your age on every possible occasion . "
45338	45369	45217	45217	she	162	" There was need of it now , though . I wanted to make out how old Cynthia Kirkpatrick was . I think she ca n't be far from eighteen . "
45370	45543	45217	45217	she	162	" She is at school at Boulogne , I know ; and so I do n't think she can be as old as that . Clare says something about her in this letter : ' Under these circumstances ' the ill - success of her school , ' I can not think myself justified in allowing myself the pleasure of having darling Cynthia at home for the holidays ; especially as the period when the vacation in French schools commences differs from that common in England ; and it might occasion some confusion in my arrangements if darling Cynthia were to come to Ashcombe , and occupy my time and thoughts so immediately before the commencement of my scholastic duties as the 8th of August , on which day her vacation begins , which is but two days before my holidays end . ' So , you see , Clare would be quite at liberty to come to me , and I daresay it would be a very nice change for her . "
45544	45614	45217	45217	she	162	" And Hollingford is busy seeing after his new laboratory at the Towers , and is constantly backwards and forwards . And Agnes wants to go there for change of air , as soon as she is strong enough after her confinement . And even my own dear insatiable ' me ' will have had enough of gaiety in two or three weeks , if this hot weather lasts . "
45615	45670	45217	45217	she	162	" I think I may be able to come down for a few days too , if you will let me , mamma ; and I 'll bring Grace , who is looking rather pale and weedy ; growing too fast , I 'm afraid . So I hope you wo n't be dull . "
45671	45675	45677	45678	Lady Cumnor	150	" My dear , "
45684	45704	45677	45678	Lady Cumnor	150	" I should be ashamed of feeling dull with my resources ; my duties to others and to myself ! "
45800	45913	45957	45958	my lady	690	" Very good very good , indeed ! Clare to join you at the Towers ! Capital ! I could n't have planned it better myself ! I shall go down with you on Wednesday in time for the jollification on Thursday . I always enjoy that day ; they are such nice , friendly people , those good Hollingford ladies . Then I 'll have a day with Sheepshanks , and perhaps I may ride over to Ashcombe and see Preston Brown Jess can do it in a day , eighteen miles to be sure ! But there 's back again to the Towers ! how much is twice eighteen thirty ? "
45914	45919	45921	45922	Lady Cumnor	150	" Thirty - six , "
45926	45947	45957	45958	my lady	690	" So it is ; you 're always right , my dear . Preston 's a clever , sharp fellow . "
45948	45955	45957	45958	my lady	690	" I do n't like him , "
45960	45992	45957	45958	my lady	690	" He takes looking after ; but he 's a sharp fellow . He 's such a good - looking man , too , I wonder you do n't like him . "
45993	46021	45957	45958	my lady	690	" I never think whether a land - agent is handsome or not . They do n't belong to the class of people whose appearance I notice . "
46022	46092	45957	45958	my lady	690	" To be sure not . But he is a handsome fellow ; and what should make you like him is the interest he takes in Clare and her prospects . He is constantly suggesting something that can be done to her house , and I know he sends her fruit , and flowers , and game just as regularly as we should ourselves if we lived at Ashcombe . "
46093	46099	46101	46102	Lady Cumnor	150	" How old is he ? "
46114	46171	45957	45958	my lady	690	" About twenty - seven , I think . Ah ! I see what is in your ladyship 's head . No ! no ! he 's too young for that . You must look out for some middle - aged man , if you want to get poor Clare married ; Preston wo n't do . "
46172	46205	46207	46207	she	150	" I 'm not a match - maker , as you might know . I never did it for my own daughters . I 'm not likely to do it for Clare , "
46213	46313	45957	45958	my lady	690	" Well ! you might do a worse thing . I 'm beginning to think she 'll never get on as a schoolmistress , though why she should n't , I 'm sure I do n't know ; for she 's an uncommonly pretty woman for her age , and her having lived in our family , and your having had her so often with you , ought to go a good way . I say , my lady , what do you think of Gibson ? He would be just the right age widower lives near the Towers ? "
46314	46348	46379	46380	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1838	" I told you just now I was no match - maker , my lord . I suppose we had better go by the old road the people at those inns know us ? "
46473	46477	46440	46440	she	1838	" dear Lady Cumnor "
47340	47658	47317	47317	She	1838	" One would think it was an easy enough thing to deck a looking - glass like that with muslin and pink ribbons ; and yet how hard it is to keep it up ! People do n't know how hard it is till they 've tried as I have . I made my own glass just as pretty when I first went to Ashcombe ; but the muslin got dirty , and the pink ribbons faded , and it is so difficult to earn money to renew them ; and when one has got the money one has n't the heart to spend it all at once . One thinks and one thinks how one can get the most good out of it ; and a new gown , or a day 's pleasure , or some hot - house fruit , or some piece of elegance that can be seen and noticed in one 's drawing - room , carries the day , and good - by to prettily decked looking - glasses . Now here , money is like the air they breathe . No one even asks or knows how much the washing costs , or what pink ribbon is a yard . Ah ! it would be different if they had to earn every penny as I have ! They would have to calculate , like me , how to get the most pleasure out of it . I wonder if I am to go on all my life toiling and moiling for money ? It 's not natural . Marriage is the natural thing ; then the husband has all that kind of dirty work to do , and his wife sits in the drawing - room like a lady . I did , when poor Kirkpatrick was alive . Heigho ! it 's a sad thing to be a widow . "
47891	47894	47895	47895	She	1869	" collation . "
47957	47963	47965	47965	her	1869	" With the utmost condescension , "
48055	48067	48068	48068	he	1223	" I 'm afraid you 're sadly tired , my lady ? "
48084	48099	48078	48078	herself	1869	" When I am tired , Lord Cumnor , I will tell you so . "
48250	48290	48244	48244	His	1223	" It 's such a comfort to leave my lady to you ; only do n't you be deluded by her ways . She 'll not show she 's ill till she ca n't help it . Consult with Bradley "

48306	48310	48299	48299	she	256	" lady's - maid "
48312	48336	48299	48299	she	256	" and if I were you , I 'd send and ask Gibson to call you might make any kind of a pretence , "
48368	48431	48362	48362	he	1223	" Get him to come and see you , he 's a very agreeable man ; Lord Hollingford says there 's no one like him in these parts : and he might be looking at my lady while he was talking to you , and see if he thinks her really ill . And let me know what he says about her . "
48532	48536	48537	48537	she	256	" Mrs. Bradley , "
48542	48564	48537	48537	she	256	" are you quite comfortable about my lady 's health ? Lord Cumnor fancied that she was looking worn and ill ? "
48565	48605	48515	48515	her	256	" Indeed , Mrs. Kirkpatrick , I do n't think my lady is herself . I ca n't persuade myself as she is , though if you was to question me till night I could n't tell you why . "
48606	48643	48537	48537	she	256	" Do n't you think you could make some errand to Hollingford , and see Mr. Gibson , and ask him to come round this way some day , and make a call on Lady Cumnor ? "
48644	48705	48515	48515	her	256	" It would be as much as my place is worth , Mrs. Kirkpatrick . Till my lady 's dying day , if Providence keeps her in her senses , she 'll have everything done her own way , or not at all . There 's only Lady Harriet that can manage her the least , and she not always . "
48706	48743	48537	48537	she	256	" Well , then we must hope that there is nothing the matter with her ; and I daresay there is not . She says there is not , and she ought to know best herself . "
48765	48812	48755	48756	Lady Cumnor	150	" Clare , I wish you 'd write a note to Mr. Gibson , saying I should like to see him this afternoon . I thought he would have called of himself before now . He ought to have done so , to pay his respects . "
48901	48903	48913	48913	he	238	" rows "
48998	49031	48993	48994	Lord Hollingford	188	" Gibson , I wonder if you 'd give me some lunch ; I 've been a good deal about since my seven - o'clock breakfast , and am getting quite ravenous . "
49293	49333	49290	49290	he	238	" You see a man like me a widower with a daughter who can not always be at home has not the regulated household which would enable me to command the small portions of time I can spend there . "
49370	49403	49366	49366	he	238	" True , true . Yet a man like you ought to be free from any thought of household cares . You ought to have somebody . How old is Miss Gibson ? "
49404	49418	49290	49290	he	238	" Seventeen . It 's a very awkward age for a motherless girl . "
49419	49554	49366	49366	he	238	" Yes ; very . I have only boys , but it must be very awkward with a girl . Excuse me , Gibson , but we 're talking like friends . Have you never thought of marrying again ? It would n't be like a first marriage , of course ; but if you found a sensible , agreeable woman of thirty or so , I really think you could n't do better than take her to manage your home , and so save you either discomfort or worry ; and , besides , she would be able to give your daughter that kind of tender supervision which , I fancy , all girls of that age require . It 's a delicate subject , but you 'll excuse my having spoken frankly . "
49575	49581	49555	49556	Mr. Gibson	238	" first catch your hare . "
49595	49655	49555	49556	Mr. Gibson	238	" Not Miss Browning , nor Miss Phobe , nor Miss Goodenough . Among his country patients there were two classes pretty distinctly marked : farmers , whose children were unrefined and uneducated ; squires , whose daughters would , indeed , think the world was coming to a pretty pass , if they were to marry a country surgeon .
49682	49685	49678	49679	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1916	" hare . "
50319	50328	50308	50308	she	1951	" who always managed my lady so beautifully . "
50448	50453	50439	50439	herself	150	" that good Clare . "
50549	50560	50547	50547	her	690	" Clare was a good creature , but not clever , "
50582	50609	50565	50565	she	690	" Read on . What are you stopping for ? There is no bad news , is there , about Agnes ? Give me the letter . "
50617	50673	50610	50611	Lady Cumnor	150	" ' How are Clare and Gibson getting on ? You despised my advice to help on that affair , but I really think a little match - making would be a very pleasant amusement now that you are shut up in the house ; and I can not conceive any marriage more suitable . ' "
50674	50677	50679	50680	Lady Cumnor	150	" Oh ! "
50684	50714	50679	50680	Lady Cumnor	150	" it was awkward for you to come upon that , Clare : I do n't wonder you stopped short . You gave me a terrible fright , though . "
50715	50724	50726	50727	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1960	" Lord Cumnor is so fond of joking , "
50743	50753	50726	50727	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1960	" I can not conceive any marriage more suitable . "
50969	50973	50975	50975	he	1964	" Very good , "
50991	51006	50975	50975	he	1964	" can I speak to you for a minute or two in the library ? "
51007	51014	51016	51016	she	150	" Is he going to offer ? "
51313	51320	51322	51322	he	238	" It 's very stormy weather , "
51324	51349	51518	51519	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , very . My daughter writes me word , that for two days last week the packet could not sail from Boulogne . "
51350	51360	51518	51519	Mr. Gibson	238	" Miss Kirkpatrick is at Boulogne , is she ? "
51361	51446	51518	51519	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , poor girl ; she is at school there , trying to perfect herself in the French language . But , Mr. Gibson , you must not call her Miss Kirkpatrick . Cynthia remembers you with so much affection , I may say . She was your little patient when she had the measles here four years ago , you know . Pray call her Cynthia ; she would be quite hurt at such a formal name as Miss Kirkpatrick from you . "
51447	51473	51518	51519	Mr. Gibson	238	" Cynthia seems to me such an out - of - the - way name , only fit for poetry , not for daily use . "
51474	51479	51481	51482	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1977	" It is mine , "
51491	51517	51481	51482	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1977	" I was christened Hyacinth , and her poor father would have her called after me . I 'm sorry you do n't like it . "
51548	51574	51545	51545	she	1977	" Hyacinth Clare ! Once upon a time I was quite proud of my pretty name ; and other people thought it pretty , too . "
51575	51580	51581	51582	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 've no doubt "
51589	51656	51545	51545	she	1977	" Perhaps I did wrong in yielding to his wish , to have her called by such a romantic name . It may excite prejudice against her in some people ; and , poor child ! she will have enough to struggle with . A young daughter is a great charge , Mr. Gibson , especially when there is only one parent to look after her . "
51657	51663	51665	51665	he	238	" You are quite right , "
51674	51713	51665	51665	he	238	" though I should have thought that a girl who is so fortunate as to have a mother could not feel the loss of her father so acutely as one who is motherless must suffer from her deprivation . "
51714	51780	51545	51545	she	1977	" You are thinking of your own daughter . It was careless of me to say what I did . Dear child ! how well I remember her sweet little face as she lay sleeping on my bed . I suppose she is nearly grown - up now . She must be near my Cynthia 's age . How I should like to see her ! "
51781	51812	51813	51813	He	1978	" I hope you will . I should like you to see her . I should like you to love my poor little Molly , to love her as your own "
51829	51839	51840	51840	she	1979	" Is he going to offer ? Is he ? "
51856	51889	51852	51852	he	1978	" Could you love her as your daughter ? Will you try ? Will you give me the right of introducing you to her as her future mother ; as my wife ? "
51940	51946	51947	51947	she	1979	" Oh ! Mr. Gibson , "
51992	51998	52000	52000	he	1978	" My dear my dearest , "
52044	52078	52036	52036	herself	1979	" Call me Hyacinth your own Hyacinth . I ca n't bear ' Clare , ' it does so remind me of being a governess , and those days are all past now . "
52079	52104	52036	52036	herself	1979	" Yes ; but surely no one can have been more valued , more beloved than you have been in this family at least . "
52105	52128	52036	52036	herself	1979	" Oh , yes ! they have been very good . But still one has always had to remember one 's position . "
52129	52137	52139	52139	he	1978	" We ought to tell Lady Cumnor , "
52173	52183	52185	52185	she	1980	" You 'll tell her , wo n't you ? "
52196	52217	52185	52185	she	1980	" I always like other people to tell her things , and then I can see how she takes them . "
52218	52239	52139	52139	he	1978	" Certainly ! I will do whatever you wish . Shall we go and see if she is awake now ? "
52240	52271	52185	52185	she	1980	" No ! I think not . I had better prepare her . You will come to - morrow , wo n't you ? and you will tell her then . "
52272	52306	52139	52139	he	1978	" Yes ; that will be best . I ought to tell Molly first . She has the right to know . I do hope you and she will love each other dearly . "
52307	52336	52185	52185	she	1980	" Oh , yes ! I 'm sure we shall . Then you 'll come to - morrow and tell Lady Cumnor ? And I 'll prepare her . "
52337	52366	52139	52139	he	1978	" I do n't see what preparation is necessary ; but you know best , my dear . When can we arrange for you and Molly to meet ? "
52380	52393	52414	52414	she	1985	" Her ladyship is awake , and wishes to see Mr. Gibson . "
52417	52420	52414	52414	she	1985	" to prepare "
52494	52534	52562	52562	He	238	" I 'm glad you 're not gone , Mr. Gibson . I wanted to tell you What 's the matter with you both ? What have you been saying to Clare ? I 'm sure something has happened . "
52580	52617	52562	52562	He	238	" I have been asking Mrs. Kirkpatrick to be my wife , and to be a mother to my child ; and she has consented . I hardly know how to thank her enough in words . "
52618	52654	52660	52660	she	150	" Umph ! I do n't see any objection . I daresay you 'll be very happy . I 'm very glad of it ! Here ! shake hands with me , both of you . "
52663	52680	52660	52660	she	150	" It does not seem to me that any exertion has been required on my part . "
52693	52923	52689	52690	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	1989	" Did she not tell you ? Oh , then , I must . It 's too good a joke to be lost , especially as everything has ended so well . When Lord Cumnor 's letter came this morning this very morning I gave it to Clare to read aloud to me , and I saw she suddenly came to a full stop , where no full stop could be , and I thought it was something about Agnes , so I took the letter and read stay ! I 'll read the sentence to you . Where 's the letter , Clare ? Oh ! do n't trouble yourself , here it is . ' How are Clare and Gibson getting on ? You despised my advice to help on that affair , but I really think a little match - making would be a very pleasant amusement , now that you are shut up in the house ; and I can not conceive any marriage more suitable . ' You see , you have my lord 's full approbation . But I must write , and tell him you have managed your own affairs without any interference of mine . Now we 'll just have a little medical talk , Mr. Gibson , and then you and Clare shall finish your tete - a - tete . "
53005	53070	52996	52997	Lady Cumnor	150	" Come , no nonsense . I always made my girls go and have tete - a - tetes with the men who were to be their husbands , whether they would or no : there 's a great deal to be talked over before every marriage , and you two are certainly old enough to be above affectation . Go away with you . "
53125	53156	53119	53119	She	150	" I can not tell what poor Kirkpatrick would say if he knew what I have done . He did so dislike the notion of second marriages , poor fellow ! "
53157	53198	53119	53119	She	150	" Let us hope that he does n't know , then ; or that , if he does , he is wiser I mean , that he sees how second marriages may be most desirable and expedient in some cases . "
53246	53261	53263	53263	he	238	" We shall shake down into uniformity before long , I 've no doubt , "
53272	53298	53299	53299	he	238	" It 's hardly to be expected that our thoughts should run in the same groove all at once . Nor should I like it , "
53302	53359	53299	53299	he	238	" It would be very flat and stagnant to have only an echo of one 's own opinions from one 's wife . Heigho ! I must tell Molly about it : dear little woman , I wonder how she 'll take it ? It 's done , in a great measure , for her good . "
53840	53843	53845	53845	he	675	" Molly ! "
53866	53869	53845	53845	he	675	" Molly ! "
53907	53936	53893	53893	she	162	" Oh , papa , my dear , dear papa ! What made you come while I was asleep ? I lose the pleasure of watching for you . "
53980	54042	53975	53975	she	162	" I was up so early ! It is so charming to be out here in the fresh morning air . I think that made me sleepy . But is n't it a gloriously hot day ? I wonder if the Italian skies they talk about can be bluer than that that little bit you see just between the oaks there ! "
54084	54139	54075	54075	She	162	" Have you heard from Miss Eyre , papa ? How are they all ? And this fever that is about ? Do you know , papa , I do n't think you are looking well ? You want me at home to take care of you . How soon may I come home ? "
54140	54181	54185	54185	he	2018	" Do n't I look well ? That must be all your fancy , goosey . I feel uncommonly well ; and I ought to look well , for I have a piece of news for you , little woman . "
54201	54207	54194	54194	he	2018	" Can you guess it ? "
54208	54213	54215	54215	she	2019	" How should I ? "
54237	54246	54248	54248	he	2018	" Why , you see , my love , "
54255	54297	54248	54248	he	2018	" that you are in a very awkward position a girl growing up in such a family as mine young men which was a piece of confounded stupidity on my part . And I am obliged to be away so much . "
54298	54305	54307	54307	she	2019	" But there is Miss Eyre , "
54321	54334	54307	54307	she	2019	" Dear Miss Eyre , I want nothing but her and you . "
54335	54393	54248	54248	he	2018	" Still there are times like the present when Miss Eyre can not be with you ; her home is not with us ; she has other duties . I 've been in great perplexity for some time ; but at last I 've taken a step which will , I hope , make us both happier . "
54394	54403	54405	54405	she	2019	" You 're going to be married again , "
54426	54459	54248	54248	he	2018	" Yes . To Mrs. Kirkpatrick you remember her ? They call her Clare at the Towers . You recollect how kind she was to you that day you were left there ? "
54647	54749	54628	54628	He	238	" She 's a very suitable age for me . I do n't know how old she is exactly , but she must be nearly forty . I should n't have wished to marry any one younger . She 's highly respected by Lord and Lady Cumnor and their family , which is of itself a character . She has very agreeable and polished manners of course , from the circles she has been thrown into and you and I , goosey , are apt to be a little brusque , or so ; we must brush up our manners now . "
54765	54842	54761	54761	He	238	" She has been accustomed to housekeeping economical housekeeping , too for of late years she has had a school at Ashcombe , and has had , of course , to arrange all things for a large family . And last , but not least , she has a daughter about your age , Molly who , of course , will come and live with us , and be a nice companion a sister for you . "
54853	54873	54850	54850	she	2023	" So I was sent out of the house that all this might be quietly arranged in my absence ? "
54945	54966	54967	54967	He	675	" Oh , papa , papa I 'm not myself I do n't know what to say about this hateful detestable "
54998	55090	54988	54988	he	675	" I think it 's better for both of us , for me to go away now . We may say things difficult to forget . We are both much agitated . By to - morrow we shall be more composed ; you will have thought it over , and have seen that the principal one great motive , I mean was your good . You may tell Mrs. Hamley I meant to have told her myself . I will come again to - morrow . Good - by , Molly . "
56167	56181	56158	56159	Miss Gibson	174	" Oh , papa , papa ! if you would but come back ! "
56353	56360	56362	56362	she	174	" Is it lunch - time ? "
56397	56473	56497	56497	She	174	" I do n't know . I was going home to lunch . But you must let me say it I could n't go on when I saw your distress . Has anything happened ? anything in which I can help you , I mean ; for , of course , I 've no right to make the inquiry , if it is any private sorrow , in which I can be of no use . "
56520	56525	56527	56527	he	2086	" Wait a moment , "
56596	56600	56601	56601	she	174	" Thank you ! "
56604	56620	56601	56601	she	174	" I can walk back now , in a short time . Do n't stop . "
56621	56627	56629	56629	he	2086	" You must let me , "
56631	56652	56629	56629	he	2086	" my mother would n't like me to leave you to come home alone , while you are so faint . "
56696	56705	56707	56707	she	174	" Papa is going to be married again , "
56824	56831	56832	56832	She	174	" You are sorry for it ? "
56849	56852	56843	56843	her	174	" Yes , "
56936	56972	56921	56921	he	2086	" It seems as if there might be cases where setting the question of love entirely on one side it must be almost a duty to find some one to be a substitute for the mother "
56977	56994	56927	56927	he	2086	" said he , in a different tone of voice , and looking at Molly afresh , "
57022	57022	57018	57020	a pleasant companion	2089	"
57023	57047	57048	57048	she	174	" He had me . You do n't know what we were to each other at least , what he was to me , "
57053	57089	57048	57048	she	174	" Still he must have thought it for the best , or he would n't have done it . He may have thought it the best for your sake even more than for his own . "
57090	57101	57048	57048	she	174	" That is what he tried to convince me of . "
57127	57288	57123	57123	he	203	" I want to tell you of a girl I know . Her mother died when she was about sixteen the eldest of a large family . From that time all through the bloom of her youth she gave herself up to her father , first as his comforter , afterwards as his companion , friend , secretary anything you like . He was a man with a great deal of business on hand , and often came home only to set to afresh to preparations for the next day 's work . Harriet was always there , ready to help , to talk , or to be silent . It went on for eight or ten years in this way ; and then her father married again , a woman not many years older than Harriet herself . Well they are just the happiest set of people I know you would n't have thought it likely , would you ? "
57339	57344	57345	57345	she	2090	" How was it ? "
57351	57366	57367	57367	Roger	203	" Harriet thought of her father 's happiness before she thought of her own , "
57389	57397	57381	57381	She	162	" If it were for papa 's happiness "
57398	57514	57367	57367	Roger	203	" He must believe that it is . Whatever you fancy , give him a chance . He can not have much comfort , I should think , if he sees you fretting or pining , you who have been so much to him , as you say . The lady herself , too if Harriet 's stepmother had been a selfish woman , and been always clutching after the gratification of her own wishes ; but she was not : she was as anxious for Harriet to be happy as Harriet was for her father and your father 's future wife may be another of the same kind , though such people are rare . "
57515	57525	57527	57527	Molly	162	" I do n't think she is , though , "
57642	57738	57739	57739	He	203	" It is right to hope for the best about everybody , and not to expect the worst . This sounds like a truism , but it has comforted me before now , and some day you 'll find it useful . One has always to try to think more of others than of oneself , and it is best not to prejudge people on the bad side . My sermons are n't long , are they ? Have they given you an appetite for lunch ? Sermons always make me hungry , I know . "
57931	57939	57940	57940	he	203	" You will have thought me hard , "
57961	58060	57940	57940	he	203	" I never can manage to express what I feel somehow I always fall to philosophizing but I am sorry for you . Yes , I am ; it 's beyond my power to help you , as far as altering facts goes , but I can feel for you , in a way which it 's best not to talk about , for it can do no good . Remember how sorry I am for you ! I shall often be thinking of you , though I daresay it 's best not to talk about it again . "
58064	58071	58073	58073	her	2099	" I know you are sorry , "
58189	58207	58209	58209	she	964	" Where have you been , Roger ? Where is Molly ? Miss Gibson , I mean , "
58235	58279	58209	58209	she	964	" I 've been out dredging . By the way , I left my net on the terrace walk . I found Miss Gibson sitting there , crying as if her heart would break . Her father is going to be married again . "
58280	58290	58370	58370	his	2111	" Married again ! You do n't say so . "
58291	58340	58209	58209	she	964	" Yes , he is ; and she takes it very hardly , poor girl . Mother , I think if you could send some one to her with a glass of wine , a cup of tea , or something of that sort she was very nearly fainting "
58341	58352	58354	58355	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I 'll go to her myself , poor child , "
58359	58365	58367	58367	he	2111	" Indeed you must not , "
58376	58397	58398	58398	he	2111	" We have kept you waiting already too long ; you are looking quite pale . Hammond can take it , "
58415	58423	58209	58209	she	964	" Whom is he going to marry ? "
58424	58442	58370	58370	his	2111	" I do n't know . I did n't ask , and she did n't tell me . "
58443	58474	58209	58209	she	964	" That 's so like a man . Why , half the character of the affair lies in the question of who it is that he is going to marry . "
58475	58516	58370	58370	his	2111	" I daresay I ought to have asked . But somehow I 'm not a good one on such occasions . I was as sorry as could be for her , and yet I could n't tell what to say . "
58517	58523	58209	58209	she	964	" What did you say ? "
58524	58535	58370	58370	his	2111	" I gave her the best advice in my power . "
58536	58550	58209	58209	she	964	" Advice ! you ought to have comforted her . Poor little Molly ! "
58551	58565	58370	58370	his	2111	" I think that if advice is good it 's the best comfort . "
58566	58582	58209	58209	she	964	" That depends on what you mean by advice . Hush ! here she is . "
58707	58730	58694	58694	she	205	" So I hear your father is going to be married , my dear ? May I ask whom it is to ? "
58731	58775	58776	58776	Molly	162	" Mrs. Kirkpatrick . I think she was governess a long time ago at the Countess of Cumnor 's . She stays with them a great deal , and they call her Clare , and I believe they are very fond of her . "
58793	58825	58776	58776	Molly	162	" I think I 've heard of her . Then she 's not very young ? That 's as it should be . A widow too . Has she any family ? "
58826	58841	58776	58776	Molly	162	" One girl , I believe . But I know so little about her ! "
58849	58877	58842	58842	Molly	162	" Never mind , my dear . That will all come in good time . Roger , you 've hardly eaten anything ; where are you going ? "
58878	58910	58842	58842	Molly	162	" To fetch my dredging - net . It 's full of things I do n't want to lose . Besides , I never eat much , as a general thing . "
58983	59001	58980	58980	she	162	" He was so good to me . I mean to try and remember all he said . "
59002	59058	58980	58980	she	162	" I 'm glad to hear it , love ; very glad . From what he told me , I was afraid he had been giving you a little lecture . He has a good heart , but he is n't so tender in his manner as Osborne . Roger is a little rough sometimes . "
59059	59091	59099	59100	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Then I like roughness . It did me good . It made me feel how badly oh , Mrs. Hamley , I did behave so badly to papa this morning ! "
59508	59561	59491	59491	he	203	" There , there , that will do . I know all you want to say . I know my little Molly my silly little goosey better than she knows herself . I 've brought you an invitation . Lady Cumnor wants you to go and spend next Thursday at the Towers ! "
59562	59570	59572	59572	she	162	" Do you wish me to go ? "
59578	59595	59491	59491	he	203	" I wish you and Hyacinth to become better acquainted to learn to love each other . "
59596	59599	59601	59601	Molly	162	" Hyacinth ! "
59606	59675	59714	59714	he	2126	" Yes ; Hyacinth ! It 's the silliest name I ever heard of ; but it 's hers , and I must call her by it . I ca n't bear Clare , which is what my lady and all the family at the Towers call her ; and ' Mrs. Kirkpatrick ' is formal and nonsensical too , as she 'll change her name so soon . "
59676	59681	59683	59683	Molly	162	" When , papa ? "
59698	59704	59714	59714	he	2126	" Not till after Michaelmas . "
59717	59770	59714	59714	he	2126	" And the worst is , she 's gone and perpetuated her own affected name by having her daughter called after her . Cynthia ! One thinks of the moon , and the man in the moon with his bundle of faggots . I 'm thankful you 're plain Molly , child . "
59771	59781	59714	59714	he	2126	" How old is she Cynthia , I mean ? "
59782	59857	59714	59714	he	2126	" Ay , get accustomed to the name . I should think Cynthia Kirkpatrick was about as old as you are . She 's at school in France , picking up airs and graces . She 's to come home for the wedding , so you 'll be able to get acquainted with her then ; though , I think , she 's to go back again for another half - year or so . "
60273	60334	60255	60256	Lady Cumnor	150	" Of course you ca n't give up your school all at once , Clare . The wedding ca n't be before Christmas , but that will do very well . We shall all be down at the Towers ; and it will be a nice amusement for the children to go over to Ashcombe , and see you married . "
60335	60361	60564	60565	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2146	" I think I am afraid I do n't believe Mr. Gibson will like waiting so long ; men are so impatient under these circumstances . "
60362	60436	60255	60256	Lady Cumnor	150	" Oh , nonsense ! Lord Cumnor has recommended you to his tenants , and I 'm sure he would n't like them to be put to any inconvenience . Mr. Gibson will see that in a moment . He 's a man of sense , or else he would n't be our family doctor . Now , what are you going to do about your little girl ? Have you fixed yet ? "
60437	60495	60564	60565	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2146	" No . Yesterday there seemed so little time , and when one is agitated it is so difficult to think of anything . Cynthia is nearly eighteen , old enough to go out as a governess , if he wishes it , but I do n't think he will . He is so generous and kind . "
60496	60548	60564	60565	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2146	" Well ! I must give you time to settle some of your affairs to - day . Do n't waste it in sentiment , you 're too old for that . Come to a clear understanding with each other ; it will be for your happiness in the long run . "
60697	60754	60680	60680	she	2146	" I can hardly tell you what a comfort and relief it will be to me , Hyacinth , when you are once my wife the mistress of my home poor little Molly 's mother and protector ; but I would n't interfere with your previous engagements for the world . It would n't be right . "
60755	60804	60680	60680	she	2146	" Thank you , my own love . How good you are ! So many men would think only of their own wishes and interests ! I 'm sure the parents of my dear pupils will admire you will be quite surprised at your consideration for their interests . "
60805	60843	60680	60680	she	2146	" Do n't tell them , then . I hate being admired . Why should n't you say it is your wish to keep on your school till they 've had time to look out for another ? "
60844	60850	60852	60852	she	2152	" Because it is n't , "
60857	61048	60852	60852	she	2152	" I long to be making you happy ; I want to make your home a place of rest and comfort to you ; and I do so wish to cherish your sweet Molly , as I hope to do , when I come to be her mother . I ca n't take virtue to myself which does n't belong to me . If I have to speak for myself , I shall say , ' Good people , find a school for your daughters by Michaelmas , for after that time I must go and make the happiness of others . ' I ca n't bear to think of your long rides in November coming home wet at night with no one to take care of you . Oh ! if you leave it to me , I shall advise the parents to take their daughters away from the care of one whose heart will be absent . Though I could n't consent to any time before Michaelmas that would n't be fair or right , and I 'm sure you would n't urge me you are too good . "
61049	61081	61223	61223	she	2155	" Well , if you think that they will consider we have acted uprightly by them , let it be Michaelmas with all my heart . What does Lady Cumnor say ? "
61082	61127	60852	60852	she	2152	" Oh ! I told her I was afraid you would n't like waiting , because of your difficulties with your servants , and because of Molly it would be so desirable to enter on the new relationship with her as soon as possible . "
61128	61153	61223	61223	she	2155	" To be sure ; so it would . Poor child ! I 'm afraid the intelligence of my engagement has rather startled her . "
61154	61163	61165	61166	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2153	" Cynthia will feel it deeply , too , "
61183	61200	61202	61203	Mr. Gibson	238	" We will have her over to the wedding ! She and Molly shall be bridesmaids , "
61389	61487	61511	61512	young ladies	2165	" and she had been absolutely petted in some ; but still she was constantly encountering naughty or stubborn , or over - conscientious , or severe - judging , or curious and observant girls . And again , before Cynthia was born , she had longed for a boy , thinking it possible that if some three or four intervening relations died , he might come to be a baronet ; and instead of a son , lo and behold it was a daughter ! Nevertheless , with all her dislike to girls in the abstract as "
61493	61510	61511	61512	young ladies	2165	" and her aversion was not diminished by the fact of her having kept a school for "
61513	61622	61623	61623	Molly	162	" at Ashcombe , she really meant to be as kind as she could be to her new step - daughter , whom she remembered principally as a black - haired , sleepy child , in whose eyes she had read admiration of herself . Mrs. Kirkpatrick accepted Mr. Gibson principally because she was tired of the struggle of earning her own livelihood ; but she liked him personally nay , she even loved him in her torpid way , and she intended to be good to his daughter , though she felt as if it would have been easier for her to have been good to his son .
61633	61653	61654	61654	she	162	" I will be like Harriet . I will think of others . I wo n't think of myself , "
61732	61751	61718	61718	she	205	" Do n't put on your silk gown your white muslin will look the nicest , my dear . "
61752	61769	61718	61718	she	205	" Not my silk ? it is quite new ! I had it to come here . "
61770	61783	61718	61718	she	205	" Still , I think your white muslin suits you the best . "
61784	61791	61718	61718	she	205	" Anything but that horrid plaid silk "
61951	61978	61948	61948	Click	216	" What eyes ! so like your dear father 's ! How we shall love each other sha n't we , darling ? For his sake ! "
61979	61984	61986	61986	Molly	162	" I 'll try , "
61999	62012	62014	62015	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2175	" And you 've just got the same beautiful black curling hair ! "
62030	62038	62040	62040	Molly	162	" Papa 's hair is growing grey , "
62042	62068	62014	62015	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2175	" Is it ? I never see it . I never shall see it . He will always be to me the handsomest of men . "
62093	62126	62087	62087	she	162	" Still he will grow old , and his hair will grow grey . I think he will be just as handsome , but it wo n't be as a young man . "
62127	62158	62159	62159	Molly	162	" Ah ! that 's just it , love . He 'll always be handsome ; some people always are . And he is so fond of you , dear . "
62200	62228	62192	62192	she	162	" You do n't know how he speaks of you ; ' his little treasure , ' as he calls you . I 'm almost jealous sometimes . "
62258	62264	62251	62251	she	162	" tried to be good . "
62265	62303	62251	62251	she	162	" We must make him so happy . I 'm afraid he has had a great deal to annoy him at home ; but we will do away with all that now . You must tell me , "
62312	62326	62251	62251	she	162	" what he likes and dislikes , for of course you will know . "
62394	62441	62443	62443	she	162	" All men have their fancies and antipathies , even the wisest . I have known some gentlemen annoyed beyond measure by the merest trifles ; leaving a door open , or spilling tea in their saucers , or a shawl crookedly put on . Why , "
62449	62558	62443	62443	she	162	" I know of a house to which Lord Hollingford will never be asked again because he did n't wipe his shoes on both the mats in the hall ! Now you must tell me what your dear father dislikes most in these fanciful ways , and I shall take care to avoid it . You must be my little friend and helper in pleasing him . It will be such a pleasure to me to attend to his slightest fancies . About my dress , too what colours does he like best ? I want to do everything in my power with a view to his approval . "
62629	62633	62635	62635	she	162	" I think , "
62637	62710	62635	62635	she	162	" papa is n't particular about many things ; but I think our not having the dinner quite punctual quite ready for him when he comes in , fidgets him more than anything . You see , he has often had a long ride , and there is another long ride to come , and he has only half - an - hour sometimes only a quarter to eat his dinner in . "
62711	62770	62596	62596	she	162	" Thank you , my own love . Punctuality ! Yes ; it 's a great thing in a household . It 's what I 've had to enforce with my young ladies at Ashcombe . No wonder poor dear Mr. Gibson has been displeased at his dinner not being ready , and he so hard - worked ! "
62771	62806	62635	62635	she	162	" Papa does n't care what he has , if it 's only ready . He would take bread - and - cheese , if cook would only send it in instead of dinner . "
62807	62820	62596	62596	she	162	" Bread - and - cheese ! Does Mr. Gibson eat cheese ? "
62821	62831	62833	62833	Molly	162	" Yes ; he 's very fond of it , "
62837	62856	62833	62833	Molly	162	" I 've known him eat toasted cheese when he has been too tired to fancy anything else . "
62857	62922	62596	62596	she	162	" Oh ! but , my dear , we must change all that . I should n't like to think of your father eating cheese ; it 's such a strong - smelling , coarse kind of thing . We must get him a cook who can toss him up an omelette , or something elegant . Cheese is only fit for the kitchen . "
62923	62931	62933	62933	Molly	162	" Papa is very fond of it , "
62935	62967	62596	62596	she	162	" Oh ! but we will cure him of that . I could n't bear the smell of cheese ; and I 'm sure he would be sorry to annoy me . "
63029	63044	63024	63024	Molly	162	" Please ! I should so like to know something about Cynthia your daughter . "
63045	63126	63014	63014	each	1156	" Yes , call her Cynthia . It 's a pretty name , is n't it ? Cynthia Kirkpatrick . Not so pretty , though , as my old name , Hyacinth Clare . People used to say it suited me so well . I must show you an acrostic that a gentleman he was a lieutenant in the 53rd made upon it . Oh ! we shall have a great deal to say to each other , I foresee ! "
63127	63132	63024	63024	Molly	162	" But about Cynthia ? "
63133	63152	63014	63014	each	1156	" Oh , yes ! about dear Cynthia . What do you want to know , my dear ? "
63153	63168	63024	63024	Molly	162	" Papa said she was to live with us ! When will she come ? "
63169	63242	63014	63014	each	1156	" Oh , was it not sweet of your kind father ? I thought of nothing else but Cynthia 's going out as a governess when she had completed her education ; she has been brought up for it , and has had great advantages . But good dear Mr. Gibson would n't hear of it . He said yesterday that she must come and live with us when she left school . "
63243	63250	63024	63024	Molly	162	" When will she leave school ? "
63251	63298	63014	63014	each	1156	" She went for two years . I do n't think I must let her leave before next summer . She teaches English as well as learning French . Next summer she shall come home , and then sha n't we be a happy little quartette ? "
63299	63304	63306	63306	Molly	162	" I hope so , "
63308	63322	63323	63323	she	162	" But she is to come to the wedding , is n't she ? "
63342	63373	63014	63014	each	1156	" Your father has begged for her to come ; but we must think about it a little more before quite fixing it . The journey is a great expense ! "
63374	63388	63323	63323	she	162	" Is she like you ? I do so want to see her . "
63389	63427	63014	63014	each	1156	" She is very handsome , people say . In the bright - coloured style , perhaps something like what I was . But I like the dark - haired foreign kind of beauty best just now , "
63444	63454	63456	63456	Molly	162	" Does Cynthia is she very clever and accomplished ? "
63476	63558	63559	63559	Molly	162	" She ought to be ; I 've paid ever so much money to have her taught by the best masters . But you will see her before long , and I 'm afraid we must go now to Lady Cumnor . It has been very charming having you all to myself , but I know Lady Cumnor will be expecting us now , and she was very curious to see you , my future daughter , as she calls you . "
63683	63686	63662	63662	she	147	" the countess "
63710	63719	63690	63691	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2195	" My dear little daughter , Lady Cumnor ! "
63720	63796	63690	63691	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	2195	" Now , Clare , do n't let me have nonsense . She is not your daughter yet , and may never be , I believe that one - third of the engagements I have heard of , have never come to marriages . Miss Gibson , I am very glad to see you , for your father 's sake ; when I know you better , I hope it will be for your own . "
63864	63929	63841	63842	Lady Cumnor	150	" Yes , yes , I like her looks , Clare . You may make something of her . It will be a great advantage to you , my dear , to have a lady who has trained up several young people of quality always about you just at the time when you are growing up . I 'll tell you what , Clare ! "
63936	64023	63841	63842	Lady Cumnor	150	" you and she must become better acquainted you know nothing of each other at present ; you are not to be married till Christmas , and what could be better than that she should go back with you to Ashcombe ! She would be with you constantly , and have the advantage of the companionship of your young people , which would be a good thing for an only child ! It 's a capital plan ; I 'm very glad I thought of it ! "
64361	64407	64408	64408	she	150	" I do n't think it would be nice at all . I mean , my lady , that I should dislike it very much ; it would be taking me away from papa just these very few last months . I will like you , "
64442	64484	64425	64425	she	150	" I will try hard to love you , and to do all I can to make you happy ; but you must not take me away from papa just this very last bit of time that I shall have him . "
64602	64672	64600	64600	she	147	" Upon my word , young lady ! Why , Clare , you 've got your work before you ! Not but what there is a good deal of truth in what she says . It must be very disagreeable to a girl of her age to have a stepmother coming in between her father and herself , whatever may be the advantages to her in the long run . "
64825	64834	64789	64789	She	150	" You are sixteen , are you not ? "
64835	64849	64789	64789	She	150	" No ; I am seventeen . My birthday was three weeks ago . "
64850	64868	64789	64789	She	150	" Very much the same thing , I should think . Have you ever been to school ? "
64869	64883	64789	64789	She	150	" No , never ! Miss Eyre has taught me everything I know . "
64884	64922	64789	64789	She	150	" Umph ! Miss Eyre was your governess , I suppose ? I should not have thought your father could have afforded to keep a governess . But of course he must know his own affairs best . "
64923	64929	64931	64931	Molly	147	" Certainly , my lady , "
64946	65029	65030	65030	she	147	" You say ' certainly ! ' as if it was a matter of course that every one should know their own affairs best . You are very young , Miss Gibson very . You 'll know better before you come to my age . And I suppose you 've been taught music , and the use of globes , and French , and all the usual accomplishments , since you have had a governess ? I never heard of such nonsense ! "
65038	65062	65030	65030	she	147	" An only daughter ! If there had been half - a - dozen , there might have been some sense in it . "
65562	65594	65558	65559	her father	675	" What do you think of this plan of Lady Cumnor 's ? She says she was advising you to have Molly as a visitor at Ashcombe until we are married . "
65681	65758	65679	65679	herself	2258	" It would be a charming plan , only Well ! we know why we would rather not have it , do n't we , love ? And we wo n't tell papa , for fear of making him vain . No ! I think I must leave her with you , dear Mr. Gibson , to have you all to herself for these last few weeks . It would be cruel to take her away . "
65759	65787	65789	65790	Mr. Gibson	238	" But you know , my dear , I told you of the reason why it does not do to have Molly at home just at present , "
66079	66082	66109	66109	her	147	" trumpery , "
66258	66265	66242	66242	he	675	" God bless you , child ! "
66418	66434	66435	66435	he	203	" My mother has been looking for you to come back for this last hour , "
66475	66505	66472	66472	Roger	203	" I 'm afraid you 've had a very trying day . I have thought of you several times , for I know how awkward these new relations are . "
66506	66510	66512	66512	she	147	" Thank you , "
66526	66559	66512	66512	she	147	" I did try to remember what you said , and to think more of others , but it is so difficult sometimes ; you know it is , do n't you ? "
66560	66563	66565	66565	he	203	" Yes , "
66674	66679	66680	66680	he	203	" It is difficult , "
66684	66700	66680	66680	he	203	" but by - and - by you will be so much happier for it . "
66701	66708	66710	66710	Molly	147	" No , I sha n't ! "
66716	66783	66713	66713	her	147	" It will be very dull when I shall have killed myself , as it were , and live only in trying to do , and to be , as other people like . I do n't see any end to it . I might as well never have lived . And as for the happiness you speak of , I shall never be happy again . "
66829	66854	66791	66791	she	147	" Nonsense : perhaps in ten years ' time you will be looking back on this trial as a very light one who knows ? "
66855	66929	66930	66930	She	147	" I daresay it seems foolish ; perhaps all our earthly trials will appear foolish to us after a while ; perhaps they seem so now to angels . But we are ourselves , you know , and this is now , not some time to come , a long , long way off . And we are not angels , to be comforted by seeing the ends for which everything is sent . "
67065	67091	67092	67092	Molly	147	" I know , I understand . Yes : it is now we have to do with . Do n't let us go into metaphysics . "
67109	67150	67101	67101	she	147	" One looks forward to a mass of trials , which will only have to be encountered one by one , little by little . Oh , here is my mother ! she will tell you better than I can . "
67399	67547	67390	67390	He	203	" ' Pon my word , now , I wish I 'd never spoken those unlucky words that first day at dinner . Do you remember how she took them up ? It was like a prophecy of what was to come , now , was n't it ? And she looked pale from that day , and I do n't think she has ever fairly enjoyed her food since . I must take more care what I say for the future . Not but what Gibson is doing the very best thing , both for himself and her , that he can do . I told him so only yesterday . But I 'm very sorry for the little girl , though . I wish I 'd never spoken about it , that I do ! but it was like a prophecy , was n't it ? "
67841	67959	67830	67830	His	153	" I told you so . Now did n't I say what a good , suitable thing this affair between Gibson and Clare would be ! I do n't know when I 've been so much pleased . You may despise the trade of match - maker , my lady , but I am very proud of it . After this , I shall go on looking out for suitable cases among the middle - aged people of my acquaintance . I sha n't meddle with young folks , they are so apt to be fanciful ; but I 've been so successful in this , that I do think it 's good encouragement to go on . "
67960	67966	67968	67969	Lady Cumnor	150	" Go on with what ? "
67973	67988	67830	67830	His	153	" Oh , planning , you ca n't deny that I planned this match . "
67989	68007	68008	68008	she	150	" I do n't think you are likely to do either much good or harm by planning , "
68017	68029	67830	67830	His	153	" It puts it into people 's heads , my dear . "
68030	68064	68079	68080	Lord Cumnor	153	" Yes , if you speak about your plans to them , of course it does . But in this case you never spoke to either Mr. Gibson or Clare , did you ? "
68109	68122	68089	68089	she	150	" No ! I never spoke to them ; of course not . "
68123	68151	68153	68155	his pitiless wife	2309	" Then you must be strongly mesmeric , and your will acted upon theirs , if you are to take credit for any part in the affair , "
68157	68242	68089	68089	she	150	" I really ca n't say . It 's no use looking back to what I said or did . I 'm very well satisfied with it , and that 's enough , and I mean to show them how much I 'm pleased . I shall give Clare something towards her rigging out , and they shall have a breakfast at Ashcombe Manor - house . I 'll write to Preston about it . When did you say they were to be married ? "
68243	68335	68089	68089	she	150	" I think they 'd better wait till Christmas , and I have told them so . It would amuse the children , going over to Ashcombe for the wedding ; and if it 's bad weather during the holidays I 'm always afraid of their finding it dull at the Towers . It 's very different if it 's a good frost , and they can go out skating and sledging in the park . But these last two years it has been so wet for them , poor dears ! "
68336	68385	68386	68386	he	2310	" And will the other poor dears be content to wait to make a holiday for your grandchildren ? ' To make a Roman holiday . ' Pope , or somebody else , has a line of poetry like that . ' To make a Roman holiday , ' "
68397	68431	68089	68089	she	150	" It 's Byron , and it 's nothing to do with the subject in hand . I 'm surprised at your lordship 's quoting Byron , he was a very immoral poet . "
68432	68445	68447	68448	Lord Cumnor	153	" I saw him take his oaths in the House of Lords , "
68452	68463	68465	68466	Lady Cumnor	150	" Well ! the less said about him the better , "
68468	68502	68465	68466	Lady Cumnor	150	" I have told Clare that she had better not think of being married before Christmas : and it wo n't do for her to give up her school in a hurry either . "
69902	69905	69899	69899	he	238	" promiscuous , "
69952	69981	69982	69982	she	2357	" To think of Molly , as I have held in long - clothes , coming to have a lover ! Well , to be sure ! Sister Phobe "
69990	70028	69982	69982	she	2357	" here 's a piece of news ! Molly Gibson has got a lover ! One may almost say she 's had an offer ! Mr. Gibson , may not one ? and she 's but sixteen ! "
70029	70034	70036	70037	Miss Phobe	159	" Seventeen , sister , "
70053	70062	70041	70041	herself	2357	" Seventeen , the 22nd of last June . "
70063	70082	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Well , have it your own way . Seventeen , if you like to call her so ! "
70089	70116	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" The fact is still the same she 's got a lover ; and it seems to me she was in long - clothes only yesterday . "
70117	70132	70134	70135	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm sure I hope her course of true love will run smooth , "
70172	70249	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Molly knows nothing about it . I have n't even named it to any one but you two , and to one other friend . I trounced Coxe well , and did my best to keep his attachment as he calls it in bounds . But I was sadly puzzled what to do about Molly . Miss Eyre was away , and I could n't leave them in the house together without any older woman . "
70250	70265	70268	70269	Miss Browning	159	" Oh , Mr. Gibson ! why did you not send her to us ? "
70271	70296	70268	70269	Miss Browning	159	" We would have done anything in our power for you ; for your sake , as well as her poor dear mother 's . "
70297	70363	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Thank you . I know you would , but it would n't have done to have had her in Hollingford , just at the time of Coxe 's effervescence . He 's better now . His appetite has come back with double force , after the fasting he thought it right to exhibit . He had three helpings of black - currant dumpling yesterday . "
70364	70390	70268	70269	Miss Browning	159	" I am sure you are most liberal , Mr. Gibson . Three helpings ! And , I daresay , butcher 's meat in proportion ? "
70391	70443	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Oh ! I only named it because , with such very young men , it 's generally see - saw between appetite and love , and I thought the third helping a very good sign . But still , you know , what has happened once , may happen again . "
70444	70457	70459	70460	Miss Browning	159	" I do n't know . Phobe had an offer of marriage once "
70462	70478	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Hush ! sister . It might hurt his feelings to have it spoken about . "
70479	70502	70084	70085	Miss Browning	159	" Nonsense , child ! It 's five - and - twenty years ago ; and his eldest daughter is married herself . "
70503	70512	70518	70518	her	159	" I own he has not been constant , "
70524	70544	70514	70515	Miss Phobe	159	" All men are not like you , Mr. Gibson faithful to the memory of their first - love . "
70605	70610	70612	70612	he	238	" Well , well , "
70614	70655	70612	70612	he	238	" at any rate , I thought I must do something to protect Molly from such affairs while she was so young , and before I had given my sanction . Miss Eyre 's little nephew fell ill of scarlet fever "
70656	70680	70766	70767	Miss Phobe	159	" Ah ! by - the - by , how careless of me not to inquire . How is the poor little fellow ? "
70681	70725	70612	70612	he	238	" Worse better . It does n't signify to what I 've got to say now ; the fact was , Miss Eyre could n't come back to my house for some time , and I can not leave Molly altogether at Hamley . "
70726	70752	70766	70767	Miss Phobe	159	" Ah ! I see now , why there was that sudden visit to Hamley . Upon my word , it 's quite a romance . "
70753	70764	70766	70767	Miss Phobe	159	" I do like hearing of a love - affair , "
70769	70788	70790	70791	Mr. Gibson	238	" Then if you 'll let me get on with my story , you shall hear of mine , "
70802	70805	70807	70808	Miss Phobe	159	" Yours ! "
70812	70819	70821	70822	Miss Browning	159	" Bless us and save us ! "
70831	70835	70821	70822	Miss Browning	159	" what next ? "
70836	70843	70845	70846	Mr. Gibson	238	" My marriage , I hope , "
70858	70871	70845	70846	Mr. Gibson	238	" And that 's what I came to speak to you about . "
70905	70945	70883	70883	She	159	" that the only man who could ever bring her to think of matrimony was Mr. Gibson ; but that if he ever proposed , she should feel bound to accept him , for poor dear Mary 's sake ; "
71044	71090	71216	71217	Miss Phobe	159	" Of course it has been an anxious thing for me to decide who I should ask to be the mistress of my family , the mother of my girl ; but I think I 've decided rightly at last . The lady I have chosen "
71091	71106	71111	71112	Miss Browning	159	" Tell us at once who she is , there 's a good man , "
71114	71118	71120	71122	the bridegroom elect	2368	" Mrs. Kirkpatrick , "
71124	71141	71216	71217	Miss Phobe	159	" What ! the governess at the Towers , that the countess makes so much of ? "
71142	71203	71216	71217	Miss Phobe	159	" Yes ; she is much valued by them and deservedly so . She keeps a school now at Ashcombe , and is accustomed to housekeeping . She has brought up the young ladies at the Towers , and has a daughter of her own , therefore it is probable she will have a kind , motherly feeling towards Molly . "
71204	71214	71216	71217	Miss Phobe	159	" She 's a very elegant - looking woman , "
71244	71268	71216	71217	Miss Phobe	159	" I 've seen her in the carriage , riding backwards with the countess : a very pretty woman , I should say . "
71269	71274	71276	71277	Miss Browning	159	" Nonsense , sister , "
71279	71351	71276	71277	Miss Browning	159	" What has her elegance or prettiness to do with the affair ? Did you ever know a widower marry again for such trifles as those ? It 's always from a sense of duty of one kind or another is n't it , Mr. Gibson ? They want a housekeeper ; or they want a mother for their children ; or they think their last wife would have liked it . "
71400	71503	71612	71613	Miss Browning	159	" You must have it your own way , Miss Browning . Settle my motives for me . I do n't pretend to be quite clear about them myself . But I am clear in wishing heartily to keep my old friends , and for them to love my future wife for my sake . I do n't know any two women in the world , except Molly and Mrs. Kirkpatrick , I regard as much as I do you . Besides , I want to ask you if you will let Molly come and stay with you till after my marriage ? "
71504	71516	71518	71519	Miss Browning	159	" You might have asked us before you asked Madam Hamley , "
71525	71549	71518	71519	Miss Browning	159	" We are your old friends ; and we were her mother 's friends , too ; though we are not county folk . "
71550	71555	71557	71558	Mr. Gibson	238	" That 's unjust , "
71560	71567	71557	71558	Mr. Gibson	238	" And you know it is . "
71568	71611	71612	71613	Miss Browning	159	" I do n't know . You are always with Lord Hollingford , when you can get at him , much more than you ever are with Mr. Goodenough , or Mr. Smith . And you are always going over to Hamley . "
71624	71691	71612	71613	Miss Browning	159	" I seek Lord Hollingford as I should seek such a man , whatever his rank or position might be : usher to a school , carpenter , shoemaker , if it were possible for them to have had a similar character of mind developed by similar advantages . Mr. Goodenough is a very clever attorney , with strong local interests and not a thought beyond . "
71692	71749	71612	71613	Miss Browning	159	" Well , well , do n't go on arguing , it always gives me a headache , as Phobe knows . I did n't mean what I said , that 's enough , is n't it ? I 'll retract anything sooner than be reasoned with . Where were we before you began your arguments ? "
71750	71762	71764	71765	Miss Phobe	159	" About dear little Molly coming to pay us a visit , "
71767	72019	71612	71613	Miss Browning	159	" I should have asked you at first , only Coxe was so rampant with his love . I did n't know what he might do , or how troublesome he might be both to Molly and you . But he has cooled down now . Absence has had a very tranquillizing effect , and I think Molly may be in the same town with him , without any consequences beyond a few sighs every time she 's brought to his mind by meeting her . And I 've got another favour to ask of you , so you see it would never do for me to argue with you , Miss Browning , when I ought to be a humble suppliant . Something must be done to the house to make it all ready for the future Mrs. Gibson . It wants painting and papering shamefully , and I should think some new furniture , but I 'm sure I do n't know what . Would you be so very kind as to look over the place , and see how far a hundred pounds will go ? The dining - room walls must be painted ; we 'll keep the drawing - room paper for her choice , and I 've a little spare money for that room for her to lay out ; but all the rest of the house I 'll leave to you , if you 'll only be kind enough to help an old friend . "
73128	73143	73145	73146	Miss Browning	159	" You seem to have seen a great deal of Mr. Roger , Molly ! "
73234	73244	73246	73246	Molly	147	" Yes ; he was very kind to me , "
73273	73376	73263	73263	she	147	" I daresay you will soon be going to Hamley Hall again ? He 's not the eldest son , you know , Phobe ! Do n't make my head ache with your eternal ' eighteen , nineteen , ' but attend to the conversation . Molly is telling us how much she saw of Mr. Roger , and how kind he was to her . I 've always heard he was a very nice young man , my dear . Tell us some more about him ! Now , Phobe , attend ! How was he kind to you , Molly ? "
73377	73400	73263	73263	she	147	" Oh , he told me what books to read ; and one day he made me notice how many bees I saw "
73401	73420	73263	73263	she	147	" Bees , child ! What do you mean ? Either you or he must have been crazy ! "
73421	73465	73467	73467	Molly	147	" No , not at all . There are more than two hundred kinds of bees in England , and he wanted me to notice the difference between them and flies . Miss Browning , I ca n't help seeing what you fancy , "
73474	73511	73467	73467	Molly	147	" but it is very wrong ; it is all a mistake . I wo n't speak another word about Mr. Roger or Hamley at all , if it puts such silly notions into your head . "
73512	73562	73263	73263	she	147	" Highty - tighty ! Here 's a young lady to be lecturing her elders ! Silly notions indeed ! They are in your head , it seems . And let me tell you , Molly , you are too young to let your mind be running on lovers . "
73583	73634	73635	73635	Molly	147	" I never said what the ' silly notion ' was , Miss Browning ; did I now , Miss Phobe ? Do n't you see , dear Miss Phobe , it is all her own interpretation , and according to her own fancy , this foolish talk about lovers ? "
73685	73776	73652	73653	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm sure I do n't know anything about it , my dear . It seems to me that what Dorothy was saying was very true very true indeed ; and I think , love , you misunderstood her ; or , perhaps , she misunderstood you ; or I may be misunderstanding it altogether ; so we 'd better not talk any more about it . What price did you say you were going to give for the drugget in Mr. Gibson 's dining - room , sister ? "
74036	74046	74048	74048	she	714	" I was afraid you were asleep , child , "
74057	74189	74048	74048	she	714	" But I wanted to say to you we 've got wrong to - day , somehow ; and I think it was perhaps my doing . It 's as well Phobe should n't know , for she thinks me perfect ; and when there 's only two of us , we get along better if one of us thinks the other can do no wrong . But I rather think I was a little cross . We 'll not say any more about it , Molly ; only we 'll go to sleep friends , and friends we 'll always be , child , wo n't we ? Now give me a kiss , and do n't cry and swell your eyes up ; and put out your candle carefully . "
74190	74199	74201	74201	Molly	147	" I was wrong it was my fault , "
74206	74233	74048	74048	she	714	" Fiddlestick - ends ! Do n't contradict me ! I say it was my fault , and I wo n't hear another word about it . "
74329	74335	74336	74337	Miss Browning	159	" Very bright and pretty , "
74388	74417	74384	74384	Betty	147	" Come up now , and see your papa 's bedroom . He 's sleeping upstairs in yours , that everything may be done up afresh in his . "
74660	74687	74689	74690	Miss Browning	159	" You see , we must have all in order for a lady who has passed so much of her time in the countess 's mansion , "
74716	74896	74689	74690	Miss Browning	159	" Cromer , the upholsterer , wanted to persuade me to have a sofa and a writing - table . These men will say anything is the fashion , if they want to sell an article . I said , ' No , no , Cromer : bedrooms are for sleeping in , and sitting - rooms are for sitting in . Keep everything to its right purpose , and do n't try and delude me into nonsense . ' Why , my mother would have given us a fine scolding if she had ever caught us in our bedrooms in the daytime . We kept our out - door things in a closet downstairs ; and there was a very tidy place for washing our hands , which is as much as one wants in the daytime . Stuffing up a bedroom with sofas and tables ! I never heard of such a thing . Besides , a hundred pounds wo n't last for ever . I sha'n't be able to do anything for your room , Molly ! "
74897	74906	74908	74908	Molly	147	" I 'm right down glad of it , "
74910	74946	74908	74908	Molly	147	" Nearly everything in it was what mamma had when she lived with my great - uncle . I would n't have had it changed for the world ; I am so fond of it . "
74947	74980	74689	74690	Miss Browning	159	" Well , there 's no danger of it , now the money is run out . By the way , Molly , who 's to buy you a bridesmaid 's dress ? "
74981	74987	74989	74989	Molly	147	" I do n't know , "
74991	75012	74989	74989	Molly	147	" I suppose I am to be a bridesmaid ; but no one has spoken to me about my dress . "
75013	75021	74689	74690	Miss Browning	159	" Then I shall ask your papa . "
75022	75060	74989	74989	Molly	147	" Please , do n't . He must have to spend a great deal of money just now . Besides , I would rather not be at the wedding , if they 'll let me stay away . "
75061	75094	75096	75097	Mr. Gibson	238	" Nonsense , child . Why , all the town would be talking of it . You must go , and you must be well dressed , for your father 's sake . "
75206	75214	75216	75216	she	147	" I wonder if I 'm pretty , "
75218	75247	75216	75216	she	147	" I almost think I am in this kind of dress I mean , of course . Betty would say , ' Fine feathers make fine birds . ' "
75275	75289	75266	75266	she	147	" Well , upon my word ! I should n't have known you . "
75290	75294	75296	75296	Molly	147	" Fine feathers , "
75304	75315	75317	75318	Miss Phobe	159	" You are really beautiful is n't she , sister ? "
75320	75349	75317	75318	Miss Phobe	159	" Why , my dear , if you were always dressed , you would be prettier than your dear mamma , whom we always reckoned so very personable . "
75350	75373	75266	75266	she	147	" You 're not a bit like her . You favour your father , and white always sets off a brown complexion . "
75374	75381	75383	75384	Miss Phobe	159	" But is n't she beautiful ? "
75386	75427	75266	75266	she	147	" Well ! and if she is , Providence made her , and not she herself . Besides , the dressmaker must go shares . What a fine India muslin it is ! it 'll have cost a pretty penny ! "
75855	75861	75863	75863	he	247	" the little Gibson - girl "
76045	76068	76070	76071	the housemaid	6795	" This is my Lady Harriet 's room when her ladyship comes to the Manor - house with my lord the earl , "
76090	76106	76070	76071	the housemaid	6795	" Shall I help you to dress , miss ? I always helps her ladyship . "

76411	76433	76435	76436	Mr. Preston	247	" This room is that which Lady Harriet uses when she comes here with her father for a day or two , "
76452	76459	76435	76436	Mr. Preston	247	" Does she often come here ? "
76460	76493	76528	76529	Mr. Preston	247	" Not often . But I fancy she likes being here when she does . Perhaps she finds it an agreeable change after the more formal life she leads at the Towers . "
76494	76508	76510	76510	Molly	147	" I should think it was a very pleasant house to stay at , "
76540	76609	76528	76529	Mr. Preston	247	" I was afraid a young lady like you might perceive all the incongruities of a bachelor 's home . I 'm very much obliged to you , Miss Gibson . In general I live pretty much in the room in which we shall dine ; and I 've a sort of agent 's office in which I keep books and papers , and receive callers on business . "
76914	76955	76956	76956	He	247	" That is said to be Mademoiselle de St. Quentin , a great beauty at the French Court . This is Madame du Barri . Do you see any likeness in Mademoiselle de St. Quentin to any one you know ? "
76969	76972	76974	76974	Molly	147	" No ! "
76981	76991	76974	76974	Molly	147	" I never saw any one half so beautiful . "
76992	77005	77006	77006	he	247	" But do n't you see a likeness in the eyes particularly ? "
77028	77038	77014	77014	Molly	147	" It constantly reminds me of of Miss Kirkpatrick . "
77039	77043	77045	77045	Molly	147	" Does it ? "
77049	77089	77045	77045	Molly	147	" Oh ! I am so glad I 've never seen her , so of course I could n't find out the likeness . You know her , then , do you ? Please tell me all about her . "
77104	77130	77014	77014	Molly	147	" She 's very beautiful ; that of course is understood when I say that this miniature does not come up to her for beauty . "
77131	77140	77014	77014	Molly	147	" And besides ? Go on , please . "
77141	77151	77014	77014	Molly	147	" What do you mean by ' besides ' ? "
77152	77164	77014	77014	Molly	147	" Oh ! I suppose she 's very clever and accomplished ? "
77191	77255	77014	77014	Molly	147	" She is clever naturally ; she has picked up accomplishments . But she has such a charm about her , one forgets what she herself is in the halo that surrounds her . You ask me all this , Miss Gibson , and I answer truthfully ; or else I should not entertain one young lady with my enthusiastic praises of another . "
77256	77264	77266	77266	Molly	147	" I do n't see why not , "
77268	77332	77266	77266	Molly	147	" Besides , if you would n't do it in general , I think you ought to do it in my case ; for you , perhaps , do n't know , but she is coming to live with us when she leaves school , and we are very nearly the same age ; so it will be almost like having a sister . "
77333	77344	77346	77347	Mr. Preston	247	" She is to live with you , is she ? "
77356	77393	77346	77347	Mr. Preston	247	" And when is she to leave school ? I thought she would surely have been at this wedding ; but I was told she was not to come . When is she to leave school ? "
77394	77438	77014	77014	Molly	147	" I think it is to be at Easter . You know she 's at Boulogne , and it 's a long journey for her to come alone ; or else papa wished for her to be at the marriage very much indeed . "
77439	77449	77346	77347	Mr. Preston	247	" And her mother prevented it ? I understand . "
77450	77472	77014	77014	Molly	147	" No , it was n't her mother ; it was the French schoolmistress , who did n't think it desirable . "
77473	77495	77346	77347	Mr. Preston	247	" It comes to pretty much the same thing . And she 's to return and live with you after Easter ? "
77496	77510	77014	77014	Molly	147	" I believe so . Is she a grave or a merry person ? "
77511	77566	77346	77347	Mr. Preston	247	" Never very grave , as far as I have seen of her . Sparkling would be the word for her , I think . Do you ever write to her ? If you do , pray remember me to her , and tell her how we have been talking about her you and I. "
77567	77574	77576	77576	Molly	147	" I never write to her , "
77611	77674	77607	77608	Mr. Preston	247	" I pique myself on my keen relish for all creature comforts , and also on my power of doing without them , if need be . My lord 's woods are ample , and I indulge myself with a fire in my bedroom for nine months in the year ; yet I could travel in Iceland without wincing from the cold . "
77763	77889	77750	77754	a sort of amateur bridesmaid	2515	" as she called it . They went from the Manor - house in two carriages to the church in the park , Mr. Preston and Mr. Gibson in one , and Molly , to her dismay , shut up with Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet in the other . Lady Harriet 's gown of white muslin had seen one or two garden - parties , and was not in the freshest order ; it had been rather a freak of the young lady 's at the last moment . She was very merry , and very much inclined to talk to Molly , by way of finding out what sort of a little personage Clare was to have for her future daughter . She began :
77890	77918	77984	77985	Lady Harriet	168	" We must n't crush this pretty muslin dress of yours . Put it over papa 's knee ; he does n't mind it in the least . "
77919	77964	77750	77754	a sort of amateur bridesmaid	2515	" What , my dear , a white dress ! no , to be sure not . I rather like it . Besides , going to a wedding , who minds anything ? It would be different if we were going to a funeral . "
78002	78054	77995	77995	she	168	" I daresay it 's something of a trial to you , this second marriage of your father 's ; but you 'll find Clare the most amiable of women . She always let me have my own way , and I 've no doubt she 'll let you have yours . "
78055	78064	78066	78066	Molly	147	" I mean to try and like her , "
78090	78100	78066	78066	Molly	147	" I 've seen very little of her yet . "
78101	78120	78122	78123	Lord Cumnor	153	" Why , it 's the very best thing for you that could have happened , my dear , "
78125	78222	78122	78123	Lord Cumnor	153	" You 're growing up into a young lady and a very pretty young lady , too , if you 'll allow an old man to say so and who so proper as your father 's wife to bring you out , and show you off , and take you to balls , and that kind of thing ? I always said this match that is going to come off to - day was the most suitable thing I ever knew ; and it 's even a better thing for you than for the people themselves . "
78223	78227	78229	78230	Lady Harriet	168	" Poor child ! "
78243	78273	78229	78230	Lady Harriet	168	" the thought of balls is too much for her just now ; but you 'll like having Cynthia Kirkpatrick for a companion , sha n't you , dear ? "
78274	78278	78280	78280	Molly	147	" Very much , "
78287	78293	78280	78280	Molly	147	" Do you know her ? "
78294	78365	78229	78230	Lady Harriet	168	" Oh , I 've seen her over and over again when she was a little girl , and once or twice since . She 's the prettiest creature that you ever saw ; and with eyes that mean mischief , if I 'm not mistaken . But Clare kept her spirit under pretty well when she was staying with us , afraid of her being troublesome , I fancy . "
78769	78820	78764	78765	Lady Harriet	168	" I like you ; you are a little wild creature , and I want to tame you . Come here , and sit on this stool by me . What is your name ? or what do they call you ? as North - country people would express it . "
78821	78831	78764	78765	Lady Harriet	168	" Molly Gibson . My real name is Mary . "
78832	78907	78764	78765	Lady Harriet	168	" Molly is a nice , soft - sounding name . People in the last century were n't afraid of homely names ; now we are all so smart and fine : no more ' Lady Bettys ' now . I almost wonder they have n't re - christened all the worsted and knitting - cotton that bears her name . Fancy Lady Constantia 's cotton , or Lady Anna - Maria 's worsted . "
78908	78921	78923	78923	Molly	147	" I did n't know there was a Lady Betty 's cotton , "
78925	78996	78764	78765	Lady Harriet	168	" That proves you do n't do fancy - work ! You 'll find Clare will set you to it , though . She used to set me at piece after piece : knights kneeling to ladies ; impossible flowers . But I must do her the justice to add that when I got tired of them she finished them herself . I wonder how you 'll get on together ? "
78997	79002	79008	79008	her	147	" So do I ! "
79011	79077	78764	78765	Lady Harriet	168	" I used to think I managed her , till one day an uncomfortable suspicion arose that all the time she had been managing me . Still it 's easy work to let oneself be managed ; at any rate till one wakens up to the consciousness of the process , and then it may become amusing , if one takes it in that light . "
79078	79086	79088	79088	Molly	147	" I should hate to be managed , "
79092	79124	79088	79088	Molly	147	" I 'll try and do what she wishes for papa 's sake , if she 'll only tell me outright ; but I should dislike to be trapped into anything . "
79125	79129	79131	79132	Lady Harriet	168	" Now I , "
79134	79199	79131	79132	Lady Harriet	168	" am too lazy to avoid traps ; and I rather like to remark the cleverness with which they 're set . But then , of course , I know that if I choose to exert myself , I can break through the withes of green flax with which they try to bind me . Now , perhaps , you wo n't be able . "
79200	79210	79212	79212	Molly	147	" I do n't quite understand what you mean , "
79214	79321	79131	79132	Lady Harriet	168	" Oh , well never mind ; I daresay it 's as well for you that you should n't . The moral of all I have been saying is , ' Be a good girl , and suffer yourself to be led , and you 'll find your new stepmother the sweetest creature imaginable . ' You 'll get on capitally with her , I make no doubt . How you 'll get on with her daughter is another affair ; but I daresay very well . Now we 'll ring for tea ; for I suppose that heavy breakfast is to stand for our lunch . "
79371	79381	79383	79384	Lady Harriet	168	" I can not bear that sort of person , "
79394	79467	79383	79384	Lady Harriet	168	" giving himself airs of gallantry towards one to whom his simple respect is all his duty . I can talk to one of my father 's labourers with pleasure , while with a man like that underbred fop I am all over thorns and nettles . What is it the Irish call that style of creature ? They 've some capital word for it , I know . What is it ? "
79468	79478	79480	79480	Molly	147	" I do n't know I never heard it , "
79489	79574	79383	79384	Lady Harriet	168	" Oh ! that shows you 've never read Miss Edgeworth 's tales ; now , have you ? If you had , you 'd have recollected that there was such a word , even if you did n't remember what it was . If you 've never read those stories , they would be just the thing to beguile your solitude vastly improving and moral , and yet quite sufficiently interesting . I 'll lend them to you while you 're all alone . "
79575	79595	79383	79384	Lady Harriet	168	" I 'm not alone . I 'm not at home , but on a visit to Miss Brownings . "
79596	79682	79383	79384	Lady Harriet	168	" Then I 'll bring them to you . I know the Miss Brownings ; they used to come regularly on the school - day to the Towers . Pecksy and Flapsy I used to call them . I like the Miss Brownings ; one gets enough of respect from them at any rate ; and I 've always wanted to see the kind of mťnage of such people . I 'll bring you a whole pile of Miss Edgeworth 's stories , my dear . "
79707	79710	79694	79694	she	147	" Your ladyship "
79729	79768	79694	79694	she	147	" your ladyship keeps speaking of the sort of the class of people to which I belong as if it was a kind of strange animal you were talking about ; yet you talk so openly to me that "
79769	79780	79694	79694	she	147	" Well , go on I like to hear you . "
79784	79800	79802	79803	Lady Harriet	168	" You think me in your heart a little impertinent now , do n't you ? "
79835	79851	79819	79819	she	147	" Yes ! a little . But I think you a great many other things . "
79852	80081	79819	79819	she	147	" We 'll leave the ' other things ' for the present . Do n't you see , little one , I talk after my kind , just as you talk after your kind . It 's only on the surface with both of us . Why , I daresay some of your good Hollingford ladies talk of the poor people in a manner which they would consider as impertinent in their turn , if they could hear it . But I ought to be more considerate when I remember how often my blood has boiled at the modes of speech and behaviour of one of my aunts , mamma 's sister , Lady No ! I wo n't name names . Any one who earns his livelihood by any exercise of head or hands , from professional people and rich merchants down to labourers , she calls ' persons . ' She would never in her most slip - slop talk accord them even the conventional title of ' gentlemen ; ' and the way in which she takes possession of human beings , ' my woman , ' ' my people , ' but , after all , it is only a way of speaking . I ought not to have used it to you ; but somehow I separate you from all these Hollingford people . "
80082	80086	80088	80088	Molly	147	" But why ? "
80090	80097	80088	80088	Molly	147	" I 'm one of them . "
80098	80240	79819	79819	she	147	" Yes , you are . But now do n't reprove me again for impertinence most of them are so unnatural in their exaggerated respect and admiration when they come up to the Towers , and put on so much pretence by way of fine manners , that they only make themselves objects of ridicule . You at least are simple and truthful , and that 's why I separate you in my own mind from them , and have talked unconsciously to you as I would well ! now here 's another piece of impertinence as I would to my equal in rank , I mean ; for I do n't set myself up in solid things as any better than my neighbours . Here 's tea , however , come in time to stop me from growing too humble . "
80266	80303	80262	80263	Mr. Preston	247	" Lady Harriet , will you allow me the pleasure of showing you some alterations I have made in the flower - garden in which I have tried to consult your taste before it grows dark ? "
80313	80339	80310	80310	Click	216	" Thank you , Mr. Preston . I will ride over with papa some day , and we will see if we approve of them . "
80366	80398	80363	80363	he	247	" Will not you come out , Miss Gibson , and see something of the gardens ? You have n't been out at all , I think , excepting to church . "
80486	80512	80482	80483	Lady Harriet	168	" I can not spare Miss Gibson . If she would like to see the place , I will bring her over some day myself . "
80524	80629	80520	80521	Lady Harriet	168	" I daresay it 's my own lazy selfishness has kept you indoors all day against your will . But , at any rate , you are not to go out walking with that man . I 've an instinctive aversion to him ; not entirely instinctive either ; it has some foundation in fact ; and I desire you do n't allow him ever to get intimate with you . He 's a very clever land - agent , and does his duty by papa , and I do n't choose to be taken up for libel ; but remember what I say ! "
80680	80703	80705	80708	Lady Harriet of Molly	2545	" Would you rather come in and dine with us we should send you home , of course or go home straight ? "
80731	80751	80705	80708	Lady Harriet of Molly	2545	" Tell the truth , now and evermore . Truth is generally amusing , if it 's nothing else ! "
80752	80767	80769	80769	Molly	147	" I would rather go back to Miss Brownings ' at once , please , "
80823	80851	80809	80810	Lady Harriet	168	" I shall come some day soon , and bring you a load of Miss Edgeworth 's tales , and make further acquaintance with Pecksy and Flapsy . "
80852	80860	80862	80862	Molly	147	" No , do n't , please , "
80873	80883	80862	80862	Molly	147	" You must not come indeed you must not . "
80884	80888	80809	80810	Lady Harriet	168	" Why not ? "
80889	80925	80862	80862	Molly	147	" Because I would rather not because I think that I ought not to have any one coming to see me who laughs at the friends I am staying with , and calls them names . "
80942	80948	80950	80951	Lady Harriet	168	" My dear little woman ! "
80961	81012	80950	80951	Lady Harriet	168	" I 'm very sorry to have called them names very , very sorry to have hurt you . If I promise you to be respectful to them in word and in deed and in very thought , if I can you 'll let me then , wo n't you ? "
81016	81041	81013	81013	Molly	147	" I 'd better go home at once ; I shall only say wrong things and there 's Lord Cumnor waiting all this time . "
81042	81069	81101	81101	They	2551	" Let him alone ; he 's very well amused hearing all the news of the day from Brown . Then I shall come under promise ? "
81424	81434	81436	81436	she	147	" I would rather never be married at all , "
81438	81465	81436	81436	she	147	" than marry an ugly man , and dear good Mr. Roger is really ugly ; I do n't think one could even call him plain . "
81599	81682	81562	81562	he	203	" I 've brought you the wasps'-nest I promised you , Miss Gibson . There has been no lack of such things this year ; we 've taken seventy - four on my father 's land alone ; and one of the labourers , a poor fellow who ekes out his wages by bee - keeping , has had a sad misfortune the wasps have turned the bees out of his seven hives , taken possession , and eaten up the honey . "
81683	81689	81691	81692	Miss Browning	159	" What greedy little vermin ! "
81731	81748	81750	81751	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm sure they deserve fire and brimstone more than the poor dear innocent bees , "
81753	81772	81773	81773	She	147	" And then it seems so ungrateful of mankind , who are going to feast on the honey ! "
81803	81909	81795	81795	he	203	" My brother and I are going with my father to an agricultural meeting at Canonbury on Thursday , and my mother desired me to say to you how very much obliged she should be if you would spare her Miss Gibson for the day . She was very anxious to ask for the pleasure of your company , too , but she really is so poorly that we persuaded her to be content with Miss Gibson , as she would n't scruple leaving a young lady to amuse herself , which she would be unwilling to do if you and your sister were there . "
81910	81929	81931	81932	Miss Browning	159	" I 'm sure she 's very kind ; very . Nothing would have given us more pleasure , "
81941	81999	81935	81935	herself	159	" Oh , yes , we quite understand , Mr. Roger ; and we fully recognize Mrs. Hamley 's kind intention . We will take the will for the deed , as the common people express it . I believe that there was an intermarriage between the Brownings and the Hamleys , a generation or two ago . "
82000	82006	82008	82008	Roger	203	" I daresay there was , "
82010	82033	82008	82008	Roger	203	" My mother is very delicate , and obliged to humour her health , which has made her keep aloof from society . "
82034	82040	82042	82042	Molly	147	" Then I may go ? "
82069	82098	82008	82008	Roger	203	" To be sure , my dear . Write a pretty note , and tell Mrs. Hamley how much obliged to her we are for thinking of us . "
82099	82111	82113	82113	Roger	203	" I 'm afraid I ca n't wait for a note , "
82115	82142	82113	82113	Roger	203	" I must take a message instead , for I have to meet my father at one o'clock , and it 's close upon it now . "
82242	82290	82232	82232	her	159	" Such a fine - looking young man , and so courteous and affable . Like the young men of our youth now , is he not , sister ? And yet they all say Mr. Osborne is the handsomest . What do you think , child ? "
82291	82299	82301	82301	Molly	147	" I 've never seen Mr. Osborne , "
82558	82615	82541	82541	his	7200	" Yes ! I 'm back again . Bullocks , I find , are not in my line . I only disappointed my father in not being able to appreciate their merits , and , I 'm afraid , I did n't care to learn . And the smell was insufferable on such a hot day . "
82616	82673	82541	82541	his	7200	" My dear boy , do n't make apologies to me ; keep them for your father . I 'm only too glad to have you back . Miss Gibson , this tall fellow is my son Osborne , as I daresay you have guessed . Osborne Miss Gibson . Now , what will you have ? "
82684	82688	82690	82690	he	2579	" Nothing here , "
82692	82708	82690	82690	he	2579	" Is n't there some cold game - pie ? I 'll ring for that . "
83104	83108	83110	83111	the Squire	1206	" Osborne here ! "
83117	83255	83110	83111	the Squire	1206	" Why the deuce could n't you tell us you were coming home ? I looked about for you everywhere , just as we were going into the ordinary . I wanted to introduce you to Grantley , and Fox , and Lord Forrest men from the other side of the county , whom you ought to know ; and Roger there missed above half his dinner hunting about for you ; and all the time you 'd stole away , and were quietly sitting here with the women . I wish you 'd let me know the next time you make off . I 've lost half my pleasure in looking at as fine a lot of cattle as I ever saw , with thinking you might be having one of your old attacks of faintness . "
83256	83286	83395	83395	Roger	203	" I should have had one , I think , if I 'd stayed longer in that atmosphere . But I 'm sorry if I 've caused you anxiety . "
83287	83292	83294	83295	the Squire	1206	" Well ! well ! "
83300	83321	83294	83295	the Squire	1206	" And Roger , too , there I 've been sending him here and sending him there all the afternoon . "
83322	83358	83360	83360	Roger	203	" I did n't mind it , sir . I was only sorry you were so uneasy . I thought Osborne had gone home , for I knew it was n't much in his way , "
83407	83427	83395	83395	Roger	203	" Well , and how are you getting on with Huber ; do n't you find him very interesting ? "
83428	83433	83435	83435	Molly	147	" I 'm afraid , "
83439	83499	83435	83435	Molly	147	" I have n't read much . Miss Brownings like me to talk ; and , besides , there is so much to do at home before papa comes back ; and Miss Browning does n't like me to go without her . I know it sounds nothing , but it does take up a great deal of time . "
83500	83508	83395	83395	Roger	203	" When is your father coming back ? "
83509	83523	83435	83435	Molly	147	" Next Tuesday , I believe . He can not stay long away . "
83524	83537	83539	83539	he	2600	" I shall ride over and pay my respects to Mrs. Gibson , "
83541	83584	83585	83585	he	2600	" I shall come as soon as I may . Your father has been a very kind friend to me ever since I was a boy . And when I come , I shall expect my pupil to have been very diligent , "
83655	83737	83651	83651	Molly	147	" Oh , Molly ! I thought you 'd never come back . Such a piece of news ! Sister has gone to bed ; she 's had a headache with the excitement , I think ; but she says it 's new bread . Come upstairs softly , my dear , and I 'll tell you what it is ! Who do you think has been here , drinking tea with us , too , in the most condescending manner ? "
83738	83742	83744	83744	Molly	147	" Lady Harriet ? "
83751	83754	83744	83744	Molly	147	" condescending . "
83755	84242	83651	83651	Molly	147	" Yes . Why , how did you guess it ? But , after all , her call , at any rate in the first instance , was upon you . Oh , dear Molly ! if you 're not in a hurry to go to bed , let me sit down quietly and tell you all about it ; for my heart jumps into my mouth still when I think of how I was caught . She that is , her ladyship left the carriage at ' The George , ' and took to her feet to go shopping just as you or I may have done many a time in our lives . And sister was taking her forty winks ; and I was sitting with my gown up above my knees and my feet on the fender , pulling out my grandmother 's lace which I 'd been washing . The worst has yet to be told . I 'd taken off my cap , for I thought it was getting dusk and no one would come , and there was I in my black silk skull - cap , when Nancy put her head in , and whispered , ' There 's a lady downstairs a real grand one , by her talk ; ' and in there came my Lady Harriet , so sweet and pretty in her ways , it was some time before I remembered I had never a cap on . Sister never wakened ; or never roused up , so to say . She says she thought it was Nancy bringing in the tea when she heard some one moving ; for her ladyship , as soon as she saw the state of the case , came and knelt down on the rug by me , and begged my pardon so prettily for having followed Nancy upstairs without waiting for permission ; and was so taken by my old lace , and wanted to know how I washed it , and where you were , and when you 'd be back , and when the happy couple would be back : till sister wakened she 's always a little bit put out , you know , when she first wakens from her afternoon nap , and , without turning her head to see who it was , she said , quite sharp , ' Buzz , buzz , buzz ! When will you learn that whispering is more fidgeting than talking out loud ? I 've not been able to sleep at all for the chatter you and Nancy have been keeping up all this time . ' You know that was a little fancy of sister 's , for she 'd been snoring away as naturally as could be . So I went to her , and leant over her , and said in a low voice ,
84243	84258	83744	83744	Molly	147	" ' Sister , it 's her ladyship and me that has been conversing . '
84259	84289	83651	83651	Molly	147	" ' Ladyship here , ladyship there ! have you lost your wits , Phobe , that you talk such nonsense and in your skull - cap , too ! '
84290	84801	83744	83744	Molly	147	" By this time she was sitting up and , looking round her , she saw Lady Harriet , in her velvets and silks , sitting on our rug , smiling , her bonnet off , and her pretty hair all bright with the blaze of the fire . My word ! sister was up on her feet directly ; and she dropped her curtsey , and made her excuses for sleeping , as fast as might be , while I went off to put on my best cap , for sister might well say I was out of my wits to go on chatting to an earl 's daughter in an old black silk skull - cap . Black silk , too ! when , if I 'd only known she was coming , I might have put on my new brown silk one , lying idle in my top drawer . And when I came back , sister was ordering tea for her ladyship , our tea , I mean . So I took my turn at talk , and sister slipped out to put on her Sunday silk . But I do n't think we were quite so much at our ease with her ladyship as when I sat pulling out my lace in my skull - cap . And she was quite struck with our tea , and asked where we got it , for she had never tasted any like it before ; and I told her we gave only 3s . 4d . a pound for it , at Johnson 's sister says I ought to have told her the price of our company - tea , which is 5s . a pound , only that was not what we were drinking ; for , as ill - luck would have it , we 'd none of it in the house and she said she would send us some of hers , all the way from Russia or Prussia , or some out - of - the - way place , and we were to compare and see which we liked best ; and if we liked hers best , she could get it for us at 3s . a pound . And she left her love for you ; and , though she was going away , you were not to forget her . Sister thought such a message would set you up too much , and told me she would not be chargeable for the giving it you . ' But , ' I said , ' a message is a message , and it 's on Molly 's own shoulders if she 's set up by it . Let us show her an example of humility , sister , though we have been sitting cheek - by - jowl in such company . ' So sister humphed , and said she 'd a headache , and went to bed . And now you may tell me your news , my dear . "
84874	84877	84870	84871	Warwickshire people	2607	" unked , "
84915	84938	84942	84942	Molly	147	" which tripped 'em up , and threw 'em down , and was cold to the feet , and smelt just abominable . "
85106	85119	85156	85156	she	147	" Molly , my dear , show your mamma to her room ! "
85160	85163	85156	85156	she	147	" mamma ? "
85251	85273	85223	85223	She	147	" Now , my love , we can embrace each other in peace . O dear , how tired I am ! "
85281	85367	85223	85223	She	147	" My spirits are so easily affected with fatigue ; but your dear papa has been kindness itself . Dear ! what an old - fashioned bed ! And what a But it does n't signify . By - and - by we 'll renovate the house wo n't we , my dear ? And you 'll be my little maid to - night , and help me to arrange a few things , for I 'm just worn out with the day 's journey . "
85368	85384	85386	85386	Molly	147	" I 've ordered a sort of tea - dinner to be ready for you , "
85388	85400	85386	85386	Molly	147	" Shall I go and tell them to send it in ? "
85401	85492	85223	85223	She	147	" I 'm not sure if I can go down again to - night . It would be very comfortable to have a little table brought in here , and sit in my dressing - gown by this cheerful fire . But , to be sure , there 's your dear papa ? I really do n't think he would eat anything if I were not there . One must not think about oneself , you know . Yes , I 'll come down in a quarter of an hour . "
85819	85866	85808	85808	Molly	147	" I feel so lonely , darling , in this strange house ; do come and be with me , and help me to unpack . I think your dear papa might have put off his visit to Mr. Craven Smith for just this one evening . "
85867	85878	85880	85880	Molly	147	" Mr. Craven Smith could n't put off his dying , "
85884	85889	85891	85892	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You droll girl ! "
85899	85941	85891	85892	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But if this Mr. Smith is dying , as you say , what 's the use of your father 's going off to him in such a hurry ? Does he expect any legacy , or anything of that kind ? "
85958	86003	85954	85954	She	147	" I do n't quite know that he is dying . The man said so ; and papa can sometimes do something to make the last struggle easier . At any rate , it 's always a comfort to the family to have him . "
86004	86047	85954	85954	She	147	" What dreary knowledge of death you have learned for a girl of your age ! Really , if I had heard all these details of your father 's profession , I doubt if I could have brought myself to have him ! "
86048	86107	85954	85954	She	147	" He does n't make the illness or the death ; he does his best against them . I call it a very fine thing to think of what he does or tries to do . And you will think so , too , when you see how he is watched for , and how people welcome him ! "
86108	86174	85954	85954	She	147	" Well , do n't let us talk any more of such gloomy things , to - night ! I think I shall go to bed at once , I am so tired , if you will only sit by me till I get sleepy , darling . If you will talk to me , the sound of your voice will soon send me off . "
86328	86335	86337	86337	she	147	" How is Mr. Craven Smith ? "
86339	86359	86310	86310	she	147	" Dead . He just recognized me . He was one of my first patients on coming to Hollingford . "
86418	86426	86413	86413	he	675	" And where 's the new mamma ? "
86427	86450	86413	86413	he	675	" She was tired , and went to bed early . Oh , papa ! must I call her ' mamma ? ' "
86451	86457	86459	86459	he	675	" I should like it , "
86498	86557	86492	86492	he	675	" Why should n't you call her ' mamma ? ' I 'm sure she means to do the duty of a mother to you . We all may make mistakes , and her ways may not be quite all at once our ways ; but at any rate let us start with a family bond between us . "
86607	86610	86602	86602	she	160	" mamma . "
86713	86724	86710	86710	she	147	" Papa , I will call her ' mamma ! ' "
86750	86775	86747	86747	he	675	" You wo n't be sorry for it , Molly , when you come to lie as poor Craven Smith did to - night . "
86816	86867	86799	86800	her father	675	" You do n't like Mrs. Gibson 's ringing her bell so often , do n't you ? You 've been spoilt , I 'm afraid ; but if you do n't conform to my wife 's desires , you have the remedy in your own hands , you know . "
87063	87091	87058	87058	he	238	" I wish you 'd ask your mamma if Betty might not stay , if she made a proper apology , and all that sort of thing . "
87092	87105	87107	87107	Molly	147	" I do n't much think it will be of any use , "
87114	87134	87107	87107	Molly	147	" I know she is writing , or has written , about some under - housemaid at the Towers . "
87135	87211	87058	87058	he	238	" Well ! all I want is peace and a decent quantity of cheerfulness when I come home . I see enough of tears at other people 's houses . After all , Betty has been with us sixteen years a sort of service of the antique world . But the woman may be happier elsewhere . Do as you like about asking mamma ; only if she agrees , I shall be quite willing . "
87249	87362	87374	87374	she	2664	" My dear girl , I should never have thought of sending an old servant away , one who has had the charge of you from your birth , or nearly so . I could not have had the heart to do it . She might have stayed for ever for me , if she had only attended to all my wishes ; and I am not unreasonable , am I ? But , you see , she complained ; and when your dear papa spoke to her , she gave warning ; and it is quite against my principles ever to take an apology from a servant who has given warning . "
87363	87369	87371	87371	Molly	147	" She is so sorry , "
87396	87396	87374	87374	she	2664	"
87397	87544	87374	87374	she	2664	" But , sweet one , you seem to forget that I can not go against my principles , however much I may be sorry for Betty . She should not have given way to ill - temper . As I said before , although I never liked her , and considered her a most inefficient servant , thoroughly spoilt by having had no mistress for so long , I should have borne with her at least , I think I should as long as I could . Now I have all but engaged Maria , who was under - housemaid at the Towers , so do n't let me hear any more of Betty 's sorrow , or anybody else 's sorrow , for I 'm sure , what with your dear papa 's sad stories and other things , I 'm getting quite low . "
87554	87561	87563	87563	she	147	" Have you quite engaged Maria ? "
87565	87588	87590	87591	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No I said ' all but engaged . ' Sometimes one would think you did not hear things , dear Molly ! "
87595	87707	87590	87591	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Maria is living in a place where they do n't give her as much wages as she deserves . Perhaps they ca n't afford it , poor things ! I 'm always sorry for poverty , and would never speak hardly of those who are not rich ; but I have offered her two pounds more than she gets at present , so I think she 'll leave . At any rate , if they increase her wages , I shall increase my offer in proportion ; so I think I 'm sure to get her . Such a genteel girl ! always brings in a letter on a salver ! "
87708	87712	87714	87714	Molly	147	" Poor Betty ! "
87718	87736	87739	87740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Poor old soul ! I hope she 'll profit by the lesson , I 'm sure , "
87742	87760	87739	87740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" but it 's a pity we had n't Maria before the county families began to call . "
87774	87779	87780	87780	Her	189	" from county families . "
88108	88142	88246	88247	the cook	1908	" Do n't get any dainties for me , my dear ; bread - and - cheese is the chief of my diet , like it was that of the old woman 's . "
88143	88152	88154	88155	his wife	995	" I know nothing of your old woman , "
88157	88171	88154	88155	his wife	995	" but really I can not allow cheese to come beyond the kitchen . "
88172	88180	88182	88182	he	1223	" Then I 'll eat it there , "
88184	88210	88182	88182	he	1223	" It 's close to the stable - yard , and if I come in in a hurry I can get it in a moment . "
88211	88244	88154	88155	his wife	995	" Really , Mr. Gibson , it is astonishing to compare your appearance and manners with your tastes . You look such a gentleman , as dear Lady Cumnor used to say . "
88793	88798	88800	88801	Mr. Gibson	238	" Not at all , "
88805	88896	88800	88801	Mr. Gibson	238	" You are both of you too young to know your own minds ; and if my daughter was silly enough to be in love , she should never have to calculate her happiness on the chances of an old man 's death . I dare say he 'll disinherit you after all . He may do , and then you 'd be worse off than ever . No ! go away , and forget all this nonsense ; and when you 've done , come back and see us ! "

89793	89801	89803	89803	he	203	" You think my brother looking ill ? "
89809	89814	89806	89806	his	203	" No not exactly . "
89815	89859	89806	89806	his	203	" He is not well . Both my father and I are anxious about him . That run on the Continent did him harm , instead of good ; and his disappointment at his examination has told upon him , I 'm afraid . "
89860	89873	89806	89806	his	203	" I was not thinking he looked ill ; only changed somehow . "
89874	89918	89806	89806	his	203	" He says he must go back to Cambridge soon . Possibly it may do him good ; and I shall be off next week . This is a farewell visit to you , as well as one of congratulation to Mrs. Gibson . "
89919	89947	89806	89806	his	203	" Your mother will feel your both going away , wo n't she ? But of course young men will always have to live away from home . "
89948	89951	89952	89952	he	2747	" Yes , "
89955	89993	89952	89952	he	2747	" Still she feels it a good deal ; and I 'm not satisfied about her health either . You will go out and see her sometimes , will you ? she is very fond of you . "
89994	89999	90001	90001	Molly	147	" If I may , "
90043	90051	90053	90053	he	2747	" Do you want any more books ? "
90055	90098	90053	90053	he	2747	" If you do , make a list out , and send it to my mother before I leave , next Tuesday . After I am gone , there will be no one to go into the library and pick them out . "
90117	90225	90109	90109	her	189	" I do like that Osborne Hamley ! What a nice fellow he is ! Somehow , I always do like eldest sons . He will have the estate , wo n't he ? I shall ask your dear papa to encourage him to come about the house . He will be a very good , very pleasant acquaintance for you and Cynthia . The other is but a loutish young fellow , to my mind ; there is no aristocratic bearing about him . I suppose he takes after his mother , who is but a parvenue , I 've heard them say at the Towers . "
90237	90264	90109	90109	her	189	" I think I 've heard her father was a Russian merchant , and imported tallow and hemp . Mr. Osborne Hamley is extremely like her . "
90265	90297	90109	90109	her	189	" Indeed ! But there 's no calculating these things . Anyhow , he is the perfect gentleman in appearance and manner . The estate is entailed , is it not ? "
90298	90305	90307	90307	Molly	147	" I know nothing about it , "
90319	90387	90315	90316	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do you know , I almost think I must get dear papa to give a little dinner - party , and ask Mr. Osborne Hamley ? I should like to have him feel at home in this house . It would be something cheerful for him after the dulness and solitude of Hamley Hall . For the old people do n't visit much , I believe ? "
90388	90398	90400	90400	Molly	147	" He 's going back to Cambridge next week , "
90402	90440	90109	90109	her	189	" Is he ? Well , then , we 'll put off our little dinner till Cynthia comes home . I should like to have some young society for her , poor darling , when she returns . "
90441	90447	90449	90449	Molly	147	" When is she coming ? "
90464	90523	90109	90109	her	189	" Oh ! I 'm not sure ; perhaps at the new year perhaps not till Easter . I must get this drawing - room all new furnished first ; and then I mean to fit up her room and yours just alike . They are just the same size , only on opposite sides of the passage . "
90524	90535	90537	90537	Molly	147	" Are you going to new - furnish that room ? "
90548	90564	90109	90109	her	189	" Yes ; and yours , too , darling ; so do n't be jealous . "
90565	90575	90577	90577	Molly	147	" Oh , please , mamma , not mine , "
90588	90636	90109	90109	her	189	" Yes , dear ! You shall have yours done as well . A little French bed , and a new paper , and a pretty carpet , and a dressed - up toilet - table and glass , will make it look quite a different place . "
90637	90663	90109	90109	her	189	" But I do n't want it to look different . I like it as it is . Pray do n't do anything to it . "
90664	90695	90109	90109	her	189	" What nonsense , child ! I never heard anything more ridiculous ! Most girls would be glad to get rid of furniture only fit for the lumber - room . "
90696	90708	90710	90710	Molly	147	" It was my own mamma 's before she was married , "
90746	90877	90743	90743	she	189	" It 's very much to your credit that you should have such feelings , I 'm sure . But do n't you think sentiment may be carried too far ? Why , we should have no new furniture at all , and should have to put up with worm - eaten horrors . Besides , my dear , Hollingford will seem very dull to Cynthia , after pretty , gay France , and I want to make the first impressions attractive . I 've a notion I can settle her down near here ; and I want her to come in a good temper ; for , between ourselves , my dear , she is a little , leetle wilful . You need not mention this to your papa . "
90878	90897	90743	90743	she	189	" But ca n't you do Cynthia 's room , and not mine ? Please let mine alone . "
90898	90937	90743	90743	she	189	" No , indeed ! I could n't agree to that . Only think what would be said of me by everybody ; petting my own child and neglecting my husband 's ! I could n't bear it . "
90938	90944	90743	90743	she	189	" No one need know . "
90945	91045	90743	90743	she	189	" In such a tittle - tattle place as Hollingford ! Really , Molly , you are either very stupid or very obstinate , or else you do n't care what hard things may be said about me : and all for a selfish fancy of your own ! No ! I owe myself the justice of acting in this matter as I please . Every one shall know I 'm not a common stepmother . Every penny I spend on Cynthia I shall spend on you too ; so it 's no use talking any more about it . "

91646	91700	91569	91570	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And you suppose you know her ways better than I do who have known her these fifteen years ? I tell you she turns every one into ridicule who does not belong to her set . Why , she used always to speak of Miss Brownings as ' Pecksy and Flapsy . ' "
91701	91709	91711	91711	Molly	147	" She promised me she would not , "
91716	91728	91569	91570	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Promised you ! Lady Harriet ? What do you mean ? "
91729	91770	91569	91570	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Only she spoke of them as Pecksy and Flapsy and when she talked of coming to call on me at their house , I asked her not to come if she was going to to make fun of them . "
91771	91794	91569	91570	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Upon my word ! with all my long acquaintance with Lady Harriet , I should never have ventured on such impertinence . "
91795	91804	91806	91806	Molly	147	" I did n't mean it as impertinence , "
91809	91822	91806	91806	Molly	147	" And I do n't think Lady Harriet took it as such . "
91823	91841	91569	91570	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You ca n't know anything about it . She can put on any kind of manner . "
92053	92255	92036	92036	he	199	" Molly , we are all wrong at home ! Osborne has lost the fellowship at Trinity he went back to try for . Then he has gone and failed miserably in his degree , after all that he said , and that his mother said ; and I , like a fool , went and boasted about my clever son . I ca n't understand it . I never expected anything extraordinary from Roger ; but Osborne ! And then it has thrown madam into one of her bad fits of illness ; and she seems to have a fancy for you , child ! Your father came to see her this morning . Poor thing , she 's very poorly , I 'm afraid ; and she told him how she should like to have you about her , and he said I might fetch you . You 'll come , wo n't you , my dear ? She 's not a poor woman , such as many people think it 's the only charity to be kind to , but she 's just as forlorn of woman 's care as if she was poor worse , I daresay . "
92256	92265	92267	92267	Molly	147	" I 'll be ready in ten minutes , "
92336	92345	92308	92309	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear , where are you going ? "
92346	92359	92361	92361	Molly	147	" Mrs. Hamley wants me , and papa says I may go , "
92373	92421	92369	92370	the Squire	1206	" My wife is ill , and as she 's very fond of your daughter , she begged Mr. Gibson to allow her to come to the Hall for a little while , and he kindly said she might , and I 'm come to fetch her . "
92422	92429	92431	92432	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Stop a minute , darling , "
92449	92473	92475	92475	she	147	" I am sure dear papa quite forgot that you were to go out with me to - night , to visit people , "
92483	92520	92475	92475	she	147	" with whom I am quite unacquainted and it is very uncertain if Mr. Gibson can return in time to accompany me so , you see , I can not allow Molly to go with you . "
92521	92577	92613	92613	he	2788	" I should n't have thought it would have signified . Brides are always brides , I suppose ; and it 's their part to be timid ; but I should n't have thought it in this case . And my wife sets her heart on things , as sick people do . Well , Molly "
92592	92612	92613	92613	he	2788	" we must put it off till to - morrow : and it 's our loss , not yours , "
92630	92645	92693	92693	she	189	" You 'll be as gay as can be to - night , I daresay "
92646	92653	92656	92656	Molly	147	" No , I shall not , "
92658	92675	92656	92656	Molly	147	" I never wanted to go , and now I shall want it less than ever . "
92676	92682	92684	92685	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Hush , my dear , "
92696	92762	92693	92693	she	189	" The visiting here is not all one could wish for so young a girl no young people , no dances , nothing of gaiety ; but it is wrong in you , Molly , to speak against such kind friends of your father 's as I understand these Cockerells are . Do n't give so bad an impression of yourself to the kind Squire . "
92763	92772	92693	92693	she	189	" Let her alone ! let her alone ! "
92776	92815	92693	92693	she	189	" I see what she means . She 'd rather come and be in my wife 's sick - room than go out for this visit to - night . Is there no way of getting her off ? "
92816	92820	92822	92823	Mrs. Gibson	189	" None whatever , "
92825	92861	92822	92823	Mrs. Gibson	189	" An engagement is an engagement with me ; and I consider that she is not only engaged to Mrs. Cockerell , but to me bound to accompany me , in my husband 's absence . "
92995	93059	92988	92988	he	1206	" Well ! it 's no use . Poor madam ; she wo n't like it . She 'll be disappointed ! But it 's but for one evening ! but for one evening ! She may come to - morrow , may n't she ? Or will the dissipation of such an evening as she describes , be too much for her ? "
93078	93116	93068	93068	his	1206	" She shall be ready at any time you name . I am so sorry : my foolish shyness is in fault , I believe ; but still you must acknowledge that an engagement is an engagement . "
93117	93199	93068	93068	his	1206	" Did I ever say an engagement was an elephant , madam ? However , there 's no use saying any more about it , or I shall forget my manners . I 'm an old tyrant , and she lying there in bed , poor girl has always given me my own way . So you 'll excuse me , Mrs. Gibson , wo n't you ; and let Molly come along with me at ten to - morrow morning ? "
93200	93203	93205	93206	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Certainly , "
93222	93306	93217	93217	she	189	" Now , my dear , I must never have you exposing me to the ill - manners of such a man again ! I do n't call him a squire ; I call him a boor , or a yeoman at best . You must not go on accepting or rejecting invitations as if you were an independent young lady , Molly . Pay me the respect of a reference to my wishes another time , if you please , my dear ! "
93307	93315	93317	93317	Molly	147	" Papa had said I might go , "
93323	93420	93217	93217	she	189	" As I am now your mamma , your references must be to me , for the future . But as you are to go you may as well look well dressed . I will lend you my new shawl for this visit , if you like it , and my set of green ribbons . I am always indulgent when proper respect is paid to me . And in such a house as Hamley Hall , no one can tell who may be coming and going , even if there is sickness in the family . "
93421	93461	93462	93462	Molly	147	" Thank you . But I do n't want the shawl and the ribbons , please : there will be nobody there except the family . There never is , I think ; and now that she is so ill "
93570	93586	93587	93587	she	189	" What can I do for you , to bring you back into good temper ? "
93590	93736	93587	93587	she	189	" First , you insist upon your knowing Lady Harriet better than I do I , who have known her for eighteen or nineteen years at least . Then you jump at invitations without ever consulting me , or thinking of how awkward it would be for me to go stumping into a drawing - room all by myself ; following my new name , too , which always makes me feel uncomfortable , it is such a sad come - down after Kirkpatrick ! And then , when I offer you some of the prettiest things I have got , you say it does not signify how you are dressed . What can I do to please you , Molly ? I , who delight in nothing more than peace in a family , to see you sitting there with despair upon your face ? "
94029	94032	94037	94037	she	147	" madam 's "
94079	94086	94072	94073	The Squire	1206	" Here she is at last ! "
94277	94286	94288	94289	the Squire	1206	" She is not so well this morning , "
94295	94330	94331	94331	he	1206	" But never fear , my dear one ; here 's the doctor 's daughter , nearly as good as the doctor himself . Have you had your medicine ? Your beef - tea ? "
94404	94493	94393	94393	she	205	" Now , dear child , tell me all ; it 's no breach of confidence , for I sha n't mention it again , and I sha n't be here long . How does it all go on the new mother , the good resolutions ? let me help you if I can . I think with a girl I could have been of use a mother does not know boys . But tell me anything you like and will ; do n't be afraid of details . "
94606	94617	94601	94602	Mrs. Hamley	205	" And you and Mrs. Gibson get on happily together ? "
94618	94622	94624	94624	Molly	147	" Not always , "
94626	94645	94624	94624	Molly	147	" You know we did n't know much of each other before we were put to live together . "
94646	94664	94601	94602	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I did n't like what the Squire told me last night . He was very angry . "
94691	94699	94701	94702	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Ah ! I see , Molly , "
94704	94726	94701	94702	Mrs. Hamley	205	" you wo n't tell me your sorrows , and yet , perhaps , I could have done you some good . "
94727	94733	94735	94735	Molly	147	" I do n't like , "
94742	94790	94735	94735	Molly	147	" I think papa would n't like it . And , besides , you have helped me so much you and Mr. Roger Hamley . I often think of the things he said ; they come in so usefully , and are such a strength to me . "
94791	94851	94859	94860	the maid	2823	" Ah , Roger ! yes . He is to be trusted . Oh , Molly ! I 've a great deal to say to you myself , only not now . I must have my medicine and try to go to sleep . Good girl ! You are stronger than I am , and can do without sympathy . "
94980	95466	94977	94977	she	205	" Osborne has so disappointed us ! I can not understand it yet . And the Squire was so terribly angry ! I can not think how all the money was spent advances through money - lenders , besides bills . The Squire does not show me how angry he is now , because he 's afraid of another attack ; but I know how angry he is . You see he has been spending ever so much money in reclaiming that land at Upton Common , and is very hard pressed himself . But it would have doubled the value of the estate , and so we never thought anything of economies which would benefit Osborne in the long run . And now the Squire says he must mortgage some of the land ; and you ca n't think how it cuts him to the heart . He sold a great deal of timber to send the two boys to college . Osborne oh ! what a dear , innocent boy he was : he was the heir , you know ; and he was so clever , every one said he was sure of honours and a fellowship , and I do n't know what all ; and he did get a scholarship , and then all went wrong . I do n't know how . That is the worst . Perhaps the Squire wrote too angrily , and that stopped up confidence . But he might have told me . He would have done , I think , Molly , if he had been here , face to face with me . But the Squire , in his anger , told him not to show his face at home till he had paid off the debts he had incurred out of his allowance . Out of two hundred and fifty a year to pay off more than nine hundred , one way or another ! And not to come home till then ! Perhaps Roger will have debts too ! He had but two hundred ; but , then , he was not the eldest son . The Squire has given orders that the men are to be turned off the draining - works ; and I lie awake thinking of their poor families this wintry weather . But what shall we do ? I 've never been strong , and , perhaps , I 've been extravagant in my habits ; and there were family traditions as to expenditure , and the reclaiming of this land . Oh ! Molly , Osborne was such a sweet little baby , and such a loving boy : so clever , too ! You know I read you some of his poetry : now , could a person who wrote like that do anything very wrong ? And yet I 'm afraid he has . "
95467	95482	95484	95484	Molly	147	" Do n't you know , at all , how the money has gone ? "
95486	95623	95624	95624	she	147	" No ! not at all . That 's the sting . There are tailors ' bills , and bills for book - binding and wine and pictures those come to four or five hundred ; and though this expenditure is extraordinary inexplicable to such simple folk as we are yet it may be only the luxury of the present day . But the money for which he will give no account , of which , indeed , we only heard through the Squire 's London agents , who found out that certain disreputable attorneys were making inquiries as to the entail of the estate ; oh ! Molly , worse than all I do n't know how to bring myself to tell you as to the age and health of the Squire , his dear father "
95647	95710	95632	95632	she	147	" who held him in his arms , and blessed him , even before I had kissed him ; and thought always so much of him as his heir and first - born darling . How he has loved him ! How I have loved him ! I sometimes have thought of late that we 've almost done that good Roger injustice . "
95711	95759	95761	95761	Molly	147	" No ! I 'm sure you 've not : only look at the way he loves you . Why , you are his first thought : he may not speak about it , but any one may see it . And dear , dear Mrs. Hamley , "
95782	95840	95761	95761	Molly	147	" do n't you think that it would be better not to misjudge Mr. Osborne Hamley ? We do n't know what he has done with the money : he is so good is he not ? that he may have wanted it to relieve some poor person some tradesman , for instance , pressed by creditors some "
95841	95847	95849	95850	Mrs. Hamley	205	" You forget , dear , "
95868	95889	95849	95850	Mrs. Hamley	205	" that all the other bills come from tradesmen , who complain piteously of being kept out of their money . "
95902	95932	95899	95899	she	147	" I daresay they imposed upon him . I 'm sure I 've heard stories of young men being made regular victims of by the shopkeepers in great towns . "
95933	95942	95944	95945	Mrs. Hamley	205	" You 're a great darling , child , "
95961	95966	95968	95968	Molly	147	" And , besides , "
96007	96007	95981	95982	Osborne Hamley	205	"
96008	96081	96005	96006	Mr. Osborne	230	" Never mind , Molly , what you call him ; only go on talking . It seems to do me good to hear the hopeful side taken . The Squire has been so hurt and displeased : strange - looking men coming into the neighbourhood , too , questioning the tenants , and grumbling about the last fall of timber , as if they were calculating on the Squire 's death . "
96082	96127	95981	95982	Osborne Hamley	205	" That 's just what I was going to speak about . Does n't it show that they are bad men ? and would bad men scruple to impose upon him , and to tell lies in his name , and to ruin him ? "
96128	96145	96005	96006	Mr. Osborne	230	" Do n't you see , you only make him out weak , instead of wicked ? "
96146	96224	95981	95982	Osborne Hamley	205	" Yes ; perhaps I do . But I do n't think he is weak . You know yourself , dear Mrs. Hamley , how very clever he really is . Besides , I would rather he was weak than wicked . Weak people may find themselves all at once strong in heaven , when they see things quite clearly ; but I do n't think the wicked will turn themselves into virtuous people all at once . "
96225	96236	96238	96239	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I think I 've been very weak , Molly , "
96247	96291	96238	96239	Mrs. Hamley	205	" I 've made such an idol of my beautiful Osborne ; and he turns out to have feet of clay , not strong enough to stand firm on the ground . And that 's the best view of his conduct , too ! "
96464	96594	96458	96458	his	2838	" You see , miss , me and cook had planned a dinner as would tempt master to eat ; but when you say , ' No , thank you , ' when I hand you anything , master never so much as looks at it . But if you takes a thing , and eats with a relish , why first he waits , and then he looks , and by - and - by he smells ; and then he finds out as he 's hungry , and falls to eating as natural as a kitten takes to mewing . That 's the reason , miss , as I gave you a nudge and a wink , which no one knows better nor me was not manners . "
96706	96801	96680	96680	he	1206	" It 's nonsense thinking her so ill as that you know it 's only the delicacy she 's had for years ; and if you ca n't do her any good in such a simple case no pain only weakness and nervousness it is a simple case , eh ? do n't look in that puzzled way , man ! you 'd better give her up altogether , and I 'll take her to Bath or Brighton , or somewhere for change , for in my opinion it 's only moping and nervousness . "
96843	96900	96837	96838	Mr. Gibson	238	" I shall go on coming to see her , and I know you 'll not forbid my visits . But I shall bring Dr. Nicholls with me the next time I come . I may be mistaken in my treatment ; and I wish to God he may say I am mistaken in my apprehensions . "
96901	96914	96916	96917	the Squire	1206	" Do n't tell me them ! I can not bear them ! "
96919	97039	96916	96917	the Squire	1206	" Of course we must all die ; and she must too . But the cleverest doctor in England sha n't go about coolly meting out the life of such as her . I daresay I shall die first . I hope I shall . But I 'll knock any one down who speaks to me of death sitting within me . And , besides , I think all doctors are ignorant quacks , pretending to knowledge they have n't got . Ay , you may smile at me . I do n't care . Unless you can tell me I shall die first , neither you nor your Dr. Nicholls shall come prophesying and croaking about this house . "
97343	97361	97337	97338	Mr. Gibson	238	" Molly ! I 've written to Osborne and Roger . Do you know Osborne 's address ? "
97362	97390	97337	97338	Mr. Gibson	238	" No , papa . He 's in disgrace . I do n't know if the Squire knows ; and she has been too ill to write . "
97391	97509	97337	97338	Mr. Gibson	238	" Never mind . I 'll enclose it to Roger ; whatever those lads may be to others , there 's as strong brotherly love as ever I saw , between the two . Roger will know . And , Molly , they are sure to come home as soon as they hear my report of their mother 's state . I wish you 'd tell the Squire what I 've done . It 's not a pleasant piece of work ; and I 'll tell madam myself in my own way . I 'd have told him if he 'd been at home ; but you say he was obliged to go to Ashcombe on business . "
97510	97543	97544	97544	Molly	147	" Quite obliged . He was so sorry to miss you . But , papa , he will be so angry ! You do n't know how mad he is against Osborne . "
97616	97619	97621	97621	he	199	" opinions , "
98118	98166	98115	98115	Molly	147	" When papa was here to - day , he bade me tell you he had written to Mr. Roger Hamley to say that that he thought he had better come home ; and he enclosed a letter to Mr. Osborne Hamley to say the same thing . "
98183	98191	98192	98192	he	199	" He sent for Osborne and Roger ? "
98201	98204	98198	98198	Molly	147	" Yes . "
98240	98252	98254	98254	he	199	" Roger would have been down from Cambridge on the 18th , "
98256	98270	98271	98271	he	199	" And he has sent for Osborne , too ! Did he know , "
98301	98330	98295	98295	he	199	" It 's right , quite right . I understand . It has come at length . Come ! come ! Osborne has brought it on , though , "
98341	98345	98338	98338	his	199	" She might have "
98357	98359	98352	98352	she	147	" lingered "
98360	98375	98352	98352	she	147	" but for that . I ca n't forgive him ; I can not . "
98405	98449	98400	98400	his	199	" Go to her , my dear ; I can not not just yet . But I will soon . Just this bit ; and after that I wo n't lose a moment . You 're a good girl . God bless you ! "
98515	98519	98498	98499	Mrs. Gibson	189	" right of way "
98524	98538	98539	98540	her father	675	" You shall come back to - morrow , or the next day , "
98544	98570	98539	98540	her father	675	" But mamma seems to think people will put a bad construction on your being so much away from home so soon after our marriage . "
98571	98593	98539	98539	her	147	" Oh , papa , I 'm afraid Mrs. Hamley will miss me ! I do so like being with her . "
98594	98651	98539	98540	her father	675	" I do n't think it is likely she will miss you as much as she would have done a month or two ago . She sleeps so much now , that she is scarcely conscious of the lapse of time . I 'll see that you come back here again in a day or two . "
98739	98795	98721	98721	her	189	" What a time she lingers ! Your papa never expected she would last half so long after that attack . It must be very wearing work to them all ; I declare you look quite another creature since you were there . One can only wish it may n't last , for their sakes . "
98796	98808	98810	98810	Molly	147	" You do n't know how the Squire values every minute , "
98812	98997	98721	98721	her	189	" Why , you say she sleeps a great deal , and does n't talk much when she 's awake , and there 's not the slightest hope for her . And yet , at such times , people are kept on the tenter - hooks with watching and waiting . I know it by my dear Kirkpatrick . There really were days when I thought it never would end . But we wo n't talk any more of such dismal things ; you 've had quite enough of them , I 'm sure , and it always makes me melancholy to hear of illness and death ; and yet your papa seems sometimes as if he could talk of nothing else . I 'm going to take you out to - night , though , and that will give you something of a change ; and I 've been getting Miss Rose to trim up one of my old gowns for you ; it 's too tight for me . There 's some talk of dancing , it 's at Mrs. Edwards ' . "
98998	99008	99010	99010	Molly	147	" Oh , mamma , I can not go ! "
99012	99037	99010	99010	Molly	147	" I 've been so much with her ; and she may be suffering so , or even dying and I to be dancing ! "
99038	99126	98721	98721	her	189	" Nonsense ! You 're no relation , so you need not feel it so much . I would n't urge you , if she was likely to know about it and be hurt ; but as it is , it 's all fixed that you are to go ; and do n't let us have any nonsense about it . We might sit twirling our thumbs , and repeating hymns all our lives long , if we were to do nothing else when people were dying . "
99127	99133	99135	99135	Molly	147	" I can not go , "
99211	99246	99208	99208	he	675	" I suppose I can have some lunch ? I went away at six this morning , and there 's nothing in the dining - room . I have to go off again directly . "
99262	99270	99272	99272	she	189	" Where are you going , Molly ? "
99276	99285	99319	99320	her father	675	" Only to see about papa 's lunch . "
99286	99305	99319	99320	her father	675	" There are servants to do it ; and I do n't like your going into the kitchen . "
99306	99317	99319	99320	her father	675	" Come , Molly ! sit down and be quiet , "
99322	99448	99319	99320	her father	675	" One comes home wanting peace and quietness and food too . If I am to be appealed to , which I beg I may not be another time , I settle that Molly stops at home this evening . I shall come back late and tired . See that I have something ready to eat , goosey , and then I 'll dress myself up in my best , and go and fetch you home , my dear . I wish all these wedding festivities were well over . Ready , is it ? Then I 'll go into the dining - room and gorge myself . A doctor ought to be able to eat like a camel , or like Major Dugald Dalgetty . "
99911	99923	99900	99900	she	995	" Tell me all Roger says . He will tell you . "
100001	100011	100012	100012	she	147	" I 've been wanting to see you alone , "
100015	100052	100012	100012	she	147	" Your mother does so want some news of your brother Osborne . She told me last week to ask you about him , but I did not like to speak of him before your father . "
100053	100063	100127	100127	He	2905	" She has hardly ever named him to me . "
100064	100126	100012	100012	she	147	" I do n't know why ; for to me she used to talk of him perpetually . I have seen so little of her this week , and I think she forgets a great deal now . Still , if you do n't mind , I should like to be able to tell her something if she asks me again . "
100145	100153	100155	100155	he	2905	" What does she want to know ? "
100160	100172	100155	100155	he	2905	" Does she know that Osborne is coming soon any day ? "
100173	100185	100127	100127	He	2905	" Yes . But she wants to know where he is . "
100186	100211	100155	100155	he	2905	" I ca n't tell you . I do n't exactly know . I believe he 's abroad , but I 'm not sure . "
100212	100223	100127	100127	He	2905	" But you 've sent papa 's letter to him ? "
100224	100299	100155	100155	he	2905	" I 've sent it to a friend of his who will know better than I do where he 's to be found . You must know that he is n't free from creditors , Molly . You ca n't have been one of the family , like a child of the house almost , without knowing that much . For that and for other reasons I do n't exactly know where he is . "
100300	100314	100127	100127	He	2905	" I will tell her so . You are sure he will come ? "
100315	100379	100155	100155	he	2905	" Quite sure . But , Molly , I think my mother may live some time yet ; do n't you ? Dr. Nicholls said so yesterday when he was here with your father . He said she had rallied more than he had ever expected . You 're not afraid of any change that makes you so anxious for Osborne 's coming ? "
100380	100450	100127	100127	He	2905	" No . It 's only for her that I asked . She did seem so to crave for news of him . I think she dreamed of him ; and then when she wakened it was a relief to her to talk about him to me . She always seemed to associate me with him . We used to speak so much of him when we were together . "
100451	100477	100155	100155	he	2905	" I do n't know what we should any of us have done without you . You 've been like a daughter to my mother . "
100478	100485	100487	100487	Molly	147	" I do so love her , "
100491	100568	100155	100155	he	2905	" Yes ; I see . Have you ever noticed that she sometimes calls you ' Fanny ? ' It was the name of a little sister of ours who died . I think she often takes you for her . It was partly that , and partly that at such a time as this one ca n't stand on formalities , that made me call you Molly . I hope you do n't mind it ? "
100569	100595	100155	100155	he	2905	" No ; I like it . But will you tell me something more about your brother ? She really hungers for news of him . "
100596	100667	100155	100155	he	2905	" She 'd better ask me herself . Yet , no ! I am so involved by promises of secrecy , Molly , that I could n't satisfy her if she once began to question me . I believe he 's in Belgium , and that he went there about a fortnight ago , partly to avoid his creditors . You know my father has refused to pay his debts ? "
100668	100680	100155	100155	he	2905	" Yes : at least , I knew something like it . "
100681	100720	100155	100155	he	2905	" I do n't believe my father could raise the money all at once without having recourse to steps which he would exceedingly recoil from . Yet for the time it places Osborne in a very awkward position . "
100721	100742	100155	100155	he	2905	" I think what vexes your father a good deal is some mystery as to how the money was spent . "
100743	100757	100759	100759	Roger	203	" If my mother ever says anything about that part of the affair , "
100763	100801	100759	100759	Roger	203	" assure her from me that there 's nothing of vice or wrong - doing about it . I ca n't say more : I 'm tied . But set her mind at ease on that point . "
100802	100817	100819	100819	Molly	147	" I 'm not sure if she remembers all her painful anxiety about this , "
100821	100893	100819	100819	Molly	147	" She used to speak a great deal to me about him before you came , when your father seemed so angry . And now , whenever she sees me she wants to talk on the old subject ; but she does n't remember so clearly . If she were to see him , I do n't believe she would recollect why she was uneasy about him while he was absent . "
100894	100907	100909	100909	Roger	203	" He must be here soon . I expect him every day , "
100913	100926	100928	100928	Molly	147	" Do you think your father will be very angry with him ? "
100946	100952	100954	100954	Roger	203	" I do n't know , "
100956	101072	100954	100954	Roger	203	" My mother 's illness may alter him ; but he did n't easily forgive us formerly . I remember once but that is nothing to the purpose . I ca n't help fancying that he has put himself under some strong restraint for my mother 's sake , and that he wo n't express much . But it does n't follow that he will forget it . My father is a man of few affections , but what he has are very strong ; he feels anything that touches him on these points deeply and permanently . That unlucky valuing of the property ! It has given my father the idea of post - obits "
101073	101078	101080	101080	Molly	147	" What are they ? "
101082	101109	100954	100954	Roger	203	" Raising money to be paid on my father 's death , which , of course , involves calculations as to the duration of his life . "
101110	101114	101116	101116	she	147	" How shocking ! "
101118	101204	101205	101205	he	2908	" I 'm as sure as I am of my own life that Osborne never did anything of the kind . But my father expressed his suspicions in language that irritated Osborne ; and he does n't speak out , and wo n't justify himself even as much as he might ; and , much as he loves me , I 've but little influence over him , or else he would tell my father all . Well , we must leave it to time , "
101210	101229	101205	101205	he	2908	" My mother would have brought us all right , if she 'd been what she once was . "
101430	101451	101420	101420	she	205	" My dear child , she 's getting past wanting any one ! The keenness of earthly feelings is deadened . "
101452	101529	101420	101420	she	205	" Papa , that is worst of all . I can not bear it . I wo n't believe it . She may not ask for me again , and may quite forget me ; but I 'm sure , to the very last , if the medicines do n't stupefy her , she will look round for the squire and her children . For poor Osborne most of all ; because he 's in sorrow . "
101550	101602	101547	101547	he	238	" I do n't like to take you away while you even fancy you can be of use or comfort to one who has been so kind to you ; but , if she has n't wanted you before Friday , will you be convinced , will you come home willingly ? "
101603	101625	101627	101627	Molly	147	" If I go then , I may see her once again , even if she has n't asked for me ? "
101629	101669	101547	101547	he	238	" Yes , of course . You must make no noise , no step ; but you may go in and see her . I must tell you , I 'm almost certain she wo n't ask for you . "
101670	101694	101547	101547	he	238	" But she may , papa . I will go home on Friday , if she does not . I think she will . "
101882	101911	101852	101852	he	2922	" How is she ? You will tell me you must know the truth ! I 've travelled day and night since I got your father 's letter . "
101935	101941	101943	101943	Molly	147	" She 's very ill , "
101945	101966	101943	101943	Molly	147	" That you know ; but I do n't think she suffers much pain . She has wanted you sadly . "
101971	101979	101967	101967	He	2922	" My father forbade me to come . "
101980	101984	101986	101986	Molly	147	" I know ! "
101996	102022	101986	101986	Molly	147	" Your brother was away , too . I think no one knew how ill she was she had been an invalid for so long . "
102023	102075	101986	101986	Molly	147	" You know Yes ! she told you a great deal she was very fond of you . And God knows how I loved her . If I had not been forbidden to come home , I should have told her all . Does my father know of my coming now ? "
102076	102079	102081	102081	Molly	147	" Yes , "
102083	102093	102081	102081	Molly	147	" I told him papa had sent for you . "
102213	102219	102200	102201	the Squire	1206	" You here , sir ! "
102297	102306	102313	102313	his	2835	" For I think I forget everything now ! "
102320	102354	102313	102313	his	2835	" For the life of me , I ca n't remember whether we 've had dinner or not ; these long nights , and all this sorrow and watching , quite bewilder me . "
102355	102395	102429	102430	the Squire	1206	" Perhaps , sir , you will take some dinner with Mr. Osborne . Mrs. Morgan is sending up his directly . You hardly sate down at dinner - time , sir , you thought my mistress wanted something . "
102396	102427	102313	102313	his	2835	" Ay ! I remember now . No ! I wo n't have any more . Give Mr. Osborne what wine he chooses . Perhaps he can eat and drink . "
102578	102591	102592	102592	he	230	" You 're sure I may n't see her to - night ? "
102603	102671	102592	102592	he	230	" No , indeed . I will go up again if you like it . But Mrs. Jones , the nurse Dr. Nicholls sent , is a very decided person . I went up while you were at dinner , and Mrs. Hamley had just taken her drops , and was on no account to be disturbed by seeing any one , much less by any excitement . "
102693	102728	102885	102885	he	2941	" I wish Roger would come . He seems to be the only one to give me a welcome . Does my father always live upstairs in my mother 's rooms , Miss Gibson ? "
102729	102751	102885	102885	he	2941	" He has done since her last attack . I believe he reproaches himself for not having been enough alarmed before . "
102752	102800	102885	102885	he	2941	" You heard all the words he said to me ; they were not much of a welcome , were they ? And my dear mother , who always whether I was to blame or not I suppose Roger is sure to come home to - night ? "
102801	102805	102885	102885	he	2941	" Quite sure . "
102806	102833	102885	102885	he	2941	" You are staying here , are you not ? Do you often see my mother , or does this omnipotent nurse keep you out too ? "
102834	102868	102885	102885	he	2941	" Mrs. Hamley has n't asked for me for three days now , and I do n't go into her room unless she asks . I 'm leaving on Friday , I believe . "
102869	102881	102885	102885	he	2941	" My mother was very fond of you , I know . "
102903	102917	102885	102885	he	2941	" I suppose do you know whether she is quite conscious quite herself ? "
102918	102923	102925	102925	Molly	147	" Not always conscious , "
102929	102949	102925	102925	Molly	147	" She has to take so many opiates . But she never wanders , only forgets , and sleeps . "
102950	102957	102959	102959	he	2941	" Oh , mother , mother ! "
103987	104007	104008	104008	She	147	" Am I in your way ? I only came here for a minute to look for some books . "
104025	104065	104008	104008	She	147	" Not at all . It is I who am disturbing you . I must just write a letter for the post , and then I shall be gone . Is not this open door too cold for you ? "
104066	104078	104094	104094	he	675	" Oh , no . It is so fresh and pleasant . "
104187	104207	104176	104176	He	203	" Here 's a letter from your wife , Osborne . I went past the post - office and thought "
104218	104232	104208	104208	Osborne	205	" Roger ! what have you done ! Do n't you see her ? "
104284	104314	104279	104279	she	147	" I am so sorry ! I did n't wish to hear it , but I could n't help it . You will trust me , wo n't you ? "
104328	104338	104319	104319	she	147	" Please say you know I shall not tell . "
104339	104346	104348	104348	Osborne	205	" We ca n't help it , "
104352	104373	104348	104348	Osborne	205	" Only Roger , who knew of what importance it was , ought to have looked round him before speaking . "
104374	104379	104381	104381	Roger	203	" So I should , "
104383	104408	104410	104410	he	203	" I 'm more vexed with myself than you can conceive . Not but what I 'm as sure of you as of myself , "
104416	104421	104423	104423	Osborne	205	" Yes ; but , "
104425	104455	104423	104423	Osborne	205	" you see how many chances there are that even the best - meaning persons may let out what it is of such consequence to me to keep secret . "
104456	104464	104466	104466	Roger	203	" I know you think it so , "
104468	104489	104423	104423	Osborne	205	" Well , do n't let us begin that old discussion again at any rate , before a third person . "
104523	104555	104521	104521	she	147	" I 'm going away . Perhaps I ought not to have been here . I 'm very sorry very . But I 'll try and forget what I 've heard . "
104556	104563	104565	104565	Osborne	205	" You ca n't do that , "
104570	104634	104565	104565	Osborne	205	" But will you promise me never to speak about it to any one not even to me , or to Roger ? Will you try to act and speak as if you had never heard it ? I 'm sure , from what Roger has told me about you , that if you give me this promise I may rely upon it . "
104635	104642	104644	104644	Molly	147	" Yes ; I will promise , "
104672	104713	104669	104669	She	147	" I think I should have done so , even without a promise . But it is , perhaps , better to bind oneself . I will go away now . I wish I 'd never come into this room . "
105027	105038	105007	105007	she	205	" The drawing - room must be refurnished when Osborne marries "
105040	105087	105007	105007	she	205	" Osborne 's wife will like to have the west suite of rooms to herself ; it will perhaps be a trial to her to live with the old couple ; but we must arrange it so that she will feel it as little as possible . "
105088	105115	105007	105007	she	205	" Of course , when Mrs. Osborne comes we must try and give her a new carriage ; the old one does well enough for us . "
105508	105510	105512	105512	he	203	" married "
105892	105898	105899	105899	she	147	" Is any one coming ? "
105905	105920	105899	105899	she	147	" Missus 's daughter from France . Miss Kirkpatrick is coming to - morrow . "
106075	106226	106064	106064	she	189	" Oh , yes ! Cynthia is coming home to - morrow , by the ' Umpire , ' which passes through at ten o'clock . What an oppressive day it is for the time of the year ! I really am almost ready to faint . Cynthia heard of some opportunity , I believe , and was only too glad to leave school a fortnight earlier than we planned . She never gave me the chance of writing to say I did , or did not , like her coming so much before the time ; and I shall have to pay for her just the same as if she had stopped . And I meant to have asked her to bring me a French bonnet ; and then you could have had one made after mine . But I 'm very glad she 's coming , poor dear . "
106227	106235	106237	106237	Molly	147	" Is anything the matter with her ? "
106239	106249	106064	106064	she	189	" Oh , no ! Why should there be ? "
106250	106270	106064	106064	she	189	" You called her ' poor dear , ' and it made me afraid lest she might be ill . "
106271	106356	106064	106064	she	189	" Oh , no ! It 's only a way I got into , when Mr. Kirkpatrick died . A fatherless girl you know one always does call them ' poor dears . ' Oh , no ! Cynthia never is ill . She 's as strong as a horse . She never would have felt to - day as I have done . Could you get me a glass of wine and a biscuit , my dear ? I 'm really quite faint . "
106432	106455	106382	106382	Molly	147	" Well , I suppose young ladies like their bedrooms decked out in this way ! It 's very pretty certainly , but "
106456	106477	106531	106531	Molly	147	" I liked my own old room better , papa ; but perhaps Cynthia is accustomed to such decking up . "
106478	106530	106382	106382	Molly	147	" Perhaps ; at any rate , she 'll see we 've tried to make it pretty . Yours is like hers . That 's right . It might have hurt her , if hers had been smarter than yours . Now , good - night in your fine flimsy bed . "
106580	106584	106609	106610	Mrs. Gibson	189	" George Inn , "
106587	106589	106609	106610	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Umpire "
106642	106660	106627	106627	she	147	" Where are you going so early , child ? The fog has n't cleared away yet . "
106661	106679	106627	106627	she	147	" I thought you would go and meet Cynthia ; and I wanted to go with you . "
106680	106717	106627	106627	she	147	" She will be here in half an hour ; and dear papa has told the gardener to take the wheelbarrow down for her luggage . I 'm not sure if he is not gone himself . "
106718	106725	106727	106727	Molly	147	" Then are not you going ? "
106736	106791	106627	106627	she	147	" No , certainly not . She will be here almost directly . And , besides , I do n't like to expose my feelings to every passer - by in High Street . You forget I have not seen her for two years , and I hate scenes in the market - place . "
106831	106839	106840	106840	she	147	" Here she is here she is ! "
106896	106922	106871	106871	Molly	147	" Well ! here she is . Molly , this is Cynthia . Cynthia , Molly . You 're to be sisters , you know . "
107000	107005	107006	107006	she	252	" Here 's mamma , "
107058	107074	107055	107056	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Why , how you are grown , darling ! You look quite a woman . "
107075	107081	107083	107083	Cynthia	252	" And so I am , "
107085	107111	107083	107083	Cynthia	252	" I was before I went away ; I 've hardly grown since , except , it is always to be hoped , in wisdom . "
107112	107120	107122	107123	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ! That we will hope , "
107352	107373	107375	107376	Mr. Gibson	238	" There 's hot breakfast ready for you in the dining - room , when you are ready for it , "
107378	107391	107392	107392	He	238	" I 'm sure you must want it after your night journey . "
107417	107428	107430	107430	she	3071	" Molly will take you to your room , darling , "
107432	107476	107430	107430	she	3071	" it is near hers , and she has got her things to take off . I 'll come down and sit in the dining - room while you are having your breakfast , but I really am afraid of the cold now . "
107484	107497	107499	107499	Molly	147	" I 'm so sorry there is n't a fire for you , "
107501	107530	107499	107499	Molly	147	" but I suppose it was n't ordered ; and , of course , I do n't give any orders . Here is some hot water , though . "
107531	107536	107538	107538	Cynthia	252	" Stop a minute , "
107568	107611	107561	107561	she	147	" I think I shall like you . I am so glad ! I was afraid I should not . We 're all in a very awkward position together , are n't we ? I like your father 's looks , though . "
107639	107701	107633	107633	Cynthia	252	" Ah , you may laugh . But I do n't know that I am easy to get on with ; mamma and I did n't suit when we were last together . But perhaps we are each of us wiser now . Now , please leave me for a quarter of an hour . I do n't want anything more . "
108071	108079	108084	108084	Molly	147	" being all things to all men . "
108787	108798	108800	108801	her father	675	" They all sent their love to you , Molly , "
108803	108814	108800	108801	her father	675	" Roger said he knew how you would feel it . "
108958	108970	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" You loved her dearly , did you not , Molly ? "
108971	108974	108976	108976	Molly	147	" Yes , "
108985	108992	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" Had you known her long ? "
108993	109042	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" No , not a year . But I had seen a great deal of her . I was almost like a daughter to her ; she said so . Yet I never bid her good - by , or anything . Her mind became weak and confused . "
109043	109052	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" She had only sons , I think ? "
109053	109088	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" No ; only Mr. Osborne and Mr. Roger Hamley . She had a daughter once ' Fanny . ' Sometimes , in her illness , she used to call me ' Fanny . ' "
109108	109121	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" I wish I could love people as you do , Molly ! "
109122	109127	109129	109130	the other	776	" Do n't you ? "
109135	109192	109104	109104	Cynthia	252	" No . A good number of people love me , I believe , or at least they think they do ; but I never seem to care much for any one . I do believe I love you , little Molly , whom I have only known for ten days , better than any one . "
109193	109199	109201	109201	Molly	147	" Not than your mother ? "
109207	109214	109216	109216	Cynthia	252	" Yes , than my mother ! "
109222	109279	109280	109280	she	252	" It 's very shocking , I daresay ; but it is so . Now , do n't go and condemn me . I do n't think love for one 's mother quite comes by nature ; and remember how much I have been separated from mine ! I loved my father , if you will , "
109297	109503	109294	109294	she	252	" but he died when I was quite a little thing , and no one believes that I remember him . I heard mamma say to a caller , not a fortnight after his funeral , ' Oh , no , Cynthia is too young ; she has quite forgotten him ' and I bit my lips , to keep from crying out , ' Papa ! papa ! have I ? ' But it 's of no use . Well , then mamma had to go out as a governess ; she could n't help it , poor thing ! but she did n't much care for parting with me . I was a trouble , I daresay . So I was sent to school at four years old ; first one school , and then another ; and in the holidays , mamma went to stay at grand houses , and I was generally left with the schoolmistresses . Once I went to the Towers ; and mamma lectured me continually , and yet I was very naughty , I believe . And so I never went again ; and I was very glad of it , for it was a horrid place . "
109504	109509	109511	109511	Molly	147	" That it was ! "
109522	109592	109294	109294	she	252	" And once I went to London , to stay with my uncle Kirkpatrick . He is a lawyer , and getting on now ; but then he was poor enough , and had six or seven children . It was winter - time , and we were all shut up in a small house in Doughty Street . But , after all , that was n't so bad . "
109593	109625	109294	109294	she	252	" But then you lived with your mother when she began school at Ashcombe . Mr. Preston told me that , when I stayed that day at the Manor - house . "
109626	109633	109635	109635	Cynthia	247	" What did he tell you ? "
109640	109665	109294	109294	she	252	" Nothing but that . Oh , yes ! He praised your beauty , and wanted me to tell you what he had said . "
109666	109676	109678	109678	Cynthia	247	" I should have hated you if you had , "
109680	109692	109694	109694	Molly	147	" Of course I never thought of doing such a thing , "
109696	109724	109694	109694	Molly	147	" I did n't like him ; and Lady Harriet spoke of him the next day , as if he was n't a person to be liked . "
109735	109742	109732	109732	she	3125	" I wish I was good ! "
109743	109748	109750	109750	Molly	147	" So do I , "
109777	109779	109766	109768	the just Smell	309	" goodness "
109795	109870	109732	109732	she	3125	" Nonsense , Molly ! You are good . At least , if you 're not good , what am I ? There 's a rule - of - three sum for you to do ! But it 's no use talking ; I am not good , and I never shall be now . Perhaps I might be a heroine still , but I shall never be a good woman , I know . "
109871	109882	109759	109760	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Do you think it easier to be a heroine ? "
109883	109929	109732	109732	she	3125	" Yes , as far as one knows of heroines from history . I 'm capable of a great jerk , an effort , and then a relaxation but steady , every - day goodness is beyond me . I must be a moral kangaroo ! "
109954	110023	109759	109760	Mrs. Hamley	205	" How I should like to see them all ! and yet one can do nothing at such a time ! Papa says the funeral is to be on Tuesday , and that , after that , Roger Hamley is to go back to Cambridge . It will seem as if nothing had happened ! I wonder how the squire and Mr. Osborne Hamley will get on together . "
110024	110047	110144	110144	she	3129	" He 's the eldest son , is he not ? Why should n't he and his father get on well together ? "
110048	110074	109759	109760	Mrs. Hamley	205	" Oh ! I do n't know . That is to say , I do know , but I think I ought not to tell . "
110075	110139	110144	110144	she	3129	" Do n't be so pedantically truthful , Molly . Besides , your manner shows when you speak truth and when you speak falsehood , without troubling yourself to use words . I knew exactly what your ' I do n't know ' meant . I never consider myself bound to be truthful , so I beg we may be on equal terms . "
110319	110327	110329	110329	she	3129	" Now for you , sweet one , "
110340	110356	110329	110329	she	3129	" I 've been working as connoisseur until now ; now I begin as amateur . "
110618	110769	110800	110801	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ! The Squire is a good deal changed ; but he 's better than he was . There 's an unspoken estrangement between him and Osborne ; one can see it in the silence and constraint of their manners ; but outwardly they are friendly civil at any rate . The squire will always respect Osborne as his heir , and the future representative of the family . Osborne does n't look well ; he says he wants change . I think he 's weary of the domestic dullness , or domestic dissension . But he feels his mother 's death acutely . It 's a wonder that he and his father are not drawn together by their common loss . Roger 's away at Cambridge too examination for the mathematical tripos . Altogether the aspect of both people and place is changed ; it is but natural ! "
110818	110866	110800	110801	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear ! why do n't you ask him to dinner here ? A little quiet dinner , you know . Cook is quite up to it ; and we would all of us wear blacks and lilacs ; he could n't consider that as gaiety . "
111156	111253	111150	111150	Cynthia	247	" I 'm not good , and I told you so . Somehow , I can not forgive her for her neglect of me as a child , when I would have clung to her . Besides , I hardly ever heard from her when I was at school . And I know she put a stop to my coming over to her wedding . I saw the letter she wrote to Madame Lefevre . A child should be brought up with its parents , if it is to think them infallible when it grows up . "
111254	111266	111268	111268	Molly	147	" But though it may know that there must be faults , "
111270	111284	111268	111268	Molly	147	" it ought to cover them over and try to forget their existence . "
111285	111324	111332	111332	VISITORS	625	" It ought . But do n't you see I have grown up outside the pale of duty and ' oughts . ' Love me as I am , sweet one , for I shall never be better . "
111619	111649	111993	111993	She	147	" It is the first time I have been in Hollingford since your marriage , Mrs. Gibson , or I should certainly have called to pay my respects sooner . "
111650	111688	111993	111993	She	147	" I know you are very busy at Ashcombe . I did not expect you to call . Is Lord Cumnor at the Towers ? I have not heard from her ladyship for more than a week ! "
111689	111725	111993	111993	She	147	" No ! he seemed still detained at Bath . But I had a letter from him giving me certain messages for Mr. Sheepshanks . Mr. Gibson is not at home , I 'm afraid ? "
111726	111768	111993	111993	She	147	" No . He is a great deal out almost constantly , I may say . I had no idea that I should see so little of him . A doctor 's wife leads a very solitary life , Mr. Preston ! "
111769	111794	111796	111796	he	3160	" You can hardly call it solitary , I should think , when you have such a companion as Miss Gibson always at hand , "
111802	111865	111993	111993	She	147	" Oh , but I call it solitude for a wife when her husband is away . Poor Mr. Kirkpatrick was never happy unless I always went with him ; all his walks , all his visits , he liked me to be with him . But , somehow , Mr. Gibson feels as if I should be rather in his way . "
111866	111883	111885	111885	Molly	147	" I do n't think you could ride pillion behind him on Black Bess , mamma , "
111887	111912	111885	111885	Molly	147	" And unless you could do that , you could hardly go with him in his rounds up and down all the rough lanes . "
111913	111992	112019	112019	he	247	" Oh ! but he might keep a brougham ! I 've often said so . And then I could use it for visiting in the evenings . Really it was one reason why I did n't go to the Hollingford Charity Ball . I could n't bring myself to use the dirty fly from the ' George . ' We really must stir papa up against next winter , Molly ; it will never do for you and "
112039	112053	112031	112031	He	247	" Have you ever been to a public ball yet , Miss Gibson ? "
112054	112057	112059	112059	Molly	147	" No ! "
112061	112075	112031	112031	He	247	" It will be a great pleasure to you when the time comes . "
112076	112104	112031	112031	He	247	" I 'm not sure . I shall like it if I have plenty of partners ; but I 'm afraid I sha n't know many people . "
112105	112126	112031	112031	He	247	" And you suppose that young men have n't their own ways and means of being introduced to pretty girls ? "
112191	112229	112176	112176	she	147	" I only hope I may be one of your partners at the first ball you go to . Pray , remember my early application for that honour , when you are overwhelmed with requests for dances . "
112230	112240	112242	112242	Molly	147	" I do n't choose to engage myself beforehand , "
112271	112289	112290	112290	he	247	" Young ladies are always very cautious in fact , however modest they may be in profession , "
112303	112337	112294	112294	himself	247	" In spite of Miss Gibson 's apprehension of not having many partners , she declines the certainty of having one . I suppose Miss Kirkpatrick will have returned from France before then ? "
112420	112447	112411	112412	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ; certainly . My daughter will be with us next winter , I believe ; and I daresay she will go out with us . "
112448	112462	112466	112466	herself	147	" Why ca n't she say at once that Cynthia is here now ? "
112496	112507	112493	112493	he	247	" You have good news from her , I hope ? "
112508	112549	112485	112485	he	247	" Yes ; very . By the way , how are our old friends the Robinsons ? How often I think of their kindness to me at Ashcombe ! Dear good people , I wish I could see them again . "
112550	112569	112493	112493	he	247	" I will certainly tell them of your kind inquiries . They are very well , I believe . "
112842	112848	112850	112850	she	698	" Look at my purchases , "
112852	112868	112850	112850	she	698	" This green ribbon was fourteen - pence a yard , this silk three shillings , "
113113	113216	113104	113104	her	147	" Poor Mrs. Hamley could hardly do without Molly ; she quite looked upon her as a daughter , especially towards the last , when , I am afraid , she had a good deal of anxiety . Mr. Osborne Hamley I daresay you have heard he did not do so well at college , and they had expected so much parents will , you know ; but what did it signify ? for he had not to earn his living ! I call it a very foolish kind of ambition when a young man has not to go into a profession . "
113217	113258	113314	113314	Cynthia	247	" Well , at any rate , the Squire must be satisfied now . I saw this morning 's Times , with the Cambridge examination lists in it . Is n't the second son called after his father , Roger ? "
113259	113262	113264	113264	Molly	147	" Yes , "
113273	113283	113291	113291	he	247	" He 's senior wrangler , that 's all , "
113316	113321	113323	113323	she	147	" Poor Mrs. Hamley , "
113456	113670	113442	113442	he	247	" The poor old Squire not the wisest of men has woefully mismanaged his estate . And Osborne Hamley is too fine a gentleman to understand the means by which to improve the value of the land even if he had the capital . A man who had practical knowledge of agriculture , and some thousands of ready money , might bring the rental up to eight thousand or so . Of course , Osborne will try and marry some one with money ; the family is old and well - established , and he must n't object to commercial descent , though I daresay the Squire will for him ; but then the young fellow himself is not the man for the work . No ! the family 's going down fast ; and it 's a pity when these old Saxon houses vanish off the land ; but it is ' kismet ' with the Hamleys . Even the senior wrangler if it is that Roger Hamley he will have spent all his brains in one effort . You never hear of a senior wrangler being worth anything afterwards . He 'll be a Fellow of his college , of course that will be a livelihood for him at any rate . "
113671	113678	113680	113680	Cynthia	247	" I believe in senior wranglers , "
113691	113739	113682	113682	her	3175	" And from all I 've ever heard of Mr. Roger Hamley , I believe he will keep up the distinction he has earned . And I do n't believe that the house of Hamley is so near extinction in wealth and fame , and good name . "
113740	113752	113754	113755	Mr. Preston	247	" They are fortunate in having Miss Kirkpatrick 's good word , "
113763	113767	113769	113769	Cynthia	247	" Dear Molly , "
113775	113839	113769	113769	Cynthia	247	" I know nothing about your friends the Hamleys , except that they are your friends , and what you have told me about them . But I wo n't have that man speaking of them so and your eyes filling with tears all the time . I 'd sooner swear to their having all the talents and good fortune under the sun . "
113971	113986	113967	113967	she	3178	" You are wise , and I am foolish have mercy on my folly . "
114034	114086	114027	114027	he	313	" Eh , miss , but that be a rare young lady ! She do have such pretty coaxing ways . I be to teach her to bud roses come the season and I 'll warrant ye she 'll learn sharp enough , for all she says she bees so stupid . "
114769	114803	114804	114804	she	189	" Well , really , I begin to have some faith in long descent . What a gentleman he is ! How agreeable and polite ! So different from that forward Mr. Preston , "
114830	114858	114814	114814	Cynthia	247	" Mr. Preston does n't improve on acquaintance . There was a time , mamma , when I think both you and I thought him very agreeable . "
114859	114919	114804	114804	she	189	" I do n't remember . You 've a clearer memory than I have . But we were talking of this delightful Mr. Osborne Hamley . Why , Molly , you were always talking of his brother it was Roger this , and Roger that I ca n't think how it was you so seldom mentioned this young man . "
114920	114934	114936	114936	Molly	147	" I did n't know I had mentioned Mr. Roger Hamley so often , "
114942	114956	114936	114936	Molly	147	" But I saw much more of him he was more at home . "
114957	115032	114804	114804	she	189	" Well , well ! It 's all right , my dear . I daresay he suits you best . But really , when I saw Osborne Hamley close to my Cynthia , I could n't help thinking but perhaps I 'd better not tell you what I was thinking of . Only they are each of them so much above the average in appearance ; and , of course , that suggests things . "
115033	115045	115047	115047	Cynthia	247	" I perfectly understand what you were thinking of , mamma , "
115054	115065	115047	115047	Cynthia	247	" and so does Molly , I have no doubt . "
115066	115228	114804	114804	she	189	" Well ! there 's no harm in it , I 'm sure . Did you hear him say that , though he did not like to leave his father alone just at present , yet that when his brother Roger came back from Cambridge , he should feel more at liberty ! It was quite as much as to say , ' If you will ask me to dinner then , I shall be delighted to come . ' And chickens will be so much cheaper , and cook has such a nice way of boning them , and doing them up with forcemeat . Everything seems to be falling out so fortunately . And Molly , my dear , you know I wo n't forget you . By - and - by , when Roger Hamley has taken his turn at stopping at home with his father , we will ask him to one of our little quiet dinners . "
115280	115319	115341	115341	she	147	" I 'm afraid Molly is n't properly grateful , mamma . If I were you , I would n't exert myself to give a dinner - party on her account . Bestow all your kindness upon me . "
115366	115420	115351	115351	she	147	" Mr. Roger Hamley has been very good to me ; he was a great deal at home when I was there , and Mr. Osborne Hamley was very little there : that was the reason I spoke so much more of one than the other . If I had if he had , "
115431	115459	115422	115422	her	147	" I do n't think I should , oh , Cynthia , instead of laughing at me , I think you might help me to explain myself ! "
115470	115501	115422	115422	her	147	" Mamma 's paragon gives me an idea of weakness . I ca n't quite make out whether it 's in body or mind . Which is it , Molly ? "
115502	115549	115422	115422	her	147	" He is not strong , I know ; but he 's very accomplished and clever . Every one says that , even papa , who does n't generally praise young men . That made the puzzle the greater when he did so badly at college . "
115550	115586	115422	115422	her	147	" Then it 's his character that is weak . I 'm sure there 's weakness somewhere ; but he 's very agreeable . It must have been very pleasant , staying at the Hall . "
115587	115597	115422	115422	her	147	" Yes ; but it 's all over now . "
115598	115603	115605	115606	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , nonsense ! "
115618	115704	115605	115606	Mrs. Gibson	189	" We shall have the young men coming to dinner pretty often , you 'll see . Your father likes them , and I shall always make a point of welcoming his friends . They ca n't go on mourning for a mother for ever . I expect we shall see a great deal of them ; and that the two families will become very intimate . After all , these good Hollingford people are terribly behindhand , and I should say , rather commonplace . "
115903	115933	115895	115895	he	230	" Ah , that would be the day I was crossing ! It was stormy indeed ! Instead of our being only two hours , we were nearly five . "
115936	115950	115895	115895	he	230	" I met Lord Hollingford at Dover last week , and he said , "
115952	115973	115895	115895	he	230	" The cold now is nothing to what it was in London on Thursday the thermometer was down at 15į . "
116178	116186	116175	116175	he	230	" the happy days that are gone , "
116189	116199	116175	116175	he	230	" to the time when my mother was alive ; "
116811	116816	116817	116817	he	203	" Ah , Roger ! "
116840	116871	116822	116822	Molly	147	" He is a fellow in a thousand in a thousand , indeed ! I do n't believe there is his match anywhere for goodness and real solid power combined . "
116872	116875	116877	116877	Cynthia	247	" Molly , "
116886	116933	116877	116877	Cynthia	247	" what sort of a man is this Roger Hamley ? One ca n't tell how much to believe of his brother 's praises ; for it is the one subject on which Osborne Hamley becomes enthusiastic . I 've noticed it once or twice before . "
116954	117067	116949	116950	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It just shows what a sweet disposition Osborne Hamley is of that he should praise his brother as he does . I daresay he is a senior wrangler , and much good may it do him ! I do n't deny that ; but as for conversation , he 's as heavy as heavy can be . A great awkward fellow to boot , who looks as if he did not know two and two made four , for all he is such a mathematical genius . You would hardly believe he was Osborne Hamley 's brother to see him ! I should not think he has a profile at all . "
117068	117078	117082	117082	Cynthia	247	" What do you think of him , Molly ? "
117084	117089	117091	117091	Molly	147	" I like him , "
117093	117111	117091	117091	Molly	147	" He has been very kind to me . I know he is n't handsome like Osborne . "
117149	117159	117161	117161	Cynthia	247	" I suppose he will come home at Easter , "
117163	117173	117161	117161	Cynthia	247	" and then I shall see him for myself . "
117174	117195	117197	117198	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It 's a great pity that their being in mourning will prevent their going to the Easter charity ball , "
117202	117302	117197	117198	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I sha n't like to take you two girls , if you are not to have any partners . It will put me in such an awkward position . I wish we could join on to the Towers party . That would secure you partners , for they always bring a number of dancing men , who might dance with you after they had done their duty by the ladies of the house . But really everything is so changed since dear Lady Cumnor has been an invalid that , perhaps , they wo n't go at all . "
117428	117431	117425	117425	she	189	" bring out "
117453	117460	117462	117462	her	189	" They are not out yet , "
117498	117502	117491	117491	She	189	" not being out "
117570	117605	117547	117548	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" You are very kind , Miss Browning , but , you see , I hardly like to let them go they are not out , you know , till after the Easter ball . "
117606	117613	117615	117615	Cynthia	247	" Till when we are invisible , "
117631	117657	117615	117615	Cynthia	247	" We are so high in rank that our sovereign must give us her sanction before we can play a round game at your house . "
117699	117880	117979	117980	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't understand it at all . In my days girls went wherever it pleased people to ask them , without this farce of bursting out in all their new fine clothes at some public place . I do n't mean but what the gentry took their daughters to York , or Matlock , or Bath , to give them a taste of gay society when they were growing up ; and the quality went up to London , and their young ladies were presented to Queen Charlotte , and went to a birthday ball , perhaps . But for us little Hollingford people why , we knew every child amongst us from the day of its birth ; and many a girl of twelve or fourteen have I seen go out to a card - party , and sit quiet at her work , and know how to behave as well as any lady there . There was no talk of ' coming out ' in those days for any one under the daughter of a Squire . "
117881	117903	117905	117905	Cynthia	247	" After Easter , Molly and I shall know how to behave at a card - party , but not before , "
117909	117924	117926	117927	Miss Browning	159	" You 're always fond of your quips and your cranks , my dear , "
117929	117978	117926	117927	Miss Browning	159	" and I would n't quite answer for your behaviour : you sometimes let your spirits carry you away . But I 'm quite sure Molly will be a little lady as she always is , and always was , and I have known her from a babe . "
118004	118053	117995	117995	she	189	" I do n't think you would have called Molly a lady the other day , Miss Browning , if you had found her where I did : sitting up in a cherry - tree , six feet from the ground at least , I do assure you . "
118054	118063	118069	118069	her	159	" Oh ! but that was n't pretty , "
118074	118087	118069	118069	her	159	" I thought you 'd left off those tom - boy ways . "
118088	118101	118103	118104	Mrs. Gibson	189	" She wants the refinement which good society gives in several ways , "
118114	118128	118103	118104	Mrs. Gibson	189	" She 's very apt to come upstairs two steps at a time . "
118129	118135	118137	118137	Cynthia	247	" Only two , Molly ! "
118139	118157	118137	118137	Cynthia	247	" Why , to - day I found I could manage four of these broad shallow steps . "
118158	118168	118103	118104	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear child , what are you saying ? "
118169	118257	118137	118137	Cynthia	247	" Only confessing that I , like Molly , want the refinements which good society gives ; therefore , please do let us go to Miss Brownings ' this evening . I will pledge myself for Molly that she sha n't sit in a cherry - tree ; and Molly shall see that I do n't go upstairs in an unladylike way . I will go upstairs as meekly as if I were a come - out young lady , and had been to the Easter ball . "
118325	118332	118334	118336	Miss Phobe Browning	159	" And see , my dears , "
118356	118454	118345	118345	Roger	203	" we 've got a gentleman for you after all ! Was n't it fortunate ? just as sister said that you might find it dull you , Cynthia , she meant , because you know you come from France then , just as if he had been sent from heaven , Mr. Roger came in to call ; and I wo n't say we laid violent hands on him , because he was too good for that ; but really we should have been near it , if he had not stayed of his own accord . "
118490	118500	118501	118501	he	203	" I want to know her your new sister , "
119057	119089	119040	119040	she	147	" At my uncle 's , we always give a silver threepence for three dozen . You know what a silver threepence is , do n't you , dear Miss Gibson ? "
119090	119113	119040	119040	she	147	" The three classes are published in the Senate House at nine o'clock on the Friday morning , and you ca n't imagine "
119114	119133	119040	119040	she	147	" I think it will be thought rather shabby to play at anything less than sixpence . That gentleman "
119138	119166	119040	119040	she	147	" is at Cambridge , and you know they always play very high there , and sometimes ruin themselves , do n't they , dear Miss Gibson ? "
119167	119213	119040	119040	she	147	" Oh , on this occasion the Master of Arts who precedes the candidates for honours when they go into the Senate House is called the Father of the College to which he belongs . I think I mentioned that before , did n't I ? "
119472	119498	119499	119499	Cynthia	247	" Rounds are sixes , and three dozen counters cost sixpence . Pay up , if you please , and let us begin at once . "
119524	119527	119529	119529	he	3278	" Willie , "
119609	119655	119607	119607	One	6670	" That , after all , a senior wrangler was no great shakes . Any man might be one if he liked , but there were a lot of fellows that he knew who would be very sorry to go in for anything so slow . "
119865	119883	119885	119885	he	3288	" I am so glad to see you again it seems such a long time since Christmas , "
119906	119913	119914	119914	she	147	" It is a long time , "
119917	119999	119914	119914	she	147	" we are close to Easter now . I have so wanted to tell you how glad I was to hear about your honours at Cambridge . I once thought of sending you a message through your brother , but then I thought it might be making too much fuss , because I know nothing of mathematics , or of the value of a senior wranglership ; and you were sure to have so many congratulations from people who did know . "
120000	120008	120010	120010	he	3290	" I missed yours though , Molly , "
120014	120025	120010	120010	he	3290	" But I felt sure you were glad for me . "
120026	120032	120034	120034	she	3291	" Glad and proud too , "
120036	120053	120034	120034	she	3291	" I should so like to hear something more about it . I heard you telling Cynthia "
120054	120077	120010	120010	he	3290	" Yes . What a charming person she is ! I should think you must be happier than we expected long ago . "
120078	120090	120092	120092	Molly	147	" But tell me something about the senior wranglership , please , "
120094	120131	120010	120010	he	3290	" It 's a long story , and I ought to be helping the Miss Brownings to hand sandwiches besides , you would n't find it very interesting , it 's so full of technical details . "
120132	120139	120141	120141	Molly	147	" Cynthia looked very much interested , "
120143	120198	120010	120010	he	3290	" Well ! then I refer you to her , for I must go now . I ca n't for shame go on sitting here , and letting those good ladies have all the trouble . But I shall come and call on Mrs. Gibson soon . Are you walking home to - night ? "
120199	120206	120208	120208	Molly	147	" Yes , I think so , "
120217	120268	120010	120010	he	3290	" Then I shall walk home with you . I left my horse at the ' George , ' and that 's half - way . I suppose old Betty will allow me to accompany you and your sister ? You used to describe her as something of a dragon . "
120269	120275	120277	120277	Molly	147	" Betty has left us , "
120281	120293	120277	120277	Molly	147	" She 's gone to live at a place at Ashcombe . "
120616	120631	120633	120633	she	3302	" Oh ! it was n't very entertaining . One did n't expect that , "
120637	120642	120644	120645	Mr. Gibson	238	" Who were there ? "
120647	120656	120644	120645	Mr. Gibson	238	" Quite a young party was n't it ? "
120657	120695	120633	120633	she	3302	" They 'd only asked Lizzie and Fanny Orford , and their brother ; but Mr. Roger Hamley had ridden over and called on Miss Brownings , and they kept him to tea . No one else . "
120696	120701	120703	120704	Mr. Gibson	238	" Roger Hamley there ! "
120706	120724	120703	120704	Mr. Gibson	238	" He 's come home then . I must make time to ride over and see him . "
120725	120734	120736	120737	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You 'd much better ask him here , "
120739	120767	120736	120737	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Suppose you invite him and his brother to dine here on Friday , my dear . It would be a very pretty attention , I think . "
120768	120800	120633	120633	she	3302	" My dear ! these young Cambridge men have a very good taste in wine , and do n't spare it . My cellar wo n't stand many of their attacks . "
120801	120814	120736	120737	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I did n't think you were so inhospitable , Mr. Gibson . "
120815	120893	120633	120633	she	3302	" I 'm not inhospitable , I 'm sure . If you 'll put ' bitter beer ' in the corner of your notes of invitation , just as the smart people put ' quadrilles ' as a sign of the entertainment offered , we 'll have Osborne and Roger to dinner any day you like . And what did you think of my favourite , Cynthia ? You had n't seen him before , I think ? "
120894	120945	121005	121005	she	189	" Oh ! he 's nothing like so handsome as his brother ; nor so polished ; nor so easy to talk to . He entertained me for more than an hour with a long account of some examination or other ; but there 's something one likes about him . "
120946	120951	120953	120954	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Well and Molly , "
120979	120989	120977	120977	Cynthia	247	" what sort of an evening have you had ? "
120990	120997	120998	120998	Her	189	" Very pleasant , thank you . "
121046	121056	121058	121059	Mr. Gibson	238	" We 've had our unexpected visitor , too , "
121061	121179	121058	121059	Mr. Gibson	238	" Just after dinner , who should come in but Mr. Preston . I fancy he 's having more of the management of the Hollingford property than formerly . Sheepshanks is getting an old man . And if so , I suspect we shall see a good deal of Preston . He 's ' no blate , ' as they used to say in Scotland , and made himself quite at home to - night . If I 'd asked him to stay , or , indeed , if I 'd done anything but yawn , he 'd have been here now . But I defy any man to stay when I 've a fit of yawning . "
121180	121189	121191	121191	Molly	147	" Do you like Mr. Preston , papa ? "
121193	121244	121347	121348	Mrs. Gibson	189	" About as much as I do half the men I meet . He talks well , and has seen a good deal . I know very little of him , though , except that he 's my lord 's steward , which is a guarantee for a good deal . "
121245	121265	121347	121348	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Lady Harriet spoke pretty strongly against him that day I was with her at the Manor - house . "
121266	121289	121291	121292	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Lady Harriet 's always full of fancies : she likes persons to - day , and dislikes them to - morrow , "
121320	121346	121347	121348	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You must know a good deal about Mr. Preston , my dear . I suppose you saw a good deal of him at Ashcombe ? "
121379	121427	121347	121348	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ; we saw a good deal of him at one time , I mean . He 's changeable , I think . But he always sent us game , and sometimes fruit . There were some stories against him , but I never believed them . "
121428	121434	121436	121437	Mr. Gibson	238	" What kind of stories ? "
121441	121510	121347	121348	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , vague stories , you know : scandal , I daresay . No one ever believed them . He could be so agreeable if he chose ; and my lord , who is so very particular , would never have kept him as agent if they were true ; not that I ever knew what they were , for I consider all scandal as abominable gossip . "
121511	121522	121524	121525	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 'm very glad I yawned in his face , "
121527	121536	121524	121525	Mr. Gibson	238	" I hope he 'll take the hint . "
121537	121559	121561	121561	Molly	147	" If it was one of your giant - gapes , papa , I should call it more than a hint , "
121563	121588	121561	121561	Molly	147	" And if you want a yawning chorus the next time he comes , I 'll join in ; wo n't you , Cynthia ? "
121589	121595	121597	121598	the latter	1251	" I do n't know , "
121767	121777	121779	121779	she	147	" You can finish it now , I think , "
121781	121808	121779	121779	she	147	" You know about the bright - coloured flowers being against the privet - hedge , and where the new rose - bed is to be ? "
121809	121819	121821	121821	he	313	" I ca n't justly say as I do , "
121823	121879	121821	121821	he	313	" Mebbe , you 'll just go o'er it all once again , Miss Molly . I 'm not so young as I oncst was , and my head is not so clear now - a - days , and I 'd be loath to make mistakes when you 're so set upon your plans . "
121938	121962	121934	121934	he	3310	" I see , miss . All right , Miss Molly , I'se gotten it in my head as clear as patchwork now . "
122035	122076	122027	122028	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I only just found out where you were , Molly . Mrs. Gibson said you had gone out , but she did n't know where ; and it was the greatest chance that I turned round and saw you . "
122077	122120	122523	122523	he	3312	" I saw you some time ago , but I could n't leave Williams . I think he was unusually slow to - day ; and he seemed as if he could n't understand my plans for the new flower - beds . "
122121	122190	122027	122028	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Is that the paper you 've got in your hand ? Let me look at it , will you ? Ah , I see ! you 've borrowed some of your ideas from our garden at home , have n't you ? This bed of scarlet geraniums , with the border of young oaks , pegged down ! That was a fancy of my dear mother 's . "
122205	122218	122202	122202	Molly	147	" How is the Squire ? I 've never seen him since . "
122219	122328	122523	122523	he	3312	" No , he told me how much he wanted to see you , but he could n't make up his mind to come and call . I suppose it would never do now for you to come and stay at the Hall , would it ? It would give my father so much pleasure : he looks upon you as a daughter , and I 'm sure both Osborne and I shall always consider you are like a sister to us , after all my mother 's love for you , and your tender care of her at last . But I suppose it would n't do . "
122329	122335	122337	122337	Molly	147	" No ! certainly not , "
122341	122506	122523	122523	he	3312	" I fancy if you could come it would put us a little to rights . You know , as I think I once told you , Osborne has behaved differently to what I should have done , though not wrongly , only what I call an error of judgment . But my father , I 'm sure , has taken up some notion of never mind ; only the end of it is that he holds Osborne still in tacit disgrace , and is miserable himself all the time . Osborne , too , is sore and unhappy , and estranged from my father . It is just what my mother would have put right very soon , and perhaps you could have done it unconsciously , I mean for this wretched mystery that Osborne preserves about his affairs is at the root of it all . But there 's no use talking about it ; I do n't know why I began . "
122533	122561	122529	122529	he	3312	" I ca n't tell you how much I like Miss Kirkpatrick , Molly . It must be a great pleasure to you having such a companion ! "
122562	122565	122567	122567	Molly	147	" Yes , "
122572	122603	122567	122567	Molly	147	" I 'm very fond of her ; and I think I like her better every day I know her . But how quickly you have found out her virtues ! "
122604	122616	122618	122618	he	3312	" I did n't say ' virtues , ' did I ? "
122631	122668	122529	122529	he	3312	" Yet I do n't think one could be deceived in that face . And Mrs. Gibson appears to be a very friendly person , she has asked Osborne and me to dine here on Friday . "
122669	122672	122681	122681	she	147	" Bitter beer "
122685	122691	122681	122681	she	147	" And are you coming ? "
122692	122763	122681	122681	she	147	" Certainly , I am , unless my father wants me ; and I 've given Mrs. Gibson a conditional promise for Osborne , too . So I shall see you all very soon again . But I must go now . I have to keep an appointment seven miles from here in half - an - hour 's time . Good luck to your flower - garden , Molly . "
122798	122802	122827	122827	she	205	" mere manner , "
123172	123184	123156	123156	he	1206	" Have mercy upon me , for I am very miserable . "
123706	123756	123679	123695	The men who had come about the advances made to Osborne by the London money - lender	3351	" Very fine trees sound , perhaps , too , fifty years ago , but gone to rot now ; had wanted lopping and clearing . Was there no wood - ranger or forester ? They were nothing like the value young Mr. Hamley had represented them to be . "
124187	124190	124176	124176	Osborne	205	" fine ; "
124750	124866	124734	124734	He	1206	" You see , all you public schoolboys have a kind of freemasonry of your own , and outsiders are looked on by you much as I look on rabbits and all that is n't game . Ay , you may laugh , but it is so ; and your friends will throw their eyes askance at me , and never think on my pedigree , which would beat theirs all to shivers , I 'll be bound . No ; I 'll have no one here at the Hall who will look down on a Hamley of Hamley , even if he only knows how to make a cross instead of write his name . "
125366	125373	125374	125374	he	1206	" Why is n't dinner ready ? "
125379	125412	125374	125374	he	1206	" It 's ten minutes past six . And , pray , why are you using this wood ? It 's impossible to get oneself warm by such a fire as this . "
125413	125421	125358	125359	the squire	1206	" I believe , sir , that Thomas "
125422	125436	125374	125374	he	1206	" Do n't talk to me of Thomas . Send dinner in directly . "
125613	125621	125623	125623	Osborne	230	" It surely is n't six o'clock ? "
125646	125658	125661	125662	his father	952	" Six o'clock ! It 's more than a quarter past , "
125664	125687	125661	125662	his father	952	" I fancy your watch must be wrong , sir . I set mine by the Horse Guards only two days ago . "
125885	125892	125894	125895	the squire	1206	" My watch is like myself , "
125905	125937	125902	125903	the Scotch	3446	" plain , but steady - going . At any rate , it gives the law in my house . The King may go by the Horse Guards if he likes . "
125938	125946	125948	125948	Osborne	230	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
125957	125991	125948	125948	Osborne	230	" I went by my watch , which is certainly right by London time ; and I 'd no idea you were waiting for me ; otherwise I could have dressed much quicker . "
125992	125998	126000	126001	the Squire	1206	" I should think so , "
126011	126103	126000	126001	the Squire	1206	" When I was a young man I should have been ashamed to have spent as much time at my looking - glass as if I 'd been a girl . I could make myself as smart as any one when I was going to a dance , or to a party where I was likely to meet pretty girls ; but I should have laughed myself to scorn if I 'd stood fiddle - faddling at a glass , smirking at my own likeness , all for my own pleasure . "
126140	126171	126129	126129	he	230	" My mother always expected us all to dress for dinner . I got into the habit of doing it to please her , and I keep it up now . "
126221	126256	126219	126219	himself	230	" And I , too , try to attend to her wishes . I do ; and in more important things . I did when she was alive ; and I do so now . "
126257	126265	126267	126267	Osborne	230	" I never said you did not , "
126279	126379	126219	126219	himself	230	" Yes , you did , sir . You meant it . I could see by your looks . I saw you look at my morning coat . At any rate , I never neglected any wish of hers in her lifetime . If she 'd wished me to go to school again and learn my A , B , C , I would . By I would ; and I would n't have gone playing me , and lounging away my time , for fear of vexing and disappointing her . Yet some folks older than school - boys "
126398	126427	126392	126392	his	1206	" I 'll not have you casting up your mother 's wishes to me , sir . You , who went near to break her heart at last ! "
126525	126616	126508	126508	Osborne	230	" I am only a cause of irritation to you , and home is no longer home to me , but a place in which I am to be controlled in trifles , and scolded about trifles as if I were a child . Put me in a way of making a living for myself that much your oldest son has a right to ask of you I will then leave this house , and you shall be no longer vexed by my dress , or my want of punctuality . "
126617	126660	126667	126667	he	3458	" You make your request pretty much as another son did long ago : ' Give me the portion that falleth to me . ' But I do n't think what he did with his money is much encouragement for me to . "
126673	126676	126508	126508	Osborne	230	" portion , "
126693	126723	126687	126687	Osborne	230	" I 'm as ready as any man to earn my living ; only the preparation for any profession will cost money , and money I have n't got . "
126724	126730	126732	126733	the Squire	1206	" No more have I , "
126737	126745	126747	126747	Osborne	230	" What is to be done then ? "
126757	126823	126687	126687	Osborne	230	" Why , you must learn to stop at home , and not take expensive journeys ; and you must reduce your tailor 's bill . I do n't ask you to help me in the management of the land you 're far too fine a gentleman for that ; but if you ca n't earn money , at least you need n't spend it . "
126824	126837	126839	126839	Osborne	230	" I 've told you I 'm willing enough to earn money , "
126845	126862	126839	126839	Osborne	230	" But how am I to do it ? You really are very unreasonable , sir . "
126863	126867	126869	126870	the Squire	1206	" Am I ? "
126885	126988	126869	126870	the Squire	1206	" But I do n't set up for being reasonable ; men who have to pay away money that they have n't got for their extravagant sons are n't likely to be reasonable . There 's two things you 've gone and done which put me beside myself , when I think of them ; you 've turned out next door to a dunce at college , when your poor mother thought so much of you and when you might have pleased and gratified her so if you chose and , well ! I wo n't say what the other thing is . "
126989	126995	126997	126997	Osborne	230	" Tell me , sir , "
127036	127039	127041	127042	the Squire	1206	" No ! "
127044	127186	127188	127188	he	3469	" I know what I know ; and I 'm not going to tell you how I know it . Only , I 'll just say this your friends no more know a piece of good timber when they see it than you or I know how you could earn five pounds if it was to keep you from starving . Now , there 's Roger we none of us made an ado about him ; but he 'll have his Fellowship now , I 'll warrant him , and be a bishop , or a chancellor , or something , before we 've found out he 's clever we 've been so much taken up thinking about you . I do n't know what 's come over me to speak of ' we ' ' we ' in this way , "
127206	127227	127188	127188	he	3469	" I ought to say ' I ; ' it will be ' I ' for evermore in this world . "
127461	127526	127444	127446	The old butler	3425	" I thought master was n't justly himself , Mr. Osborne , before dinner . And , therefore , I made excuses for him I did . He spoke to Thomas about the fire , sir , which is a thing I could in nowise put up with , unless by reason of sickness , which I am always ready to make allowances for . "
127527	127537	127539	127539	Osborne	230	" Why should n't my father speak to Thomas ? "
127541	127562	127539	127539	Osborne	230	" But , perhaps , he spoke angrily , I daresay ; for I 'm sure he 's not well . "
127563	127754	127444	127446	The old butler	3425	" No , Mr. Osborne , it was n't that . I myself am given to anger ; and I 'm blessed with as good health as any man in my years . Besides , anger 's a good thing for Thomas . He needs a deal of it . But it should come from the right quarter and that is me , myself , Mr. Osborne . I know my place , and I know my rights and duties as well as any butler that lives . And it 's my duty to scold Thomas , and not master 's . Master ought to have said , ' Robinson ! you must speak to Thomas about letting out the fire , ' and I 'd ha ' given it him well , as I shall do now , for that matter . But as I said before , I make excuses for master , as being in mental distress and bodily ill - health ; so I 've brought myself round not to give warning , as I should ha ' done , for certain , under happier circumstances . "
127755	127768	127770	127770	Osborne	230	" Really , Robinson , I think it 's all great nonsense , "
127792	127831	127770	127770	Osborne	230	" What in the world does it signify whether my father speaks to you or to Thomas ? Bring me coffee in the drawing - room , and do n't trouble your head any more about scolding Thomas . "
127858	127997	127843	127843	He	324	" Things is a deal changed since poor missis went . I do n't wonder master feels it , for I 'm sure I do . She was a lady who had always a becoming respect for a butler 's position , and could have understood how he might be hurt in his mind . She 'd never ha ' called his delicacies of feelings nonsense not she ; no more would Mr. Roger . He 's a merry young gentleman , and over fond of bringing dirty , slimy creatures into the house ; but he 's always a kind word for a man who is hurt in his mind . He 'd cheer up the Squire , and keep him from getting so cross and wilful . I wish Mr. Roger was here , I do . "
128121	128127	128128	128128	he	2835	" I 'm getting old , "
128131	128249	128251	128252	the squire	1206	" and my head 's less clear than it used to be . I think sorrow for her has dazed me . I never was much to boast on ; but she thought a deal of me bless her ! She 'd never let me call myself stupid ; but , for all that , I am stupid . Osborne ought to help me . He 's had money enough spent on his learning ; but , instead , he comes down dressed like a popinjay , and never troubles his head to think how I 'm to pay his debts . I wish I 'd told him to earn his living as a dancing - master , "
128263	128363	128259	128259	his	1206	" He 's dressed for all the world like one . And how he 's spent the money no one knows ! Perhaps Roger will turn up some day with a heap of creditors at his heels . No , he wo n't not Roger ; he may be slow , but he 's steady , is old Roger . I wish he was here . He 's not the eldest son , but he 'd take an interest in the estate ; and he 'd do up these weary accounts for me . I wish Roger was here ! "
128946	128959	128961	128961	Osborne	230	" What in the world can I do to secure an income ? "
129055	129343	129345	129345	he	3518	" What can I do to be sure of a present income ? Things can not go on as they are . I should need support for two or three years , even if I entered myself at the Temple , or Lincoln 's Inn . It would be impossible to live on my pay in the army ; besides , I should hate that profession . In fact , there are evils attending all professions I could n't bring myself to become a member of any I 've ever heard of . Perhaps I 'm more fitted to take ' orders ' than anything else ; but to be compelled to write weekly sermons whether one had anything to say or not , and , probably , doomed only to associate with people below one in refinement and education ! Yet poor Aimťe must have money . I ca n't bear to compare our dinners here , overloaded with joints and game and sweets , as Morgan will persist in sending them up , with Aimťe 's two little mutton - chops . Yet what would my father say if he knew I 'd married a Frenchwoman ? In his present mood he 'd disinherit me , if that is possible ; and he 'd speak about her in a way I could n't stand . A Roman Catholic , too ! Well , I do n't repent it . I 'd do it again . Only if my mother had been in good health if she could have heard my story , and known Aimťe ! As it is I must keep it secret ; but where to get money ? Where to get money ? "
129475	129485	129467	129467	their	3519	" To Aimťe , Walking with a Little Child . "
129486	129495	129467	129467	their	3519	" To Aimťe , Singing at her Work . "
129496	129510	129467	129467	their	3519	" To Aimťe , Turning away from me while I told my Love . "
129511	129516	129467	129467	their	3519	" Aimťe 's Confession . "

129534	129539	129467	129467	their	3519	" The Wedding Ring . "
129540	129544	129467	129467	their	3519	" The Wife . "
129564	129568	129552	129552	he	3518	" The wife . "
129631	129634	129595	129596	his father	952	" Boney , "
129640	129643	129595	129596	his father	952	" Johnny Crapaud "
129860	129862	129867	129869	nursery - governess	3540	" bonne "
129928	129934	129936	129936	Osborne	205	" If he saw her ! "
129938	129946	129936	129936	Osborne	205	" If he could but see her ! "
130009	130240	129999	129999	himself	199	" She would make such a loving , sweet , docile little daughter to my father she would go as near as any one could towards filling up the blank void in this house , if he would but have her ; but he wo n't ; he never would ; and he sha'n't have the opportunity of scouting her . Yet if I called her ' Lucy ' in these sonnets ; and if they made a great effect were praised in Blackwood and the Quarterly and all the world was agog to find out the author ; and I told him my secret I could if I were successful I think then he would ask who Lucy was , and I could tell him all then . If how I hate ' ifs . ' ' If me no ifs . ' My life has been based on ' when s ; ' and first they have turned to ' ifs , ' and then they have vanished away . It was ' when Osborne gets honours , ' and then ' if Osborne , ' and then a failure altogether . I said to Aimťe , ' when my mother sees you , ' and now it is ' if my father saw her , ' with a very faint prospect of its ever coming to pass . "
130375	130390	130372	130372	Osborne	205	" I want your advice on a plan I have got in my head , "
130394	130448	130391	130391	Roger	203	" Some one told me that the Duke of Wellington 's maxim was never to give advice unless he could enforce its being carried into effect ; now I ca n't do that ; and you know , old boy , you do n't follow out my advice when you 've got it . "
130449	130563	130352	130352	Roger	203	" Not always , I know . Not when it does n't agree with my own opinion . You 're thinking about this concealment of my marriage ; but you 're not up in all the circumstances . You know how fully I meant to have done it , if there had n't been that row about my debts ; and then my mother 's illness and death . And now you 've no conception how my father is changed how irritable he has become ! Wait till you 've been at home a week ! Robinson , Morgan it 's the same with them all ; but worst of all with me . "
130564	130568	130570	130570	Roger	203	" Poor fellow ! "
130572	130589	130570	130570	Roger	203	" I thought he looked terribly changed : shrunken , and his ruddiness of complexion altered . "
130590	130774	130352	130352	Roger	203	" Why , he hardly takes half the exercise he used to do , so it 's no wonder . He has turned away all the men off the new works , which used to be such an interest to him ; and because the roan cob stumbled with him one day , and nearly threw him , he wo n't ride it ; and yet he wo n't sell it and buy another , which would be the sensible plan ; so there are two old horses eating their heads off , while he is constantly talking about money and expense . And that brings me to what I was going to say . I 'm desperately hard up for money , and so I 've been collecting my poems weeding them well , you know going over them quite critically , in fact ; and I want to know if you think Deighton would publish them . You 've a name in Cambridge , you know ; and I daresay he would look at them if you offered them to him . "
130775	130781	130783	130783	Roger	203	" I can but try , "
130785	130798	130783	130783	Roger	203	" but I 'm afraid you wo n't get much by them . "
130799	130875	130352	130352	Roger	203	" I do n't expect much . I 'm a new man , and must make my name . I should be content with a hundred . If I 'd a hundred pounds I 'd set myself to do something . I might keep myself and Aimťe by my writings while I studied for the bar ; or , if the worst came to the worst , a hundred pounds would take us to Australia . "
130876	130926	130783	130783	Roger	203	" Australia ! Why , Osborne , what could you do there ? And leave my father ! I hope you 'll never get your hundred pounds , if that 's the use you 're to make of it ! Why , you 'd break the Squire 's heart . "
130927	130934	130936	130936	Osborne	205	" It might have done once , "
130940	131027	130936	130936	Osborne	205	" but it would n't now . He looks at me askance , and shies away from conversation with me . Let me alone for noticing and feeling this kind of thing . It 's this very susceptibility to outward things that gives me what faculty I have ; and it seems to me as if my bread , and my wife 's too , were to depend upon it . You 'll soon see for yourself the terms which I am on with my father ! "
131343	131361	131363	131363	Roger	203	" I may come in and have a pipe with you , sir , may n't I ? "
131385	131392	131394	131395	the squire	1206	" You 'll not like it , "
131411	131432	131394	131395	the squire	1206	" The tobacco I use is n't what young men like . Better go and have a cigar with Osborne . "
131433	131451	131394	131395	the squire	1206	" No . I want to sit with you , and I can stand pretty strong tobacco . "
131464	131484	131486	131487	the Squire	1206	" It will make your clothes smell . You 'll have to borrow Osborne 's scents to sweeten yourself , "
131507	131538	131486	131487	the Squire	1206	" No ; I 'll have a churchwarden . Why , father , do you think I 'm a baby to put up with a doll 's head like this ? "
131567	131585	131563	131563	He	1206	" Osborne brought it me when he came back from Germany . That 's three years ago . "
131647	131667	131669	131669	he	1206	" A deal of a man 's life comes and goes in three years I 've found that out ; "
131702	131774	131693	131694	the squire	1206	" I remember when there was all that fuss about the Prince of Wales being made regent , I read somewhere I daresay it was in a newspaper that kings and their heirs - apparent were always on bad terms . Osborne was quite a little chap then : he used to go out riding with me on White Surrey ; you wo n't remember the pony we called White Surrey ? "
131775	131791	131693	131694	the squire	1206	" I remember it ; but I thought it a tall horse in those days . "
131792	131895	131693	131694	the squire	1206	" Ah ! that was because you were such a small lad , you know . I 'd seven horses in the stable then not counting the farm - horses . I do n't recollect having a care then , except she was always delicate , you know . But what a beautiful boy Osborne was ! He was always dressed in black velvet it was a foppery , but it was n't my doing , and it was all right , I 'm sure . He 's a handsome fellow now , but the sunshine has gone out of his face . "
131896	131915	131917	131917	Roger	203	" He 's a good deal troubled about this money , and the anxiety he has given you , "
131928	131932	131934	131935	the Squire	1206	" Not he , "
131960	132150	131934	131935	the Squire	1206	" There ! But never mind ! I say , not he , Roger ! He 's none troubled about the money . It 's easy getting money from Jews if you 're the eldest son , and the heir . They just ask , ' How old is your father , and has he had a stroke , or a fit ? ' and it 's settled out of hand , and then they come prowling about a place , and running down the timber and land Do n't let us speak of him ; it 's no good , Roger . He and I are out of tune , and it seems to me as if only God Almighty could put us to rights . It 's thinking of how he grieved her at last that makes me so bitter with him . And yet there 's a deal of good in him ! and he 's so quick and clever , if only he 'd give his mind to things . Now , you were always slow , Roger all your masters used to say so . "
132155	132169	132171	132171	he	203	" Yes ; I 'd many a nickname at school for my slowness , "
132173	132177	132179	132180	the Squire	1206	" Never mind ! "
132184	132250	132252	132252	he	203	" I 'm sure I do n't . If you were a clever fellow like Osborne yonder , you 'd be all for caring for books and writing , and you 'd perhaps find it as dull as he does to keep company with a bumpkin - squire Jones like me . Yet , I daresay , they think a deal of you at Cambridge , "
132281	132281	132252	132252	he	203	"
132282	132308	132328	132328	he	1206	" Well , yes ! They 're always proud of the senior wrangler of the year up at Cambridge . Next year I must abdicate . "
132346	132379	132328	132328	he	1206	" I used to write to her when she was away in London , and tell her the home news . But no letter will reach her now ! Nothing reaches her ! "
132384	132401	132409	132409	he	203	" Where 's the tobacco - box , father ? Let me fill you another pipe ! "
132425	132534	132422	132422	his	1206	" You 've only just come home , lad . You do n't know me , as I am now - a - days ! Ask Robinson I wo n't have you asking Osborne , he ought to keep it to himself but any of the servants will tell you I 'm not like the same man for getting into passions with them . I used to be reckoned a good master , but that 's past now ! Osborne was once a little boy , and she was once alive and I was once a good master a good master yes ! It 's all past now . "
132600	132632	132594	132595	his father	952	" Well , we 've had a pleasant evening at least , I have . But perhaps you have n't ; for I 'm but poor company now , I know . "
132633	132648	132650	132650	Roger	203	" I do n't know when I 've passed a happier evening , father , "
132867	132873	132874	132874	Roger	203	" art of polite conversation . "
133096	133102	133103	133103	she	252	" It is quite true ! "
133108	133147	133103	133103	she	252	" I was not attending : you see I do n't know even the A B C of science . But , please , do n't look so severely at me , even if I am a dunce ! "
133148	133165	133167	133167	he	203	" I did n't know I did n't mean to look severely , I am sure , "
133176	133184	133186	133187	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Cynthia is not a dunce either , "
133202	133254	133186	133187	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But I have always observed that some people have a talent for one thing and some for another . Now Cynthia 's talents are not for science and the severer studies . Do you remember , love , what trouble I had to teach you the use of the globes ? "
133255	133283	133299	133299	herself	552	" Yes ; and I do n't know longitude from latitude now ; and I 'm always puzzled as to which is perpendicular and which is horizontal . "
133284	133292	133299	133299	herself	552	" Yet , I do assure you , "
133303	133328	133299	133299	herself	552	" that her memory for poetry is prodigious . I have heard her repeat the ' Prisoner of Chillon ' from beginning to end . "
133329	133345	133347	133348	Mr. Gibson	238	" It would be rather a bore to have to hear her , I think , "
133367	133420	133299	133299	herself	552	" Ah , Mr. Gibson , I have found out before now that you have no soul for poetry ; and Molly there is your own child . She reads such deep books all about facts and figures : she 'll be quite a blue - stocking by - and - by . "
133421	133424	133426	133426	Molly	147	" Mamma , "
133430	133465	133426	133426	Molly	147	" you think it was a deep book because there were the shapes of the different cells of bees in it ! but it was not at all deep . It was very interesting . "
133466	133472	133474	133474	Osborne	205	" Never mind , Molly , "
133476	133485	133474	133474	Osborne	205	" I stand up for blue - stockings . "
133486	133499	133501	133501	Roger	203	" And I object to the distinction implied in what you say , "
133503	133527	133501	133501	Roger	203	" It was not deep , ergo , it was very interesting . Now , a book may be both deep and interesting . "
133528	133555	133557	133558	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , if you are going to chop logic and use Latin words , I think it is time for us to leave the room , "
133560	133575	133577	133577	Cynthia	252	" Do n't let us run away as if we were beaten , mamma , "
133579	133656	133577	133577	Cynthia	252	" Though it may be logic , I , for one , can understand what Mr. Roger Hamley said just now ; and I read some of Molly 's books ; and whether it was deep or not I found it very interesting more so than I should think the ' Prisoner of Chillon ' now - a - days . I 've displaced the Prisoner to make room for Johnnie Gilpin as my favourite poem . "
133657	133667	133669	133670	Mrs. Gibson	189	" How could you talk such nonsense , Cynthia ! "
133679	133742	133669	133670	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You know you are not a dunce . It is all very well not to be a blue - stocking , because gentle - people do n't like that kind of woman ; but running yourself down , and contradicting all I said about your liking for Byron , and poets and poetry to Osborne Hamley of all men , too ! "
133751	133756	133757	133757	Cynthia	252	" But , mamma , "
133760	133802	133757	133757	Cynthia	252	" I am either a dunce , or I am not . If I am , I did right to own it ; if I am not , he 's a dunce if he does n't find out I was joking . "
133803	133806	133808	133809	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Well , "
133824	133850	133757	133757	Cynthia	252	" Only that if he 's a dunce his opinion of me is worth nothing . So , any way , it does n't signify . "
133851	133869	133757	133757	Cynthia	252	" You really bewilder me with your nonsense , child . Molly is worth twenty of you . "
133870	133879	133881	133881	Cynthia	252	" I quite agree with you , mamma , "
133891	133901	133903	133904	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ; but she ought not to be , "
133909	133918	133903	133904	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Think of the advantages you 've had . "
133919	133935	133937	133937	Molly	147	" I 'm afraid I had rather be a dunce than a blue - stocking , "
133955	134013	133903	133904	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Hush ; here they are coming : I hear the dining - room door ! I never meant you were a blue - stocking , dear , so do n't look vexed . Cynthia , my love , where did you get those lovely flowers anemones , are they ? They suit your complexion so exactly . "
134014	134027	134029	134029	Cynthia	252	" Come , Molly , do n't look so grave and thoughtful , "
134031	134045	134029	134029	Cynthia	252	" Do n't you perceive mamma wants us to be smiling and amiable ? "
134133	134147	134149	134149	he	203	" There is a charity ball in Hollingford soon , is n't there ? "
134151	134158	134159	134159	she	252	" Yes ; on Easter Tuesday , "
134162	134172	134205	134205	she	252	" Are you going ? I suppose you are ? "
134173	134185	134205	134205	she	252	" Yes ; mamma is going to take Molly and me . "
134186	134196	134205	134205	she	252	" You will enjoy it very much going together ? "
134219	134239	134216	134216	her	252	" Yes ; going together will make the enjoyment of the thing . It would be dull without her . "
134240	134248	134249	134249	he	203	" You are great friends , then ? "
134252	134269	134216	134216	her	252	" I never thought I should like any one so much , any girl I mean . "
134305	134329	134300	134300	his	203	" I was so anxious to know . I am so glad . I have often wondered how you two were getting on . "
134330	134334	134336	134336	she	252	" Have you ? "
134342	134354	134336	134336	she	252	" At Cambridge ? You must be very fond of Molly ! "
134355	134383	134300	134300	his	203	" Yes , I am . She was with us so long ; and at such a time ! I look upon her almost as a sister . "
134384	134414	134416	134416	she	252	" And she is very fond of all of you . I seem to know you all from hearing her talk about you so much . All of you ! "
134422	134424	134416	134416	she	252	" all "
134447	134491	134438	134438	Roger	203	" I did n't know you , even by hearsay . So you must n't wonder that I was a little afraid . But as soon as I saw you I knew how it must be ; and it was such a relief ! "
134492	134495	134497	134498	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Cynthia , "
134517	134532	134509	134509	his	3611	" come here , and sing that little French ballad to Mr. Osborne Hamley . "
134533	134549	134497	134498	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Which do you mean , mamma ? ' Tu t'en repentiras , Colin ? ' "
134550	134564	134566	134567	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ; such a pretty , playful little warning to young men , "
134574	134577	134566	134567	Mrs. Gibson	189	" The refrain is
134635	134635	134625	134626	an Englishman	3616	"
134636	134643	134597	134599	Tu t'en repentiras	9101	" Tu t'en repentiras , Colin . "
134644	134651	134625	134626	an Englishman	3616	" Tu t'en repentiras , Colin . "
134875	134885	134863	134863	He	203	" Too late a warning , is it not ? "
134903	134911	134863	134863	He	203	" Oh , I am so sorry ! "
134912	134941	134892	134892	he	203	" You need not be . He wo n't mind it long ; and a man must take the consequences when he puts himself in a false position . "
135064	135071	135073	135073	Roger	203	" They are talking about France , "
135083	135117	135073	135073	Roger	203	" Osborne knows it well , and Miss Kirkpatrick has been at school there , you know . It sounds very interesting ; shall we go nearer and hear what they are saying ? "
135242	135245	135235	135235	she	147	" mean , "
135247	135252	135235	135235	she	147	" envious of Cynthia , "
135254	135259	135235	135235	she	147	" ill - natured , "
135264	135292	135235	135235	she	147	" were the terms she kept applying to herself ; but it did no good , she was just as naughty at the last as at the first .
135488	135499	135501	135502	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Now , you must play a little , Molly , "
135504	135517	135501	135502	Mrs. Gibson	189	" play us that beautiful piece of Kalkbrenner 's , my dear . "
135544	135575	135518	135518	Molly	147	" Go at once , my dear . You may not play it quite rightly ; and I know you are very nervous ; but you 're quite amongst friends . "
135598	135604	135606	135606	she	147	" Please , go away ! "
135620	135639	135608	135608	Osborne	230	" I can quite well do it for myself . And oh ! if you would but talk ! "
135750	135758	135760	135760	Molly	147	" There , now I 've done ! "
135776	135789	135768	135768	she	147	" and I think I will never sit down to play again ! "
136175	136178	136190	136190	she	189	" county family "
136750	136754	136730	136731	attentive masons	3664	" my lord , "
137183	137188	137190	137191	Mrs. Gibson	189	" The dear countess ! "
137259	137268	137257	137257	she	189	" Menteith , Duke of , Adolphus George , "
137462	137481	137459	137459	she	168	" Why , Clare ! you dear woman ! are you here all alone ? Does mamma know ? "
137601	137626	137591	137591	she	189	" Oh , my lord ! I never eat meat in the middle of the day ; I can hardly eat anything at lunch . "
137759	137969	137749	137750	Lady Cumnor	150	" Well , Clare ! I am really glad to see you . I once thought I should never get back to the Towers , but here I am ! There was such a clever man at Bath a Doctor Snape he cured me at last quite set me up . I really think if ever I am ill again I shall send for him : it is such a thing to find a really clever medical man . Oh , by the way , I always forget you 've married Mr. Gibson of course he is very clever , and all that . The carriage to the door in ten minutes , Brown , and desire Bradley to bring my things down . What was I asking you ? Oh ! how do you get on with the stepdaughter ? She seemed to me to be a young lady with a pretty stubborn will of her own . I put a letter for the post down somewhere , and I can not think where ; do help me look for it , there 's a good woman . Just run to my room , and see if Brown can find it , for it is of great consequence . "
138056	138069	138044	138044	she	150	" Every iota from Paris ! Every i - o - ta ! "
138115	138117	138119	138119	she	150	" Clare "
138164	138173	138174	138174	she	168	" We shall see you at the ball , "
138177	138225	138174	138174	she	168	" You 'll be there with your two girls , of course , and I must have a little talk with you there ; with all these visitors in the house , it has been impossible to see anything of you to - day , you know . "
138253	138493	138174	138174	she	168	" There are many visitors staying at the Towers oh , yes ! a great many : the duchess and Lady Alice , and Mr. and Mrs. Grey , and Lord Albert Monson and his sister , and my old friend Captain James of the Blues many more , in fact . But , of course , I preferred going to Lady Cumnor 's own room , where I could see her and Lady Harriet quietly , and where we were not disturbed by the bustle downstairs . Of course we were obliged to go down to lunch , and then I saw my old friends , and renewed pleasant acquaintances . But I really could hardly get any connected conversation with any one . Lord Cumnor seemed so delighted to see me there again : though there were six or seven between us , he was always interrupting with some civil or kind speech especially addressed to me . And after lunch Lady Cumnor asked me all sorts of questions about my new life with as much interest as if I had been her daughter . To be sure , when the duchess came in we had to leave off , and talk about the trousseau she is preparing for Lady Alice . Lady Harriet made such a point of our meeting at the ball ; she is such a good , affectionate creature , is Lady Harriet ! "
138530	138544	138519	138520	a servant	1981	" with the Mr. Hamleys ' compliments to Miss Gibson and Miss Kirkpatrick . "
138597	138616	138553	138553	She	252	" Look , Molly , look ! Here are bouquets for us ! Long life to the givers ! "
138617	138623	138625	138625	Molly	147	" Who are they from ? "
138642	138665	138553	138553	She	252	" Who from ? Why , the two paragons of Hamleys , to be sure . Is it not a pretty attention ? "
138666	138672	138674	138674	Molly	147	" How kind of them ! "
138676	138709	138553	138553	She	252	" I 'm sure it is Osborne who thought of it . He has been so much abroad , where it is such a common compliment to send bouquets to young ladies . "
138710	138725	138727	138727	Molly	147	" I do n't see why you should think it is Osborne 's thought ! "
138733	138751	138727	138727	Molly	147	" Mr. Roger Hamley used to gather nosegays constantly for his mother , and sometimes for me . "
138752	138795	138797	138797	Cynthia	252	" Well , never mind whose thought it was , or who gathered them ; we 've got the flowers , and that 's enough . Molly , I 'm sure these red flowers will just match your coral necklace and bracelets , "
138811	138819	138821	138821	Molly	147	" Oh , please , do n't ! "
138823	138845	138821	138821	Molly	147	" Do n't you see how carefully the colours are arranged they have taken such pains ; please , do n't . "
138846	138849	138851	138851	Cynthia	252	" Nonsense ! "
138893	138893	138821	138821	Molly	147	"
138894	138907	138909	138909	Molly	147	" Oh , I am so sorry ! It is quite spoilt , "
138911	138946	138947	138947	Cynthia	252	" Never mind ! I 'll take this spoilt bouquet ; I can make it up again just as prettily as ever ; and you shall have this , which has never been touched . "
138976	138979	138981	138981	Cynthia	252	" There ! "
138986	139027	138981	138981	Cynthia	252	" when that is sewn on black velvet , to keep the flowers from dying , you 'll see how pretty it will look . And there are enough red flowers in this untouched nosegay to carry out the idea ! "
139028	139031	138947	138947	Cynthia	252	" Thank you "
139035	139048	138947	138947	Cynthia	252	" But sha'n't you mind having only the wrecks of the other ? "
139049	139063	138981	138981	Cynthia	252	" Not I ; red flowers would not go with my pink dress . "
139064	139075	138947	138947	Cynthia	252	" But I daresay they arranged each nosegay so carefully ! "
139076	139122	138981	138981	Cynthia	252	" Perhaps they did . But I never would allow sentiment to interfere with my choice of colours ; and pink does tie one down . Now you , in white muslin , just tipped with crimson , like a daisy , may wear anything . "
139373	139381	139364	139364	Molly	147	" I should like to be pretty ! "
139382	139387	139389	139389	Cynthia	252	" Why , Molly , "
139443	139462	139440	139440	she	252	" The French girls would tell you , to believe that you were pretty would make you so . "
139468	139504	139463	139463	Molly	147	" I suppose they would mean that if you knew you were pretty , you would never think about your looks ; you would be so certain of being liked , and that it is caring "
139505	139542	139463	139463	Molly	147	" Listen ! that 's eight o'clock striking . Do n't trouble yourself with trying to interpret a French girl 's meaning , but help me on with my frock , there 's a dear one . "
139659	139675	139677	139677	Molly	147	" Here , Miss Kirkpatrick ! No , it 's not for you , miss ! "
139695	139711	139677	139677	Molly	147	" It 's for Miss Kirkpatrick ; and there 's a note for her besides ! "
139773	139778	139780	139780	Molly	147	" Who is it ? "
139808	139814	139816	139816	she	252	" It is Mr. Preston , "
139823	139836	139816	139816	she	252	" I shall not dance with him ; and here go his flowers "
139896	139899	139901	139901	Molly	147	" Oh ! "
139903	139916	139901	139901	Molly	147	" those beautiful flowers ! We might have put them in water . "
139917	139920	139922	139922	Cynthia	247	" No , "
139924	139950	139922	139922	Cynthia	247	" it 's best to destroy them . We do n't want them ; and I ca n't bear to be reminded of that man . "
139951	139959	139961	139961	Molly	147	" It was an impertinent familiar note , "
139963	139997	139961	139961	Molly	147	" What right had he to express himself in that way no beginning , no end , and only initials ! Did you know him well when you were at Ashcombe , Cynthia ? "
139998	140011	140013	140013	Cynthia	247	" Oh , do n't let us think any more about him , "
140015	140061	140013	140013	Cynthia	247	" It is quite enough to spoil any pleasure at the ball to think that he will be there . But I hope I shall get engaged before he comes , so that I ca n't dance with him and do n't you , either ! "
140062	140071	140073	140073	Molly	147	" There ! they are calling for us , "
140461	140467	140468	140468	They	3755	" regardless of their doom . "
140510	140515	140566	140566	she	159	" town 's livery , "
140536	140539	140566	140566	she	159	" flys , "
140561	140564	140566	140566	she	159	" which , "
140577	140627	140566	140566	she	159	" came into the parlour , and got full of the warm air , and nipped you up , and carried you tight and cosy into another warm room , where you could walk out without having to show your legs by going up steps , or down steps . "
140796	140817	140787	140787	they	3780	" Upon my word , I really do think this is a better room than our Ashcombe Court - house ! "
140818	140826	140829	140830	Miss Piper	341	" And how prettily it is decorated ! "
140832	140849	140829	140830	Miss Piper	341	" How well the roses are made ! But you all have such taste at Hollingford . "
140850	140856	140862	140862	she	342	" There 's Mrs. Dempster , "
140962	140962	140959	140960	Miss Browning	159	"
141009	141080	141003	141003	she	159	" You must be glad , I am sure , to have somebody you can call in , if you are in any sudden hurry , or for things that are too trifling to trouble Mr. Gibson about ; and I should think Mr. Roscoe would feel it a great advantage to profit , as he will naturally have the opportunity of doing , by witnessing Mr. Gibson 's skill ! "
141141	141154	141133	141133	he	344	" Who is that lovely girl in pink , just come in ? "
141155	141163	141165	141166	Miss Hornblower	342	" Why , that 's Cynthia Kirkpatrick ! "
141181	141222	141165	141166	Miss Hornblower	342	" How she has grown ! To be sure , it is two or three years since she left Ashcombe she was very pretty then people did say Mr. Preston admired her very much ; but she was so young ! "
141223	141229	141231	141234	the impatient young surgeon	3792	" Can you introduce me ? "
141236	141246	141231	141234	the impatient young surgeon	3792	" I should like to ask her to dance . "
141282	141449	141273	141273	she	342	" Well , to be sure ! How condescending we are ! I remember the time when Mrs. Kirkpatrick wore old black silks , and was thankful and civil as became her place as a schoolmistress , and as having to earn her bread . And now she is in a satin ; and she speaks to me as if she just could recollect who I was , if she tried very hard ! It is n't so long ago since Mrs. Dempster came to consult me as to whether Mrs. Kirkpatrick would be offended , if she sent her a new breadth for her lilac silk - gown , in place of one that had been spoilt by Mrs. Dempster 's servant spilling the coffee over it the night before ; and she took it and was thankful , for all she 's dressed in pearl - grey satin now ! And she would have been glad enough to marry Mr. Preston in those days . "
141450	141460	141463	141464	Miss Browning	159	" I thought you said he admired her daughter , "
141470	141523	141273	141273	she	342	" Well ! perhaps I did , and perhaps it was so ; I 'm sure I ca n't tell ; he was a great deal at the house . Miss Dixon keeps a school in the same house now , and I 'm sure she does it a great deal better . "
141524	141537	141539	141540	Miss Browning	159	" The earl and the countess are very fond of Mrs. Gibson , "
141542	141579	141539	141540	Miss Browning	159	" I know , for Lady Harriet told us when she came to drink tea with us last autumn ; and they desired Mr. Preston to be very attentive to her when she lived at Ashcombe . "
141580	141623	141624	141625	Miss Hornblower	342	" For goodness ' sake do n't go and repeat what I 've been saying about Mr. Preston and Mrs. Kirkpatrick to her ladyship . One may be mistaken , and you know I only said ' people talked about it . ' "
141748	141776	141886	141887	that lady	2220	" What a lovely turban you have got on , Miss Piper , if I may be allowed to say so : so becoming to your complexion ! "
141777	141783	141785	141786	Miss Piper	341	" Do you think so ? "
141800	141802	141886	141887	that lady	2220	" complexion "
141808	141855	141886	141887	that lady	2220	" I got it at Brown 's , at Somerton , for this very ball . I thought I must have something to set off my gown , which is n't quite so new as it once was ; and I have no handsome jewellery like you "
141880	141885	141886	141887	that lady	2220	" It is handsome , "
141890	142138	141886	141887	that lady	2220	" It is a likeness of my dear mother ; Dorothy has got my father on . The miniatures were both taken at the same time ; and just about then my uncle died and left us each a legacy of fifty pounds , which we agreed to spend on the setting of our miniatures . But because they are so valuable Dorothy always keeps them locked up with the best silver , and hides the box somewhere ; she never will tell me where , because she says I 've such weak nerves , and that if a burglar , with a loaded pistol at my head , were to ask me where we kept our plate and jewels , I should be sure to tell him ; and she says , for her part , she would never think of revealing under any circumstances . I 'm sure I hope she wo n't be tried . But that 's the reason I do n't wear it often ; it 's only the second time I 've had it on ; and I ca n't even get at it , and look at it , which I should like to do . I should n't have had it on to - night , but that Dorothy gave it out to me , saying it was but a proper compliment to pay to the Duchess of Menteith , who is to be here in all her diamonds . "
142139	142160	142211	142211	she	341	" Dear - ah - me ! Is she really ! Do you know I never saw a duchess before . "
142176	142181	142211	142211	she	341	" behave herself properly , "
142201	142205	142211	142211	she	341	" her grace . "
142225	142238	142211	142211	she	341	" Look , look ! that 's our Mr. Cholmley , the magistrate "
142247	142356	142239	142239	he	3802	" and that 's Mrs. Cholmley in red satin , and Mr. George and Mr. Harry from Oxford , I do declare ; and Miss Cholmley , and pretty Miss Sophy . I should like to go and speak to them , but then it 's so formidable crossing a room without a gentleman . And there is Coxe the butcher and his wife ! Why all Coreham seems to be here ! And how Mrs. Coxe can afford such a gown I ca n't make out for one , for I know Coxe had some difficulty in paying for the last sheep he bought of my brother . "
142508	142542	142476	142476	She	189	" Your dear papa is always so very punctual ! To - night it seems almost a pity , for we really are here before there is any one come that we know . "
142543	142571	142476	142476	She	189	" Oh ! I see so many people here that I know . There are Mr. and Mrs. Smeaton , and that nice good - tempered daughter . "
142572	142582	142476	142476	She	189	" Oh ! booksellers and butchers if you will . "
142583	142595	142476	142476	She	189	" Papa has found a great many friends to talk to . "
142596	142613	142476	142476	She	189	" Patients , my dear hardly friends . There are some nice - looking people here , "
142621	142678	142476	142476	She	189	" but I daresay they have driven over from the neighbourhood of Ashcombe or Coreham , and have hardly calculated how soon they would get here . I wonder when the Towers ' party will come . Ah ! there 's Mr. Ashton , and Mr. Preston . Come , the room is beginning to fill . "
143207	143225	143202	143202	she	189	" The rooms are not well - lighted to - night , are they , Mr. Preston ? "
143226	143229	143231	143231	he	247	" No , "
143233	143257	143231	143231	he	247	" but who could light such dingy old paint as this , loaded with evergreens , too , which always darken a room ? "
143258	143337	143202	143202	she	189	" And the company , too ! I always think that freshness and brilliancy of dress go as far as anything to brighten up a room . Look what a set of people are here : the greater part of the women are dressed in dark silks , really only fit for a morning . The place will be quite different , by - and - by , when the county families are in a little more force . "
143469	143478	143461	143461	she	189	" You are not dancing , Mr. Preston ! "
143479	143502	143461	143461	she	189	" No ! The partner I had engaged has made some mistake . I am waiting to have an explanation with her . "
143616	143672	143605	143606	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Your last partner was a gentleman , my dear . You are improving in your selection . I really was ashamed of you before , figuring away with that attorney 's clerk . Molly , do you know whom you have been dancing with ? I have found out he is the Coreham bookseller . "
143673	143694	143696	143696	Molly	147	" That accounts for his being so well up in all the books I 've been wanting to hear about , "
143710	143719	143720	143720	she	147	" He really was very pleasant , mamma , "
143723	143735	143720	143720	she	147	" and he looks quite a gentleman , and dances beautifully ! "
143736	143771	143773	143774	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Very well . But remember if you go on this way you will have to shake hands over the counter to - morrow morning with some of your partners of to - night , "
143778	143824	143826	143826	Molly	147	" But I really do n't know how to refuse when people are introduced to me and ask me , and I am longing to dance . You know to - night it is a charity ball , and papa said everybody danced with everybody , "
143903	143926	143890	143890	he	247	" If Miss Gibson finds any difficulty in refusing a partner , she has only to apply to Miss Kirkpatrick for instructions . "
143958	144000	143930	143930	her	252	" You forget , I think , Mr. Preston : Miss Gibson implied that she wished to dance with the person who asked her that makes all the difference . I ca n't instruct her how to act in that difficulty . "
144216	144247	144208	144208	she	147	" Miss Kirkpatrick has not done me the honour of wearing the bouquet I sent her , I see . She received it , I suppose , and my note ? "
144248	144251	144253	144253	Molly	147	" Yes , "
144266	144276	144253	144253	Molly	147	" But we had already accepted these two nosegays . "
144318	144380	144300	144300	She	189	" Oh , yes , we were so sorry ! Of course , I do n't mean to say we could be sorry for any one 's kindness ; but two such lovely nosegays had been sent from Hamley Hall you may see how beautiful from what Molly holds in her hand and they had come before yours , Mr. Preston . "
144381	144446	144487	144487	his	247	" I should have felt honoured if you had accepted of mine , since the young ladies were so well provided for . I was at some pains in selecting the flowers at Green 's ; I think I may say it was rather more recherchť than that of Miss Kirkpatrick 's , which Miss Gibson holds so tenderly and securely in her hand . "
144447	144465	144467	144467	Molly	147	" Oh , because Cynthia would take out the most effective flowers to put in my hair ! "
144471	144475	144477	144478	Mr. Preston	247	" Did she ? "
144718	144724	144725	144725	she	147	" I had a headache , "
144728	144992	144725	144725	she	147	" and I should have sent my money , and never stirred out o ' doors to - night ; for I 've seen a many of these here balls , and my lord and my lady too , when they were better worth looking at nor they are now ; but every one was talking of the duchess , and the duchess and her diamonds , and I thought I should n't like to be behindhand , and never ha ' seen neither the duchess nor her diamonds ; so I 'm here , and coal and candle - light wasting away at home , for I told Sally to sit up for me ; and , above everything , I can not abide waste . I took it from my mother , who was such a one against waste as you never see now - a - days . She was a manager , if ever there was a one ; and brought up nine children on less than any one else could do , I 'll be bound . Why ! she would n't let us be extravagant not even in the matter of colds . Whenever any on us had got a pretty bad cold , she took the opportunity and cut our hair ; for she said , said she , it was of no use having two colds when one would do and cutting of our hair was sure to give us a cold . But , for all that , I wish the duchess would come . "
144993	145004	145007	145008	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ah ! but fancy what it is to me , "
145086	145086	145064	145065	Lady Harriet	168	"
145476	145480	145499	145500	Lady Harriet	168	" Money - musk "
145543	145560	145562	145562	Molly	147	" Here we are at last . How d'ye do , dear ? Why , little one "
145564	145577	145562	145562	Molly	147	" how nice you 're looking ! Are n't we shamefully late ? "
145578	145588	145590	145591	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh ! it 's only just past twelve , "
145593	145602	145590	145591	Mrs. Gibson	189	" and I daresay you dined very late . "
145603	145742	145562	145562	Molly	147	" It was n't that ; it was that ill - mannered woman , who went to her own room after we came out from dinner , and she and Lady Alice stayed there invisible , till we thought they were putting on some splendid attire as they ought to have done and at half - past ten , when mamma sent up to them to say the carriages were at the door , the duchess sent down for some beef - tea , and at last appeared a l'enfant as you see her . Mamma is so angry with her , and some of the others are annoyed at not coming earlier , and one or two are giving themselves airs about coming at all . Papa is the only one who is not affected by it . "
145751	145761	145746	145748	Molly Lady Harriet	3897	" Have you been dancing much , Miss Gibson ? "
145762	145773	145746	145748	Molly Lady Harriet	3897	" Yes ; not every dance , but nearly all . "
145869	145907	145909	145909	she	189	" I wo n't go back to those people , I am so mad with them ; and , besides , I hardly saw you the other day , and I must have some gossip with you . "
145924	145930	145918	145919	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" looked like anybody else . "
146084	146148	146062	146062	she	189	" Such a shabby thing for a duchess I never saw ; not a bit of a diamond near her ! They 're none of 'em worth looking at except the countess , and she 's always a personable woman , and not so lusty as she was . But they 're not worth waiting up for till this time o ' night . "
146167	146207	146157	146158	Lady Harriet	168	" You do n't remember me , but I know you from having seen you at the Towers . Lady Cumnor is a good deal thinner than she was , but we hope her health is better for it . "
146208	146214	146216	146217	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It 's Lady Harriet , "
146226	146317	146157	146158	Lady Harriet	168	" Deary me , your ladyship ! I hope I 've given no offence ! But , you see that is to say , your ladyship sees , that it 's late hours for such folks as me , and I only stayed out of my bed to see the duchess , and I thought she 'd come in diamonds and a coronet ; and it puts one out at my age , to be disappointed in the only chance I 'm like to have of so fine a sight . "
146318	146325	146327	146328	Lady Harriet	168	" I 'm put out too , "
146330	146372	146327	146328	Lady Harriet	168	" I wanted to have come early , and here we are as late as this . I 'm so cross and ill - tempered , I should be glad to hide myself in bed as soon as you will do . "
146393	146428	146429	146430	Lady Harriet	168	" I do n't believe as ever your ladyship can be cross and ill - tempered with that pretty face . I 'm an old woman , so you must let me say so . "
146449	146499	146446	146446	she	168	" I wo n't keep you up any longer ; but I 'll promise one thing in return for your pretty speech : if ever I am a duchess , I 'll come and show myself to you in all my robes and gewgaws . Good night , madam ! "
146500	146510	146512	146512	she	168	" There ! I knew how it would be ! "
146519	146530	146512	146512	she	168	" And on the eve of a county election too . "
146531	146573	146575	146576	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh ! you must not take old Mrs. Goodenough as a specimen , dear Lady Harriet . She is always a grumbler ! I am sure no one else would complain of your all being as late as you liked , "
146578	146586	146588	146589	Lady Harriet	168	" What do you say , Molly ? "
146600	146640	146593	146593	her	168	" Do n't you think we 've lost some of our popularity , which at this time means votes by coming so late . Come , answer me ! you used to be a famous little truth - teller . "
146641	146651	146653	146653	Molly	147	" I do n't know about popularity or votes , "
146658	146682	146683	146683	she	147	" But I think many people were sorry you did not come sooner ; and is n't that rather a proof of popularity ? "
146686	146696	146698	146699	Lady Harriet	168	" That 's a very neat and diplomatic answer , "
146712	146719	146721	146722	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly knows nothing about it , "
146730	146754	146721	146722	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It would be very impertinent if she or any one else questioned Lady Cumnor 's perfect right to come when she chose . "
146755	146814	146709	146709	her	168	" Well , all I know is , I must go back to mamma now ; but I shall make another raid into these regions by - and - by , and you must keep a place for me . Ah ! there are Miss Brownings ; you see I do n't forget my lesson , Miss Gibson . "
146815	146829	146831	146832	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly , I can not have you speaking so to Lady Harriet , "
146845	146873	146831	146832	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You would never have known her at all if it had not been for me , and do n't be always putting yourself into our conversation . "
146874	146885	146887	146887	Molly	147	" But I must speak if she asks me questions , "
146889	146929	146709	146709	her	168	" Well ! if you must , you must , I acknowledge . I 'm candid about that at any rate . But there 's no need for you to set up to have an opinion at your age . "
146930	146940	146942	146942	Molly	147	" I do n't know how to help it , "
146944	147011	146709	146709	her	168	" She 's such a whimsical person ; look there , if she 's not talking to Miss Phobe ; and Miss Phobe is so weak she 'll be easily led away into fancying she is hand and glove with Lady Harriet . If there is one thing I hate more than another , it is the trying to make out an intimacy with great people . "
147130	147138	147140	147140	she	147	" What is the matter , Cynthia ? "
147148	147151	147153	147153	Cynthia	247	" Nothing , "
147172	147178	147153	147153	Cynthia	247	" Why should there be ? "
147179	147197	147167	147167	her	147	" I do n't know ; but you look different to what you did tired or something . "
147198	147223	147153	147153	Cynthia	247	" There 's nothing the matter , or , if there is , do n't talk about it . It 's all your fancy . "
147337	147347	147322	147322	she	147	" Is Cynthia going to dance with Mr. Preston ? "
147494	147497	147498	147498	she	168	" Hollingford ! "
147529	147560	147498	147498	she	168	" you do n't know how these good people here have been hurt and disappointed with our being so late , and with the duchess 's ridiculous simplicity of dress . "
147561	147568	147570	147570	he	3916	" Why should they mind it ? "
147583	147620	147502	147502	her	168	" Oh , do n't be so wise and stupid ; do n't you see , we 're a show and a spectacle it 's like having a pantomime with harlequin and columbine in plain clothes . "
147621	147627	147628	147628	he	3916	" I do n't understand how "
147631	147692	147502	147502	her	168	" Then take it upon trust . They really are a little disappointed , whether they are logical or not in being so , and we must try and make it up to them ; for one thing , because I ca n't bear our vassals to look dissatisfied and disloyal , and then there 's the election in June . "
147693	147708	147502	147502	her	168	" I really would as soon be out of the House as in it . "
147709	147793	147794	147794	She	3918	" Nonsense ; it would grieve papa beyond measure but there 's no time to talk about that now . You must go and dance with some of the townspeople , and I 'll ask Sheepshanks to introduce me to a respectable young farmer . Ca n't you get Captain James to make himself useful ? There he goes with Lady Alice ! If I do n't get him introduced to the ugliest tailor 's daughter I can find for the next dance ! "
147822	147855	147803	147803	she	3918	" Pray do n't , Harriet . You know I ca n't dance . I hate it ; I always did . I do n't know how to get through a quadrille . "
147856	147863	147865	147865	she	3918	" It 's a country dance ! "
147869	147921	147803	147803	she	3918	" It 's all the same . And what shall I say to my partner ? I have n't a notion : I shall have no subject in common . Speak of being disappointed , they 'll be ten times more disappointed when they find I can neither dance nor talk ! "
147922	148044	148045	148047	Poor Lord Hollingford	188	" I 'll be merciful ; do n't be so cowardly . In their eyes a lord may dance like a bear as some lords not very far from me are if he likes , and they 'll take it for grace . And you shall begin with Molly Gibson , your friend the doctor 's daughter . She 's a good , simple , intelligent little girl , which you 'll think a great deal more of , I suppose , than of the frivolous fact of her being very pretty . Clare ! will you allow me to introduce my brother to Miss Gibson ? he hopes to engage her for this dance . Lord Hollingford , Miss Gibson ! "
148231	148245	148246	148246	He	188	" Cross hands and back again , down the middle and up again . "
148631	148685	148627	148627	himself	188	" What a charming little lady that daughter of yours is ! Most girls of her age are so difficult to talk to ; but she is intelligent and full of interest in all sorts of sensible things ; well read , too she was up in Le Regne Animal and very pretty ! "
149054	149113	149049	149050	her mother	552	" Cynthia ! ca n't you take up a book and improve yourself ? I am sure your conversation will never be worth listening to , unless you read something better than newspapers . Why do n't you keep up your French ? There was some French book that Molly was reading Le Regne Animal , I think . "
149114	149122	149124	149124	Molly	147	" No ! I never read it ! "
149128	149154	149124	149124	Molly	147	" Mr. Roger Hamley sometimes read pieces out of it when I was first at the Hall , and told me what it was about . "
149155	149192	149049	149050	her mother	552	" Oh ! well . Then I suppose I was mistaken . But it comes to all the same thing . Cynthia , you really must learn to settle yourself to some improving reading every morning . "
149235	149238	149049	149050	her mother	552	" improving reading "
149453	149466	149467	149467	Roger	203	" a Katherine pear on the side that 's next the sun . "
149627	149679	149683	149683	he	952	" as he termed it , to bear well with the Squire 's gloomy fits , or too frequent querulousness . The consciousness of his secret , too , made Osborne uncomfortable in his father 's presence . It was very well for all parties that Roger was not ' sensitive , "
149806	149809	149799	149799	he	3985	" fractious , "
149905	149980	149885	149885	Robinson	324	" His lordship was very sorry not to see you , Mr. Roger , and his lordship left a note for you . Mr. Osborne took it , I think , when he passed through . I asked his lordship if he would like to see Mr. Osborne , who was indoors , as I thought . But his lordship said he was pressed for time , and told me to make his excuses . "
149981	149989	149991	149992	the Squire	1206	" Did n't he ask for me ? "
149994	150036	149885	149885	Robinson	324	" No , sir ; I ca n't say as his lordship did . He would never have thought of Mr. Osborne , sir , if I had n't named him . It was Mr. Roger he seemed so keen after . "
150037	150041	150043	150044	the Squire	1206	" Very odd , "
150118	150123	150124	150124	he	230	" Oh , Roger ! "
150133	150144	150124	150124	he	230	" here 's been Lord Hollingford wanting to see you . "
150145	150149	150151	150151	Roger	203	" I know , "
150153	150192	150193	150194	The Squire	1206	" And he 's left a note for you . Robinson tried to persuade him it was for my father , so he 's added a ' junior ' Roger Hamley , Esq . , junior in pencil . "
150226	150232	150234	150235	the Squire	1206	" What does he say ? "
150417	150482	150377	150378	Lord Hollingford	188	" So my lord lieutenant is taking some notice of the Hamleys at last . The election is coming on , is it ? But I can tell him we 're not to be got so easily . I suppose this trap is set for you , Osborne ? What 's this you 've been writing that the French mounseer is so taken with ? "
150483	150491	150493	150493	Osborne	230	" It is not me , sir ! "
150495	150504	150493	150493	Osborne	230	" Both note and call are for Roger . "
150505	150512	150514	150515	the Squire	1206	" I do n't understand it , "
150517	150585	150514	150515	the Squire	1206	" These Whig fellows have never done their duty by me ; not that I want it of them . The Duke of Debenham used to pay the Hamleys a respect due to 'em the oldest landowners in the county but since he died , and this shabby Whig lord has succeeded him , I 've never dined at the lord lieutenant 's no , not once . "
150586	150613	150615	150615	Roger	203	" But I think , sir , I 've heard you say Lord Cumnor used to invite you , only you did not choose to go , "
150617	150672	150514	150515	the Squire	1206	" Yes . What d'ye mean by that ? Do you suppose I was going to desert the principles of my family , and curry favour with the Whigs ? No ! leave that to them . They can ask the heir of the Hamleys fast enough when a county election is coming on . "
150673	150680	150682	150682	Osborne	230	" I tell you , sir , "
150698	150728	150730	150730	Osborne	230	" it is not me Lord Hollingford is inviting ; it is Roger . Roger is making himself known for what he is , a first - rate fellow , "
150745	150795	150797	150797	his	230	" and he 's getting himself a name ; he 's been writing about these new French theories and discoveries , and this foreign savant very naturally wants to make his acquaintance , and so Lord Hollingford asks him to dine . It 's as clear as can be , "
150806	150823	150802	150802	himself	230	" it has nothing to do with politics , if my father would but see it . "
150864	151127	151128	151128	He	4010	" You young men think you know everything . I tell you it 's a palpable Whig trick . And what business has Roger if it is Roger the man wants to go currying favour with the French ? In my day we were content to hate 'em and to lick 'em . But it 's just like your conceit , Osborne , setting yourself up to say it 's your younger brother they 're asking , and not you ; I tell you it 's you . They think the eldest son was sure to be called after his father , Roger Roger Hamley , junior . It 's as plain as a pike - staff . They know they ca n't catch me with chaff , but they 've got up this French dodge . What business had you to go writing about the French , Roger ? I should have thought you were too sensible to take any notice of their fancies and theories ; but if it is you they 've asked , I 'll not have you going and meeting these foreigners at a Whig house . They ought to have asked Osborne . He 's the representative of the Hamleys , if I 'm not ; and they ca n't get me , let 'em try ever so . Besides , Osborne has got a bit of the mounseer about him , which he caught with being so fond of going off to the Continent , instead of coming back to his good old English home . "
151182	151204	151174	151174	Osborne	230	" Of course you 'll go , Roger ? ten to one he 'll be in another mind to - morrow . "
151205	151208	151210	151210	Roger	203	" No , "
151220	151235	151210	151210	Roger	203	" I wo n't run the chance of vexing him . I shall refuse . "
151236	151244	151246	151246	Osborne	230	" Do n't be such a fool ! "
151248	151279	151246	151246	Osborne	230	" Really , my father is too unreasonable . You heard how he kept contradicting himself ; and such a man as you to be kept under like a child by "
151280	151293	151295	151295	Roger	203	" Do n't let us talk any more about it , Osborne , "
151348	151367	151311	151311	he	203	" How go the poems , old fellow ? I hope they 're nearly ready to bring out . "
151368	151411	151311	151311	he	203	" No , they 're not ; and if it were n't for the money , I should n't care if they were never published . What 's the use of fame , if one may n't reap the fruits of it ? "
151412	151511	151311	151311	he	203	" Come , now , we 'll have no more of that ; let 's talk about the money . I shall be going up for my Fellowship examination next week , and then we 'll have a purse in common , for they 'll never think of not giving me a Fellowship now I 'm senior wrangler . I 'm short enough myself at present , and I do n't like to bother my father ; but when I 'm Fellow , you shall take me down to Winchester , and introduce me to the little wife . "
151512	151525	151527	151527	Osborne	230	" It will be a month next Monday since I left her , "
151551	151582	151584	151584	he	230	" In her letter this morning she bids me give you such a pretty message . It wo n't bear translating into English ; you must read it for yourself , "
152682	152693	152695	152695	he	1206	" Thou'rt going to meet the mounseer , my lad ? "
152705	152737	152667	152668	The Squire	1206	" No , sir ; I sent off James almost immediately with a note declining it . I do n't care about it that 's to say , not to signify . "
152738	152750	152752	152753	his father	952	" Why did you take me up so sharp , Roger ? "
152756	152798	152752	152753	his father	952	" You all take me up so hastily now - a - days . I think it 's hard when a man must n't be allowed a bit of crossness when he 's tired and heavy at heart that I do . "
152799	152819	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" But , father , I should never like to go to a house where they had slighted you . "
152820	152827	152829	152830	the Squire	1206	" Nay , nay , lad , "
152837	152876	152829	152830	the Squire	1206	" I think I slighted them . They asked me to dinner , after my lord was made lieutenant , time after time , but I never would go near 'em . I call that my slighting them . "
152896	152928	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" I 've been making Jem try on his livery - coat that he has n't worn this three or four years , he 's got too stout for it now . "
152929	152960	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" Well , he need n't wear it , need he ? and Morgan 's lad will be glad enough of it , he 's sadly in want of clothes . "
152961	153013	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" Ay , ay ; but who 's to go with you when you call at the Towers ? It 's but polite to call after Lord What's - his - name has taken the trouble to come here ; and I should n't like you to go without a groom . "
153014	153066	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" My dear father ! I should n't know what to do with a man riding at my back . I can find my way to the stable - yard for myself , or there 'll be some man about to take my horse . Do n't trouble yourself about that . "
153067	153141	152890	152891	the Squire	1206	" Well , you 're not Osborne , to be sure . Perhaps it wo n't strike 'em as strange for you . But you must look up , and hold your own , and remember you 're one of the Hamleys , who 've been on the same land for hundreds of years , while they 're but trumpery Whig folk who only came into the county in Queen Anne 's time . "
153289	153323	153266	153266	She	189	" Ah ! Mr. Osborne , you should have been there ! I said to myself many a time how you really should have been there you and your brother , of course . "
153324	153335	153266	153266	She	189	" I thought of you very often during the evening ! "
153336	153363	153365	153365	Cynthia	247	" Did you ? Now that I call very kind of you . Cynthia , darling ! Do you hear what Mr. Osborne Hamley was saying ? "
153373	153386	153365	153365	Cynthia	247	" He thought of us all on the evening of the ball . "
153387	153397	153399	153399	Cynthia	247	" He did better than merely remember us then , "
153407	153419	153399	153399	Cynthia	247	" We owe him thanks for those beautiful flowers , mamma . "
153420	153423	153425	153425	Osborne	230	" Oh ! "
153427	153451	153425	153425	Osborne	230	" you must not thank me exclusively . I believe it was my thought , but Roger took all the trouble of it . "
153452	153460	153462	153463	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I consider the thought as everything , "
153465	153476	153462	153463	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Thought is spiritual , while action is merely material . "
153512	153529	153531	153531	Osborne	230	" I 'm afraid the flowers were too late to be of much use , though , "
153533	153562	153531	153531	Osborne	230	" I met Preston the next morning , and of course we talked about the ball . I was sorry to find he had been beforehand with us . "
153563	153576	153578	153578	Molly	147	" He only sent one nosegay , and that was for Cynthia , "
153586	153602	153578	153578	Molly	147	" And it did not come till after we had received the flowers from Hamley . "
153668	153732	153662	153663	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Mr. Preston 's bouquet was just one of those formal affairs any one can buy at a nursery - garden , which always strike me as having no sentiment in them . I would far rather have two or three lilies of the valley gathered for me by a person I like , than the most expensive bouquet that could be bought ! "
153733	153748	153750	153750	Cynthia	247	" Mr. Preston had no business to speak as if he had forestalled you , "
153752	153772	153750	153750	Cynthia	247	" It came just as we were ready to go , and I put it into the fire directly . "
153773	153780	153782	153783	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Cynthia , my dear love ! "
153797	153837	153782	153783	Mrs. Gibson	189	" what an idea of yourself you will give to Mr. Osborne Hamley ; but , to be sure , I can quite understand it . You inherit my feeling my prejudice sentimental I grant , against bought flowers . "
153849	153905	153846	153846	she	4086	" I used some of your flowers , Mr. Hamley , to dress Molly 's hair . It was a great temptation , for the colour so exactly matched her coral ornaments ; but I believe she thought it treacherous to disturb the arrangement , so I ought to take all the blame on myself . "
153906	153949	153950	153950	Osborne	230	" The arrangement was my brother 's , as I told you ; but I am sure he would have preferred seeing them in Miss Gibson 's hair rather than in the blazing fire . Mr. Preston comes far the worst off . "
153991	154001	153985	153985	she	147	" I wore mine just as they were sent , "
154014	154080	154083	154083	Osborne	230	" Speaking of lilies of the valley , is it true that they grow wild in Hurst Wood ? It is not the season for them to be in flower yet ; but when it is , I think we must take a walk there with our luncheon in a basket a little picnic in fact . You 'll join us , wo n't you ? "
154085	154135	154083	154083	Osborne	230	" I think it 's a charming plan ! You could ride to Hollingford and put up your horse here , and we could have a long day in the woods and all come home to dinner dinner with a basket of lilies in the middle of the table ! "
154136	154144	154146	154146	Osborne	230	" I should like it very much , "
154148	154175	154146	154146	Osborne	230	" but I may not be at home . Roger is more likely to be here , I believe , at that time a month hence . "
154229	154253	154375	154375	I	0	" Oh , but you must be with us ! We must wait for Mr. Osborne Hamley , must not we , Cynthia ? "
154254	154264	154266	154266	Cynthia	247	" I 'm afraid the lilies wo n't wait , "
154268	154309	154375	154375	I	0	" Well , then , we must put it off till dog - rose and honey - suckle time . You will be at home then , wo n't you ? or does the London season present too many attractions ? "
154310	154324	154375	154375	I	0	" I do n't exactly know when dog - roses are in flower ! "
154325	154339	154375	154375	I	0	" Not know , and you a poet ? Do n't you remember the lines
154354	154355	154347	154347	We	4088	" "
154414	154414	154400	154400	he	8074	"
154415	154429	154431	154431	Cynthia	247	" Does that fine word ' theoretical ' imply that you are ignorant ? "
154433	154494	154431	154431	Cynthia	247	" Of course we shall be happy to see your brother ; but why ca n't we have you too ? I confess to a little timidity in the presence of one so deep and learned as your brother is from all accounts . Give me a little charming ignorance , if we must call it by that hard word . "
155396	155403	155383	155384	Mrs. Gibson	189	" dancing with everybody who asked her "
155414	155417	155383	155384	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Red Book "
155572	155581	155583	155583	Cynthia	247	" If there is one thing I dislike , "
155602	155624	155625	155625	She	189	" it is the way doctors have of giving tablespoonfuls of nauseous mixtures as a certain remedy for sorrows and cares . "
155656	155709	155635	155635	she	189	" Come ! you acknowledge you have ' sorrows ' by that speech : we 'll make a bargain : if you 'll tell me your sorrows and cares , I 'll try and find some other remedy for them than giving you what you are pleased to term my nauseous mixtures . "
155710	155713	155715	155715	Cynthia	247	" No , "
155719	155751	155715	155715	Cynthia	247	" I never said I had sorrows and cares ; I spoke generally . What should I have a sorrow about ? you and Molly are only too kind to me , "
155758	155795	155635	155635	she	189	" Well , well , we 'll not talk of such gloomy things , and you shall have some sweet emulsion to disguise the taste of the bitters I shall be obliged to fall back upon . "
155796	155844	155845	155845	She	189	" Please , do n't . If you but knew how I dislike emulsions and disguises ! I do want bitters and if I sometimes if I 'm obliged to if I 'm not truthful myself , I do like truth in others at least , sometimes . "
155984	156028	155974	155975	some visitors	4129	" Molly , how ill your sister is looking ! What is it ? Has she had advice ? You must forgive me , but so often those who live together in the same house do n't observe the first approaches of illness . "
156116	156143	156240	156240	Roger	203	" Oh ! she was over - tired by the ball . Papa has seen her , and says she will be all right very soon . "
156144	156154	156156	156156	Roger	203	" I wonder if she wants change of air ? "
156160	156201	156156	156156	Roger	203	" I wish I do wish we could have her at the Hall ; you and your mother too , of course . But I do n't see how it would be possible or else how charming it would be ! "
156244	156306	156240	156240	Roger	203	" You got our flowers in time , did you not ? Ah ! you do n't know how often I thought of you that evening ! And you enjoyed it too , did n't you ? you had plenty of agreeable partners , and all that makes a first ball delightful ? I heard that your sister danced every dance . "
156307	156313	156315	156315	Molly	147	" It was very pleasant , "
156319	156351	156315	156315	Molly	147	" But , after all , I 'm not sure if I want to go to another just yet ; there seems to be so much trouble connected with a ball . "
156352	156368	156240	156240	Roger	203	" Ah ! you are thinking of your sister , and her not being well ? "
156369	156376	156378	156378	Molly	147	" No , I was not , "
156383	156402	156378	156378	Molly	147	" I was thinking of the dress , and the dressing , and the weariness the next day . "
156487	156514	156473	156473	he	4134	" Is there anything I could do for your sister ? We have plenty of books , as you know , if she cares for reading . "
156535	156561	156531	156531	he	4134	" Or flowers ? she likes flowers . Oh ! and our forced strawberries are just ready I will bring some over to - morrow . "
156562	156571	156573	156573	Molly	147	" I am sure she will like them , "

156838	156899	156826	156826	Roger	203	" Mr. Gibson and I should be so delighted if you could have stopped to dinner ; but , of course , we can not be so selfish as to ask you to stay when we remember how your father would be left alone . We were saying yesterday we wondered how he bore his solitude , poor old gentleman ! "

157424	157429	157448	157448	she	189	" Mr. Roger Hamley , "
157433	157437	157439	157440	Mrs. Gibson	189	" So tiresome ! "
157494	157498	157500	157500	he	188	" How delicious ! "
157502	157515	157500	157500	he	188	" No need for any more Hamley roses now yours are out . "
157516	157522	157524	157525	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I agree with you , "
157546	157573	157539	157539	he	188	" You have been very kind in bringing us flowers so long ; but now our own are out we need not trouble you any more . "
157692	157697	157699	157699	he	188	" At any rate , "
157701	157727	157699	157699	he	188	" my trouble if Mrs. Gibson considers it has been a trouble to me will be over - paid , if I may have this . "
157728	157734	157736	157736	Cynthia	365	" Old lamps for new , "
157746	157764	157736	157736	Cynthia	365	" I wish one could always buy nosegays such as you have brought us , as cheaply . "
157765	157786	157788	157789	her mother	552	" You forget the waste of time that , I think , we must reckon as part of the payment , "
157791	157886	157788	157789	her mother	552	" Really , Mr. Hamley , we must learn to shut our doors on you if you come so often , and at such early hours ! I settle myself to my own employment regularly after breakfast till lunch - time ; and it is my wish to keep Cynthia and Molly to a course of improving reading and study so desirable for young people of their age , if they are ever to become intelligent , companionable women ; but with early visitors it is quite impossible to observe any regularity of habits . "
157979	158051	157973	157973	he	203	" I believe I have been very thoughtless I 'll not come so early again ; but I had some excuse to - day : my brother told me you had made a plan for going to see Hurst Wood when the roses were out , and they are earlier than usual this year I 've been round to see . He spoke of a long day there , going before lunch "
158052	158071	158073	158074	Mrs. Gibson	189	" The plan was made with Mr. Osborne Hamley . I could not think of going without him ! "
158078	158151	157973	157973	he	203	" I had a letter from him this morning , in which he named your wish , and he says he fears he can not be at home till they are out of flower . I daresay they are not much to see in reality , but the day is so lovely I thought that the plan of going to Hurst Wood would be a charming excuse for being out of doors . "
158152	158182	157973	157973	he	203	" Thank you . How kind you are ! and so good , too , in sacrificing your natural desire to be with your father as much as possible . "
158183	158250	157973	157973	he	203	" I 'm glad to say my father is so much better than he was in the winter that he spends much of his time out of doors in his fields . He has been accustomed to go about alone , and I we think that as great a return to his former habits as he can be induced to make is the best for him . "
158251	158260	157973	157973	he	203	" And when do you return to Cambridge ? "
158273	158311	157973	157973	he	203	" It is uncertain . You probably know that I am a Fellow of Trinity now . I hardly yet know what my future plans may be ; I am thinking of going up to London soon . "
158312	158325	158327	158328	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ah ! London is the true place for a young man , "
158345	158402	158335	158335	she	189	" If it were not that we really are so busy this morning , I should have been tempted to make an exception to our general rule ; one more exception , for your early visits have made us make too many already . Perhaps , however , we may see you again before you go ? "
158403	158409	158411	158411	he	4153	" Certainly I shall come , "
158441	158464	158438	158438	he	4153	" My stay in London will not exceed a fortnight or so is there anything I can do for you or you ? "
158471	158479	158481	158481	Cynthia	365	" No , thank you very much , "
158511	158524	158495	158495	she	365	" You deserve these ; do throw that poor shabby bunch away . "
158548	158578	158579	158579	He	4153	" At any rate , I may come after lunch is over , and the afternoons and evenings will be the most delicious time of day a month hence . "
158621	158649	158613	158613	her	189	" I suppose we shall see you when you return ; and pray tell your brother how we are longing to have a visit from him again . "
158768	158782	158784	158785	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I ca n't think why he will come at such untimely hours , "
158799	158883	158784	158785	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It 's different from Osborne ; we are so much more intimate with him : he came and made friends with us all the time this stupid brother of his was muddling his brains with mathematics at Cambridge . Fellow of Trinity , indeed ! I wish he would learn to stay there , and not come intruding here , and assuming that because I asked Osborne to join in a picnic it was all the same to me which brother came . "
158884	158906	158908	158908	Cynthia	365	" In short , mamma , one man may steal a horse , but another must not look over the hedge , "
158914	158962	158964	158964	Molly	365	" And the two brothers have always been treated so exactly alike by their friends , and there has been such a strong friendship between them , that it is no wonder Roger thinks he may be welcome where Osborne is allowed to come at all hours , "
158970	158986	158964	158964	Molly	365	" Roger 's ' muddled brains , ' indeed ! Roger , ' stupid ! ' "
158987	159074	159091	159091	her	365	" Oh , very well , my dears ! When I was young it would n't have been thought becoming for girls of your age to fly out because a little restraint was exercised as to the hours at which they should receive the young men 's calls . And they would have supposed that there might be good reasons why their parents disapproved of the visits of certain gentlemen , even while they were proud and pleased to see some members of the same family . "
159075	159085	159087	159087	Cynthia	365	" But that was what I said , mamma , "
159103	159107	159087	159087	Cynthia	365	" One man may "
159108	159141	159091	159091	her	365	" Be quiet , child ! All proverbs are vulgar , and I do believe that is the vulgarest of all . You are really catching Roger Hamley 's coarseness , Cynthia ! "
159142	159145	159147	159147	Cynthia	365	" Mamma , "
159153	159224	159147	159147	Cynthia	365	" I do n't mind your abusing me , but Mr. Roger Hamley has been very kind to me while I 've not been well : I ca n't bear to hear him disparaged . If he 's coarse , I 've no objection to be coarse as well , for it seems to me it must mean kindliness and pleasantness , and the bringing of pretty flowers and presents . "
159253	159258	159235	159235	she	365	" making a scene , "
160020	160091	160004	160004	he	4174	" You mark my words , Roger . Five years hence the beautiful Cynthia 's red and white will have become just a little coarse , and her figure will have thickened , while Molly 's will only have developed into more perfect grace . I do n't believe the girl has done growing yet ; I 'm sure she 's taller than when I first saw her last summer . "
160092	160172	160004	160004	he	4174	" Miss Kirkpatrick 's eyes must always be perfection . I can not fancy any could come up to them : soft , grave , appealing , tender ; and such a heavenly colour I often try to find something in nature to compare them to ; they are not like violets that blue in the eyes is too like physical weakness of sight ; they are not like the sky that colour has something of cruelty in it . "
160173	160251	160004	160004	he	4174	" Come , do n't go on trying to match her eyes as if you were a draper , and they a bit of ribbon ; say at once ' her eyes are load - stars , ' and have done with it ! I set up Molly 's grey eyes and curling black lashes , long odds above the other young woman 's ; but , of course , it 's all a matter of taste . "
160469	160496	160462	160462	her	150	" It is such a thing for a man just setting up in practice for himself to be able to say he attends at this house ! "
161115	161146	161112	161112	he	1781	" Why , Osborne , is it you ? I thought it was an old man of fifty loitering before me ! I did n't know you had come back . "
161147	161156	161112	161112	he	1781	" Why , Osborne , Is It You ? "
161157	161166	161167	161167	Click	216	" Why , Osborne , Is It You ? "
161170	161173	161175	161175	Osborne	205	" Yes , "
161177	161256	161175	161175	Osborne	205	" I 've been at home nearly ten days . I daresay I ought to have called on your people , for I made a half promise to Mrs. Gibson to let her know as soon as I returned ; but the fact is , I 'm feeling very good - for - nothing , this air oppresses me ; I could hardly breathe in the house , and yet I 'm already tired with this short walk . "
161257	161281	161112	161112	he	1781	" You 'd better get home at once ; and I 'll call and see you as I come back from Rowe 's . "
161282	161292	161294	161294	Osborne	205	" No , you must n't on any account ! "
161298	161349	161350	161350	he	4224	" my father is annoyed enough about my going from home , so often , he says , though I had n't been from it for six weeks . He puts down all my languor to my having been away , he keeps the purse - strings , you know , "
161358	161418	161350	161350	he	4224	" and I 'm in the unlucky position of a penniless heir , and I 've been brought up so In fact , I must leave home from time to time , and , if my father gets confirmed in this notion of his that my health is worse for my absences , he 'll stop the supplies altogether . "
161419	161437	161439	161440	Mr. Gibson	238	" May I ask where you do spend your time when you are not at Hamley Hall ? "
161449	161452	161454	161454	Osborne	205	" No ! "
161458	161536	161454	161454	Osborne	205	" I will tell you this : I stay with friends in the country . I lead a life which ought to be conducive to health , because it is thoroughly simple , rational , and happy . And now I 've told you more about it than my father himself knows . He never asks me where I 've been ; and I should n't tell him if he did at least , I think not . "
161554	161666	161537	161538	Mr. Gibson	238	" Osborne , whatever scrapes you may have got into , I should advise your telling your father boldly out . I know him ; and I know he 'll be angry enough at first , but he 'll come round , take my word for it ; and , somehow or another , he 'll find money to pay your debts and set you free , if it 's that kind of difficulty ; and if it 's any other kind of entanglement , why still he 's your best friend . It 's this estrangement from your father that 's telling on your health , I 'll be bound . "
161667	161670	161672	161672	Osborne	205	" No , "
161674	161739	161672	161672	Osborne	205	" I beg your pardon ; but it 's not that ; I am really out of order . I daresay my unwillingness to encounter any displeasure from my father is the consequence of my indisposition ; but I 'll answer for it , it is not the cause of it . My instinct tells me there is something really the matter with me . "
161740	161754	161756	161757	Mr. Gibson	238	" Come , do n't be setting up your instinct against the profession , "
161797	161910	161794	161794	he	238	" We 'll soon bring you about , though I should like a little more quiet talk with you , without this tugging brute for a third . If you 'll manage to ride over and lunch with us to - morrow , Dr. Nicholls will be with us ; he 's coming over to see old Rowe ; and you shall have the benefit of the advice of two doctors instead of one . Go home now , you 've had enough exercise for the middle of a day as hot as this is . And do n't mope in the house , listening to the maunderings of your stupid instinct . "
161911	161919	161921	161921	Osborne	205	" What else have I to do ? "
161923	162005	161921	161921	Osborne	205	" My father and I are not companions ; one ca n't read and write for ever , especially when there 's no end to be gained by it . I do n't mind telling you but in confidence , recollect that I 've been trying to get some of my poems published ; but there 's no one like a publisher for taking the conceit out of one . Not a man among them would have them as a gift . "
162006	162140	162180	162181	Mr. Gibson	238	" Oho ! so that 's it , is it , Master Osborne ? I thought there was some mental cause for this depression of health . I would n't trouble my head about it , if I were you , though that 's always very easily said , I know . Try your hand at prose , if you ca n't manage to please the publishers with poetry ; but , at any rate , do n't go on fretting over spilt milk . But I must n't lose my time here . Come over to us to - morrow , as I said ; and what with the wisdom of two doctors , and the wit and folly of three women , I think we shall cheer you up a bit . "
162170	162178	162180	162181	Mr. Gibson	238	" I do n't like his looks , "
162199	162241	162191	162191	he	238	" And then his pulse . But how often we 're all mistaken ; and , ten to one , my own hidden enemy lies closer to me than his does to him even taking the worse view of the case . "
162708	162712	162702	162702	she	189	" that bear . "
162798	162860	162792	162792	her	365	" I hope you notice the difference in our occupations , Mr. Hamley . Molly , you see , devotes herself to the useful , and I to the ornamental . Please , under what head do you class what you are doing ? I think you might help one of us , instead of looking on like the Grand Seigneur . "
162861	162871	162873	162873	he	4245	" I do n't know what I can do , "
162878	162931	162873	162873	he	4245	" I should like to be useful , but I do n't know how ; and my day is past for purely ornamental work . You must let me be , I 'm afraid . Besides , I 'm really rather exhausted by being questioned and pulled about by those good doctors . "
162932	162949	162951	162951	Molly	365	" Why , you do n't mean to say they have been attacking you since lunch ! "
162953	162978	162792	162792	her	365	" Yes ; indeed , they have ; and they might have gone on till now if Mrs. Gibson had not come in opportunely . "
162979	162990	162992	162992	Cynthia	365	" I thought mamma had gone out some time ago ! "
163009	163039	163041	163041	Osborne	230	" She came into the dining - room not five minutes ago . Do you want her , for I see her crossing the hall at this very moment ? "
163045	163052	163054	163054	Cynthia	365	" Oh , not at all ! "
163056	163109	163054	163054	Cynthia	365	" Only she seemed to be in such a hurry to go out , I fancied she had set off long ago . She had some errand to do for Lady Cumnor , and she thought she could manage to catch the housekeeper , who is always in the town on Thursday . "
163110	163121	163041	163041	Osborne	230	" Are the family coming to the Towers this autumn ? "
163122	163148	163150	163150	Cynthia	365	" I believe so . But I do n't know , and I do n't much care . They do n't take kindly to me , "
163152	163168	163150	163150	Cynthia	365	" and so I suppose I 'm not generous enough to take kindly to them . "
163169	163193	163195	163195	Osborne	230	" I should have thought that such a very unusual blot in their discrimination would have interested you in them as extraordinary people , "
163205	163212	163214	163214	Cynthia	365	" Is n't that a compliment ? "
163223	163250	163214	163214	Cynthia	365	" If any one pays me a compliment , please let it be short and clear . I 'm very stupid at finding out hidden meanings . "
163251	163290	163150	163150	Cynthia	365	" Then such speeches as ' you are very pretty , ' or ' you have charming manners , ' are what you prefer . Now , I pique myself on wrapping up my sugar - plums delicately . "
163291	163310	163214	163214	Cynthia	365	" Then would you please to write them down , and at my leisure I 'll parse them . "
163311	163335	163150	163150	Cynthia	365	" No ! It would be too much trouble . I 'll meet you half - way , and study clearness next time . "
163336	163344	163346	163346	Molly	365	" What are you two talking about ? "
163354	163368	163370	163370	Cynthia	365	" It 's only a discussion on the best way of administering compliments , "
163391	163403	163405	163405	Molly	365	" I do n't like them at all in any way , "
163407	163420	163421	163421	she	365	" But , perhaps , it 's rather sour grapes with me , "
163424	163427	163429	163429	Osborne	230	" Nonsense ! "
163431	163445	163429	163429	Osborne	230	" Shall I tell you what I heard of you at the ball ? "
163446	163454	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" Or shall I provoke Mr. Preston , "
163458	163483	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" to begin upon you ? It 's like turning a tap , such a stream of pretty speeches flows out at the moment . "
163490	163496	163498	163498	Molly	365	" For you , perhaps , "
163500	163506	163498	163498	Molly	365	" but not for me . "
163507	163542	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" For any woman . It 's his notion of making himself agreeable . If you dare me , Molly , I 'll try the experiment , and you 'll see with what success . "
163543	163551	163553	163553	Molly	365	" No , do n't , pray ! "
163559	163566	163553	163553	Molly	365	" I do so dislike him ! "
163567	163570	163572	163572	Osborne	230	" Why ? "
163583	163601	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" Oh ! I do n't know . He never seems to know what one is feeling . "
163602	163612	163614	163614	Cynthia	365	" He would n't care if he did know , "
163616	163626	163614	163614	Cynthia	365	" And he might know he is not wanted . "
163627	163644	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" If he chooses to stay , he cares little whether he is wanted or not . "
163645	163653	163655	163655	Osborne	230	" Come , this is very interesting , "
163657	163677	163655	163655	Osborne	230	" It is like the strophe and anti - strophe in a Greek chorus . Pray , go on . "
163678	163685	163687	163687	Molly	365	" Do n't you know him ? "
163689	163726	163456	163456	Cynthia	247	" Yes , by sight , and I think we were once introduced . But , you know , we are much farther from Ashcombe , at Hamley , than you are here , at Hollingford . "
163727	163749	163751	163751	Molly	365	" Oh ! but he 's coming to take Mr. Sheepshanks ' place , and then he 'll live here altogether , "
163753	163761	163763	163763	Cynthia	365	" Molly ! who told you that ? "
163782	163831	163841	163841	she	365	" Papa , did n't you hear him ? Oh , no ! it was before you were down this morning . Papa met Mr. Sheepshanks yesterday , and he told him it was all settled : you know we heard a rumour about it in the spring ! "

164149	164165	164167	164167	she	365	" You 've been asleep you 've been dreaming . You 're over - tired , "
164230	164268	164354	164354	Cynthia	365	" Oh , how good you are , Molly ! I wonder , if I had been brought up like you , whether I should have been as good . But I 've been tossed about so . "
164269	164282	164284	164284	Molly	365	" Then , do n't go and be tossed about any more , "
164288	164333	164354	164354	Cynthia	365	" Oh , dear ! I had better go . But , you see , no one ever loved me like you , and , I think , your father does n't he , Molly ? And it 's hard to be driven out . "
164334	164353	164389	164389	she	365	" Cynthia , I am sure you 're not well , or else you 're not half awake . "

164396	164419	164389	164389	she	365	" I suppose there 's no escaping one 's doom ; and anywhere else I should be much more forlorn and unprotected . "

164430	164440	164442	164442	Cynthia	365	" Ah , that 's telling , little one , "
164454	164483	164442	164442	Cynthia	365	" I do n't mean to have one , though . I think that , though I am an arrant coward at heart , I can show fight . "

164552	164599	164601	164601	she	365	" ' With whom ? ' oh ! show fight with whom ? why , my doom , to be sure . Am not I a grand young lady to have a doom ? Why , Molly , child , how pale and grave you look ! "
164610	164648	164549	164549	she	365	" You ought not to care so much for me ; I 'm not good enough for you to worry yourself about me . I 've given myself up a long time ago as a heartless baggage ! "
164649	164662	164549	164549	she	365	" Nonsense ! I wish you would n't talk so , Cynthia ! "
164663	164769	164549	164549	she	365	" And I wish you would n't always take me ' at the foot of the letter , ' as an English girl at school used to translate it . Oh , how hot it is ! Is it never going to get cool again ? My child ! what dirty hands you 've got , and face too ; and I 've been kissing you I daresay I 'm dirty with it , too . Now , is n't that like one of mamma 's speeches ? But , for all that , you look more like a delving Adam than a spinning Eve . "
164877	164888	164890	164890	she	365	" What a fool ! what a fool I was ! "
164895	164916	164890	164890	she	365	" But even if I do n't go out as a governess , I shall make it up in time . "

164981	165008	164978	164979	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It is not kind of him not to come and see us as soon as he can . Tell him I say so pray do . "

165226	165283	165190	165190	her	189	" Not at all ; I call at all hours , and nothing is ever said about it . It was just because she was put out that morning . I 'll answer for it she 's sorry now , and I 'm sure you may go there at any time you like in the future . "

167233	167270	167222	167223	the Squire	1206	" Do n't talk of dying , we shall soon have you out , never fear . They 've sent you up some soup from the Hall , as I bade 'em , have n't they ? "
167271	167301	167180	167180	his	4339	" Ay , ay , I 've had all as I could want for to eat and to drink . The young squire and Master Roger was here yesterday . "
167302	167308	167222	167223	the Squire	1206	" Yes , I know . "
167309	167389	167400	167400	he	4342	" But I 'm a deal nearer Heaven to - day , I am . I should like you to look after th ' covers in th ' West Spinney , Squire ; them gorse , you know , where th ' old fox had her hole her as give 'em so many a run . You 'll mind it , Squire , though you was but a lad . I could laugh to think on her tricks yet . "
167581	167770	167797	167797	he	4352	" Them navvies I call 'em navvies because some on 'em is strangers , though some on 'em is th ' men as was turned off your own works , squire , when there came orders to stop 'em last fall they 're a - pulling up gorse and brush to light their fire for warming up their messes . It 's a long way off to their homes , and they mostly dine here ; and there 'll be nothing of a cover left , if you do n't see after 'em . I thought I should like to tell ye afore I died . Parson 's been here ; but I did na tell him . He 's all for the earl 's folk , and he 'd not ha ' heeded . It 's the earl as put him into his church , I reckon , for he said what a fine thing it were for to see so much employment a - given to the poor , and he never said nought o ' th ' sort when your works were agait , Squire . "
167821	167855	167814	167814	he	4352	" I know I flogged him well , I did . But he were after pheasants ' eggs , and I did n't know he were an orphan . Lord , forgive me ! "
167856	167875	167877	167878	the woman	8199	" He 's thinking on David Morton , the cripple , as used to go about trapping vermin , "
167880	167894	167896	167897	the Squire	1206	" Why , he died long ago twenty year , I should think , "
167899	167948	167949	167949	she	8199	" Ay , but when grandfather goes off i ' this way to sleep after a bout of talking he seems to be dreaming on old times . He 'll not waken up yet , sir ; you 'd best sit down if you 'd like to stay , "
167968	168018	167953	167953	she	8199	" He was very particular in bidding me wake him if he were asleep , and you or Mr. Roger was to call . Mr. Roger said he 'd be coming again this morning but he 'll likely sleep an hour or more , if he 's let alone . "
168019	168037	168094	168094	her	8199	" I wish I 'd said good - by , I should like to have done that . "
168038	168045	168047	168048	the woman	8199	" He drops off so sudden , "
168050	168073	168047	168048	the woman	8199	" But if you 'd be better pleased to have said it , Squire , I 'll waken him up a bit . "
168074	168079	168080	168081	the Squire	1206	" No , no ! "
168097	168164	168080	168081	the Squire	1206	" I 'll come again , perhaps to - morrow . And tell him I was sorry ; for I am indeed . And be sure and send to the Hall for anything you want ! Mr. Roger is coming , is he ? He 'll bring me word how he is , later on . I should like to have bidden him good - by . "
168538	168554	168533	168533	he	1206	" I beg your pardon , I suppose you are the manager of these works ? "
168559	168597	168555	168556	Mr. Preston	247	" Certainly . I am that and many other things besides , at your service . I have succeeded Mr. Sheepshanks in the management of my lord 's property . Mr. Hamley of Hamley , I believe ? "
168654	168663	168636	168636	himself	1206	" That was the Squire 's code of etiquette .
168664	168712	168636	168636	himself	1206	" I am Mr. Hamley of Hamley . I suppose you are as yet ignorant of the boundary of Lord Cumnor 's land , and so I will inform you that my property begins at the pond yonder just where you see the rise in the ground . "
168713	168725	168727	168728	Mr. Preston	247	" I am perfectly acquainted with that fact , Mr. Hamley , "
168740	168755	168727	168728	Mr. Preston	247	" But may I inquire why my attention is called to it just now ? "
168839	168872	168889	168889	his	247	" I have been told that your men out yonder do not respect these boundaries , but are in the habit of plucking up gorse from my covers to light their fires . "
168873	168880	168882	168883	Mr. Preston	247	" It is possible they may ! "
168898	168915	168886	168886	his	247	" I daresay they think no great harm of it . However , I 'll inquire . "
168916	168925	168927	168928	the Squire	1206	" Do you doubt my word , sir ? "
168940	168956	168927	168928	the Squire	1206	" I tell you I 've heard it only within this last half - hour . "
168957	169031	168886	168886	his	247	" I do n't mean to doubt your word , Mr. Hamley ; it 's the last thing I should think of doing . But you must excuse my saying that the argument which you have twice brought up for the authenticity of your statement , ' that you have heard it within the last half - hour , ' is not quite so forcible as to preclude the possibility of a mistake . "
169032	169048	169050	169051	the Squire	1206	" I wish you 'd only say in plain language that you doubt my word , "
169060	169075	169050	169051	the Squire	1206	" I ca n't make out what you mean you use so many words . "
169076	169211	169212	169212	He	4386	" Pray do n't lose your temper , sir . I said I should inquire . You have not seen the men pulling up gorse yourself , or you would have named it . I , surely , may doubt the correctness of your information until I have made some inquiry ; at any rate , that is the course I shall pursue , and if it gives you offence , I shall be sorry , but I shall do it just the same . When I am convinced that harm has been done to your property , I shall take steps to prevent it for the future , and of course , in my lord 's name , I shall pay you compensation it may probably amount to half - a - crown . "
169236	169243	169251	169251	he	4386	" Quiet , mare , quiet , "
169345	169384	169386	169387	the squire	1206	" I do n't know who you are , but I 've known land - agents who were gentlemen , and I 've known some who were not . You belong to this last set , young man , "
169389	169407	169386	169387	the squire	1206	" that you do . I should like to try my horsewhip on you for your insolence . "
169408	169414	169416	169417	Mr. Preston	247	" Pray , Mr. Hamley , "
169421	169447	169416	169417	Mr. Preston	247	" curb your temper a little , and reflect . I really feel sorry to see a man of your age in such a passion : "
169524	169573	169519	169519	he	203	" Mr. Preston , I can hardly understand what you mean by your last words . But , remember , my father is a gentleman of age and position , and not accustomed to receive advice as to the management of his temper from young men like you . "
169589	169601	169603	169604	the Squire	1206	" I desired him to keep his men off my land , "
169656	169665	169666	169667	Mr. Preston	247	" He refused , and doubted my word . "
169705	169717	169731	169731	his	203	" Your father has misunderstood me perhaps it is no wonder , "
169744	169776	169779	169779	he	203	" I never refused to do what was just and right . I only required further evidence as to the past wrong - doing ; your father took offence at this , "
169798	169852	169779	169779	he	203	" At any rate , sir ! I can scarcely reconcile the manner and words to my father , which I heard you use when I first came up , with the deference you ought to have shown to a man of his age and position . As to the fact of the trespass "
169853	169873	169876	169877	the Squire	1206	" They are pulling up all the gorse , Roger there 'll be no cover whatever for game soon , "
169900	169962	169964	169964	he	203	" I will inquire into it myself at a cooler moment ; and if I find that such trespass or damage has been committed , of course I shall expect that you will see it put a stop to . Come , father ! I am going to see old Silas perhaps you do n't know that he is very ill . "
170010	170059	169982	169983	Mr. Preston	247	" Position , indeed ! What are we to think of the position of a man who begins works like these without counting the cost , and comes to a stand - still , and has to turn off his labourers just at the beginning of winter , leaving "
170170	170196	170153	170154	Mr. Hamley	203	" Damn it , Roger ! I 'm not a child ; I wo n't be treated as such . Leave go , I say ! "
170250	170530	170531	170531	He	4411	" I know I turned them off what could I do ? I 'd no more money for their weekly wages ; it 's a loss to me , as you know . He does n't know , no one knows , but I think your mother would , how it cut me to turn 'em off just before winter set in . I lay awake many a night thinking of it , and I gave them what I had I did , indeed . I had n't got money to pay 'em , but I had three barren cows fattened , and gave every scrap of meat to the men , and I let 'em go into the woods and gather what was fallen , and I winked at their breaking off old branches , and now to have it cast up against me by that cur that servant . But I 'll go on with the works , by , I will , if only to spite him . I 'll show him who I am . My position , indeed ! A Hamley of Hamley takes a higher position than his master . I 'll go on with the works , see if I do n't ! I 'm paying between one and two hundred a year interest on Government money . I 'll raise some more if I go to the Jews ; Osborne has shown me the way , and Osborne shall pay for it he shall . I 'll not put up with insults . You should n't have stopped me , Roger ! I wish to heaven I 'd horsewhipped the fellow ! "

Yet now he was sure of a welcome , let him come at any hour he would . He was playfully reproved for having taken Mrs. Gibson 's words too literally , and for never coming before lunch . But he said he considered her reasons for such words to be valid , and should respect them . And this was done out of his simplicity , and from no tinge of malice . Then in their family conversations at home , Mrs. Gibson was constantly making projects for throwing Roger and Cynthia together , with so evident a betrayal of her wish to bring about an engagement , that Molly chafed at the net spread so evidently , and at Roger 's blindness in coming so willingly to be entrapped . She forgot his previous willingness , his former evidences of manly fondness for the beautiful Cynthia ; she only saw plots of which he was the victim , and Cynthia the conscious if passive bait . She felt as if she could not have acted as Cynthia did ; no , not even to gain Roger 's love . Cynthia heard and saw as much of the domestic background as she did , and yet she submitted to the rŰle assigned to her ! To be sure , this rŰle would have been played by her unconsciously ; the things prescribed were what she would naturally have done ; but because they were prescribed by implication only , it is true Molly would have resisted ; have gone out , for instance , when she was expected to stay at home ; or have lingered in the garden when a long country walk was planned . At last for she could not help loving Cynthia , come what would she determined to believe that Cynthia was entirely unaware of all ; but it was with an effort that she brought herself to believe it .

I 'm so tied up I ca n't cut down a stick more , and that 's a ' consequence ' of having the property so deucedly well settled ; I wish I 'd never had any ancestors . Ay , laugh , lad ! it does me good to see thee laugh a bit , after Osborne 's long face , which always grows longer at sight o ' me ! "
174387	174393	174395	174395	Roger	203	" Look here , father ! "
174399	174440	174395	174395	Roger	203	" I 'll manage somehow about the money for the works . You trust to me ; give me two months to turn myself in , and you shall have some money , at any rate , to begin with . "
174486	174500	174483	174483	he	203	" But how will you get it ? It 's hard enough work . "
174501	174578	174483	174483	he	203	" Never mind ; I 'll get it a hundred or so at first I do n't yet know how but remember , father , I 'm a senior wrangler , and a ' ve ry promising young writer , ' as that review called me . Oh , you do n't know what a fine fellow you 've got for a son ! You should have read that review to know all my wonderful merits . "
174579	174631	174483	174483	he	203	" I did , Roger . I heard Gibson speaking of it , and I made him get it for me . I should have understood it better if they could have called the animals by their English names , and not put so much of their French jingo into it . "
174632	174646	174648	174648	Roger	203	" But it was an answer to an article by a French writer , "
174650	174659	174661	174662	the Squire	1206	" I 'd ha ' let him alone ! "
174666	174834	174661	174662	the Squire	1206	" We had to beat 'em , and we did it at Waterloo ; but I 'd not demean myself by answering any of their lies , if I was you . But I got through the review , for all their Latin and French I did ; and if you doubt me , you just look at the end of the great ledger , turn it upside down , and you 'll find I 've copied out all the fine words they said of you : ' careful observer , ' ' strong nervous English , ' ' rising philosopher . ' Oh ! I can nearly say it all off by heart , for many a time when I 'm frabbed by bad debts , or Osborne 's bills , or moidered with accounts , I turn the ledger wrong way up , and smoke a pipe over it , while I read those pieces out of the review which speak about you , lad ! "
175159	175181	175217	175218	a child	1037	" Roger Hamley , senior wrangler and Fellow of Trinity , to the highest bidder , no matter what honest employment , "
175188	175194	175217	175218	a child	1037	" any bidder at all . "
175226	175234	175242	175242	Osborne	205	" heirs male born in lawful wedlock . "
175237	175239	175242	175242	Osborne	205	" wedlock "
175379	175388	175374	175374	Gray	380	" Leave me , leave me to repose . "
175389	175401	175330	175330	Roger	203	" But do try and tell me how you managed it . "
175402	175410	175413	175413	Osborne	205	" How tiresome you are , Roger ! "
175415	175426	175330	175330	Roger	203	" Well , I daresay I am . Go on ! "
175427	175443	175330	175330	Roger	203	" I 've told you Morrison married us . You remember old Morrison at Trinity ? "
175444	175459	175330	175330	Roger	203	" Yes ; as good and blunder - headed a fellow as ever lived . "
175460	175525	175330	175330	Roger	203	" Well , he 's taken orders ; and the examination for priest 's orders fatigued him so much that he got his father to give him a hundred or two for a tour on the Continent . He meant to get to Rome , because he heard that there were such pleasant winters there . So he turned up at Metz in August . "
175526	175533	175330	175330	Roger	203	" I do n't see why . "
175534	175608	175330	175330	Roger	203	" No more did he . He never was great in geography , you know ; and somehow he thought that Metz , pronounced French fashion , must be on the road to Rome . Some one had told him so in fun . However , it was very well for me that I met with him there , for I was determined to be married , and that without loss of time . "
175609	175616	175330	175330	Roger	203	" But Aimťe is a Catholic ? "
175617	175642	175644	175644	Osborne	205	" That 's true ! but you see I am not . You do n't suppose I would do her any wrong , Roger ? "
175667	175727	175330	175330	Roger	203	" No ! I 'm sure you would not mean it ; but , you see , there 's a child coming , and this estate is entailed on ' heirs - male . ' Now , I want to know if the marriage is legal or not ? and it seems to me it 's a ticklish question . "
175728	175731	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" Oh ! "
175740	175914	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" if that 's all , I suppose you 're next heir - male , and I can trust you as I can myself . You know my marriage is bon fide in intention , and I believe it to be legal in fact . We went over to Strasbourg ; Aimťe picked up a friend a good middle - aged Frenchwoman who served half as bridesmaid , half as chaperone , and then we went before the mayor prťfet what do you call them ? I think Morrison rather enjoyed the spree . I signed all manner of papers in the prefecture ; I did not read them over , for fear lest I could not sign them conscientiously . It was the safest plan . Aimťe kept trembling so I thought she would faint ; and then we went off to the nearest English chaplaincy , Carlsruhe , and the chaplain was away , so Morrison easily got the loan of the chapel , and we were married the next day . "
175915	175925	175330	175330	Roger	203	" But surely some registration or certificate was necessary ? "
175926	175956	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" Morrison said he would undertake all those forms ; and he ought to know his own business . I know I tipped him pretty well for the job . "
175957	175964	175966	175966	Roger	203	" You must be married again , "
175972	175990	175966	175966	Roger	203	" and that before the child is born . Have you got a certificate of the marriage ? "
175991	176033	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" I daresay Morrison has got it somewhere . But I believe I 'm legally married according to the laws both of England and France ; I really do , old fellow . I 've got the prťfet 's papers somewhere . "
176034	176060	175966	175966	Roger	203	" Never mind ! you shall be married again in England . Aimťe goes to the Roman Catholic chapel at Prestham , does n't she ? "
176061	176080	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" Yes . She is so good I would n't disturb her in her religion for the world . "
176081	176103	176105	176105	Roger	203	" Then you shall be married both there and at the church of the parish in which she lives as well , "
176109	176129	176131	176131	Osborne	205	" It 's a great deal of trouble , unnecessary trouble , and unnecessary expense , I should say , "
176133	176200	176131	176131	Osborne	205	" Why ca n't you leave well alone ? Neither Aimťe nor I are of the sort of stuff to turn scoundrels and deny the legality of our marriage ; and if the child is a boy and my father dies , and I die , why I 'm sure you 'll do him justice , as sure as I am of myself , old fellow ! "
176201	176234	175733	175733	Osborne	205	" But if I die into the bargain ? Make a hecatomb of the present Hamleys all at once , while you are about it . Who succeeds as heir - male ? "
176241	176272	176235	176235	Osborne	205	" One of the Irish Hamleys , I suppose . I fancy they are needy chaps . Perhaps you 're right . But what need to have such gloomy forebodings ? "
176273	176284	176286	176286	Roger	203	" The law makes one have foresight in such affairs , "
176288	176327	176286	176286	Roger	203	" So I 'll go down to Aimťe next week when I 'm in town , and I 'll make all necessary arrangements before you come . I think you 'll be happier if it is all done . "
176328	176382	176286	176286	Roger	203	" I shall be happier if I 've a chance of seeing the little woman , that I grant you . But what is taking you up to town ? I wish I 'd money to run about like you , instead of being shut up for ever in this dull old house . "
176456	176459	176448	176448	he	4539	" Mea culpa "
176480	176490	176492	176492	Roger	203	" I should n't have thought of going up , "
176511	176567	176492	176492	Roger	203	" if I had n't had to go up on business . Lord Hollingford has written for me ; he knows my great wish for employment , and has heard of something which he considers suitable ; there 's his letter if you care to read it . But it does not tell anything definitely . "
176588	176633	176585	176585	he	4539	" Why do you want money ? Are we taking too much from you ? It 's a great shame of me ; but what can I do ? Only suggest a career for me , and I 'll follow it to - morrow . "
176644	176726	176634	176634	He	4539	" My dear fellow , do n't get those notions into your head ! I must do something for myself sometimes , and I 've been on the look - out . Besides , I want my father to go on with his drainage ; it would do good both to his health and his spirits . If I can advance any part of the money requisite , he and you shall pay me interest until you can return the capital . "
176727	176738	176740	176740	Osborne	205	" Roger , you 're the providence of the family , "
176799	176803	176805	176805	they	4545	" The family , "
177216	177266	177207	177207	Molly	365	" heart ; and she knew that Cynthia did not love Roger . Molly could have cried with passionate regret at the thought of the unvalued treasure lying at Cynthia 's feet ; and it would have been a merely unselfish regret . It was the old fervid tenderness : "
177286	177324	177279	177279	I	0	" Cynthia 's love was the moon Roger yearned for ; and Molly saw that it was far away and out of reach , else would she have strained her heart - cords to give it to Roger .
177325	177331	177332	177332	she	365	" I am his sister , "
177338	177395	177332	177332	she	365	" That old bond is not done away with , though he is too much absorbed by Cynthia to speak about it just now . His mother called me ' Fanny ; ' it was almost like an adoption . I must wait and watch , and see if I can do anything for my brother . "
177615	177713	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" Molly is gone out ; she will be so sorry to miss you , but she was obliged to go to see some old friends of her mother 's whom she ought not to neglect ; as I said to her , constancy is everything . It is Sterne , I think , who says , ' Thine own and thy mother 's friends forsake not . ' But , dear Lady Harriet , you 'll stop till she comes home , wo n't you ? I know how fond you are of her ; in fact "
177719	177735	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" I sometimes say you come more to see her than your poor old Clare . "
177743	177840	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" Lady Harriet is coming here this morning . I ca n't have any one else coming in . Tell Maria to say I 'm not at home . Lady Harriet has always so much to tell me . Dear Lady Harriet ! I 've known all her secrets since she was twelve years old . You two girls must keep out of the way . Of course she 'll ask for you , out of common civility ; but you would only interrupt us if you came in , as you did the other day ; "
177844	177860	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" I hardly like to say so , but I thought it was very forward . "
177861	177871	177874	177874	Molly	365	" Maria told me she had asked for me , "
177878	177883	177885	177886	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Very forward indeed ! "
177914	177969	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" I think this time I must secure her ladyship from the chances of such an intrusion , by taking care that you are out of the house , Molly . You had better go to the Holly Farm , and speak about those damsons I ordered , and which have never been sent . "
177970	177975	177977	177977	Cynthia	365	" I 'll go , "
177979	178041	177977	177977	Cynthia	365	" It 's far too long a walk for Molly ; she 's had a bad cold , and is n't as strong as she was a fortnight ago . I delight in long walks . If you want Molly out of the way , mamma , send her to the Miss Brownings ' they are always glad to see her . "
178042	178056	178058	178059	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I never said I wanted Molly out of the way , Cynthia , "
178061	178106	178058	178059	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You always put things in such an exaggerated I should almost say , so coarse a manner . I am sure , Molly , my love , you could never have so misunderstood me ; it is only on Lady Harriet 's account . "
178107	178133	177611	177612	Lady Harriet	168	" I do n't think I can walk as far as the Holly Farm ; papa would take the message ; Cynthia need not go . "
178134	178248	178058	178059	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Well ! I 'm the last person in the world to tax any one 's strength ; I 'd sooner never see damson preserve again . Suppose you do go and see Miss Browning ; you can pay her a nice long call , you know she likes that ; and ask after Miss Phobe 's cold from me , you know . They were friends of your mother 's , my dear , and I would not have you break off old friendships for the world . ' Constancy above everything ' is my motto , as you know , and the memory of the dead ought always to be cherished . "
178249	178260	178262	178262	Cynthia	365	" Now , mamma , where am I to go ? "
178264	178306	178262	178262	Cynthia	365	" Though Lady Harriet does n't care for me as much as she does for Molly indeed , quite the contrary I should say yet she might ask after me , and I had better be safely out of the way . "
178307	178310	178312	178313	Mrs. Gibson	189	" True ! "
178327	178530	178058	178059	Mrs. Gibson	189	" She is much less likely to ask for you , my dear : I almost think you might remain in the house , or you might go to the Holly Farm ; I really do want the damsons ; or you might stay here in the dining - room , you know , so as to be ready to arrange lunch prettily , if she does take a fancy to stay for it . She is very fanciful , is dear Lady Harriet ! I would not like her to think we made any difference in our meals because she stayed . ' Simple elegance , ' as I tell her , ' always is what we aim at . ' But still you could put out the best service , and arrange some flowers , and ask cook what there is for dinner that she could send us for lunch , and make it all look pretty , and impromptu , and natural . I think you had better stay at home , Cynthia , and then you could fetch Molly from Miss Brownings ' in the afternoon , you know , and you two could take a walk together . "
178531	178602	178629	178629	she	189	" After Lady Harriet was fairly gone ! I understand , mamma . Off with you , Molly . Make haste , or Lady Harriet may come and ask for you as well as mamma . I 'll take care and forget where you are going to , so that no one shall learn from me where you are , and I 'll answer for mamma 's loss of memory . "
178603	178620	178622	178623	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Child ! what nonsense you talk ; you quite confuse me with being so silly , "
178666	178726	178736	178736	she	365	" Molly , darling , there 's a very cold wind , though it looks so fine . You had better put on my Indian shawl ; and it will look so pretty , too , on your grey gown scarlet and grey ; it 's not everybody I would lend it to , but you 're so careful . "
178727	178731	178733	178733	Molly	365	" Thank you , "
178781	178783	178772	178772	she	168	" constancy "
178785	178789	178772	178772	she	168	" old friends , "
178856	178889	179402	179403	Lady Harriet	168	" That 's right , dear Lady Harriet ! you ca n't think what a pleasure it is to me to welcome you at my own fireside , into my humble home . "
178890	178950	179056	179056	she	995	" Humble ! now , Clare , that 's a little bit of nonsense , begging your pardon . I do n't call this pretty little drawing - room a bit of a ' humble home . ' It 's as full of comforts , and of pretty things too , as any room of its size can be . "
178951	178972	179402	179403	Lady Harriet	168	" Ah ! how small you must feel it ! even I had to reconcile myself to it at first . "
178973	179040	179056	179056	she	995	" Well ! perhaps your schoolroom was larger , but remember how bare it was , how empty of anything but deal tables , and forms , and mats . Oh , indeed , Clare , I quite agree with mamma , who always says you have done very well for yourself ; and Mr. Gibson too ! What an agreeable , well - informed man ! "
179041	179047	179056	179056	she	995	" Yes , he is , "
179072	179115	179056	179056	she	995	" He is very agreeable , very ; only we see so little of him ; and of course he comes home tired and hungry , and not inclined to talk to his own family , and apt to go to sleep . "
179116	179121	179123	179124	Lady Harriet	168	" Come , come ! "
179126	179180	179123	179124	Lady Harriet	168	" I 'm going to have my turn now . We 've had the complaint of a doctor 's wife , now hear the moans of a peer 's daughter . Our house is so overrun with visitors ! and literally to - day I have come to you for a little solitude . "
179181	179184	179186	179187	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Solitude ! "
179189	179196	179186	179187	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Would you rather be alone ? "
179200	179401	179123	179124	Lady Harriet	168	" No , you dear silly woman ; my solitude requires a listener , to whom I may say , ' How sweet is solitude ! ' But I am tired of the responsibility of entertaining . Papa is so open - hearted , he asks every friend he meets with to come and pay us a visit . Mamma is really a great invalid , but she does not choose to give up her reputation for good health , having always considered illness a want of self - control . So she gets wearied and worried by a crowd of people who are all of them open - mouthed for amusement of some kind ; just like a brood of fledglings in a nest ; so I have to be parent - bird , and pop morsels into their yellow leathery bills , to find them swallowed down before I can think of where to find the next . Oh , it 's ' entertaining ' in the largest , literalist , dreariest sense of the word . So I have told a few lies this morning , and come off here for quietness and the comfort of complaining ! "
179432	179437	179440	179440	she	189	" Poor Lady Harriet ! "
179453	179483	179447	179448	Lady Harriet	168	" I used to take you as my arbiter of morals when I was a little girl . Tell me , do you think it wrong to tell lies ? "
179484	179529	179414	179415	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , my dear ! how can you ask such questions ? of course it is very wrong , very wicked indeed , I think I may say . But I know you were only joking when you said you had told lies . "
179530	179632	179447	179448	Lady Harriet	168	" No , indeed , I was n't . I told as plump fat lies as you would wish to hear . I said I ' was obliged to go into Hollingford on business , ' when the truth was there was no obligation in the matter , only an insupportable desire of being free from my visitors for an hour or two , and my only business was to come here , and yawn , and complain , and lounge at my leisure . I really think I 'm unhappy at having told a story , as children express it . "
179633	179641	179643	179644	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But , my dear Lady Harriet , "
179664	179682	179643	179644	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am sure you thought that you meant what you said , when you said it . "
179683	179690	179693	179694	Lady Harriet	168	" No , I did n't , "
179696	179744	179447	179448	Lady Harriet	168	" And besides , if you did n't , it was the fault of the tiresome people who drove you into such straits yes , it was certainly their fault , not yours and then you know the conventions of society ah , what trammels they are ! "
179759	179775	179756	179756	she	168	" Tell me , Clare ; you 've told lies sometimes , have n't you ? "
179776	179800	179756	179756	she	168	" Lady Harriet ! I think you might have known me better ; but I know you do n't mean it , dear . "
179801	179825	179756	179756	she	168	" Yes , I do . You must have told white lies , at any rate . How did you feel after them ? "
179826	179911	179756	179756	she	168	" I should have been miserable if I ever had . I should have died of self - reproach . ' The truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , ' has always seemed to me such a fine passage . But then I have so much that is unbending in my nature , and in our sphere of life there are so few temptations . If we are humble , we are also simple , and unshackled by etiquette . "
179912	179939	179756	179756	she	168	" Then you blame me very much ? If somebody else will blame me , I sha'n't be so unhappy at what I said this morning . "
179940	179971	179756	179756	she	168	" I am sure I never blamed you , not in my innermost heart , dear Lady Harriet . Blame you , indeed ! That would be presumption in me . "
179972	180001	179756	179756	she	168	" I think I shall set up a confessor ! and it sha'n't be you , Clare , for you have always been only too indulgent to me . "
180008	180048	180005	180005	she	4584	" Can you give me some lunch , Clare ? I do n't mean to go home till three . My ' business ' will take me till then , as the people at the Towers are duly informed . "
180049	180068	180005	180005	she	4584	" Certainly . I shall be delighted ! but you know we are very simple in our habits . "
180069	180115	180005	180005	she	4584	" Oh , I only want a little bread - and - butter , and perhaps a slice of cold meat you must not give yourself any trouble , Clare perhaps you dine now ? let me sit down just like one of your family . "
180116	180179	180005	180005	she	4584	" Yes , you shall ; I wo n't make any alteration ; it will be so pleasant to have you sharing our family meal , dear Lady Harriet . But we dine late , we only lunch now . How low the fire is getting ; I really am forgetting everything in the pleasure of this tete - a - tete ! "
180214	180218	180181	180181	she	4585	" Hall of Apollo "
180401	180411	180412	180412	she	168	" Lord Hollingford ought to have been with us , "
180419	180446	180412	180412	she	168	" but he is obliged , or fancies himself obliged , which is all the same thing , to stay in town about this Crichton legacy ! "
180447	180460	180834	180834	her	365	" A legacy ? To Lord Hollingford ? I am so glad ! "
180461	180602	180412	180412	she	168	" Do n't be in a hurry to be glad ! It 's nothing for him but trouble . Did n't you hear of that rich eccentric Mr. Crichton , who died some time ago , and fired by the example of Lord Bridgewater , I suppose left a sum of money in the hands of trustees , of whom my brother is one , to send out a man with a thousand fine qualifications , to make a scientific voyage , with a view to bringing back specimens of the fauna of distant lands , and so forming the nucleus of a museum which is to be called the Crichton Museum , and so perpetuate the founder 's name . Such various forms does man 's vanity take ! Sometimes it stimulates philanthropy ; sometimes a love of science ! "
180603	180619	180621	180622	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It seems to me a very laudable and useful object , I am sure , "
180626	180822	180412	180412	she	168	" I daresay it is , taking it from the public - good view . But it 's rather tiresome to us privately , for it keeps Hollingford in town or between it and Cambridge and each place as dull and empty as can be , just when we want him down at the Towers . The thing ought to have been decided long ago , and there 's some danger of the legacy lapsing . The two other trustees have run away to the Continent , feeling , as they say , the utmost confidence in him , but in reality shirking their responsibilities . However , I believe he likes it , so I ought not to grumble . He thinks he is going to be very successful in the choice of his man and he belongs to this county , too , young Hamley of Hamley , if he can only get his college to let him go , for he is a Fellow of Trinity , senior wrangler or something ; and they 're not so foolish as to send their crack man to be eaten up by lions and tigers ! "
180823	180830	180832	180832	Cynthia	365	" It must be Roger Hamley ! "
180843	180860	180862	180863	Mrs. Gibson	189	" He 's not the eldest son ; he can scarcely be called Hamley of Hamley ! "
180865	180880	180412	180412	she	168	" Hollingford 's man is a Fellow of Trinity , as I said before . "
180881	180889	180891	180891	Cynthia	365	" Then it is Mr. Roger Hamley , "
180893	180913	180891	180891	Cynthia	365	" and he 's up in London about some business ! What news for Molly when she comes home ! "
180914	180925	180927	180928	Lady Harriet	168	" Why , what has Molly to do with it ? "
180930	180933	180935	180935	she	168	" Is ? "
180967	180976	180978	180979	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , no ! not at all , "
180993	181000	180978	180979	Mrs. Gibson	189	" If any one , that . "
181062	181091	181058	181059	Lady Harriet	168	" And where is Molly all this time ? I should like to see my little mentor . I hear she is very much grown since those days . "
181092	181113	181115	181116	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh ! when she once gets gossiping with the Miss Brownings , she never knows when to come home , "
181118	181193	181058	181059	Lady Harriet	168	" The Miss Brownings ? Oh ! I 'm so glad you named them ! I 'm very fond of them . Pecksy and Flapsy ; I may call them so in Molly 's absence . I 'll go and see them before I go home , and then perhaps I shall see my dear little Molly too . Do you know , Clare , I 've quite taken a fancy to that girl ! "
181227	181231	181233	181234	Mrs. Gibson	189	" make herself common "
181656	181666	181668	181669	Mr. Gibson	238	" Roger Hamley going off on a scientific expedition ! "
181676	181711	181637	181637	she	189	" Yes . At least it is not settled finally ; but as Lord Hollingford is the only trustee who takes any interest and being Lord Cumnor 's son it is next to certain . "
181712	181724	181726	181727	Mr. Gibson	238	" I think I must have a voice in the matter , "
181744	181752	181754	181754	Cynthia	365	" How long will he be away ? "
181756	181763	181754	181754	Cynthia	365	" We shall miss him sadly . "
181770	181772	181764	181764	Molly	365	" yes "
182128	182130	182120	182121	Mr. Gibson	238	" yes "
182394	182429	182431	182431	he	1206	" That 's capital , Gibson ! what good wind blew you here ? You 'll have some lunch ? it 's on the table , I only just this minute left the room . "
182459	182468	182470	182471	Mr. Gibson	238	" What 's this I hear about Roger ? "
182480	182631	182654	182654	he	4621	" Aha ! so you 've heard , have you ? It 's famous , is n't it ? He 's a boy to be proud of , is old Roger . Steady Roger ; we used to think him slow , but it seems to me that slow and sure wins the race . But tell me ; what have you heard ? how much is known ? Nay , you must have a glass full . It 's old ale , such as we do n't brew now - a - days ; it 's as old as Osborne . We brewed it that autumn , and we called it the young squire 's ale . I thought to have tapped it on his marriage , but I do n't know when that will come to pass , so we 've tapped it now in Roger 's honour . "
182657	182663	182654	182654	he	4621	" as strong as brandy , "
182681	182713	182654	182654	he	4621	" Well ! and what have you heard ? There 's a deal to hear , and all good news , though I shall miss the lad , I know that . "
182714	182732	182654	182654	he	4621	" I did not know it was settled ; I only heard that it was in progress . "
182733	182798	182818	182818	he	238	" Well , it was only in progress , as you call it , till last Tuesday . He never let me know anything about it , though ; he says he thought I might be fidgety with thinking of the pros and cons . So I never knew a word on't till I had a letter from my Lord Hollingford where is it ? "
182824	182863	182818	182818	he	238	" ' Measurement of timber , new railings , ' ' drench for cows , from Farmer Hayes , ' ' Dobson 's accounts , ' ' um ' um here it is . Now read that letter , "
183170	183236	183161	183161	he	238	" Ay ! you 've come to it at last . It 's the best part of the whole , is n't it ? God bless the boy ! and from a Whig , mind you , which makes it the more handsome . And there 's more to come still . I say , Gibson , I think my luck is turning at last , "
183246	183291	183167	183167	he	238	" That only came this morning ; but I 've acted on it already , I sent for the foreman of the drainage works at once , I did ; and to - morrow , please God , they 'll be at work again . "
183529	183545	183526	183526	he	238	" He 'll have to pay a pretty sum for insuring his life beyond seas . "
183546	183554	183556	183557	the Squire	1206	" He 's got his Fellowship money , "
183568	183587	183526	183526	he	238	" Yes ; that 's true . And he 's a strong young fellow , as I know . "
183588	183597	183599	183600	the Squire	1206	" I wish I could tell his mother , "
183606	183613	183615	183616	Mr. Gibson	238	" It seems all settled now , "
183632	183635	183637	183638	the Squire	1206	" Yes ! "
183640	183691	183637	183638	the Squire	1206	" and they 're not going to let the grass grow under his feet . He 's to be off as soon as he can get his scientific traps ready . I almost wish he was n't to go . You do n't seem quite to like it , doctor ? "
183692	183698	183700	183701	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , I do , "
183710	183722	183724	183724	he	238	" It ca n't be helped now without doing a mischief , "
183728	183792	183724	183724	he	238	" Why , Squire , I think it a great honour to have such a son . I envy you , that 's what I do . Here 's a lad of three or four and twenty distinguishing himself in more ways than one , and as simple and affectionate at home as any fellow need to be not a bit set up . "
183793	183828	183637	183638	the Squire	1206	" Ay , ay ; he 's twice as much a son to me as Osborne , who has been all his life set up on nothing at all , as one may say . "
183829	184042	183724	183724	he	238	" Come , Squire , I must n't hear anything against Osborne ; we may praise one , without hitting at the other . Osborne has n't had the strong health which has enabled Roger to work as he has done . I met a man who knew his tutor at Trinity the other day , and of course we began cracking about Roger it 's not every day that one can reckon a senior wrangler amongst one 's friends , and I 'm nearly as proud of the lad as you are . This Mr. Mason told me the tutor said that only half of Roger 's success was owing to his mental powers ; the other half was owing to his perfect health , which enabled him to work harder and more continuously than most men without suffering . He said that in all his experience he had never known any one with an equal capacity for mental labour ; and that he could come again with a fresh appetite to his studies after shorter intervals of rest than most . Now I , being a doctor , trace a good deal of his superiority to the material cause of a thoroughly good constitution , which Osborne has n't got . "
184043	184057	184059	184060	the Squire	1206	" Osborne might have , if he got out o ' doors more , "
184064	184086	184087	184087	he	1206	" but except when he can loaf into Hollingford he does n't care to go out at all . I hope , "
184100	184161	184087	184087	he	1206	" he 's not after one of your girls ? I do n't mean any offence , you know ; but he 'll have the estate , and it wo n't be free , and he must marry money . I do n't think I could allow it in Roger ; but Osborne 's the eldest son , you know . "
184203	184254	184196	184196	he	238	" I do n't believe there 's anything of the kind going on . I 'm not much at home , you know ; but I 've never heard or seen anything that should make me suppose that there is . When I do , I 'll let you know . "
184255	184386	184162	184163	Mr. Gibson	238	" Now , Gibson , do n't go and be offended . I 'm glad for the boys to have a pleasant house to go to , and I thank you and Mrs. Gibson for making it pleasant . Only keep off love ; it can come to no good . That 's all . I do n't believe Osborne will ever earn a farthing to keep a wife during my life , and if I were to die to - morrow , she would have to bring some money to clear the estate . And if I do speak as I should n't have done formerly a little sharp or so why , it 's because I 've been worried by many a care no one knows anything of . "
184387	184396	184398	184399	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 'm not going to take offence , "
184401	184548	184398	184399	Mr. Gibson	238	" but let us understand each other clearly . If you do n't want your sons to come as much to my house as they do , tell them so yourself . I like the lads , and am glad to see them ; but if they do come , you must take the consequences , whatever they are , and not blame me , or them either , for what may happen from the frequent intercourse between two young men and two young women ; and what is more , though , as I said , I see nothing whatever of the kind you fear at present , and have promised to tell you of the first symptoms I do see , yet farther than that I wo n't go . If there 's an attachment at any future time , I wo n't interfere . "
184549	184591	184593	184594	the Squire	1206	" I should n't so much mind if Roger fell in love with your Molly . He can fight for himself , you see , and she 's an uncommon nice girl . My poor wife was so fond of her , "
184596	184608	184593	184594	the Squire	1206	" It 's Osborne and the estate I 'm thinking of ! "
184609	184633	184398	184399	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , then , tell him not to come near us . I shall be sorry , but you will be safe . "
184634	184666	184593	184594	the Squire	1206	" I 'll think about it ; but he 's difficult to manage . I 've always to get my blood well up before I can speak my mind to him . "
184690	184796	184678	184678	he	238	" Take my advice , Squire . As I said , there 's no harm done as yet , as far as I know . Prevention is better than cure . Speak out , but speak gently to Osborne , and do it at once . I shall understand how it is if he does n't show his face for some months in my house . If you speak gently to him , he 'll take the advice as from a friend . If he can assure you there 's no danger , of course he 'll come just as usual , when he likes . "
186153	186165	186198	186199	Mrs. Gibson	189	" her pretty lips with blackberries were all besmeared and dyed , "
186311	186398	186303	186304	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 've been watching for you , dear . Do n't go upstairs into the drawing - room , love . It might be a little interruption just now . Roger Hamley is there with Cynthia ; and I 've reason to think in fact I did open the door unawares , but I shut it again softly , and I do n't think they heard me . Is n't it charming ? Young love , you know , ah , how sweet it is ! "
186399	186410	186412	186412	Molly	365	" Do you mean that Roger has proposed to Cynthia ? "
186414	186507	186303	186304	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Not exactly that . But I do n't know ; of course I know nothing . Only I did hear him say that he had meant to leave England without speaking of his love , but that the temptation of seeing her alone had been too great for him . It was symptomatic , was it not , my dear ? And all I wanted was to let it come to a crisis without interruption . So I 've been watching for you to prevent your going in and disturbing them . "
186508	186522	186524	186524	Molly	365	" But I may go to my own room , may n't I , "
186526	186530	186532	186533	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Of course , "
186539	186553	186532	186533	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Only I had expected sympathy from you at such an interesting moment . "
187078	187099	187101	187101	she	365	" Molly ! Mr. Roger Hamley is here , and wants to wish you good - by before he goes . "
187209	187254	187205	187205	Roger	203	" I could never forgive myself if I had accepted a pledge from her . She shall be free until my return ; but the hope , the words , her sweet goodness , have made me happy beyond description . Oh , Molly ! "
187276	187336	187205	187205	Roger	203	" I think you have long guessed my secret , have you not ? I once thought of speaking to you before I left , and confiding it all to you . But the temptation has been too great , I have told Cynthia how fondly I love her , as far as words can tell ; and she says "
187385	187408	187379	187380	her mother	552	" My dear sweet girl values your love as it ought to be valued , I am sure . And I believe , "
187418	187434	187379	187380	her mother	552	" I could tell tales as to the cause of her indisposition in the spring . "
187435	187438	187440	187440	Cynthia	365	" Mother , "
187443	187474	187440	187440	Cynthia	365	" you know it was no such thing . Pray do n't invent stories about me . I have engaged myself to Mr. Roger Hamley , and that is enough . "
187475	187482	187484	187484	Roger	203	" Enough ! more than enough ! "
187486	187537	187484	187484	Roger	203	" I will not accept your pledge . I am bound , but you are free . I like to feel bound , it makes me happy and at peace , but with all the chances involved in the next two years , you must not shackle yourself by promises . "
187562	187582	187555	187556	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You are very generous , I am sure . Perhaps it will be better not to mention it . "
187583	187594	187596	187596	Cynthia	365	" I would much rather have it kept a secret , "
187600	187719	187555	187556	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Certainly , my dear love . That was just what I was going to say . I once knew a young lady who heard of the death of a young man in America , whom she had known pretty well ; and she immediately said she had been engaged to him , and even went so far as to put on weeds ; and it was a false report , for he came back well and merry , and declared to everybody he had never so much as thought about her . So it was very awkward for her . These things had much better be kept secret until the proper time has come for divulging them . "
187733	187755	187724	187724	Cynthia	365	" Mamma , I will promise you I wo n't put on weeds , whatever reports come of Mr. Roger Hamley . "
187756	187761	187762	187762	he	4727	" Roger , please ! "
187771	187848	187762	187762	he	4727	" And you will all be witnesses that he has professed to think of me , if he is tempted afterwards to deny the fact . But at the same time I wish it to be kept a secret until his return and I am sure you will all be so kind as to attend to my wish . Please , Roger ! Please , Molly ! Mamma , I must especially beg it of you ! "
187908	187931	187902	187903	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear child ! why ' especially ' to poor me ? You know I 'm the most trustworthy person alive ! "
187946	187951	187953	187953	Roger	203	" I must go ! "
187958	187994	187995	187995	he	203	" I had no idea it was so late . I shall write from Paris . The coach will be at the George by this time , and will only stay five minutes . Dearest Cynthia "
188019	188026	188028	188028	he	203	" Only remember you are free ! "
188041	188049	188051	188051	Cynthia	398	" If I had considered myself free , "
188066	188083	188051	188051	Cynthia	398	" if I had thought myself free , do you think I would have allowed that ? "
188107	188131	188132	188132	His	203	" Molly ! you wo n't forget me , I know ; I shall never forget you , nor your goodness to her . "
188329	188342	188343	188343	she	365	" I must see him again ; I must ! I must ! "
188598	188606	188590	188590	she	365	" May I come in , Molly ? "
188607	188610	188612	188612	Molly	365	" Certainly , "
188620	188622	188590	188590	she	365	" No "
188744	188752	188758	188758	she	365	" Oh ! it is no wonder ! "
188823	188831	188796	188796	she	365	" Oh ! it is no wonder ! "
188832	188840	188796	188796	she	365	" Oh ! it is no wonder ! "
188844	188857	188799	188799	herself	365	" Cynthia ! you do love him dearly , do n't you ? "
188871	188884	188886	188886	she	365	" You speak with all the solemnity of an adjuration , Molly ! "
188905	188991	188886	188886	she	365	" Do n't you think I 've given a proof of it ? But you know I 've often told you I 've not the gift of loving ; I said pretty much the same thing to him . I can respect , and I fancy I can admire , and I can like , but I never feel carried off my feet by love for any one , not even for you , little Molly , and I 'm sure I love you more than "
188992	188998	189000	189000	Molly	365	" No , do n't ! "
189017	189041	189000	189000	Molly	365	" Do n't , do n't I wo n't hear you I ought not to have asked you it makes you tell lies ! "
189042	189047	189049	189049	Cynthia	365	" Why , Molly ! "
189061	189078	189049	189049	Cynthia	365	" what 's the matter with you ? One might think you cared for him yourself . "
189079	189082	189084	189084	Molly	365	" I ? "
189123	189182	189107	189107	she	365	" I do care for him ; I think you have won the love of a prince amongst men . Why , I am proud to remember that he has been to me as a brother , and I love him as a sister , and I love you doubly because he has honoured you with his love . "
189183	189191	189193	189193	Cynthia	365	" Come , that 's not complimentary ! "
189223	189268	189107	189107	she	365	" He 's well enough , I daresay , and a great deal too learned and clever for a stupid girl like me ; but even you must acknowledge he 's very plain and awkward ; and I like pretty things and pretty people . "
189269	189319	189358	189358	his	4740	" Cynthia , I wo n't talk to you about him . You know you do n't mean what you are saying , and you only say it out of contradiction , because I praise him . He sha n't be run down by you , even in joke . "
189320	189344	189346	189346	Cynthia	365	" Well , then , we wo n't talk of him at all . I was so surprised when he began to speak so "
189432	189448	189450	189450	Cynthia	365	" Oh ! what blackberries ! you 've gathered them for me , I know ! "
189493	189508	189509	189509	she	365	" How I should like to have gone as far as Paris with him ! "
189512	189534	189509	189509	she	365	" I suppose it would n't have been proper ; but how pleasant it would have been ! I remember at Boulogne "
189538	189572	189509	189509	she	365	" how I used to envy the English who were going to Paris ; it seemed to me then as if nobody stopped at Boulogne , but dull , stupid school - girls . "
189573	189580	189582	189582	Molly	365	" When will he be there ? "
189584	189610	189509	189509	she	365	" On Wednesday , he said . I 'm to write to him there ; at any rate he 's going to write to me . "
189653	189659	189661	189661	Cynthia	365	" Perhaps , after all , "
189670	189677	189661	189661	Cynthia	365	" we shall never be married . "
189678	189685	189687	189687	Molly	365	" Why do you say that ? "
189692	189719	189687	189687	Molly	365	" You have nothing to make you think so . I wonder how you can bear to think you wo n't , even for a moment . "
189720	189723	189725	189725	Cynthia	365	" Oh ! "
189727	189848	189725	189725	Cynthia	365	" you must n't go and take me au grand sťrieux . I daresay I do n't mean what I say , but you see everything seems a dream at present . Still , I think the chances are equal the chances for and against our marriage , I mean . Two years ! it 's a long time ! he may change his mind , or I may ; or some one else may turn up , and I may get engaged to him : what should you think of that , Molly ? I 'm putting such a gloomy thing as death quite on one side , you see ; yet in two years how much may happen ! "
189849	189861	189863	189863	Molly	365	" Do n't talk so , Cynthia , please do n't , "
189867	189886	189863	189863	Molly	365	" One would think you did n't care for him , and he cares so much for you ! "
189887	190005	190006	190006	She	4741	" Why , did I say I did n't care for him ? I was only calculating chances . I 'm sure I hope nothing will happen to prevent the marriage . Only , you know it may , and I thought I was taking a step in wisdom , in looking forward to all the evils that might befall . I 'm sure all the wise people I 've ever known thought it a virtue to have gloomy prognostics of the future . But you 're not in a mood for wisdom or virtue , I see ; so I 'll go and get ready for dinner , and leave you to your vanities of dress . "
190254	190275	190277	190277	she	189	" There , now ! are you comfortable ? for I have a great piece of news to tell you ! "
190284	190293	190295	190295	he	238	" I thought there was something on hand , "
190299	190304	190295	190295	he	238	" Now for it ! "
190305	190320	190229	190229	She	189	" Roger Hamley has been here this afternoon to bid us good - by . "
190321	190340	190342	190343	Mr. Gibson	238	" Good - by ! Is he gone ? I did n't know he was going so soon ! "
190345	190356	190229	190229	She	189	" Yes : never mind , that 's not it . "
190357	190375	190229	190229	She	189	" But tell me ; has he left this neighbourhood ? I wanted to have seen him . "
190376	190418	190229	190229	She	189	" Yes , yes . He left love and regret , and all that sort of thing for you . Now let me get on with my story : he found Cynthia alone , proposed to her , and was accepted . "
190419	190432	190434	190435	Mr. Gibson	238	" Cynthia ? Roger proposed to her , and she accepted him ? "
190439	190460	190229	190229	She	189	" Yes , to be sure . Why not ? you speak as if it was something so very surprising . "
190461	190500	190229	190229	She	189	" Did I ? But I am surprised . He 's a very fine young fellow , and I wish Cynthia joy ; but do you like it ? It will have to be a very long engagement . "
190501	190504	190506	190506	she	4750	" Perhaps , "
190513	190525	190527	190528	Mr. Gibson	238	" At any rate he will be away for two years , "
190530	190540	190541	190541	she	4750	" A great deal may happen in two years , "
190544	190580	190229	190229	She	189	" Yes ! he will have to run many risks , and go into many dangers , and will come back no nearer to the power of maintaining a wife than when he went out . "
190581	190588	190589	190589	she	4750	" I do n't know that , "
190603	190632	190598	190601	one possessing superior knowledge	4751	" A little bird did tell me that Osborne 's life is not so very secure ; and then what will Roger be ? Heir to the estate . "
190633	190641	190643	190643	he	238	" Who told you that about Osborne ? "
190677	190685	190671	190671	his	238	" Who told you , I say ? "
190697	190711	190686	190686	She	4750	" Why ? can you deny it ? Is it not the truth ? "
190712	190737	190686	190686	She	4750	" I ask you again , Hyacinth , who told you that Osborne Hamley 's life is in more danger than mine or yours ? "
190738	190769	190686	190686	She	4750	" Oh , do n't speak in that frightening way . My life is not in danger , I 'm sure ; nor yours either , love , I hope . "
190805	190813	190814	190814	she	4750	" bits of glass were so dangerous , "
190838	190863	190814	190814	she	4750	" Never mind the glass . I ask you again , Hyacinth , who told you anything about Osborne Hamley 's state of health ? "
190864	190889	190891	190891	she	4750	" I am sure I wish no harm to him , and I daresay he is in very good health , as you say , "
190896	190900	190902	190902	he	238	" Who told ? "
190909	190926	190928	190928	she	4750	" Well , if you will know , and will make such a fuss about it , "
190934	190951	190928	190928	she	4750	" it was you yourself you or Dr. Nicholls , I am sure I forget which . "
190952	190998	191056	191056	she	4750	" I never spoke to you on the subject , and I do n't believe Nicholls did . You 'd better tell me at once what you 're alluding to , for I 'm resolved I 'll have it out before we leave this room . "
190999	191008	191009	191009	she	4750	" I wish I 'd never married again , "
191062	191147	191056	191056	she	4750	" You should not talk your medical secrets so loud then , if you do n't want people to hear them . I had to go into the store - room that day Dr. Nicholls was here ; cook wanted a jar of preserve , and stopped me just as I was going out I am sure it was for no pleasure of mine , for I was sadly afraid of stickying my gloves it was all that you might have a comfortable dinner . "
191171	191182	191160	191160	he	4755	" Well ! you overheard our conversation , I suppose ? "
191183	191187	191188	191188	she	4750	" Not much , "
191204	191211	191188	191188	she	4750	" Only a sentence or two . "
191212	191217	191218	191218	he	4755	" What were they ? "
191221	191251	191160	191160	he	4755	" Why , you had just been saying something , and Dr. Nicholls said , ' If he has got aneurism of the aorta his days are numbered . ' "
191252	191258	191188	191188	she	4750	" Well . Anything more ? "
191259	191290	191160	191160	he	4755	" Yes ; you said , ' I hope to God I may be mistaken ; but there is a pretty clear indication of symptoms , in my opinion . ' "
191291	191303	191304	191304	he	4755	" How do you know we were speaking of Osborne Hamley ? "
191354	191374	191333	191333	she	4750	" Oh ! I know . I heard his name mentioned by you both before I began to listen . "
191375	191383	191333	191333	she	4750	" Then you own you did listen ? "
191384	191387	191389	191389	she	4750	" Yes , "
191396	191415	191333	191333	she	4750	" And pray how do you come to remember so exactly the name of the disease spoken of ? "
191416	191437	191333	191333	she	4750	" Because I went now do n't be angry , I really ca n't see any harm in what I did "
191438	191448	191333	191333	she	4750	" Then , do n't deprecate anger . You went "
191449	191464	191333	191333	she	4750	" Into the surgery , and looked it out . Why might not I ? "
191501	191513	191492	191492	he	238	" Well ! I suppose as one brews one must bake . "
191514	191523	191525	191525	she	4750	" I do n't understand what you mean , "
191527	191531	191532	191532	he	238	" Perhaps not , "
191535	191571	191532	191532	he	238	" I suppose that it was what you heard on that occasion that made you change your behaviour to Roger Hamley ? I 've noticed how much more civil you were to him of late . "
191572	191617	191492	191492	he	238	" If you mean that I have ever got to like him as much as Osborne , you are very much mistaken ; no , not even though he has offered to Cynthia , and is to be my son - in - law . "
191618	191693	191532	191532	he	238	" Let me know the whole affair . You overheard , I will own that it was Osborne about whom we were speaking , though I shall have something to say about that presently and then , if I understand you rightly , you changed your behaviour to Roger , and made him more welcome to this house than you had ever done before , regarding him as proximate heir to the Hamley estates ? "
191694	191707	191492	191492	he	238	" I do n't know what you mean by ' proximate . ' "
191708	191722	191724	191724	he	4756	" Go into the surgery , and look into the dictionary , then , "
191737	191741	191743	191743	she	4757	" I knew , "
191749	191832	191743	191743	she	4757	" that Roger had taken a fancy to Cynthia ; any one might see that ; and as long as Roger was only a younger son , with no profession , and nothing but his fellowship , I thought it right to discourage him , as any one would who had a grain of common sense in them ; for a clumsier , more common , awkward , stupid fellow I never saw to be called ' county , ' I mean . "
191833	191857	191871	191871	his	4759	" Take care ; you 'll have to eat your words presently when you come to fancy he 'll have Hamley some day . "
191858	191865	191867	191867	she	4758	" No , I sha n't , "
191875	191925	191867	191867	she	4758	" You are vexed now because it is not Molly he 's in love with ; and I call it very unjust and unfair to my poor fatherless girl . I am sure I have always tried to further Molly 's interests as if she was my own daughter . "
191953	192018	191871	191871	his	4759	" The point I want to be clear about is this . Did you or did you not alter your behaviour to Roger in consequence of what you overheard of my professional conversation with Dr. Nicholls ? Have you not favoured his suit to Cynthia since then , on the understanding gathered from that conversation that he stood a good chance of inheriting Hamley ? "
192019	192025	192027	192027	she	4760	" I suppose I did , "
192031	192138	192027	192027	she	4760	" And if I did , I ca n't see any harm in it , that I should be questioned as if I were in a witness - box . He was in love with Cynthia long before that conversation , and she liked him so much . It was not for me to cross the path of true love . I do n't see how you would have a mother show her love for her child if she may not turn accidental circumstances to her advantage . Perhaps Cynthia might have died if she had been crossed in love ; her poor father was consumptive . "
192139	192175	191871	191871	his	4759	" Do n't you know that all professional conversations are confidential ? That it would be the most dishonourable thing possible for me to betray secrets which I learn in the exercise of my profession ? "
192176	192184	192027	192027	she	4760	" Yes , of course , you . "
192185	192242	192243	192243	He	4761	" Well ! and are not you and I one in all these respects ? You can not do a dishonourable act without my being inculpated in the disgrace . If it would be a deep disgrace for me to betray a professional secret , what would it be for me to trade on that knowledge ? "
192263	192311	192027	192027	she	4760	" I do n't know what you mean by trading . Trading in a daughter 's affections is the last thing I should do ; and I should have thought you would be rather glad than otherwise to get Cynthia well married , and off your hands . "
192346	192357	192358	192358	he	238	" I do n't know what to say to you , "
192363	192473	192358	192358	he	238	" You either ca n't or wo n't see what I mean . I 'm glad enough to have Cynthia here . I have given her a true welcome , and I sincerely hope she will find this house as much a home as my own daughter does . But for the future I must look out of my doors , and double - lock the approaches if I am so foolish as to However , that 's past and gone ; and it remains with me to prevent its recurrence as far as I can for the future . Now let us hear the present state of affairs . "
192474	192501	192027	192027	she	4760	" I do n't think I ought to tell you anything about it . It is a secret , just as much as your mysteries are . "
192502	192563	192358	192358	he	238	" Very well ; you have told me enough for me to act upon , which I most certainly shall do . It was only the other day I promised the Squire to let him know if I suspected anything any love affair , or entanglement , much less an engagement , between either of his sons and our girls . "
192564	192646	192027	192027	she	4760	" But this is not an engagement ; he would not let it be so ; if you would only listen to me , I could tell you all . Only I do hope you wo n't go and tell the Squire and everybody . Cynthia did so beg that it might not be known . It is only my unfortunate frankness that has led me into this scrape . I never could keep a secret from those whom I love . "
192647	192750	192358	192358	he	238	" I must tell the Squire . I shall not mention it to any one else . And do you quite think it was consistent with your general frankness to have overheard what you did , and never to have mentioned it to me ? I could have told you then that Dr. Nicholls ' opinion was decidedly opposed to mine , and that he believed that the disturbance about which I consulted him on Osborne 's behalf was merely temporary . Dr. Nicholls would tell you that Osborne is as likely as any man to live and marry and beget children . "
192806	192822	192824	192824	he	238	" Let us review this misfortune , for I see you consider it as such , "
192826	192834	192836	192836	she	189	" No , not quite a misfortune , "
192838	192851	192852	192852	she	189	" But , certainly , if I had known Dr. Nicholls ' opinion "
192855	192865	192866	192866	he	238	" You see the advantage of always consulting me , "
192870	192875	192866	192866	he	238	" Here is Cynthia engaged "
192876	192899	192836	192836	she	189	" Not engaged , I told you before . He would not allow it to be considered an engagement on her part . "
192900	192957	192866	192866	he	238	" Well , entangled in a love - affair with a lad of three - and - twenty , with nothing beyond his fellowship and a chance of inheriting an encumbered estate ; no profession even , abroad for two years , and I must go and tell his father all about it to - morrow . "
192958	192979	192836	192836	she	189	" Oh dear ! Pray say that , if he dislikes it , he has only to express his opinion . "
192980	193015	192866	192866	he	238	" I do n't think you can act without Cynthia in the affair . And if I am not mistaken , Cynthia will have a pretty stout will of her own on the subject . "
193016	193078	192836	192836	she	189	" Oh , I do n't think she cares for him very much ; she is not one to be always falling in love , and she does not take things very deeply to heart . But , of course , one would not do anything abruptly ; two years ' absence gives one plenty of time to turn oneself in . "
193079	193101	192866	192866	he	238	" But a little while ago we were threatened with consumption and an early death if Cynthia 's affections were thwarted . "
193102	193177	192836	192836	she	189	" Oh , you dear creature , how you remember all my silly words ! It might be , you know . Poor dear Mr. Kirkpatrick was consumptive , and Cynthia may have inherited it , and a great sorrow might bring out the latent seeds . At times I am so fearful . But I daresay it is not probable , for I do n't think she takes things very deeply to heart . "
193178	193204	192866	192866	he	238	" Then I 'm quite at liberty to give up the affair , acting as Cynthia 's proxy , if the Squire disapproves of it ? "
193216	193219	193220	193220	she	189	" No ! "
193225	193268	193220	193220	she	189	" We can not give it up . I am sure Cynthia would not ; especially if she thought others were acting for her . And he really is very much in love . I wish he were in Osborne 's place . "
193269	193279	193281	193282	Mr. Gibson	238	" Shall I tell you what I should do ? "
193288	193400	193281	193282	Mr. Gibson	238	" However it may have been brought about , here are two young people in love with each other . One is as fine a young fellow as ever breathed ; the other a very pretty , lively , agreeable girl . The father of the young man must be told , and it is most likely he will bluster and oppose ; for there is no doubt it is an imprudent affair as far as money goes . But let them be steady and patient , and a better lot need await no young woman . I only wish it were Molly 's good fortune to meet with such another . "
193401	193412	193414	193415	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I will try for her ; I will indeed , "
193424	193447	193281	193282	Mr. Gibson	238	" No , do n't . That 's one thing I forbid . I 'll have no ' trying ' for Molly . "
193448	193476	193281	193282	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , do n't be angry , dear ! Do you know I was quite afraid you were going to lose your temper at one time . "
193477	193486	193488	193488	he	238	" It would have been of no use ! "
193681	193687	193689	193689	she	365	" Has mamma told you ? "
193699	193722	193689	193689	she	365	" It is hardly an engagement ; and we all pledged ourselves to keep it a secret , mamma among the rest ! "
193723	193748	193750	193751	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But , my dearest Cynthia , you could not expect you could not have wished me to keep a secret from my husband ? "
193753	193765	193767	193767	Cynthia	365	" No , perhaps not . At any rate , sir , "
193776	193834	193835	193835	she	365	" I am glad you should know it . You have always been a most kind friend to me , and I daresay I should have told you myself , but I did not want it named ; if you please , it must still be a secret . In fact , it is hardly an engagement he "
193852	193854	193906	193906	he	238	" he "
193862	193877	193906	193906	he	238	" would not allow me to bind myself by any promise until his return ! "
193917	193958	193906	193906	he	238	" I hope you are worthy of him , Cynthia , for you have indeed drawn a prize . I have never known a truer or warmer heart than Roger 's ; and I have known him boy and man . "
193996	194008	194010	194010	she	365	" You are not complimentary , are you , Mr. Gibson ? "
194012	194041	194010	194010	she	365	" He thinks me worthy , I suppose ; and if you have so high an opinion of him , you ought to respect his judgment of me . "
194121	194125	194128	194128	she	365	" Dear Cynthia , "
194144	194168	194132	194132	she	365	" Oh , Molly , I am so fond of your father ; what makes him speak so to me to - night ? "
194169	194175	194177	194177	Molly	365	" I do n't know , "
194179	194185	194177	194177	Molly	365	" perhaps he 's tired . "
194210	194271	194196	194196	He	238	" I hope you will not consider it a breach of confidence , Cynthia , but I must tell the Squire of of what has taken place to - day between you and his son . I have bound myself by a promise to him . He was afraid it 's as well to tell you the truth he was afraid "
194278	194329	194196	194196	He	238	" of something of this kind between his sons and one of you two girls . It was only the other day I assured him there was nothing of the kind on foot ; and I told him then I would inform him at once if I saw any symptoms . "
194335	194346	194196	194196	He	238	" It was the one thing I stipulated for secrecy . "
194347	194351	194353	194354	Mr. Gibson	238	" But why ? "
194356	194390	194353	194354	Mr. Gibson	238	" I can understand your not wishing to have it made public under the present circumstances . But the nearest friends on both sides ! Surely you can have no objection to that ? "
194391	194397	194399	194399	Cynthia	365	" Yes , I have , "
194401	194417	194399	194399	Cynthia	365	" I would not have had any one know if I could have helped it . "
194418	194429	194353	194354	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 'm almost certain Roger will tell his father . "
194430	194437	194439	194439	Cynthia	365	" No , he wo n't , "
194441	194457	194439	194439	Cynthia	365	" I made him promise , and I think he is one to respect a promise "
194483	194536	194547	194547	she	365	" Well , at any rate , the story would come with so much better a grace from him that I shall give him the chance ; I wo n't go over to the Hall till the end of the week ; he may have written and told his father before then . "
194554	194572	194547	194547	she	365	" A man 's promise is to override a woman 's wish , then , is it ? "
194573	194585	194547	194547	she	365	" I do n't see any reason why it should not . "
194586	194611	194612	194612	She	365	" Will you trust in my reasons when I tell you it will cause me a great deal of distress if it gets known ? "
194656	194696	194651	194651	he	238	" Telling Roger 's father is not making it public . I do n't like this exaggerated desire for such secrecy , Cynthia . It seems to me as if something more than is apparent was concealed behind it . "
194697	194702	194704	194704	Cynthia	365	" Come , Molly , "
194708	194730	194704	194704	Cynthia	365	" let us sing that duet I 've been teaching you ; it 's better than talking as we are doing . "
195061	195068	195054	195055	Mr. Gibson	238	" Any news from Roger yet ? "
195069	195079	195081	195082	the Squire	1206	" Oh , yes ; here 's his letter , "
195134	195156	195158	195159	Mr. Gibson	238	" Hum ! I see he does n't name one very important event that has befallen him since he left you , "
195169	195267	195158	195159	Mr. Gibson	238	" I believe I 'm committing a breach of confidence on one side ; but I 'm going to keep the promise I made the last time I was here . I find there is something something of the kind you apprehended you understand between him and my step - daughter , Cynthia Kirkpatrick . He called at our house to wish us good - by , while waiting for the London coach , found her alone , and spoke to her . They do n't call it an engagement , but of course it is one . "
195268	195275	195277	195278	the Squire	1206	" Give me back the letter , "
195317	195320	195321	195321	he	1206	" No ! "
195330	195354	195321	195321	he	1206	" He tells me nothing about it . Lads may play at confidences with their fathers , but they keep a deal back . "
195388	195396	195398	195399	the Squire	1206	" He 's not the eldest son , "
195408	195428	195430	195430	he	1206	" But it 's not the match I should have planned for him . How came you , sir , "
195439	195473	195430	195430	he	1206	" to say when you were last here , that there was nothing between my sons and either of your girls ? Why , this must have been going on all the time ! "
195474	195509	195430	195430	he	1206	" I 'm afraid it was . But I was as ignorant about it as the babe unborn . I only heard of it on the evening of the day of Roger 's departure . "
195510	195528	195430	195430	he	1206	" And that 's a week ago , sir . What 's kept you quiet ever since ? "
195529	195539	195430	195430	he	1206	" I thought that Roger would tell you himself . "
195540	195672	195430	195430	he	1206	" That shows you 've no sons . More than half their life is unknown to their fathers . Why , Osborne there , we live together that 's to say , we have our meals together , and we sleep under the same roof and yet Well ! well ! life is as God has made it . You say it 's not an engagement yet ? But I wonder what I 'm doing ? Hoping for my lad 's disappointment in the folly he 's set his heart on and just when he 's been helping me . Is it a folly , or is it not ? I ask you , Gibson , for you must know this girl . She has n't much money , I suppose ? "
195673	195689	195430	195430	he	1206	" About thirty pounds a year , at my pleasure during her mother 's life . "
195690	195728	195430	195430	he	1206	" Whew ! It 's well he 's not Osborne . They 'll have to wait . What family is she of ? None of 'em in trade , I reckon , from her being so poor ? "
195729	195760	195430	195430	he	1206	" I believe her father was grandson of a certain Sir Gerald Kirkpatrick . Her mother tells me it is an old baronetcy . I know nothing of such things . "
195761	195787	195430	195430	he	1206	" That 's something . I do know something of such things , as you are pleased to call them . I like honourable blood . "
195795	195829	195788	195789	Mr. Gibson	238	" But I 'm afraid that only one - eighth of Cynthia 's blood is honourable ; I know nothing further of her relations excepting the fact that her father was a curate . "
195830	195848	195430	195430	he	1206	" Professional . That 's a step above trade at any rate . How old is she ? "
195849	195854	195788	195789	Mr. Gibson	238	" Eighteen or nineteen . "
195855	195858	195430	195430	he	1206	" Pretty ? "
195859	195924	195788	195789	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , I think so ; most people do ; but it 's all a matter of taste . Come , Squire , judge for yourself . Ride over and take lunch with us any day you like . I may not be in ; but her mother will be there , and you can make acquaintance with your son 's future wife . "
195966	195999	195963	195963	he	203	" Roger 's ' future wife ! ' He 'll be wiser by the time he comes home . Two years among the black folk will have put more sense in him . "
196000	196011	196013	196014	Mr. Gibson	238	" Possible , but not probable , I should say , "
196016	196076	196013	196014	Mr. Gibson	238	" Black folk are not remarkable for their powers of reasoning , I believe , so that they have n't much chance of altering his opinion by argument , even if they understood each other 's language ; and certainly if he shares my taste , their peculiarity of complexion will only make him appreciate white skins the more . "
196077	196086	196088	196089	the Squire	1206	" But you said it was no engagement , "
196091	196110	196088	196089	the Squire	1206	" If he thinks better of it , you wo n't keep him to it , will you ? "
196111	196194	196196	196196	he	1206	" If he wishes to break it off , I shall certainly advise Cynthia to be equally willing , that 's all I can say . And I see no reason for discussing the affair further at present . I 've told you how matters stand because I promised you I would , if I saw anything of this kind going on . But in the present condition of things , we can neither make nor mar ; we can only wait . "
196210	196247	196196	196196	he	1206	" Do n't go , Gibson . Do n't take offence at what I 've said , though I 'm sure I do n't know why you should . What 's the girl like in herself ? "
196248	196257	196259	196260	Mr. Gibson	238	" I do n't know what you mean , "
196278	196330	196196	196196	he	1206	" Is she well , is she like your Molly ? sweet - tempered and sensible with her gloves always mended , and neat about the feet , and ready to do anything one asks her just as if doing it was the very thing she liked best in the world ? "
196352	196471	196196	196196	he	1206	" She is much prettier than Molly to begin with , and has very winning ways . She 's always well - dressed and smart - looking , and I know she has n't much to spend on her clothes , and always does what she 's asked to do , and is ready enough with her pretty , lively answers . I do n't think I ever saw her out of temper ; but then I 'm not sure if she takes things keenly to heart , and a certain obtuseness of feeling goes a great way towards a character for good temper , I 've observed . Altogether I think Cynthia is one in a hundred . "
196478	196519	196521	196521	he	1206	" Your Molly is one in a thousand , to my mind . But then , you see , she comes of no family at all , and I do n't suppose she 'll have a chance of much money . "
196549	196585	196544	196544	he	1206	" Well , but as there 's no question of Molly in this business , I do n't see the use of bringing her name in , and considering either her family or her fortune . "
196586	196594	196596	196597	the Squire	1206	" No , to be sure not , "
196602	196646	196596	196597	the Squire	1206	" My wits had gone far afield , and I 'll own I was only thinking what a pity it was she would n't do for Osborne . But , of course , it 's out of the question out of the question . "
196647	196650	196652	196653	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , "
196655	196685	196652	196653	Mr. Gibson	238	" and if you will excuse me , Squire , I really must go now , and then you 'll be at liberty to send your wits afield uninterrupted . "
196721	196982	196700	196700	He	1206	" I say , Gibson , we 're old friends , and you 're a fool if you take anything I say as an offence . Madam your wife and I did n't hit it off the only time I ever saw her . I wo n't say she was silly , but I think one of us was silly , and it was n't me . However , we 'll pass that over . Suppose you bring her , and this girl Cynthia which is as outlandish a Christian name as I 'd wish to hear , and little Molly out here to lunch some day , I 'm more at my ease in my own house , and I 'm more sure to be civil , too . We need say nothing about Roger , neither the lass nor me , and you keep your wife 's tongue quiet , if you can . It will only be like a compliment to you on your marriage , you know and no one must take it for anything more . Mind , no allusion or mention of Roger , and this piece of folly . I shall see the girl then , and I can judge her for myself ; for , as you say , that will be the best plan . Osborne will be here too ; and he 's always in his element talking to women . I sometimes think he 's half a woman himself , he spends so much money and is so unreasonable . "
197901	197904	197896	197896	she	189	" artistic ; "
197966	197988	197962	197963	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , Cynthia ; I 've seen the Squire to - day , and made a clean breast of it . "
198010	198033	197999	197999	Molly	365	" You 're all to go there on Thursday to lunch ; he asked you all , and I promised for you . "
198046	198060	198062	198063	Mr. Gibson	238	" You 'll be glad of that , Cynthia , sha n't you ? "
198065	198088	198062	198063	Mr. Gibson	238	" It may be a little formidable , but I hope it will be the beginning of a good understanding between you . "
198089	198093	198095	198095	she	365	" Thank you ! "
198101	198136	198095	198095	she	365	" But but wo n't it make it public ? I do so wish not to have it known , or talked about , not till he comes back or close upon the marriage . "
198137	198149	198151	198152	Mr. Gibson	238	" I do n't see how it should make it public , "
198154	198179	198151	198152	Mr. Gibson	238	" My wife goes to lunch with my friend , and takes her daughters with her there 's nothing in that , is there ? "
198180	198190	198193	198194	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am not sure that I shall go , "
198268	198272	198274	198274	he	238	" Why not ? "
198281	198318	198274	198274	he	238	" Oh , because because I think he ought to have called on Cynthia first ; I 've that sort of sensitiveness I ca n't bear to think of her being slighted because she is poor . "
198319	198322	198324	198325	Mr. Gibson	238	" Nonsense ! "
198327	198417	198324	198325	Mr. Gibson	238	" I do assure you , no slight whatever was intended . He does not wish to speak about the engagement to any one not even to Osborne that 's your wish , too , is n't it , Cynthia ? Nor does he intend to mention it to any of you when you go there ; but , naturally enough , he wants to make acquaintance with his future daughter - in - law . If he deviated so much from his usual course as to come calling here "
198418	198432	198434	198435	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am sure I do n't want him to come calling here , "
198439	198485	198434	198435	Mrs. Gibson	189	" He was not so very agreeable the only time he did come . But I am that sort of a character that I can not put up with any neglect of persons I love , just because they are not smiled upon by fortune . "
198497	198507	198509	198510	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , then , you wo n't go ! "
198531	198539	198541	198542	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do you wish it , Cynthia ? "
198568	198583	198552	198553	her daughter	698	" Not particularly , mamma . I am quite willing to refuse the invitation . "
198584	198590	198592	198593	Mr. Gibson	238	" It is already accepted , "
198658	198666	198668	198668	Molly	365	" Oh , do go , Cynthia ! "
198680	198708	198668	198668	Molly	365	" Do ; I am sure you will like the Squire ; and it is such a pretty place , and he 'll be so much disappointed . "
198709	198720	198722	198722	Cynthia	365	" I should not like to give up my dignity , "
198726	198734	198722	198722	Cynthia	365	" And you heard what mamma said ! "
198843	198868	198840	198840	she	995	" My dear , do you wish me to go ? if you do , I will put my own feelings on one side . "
198869	198875	198876	198876	he	238	" Of course I do ! "
198888	198894	198896	198896	she	995	" Then I 'll go ! "
198917	198978	198896	198896	she	995	" And we 'll have a fly from the ' George , ' and get a livery - coat for Thomas , which I 've long been wanting , only dear Mr. Gibson did not like it , but on an occasion like this I 'm sure he wo n't mind ; and Thomas shall go on the box , and "
198979	198990	198992	198992	Cynthia	365	" But , mamma , I 've my feelings too , "
198994	199007	198896	198896	she	995	" Nonsense , child ! when all is so nicely arranged too . "
199210	199221	199169	199169	he	238	" And so you went to Hamley yesterday after all ? "
199222	199240	199403	199403	Molly	365	" Yes ; I thought you would have come . The Squire seemed quite to expect you . "
199241	199299	199169	199169	he	238	" I thought of going there at first ; but I changed my mind like other people . I do n't see why women are to have a monopoly of changeableness . Well ! how did it go off ? Pleasantly , I suppose , for both your mother and Cynthia were in high spirits last night . "
199300	199375	199403	199403	Molly	365	" Yes . The dear old Squire was in his best dress and on his best behaviour , and was so prettily attentive to Cynthia , and she looked so lovely , walking about with him , and listening to all his talk about the garden and farm . Mamma was tired , and stopped in - doors , so they got on very well , and saw a great deal of each other . "
199376	199384	199169	199169	he	238	" And my little girl trotted behind ? "
199385	199402	199403	199403	Molly	365	" Oh , yes . You know I was almost at home , and besides of course "
199414	199424	199432	199432	she	365	" Do you think she 's worthy of him ? "
199438	199461	199169	199169	he	238	" Of Roger , papa ? oh , who is ? But she is very sweet , and very , very charming . "
199462	199519	199403	199403	Molly	365	" Very charming if you will , but somehow I do n't quite understand her . Why does she want all this secrecy ? Why was she not more eager to go and pay her duty to Roger 's father ? She took it as coolly as if I 'd asked her to go to church ! "
199520	199550	199169	199169	he	238	" I do n't think she did take it coolly ; I believe I do n't quite understand her either , but I love her dearly all the same . "
199551	199580	199403	199403	Molly	365	" Umph ; I like to understand people thoroughly , but I know it 's not necessary to women . D'ye really think she 's worthy of him ? "
199581	199585	199587	199587	Molly	365	" Oh , papa "
199657	199664	199647	199647	he	4845	" Yes ; on Wednesday morning . "
199665	199693	199647	199647	he	4845	" Did she show it to you ? But of course not . Besides , I read the Squire 's letter , which told all about him . "
199766	199772	199774	199775	Mr. Gibson	238	" Was Osborne at home ? "
199777	199798	199774	199775	Mr. Gibson	238	" The Squire said he did not think he would have come back ; but the young fellow is so uncertain "
199799	199808	199810	199810	Molly	365	" No , he was still from home . "
199926	199985	199986	199986	He	238	" Molly , I was taken by surprise by this affair between Cynthia and Roger Hamley if there 's anything more on the tapis let me know at once , honestly and openly . I know it 's an awkward question for you to reply to ; but I would n't ask it unless I had good reasons . "
200034	200084	200026	200026	she	365	" If you mean that you 're afraid that Osborne thinks of me as Roger thinks of Cynthia , papa , you are quite mistaken . Osborne and I are friends and nothing more , and never can be anything more . That 's all I can tell you . "
200085	200123	200124	200124	He	4853	" It 's quite enough , little one . It 's a great relief . I do n't want to have my Molly carried off by any young man just yet ; I should miss her sadly . "
200173	200178	200180	200180	he	4853	" There , there ! "
200195	200249	200250	200250	he	4853	" that will do . I get quite enough of tears in the day , shed for real causes , not to want them at home , where , I hope , they are shed for no cause at all . There 's nothing really the matter , is there , my dear ? "
200296	200322	200277	200277	he	4853	" Nothing , dear , dear papa nothing now . It is such a comfort to have you all to myself it makes me happy . "
200376	200428	200369	200369	he	4853	" That 's right , dear ! I can leave you in comfort now , and indeed I 've stayed too long already gossiping . Go out and have a walk take Cynthia with you , if you like . I must be off . Good - by , little one . "
200838	200845	200810	200810	He	238	" all that he knew of , "
200979	201031	200968	200968	she	189	" It is such a pleasure to me to make acquaintance with the former pupils of my husband . He has spoken to me so often of you that I quite feel as if you were one of the family , as indeed I am sure that Mr. Gibson considers you . "
201052	201058	201060	201060	he	207	" Is Miss Gibson in ? "
201065	201099	201060	201060	he	207	" I knew her formerly that is to say , I lived in the same house with her , for more than two years , and it would be a great pleasure to to "
201100	201159	201160	201160	She	4875	" Certainly , I am sure she will be so glad to see you . I sent her and Cynthia you do n't know my daughter Cynthia , I think , Mr. Coxe ? she and Molly are such great friends out for a brisk walk this frosty day , but I think they will soon come back . "
201299	201309	201311	201311	she	4875	" Oh , Mr. Coxe , is it you ? "
201329	201360	201361	201361	he	1034	" Yes ; it seems such a long time since I saw you . You are so much grown so much well , I suppose I must n't say what , "
201732	201735	201748	201749	Mr. Gibson	238	" George , "
201962	202056	201953	201953	he	207	" Mr. Gibson , I daresay you 'll be surprised , I 'm sure I am at at what I want to say ; but I think it 's the part of an honourable man , as you said yourself , sir , a year or two ago , to to speak to the father first , and as you , sir , stand in the place of a father to Miss Kirkpatrick , I should like to express my feelings , my hopes , or perhaps I should say wishes , in short "
202057	202061	202063	202064	Mr. Gibson	238	" Miss Kirkpatrick ? "
202071	202076	202078	202079	Mr. Coxe	207	" Yes , sir ! "
202090	202189	202190	202190	he	207	" I know it may appear inconstant and changeable , but I do assure you , I came here with a heart as faithful to your daughter as ever beat in a man 's bosom . I most fully intended to offer myself and all that I had to her acceptance before I left ; but really , sir , if you had seen her manner to me every time I endeavoured to press my suit a little it was more than coy , it was absolutely repellent , there could be no mistaking it , while Miss Kirkpatrick "
202211	202216	202218	202219	Mr. Gibson	238	" While Miss Kirkpatrick ? "
202265	202339	202341	202342	Mr. Coxe	207	" I was only going to say , sir , that so far as one can judge from manner , and willingness to listen , and apparent pleasure in my visits altogether , I think I may venture to hope that Miss Kirkpatrick is not quite indifferent to me , and I would wait , you have no objection , have you , sir , to my speaking to her , I mean ? "
202356	202370	202371	202371	he	207	" I do assure you I have n't a chance with Miss Gibson , "
202393	202439	202371	202371	he	207	" No ! I do n't suppose you have . Do n't go and fancy it is that which is annoying me . You 're mistaken about Miss Kirkpatrick , however . I do n't believe she could ever have meant to give you encouragement ! "
202458	202505	202371	202371	he	207	" I think , sir , if you could have seen her I do n't consider myself vain , and manner is so difficult to describe . At any rate , you can have no objection to my taking my chance , and speaking to her . "
202506	202567	202371	202371	he	207	" Of course , if you wo n't be convinced otherwise , I can have no objection . But if you 'll take my advice , you will spare yourself the pain of a refusal . I may , perhaps , be trenching on confidence , but I think I ought to tell you that her affections are otherwise engaged . "
202568	202574	202576	202577	Mr. Coxe	207	" It can not be ! "
202579	202647	202576	202577	Mr. Coxe	207	" Mr. Gibson , there must be some mistake . I have gone as far as I dared in expressing my feelings , and her manner has been most gracious . I do n't think she could have misunderstood my meaning . Perhaps she has changed her mind ? It is possible that , after consideration , she has learnt to prefer another , is it not ? "
202648	202667	202668	202668	he	207	" By ' another , ' you mean yourself , I suppose . I can believe in such inconstancy "
202688	202706	202668	202668	he	207	" but I should be very sorry to think that Miss Kirkpatrick could be guilty of it . "
202707	202724	202668	202668	he	207	" But she may it is a chance . Will you allow me to see her ? "
202725	202731	202668	202668	he	207	" Certainly , my poor fellow "
202764	202773	202668	202668	he	207	" I will send her to you directly . "
202774	202788	202668	202668	he	207	" Thank you , sir . God bless you for a kind friend ! "
202836	202862	202810	202810	she	252	" Cynthia , you will oblige me by going down into my consulting - room at once . Mr. Coxe wants to speak to you ! "
202863	202867	202869	202869	Cynthia	365	" Mr. Coxe ? "
202871	202879	202869	202869	Cynthia	365	" What can he want with me ? "
202965	202990	202958	202958	Molly	365	" Molly , you must never trifle with the love of an honest man . You do n't know what pain you may give . "
203096	203103	203105	203106	Mr. Gibson	238	" Is Mr. Coxe still downstairs ? "
203108	203134	203135	203135	Cynthia	402	" No . He is gone . He asked me to give you both his kind regards . I believe he is leaving this afternoon . "
203204	203215	203217	203217	he	238	" I trust this will never occur again , Cynthia ! "
203223	203356	203217	203217	he	238	" I should not feel satisfied with the conduct of any girl , however free , who could receive marked attentions from a young man with complacency , and so lead him on to make an offer which she never meant to accept . But what must I think of a young woman in your position , engaged yet ' accepting most graciously , ' for that was the way Coxe expressed it the overtures of another man ? Do you consider what unnecessary pain you have given him by your thoughtless behaviour ? I call it thoughtless , but it 's the mildest epithet I can apply to it . I beg that such a thing may not occur again , or I shall be obliged to characterize it more severely . "
203357	203368	203381	203384	Click to ENLARGE Molly	365	" I trust this will never occur again , Cynthia ! "
203369	203380	203217	203217	he	238	" I trust this will never occur again , Cynthia ! "
203389	203392	203381	203384	Click to ENLARGE Molly	365	" more severely "
203469	203530	203423	203423	her	365	" Please , Mr. Gibson , hear my side of the story before you speak so hardly to me . I did not mean to to flirt . I merely meant to make myself agreeable , I ca n't help doing that , and that goose of a Mr. Coxe seems to have fancied I meant to give him encouragement . "
203531	203549	203550	203551	Mr. Gibson	238	" Do you mean that you were not aware that he was falling in love with you ? "
203568	203578	203579	203579	Cynthia	365	" Well , I suppose I must speak truly . "
203601	203666	203595	203596	Mr. Gibson	238	" I did think once or twice that he was becoming a little more complimentary than the occasion required ; but I hate throwing cold water on people , and I never thought he could take it into his silly head to fancy himself seriously in love , and to make such a fuss at the last , after only a fortnight 's acquaintance . "
203667	203710	203579	203579	Cynthia	365	" You seem to have been pretty well aware of his silliness I should rather call it simplicity . Do n't you think you should have remembered that it might lead him to exaggerate what you were doing and saying into encouragement ? "
203711	203728	203730	203730	Cynthia	365	" Perhaps . I daresay I 'm all wrong , and that he is all right , "
203736	203760	203761	203761	she	365	" We used to say in France , that ' les absens ont toujours tort , ' but really it seems as if here "
203794	203825	203779	203779	She	365	" Besides , Roger would not allow me to consider myself as finally engaged to him ; I would willingly have done it , but he would not let me . "
203826	203873	203874	203874	He	4905	" Nonsense . Do n't let us go on talking about it , Cynthia ! I 've said all that I mean to say . I believe that you were only thoughtless , as I told you before . But do n't let it happen again . "
203906	203933	203935	203935	Cynthia	365	" Not guilty , but we recommend the prisoner not to do it again . It 's pretty much that , is n't it , Molly ? "
203947	204023	203944	203944	she	365	" I do believe your father might make a good woman of me yet , if he would only take the pains , and was n't quite so severe . And to think of that stupid little fellow making all this mischief ! He pretended to take it to heart , as if he had loved me for years instead of only for days . I daresay only for hours if the truth were told . "
204024	204036	204038	204038	Molly	365	" I was afraid he was becoming very fond of you , "
204040	204082	204038	204038	Molly	365	" at least it struck me once or twice ; but I knew he could not stay long , and I thought it would only make you uncomfortable if I said anything about it . But now I wish I had ! "
204083	204094	204096	204096	Cynthia	365	" It would n't have made a bit of difference , "
204098	204182	204096	204096	Cynthia	365	" I knew he liked me , and I like to be liked ; it 's born in me to try to make every one I come near fond of me ; but then they should n't carry it too far , for it becomes very troublesome if they do . I shall hate red - haired people for the rest of my life . To think of such a man as that being the cause of your father 's displeasure with me ! "
204215	204223	204212	204212	her	365	" Shall you tell Roger about it ? "
204227	204254	204224	204224	Cynthia	365	" I 've not thought about it no ! I do n't think I shall there 's no need . Perhaps , if we are ever married "
204255	204259	204261	204261	Molly	365	" Ever married ! "
204285	204320	204264	204264	her	365	" and I can see his face and know his mood , I may tell it him then ; but not in writing , and when he is absent ; it might annoy him . "
204321	204331	204333	204333	Molly	365	" I am afraid it would make him uncomfortable , "
204337	204358	204333	204333	Molly	365	" And yet it must be so pleasant to be able to tell him everything all your difficulties and troubles . "
204359	204463	204480	204480	she	365	" Yes ; only I do n't worry him with these things ; it 's better to write him merry letters , and cheer him up among the black folk . You repeated ' Ever married , ' a little while ago ; do you know , Molly , I do n't think I ever shall be married to him ? I do n't know why , but I have a strong presentiment , so it 's just as well not to tell him all my secrets , for it would be awkward for him to know them if it never came off ! "
204483	204494	204480	204480	she	365	" I think it would break his heart , Cynthia ! "
204495	204555	204480	204480	she	365	" Nonsense . Why , I 'm sure that Mr. Coxe came here with the intention of falling in love with you you need n't blush so violently . I 'm sure you saw it as plainly as I did , only you made yourself disagreeable , and I took pity on him , and consoled his wounded vanity . "
204556	204570	204572	204572	Molly	365	" Can you do you dare to compare Roger Hamley to Mr. Coxe ? "
204576	204585	204587	204587	Cynthia	365	" No , no , I do n't ! "
204592	204637	204587	204587	Cynthia	365	" They are as different as men can be . Do n't be so dreadfully serious over everything , Molly . You look as oppressed with sad reproach , as if I had been passing on to you the scolding your father gave me . "
204638	204653	204655	204655	Molly	365	" Because I do n't think you value Roger as you ought , Cynthia ! "
204685	204779	204587	204587	Cynthia	365	" Yes , I do ! It 's not in my nature to go into ecstasies , and I do n't suppose I shall ever be what people call ' in love . ' But I am glad he loves me , and I like to make him happy , and I think him the best and most agreeable man I know , always excepting your father when he is n't angry with me . What can I say more , Molly ? would you like me to say I think him handsome ? "
204780	204790	204655	204655	Molly	365	" I know most people think him plain , but "
204791	204827	204835	204835	Cynthia	247	" Well , I 'm of the opinion of most people then , and small blame to them . But I like his face oh , ten thousand times better than Mr. Preston 's handsomeness ! "
204899	204911	204980	204980	Cynthia	365	" Cynthia , what makes you dislike Mr. Preston so much ? "
204912	204928	204930	204930	she	4907	" Do n't you ? Why do you ask me ? and yet , Molly , "
204951	204967	204949	204949	her	4907	" Molly , what should you think of me if I married him after all ? "
204968	204978	204949	204949	her	4907	" Married him ! Has he ever asked you ? "
204997	205069	204993	204993	her	365	" More unlikely things have happened . Have you never heard of strong wills mesmerizing weaker ones into submission ? One of the girls at Madame Lefevre 's went out as a governess to a Russian family , who lived near Moscow . I sometimes think I 'll write to her to find me a situation in Russia , just to get out of the daily chance of seeing that man ! "
205070	205084	204949	204949	her	4907	" But sometimes you seem quite intimate with him , and talk to him "
205085	205092	205094	205094	Cynthia	365	" How can I help it ? "
205103	205250	205100	205100	she	365	" We knew him so well at Ashcombe , and he 's not a man to be easily thrown off , I can tell you . I must be civil to him ; it 's not from liking , and he knows it 's not , for I 've told him so . However , we wo n't talk about him . I do n't know how we came to do it , I 'm sure : the mere fact of his existence , and of his being within half a mile of us , is bad enough . Oh ! I wish Roger was at home , and rich , and could marry me at once , and carry me away from that man ! If I 'd thought of it , I really believe I would have taken poor red - haired Mr. Coxe . "
205251	205260	205262	205262	Molly	365	" I do n't understand it at all , "
205264	205296	205262	205262	Molly	365	" I dislike Mr. Preston , but I should never think of taking such violent steps as you speak of , to get away from the neighbourhood in which he lives . "
205297	205308	205310	205310	Cynthia	247	" No , because you are a reasonable little darling , "
205327	205339	205310	205310	Cynthia	247	" At least you 'll acknowledge I 'm a good hater ! "
205340	205351	205262	205262	Molly	365	" Yes . But still I do n't understand it . "
205352	205414	205310	205310	Cynthia	247	" Oh , never mind ! There are old complications with our affairs at Ashcombe . Money matters are at the root of it all . Horrid poverty do let us talk of something else ! Or , better still , let me go and finish my letter to Roger , or I shall be too late for the African mail ! "
205415	205472	205262	205262	Molly	365	" Is n't it gone ? Oh , I ought to have reminded you ! It will be too late . Did you not see the notice at the post - office that letters ought to be in London on the morning of the 10th instead of the evening . Oh , I am so sorry ! "
205473	205542	205544	205544	she	4910	" So am I , but it ca n't be helped . It is to be hoped it will be the greater treat when he does get it . I 've a far greater weight on my heart , because your father seems so displeased with me . I was fond of him , and now he is making me quite a coward . You see , Molly , "
205550	205576	205544	205544	she	4910	" I 've never lived with people with such a high standard of conduct before ; and I do n't quite know how to behave . "
205577	205582	205584	205584	Molly	365	" You must learn , "
205587	205603	205584	205584	Molly	365	" You 'll find Roger quite as strict in his notions of right and wrong . "
205604	205615	205617	205617	Cynthia	365	" Ah , but he 's in love with me ! "
205971	205976	205977	205977	he	238	" accepted the inevitable ; "
205984	205995	205977	205977	he	238	" that it was no use crying over spilt milk : "
206240	206287	206217	206218	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I think dear papa seems a little put out to - day ; we must see that he has a dinner that he likes when he comes home . I have often perceived that everything depends on making a man comfortable in his own house . "
206800	206812	206797	206797	she	365	" Where is he , Cynthia ? What does he say ? "
206845	206882	206837	206837	she	365	" Where ? Oh , I did n't look exactly somewhere in Abyssinia Huon . I ca n't read the word , and it does n't much signify , for it would give me no idea . "
206883	206888	206890	206891	greedy Molly	365	" Is he well ? "
206893	206925	206837	206837	she	365	" Yes , now . He has had a slight touch of fever , he says ; but it 's all over now , and he hopes he is getting acclimatized . "
206926	206952	206837	206837	she	365	" Of fever ! and who took care of him ? he would want nursing , and so far from home . Oh , Cynthia ! "
206953	207011	206837	206837	she	365	" Oh , I do n't fancy he had any nursing , poor fellow ! One does n't expect nursing , and hospitals , and doctors in Abyssinia ; but he had plenty of quinine with him , and I suppose that is the best specific . At any rate he says he is quite well now ! "
207021	207032	206837	206837	she	365	" What is the date of the letter , Cynthia ? "
207033	207045	206837	206837	she	365	" I did n't look . December the December the 10th . "
207046	207054	207056	207056	Molly	365	" That 's nearly two months ago , "
207058	207087	207089	207089	Cynthia	365	" Yes ; but I determined I would n't worry myself with useless anxiety , when he went away . If anything did go wrong , you know , "
207116	207144	206837	206837	she	365	" it would be all over before I even heard of his illness , and I could be of no use to him could I , Molly ? "
207145	207169	206837	206837	she	365	" No . I daresay it is all very true ; only I should think the Squire could not take it so easily . "
207170	207201	206837	206837	she	365	" I always write him a little note when I hear from Roger , but I do n't think I 'll name this touch of fever shall I , Molly ? "
207202	207208	207210	207210	Molly	365	" I do n't know , "
207212	207240	207210	207210	Molly	365	" People say one ought , but I almost wish I had n't heard it . Please , does he say anything else that I may hear ? "
207241	207260	207262	207262	Cynthia	365	" Oh , lovers ' letters are so silly , and I think this is sillier than usual , "
207270	207285	207262	207262	Cynthia	365	" Here 's a piece you may read , from that line to that , "
207290	207326	207262	207262	Cynthia	365	" I have n't read it myself for it looked dullish all about Aristotle and Pliny and I want to get this bonnet - cap made up before we go out to pay our calls . "
207556	207574	207552	207552	Her	365	" O my Lord ! give her the living child , and in no wise slay it , "
207593	207643	207584	207589	the real mother in King Solomon	4946	" Let him live , let him live , even though I may never set eyes upon him again . Have pity upon his father ! Grant that he may come home safe , and live happily with her whom he loves so tenderly so tenderly , O God . "
208547	208554	208556	208558	the old lady	4965	" Dear - ah - me ! "
208583	208764	208575	208575	herself	4965	" who would ha ' thought she 'd such grand relations ! Why , Mr. Ashton told me once that a Queen 's counsel was as like to be a judge as a kitten is like to be a cat . And to think of her being as good as a sister to a judge ! I saw one oncst ; and I know I thought as I should n't wish for a better winter - cloak than his old robes would make me , if I could only find out where I could get 'em second - hand . And I know she 'd her silk gowns turned and dyed and cleaned , and , for aught I know , turned again , while she lived at Ashcombe . Keeping a school , too , and so near akin to this Queen 's counsel all the time ! Well , to be sure , it was n't much of a school only ten young ladies at the best o ' times ; so perhaps he never heard of it . "
208765	208778	208780	208781	Miss Browning	159	" I 've been wondering what they 'll give him to dinner , "
208783	208816	208780	208781	Miss Browning	159	" It is an unlucky time for visitors ; no game to be had , and lamb so late this year , and chicken hardly to be had for love or money . "
208817	208833	208835	208836	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" He 'll have to put up with calf 's head , that he will , "
208840	208943	208835	208836	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" If I 'd ha ' got my usual health I 'd copy out a receipt of my grandmother 's for a rolled calf 's head , and send it to Mrs. Gibson the doctor has been very kind to me all through this illness I wish my daughter in Combermere would send me some autumn chickens I 'd pass 'em on to the doctor , that I would ; but she 's been a - killing of 'em all , and a - sending of them to me , and the last she sent she wrote me word was the last . "
208944	208956	208958	208959	Miss Phobe	159	" I wonder if they 'll give a party for him ! "
208961	208999	208958	208959	Miss Phobe	159	" I should like to see a Queen 's counsel for once in my life . I have seen javelin - men , but that 's the greatest thing in the legal line I ever came across . "
209000	209010	209012	209013	Miss Browning	159	" They 'll ask Mr. Ashton , of course , "
209015	209056	209012	209013	Miss Browning	159	" The three black graces , Law , Physic , and Divinity , as the song calls them . Whenever there 's a second course , there 's always the clergyman of the parish invited in any family of gentility . "
209057	209065	209067	209068	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" I wonder if he 's married ! "
209116	209175	209067	209068	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Yes , he 's married , and must have several children , for Mrs. Gibson said that Cynthia Kirkpatrick had paid them a visit in London , to have lessons with her cousins . And she said that his wife was a most accomplished woman , and of good family , though she brought him no fortune . "
209176	209207	209209	209210	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" It 's a very creditable connection , I 'm sure ; it 's only a wonder to me as how we 've heard so little talk of it before , "
209212	209409	209209	209210	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" At the first look of the thing , I should n't ha ' thought Mrs. Gibson was one to hide away her fine relations under a bushel ; indeed , for that matter , we 're all of us fond o ' turning the best breadth o ' the gown to the front . I remember , speaking o ' breadths , how I 've undone my skirts many a time and oft to put a stain or a grease - spot next to poor Mr. Goodenough . He 'd a soft kind of heart when first we was married , and he said , says he , ' Patty , link thy right arm into my left one , then thou'lt be nearer to my heart ; ' and so we kept up the habit , when , poor man , he 'd a deal more to think on than romancing on which side his heart lay ; so , as I said , I always put my damaged breadths on the right hand , and when we walked arm in arm , as we always did , no one was never the wiser . "
209410	209428	209430	209431	Miss Browning	159	" I should not be surprised if he invited Cynthia to pay him another visit in London , "
209433	209460	209430	209431	Miss Browning	159	" If he did it when he was poor , he 's twenty times more likely to do it now he 's a Queen 's counsel . "
209461	209509	209209	209210	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Ay , work it by the rule o ' three , and she stands a good chance . I only hope it wo n't turn her head ; going up visiting in London at her age . Why , I was fifty before ever I went ! "
209510	209526	209528	209529	Miss Phobe	159	" But she has been in France ; she 's quite a travelled young lady , "
209548	209554	209556	209556	she	165	" It 's a risk , "
209558	209610	209556	209556	she	165	" a great risk . I do n't like saying so to the doctor , but I should n't like having my daughter , if I was him , so cheek - by - jowl with a girl as was brought up in the country where Robespierre and Bonyparte was born . "
209611	209618	209620	209621	Miss Browning	159	" But Buonaparte was a Corsican , "
209640	209776	209637	209638	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" And there 's a great opportunity for cultivation of the mind afforded by intercourse with foreign countries . I always admire Cynthia 's grace of manner , never too shy to speak , yet never putting herself forwards ; she 's quite a help to a party ; and if she has a few airs and graces , why they 're natural at her age ! Now as for dear Molly , there 's a kind of awkwardness about her she broke one of our best china cups last time she was at a party at our house , and spilt the coffee on the new carpet ; and then she got so confused that she hardly did anything but sit in a corner and hold her tongue all the rest of the evening . "
209777	209790	209792	209793	Miss Phobe	159	" She was so sorry for what she 'd done , sister , "
209809	209835	209637	209638	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Well , and did I say she was n't ? but was there any need for her to be stupid all the evening after ? "
209836	209845	209637	209638	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" But you were rather sharp , rather displeased "
209846	209987	209637	209638	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" And I think it my duty to be sharp , ay , and cross too , when I see young folks careless . And when I see my duty clear , I do it ; I 'm not one to shrink from it , and they ought to be grateful to me . It 's not every one that will take the trouble of reproving them , as Mrs. Goodenough knows . I 'm very fond of Molly Gibson , very , for her own sake and for her mother 's too ; I 'm not sure if I do n't think she 's worth half - a - dozen Cynthias , but for all that she should n't break my best china teacup , and then sit doing nothing for her livelihood all the rest of the evening . "
210378	210421	210422	210422	he	4972	" Does the woman think I have nothing to do but run about the country in search of brides and bridegrooms , when this great case of Houghton v. Houghton is coming on , and I have n't a moment to spare ? "
210428	210436	210438	210439	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	4990	" Perhaps she never heard of it , "
210441	210454	210438	210439	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	4990	" Nonsense ! the case has been in the papers for days . "
210455	210467	210438	210439	Mrs. Kirkpatrick	4990	" But she may n't know you are engaged in it . "
210468	210473	210475	210475	he	4972	" She may n't , "
211344	211403	211404	211404	She	189	" I think they might have remembered that I am a generation nearer to them than she is , but nobody thinks of family affection now - a days ; and I liked him so much , and bought a new cookery - book , all to make it pleasant and agreeable and what he was used to . "
211444	211464	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" If you want us to sympathize with you , tell us what is the nature of your woe . "
211465	211493	211495	211495	she	189	" Why , I daresay it 's what he means as a very kind attention , only I think I ought to have been asked before Cynthia , "
211503	211519	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" Who 's he ? and what 's meant for a ' kind attention ' ? "
211520	211582	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" Mr. Kirkpatrick , to be sure . This letter is from him ; and he wants Cynthia to go and pay them a visit , and never says anything about you or me , my dear . And I 'm sure we did our best to make it pleasant ; and he should have asked us first , I think . "
211583	211600	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" As I could n't possibly have gone , it makes very little difference to me . "
211601	211652	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" But I could have gone ; and , at any rate , he should have paid us the compliment : it 's only a proper mark of respect , you know . So ungrateful , too , when I gave up my dressing - room on purpose for him ! "
211653	211709	211436	211437	Her husband	1223	" And I dressed for dinner every day he was here , if we are each to recapitulate all our sacrifices on his behalf . But , for all that , I did n't expect to be invited to his house . I shall be only too glad if he will come again to mine . "
211710	211722	211724	211725	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 've a great mind not to let Cynthia go , "
211728	211736	211738	211738	Cynthia	365	" I ca n't go , mamma , "
211742	211760	211738	211738	Cynthia	365	" My gowns are all so shabby , and my old bonnet must do for the summer . "
211761	211811	211812	211812	Cynthia	365	" Well , but you can buy a new one ; and I 'm sure it is high time you should get yourself another silk gown . You must have been saving up a great deal , for I do n't know when you 've had any new clothes . "
211859	211891	211855	211855	she	365	" I can not go . I should like it very much ; but I really can not go . Please , mamma , write at once , and refuse it . "
211892	211935	211855	211855	she	365	" Nonsense , child ! When a man in Mr. Kirkpatrick 's position comes forward to offer a favour , it does not do to decline it without giving a sufficient reason . So kind of him as it is , too ! "
211936	211946	211948	211948	Cynthia	365	" Suppose you offer to go instead of me ? "
211950	211960	211962	211963	Mr. Gibson	238	" No , no ! that wo n't do , "
211967	212004	211962	211963	Mr. Gibson	238	" You ca n't transfer invitations in that way . But , really , this excuse about your clothes does appear to be very trivial , Cynthia , if you have no other reason to give . "
212005	212016	212018	212018	Cynthia	365	" It is a real , true reason to me , "
212028	212100	212018	212018	Cynthia	365	" You must let me judge for myself . It would not do to go there in a state of shabbiness , for even in Doughty Street , I remember , my aunt was very particular about dress ; and now that Margaret and Helen are grown up , and they visit so much , pray do n't say anything more about it , for I know it would not do . "
212101	212114	212116	212117	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What have you done with all your money , I wonder ? "
212119	212146	212116	212117	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You 've twenty pounds a year , thanks to Mr. Gibson and me ; and I 'm sure you have n't spent more than ten . "
212147	212160	212162	212162	Cynthia	365	" I had n't many things when I came back from France , "
212177	212199	212200	212200	She	365	" Pray let it be decided at once ; I ca n't go , and there 's an end of it . "
212211	212220	212222	212223	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't understand it at all , "
212225	212231	212222	212223	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do you , Molly ? "
212232	212252	212253	212253	Molly	365	" No . I know she does n't like spending money on her dress , and is very careful . "
212267	212326	212253	212253	Molly	365	" But then she must have got the money somewhere . It always has struck me that if you have not extravagant habits , and do not live up to your income , you must have a certain sum to lay by at the end of the year . Have I not often said so , Mr. Gibson ? "
212327	212330	212222	212223	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Probably . "
212331	212358	212253	212253	Molly	365	" Well , then , apply the same reasoning to Cynthia 's case ; and then , I ask , what has become of the money ? "
212359	212365	212367	212367	Molly	365	" I can not tell , "
212376	212390	212367	212367	Molly	365	" She may have given it away to some one who wants it . "
212398	212519	212253	212253	Molly	365	" It 's very clear that she has neither got the dress nor the money necessary for this London visit , and that she does n't want any more inquiries to be made on the subject . She likes mysteries , in fact , and I detest them . Still , I think it 's a desirable thing for her to keep up the acquaintance , or friendship , or whatever it is to be called , with her father 's family ; and I shall gladly give her ten pounds ; and if that 's not enough , why , either you must help her out , or she must do without some superfluous article of dress or another . "
212520	212542	212544	212545	his wife	995	" I 'm sure there never was such a kind , dear , generous man as you are , Mr. Gibson , "
212547	212707	212544	212545	his wife	995	" To think of your being a stepfather ! and so good to my poor fatherless girl ! But , Molly my dear , I think you 'll acknowledge that you too are very fortunate in your stepmother . Are not you , love ? And what happy tete - a - tetes we shall have together when Cynthia goes to London ! I 'm not sure if I do n't get on better with you even than with her , though she is my own child ; for , as dear papa says so truly , there is a love of mystery about her ; and if I hate anything , it is the slightest concealment or reserve . Ten pounds ! Why , it will quite set her up , buy her a couple of gowns and a new bonnet , and I do n't know what all ! Dear Mr. Gibson , how generous you are ! "
212711	212714	212253	212253	Molly	365	" Pshaw ! "
212723	212731	212733	212733	Molly	365	" May I go and tell her ? "
212738	212904	212544	212545	his wife	995	" Yes , do , love . Tell her it would be so ungrateful to refuse ; and tell her that your father wishes her to go ; and tell her , too , that it would be quite wrong not to avail herself of an opening which may by - and - by be extended to the rest of the family . I am sure if they ask me which certainly they ought to do I wo n't say before they asked Cynthia , because I never think of myself , and am really the most forgiving person in the world , in forgiving slights ; but when they do ask me , which they are sure to do , I shall never be content till , by putting in a little hint here and a little hint there , I 've induced them to send you an invitation . A month or two in London would do you so much good , Molly . "
213113	213118	213120	213120	she	365	" Oh , Molly , "
213129	213141	213120	213120	she	365	" I am always so glad to have you with me ! "
213247	213268	213270	213270	Molly	365	" Do you know , I think you 'll be glad to hear what I 've got to tell you , "
213272	213288	213270	213270	Molly	365	" I think you would really like to go to London ; should n't you ? "
213289	213300	213302	213302	Cynthia	365	" Yes , but it 's of no use liking , "
213304	213334	213302	213302	Cynthia	365	" Do n't you begin about it , Molly , for the thing is settled ; and I ca n't tell you why , but I ca n't go . "
213335	213378	213270	213270	Molly	365	" It is only the money , dear . And papa has been so kind about it . He wants you to go ; he thinks you ought to keep up relationships ; and he is going to give you ten pounds . "
213379	213385	213387	213387	Cynthia	365	" How kind he is ! "
213389	213417	213387	213387	Cynthia	365	" But I ought not to take it . I wish I had known you years ago ; I should have been different to what I am . "
213418	213463	213270	213270	Molly	365	" Never mind that ! We like you as you are ; we do n't want you different . You 'll really hurt papa if you do n't take it . Why do you hesitate ? Do you think Roger wo n't like it ? "
213464	213495	213387	213387	Cynthia	365	" Roger ! no , I was n't thinking about him ! Why should he care ? I shall be there and back again before he even hears about it . "
213496	213502	213504	213504	Molly	365	" Then you will go ? "
213514	213520	213522	213522	she	365	" Yes , I will , "
213527	213572	213522	213522	she	365	" I daresay it 's not wise ; but it will be pleasant , and I 'll go . Where is Mr. Gibson ? I want to thank him . Oh , how kind he is ! Molly , you 're a lucky girl ! "
213573	213576	213578	213578	Molly	365	" I ? "
213611	213616	213618	213618	Cynthia	365	" There he is ! "
213620	213628	213618	213618	Cynthia	365	" I hear him in the hall ! "
213689	213694	213696	213696	he	238	" There , there ! "
213698	213728	213696	213696	he	238	" that 's enough , my dear ! It 's quite right you should keep up with your relations ; there 's nothing more to be said about it . "
213729	213743	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" I do think your father is the most charming man I know , "
213753	213828	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" and it 's that which always makes me so afraid of losing his good opinion , and fret so when I think he is displeased with me . And now let us think all about this London visit . It will be delightful , wo n't it ? I can make ten pounds go ever so far ; and in some ways it will be such a comfort to get out of Hollingford . "
213829	213833	213835	213835	Molly	365	" Will it ? "
213840	213906	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" Oh , yes ! You know I do n't mean that it will be a comfort to leave you ; that will be anything but a comfort . But , after all , a country town is a country town , and London is London . You need not smile at my truisms ; I 've always had a sympathy with M. de la Palisse ,
213929	214001	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" sang she , in so gay a manner that she puzzled Molly , as she often did , by her change of mood from the gloomy decision with which she had refused to accept the invitation only half an hour ago . She suddenly took Molly round the waist , and began waltzing round the room with her , to the imminent danger of the various little tables , loaded with "
214004	214062	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" as Mrs. Gibson delighted to call them with which the drawing - room was crowded . She avoided them , however , with her usual skill ; but they both stood still at last , surprised at Mrs. Gibson 's surprise , as she stood at the door , looking at the whirl going on before her .
214063	214089	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" Upon my word , I only hope you are not going crazy , both of you ! What 's all this about , pray ? "
214090	214105	214107	214107	Cynthia	365	" Only because I 'm so glad I 'm going to London , mamma , "
214111	214157	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" I 'm not sure if it 's quite the thing for an engaged young lady to be so much beside herself at the prospect of gaiety . In my time , our great pleasure in our lovers ' absence was in thinking about them . "
214158	214243	213745	213745	Cynthia	365	" I should have thought that would have given you pain , because you would have had to remember that they were away , which ought to have made you unhappy . Now , to tell you the truth , just at the moment I had forgotten all about Roger . I hope it was n't very wrong . Osborne looks as if he did all my share as well as his own of the fretting after Roger . How ill he looked yesterday ! "
214244	214247	214249	214249	Molly	365	" Yes , "
214251	214270	214249	214249	Molly	365	" I did n't know if any one besides me had noticed it . I was quite shocked . "
214271	214274	214276	214277	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ah , "
214279	214294	214296	214296	she	189	" I 'm afraid that young man wo n't live long very much afraid , "
214302	214312	214314	214314	Molly	365	" Oh , what will happen if he dies ! "
214346	214415	214417	214417	Molly	365	" Well , it would be very sad , of course , and we should all feel it very much , I 've no doubt ; for I 've always been very fond of Osborne ; in fact , before Roger became , as it were , my own flesh and blood , I liked Osborne better : but we must not forget the living , dear Molly , "
214432	214467	214417	214417	Molly	365	" Our dear good Roger would , I am sure , do all in his power to fill Osborne 's place in every way ; and his marriage need not be so long delayed . "
214468	214485	214487	214487	Cynthia	365	" Do n't speak of that in the same breath as Osborne 's life , mamma , "
214491	214562	214417	214417	Molly	365	" Why , my dear , it is a very natural thought . For poor Roger 's sake , you know , one wishes it not to be so very , very long an engagement ; and I was only answering Molly 's question , after all . One ca n't help following out one 's thoughts . People must die , you know young , as well as old . "
214563	214579	214581	214581	Cynthia	365	" If I ever suspected Roger of following out his thoughts in a similar way , "
214583	214592	214581	214581	Cynthia	365	" I 'd never speak to him again . "
214593	214599	214601	214601	Molly	365	" As if he would ! "
214608	214633	214601	214601	Molly	365	" You know he never would ; and you should n't suppose it of him , Cynthia no , not even for a moment ! "
214634	214650	214652	214653	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I ca n't see the great harm of it all , for my part , "
214657	214778	214652	214653	Mrs. Gibson	189	" A young man strikes us all as looking very ill and I 'm sure I 'm sorry for it ; but illness very often leads to death . Surely you agree with me there , and what 's the harm of saying so ? Then Molly asks what will happen if he dies ; and I try to answer her question . I do n't like talking or thinking of death any more than any one else ; but I should think myself wanting in strength of mind if I could not look forward to the consequences of death . I really think we 're commanded to do so , somewhere in the Bible or the Prayer - book . "
214779	214793	214795	214795	Cynthia	365	" Do you look forward to the consequences of my death , mamma ? "
214797	214810	214812	214813	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You really are the most unfeeling girl I ever met with , "
214818	214966	214812	214813	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I wish I could give you a little of my own sensitiveness , for I have too much for my happiness . Do n't let us speak of Osborne 's looks again ; ten to one it was only some temporary over - fatigue , or some anxiety about Roger , or perhaps a little fit of indigestion . I was very foolish to attribute it to anything more serious , and dear papa might be displeased if he knew I had done so . Medical men do n't like other people to be making conjectures about health ; they consider it as trenching on their own particular province , and very proper , I 'm sure . Now let us consider about your dress , Cynthia ; I could not understand how you had spent your money , and made so little show with it . "
214967	215023	215024	215024	She	5033	" Mamma ! it may sound very cross , but I must tell Molly , and you , and everybody , once for all , that as I do n't want and did n't ask for more than my allowance , I 'm not going to answer any questions about what I do with it . "
215161	215173	215136	215136	mother	6895	" gar auld claes look amaist as weel 's the new . "
215234	215244	215246	215246	he	1206	" She 's a pretty lass , sure enough , "
215248	215533	215246	215246	he	1206	" and has pretty ways about her too , and likes to learn from older people , which is a good sign ; but somehow I do n't like madam her mother ; but still she is her mother , and the girl 's her daughter ; yet she spoke to her once or twice as I should n't ha ' liked our little Fanny to have spoken , if it had pleased God for her to ha ' lived . No , it 's not the right way , and it may be a bit old - fashioned , but I like the right way . And then again she took possession o ' me , as I may say , and little Molly had to run after us in the garden walks that are too narrow for three , just like a little four - legged doggie ; and the other was so full of listening to me , she never turned round for to speak a word to Molly . I do n't mean to say they 're not fond of each other , and that 's in Roger 's sweetheart 's favour ; and it 's very ungrateful in me to go and find fault with a lass who was so civil to me , and had such a pretty way with her of hanging on every word that fell from my lips . Well ! a deal may come and go in two years ! and the lad says nothing to me about it . I 'll be as deep as him , and take no more notice of the affair till he comes home and tells me himself . "
215693	215701	215687	215687	she	365	" there was no harm in it . "
215949	215955	215957	215958	the Squire	1206	" It was a mistake , "
215960	216206	215957	215958	the Squire	1206	" I see it now . I was never great at making friends myself : I always thought those Oxford and Cambridge men turned up their noses at me for a country booby , and I 'd get the start and have none o ' them . But when the boys went to Rugby and Cambridge , I should ha ' let them have had their own friends about 'em , even though they might ha ' looked down on me ; it was the worst they could ha ' done to me ; and now what few friends I had have fallen off from me , by death or somehow , and it is but dreary work for a young man , I grant it . But he might try not to show it so plain to me as he does . I 'm getting case - hardened , but it does cut me to the quick sometimes it does . And he so fond of his dad as he was once ! If I can but get the land drained I 'll make him an allowance , and let him go to London , or where he likes . Maybe he 'll do better this time , or maybe he 'll go to the dogs altogether ; but perhaps it will make him think a bit kindly of the old father at home I should like him to do that , I should ! "
216729	216744	216726	216726	he	1206	" Osborne ! Do you know anything about this this attachment of Roger 's ? "
216764	216792	216795	216795	he	1206	" Roger ! an attachment ! No ! I never heard of it I can hardly believe it that is to say , I suppose it is to "
216817	216861	216795	216795	he	1206	" Yes . He is though . Can you guess who to ? Nobody that I particularly like not a connection to my mind yet she 's a very pretty girl ; and I suppose I was to blame in the first instance . "
216862	216866	216795	216795	he	1206	" Is it ? "
216867	216909	216795	216795	he	1206	" It 's no use beating about the bush . I 've gone so far , I may as well tell you all . It 's Miss Kirkpatrick , Gibson 's stepdaughter . But it 's not an engagement , mind you "
216910	216922	216795	216795	he	1206	" I 'm very glad I hope she likes Roger back again "
216923	216962	216795	216795	he	1206	" Like it 's only too good a connection for her not to like it : if Roger is of the same mind when he comes home , I 'll be bound she 'll be only too happy ! "
216963	216971	216973	216973	Osborne	174	" I wonder Roger never told me , "
216986	216993	216995	216996	the Squire	1206	" He never told me either , "
216998	217105	216995	216996	the Squire	1206	" It was Gibson , who came here , and made a clean breast of it , like a man of honour . I 'd been saying to him , I could n't have either of you two lads taking up with his lasses . I 'll own it was you I was afraid of it 's bad enough with Roger , and maybe will come to nothing after all ; but if it had been you , I 'd ha ' broken with Gibson and every mother 's son of 'em , sooner than have let it go on ; and so I told Gibson . "
217106	217139	217141	217141	Osborne	174	" I beg your pardon for interrupting you , but , once for all , I claim the right of choosing my wife for myself , subject to no man 's interference , "
217145	217274	216995	216996	the Squire	1206	" Then you 'll keep your wife with no man 's interference , that 's all ; for ne'er a penny will you get from me , my lad , unless you marry to please me a little , as well as yourself a great deal . That 's all I ask of you . I 'm not particular as to beauty , or as to cleverness , and piano - playing , and that sort of thing ; if Roger marries this girl , we shall have enough of that in the family . I should n't much mind her being a bit older than you , but she must be well - born , and the more money she brings the better for the old place . "
217275	217301	217317	217317	his	1206	" I say again , father , I choose my wife for myself , and I do n't admit any man 's right of dictation . "
217302	217307	217309	217310	the Squire	1206	" Well , well ! "
217320	217397	217309	217310	the Squire	1206	" If I 'm not to be father in this matter , thou sha'n't be son . Go against me in what I 've set my heart on , and you 'll find there 's the devil to pay , that 's all . But do n't let us get angry , it 's Sunday afternoon for one thing , and it 's a sin ; and besides that , I 've not finished my story . "
217430	217484	217418	217418	He	1206	" As I was saying , Gibson said , when first we spoke about it , that there was nothing on foot between any of you four , and that if there was , he would let me know ; so by - and - by he comes and tells me of this . "
217485	217498	217504	217504	Osborne	174	" Of what I do n't understand how far it has gone ? "
217521	217579	217418	217418	He	1206	" Of this , to be sure of what I 'm telling you of Roger going and making love to this girl , that day he left , after he had gone away from here , and was waiting for the ' Umpire ' in Hollingford . One would think you quite stupid at times , Osborne . "
217580	217604	217418	217418	He	1206	" I can only say that these details are quite new to me ; you never mentioned them before , I assure you . "
217605	217648	217418	217418	He	1206	" Well ; never mind whether I did or not . I 'm sure I said Roger was attached to Miss Kirkpatrick , and be hanged to her ; and you might have understood all the rest as a matter of course . "
217649	217652	217654	217654	Osborne	174	" Possibly , "
217658	217683	217654	217654	Osborne	174	" May I ask if Miss Kirkpatrick , who appeared to me to be a very nice girl , responds to Roger 's affection ? "
217684	217693	217695	217696	the Squire	1206	" Fast enough , I 'll be bound , "
217700	217763	217695	217696	the Squire	1206	" A Hamley of Hamley is n't to be had every day . Now , I 'll tell you what , Osborne , you 're the only marriageable one left in the market , and I want to hoist the old family up again . Do n't go against me in this ; it really will break my heart if you do . "
217764	217772	217774	217774	Osborne	174	" Father , do n't talk so , "
217776	217788	217774	217774	Osborne	174	" I 'll do anything I can to oblige you , except "
217789	217803	217695	217696	the Squire	1206	" Except the only thing I 've set my heart on your doing . "
217804	217865	217774	217774	Osborne	174	" Well , well , let it alone for the present . There 's no question of my marrying just at this moment . I 'm out of health , and I 'm not up to going into society , and meeting young ladies and all that sort of thing , even if I had an opening into fitting society . "
217866	217930	217695	217696	the Squire	1206	" You should have an opening fast enough . There 'll be more money coming in , in a year or two , please God . And as for your health , why , what 's to make you well , if you cower over the fire all day , and shudder away from a good honest tankard as if it were poison ? "
217931	217938	217940	217940	Osborne	174	" So it is to me , "
217972	217975	217977	217977	he	5089	" Well , "
217979	218011	217977	217977	he	5089	" I 'll go and have a talk with Will about poor old Black Bess . It 's Sunday work enough , asking after a dumb animal 's aches and pains . "
218402	218437	218385	218385	he	5089	" Cynthia I may call you Cynthia now , may n't I ? I 'm so glad of this news ; I 've only just heard of it , but I 'm so glad ! "
218438	218445	218446	218446	She	252	" What news do you mean ? "
218495	218506	218507	218507	she	252	" Why are you to begin calling me Cynthia now ? "
218513	218530	218507	218507	she	252	" The terrible word has slipped out from between your lips before , do you know ? "
218598	218712	218572	218572	she	252	" I think I can guess why you made that pretty little speech just now . But do you know you ought not to have been told ? And , moreover , things are not quite arrived at the solemnity of of well an engagement . He would not have it so . Now , I sha'n't say any more ; and you must not . Pray remember you ought not to have known ; it is my own secret , and I particularly wished it not to be spoken about ; and I do n't like its being so talked about . Oh , the leaking of water through one small hole ! "
218834	218841	218843	218844	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You poor dear young man , "
218857	218951	218843	218844	Mrs. Gibson	189	" how tired you look ! Do take some of that eau - de - Cologne and bathe your forehead . This spring weather overcomes me too . ' Primavera ' I think the Italians call it . But it is very trying for delicate constitutions , as much from its associations as from its variableness of temperature . It makes me sigh perpetually ; but then I am so sensitive . Dear Lady Cumnor always used to say I was like a thermometer . You 've heard how ill she has been ? "
218952	218955	218957	218957	Osborne	174	" No , "
218965	219014	218843	218844	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , yes , she is better now ; but the anxiety about her has tried me so : detained here by what are , of course , my duties , but far away from all intelligence , and not knowing what the next post might bring . "
219015	219021	219023	219023	Osborne	174	" Where was she then ? "
219031	219070	218843	218844	Mrs. Gibson	189	" At Spa . Such a distance off ! Three days ' post ! Ca n't you conceive the trial ? Living with her as I did for years ; bound up in the family as I was . "
219071	219096	219098	219098	Molly	365	" But Lady Harriet said , in her last letter , that they hoped she would be stronger than she had been for years , "
219102	219161	218843	218844	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes Lady Harriet of course every one who knows Lady Harriet knows that she is of too sanguine a temperament for her statements to be perfectly relied on . Altogether strangers are often deluded by Lady Harriet she has an off - hand manner which takes them in ; but she does not mean half she says . "
219162	219172	219174	219174	Cynthia	365	" We will hope she does in this instance , "
219178	219195	219174	219174	Cynthia	365	" They 're in London now , and Lady Cumnor has n't suffered from the journey . "
219196	219201	219203	219204	Mrs. Gibson	189	" They say so , "
219220	219221	219207	219207	her	189	" "
219336	219336	219314	219314	You	365	"
219509	219666	219681	219681	Cynthia	365	" We 'll have bread - and - cheese for dinner , and eat it on our knees ; we 'll make up for having had to eat sloppy puddings with a fork instead of a spoon all this time , by putting our knives in our mouths till we cut ourselves . Papa shall pour his tea into his saucer if he 's in a hurry ; and if I 'm thirsty , I 'll take the slop - basin . And oh , if I could but get , buy , borrow , or steal any kind of an old horse ; my grey skirt is n't new , but it will do ; that would be too delightful ! After all , I think I can be happy again ; for months and months it has seemed as if I had got too old ever to feel pleasure , much less happiness again . "
219693	219710	219681	219681	Cynthia	365	" Molly , you 're very glad to get rid of us , are not you ? "
219711	219756	219681	219681	Cynthia	365	" Not of you , Cynthia ; at least , I do n't think I am . Only , if you but knew how I love papa , and how I used to see a great deal more of him than I ever do now "
219757	219773	219681	219681	Cynthia	365	" Ah ! I often think what interlopers we must seem , and are in fact "
219774	219811	219681	219681	Cynthia	365	" I do n't feel you as such . You , at any rate , have been a new delight to me a sister ; and I never knew how charming such a relationship could be . "
219812	219816	219818	219818	Cynthia	365	" But mamma ? "
219828	219835	219837	219837	Molly	147	" She is papa 's wife , "
219841	219867	219837	219837	Molly	147	" I do n't mean to say I 'm not often very sorry to feel I 'm no longer first with him ; but it was "
219915	219920	219921	219921	she	147	" it was Roger ! "
219939	219981	219921	219921	she	147	" Roger , who told me how I ought to take papa 's marriage , when I was first startled and grieved at the news . Oh , Cynthia , what a great thing it is to be loved by him ! "
219991	220039	219921	219921	she	147	" Yes , I suppose it is . At the same time , Molly , I 'm afraid he 'll expect me to be always as good as he fancies me now , and I shall have to walk on tiptoe all the rest of my life . "
220040	220048	220051	220051	Molly	147	" But you are good , Cynthia , "
220053	220097	219921	219921	she	147	" No , I 'm not . You 're just as much mistaken as he is ; and some day I shall go down in your opinions with a run , just like the hall clock the other day when the spring broke . "
220098	220109	220111	220111	Molly	147	" I think he 'll love you just as much , "
220113	220152	220153	220153	she	147	" Could you ? Would you be my friend if if it turned out ever that I had done very wrong things ? Would you remember how very difficult it has sometimes been to me to act rightly ? "
220164	220262	220264	220264	she	147	" We wo n't speak of mamma , for your sake as much as mine or hers ; but you must see she is n't one to help a girl with much good advice , or good Oh , Molly , you do n't know how I was neglected just at a time when I wanted friends most . Mamma does not know it ; it is not in her to know what I might have been if I had only fallen into wise , good hands . But I know it ; and what 's more , "
220275	220307	220264	220264	she	147	" I try not to care , which I daresay is really the worst of all ; but I could worry myself to death if I once took to serious thinking . "
220308	220321	220323	220323	Molly	147	" I wish I could help you , or even understand you , "
220334	220340	220342	220342	Cynthia	365	" You can help me , "
220349	220414	220342	220342	Cynthia	365	" I can trim bonnets , and make head - dresses ; but somehow my hands ca n't fold up gowns and collars , like your deft little fingers . Please will you help me to pack ? That 's a real , tangible piece of kindness , and not sentimental consolation for sentimental distresses , which are , perhaps , imaginary after all . "
220486	220488	220469	220469	Molly	147	" Umpire "
220498	220503	220505	220505	she	147	" Now , papa ! "
220507	220528	220505	220505	she	147	" I 'm going to have you all to myself for a whole week . You must be very obedient . "
220529	220556	220469	220469	Molly	147	" Do n't be tyrannical , then . You 're walking me out of breath , and we 're cutting Mrs. Goodenough , in our hurry . "
220569	220593	220505	220505	she	147	" We 've just been seeing my wife and her daughter off to London . Mrs. Gibson has gone up for a week ! "
220594	220637	220505	220505	she	147	" Deary , deary , to London , and only for a week ! Why , I can remember its being a three days ' journey ! It 'll be very lonesome for you , Miss Molly , without your young companion ! "
220638	220641	220643	220643	Molly	147	" Yes ! "
220660	220668	220649	220649	she	147	" I shall miss Cynthia very much . "
220669	220716	220505	220505	she	147	" And you , Mr. Gibson ; why , it 'll be like being a widower over again ! You must come and drink tea with me some evening . We must try and cheer you up a bit amongst us . Shall it be Tuesday ? "
220745	220785	220505	220505	she	147	" Papa , how could you go and waste one of our evenings ! We have but six in all , and now but five ; and I had so reckoned on our doing all sorts of things together . "
220786	220792	220821	220821	His	675	" What sort of things ? "
220793	220808	220810	220810	she	147	" Oh , I do n't know : everything that is unrefined and ungenteel , "
220835	220866	220829	220829	his	675	" I 'm not going to be corrupted . With toil and labour I 've reached a very fair height of refinement . I wo n't be pulled down again . "
220867	220943	220821	220821	His	675	" Yes , you will , papa . We 'll have bread - and - cheese for lunch this very day . And you shall wear your slippers in the drawing - room every evening you 'll stay quietly at home ; and oh , papa , do n't you think I could ride Nora Creina ? I 've been looking out the old grey skirt , and I think I could make myself tidy . "
220944	220955	220829	220829	his	675	" Where is the side - saddle to come from ? "
220956	220987	220821	220821	His	675	" To be sure , the old one wo n't fit that great Irish mare . But I 'm not particular , papa . I think I could manage somehow . "
220988	221021	220829	220829	his	675	" Thank you . But I 'm not quite going to return into barbarism . It may be a depraved taste , but I should like to see my daughter properly mounted . "
221022	221084	220821	220821	His	675	" Think of riding together down the lanes why , the dog - roses must be all out in flower , and the honeysuckles , and the hay how I should like to see Merriman 's farm again ! Papa , do let me have one ride with you ! Please do . I 'm sure we can manage it somehow . "
221088	221093	220829	220829	his	675	" it was managed . "
221095	221248	220829	220829	his	675	" all Molly 's wishes came to pass ; there was only one little drawback to this week of holiday and happy intercourse with her father . Everybody would ask them out to tea . They were quite like bride and bridegroom ; for the fact was , that the late dinners which Mrs. Gibson had introduced into her own house , were a great inconvenience in the calculations of the small tea - drinkings at Hollingford . How ask people to tea at six , who dined at that hour ? How , when they refused cake and sandwiches at half - past eight , how induce other people who were really hungry to commit a vulgarity before those calm and scornful eyes ? So there had been a great lull of invitations for the Gibsons to Hollingford tea - parties . Mrs. Gibson , whose object was to squeeze herself into "
221252	221664	220829	220829	his	675	" had taken this being left out of the smaller festivities with great equanimity ; but Molly missed the kind homeliness of the parties to which she had gone from time to time as long as she could remember ; and though , as each three - cornered note was brought in , she grumbled a little over the loss of another charming evening with her father , she really was glad to go again in the old way among old friends . Miss Browning and Miss Phobe were especially compassionate towards her in her loneliness . If they had had their will she would have dined there every day ; and she had to call upon them very frequently in order to prevent their being hurt at her declining the dinners . Mrs. Gibson wrote twice during her week 's absence to her husband . That piece of news was quite satisfactory to the Miss Brownings , who had of late held themselves a great deal aloof from a house where they chose to suppose that their presence was not wanted . In their winter evenings they had often talked over Mr. Gibson 's household , and having little besides conjecture to go upon , they found the subject interminable , as they could vary the possibilities every day . One of their wonders was how Mr. and Mrs. Gibson really got on together ; another was whether Mrs. Gibson was extravagant or not . Now two letters during the week of her absence showed what was in those days considered a very proper amount of conjugal affection . Yet not too much at elevenpence - halfpenny postage . A third letter would have been extravagant . Sister looked to sister with an approving nod as Molly named the second letter , which arrived in Hollingford the very day before Mrs. Gibson was to return . They had settled between themselves that two letters would show the right amount of good feeling and proper understanding in the Gibson family : more would have been extravagant ; only one would have been a mere matter of duty . There had been rather a question between Miss Browning and Miss Phobe as to which person the second letter supposing it came was to be addressed to . It would be very conjugal to write twice to Mr. Gibson ; and yet it would be very pretty if Molly came in for her share .
221665	221678	221680	221681	Miss Browning	159	" You 've had another letter , you say , my dear ? "
221683	221695	221680	221681	Miss Browning	159	" I daresay Mrs. Gibson has written to you this time ? "
221696	221721	220829	220829	his	675	" It is a large sheet , and Cynthia has written on one half to me , and all the rest is to papa . "
221722	221743	221680	221681	Miss Browning	159	" A very nice arrangement , I 'm sure . And what does Cynthia say ? Is she enjoying herself ? "
221744	221782	220829	220829	his	675	" Oh , yes , I think so . They 've had a dinner - party ; and one night , when mamma was at Lady Cumnor 's , Cynthia went to the play with her cousins . "
221783	221853	221680	221681	Miss Browning	159	" Upon my word ! and all in one week ? I do call that dissipation . Why , Thursday would be taken up with the journey , and Friday with resting , and Sunday is Sunday all the world over ; and they must have written on Tuesday . Well ! I hope Cynthia wo n't find Hollingford dull , that 's all , when she comes back . "
221854	221863	221865	221866	Miss Phobe	159	" I do n't think it 's likely , "
221886	221902	221865	221866	Miss Phobe	159	" You see a great deal of Mr. Preston , do n't you , Molly ? "
221903	221907	221909	221909	Molly	365	" Mr. Preston ! "
221916	221950	221909	221909	Molly	365	" No ! not much . He 's been at Ashcombe all winter , you know ! He has but just come back to settle here . What should make you think so ? "
221951	221960	221962	221963	Miss Browning	159	" Oh ! a little bird told us , "
222035	222100	222025	222026	Miss Phobe	159	" The little bird was flying about one day in Heath Lane , and it saw Mr. Preston and a young lady we wo n't say who walking together in a very friendly manner , that is to say , he was on horseback ; but the path is raised above the road , just where there is the little wooden bridge over the brook "
222101	222119	222121	222122	Miss Phobe	159	" Perhaps Molly is in the secret , and we ought not to ask her about it , "
222132	222140	222142	222143	Miss Browning	159	" It can be no great secret , "
222165	222176	222160	222161	Miss Phobe	159	" for Miss Hornblower says Mr. Preston owns to being engaged "
222177	222192	222194	222194	Molly	365	" At any rate it is n't to Cynthia , that I know positively , "
222199	222229	222194	222194	Molly	365	" And pray put a stop to any such reports ; you do n't know what mischief they may do . I do so hate that kind of chatter ! "
222282	222329	222398	222398	she	147	" Heighty - teighty ! Miss Molly ! do n't you remember that I am old enough to be your mother , and that it is not pretty behaviour to speak so to us to me ! ' Chatter ' to be sure . Really , Molly "
222330	222336	222338	222338	Molly	147	" I beg your pardon , "
222345	222358	222360	222361	Miss Phobe	159	" I daresay you did not mean to speak so to sister , "
222390	222397	222398	222398	she	147	" But do n't you see , "
222407	222454	222398	222398	she	147	" how bad it is to talk of such things in such a way ? Supposing one of them cared for some one else , and that might happen , you know ; Mr. Preston , for instance , may be engaged to some one else ? "
222455	222477	222479	222480	Miss Browning	159	" Molly ! I pity the woman ! Indeed I do . I have a very poor opinion of Mr. Preston , "
222499	222521	222398	222398	she	147	" Well , but the woman , or young lady , would not like to hear such reports about Mr. Preston . "
222522	222556	222398	222398	she	147	" Perhaps not . But for all that , take my word for it , he 's a great flirt , and young ladies had better not have much to do with him . "
222557	222570	222572	222573	Miss Phobe	159	" I daresay it was all accident their meeting in Heath Lane , "
222575	222582	222584	222584	Molly	147	" I know nothing about it , "
222586	222613	222584	222584	Molly	147	" and I daresay I have been impertinent , only please do n't talk about it any more . I have my reasons for asking you . "
222667	222675	222677	222678	Miss Phobe	159	" How you are growing , Molly ! "
222689	222709	222677	222678	Miss Phobe	159	" ' As tall and as straight as a poplar - tree ! ' as the old song says . "
222710	222724	222726	222727	Miss Browning	159	" Grow in grace , Molly , as well as in good looks ! "
222771	222795	222763	222763	she	159	" Phobe , it was Molly herself that was with Mr. Preston in Heath Lane that day when Mrs. Goodenough saw them together ! "
222796	222801	222803	222804	Miss Phobe	159	" Gracious goodness me ! "
222813	222819	222763	222763	she	159	" How do you know ? "
222820	222860	222763	222763	she	159	" By putting two and two together . Did n't you notice how red Molly went , and then pale , and how she said she knew for a fact that Mr. Preston and Cynthia Kirkpatrick were not engaged ? "
222861	222880	222763	222763	she	159	" Perhaps not engaged ; but Mrs. Goodenough saw them loitering together , all by their own two selves "
222881	222901	222903	222904	Miss Browning	159	" Mrs. Goodenough only crossed Heath Lane at the Shire Oak , as she was riding in her phaeton , "
222907	223021	222903	222904	Miss Browning	159	" We all know what a coward she is in a carriage , so that most likely she had only half her wits about her , and her eyes are none of the best when she is standing steady on the ground . Molly and Cynthia have got their new plaid shawls just alike , and they trim their bonnets alike , and Molly is grown as tall as Cynthia since Christmas . I was always afraid she 'd be short and stumpy , but she 's now as tall and slender as anyone need be . I 'll answer for it , Mrs. Goodenough saw Molly , and took her for Cynthia . "
223025	223029	223030	223031	Miss Phobe	159	" answered for it "
223050	223065	223047	223047	she	159	" It would n't be such a very bad match after all , sister . "
223080	223114	223047	223047	she	159	" Phobe , it would be a bad match for Mary Pearson 's daughter . If I had known what I know now we 'd never have had him to tea last September . "
223115	223123	223125	223126	Miss Phobe	159	" Why , what do you know ? "
223128	223198	223047	223047	she	159	" Miss Hornblower told me many things ; some that I do n't think you ought to hear , Phobe . He was engaged to a very pretty Miss Gregson , at Henwick , where he comes from ; and her father made inquiries , and heard so much that was bad about him that he made his daughter break off the match , and she 's dead since ! "
223199	223203	223205	223206	Miss Phobe	159	" How shocking ! "
223211	223236	223047	223047	she	159	" Besides , he plays at billiards , and he bets at races , and some people do say he keeps race - horses . "
223237	223253	223047	223047	she	159	" But is n't it strange that the earl keeps him on as his agent ? "
223254	223304	223047	223047	she	159	" No ! perhaps not . He 's very clever about land , and very sharp in all law affairs ; and my lord is n't bound to take notice if indeed he knows of the manner in which Mr. Preston talks when he has taken too much wine . "
223305	223328	223047	223047	she	159	" Taken too much wine ! Oh , sister , is he a drunkard ? and we have had him to tea ! "
223329	223341	223343	223344	Miss Browning	159	" I did n't say he was a drunkard , Phobe , "
223348	223376	223343	223344	Miss Browning	159	" A man may take too much wine occasionally , without being a drunkard . Do n't let me hear you using such coarse words , Phobe ! "
223392	223402	223389	223389	she	159	" I do hope it was n't Molly Gibson . "
223403	223558	223389	223389	she	159	" You may hope as much as you like , but I 'm pretty sure it was . However , we 'd better say nothing about it to Mrs. Goodenough ; she has got Cynthia into her head , and there let her rest . Time enough to set reports afloat about Molly when we know there 's some truth in them . Mr. Preston might do for Cynthia , who 's been brought up in France , though she has such pretty manners ; but it may have made her not particular . He must not , and he shall not , have Molly , if I go into church and forbid the banns myself ; but I 'm afraid I 'm afraid there 's something between her and him . We must keep on the look - out , Phobe . I 'll be her guardian angel , in spite of herself . "
223605	223618	223621	223621	his	5132	" Lady Harriet charming and devoted to her old governess , Lord Cumnor "
223627	223714	223621	223621	his	5132	" and as for the Kirkpatricks , no Lord Chancellor 's house was ever grander than theirs , and the silk gown of the Q.C. had floated over housemaids and footmen . Cynthia , too , was so much admired ; and as for her dress , Mrs. Kirkpatrick had showered down ball - dresses and wreaths , and pretty bonnets and mantles , like a fairy godmother . Mr. Gibson 's poor present of ten pounds shrank into very small dimensions compared with all this munificence .
223715	223735	223737	223738	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And they 're so fond of her , I do n't know when we shall have her back , "
223745	223837	223838	223838	she	189	" And now , Molly , what have you and papa been doing ? Very gay , you sounded in your letter . I had not time to read it in London ; so I put it in my pocket , and read it in the coach coming home . But , my dear child , you do look so old - fashioned with your gown made all tight , and your hair all tumbling about in curls . Curls are quite gone out . We must do your hair differently , "
223851	223859	223861	223861	Molly	147	" I sent Cynthia an African letter , "
223865	223876	223861	223861	Molly	147	" Did you hear anything of what was in it ? "
223877	223977	223838	223838	she	189	" Oh , yes , poor child ! It made her very uneasy , I think ; she said she did not feel inclined to go to Mr. Rawson 's ball , which was on that night , and for which Mrs. Kirkpatrick had given her the ball - dress . But there was really nothing for her to fidget herself about . Roger only said he had had another touch of fever , but was better when he wrote . He says every European has to be acclimatized by fever in that part of Abyssinia where he is . "
223978	223984	223986	223986	Molly	147	" And did she go ? "
223988	224074	223838	223838	she	189	" Yes , to be sure . It is not an engagement ; and if it were , it is not acknowledged . Fancy her going and saying , ' A young man that I know has been ill for a few days in Africa , two months ago , therefore I do n't want to go to the ball to - night . ' It would have seemed like affectation of sentiment ; and if there 's one thing I hate it is that . "
224075	224082	224084	224084	Molly	147	" She would hardly enjoy herself , "
224086	224152	223838	223838	she	189	" Oh , yes , but she did . Her dress was white gauze , trimmed with lilacs , and she really did look a mother may be allowed a little natural partiality most lovely . And she danced every dance , although she was quite a stranger . I am sure she enjoyed herself , from her manner of talking about it next morning . "
224153	224161	223838	223838	she	189	" I wonder if the Squire knows . "
224162	224204	224206	224206	she	147	" Knows what ? Oh , yes , to be sure you mean about Roger . I daresay he does n't , and there 's no need to tell him , for I 've no doubt it is all right now . "
224226	224302	224217	224217	Molly	147	" It will be a year the day after to - morrow since he came here to propose our going to Hurst Wood , and mamma was so vexed at his calling before lunch . I wonder if Cynthia remembers it as well as I do . And now , perhaps Oh ! Roger , Roger ! I wish I pray that you were safe home again ! How could we all bear it , if "
224330	224374	224318	224318	she	147	" I do n't believe she loves him as she ought , or she could not could not have gone and danced . What shall I do if she does not ? What shall I do ? I can bear anything but that . "
224660	224851	224613	224615	the right callers	5144	" When I look back to those happy days , it seems to me as if I had never valued them as I ought . To be sure youth , love , what did we care for poverty ! I remember dear Mr. Kirkpatrick walking five miles into Stratford to buy me a muffin because I had such a fancy for one after Cynthia was born . I do n't mean to complain of dear papa but I do n't think but , perhaps I ought not to say it to you . If Mr. Kirkpatrick had but taken care of that cough of his ; but he was so obstinate ! Men always are , I think . And it really was selfish of him . Only I daresay he did not consider the forlorn state in which I should be left . It came harder upon me than upon most people , because I always was of such an affectionate sensitive nature . I remember a little poem of Mr. Kirkpatrick 's , in which he compared my heart to a harpstring , vibrating to the slightest breeze . "
224852	224866	224868	224868	Molly	147	" I thought harpstrings required a pretty strong finger to make them sound , "
224870	224916	224613	224615	the right callers	5144	" My dear child , you 've no more poetry in you than your father . And as for your hair ! it 's worse than ever . Ca n't you drench it in water to take those untidy twists and twirls out of it ? "
224917	224931	224933	224933	Molly	147	" It only makes it curl more and more when it gets dry , "
225071	225239	225057	225058	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Mrs. Green ! ah , that 's Mr. Jones 's pretty cousin , who lives in Russell Square with the fat husband . They keep their carriage ; but I 'm not sure if it is not Mr. Green who is Mrs. Jones 's cousin . We can ask Cynthia when she comes home . Mr. Henderson ! to be sure a young man with black whiskers , a pupil of Mr. Kirkpatrick 's formerly , or was he a pupil of Mr. Murray 's ? I know they said he had read law with somebody . Ah , yes ! they are the people who called the day after Mr. Rawson 's ball , and who admired Cynthia so much , without knowing I was her mother . She was very handsomely dressed indeed , in black satin ; and the son had a glass eye , but he was a young man of good property . Coleman ! yes , that was the name . "
225686	225690	225679	225679	She	147	" poor Roger , "
225846	225856	225858	225858	Molly	147	" What is it ? may I see it ? "
225884	225907	225909	225909	she	147	" Certainly ; I do n't suppose there are any great secrets in a scientific journal , full of reports of meetings . "
225919	225924	225926	225926	Molly	147	" Oh , Cynthia ! "
225935	225941	225926	225926	Molly	147	" are you not proud ? "
226094	226209	226239	226239	her	5165	" I 'm afraid I 'm not as much struck by the wonder of the thing as you are , Molly . Besides , it is not news to me ; at least , not entirely . I heard about the meeting before I left London ; it was a good deal talked about in my uncle 's set ; to be sure , I did n't hear all the fine things they say of him there but then , you know , that 's a mere fashion of speaking , which means nothing ; somebody is bound to pay compliments when a lord takes the trouble to read one of his letters aloud . "
226210	226213	226215	226215	Molly	147	" Nonsense , "
226217	226231	226215	226215	Molly	147	" You know you do n't believe what you are saying , Cynthia . "
226271	226276	226277	226277	she	147	" Why , Cynthia ! "
226280	226329	226277	226277	she	147	" you might have been there ; ladies were there . It says ' many ladies were present . ' Oh , could n't you have managed to go ? If your uncle 's set cared about these things , would n't some of them have taken you ? "
226330	226355	226239	226239	her	5165	" Perhaps , if I had asked them . But I think they would have been rather astonished at my sudden turn for science . "
226356	226393	226277	226277	she	147	" You might have told your uncle how matters really stood , he would n't have talked about it if you had wished him not , I am sure , and he could have helped you . "
226394	226401	226403	226403	Cynthia	247	" Once for all , Molly , "
226417	226541	226403	226403	Cynthia	247	" do learn to understand that it is , and always has been my wish , not to have the relation which Roger and I bear to each other , mentioned or talked about . When the right time comes , I will make it known to my uncle , and to everybody whom it may concern ; but I am not going to make mischief , and get myself into trouble even for the sake of hearing compliments paid to him by letting it out before the time . If I 'm pushed to it , I 'd sooner break it off altogether at once , and have done with it . I ca n't be worse off than I am now . "
226567	226576	226577	226577	she	5166	" I ca n't understand you , Cynthia , "
226582	226591	226593	226593	Cynthia	247	" No ; I daresay you ca n't , "
226617	226627	226593	226593	Cynthia	247	" I am afraid I hope you never will . "
226639	226644	226645	226645	she	147	" Oh , Cynthia , "
226648	226692	226645	226645	she	147	" have I been plaguing you ? Have I vexed you ? Do n't say you 're afraid of my knowing you . Of course you 've your faults , everybody has , but I think I love you the better for them . "
226693	226705	226707	226707	Cynthia	247	" I do n't know that I am so very bad , "
226729	226799	226707	226707	Cynthia	247	" But I have got into scrapes . I 'm in a scrape now . I do sometimes believe I shall always be in scrapes , and if they ever come to light , I shall seem to be worse than I really am ; and I know your father will throw me off , and I no , I wo n't be afraid that you will , Molly . "
226800	226819	226821	226821	Molly	147	" I 'm sure I wo n't . Are they do you think how would Roger take it ? "
226826	226888	226889	226889	Molly	147	" I do n't know . I hope he will never hear of it . I do n't see why he should , for in a little while I shall be quite clear again . It all came about without my ever thinking I was doing wrong . I 've a great mind to tell you all about it , Molly . "
227085	227092	227073	227074	Mrs. Gibson	189	" between three and four shillings . "
227122	227131	227111	227111	Hollingford	188	" dear Helen 's enthusiastic friendship for Cynthia , "
227134	227161	227111	227111	Hollingford	188	" the real pleasure it was to receive such constant news relays of news indeed from London . It was almost as good as living there ! "
227162	227171	227173	227174	Miss Browning	159	" A great deal better I should think , "
227302	227307	227299	227299	Cynthia	247	" in the world , "
227309	227321	227299	227299	Cynthia	247	" beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of London , "
227379	227389	227391	227392	Miss Browning	159	" As far as I can judge of London , "
227402	227809	227391	227392	Miss Browning	159	" it 's no better than a pickpocket and a robber dressed up in the spoils of honest folk . I should like to know where my Lord Hollingford was bred , and Mr. Roger Hamley . Your good husband lent me that report of the meeting , Mrs. Gibson , where so much was said about them both , and he was as proud of their praises as if he had been akin to them , and Phobe read it aloud to me , for the print was too small for my eyes ; she was a good deal perplexed with all the new names of places , but I said she had better skip them all , for we had never heard of them before and probably should never hear of them again , but she read out the fine things they said of my lord , and Mr. Roger , and I put it to you , where were they born and bred ? Why , within eight miles of Hollingford ; it might have been Molly there or me ; it 's all a chance ; and then they go and talk about the pleasures of intellectual society in London , and the distinguished people up there that it is such an advantage to know , and all the time I know it 's only shops and the play that 's the real attraction . But that 's neither here nor there . We all put our best foot foremost , and if we have a reason to give that looks sensible we speak it out like men , and never say anything about the silliness we are hugging to our hearts . But I ask you again , where does this fine society come from , and these wise men , and these distinguished travellers ? Why , out of country parishes like this ! London picks 'em all up , and decks herself with them , and then calls out loud to the folks she 's robbed , and says , ' Come and see how fine I am . ' Fine , indeed ! I 've no patience with London : Cynthia is much better out of it ; and I 'm not sure , if I were you , Mrs. Gibson , if I would n't stop up those London letters : they 'll only be unsettling her . "
227810	227826	227828	227829	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But perhaps she may live in London some of these days , Miss Browning , "
227831	227873	227875	227875	she	189	" Time enough then to be thinking of London . I wish her an honest country husband with enough to live upon , and a little to lay by , and a good character to boot . Mind that , Molly , "
227884	227954	227875	227875	she	189	" I wish Cynthia a husband with a good character ; but she 's got a mother to look after her ; you 've none , and when your mother was alive she was a dear friend of mine : so I 'm not going to let you throw yourself away upon any one whose life is n't clear and above - board , you may depend upon it ! "
228072	228274	228033	228034	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 'm sure , Miss Browning , you are very much mistaken if you think that any mother could take more care of Molly than I do . I do n't I ca n't think there is any need for any one to interfere to protect her , and I have not an idea why you have been talking in this way , just as if we were all wrong , and you were all right . It hurts my feelings , indeed it does ; for Molly can tell you there is not a thing or a favour that Cynthia has , that she has not . And as for not taking care of her , why , if she were to go up to London to - morrow , I should make a point of going with her to see after her ; and I never did it for Cynthia when she was at school in France ; and her bedroom is furnished just like Cynthia 's , and I let her wear my red shawl whenever she likes she might have it oftener if she would . I ca n't think what you mean , Miss Browning . "
228275	228300	228479	228479	her	147	" I did not mean to offend you , but I meant just to give Molly a hint . She understands what I mean . "
228301	228309	228311	228311	Molly	147	" I 'm sure I do n't , "
228315	228428	228311	228311	Molly	147	" I have n't a notion what you meant , if you were alluding to anything more than you said straight out , that you do not wish me to marry any one who has n't a good character , and that , as you were a friend of mamma 's , you would prevent my marrying a man with a bad character , by every means in your power . I 'm not thinking of marrying ; I do n't want to marry anybody at all ; but if I did , and he were not a good man , I should thank you for coming and warning me of it . "
228429	228452	228454	228455	Miss Browning	159	" I shall not stand on warning you , Molly . I shall forbid the banns in church , if need be , "
228492	228495	228497	228497	Molly	147	" Do ! "
228499	228584	228479	228479	her	147	" Well , well , I wo n't say any more . Perhaps I was mistaken . We wo n't say any more about it . But remember what I have said , Molly ; there 's no harm in that , at any rate . I 'm sorry I hurt your feelings , Mrs. Gibson . As stepmothers go , I think you try and do your duty . Good morning . Good - by to you both , and God bless you . "
228615	228664	228609	228610	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Try and do my duty , indeed ! I should be much obliged to you , Molly , if you would take care not to behave in such a manner as to bring down upon me such impertinence as I have just been receiving from Miss Browning . "
228665	228681	228683	228683	Molly	147	" But I do n't know what made her talk as she did , mamma , "
228685	228872	228609	228610	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 'm sure I do n't know , and I do n't care either . But I know that I never was spoken to as if I was trying to do my duty before , ' trying ' indeed ! everybody always knew that I did it , without talking about it before my face in that rude manner . I 've that deep feeling about duty that I think it ought only to be talked about in church , and in such sacred places as that ; not to have a common caller startling one with it , even though she was an early friend of your mother 's . And as if I did n't look after you quite as much as I look after Cynthia ! Why , it was only yesterday I went up into Cynthia 's room and found her reading a letter that she put away in a hurry as soon as I came in , and I did n't even ask her who it was from , and I 'm sure I should have made you tell me . "
228916	228922	228924	228924	she	189	" What 's the matter ? "
228933	229000	228912	228912	Cynthia	247	" Why , Molly has been doing something which has set that impertinent Miss Browning off into lecturing me on trying to do my duty ! If your poor father had but lived , Cynthia , I should never have been spoken to as I have been . ' A stepmother trying to do her duty , ' indeed ! That was Miss Browning 's expression . "
229035	229052	229027	229027	Molly	147	" Miss Browning seemed to think I was likely to marry some one whose character was objectionable "
229053	229058	229060	229060	Cynthia	247	" You , Molly ? "
229062	229084	229014	229014	She	189	" Yes she once before spoke to me , I suspect she has got some notion about Mr. Preston in her head "
229095	229115	229091	229091	Molly	147	" And she spoke as if mamma did not look enough after me , I think she was rather provoking "
229116	229125	229127	229128	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Not rather , but very very impertinent , "
229141	229151	229153	229153	Cynthia	247	" What could have put it into her head ? "
229166	229172	229182	229182	her	552	" I do n't know , "
229186	229238	229182	229182	her	552	" I 'm sure I do n't always approve of Mr. Preston ; but even if it was him she was thinking about , he 's far more agreeable than she is ; and I had much rather have him coming to call than an old maid like her any day . "
229239	229254	229256	229256	Molly	147	" I do n't know that it was Mr. Preston she was thinking about , "
229258	229289	229256	229256	Molly	147	" It was only a guess . When you were both in London she spoke about him , I thought she had heard something about you and him , Cynthia . "
229335	229450	229329	229329	Cynthia	247	" Well , after all , it is only your fancy that she was alluding to Mr. Preston , so perhaps we had better not say any more about him ; and as for her advice to mamma to look after you better , Miss Molly , I 'll stand bail for your good behaviour ; for both mamma and I know you 're the last person to do any foolish things in that way . And now do n't let us talk any more about it . I was coming to tell you that Hannah Brand 's little boy has been badly burnt , and his sister is downstairs asking for old linen . "
229484	229529	229477	229477	Cynthia	247	" Molly , pray do n't ever allude to anything between me and Mr. Preston , not to mamma , nor to any one . Never do ! I 've a reason for it , do n't say anything more about it , ever . "
229775	229783	229739	229740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Where have you been , child ? "
229784	229790	229739	229740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Who did you see ? "
229791	229798	229739	229740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Who was that letter from ? "
229799	229819	229739	229740	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Why were you so long out when you had only to go to so - and - so ? "
230110	230143	230105	230105	Molly	147	" If it is hard work for me to help always fretting after Roger , and wondering where he is , and how he is , what must it be for her ? "
230155	230158	230160	230160	he	238	" Molly , "
230162	230167	230160	230160	he	238	" where 's Cynthia ? "
230168	230175	230146	230147	Mr. Gibson	238	" Gone out to do some errands "
230176	230272	230160	230160	he	238	" Well , it 's a pity but never mind . Put on your bonnet and cloak as fast as you can . I 've had to borrow old Simpson 's dog - cart , there would have been room both for you and Cynthia ; but as it is , you must walk back alone . I 'll drive you as far on the Barford Road as I can , and then you must jump down . I ca n't take you on to Broadhurst 's , I may be kept there for hours . "
230346	230353	230355	230355	Molly	147	" Oh , this is charming ! "
230370	230380	230382	230383	Mr. Gibson	238	" For youth , but not for crabbed age , "
230385	230401	230382	230383	Mr. Gibson	238	" My bones are getting rheumatic , and would rather go smoothly over macadamized streets . "
230402	230425	230516	230516	she	5207	" That 's treason to this lovely view and this fine pure air , papa . Only I do n't believe you . "
230426	230461	230382	230383	Mr. Gibson	238	" Thank you . As you are so complimentary , I think I shall put you down at the foot of this hill ; we 've passed the second mile - stone from Hollingford . "
230462	230514	230516	230516	she	5207	" Oh , let me just go up to the top ! I know we can see the blue range of the Malverns from it , and Dorrimer Hall among the woods ; the horse will want a minute 's rest , and then I will get down without a word . "
230586	230623	230630	230630	Molly	147	" Now jump down , lassie , and make the best of your way home before it gets dark . You 'll find the cut over Croston Heath shorter than the road we 've come by . "
230976	230987	230958	230958	she	8199	" bound to know Dr. Gibson 's daughter by sight . "
231190	231203	231187	231187	Cynthia	247	" Oh , Molly , Molly , come and judge between us ! "
231287	231333	231275	231275	He	247	" The subject of our conversation does not well admit of a third person 's presence . As Miss Gibson seems to wish for your company now , I must beg you to fix some other time and place where we can finish our discussion . "
231334	231343	231345	231345	Molly	147	" I will go if Cynthia wishes me , "
231347	231373	231275	231275	He	247	" No , no ; stay I want you to stay I want you to hear it all I wish I had told you sooner . "
231374	231416	231275	231275	He	247	" You mean that you regret that she has not been made aware of our engagement that you promised long ago to be my wife . Pray remember that it was you who made me promise secrecy , not I you ! "
231417	231444	231275	231275	He	247	" I do n't believe him , Cynthia . Do n't , do n't cry if you can help it ; I do n't believe him . "
231445	231448	231450	231450	he	5245	" Cynthia , "
231460	231479	231450	231450	he	5245	" pray , pray do not go on so ; you ca n't think how it distresses me ! "
231537	231541	231543	231543	Molly	147	" Go away ! "
231545	231555	231543	231543	Molly	147	" Do n't you see you make her worse ? "
231579	231582	231584	231584	Molly	147	" Go , "
231588	231614	231584	231584	Molly	147	" if it really distresses you to see her cry . Do n't you see , it 's you who are the cause of it ? "
231615	231624	231626	231626	he	5245	" I will go if Cynthia tells me , "
231630	231643	231645	231645	Cynthia	247	" Oh , Molly , I do n't know what to do , "
231690	231707	231709	231709	Molly	147	" Run to that cottage in the trees , and fetch her a cup of water , "
231716	231723	231725	231725	Molly	147	" Why do n't you go ? "
231729	231747	231787	231787	she	5246	" I have not done speaking to her ; you will not leave before I come back ? "
231748	231763	231787	231787	she	5246	" No . Do n't you see she ca n't move in this state ? "
231790	231798	231787	231787	she	5246	" Molly , I do hate him ! "
231799	231842	231787	231787	she	5246	" But what did he mean by saying you were engaged to him ? Do n't cry , dear , but tell me ; if I can help you I will , but I ca n't imagine what it all really is . "
231843	231879	231787	231787	she	5246	" It 's too long a story to tell now , and I 'm not strong enough . Look ! he 's coming back . As soon as I can , let us get home . "
231880	231886	231888	231888	Molly	147	" With all my heart , "
231905	231908	231910	231910	Molly	147	" Now , "
231912	231932	231910	231910	Molly	147	" we had better go home as fast as you can manage it ; it 's getting dark quickly . "
231956	232013	231954	231954	He	247	" I think since Miss Gibson has made herself acquainted with this much , we had better let her know the whole truth that you are engaged to marry me as soon as you are twenty ; otherwise your being here with me , and by appointment too , may appear strange even equivocal to her . "
232014	232040	231934	231934	she	147	" As I know that Cynthia is engaged to another man , you can hardly expect me to believe what you say , Mr. Preston . "
232041	232046	232048	232048	Cynthia	247	" Oh , Molly , "
232060	232077	232048	232048	Cynthia	247	" I am not engaged neither to the person you mean , nor to Mr. Preston . "
232084	232125	232078	232079	Mr. Preston	247	" I think I have some letters that would convince Miss Gibson of the truth of what I have said ; and which will convince Mr. Osborne Hamley , if necessary I conclude it is to him she is alluding . "
232126	232135	232137	232137	Molly	147	" I am quite puzzled by you both , "
232139	232207	232137	232137	Molly	147	" The only thing I do know is , that we ought not to be standing here at this time of evening , and that Cynthia and I shall go home directly . If you want to talk to Miss Kirkpatrick , Mr. Preston , why do n't you come to my father 's house , and ask to see her openly , and like a gentleman ? "
232208	232214	232216	232216	he	5248	" I am perfectly willing , "
232218	232258	232216	232216	he	5248	" I shall only be too glad to explain to Mr. Gibson on what terms I stand in relation to her . If I have not done it sooner , it is because I have yielded to her wishes . "
232259	232322	232323	232323	She	5249	" Pray , pray do n't . Molly you do n't know all you do n't know anything about it ; you mean well and kindly , I know , but you are only making mischief . I am quite well enough to walk , do let us go ; I will tell you all about it when we are at home . "
232348	232393	232394	232394	He	247	" I do not know what you will say at home ; but can you deny that you are my promised wife ? Can you deny that it has only been at your earnest request that I have kept the engagement secret so long ? "
232405	232465	232342	232342	he	247	" Since you will have it out , since I must speak here , I own that what you say is literally true ; that when I was a neglected girl of sixteen , you whom I believed to be a friend , lent me money at my need , and made me give you a promise of marriage . "
232466	232470	232472	232472	he	247	" Made you ! "
232486	232608	232482	232482	Cynthia	247	" ' Made ' is not the right word , I confess . I liked you then you were almost my only friend and , if it had been a question of immediate marriage , I daresay I should never have objected . But I know you better now ; and you have persecuted me so of late , that I tell you once for all as I have told you before , till I am sick of the very words , that nothing shall ever make me marry you . Nothing ! I see there 's no chance of escaping exposure and , I daresay , losing my character , and I know losing all the few friends I have . "
232609	232613	232615	232615	Molly	147	" Never me , "
232630	232635	232637	232638	Mr. Preston	247	" It is hard , "
232640	232673	232637	232638	Mr. Preston	247	" You may believe all the bad things you like about me , Cynthia , but I do n't think you can doubt my real , passionate , disinterested love for you . "
232674	232680	232682	232682	Cynthia	247	" I do doubt it , "
232690	232715	232682	232682	Cynthia	247	" Ah ! when I think of the self - denying affection I have seen I have known affection that thought of others before itself "
232736	232832	232726	232726	She	147	" You do not call it love which has been willing to wait for years to be silent while silence was desired to suffer jealousy and to bear neglect , relying on the solemn promise of a girl of sixteen for solemn say flimsy , when that girl grows older . Cynthia , I have loved you , and I do love you , and I wo n't give you up . If you will but keep your word , and marry me , I 'll swear I 'll make you love me in return . "
232833	232892	232726	232726	She	147	" Oh , I wish I wish I 'd never borrowed that unlucky money , it was the beginning of it all . Oh , Molly , I have saved and scrimped to repay it , and he wo n't take it now ; I thought if I could but repay it , it would set me free . "
232893	232905	232906	232906	he	5251	" You seem to imply you sold yourself for twenty pounds , "
232981	233003	233005	233005	Cynthia	247	" I did not sell myself ; I liked you then . But oh , how I do hate you now ! "
233061	233128	233052	233052	Molly	147	" Molly , if you pity me if you love me do n't say anything more just now . We shall have to look as if nothing had happened when we get home . Come to my room when we go upstairs to bed , and I 'll tell you all . I know you 'll blame me terribly , but I will tell you all . "
234191	234198	234200	234200	Molly	147	" You said I might come , "
234202	234211	234200	234200	Molly	147	" and that you would tell me all . "
234212	234220	234222	234222	Cynthia	247	" You know all , I think , "
234226	234250	234222	234222	Cynthia	247	" Perhaps you do n't know what excuses I have , but at any rate you know what a scrape I am in . "
234251	234260	234262	234262	Molly	147	" I 've been thinking a great deal , "
234268	234279	234262	234262	Molly	147	" And I ca n't help fancying if you told papa "
234291	234294	234296	234296	she	147	" No ! "
234298	234375	234296	234296	she	147	" That I wo n't . Unless I 'm to leave here at once . And you know I have not another place to go to without warning , I mean . I daresay my uncle would take me in ; he 's a relation , and would be bound to stand by me in whatever disgrace I might be ; or perhaps I might get a governess 's situation a pretty governess I should be ! "
234376	234452	234281	234281	she	147	" Pray , please , Cynthia , do n't go off into such wild talking . I do n't believe you 've done so very wrong . You say you have not , and I believe you . That horrid man has managed to get you involved in some way ; but I am sure papa could set it to rights , if you would only make a friend of him , and tell him all "
234453	234458	234460	234460	Cynthia	247	" No , Molly , "
234462	234495	234460	234460	Cynthia	247	" I ca n't , and there 's an end of it . You may if you like , only let me leave the house first ; give me that much time . "
234496	234513	234515	234515	Molly	147	" You know I would never tell anything you wished me not to tell , Cynthia , "
234520	234527	234529	234529	Cynthia	247	" Would you not , darling ? "
234535	234567	234529	234529	Cynthia	247	" Will you promise me that ? quite a sacred promise ? for it would be such a comfort to me to tell you all , now you know so much . "
234568	234585	234587	234587	Molly	147	" Yes ! I 'll promise not to tell . You should not have doubted me , "
234594	234608	234529	234529	Cynthia	247	" Very well . I trust to you . I know I may . "
234609	234624	234626	234626	Molly	147	" But do think of telling papa , and getting him to help you , "
234628	234631	234633	234633	Cynthia	247	" Never , "
234643	234833	234633	234633	Cynthia	247	" Do you think I forget what he said at the time of that wretched Mr. Coxe ; how severe he was , and how long I was in disgrace , if indeed I 'm out of it now ? I am one of those people , as mamma says sometimes I can not live with persons who do n't think well of me . It may be a weakness , or a sin , I 'm sure I do n't know , and I do n't care ; but I really can not be happy in the same house with any one who knows my faults , and thinks that they are greater than my merits . Now you know your father would do that . I have often told you that he and you too , Molly , had a higher standard than I had ever known . Oh , I could n't bear it ; if he were to know he would be so angry with me he would never get over it , and I have so liked him ! I do so like him ! "
234834	234847	234849	234849	Molly	147	" Well , never mind , dear ; he shall not know , "
234858	234871	234852	234852	Cynthia	247	" at least , we 'll say no more about it now . "
234872	234884	234886	234886	Cynthia	247	" And you 'll never say any more never promise me , "
234893	234933	234633	234633	Cynthia	247	" Never till you give me leave . Now do let me see if I can not help you . Lie down on the bed , and I 'll sit by you , and let us talk it over . "
234948	234955	234957	234957	Molly	147	" When did it all begin ? "
234966	235112	235114	235114	she	5292	" Long ago four or five years . I was such a child to be left all to myself . It was the holidays , and mamma was away visiting , and the Donaldsons asked me to go with them to the Worcester Festival . You ca n't fancy how pleasant it all sounded , especially to me . I had been shut up in that great dreary house at Ashcombe , where mamma had her school ; it belonged to Lord Cumnor , and Mr. Preston as his agent had to see it all painted and papered ; but , besides that , he was very intimate with us ; I believe mamma thought no , I 'm not sure about that , and I have enough blame to lay at her door , to prevent my telling you anything that may be only fancy "
235168	235336	235157	235157	Cynthia	247	" Well ! at any rate we were intimate with him , and he came a great deal about the house , and knew as much as any one of mamma 's affairs , and all the ins and outs of her life . I 'm telling you this in order that you may understand how natural it was for me to answer his questions when he came one day and found me , not crying , for you know I 'm not much given to that , in spite of to - day 's exposure of myself ; but fretting and fuming because , though mamma had written word I might go with the Donaldsons , she had never said how I was to get any money for the journey , much less for anything of dress , and I had outgrown all my last year 's frocks , and as for gloves and boots in short , I really had hardly clothes decent enough for church "
235337	235351	235353	235353	Molly	147	" Why did n't you write to her and tell her all this ? "
235368	235527	235157	235157	Cynthia	247	" I wish I had her letter to show you ; you must have seen some of mamma 's letters , though ; do n't you know how she always seems to leave out just the important point of every fact ? In this case she descanted largely on the enjoyment she was having , and the kindness she was receiving , and her wish that I could have been with her , and her gladness that I too was going to have some pleasure ; but the only thing that would have been of real use to me she left out , and that was where she was going to next . She mentioned that she was leaving the house she was stopping at the day after she wrote , and that she should be at home by a certain date ; but I got the letter on a Saturday , and the festival began the next Tuesday "
235528	235532	235534	235534	Molly	147	" Poor Cynthia ! "
235536	235577	235534	235534	Molly	147	" Still , if you had written , your letter might have been forwarded . I do n't mean to be hard , only I do so dislike the thought of your ever having made a friend of that man . "
235578	235581	235583	235583	Cynthia	435	" Ah ! "
235587	235646	235583	235583	Cynthia	435	" How easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly ! I was only a young girl , hardly more than a child , and he was a friend to us then excepting mamma , the only friend I knew ; the Donaldsons were only kind and good - natured acquaintances . "
235647	235652	235654	235654	Molly	147	" I am sorry , "
235658	235680	235654	235654	Molly	147	" I have been so happy with papa . I hardly can understand how different it must have been with you . "
235681	236235	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" Different ! I should think so . The worry about money made me sick of my life . We might not say we were poor , it would have injured the school ; but I would have stinted and starved if mamma and I had got on as happily together as we might have done as you and Mr. Gibson do . It was not the poverty ; it was that she never seemed to care to have me with her . As soon as the holidays came round she was off to some great house or another ; and I daresay I was at a very awkward age to have me lounging about in the drawing - room when callers came . Girls at the age I was then are so terribly keen at scenting out motives , and putting in their disagreeable questions as to the little twistings and twirlings and vanishings of conversation ; they 've no distinct notion of what are the truths and falsehoods of polite life . At any rate , I was very much in mamma 's way , and I felt it . Mr. Preston seemed to feel it too for me ; and I was very grateful to him for kind words and sympathetic looks crumbs of kindness which would have dropped under your table unnoticed . So this day , when he came to see how the workmen were getting on , he found me in the deserted schoolroom , looking at my faded summer bonnet and some old ribbons I had been sponging , and half - worn - out gloves a sort of rag - fair spread out on the deal table . I was in a regular passion with only looking at that shabbiness . He said he was so glad to hear I was going to this festival with the Donaldsons ; old Betty , our servant , had told him the news , I believe . But I was so perplexed about money , and my vanity was so put out about my shabby dress , that I was in a pet , and said I should n't go . He sate down on the table , and little by little he made me tell him all my troubles . I do sometimes think he was very nice in those days . Somehow I never felt as if it was wrong or foolish or anything to accept his offer of money at the time . He had twenty pounds in his pocket , he said , and really did n't know what to do with it , should n't want it for months ; I could repay it , or rather mamma could , when it suited her . She must have known I should want money , and most likely thought I should apply to him . Twenty pounds would n't be too much , I must take it all , and so on . I knew at least I thought I knew that I should never spend twenty pounds ; but I thought I could give him back what I did n't want , and so well , that was the beginning ! It does n't sound so very wrong , does it , Molly ? "
236236	236239	236241	236241	Molly	147	" No , "
236270	236406	236408	236408	Cynthia	247	" Well , what with boots and gloves , and a bonnet and a mantle , and a white muslin gown , which was made for me before I left on Tuesday , and a silk gown that followed to the Donaldsons ' , and my journeys , and all , there was very little left of the twenty pounds , especially when I found I must get a ball - dress in Worcester , for we were all to go to the Ball . Mrs. Donaldson gave me my ticket , but she rather looked grave at my idea of going to the Ball in my white muslin , which I had already worn two evenings at their house . Oh dear ! how pleasant it must be to be rich ! You know , "
236415	236913	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" I ca n't help being aware that I 'm pretty , and that people admire me very much . I found it out first at the Donaldsons ' . I began to think I did look pretty in my fine new clothes , and I saw that other people thought so too . I was certainly the belle of the house , and it was very pleasant to feel my power . The last day or two of that gay week Mr. Preston joined our party . The last time he had seen me was when I was dressed in shabby clothes too small for me , half - crying in my solitude , neglected and penniless . At the Donaldsons ' I was a little queen ; and as I said , fine feathers make fine birds , and all the people were making much of me ; and at that Ball , which was the first night he came , I had more partners than I knew what to do with . I suppose he really did fall in love with me then . I do n't think he had done so before . And then I began to feel how awkward it was to be in his debt . I could n't give myself airs to him as I did to others . Oh ! it was so awkward and uncomfortable ! But I liked him , and felt him as a friend all the time . The last day I was walking in the garden along with the others , and I thought I would tell him how much I had enjoyed myself , and how happy I had been , all thanks to his twenty pounds I was beginning to feel like Cinderella when the clock was striking twelve , and to tell him it should be repaid to him as soon as possible , though I turned sick at the thought of telling mamma , and knew enough of our affairs to understand how very difficult it would be to muster up the money . The end of our talk came very soon ; for , almost to my terror , he began to talk violent love to me , and to beg me to promise to marry him . I was so frightened , that I ran away to the others . But that night I got a letter from him , apologizing for startling me , renewing his offer , his entreaties for a promise of marriage , to be fulfilled at any date I would please to name in fact , a most urgent love - letter , and in it a reference to my unlucky debt , which was to be a debt no longer , only an advance of the money to be hereafter mine if only You can fancy it all , Molly , better than I can remember it to tell it you . "
236914	236921	236923	236923	Molly	147	" And what did you say ? "
236927	237241	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" I did not answer it at all until another letter came , entreating for a reply . By that time mamma had come home , and the old daily pressure and plaint of poverty had come on . Mary Donaldson wrote to me often , singing the praises of Mr. Preston as enthusiastically as if she had been bribed to do it . I had seen him a very popular man in their set , and I liked him well enough , and felt grateful to him . So I wrote and gave him my promise to marry him when I was twenty , but it was to be a secret till then . And I tried to forget I had ever borrowed money of him , but somehow as soon as I felt pledged to him I began to hate him . I could n't endure his eagerness of greeting if ever he found me alone ; and mamma began to suspect , I think . I can not tell you all the ins and outs ; in fact , I did n't understand them at the time , and I do n't remember clearly how it all happened now . But I know that Lady Cuxhaven sent mamma some money to be applied to my education , as she called it ; and mamma seemed very much put out and in very low spirits , and she and I did n't get on at all together . So , of course , I never ventured to name the hateful twenty pounds to her , but went on trying to think that if I was to marry Mr. Preston , it need never be paid very mean and wicked , I daresay ; but oh , Molly , I 've been punished for it , for how I abhor that man . "
237242	237266	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" But why ? When did you begin to dislike him ? You seem to have taken it very passively all this time . "
237267	237480	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" I do n't know . It was growing upon me before I went to that school at Boulogne . He made me feel as if I was in his power ; and by too often reminding me of my engagement to him , he made me critical of his words and ways . There was an insolence in his manner to mamma , too . Ah ! you 're thinking that I 'm not too respectful a daughter and perhaps not ; but I could n't bear his covert sneers at her faults , and I hated his way of showing what he called his ' love ' for me . Then , after I had been a semestre at Mdme . Lefevre 's , a new English girl came a cousin of his , who knew but little of me . Now , Molly , you must forget as soon as I 've told you what I 'm going to say ; and she used to talk so much and perpetually about her cousin Robert he was the great man of the family , evidently and how he was so handsome , and every lady of the land in love with him , a lady of title into the bargain . "
237481	237488	237490	237490	Molly	162	" Lady Harriet ! I daresay , "
237494	237500	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" I do n't know , "
237506	237601	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" I did n't care at the time , and I do n't care now ; for she went on to say there was a very pretty widow too , who made desperate love to him . He had often laughed with them at all her little advances , which she thought he did n't see through . And , oh ! and this was the man I had promised to marry , and gone into debt to , and written love - letters to ! So now you understand it all , Molly . "
237602	237624	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" No , I do n't yet . What did you do on hearing how he had spoken about your mother ? "
237625	237670	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" There was but one thing to do . I wrote and told him I hated him , and would never , never marry him , and would pay him back his money and the interest on it as soon as ever I could . "
237671	237674	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" Well ? "
237675	237795	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" And Mdme . Lefevre brought me back my letter , unopened , I will say ; and told me that she did n't allow letters to gentlemen to be sent by the pupils of her establishment unless she had previously seen their contents . I told her he was a family friend , the agent who managed mamma 's affairs I really could not stick at the truth ; but she would n't let it go ; and I had to see her burn it , and to give her my promise I would n't write again before she would consent not to tell mamma . So I had to calm down and wait till I came home . "
237796	237813	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" But you did n't see him then ; at least , not for some time ? "
237814	237836	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" No , but I could write ; and I began to try and save up my money to pay him . "
237837	237846	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" What did he say to your letter ? "
237847	237885	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" Oh , at first he pretended not to believe I could be in earnest ; he thought it was only pique , or a temporary offence to be apologized for and covered over with passionate protestations . "
237886	237890	236266	236266	Cynthia	247	" And afterwards ? "
237891	237951	237502	237502	Cynthia	247	" He condescended to threats ; and , what is worse , then I turned coward . I could n't bear to have it all known and talked about , and my silly letters shown oh , such letters ! I can not bear to think of them , beginning , ' My dearest Robert , ' to that man "
237952	237969	237971	237971	Molly	162	" But , oh , Cynthia , how could you go and engage yourself to Roger ? "
237973	237977	237979	237979	Cynthia	247	" Why not ? "
237987	238092	237979	237979	Cynthia	247	" I was free I am free ; it seemed a way of assuring myself that I was quite free ; and I did like Roger it was such a comfort to be brought into contact with people who could be relied upon ; and I was not a stock or a stone that I could fail to be touched with his tender , unselfish love , so different to Mr. Preston 's . I know you do n't think me good enough for him ; and , of course , if all this comes out , he wo n't think me good enough either "
238103	238193	237979	237979	Cynthia	247	" and sometimes I think I 'll give him up , and go off to some fresh life amongst strangers ; and once or twice I 've thought I would marry Mr. Preston out of pure revenge , and have him for ever in my power only I think I should have the worst of it ; for he is cruel in his very soul tigerish , with his beautiful striped skin and relentless heart . I have so begged and begged him to let me go without exposure . "
238194	238200	238202	238202	Molly	162	" Never mind the exposure , "
238204	238216	238202	238202	Molly	162	" It will recoil far more on him than harm you . "
238223	238274	238217	238217	Cynthia	247	" But I said things in those letters about mamma . I was quick - eyed enough to all her faults , and hardly understood the force of her temptations ; and he says he will show those letters to your father , unless I consent to acknowledge our engagement . "
238275	238280	238282	238282	Molly	162	" He shall not ! "
238311	238352	238300	238300	she	162	" I am not afraid of him . He dare not insult me , or if he does I do n't care . I will ask him for those letters , and see if he will dare to refuse me . "
238353	238360	238362	238362	Cynthia	247	" You do n't know him , "
238368	238528	238529	238529	She	5294	" He has made many an appointment with me , just as if he would take back the money which has been sealed up ready for him this four months ; or as if he would give me back my letters . Poor , poor Roger ! How little he thinks of all this ! When I want to write words of love to him I pull myself up , for I have written words as affectionate to that other man . And if Mr. Preston ever guessed that Roger and I were engaged , he would manage to be revenged on both him and me , by giving us as much pain as he could with those unlucky letters written when I was not sixteen , Molly , only seven of them ! They are like a mine under my feet , which may blow up any day ; and down will come father and mother and all . "
238541	238548	238550	238550	Molly	162	" How can I get them ? "
238554	238572	238550	238550	Molly	162	" for get them I will . With papa to back me , he dare not refuse . "
238573	238604	238685	238685	she	162	" Ah ! But that 's just the thing . He knows I 'm afraid of your father 's hearing of it all , more than of any one else . "
238605	238614	238550	238550	Molly	162	" And yet he thinks he loves you ! "
238615	238658	238659	238659	Cynthia	247	" It is his way of loving . He says often enough he does n't care what he does so that he gets me to be his wife ; and that after that he is sure he can make me love him . "
238719	238733	238735	238735	Cynthia	247	" Oh , it is such a comfort to have told you all ! "
238742	238767	238738	238738	Molly	162	" I am sure we have right on our side ; and that makes me certain he must and shall give up the letters . "
238768	238774	238776	238776	Cynthia	247	" And take the money ? "
238790	238839	238841	238841	she	162	" He must take the money . Oh , Molly , you can never manage it all without its coming out to your father ! And I would far rather go out to Russia as a governess . I almost think I would rather no , not that , "
238853	238896	238841	238841	she	162	" But he must not know please , Molly , he must not know . I could n't bear it . I do n't know what I might not do . You 'll promise me never to tell him , or mamma ? "
238897	238913	238914	238914	She	162	" I never will . You do not think I would for anything short of saving "
238929	238934	238914	238914	She	162	" But Cynthia broke in ,
238935	238999	238841	238841	she	162	" For nothing . No reason whatever must make you tell your father . If you fail , you fail , and I will love you for ever for trying ; but I shall be no worse off than before . Better , indeed ; for I shall have the comfort of your sympathy . But promise me not to tell Mr. Gibson . "
239000	239006	239008	239008	Molly	162	" I have promised once , "
239010	239063	239008	239008	Molly	162	" but I promise again ; so now do go to bed , and try and rest . You are looking as white as a sheet ; you 'll be ill if you do n't get some rest ; and it 's past two o'clock , and you 're shivering with cold . "
239515	239526	239528	239529	Mr. Gibson	238	" Let her come down here for change of air , "
239531	239578	239528	239529	Mr. Gibson	238	" The country at this time of the year is better than London , except when the place is surrounded by trees . Now our house is well drained , high up , gravel - soil , and I 'll undertake to doctor her for nothing . "
239579	239585	239587	239588	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It would be charming , "
239635	239681	239632	239632	she	189	" Should not you like it , Cynthia ? and Molly too ? You then , dear , would become acquainted with one of the girls , and I have no doubt you would be asked back again , which would be so very nice ! "
239682	239691	239693	239694	Mr. Gibson	238	" And I should n't let her go , "
239709	239713	239716	239717	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Dear Helen ! "
239719	239746	239716	239717	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I should so like to nurse her ! We would make your consulting - room into her own private sitting - room , my dear . "
239774	239845	239765	239769	a person behind the scenes	5307	" For with an invalid so much depends on tranquillity . In the drawing - room , for instance , she might constantly be disturbed by callers ; and the dining - room is so so what shall I call it ? so dinnery , the smell of meals never seems to leave it ; it would have been different if dear papa had allowed me to throw out that window "
239846	239877	239879	239880	Mr. Gibson	238	" Why ca n't she have the dressing - room for her bedroom , and the little room opening out of the drawing - room for her sitting - room ? "
239882	239886	239765	239769	a person behind the scenes	5307	" The library , "
239905	239953	239891	239892	Mrs. Gibson	189	" why , it would hardly hold a sofa , besides the books and the writing - table ; and there are draughts everywhere . No , my dear , we had better not ask her at all , her own home is comfortable at any rate ! "
239954	239959	239961	239962	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well , well ! "
239983	240057	239961	239962	Mr. Gibson	238	" Perhaps you 're right . It 's a case of luxury versus fresh air . Some people suffer more from want of the one than from want of the other . You know I shall be glad to see her if she likes to come , and take us as we are , but I ca n't give up the consulting - room . It 's a necessity ; our daily bread ! "
240058	240071	240073	240074	his wife	995	" I 'll write and tell them how kind Mr. Gibson is , "
240086	240102	240073	240074	his wife	995	" They 'll be just as much obliged to him as if she had come ! "
240182	240185	240187	240187	she	147	" Molly , "
240189	240249	240187	240187	she	147	" will you do it ? Will you do what you said last night ? I 've been thinking of it all day , and sometimes I believe he would give you back the letters if you asked him ; he might fancy at any rate it 's worth trying , if you do n't very much dislike it . "
240344	240401	240338	240338	Cynthia	247	" You shall meet him in the avenue leading from the park lodge up to the Towers . He can come in one way from the Towers , where he has often business he has pass - keys everywhere you can go in as we have often done by the lodge you need not go far . "
240440	240505	240434	240434	Cynthia	247	" Oh ! never mind ! He will only be too glad to come ; you heard him say he wished to discuss the affair more ; it is the first time the appointment has come from my side . If I can but once be free oh , Molly , I will love you , and be grateful to you all my life ! "
240519	240554	240555	240555	She	147	" It must be horrible I think I 'm very brave but I do n't think I could have could have accepted even Roger , with a half - cancelled engagement hanging over me . "
240561	240570	240572	240572	Cynthia	247	" You forget how I detest Mr. Preston ! "
240574	240744	240572	240572	Cynthia	247	" It was that , more than any excess of love for Roger , that made me thankful to be at least as securely pledged to some one else . He did not want to call it an engagement , but I did ; because it gave me the feeling of assurance that I was free from Mr. Preston . And so I am ! all but these letters . Oh ! if you can but make him take back his abominable money , and get me my letters ! Then we would bury it all in oblivion , and he could marry somebody else , and I would marry Roger , and no one would be the wiser . After all , it was only what people call ' youthful folly . ' And you may tell Mr. Preston that as soon as he makes my letters public , shows them to your father or anything , I 'll go away from Hollingford , and never come back . "
241099	241106	241108	241108	he	247	" Is Cynthia unable to come ? "
241116	241129	241131	241131	Molly	147	" I did not know you thought that you should meet her , "
241210	241218	241220	241221	Mr. Preston	247	" She said she should be here , "
241281	241293	241295	241295	Molly	147	" At any rate she sent me here to meet you , "
241297	241311	241295	241295	Molly	147	" She has told me exactly how matters stand between you and her . "
241312	241316	241318	241318	he	247	" Has she ? "
241320	241335	241318	241318	he	247	" She is not always the most open or reliable person in the world ! "
241367	241406	241295	241295	Molly	147	" You should not speak so of the person you profess to wish to have for your wife . But putting all that aside , you have some letters of hers that she wishes to have back again . "
241407	241411	241336	241336	Molly	147	" I daresay . "
241412	241422	241295	241295	Molly	147	" And that you have no right to keep . "
241423	241437	241336	241336	Molly	147	" No legal , or no moral right ? which do you mean ? "
241438	241481	241295	241295	Molly	147	" I do not know ; simply you have no right at all , as a gentleman , to keep a girl 's letters when she asks for them back again , much less to hold them over her as a threat . "
241482	241493	241495	241495	he	5324	" I see you do know all , Miss Gibson , "
241506	241538	241495	241495	he	5324	" At least she has told you her story from her point of view , her side ; now you must hear mine . She promised me as solemnly as ever woman "
241539	241555	241295	241295	Molly	147	" She was not a woman , she was only a girl , barely sixteen . "
241556	241736	241495	241495	he	5324	" Old enough to know what she was doing ; but I 'll call her a girl if you like . She promised me solemnly to be my wife , making the one stipulation of secrecy , and a certain period of waiting ; she wrote me letters repeating this promise , and confidential enough to prove that she considered herself bound to me by such an implied relation . I do n't give in to humbug I do n't set myself up as a saint and in most ways I can look after my own interests pretty keenly ; you know enough of her position as a penniless girl , and at that time , with no influential connections to take the place of wealth , and help me on in the world , it was as sincere and unworldly a passion as ever man felt ; she must say so herself . I might have married two or three girls with plenty of money ; one of them was handsome enough , and not at all reluctant . "
241751	241798	241737	241737	Molly	147	" I beg your pardon , but I do not want to hear accounts of young ladies whom you might have married ; I come here simply on behalf of Cynthia , who does not like you , and who does not wish to marry you . "
241799	241872	241737	241737	Molly	147	" Well , then , I must make her ' like ' me , as you call it . She did ' like ' me once , and made promises which she will find it requires the consent of two people to break . I do n't despair of making her love me as much as ever she did , according to her letters , at least , when we are married . "
241873	241880	241882	241882	Molly	147	" She will never marry you , "
241886	241911	241737	241737	Molly	147	" Then if she ever honours any one else with her preference , he shall be allowed the perusal of her letters to me . "
241998	242015	241993	241994	Mr. Preston	247	" You said the other day that Cynthia was engaged . May I ask whom to ? "
242016	242019	242021	242021	Molly	147	" No , "
242023	242106	242021	242021	Molly	147	" you may not . You heard her say it was not an engagement . It is not exactly ; and if it were a full engagement , do you think , after what you last said , I should tell you to whom ? But you may be sure of this , he would never read a line of your letters . He is too No ! I wo n't speak of him before you . You could never understand him . "
242107	242142	242144	242145	Mr. Preston	247	" It seems to me that this mysterious ' he ' is a very fortunate person to have such a warm defender in Miss Gibson , to whom he is not at all engaged , "
242186	242232	242153	242153	his	247	" No honourable man or woman will read your letters , and if any people do read them , they will be so much ashamed of it that they wo n't dare to speak of them . What use can they be of to you ? "
242233	242243	242245	242245	he	247	" They contain Cynthia 's reiterated promises of marriage , "
242247	242270	242153	242153	his	247	" She says she would rather leave Hollingford for ever , and go out to earn her bread , than marry you . "
242291	242326	242327	242327	he	247	" Does she say that to you in cold blood ? Do you know you are telling me very hard truths , Miss Gibson ? If they are truths , that is to say , "
242335	242372	242327	242327	he	247	" Young ladies are very fond of the words ' hate ' and ' detest . ' I 've known many who have applied them to men whom they were all the time hoping to marry . "
242373	242382	242384	242384	Molly	147	" I can not tell about other people , "
242386	242393	242384	242384	Molly	147	" I only know that Cynthia does "
242418	242432	242414	242414	she	147	" does as nearly hate you as anybody like her ever does hate . "
242433	242437	242439	242439	he	247	" Like her ? "
242457	242466	242468	242468	Molly	147	" I mean , I should hate worse , "
242504	242531	242484	242484	He	247	" So now would you mind sending her back the letters by me ? I do assure you that you can not make her marry you . "
242532	242541	242543	242543	he	247	" You are very simple , Miss Gibson , "
242551	242641	242543	242543	he	247	" I suppose you do n't know that there is any other feeling that can be gratified , except love . Have you never heard of revenge ? Cynthia has cajoled me with promises , and little as you or she may believe me well , it 's no use speaking of that . I do n't mean to let her go unpunished . You may tell her that . I shall keep the letters , and make use of them as I see fit when the occasion arises . "
242709	242768	242687	242689	the two girls	3051	" Mr. Osborne Hamley may hear of their contents , though he may be too honourable to read them . Nay , even your father may hear whispers ; and if I remember them rightly , Miss Cynthia Kirkpatrick does not always speak in the most respectful terms of the lady who is now Mrs. Gibson . There are "
242769	242772	242774	242774	Molly	147	" Stop , "
242776	242895	242774	242774	Molly	147	" I wo n't hear anything out of these letters , written , when she was almost without friends , to you , whom she looked upon as a friend ! But I have thought of what I will do next . I give you fair warning . If I had not been foolish , I should have told my father , but Cynthia made me promise that I would not . So I will tell it all , from beginning to end , to Lady Harriet , and ask her to speak to her father . I feel sure that she will do it ; and I do n't think you will dare to refuse Lord Cumnor . "
243226	243249	243219	243219	his	247	" Keep quiet . You must be seen . You , at any rate , have done nothing to be ashamed of . "
243319	243355	243357	243357	his	247	" Miss Gibson ! your servant . Rather a blustering day for a young lady to be out , and cold , I should say , for standing still too long ; eh , Preston ? "
243367	243370	243372	243373	Mr. Preston	247	" Yes , "
243375	243389	243372	243373	Mr. Preston	247	" and I 'm afraid I have kept Miss Gibson too long standing . "
243468	243482	243464	243465	Mr. Sheepshanks	153	" Sorry to have disturbed your tete - a - tete , Preston , "
243543	243566	243567	243567	She	147	" Well , Molly ? Oh ! I see you have n't got them . After all , I never expected it . "
243594	243616	243521	243521	Cynthia	247	" I am so sorry ; I did all I could ; we were interrupted at last Mr. Sheepshanks rode up . "
243617	243642	243567	243567	She	147	" Provoking old man ! Do you think you should have persuaded him to give up the letters if you had had more time ? "
243643	243673	243521	243521	Cynthia	247	" I do n't know . I wish Mr. Sheepshanks had n't come up just then . I did n't like his finding me standing talking to Mr. Preston . "
243674	243694	243567	243567	She	147	" Oh ! I daresay he 'd never think anything about it . What did he Mr. Preston say ? "
243695	243727	243521	243521	Cynthia	247	" He seemed to think you were fully engaged to him , and that these letters were the only proof he had . I think he loves you in his way . "
243728	243734	243736	243736	Cynthia	247	" His way , indeed ! "
243740	243794	243521	243521	Cynthia	247	" The more I think of it , the more I see it would be better for papa to speak to him . I did say I would tell it all to Lady Harriet , and get Lord Cumnor to make him give up the letters . But it would be very awkward . "
243795	243798	243800	243800	Cynthia	247	" Very ! "
243804	243815	243800	243800	Cynthia	247	" But he would see it was only a threat . "
243816	243852	243521	243521	Cynthia	247	" But I will do it in a moment , if you like . I meant what I said ; only I feel that papa would manage it best of all , and more privately . "
243853	243909	243910	243910	Cynthia	247	" I 'll tell you what , Molly you 're bound by a promise , you know , and can not tell Mr. Gibson without breaking your solemn word but it 's just this : I 'll leave Hollingford and never come back again , if ever your father hears of this affair ; there ! "
243929	243935	243939	243939	Molly	147	" Oh , Cynthia Roger ! "
243942	244118	243939	243939	Molly	147	" Yes , I know ! you need not remind me of him . But I 'm not going to live in the house with any one who may be always casting up in his mind the things he had heard against me things faults , perhaps which sound so much worse than they really are . I was so happy when I first came here ; you all liked me , and admired me , and thought well of me , and now Why , Molly , I can see the difference in you already . You carry your thoughts in your face I have read them there these two days you 've been thinking , ' How Cynthia must have deceived me ; keeping up a correspondence all this time having half - engagements to two men ! ' You 've been more full of that than of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for herself , without any friend to help her and protect her . "
244235	244244	244246	244246	Cynthia	247	" Oh ! what a brute I am ! "
244252	244273	244246	244246	Cynthia	247	" I see I know it is the truth , and I deserve it but I need not reproach you . "
244274	244281	244283	244283	Molly	147	" You did not reproach me ! "
244289	244318	244283	244283	Molly	147	" I have thought something of what you said but I do love you dearly dearly , Cynthia I should have done just the same as you did . "
244319	244333	244246	244246	Cynthia	247	" No , you would not . Your grain is different , somehow . "
244528	244538	244514	244514	she	189	" There ! I must say I expected that ! "
244547	244688	244545	244545	she	189	" It is a letter from uncle Kirkpatrick , love . So kind , wishing you to go and stay with them , and help them to cheer up Helen ; poor Helen ! I am afraid she is very far from well . But we could not have had her here , without disturbing dear papa in his consulting - room ; and , though I could have relinquished my dressing - room he well ! so I said in my letter how you were grieved you above all of us , because you are such a friend of Helen 's , you know and how you longed to be of use , as I am sure you do and so now they want you to go up directly , for Helen has quite set her heart upon it . "
244694	244700	244702	244702	she	252	" I shall like going , "
244703	244711	244712	244712	she	252	" all but leaving you , Molly , "
244728	244746	244748	244749	Mr. Gibson	238	" Can you be ready to go by the ' Bang - up ' to - night ? "
244751	244799	244748	244749	Mr. Gibson	238	" for , curiously enough , after more than twenty years of quiet practice at Hollingford , I am summoned up to - day for the first time to a consultation in London to - morrow . I 'm afraid Lady Cumnor is worse , my dear . "
244800	244836	244712	244712	she	252	" You do n't say so ? Poor dear lady ! What a shock it is to me ! I 'm so glad I 've had some breakfast . I could not have eaten anything . "
244837	244874	244748	244749	Mr. Gibson	238	" Nay , I only say she is worse . With her complaint , being worse may be only a preliminary to being better . Do n't take my words for more than their literal meaning . "
244875	244894	244712	244712	she	252	" Thank you . How kind and reassuring dear papa always is ! About your gowns , Cynthia ? "
244895	244939	244941	244941	she	5352	" Oh , they 're all right , mamma , thank you . I shall be quite ready by four o'clock . Molly , will you come with me and help me to pack ? I wanted to speak to you , dear , "
244951	244987	244941	244941	she	5352	" It is such a relief to get away from a place haunted by that man ; but I 'm afraid you thought I was glad to leave you ; and indeed I am not . "
244994	244998	244712	244712	she	252	" protesting too much "
245013	245099	245009	245009	She	147	" Indeed I did not . I know from my own feelings how you must dislike meeting a man in public in a different manner from what you have done in private . I shall try not to see Mr. Preston again for a long , long time , I 'm sure . But , Cynthia , you have n't told me one word out of Roger 's letter . Please , how is he ? Has he quite got over his attack of fever ? "
245100	245138	245009	245009	She	147	" Yes , quite . He writes in very good spirits . A great deal about birds and beasts , as usual , habits of natives , and things of that kind . You may read from there "
245145	245231	245009	245009	She	147	" to there , if you can . And I 'll tell you what , I 'll trust you with it , Molly , while I pack ; and that shows my sense of your honour not but what you might read it all , only you 'd find the love - making dull ; but make a little account of where he is , and what he is doing , date , and that sort of thing , and send it to his father . "
245332	245358	245377	245377	she	147	" No one here ? What a blessing ! Ah , Miss Molly , you are more eloquent than you believe yourself . Look here ! "
245384	245393	245377	245377	she	147	" What 's the matter , sweet one ? "
245400	245475	245377	245377	she	147	" Is it worrying itself over that letter ? Why , do n't you see these are my very own horrible letters , that I am going to burn directly , that Mr. Preston has had the grace to send me , thanks to you , little Molly cuishla ma chree , pulse of my heart , the letters that have been hanging over my head like somebody 's sword for these two years ? "
245476	245484	245486	245486	Molly	147	" Oh , I am so glad ! "
245493	245544	245486	245486	Molly	147	" I never thought he would have sent them . He is better than I believed him . And now it is all over . I am so glad ! You quite think he means to give up all claim over you by this , do n't you , Cynthia ? "
245545	245604	245609	245609	she	5357	" He may claim , but I wo n't be claimed ; and he has no proofs now . It is the most charming relief ; and I owe it all to you , you precious little lady ! Now there 's only one thing more to be done ; and if you would but do it for me "
245614	245651	245377	245377	she	147	" Oh , Cynthia , do n't ask me ; I can not do any more . You do n't know how sick I go when I think of yesterday , and Mr. Sheepshanks ' look . "
245652	245803	245377	245377	she	147	" It is only a very little thing . I wo n't burden your conscience with telling you how I got my letters , but it is not through a person I can trust with money ; and I must force him to take back his twenty - three pounds odd shillings . I have put it together at the rate of five per cent . , and it 's sealed up . Oh , Molly , I should go off with such a light heart if you would only try to get it safely to him . It 's the last thing ; there would be no immediate hurry , you know . You might meet him by chance in a shop , in the street , even at a party and if you only had it with you in your pocket , there would be nothing so easy . "
245808	245839	245804	245804	Molly	147	" Papa would give it to him . There would be no harm in that . I would tell him he must ask no questions as to what it was . "
245840	245844	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" Very well , "
245848	245896	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" have it your own way . I think my way is the best : for if any of this affair comes out But you 've done a great deal for me already , and I wo n't blame you now for declining to do any more ! "
245897	245909	245911	245911	Molly	147	" I do so dislike having these underhand dealings with him , "
245913	245942	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" Underhand ! just simply giving him a letter from me ! If I left a note for Miss Browning , should you dislike giving it to her ? "
245943	245957	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" You know that 's very different . I could do it openly . "
245958	246010	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" And yet there might be writing in that ; and there would n't be a line with the money . It would only be the winding - up the honourable , honest winding - up of an affair which has worried me for years . But do as you like ! "
246011	246016	246018	246018	Molly	147	" Give it me ! "
246020	246025	246018	246018	Molly	147	" I will try . "
246026	246078	245846	245846	Cynthia	247	" There 's a darling ! You can but try ; and if you ca n't give it to him in private , without getting yourself into a scrape , why , keep it till I come back again . He shall have it then , whether he will or no ! "
246342	246359	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You and I must go on the next journey , I think , my dear , "
246391	246492	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" We have been stay - at - homes for a long time , and variety of scene is so desirable for the young ! But I think the travellers will be wishing themselves at home by this nice bright fireside . ' There 's no place like home , ' as the poet says . ' Mid pleasures and palaces although I may roam , ' it begins , and it 's both very pretty and very true . It 's a great blessing to have such a dear little home as this , is not it , Molly ? "
246493	246496	246498	246498	Molly	147	" Yes , "
246507	246510	246498	246498	Molly	147	" toujours perdrix "
246539	246651	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" To be sure , love , it would be very nice for you and me to go a little journey all by ourselves . You and I. No one else . If it were not such miserable weather we would have gone off on a little impromptu tour . I 've been longing for something of the kind for some weeks ; but we live such a restricted kind of life here ! I declare sometimes I get quite sick of the very sight of the chairs and tables that I know so well . And one misses the others too ! It seems so flat and deserted without them ! "
246652	246674	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ! We are very forlorn to - night ; but I think it 's partly owing to the weather ! "
246675	246788	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Nonsense , dear . I ca n't have you giving in to the silly fancy of being affected by weather . Poor dear Mr. Kirkpatrick used to say , ' a cheerful heart makes its own sunshine . ' He would say it to me , in his pretty way , whenever I was a little low for I am a complete barometer you may really judge of the state of the weather by my spirits , I have always been such a sensitive creature ! It is well for Cynthia that she does not inherit it ; I do n't think her easily affected in any way , do you ? "
246800	246817	246789	246789	Molly	147	" No , she certainly is not easily affected not deeply affected perhaps I should say . "
246818	246851	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Many girls , for instance , would have been touched by the admiration she excited I may say the attentions she received when she was at her uncle 's last summer . "
246852	246858	246789	246789	Molly	147	" At Mr. Kirkpatrick 's ? "
246859	247030	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes . There was Mr. Henderson , that young lawyer ; that 's to say , he is studying law , but he has a good private fortune and is likely to have more , so he can only be what I call playing at law . Mr. Henderson was over head and ears in love with her . It is not my fancy , although I grant mothers are partial : both Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick noticed it ; and in one of Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's letters , she said that poor Mr. Henderson was going into Switzerland for the long vacation , doubtless to try and forget Cynthia ; but she really believed he would find it only ' dragging at each remove a lengthening chain . ' I thought it such a refined quotation , and altogether worded so prettily . You must know aunt Kirkpatrick some day , Molly , my love ; she is what I call a woman of a truly elegant mind . "
247031	247051	246789	246789	Molly	147	" I ca n't help thinking it was a pity that Cynthia did not tell them of her engagement . "
247052	247070	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It is not an engagement , my dear ! How often must I tell you that ? "
247071	247080	246789	246789	Molly	147	" But what am I to call it ? "
247081	247157	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't see why you need to call it anything . Indeed , I do n't understand what you mean by ' it . ' You should always try to express yourself intelligibly . It really is one of the first principles of the English language . In fact , philosophers might ask what is language given us for at all , if it is not that we may make our meaning understood ? "
247158	247190	246789	246789	Molly	147	" But there is something between Cynthia and Roger ; they are more to each other than I am to Osborne , for instance . What am I to call it ? "
247191	247403	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You should not couple your name with that of any unmarried young man ; it is so difficult to teach you delicacy , child . Perhaps one may say there is a peculiar relation between dear Cynthia and Roger , but it is very difficult to characterize it ; I have no doubt that is the reason she shrinks from speaking about it . For , between ourselves , Molly , I really sometimes think it will come to nothing . He is so long away , and , privately speaking , Cynthia is not very , very constant . I once knew her very much taken before that little affair is quite gone by ; and she was very civil to Mr. Henderson , in her way ; I fancy she inherits it , for when I was a girl I was beset by lovers , and could never find in my heart to shake them off . You have not heard dear papa say anything of the old Squire , or dear Osborne , have you ? It seems so long since we have heard or seen anything of Osborne . But he must be quite well , I think , or we should have heard of it . "
247404	247445	246789	246789	Molly	147	" I believe he is quite well . Some one said the other day that they had met him riding it was Mrs. Goodenough , now I remember and that he was looking stronger than he had done for years . "
247446	247513	246361	246362	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Indeed ! I am truly glad to hear it . I always was fond of Osborne ; and , do you know , I never really took to Roger ? I respected him and all that , of course ; but to compare him with Mr. Henderson ! Mr. Henderson is so handsome and well - bred , and gets all his gloves from Houbigant ! "
247776	247834	247741	247741	she	189	" I shall not be at home until the afternoon , my dear ! But I hope you will not find it dull . I do n't think you will , for you are something like me , my love never less alone than when alone , as one of the great authors has justly expressed it . "
247916	247926	247928	247928	he	230	" This call is not on you , Molly , "
247937	247961	247928	247928	he	230	" I was in hopes I might have found your father at home ; I thought lunch - time was the best hour . "
248007	248019	248021	248021	Molly	147	" I hope you did not want to see him professionally ? "
248043	248104	248025	248025	she	147	" Yes , I did . I suppose I may help myself to a biscuit and a glass of wine ? No , do n't ring for more . I could not eat it if it was here . But I just want a mouthful ; this is quite enough , thank you . When will your father be back ? "
248105	248142	248025	248025	she	147	" He was summoned up to London . Lady Cumnor is worse . I fancy there is some operation going on ; but I do n't know . He will be back to - morrow night . "
248143	248212	248025	248025	she	147	" Very well . Then I must wait . Perhaps I shall be better by that time . I think it 's half fancy ; but I should like your father to tell me so . He will laugh at me , I daresay ; but I do n't think I shall mind that . He always is severe on fanciful patients , is n't he , Molly ? "
248243	248265	248239	248239	she	147	" Papa enjoys a joke at everything , you know . It is a relief after all the sorrow he sees . "
248266	248301	248302	248302	he	5385	" Very true . There is a great deal of sorrow in the world . I do n't think it 's a very happy place after all . So Cynthia is gone to London ? "
248309	248333	248334	248334	he	5385	" I think I should like to have seen her again . Poor old Roger ! He loves her very dearly , Molly , "
248361	248369	248370	248370	she	147	" Mamma has gone to the Towers , "
248376	248417	248370	248370	she	147	" Lady Cumnor wanted several things that mamma only can find . She will be sorry to miss you . We were speaking of you only yesterday , and she said how long it was since we had seen you . "
248418	248451	248343	248343	him	5385	" I think I 've grown careless ; I 've often felt so weary and ill that it was all I could do to keep up a brave face before my father . "
248452	248462	248464	248464	Molly	147	" Why did you not come and see papa ? "
248466	248472	248464	248464	Molly	147	" or write to him ? "
248473	248520	248343	248343	him	5385	" I can not tell . I drifted on , sometimes better , and sometimes worse , till to - day I mustered up pluck , and came to hear what your father has got to tell me : and all for no use it seems . "
248521	248548	248464	248464	Molly	147	" I am very sorry . But it is only for two days . He shall go and see you as soon as ever he returns . "
248549	248561	248563	248563	Osborne	230	" He must not alarm my father , remember , Molly , "
248584	248594	248596	248596	he	230	" I wish to God Roger was at home ! "
248605	248613	248615	248615	Molly	147	" I ca n't help understanding you , "
248617	248635	248615	248615	Molly	147	" You think yourself very ill ; but is n't it that you are tired just now ? "
248667	248698	248699	248699	He	230	" Well , sometimes I do think I 'm very ill ; and then , again , I think it 's only the moping life sets me fancying and exaggerating . "
248721	248787	248717	248717	he	230	" You see , there are others depending upon me upon my health . You have n't forgotten what you heard that day in the library at home ? No , I know you have n't . I have seen the thought of it in your eyes often since then . I did n't know you at that time . I think I do now . "
248788	248797	248799	248799	Molly	147	" Do n't go on talking so fast , "
248801	248830	248799	248799	Molly	147	" Rest . No one will interrupt us ; I will go on with my sewing ; when you want to say anything more I shall be listening . "
248846	248850	248854	248854	he	5386	" Thank you . "
248874	249044	248854	248854	he	5386	" The name of my wife is Aimťe . Aimťe Hamley , of course . She lives at Bishopsfield , a village near Winchester . Write it down , but keep it to yourself . She is a Frenchwoman , a Roman Catholic , and was a servant . She is a thoroughly good woman . I must not say how dear she is to me . I dare not . I meant once to have told Cynthia , but she did n't seem quite to consider me as a brother . Perhaps she was shy of a new relation ; but you 'll give my love to her , all the same . It is a relief to think that some one else has my secret ; and you are like one of us , Molly . I can trust you almost as I can trust Roger . I feel better already , now I feel that some one else knows the whereabouts of my wife and child . "
249045	249048	249050	249050	Molly	147	" Child ! "
249064	249069	249060	249060	Maria	147	" Miss Phobe Browning . "
249070	249076	249078	249078	he	5387	" Fold up that paper , "
249088	249095	249078	249078	he	5387	" It is only for yourself . "
249138	249177	249136	249136	you	147	" and a look of mistaken intelligence at the tete - a - tete she had disturbed came so perceptibly over Miss Phobe 's face that Molly caught Osborne 's sympathetic eye , and both smiled at the notion .
249178	249195	249197	249197	she	147	" I 'm sure I well ! one must sometimes I see our dinner would have been "
249205	249360	249197	249197	she	147	" We only just heard of Mrs. Gibson 's having a fly from the ' George , ' because sister sent our Nancy to pay for a couple of rabbits Tom Ostler had snared , I hope we sha n't be taken up for poachers , Mr. Osborne snaring does n't require a licence , I believe ? and she heard he was gone off with the fly to the Towers with your dear mamma ; for Coxe who drives the fly in general has sprained his ankle . We had just finished dinner , but when Nancy said Tom Ostler would not be back till night , I said , ' Why , there 's that poor dear girl left all alone by herself , and her mother such a friend of ours , ' when she was alive , I mean . But I 'm sure I 'm glad I 'm mistaken . "
249364	249397	249361	249361	Osborne	230	" I came to speak to Mr. Gibson , not knowing he had gone to London , and Miss Gibson kindly gave me some of her lunch . I must go now . "
249398	249407	249410	249411	Miss Phobe	159	" Oh dear ! I am so sorry , "
249413	249436	249410	249411	Miss Phobe	159	" I disturbed you ; but it was with the best intentions . I always was mal - apropos from a child . "
249478	249509	249452	249452	his	230	" Such a nice suitable thing , and I came in the midst , and spoilt it all . I am sure you 're very kind , my dear , considering "
249510	249556	249449	249449	he	230	" Considering what , my dear Miss Phobe ? If you are conjecturing a love affair between Mr. Osborne Hamley and me , you never were more mistaken in your life . I think I told you so once before . Please do believe me . "
249557	249581	249452	249452	his	230	" Oh , yes ! I remember . And somehow sister got it into her head it was Mr. Preston . I recollect . "
249582	249593	249595	249595	Molly	147	" One guess is just as wrong as the other , "
250490	250512	250479	250480	Mr. Preston	247	" I think we 'll go to Johnson 's now , and come back for the books in a little while . "
250551	250558	250560	250560	she	147	" I 'll be back directly , "
250887	250905	250909	250909	herself	189	" persons in their station of life having a formal dessert set out before them every day . "
250934	250972	250926	250926	she	189	" It 's no extravagance , for we need not eat it I never do . But it looks well , and makes Maria understand what is required in the daily life of every family of position . "
251204	251218	251219	251219	Scandal	447	" as she called it , in her girlish phraseology was not all over .
251341	251346	251382	251382	Martindale	448	" the odd trick , "
251365	251381	251382	251382	Martindale	448	" small crumbs and scraps of daily news came up to the surface , such as "
251397	251400	251382	251382	Martindale	448	" or , "
251438	251441	251442	251442	I	0	" or , "
251505	251505	251489	251489	I	0	"
251551	251565	251567	251568	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Matrimony 's not so bad as you think for , Miss Browning , "
251583	251628	251567	251568	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" If I 'd ha ' seen Nancy , I should ha ' given her my mind very different . It 's a great thing to be able to settle what you 'll have for dinner , without never a one interfering with you . "
251629	251635	251637	251638	Miss Browning	159	" If that 's all ! "
251644	251665	251637	251638	Miss Browning	159	" I can do that ; and , perhaps , better than a woman who has a husband to please . "
251666	251842	251567	251568	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" No one can say as I did n't please my husbands both on 'em , though Jeremy was tickler in his tastes than poor Harry Beaver . But as I used to say to 'em , ' Leave the victual to me ; it 's better for you than knowing what 's to come beforehand . The stomach likes to be taken by surprise . ' And neither of 'em ever repented 'em of their confidence . You may take my word for it , beans and bacon will taste better and Mr. Ashton 's Nancy in her own house than all the sweetbreads and spring chickens she 's been a - doing for him this seventeen years . But if I chose , I could tell you of something as would interest you all a deal more than old Nancy 's marriage to a widower with nine children only as the young folks themselves is meeting in private , clandestine - like , it 's perhaps not for me to tell their secrets . "
251843	251863	251865	251866	Miss Browning	159	" I 'm sure I do n't want to hear of clandestine meetings between young men and young women , "
251873	252199	251870	251870	her	159	" It 's disgrace enough to the people themselves , I consider , if they enter on a love affair without the proper sanction of parents . I know public opinion has changed on the subject ; but when poor Gratia was married to Mr. Byerley , he wrote to my father without ever having so much as paid her a compliment , or said more than the most trivial and commonplace things to her ; and my father and mother sent for her into my father 's study , and she said she was never so much frightened in her life , and they said it was a very good offer , and Mr. Byerley was a very worthy man , and they hoped she would behave properly to him when he came to supper that night . And after that he was allowed to come twice a week till they were married . My mother and I sate at our work in the bow - window of the Rectory drawing - room , and Gratia and Mr. Byerley at the other end ; and my mother always called my attention to some flower or plant in the garden when it struck nine , for that was his time for going . Without offence to the present company , I am rather inclined to look upon matrimony as a weakness to which some very worthy people are prone ; but if they must be married , let them make the best of it , and go through the affair with dignity and propriety : or if there are misdoings and clandestine meetings , and such things , at any rate , never let me hear about them ! I think it 's you to play , Mrs. Dawes . You 'll excuse my frankness on the subject of matrimony ! Mrs. Goodenough there can tell you I 'm a very out - spoken person . "
252200	252222	252224	252225	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" It 's not the out - speaking , it 's what you say that goes against me , Miss Browning , "
252355	252373	252349	252349	She	450	" I do n't know what I have done that any man should make me his slave . "
252447	252527	252442	252443	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Well ! now I may speak out my mind , and say as how if there was a slave between us two , when Goodenough was alive , it was n't me ; and I do n't think as it was pretty in Miss Browning to give herself such airs on her virginity when there was four widows in the room , who 've had six honest men among 'em for husbands . No offence , Miss Airy ! "
252549	252671	252544	252545	Miss Browning	159	" I could tell her of a girl as she 's very fond on , who 's on the high road to matrimony ; and in as cunning a way as ever I heerd on ; going out at dusk to meet her sweetheart , just as if she was my Sally , or your Jenny . And her name is Molly too , which , as I have often thought , shows a low taste in them as first called her so ; she might as well be a scullery - maid at oncest . Not that she 's picked up anybody common ; she 's looked about her for a handsome fellow , and a smart young man enough ! "
252720	252731	252716	252716	she	165	" I suppose you mean Mr. Preston and Miss Gibson ? "
252732	252739	252741	252742	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Why , who told you ? "
252751	252793	252741	252742	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" You ca n't say as I did . There 's many a Molly in Hollingford , besides her , though none , perhaps , in such a genteel station in life . I never named her , I 'm sure . "
252794	252808	252810	252811	Mrs. Dawes	450	" No . But I know . I could tell my tale too , "
252813	252821	252823	252824	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" No ! could you , really ? "
252833	252875	252741	252742	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Yes . My uncle Sheepshanks came upon them in the Park Avenue , he startled 'em a good deal , he said ; and when he taxed Mr. Preston with being with his sweetheart , he did n't deny it . "
252876	252924	252927	252927	they	5456	" Well ! Now so much has come out , I 'll tell you what I know . Only , ladies , I would n't wish to do the girl an unkind turn , so you must keep what I 've got to tell you a secret . "
252934	253021	252741	252742	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" My Hannah , as married Tom Oakes , and lives in Pearson 's Lane , was a - gathering of damsons only a week ago , and Molly Gibson was a - walking fast down the lane , quite in a hurry like to meet some one , and Hannah 's little Anna - Maria fell down , and Molly who 's a kind - hearted lass enough picked her up ; so if Hannah had had her doubts before , she had none then . "
253022	253034	253036	253039	one of the ladies	5457	" But there was no one with her , was there ? "
253059	253215	252741	252742	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" No : I said she looked as if she was going to meet some one , and by - and - by comes Mr. Preston running out of the wood just beyond Hannah 's , and says he , ' A cup of water , please , good woman , for a lady has fainted , or is ' sterical or something . ' Now though he did n't know Hannah , Hannah knew him . ' More folks know Tom Fool , than Tom Fool knows , ' asking Mr. Preston 's pardon ; for he 's no fool whatever he be . And I could tell you more , and what I 've seed with my own eyes . I seed her give him a letter in Grinstead 's shop , only yesterday , and he looked as black as thunder at her , for he seed me if she did n't . "
253216	253226	253228	253229	Miss Airy	455	" It 's a very suitable kind of thing , "
253231	253242	253228	253229	Miss Airy	455	" why do they make such a mystery of it ? "
253243	253249	253251	253252	Mrs. Dawes	450	" Some folks like it , "
253254	253268	253251	253252	Mrs. Dawes	450	" it adds zest to it all , to do their courting underhand . "
253269	253280	253283	253284	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Ay , it 's like salt to their victual , "
253286	253304	253283	253284	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" But I did n't think Molly Gibson was one of that sort , I did n't . "
253305	253313	253315	253316	Mrs. Dawes	450	" The Gibsons hold themselves very high ? "
253326	253334	253315	253316	Mrs. Dawes	450	" Mrs. Gibson has called upon me . "
253335	253350	253353	253354	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Ay , you 're like to be a patient of the doctor 's , "
253356	253398	253251	253252	Mrs. Dawes	450	" She seemed to me very affable , though she is so intimate with the Countess and the family at the Towers ; and is quite the lady herself ; dines late , I 've heard , and everything in style . "
253399	253470	253315	253316	Mrs. Dawes	450	" Style ! very different style to what Bob Gibson , her husband , was used to when first he came here , glad of a mutton - chop in his surgery , for I doubt if he 'd a fire anywhere else ; we called him Bob Gibson then , but none on us dare Bob him now ; I 'd as soon think o ' calling him sweep ! "
253471	253482	253484	253485	one lady	5459	" I think it looks very bad for Miss Gibson ! "
253525	253746	253518	253518	she	165	" Not at all bad , and I 'll trouble you not to use such a word as that about Molly Gibson , as I 've known all her life . It 's odd if you will . I was odd myself as a girl ; I never could abide a plate of gathered gooseberries , but I must needs go and skulk behind a bush and gather 'em for myself . It 's some folk 's taste , though it may n't be Miss Browning 's , who 'd have all the courting done under the nose of the family . All as ever I said was that I was surprised at it in Molly Gibson ; and that I 'd ha ' thought it was liker that pretty piece of a Cynthia as they call her ; indeed , at one time I was ready to swear as it was her Mr. Preston was after . And now , ladies , I 'll wish you a very good night . I can not abide waste ; and I 'll venture for it Sally 's letting the candle in the lantern run all to grease , instead of putting it out , as I 've told her to do , if ever she 's got to wait for me . "
253894	253920	253891	253891	she	147	" Papa ! Mr. Osborne Hamley was here to see you yesterday . He looks very ill , and he 's evidently frightened about himself . "
253939	253968	253936	253936	he	238	" I 'll go and see him ; do n't tell your mother where I 'm gone : you 've not mentioned this to her , I hope ? "
253969	253972	253974	253974	Molly	147	" No , "
253995	254028	253977	253977	she	147	" Do n't say anything about it ; there 's no need . Now I think of it , I ca n't possibly go to - day , but I will go . "
254049	254052	254055	254055	she	147	" nervous , "
254230	254233	254239	254239	she	147	" ungrateful ; "
254435	254444	254446	254446	Molly	147	" Helen can not be so very ill , "
254450	254463	254446	254446	Molly	147	" or Cynthia would not want her pink muslin and daisy wreath . "
254464	254477	254479	254480	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't see that that follows , I 'm sure , "
254484	254651	254479	254480	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Helen would never be so selfish as to tie Cynthia to her side , however ill she was . Indeed , I should not have felt that it was my duty to let Cynthia go to London at all , if I had thought she was to be perpetually exposed to the depressing atmosphere of a sick - room . Besides , it must be so good for Helen to have Cynthia coming in with bright pleasant accounts of the parties she has been to even if Cynthia disliked gaiety I should desire her to sacrifice herself and go out as much as she could , for Helen 's sake . My idea of nursing is that one should not be always thinking of one 's own feelings and wishes , but doing those things which will most serve to beguile the weary hours of an invalid . But then so few people have had to consider the subject so deeply as I have done ! "
254757	254763	254765	254765	herself	189	" um - um - um "
254791	254834	254784	254784	Cynthia	247	" Mr. Henderson 's mother has advised my aunt to consult a certain Dr. Donaldson , who is said to be very clever in such cases as Helen 's , but my uncle is not sufficiently sure of the professional etiquette , c. "
255086	255090	255061	255061	Osborne	230	" more convenient season "
255249	255255	255257	255257	he	247	" It serves her right , "
255261	255270	255257	255257	he	247	" for meddling with other folk 's business , "
255682	255844	255667	255668	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" You see , I do n't think the worse of a girl for meeting her sweetheart here and there and everywhere , till she gets talked about ; but then when she does and Molly Gibson 's name is in everybody 's mouth I think it 's only fair to Bessy , who has trusted me with Annabella not to let her daughter be seen with a lass who has managed her matters so badly as to set folk talking about her . My maxim is this , and it 's a very good working one , you may depend on't women should mind what they 're about , and never be talked of ; and if a woman 's talked of , the less her friends have to do with her till the talk has died away , the better . So Annabella is not to have anything to do with Molly Gibson , this visit at any rate . "
255872	255877	255867	255868	Miss Browning	159	" have a temper , "
256122	256180	256111	256112	Miss Browning	159	" Phobe ! either you 've some reason for puffing yourself out with sighs , or you 've not . If you have a reason , it 's your duty to tell it me directly ; and if you have n't a reason , you must break yourself of a bad habit that is growing upon you . "
256181	256219	256111	256112	Miss Browning	159	" Oh , sister ! do you think it is really my duty to tell you ? it would be such a comfort ; but then I thought I ought not ; it will distress you so . "
256220	256303	256111	256112	Miss Browning	159	" Nonsense . I am so well prepared for misfortune by the frequent contemplation of its possibility that I believe I can receive any ill news with apparent equanimity and real resignation . Besides , when you said yesterday at breakfast - time that you meant to give up the day to making your drawers tidy , I was aware that some misfortune was impending , though of course I could not judge of its magnitude . Is the Highchester Bank broken ? "
256304	256310	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Oh no , sister ! "
256328	256357	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Have you really been thinking that ! I wish I had told you what I heard at the very first , if you 've been fancying that ! "
256358	256404	256111	256112	Miss Browning	159	" Take warning , Phobe , and learn to have no concealments from me . I did think we must be ruined , from your ways of going on : eating no meat at dinner , and sighing continually . And now what is it ? "
256405	256421	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" I hardly know how to tell you , Dorothy . I really do n't . "
256444	256476	256428	256429	Miss Browning	159	" Cry as much as you like when you 've told me ; but do n't cry now , child , when you 're keeping me on the tenter - hooks . "
256477	256491	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Molly Gibson has lost her character , sister . That 's it . "
256492	256501	256503	256504	Miss Browning	159	" Molly Gibson has done no such thing ! "
256507	256530	256503	256504	Miss Browning	159	" How dare you repeat such stories about poor Mary 's child ? Never let me hear you say such things again . "
256531	256602	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" I ca n't help it . Mrs. Dawes told me ; and she says it 's all over the town . I told her I did not believe a word of it . And I kept it from you ; and I think I should have been really ill if I 'd kept it to myself any longer . Oh , sister ! what are you going to do ? "
256625	256653	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm going to put on my bonnet and things , and then I shall call upon Mrs. Dawes , and confront her with her lies . "
256654	256723	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Oh , do n't call them lies , sister ; it 's such a strong , ugly word . Please call them tallydiddles , for I do n't believe she meant any harm . Besides besides if they should turn out to be truth ? Really , sister , that 's the weight on my mind ; so many things sounded as if they might be true . "
256724	256728	256730	256731	Miss Browning	159	" What things ? "
256747	256760	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Why one story was that Molly had given him a letter . "
256761	256779	256780	256781	Miss Browning	159	" Who 's him ? How am I to understand a story told in that silly way ? "
256801	256869	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Him is Mr. Preston . And that must be true ; because I missed her from my side when I wanted to ask her if she thought blue would look green by candlelight , as the young man said it would , and she had run across the street , and Mrs. Goodenough was just going into the shop , just as she said she was . "
256884	256917	256880	256880	she	159	" Phobe , I think you 'll drive me mad . Do tell me what you heard from Mrs. Dawes in a sensible and coherent manner , for once in your life . "
256918	256938	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" I 'm sure I 'm trying with all my might to tell you everything just as it happened . "
256939	256948	256880	256880	she	159	" What did you hear from Mrs. Dawes ? "
256949	257117	256312	256313	Miss Phobe	159	" Why , that Molly and Mr. Preston were keeping company just as if she was a maid - servant and he was a gardener : meeting at all sorts of improper times and places , and fainting away in his arms , and out at night together , and writing to each other , and slipping their letters into each other 's hands ; and that was what I was talking about , sister , for I next door to saw that done once . I saw her with my own eyes run across the street to Grinstead 's , where he was , for we had just left him there ; with a letter in her hand , too , which was not there when she came back all fluttered and blushing . But I never thought anything of it at the time ; but now all the town is talking about it , and crying shame , and saying they ought to be married . "
257148	257172	256880	256880	she	159	" Phobe , if ever I hear you say such things again , I 'll turn you out of the house that minute . "
257173	257190	257192	257193	Miss Phobe	159	" I only said what Mrs. Dawes said , and you asked me what it was , "
257199	257209	257192	257193	Miss Phobe	159	" Dorothy , you should not have done that . "
257210	257247	256880	256880	she	159	" Never mind whether I should or I should n't . That 's not the matter in hand . What I 've got to decide is , how to put a stop to all these lies . "
257248	257288	257192	257193	Miss Phobe	159	" But , Dorothy , they are not all lies if you will call them so ; I 'm afraid some things are true ; though I stuck to their being false when Mrs. Dawes told me of them . "
257289	257350	257352	257353	Miss Browning	159	" If I go to Mrs. Dawes , and she repeats them to me , I shall slap her face or box her ears I 'm afraid , for I could n't stand tales being told of poor Mary 's daughter , as if they were just a stirring piece of news like James Horrocks ' pig with two heads , "
257358	257391	257392	257392	Phobe	159	" That would do harm instead of good . Phobe , I 'm really sorry I boxed your ears , only I should do it again if you said the same things . "
257427	257580	257416	257416	her	159	" If I speak to Molly , the child will deny it , if she 's half as good - for - nothing as they say ; and if she 's not , she 'll only worry herself to death . No , that wo n't do . Mrs. Goodenough but she 's a donkey ; and if I convinced her , she could never convince any one else . No ; Mrs. Dawes , who told you , shall tell me , and I 'll tie my hands together inside my muff , and bind myself over to keep the peace . And when I 've heard what is to be heard , I 'll put the matter into Mr. Gibson 's hands . That 's what I 'll do . So it 's no use your saying anything against it , Phobe , for I sha n't attend to you . "
257748	257751	257752	257752	she	450	" Well ! "
257766	257852	257752	257752	she	450	" I 'm very sorry I 've lived till this day ; it 's a blow to me just as if I had heard of such goings - on in my own flesh and blood . I suppose I ought to apologize to you , Mrs. Dawes , for what I said ; but I 've no heart to do it to - day . I ought not to have spoken as I did ; but that 's nothing to this affair , you see . "
257853	257878	257880	257881	Mrs. Dawes	450	" I hope you do me the justice to perceive that I only repeated what I had heard on good authority , Miss Browning , "
257885	257907	257909	257910	Miss Browning	159	" My dear , do n't repeat evil on any authority unless you can do some good by speaking about it , "
257921	257984	257913	257913	her	159	" I 'm not a good woman , but I know what is good , and that advice is . And now I think I can tell you that I beg your pardon for flying out upon you so ; but God knows what pain you were putting me to . You 'll forgive me , wo n't you , my dear ? "
258296	258299	258301	258301	he	238	" Well ! "
258320	258359	258301	258301	he	238	" and what is the matter with us ? It 's Phobe , I suppose ? I hope none of those old spasms ? But , after all , a dose or two will set that to rights . "
258360	258376	258378	258379	Miss Browning	159	" Oh ! Mr. Gibson , I wish it was Phobe , or me either ! "
258410	258455	258394	258394	he	238	" Do n't hurry yourself , take your time . I daresay it 's not so bad as you fancy ; but we 'll see about it . There 's a great deal of help in the world , much as we abuse it . "
258456	258460	258462	258462	she	159	" Mr. Gibson , "
258464	258512	258462	258462	she	159	" it 's your Molly I 'm so grieved about . It 's out now , and God help us both , and the poor child too , for I 'm sure she 's been led astray , and not gone wrong by her own free will ! "
258513	258516	258518	258518	he	5525	" Molly ! "
258525	258536	258518	258518	he	5525	" What 's my little Molly been doing or saying ? "
258537	258573	258462	258462	she	159	" Oh ! Mr. Gibson , I do n't know how to tell you . I never would have named it , if I had not been convinced , sorely , sorely against my will . "
258574	258589	258591	258591	he	5525	" At any rate , you can let me hear what you 've heard , "
258608	258625	258627	258627	he	5525	" Not that I 'm a bit afraid of anything you can hear about my girl , "
258629	258650	258627	258627	he	5525	" Only in this little nest of gossip , it 's as well to know what people are talking about . "
258651	258662	258676	258676	his	5525	" They say oh ! how shall I tell you ? "
258663	258671	258673	258673	he	5525	" Go on , ca n't you ? "
258683	258698	258673	258673	he	5525	" I 'm not going to believe it , so do n't be afraid ! "
258699	258729	258676	258676	his	5525	" But I fear you must believe it . I would not if I could help it . She 's been carrying on a clandestine correspondence with Mr. Preston ! "
258730	258734	258736	258736	he	5525	" Mr. Preston ! "
258738	258780	258781	258782	Mr. Gibson	238	" And meeting him at all sorts of unseemly places and hours , out of doors , in the dark , fainting away in his his arms , if I must speak out . All the town is talking of it . "
258808	258830	258798	258799	Miss Browning	159	" Mr. Sheepshanks saw them together . They have exchanged notes in Grinstead 's shop ; she ran after him there . "
258831	258839	258841	258842	Mr. Gibson	238	" Be quiet , ca n't you ? "
258856	258896	258841	258842	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 've heard enough . Do n't go on . I said I should n't believe it , and I do n't . I suppose I must thank you for telling me ; but I ca n't yet . "
258897	258905	258907	258908	Miss Browning	159	" I do n't want your thanks , "
258913	258949	258907	258908	Miss Browning	159	" I thought you ought to know ; for though you 're married again , I ca n't forget you were dear Mary 's husband once upon a time ; and Molly 's her child . "
258950	258964	258966	258966	he	5526	" I 'd rather not speak any more about it just at present , "
258979	259051	258966	258966	he	5526	" I may not control myself as I ought . I only wish I could meet Preston , and horsewhip him within an inch of his life . I wish I 'd the doctoring of these slanderous gossips . I 'd make their tongues lie still for a while . My little girl ! What harm has she done them all , that they should go and foul her fair name ? "
259052	259097	258907	258908	Miss Browning	159	" Indeed , Mr. Gibson , I 'm afraid it 's all true . I would not have sent for you if I had n't examined into it . Do ascertain the truth before you do anything violent , such as horsewhipping or poisoning . "
259114	259163	259109	259110	Mr. Gibson	238	" What have I said about horsewhipping or poisoning ? Do you think I 'd have Molly 's name dragged about the streets in connection with any act of violence on my part ? Let the report die away as it arose . Time will prove its falsehood . "
259164	259181	259183	259184	Miss Browning	159	" But I do n't think it will , and that 's the pity of it , "
259186	259199	259183	259184	Miss Browning	159	" You must do something , but I do n't know what . "
259200	259239	259240	259240	He	238	" I shall go home and ask Molly herself what 's the meaning of it all ; that 's all I shall do . It 's too ridiculous knowing Molly as I do , it 's perfectly ridiculous . "
259261	259282	259240	259240	He	238	" Really what will they say next ? ' Satan finds some mischief still for idle tongues to do . ' "
259283	259310	259312	259313	Miss Browning	159	" Do n't talk of Satan , please , in this house . No one knows what may happen , if he 's lightly spoken about , "
259327	259352	259315	259315	He	238	" I 've a great mind to leave the place ; and what food for scandal that piece of folly would give rise to ! "
259392	259456	259383	259383	he	238	" I 'm thoroughly ungrateful to you , for as true a mark of friendship as you 've ever shown to me . True or false , it was right I should know the wretched scandal that was being circulated ; and it could n't have been pleasant for you to tell it me . Thank you from the bottom of my heart . "
259457	259480	259508	259508	She	159	" Indeed , Mr. Gibson , if it was false I would never have named it , but let it die away . "
259481	259489	259491	259491	he	238	" It 's not true , though ! "
259513	259525	259526	259526	she	159	" I shall always love Molly for her mother 's sake , "
259551	259581	259508	259508	She	159	" You ought to love her for her own . She has done nothing to disgrace herself . I shall go straight home , and probe into the truth . "
259582	259605	259607	259608	Miss Browning	159	" As if the poor girl who has been led away into deceit already would scruple much at going on in falsehood , "
259698	259723	259693	259693	Maria	147	" Go and tell Miss Molly she 's wanted in the dining - room . Do n't say who it is that wants her . "
259749	259759	259744	259744	Molly	147	" Wants me ? Who is it , Maria ? "
259830	259833	259825	259825	her	147	" Papa ! "
259834	259837	259839	259839	he	238	" Hush ! "
259845	259853	259839	259839	he	238	" Shut the door . Come here . "
259872	259877	259878	259878	she	147	" Is it Osborne ? "
259922	259964	259919	259919	he	238	" Molly , what is this I hear ? That you have been keeping up a clandestine intercourse with Mr. Preston meeting him in out - of - the - way places ; exchanging letters with him in a stealthy way ? "
260233	260236	260238	260238	he	238	" Pooh ! "
260248	260268	260238	260238	he	238	" that is nothing nothing . Answer my question . Have you have you met that man in private ? "
260269	260286	260218	260218	her	147	" Yes , papa , I have ; but I do n't think it was wrong . "
260292	260295	260296	260296	he	238	" Wrong ! "
260301	260359	260296	260296	he	238	" Not wrong ? Well ! I must bear it somehow . Your mother is dead . That 's one comfort . It is true , then , is it ? Why , I did n't believe it not I. I laughed in my sleeve at their credulity ; and I was the dupe all the time ! "
260360	260401	260411	260411	he	238	" Papa , I can not tell you all . It is not my secret , or you should know it directly . Indeed , you will be sorry some time I have never deceived you yet , have I ? "
260431	260434	260436	260436	she	5537	" Papa ! "
260441	260448	260436	260436	she	5537	" have I ever deceived you ? "
260449	260475	260411	260411	he	238	" How can I tell ? I hear of this from the town 's talk . I do n't know what next may come out ! "
260476	260482	260484	260484	Molly	147	" The town 's talk ! "
260488	260496	260484	260484	Molly	147	" What business is it of theirs ? "
260497	260523	260411	260411	he	238	" Every one makes it their business to cast dirt on a girl 's name who has disregarded the commonest rules of modesty and propriety . "
260524	260618	260484	260484	Molly	147	" Papa , you are very hard . Modesty disregarded ! I will tell you exactly what I have done . I met Mr. Preston once , that evening when you put me down to walk over Croston Heath , and there was another person with him . I met him a second time and that time by appointment nobody but our two selves , in the Towers ' Park . That is all , papa . You must trust me . I can not explain more . You must trust me indeed . "
260708	260712	260713	260713	he	5538	" The letters ? "
260730	260807	260720	260720	he	5538	" I gave him one letter , of which I did not write a word , which , in fact , I believe to have been merely an envelope , without any writing whatever inside . The giving that letter , the two interviews I have named , make all the private intercourse I have had with Mr. Preston . Oh ! papa , what have they been saying that has grieved shocked you so much ? "
260808	260848	260713	260713	he	5538	" Never mind . As the world goes , what you say you have done , Molly , is ground enough . You must tell me all . I must be able to refute these rumours point by point . "
260849	260876	260720	260720	he	5538	" How are they to be refuted , when you say that the truth which I have acknowledged is ground enough for what people are saying ? "
260877	260930	260713	260713	he	5538	" You say you were not acting for yourself , but for another . If you tell me who the other was , if you tell me everything out fully , I will do my utmost to screen her for of course I guess it was Cynthia while I am exonerating you . "
260931	260936	260938	260938	Molly	147	" No , papa ! "
260945	260971	260938	260938	Molly	147	" I have told you all I can tell ; all that concerns myself ; and I have promised not to say one word more . "
260972	261010	260720	260720	he	5538	" Then your character will be impugned . It must be , unless the fullest explanation of these secret meetings is given . I 've a great mind to force the whole truth out of Preston himself ! "
261011	261076	260938	260938	Molly	147	" Papa ! once again I beg you to trust me . If you ask Mr. Preston you will very likely hear the whole truth ; but that is just what I have been trying so hard to conceal , for it will only make several people very unhappy if it is known , and the whole affair is over and done with now . "
261077	261171	260720	260720	he	5538	" Not your share in it . Miss Browning sent for me this evening to tell me how people were talking about you . She implied that it was a complete loss of your good name . You do n't know , Molly , how slight a thing may blacken a girl 's reputation for life . I 'd hard work to stand all she said , even though I did n't believe a word of it at the time . And now you 've told me that much of it is true . "
261172	261202	260938	260938	Molly	147	" But I think you are a brave man , papa . And you believe me , do n't you ? We shall outlive these rumours , never fear . "
261203	261218	261220	261220	he	5540	" You do n't know the power of ill - natured tongues , child , "
261222	261320	260938	260938	Molly	147	" Oh , now you 've called me ' child ' again I do n't care for anything . Dear , dear papa , I 'm sure it is best and wisest to take no notice of these speeches . After all , they may not mean them ill - naturedly . I am sure Miss Browning would not . By - and - by they 'll quite forget how much they made out of so little , and even if they do n't , you would not have me break my solemn word , would you ? "
261321	261367	260938	260938	Molly	147	" Perhaps not . But I can not easily forgive the person who , by practising on your generosity , led you into this scrape . You are very young , and look upon these things as merely temporary evils . I have more experience . "
261368	261479	260938	260938	Molly	147	" Still , I do n't see what I can do now , papa . Perhaps I 've been foolish ; but what I did , I did of my own self . It was not suggested to me . And I 'm sure it was not wrong in morals , whatever it might be in judgment . As I said , it 's all over now ; what I did ended the affair , I am thankful to say ; and it was with that object I did it . If people choose to talk about me , I must submit ; and so must you , dear papa . "
261480	261492	261494	261494	he	5541	" Does your mother does Mrs. Gibson know anything about it ? "
261499	261541	260938	260938	Molly	147	" No ; not a bit ; not a word . Pray do n't name it to her . That might lead to more mischief than anything else . I have really told you everything I am at liberty to tell . "
261701	261710	261712	261712	he	238	" Then , what is to be done ? "
261714	261752	261712	261712	he	238	" These reports are abroad , am I to do nothing to contradict them ? Am I to go about smiling and content with all this talk about you , passing from one idle gossip to another ? "
261753	261844	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 'm afraid so . I 'm very sorry , for I never meant you to have known anything about it , and I can see now how it must distress you . But surely when nothing more happens , and nothing comes of what has happened , the wonder and the gossip must die away . I know you believe every word I have said , and that you trust me , papa . Please , for my sake , be patient with all this gossip and cackle . "
261845	261854	261856	261856	he	238	" It will try me hard , Molly , "
261858	261865	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" For my sake , papa ! "
261866	261877	261879	261879	he	238	" I do n't see what else I can do , "
261882	261890	261879	261879	he	238	" unless I get hold of Preston . "
261891	261938	261940	261940	she	5546	" That would be the worst of all . That would make a talk . And , after all , perhaps he was not so very much to blame . Yes ! he was . But he behaved well to me as far as that goes , "
261956	261970	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do n't stir , you have done nothing to be ashamed of . "
261971	262024	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" That 's true . A quarrel between men which drags a woman 's name into notice is to be avoided at any cost . But sooner or later I must have it out with Preston . He shall find it not so pleasant to have placed my daughter in equivocal circumstances . "
262025	262068	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" He did n't place me . He did n't know I was coming , did n't expect to meet me either time ; and would far rather not have taken the letter I gave him if he could have helped himself . "
262069	262086	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It 's all a mystery . I hate to have you mixed up in mysteries . "
262087	262121	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I hate to be mixed up . But what can I do ? I know of another mystery which I 'm pledged not to speak about . I can not help myself . "
262122	262176	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Well , all I can say is , never be the heroine of a mystery that you can avoid , if you ca n't help being an accessory . Then , I suppose , I must yield to your wishes and let this scandal wear itself out without any notice from me ? "
262177	262187	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What else can you do under the circumstances ? "
262188	262202	261658	261659	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ay ; what else , indeed ? How shall you bear it ? "
262253	262281	262246	262246	she	5548	" It 's like tooth - drawing , it will be over some time . It would be much worse if I really had been doing wrong . "
262282	262286	262287	262287	he	5552	" Cynthia shall beware "
262299	262441	262291	262291	Molly	147	" Papa , Cynthia must not be accused , or suspected ; you will drive her out of your house if you do , she is so proud , and so unprotected , except by you . And Roger , for Roger 's sake , you will never do or say anything to send Cynthia away , when he has trusted us all to take care of her , and love her in his absence . Oh ! I think if she were really wicked , and I did not love her at all , I should feel bound to watch over her , he loves her so dearly . And she is really good at heart , and I do love her dearly . You must not vex or hurt Cynthia , papa , remember she is dependent upon you ! "
262442	262493	262602	262602	she	147	" I think the world would get on tolerably well , if there were no women in it . They plague the life out of one . You 've made me forget , amongst you poor old Job Houghton that I ought to have gone to see an hour ago . "
262503	262517	262494	262494	Molly	147	" You 're not angry with me now , papa , are you ? "
262518	262524	262526	262526	her	147	" Get out of my way "
262531	262568	262526	262526	her	147	" If I 'm not angry with you , I ought to be ; for you 've caused a great deal of worry , which wo n't be over yet awhile , I can tell you . "
263335	263340	263342	263342	she	189	" Really , dear ! "
263349	263366	263342	263342	she	189	" I think your hair is getting softer , and losing that disagreeable crisp curly feeling . "
263404	263530	263396	263397	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am so sorry to be the cause of detaining you from this little party , but dear papa is so over - anxious about me . I have always been a kind of pet with gentlemen , and poor Mr. Kirkpatrick never knew how to make enough of me . But I think Mr. Gibson is even more foolishly fond : his last words were , ' Take care of yourself , Hyacinth ; ' and then he came back again to say , ' If you do n't attend to my directions I wo n't answer for the consequences . ' I shook my forefinger at him , and said , ' Do n't be so anxious , you silly man . ' "
263531	263544	263546	263546	Molly	147	" I hope we have done everything he told us to do , "
263548	263681	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh yes ! I feel so much better . Do you know , late as it is , I think you might go to Mrs. Goodenough 's yet ? Maria could take you , and I should like to see you dressed ; when one has been wearing dull warm gowns for a week or two one gets quite a craving for bright colours , and evening dress . So go and get ready , dear , and then perhaps you 'll bring me back some news , for really , shut up as I have been with only papa and you for the last fortnight , I 've got quite moped and dismal , and I ca n't bear to keep young people from the gaieties suitable to their age . "
263682	263697	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , pray , mamma ! I had so much rather not go ! "
263698	263730	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Very well ! very well ! Only I think it is rather selfish of you , when you see I am so willing to make the sacrifice for your sake . "
263731	263750	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But you say it is a sacrifice to you , and I do n't want to go . "
263751	263781	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Very well ; did I not say you might stop at home ? only pray do n't chop logic ; nothing is so fatiguing to a sick person . "
263802	263815	263790	263791	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ca n't you think of anything amusing to say , Molly ? "
263858	263866	263856	263856	she	189	" I wish Cynthia was at home . "
263879	263892	263856	263856	she	189	" Shall I write to her and ask her to come back ? "
263893	263925	263856	263856	she	189	" Well , I 'm not sure ; I wish I knew a great many things . You 've not heard anything of poor dear Osborne Hamley lately , have you ? "
263956	264134	263950	263951	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You see , if Mr. Henderson has been as attentive as he was in the spring and the chances about Roger I shall be really grieved if anything happens to that young man , uncouth as he is , but it must be owned that Africa is not merely an unhealthy it is a savage and even in some parts a cannibal country . I often think of all I 've read of it in geography books , as I lie awake at night , and if Mr. Henderson is really becoming attached ! The future is hidden from us by infinite wisdom , Molly , or else I should like to know it ; one would calculate one 's behaviour at the present time so much better if one only knew what events were to come . But I think , on the whole , we had better not alarm Cynthia . If we had only known in time we might have planned for her to have come down with Lord Cumnor and my lady . "
264135	264148	263950	263951	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Are they coming ? Is Lady Cumnor well enough to travel ? "
264149	264198	263950	263951	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes , to be sure ; or else I should not have considered whether or no Cynthia could have come down with them . It would have sounded very well more than respectable , and would have given her a position among that lawyer set in London . "
264199	264206	263950	263951	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Then Lady Cumnor is better ? "
264207	264299	263950	263951	Mrs. Gibson	189	" To be sure . I should have thought papa would have mentioned it to you ; but , to be sure , he is always so scrupulously careful not to speak about his patients . Quite right too quite right and delicate . Why , he hardly ever tells me how they are going on . Yes ! the Earl and the Countess , and Lady Harriet and Lord and Lady Cuxhaven , and Lady Agnes ; and I 've ordered a new winter bonnet and a black satin cloak . "
264369	264372	264360	264362	an invalid peeress	5588	" the family "
265078	265109	265110	265110	he	1223	" I beg your pardon , my lady , I 'm later than I should have been , I know . Why ! have n't you had your tea yet ? "
265123	265136	265138	265138	she	995	" You know I never take cream before I 've sweetened it , "
265146	265148	265074	265074	he	1223	" never "
265152	265189	265210	265210	her	995	" Oh , dear ! What a simpleton I am ! I think I might have remembered it by this time . You see I met old Sheepshanks , and that 's the reason of it . "
265190	265201	265203	265204	his wife	995	" Of your handing me the cream before the sugar ? "
265214	265267	265210	265210	her	995	" No , no ! ha , ha ! You 're better this evening , I think , my dear . But , as I was saying , Sheepshanks is such an eternal talker , there 's no getting away from him , and I had no idea it was so late ! "
265268	265297	265210	265210	her	995	" Well , I think the least you can do is to tell us something of Mr. Sheepshanks ' conversation now you have torn yourself away from him . "
265298	265404	265210	265210	her	995	" Conversation ! did I call it conversation ? I do n't think I said much . I listened . He really has always a great deal to say . More than Preston , for instance . And , by the way , he was telling me something about Preston ; old Sheepshanks thinks he 'll be married before long , he says there 's a great deal of gossip going on about him and Gibson 's daughter . They 've been caught meeting in the park , and corresponding , and all that kind of thing that is likely to end in a marriage . "
265405	265412	265414	265415	Lady Harriet	168	" I shall be very sorry , "
265417	265436	265414	265415	Lady Harriet	168	" I always liked that girl ; and I ca n't bear papa 's model land - agent . "
265437	265445	265447	265448	Lady Cumnor	150	" I daresay it 's not true , "
265459	265472	265447	265448	Lady Cumnor	150	" Papa picks up stories one day to contradict them the next . "
265473	265508	265210	265210	her	995	" Ah , but this did sound like truth . Sheepshanks said all the old ladies in the town had got hold of it , and were making a great scandal out of it . "
265509	265535	265537	265538	Lady Cuxhaven	162	" I do n't think it does sound quite a nice story . I wonder what Clare could be doing to allow such goings on , "
265540	265566	265568	265569	Lady Harriet	168	" I think it is much more likely that Clare 's own daughter that pretty pawky Miss Kirkpatrick is the real heroine of this story , "
265571	265697	265568	265569	Lady Harriet	168	" She always looks like a heroine of genteel comedy ; and those young ladies were capable of a good deal of innocent intriguing , if I remember rightly . Now little Molly Gibson has a certain gaucherie about her which would disqualify her at once from any clandestine proceedings . Besides , ' clandestine ! ' why , the child is truth itself . Papa , are you sure Mr. Sheepshanks said it was Miss Gibson that was exciting Hollingford scandal ? Was n't it Miss Kirkpatrick ? The notion of her and Mr. Preston making a match of it does n't sound so incongruous ; but if it 's my little friend Molly , I 'll go to church and forbid the banns . "
265698	265722	265899	265899	she	168	" Really , Harriet , I ca n't think what always makes you take such an interest in all these petty Hollingford affairs . "
265723	265857	265568	265569	Lady Harriet	168	" Mamma , it 's only tit for tat . They take the most lively interest in all our sayings and doings . If I were going to be married , they would want to know every possible particular , when we first met , what we first said to each other , what I wore , and whether he offered by letter or in person . I 'm sure those good Miss Brownings were wonderfully well - informed as to Mary 's methods of managing her nursery , and educating her girls ; so it 's only a proper return of the compliment to want to know on our side how they are going on . I 'm quite of papa 's faction . I like to hear all the local gossip . "
265858	265877	265879	265880	Lady Cumnor	150	" Especially when it is flavoured with a spice of scandal and impropriety , as in this case , "
265912	265961	265899	265899	she	168	" I am really interested in this story about Molly Gibson , I own . I both like and respect her ; and I do not like to hear her name coupled with that of Mr. Preston . I ca n't help fancying papa has made some mistake . "
265962	266110	265899	265899	she	168	" No , my dear . I 'm sure I 'm repeating what I heard . I 'm sorry I said anything about it , if it annoys you or my lady there . Sheepshanks did say Miss Gibson , though , and he went on to say it was a pity the girl had got herself so talked about ; for it was the way they had carried on that gave rise to all the chatter . Preston himself was a very fair match for her , and nobody could have objected to it . But I 'll try and find a more agreeable piece of news . Old Margery at the lodge is dead ; and they do n't know where to find some one to teach clear - starching at your school ; and Robert Hall made forty pounds last year by his apples . "
266140	266189	266127	266127	she	168	" I warned her against him the day of her father 's wedding . And what a straightforward , out - spoken topic it was then ! I do n't believe it ; it 's only one of old Sheepshanks ' stories , half invention and half deafness . "
266300	266317	266292	266292	she	168	" What is all this I hear about my little friend Molly Gibson and Mr. Preston ? "
266318	266335	266292	266292	she	168	" Oh , Lady Harriet ! have you heard of it ? We are so sorry ! "
266336	266341	266292	266292	she	168	" Sorry for what ? "
266342	266367	266369	266370	Miss Browning	159	" I think , begging your ladyship 's pardon , we had better not say any more till we know how much you know , "
266372	266375	266377	266378	Lady Harriet	168	" Nay , "
266384	266410	266377	266378	Lady Harriet	168	" I sha n't tell what I know till I am sure you know more . Then we 'll make an exchange if you like . "
266411	266424	266426	266427	Miss Browning	159	" I 'm afraid it 's no laughing matter for poor Molly , "
266433	266440	266430	266430	her	159	" People do say such things ! "
266441	266454	266457	266458	Miss Phobe	159	" But I do n't believe them ; indeed I do n't , "
266463	266471	266473	266474	Lady Harriet	168	" No more will I , then , "
266483	266521	266430	266430	her	159	" It 's all very fine , Phobe , saying you do n't believe them , but I should like to know who it was that convinced me , sadly against my will , I am sure . "
266522	266620	266624	266625	Miss Phobe	159	" I only told you the facts as Mrs. Goodenough told them me , sister ; but I 'm sure if you had seen poor patient Molly as I have done , sitting up in a corner of a room , looking at the Beauties of England and Wales till she must have been sick of them , and no one speaking to her ; and she as gentle and sweet as ever at the end of the evening , though maybe a bit pale facts or no facts , I wo n't believe anything against her . "
266633	266648	266650	266651	Lady Harriet	168	" And , as I said before , I 'm quite of your opinion , "
266653	266677	266679	266680	Miss Browning	159	" But how does your ladyship explain away her meetings with Mr. Preston in all sorts of unlikely and open - air places ? "
266716	266756	266702	266702	she	159	" I went so far as to send for her father and tell him all about it . I thought at least he would have horsewhipped Mr. Preston ; but he seems to have taken no notice of it . "
266757	266776	266778	266779	Lady Harriet	168	" Then we may be quite sure he knows some way of explaining matters that we do n't , "
266783	266800	266778	266779	Lady Harriet	168	" After all , there may be a hundred and fifty perfectly natural and justifiable explanations . "
266801	266818	266820	266821	Miss Browning	159	" Mr. Gibson knew of none when I thought it my duty to speak to him , "
266823	266843	266702	266702	she	159	" Why , suppose that Mr. Preston is engaged to Miss Kirkpatrick , and Molly is confidante and messenger ? "
266844	266894	266702	266702	she	159	" I do n't see that your ladyship 's supposition much alters the blame . Why , if he is honourably engaged to Cynthia Kirkpatrick , does he not visit her openly at her home in Mr. Gibson 's house ? Why does Molly lend herself to clandestine proceedings ? "
266895	266903	266905	266906	Lady Harriet	168	" One ca n't account for everything , "
266920	267042	266905	266906	Lady Harriet	168	" But I choose to have faith in Molly Gibson . I 'm sure she 's not done anything very wrong . I 've a great mind to go and call on her Mrs. Gibson is confined to her room with this horrid influenza and take her with me on a round of calls through this little gossiping town , on Mrs. Goodenough , or Badenough , who seems to have been propagating all these stories . But I 've not time to - day . I 've to meet papa at three , and it 's three now . Only remember , Miss Phobe , it 's you and I against the world , in defence of a distressed damsel . "
267043	267050	267052	267052	she	5628	" Don Quixote and Sancho Panza ! "
267068	267083	267085	267086	Miss Browning	159	" Now , I do n't think that 's pretty of you , Phobe , "
267101	267182	267085	267086	Miss Browning	159	" First , you convince me against my will , and make me very unhappy ; and I have to do unpleasant things , all because you 've made me believe that certain statements are true ; and then you turn round and cry , and say you do n't believe a word of it all , making me out a regular ogre and backbiter . No ! it 's of no use . I sha n't listen to you . "
267315	267367	267294	267295	The earl	6640	" Aha ! here 's Preston . Good - day to you . I was just wanting to ask you about that slip of pasture - land on the Home Farm . John Brickkill wants to plough it up and crop it . It 's not two acres at the best . "
267396	267427	267393	267393	she	168	" Mr. Preston , perhaps you will allow me to ask you one or two questions to relieve my mind , for I am in some little perplexity at present . "
267447	267465	267444	267444	Click	216	" Certainly ; I shall only be too happy to give you any information in my power . "
267531	267560	267518	267518	she	147	" There are reports about Miss Gibson and you current among the gossips of Hollingford . Are we to congratulate you on your engagement to that young lady ? "
267561	267578	267580	267581	Lord Cumnor	153	" Ah ! by the way , Preston , we ought to have done it before , "
267593	267610	267588	267589	his daughter	1390	" Mr. Preston has not yet told us if the reports are well founded , papa . "
267631	267638	267640	267640	he	153	" I am not so fortunate , "
267654	267662	267664	267665	Lady Harriet	168	" Then I may contradict that report ? "
267668	267699	267664	267665	Lady Harriet	168	" Or is there any reason for believing that in time it may come true ? I ask because such reports , if unfounded , do harm to young ladies . "
267700	267706	267718	267718	his	153	" Keep other sweethearts off , "
267727	267738	267722	267723	Lady Harriet	168	" And I take a great interest in Miss Gibson . "
267748	267753	267746	267746	he	247	" in for it , "
267774	267811	267812	267812	He	247	" I have no expectation or hope of ever having a nearer interest in Miss Gibson than I have at present . I shall be glad if this straightforward answer relieves your ladyship from your perplexity . "
267916	267970	267897	267897	she	168	" Then , sir ! are you aware of the injury you may do to a young lady 's reputation if you meet her , and detain her in long conversations , when she is walking by herself , unaccompanied by any one ? You give rise you have given rise to reports . "
267971	267995	267897	267897	she	168	" My dear Harriet , are not you going too far ? You do n't know Mr. Preston may have intentions unacknowledged intentions . "
267996	268125	267897	267897	she	168	" No , my lord . I have no intentions with regard to Miss Gibson . She may be a very worthy young lady I have no doubt she is . Lady Harriet seems determined to push me into such a position that I can not but acknowledge myself to be it is not enviable not pleasant to own but I am , in fact , a jilted man ; jilted by Miss Kirkpatrick , after a tolerably long engagement . My interviews with Miss Gibson were not of the most agreeable kind as you may conclude when I tell you she was , I believe , the instigator certainly , she was the agent in this last step of Miss Kirkpatrick 's . Is your ladyship 's curiosity "
268143	268143	267897	267897	she	168	"
268144	268168	267897	267897	she	168	" Harriet , my dear , you 've gone too far we had no right to pry into Mr. Preston 's private affairs . "
268169	268175	268177	268178	Lady Harriet	168	" No more I had , "
268243	268253	268255	268255	she	168	" But he will excuse me , I hope , "
268288	268346	268255	268255	she	168	" when he learns that the busy tongues of the Hollingford ladies have been speaking of my friend , Miss Gibson , in the most unwarrantable manner ; drawing unjustifiable inferences from the facts of that intercourse with Mr. Preston , the nature of which he has just conferred such a real obligation on me by explaining . "
268347	268365	268367	268368	Mr. Preston	247	" I think I need hardly request Lady Harriet to consider this explanation of mine as confidential , "
268370	268377	268379	268380	the earl	6640	" Of course , of course ! "
268382	268389	268379	268380	the earl	6640	" every one will understand that . "
268538	268546	268548	268548	she	168	" Perhaps , it 's as well , "
268556	268573	268548	268548	she	168	" I 'll leave my card , and put your name down underneath it , Molly . "
268604	268641	268584	268584	she	162	" Please , Lady Harriet I never leave cards ; I have not got any , and on the Miss Brownings , of all people ; why , I am in and out whenever I like . "
268642	268664	268584	268584	she	162	" Never mind , little one . To - day you shall do everything properly , and according to full etiquette . "
268665	268739	268742	268743	Lady Harriet	168	" And now tell Mrs. Gibson to come out to the Towers for a long day ; we will send the carriage for her whenever she will let us know that she is strong enough to come . Indeed , she had better come for a few days ; at this time of the year it does n't do for an invalid to be out in the evenings , even in a carriage . "
268770	268851	268853	268853	she	168	" You 'll tell her , dear , that I came partly to see her but that finding her asleep , I ran off with you , and do n't forget about her coming to stay with us for change of air mamma will like it , I 'm sure and the carriage , and all that . And now good - by , we 've done a good day 's work ! And better than you 're aware of , "
268868	268903	268853	268853	she	168	" Hollingford is not the place I take it to be , if it does n't veer round in Miss Gibson 's favour after my to - day 's trotting of that child about . "
269062	269066	269068	269068	Cynthia	247	" After all , "
269070	269114	269068	269068	Cynthia	247	" there 's a look of home about these rooms which is very pleasant . But I wish I could see you looking stronger , mamma ! that 's the only unpleasant thing . Molly , why did n't you send for me ? "
269115	269121	269123	269123	Molly	162	" I wanted to do , "
269124	269132	269134	269135	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But I would n't let her , "
269137	269197	269134	269135	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You were much better in London than here , for you could have done me no good ; and your letters were very agreeable to read ; and now Helen is better , and I 'm nearly well , and you 've come home just at the right time , for everybody is full of the Charity Ball . "
269198	269209	269211	269211	Cynthia	247	" But we are not going this year , mamma , "
269214	269239	269211	269211	Cynthia	247	" It 's on the 25th , is n't it ? and I 'm sure you 'll never be well enough to take us . "
269240	269256	269258	269259	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You really seem determined to make me out worse than I am , child , "
269495	269533	269487	269487	she	189	" Ah , Molly , you must let my goodness lie fallow for a while ! It has borne such a wonderful crop this year . I have been so pretty - behaved if you knew all ! "
269536	269628	269487	269487	she	189	" Really , Molly , my virtue must come down from the clouds ! It was strained to the utmost in London and I find it is like a kite after soaring aloft for some time , it suddenly comes down , and gets tangled in all sorts of briars and brambles ; which things are an allegory , unless you can bring yourself to believe in my extraordinary goodness while I was away giving me a sort of right to fall foul of all mamma 's briars and brambles now . "
269797	269831	269778	269778	she	189	" I 've had a letter from aunt Kirkpatrick , Cynthia . She sends me my dividends , your uncle is so busy . But what does she mean by this , Cynthia ? "
269892	269921	269876	269876	She	252	" It means mamma , I may as well tell you at once Mr. Henderson offered to me while I was in London , and I refused him . "
269922	269983	269876	269876	She	252	" Refused him and you never told me , but let me hear it by chance ! Really , Cynthia , I think you 're very unkind . And pray what made you refuse Mr. Henderson ? Such a fine young man , and such a gentleman ! Your uncle told me he had a very good private fortune besides . "
269984	269999	270001	270001	Cynthia	252	" Mamma , do you forget that I have promised to marry Roger Hamley ? "
270004	270065	269876	269876	She	252	" No ! of course I do n't how can I , with Molly always dinning the word ' engagement ' into my ears ? But really , when one considers all the uncertainties , and after all it was not a distinct promise , he seemed almost as if he might have looked forward to something of this sort . "
270066	270073	270075	270075	Cynthia	252	" Of what sort , mamma ? "
270079	270117	270118	270118	Cynthia	252	" Why , of a more eligible offer . He must have known you might change your mind , and meet with some one you liked better : so little as you had seen of the world . "
270131	270173	270174	270174	She	552	" I never said I liked him better , how can you talk so , mamma ? I 'm going to marry Roger , and there 's an end of it . I will not be spoken to about it again . "
270182	270304	270174	270174	She	552	" Going to marry Roger ! That 's all very fine . But who is to guarantee his coming back alive ? And if he does , what have they to marry upon , I should like to know ? I do n't wish her to have accepted Mr. Henderson , though I am sure she liked him ; and true love ought to have its course , and not be thwarted ; but she need not have quite finally refused him until well , until we had seen how matters turn out . Such an invalid as I am too ! It has given me quite a palpitation at the heart . I do call it quite unfeeling of Cynthia . "
270305	270308	270310	270310	Molly	162	" Certainly , "
270389	270414	270386	270386	Cynthia	252	" Well , Molly , and now you know all ! I 've been longing to tell you and yet somehow I could not . "
270415	270426	270428	270428	Molly	162	" I suppose it was a repetition of Mr. Coxe , "
270432	270445	270428	270428	Molly	162	" You were agreeable , and he took it for something more . "
270446	270452	270454	270454	Cynthia	252	" I do n't know , "
270456	270500	270454	270454	Cynthia	252	" I mean I do n't know if I was agreeable or not . He was very kind very pleasant but I did not expect it all to end as it did . However , it 's of no use thinking of it . "
270501	270504	270506	270506	Molly	162	" No ! "
270784	270849	270850	270850	Clare	256	" and the visit to the Towers was not , on the whole , quite so happy a one as she had anticipated . Lady Cuxhaven and Lady Harriet , each aware of their mother 's state of health and temper , but only alluding to it as slightly as was absolutely necessary in their conversations with each other , took care not to leave "
270851	270995	271206	271207	Mrs. Gibson	189	" too long with Lady Cumnor ; but several times when one or the other went to relieve guard they found Clare in tears , and Lady Cumnor holding forth on some point on which she had been meditating during the silent hours of her illness , and on which she seemed to consider herself born to set the world to rights . Mrs. Gibson was always apt to consider these remarks as addressed with a personal direction at some error of her own , and defended the fault in question with a sense of property in it , whatever it might happen to be . The second and the last day of her stay at the Towers , Lady Harriet came in , and found her mother haranguing in an excited tone of voice , and Clare looking submissive and miserable and oppressed .
270996	271013	270850	270850	Clare	256	" What 's the matter , dear mamma ? Are not you tiring yourself with talking ? "
271014	271175	271206	271207	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No , not at all ! I was only speaking of the folly of people dressing above their station . I began by telling Clare of the fashions of my grandmother 's days , when every class had a sort of costume of its own , and servants did not ape tradespeople , nor tradespeople professional men , and so on , and what must the foolish woman do but begin to justify her own dress , as if I had been accusing her , or even thinking about her at all . Such nonsense ! Really , Clare , your husband has spoilt you sadly , if you ca n't listen to any one without thinking they are alluding to you . People may flatter themselves just as much by thinking that their faults are always present to other people 's minds , as if they believe that the world is always contemplating their individual charms and virtues . "
271176	271204	271206	271207	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I was told , Lady Cumnor , that this silk was reduced in price . I bought it at Waterloo House after the season was over , "
271235	271290	271206	271207	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Again , Clare ! How often must I tell you I had no thought of you or your gowns , or whether they cost much or little ; your husband has to pay for them , and it is his concern if you spend more on your dress than you ought to do . "
271291	271302	271304	271305	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It was only five guineas for the whole dress , "
271307	271314	271316	271317	Lady Harriet	168	" And very pretty it is , "
271340	271398	271335	271336	Lady Cumnor	150	" No ! you ought to have known me better by this time . When I think a thing I say it out . I do n't beat about the bush . I use straightforward language . I will tell you where I think you have been in fault , Clare , if you like to know . "
271412	271457	271335	271336	Lady Cumnor	150	" You have spoilt that girl of yours till she does not know her own mind . She has behaved abominably to Mr. Preston ; and it is all in consequence of the faults in her education . You have much to answer for . "
271458	271463	271465	271466	Lady Harriet	168	" Mamma , mamma ! "
271468	271478	271465	271466	Lady Harriet	168	" Mr. Preston did not wish it spoken about . "
271488	271493	271484	271485	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Cynthia Mr. Preston ! "
271542	271570	271572	271573	Lady Cumnor	150	" As for Mr. Preston 's wishes , I do not suppose I am bound to regard them when I feel it my duty to reprove error , "
271579	271792	271572	271573	Lady Cumnor	150	" And , Clare , do you mean to say that you are not aware that your daughter has been engaged to Mr. Preston for some time years , I believe , and has at last chosen to break it off , and has used the Gibson girl I forget her name as a cat's - paw , and made both her and herself the town 's talk the butt for all the gossip of Hollingford ? I remember when I was young there was a girl called Jilting Jessy . You 'll have to watch over your young lady , or she will get some such name . I speak to you like a friend , Clare , when I tell you it 's my opinion that girl of yours will get herself into some more mischief yet before she 's safely married . Not that I care one straw for Mr. Preston 's feelings . I do n't even know if he 's got feelings or not ; but I know what is becoming in a young woman , and jilting is not . And now you may both go away , and send Bradley to me , for I 'm tired , and want to have a little sleep . "
271793	271824	271865	271865	she	168	" Indeed , Lady Cumnor will you believe me ? I do not think Cynthia was ever engaged to Mr. Preston . There was an old flirtation . I was afraid "
271825	271832	271834	271835	Lady Cumnor	150	" Ring the bell for Bradley , "
271903	272021	271899	271900	Lady Harriet	168	" Now , Clare , I 'll tell you all about it ; and I think you 'll have to believe it , for it was Mr. Preston himself who told me . I heard of a great commotion in Hollingford about Mr. Preston ; and I met him riding out , and asked him what it was all about ; he did n't want to speak about it , evidently . No man does , I suppose , when he 's been jilted ; and he made both papa and me promise not to tell ; but papa did and that 's what mamma has for a foundation ; you see , a really good one . "
272022	272060	271865	271865	she	168	" But Cynthia is engaged to another man she really is . And another a very good match indeed has just been offering to her in London . Mr. Preston is always at the root of mischief . "
272061	272141	271899	271900	Lady Harriet	168	" Nay ! I do think in this case it must be that pretty Miss Cynthia of yours who has drawn on one man to be engaged to her , not to say two , and another to make her an offer . I ca n't endure Mr. Preston , but I think it 's rather hard to accuse him of having called up the rivals , who are , I suppose , the occasion of his being jilted . "
272142	272192	271865	271865	she	168	" I do n't know ; I always feel as if he owed me a grudge , and men have so many ways of being spiteful . You must acknowledge that if he had not met you I should not have had dear Lady Cumnor so angry with me . "
272193	272233	271899	271900	Lady Harriet	168	" She only wanted to warn you about Cynthia . Mamma has always been very particular about her own daughters . She has been very severe on the least approach to flirting , and Mary will be like her ! "
272234	272284	271865	271865	she	168	" But Cynthia will flirt , and I ca n't help it . She is not noisy , or giggling ; she is always a lady that everybody must own . But she has a way of attracting men , she must have inherited from me , I think . "
272304	272358	272287	272287	she	5680	" However , I will speak to her ; I will get to the bottom of the whole affair . Pray tell Lady Cumnor that it has so fluttered me the way she spoke , about my dress and all . And it only cost five guineas after all , reduced from eight ! "
272359	272401	272404	272405	Lady Cumnor	150	" Well , never mind now . You are looking very much flushed ; quite feverish ! I left you too long in mamma 's hot room . But do you know she is so much pleased to have you here ? "
272418	272421	272416	272416	she	150	" Clare , "
272712	272738	272739	272739	she	150	" Well , mamma , how are you ? We did n't expect you so early ! Let me take off your bonnet and shawl ! "
272743	272760	272739	272739	she	150	" It has not been such a happy visit that I should wish to prolong it . "
272785	272792	272794	272794	Cynthia	247	" What has been the matter ? "
272801	272826	272770	272770	her	150	" You ! Cynthia you ! I little thought when you were born how I should have to bear to hear you spoken about . "
272841	272860	272770	272770	her	150	" What business have they with me ? How came they to talk about me in any way ? "
272861	272906	272770	272770	her	150	" Everybody is talking about you ; it is no wonder they are . Lord Cumnor is sure to hear about everything always . You should take more care about what you do , Cynthia , if you do n't like being talked about . "
272907	272916	272918	272918	Cynthia	247	" It rather depends upon what people say , "
272939	273028	272770	272770	her	150	" Well ! I do n't like it , at any rate . It is not pleasant to me to hear first of my daughter 's misdoings from Lady Cumnor , and then to be lectured about her , and her flirting , and her jilting , as if I had had anything to do with it . I can assure you it has quite spoilt my visit . No ! do n't touch my shawl . When I go to my room I can take it myself . "
273053	273085	273087	273088	the girl	852	" Would you mind telling me what they said ? If there are accusations abroad against me , it is as well I should know what they are . Here 's Molly "
273100	273173	273087	273088	the girl	852	" Molly , mamma has come back from the Towers , and my lord and my lady have been doing me the honour to talk over my crimes and misdemeanors , and I am asking mamma what they have said . I do n't set up for more virtue than other people , but I ca n't make out what an earl and a countess have to do with poor little me . "
273174	273182	273184	273185	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It was not for your sake ! "
273187	273215	273184	273185	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It was for mine . They felt for me , for it is not pleasant to have one 's child 's name in everybody 's mouth . "
273216	273266	273087	273088	the girl	852	" As I said before , that depends upon how it is in everybody 's mouth . If I were going to marry Lord Hollingford , I make no doubt every one would be talking about me , and neither you nor I should mind it in the least . "
273267	273313	273184	273185	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But this is no marriage with Lord Hollingford , so it is nonsense to talk as if it was . They say you 've gone and engaged yourself to Mr. Preston , and now refuse to marry him ; and they call that jilting . "
273314	273325	273327	273327	Cynthia	247	" Do you wish me to marry him , mamma ? "
273375	273378	273380	273381	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No , "
273389	273438	273380	273381	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Of course I do n't ; you have gone and entangled yourself with Roger Hamley , a very worthy young man ; but nobody knows where he is , and if he 's dead or alive ; and he has not a penny if he is alive . "
273439	273486	273488	273488	Cynthia	247	" I beg your pardon . I know that he has some fortune from his mother ; it may not be much , but he is not penniless ; and he is sure to earn fame and great reputation , and with it money will come , "
273490	273517	273518	273519	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You 've entangled yourself with him , and you 've done something of the sort with Mr. Preston , and got yourself into such an imbroglio "
273524	273526	273518	273519	Mrs. Gibson	189	" mess "
273540	273589	273518	273519	Mrs. Gibson	189	" that when a really eligible person comes forward handsome , agreeable , and quite the gentleman and a good private fortune into the bargain , you have to refuse him . You 'll end as an old maid , Cynthia , and it will break my heart . "
273590	273596	273598	273598	Cynthia	247	" I daresay I shall , "
273602	273619	273620	273620	She	189	" I sometimes think I 'm the kind of person of which old maids are made ! "
273634	273668	273629	273630	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't want to know your secrets as long as they are secrets ; but when all the town is talking about you , I think I ought to be told . "
273669	273700	273518	273519	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But , mamma , I did n't know I was such a subject of conversation ; and even now I ca n't make out how it has come about . "
273701	273770	273629	273630	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No more can I. I only know that they say you 've been engaged to Mr. Preston , and ought to have married him , and that I ca n't help it , if you did not choose , any more than I could have helped your refusing Mr. Henderson ; and yet I am constantly blamed for your misconduct . I think it 's very hard . "
273784	273794	273796	273796	he	1223	" You here , my dear ! Welcome back , "
273809	273819	273796	273796	he	1223	" Why , what 's the matter ? Tears ? "
273828	273831	273833	273833	she	189	" Yes ! "
273851	273912	273833	273833	she	189	" I 'm come home again , and I 'm telling Cynthia how Lady Cumnor has been so cross to me , and all through her . Did you know she had gone and engaged herself to Mr. Preston , and then broken it off ? Everybody is talking about it , and they know it up at the Towers . "
273964	273967	273969	273969	he	1223	" Cynthia , "
273974	273977	273978	273978	she	5701	" Yes ! "
273983	274022	274028	274028	she	5701	" Is this true ? I had heard something of it before not much ; but there is scandal enough about to make it desirable that you should have some protector some friend who knows the whole truth . "
274031	274037	274028	274028	she	5701	" Molly knows it all . "
274091	274127	274082	274083	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes ! I know that Molly knows it all , and that she has had to bear slander and ill words for your sake , Cynthia . But she refused to tell me more . "
274128	274138	274140	274140	Cynthia	247	" She told you that much , did she ? "
274144	274151	274153	274153	Molly	162	" I could not help it , "
274155	274163	274165	274166	Mr. Gibson	238	" She did n't name your name , "
274168	274189	274165	274166	Mr. Gibson	238	" At the time I believe she thought she had concealed it but there was no mistaking who it was . "
274190	274200	274202	274202	Cynthia	247	" Why did she speak about it at all ? "
274219	274290	274165	274166	Mr. Gibson	238	" It was necessary for her to justify herself to me I heard my daughter 's reputation attacked for the private meetings she had given to Mr. Preston I came to her for an explanation . There 's no need to be ungenerous , Cynthia , because you 've been a flirt and a jilt , even to the degree of dragging Molly 's name down into the same mire . "
274304	274325	274326	274326	He	238	" You say that of me , Mr. Gibson ? Not knowing what the circumstances are , you say that ? "
274375	274378	274379	274379	he	238	" Yes ! "
274382	274492	274379	274379	he	238	" I do say it . You can not tell what evil constructions are put upon actions ever so slightly beyond the bounds of maidenly propriety . I do say that Molly has had a great deal to bear , in consequence of this clandestine engagement of yours , Cynthia there may be extenuating circumstances , I acknowledge but you will need to remember them all to excuse your conduct to Roger Hamley , when he comes home . I asked you to tell me the full truth , in order that until he comes , and has a legal right to protect you , I may do so . "
274496	274502	274504	274504	he	238	" It certainly requires explanation , "
274506	274521	274504	274504	he	238	" Here are you , engaged to two men at once to all appearances ! "
274526	274588	274504	274504	he	238	" To be sure , the gossips of the town have n't yet picked out the fact of Roger Hamley 's being your accepted lover ; but scandal has been resting on Molly , and ought to have rested on you , Cynthia for a concealed engagement to Mr. Preston necessitating meetings in all sorts of places unknown to your friends . "
274589	274592	274594	274594	Molly	162	" Papa , "
274596	274623	274594	274594	Molly	162	" if you knew all you would n't speak so to Cynthia . I wish she would tell you herself all that she has told me . "
274624	274636	274638	274638	he	5705	" I am ready to hear whatever she has to say , "
274644	274684	274641	274641	Cynthia	247	" No ! you have prejudged me ; you have spoken to me as you had no right to speak . I refuse to give you my confidence , or accept your help . People are very cruel to me "
274691	274707	274714	274714	Molly	162	" I did not think you would have been . But I can bear it . "
274735	274740	274742	274742	Molly	162	" Oh , papa ! "
274751	274759	274742	274742	Molly	162	" do let me tell you all . "
274784	274803	274805	274806	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I think , Mr. Gibson , you have been very very unkind to my poor fatherless child , "
274816	274835	274805	274806	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I only wish her poor father had been alive , and all this would never have happened . "
274836	274896	274805	274806	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Very probably . Still I can not see of what either she or you have to complain . Inasmuch as we could , I and mine have sheltered her ! I have loved her ; I do love her almost as if she were my own child as well as Molly , I do not pretend to do . "
274897	274915	274805	274806	Mrs. Gibson	189	" That 's it , Mr. Gibson ! you do not treat her like your own child . "
274955	274969	274948	274949	her father	675	" I do love her almost as if she were my own child . "
274985	274992	274994	274994	Molly	162	" Open to me , please , "
274996	275012	274994	274994	Molly	162	" I have something to say to you I want to see you do open ! "
275013	275016	275018	275018	Cynthia	247	" No ! "
275020	275064	275018	275018	Cynthia	247	" Not now . I am busy . Leave me alone . I do n't want to hear what you have got to say . I do n't want to see you . By - and - by we shall meet , and then "
275090	275098	275086	275086	Cynthia	247	" Are you there still , Molly ? "
275103	275106	275101	275101	Molly	162	" Yes , "
275128	275166	275167	275168	CHAPTER LI	475	" Go away . I can not bear the feeling of your being there waiting and listening . Go downstairs out of the house anywhere away . It is the most you can do for me now . "
275170	275176	275167	275168	CHAPTER LI	475	" TROUBLES NEVER COME ALONE . "
275495	275515	275484	275484	she	195	" I wish you both to know that henceforward all is at an end between me and Roger Hamley . "
275548	275586	275539	275540	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I could have understood this if it had happened three months ago , when you were in London ; but now it 's just nonsense , Cynthia , and you know you do n't mean it ! "
275607	275619	275602	275602	Molly	162	" Cynthia think of him ! It will break his heart ! "
275620	275623	275625	275625	Cynthia	247	" No ! "
275627	275643	275625	275625	Cynthia	247	" it will not . But even if it did I can not help it . "
275644	275653	275655	275655	Molly	162	" All this talk will soon pass away ! "
275657	275668	275655	275655	Molly	162	" and when he knows the truth from your own self "
275669	275776	275779	275779	she	162	" From my own self he shall never hear it . I do not love him well enough to go through the shame of having to excuse myself , to plead that he will reinstate me in his good opinion . Confession may be well ! I can never believe it pleasant but it may be an ease of mind if one makes it to some people , to some person , and it may not be a mortification to sue for forgiveness . I can not tell . All I know is , and I know it clearly , and will act upon it inflexibly that "
275783	275792	275794	275795	her mother	552	" I think you might finish your sentence , "
275804	275956	275957	275957	she	5721	" I can not bear to exculpate myself to Roger Hamley . I will not submit to his thinking less well of me than he has done , however foolish his judgment may have been . I would rather never see him again , for these two reasons . And the truth is , I do not love him . I like him , I respect him ; but I will not marry him . I have written to tell him so . That was merely as a relief to myself , for when or where the letter will reach him And I have written to old Mr. Hamley . The relief is the one good thing come out of it all . It is such a comfort to feel free again . It wearied me so to think of straining up to his goodness . ' Extenuate my conduct ! ' "
276019	276121	276016	276016	she	5721	" And now , Mr. Gibson , I still treat you like a friend , help me to find some home far away , where all the evil talking and gossip mamma tells me of can not find me and follow me . It may be wrong to care for people 's good opinion , but it is me , and I can not alter myself . You , Molly , all the people in the town , I have n't the patience to live through the nine days ' wonder . I want to go away and be a governess . "
276122	276141	276016	276016	she	5721	" But , my dear Cynthia , how soon Roger will be back , a tower of strength ! "
276142	276203	276016	276016	she	5721	" Has not mamma told you I have broken it all off with Roger ? I wrote this morning . I wrote to his father . That letter will reach to - morrow . I wrote to Roger . If he ever receives that letter , I hope to be far away by that time ; in Russia may be . "
276204	276301	276016	276016	she	5721	" Nonsense . An engagement like yours can not be broken off , except by mutual consent . You 've only given others a great deal of pain without freeing yourself . Nor will you wish it in a month 's time . When you come to think calmly , you 'll be glad to think of the stay and support of such a husband as Roger . You have been in fault , and have acted foolishly at first , perhaps wrongly afterwards ; but you do n't want your husband to think you faultless ? "
276302	276308	276310	276310	Cynthia	247	" Yes , I do , "
276312	276376	276310	276310	Cynthia	247	" At any rate , my lover must think me so . And it is just because I do not love him even as so light a thing as I could love , that I feel that I could n't bear to have to tell him I 'm sorry , and stand before him like a chidden child to be admonished and forgiven . "
276377	276393	276016	276016	she	5721	" But here you are , just in such a position before me , Cynthia ! "
276394	276508	276310	276310	Cynthia	247	" Yes ! but I love you better than Roger ; I 've often told Molly so . And I would have told you , if I had n't expected and hoped to leave you all before long . I could see if the recollection of it all came up before your mind ; I could see it in your eyes ; I should know it by instinct . I have a fine instinct for reading the thoughts of others when they refer to me . I almost hate the idea of Roger judging me by his own standard , which was n't made for me , and graciously forgiving me at last . "
276509	276524	276532	276532	he	238	" Then I do believe it 's right for you to break it off , "
276538	276571	276532	276532	he	238	" That poor poor lad ! But it will be best for him too . And he 'll get over it . He has a good strong heart . Poor old Roger ! "
276670	276676	276660	276660	she	5724	" what would have been . "
276677	276692	276694	276695	Mr. Gibson	238	" Still , take till to - morrow before you act upon your decision , "
276699	276723	276694	276695	Mr. Gibson	238	" What faults you have fallen into have been mere girlish faults at first , leading you into much deceit , I grant . "
276724	276738	276740	276740	Cynthia	247	" Do n't give yourself the trouble to define the shades of blackness , "
276744	276900	276740	276740	Cynthia	247	" I 'm not so obtuse but what I know them all better than any one can tell me . And as for my decision I acted upon it at once . It may be long before Roger gets my letter , but I hope he is sure to get it at last , and , as I said , I have let his father know ; it wo n't hurt him ! Oh , sir , I think if I had been differently brought up I should n't have had the sore angry heart I have . Now ! No , do n't ! I do n't want reasoning comfort . I ca n't stand it . I should always have wanted admiration and worship , and men 's good opinion . Those unkind gossips ! To visit Molly with their hard words ! Oh , dear ! I think life is very dreary . "
276960	276965	276966	276966	he	238	" Go to Cynthia ! "
277007	277013	277014	277014	she	5725	" Oh , my darling ! "
277017	277029	277014	277014	she	5725	" I do so love you , dear , dear Cynthia ! "
277069	277087	277066	277066	she	162	" Molly , Roger will marry you ! See if it is n't so ! You two good "
277100	277104	277105	277105	she	162	" Do n't ! "
277116	277134	277108	277108	She	162	" Your husband this morning ! Mine to - night ! What do you take him for ? "
277135	277139	277141	277141	Cynthia	247	" A man ! "
277143	277167	277141	277141	Cynthia	247	" And therefore , if you wo n't let me call him changeable , I 'll coin a word and call him consolable ! "
277202	277208	277210	277210	she	147	" Is n't master here ? "
277219	277222	277224	277224	Cynthia	247	" No ! "
277226	277245	277224	277224	Cynthia	247	" I heard him go out . I heard him shut the front door not five minutes ago . "
277246	277251	277253	277253	Maria	147	" Oh , dear ! "
277255	277289	277253	277253	Maria	147	" And there 's a man come on horseback from Hamley Hall , and he says as Mr. Osborne is dead , and that master must go off to the Squire straight away . "
277290	277295	277297	277297	Cynthia	247	" Osborne Hamley dead ! "
277432	277440	277415	277415	her	147	" Is the doctor coming , Miss ? "
277452	277461	277463	277463	Molly	147	" He is dead , is he not ? "
277470	277508	277463	277463	Molly	147	" I 'm afeard he is , leastways , there 's no doubt according to what they said . But I 've ridden hard ! there may be a chance . Is the doctor coming , Miss ? "
277509	277535	277536	277536	She	147	" He is gone out . They are seeking him , I believe . I will go myself . Oh ! the poor old Squire ! "
277628	277644	277612	277613	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What is it , Molly ? Why , how white you look , child ! "
277645	277650	277767	277767	she	5751	" Where 's papa ? "
277651	277660	277612	277613	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Gone out . What 's the matter ? "
277661	277664	277767	277767	she	5751	" Where ? "
277665	277702	277612	277613	Mrs. Gibson	189	" How should I know ? I was asleep ; Jenny came upstairs on her way to the bedrooms ; she 's a girl who never keeps to her work and Maria takes advantage of her . "
277703	277708	277710	277710	Molly	147	" Jenny , Jenny ! "
277717	277734	277612	277613	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do n't shout , dear , ring the bell . What can be the matter ? "
277735	277740	277742	277742	Molly	147	" Oh , Jenny ! "
277754	277759	277742	277742	Molly	147	" who wanted papa ? "
277780	277786	277788	277789	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What is the matter ? "
277791	277800	277788	277789	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Can nobody speak and answer a question ? "
277801	277807	277809	277809	Cynthia	247	" Osborne Hamley is dead ! "
277813	277864	277788	277789	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Dead ! Osborne ! Poor fellow ! I knew it would be so , though , I was sure of it . But Mr. Gibson can do nothing if he 's dead . Poor young man ! I wonder where Roger is now ? He ought to come home . "
277951	277959	277961	277961	Molly	147	" He will not be long away , "
277963	277984	277961	277961	Molly	147	" or he would have left word where he was going . But oh ! the poor father all alone ! "
278000	278043	277995	277995	she	147	" Go to James , tell him to put the side - saddle I had in November on Nora Creina . Do n't cry , Jenny . There 's no time for that . No one is angry with you . Run ! "
278077	278085	278087	278088	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Why , what in the world , "
278089	278098	278087	278088	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly , what are you thinking about ? "
278122	278167	278170	278171	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am going . I must go . I can not bear to think of him alone . When papa comes back he is sure to go to Hamley , and if I am not wanted , I can come back with him . "
278247	278254	278242	278242	she	147	" all amongst the tangled grass , "
278256	278321	278242	278242	she	147	" the Squire would let none on us touch him : he took him up as if he was a baby ; he had to rest many a time , and once he sate him down on the ground ; but still he kept him in his arms ; but we thought we should ne'er have gotten him up again him and the body . "
278322	278326	278242	278242	she	147	" The body ! "
278490	278557	278481	278481	he	1781	" It 's the old nursery . They carried him there . The Squire broke down at the stair - foot , and they took him to the readiest place . I 'll be bound for it the Squire is there hisself , and old Robin too . They fetched him , as a knowledgable man among dumb beasts , till th ' regular doctor came . "
279025	279032	279034	279034	he	324	" God bless you , Miss , "
279036	279064	279034	279034	he	324	" make him touch a drop o ' this : he 's gone since breakfast without food , and it 's past one in the morning now . "
279194	279202	279188	279188	he	324	" He will never eat again never . "
279283	279289	279291	279291	he	324	" Go downstairs , Molly , "
279304	279312	279295	279295	he	324	" Go into the dining - room . "
279507	279572	279476	279476	Robinson	324	" Drink , Miss. It 's good old Madeira . Your papa said as how you was to eat a bit . Says he , ' My daughter may have to stay here , Mr. Robinson , and she 's young for the work . Persuade her to eat something , or she 'll break down utterly . ' Those was his very words . "
279668	279675	279677	279677	he	238	" He 's gone to bed , "
279681	279728	279677	279677	he	238	" Robinson and I have got him there . But just as I was leaving him he called me back and asked me to let you stop . I 'm sure I do n't know but one does n't like to refuse at such a time . "
279729	279735	279737	279737	Molly	147	" I wish to stay , "
279739	279755	279677	279677	he	238	" Do you ? There 's a good girl . But how will you manage ? "
279756	279769	279770	279770	she	147	" Oh , never mind that . I can manage . Papa , "
279772	279779	279780	279780	She	147	" what did Osborne die of ? "
279793	279865	279677	279677	he	238	" Something wrong about the heart . You would n't understand if I told you . I apprehended it for some time ; but it 's better not to talk of such things at home . When I saw him on Thursday week , he seemed better than I 've seen him for a long time . I told Dr. Nicholls so . But one never can calculate in these complaints . "
279866	279881	279883	279883	Molly	147	" You saw him on Thursday week ? Why , you never mentioned it ! "
279885	279930	279677	279677	he	238	" No . I do n't talk of my patients at home . Besides , I did n't want him to consider me as his doctor , but as a friend . Any alarm about his own health would only have hastened the catastrophe . "
279931	279959	279677	279677	he	238	" Then did n't he know that he was ill ill of a dangerous complaint , I mean : one that might end as it has done ? "
279960	279980	279677	279677	he	238	" No ; certainly not . He would only have been watching his symptoms accelerating matters , in fact . "
279981	279986	279988	279988	Molly	147	" Oh , papa ! "
279992	280003	280004	280005	Mr. Gibson	238	" I 've no time to go into the question , "
280008	280064	280004	280005	Mr. Gibson	238	" And until you know what has to be said on both sides and in every instance , you are not qualified to judge . We must keep our attention on the duties in hand now . You sleep here for the remainder of the night , which is more than half - gone already ? "
280065	280068	279677	279677	he	238	" Yes . "
280069	280103	280004	280005	Mr. Gibson	238	" Promise me to go to bed just as usual . You may not think it , but most likely you 'll go to sleep at once . People do at your age . "
280104	280152	279677	279677	he	238	" Papa , I think I ought to tell you something . I know a great secret of Osborne 's , which I promised solemnly not to tell ; but the last time I saw him I think he must have been afraid of something like this . "
280191	280200	279677	279677	he	238	" I could not help it , papa ! "
280201	280236	280250	280250	her	5792	" No . I know . Go on with what you were saying . You ought to be in bed ; but if you 've a secret on your mind you wo n't sleep . "
280237	280242	280244	280244	she	5792	" Osborne was married , "
280253	280259	280244	280244	she	5792	" That is the secret . "
280260	280271	280250	280250	her	5792	" Married ! Nonsense . What makes you think so ? "
280272	280330	280244	280244	she	5792	" He told me . That 's to say , I was in the library was reading there , some time ago ; and Roger came and spoke to Osborne about his wife . Roger did not see me , but Osborne did . They made me promise secrecy . I do n't think I did wrong . "
280331	280352	280250	280250	her	5792	" Do n't worry yourself about right or wrong just now ; tell me more about it , at once . "
280353	280436	280244	280244	she	5792	" I knew no more till six months ago last November , when you went up to Lady Cumnor . Then he called , and gave me his wife 's address , but still under promise of secrecy ; and , except those two times , and once when Roger just alluded to it , I have never heard any one mention the subject . I think he would have told me more that last time , only Miss Phobe came in . "
280437	280445	280250	280250	her	5792	" Where is this wife of his ? "
280446	280479	280481	280481	Molly	147	" Down in the south ; near Winchester , I think . He said she was a Frenchwoman and a Roman Catholic ; and I think he said she was a servant , "
280483	280486	280487	280488	Her father	675	" Phew ! "
280496	280499	280501	280501	Molly	147	" And , "
280503	280534	280501	280501	Molly	147	" he spoke of a child . Now you know as much as I do , papa , except the address . I have it written down safe at home . "
280584	280587	280589	280589	he	238	" Well ! "
280596	280623	280589	280589	he	238	" nothing can be done to - night ; by to - morrow morning , perhaps , I may find out . Poor little pale face ! "
280634	280643	280589	280589	he	238	" poor , sweet , little pale face ! "
280667	280675	280677	280677	he	238	" He wo n't be up early , "
280682	280712	280677	280677	he	238	" The shock has lowered him too much to be energetic . Send breakfast up to him in his own room . I 'll be here again before ten . "
280726	280731	280732	280732	he	238	" Now , Molly , "
280735	280780	280732	280732	he	238	" you and I must tell him the truth between us . I do n't know how he will take it ; it may comfort him , but I 've very little hope : either way , he ought to know it at once . "
280781	280805	280677	280677	he	238	" Robinson says he has gone into the room again , and he is afraid he has locked the door on the inside . "
280806	280834	280732	280732	he	238	" Never mind . I shall ring the bell , and send up Robinson to say that I am here , and wish to speak to him . "
280840	280856	280857	280857	Robinson	324	" The Squire 's kind love , and could not see Mr. Gibson just then . "
280860	280875	280857	280857	Robinson	324	" It was a long time before he 'd answer at all , sir . "
280876	280896	280897	280898	Mr. Gibson	238	" Go up again , and tell him I can wait his convenience . Now that 's a lie , "
280914	280973	280897	280898	Mr. Gibson	238	" I ought to be far enough away at twelve ; but , if I 'm not much mistaken , the innate habits of a gentleman will make him uneasy at the idea of keeping me waiting his pleasure , and will do more to bring him out of that room into this than any entreaties or reasoning . "
281057	281087	281088	281088	He	1206	" I 'm brought very low , sir . I suppose it 's God 's doing ; but it comes hard upon me . He was my firstborn child . "
281110	281115	281117	281118	Mr. Gibson	238	" Here 's Molly , "
281130	281154	281155	281155	He	1206	" I beg your pardon ; I did not see you at first . My mind is a good deal occupied just now . "
281183	281188	281190	281190	he	675	" Where 's Roger ? "
281192	281204	281205	281205	He	1206	" Is he not likely to be soon at the Cape ? "
281266	281305	281254	281255	the Squire	1206	" You will be glad to have Roger at home as soon as may be , I think , sir . Some months must elapse first ; but I 'm sure he will return as speedily as possible . "
281336	281342	281329	281329	They	5805	" Roger is n't Osborne ! "
281364	281404	281351	281351	He	238	" No ! we know that . I wish that anything that Roger could do , or that I could do , or that any one could do , would comfort you ; but it is past human comfort . "
281405	281420	281422	281423	the Squire	1206	" I do try to say , God 's will be done , sir , "
281444	281457	281441	281441	his	1206	" but it 's harder to be resigned than happy people think . "
281476	281496	281468	281468	himself	1206	" He was my first child , sir ; my eldest son . And of late years we were n't "
281506	281534	281503	281503	he	1206	" we were n't quite as good friends as could be wished ; and I 'm not sure not sure that he knew how I loved him . "
281546	281550	281552	281553	Mr. Gibson	238	" Better so ! "
281557	281581	281552	281553	Mr. Gibson	238	" When he 's a little calmer , do n't be afraid ; tell him all you know , exactly as it happened . "
281624	281641	281642	281643	the Squire	1206	" One day when I was here , at the time of Mrs. Hamley 's last illness "
281650	281734	281646	281646	his	1206	" I was in the library , and Osborne came in . He said he had only come in for a book , and that I was not to mind him , so I went on reading . Presently , Roger came along the flagged garden - path just outside the window which was open . He did not see me in the corner where I was sitting , and said to Osborne , ' Here 's a letter from your wife ! ' "
281770	281777	281767	281767	he	1206	" His wife ! Osborne married ! "
281782	281828	281778	281778	Molly	147	" Osborne was angry with Roger for speaking out before me , and they made me promise never to mention it to any one ; or to allude to it to either of them again . I never named it to papa till last night . "
281829	281833	281835	281836	Mr. Gibson	238	" Go on , "
281838	281851	281835	281836	Mr. Gibson	238	" Tell the Squire about Osborne 's call what you told me ! "
281867	281925	281926	281926	She	147	" Some months ago Osborne called . He was not well , and wanted to see papa . Papa was away , and I was alone . I do n't exactly remember how it came about , but he spoke to me of his wife for the first and only time since the affair in the library . "
281965	281972	281960	281960	he	1206	" Tell me all , everything . "
281982	282009	281960	281960	he	1206	" He said his wife was a good woman , and that he loved her dearly ; but she was a French Roman Catholic , and a "
282045	282045	282036	282036	He	675	"
282046	282051	282053	282054	the Squire	1206	" Well , well ! "
282056	282186	282053	282054	the Squire	1206	" It 's all over now . All over . All past and gone . We 'll not blame him , no ; but I wish he 'd ha ' told me ; he and I to live together with such a secret in one of us . It 's no wonder to me now nothing can be a wonder again , for one never can tell what 's in a man 's heart . Married so long ! and we sitting together at meals and living together . Why , I told him everything ! Too much , may be , for I showed him all my passions and ill - tempers ! Married so long ! Oh , Osborne , Osborne , you should have told me ! "
282187	282193	282195	282196	Mr. Gibson	238	" Yes , he should ! "
282198	282224	282195	282196	Mr. Gibson	238	" But I daresay he knew how much you would dislike such a choice as he had made . But he should have told you ! "
282225	282234	282236	282237	the Squire	1206	" You know nothing about it , sir , "
282240	282314	282236	282237	the Squire	1206	" You do n't know the terms we were on . Not hearty or confidential . I was cross to him many a time ; angry with him for being dull , poor lad and he with all this weight on his mind . I wo n't have people interfering and judging between me and my sons . And Roger too ! He could know it all , and keep it from me ! "
282315	282331	282333	282333	Molly	147	" Osborne evidently had bound him down to secrecy , just as he bound me , "
282335	282342	282333	282333	Molly	147	" Roger could not help himself . "
282343	282358	282360	282361	the Squire	1206	" Osborne was such a fellow for persuading people , and winning them over , "
282365	282411	282360	282361	the Squire	1206	" I remember but what 's the use of remembering ? It 's all over , and Osborne 's dead without opening his heart to me . I could have been tender to him , I could . But he 'll never know it now ! "
282412	282438	282440	282441	Mr. Gibson	238	" But we can guess what wish he had strongest in his mind at the last , from what we do know of his life , "
282443	282448	282450	282451	the Squire	1206	" What , sir ? "
282461	282475	282333	282333	Molly	147	" His wife must have been his last thought , must she not ? "
282476	282510	282333	282333	Molly	147	" How do I know she was his wife ? Do you think he 'd go and marry a French baggage of a servant ? It may be all a tale trumped up . "
282511	282566	282333	282333	Molly	147	" Stop , Squire . I do n't care to defend my daughter 's truth or accuracy . But with the dead man 's body lying upstairs his soul with God think twice before you say more hasty words , impugning his character ; if she was not his wife , what was she ? "
282567	282622	282628	282628	his	5828	" I beg your pardon . I hardly know what I 'm saying . Did I accuse Osborne ? Oh , my lad , my lad thou might have trusted thy old dad ! He used to call me his ' old dad ' when he was a little chap not bigger than this , "
282631	282666	282628	282628	his	5828	" I never meant to say he was not not what one would wish to think him now his soul with God , as you say very justly for I 'm sure it is there "
282667	282674	282676	282677	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well ! but , Squire , "
282687	282693	282676	282677	Mr. Gibson	238	" to return to his wife "
282694	282699	282701	282701	Molly	147	" And the child , "
282720	282723	282725	282725	he	675	" What ? "
282733	282768	282725	282725	he	675	" child ? You never named that ? Is there a child ? Husband and father , and I never knew ! God bless Osborne 's child ! I say , God bless it ! "
282806	282830	282801	282801	his	675	" You 're a good girl . Thank you . Tell me what I ought to do , and I 'll do it . "
282836	282849	282851	282851	he	675	" I 'm almost as much puzzled as you are , Squire , "
282853	282925	282851	282851	he	675	" I fully believe the whole story ; but I think there must be some written confirmation of it , which perhaps ought to be found at once , before we act . Most probably this is to be discovered among Osborne 's papers . Will you look over them at once ? Molly shall return with me , and find the address that Osborne gave her , while you are busy "
282926	282933	282935	282936	the Squire	1206	" She 'll come back again ? "
282939	282949	282935	282936	the Squire	1206	" You she wo n't leave me to myself ? "
282950	282991	282851	282851	he	675	" No ! She shall come back this evening . I 'll manage to send her somehow . But she has no clothes but the habit she came in , and I want my horse that she rode away upon . "
282992	282997	282999	283000	the Squire	1206	" Take the carriage , "
283002	283019	282999	283000	the Squire	1206	" Take anything . I 'll give orders . You 'll come back again , too ? "
283020	283056	282851	282851	he	675	" No ! I 'm afraid not , to - day . I 'll come to - morrow , early . Molly shall return this evening , whenever it suits you to send for her . "
283057	283099	282999	283000	the Squire	1206	" This afternoon ; the carriage shall be at your house at three . I dare not look at Osborne 's at the papers without one of you with me ; and yet I shall never rest till I know more . "
283100	283124	282851	282851	he	675	" I 'll send the desk in by Robinson before I leave . And can you give me some lunch before I go ? "
283249	283290	283231	283231	he	5838	" Give my love to Miss Kirkpatrick ; tell her I look upon her as quite one of the family . I shall be glad to see her after after the funeral . I do n't think I can before . "
283291	283304	283306	283307	Mr. Gibson	238	" He knows nothing of Cynthia 's resolution to give up Roger , "
283313	283387	283306	283307	Mr. Gibson	238	" I had a long talk with her last night , but she was as resolute as ever . From what your mamma tells me , there is a third lover in London , whom she 's already refused . I 'm thankful that you 've no lover at all , Molly , unless that abortive attempt of Mr. Coxe 's at an offer , long ago , can be called a lover . "
283388	283397	283399	283399	Molly	147	" I never heard of it , papa ! "
283401	283462	283306	283307	Mr. Gibson	238	" Oh , no ; I forgot . What a fool I was ! Why , do n't you remember the hurry I was in to get you off to Hamley Hall , the very first time you ever went ? It was all because I got hold of a desperate love - letter from Coxe , addressed to you . "
283534	283544	283546	283546	he	675	" Some one must write to Mrs. Osborne Hamley , "
283548	283587	283546	283546	he	675	" I believe her to have a legal right to the name ; but whether or no , she must be told that the father of her child is dead . Shall you do it , or I ? "
283588	283597	283529	283529	He	675	" Oh , you , please , papa ! "
283598	283640	283546	283546	he	675	" I will , if you wish . But she may have heard of you as a friend of her dead husband 's ; while of me a mere country doctor it 's very probable she has never heard the name . "
283641	283651	283529	283529	He	675	" If I ought , I will do it . "
283669	283677	283679	283679	she	5843	" There 's Hollingford church - spire , "
283700	283715	283679	283679	she	5843	" I think I never wish to go out of sight of it again . "
283716	283719	283721	283721	he	238	" Nonsense ! "
283723	283834	283721	283721	he	238	" Why , you 've all your travelling to do yet ; and if these new - fangled railways spread , as they say they will , we shall all be spinning about the world ; ' sitting on tea - kettles , ' as Phobe Browning calls it . Miss Browning wrote such a capital letter of advice to Miss Hornblower . I heard of it at the Millers ' . Miss Hornblower was going to travel by railroad for the first time ; and Dorothy was very anxious , and sent her directions for her conduct ; one piece of advice was not to sit on the boiler . "
283847	283857	283841	283841	she	147	" Here we are at home , at last . "
283912	283961	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" To think of it all being so sudden at last ! Not but what I always expected it ! And so provoking ! Just when Cynthia had given up Roger ! If she had only waited a day ! What does the Squire say to it all ? "
283962	283970	283972	283972	Molly	147	" He is beaten down with grief , "
283974	283990	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Indeed ! I should not have fancied he had liked the engagement so much . "
283991	283995	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What engagement ? "
283996	284024	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Why , Roger to Cynthia , to be sure . I asked you how the Squire took her letter , announcing the breaking of it off ? "
284025	284049	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh I made a mistake . He has n't opened his letters to - day . I saw Cynthia 's among them . "
284050	284058	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Now that I call positive disrespect . "
284059	284077	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't know . He did not mean it for such . Where is Cynthia ? "
284078	284188	283890	283891	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Gone out into the meadow - garden . She 'll be in directly . I wanted her to do some errands for me , but she flatly refused to go into the town . I am afraid she mismanages her affairs badly . But she wo n't allow me to interfere . I hate to look at such things in a mercenary spirit , but it is provoking to see her throw over two such good matches . First Mr. Henderson , and now Roger Hamley . When does the Squire expect Roger ? Does he think he will come back sooner for poor dear Osborne 's death ? "
284189	284237	284238	284238	Molly	147	" I do n't know . He hardly seems to think of anything but Osborne . He appears to me to have almost forgotten every one else . But perhaps the news of Osborne 's being married , and of the child , may rouse him up . "
284322	284339	284317	284319	So Mrs. Gibson	189	" What do you mean , child ? Married ! Osborne married ! Who says so ? "
284340	284399	284281	284282	Mr. Gibson	238	" Oh , dear ! I suppose I ought not to have named it . I 'm very stupid to - day . Yes ! Osborne has been married a long time ; but the Squire did not know of it until this morning . I think it has done him good . But I do n't know . "
284400	284460	284317	284319	So Mrs. Gibson	189	" Who is the lady ? Why , I call it a shame to go about as a single man , and be married all the time ! If there is one thing that revolts me , it is duplicity . Who is the lady ? Do tell me all you know about it , there 's a dear . "
284461	284471	284473	284473	Molly	147	" She is French , and a Roman Catholic , "
284475	284506	284317	284319	So Mrs. Gibson	189	" French ! They are such beguiling women ; and he was so much abroad ! You said there was a child , is it a boy or a girl ? "
284507	284518	284317	284319	So Mrs. Gibson	189	" I did not hear . I did not ask . "
284602	284644	284596	284596	she	252	" Molly , darling ! Is that you ? You 're as welcome as the flowers in May , though you 've not been gone twenty - four hours . But the house is n't the same when you are away ! "
284645	284654	284656	284657	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And she brings us such news too ! "
284659	284726	284656	284657	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 'm really almost glad you wrote to the Squire yesterday , for if you had waited till to - day I thought you were in too great a hurry at the time he might have thought you had some interested reason for giving up your engagement . Osborne Hamley was married all this time unknown to everybody , and has got a child too . "
284727	284731	284733	284733	Cynthia	252	" Osborne married ! "
284735	284763	284733	284733	Cynthia	252	" If ever a man looked a bachelor , he did . Poor Osborne ! with his fair delicate elegance , he looked so young and boyish ! "
284764	284837	284596	284596	she	252	" Yes ! it was a great piece of deceit , and I ca n't easily forgive him for it . Only think ! If he had paid either of you any particular attention , and you had fallen in love with him ! Why , he might have broken your heart , or Molly 's either . I ca n't forgive him , even though he is dead , poor fellow ! "
284838	284883	284884	284884	Cynthia	252	" Well , as he never did pay either of us any particular attention , and as we neither of us did fall in love with him , I think I only feel sorry that he had all the trouble and worry of concealment . "
284903	284981	284884	284884	Cynthia	252	" And now of course it is a son , and will be the heir , and Roger will just be as poorly off as ever . I hope you 'll take care and let the Squire know Cynthia was quite ignorant of these new facts that have come out when she wrote those letters , Molly ? I should not like a suspicion of worldliness to rest upon any one with whom I had any concern . "
284982	285002	285004	285004	Molly	147	" He has n't read Cynthia 's letter yet . Oh , do let me bring it home unopened , "
285006	285070	285004	285004	Molly	147	" Send another letter to Roger now at once ; it will reach him at the same time ; he will get both when he arrives at the Cape , and make him understand which is the last the real one . Think ! he will hear of Osborne 's death at the same time two such sad things ! Do , Cynthia ! "
285071	285077	285079	285080	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No , my dear , "
285082	285127	285079	285080	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I could not allow that , even if Cynthia felt inclined for it . Asking to be re - engaged to him ! At any rate , she must wait now until he proposes again , and we see how things turn out . "
285138	285141	285143	285143	Cynthia	252	" No ! "
285151	285304	285143	285143	Cynthia	252	" It can not be . I 've felt more content this last night than I 've done for weeks past . I 'm glad to be free . I dreaded Roger 's goodness , and learning , and all that . It was not in my way , and I do n't believe I should have ever married him , even without knowing of all these ill - natured stories that are circulating about me , and which he would hear of , and expect me to explain , and be sorry for , and penitent and humble . I know he could not have made me happy , and I do n't believe he would have been happy with me . It must stay as it is . I would rather be a governess than married to him . I should get weary of him every day of my life . "
285305	285310	285312	285312	Molly	147	" Weary of Roger ! "
285316	285327	285328	285328	she	147	" It is best as it is , I see , "
285332	285361	285328	285328	she	147	" Only I 'm very sorry for him , very . He did love you so . You will never get any one to love you like him ! "
285362	285403	285143	285143	Cynthia	252	" Very well . I must take my chance . And too much love is rather oppressive to me , I believe . I like a great deal , widely spread about ; not all confined to one individual lover . "
285404	285411	285413	285413	Molly	147	" I do n't believe you , "
285415	285455	285413	285413	Molly	147	" But do n't let us talk any more about it . It is best as it is . I thought I almost felt sure you would be sorry this morning . But we will leave it alone now . "
285507	285516	285517	285517	she	252	" You are vexed with me , Molly , "
285530	285586	285525	285525	Molly	147	" I ! I have no business at all in the affair . It is for you to judge . Do what you think right . I believe you have done right . Only I do n't want to discuss it , and paw it over with talk . I 'm very much tired , dear "
285591	285610	285589	285589	she	252	" and I hardly know what I say . If I speak crossly , do n't mind it . "
285622	285676	285619	285619	she	252	" Do you think I might go with you , and help you ? I might have done yesterday ; and you say he has n't opened my letter , so he has not heard as yet . And I was always fond of poor Osborne , in my way , you know . "
285677	285690	285692	285692	Molly	147	" I can not tell ; I have no right to say , "
285712	285752	285619	285619	she	252	" Papa would be able to judge ; I think , perhaps , you had better not . But do n't go by my opinion ; I can only tell what I should wish to do in your place . "
285753	285768	285770	285770	Cynthia	252	" It was as much for your sake as any one 's , Molly , "
285772	285824	285619	285619	she	252	" Oh , then , do n't ! I am tired to - day with sitting up ; but to - morrow I shall be all right ; and I should not like it , if , for my sake , you came into the house at so solemn a time . "
285825	285829	285831	285831	Cynthia	252	" Very well ! "
285853	285862	285846	285846	she	252	" It would have been awkward after all . "
286063	286069	286070	286070	he	1206	" It 's all true , "
286153	286226	286151	286151	dear	6749	" He sate down in the nearest chair and groaned . Molly took a seat by him , and read the legal paper , the perusal of which was not needed to convince her of the fact of the marriage . She held it in her hand after she had finished reading it , waiting for the Squire 's next coherent words ; for he kept talking to himself in broken sentences . "
286336	286355	286392	286392	her	0	" He covered his face , and moved himself backward and forward till Molly could bear it no longer .
286356	286362	286364	286364	she	0	" There are some letters , "
286366	286374	286364	286364	she	0	" may I read any of them ? "
286403	286412	286414	286414	he	2701	" Ay , read 'em , read 'em , "
286416	286450	286414	286414	he	2701	" Maybe you can . I can only pick out a word here and there . I put 'em there for you to look at ; and tell me what is in 'em . "
286531	286534	286493	286493	she	0	" little language "
286600	286604	286597	286597	he	2701	" Go on . "
286645	286657	286694	286694	his	1206	" Have you seen this , sir ? This certificate of baptism "
286660	286683	286694	286694	his	1206	" of Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley , born June 21 , 183 , child of Osborne Hamley and Marie - Aimťe his wife "
286684	286689	286691	286692	the Squire	1206	" Give it me , "
286706	286942	286943	286943	he	5880	" ' Roger , ' that 's me , ' Stephen , ' that 's my poor old father : he died when he was not so old as I am ; but I 've always thought on him as very old . He was main and fond of Osborne , when he was quite a little one . It 's good of the lad to have thought on my father Stephen . Ay ! that was his name . And Osborne Osborne Hamley ! One Osborne Hamley lies dead on his bed and t'other t'other I 've never seen , and never heard on till to - day . He must be called Osborne , Molly . There is a Roger there 's two for that matter ; but one is a good - for - nothing old man ; and there 's never an Osborne any more , unless this little thing is called Osborne ; we 'll have him here , and get a nurse for him ; and make his mother comfortable for life in her own country . I 'll keep this , Molly . You 're a good lass for finding it . Osborne Hamley ! And if God will give me grace , he shall never hear a cross word from me never ! He sha n't be afeard of me . Oh , my Osborne , my Osborne "
286947	286983	286943	286943	he	5880	" do you know now how bitter and sore is my heart for every hard word as I ever spoke to you ? Do you know now how I loved you my boy my boy ? "
287285	287291	287293	287294	Mr. Gibson	238	" She must be told , "
287298	287304	287306	287307	his daughter	1390	" Yes , she must , "
287309	287313	287306	287307	his daughter	1390	" But how ? "
287314	287326	287328	287328	he	238	" A day or two of waiting will do no harm , "
287344	287379	287328	287328	he	238	" It will make her anxious , poor thing , and all sorts of gloomy possibilities will suggest themselves to her mind amongst them the truth ; it will be a kind of preparation . "
287380	287391	287393	287393	Molly	147	" For what ? Something must be done at last , "
287395	287502	287328	287328	he	238	" Yes ; true . Suppose you write , and say he 's very ill ; write to - morrow . I daresay they 've indulged themselves in daily postage , and then she 'll have had three days ' silence . You say how you come to know all you do about it ; I think she ought to know he is very ill in great danger , if you like : and you can follow it up next day with the full truth . I would n't worry the Squire about it . After the funeral we will have a talk about the child . "
287503	287511	287513	287513	Molly	147	" She will never part with it , "
287515	287528	287530	287531	her father	675	" Whew ! Till I see the woman I ca n't tell , "
287582	287582	287548	287548	you	147	"
287583	287617	287548	287548	you	147	" So you always say , papa . But in this case I think you 'll find I 'm right . I judge from her letters ; but I think I 'm right . "
287618	287811	287548	287548	you	147	" So you always say , daughter . Time will show . So the child is a boy ? Mrs. Gibson told me particularly to ask . It will go far to reconciling her to Cynthia 's dismissal of Roger . But indeed it is quite as well for both of them , though of course he will be a long time before he thinks so . They were not suited to each other . Poor Roger ! It was hard work writing to him yesterday ; and who knows what may have become of him ! Well , well ! one has to get through the world somehow . I 'm glad , however , this little lad has turned up to be the heir . I should n't have liked the property to go to the Irish Hamleys , who are the next heirs , as Osborne once told me . Now write that letter , Molly , to the poor little Frenchwoman out yonder . It will prepare her for it ; and we must think a bit how to spare her the shock , for Osborne 's sake . "
287987	287991	287993	287993	he	1206	" the Frenchwoman , "
288439	288445	288446	288446	she	8199	" He was such company , "
288449	288473	288446	288446	she	8199	" and he would so tire his mother in her journeyings ; and maybe his father would be too ill to see him . "
288479	288500	288476	288476	Aimťe	482	" Good company for you , but better for me . A woman is never tired with carrying her own child "
288523	288544	288545	288546	So Aimťe	482	" and if Monsieur could care for anything , he would rejoice to hear the babble of his little son . "

288690	288712	288894	288895	the innkeeper	5949	" for the boy ; and they went off again into the wide world , only thinking of , only seeking the "
288715	288887	288670	288671	Madame Pauline	486	" who was everything human to both . Aimťe remembered the sound of the name of the village where Osborne had often told her that he alighted from the coach to walk home ; and though she could never have spelt the strange uncouth word , yet she spoke it with pretty slow distinctness to the guard , asking him in her broken English when they should arrive there ? Not till four o'clock . Alas ! and what might happen before then ! Once with him she would have no fear ; she was sure that she could bring him round ; but what might not happen before he was in her tender care ? She was a very capable person in many ways , though so childish and innocent in others . She made up her mind to the course she should pursue when the coach set her down at Feversham . She asked for a man to carry her trunk , and show her the way to Hamley Hall .
288888	288892	288894	288895	the innkeeper	5949	" Hamley Hall ! "
288897	288911	288894	288895	the innkeeper	5949	" Eh ! there 's a deal o ' trouble there just now . "
288912	288919	288921	288921	she	5949	" I know , I know , "
289000	289008	289010	289014	the boots from the inn	5953	" Back door or front , missus ? "
289016	289021	289023	289023	she	5949	" The most nearest , "
289030	289035	289036	289036	Molly	482	" the most nearest . "
289315	289336	289305	289305	She	5970	" Can I see Mr. Osborne Hamley ? He is ill , I know ; but I am his wife . "
289427	289436	289414	289414	he	324	" Wait awhile , I 'll come back , "
289476	289485	289487	289488	the Squire	1206	" What is it ? What is it ? "
289494	289508	289487	289488	the Squire	1206	" Do n't keep it from me . I can bear it . Roger "
289535	289542	289544	289544	Molly	482	" Mrs. Osborne Hamley is here , "
289546	289563	289544	289544	Molly	482	" I wrote to tell her her husband was very ill , and she has come . "

289602	289617	289593	289594	the Squire	1206	" You will go , Molly , wo n't you ? You 'll go . "
289643	289669	289637	289637	Robinson	324	" She looks but a weakly thing , and has carried a big baby , choose how far , I did n't stop to ask . "

290723	290744	290702	290703	the Squire	1206	" I do n't know . I do n't know what Frenchwomen are like . People say Cynthia is French . "
290745	290911	290702	290703	the Squire	1206	" And she did n't look like a servant ? We wo n't speak of Cynthia since she 's served my Roger so . Why , I began to think , as soon as I could think after that , how I would make Roger and her happy , and have them married at once ; and then came that letter ! I never wanted her for a daughter - in - law , not I. But he did , it seems ; and he was n't one for wanting many things for himself . But it 's all over now ; only we wo n't talk of her ; and maybe , as you say , she was more French than English . This poor thing looks like a gentlewoman , I think . I hope she 's got friends who 'll take care of her , she ca n't be above twenty . I thought she must be older than my poor lad ! "
290912	290921	290923	290923	Molly	482	" She 's a gentle , pretty creature , "
290925	290942	290923	290923	Molly	482	" But but I sometimes think it has killed her ; she lies like one dead . "
290955	290960	290962	290963	the Squire	1206	" Nay , nay ! "
290965	291030	290962	290963	the Squire	1206	" It 's not so easy to break one 's heart . Sometimes I 've wished it were . But one has to go on living ' all the appointed days , ' as it says in the Bible . But we 'll do our best for her . We 'll not think of letting her go away till she 's fit to travel . "
291240	291248	291230	291230	He	1206	" How pleased she would have been ! "
291264	291312	291261	291261	her	482	" at the first moment . Presently , but it seemed a long long time first , she heard the quick prompt sounds which told of her father 's arrival . In he came to the room as yet only lighted by the fitful blaze of the fire .
291440	291450	291452	291453	Mr. Gibson	238	" Well ! this is a fine young gentleman , "
291466	291510	291511	291511	He	238	" And you 've got the mother here , I understand . Mrs. Osborne Hamley , as we must call her , poor thing ! It 's a sad coming home to her ; for I hear she knew nothing of his death . "
291536	291660	291532	291533	The Squire	1206	" Yes ! She 's felt it a terrible shock . She 's upstairs in the best bedroom . I should like you to see her , Gibson , if she 'll let you . We must do our duty by her , for my poor lad 's sake . I wish he could have seen his boy lying there ; I do . I daresay it preyed on him to have to keep it all to himself . He might ha ' known me , though . He might ha ' known my bark was waur than my bite . It 's all over now , though ; and God forgive me if I was too sharp . I 'm punished now . "
291670	291697	291661	291661	Molly	147	" Papa , I feel as if she was very ill ; perhaps worse than we think . Will you go and see her at once ? "
291796	291811	291812	291812	he	238	" Bring me some wine at once , and order some beef - tea , "
292040	292042	292026	292027	Mr. Gibson	238	" maman "
292465	292607	292462	292462	he	238	" Now , Molly , look how much less trouble the dear old Squire would give if he would obey orders . He is only adding to anxiety by indulging himself . One pardons everything to extreme grief , however . But you will have enough to do to occupy all your strength for days to come ; and go to bed you must now . I only wish I saw my way as clearly through other things as I do to your nearest duty . I wish I 'd never let Roger go wandering off ; he 'll wish it too , poor fellow ! Did I tell you Cynthia is going off in hot haste to her uncle Kirkpatrick 's ? I suspect a visit to him will stand in lieu of going out to Russia as a governess . "
292608	292621	292462	292462	he	238	" I am sure she was quite serious in wishing for that . "
292622	292690	292462	292462	he	238	" Yes , yes ! at the time . I 've no doubt she thought she was sincere in intending to go . But the great thing was to get out of the unpleasantness of the present time and place ; and uncle Kirkpatrick 's will do this as effectually , and more pleasantly , than a situation at Nishni - Novgorod in an ice - palace . "
293137	293156	293132	293133	Mr. Gibson	238	" Wait quietly . Time enough when nature and circumstance have had their chance , and have failed . "
293317	293322	293313	293315	Mrs. Osborne Hamley	205	" taken the turn , "
293405	293411	293413	293414	Mr. Gibson	238	" Do n't go on , "
293427	293449	293413	293414	Mr. Gibson	238	" Lie down here with your back to the light . I 'll come back and see you before I go . "
293515	293627	293690	293690	he	238	" Well , Gibson , and how goes the patient ? Better ? I wish we could get her out of doors , such a fine day as it is . It would make her strong as soon as anything . I used to beg my poor lad to come out more . Maybe , I worried him ; but the air is the finest thing for strengthening that I know of . Though , perhaps , she 'll not thrive in English air as if she 'd been born here ; and she 'll not be quite right till she gets back to her native place , wherever that is . "
293628	293676	293677	293678	Mr. Gibson	238	" I do n't know . I begin to think we shall get her quite round here ; and I do n't know that she could be in a better place . But it 's not about her . May I order the carriage for my Molly ? "
293696	293701	293703	293704	the Squire	1206	" To be sure , "
293739	293743	293745	293745	he	1206	" I say , "
293755	293775	293745	293745	he	1206	" what 's the matter , man ? Do n't twitch up your face like that , but speak ! "
293776	293782	293784	293785	Mr. Gibson	238	" Nothing 's the matter , "
293789	293802	293804	293804	he	238	" Only I want her at home , under my own eye ; "
293850	293856	293857	293857	he	1206	" I say , Gibson , "
293863	293903	293857	293857	he	1206	" your Molly is liker a child of mine than a stranger ; and I reckon we 've all on us been coming too hard upon her . You do n't think there 's much amiss , do you ? "
293904	293910	293912	293913	Mr. Gibson	238	" How can I tell ? "
294218	294229	294231	294231	she	189	" without either of her two dear girls at home , "
294243	294343	294231	294231	she	189	" Why , my sweet Molly , this is an unexpected pleasure . Only this morning I said to papa , ' When do you think we shall see our Molly back ? ' He did not say much he never does , you know ; but I am sure he thought directly of giving me this surprise , this pleasure . You 're looking a little what shall I call it ? I remember such a pretty line of poetry , ' Oh , call her fair , not pale ! ' so we 'll call you fair . "
294344	294394	294395	294395	He	6120	" You 'd better not call her anything , but let her get to her own room and have a good rest as soon as possible . Have n't you got a trashy novel or two in the house ? That 's the literature to send her to sleep . "
294458	294463	294465	294465	he	6120	" Now , Hyacinth , "
294530	294530	294512	294512	I	0	"
294531	294667	294512	294512	I	0	" Poor thing ! she does look worn out . She is something like me , her feelings are too much for her . But now she is come home she shall find us as cheerful as possible . I can answer for myself ; and you really must brighten up your doleful face , my dear nothing so bad for invalids as the appearance of depression in those around them . I have had such a pleasant letter from Cynthia to - day . Uncle Kirkpatrick really seems to make so much of her , he treats her just like a daughter ; he has given her a ticket to the Concerts of Ancient Music ; and Mr. Henderson has been to call on her , in spite of all that has gone before . "
294778	294778	294782	294782	he	238	"
294859	294867	294847	294848	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly was feeling the spring weather ; "
294869	294888	294908	294908	herself	189	" Molly had been a good deal overdone with her stay at the Hall , and was resting ; "
295034	295144	295031	295031	she	168	" Really , Clare , I spend so much time in your house that I 'm going to establish a work - basket here . Mary has infected me with her notability , and I 'm going to work mamma a footstool . It is to be a surprise ; and so if I do it here she will know nothing about it . Only I can not match the gold beads I want for the pansies in this dear little town ; and Hollingford , who could send me down stars and planets if I asked him , I make no doubt , could no more match beads than "
295145	295170	295031	295031	she	168	" My dear Lady Harriet ! you forget Cynthia ! Think what a pleasure it would be to her to do anything for you . "
295171	295241	295031	295031	she	168	" Would it ? Then she shall have plenty of it ; but mind , it is you who have answered for her . She shall get me some wool too ; how good I am to confer so much pleasure on a fellow - creature ! But seriously , do you think I might write and give her a few commissions ? Neither Agnes nor Mary are in town "
295242	295251	295253	295254	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I am sure she would be delighted , "
295331	295393	295326	295326	she	252	" I saw Molly this morning . Twice I have been forbidden admittance , as she was too ill to see any one out of her own family . I wish we could begin to perceive a change for the better ; but she looks more fading every time , and I fear Mr. Gibson considers it a very anxious case . "
295484	295539	295476	295476	She	189	" Cynthia ! Dear child , where have you come from ? Why in the world have you come ? My poor nerves ! My heart is quite fluttering ; but , to be sure , it 's no wonder with all this anxiety I have to undergo . Why have you come back ? "
295540	295564	295476	295476	She	189	" Because of the anxiety you speak of , mamma . I never knew , you never told me how ill Molly was . "
295565	295630	295476	295476	She	189	" Nonsense ! I beg your pardon , my dear , but it 's really nonsense . Molly 's illness is only nervous , Mr. Gibson says . A nervous fever ; but you must remember nerves are mere fancy , and she 's getting better . Such a pity for you to have left your uncle 's . Who told you about Molly ? "
295631	295640	295476	295476	She	189	" Lady Harriet . She wrote about some wool "
295641	295730	295476	295476	She	189	" I know , I know . But you might have known she always exaggerates things . Not but what I have been almost worn out with nursing . Perhaps , after all , it is a very good thing you have come , my dear ; and now you shall come down into the dining - room and have some lunch , and tell me all the Hyde Park Street news into my room , do n't go into yours yet Molly is so sensitive to noise ! "
295743	295783	295737	295738	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And your aunt , how is her cold ? And Helen , quite strong again ? Margaretta as pretty as ever ? The boys are at Harrow , I suppose ? And my old favourite , Mr. Henderson ? "
295834	295886	295820	295820	she	252	" My aunt is quite well ; Helen is as strong as she ever is , and Margaretta very pretty . The boys are at Harrow , and I conclude that Mr. Henderson is enjoying his usual health , for he was to dine at my uncle 's to - day . "
295887	295902	295904	295905	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Take care , Cynthia . Look how you are cutting that gooseberry tart , "
295930	295968	295904	295905	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I ca n't think how you could come off in this sudden kind of way ; I am sure it must have annoyed your uncle and aunt . I daresay they 'll never ask you again . "
295969	295992	295820	295820	she	252	" On the contrary , I am to go back there as soon as ever I can be easy to leave Molly . "
295993	296058	295904	295905	Mrs. Gibson	189	" ' Easy to leave Molly . ' Now that really is nonsense , and rather uncomplimentary to me , I must say : nursing her as I have been doing , daily , and almost nightly ; for I have been wakened times out of number by Mr. Gibson getting up , and going to see if she had had her medicine properly . "
296059	296069	296071	296071	Cynthia	252	" I 'm afraid she has been very ill ? "
296073	296121	295904	295905	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes , she has , in one way ; but not in another . It was what I call more a tedious , than an interesting illness . There was no immediate danger , but she lay much in the same state from day to day . "
296122	296129	296131	296131	Cynthia	252	" I wish I had known ! "
296133	296145	296131	296131	Cynthia	252	" Do you think I might go and see her now ? "
296146	296174	296175	296175	He	6141	" I 'll go and prepare her . You 'll find her a good deal better than she has been . Ah ; here 's Mr. Gibson ! "
296194	296198	296200	296200	he	6141	" You here ! "
296208	296216	296200	296200	he	6141	" Why , how did you come ? "
296217	296240	296241	296241	Her	252	" By the ' Umpire . ' I never knew Molly had been so ill , or I would have come directly . "
296262	296271	296253	296253	he	6141	" You 're a good girl , Cynthia . "
296272	296285	296287	296288	Mrs. Gibson	189	" She 's heard one of dear Lady Harriet 's exaggerated accounts , "
296290	296313	296287	296288	Mrs. Gibson	189	" and come straight off . I tell her it 's very foolish , for Molly is a great deal better now . "
296314	296318	296320	296321	Mr. Gibson	238	" Very foolish , "
296334	296353	296320	296321	Mr. Gibson	238	" But sometimes one likes foolish people for their folly , better than wise people for their wisdom . "
296354	296363	296365	296366	his wife	995	" I am afraid folly always annoys me , "
296368	296383	296365	296366	his wife	995	" However , Cynthia is here , and what is done , is done . "
296384	296421	296424	296424	Cynthia	252	" Very true , my dear . And now I 'll run up and see my little girl , and tell her the good news . You 'd better follow me in a couple of minutes . "
296458	296465	296455	296455	she	147	" It is such a pleasure , "
296636	296654	296622	296622	she	252	" You told me all that before , my dear . Let us talk of something else ; "
296657	296714	296628	296629	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Really I can not allow you to be always dwelling on painful thoughts . Try and be a little more cheerful . Youth is gay . You are young , and therefore you ought to be gay . That is put in a famous form of speech ; I forget exactly what it is called . "
296875	296879	296872	296877	humble patients of " the doctor	11935	" the doctor , "
296900	296905	296872	296877	humble patients of " the doctor	11935	" their duty for Miss. "
297228	297337	297221	297221	she	147	" Ah ! these white pinks ! They were Mrs. Hamley 's favourite flower ; and so like her ! This little bit of sweet briar , it quite scents the room . It has pricked my fingers , but never mind . Oh , mamma , look at this rose ! I forget its name , but it is very rare , and grows up in the sheltered corner of the wall , near the mulberry - tree . Roger bought the tree for his mother with his own money when he was quite a boy ; he showed it me , and made me notice it . "
297338	297359	297221	297221	she	147	" I daresay it was Roger who got it now . You heard papa say he had seen him yesterday . "
297360	297369	297371	297371	Molly	147	" No ! Roger ! Roger come home ! "
297381	297422	297221	297221	she	147	" Yes . Oh , I remember you had gone to bed before papa came in , and he was called off early to tiresome Mrs. Beale . Yes , Roger turned up at the Hall the day before yesterday . "
297454	297459	297443	297443	She	147	" Roger come home ! "
297796	297799	297801	297801	she	147	" Well ! "
297809	297814	297816	297816	he	675	" Well ! what ? "
297820	297849	297772	297772	She	147	" Oh ! why , such a number of things . I 've been waiting all day to ask you all about everything . How is he looking ? "
297850	297892	297804	297804	her	147	" If a young man of twenty - four ever does take to growing taller , I should say that he was taller . As it is , I suppose it 's only that he looks broader , stronger more muscular . "
297893	297900	297902	297902	Molly	147	" Oh ! is he changed ? "
297911	297957	297804	297804	her	147	" No , not changed ; and yet not the same . He 's as brown as a berry for one thing ; caught a little of the negro tinge , and a beard as fine and sweeping as my bay - mare 's tail . "
297958	297986	297804	297804	her	147	" A beard ! But go on , papa . Does he talk as he used to do ? I should know his voice amongst ten thousand . "
297987	298037	297804	297804	her	147	" I did n't catch any Hottentot twang , if that 's what you mean . Nor did he say , ' Casar and Pompey berry much alike , ' specially Pompey , ' which is the only specimen of negro language I can remember just at this moment . "
298038	298049	298051	298052	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And which I never could see the wit of , "
298132	298144	298150	298150	she	147	" Tell me , how are they all getting on together ? "
298191	298194	298196	298197	Mr. Gibson	238	" Oh ! "
298199	298214	298196	298197	Mr. Gibson	238	" Roger is evidently putting everything to rights in his firm , quiet way . "
298215	298228	298230	298231	Mrs. Gibson	189	" ' Things to rights . ' Why , what 's wrong ? "
298234	298301	298230	298231	Mrs. Gibson	189	" The Squire and the French daughter - in - law do n't get on well together , I suppose ? I am always so glad Cynthia acted with the promptitude she did ; it would have been very awkward for her to have been mixed up with all these complications . Poor Roger ! to find himself supplanted by a child when he comes home ! "
298302	298365	298196	298197	Mr. Gibson	238	" You were not in the room , my dear , when I was telling Molly of the reasons for Roger 's return ; it was to put his brother 's child at once into his rightful and legal place . So now , when he finds the work partly done to his hands , he is happy and gratified in proportion . "
298366	298381	298382	298383	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Then he is not much affected by Cynthia 's breaking off her engagement ? "
298390	298392	298382	298383	Mrs. Gibson	189	" engagement "
298395	298407	298382	298383	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I never did give him credit for very deep feelings . "
298408	298431	298382	298383	Mrs. Gibson	189	" On the contrary , he feels it very acutely . He and I had a long talk about it , yesterday . "
298522	298532	298512	298512	Molly	147	" And Mrs. Osborne Hamley ? How is she ? "
298533	298678	298516	298516	her	147	" Wonderfully brightened up by Roger 's presence . I do n't think I 've ever seen her smile before ; but she gives him the sweetest smiles from time to time . They are evidently good friends ; and she loses her strange startled look when she speaks to him . I suspect she has been quite aware of the Squire 's wish that she should return to France ; and has been hard put to it to decide whether to leave her child or not . The idea that she would have to make some such decision came upon her when she was completely shattered by grief and illness , and she has n't had any one to consult as to her duty until Roger came , upon whom she has evidently firm reliance . He told me something of this himself . "
298679	298694	298512	298512	Molly	147	" You seem to have had quite a long conversation with him , papa ! "
298695	298772	298516	298516	her	147	" Yes . I was going to see old Abraham , when the Squire called to me over the hedge , as I was jogging along . He told me the news ; and there was no resisting his invitation to come back and lunch with them . Besides , one gets a great deal of meaning out of Roger 's words ; it did n't take so very long a time to hear this much . "
298773	298786	298788	298789	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I should think he would come and call upon us soon , "
298793	298807	298788	298789	Mrs. Gibson	189	" and then we shall see how much we can manage to hear . "
298808	298817	298819	298819	Molly	147	" Do you think he will , papa ? "
298867	298929	298849	298849	she	189	" I ca n't tell , my dear . Until he 's quite convinced of Cynthia 's intentions , it ca n't be very pleasant for him to come on mere visits of ceremony to the house in which he has known her ; but he 's one who will always do what he thinks right , whether pleasant or not . "
298951	298977	298930	298931	Mrs. Gibson	189	" ' Convinced of Cynthia 's intentions ! ' I should think she had made them pretty clear ! What more does the man want ? "
298978	299066	299101	299102	Mr. Gibson	238	" He 's not as yet convinced that the letter was n't written in a fit of temporary feeling . I 've told him that this was true ; although I did n't feel it my place to explain to him the causes of that feeling . He believes that he can induce her to resume the former footing . I do n't ; and I 've told him so ; but , of course , he needs the full conviction that she alone can give him . "
299067	299075	299077	299078	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Poor Cynthia ! My poor child ! "
299082	299100	299077	299078	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What she has exposed herself to by letting herself be over - persuaded by that man ! "
299120	299128	299109	299109	he	238	" ' That man , ' indeed ! "
299152	299158	299134	299134	Molly	147	" Mere visits of ceremony ! "
299166	299172	299134	299134	Molly	147	" mere visit of ceremony ! "
299507	299526	299488	299488	he	6194	" I was so sorry to hear how ill you had been ! You are looking but delicate ! "
299596	299626	299588	299588	she	147	" Oh ! I am quite strong now to what I was . It would be a shame to be ill when everything is in its full summer beauty . "
299627	299645	299674	299674	he	6194	" I have heard how deeply we I am indebted to you my father can hardly praise you "
299646	299651	299653	299653	Molly	147	" Please do n't , "
299684	299710	299674	299674	he	6194	" Indeed , my little sister - in - law is never weary of talking about Monsieur le Docteur , as she calls your husband ! "
299711	299727	299729	299730	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I have not had the pleasure of making Mrs. Osborne Hamley 's acquaintance yet , "
299745	299834	299729	299730	Mrs. Gibson	189	" and I must beg you to apologize to her for my remissness . But Molly has been such a care and anxiety to me for , you know , I look upon her quite as my own child that I really have not gone anywhere ; excepting to the Towers , perhaps I should say , which is just like another home to me . And then I understood that Mrs. Osborne Hamley was thinking of returning to France before long ? Still it was very remiss . "
299861	299926	299856	299856	Roger	203	" I am sure Mrs. Osborne Hamley will be very glad to see any friends of the family , as soon as she is a little stronger . I hope she will not go back to France at all . She is an orphan , and I trust we shall induce her to remain with my father . But at present nothing is arranged . "
299937	299942	299936	299936	his	203	" visit of ceremony , "
300003	300009	300011	300011	he	203	" Poor Osborne was right ! "
300013	300057	300011	300011	he	203	" She has grown into delicate fragrant beauty , just as he said she would : or is it the character which has formed her face ? Now the next time I enter these doors , it will be to learn my fate ! "
300166	300347	300161	300161	she	995	" Your old admirer , Roger Hamley , has come home in a great hurry , in consequence of poor dear Osborne 's unexpected decease . He must have been rather surprised to find the widow and her little boy established at the Hall . He came to call here the other day , and made himself really rather agreeable , although his manners are not improved by the society he has kept on his travels . Still I prophesy he will be considered as a fashionable ' lion , ' and perhaps the very uncouthness which jars against my sense of refinement , may even become admired in a scientific traveller , who has been into more desert places , and eaten more extraordinary food , than any other Englishman of the day . I suppose he has given up all chance of inheriting the estate , for I hear he talks of returning to Africa , and becoming a regular wanderer . Your name was not mentioned , but I believe he inquired about you from Mr. Gibson . "
300348	300351	300353	300353	she	6204	" There ! "
300366	300427	300353	300353	she	6204	" that ca n't disturb her , or make her uncomfortable . And it 's all the truth too , or very near it . Of course he 'll want to see her when she comes back ; but by that time I do hope Mr. Henderson will have proposed again , and that that affair will be all settled . "
300461	300563	300454	300455	Mr. Henderson	427	" Why should he ? She had refused him once , and he did not know the reason of her refusal , at least one of the reasons . She did not know if she should have taken him if there had been no such person as Roger Hamley in the world . No ! Uncle and aunt Kirkpatrick had never heard anything about Roger 's offer , nor had her cousins . She had always declared her wish to keep it a secret , and she had not mentioned it to any one , whatever other people might have done . "
300672	300679	300668	300669	Mrs. Gibson	189	" enough to provoke a saint . "
300717	300740	300711	300712	the latter	1251	" Never mind , Molly . Mamma is only vexed because Mr. because I have not come back an engaged young lady . "
300741	300775	300777	300778	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes ; and I am sure you might have done , there 's the ingratitude ! I am not so unjust as to want you to do what you ca n't do ! "
300782	300812	300813	300813	Cynthia	252	" But where 's the ingratitude , mamma ? I 'm very much tired , and perhaps that makes me stupid ; but I can not see the ingratitude . "
300839	300882	300958	300959	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Why , do n't you see we are doing all we can for you ; dressing you well , and sending you to London ; and when you might relieve us of the expense of all this , you do n't . "
300883	300892	300894	300894	Molly	147	" No ! Cynthia , I will speak , "
300909	300946	300947	300947	She	147	" I am sure papa does not feel , and does not mind , any expense he incurs about his daughters . And I know quite well that he does not wish us to marry , unless "
300952	300956	300958	300959	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Unless what ? "
300965	300975	300977	300977	Molly	147	" Unless we love some one very dearly indeed , "
300986	301032	301034	301034	she	147	" Well , after this tirade really rather indelicate , I must say I have done . I will neither help nor hinder any love - affairs of you two young ladies . In my days we were glad of the advice of our elders . "
301066	301070	301061	301061	her	6210	" unfortunate entanglement , "
301072	301078	301061	301061	her	6210	" delicate sense of honour , "
301103	301108	301110	301110	Molly	147	" Oh , dear ! "
301132	301159	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" how cross I do get since I 've been ill ! But I could n't bear her to speak as if papa grudged you anything . "
301160	301311	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I 'm sure he does n't , Molly . You need not defend him on my account . But I 'm sorry mamma still looks upon me as ' an encumbrance , ' as the advertisements in The Times always call us unfortunate children . But I 've been an encumbrance to her all my life . I 'm getting very much into despair about everything , Molly . I shall try my luck in Russia . I 've heard of a situation as English governess at Moscow , in a family owning whole provinces of land , and serfs by the hundred . I put off writing my letter till I came home ; I shall be as much out of the way there as if I was married . Oh , dear ! travelling all night is n't good for the spirits . How is Mr. Preston ? "
301312	301366	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Oh , he has taken Cumnor Grange , three miles away , and he never comes in to the Hollingford tea - parties now . I saw him once in the street , but it 's a question which of us tried the hardest to get out of the other 's way . "
301367	301378	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You 've not said anything about Roger , yet . "
301379	301436	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No ; I did n't know if you would care to hear . He is very much older - looking ; quite a strong grown - up man . And papa says he is much graver . Ask me any questions , if you want to know , but I have only seen him once . "
301437	301461	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I was in hopes he would have left the neighbourhood by this time . Mamma said he was going to travel again . "
301462	301468	301470	301470	Molly	147	" I ca n't tell , "
301472	301478	301479	301479	she	147	" I suppose you know , "
301490	301498	301487	301487	she	147	" that he wishes to see you ? "
301499	301548	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No ! I never heard . I wish he would have been satisfied with my letter . It was as decided as I could make it . If I say I wo n't see him , I wonder if his will or mine will be the strongest ? "
301549	301552	301554	301554	Molly	147	" His , "
301556	301577	301554	301554	Molly	147	" But you must see him ; you owe it to him . He will never be satisfied without it . "
301578	301597	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Suppose he talks me round into resuming the engagement ? I should only break it off again . "
301598	301624	301626	301626	she	147	" Surely you ca n't be ' talked round ' if your mind is made up . But perhaps it is not really , Cynthia ? "
301639	301663	301126	301127	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It is quite made up . I am going to teach little Russian girls ; and am never going to marry nobody . "
301664	301681	301710	301711	CHAPTER LVI	497	" You are not serious , Cynthia . And yet it is a very serious thing . "
301713	301726	301760	301760	she	189	" OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE , AND ON WITH THE NEW . "
301959	301963	301965	301966	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear , "
301968	301999	301965	301966	Mrs. Gibson	189	" you are not eating your breakfast as you should do . I am afraid our meals seem very plain and homely to you after those in Hyde Park Street ? "
302000	302003	302005	302005	Cynthia	247	" No , "
302007	302017	302005	302005	Cynthia	247	" I 'm not hungry , that 's all . "
302018	302098	302113	302113	she	6217	" If we were as rich as your uncle , I should feel it to be both a duty and a pleasure to keep an elegant table ; but limited means are a sad clog to one 's wishes . I do n't suppose that , work as he will , Mr. Gibson can earn more than he does at present ; while the capabilities of the law are boundless . Lord Chancellor ! Titles as well as fortune ! "
302117	302130	302113	302113	she	6217	" Hundreds of briefless barristers . Take the other side , mamma . "
302131	302146	302113	302113	she	6217	" Well ; but I have noticed that many of these have private fortunes . "
302147	302163	302113	302113	she	6217	" Perhaps . Mamma , I expect Mr. Henderson will come and call this morning . "
302164	302187	302113	302113	she	6217	" Oh , my precious child ! But how do you know ? My darling Cynthia , am I to congratulate you ? "
302188	302222	302113	302113	she	6217	" No ! I suppose I must tell you . I have had a letter this morning from him , and he 's coming down by the ' Umpire ' to - day . "
302223	302240	302113	302113	she	6217	" But he has offered ? He surely must mean to offer , at any rate ? "
302272	302282	302113	302113	she	6217	" Offered ! yes , I suppose he has . "
302283	302301	302267	302268	her mother	552	" And you accept him ? Say ' yes , ' Cynthia , and make me happy ! "
302302	302328	302329	302329	She	6218	" I sha n't say ' yes ' to make any one happy except myself , and the Russian scheme has great charms for me . "
302405	302428	302474	302475	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You always look nice , dear ; but do n't you think you had better put on that pretty lilac silk ? "
302429	302447	302474	302475	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I shall not vary a thread or a shred from what I have got on now . "
302448	302467	302474	302475	Mrs. Gibson	189	" You dear , wilful creature ! you know you always look lovely in whatever you put on . "
302676	302704	302669	302669	she	147	" You shall be left alone now , little one . I want you to be very well and very bright this afternoon : so rest now . "
302911	302920	302921	302921	he	203	" Mrs. Gibson at home ? Miss Kirkpatrick ? "
302945	302974	302934	302934	She	147	" I think so I 'm not sure ! Will you walk up into the drawing - room , sir ? Miss Gibson is there , I know . "
303091	303101	303102	303102	he	203	" I am afraid you are not so well , "
303123	303134	303136	303136	she	147	" I 'm a little tired , that 's all , "
303500	303527	303497	303497	Click	216	" Molly , tell me ! Is it too late for me to speak to Cynthia ? I came on purpose . Who is that man ? "
303528	303555	303497	303497	Click	216	" Mr. Henderson . He only came to - day but now he is her accepted lover . Oh , Roger , forgive me the pain ! "
303556	303580	303497	303497	Click	216	" Tell her I have been , and am gone . Send out word to her . Do n't let her be interrupted . "
303616	303621	303622	303622	she	252	" Where is he ? "
303636	303639	303641	303641	Molly	147	" Gone ! "
303646	303697	303622	303622	she	252	" Gone . Oh , what a relief ! It seems to be my fate never to be off with the old lover before I am on with the new , and yet I did write as decidedly as I could . Why , Molly , what 's the matter ? "
303753	303756	303737	303737	she	252	" George , "
303894	303900	303902	303902	Cynthia	252	" Was he very terrible ? "
303920	303937	303905	303905	she	252	" Oh , Cynthia , it was such pain to see him , he suffered so ! "
303938	303948	303950	303950	Cynthia	252	" I do n't like people of deep feelings , "
303954	303980	303950	303950	Cynthia	252	" They do n't suit me . Why could n't he let me go without this fuss ? I 'm not worth his caring for ! "
303981	304005	303905	303905	she	252	" You have the happy gift of making people love you . Remember Mr. Preston , he too would n't give up hope . "
304006	304075	303950	303950	Cynthia	252	" Now I wo n't have you classing Roger Hamley and Mr. Preston together in the same sentence . One was as much too bad for me as the other is too good . Now I hope that man in the garden is the juste milieu , I 'm that myself , for I do n't think I 'm vicious , and I know I 'm not virtuous . "
304076	304087	304089	304089	Molly	147	" Do you really like him enough to marry him ? "
304092	304130	304089	304089	Molly	147	" Do think , Cynthia . It wo n't do to go on throwing your lovers off ; you give pain that I 'm sure you do not mean to do , that you can not understand . "
304131	304166	304167	304167	She	147	" Perhaps I ca n't . I 'm not offended . I never set up for what I am not , and I know I 'm not constant . I 've told Mr. Henderson so "
304177	304187	303950	303950	Cynthia	252	" You have ! and what did he say ? "
304188	304430	304167	304167	She	147	" That he liked me just as I was ; so you see he 's fairly warned . Only he 's a little afraid , I suppose , for he wants me to be married very soon , almost directly , in fact . But I do n't know if I shall give way , you hardly saw him , Molly , but he 's coming again to - night , and mind , I 'll never forgive you if you do n't think him very charming . I believe I cared for him when he offered all those months ago , but I tried to think I did n't ; only sometimes I really was so unhappy , I thought I must put an iron band round my heart to keep it from breaking , like the Faithful John of the German story , do you remember , Molly ? how when his master came to his crown and his fortune and his lady - love , after innumerable trials and disgraces , and was driving away from the church where he 'd been married in a coach and six , with Faithful John behind , the happy couple heard three great cracks in succession , and on inquiring , they were the iron - bands round his heart , that Faithful John had worn all during the time of his master 's tribulation , to keep it from breaking . "
304700	304716	304697	304697	he	238	" Well ! and how do you like the new relation that is to be ? "
304717	304742	304697	304697	he	238	" It 's difficult to say . I think he 's very nice in all his bits , but rather dull on the whole . "
304743	304749	304751	304752	Mr. Gibson	238	" I think him perfection , "
304777	304803	304773	304773	He	238	" I do n't wonder she preferred him to Roger Hamley . Such scents ! such gloves ! And then his hair and his cravat ! "
304804	304846	304697	304697	he	238	" Now , papa , you 're not fair . He is a great deal more than that . One could see that he had very good feeling ; and he is very handsome , and very much attached to her . "
304847	304908	304773	304773	He	238	" So was Roger . However , I must confess I shall be only too glad to have her married . She 's a girl who 'll always have some love - affair on hand , and will always be apt to slip through a man 's fingers if he does n't look sharp ; as I was saying to Roger "
304909	304922	304697	304697	he	238	" You have seen him , then , since he was here ? "
304923	304930	304773	304773	He	238	" Met him in the street . "
304931	304936	304697	304697	he	238	" How was he ? "
304937	305073	304773	304773	He	238	" I do n't suppose he 'd been going through the pleasantest thing in the world ; but he 'll get over it before long . He spoke with sense and resignation , and did n't say much about it ; but one could see that he was feeling it pretty sharply . He 's had three months to think it over , remember . The Squire , I should guess , is showing more indignation . He is boiling over , that any one should reject his son ! The enormity of the sin never seems to have been apparent to him till now , when he sees how Roger is affected by it . Indeed , with the exception of myself , I do n't know one reasonable father ; eh , Molly ? "
305157	305180	305128	305129	Mr. Gibson	238	" There ! that 's to pay your expenses to Russia and back . I hope you 'll find your pupils obedient . "
305202	305211	305213	305213	she	6263	" You are the kindest person I know , "
305215	305228	305213	305213	she	6263	" and I do n't know how to thank you in words . "
305229	305272	305182	305182	his	427	" If you tumble my shirt - collars again in that way , I 'll charge you for the washing . Just now , too , when I 'm trying so hard to be trim and elegant , like your Mr. Henderson . "
305273	305284	305286	305286	Cynthia	247	" But you do like him , do n't you ? "
305290	305297	305286	305286	Cynthia	247	" He does so like you . "
305298	305327	305182	305182	his	427	" Of course . We 're all angels just now , and you 're an arch - angel . I hope he 'll wear as well as Roger . "
305332	305340	305341	305341	she	6264	" That was a very silly affair , "
305344	305351	305341	305341	she	6264	" We were two as unsuitable people "
305352	305385	305182	305182	his	427	" It has ended , and that 's enough . Besides , I 've no more time to waste ; and there 's your smart young man coming here in all haste . "
305531	305539	305547	305547	Mr.	6272	" excuse the vanity of a mother , "
305614	305666	305676	305676	her	189	" Surely you do not mean the famous traveller , Hamley , about whose discoveries all our scientific men are so much excited . You speak of him as a young Hamley , who went to Africa . Answer this question , pray , for Helen is most anxious to know . "
305966	305973	305958	305958	She	150	" out of her own sphere , "
305981	305983	305958	305958	She	150	" Clare "
306015	306042	305996	305996	Maria	147	" Please , ma'am , the great carriage from the Towers is coming up to the gate , and my lady the Countess is sitting inside . "
306092	306152	306085	306086	The family	548	" as it were , till Lady Cumnor appeared in the drawing - room ; and then she had to be settled in the best chair , and the light adjusted before anything like conversation began . She was the first to speak ; and Lady Harriet , who had begun a few words to Molly , dropped into silence .
306153	306197	306200	306200	her	6289	" I have been taking Mary Lady Cuxhaven to the railway station on this new line between Birmingham and London , and I thought I would come on here , and offer you my congratulations . Clare , which is the young lady ? "
306217	306236	306238	306238	she	6289	" I did not think it would be amiss to give you a little advice , my dear , "
306253	306418	306238	306238	she	6289	" I have heard a good deal about you ; and I am only too glad , for your mother 's sake , your mother is a very worthy woman , and did her duty very well while she was in our family I am truly rejoiced , I say , to hear that you are going to make so creditable a marriage . I hope it will efface your former errors of conduct which , we will hope , were but trivial in reality and that you will live to be a comfort to your mother , for whom both Lord Cumnor and I entertain a very sincere regard . But you must conduct yourself with discretion in whatever state of life it pleases God to place you , whether married or single . You must reverence your husband , and conform to his opinion in all things . Look up to him as your head , and do nothing without consulting him . "
306441	306457	306433	306433	he	153	" Keep strict accounts ; and remember your station in life . I understand that Mr. "
306470	306525	306433	306433	he	153	" Anderson Henderson is in the law . Although there is a general prejudice against attorneys , I have known of two or three who were very respectable men ; and I am sure Mr. Henderson is one , or your good mother and our old friend Gibson would not have sanctioned the engagement . "
306526	306532	306535	306535	Cynthia	252	" He is a barrister , "
306544	306551	306535	306535	Cynthia	252	" Barrister - at - law . "
306552	306649	306433	306433	he	153	" Ah , yes . Attorney - at - law . Barrister - at - law . I understand without your speaking so loud , my dear . What was I going to say before you interrupted me ? When you have been a little in society you will find that it is reckoned bad manners to interrupt . I had a great deal more to say to you , and you have put it all out of my head . There was something else your father wanted me to ask what was it , Harriet ? "
306650	306659	306535	306535	Cynthia	252	" I suppose you mean about Mr. Hamley ? "
306660	306692	306433	306433	he	153	" Oh , yes ! we are intending to have the house full of Lord Hollingford 's friends next month , and Lord Cumnor is particularly anxious to secure Mr. Hamley . "
306693	306697	306699	306700	Mrs. Gibson	189	" The Squire ? "
306716	306727	306705	306706	Lady Cumnor	150	" If you did not interrupt me I should explain . "
306728	306771	306433	306433	he	153	" The famous traveller the scientific Mr. Hamley , I mean . I imagine he is son to the Squire . Lord Hollingford knows him well ; but when we asked him before , he declined coming , and assigned no reason . "
306794	306855	306790	306791	Lady Cumnor	150	" Now this time we are particularly anxious to secure him , and my son Lord Hollingford will not return to England until the very week before the Duke of Atherstone is coming to us . I believe Mr. Gibson is very intimate with Mr. Hamley ; do you think he could induce him to favour us with his company ? "
306928	306988	306915	306915	she	150	" Thank you . You know me well enough to be aware that I am not the person , nor is the Towers the house , to go about soliciting guests . But in this instance I bend my head ; high rank should always be the first to honour those who have distinguished themselves by art or science . "
306989	306994	306996	306997	Lady Harriet	168	" Besides , mamma , "
306999	307048	306996	306997	Lady Harriet	168	" papa was saying that the Hamleys have been on their land since before the Conquest ; while we only came into the county a century ago ; and there is a tale that the first Cumnor began his fortune through selling tobacco in King James 's reign . "
307260	307280	307286	307286	she	150	" If you are driving into Hollingford , Harriet , perhaps you will take these books to Miss Kirkpatrick , "
307305	307450	307286	307286	she	150	" I understand they are all going up to London to - morrow for this wedding , in spite of what I said to Clare of the duty of being married in one 's own parish - church . She told me at the time that she entirely agreed with me , but that her husband had such a strong wish for a visit to London , that she did not know how she could oppose him consistently with her wifely duty . I advised her to repeat to him my reasons for thinking that they would be ill - advised to have the marriage in town ; but I am afraid she has been overruled . That was her one great fault when she lived with us ; she was always so yielding , and never knew how to say ' No . ' "
307451	307454	307456	307457	Lady Harriet	168	" Mamma ! "
307468	307503	307456	307457	Lady Harriet	168	" Do you think you would have been so fond of her , if she had opposed you , and said ' No , ' when you wished her to say ' Yes ? ' "
307504	307589	307590	307590	she	6300	" To be sure I should , my dear . I like everybody to have an opinion of their own ; only when my opinions are based on thought and experience , which few people have had equal opportunities of acquiring , I think it is but proper deference in others to allow themselves to be convinced . In fact , I think it is only obstinacy which keeps them from acknowledging that they are . I am not a despot , I hope ? "
307597	307605	307607	307608	Lady Harriet	168	" If you are , dear mamma , "
307618	307654	307607	307608	Lady Harriet	168	" I like a despotism better than a republic , and I must be very despotic over my ponies , for it 's already getting very late for my drive round by Ash - holt . "
307748	307799	307896	307896	she	168	" You look like Marius sitting amidst the ruins of Carthage , my dear ! What 's the matter ? Why have you got on that wobegone face ? This marriage is n't broken off , is it ? Though nothing would surprise me where the beautiful Cynthia is concerned . "
307800	307832	307896	307896	she	168	" Oh , no ! that 's all right . But I have caught a fresh cold , and papa says he thinks I had better not go to the wedding . "
307833	307848	307896	307896	she	168	" Poor little one ! And it 's the first visit to London too ! "
307849	307872	307873	307873	she	168	" Yes . But what I most care for is the not being with Cynthia to the last ; and then , papa "
307901	307904	307905	307905	she	168	" Papa , "
307908	307976	307905	307905	she	168	" has so looked forward to this holiday , and seeing and , and going oh ! I ca n't tell you where ; but he has quite a list of people and sights to be seen , and now he says he should not be comfortable to leave me all alone for more than three days , two for travelling , and one for the wedding . "
308000	308125	307979	307980	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear Lady Harriet how kind of you ! Ah , yes , I see this poor unfortunate child has been telling you of her ill - luck ; just when everything was going on so beautifully ; I 'm sure it was that open window at your back , Molly , you know you would persist that it could do you no harm , and now you see the mischief ! I 'm sure I sha n't be able to enjoy myself and at my only child 's wedding too without you ; for I ca n't think of leaving you without Maria . I would rather sacrifice anything myself than think of you , uncared for , and dismal at home . "
308126	308138	308140	308141	Lady Harriet	168	" I am sure Molly is as sorry as any one , "
308143	308153	308155	308156	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No . I do n't think she is , "
308167	308233	308155	308156	Mrs. Gibson	189	" or she would not have sate with her back to an open window the day before yesterday , when I told her not . But it ca n't be helped now . Papa too but it is my duty to make the best of everything , and look at the cheerful side of life . I wish I could persuade her to do the same "
308240	308265	308155	308156	Mrs. Gibson	189	" But , you see , it is a great mortification to a girl of her age to lose her first visit to London . "
308266	308272	308274	308274	Molly	147	" It is not that , "
308292	308439	308277	308278	Lady Harriet	168	" Now , Clare ! you and I can manage it all , I think , if you will but help me in a plan I 've got in my head . Mr. Gibson shall stay as long as ever he can in London ; and Molly shall be well cared for , and have some change of air and scene too , which is really what she needs as much as anything , in my poor opinion . I ca n't spirit her to the wedding and give her a sight of London ; but I can carry her off to the Towers , and nurse her myself ; and send daily bulletins up to London , so that Mr. Gibson may feel quite at ease , and stay with you as long as you like . What do you say to it , Clare ? "
308440	308448	308450	308450	Molly	147	" Oh , I could not go , "
308452	308462	308450	308450	Molly	147	" I should only be a trouble to everybody . "
308463	308491	308277	308278	Lady Harriet	168	" Nobody asked you for your opinion , little one . If we wise elders decide that you are to go , you must submit in silence . "
308528	308532	308526	308526	herself	147	" their maid ; "
308588	308590	308587	308589	The " ayes	12163	" ayes "
308594	308636	308587	308589	The " ayes	12163	" What a charming plan ! I can not think of anything kinder or pleasanter for this poor darling . Only what will Lady Cumnor say ? I am modest for my family as much as for myself . She wo n't "
308637	308698	308587	308589	The " ayes	12163	" You know mamma 's sense of hospitality is never more gratified than when the house is quite full ; and papa is just like her . Besides , she is fond of you , and grateful to our good Mr. Gibson , and will be fond of you , little one , when she knows you as I do . "
308883	309054	309086	309086	she	252	" She shall have the south pink room , opening out of mine by one door , you remember ; and the dressing - room shall be made into a cosy little sitting - room for her , in case she likes to be by herself . Parkes shall attend upon her , and I 'm sure Mr. Gibson must know Parkes 's powers as a nurse by this time . We shall have all manner of agreeable people in the house to amuse her downstairs ; and when she has got rid of this access of cold , I will drive her out every day , and write daily bulletins , as I said . Pray tell Mr. Gibson all that , and let it be considered as settled . I will come for her in the close carriage to - morrow , at eleven . And now may I see the lovely bride - elect , and give her mamma 's present , and my own good wishes ? "
309506	309526	309503	309503	Cynthia	252	" I am not going to thank you , Molly , or to tell you how I love you . "
309527	309531	309533	309533	Molly	147	" Do n't , "
309535	309542	309533	309533	Molly	147	" I ca n't bear it . "
309543	309575	309503	309503	Cynthia	252	" Only you know you are to be my first visitor , and if you wear brown ribbons to a green gown , I 'll turn you out of the house ! "
309612	309619	309621	309621	he	238	" Think of us on Thursday , "
309623	309673	309621	309621	he	238	" I declare I do n't know which of her three lovers she may n't summon at the very last moment to act the part of bridegroom . I 'm determined to be surprised at nothing ; and will give her away with a good grace to whoever comes . "
309835	309846	309848	309848	she	150	" You are Lady Harriet 's visitor , my dear , "
309850	309873	309848	309848	she	150	" and I hope she will take good care of you . If not , come and complain of her to me . "
309907	310082	309896	309897	her mother	552	" Now , here you are in your own kingdom ; and into this room I sha n't venture to come without express permission . Here is the last new Quarterly , and the last new novel , and the last new Essays . Now , my dear , you need n't come down again to - day unless you like it . Parkes shall bring you everything and anything you want . You must get strong as fast as you can , for all sorts of great and famous people are coming to - morrow and the next day , and I think you 'll like to see them . Suppose for to - day you only come down to lunch , and if you like it , in the evening . Dinner is such a wearily long meal , if one is n't strong ; and you would n't miss much , for there 's only my cousin Charles in the house now , and he is the personification of sensible silence . "
310228	310281	310218	310219	Lady Harriet	168	" Now , Molly , this is Mrs. Parkes , the only person I am ever afraid of . She scolds me if I dirty myself with my paints , just as if I was a little child ; and she makes me go to bed when I want to sit up , "
310337	310337	310341	310341	her	505	"
310353	310389	310338	310338	Parkes	505	" If you will give me your keys , Miss , I will unpack your things , and let you know when it is time for me to arrange your hair , preparatory to luncheon . "
310429	310433	310435	310436	his aunt	6350	" cousin Charles , "
310578	310643	310569	310569	She	168	" Now , Charles , the girl wants to be interested and amused without having to take any trouble for herself ; she is too delicate to be very active either in mind or body . Just look after her when the house gets full , and place her where she can hear and see everything and everybody , without any fuss and responsibility . "
310985	311040	311079	311079	Cynthia	252	" If you can without fatigue , dear , do come down to dinner to - day ; you 'll then see the people one by one as they appear , instead of having to encounter a crowd of strangers . Hollingford will be here too . I hope you 'll find it pleasant . "
311816	311858	311789	311790	Lady Harriet	6399	" Really , Charles , considering that she is in your charge , I think you might have saved her from the chatter and patter of Mr. Watson ; I can only stand it when I am in the strongest health . "
312005	312011	312013	312013	he	203	" I was very unlucky , "
312015	312062	312013	312013	he	203	" I wanted to get near you last night , but it was quite impossible . You were so busy talking to Mr. Watson , until Sir Charles Morton came and carried you off with such an air of authority ! Have you known him long ? "
312098	312163	312228	312228	Molly	147	" No ! not long . I never saw him before I came here on Tuesday . But Lady Harriet told him to see that I did not get tired , for I wanted to come down ; but you know I have not been strong . He is a cousin of Lady Harriet 's , and does all she tells him to do . "
312164	312182	312228	312228	Molly	147	" Oh ! he is not handsome ; but I believe he is a very sensible man . "
312183	312203	312228	312228	Molly	147	" Yes ! I should think so . He is so silent though , that I can hardly judge . "
312204	312215	312217	312217	Roger	203	" He bears a very high character in the county , "
312232	312238	312239	312239	she	147	" I must go upstairs , "
312242	312259	312239	312239	she	147	" I only sate down here for a minute or two because Lady Harriet bade me . "
312260	312266	312268	312268	he	203	" Stop a little longer , "
312270	312326	312268	312268	he	203	" This is really the pleasantest place ; this basin of water - lilies gives one the idea , if not the sensation , of coolness ; besides it seems so long since I saw you , and I have a message from my father to give you . He is very angry with you . "
312327	312332	312334	312334	Molly	147	" Angry with me ? "
312338	312380	312268	312268	he	203	" Yes ! He heard that you had come here for change of air ; and he was offended that you had n't come to us to the Hall , instead . He said that you should have remembered old friends ! "
312400	312408	312410	312410	she	147	" Oh ! I am so sorry ! "
312412	312441	312410	312410	she	147	" But will you please tell him how it all happened . Lady Harriet called the very day when it was settled that I was not to go to "
312467	312500	312453	312453	she	147	" go to London , and she planned it all in a minute , and convinced mamma and papa , and had her own way . There was really no resisting her . "
312501	312538	312453	312453	she	147	" I think you will have to tell all this to my father yourself if you mean to make your peace . Why can you not come on to the Hall when you leave the Towers ? "
312578	312604	312574	312574	She	147	" I should like it very much , some time . But I must go home first . They will want me more than ever now "
312744	312749	312751	312751	he	203	" Ah , yes ! "
312753	312778	312751	312751	he	203	" Of course you must be of double importance now Miss Kirkpatrick has left you . I saw her marriage in The Times yesterday . "
312808	312811	312812	312812	he	203	" Still , "
312815	312857	312812	312812	he	203	" I think I must urge my father 's claim for a short visit , and all the more , because I can really see the apparent improvement in your health since I came , only yesterday . Besides , Molly , "
312871	312940	312812	312812	he	203	" I think you could help us at home . Aimťe is shy and awkward with my father , and he has never taken quite kindly to her , yet I know they would like and value each other , if some one could but bring them together , and it would be such a comfort to me if this could take place before I have to leave . "
312941	312950	312812	312812	he	203	" To leave are you going away again ? "
312951	312976	312812	312812	he	203	" Yes . Have you not heard ? I did n't complete my engagement . I 'm going again in September for six months . "
312977	312999	312812	312812	he	203	" I remember . But somehow I fancied you seemed to have settled down into the old ways at the Hall . "
313000	313087	312812	312812	he	203	" So my father appears to think . But it is not likely I shall ever make it my home again ; and that is partly the reason why I want my father to adopt the notion of Aimťe 's living with him . Ah , here are all the people coming back from their walk . However , I shall see you again ; perhaps this afternoon we may get a little quiet time , for I have a great deal to consult you about . "
313364	313390	313361	313361	she	168	" Do n't you think that your pattern young man , and my favourite young woman , are finding out each other 's good qualities ? "
313401	313407	313409	313409	he	188	" Who do you mean ? "
313411	313421	313361	313361	she	168	" Look along the avenue ; who are those ? "
313422	313477	313361	313361	she	168	" Mr. Hamley and is it not Miss Gibson ? I ca n't quite make out . Oh ! if you 're letting your fancy run off in that direction , I can tell you it 's quite waste of time . Roger Hamley is a man who will soon have an European reputation ! "
313478	313504	313361	313361	she	168	" That 's very possible , and yet it does n't make any difference in my opinion . Molly Gibson is capable of appreciating him . "
313505	313529	313361	313361	she	168	" She is a very pretty , good little country - girl . I do n't mean to say anything against her , but "
313530	313586	313361	313361	she	168	" Remember the Charity Ball ; you called her ' unusually intelligent ' after you had danced with her there . But , after all , we are like the genie and the fairy in the Arabian Nights ' Entertainment , who each cried up the merits of the Prince Caramalzaman and the Princess Badoura . "
313587	313595	313361	313361	she	168	" Hamley is not a marrying man . "
313596	313602	313361	313361	she	168	" How do you know ? "
313603	313632	313361	313361	she	168	" I know that he has very little private fortune , and I know that science is not a remunerative profession , if profession it can be called . "
313633	313664	313361	313361	she	168	" Oh , if that 's all a hundred things may happen some one may leave him a fortune or this tiresome little heir that nobody wanted , may die . "
313665	313706	313361	313361	she	168	" Hush , Harriet , that 's the worst of allowing yourself to plan far ahead for the future ; you are sure to contemplate the death of some one , and to reckon upon the contingency as affecting events . "
313707	313720	313361	313361	she	168	" As if lawyers were not always doing something of the kind ! "
313721	313744	313361	313361	she	168	" Leave it to those to whom it is necessary . I dislike planning marriages or looking forward to deaths about equally . "
313745	313756	313361	313361	she	168	" You are getting very prosaic and tiresome , Hollingford ! "
313757	313761	313763	313763	he	6428	" Only getting ! "
313766	313785	313763	313763	he	6428	" I thought you had always looked upon me as a tiresome matter - of - fact fellow . "
313786	313841	313852	313852	Roger	203	" Now , if you 're going to fish for a compliment I am gone . Only remember my prophecy when my vision comes to pass ; or make a bet , and whoever wins shall spend the money on a present to Prince Caramalzaman or Princess Badoura , as the case may be . "
313867	313897	313852	313852	Roger	203	" Then I may tell my father that you will come and pay him a visit next week ? You do n't know what pleasure it will give him . "
313906	313911	313852	313852	Roger	203	" will give us , "
314047	314052	314054	314054	she	147	" Ah , Molly , "
314056	314287	314054	314054	she	147	" it 's really wonderful to see what a little good society will do for a girl . Even a week of association with such people as one meets with at the Towers is , as somebody said of a lady of rank whose name I have forgotten , ' a polite education in itself . ' There is something quite different about you a je ne sais quoi that would tell me at once that you have been mingling with the aristocracy . With all her charms , it was what my darling Cynthia wanted ; not that Mr. Henderson thought so , for a more devoted lover can hardly be conceived . He absolutely bought her a parure of diamonds . I was obliged to say to him that I had studied to preserve her simplicity of taste , and that he must not corrupt her with too much luxury . But I was rather disappointed at their going off without a maid . It was the one blemish in the arrangements the spot in the sun . Dear Cynthia , when I think of her , I do assure you , Molly , I make it my nightly prayer that I may be able to find you just such another husband . And all this time you have never told me who you met at the Towers ? "
314302	314316	314288	314288	Molly	147	" Upon my word ! That young man is pushing his way up ! "
314317	314329	314331	314331	Molly	147	" The Hamleys are a far older family than the Cumnors , "
314336	314413	314288	314288	Molly	147	" Now , Molly , I ca n't have you democratic . Rank is a great distinction . It is quite enough to have dear papa with democratic tendencies . But we wo n't begin to quarrel . Now that you and I are left alone , we ought to be bosom friends , and I hope we shall be . Roger Hamley did not say much about that unfortunate little Osborne Hamley , I suppose ? "
314414	314438	314288	314288	Molly	147	" On the contrary , he says his father dotes on the child ; and he seemed very proud of him , himself . "
314439	314486	314288	314288	Molly	147	" I thought the Squire must be getting very much infatuated with something . I daresay the French mother takes care of that . Why ! he has scarcely taken any notice of you for this month or more , and before that you were everything . "
314522	314562	314519	314519	she	147	" The Squire has sent me an invitation to go and stay there next week if you have no objection , mamma . They seem to want a companion for Mrs. Osborne Hamley , who is not very strong . "
314563	314747	314519	314519	she	147	" I can hardly tell what to say , I do n't like your having to associate with a Frenchwoman of doubtful rank ; and I ca n't bear the thought of losing my child my only daughter now . I did ask Helen Kirkpatrick , but she ca n't come for some time ; and the house is going to be altered . Papa has consented to build me another room at last , for Cynthia and Mr. Henderson will , of course , come and see us ; we shall have many more visitors , I expect , and your bedroom will make a capital lumber - room ; and Maria wants a week 's holiday . I am always so unwilling to put any obstacles in the way of any one 's pleasure , weakly unwilling , I believe , but it certainly would be very convenient to have you out of the house for a few days ; so , for once , I will waive my own wish for your companionship , and plead your cause with papa . "
314883	314888	314890	314891	Miss Browning	159	" Now , Molly , "
314893	314930	314890	314891	Miss Browning	159	" let us hear how you behaved among the great folks . You must not be set up with all their attention ; remember that they pay it to you for your good father 's sake . "
314931	314941	314944	314945	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly is , I think , quite aware , "
314955	315023	314944	314945	Mrs. Gibson	189	" that she owes her privilege of visiting at such a house to Lady Cumnor 's kind desire to set my mind quite at liberty at the time of Cynthia 's marriage . As soon as ever I had returned home , Molly came back ; indeed , I should not have thought it right to let her intrude upon their kindness beyond what was absolutely necessary . "
315043	315050	315052	315053	Miss Browning	159	" Well , but , Molly ! "
315055	315091	315052	315053	Miss Browning	159	" never mind whether you went there on your own merits , or your worthy father 's merits , or Mrs. Gibson 's merits ; but tell us what you did when you were there . "
315188	315237	315177	315178	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly has fallen into rambling ways with this visit of hers , of which she makes so much , as if nobody had ever been in a great house but herself . She is going to Hamley Hall next week , getting quite dissipated , in fact . "
315284	315327	315280	315281	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Well ! Mrs. Gibson , I suppose I must wish you joy of Miss Cynthia 's marriage ; I should condole with some mothers as had lost their daughters ; but you 're not one of that sort , I reckon . "
315341	315363	315331	315332	Mrs. Gibson	189	" of mothers the greatest credit was to be attached , she found it a little difficult how to frame her reply .
315364	315368	315369	315369	she	189	" Dear Cynthia ! "
315372	315384	315385	315385	she	189	" One ca n't but rejoice in her happiness ! And yet "
315392	315478	315331	315332	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Ay . She was a young woman as would always have her followers ; for , to tell the truth , she was as pretty a creature as ever I saw in my life . And all the more she needed skilful guidance . I 'm sure I , for one , am as glad as can be she 's done so well by herself . Folks say Mr. Henderson has a handsome private fortune over and above what he makes by the law . "
315479	315496	315498	315499	Mrs. Gibson	189	" There is no fear but that my Cynthia will have everything this world can give ! "
315503	315530	315532	315532	she	6445	" Well , well ! she was always a bit of a favourite of mine ; and as I was saying to my grand - daughter there "
315552	315606	315536	315550	a young lady , who looked keenly to the prospect of some wedding - cake	6446	" I was never one of those who ran her down and called her a flirt and a jilt . I 'm glad to hear she 's like to be so well off . And now , I suppose , you 'll be turning your mind to doing something for Miss Molly there ? "
315607	315677	315532	315532	she	6445	" If you mean by that , doing anything that can , by hastening her marriage , deprive me of the company of one who is like my own child , you are very much mistaken , Mrs. Goodenough . And pray remember , I am the last person in the world to match - make . Cynthia made Mr. Henderson 's acquaintance at her uncle 's in London . "
315678	315730	315536	315550	a young lady , who looked keenly to the prospect of some wedding - cake	6446	" Ay ! I thought her cousin was very often ill , and needing her nursing , and you were very keen she should be of use . I 'm not saying but what it 's right in a mother ; I 'm only putting in a word for Miss Molly . "
315731	315738	315740	315740	Molly	147	" Thank you , Mrs. Goodenough , "
315750	315771	315740	315740	Molly	147	" When I want to be married , I 'll not trouble mamma . I 'll look out for myself . "
315772	315790	315792	315793	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Molly is becoming so popular , I hardly know how we shall keep her at home , "
315795	315911	315792	315793	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I miss her sadly ; but , as I said to Mr. Gibson , let young people have change , and see a little of the world while they are young . It has been a great advantage to her being at the Towers while so many clever and distinguished people were there . I can already see a difference in her tone of conversation : an elevation in her choice of subjects . And now she is going to Hamley Hall . I can assure you I feel quite a proud mother , when I see how she is sought after . And my other daughter my Cynthia writing such letters from Paris ! "
315912	315925	315927	315928	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" Things is a deal changed since my days , for sure , "
315930	316130	315927	315928	Mrs. Goodenough	165	" So , perhaps , I 'm no judge . When I was married first , him and me went in a postchaise to his father 's house , a matter of twenty mile off at the outside ; and sate down to as good a supper amongst his friends and relations as you 'd wish to see . And that was my first wedding jaunt . My second was when I better knowed my worth as a bride , and thought that now or never I must see London . But I were reckoned a very extravagant sort of a body to go so far , and spend my money , though Harry had left me uncommon well off . But now young folks go off to Paris , and think nothing of the cost : and it 's well if wilful waste do n't make woeful want before they die . But I 'm thankful somewhat is being done for Miss Molly 's chances , as I said afore . It 's not quite what I should have liked to have done for my Annabella though . But times are changed , as I said just now . "
316279	316311	316314	316314	she	147	" That Mrs. Gibson is a deep ' un . There 's Mr. Roger Hamley as like as not to have the Hall estate , and she sends Molly a - visiting "
316599	316612	316582	316582	he	511	" The more ye ask us the more we wo n't stir . "
317359	317425	317355	317355	himself	1206	" Well ! and so you can come here a - visiting though you have been among the grand folks . I thought you were going to cut us , Miss Molly , when I heard you was gone to the Towers . Could n't find any other place to stay at while father and mother were away , but an earl 's , eh ? "
317426	317435	317437	317437	Molly	147	" They asked me , and I went , "
317439	317452	317437	317437	Molly	147	" now you 've asked me , and I 've come here . "
317453	317492	317494	317494	his	6498	" I think you might ha ' known you 'd be always welcome here , without waiting for asking . Why , Molly ! I look upon you as a kind of a daughter more than Madam there ! "
317515	317534	317494	317494	his	6498	" Nay , you need n't look at me so pitifully , she does n't follow English readily . "
317535	317541	317543	317543	Molly	147	" I think she does ! "
317624	317635	317637	317638	the Squire	1206	" He 's a sturdy chap , is n't he ? "
317648	317667	317637	317638	the Squire	1206	" And he can puff four puffs at grandpapa 's pipe without being sick , ca n't he ? "
317668	317676	317678	317679	the boy	9890	" I s'ant puff any more puffs , "
317683	317693	317678	317679	the boy	9890	" Mamma says ' No . ' I s'ant . "
317694	317701	317703	317704	the Squire	1206	" That 's just like her ! "
317713	317724	317707	317707	his	1206	" As if it could do the child any harm ! "
318005	318043	317997	317997	she	482	" Do n't you like Roger ? You would , if you only knew how good he is ! He is learned , but that is nothing : it is his goodness that one admires and loves . "
318044	318050	318052	318052	Molly	482	" He is very good , "
318054	318065	317997	317997	she	482	" I have known him long enough to know that . "
318066	318116	317997	317997	she	482	" But you do n't think him agreeable ? He is not like my poor husband , to be sure ; and you knew him well , too . Ah ! tell me about him once again . When you first knew him ? When his mother was alive ? "
318503	318607	318492	318492	he	203	" I thought I should find thee here , my lad ! We 'll have the old room done up again before winter ; it smells musty enough , and yet I see it 's the place for thee ! I want thee to go with me round the five - acre . I 'm thinking of laying it down in grass . It 's time for you to be getting into the fresh air , you look quite wobegone over books , books , books ; there never was a thing like 'em for stealing a man 's health out of him ! "
318659	318697	318631	318631	he	203	" Father , you remember I 'm going out again to the Cape next month ! You spoke of doing up the library . If it is for me , I shall be away all the winter . "
318698	318706	318708	318709	his father	952	" Ca n't you get off it ? "
318711	318722	318708	318709	his father	952	" I thought maybe you 'd forgotten all about it . "
318723	318727	318729	318729	Roger	203	" Not likely ! "
318734	318750	318708	318709	his father	952	" Well , but they might have found another man to finish up your work . "
318751	318793	318708	318709	his father	952	" No one can finish it but myself . Besides , an engagement is an engagement . When I wrote to Lord Hollingford to tell him I must come home , I promised to go out again for another six months . "
318794	318832	318708	318709	his father	952	" Ay . I know . And perhaps it will put it out of thy mind . It will always be hard on me to part from thee . But I daresay it 's best for you . "
318838	318907	318833	318833	Roger	203	" You are alluding to to Miss Kirkpatrick Mrs. Henderson , I mean . Father , let me tell you once for all , I think that was rather a hasty affair . I 'm pretty sure now that we were not suited to each other . I was wretched when I got her letter at the Cape I mean but I believe it was for the best . "
318908	318919	318921	318922	the Squire	1206	" That 's right . That 's my own boy , "
318934	318966	318921	318922	the Squire	1206	" And now I 'll tell you what I heard the other day , when I was at the magistrates ' meeting . They were all saying she had jilted Preston . "
318967	318995	318833	318833	Roger	203	" I do n't want to hear anything against her ; she may have her faults , but I can never forget how I once loved her . "
318996	319093	318921	318922	the Squire	1206	" Well , well ! Perhaps it 's right . I was not so bad about it , was I , Roger ? Poor Osborne need not ha ' been so secret with me . I asked your Miss Cynthia out here and her mother and all my bark is worse than my bite . For , if I had a wish on earth , it was to see Osborne married as befitted one of an old stock , and he went and chose out this French girl , of no family at all , only a "
319094	319122	318833	318833	Roger	203	" Never mind what she was ; look at what she is ! I wonder you are not more taken with her humility and sweetness , father ! "
319123	319132	319134	319135	the Squire	1206	" I do n't even call her pretty , "
319164	319267	319139	319139	he	1206	" Now your Miss Cynthia was pretty , I will say that for her , the baggage ! And to think that when you two lads flew right in your father 's face , and picked out girls below you in rank and family , you should neither of you have set your fancies on my little Molly there . I daresay I should ha ' been angry enough at the time , but the lassie would ha ' found her way to my heart , as never this French lady , nor t ' other one , could ha ' done . "
319273	319324	319268	319268	Roger	203	" I do n't see why you might n't put up for her still . I 'm humble enough now , and you 're not heir as Osborne was who married a servant - maid . Do n't you think you could turn your thoughts upon Molly Gibson , Roger ? "
319325	319328	319330	319330	Roger	203	" No ! "
319334	319362	319330	319330	Roger	203	" It 's too late too late . Do n't let us talk any more of my marrying . Is n't this the five - acre field ? "
319425	319441	319419	319419	he	1206	" But do n't you think you could like her if you tried , Roger ? "
319480	319508	319472	319472	he	203	" I shall never try , father . Do n't let us talk any more about it . As I said before , it 's too late . "
319679	319860	319861	319861	he	6544	" I wish I might never hear of her again I do . She 's been the bane of my Roger , that 's what she has . I have n't slept half the night , and it 's all her fault . Why , there 's my boy saying now that he has no heart for ever marrying , poor lad ! I wish it had been you , Molly , my lads had taken a fancy for . I told Roger so t'other day , and I said that for all you were beneath what I ever thought to see them marry , well it 's of no use it 's too late , now , as he said . Only never let me hear that baggage 's name again , that 's all , and no offence to you either , lassie . I know you love the wench ; but if you 'll take an old man 's word , you 're worth a score of her . I wish young men would think so too , "
320391	320396	320398	320398	he	203	" Look , Molly ! "
320418	320428	320429	320429	He	203	" I gathered these flowers for you before breakfast . "
320437	320441	320443	320443	she	147	" Thank you ! "
320445	320459	320443	320443	she	147	" You are very kind . I am very much obliged to you . "
320460	320469	320471	320471	he	203	" Then you must do something for me , "
320516	320550	320551	320551	His	203	" Tell me , honestly as I know you will if you speak at all , have n't I done something to vex you since we were so happy at the Towers together ? "
320680	320694	320696	320696	she	147	" No , you never vexed me in my whole life , Roger , "
320710	320749	320696	320696	she	147	" I believe you , because you say so . I have no right to ask further . Molly , will you give me back one of those flowers , as a pledge of what you have said ? "
320750	320756	320758	320758	she	147	" Take whichever you like , "
320770	320784	320696	320696	she	147	" No ; you must choose , and you must give it me . "
320823	320841	320820	320820	she	147	" Oh , please , Mr. Hamley , do you know which is Roger 's favourite flower ? "
320842	320873	320820	320820	she	147	" No . A rose , I daresay . The carriage is at the door , and , Molly my dear , I do n't want to hurry you , but "
320874	320886	320820	320820	she	147	" I know . Here , Roger , here is a rose !
320887	320896	320820	320820	she	147	" And red as a rose was she . "
320915	320915	320820	320820	she	147	"
320916	320930	320820	320820	she	147	" I 'm afraid he 's beginning of some kind of a fever . "
320970	320992	320956	320956	he	203	" Too late or not ? Can she ever forget that my first foolish love was given to one so different ? "
321007	321052	320994	320994	she	0	" We are friends again . I do n't believe he will remember what the dear Squire took it into his head to suggest for many days . It is so pleasant to be on the old terms again ! and what lovely flowers ! "
321329	321331	321336	321336	he	203	" trying "
321686	321706	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Considering all the trouble I had with her trousseau , I think she might have written to me . "
321707	321720	321722	321722	Molly	147	" But she did her first letter was to you , mamma , "
321746	321805	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Yes , just a first letter , three pages long , with an account of her crossing ; while to you she can write about fashions , and how the bonnets are worn in Paris , and all sorts of interesting things . But poor mothers must never expect confidential letters , I have found that out . "
321806	321815	321817	321817	Molly	147	" You may see my letter , mamma , "
321819	321827	321817	321817	Molly	147	" there is really nothing in it . "
321828	321868	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" And to think of her writing , and crossing to you who do n't value it , while my poor heart is yearning after my lost child ! Really , life is somewhat hard to bear at times . "
321877	321902	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Do tell me something about your visit , Molly . Is Roger very heart - broken ? Does he talk much about Cynthia ? "
321903	321919	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" No . He does not mention her often ; hardly ever , I think . "
321920	321944	321657	321658	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I never thought he had much feeling . If he had had , he would not have let her go so easily . "
321945	321981	321983	321983	Molly	147	" I do n't see how he could help it . When he came to see her after his return , she was already engaged to Mr. Henderson he had come down that very day , "
321994	321999	322001	322002	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My poor head ! "
322012	322147	322005	322005	her	189	" One may see you 've been stopping with people of robust health , and excuse my saying it , Molly , of your friends of unrefined habits , you 've got to talk in so loud a voice . But do remember my head , Molly . So Roger has quite forgotten Cynthia , has he ? Oh ! what inconstant creatures men are ! He will be falling in love with some grandee next , mark my words ! They are making a pet and a lion of him , and he 's just the kind of weak young man to have his head turned by it all ; and to propose to some fine lady of rank , who would no more think of marrying him than of marrying her footman . "
322148	322157	322159	322159	Molly	147	" I do n't think it is likely , "
322163	322174	322159	322159	Molly	147	" Roger is too sensible for anything of the kind . "
322175	322286	322005	322005	her	189	" That 's just the fault I always found with him ; sensible and cold - hearted ! Now , that 's a kind of character which may be very valuable , but which revolts me . Give me warmth of heart , even with a little of that extravagance of feeling which misleads the judgment , and conducts into romance . Poor Mr. Kirkpatrick ! That was just his character . I used to tell him that his love for me was quite romantic . I think I have told you about his walking five miles in the rain to get me a muffin once when I was ill ? "
322287	322290	322292	322292	Molly	147	" Yes ! "
322294	322302	322292	322292	Molly	147	" It was very kind of him . "
322303	322335	322005	322005	her	189	" So imprudent , too ! Just what one of your sensible , cold - hearted , commonplace people would never have thought of doing . With his cough and all . "
322336	322346	322348	322348	Molly	147	" I hope he did n't suffer for it ? "
322384	322468	322469	322469	She	147	" Yes , indeed , he did ! I do n't think he ever got over the cold he caught that day . I wish you had known him , Molly . I sometimes wonder what would have happened if you had been my real daughter , and Cynthia dear papa 's , and Mr. Kirkpatrick and your own dear mother had all lived . People talk a good deal about natural affinities . It would have been a question for a philosopher . "
322480	322490	322492	322492	Molly	147	" I wonder how the poor little boy is ? "
322503	322531	322476	322476	she	147	" Poor little child ! When one thinks how little his prolonged existence is to be desired , one feels that his death would be a boon . "
322532	322540	322542	322542	Molly	147	" Mamma ! what do you mean ? "
322547	322585	322542	322542	Molly	147	" Why , every one cares for his life as the most precious thing ! You have never seen him ! He is the bonniest , sweetest little fellow that can be ! What do you mean ? "
322586	322663	322476	322476	she	147	" I should have thought that the Squire would have desired a better - born heir than the offspring of a servant , with all his ideas about descent and blood and family . And I should have thought that it was a little mortifying to Roger who must naturally have looked upon himself as his brother 's heir to find a little interloping child , half French , half English , stepping into his shoes ! "
322664	322688	322542	322542	Molly	147	" You do n't know how fond they are of him , the Squire looks upon him as the apple of his eye . "
322689	322750	322476	322476	she	147	" Molly ! Molly ! pray do n't let me hear you using such vulgar expressions . When shall I teach you true refinement that refinement which consists in never even thinking a vulgar , commonplace thing ! Proverbs and idioms are never used by people of education . ' Apple of his eye ! ' I am really shocked . "
322751	322803	322805	322805	she	6600	" Well , mamma , I 'm very sorry ; but after all , what I wanted to say as strongly as I could was , that the Squire loves the little boy as much as his own child ; and that Roger oh ! what a shame to think that Roger "
322816	322828	322830	322831	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I do n't wonder at your indignation , my dear ! "
322833	322886	322830	322831	Mrs. Gibson	189	" It is just what I should have felt at your age . But one learns the baseness of human nature with advancing years . I was wrong , though , to undeceive you so early but depend upon it , the thought I alluded to has crossed Roger Hamley 's mind ! "
322887	322907	322909	322909	Molly	147	" All sorts of thoughts cross one 's mind it depends upon whether one gives them harbour and encouragement , "
322911	322983	322830	322831	Mrs. Gibson	189	" My dear , if you must have the last word , do n't let it be a truism . But let us talk on some more interesting subject . I asked Cynthia to buy me a silk gown in Paris , and I said I would send her word what colour I fixed upon I think dark blue is the most becoming to my complexion ; what do you say ? "
323065	323071	323073	323073	Molly	147	" How is little Roger ? "
323077	323129	323055	323055	his	238	" Beginning with scarlet fever , I 'm afraid . It 's well you left when you did , Molly . You 've never had it . We must stop up all intercourse with the Hall for a time . If there 's one illness I dread , it is this . "
323130	323142	323055	323055	his	238	" But you go and come back to us , papa . "
323143	323181	323055	323055	his	238	" Yes . But I always take plenty of precautions . However , no need to talk about risks that lie in the way of one 's duty . It is unnecessary risks that we must avoid . "
323182	323189	323191	323191	Molly	147	" Will he have it badly ? "
323193	323209	323055	323055	his	238	" I ca n't tell . I shall do my best for the wee laddie . "
323420	323467	323416	323417	her father	675	" As the country - people say , I 've done a stroke of work to - day . Roger Hamley and I have laid our heads together , and we 've made a plan by which Mrs. Osborne and her boy will leave the Hall . "
323468	323479	323481	323482	Mrs. Gibson	189	" What did I say the other day , Molly ? "
323495	323516	323518	323519	Mr. Gibson	238	" And go into lodgings at Jennings ' farm ; not four hundred yards from the Park - field gate , "
323521	323651	323518	323519	Mr. Gibson	238	" The Squire and his daughter - in - law have got to be much better friends over the little fellow 's sick - bed ; and I think he sees now how impossible it would be for the mother to leave her child , and go and be happy in France , which has been the notion running in his head all this time . To buy her off , in fact . But that one night , when I was very uncertain whether I could bring him through , they took to crying together , and condoling with each other ; and it was just like tearing down a curtain that had been between them ; they have been rather friends than otherwise ever since . Still Roger "
323673	323886	323887	323887	he	6611	" and I both agree that his mother knows much better how to manage the boy than his grandfather does . I suppose that was the one good thing she got from that hard - hearted mistress of hers . She certainly has been well trained in the management of children . And it makes her impatient , and annoyed , and unhappy , when she sees the Squire giving the child nuts and ale , and all sorts of silly indulgences , and spoiling him in every possible way . Yet she 's a coward , and does n't speak out her mind . Now by being in lodgings , and having her own servants nice pretty rooms they are , too ; we went to see them , and Mrs. Jennings promises to attend well to Mrs. Osborne Hamley , and is very much honoured , and all that sort of thing not ten minutes ' walk from the Hall , too , so that she and the little chap may easily go backwards and forwards as often as they like , and yet she may keep the control over the child 's discipline and diet . In short , I think I 've done a good day 's work , "
323924	323931	323932	323932	he	6611	" A good day 's work ! "
323941	323953	323932	323932	he	6611	" I do n't know when I have been so happy ! "
323999	324016	324018	324018	Roger	203	" You know that I set off next Tuesday , Mr. Gibson , do n't you ? "
324024	324059	323979	323980	Mr. Gibson	238	" To be sure . I hope you 'll be as successful in all your scientific objects as you were the last time , and have no sorrows awaiting you when you come back . "
324060	324085	324018	324018	Roger	203	" Thank you . Yes . I hope so . You do n't think there 's any danger of infection now , do you ? "
324086	324123	323979	323980	Mr. Gibson	238	" No ! If the disease were to spread through the household , I think we should have had some signs of it before now . One is never sure , remember , with scarlet fever . "
324133	324139	324140	324140	he	203	" Should you be afraid , "
324145	324153	324140	324140	he	203	" of seeing me at your house ? "
324154	324216	323979	323980	Mr. Gibson	238	" Thank you ; but I think I would rather decline the pleasure of your society there at present . It 's only three weeks or a month since the child began . Besides , I shall be over here again before you go . I 'm always on my guard against symptoms of dropsy . I have known it supervene . "
324217	324226	324228	324228	Roger	203	" Then I shall not see Molly again ! "
324292	324295	324297	324297	he	238	" Whew ! "
324308	324328	324329	324329	he	203	" You will take a message to her from me , wo n't you ? A message of farewell ? "
324332	324388	324299	324299	Roger	203	" Not I. I 'm not going to be a message - carrier between any young man and young woman . I 'll tell my womenkind I forbade you to come near the house , and that you 're sorry to go away without bidding good - by . That 's all I shall say . "
324389	324441	324470	324470	he	238	" But you do not disapprove ? I see you guess why . Oh ! Mr. Gibson , just speak to me one word of what must be in your heart , though you are pretending not to understand why I would give worlds to see Molly again before I go . "
324442	324447	324449	324450	Mr. Gibson	238	" My dear boy ! "
324480	324510	324470	324470	he	238	" Mind , Molly is not Cynthia . If she were to care for you , she is not one who could transfer her love to the next comer . "
324511	324522	324524	324524	Roger	203	" You mean not as readily as I have done , "
324526	324546	324470	324470	he	238	" I only wish you could know what a different feeling this is to my boyish love for Cynthia . "
324547	324588	324470	324470	he	238	" I was n't thinking of you when I spoke ; but , however , as I might have remembered afterwards that you were not a model of constancy , let us hear what you have to say for yourself . "
324589	324812	324470	324470	he	238	" Not much . I did love Cynthia very much . Her manners and her beauty bewitched me ; but her letters , short , hurried letters , sometimes showing that she really had n't taken the trouble to read mine through , I can not tell you the pain they gave me ! Twelve months ' solitude , in frequent danger of one 's life face to face with death sometimes ages a man like many years ' experience . Still I longed for the time when I should see her sweet face again , and hear her speak . Then the letter at the Cape ! and still I hoped . But you know how I found her , when I went to have the interview which I trusted might end in the renewal of our relations , engaged to Mr. Henderson . I saw her walking with him in your garden , coquetting with him about a flower , just as she used to do with me . I can see the pitying look in Molly 's eyes as she watched me ; I can see it now . And I could beat myself for being such a blind fool as to What must she think of me ? how she must despise me , choosing the false Duessa . "
324813	324835	324470	324470	he	238	" Come , come ! Cynthia is n't so bad as that . She 's a very fascinating , faulty creature . "
324836	324933	324470	324470	he	238	" I know ! I know ! I will never allow any one to say a word against her . If I called her the false Duessa it was because I wanted to express my sense of the difference between her and Molly as strongly as I could . You must allow for a lover 's exaggeration . Besides , all I wanted to say was , Do you think that Molly , after seeing and knowing that I had loved a person so inferior to herself , could ever be brought to listen to me ? "
324934	325000	324470	324470	he	238	" I do n't know . I ca n't tell . And even if I could , I would n't . Only if it 's any comfort to you , I may say what my experience has taught me . Women are queer , unreasoning creatures , and are just as likely as not to love a man who has been throwing away his affection . "
325001	325007	325009	325009	Roger	203	" Thank you , sir ! "
325014	325096	325009	325009	Roger	203	" I see you mean to give me encouragement . And I had resolved never to give Molly a hint of what I felt till I returned , and then to try and win her by every means in my power . I determined not to repeat the former scene in the former place , in your drawing - room , however I might be tempted . And perhaps , after all , she avoided me when she was here last . "
325097	325152	324470	324470	he	238	" Now , Roger , I 've listened to you long enough . If you 've nothing better to do with your time than to talk about my daughter , I have . When you come back it will be time enough to inquire how far your father would approve of such an engagement . "
325153	325176	325009	325009	Roger	203	" He himself urged it upon me the other day but then I was in despair I thought it was too late . "
325177	325253	324470	324470	he	238	" And what means you are likely to have of maintaining a wife ? I always thought that point was passed too lightly over when you formed your hurried engagement to Cynthia . I 'm not mercenary , Molly has some money independently of me , that she by the way knows nothing of , not much ; and I can allow her something . But all these things must be left till your return . "
325254	325261	325009	325009	Roger	203	" Then you sanction my attachment ? "
325262	325292	324470	324470	he	238	" I do n't know what you mean by sanctioning it . I ca n't help it . I suppose losing one 's daughter is a necessary evil . Still "
325301	325335	324470	324470	he	238	" it is but fair to you to say , I 'd rather give my child , my only child , remember ! to you , than to any man in the world ! "
325336	325340	325342	325342	Roger	203	" Thank you ! "
325358	325372	325355	325356	the latter	1251	" And I may see her , just once , before I go ? "
325373	325390	325009	325009	Roger	203	" Decidedly not . There I come in as doctor as well as father . No ! "
325391	325403	325355	325356	the latter	1251	" But you will take a message , at any rate ? "
325404	325432	325009	325009	Roger	203	" To my wife and to her conjointly . I will not separate them . I will not in the slightest way be a go - between . "
325433	325437	325439	325439	Roger	203	" Very well , "
325441	325480	325439	325439	Roger	203	" Tell them both as strongly as you can how I regret your prohibition . I see I must submit . But if I do n't come back , I 'll haunt you for having been so cruel . "
325481	325509	325009	325009	Roger	203	" Come , I like that . Give me a wise man of science in love ! No one beats him in folly . Good - by . "
325510	325522	325439	325439	Roger	203	" Good - by . You will see Molly this afternoon ! "
325523	325547	325009	325009	Roger	203	" To be sure . And you will see your father . But I do n't heave such portentous sighs at the thought . "
325648	325653	325655	325655	he	6623	" Lover versus father ! "
325660	325664	325655	325655	he	6623	" Lover wins . "
325838	325895	325820	325820	she	147	" Molly come here ! who is that man wrapped up in a cloak , there , near the Park wall , under the beech - tree he has been there this half - hour and more , never stirring , and looking at this house all the time ! I think it 's very suspicious . "
325926	325958	325918	325922	The next to come forwards	6627	" Why , mamma , it 's Roger Hamley ! Look now he 's kissing his hand ; he 's wishing us good - by in the only way he can ! "
326001	326010	326012	326013	Mrs. Gibson	189	" I call this so attentive of him , "
326027	326061	326012	326013	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Really , it is quite romantic . It reminds me of former days but he will be too late ! I must send him away ; it is half - past twelve ! "
326282	326337	326277	326278	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Upon my word , though Roger Hamley has never been a great favourite of mine , this little attention of his has reminded me very forcibly of a very charming young man a soupirant , as the French would call him Lieutenant Harper you must have heard me speak of him , Molly ? "
326338	326344	326346	326346	Molly	147	" I think I have ! "
326350	326503	326277	326278	Mrs. Gibson	189	" Well , you remember how devoted he was to me when I was at Mrs. Duncombe 's , my first situation , and I only seventeen . And when the recruiting party was ordered to another town , poor Mr. Harper came and stood opposite the schoolroom window for nearly an hour , and I know it was his doing that the band played ' The girl I left behind me , ' when they marched out the next day . Poor Mr. Harper ! It was before I knew dear Mr. Kirkpatrick ! Dear me . How often my poor heart has had to bleed in this life of mine ! not but what dear papa is a very worthy man , and makes me very happy . He would spoil me , indeed , if I would let him . Still he is not as rich as Mr. Henderson . "
326615	326622	326624	326624	she	189	" It is such a pity ! "
326626	326646	326624	326624	she	189	" that I was born when I was . I should so have liked to belong to this generation . "
326647	326655	326657	326657	he	1223	" That 's sometimes my own feeling , "
326659	326720	326657	326657	he	1223	" So many new views seem to be opened in science , that I should like , if it were possible , to live till their reality was ascertained , and one saw what they led to . But I do n't suppose that 's your reason , my dear , for wishing to be twenty or thirty years younger . "
326721	326873	326624	326624	she	189	" No , indeed . And I did not put it in that hard unpleasant way ; I only said I should like to belong to this generation . To tell the truth , I was thinking of Cynthia . Without vanity , I believe I was as pretty as she is when I was a girl , I mean ; I had not her dark eyelashes , but then my nose was straighter . And now look at the difference ! I have to live in a little country town with three servants , and no carriage ; and she with her inferior good looks will live in Sussex Place , and keep a man and a brougham , and I do n't know what . But the fact is , in this generation there are so many more rich young men than there were when I was a girl . "
326874	326908	326657	326657	he	1223	" Oh , ho ! so that 's your reason , is it , my dear ? If you had been young now you might have married somebody as well off as Walter ? "
326909	326912	326914	326914	she	6635	" Yes ! "
326916	326978	326914	326914	she	6635	" I think that was my idea . Of course I should have liked him to be you . I always think if you had gone to the bar you might have succeeded better , and lived in London , too . I do n't think Cynthia cares much where she lives , yet you see it has come to her . "
326979	326984	326657	326657	he	1223	" What has London ? "
326985	327087	326914	326914	she	6635	" Oh , you dear , facetious man . Now that 's just the thing to have captivated a jury . I do n't believe Walter will ever be so clever as you are . Yet he can take Cynthia to Paris , and abroad , and everywhere . I only hope all this indulgence wo n't develope the faults in Cynthia 's character . It 's a week since we heard from her , and I did write so particularly to ask her for the autumn fashions before I bought my new bonnet . But riches are a great snare . "
327088	327099	326657	326657	he	1223	" Be thankful you are spared temptation , my dear . "
327100	327130	326914	326914	she	6635	" No , I 'm not . Everybody likes to be tempted . And , after all , it 's very easy to resist temptation , if one wishes . "
327131	327140	326657	326657	he	1223	" I do n't find it so easy , "
327145	327154	327156	327156	Molly	147	" Here 's medicine for you , mamma , "
327168	327174	327156	327156	Molly	147	" A letter from Cynthia . "
327175	327348	327142	327143	her husband	1223	" Oh , you dear little messenger of good news ! There was one of the heathen deities in Mangnall 's Questions whose office it was to bring news . The letter is dated from Calais . They 're coming home ! She 's bought me a shawl and a bonnet ! The dear creature ! Always thinking of others before herself : good fortune can not spoil her . They 've a fortnight left of their holiday ! Their house is not quite ready ; they 're coming here . Oh , now , Mr. Gibson , we must have the new dinner - service at Watts 's I 've set my heart on so long ! ' Home ' Cynthia calls this house . I 'm sure it has been a home to her , poor darling ! I doubt if there is another man in the world who would have treated his step - daughter like dear papa ! And , Molly , you must have a new gown . "
327349	327362	327364	327365	Mr. Gibson	238	" Come , come ! Remember I belong to the last generation , "
327367	327377	327379	327379	Molly	147	" And Cynthia will not notice what I wear , "
327392	327474	327364	327365	Mr. Gibson	238	" No ! but Walter will . He has such a quick eye for dress , and I think I rival papa ; if he 's a good stepfather , I 'm a good stepmother , and I could not bear to see my Molly shabby , and not looking her best . I must have a new gown too . It wo n't do to look as if we had nothing but the dresses which we wore at the wedding ! "

And now , of course , I ca n't be so selfish as to get it for myself , and you to have nothing . You should learn to understand the wishes of other people . Still , on the whole , you are a dear , sweet girl , and I only wish well , I know what I wish ; only dear papa does not like it to be talked about . And now cover me up close , and let me go to sleep , and dream about my dear Cynthia and my new shawl ! "
