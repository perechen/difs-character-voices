1447	1499	1500	1500	She	278	" I can tell you nothing , Aunt Juley . I know no more than you do . We met - we only met the father and mother abroad last spring . I know so little that I did n't even know their son 's name . It 's all so - "
1509	1519	1502	1502	her	278	" In that case it is far too sudden . "
1520	1530	1502	1502	her	278	" Who knows , Aunt Juley , who knows ? "
1531	1559	1502	1502	her	278	" But , Margaret dear , I mean we must n't be unpractical now that we 've come to facts . It is too sudden , surely . "
1560	1564	1502	1502	her	278	" Who knows ! "
1565	1570	1502	1502	her	278	" But Margaret dear - "
1571	1580	1582	1582	Margaret	278	" I 'll go for her other letters , "
1584	1680	1582	1582	Margaret	278	" No , I wo n't , I 'll finish my breakfast . In fact , I have n't them . We met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer . Helen and I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer - the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors - you know - ' Speyer , Maintz , and Koln . ' Those three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street . "
1681	1693	1502	1502	her	278	" I still feel quite uneasy about this business , Margaret . "
1694	1903	1582	1582	Margaret	278	" The train crossed by a bridge of boats , and at first sight it looked quite fine . But oh , in five minutes we had seen the whole thing . The cathedral had been ruined , absolutely ruined , by restoration ; not an inch left of the original structure . We wasted a whole day , and came across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens . They too , poor things , had been taken in - they were actually stopping at Speyer - and they rather liked Helen insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg . As a matter of fact , they did come on next day . We all took some drives together . They knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and see them - at least , I was asked too , but Tibby 's illness prevented me , so last Monday she went alone . That 's all . You know as much as I do now . It 's a young man out the unknown . She was to have come back Saturday , but put off till Monday , perhaps on account of - I do n't know .
2127	2131	2132	2132	she	268	" The Germans , "
2135	2157	2132	2132	she	268	" are too thorough , and this is all very well sometimes , but at other times it does not do . "
2158	2161	2163	2163	Margaret	278	" Exactly , "
2165	2171	2163	2163	Margaret	278	" Germans are too thorough . "
2179	2189	2191	2192	Mrs. Munt	268	" Of course I regard you Schlegels as English , "
2195	2201	2191	2192	Mrs. Munt	268	" English to the backbone . "
2210	2220	2191	2192	Mrs. Munt	268	" And that reminds me - Helen 's letter - "
2221	2264	2279	2279	her	268	" Oh , yes , Aunt Juley , I am thinking all right about Helen 's letter . I know - I must go down and see her . I am thinking about her all right . I am meaning to go down "
2265	2272	2274	2275	Mrs. Munt	268	" But go with some plan , "
2287	2399	2274	2275	Mrs. Munt	268	" Margaret , if I may interfere , do n't be taken by surprise . What do you think of the Wilcoxes ? Are they our sort ? Are they likely people ? Could they appreciate Helen , who is to my mind a very special sort of person ? Do they care about Literature and Art ? That is most important when you come to think of it . Literature and Art . Most important . How old would the son be ? She says ' younger son . ' Would he be in a position to marry ? Is he likely to make Helen happy ? Did you gather - "
2400	2405	2279	2279	her	268	" I gathered nothing . "
2413	2419	2406	2406	They	655	" Then in that case - "
2420	2435	2274	2275	Mrs. Munt	268	" In that case I can make no plans , do n't you see . "
2436	2441	2406	2406	They	655	" On the contrary - "
2442	2459	2274	2275	Mrs. Munt	268	" I hate plans . I hate lines of action . Helen is n't a baby . "
2460	2473	2406	2406	They	655	" Then in that case , my dear , why go down ? "
2504	2523	2498	2498	She	278	" I love my dear sister ; I must be near her at this crisis of her life . "
2580	2587	2589	2590	Mrs. Munt	268	" I consider you odd girls , "
2592	2646	2647	2647	She	268	" and very wonderful girls , and in many ways far older than your years . But - you wo n't be offended ? - frankly I feel you are not up to this business . It requires an older person . Dear , I have nothing to call me back to Swanage . "
2654	2677	2647	2647	She	268	" I am all at your disposal . Let me go down to this house whose name I forget instead of you . "
2678	2681	2683	2683	she	268	" Aunt Juley "
2690	2717	2683	2683	she	268	" I must , must go to Howards End myself . You do n't exactly understand , though I can never thank you properly for offering . "
2718	2723	2725	2726	Mrs. Munt	268	" I do understand , "
2732	2803	2725	2726	Mrs. Munt	268	" I go down in no spirit of interference , but to make inquiries . Inquiries are necessary . Now , I am going to be rude . You would say the wrong thing ; to a certainty you would . In your anxiety for Helen 's happiness you would offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions - not that one minds offending them . "
2804	2875	2683	2683	she	268	" I shall ask no questions . I have it in Helen 's writing that she and a man are in love . There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that . All the rest is n't worth a straw . A long engagement if you like , but inquiries , questions , plans , lines of action - no , Aunt Juley , no . "
2923	2942	2683	2683	she	268	" If Helen had written the same to me about a shop - assistant or a penniless clerk - "
2943	2965	3022	3022	she	268	" Dear Margaret , do come into the library and shut the door . Your good maids are dusting the banisters . "
2966	2990	3022	3022	she	268	" - or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter Paterson , I should have said the same . "
3025	3049	3022	3022	she	268	" Though in the case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long engagement indeed , I must say . "
3050	3056	3058	3059	Mrs. Munt	268	" I should think so , "
3061	3136	3058	3059	Mrs. Munt	268	" and , indeed , I can scarcely follow you . Now , just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the Wilcoxes . I understand it , but most good people would think you mad . Imagine how disconcerting for Helen ! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly , slowly in this business , and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to . "
3143	3157	3022	3022	she	268	" But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off . "
3158	3168	3022	3022	she	268	" I think probably it must ; but slowly . "
3169	3178	3179	3179	Her	278	" Can you break an engagement off slowly ? "
3184	3239	3179	3179	Her	278	" What 's an engagement made of , do you suppose ? I think it 's made of some hard stuff , that may snap , but ca n't break . It is different to the other ties of life . They stretch or bend . They admit of degree . They 're different . "
3240	3294	3295	3295	Margaret	278	" Exactly so . But wo n't you let me just run down to Howards House , and save you all the discomfort ? I will really not interfere , but I do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me . "
3498	3515	3495	3495	she	278	" Yes , I have changed my mind ; I do wish that you would go . "
3555	3614	3626	3626	she	268	" You will remember , Aunt Juley , not to be drawn into discussing the engagement . Give my letter to Helen , and say whatever you feel yourself , but do keep clear of the relatives . We have scarcely got their names straight yet , and besides , that sort of thing is so uncivilized and wrong .
3615	3619	3621	3622	Mrs. Munt	268	" So uncivilized ? "
3636	3659	3626	3626	she	268	" Oh , I used an affected word . I only meant would you please only talk the thing over with Helen . "
3660	3665	3626	3626	she	268	" Only with Helen . "
3666	3669	3626	3626	she	268	" Because - "
4231	4241	4220	4220	Margaret	278	" No , they could manage much better alone . "
4283	4292	4294	4295	Mrs. Munt	268	" I must not interfere a third time , "
4366	4375	4376	4376	Margaret	278	" Then we should be together , dear . "
4429	4456	4418	4419	Mrs. Munt	268	" I did manage that , at all events . When the smash comes poor Margaret will have a nest - egg to fall back upon . "
5021	5027	5028	5028	she	268	" I want a house , "
5035	5049	5028	5028	she	268	" Its name is Howards Lodge . Do you know where it is ? "
5050	5054	5055	5056	the boy	753	" Mr. Wilcox ! "
5069	5076	5059	5065	A young man in front of them	754	" She 's wanting Howards End . "
5118	5134	5109	5109	she	268	" Excuse me asking , but are you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder ? "
5135	5146	5109	5109	she	268	" The younger . Can I do anything for you ? "
5147	5151	5153	5153	she	268	" Oh , well "
5159	5167	5153	5153	she	268	" Really . Are you ? I - "
5180	5203	5177	5177	her	268	" I am Miss Schlegels aunt . I ought to introduce myself , ought n't I ? My name is Mrs. Munt . "
5217	5236	5208	5208	he	752	" Oh , rather ; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us . Did you want to see her ? "
5237	5240	5204	5204	She	268	" Possibly - "
5241	5255	5256	5256	He	752	" I 'll call you a cab . No ; wait a mo - "
5259	5273	5256	5256	He	752	" Our motor 's here . I 'll run you up in it . "
5274	5280	5204	5204	She	268	" That is very kind - "
5281	5304	5256	5256	He	752	" Not at all , if you 'll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office . This way . "
5305	5316	5204	5204	She	268	" My niece is not with you by any chance ? "
5317	5354	5256	5256	He	752	" No ; I came over with my father . He has gone on north in your train . You 'll see Miss Schlegel at lunch . You 're coming up to lunch , I hope ? "
5355	5363	5365	5366	Mrs. Munt	268	" I should like to come UP , "
5453	5471	5440	5440	He	759	" In front or behind ? Which do you prefer ? It may be windy in front . "
5472	5484	5551	5551	he	759	" In front if I may ; then we can talk . "
5485	5504	5505	5505	He	759	" But excuse me one moment - I ca n't think what they 're doing with that parcel . "
5519	5548	5505	5505	He	759	" Hi ! hi , you there ! Are you going to keep me waiting all day ? Parcel for Wilcox , Howards End . Just look sharp ! "
5557	5586	5551	5551	he	759	" This station 's abominably organized ; if I had my way , the whole lot of 'em should get the sack . May I help you in ? "
5587	5595	5601	5601	she	268	" This is very good of you , "
5659	5664	5665	5665	she	268	" Very good indeed , "
5670	5680	5665	5665	she	268	" It is just what I should have wished . "
5681	5690	5691	5691	he	763	" Very good of you to say so , "
5714	5728	5709	5710	Mrs. Munt	268	" I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train . "
5729	5740	5665	5665	she	268	" You see , we heard from Helen this morning . "
5793	5804	5805	5805	he	763	" The mater will be very glad to see you , "
5808	5825	5805	5805	he	763	" Hi ! I say . Parcel for Howards End . Bring it out . Hi ! "
5855	5905	5826	5828	A bearded porter	765	" Sign , must I ? Why the - should I sign after all this bother ? Not even got a pencil on you ? Remember next time I report you to the station - master . My time 's of value , though yours may n't be . Here "
5912	5919	5826	5828	A bearded porter	765	" Extremely sorry , Mrs. Munt . "
5920	5928	6003	6003	Margaret	278	" Not at all , Mr. Wilcox . "
5929	5955	5826	5828	A bearded porter	765	" And do you object to going through the village ? It is rather a longer spin , but I have one or two commissions . "
5956	5977	6003	6003	Margaret	278	" I should love going through the village . Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with you . "
6019	6023	6003	6003	Margaret	278	" uncivilized or wrong "
6117	6123	6124	6124	she	278	" You can well imagine , "
6127	6138	6124	6124	she	278	" that the news was a great shock to us . "
6139	6143	6113	6113	she	278	" What news ? "
6144	6148	6149	6149	she	278	" Mr. Wilcox , "
6153	6169	6149	6149	she	278	" Margaret has told me everything - everything . I have seen Helen 's letter . "
6213	6224	6202	6202	he	769	" I beg your pardon ; I did n't catch . "
6225	6281	6204	6204	his	769	" About Helen . Helen , of course . Helen is a very exceptional person - I am sure you will let me say this , feeling towards her as you do - indeed , all the Schlegels are exceptional . I come in no spirit of interference , but it was a great shock . "
6369	6382	6384	6384	his	769	" I wonder when they 'll learn wisdom and tar the roads , "
6408	6435	6388	6389	a man	658	" Margaret could not come herself , on account of poor Tibby , so I am here to represent her and to have a good talk . "
6436	6445	6447	6449	the young man	769	" I 'm sorry to be so dense , "
6458	6467	6447	6449	the young man	769	" But I still have n't quite understood . "
6468	6479	6388	6389	a man	658	" Helen , Mr. Wilcox - my niece and you . "
6526	6532	6533	6533	he	769	" Miss Schlegel and myself . "
6540	6549	6551	6552	Mrs. Munt	268	" I trust there has been no misunderstanding , "
6554	6562	6551	6552	Mrs. Munt	268	" Her letter certainly read that way . "
6563	6567	6551	6552	Mrs. Munt	268	" What way ? "
6568	6574	6575	6575	She	786	" That you and she - "
6583	6591	6592	6592	he	769	" I think I catch your meaning , "
6596	6602	6592	6592	he	769	" What an extraordinary mistake ! "
6603	6611	6612	6612	she	786	" Then you did n't the least - "
6631	6643	6653	6653	he	769	" Scarcely , as I am already engaged to another lady . "
6661	6679	6653	6653	he	769	" Oh , good God ! Do n't tell me it 's some silliness of Paul 's . "
6680	6686	6655	6655	his	769	" But you are Paul . "
6687	6692	6653	6653	he	769	" I 'm not . "
6693	6704	6655	6655	his	769	" Then why did you say so at the station ? "
6705	6713	6653	6653	he	769	" I said nothing of the sort . "
6714	6723	6655	6655	his	769	" I beg your pardon , you did . "
6724	6739	6653	6653	he	769	" I beg your pardon , I did not . My name is Charles . "
6740	6742	6655	6655	his	769	" Younger "
6785	6795	6801	6801	his	792	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul - "
6832	6845	6808	6808	he	792	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece - "
6875	6887	6888	6888	she	791	" Yes , they care for one another very much indeed , "
6891	6912	6888	6888	she	791	" I dare say they will tell you about it by - and - by . We heard this morning . "
6921	6932	6916	6916	his	261	" The idiot , the idiot , the little fool ! "
6943	6958	6938	6938	herself	268	" If that is your attitude , Mr. Wilcox , I prefer to walk . "
6959	6994	6916	6916	his	261	" I beg you will do no such thing . I 'll take you up this moment to the house . Let me tell you the thing 's impossible , and must be stopped . "
7025	7075	7021	7021	she	268	" I quite agree , sir . The thing is impossible , and I will come up and stop it . My niece is a very exceptional person , and I am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her . "
7081	7104	7076	7076	Charles	261	" Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday , and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel - "
7105	7118	7078	7078	his	261	" Could you possibly lower your voice ? The shopman will overhear . "
7119	7123	7076	7076	Charles	261	" Esprit de classe "
7166	7170	7138	7138	She	268	" Right behind ? "
7171	7176	7178	7180	the lower orders	799	" Yes , sir . "
7188	7203	7138	7138	She	268	" I warn you : Paul has n't a penny ; it 's useless . "
7204	7250	7138	7138	She	268	" No need to warn us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . The warning is all the other way . My niece has been very foolish , and I shall give her a good scolding and take her back to London with me . "
7251	7321	7138	7138	She	268	" He has to make his way out in Nigeria . He could n't think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate , and is in other ways - Why has n't he told us ? Of course he 's ashamed . He knows he 's been a fool . And so he has - a damned fool . "
7326	7339	7322	7322	She	800	" Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news . "
7340	7397	7460	7460	She	803	" If I were a man , Mr. Wilcox , for that last remark I 'd box your ears . You 're not fit to clean my niece 's boots , to sit in the same room with her , and you dare - you actually dare - I decline to argue with such a person . "
7398	7422	7322	7322	She	800	" All I know is , she 's spread the thing and he has n't , and my father 's away and I - "
7423	7431	7460	7460	She	803	" And all that I know is - "
7432	7441	7322	7322	She	800	" Might I finish my sentence , please ? "
7442	7445	7460	7460	She	803	" No . "
7596	7626	7583	7583	Helen	268	" Aunt Juley , I have just had a telegram from Margaret ; I - I meant to stop your coming . It is n't - it 's over . "
7641	7672	7636	7636	She	268	" Aunt Juley dear , do n't . Do n't let them know I 've been so silly . It was n't anything . Do bear up for my sake . "
7673	7676	7678	7679	Charles Wilcox	261	" Paul , "
7686	7699	7636	7636	She	268	" Do n't let them know . They are never to know . "
7700	7707	7636	7636	She	268	" Oh , my darling Helen - "
7708	7713	7636	7636	She	268	" Paul ! Paul ! "
7724	7734	7714	7717	A very young man	811	" Paul , is there any truth in this ? "
7735	7744	7636	7636	She	268	" I did n't - I do n't - "
7745	7765	7714	7717	A very young man	811	" Yes or no , man ; plain question , plain answer . Did or did n't Miss Schlegel - "
7766	7770	7636	7636	She	268	" Charles dear , "
7778	7797	7636	7636	She	268	" Charles , dear Charles , one does n't ask plain questions . There are n't such things . "
7940	7957	7936	7937	her ancestors	821	" Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most . The rest can wait . "
7987	8037	7984	7984	She	528	" Miss Schlegel , would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room , whichever you think best . Paul , do find Evie , and tell her lunch for six , but I 'm not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it . "
8081	8084	8085	8085	he	825	" Mother , "

8102	8117	8085	8085	he	825	" It 's all right , dear . They have broken off the engagement . "
8118	8122	8085	8085	he	825	" Engagement - ! "
8123	8139	8141	8142	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" They do not love any longer , if you prefer it put that way , "
8226	8236	8222	8222	she	268	" Thank goodness , poor Margaret is saved this ! "
8246	8256	8222	8222	she	268	" It had to be gone through by someone , "
8267	8284	8222	8222	she	268	" The one time I really did help Emily 's girls was over the Wilcox business . "
8547	8561	8544	8544	Charles	261	" Why be so polite to servants ? they do n't understand it , "
8571	8582	8562	8562	she	268	" If they do n't understand it , I do . "
8598	8606	8607	8607	she	268	" I am swathed in ca nt , "
8610	8623	8607	8607	she	268	" and it is good for me to be stripped of it . "
8837	8855	8833	8833	him	259	" This girl would let you kiss her ; you might not have such a chance again . "
8858	8863	8833	8833	him	259	" how it happened , "

9119	9123	9116	9116	he	859	" I love you "
9161	9165	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" I understand , "
9169	9195	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" at least , I understand as much as ever is understood of these things . Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning . "
9196	9203	9116	9116	he	859	" It was over at once . "
9204	9209	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" How , Helen ? "
9210	9266	9116	9116	he	859	" I was still happy while I dressed , but as I came downstairs I got nervous , and when I went into the dining - room I knew it was no good . There was Evie - I ca n't explain - managing the tea - urn , and Mr. Wilcox reading the TIMES . "
9267	9272	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" Was Paul there ? "
9273	9292	9116	9116	he	859	" Yes ; and Charles was talking to him about Stocks and Shares , and he looked frightened . "
9323	9432	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" Somehow , when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful . It is all right for us to be frightened , or for men of another sort - father , for instance ; but for men like that ! When I saw all the others so placid , and Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing , I felt for a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud , just a wall of newspapers and motor - cars and golf - clubs , and that if it fell I should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness . "
9433	9453	9116	9116	he	859	" I do n't think that . The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people , particularly the wife . "
9454	9839	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" No , I do n't really think that . But Paul was so broad - shouldered ; all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse , and I knew that it would never do - never . I said to him after breakfast , when the others were practising strokes , ' We rather lost our heads , ' and he looked better at once , though frightfully ashamed . He began a speech about having no money to marry on , but it hurt him to make it , and I - stopped him . Then he said , ' I must beg your pardon over this , Miss Schlegel ; I ca n't think what came over me last night . ' And I said , ' Nor what over me ; never mind . ' And then we parted - at least , until I remembered that I had written straight off to tell you the night before , and that frightened him again . I asked him to send a telegram for me , for he knew you would be coming or something ; and he tried to get hold of the motor , but Charles and Mr. Wilcox wanted it to go to the station ; and Charles offered to send the telegram for me , and then I had to say that the telegram was of no consequence , for Paul said Charles might read it , and though I wrote it out several times , he always said people would suspect something . He took it himself at last , pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges , and , what with one thing and the other , it was not handed in at the Post Office until too late . It was the most terrible morning . Paul disliked me more and more , and Evie talked cricket averages till I nearly screamed . I can not think how I stood her all the other days . At last Charles and his father started for the station , and then came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that train , and Paul - oh , rather horrible - said that I had muddled it . But Mrs. Wilcox knew . "
9840	9844	9960	9960	Helen	268	" Knew what ? "
9845	9867	9167	9167	Margaret	278	" Everything ; though we neither of us told her a word , and had known all along , I think . "
9868	9877	9960	9960	Helen	268	" Oh , she must have overheard you . "
9878	9928	9929	9929	She	865	" I suppose so , but it seemed wonderful . When Charles and Aunt Juley drove up , calling each other names , Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible . Ugh ! but it has been a disgusting business . To think that - "
9932	9956	9958	9958	Margaret	278	" To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment , there must be all these telegrams and anger , "
9963	10082	9960	9960	Helen	268	" I 've often thought about it , Helen . It 's one of the most interesting things in the world . The truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never touched - a life in which telegrams and anger count . Personal relations , that we think supreme , are not supreme there . There love means marriage settlements , death , death duties . So far I 'm clear . But here my difficulty . This outer life , though obviously horrid , often seems the real one - there 's grit in it . It does breed character . Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end ? "
10083	10117	9960	9960	Helen	268	" Oh , Meg , that 's what I felt , only not so clearly , when the Wilcoxes were so competent , and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes . "
10118	10126	9960	9960	Helen	268	" Do n't you feel it now ? "
10127	10134	10136	10136	Helen	268	" I remember Paul at breakfast , "
10139	10168	10136	10136	Helen	268	" I shall never forget him . He had nothing to fall back upon . I know that personal relations are the real life , for ever and ever .
10169	10172	10200	10200	Helen	268	" Amen ! "

10763	10776	10778	10782	a haughty and magnificent nephew	905	" Do you imply that we Germans are stupid , Uncle Ernst ? "
10788	10811	10784	10785	Uncle Ernst	288	" To my mind . You use the intellect , but you no longer care about it . That I call stupidity . "
10823	10864	10820	10820	he	288	" You only care about the ' things that you can use , and therefore arrange them in the following order : Money , supremely useful ; intellect , rather useful ; imagination , of no use at all . No "
10872	11053	10820	10820	he	288	" your Pan - Germanism is no more imaginative than is our Imperialism over here . It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness , to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile , and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven . That is not imagination . No , it kills it . When their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once , and naturally . Your poets too are dying , your philosophers , your musicians , to whom Europe has listened for two hundred years . Gone . Gone with the little courts that nurtured them - gone with Esterhaz and Weimar . What ? What 's that ? Your Universities ? Oh , yes , you have learned men , who collect more facts than do the learned men of England . They collect facts , and facts , and empires of facts . But which of them will rekindle the light within ? "

13585	13598	13600	13601	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" For my part , I have heard the composition at Stettin , "
13603	13615	13600	13601	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" On two occasions . It is dramatic , a little . "

14067	14071	14064	14064	he	763	" Thank you , "
14160	14168	14169	14169	she	278	" How tired one gets after music ! "
14172	14184	14169	14169	she	278	" Do you find the atmosphere of Queen 's Hall oppressive ? "
14185	14190	14169	14169	she	278	" Yes , horribly . "
14191	14204	14169	14169	she	278	" But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive . "
14205	14212	14169	14169	she	278	" Do you go there much ? "
14213	14229	14169	14169	she	278	" When my work permits , I attend the gallery for , the Royal Opera . "
14235	14244	14230	14230	Helen	268	" So do I. I love the gallery , "

14343	14345	14315	14315	she	278	" Tannhoyser "
14391	14461	14379	14380	Mrs. Munt	268	" I do in a WAY remember the passage , Tibby , but when every instrument is so beautiful , it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another . I am sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts . Not a dull note from beginning to end . I only wish that our German friends would have stayed till it finished . "
14462	14481	14483	14483	Tibby	262	" But surely you have n't forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low C , Aunt Juley ? "
14487	14496	14483	14483	Tibby	262	" No one could . It 's unmistakable . "
14497	14503	14505	14506	Mrs. Munt	268	" A specially loud part ? "
14508	14520	14521	14521	she	268	" Of course I do not go in for being musical , "
14528	14682	14521	14521	she	268	" I only care for music - a very different thing . But still I will say this for myself - I do know when I like a thing and when I do n't . Some people are the same about pictures . They can go into a picture gallery - Miss Conder can - and say straight off what they feel , all round the wall . I never could do that . But music is so different to pictures , to my mind . When it comes to music I am as safe as houses , and I assure you , Tibby , I am by no means pleased by everything . There was a thing - something about a faun in French - which Helen went into ecstasies over , but I thought it most tinkling and superficial , and said so , and I held to my opinion too . "
14683	14688	14690	14690	Margaret	278	" Do you agree ? "
14692	14703	14690	14690	Margaret	278	" Do you think music is so different to pictures ? "
14704	14716	14717	14717	he	1021	" I - I should have thought so , kind of , "
14720	14754	14690	14690	Margaret	278	" So should I. Now , my sister declares they 're just the same . We have great arguments over it . She says I 'm dense ; I say she 's sloppy . "
14762	14883	14759	14759	she	278	" Now , does n't it seem absurd to you ? What is the good of the Arts if they are interchangeable ? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye ? Helen 's one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting , and pictures into the language of music . It 's very ingenious , and she says several pretty things in the process , but what 's gained , I 'd like to know ? Oh , it 's all rubbish , radically false . If Monet 's really Debussy , and Debussy 's really Monet , neither gentleman is worth his salt - that 's my opinion .
14889	14984	14690	14690	Margaret	278	" Now , this very symphony that we 've just been having - she wo n't let it alone . She labels it with meanings from start to finish ; turns it into literature . I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music . Yet I do n't know . There 's my brother - behind us . He treats music as music , and oh , my goodness ! He makes me angrier than anyone , simply furious . With him I dare n't even argue . "
14992	15123	15124	15124	Her	1024	" But , of course , the real villain is Wagner . He has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of arts . I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now , though extraordinarily interesting . Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses , like Wagner , who stir up all the wells of thought at once . For a moment it 's splendid . Such a splash as never was . But afterwards - such a lot of mud ; and the wells - as it were , they communicate with each other too easily now , and not one of them will run quite clear . That 's what Wagner 's done . "
15258	15261	15243	15243	he	769	" tell , "
15297	15307	15308	15308	he	769	" I suppose my umbrella will be all right , "
15312	15337	15308	15308	he	769	" I do n't really mind about it . I will think about music instead . I suppose my umbrella will be all right . "
15365	15375	15361	15361	he	769	" Shall I try to do without a programme ? "
15428	15442	15445	15445	she	278	" Do n't you think so ? do n't you feel the same ? "
15450	15457	15445	15445	she	278	" Oh , do interrupt me ! "
15536	15550	15531	15531	she	278	" I do hope that you 'll come in and have some tea . "
15551	15582	15531	15531	she	278	" I do hope that you 'll come in and have some tea . We should be so glad . I have dragged you so far out of your way . "
15682	15689	15668	15668	she	278	" Helen ! Let us in ! "
15690	15694	15784	15784	Helen	268	" All right , "
15699	15709	15668	15668	she	278	" You 've been taking this gentleman 's umbrella . "
15710	15715	15717	15717	Helen	268	" Taken a what ? "
15723	15739	15717	15717	Helen	268	" Oh , what 's that ? Do come in ! How do you do ? "
15740	15773	15668	15668	she	278	" Helen , you must not be so ramshackly . You took this gentleman 's umbrella away from Queen 's Hall , and he has had the trouble of coming for it . "
15774	15782	15784	15784	Helen	268	" Oh , I am so sorry ! "
15815	15857	15791	15791	She	268	" I do nothing but steal umbrellas . I am so very sorry ! Do come in and choose one . Is yours a hooky or a nobbly ? Mine 's a nobbly - at least , I THINK it is . "
15889	15988	15989	15989	She	268	" Do n't you talk , Meg ! You stole an old gentleman 's silk top - hat . Yes , she did , Aunt Juley . It is a positive fact . She thought it was a muff . Oh , heavens ! I 've knocked the In and Out card down . Where 's Frieda ? Tibby , why do n't you ever - No , I ca n't remember what I was going to say . That was n't it , but do tell the maids to hurry tea up . What about this umbrella ? "
15993	16015	15989	15989	She	268	" No , it 's all gone along the seams . It 's an appalling umbrella . It must be mine . "
16046	16053	16055	16055	Margaret	278	" But if you will stop - "
16057	16068	16055	16055	Margaret	278	" Now , Helen , how stupid you 've been ! "
16069	16075	16043	16044	the clerk	1041	" Whatever have I done ? "
16076	16129	16055	16055	Margaret	278	" Do n't you see that you 've frightened him away ? I meant him to stop to tea . You ought n't to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella . I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable . No , it 's not a bit of good now . "
16141	16147	16131	16131	Helen	268	" Oh , do stop ! "
16148	16159	16161	16162	Mrs. Munt	268	" I dare say it is all for the best , "
16164	16188	16161	16162	Mrs. Munt	268	" We know nothing about the young man , Margaret , and your drawing - room is full of very tempting little things . "
16193	16246	16190	16190	Helen	268	" Aunt Juley , how can you ! You make me more and more ashamed . I 'd rather he HAD been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that I - Well , I must shut the front - door , I suppose . One more failure for Helen . "
16247	16261	16263	16263	Margaret	278	" Yes , I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent , "
16276	16360	16273	16273	she	278	" You remember ' rent . ' It was one of father 's words - Rent to the ideal , to his own faith in human nature . You remember how he would trust strangers , and if they fooled him he would say , ' It 's better to be fooled than to be suspicious ' - that the confidence trick is the work of man , but the want - of - confidence - trick is the work of the devil . "
16361	16370	16372	16373	Mrs. Munt	268	" I remember something of the sort now , "
16384	16397	16372	16373	Mrs. Munt	268	" It was lucky that your father married a wife with money . "
16409	16423	16404	16404	she	278	" Why , he might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well . "
16424	16430	16432	16432	Helen	268	" Better that he had , "
16435	16444	16446	16446	Margaret	278	" No , I agree with Aunt Juley , "
16448	16464	16446	16446	Margaret	278	" I 'd rather mistrust people than lose my little Ricketts . There are limits . "
16538	16545	16547	16547	Helen	268	" All right , Auntie Tibby , "
16557	16590	16550	16550	Margaret	278	" In a way , I wish we had a real boy in the house - the kind of boy who cares for men . It would make entertaining so much easier . "
16591	16596	16598	16599	her sister	566	" So do I , "
16601	16611	16598	16599	her sister	566	" Tibby only cares for cultured females singing Brahms . "
16622	16669	16617	16617	she	278	" Why did n't you make that young man welcome , Tibby ? You must do the host a little , you know . You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping , instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women . "
16684	16700	16617	16617	she	278	" Oh , it 's no good looking superior . I mean what I say . "
16701	16706	16708	16708	Margaret	278	" Leave Tibby alone ! "
16720	16731	16733	16733	Helen	268	" Here 's the house a regular hen - coop ! "
16735	16741	16743	16744	Mrs. Munt	268	" Oh , my dear ! "
16746	16779	16743	16744	Mrs. Munt	268	" How can you say such dreadful things ! The number of men you get here has always astonished me . If there is any danger it 's the other way round . "
16780	16795	16862	16862	Helen	268	" Yes , but it 's the wrong sort of men , Helen means . "
16796	16803	16805	16805	Helen	268	" No , I do n't , "
16807	16850	16805	16805	Helen	268	" We get the right sort of man , but the wrong side of him , and I say that 's Tibby 's fault . There ought to be a something about the house - an - I do n't know what . "
16851	16861	16862	16862	Helen	268	" A touch of the W. 's , perhaps ? "
16868	16875	16877	16877	Tibby	262	" Who are the W. 's ? "
16879	16901	16862	16862	Helen	268	" The W. 's are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you do n't , so there ! "
16902	16912	16914	16914	Margaret	278	" I suppose that ours is a female house , "
16916	17108	16914	16914	Margaret	278	" and one must just accept it . No , Aunt Juley , I do n't mean that this house is full of women . I am trying to say something much more clever . I mean that it was irrevocably feminine , even in father 's time . Now I 'm sure you understand ! Well , I 'll give you another example . It 'll shock you , but I do n't care . Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner - party , and that the guests had been Leighton , Millais , Swinburne , Rossetti , Meredith , Fitzgerald , etc . Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic ? Heavens no ! The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that . So with our house - it must be feminine , and all we can do is to see that it is n't effeminate . Just as another house that I can mention , but I wo n't , sounded irrevocably masculine , and all its inmates can do is to see that it is n't brutal . "
17109	17121	17123	17123	Tibby	262	" That house being the W. 's house , I presume , "
17125	17141	17142	17142	Helen	268	" You 're not going to be told about the W. 's , my child , "
17190	17190	17123	17123	Tibby	262	"
17191	17201	17203	17203	Margaret	278	" You do what you can for the house , "
17205	17214	17203	17203	Margaret	278	" The drawing - room reeks of smoke . "
17215	17273	17123	17123	Tibby	262	" If you smoked too , the house might suddenly turn masculine . Atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go . Even at Queen Victoria 's dinner - party - if something had been just a little different - perhaps if she 'd worn a clinging Liberty tea - gown instead of a magenta satin - "
17274	17283	17203	17203	Margaret	278	" With an Indian shawl over her shoulders - "
17284	17295	17123	17123	Tibby	262	" Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm - pin - "
17319	17333	17315	17315	Margaret	278	" How inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art . "
17408	17457	17464	17466	the three women	1056	" That reminds me , Margaret . We might have taken that young man into the dining - room , at all events . Only the majolica plate - and that is so firmly set in the wall . I am really distressed that he had no tea . "
17778	17796	17799	17799	he	753	" All men are equal - all men , that is to say , who possess umbrellas , "
17959	17965	17982	17983	Mr. Dealtry	320	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
17966	17972	17982	17983	Mr. Dealtry	320	" Evening , Mr. Dealtry . "
17973	17977	17982	17983	Mr. Dealtry	320	" Nice evening . "
17978	17981	17982	17983	Mr. Dealtry	320	" Evening . "
18325	18331	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
18332	18338	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" Evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18339	18353	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester . "
18354	18360	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" I beg your pardon ? "
18361	18375	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester , "
18398	18403	18405	18405	Leonard	317	" Ah , yes , "
18423	18441	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be stationary in 1960 . "
18442	18449	18481	18481	Leonard	317	" You do n't say so . "
18450	18461	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" I call it a very serious thing , eh ? "
18462	18470	18481	18481	Leonard	317	" Good - evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18471	18479	18377	18378	Mr. Cunningham	321	" Good - evening , Mr. Bast . "
18526	18529	18519	18519	He	317	" Hullo ! "
18544	18547	18548	18548	he	317	" Hullo ! "
18989	18996	18997	18997	he	317	" Damn , damn , damnation ! "
19024	19031	19014	19014	he	317	" Oh , damn it all - "
19091	19100	19069	19069	he	317	" Seven miles to the north of Venice - "
19129	19186	19118	19120	The rich man	1124	" Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low - water mark attain by degrees a higher level , and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass , raised here and there into shapeless mounds , and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea . "
19220	19256	19209	19209	He	317	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first for of the shafts enough has been said already , what is very peculiar to this church - its luminousness . "
19305	19343	19280	19280	he	317	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already , what is very peculiar to this flat - its obscurity . "
19370	19380	19389	19393	the voice in the gondola	1129	" My flat is dark as well as stuffy . "
19569	19573	19521	19521	He	317	" bit of luck "
19583	19653	19654	19654	Leonard	317	" If only I had a bit of luck , the whole thing would come straight . . . . He 's got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20 h.-p . Fiat , but then , mind you , he 's had luck . . . . I 'm sorry the wife 's so late , but she never has any luck over catching trains . "
20033	20037	20039	20039	Leonard	317	" What ho ! "
20064	20068	20056	20056	Jacky	325	" What ho ! "
20069	20073	20074	20074	he	317	" Been out ? "
20095	20098	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" No , "
20101	20109	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Oh , I am so tired . "
20110	20114	20056	20056	Jacky	325	" You tired ? "
20115	20118	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Eh ? "
20119	20124	20126	20126	he	317	" I 'm tired , "
20133	20143	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Oh , Len , I am so tired . "
20144	20157	20159	20159	Leonard	317	" I 've been to that classical concert I told you about , "
20161	20166	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" What 's that ? "
20167	20178	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" I came back as soon as it was over . "
20179	20188	20190	20190	Jacky	325	" Any one been round to our place ? "
20192	20212	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Not that I 've seen . I met Mr. Cunningham outside , and we passed a few remarks . "
20213	20220	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" What , not Mr. Cunnginham ? "
20221	20224	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Yes . "
20225	20233	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Oh , you mean Mr. Cunningham . "
20234	20240	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" Yes . Mr. Cunningham . "
20241	20254	20091	20092	the lady	1142	" I 've been out to tea at a lady friend 's . "
20322	20341	20319	20319	she	1143	" On the shelf , On the shelf , Boys , boys , I 'm on the shelf , "
20419	20428	20416	20416	she	1143	" Is that a book you 're reading ? "
20433	20439	20416	20416	she	1143	" That 's a book , "
20465	20468	20462	20462	he	317	" Bookmarker . "
20469	20472	20462	20462	he	317	" Len - "
20473	20478	20479	20479	he	317	" What is it ? "
20501	20507	20462	20462	he	317	" You do love me ? "
20508	20524	20462	20462	he	317	" Jacky , you know that I do . How can you ask such questions ! "
20525	20538	20462	20462	he	317	" But you do love me , Len , do n't you ? "
20539	20545	20462	20462	he	317	" Of course I do . "
20556	20559	20462	20462	he	317	" Len - "
20560	20567	20462	20462	he	317	" Well ? What is it ? "
20568	20578	20462	20462	he	317	" Len , you will make it all right ? "
20579	20590	20592	20593	the boy	753	" I ca n't have you ask me that again , "
20602	20714	20592	20593	the boy	753	" I 've promised to marry you when I 'm of age , and that 's enough . My word 's my word . I 've promised to marry you as soon as ever I 'm twenty - one , and I ca n't keep on being worried . I 've worries enough . It is n't likely I 'd throw you over , let alone my word , when I 've spent all this money . Besides , I 'm an Englishman , and I never go back on my word . Jacky , do be reasonable . Of course I 'll marry you . Only do stop badgering me . "
20715	20723	20462	20462	he	317	" When 's your birthday , Len ? "
20724	20755	20592	20593	the boy	753	" I 've told you again and again , the eleventh of November next . Now get off my knee a bit ; someone must get supper , I suppose . "
20841	20933	20934	20934	He	317	" It really is too bad when a fellow is n't trusted . It makes one feel so wild , when I 've pretended to the people here that you 're my wife - all right , you shall be my wife - and I 've bought you the ring to wear , and I 've taken this flat furnished , and it 's far more than I can afford , and yet you are n't content , and I 've also not told the truth when I 've written home . "
20939	20945	20936	20936	his	317	" He 'd stop it . "
20961	20976	20958	20958	he	317	" My brother'd stop it . I 'm going against the whole world , Jacky .
20977	21051	20936	20936	his	317	" That 's what I am , Jacky . I do n't take any heed of what anyone says . I just go straight forward , I do . That 's always been my way . I 'm not one of your weak knock - kneed chaps . If a woman 's in trouble , I do n't leave her in the lurch . That 's not my street . No , thank you .
21052	21132	20958	20958	he	317	" I 'll tell you another thing too . I care a good deal about improving myself by means of Literature and Art , and so getting a wider outlook . For instance , when you came in I was reading Ruskin 's STONES OF VENICE . I do n't say this to boast , but just to show you the kind of man I am . I can tell you , I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon . "
21159	21170	21151	21151	she	1155	" But you do love me , do n't you ? "
21303	21305	21299	21299	She	1155	" likeness "

21423	21442	21416	21416	she	1155	" No ; I 'll play you something lovely . Get up , dear , for a minute . "
21669	21672	21717	21717	she	1172	" Len ? "
21673	21678	21679	21679	he	317	" You in bed ? "
21686	21689	21717	21717	she	1172	" M'm . "
21690	21694	21717	21717	she	1172	" All right . "
21701	21712	21713	21713	he	317	" I must clean my boots ready for the morning , "
21722	21732	21717	21717	she	1172	" I rather want to get this chapter done . "
21733	21736	21717	21717	she	1172	" What ? "
21744	21749	21717	21717	she	1172	" What 's that ? "
21750	21764	21782	21782	she	1172	" All right , Jacky , nothing ; I 'm reading a book . "
21765	21768	21717	21717	she	1172	" What ? "
21769	21772	21773	21773	he	317	" What ? "
21848	21853	21855	21856	her aunt	635	" Oh , Margaret , "
21876	21876	21869	21869	I	0	"
21904	21920	21900	21902	the Wilcox family	1179	" coming up , no doubt , in the hope of getting into London society . "
22059	22076	22037	22037	She	268	" What ! a hundred and twenty for a basement ? You 'll never get it ! "
22082	22090	22078	22078	they	1185	" One can but try , madam . "
22159	22172	22173	22173	she	278	" Oh , but Helen is n't a girl with no interests , "
22176	22217	22173	22173	she	278	" She has plenty of other things and other people to think about . She made a false start with the Wilcoxes , and she 'll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them . "
22218	22268	22538	22539	Mrs. Munt	268	" For a clever girl , dear , how very oddly you do talk . Helen'll HAVE to have something more to do with them , now that they 're all opposite . She may meet that Paul in the street . She can not very well not bow . "
22269	22402	22173	22173	she	278	" Of course she must bow . But look here ; let 's do the flowers . I was going to say , the will to be interested in him has died , and what else matters ? I look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in Helen . It 's dead , and she 'll never be troubled with it again . The only things that matter are the things that interest one . Bowing , even calling and leaving cards , even a dinner - party - we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes , if they find it agreeable ; but the other thing , the one important thing - never again . Do n't you see ? "
22433	22500	22173	22173	she	278	" I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with us . I did n't tell you at the time - it might have made you angry , and you had enough to worry you - but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W. , and apologized for the trouble that Helen had given them . She did n't answer it . "
22501	22506	22538	22539	Mrs. Munt	268	" How very rude ! "
22507	22516	22173	22173	she	278	" I wonder . Or was it sensible ? "
22517	22525	22538	22539	Mrs. Munt	268	" No , Margaret , most rude . "
22526	22537	22173	22173	she	278	" In either case one can class it as reassuring . "
22636	22647	22648	22648	she	268	" But you will be careful , wo n't you ? "
22651	22659	22648	22648	she	268	" Oh , certainly . Fiendishly careful . "
22660	22669	22648	22648	she	268	" And Helen must be careful , too , "
22670	22675	22677	22677	Helen	268	" Careful over what ? "
22690	22693	22695	22695	Margaret	278	" Nothing , "
22703	22711	22648	22648	she	268	" Careful over what , Aunt Juley ? "
22719	22765	22712	22713	Mrs. Munt	268	" It is only that a certain family , whom we know by name but do not mention , as you said yourself last night after the concert , have taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons - where the plants are in the balcony . "
22789	22804	22786	22786	she	268	" What , Helen , you do n't mind them coming , do you ? "
22812	22820	22822	22822	Helen	268	" Of course I do n't mind , "
22827	22853	22822	22822	Helen	268	" It is that you and Meg are both so absurdly grave about it , when there 's nothing to be grave about at all . "
22854	22860	22862	22862	Margaret	278	" I 'm not grave , "
22871	22884	22868	22868	her	278	" Well , you look grave ; does n't she , Frieda ? "
22885	22908	22868	22868	her	278	" I do n't feel grave , that 's all I can say ; you 're going quite on the wrong tack . "
22909	22918	22920	22921	Mrs. Munt	268	" No , she does not feel grave , "
22923	22934	22920	22921	Mrs. Munt	268	" I can bear witness to that . She disagrees - "
22935	22938	22940	22941	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Hark ! "
22943	22951	22940	22941	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" I hear Bruno entering the hall . "
23047	23079	23039	23039	she	268	" Did you say the Mathesons ' flat , Aunt Juley ? How wonderful you are ! I never knew that the woman who laced too tightly 's name was Matheson . "
23080	23085	23039	23039	she	268	" Come , Helen , "
23090	23095	23039	23039	she	268	" Go , Helen , "
23110	23121	23039	23039	she	268	" Helen can not deceive me , She does mind . "
23122	23127	23129	23129	Margaret	278	" Oh , hush ! "
23131	23143	23129	23129	Margaret	278	" Frieda'll hear you , and she can be so tiresome . "
23144	23148	23150	23151	Mrs. Munt	268	" She minds , "
23169	23308	23150	23151	Mrs. Munt	268	" I knew she 'd mind - and I 'm sure a girl ought to ! Such an experience ! Such awful coarse - grained people ! I know more about them than you do , which you forget , and if Charles had taken you that motor drive - well , you 'd have reached the house a perfect wreck . Oh , Margaret , you do n't know what you are in for . They 're all bottled up against the drawing - room window . There 's Mrs. Wilcox - I 've seen her . There 's Paul . There 's Evie , who is a minx . There 's Charles - I saw him to start with . And who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper - coloured face be ? "
23309	23315	23397	23397	her	268	" Mr. Wilcox , possibly . "
23316	23327	23150	23151	Mrs. Munt	268	" I knew it . And there 's Mr. Wilcox . "
23328	23340	23342	23342	Margaret	278	" It 's a shame to call his face copper colour , "
23344	23358	23342	23342	Margaret	278	" He has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age . "
23399	23429	23393	23393	Margaret	278	" Helen did not take the news quite as I expected , but the Wilcox nerve is dead in her really , so there 's no need for plans . "
23430	23439	23397	23397	her	268	" It 's as well to be prepared . "
23440	23452	23393	23393	Margaret	278	" No - it 's as well not to be prepared . "
23453	23456	23397	23397	her	268	" Because - '
23536	23544	23546	23546	her	278	" Because I 'd sooner risk it , "
23550	23556	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" But imagine the evenings , "
23574	23676	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Turn the electric light on her or there , and it 's almost the same room . One evening they may forget to draw their blinds down , and you 'll see them ; and the next , you yours , and they 'll see you . Impossible to sit out on the balconies . Impossible to water the plants , or even speak . Imagine going out of the front - door , and they come out opposite at the same moment . And yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary , and you 'd rather risk it . "
23677	23687	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" I hope to risk things all my life . "
23688	23696	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Oh , Margaret , most dangerous . "
23697	23702	23703	23703	she	635	" But after all , "
23709	23723	23703	23703	she	635	" there 's never any great risk as long as you have money . "
23724	23734	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Oh , shame ! What a shocking speech ! "
23735	23743	23745	23746	Miss Schlegel	278	" Money pads the edges of things , "
23748	23756	23745	23746	Miss Schlegel	278	" God help those who have none . "
23757	23765	23767	23768	Mrs. Munt	268	" But this is something quite new ! "
23790	23895	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" New for me ; sensible people have acknowledged it for years . You and I and the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands . It is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence . It 's only when we see someone near us tottering that we realize all that an independent income means . Last night , when we were talking up here round the fire , I began to think that the very soul of the world is economic , and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love , but the absence of coin . "
23896	23903	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" I call that rather cynical . "
23904	24010	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" So do I. But Helen and I , we ought to remember , when we are tempted to criticize others , that we are standing on these islands , and that most of the others , are down below the surface of the sea . The poor can not always reach those whom they want to love , and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer . We rich can . Imagine the tragedy last June , if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor people , and could n't invoke railways and motor - cars to part them . "
24011	24018	24020	24021	Mrs. Munt	268	" That 's more like Socialism , "
24024	24190	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Call it what you like . I call it going through life with one 's hand spread open on the table . I 'm tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor , and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves . I stand each year upon six hundred pounds , and Helen upon the same , and Tibby will stand upon eight , and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed - from the sea , yes , from the sea . And all our thoughts are the thoughts of six - hundred - pounders , and all our speeches ; and because we do n't want to steal umbrellas ourselves , we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them , and do steal them sometimes , and that what 's a joke up here is down there reality - "
24191	24214	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" There they go - there goes Fraulein Mosebach . Really , for a German she does dress charmingly . Oh - ! "
24215	24220	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" What is it ? "
24221	24232	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes ' flat . "
24233	24239	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Why should n't she ? "
24240	24259	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" I beg your pardon , I interrupted you . What was it you were saying about reality ? "
24260	24271	24273	24273	Margaret	278	" I had worked round to myself , as usual , "
24281	24301	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Do tell me this , at all events . Are you for the rich or for the poor ? "
24302	24325	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Too difficult . Ask me another . Am I for poverty or for riches ? For riches . Hurrah for riches ! "
24326	24330	24332	24333	Mrs. Munt	268	" For riches ! "
24347	24357	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Yes . For riches . Money for ever ! "
24358	24388	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" So am I , and so , I am afraid , are most of my acquaintances at Swanage , but I am surprised that you agree with us . "
24389	24410	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Thank you so much , Aunt Juley . While I have talked theories , you have done the flowers . "
24411	24431	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Not at all , dear . I wish you would let me help you in more important things . "
24432	24467	23558	23559	her aunt	635	" Well , would you be very kind ? Would you come round with me to the registry office ? There 's a housemaid who wo n't say yes but does n't say no . "
24493	24570	24482	24482	Evie	265	" according to Mrs. Munt . Oh yes , it was a nuisance , there was no doubt of it . Helen was proof against a passing encounter but - Margaret began to lose confidence . Might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes ? And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight , and Frieda was sharp , abominably sharp , and quite capable of remarking , "
24582	24609	24573	24578	one of the young gentlemen opposite	1208	" The remark would be untrue , but of the kind which , if stated often enough , may become true ; just as the remark , "
24618	24749	24573	24578	one of the young gentlemen opposite	1208	" renders war a little more likely each time that it is made , and is therefore made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation . Have the private emotions also their gutter press ? Margaret thought so , and feared that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of it . They might , by continual chatter , lead Helen into a repetition of the desires of June . Into a repetition - they could not do more ; they could not lead her into lasting love . They were - she saw it clearly - Journalism ; her father , with all his defects and wrong - headedness , had been Literature , and had he lived , he would have persuaded his daughter rightly .
24782	24785	24770	24770	her	278	" temporary , "
24843	24856	24819	24819	she	278	" Helen , you must tell me whether this thing worries you . "
24857	24861	24863	24863	Helen	268	" If what ? "
24873	24879	24911	24911	she	278	" The W. 's coming . "
24880	24887	24911	24911	she	278	" No , of course not . "
24888	24891	24911	24911	she	278	" Really ? "
24892	24895	24897	24897	she	278	" Really . "
24938	24968	24911	24911	she	278	" I sha n't mind if Paul points at our house and says , ' There lives the girl who tried to catch me . ' But she might . "
24969	25012	24911	24911	she	278	" If even that worries you , we could arrange something . There 's no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease , thanks to our money . We might even go away for a little . "
25013	25068	24911	24911	she	278	" Well , I am going away . Frieda 's just asked me to Stettin , and I sha n't be back till after the New Year . Will that do ? Or must I fly the country altogether ? Really , Meg , what has come over you to make such a fuss ? "
25069	25107	25109	25109	she	1218	" Oh , I 'm getting an old maid , I suppose . I thought I minded nothing , but really I - I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and "
25114	25140	25109	25109	she	1218	" you did go red , you know , when Aunt Juley attacked you this morning . I should n't have referred to it otherwise . "
25343	25346	25348	25349	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Helen ! "
25362	25369	25353	25353	she	293	" his mother has forgiven you ! "
25406	25410	25391	25391	she	293	" keine Dame . "
25411	25417	25419	25419	Margaret	278	" Bother the whole family ! "
25421	25445	25419	25419	Margaret	278	" Helen , stop giggling and pirouetting , and go and finish your packing . Why ca n't the woman leave us alone ? "
25446	25458	25459	25459	Helen	268	" I do n't know what I shall do with Meg , "
25467	25508	25459	25459	Helen	268	" She 's got Wilcox and Box upon the brain . Meg , Meg , I do n't love the young gentleman ; I do n't love the young gentleman , Meg , Meg . Can a body speak plainer ? "
25509	25517	25519	25520	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Most certainly her love has died , "
25522	25548	25459	25459	Helen	268	" Most certainly it has , Frieda , but that will not prevent me from being bored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call . "
25568	25603	25555	25556	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Oh , boo hoo ! boo hoo hoo ! Meg 's going to return the call , and I ca n't . 'Cos why ? 'Cos I 'm going to German - eye . "
25604	25631	25459	25459	Helen	268	" If you are going to Germany , go and pack ; if you are n't , go and call on the Wilcoxes instead of me . "
25632	25675	25555	25556	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" But , Meg , Meg , I do n't love the young gentleman ; I do n't love the young - 0 lud , who 's that coming down the stairs ? I vow ' tis my brother . 0 crimini ! "
25746	25750	25742	25742	she	268	" the Wilcox ideal "
25854	25876	25838	25839	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" It is all right - she does not love the young man - he has not been worthy of her . "
25877	25887	25838	25839	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Yes , I know ; thanks very much . "
25888	25898	25838	25839	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" I thought I did right to tell you . "
25899	25905	25838	25839	Fraulein Mosebach	293	" Ever so many thanks . "
25906	25911	25913	25913	Tibby	262	" What 's that ? "
26547	26573	26528	26528	She	346	" Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , I have made the baddest blunder . I am more , more ashamed and sorry than I can say . "
26658	26673	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I knew he was going to India in November , but I forgot . "
26674	26686	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria , in Africa . "
26687	26708	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I knew - I know . I have been too absurd all through . I am very much ashamed . "
26715	26734	26709	26710	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I am more sorry than I can say , and I hope that you will forgive me . "
26735	26756	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" It does n't matter , Miss Schlegel . It is good of you to have come round so promptly . "
26757	26762	26764	26764	Margaret	346	" It does matter , "
26766	26790	26764	26764	Margaret	346	" I have been rude to you ; and my sister is not even at home , so there was not even that excuse .
26791	26794	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Indeed ? "
26795	26803	26764	26764	Margaret	346	" She has just gone to Germany . "
26804	26810	26812	26813	the other	1263	" She gone as well , "
26815	26831	26812	26813	the other	1263	" Yes , certainly , it is quite safe - safe , absolutely , now . "
26832	26839	26841	26841	Margaret	346	" You 've been worrying too ! "
26856	26881	26841	26841	Margaret	346	" How perfectly extraordinary ! I can see that you have . You felt as I do ; Helen must n't meet him again . "
26882	26889	26764	26764	Margaret	346	" I did think it best . "
26890	26894	26841	26841	Margaret	346	" Now why ? "
26895	26903	26905	26906	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" That 's a most difficult question , "
26919	26940	26914	26914	her	528	" I think you put it best in your letter - it was an instinct , which may be wrong . "
26941	26950	26841	26841	Margaret	346	" It was n't that your son still - "
26951	26967	26914	26914	her	528	" Oh no ; he often - my Paul is very young , you see . "
26968	26974	26841	26841	Margaret	346	" Then what was it ? "
26978	26986	26975	26975	She	528	" An instinct which may be wrong . "
26987	27032	26914	26914	her	528	" In other words , they belong to types that can fall in love , but could n't live together . That 's dreadfully probable . I 'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another . "
27033	27042	27044	27045	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" These are indeed ' other words , ' "
27047	27072	27044	27045	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I had nothing so coherent in my head . I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister . "
27073	27113	26914	26914	her	528	" Ah , I have always been wanting to ask you . How did you know ? Helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up , and you stepped forward and arranged things . Did Paul tell you ? "
27114	27125	27127	27128	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" There is nothing to be gained by discussing that , "
27135	27160	26914	26914	her	528	" Mrs. Wilcox , were you very angry with us last June ? I wrote you a letter and you did n't answer it . "
27161	27180	26914	26914	her	528	" I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson 's flat . I knew it was opposite your house . "
27181	27189	26914	26914	her	528	" But it 's all right now ? "
27190	27195	26914	26914	her	528	" I think so . "
27196	27215	26914	26914	her	528	" You only think ? You are n't sure ? I do love these little muddles tidied up ? "
27216	27224	27226	27227	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Oh yes , I 'm sure , "
27236	27251	27226	27227	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I always sound uncertain over things . It is my way of speaking . "
27252	27264	26914	26914	her	528	" That 's all right , and I 'm sure too . "
27293	27308	26914	26914	her	528	" I must say good - bye now - you will be getting up . "
27309	27332	26914	26914	her	528	" No - please stop a little longer - I am taking a day in bed . Now and then I do . "
27333	27345	26914	26914	her	528	" I thought of you as one of the early risers . "
27346	27363	26914	26914	her	528	" At Howards End - yes ; there is nothing to get up for in London . "
27364	27371	27373	27375	the scandalized Margaret	346	" Nothing to get up for ? "
27377	27398	27373	27375	the scandalized Margaret	346	" When there are all the autumn exhibitions , and Ysaye playing in the afternoon ! Not to mention people . "
27399	27435	26914	26914	her	528	" The truth is , I am a little tired . First came the wedding , and then Paul went off , and , instead of resting yesterday , I paid a round of calls . "
27436	27440	27373	27375	the scandalized Margaret	346	" A wedding ? "
27441	27453	26914	26914	her	528	" Yes ; Charles , my elder son , is married . "
27454	27457	27373	27375	the scandalized Margaret	346	" Indeed ! "
27458	27522	26914	26914	her	528	" We took the flat chiefly on that account , and also that Paul could get his African outfit . The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband 's , and she most kindly offered it to us . So before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of Dolly 's people , which we had not yet done . "
27531	27556	26914	26914	her	528	" Fussell . The father is in the Indian army - retired ; the brother is in the army . The mother is dead . "
27562	27566	27526	27526	Dolly	348	" chinless sunburnt men "
27673	27798	27628	27629	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time . They belong to the same club , and are both devoted to golf . Dolly plays golf too , though I believe not so well , and they first met in a mixed foursome . We all like her , and are very much pleased . They were married on the 11th , a few days before Paul sailed . Charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man , so he made a great point of having it on the 11th . The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas , but they were very nice about it . There is Dolly 's photograph - in that double frame . "
27799	27813	27849	27850	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Are you quite certain that I 'm not interrupting , Mrs. Wilcox ? "
27814	27819	27628	27629	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Yes , quite . "
27820	27831	27849	27850	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Then I will stay . I 'm enjoying this . "
27842	27847	27628	27629	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" For dear Mims , "
27853	27867	27849	27850	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" the name she and Charles had settled that she should call me . "
27933	27943	27906	27906	She	346	" They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon . "
27944	27948	27906	27906	She	346	" Lucky people ! "
27949	27958	27906	27906	She	346	" I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy . "
27959	27967	27906	27906	She	346	" Does n't he care for travelling ? "
27968	28035	27906	27906	She	346	" He likes travel , but he does see through foreigners so . What he enjoys most is a motor tour in England , and I think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable . His father gave him a car of his own for a wedding present , which for the present is being stored at Howards End . "
28036	28045	27906	27906	She	346	" I suppose you have a garage there ? "
28046	28085	27906	27906	She	346	" Yes . My husband built a little one only last month , to the west of the house , not far from the wych - elm , in what used to be the paddock for the pony . "
28096	28103	28105	28105	Margaret	346	" Where 's the pony gone ? "
28110	28123	27906	27906	She	346	" The pony ? Oh , dead , ever so long ago . "
28124	28142	27906	27906	She	346	" The wych - elm I remember . Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree . "
28143	28163	27906	27906	She	346	" It is the finest wych - elm in Hertfordshire . Did your sister tell you about the teeth ? "
28164	28167	27906	27906	She	346	" No . "
28168	28237	27906	27906	She	346	" Oh , it might interest you . There are pigs ' teeth stuck into the trunk , about four feet from the ground . The country people put them in long ago , and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark , it will cure the toothache . The teeth are almost grown over now , and no one comes to the tree . "
28238	28250	27906	27906	She	346	" I should . I love folklore and all festering superstitions . "
28251	28269	27906	27906	She	346	" Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache , if one believed in it ? "
28270	28283	27906	27906	She	346	" Of course it did . It would cure anything - once . "
28284	28311	27906	27906	She	346	" Certainly I remember cases - you see I lived at Howards End long , long before Mr. Wilcox knew it . I was born there . "
28454	28477	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" Good - bye , Miss Schlegel , good - bye . Thank you for coming . You have cheered me up . "
28478	28484	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I 'm so glad ! "
28485	28498	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I - I wonder whether you ever think about yourself . ? "
28499	28506	28508	28508	Margaret	346	" I think of nothing else , "
28523	28532	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I wonder . I wondered at Heidelberg . "
28533	28537	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I'M sure ! "
28538	28543	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I almost think - "
28544	28547	28549	28549	Margaret	346	" Yes ? "
28597	28608	28520	28521	the invalid	1278	" I almost think you forget you 're a girl . "
28617	28624	28625	28625	she	346	" I 'm twenty - nine , "
28628	28635	28625	28625	she	346	" That not so wildly girlish . "
28640	28658	28636	28637	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" What makes you say that ? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude ? "
28665	28700	28636	28637	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I only meant that I am fifty - one , and that to me both of you - Read it all in some book or other ; I can not put things clearly . "
28701	28729	28609	28609	Margaret	346	" Oh , I 've got it - inexperience . I 'm no better than Helen , you mean , and yet I presume to advise her . "
28730	28743	28636	28637	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Yes . You have got it . Inexperience is the word . "
28744	28747	28749	28749	Margaret	346	" Inexperience , "
28757	28894	28749	28749	Margaret	346	" Of course , I have everything to learn - absolutely everything - just as much as Helen . Life 's very difficult and full of surprises . At all events , I 've got as far as that . To be humble and kind , to go straight ahead , to love people rather than pity them , to remember the submerged - well , one ca n't do all these things at once , worse luck , because they 're so contradictory . It 's then that proportion comes in - to live by proportion . Do n't BEGIN with proportion . Only prigs do that . Let proportion come in as a last resource , when the better things have failed , and a deadlock - Gracious me , I 've started preaching ! "
28895	28906	28908	28909	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Indeed , you put the difficulties of life splendidly , "
28919	28934	28908	28909	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" It is just what I should have liked to say about them myself . "
29051	29057	29050	29064	the " one or two delightful people " who had been asked to meet her	1284	" one or two delightful people "
29286	29299	29300	29300	Margaret	346	" I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now . "
29306	29317	29300	29300	Margaret	346	" Yes , thank you ; I heard on Tuesday . "
29336	29359	29331	29331	she	346	" Only on Tuesday , for they live right away at Stettin . Did you ever know any one living at Stettin ? "
29360	29363	29365	29366	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Never , "
29409	29503	29405	29405	Margaret	346	" People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses . At least , our cousins do , but are n't particularly rich . The town is n't interesting , except for a clock that rolls its eyes , and the view of the Oder , which truly is something special . Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , you would love the Oder ! The river , or rather rivers - there seem to be dozens of them - are intense blue , and the plain they run through an intensest green . "
29504	29518	29405	29405	Margaret	346	" Indeed ! That sounds like a most beautiful view , Miss Schlegel . "
29519	29624	29405	29405	Margaret	346	" So I say , but Helen , who will muddle things , says no , it 's like music . The course of the Oder is to be like music . It 's obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem . The part by the landing - stage is in B minor , if I remember rightly , but lower down things get extremely mixed . There is a slodgy theme in several keys at once , meaning mud - banks , and another for the navigable canal , and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major , pianissimo . "
29625	29635	29637	29638	the man	807	" What do the overhanging warehouses make of that ? "
29642	29651	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" They make a great deal of it , "
29663	29749	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" I think it 's affectation to compare the Oder to music , and so do you , but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously , which we do n't , and the average Englishman does n't , and despises all who do . Now do n't say ' Germans have no taste , ' or I shall scream . They have n't . But - but - such a tremendous but ! - they take poetry seriously . They do take poetry seriously .
29750	29757	29405	29405	Margaret	346	" Is anything gained by that ? "
29758	29960	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" Yes , yes . The German is always on the lookout for beauty . He may miss it through stupidity , or misinterpret it , but he is always asking beauty to enter his life , and I believe that in the end it will come . At Heidelberg I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry . So easy for me to laugh - I , who never repeat poetry , good or bad , and can not remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with . My blood boils - well , I 'm half German , so put it down to patriotism - when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things Teutonic , whether they 're Bocklin or my veterinary surgeon . ' Oh , Bocklin , ' they say ; ' he strains after beauty , he peoples Nature with gods too consciously . ' Of course Bocklin strains , because he wants something - beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world . So his landscapes do n't come off , and Leader 's do . "
29961	29973	29975	29975	he	1300	" I am not sure that I agree . Do you ? "
29985	29993	29982	29982	She	528	" I think Miss Schlegel puts everything splendidly "
30003	30028	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , say something nicer than that . It 's such a snub to be told you put things splendidly . "
30029	30071	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" I do not mean it as a snub . Your last speech interested me so much . Generally people do not seem quite to like Germany . I have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side . "
30072	30091	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" The other side ? Then you do disagree . Oh , good ! Give us your side . "
30092	30101	30103	30103	her	528	" I have no side . But my husband "
30111	30129	30103	30103	her	528	" has very little faith in the Continent , and our children have all taken after him . "
30130	30146	29653	29653	Margaret	346	" On what grounds ? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form ? "
30288	30422	30620	30622	a girl opposite	1303	" You will admit , though , that the Continent - it seems silly to speak of ' the Continent , ' but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like England . England is unique . Do have another jelly first . I was going to say that the Continent , for good or for evil , is interested in ideas . Its Literature and Art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them , and this persists even through decadence and affectation . There is more liberty of action in England , but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic Prussia . People will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs . "
30423	30432	30434	30435	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I do not want to go to Prussian "
30437	30468	30434	30435	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" not even to see that interesting view that you were describing . And for discussing with humility I am too old . We never discuss anything at Howards End . "
30469	30475	30477	30477	Margaret	346	" Then you ought to ! "
30479	30496	30477	30477	Margaret	346	" Discussion keeps a house alive . It can not stand by bricks and mortar alone . "
30497	30505	30507	30508	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" It can not stand without them , "
30538	30570	30507	30508	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" It can not stand without them , and I sometimes think - But I can not expect your generation to agree , for even my daughter disagrees with me here . "
30571	30581	30477	30477	Margaret	346	" Never mind us or her . Do say ! "
30582	30598	30507	30508	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men . "
30605	30618	30620	30622	a girl opposite	1303	" One admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong , "
30631	30653	30507	30508	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Are they ? I never follow any arguments . I am only too thankful not to have a vote myself . "
30654	30667	30669	30669	Margaret	346	" We did n't mean the vote , though , did we ? "
30671	30732	30669	30669	Margaret	346	" Are n't we differing on something much wider , Mrs. Wilcox ? Whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history ; or whether , since men have moved forward so far , they too may move forward a little now . I say they may . I would even admit a biological change . "
30733	30744	30507	30508	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I do n't know , I do n't know . "
30745	30756	30758	30759	the man	807	" I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse , "
30761	30767	30758	30759	the man	807	" They 've turned disgracefully strict .
30773	30820	30821	30821	They	1305	" Oh , but come upstairs for a little . Miss Quested plays . Do you like MacDowell ? Do you mind him only having two noises ? If you must really go , I 'll see you out . Wo n't you even have coffee ? "
30846	30857	30843	30843	she	528	" What an interesting life you all lead in London ! "
30858	30865	30867	30867	Margaret	346	" No , we do n't , "
30874	30935	30843	30843	she	528	" We lead the lives of gibbering monkeys . Mrs. Wilcox - really - We have something quiet and stable at the bottom . We really have . All my friends have . Do n't pretend you enjoyed lunch , for you loathed it , but forgive me by coming again , alone , or by asking me to you . "
30936	30944	30946	30947	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I am used to young people , "
30963	31076	30946	30947	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I hear a great deal of chatter at home , for we , like you , entertain a great deal . With us it is more sport and politics , but - I enjoyed my lunch very much , Miss Schlegel , dear , and am not pretending , and only wish I could have joined in more . For one thing , I 'm not particularly well just today . For another , you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me . Charles is the same , Dolly the same . But we are all in the same boat , old and young . I never forget that . "
31450	31455	31457	31457	Margaret	346	" First of all , "
31459	31492	31457	31457	Margaret	346	" we must make a list and tick off the people 's names . My aunt always does , and this fog may thicken up any moment . Have you any ideas ? "
31493	31507	31509	31510	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" I thought we would go to Harrod 's or the Haymarket Stores , "
31514	31567	31509	31510	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Everything is sure to be there . I am not a good shopper . The din is so confusing , and your aunt is quite right - one ought to make a list . Take my notebook , then , and write your own name at the top of the page . "
31568	31573	31575	31575	Margaret	346	" Oh , hooray ! "
31580	31591	31575	31575	Margaret	346	" How very kind of you to start with me ! "
31682	31702	31679	31679	she	346	" I do n't really want a Yuletide gift , though . In fact , I 'd rather not . "
31703	31706	31679	31679	she	346	" Why ? "
31707	31735	31679	31679	she	346	" Because I 've odd ideas about Christmas . Because I have all that money can buy . I want more people , but no more things . "
31736	31789	31679	31679	she	346	" I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance , Miss Schlegel , in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight . It has so happened that I have been left alone , and you have stopped me from brooding . I am too apt to brood . "
31790	31796	31798	31798	Margaret	346	" If that is so , "
31800	31828	31798	31798	Margaret	346	" if I have happened to be of use to you , which I did n't know , you can not pay me back with anything tangible . "
31829	31851	31679	31679	she	346	" I suppose not , but one would like to . Perhaps I shall think of something as we go about . "
31940	31948	31913	31913	Margaret	346	" We always give the servants money . "
31949	31960	31962	31962	Margaret	346	" Yes , do you , yes , much easier , "
32010	32016	32000	32000	their	1335	" Join our Christmas goose club "
32257	32268	32269	32269	she	346	" No , I do like Christmas on the whole , "
32272	32294	32269	32269	she	346	" In its clumsy way , it does approach Peace and Goodwill . But oh , it is clumsier every year . "
32295	32307	32269	32269	she	346	" Is it ? I am only used to country Christmases . "
32308	32446	32269	32269	she	346	" We are usually in London , and play the game with vigour - carols at the Abbey , clumsy midday meal , clumsy dinner for the maids , followed by Christmas - tree and dancing of poor children , with songs from Helen . The drawing - room does very well for that . We put the tree in the powder - closet , and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted , and with the looking - glass behind it looks quite pretty . I wish we might have a powder - closet in our next house . Of course , the tree has to be very small , and the presents do n't hang on it . No ; the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper . "
32447	32467	32269	32269	she	346	" You spoke of your ' next house , ' Miss Schlegel . Then are you leaving Wickham Place ? "
32468	32485	32269	32269	she	346	" Yes , in two or three years , when the lease expires . We must . "
32486	32493	32269	32269	she	346	" Have you been there long ? "
32494	32499	32269	32269	she	346	" All our lives . "
32500	32510	32269	32269	she	346	" You will be very sorry to leave it . "
32511	32525	32526	32526	She	1347	" I suppose so . We scarcely realize it yet . My father - "
32553	32560	32561	32561	she	1347	" If possible , something distinctive , "
32588	32597	32567	32567	she	1347	" My husband and our daughter are motoring . "
32598	32610	32611	32611	Margaret	346	" Bertha too ? Oh , fancy , what a coincidence ! "
32688	32727	32685	32685	she	1347	" Do you know , I 'll wait . On second thoughts , I 'll wait . There 's plenty of time still , is n't there , and I shall be able to get Evie 's opinion . "
32745	32754	32742	32742	she	1347	" But could n't you get it renewed ? "
32755	32761	32763	32763	Margaret	346	" I beg your pardon ? "
32765	32772	32685	32685	she	1347	" The lease , I mean . "
32773	32795	32685	32685	she	1347	" Oh , the lease ! Have you been thinking of that all the time ? How very kind of you ! "
32796	32803	32685	32685	she	1347	" Surely something could be done . "
32804	32827	32685	32685	she	1347	" No ; values have risen too enormously . They mean to pull down Wickham Place , and build flats like yours . "
32828	32833	32685	32685	she	1347	" But how horrible ! "
32834	32839	32685	32685	she	1347	" Landlords are horrible . "
32845	32945	32841	32841	she	1347	" It is monstrous , Miss Schlegel ; it is n't right . I had no idea that this was hanging over you . I do pity you from the bottom of my heart . To be parted from your house , your father 's house - it ought n't to be allowed . It is worse than dying . I would rather die than - Oh , poor girls ! Can what they call civilization be right , if people may n't die in the room where they were born ? My dear , I am so sorry - "
32969	32984	32685	32685	she	1347	" Howards End was nearly pulled down once . It would have killed me . "
32985	33028	32685	32685	she	1347	" Howards End must be a very different house to ours . We are fond of ours , but there is nothing distinctive about it . As you saw , it is an ordinary London house . We shall easily find another . "
33029	33034	32685	32685	she	1347	" So you think . "
33035	33045	33047	33047	Margaret	346	" Again my lack of experience , I suppose ! "
33055	33104	33047	33047	Margaret	346	" I ca n't say anything when you take up that line , Mrs. Wilcox . I wish I could see myself as you see me - foreshortened into a backfisch . Quite the ingenue . Very charming - wonderfully well read for my age , but incapable - "
33112	33122	33123	33123	she	528	" Come down with me to Howards End now , "
33131	33163	33123	33123	she	528	" I want you to see it . You have never seen it . I want to hear what you say about it , for you do put things so wonderfully . "
33180	33188	33189	33189	she	528	" Later on I should love it , "
33192	33223	33189	33189	she	528	" but it 's hardly the weather for such an expedition , and we ought to start when we 're fresh . Is n't the house shut up , too ? "
33236	33244	33229	33230	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Might I come some other day ? "
33254	33262	33245	33246	Mrs. Wilcox	528	" Back to Wickham Place , please ! "
33275	33288	33332	33332	her	346	" A thousand thanks , Miss Schlegel , for all your help . "
33289	33294	33332	33332	her	346	" Not at all . "
33295	33321	33332	33332	her	346	" It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind - the Christmas - cards especially . I do admire your choice . "
33338	33431	33332	33332	her	346	" My husband and Evie will be back the day after tomorrow . That is why I dragged you out shopping today . I stayed in town chiefly to shop , but got through nothing , and now he writes that they must cut their tour short , the weather is so bad , and the police - traps have been so bad - nearly as bad as in Surrey . Ours is such a careful chauffeur , and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like roadhogs . "
33432	33435	33332	33332	her	346	" Why ? "
33436	33450	33332	33332	her	346	" Well , naturally he - he is n't a road - hog . "
33451	33473	33332	33332	her	346	" He was exceeding the speed - limit , I conclude . He must expect to suffer with the lower animals . "
33677	33685	33686	33686	Her	346	" Might I come some other day ? "
33936	33939	33944	33945	a fool	3967	" another day "
33947	33950	33923	33923	she	346	" Another day "
34211	34220	34222	34222	Margaret	346	" I will come if I still may , "
34227	34270	34272	34272	she	346	" You are coming to sleep , dear , too . It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful . You are coming to stop . I can not show you my meadow properly except at sunrise . These fogs "
34279	34303	34272	34272	she	346	" never spread far . I dare say they are sitting in the sun in Hertfordshire , and you will never repent joining them .
34304	34312	34272	34272	she	346	" I shall never repent joining you . "
34313	34319	34272	34272	she	346	" It is the same . "
34356	34361	34363	34367	a heavy - browed girl	1392	" Mother ! Mother ! "
34383	34386	34387	34387	she	1392	" Evie ! "
34390	34396	34387	34387	she	1392	" Evie , my pet - "
34401	34412	34397	34398	The girl	969	" Father ! I say ! look who 's here . "
34413	34426	34363	34367	a heavy - browed girl	1392	" Evie , dearest girl , why are n't you in Yorkshire ? "
34427	34440	34397	34398	The girl	969	" No - motor smash - changed plans - Father 's coming . "
34441	34446	34448	34449	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Why , Ruth ! "
34454	34471	34448	34449	Mr. Wilcox	261	" What in the name of all that 's wonderful are you doing here , Ruth ? "
34478	34504	34397	34398	The girl	969	" Oh , Henry dear ! - here 's a lovely surprise - but let me introduce - but I think you know Miss Schlegel . "
34505	34510	34511	34511	he	261	" Oh , yes , "
34518	34526	34511	34511	he	261	" But how 's yourself , Ruth ? "
34527	34533	34534	34534	she	528	" Fit as a fiddle , "
34538	34570	34397	34398	The girl	969	" So are we and so was our car , which ran A-1 as far as Ripon , but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver - "
34571	34584	34397	34398	The girl	969	" Miss Schlegel , our little outing must be for another day . "
34585	34602	34397	34398	The girl	969	" I was saying that this fool of a driver , as the policeman himself admits - "
34603	34613	34397	34398	The girl	969	" Another day , Mrs. Wilcox . Of course . "
34614	34633	34397	34398	The girl	969	" - But as we 've insured against third party risks , it wo n't so much matter - "
34634	34645	34397	34398	The girl	969	" - Cart and car being practically at right angles - "
35269	35281	35282	35282	he	1437	" They did n't ought to have coloured flowers at buryings , "
35424	35442	35410	35420	The wood - cutter , returning after a night of joy	1445	" They lilies , they chrysants ; it 's a pity I did n't take them all . "
35653	35669	35670	35670	Her	346	" Henry , why do people who have enough money try to get more money ? "
35675	35696	35697	35697	Her	346	" I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet , there would be no more wars . "
35757	35763	35751	35751	she	346	" a more inward light , "
35766	35775	35751	35751	she	346	" not so much for myself as for baby "
35843	35855	35856	35856	he	879	" Why did n't you tell me you knew of it ? "
35867	35888	35861	35861	her	346	" I did n't want to , Henry - I might have been wrong - and every one hates illnesses . "
36176	36184	36186	36186	Evie	265	" The post 's come , Father , "
36189	36196	36186	36186	Evie	265	" Thanks . Put it down . "
36197	36205	36212	36213	The girl	969	" Has the breakfast been all right ? "
36206	36211	36186	36186	Evie	265	" Yes , thanks . "
36231	36240	36212	36213	The girl	969	" Charles says do you want the TIMES ? "
36241	36250	36212	36213	The girl	969	" No , I 'll read it later . "
36251	36264	36212	36213	The girl	969	" Ring if you want anything , Father , wo n't you ? "
36265	36272	36212	36213	The girl	969	" I 've all I want . "
36290	36296	36297	36297	she	969	" Father 's eaten nothing , "
36332	36344	36320	36320	he	879	" Look here , Father , you must eat , you know "
36361	36374	36375	36375	he	879	" He 's going to read his letters first , I think , "
36379	36392	36375	36375	he	879	" I dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards . "
36564	36576	36577	36577	he	1483	" They had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday , "
36583	36587	36577	36577	he	1483	" No indeed . "
36588	36597	36598	36598	he	1483	" I must make a note of that , "
36601	36611	36598	36598	he	1483	" I am surprised that the rector allowed it . "
36612	36623	36577	36577	he	1483	" Perhaps it may not be the rector 's affair . "
36624	36631	36598	36598	he	1483	" Whose else could it be ? "
36632	36639	36577	36577	he	1483	" The lord of the manor . "
36640	36643	36598	36598	he	1483	" Impossible . "
36644	36649	36577	36577	he	1483	" Butter , Dolly ? "
36650	36659	36598	36598	he	1483	" Thank you , Evie dear . Charles - "
36660	36665	36577	36577	he	1483	" Yes , dear ? "
36666	36683	36598	36598	he	1483	" I did n't know one could pollard elms . I thought one only pollarded willows . "
36684	36693	36577	36577	he	1483	" Oh no , one can pollard elms . "
36694	36708	36598	36598	he	1483	" Then why ought n't the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded ? "
36721	36731	36709	36709	Charles	364	" Another point . I must speak to Chalkeley . "
36732	36742	36577	36577	he	1483	" Yes , rather ; you must complain to Chalkeley .
36743	36762	36709	36709	Charles	364	" It 's no good him saying he is not responsible for those men . He is responsible . "
36763	36768	36577	36577	he	1483	" Yes , rather . "
37433	37435	37421	37421	He	261	" Morning "
37453	37463	37421	37421	He	261	" Hullo ! my new car 's been driven ! "
37464	37470	37421	37421	He	261	" Has it , sir ? "
37471	37474	37476	37476	Charles	261	" Yes , "
37482	37506	37476	37476	Charles	261	" and whoever 's driven it has n't cleaned it properly , for there 's mud on the axle . Take it off . "
37560	37563	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Charles - "
37593	37615	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" One minute , I 'm busy . Well , Crane , who 's been driving it , do you suppose ? "
37616	37658	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Do n't know , I 'm sure , sir . No one 's driven it since I 've been back , but , of course , there 's the fortnight I 've been away with the other car in Yorkshire . "
37665	37690	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Charles , your father 's down . Something 's happened . He wants you in the house at once . Oh , Charles ! "
37691	37714	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Wait , dear , wait a minute . Who had the key to the garage while you were away , Crane ? "
37715	37721	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" The gardener , sir . "
37722	37737	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor ? "
37738	37753	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" No , sir ; no one 's had the motor out , sir . "
37754	37767	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" Then how do you account for the mud on the axle ? "
37768	37793	37564	37565	His bride	1533	" I ca n't , of course , say for the time I 've been in Yorkshire . No more mud now , sir . "
37867	37886	37845	37846	his wife	1450	" Now , Dolly , I can attend to you . Miss Schlegel ? What does she want ? "
37923	37929	37919	37920	his wife	1450	" She wants Howards End . "
37930	37949	37985	37985	his	261	" Howards End ? Now , Crane , just do n't forget to put on the Stepney wheel . "
37950	37955	37919	37920	his wife	1450	" No , sir . "
37956	37973	37983	37983	he	261	" Now , mind you do n't forget , for I - Come , little woman . "
38016	38025	37985	37985	his	261	" But you have n't listened , Charles - "
38026	38031	38007	38007	he	261	" What 's wrong ? "
38032	38047	37985	37985	his	261	" I keep on telling you - Howards End . Miss Schlegels got it . "
38048	38052	38054	38054	Charles	261	" Got what ? "
38059	38068	38054	38054	Charles	261	" What the dickens are you talking about ? "
38069	38082	37985	37985	his	261	" Now , Charles , you promised not to say those naughty - "
38083	38103	38054	38054	Charles	261	" Look here , I 'm in no mood for foolery . It 's no morning for it either . "
38104	38140	37985	37985	his	261	" I tell you - I keep on telling you - Miss Schlegel - she 's got it - your mother 's left it to her - and you 've all got to move out ! "
38141	38145	38054	38054	Charles	261	" HOWARDS END ? "
38146	38150	38151	38151	she	1450	" HOWARDS END ! "
38170	38187	38189	38189	she	1450	" Dolly , go back at once ! My father 's much annoyed with you . Charles "
38194	38212	38189	38189	she	1450	" come in at once to Father . He 's had a letter that 's too awful . "
38246	38250	38243	38243	He	261	" Schlegels again ! "
38261	38277	38258	38258	Dolly	348	" Oh no , the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her . "
38278	38287	38289	38290	his father	4006	" Come in , all three of you ! "
38296	38305	38289	38290	his father	4006	" Dolly , why have you disobeyed me ? "
38306	38312	38243	38243	He	261	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox - "
38313	38344	38289	38290	his father	4006	" I told you not to go out to the garage . I 've heard you all shouting in the garden . I wo n't have it . Come in . "
38358	38398	38345	38345	He	4006	" Into the dining - room , every one of you . We ca n't discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants . Here , Charles , here ; read these . See what you make . "
38455	38471	38449	38449	herself	4237	" To my husband : I should like Miss Schlegel Margaret to have Howards End . "
38472	38485	38486	38486	he	261	" I suppose we 're going to have a talk about this ? "
38492	38504	38449	38449	herself	4237	" Certainly . I was coming out to you when Dolly - "
38505	38513	38449	38449	herself	4237	" Well , let 's sit down . "
38514	38527	38449	38449	herself	4237	" Come , Evie , do n't waste time , sit down . "
38590	38645	38577	38577	Charles	261	" A note in my mother 's handwriting , in an envelope addressed to my father , sealed . Inside : ' I should like Miss Schlegel Margaret to have Howards End . ' No date , no signature . Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home . Now , the question is - "
38650	38673	38646	38646	Dolly	348	" But I say that note is n't legal . Houses ought to be done by a lawyer , Charles , surely . "
38723	38728	38711	38711	Charles	261	" Give it her . "
38738	38755	38729	38729	She	348	" Why , it 's only in pencil ! I said so . Pencil never counts . "
38756	38768	38770	38771	Mr. Wilcox	261	" We know that it is not legally binding , Dolly , "
38780	38836	38770	38771	Mr. Wilcox	261	" We are aware of that . Legally , I should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire . Of course , my dear , we consider you as one of the family , but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand . "
38851	38856	38857	38857	He	261	" The question is - "
38882	38902	38903	38903	He	261	" The question is whether Miss Schlegel , during the fortnight we were all away , whether she unduly - "
38906	38913	38915	38916	his father	4006	" I do n't think that , "
38926	38932	38915	38916	his father	4006	" Do n't think what ? "
38933	38968	38915	38916	his father	4006	" That she would have - that it is a case of undue influence . No , to my mind the question is the - the invalid 's condition at the time she wrote . "
38969	38993	38915	38916	his father	4006	" My dear father , consult an expert if you like , but I do n't admit it is my mother 's writing . "
38994	39003	39005	39005	Dolly	348	" Why , you just said it was ! "
39007	39014	39015	39015	he	261	" Never mind if I did , "
39019	39025	39015	39015	he	261	" and hold your tongue . "
39634	39638	39624	39628	The woman who had died	1569	" Do this , "
39643	39648	39640	39640	they	1559	" We will not . "
39674	39695	39670	39670	they	1559	" She was a dear mother , a true wife : in our absence she neglected her health and died . "
39700	39714	39697	39697	they	1559	" She was not as true , as dear , as we supposed . "
39743	39746	39739	39739	they	1559	" Treachery . "
39908	39913	39915	39916	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Ah , well ! "
39923	39932	39915	39916	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I should n't have thought it possible . "
39933	39941	39943	39943	Evie	265	" Mother could n't have meant it , "
39948	39958	39915	39916	Mr. Wilcox	261	" No , my girl , of course not . "
39959	39984	39915	39916	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Mother believed so in ancestors too - it is n't like her to leave anything to an outsider , who 'd never appreciate . "
39985	39993	39994	39994	he	261	" The whole thing is unlike her , "
39997	40044	39994	39994	he	261	" If Miss Schlegel had been poor , if she had wanted a house , I could understand it a little . But she has a house of her own . Why should she want another ? She would n't have any use of Howards End . "
40045	40051	40053	40053	Charles	261	" That time may prove , "
40055	40058	40060	40061	his sister	1485	" How ? "
40063	40091	39994	39994	he	261	" Presumably she knows - mother will have told her . She got twice or three times into the nursing home . Presumably she is awaiting developments . "
40092	40098	40100	40100	Dolly	348	" What a horrid woman ! "
40108	40122	40100	40100	Dolly	348	" Why , she may be coming down to turn us out now ! "
40128	40134	40135	40135	he	261	" I wish she would , "
40139	40147	40135	40135	he	261	" I could then deal with her . "
40148	40153	40155	40156	his father	4006	" So could I , "
40205	40232	40185	40186	the boy	753	" I could deal with her , if she comes , but she wo n't come . You 're all a bit hard on Miss Schlegel . "
40233	40243	40155	40155	his	261	" That Paul business was pretty scandalous , though . "
40244	40363	40364	40364	He	1580	" I want no more of the Paul business , Charles , as I said at the time , and besides , it is quite apart from this business . Margaret Schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week , and we have all suffered under her , but upon my soul she 's honest . She 's not in collusion with the matron . I 'm absolutely certain of it . Nor was she with the doctor . I 'm equally certain of that . She did not hide anything from us , for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are . She , like ourselves , was a dupe - "
40370	40443	40364	40364	He	1580	" You see , Charles , in her terrible pain your poor mother put us all in false positions . Paul would not have left England , you would not have gone to Italy , nor Evie and I into Yorkshire , if only we had known . Well , Miss Schlegel 's position has been equally false . Take all in all , she has not come out of it badly . "
40447	40452	40444	40444	Evie	265	" But those chrysanthemums - "
40453	40463	40465	40465	Dolly	348	" Or coming down to the funeral at all - "
40467	40529	40444	40444	Evie	265	" Why should n't she come down ? She had the right to , and she stood far back among the Hilton women . The flowers - certainly we should not have sent such flowers , but they may have seemed the right thing to her , Evie , and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany . "
40530	40541	40543	40543	Evie	265	" Oh , I forget she is n't really English , "
40545	40552	40543	40543	Evie	265	" That would explain a lot . "
40553	40559	40561	40561	Charles	261	" She 's a cosmopolitan , "
40568	40649	40561	40561	Charles	261	" I admit I 'm rather down on cosmopolitans . My fault , doubtless . I can not stand them , and a German cosmopolitan is the limit . I think that 's about all , is n't it ? I want to run down and see Chalkeley . A bicycle will do . And , by the way , I wish you 'd speak to Crane some time . I 'm certain he 's had my new car out . "
40650	40658	40685	40686	his father	4006	" Has he done it any harm ? "
40659	40662	40561	40561	Charles	261	" No . "
40663	40682	40685	40686	his father	4006	" In that case I shall let it pass . It 's not worth while having a row . "
41190	41194	41189	41189	she	278	" loved superstition . "
41323	41327	41328	41328	they	3880	" her sort , "
41440	41445	41484	41484	Helen	257	" telegrams and anger , "
41555	41562	41563	41563	she	1612	" Do n't brood too much , "
41568	41605	41563	41563	she	1612	" on the superiority of the unseen to the seen . It 's true , but to brood on it is mediaeval . Our business is not to contrast the two , but to reconcile them . "
41760	41776	41780	41780	she	257	" It is n't size that counts so much as the way things are arranged . "
42024	42037	42020	42020	She	257	" Oh , how lovely ! That 's the place for me ! "
42048	42057	42063	42063	she	295	" I have a message , dear Helen , "
42122	42132	42134	42134	Helen	257	" And there will even be someone for Tibby , "
42136	42198	42134	42134	Helen	257	" There now , Tibby , think of that ; Frieda is saving up a little girl for you , in pig - tails and white worsted stockings , but the feet of the stockings are pink , as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries . I 've talked too much . My head aches . Now you talk . "
42478	42493	42475	42475	she	278	" Helen , I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox ; that sad business ? "
42494	42497	42475	42475	she	278	" Yes . "
42498	42566	42475	42475	she	278	" I have had a correspondence with her son . He was winding up the estate , and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything . I thought it good of him , considering I knew her so little . I said that she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present , but we both forgot about it afterwards . "
42567	42575	42475	42475	she	278	" I hope Charles took the hint . "
42576	42727	42475	42475	she	278	" Yes - that is to say , her husband wrote later on , and thanked me for being a little kind to her , and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette . Do n't you think that is extraordinarily generous ? It has made me like him very much . He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance , but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in the future . I like Mr. Wilcox . He is taking up his work - rubber - it is a big business . I gather he is launching out rather . Charles is in it , too . Charles is married - a pretty little creature , but she does n't seem wise . They took on the flat , but now they have gone off to a house of their own . "
43835	43851	43832	43832	she	278	" I was thinking of Mr. Vyse . He never strikes me as particularly happy . "
43852	43857	43859	43859	Tibby	262	" Ye - es , "
43957	43986	43990	43991	the general	1698	" But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched , weedy man , do n't you think ? Then there 's Guy . That was a pitiful business . Besides "
43993	44004	44005	44005	Groans	386	" every one is the better for some regular work . "
44007	44014	44015	44015	she	257	" I shall stick to it , "
44020	44114	44015	44015	she	257	" I am not saying it to educate you ; it is what I really think . I believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work , and they must not starve it . It 's a new desire . It goes with a great deal that 's bad , but in itself it 's good , and I hope that for women , too , ' not to work ' will soon become as shocking as ' not to be married ' was a hundred years ago . "
44115	44129	44131	44131	Tibby	262	" I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude , "
44133	44178	44015	44015	she	257	" Then we 'll leave the subject till you do . I 'm not going to rattle you round . Take your time . Only do think over the lives of the men you like most , and see how they 've arranged them . "
44179	44188	44190	44190	Tibby	262	" I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most , "
44213	44255	44256	44256	She	1699	" And do n't think I 'm not serious because I do n't use the traditional arguments - making money , a sphere awaiting you , and so on - all of which are , for various reasons , ca nt . "
44260	44297	44299	44299	she	1699	" I 'm only your sister . I have n't any authority over you , and I do n't want to have any . Just to put before you what I think the truth . You see "
44313	44343	44299	44299	she	1699	" in a few years we shall be the same age practically , and I shall want you to help me . Men are so much nicer than women . "
44344	44357	44299	44299	she	1699	" Labouring under such a delusion , why do you not marry ? "
44358	44372	44299	44299	she	1699	" I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance . "
44373	44379	44299	44299	she	1699	" Has nobody arst you ? "
44380	44384	44299	44299	she	1699	" Only ninnies . "
44385	44391	44299	44299	she	1699	" Do people ask Helen ? "
44392	44395	44299	44299	she	1699	" Plentifully . "
44396	44402	44299	44299	she	1699	" Tell me about them . "
44403	44406	44299	44299	she	1699	" No . "
44407	44416	44299	44299	she	1699	" Tell me about your ninnies , then . "
44417	44428	44435	44435	she	1485	" They were men who had nothing better to do , "
44443	44533	44435	44435	she	1485	" So take warning : you must work , or else you must pretend to work , which is what I do . Work , work , work if you 'd save your soul and your body . It is honestly a necessity , dear boy . Look at the Wilcoxes , look at Mr. Pembroke . With all their defects of temper and understanding , such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and I think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly .
44534	44540	44541	44541	he	1700	" Spare me the Wilcoxes , "
44544	44555	44435	44435	she	1485	" I shall not . They are the right sort . "
44556	44564	44565	44565	he	1700	" Oh , goodness me , Meg ! "
44588	44603	44435	44435	she	1485	" Well , they 're as near the right sort as you can imagine . "
44604	44613	44435	44435	she	1485	" No , no - oh , no ! "
44614	44657	44435	44435	she	1485	" I was thinking of the younger son , whom I once classed as a ninny , but who came back so ill from Nigeria . He 's gone out there again , Evie Wilcox tells me - out to his duty . "
44658	44660	44435	44435	she	1485	" Duty "
44666	44723	44435	44435	she	1485	" He does n't want the money , it is work he wants , though it is beastly work - dull country , dishonest natives , an eternal fidget over fresh water and food . A nation who can produce men of that sort may well be proud . No wonder England has become an Empire . "
44724	44727	44435	44435	she	1485	" EMPIRE ! "
44728	44736	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" I ca n't bother over results , "
44744	44795	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" They are too difficult for me . I can only look at the men . An Empire bores me , so far , but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up . London bores me , but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make London - "
44796	44801	44802	44802	he	1702	" What it is , "
44805	44834	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" What it is , worse luck . I want activity without civilization . How paradoxical ! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven . "
44835	44839	44841	44841	Tibby	262	" And I , "
44843	44864	44841	44841	Tibby	262	" want civilization without activity , which , I expect , is what we shall find in the other place . "
44865	44893	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" You need n't go as far as the other place , Tibbi - kins , if you want that . You can find it at Oxford . "
44894	44897	44841	44841	Tibby	262	" Stupid - "
44898	44958	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" If I 'm stupid , get me back to the house - hunting . I 'll even live in Oxford if you like - North Oxford . I 'll live anywhere except Bournemouth , Torquay , and Cheltenham . Oh yes , or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge Wells and Surbiton and Bedford . There on no account . "
44959	44964	44841	44841	Tibby	262	" London , then . "
44965	45050	44738	44738	Margaret	278	" I agree , but Helen rather wants to get away from London . However , there 's no reason we should n't have a house in the country and also a flat in town , provided we all stick together and contribute . Though of course - Oh , how one does maunder on , and to think , to think of the people who are really poor . How do they live ? Not to move about the world would kill me . "
45072	45102	45103	45103	Helen	257	" Oh , my dears , what do you think ? You 'll never guess . A woman 's been here asking me for her husband . Her WHAT ? "
45112	45125	45108	45108	her	257	" Yes , for her husband , and it really is so . "
45126	45134	45136	45136	Margaret	278	" Not anything to do with Bracknell ? "
45155	45230	45108	45108	her	257	" I offered Bracknell , and he was rejected . So was Tibby . Cheer up , Tibby ! It 's no one we know . I said , ' Hunt , my good woman ; have a good look round , hunt under the tables , poke up the chimney , shake out the antimacassars . Husband ? husband ? ' Oh , and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier . "
45231	45241	45108	45108	her	257	" Now , Helen , what did happen really ? "
45242	45350	45108	45108	her	257	" What I say . I was , as it were , orating my speech . Annie opens the door like a fool , and shows a female straight in on me , with my mouth open . Then we began - very civilly . ' I want my husband , what I have reason to believe is here . ' No - how unjust one is . She said ' whom , ' not ' what . ' She got it perfectly . So I said , ' Name , please ? ' and she said , ' Lan , Miss , ' and there we were .
45351	45354	45108	45108	her	257	" Lan ? "
45355	45370	45108	45108	her	257	" Lan or Len . We were not nice about our vowels . Lanoline . "
45371	45377	45108	45108	her	257	" But what an extraordinary - "
45378	45424	45108	45108	her	257	" I said , ' My good Mrs. Lanoline , we have some grave misunderstanding here . Beautiful as I am , my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty , and never , never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine . ' "
45425	45432	45434	45434	Tibby	262	" I hope you were pleased , "
45436	45440	45441	45441	Helen	257	" Of course , "
45444	45532	45441	45441	Helen	257	" A perfectly delightful experience . Oh , Mrs. Lanoline 's a dear - she asked for a husband as if he was an umbrella . She mislaid him Saturday afternoon - and for a long time suffered no inconvenience . But all night , and all this morning her apprehensions grew . Breakfast did n't seem the same - no , no more did lunch , and so she strolled up to 2 , Wickham Place as being the most likely place for the missing article . "
45533	45539	45108	45108	her	257	" But how on earth - "
45540	45711	45441	45441	Helen	257	" Do n't begin how on earthing . ' I know what I know , ' she kept repeating , not uncivilly , but with extreme gloom . In vain I asked her what she did know . Some knew what others knew , and others did n't , and if they did n't , then others again had better be careful . Oh dear , she was incompetent ! She had a face like a silkworm , and the dining - room reeks of orris - root . We chatted pleasantly a little about husbands , and I wondered where hers was too , and advised her to go to the police . She thanked me . We agreed that Mr. Lanoline 's a notty , notty man , and has n't no business to go on the lardy - da . But I think she suspected me up to the last . Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about this . Now , Meg , remember - bags I. "
45712	45719	45721	45721	Margaret	278	" Bag it by all means , "
45728	45753	45721	45721	Margaret	278	" I 'm not sure that this is so funny , Helen . It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere , does n't it ? "
45754	45776	45441	45441	Helen	257	" I do n't think so - she does n't really mind . The admirable creature is n't capable of tragedy . "
45777	45785	45787	45787	Margaret	278	" Her husband may be , though , "
45794	45813	45787	45787	Margaret	278	" Oh , no , not likely . No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs. Lanoline . "
45814	45819	45441	45441	Helen	257	" Was she pretty ? "
45820	45829	45787	45787	Margaret	278	" Her figure may have been good once . "
45893	45908	45909	45909	she	278	" Tibby and I have again been wondering where we 'll live next September , "
45914	45925	45927	45927	Helen	257	" Tibby had better first wonder what he 'll do , "
46064	46070	46061	46061	He	319	" about the lady yesterday . "
46086	46091	46093	46093	Helen	257	" Cheers , children ! "
46095	46101	46093	46093	Helen	257	" It 's Mrs. Lanoline . "
46366	46378	46380	46380	he	1714	" You would n't remember giving me this , Miss Schlegel ? "
46385	46395	46553	46553	Helen	257	" No ; I ca n't say I do . "
46396	46408	46506	46506	He	1714	" Well , that was how it happened , you see . "
46409	46426	46553	46553	Helen	257	" Where did we meet , Mr. Bast ? For the minute I do n't remember . "
46427	46444	46445	46445	he	1714	" It was a concert at the Queen 's Hall . I think you will recollect , "
46449	46466	46445	46445	he	1714	" when I tell you that it included a performance of the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven . "
46467	46491	46553	46553	Helen	257	" We hear the Fifth practically every time it 's done , so I 'm not sure - do you remember , Helen ? "
46492	46505	46445	46445	he	1714	" Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade ? "
46510	46527	46553	46553	Helen	257	" Then I do n't remember . That 's the only Beethoven I ever remember specially . "
46528	46547	46553	46553	Helen	257	" And you , if I may say so , took away my umbrella , inadvertently of course . "
46548	46552	46553	46553	Helen	257	" Likely enough , "
46556	46574	46553	46553	Helen	257	" for I steal umbrellas even oftener than I hear Beethoven . Did you get it back ? "
46575	46584	46553	46553	Helen	257	" Yes , thank you , Miss Schlegel . "
46585	46597	46599	46599	Margaret	278	" The mistake arose out of my card , did it ? "
46601	46613	46553	46553	Helen	257	" Yes , the mistake arose - it was a mistake . "
46614	46635	46636	46636	she	257	" The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too , and that she could find you ? "
46659	46670	46553	46553	Helen	257	" That 's so , calling too - a mistake . "
46671	46676	46678	46678	Helen	257	" Then why - ? "
46689	46696	46697	46697	he	1714	" I said to my wife , "
46702	46788	46697	46697	he	1714	" I said to Mrs. Bast , ' I have to pay a call on some friends , ' and Mrs. Bast said to me , ' Do go . ' While I was gone , however , she wanted me on important business , and thought I had come here , owing to the card , and so came after me , and I beg to tender my apologies , and hers as well , for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you . "
46789	46793	46795	46795	Helen	257	" No inconvenience , "
46797	46805	46795	46795	Helen	257	" but I still do n't understand . "
46850	46866	46847	46847	she	257	" I still do n't understand . When did you say you paid this call ? "
46867	46873	46875	46875	he	319	" Call ? What call ? "
46898	46903	46931	46932	a repartee	1727	" This afternoon call . "
46904	46912	46913	46913	he	319	" In the afternoon , of course ! "
46940	46947	46928	46928	Tibby	262	" Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon ? "
46948	46953	46931	46932	a repartee	1727	" S - Saturday . "
46954	46957	46959	46959	Helen	257	" Really ! "
46961	46980	46959	46959	Helen	257	" and you were still calling on Sunday , when your wife came here . A long visit . "
46981	46989	46991	46992	Mr. Bast	319	" I do n't call that fair , "
47006	47019	47003	47003	his	319	" I know what you mean , and it is n't so . "
47020	47029	47031	47031	Margaret	278	" Oh , do n't let us mind , "
47041	47047	47048	47048	he	319	" It was something else , "
47057	47070	47051	47051	his	319	" I was somewhere else to what you think , so there ! "
47071	47082	47083	47083	she	278	" It was good of you to come and explain , "
47086	47096	47083	47083	she	278	" The rest is naturally no concern of ours . "
47097	47117	47051	47051	his	319	" Yes , but I want - I wanted - have you ever read THE ORDEAL OF RICHARD FEVEREL ? "
47121	47159	47118	47118	Margaret	278	" It 's a beautiful book . I wanted to get back to the Earth , do n't you see , like Richard does in the end . Or have you ever read Stevenson 's PRINCE OTTO ? "
47166	47185	47186	47186	He	262	" That 's another beautiful book . You get back to the Earth in that . I wanted - "
47207	47215	47217	47217	Leonard	317	" I walked all the Saturday night , "
47219	47223	47217	47217	Leonard	317	" I walked . "
47256	47274	47254	47254	Helen	257	" No doubt it 's another beautiful book , but I 'd rather hear about your road . "
47275	47281	47254	47254	Helen	257	" Oh , I walked . "
47282	47286	47254	47254	Helen	257	" How far ? "
47287	47307	47254	47254	Helen	257	" I do n't know , nor for how long . It got too dark to see my watch . "
47308	47318	47254	47254	Helen	257	" Were you walking alone , may I ask ? "
47319	47322	47323	47323	he	262	" Yes , "
47329	47387	47323	47323	he	262	" but we 'd been talking it over at the office . There 's been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things . The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star , and I looked it up in the celestial atlas , but once out of doors everything gets so mixed - "
47388	47399	47401	47401	Helen	257	" Do n't talk to me about the Pole Star , "
47408	47428	47401	47401	Helen	257	" I know its little ways . It goes round and round , and you go round after it . "
47429	47455	47491	47491	Helen	257	" Well , I lost it entirely . First of all the street lamps , then the trees , and towards morning it got cloudy . "
47514	47521	47523	47523	Margaret	278	" Where did you start from ? "
47525	47531	47523	47523	Margaret	278	" Do tell us more . "
47532	47591	47491	47491	Helen	257	" I took the Underground to Wimbledon . As I came out of the office I said to myself , ' I must have a walk once in a way . If I do n't take this walk now , I shall never take it . ' I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon , and then - "
47592	47602	47523	47523	Margaret	278	" But not good country there , is it ? "
47603	47638	47491	47491	Helen	257	" It was gas - lamps for hours . Still , I had all the night , and being out was the great thing . I did get into woods , too , presently . "
47639	47645	47647	47647	Helen	257	" Yes , go on , "
47649	47664	47491	47491	Helen	257	" You 've no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it 's dark . "
47665	47674	47491	47491	Helen	257	" Did you actually go off the roads ? "
47675	47705	47491	47491	Helen	257	" Oh yes . I always meant to go off the roads , but the worst of it is that it 's more difficult to find one 's way . "
47706	47716	47718	47718	Margaret	278	" Mr. Bast , you 're a born adventurer , "
47720	47752	47718	47718	Margaret	278	" No professional athlete would have attempted what you 've done . It 's a wonder your walk did n't end in a broken neck . Whatever did your wife say ? "
47753	47763	47765	47765	Helen	257	" Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses , "
47767	47782	47765	47765	Helen	257	" Besides , they ca n't walk . It tires them . Go on . "
47783	47797	47491	47491	Helen	257	" I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in VIRGINIBUS - "
47798	47818	47765	47765	Helen	257	" Yes , but the wood . This ' ere wood . How did you get out of it ? "
47819	47915	47491	47491	Helen	257	" I managed one wood , and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill . I rather fancy it was those North Downs , for the road went off into grass , and I got into another wood . That was awful , with gorse bushes . I did wish I 'd never come , but suddenly it got light - just while I seemed going under one tree . Then I found a road down to a station , and took the first train I could back to London . "
47916	47923	47925	47925	Helen	257	" But was the dawn wonderful ? "
47933	47936	47930	47930	he	1734	" No . "
47969	47974	47976	47976	his	1734	" love of the earth "
48008	48021	48297	48298	a lady	1013	" The dawn was only grey , it was nothing to mention - "
48022	48034	48297	48298	a lady	1013	" Just a grey evening turned upside down . I know . "
48035	48273	48297	48298	a lady	1013	" - and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it , and so cold too . I 'm glad I did it , and yet at the time it bored me more than I can say . And besides - you can believe me or not as you choose - I was very hungry . That dinner at Wimbledon - I meant it to last me all night like other dinners . I never thought that walking would make such a difference . Why , when you 're walking you want , as it were , a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well , and I 'd nothing but a packet of Woodbines . Lord , I did feel bad ! Looking back , it was n't what you may call enjoyment . It was more a case of sticking to it . I did stick . I - I was determined . Oh , hang it all ! what 's the good - I mean , the good of living in a room for ever ? There one goes on day after day , same old game , same up and down to town , until you forget there is any other game . You ought to see once in a way what 's going on outside , if it 's only nothing particular after all . "
48274	48282	48284	48284	Helen	257	" I should just think you ought , "
48310	48324	48307	48307	he	1737	" Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard Jefferies . "
48325	48349	48355	48355	him	1737	" Excuse me , Mr. Bast , but you 're wrong there . It did n't . It came from something far greater . "
48530	48540	48541	48541	he	317	" Then you do n't think I was foolish ? "
48560	48565	48567	48567	Margaret	278	" Heavens , no ! "
48569	48577	48579	48579	Helen	257	" Heaven help us if we do ! "
48581	48605	48555	48555	Nature	381	" I 'm very glad you say that . Now , my wife would never understand - not if I explained for days . "
48606	48614	48616	48616	Helen	257	" No , it was n't foolish ! "
48622	48637	48616	48616	Helen	257	" You 've pushed back the boundaries ; I think it splendid of you . "
48638	48650	48555	48555	Nature	381	" You 've not been content to dream as we have - "
48651	48659	48616	48616	Helen	257	" Though we have walked , too - "
48660	48669	48555	48555	Nature	381	" I must show you a picture upstairs - "
48689	48720	48677	48678	The hansom	1742	" Oh , bother , not to say dash - I had forgotten we were dining out ; but do , do , come round again and have a talk . "
48721	48729	48731	48731	Margaret	278	" Yes , you must - do , "
48741	48754	48733	48733	Leonard	317	" No , I shall not . It 's better like this . "
48755	48759	48761	48761	Margaret	278	" Why better ? "
48763	48822	48677	48678	The hansom	1742	" No , it is better not to risk a second interview . I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life . Really . I mean this . We can never repeat . It has done me real good , and there we had better leave it . "
48823	48835	48878	48878	he	317	" That 's rather a sad view of life , surely . "
48836	48843	48677	48678	The hansom	1742	" Things so often get spoiled . "
48844	48848	48850	48850	Helen	257	" I know , "
48852	48858	48850	48850	Helen	257	" but people do n't . "
48949	48968	48946	48946	Helen	257	" Go , then ; perhaps you know best ; but never forget you 're better than Jefferies . "

49496	49510	49479	49479	Jacky	325	" Yes , do n't you wish you knew what that card was ? "
49511	49519	49479	49479	Jacky	325	" Len , who 's Miss Schlegel ? "
49595	49613	49591	49591	he	317	" A lady took my umbrella , another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella "
49660	49681	49654	49654	he	317	" Well , at all events , she does n't know about that card . Yah ! done her there ! "

I can not have you speaking out of your role . It makes my poor head go round , and I think you forget that I am very ill . "
50934	50950	50952	50952	Margaret	278	" Your head wo n't go round if only you 'll listen to my argument , "
50954	50974	50952	50952	Margaret	278	" Why not give him the money itself . You 're supposed to have about thirty thousand a year . "
50975	50986	50868	50872	the reader of the paper	1799	" Have I ? I thought I had a million . "
50987	51035	50952	50952	Margaret	278	" Was n't a million your capital ? Dear me ! we ought to have settled that . Still , it does n't matter . Whatever you 've got , I order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each . "

51064	51113	50868	50872	the reader of the paper	1799	" Not if you gave them so much . A big windfall would not pauperize a man . It is these little driblets , distributed among too many , that do the harm . Money 's educational . It 's far more educational than the things it buys . "
51119	51124	51126	51126	Margaret	278	" In a sense , "
51133	51155	51126	51126	Margaret	278	" Well , is n't the most civilized thing going , the man who has learnt to wear his income properly ? "
51156	51166	50952	50952	Margaret	278	" Exactly what your Mr. Basts wo n't do . "

When your Socialism comes it may be different , and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash . Till it comes give people cash , for it is the warp of civilization , whatever the woof may be . The imagination ought to play upon money and realize it vividly , for it 's the - the second most important thing in the world . It is so sluffed over and hushed up , there is so little clear thinking - oh , political economy , of course , but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes , and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means . Money : give Mr. Bast money , and do n't bother about his ideals . He 'll pick up those for himself . "
51420	51440	51417	51417	She	278	" Nothing , but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world . "

52068	52074	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" I do n't know . "
52075	52082	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" I think we wo n't . "
52083	52088	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" As you like . "
52089	52147	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" It 's no good , I think , unless you really mean to know people . The discussion brought that home to me . We got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement , but think of rational intercourse . We must n't play at friendship . No , it 's no good . "
52148	52156	52157	52157	Helen	257	" There 's Mrs. Lanoline , too , "
52160	52164	52157	52157	Helen	257	" So dull . "
52165	52175	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" Just so , and possibly worse than dull . "

52191	52204	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" But he said - something about a concert and an umbrella - "
52205	52214	52157	52157	Helen	257	" Then did the card see the wife - "
52215	52222	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" Helen , come to bed . "
52223	52253	52157	52157	Helen	257	" No , just a little longer , it is so beautiful . Tell me ; oh yes ; did you say money is the warp of the world ? "
52254	52257	52034	52036	The earnest girl	1814	" Yes . "
52258	52265	52157	52157	Helen	257	" Then what 's the woof ? "
52266	52273	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" Very much what one chooses , "
52277	52292	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" It 's something that is n't money - one ca n't say more . "
52293	52298	52157	52157	Helen	257	" Walking at night ? "
52299	52302	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" Probably . "
52303	52309	52157	52157	Helen	257	" For Tibby , Oxford ? "
52310	52315	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" It seems so . "
52316	52320	52157	52157	Helen	257	" For you ? "
52321	52348	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" Now that we have to leave Wickham Place , I begin to think it 's that . For Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End . "
52385	52401	52403	52403	Margaret	278	" It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people , "
52405	52439	52275	52275	Margaret	278	" Why , Meg ? They 're so much nicer generally . I 'd rather think of that forester 's house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who lived in it . "
52440	52491	52534	52534	His	261	" I believe we shall come to care about people less and less , Helen . The more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them . It 's one of the curses of London . I quite expect to end my life caring most for a place . "
52507	52513	52514	52514	he	261	" How do you do ? "
52517	52533	52514	52514	he	261	" I thought I recognized your voices . Whatever are you both doing down here ? "
52573	52609	52534	52534	His	261	" What an age it is since I 've seen you , Mr. Wilcox . I met Evie in the Tube , though , lately . I hope you have good news of your son . "
52610	52613	52615	52616	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Paul ? "
52628	52652	52615	52616	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Oh , Paul 's all right . We had a line from Madeira . He 'll be at work again by now . "
52653	52656	52658	52658	Helen	257	" Ugh - "
52665	52671	52534	52534	His	261	" I beg your pardon ? "
52672	52682	52534	52534	His	261	" Is n't the climate of Nigeria too horrible ? "
52683	52690	52691	52691	he	261	" Someone 's got to go , "
52695	52733	52691	52691	he	261	" England will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices . Unless we get firm in West Africa , Ger - untold complications may follow . Now tell me all your news . "
52734	52744	52746	52746	Helen	257	" Oh , we 've had a splendid evening , "
52759	52820	52746	52746	Helen	257	" We belong to a kind of club that reads papers , Margaret and I - all women , but there is a discussion after . This evening it was on how one ought to leave one 's money - whether to one 's family , or to the poor , and if so how - oh , most interesting . "
52974	52981	52982	52982	he	1849	" Sounds a most original entertainment ! "
52992	53022	52982	52982	he	1849	" I wish Evie would go to that sort of thing . But she has n't the time . She 's taken to breed Aberdeen terriers - jolly little dogs .
53023	53036	52988	52988	his	1849	" I expect we 'd better be doing the same , really . "
53037	53048	53050	53050	Helen	257	" We pretend we 're improving ourselves , you see , "
53090	53124	52988	52988	his	1849	" We suppose it is a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate , but , as my sister says , it may be better to breed dogs . "
53125	53172	53223	53223	Margaret	278	" Not at all . I do n't agree with your sister . There 's nothing like a debate to teach one quickness . I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a youngster . It would have helped me no end . "
53173	53177	52988	52988	his	1849	" Quickness - ? "
53178	53218	53223	53223	Margaret	278	" Yes . Quickness in argument . Time after time I 've missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I have n't . Oh , I believe in these discussions . "
53302	53316	53318	53318	he	261	" Oh yes , it does n't much matter what subject you take , "
53325	53339	53320	53320	Margaret	278	" But this is going to be far better than the debate itself . "
53347	53356	53357	53357	she	257	" No , I wo n't go on , "
53360	53372	53357	53357	she	257	" I 'll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox . "
53373	53391	53320	53320	Margaret	278	" About Mr. Bast ? Yes , do . He 'll be more lenient to a special case .
53392	53428	53357	53357	she	257	" But , Mr. Wilcox , do first light another cigarette . It 's this . We 've just come across a young fellow , who 's evidently very poor , and who seems interest - "
53429	53435	53320	53320	Margaret	278	" What 's his profession ? "
53436	53439	53357	53357	she	257	" Clerk . "
53440	53444	53320	53320	Margaret	278	" What in ? "
53445	53452	53357	53357	she	257	" Do you remember , Margaret ? "
53453	53459	53320	53320	Margaret	278	" Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company . "
53460	53739	53357	53357	she	257	" Oh yes ; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new hearth - rug . He seems interesting , in some ways very , and one wishes one could help him . He is married to a wife whom he does n't seem to care for much . He likes books , and what one may roughly call adventure , and if he had a chance - But he is so poor . He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes . One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink . Well , he got mixed up in our debate . He was n't the subject of it , but it seemed to bear on his point . Suppose a millionaire died , and desired to leave money to help such a man . How should he be helped ? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct , which was Margaret 's plan ? Most of them thought this would pauperize him . Should he and those like him be given free libraries ? I said ' No ! ' He does n't want more books to read , but to read books rightly . My suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday , but then there is his wife , and they said she would have to go too . Nothing seemed quite right ! Now what do you think ? Imagine that you were a millionaire , and wanted to help the poor . What would you do ? "
53758	53818	53740	53741	Mr. Wilcox	261	" My dear Miss Schlegel , I will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread . I will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested . My only contribution is this : let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed . "
53819	53822	53824	53824	Margaret	278	" Why ? "
53831	53852	53853	53853	he	261	" This is between friends . It 'll be in the Receiver 's hands before Christmas . It 'll smash , "
53863	53882	53828	53828	his	261	" Dear me , Helen , listen to that . And he 'll have to get another place ! "
53883	53902	53828	53828	his	261	" Will have ? Let him leave the ship before it sinks . Let him get one now . "
53903	53912	53828	53828	his	261	" Rather than wait , to make sure ? "
53913	53916	53828	53828	his	261	" Decidedly . "
53917	53922	53828	53828	his	261	" Why 's that ? "
53933	53999	53828	53828	his	261	" Naturally the man who 's in a situation when he applies stands a better chance , is in a stronger position , than the man who is n't . It looks as if he 's worth something . I know by myself - this is letting you into the State secrets - it affects an employer greatly . Human nature , I 'm afraid . "
54000	54008	54010	54010	Margaret	278	" I had n't thought of that , "
54016	54043	54013	54013	Helen	257	" Our human nature appears to be the other way round . We employ people because they 're unemployed . The boot man , for instance . "
54044	54053	53828	53828	his	261	" And how does he clean the boots ? "
54054	54058	54060	54060	Margaret	278	" Not well , "
54062	54067	53828	53828	his	261	" There you are ! "
54068	54080	53828	53828	his	261	" Then do you really advise us to tell this youth - "
54081	54086	54087	54087	he	1862	" I advise nothing , "
54105	54152	54099	54099	his	1862	" I ought n't to have spoken - but I happen to know , being more or less behind the scenes . The Porphyrion 's a bad , bad concern - Now , do n't say I said so . It 's outside the Tariff Ring . "
54153	54171	53828	53828	his	261	" Certainly I wo n't say . In fact , I do n't know what that means . "
54172	54181	54183	54183	Helen	257	" I thought an insurance company never smashed , "
54187	54199	54183	54183	Helen	257	" Do n't the others always run in and save them ? "
54200	54207	54209	54210	Mr. Wilcox	261	" You 're thinking of reinsurance , "
54213	54265	54209	54210	Mr. Wilcox	261	" It is exactly there that the Porphyrion is weak . It has tried to undercut , has been badly hit by a long series of small fires , and it has n't been able to reinsure . I 'm afraid that public companies do n't save one another for love . "
54266	54275	54277	54277	Helen	257	" ' Human nature , ' I suppose , "
54316	54321	54313	54313	he	261	" Yes , extremely , "
54354	54362	54364	54364	Margaret	278	" And how 's Howards End looking ? "
54392	54397	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" It 's let . "
54398	54419	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Really . And you wandering homeless in long - haired Chelsea ? How strange are the ways of Fate ! "
54420	54432	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" No ; it 's let unfurnished . We 've moved . "
54433	54452	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Why , I thought of you both as anchored there for ever . Evie never told me . "
54453	54518	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I dare say when you met Evie the thing was n't settled . We only moved a week ago . Paul has rather a feeling for the old place , and we held on for him to have his holiday there ; but , really , it is impossibly small . Endless drawbacks . I forget whether you 've been up to it ? "
54519	54528	54375	54376	Mr. Wilcox	261	" As far as the house , never . "
54529	54671	54672	54672	He	1872	" Well , Howards End is one of those converted farms . They do n't really do , spend what you will on them . We messed away with a garage all among the wych - elm roots , and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a mockery . Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants . But it did n't do - no , it did n't do . You remember , or your sister will remember , the farm with those abominable guinea - fowls , and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly , so that it all went thin at the bottom . And , inside the house , the beams - and the staircase through a door - picturesque enough , but not a place to live in . "
54679	54755	54672	54672	He	1872	" Full tide . And the position was n't right either . The neighbourhood 's getting suburban . Either be in London or out of it , I say ; so we 've taken a house in Ducie Street , close to Sloane Street , and a place right down in Shropshire - Oniton Grange . Ever heard of Oniton ? Do come and see us - right away from everywhere , up towards Wales . "
54756	54761	54763	54763	Margaret	278	" What a change ! "
54780	54792	54770	54770	her	278	" I ca n't imagine Howards End or Hilton without you . "
54793	54800	54801	54801	he	1874	" Hilton is n't without us , "
54804	54810	54801	54801	he	1874	" Charles is there still . "
54811	54814	54816	54816	Margaret	278	" Still ? "
54828	54868	54816	54816	Margaret	278	" But I thought he was still at Epsom . They were furnishing that Christmas - one Christmas . How everything alters ! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our windows very often . Was n't it Epsom ? "
54869	54884	54886	54886	his	1874	" Yes , but they moved eighteen months ago . Charles , the good chap "
54890	54951	54886	54886	his	1874	" thought I should be lonely . I did n't want him to move , but he would , and took a house at the other end of Hilton , down by the Six Hills . He had a motor , too . There they all are , a very jolly party - he and she and the two grandchildren . "
54952	54968	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" I manage other people 's affairs so much better than they manage them themselves , "
54976	55007	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" When you moved out of Howards End , I should have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it . I should have kept so remarkable a place in the family . "
55008	55013	55014	55014	he	1876	" So it is , "
55017	55030	55014	55014	he	1876	" I have n't sold it , and do n't mean to . "
55031	55041	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" No ; but none of you are there . "
55042	55117	55014	55014	he	1876	" Oh , we 've got a splendid tenant - Hamar Bryce , an invalid . If Charles ever wanted it - but he wo n't . Dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences . No , we have all decided against Howards End . We like it in a way , but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other . One must have one thing or the other . "
55118	55141	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" And some people are lucky enough to have both . You 're doing yourself proud , Mr. Wilcox . My congratulations . "
55142	55146	55148	55148	Helen	257	" And mine , "
55150	55175	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" Do remind Evie to come and see us - two , Wickham Place . We sha n't be there very long , either . "
55176	55185	54970	54970	Margaret	278	" You , too , on the move ? "
55186	55190	55191	55191	Margaret	278	" Next September , "
55194	55203	55191	55191	Margaret	278	" Every one moving ! Good - bye . "
55268	55324	55262	55262	Helen	257	" What a prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has grown ! I have very little use for him in these days . However , he did tell us about the Porphyrion . Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever we get home , and tell him to clear out of it at once . "
55325	55338	55262	55262	Helen	257	" Do ; yes , that 's worth doing . Let us . "
55339	55347	55262	55262	Helen	257	" Let 's ask him to tea . "
55371	55374	55376	55376	Margaret	278	" Sugar ? "
55378	55381	55383	55383	Helen	257	" Cake ? "
55385	55431	55383	55383	Helen	257	" The big cake or the little deadlies ? I 'm afraid you thought my letter rather odd , but we 'll explain - we are n't odd , really - not affected , really . We 're over - expressive : that 's all . "
55491	55503	55485	55485	Helen	257	" The more a lady has to say , the better , "
55507	55512	55513	55513	she	257	" Oh , yes , "
55516	55520	55485	55485	Helen	257	" Ladies brighten - "
55521	55540	55485	55485	Helen	257	" Yes , I know . The darlings are regular sunbeams . Let me give you a plate . "
55541	55549	55551	55551	Margaret	278	" How do you like your work ? "
55637	55643	55644	55644	he	317	" Oh , well enough , "
55647	55658	55644	55644	he	317	" Your company is the Porphyrion , is n't it ? "
55659	55665	55644	55644	he	317	" Yes , that 's so "
55671	55680	55644	55644	he	317	" It 's funny how things get round . "
55681	55685	55687	55687	Helen	257	" Why funny ? "
55699	55728	55687	55687	Helen	257	" It was written as large as life on your card , and considering we wrote to you there , and that you replied on the stamped paper - "
55729	55742	55744	55744	Margaret	278	" Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance Companies ? "
55746	55754	55687	55687	Helen	257	" It depends what you call big . "
55755	55779	55687	55687	Helen	257	" I mean by big , a solid , well - established concern , that offers a reasonably good career to its employes . "
55780	55796	55798	55799	the employe	1887	" I could n't say - some would tell you one thing and others another , "
55802	55807	55809	55809	he	317	" For my own part "
55814	55853	55809	55809	he	317	" I only believe half I hear . Not that even ; it 's safer . Those clever ones come to the worse grief , I 've often noticed . Ah , you ca n't be too careful . "
55893	55918	55811	55811	his	317	" I quite agree , and that 's why I was curious to know : is it a solid , well - established concern ? "
56160	56170	56172	56172	Helen	268	" We were told the Porphyrion 's no go , "
56174	56187	56172	56172	Helen	268	" We wanted to tell you ; that 's why we wrote . "
56188	56201	56203	56203	Margaret	278	" A friend of ours did think that it is unsufficiently reinsured , "
56217	56224	56225	56225	he	317	" You can tell your friend , "
56228	56235	56225	56225	he	317	" that he 's quite wrong . "
56236	56241	56208	56208	his	317	" Oh , good ! "
56285	56292	56293	56293	he	317	" Wrong , so to speak , "
56296	56304	56333	56335	the elder woman	1319	" How ' so to speak ' ? "
56305	56317	56333	56335	the elder woman	1319	" I mean I would n't say he 's right altogether . "
56324	56331	56333	56335	the elder woman	1319	" Then he is right partly , "
56356	56392	56333	56335	the elder woman	1319	" Mr. Bast , I do n't understand business , and I dare say my questions are stupid , but can you tell me what makes a concern ' right ' or ' wrong ' ? "
56400	56420	56393	56393	Leonard	317	" Our friend , who is also a business man , was so positive . He said before Christmas - "
56421	56431	56433	56433	Helen	268	" And advised you to clear out of it , "
56435	56450	56433	56433	Helen	268	" But I do n't see why he should know better than you do . "
56564	56568	56555	56555	One	602	" the Miss Schlegels "
56590	56596	56597	56597	he	317	" One can but see , "
56602	56612	56597	56597	he	317	" as Ibsen says , ' things happen . ' "
56725	56743	56708	56708	They	1913	" How much exactly have you , and how much do you expect to have next June ? "
56855	56861	56852	56852	Margaret	278	" So YOU like Carlyle , "
56869	56875	56880	56882	two prancing puppies	1918	" Mr. Wilcox , Miss Wilcox "
56884	56899	56901	56901	Helen	268	" Oh , the dears ! Oh , Evie , how too impossibly sweet ! "
56910	56918	56920	56921	Mr. Wilcox	261	" We brought the little fellows round , "
56923	56929	56880	56882	two prancing puppies	1918	" I bred 'em myself . "
56930	56944	56984	56998	one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1919	" Oh , really ! Mr. Bast , come and play with puppies . "
56945	56954	56956	56956	Leonard	317	" I 've got to be going now , "
56959	56968	56984	56998	one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1919	" But play with puppies a little first . "
56969	56978	56980	56980	Evie	265	" This is Ahab , that 's Jezebel , "
57000	57008	57018	57018	him	317	" I 've got to be going . "
57020	57036	57018	57018	him	317	" Mr. Wilcox , Mr. Ba - Must you be really ? Good - bye ! "
57037	57041	57043	57043	Helen	268	" Come again , "
57071	57086	57067	57067	He	317	" No , I sha n't ; I knew it would be a failure . "
57095	57108	57067	57067	He	317	" A little mistake . We tried knowing another class - impossible . "
57133	57154	57130	57130	Helen	268	" I call that a very rude remark . What do you want to turn on me like that for ? "
57169	57179	57130	57130	Helen	268	" You ask me why I turn on you ? "
57180	57183	57130	57130	Helen	268	" Yes . "
57184	57195	57130	57130	Helen	268	" What do you want to have me here for ? "
57196	57205	57207	57207	Helen	268	" To help you , you silly boy ! "
57209	57215	57207	57207	Helen	268	" And do n't shout . "
57216	57245	57246	57246	He	1924	" I do n't want your patronage . I do n't want your tea . I was quite happy . What do you want to unsettle me for ? "
57252	57273	57246	57246	He	1924	" I put it to this gentleman . I ask you , sir , am to have my brain picked ? "
57292	57311	57286	57286	he	261	" Are we intruding , Miss Schlegel ? Can we be of any use or shall we go ? "
57317	57342	57343	57343	he	261	" I 'm connected with a leading insurance company , sir . I receive what I take to be an invitation from these - ladies "
57348	57369	57343	57343	he	261	" I come , and it 's to have my brain picked . I ask you , is it fair ? "
57370	57374	57376	57377	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Highly unfair , "
57394	57413	57343	57343	he	261	" There , you hear that ? Most unfair , the gentleman says . There ! Not content with "
57419	57426	57343	57343	he	261	" you ca n't deny it . "
57443	57511	57427	57427	His	261	" But as soon as I 'm useful it 's a very different thing . ' Oh yes , send for him . Cross - question him . Pick his brains . ' Oh yes . Now , take me on the whole , I 'm a quiet fellow : I 'm law - abiding , I do n't wish any unpleasantness ; but I - I - "
57512	57515	57517	57517	Margaret	278	" You , "
57519	57524	57517	57517	Margaret	278	" you - you - "
57534	57548	57427	57427	His	261	" You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star . "
57552	57558	57559	57559	Laughter	417	" You saw the sunrise . "
57561	57593	57427	57427	His	261	" You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all - away past books and houses to the truth . You were looking for a real home . "
57594	57602	57604	57604	Leonard	317	" I fail to see the connection , "
57611	57615	57427	57427	His	261	" So do I. "
57621	57780	57427	57427	His	261	" You were that last Sunday - you are this today . Mr. Bast ! I and my sister have talked you over . We wanted to help you ; we also supposed you might help us . We did not have you here out of charity - which bores us - but because we hoped there would be a connection between last Sunday and other days . What is the good of your stars and trees , your sunrise and the wind , if they do not enter into our daily lives ? They have never entered into mine , but into yours , we thought - Have n't we all to struggle against life 's daily greyness , against pettiness , against mechanical cheerfulness , against suspicion ? I struggle by remembering my friends ; others I have known by remembering some place - some beloved place or tree - we thought you one of these . "
57781	57792	57794	57794	Leonard	317	" Of course , if there 's been any misunderstanding , "
57796	57811	57812	57812	He	317	" all I can do is to go . But I beg to state - "
57828	57852	57817	57817	Jezebel	415	" You were picking my brain for official information - I can prove it - I - He blew his nose and left them .
57853	57860	57862	57863	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Can I help you now ? "
57869	57882	57862	57863	Mr. Wilcox	261	" May I have one quiet word with him in the hall ? "
57883	57901	57817	57817	Jezebel	415	" Helen , go after him - do anything - ANYTHING - to make the noodle understand . "
57905	57909	57911	57912	their visitor	1927	" But really - "
57914	57919	57911	57912	their visitor	1927	" Ought she to ? "
57928	57982	57925	57925	He	261	" I would have chimed in , but I felt that you could polish him off for yourselves - I did n't interfere . You were splendid , Miss Schlegel - absolutely splendid . You can take my word for it , but there are very few women who could have managed him . "
57983	57987	57989	57989	Margaret	278	" Oh yes , "
57992	58005	58007	58007	Evie	265	" Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me , "
58009	58014	58016	58017	her father	915	" Yes , indeed , "
58019	58033	58016	58017	her father	915	" all that part about ' mechanical cheerfulness ' - oh , fine ! "
58034	58040	58042	58042	Margaret	278	" I 'm very sorry , "
58047	58072	58042	58042	Margaret	278	" He 's a nice creature really . I can not think what set him off . It has been most unpleasant for you . "
58073	58081	58083	58083	he	915	" Oh , I did n't mind . "
58106	58116	58088	58088	He	915	" Ought n't you really to be more careful ? "
58128	58139	58140	58140	she	278	" Do you realize that it 's all your fault ? "
58143	58148	58140	58140	she	278	" You 're responsible . "
58149	58152	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I ? "
58153	58176	58140	58140	she	278	" This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion . We warn him , and - look ! "
58182	58191	58192	58192	he	261	" I hardly consider that a fair deduction , "
58195	58199	58201	58201	Margaret	278	" Obviously unfair , "
58203	58224	58201	58201	Margaret	278	" I was only thinking how tangled things are . It 's our fault mostly - neither yours nor his . "
58225	58229	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Not his ? "
58230	58233	58201	58201	Margaret	278	" No . "
58234	58243	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Miss Schlegel , you are too kind . "
58244	58249	58251	58251	Evie	265	" Yes , indeed , "
58257	58333	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" You behave much too well to people , and then they impose on you . I know the world and that type of man , and as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been treating him properly . You must keep that type at a distance . Otherwise they forget themselves . Sad , but true . They are n't our sort , and one must face the fact . "
58334	58339	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Ye - es . "
58340	58357	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman . "
58358	58364	58366	58366	Margaret	278	" I admit it willingly , "
58377	58388	58366	58366	Margaret	278	" A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself . "
58398	58406	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" What did he suspect you of ? "
58407	58417	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Of wanting to make money out of him . "
58418	58429	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Intolerable brute ! But how were you to benefit ? "
58430	58466	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Exactly . How indeed ! Just horrible , corroding suspicion . One touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away . Just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes . "
58467	58499	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I come back to my original point . You ought to be more careful , Miss Schlegel . Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in . "
58506	58524	58500	58500	She	278	" Let me explain exactly why we like this man , and want to see him again . "
58525	58542	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" That 's your clever way of thinking . I shall never believe you like him . "
58543	58597	58500	58500	She	278	" I do . Firstly , because he cares for physical adventure , just as you do . Yes , you go motoring and shooting ; he would like to go camping out . Secondly , he cares for something special IN adventure . It is quickest to call that special something poetry - "
58598	58609	58177	58178	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Oh , he 's one of that writer sort . "
58610	58682	58684	58684	she	1931	" No - oh no ! I mean he may be , but it would be loathsome stiff . His brain is filled with the husks of books , culture - horrible ; we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing . We want to show him how he may get upsides with life . As I said , either friends or the country , some "
58687	58723	58684	58684	she	1931	" either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life 's daily grey , and to show that it is grey . If possible , one should have both . "
58748	58795	58726	58726	her	1931	" Your mistake is this , and it is a very common mistake . This young bounder has a life of his own . What right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life , or , as you call it , ' grey ' ? "
58796	58799	58726	58726	her	1931	" Because - "
58800	58833	58835	58835	he	261	" One minute . You know nothing about him . He probably has his own joys and interests - wife , children , snug little home . That 's where we practical fellows "
58838	58989	58835	58835	he	261	" are more tolerant than you intellectuals . We live and let live , and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere , and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs . I quite grant - I look at the faces of the clerks in my own office , and observe them to be dull , but I do n't know what 's going on beneath . So , by the way , with London . I have heard you rail against London , Miss Schlegel , and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very angry with you . What do you know about London ? You only see civilization from the outside . I do n't say in your case , but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity , discontent , and Socialism . "
59029	59038	59004	59004	he	1935	" - to the special facts of the case .
59039	59047	59048	59048	she	1934	" His wife is an old bore , "
59052	59075	59048	59048	she	1934	" He never came home last Saturday night because he wanted to be alone , and she thought he was with us . "
59076	59080	59004	59004	he	1935	" With YOU ? "
59081	59084	59085	59085	Evie	265	" Yes . "
59088	59105	59085	59085	Evie	265	" He has n't got the cosy home that you assumed . He needs outside interests . "
59106	59111	59113	59114	the girl	969	" Naughty young man ! "
59116	59119	59121	59121	Margaret	278	" Naughty ? "
59130	59146	59121	59121	Margaret	278	" When you 're married , Miss Wilcox , wo n't you want outside interests ? "
59147	59154	59157	59158	Mr. Wilcox	261	" He has apparently got them , "
59161	59168	59085	59085	Evie	265	" Yes , indeed , Father . "
59169	59181	59183	59183	Margaret	278	" He was tramping in Surrey , if you mean that , "
59190	59197	59085	59085	Evie	265	" Oh , I dare say ! "
59198	59205	59085	59085	Evie	265	" Miss Wilcox , he was ! "
59206	59215	59217	59218	Mr. Wilcox	261	" M - m - m - m ! "
59252	59267	59240	59240	he	261	" He said so , and about such a thing he would n't lie . "
59274	59300	59268	59268	They	1939	" That 's where I differ from you . Men lie about their positions and prospects , but not about a thing of that sort . "
59306	59319	59303	59303	his	261	" Miss Schlegel , excuse me , but I know the type . "
59320	59391	59393	59393	she	1940	" I said before - he is n't a type . He cares about adventures rightly . He 's certain that our smug existence is n't all . He 's vulgar and hysterical and bookish , but I do n't think that sums him up . There 's manhood in him as well . Yes , that 's what I 'm trying to say . He 's a real man . "
59553	59582	59522	59522	she	278	" Miss Schlegel , you 're a pair of dear creatures , but you really MUST be careful in this uncharitable world . What does your brother say ? "
59583	59587	59522	59522	she	278	" I forget . "
59588	59595	59522	59522	she	278	" Surely he has some opinion ? "
59596	59605	59522	59522	she	278	" He laughs , if I remember correctly . "
59606	59616	59618	59618	Evie	265	" He 's very clever , is n't he ? "
59629	59643	59522	59522	she	278	" Yes , pretty well - but I wonder what Helen 's doing . "
59644	59656	59658	59659	Mr. Wilcox	261	" She is very young to undertake this sort of thing , "
59684	59687	59688	59688	she	278	" Helen ! "
59691	59694	59721	59721	her	278	" Yes ! "
59702	59707	59721	59721	her	278	" You in there ? "
59708	59717	59721	59721	her	278	" Yes - he 's gone some time . "
59723	59731	59732	59732	she	278	" Why , you 're all alone , "
59735	59750	59721	59721	her	278	" Yes - it 's all right , Meg - Poor , poor creature - "
59751	59771	59721	59721	her	278	" Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later - Mr. W. much concerned , and slightly titillated . "
59772	59822	59721	59721	her	278	" Oh , I 've no patience with him . I hate him . Poor dear Mr. Bast ! he wanted to talk literature , and we would talk business . Such a muddle of a man , and yet so worth pulling through . I like him extraordinarily . "
59823	59827	59829	59829	Margaret	278	" Well done , "
59834	59861	59829	59829	Margaret	278	" but come into the drawing - room now , and do n't talk about him to the Wilcoxes . Make light of the whole thing . "
59884	59892	59893	59893	she	268	" He 's gone with my blessing , "
59896	59902	59893	59893	she	268	" and now for puppies . "
59915	60003	59908	59909	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I am really concerned at the way those girls go on . They are as clever as you make 'em , but unpractical - God bless me ! One of these days they 'll go too far . Girls like that ought n't to live alone in London . Until they marry , they ought to have someone to look after them . We must look in more often - we 're better than no one . You like them , do n't you , Evie ? "
60007	60033	60004	60004	Evie	265	" Helen 's right enough , but I ca n't stand the toothy one . And I should n't have called either of them girls . "
60805	60808	60800	60800	she	278	" she accepted .
61019	61032	61038	61038	she	278	" Father might be of the party - yes , Father was . "
61052	61063	61065	61065	he	2011	" I thought I 'd get round if I could , "
61067	61139	61065	61065	he	2011	" Evie told me of her little plan , so I just slipped in and secured a table . Always secure a table first . Evie , do n't pretend you want to sit by your old father , because you do n't . Miss Schlegel , come in my side , out of pity . My goodness , but you look tired ! Been worrying round after your young clerks ? "
61140	61146	61148	61148	Margaret	278	" No , after houses , "
61157	61171	61148	61148	Margaret	278	" I 'm hungry , not tired ; I want to eat heaps . "
61172	61182	61065	61065	he	2011	" That 's good . What 'll you have ? "
61183	61187	61189	61189	she	278	" Fish pie , "
61198	61223	61065	61065	he	2011	" Fish pie ! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson 's . It 's not a bit the thing to go for here . "
61224	61233	61235	61235	Margaret	278	" Go for something for me , then , "
61258	61263	61265	61265	he	2011	" Saddle of mutton , "
61270	61309	61265	61265	he	2011	" and cider to drink . That 's the type of thing . I like this place , for a joke , once in a way . It is so thoroughly Old English . Do n't you agree ? "
61310	61313	61315	61315	Margaret	278	" Yes , "
61382	61393	61372	61372	He	419	" No , I did n't ; yes , you did "
61418	61435	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" It 's a golden rule to tip the carver . Tip everywhere 's my motto . "
61436	61445	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Perhaps it does make life more human . "
61446	61474	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Then the fellows know one again . Especially in the East , if you tip , they remember you from year 's end to year 's end .
61475	61483	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Have you been in the East ? "
61484	61551	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Oh , Greece and the Levant . I used to go out for sport and business to Cyprus ; some military society of a sort there . A few piastres , properly distributed , help to keep one 's memory green . But you , of course , think this shockingly cynical . How 's your discussion society getting on ? Any new Utopias lately ? "
61552	61579	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" No , I 'm house - hunting , Mr. Wilcox , as I 've already told you once . Do you know of any houses ? "
61580	61586	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Afraid I do n't . "
61587	61623	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Well , what 's the point of being practical if you ca n't find two distressed females a house ? We merely want a small house with large rooms , and plenty of them . "
61624	61642	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Evie , I like that ! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her ! "
61643	61649	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" What 's that , Father ?
61650	61669	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" I want a new home in September , and someone must find it . I ca n't . "
61670	61679	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Percy , do you know of anything ? "
61680	61688	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" I ca n't say I do , "
61693	61704	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" How like you ! You 're never any good . "
61705	61723	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Never any good . Just listen to her ! Never any good . Oh , come ! "
61724	61737	61690	61691	Mr. Cahill	419	" Well , you are n't . Miss Schlegel , is he ? "
61866	61880	61908	61908	She	278	" Right you are ! I 'll cable out to Uganda this evening , "
61887	61900	61908	61908	She	278	" Their Emperor wants war ; well , let him have it , "
61914	61918	61919	61919	she	278	" Next time , "
61925	61939	61919	61919	she	278	" you shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles 's . "
61940	61944	61908	61908	She	278	" With pleasure . "
61945	61953	61954	61954	she	278	" No , you 'd hate it , "
61967	61996	61954	61954	she	278	" It 's all proteids and body - buildings , and people come up to you and beg your pardon , but you have such a beautiful aura . "
61997	62001	61908	61908	She	278	" A what ? "
62002	62029	61954	61954	she	278	" Never heard of an aura ? Oh , happy , happy man ! I scrub at mine for hours . Nor of an astral plane ? "
62041	62080	61908	61908	She	278	" Just so . Luckily it was Helen 's aura , not mine , and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses . I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went . "
62081	62113	61908	61908	She	278	" Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls . No one 's ever asked me about my - what d'ye call it ? Perhaps I 've not got one . "
62114	62137	61908	61908	She	278	" You 're bound to have one , but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it . "
62138	62158	61908	61908	She	278	" Tell me , though , Miss Schlegel , do you really believe in the supernatural and all that ? "
62159	62165	61908	61908	She	278	" Too difficult a question . "
62166	62175	61908	61908	She	278	" Why 's that ? Gruyere or Stilton ? "
62176	62181	61908	61908	She	278	" Gruyere , please . "
62182	62187	61908	61908	She	278	" Better have Stilton . "
62188	62211	61908	61908	She	278	" Stilton . Because , though I do n't believe in auras , and think Theosophy 's only a halfway - house - "
62212	62225	62226	62226	he	2022	" - Yet there may be something in it all the same , "
62233	62276	61908	61908	She	278	" Not even that . It may be halfway in the wrong direction . I ca n't explain . I do n't believe in all these fads , and yet I do n't like saying that I do n't believe in them . "
62284	62307	62277	62277	He	2022	" So you would n't give me your word that you DON'T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it ? "
62308	62312	62314	62314	Margaret	278	" I could , "
62327	62357	62314	62314	Margaret	278	" Indeed , I will . When I talked about scrubbing my aura , I was only trying to be funny . But why do you want this settled ? "
62358	62364	62277	62277	He	2022	" I do n't know . "
62365	62375	62314	62314	Margaret	278	" Now , Mr. Wilcox , you do know . "
62376	62382	62277	62277	He	2022	" Yes , I am , "
62383	62390	62393	62394	the lovers	795	" No , you 're not , "
62410	62416	62277	62277	He	2022	" How 's your house ? "
62417	62429	62277	62277	He	2022	" Much the same as when you honoured it last week . "
62430	62444	62277	62277	He	2022	" I do n't mean Ducie Street . Howards End , of course . "
62445	62452	62277	62277	He	2022	" Why ' of course ' ? "
62453	62472	62277	62277	He	2022	" Ca n't you turn out your tenant and let it to us ? We 're nearly demented . "
62473	62553	62277	62277	He	2022	" Let me think . I wish I could help you . But I thought you wanted to be in town . One bit of advice : fix your district , then fix your price , and then do n't budge . That 's how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton . I said to myself , ' I mean to be exactly here , ' and I was , and Oniton 's a place in a thousand . "
62554	62607	62277	62277	He	2022	" But I do budge . Gentlemen seem to mesmerize houses - cow them with an eye , and up they come , trembling . Ladies ca n't . It 's the houses that are mesmerizing me . I 've no control over the saucy things . Houses are alive . No ? "
62608	62616	62617	62617	he	2024	" I 'm out of my depth , "
62623	62636	62617	62617	he	2024	" Did n't you talk rather like that to your office boy ? "
62637	62664	62277	62277	He	2022	" Did I ? - I mean I did , more or less . I talk the same way to every one - or try to . "
62665	62683	62617	62617	he	2024	" Yes , I know . And how much do you suppose that he understood of it ? "
62684	62803	62277	62277	He	2022	" That 's his lookout . I do n't believe in suiting my conversation to my company . One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough , but it 's no more like the real thing than money is like food . There 's no nourishment in it . You pass it to the lower classes , and they pass it back to you , and this you call ' social intercourse ' or ' mutual endeavour , ' when it 's mutual priggishness if it 's anything . Our friends at Chelsea do n't see this . They say one ought to be at all costs intelligible , and sacrifice - "
62804	62808	62810	62811	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Lower classes , "
62823	62840	62817	62817	his	261	" Well , you do admit that there are rich and poor . That 's something . "
62862	62908	62847	62847	he	261	" You do admit that , if wealth was divided up equally , in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same . The hard - working man would come to the top , the wastrel sink to the bottom . "
62909	62915	62847	62847	he	261	" Every one admits that . "
62916	62922	62847	62847	he	261	" Your Socialists do n't . "
62923	62969	62847	62847	he	261	" My Socialists do . Yours may n't ; but I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists , but ninepins , which you have constructed for your own amusement . I ca n't imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily . "
63006	63028	62997	62997	he	261	" I do n't care . You 've made two damaging admissions , and I 'm heartily with you in both . "
63273	63276	63270	63270	It	2040	" important change "
63458	63469	63439	63439	She	278	" Rubbish , you 're a self - conscious fool ! "
63544	63551	63553	63554	her hostess	1273	" You need n't go though - "
63556	63614	63553	63554	her hostess	1273	" I need n't , but had n't I better ? It 's really getting rather serious . We let chance after chance slip , and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street . We do n't know what we WANT , that 's the mischief with us - "
63615	63624	63626	63626	Helen	268	" No , we have no real ties , "
63633	63686	63553	63554	her hostess	1273	" Sha n't I go up to town today , take the house if it 's the least possible , and then come down by the afternoon train tomorrow , and start enjoying myself . I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind . "
63687	63698	63731	63731	his	262	" But you wo n't do anything rash , Margaret ? "
63699	63707	63553	63554	her hostess	1273	" There 's nothing rash to do . "
63708	63714	63716	63716	Tibby	262	" Who ARE the Wilcoxes ? "
63744	63761	63738	63738	she	2047	" I do n't MANAGE the Wilcoxes ; I do n't see where they come IN . "
63762	63768	63770	63770	Helen	268	" No more do I , "
63772	63823	63770	63770	Helen	268	" It 's funny that we just do n't lose sight of them . Out of all our hotel acquaintances , Mr. Wilcox is the only one who has stuck . It is now over three years , and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time .
63824	63833	63738	63738	she	2047	" Interesting people do n't get one houses . "
63834	63855	63770	63770	Helen	268	" Meg , if you start in your honest - English vein , I shall throw the treacle at you . "
63856	63866	63868	63868	Margaret	278	" It 's a better vein than the cosmopolitan , "
63873	63915	63868	63868	Margaret	278	" Now , children , which is it to be ? You know the Ducie Street house . Shall I say yes or shall I say no ? Tibby love - which ? I 'm specially anxious to pin you both . "
63916	63931	63770	63770	Helen	268	" It all depends what meaning you attach to the word ' possi - ' "
63932	63946	63868	63868	Margaret	278	" It depends on nothing of the sort . Say ' yes . ' "
63947	63953	63770	63770	Helen	268	" Say ' no . ' "
63960	63964	63965	63965	she	278	" I think , "
63968	63998	63965	63965	she	278	" that our race is degenerating . We can not settle even this little thing ; what will it be like when we have to settle a big one ? "
63999	64008	64010	64010	Helen	268	" It will be as easy as eating , "
64012	64098	63868	63868	Margaret	278	" I was thinking of Father . How could he settle to leave Germany as he did , when he had fought for it as a young man , and all his feelings and friends were Prussian ? How could he break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming at something else ? It would have killed me . When he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals - and we , at our age , ca n't change houses . It 's humiliating . "
64099	64110	64112	64113	Mrs. Munt	268	" Your father may have been able to change countries , "
64117	64160	64112	64113	Mrs. Munt	268	" and that may or may not be a good thing . But he could change houses no better than you can , in fact , much worse . Never shall I forget what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester . "
64161	64166	64168	64168	Helen	268	" I knew it , "
64170	64196	64168	64168	Helen	268	" I told you so . It is the little things one bungles at . The big , real ones are nothing when they come . "
64197	64296	64112	64113	Mrs. Munt	268	" Bungle , my dear ! You are too little to recollect - in fact , you were n't there . But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for Wickham Place was signed , and Emily took train with baby - who was Margaret then - and the smaller luggage for London , without so much as knowing where her new home would be . Getting away from that house may be hard , but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it . "
64306	64341	64297	64297	Helen	268	" And that 's the man who beat the Austrians , and the Danes , and the French , and who beat the Germans that were inside himself . And we 're like him . "
64342	64347	64349	64349	Tibby	262	" Speak for yourself , "
64351	64360	64349	64349	Tibby	262	" Remember that I am cosmopolitan , please . "
64361	64367	64297	64297	Helen	268	" Helen may be right . "
64368	64375	64377	64377	Helen	268	" Of course she 's right , "
64480	64482	64479	64479	she	278	" waved "
64595	64631	64584	64584	she	278	" I may have been deceived by the curate , my dear , but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me , and has , as a matter fact - "
64693	64701	64702	64702	she	278	" This is awfully kind of you , "
64705	64729	64702	64702	she	278	" but I 'm afraid it 's not going to do . The house has not been built that suits the Schlegel family . "
64730	64742	64685	64685	he	261	" What ! Have you come up determined not to deal ? "
64743	64747	64702	64702	she	278	" Not exactly . "
64748	64760	64685	64685	he	261	" Not exactly ? In that case let 's be starting . "
64791	64798	64799	64799	she	278	" Presumably it 's very beautiful , "
64802	64811	64799	64799	she	278	" How do you like it , Crane ? "
64812	64820	64822	64823	her host	2059	" Come , let 's be starting , "
64825	64839	64822	64823	her host	2059	" How on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called Crane ? "
64840	64875	64799	64799	she	278	" Why , I know Crane : I 've been for a drive with Evie once . I know that you 've got a parlourmaid called Milton . I know all sorts of things . "
64876	64879	64880	64880	he	2059	" Evie ! "
64886	64954	64880	64880	he	2059	" You wo n't see her . She 's gone out with Cahill . It 's no fun , I can tell you , being left so much alone . I 've got my work all day - indeed , a great deal too much of it - but when I come home in the evening , I tell you , I ca n't stand the house . "
64955	64966	64967	64967	Margaret	278	" In my absurd way , I 'm lonely too , "
64970	65002	64967	64967	Margaret	278	" It 's heart - breaking to leave one 's old home . I scarcely remember anything before Wickham Place , and Helen and Tibby were born there . Helen says - "
65003	65011	64799	64799	she	278	" You , too , feel lonely ? "
65012	65021	64967	64967	Margaret	278	" Horribly . Hullo , Parliament 's back ! "
65038	65046	65048	65048	he	261	" Yes , they are talking again . "
65050	65058	65048	65048	he	261	" But you were going to say - "
65059	65109	64799	64799	she	278	" Only some rubbish about furniture . Helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish , and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas - just imagine it ! - rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them . "
65110	65118	65048	65048	he	261	" Your sister always likes her little joke .
65119	65151	64799	64799	she	278	" She says ' Yes , ' my brother says ' No , ' to Ducie Street . It 's no fun helping us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . "
65152	65168	65048	65048	he	261	" You are not as unpractical as you pretend . I shall never believe it . "
65432	65432	65445	65445	he	261	"
65433	65444	65445	65445	he	261	" At all events you responded to my telegram promptly , "
65448	65462	65445	65445	he	261	" Oh , even I know a good thing when I see it . "
65463	65477	65445	65445	he	261	" I 'm glad you do n't despise the goods of this world . "
65478	65490	65445	65445	he	261	" Heavens , no ! Only idiots and prigs do that . "
65491	65499	65500	65500	he	261	" I am glad , very glad , "
65518	65580	65500	65500	he	261	" There is so much ca nt talked in would - be intellectual circles . I am glad you do n't share it . Self - denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character . But I ca n't stand those people who run down comforts . They have usually some axe to grind . Can you ? "
65581	65588	65590	65590	Margaret	278	" Comforts are of two kinds , "
65599	65629	65590	65590	Margaret	278	" those we can share with others , like fire , weather , or music ; and those we ca n't - food , for instance . It depends . "
65630	65648	65649	65649	He	261	" I mean reasonable comforts , of course . I should n't like to think that you - "
65795	65805	65806	65806	she	278	" I want to go over the whole house , "
65812	65851	65806	65806	she	278	" As soon as I get back to Swanage , which will be tomorrow afternoon , I 'll talk it over once more with Helen and Tibby , and wire you ' yes ' or ' no . ' "
65852	65860	65862	65862	they	2073	" Right . The dining - room . "
66045	66052	66100	66100	them	2088	" Now the entrance - hall . "
66060	66066	66100	66100	them	2088	" Here we fellows smoke . "
66087	66092	66094	66094	Margaret	278	" Oh , jolly ! "
66102	66108	66109	66109	he	4161	" You do like it ? "
66128	66142	66109	66109	he	4161	" It 's all rubbish not making oneself comfortable . Is n't it ? "
66143	66156	66113	66113	his	4161	" Ye - es . Semi - rubbish . Are those Cruikshanks ? "
66157	66166	66109	66109	he	4161	" Gillrays . Shall we go on upstairs ? "
66167	66177	66113	66113	his	4161	" Does all this furniture come from Howards End ? "
66178	66189	66109	66109	he	4161	" The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton . "
66190	66214	66113	66113	his	4161	" Does - However , I 'm concerned with the house , not the furniture . How big is this smoking - room ? "
66215	66232	66109	66109	he	4161	" Thirty by fifteen . No , wait a minute . Fifteen and a half ? . "
66233	66260	66113	66113	his	4161	" Ah , well . Mr. Wilcox , are n't you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses ? "
66367	66370	66372	66372	his	261	" Miss Schlegel "
66377	66401	66372	66372	his	261	" I have had you up on false pretences . I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house . "
66406	66410	66402	66402	Margaret	278	" I know - "
66411	66424	66372	66372	his	261	" Could you be induced to share my - is it probable - "
66425	66431	66432	66432	she	278	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox ! "
66443	66460	66432	66432	she	278	" I see , I see . I will write to you afterwards if I may . "
66466	66477	66461	66461	He	261	" Miss Schlegel - Margaret - you do n't understand . "
66478	66486	66488	66488	Margaret	278	" Oh yes ! Indeed , yes ! "
66490	66500	66510	66510	he	261	" I am asking you to be my wife . "
66513	66523	66510	66510	he	261	" I am asking you to be my wife , "
66618	66627	66643	66643	He	261	" You are n't offended , Miss Schlegel ? "
66628	66635	66643	66643	He	261	" How could I be offended ? "
66716	66721	66722	66722	she	278	" Good - bye , "
66725	66741	66722	66722	she	278	" You will have a letter from me - I am going back to Swanage tomorrow .
66742	66746	66810	66810	She	278	" Thank you . "
66747	66759	66722	66722	she	278	" Good - bye , and it 's you I thank . "
66760	66772	66810	66810	She	278	" I may order the motor round , may n't I ? "
66773	66780	66722	66722	she	278	" That would be most kind . "
66781	66795	66810	66810	She	278	" I wish I had written instead . Ought I to have written ? "
66796	66801	66722	66722	she	278	" Not at all . "
66802	66809	66810	66810	She	278	" There 's just one question - "
66886	66888	66882	66883	those others	2104	" ninnies "
66910	66913	66907	66907	she	278	" loved , "
67034	67046	67031	67031	she	278	" But I 've been through this sort of thing before . "
67097	67106	67089	67089	She	278	" Oh , sir , this is so sudden "
67171	67176	67162	67162	She	278	" Ich liebe dich , "
67839	67856	67824	67825	Mrs. Munt	268	" And your English lakes - Vindermere , Grasmere - are they , then , unhealthy ? "
67857	67905	67824	67825	Mrs. Munt	268	" No , Frau Liesecke ; but that is because they are fresh water , and different . Salt water ought to have tides , and go up and down a great deal , or else it smells . Look , for instance , at an aquarium . "
67906	67944	67824	67825	Mrs. Munt	268	" An aquarium ! Oh , MEESIS Munt , you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt ? Why , when Victor , my brother - in - law , collected many tadpoles - "
67945	67955	67957	67957	Helen	268	" You are not to say ' stink , ' "
67959	67981	67957	67957	Helen	268	" at least , you may say it , but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it . "
67982	68014	67824	67825	Mrs. Munt	268	" Then ' smell . ' And the mud of your Pool down there - does it not smell , or may I say ' stink , ha , ha ' ? "
68015	68025	68027	68028	Mrs. Munt	268	" There always has been mud in Poole Harbour , "
68035	68053	68027	68028	Mrs. Munt	268	" The rivers bring it down , and a most valuable oyster - fishery depends upon it . "
68054	68061	68063	68063	Frieda	295	" Yes , that is so , "
68072	68078	68089	68089	she	2158	" ' Bournemouth is , ' "
68094	68153	68089	68089	she	2158	" ' Bournemouth is , Poole was , and Swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three . ' Now , Frau Liesecke , I have shown you Bournemouth , and I have shown you Poole , so let us walk backward a little , and look down again at Swanage . "
68154	68166	68027	68028	Mrs. Munt	268	" Aunt Juley , would n't that be Meg 's train ? "
68192	68207	68089	68089	she	2158	" Oh , dearest Margaret , I do hope she wo n't be overtired . "
68208	68225	68089	68089	she	2158	" Oh , I do wonder - I do wonder whether she 's taken the house . "
68226	68235	68089	68089	she	2158	" I hope she has n't been hasty . "
68236	68246	68089	68089	she	2158	" So do I - oh , so do I. "
68247	68257	68258	68258	Frieda	295	" Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place ? "
68261	68323	68089	68089	she	2158	" I should think it would . Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud . All those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way , and I ca n't think why he does n't keep on with it . But it 's really for Evie that he went there , and now that Evie 's going to be married - "
68324	68327	68258	68258	Frieda	295	" Ah ! "
68328	68344	68089	68089	she	2158	" You 've never seen Miss Wilcox , Frieda . How absurdly matrimonial you are ! "
68345	68352	68258	68258	Frieda	295	" But sister to that Paul ? "
68353	68356	68089	68089	she	2158	" Yes . "
68357	68363	68365	68366	Mrs. Munt	268	" And to that Charles , "
68370	68383	68365	68366	Mrs. Munt	268	" Oh , Helen , Helen , what a time that was ! "
68387	68413	68384	68384	Helen	268	" Meg and I have n't got such tender hearts . If there 's a chance of a cheap house , we go for it . "
68414	68493	68089	68089	she	2158	" Now look , Frau Liesecke , at my niece 's train . You see , it is coming towards us - coming , coming ; and , when it gets to Corfe , it will actually go THROUGH the downs , on which we are standing , so that , if we walk over , as I suggested , and look down on Swanage , we shall see it coming on the other side . Shall we ? "
68614	68618	68620	68620	Helen	268	" You see , "
68625	68745	68620	68620	Helen	268	" the Wilcoxes collect houses as your Victor collects tadpoles . They have , one , Ducie Street ; two , Howards End , where my great rumpus was ; three , a country seat in Shropshire ; four , Charles has a house in Hilton ; and five , another near Epsom ; and six , Evie will have a house when she marries , and probably a pied - a - terre in the country - which makes seven . Oh yes , and Paul a hut in Africa makes eight . I wish we could get Howards End . That was something like a dear little house ! Did n't you think so , Aunt Juley ? "
68746	68761	68763	68764	Mrs. Munt	268	" I had too much to do , dear , to look at it , "
68771	68808	68763	68764	Mrs. Munt	268	" I had everything to settle and explain , and Charles Wilcox to keep in his place besides . It is n't likely I should remember much . I just remember having lunch in your bedroom . "
68809	68863	68620	68620	Helen	268	" Yes so do I. But , oh dear , dear , how dead it all seems ! And in the autumn there began this anti - Pauline movement - you , and Frieda , and Meg , and Mrs. Wilcox , all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry Paul . "
68864	68869	68871	68871	Frieda	295	" You yet may , "
68879	68899	68874	68874	Helen	268	" The Great Wilcox Peril will never return . If I 'm certain of anything it 's of that . "
68900	68915	68874	68874	Helen	268	" One is certain of nothing but the truth of one 's own emotions . "
69059	69062	69064	69065	Aunt Juley	267	" Look ! "
69079	69103	69064	69065	Aunt Juley	267	" Stand where I stand , and you will see the pony - cart coming . I see the pony - cart coming . "
69146	69153	69154	69154	they	2177	" Have you got the house ? "
69193	69200	69164	69164	Helen	268	" Have you got the house ? "
69206	69220	69203	69203	her	278	" Oh , what a nuisance ! So we 're as we were ? "
69221	69225	69201	69201	Margaret	278	" Not exactly . "
69233	69237	69239	69239	Tibby	262	" Some mystery , "
69241	69249	69239	69239	Tibby	262	" We are to be enlightened presently . "
69292	69300	69301	69301	she	278	" It 's just like a widower , "
69304	69323	69301	69301	she	278	" They 've cheek enough for anything , and invariably select one of their first wife 's friends . "
69330	69334	69335	69335	She	278	" That type - "
69342	69351	69335	69335	She	278	" Meg , not anything wrong with you ? "
69352	69357	69359	69359	Margaret	278	" Wait one minute , "
69364	69375	69376	69376	She	278	" But you 've never conceivably - you 've never - "
69381	69429	69376	69376	She	278	" Tibby , hurry up through ; I ca n't hold this gate indefinitely . Aunt Juley ! I say , Aunt Juley , make the tea , will you , and Frieda ; we 've got to talk houses , and I 'll come on afterwards . "
69455	69460	69452	69452	herself	278	" Oh , really - "
69471	69475	69477	69477	Helen	268	" Do n't , "
69479	69491	69492	69492	She	268	" do n't , do n't , Meg , do n't ! "
69524	69550	69504	69504	herself	278	" Do n't , do n't do such a thing ! I tell you not to - do n't ! I know - do n't ! "
69551	69557	69504	69504	herself	278	" What do you know ? "
69558	69563	69565	69565	Helen	268	" Panic and emptiness , "
69567	69571	69565	69565	Helen	268	" Do n't ! "
69576	69602	69573	69573	Margaret	278	" Helen is a little selfish . I have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying . She said : "
69615	69615	69573	69573	Margaret	278	"
69616	69625	69627	69627	Helen	268	" It 's not a thing like that , "
69648	69655	69657	69657	Margaret	278	" What 's happened to you ? "
69674	69680	69657	69657	Margaret	278	" But it 's stupid ! "
69699	69702	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Meg - "
69703	69716	69718	69718	Margaret	278	" I do n't know what 's happened to either of us , "
69724	69732	69718	69718	Margaret	278	" We must both have gone mad . "
69745	69752	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Look here , sit down . "
69753	69767	69695	69695	Helen	268	" All right ; I 'll sit down if you 'll sit down . "
69768	69783	69695	69695	Helen	268	" There . One kiss . Now , whatever , whatever is the matter ? "
69784	69800	69695	69695	Helen	268	" I do mean what I said . Do n't ; it would n't do . "
69801	69847	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Oh , Helen , stop saying ' do n't ' ! It 's ignorant . It 's as if your head was n't out of the slime . ' Do n't ' is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the day to Mr. Bast . "
69852	69855	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Well ? "
69856	69877	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Tell me about it first , and meanwhile perhaps I 'll have got my head out of the slime . "
69878	70064	69695	69695	Helen	268	" That 's better . Well , where shall I begin ? When I arrived at Waterloo - no , I 'll go back before that , because I 'm anxious you should know everything from the first . The ' first ' was about ten days ago . It was the day Mr. Bast came to tea and lost his temper . I was defending him , and Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me , however slightly . I thought it was the involuntary thing , which men ca n't help any more than we can . You know - at least , I know in my own case - when a man has said to me , ' So - and - so 's a pretty girl , ' I am seized with a momentary sourness against So - and - so , and long to tweak her ear . It 's a tiresome feeling , but not an important one , and one easily manages it . But it was n't only this in Mr. Wilcox 's case , I gather now . "
70065	70071	69695	69695	Helen	268	" Then you love him ? "
70075	70088	70089	70089	she	278	" It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you , "
70092	70115	70089	70089	she	278	" The mere fact of that grows more tremendous . Remember , I 've known and liked him steadily for nearly three years .
70116	70121	70149	70149	her	278	" But loved him ? "
70184	70187	70177	70177	she	278	" No . "
70188	70193	70177	70177	she	278	" But you will ? "
70194	70197	70199	70199	Margaret	278	" Yes , "
70201	70220	70199	70199	Margaret	278	" of that I 'm pretty sure . Indeed , I began the moment he spoke to me . "
70221	70229	70177	70177	she	278	" And have settled to marry him ? "
70230	70258	70199	70199	Margaret	278	" I had , but am wanting a long talk about it now . What is it against him , Helen ? You must try and say . "
70268	70275	70276	70276	she	268	" It is ever since Paul , "
70280	70291	70177	70177	she	278	" But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul ? "
70292	70360	70262	70262	her	268	" But he was there , they were all there that morning when I came down to breakfast , and saw that Paul was frightened - the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen , so that I knew it was impossible , because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever , and not this outer life of telegrams and anger . "
70387	70508	70510	70510	she	268	" That 's foolish . In the first place , I disagree about the outer life . Well , we 've often argued that . The real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love - making and yours . Yours - was romance ; mine will be prose . I 'm not running it down - a very good kind of prose , but well considered , well thought out . For instance , I know all Mr. Wilcox 's faults . He 's afraid of emotion . He cares too much about success , too little about the past . His sympathy lacks poetry , and so is n't sympathy really . I 'd even say "
70517	70537	70510	70510	she	268	" that , spiritually , he 's not as honest as I am . Does n't that satisfy you ? "
70538	70545	70547	70547	Helen	268	" No , it does n't , "
70549	70563	70547	70547	Helen	268	" It makes me feel worse and worse . You must be mad . "
70571	70614	70564	70564	Margaret	278	" I do n't intend him , or any man or any woman , to be all my life - good heavens , no ! There are heaps of things in me that he does n't , and shall never , understand . "
70719	70724	70725	70725	she	268	" So with him , "
70728	70767	70725	70725	she	268	" There are heaps of things in him - more especially things that he does - that will always be hidden from me . He has all those public qualities which you so despise and enable all this - "
70780	70877	70768	70768	She	268	" If Wilcoxes had n't worked and died in England for thousands of years , you and I could n't sit here without having our throats cut . There would be no trains , no ships to carry us literary people about in , no fields even . Just savagery . No - perhaps not even that . Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm . More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it . There are times when it seems to me - "
70878	70893	70770	70770	her	268	" And to me , and to all women . So one kissed Paul . "
70894	70899	70901	70901	Margaret	278	" That 's brutal , "
70903	70917	70901	70901	Margaret	278	" Mine is an absolutely different case . I 've thought things out . "
70918	70933	70770	70770	her	268	" It makes no difference thinking things out . They come to the same . "
70934	70937	70901	70901	Margaret	278	" Rubbish ! "
70953	70959	70961	70961	Helen	268	" One would lose something , "
71327	71333	71334	71334	they	2222	" Men did produce this , "
71756	71773	71753	71753	she	278	" Do you remember the Embankment at Chelsea ? It ca n't be ten days ago . "
71774	71777	71778	71778	he	360	" Yes , "
71783	71802	71778	71778	he	360	" And you and your sister were head and ears deep in some Quixotic scheme . Ah well ! "
71803	71814	71753	71753	she	278	" I little thought then , certainly . Did you ? "
71815	71830	71778	71778	he	360	" I do n't know about that ; I should n't like to say . "
71831	71838	71839	71839	she	278	" Why , was it earlier ? "
71842	71861	71839	71839	she	278	" Did you think of me this way earlier ! How extraordinarily interesting , Henry ! Tell me . "
71897	71900	71892	71892	He	360	" interesting , "
71918	71926	71927	71927	she	278	" I did n't think of it , "
71930	72009	71927	71927	she	278	" No ; when you spoke to me in the drawing - room , that was practically the first . It was all so different from what it 's supposed to be . On the stage , or in books , a proposal is - how shall I put it ? - a full - blown affair , a kind of bouquet ; it loses its literal meaning . But in life a proposal really is a proposal - "
72010	72015	71892	71892	He	360	" By the way - "
72016	72024	72025	72025	she	278	" - a suggestion , a seed , "
72036	72067	71892	71892	He	360	" I was thinking , if you did n't mind , that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk ; there will be so much to settle . "
72068	72090	71892	71892	He	360	" I think so too . Tell me , in the first place , how did you get on with Tibby ? "
72091	72096	71892	71892	He	360	" With your brother ? "
72097	72103	71892	71892	He	360	" Yes , during cigarettes . "
72104	72110	71892	71892	He	360	" Oh , very well . "
72111	72117	72118	72118	she	278	" I am so glad , "
72125	72136	72118	72118	she	278	" What did you talk about ? Me , presumably . "
72137	72142	71892	71892	He	360	" About Greece too . "
72143	72174	72118	72118	she	278	" Greece was a very good card , Henry . Tibby 's only a boy still , and one has to pick and choose subjects a little . Well done . "
72175	72190	71892	71892	He	360	" I was telling him I have shares in a currant - farm near Calamata .
72191	72210	72118	72118	she	278	" What a delightful thing to have shares in ! Ca n't we go there for our honeymoon ? "
72211	72216	71892	71892	He	360	" What to do ? "
72217	72230	72118	72118	she	278	" To eat the currants . And is n't there marvellous scenery ? "
72231	72251	71892	71892	He	360	" Moderately , but it 's not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady . "
72252	72256	72118	72118	she	278	" Why not ? "
72257	72261	71892	71892	He	360	" No hotels . "
72262	72290	72118	72118	she	278	" Some ladies do without hotels . Are you aware that Helen and I have walked alone over the Apennines , with our luggage on our backs ? "
72291	72314	71892	71892	He	360	" I was n't aware , and , if I can manage it , you will never do such a thing again . "
72320	72336	72315	72315	She	2248	" You have n't found time for a talk with Helen yet , I suppose ? "
72337	72340	72315	72315	She	2248	" No . "
72341	72358	72315	72315	She	2248	" Do , before you go . I am so anxious you two should be friends . "
72359	72370	72371	72371	he	2249	" Your sister and I have always hit it off , "
72375	72403	72371	72371	he	2249	" But we 're drifting away from our business . Let me begin at the beginning . You know that Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill . "
72404	72409	72315	72315	She	2248	" Dolly 's uncle . "
72410	72497	72371	72371	he	2249	" Exactly . The girl 's madly in love with him . A very good sort of fellow , but he demands - and rightly - a suitable provision with her . And in the second place , you will naturally understand , there is Charles . Before leaving town , I wrote Charles a very careful letter . You see , he has an increasing family and increasing expenses , and the I. and W. A. is nothing particular just now , though capable of development .
72498	72502	72504	72504	Margaret	278	" Poor fellow ! "
72515	72547	72371	72371	he	2249	" Charles being the elder son , some day Charles will have Howards End ; but I am anxious , in my own happiness , not to be unjust to others . "
72548	72553	72554	72554	she	278	" Of course not , "
72564	72578	72554	72554	she	278	" You mean money . How stupid I am ! Of course not ! "
72590	72632	72582	72582	he	2251	" Yes . Money , since you put it so frankly . I am determined to be just to all - just to you , just to them . I am determined that my children shall have no case against me . "
72633	72639	72640	72640	she	278	" Be generous to them , "
72644	72648	72640	72640	she	278	" Bother justice ! "
72649	72664	72582	72582	he	2251	" I am determined - and have already written to Charles to that effect - "
72665	72673	72640	72640	she	278	" But how much have you got ? "
72674	72677	72582	72582	he	2251	" What ? "
72678	72691	72640	72640	she	278	" How much have you a year ? I 've six hundred . "
72692	72696	72582	72582	he	2251	" My income ? "
72697	72730	72640	72640	she	278	" Yes . We must begin with how much you have , before we can settle how much you can give Charles . Justice , and even generosity , depend on that . "
72731	72742	72743	72743	he	2252	" I must say you 're a downright young woman , "
72754	72764	72743	72743	he	2252	" What a question to spring on a fellow ! "
72765	72783	72640	72640	she	278	" Do n't you know your income ? Or do n't you want to tell it me ? "
72784	72787	72743	72743	he	2252	" I - "
72788	72793	72796	72796	she	278	" That 's all right "
72800	72850	72796	72796	she	278	" do n't tell me . I do n't want to know . I can do the sum just as well by proportion . Divide your income into ten parts . How many parts would you give to Evie , how many to Charles , how many to Paul ? "
72851	72907	72743	72743	he	2252	" The fact is , my dear , I had n't any intention of bothering you with details . I only wanted to let you know that - well , that something must be done for the others , and you 've understood me perfectly , so let 's pass on to the next point . "
72908	72916	72918	72918	Margaret	278	" Yes , we 've settled that , "
72926	72959	72918	72918	Margaret	278	" Go ahead ; give away all you can , bearing in mind I 've a clear six hundred . What a mercy it is to have all this money about one ! "
72960	72977	72743	72743	he	2252	" We 've none too much , I assure you ; you 're marrying a poor man .
72978	72987	72988	72988	she	278	" Helen would n't agree with me here , "
72991	73087	72988	72988	she	278	" Helen dare n't slang the rich , being rich herself , but she would like to . There 's an odd notion , that I have n't yet got hold of , running about at the back of her brain , that poverty is somehow ' real . ' She dislikes all organization , and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth . Sovereigns in a stocking would n't bother her ; cheques do . Helen is too relentless . One ca n't deal in her high - handed manner with the world . "
73088	73122	73145	73145	her	278	" There 's this other point , and then I must go back to my hotel and write some letters . What 's to be done now about the house in Ducie Street ? "
73123	73142	72988	72988	she	278	" Keep it on - at least , it depends . When do you want to marry me ? "
73167	73175	73145	73145	her	278	" Getting a bit hot , eh ? "
73189	73193	73179	73180	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I say ! "
73198	73210	73211	73211	They	2253	" Take care I do n't report you to the police . "
73253	73271	73250	73250	he	261	" Evie will probably be married in September . We could scarcely think of anything before then . "
73272	73295	73239	73239	his	261	" The earlier the nicer , Henry . Females are not supposed to say such things , but the earlier the nicer . "
73296	73304	73305	73305	he	261	" How about September for us too ? "
73311	73378	73250	73250	he	261	" Right . Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September ? Or shall we try to bounce Helen and Tibby into it ? That 's rather an idea . They are so unbusinesslike , we could make them do anything by judicious management . Look here - yes . We 'll do that . And we ourselves could live at Howards End or Shropshire . "
73385	73488	73379	73379	He	261	" Heavens ! how you women do fly round ! My head 's in a whirl . Point by point , Margaret . Howards End 's impossible . I let it to Hamar Bryce on a three years ' agreement last March . Do n't you remember ? Oniton . Well , that is much , much too far away to rely on entirely . You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount , but we must have a house within easy reach of Town . Only Ducie Street has huge drawbacks . There 's a mews behind . "
73672	73720	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" Yes , in summer especially , the mews is a serious nuisance . The smoking room , too , is an abominable little den . The house opposite has been taken by operatic people . Ducie Street 's going down , it 's my private opinion . "
73721	73738	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" How sad ! It 's only a few years since they built those pretty houses . "
73739	73749	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" Shows things are moving . Good for trade . "
73750	73813	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" I hate this continual flux of London . It is an epitome of us at our worst - eternal formlessness ; all the qualities , good , bad , and indifferent , streaming away - streaming , streaming for ever . That 's why I dread it so . I mistrust rivers , even in scenery . Now , the sea - "
73814	73820	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" High tide , yes . "
73821	73824	73827	73829	the promenading youths	2261	" Hoy toid "
73831	73844	73846	73847	Mr. Wilcox	261	" And these are the men to whom we give the vote , "
73877	73893	73897	73897	he	261	" However , they have their own lives and interests . Let 's get on . "
73949	73963	73937	73937	She	2266	" A nice beginning , if your aunt saw you slip in alone ! "
73964	74004	73937	73937	She	2266	" But I always do go about alone . Considering I 've walked over the Apennines , it 's common sense . You will make me so angry . I do n't the least take it as a compliment . "
74013	74046	74005	74005	He	261	" It is n't meant as a compliment , my dear . I just wo n't have you going about in the dark . Such people about too ! It 's dangerous . "
74047	74059	73937	73937	She	2266	" Ca n't I look after myself ? I do wish - "
74060	74069	74005	74005	He	261	" Come along , Margaret ; no wheedling . "
74167	74175	74166	74166	her	278	" as clever as they make 'em , "
74273	74275	74264	74265	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Margaret "
74487	74530	74477	74477	her	278	" You 've woken the baby . I knew you would . Rum - ti - foo , Rackety - tackety Tompkin ! I 'm not responsible for what Uncle Percy does , nor for anybody else or anything , so there ! "
74531	74560	74477	74477	her	278	" Who asked him while I was away ? Who asked my sister down to meet him ? Who sent them out in the motor day after day ? "
74561	74571	74477	74477	her	278	" Charles , that reminds me of some poem . "
74572	74598	74477	74477	her	278	" Does it indeed ? We shall all be dancing to a very different music presently . Miss Schlegel has fairly got us on toast . "
74599	74621	74477	74477	her	278	" I could simply scratch that woman 's eyes out , and to say it 's my fault is most unfair . "
74622	74636	74477	74477	her	278	" It 's your fault , and five months ago you admitted it . "
74637	74642	74477	74477	her	278	" I did n't . "
74643	74647	74477	74477	her	278	" You did . "
74648	74658	74660	74660	Dolly	348	" Tootle , tootle , playing on the pootle ! "
74669	74715	74664	74664	herself	348	" It 's all very well to turn the conversation , but Father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as Evie was there to make him comfortable . But you must needs start match - making . Besides , Cahill 's too old . "
74716	74731	74477	74477	her	278	" Of course , if you 're going to be rude to Uncle Percy - "
74732	74755	74664	74664	herself	348	" Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of Howards End , and , thanks to you , she 's got it . "
74756	74791	74477	74477	her	278	" I call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair . You could n't have been nastier if you 'd caught me flirting . Could he , diddums ? "
74792	74925	74664	74664	herself	348	" We 're in a bad hole , and must make the best of it . I shall answer the pater 's letter civilly . He 's evidently anxious to do the decent thing . But I do not intend to forget these Schlegels in a hurry . As long as they 're on their best behaviour - Dolly , are you listening ? - we 'll behave , too . But if I find them giving themselves airs , or monopolizing my father , or at all ill - treating him , or worrying him with their artistic beastliness , I intend to put my foot down , yes , firmly . Taking my mother 's place ! Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the news reaches him . "
75153	75166	75148	75148	he	2289	" I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside . "
75307	75313	75296	75296	he	2289	" Amabat , amare timebat . "
75447	75450	75467	75467	she	278	" talking . "
75582	75603	75572	75572	He	360	" My motto is Concentrate . I 've no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing . "
75604	75613	75614	75614	she	278	" It is n't frittering away the strength , "
75617	75630	75631	75631	He	360	" It 's enlarging the space in which you may be strong . "
75634	75648	75631	75631	He	360	" You 're a clever little woman , but my motto 's Concentrate . "
75699	75705	75706	75706	she	278	" Here we all are ! "
75724	75735	75706	75706	she	278	" Here we are . Good - morning , Helen . "
75739	75747	75736	75736	Helen	268	" Good - morning , Mr. Wilcox . "
75748	75785	75818	75818	she	278	" Henry , she has had such a nice letter from the queer , cross boy - Do you remember him ? He had a sad moustache , but the back of his head was young . "
75786	75808	75736	75736	Helen	268	" I have had a letter too . Not a nice one - I want to talk it over with you : "
75834	75848	75736	75736	Helen	268	" Thanks to your hint , he 's clearing out of the Porphyrion . "
75849	75857	75858	75858	he	360	" Not a bad business that Porphyrion , "
75873	75878	75879	75879	she	278	" Not a BAD - "
75886	75893	75879	75879	she	278	" Surely , on Chelsea Embankment - "
75894	75928	75736	75736	Helen	268	" Here 's our hostess . Good - morning , Mrs. Munt . Fine rhododendrons . Good morning , Frau Liesecke ; we manage to grow flowers in England , do n't we ? "
75929	75935	75879	75879	she	278	" Not a BAD business ? "
75936	76020	75736	75736	Helen	268	" No . My letter 's about Howards End . Bryce has been ordered abroad , and wants to sublet it . I am far from sure that I shall give him permission . There was no clause in the agreement . In my opinion , subletting is a mistake . If he can find me another tenant , whom I consider suitable , I may cancel the agreement . Morning , Schlegel . Do n't you think that 's better than subletting ? "
76104	76115	76147	76147	he	2309	" When there is a sublet I find that damage - "
76116	76140	76141	76141	Her	268	" Do excuse me , but about the Porphyrion . I do n't feel easy - might I just bother you , Henry ? "
76160	76207	76141	76141	Her	268	" You said on Chelsea Embankment , surely , that it was a bad concern , so we advised this clerk to clear out . He writes this morning that he 's taken our advice , and now you say it 's not a bad concern . "
76208	76242	76141	76141	Her	268	" A clerk who clears out of any concern , good or bad , without securing a berth somewhere else first , is a fool , and I 've no pity for him . "
76243	76287	76141	76141	Her	268	" He has not done that . He 's going into a bank in Camden Town , he says . The salary 's much lower , but he hopes to manage - a branch of Dempster 's Bank . Is that all right ? "
76288	76297	76141	76141	Her	268	" Dempster ! My goodness me , yes . "
76298	76305	76141	76141	Her	268	" More right than the Porphyrion ? "
76306	76319	76141	76141	Her	268	" Yes , yes , yes ; safe as houses - safer . "
76320	76334	76141	76141	Her	268	" Very many thanks . I 'm sorry - if you sublet - ? "
76335	76425	76141	76141	Her	268	" If he sublets , I sha n't have the same control . In theory there should be no more damage done at Howards End ; in practice there will be . Things may be done for which no money can compensate . For instance , I should n't want that fine wych - elm spoilt . It hangs - Margaret , we must go and see the old place some time . It 's pretty in its way . We 'll motor down and have lunch with Charles . "
76426	76432	76434	76434	Margaret	278	" I should enjoy that , "
76437	76443	76141	76141	Her	268	" What about next Wednesday ? "
76444	76468	76141	76141	Her	268	" Wednesday ? No , I could n't well do that . Aunt Juley expects us to stop here another week at least . "
76469	76478	76141	76141	Her	268	" But you can give that up now . "
76479	76484	76486	76486	Margaret	278	" Er - no , "
76494	76509	76141	76141	Her	268	" Oh , that 'll be all right . I 'll speak to her . "
76510	76577	76141	76141	Her	268	" This visit is a high solemnity . My aunt counts on it year after year . She turns the house upside down for us ; she invites our special friends - she scarcely knows Frieda , and we ca n't leave her on her hands . I missed one day , and she would be so hurt if I did n't stay the full ten . "
76578	76593	76141	76141	Her	268	" But I 'll say a word to her . Do n't you bother . "
76594	76607	76141	76141	Her	268	" Henry , I wo n't go . Do n't bully me . "
76608	76618	76141	76141	Her	268	" You want to see the house , though ? "
76619	76649	76141	76141	Her	268	" Very much - I 've heard so much about it , one way or the other . Are n't there pigs ' teeth in the wych - elm ? "
76650	76655	76141	76141	Her	268	" PIGS ' TEETH ? "
76656	76665	76141	76141	Her	268	" And you chew the bark for toothache . "
76666	76676	76141	76141	Her	268	" What a rum notion ! Of course not ! "
76677	76703	76141	76141	Her	268	" Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree . There are still a great number of sacred trees in England , it seems . "
76729	76739	76740	76740	she	2319	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox , about the Porphyrion - "
76751	76757	76759	76759	Margaret	278	" It 's all right , "
76765	76772	76759	76759	Margaret	278	" Dempster 's Bank 's better . "
76773	76791	76727	76727	Helen	268	" But I think you told us the Porphyrion was bad , and would smash before Christmas . "
76792	76821	76759	76759	Margaret	278	" Did I ? It was still outside the Tariff Ring , and had to take rotten policies . Lately it came in - safe as houses now . "
76822	76835	76727	76727	Helen	268	" In other words , Mr. Bast need never have left it . "
76836	76844	76759	76759	Margaret	278	" No , the fellow need n't . "
76845	76860	76727	76727	Helen	268	" - and need n't have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary . "
76861	76869	76871	76871	Margaret	278	" He only says ' reduced , ' "
76877	76897	76727	76727	Helen	268	" With a man so poor , every reduction must be great . I consider it a deplorable misfortune . "
76922	76937	76919	76919	him	261	" What ? What 's that ? Do you mean that I 'm responsible ? "
76938	76945	76727	76727	Helen	268	" You 're ridiculous , Helen . "
76946	76952	76953	76953	He	261	" You seem to think - "
76959	77057	76953	76953	He	261	" Let me explain the point to you . It is like this . You seem to assume , when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation , it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage . The Porphyrion , according to you , was bound to say , ' I am trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring . I am not sure that I shall succeed , but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency , and I am trying . ' My dear Helen - "
77058	77077	76727	76727	Helen	268	" Is that your point ? A man who had little money has less - that 's mine . "
77078	77105	76953	76953	He	261	" I am grieved for your clerk . But it is all in the day 's work . It 's part of the battle of life . "
77106	77114	77115	77115	she	2321	" A man who had little money , "
77118	77143	77115	77115	she	2321	" has less , owing to us . Under these circumstances I do not consider ' the battle of life ' a happy expression . "
77144	77150	77151	77151	he	2322	" Oh come , come ! "
77155	77168	77151	77151	he	2322	" You 're not to blame . No one 's to blame . "
77169	77178	76953	76953	He	261	" Is no one to blame for anything ? "
77179	77200	77151	77151	he	2322	" I would n't say that , but you 're taking it far too seriously . Who is this fellow ? "
77201	77212	77214	77214	Helen	268	" We have told you about the fellow twice already , "
77216	77270	77214	77214	Helen	268	" You have even met the fellow . He is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile . He is capable of better things . We - we , the upper classes - thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge - and here 's the result ! "
77276	77284	77271	77271	He	2323	" Now , a word of advice . "
77285	77292	77151	77151	he	2322	" I require no more advice . "
77293	77417	77271	77271	He	2323	" A word of advice . Do n't take up that sentimental attitude over the poor . See that she does n't , Margaret . The poor are poor , and one 's sorry for them , but there it is . As civilization moves forward , the shoe is bound to pinch in places , and it 's absurd to pretend that anyone is responsible personally . Neither you , nor I , nor my informant , nor the man who informed him , nor the directors of the Porphyrion , are to blame for this clerk 's loss of salary . It 's just the shoe pinching - no one can help it ; and it might easily have been worse . "
77423	77516	77151	77151	he	2322	" By all means subscribe to charities - subscribe to them largely - but do n't get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform . I see a good deal behind the scenes , and you can take it from me that there is no Social Question - except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase . There are just rich and poor , as there always have been and always will be . Point me out a time when men have been equal - "
77517	77523	77573	77573	his	2324	" I did n't say - "
77524	77572	77151	77151	he	2322	" Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier . No , no . You ca n't . There always have been rich and poor . I 'm no fatalist . Heaven forbid ! But our civilization is moulded by great impersonal forces "
77587	77602	77582	77582	he	2324	" and there always will be rich and poor . You ca n't deny it "
77611	77635	77582	77582	he	2324	" and you ca n't deny that , in spite of all , the tendency of civilization has on the whole been upward . "
77636	77644	77646	77646	Helen	268	" Owing to God , I suppose , "
77653	77664	77648	77648	He	2324	" You grab the dollars . God does the rest . "
77705	77713	77702	77702	He	2324	" She rather reminds me of Dolly . "
77721	77731	77733	77734	her sister	566	" Do n't even discuss political economy with Henry , "
77736	77745	77733	77734	her sister	566	" It 'll only end in a cry . "
77746	77762	77764	77764	Helen	268	" But he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion , "
77767	77857	77764	77764	Helen	268	" I do n't like those men . They are scientific themselves , and talk of the survival of the fittest , and cut down the salaries of their clerks , and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort , but yet they believe that somehow good - and it is always that sloppy ' somehow ' - will be the outcome , and that in some mystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the Mr. Basts of today are in pain . "
77858	77875	77959	77959	She	278	" He is such a man in theory . But oh , Helen , in theory ! "
77876	77886	77764	77764	Helen	268	" But oh , Meg , what a theory ! "
77887	77898	77959	77959	She	278	" Why should you put things so bitterly , dearie ? "
77899	77907	77909	77909	Helen	268	" Because I 'm an old maid , "
77915	77928	77929	77929	She	268	" I ca n't think why I go on like this myself . "
77999	78002	78003	78004	her aunt	635	" Margaret ! "
78007	78032	78003	78004	her aunt	635	" Magsy ! It is n't true , surely , what Mr. Wilcox says , that you want to go away early next week ? "
78033	78039	78041	78041	Margaret	278	" Not ' want , ' "
78046	78066	78041	78041	Margaret	278	" but there is so much to be settled , and I do want to see the Charles ' . "
78067	78082	78084	78085	Mrs. Munt	268	" But going away without taking the Weymouth trip , or even the Lulworth ? "
78090	78100	78084	78085	Mrs. Munt	268	" Without going once more up Nine Barrows Down ? "
78101	78107	78041	78041	Margaret	278	" I 'm afraid so . "
78114	78125	78108	78109	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Good ! I did the breaking of the ice . "
78220	78223	78224	78224	she	268	" Yes , "
78235	78262	78224	78224	she	268	" there is a mystery . I ca n't help it . It 's not my fault . It 's the way life has been made . "
78341	78365	78366	78366	Margaret	278	" Go on and marry him . I think you 're splendid ; and if anyone can pull it off , you will . "
78373	78377	78379	78379	she	278	" pull off , "
78382	78511	78379	78379	she	278	" Yes , there is , and I was n't up to it with Paul . I can only do what 's easy . I can only entice and be enticed . I ca n't , and wo n't attempt difficult relations . If I marry , it will either be a man who 's strong enough to boss me or whom I 'm strong enough to boss . So I sha n't ever marry , for there are n't such men . And Heaven help any one whom I do marry , for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say ' Jack Robinson . ' There ! Because I 'm uneducated . But you , you 're different ; you 're a heroine . "
78512	78532	78379	78379	she	278	" Oh , Helen ! Am I ? Will it be as dreadful for poor Henry as all that ? "
78533	78723	78379	78379	she	278	" You mean to keep proportion , and that 's heroic , it 's Greek , and I do n't see why it should n't succeed with you . Go on and fight with him and help him . Do n't ask ME for help , or even for sympathy . Henceforward I 'm going my own way . I mean to be thorough , because thoroughness is easy . I mean to dislike your husband , and to tell him so . I mean to make no concessions to Tibby . If Tibby wants to live with me , he must lump me . I mean to love YOU more than ever . Yes , I do . You and I have built up something real , because it is purely spiritual . There 's no veil of mystery over us . Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body . The popular view is , as usual , exactly the wrong one . Our bothers are over tangible things - money , husbands , house - hunting . But Heaven will work of itself . "
78736	78739	78724	78724	Margaret	278	" Perhaps . "
78848	78862	78863	78864	Aunt Juley	267	" Yes , I see , dear ; it 's about halfway between , "
78966	78980	78982	78982	Helen	268	" I definitely dislike him , but I 'll do what I can , "
78984	78995	78982	78982	Helen	268	" Do what you can with my friends in return . "
79041	79044	78999	78999	Margaret	278	" pays , "
79312	79370	79301	79301	Henry	360	" letter . She might have been at the Porphyrion , or Dempster 's Bank , or her own wine - merchant 's . Everything seems just alike in these days . But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial side of the company rather than its West African , and Imperialism always had been one of her difficulties .
79371	79375	79377	79378	Mr. Wilcox	261	" One minute ! "
79429	79449	79451	79451	his	261	" I hope that my wife - how do you do ? - will give you a decent lunch , "
79454	79520	79451	79451	his	261	" I left instructions , but we live in a rough - and - ready way . She expects you back to tea , too , after you have had a look at Howards End . I wonder what you 'll think of the place . I would n't touch it with tongs myself . Do sit down ! It 's a measly little place . "
79521	79528	79530	79530	Margaret	278	" I shall enjoy seeing it , "
79541	79589	79451	79451	his	261	" You 'll see it at its worst , for Bryce decamped abroad last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him . I never saw such a disgraceful mess . It 's unbelievable . He was n't in the house a month . "
79590	79603	79605	79605	Henry	360	" I 've more than a little bone to pick with Bryce , "
79611	79619	79451	79451	his	261	" Why did he go so suddenly ? "
79620	79628	79451	79451	his	261	" Invalid type ; could n't sleep . "
79629	79633	79451	79451	his	261	" Poor fellow ! "
79634	79638	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Poor fiddlesticks ! "
79646	79675	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" He had the impudence to put up notice - boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave . Charles flung them down . "
79676	79684	79686	79686	Charles	261	" Yes , I flung them down , "
79689	79726	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I 've sent a telegram after him , and a pretty sharp one , too . He , and he in person is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years . "
79727	79742	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" The keys are at the farm ; we would n't have the keys . "
79743	79747	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Quite right . "
79748	79762	79640	79641	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Dolly would have taken them , but I was in , fortunately . "
79763	79770	79772	79772	Margaret	278	" What 's Mr. Bryce like ? "
79830	79837	79839	79839	he	261	" Now we 'll be off , "
80106	80112	80114	80115	Mr. Wilcox	261	" They 're all right , "
80117	80131	80114	80115	Mr. Wilcox	261	" They 'll learn - like the swallows and the telegraph - wires . "
80132	80142	80193	80193	She	278	" Yes , but , while they 're learning - "
80143	80151	80152	80152	he	1541	" The motor 's come to stay , "
80155	80192	80152	80152	he	1541	" One must get about . There 's a pretty church - oh , you are n't sharp enough . Well , look out , if the road worries you - right outward at the scenery . "
80471	80480	80482	80483	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Kiss them now , and come away , "
80567	80572	80574	80574	Margaret	278	" What 's happened ? "
80576	80582	80584	80584	Henry	360	" What do you suppose ? "
80596	80602	80574	80574	Margaret	278	" Are we there already ? "
80603	80607	80574	80574	Margaret	278	" We are . "
80608	80623	80574	80574	Margaret	278	" Well , I never ! In years ago it seemed so far away . "
80656	80672	80653	80653	Henry	360	" That 's no good ; it 's locked . Who 's got the key ? "
80727	80750	80722	80722	he	360	" Margaret , you wait in the dry . I 'll go down for the key . It is n't a hundred yards .
80751	80758	80722	80722	he	360	" May n't I come too ? "
80759	80771	80722	80722	he	360	" No ; I shall be back before I 'm gone . "
80970	80977	80979	80979	Margaret	278	" Naughty cow ! Go away ! "
81544	81552	81524	81524	Helen	268	" You will have to lose something . "
81631	81638	81639	81639	she	268	" Is that you , Henry ? "
81653	81661	81624	81624	she	268	" Henry , have you got in ? "
81747	81759	81721	81722	A woman	1137	" Oh ! Well , I took you for Ruth Wilcox . "
81763	81771	81760	81760	Margaret	346	" I - Mrs. Wilcox - I ? "
81772	81793	81795	81797	the old woman	4686	" In fancy , of course - in fancy . You had her way of walking . Good - day . "
81806	81814	81816	81817	Mr. Wilcox	261	" It gave her quite a turn , "
81830	81927	81928	81928	He	261	" None of you girls have any nerves , really . Of course , a word from me put it all right , but silly old Miss Avery - she frightened you , did n't she , Margaret ? There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds . She might have said something , instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on . I passed her as I came in . Enough to make the car shy . I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character ; some old maids do . "
81933	81960	81928	81928	He	261	" It is their last resource . Heaven knows what she was doing in the place ; but that 's Bryce 's business , not mine . "
81961	81971	81973	81973	Margaret	346	" I was n't as foolish as you suggest , "
81975	81990	81973	81973	Margaret	346	" She only startled me , for the house had been silent so long . "
81991	82000	82002	82002	Dolly	348	" Did you take her for a spook ? "
82008	82010	81928	81928	He	261	" and "
82014	82018	81973	81973	Margaret	346	" summarized the unseen .
82019	82023	81973	81973	Margaret	346	" Not exactly . "
82024	82031	82033	82033	Henry	360	" She really did frighten you , "
82044	82058	82033	82033	Henry	360	" Poor Margaret ! And very naturally . Uneducated classes are so stupid . "
82059	82066	82067	82067	Margaret	470	" Is Miss Avery uneducated classes ? "
82085	82189	82033	82033	Henry	360	" She 's just one of the crew at the farm . People like that always assume things . She assumed you 'd know who she was . She left all the Howards End keys in the front lobby , and assumed that you 'd seen them as you came in , that you 'd lock up the house when you 'd done , and would bring them on down to her . And there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm . Lack of education makes people very casual . Hilton was full of women like Miss Avery once . "
82190	82200	82222	82222	Dolly	348	" I should n't have disliked it , perhaps . "
82201	82211	82213	82213	Dolly	348	" Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present , "
82233	82251	82222	82222	Dolly	348	" But Charles said I must try not to mind , because she had known his grandmother . "
82252	82267	82222	82222	Dolly	348	" As usual , you 've got the story wrong , my good Dorothea . "
82268	82303	82222	82222	Dolly	348	" I mean great - grandmother - the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house . Were n't both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End , too , was a farm ? "
82363	82471	82355	82355	Dolly	348	" Then had n't Mrs. Wilcox a brother - or was it an uncle ? Anyhow , he popped the question , and Miss Avery , she said ' No . ' Just imagine , if she 'd said ' Yes , ' she would have been Charles 's aunt . Oh , I say , - that 's rather good ! ' Charlie 's Aunt ' ! I must chaff him about that this evening . And the man went out and was killed . Yes , I 'm certain I 've got it right now . Tom Howard - he was the last of them . "
82472	82477	82479	82480	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I believe so , "
82483	82494	82496	82496	Dolly	348	" I say ! Howards End - Howard 's Ended ! "
82498	82510	82496	82496	Dolly	348	" I 'm rather on the spot this evening , eh ? "
82511	82522	82355	82355	Dolly	348	" I wish you 'd ask whether Crane 's ended . "
82523	82533	82496	82496	Dolly	348	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox , how CAN you ? "
82534	82557	82558	82558	he	261	" Because , if he has had enough tea , we ought to go . - Dolly 's a good little woman , "
82561	82583	82558	82558	he	261	" but a little of her goes a long way . I could n't live near her if you paid me . "
82707	82711	82714	82714	Henry	360	" Curious mounds , "
82716	82726	82714	82714	Henry	360	" but in with you now ; another time . "
82945	82947	82927	82927	It	2479	" through "
83030	83036	83020	83020	He	360	" It is so unlucky , "
83041	83146	83020	83020	He	360	" that money was n't put into it about fifty years ago . Then it had four - five - times the land - thirty acres at least . One could have made something out of it then - a small park , or at all events shrubberies , and rebuilt the house farther away from the road . What 's the good of taking it in hand now ? Nothing but the meadow left , and even that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things - yes , and the house too . Oh , it was no joke . "
83177	83305	83170	83170	them	2485	" Mismanagement did it - besides , the days for small farms are over . It does n't pay - except with intensive cultivation . Small holdings , back to the land - ah ! philanthropic bunkum . Take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale . Most of the land you see they were standing at an upper window , the only one which faced west belongs to the people at the Park - they made their pile over copper - good chaps . Avery 's Farm , Sishe 's - what they call the Common , where you see that ruined oak - one after the other fell in , and so did this , as near as is no matter . "
83333	83445	83320	83320	he	360	" When I had more control I did what I could : sold off the two and a half animals , and the mangy pony , and the superannuated tools ; pulled down the outhouses ; drained ; thinned out I do n't know how many guelder - roses and elder - trees ; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a hall , and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was . Garage and so on came later . But one could still tell it 's been an old farm . And yet it is n't the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew . "
83723	83726	83727	83727	he	261	" Extraordinary ! "
83730	83735	83727	83727	he	261	" Who told you ? "
83736	83746	83752	83752	she	2491	" I heard of it one winter in London , "
83827	83837	83838	83838	she	265	" But I never dreamt of such a thing , "
83841	83868	83838	83838	she	265	" Dad took me to call now and then , and made me ask her to Simpson 's . Well , I 'm altogether off Dad . "
83898	83903	83886	83886	Evie	265	" as a protest . "
84202	84220	84197	84197	She	278	" Oh , So - and - so 's a good sort - a thundering good sort , "
84261	84265	84260	84264	The " thundering good sort	5216	" thundering good sort "
84271	84288	84260	84264	The " thundering good sort	5216	" a fellow for whom I never did have much use , and have less now , "
84933	84960	84931	84931	Tibby	262	" Mr. Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the pleasure of Mrs. Plynlimmon 's company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister Margaret . "

85741	85749	85750	85750	she	482	" They threaten to cut the painter , "
85753	85781	85750	85750	she	482	" and where shall we be then ? Miss Schlegel , you 'll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff Reform ? It is our last hope . "

85995	86000	86002	86002	he	349	" I 'm sorry , "
86007	86024	86002	86002	he	349	" Do you mind getting out - by the door on the right ? Steady on ! "
86025	86030	86032	86033	Mrs. Warrington	482	" What 's happened ? "
86052	86060	86047	86047	Charles	261	" Get out the women at once . "
86108	86113	86114	86115	the ladies	1048	" What is it ? "
86131	86144	86128	86128	he	261	" It 's all right . Your car just touched a dog . "
86145	86149	86151	86151	Margaret	278	" But stop ! "
86155	86162	86128	86128	he	261	" It did n't hurt him . "
86163	86170	86172	86172	Myra	482	" Did n't really hurt him ? "
86174	86177	86128	86128	he	261	" No . "
86178	86183	86185	86185	Margaret	278	" Do PLEASE stop ! "
86208	86217	86190	86190	She	278	" I want to go back , please . "

86251	86257	86259	86260	Mrs. Warrington	482	" I expect a little of "
86265	86277	86259	86260	Mrs. Warrington	482	" will be more to the point than one of us ! "
86278	86286	86288	86288	Charles	261	" The insurance company sees to that , "
86290	86298	86288	86288	Charles	261	" and Albert will do the talking . "
86299	86311	86313	86313	Margaret	278	" I want to go back , though , I say ! "
86339	86345	86347	86348	the others	608	" The men are there , "
86350	86357	86347	86348	the others	608	" Men will see to it . "
86358	86380	86347	86348	the others	608	" The men CAN'T see to it . Oh , this is ridiculous ! Charles , I ask you to stop . "
86381	86387	86389	86389	Charles	261	" Stopping 's no good , "
86391	86396	86398	86398	Margaret	278	" Is n't it ? "

86464	86471	86473	86473	Margaret	278	" There 's nothing to ask , "
86475	86481	86443	86443	her	278	" Your hand 's bleeding . "
86482	86486	86443	86443	her	278	" I know . "
86487	86499	86443	86443	her	278	" I 'm in for a frightful row from the pater . "

86578	86584	86585	86585	he	349	" It 's all right ! "
86588	86600	86585	86585	he	349	" It was n't a dog , it was a cat . "

86609	86616	86606	86606	Charles	261	" It 's only a rotten cat .
86617	86648	86585	86585	he	349	" Got room in your car for a little un ? I cut as soon as I saw it was n't a dog ; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl . "
86685	86700	86723	86725	The second motor	2634	" Miss Schlegel ! ' Pon my word , you 've hurt your hand . "

86731	86739	86741	86741	Crane	367	" lt is all right , madam , "
86754	86763	86723	86725	The second motor	2634	" What 's all right ? The cat ? "
86764	86777	86746	86746	He	367	" Yes , madam . The girl will receive compensation for it . "
86778	86786	86788	86788	Angelo	489	" She was a very ruda girla , "
86795	86803	86746	86746	He	367	" Would n't you have been rude ? "

86964	86971	86961	86961	she	478	" I have been so naughty , "
86982	87004	87005	87005	She	478	" We ran over a cat . Charles told me not to jump out , but I would , and look ! "
87012	87021	87005	87005	She	478	" Your poor Meg went such a flop . "
87042	87049	87051	87052	Mrs. Warrington	482	" Thinking it was a dog , "
87054	87063	87065	87066	Colonel Fussell	481	" Ah , a dog 's a companion ! "
87068	87074	87065	87066	Colonel Fussell	481	" A dog'll remember you . "
87075	87083	87115	87116	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Have you hurt yourself , Margaret ? "
87084	87097	87065	87066	Colonel Fussell	481	" Not to speak about ; and it 's my left hand . "
87098	87106	87115	87116	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Well , hurry up and change . "
87123	87132	87115	87116	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Now , Charles , what 's happened ? "
87467	87474	87475	87475	he	2655	" It is all very well , "
87478	87550	87475	87475	he	2655	" the pater saying that he will be just to all , but one ca n't be just indefinitely . Money is n't elastic . What 's to happen if Evie has a family ? And , come to that , so may the pater . There 'll not be enough to go round , for there 's none coming in , either through Dolly or Percy . It 's damnable ! "

87933	87978	87980	87980	she	2679	" But it does n't matter . Whichever you are , you will have to listen to me . I love this place . I love Shropshire . I hate London . I am glad that this will be my home . Ah , dear "

88767	88773	88738	88739	the child	2281	" I ca n't hear . "

89470	89538	89571	89571	He	2753	" One ca n't have ladies walking through the Market Square . The Fussells would n't like it ; they were awfully particular at Charles 's wedding . My - she - one of our party was anxious to walk , and certainly the church was just round the corner , and I should n't have minded ; but the Colonel made a great point of it . "
89539	89548	89550	89550	Margaret	278	" You men should n't be so chivalrous , "
89553	89557	89571	89571	He	2753	" Why not ? "
89732	89743	89729	89729	he	2763	" By your leave ; let me pass , please . "
89892	89900	89901	89901	she	278	" We shall never get through it ! "
90296	90301	90348	90348	Henry	360	" quite like a Durbar "
90457	90466	90467	90467	she	278	" I think it did go off well , "
90470	90545	90467	90467	she	278	" Since I had to jump out of the motor , I 'm thankful I lighted on my left hand . I am so very glad about it , Henry dear ; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable . You must all remember that we have no practical person among us , except my aunt , and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale . "
90546	90550	90551	90551	he	2804	" I know , "
90555	90585	90551	90551	he	2804	" Under the circumstances , it would be better to put everything into the hands of Harrod 's or Whiteley 's , or even to go to some hotel . "
90586	90592	90467	90467	she	278	" You desire a hotel ? "
90593	90619	90551	90551	he	2804	" Yes , because - well , I must n't interfere with you . No doubt you want to be married from your old home . "
90620	90644	90467	90467	she	278	" My old home 's falling into pieces , Henry . I only want my new . Is n't it a perfect evening - "
90645	90652	90551	90551	he	2804	" The Alexandrina is n't bad - "
90653	90657	90658	90658	she	2804	" The Alexandrina , "
90685	90692	90551	90551	he	2804	" It 's off Curzon Street . "
90693	90706	90551	90551	he	2804	" Is it ? Let 's be married from off Curzon Street . "
90795	90801	90802	90802	she	2804	" Who are those people ? "
90805	90810	90812	90812	Henry	360	" They 're callers ! "
90814	90822	90812	90812	Henry	360	" It 's too late for callers . "
90823	90837	90787	90790	A parlour - maid	2814	" Perhaps they 're town people who want to see the wedding presents . "
90838	90848	90812	90812	Henry	360	" I 'm not at home yet to townees . "
90849	90867	90787	90790	A parlour - maid	2814	" Well , hide among the ruins , and if I can stop them , I will . "
90959	90964	90965	90965	she	278	" What is it ? "
90968	90979	90965	90965	she	278	" Oh , what 's wrong ? Is Tibby ill ? "
90997	91002	91003	91003	she	278	" They 're starving ! "
91006	91012	90992	90992	she	479	" I found them starving ! "
91013	91021	90992	90992	she	479	" Who ? Why have you come ? "
91022	91026	90992	90992	she	479	" The Basts . "
91027	91032	91034	91034	Margaret	278	" Oh , Helen ! "
91036	91043	91034	91034	Margaret	278	" Whatever have you done now ? "
91044	91103	90992	90992	she	479	" He has lost his place . He has been turned out of his bank . Yes , he 's done for . We upper classes have ruined him , and I suppose you 'll tell me it 's the battle of life . Starving . His wife is ill . Starving . She fainted in the train . "
91104	91111	91034	91034	Margaret	278	" Helen , are you mad ? "
91112	91171	90992	90992	she	479	" Perhaps . Yes . If you like , I 'm mad . But I 've brought them . I 'll stand injustice no longer . I 'll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury , this talk of impersonal forces , this ca nt about God doing what we 're too slack to do ourselves . "
91172	91187	91034	91034	Margaret	278	" Have you actually brought two starving people from London to Shropshire , Helen ? "
91204	91214	91215	91215	she	479	" There was a restaurant car on the train , "
91218	91259	91260	91260	she	479	" Do n't be absurd . They are n't starving , and you know it . Now , begin from the beginning . I wo n't have such theatrical nonsense . How dare you ! Yes , how dare you ! "
91268	91293	91295	91295	she	479	" bursting in to Evie 's wedding in this heartless way . My goodness ! but you 've a perverted notion of philanthropy . Look "
91353	91353	91303	91303	people	3893	"
91354	91366	91368	91368	Helen	479	" Kindly take back that word ' hangers - on , ' "
91373	91377	91379	91379	Margaret	278	" Very well , "
91394	91421	91379	91379	Margaret	278	" I , too , am sorry about them , but it beats me why you 've brought them here , or why you 're here yourself .
91422	91433	91368	91368	Helen	479	" It 's our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox . "
91450	91468	91368	91368	Helen	479	" He 's going to Scotland . I know he is . I insist on seeing him . "
91469	91474	91368	91368	Helen	479	" Yes , tomorrow . "
91475	91484	91368	91368	Helen	479	" I knew it was our last chance . "
91485	91494	91496	91496	Margaret	278	" How do you do , Mr. Bast ? "
91504	91519	91496	91496	Margaret	278	" This is an odd business . What view do you take of it ? "
91520	91528	91530	91530	Helen	479	" There is Mrs. Bast , too , "
91692	91697	91699	91700	the lady	1142	" You have fainted , "
91708	91717	91699	91700	the lady	1142	" Perhaps the air will do you good . "
91737	91748	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" I 'm sure I do n't want to intrude , "
91759	91787	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" But you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the Porphyrion that I wondered - why , I wondered whether - "
91788	91800	91802	91802	Helen	479	" Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again , "
91804	91825	91802	91802	Helen	479	" Meg , this has been a cheerful business . A bright evening 's work that was on Chelsea Embankment . "
91836	91859	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" I do n't understand . You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern , did n't you ? "
91860	91865	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" That 's right . "
91866	91874	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" And went into a bank instead ? "
91875	91882	91884	91884	Helen	479	" I told you all that , "
91886	91919	91884	91884	Helen	479	" and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month , and now he 's penniless , and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame . "
91920	91926	91927	91927	Leonard	317	" I hate all this , "
91930	91984	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" I hope you do , Mr. Bast . But it 's no good mincing matters . You have done yourself no good by coming here . If you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox , and to call him to account for a chance remark , you will make a very great mistake . "
91985	91995	91997	91997	Helen	479	" I brought them . I did it all , "
91999	92064	91750	91750	Leonard	317	" I can only advise you to go at once . My sister has put you in a false position , and it is kindest to tell you so . It 's too late to get to town , but you 'll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton , where Mrs. Bast can rest , and I hope you 'll be my guests there . "
92065	92076	92078	92078	Leonard	317	" That is n't what I want , Miss Schlegel , "
92080	92108	92078	92078	Leonard	317	" You 're very kind , and no doubt it 's a false position , but you make me miserable . I seem no good at all . "
92109	92116	92118	92118	Helen	479	" It 's work he wants , "
92120	92126	92118	92118	Helen	479	" Ca n't you see ? "
92131	92177	92128	92128	he	317	" Jacky , let 's go . We 're more bother than we 're worth . We 're costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us , and they never will . There 's nothing we 're good enough to do . "
92178	92187	92189	92189	Margaret	278	" We would like to find you work , "
92193	92240	92189	92189	Margaret	278	" We want to - I , like my sister . You 're only down in your luck . Go to the hotel , have a good night 's rest , and some day you shall pay me back the bill , if you prefer it . "
92256	92267	92268	92268	he	317	" You do n't know what you 're talking about , "
92271	92430	92268	92268	he	317	" I shall never get work now . If rich people fail at one profession , they can try another . Not I. I had my groove , and I 've got out of it . I could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary , but that 's all . Poetry 's nothing , Miss Schlegel . One 's thoughts about this and that are nothing . Your money , too , is nothing , if you 'll understand me . I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job , it 's all over with him . I have seen it happen to others . Their friends gave them money for a little , but in the end they fall over the edge . It 's no good . It 's the whole world pulling . There always will be rich and poor . "
92434	92443	92445	92445	Margaret	278	" Wo n't you have something to eat ? "
92447	92515	92445	92445	Margaret	278	" I do n't know what to do . It is n't my house , and though Mr. Wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time - as I say , I do n't know what to do , but I undertake to do what I can for you . Helen , offer them something . Do try a sandwich , Mrs. Bast . "
92584	92608	92581	92581	She	278	" Helen , I like Mr. Bast . I agree that he 's worth helping . I agree that we are directly responsible . "
92609	92618	92671	92671	Helen	479	" No , indirectly . Via Mr. Wilcox . "
92619	92670	92581	92581	She	278	" Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude , I 'll do nothing . No doubt you 're right logically , and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about Henry . Only , I wo n't have it . So choose .
92677	92756	92671	92671	Helen	479	" If you promise to take them quietly to the George , I will speak to Henry about them - in my own way , mind ; there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice . I have no use for justice . If it was only a question of money , we could do it ourselves . But he wants work , and that we ca n't give him , but possibly Henry can . "
92757	92764	92766	92766	Helen	479	" It 's his duty to , "
92768	92843	92671	92671	Helen	479	" Nor am I concerned with duty . I 'm concerned with the characters of various people whom we know , and how , things being as they are , things may be made a little better . Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours : all business men do . But I am going to ask him , at the risk of a rebuff , because I want to make things a little better . "
92844	92857	92671	92671	Helen	479	" Very well . I promise . You take it very calmly . "
92858	92881	92886	92886	she	479	" Take them off to the George , then , and I 'll try . Poor creatures ! but they look tried . "
92889	92944	92886	92886	she	479	" I have n't nearly done with you , though , Helen . You have been most self - indulgent . I ca n't get over it . You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older . Think it over and alter yourself , or we sha n't have happy lives . "
92962	92967	92968	92968	he	360	" Was it townees ? "
92978	92985	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" You 'll never believe me , "
92994	93007	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" It 's all right now , but it was my sister . "
93008	93012	93013	93013	he	360	" Helen here ? "
93020	93033	93013	93013	he	360	" But she refused the invitation . I thought she despised weddings . "
93034	93057	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" Do n't get up . She has not come to the wedding . I 've bundled her off to the George . "
93064	93082	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" No ; she has two of her proteges with her , and must keep with them . "
93083	93089	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" Let 'em all come . "
93090	93100	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" My dear Henry , did you see them ? "
93101	93115	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman , certainly .
93116	93137	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" The brown bunch was Helen , but did you catch sight of a sea - green and salmon bunch ? "
93138	93146	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" What ! are they out beanfeasting ? "
93147	93170	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" No ; business . They wanted to see me , and later on I want to talk to you about them . "
93216	93231	93206	93206	Henry	360	" Why later on ? Tell me now . No time like the present . "
93232	93236	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" Shall I ? "
93237	93246	93206	93206	Henry	360	" If it is n't a long story . "
93247	93279	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" Oh , not five minutes ; but there 's a sting at the end of it , for I want you to find the man some work in your office . "
93280	93286	93206	93206	Henry	360	" What are his qualifications ? "
93287	93298	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" I do n't know . He 's a clerk . "
93299	93303	93206	93206	Henry	360	" How old ? "
93304	93311	92987	92987	Margaret	278	" Twenty - five , perhaps . "
93312	93318	93206	93206	Henry	360	" What 's his name ? "
93319	93322	93324	93324	Margaret	278	" Bast , "
93352	93358	93206	93206	Henry	360	" Where was he before ? "
93359	93364	93206	93206	Henry	360	" Dempster 's Bank . "
93365	93371	93372	93372	he	360	" Why did he leave ? "
93379	93385	93206	93206	Henry	360	" They reduced their staff . "
93386	93395	93206	93206	Henry	360	" All right ; I 'll see him . "
93430	93452	93420	93421	Mrs. Plynlimmon	477	" The woman who ca n't influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself . "
93486	93496	93497	93497	she	278	" I should be glad if you took him , "
93500	93511	93497	93497	she	278	" but I do n't know whether he 's qualified . "
93512	93533	93458	93458	she	278	" I 'll do what I can . But , Margaret , this must n't be taken as a precedent . "
93534	93543	93497	93497	she	278	" No , of course - of course - "
93544	93559	93458	93458	she	278	" I ca n't fit in your proteges every day . Business would suffer . "
93560	93579	93497	93497	she	278	" I can promise you he 's the last . He - he 's rather a special case . "
93580	93585	93458	93458	she	278	" Proteges always are . "
93705	93713	93715	93715	he	360	" Your protege has made us late , "
93717	93725	93715	93715	he	360	" The Fussells will just be starting . "
94018	94023	94024	94024	Margaret	278	" She 's overtired , "
94027	94033	94035	94035	Henry	360	" She 's something else , "
94037	94055	94035	94035	Henry	360	" This wo n't do . I ca n't have her in my garden in this state . "
94056	94060	94061	94061	Margaret	278	" Is she - "
94065	94068	94061	94061	Margaret	278	" drunk . "
94112	94124	94125	94125	he	360	" Madam , you will be more comfortable at the hotel , "
94132	94139	94129	94129	Jacky	325	" If it is n't Hen ! "
94140	94150	94152	94152	Margaret	278	" Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble , "
94154	94162	94152	94152	Margaret	278	" Il est tout a fait different . "
94163	94166	94167	94167	she	278	" Henry ! "
94179	94189	94190	94190	he	261	" I ca n't congratulate you on your proteges , "
94193	94211	94152	94152	Margaret	278	" Hen , do n't go . You do love me , dear , do n't you ? "
94212	94220	94222	94222	Margaret	278	" Bless us , what a person ! "
94235	94245	94246	94246	She	278	" You 're a nice boy , you are . "
94249	94257	94246	94246	She	278	" There now , I love you . "
94258	94266	94229	94229	Jacky	325	" Henry , I am awfully sorry . "
94267	94272	94273	94273	he	261	" And pray why ? "
94298	94307	94229	94229	Jacky	325	" To have brought this down on you . "
94308	94314	94229	94229	Jacky	325	" Pray do n't apologize . "
94319	94329	94331	94331	Margaret	278	" Why does she call you ' Hen ' ? "
94334	94342	94331	94331	Margaret	278	" Has she ever seen you before ? "
94343	94348	94350	94350	Jacky	325	" Seen Hen before ! "
94352	94380	94350	94350	Jacky	325	" Who has n't seen Hen ? He 's serving you like me , my dear . These boys ! You wait - Still we love 'em . "
94381	94387	94388	94388	Henry	360	" Are you now satisfied ? "
94397	94408	94409	94409	she	278	" I do n't know what it is all about , "
94412	94418	94409	94409	she	278	" Let 's come in . "
94439	94445	94446	94446	he	360	" Do n't you indeed ? "
94450	94466	94446	94446	he	360	" I do . Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan . "
94467	94477	94420	94420	he	360	" This is Helen 's plan , not mine . "
94478	94535	94446	94446	he	360	" I now understand your interest in the Basts . Very well thought out . I am amused at your caution , Margaret . You are quite right - it was necessary . I am a man , and have lived a man 's past . I have the honour to release you from your engagement . "
94574	94578	94581	94581	her	2875	" So that - "
94595	94599	94601	94602	Colonel Fussell	481	" So what ? "
94614	94633	94642	94642	she	2875	" We were saying - Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument , my point being - "
94660	94668	94670	94670	Henry	360	" No , let me do that , "
94674	94687	94642	94642	she	2875	" Thanks so much ! You see - he has forgiven me ! "
94693	94703	94688	94689	The Colonel	2655	" I do n't expect there 's much to forgive .
94759	94768	94756	94756	Margaret	278	" So that woman has been your mistress ? "
94769	94778	94779	94779	he	325	" You put it with your usual delicacy , "
94782	94787	94756	94756	Margaret	278	" When , please ? "
94788	94791	94756	94756	Margaret	278	" Why ? "
94792	94797	94756	94756	Margaret	278	" When , please ? "
94798	94803	94756	94756	Margaret	278	" Ten years ago . "
94929	94936	94937	94937	she	479	" Mr. Wilcox is so illogical , "
94962	95011	94937	94937	she	479	" If we told him it was his duty to take you on , he might refuse to do it . The fact is , he is n't properly educated . I do n't want to set you against him , but you 'll find him a trial . "
95012	95023	95027	95027	Leonard	317	" I can never thank you sufficiently , Miss Schlegel , "
95032	95151	94937	94937	she	479	" I believe in personal responsibility . Do n't you ? And in personal everything . I hate - I suppose I ought n't to say that - but the Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely . Or perhaps it is n't their fault . Perhaps the little thing that says ' I ' is missing out of the middle of their heads , and then it 's a waste of time to blame them . There 's a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says ' I. ' Had you heard that ? "
95152	95160	95247	95247	she	2895	" I get no time for reading . "
95161	95235	94937	94937	she	479	" Had you thought it , then ? That there are two kinds of people - our kind , who live straight from the middle of their heads , and the other kind who ca n't , because their heads have no middle ? They ca n't say ' I. ' They AREN'T in fact , and so they 're supermen . Pierpont Morgan has never said ' I ' in his life . "
95261	95269	95270	95270	he	317	" I never got on to Nietzsche , "
95273	95289	95270	95270	he	317	" But I always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists . "
95290	95299	95301	95301	Helen	479	" Oh , no , that 's wrong , "
95303	95400	95301	95301	Helen	479	" No superman ever said ' I want , ' because ' I want ' must lead to the question , ' Who am I ? ' and so to Pity and to Justice . He only says ' want . ' ' Want Europe , ' if he 's Napoleon ; ' want wives , ' if he 's Bluebeard ; ' want Botticelli , ' if he 's Pierpont Morgan . Never the ' I ' ; and if you could pierce through him , you 'd find panic and emptiness in the middle . "
95412	95435	95409	95409	he	317	" May I take it , Miss Schlegel , that you and I are both the sort that say ' I ' ? "
95436	95440	95409	95409	he	317	" Of course . "
95441	95447	95409	95409	he	317	" And your sister too ? "
95448	95452	95454	95454	Helen	479	" Of course , "
95473	95481	95460	95460	She	479	" All presentable people say ' I. ' "
95482	95492	95454	95454	Helen	479	" But Mr. Wilcox - he is not perhaps - "
95493	95508	95460	95460	She	479	" I do n't know that it 's any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either . "
95509	95516	95517	95517	he	317	" Quite so , quite so , "
95677	95679	95674	95674	Helen	479	" his "
95890	95902	95903	95903	she	1450	" Mrs. Bast - does she ever say ' I ' ? "
95912	95918	95903	95903	she	1450	" Is she very tired ? "
95919	95929	95931	95931	Leonard	317	" It 's better she stops in her room , "
95933	95941	95903	95903	she	1450	" Shall I sit up with her ? "
95942	95954	95903	95903	she	1450	" No , thank you ; she does not need company . "
95955	95967	95903	95903	she	1450	" Mr. Bast , what kind of woman is your wife ? "
95975	95991	95968	95968	Leonard	317	" You ought to know my ways by now . Does that question offend you ? "
95992	96003	95903	95903	she	1450	" No , oh no , Miss Schlegel , no . "
96004	96030	95968	95968	Leonard	317	" Because I love honesty . Do n't pretend your marriage has been a happy one . You and she can have nothing in common . "
96041	96108	96031	96031	He	317	" I suppose that 's pretty obvious ; but Jacky never meant to do anybody any harm . When things went wrong , or I heard things , I used to think it was her fault , but , looking back , it 's more mine . I need n't have married her , but as I have I must stick to her and keep her . "
96109	96117	95968	95968	Leonard	317	" How long have you been married ? "
96118	96123	96031	96031	He	317	" Nearly three years . "
96124	96131	95968	95968	Leonard	317	" What did your people say ? "
96132	96163	96031	96031	He	317	" They will not have anything to do with us . They had a sort of family council when they heard I was married , and cut us off altogether . "
96174	96183	96184	96184	she	479	" My good boy , what a mess ! "
96188	96194	96184	96184	she	479	" Who are your people ? "
96227	96232	96233	96233	Leonard	317	" And your grandparents ? "
96247	96255	96256	96256	he	317	" They were just nothing at all , "
96259	96267	96256	96256	he	317	" - agricultural labourers and that sort . "
96268	96275	96233	96233	Leonard	317	" So ! From which part ? "
96276	96298	96256	96256	he	317	" Lincolnshire mostly , but my mother 's father - he , oddly enough , came from these parts round here . "
96299	96331	96233	96233	Leonard	317	" From this very Shropshire . Yes , that is odd . My mother 's people were Lancashire . But why do your brother and your sisters object to Mrs. Bast ? "
96332	96340	96256	96256	he	317	" Oh , I do n't know . "
96341	96384	96233	96233	Leonard	317	" Excuse me , you do know . I am not a baby . I can bear anything you tell me , and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help . Have they heard anything against her ? "
96389	96397	96399	96399	Helen	479	" I think I have guessed now , "
96403	96417	96256	96256	he	317	" I do n't think so , Miss Schlegel ; I hope not . "
96418	96475	96233	96233	Leonard	317	" We must be honest , even over these things . I have guessed . I am frightfully , dreadfully sorry , but it does not make the least difference to me . I shall feel just the same to both of you . I blame , not your wife for these things , but men . "
96528	96534	96535	96535	he	317	" Do n't you worry , "
96538	96604	96535	96535	he	317	" I ca n't bear that . We shall be all right if I get work . If I could only get work - something regular to do . Then it would n't be so bad again . I do n't trouble after books as I used . I can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again . It stops one thinking . "
96605	96611	96518	96518	she	479	" Settle down to what ? "
96612	96619	96535	96535	he	317	" Oh , just settle down . "
96620	96628	96630	96630	Helen	479	" And that 's to be life ! "
96639	96662	96630	96630	Helen	479	" How can you , with all the beautiful things to see and do - with music - with walking at night - "
96663	96675	96676	96676	he	317	" Walking is well enough when a man 's in work , "
96679	96769	96676	96676	he	317	" Oh , I did talk a lot of nonsense once , but there 's nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you . When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and Stevensons , I seemed to see life straight real , and it is n't a pretty sight . My books are back again , thanks to you , but they 'll never be the same to me again , and I sha n't ever again think night in the woods is wonderful . "
96770	96774	96776	96776	Helen	479	" Why not ? "
96783	96792	96630	96630	Helen	479	" Because I see one must have money . "
96793	96800	96630	96630	Helen	479	" Well , you 're wrong . "
96801	96880	96630	96630	Helen	479	" I wish I was wrong , but - the clergyman - he has money of his own , or else he 's paid ; the poet or the musician - just the same ; the tramp - he 's no different . The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end , and is paid for with other people 's money . Miss Schlegel , the real thing 's money and all the rest is a dream . "
96881	96892	96630	96630	Helen	479	" You 're still wrong . You 've forgotten Death . "
96898	97029	96630	96630	Helen	479	" If we lived for ever what you say would be true . But we have to die , we have to leave life presently . Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever . As it is , we must hold to other things , because Death is coming . I love Death - not morbidly , but because He explains . He shows me the emptiness of Money . Death and Money are the eternal foes . Not Death and Life . Never mind what lies behind Death , Mr. Bast , but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say , ' I am I. ' "
97030	97034	96630	96630	Helen	479	" I wonder . "
97035	97110	96630	96630	Helen	479	" We are all in a mist - I know but I can help you this far - men like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any . Sane , sound Englishmen ! building up empires , levelling all the world into what they call common sense . But mention Death to them and they 're offended , because Death 's really Imperial , and He cries out against them for ever . "
97111	97122	96630	96630	Helen	479	" I am as afraid of Death as any one . "
97123	97132	96630	96630	Helen	479	" But not of the idea of Death . "
97133	97140	96630	96630	Helen	479	" But what is the difference ? "
97141	97145	97147	97147	Helen	479	" Infinite difference , "
97263	97269	97270	97270	he	317	" I must be stupid , "
97284	97297	97276	97276	Helen	479	" Death destroys a man : the idea of Death saves him . "
97387	97393	97395	97396	the girl	969	" So never give in , "
97568	97573	97574	97574	she	278	" My dearest boy , "
97577	97629	97574	97574	she	278	" this is not to part us . It is everything or nothing , and I mean it to be nothing . It happened long before we ever met , and even if it had happened since , I should be writing the same , I hope . I do understand . "
97634	97638	97631	97631	she	278	" I do understand "
97659	97666	97654	97654	She	278	" It is everything or nothing . "
97687	97695	97696	97696	she	278	" I think that 'll about do , "
97933	97940	97941	97942	the gods	1899	" Men did produce one jewel , "
98350	98355	98356	98356	he	360	" Who 's there ? "
98370	98378	98379	98379	she	278	" I have asked Helen to sleep , "
98382	98397	98379	98379	she	278	" She is best here ; so do n't lock the front - door . "
98398	98406	98408	98408	Henry	360	" I thought someone had got in , "
98410	98442	98379	98379	she	278	" At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him . I do n't know about later , but now the Basts must clearly go . "
98443	98457	98379	98379	she	278	" Did you say that your sister is sleeping here , after all ? "
98458	98461	98379	98379	she	278	" Probably . "
98462	98473	98379	98379	she	278	" Is she to be shown up to your room ? "
98474	98506	98379	98379	she	278	" I have naturally nothing to say to her ; I am going to bed . Will you tell the servants about Helen ? Could someone go to carry her bag ? "
98522	98537	98507	98507	He	2958	" You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear . "
98552	98559	98560	98560	he	360	" Far too much screaming there , "
99018	99022	99024	99024	her	278	" Henry dear - "
99085	99112	99078	99078	she	278	" Henry dear , look at me . No , I wo n't have you shirking . Look at me . There . That 's all . "
99113	99121	99122	99122	he	360	" You 're referring to last evening , "
99126	99169	99122	99122	he	360	" I have released you from your engagement . I could find excuses , but I wo n't . No , I wo n't . A thousand times no . I 'm a bad lot , and must be left at that . "
99209	99241	99191	99191	her	2979	" Leave it where you will , boy . It 's not going to trouble us : I know what I 'm talking about , and it will make no difference . "
99242	99246	99247	99247	he	360	" No difference ? "
99250	99266	99247	99247	he	360	" No difference , when you find that I am not the fellow you thought ? "
99355	99362	99363	99363	he	360	" I am unworthy of you , "
99366	99406	99363	99363	he	360	" Had I been worthy , I should not have released you from your engagement . I know what I am talking about . I ca n't bear to talk of such things . We had better leave it . "
99428	99471	99412	99412	He	360	" You , with your sheltered life , and refined pursuits , and friends , and books , you and your sister , and women like you - I say , how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man ? "
99472	99479	99481	99481	Margaret	278	" It is difficult for us , "
99483	99495	99481	99481	Margaret	278	" but if we are worth marrying , we do guess . "
99496	99541	99412	99412	He	360	" Cut off from decent society and family ties , what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas ? Isolated . No one near . I know by bitter experience , and yet you say it makes ' no difference . ' "
99542	99547	99481	99481	Margaret	278	" Not to me . "
99629	99634	99635	99635	she	278	" Did Helen come ? "
99643	99665	99638	99638	He	2981	" But that wo n't do at all , at all ! We do n't want her gossiping with Mrs. Bast . "
99666	99672	99673	99673	he	2981	" Good God ! no ! "
99685	99710	99680	99680	he	2981	" Let them gossip . My game 's up , though I thank you for your unselfishness - little as my thanks are worth . "
99711	99722	99638	99638	He	2981	" Did n't she send me a message or anything ? "
99723	99729	99680	99680	he	2981	" I heard of none . "
99730	99739	99638	99638	He	2981	" Would you ring the bell , please ? "
99740	99745	99680	99680	he	2981	" What to do ? "
99746	99752	99638	99638	He	2981	" Why , to inquire . "
99802	99810	99812	99812	Margaret	278	" I 'll go , thank you , "
99818	99824	99826	99826	Henry	360	" It is no good , "
99828	99874	99826	99826	Henry	360	" Those things leak out ; you can not stop a story once it has started . I have known cases of other men - I despised them once , I thought that I'M different , I shall never be tempted . Oh , Margaret - "
99895	99996	99886	99886	She	278	" We fellows all come to grief once in our time . Will you believe that ? There are moments when the strongest man - ' Let him who standeth , take heed lest he fall . ' That 's true , is n't it ? If you knew all , you would excuse me . I was far from good influences - far even from England . I was very , very lonely , and longed for a woman 's voice . That 's enough . I have told you too much already for you to forgive me now . "
99997	100006	100014	100014	his	360	" Yes , that 's enough , dear . "
100007	100010	100012	100012	he	360	" I have "
100017	100024	100014	100014	his	360	" I have been through hell . "
100046	100058	100014	100014	his	360	" There ! that 's over . Now for respectable life again "
100219	100228	100216	100216	she	2985	" I have already forgiven you , Henry . "
100475	100502	100584	100584	Margaret	278	" Well , let them go - the man and his wife , I mean , for the more we see of your sister the better . "
100503	100546	100584	100584	Margaret	278	" But they have gone separately - Helen very early , the Basts just before I arrived . They have left no message . They have answered neither of my notes . I do n't like to think what it all means . "
100547	100556	100584	100584	Margaret	278	" What did you say in the notes ? "
100557	100564	100584	100584	Margaret	278	" I told you last night . "
100565	100583	100584	100584	Margaret	278	" Oh - ah - yes ! Dear , would you like one turn in the garden ? "
100669	100715	100665	100665	her	278	" I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George . Helen would not have left unless she had heard something . I mismanaged that . It is wretched . I ought to - have parted her from that woman at once .
100716	100719	100720	100720	he	3007	" Margaret ! "
100728	100735	100665	100665	her	278	" Yes - yes , Henry ? "
100736	100787	100665	100665	her	278	" I am far from a saint - in fact , the reverse - but you have taken me , for better or worse . Bygones must be bygones . You have promised to forgive me . Margaret , a promise is a promise . Never mention that woman again . "
100788	100797	100665	100665	her	278	" Except for some practical reason - never . "
100798	100804	100665	100665	her	278	" Practical ! You practical ! "
100805	100812	100813	100813	she	278	" Yes , I 'm practical , "
100886	100896	100897	100897	he	3007	" At all events , you must n't worry , "
100900	100908	100897	100897	he	3007	" This is a man 's business . "
100913	100922	100909	100909	He	3007	" On no account mention it to anybody . "
101508	101514	101555	101555	They	3880	" See the Conquering Hero . "
101837	101844	101845	101845	she	479	" I have come from Oniton , "
101848	101859	101845	101845	she	479	" There has been a great deal of trouble there . "
101860	101866	101868	101868	Tibby	262	" Who 's for lunch ? "
101890	101897	101898	101898	he	262	" Why such an early start ? "
101901	101912	101845	101845	she	479	" Sunrise or something - when I could get away . "
101913	101920	101975	101976	The landlady	3059	" So I surmise . Why ? "
101921	101974	101845	101845	she	479	" I do n't know what 's to be done , Tibby . I am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns Meg , and do not want to face her , and I am not going back to Wickham Place . I stopped here to tell you this . "
102032	102056	102026	102026	Helen	479	" Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone . I mean to go to Munich or else Bonn . "
102057	102065	102067	102068	her brother	665	" Such a message is easily given , "
102070	102147	102148	102148	She	479	" As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture , you and she are to do exactly as you like . My own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold . What does one want with dusty economic , books , which have made the world no better , or with mother 's hideous chiffoniers ? I have also another commission for you . I want you to deliver a letter . "
102152	102169	102170	102170	She	479	" I have n't written it yet . Why should n't I post it , though ? "
102175	102195	102170	102170	She	479	" My head is rather wretched . I hope that none of your friends are likely to come in . "
102223	102227	102229	102229	Helen	479	" Not there , "
102330	102339	102340	102340	he	262	" Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in ? "
102343	102355	102340	102340	he	262	" or shall I take it from her at the door ? "
102356	102365	102366	102366	He	262	" Could I bathe my eyes , Tibby ? "
102449	102455	102456	102456	she	479	" Now for the explanation , "
102459	102519	102456	102456	she	479	" Why did n't I begin with it ? I have found out something about Mr. Wilcox . He has behaved very wrongly indeed , and ruined two people 's lives . It all came on me very suddenly last night ; I am very much upset , and I do not know what to do . Mrs. Bast - "
102520	102526	102527	102527	Helen	479	" Oh , those people ! "
102531	102539	102456	102456	she	479	" Shall I lock the door again ? "
102540	102674	102456	102456	she	479	" No , thanks , Tibbikins . You 're being very good to me . I want to tell you the story before I go abroad . You must do exactly what you like - treat it as part of the furniture . Meg can not have heard it yet , I think . But I can not face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself . I do n't even know whether she ought to be told . Knowing as she does that I dislike him , she will suspect me , and think that I want to ruin her match . I simply do n't know what to make of such a thing . I trust your judgment . What would you do ? "
102675	102684	102686	102686	Tibby	262	" I gather he has had a mistress , "
102695	102788	102688	102688	Helen	479	" And ruined two people 's lives . And goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing , and there always will be rich and poor . He met her when he was trying to get rich out in Cyprus - I do n't wish to make him worse than he is , and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him . But there it is . They met . He goes his way and she goes hers . What do you suppose is the end of such women ? "
102798	102857	102456	102456	she	479	" They end in two ways : Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them , and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy , or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late . She - I ca n't blame her .
102858	102865	102866	102866	she	3065	" But this is n't all , "
102882	103079	102866	102866	she	3065	" I come now to the business that took us to Oniton . We went all three . Acting on Mr. Wilcox 's advice , the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one , from which he is dismissed . There are certain excuses , but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to blame , as Meg herself admitted . It is only common justice that he should employ the man himself . But he meets the woman , and , like the cur that he is , he refuses , and tries to get rid of them . He makes Meg write . Two notes came from her late that evening - one for me , one for Leonard , dismissing him with barely a reason . I could n't understand . Then it comes out that Mrs. Bast had spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms , and was still speaking about him when Leonard came back to her . This Leonard knew all along . He thought it natural he should be ruined twice . Natural ! Could you have contained yourself ? .
103080	103089	103091	103091	Tibby	262	" It is certainly a very bad business , "
103101	103150	103093	103093	His	262	" I was afraid that I saw it out of proportion . But you are right outside it , and you must know . In a day or two - or perhaps a week - take whatever steps you think fit . I leave it in your hands . "
103156	103168	103169	103169	she	1485	" The facts as they touch Meg are all before you , "
103245	103248	103254	103254	Margaret	278	" personal relations "
103325	103345	103275	103275	Oxford	96	" You see , Helen - have a cigarette - I do n't see what I 'm to do . "
103346	103373	103275	103275	Oxford	96	" Then there 's nothing to be done . I dare say you are right . Let them marry . There remains the question of compensation . "
103374	103392	103275	103275	Oxford	96	" Do you want me to adjudicate that too ? Had you not better consult an expert ? "
103393	103400	103402	103402	Helen	479	" This part is in confidence , "
103404	103488	103402	103402	Helen	479	" It has nothing to do with Meg , and do not mention it to her . The compensation - I do not see who is to pay it if I do n't , and I have already decided on the minimum sum . As soon as possible I am placing it to your account , and when I am in Germany you will pay it over for me . I shall never forget your kindness , Tibbikins , if you do this . "
103489	103495	103275	103275	Oxford	96	" What is the sum ? "
103496	103500	103402	103402	Helen	479	" Five thousand . "
103501	103506	103508	103508	Tibby	262	" Good God alive ! "
103514	103565	103402	103402	Helen	479	" Now , what is the good of driblets ? To go through life having done one thing - to have raised one person from the abyss : not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets - making the grey more grey . No doubt people will think me extraordinary . "
103566	103577	103579	103579	he	262	" I do n't care a damn what people think ! "
103588	103597	103579	103579	he	262	" But it 's half what you have . "
103598	103603	103604	103604	She	3075	" Not nearly half . "
103614	103661	103607	103607	her	3075	" I have far too much , and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet . What I give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two . It is n't enough . "
103732	103742	103711	103711	he	262	" I did n't expect you to understand me . "
103743	103750	103820	103820	her	3077	" I ? I understand nobody . "
103751	103758	103711	103711	he	262	" But you 'll do it ? "
103759	103762	103820	103820	her	3077	" Apparently . "
103763	103816	103711	103711	he	262	" I leave you two commissions , then . The first concerns Mr. Wilcox , and you are to use your discretion . The second concerns the money , and is to be mentioned to no one , and carried out literally . You will send a hundred pounds on account tomorrow . "
103944	103953	103935	103935	She	479	" Does that seem to you so odd ? "
104038	104049	104035	104035	she	278	" Did she seem worried at any rumour about Henry ? "
104053	104056	104035	104035	she	278	" Yes . "
104057	104064	104065	104065	she	278	" I knew it was that ! "
104068	104075	104065	104065	she	278	" I 'll write to her . "
105023	105055	105056	105056	Helen	479	" I do n't say there is no standard , for that would destroy morality ; only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood . "
105477	105486	105487	105487	he	261	" I did n't want to bother you , "
105490	105502	105487	105487	he	261	" Besides , I have only heard for certain this morning . "
105503	105510	105512	105512	Margaret	346	" Where are we to live ? "
105518	105537	105512	105512	Margaret	346	" I loved the place extraordinarily . Do n't you believe in having a permanent home , Henry ? "
105567	105583	105558	105558	he	261	" This is news . I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp . "
105584	105589	105591	105591	he	261	" My dear girl ! "
105597	105714	105591	105591	he	261	" have you eyes ? have you a skin ? How could it be anything but damp in such a situation ? In the first place , the Grange is on clay , and built where the castle moat must have been ; then there 's that destestable little river , steaming all night like a kettle . Feel the cellar walls ; look up under the eaves . Ask Sir James or anyone . Those Shropshire valleys are notorious . The only possible place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill ; but , for my part , I think the country is too far from London , and the scenery nothing special . "
105721	105730	105715	105715	Margaret	346	" Why did you go there , then ? "
105731	105736	105737	105737	He	261	" I - because - "
105747	105771	105739	105739	his	261	" Why have we come to the Tyrol , if it comes to that ? One might go on asking such questions indefinitely . "
105801	105822	105791	105791	he	261	" The truth is , I took Oniton on account of Evie . Do n't let this go any further . "
105823	105827	105715	105715	Margaret	346	" Certainly not . "
105828	105931	105791	105791	he	261	" I should n't like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain . No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged . Poor little girl ! She was so keen on it all , and would n't even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting . Afraid it would get snapped up - just like all of your sex . Well , no harm 's done . She has had her country wedding , and I 've got rid of my house to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school . "
105932	105948	105715	105715	Margaret	346	" Where shall we live , then , Henry ? I should enjoy living somewhere . "
105949	105960	105791	105791	he	261	" I have not yet decided . What about Norfolk ? "
106060	106066	106068	106068	Henry	360	" It is now what ? "
106070	106092	106068	106068	Henry	360	" Nearly October . Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street , and look out for something in the spring .
106093	106118	106068	106068	Henry	360	" If possible , something permanent . I ca n't be as young as I was , for these alterations do n't suit me . "
106119	106135	106068	106068	Henry	360	" But , my dear , which would you rather have - alterations or rheumatism ? "
106136	106142	106144	106144	Margaret	346	" I see your point , "
106149	106218	106144	106144	Margaret	346	" If Oniton is really damp , it is impossible , and must be inhabited by little boys . Only , in the spring , let us look before we leap . I will take warning by Evie , and not hurry you . Remember that you have a free hand this time . These endless moves must be bad for the furniture , and are certainly expensive . "
106219	106241	106068	106068	Henry	360	" What a practical little woman it is ! What 's it been reading ? Theo - theo - how much ? "
106242	106245	106144	106144	Margaret	346	" Theosophy . "
106440	106442	106430	106430	they	3164	" miss "
106584	106591	106592	106592	Dolly	348	" Have you heard the news ? "
106603	106628	106592	106592	Dolly	348	" Charles is so ang - I mean he is sure you know about it , or rather , that you do n't know . "
106629	106634	106636	106636	Margaret	346	" Why , Dolly ! "
106642	106656	106636	106636	Margaret	346	" Here 's a surprise ! How are the boys and the baby ? "
106729	106743	106723	106723	she	348	" But lucky you , with four courts of your own at Midhurst . "
106744	106751	106753	106753	Margaret	346	" It will be very jolly , "
106755	106768	106723	106723	she	348	" Are those the plans ? Does it matter me seeing them ? "
106769	106774	106723	106723	she	348	" Of course not . "
106775	106783	106723	106723	she	348	" Charles has never seen the plans . "
106784	106823	106723	106723	she	348	" They have only just arrived . Here is the ground floor - no , that 's rather difficult . Try the elevation . We are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky - line . "
106824	106832	106834	106834	Dolly	348	" What makes it smell so funny ? "
106851	106857	106723	106723	she	348	" I suppose the paper . "
106858	106866	106723	106723	she	348	" And WHICH way up is it ? "
106867	106891	106723	106723	she	348	" Just the ordinary way up . That 's the sky - line , and the part that smells strongest is the sky . "
106892	106914	106723	106723	she	348	" Well , ask me another . Margaret - oh - what was I going to say ? How 's Helen ? "
106915	106919	106723	106723	she	348	" Quite well . "
106920	106940	106723	106723	she	348	" Is she never coming back to England ? Every one thinks it 's awfully odd she does n't . "
106941	106946	106948	106948	Margaret	346	" So it is , "
106965	106979	106956	106956	She	346	" Helen is odd , awfully . She has now been away eight months .
106980	106988	106723	106723	she	348	" But has n't she any address ? "
106989	107014	106956	106956	She	346	" A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address . Do write her a line . I will look it up for you . "
107015	107033	106723	106723	she	348	" No , do n't bother . That 's eight months she has been away , surely ? "
107034	107051	106956	106956	She	346	" Exactly . She left just after Evie 's wedding . It would be eight months . "
107052	107061	106723	106723	she	348	" Just when baby was born , then ? "
107062	107066	106956	106956	She	346	" Just so . "
107192	107196	107197	107197	she	348	" Oh yes , "
107200	107215	107197	107197	she	348	" that is it : Miss Avery has been unpacking your packing - cases . "
107216	107226	107179	107179	She	348	" Why has she done that ? How unnecessary ! "
107227	107238	107197	107197	she	348	" Ask another . I suppose you ordered her to . "
107239	107262	107179	107179	She	348	" I gave no such orders . Perhaps she was airing the things . She did undertake to light an occasional fire . "
107263	107272	107274	107274	Dolly	348	" It was far more than an air , "
107277	107305	107274	107274	Dolly	348	" The floor sounds covered with books . Charles sent me to know what is to be done , for he feels certain you do n't know . "
107306	107309	107311	107311	Margaret	346	" Books ! "
107319	107333	107311	107311	Margaret	346	" Dolly , are you serious ? Has she been touching our books ? "
107334	107361	107179	107179	She	348	" Has n't she , though ! What used to be the hall 's full of them . Charles thought for certain you knew of it . "
107362	107415	107311	107311	Margaret	346	" I am very much obliged to you , Dolly . What can have come over Miss Avery ? I must go down about it at once . Some of the books are my brother 's , and are quite valuable . She had no right to open any of the cases . "
107416	107477	107179	107179	She	348	" I say she 's dotty . She was the one that never got married , you know . Oh , I say , perhaps she thinks your books are wedding - presents to herself . Old maids are taken that way sometimes . Miss Avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust - up with Evie . "
107478	107486	107488	107488	Margaret	346	" I had n't heard of that , "
107498	107534	107179	107179	She	348	" Did n't you know she gave Evie a present last August , and Evie returned it , and then - oh , goloshes ! You never read such a letter as Miss Avery wrote . "
107535	107558	107179	107179	She	348	" But it was wrong of Evie to return it . It was n't like her to do such a heartless thing . "
107559	107567	107179	107179	She	348	" But the present was so expensive . "
107568	107578	107179	107179	She	348	" Why does that make any difference , Dolly ? "
107579	107628	107179	107179	She	348	" Still , when it costs over five pounds - I did n't see it , but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop . You ca n't very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman . Now , can you ? "
107629	107641	107179	107179	She	348	" You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married .
107642	107740	107179	107179	She	348	" Oh , mine was old earthenware stuff - not worth a halfpenny . Evie 's was quite different . You 'd have to ask anyone to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that . Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all said it was quite impossible , and when four men agree , what is a girl to do ? Evie did n't want to upset the old thing , so thought a sort of joking letter best , and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save Miss Avery trouble . "
107741	107747	107179	107179	She	348	" But Miss Avery said - "
107754	107790	107748	107748	Dolly	348	" It was a perfectly awful letter . Charles said it was the letter of a madman . In the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duckpond .
107791	107798	107179	107179	She	348	" Did she give any reasons ? "
107799	107816	107748	107748	Dolly	348	" We think she meant to be invited to Oniton , and so climb into society . "
107817	107825	107827	107827	Margaret	346	" She 's rather old for that , "
107830	107846	107827	107827	Margaret	346	" May not she have given the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother ? "
107847	107898	107748	107748	Dolly	348	" That 's a notion . Give every one their due , eh ? Well , I suppose I ought to be toddling . Come along , Mr. Muff - you want a new coat , but I do n't know who 'll give it you , I 'm sure ; "
107927	107931	107748	107748	Dolly	348	" Oh yes . "
107932	107950	107915	107915	her	348	" I wonder , then , why he let me ask her to look after the house . "

108000	108012	108013	108013	he	360	" I have patience with a man who knows his job , "
108677	108682	108684	108684	Margaret	346	" Left to itself , "
108688	108695	108684	108684	Margaret	346	" this county would vote Liberal . "
108746	108792	108738	108742	A most finished young person	3225	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox ; no , Mrs. Wilcox ; oh yes , Mrs. Wilcox , auntie received your letter quite duly . Auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment . Shall I send the servant to direct you ? "
108796	108894	108738	108742	A most finished young person	3225	" Of course , auntie does not generally look after your place ; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional . It gives her something to do . She spends quite a lot of her time there . My husband says to me sometimes , ' Where 's auntie ? ' I say , ' Need you ask ? She 's at Howards End . ' Yes , Mrs. Wilcox . Mrs. Wilcox , could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake ? Not if I cut it for you ? "
108915	108952	108738	108742	A most finished young person	3225	" I can not let you go on alone . Now do n't . You really must n't . I will direct you myself if it comes to that . I must get my hat . Now "
108956	108969	108738	108742	A most finished young person	3225	" Mrs. Wilcox , do n't you move while I 'm gone . "

109337	109343	109320	109321	the thrush	3243	" Georgia , pretty Georgia , "
109491	109494	109455	109455	Margaret	346	" Auntie ! "
109511	109522	109524	109524	Margaret	346	" Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here ? "
109526	109541	109455	109455	Margaret	346	" Oh yes , Mrs. Wilcox , quite sure . She is here daily . "
109677	109682	109684	109684	someone	3985	" Well , well ! "
109689	109700	109684	109684	someone	3985	" If it is n't Mrs. Wilcox come at last ! "
109701	109710	109663	109663	she	346	" Have you got the key , auntie ? "
109711	109717	109719	109720	Miss Avery	469	" Madge , go away , "
109725	109733	109663	109663	she	346	" Auntie , it 's Mrs. Wilcox - "
109738	109747	109734	109734	Margaret	278	" Your niece and I have come together - "
109748	109762	109663	109663	she	346	" Madge , go away . This is no moment for your hat . "
109769	109776	109777	109777	she	3260	" Auntie gets more eccentric lately , "
109781	109785	109787	109787	Margaret	278	" Miss Avery ! "
109789	109804	109787	109787	Margaret	278	" I have come about the furniture . Could you kindly let me in ? "
109805	109811	109663	109663	she	346	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox , "
109816	109820	109663	109663	she	346	" of course . "
109840	109849	109851	109851	Margaret	278	" I hope Miss Avery is not ill , "
109853	109862	109864	109864	Madge	278	" Well , if you 'll excuse me , "
109866	109892	109864	109864	Madge	278	" perhaps I ought to be leaving you now . The servants need seeing to at the farm . Auntie is so odd at times . "
109924	109934	109920	109921	Miss Avery	469	" Well , come right in , Mrs. Wilcox ! "
109940	109946	109948	109948	Margaret	278	" Thank you so much , "
109967	109975	109977	109978	Miss Avery	469	" Come right into the hall first , "
110076	110087	110088	110088	she	469	" I 'm afraid this is n't what we meant , "
110091	110147	110088	110088	she	469	" Mr. Wilcox and I never intended the cases to be touched . For instance , these books are my brother 's . We are storing them for him and for my sister , who is abroad . When you kindly undertook to look after things , we never expected you to do so much . "
110148	110157	110159	110161	the old woman	4686	" The house has been empty long enough , "
110168	110177	110178	110178	she	469	" I dare say we did n't explain , "
110182	110195	110178	110178	she	469	" It has been a mistake , and very likely our mistake . "
110196	110229	110088	110088	she	469	" Mrs. Wilcox , it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years . The house is Mrs. Wilcox 's , and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer . "
110240	110254	110237	110237	Margaret	278	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox 's house , the mother of Mr. Charles . "
110255	110260	110262	110263	Miss Avery	469	" Mistake upon mistake , "
110265	110270	110262	110263	Miss Avery	469	" Mistake upon mistake . "
110271	110279	110281	110281	Margaret	278	" Well , I do n't know , "
110292	110304	110281	110281	Margaret	278	" I really do n't know what 's to be done . "
110315	110326	110311	110312	The other	1263	" Yes , it should be a merry house enough . "
110327	110356	110311	110312	The other	1263	" I do n't know - I dare say . Well , thank you very much , Miss Avery . Yes , that 's all right . Delightful . "
110357	110364	110365	110365	She	278	" There is still the parlour . "
110392	110399	110365	110365	She	278	" And the dining - room . "
110414	110419	110420	110421	Miss Avery	469	" Then through here - "
110445	110453	110454	110454	she	469	" I 've not finished here yet , "
110459	110490	110454	110454	she	469	" There 's still a deal to do . The farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs , for there is no need to go into expense at Hilton . "
110491	110498	110500	110500	Margaret	278	" It is all a mistake , "
110511	110528	110500	110500	Margaret	278	" A misunderstanding . Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live at Howards End . "
110529	110541	110454	110454	she	469	" Oh , indeed . On account of his hay fever ? "
110542	110571	110572	110572	She	278	" We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex , and part of this furniture - my part - will go down there presently . "
110616	110636	110454	110454	she	469	" You think that you wo n't come back to live here , Mrs. Wilcox , but you will . "
110637	110644	110646	110646	Margaret	278	" That remains to be seen , "
110650	110692	110646	110646	Margaret	278	" We have no intention of doing so for the present . We happen to need a much larger house . Circumstances oblige us to give big parties . Of course , some day - one never knows , does one ? "
110697	110718	110693	110694	Miss Avery	469	" Some day ! Tcha ! tcha ! Do n't talk about some day . You are living here now . "
110719	110723	110693	110694	Miss Avery	469	" Am I ? "
110724	110744	110693	110694	Miss Avery	469	" You are living here , and have been for the last ten minutes , if you ask me . "
110841	110845	110846	110846	she	278	" The nursery , "
110976	110983	110984	110984	she	278	" It 's a beautiful meadow , "
111047	111056	111058	111059	Miss Avery	469	" Yes , the maidy 's well enough , "
111061	111074	111058	111059	Miss Avery	469	" for those that is , who do n't suffer from sneezing . "
111080	111162	111076	111076	she	469	" I 've seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time - oh , they ought to do this - they must n't do that - he 'd learn them to be lads . And just then the tickling took him . He has it from his father , with other things . There 's not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June - I laughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth . "
111163	111171	111173	111173	Margaret	346	" My brother gets hay fever too , "
111175	111213	111076	111076	she	469	" This house lies too much on the land for them . Naturally , they were glad enough to slip in at first . But Wilcoxes are better than nothing , as I see you 've found . "
111217	111235	111214	111214	Margaret	346	" They keep a place going , do n't they ? Yes , it is just that . "
111236	111247	111076	111076	she	469	" They keep England going , it is my opinion . "
111256	111305	111249	111250	Miss Avery	469	" Ay , they breed like rabbits . Well , well , it 's a funny world . But He who made it knows what He wants in it , I suppose . If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth , it is n't for us to repine . "
111306	111314	111316	111316	Margaret	346	" They breed and they also work , "
111340	111376	111316	111316	Margaret	346	" It certainly is a funny world , but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it , I think it 'll never be a bad one - never really bad . "
111377	111383	111385	111386	Miss Avery	469	" No , better'n nothing , "
111436	111509	111433	111433	she	346	" I never saw much of Ruth after her grandmother died , but we stayed civil . It was a very civil family . Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against anybody , nor let anyone be turned away without food . Then it was never ' Trespassers will be prosecuted ' in their land , but would people please not come in . Mrs. Howard was never created to run a farm . "
111510	111519	111520	111520	Margaret	346	" Had they no men to help them ? "
111527	111537	111523	111524	Miss Avery	469	" Things went on until there were no men . "
111538	111545	111547	111547	Margaret	346	" Until Mr. Wilcox came along , "
111558	111599	111547	111547	Margaret	346	" I suppose so ; but Ruth should have married a - no disrespect to you to say this , for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way , whether she got him first or no . "
111600	111607	111614	111616	the old woman	4686	" Whom should she have married ? "
111608	111612	111614	111616	the old woman	4686	" A soldier ! "
111618	111623	111614	111616	the old woman	4686	" Some real soldier . "
111649	111656	111657	111657	she	346	" But that 's all over , "
111661	111702	111657	111657	she	346	" A better time is coming now , though you 've kept me long enough waiting . In a couple of weeks I 'll see your lights shining through the hedge of an evening . Have you ordered in coals ? "
111703	111709	111711	111711	Margaret	346	" We are not coming , "
111724	111770	111716	111717	Miss Avery	469	" No . Not coming . Never coming . It has all been a mistake . The furniture must be repacked at once , and I am very sorry but I am making other arrangements , and must ask you to give me the keys . "
111771	111777	111779	111780	Miss Avery	469	" Certainly , Mrs. Wilcox , "
111937	111947	111931	111931	She	267	" to really take my tiresome chest in hand , "
112272	112285	112364	112364	Margaret	278	" Important - Margaret dear , take the Lulworth when Helen comes . "
112286	112325	112364	112364	Margaret	278	" Helen wo n't be able to stop , Aunt Juley . She has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you . She must go back to Germany as soon as you are well . "
112326	112336	112364	112364	Margaret	278	" How very odd of Helen ! Mr. Wilcox - "
112337	112342	112364	112364	Margaret	278	" Yes , dear ? "
112343	112349	112364	112364	Margaret	278	" Can he spare you ? "
112416	112421	112376	112376	her	268	" Margaret - important , "
112426	112445	112376	112376	her	268	" I should like you to have some companion to take walks with . Do try Miss Conder . "
112446	112457	112376	112376	her	268	" I have been a little walk with Miss Conder . "
112458	112472	112376	112376	her	268	" But she is not really interesting . If only you had Helen . "
112473	112481	112376	112376	her	268	" I have Tibby , Aunt Juley . "
112482	112507	112376	112376	her	268	" No , but he has to do his Chinese . Some real companion is what you need . Really , Helen is odd . "
112508	112515	112517	112517	Margaret	278	" Helen is odd , very , "
112519	112537	112376	112376	her	268	" Not content with going abroad , why does she want to go back there at once ? "
112538	112558	112376	112376	her	268	" No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us . She has not the least balance . "
112951	112953	112943	112943	her	268	" enjoyed "
113411	113416	113445	113445	She	268	" act for the best "
113611	113620	113669	113669	experts	3337	" Why do n't you tell Mr. Wilcox ? "
113621	113625	113669	113669	experts	3337	" About Helen ? "
113626	113637	113669	113669	experts	3337	" Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing . "
113638	113648	113669	113669	experts	3337	" He would do all he could , but - "
113649	113661	113669	113669	experts	3337	" Oh , you know best . But he is practical . "
113707	113719	113704	113704	Margaret	278	" Certainly not ; meet me at the bankers at four . "
113772	113779	113750	113750	her	278	" Tibby love , what next ? "
113783	113788	113780	113780	He	665	" It is extraordinary . "
113789	113810	113750	113750	her	278	" Dear , your judgment 's often clearer than mine . Have you any notion what 's at the back ? "
113811	113820	113780	113780	He	665	" None , unless it 's something mental . "
113821	113826	113828	113828	Margaret	278	" Oh - that ! "
113830	113834	113828	113828	Margaret	278	" Quite impossible . "
114200	114204	114186	114186	he	360	" just like Helen "
114212	114220	114222	114222	Margaret	278	" That is what we all say , "
114224	114249	114222	114222	Margaret	278	" But why should it be just like Helen ? Why should she be allowed to be so queer , and to grow queerer ? "
114250	114323	114324	114324	He	3350	" Do n't ask me . I 'm a plain man of business . I live and let live . My advice to you both is , do n't worry . Margaret , you 've got black marks again under your eyes . You know that 's strictly forbidden . First your aunt - then your sister . No , we are n't going to have it . Are we , Theobald ? "
114329	114359	114324	114324	He	3350	" I 'll give you some tea , and then you go straight to Ducie Street . I ca n't have my girl looking as old as her husband . "
114360	114373	114375	114375	Tibby	262	" All the same , you have not quite seen our point , "
114388	114397	114398	114398	He	261	" I do n't suppose I ever shall . "
114436	114443	114444	114444	he	665	" Margaret 's point is this , "
114447	114454	114444	114444	he	665	" Our sister may be mad . "
114468	114474	114476	114476	Margaret	278	" Come in , Charles , "
114479	114493	114476	114476	Margaret	278	" Could you help us at all ? We are again in trouble . "
114494	114522	114434	114434	her	278	" I 'm afraid I can not . What are the facts ? We are all mad more or less , you know , in these days . "
114523	114530	114532	114532	Tibby	262	" The facts are as follows , "
114542	114596	114532	114532	Tibby	262	" The facts are that she has been in England for three days and will not see us . She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address . She refuses to answer questions . Margaret finds her letters colourless . There are other facts , but these are the most striking . "
114597	114608	114610	114610	Henry	360	" She has never behaved like this before , then ? "
114612	114617	114619	114620	his wife	1450	" Of course not ! "
114626	114638	114619	114620	his wife	1450	" Well , my dear , how am I to know ? "
114648	114660	114661	114661	she	1450	" You know quite well that Helen never sins against affection , "
114664	114676	114661	114661	she	1450	" You must have noticed that much in her , surely . "
114677	114691	114619	114620	his wife	1450	" Oh yes ; she and I have always hit it off together . "
114692	114709	114661	114661	she	1450	" No , Henry - ca n't you see ? - I do n't mean that . "
114732	114845	114726	114726	he	261	" I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past , one could trace it back to the heart in the long run . She behaved oddly because she cared for someone , or wanted to help them . There 's no possible excuse for her now . She is grieving us deeply , and that is why I am sure that she is not well . ' Mad ' is too terrible a word , but she is not well . I shall never believe it . I should n't discuss my sister with you if I thought she was well - trouble you about her , I mean . "
114961	114970	114971	114971	he	360	" You want to get hold of her ? "
114974	114992	114971	114971	he	360	" That 's the problem , is n't it ? She has got to see a doctor . "
114993	115004	114953	114953	its	3359	" For all I know she has seen one already . "
115005	115014	115015	115015	He	360	" Yes , yes ; do n't interrupt . "
115060	115066	115067	115067	he	360	" I 've got it , "
115072	115092	115067	115067	he	360	" It 's perfectly easy . Leave it to me . We 'll send her down to Howards End . "
115093	115100	115219	115219	Margaret	278	" How will you do that ? "
115101	115122	115067	115067	he	360	" After her books . Tell her that she must unpack them herself . Then you can meet her there . "
115123	115154	115219	115219	Margaret	278	" But , Henry , that 's just what she wo n't let me do . It 's part of her - whatever it is - never to see me . "
115155	115218	115067	115067	he	360	" Of course you wo n't tell her you 're going . When she is there , looking at the cases , you 'll just stroll in . If nothing is wrong with her , so much the better . But there 'll be the motor round the corner , and we can run her up to a specialist in no time . "
115224	115230	115219	115219	Margaret	278	" It 's quite impossible . "
115231	115234	115219	115219	Margaret	278	" Why ? "
115235	115244	115246	115246	Tibby	262	" It does n't seem impossible to me , "
115248	115257	115246	115246	Tibby	262	" it is surely a very tippy plan . "
115258	115265	115266	115266	She	278	" It is impossible , because - "
115273	115305	115266	115266	She	278	" It 's not the particular language that Helen and I talk if you see my meaning . It would do splendidly for other people , whom I do n't blame . "
115306	115313	115315	115315	Tibby	262	" But Helen does n't talk , "
115317	115342	115315	115315	Tibby	262	" That 's our whole difficulty . She wo n't talk your particular language , and on that account you think she 's ill . "
115343	115359	115266	115266	She	278	" No , Henry ; it 's sweet of you , but I could n't . "
115360	115364	115365	115365	he	1223	" I see , "
115368	115373	115365	115365	he	1223	" you have scruples . "
115374	115379	115266	115266	She	278	" I suppose so . "
115380	115447	115365	115365	he	1223	" And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer . You could have got her down to Swanage by a word , but you had scruples . And scruples are all very well . I am as scrupulous as any man alive , I hope ; but when it is a case like this , when there is a question of madness - "
115448	115455	115266	115266	She	278	" I deny it 's madness . "
115456	115462	115365	115365	he	1223	" You said just now - "
115463	115479	115266	115266	She	278	" It 's madness when I say it , but not when you say it . "
115485	115490	115491	115491	he	360	" Margaret ! Margaret ! "
115494	115523	115491	115491	he	360	" No education can teach a woman logic . Now , my dear , my time is valuable . Do you want me to help you or not ? "
115524	115530	115480	115480	Henry	360	" Not in that way . "
115531	115544	115491	115491	he	360	" Answer my question . Plain question , plain answer . Do - "
115551	115565	115566	115566	he	261	" Pater , we may as well keep Howards End out of it , "
115569	115574	115480	115480	Henry	360	" Why , Charles ? "
115598	115608	115609	115609	he	261	" The whole house is at sixes and sevens , "
115613	115622	115609	115609	he	261	" We do n't want any more mess . "
115623	115630	115632	115633	his father	4006	" Who 's ' we ' ? "
115635	115647	115632	115633	his father	4006	" My boy , pray , who 's ' we ' ? "
115648	115657	115659	115659	Charles	261	" I am sure I beg your pardon , "
115661	115669	115659	115659	Charles	261	" I appear always to be intruding . "
115842	115870	115835	115836	Mr. Wilcox	261	" I ca n't have this sort of behaviour , my boy . Margaret 's too sweet - natured to mind , but I mind for her . "
115876	115888	115934	115934	her	3375	" Is anything wrong with you , Charles , this afternoon ? "
115889	115907	115835	115836	Mr. Wilcox	261	" No , pater ; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon . "
115908	115911	115934	115934	her	3375	" How ? "
115912	115918	115835	115836	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Do n't ask me . "
116224	116231	116233	116233	Henry	360	" She was bound to drive , "
116235	116241	116233	116233	Henry	360	" There will be her books .
116242	116250	116252	116252	Margaret	278	" I can not make it out , "
116258	116270	116233	116233	Henry	360	" Finish your coffee , dear . We must be off . "
116271	116283	116285	116285	Dolly	348	" Yes , Margaret , you know you must take plenty , "
116326	116334	116335	116335	he	1483	" You 're not fit for it , "
116339	116352	116335	116335	he	1483	" Let me go alone . I know exactly what to do . "
116353	116361	116363	116363	Margaret	278	" Oh yes , I am fit , "
116369	116437	116438	116438	She	278	" Only most frightfully worried . I can not feel that Helen is really alive . Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from someone else . Her voice is n't in them . I do n't believe your driver really saw her at the station . I wish I 'd never mentioned it . I know that Charles is vexed . Yes , he is - "
116447	116463	116438	116438	She	278	" There , Dolly will forgive me . There . Now we 'll be off . "
116479	116488	116489	116489	he	360	" Do n't you want to tidy yourself ? "
116492	116497	116464	116464	Henry	360	" Have I time ? "
116498	116503	116504	116504	She	348	" Yes , plenty . "
116527	116536	116522	116523	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Dolly , I 'm going without her . "
116558	116566	116546	116546	She	348	" Tell her I thought it best . "
116567	116576	116504	116504	She	348	" Yes , Mr. Wilcox , I see . "
116577	116586	116546	116546	She	348	" Say anything you like . All right . "
116704	116717	116701	116701	She	278	" I deserve it : I am punished for lowering my colours . "
116730	116741	116742	116742	he	261	" I still consider you are not fit for it , "
116746	116765	116701	116701	She	278	" Perhaps I was not at lunch . But the whole thing is spread clearly before me now . "
116766	116776	116701	116701	She	278	" I was meaning to act for the best . "
116777	116795	116701	116701	She	278	" Just lend me your scarf , will you ? This wind takes one 's hair so . "
116796	116808	116701	116701	She	278	" Certainly , dear girl . Are you all right now ? "
116809	116818	116701	116701	She	278	" Look ! My hands have stopped trembling . "
116819	116881	116883	116883	he	261	" And have quite forgiven me ? Then listen . Her cab should already have arrived at Howards End . We 're a little late , but no matter . Our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm , as , if possible , one does n't want a scene before servants . A certain gentleman "
116890	116920	116883	116883	he	261	" wo n't drive in , but will wait a little short of the front gate , behind the laurels . Have you still the keys of the house ? "
116921	116924	116701	116701	She	278	" Yes . "
116925	116941	116883	116883	he	261	" Well , they are n't wanted . Do you remember how the house stands ? "
116942	116945	116701	116701	She	278	" Yes . "
116946	116968	116883	116883	he	261	" If we do n't find her in the porch , we can stroll round into the garden . Our object - "
116978	117037	116701	116701	She	278	" I was just saying to my wife , Mansbridge , that our main object is not to frighten Miss Schlegel . The house , as you know , is my property , so it should seem quite natural for us to be there . The trouble is evidently nervous - would n't you say so , Margaret ? "
117077	117080	117082	117082	Margaret	278	" Nothing , "
117094	117104	117082	117082	Margaret	278	" Though she did resent my husband 's immorality . "
117105	117112	117114	117114	Henry	360	" She always was highly strung , "
117128	117158	117114	117114	Henry	360	" A tendency to spiritualism and those things , though nothing serious . Musical , literary , artistic , but I should say normal - a very charming girl . "
117217	117222	117211	117211	Schlegels	270	" Were they normal ? "
117497	117504	117506	117506	Henry	360	" Is the truant all right ? "
117514	117520	117508	117508	She	278	" Oh , my darling - "
117541	117547	117548	117548	she	278	" Yes , all right , "
117562	117569	117571	117571	Henry	360	" Margaret , you look upset ! "
117651	117663	117667	117667	his	360	" You might have given me a knock with the gate , "
117684	117688	117676	117676	She	278	" Go away . "
117696	117719	117693	117693	He	360	" Margaret , you look upset again . My dear , give me the keys . What are you doing with Helen ? "
117720	117736	117676	117676	She	278	" Oh , dearest , do go away , and I will manage it all . "
117737	117741	117693	117693	He	360	" Manage what ? "
117764	117770	117771	117771	she	278	" Stop that at least , "
117828	117837	117839	117840	her husband	1223	" Come , this is an odd beginning , "
117871	117878	117880	117880	Margaret	278	" I can not help it , "
117882	117902	117880	117880	Margaret	278	" Do wait . It 's not my fault . Please all four of you to go away now . "
117911	117924	117926	117928	the young doctor	3434	" We are relying on you to help us , Mrs. Wilcox , "
117930	117943	117926	117928	the young doctor	3434	" Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out ? "
117944	117949	117951	117951	Margaret	278	" On what grounds ? "
117975	118013	117967	117967	he	360	" I beg your pardon , but it is nothing of the sort . You are not qualified to attend my sister , Mr. Mansbridge . If we require your services , we will let you know . "
118014	118026	118027	118027	he	360	" I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish , "
118030	118051	117967	117967	he	360	" You could , but you have not . You are , therefore , not qualified to attend my sister . "
118052	118059	118061	118061	Henry	360	" Come , come , Margaret ! "
118068	118089	118061	118061	Henry	360	" This is a terrible business , an appalling business . It 's doctor 's orders . Open the door . "
118090	118099	117967	117967	he	360	" Forgive me , but I will not . "
118100	118106	118061	118061	Henry	360	" I do n't agree . "
118111	118122	118124	118125	the doctor	666	" This business is as broad as it 's long , "
118127	118147	118124	118125	the doctor	666	" We had better all work together . You need us , Mrs. Wilcox , and we need you . "
118148	118152	118154	118154	Henry	360	" Quite so , "
118156	118166	118168	118168	Margaret	278	" I do not need you in the least , "
118179	118195	118124	118125	the doctor	666	" No more does my sister , who is still many weeks from her confinement . "
118196	118201	118170	118172	The two men	1559	" Margaret , Margaret ! "
118202	118219	118124	118125	the doctor	666	" Well , Henry , send your doctor away . What possible use is he now ? "
118256	118264	118266	118266	Margaret	278	" It all turns on affection now , "
118268	118276	118266	118266	Margaret	278	" Affection . Do n't you see ? "
118293	118345	118282	118282	she	278	" Surely you see . I like Helen very much , you not so much . Mr. Mansbridge does n't know her . That 's all . And affection , when reciprocated , gives rights . Put that down in your notebook , Mr. Mansbridge . It 's a useful formula . "
118353	118363	118365	118365	Margaret	278	" You do n't know what you want yourselves , "
118371	118413	118365	118365	Margaret	278	" For one sensible remark I will let you in . But you can not make it . You would trouble my sister for no reason . I will not permit it . I 'll stand here all the day sooner . "
118414	118417	118419	118419	Henry	360	" Mansbridge , "
118425	118430	118419	118419	Henry	360	" perhaps not now . "
118452	118459	118460	118460	she	278	" Now , Henry , you , "
118474	118507	118460	118460	she	278	" Go away now , dear . I shall want your advice later , no doubt . Forgive me if I have been cross . But , seriously , you must go . "
118530	118541	118542	118542	she	278	" I shall soon find you down at Dolly 's , "
118618	118624	118625	118625	she	278	" Oh , my darling ! "
118628	118635	118625	118625	she	278	" My darling , forgive me . "
118677	118699	118662	118662	Helen	479	" Convenient ! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked . I have found nearly everything that I want .
118700	118709	118654	118654	she	278	" I told you nothing that was true . "
118710	118726	118662	118662	Helen	479	" It has been a great surprise , certainly . Has Aunt Juley been ill ? "
118727	118739	118654	118654	she	278	" Helen , you would n't think I 'd invent that ? "
118740	118745	118747	118747	Helen	479	" I suppose not , "
118758	118768	118747	118747	Helen	479	" But one loses faith in everything after this . "
118769	118786	118654	118654	she	278	" We thought it was illness , but even then - I have n't behaved worthily . "
118792	118810	118654	118654	she	278	" I ought not to have consulted anyone . What would our father have thought of me ? "
118862	118869	118871	118871	Helen	479	" Yes , I am annoyed , "
118873	118915	118871	118871	Helen	479	" My wishes should have been respected . I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary , but after Aunt Juley recovered , it was not necessary . Planning my life , as I now have to do - "
118916	118923	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" Come away from those books , "
118927	118935	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" Helen , do talk to me . "
118936	118957	118959	118959	she	479	" I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard . One ca n't go through a great deal of "
118965	119068	118959	118959	she	479	" without planning one 's actions in advance . I am going to have a child in June , and in the first place conversations , discussions , excitement , are not good for me . I will go through them if necessary , but only then . In the second place I have no right to trouble people . I can not fit in with England as I know it . I have done something that the English never pardon . It would not be right for them to pardon it . So I must live where I am not known . "
119069	119080	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" But why did n't you tell me , dearest ? "
119081	119084	119086	119086	Helen	479	" Yes , "
119089	119099	119086	119086	Helen	479	" I might have , but decided to wait . "
119100	119110	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" I believe you would never have told me . "
119111	119126	119086	119086	Helen	479	" Oh yes , I should . We have taken a flat in Munich . "
119133	119160	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" By ' we ' I mean myself and Monica . But for her , I am and have been and always wish to be alone . "
119161	119169	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" I have not heard of Monica . "
119170	119211	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" You would n't have . She 's an Italian - by birth at least . She makes her living by journalism . I met her originally on Garda . Monica is much the best person to see me through . "
119212	119222	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" You are very fond of her , then . "
119223	119232	118925	118925	Margaret	278	" She has been extraordinarily sensible with me . "
119240	119243	119244	119244	they	3453	" Italiano Inglesiato "
119272	119283	119285	119285	Helen	479	" You must not think that we shall never meet , "
119292	119383	119285	119285	Helen	479	" I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared , and the longer you can be with me the better . But you have n't understood yet , Meg , and of course it is very difficult for you . This is a shock to you . It is n't to me , who have been thinking over our futures for many months , and they wo n't be changed by a slight contretemps , such as this . I can not live in England . "
119384	119407	119435	119435	she	3456	" Helen , you 've not forgiven me for my treachery . You COULDN'T talk like this to me if you had . "
119408	119421	119422	119422	She	3456	" Oh , Meg dear , why do we talk at all ? "
119438	119453	119435	119435	she	3456	" Tell me , how is it that all the books are down here ? "
119454	119459	119435	119435	she	3456	" Series of mistakes . "
119460	119472	119435	119435	she	3456	" And a great deal of the furniture has been unpacked . "
119473	119476	119435	119435	she	3456	" All . "
119477	119484	119435	119435	she	3456	" Who lives here , then ? "
119485	119489	119435	119435	she	3456	" No one . "
119490	119499	119435	119435	she	3456	" I suppose you are letting it though - "
119500	119506	119508	119508	Margaret	278	" The house is dead , "
119513	119520	119508	119508	Margaret	278	" Why worry on about it ? "
119521	119580	119435	119435	she	3456	" But I am interested . You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life . I am still Helen , I hope . Now this has n't the feel of a dead house . The hall seems more alive even than in the old days , when it held the Wilcoxes ' own things . "
119581	119623	119624	119624	She	3457	" Interested , are you ? Very well , I must tell you , I suppose . My husband lent it on condition we - but by a mistake all our things were unpacked , and Miss Avery , instead of - "
119627	119664	119624	119624	She	3457	" Look here , I ca n't go on like this . I warn you I wo n't . Helen , why should you be so miserably unkind to me , simply because you hate Henry ? "
119665	119673	119675	119675	Helen	479	" I do n't hate him now , "
119677	119732	119675	119675	Helen	479	" I have stopped being a schoolgirl , and , Meg , once again , I 'm not being unkind . But as for fitting in with your English life - no , put it out of your head at once . Imagine a visit from me at Ducie Street ! It 's unthinkable . "
119807	119813	119815	119815	Helen	479	" Tell me about yourself , "
119830	119837	119815	119815	Helen	479	" There 's nothing to tell . "
119838	119848	119815	119815	Helen	479	" But your marriage has been happy , Meg ? "
119849	119861	119815	119815	Helen	479	" Yes , but I do n't feel inclined to talk . "
119862	119869	119815	119815	Helen	479	" You feel as I do . "
119870	119879	119815	119815	Helen	479	" Not that , but I ca n't . "
119880	119895	119815	119815	Helen	479	" No more can I. It is a nuisance , but no good trying . "
119949	119960	120095	120095	Margaret	278	" Look here , Meg , is the coast clear ? "
119961	119973	120052	120052	Helen	479	" You mean that you want to go away from me ? "
119974	120026	120095	120095	Margaret	278	" I suppose so - dear old lady ! it is n't any use . I knew we should have nothing to say . Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby , and take more yourself than I can say . Promise to come and see me in Munich later . "
120027	120032	120052	120052	Helen	479	" Certainly , dearest . "
120033	120042	120095	120095	Margaret	278	" For that is all we can do . "
120065	120077	120078	120078	She	479	" I am glad to have seen you and the things . "
120103	120115	120100	120100	She	278	" The car has gone , and here 's your cab . "
120152	120160	120139	120147	The driver , who was leaning on the gate	3463	" Please , lady , a message , "
120173	120179	120180	120180	she	278	" How did this come ? "
120227	120235	120215	120215	she	278	" Il faut dormir sur ce sujet . "
120242	120249	120215	120215	she	278	" une comfortable chambre a l'hotel . "
120278	120287	120288	120288	she	278	" Henry would have done what he could , "
120336	120344	120345	120345	she	278	" This is Mr. Wilcox 's house ? "
120348	120355	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Surely you remember Howards End ? "
120356	120372	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Remember ? I who remember everything ! But it looks to be ours now . "
120373	120379	120381	120381	Margaret	278	" Miss Avery was extraordinary , "
120413	120443	120408	120408	she	278	" She loved Mrs. Wilcox , and would rather furnish her house with our things than think of it empty . In consequence here are all the library books . "
120444	120476	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Not all the books . She has n't unpacked the Art Books , in which she may show her sense . And we never used to have the sword here . "
120477	120485	120408	120408	she	278	" The sword looks well , though . "
120486	120489	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Magnificent . "
120490	120497	120408	120408	she	278	" Yes , does n't it ? "
120498	120506	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Where 's the piano , Meg ? "
120507	120516	120408	120408	she	278	" I warehoused that in London . Why ? "
120517	120520	120328	120330	the old Helen	479	" Nothing . "
120521	120531	120408	120408	she	278	" Curious , too , that the carpet fits . "
120532	120539	120541	120541	Helen	479	" The carpet 's a mistake , "
120543	120567	120541	120541	Helen	479	" I know that we had it in London , but this floor ought to be bare . It is far too beautiful . "
120568	120598	120408	120408	she	278	" You still have a mania for under - furnishing . Would you care to come into the dining - room before you start ? There 's no carpet there .
120612	120623	120625	120625	Helen	479	" Oh , WHAT a place for mother 's chiffonier ! "
120627	120635	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Look at the chairs , though . "
120636	120652	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Oh , look at them ! Wickham Place faced north , did n't it ? "
120653	120658	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" North - west . "
120659	120685	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Anyhow , it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun . Feel . Their little backs are quite warm . "
120686	120702	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners ? I shall just - "
120703	120721	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Over here , Meg . Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn . "
120733	120744	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Ye - es . The window 's too high . "
120745	120753	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Try a drawing - room chair . "
120754	120784	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" No , I do n't like the drawing - room so much . The beam has been match - boarded . It would have been so beautiful otherwise . "
120785	120827	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Helen , what a memory you have for some things ! You 're perfectly right . It 's a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women . Men do n't know what we want - "
120828	120833	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" And never will . "
120834	120848	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" I do n't agree . In two thousand years they 'll know . "
120849	120864	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" But the chairs show up wonderfully . Look where Tibby spilt the soup . "
120865	120873	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Coffee . It was coffee surely . "
120879	120895	120874	120874	Helen	479	" Impossible . Tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time . "
120896	120901	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Was Father alive ? "
120902	120905	120874	120874	Helen	479	" Yes . "
120906	120991	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" Then you 're right and it must have been soup . I was thinking of much later - that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley 's , when she did n't realize that Tibby had grown up . It was coffee then , for he threw it down on purpose . There was some rhyme , ' Tea , coffee - coffee , tea , ' that she said to him every morning at breakfast . Wait a minute - how did it go ? "
120992	121009	120874	120874	Helen	479	" I know - no , I do n't . What a detestable boy Tibby was ! "
121010	121028	120722	120722	Margaret	278	" But the rhyme was simply awful . No decent person could have put up with it . "
121029	121036	121038	121038	Helen	479	" Ah , that greengage tree , "
121051	121077	121038	121038	Helen	479	" Why do I connect it with dumbbells ? And there come the chickens . The grass wants cutting . I love yellow - hammers - "
121082	121088	121089	121089	she	278	" I have got it , "
121106	121120	121166	121166	Helen	479	" That every morning for three weeks . No wonder Tibby was wild . "
121121	121129	121131	121131	Helen	479	" Tibby is moderately a dear now , "
121133	121153	121166	121166	Helen	479	" There ! I knew you 'd say that in the end . Of course he 's a dear . "
121158	121165	121166	121166	Helen	479	" Listen ! what 's that ? "
121169	121178	121166	121166	Helen	479	" Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege . "
121179	121185	121166	121166	Helen	479	" What nonsense - listen ! "
121299	121305	121296	121296	She	479	" It is always Meg . "
121364	121373	121417	121417	she	278	" Little boy , what do you want ? "
121374	121382	121417	121417	she	278	" Please , I am the milk . "
121383	121390	121392	121392	Margaret	278	" Did Miss Avery send you ? "
121397	121402	121417	121417	she	278	" Yes , please . "
121403	121415	121417	121417	she	278	" Then take it back and say we require no milk . "
121422	121441	121417	121417	she	278	" No , it 's not the siege , but possibly an attempt to provision us against one . "
121442	121448	121450	121450	Helen	479	" But I like milk , "
121452	121458	121450	121450	Helen	479	" Why send it away ? "
121459	121483	121417	121417	she	278	" Do you ? Oh , very well . But we 've nothing to put it in , and he wants the can . "
121484	121498	121500	121501	the boy	753	" Please , I 'm to call in the morning for the can , "
121503	121512	121417	121417	she	278	" The house will be locked up then . "
121513	121524	121417	121417	she	278	" In the morning would I bring eggs , too ? "
121525	121540	121417	121417	she	278	" Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week ? "
121547	121557	121417	121417	she	278	" Well , run away and do it again . "
121558	121563	121565	121565	Helen	479	" Nice little boy , "
121567	121580	121565	121565	Helen	479	" I say , what 's your name ? Mine 's Helen . "
121581	121584	121417	121417	she	278	" Tom . "
121612	121630	121417	121417	she	278	" Tom , this one here is Margaret . And at home we 've another called Tibby . "
121631	121638	121640	121640	Tom	471	" Mine are lop - eared , "
121649	121673	121417	121417	she	278	" You 're a very good and rather a clever little boy . Mind you come again . - Is n't he charming ? "
121674	121677	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" Undoubtedly , "
121681	121702	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" He is probably the son of Madge , and Madge is dreadful . But this place has wonderful powers . "
121703	121709	121417	121417	she	278	" What do you mean ? "
121710	121716	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" I do n't know . "
121717	121725	121417	121417	she	278	" Because I probably agree with you . "
121726	121739	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live . "
121740	121745	121747	121747	Helen	479	" I do agree , "
121755	121770	121747	121747	Helen	479	" But you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago . "
121771	121782	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" Meaning that I was dead . I felt it . "
121783	121843	121747	121747	Helen	479	" Yes , the house has a surer life than we , even if it was empty , and , as it is , I ca n't get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture . After all , Wickham Place was a grave . Meg , I 've a startling idea . "
121844	121849	121679	121679	Margaret	278	" What is it ? "
121850	121858	121747	121747	Helen	479	" Drink some milk to steady you . "
121862	121872	121874	121874	Helen	479	" No , I wo n't tell you yet , "
121876	121897	121874	121874	Helen	479	" because you may laugh or be angry . Let 's go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing . "
121961	121968	121947	121947	She	479	" Then one would see really . "
121999	122018	121996	121996	she	479	" About my idea . Could n't you and I camp out in this house for the night ? "
122019	122030	122032	122032	Margaret	278	" I do n't think we could well do that , "
122034	122043	121996	121996	she	479	" Here are beds , tables , towels - "
122044	122065	121996	121996	she	479	" I know ; but the house is n't supposed to be slept in , and Henry 's suggestion was - "
122066	122115	121996	121996	she	479	" I require no suggestions . I shall not alter anything in my plans . But it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you . It will be something to look back on . Oh , Meg lovey , do let 's ! "
122116	122124	122126	122126	Margaret	278	" But , Helen , my pet , "
122128	122166	122126	122126	Margaret	278	" we ca n't without getting Henry 's leave . Of course , he would give it , but you said yourself that you could n't visit at Ducie Street now , and this is equally intimate . "
122167	122218	121996	121996	she	479	" Ducie Street is his house . This is ours . Our furniture , our sort of people coming to the door . Do let us camp out , just one night , and Tom shall feed us on eggs and milk . Why not ? It 's a moon . "
122222	122231	122232	122232	she	278	" I feel Charles would n't like it , "
122237	122292	122232	122232	she	278	" Even our furniture annoyed him , and I was going to clear it out when Aunt Juley 's illness prevented me . I sympathize with Charles . He feels it 's his mother 's house . He loves it in rather an untaking way . Henry I could answer for - not Charles . "
122293	122302	122304	122304	Helen	479	" I know he wo n't like it , "
122306	122343	122304	122304	Helen	479	" But I am going to pass out of their lives . What difference will it make in the long run if they say , ' And she even spent the night at Howards End ' ? "
122344	122364	122232	122232	she	278	" How do you know you 'll pass out of their lives ? We have thought that twice before . "
122365	122370	122304	122304	Helen	479	" Because my plans - "
122371	122380	122232	122232	she	278	" - which you change in a moment . "
122381	122393	122395	122395	Helen	479	" Then because my life is great and theirs are little , "
122400	122473	122395	122395	Helen	479	" I know of things they ca n't know of , and so do you . We know that there 's poetry . We know that there 's death . They can only take them on hearsay . We know this is our house , because it feels ours . Oh , they may take the title - deeds and the doorkeys , but for this one night we are at home . "
122474	122486	122488	122488	Margaret	278	" It would be lovely to have you once more alone , "
122490	122500	122488	122488	Margaret	278	" It may be a chance in a thousand . "
122501	122509	122510	122510	She	278	" Yes , and we could talk . "
122515	122550	122510	122510	She	278	" It wo n't be a very glorious story . But under that wych - elm - honestly , I see little happiness ahead . Can not I have this one night with you ? "
122551	122564	122488	122488	Margaret	278	" I need n't say how much it would mean to me . "
122565	122570	122510	122510	She	278	" Then let us . "
122571	122589	122488	122488	Margaret	278	" It is no good hesitating . Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get leave ? "
122590	122599	122510	122510	She	278	" Oh , we do n't want leave . "
122662	122668	122670	122670	Helen	479	" Charles may say no , "
122672	122679	122670	122670	Helen	479	" We sha n't consult him . "
122680	122693	122733	122733	Margaret	278	" Go if you like ; I should have stopped without leave . "
122737	122766	122733	122733	Margaret	278	" Expect me back before dark . I am looking forward to it so much . It is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing . "
122767	122776	122778	122778	Helen	479	" Not a thing , only an ending , "
122908	122911	122902	122902	Dolly	348	" told , "
122940	122955	122956	122956	she	278	" But the diddums ca n't listen ; he is n't nine months old , "
122959	122968	122970	122975	her father - in - law	1483	" That 's not what I was saying , "
123003	123010	123011	123011	he	360	" Is it what we feared ? "
123014	123018	122970	122975	her father - in - law	1483	" It is . "
123019	123023	123024	123024	he	360	" Dear girl , "
123027	123052	123024	123024	he	360	" there is a troublesome business ahead of us , and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through . "
123058	123131	123055	123055	her	278	" I am obliged to question you on subjects we 'd both prefer to leave untouched . As you know , I am not one of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred . To speak as I must will pain me , but there are occasions - We are husband and wife , not children . I am a man of the world , and you are a most exceptional woman . "
123166	123209	123160	123160	he	3499	" I see that you feel as I felt when - My poor little wife ! Oh , be brave ! Just one or two questions , and I have done with you . Was your sister wearing a wedding - ring ? "
123213	123216	123210	123210	Margaret	278	" No . "
123223	123237	123210	123210	Margaret	278	" Henry , I really came to ask a favour about Howards End . "
123238	123258	123259	123259	She	278	" One point at a time . I am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer . "
123294	123299	123300	123300	he	3502	" Take your time , "
123304	123317	123300	123300	he	3502	" Remember that this is far worse for me than for you . "
123338	123352	123334	123334	she	278	" Seducer ? No ; I do not know her seducer 's name . "
123353	123360	123300	123300	he	3502	" Would she not tell you ? "
123361	123371	123373	123373	Margaret	278	" I never even asked her who seduced her , "
123382	123387	123389	123389	he	3502	" That is singular . "
123394	123449	123389	123389	he	3502	" Natural perhaps , dear girl , that you should n't ask . But until his name is known , nothing can be done . Sit down . How terrible it is to see you so upset ! I knew you were n't fit for it . I wish I had n't taken you . "
123453	123477	123450	123450	Margaret	278	" I like to stand , if you do n't mind , for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six Hills . "
123478	123483	123300	123300	he	3502	" As you like . "
123484	123495	123450	123450	Margaret	278	" Have you anything else to ask me , Henry ? "
123496	123546	123300	123300	he	3502	" Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything . I have often noticed your insight , dear . I only wish my own was as good . You may have guessed something , even though your sister said nothing . The slightest hint would help us . "
123547	123554	123450	123450	Margaret	278	" Who is ' we ' ? "
123555	123565	123300	123300	he	3502	" I thought it best to ring up Charles . "
123566	123571	123573	123573	Margaret	278	" That was unnecessary , "
123578	123587	123573	123573	Margaret	278	" This news will give Charles disproportionate pain . "
123588	123600	123300	123300	he	3502	" He has at once gone to call on your brother . "
123601	123607	123573	123573	Margaret	278	" That too was unnecessary . "
123608	123656	123300	123300	he	3502	" Let me explain , dear , how the matter stands . You do n't think that I and my son are other than gentlemen ? It is in Helen 's interests that we are acting . It is still not too late to save her name . "
123666	123676	123677	123677	she	278	" Are we to make her seducer marry her ? "
123680	123686	123573	123573	Margaret	278	" If possible . Yes . "
123687	123708	123300	123300	he	3502	" But , Henry , suppose he turned out to be married already ? One has heard of such cases . "
123709	123731	123573	123573	Margaret	278	" In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct , and be thrashed within an inch of his life . "
123794	123803	123791	123791	she	278	" May I ask you my question now ? "
123804	123810	123791	123791	she	278	" Certainly , my dear . "
123811	123818	123791	123791	she	278	" Tomorrow Helen goes to Munich - "
123819	123827	123791	123791	she	278	" Well , possibly she is right . "
123828	123855	123791	123791	she	278	" Henry , let a lady finish . Tomorrow she goes ; tonight , with your permission , she would like to sleep at Howards End . "
123918	123923	123924	123924	he	360	" Why Howards End ? "
123929	123945	123924	123924	he	360	" Would she not be more comfortable , as I suggested , at the hotel ? "
123953	123974	123946	123946	Margaret	278	" It is an odd request , but you know what Helen is and what women in her state are . "
123982	124052	123975	123975	He	360	" She has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good . I think she 's right . Being one of those imaginative girls , the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her . This is a fact . It is the end of her girlhood . Her last words to me were , ' A beautiful ending . ' "
124053	124066	124164	124164	he	3504	" She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons , in fact . "
124067	124085	123975	123975	He	360	" Exactly . You have quite understood . It is her last hope of being with it . "
124086	124162	124164	124164	he	3504	" I do n't agree there , my dear ! Helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes - possibly more than her share , for you are so fond of her that you 'd give her anything of yours that she fancies , would n't you ? and I 'd raise no objection . I could understand it if it was her old home , because a home , or a house "
124179	124244	124164	124164	he	3504	" because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred , I do n't know why . Associations and so on . Now Helen has no associations with Howards End , though I and Charles and Evie have . I do not see why she wants to stay the night there . She will only catch cold . "
124245	124254	124256	124256	Margaret	278	" Leave it that you do n't see , "
124258	124280	124256	124256	Margaret	278	" Call it fancy . But realize that fancy is a scientific fact . Helen is fanciful , and wants to . "
124296	124324	124290	124290	He	3504	" If she wants to sleep one night , she may want to sleep two . We shall never get her out of the house , perhaps . "
124325	124328	124330	124330	Margaret	278	" Well ? "
124338	124363	124330	124330	Margaret	278	" And suppose we do n't get her out of the house ? Would it matter ? She would do no one any harm . "
124369	124374	124375	124375	she	278	" No , Henry , "
124380	124405	124375	124375	she	278	" I did n't mean that . We will only trouble Howards End for this one night . I take her to London tomorrow - "
124406	124419	124290	124290	He	3504	" Do you intend to sleep in a damp house , too ? "
124420	124428	124375	124375	she	278	" She can not be left alone . "
124429	124445	124290	124290	He	3504	" That 's quite impossible ! Madness . You must be here to meet Charles . "
124446	124469	124375	124375	she	278	" I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary , and I have no desire to meet him . "
124470	124476	124290	124290	He	3504	" Margaret - my Margaret - "
124477	124504	124375	124375	she	278	" What has this business to do with Charles ? If it concerns me little , it concerns you less , and Charles not at all . "
124505	124514	124516	124517	Mr. Wilcox	261	" As the future owner of Howards End , "
124523	124533	124520	124520	his	261	" I should say that it did concern Charles . "
124534	124547	124375	124375	she	278	" In what way ? Will Helen 's condition depreciate the property ? "
124548	124557	124520	124520	his	261	" My dear , you are forgetting yourself . "
124558	124567	124375	124375	she	278	" I think you yourself recommended plain speaking . "
124584	124590	124592	124592	Henry	360	" Helen commands my sympathy , "
124594	124649	124592	124592	Henry	360	" As your husband , I shall do all for her that I can , and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning . But I can not treat her as if nothing has happened . I should be false to my position in society if I did . "
124658	124670	124671	124671	she	3507	" No , let us go back to Helen 's request , "
124674	124772	124671	124671	she	3507	" It is unreasonable , but the request of an unhappy girl . Tomorrow she will go to Germany , and trouble society no longer . Tonight she asks to sleep in your empty house - a house which you do not care about , and which you have not occupied for over a year . May she ? Will you give my sister leave ? Will you forgive her - as you hope to be forgiven , and as you have actually been forgiven ? Forgive her for one night only . That will be enough . "
124773	124782	124809	124809	her	278	" As I have actually been forgiven - ? "
124783	124795	124797	124797	Margaret	278	" Never mind for the moment what I mean by that , "
124799	124804	124797	124797	Margaret	278	" Answer my question . "
124831	124895	124828	124828	he	3508	" I seem rather unaccommodating , but I have some experience of life , and know how one thing leads to another . I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel . I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider . I am sorry , but see that she leaves my house at once . "
124896	124902	124947	124947	Margaret	278	" You mentioned Mrs. Wilcox . "
124903	124909	124828	124828	he	3508	" I beg your pardon ? "
124910	124924	124947	124947	Margaret	278	" A rare occurrence . In reply , may I mention Mrs. Bast ? "
124925	124934	124936	124936	Henry	360	" You have not been yourself all day , "
124961	124968	124969	124969	she	278	" Not any more of this ! "
124972	125170	124969	124969	she	278	" You shall see the connection if it kills you , Henry ! You have had a mistress - I forgave you . My sister has a lover - you drive her from the house . Do you see the connection ? Stupid , hypocritical , cruel - oh , contemptible ! - a man who insults his wife when she 's alive and cants with her memory when she 's dead . A man who ruins a woman for his pleasure , and casts her off to ruin other men . And gives bad financial advice , and then says he is not responsible . These , man , are you . You ca n't recognize them , because you can not connect . I 've had enough of your unweeded kindness . I 've spoilt you long enough . All your life you have been spoiled . Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you . No one has ever told what you are - muddled , criminally muddled . Men like you use repentance as a blind , so do n't repent . Only say to yourself , ' What Helen has done , I 've done . ' "
125171	125178	125179	125179	Henry	360	" The two cases are different , "
125205	125253	124969	124969	she	278	" In what way different ? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox , Helen only herself . You remain in society , Helen ca n't . You have had only pleasure , she may die . You have the insolence to talk to me of differences , Henry ? "
125266	125329	125261	125261	Henry	360	" I perceive you are attempting blackmail . It is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband . My rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats , and I can only repeat what I said before : I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at Howards End . "
125898	125911	125894	125894	he	3543	" I suppose you realize that you are your sister 's protector ? "
125912	125917	125894	125894	he	3543	" In what sense ? "
125918	125943	125894	125894	he	3543	" If a man played about with my sister , I 'd send a bullet through him , but perhaps you do n't mind . "
125944	125950	125952	125952	Tibby	262	" I mind very much , "
125954	125971	125894	125894	he	3543	" Who d'ye suspect , then ? Speak out , man . One always suspects someone . "
125972	125982	125984	125984	he	262	" No one . I do n't think so . "
125997	126003	126005	126005	Charles	528	" You are hiding something , "
126019	126038	126039	126039	he	262	" When you saw her last , did she mention anyone 's name ? Yes , or no ! "
126047	126060	126005	126005	Charles	528	" In my rooms she mentioned some friends , called the Basts - "
126061	126067	126005	126005	Charles	528	" Who are the Basts ? "
126068	126079	126005	126005	Charles	528	" People - friends of hers at Evie 's wedding . "
126080	126140	126005	126005	Charles	528	" I do n't remember . But , by great Scott ! I do . My aunt told me about some tag - rag . Was she full of them when you saw her ? Is there a man ? Did she speak of the man ? Or - look here - have you had any dealings with him ? "
126223	126255	126196	126196	He	262	" I see - you are in his confidence . They met at your rooms . Oh , what a family , what a family ! God help the poor pater - "
126638	126642	126644	126644	Helen	257	" One isolates , "
126647	126692	126644	126644	Helen	257	" I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other forces that were pulling Leonard downhill . Consequently , I was full of pity , and almost of revenge . For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only , and so , when your letters came - "
126693	126701	126703	126703	Margaret	278	" I need never have written them , "
126705	126725	126703	126703	Margaret	278	" They never shielded Henry . How hopeless it is to tidy away the past , even for others ! "
126726	126742	126644	126644	Helen	257	" I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts . "
126743	126753	126703	126703	Margaret	278	" Looking back , that was wrong of me . "
126754	127028	126644	126644	Helen	257	" Looking back , darling , I know that it was right . It is right to save the man whom one loves . I am less enthusiastic about justice now . But we both thought you wrote at his dictation . It seemed the last touch of his callousness . Being very much wrought up by this time - and Mrs. Bast was upstairs . I had not seen her , and had talked for a long time to Leonard - I had snubbed him for no reason , and that should have warned me I was in danger . So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation . He said that he guessed the explanation - he knew of it , and you must n't know . I pressed him to tell me . He said no one must know ; it was something to do with his wife . Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast and Miss Schlegel . I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when I saw his eyes , and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two ways , not one . I drew him to me . I made him tell me . I felt very lonely myself . He is not to blame . He would have gone on worshipping me . I want never to see him again , though it sounds appalling . I wanted to give him money and feel finished . Oh , Meg , the little that is known about these things ! "
127037	127070	127029	127029	She	3562	" The little , too , that is known about growth ! Both times it was loneliness , and the night , and panic afterwards . Did Leonard grow out of Paul ? "
127126	127135	127136	127136	she	278	" Leonard is a better growth than madness , "
127139	127156	127136	127136	she	278	" I was afraid that you would react against Paul until you went over the verge . "
127157	127222	127235	127235	her	479	" I did react until I found poor Leonard . I am steady now . I sha n't ever like your Henry , dearest Meg , or even speak kindly about him , but all that blinding hate is over . I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any more . I understand how you married him , and you will now be very happy . "
127228	127231	127233	127233	Helen	479	" Yes , "
127241	127248	127235	127235	her	479	" I do at last understand . "
127249	127263	127235	127235	her	479	" Except Mrs. Wilcox , dearest , no one understands our little movements . "
127264	127272	127235	127235	her	479	" Because in death - I agree . "
127273	127393	127235	127235	her	479	" Not quite . I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that woman 's mind . She knows everything . She is everything . She is the house , and the tree that leans over it . People have their own deaths as well as their own lives , and even if there is nothing beyond death , we shall differ in our nothingness . I can not believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine . She knew about realities . She knew when people were in love , though she was not in the room . I do n't doubt that she knew when Henry deceived her . "
127394	127402	127235	127235	her	479	" Good - night , Mrs. Wilcox , "
127407	127417	127235	127235	her	479	" Oh , good - night , Miss Avery . "
127418	127427	127428	127428	Helen	479	" Why should Miss Avery work for us ? "
127431	127436	127235	127235	her	479	" Why , indeed ? "
127495	127504	127506	127506	Helen	479	" This is not quite our house yet , "
127508	127524	127506	127506	Helen	479	" When Miss Avery called , I felt we are only a couple of tourists . "
127525	127536	127610	127610	Margaret	278	" We shall be that everywhere , and for ever . "
127537	127542	127506	127506	Helen	479	" But affectionate tourists - "
127543	127554	127610	127610	Margaret	278	" But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home . "
127555	127563	127565	127565	Helen	479	" I ca n't pretend very long , "
127567	127609	127565	127565	Helen	479	" Sitting under this tree one forgets , but I know that tomorrow I shall see the moon rise out of Germany . Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case . Unless you will come with me . "
127677	127695	127667	127667	She	278	" Are you serious in asking me , Helen ? Should I get on with your Monica ? "
127696	127709	127667	127667	She	278	" You would not , but I am serious in asking you . "
127710	127723	127667	127667	She	278	" Still , no more plans now . And no more reminiscences . "
127804	127808	127810	127810	Margaret	278	" Sleep now , "
127864	127867	127890	127890	their	3566	" now , "
127869	127871	127890	127890	their	3566	" now "
127881	127884	127890	127890	their	3566	" now , "
128045	128056	128039	128039	he	3877	" Brute - you brute , I could n't have - "
128154	128166	128138	128138	He	3877	" Oh what SHALL I do , whatever SHALL I do ? "
128658	128670	128643	128643	he	317	" There is nothing to choose between us , after all . "
128800	128806	128808	128808	Blanche	555	" A letter from Leonard , "
128813	128820	128808	128808	Blanche	555	" and after all this time . "
128860	128866	128868	128870	the other sister	3602	" A letter from Leonard ! "
128988	129003	128978	128978	Laura	556	" She minds that ! What would she say if she knew the truth ? "
129906	129918	129900	129901	the clerks	3641	" Excuse me , sir , but is your boss married ? "
129927	129934	129924	129924	some	1595	" What 's that to you ? "
130089	130096	130097	130097	he	317	" Does Mrs. Wilcox live here ? "
130100	130105	130125	130126	the parlourmaid	3649	" She 's out , "
130110	130117	130125	130126	the parlourmaid	3649	" When will she be back ? "
130118	130123	130125	130126	the parlourmaid	3649	" I 'll ask , "
130201	130216	130197	130197	He	262	" I do n't know . Hilton . Howards End . Who is it ? "
130217	130224	130252	130252	her	278	" I 'll ask , sir . "
130225	130232	130197	130197	He	262	" No , do n't bother . "
130233	130243	130248	130248	Leonard	317	" They have taken the car to Howards End , "
130261	130272	130273	130273	she	278	" You appear to want to know a good deal , "
130299	130307	130285	130285	She	278	" Is it a village , please ? "
130308	130340	130285	130285	She	278	" Village ! It 's Mr. Wilcox 's private house - at least , it 's one of them . Mrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there . Hilton is the village . "
130341	130351	130285	130285	She	278	" Yes . And when will they be back ? "
130352	130368	130369	130369	She	278	" Mr. Schlegel does n't know . We ca n't know everything , can we ? "
130467	130479	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Why horrible ? It 's ordinary light from the room . "
130480	130485	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" But it moves . "
130486	130492	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" So does the moon . "
130493	130501	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" But it is a clenched fist . "
130502	130506	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Why not ? "
130507	130516	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" But it is going to touch me . "
130517	130521	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Let it . "
130549	130557	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Is there life in the moon ? "
130558	130562	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Of course . "
130563	130571	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" But I thought it was uninhabited . "
130572	130586	130462	130464	Part of him	3658	" Not by Time , Death , Judgment , and the smaller snakes . "
130587	130591	130593	130593	Leonard	317	" Smaller snakes ! "
130598	130603	130593	130593	Leonard	317	" What a notion ! "
130654	130668	130669	130669	She	3660	" I say , Jacky , I 'm going out for a bit . "
130831	130841	130828	130828	her	3660	" Hullo , Len ! What ho , Len ! "
130842	130853	130826	130826	Jacky	325	" What ho , Jacky ! see you again later . "
131210	131213	131207	131207	her	3681	" now . "
131666	131675	131661	131661	He	317	" Mrs. Wilcox , I have done wrong , "
131759	131782	131750	131756	a man whom he had never seen	3715	" Oh , is he there ? I am not surprised . I now thrash him within an inch of his life . "
131783	131787	131789	131789	Leonard	317	" Mrs. Wilcox , "
131791	131797	131789	131789	Leonard	317	" I have done wrong . "
131808	131814	131798	131799	The man	807	" Bring me a stick . "
131853	131858	131860	131868	Charles , who had all through kept very calm	3718	" Get some water , "
131870	131892	131860	131868	Charles , who had all through kept very calm	3718	" He 's shamming . Of course I only used the blade . Here , carry him out into the air . "
131922	131927	131929	131929	Charles	528	" That 's enough , "
131931	131938	131940	131941	Miss Avery	469	" Yes , murder 's enough , "
132002	132013	132015	132015	Charles	528	" I do n't know where she is , pater , "
132017	132028	132015	132015	Charles	528	" Dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her . "
132029	132038	132052	132052	his	317	" Tell me when she comes in - . "
132068	132099	132015	132015	Charles	528	" I 'll sit up for her as late as you like , but she can hardly be coming . Is n't she stopping with her sister at the hotel ? "
132100	132103	132105	132106	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Perhaps , "
132109	132112	132105	132106	Mr. Wilcox	261	" perhaps . "
132113	132123	132015	132015	Charles	528	" Can I do anything for you , sir ? "
132124	132131	132105	132106	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Not tonight , my boy . "
132192	132198	132199	132199	he	261	" I ca n't sleep , "
132202	132216	132199	132199	he	261	" I had better have a talk with you and get it over . "
132266	132275	132277	132278	Mr. Wilcox	261	" She will feel differently in the morning , "
132290	132360	132361	132361	He	261	" But I can not let this kind of thing continue without comment . I am morally certain that she is with her sister at Howards End . The house is mine - and , Charles , it will be yours - and when I say that no one is to live there , I mean that no one is to live there . I wo n't have it . "
132368	132387	132361	132361	He	261	" To my mind this question is connected with something far greater , the rights of property itself . "
132388	132391	132393	132393	Charles	261	" Undoubtedly , "
132416	132485	132411	132411	he	261	" I do n't want you to conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a quarrel . She was only over - wrought , as who would not be ? I shall do what I can for Helen , but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once . Do you see ? That is a sine qua non . "
132486	132499	132548	132548	he	261	" Then at eight tomorrow I may go up in the car ? "
132500	132525	132411	132411	he	261	" Eight or earlier . Say that you are acting as my representative , and , of course , use no violence , Charles . "
132620	132627	132629	132629	Charles	261	" It has been pretty horrible , "
132632	132648	132629	132629	Charles	261	" They were there , and they had the man up there with them too . "
132649	132655	132591	132592	the police	4384	" What - what man ? "
132656	132668	132629	132629	Charles	261	" I told you last night . His name was Bast . "
132669	132677	132679	132680	Mr. Wilcox	261	" My God , is it possible ? "
132682	132697	132679	132680	Mr. Wilcox	261	" In your mother 's house ! Charles , in your mother 's house ! "
132698	132762	132629	132629	Charles	261	" I know , pater . That was what I felt . As a matter of fact , there is no need to trouble about the man . He was in the last stages of heart disease , and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went off . The police are seeing about it at this moment . "
132768	132852	132629	132629	Charles	261	" I got up there - oh , it could n't have been more than half - past seven . The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them . They were still upstairs . I waited in the drawing - room . We were all moderately civil and collected , though I had my suspicions . I gave them your message , and Mrs. Wilcox said , ' Oh yes , I see ; yes , ' in that way of hers . "
132853	132857	132629	132629	Charles	261	" Nothing else ? "
132858	132891	132629	132629	Charles	261	" I promised to tell you , ' with her love , ' that she was going to Germany with her sister this evening . That was all we had time for . "
132897	132948	132892	132893	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding , for suddenly Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his name . I recognized it , and I went for him in the hall . Was I right , pater ? I thought things were going a little too far . "
132949	132988	132989	132989	He	261	" Right , my dear boy ? I do n't know . But you would have been no son of mine if you had n't . Then did he just - just - crumple up as you said ? "
132996	133042	132892	132893	Mr. Wilcox	261	" He caught hold of the bookcase , which came down over him . So I merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden . We all thought he was shamming . However , he 's dead right enough . Awful business ! "
133043	133046	133054	133054	his	4006	" Sword ? "
133057	133064	133054	133054	his	4006	" What sword ? Whose sword ? "
133065	133071	132892	132893	Mr. Wilcox	261	" A sword of theirs . "
133072	133080	133054	133054	his	4006	" What were you doing with it ? "
133081	133128	132892	132893	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Well , did n't you see , pater , I had to snatch up the first thing handy I had n't a riding - whip or stick . I caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old German sword . "
133129	133133	133054	133054	his	4006	" Then what ? "
133134	133148	133150	133150	Charles	528	" He pulled over the bookcase , as I said , and fell , "
133172	133187	133054	133054	his	4006	" But the real cause was heart disease ? Of that you 're sure ? "
133188	133210	133163	133163	his	261	" That or a fit . However , we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics . "
133331	133344	133346	133347	his father	4006	" I think I 'll go round to the police - station , "
133353	133357	133359	133359	Dolly	348	" What for ? "
133366	133369	133359	133359	Dolly	348	" told . "
133370	133382	133346	133347	his father	4006	" Very well , sir . Which car will you have ? "
133383	133390	133359	133359	Dolly	348	" I think I 'll walk . "
133391	133400	133402	133402	Charles	528	" It 's a good half - mile , "
133409	133437	133402	133402	Charles	528	" The sun 's very hot for April . Sha n't I take you up , and then , perhaps , a little spin round by Tewin ? "
133438	133452	133454	133455	Mr. Wilcox	261	" You go on as if I did n't know my own mind , "
133463	133493	133458	133458	Charles	261	" You young fellows ' one idea is to get into a motor . I tell you , I want to walk : I 'm very fond of walking . "
133494	133529	133460	133460	his	261	" Oh , all right ; I 'm about the house if you want me for anything . I thought of not going up to the office today , if that is your wish . "
133530	133539	133541	133542	Mr. Wilcox	261	" It is , indeed , my boy , "
133683	133685	133690	133690	He	261	" I "
133763	133768	133770	133770	Charles	261	" I expected that , "
133772	133783	133770	133770	Charles	261	" I shall naturally be the most important witness there . "
134100	134112	134091	134092	Miss Avery	469	" No one ever told the lad he 'll have a child "
134424	134434	134435	134435	she	3772	" No doubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death , "
134438	134457	134435	134435	she	3772	" but if it was n't one thing it would have been another , as you yourselves know . "
134570	134574	134575	134576	the Schlegels	270	" Nothing matters , "
134583	134597	134575	134576	the Schlegels	270	" except one 's self - respect and that of one 's friends . "
135229	135239	135240	135240	she	278	" Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants ? "
135243	135251	135196	135196	He	360	" He did n't say , madam . "
135252	135261	135300	135300	She	479	" You have n't any note for me ? "
135262	135270	135196	135196	He	360	" He did n't say , madam . "
135394	135404	135390	135390	he	360	" I prefer to discuss things with you outside . "
135405	135419	135421	135421	Margaret	278	" It will be more appropriate in the road , I am afraid , "
135423	135430	135421	135421	Margaret	278	" Did you get my message ? "
135431	135435	135390	135390	he	360	" What about ? "
135436	135483	135421	135421	Margaret	278	" I am going to Germany with my sister . I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent home . Our talk last night was more important than you have realized . I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you . "
135484	135490	135492	135492	Henry	360	" I am extremely tired , "
135498	135514	135492	135492	Henry	360	" I have been walking about all the morning , and wish to sit down . "
135515	135528	135421	135421	Margaret	278	" Certainly , if you will consent to sit on the grass . "
135585	135591	135593	135593	Margaret	278	" Here are your keys , "
135618	135626	135627	135627	he	360	" I have something to tell you , "
135654	135663	135664	135664	she	3818	" I do n't want to hear it , "
135667	135701	135664	135664	she	3818	" My sister is going to be ill . My life is going to be with her now . We must manage to build up something , she and I and her child . "
135702	135708	135627	135627	he	360	" Where are you going ? "
135709	135725	135664	135664	she	3818	" Munich . We start after the inquest , if she is not too ill . "
135726	135731	135627	135627	he	360	" After the inquest ? "
135732	135735	135664	135664	she	3818	" Yes . "
135736	135749	135627	135627	he	360	" Have you realized what the verdict at the inquest will be ? "
135750	135756	135664	135664	she	3818	" Yes , heart disease . "
135757	135765	135627	135627	he	360	" No , my dear ; manslaughter . "
135785	135788	135790	135791	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Manslaughter , "
135793	135826	135790	135791	Mr. Wilcox	261	" Charles may go to prison . I dare not tell him . I do n't know what to do - what to do . I 'm broken - I 'm ended . "
136004	136011	136012	136012	she	479	" I have n't any idea , "
136015	136024	136012	136012	she	479	" Do you suppose baby may , Meg ? "
136035	136040	136041	136041	she	278	" What was that ? "
136044	136059	136012	136012	she	479	" Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay ? "
136060	136068	136070	136070	Margaret	278	" I have n't the least notion , "
136079	136144	136012	136012	she	479	" Now , Tom , baby is not to stand ; he is not to lie on his face ; he is not to lie so that his head wags ; he is not to be teased or tickled ; and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter . Will you be as careful as all that ? "
136151	136159	136161	136161	Margaret	278	" That child is a wonderful nursemaid , "
136163	136177	136179	136179	Helen	479	" He is fond of baby . That 's why he does it ! "
136191	136191	136183	136183	They	3834	"
136192	136202	136161	136161	Margaret	278	" Starting at the ages of six and one ? "
136203	136216	136183	136183	They	3834	" Of course . It will be a great thing for Tom . "
136217	136227	136161	136161	Margaret	278	" It may be a greater thing for baby . "
136376	136384	136386	136386	Helen	479	" What a time they all are ! "
136388	136396	136386	136386	Helen	479	" What can they be doing inside ? "
136440	136450	136452	136452	Helen	479	" I wish Henry was out to enjoy this , "
136454	136472	136452	136452	Helen	479	" This lovely weather and to be shut up in the house ! It 's very hard . "
136473	136479	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" It has to be , "
136483	136503	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" The hay - fever is his chief objection against living here , but he thinks it worth while . "
136504	136520	136452	136452	Helen	479	" Meg , is or is n't he ill ? I ca n't make out . "
136521	136554	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" Not ill . Eternally tired . He has worked very hard all his life , and noticed nothing . Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing . "
136555	136568	136452	136452	Helen	479	" I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle . "
136569	136600	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" Dreadfully . That is why I wish Dolly had not come , too , today . Still , he wanted them all to come . It has to be . "
136601	136608	136452	136452	Helen	479	" Why does he want them ? "
136614	136627	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" Meg , may I tell you something ? I like Henry . "
136628	136638	136640	136640	Margaret	278	" You 'd be odd if you did n't , "
136642	136647	136481	136481	Margaret	278	" I usen't to . "
136648	136651	136652	136652	She	278	" Usen't ! "
136719	136728	136758	136758	she	479	" I like Henry because he does worry . "
136729	136739	136758	136758	she	479	" And he likes you because you do n't . "
136761	136765	136758	136758	she	479	" Above love , "
136779	136922	136758	136758	she	479	" I mean a woman 's love for a man . I supposed I should hang my life on to that once , and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me . But everything is peaceful now ; I seem cured . That Herr Forstmeister , whom Frieda keeps writing about , must be a noble character , but he does n't see that I shall never marry him or anyone . It is n't shame or mistrust of myself . I simply could n't . I 'm ended . I used to be so dreamy about a man 's love as a girl , and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing . But it has n't been ; it has been itself a dream . Do you agree ? "
136923	136933	136758	136758	she	479	" I do not agree . I do not . "
136934	136944	136946	136946	Helen	479	" I ought to remember Leonard as my lover , "
136954	137006	136946	136946	Helen	479	" I tempted him , and killed him and it is surely the least I can do . I would like to throw out all my heart to Leonard on such an afternoon as this . But I can not . It is no good pretending . I am forgetting him . "
137013	137028	137029	137029	She	479	" How nothing seems to match - how , my darling , my precious - "
137033	137036	137029	137029	She	479	" Tommy ! "
137037	137042	137098	137098	Margaret	278	" Yes , please ? "
137043	137097	137029	137029	She	479	" Baby 's not to try and stand . - There 's something wanting in me . I see you loving Henry , and understanding him better daily , and I know that death would n't part you in the least . But I - Is it some awful appalling , criminal defect ? "
137105	137317	137102	137102	She	278	" It is only that people are far more different than is pretended . All over the world men and women are worrying because they can not develop as they are supposed to develop . Here and there they have the matter out , and it comforts them . Do n't fret yourself , Helen . Develop what you have ; love your child . I do not love children . I am thankful to have none . I can play with their beauty and charm , but that is all - nothing real , not one scrap of what there ought to be . And others - others go farther still , and move outside humanity altogether . A place , as well as a person , may catch the glow . Do n't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end ? It is part of the battle against sameness . Differences - eternal differences , planted by God in a single family , so that there may always be colour ; sorrow perhaps , but colour in the daily grey . Then I ca n't have you worrying about Leonard . Do n't drag in the personal when it will not come . Forget him . "
137318	137332	137102	137102	She	278	" Yes , yes , but what has Leonard got out of life ? "
137333	137338	137102	137102	She	278	" Perhaps an adventure . "
137339	137344	137102	137102	She	278	" Is that enough ? "
137345	137354	137102	137102	She	278	" Not for us . But for him . "
137401	137407	137409	137409	Margaret	278	" Is it sweetening yet ? "
137411	137417	137102	137102	She	278	" No , only withered . "
137418	137424	137102	137102	She	278	" It will sweeten tomorrow . "
137428	137438	137439	137439	she	479	" Oh , Meg , you are a person , "
137442	137474	137439	137439	she	479	" Think of the racket and torture this time last year . But now I could n't stop unhappy if I tried . What a change - and all through you ! "
137475	137503	137102	137102	She	278	" Oh , we merely settled down . You and Henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive , all through the autumn and the winter . "
137504	137513	137439	137439	she	479	" Yes , but who settled us down ? "
137536	137539	137541	137541	Helen	479	" You ! "
137543	137666	137541	137541	Helen	479	" You did it all , sweetest , though you 're too stupid to see . Living here was your plan - I wanted you ; he wanted you ; and every one said it was impossible , but you knew . Just think of our lives without you , Meg - I and baby with Monica , revolting by theory , he handed about from Dolly to Evie . But you picked up the pieces , and made us a home . Ca n't it strike you - even for a moment - that your life has been heroic ? Ca n't you remember the two months after Charles 's arrest , when you began to act , and did all ? "
137667	137676	137678	137678	Margaret	278	" You were both ill at the time , "
137680	137744	137678	137678	Margaret	278	" I did the obvious things . I had two invalids to nurse . Here was a house , ready furnished and empty . It was obvious . I did n't know myself it would turn into a permanent home . No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle , but things that I ca n't phrase have helped me . "
137745	137753	137755	137755	Helen	479	" I hope it will be permanent , "
137763	137780	137678	137678	Margaret	278	" I think so . There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our own . "
137781	137790	137791	137791	She	479	" All the same , London 's creeping . "
137814	137825	137826	137826	she	479	" You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now , "
137829	137865	137826	137826	she	479	" I can see it from the Purbeck Downs . And London is only part of something else , I 'm afraid . Life 's going to be melted down , all over the world . "
137929	137946	137947	137947	she	479	" Because a thing is going strong now , it need not go strong for ever , "
137950	138025	137947	137947	she	479	" This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years . It may be followed by a civilization that wo n't be a movement , because it will rest on the earth . All the signs are against it now , but I ca n't help hoping , and very early in the morning in the garden I feel that our house is the future as well as the past . "
138059	138066	138056	138056	Margaret	278	" Oh , take care - ! "
138082	138094	138056	138056	Margaret	278	" The conclave 's breaking at last . I 'll go . "
138127	138135	138136	138136	he	3858	" My father has asked for you , "
138149	138156	138157	138157	he	3858	" We have been talking business , "
138160	138172	138157	138157	he	3858	" but I dare say you knew all about it beforehand . "
138173	138179	138185	138185	he	3858	" Yes , I did . "
138349	138358	138360	138360	Henry	360	" Is this going to suit every one ? "
138380	138400	138366	138366	He	360	" Because I do n't want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair . "
138401	138410	138412	138412	Paul	259	" It 's apparently got to suit us , "
138414	138439	138366	138366	He	360	" I beg your pardon , my boy . You have only to speak , and I will leave the house to you instead . "
138453	138486	138487	138487	he	259	" As I 've given up the outdoor life that suited me , and I have come home to look after the business , it 's no good my settling down here , "
138492	138507	138487	138487	he	259	" It 's not really the country , and it 's not the town . "
138508	138520	138366	138366	He	360	" Very well . Does my arrangement suit you , Evie ? "
138521	138527	138487	138487	he	259	" Of course , Father . "
138528	138534	138366	138366	He	360	" And you , Dolly ? "
138550	138554	138555	138555	she	348	" Perfectly splendidly , "
138558	138626	138555	138555	she	348	" I thought Charles wanted it for the boys , but last time I saw him he said no , because we can not possibly live in this part of England again . Charles says we ought to change our name , but I can not think what to , for Wilcox just suits Charles and me , and I ca n't think of any other name . "
138652	138663	138665	138665	Henry	360	" Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely , "
138667	138689	138665	138665	Henry	360	" And let every one understand that ; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise . "
138725	138736	138738	138738	Henry	360	" In consequence , I leave my wife no money , "
138740	138843	138738	138738	Henry	360	" That is her own wish . All that she would have had will be divided among you . I am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime , so that you may be independent of me . That is her wish , too . She also is giving away a great deal of money . She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years ; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her - to her nephew , down in the field . Is all that clear ? Does every one understand ? "
138875	138898	138872	138872	he	259	" Down in the field ? Oh , come ! I think we might have had the whole establishment , piccaninnies included . "
138903	138916	138899	138900	Mrs. Cahill	564	" Do n't , Paul . You promised you 'd take care . "
138938	138946	138947	138947	he	915	" Good - bye , old girl , "
138950	138958	138947	138947	he	915	" do n't you worry about me . "
138959	138966	138978	138978	she	564	" Good - bye , Dad . "
138985	139016	138978	138978	she	564	" Good - bye , Mr. Wilcox . It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox should have left Margaret Howards End , and yet she get it , after all . "
139026	139031	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye , "
139057	139062	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye . "
139063	139070	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye , Dolly . "
139071	139077	139032	139032	she	564	" So long , Father . "
139078	139092	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye , my boy ; always take care of yourself . "
139093	139101	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye , Mrs. Wilcox . "
139102	139106	139032	139032	she	564	" Good - bye .
139147	139167	139144	139144	she	565	" Could you tell me , Henry , what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End ? "
139172	139257	139169	139169	he	1223	" Yes , she did . But that is a very old story . When she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return , and , not being herself at the time , scribbled ' Howards End ' on a piece of paper . I went into it thoroughly , and , as it was clearly fanciful , I set it aside , little knowing what my Margaret would be to me in the future . "
139275	139285	139286	139286	he	1223	" I did n't do wrong , did I ? "
139292	139305	139329	139329	Helen	257	" You did n't , darling . Nothing has been done wrong . "
139312	139319	139321	139321	Henry	360	" Here they are at last ! "
139355	139361	139362	139362	Helen	257	" The field 's cut ! "
139366	139391	139362	139362	Helen	257	" the big meadow ! We 've seen to the very end , and it 'll be such a crop of hay as never ! "
