244	270	271	274	The cluster of children	264	" Gracious goodness , children , what is it ? Who 's that lying on the floor ? Harriet Smales ! What ever has happened ? "
450	482	483	483	Ida	101	" How did it happen ? Some of you run at once for a doctor Dr. Williams in Grove Road Oh , quick ! Ida Starr , how did it happen ? "
511	514	516	517	Miss Rutherford	98	" Ida ! "
540	558	521	521	her	98	" Speak , child ! Has some one gone for the doctor ? How was it done ? "
618	637	663	663	She	98	" I did it , Miss Rutherford . I have killed Harriet . I , and nobody else . "
638	645	663	663	She	98	" You ? How , child ? "
646	662	663	663	She	98	" I killed her with the slate , Miss Rutherford ; this slate , look . "
844	922	816	817	Miss Rutherford	98	" I am going to take Harriet home . Lucy Wood , you will please to see that order is preserved in my absence ; I shall only be away twenty minutes , at the most . Ida Starr , you will go up into my sitting - room , and remain there till I come to you . All take out your copy - books ; I shall examine the lines written whilst I am away . "
1278	1373	1259	1259	her	98	" I wish to know who can give me any account of the way in which Harriet Smales received her hurt . Stop ! Hands only , please . And only those raise their hands who actually saw the blow struck , and overheard all that led to it . You understand , now ? One , two , three seven altogether , that is quite enough . Those seven will wait in the room at four o'clock till the others have all gone . Now I will give the first class their sums . "
1463	1467	1468	1469	Miss Rutherford	98	" Lucy Wood , "
1480	1497	1468	1469	Miss Rutherford	98	" you are the eldest . Please tell me all you can of this sad affair . "
1573	1584	1554	1555	this other	317	" Oh , Miss Rutherford , is Harriet really dead ? "
1585	1590	1592	1593	the lady	262	" Hush , hush ! "
1600	1612	1592	1593	the lady	262	" No , my dear , she is only badly hurt . "
1613	1621	1623	1624	the child	320	" And she really wo n't die ? "
1633	1651	1623	1624	the child	320	" Certainly not , certainly not . Now be quiet , Maud , and let Lucy begin . "
1708	1713	1704	1704	Lucy	102	" beyond all bearing . "
1855	1862	1852	1852	she	99	" call Ida 's mother names , "
1898	1907	1909	1910	Miss Rutherford	98	" What did she call Ida 's mother ? "
1920	1928	1916	1916	her	98	" She called her a bad woman . "
1929	1934	1909	1910	Miss Rutherford	98	" Was that all ? "
1935	1943	1946	1946	Maud	103	" No , please , Miss Rutherford , "
1949	1982	1946	1946	Maud	103	" She said she got her living in the streets . And it is n't true . Ida 's mother 's a lady , and does n't sell things in the streets ! "
1991	2003	2004	2004	she	325	" I do n't think I need ask any more questions , "
2008	2023	2004	2004	she	325	" Run away home all of you . What is it , my dear ? "
2052	2061	2062	2062	she	103	" May I wait for Ida , please , "
2065	2079	2062	2062	she	103	" and and walk home with her ? We go the same way . "
2080	2120	2155	2156	Miss Rutherford	98	" Not to - night , dear ; no , not to - night . Ida Starr is in disgrace . She will not go home just yet . Run away , now , there 's a good girl . "
2178	2185	2187	2188	the teacher	325	" Why do you stand so ? "
2196	2208	2187	2188	the teacher	325	" I thought you 'd want me to , Miss Rutherford . "
2209	2217	2187	2188	the teacher	325	" Come here to me , child . "
2344	2352	2354	2355	Miss Rutherford	98	" You will be glad to hear , "
2357	2384	2354	2355	Miss Rutherford	98	" that Harriet 's hurt is not as serious as we feared at first . But she will have to stay at home for some days . "
2393	2433	2459	2460	the schoolmistress	277	" Do you know that I am quite afraid of you , Ida ? I had no idea that you were so passionate . Had you no thought what harm you might do when you struck that terrible blow ? "
2449	2456	2459	2460	the schoolmistress	277	" You must go home now , "
2465	2505	2459	2460	the schoolmistress	277	" and not come back till I send for you . Tell your mother just what you have done , and say that I will write to her about you . You understand what I say , my child ? "
2750	2774	2746	2746	his	346	" She 's better , I thank you , madam ; much better , I hope and believe ; yes , much better . "
2804	2814	2782	2782	his	346	" Might I see her for a few moments ? "
2815	2908	2909	2909	He	348	" She would be happy , madam , very happy : oh yes , I am sure , very happy If if you would have the kindness to come round , yes , round here , madam , and and to excuse our poor sitting - room . Thank you , thank you . Harriet , my dear , Miss Rutherford has had the great , the very great , goodness to visit you to visit you personally yes . I will leave you , if if you please h'm , yes . "
3125	3184	3112	3113	the teacher	325	" I have no intention of blaming you , Harriet ; I should not speak of this at all , if it were not necessary . But I must ask you plainly what reason you had for speaking of Ida Starr 's mother as they say you did . Why did you say she was a bad woman ? "
3185	3193	3195	3195	Harriet	99	" It 's only what she is , "
3204	3220	3195	3195	Harriet	99	" What do you mean by that ? Who has told you anything about her ? "
3251	3259	3261	3262	Miss Rutherford	98	" What does Sarah say , then ? "
3264	3290	3292	3293	the girl	316	" She says she is n't respectable , and that she goes about with men , and she 's only a common street - woman , "
3326	3340	3341	3341	she	277	" Well , that 's all I wanted to ask you , Harriet , "
3344	3434	3341	3341	she	277	" I wo n't blame you , but I trust you will do as I wish , and never say such things about any one again , whoever may tell you . It is our duty never to speak ill of others , you know ; least of all when we know that to do so will be the cause of much pain and trouble . I hope you will very soon be able to come back again to us . And now I will say good - bye . "
3453	3467	3468	3468	she	98	" Of course I can not risk the recurrence of such a thing , "
3471	3486	3468	3468	she	98	" The child who did it will not return to me , Mr. Smales . "
4015	4021	3993	3993	Her	101	" Mrs. Ledward , Dressmaker ; "
4036	4038	3993	3993	Her	101	" Apartments "
4282	4292	4293	4293	she	108	" How 's ' t you 're so late ? "
4331	4337	4302	4302	her	377	" Your mother 's poorly . "
4338	4351	4353	4353	Ida	101	" Oh , then I shall sleep with her to - night ? "
4366	4369	4371	4372	Mrs. Ledward	108	" Dessay , "
4516	4522	4523	4523	she	377	" Where have you been ? "
4540	4547	4523	4523	she	377	" Why are you so late ? "
4573	4609	4610	4610	she	377	" No , no ; do n't kiss me . Ca n't you see what a sore throat I 've got ? You might catch it . And I have n't got you any tea , "
4627	4666	4622	4622	she	377	" Ai n't I a naughty mother ? But it serves you half right for being late . Come and kiss me ; I do n't think it 's catching . No , perhaps you 'd better not . "
4681	4685	4622	4622	she	377	" There now , "
4693	4749	4622	4622	she	377	" I should n't wonder if you catch it , and we shall both be laid up at once . Oh , Ida , I do feel that poorly , I do ! It 's the draught under the door ; what else can it be ? I do , I do feel that poorly ! "
4791	4820	4774	4774	She	101	" Oh , how hot you are , mother ! Shall I get you a cup of tea , dear ? Would n't it make your throat better ? "
4821	4871	4774	4774	She	101	" Perhaps it would ; I do n't know . Do n't go away , not just yet . You 'll have to be a mother to me to - night , Ida . I almost feel I could go to sleep , if you held me like that . "
4888	4902	4872	4872	She	101	" What am I thinking about ! Of course you want your tea . "
4903	4915	4774	4774	She	101	" No , no ; indeed I do n't , mother . "
4916	5006	4872	4872	She	101	" Nonsense ; of course you do . See , the kettle is on the bob , and I think it 's full . Go away ; you make me hotter . Let me see you get your tea , and then perhaps it 'll make me feel I could drink a cup . There , you 've put your hair all out of order ; let me smooth it . Do n't trouble to lay the cloth ; just use the tray ; it 's in the cupboard . "
5518	5530	5531	5531	she	101	" Do you like me to be with you , mother ? "
5547	5555	5531	5531	she	101	" Does it make you feel better ? "
5556	5619	5531	5531	she	101	" Yes , yes . But it 's my throat , and you ca n't make that better ; I only wish you could . But you are a comfort to me , for all that ; I do n't know what I should do without you . Oh , I sha'n't be able to speak a word soon , I sha'n't ! "
5620	5725	5531	5531	she	101	" Do n't , do n't talk , dear . I 'll talk instead , and you listen . Do n't you think , mother dear , I could could always sleep with you ? I would n't disturb you ; indeed , indeed I would n't ! You do n't know how quiet I lie . If I 'm wakeful ever I seem to have such a lot to think about , and I lie so still and quiet , you ca n't think . I never wake Mrs. Led ward , indeed . Do let me , mother ; just try me ! "
5792	5878	5947	5948	the mother	403	" I 've often told you , you ca n't , you must n't bother me . There , there ; you do n't mean any harm , but you put me out , bothering me , Ida . Tell me , what do you think about when you lay awake ? Do n't you think you 'd give anything to get off to sleep again ? I know I do ; I ca n't bear to think ; it makes my head ache so . "
5879	5934	5947	5948	the mother	403	" Oh , I like it . Sometimes I think over what I 've been reading , in the animal book , and the geography - book ; and and then I begin my wishing - thoughts . And oh , I 've such lots of wishing - thoughts , you could n't believe ! "
5935	5945	5947	5948	the mother	403	" And what are the wishing - thoughts about ? "
5959	6022	5947	5948	the mother	403	" I often wish I was grown up . I feel tired of being a child ; I want to be a woman . Then I should know so much more , and I should be able to understand all the things you tell me I ca n't now . I do n't care for playing at games and going to school . "
6023	6034	6036	6036	Lotty	110	" You 'll be a woman soon enough , Ida , "
6046	6054	6036	6036	Lotty	110	" But go on ; what else ? "
6055	6099	5947	5948	the mother	403	" And then I often wish I was a boy . It must be so much nicer to be a boy . They 're stronger than girls , and they know more . Do n't you wish I was a boy , mother ? "
6100	6110	6112	6112	Lotty	110	" Yes , I do , I often do ! "
6114	6132	6112	6112	Lotty	110	" Boys are n't such a trouble , and they can go out and shift for themselves . "
6133	6146	6148	6148	Ida	101	" Oh , but I wo n't be a trouble to you , "
6150	6159	6148	6148	Ida	101	" When I 'm old enough to leave school "
6197	6209	6210	6210	Lotty	110	" Ida , have I been a bad mother to you ? "
6215	6227	6210	6210	Lotty	110	" If I was to die , would you be sorry ? "
6228	6231	6180	6181	her mother	377	" Mother ! "
6232	6332	6210	6210	Lotty	110	" I 've done my best , indeed I 've done my best for yon ! How many mothers like me would have brought you up as I 've done ? How many , I 'd like to know ? And some day you 'll hate me ; oh yes , you will ! Some day you 'll wish to forget all about me , and you 'll never come to see where I 'm buried , and you 'll get rid of everything that could remind you of me . How I wish I 'd never been born ! "
6635	6644	6646	6646	Ida	101	" It 's from Miss Rutherford , mother , "
6657	6663	6665	6665	Lotty	110	" Oh , is it ? "
6677	6695	6674	6674	she	110	" I suppose she wants to know why you did n't go . Read it to me . "
6714	6779	6788	6788	her	101	" DEAR MRS . STARR , I am very sorry to have to say that Ida must not return to school . I had better leave the explanation to herself ; she is truthful , and will tell you what has compelled me to take this step . I grieve to lose her , but have really no choice . I am , yours truly ,
6783	6783	6780	6781	H. RUTHERFORD	112	"
6819	6840	6788	6788	her	101	" What have you done , child ? what ever have you done ? Is is it anything about me . "
6841	6866	6803	6803	she	101	" I hit Harriet Smales with a slate , and covered her all over with blood , and I thought I 'd killed her . "
6889	6896	6898	6898	Lotty	110	" What made you do it ? "
6902	6920	6871	6872	her mother	377	" I could n't help it , mother ; she she said you were a bad woman . "
7123	7130	7132	7133	the woman	448	" Ai n't you better then ? "
7153	7159	7161	7162	the other	449	" I 'm very bad , "
7172	7234	7362	7363	the woman	448	" Ay , you 've got a bad cold , that 's what it is . I 'll make you some gruel presently , and put some rum in it . You do n't take care of yourself : I told you how it ' ud be when you came in with those wringin ' things on , on Thursday night . "
7235	7246	7248	7248	Lotty	110	" They 've found out about me at the school , "
7255	7263	7248	7248	Lotty	110	" and Ida 's got sent away . "
7264	7306	7362	7363	the woman	448	" She has ? Well , never mind , you can find another , I suppose . I ca n't see myself what she wants with so much schoolin ' , but I suppose you know best about your own affairs . "
7307	7356	7248	7248	Lotty	110	" Oh , I feel that bad ! If I get over this , I 'll give it up God help me , I will ! I 'll get my living honest , if there 's any way . I never felt so bad as I do now . "
7357	7360	7362	7363	the woman	448	" Pooh ! "
7365	7407	7362	7363	the woman	448	" Wait a bit till you get rid of your sore throat , and you 'll think different . Poorly people gets all sorts o ' fancies . Keep a bit quiet now , and do n't put yourself out so . "
7408	7422	7248	7248	Lotty	110	" What are we to do ? I 've only got a few shillings "
7423	7463	7362	7363	the woman	448	" Well , you 'll have money again some time , I suppose . You do n't suppose I 'll turn you out in the streets ? Write to Fred on Monday , and he 'll send you something . "
7574	7577	7579	7581	the sick woman	455	" Ida , "
7587	7616	7584	7584	herself	455	" get me some note - paper and an envelope out of the box ; and go and borrow pen and ink , there 's a good child . "
7665	7671	7672	7672	she	377	" The bells have stopped , "
7677	7692	7672	7672	she	377	" It 's half - past eleven . Put on your things , Ida . "
7699	7734	7693	7694	The child	320	" Give me my purse out of the drawer . See , there 's a shilling . Now , say this after me : Mr. Abra'm Woodstock , Number , St. John Street Road . "
7740	7863	7735	7735	Ida	101	" Now , listen , Ida . You put this letter in your pocket ; you go down into the Mary'bone road ; you ask for a ' bus to the Angel . When you get to the Angel , you ask your way to Number , St. John Street Road ; it is n't far off . Knock at the door , and ask if Mr. Abra'm Woodstock is in . If he is , say you want to see him , and then give him this letter , into his own hands , and nobody else 's . If he is n't in , ask when he will be , and , if it wo n't be long , wait . "
7902	7910	7912	7912	Lotty	110	" Well , ai n't you gone ? "
7915	7921	7922	7922	They	458	" Kiss me , mother . "
8131	8377	8124	8124	Ida	101	" Well , Mr. What's - your - name , I suppose I know my own business rather better than you can teach me . It 's pretty clear you 've been doing your best for some time to set the people against me , and I 'm damned if I 'll have it ! You go to the place on religious pretences , and what your real object may be I do n't know ; but I do know one thing , and that is , I wo n't have you hanging about any longer . I 'll meet you there myself , and if it 's a third - floor window you get pitched out of , well , it wo n't be my fault . Now I do n't want any more talk with you . This is most folks ' praying - time ; I wonder you 're not at it . It 's my time for writing letters , and I 'd rather have your room than your company . I 'm a plain - spoken man , you see , a man of business , and I do n't mince matters . To come and dictate to me about the state of my houses and of my tenants ai n't a business - like proceeding , and you 'll excuse me if I do n't take it kindly . There 's the door , and good morning to you ! "
8435	8440	8441	8441	he	473	" Eh ? Well ? "
8455	8467	8441	8441	he	473	" I have a letter for Mr. Abra'm Woodstock , sir . "
8468	8480	8441	8441	he	473	" Well , give it here . Who 's it from ? "
8481	8487	8441	8441	he	473	" Mrs. Starr , sir . "
8488	8501	8441	8441	he	473	" Who 's Mrs. Starr ? Come in here , will you ? "
8733	8737	8738	8738	he	473	" Sit down , "
8799	8805	8806	8806	he	473	" What 's your name ? "
8840	8848	8855	8855	He	473	" Ida , sir , Ida Starr . "
8849	8854	8855	8855	He	473	" Starr , eh ? "
8883	8905	8855	8855	He	473	" Well , Ida Starr , it seems your mother wants to put you in the way of earning your living . "
8915	8960	8906	8907	The child	320	" You can carry a message ? You 'll say to your mother that I 'll undertake to do what I can for you , on one condition , and that is that she puts you in my hands and never sees you again . "
8961	8970	8979	8979	her	320	" Oh , I ca n't leave mother ! "
8988	8998	9000	9001	Mr. Woodstock	114	" I did n't ask you if you could , "
9020	9036	9016	9016	his	114	" I asked whether you could carry a message . Can you , or not ? "
9037	9043	9045	9045	Ida	101	" Yes , I can , "
9047	9069	9070	9070	He	114	" Then take that message , and tell your mother it 's all I 've got to say . Run away . "
10070	10079	10080	10080	she	316	" Then I shall go on the streets ! "
10084	10093	10080	10080	she	316	" There 's nothing else left for me . "

10643	10779	10637	10637	friends	562	" the landlady will understand quite well what is meant , and will either accept or refuse her for a lodger as she sees good . To such houses as these Lotty confined herself . After some three or four years of various experiences , she hit upon the abode in Milton Street , and there had dwelt ever since . She got on well with Mrs. Ledward , and had been able to make comfortable arrangements for Ida . The other lodgers in the house were generally very quiet and orderly people , and she herself was quite successful in arranging her affairs so as to create no disturbance . She had her regular clientele ; she frequented the roads about Regent 's Park and Primrose Hill ; and she supported herself and her child .

12604	12626	12598	12598	Lotty	110	" Come here , and tell me . Did you see see him , Ida ? Mr. Woodstock , you know . "
12627	12632	12634	12635	the child	320	" Yes , mother , "
12641	12651	12634	12635	the child	320	" and he he said I was to tell you "
12665	12688	12711	12711	She	110	" Oh , you wo n't send me away from you , mother dear ? I ca n't go away from you ! "
12730	12738	12739	12739	she	110	" Tell me , ca n't you ? "
12747	12766	12739	12739	she	110	" What did he say ? Do n't be a little fool ! Ca n't the child speak ? "
12800	12805	12806	12806	Ida	101	" The gentleman said , "
12821	12838	12806	12806	Ida	101	" that he would take me ; but that you were never to see me again . "
12839	12848	12850	12850	Lotty	110	" Did he say anything else about me ? "
12852	12858	12806	12806	Ida	101	" No , nothing else . "
12859	12874	12806	12806	Ida	101	" Go go and tell him you 'll come , you 'll leave me . "
13010	13022	13024	13025	Mrs. Ledward	108	" We 're going to take your mother to the hospital , "
13030	13066	13024	13025	Mrs. Ledward	108	" You wait here till we come back , there 's a good girl . Now , hold up a bit , Lotty ; try and walk downstairs . That 's better , my girl . "
13288	13343	13284	13286	little Maud Enderby	103	" Where have you been , Ida ? Where are you going ? Oh , I 'm so glad ; I wanted so to see you . Miss Rutherford told us you 'd left school , and you were n't coming back again . Are n't you really ? And sha'n't I see you ? "
13344	13354	13356	13356	Ida	101	" I do n't know , I think not , "
13371	13382	13385	13385	Maud	103	" I told Miss Rutherford you were n't to blame , "
13388	13423	13385	13385	Maud	103	" I told her it was Harriet 's own fault , and how shockingly she 'd behaved to you . I expect you 'll come back again after the holidays , do n't you ? "
13433	13441	13443	13445	the little maid	670	" But I shall see you again ? "
13447	13476	13443	13445	the little maid	670	" You know we 're always going to be friends , are n't we ? Who shall I tell all my dreams to , if I lose you ? "
14444	14458	14459	14459	he	693	" And I was born in Rome , was n't I , uncle ? "
14464	14473	14459	14459	he	693	" I am a Roman ; Romanus sum ! "
14509	14519	14520	14520	he	693	" Some day I will go to Rome again , "
14523	14553	14520	14520	he	693	" and both of you shall go with me . We shall see the Forum and the Capitol ! Sha'n't you shout when you see the Capitol , uncle ? "
14649	14665	14666	14666	he	106	" Put the book away , and draw up to the fire , my boy , "
14682	14696	14666	14666	he	106	" It 's Christmas time , and Christmas only comes once a year . "
14713	14718	14719	14719	he	106	" Well , Julian , "
14730	14745	14719	14719	he	106	" a year more school , I suppose , and then business ; what ? "
14746	14751	14697	14697	He	106	" Yes , uncle . "
14768	14862	14752	14753	The boy	693	" I wish I could afford to make you something better , my lad ; you ought to be something better by rights . And I do n't well know what you 'll find to do in this little shop . The business might be better ; yes , might be better . You wo n't have much practice in dispensing , I 'm afraid , unless things improve . It is mostly hair - oil , and the patent medicines . It 's a poor look - out for you , Julian . "
14868	14879	14880	14880	Smales	99	" Harriet is n't quite well yet , is she ? "
14888	14898	14880	14880	Smales	99	" No , she looked poorly to - night . "
14899	14902	14904	14905	the other	449	" Julian , "
14918	14923	14880	14880	Smales	99	" Yes , uncle ? "
14924	15033	14880	14880	Smales	99	" I wonder what ' ud become of her if I if I died now ? You 're growing up , and you 're a clever lad ; you 'll soon be able to shift for yourself . But what 'll Harriet do ? If only she had her health . And I shall have nothing to leave either her or you , Julian , nothing , nothing ! She 'll have to get her living somehow . I must think of some easy business for her , I must . She might be a teacher , but her head is n't strong enough , I fear . Julian "
15034	15039	14880	14880	Smales	99	" Yes , uncle ? "
15040	15053	15056	15057	his uncle	699	" You you are old enough to understand things , my boy , "
15063	15126	15056	15057	his uncle	699	" Suppose , after I 'm dead and gone , Harriet should want help . She wo n't make many friends , I fear , and she 'll have bad health . Suppose she was in want of any kind , you 'd stand by her , Julian , would n't you ? You 'd be a friend to her , always ? "
15127	15134	15136	15137	the boy	693	" Indeed I would , uncle ! "
15140	15156	15056	15057	his uncle	699	" You promise me that , Julian , this Christmas night ? you promise it ? "
15157	15186	15187	15187	His	693	" Yes , I promise , uncle . You 've always been kind and good to me , and see if I 'm not the same to Harriet . "
15194	15205	15207	15207	Smales	99	" No , I sha'n't see it , my boy , "
15214	15241	15210	15210	his	693	" but the promise will be a comfort to me at the end , a comfort to me . You 're a good lad , Julian ! "
15868	15907	15840	15841	Her aunt	737	" I wish to speak to you before you go upstairs , Maud ; to speak of things which you can not understand fully as yet , but which you are old enough to begin to think about . "
16006	16013	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" Do you wonder at all , "
16019	16043	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" why we never spend Christmas like your friends do in their homes , with eating and drinking and all sorts of merriment ? "
16044	16052	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" Yes , aunt , I do . "
16070	16080	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" You know what Christmas Day means , Maud ? "
16081	16092	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" It is the day on which Christ was born . "
16093	16107	16014	16015	Miss Bygrave	121	" And for what purpose did Christ come as a child on earth ? "
16160	16170	16138	16138	She	103	" He came to make us free from sin . "
16171	16211	16138	16138	She	103	" And so we should rejoice at His coming . But would it please Him , do you think , to see us showing our joy by indulging in those very sins from which He came to free us ? "
16218	16232	16212	16212	Maud	103	" Is it a sin to like cake and sweet things , aunt ? "
16250	16255	16256	16256	she	121	" Listen , Maud , "
16259	16407	16256	16256	she	121	" and I will tell you what I mean . For you to like such things is no sin , as long as you are still too young to have it explained to you why you should overcome that liking . As I said , you are now old enough to begin to think of more than a child 's foolishness , to ask yourself what is the meaning of the life which has been given you , what duties you must set before yourself as you grow up to be a woman . When once these duties have become clear to you , when you understand what the end of life is , and how you should seek to gain it , then many things become sinful which were not so before , and many duties must be performed which previously you were not ready for . "
16458	16468	16469	16469	she	121	" Keep in mind what I shall tell you , "
16475	16618	16469	16469	she	121	" and some day you will better understand its meaning than you can now . The sin which Christ came to free us from was fondness for the world , enjoyment of what we call pleasure , desire for happiness on earth . He Himself came to set us the example of one to whom the world was nothing , who could put aside every joy , and make His life a life of sorrows . Even that was not enough . When the time had come , and He had finished His teaching of the disciples whom He chose , He willingly underwent the most cruel of all deaths , to prove that His teaching had been the truth , and to show us that we must face any most dreadful suffering rather than desert what we believe to be right . "
16638	16642	16644	16645	Miss Bygrave	121	" And this , "
16647	16978	16644	16645	Miss Bygrave	121	" is why I think it wrong to make Christmas a time of merriment . In the true Christian , every enjoyment which comes from the body is a sin . If you feel you like this or that , it is a sign that you must renounce it , give it up . If you feel fond of life , you must force yourself to hate it ; for life is sin . Life is given to us that we may conquer ourselves . We are placed in the midst of sin that we may struggle against its temptations . There is temptation in the very breath you draw , since you feel a dread if it is checked . You must live so as to be ready at any moment to give up your life with gladness , as a burden which it has been appointed you to bear for a time . There is temptation in the love you feel for those around you ; it makes you cling to life ; you are tempted to grieve if you lose them , whereas death is the greatest blessing in the gift of God . And just because it is so , we must not snatch at it before our time ; it would be a sin to kill ourselves , since that would be to escape from the tasks set us . Many pleasures would seem to be innocent , but even these it is better to renounce , since for that purpose does every pleasure exist . I speak of the pleasures of the world . One joy there is which we may and must pursue , the joy of sacrifice . The more the body suffers , the greater should be the delight of the soul ; and the only moment of perfect happiness should be that when the world grows dark around us , and we feel the hand of death upon our hearts . "
17050	17067	17068	17068	Lotty	110	" Your daughter is dying , and wishes to see you . Please come at once . "
17560	17570	17571	17571	he	114	" A Mrs. Starr lived here , I believe ? "
17574	17597	17550	17550	He	114	" She does live here , sir , but she 's in the orspital at present , I 'm sorry to say . "
17598	17605	17550	17550	He	114	" Is her child at home ? "
17606	17612	17550	17550	He	114	" She is , sir . "
17613	17630	17550	17550	He	114	" Let me see her , will you ? In some room , if you please . "
17714	17722	17724	17725	Mr. Woodstock	114	" You remember coming to see me , "
17738	17743	17745	17745	Ida	101	" Yes , sir , "
17749	17763	17764	17764	His	114	" I have just been at the hospital . Your mother is dead . "
17937	17949	17950	17950	he	114	" You 'll be left all alone now , you see , "
17958	17988	17950	17950	he	114	" I was a friend of your mother 's , and I 'll do what I can for you . You 'd better come with me to my house . "
18000	18010	18011	18011	she	101	" If you were a friend of mother 's , "
18014	18033	18011	18011	she	101	" why did you want to take me away from her and never let her see me again ? "
18034	18045	18047	18047	Abraham	115	" Well , you 've nothing to do with that , "
18050	18063	18047	18047	Abraham	115	" Go and put your things on , and come with me . "
18064	18067	18069	18069	Ida	101	" No , "
18072	18082	18069	18069	Ida	101	" I do n't want to go with you . "
18083	18102	18047	18047	Abraham	115	" What you want has nothing to do with it . You will do as I tell you . "
18138	18145	18147	18148	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Why wo n't you come ? "
18151	18158	18160	18160	Ida	101	" I do n't want to , "
18164	18170	18172	18173	the other	449	" Look here , then , "
18180	18229	18172	18173	the other	449	" You have the choice , and you 're old enough to see what it means . You can either come with me and be well cared for , or stay here and shift as best you can ; now , be sharp and make up your mind . "
18230	18249	18255	18256	Mr. Woodstock	114	" I do n't wish to go with you , I 'll stay here and do my best . "
18250	18254	18172	18173	the other	449	" Very well . "
18552	18557	18558	18558	she	108	" You little idjot ! "
18561	18582	18558	18558	she	108	" What do you mean by refusing a offer like that ! Why , the gentleman 's your own father . "
18583	18587	18589	18589	Ida	101	" My father ! "
18595	18612	18589	18589	Ida	101	" My father died when I was a baby . Mother 's told me so often . "
18613	18652	18558	18558	she	108	" If you believe all your mother told you , Well , well , you have been a little wooden - head . What made you behave like that to him ? Where does he live , eh ? "
18653	18659	18589	18589	Ida	101	" I do n't know . "
18660	18730	18558	18558	she	108	" You do know . Why , I heard him say you 'd been to see him . And what are you going to do , I 'd like to know ? You do n't expect me to keep you , I s'pose . Tell me at once where the gentleman lives , and let me take you there . The idea of your turning against your own father ! "
18731	18738	18740	18740	Ida	101	" He 's not my father ! "
18743	18760	18740	18740	Ida	101	" My father is dead ; and now mother 's dead , and I 'm alone . "
18794	18870	18558	18558	she	108	" WANTED , human companionship . A young man of four - and - twenty wishes to find a congenial associate of about his own age . He is a student of ancient and modern literatures , a free - thinker in religion , a lover of art in all its forms , a hater of conventionalism . Would like to correspond in the first instance . Address O. W. , City News Rooms , W.C. "
19514	19517	19522	19522	himself	838	" O. W. "
20198	20205	20206	20206	he	130	" You smoke , I hope ? "
20225	20257	20218	20218	his	118	" No ? How on earth do you support existence ? At all events , you do n't , as the railway - carriage phrase has it , object to smoking ? "
20258	20276	20218	20218	his	118	" Not at all . I like the scent , but was never tempted to go further . "
20361	20373	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" That 's a point of contact , at all events , "
20377	20408	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" I detest the very name of Parliament , and could as soon read Todhunter on Conic Sections as the reports of a debate . Perhaps you 're a mathematician ? "
20414	20419	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" By no means , "
20424	20428	20429	20429	Casti	118	" In fact , "
20433	20505	20429	20429	Casti	118	" I 'm afraid you begin to think my interests are very narrow indeed . My opportunities have been small . I left a very ordinary school at fourteen , and what knowledge I have since got has come from my own efforts . I am sure the profit from our intercourse would be entirely on my side . I have the wish to go in for many things , however , "
20506	20509	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" Oh , "
20515	20774	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" do n't suppose that I am a scholar in any sense of the word , or a man of more than average culture . My own regular education came to an end pretty much at the same age , and only a certain stubbornness has forced me into an intellectual life , if you can call it so . Not much intellect required in my every - day business , at all events . The school in which I teach is a fair type of the middle - class commercial ' academy ; ' the headmaster a nincompoop and charlatan , my fellow - assistants poor creatures , who must live , I suppose , though one does n't well understand why . I had always a liking for Greek and Latin and can make shift to read both in a way satisfactory to myself , though I dare say it would n't go for much with college examiners . Then , as for my scribbling , well , it has scarcely yet passed the amateur stage . It will some day ; simply because I 've made up my mind that it shall ; but as yet I have n't got beyond a couple of weak articles in weak magazines , and I do n't exactly feel sure of my way . I rather think we shall approach most nearly in our taste for poetry . I liked much what you had to say about Keats . It decided me that we ought to go on . "
20783	20796	20798	20798	Waymark	130	" What did you think at first of my advertisement , eh ? "
20808	20816	20798	20798	Waymark	130	" Queer idea , was n't it ? "
20817	20838	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" It came upon me curiously . It was so like a frequent thought of my own actually carried out . "
20839	20854	20798	20798	Waymark	130	" It was ? You have felt that same desperate need of congenial society ? "
20855	20950	20375	20375	Waymark	130	" I have felt it very strongly indeed . I live so very much alone , and have always done so . Fortunately I am of a very cheerful disposition , or I might have suffered much . The young fellows I see every day have n't much intellect , it must be confessed . I used to try to get them under the influence of my own enthusiasms , but they did n't seem to understand me . They care only for things which either repel me , or are utterly without interest . "
20951	20960	20798	20798	Waymark	130	" Ha ! you understand what that means ! "
21001	21232	20986	20986	he	130	" You know what it is to have to do exclusively with fools and brutes , to rave under the vile restraints of Philistine surroundings ? Then you can form some notion of the state I was in when I took the step of writing that advertisement ; I was , I firmly believe , on the verge of lunacy ! For two or three days I had come back home from the school only to pace up and down the room in an indescribable condition . I get often like that , but this time things seemed reaching a head . Why , I positively cried with misery , absurd as it may sound . My blood seemed too hot , seemed to be swelling out the veins beyond endurance . As a rule I get over these moods by furious walking about the streets half through the night , but I could n't even do that . I had no money to go in for dissipation : that often helps me . Every book was loathsome to me . My landlady must have overheard something , for she came in and began a conversation about God knows what ; I fear I mortally offended her ; I could have pitched the poor old woman out of the window ! Heavens , how did I get through those nights ? "
21233	21240	21242	21242	Julian	118	" And the fit has passed ? "
21248	21256	21257	21257	Waymark	130	" The Lord be praised ; yes ! "
21263	21329	21257	21257	Waymark	130	" There came an editor 's note , accepting a thing that had been going from magazine to magazine for three months . This snatched me up into furious spirits . I rushed out to a theatre , drank more than was good for me , made a fool of myself in general , and then received your letter . Good luck never comes singly . "
21378	21384	21386	21387	the other	449	" Do I shock you ? "
21389	21407	21386	21387	the other	449	" Do you think me rather too much of an animal , for all my spiritual longings ? "
21408	21421	21363	21363	Casti	118	" Certainly not , I can well understand you , I believe . "
21521	21528	21530	21530	Waymark	130	" You have been in Italy ? "
21582	21585	21586	21586	he	118	" Not , "
21751	21751	21752	21752	Waymark	130	"
21762	21769	21770	21770	he	130	" Why , this is famous ! "
21773	21810	21770	21770	he	130	" We shall suit each other splendidly . Who knows ? We may see Italy together , and look back upon these times of miserable struggle . By the by , have you ever written verses ? "
21818	21824	21825	21825	he	118	" I have tried to , "
21828	21833	21752	21752	Waymark	130	" And do still ? "
21834	21837	21752	21752	Waymark	130	" Sometimes . "
21838	21965	21752	21752	Waymark	130	" I thought as much . Some day you shall let me hear them ; wo n't you ? And I will read you some of my own . But mine are in the savage vein , a mere railing against the universe , altogether too furious to be anything like poetry ; I know that well enough . I have long since made up my mind to stick to prose ; it is the true medium for a polemical egotist . I want to find some new form of satire ; I feel capabilities that way which shall by no means rust unused . It has pleased Heaven to give me a splenetic disposition , and some day or other I shall find the tongue . "
22052	22067	22069	22069	Julian	118	" It 's too bad to have brought you so far at this hour , "
22075	22085	22110	22110	He	130	" Oh , it is my hour for walking , "
22090	22109	22110	22110	He	130	" London streets at night are my element . Depend upon it , Rome was poor in comparison ! "
23094	23105	23107	23107	her	99	" I think I 'm going to leave my place , "
23150	23155	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" I hope not , "
23165	23170	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" What has happened ? "
23171	23224	23121	23121	She	99	" Oh , I do n't know ; it 's always the same ; people treat you as if you was so much dirt . I have n't been accustomed to it , and I do n't see why I should begin now . I can soon enough get a new shop . "
23225	23234	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" Has Mrs. Ogle been unkind to you ? "
23235	23271	23121	23121	She	99	" Oh , I do n't know , and I do n't much care . You 're expected to slave just the same , day after day , whether you 're feeling well or not . "
23295	23303	23304	23304	he	118	" Have n't you been feeling well ? "
23312	23339	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" Well , no , I have n't . My head fairly splits now , and this sun is n't likely to make it any better . "
23340	23349	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" Let us cross to the shady side . "
23350	23370	23157	23158	her cousin	911	" ' Twon't make any difference ; I ca n't run to get out of the way of horses . "
23378	23390	23391	23391	she	99	" Why did n't you write to me in the week ? "
23395	23421	23391	23391	she	99	" I 'm sure it would be a relief to hear from somebody sometimes . It 's like a year from one Sunday to another . "
23422	23456	23461	23461	his	118	" Did I promise to write ? I really did n't remember having done so ; I 'm very sorry . I might have told you about a new friend I 've got . "
23513	23520	23521	23522	the girl	316	" What sort of a friend ? "
23527	23545	23521	23522	the girl	316	" A very pleasant fellow , rather older than myself ; I made his acquaintance by chance . "
23565	23576	23577	23577	he	118	" We are going to see each other every Sunday , "
23581	23593	23546	23546	Julian	118	" Then I suppose you 'll give up coming for me ? "
23594	23616	23546	23546	Julian	118	" Oh no , not at all . I shall see him at night always , after I have left you . "
23617	23623	23546	23546	Julian	118	" Where does he live ? "
23624	23632	23546	23546	Julian	118	" Rather far off ; in Kennington . "
23633	23638	23546	23546	Julian	118	" What is he ? "
23639	23689	23546	23546	Julian	118	" A teacher in a school . I hope to get good from being with him ; we 're going to read together , and so on . I wish you could find some pleasant companion of the same kind , Harriet ; you would n't feel so lonely . "
23690	23739	23546	23546	Julian	118	" I dare say I 'm better off without anybody . I should n't suit them . It 's very few people I do suit , or else people do n't suit me , one or the other . What 's his name , your new friend 's ? "
23740	23743	23546	23546	Julian	118	" Waymark . "
23744	23753	23546	23546	Julian	118	" And he lives in Kennington ? Whereabouts ? "
23754	23771	23546	23546	Julian	118	" In Walcot Square . I do n't think you know that part , do you ? "
23772	23776	23546	23546	Julian	118	" What number ? "
23819	23831	23833	23833	her	920	" I suppose you 'll go out at nights with him ? "
23837	23849	23833	23833	her	920	" It is scarcely likely . Where should we go to ? "
23850	23870	23787	23787	her	920	" Oh , I do n't know , and I do n't suppose it matters much , to me . "
23871	23908	23833	23833	her	920	" You seem vexed at this , Harriet . I 'm very sorry . Really , it 's the first friend I 've ever had . I 've often felt the need of some such companionship . "
23909	23914	23915	23915	she	920	" I 'm nobody ? "
23967	23975	23976	23976	he	118	" Of course I meant male friend , "
23980	23986	23976	23976	he	118	" You are my sister . "
23987	23994	24002	24002	she	920	" No , I 'm not , "
24024	24033	24034	24034	he	118	" Oh yes , you are , Harriet , "
24040	24057	24034	24034	he	118	" We 've been brother and sister ever since we can remember , have n't we ? "
24058	24069	24071	24072	the girl	316	" But we are n't really , for all that , "
24077	24119	24071	24072	the girl	316	" Well , now you 've got somebody else to take you up , I know very well I shall see less of you . You 'll be making excuses to get out of the rides when the summer comes again . "
24120	24134	24136	24136	Julian	118	" Pray do n't say or think anything of the kind , Harriet , "
24140	24196	24136	24136	Julian	118	" I should not think of letting anything put a stop to our picnics . It will soon be getting warm enough to think of the river , wo n't it ? And then , if you would like it , there is no reason why my friend should n't come with us , sometimes . "
24197	24214	24071	24072	the girl	316	" Oh , nonsense ! Why , you 'd be ashamed to let him know me . "
24215	24236	24136	24136	Julian	118	" Ashamed ! How can you possibly think so ? But you do n't mean it ; you are joking . "
24237	24280	24071	24072	the girl	316	" I 'm sure I 'm not . I should make mistakes in talking , and all sorts of things . You do n't think much of me , as it is , and that would make you like me worse still . "
24304	24314	24315	24315	Julian	118	" Come , Harriet , this is too bad , "
24320	24339	24315	24315	Julian	118	" Why , I shall have to quarrel with you , to prove that we 're good friends . "
24340	24350	24352	24353	the girl	316	" I wish you would quarrel with me sometimes , "
24361	24415	24352	24353	the girl	316	" You take all my bad - temper always just in the same quiet way . I 'd far rather you fell out with me . It 's treating me too like a child , as if it did n't matter how I went on , and I was n't anything to you . "
24547	24558	24559	24559	Harriet	99	" I 'm tired of being ordered about by people ! "
24562	24589	24559	24559	Harriet	99	" I know I sha'n't put up with it much longer . I only wish I 'd a few pounds to start a shop for myself . "
24590	24602	24604	24604	Julian	118	" I heartily wish I had the money to give you , "
24608	24617	24619	24620	his cousin	895	" Do n't you save anything at all ? "
24626	24666	24559	24559	Harriet	99	" A little ; very little . At all events , I think we shall be able to have our week at the seaside when the time comes . Have you thought where you 'd like to go to ? "
24667	24689	24714	24714	Harriet	99	" No ; I have n't thought anything about it . What time shall you get back home to - night ? "
24690	24713	24559	24559	Harriet	99	" Rather late , I dare say . We sit talking and forget the time . It may be after twelve o'clock . "
24811	24820	24822	24822	Harriet	99	" Well , I wo n't keep you , "
24829	24847	24822	24822	Harriet	99	" I know you 're in a hurry to be off . Are you going to walk ? "
24848	24860	24902	24902	Waymark	130	" Yes ; I can do it in about an hour . "
24999	25012	25013	25013	Waymark	130	" What have you ' been doing with yourself this fine day ? "
25023	25035	25037	25037	Julian	118	" I always spend Sunday afternoon with a cousin of mine , "
25049	25054	25077	25077	he	118	" Male or female ? "
25055	25058	25077	25077	he	118	" Female . "
25082	25113	25077	25077	he	118	" We lived together always as children , and were only separated at my uncle 's death , three years ago . She is engaged at a stationer 's shop . "
25114	25125	25126	25126	Waymark	130	" What is a fellow to do to get money ? "
25136	25524	25126	25126	Waymark	130	" I 'm growing sick of this hand - to - mouth existence . Now if one had a bare competency , what glorious possibilities would open out . The vulgar saying has it that ' time is money ; ' like most vulgar sayings putting the thing just the wrong way about . ' Money is time , ' I prefer to say ; it means leisure , and all that follows . Why do n't you write a poem on Money , Casti ? I almost feel capable of it myself . What can claim precedence , in all this world , over hard cash ? It is the fruitful soil wherein is nourished the root of the tree of life ; it is the vivifying principle of human activity . Upon it luxuriate art , letters , science ; rob them of its sustenance , and they droop like withering leaves . Money means virtue ; the lack of it is vice . The devil loves no lurking - place like an empty purse . Give me a thousand pounds to - morrow , and I become the most virtuous man in England . I satisfy all my instincts freely , openly , with no petty makeshifts and vile hypocrisies . To scorn and revile wealth is the mere resource of splenetic poverty . What can not be purchased with coin of the realm ? First and foremost , freedom . The moneyed man is the sole king ; the herds of the penniless are but as slaves before his footstool . He breathes with a sense of proprietorship in the whole globe - enveloping atmosphere ; for is it not in his power to inhale it wheresoever he pleases ? He puts his hand in his pocket , and bids with security for every joy of body and mind ; even death he faces with the comforting consciousness that his defeat will only coincide with that of human science . He buys culture , he buys peace of mind , he buys love . You think not ! I do n't use the word cynically , but in very virtuous earnest . Make me a millionaire , and I will purchase the passionate devotion of any free - hearted woman the world contains ! "
25553	25559	25560	25560	he	130	" That I am poor , "
25565	25779	25560	25560	he	130	" is the result of my own pigheadedness . My father was a stock - broker , in anything but flourishing circumstances . He went in for some cursed foreign loan or other , I know nothing of such things , and ruined himself completely . He had to take a subordinate position , and died in it . I was about seventeen then , and found myself alone in the world . A friend of my father 's , also a city man , Woodstock by name , was left my guardian . He wanted me to begin a business career , and , like a fool , I would n't hear of it . Mr. Woodstock and I quarrelled ; he showed himself worthy of his name , and told me plainly that , if I did n't choose to take his advice , I must shift for myself . That I professed myself perfectly ready to do ; I was bent on an intellectual life , forsooth ; could n't see that the natural order of things was to make money first and be intellectual afterwards . So , lad as I was , I got a place as a teacher , and that 's been my business ever since . "
25805	26015	25788	25788	He	130	" I interested myself in religion and philosophy ; I became an aggressive disciple of free - thought , as it is called . Radicalism of every kind broke out in me , like an ailment . I bought cheap free - thought literature ; to one or two papers of the kind I even contributed . I keep these effusions carefully locked up , for salutary self - humiliation at some future day , when I shall have grown conceited . Nay , I went further . I delivered lectures at working - men 's clubs , lectures with violent titles . One , I remember , was called ' The Gospel of Rationalism . ' And I was enthusiastic in the cause , with an enthusiasm such as I shall never experience again . Can I imagine myself writing and speaking such things now - a - days ? Scarcely : yet the spirit remains , it is only the manifestations which have changed . I am by nature combative ; I feel the need of attacking the cherished prejudices of society ; I have a joy in outraging what are called the proprieties . And I wait for my opportunity , which has yet to come . "
26016	26027	26029	26029	Julian	118	" How commonplace my life has been , in comparison , "
26037	26080	25788	25788	He	130	" Your nature , I believe , is very pure , and therefore very happy . I am what Browning somewhere calls a ' beast with a speckled hide , ' and happiness , I take it , I shall never know . "
26107	26113	26114	26114	he	118	" You will be happy , "
26117	26135	26114	26114	he	118	" when you once find your true work , and feel that you are doing it well . "
26136	26201	26252	26253	The figure	942	" But the motives , the motives ! Never mind , I 've talked enough of myself for one sitting . Do n't think I 've told you everything . Plenty more confessions to come , when time and place shall serve . Little by little you will get to know me , and by then will most likely have had enough of me . "
26202	26214	26114	26114	he	118	" That is not at all likely ; rather the opposite . "
26357	26364	26308	26308	he	118	" a pleasant suburb of southern London "
26377	26457	26308	26308	he	118	" the former a tolerable back - yard , the latter a disused coach - house ; and , as to educational features , offered , at the choice of parents and guardians , either the solid foundation desirable for those youths predestined to a commercial career , or the more liberal training adapted to minds of a professional bias . Anything further in the way of information was to be obtained by applying to the headmaster , Dr. Tootle .
26823	26828	26820	26821	the doctor	3154	" my little compendium . "
26982	26986	26988	26988	his	144	" fill - up "
27378	27511	27353	27354	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Ha ! ha ! you 've come in time , sir ; you 've come in time to hear my resolution . I ca n't stand ut any longer ; I wo n't stand ut a day longer ! Mr. Waymark , you 're a witness of the outrageous way in which I 'm treated in this academy the way in which I 'm treated both by Dr. Tootle and by Mrs. Tootle . You were witness of his insulting behaviour this very afternoon . He openly takes the side of the boys against me ; he ridicules my accent ; he treats me as no gentleman can treat another , unless one of them 's no gentleman at all ! And , Mr. Waymark , I wo n't stand ut ! "
27536	27542	27543	27543	he	130	" You 're quite right , "
27548	27570	27543	27543	he	130	" Tootle 's behaviour was especially scandalous to - day . I should certainly take some kind of notice of it . "
27571	27812	27813	27813	Waymark	130	" Notuss , sir , notuss ! I 'll take that amount of notuss of it that all the metropoluss shall hear of my wrongs . I 'll assault ' um , sir ; I 'll assault ' um in the face of the school , the very next time he dares to provoke me ! I 'll rise in my might , and smite his bald crown with his own ruler ! I 'm not a tall man , Mr. Waymark , but I can reach his crown , and that he shall be aware of before he knows ut . He sets me at naught in my own class , sir ; he pooh - poohs my mathematical demonstrations , sir ; he encourages my pupils in insubordination ! And Mrs. Tootle ! Bedad , if I do n't invent some device for revenging myself on that supercilious woman . The very next time she presumes to address me disrespectfully at the dinner - table , sir , I 'll rise in my might , sir , see if I do n't ! and I 'll say to her , ' Mrs. Tootle , ma'am , you seem to forget that I 'm a gentleman , and have a gentleman 's susceptibilities . When I treat you with disrespect , ma'am , pray tell me of ut , and I 'll inform you you speak an untruth ! ' "
27840	27846	27848	27849	the Irishman	1000	" Waymark , look here ! "
27870	27944	27848	27849	the Irishman	1000	" Here 's Tootle , a veritable Goliath ; here 's me , as it were David . Observe ; Tootle holds in his hand his ' little compendium , ' raised in haughty superciliousness . Observe me with the ruler ! I am on tiptoe ; I am taking aim ; there is wrath in every sinew of my arrum ! My arrum descends on the very centre of Tootle 's bald pate "
27945	27949	27848	27849	the Irishman	1000	" Mr. O'Gree ! "
28039	28052	28013	28013	she	145	" Mr. O'Gree ! Are you aware of my presence , sir ? "
28105	28184	28096	28097	The latter	425	" Well , sir , as soon as you have had enough of your insulting buffoonery , perhaps you will have the goodness to attend to me , and to your duty ! What do you mean by allowing the dormitories to get into this state of uproar ? There 's been a pillow - fight going on for the last half - hour , and you pay no sort of attention ; the very house is shaking ? "
28185	28201	28096	28097	The latter	425	" I protest I had not heard a sound , ma'am , or I should have "
28202	28235	28096	28097	The latter	425	" Perhaps you hear nothing now , sir , and the doctor suffering from one of his very worst headaches , utterly unable to rest even if the house were perfectly quiet ! "
28345	28360	28330	28330	Waymark	130	" In low spirits to - night , I 'm afraid , Mr. Egger ? "
28393	28408	28376	28376	his	149	" Mr. Waymark , I have made my possible ! I can no more ! "
28553	28559	28561	28561	O'Gree	142	" Bedad , my boy , "
28563	28619	28561	28561	O'Gree	142	" I 'm devilish sorry ! I would n't have had it happen for a quarter 's salary , though I sadly need a new pair of breeches . She 's a supercilious cat - o - mountain , and she loses no opportunity of insulting me , but after all she 's a woman . "
28620	28629	28630	28630	he	130	" By - the - by , Waymark , "
28636	28668	28630	28630	he	130	" what a stunner the new governess is ! You 're a lucky dog , to sit in the same room with her . What 's her name , I say ? "
28669	28681	28561	28561	O'Gree	142	" Miss Enderby . You 've seen her , have you ? "
28682	28743	28630	28630	he	130	" I caught a glimpse of her as she came downstairs ; it was quite enough ; she floored me . She 's never been out of my thoughts for a minute since I saw her . ' I love her , I love her , and who shall dare , to chide me for loving that teacher fair ! ' "
28744	28749	28751	28751	Waymark	130	" Well , yes , "
28791	28791	28775	28776	The dragon	1018	"
28792	28815	28816	28816	He	130	" Not civil to her ? If I were present , and heard that woman breathe the slight eat incivility , I 'd "

28841	28857	28838	28838	he	130	" a song ; I beg , a song . Come , I 'll lead off .

30093	30099	30102	30104	Master Percy Tootle	152	" That 's Mr. Waymark , "
30119	30135	30107	30107	his	152	" He 's our drawing - master . Do you like the look of him ? "
30261	30269	30271	30272	Mrs. Tootle	145	" You 'll find my children clever , "
30274	30362	30271	30272	Mrs. Tootle	145	" at least , that has been the opinion of all their teachers hitherto . If they do n't make progress , it certainly will not be their own fault . At the same time , they are high - spirited , and require to be discreetly managed . This , as I previously informed you , must be done without the help of punishment in any shape ; I disapprove of those methods altogether . Now let me hear you give them a lesson in geography . "
30656	30676	30639	30639	Harriet	99	" I may be late back to - night , Mrs. Ogle . You wo n't lock the door ? "
30677	30687	30752	30753	the woman	448	" I sha'n't go to bed till eleven myself , "
30692	30704	30639	30639	Harriet	99	" But it may be after twelve when I get back . "
30705	30714	30639	30639	Harriet	99	" Where are you going to , Harriet ? "
30715	30735	30639	30639	Harriet	99	" If you must know always , Mrs. Ogle , I 'm going to see my friend in Westminster . "
30736	30750	30752	30753	the woman	448	" Well , it ai n't no business of mine , my girl , "
30758	30796	30752	30753	the woman	448	" but I think it 's only right I should have some idea where you spend your nights . As long as you live in my house , I 'm responsible for you , in a way . "
30797	30813	30639	30639	Harriet	99	" I do n't want any one to be responsible for me , Mrs. Ogle . "
30814	30873	30752	30753	the woman	448	" Maybe not , my girl . But young people ai n't always the best judges of what 's good for them , and what is n't . I do n't think your cousin ' ud approve of your being out so late . I shall sit up for you , and you must n't be after twelve . "
31056	31084	31042	31042	She	3216	" I thought it likely you 'd look in , as you missed larst week . How 's things goin' in your part o ' the world ? "
31085	31089	31091	31091	Harriet	99	" Very badly , "
31112	31127	31091	31091	Harriet	99	" It wo n't last much longer , that 's the truth of it . "
31128	31155	31042	31042	She	3216	" Eh well , it 's all in a life ; we all has our little trials an ' troubles , as the sayin ' is . "
31156	31162	31164	31164	Harriet	99	" How 's the baby ? "
31177	31188	31190	31191	the mother	403	" I doubt it 's too good for this world , "
31205	31227	31199	31199	her	403	" Dessay it 'll join its little brother an ' sister before long . Mike put it in the club yes'day . "
31244	31249	31252	31253	the woman	448	" Have you walked ? "
31266	31283	31284	31284	she	153	" Dessay you could do with somethin' to take the cold orff yer chest . Liz , "
31304	31308	31284	31284	she	153	" two Irish ! "
31454	31521	31433	31433	she	153	" No , you do n't , Slimy ! No , you do n't ! What you have in this house you pay for in coppers , so you know . Next time I catch you tryin ' to ring the changes , I 'll have you run in , and then you 'll get a warm bath , which you would n't partic'lar care for . "
31541	31580	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" If you 've any accusion to make agin me , Mrs. Sprowl , p'r'aps you 'll wait till you can prove it . I want change for arf a suvrin : ai n't that straight , now ? "
31581	31619	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" Straight or not , you wo n't get no change over this counter , so there you 've the straight tip . Now sling yer ' ook , Slimy , an ' get it somewhere else . "
31620	31628	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" If you 've any accusion to make "
31629	31641	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" Hold yer noise ! What 's he ordered , Liz ? "
31642	31649	31651	31652	the girl	316	" Pot o ' old six , "
31654	31660	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" Got sixpence , Slimy ? "
31661	31671	31673	31674	the creature	1108	" No , I ai n't , Mrs. Sprowl , "
31676	31684	31673	31674	the creature	1108	" I 've got arf a suvrin . "
31685	31705	31522	31523	The creature	1108	" Then go an ' get change for it . Now , once more , sling yer ' ook . "
31730	31743	31744	31744	Harriet	99	" I wish you 'd take me on as barmaid , Sarah , "
31756	31761	31763	31764	the other	449	" Take you on ? "
31769	31790	31763	31764	the other	449	" Why , have you fallen out with your cousin ? I thought you was goin' to be married soon . "
31791	31829	31722	31723	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" I did n't say for sure that I was ; I only said I might be . Any way it wo n't be just yet , and I 'm tired of my place in the shop . "
31830	31840	31842	31843	the other	449	" Do n't you be a fool , Harriet , "
31849	31965	31842	31843	the other	449	" You 're well enough off . You stick where you are till you get married . You would n't make nothin' at our business ; ' tain't all sugar an ' lemon , an ' sittin ' drinkin ' twos o ' whisky till further orders . You want a quiet , easy business , you do , an ' you 've got it . If you keep worritin ' yerself this way , you wo n't never make old bones , an ' that 's the truth . You wait a bit , an ' give yer cousin a chance to arst you , if that 's what you 're troublin ' about . "
31966	31976	31978	31978	Harriet	99	" I 've given him lots o ' chances , "
31981	32014	31842	31843	the other	449	" Eh well , give him lots more , an ' it 'll all come right . We 're all born , but we 're not buried . Hev ' another Irish ? "
32415	32460	32365	32365	he	1127	" In the second century of the Christian AEra , the empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth , and the most civilised portion of mankind . The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour . "
32607	32612	32632	32632	he	118	" Decline and Fall , "
32641	32643	32644	32644	he	118	" Stilicho "
32763	32766	32744	32744	he	118	" Stilicho , "
32923	32929	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" How could it be ? "
32934	32945	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" I ca n't be in two places at once . "
32946	32955	32921	32921	she	316	" Did you stay at home that evening ? "
32956	32964	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" No , not all the evening . "
32965	32983	32921	32921	she	316	" What friends are they you go to , when you are out at night , Harriet ? "
32984	33009	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" Oh , some relations of the Colchester people . I suppose you 've been spending most of your time in Kennington since Sunday ? "
33010	33041	32921	32921	she	316	" I have n't left home . In fact , I 've been very busy . I 've just finished some work that has occupied me for nearly a year . "
33066	33072	33074	33074	Harriet	99	" Work ? What work ? "
33095	33105	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" Some writing . I 've written a play . "
33106	33115	32921	32921	she	316	" A play ? Will it be acted ? "
33116	33127	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" Oh no , it is n't meant for acting . "
33128	33137	32921	32921	she	316	" What 's the good of it then ? "
33138	33154	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" It 's written in verse . I shall perhaps try to get it published . "
33155	33163	32921	32921	she	316	" Shall you get money for it ? "
33164	33185	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" That is scarcely likely . In all probability I shall not be able to get it printed at all . "
33186	33195	33197	33197	Harriet	99	" Then what 's the good of it ? "
33207	33218	32931	32931	Harriet	99	" It has given me pleasure , that 's all . "
33243	33343	33369	33369	he	130	" Why did you keep it such a secret ? I shall try my hand at a play some day or other , but , as you can guess , the material will scarcely be sought in Gibbon . It will be desperately modern , and possibly not altogether in accordance with the views of the Lord Chamberlain . What 's the time ? Four o'clock . We 'll have a cup of coffee and then fall to . I 'm eager to hear your ' deep - chested music , ' your ' hollow oes and aes . ' "
33425	33438	33439	33439	he	118	" It 's very kind of you to speak in this way , "
33444	33478	33439	33439	he	118	" Kind ! How the deuce should I speak ? But come , we will have this off to a publisher 's forth with . Have you any ideas for the next work ? "
33479	33493	33439	33439	he	118	" Yes ; but so daring that they hardly bear putting into words . "
33494	33501	33439	33439	he	118	" Try the effect on me . "
33502	33507	33509	33509	Julian	118	" I have thought , "
33514	33565	33509	33509	Julian	118	" of a long poem an Epic . Virgil wrote of the founding of Rome ; her dissolution is as grand a subject . It would mean years of preparation , and again years in the writing . The siege and capture of Rome by Alaric what do you think ? "
33566	33589	33439	33439	he	118	" A work not to be raised from the heat of youth , or the vapours of wine . But who knows ? "
34162	34168	34169	34169	she	145	" Bon jour , Monsieur , "
34175	34194	34169	34169	she	145	" Quel un beau matin ! Vous trouverez les jeunes dames et messieurs en bons esprits ce matin . "
34238	34242	34244	34245	his mother	1172	" Monsieur Felix , "
34247	34274	34244	34245	his mother	1172	" que faites - vous la ? Les jeunes messieurs anglais sont plus spirituels que les jeunes messieurs suisses , n'est ce pas , Monsieur Egger ? "
34275	34281	34283	34284	the teacher	325	" En effet , madame , "
34291	34295	34297	34298	Mrs. Tootle	145	" Monsieur Egger , "
34307	34328	34297	34298	Mrs. Tootle	145	" est - ce vrai ce qu'on dit que les Suisses sont si excessivement sujets a etre chez - malades ? "
34513	34531	34501	34501	he	130	" Let me , let me ! I have made my possible ; I can no more ! "
34590	34599	34600	34600	she	262	" Do n't you think , Mr. Waymark , "
34630	34659	34600	34600	she	262	" do n't you think it would be better to confine yourself to the terms of the doctor 's little compendium ? The boys are used to it . "
34660	34665	34667	34667	Waymark	130	" In this case , "
34670	34687	34667	34667	Waymark	130	" I think the terms of the compendium are rather too technical for the fourth class . "
34688	34727	34600	34600	she	262	" Still , it is customary in this school to use the compendium , and it has never yet been found unsatisfactory . Whilst you are discoursing at such length , I observe your class gets very disorderly . "
34742	34752	34753	34753	she	262	" What are you waiting for , Mr. Waymark ? "
34757	34773	34600	34600	she	262	" Till your presence has ceased to distract the boys ' attention , Mrs. Tootle , "
34917	34920	34951	34951	Waymark	130	" good morning "
35009	35019	35020	35020	he	130	" I fear your pupils give you dreadful trouble , "
35040	35047	35048	35048	she	1197	" They are full of life , "
35062	35076	35078	35078	Waymark	130	" Which would all seem to be directed towards shortening that of others , "
35084	35089	35090	35091	the governess	1194	" They are intelligent , "
35100	35119	35090	35091	the governess	1194	" It would be a pleasure to teach them if they if they were a little more orderly . "
35120	35130	35090	35091	the governess	1194	" Certainly . If their parents had only common sense "
35181	35184	35176	35177	Miss Enderby	150	" good morning "
35242	35253	35254	35254	He	130	" Maud Enderby , South Bank , Regent 's Park . "
35602	35606	35598	35599	Miss Enderby	150	" good morning . "
36016	36027	36029	36029	O'Gree	142	" The light of my life will be gone out , "
36031	36109	36029	36029	O'Gree	142	" when I am no longer able to catch a glimpse of her as she goes past the schoolroom door . And I 've never even had a chance of speaking to her . You know the tale of Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth . Suppose I were to rush out and throw my top - coat on the muddy door - step , just as she 's going out ; d'ye think she 'd say thank you ? "
36110	36113	36115	36115	Waymark	130	" Probably , "
36154	36196	36120	36120	he	130	" Bedad , I 'll do it then ! Or , rather , I would , if I 'd two top - coats . Hang it ! There 's no behaving like a gentleman on twenty - five pounds a year . "
36235	36243	36244	36245	the doctor	3154	" You seem indisposed , Mr. Waymark , "
36262	36271	36272	36273	the other	449	" I am a little out of sorts , "
36277	36289	36272	36273	the other	449	" Perhaps we could talk about these things to - morrow . "
36290	36295	36297	36298	Dr. Tootle	141	" As you please , "
36479	36482	36484	36485	Miss Enderby	150	" Felix , "
36487	36502	36484	36485	Miss Enderby	150	" give me your copy - book and go to the drawing - lesson . "
36832	36837	36839	36840	Mrs. Tootle	145	" You brutal ruffian ! "
36842	36862	36839	36840	Mrs. Tootle	145	" How dare you touch my child ? You shall answer for this in the police court , sir . "
36863	36866	36868	36869	her husband	584	" Waymark , "
36884	36907	36868	36869	her husband	584	" what 's the meaning of this ? You forget yourself , sir . Who gave you authority to use corporal chastisement ? "
36908	36918	36919	36919	he	584	" The boy has long deserved a good thrashing , "
36922	36967	36919	36919	he	584	" and I 'm glad I lost my temper sufficiently to give him a portion of his deserts . If you wish to know the immediate cause , it simply was that he threw a book at his governess 's head and hit her . "
36968	36972	36975	36976	the doctor	3154	" Mr. O'Gree , "
36978	37041	36975	36976	the doctor	3154	" take your boys back to their duties , sir ! I am quite unable to understand this disgraceful lack of discipline . Every boy who is not at his seat in one minute will have five hundred verses of the Psalms to write out ! Mr. Waymark , I shall be obliged to you if you will step into my study . "
37066	37069	37070	37070	he	3154	" Really , "
37073	37157	37070	37070	he	3154	" it 's a great pity you let yourself be carried away like that . I think it very probable indeed that Felix deserved castigation of some kind , but you would have done much better to report him to me , you know , and let me see to it . You have put me in an awkward position . I fear you must make an apology to Mrs. Tootle , and then perhaps the matter can be allowed to blow over . "
37158	37163	37165	37165	Waymark	130	" I think not , "
37203	37227	37181	37181	his	130	" I do n't feel disposed to apologise , and I am tired of my position here . I must give it up . "
37251	37260	37261	37261	he	141	" Come , you do n't mean this , "
37264	37315	37261	37261	he	141	" You are out of temper for the moment . Perhaps the apology could be dispensed with ; I think I may promise that it can be . The lad will be no worse for his little correction . Possibly we can come to some more satisfactory arrangements for the future "
37316	37319	37321	37321	Waymark	130	" No , "
37323	37360	37321	37321	Waymark	130	" I have quite made up my mind . I mean to give up teaching altogether ; it does n't suit me . Of course I am willing to come as usual the next two days . "
37361	37380	37382	37383	the principal	1257	" You are aware that this notice should have been given me at the beginning of the quarter ? "
37385	37404	37261	37261	he	141	" Oh yes . Of course you will legally owe me nothing . I am prepared for that . "
37405	37421	37261	37261	he	141	" Well , I shall have to consider it . But I still think that you "
37422	37440	37261	37261	he	141	" As far as I am concerned , the matter is decided . I go at Easter . "
37441	37483	37261	37261	he	141	" Very well . I think you are blind to your own interest , but of course you do as you please . If Mrs. Tootle should press me to take out a summons against you for assault , of course I "
37484	37491	37261	37261	he	141	" Good morning , Dr. Tootle . "
37607	37715	37726	37726	Casti	118	" So there ends another chapter . How many more to the end of the story ? How many more scenes till the farce is played out ? There is something flattering to one 's vanity in this careless playing with fate ; it is edifying , moreover , to sot circumstances at defiance in this way , now and then , to assert one 's freedom . Freedom ! What a joke the word must be to whoever is pulling the wires and making us poor puppets dance at his pleasure . Pity that we have to pay the piper so heavily for our involuntary jigging ! "
38057	38065	38070	38070	he	130	" South Bank , Regent 's Park . "
38409	38424	38402	38402	he	130	" I came here to try and discover where you lived , Miss Enderby . "
38450	38457	38458	38458	he	130	" Pray do n't misunderstand me , "
38463	38501	38458	38458	he	130	" I wished , if possible , to well , to tell you that I feared I acted thoughtlessly the other day ; without regard , I mean , to any consequences it might have for yourself . "
38502	38540	38441	38442	The girl	316	" Rather I ought to thank you for defending me . It made no difference in the way you mean . It had already been decided that I should leave . I did not suit Mrs. Tootle . "
38617	38630	38631	38631	he	130	" You were certainly unsuited for the work , in every way , "
38638	38655	38631	38631	he	130	" Your efforts were quite wasted there . Still , I am sorry you have left . "
38656	38664	38666	38666	her	316	" I am going into a family , "
38674	38706	38666	38666	her	316	" It is in the country , in Essex . There are only two children , quite young . I think I shall succeed better with them ; I hope so . "
38707	38712	38713	38713	Waymark	130	" Then I suppose , "
38731	38748	38721	38721	his	130	" I shall I must say good - bye to you , for the last time ? "
38752	38754	38757	38757	her	316	" yes "
38766	38776	38777	38777	Waymark	130	" I am going to make a bold request , "
38796	38807	38787	38787	his	130	" Will you tell me where you are going to ? "
38844	38886	38808	38808	She	316	" Will you let me write to you occasionally ? Would you let me keep up our acquaintance in this way , so that , if you return to London , I might look forward to meeting you again some time ? "
38891	38911	38887	38888	The girl	316	" I shall be glad to keep up our acquaintance . I shall be glad to hear from you . "
38942	38948	38949	38949	he	130	" Thank you very much , "
38953	38959	38949	38949	he	130	" I am very grateful . "
38965	38970	38960	38960	She	316	" good - bye , "
40077	40084	40085	40085	she	316	" Are you coming with me ? "
40104	40110	40111	40111	Waymark	130	" Good God , no ! "
40114	40123	40111	40111	Waymark	130	" Go home and take care of yourself . "
40199	40206	40207	40207	she	1304	" That a friend of yours ? "
40234	40245	40223	40223	Waymark	130	" Then why did you give her all that money ? "
40246	40256	40212	40212	her	1304	" How do you know what I gave her ? "
40257	40269	40223	40223	Waymark	130	" I was standing just behind here , and could see . "
40270	40273	40212	40212	her	1304	" Well ? "
40274	40318	40223	40223	Waymark	130	" Nothing ; only I should think you are one out of a thousand . You saved me a sovereign , too ; I 've watched her begging of nearly a dozen people , and I could n't have stood it much longer . "
40319	40328	40212	40212	her	1304	" You would have given her a sovereign ? "
40329	40341	40223	40223	Waymark	130	" I meant to , if she 'd failed with you . "
40342	40350	40212	40212	her	1304	" Is she a friend of yours ? "
40351	40360	40223	40223	Waymark	130	" Never saw her before to - night . "
40361	40372	40212	40212	her	1304	" Then you must be one out of a thousand . "
40378	40383	40384	40384	she	316	" In that case , "
40387	40399	40384	40384	she	316	" we ought to know each other , should n't we ? "
40400	40412	40414	40414	Waymark	130	" If we began by thinking so well of each other , "
40418	40430	40414	40414	Waymark	130	" we should not improbably suffer a grievous disappointment before long . "
40431	40453	40212	40212	her	1304	" Well , you might . You have to take my generosity on trust , but I have proof of yours . "
40454	40463	40465	40465	Waymark	130	" You 're an original sort of girl , "
40475	40485	40472	40472	his	130	" Do you talk to everybody in this way ? "
40486	40531	40212	40212	her	1304	" Pooh , of course not . I should n't be worth much if I could n't suit my conversation to the man I want to make a fool of . Would you rather have me talk in the usual way ? Shall I say "
40532	40538	40472	40472	his	130	" I had rather not . "
40539	40546	40212	40212	her	1304	" Well , I knew that . "
40547	40551	40472	40472	his	130	" And how ? "
40552	40566	40212	40212	her	1304	" Well , you do n't wear a veil , if I do . "
40567	40573	40472	40472	his	130	" You can read faces ? "
40574	40585	40212	40212	her	1304	" A little , I flatter myself . Can you ? "
40586	40594	40472	40472	his	130	" Give me a chance of trying . "
40612	40621	40622	40622	he	1307	" Excellently well , if God did all , "
40629	40637	40638	40638	she	1306	" That 's out of a play , "
40642	40710	40638	40638	she	1306	" I heard it a little time ago , but I forget the answer . I 'd have given anything to be able to cap you ! Then you 'd have put me down for a clever woman , and I should have lived on the reputation henceforth and for ever . But it 's all my own , indeed ; I 'm not afraid of crying . "
40711	40724	40743	40743	her	1306	" Do you ever cry ? I ca n't easily imagine it . "
40725	40731	40732	40732	she	1306	" Oh yes , sometimes , "
40747	40758	40732	40732	she	1306	" But you have n't read my face for me . "
40759	40771	40743	40743	her	1306	" It 's a face I 'm sorry to have seen . "
40772	40775	40776	40776	she	1306	" Why ? "
40791	40819	40743	40743	her	1306	" I shall think of it often after tonight , and imagine it with all its freshness gone , and marks of suffering and degradation upon it . "
40820	40835	40743	40743	her	1306	" Suffering , perhaps ; degradation , no . Why should I be degraded ? "
40836	40853	40743	40743	her	1306	" You ca n't help yourself . The life you have chosen brings its inevitable consequences . "
40854	40857	40858	40858	she	1306	" Chosen ! "
40866	40890	40858	40858	she	1306	" How do you know I had any choice in the matter ? You have no right to speak contemptuously , like that . "
40891	40909	40743	40743	her	1306	" Perhaps not . Certainly not . I should have said the life you are evidently leading . "
40910	40963	40858	40858	she	1306	" Well , I do n't know that it makes so much difference . I suppose everybody has a choice at all events between life and death , and you mean that I ought to have killed myself rather than come to this . That 's my own business , however , and "
41011	41019	41020	41020	she	1306	" Are you walking up Regent Street ? "
41030	41039	41020	41020	she	1306	" Give me your arm , will you ? "
41053	41061	41062	41062	he	1260	" What is the matter with you ? "
41065	41071	41062	41062	he	1260	" Why are you trembling ? "
41072	41091	41050	41050	she	1306	" Do n't look round . It 's that fellow behind us ; I know he is following . "
41092	41097	41062	41062	he	1260	" Somebody you know ? "
41098	41124	41050	41050	she	1306	" Yes , and hate . Worse than that , I 'm afraid of him . Will you keep with me till he 's gone ? "
41125	41139	41062	41062	he	1260	" Of course I will . What harm can he do you though ? "
41140	41170	41050	41050	she	1306	" None that I know of . It 's a strange stupid feeling I have . I ca n't bear the sight of him . Do n't look round ! "
41171	41181	41062	41062	he	1260	" Has he been a a friend of yours ? "
41182	41209	41050	41050	she	1306	" No , no ; not in that way . But he follows me about . He 'll drive me out of London , I know . "
41216	41221	41222	41222	she	1312	" Look back now , "
41225	41234	41222	41222	she	1312	" and see if he 's following still . "
41292	41301	41302	41303	the girl	316	" Let 's make haste round the corner , "
41306	41321	41302	41303	the girl	316	" and get into the restaurant . You must have some supper with me . "
41322	41337	41273	41273	He	491	" I should be very happy , had I a penny in my pocket . "
41338	41347	41349	41350	the other	449	" See how easily good deeds are forgotten , "
41358	41378	41349	41350	the other	449	" Now comes my turn to give proof of generosity . Come and have some supper all the same . "
41379	41389	41273	41273	He	491	" No ; that 's out of the question . "
41390	41418	41349	41350	the other	449	" Fiddlestick Surely you wo n't desert me when I ask your protection ? Come along , and pay me back another time , if you like . "
41524	41550	41510	41510	He	130	" Is n't this the man who followed us just coming in now ? Look , he has gone to the table on the right . "
41568	41575	41576	41576	she	316	" Why did you tell me ? "
41580	41603	41576	41576	she	316	" Now I ca n't finish my supper . Wait till he has given his order , and then we will go . "
41766	41776	41777	41778	the girl	316	" Are you in a hurry to get home ? "
41789	41800	41777	41778	the girl	316	" No ; time is of no consequence to me . "
41801	41808	41777	41778	the girl	316	" Do you live far off ? "
41809	41816	41777	41778	the girl	316	" In Kennington . And you ? "
41817	41837	41777	41778	the girl	316	" If you like , I 'll show you . Let us walk quickly . I feel rather cold . "
41861	41871	41873	41873	Waymark	130	" This is a queer place to live in , "
41884	41890	41899	41899	she	316	" Do n't be afraid , "
41956	41961	41962	41962	Waymark	130	" Do you play ? "
41975	42006	41962	41962	Waymark	130	" I only wish I could . My landlady 's daughter is giving me lessons . But I think I 'm getting on . Listen to me do this exercise . "
42036	42039	42040	42040	she	316	" Well , "
42047	42071	42040	42040	she	316	" you must begin at the beginning in everything , must n't you ? Come and let me hear what you can do . "
42072	42078	42025	42025	she	316	" Not even so much . "
42079	42124	42040	42040	she	316	" Then do n't laugh at a poor girl doing her best . You have such a queer smile too ; it seems both ill - natured and good - natured at the same time . Now wait a minute till I come back . "
42184	42201	42171	42171	she	316	" This is my child . Do n't you admire him ? Shake hands , Grim . "
42202	42206	42146	42146	She	316	" Why Grim ? "
42207	42357	42171	42171	she	316	" It 's short for Grimalkin . The name of a cat in a hook of fairy tales I used to be fond of reading . Do n't you think he 's got a beautiful face , and a good deal more intelligent than some people we could mention ? I picked him up on our door - step , two months ago . Oh , you never saw such a wretched little object , dripping with rain , and with such a poor starved little face , and bones almost coming through the skin . He looked up at me , and begged me as plain as plain could be to have pity on him and help him ; did n't you , Grimmy ? And so I brought him upstairs , and made him comfortable , and now we shall never part . Do you like animals ? "
42358	42361	42146	42146	She	316	" Yes . "
42407	42414	42416	42416	Grim	169	" What is it , Sally ? "
42427	42450	42396	42396	She	1348	" Why , Mrs. Walter told me you was n't in yet ; I 'm awful sorry , I beg your pardon . "
42463	42469	42451	42451	She	1350	" Do you want me ? "
42470	42477	42479	42479	Sally	105	" It 's only for Grim , "
42491	42515	42484	42484	she	105	" I 'd brought un home a bit o ' fish , a nice bit without bone ; it 'll just suit he . "
42516	42524	42451	42451	She	1350	" Then come and give it he , "
42536	42548	42451	42451	She	1350	" But he must n't make a mess on the hearthrug . "
42549	42557	42559	42559	Sally	105	" Oh , trust un for that , "
42561	42571	42559	42559	Sally	105	" He wo n't pull it off the paper . "
42586	42591	42451	42451	She	1350	" good - night . "
42592	42597	42598	42598	Waymark	130	" Who 's that ? "
42601	42610	42598	42598	Waymark	130	" Where on earth does she come from ? "
42611	42644	42451	42451	She	1350	" She 's from Weymouth . They talk queerly there , do n't they ? She lives in the house , and goes to business . Sally and I are great friends . "
42645	42653	42654	42654	Waymark	130	" Do you come from the country ? "
42672	42696	42451	42451	She	1350	" No , I 'm a London girl . I 've never been out of the town since I was a little child . "
42697	42705	42451	42451	She	1350	" And how old are you now ? "
42706	42709	42451	42451	She	1350	" Guess . "
42710	42714	42451	42451	She	1350	" Not twenty . "
42715	42731	42451	42451	She	1350	" Eighteen a month ago . All my life before me , is n't it ? "
42739	42747	42748	42748	she	1351	" How do you like my room ? "
42755	42791	42451	42451	She	1350	" It 's very comfortable . I always thought there were nothing but business places all about here . I should rather like to live in the very middle of the town , like this . "
42792	42860	42732	42732	Waymark	130	" Should you ? That 's just what I like . Oh , how I enjoy the noise and the crowds ! I should be ill if I had to live in one of those long , dismal streets , where the houses are all the same shape , and costermongers go bawling about all day long . I suppose you live in a place like that ? "
42861	42867	42451	42451	She	1350	" Very much the same . "
42913	42918	42920	42921	the girl	316	" What 's that ? "
42923	42942	42920	42921	the girl	316	" Will you let me look ? Is it a tale ? Lend it me ; will you ? "
42943	42949	42451	42451	She	1350	" Do you read books ? "
42950	42975	42920	42921	the girl	316	" Oh yes ; why not ? Let me keep this till you come again . Is this your name written here Osmond Waymark ? "
42976	42985	42451	42451	She	1350	" Yes . And what is your name ? "
42986	42990	42920	42921	the girl	316	" Ida Starr . "
42991	43016	42451	42451	She	1350	" Ida ? That 's a beautiful name . I was almost afraid to ask you , for fear it should be something common . "
43017	43028	42920	42921	the girl	316	" And why should n't I have a common name ? "
43029	43040	42451	42451	She	1350	" Because you are by no means a common girl . "
43041	43065	42920	42921	the girl	316	" You think not ? Well , perhaps you are right . But may I keep the book till I see you again ? "
43066	43086	42451	42451	She	1350	" I had better give it you , for it is n't very likely you will see me again . "
43087	43091	42920	42921	the girl	316	" Why not ? "
43092	43114	42451	42451	She	1350	" My acquaintance would be anything but profitable to you . I often have n't enough money to live on , and "
43149	43156	43157	43157	she	101	" But you are a gentleman , "
43175	43182	43157	43157	she	101	" Are you in the city ? "
43183	43189	43157	43157	she	101	" The Lord deliver me ! "
43190	43194	43157	43157	she	101	" What then ? "
43195	43200	43157	43157	she	101	" I am nothing . "
43201	43208	43157	43157	she	101	" Then you must be rich . "
43209	43237	43157	43157	she	101	" It by no means follows . Yesterday I was a teacher in a school . To - day I am what is called out of work . "
43238	43251	43157	43157	she	101	" A teacher . But I suppose you 'll get another place . "
43252	43269	43157	43157	she	101	" No . I 've given it up because I could n't endure it any longer . "
43270	43279	43157	43157	she	101	" And how are you going to live ? "
43280	43286	43157	43157	she	101	" I have no idea . "
43287	43306	43157	43157	she	101	" Then you must have been very foolish to give away your money like that to - night . "
43307	43345	43157	43157	she	101	" I do n't pretend to much wisdom . If I had had another sovereign in my pocket , no doubt I should have given it you before this , and you would n't have refused it . "
43346	43352	43353	43353	she	1354	" How do you know ? "
43357	43365	43353	43353	she	1354	" Why should you think me selfish ? "
43366	43397	43157	43157	she	101	" Certainly I have no reason to . And by the by , I already owe you money for the supper . I will send it you to - morrow . "
43398	43404	43353	43353	she	1354	" Why not bring it ? "
43405	43434	43157	43157	she	101	" Better not . I have a good deal of an unpleasant quality which people call pride , and I do n't care to make myself uncomfortable unnecessarily . "
43435	43448	43449	43449	She	1354	" You ca n't have more pride than I have . Look . "
43455	43470	43449	43449	She	1354	" Will you be my friend , really my friend ? You understand me ? "
43471	43485	43157	43157	she	101	" I think I understand , but I doubt whether it is possible . "
43486	43539	43449	43449	She	1354	" Everything is possible . Will you shake hands with me , and , when you come to see me again , let us meet as if I were a modest girl , and you had got to know me in a respectable house , and not in the street at midnight ? "
43540	43551	43157	43157	she	101	" You really wish it ? You are not joking ? "
43552	43569	43449	43449	She	1354	" I am in sober earnest , and I wish it . You wo n't refuse ? "
43570	43581	43157	43157	she	101	" If I did I should refuse a great happiness . "
43591	43599	43601	43601	she	1356	" And now look at the time , "
43611	43623	43601	43601	she	1356	" Half - past one . How will you get home ? "
43624	43646	43449	43449	She	1354	" Walk . It wo n't take me more than an hour . May I light my pipe before I start ? "
43647	43660	43601	43601	she	1356	" Of course you may . When shall I see you again ? "
43661	43670	43449	43449	She	1354	" Shall we say this night next week ? "
43671	43703	43601	43601	she	1356	" Very well . Come here any time you like in the evening . I will be at home after six . And then I can give you your book back . "
44249	44252	44253	44253	Waymark	129	" Halloa ! "
44256	44272	44253	44253	Waymark	129	" I thought you told me you were engaged with your cousin to - day . "
44273	44293	44372	44372	It	1365	" I was , but I sent her a note yesterday to say I was unable to meet her . "
44294	44321	44253	44253	Waymark	129	" Then why did n't you write at the same time and tell me you were coming ? I might have gone out for the day . "
44322	44331	44372	44372	It	1365	" I had no intention of coming then . "
44332	44344	44253	44253	Waymark	129	" What 's the matter ? You look out of sorts . "
44345	44371	44372	44372	It	1365	" I do n't feel in very good spirits . By the by , I heard from the publishers yesterday . Here 's the note . "
44391	44394	44372	44372	It	1365	" Stilicho , "
44449	44457	44459	44459	Waymark	129	" Well , it 's a disappointment , "
44461	44537	44459	44459	Waymark	129	" but we must try again . I myself am so hardened to this kind of thing that I fear you will think me unsympathetic . It 's like having a tooth out . You never quite get used to it , but you learn after two or three experiments to gauge the moment 's torture at its true value . Re - direct your parcel , and fresh hope beats out the old discouragement . "
44538	44553	44554	44554	Casti	116	" It was n't altogether that which was making me feel restless and depressed , "
44568	44670	44554	44554	Casti	116	" I suppose I 'm not quite right in health just at present . I seem to have lost my natural good spirits of late ; the worst of it is , I ca n't settle to my day 's work as I used to . In fact , I have just been applying for a new place , that of dispenser at the All Saints ' Hospital . If I get it , it would make my life a good deal more independent . I should live in lodgings of my own , and have much more time to myself . "
44709	44719	44694	44694	he	129	" Waymark , have you ever been in love ? "
44730	44735	44737	44737	his	129	" Many thousand times , "
44740	44746	44748	44748	Julian	118	" No , but seriously , "
44750	44766	44694	44694	he	129	" With desperate seriousness for two or three days at a time . Never longer . "
44767	44818	44748	44748	Julian	118	" Well now , answer me in all earnestness . Do you believe it possible to love a woman whom in almost every respect you regard as your inferior , who you know ca n't understand your thoughts and aspirations , who has no interest in anything above daily needs ? "
44819	44830	44694	44694	he	129	" Impossible to say . Is she good - looking ? "
44831	44842	44748	44748	Julian	118	" Suppose she is not ; yet not altogether plain . "
44843	44850	44694	44694	he	129	" Then does she love you ? "
44858	44864	44748	44748	Julian	118	" Suppose she seems to . "
44865	44946	44748	44748	Julian	118	" Seems to , eh ? On the whole , I should say that I could n't declare it possible or the contrary till I had seen the girl . I myself should be very capable of falling desperately in love with a girl who had n't an idea in her head , and did n't know her letters . All I should ask would be passion in return , and well , yes , a pliant and docile character . "
44947	44981	44748	44748	Julian	118	" You are right ; the character would go for much . Never mind , we wo n't speak any more of the subject . It was an absurd question to ask you . "
44982	44992	44748	44748	Julian	118	" Nevertheless , you have made me very curious . "
44993	45020	44748	44748	Julian	118	" I will tell you more some other time ; not now . Tell me about your own plans . What decision have you come to ? "
45274	45277	45278	45278	he	1375	" Ah ! "
45285	45299	45278	45278	he	1375	" You ! I 've been wondering where you were to be found . "
45325	45332	45333	45333	Waymark	129	" You wanted to see me ? "
45336	45350	45300	45301	The visitor	842	" Well , yes . I suppose you 've come about the mines . "
45351	45357	45320	45320	he	842	" Mines ? What mines ? "
45358	45384	45300	45301	The visitor	842	" Oh , then you have n't come about them . You did n't know the Llwg Valley people have begun to pay a dividend ? "
45456	45461	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" In other words , "
45466	45473	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" they owe me some money ? "
45474	45483	45485	45485	Abraham	115	" Which you can do with , eh ? "
45499	45507	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" Perfectly . What are the details ? "
45508	45522	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" There are fifty ten - pound shares . Dividend accordingly twenty pounds . "
45523	45535	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" By Jingo ! How is it to be got at ? "
45536	45546	45548	45550	the old man	1383	" Do you feel disposed to sell the shares ? "
45560	45570	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" No ; on the whole I think not . "
45571	45609	45463	45463	Waymark	129	" Ho , ho , Osmond , where have you learnt prudence , eh ? Why do n't you sit down ? If you did n't come about the mines , why did you come , eh ? "
45610	45616	45618	45618	Waymark	129	" Not to mince matters , "
45638	45655	45618	45618	Waymark	129	" I came to ask you to help me to some way of getting a living . "
45656	45659	45661	45663	the old man	1383	" Hollo ! "
45667	45691	45661	45663	the old man	1383	" Why , I should have thought you 'd made your fortune by this time . Poetry does n't pay , it seems ? "
45692	45747	45618	45618	Waymark	129	" It does n't . One has to buy experience . It 's no good saying that I ought to have been guided by you five years ago . Of course I wish I had been , but it was n't possible . The question is , do you care to help me now ? "
45748	45754	45756	45756	Abraham	115	" What 's your idea ? "
45776	45901	45618	45618	Waymark	129	" I have none . I only know that I 've been half - starved for years in the cursed business of teaching , and that I ca n't stand it any longer . I want some kind of occupation that will allow me to have three good meals every day , and leave me my evenings free . That is n't asking much , I imagine ; most men manage to find it . I do n't care what the work is , not a bit . If it 's of a kind which gives a prospect of getting on , all the better ; if that 's out of the question , well , three good meals and a roof shall suffice . "
45902	45914	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" You 're turning out a devilish sensible lad , Osmond , "
45922	46001	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Better late than never , as they say . But I do n't see what you can do . You literary chaps get into the way of thinking that any fool can make a man of business , and that it 's only a matter of condescending to turn your hands to desk work and the ways clear before you . It 's a mistake , and you 're not the first that 'll find it out . "
46002	46008	46010	46010	Waymark	129	" This much I know , "
46015	46044	46010	46010	Waymark	129	" Set me to anything that can be learnt , and I 'll be perfect in it in a quarter the time it would take the average man . "
46045	46052	46054	46055	the other	449	" You want your evenings free ? "
46062	46070	46054	46055	the other	449	" What will you do with them ? "
46071	46080	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" I shall give them to literary work . "
46081	46136	46054	46055	the other	449	" I thought as much . And you think you can be a man of business and a poet at the same time ? No go , my boy . If you take up business , you drop poetising . Those two horses never yet pulled at the same shaft , and never will . "
46170	46176	46177	46177	he	114	" I tell you what , "
46181	46215	46177	46177	he	114	" There 's only one thing I know of at present that you 're likely to be able to do . Suppose I gave you the job of collecting my rents down east . "
46216	46220	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Weekly rents ? "
46221	46256	46177	46177	he	114	" Weekly . It 's a rough quarter , and they 're a shady lot of customers . You would n't find the job over - pleasant , but you might try , eh ? "
46257	46273	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" What would it bring me in , to go at once to the point ? "
46274	46309	46177	46177	he	114	" The rents average twenty - five pounds . Your commission would be seven per cent . You might reckon , I dare say , on five - and - thirty shillings a week . "
46310	46318	45916	45917	Mr. Woodstock	114	" What is the day for collecting ? "
46319	46362	46177	46177	he	114	" Mondays ; but there 's lots of 'em you 'd have to look up several times in a week . If you like I 'll go round myself on Tuesday Easter Monday 's no good and you can come with me . "
46363	46372	46374	46374	Waymark	129	" I will go , by all means , "
46398	46403	46405	46406	the other	449	" Well , well , "
46408	46454	46405	46406	the other	449	" wait till we see how things work . I should n't wonder if you throw it up after a week or two . However , be here on Tuesday at ten . And prompt , mind : I do n't wait for any man . "
46504	46508	46509	46509	he	114	" You see , "
46512	46558	46509	46509	he	114	" that 's Litany Lane . There are sixteen houses in it , and they 're all mine . Half way down , on the left , runs off Elm Court , where there are fourteen houses , and those are all mine , too . "
47042	47054	47056	47057	the landlord	1422	" If you do n't like the room , clear out , "
47282	47298	47300	47301	Mr. Woodstock	114	" That 's the most infernal little devil in all London , I do believe , "
47311	47353	47300	47301	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Her mother owes two weeks , and if she do n't pay something to - day , I 'll have her out . She 'll be shamming illness , you 'll see . The child ran up to prepare her . "
47421	47428	47430	47430	Abraham	115	" Ha , I thought so , "
47435	47445	47430	47430	Abraham	115	" Are you going to pay anything this week ? "
47453	47460	47462	47463	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Have you got the rent ? "
47478	47485	47462	47463	Mr. Woodstock	114	" No , we ai n't , "
47509	47559	47560	47560	They	1441	" Then out you go ! Come , you , get up now ; d ' you hear ? Very well ; come along , Waymark ; you take hold of that foot , and I 'll take this . Now , drag her out on to the landing . "
47932	47937	47939	47940	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Rent , Slimy , "
48102	48109	48111	48112	Mr. Woodstock	114	" How 's trade , Slimy ? "
48114	48121	48123	48124	the man	491	" Which trade , Mr. Woodstock ? "
48134	48141	48123	48124	the man	491	" Oh , trade in general . "
48142	48153	48155	48155	Slimy	156	" There never was sich times since old Scratch died , "
48161	48169	48158	48158	his	156	" No chance for a honest man . "
48170	48186	48123	48124	the man	491	" Then you 're in luck . This is the new collector , d'you see . "
48187	48197	48199	48199	Slimy	156	" I 've been a - looking at him , "
48221	48236	48199	48199	Slimy	156	" I seen him somewheres , but I ca n't just make out where . "
48237	48249	48251	48251	Abraham	115	" Not many people you have n't seen , I think , "
48684	48690	48691	48691	he	118	" Whatever success I have , "
48696	48702	48691	48691	he	118	" you will share it . "
48703	48709	48710	48710	she	99	" If I thought so ! "
49108	49117	49118	49118	she	316	" Do come up and look at it , "
49121	49155	49118	49118	she	316	" there 's no one in the house . I want to ask you if you can find a better place for it . It does n't show so well where it is . "
49352	49400	49343	49343	she	3216	" Oh , Miss Smales , I did n't know as you was n't alone ! I heard you moving about , and come just to arst you to lend me but never mind , I 'm so sorry ; why did n't you lock the door ? "
49433	49442	49443	49443	she	99	" I never thought any one was in , "
49447	49476	49443	49443	she	99	" It 's Miss Mould , the lodger . She went out before I did , and I never heard her come back . Whatever will she think ! "
49477	49482	49483	49483	he	911	" But of course , "
49486	49504	49483	49483	he	911	" you will explain everything to her . She knows who I am , does n't she ? "
49505	49518	49443	49443	she	99	" I do n't think so , and , even if she did "
49544	49557	49559	49559	Julian	118	" But surely , surely there is no need to trouble yourself , "
49576	49619	49559	49559	Julian	118	" I will speak to the woman myself , and clear you of every . Oh , but this is all nonsense . Let us go down at once , Harriet . What a pity you asked me to come up here ! "
49672	49681	49682	49682	Harriet	99	" Go as quietly as ever you can , "
49685	49695	49682	49682	Harriet	99	" The stairs creak so . Step very softly . "
49800	49807	49809	49809	Harriet	99	" You must n't go yet , "
49811	49845	49809	49809	Harriet	99	" I 'm sure that woman 's listening on the stairs . You must talk a little . Let 's talk so she can hear us . Suppose she should tell Mrs. Ogle . "
49846	49855	49857	49857	Julian	118	" I ca n't see that it matters , "
49862	49870	49857	49857	Julian	118	" I will myself see Mrs. Ogle . "
49871	49907	49809	49809	Harriet	99	" No , no ! The idea ! I should have to leave at once . Whatever shall I do if she turns me away , and wo n't give me a reference or anything ! "
50083	50087	50089	50089	Harriet	99	" But she knows "
50099	50105	50107	50108	her cousin	911	" What does she know ? "
50666	50677	50679	50680	the girl	316	" If you only knew what they 've been told ! "
50687	50744	50679	50680	the girl	316	" They would n't listen to a word you said . As if I could have thought of such a thing happening , and that woman to say all the bad things of us she can turn her tongue to ! I sha'n't never get another place ; I 'm thrown out on the wide world ! "
50802	50805	50806	50806	he	118	" But , "
50816	50844	50806	50806	he	118	" it is impossible that you should suffer all this through me , and I not even make an attempt to clear you of such vile charges ! "
50845	50883	50884	50884	He	118	" It was my own fault . I was thoughtless . I ought to have known that people 's always ready to think harm . But I think of nothing when I 'm with you , Julian ! "
50926	50941	50942	50942	she	316	" Oh , if you only felt to me like I do to you ! "
51081	51088	51089	51089	he	118	" Be my wife , then , "
51096	51110	51089	51089	he	118	" and let me guard you from all who would do you harm . "
51615	51623	51625	51625	Sally	105	" She was obliged to go out , "
51635	51656	51625	51625	Sally	105	" She wo n't be long , and she said you was to make yourself comfortable till she came back . "
51680	51701	51702	51702	she	105	" I was to ask you to smoke , and whether you 'd like a cup of coffee with it ? "
51716	51725	51726	51726	she	105	" The kettle 's boiling on the side , "
51734	51743	51731	51731	Waymark	129	" I can make it in a minute . "
51744	51752	51726	51726	she	105	" In that case , I will . "
51753	51764	51731	51731	Waymark	129	" You do n't mind me having one as well ? "
51765	51770	51726	51726	she	105	" Of course not . "
51771	51792	51793	51793	she	105	" Shall I talk , or shall I keep quiet ? I 'm not a servant here , you know , "
51806	51822	51793	51793	she	105	" Ida and me 's friends , and she 'd do just as much for I. "
51823	51829	51836	51836	he	129	" Talk by all means , "
51941	51953	51954	51954	she	105	" And how much do you think I earn a week ? "
51957	51966	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Fifteen shillings or so , I suppose ? "
51967	51996	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Ah , that 's all you know about it ! Now , last week was the best I 've had yet , and I made seven shillings . "
51997	52003	52300	52300	Ida	101	" What do you do ? "
52004	52031	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Machine work ; makin ' ulsters . How much do you think we get , now , for makin ' a ulster one like this ? "
52041	52046	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Have no idea . "
52047	52055	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Well , fourpence : there now ! "
52056	52067	52300	52300	Ida	101	" And how many can you make in a day ? "
52068	52103	52300	52300	Ida	101	" I ca n't make no more than two . Some make three , but it 's blessed hard work . But I get a little job now and then to do at home . "
52104	52116	52300	52300	Ida	101	" But you ca n't live on seven shillings a week ? "
52117	52139	52300	52300	Ida	101	" I sh'd think not , indeed . We have to make up the rest as best we can , s'nough . "
52140	52148	52300	52300	Ida	101	" But your employers must know that ? "
52149	52237	52300	52300	Ida	101	" In course . What 's the odds ? All us girls are the same ; we have to keep on the two jobs at the same time . But I 'll give up the day - work before long , s'nough . I come home at night that tired out I ai n't fit for nothing . I feel all eyes , as the sayin ' is . And it 's hard to have to go out into the Strand , when you 're like that . "
52238	52249	52300	52300	Ida	101	" But do they know about all this at home ? "
52250	52293	52300	52300	Ida	101	" No fear ! If our father knew , he 'd be down here precious soon , and the house would n't hold him . But I shall go back some day , when I 've got a good fit - out . "
52304	52318	52300	52300	Ida	101	" Well , young people , so you are making yourselves at home . "
52360	52391	52342	52342	Waymark	129	" You did n't mind waiting a little for me ? I really could n't help it . And then , after all , I thought you might n't come . "
52392	52398	52436	52436	she	316	" But I promised to . "
52399	52407	52409	52409	Ida	101	" Promises , promises , oh dear ! "
52411	52421	52409	52409	Ida	101	" Sally , here 's an orange for you . "
52422	52428	52436	52436	she	316	" You are a duck ! "
52452	52460	52461	52461	Ida	101	" And so you 've really come , "
52475	52493	52436	52436	she	316	" You find it surprising ? To begin with , I have come to pay my debts . "
52494	52502	52503	52503	she	101	" Is there another cup of coffee ? "
52512	52523	52503	52503	she	101	" I 'm too tired to get up and see . "
52557	52561	52562	52562	she	101	" Mr. Waymark , "
52569	52602	52562	52562	she	101	" if you had had supper with a friend , and your friend had paid the bill , should you take out your purse and pay him back at your next meeting ? "
52603	52611	52687	52687	she	101	" It would depend entirely on circumstances . "
52612	52644	52562	52562	she	101	" Just so . Then the present circumstances do n't permit anything of the kind , and there 's an end of that matter . Light another cigar , will you ? "
52645	52653	52687	52687	she	101	" You do n't dislike the smoke ? "
52654	52664	52562	52562	she	101	" If I did , I should say so . "
52703	52715	52716	52716	she	101	" Could you let me have some more books to read ? "
52719	52733	52687	52687	she	101	" I have brought one , thinking you might be ready for it . "
52736	52740	52741	52741	She	101	" Jane Eyre . "
52748	52757	52758	52758	she	101	" I do n't know how it is , "
52761	52840	52758	52758	she	101	" I have grown so hungry for reading of late . Till just now I never cared for it . When I was a child and went to school , I did n't like my lessons . Still I learned a good deal , for a little girl , and it has stayed by me . And oh , it seems so long ago ! Never mind , perhaps I will tell you all about that some day . "
52879	52887	52888	52888	he	129	" I shall think much of you , "
52891	52897	52899	52899	Ida	101	" The less the better , "
53717	53815	53713	53713	he	129	" DEAR MR . WAYMARK , I have an hour of freedom this Sunday afternoon , and I will spend it in replying as well as I can to your very interesting letter . My life is , as you say , very quiet and commonplace compared with that you find yourself suddenly entering upon . I have no such strange and moving things to write about , but I will tell you in the first place how I live and what I do , then put down some of the thoughts your letter has excited in me .
53816	53885	53713	53713	he	129	" The family I am with consists of very worthy but commonplace people . They treat me with more consideration than I imagine governesses usually get , and I am grateful to them for this , but their conversation , especially that of Mrs. Epping , I find rather wearisome . It deals with very trivial concerns of everyday life , in which I vainly endeavour to interest myself .
53886	54002	53713	53713	he	129	" Then there is the religious formalism of the Eppings and their friends . They are High Church . They discuss with astonishing vigour and at dreadful length what seems to me the most immaterial points in the Church service , and just at present an impulse is given to their zeal by the fact of their favourite clergyman being threatened with a prosecution for ritualistic practices . Of course I have to feign a becoming interest in all this , and to take part in all their religious forms and ceremonies . And indeed it is all so new to me that I have scarcely yet got over the first feelings of wonder and curiosity .
54003	54187	53713	53713	he	129	" Have I not , then , you will ask , the courage of my opinions ? But indeed my religious opinions are so strangely different from those which prevail here , that I fear it would be impossible to make my thoughts clear to these good people . They would scarcely esteem me a Christian ; and yet I can not but think that it is they who are widely astray from Christian belief and practice . The other evening the clergyman dined with us , and throughout the meal discussions of the rubric alternated with talk about delicacies of the table ! That the rubric should be so interesting amazes me , but that an earnest Christian should think it compatible with his religion to show the slightest concern in what he shall eat or drink is unspeakably strange to me . Surely , if Christianity means anything it means asceticism . My experience of the world is so slight . I believe this is the first clergyman I ever met in private life . Surely they can not all be thus ?
54188	54480	53713	53713	he	129	" I knew well how far the world at large had passed from true Christianity ; that has been impressed upon me from my childhood . But how strange it seems to me to hear proposed as a remedy the formalism to which my friends here pin their faith ! How often have I burned to speak up among them , and ask ' What think ye , then , of Christ ? Is He , or is He not , our exemplar ? Was not His life meant to exhibit to us the ideal of the completest severance from the world which is consistent with human existence ? To follow Him , should we not , at least in the spirit , cast off everything which may tempt us to consider life , as life , precious ? ' We can not worship both God and the world , and yet nowadays Christians seem to make a merit of doing so . When I conceive a religious revival , my thought does not in the least concern itself with forms and ceremonies . I imagine another John the Baptist inciting the people , with irresistible fervour , to turn from their sins that is , from the world and all its concerns and to purify themselves by Renunciation . What they call ' Progress , ' I take to be the veritable Kingdom of Antichrist . The world is evil , life is evil ; only by renunciation of the very desire for life can we fulfil the Christian idea . What then of the civilisation which endeavours to make the world more and more pleasant as a dwelling - place , life more and more desirable for its own sake ?
54481	54723	53713	53713	he	129	" And so I come to the contents of your own letter . You say you marvel that these wretched people you visited do not , in a wild burst of insurrection , overthrow all social order , and seize for themselves a fair share of the world 's goods . I marvel also ; all the more that their very teachers in religion seem to lay such stress on the joys of life . And yet what profit would a real Christian preacher draw for them from this very misery of their existence ! He would teach them that herein lay their supreme blessing , not their curse ; that in their poverty and nakedness lay means of grace and salvation such as the rich can scarcely by any means attain to ; that they should proudly , devoutly , accept their heritage of woe , and daily thank God for depriving them of all that can make life dear . Only awaken the spirit in these poor creatures , and how near might they be to the true Kingdom of Heaven ! And surely such a preacher will yet arise , and there will be a Reformation very different from the movement we now call by that name . But I weary you , perhaps . It may be you have no interest in all this . Yet I think you would wish me to write from what I am .
54724	54746	53713	53713	he	129	" It would interest me to hear your further experiences in the new work . Believe me to be your sincere friend ,
54747	54751	53713	53713	he	129	" MAUD ENDERBY . "
54820	54895	54813	54813	Julian	118	" This will be the beginning of a new life for me . Already I have felt a growth in my power of poetical production . Verse runs together in my thoughts without effort ; I feel ready for some really great attempt . Have you not noticed something of this in me these last few days ? Come and see me to - night , if you can , and rejoice with me . "
55227	55236	55237	55237	Waymark	130	" I am grievously impatient of domestic arrangements , "
55240	55331	55237	55237	Waymark	130	" I fancy it would never do for me to marry , unless I had limitless cash , and my wife were as great a Bohemian as myself . By the by , I have another letter from Maud . Her pessimism is magnificent . This intense religiousness is no doubt a mere phase ; it will pass , of course ; I wonder how things would arrange themselves if she came back to London . Why should n't she come here to sit and chat , like you do ? "
55332	55341	55343	55343	Casti	118	" That would naturally lead to something definite , "
55347	55501	55237	55237	Waymark	130	" Oh , I do n't know . Why should it ? I 'm a believer in friendship between men and women . Of course there is in it the spice of the difference of sex , and why not accept that as a pleasant thing ? How much better if , when we met a woman we liked , we could say frankly , ' Now let us amuse each other without any arriere pensee . If I married you to - day , even though I feel quite ready to , I should ten to one see some one next week who would make me regret having bound myself . So would you , my dear . Very well , let us tantalise each other agreeably , and be at ease in the sense that we are on the right side of the illusion . ' You laugh at the idea ? "
55515	55526	55528	55528	Waymark	130	" I 'm making an article out of Elm Court , "
55530	55806	55528	55528	Waymark	130	" Semi - descriptive , semi - reflective , wholly cynical Maybe it will pay for my summer holiday . And , apropos of the same subject , I 've got great ideas . This introduction to such phases of life will prove endlessly advantageous to me , artistically speaking . Let me get a little more experience , and I will write a novel such as no one has yet ventured to write , at all events in England . I begin to see my way to magnificent effects ; ye gods , such light and shade ! The fact is , the novel of every - day life is getting worn out . We must dig deeper , get to untouched social strata . Dickens felt this , but he had not the courage to face his subjects ; his monthly numbers had to lie on the family tea - table . Not virginibus puerisque will be my book , I assure you , but for men and women who like to look beneath the surface , and who understand that only as artistic material has human life any significance . Yes , that is the conclusion I am working round to . The artist is the only sane man . Life for its own sake ? no ; I would drink a pint of laudanum to - night . But life as the source of splendid pictures , inexhaustible material for effects that can reconcile me to existence , and that only . It is a delight followed by no bitter after - taste , and the only such delight I know . "
55850	55858	55860	55860	Julian	118	" Waymark thinks I 'm neglecting him , "
55872	55888	55890	55890	Harriet	99	" It 's better to neglect him than to neglect me , I should think , "
55907	55922	55925	55925	Julian	118	" But could n't we find out some way of doing neither , dear ? "
55932	55965	55925	55925	Julian	118	" Now suppose I give him a couple of hours one evening every week ? You could spare that , could n't you ? Say , from eight to ten on Wednesdays ? "
55966	55977	55979	55979	Harriet	99	" I suppose you 'll go if you want to . "
55997	56019	56021	56021	Julian	118	" Come , come , we wo n't say any more about it , if it 's so disagreeable to you , "
56036	56070	56021	56021	Julian	118	" You do n't feel well to - day , do you ? I ought n't to have left you this afternoon , but it was difficult to refuse , was n't it ? "
56071	56091	56092	56092	Waymark	130	" He had no business to ask you to go . He could see I did n't like it . "
56289	56305	56311	56311	her	101	" I have no spare time in the week . I thought you would understand this .
56308	56308	56306	56306	I.	1605	"
56381	56414	56415	56415	I.	1605	" Sally and I are going up the river to - morrow , if it is fine . Do you care to meet us on the boat which reaches Chelsea Pier at 10.30 ?
56417	56417	56415	56415	I.	1605	"
56500	56504	56497	56497	Ida	101	" Good morning ; "
56617	56622	56623	56623	Waymark	130	" By the by , "
56636	56659	56623	56623	Waymark	130	" you did n't tell me where you were going ; so I took no ticket , and left matters to fate . "
56660	56667	56668	56668	Ida	101	" Are you a good walker ? "
56671	56679	56623	56623	Waymark	130	" Fairly good , I flatter myself . "
56680	56747	56623	56623	Waymark	130	" Then this is what I propose . It 's a plan I carried out two or three times by myself last summer , and enjoyed . We get off at Putney , walk through Roehampton , then over the park into Richmond . By that time we shall be ready for dinner , and I know a place where we can have it in comfort . "
57106	57110	57120	57120	Waymark	130	" Star and Garter "
57150	57158	57159	57159	she	101	" You are to go straight in , "
57169	57221	57159	57159	she	101	" and are to tell the first person you meet that three people want dinner . There 's no choice roast beef and vegetables , and some pudding or other afterwards . Then you are to walk straight upstairs , as if you knew your way , and we will follow . "
57333	57341	57342	57342	she	101	" He 's like poor old Grim , "
57351	57371	57342	57342	she	101	" If you are good , you may bring out a chair and smoke a cigar here after dinner . "
57388	57392	57394	57394	Sally	105	" Oh bother ! "
57396	57409	57394	57394	Sally	105	" There 's some one else a - comin ' , s'nough . "
57536	57545	57547	57548	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Hollo , Waymark , is it you ? "
57560	57574	57547	57548	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Sure , and they told us we 'd find a gentleman here . "
57575	57592	57615	57615	Waymark	130	" And I was the last person you would have thought of as answering that description ? "
57593	57614	57547	57548	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Well , no , I did n't mean that . I meant there was no mention of the ladies . "
57639	57649	57547	57548	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Then let me introduce you to the ladies . "
57730	57743	57744	57744	he	142	" Now , who 'd have thought of the like of this . "
57747	57777	57744	57744	he	142	" And we came in here by the merest chance ; sure , there 's a fatality in these things . We 've walked all the way from Hammersmith . "
57778	57784	57786	57786	Waymark	130	" And we from Putney , "
57788	57802	57744	57744	he	142	" You do n't mean it ? It 's been a warm undertaking . "
57803	57814	57744	57744	he	142	" How did you find the walk , Mr. Egger ? "
57815	57818	57820	57821	that gentleman	1645	" Bedad , "
57840	57856	57820	57821	that gentleman	1645	" I made my possible , but , bedad , I could not much more . "
57857	57863	57864	57864	Waymark	130	" You both look warm , "
57869	57885	57864	57864	Waymark	130	" I fear you hurried . You should have been leisurely , as we were . "
57886	57935	57820	57821	that gentleman	1645	" Now that 's cruel , Waymark . You need n't have reflected upon our solitariness . If we 'd been blessed with society such as you had , we 'd have come slow enough . As it was , we thought a good deal of our dinners . "
58010	58023	58025	58025	O'Gree	142	" Let us have one of your German songs , my boy , "
58027	58041	58043	58044	the Swiss	1013	" But it is the Sunday , and we arc still in England , "
58048	58054	58056	58056	Waymark	130	" Pooh , never mind , "
58058	58078	58056	58056	Waymark	130	" We 'll shut the door . Sing my favourite , Mr. Egger , ' Wenn 's Mailufterl . ' "
58292	58302	58304	58305	Mr. O'Gree	142	" How delightful it would be , Miss Fisher , "
58313	58339	58304	58305	Mr. O'Gree	142	" if this lucky chance happened again . If I only knew when you were coming again , there 's no telling but it might . "
58594	58600	58607	58607	he	114	" You smoke poor tobacco , "
58612	58620	58643	58643	him	129	" Good tobacco happens to be expensive , "
58625	58631	58643	58643	him	129	" Will you sit down ? "
58632	58638	58643	58643	him	129	" Yes , I will . "
58645	58659	58643	58643	him	129	" And so here you hang out , eh ? Only one room ? "
58660	58665	58643	58643	him	129	" As you see . "
58666	58674	58643	58643	him	129	" Devilish unhealthy , I should think . "
58675	58679	58643	58643	him	129	" But economical . "
58680	58683	58643	58643	him	129	" Ugh ! "
58846	58851	58852	58852	he	129	" You live alone ? "
58864	58868	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" At present . "
58869	58891	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Ha ! Did n't know but you might have found it lonely ; I used to , at your age . "
58898	58910	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" By - the - by , it 's your birthday . "
58911	58917	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" How do you know ? "
58918	58946	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Well , I should n't have done , but for an old letter I turned up by chance the other day . How old are you ? "
58947	58954	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Five - and - twenty . "
58955	58998	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" H'm . I am sixty - nine . You 'll be a wiser man when you get to my age . Well , if you can find room anywhere for that book there , perhaps you 'd like to keep it ! "
59005	59010	59011	59011	he	129	" A birthday present ! "
59014	59038	59011	59011	he	129	" It 's ten years since I had one . Upon my word , I do n't well know how to thank you ! "
59039	59050	59052	59052	Abraham	115	" Do you know what the thing was published at ? "
59060	59063	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" No . "
59064	59068	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Fifty pounds . "
59069	59101	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" I do n't care about the value . It 's the kindness . You could n't have given me anything , either , that would have delighted me so much . "
59102	59143	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" All right ; keep it , and there 's an end of the matter . And what do you do with yourself all day , eh ? I did n't think it very likely I should find you in . "
59144	59151	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" I 'm writing a novel . "
59152	59162	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" H'm . Shall you get anything for it ? "
59163	59172	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Ca n't say . I hope so . "
59173	59186	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Look here . Why do n't you go in for politics ? "
59187	59196	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Neither know nor care anything about them . "
59197	59206	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Would you like to go into Parliament ? "
59207	59223	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Would n't go if every borough in England called upon me to - morrow ? "
59224	59228	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Why not ? "
59229	59266	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Plainly , I think myself too good for such occupation . If you once succeed in getting outside the world , you have little desire to go back and join in its most foolish pranks . "
59267	59305	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" That 's all damned nonsense ! How can any one be too good to be in Parliament ? The better men you have there , the better the country will be governed , wo n't it ? "
59306	59370	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Certainly . But the best man , in this case , is the man who sees the shortest distance before his nose . If you think the world worth all the trouble it takes to govern it , go in for politics neck and crop , by all means , and the world will no doubt thank you in its own way . "
59382	59395	59396	59396	he	1670	" Then you think novel - writing better than governing the country ? "
59399	59408	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" On its own merits , vastly so . "
59409	59422	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" And suppose there was no government What about your novels then ? "
59423	59437	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" I 'd make a magnificent one out of the spectacle of chaos . "
59438	59449	59451	59451	Abraham	115	" But you know very well you 're talking bosh , "
59456	59578	59451	59451	Abraham	115	" There must be government , and there must be order , say what you like . Its nature that the strong should rule over the weak , and show them what 's for their own good . What else are we here for ? if you 're going to be a parson , well and good ; then cry down the world as much as you please , and think only about heaven and hell . But as far as I can make out , there 's government there too . The devil rebelled and was kicked out . Serve him right If he was n't strong enough to hold his own , he 'd ought to have kept quiet . "
59579	59588	59590	59590	Waymark	129	" You 're a Conservative , of course , "
59594	59610	59590	59590	Waymark	129	" You believe only in keeping the balance . You do n't are about reform . "
59611	59639	58999	58999	Waymark	129	" Do n't be so sure of that Let me have the chance and he power , and I 'd reform hard enough , many a thing . "
59640	59723	59590	59590	Waymark	129	" Well , one might begin on a small scale . Suppose one took in hand Litany Lane and Elm Court ? Suppose we exert our right as the stronger , and , to begin with , do a little whitewashing ? Then sundry stairs and ceilings might be looked to . No doubt there 'd be resistance , but on the whole it would be for the people 's own good . A little fresh draining might n't be amiss , or "
59724	59736	59738	59738	Abraham	115	" What the devil 's all this to do with politics ? "
59746	59755	59757	59757	Waymark	129	" I should imagine , a good deal , "
59764	59779	59757	59757	Waymark	129	" If you 're for government , yen must n't be above considering details . "
59780	59923	59590	59590	Waymark	129	" And so you think you have a hit at me , eh ? Nothing of the kind . These are affairs of private contract , and no concern of government at all . In private contract a man has only a right to what he 's strong enough to exact If a tenant tells me my houses ai n't fit to live in , I tell him to go where he 'll be better off ' and I do n't hinder him ; I know well enough in a day or two there 'll come somebody else . Ten to one he ca n't go , and he do n't . Then why should I be at unnecessary expense in making the places better ? As Boon as I can get no tenants I 'll do so ; not till then . "
59924	59935	59757	59757	Waymark	129	" You do n't believe in works of mere humanity ? "
59936	59948	59950	59950	Abraham	115	" What the devil 's humanity got to do with business ? "
59952	59955	59957	59957	Waymark	129	" True , "
59961	59974	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" See , we wo n't talk of these kind of things , "
59979	60006	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" That 's just what we always used to quarrel about , and I 'm getting too old for quarrelling . Got any engagement this afternoon ? "
60007	60021	59757	59757	Waymark	129	" I thought of looking in to see a friend here in the street "
60022	60027	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Male or female ? "
60028	60035	59757	59757	Waymark	129	" Both ; man and wife . "
60036	60131	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Oh , then you have got some friends ? So had I when I was your age . They go somehow when you get old . Your father was the last of them , I think . But you 're not much like him , except a little in face . True , he was a Radical , but you , well , I do n't know what you are . If you 'd been a son of mine , I 'd have had you ill Parliament by now , somehow or other . "
60132	60141	60143	60144	Way mark	196	" I think you never had a son ? "
60165	60168	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" No . "
60169	60179	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" But you had some children , I think ? "
60180	60189	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Yes , yes , they 're dead . "
60207	60233	59976	59977	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Never mind the friend to - day ; come and have some dinner with me . I seem to want a bit of company . "
60256	60264	60265	60266	Mr. Woodstock	114	" It 's a pleasant part this , "
60276	60290	60265	60266	Mr. Woodstock	114	" One might build himself a decent house somewhere about here , eh ? "
60291	60299	60265	60266	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Do you think of doing so ? "
60300	60322	60265	60266	Mr. Woodstock	114	" I think of doing so ! What 's the good of a house , and nobody to live in it ? "
60663	60684	60653	60653	her	105	" Oh , I thought it was you ! You wo n't see I no more at the old place . "
60685	60692	60785	60785	he	449	" No ? How 's that ? "
60693	60729	60653	60653	her	105	" I 'm leavin ' un to - morrow . I 've got a place in a shop , just by here , a chandler 's shop , and I 'm going to live in . "
60730	60751	60785	60785	he	449	" Indeed ? Well , I 'm glad to hear it . I dare say you 'll be better off . "
60752	60763	60653	60653	her	105	" Oh , I say , you know your friend ? "
60764	60768	60785	60785	he	449	" The Irishman ? "
60769	60772	60653	60653	her	105	" Yes . "
60773	60778	60785	60785	he	449	" What about him ? "
60794	60797	60799	60799	Sally	105	" Well , "
60801	60833	60799	60799	Sally	105	" I do n't mind you telling un where I live now , if you like . Look , there 's the address on that paper ; you can take it . "
60834	60852	60653	60653	her	105	" Oh , I see . In point of fact , you wish me to tell him ? "
60853	60879	60799	60799	Sally	105	" Oh , I do n't care . I dessay he do n't want to know anything about I. But you can if you like . "
60880	60911	60653	60653	her	105	" I will be sure to , and no doubt he will be delighted . He 's been growing thin since I told him you declined to renew his acquaintance . "
60912	60938	60799	60799	Sally	105	" Oh , do n't talk ! And now I must be off . Good - bye . I dessay I shall see you sometimes ? "
60939	60956	60653	60653	her	105	" Without doubt . We 'll have another Sunday at Richmond soon . Good - bye . "
60987	60998	60970	60970	she	105	" I 've got it ! I 've got it ! "
61032	61040	61041	61041	Sally	105	" They said they liked my appearance , "
61045	61099	61041	61041	Sally	105	" and ' ud give me a try . I go in to - morrow . It wo n't be a over easy place , neither . I 've to do all the cleaning in the house , and there 's a baby to look after when I 'm not in the shop . "
61100	61108	61041	61041	Sally	105	" And what will they give you ? "
61109	61125	61041	61041	Sally	105	" Ten shillings a month for the first half - year ; then a rise . "
61126	61132	61041	61041	Sally	105	" And you 're satisfied ? "
61133	61161	61041	61041	Sally	105	" Oh , it 'll do till something better turns up . Oh , I say , I met your friend just after I 'd come away . "
61162	61166	61168	61168	Ida	101	" Did you ? "
61171	61191	61041	61041	Sally	105	" Yes ; and I told him he could tell his friend where I was , if he liked . "
61192	61196	61041	61041	Sally	105	" His friend ? "
61197	61204	61206	61206	Sally	105	" The Irishman , you know , "
61213	61224	61206	61206	Sally	105	" I told you he 'd been asking after me . "
61240	61243	61245	61245	her	101	" Ah ! "
61290	61298	61299	61299	Sally	105	" Are you engaged to - night ? "
61303	61312	61245	61245	her	101	" No ; will you sit with me ? "
61313	61327	61245	61245	her	101	" You 're not feeling very well to - day , are you ? "
61328	61333	61335	61335	Ida	101	" I think not , "
61344	61364	61335	61335	Ida	101	" I 've been thinking of going out of London for a few days , perhaps to the seaside . "
61365	61370	61372	61372	Sally	105	" Go to Weymouth ! "
61379	61462	61372	61372	Sally	105	" Go and see my people , and tell un how I 'm getting on . They 'll make you hide with un all the time you 're there , s'nough . It is n't a big house , but it 's comfortable , and see if our mother would n't look after you ! It 's three weeks since I wrote ; if I do n't mind there 'll be our father up here looking after I. Now , do go ! "
61463	61485	61534	61534	her	101	" No , it 's too far . Besides , if I go , I shall want to be quite alone . "
61539	61546	61547	61547	he	129	" Where should you go to ? "
61550	61585	61531	61531	he	129	" I think to Hastings . I went there once , when I was a child , with my mother I believe I told you . I had rather go there than anywhere else . "
61586	61596	61597	61597	he	129	" I feel the need of a change myself , "
61610	61633	61597	61597	he	129	" Suppose I were to go to Hastings , too at the same time that you 're there would you dislike it ? "
61663	61672	61673	61673	he	129	" But you would rather I did n't ? "
61676	61681	61634	61634	She	101	" No , indeed , "
61689	61701	61634	61634	She	101	" I should have company , if I found it dull . "
61702	61717	61730	61730	he	129	" Then let us go down by the same train will you , Ida ? "
61747	61752	61754	61754	her	101	" If you like , "
61762	61772	61774	61774	Waymark	129	" Why should n't life be always like this ? "
61881	61956	62356	62356	Ida	101	" Why should n't life be always like this ? It might be sunshine or fireside if men were wise . Leisure is the one thing that all desire , but they strive for it so blindly that they frustrate one another 's hope . And so at length they have come to lose the end in the means ; are mad enough to set the means before them as in itself an end . "
61957	61966	61968	61969	his companion	1325	" We must work to forget our troubles , "
61972	62161	61968	61969	his companion	1325	" Why , yes , and those very troubles are the fit reward of our folly . We have not been content to live in the simple happiness of our senses . We must be learned and wise , forsooth . We were not content to enjoy the beauty of the greater and the lesser light . We must understand whence they come and whither they go after that , what they are made of and how much they weigh . We thought for such a long time that our toil would end in something ; that we might become as gods , knowing good and evil . Now we are at the end of our tether , we see clearly enough that it has all been worse than vain ; how good if we could unlearn it all , scatter the building of phantasmal knowledge in which we dwell so uncomfortably ! It is too late . The gods never take back their gifts ; we wearied them with our prayers into granting us this one , and now they sit in the clouds and mock us . "
62173	62180	62181	62181	Waymark	129	" People kill themselves in despair , "
62185	62245	62181	62181	Waymark	129	" that is , when they have drunk to the very dregs the cup of life 's bitterness . If they were wise , they would die at that moment if it ever comes when joy seems supreme and stable . Life can give nothing further , and it has no more hellish misery than disillusion following upon delight . "
62246	62256	62257	62257	Ida	101	" Did you ever seriously think of killing yourself ? "
62265	62319	62181	62181	Waymark	129	" Yes . I have reached at times the point when I would not have moved a muscle to escape death , and from that it is not far to suicide . But my joy had never come , and it is hard to go away without that one draught . And you ! "
62320	62346	62181	62181	Waymark	129	" I went so far once as to buy poison . But neither had I tasted any happiness , and I could not help hoping . "
62347	62355	62181	62181	Waymark	129	" And you still wait still hope ? "
62388	62539	62379	62379	she	101	" When I was here last , I was seven years old . Now I am not quite nineteen . How long I have lived since then how long ! Yet my life did not really begin till I was about eleven . Till then I was a happy child , understanding nothing . Between then and now , if I have discovered little good either in myself or in others , I have learned by heart everything that is bad in the world . Nothing in meanness or vileness or wretchedness is a secret to me . Compare me with other girls of nineteen perhaps still at school . What sort of a companion should I be for one of those , I wonder ! What strange thoughts I should have , if ever I talked with such a girl ; how old I should feel myself beside her ! "
62540	62578	62579	62579	She	1703	" Your knowledge is better in my eyes than their ignorance . My ideal woman is the one who , knowing every darkest secret of life , keeps yet a pure mind as you do , Ida . "
62589	62598	62585	62585	Waymark	129	" Your mother died when you were eleven ! "
62599	62730	62585	62585	Waymark	129	" Yes , and that was when my life began . My mother was very poor , but she managed to send me to a pretty good school . But for that , my life would have been very different ; I should not have understood myself as well as I always have done . Poor mother , good , good mother ! Oh , if I could but have her now , and thank her for all her love , and give her but one year of quiet happiness . To think that I can see her as if she were standing before me , and yet that she is gone , is nowhere , never to be brought back to me if I break my heart with longing ! "
62834	62842	62843	62843	Waymark	129	" She 's happier than we are , "
62847	62856	62843	62843	Waymark	129	" Think how long she has been resting . "
62869	62895	62857	62857	Ida	101	" They took her to a hospital in her last illness , and she died there . I do n't know where her grave is . "
62896	62910	62843	62843	Waymark	129	" And what became of you ? Had you friends to go to ? "
62911	63176	62857	62857	Ida	101	" No one ; I was quite alone . We had been living in lodgings . The landlady told me that of course I could n't stay on there ; she could n't afford to keep me ; I must go and find a home somewhere . Try and think what that meant to me . I was so young and ignorant that such an idea as that I might one day have to earn my own living had never entered my mind . I was fed and clothed like every one else , a good deal better , indeed , than some of the children at school , and I did n't know why it should n't always be so . Besides , I was a vain child ; I thought myself clever ; I had even begun to look at myself in the glass and think I was handsome . It seemed quite natural that every one should be kind and indulgent to me . I shall never forget the feeling I had when the landlady spoke to me in that hard , sharp way . My whole idea of the world was overset all at once ; I seemed to be in a miserable dream . I sat in my mother 's bedroom hour after hour , and , every step I heard on the stairs , I thought it must be my mother coming back home to me ; it was impossible to believe that I was left alone , and could look to no one for help and comfort . "
63177	63548	62843	62843	Waymark	129	" Next morning the landlady came up to me again , and said , if I liked , she could tell me of a way of earning my living . It was by going as a servant to an eating - house in a street close by , where they wanted some one to wash up dishes and do different kinds of work not too hard for a child like me . I could only do as I was advised ; I went at once , and was engaged . They took off the dress I was wearing , which was far too good for me then , and gave me a dirty , ragged one ; then I was set to work at once to clean some knives . Nothing was said about wages or anything of that kind ; only I understood that I should live in the house , and have all given me that I needed . Of course I was very awkward . I tried my very hardest to do everything that was set me , but only got scolding for my pains ; and it soon came to boxes on the ear , and even kicks . The place was kept by a man and wife ; they had a daughter older than I , and they treated her just like a hired servant . I used to sleep with the girl in a wretched kitchen underground , and the poor thing kept me awake every night with crying and complaining of her hard life . It was no harder than mine , and I ca n't think she felt it more ; but I had even then a kind of stubborn pride which kept me from showing what I suffered . I could n't have borne to let them see what a terrible change it was for me , all this drudgery and unkindness ; I felt it would have been like taking them into my confidence , opening my heart to them , and I despised them too much for that . I even tried to talk in a rough rude way , as if I had never been used to anything better "
63549	63558	63561	63561	Waymark	129	" That was fine , that was heroic ! "
63564	63823	63824	63824	Jane	181	" I only know it was miserable enough . And things got worse instead of better . The master was a coarse drunken brute , and he and his wife used to quarrel fearfully . I have seen them throw knives at each other , and do worse things than that , too . The woman seemed somehow to have a spite against me from the first , and the way her husband behaved to me made her hate me still more . Child as I was , he did and said things which made her jealous . Often when she had gone out of an evening , I had to defend myself against him , and call the daughter to protect me . And so it went on , till , what with fear of him , and fear of her , and misery and weariness , I resolved to go away , become of me what might . One night , instead of undressing for bed as usual , I told Jane that was the daughter that I could n't bear it any longer , and was going away , as soon as I thought the house was quiet . She looked at me in astonishment , and asked me if I had anywhere to go to . Will you believe that I said yes , I had ? I suppose I spoke in a way which did n't encourage her to ask questions ; she only lay down on the bed and cried as usual . "
63826	63834	63824	63824	Jane	181	" I said , in a little , "
63847	63848	63849	63849	I	0	" "
63852	63860	63849	63849	I	0	" she cried out , starting up , "
63873	63968	63867	63867	We	1709	" It was my turn to ask her if she had anywhere to go to . She said she knew a girl who lived in a good home at Tottenham , and who 'd do something for her , she thought . At any rate she 'd rather go to the workhouse than stay where she was . So , about one o'clock , we both crept out by a back way , and ran into Edgware Road . There we said good - bye , and she went one way , and I another .
63969	64199	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" All that night I walked about , for fear of being noticed loitering by a policeman . When it was morning , I had come round to Hyde Park , and , though it was terribly cold just in March I went to sleep on a seat . I woke about ten o'clock , and walked off into the town , seeking a poor part , where I thought it more likely I might find something to do . Of course I asked first of all at eating - houses , but no one wanted me . It was nearly dark , and I had n't tasted anything . Then I begged of one or two people I forgot everything but my hunger and they gave me a few coppers . I bought some bread , and still wandered about . There are some streets into which I can never bear to go now ; the thought of walking about them eight years ago is too terrible to me . Well , I walked till midnight , and then could stand up no longer . I found myself in a dirty little street where the house doors stood open all night ; I went into one , and walked up as far as the first landing , and there fell down in a corner and slept all night . "
64200	64204	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" Poor child ! "
64231	64245	64246	64246	Ida	101	" I must have looked a terrible little savage on that next morning , "
64253	64450	64246	64246	Ida	101	" Oh , how hungry I was ! I was awoke by a woman who came out of one of the rooms , and I asked her if she 'd give me something to eat . She said she would , if I 'd light her fire for her , and clean up the grate . I did this , gladly enough . Then she pretended I had done it badly , and gave me one miserable little dry crust , and told me to be off . Well , that day I found another woman who said she 'd give me one meal and twopence a day for helping her to chop wood and wash vegetables ; she had a son who was a costermonger , and the stuff he sold had to be cleaned each day . I took the work gladly . She never asked me where I spent the night ; the truth was I chose a different house each night , where I found the door open , and went up and slept on the stairs . I often found several people doing the same thing , and no one disturbed us .
64451	65013	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" I lived so for a fortnight , then I was lucky enough to get into another eating - house . I lived there nearly two months , and had to leave for the very same reason as at the first place . I only half understood the meaning of what I had to resist , but my resistance led to other unbearable cruelties , and again I ran away . I went about eight o'clock in the evening . The thought of going back to my old sleeping places on the stairs was horrible . Besides , for some days a strange idea had been in my head . I had not forgotten my friend Jane , and I wondered whether , if I went to Tottenham , it would be possible to find her . Perhaps she might be well off there , and could help me . I had made inquiries about the way to Tottenham , and the distance , and when I left the eating - house I had made up my mind to walk straight there . I started from Hoxton , and went on and on , till I had left the big streets behind . I kept asking my way , but often went long distances in the wrong direction . I knew that Tottenham was quite in the country , and my idea was to find a sleeping - place in some field , then to begin my search on the next day . It was summer , but still I began to feel cold , and this drew me away out of my straight road to a fire which I saw burning a little way off . I thought it would be nice to sit down by it and rest . I found that the road was being mended , and by the fire lay a watchman in a big tub . Just as I came up he was eating his supper . He was a great , rough man , but I looked in his face and thought it seemed good , so I asked him if he 'd let me rest a little . Of course he was surprised at seeing me there , for it must have been midnight , and when he asked me about myself I told him the truth , because he spoke in a kind way . Then he stopped eating and gave me what was left ; it was a bit of fat bacon and some cold potatoes ; but how good it was , and how good he was ! To this moment I can see that man 's face . He got out of his tub and made me take his place , and he wrapped me up in something he had there . Then he sat by the fire , and kept looking at me , I thought , in a sad sort of way ; and he said , over and over again , ' Ay , it 's bad to be born a little girl ; it 's bad to be born a little girl ; pity you was n't a boy . ' Oh , how well I can hear his voice this moment ! And as he kept saying this , I went off to sleep . "
65023	65029	65031	65031	Waymark	129	" And in the morning ? "
65033	65131	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" Well , when I woke up , it was light , and there were a lot of other men about , beginning their work on the road . I crept out of the tub , and when they saw me , they laughed in a kind sort of way , and gave me some breakfast . I suppose I thanked them , I hope I did ; the watchman was gone , but no doubt he had told the others my story , for they showed me the way to Tottenham , and wished me luck . "
65132	65140	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" And you found your friend Jane ! "
65141	65264	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" No , no ; how was it likely I should ? I wandered about till I could stand no longer , and then I went up to the door of a house which stood in a garden , and begged for something to eat . The servant who opened was sending me away , when her mistress heard , and came to the door . She stood looking at me for some time , and then told me to come in . I went into the kitchen , and she asked me all about myself . I told her the truth ; I was too miserable now to do anything else . Well , the result was she kept me there . "
65265	65269	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" For good ? "
65270	65484	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" Indeed , for good . In that very house I lived for six years . Oh ; she was the queerest and kindest little body ! At first I helped her servant in the kitchen , she lived quite by herself , with one servant , but little by little she made me a sort of lady 's maid , and I did no more rough work . You would n't believe the ridiculous fancies of that dear old woman ! She thought herself a great beauty , and often told me so very plainly , and she used to talk to me about her chances of being married to this and the other person in the neighbourhood . And the result of all this was that she had to spend I do n't know how long every day in dressing herself , and then looking at herself in the glass . And I had to learn how to do her hair , and put paint and powder on her face , and all sorts of wonderful things . She was as good to me as she could be , and I never wanted for anything . And so six years passed , and one morning she was found dead in her bed .
65485	65561	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" Well , that was the end of the happiest time of my life . In a day or two some relatives came to look after things , and I had to go . They were kind to me , however ; they gave me money , and told me I might refer to them if I needed to . I came to London , and took a room , and wondered what I should do .
65562	65713	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" I advertised , and answered advertisements , but nothing came . My money was going , and I should soon be as badly off as ever . I began to do what I had always thought of as the very last thing , look for needlework , either for home or in a workroom . I do n't know how it is that I have always hated sewing . For one thing , I really ca n't sew . I was never taught as a child , and few girls are as clumsy with a needle as I am . I 've always looked upon a work - girl 's life as the most horrible drudgery ; I 'd far rather scrub floors . I suppose I 've a rebellious disposition , and just because sewing is looked upon as a woman 's natural slavery , I rebelled against it .
65714	65851	64206	64206	Waymark	129	" By this time I was actually starving . I had one day to tell my landlady I could n't pay my rent . She was a very decent woman , and she talked to me in a kind way . What was better , she gave me help . She had a sister who kept a laundry , and she thought I might perhaps get something to do there ; at all events she would go and see . The result was I got work . I was in the laundry nearly six months , and became quite clever in getting up linen . Now this was a kind of work I liked . You ca n't think what a pleasure it was to me to see shirts and collars turning out so spotless and sweet "
65855	65911	65852	65852	Waymark	129	" Oh , but you do n't understand . I do so like cleanliness ! I have a sort of feeling when I 'm washing anything , that I 'm really doing good in the world , and the dazzling white of linen after I 'd ironed it seemed to thank me for my work . "
65912	65922	65924	65924	Waymark	129	" Yes , yes , I understand well enough , "
65927	65995	65996	65996	She	1712	" For all that I could n't stay . I was restless . I had a foolish notion that I should like to be with a better kind of people again I mean people in a higher position . I still kept answering advertisements for a lady 's maid 's place , and at last I got what I wanted . Oh yes , I got it . "
66038	66054	66055	66055	she	1712	" Oh , I may as well tell you all , now I 've begun , "
66066	66093	66055	66055	she	1712	" You know what the end 's going to be ; never mind , at all events I 'll try and make you understand how it came .
66094	66550	66007	66007	Waymark	129	" The family I got into was a lady and her two grown - up daughters , and a son of about five - and - twenty . They lived in a small house at Shepherd 's Bush . My wages were very small , and I soon found out that they were a kind of people who keep up a great deal of show on very little means . Of course I had to be let into all the secrets of their miserable shifts for dressing well on next to nothing at all , and they expected me mother and daughters to do the most wonderful and impossible things . I had to turn old rags into smart new costumes , to trim worn - out hats into all manner of gaudy shapes , even to patch up boots in a way you could n't imagine . And they used to send me with money to buy things they were ashamed to go and buy themselves ; then , if I had n't laid out their few pence with marvellous result , they all but accused me of having used some of the money for myself . I had fortunately learnt a great deal with the old lady in Tottenham , or I could n't have satisfied them for a day . I 'm sure I did what few people could have done , and for all that they treated me from almost the first very badly . I had to be housemaid as well as lady 's maid ; the slavery left me every night worn out with exhaustion . And I had n't even enough to eat . As time went on , they treated me worse and worse . They spoke to me often in a way that made my heart boil , as if they were so many queens , and I was some poor mean wretch who was honoured by being allowed to toil for them . Then they quarrelled among themselves unceasingly , and of course I had to bear all the bad temper . I never saw people hate one another like those three did ; the sisters even scratched each other 's faces in their fits of jealousy , and sometimes they both stormed at their mother till she went into hysterics , just because she could n't give them more money . The only one in the house who ever spoke decently to me was the son Alfred Bolter , his name was . I suppose I felt grateful to him . Once or twice , when he met me on the stairs , he kissed me . I was too miserable even to resent it .
66551	66800	66055	66055	she	1712	" I went about , day after day , in a dazed state , trying to make up my mind to leave the people , but I could n't . I do n't know how it was , I had never felt so afraid of being thrown out into the world again . I suppose it was bodily weakness , want of proper food , and overwork . I began to feel that the whole world was wronging me . Was there never to be anything for me but slaving ? Was I never to have any enjoyment of life , like other people ? I felt a need of pleasure , I did n't care how or what . I was always in a fever ; everything was exaggerated to me . What was going to be my future ? I kept asking myself . Was it only to be hard work , miserably paid , till I died ? And I should die at last without having known what it was to enjoy my life . When I was allowed to go out it was very seldom I walked aimlessly about the streets , watching all the girls I passed , and fancying they all looked so happy , all enjoying their life so . I was growing thin and pale . I coughed , and began to think I was consumptive . A little more of it and I believe I should have become so really .
66801	66928	66007	66007	Waymark	129	" It came to an end , suddenly and unexpectedly . All three , mother and daughters , had been worrying me through a whole morning , and at last one of them called me a downright fool , and said I was n't worth the bread I ate . I turned on them . I ca n't remember a word I said , but speak I did , and in a way that astonished them ; they shrank back from me , looking pale and frightened . I felt in that moment that I was a thousand times their superior ; I believe I told them so . Then I rushed up to my room , packed my box , and went out into the street .
66929	67006	66055	66055	she	1712	" I had just turned a corner , when some one came up to me , and it was Mr. Bolter . He had followed me from the house . He laughed , said I had done quite right , and asked me if I had any money . I shook my head . He walked on by me , and talked . The end was , that he found me rooms , and provided for me .
67007	67088	66007	66007	Waymark	129	" I had not the least affection for him , but he had pleasant , gentlemanly ways , and it scarcely even occurred to me to refuse his offers . I was reckless ; what happened to me mattered little , as long as I had not to face hard work . I needed rest . For one in my position there was , I saw well enough , only one way of getting it . I took that way . "
67139	67161	67136	67136	she	101	" Do you remember , on the night when you first met me , a man following us in the street ? "
67165	67216	67136	67136	she	101	" He was a friend of Alfred Bolter 's , and sometimes we met him when we went to the theatre , and such places . That is the only person I ever hated from the first sight , hated and dreaded in a way I could not possibly explain . "
67217	67225	67227	67227	Waymark	129	" But why do you mention him ? "
67229	67235	67227	67227	Waymark	129	" What is his name ? "
67236	67242	67244	67244	Ida	101	" His name is Edwards , "
67257	67401	67244	67244	Ida	101	" I had been living in this way for nearly half - a - year , when one day this man called and came up to my sitting - room . He said he had an appointment with Mr. Bolter , who would come presently . I sat scarcely speaking , but he talked on . Presently , Mr. Bolter came . He seemed surprised to find the other man with me , and almost at once turned round and went out again . Edwards followed him , saying to me that he wondered what it all meant . The meaning was made clear to me a few hours after . There came a short note from Mr. Bolter , saying that he had suspected that something was wrong , and that under the circumstances he could of course only say good - bye .
67547	67547	67539	67539	I	0	"
67548	67555	67557	67557	Waymark	129	" How long ago was that ? "
67563	67567	67539	67539	I	0	" Four months . "
67595	67604	67605	67605	she	101	" Let us walk back on the sands , "
67610	67616	67568	67568	Ida	101	" You are going home ? "
67617	67640	67568	67568	Ida	101	" Yes , I want to rest a little . I will meet you again about eight o'clock , if you like . "
68544	68561	68648	68648	his	129	" Well , are you thinking how you can make a book out of my story ? "
68586	68596	68597	68597	he	129	" I must wait for the end of it , "
68611	68632	68648	68648	his	129	" The end ? Oh , you must invent one . Ends in real life are so commonplace and uninteresting . "
68633	68638	68640	68640	Waymark	129	" Commonplace or not , "
68651	68681	68640	68640	Waymark	129	" the end of your story should not be an unhappy one , if I had the disposing of it . And I might have but for one thing . "
68682	68687	68688	68688	she	101	" What 's that ? "
68695	68706	68720	68720	she	101	" My miserable poverty . If I only had money money "
68707	68710	68711	68711	she	101	" Money ! "
68744	68751	68720	68720	she	101	" I do n't understand you . "
68763	68805	68752	68752	He	129	" Look at that gold of the sunset in the pools the tide has left . It is the most glorious colour in nature , but it makes me miserable by reminding me of the metal it takes its name from . "
68945	68983	68931	68931	she	101	" I was going to tell you that I have just had news from London , which makes it necessary for me to go back to - morrow . I shall have to take an early train . "
68984	68993	68994	68994	Waymark	129	" This is because I have offended you , "
69002	69012	68994	68994	Waymark	129	" You had no thought of going before that . "
69013	69025	69027	69027	Ida	101	" I am not surprised that you refuse to believe me , "
69033	69054	69027	69027	Ida	101	" Still , it is the truth . And now I must go in again ; I am very tired . "
69055	69058	69059	69059	he	129	" No , "
69066	69098	69059	69059	he	129	" you must not go in till till you have forgotten me . At least come away to a quiet place , where I can speak freely to you ; these people "
69099	69105	69106	69106	she	101	" To - morrow morning , "
69114	69138	69106	69106	she	101	" I ca n't talk now and indeed there is no need to speak of this at all . I have forgotten it . "
69139	69163	69027	69027	Ida	101	" No , you have not ; how could you ? And you will not go to - morrow ; you shall not . "
69164	69170	69171	69171	she	101	" Yes , I must , "
69175	69183	69027	69027	Ida	101	" Then I shall go with you . "
69184	69201	69027	69027	Ida	101	" As you like . I shall leave by the express at five minutes past nine . "
69202	69221	69027	69027	Ida	101	" Then I shall be at the station . But at least I may walk home with you ? "
69222	69256	69027	69027	Ida	101	" No , please . If you wish me to think you are sincere , if you wish us still to be friends stay till I have left the pier . Good night . "
69998	70090	70091	70091	I.	1765	" I thought it better that I should go to London by an earlier train , for we should not have been quite at our ease with each other . I beg you will not think my leaving you is due to anything but necessity indeed it is not . I shall not be living at the old place , but any letter you send there I shall get . I can not promise to reply at once , but hope you will let me do so when I feel able to .
70093	70093	70091	70091	I.	1765	"
71101	71109	71111	71111	Paul	203	" We have talked it over again , "
71113	71123	71111	71111	Paul	203	" and we have decided to take this step . "
71144	71163	71124	71124	He	203	" And you still wish me to break it to Maud , and in the way you said ? "
71164	71250	71124	71124	He	203	" If you will . But I do so wish you would let me know your own thoughts about this . You have so much claim to be considered . Maud is in reality yours far more than she is ours . Will it do you think now it will really be for our own happiness ? Will the explanation you are able to give be satisfactory to her ? What will be her attitude towards us ? You know her character you understand her . "
71251	71267	71269	71270	Miss Bygrave	121	" If the future could be all as calm as the past year has been , "
71272	71283	71269	71270	Miss Bygrave	121	" I should have nothing to urge against your wishes . "
71284	71292	71294	71294	Enderby	204	" And this will contribute to it , "
71296	71307	71294	71294	Enderby	204	" This would give Emily the very support she needs . "
71330	71336	71337	71337	she	121	" Let it be so , "
71342	71377	71337	71337	she	121	" I myself have much hope from Maud 's influence . I will write and tell her not to renew her engagement , and she will be with us at the end of September . "
71378	71390	71395	71396	Miss Bygrave	121	" But you will not tell her anything till she comes ? "
71391	71394	71337	71337	she	121	" No . "
72399	72404	72394	72395	Mr. Enderby	205	" in the City . "
73618	73626	73603	73603	her	103	" Mother , I know that gentleman . "
73627	73631	73633	73634	Mrs. Enderby	204	" This one ? "
73662	73690	73643	73643	She	204	" Yes . If he should notice me , may I introduce him to you ? He was at the school where I taught a year ago . "
73691	73699	73701	73702	her mother	377	" Why , certainly , my love , "
73708	73734	73701	73702	her mother	377	" It is quite natural that you should have acquaintances I should like to know . Shall I ask him to come and see us ? "
75466	75493	75503	75503	Waymark	130	" Will you come and see me ? I am at home after eight o'clock till the end of the week , and all day on Sunday .
75496	75496	75494	75494	I.	130	"
76103	76109	76110	76110	she	101	" And who 's this ? "
76134	76147	76148	76148	she	101	" Does Grim remember who this is ? We still keep together , "
76155	76253	76148	76148	she	101	" All day long , whilst I 'm away , he keeps house ; I 'm often afraid he suffers dreadfully from loneliness , but , you see , I 'm obliged to lock him in . And he knows exactly the time when I come home . I always find him sitting on that chair by the door , waiting , waiting , oh so patiently ! And I often bring him back something nice , do n't I , Grimmy ? You should see how delighted he is as soon as I enter the door . "
76418	76429	76430	76430	she	101	" You 'll have a cup of tea with me ? "
76452	76475	76430	76430	she	101	" I only get home about eight o'clock , and this is the quietest and pleasantest meal in the day for me . "
76476	76486	76487	76487	Waymark	130	" What do you do all day , then ? "
76529	76534	76535	76535	she	101	" Do you guess ? "
76538	76553	76500	76500	She	101	" I believe I can . You have gone back to the laundry again ? "
76554	76557	76509	76509	her	101	" Yes . "
76558	76569	76500	76500	She	101	" And how long is it since you did so ? "
76570	76582	76509	76509	her	101	" How long is it since we last saw each other ? "
76583	76595	76500	76500	She	101	" Did you begin at once when you returned to London ? "
76596	76599	76509	76509	her	101	" Yes . "
76624	76634	76635	76635	Ida	101	" Do n't you think I 'm comfortable here ? "
76638	76664	76635	76635	Ida	101	" It 's like having a house of my own . I see nothing of the other people in the building , and feel independent . "
76665	76673	76739	76739	her	101	" Did you buy the furniture yourself ? "
76674	76728	76635	76635	Ida	101	" Yes ; just the things I could n't do without . I pay only three - and - sixpence a week , and so long as I can earn that , I 'm sure at all events of a home , where I can be happy or miserable , as I please . "
76839	76846	76847	76847	she	101	" Have you brought your pipe ? "
76857	76862	76823	76823	she	101	" May I smoke ? "
76863	76873	76903	76903	she	101	" Of course , just as you used to . "
76874	76882	76888	76888	himself	130	" But it is not the same , "
76890	76898	76899	76899	Ida	101	" Are you sorry for the change ? "
76911	76919	76903	76903	she	101	" What induced you to make it ? "
76920	76941	76903	76903	she	101	" Oh , I have strange fancies . The idea came , just like others do . Are you sorry ? "
76942	76956	76903	76903	she	101	" The opposite . Did the idea come whilst we were at Hastings ? "
76957	76978	76903	76903	she	101	" Before that . Do you remember my telling you that I had a letter calling me back to London ? "
76982	77002	76979	76979	Waymark	130	" It was from the laundry , to say I could go to work as soon as I liked . "
77003	77013	76903	76903	she	101	" And why did n't you tell me that ? "
77038	77049	77022	77022	her	101	" Did you think you would ever hear from me ? "
77050	77057	77022	77022	her	101	" I had given up hope . "
77058	77069	77022	77022	her	101	" And did you wonder what had become of me ? "
77070	77080	77022	77022	her	101	" Often . Why did n't you write before ? "
77081	77087	77022	77022	her	101	" I was n't ready . "
77088	77094	77095	77095	Waymark	130	" What does that mean ? "
77103	77124	77022	77022	her	101	" Perhaps I shall be able to explain some day . If not , well , it wo n't matter . "
77125	77135	77137	77137	Waymark	130	" And will you let me see you often ? "
77144	77158	77137	77137	Waymark	130	" Are we to be friends again , as we used to be ? "
77159	77167	77022	77022	her	101	" If you would care for it . "
77176	77184	77185	77185	he	130	" Certainly I should care for it , "
77231	77239	77240	77240	he	130	" Shall I bring you books again ? "
77243	77252	77254	77254	Ida	101	" I have very little time for reading , "
77258	77270	77254	77254	Ida	101	" It 's better , perhaps , that it is so . "
77271	77275	77205	77205	she	101	" But why ? "
77276	77298	77254	77254	Ida	101	" Perhaps it would make me discontented with my work , and want all sorts of things I could n't have . "
77299	77306	77307	77307	Waymark	130	" You have your Sundays free ? "
77316	77319	77307	77307	Waymark	130	" Yes . "
77320	77347	77254	77254	Ida	101	" Then we must have some expeditions again , now that the fine days have come . By the by , do you ever see Sally ? "
77357	77363	77348	77348	Ida	101	" Yes ; do you ? "
77364	77373	77254	77254	Ida	101	" No ; but I hear of her . "
77374	77379	77348	77348	Ida	101	" From your friend ? "
77380	77386	77254	77254	Ida	101	" Yes , from O'Gree . "
77387	77397	77398	77398	Ida	101	" Do your other friends still live near you ? "
77415	77422	77254	77254	Ida	101	" The Castis ? Oh yes . "
77423	77430	77431	77431	she	101	" What is Mrs. Casti like ? "
77443	77446	77447	77447	he	130	" Well , "
77450	77486	77447	77447	he	130	" it 's difficult to describe her . There 's nothing very good about her , and I suppose nothing very bad . I see little of her now ; she 's almost always ill . "
77487	77495	77254	77254	Ida	101	" What 's the matter with her ? "
77496	77510	77447	77447	he	130	" Ca n't say ; general weakness and ill health , I think ? "
77511	77531	77254	77254	Ida	101	" But she 's so young , is n't she ? Has she friends to go and see her ? "
77532	77539	77447	77447	he	130	" Very few , I think . "
77540	77550	77552	77552	Ida	101	" It must be dreadful to be like that , "
77554	77583	77552	77552	Ida	101	" I 'm thankful that I have my health , at all events . Loneliness is n't so hard to bear , as it must be in illness . "
77584	77590	77447	77447	he	130	" Do you feel lonely ? "
77591	77597	77599	77599	Ida	101	" A little , sometimes , "
77601	77614	77599	77599	Ida	101	" But it 's ungrateful to poor old Grim to say so . "
77615	77627	77447	77447	he	130	" Have you no acquaintances except the people you work with ? "
77633	77696	77628	77628	She	101	" And you do n't read ? Would n't you like to go on reading as you used to ? You have a better head than most women , and it 's a pity not to make use of it . That 's all nonsense about in making you discontented . You wo n't always be living like this , I suppose . "
77697	77701	77702	77702	Ida	101	" Why not ? "
77706	77709	77711	77711	Waymark	130	" Well , "
77718	77735	77711	77711	Waymark	130	" even if you do , it will be gain to you to cultivate your mind ? "
77736	77746	77628	77628	She	101	" Do you wish me to cultivate my mind ? "
77747	77753	77711	77711	Waymark	130	" You know I do . "
77766	77775	77776	77776	Ida	101	" I will do whatever you bid me , "
77779	77796	77776	77776	Ida	101	" I can get an hour or so each night , and I have all Sunday . "
77864	77872	77873	77873	he	130	" If it 's fine on Sunday , "
77876	77895	77873	77873	he	130	" will you go with me to Richmond , and let us have dinner at the old place ? "
77896	77899	77901	77901	Ida	101	" No , "
77909	77916	77901	77901	Ida	101	" I ca n't afford it . "
77917	77936	77873	77873	he	130	" But I invite you . Of course I did n't mean that it should be any expense . "
77943	77957	77873	77873	he	130	" No , I must take my own share , wherever we go . "
77958	77973	77975	77975	Waymark	130	" Then I shall certainly refuse your cup of tea next time I come , "
77978	77984	77986	77986	Ida	101	" That 's quite different , "
77988	78011	77986	77986	Ida	101	" But if you like , we can go in the afternoon , and walk about Roehampton ; that I can afford . "
78012	78024	78032	78032	She	101	" As you please . When shall I call for you ? "
78025	78031	77986	77986	Ida	101	" Half - past one . "
78123	78129	78131	78132	his friend	876	" How is your wife ? "
78143	78154	78109	78109	Waymark	210	" She said her headache was worse to - night . "
78155	78158	78160	78160	Waymark	210	" Curiously , "
78167	78178	78160	78160	Waymark	210	" it always is when you have to leave home . "
78193	78196	78197	78197	he	118	" Waymark , "
78210	78290	78197	78197	he	118	" I fear I have been behaving very foolishly . Many a time I have wished to speak out to you plainly , but a sort of delicacy a wrong kind of delicacy , I think prevented me . I ca n't keep this attitude any longer . I must tell you how things are going on , and you must give me what help you can . And perhaps I shall be telling you what you already know ? "
78291	78296	78160	78160	Waymark	210	" I have suspected . "
78297	78303	78304	78304	Julian	118	" Where is the blame ? "
78312	78874	78304	78304	Julian	118	" I can not think that ever husband was more patient and more indulgent than I have been . I have refused her nothing that my means could possibly obtain . I have given up all the old quiet habits of my life that she might n't think I slighted her ; I scarcely ever open a book at home , knowing that it irritates her to see me reading ; I do my best to amuse her at all times . How does she reward me ? For ever she grumbles that I ca n't perform impossibilities , take her to theatres , buy her new dresses , procure for her friends and acquaintances . My wishes , expressed or understood , weigh with her less than the least of her own caprices . She wantonly does things which she knows will cause me endless misery . Her companions are gross and depraved people , who constantly drag her lower and lower , to their own level . The landlady has told me that , in my absence , women have called to see her who certainly ought not to enter any decent house . When I entreat her to give up such associates , her only answer is to accuse me of selfishness , since I have friends myself , and yet wo n't permit her to have any . And things have gone from bad to worse . Several nights of late , when I have got home , she has been away , and has not returned till much after midnight . Hour after hour I have sat there in the extremest misery , waiting , waiting , feeling as though my brain would burst with its strain ! I have no idea where she goes to . If I ask , she only retorts by asking me where I spend the nights when I am with you , and laughs contemptuously when I tell her the truth . Her suspicions and jealousy are incessant , and torture me past endurance . Once or twice , I confess , I have lost patience , and have spoken angrily , too angrily ; then she has accused me of brutal disregard of her sufferings . It would hurt me less if she pierced me with a knife . Only this morning there was a terrible scene ; she maddened me past endurance by her wretched calumnies accusing me of I know not what disgraceful secrets and when words burst from me involuntarily , she fell into hysterics , and shrieked till all the people in the house ran up in alarm . Can you understand what this means to one of my temperament ? To have my private affairs forced upon strangers in this way tortures me with the pains of hell . I am naturally reticent and retiring too much so , I dare say and no misery could have been devised for me more dreadful than this . Her accusations are atrocious , such as could only come from a grossly impure mind , or at the suggestion of vile creatures . You she hates with a rabid hatred God only knows why . She would hate any one who was my friend , and whose society relieved me for a moment from my ghastly torments ! "
78892	78907	78886	78886	he	1956	" What am I to do , Waymark ? Can you give me advice ? "
78928	78942	78943	78943	he	1956	" You could n't well ask for advice in a more difficult case , "
78948	78977	78943	78943	he	1956	" There 's nothing for it but to strengthen yourself and endure . Force yourself into work . Try to forget her when she is out of sight . "
78978	78981	78984	78984	Julian	118	" But , "
78986	79284	78984	78984	Julian	118	" this amounts to a sentence of death ! What of the life before me , of the years I shall have to spend with her ? Work , forget myself , forget her , that is just what I can not do ! My nerves are getting weaker every day ; I am beginning to have fits of trembling and horrible palpitation ; my dreams are hideous with vague apprehensions , only to be realised when I wake . Work ! Half my misery is caused by the thought that my work is at an end for ever . It is all forsaking me , the delight of imagining great things , what power I had of putting my fancies into words , the music that used to go with me through the day 's work . It is long since I wrote a line of verse . Quietness , peace , a calm life of thought , these things are what I must have ; I thought I should have them in a higher degree than ever , and I find they are irretrievably lost . I feel my own weakness , as I never could before . When you bid me strengthen myself , you tell me to alter my character . The resolution needed to preserve the better part of my nature through such a life as this , will never be within my reach . It is fearful to think of what I shall become as time goes on . I dread myself ! There have been revealed to me depths of passion and misery in my own heart which I had not suspected . I shall lose all self - control , and become as selfish and heedless as she is . "
79285	79292	79294	79294	Waymark	210	" No , you will not , "
79297	79413	79294	79294	Waymark	210	" This crisis will pass over , and strength will be developed . We have a wonderful faculty for accommodating ourselves to wretchedness ; how else would the world have held together so long ? When you begin to find your voice again , maybe you wo n't sing of the dead world any longer , but of the living and suffering . Your thoughts were fine ; they showed you to be a poet ; but I have never hidden from you how I wished that you had been on my side . Art , nowadays , must be the mouthpiece of misery , for misery is the key - note of modern life . "
79433	79439	79440	79440	he	118	" One of her reproaches , "
79443	79523	79440	79440	he	118	" is just ; I ca n't meet it . If I object to her present companions it is my duty to find her more suitable ones . She lives too much alone . No doubt it is every husband 's duty to provide his wife with society . But how am I to find it ? I am so isolated , and always have been . I know not a soul who could be a friend to her . "
79532	79538	79539	79539	he	118	" One person I know , "
79549	79556	79539	79539	he	118	" who might perhaps help you . "
79557	79561	79563	79563	Julian	118	" You do ? "
79566	79841	79539	79539	he	118	" You know that I make all sorts of queer acquaintances in my wanderings . Well , I happen to know a girl of about your wife 's age , who , if she were willing , would be just the person you want . She is quite alone , parentless , and almost without friends . She lives by herself , and supports herself by working in a laundry . For all this , she is by no means the ordinary London work - girl ; you ca n't call her educated , but she speaks purely , and has a remarkably good intelligence . I met her by chance , and kept up her acquaintance . There has been nothing wrong bah ! how conventional one is , in spite of oneself ! I mean to say there has been nothing more than a pleasant friendship between us ; absolutely nothing . We see each other from time to time , and have a walk , perhaps a meal , together , and I lend her books . Now , do you think there would be any way of getting your wife to accept her society , say of an evening now and then ? Do n't do anything rash ; it is of course clear that you must have no hand in this . I must manage it if it is to be done . Naturally , I ca n't answer at once for the girl 's readiness ; but I believe she would do what I asked her to . Do you think it is worth entertaining , this idea ? "
79842	79857	79539	79539	he	118	" I do , indeed ; it would be salvation , I really believe . "
79858	79931	79539	79539	he	118	" Do n't be too sanguine , Casti ; that 's another of your faults . Still , I know very well that this girl could cure your wife of her ill propensities if any living creature could . She is strong in character , admirably clear - headed , mild , gentle , womanly ; in fact , there is perhaps no one I respect so much , on the whole . "
79932	79937	79939	79939	Julian	118	" Respect , only ? "
79943	79995	79996	79996	Waymark	210	" Ye - es ; yes , I believe I am perfectly honest in saying so , though I could n't have been so sure about it some little time ago . Our relations , no doubt , are peculiar ; on her side there is no more warmth than on mine "
80001	80019	79539	79539	he	118	" and indeed her clear sight has no doubt gauged me fairly well at my true value . "
80020	80026	79539	79539	he	118	" What is her name ? "
80027	80031	79539	79539	he	118	" Ida Starr . "
80032	80035	80037	80037	Julian	118	" What ! "
80040	80057	80037	80037	Julian	118	" That is a strange thing ! You have noticed the scar on Harriet 's forehead ? "
80058	80061	79539	79539	he	118	" Well ? "
80062	80120	80037	80037	Julian	118	" Why , it was a wound given her at school by a girl of that very name ! I remember the name as well as possible . It was a blow with a slate dealt in passion some quarrel or other . They were both children then , and Ida Starr left the school in consequence . "
80121	80132	80134	80134	Waymark	210	" Is it possible that it is the same person ? "
80140	80153	80037	80037	Julian	118	" If so , that puts a new difficulty in our way . "
80154	80162	80037	80037	Julian	118	" Removes one , I should have thought "
80163	80173	80175	80175	Julian	118	" Harriet is not of a very forgiving nature , "
80178	80214	80037	80037	Julian	118	" I should n't have supposed she was ; but a long time has gone by since then , and , after all , one is generally glad to see an old school - fellow . "
80249	80255	80256	80256	he	130	" Do n't run away , "
80259	80269	80256	80256	he	130	" You ought to know O'Gree in the flesh . "
80412	80418	80420	80420	O'Gree	142	" The battle 's won ! "
80432	80459	80420	80420	O'Gree	142	" The campaign 's at an end ! I 'm sorry if I 've driven your friend away , but I was bound to tell you . "
80460	80473	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" All right . Let me have a description of the manoeuvres . "
80474	80481	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" Look here , my boy , "
80489	80535	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" you 've never been very willing to talk to me about her . Now , before I tell you anything , I want to know this . Why would n't you tell me how you first got to know her , and so on ? "
80536	80556	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" Before I answer , I want to know this : have you found out why I would n't ? "
80557	80590	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" Yes , I have that is , I suppose I have and from her own lips , too ! You knew her when she lived near the Strand there , eh ? "
80591	80595	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" I did . "
80596	80661	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" Well now , understand , my boy . I do n't want to hear anything disagreeable ; in fact , I wo n't listen to anything disagreeable ; all I want to know is , whether I may safely tell you what she has told me . If you do n't know it already , there 's no need to talk of it . "
80662	80683	80483	80483	O'Gree	142	" I understand , and I do n't think you can tell me anything I 'm not well aware of . "
80684	81163	81164	81164	Sally	105	" Sure , then , I will tell you , and if there 's another girl as brave and honest as Sally in all this worruld , I 'll be obliged if you 'll make me acquainted with her ! Well , you know she has a Saturday afternoon off every month . It has n't been a very cheerful day , but it could n't be missed ; and , as it was too rainy to walk about , I could n't think of any better place to go to than the British Museum . Of course I wanted to find a quiet corner , but there were people about everywhere , and the best we could manage was in the mummy - room . We looked at all the mummies , and I told her all I knew about them , and I kept thinking to myself : Now , how can I work round to it ? I 've tried so often , you know , and she 's always escaped me , somehow , and I could n't help thinking it was because I had n't gone about it in the proper way . Well , we 'd been staring at a mummy for about a quarter of an hour , and neither of us said anything , when all at once a rare idea came into my head . ' Sally , ' I said , glancing round to see that there was no one by , ' that mummy was very likely a pretty girl like you , once . ' ' Do you think so ? ' she said , with that look of hers which makes me feel like a galvanic battery . ' I do , ' I said , ' and what 's more , there may once have been another mummy , a man - mummy , standing by her just as I am standing by you , and wanting very much to ask her something , and shaking in his shoes for fear he should n't get the right answer . ' ' Did the mummies wear shoes when they were alive ? ' she asked , all at once . ' Wear shoes ! ' I cried out . ' I ca n't tell you , Sally ; but one thing I feel very sure of , and that is that they had hearts . Now , suppose , ' I said , ' we 're those two mummies ' ' I 'm sure it 's bad luck ! ' interrupted Sally . ' Oh no , it is n't , ' said I , seeing something in her face which made me think it was the opposite . ' Let me go on . Now , suppose the one mummy said to the other , "
81165	81205	81206	81206	Sally	105	" ' ' Were the girl - mummies called Sally ? ' she interrupted again . ' Sure I ca n't say , ' said I , ' but we 'll suppose so . Well , suppose he said , "
81273	81273	81264	81267	the girl - mummy	1965	"
81283	81528	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" She did n't answer at once , and there was something very queer in her face . All at once she said , ' What has Mr. Waymark told you about me ? ' ' Why , just nothing at all , ' I said , rather puzzled . ' And do you know , ' she asked then , without looking at me , ' what sort of a girl I am ? ' Well , all at once there came something into my head that I 'd never thought of before , and I was staggered for a moment ; I could n't say anything . But I got over it . ' I do n't want to know anything , ' I said . ' All I know is , that I like you better than I ever shall any one else , and I want you to promise to be my wife , some day . ' ' Then you must let me tell you all my story first , ' she said . ' I wo n't answer till you know everything . ' And so she told me what it seems you know . Well , if I thought much of her before , I thought a thousand times as much after that ! And do you know what ? I believe it was on my account that she want and took that place in the shop . "
81529	81532	81534	81534	Waymark	130	" Precisely , "
81536	81541	81543	81544	the other	449	" You think so ? "
81548	81570	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" I guessed as much when she met me that day and said I might let you know where she was . "
81571	81574	81576	81576	O'Gree	142	" Ha ! "
81583	81591	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" And so the matter is settled ? "
81592	81703	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" All but the most important part of it . There 's no chance of my being able to marry for long enough to come . Now , can you give me any advice ? I 've quite made up my mind to leave Tootle . The position is n't worthy of a gentleman ; I 'm losing my self - respect . The she - Tootle gets worse and worse . If I do n't electrify her , one of these days , with an outburst of ferocious indignation , she will only have my patience to thank . Let her beware how she drives the lion to bay ! "
81704	81715	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" Could n't you get a non - resident mastership ? "
81716	81729	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" I must try , but the pay is so devilish small . "
81730	81738	81278	81278	O'Gree	142	" We must talk the matter over . "
82077	82158	82063	82063	he	130	" Yes , I do love you ; but at the same time I know too well the uncertainty of love to go through the pretence of binding myself to you for ever . Will you accept my love in its present sincerity , neither hoping nor fearing , knowing that whatever happens is beyond our own control , feeling with me that only an ignoble nature can descend to the affectation of union when the real links are broken ? "
83102	83108	83109	83109	he	130	" It 's rather strange , "
83112	83140	83109	83109	he	130	" that you should have been asking me questions about Mrs. Casti . Since then I 've discovered that you probably know her , or once did . "
83145	83157	83141	83141	Ida	101	" Do you remember once having a schoolfellow called Harriet Smales ? "
83158	83164	83174	83174	Ida	101	" Is that her name ? "
83165	83173	83141	83141	Ida	101	" It was , before her marriage . "
83187	83194	83195	83195	she	101	" Yes , I remember her , "
83198	83203	83195	83195	she	101	" and not pleasantly . "
83204	83215	83228	83228	she	101	" You would n't care to renew her acquaintance then ? "
83284	83292	83294	83294	Ida	101	" Has she been told about me ? "
83296	83309	83310	83310	Waymark	130	" Nothing was to be said till I had spoken to you . "
83346	83371	83372	83372	He	130	" I said that I had come to know you by chance , and that strange as it might sound we were simply friends . "
83388	83394	83395	83395	he	130	" You will believe me , "
83400	83412	83395	83395	he	130	" when I tell you that I really said nothing more ? "
83413	83422	83424	83424	Ida	101	" I never doubt a word of yours , "
83429	83477	83395	83395	he	130	" Casti was overjoyed at the thought of finding such a friend for his wife . Of course I told him that he must not certainly count either on your consent or on his wife 's . Hers I thought to be perhaps more doubtful than yours . "
83478	83489	83491	83491	Ida	101	" Could I really be of any use to her , "
83497	83507	83491	83491	Ida	101	" with so little free time as I have ? "
83508	83594	83395	83395	he	130	" Supposing she would welcome you , I really believe you could be of great use . She is a strange creature , miserably weak in body and mind . If you could get to regard this as a sort of good work you were called upon to undertake , you would very likely be little less than an angel of mercy to both of them . Casti is falling into grievous unhappiness why , you will understand sufficiently if you come to know them . "
83595	83605	83491	83491	Ida	101	" Do you think she bears malice against me ? "
83606	83648	83395	83395	he	130	" Of that I know nothing . Casti said she had never spoken of you in that way . By - the - by , she still has a scar on her forehead , I often wondered how it came there . "
83652	83662	83664	83664	Waymark	130	" What a little termagant you must have been ! "
83668	83689	83664	83664	Waymark	130	" How hard it is to fancy you at that age , Ida . What was the quarrel all about ? "
83690	83698	83699	83699	she	101	" I ca n't speak of it , "
83709	83723	83699	83699	she	101	" It is so long ago ; and I want to forget it . "
83728	83738	83739	83739	Ida	101	" Do you wish me to be her friend ? "
83746	83755	83664	83664	Waymark	130	" Certainly not if you dislike the thought . "
83756	83782	83664	83664	Waymark	130	" No , no . But you think it would be doing good ? you would like me to help your friend if I can ? "
83783	83789	83791	83791	Waymark	130	" Yes , I should , "
83795	83849	83664	83664	Waymark	130	" Then I hope she will be willing to let me go and see her . I will do my very best . Let us lose no time in trying . It is such a strange thing that we should meet again in this way ; perhaps it is something more than chance . "
83853	83860	83861	83861	she	1982	" You think I am superstitious ? "
83865	83885	83861	83861	she	1982	" I often feel so . I have all sorts of hopes and faiths that you would laugh at . "
85222	85230	85231	85231	she	99	" You 're sorry you married me , "
85239	85253	85231	85231	she	99	" It 's no good saying no ; I 'm sure you are . "
85477	85483	85484	85484	she	99	" Does Julian know her ? "
85497	85504	85484	85484	she	99	" No , he does not . "
85526	85532	85533	85533	he	118	" She is some one , "
85537	85604	85533	85533	he	118	" for whom I have a great regard . As I say , she has really no friends , and she earns her own living . I feel sure you would find her company pleasant ; she is sensible and cheerful , and would be very grateful for any kindness you showed her . Her name , by - the - by , is Ida Starr . "
85605	85609	85533	85533	he	118	" Ida Starr ? "
85610	85618	85533	85533	he	118	" Is the name familiar to you ? "
85619	85629	85533	85533	he	118	" I used to know some one called that . "
85630	85663	85533	85533	he	118	" Indeed ? How strange it would be if you knew her already . I have spoken to her of you , but she did n't tell me she knew your name . "
85664	85692	85533	85533	he	118	" Oh no , she would n't . It was years and years ago . We used to go to school together if it 's the same . "
85839	85846	85847	85847	Waymark	130	" When may I bring her ! "
85850	85877	85847	85847	Waymark	130	" Perhaps you would like to talk it over with Julian first ? By - the - by , perhaps he remembers her as your schoolfellow ? "
85878	85888	85889	85889	she	99	" I do n't know , I 'm sure , "
85898	85920	85889	85889	she	99	" I do n't see what he can have to say against it . Bring her as soon as you like . "
85921	85941	85847	85847	Waymark	130	" She is not free till seven at night . Perhaps we had better leave it till next Sunday ? "
85942	85955	85889	85889	she	99	" Why ? Why could n't she come to - morrow night ? "
85956	85973	85847	85847	Waymark	130	" It is very good of you . I have no doubt she would be glad . "
85982	85989	85991	85991	Harriet	99	" Do you remember Ida Starr ? "
86004	86009	86011	86011	Julian	118	" Certainly I do , "
86019	86022	86011	86011	Julian	118	" Why ? "
86023	86031	86036	86036	she	99	" When did you see her last ? "
86047	86051	86053	86053	Julian	118	" See her ? "
86057	86069	86053	86053	Julian	118	" Do you mean the girl you went to school with ? "
86070	86076	86036	86036	she	99	" Of course I do . "
86077	86091	86053	86053	Julian	118	" I do n't know that I ever saw her in my life . "
86092	86104	86036	86036	she	99	" Well , she 's coming here to - morrow night . "
86109	86120	86121	86121	Harriet	99	" Has n't he ever spoken to you about her ? "
86124	86127	86129	86129	Julian	118	" No , "
86133	86153	86129	86129	Julian	118	" I suppose he thought it was a private affair , in which no one else had any interest . "
86154	86162	86163	86163	he	118	" I hope you will like her , "
86167	86185	86163	86163	he	118	" It will be very nice to have a friend of that kind , wo n't it ? "
86186	86202	86129	86129	Julian	118	" Yes , if she does n't throw one of my own plates at me . "
86208	86217	86218	86218	Julian	118	" Well , how do you like her ? "
86228	86239	86129	86129	Julian	118	" Oh , I dare say she 's all right , "
86244	86256	86129	86129	Julian	118	" She 's got a good deal to say for herself . "
86267	86274	86276	86276	Harriet	99	" What does she work at ? "
86287	86293	86328	86328	He	118	" I have no idea . "
86294	86306	86328	86328	He	118	" It 's my belief she does n't work at all . "
86307	86317	86319	86319	Julian	118	" Why should Waymark have said so , then ? "
86367	86370	86371	86371	he	118	" Harriet , "
86383	86411	86371	86371	he	118	" why do you always prefer to think the worst of people ? I always look for the good rather than the evil in people I meet . "
86412	86425	86427	86427	Harriet	99	" We 're different in a good many things , you see , "
86471	86478	86479	86479	he	118	" I am sure of this , "
86482	86555	86479	86479	he	118	" If you will only meet her in her own spirit , you will find her a valuable friend just such a friend as you need . But of course if you begin with all manner of prejudices and suspicions , it will be very hard for her to make you believe in her sincerity . Certainly her kindness , her sympathy , her whole manner , was perfect to - night . "
86556	86566	86650	86650	Julian	118	" You seemed to notice her a good deal . "
86567	86584	86479	86479	he	118	" Naturally I did , being so anxious that you should find a friend and companion . "
86585	86597	86599	86599	Harriet	99	" And who is she , I should like to know ? "
86607	86636	86599	86599	Harriet	99	" How can I tell that she 's a proper person to be a friend to me ? I know what her mother was , at all events . "
86637	86649	86479	86479	he	118	" Her mother ? What do you know of her mother ? "
86666	86670	86672	86672	Harriet	99	" Never mind , "
86677	86686	86687	86687	Julian	118	" I have no idea what you mean , "
86690	86728	86729	86729	he	118	" At all events I can trust Waymark , and I know very well he would not have brought her here , if she had n't been a proper person for you to know . But come , "
86744	86835	86729	86729	he	118	" there 's surely no need for us to talk like this , Harriet . I am sure you will like her , when you know her better . Promise me that you will try , dear . You are so lonely , and it would rejoice me so to feel that you had a friend to help you and to be a comfort to you . At all events you will judge her on her own merits , wo n't you , and put aside all kind of prejudice ? "
86836	86856	86899	86899	he	130	" I have n't said I should n't ; but I suppose I must get to know her first ? "
86959	86965	86966	86966	he	425	" Things go well still ? "
86978	86993	86949	86950	The latter	425	" Very well indeed . Harriet has n't been out one night this week . "
86994	87002	86949	86950	The latter	425	" And you think it will last ? "
87003	87009	86949	86950	The latter	425	" I have good hope . "
87049	87053	86949	86950	The latter	425	" Pretty often , "
87058	87080	86949	86950	The latter	425	" I am her tutor , in a sort of way . We read together , and that kind of thing . "
87081	87086	86949	86950	The latter	425	" At her lodgings ? "
87087	87097	86949	86950	The latter	425	" Yes . Does it seem a queer arrangement ? "
87098	87104	87106	87106	Julian	118	" She seems very intelligent , "
87120	87138	87106	87106	Julian	118	" Is n't it a pity that she ca n't find some employment better suited to her ? "
87139	87153	86949	86950	The latter	425	" I do n't see what is open . Could you suggest anything ? "
87158	87173	87174	87174	he	118	" In any case , it wo n't last very long , I suppose ? "
87191	87194	87106	87106	Julian	118	" Why ? "
87204	87207	87209	87209	Waymark	130	" No , "
87217	87270	87212	87212	his	130	" It is n't as you think . It is perfectly understood between us that we are to be agreeable company to each other , and absolutely nothing beyond that . I have no motive for leading you astray in the matter . However things were , I would tell you frankly . "
87276	87291	87292	87292	Waymark	130	" Do you think there is anything like confidence between your wife and her ? "
87295	87324	87367	87367	Julian	118	" That I hardly know . When I am present , of course they only talk about ordinary women 's interests , household affairs , and so on . "
87325	87350	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Then you have no means of well , of knowing whether she has spoken about me to your wife in any particular way ? "
87351	87362	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Nothing of the kind has ever been hinted to me "
87363	87366	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Waymark , "
87374	87381	87367	87367	Julian	118	" you are a strange fellow . "
87382	87387	87367	87367	Julian	118	" In what respect . "
87388	87399	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Do you mean to tell me honestly that that you "
87400	87418	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Well ? you mean to say , that I am not in love with the girl ? "
87419	87430	87432	87432	Julian	118	" No , I was n't going to say that , "
87451	87472	87432	87432	Julian	118	" I meant , do you really believe that she has no kind of regard for you beyond mere friendship ? "
87473	87488	87367	87367	Julian	118	" Why ? Have you formed any conclusions of your own on the point ? "
87489	87497	87432	87432	Julian	118	" How could I help doing so ? "
87498	87505	87507	87507	Waymark	130	" And you look on me , "
87515	87540	87507	87507	Waymark	130	" as an insensible dog , with a treasure thrown at his feet which he is quite incapable of appreciating or making use of ? "
87541	87568	87432	87432	Julian	118	" No . I only feel that your position must be a very difficult one . But perhaps you had rather not speak of these things ? "
87569	87591	87507	87507	Waymark	130	" On the contrary . You are perfectly right , and the position is as difficult as it well could be . "
87592	87609	87432	87432	Julian	118	" You had made your choice , I suppose , before you knew Ida at all ? "
87610	87658	87507	87507	Waymark	130	" So far from that , I have n't even made it yet . I am not at all sure that my chance of ever marrying Maud Enderby is not so utterly remote , that t ought to put aside all thought of it . In that case "
87659	87669	87671	87671	Julian	118	" But this is a strange state of mind , "
87678	87689	87671	87671	Julian	118	" Is it possible to balance feelings in this way ? "
87690	87702	87507	87507	Waymark	130	" You , in my position , would have no doubt ? "
87703	87711	87713	87713	Julian	118	" I do n't know Miss Enderby , "
87830	87833	87834	87834	he	130	" Well , "
87838	87895	87834	87834	he	130	" we 'll talk about this another time . Perhaps I shall have more to tell you . Do n't be gloomy . Look , here I am just upon the end of my novel . If all goes smoothly I shall finish it in a fortnight , and then I will read it to you . "
87896	87910	87912	87912	Julian	118	" I hope you may have better luck with it than I had , "
87914	87982	87834	87834	he	130	" Oh , your time is yet to come . And it 's very likely I shall be no better off . There are things in the book which will scarcely recommend it to the British parent . But it shall be published , if it is at my own expense . If it comes to the worst , I shall sell my mining shares to Woodstock . "
87983	87987	87989	87989	Julian	118	" After all , "
87993	87999	87989	87989	Julian	118	" you are a capitalist . "
88000	88010	87834	87834	he	130	" Yes , and much good it does me . "
88220	88227	88228	88228	he	118	" What is it , dear ? "
88236	88251	88228	88228	he	118	" You are very quiet . Shall I put away the book and talk ? "
88252	88260	88298	88298	She	99	" No ; I 'm all right . "
88261	88273	88274	88274	he	118	" You 've been much better lately , have n't you ? "
88282	88297	88274	88274	he	118	" Let me feel your pulse ; you know I 'm half a doctor . "
88325	88379	88305	88305	Julian	118	" You do n't know how happy it makes me to see you and Ida such good friends . I was sure it would be so . Do n't you feel there is something soothing in her society ? She speaks so gently , and always brings a sort of sunshine with her . "
88393	88420	88380	88380	Harriet	99	" When are you going to see her again ? It 's hardly fair to let the visiting be always on her side , is it ? "
88421	88435	88436	88436	Julian	118	" I shall go when I feel able . Perhaps to - morrow . "
88496	88509	88510	88510	Ida	101	" I fear there will never be anything like confidence between us , "
88514	88538	88510	88510	Ida	101	" Do you know that I am sometimes almost afraid of her ; sometimes she looks and speaks as if she hated me . "
88539	88550	88551	88551	Waymark	130	" She is a poor , ill - conditioned creature , "
88558	88563	88565	88565	Ida	101	" Can you explain , "
88567	88577	88565	88565	Ida	101	" how it was that Mr. Casti married her ? "
88578	88625	88510	88510	Ida	101	" For my life , I ca n't ! I half believe it was out of mere pity ; I should n't wonder if the proposal came from her side . Casti might once have done something ; but I 'm afraid he never will now . "
88626	88720	88565	88565	Ida	101	" And he is so very good to her . I pity him from my heart whenever I see them together . Often I have been so discouraged by her cold suspicious ways , that I half - thought I should have to give it up , but I felt it would be cruel to desert him so . I met him in the street the other night just as I was going to her , and he thanked me for what I was doing in a way that almost made me cry . "
88721	88728	88730	88730	Waymark	130	" By - the - by , "
88732	88754	88730	88730	Waymark	130	" you know her too well to venture upon anything like direct criticism of her behaviour , when you talk together ! "
88755	88779	88565	88565	Ida	101	" Indeed , I scarcely venture to speak of herself at all . It would be hard to say what we talk about . "
88780	88784	88785	88785	Waymark	130	" Of course , "
88793	88847	88785	88785	Waymark	130	" there are limits to self - devotion . So long as it seems to you that there is any chance of doing some good , well , persevere . But you must n't be sacrificed to such a situation . The time you give her is so much absolute loss to yourself . "
88848	88868	88565	88565	Ida	101	" Oh , but I work hard to make up for it . You are not dissatisfied with me ? "
88869	88881	88785	88785	Waymark	130	" And what if I were ? Would it matter much ? "
88971	88979	88964	88964	she	101	" Yes , it would matter much . "
89048	89055	89056	89056	Ida	101	" This is kind of you , "
89059	89089	89056	89056	Ida	101	" We 'll have some tea , and then , if you 're not too tired , we might go into the park . It will be cool then . "
89168	89180	89181	89181	she	101	" You wo n't mind being left alone for a minute ? "
89184	89196	89181	89181	she	101	" Oh , no ; I 'll amuse myself with Grim . "
89240	89248	89234	89234	she	101	" Get off ; you black beast ! "
89365	89369	89370	89370	she	101	" Gold chain , "
89373	89399	89370	89370	she	101	" bracelet ; seal - skin ; what was she doing with all those things , I wonder ? Ho , ho , Miss Starr ? "
89440	89446	89448	89448	Ida	101	" Have I been long ? "
89455	89471	89448	89448	Ida	101	" The kettle wo n't be a minute . You 'll take your things off ? "
89525	89533	89534	89534	Ida	101	" You are better to - day ? "
89539	89550	89534	89534	Ida	101	" Perhaps so ; but it does n't last long . "
89551	89578	89579	89579	she	101	" Oh , you must be more hopeful . Try not to look so much on the dark side of things . How would you be , "
89589	89617	89579	89579	she	101	" if you had to work all day , like me ? I 'm sure you 've a great deal to make you feel happy and thankful . "
89618	89625	89627	89627	Harriet	99	" I do n't know what , "
89630	89644	89579	89579	she	101	" But your husband , your home , your long , free days ? "
89688	89694	89695	89695	she	101	" It may sound strange , "
89702	89722	89695	89695	she	101	" but I think I should be very willing to endure bad health for a position something like yours . "
89935	89946	89956	89956	she	153	" Slimy 's up to his larks to - night , "
89966	90001	89956	89956	she	153	" He 'll be losin ' his sweet temper just now , see if he do n't , an ' then one o ' them chaps 'll get a bash i ' the eye . "
90002	90014	90016	90016	Harriet	99	" I always like to see him singing on his head , "
90034	90070	89956	89956	she	153	" It 's funny , ai n't it ? And ' ow 's the world been a - usin ' you , Harriet ? Seen anything more o ' that affectionate friend o ' yourn ? "
90083	90092	90094	90094	Harriet	99	" Have you found out anything about her ? "
90097	90117	89956	89956	she	153	" Why yes , I have ; somethin' as 'll amuse you . It 's just as I thought . "
90118	90124	89956	89956	she	153	" How do you mean ? "
90125	90212	89956	89956	she	153	" Why , Bella , was in ' ere th ' other night , so I says to her , ' Bella , ' I says , ' did n't you never hear of a girl called Ida Starr ? ' I says . ' Course I did , ' she says . ' One o ' the ' igh an ' ' aughty lot , an ' she lived by herself somewhere in the Strand . ' So it 's just as I told you . "
90213	90221	89956	89956	she	153	" But what is she doing now ? "
90222	90230	89956	89956	she	153	" You say she 's turned modest . "
90231	90240	90242	90242	Harriet	99	" I ca n't make her out quite , "
90253	90298	90242	90242	Harriet	99	" I 've been at her lodgings tonight , and , whilst she was out of the room , I happened to get sight of a lot of pawn - tickets , for gold chains and sealskins , and I do n't know what . "
90299	90313	90315	90316	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Spouted 'em all when she threw up the job , I s'pose , "
90318	90328	90315	90316	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" You 're sure she does go to work ? "
90329	90371	90242	90242	Harriet	99	" Yes , I 've had somebody to follow her and watch her . There 's Waymark goes to see her often , and I should n't wonder if she half keeps him ; he 's just that kind of fellow . "
90372	90383	90385	90386	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" You have n't caught no one else going there ? "
90395	90405	90407	90407	Harriet	99	" No , I have n't , not yet , "
90413	90429	90407	90407	Harriet	99	" but I believe he does go there , or else sees her somewhere else . "
90430	90433	90435	90436	the landlady	386	" Well , "
90445	90511	90435	90436	the landlady	386	" I told you from the first as I ' adn't much opinion of men as is so anxious to have their wives friendly with other women . There 's always something at the bottom of it , you may bet . It 's my belief he 's one too many for you , Harriet ; you 're too simple - minded to catch him . "
90512	90522	90524	90525	the girl	316	" I 'll have a good try , though , "
90532	90598	90524	90525	the girl	316	" Perhaps I 'm not so simple as you think . I 'm pretty quick in tumbling to things no fear . If they think I do n't notice what goes on , they must take me for a damned silly fool , that 's all ! Why , I 've seen them wink at each other , when they thought I was n't looking . "
90599	90613	90615	90616	the woman	448	" You 're not such a fool as to leave them alone together ? "
90631	90677	90615	90616	the woman	448	" No fear ! But they understand each other ; I can see that well enough . And he writes to her ; I 'm dead sure he writes to her . Let me get hold of a letter just once , that 's all ! "
90678	90707	90615	90616	the woman	448	" And he 's orful good - natured to her , ai n't he ? Looks after her when she has tea with you , and so on ? "
90708	90750	90615	90616	the woman	448	" I should think he did . It 's all ' Wo n't Miss Starr have this ? ' and ' Wo n't Miss Starr have that ? ' He scarcely takes his eyes off of her , all the time . "
90751	90785	90615	90616	the woman	448	" I know , I know ; it 's allus the same ! You keep your eyes open , Harriet , and you 'll ' ave your reward , as the Scriptures says . "
90819	90829	90830	90830	he	118	" Have you been with Ida all the evening ? "
90833	90840	90842	90842	her	2057	" No , I have n't , "
90864	90874	90875	90875	she	2057	" Do you know where my silver spoon is ? "
90883	90888	90889	90889	he	118	" Your silver spoon ? "
90895	90901	90889	90889	he	118	" Have you lost it ? "
90941	90948	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" I ca n't find it , "
90952	90980	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" I was showing it to Ida Starr when she was here on Sunday , and now I come to look for it , it 's gone . "
90981	90992	90994	90994	Julian	118	" Oh , it ca n't be very far off , "
90996	91005	90994	90994	Julian	118	" You 'll find it if you look . "
91006	91026	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" But I tell you I 've looked everywhere . It 's gone , that 's all I know . "
91027	91042	90994	90994	Julian	118	" Well , but what do you mean ? How can it have gone ? "
91043	91060	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" I do n't know . I only know I was showing it her on Sunday . "
91061	91072	91074	91074	Julian	118	" And what connection is there between the two things ? "
91079	91096	91074	91074	Julian	118	" You do n't wish me to understand that Ida Starr knows anything about the spoon ? "
91097	91107	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" How can I tell ? It 's gone . "
91108	91111	91113	91113	Julian	118	" Come , "
91119	91151	91113	91113	Julian	118	" this is too absurd , Harriet ! You must have taken leave of your senses . If it 's gone , then some one in the house has taken it . "
91152	91159	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" And why not Ida Starr ? "
91170	91184	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" Why not ? Simply because she is incapable of such a thing . "
91185	91221	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" Perhaps you think so , no doubt . You think a good deal of her , it seems to me . Perhaps you do n't know quite as much about her as I do . "
91222	91230	91232	91232	Julian	118	" I fancy I know much more , "
91235	91241	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" Oh , do you ? "
91242	91274	90949	90949	Harriet	99	" If you think her capable of stealing your spoon , you show complete ignorance of her character . What do you know of her that you should have such suspicions ? "
91275	91279	91281	91281	Harriet	99	" Never mind , "
91298	91309	91310	91310	he	118	" We will talk about this again to - morrow , "
91313	91352	91310	91310	he	118	" when you have had time to think . You are under some strange delusion . After all , I expect you will find the spoon , and then you 'll be sorry for having been so hasty . "
92835	92914	92831	92831	she	101	" I have been without work for a fortnight . All my money is done , and I am in want . Can you send me some , for present help , till I get more work ? Do not bring it yourself , and do not speak a word of this when you see me , I beg you earnestly . If I shall fail to get work , I will speak to you of my own accord .
92917	92917	92831	92831	she	101	"
93562	93604	93550	93550	Harriet	216	" I 've only a minute ago sent a note , asking you to be sure to come round to - night . I wanted you to help me with this new hat ; you have such good taste in trimming . "
93649	93657	93658	93658	she	101	" Give me your hat and jacket , "
93661	93672	93658	93658	she	101	" and let me take them into the other room . "
93934	93942	93943	93943	she	216	" I 've caught her at last , "
93956	93983	93943	93943	she	216	" She 's taken a brooch of mine . I put it in a particular place in my bed - room , and it 's gone . "
93984	93992	93994	93995	the constable	2095	" Was she alone in the room ? "
94007	94029	93994	93995	the constable	2095	" Yes , she went in alone to put her things on . Be quick , or she 'll be off ! "
94030	94039	93943	93943	she	216	" I understand you give her in charge ? "
94040	94046	93994	93995	the constable	2095	" Of course I do . "
94078	94090	94092	94093	the constable	2095	" This lady charges you with stealing some articles of hers , "
94101	94111	94092	94093	the constable	2095	" You must come with me to the station . "
94204	94211	94213	94214	the inspector	2105	" Have you got this brooch ? "
94299	94303	94305	94306	the inspector	2105	" Look out , "
94308	94315	94305	94306	the inspector	2105	" Do n't let her fall . "
94417	94421	94422	94422	Waymark	130	" Anything amiss ? "
94474	94480	94481	94481	Waymark	130	" What 's the matter ? "
94485	94493	94481	94481	Waymark	130	" Do you know anything about Ida ? "
94494	94504	94523	94523	Waymark	130	" She 's locked up in the police cells , "
94509	94522	94523	94523	Waymark	130	" My wife has accused her of stealing things from our rooms . "
94528	94538	94539	94539	he	118	" Cacti , what 's the matter with you ? "
94555	94568	94539	94539	he	118	" Are you ill ? Do you know what you 're saying ? "
94579	94648	94523	94523	Waymark	130	" I know what I 'm saying , Waymark I 've only just heard it . She has come back home from somewhere only just now she seems to have been drinking . It happened in the middle of the day , whilst I was at the hospital . She gave her in charge to a policeman in the street , and a brooch was found on her . "
94649	94660	94539	94539	he	118	" A brooch found on her ? Your wife 's ? "
94661	94718	94523	94523	Waymark	130	" Yes . When she came in , she railed at me like a fury , and charged me with the most monstrous things . I ca n't and wo n't go back there to - night ! I shall go mad if I hear her voice . I will walk about the streets till morning . "
94719	94731	94539	94539	he	118	" And you tell me that Ida Starr is in custody ? "
94732	94745	94523	94523	Waymark	130	" She is . My wife accuses her of stealing several things . "
94746	94752	94754	94754	Waymark	130	" And you believe this ? "
94786	94914	94915	94915	He	2116	" I do n't know . I ca n't say . She says that Ida confessed , and , gave the brooch up at once . But her devilish malice is equal to anything . I see into her character as I never did before . Good God , if you could have seen her face as she told me ! And Ida , Ida ! I am afraid of myself , Waymark . If I had stayed to listen another moment , I should have struck her . It seemed as if every vein was bursting . How am I ever to live with her again ? I dare not ! I should kill her in some moment of madness ! What will happen to Ida ? "
94961	94971	94972	94972	he	130	" I must go to the police - station , "
94995	95017	94972	94972	he	130	" You , I think , had better stay here . Is there any danger of her coming to seek you ? "
95036	95044	95045	95045	Waymark	130	" I shall be back very quickly , "
95060	95083	95045	95045	Waymark	130	" You must n't give way like this , old fellow ; this is horrible weakness . Dare I leave you alone ? "
95208	95218	95219	95219	Waymark	130	" Shall you call at home on your way ? "
95223	95226	95219	95219	Waymark	130	" No . "
95227	95236	95219	95219	Waymark	130	" But what do you mean to do ? "
95237	95261	95219	95219	Waymark	130	" I must think during the day . I shall come to - night , and you will tell me what has happened . "
95978	95987	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" I have come on rather serious business , "
95991	96010	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" I want to ask your advice in a very disagreeable matter a criminal case , in fact . "
96036	96044	96045	96045	he	130	" What have you been up to ? "
96068	96126	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" It only concerns myself indirectly . It 's all about a girl , who is charged with a theft she is perhaps quite innocent of . If so , she is being made the victim of a conspiracy , or something of the kind . She was remanded to - day at Westminster for a week . "
96127	96142	96284	96285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" A girl , eh ? And what 's your interest in the business ? "
96143	96166	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" Well , if you do n't mind I shall have to go a little into detail . You are at liberty ? "
96167	96171	96284	96285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Go on . "
96172	96219	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" She is a friend of mine . No , I mean what I say ; there is absolutely nothing else between us , and never has been . I should like to know whether you are satisfied to believe that ; much depends on it . "
96220	96225	96284	96285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Age and appearance ? "
96226	96237	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" About twenty not quite so much and strikingly handsome . "
96238	96245	96284	96285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" H'm . Position in life ? "
96246	96272	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" A year ago was on the streets , to put it plainly ; since then has been getting her living at laundry - work . "
96273	96278	96284	96285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" H'm . Name ? "
96279	96283	95988	95988	Waymark	130	" Ida Starr . "
96333	96340	96323	96323	he	114	" Is that her real name ? "
96341	96346	96323	96323	he	114	" I believe so . "
96385	96393	96394	96394	he	1383	" What do you know about her ? "
96411	96429	96394	96394	he	1383	" I mean , of her earlier life . Do you know who she is at all ? "
96430	96448	96394	96394	he	1383	" She has told me her whole story a rather uncommon one , full of good situations . "
96449	96455	96394	96394	he	1383	" What do you mean ? "
96468	96473	96474	96474	he	130	" What annoys you ? "
96480	96488	96490	96491	the other	449	" Tell me something of the story , "
96504	96536	96490	96491	the other	449	" I have a twinge of that damned rheumatism every now and then , and it makes me rather crusty . Do you think her story is to be depended upon ? "
96537	96545	96582	96582	he	1383	" Yes , I believe it is . "
96572	96577	96579	96579	Abraham	115	" Now go on , "
96590	96600	96579	96579	Abraham	115	" and explain the scrape she 's got into . "
96605	96613	96614	96614	Abraham	115	" And you mean to tell me , "
96624	96636	96614	96614	Abraham	115	" that there 's been nothing more between you than that ? "
96637	96641	96614	96614	Abraham	115	" Absolutely nothing . "
96642	96649	96614	96614	Abraham	115	" I do n't believe you . "
96693	96768	96680	96680	Waymark	130	" Well if you do n't believe me , of course I can offer no proof ; and I know well enough that every presumption is against me . Still , I tell you the plain fact ; and what reason have I for hiding the truth ? If I had been living with the girl , I should have said so , as an extra reason for asking your help in the matter . "
96769	96776	96778	96778	Woodstock	115	" What help can I give ? "
96804	96840	96795	96795	He	1383	" I thought you might suggest something as to modes of defence , and the like . The expenses I would somehow or other meet myself . It appears that she will plead not guilty . "
96841	96848	96795	96795	He	1383	" And what 's your belief ? "
96849	96858	96795	96795	He	1383	" I ca n't make up my mind . "
96859	96901	96795	96795	He	1383	" In that case , it seems to me , you ought to give her the benefit of the doubt ; especially as you seem to have made up your mind pretty clearly about this Mrs. What's - her - name . "
96914	96925	96926	96926	Abraham	115	" What are your intentions with regard to the girl ? "
96963	96969	96942	96942	He	114	" I have no intentions . "
96970	96981	96942	96942	He	114	" You would have had , but for this affair ? "
96982	96998	96942	96942	He	114	" No ; you are mistaken . I know the position is difficult to realise . "
96999	97011	96942	96942	He	114	" Have you intentions , then , in any other quarter ? "
97012	97018	96942	96942	He	114	" Well , perhaps yes . "
97019	97028	96942	96942	He	114	" I 've never heard anything of this . "
97029	97040	96942	96942	He	114	" I could scarcely talk of a matter so uncertain . "
97109	97117	97118	97118	he	114	" I 'll look into the business , "
97141	97151	97152	97152	He	114	" Yes , I 'll go and make inquiries . "
97164	97168	97169	97169	he	114	" Look here , "
97191	97245	97186	97186	he	114	" No ; it do n't matter . I 'll go and make inquiries . You can go now , if you like ; I mean to say , I suppose you 've told me all that 's necessary . Yes , you 'd better go , and look in again tomorrow morning . "
97386	97393	97394	97394	Waymark	130	" My main object in coming , "
97397	97416	97394	97394	Waymark	130	" was to look after her cat . I see you have been good enough to anticipate me . "
97417	97425	97427	97428	the woman	448	" The poor thing takes on sadly , "
97430	97464	97427	97428	the woman	448	" Of course I should n't have known nothing if the hofficers had n't come , and it ' ud just have starved to death . It seems to know you , sir ? "
97465	97498	97394	97394	Waymark	130	" Yes , yes , I dare say . Do you think you could make it convenient to keep the cat for the present , if I paid you for its food ? "
97499	97520	97427	97428	the woman	448	" Well , I do n't see why not , sir ; we ai n't got none of our own . "
97521	97561	97394	97394	Waymark	130	" And you would promise me to be kind to it ? I do n't mind the expense ; keep it well , and let me know what you spend . And of course I should consider your trouble . "
97953	97961	97962	97962	he	118	" What proof have you to offer , "
97973	97994	97962	97962	he	118	" that she is guilty of this , and that it is n't a plot you have laid against her ? "
97995	98003	98004	98004	she	216	" You can believe what you like , "
98008	98021	98004	98004	she	216	" Of course I know you 'll do your worst against me . "
98022	98071	97962	97962	he	118	" I wish you to answer my question . If I choose to suspect that you yourself put this brooch in her pocket and if other people choose to suspect the same , knowing your enmity against her , what proof can you give that she is guilty ? "
98072	98083	98004	98004	she	216	" It is n't the first thing she 's stolen . "
98084	98096	97962	97962	he	118	" What proof have you that she took those other things ? "
98097	98139	98004	98004	she	216	" Quite enough , I think . At all events , they 've found a pawn - ticket for the spoon at her lodgings , among a whole lot of other tickets for things she ca n't have come by honestly . "
98174	98184	98185	98185	Harriet	216	" You 're a good husband , you are , "
98196	98325	98185	98185	Harriet	216	" taking part against your own wife , and trying to make her out all that 's bad . But I think you 've had things your own way long enough . You thought I was a fool , did you , and could n't see what was going on ? You and your Ida Starr , indeed ! Oh , she would be such a good friend to me , would n't she ? She would do me so much good ; you thought so highly of her ; she was just the very girl to be my companion ; how lucky we found her ! I 'm much obliged to you , but I think I might have better friends than thieves and street - walkers . "
98326	98332	98334	98334	Julian	118	" What do you mean ? "
98350	98366	98185	98185	Harriet	216	" I mean what I say . As if you did n't know , indeed ! "
98367	98373	98374	98374	Julian	118	" Explain what you mean , "
98381	98392	98374	98374	Julian	118	" Who has said anything of that kind against her ? "
98393	98430	98185	98185	Harriet	216	" Who has ? Why I can bring half a dozen people who knew her when she was on the streets , before Waymark kept her . And you knew it , well enough no fear ! "
98431	98460	98374	98374	Julian	118	" It 's a lie , a cursed lie ! No one can say a word against her purity . Only a foul mind could imagine such things . "
98461	98521	98185	98185	Harriet	216	" Purity ! Oh yes , she 's very pure you know that , do n't you ? No doubt you 'll be a witness , and give evidence for her , and against me ; let everybody know how perfect she is , and what a beast and a liar I am ! You and your Ida Starr ! "
98686	98694	98695	98695	Abraham	115	" Oh , ay , the girl ! "
98702	98713	98695	98695	Abraham	115	" What did you say her name was ? Ida something "
98744	98750	98752	98753	the latter	425	" I 've been busy , "
98755	98800	98752	98753	the latter	425	" Never mind ; there 's time . She was remanded for a week , you said ? I 'll go and see Helter about her . May as well come along with me , and put the case in ' artistic ' form . "
98903	98915	98917	98918	Mr. Helter	221	" How did this girl lose her place at the laundry ? "
98936	98948	98950	98951	Mr. Woodstock	114	" And that 's all you can tell us , Waymark ? "
98962	98980	98950	98951	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Well , I have no more time at present . Look the thing up , Helter . "
99035	99070	99096	99096	he	114	" You have been kind . I thank you for everything . Try to think kindly of me , whatever happens ; I shall be conscious of it , and it will give me strength .
99073	99073	99071	99071	I.	130	"
99177	99181	99173	99173	her	101	" Not guilty . "
99223	99230	99232	99232	Waymark	130	" And what 's your opinion ? "
99234	99244	99246	99248	the old man	1383	" I could n't see the girl very well , "
99251	99261	99284	99285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" She has n't quite a fortnight to wait . "
99262	99265	99284	99285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" No . "
99266	99279	99284	99285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" You 're sure Helter will do all that can be done ? "
99280	99283	99284	99285	Mr. Woodstock	114	" Yes . "
99351	99357	99359	99359	Julian	118	" She will be convicted , "
99401	99409	99410	99410	he	130	" Did you sleep better last night ? "
99413	99455	99385	99386	The latter	425	" Good God , no ! I never closed my eyes . That 's the third night without rest . Waymark , get me an opiate of some kind , or I shall kill myself ; and let me sleep here . "
99456	99463	99385	99386	The latter	425	" What will your wife say ? "
99464	99473	99475	99475	Julian	118	" What do I care what she says ! "
99493	99537	99475	99475	Julian	118	" Do n't use that word ' wife , ' it is profanation ; I ca n't bear it ! If I see her to - night , I ca n't answer for what I may do . Curse her to all eternity ! "
99544	99547	99549	99549	Waymark	130	" Julian , "
99560	99579	99549	99549	Waymark	130	" if this goes on , you will be ill . What the deuce shall we do then ? "
99580	99600	99601	99601	He	118	" No , I shall not be ill . It will be all right if I can get sleep . "
99618	99633	99601	99601	He	118	" Waymark , is this true they say about her about the former time ? "
99634	99641	99549	99549	Waymark	130	" Yes ; it is true . "
99648	99652	99653	99653	he	118	" I suppose , "
99657	99664	99653	99653	he	118	" I owe you an apology . "
99665	99679	99601	99601	He	118	" None . It was right of you to act as you did . "
99709	99737	99692	99692	Waymark	130	" But it was in that only I misled you . Do you believe me when I repeat that she and I were never anything but friends ! "
99750	99757	99747	99747	his	118	" Yes , I believe you ! "
99758	99765	99766	99766	Waymark	130	" And be sure of this , "
99770	99811	99766	99766	Waymark	130	" whether or not this accusation is true , it does not in the least affect the nobility of her character . You and I are sufficiently honest , in the true sense of the word , to understand this . "
99956	99963	99964	99964	Julian	118	" What will become of her ! "
99968	99978	99964	99964	Julian	118	" In either case what will become of her ! "
99979	99987	99988	99988	Waymark	130	" Woodstock shall help us in that , "
99991	100001	99988	99988	Waymark	130	" She must get a place of some kind . "
100002	100018	99964	99964	Julian	118	" How dreadfully she is suffering , and how dark life will be before her ! "
100103	100123	100125	100128	the cross - examiner	2188	" You positively swear that these two articles were pledged by the prisoner , and at the same time ! "
100130	100133	100125	100128	the cross - examiner	2188	" Well , "
100139	100154	100125	100128	the cross - examiner	2188	" there 's the same date and name , and both in my writing . "
100288	100328	100244	100244	she	216	" Did you on a certain occasion go to the person in whose employ the prisoner was , and , by means of certain representations with regard to the prisoner 's antecedents , become the cause of her dismissal ? "
100329	100352	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" I did . I told all I knew about her , and I consider I 'd a right to do so . "
100372	100380	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" What led you to do this ? "
100381	100430	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" A good enough one , I think . She 'd been imposed on Mr. Casti and his wife as a respectable character , and she was causing trouble between them . She had to be got rid of somehow , and this was one step to it . "
100431	100444	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Was Mrs. Casti aware of your intention to take this step ? "
100445	100452	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" No , she was n't . "
100453	100464	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" But you told her when you had done it ? "
100465	100471	100353	100354	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Yes , I did . "
100524	100546	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Of what nature was the trouble you speak of , caused by the prisoner between this lady and her husband ? "
100547	100562	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Mr. Casti began to pay a good deal too much attention to her . "
100573	100600	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Did Mrs. Casti impart to you her suspicions of the prisoner as soon as she missed the first of these articles alleged to be stolen ? "
100601	100607	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Yes , she did . "
100608	100622	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" And did you give any advice as to how she should proceed ? "
100623	100635	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" I told her to be on the look - out . "
100636	100660	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" No doubt you laid stress on the advantage , from a domestic point of view , of securing this prisoner 's detection ? "
100661	100676	100677	100678	Mrs. Sprowl	153	" Certainly I did , and I hoped and prayed as she might caught ! "
100810	100813	100781	100781	He	118	" Guilty . "
100932	100938	100939	100939	he	1383	" Are you going in ? "
100943	100947	100923	100923	he	1383	" Are you ? "
100948	100951	100939	100939	he	1383	" Yes . "
100952	100958	100960	100960	Waymark	130	" Then I shall not , "
100962	100974	100960	100960	Waymark	130	" I 'll go to your place , and wait there . "
101038	101046	101047	101049	the old man	1383	" Why could n't you keep away ? "
101117	101124	101126	101127	Mr. Woodstock	114	" I 'm going to Tottenham , "
101129	101138	101126	101127	Mr. Woodstock	114	" You may as well come with me . "
101139	101152	101153	101153	Waymark	130	" By the by , I finished my novel the other day , "
101161	101181	101153	101153	Waymark	130	" That 's right . No doubt you 're on your way to glory , as the hymn says . "
101237	101242	101243	101244	Mr. Woodstock	114	" How 's Casti ? "
101250	101280	101243	101244	Mr. Woodstock	114	" A good deal better , I think , but shaky . Of course things will be as bad as ever when his wife comes out of the hospital . "
101281	101291	101293	101293	Abraham	115	" Pity she ca n't come out heels first , "
101347	101370	101376	101376	his	1383	" I suppose you think me an old fool to want a house like this at my time of life , eh ? "
101609	101665	101675	101675	his	130	" and nurses of the wards , had been prejudiced against him by her reports and accusations . To meet their looks occasioned him the most acute suffering . Sometimes he sat by the bedside for half an hour without speaking , then rose and hastened away to hide himself and be alone with his misery .
101690	101695	101696	101696	he	130	" It is horrible , "
101699	101728	101696	101696	he	130	" often hideous and revolting to me ; but I feel its absolute truth . Such a book will do more good than half a dozen religious societies . "
101729	101816	101675	101675	his	130	" If only people can be got to read it . Yet I care nothing for that aspect of the thing . Is it artistically strong ? Is it good as a picture ? There was a time when I might have written in this way with a declared social object . That is all gone by . I have no longer a spark of social enthusiasm . Art is all I now care for , and as art I wish my work to be judged . "
101817	101823	101825	101825	Julian	118	" One would have thought , "
101827	101843	101825	101825	Julian	118	" that increased knowledge of these fearful things would have had just the opposite effect . "
101844	101847	101849	101850	the other	449	" Yes , "
101865	102030	101849	101850	the other	449	" and so it would in the case of a man born to be a radical . I often amuse myself with taking to pieces my former self . I was not a conscious hypocrite in those days of violent radicalism , working - man's - club lecturing , and the like ; the fault was that I understood myself as yet so imperfectly . That zeal on behalf of the suffering masses was nothing more nor less than disguised zeal on behalf of my own starved passions . I was poor and desperate , life had no pleasures , the future seemed hopeless , yet I was overflowing with vehement desires , every nerve in me was a hunger which cried to be appeased . I identified myself with the poor and ignorant ; I did not make their cause my own , but my own cause theirs . I raved for freedom because I was myself in the bondage of unsatisfiable longing . "
102031	102034	102035	102035	he	2215	" Well , "
102049	102167	102035	102035	he	2215	" I have come out of all that , in proportion as my artistic self - consciousness has developed . For one thing , I am not so miserable as I was then , personally ; then again , I have found my vocation . You know pretty well the phases I have passed through . Upon ranting radicalism followed a period of philosophical study . My philosophy , I have come to see , was worth nothing ; what philosophy is worth anything ? It had its use for myself , however ; it made me by degrees self - conscious , and brought me to see that in art alone I could find full satisfaction . "
102168	102171	102173	102173	Julian	118	" Yet , "
102175	102214	102173	102173	Julian	118	" the old direction still shows itself in your choice of subjects . Granting that this is pure art , it is a kind of art only possible to an age in which the social question is predominant . "
102215	102253	102035	102035	he	2215	" True , very likely . Every strong individuality is more or less the expression of its age . This direction may be imposed upon me ; for all that , I understand why I pursue it . "
102263	102281	102257	102257	Julian	118	" Imagine yourself in my position . Could you appreciate the artistic effect of your own circumstances ? "
102282	102381	102035	102035	he	2215	" Probably not . And it is because I recognise that , that I grow more and more careful to hold aloof from situations that would threaten my peace of mind . My artistic egotism bids fair to ally itself with vulgar selfishness . That tendency I must resist . For the artist ought to be able to make material of his own sufferings , even while the suffering is at its height . To what other end does he suffer ? In very deed , he is the only man whose misery finds justification in apparent result . "
102382	102389	102391	102391	Julian	118	" I am not an artist , "
102393	102418	102035	102035	he	2215	" On the contrary , I firmly believe that you are . And it makes me angry to see the impulse dying in you . "
102419	102426	102427	102427	Julian	118	" What am I to do ? "
102437	102532	102427	102427	Julian	118	" I am so helpless , so hopelessly fettered ! Release is impossible . No words could express the desperate struggles I go through when I recognise how my life is being wasted and my powers , whatever they may be , numbed and crushed . Something I might do , if I were free ; I feel that ! But there is no hope of freedom . I shall fall into darker and darker depths of weakness and ruin , always conscious of what I am losing . What will be the end ? "
102533	102559	102035	102035	he	2215	" What the end will be , under the present circumstances , is only too clear to me . But it might easily be averted ? "
102560	102586	102427	102427	Julian	118	" How ? Give me some practical advice , Waymark ! Let us talk of the matter freely . Tell me what you would do ! "
102593	102606	102607	102607	he	130	" Does there seem any chance of her health being permanently improved ? "
102610	102646	102427	102427	Julian	118	" I ca n't say . She says she is better . It 's no use my asking the doctors ; they despise me , and would not think of treating me with any consideration . "
102647	102655	102657	102657	Waymark	130	" Why do n't you do this ? "
102663	102724	102657	102657	Waymark	130	" Use all means to find some convalescent home where she can be received when she leaves the hospital . Then , if her fits and the rest of it still continue , find some permanent place for her . You can afford it . Never mind if it reduces you for a time to a garret and a crust . "
102725	102735	102737	102737	Julian	118	" She would refuse to go to such places , "
102740	102774	102427	102427	Julian	118	" Then refuse to take her back ! Sell your furniture ; take one room for yourself ; and tell her she must live where she likes on a sufficient allowance from you . "
102775	102792	102657	102657	Waymark	130	" I dare not . It is impossible . She would never leave me in peace . "
102793	102822	102427	102427	Julian	118	" You will have to do this ultimately , if you are to continue to live . Of that there is no doubt . So why not now ? "
102823	102888	102657	102657	Waymark	130	" I must think ; it is impossible to make up my mind to such a thing at once . I know you advise what is best ; I have thought of it myself . But I shall never have the courage ! I am so miserably weak . If only I could get my health back ! Good God , how I suffer ! "
105903	105908	105909	105909	she	103	" Who is it ? "
105951	105957	105958	105958	he	130	" Do you feel better ? "
105961	105970	105958	105958	he	130	" Are you able to go on homewards ? "
105971	105975	105976	105976	she	103	" Quite able , "
105989	105999	106001	106001	Waymark	130	" What on earth is the meaning of this ? "
106006	106015	106001	106001	Waymark	130	" How came you here at this time ? "
106016	106021	106022	106022	Maud	103	" Curiosity brought me , "
106031	106038	106022	106022	Maud	103	" Had you been there long ? "
106039	106061	106001	106001	Waymark	130	" No ; I had asked my way to Litany Lane , and all at once found myself in the crowd . "
106062	106113	106022	106022	Maud	103	" Thank goodness I happened to be by ! I had just been looking up a defaulting tenant . I could n't believe my eyes when I saw you lying in that doorway . Why did n't you ask me to come with you , and show you these places ? "
106114	106121	106122	106122	she	103	" It would have been better , "
106152	106163	106164	106164	Waymark	130	" I told the man to drive to Edgware Road , "
106168	106177	106164	106164	Waymark	130	" Shall he go on to the house ? "
106178	106189	106190	106190	They	2322	" No ; I had rather walk the last part . "
106219	106229	106230	106230	she	103	" I have seen dreadful things to - night , "
106250	106250	106230	106230	she	103	"
106251	106284	106230	106230	she	103	" You give too much weight to the impressions of the moment . That world is farther removed from yours than the farthest star ; you must forget this glimpse of it . "
106285	106302	106230	106230	she	103	" Oh , I fear you do not know me ; I do not know myself . "
106321	106331	106332	106332	she	103	" Mother 's sending you a note this evening , "
106342	106366	106336	106336	she	103	" to ask you to come on Thursday instead of to - morrow . She will be from home to - morrow night . "
106367	106375	106303	106303	He	130	" Shall you also be from home ? "
106376	106381	106336	106336	she	103	" I ? No . "
106382	106399	106303	106303	He	130	" Then may I not come and see you ? Not if it would be troublesome . "
106400	106408	106336	106336	she	103	" It would not , at all . "
106409	106420	106303	106303	He	130	" It is good of you . I will come . "
106526	106535	106536	106536	he	130	" I did n't know you had Rossetti , "
106543	106549	106536	106536	he	130	" You never mentioned him . "
106550	106559	106602	106602	He	130	" I seem to have had no opportunity . "
106560	106601	106536	106536	he	130	" No . I too have many things that I have wanted to speak to you about , but opportunity was wanting . I have sometimes been on the point of asking you to let me write to you again . "
106633	106649	106650	106650	he	130	" You do not look as well as when I met you in the summer , "
106653	106680	106650	106650	he	130	" I have feared you might be studying too hard . I hope you threw away your books whilst you were at the sea - side . "
106681	106707	106621	106621	Waymark	130	" I did , but it was because I found little pleasure in them . It was not rest that took the place of reading . "
106708	106722	106723	106723	he	130	" Are your difficulties of a kind you could speak of to me ? "
106748	106812	106730	106730	She	103	" My only fear would be lest you should think my troubles unreal . Indeed it is so hard to make them appear anything more than morbid fancies . They are traceable , no doubt , to my earliest years . To explain them fully , I should have to tell you circumstances of my life which could have little interest for you . "
106813	106818	106819	106819	Waymark	130	" Tell me do , "
106823	106829	106830	106830	she	103	" Will you let me ? "
106841	106878	106838	106838	her	103	" I believe you could understand me . I have a feeling that you must have experienced something of these troubles yourself , and have overcome them . Perhaps you could help me to understand myself . "
106879	106893	106911	106911	she	103	" If I thought I could , it would give me great happiness . "
107337	107342	107343	107343	she	103	" It was long , "
107358	107492	107343	107343	she	103	" before I came to understand how differently I had been brought up from other children . Partly I began to see it at the school where we first met ; but it only grew quite clear to me when I shared in the home life of my pupils in the country . I found I had an entirely different view of the world from what was usual . That which was my evil , I discovered to be often others ' good ; and my good , their abhorrence . My aunt 's system was held to be utterly unchristian . Little things which I sometimes said , in perfect innocence , excited grave disapproval . All this frightened me , and made me even more reserved than I should have been naturally .
107493	107695	107332	107332	her	103	" In my letters to you I began to venture for the first time to speak of things which were making my life restless . I did little more than hint my opinions ; I wonder , in looking back , that I had the courage to do even that . But I already knew that your mind was broader and richer than mine , and I suppose I caught with a certain desperation at the chance of being understood . It was the first opportunity I had ever had of discussing intellectual things . With my aunt I had never ventured to discuss anything ; I reverenced her too much for that ; she spoke , and I received all she said . I thought that from you I should obtain confirmation where I needed it , but your influence was of the opposite kind . Your letters so abounded with suggestion that was quite new to me , referred so familiarly to beliefs and interests of which I was quite ignorant , showed such a boldness in judging all things , that I drifted further and further from certainty . The result of it all was that I fell ill .
107696	107780	107343	107343	she	103	" You see now what it is that has burdened me from the day when I first began to ask myself about my beliefs . I was taught to believe that the world was sin , and that the soul only freed itself from sin in proportion as it learned to live apart from and independently of the world . Everything was dark because of sin ; only in the still , secret places of the soul was the light of purity and salvation .
107781	107871	107332	107332	her	103	" I thought I had passed out of this . When I returned to London , and began this new life , the burden seemed all at once lifted from me . I could look here and there with freedom ; the sky was bright above me ; human existence was cheerful and noble and justified in itself . I began to learn a thousand things . Above all , my mind fixed on Art ; in that I thought I had found a support that would never fail me .
107872	107922	107343	107343	she	103	" Oh , why could it not last ? The clouds began to darken over me again . I heard voices once which I had hoped were for ever silenced . That sense of sin and horror came upon me last night in the streets . I suffered dreadfully . "
107952	107961	107962	107962	she	2332	" Have you any experience of such things ? "
107966	107976	107962	107962	she	2332	" Did you ever suffer in the same way ? "
107977	107984	107985	107985	he	130	" It is all very strange , "
107993	108035	107985	107985	he	130	" This overpowering consciousness of sin is an anachronism in our time . But , from the way in which you express yourself , I should have thought you had been studying Schopenhauer . I suppose you know nothing of him ? "
108036	108039	107930	107930	Waymark	130	" Nothing . "
108040	108167	107985	107985	he	130	" Some of your phrases were precisely his . Your doctrine is simply Pessimism , with an element of dogmatic faith added . With Schopenhauer , the will to live is the root of sin ; mortify this , deny the first instincts of your being , and you approach righteousness . Buddhism has the same system . And , in deducing all this from the plain teachings of Christianity , I am disposed to think you are right and consistent . Christianity is pessimism , so far as this world is concerned ; we see that in such things as the thanksgiving for a ' person 's death in the burial service , and the prayer that the end of the world may soon come . "
108177	108182	108183	108183	he	2333	" But all this , "
108202	108516	108183	108183	he	2333	" is of course , with me , mere matter of speculation . There are two allegories , which define Pessimism and Optimism . First that of Adam and Christ . Adam falls through eating of the tree of knowledge ; in other words , sin only comes with self - consciousness , sin is the conscious enjoyment of life . And , according to this creed , it can only be overcome by abnegation , by the denial of the will to live . Accordingly , Christ enters the world , and , representing Humanity , as Adam had done , saves the world by denial , of Himself , even to death . The other allegory is that of Prometheus . He also represents mankind , and his stealing of the fire means man 's acquirement of a conscious soul , whereby he makes himself capable of sin . The gods put him in bondage and torment , representing the subjection to the flesh . But Prometheus is saved in a different way from Adam ; not by renunciation , but by the prowess of Hercules , that is to say , the triumphant aspiration of Humanity . Man triumphs by asserting his right to do so . Self - consciousness he claims as a good thing , and embraces the world as his birthright . Here , you see , there is no room for the crushing sense of sin . Sin , if anything , is weakness . Let us rejoice in our strength , whilst we have it . The end of course will come , but it is a wise man 's part not to heed the inevitable . Let us live whilst it is called to - day ; we shall go to sleep with all the better conscience for having used the hours of daylight . "
108523	108528	108529	108529	Waymark	130	" My own temperament , "
108533	108766	108529	108529	Waymark	130	" is , I suppose , exceptional , at all events among men who have an inner life . I never knew what goes by the name of religious feeling ; impulses of devotion , in the common sense of the phrase , have always been strange to me . I have known fear at the prospect of death ; religious consolation , never . Sin , above all , has been a word without significance to me . As a boy , it was so ; it is so still , now that I am self - conscious . I have never been a deep student of philosophy , but the doctrine of philosophical necessity , the idea of Fate , is with me an instinct . I know that I could not have acted otherwise than I did in any juncture of my life ; I know that the future is beyond my control . I shall do this , and avoid that , simply owing to a preponderance of motives , which I can gauge , but not control . Certain things I hate and shrink from ; but I try to avoid , even in thought , such words as vice and crime ; the murderer could not help himself , and the saint has no merit in his sanctity . Does all this seem horrible to you ? "
108819	108972	108813	108813	Waymark	130	" You will not think me incapable of what we call noble thought and feeling ? I have in me the elements of an enthusiast ; they might have led me to strange developments , but for that cold , critical spirit which makes me so intensely self - conscious . This restless scepticism has often been to me a torment in something the same way as that burden of which you speak . Often , often , I would so gladly surrender myself to my instincts of passion and delight . I may change ; I may perhaps some day attain rest in an absolute ideal . If I do , it will be through the help of one who shall become to me that ideal personified , who shall embody all the purer elements of my nature , and speak to me as with the voice of my own soul . "
108997	109004	109005	109005	he	2336	" I have spoken to you , "
109015	109082	109005	109005	he	2336	" with a sincerity which was the due return for your own . I could have shown myself in a more pleasing light . You see how little able I am to help you ; the centre - thought of your being is wholly strange to me . And for all that may I speak my thought ? we are nearer to each other than before . "
109083	109088	109089	109089	she	2335	" Yes , nearer , "
109096	109111	109005	109005	he	2336	" You think that ? You feel that ? I have not repelled you ? "
109112	109116	109005	109005	he	2336	" You have not "
109117	109225	109005	109005	he	2336	" And if I stood before you , now , as you know me egotistic , sceptical , calm and told you that you are the only being in whom I have ever felt complete confidence , whose word and thought I felt to be one ; that you exercise more power over me than any other ever did or shall ; that life in your companionship might gain the unity I long for ; that in your presence I feel myself face to face with a higher and nobler nature than my own , one capable of sustaining me in effort and leading me to great results "
109269	109275	109276	109276	Waymark	130	" You are not afraid , "
109279	109346	109276	109276	Waymark	130	" to link your fate with mine ? My life is made up of uncertainties . I have no position ; it may be a long time before I can see even the promise of success in my work . I have chosen that work , however , and by it I stand or fall . Have you sufficient faith in me to wait with confidence ? "
109347	109386	109262	109262	she	2338	" I have absolute faith in you . I ask no greater happiness than to have a share in your aims . It will give me the strength I need , and make my life full of hope . "

111008	111011	111003	111003	he	491	" Well ? "

111060	111063	111003	111003	he	491	" Well ? "

111094	111111	111003	111003	he	491	" 'Cos I ai n't , and 'cos I 'm tired o ' payin ' rent . "
111112	111128	111130	111130	Waymark	130	" I 'm afraid you 'll find it difficult to get on without , though , "

111230	111240	111209	111209	he	156	" Do you believe in the devil and hell ? "
111241	111244	111246	111246	Waymark	130	" Why ? "
111273	111333	111334	111334	Waymark	130	" 'Cos , by the devil himself , as 'll have me before many weeks is over , and by the fires of hell , as 'll burn me , if you stir a step , or speak a word above your breath , I 'll bring you down just like they do the bullocks . Y ' understand ! "
111375	111495	111354	111354	Slimy	156	" It takes you back a bit , do n't it ! Never mind ; you 'll get over it . I do n't mean you no ' arm , Mr. Waymark , but I 'll have to put you to a little ill - convenience , that 's all . See now ; here 's a bit o ' stout rope . With this ' ere , I 'm a - goin' jist to tie you up , ' and an ' foot , you see . As I said before , if you give me any trouble , well , I 'll ' ave to knock the senses out o ' you fust , that 's all . "
111613	111616	111618	111618	Slimy	156	" Now , "
111625	111661	111618	111618	Slimy	156	" I have to arst you just to lay down on the floor , just ' ere , see . It 's better to lay down quiet than to be knocked down , you see . "
111988	111994	111995	111995	he	130	" Now , Mr. Waymark , "
112008	112080	111995	111995	he	130	" I ai n't quite done with ill - conveniencin ' you . I 'm sorry to say I 'll ' ave jist to put a bit of a gag on , to prevent you from ' ollerin ' out too soon ; but before I do that , I 've jist got a word or two to say . Let 's spend our last time together in a friendly way . "
112210	112222	112223	112223	he	156	" I do n't rightly know how old I may be , "
112228	112394	112223	112223	he	156	" but it 's most like about fifty ; we 'll say fifty . For fifty years I 've lived in this world , and in all that time I ca n't remember not one single ' appy day , not one . I never knowed neither father nor mother ; I never knowed not a soul as belonged to me . Friends I ' ave had ; four of 'em ; and their names was Brandy , Whisky , Rum , an ' Gin . But they 've cost me a good deal , an ' somehow they ai n't quite what they used to be . They used to make me merry for a while , now and then ; but they 've taken now to burnin ' up my inside , an ' filling my ' ead with devils ; an ' I 'm gettin ' afeard of 'em , an ' they 'll ' ave to see me through to the end .

' The reason is , 'cos I ai n't never ' ad money . Money means ' appiness , an ' them as never ' as money , 'll never be ' appy , live as long as they may . Well , I went on a - sayin ' to myself , ' Ai n't I to ' ave not one ' appy day in all my life ?

There 's a good deal more than five pound ' ere now , Mr. Waymark ; I 've reckoned it up in my ' cad . What d ' you think I 'm a - goin' for to do with it ? "
112673	112680	112681	112681	he	2388	" I 'm a - goin' , "

117071	117085	117068	117068	Julian	118	" that something is wrong . Surely it 's time to make inquiries . "
117086	117120	117121	117122	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Yes , yes ; I will do so . But you look downright ill . Do you feel able to get home ? If I 'd thought it would upset you like this "
117134	117145	117146	117146	Julian	118	" I shall go home and have a little rest , "
117149	117170	117146	117146	Julian	118	" I did n't get much sleep last night , that 's all . But I must hear about Waymark . "
117171	117218	117247	117248	a woman	3216	" You shall . I 'll warrant he turns up in the course of the day . Do n't be anxious : I 'll get to work as soon as possible to find him ; but , depend upon it , the fellow 's all right . "
117266	117279	117280	117280	he	233	" I 'll just have a cup of coffee , Mrs. Sims , "
117283	117293	117280	117280	he	233	" Does she seem to care for her breakfast ? "
117294	117311	117247	117248	a woman	3216	" I 'm afraid not , sir ; she looks tired out , and poorly like . "
117312	117368	117280	117280	he	233	" Yes , yes ; the long journey and her troubles . Make her as comfortable as you can . I 'll make myself at home with the paper here for an hour or so . Just see if she cares to lie down for a little ; If so I wo n't disturb her . "
117596	117600	117602	117603	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Very well , "
117607	117627	117602	117603	Mr. Woodstock	233	" I 'll go to the office . Send some one round when she 's stirring , will you ? "
118209	118218	118219	118220	the landlady	386	" Do you feel better , ' m ? "
118223	118229	118219	118220	the landlady	386	" Have you rested yourself ? "
118230	118236	118259	118259	him	233	" Yes , thank you . "
118281	118289	118290	118290	Abraham	115	" Have you any recollection of me ? "
118363	118369	118370	118370	she	101	" You are Abraham Woodstock , "
118397	118428	118370	118370	she	101	" Yes , I am . And I am a friend of Osmond Waymark . I should like to talk a little with you , if you 'll let me . "
118471	118482	118483	118483	she	101	" How can you be a friend of Osmond Waymark ? "
118490	118501	118483	118483	she	101	" Did n't he ever mention my name to you ? "
118502	118505	118483	118483	she	101	" Never . "
118571	118584	118585	118585	he	233	" I have known him all his life , for all that , "
118588	118598	118585	118585	he	233	" And it was through him I found you . "
118599	118603	118585	118585	he	233	" Found me ? "
118604	118646	118585	118585	he	233	" It 'll seem very strange , what I have to tell you . You were a little girl when I saw you last , and you refused to come with me . Had you any idea why I asked you ? "
118647	118653	118585	118585	he	233	" I had n't then . "
118654	118663	118585	118585	he	233	" But you have thought of it since ? "
118696	118702	118703	118703	Abraham	115	" I am your grandfather , "
118707	118714	118703	118703	Abraham	115	" Your mother was my daughter . "
118729	118737	118738	118738	he	233	" Who did you think I was ? "
118755	118764	118741	118741	She	101	" You behaved cruelly to my poor mother . "
118765	118772	118773	118775	the old man	1383	" I wo n't deny it , "
118784	118819	118779	118779	his	1383	" I ought to have been more patient with her . But she refused to obey me , and I ca n't help my nature . I repented it when it was too late . "
118853	118862	118863	118864	Mr. Woodstock	233	" I ca n't do anything for her , "
118875	118921	118863	118864	Mr. Woodstock	233	" But you are her child , and I want to do now what I ought to have done long ago . I 've come here to ask you if you 'll live in my house , and be like a child of my own . "
118922	118934	118935	118935	Ida	101	" I do n't feel to you as a child ought , "
118944	118952	118935	118935	Ida	101	" You 've left it too late . "
118953	118962	118964	118965	the other	449	" No , it is n't too late ! "
118974	119023	118964	118965	the other	449	" You must n't think of yourself , but of me . You have all your life before you , but I 'm drawing near to the end of mine . There 's no one in the world belonging to me but you . I have a right to "
119024	119031	119032	119032	Ida	101	" No right ! no right ! "
119038	119045	119047	119047	Abraham	115	" Then you have a duty , "
119053	119128	119047	119047	Abraham	115	" My mind is n't at ease , and it 's in your power to help me . Do n't imitate me , and put off doing good till it is too late . I do n't ask you to feel kindly to me ; all I want is that you 'll let me take you to my home and do all I can for you , both now and after I 'm gone . "
119141	119152	119153	119153	she	101	" Do you know where I came from this morning ? "
119165	119187	119284	119284	Abraham	115	" I know all about it . I was at the trial , and I did my best for you then . "
119188	119198	119199	119199	Ida	101	" Do you believe that I robbed that woman ? "
119211	119246	119284	119284	Abraham	115	" Believe it ! Not I ! No one believes it who knows anything about her . Waymark said he would n't have believed it if all the courts in England found you guilty . "
119247	119252	119253	119253	she	101	" He said that ? "
119267	119283	119253	119253	she	101	" Where is Mr. Waymark ? Why did n't he meet me as he promised ? "
119303	119342	119353	119353	She	101	" I know as little as you do . He ought to have come to me yesterday , but he did n't , and I ca n't discover him . I got Mr. Casti to meet you instead . "
119374	119382	119383	119383	she	101	" Have you been through the houses ? "
119394	119406	119383	119383	she	101	" Have n't you thought that he may have been robbed and "
119421	119435	119437	119439	the old man	1383	" Come , come , it is n't so bad as all that , "
119445	119498	119437	119439	the old man	1383	" He may turn up at any moment ; all sorts of unexpected things may have happened . But I 'll go again to his lodgings , and if I ca n't hear anything there , I 'll set the police to work . Will you promise me to wait here quietly ? "
119499	119529	119437	119439	the old man	1383	" No , that I ca n't do . I want to move about ; I must do something . Let me go with you to look for him . "
119530	119542	119437	119439	the old man	1383	" No , no ; that 'll never do , Ida . "
119564	119567	119561	119561	his	1383	" Ida , "
119582	119608	119563	119563	her	101	" Let me , let me go with you ! I will forget everything I will be your child I will try to love you . "
119654	119660	119661	119661	she	101	" We are losing time ! "
119672	119677	119661	119661	she	101	" Come at once . "
119859	119867	119868	119868	he	130	" Are you strong enough for this ? "
119872	119887	119868	119868	he	130	" Had n't you better go back to the cab and wait for me ! "
119888	119897	119898	119898	she	101	" Do n't ask me to do that ! "
119902	119915	119898	119898	she	101	" I must be active . I have strength now for anything . "
120016	120020	120033	120033	he	2507	" Lushy Dick , "
120095	120100	120101	120102	the tobacconist	2508	" Arf a quid ! "
120107	120126	120101	120102	the tobacconist	2508	" I 'd like to know where such as you 's likely to git arf a quid from . "
120148	120218	120101	120102	the tobacconist	2508	" Would yer like to know , y ' old ! Then yer shall , soon ! I 'm if I do n't tell jist the truth , an ' take the consequences . It was Slimy as give it me , an ' if yer want to know where Slimy got it , yer 'll ' ave to well find out , 'cos I do n't know myself . "
120219	120231	120232	120233	Mr. Woodstock	233	" And how came Slimy to give you half a sovereign ? "
120242	120250	120252	120253	the boy	693	" Is that you , Mr. Woodstock ? "
120265	120322	120252	120253	the boy	693	" Now , look ' ere , I 'm a - goin' to make a clean breast of it . This ' ere bloke 's been a ringin ' the changes on me ; I 'll show him up , an ' well chance it . Slimy give me a quid afore he took his hook . "
120372	120495	120364	120365	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Why Slimy give it me ? Well , I 'll jist tell yer , Mr. Woodstock . It was to do a job for him , which I never done it after all . Slimy told me as ' ow I was to go to your orffice at ten o'clock last night , ' an tell you from him as he 'd no more ' casion for his room , so he 'd sent yer the key , an ' yer'd better come as soon as possible an ' see as he 'd left everything square behind him , an ' 'cos he was afraid he 'd locked in a friend o ' yourn by mistake an ' in his hurry . "
120496	120506	120508	120508	Abraham	115	" And why the devil did n't you come ? "
120517	120585	120508	120508	Abraham	115	" 'Cos why , Mr. Woodstock ? Well , I 'll tell yer just the bloomin ' truth , an ' charnce it . I loss the key out o ' my pocket , through ' avin ' a hole in it , so I thought as ' ow I 'd best just say nothink about neither Slimy nor his room , an ' there y'ave it ! "
120597	120603	120604	120604	he	2514	" I 've found him , "
120609	120618	120604	120604	he	2514	" A house round there in the court . "
120861	120866	120867	120867	she	101	" He is alive ! "
120870	120883	120867	120867	she	101	" His eyes have opened . A knife ! Cut these cords ! "
120984	120990	120991	120991	he	130	" Who is touching me ? "
120998	121009	120991	120991	he	130	" It is all dark . Whose hand is this ? "
121010	121015	121016	121016	Abraham	115	" It 's Ida , "
121025	121037	121016	121016	Abraham	115	" She and I have had a rare hunt for you . "
121038	121041	121059	121059	her	101	" Ida ? "
121116	121317	121322	121323	Mr. Woodstock	233	" The man wanted on a charge of robbery with violence in the East End , and who appears to be known only by the nickname of Slimy , was yesterday afternoon discovered by the police in a cellar in Limehouse . He seems to have been in hiding there since the perpetration of the crime , only going out from time to time to purchase liquor at public - houses in the neighbourhood . Information given by the landlord of one of these houses led to his arrest . He was found lying on the stone floor , with empty bottles about him , also a quantity of gold and silver coins , which appeared to have rolled out of his pocket . He was carried to the police - station in an insensible state , but on being taken to the cell , came to himself , and exhibited symptoms of delirium tremens . Two officers remained with him , but the assistance of a third shortly became necessary , owing to the violence of his struggles . Towards midnight his fury lessened , and , after a very brief interval of unconsciousness , the wretched creature expired . "
121818	121821	121822	121822	she	101	" Grandfather , "
121852	121862	121863	121863	he	233	" Are you better for the sleep , Ida ? "
121873	121884	121835	121835	she	101	" Much ; much better . How the sun shines ! "
121885	121905	121835	121835	she	101	" Yes , it 's a fine day . Do n't you think you could go out a little ? "
121906	121926	121835	121835	she	101	" I think I should like to , but I ca n't walk very far , I 'm afraid . "
121927	121950	121835	121835	she	101	" You need n't walk at all , my dear . Your carriage shall be here whenever you like to order it . "
121951	121955	121835	121835	she	101	" My carriage ? "
121975	121981	121983	121983	her	101	" How is Mr. Waymark ? "
121987	122029	121835	121835	she	101	" Nothing much amiss now , I think . His eyes are painful , he says , and he must n't leave the room yet , but it wo n't last much longer . Shall we go together and see him ? "
122043	122058	122030	122030	She	101	" But you 'll go out , Ida , if I order the carriage ? "
122059	122068	122030	122030	She	101	" Thank you , I should like to . "
122229	122242	122243	122243	he	2550	" I shall be able to go for the rents next Monday , "
122251	122272	122243	122243	he	2550	" I should have thought you 'd had enough of that . I 've found another man for the job . "
122273	122283	122284	122284	Waymark	130	" Then what on earth am I to do ? "
122288	122305	122284	122284	Waymark	130	" How am I to get my living if you take that work away from me ? "
122306	122315	122316	122316	Abraham	115	" Never mind ; we 'll find something , "
122319	122337	122316	122316	Abraham	115	" Why are you in such a hurry to get away , I should like to know ? "
122338	122353	122316	122316	Abraham	115	" Simply because I ca n't always live here , and I hate uncertainty . "
122417	122425	122426	122426	Abraham	115	" Do you feel able to talk ? "
122432	122437	122409	122409	his	818	" Yes . Why ? "
122438	122478	122409	122409	his	818	" Because I want to ask you a few questions . I 've just had a call from that friend of yours , Mr. Enderby , and something came out in talk that I was n't exactly prepared for . "
122485	122493	122495	122496	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Why did n't you tell me , "
122498	122507	122495	122496	Mr. Woodstock	233	" that you were engaged to his daughter ? "
122508	122515	122409	122409	his	818	" I scarcely thought it necessary . "
122516	122526	122495	122496	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Not when I told you who Ida was ? "
122589	122600	122601	122601	Waymark	130	" I do n't see that it made any difference , "
122641	122648	122649	122650	the latter	425	" Why did Mr. Enderby call ? "
122653	122686	122649	122650	the latter	425	" Very naturally , it seems to me , to know what had become of you . He did n't see the report in the paper , and went searching for you . "
122687	122694	122695	122695	he	1383	" Does Ida know of this ? "
122719	122751	122709	122709	his	130	" I have never told her . Why should I have done ? Perhaps now you will believe what I insisted upon before the trial , that there had been nothing whatever "
122767	122791	122649	122650	the latter	425	" Never mention that again to me as long as you live , Waymark If you do , we shall quarrel , understand ! "
122792	122806	122808	122808	Waymark	130	" I have no more pleasure in referring to it than you have , "
122813	122824	122808	122808	Waymark	130	" but I must justify myself when you attack me . "
122825	122834	122836	122837	the other	449	" How long has this been going on ? "
122843	122850	122649	122650	the latter	425	" Some three months perhaps more . "
122851	122900	122808	122808	Waymark	130	" Well , I think it would have been better if you 'd been straightforward about it , that 's all . I do n't know that I 've anything more to say . We know what we 're about , and there 's an end of it . "
123351	123362	123363	123363	she	101	" This will of course only be for a time ? "
123374	123380	123381	123381	Abraham	115	" I do n't know , "
123385	123399	123381	123381	Abraham	115	" I should think it will suit him as well as anything else . "
123400	123422	123381	123381	Abraham	115	" But he is clever ; he writes books . Do n't you think he will make himself known some day ? "
123423	123454	123381	123381	Abraham	115	" That kind of thing is n't much to be depended on , it seems to me . It 's a doubtful business to look forward to for a living . "
124179	124184	124185	124185	he	233	" Do you remember , "
124188	124198	124185	124185	he	233	" once offering to buy those shares of mine ? "
124199	124205	124207	124208	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Yes , I do , "
124214	124222	124211	124211	his	233	" Does the offer still hold good ? "
124223	124235	124185	124185	he	233	" Yes , yes ; if you 're anxious to realise . "
124236	124247	124211	124211	his	233	" I am . I want money for two purposes . "
124248	124253	124254	124254	Abraham	115	" What are they ? "
124258	124351	124211	124211	his	233	" One is a private matter , which I do n't think I need speak of ; but the other I can explain . I have found a courageous publisher who has offered to bring my book out if I take a certain risk . This I have made up my mind to do . I want to get the thing out , if only for the sake of hearing Mrs. Grundy lift up her voice ; and if it ca n't be otherwise , I must publish at my own expense . "
124352	124358	124359	124360	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Will it repay you ? "
124363	124381	124211	124211	his	233	" Ultimately , I have no doubt ; but I do n't care so much about that . "
124382	124409	124211	124211	his	233	" H'm . I should think that 's the chief matter to be considered . And you wo n't tell me what the other speculation is ? "
124410	124431	124211	124211	his	233	" I 'm going to lend a friend some money , but I do n't wish to go into detail . "
124440	124444	124445	124445	he	1383	" Very well , "
124449	124475	124445	124445	he	1383	" I 'll let you have the cash . Could you manage to look in at the office to - morrow at mid - day ? "
124495	124501	124502	124502	he	1383	" As we 're talking , "
124505	124532	124502	124502	he	1383	" I may as well have over something that 's on my mind . Why have n't you told Ida yet about that engagement of yours ? "
124533	124540	124541	124541	Waymark	130	" Have n't you done so ? "
124547	124554	124502	124502	he	1383	" Did you think I had ? "
124555	124563	124502	124502	he	1383	" Why , yes , I did . "
124564	124573	124574	124574	Abraham	115	" I 've done nothing of the kind , "
124599	124605	124606	124607	the other	449	" Do n't you think , "
124610	124621	124606	124607	the other	449	" it 's about time something was said to her ? "
124622	124632	124574	124574	Abraham	115	" I ca n't see that it matters , and "
124633	124658	124606	124607	the other	449	" But I can see . As long as that is n't known you 're here , to speak plainly , on false pretences . "
124659	124669	124574	124574	Abraham	115	" Then I wo n't come here at all ! "
124670	124674	124676	124678	the old man	1383	" Very good , "
124691	124691	124685	124685	you	130	"
124717	124723	124724	124724	he	1383	" Now , look here , "
124727	124747	124724	124724	he	1383	" there 's something in all this I ca n't make out . Is this engagement a serious one ? "
124748	124751	124753	124754	the other	449	" Serious ? "
124762	124769	124753	124754	the other	449	" How can it be otherwise ? "
124770	124803	124713	124713	his	1383	" Very well ; in that case you 're bound to let Ida know about it , and at once . Damn it all , do n't you know your own mind ? "
124812	124987	124753	124754	the other	449	" I , of course , understand why you press so for this explanation . You take it for granted that Ida regards me as something more than a friend . If so , my manner since she has been here must have clearly shown her that , on my side , I have not the least thought of offering more than friendship . You yourself will grant so much , I believe . For all that , I do n't deny that our relations have always been unusual ; and it would cost me very much to tell her of my engagement . I ask you to relieve me of the painful task , on the understanding that I never come here again . I ca n't make you understand my position . You say my behaviour has not been straightforward . In the ordinary sense of the word it has not ; there let it rest . Tell Ida what you will of me , and let me disappear from her world . "
124988	124996	124998	124998	Abraham	115	" The plain English of all which , "
125001	125043	124998	124998	Abraham	115	" is , that , as far as you are concerned , you would be quite willing to let the girl live on false hopes , just to have the pleasure of her society as long as you care for it . "
125044	125097	125115	125116	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Not so , not so at all ! I value Ida 's friendship as I value that of no other woman , and I am persuaded that , if I were free with her , I could reconcile her entirely to our connection remaining one of friendship , and nothing more . "
125249	125252	125253	125253	he	1000	" Faith , "
125256	125469	125253	125253	he	1000	" I 'd have given a trifle if ye could have heard the conversation between Tootle and me , just after breakfast yesterday . The boys were filing out of the room , when , ' Mr. O'Gree ! ' cries Pendy . ' Sir ! ' I reply . ' The boys were called late this morning , I hear . ' ' No such thing , sir , ' I assure ' um . ' Half - past six to the minute , by my watch . ' ' Oh , your watch , Mr. O'Gree , ' cries the old reprobate . ' I fear your watch does n't keep very good time . ' ' Sure , you 're in the right , sir , ' said I ; ' it 's been losing a little of late ; so only last night I stopped it at half - past six , to make sure it would show me the right calling - time this morning . ' And , when I 'd said that , I just nod my head , as much as to say , ' There 's one for ye , me boy ! ' and walk off as jaunty as a Limerick bantam . "
125489	125500	125501	125501	he	142	" I 'm resolved , Waymark , I 'm resolved ! "
125504	125554	125501	125501	he	142	" At midsummer I break my chains , and stand erect in the dignity of a free man . I 've said it often , but now I mean it . Sally urges me to do ut , and Sally never utters a worrud that is n't pure wisdom . "
125555	125588	125478	125478	O'Gree	142	" Well , I think she 's right . I myself should prefer a scavenger 's existence , on the whole . But have you thought any further of the other scheme ? "
125589	125731	125501	125501	he	142	" The commercial undertaking ? We were talking it over the other night . Sally says : Borrow the money and risk ut . And I think she 's in the right . If you enter the world of commerce , you must be prepared for speculation . We looked over the advertisements in a newspaper , just to get an idea , and we calculated the concern could be set afloat for seventy - five pounds . Out of that we could pay a quarter 's rent , and stock the shop . Sally 's been behind the counter a good bit of late , and she 's getting an insight into that kind of thing . Wonderful girl , Sally ! Put her in Downing Street for a week , and she 'd be competent to supplant the Premier ! "
125732	125741	125478	125478	O'Gree	142	" You have decided for a chandler 's ? "
125742	125887	125501	125501	he	142	" Yes ; we neither of us know much about tobacco , and tobacco perhaps is n't quits the thing for a man of education . But to be a chandler is something worthy of any man 's ambition . You supply at once the solids and the luxuries of life ; you range from boiled ham and pickles to mixed biscuits and preserves . You are the focus of a whole street . The father comes to you for his mid - day bread and cheese , the mother for her half - ounce of tea , the child for its farthing's - worth of sweets . For years I 've been leading a useless life ; once let me get into my shop , and I become a column of the social system . Faith , it 's as good as done ! "
125888	125897	125478	125478	O'Gree	142	" From whom shall you borrow the cash ? "
125898	125940	125501	125501	he	142	" Sally 's going to think about that point . I suppose we shall go to a loan office , and make some kind of arrangement . I 'm rather vague on these things , but Sally will find it out . "
125941	125945	125947	125947	Waymark	130	" I understand , "
125962	125962	125954	125954	you	130	"
125963	125982	125501	125501	he	142	" As serious as I was in the moment of my birth ! There 's no other chance . "
125983	125998	125954	125954	you	130	" Very well , then , suppose I offer to lend you the money . "
125999	126004	125501	125501	he	142	" You , Waymark ? "
126005	126011	125954	125954	you	130	" No less a person . "
126046	126053	126055	126055	O'Gree	142	" Ye mean it , Waymark ! "
126064	126131	126055	126055	O'Gree	142	" Bedad , you are a man and a brother , and no mistake ! Ye're the first that ever offered to lend me a penny ; ye're the first that ever had faith in me ! You shall come with me to see Sally on Saturday , and tell her this yourself , and I should n't be surprised if she gives you a kiss ! "
126157	126276	126132	126132	O'Gree	142	" We 'll take a shop in a new neighbourhood , where we shall have the monopoly . The people 'll get to know Sally ; she 'll be like a magnet behind the counter . I shall go to the wholesale houses , and impress them with a sense of my financial stability ; I flatter myself I shall look the prosperous shopkeeper , eh ? Who knows what we may come to ? Why , in a few years we may transfer our business to Oxford Street or Piccadilly , and call ourselves Italian warehousemen ; and bedad , we 'll turn out in the end another Crosse and Blackwell , see if we do n't ! "
126309	126312	126313	126313	he	2604	" Faith , "
126324	126436	126313	126313	he	2604	" who d'ye think I saw last Sunday ? As I was free in the afternoon , I took a walk , and , coming back , I went into a little coffee - shop for a cup of tea . A man in an apron came up to serve me , and , by me soul , if it was n't poor old Egger ! I 've heard not a word of him since he left last Christmas . He was ashamed of himself , poor devil ; but I did my best to make him easy . After all , he 's better off than in the scholastic line . "
127209	127239	127194	127194	He	203	" Have you noticed anything a little a little strange in your mother lately , Maud ? Anything in her way of speaking , I mean her general manner ? "
127269	127279	127280	127280	Paul	203	" She has very bad nights , you know , "
127293	127349	127280	127280	Paul	203	" and of late she has been taking chloral . It 's against my wish , but the relief makes it an irresistible temptation . I fear I am afraid it is having some deleterious effect upon her ; she seemed to be a little just a little delirious in the night , I thought . "
127395	127401	127402	127402	Paul	203	" I thought , also , "
127406	127431	127402	127402	Paul	203	" that she appeared a little strange last evening , when the people were here . You were n't in the drawing - room ? "
127438	127445	127446	127446	he	203	" Do you do you think , "
127489	127489	127482	127482	You	103	"
127490	127501	127503	127504	the girl	316	" No , no ; it is necessary to her , "
127507	127510	127511	127512	her father	514	" But , "
127520	127558	127511	127512	her father	514	" there is always the danger lest she should over - exert herself . Last night I I thought I noticed but it was scarcely worth speaking of ; I am so easily alarmed , you know . "
127569	127579	127581	127582	her father	514	" You you wo n't desert her quite Maud ? "
127589	127625	127581	127582	her father	514	" I am obliged to be so muck away God knows I ca n't help it . And then I I wonder whether you have noticed ? I seem to have little influence with her . "
127643	127670	127634	127634	himself	514	" Ca n't you help me a little more , Maud ? Could n't you induce her to live a little more more restfully at times ? "
127681	127688	127689	127689	she	103	" Father , I ca n't ! "
127700	127705	127706	127707	her father	514	" God help us ! "
128139	128147	128148	128148	Maud	103	" Will you let me sit here ? "
128170	128178	128179	128179	she	103	" When will they begin the printing ? "
128201	128217	128179	128179	she	103	" Not for some months . It ca n't come out till the winter season . "
128218	128238	128179	128179	she	103	" If it should succeed , it will make a great difference in your position , wo n't it ? "
128239	128243	128244	128244	he	130	" It might , "
128270	128279	128280	128280	Waymark	130	" I do n't much count upon it , "
128292	128302	128280	128280	Waymark	130	" We must n't base any hopes on that . "
128315	128320	128321	128321	Maud	103	" Must you go ? "
128382	128387	128388	128388	he	130	" Good - bye , "
128446	128452	128443	128443	her	103	" Do you love me ? "
129442	129450	129451	129451	Maud	103	" Do I disturb you , father ? "
129454	129463	129451	129451	Maud	103	" Could you spare me a few minutes ? "
129475	129492	129468	129468	she	103	" Father , I am going to leave home , going to be a governess again . "
129534	129542	129543	129543	he	203	" You will desert me , Maud ? "
129561	129581	129519	129519	he	203	" Father , I can be of no help , and I feel that I must not remain here . "
129582	129589	129626	129626	Paul	203	" Have you found a place ? "
129590	129625	129519	129519	he	203	" This afternoon I engaged myself to go to Paris with a French family . They have been in England some time , and want to take back an English governess for their children . "
129630	129640	129641	129641	she	2690	" I leave the day after to - morrow , "
129658	129663	129664	129665	her father	514	" You are right , "
129677	129692	129664	129665	her father	514	" You are right to leave us . You at least will be safe . "
129693	129696	129697	129697	she	2690	" Safe ? "
129718	129721	129722	129722	she	2690	" Father , "
129736	129752	129722	129722	she	2690	" can you not go away from here ? Can you not take mother away ? "
129807	129816	129817	129819	the wretched man	2696	" I ca n't , I ca n't ! "
129830	129872	129824	129824	his	2696	" Perhaps in a few months but I doubt . I can do nothing now ; I am helpless ; I am not my own master . O God , if I could but go and leave it all behind me ! "
129927	129933	129934	129934	Paul	203	" You fear for her ? "
129938	129945	129946	129946	He	203	" You have noticed her strangeness ? "
129951	129959	129948	129948	his	203	" What can I do , Maud ? "
129960	129967	129968	129968	she	103	" You are so much away , "
129979	129987	129968	129968	she	103	" Her visitors she has so many temptations "
129988	129991	129948	129948	his	203	" Temptations ? "
129992	130000	129968	129968	she	103	" Father , help her against herself ! "
130001	130030	129948	129948	his	203	" My help is vain . There is a curse on her life , and on mine . I can only stand by and wait for the worst . "
130341	130345	130346	130346	she	103	" I hope , "
130351	130425	130346	130346	she	103	" that you will see my father as often as you can ; he is very much in need of friendly company , and I should like you to be able to send me news of him . Do not fear for me ; I feel already better . I am always with you in spirit , and in the spirit I love you ; God help me to keep my love pure ! "
130954	130957	130958	130958	she	101	" Grandfather , "
130966	130981	130958	130958	she	101	" will you let me give a garden - party some day next week ? "
130982	130986	130987	130988	Mr. Woodstock	233	" A party ? "
130995	131003	130958	130958	she	101	" Who are you going to invite ? "
131004	131095	130987	130988	Mr. Woodstock	233	" You 'll think it a strange notion . I wonder whether I can make it seem as delightful to you as it does to me . Suppose we went to those houses of yours , and got together as many poor little girls as we could , and brought them all here to spend an afternoon in the garden . Think what an unheard - of thing it would be to them ! And then we would give them some tea , and take them back again before dark . "
131121	131132	131133	131133	he	233	" As you say , it 's a strange notion , "
131140	131170	131133	131133	he	233	" I do n't know why you should n't have your own way , Ida , but it 'll cost you a good deal of trouble , you know . "
131171	131233	131234	131234	Her	2708	" You are mistaking me , grandfather . You think this a curious whim I have got into my head , and your kindness would tempt you to let me do a silly thing just for the sake of having my way . It is no foolish fancy . It 's not for my sake , but for the children 's . "
131246	131256	131265	131265	her	2708	" Do you think they 'd care for it ? "
131273	131367	131234	131234	Her	2708	" Care for it ! Imagine a poor little thing that has been born in a wretched , poverty - stricken , disorderly home , a home that is no home , and growing up with no knowledge of anything but those four hateful walls and the street outside . No toys , no treats , no change of air ; playing in the gutter , never seeing a beautiful thing , never hearing of the pleasures which rich people 's children would pine and die without And a child for all that . "
131381	131391	131371	131371	his	233	" How will you get them here , Ida ? "
131392	131498	131371	131371	his	233	" Oh , leave that to me ! Let us choose a day ; would n't Saturday be best ! I will go there myself , and pick out the children , and get their mothers to promise to have them ready . Then I 'll arrange to have one of those carts you see at Sunday - school treats . Why , the ride here , that alone ! And you 'll let me have tea for them , just bread and butter and a bun , it will cost not half as much as my new dress this week , not half as much "
131499	131510	131513	131513	Abraham	115	" Come , come , I ca n't stand this ! "
131521	131559	131513	131513	Abraham	115	" I 'd give them the garden , for good and all , rather than see you like that . Say Saturday , if it 's fine ; if not , Monday , or when you like . "
131925	131932	131933	131933	Ida	101	" Who 'd like an apple ? "
132137	132141	132133	132133	they	253	" the lady . "
132432	132435	132429	132429	they	2742	" the lady "
132877	132890	132891	132891	Ida	101	" I know you 'll feel uncomfortable for a little , dear , "
132902	132920	132891	132891	Ida	101	" but the strangeness will wear off ; and you 'll see how much nicer it is . "
133032	133041	133042	133042	Ida	101	" How I wish Mr. Waymark was here ! "
133057	133078	133042	133042	Ida	101	" He would enjoy it . We must give him a full account to - morrow , must n't we ? "
133079	133083	133085	133086	the other	449	" I forgot , "
133088	133109	133085	133086	the other	449	" I had a note from him this morning , saying he thought he should n't be able to come . "
133230	133234	133235	133235	Ida	101	" Poor children ! "
133240	133250	133235	133235	Ida	101	" If they had but homes to go to ! "
133258	133267	133235	133235	Ida	101	" We shall see , we shall see ! "
133358	133370	133371	133371	she	101	" Hands up , all those who have n't enjoyed themselves ! "
133397	133410	133371	133371	she	101	" Hands up , all those who would like to come again ! "
133424	133447	133411	133411	All	2775	" Well , you 've all been good , and I 'm very pleased with you , and you shall come again ! "
133820	133838	133839	133839	She	103	" Oh , I have waited so long ! I wanted to see you to - night . "
133884	133888	133889	133889	she	103	" Last night , "
133892	134059	133889	133889	she	103	" I had a telegram from father . He told me to come back at once ; he had had to leave , and mother was alone . I was to call for a letter at a place in the city . I was in time to catch the night boat , and when I got his letter it told me dreadful things . Something has happened which compelled him to leave England at once . He could do nothing , make no arrangements . Mother , he said , had a little money ; we must sell everything and manage to live somewhere for a little ; he would try to send us what he could . Then I went home . There was a police - officer in the house , and mother had gone away , I ca n't tell where . Father has done something , and Oh , what shall I do ? You can help me , ca n't you ? "
134140	134149	134150	134150	he	130	" Shall I go back home with you ? "
134174	134203	134150	134150	he	130	" Yes ; perhaps mother will have returned . But what shall we do ? What will happen to father ? Do you know anything of all this ? "
134204	134225	134226	134226	She	103	" Nothing whatever . Walk with me to the top of the street , and we will take a cab . "
134385	134391	134392	134392	he	130	" So , you see , "
134395	134493	134392	134392	he	130	" with the end of July has come the decision of my fate , as we agreed it should . If I had seen you to - morrow , as I proposed , I know not what folly I might have been guilty of . Tell Ida everything at once ; I shall never see her again . But do you , if you can , be my friend still . I need your help in this horrible situation . Meet me will you ? at the office to - morrow night , say at eight o'clock . "
135279	135286	135287	135287	he	2824	" Looks like small - pox , "
135295	135310	135287	135287	he	2824	" I would n't stand so near , sir , if I was you . "
135311	135322	135324	135324	Abraham	115	" Is n't there any one to look to her ? "
135334	135340	135341	135341	he	233	" Where 's your father ? "
135344	135347	135349	135351	the little fellow	2827	" Dono , "
135356	135361	135381	135381	her	3216	" Are you alone ? "
135362	135365	135381	135381	her	3216	" Dono . "
135384	135394	135396	135397	Mr. Woodstock	233	" What 's the matter with her up there ? "
135399	135451	135381	135381	her	3216	" She 's very bad , sir . Her Susan 's gone to get a order for the parish doctor , I b'lieve . I was just a - goin' to look after the children when you came up . I 've only just come ' ome myself , you see . "
135452	135461	135381	135381	her	3216	" What 's that horrible stench down below ? "
135462	135471	135473	135474	the woman	448	" I did n't notice nothink , sir , "
135488	135496	135381	135381	her	3216	" Any one living in the kitchen ? "
135497	135520	135381	135381	her	3216	" There was some one , I b'lieve , sir , but I do n't exac'ly know if they 's there yet . "
135618	135623	135625	135626	Mr. Woodstock	233	" What is it ? "
135633	135642	135644	135645	the other	449	" Rotten fish , it seems to me , "
135690	135701	135703	135704	the builder	2835	" We 'd better get out of this , sir , "
135706	135720	135703	135704	the builder	2835	" We shall be poisoned . Wonder they have n't the plague here . "
135721	135728	135730	135731	Mr. Woodstock	233	" Seems to me they have , "
136108	136114	136116	136116	Ida	101	" The doctor tells me , "
136118	136143	136116	136116	Ida	101	" there is a case in Litany Lane . It is very cruel . Grandfather went to make arrangements for having the houses repaired . "
136144	136151	136152	136152	Waymark	130	" There I recognise your hand , "
136161	136169	136170	136170	Ida	101	" Why have you so deserted us ? "
136173	136182	136170	136170	Ida	101	" Why do we see you so seldom ? "
136183	136206	136156	136156	she	101	" It is so late every evening before I leave the library , and I am busy with all sorts of things . "
136553	136560	136561	136561	he	130	" The slums have avenged themselves , "
136567	136571	136561	136561	he	130	" though late . "
136726	136758	136715	136715	he	118	" I told you so . She is just behind there . She has come round by the back streets , just to see if I 'd told her the truth . "
136767	136773	136774	136774	he	130	" Pooh ! Never mind , "
136777	136784	136774	136774	he	130	" You 're used to it . "
136785	136792	136793	136793	Julian	118	" Used to it ! Yes , "
136810	136818	136796	136796	his	118	" and it is driving me mad . "
136826	136838	136793	136793	Julian	118	" She found my poem last night , and burnt it . "
136839	136843	136793	136793	Julian	118	" Burnt it ? "
136844	136871	136793	136793	Julian	118	" Yes ; simply because she could not understand it . She said she thought it was waste paper , but I saw , I saw . "
137236	137338	137339	137339	He	142	" Waymark , you 're a brick ! Mr. Casti , I 'm rejoiced to receive you in my establishment ! You 're neither a minute too soon nor a minute too late . Mrs. O'Gree only this moment called out from the kitchen that the kettle was boiling and the crumpets at the point of perfection ! I knew your punctuality of old , Waymark . Mr. Casti , how does it strike you ? Roaring trade , Waymark ! Done two shillings and threepence three farthings this Sunday morning . Look here , me boy , ho , ho ! "
137518	137528	137530	137533	the ex - teacher	2887	" We pass , you observe , Mr. Casti , "
137535	137584	137530	137533	the ex - teacher	2887	" from the region of commerce to that of domestic intimacy . Here Mrs. O'Gree reigns supreme , as indeed she does in the other department , as far as presiding genius goes . She 's in all places at once , like a birrud ! Mr. Casti , "
137589	137616	137530	137533	the ex - teacher	2887	" I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to one of the most remarkable women it was ever your lot to meet ; a phenomenon of "
137732	137746	137748	137749	Mr. O'Gree	142	" An improvement this on the masters ' room , eh , Waymark ? "
137758	137770	137748	137749	Mr. O'Gree	142	" And that reminds me ! We 've got a lodger . "
137771	137774	137748	137749	Mr. O'Gree	142	" Already ? "
137775	137814	137748	137749	Mr. O'Gree	142	" And who d'ye think ? Who d'ye think ? You would n't guess if you went on till Christmas . Ho , ho , ho ! I 'm hanged if I tell you . Wait and see ! "
137815	137822	137824	137824	Sally	105	" Shall I call him down ? "
137966	137972	137973	137973	Waymark	130	" How do things go ? "
137977	137983	137973	137973	Waymark	130	" Found a better school ? "
137984	137992	137994	137994	Egger	149	" No , no , my friend , "
138002	138059	137994	137994	Egger	149	" At the school I made my possible ; I did till I could no more . I have made like Mr. O'Gree ; it is to say , quite a change in my life . I am waiter at a restaurant . And see me ; am I not the better quite ? No fear ! "
138068	138089	137994	137994	Egger	149	" I have enough to eat and to drink , and money in my pocket . The school may go to "
138173	138176	138177	138177	she	105	" There ! "
138180	138189	138177	138177	she	105	" I 've doubted the miller 's eye . "
138201	138209	138210	138210	he	130	" That 's a piece of Weymouth , "
138213	138225	138226	138226	he	142	" Mrs. O'Gree comes from the south - west of England , "
138233	138254	138226	138226	he	142	" She 's constantly teaching me new and interesting things . Now , if I was to spill the salt here "
138281	138298	138273	138273	Sally	105	" None of your nonsense , sir ! Give Mr. Casti some more meat , instead . "
138353	138356	138358	138359	her husband	584	" Pickles ? "
138366	138374	138382	138382	his	142	" Now , look here , Waymark , "
138385	138437	138382	138382	his	142	" Look here , Mr. Casti . The one drop of bitterness in our cup is pickles ; the one thing that threatens to poison our happiness is pickles . We 're always being asked for pickles ; just as if the people knew about it , and came on purpose ! "
138438	138443	138445	138445	Waymark	130	" Knew About what ? "
138450	138531	138382	138382	his	142	" Why , that we may n't sell 'em ! A few doors off there 's a scoundrel of a grocer . Now , his landlord 's the same as ours , and when we took this shop there was one condition attached . Because the grocer sells pickles , and makes a good thing of them , we had to undertake that , in that branch of commerce , we would n't compete with him . Pickles are forbidden . "
138661	138667	138668	138668	he	130	" Sally 's great ambition , "
138671	138730	138668	138668	he	130	" is to be taken cabinet - size , and in a snow - storm . You 've seen the kind of thing in the shop - windows ? We 'll manage that before long , but this will do for the present . You do n't see a face like that every day ; eh , Waymark ? "
138845	138852	138853	138853	she	105	" Have you seen her lately ? "
138856	138862	138868	138868	his	449	" Not for some weeks , "
138871	138889	138890	138890	she	105	" Well , it 's the queerest thing I ever knew , s'nough ! But , there , "
138904	138904	138890	138890	she	105	"
138915	138920	138921	138921	he	130	" All a mistake , "
138924	138949	138912	138912	his	130	" Yes , that 's just what it is , you may depend upon it . I more'n half believe you 're telling fibs . "
139061	139064	139065	139065	he	130	" Bedad , "
139068	139115	139065	139065	he	130	" I sent old Pendy a business prospectus , with my compliments written on the bottom of it . I thought he might perhaps be disposed to give me a contract for victualling the Academy . I wish he had , for the boys ' sake . "
139170	139192	139149	139149	he	149	" Die Schwalb'n flieg'n fort , doch sie zieh'n wieder her ; Der Mensch wenn er fortgeht , er kommt nimmermehr ! "
139393	139400	139401	139401	he	130	" We must have a cab , "
139404	139416	139401	139401	he	130	" It is impossible for you to walk in this state . "
139457	139467	139468	139468	he	130	" There 's no misunderstanding this , old fellow , "
139488	139495	139496	139496	Julian	118	" You 'll laugh at me , "
139500	139607	139496	139496	Julian	118	" but is n't there a certain resemblance between my case and that of Keats ? He too was a drug - pounder ; he liked it as little as I do ; and he died young of consumption . I suppose a dying man may speak the truth about himself . I too might have been a poet , if life had dealt more kindly with me . I think you would have liked the thing I was writing ; I 'd finished some three hundred lines ; but now you 'll never see it . Well , I do n't know that it matters . "
139631	139636	139637	139637	Casti	118	" Do you remember , "
139640	139758	139637	139637	Casti	118	" when all my talk used to be about Rome , and how I planned to see it one day see it again . I should say ? Strange to think that I really was born in Rome . I used to call myself a Roman , you know , and grow hot with pride when I thought of it . Those were dreams . Oh , I was to do wonderful things ! Poetry was to make me rich , and then I would go and live in Italy , and fill my lungs with the breath of the Forum , and write my great Epic . How good that we ca n't foresee our lives ! "
139759	139765	139766	139766	Waymark	130	" I wish to heaven , "
139774	139811	139766	139766	Waymark	130	" that you would be a man and shake this monstrous yoke from off your neck ! It is that that is killing you . Give yourself a chance . Defy everything and make yourself free . "
139818	139835	139836	139836	He	118	" Too late ! I have n't the courage . My mind weakens with my body . "
140557	140568	140569	140569	others	256	" unsavoury productions of the so - called naturalist school ; "
141376	141647	141347	141347	She	101	" Why did I break free from the fetters of a shameful life ? Because I loved , and loved you . What gave me the strength to pass from idle luxury , poisoning the energies of the soul , to that life of lonely toil and misery ? My love , and my love for you . I kept apart from you then ; I would not even let you know what I was enduring ; only because you had spoken a hasty , thoughtless word to me , which showed me with terrible distinctness the meaning of all I had escaped , and filled me with a determination to prove to myself that I had not lost all my better nature , that there was still enough of purity in my being to save me finally . What was it that afflicted me with agony beyond all words when I was made the victim of a cruel and base accusation ? Not the fear of its consequences ; only the dread lest you should believe me guilty , and no longer deem me worthy of a thought . It is no arrogance to say that I am become a pure woman ; not my own merits , but love of you has made me so . I love you as a woman loves only once ; if you asked me to give up my life to prove it , I am capable of doing no less a thing than that . Flesh and spirit I lay before you all yours ; do you still think the offering unworthy ? "
141890	141893	141876	141876	she	101	" landlord . "
141964	141969	141959	141959	she	101	" the right sort . "
142649	142657	142638	142638	she	101	" I thought you would never come again "
142658	142667	142668	142668	he	130	" I have not kept away through thoughtlessness , "
142671	142701	142638	142638	she	101	" Believe that ; it is the truth . And to - night I have only come to say good - bye . I am going to leave London . "
142702	142724	142638	142638	she	101	" You used to say nothing would induce you to leave London , and that you could n't live anywhere else . "
142725	142761	142638	142638	she	101	" Yes ; that was one of my old fancies . I am going right away into the country , at all events for a year or two . I suppose I shall write novels . "
142779	142787	142788	142788	Ida	101	" Has your book been a success ? "
142791	142798	142638	142638	she	101	" No ; it fell dead . "
142799	142809	142638	142638	she	101	" Why did n't you give me a copy ? "
142810	142830	142638	142638	she	101	" I thought too little of it . It 's poor stuff . Better you should n't read it . "
142831	142838	142638	142638	she	101	" But I have read it . "
142839	142849	142638	142638	she	101	" Got it from the library , did you ? "
142850	142857	142638	142638	she	101	" No ; I bought it . "
142858	142868	142638	142638	she	101	" What a pity to waste so much money ! "
142869	142887	142638	142638	she	101	" Why do you speak like that ? You know how anything of yours would interest me . "
142888	142900	142638	142638	she	101	" Oh yes , in a certain way , of course . "
142901	142942	142638	142638	she	101	" For its own sake , too . I ca n't criticise , but I know it held me as nothing else ever did . It was horrible in many parts , but I was the better for reading it . "
143021	143031	143032	143032	she	101	" Who should read it , if not I ? "
143040	143053	143032	143032	she	101	" Who can possibly understand it half so well as I do ? "
143054	143057	143058	143058	he	2969	" Yes , "
143065	143089	143058	143058	he	2969	" you have seen the places and the people . And I hear you are going on with the work your grandfather began ? "
143090	143134	143032	143032	she	101	" I am trying to do something . If you had been able to give me a little time now and then , I should have asked you to advise and help me . It is hard to work there single - handed . "
143135	143159	143058	143058	he	2969	" You are too good for that ; I should have liked to think of you as far apart from those vile scenes . "
143160	143166	143167	143167	Her	101	" Too good for it ? "
143171	143245	143167	143167	Her	101	" How can any one be too good to help the miserable ? If you had said that I was not worthy of such a privilege Can you , knowing me as no one else does or ever will , think that I could live here in peace , whilst those poor creatures stint and starve themselves every week to provide me with comforts ? Do I seem to you such a woman ? "
143258	143363	143167	143167	Her	101	" I had hoped you understood me better than that . Is that why you have left me to myself ? Do you doubt my sincerity ? Why do you speak so cruelly , saying I am too good , when your real thoughts must be so different ? You mean that I am incapable of really doing anything ; you have no faith in me . I seem to you too weak to pursue any high end . You would not even speak to me of your book , because you felt I should not appreciate it . And yet you do know me "
143364	143372	143373	143373	Waymark	130	" Yes ; I know you well , "
143382	143442	143376	143376	Ida	101	" If you are speaking to me for the last time , wo n't you be sincere , and tell me of my faults ? Do you think I could not bear it ? You can say nothing to me nothing from your heart that I wo n't accept in all humility . Are we no longer even friends ? "
143443	143449	143167	143167	Her	101	" You mistake me altogether . "
143450	143458	143459	143459	she	101	" And you are still my friend ? "
143463	143475	143459	143459	she	101	" But why do you think me unfit for good work ? "
143476	143541	143167	143167	Her	101	" I had no such thought . You know how my ideals oppose each other . I spoke on the impulse of the moment ; I often find it so hard to reconcile myself to anything in life that is not , still and calm and beautiful . I am just now bent on forgetting all the things about which you are so earnest . "
143542	143564	143459	143459	she	101	" Earnest ? Yes . But I can not give my whole self to the work . I am so lonely . "
143565	143574	143575	143575	he	2972	" You will not be so for long , "
143581	143647	143575	143575	he	2972	" You have every opportunity of making for yourself a good social position . You will soon have friends , if only you seek them . Your goodness will make you respected . Indeed I wonder at your remaining so isolated . It need not be ; I am sure it need not . Your wealth I have no thought of speaking cynically your wealth must "
143648	143695	143707	143707	his	2974	" My wealth ! What is it to me ? What do I care for all the friends it might bring ? They are nothing to me in my misery . But you ... I would give all I possess for one kind word from you . "
143740	143755	143756	143756	she	2973	" I have tried hard to make myself ever so little worthy of you , "
143768	143778	143756	143756	she	2973	" Am I still still too far beneath you ? "
143793	143801	143779	143779	He	2974	" Ida , I am not free . "
143815	143876	143806	143806	Ida	101	" This was your secret ? Tell me , then . Look I am strong ! Tell me about it . I might have thought of this . I thought only of myself . I might have known there was good reason for the distance you put between us . Forgive me oh , forgive the pain I have caused you !
143877	143889	143806	143806	Ida	101	" You asking for forgiveness ? How you must despise me . "
143890	143938	143806	143806	Ida	101	" Why should I despise you ? You have never said a word to me that any friend , any near friend , might not have said , never since I myself , in my folly , forbade you to . You were not bound to tell me "
143939	143946	143947	143947	Waymark	130	" I had told your grandfather , "
143954	143981	143947	143947	Waymark	130	" In a letter I wrote the very day he was taken ill , I begged him to let you know that I had bound myself . "
144013	144050	143983	143983	he	130	" But it was my own fault that it was left so long . I would not let him tell you when he wished to ; I put off the day as long as I could . "
144051	144058	144059	144059	she	2977	" Since you first knew me ? "
144067	144082	144088	144088	his	130	" No ! Since you came to live here . I was free before . "
144141	144148	144149	144149	she	2977	" I thought you loved me , "
144156	144205	144153	144153	her	2977	" I did and I do . I ca n't understand myself , and it would be worse than vain to try to show you how it came about . I have brought a curse upon my life , and worse than my own despair is your misery . "
144206	144218	144219	144219	Ida	101	" Is she a good woman you are going to marry ? "
144225	144232	144153	144153	her	2977	" Only less noble than yourself . "
144233	144258	144153	144153	her	2977	" And she loves you no , she can not love as I do but she loves you worthily and with all her soul ? "
144259	144271	144153	144153	her	2977	" Worthily and with all her soul the greater my despair . "
144272	144327	144153	144153	her	2977	" Then I dare not think of her one unkind thought . We must remember her , and be strong for her sake . You will leave London and forget me soon , yes , yes , you will try to forget me . You owe it to her ; it is your duty . "
144328	144331	144332	144332	he	2979	" Duty ! "
144337	144418	144332	144332	he	2979	" What have I to do with duty ? Was it not my duty to be true to you ? Was it not my duty to confess my hateful weakness , when I had taken the fatal step ? Duty has no meaning for me . I have set it aside at every turn . Even now there would be no obligation on me to keep my word , but that I am too great a coward to revoke it . "
144425	144498	144153	144153	her	2977	" Dear , I will call you so , it is for the last time , you think these things in the worst moment of our suffering ; afterwards you will thank me for having been strong enough , or cold enough , to be your conscience . There is such a thing as duty ; it speaks in your heart and in mine , and tells us that we must part . "
144499	144513	144591	144591	She	2980	" You speak so lightly of parting . If you felt all that I "
144514	144524	144525	144525	she	2980	" My love is no shadow less than yours , "
144536	144549	144525	144525	she	2980	" I have never wavered from you since I knew you first . "
144550	144553	144591	144591	She	2980	" Ida ! "
144554	144590	144525	144525	she	2980	" I meant no reproach , but it will perhaps help you to think of that . You did love her , if it was only for a day , and that love will return . "
144601	144606	144607	144607	he	2981	" You shame me , "
144614	144624	144611	144611	his	2981	" I am not worthy to touch your hand . "
144625	144628	144629	144629	she	2980	" Yes , "
144637	144741	144629	144629	she	2980	" very worthy of all the love I have given you , and of the love with which she will make you happy . I shall suffer , but the thought of your happiness will help me to bear up and try to live a life you would not call ignoble . You will do great things , and I shall hear of them , and be glad . Yes ; I know that is before you . You are one of those who can not rest till they have won a high place . I , too , have my work , and "
144746	144757	144611	144611	his	2981	" Shall we never see each other again , Ida ? "
144758	144782	144611	144611	his	2981	" Perhaps . In a few years we might meet , and be friends . But I dare not think of that now . "
145531	145541	145542	145542	Theresa	206	" We shall not see each other after tonight , "
145556	145571	145549	145549	her	206	" Is there anything more you would like to say to me , Maud ? "
145572	145589	145549	145549	her	206	" Only that I shall always think of you , and grieve that we are parted . "
145590	145598	145600	145602	the other sadly	3015	" You are going into the world , "
145604	145623	145600	145602	the other sadly	3015	" my thoughts can not follow you there . But your purer spirit will often be with me . "
145624	145720	145549	145549	her	206	" And your spirit with me . If I had been permitted to share your life , that would have been my greatest joy . I am consciously choosing what my soul would set aside . For a time I thought I had reconciled myself to the world ; I found delight in it , and came to look on the promptings of the spirit as morbid fancies . That has passed . I know the highest , but between me and it there is a gulf which it may be I shall never pass . "
145721	145728	145730	145730	Theresa	206	" It is only to few , "
145742	145752	145730	145730	Theresa	206	" that it is given to persevere and attain . "
146067	146070	146071	146071	she	103	" Father , "
146261	146269	146270	146270	she	103	" You will stay with me now ? "
146280	146400	146270	146270	she	103	" You wo n't leave me again , Paul ? We will hide you here . No , no ; I am for getting . You will go away with us , away from London to a safe place . Maud is going to be married to - morrow , and we will live with her in her new home . You have suffered dreadfully ; you look so changed , so ill . You shall rest , and I will nurse you . Oh , I will be a good wife to you , Paul . Speak to me , do speak to me : speak kindly , dear ! How long is it since I lost you ? "
146401	146409	146410	146410	he	3036	" I dare n't stay , Emily , "
146420	146486	146410	146410	he	3036	" I should be discovered . I must get away from England , that is my only chance . I have scarcely left the house where I was hiding all this time . It would n't have been safe to try and escape , even if I had had any money . I have hungered for days , and I am weaker than a child . "
146497	146505	146506	146506	she	3037	" It was all for my sake ! "
146514	146592	146506	146506	she	3037	" I am your curse . I have brought you to ruin a second time . I am a bad , wretched woman ; if you drove me from you with blows it would be less than I deserve ! You can never forgive me ; but let me be your slave , let me suffer something dreadful for your sake ! Why did I ever recover from my madness , only to bring that upon you ! "
146610	146621	146622	146622	he	3038	" No , it is not your fault , Emily , "
146625	146650	146622	146622	he	3038	" Only my own weakness and folly . Your love repays me for all I have undergone ; that was all I ever wanted . "
146682	146699	146700	146700	he	3038	" If I can only get money enough to leave the country , I am saved , "
146703	146727	146700	146700	he	3038	" If I stay here , I shall be found , and they will imprison me for years . I had rather kill myself !
146728	146737	146660	146660	she	3039	" Mr. Waymark will give us the money , "
146742	146750	146660	146660	she	3039	" and we will go away together . "
146751	146779	146700	146700	he	3038	" That would betray me ; it would be folly to face such a risk . If I can escape , then you shall come to me . "
146780	146788	146789	146789	she	3041	" Oh , you will leave me ! "
146792	146849	146789	146789	she	3041	" I shall lose you , as I did before , but this time for ever ! You do n't love me , Paul ! And how can I expect you should ? But let me go as your servant . Let me dress like a man , and follow you . Who will notice then ? "
146855	147009	146700	146700	he	3038	" I love you , Emily , and shall love you as long as I breathe . To hear you speak to me like this has almost the power to make me happy . If I had known it , I should n't have stayed so long away from you ; I had n't the courage to come , and I thought the sight of me would only be misery to you . I have lived a terrible life , among the poorest people , getting my bread as they did ; oftener starving . Not one of my acquaintances was to be trusted . I have not seen one face I knew since I first heard of my danger and escaped . But I had rather live on like that than fall into the hands of the police ; I should never know freedom again . The thought maddens me with fear . "
147010	147021	147022	147022	she	3043	" You are safe here , love , quite safe ! "
147026	147046	147022	147022	she	3043	" Who could know that you are here ? Who could know that Maud and I were living here ? "
147072	147075	147077	147078	Miss Bygrave	121	" Emily , "
147082	147098	147077	147078	Miss Bygrave	121	" let me come in or let Paul come out here and speak to me . "
147134	147139	147140	147140	he	203	" What is it ? "
147154	147185	147143	147143	She	3043	" Some one I do n't know is at the front door . I opened it with the chain on , and a man said he must see Mr. Enderby . "
147186	147196	147197	147197	Paul	203	" Ca n't I go out by the back ? "
147206	147237	147197	147197	Paul	203	" I dare n't hide in the rooms ; they will search them all . How did they know that I was here ? O God , I am lost ! "
147300	147304	147254	147255	his wife	505	" Hold on ! "
147309	147320	147254	147255	his wife	505	" You must come back with me into the house . "
147361	147370	147372	147374	the police officer	3052	" Better open the front door , ma'am , "
147376	147393	147372	147374	the police officer	3052	" and ask my friend there to come through . We 've got all we want . "
147442	147453	147454	147454	he	3056	" You 'll go quietly with us , I suppose ? "
147519	147522	147523	147523	Maud	103	" Mother , "
147530	147540	147523	147523	Maud	103	" are you better ? Do you know me ? "
148034	148041	148016	148016	she	103	" Aunt , is madness hereditary ? "
148075	148081	148082	148082	she	103	" I am quite myself , "
148085	148102	148082	148082	she	103	" and I feel better . Yes , I remember reading somewhere that it was hereditary . "
148110	148113	148114	148114	she	103	" Aunt , "
148118	148138	148114	148114	she	103	" I shall never be married . It would be wrong to him . I am afraid of myself . "
148225	148287	148214	148214	she	103	" If I had seen you when you called yesterday , I should have had to face a task beyond my strength . Yet it would be wrong to keep from you any longer what I have to say . I must write it , and hope your knowledge of me will help you to understand what I can only imperfectly express .
148288	148477	148214	148214	she	103	" I ask you to let me break my promise to you . I have not ceased to love you ; to me you are still all that is best and dearest in the world . You would have made my life very happy . But happiness is now what I dare not wish for . I am too weak to make that use of it which , I do not doubt , is permitted us ; it would enslave my soul . With a nature such as mine , there is only one path of safety : I must renounce all . You know me to be no hypocrite , and to you , in this moment , I need not fear to speak my whole thought , The sacrifice has cost me much To break my faith to you , and to put aside for ever all the world 's joys the strength for this has only come after hours of bitterest striving . Try to be glad that I have won ; it is all behind me , and I stand upon the threshold of peace .
148478	148691	148214	148214	she	103	" You know how from a child I have suffered . What to others was pure and lawful joy became to me a temptation . But God was not unjust ; if He so framed me , He gave me at the same time the power to understand and to choose . All those warnings which I have , in my blindness , spoken of so lightly to you , I now recall with humbler and truer mind . If the shadow of sin darkened my path , it was that I might look well to my steps , and , alas , I have failed so , have gone so grievously astray ! God , in His righteous anger , has terribly visited me . The most fearful form of death has risen before me ; I have been cast into abysses of horror , and only saved from frenzy by the mercy which brought all this upon me for my good . A few months ago I had also a warning . I did not disregard it , but I could not overcome the love which bound me to you . But for that love , how much easier it would have been to me to overcome the world and myself .
148692	148764	148771	148771	Waymark	130	" You will forgive me , for you will understand me . Do not write in reply ; spare me , I entreat you , a renewal of that dark hour I have passed through . With my aunt I am going to leave London . We shall remain together , and she will strengthen me in the new life . May God bless you here and hereafter . MAUD ENDERBY . "
148779	148908	148776	148777	Miss Bygrave	121	" Doubtless you know that Maud has written desiring me to release her . I can not but remember that she is scarcely yet recovered from a severe illness , and her letter must not be final . She entreats me not to write to her or see her . Accordingly I address myself to you , and beg that you will not allow Maud to take any irrevocable step till she is perfectly well , and has had time to reflect . I shall still deem her promise to me binding . If after the lapse of six months from now she still desires to be released , I must know it , either from herself or from you . Write to me at the old address . "
149021	149024	149025	149025	Waymark	130	" Casti , "
149044	149050	149025	149025	Waymark	130	" come away with me . "
149057	149061	149051	149051	Julian	118	" Where to ? "
149062	149073	149025	149025	Waymark	130	" Anywhere . To some place where the sun shines . "
149074	149095	149051	149051	Julian	118	" What an impossible idea ! How am I to get my living ? And how is she to live ? "
149096	149100	149101	149101	Waymark	130	" Look here , "
149106	149189	149101	149101	Waymark	130	" my will is a little stronger than yours , and in the present case I mean to exercise it . I have said , and there 's an end of it . You say she 'll be away from home to - morrow . Good . We go together , pack up your books and things in half an hour or so , bring them here , and then off ! Sic volo , sic jubeo , sit pro ratione voluntas ! "
149803	149809	149810	149810	Waymark	130	" What shall I read ? "
149819	149830	149831	149831	Julian	118	" Read that passage in the Georgics which glorifies Italy , "
149834	149844	149831	149831	Julian	118	" It will suit my mood to - night . "
149851	149883	149845	149845	Waymark	130	" Sed neque Medorum silvae , ditissima terra , Nec pulcher Ganges atque auro turbibus Hermus Laudibus Italiae certent , non Bactra , neque Indi , Totaque turiferis Panchaia pinguis arenis . "
149906	149909	149910	149910	Julian	118	" Waymark , "
149921	149930	149918	149918	his	118	" why do we never speak of her ? "
149931	149938	149939	149939	Waymark	130	" Can we speak of her ? "
149948	149975	149939	149939	Waymark	130	" A short time ago I could not ; now I feel the need . It will give me no pain , but great happiness . ' ,
149976	149983	149984	149984	he	118	" That is all gone by , "
149992	150026	149984	149984	he	118	" To me she is no longer anything but a remembrance , an ideal I once knew . The noblest and sweetest woman I have known , or shall know , on earth . "
150068	150074	150075	150075	Julian	118	" In a little while , "
150086	150097	150075	150075	Julian	118	" you will have your second letter . And then ? "
150593	150595	150571	150571	she	3120	" twos "
150631	150903	150611	150611	she	3120	" Oh , Miss Woodstock , mem , there 's a poor young ' oman a - lyin ' at the Clock ' Ouse , as it really makes one 's ' art bleed to tell of her ! For all she 's so young , she 's a widder , an ' pr'aps it 's as well she should be , seein ' how shockin ' her ' usband treated her afore he was took where no doubt he 's bein ' done as he did by . It 's fair cruel , Miss Woodstock , mem , to see her sufferin 's . She has fits , an ' falls down everywheres ; it 's a mercy as she ' asn't been run over in the public street long ago . They 're hepiplectic fits , I 'm told , an ' laws o ' me ! the way she foams at the mouth ! No doubt as they was brought on by her ' usband 's etrocious treatment . I understand as he was a man as called hisself a gentleman . He was allus that jealous of the pore innocent thing , mem castin ' in her teeth things as I could n't bring myself not even to ' int at in your presence , Miss Woodstock , mem . Many 's the time he 's beat her black an ' blue , when she jist went out to get a bit o ' somethink for his tea at night , 'cos he would ' ave it she 'd been a - doin' what she ' adn't ought "
150904	150909	150914	150914	she	101	" Where is she ? "
150926	151026	150611	150611	she	3120	" I said at the Clock ' Ouse , mem . Mrs. Sprowl 's took her in ' mem , and is be'avin ' to her like a mother . She knew her , did Mrs. Sprowl , in the pore thing 's ' appy days , before ever she married . But of course it ai n't likely as Mrs. Sprowl can keep her as long as her pore life lasts ; not to speak of the expense ; its a terrible responsibility , owin ' to the hepiplectic ailment , mem , as of course you understand . "
151027	151036	150914	150914	she	101	" Ca n't she get into any hospital ! "
151037	151097	150611	150611	she	3120	" She only just came out , mem , not two weeks ago . They could n't do no more for the pore creature , and so she had to go . An ' she ' asn't not a friend in the world , ' ceptin ' Mrs. Sprowl , as is no less than a mother to her . "
151098	151105	150914	150914	she	101	" Do you know her name ? "
151106	151136	150611	150611	she	3120	" Mrs. Casty , mem . It 's a Irish name , I b'lieve , an ' I ca n't say as I 'm partial to the Irish , but "
