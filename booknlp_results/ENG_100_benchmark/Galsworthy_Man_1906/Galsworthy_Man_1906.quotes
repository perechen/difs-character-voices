1750	1765	1748	1748	himself	168	" Come , now , should I have paid that visit in that hat ? "
1770	1773	1767	1767	each	509	" No ! "
1786	1796	1775	1775	some	510	" It would never have come into my head ! "
1825	1829	1830	1830	he	183	" Very haughty ! "
1833	1838	1830	1830	he	183	" the wild Buccaneer . "
1875	1888	1889	1889	they	513	" We do n't think you ought to let him , dear ! "
1911	1928	1897	1897	her	166	" Oh ! what does it matter ? Phil never knows what he 's got on ! "
2473	2489	2461	2461	George	183	" Looks as if he might make a bolt of it - the dashing Buccaneer ! "
2602	2627	2582	2585	Old Jolyon 's coachman	540	" I dunno what to make of ' i m. Looks to me for all the world like an ' alf - tame leopard . "
2904	2911	2912	2912	she	166	" Irene is my greatest chum , "
2915	2924	2912	2912	she	166	" Please be good friends , you two ! "
2963	2970	2942	2943	Soames Forsyte	171	" Ah ! introduce me too ! "
3036	3046	3047	3047	he	559	" I wonder at Jolyon 's allowing this engagement , "
3053	3071	3072	3072	he	559	" They tell me there 's no chance of their getting married for years . This young Bosinney "
3087	3121	3072	3072	he	559	" has got nothing . When Winifred married Dartie , I made him bring every penny into settlement - lucky thing , too - they 'd ha ' had nothing by this time ! "
3186	3189	3190	3190	he	559	" Well , "
3193	3220	3190	3190	he	559	" I could n't help Irene 's having no money . Soames was in such a hurry ; he got quite thin dancing attendance on her . "
3242	3248	3249	3249	he	559	" It 's my opinion , "
3253	3264	3249	3249	he	559	" that it 's just as well as it is . "
3331	3335	3336	3336	he	559	" But where , "
3339	3350	3336	3336	he	559	" was Timothy ? Had n't he come with them ? "
3364	3390	3352	3353	Aunt Ann	169	" No , he did n't think it wise , with so much of this diphtheria about ; and he so liable to take things . "
3394	3418	3391	3391	James	173	" Well , HE takes good care of himself . I ca n't afford to take the care of myself that he does . "
3624	3678	3615	3615	James	173	" This is n't real old Worcester . I s'pose Jolyon 's told you something about the young man . From all I can learn , he 's got no business , no income , and no connection worth speaking of ; but then , I know nothing - nobody tells me anything . "
3790	3805	3786	3786	James	173	" Jolyon , he will have his own way . He 's got no children "
3854	3857	3858	3858	he	574	" Well , "
3862	3910	3858	3858	he	574	" if he likes to do these things , I s'pose he can afford to . Now , what 's he going to give her ? I s'pose he 'll give her a thousand a year ; he 's got nobody else to leave his money to . "
3953	3958	3959	3959	he	574	" Well , Nick , "
3962	3967	3959	3959	he	574	" how are you ? "
4023	4028	4029	4029	he	581	" I 'm bad , "
4034	4077	4029	4029	he	581	" been bad all the week ; do n't sleep at night . The doctor ca n't tell why . He 's a clever fellow , or I should n't have him , but I get nothing out of him but bills . "
4078	4081	4083	4083	James	173	" Doctors ! "
4092	4164	4083	4083	James	173	" I 've had all the doctors in London for one or another of us . There 's no satisfaction to be got out of them ; they 'll tell you anything . There 's Swithin , now . What good have they done him ? There he is ; he 's bigger than ever ; he 's enormous ; they ca n't get his weight down . Look at him ! "
4195	4202	4203	4203	he	172	" Er - how are you ? "
4227	4232	4203	4203	he	172	" how are you ? "
4260	4266	4268	4268	James	173	" We were just saying , "
4270	4279	4268	4268	James	173	" that you do n't get any thinner . "
4292	4301	4302	4302	he	172	" Thinner ? I 'm in good case , "
4310	4321	4302	4302	he	172	" not one of your thread - papers like you ! "
4454	4462	4464	4464	James	173	" I 'm very well in myself , "
4466	4491	4464	4464	James	173	" but my nerves are out of order . The least thing worries me to death . I shall have to go to Bath . "
4492	4495	4497	4497	Nicholas	189	" Bath ! "
4499	4532	4464	4464	James	173	" I 've tried Harrogate . That 's no good . What I want is sea air . There 's nothing like Yarmouth . Now , when I go there I sleep .... "
4533	4540	4542	4542	Swithin	172	" My liver 's very bad , "
4545	4550	4552	4552	he	172	" Dreadful pain here ; "
4561	4566	4568	4568	James	173	" Want of exercise , "
4580	4589	4576	4576	He	172	" I get a pain there , too . "
4606	4609	4610	4610	he	172	" Exercise ! "
4613	4627	4610	4610	he	172	" I take plenty : I never use the lift at the Club . "
4628	4634	4635	4635	James	173	" I did n't know , "
4639	4651	4635	4635	James	173	" I know nothing about anybody ; nobody tells me anything .... "
4659	4669	4652	4652	Swithin	172	" What do you do for a pain there ? "
4673	4679	4670	4670	James	173	" I take a compound .... "
4680	4687	4688	4688	June	166	" How are you , uncle ? "
4720	4725	4726	4726	he	172	" How are you ? "
4733	4767	4768	4768	He	172	" So you 're going to Wales to - morrow to visit your young man 's aunts ? You 'll have a lot of rain there . This is n't real old Worcester . "
4773	4790	4768	4768	He	172	" Now , that set I gave your mother when she married was the genuine thing . "
4833	4839	4840	4840	she	169	" Well , my dear , "
4843	4854	4840	4840	she	169	" and so you 're going for a whole month ! "
5379	5385	5391	5392	Soames Forsyte	171	" Well , Aunt Ann ? "
5442	5452	5453	5453	he	171	" And what do you think of the engagement ? "
5506	5514	5515	5515	she	169	" Very nice for the young man , "
5518	5543	5515	5515	she	169	" and he 's a good - looking young fellow ; but I doubt if he 's quite the right lover for dear June . "
5555	5561	5562	5562	he	171	" She 'll tame him , "
5577	5602	5562	5562	he	171	" That 's genuine old lacquer ; you ca n't get it nowadays . It 'd do well in a sale at Jobson 's . "
5629	5638	5639	5639	he	171	" I would n't mind having it myself , "
5642	5653	5639	5639	he	171	" you can always get your price for old lacquer . "
5654	5664	5666	5667	Aunt Ann	169	" You 're so clever with all those things , "
5669	5676	5666	5667	Aunt Ann	169	" And how is dear Irene ? "
5682	5686	5687	5687	he	171	" Pretty well , "
5690	5707	5709	5709	he	171	" Complains she ca n't sleep ; she sleeps a great deal better than I do , "
5728	5731	5732	5732	she	169	" Perhaps , "
5735	5762	5732	5732	she	169	" it will be just as well for her not to see so much of June . She 's such a decided character , dear June ! "
5790	5803	5804	5804	he	171	" I do n't know what she sees in that little flibbertigibbet , "
5826	5836	5838	5839	his father	559	" They tell me Jolyon 's bought another house , "
5845	5888	5838	5839	his father	559	" he must have a lot of money - he must have more money than he knows what to do with ! Montpellier Square , they say ; close to Soames ! They never told me , Irene never tells me anything ! "
5889	5899	5904	5904	Swithin	172	" Capital position , not two minutes from me , "
5906	5920	5904	5904	Swithin	172	" and from my rooms I can drive to the Club in eight . "
6108	6160	6095	6096	Aunt Hester	181	" I do n't recollect that he ever did anything ; at least , not in my time . He was er - an owner of houses , my dear . His hair about your Uncle Swithin 's colour ; rather a square build . Tall ? No - not very tall "
6173	6217	6161	6161	he	192	" a fresh - coloured man . I remember he used to drink Madeira ; but ask your Aunt Ann . What was his father ? He - er - had to do with the land down in Dorsetshire , by the sea . "
6394	6406	6407	6407	he	192	" There 's very little to be had out of that , "
6410	6421	6407	6407	he	192	" regular country little place , old as the hills .... "
6451	6460	6462	6462	he	163	" Yeomen - I suppose very small beer . "
6781	6790	6791	6791	he	163	" Collect house property , nothing like it , "
6795	6801	6791	6791	he	163	" I never did anything else "
6946	6954	6956	6956	James	173	" Twenty - two years to run ? "
6958	6974	6956	6956	James	173	" The very house I was after - you 've given too much for it ! "
6979	6988	6990	6990	James	173	" It 's not that I want it , "
6993	7026	6990	6990	James	173	" it would n't suit my purpose at that price . Soames knows the house , well - he 'll tell you it 's too dear - his opinion 's worth having . "
7027	7032	7034	7035	old Jolyon	163	" I do n't , "
7037	7045	7034	7035	old Jolyon	163	" care a fig for his opinion . "
7046	7049	7051	7051	James	173	" Well , "
7053	7111	7051	7051	James	173	" you will have your own way - it 's a good opinion . Good - bye ! We 're going to drive down to Hurlingham . They tell me June 's going to Wales . You 'll be lonely tomorrow . What 'll you do with yourself ? You 'd better come and dine with us ! "
7220	7234	7217	7218	Mrs. James	173	" Did you ever see such a collection of rumty - too people ? "
7392	7395	7397	7397	Roger	317	" Yes , "
7424	7484	7485	7485	She	709	" This brother had a high forehead , and the freshest colour of any of the Forsytes ; his light grey eyes measured the street frontage of the houses by the way , and now and then he would level his , umbrella and take a ' lunar , ' as he expressed it , of the varying heights . "
7490	7532	7485	7485	She	709	" replied Nicholas . He himself had married a good deal of money , of which , it being then the golden age before the Married Women 's Property Act , he had mercifully been enabled to make a successful use . "
7538	7539	7540	7540	Heron	201	" "
7553	7559	7549	7549	they	704	" Roger shook his head . "
7567	7571	7572	7572	They	704	" he said . "
7581	7587	7579	7579	cement	716	" Roger 's face brightened . "
7593	7598	7589	7589	he	715	" went on Nicholas . "
7601	7605	7589	7589	he	715	" exclaimed Roger , "
7630	7636	7623	7623	she	709	" Nicholas licked his lips . "
7643	7653	7639	7641	a pretty woman	718	" and he waved aside a crossing - sweeper . "
7662	7667	7668	7668	She	709	" asked Roger presently . "
7678	7679	7680	7680	Ann	169	" "
7684	7688	7680	7680	Ann	169	" replied Nicholas , "
7715	7716	7705	7705	he	164	" "
7719	7724	7705	7705	he	164	" said Roger again ; "
7737	7770	7735	7735	Dartie	187	" His pleasant colour was heightened by exercise , he swung his umbrella to the level of his eye more frequently than ever . Nicholas 's face also wore a pleasant look . "
7776	7780	7735	7735	Dartie	187	" he said , "
7786	7792	7795	7795	her	709	" Roger made no reply . "
7800	7816	7795	7795	her	709	" he said at last - it was the highest praise in the Forsyte vocabulary . "
7868	7874	7862	7862	Timothy	170	" They entered the station . "
7885	7886	7881	7881	I	0	" "
7892	7897	7881	7881	I	0	" said Nicholas ; - "
7906	8622	8623	8623	He	722	" He took a first - class ticket to Notting Hill Gate ; Roger a second to South Kensington . The train coming in a minute later , the two brothers parted and entered their respective compartments . Each felt aggrieved that the other had not modified his habits to secure his society a little longer ; but as Roger voiced it in his thoughts : ' Always a stubborn beggar , Nick ! ' And as Nicholas expressed it to himself : ' Cantankerous chap Roger - always was ! ' There was little sentimentality about the Forsytes . In that great London , which they had conquered and become merged in , what time had they to be sentimental ? CHAPTER II - OLD JOLYON GOES TO THE OPERA At five o'clock the following day old Jolyon sat alone , a cigar between his lips , and on a table by his side a cup of tea . He was tired , and before he had finished his cigar he fell asleep . A fly settled on his hair , his breathing sounded heavy in the drowsy silence , his upper lip under the white moustache puffed in and out . From between the fingers of his veined and wrinkled hand the cigar , dropping on the empty hearth , burned itself out . The gloomy little study , with windows of stained glass to exclude the view , was full of dark green velvet and heavily - carved mahogany - a suite of which old Jolyon was wo nt to say : ' Should n't wonder if it made a big price some day ! ' It was pleasant to think that in the after life he could get more for things than he had given . In the rich brown atmosphere peculiar to back rooms in the mansion of a Forsyte , the Rembrandtesque effect of his great head , with its white hair , against the cushion of his high - backed seat , was spoiled by the moustache , which imparted a somewhat military look to his face . An old clock that had been with him since before his marriage forty years ago kept with its ticking a jealous record of the seconds slipping away forever from its old master . He had never cared for this room , hardly going into it from one year 's end to another , except to take cigars from the Japanese cabinet in the corner , and the room now had its revenge . His temples , curving like thatches over the hollows beneath , his cheek - bones and chin , all were sharpened in his sleep , and there had come upon his face the confession that he was an old man . He woke . June had gone ! James had said he would be lonely . James had always been a poor thing . He recollected with satisfaction that he had bought that house over James 's head . Serve him right for sticking at the price ; the only thing the fellow thought of was money . Had he given too much , though ? It wanted a lot of doing to - He dared say he would want all his money before he had done with this affair of June 's . He ought never to have allowed the engagement . She had met this Bosinney at the house of Baynes , Baynes and Bildeboy , the architects . He believed that Baynes , whom he knew - a bit of an old woman - was the young man 's uncle by marriage . After that she 'd been always running after him ; and when she took a thing into her head there was no stopping her . She was continually taking up with ' lame ducks ' of one sort or another . This fellow had no money , but she must needs become engaged to him - a harumscarum , unpractical chap , who would get himself into no end of difficulties . She had come to him one day in her slap - dash way and told him ; and , as if it were any consolation , she had added : "
8638	8639	8628	8628	he	722	" "
8650	8651	8641	8641	he	722	" "
8663	8756	8655	8655	he	722	" Old Jolyon had taken his cigar from under his white moustaches , stained by coffee at the edge , and looked at her , that little slip of a thing who had got such a grip of his heart . He knew more about ' swims ' than his granddaughter . But she , having clasped her hands on his knees , rubbed her chin against him , making a sound like a purring cat . And , knocking the ash off his cigar , he had exploded in nervous desperation : "
8792	8821	8785	8785	I	0	" So , he had washed his hands of it , making the condition that they should not marry until Bosinney had at least four hundred a year . "
8833	8847	8822	8822	I	0	" he had said , a formula to which June was not unaccustomed . "
8860	9510	8852	8852	his	0	" He had hardly seen anything of her since it began . A bad business ! He had no notion of giving her a lot of money to enable a fellow he knew nothing about to live on in idleness . He had seen that sort of thing before ; no good ever came of it . Worst of all , he had no hope of shaking her resolution ; she was as obstinate as a mule , always had been from a child . He did n't see where it was to end . They must cut their coat according to their cloth . He would not give way till he saw young Bosinney with an income of his own . That June would have trouble with the fellow was as plain as a pikestaff ; he had no more idea of money than a cow . As to this rushing down to Wales to visit the young man 's aunts , he fully expected they were old cats . And , motionless , old Jolyon stared at the wall ; but for his open eyes , he might have been asleep .... The idea of supposing that young cub Soames could give him advice ! He had always been a cub , with his nose in the air ! He would be setting up as a man of property next , with a place in the country ! A man of property ! H'mph ! Like his father , he was always nosing out bargains , a cold - blooded young beggar ! He rose , and , going to the cabinet , began methodically stocking his cigar - case from a bundle fresh in . They were not bad at the price , but you could n't get a good cigar , nowadays , nothing to hold a candle to those old Superfinos of Hanson and Bridger 's . That was a cigar ! The thought , like some stealing perfume , carried him back to those wonderful nights at Richmond when after dinner he sat smoking on the terrace of the Crown and Sceptre with Nicholas Treffry and Traquair and Jack Herring and Anthony Thornworthy . How good his cigars were then ! Poor old Nick ! - dead , and Jack Herring - dead , and Traquair - dead of that wife of his , and Thornworthy - awfully shaky no wonder , with his appetite . Of all the company of those days he himself alone seemed left , except Swithin , of course , and he so outrageously big there was no doing anything with him . Difficult to believe it was so long ago ; he felt young still ! Of all his thoughts , as he stood there counting his cigars , this was the most poignant , the most bitter . With his white head and his loneliness he had remained young and green at heart . And those Sunday afternoons on Hampstead Heath , when young Jolyon and he went for a stretch along the Spaniard 's Road to Highgate , to Child 's Hill , and back over the Heath again to dine at Jack Straw 's Castle - how delicious his cigars were then ! And such weather ! There was no weather now . When June was a toddler of five , and every other Sunday he took her to the Zoo , away from the society of those two good women , her mother and her grandmother , and at the top of the bear den baited his umbrella with buns for her favourite bears , how sweet his cigars were then ! Cigars ! He had not even succeeded in out - living his palate - the famous palate that in the fifties men swore by , and speaking of him , said : "
9519	9786	8852	8852	his	0	" The palate that in a sense had made his fortune - the fortune of the celebrated tea men , Forsyte and Treffry , whose tea , like no other man 's tea , had a romantic aroma , the charm of a quite singular genuineness . About the house of Forsyte and Treffry in the City had clung an air of enterprise and mystery , of special dealings in special ships , at special ports , with special Orientals . He had worked at that business ! Men did work in those days ! these young pups hardly knew the meaning of the word . He had gone into every detail , known everything that went on , sometimes sat up all night over it . And he had always chosen his agents himself , prided himself on it . His eye for men , he used to say , had been the secret of his success , and the exercise of this masterful power of selection had been the only part of it all that he had really liked . Not a career for a man of his ability . Even now , when the business had been turned into a Limited Liability Company , and was declining he had got out of his shares long ago , he felt a sharp chagrin in thinking of that time . How much better he might have done ! He would have succeeded splendidly at the Bar ! He had even thought of standing for Parliament . How often had not Nicholas Treffry said to him : "
9806	10124	9795	9795	you	727	" Dear old Nick ! Such a good fellow , but a racketty chap ! The notorious Treffry ! He had never taken any care of himself . So he was dead . Old Jolyon counted his cigars with a steady hand , and it came into his mind to wonder if perhaps he had been too careful of himself . He put the cigar - case in the breast of his coat , buttoned it in , and walked up the long flights to his bedroom , leaning on one foot and the other , and helping himself by the bannister . The house was too big . After June was married , if she ever did marry this fellow , as he supposed she would , he would let it and go into rooms . What was the use of keeping half a dozen servants eating their heads off ? The butler came to the ring of his bell - a large man with a beard , a soft tread , and a peculiar capacity for silence . Old Jolyon told him to put his dress clothes out ; he was going to dine at the Club . How long had the carriage been back from taking Miss June to the station ? Since two ? Then let him come round at half - past six ! The Club which old Jolyon entered on the stroke of seven was one of those political institutions of the upper middle class which have seen better days . In spite of being talked about , perhaps in consequence of being talked about , it betrayed a disappointing vitality . People had grown tired of saying that the ' Disunion ' was on its last legs . Old Jolyon would say it , too , yet disregarded the fact in a manner truly irritating to well - constituted Clubmen . "
10133	10142	10127	10127	you	728	" Swithin often asked him with profound vexation . "
10172	10182	10153	10153	You	728	" and , dropping his voice , he added : "
10200	10201	10191	10191	I	0	" "
10208	11472	10202	10202	I	0	" old Jolyon would answer ; but when he did think of it there was always the question of fifty guineas entrance fee , and it would take him four or five years to get in . He continued to think of it . He was too old to be a Liberal , had long ceased to believe in the political doctrines of his Club , had even been known to allude to them as ' wretched stuff , ' and it afforded him pleasure to continue a member in the teeth of principles so opposed to his own . He had always had a contempt for the place , having joined it many years ago when they refused to have him at the ' Hotch Potch ' owing to his being ' in trade . ' As if he were not as good as any of them ! He naturally despised the Club that did take him . The members were a poor lot , many of them in the City - stockbrokers , solicitors , auctioneers - what not ! Like most men of strong character but not too much originality , old Jolyon set small store by the class to which he belonged . Faithfully he followed their customs , social and otherwise , and secretly he thought them ' a common lot . ' Years and philosophy , of which he had his share , had dimmed the recollection of his defeat at the ' Hotch Potch ' ; and now in his thoughts it was enshrined as the Queen of Clubs . He would have been a member all these years himself , but , owing to the slipshod way his proposer , Jack Herring , had gone to work , they had not known what they were doing in keeping him out . Why ! they had taken his son Jo at once , and he believed the boy was still a member ; he had received a letter dated from there eight years ago . He had not been near the ' Disunion ' for months , and the house had undergone the piebald decoration which people bestow on old houses and old ships when anxious to sell them . ' Beastly colour , the smoking - room ! ' he thought . ' The dining - room is good ! ' Its gloomy chocolate , picked out with light green , took his fancy . He ordered dinner , and sat down in the very corner , at the very table perhaps ! things did not progress much at the ' Disunion , ' a Club of almost Radical principles at which he and young Jolyon used to sit twenty - five years ago , when he was taking the latter to Drury Lane , during his holidays . The boy had loved the theatre , and old Jolyon recalled how he used to sit opposite , concealing his excitement under a careful but transparent nonchalance . He ordered himself , too , the very dinner the boy had always chosen - soup , whitebait , cutlets , and a tart . Ah ! if he were only opposite now ! The two had not met for fourteen years . And not for the first time during those fourteen years old Jolyon wondered whether he had been a little to blame in the matter of his son . An unfortunate love - affair with that precious flirt Danae Thornworthy now Danae Pellew , Anthony Thornworthy 's daughter , had thrown him on the rebound into the arms of June 's mother . He ought perhaps to have put a spoke in the wheel of their marriage ; they were too young ; but after that experience of Jo 's susceptibility he had been only too anxious to see him married . And in four years the crash had come ! To have approved his son 's conduct in that crash was , of course , impossible ; reason and training - that combination of potent factors which stood for his principles - told him of this impossibility , and his heart cried out . The grim remorselessness of that business had no pity for hearts . There was June , the atom with flaming hair , who had climbed all over him , twined and twisted herself about him - about his heart that was made to be the plaything and beloved resort of tiny , helpless things . With characteristic insight he saw he must part with one or with the other ; no half - measures could serve in such a situation . In that lay its tragedy . And the tiny , helpless thing prevailed . He would not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds , and so to his son he said good - bye . That good - bye had lasted until now . He had proposed to continue a reduced allowance to young Jolyon , but this had been refused , and perhaps that refusal had hurt him more than anything , for with it had gone the last outlet of his penned - in affection ; and there had come such tangible and solid proof of rupture as only a transaction in property , a bestowal or refusal of such , could supply . His dinner tasted flat . His pint of champagne was dry and bitter stuff , not like the Veuve Clicquots of old days . Over his cup of coffee , he bethought him that he would go to the opera . In the Times , therefore - he had a distrust of other papers - he read the announcement for the evening . It was ' Fidelio . ' Mercifully not one of those new - fangled German pantomimes by that fellow Wagner . Putting on his ancient opera hat , which , with its brim flattened by use , and huge capacity , looked like an emblem of greater days , and , pulling out an old pair of very thin lavender kid gloves smelling strongly of Russia leather , from habitual proximity to the cigar - case in the pocket of his overcoat , he stepped into a hansom . The cab rattled gaily along the streets , and old Jolyon was struck by their unwonted animation . ' The hotels must be doing a tremendous business , ' he thought . A few years ago there had been none of these big hotels . He made a satisfactory reflection on some property he had in the neighbourhood . It must be going up in value by leaps and bounds ! What traffic ! But from that he began indulging in one of those strange impersonal speculations , so uncharacteristic of a Forsyte , wherein lay , in part , the secret of his supremacy amongst them . What atoms men were , and what a lot of them ! And what would become of them all ? He stumbled as he got out of the cab , gave the man his exact fare , walked up to the ticket office to take his stall , and stood there with his purse in his hand - he always carried his money in a purse , never having approved of that habit of carrying it loosely in the pockets , as so many young men did nowadays . The official leaned out , like an old dog from a kennel . "
11475	11483	11486	11488	Mr. Jolyon Forsyte	165	" he said in a surprised voice , "
11559	13067	13068	13070	Mr. Jolyon Forsyte	165	" The colour in old Jolyon 's eyes deepened ; he paid his guinea . They had not forgotten him . He marched in , to the sounds of the overture , like an old war - horse to battle . Folding his opera hat , he sat down , drew out his lavender gloves in the old way , and took up his glasses for a long look round the house . Dropping them at last on his folded hat , he fixed his eyes on the curtain . More poignantly than ever he felt that it was all over and done with him . Where were all the women , the pretty women , the house used to be so full of ? Where was that old feeling in the heart as he waited for one of those great singers ? Where that sensation of the intoxication of life and of his own power to enjoy it all ? The greatest opera - goer of his day ! There was no opera now ! That fellow Wagner had ruined everything ; no melody left , nor any voices to sing it . Ah ! the wonderful singers ! Gone ! He sat watching the old scenes acted , a numb feeling at his heart . From the curl of silver over his ear to the pose of his foot in its elastic - sided patent boot , there was nothing clumsy or weak about old Jolyon . He was as upright - very nearly - as in those old times when he came every night ; his sight was as good - almost as good . But what a feeling of weariness and disillusion ! He had been in the habit all his life of enjoying things , even imperfect things - and there had been many imperfect things - he had enjoyed them all with moderation , so as to keep himself young . But now he was deserted by his power of enjoyment , by his philosophy , and left with this dreadful feeling that it was all done with . Not even the Prisoners ' Chorus , nor Florian 's Song , had the power to dispel the gloom of his loneliness . If Jo were only with him ! The boy must be forty by now . He had wasted fourteen years out of the life of his only son . And Jo was no longer a social pariah . He was married . Old Jolyon had been unable to refrain from marking his appreciation of the action by enclosing his son a cheque for L500 . The cheque had been returned in a letter from the ' Hotch Potch , ' couched in these words . ' MY DEAREST FATHER , ' Your generous gift was welcome as a sign that you might think worse of me . I return it , but should you think fit to invest it for the benefit of the little chap we call him Jolly , who bears our Christian and , by courtesy , our surname , I shall be very glad . ' I hope with all my heart that your health is as good as ever . ' Your loving son , ' Jo . ' The letter was like the boy . He had always been an amiable chap . Old Jolyon had sent this reply : ' MY DEAR JO , ' The sum L500 stands in my books for the benefit of your boy , under the name of Jolyon Forsyte , and will be duly - credited with interest at 5 per cent . I hope that you are doing well . My health remains good at present . ' With love , I am , ' Your affectionate Father , ' JOLYON FORSYTE . ' And every year on the 1st of January he had added a hundred and the interest . The sum was mounting up - next New Year 's Day it would be fifteen hundred and odd pounds ! And it is difficult to say how much satisfaction he had got out of that yearly transaction . But the correspondence had ended . In spite of his love for his son , in spite of an instinct , partly constitutional , partly the result , as in thousands of his class , of the continual handling and watching of affairs , prompting him to judge conduct by results rather than by principle , there was at the bottom of his heart a sort of uneasiness . His son ought , under the circumstances , to have gone to the dogs ; that law was laid down in all the novels , sermons , and plays he had ever read , heard , or witnessed . After receiving the cheque back there seemed to him to be something wrong somewhere . Why had his son not gone to the dogs ? But , then , who could tell ? He had heard , of course - in fact , he had made it his business to find out - that Jo lived in St. John 's Wood , that he had a little house in Wistaria Avenue with a garden , and took his wife about with him into society - a queer sort of society , no doubt - and that they had two children - the little chap they called Jolly considering the circumstances the name struck him as cynical , and old Jolyon both feared and disliked cynicism , and a girl called Holly , born since the marriage . Who could tell what his son 's circumstances really were ? He had capitalized the income he had inherited from his mother 's father and joined Lloyd 's as an underwriter ; he painted pictures , too - water - colours . Old Jolyon knew this , for he had surreptitiously bought them from time to time , after chancing to see his son 's name signed at the bottom of a representation of the river Thames in a dealer 's window . He thought them bad , and did not hang them because of the signature ; he kept them locked up in a drawer . In the great opera - house a terrible yearning came on him to see his son . He remembered the days when he had been wo nt to slide him , in a brown holland suit , to and fro under the arch of his legs ; the times when he ran beside the boy 's pony , teaching him to ride ; the day he first took him to school . He had been a loving , lovable little chap ! After he went to Eton he had acquired , perhaps , a little too much of that desirable manner which old Jolyon knew was only to be obtained at such places and at great expense ; but he had always been companionable . Always a companion , even after Cambridge - a little far off , perhaps , owing to the advantages he had received . Old Jolyon 's feeling towards our public schools and ' Varsities never wavered , and he retained touchingly his attitude of admiration and mistrust towards a system appropriate to the highest in the land , of which he had not himself been privileged to partake .... Now that June had gone and left , or as good as left him , it would have been a comfort to see his son again . Guilty of this treason to his family , his principles , his class , old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the singer . A poor thing - a wretched poor thing ! And the Florian a perfect stick ! It was over . They were easily pleased nowadays ! In the crowded street he snapped up a cab under the very nose of a stout and much younger gentleman , who had already assumed it to be his own . His route lay through Pall Mall , and at the corner , instead of going through the Green Park , the cabman turned to drive up St. James 's Street . Old Jolyon put his hand through the trap he could not bear being taken out of his way ; in turning , however , he found himself opposite the ' Hotch Potch , ' and the yearning that had been secretly with him the whole evening prevailed . He called to the driver to stop . He would go in and ask if Jo still belonged there . He went in . The hall looked exactly as it did when he used to dine there with Jack Herring , and they had the best cook in London ; and he looked round with the shrewd , straight glance that had caused him all his life to be better served than most men . "
13076	13077	13080	13080	sir	730	" "
13092	13099	13100	13101	His father	559	" Old Jolyon was taken aback . "
13103	13233	13100	13101	His father	559	" he said . And having spoken , he took his stand , back to the fireplace . Young Jolyon , on the point of leaving the Club , had put on his hat , and was in the act of crossing the hall , as the porter met him . He was no longer young , with hair going grey , and face - a narrower replica of his father 's , with the same large drooping moustache - decidedly worn . He turned pale . This meeting was terrible after all those years , for nothing in the world was so terrible as a scene . They met and crossed hands without a word . Then , with a quaver in his voice , the father said : "
13241	13246	13236	13236	you	165	" The son answered : "
13253	13265	13251	13251	Dad	223	" Old Jolyon 's hand trembled in its thin lavender glove . "
13273	13277	13251	13251	Dad	223	" he said , "
13285	13456	13278	13278	I	0	" And as though in the habit of taking each other home every night they went out and stepped into the cab . To old Jolyon it seemed that his son had grown . ' More of a man altogether , ' was his comment . Over the natural amiability of that son 's face had come a rather sardonic mask , as though he had found in the circumstances of his life the necessity for armour . The features were certainly those of a Forsyte , but the expression was more the introspective look of a student or philosopher . He had no doubt been obliged to look into himself a good deal in the course of those fifteen years . To young Jolyon the first sight of his father was undoubtedly a shock - he looked so worn and old . But in the cab he seemed hardly to have changed , still having the calm look so well remembered , still being upright and keen - eyed . "
13463	13464	13461	13461	Dad	223	" "
13467	13507	13508	13508	Jo	190	" old Jolyon answered . He was the prey of an anxiety that he found he must put into words . Having got his son back like this , he felt he must know what was his financial position . "
13510	13514	13508	13508	Jo	190	" he said , "
13535	13559	13528	13528	I	0	" He put it this way that his son might find it easier to confess . Young Jolyon answered in his ironical voice : "
13568	13629	13630	13630	June	166	" Old Jolyon saw that he was angry , and touched his hand . He had run a risk . It was worth it , however , and Jo had never been sulky with him . They drove on , without speaking again , to Stanhope Gate . Old Jolyon invited him in , but young Jolyon shook his head . "
13635	13641	13630	13630	June	166	" said his father hastily : "
13663	13664	13656	13656	she	166	" "
13667	13840	13841	13841	She	747	" murmured young Jolyon ' . Old Jolyon stepped out , and , in paying the cab fare , for the first time in his life gave the driver a sovereign in mistake for a shilling . Placing the coin in his mouth , the cabman whipped his horse secretly on the underneath and hurried away . Old Jolyon turned the key softly in the lock , pushed open the door , and beckoned . His son saw him gravely hanging up his coat , with an expression on his face like that of a boy who intends to steal cherries . The door of the dining - room was open , the gas turned low ; a spirit - urn hissed on a tea - tray , and close to it a cynical looking cat had fallen asleep on the dining - table . Old Jolyon ' shoo'd ' her off at once . The incident was a relief to his feelings ; he rattled his opera hat behind the animal . "
13846	13869	13841	13841	She	747	" he said , following her out of the room . Through the door in the hall leading to the basement he called "
13872	13894	13841	13841	She	747	" several times , as though assisting the cat 's departure , till by some strange coincidence the butler appeared below . "
13903	13908	13909	13909	I	0	" said old Jolyon . "
13917	14034	13909	13909	I	0	" When he again entered the dining - room the cat unfortunately preceded him , with her tail in the air , proclaiming that she had seen through this manouevre for suppressing the butler from the first .... A fatality had dogged old Jolyon 's domestic stratagems all his life . Young Jolyon could not help smiling . He was very well versed in irony , and everything that evening seemed to him ironical . The episode of the cat ; the announcement of his own daughter 's engagement . So he had no more part or parcel in her than he had in the Puss ! And the poetical justice of this appealed to him . "
14041	14045	14046	14046	She	166	" he asked . "
14052	14057	14058	14058	they	749	" returned old Jolyon ; "
14084	14085	14071	14071	She	166	" "
14093	14117	14089	14089	she	166	" Old Jolyon was too much of a Forsyte to praise anything freely ; especially anything for which he had a genuine admiration . "
14139	14160	14137	14137	Jo	190	" The look on his face again gave young Jolyon the shock he had felt on first seeing his father . "
14179	14180	14183	14183	myself	0	" "
14185	14197	14183	14183	myself	0	" repeated old Jolyon with an angry break in his voice . "
14222	14230	14217	14217	I	0	" He checked himself , and added : "
14244	14752	14237	14237	I	0	" Young Jolyon looked round the room . It was peculiarly vast and dreary , decorated with the enormous pictures of still life that he remembered as a boy - sleeping dogs with their noses resting on bunches of carrots , together with onions and grapes lying side by side in mild surprise . The house was a white elephant , but he could not conceive of his father living in a smaller place ; and all the more did it all seem ironical . In his great chair with the book - rest sat old Jolyon , the figurehead of his family and class and creed , with his white head and dome - like forehead , the representative of moderation , and order , and love of property . As lonely an old man as there was in London . There he sat in the gloomy comfort of the room , a puppet in the power of great forces that cared nothing for family or class or creed , but moved , machine - like , with dread processes to inscrutable ends . This was how it struck young Jolyon , who had the impersonal eye . The poor old Dad ! So this was the end , the purpose to which he had lived with such magnificent moderation ! To be lonely , and grow older and older , yearning for a soul to speak to ! In his turn old Jolyon looked back at his son . He wanted to talk about many things that he had been unable to talk about all these years . It had been impossible to seriously confide in June his conviction that property in the Soho quarter would go up in value ; his uneasiness about that tremendous silence of Pippin , the superintendent of the New Colliery Company , of which he had so long been chairman ; his disgust at the steady fall in American Golgothas , or even to discuss how , by some sort of settlement , he could best avoid the payment of those death duties which would follow his decease . Under the influence , however , of a cup of tea , which he seemed to stir indefinitely , he began to speak at last . A new vista of life was thus opened up , a promised land of talk , where he could find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and regret ; where he could soothe his soul with the opium of devising how to round off his property and make eternal the only part of him that was to remain alive . Young Jolyon was a good listener ; it was his great quality . He kept his eyes fixed on his father 's face , putting a question now and then . The clock struck one before old Jolyon had finished , and at the sound of its striking his principles came back . He took out his watch with a look of surprise : "
14761	14794	14759	14759	Jo	190	" he said . Young Jolyon rose and held out his hand to help his father up . The old face looked worn and hollow again ; the eyes were steadily averted . "
14807	15532	15533	15533	Adolf	228	" A moment passed , and young Jolyon , turning on his , heel , marched out at the door . He could hardly see ; his smile quavered . Never in all the fifteen years since he had first found out that life was no simple business , had he found it so singularly complicated . CHAPTER III - DINNER AT SWITHIN 'S In Swithin 's orange and light - blue dining - room , facing the Park , the round table was laid for twelve . A cut - glass chandelier filled with lighted candles hung like a giant stalactite above its centre , radiating over large gilt - framed mirrors , slabs of marble on the tops of side - tables , and heavy gold chairs with crewel worked seats . Everything betokened that love of beauty so deeply implanted in each family which has had its own way to make into Society , out of the more vulgar heart of Nature . Swithin had indeed an impatience of simplicity , a love of ormolu , which had always stamped him amongst his associates as a man of great , if somewhat luxurious taste ; and out of the knowledge that no one could possibly enter his rooms without perceiving him to be a man of wealth , he had derived a solid and prolonged happiness such as perhaps no other circumstance in life had afforded him . Since his retirement from land agency , a profession deplorable in his estimation , especially as to its auctioneering department , he had abandoned himself to naturally aristocratic tastes . The perfect luxury of his latter days had embedded him like a fly in sugar ; and his mind , where very little took place from morning till night , was the junction of two curiously opposite emotions , a lingering and sturdy satisfaction that he had made his own way and his own fortune , and a sense that a man of his distinction should never have been allowed to soil his mind with work . He stood at the sideboard in a white waistcoat with large gold and onyx buttons , watching his valet screw the necks of three champagne bottles deeper into ice - pails . Between the points of his stand - up collar , which - though it hurt him to move - he would on no account have had altered , the pale flesh of his under chin remained immovable . His eyes roved from bottle to bottle . He was debating , and he argued like this : Jolyon drinks a glass , perhaps two , he 's so careful of himself . James , he ca n't take his wine nowadays . Nicholas - Fanny and he would swill water he should n't wonder ! Soames did n't count ; these young nephews - Soames was thirty - one - could n't drink ! But Bosinney ? Encountering in the name of this stranger something outside the range of his philosophy , Swithin paused . A misgiving arose within him ! It was impossible to tell ! June was only a girl , in love too ! Emily Mrs. James liked a good glass of champagne . It was too dry for Juley , poor old soul , she had no palate . As to Hatty Chessman ! The thought of this old friend caused a cloud of thought to obscure the perfect glassiness of his eyes : He should n't wonder if she drank half a bottle ! But in thinking of his remaining guest , an expression like that of a cat who is just going to purr stole over his old face : Mrs. Soames ! She might n't take much , but she would appreciate what she drank ; it was a pleasure to give her good wine ! A pretty woman - and sympathetic to him ! The thought of her was like champagne itself ! A pleasure to give a good wine to a young woman who looked so well , who knew how to dress , with charming manners , quite distinguished - a pleasure to entertain her . Between the points of his collar he gave his head the first small , painful oscillation of the evening . "
15535	15539	15533	15533	Adolf	228	" he said . "
15545	15601	15602	15602	Adolf	228	" He himself might drink a good deal , for , thanks to that prescription of Blight 's , he found himself extremely well , and he had been careful to take no lunch . He had not felt so well for weeks . Puffing out his lower lip , he gave his last instructions : "
15618	15781	15782	15783	Mrs. Chessman	229	" Passing into the anteroom , he sat down on the edge of a chair , with his knees apart ; and his tall , bulky form was wrapped at once in an expectant , strange , primeval immobility . He was ready to rise at a moment 's notice . He had not given a dinner - party for months . This dinner in honour of June 's engagement had seemed a bore at first among Forsytes the custom of solemnizing engagements by feasts was religiously observed , but the labours of sending invitations and ordering the repast over , he felt pleasantly stimulated . And thus sitting , a watch in his hand , fat , and smooth , and golden , like a flattened globe of butter , he thought of nothing . A long man , with side whiskers , who had once been in Swithin 's service , but was now a greengrocer , entered and proclaimed : "
15789	15843	15785	15787	Mrs. Septimus Small	177	" Two ladies advanced . The one in front , habited entirely in red , had large , settled patches of the same colour in her cheeks , and a hard , dashing eye . She walked at Swithin , holding out a hand cased in a long , primrose - coloured glove : "
15848	15852	15846	15846	Swithin	172	" she said , "
15877	15936	15939	15939	Juley	176	" The fixity of Swithin 's eye alone betrayed emotion . A dumb and grumbling anger swelled his bosom . It was vulgar to be stout , to talk of being stout ; he had a chest , nothing more . Turning to his sister , he grasped her hand , and said in a tone of command : "
15941	16450	15939	15939	Juley	176	" Mrs. Septimus Small was the tallest of the four sisters ; her good , round old face had gone a little sour ; an innumerable pout clung all over it , as if it had been encased in an iron wire mask up to that evening , which , being suddenly removed , left little rolls of mutinous flesh all over her countenance . Even her eyes were pouting . It was thus that she recorded her permanent resentment at the loss of Septimus Small . She had quite a reputation for saying the wrong thing , and , tenacious like all her breed , she would hold to it when she had said it , and add to it another wrong thing , and so on . With the decease of her husband the family tenacity , the family matter - of - factness , had gone sterile within her . A great talker , when allowed , she would converse without the faintest animation for hours together , relating , with epic monotony , the innumerable occasions on which Fortune had misused her ; nor did she ever perceive that her hearers sympathized with Fortune , for her heart was kind . Having sat , poor soul , long by the bedside of Small a man of poor constitution , she had acquired , the habit , and there were countless subsequent occasions when she had sat immense periods of time to amuse sick people , children , and other helpless persons , and she could never divest herself of the feeling that the world was the most ungrateful place anybody could live in . Sunday after Sunday she sat at the feet of that extremely witty preacher , the Rev. Thomas Scoles , who exercised a great influence over her ; but she succeeded in convincing everybody that even this was a misfortune . She had passed into a proverb in the family , and when anybody was observed to be peculiarly distressing , he was known as a regular ' Juley . ' The habit of her mind would have killed anybody but a Forsyte at forty ; but she was seventy - two , and had never looked better . And one felt that there were capacities for enjoyment about her which might yet come out . She owned three canaries , the cat Tommy , and half a parrot - in common with her sister Hester ; - and these poor creatures kept carefully out of Timothy 's way - he was nervous about animals , unlike human beings , recognising that she could not help being blighted , attached themselves to her passionately . She was sombrely magnificent this evening in black bombazine , with a mauve front cut in a shy triangle , and crowned with a black velvet ribbon round the base of her thin throat ; black and mauve for evening wear was esteemed very chaste by nearly every Forsyte . Pouting at Swithin , she said : "
16468	16483	16458	16458	You	755	" Swithin put his thumbs within the armholes of his waistcoat , and replied : "
16497	16498	16499	16499	Mr.	758	" "
16505	16660	16501	16503	Mrs. Nicholas Forsyte	189	" Nicholas Forsyte , cocking his rectangular eyebrows , wore a smile . He had succeeded during the day in bringing to fruition a scheme for the employment of a tribe from Upper India in the gold - mines of Ceylon . A pet plan , carried at last in the teeth of great difficulties - he was justly pleased . It would double the output of his mines , and , as he had often forcibly argued , all experience tended to show that a man must die ; and whether he died of a miserable old age in his own country , or prematurely of damp in the bottom of a foreign mine , was surely of little consequence , provided that by a change in his mode of life he benefited the British Empire . His ability was undoubted . Raising his broken nose towards his listener , he would add : "
16697	16736	16688	16688	I	0	" He had been at Yarmouth , too , and had come back feeling that he had added at least ten years to his own life . He grasped Swithin 's hand , exclaiming in a jocular voice : "
16745	16763	16764	16764	Mr.	762	" Mrs. Nicholas , an effete woman , smiled a smile of frightened jollity behind his back . "
16776	16788	16772	16774	Mrs. Soames Forsyte	232	" Swithin drew his heels together , his deportment ever admirable . "
16807	16969	16804	16804	you	231	" His hand enclosed Irene 's , and his eyes swelled . She was a pretty woman - a little too pale , but her figure , her eyes , her teeth ! Too good for that chap Soames ! The gods had given Irene dark brown eyes and golden hair , that strange combination , provocative of men 's glances , which is said to be the mark of a weak character . And the full , soft pallor of her neck and shoulders , above a gold - coloured frock , gave to her personality an alluring strangeness . Soames stood behind , his eyes fastened on his wife 's neck . The hands of Swithin 's watch , which he still held open in his hand , had left eight behind ; it was half an hour beyond his dinner - time - he had had no lunch - and a strange primeval impatience surged up within him . "
16979	16989	16974	16974	Jolyon	167	" he said to Irene , with uncontrollable vexation . "
16999	17000	16995	16995	June	166	" "
17008	17024	17025	17025	They	764	" she answered . Swithin stared at her ; a dusky orange dyed his cheeks . "
17036	17053	16995	16995	June	166	" And behind this outburst the inarticulate violence of primitive generations seemed to mutter and grumble . "
17067	17121	17057	17057	you	765	" said Irene softly . Among the lace in the bosom of her dress was shining a five - pointed star , made of eleven diamonds . Swithin looked at the star . He had a pretty taste in stones ; no question could have been more sympathetically devised to distract his attention . "
17127	17131	17132	17132	Soames	232	" he asked . "
17134	17160	17132	17132	Soames	232	" There was no change in her face , but Swithin 's pale eyes bulged as though he might suddenly have been afflicted with insight . "
17170	17174	17161	17161	I	0	" he said . "
17203	17204	17205	17207	Miss June Forsyte	166	" "
17218	17231	17214	17215	Mr. Boswainey	234	" Swithin moved his arm , and said in a rumbling voice : "
17238	17436	17214	17215	Mr. Boswainey	234	" He took in Irene , on the ground that he had not entertained her since she was a bride . June was the portion of Bosinney , who was placed between Irene and his fiancee . On the other side of June was James with Mrs. Nicholas , then old Jolyon with Mrs. James , Nicholas with Hatty Chessman , Soames with Mrs. Small , completing , the circle to Swithin again . Family dinners of the Forsytes observe certain traditions . There are , for instance , no hors d'oeuvre . The reason for this is unknown . Theory among the younger members traces it to the disgraceful price of oysters ; it is more probably due to a desire to come to the point , to a good practical sense deciding at once that hors d'oeuvre are but poor things . The Jameses alone , unable to withstand a custom almost universal in Park Lane , are now and then unfaithful . A silent , almost morose , inattention to each other succeeds to the subsidence into their seats , lasting till well into the first entree , but interspersed with remarks such as , "
17453	17454	17442	17442	I	0	" "
17466	17468	17457	17457	Ann	169	" - "
17479	17480	17477	17477	Fanny	226	" "
17483	17484	17485	17485	He	182	" "
17490	17492	17485	17485	He	182	" - "
17516	17518	17508	17508	She	768	" - "
17533	17825	17826	17826	You	770	" With the second glass of champagne , a kind of hum makes itself heard , which , when divested of casual accessories and resolved into its primal element , is found to be James telling a story , and this goes on for a long time , encroaching sometimes even upon what must universally be recognised as the crowning point of a Forsyte feast - ' the saddle of mutton . ' No Forsyte has given a dinner without providing a saddle of mutton . There is something in its succulent solidity which makes it suitable to people ' of a certain position . ' It is nourishing and tasty ; the sort of thing a man remembers eating . It has a past and a future , like a deposit paid into a bank ; and it is something that can be argued about . Each branch of the family tenaciously held to a particular locality - old Jolyon swearing by Dartmoor , James by Welsh , Swithin by Southdown , Nicholas maintaining that people might sneer , but there was nothing like New Zealand ! As for Roger , the ' original ' of the brothers , he had been obliged to invent a locality of his own , and with an ingenuity worthy of a man who had devised a new profession for his sons , he had discovered a shop where they sold German ; on being remonstrated with , he had proved his point by producing a butcher 's bill , which showed that he paid more than any of the others . It was on this occasion that old Jolyon , turning to June , had said in one of his bursts of philosophy : "
17853	18236	18267	18267	he	773	" Timothy alone held apart , for though he ate saddle of mutton heartily , he was , he said , afraid of it . To anyone interested psychologically in Forsytes , this great saddle - of - mutton trait is of prime importance ; not only does it illustrate their tenacity , both collectively and as individuals , but it marks them as belonging in fibre and instincts to that great class which believes in nourishment and flavour , and yields to no sentimental craving for beauty . Younger members of the family indeed would have done without a joint altogether , preferring guinea - fowl , or lobster salad - something which appealed to the imagination , and had less nourishment - but these were females ; or , if not , had been corrupted by their wives , or by mothers , who having been forced to eat saddle of mutton throughout their married lives , had passed a secret hostility towards it into the fibre of their sons . The great saddle - of - mutton controversy at an end , a Tewkesbury ham commenced , together with the least touch of West Indian - Swithin was so long over this course that he caused a block in the progress of the dinner . To devote himself to it with better heart , he paused in his conversation . From his seat by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching . He had a reason of his own connected with a pet building scheme , for observing Bosinney . The architect might do for his purpose ; he looked clever , as he sat leaning back in his chair , moodily making little ramparts with bread - crumbs . Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut , but too small , as though made many years ago . He saw him turn to Irene and say something and her face sparkle as he often saw it sparkle at other people - never at himself . He tried to catch what they were saying , but Aunt Juley was speaking . Had n't that always seemed very extraordinary to Soames ? Only last Sunday dear Mr. Scole , had been so witty in his sermon , so sarcastic , "
18240	18264	18267	18267	he	773	" he had said , ' shall it profit a man if he gain his own soul , but lose all his property ? "
18316	18333	18312	18312	He	773	" How should I know ? Scoles is a humbug , though , is n't he ? "
18430	18438	18440	18440	Soames	177	" Well , and so they are ! "
18479	18488	18489	18489	he	233	" Where do you go for your mushrooms ? "
18502	18529	18489	18489	he	233	" you ought to go to Smileybob 's - he 'll give 'em you fresh . These little men , they wo n't take the trouble ! "
18633	18656	18623	18623	she	166	" I stayed on the river on my way home , Uncle James , and saw a beautiful site for a house . "
18671	18674	18675	18675	he	241	" Eh ? "
18678	18685	18675	18675	he	241	" Now , where was that ? "
18686	18691	18692	18692	James	241	" Close to Pangbourne . "
18706	18721	18722	18722	he	241	" I suppose you would n't know whether the land about there was freehold ? "
18727	18741	18722	18722	he	241	" You would n't know anything about the price of land about there ? "
18742	18745	18747	18747	June	166	" Yes , "
18749	18754	18747	18747	June	166	" I made inquiries . "
18779	18790	18791	18791	he	241	" What ? You 're not thinking of buying land ! "
18827	18832	18833	18833	she	166	" Of course not , "
18836	18859	18833	18833	she	166	" I thought it would be such a splendid place for - you or - someone to build a country - house ! "
18877	18887	18888	18888	he	241	" Land ought to be very dear about there , "
18937	18967	18920	18920	she	166	" You ought to go into the country , Uncle James . I wish I had a lot of money , I would n't live another day in London . "
18991	19001	19003	19003	June	166	" Why do n't you go into the country ? "
19005	19015	19003	19003	June	166	" it would do you a lot of good . "
19016	19019	19021	19021	James	241	" Why ? "
19026	19056	19021	19021	James	241	" Buying land - what good d'you suppose I can do buying land , building houses ? - I could n't get four per cent . for my money ! "
19057	19069	19003	19003	June	166	" What does that matter ? You 'd get fresh air . "
19070	19074	19076	19076	James	241	" Fresh air ! "
19078	19087	19076	19076	James	241	" what should I do with fresh air , "
19088	19100	19102	19102	June	166	" I should have thought anybody liked to have fresh air , "
19114	19124	19125	19125	he	241	" You do n't know the value of money , "
19132	19142	19125	19125	he	241	" No ! and I hope I never shall ! "
19487	19499	19502	19502	his	241	" I hope I shall never know the value of money ! "
20136	20140	20141	20141	June	166	" Who cares ? "
20144	20160	20141	20141	June	166	" let him do what he likes - you 've only to stick to it ! "
20420	20429	20430	20430	he	241	" I gave four hundred pounds for it , "
20434	20445	20430	20430	he	241	" Of course it 's a regular work of art . "
20446	20459	20462	20462	Nicholas	226	" Four hundred ! H'm ! that 's a lot of money ! "
20586	20602	20579	20579	he	163	" Four hundred fiddlesticks ! Do n't tell me you gave four hundred for that ? "
20622	20656	20579	20579	he	163	" Four - hundred - pounds , of English money ; not a farthing less . I do n't regret it . It 's not common English - it 's genuine modern Italian ! "
20696	20706	20708	20708	James	241	" There 's a lot of work about it , "
20722	20731	20708	20708	James	241	" It 'd sell well at Jobson 's . "
20732	20743	20746	20746	Swithin	233	" The poor foreign dey - vil that made it , "
20748	20774	20746	20746	Swithin	233	" asked me five hundred - I gave him four . It 's worth eight . Looked half - starved , poor dey - vil ! "
20775	20778	20781	20781	Nicholas	226	" Ah ! "
20784	20845	20781	20781	Nicholas	226	" poor , seedy - lookin ' chaps , these artists ; it 's a wonder to me how they live . Now , there 's young Flageoletti , that Fanny and the girls are always hav'in ' in , to play the fiddle ; if he makes a hundred a year it 's as much as ever he does ! "
20851	20854	20855	20855	he	233	" Ah ! "
20858	20867	20855	20855	he	233	" I do n't know how they live ! "
20888	20897	20898	20898	he	233	" Would n't have given two for it ! "
20984	21004	20977	20977	Swithin	233	" You never knew anything about a statue . You 've got your pictures , and that 's all ! "
21057	21060	21063	21063	he	163	" Stucco ! "
21085	21104	21077	21077	his	233	" Stucco ! I should like to see anything you 've got in your house half as good ! "
21128	21154	21122	21122	James	241	" Now , what do you say , Mr. Bosinney ? You 're an architect ; you ought to know all about statues and things ! "
21185	21195	21174	21175	And Soames	177	" Yes , Bosinney , what do you say ? "
21200	21208	21196	21196	Bosinney	168	" The work is a remarkable one . "
21229	21234	21225	21225	Soames	177	" Remarkable for what ? "
21235	21239	21216	21216	his	233	" For its naivete "
22726	22733	22710	22710	he	249	" One of the new school . "
22734	22737	22710	22710	he	249	" Clever ? "
22738	22755	22756	22756	He	249	" As clever as you like - a bit - a bit up in the air ! "
23478	23507	23465	23465	Soames	164	" If you 've nothing better to do on Sunday , come down with me to Robin Hill , and give me your opinion on a building site . "
23508	23515	23445	23446	the architect	2700	" Are you going to build ? "
23516	23519	23521	23521	Soames	164	" Perhaps , "
23523	23537	23521	23521	Soames	164	" but do n't speak of it . I just want your opinion . "
23538	23542	23544	23545	the architect	2700	" Quite so , "
23553	23561	23562	23562	he	164	" You 're rather high up here , "
23586	23596	23598	23599	the architect	2700	" It does well enough for me so far , "
23601	23609	23598	23599	the architect	2700	" You 're accustomed to the swells . "
23649	23660	23662	23662	he	164	" What do you pay for an office like this ? "
23664	23669	23671	23671	Bosinney	168	" Fifty too much , "
23679	23686	23687	23687	he	164	" I suppose it is dear , "
23690	23702	23687	23687	he	164	" I 'll call for you - on Sunday about eleven . "
23784	23788	23790	23790	Soames	164	" Gravel soil , "
23899	23904	23905	23905	he	164	" I told you , "
23908	23939	23905	23905	he	164	" that I want this house to be a surprise , so do n't say anything about it . I never talk of my affairs until they 're carried through . "
23943	23950	23905	23905	he	164	" Let women into your plans , "
23954	23964	23905	23905	he	164	" and you never know where it 'll end . "
23965	23968	23970	23970	Bosinney	168	" Ah ! "
23972	23978	23970	23970	Bosinney	168	" women are the devil ! "
24004	24007	24008	24008	he	164	" Oh ! "
24018	24032	24033	24033	June	166	" He stopped , but added , with an uncontrollable burst of spite : "
24045	24046	24039	24039	her	166	" "
24058	24229	24230	24231	The agent	943	" Soames had never called Irene an angel . He could not so have violated his best instincts , letting other people into the secret of her value , and giving himself away . He made no reply . They had struck into a half - made road across a warren . A cart - track led at right - angles to a gravel pit , beyond which the chimneys of a cottage rose amongst a clump of trees at the border of a thick wood . Tussocks of feathery grass covered the rough surface of the ground , and out of these the larks soared into the hate of sunshine . On the far horizon , over a countless succession of fields and hedges , rose a line of downs . Soames led till they had crossed to the far side , and there he stopped . It was the chosen site ; but now that he was about to divulge the spot to another he had become uneasy . "
24237	24241	24242	24242	he	943	" he said ; "
24261	24332	24242	24242	he	943	" He again took the lead to the cottage , where the agent , a tall man named Oliver , with a heavy face and grizzled beard , welcomed them . During lunch , which Soames hardly touched , he kept looking at Bosinney , and once or twice passed his silk handkerchief stealthily over his forehead . The meal came to an end at last , and Bosinney rose . "
24344	24348	24333	24333	I	0	" he said ; "
24359	24420	24421	24421	Your	0	" Without waiting for a reply he strolled out . Soames was solicitor to this estate , and he spent nearly an hour in the agent 's company , looking at ground - plans and discussing the Nicholl and other mortgages ; it was as it were by an afterthought that he brought up the question of the building site . "
24424	24428	24421	24421	Your	0	" he said , "
24449	24467	24434	24434	their	946	" Oliver shook his head . The site you 've fixed on , Sir , he said , "
24489	24490	24434	24434	their	946	" "
24493	24497	24434	24434	their	946	" said Soames , "
24521	24522	24434	24434	their	946	" "
24589	24631	24632	24632	I	0	" They looked at each other . Their faces said very plainly : ' I respect you as a man of business ; and you ca n't expect me to believe a word you say . ' Well , repeated Soames , "
24648	25023	24632	24632	I	0	" With these words , taking up his umbrella , he put his chilly hand into the agent 's , withdrew it without the faintest pressure , and went out into the sun . He walked slowly back towards the site in deep thought . His instinct told him that what the agent had said was true . A cheap site . And the beauty of it was , that he knew the agent did not really think it cheap ; so that his own intuitive knowledge was a victory over the agent 's . ' Cheap or not , I mean to have it , ' he thought . The larks sprang up in front of his feet , the air was full of butterflies , a sweet fragrance rose from the wild grasses . The sappy scent of the bracken stole forth from the wood , where , hidden in the depths , pigeons were cooing , and from afar on the warm breeze , came the rhythmic chiming of church bells . Soames walked with his eyes on the ground , his lips opening and closing as though in anticipation of a delicious morsel . But when he arrived at the site , Bosinney was nowhere to be seen . After waiting some little time , he crossed the warren in the direction of the slope . He would have shouted , but dreaded the sound of his voice . The warren was as lonely as a prairie , its silence only broken by the rustle of rabbits bolting to their holes , and the song of the larks . Soames , the pioneer - leader of the great Forsyte army advancing to the civilization of this wilderness , felt his spirit daunted by the loneliness , by the invisible singing , and the hot , sweet air . He had begun to retrace his steps when he at last caught sight of Bosinney . The architect was sprawling under a large oak tree , whose trunk , with a huge spread of bough and foliage , ragged with age , stood on the verge of the rise . Soames had to touch him on the shoulder before he looked up . "
25028	25032	25026	25026	Forsyte	165	" he said , "
25046	25058	25059	25059	You	165	" Soames stood and looked , then he said , coldly : "
25076	25077	25082	25082	man	956	" "
25089	25384	25385	25385	I	0	" Almost from their feet stretched ripe corn , dipping to a small dark copse beyond . A plain of fields and hedges spread to the distant grey - bluedowns . In a silver streak to the right could be seen the line of the river . The sky was so blue , and the sun so bright , that an eternal summer seemed to reign over this prospect . Thistledown floated round them , enraptured by the serenity , of the ether . The heat danced over the corn , and , pervading all , was a soft , insensible hum , like the murmur of bright minutes holding revel between earth and heaven . Soames looked . In spite of himself , something swelled in his breast . To live here in sight of all this , to be able to point it out to his friends , to talk of it , to possess it ! His cheeks flushed . The warmth , the radiance , the glow , were sinking into his senses as , four years before , Irene 's beauty had sunk into his senses and made him long for her . He stole a glance at Bosinney , whose eyes , the eyes of the coachman 's ' half - tame leopard , ' seemed running wild over the landscape . The sunlight had caught the promontories of the fellow 's face , the bumpy cheekbones , the point of his chin , the vertical ridges above his brow ; and Soames watched this rugged , enthusiastic , careless face with an unpleasant feeling . A long , soft ripple of wind flowed over the corn , and brought a puff of warm air into their faces . "
25393	25403	25385	25385	I	0	" said Bosinney , breaking the silence at last . "
25408	25414	25385	25385	I	0	" replied Soames , drily . "
25424	25425	25415	25415	You	0	" "
25437	25461	25462	25462	I	0	" Soames had become very pale - a struggle was going on within him . He dropped his eyes , and said stubbornly : "
25468	25529	25462	25462	I	0	" And slowly , with his mousing walk , he led the way back to the first site . They spent some time there going into particulars of the projected house , and then Soames returned to the agent 's cottage . He came out in about half an hour , and , joining Bosinney , started for the station . "
25532	25541	25462	25462	I	0	" he said , hardly opening his lips , "
25553	27315	25548	25548	yours	960	" And again he was silent , confusedly debating how it was that this fellow , whom by habit he despised , should have overborne his own decision . CHAPTER V - A FORSYTE MENAGE Like the enlightened thousands of his class and generation in this great city of London , who no longer believe in red velvet chairs , and know that groups of modern Italian marble are ' vieux jeu , ' Soames Forsyte inhabited a house which did what it could . It owned a copper door knocker of individual design , windows which had been altered to open outwards , hanging flower boxes filled with fuchsias , and at the back a great feature a little court tiled with jade - green tiles , and surrounded by pink hydrangeas in peacock - blue tubs . Here , under a parchment - coloured Japanese sunshade covering the whole end , inhabitants or visitors could be screened from the eyes of the curious while they drank tea and examined at their leisure the latest of Soames 's little silver boxes . The inner decoration favoured the First Empire and William Morris . For its size , the house was commodious ; there were countless nooks resembling birds ' nests , and little things made of silver were deposited like eggs . In this general perfection two kinds of fastidiousness were at war . There lived here a mistress who would have dwelt daintily on a desert island ; a master whose daintiness was , as it were , an investment , cultivated by the owner for his advancement , in accordance with the laws of competition . This competitive daintiness had caused Soames in his Marlborough days to be the first boy into white waistcoats in summer , and corduroy waistcoats in winter , had prevented him from ever appearing in public with his tie climbing up his collar , and induced him to dust his patent leather boots before a great multitude assembled on Speech Day to hear him recite Moliere . Skin - like immaculateness had grown over Soames , as over many Londoners ; impossible to conceive of him with a hair out of place , a tie deviating one - eighth of an inch from the perpendicular , a collar unglossed ! He would not have gone without a bath for worlds - it was the fashion to take baths ; and how bitter was his scorn of people who omitted them ! But Irene could be imagined , like some nymph , bathing in wayside streams , for the joy of the freshness and of seeing her own fair body . In this conflict throughout the house the woman had gone to the wall . As in the struggle between Saxon and Celt still going on within the nation , the more impressionable and receptive temperament had had forced on it a conventional superstructure . Thus the house had acquired a close resemblance to hundreds of other houses with the same high aspirations , having become : ' That very charming little house of the Soames Forsytes , quite individual , my dear - really elegant . ' For Soames Forsyte - read James Peabody , Thomas Atkins , or Emmanuel Spagnoletti , the name in fact of any upper - middle class Englishman in London with any pretensions to taste ; and though the decoration be different , the phrase is just . On the evening of August 8 , a week after the expedition to Robin Hill , in the dining - room of this house - ' quite individual , my dear - really elegant ' - Soames and Irene were seated at dinner . A hot dinner on Sundays was a little distinguishing elegance common to this house and many others . Early in married life Soames had laid down the rule : ' The servants must give us hot dinner on Sundays - they 've nothing to do but play the concertina . ' The custom had produced no revolution . For - to Soames a rather deplorable sign - servants were devoted to Irene , who , in defiance of all safe tradition , appeared to recognise their right to a share in the weaknesses of human nature . The happy pair were seated , not opposite each other , but rectangularly , at the handsome rosewood table ; they dined without a cloth - a distinguishing elegance - and so far had not spoken a word . Soames liked to talk during dinner about business , or what he had been buying , and so long as he talked Irene 's silence did not distress him . This evening he had found it impossible to talk . The decision to build had been weighing on his mind all the week , and he had made up his mind to tell her . His nervousness about this disclosure irritated him profoundly ; she had no business to make him feel like that - a wife and a husband being one person . She had not looked at him once since they sat down ; and he wondered what on earth she had been thinking about all the time . It was hard , when a man worked as he did , making money for her - yes , and with an ache in his heart - that she should sit there , looking - looking as if she saw the walls of the room closing in . It was enough to make a man get up and leave the table . The light from the rose - shaded lamp fell on her neck and arms - Soames liked her to dine in a low dress , it gave him an inexpressible feeling of superiority to the majority of his acquaintance , whose wives were contented with their best high frocks or with tea - gowns , when they dined at home . Under that rosy light her amber - coloured hair and fair skin made strange contrast with her dark brown eyes . Could a man own anything prettier than this dining - table with its deep tints , the starry , soft - petalled roses , the ruby - coloured glass , and quaint silver furnishing ; could a man own anything prettier than the woman who sat at it ? Gratitude was no virtue among Forsytes , who , competitive , and full of common - sense , had no occasion for it ; and Soames only experienced a sense of exasperation amounting to pain , that he did not own her as it was his right to own her , that he could not , as by stretching out his hand to that rose , pluck her and sniff the very secrets of her heart . Out of his other property , out of all the things he had collected , his silver , his pictures , his houses , his investments , he got a secret and intimate feeling ; out of her he got none . In this house of his there was writing on every wall . His business - like temperament protested against a mysterious warning that she was not made for him . He had married this woman , conquered her , made her his own , and it seemed to him contrary to the most fundamental of all laws , the law of possession , that he could do no more than own her body - if indeed he could do that , which he was beginning to doubt . If any one had asked him if he wanted to own her soul , the question would have seemed to him both ridiculous and sentimental . But he did so want , and the writing said he never would . She was ever silent , passive , gracefully averse ; as though terrified lest by word , motion , or sign she might lead him to believe that she was fond of him ; and he asked himself : Must I always go on like this ? Like most novel readers of his generation and Soames was a great novel reader , literature coloured his view of life ; and he had imbibed the belief that it was only a question of time . In the end the husband always gained the affection of his wife . Even in those cases - a class of book he was not very fond of - which ended in tragedy , the wife always died with poignant regrets on her lips , or if it were the husband who died - unpleasant thought - threw herself on his body in an agony of remorse . He often took Irene to the theatre , instinctively choosing the modern Society Plays with the modern Society conjugal problem , so fortunately different from any conjugal problem in real life . He found that they too always ended in the same way , even when there was a lover in the case . While he was watching the play Soames often sympathized with the lover ; but before he reached home again , driving with Irene in a hansom , he saw that this would not do , and he was glad the play had ended as it had . There was one class of husband that had just then come into fashion , the strong , rather rough , but extremely sound man , who was peculiarly successful at the end of the play ; with this person Soames was really not in sympathy , and had it not been for his own position , would have expressed his disgust with the fellow . But he was so conscious of how vital to himself was the necessity for being a successful , even a ' strong , ' husband , that he never spoke of a distaste born perhaps by the perverse processes of Nature out of a secret fund of brutality in himself . But Irene 's silence this evening was exceptional . He had never before seen such an expression on her face . And since it is always the unusual which alarms , Soames was alarmed . He ate his savoury , and hurried the maid as she swept off the crumbs with the silver sweeper . When she had left the room , he filled his glass with wine and said : "
27322	27323	27324	27324	June	166	" "
27326	27327	27324	27324	June	166	" "
27333	27352	27330	27330	she	963	" It was an axiom with the Forsytes that people did not go anywhere unless they wanted something . "
27363	27369	27360	27360	I	0	" Irene made no reply . "
27375	27379	27382	27382	she	963	" continued Soames , "
27400	27409	27393	27393	She	963	" Irene 's eyes made him feel uncomfortable . "
27420	27424	27393	27393	She	963	" she exclaimed . "
27433	27434	27428	27428	Anybody	2303	" "
27451	27458	27459	27459	You	0	" Soames 's composure gave way . "
27465	27485	27486	27486	You	0	" he said . But secretly he wondered at the heat of her reply ; it was unlike her . "
27545	27582	27525	27525	you	0	" He had been glad to get his news out under cover of this burst of irritation . He had expected a cry of dismay ; the silence with which his pronouncement was received alarmed him . "
27589	27596	27583	27583	You	0	" he was obliged to add . "
27602	27609	27597	27597	I	0	" He looked at her sharply . "
27614	27615	27616	27616	June	166	" "
27618	27619	27616	27616	June	166	" "
27625	27638	27622	27622	she	166	" Irene did not answer . Baffled and uncomfortable , he said : "
27665	27666	27657	27657	she	166	" "
27669	27680	27657	27657	she	166	" There was another pause , and then Soames said : "
27691	27697	27657	27657	she	166	" Irene made no reply . "
27714	27715	27708	27708	You	0	" "
27725	27775	27708	27708	You	0	" She took the vase of roses and left the room . Soames remained seated . Was it for this that he had signed that contract ? Was it for this that he was going to spend some ten thousand pounds ? Bosinney 's phrase came back to him : "
27781	27956	27776	27776	Women	817	" But presently he grew calmer . It might have , been worse . She might have flared up . He had expected something more than this . It was lucky , after all , that June had broken the ice for him . She must have wormed it out of Bosinney ; he might have known she would . He lighted his cigarette . After all , Irene had not made a scene ! She would come round - that was the best of her ; she was cold , but not sulky . And , puffing the cigarette smoke at a lady - bird on the shining table , he plunged into a reverie about the house . It was no good worrying ; he would go and make it up presently . She would be sitting out there in the dark , under the Japanese sunshade , knitting . A beautiful , warm night .... In truth , June had come in that afternoon with shining eyes , and the words : "
27974	27987	27988	27988	Your	168	" Irene 's face remaining dark and puzzled , she went on : "
28005	28011	28002	28002	you	168	" Irene did not know . "
28026	28036	28037	28037	You	168	" Looking impatiently at her friend , she cried : "
28081	28165	28073	28073	you	168	" and thereupon she poured out the whole story . Since her own engagement she had not seemed much interested in her friend 's position ; the hours she spent with Irene were given to confidences of her own ; and at times , for all her affectionate pity , it was impossible to keep out of her smile a trace of compassionate contempt for the woman who had made such a mistake in her life - such a vast , ridiculous mistake . "
28184	28210	28212	28212	you	168	" June broke into laughter , her little figure quivered gleefully ; she raised her hand , and struck a blow at a muslin curtain . "
28221	28523	28218	28219	Uncle James	241	" But , with a sudden dislike to mentioning that incident , she stopped ; and presently , finding her friend so unresponsive , went away . She looked back from the pavement , and Irene was still standing in the doorway . In response to her farewell wave , Irene put her hand to her brow , and , turning slowly , shut the door .... Soames went to the drawing - room presently , and peered at her through the window . Out in the shadow of the Japanese sunshade she was sitting very still , the lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise and fall of her bosom . But about this silent creature sitting there so motionless , in the dark , there seemed a warmth , a hidden fervour of feeling , as if the whole of her being had been stirred , and some change were taking place in its very depths . He stole back to the dining - room unnoticed . CHAPTER VI - JAMES AT LARGE It was not long before Soames 's determination to build went the round of the family , and created the flutter that any decision connected with property should make among Forsytes . It was not his fault , for he had been determined that no one should know . June , in the fulness of her heart , had told Mrs. Small , giving her leave only to tell Aunt Ann - she thought it would cheer her , the poor old sweet ! for Aunt Ann had kept her room now for many days . Mrs. Small told Aunt Ann at once , who , smiling as she lay back on her pillows , said in her distinct , trembling old voice : "
28545	28628	28629	28629	Smither	259	" When she was left alone again , a frown , like a cloud presaging a rainy morrow , crossed her face . While she was lying there so many days the process of recharging her will went on all the time ; it spread to her face , too , and tightening movements were always in action at the corners of her lips . The maid Smither , who had been in her service since girlhood , and was spoken of as "
28639	28811	28629	28629	Smither	259	" - the maid Smither performed every morning with extreme punctiliousness the crowning ceremony of that ancient toilet . Taking from the recesses of their pure white band - box those flat , grey curls , the insignia of personal dignity , she placed them securely in her mistress 's hands , and turned her back . And every day Aunts Juley and Hester were required to come and report on Timothy ; what news there was of Nicholas ; whether dear June had succeeded in getting Jolyon to shorten the engagement , now that Mr. Bosinney was building Soames a house ; whether young Roger 's wife was really - expecting ; how the operation on Archie had succeeded ; and what Swithin had done about that empty house in Wigmore Street , where the tenant had lost all his money and treated him so badly ; above all , about Soames ; was Irene still - still asking for a separate room ? And every morning Smither was told : "
28839	28913	28914	28914	Nobody	2292	" After telling Aunt Ann , Mrs. Small had spoken of the house in the strictest confidence to Mrs. Nicholas , who in her turn had asked Winifred Dartie for confirmation , supposing , of course , that , being Soames 's sister , she would know all about it . Through her it had in due course come round to the ears of James . He had been a good deal agitated . "
28916	28920	28922	28922	him	976	" he said , "
28925	29060	28914	28914	Nobody	2292	" And , rather than go direct to Soames himself , of whose taciturnity he was afraid , he took his umbrella and went round to Timothy 's . He found Mrs. Septimus and Hester who had been told - she was so safe , she found it tiring to talk ready , and indeed eager , to discuss the news . It was very good of dear Soames , they thought , to employ Mr. Bosinney , but rather risky . What had George named him ? ' The Buccaneer ' How droll ! But George was always droll ! However , it would be all in the family they supposed they must really look upon Mr. Bosinney as belonging to the family , though it seemed strange . James here broke in : "
29099	29100	29101	29101	Soames	177	" "
29103	29108	29101	29101	Soames	177	" interposed Aunt Juley , "
29146	29155	29144	29144	I	0	" James put his hand behind his ear : "
29158	29162	29144	29144	I	0	" he said . "
29205	29674	29675	29675	Your	982	" And , having got what he wanted , he took his hat and went away . It was a fine afternoon , and he walked across the Park towards Soames 's , where he intended to dine , for Emily 's toe kept her in bed , and Rachel and Cicely were on a visit to the country . He took the slanting path from the Bayswater side of the Row to the Knightsbridge Gate , across a pasture of short , burnt grass , dotted with blackened sheep , strewn with seated couples and strange waifs ; lying prone on their faces , like corpses on a field over which the wave of battle has rolled . He walked rapidly , his head bent , looking neither to right nor , left . The appearance of this park , the centre of his own battle - field , where he had all his life been fighting , excited no thought or speculation in his mind . These corpses flung down , there , from out the press and turmoil of the struggle , these pairs of lovers sitting cheek by jowl for an hour of idle Elysium snatched from the monotony of their treadmill , awakened no fancies in his mind ; he had outlived that kind of imagination ; his nose , like the nose of a sheep , was fastened to the pastures on which he browsed . One of his tenants had lately shown a disposition to be behind - hand in his rent , and it had become a grave question whether he had not better turn him out at once , and so run the risk of not re - letting before Christmas . Swithin had just been let in very badly , but it had served him right - he had held on too long . He pondered this as he walked steadily , holding his umbrella carefully by the wood , just below the crook of the handle , so as to keep the ferule off the ground , and not fray the silk in the middle . And , with his thin , high shoulders stooped , his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision , this passage through the Park , where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much idleness - on so many human evidences of the remorseless battle of Property , raging beyond its ring - was like the flight of some land bird across the sea . He felt a - touch on the arm as he came out at Albert Gate . It was Soames , who , crossing from the shady side of Piccadilly , where he had been walking home from the office , had suddenly appeared alongside . "
29681	29685	29686	29686	I	0	" said James ; "
29704	30078	30079	30084	the family " significant and dear	2923	" The outward relations between James and his son were marked by a lack of sentiment peculiarly Forsytean , but for all that the two were by no means unattached . Perhaps they regarded one another as an investment ; certainly they were solicitous of each other 's welfare , glad of each other 's company . They had never exchanged two words upon the more intimate problems of life , or revealed in each other 's presence the existence of any deep feeling . Something beyond the power of word - analysis bound them together , something hidden deep in the fibre of nations and families - for blood , they say , is thicker than water - and neither of them was a cold - blooded man . Indeed , in James love of his children was now the prime motive of his existence . To have creatures who were parts of himself , to whom he might transmit the money he saved , was at the root of his saving ; and , at seventy - five , what was left that could give him pleasure , but - saving ? The kernel of life was in this saving for his children . Than James Forsyte , notwithstanding all his ' Jonah - isms , ' there was no saner man if the leading symptom of sanity , as we are told , is self - preservation , though without doubt Timothy went too far in all this London , of which he owned so much , and loved with such a dumb love , as the centre of his opportunities . He had the marvellous instinctive sanity of the middle class . In him - more than in Jolyon , with his masterful will and his moments of tenderness and philosophy - more than in Swithin , the martyr to crankiness - Nicholas , the sufferer from ability - and Roger , the victim of enterprise - beat the true pulse of compromise ; of all the brothers he was least remarkable in mind and person , and for that reason more likely to live for ever . To James , more than to any of the others , was "
30081	30547	30550	30550	they	984	" significant and dear . There had always been something primitive and cosy in his attitude towards life ; he loved the family hearth , he loved gossip , and he loved grumbling . All his decisions were formed of a cream which he skimmed off the family mind ; and , through that family , off the minds of thousands of other families of similar fibre . Year after year , week after week , he went to Timothy 's , and in his brother 's front drawing - room - his legs twisted , his long white whiskers framing his clean - shaven mouth - would sit watching the family pot simmer , the cream rising to the top ; and he would go away sheltered , refreshed , comforted , with an indefinable sense of comfort . Beneath the adamant of his self - preserving instinct there was much real softness in James ; a visit to Timothy 's was like an hour spent in the lap of a mother ; and the deep craving he himself had for the protection of the family wing reacted in turn on his feelings towards his own children ; it was a nightmare to him to think of them exposed to the treatment of the world , in money , health , or reputation . When his old friend John Street 's son volunteered for special service , he shook his head querulously , and wondered what John Street was about to allow it ; and when young Street was assagaied , he took it so much to heart that he made a point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying : He knew how it would be - he 'd no patience with them ! When his son - in - law Dartie had that financial crisis , due to speculation in Oil Shares , James made himself ill worrying over it ; the knell of all prosperity seemed to have sounded . It took him three months and a visit to Baden - Baden to get better ; there was something terrible in the idea that but for his , James 's , money , Dartie 's name might have appeared in the Bankruptcy List . Composed of a physiological mixture so sound that if he had an earache he thought he was dying , he regarded the occasional ailments of his wife and children as in the nature of personal grievances , special interventions of Providence for the purpose of destroying his peace of mind ; but he did not believe at all in the ailments of people outside his own immediate family , affirming them in every case to be due to neglected liver . His universal comment was : "
30564	30776	30779	30779	you	985	" When he went to Soames 's that evening he felt that life was hard on him : There was Emily with a bad toe , and Rachel gadding about in the country ; he got no sympathy from anybody ; and Ann , she was ill - he did not believe she would last through the summer ; he had called there three times now without her being able to see him ! And this idea of Soames 's , building a house , that would have to be looked into . As to the trouble with Irene , he did n't know what was to come of that - anything might come of it ! He entered 62 , Montpellier Square with the fullest intentions of being miserable . It was already half - past seven , and Irene , dressed for dinner , was seated in the drawing - room . She was wearing her gold - coloured frock - for , having been displayed at a dinner - party , a soiree , and a dance , it was now to be worn at home - and she had adorned the bosom with a cascade of lace , on which James 's eyes riveted themselves at once . "
30784	30792	30779	30779	you	985	" he said in an aggravated voice . "
30816	31094	31095	31095	You	986	" Irene came close , to prove to him that he was in error . And , in spite of himself , James felt the influence of her deference , of the faint seductive perfume exhaling from her . No self - respecting Forsyte surrendered at a blow ; so he merely said : He did n't know - he expected she was spending a pretty penny on dress . The gong sounded , and , putting her white arm within his , Irene took him into the dining - room . She seated him in Soames 's usual place , round the corner on her left . The light fell softly there , so that he would not be worried by the gradual dying of the day ; and she began to talk to him about himself . Presently , over James came a change , like the mellowing that steals upon a fruit in the sun ; a sense of being caressed , and praised , and petted , and all without the bestowal of a single caress or word of praise . He felt that what he was eating was agreeing with him ; he could not get that feeling at home ; he did not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne so much , and , on inquiring the brand and price , was surprised to find that it was one of which he had a large stock himself , but could never drink ; he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know that he had been swindled . Looking up from his food , he remarked : "
31127	31151	31152	31152	I	0	" He was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture , on the wall opposite , which he himself had given them : "
31161	31181	31152	31152	I	0	" he said . They rose to go into the drawing - room , and James followed Irene closely . "
31192	31203	31185	31185	I	0	" he murmured , breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder ; "
31241	31524	31231	31231	she	989	" He had as yet made no allusion to the building of the house , nor did he when Soames , pleading the excuse of business , betook himself to the room at the top , where he kept his pictures . James was left alone with his daughter - in - law . The glow of the wine , and of an excellent liqueur , was still within him . He felt quite warm towards her . She was really a taking little thing ; she listened to you , and seemed to understand what you were saying ; and , while talking , he kept examining her figure , from her bronze - coloured shoes to the waved gold of her hair . She was leaning back in an Empire chair , her shoulders poised against the top - her body , flexibly straight and unsupported from the hips , swaying when she moved , as though giving to the arms of a lover . Her lips were smiling , her eyes half - closed . It may have been a recognition of danger in the very charm of her attitude , or a twang of digestion , that caused a sudden dumbness to fall on James . He did not remember ever having been quite alone with Irene before . And , as he looked at her , an odd feeling crept over him , as though he had come across something strange and foreign . Now what was she thinking about - sitting back like that ? Thus when he spoke it was in a sharper voice , as if he had been awakened from a pleasant dream . "
31533	31537	31231	31231	she	989	" he said . "
31546	31583	31538	31538	You	990	" She seemed to be making very lame excuses , and James did not look at her . He did not want to believe that she was really avoiding them - it would mean too much . "
31595	31599	31600	31600	You	990	" he said ; "
31715	31730	31704	31704	I	0	" The colour deepened in Irene 's face ; and James watched her suspiciously . "
31740	31744	31732	31732	you	990	" she said . "
31750	31755	31748	31748	him	168	" James hummed out : "
31793	31806	31784	31784	You	990	" he added ; and again his suspicious glance rested on her . "
31815	31827	31807	31807	He	168	" she said softly , evidently trying to smooth things over . "
31839	31843	31833	31833	I	0	" continued James ; "
31870	31871	31864	31868	a first - rate man	1000	" "
31880	31892	31873	31874	Mr. Bosinney	168	" James rose , and took a turn with bent head . "
31898	31902	31864	31868	a first - rate man	1000	" he said , "
31919	31950	31864	31868	a first - rate man	1000	" Halting his tall , lank figure before her , he raised a finger , and levelled it at her bosom , as though bringing an indictment against her beauty : "
31994	32067	32068	32068	I	0	" Irene smiled ; and in the curve of her lips was a strange provocation . She seemed to have lost her deference . Her breast rose and fell as though with secret anger ; she drew her hands inwards from their rest on the arms of her chair until the tips of her fingers met , and her dark eyes looked unfathomably at James . The latter gloomily scrutinized the floor . "
32074	32078	32071	32071	my	0	" he said , "
32097	32162	32163	32163	You	1001	" A brooding look came instantly on Irene 's face , and even James became conscious of the rigidity that took possession of her whole figure beneath the softness of its silk and lace clothing . He was frightened by the effect he had produced , and like most men with but little courage , he sought at once to justify himself by bullying . "
32213	32226	32209	32211	a young woman	1008	" The brooding look darkened on her face ; he grew nervous . "
32235	32239	32240	32240	nobody	2292	" he said ; "
32275	32322	32264	32264	he	1010	" Biting the corner of his forefinger he stole a cold , sharp look at his daughter - in - law . He encountered her eyes fixed on his own , so dark and deep , that he stopped , and broke into a gentle perspiration . "
32330	32612	32325	32325	I	0	" he said after a short pause , and a minute later rose , with a slight appearance of surprise , as though he had expected to be asked to stop . Giving his hand to Irene , he allowed himself to be conducted to the door , and let out into the street . He would not have a cab , he would walk , Irene was to say good - night to Soames for him , and if she wanted a little gaiety , well , he would drive her down to Richmond any day . He walked home , and going upstairs , woke Emily out of the first sleep she had had for four and twenty hours , to tell her that it was his impression things were in a bad way at Soames 's ; on this theme he descanted for half an hour , until at last , saying that he would not sleep a wink , he turned on his side and instantly began to snore . In Montpellier Square Soames , who had come from the picture room , stood invisible at the top of the stairs , watching Irene sort the letters brought by the last post . She turned back into the drawing - room ; but in a minute came out , and stood as if listening . Then she came stealing up the stairs , with a kitten in her arms . He could see her face bent over the little beast , which was purring against her neck . Why could n't she look at him like that ? Suddenly she saw him , and her face changed . "
32618	32622	32325	32325	I	0	" he said . "
32625	33095	32325	32325	I	0	" He stood aside , and without another word she passed on into the bedroom . CHAPTER VII - OLD JOLYON 'S PECCADILLO Old Jolyon came out of Lord 's cricket ground that same afternoon with the intention of going home . He had not reached Hamilton Terrace before he changed his mind , and hailing a cab , gave the driver an address in Wistaria Avenue . He had taken a resolution . June had hardly been at home at all that week ; she had given him nothing of her company for a long time past , not , in fact , since she had become engaged to Bosinney . He never asked her for her company . It was not his habit to ask people for things ! She had just that one idea now - Bosinney and his affairs - and she left him stranded in his great house , with a parcel of servants , and not a soul to speak to from morning to night . His Club was closed for cleaning ; his Boards in recess ; there was nothing , therefore , to take him into the City . June had wanted him to go away ; she would not go herself , because Bosinney was in London . But where was he to go by himself ? He could not go abroad alone ; the sea upset his liver ; he hated hotels . Roger went to a hydropathic - he was not going to begin that at his time of life , those new - fangled places we 're all humbug ! With such formulas he clothed to himself the desolation of his spirit ; the lines down his face deepening , his eyes day by day looking forth with the melancholy which sat so strangely on a face wo nt to be strong and serene . And so that afternoon he took this journey through St. John 's Wood , in the golden - light that sprinkled the rounded green bushes of the acacia 's before the little houses , in the summer sunshine that seemed holding a revel over the little gardens ; and he looked about him with interest ; for this was a district which no Forsyte entered without open disapproval and secret curiosity . His cab stopped in front of a small house of that peculiar buff colour which implies a long immunity from paint . It had an outer gate , and a rustic approach . He stepped out , his bearing extremely composed ; his massive head , with its drooping moustache and wings of white hair , very upright , under an excessively large top hat ; his glance firm , a little angry . He had been driven into this ! "
33102	33103	33107	33107	sir	730	" "
33122	33185	33113	33113	I	0	" Old Jolyon could not help twinkling at the little maid as he gave his name . She seemed to him such a funny little toad ! And he followed her through the dark hall , into a small double , drawing - room , where the furniture was covered in chintz , and the little maid placed him in a chair . "
33208	34530	33203	33203	I	0	" Old Jolyon sat down in the chintz - covered chair , and looked around him . The whole place seemed to him , as he would have expressed it , pokey ; there was a certain - he could not tell exactly what - air of shabbiness , or rather of making two ends meet , about everything . As far as he could see , not a single piece of furniture was worth a five - pound note . The walls , distempered rather a long time ago , were decorated with water - colour sketches ; across the ceiling meandered a long crack . These little houses were all old , second - rate concerns ; he should hope the rent was under a hundred a year ; it hurt him more than he could have said , to think of a Forsyte - his own son living in such a place . The little maid came back . Would he please to go down into the garden ? Old Jolyon marched out through the French windows . In descending the steps he noticed that they wanted painting . Young Jolyon , his wife , his two children , and his dog Balthasar , were all out there under a pear - tree . This walk towards them was the most courageous act of old Jolyon 's life ; but no muscle of his face moved , no nervous gesture betrayed him . He kept his deep - set eyes steadily on the enemy . In those two minutes he demonstrated to perfection all that unconscious soundness , balance , and vitality of fibre that made , of him and so many others of his class the core of the nation . In the unostentatious conduct of their own affairs , to the neglect of everything else , they typified the essential individualism , born in the Briton from the natural isolation of his country 's life . The dog Balthasar sniffed round the edges of his trousers ; this friendly and cynical mongrel - offspring of a liaison between a Russian poodle and a fox - terrier - had a nose for the unusual . The strange greetings over , old Jolyon seated himself in a wicker chair , and his two grandchildren , one on each side of his knees , looked at him silently , never having seen so old a man . They were unlike , as though recognising the difference set between them by the circumstances of their births . Jolly , the child of sin , pudgy - faced , with his tow - coloured hair brushed off his forehead , and a dimple in his chin , had an air of stubborn amiability , and the eyes of a Forsyte ; little Holly , the child of wedlock , was a dark - skinned , solemn soul , with her mother 's , grey and wistful eyes . The dog Balthasar , having walked round the three small flower - beds , to show his extreme contempt for things at large , had also taken a seat in front of old Jolyon , and , oscillating a tail curled by Nature tightly over his back , was staring up with eyes that did not blink . Even in the garden , that sense of things being pokey haunted old Jolyon ; the wicker chair creaked under his weight ; the garden - beds looked ' daverdy ' ; on the far side , under the smut - stained wall , cats had made a path . While he and his grandchildren thus regarded each other with the peculiar scrutiny , curious yet trustful , that passes between the very young and the very old , young Jolyon watched his wife . The colour had deepened in her thin , oval face , with its straight brows , and large , grey eyes . Her hair , brushed in fine , high curves back from her forehead , was going grey , like his own , and this greyness made the sudden vivid colour in her cheeks painfully pathetic . The look on her face , such as he had never seen there before , such as she had always hidden from him , was full of secret resentments , and longings , and fears . Her eyes , under their twitching brows , stared painfully . And she was silent . Jolly alone sustained the conversation ; he had many possessions , and was anxious that his unknown friend with extremely large moustaches , and hands all covered with blue veins , who sat with legs crossed like his own father a habit he was himself trying to acquire , should know it ; but being a Forsyte , though not yet quite eight years old , he made no mention of the thing at the moment dearest to his heart - a camp of soldiers in a shop - window , which his father had promised to buy . No doubt it seemed to him too precious ; a tempting of Providence to mention it yet . And the sunlight played through the leaves on that little party of the three generations grouped tranquilly under the pear - tree , which had long borne no fruit . Old Jolyon 's furrowed face was reddening patchily , as old men 's faces redden in the sun . He took one of Jolly 's hands in his own ; the boy climbed on to his knee ; and little Holly , mesmerized by this sight , crept up to them ; the sound of the dog Balthasar 's scratching arose rhythmically . Suddenly young Mrs. Jolyon got up and hurried indoors . A minute later her husband muttered an excuse , and followed . Old Jolyon was left alone with his grandchildren . And Nature with her quaint irony began working in him one of her strange revolutions , following her cyclic laws into the depths of his heart . And that tenderness for little children , that passion for the beginnings of life which had once made him forsake his son and follow June , now worked in him to forsake June and follow these littler things . Youth , like a flame , burned ever in his breast , and to youth he turned , to the round little limbs , so reckless , that wanted care , to the small round faces so unreasonably solemn or bright , to the treble tongues , and the shrill , chuckling laughter , to the insistent tugging hands , and the feel of small bodies against his legs , to all that was young and young , and once more young . And his eyes grew soft , his voice , and thin - veined hands soft , and soft his heart within him . And to those small creatures he became at once a place of pleasure , a place where they were secure , and could talk and laugh and play ; till , like sunshine , there radiated from old Jolyon 's wicker chair the perfect gaiety of three hearts . But with young Jolyon following to his wife 's room it was different . He found her seated on a chair before her dressing - glass , with her hands before her face . Her shoulders were shaking with sobs . This passion of hers for suffering was mysterious to him . He had been through a hundred of these moods ; how he had survived them he never knew , for he could never believe they were moods , and that the last hour of his partnership had not struck . In the night she would be sure to throw her arms round his neck and say : "
34541	34792	34533	34533	Jo	190	" as she had done a hundred times before . He reached out his hand , and , unseen , slipped his razor - case into his pocket . ' I can not stay here , ' he thought , ' I must go down ! ' Without a word he left the room , and went back to the lawn . Old Jolyon had little Holly on his knee ; she had taken possession of his watch ; Jolly , very red in the face , was trying to show that he could stand on his head . The dog Balthasar , as close as he might be to the tea - table , had fixed his eyes on the cake . Young Jolyon felt a malicious desire to cut their enjoyment short . What business had his father to come and upset his wife like this ? It was a shock , after all these years ! He ought to have known ; he ought to have given them warning ; but when did a Forsyte ever imagine that his conduct could upset anybody ! And in his thoughts he did old Jolyon wrong . He spoke sharply to the children , and told them to go in to their tea . Greatly surprised , for they had never heard their father speak sharply before , they went off , hand in hand , little Holly looking back over her shoulder . Young Jolyon poured out the tea . "
34801	34834	34533	34533	Jo	190	" he said , but he knew well enough that his father had penetrated the cause of that sudden withdrawal , and almost hated the old man for sitting there so calmly . "
34844	34853	34835	34835	You	0	" said old Jolyon with a shrewd look ; "
34864	34869	34856	34856	you	0	" Young Jolyon nodded . "
34877	34882	34897	34899	a ramshackle lot	1021	" said old Jolyon ; "
34887	34892	34897	34899	a ramshackle lot	1021	" Young Jolyon replied : "
34901	34924	34897	34899	a ramshackle lot	1021	" ' The silence was now only broken by the sound of the dog Balthasar 's scratching . Old Jolyon said simply : "
34943	36072	34938	34938	I	0	" At these words young Jolyon got up and put his hand on his father 's shoulder . In the next house someone was playing over and over again : ' La Donna mobile ' on an untuned piano ; and the little garden had fallen into shade , the sun now only reached the wall at the end , whereon basked a crouching cat , her yellow eyes turned sleepily down on the dog Balthasar . There was a drowsy hum of very distant traffic ; the creepered trellis round the garden shut out everything but sky , and house , and pear - tree , with its top branches still gilded by the sun . For some time they sat there , talking but little . Then old Jolyon rose to go , and not a word was said about his coming again . He walked away very sadly . What a poor miserable place ; and he thought of the great , empty house in Stanhope Gate , fit residence for a Forsyte , with its huge billiard - room and drawing - room that no one entered from one week 's end to another . That woman , whose face he had rather liked , was too thin - skinned by half ; she gave Jo a bad time he knew ! And those sweet children ! Ah ! what a piece of awful folly ! He walked towards the Edgware Road , between rows of little houses , all suggesting to him erroneously no doubt , but the prejudices of a Forsyte are sacred shady histories of some sort or kind . Society , forsooth , the chattering hags and jackanapes - had set themselves up to pass judgment on his flesh and blood ! A parcel of old women ! He stumped his umbrella on the ground , as though to drive it into the heart of that unfortunate body , which had dared to ostracize his son and his son 's son , in whom he could have lived again ! He stumped his umbrella fiercely ; yet he himself had followed Society 's behaviour for fifteen years - had only today been false to it ! He thought of June , and her dead mother , and the whole story , with all his old bitterness . A wretched business ! He was a long time reaching Stanhope Gate , for , with native perversity , being extremely tired , he walked the whole way . After washing his hands in the lavatory downstairs , he went to the dining - room to wait for dinner , the only room he used when June was out - it was less lonely so . The evening paper had not yet come ; he had finished the Times , there was therefore nothing to do . The room faced the backwater of traffic , and was very silent . He disliked dogs , but a dog even would have been company . His gaze , travelling round the walls , rested on a picture entitled : ' Group of Dutch fishing boats at sunset ' ; the chef d'oeuvre of his collection . It gave him no pleasure . He closed his eyes . He was lonely ! He ought n't to complain , he knew , but he could n't help it : He was a poor thing - had always been a poor thing - no pluck ! Such was his thought . The butler came to lay the table for dinner , and seeing his master apparently asleep , exercised extreme caution in his movements . This bearded man also wore a moustache , which had given rise to grave doubts in the minds of many members - of the family - , especially those who , like Soames , had been to public schools , and were accustomed to niceness in such matters . Could he really be considered a butler ? Playful spirits alluded to him as : ' Uncle Jolyon 's Nonconformist ' ; George , the acknowledged wag , had named him : ' Sankey . ' He moved to and fro between the great polished sideboard and the great polished table inimitably sleek and soft . Old Jolyon watched him , feigning sleep . The fellow was a sneak - he had always thought so - who cared about nothing but rattling through his work , and getting out to his betting or his woman or goodness knew what ! A slug ! Fat too ! And did n't care a pin about his master ! But then against his will , came one of those moments of philosophy which made old Jolyon different from other Forsytes : After all why should the man care ? He was n't paid to care , and why expect it ? In this world people could n't look for affection unless they paid for it . It might be different in the next - he did n't know - could n't tell ! And again he shut his eyes . Relentless and stealthy , the butler pursued his labours , taking things from the various compartments of the sideboard . His back seemed always turned to old Jolyon ; thus , he robbed his operations of the unseemliness of being carried on in his master 's presence ; now and then he furtively breathed on the silver , and wiped it with a piece of chamois leather . He appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters , which he carried carefully and rather high , letting his heard droop over them protectingly . When he had finished , he stood for over a minute watching his master , and in his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt : After all , this master of his was an old buffer , who had n't much left in him ! Soft as a tom - cat , he crossed the room to press the bell . His orders were ' dinner at seven . ' What if his master were asleep ; he would soon have him out of that ; there was the night to sleep in ! He had himself to think of , for he was due at his Club at half - past eight ! In answer to the ring , appeared a page boy with a silver soup tureen . The butler took it from his hands and placed it on the table , then , standing by the open door , as though about to usher company into the room , he said in a solemn voice : "
36081	36548	36549	36551	An odd fellow	1023	" Slowly old Jolyon got up out of his chair , and sat down at the table to eat his dinner . CHAPTER VIII - PLANS OF THE HOUSE Forsytes , as is generally admitted , have shells , like that extremely useful little animal which is made into Turkish delight , in other words , they are never seen , or if seen would not be recognised , without habitats , composed of circumstance , property , acquaintances , and wives , which seem to move along with them in their passage through a world composed of thousands of other Forsytes with their habitats . Without a habitat a Forsyte is inconceivable - he would be like a novel without a plot , which is well - known to be an anomaly . To Forsyte eyes Bosinney appeared to have no habitat , he seemed one of those rare and unfortunate men who go through life surrounded by circumstance , property , acquaintances , and wives that do not belong to them . His rooms in Sloane Street , on the top floor , outside which , on a plate , was his name , ' Philip Baynes Bosinney , Architect , ' were not those of a Forsyte . - He had no sitting - room apart from his office , but a large recess had been screened off to conceal the necessaries of life - a couch , an easy chair , his pipes , spirit case , novels and slippers . The business part of the room had the usual furniture ; an open cupboard with pigeon - holes , a round oak table , a folding wash - stand , some hard chairs , a standing desk of large dimensions covered with drawings and designs . June had twice been to tea there under the chaperonage of his aunt . He was believed to have a bedroom at the back . As far as the family had been able to ascertain his income , it consisted of two consulting appointments at twenty pounds a year , together with an odd fee once in a way , and - more worthy item - a private annuity under his father 's will of one hundred and fifty pounds a year . What had transpired concerning that father was not so reassuring . It appeared that he had been a Lincolnshire country doctor of Cornish extraction , striking appearance , and Byronic tendencies - a well - known figure , in fact , in his county . Bosinney 's uncle by marriage , Baynes , of Baynes and Bildeboy , a Forsyte in instincts if not in name , had but little that was worthy to relate of his brother - in - law . "
36699	36713	36714	36714	He	274	" Of Bosinney himself Baynes would speak warmly , with a certain compassion : "
36848	36870	36841	36842	Old Forsyte	275	" Mr. Baynes made himself extremely pleasant to June , who frequently visited his house in Lowndes Square at this period . "
36892	36899	36900	36900	you	1038	" he would say to her ; "
36977	37051	36972	36972	I	0	" June had complained that her lover found no time to come to Stanhope Gate . The first time he came again they had not been together a quarter of an hour before , by one of those coincidences of which she was a mistress , Mrs. Septimus Small arrived . Thereon Bosinney rose and hid himself , according to previous arrangement , in the little study , to wait for her departure . "
37055	37060	36972	36972	I	0	" said Aunt Juley , "
37102	37139	37094	37095	your Uncle	994	" June , her little figure erect before the hearth , her small face quivering grimly , for she regarded her aunt 's untimely visit in the light of a personal injury , replied with scorn : "
37158	37188	37189	37189	I	0	" Aunt Juley pouted ; she herself had always been thin , but the only pleasure she derived from the fact was the opportunity of longing to be stouter . "
37194	37199	37189	37189	I	0	" she said mournfully , "
37252	37253	37246	37246	Soames	177	" "
37256	37265	37291	37291	Swithin	233	" cried June , flaring up at once ; "
37281	37288	37291	37291	Swithin	233	" Mrs. Small was taken aback . "
37293	37297	37291	37291	Swithin	233	" she said , "
37323	37324	37317	37317	you	2282	" "
37327	37331	37317	37317	you	2282	" said June , "
37340	37349	37317	37317	you	2282	" Aunt Juley tried to say something pleasant : "
37361	37413	37416	37416	she	186	" June gazed at her intently , with a look in her eyes as if her conscience had suddenly leaped up into them ; it passed ; and an even more intent look took its place , as if she had stared that conscience out of countenance . She replied imperiously : "
37426	37432	37433	37433	I	0	" Mrs. Small grew nervous . "
37438	37442	37433	37433	I	0	" she said ; "
37491	37500	37501	37501	I	0	" June clasped her hands behind her neck . "
37505	37509	37501	37501	I	0	" she cried , "
37522	37535	37536	37536	He	170	" Aunt Juley rose to the full height of her tall figure . "
37546	37564	37536	37536	He	170	" she said . June was instantly compunctious ; she ran to her aunt and kissed her . "
37581	37624	37575	37575	they	1061	" Aunt Juley , unable to think of anything further on the subject that would be suitable , was silent ; she prepared for departure , hooking her black silk cape across her chest , and , taking up her green reticule : "
37632	37639	37640	37640	I	0	" she asked in the hall , "
37658	37716	37655	37656	Mr. Bosinney	168	" She bent and kissed her niece hungrily , and with little , mincing steps passed away . The tears sprang up in June 's eyes ; running into the little study , where Bosinney was sitting at the table drawing birds on the back of an envelope , she sank down by his side and cried : "
37727	37785	37786	37786	Bosinney	168	" Her heart was as warm as the colour of her hair . On the following Sunday morning , while Soames was shaving , a message was brought him to the effect that Mr. Bosinney was below , and would be glad to see him . Opening the door into his wife 's room , he said : "
37817	37909	37814	37814	I	0	" Irene looked at him , without reply , put the finishing touch to her dress and went downstairs . He could not make her out about this house . She had said nothing against it , and , as far as Bosinney was concerned , seemed friendly enough . From the window of his dressing - room he could see them talking together in the little court below . He hurried on with his shaving , cutting his chin twice . He heard them laugh , and thought to himself : "
37920	37987	37912	37912	they	1065	" As he expected , Bosinney had come round to fetch him to look at the plans . He took his hat and went over . The plans were spread on the oak table in the architect 's room ; and pale , imperturbable , inquiring , Soames bent over them for a long time without speaking . He said at last in a puzzled voice : "
37996	38056	37912	37912	they	1065	" A rectangular house of two stories was designed in a quadrangle round a covered - in court . This court , encircled by a gallery on the upper floor , was roofed with a glass roof , supported by eight columns running up from the ground . It was indeed , to Forsyte eyes , an odd house . "
38067	38088	37912	37912	they	1065	" pursued Soames . Bosinney began to walk about , and Soames did not like the expression on his face . "
38095	38100	37912	37912	they	1065	" said the architect , "
38114	38137	38111	38112	a gentleman	1029	" Soames extended his finger and thumb , as if measuring the extent of the distinction he should acquire ; and replied : "
38145	38160	38111	38112	a gentleman	1029	" The peculiar look came into Bosinney 's face which marked all his enthusiasms . "
38220	38236	38237	38237	You	1067	" He put his finger suddenly down on the left division of the centre oblong : "
38342	38343	38328	38328	you	1067	" "
38347	38372	38328	38328	you	1067	" he went on - and though looking at Soames he did not seem to see him , which gave Soames an unpleasant feeling - "
38467	38512	38419	38419	we	1078	" Soames , the unconscious ironist , fixed his gaze on Bosinney 's tie , which was far from being in the perpendicular ; he was unshaven too , and his dress not remarkable for order . Architecture appeared to have exhausted his regularity . "
38521	38534	38419	38419	we	1078	" he inquired . He did not at once receive a reply . "
38542	38546	38419	38419	we	1078	" said Bosinney , "
38607	38737	38602	38602	him	280	" Soames was alarmed . He had really been struck by the plans , and the concealment of his satisfaction had been merely instinctive . It was difficult for him to pay a compliment . He despised people who were lavish with their praises . He found himself now in the embarrassing position of one who must pay a compliment or run the risk of losing a good thing . Bosinney was just the fellow who might tear up the plans and refuse to act for him ; a kind of grown - up child ! This grown - up childishness , to which he felt so superior , exercised a peculiar and almost mesmeric effect on Soames , for he had never felt anything like it in himself . "
38740	38746	38602	38602	him	280	" he stammered at last , "
38756	38810	38602	38602	him	280	" He had such a private distrust and even dislike of the word ' original ' that he felt he had not really given himself away by this remark . Bosinney seemed pleased . It was the sort of thing that would please a fellow like that ! And his success encouraged Soames . "
38818	38822	38602	38602	him	280	" he said . "
38829	38835	38602	38602	him	280	" he heard Bosinney murmur , "
38854	38920	38849	38849	he	1029	" Soames made a deprecating movement ; he had been identified with a gentleman ; not for a good deal of money now would he be classed with manufacturers . But his innate distrust of general principles revived . What the deuce was the good of talking about regularity and self - respect ? It looked to him as if the house would be cold . "
38928	38932	38921	38921	Irene	186	" he said . "
38935	38940	38921	38921	Irene	186	" said Bosinney sarcastically . "
38966	38983	38984	38984	I	0	" he pointed , to four marks at regular intervals on the walls of the court . "
39005	39013	38984	38984	I	0	" Soames looked suspiciously at these marks . "
39023	39027	38984	38984	I	0	" he said , "
39036	39048	38984	38984	I	0	" The architect took a sheet of paper from his pocket : "
39113	39114	39637	39637	you	1095	" "
39120	39124	39637	39637	you	1095	" said Soames . "
39136	39137	39127	39127	I	0	" "
39147	39152	39127	39127	I	0	" replied Bosinney coolly . "
39161	39330	39127	39127	I	0	" It was the only way , probably , that such a proposition could have been made to Soames . He was nonplussed . Conscience told him to throw the whole thing up . But the design was good , and he knew it - there was completeness about it , and dignity ; the servants ' apartments were excellent too . He would gain credit by living in a house like that - with such individual features , yet perfectly well - arranged . He continued poring over the plans , while Bosinney went into his bedroom to shave and dress . The two walked back to Montpellier Square in silence , Soames watching him out of the corner of his eye . The Buccaneer was rather a good - looking fellow - so he thought - when he was properly got up . Irene was bending over her flowers when the two men came in . She spoke of sending across the Park to fetch June . "
39335	39339	39127	39127	I	0	" said Soames , "
39349	39634	39637	39637	you	1095	" At lunch he was almost cordial , and kept pressing Bosinney to eat . He was pleased to see the architect in such high spirits , and left him to spend the afternoon with Irene , while he stole off to his pictures , after his Sunday habit . At tea - time he came down to the drawing - room , and found them talking , as he expressed it , nineteen to the dozen . Unobserved in the doorway , he congratulated himself that things were taking the right turn . It was lucky she and Bosinney got on ; she seemed to be falling into line with the idea of the new house . Quiet meditation among his pictures had decided him to spring the five hundred if necessary ; but he hoped that the afternoon might have softened Bosinney 's estimates . It was so purely a matter which Bosinney could remedy if he liked ; there must be a dozen ways in which he could cheapen the production of a house without spoiling the effect . He awaited , therefore , his opportunity till Irene was handing the architect his first cup of tea . A chink of sunshine through the lace of the blinds warmed her cheek , shone in the gold of her hair , and in her soft eyes . Possibly the same gleam deepened Bosinney 's colour , gave the rather startled look to his face . Soames hated sunshine , and he at once got up , to draw the blind . Then he took his own cup of tea from his wife , and said , more coldly than he had intended : "
39662	39680	39658	39658	you	1095	" Bosinney drank off his tea at a gulp , put down his cup , and answered : "
39684	39699	39658	39658	you	1095	" Soames saw that his suggestion had touched some unintelligible point of personal vanity . "
39702	39710	39658	39658	you	1095	" he agreed , with sulky resignation ; "
39722	39792	39715	39715	your	1095	" A few minutes later Bosinney rose to go , and Soames rose too , to see him off the premises . The architect seemed in absurdly high spirits . After watching him walk away at a swinging pace , Soames returned moodily to the drawing - room , where Irene was putting away the music , and , moved by an uncontrollable spasm of curiosity , he asked : "
39805	39825	39797	39797	you	1095	" He looked at the carpet while waiting for her answer , and he had to wait some time . "
39831	39837	39797	39797	you	1095	" she said at last . "
39847	39862	39839	39839	you	0	" Irene smiled . And it seemed to Soames that she was mocking him . "
39865	39869	39839	39839	you	0	" she answered ; "
39872	40455	39839	39839	you	0	" CHAPTER IX - DEATH OF AUNT ANN There came a morning at the end of September when Aunt Ann was unable to take from Smither 's hands the insignia of personal dignity . After one look at the old face , the doctor , hurriedly sent for , announced that Miss Forsyte had passed away in her sleep . Aunts Juley and Hester were overwhelmed by the shock . They had never imagined such an ending . Indeed , it is doubtful whether they had ever realized that an ending was bound to come . Secretly they felt it unreasonable of Ann to have left them like this without a word , without even a struggle . It was unlike her . Perhaps what really affected them so profoundly was the thought that a Forsyte should have let go her grasp on life . If one , then why not all ! It was a full hour before they could make up their minds to tell Timothy . If only it could be kept from him ! If only it could be broken to him by degrees ! And long they stood outside his door whispering together . And when it was over they whispered together again . He would feel it more , they were afraid , as time went on . Still , he had taken it better than could have been expected . He would keep his bed , of course ! They separated , crying quietly . Aunt Juley stayed in her room , prostrated by the blow . Her face , discoloured by tears , was divided into compartments by the little ridges of pouting flesh which had swollen with emotion . It was impossible to conceive of life without Ann , who had lived with her for seventy - three years , broken only by the short interregnum of her married life , which seemed now so unreal . At fixed intervals she went to her drawer , and took from beneath the lavender bags a fresh pocket - handkerchief . Her warm heart could not bear the thought that Ann was lying there so cold . Aunt Hester , the silent , the patient , that backwater of the family energy , sat in the drawing - room , where the blinds were drawn ; and she , too , had wept at first , but quietly , without visible effect . Her guiding principle , the conservation of energy , did not abandon her in sorrow . She sat , slim , motionless , studying the grate , her hands idle in the lap of her black silk dress . They would want to rouse her into doing something , no doubt . As if there were any good in that ! Doing something would not bring back Ann ! Why worry her ? Five o'clock brought three of the brothers , Jolyon and James and Swithin ; Nicholas was at Yarmouth , and Roger had a bad attack of gout . Mrs. Hayman had been by herself earlier in the day , and , after seeing Ann , had gone away , leaving a message for Timothy - which was kept from him - that she ought to have been told sooner . In fact , there was a feeling amongst them all that they ought to have been told sooner , as though they had missed something ; and James said : "
40474	41442	40463	40463	I	0	" Aunt Hester made no reply ; it was nearly October , but what was the good of arguing ; some people were never satisfied . She sent up to tell her sister that the brothers were there . Mrs. Small came down at once . She had bathed her face , which was still swollen , and though she looked severely at Swithin 's trousers , for they were of light blue - he had come straight from the club , where the news had reached him - she wore a more cheerful expression than usual , the instinct for doing the wrong thing being even now too strong for her . Presently all five went up to look at the body . Under the pure white sheet a quilted counter - pane had been placed , for now , more than ever , Aunt Ann had need of warmth ; and , the pillows removed , her spine and head rested flat , with the semblance of their life - long inflexibility ; the coif banding the top of her brow was drawn on either side to the level of the ears , and between it and the sheet her face , almost as white , was turned with closed eyes to the faces of her brothers and sisters . In its extraordinary peace the face was stronger than ever , nearly all bone now under the scarce - wrinkled parchment of skin - square jaw and chin , cheekbones , forehead with hollow temples , chiselled nose - the fortress of an unconquerable spirit that had yielded to death , and in its upward sightlessness seemed trying to regain that spirit , to regain the guardianship it had just laid down . Swithin took but one look at the face , and left the room ; the sight , he said afterwards , made him very queer . He went downstairs shaking the whole house , and , seizing his hat , clambered into his brougham , without giving any directions to the coachman . He was driven home , and all the evening sat in his chair without moving . He could take nothing for dinner but a partridge , with an imperial pint of champagne .... Old Jolyon stood at the bottom of the bed , his hands folded in front of him . He alone of those in the room remembered the death of his mother , and though he looked at Ann , it was of that he was thinking . Ann was an old woman , but death had come to her at last - death came to all ! His face did not move , his gaze seemed travelling from very far . Aunt Hester stood beside him . She did not cry now , tears were exhausted - her nature refused to permit a further escape of force ; she twisted her hands , looking not at Ann , but from side to side , seeking some way of escaping the effort of realization . Of all the brothers and sisters James manifested the most emotion . Tears rolled down the parallel furrows of his thin face ; where he should go now to tell his troubles he did not know ; Juley was no good , Hester worse than useless ! He felt Ann 's death more than he had ever thought he should ; this would upset him for weeks ! Presently Aunt Hester stole out , and Aunt Juley began moving about , doing ' what was necessary , ' so that twice she knocked against something . Old Jolyon , roused from his reverie , that reverie of the long , long past , looked sternly at her , and went away . James alone was left by the bedside ; glancing stealthily round , to see that he was not observed , he twisted his long body down , placed a kiss on the dead forehead , then he , too , hastily left the room . Encountering Smither in the hall , he began to ask her about the funeral , and , finding that she knew nothing , complained bitterly that , if they did n't take care , everything would go wrong . She had better send for Mr. Soames - he knew all about that sort of thing ; her master was very much upset , he supposed - he would want looking after ; as for her mistresses , they were no good - they had no gumption ! They would be ill too , he should n't wonder . She had better send for the doctor ; it was best to take things in time . He did n't think his sister Ann had had the best opinion ; if she 'd had Blank she would have been alive now . Smither might send to Park Lane any time she wanted advice . Of course , his carriage was at their service for the funeral . He supposed she had n't such a thing as a glass of claret and a biscuit - he had had no lunch ! The days before the funeral passed quietly . It had long been known , of course , that Aunt Ann had left her little property to Timothy . There was , therefore , no reason for the slightest agitation . Soames , who was sole executor , took charge of all arrangements , and in due course sent out the following invitation to every male member of the family : To ........... Your presence is requested at the funeral of Miss Ann Forsyte , in Highgate Cemetery , at noon of Oct. 1st . Carriages will meet at "
41446	42011	40463	40463	I	0	" Bayswater Road , at 10.45 . No flowers by request . ' R.S.V.P. ' The morning came , cold , with a high , grey , London sky , and at half - past ten the first carriage , that of James , drove up . It contained James and his son - in - law Dartie , a fine man , with a square chest , buttoned very tightly into a frock coat , and a sallow , fattish face adorned with dark , well - curled moustaches , and that incorrigible commencement of whisker which , eluding the strictest attempts at shaving , seems the mark of something deeply ingrained in the personality of the shaver , being especially noticeable in men who speculate . Soames , in his capacity of executor , received the guests , for Timothy still kept his bed ; he would get up after the funeral ; and Aunts Juley and Hester would not be coming down till all was over , when it was understood there would be lunch for anyone who cared to come back . The next to arrive was Roger , still limping from the gout , and encircled by three of his sons - young Roger , Eustace , and Thomas . George , the remaining son , arrived almost immediately afterwards in a hansom , and paused in the hall to ask Soames how he found undertaking pay . They disliked each other . Then came two Haymans - Giles and Jesse perfectly silent , and very well dressed , with special creases down their evening trousers . Then old Jolyon alone . Next , Nicholas , with a healthy colour in his face , and a carefully veiled sprightliness in every movement of his head and body . One of his sons followed him , meek and subdued . Swithin Forsyte , and Bosinney arrived at the same moment , - and stood - bowing precedence to each other , - but on the door opening they tried to enter together ; they renewed their apologies in the hall , and , Swithin , settling his stock , which had become disarranged in the struggle , very slowly mounted the stairs . The other Hayman ; two married sons of Nicholas , together with Tweetyman , Spender , and Warry , the husbands of married Forsyte and Hayman daughters . The company was then complete , twenty - one in all , not a male member of the family being absent but Timothy and young Jolyon . Entering the scarlet and green drawing - room , whose apparel made so vivid a setting for their unaccustomed costumes , each tried nervously to find a seat , desirous of hiding the emphatic blackness of his trousers . There seemed a sort of indecency in that blackness and in the colour of their gloves - a sort of exaggeration of the feelings ; and many cast shocked looks of secret envy at ' the Buccaneer , ' who had no gloves , and was wearing grey trousers . A subdued hum of conversation rose , no one speaking of the departed , but each asking after the other , as though thereby casting an indirect libation to this event , which they had come to honour . And presently James said : "
42022	42279	42014	42014	I	0	" They went downstairs , and , two and two , as they had been told off in strict precedence , mounted the carriages . The hearse started at a foot 's pace ; the carriages moved slowly after . In the first went old Jolyon with Nicholas ; in the second , the twins , Swithin and James ; in the third , Roger and young Roger ; Soames , young Nicholas , George , and Bosinney followed in the fourth . Each of the other carriages , eight in all , held three or four of the family ; behind them came the doctor 's brougham ; then , at a decent interval , cabs containing family clerks and servants ; and at the very end , one containing nobody at all , but bringing the total cortege up to the number of thirteen . So long as the procession kept to the highway of the Bayswater Road , it retained the foot's - pace , but , turning into less important thorough - fares , it soon broke into a trot , and so proceeded , with intervals of walking in the more fashionable streets , until it arrived . In the first carriage old Jolyon and Nicholas were talking of their wills . In the second the twins , after a single attempt , had lapsed into complete silence ; both were rather deaf , and the exertion of making themselves heard was too great . Only once James broke this silence : "
42300	42313	42295	42295	you	0	" And Swithin , fixing him with a dreadful stare , answered : "
42323	42351	42295	42295	you	0	" In the third carriage a disjointed conversation was carried on in the intervals of looking out to see how far they had got , George remarking , "
42365	42534	42359	42362	the poor old lady	1101	" He did n't believe in people living beyond seventy , Young Nicholas replied mildly that the rule did n't seem to apply to the Forsytes . George said he himself intended to commit suicide at sixty . Young Nicholas , smiling and stroking a long chin , did n't think his father would like that theory ; he had made a lot of money since he was sixty . Well , seventy was the outside limit ; it was then time , George said , for them to go and leave their money to their children . Soames , hitherto silent , here joined in ; he had not forgotten the remark about the ' undertaking , ' and , lifting his eyelids almost imperceptibly , said it was all very well for people who never made money to talk . He himself intended to live as long as he could . This was a hit at George , who was notoriously hard up . Bosinney muttered abstractedly "
42539	43754	43755	43756	The Buccaneer	789	" and , George yawning , the conversation dropped . Upon arriving , the coffin was borne into the chapel , and , two by two , the mourners filed in behind it . This guard of men , all attached to the dead by the bond of kinship , was an impressive and singular sight in the great city of London , with its overwhelming diversity of life , its innumerable vocations , pleasures , duties , its terrible hardness , its terrible call to individualism . The family had gathered to triumph over all this , to give a show of tenacious unity , to illustrate gloriously that law of property underlying the growth of their tree , by which it had thriven and spread , trunk and branches , the sap flowing through all , the full growth reached at the appointed time . The spirit of the old woman lying in her last sleep had called them to this demonstration . It was her final appeal to that unity which had been their strength - it was her final triumph that she had died while the tree was yet whole . She was spared the watching of the branches jut out beyond the point of balance . She could not look into the hearts of her followers . The same law that had worked in her , bringing her up from a tall , straight - backed slip of a girl to a woman strong and grown , from a woman grown to a woman old , angular , feeble , almost witchlike , with individuality all sharpened and sharpened , as all rounding from the world 's contact fell off from her - that same law would work , was working , in the family she had watched like a mother . She had seen it young , and growing , she had seen it strong and grown , and before her old eyes had time or strength to see any more , she died . She would have tried , and who knows but she might have kept it young and strong , with her old fingers , her trembling kisses - a little longer ; alas ! not even Aunt Ann could fight with Nature . ' Pride comes before a fall ! ' In accordance with this , the greatest of Nature 's ironies , the Forsyte family had gathered for a last proud pageant before they fell . Their faces to right and left , in single lines , were turned for the most part impassively toward the ground , guardians of their thoughts ; but here and there , one looking upward , with a line between his brows , searched to see some sight on the chapel walls too much for him , to be listening to something that appalled . And the responses , low - muttered , in voices through which rose the same tone , the same unseizable family ring , sounded weird , as though murmured in hurried duplication by a single person . The service in the chapel over , the mourners filed up again to guard the body to the tomb . The vault stood open , and , round it , men in black were waiting . From that high and sacred field , where thousands of the upper middle class lay in their last sleep , the eyes of the Forsytes travelled down across the flocks of graves . There - spreading to the distance , lay London , with no sun over it , mourning the loss of its daughter , mourning with this family , so dear , the loss of her who was mother and guardian . A hundred thousand spires and houses , blurred in the great grey web of property , lay there like prostrate worshippers before the grave of this , the oldest Forsyte of them all . A few words , a sprinkle of earth , the thrusting of the coffin home , and Aunt Ann had passed to her last rest . Round the vault , trustees of that passing , the five brothers stood , with white heads bowed ; they would see that Ann was comfortable where she was going . Her little property must stay behind , but otherwise , all that could be should be done .... Then severally , each stood aside , and putting on his hat , turned back to inspect the new inscription on the marble of the family vault : SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ANN FORSYTE , THE DAUGHTER OF THE ABOVE JOLYON AND ANN FORSYTE , WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE THE 27TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER , 1886 , AGED EIGHTY - SEVEN YEARS AND FOUR DAYS Soon perhaps , someone else would be wanting an inscription . It was strange and intolerable , for they had not thought somehow , that Forsytes could die . And one and all they had a longing to get away from this painfulness , this ceremony which had reminded them of things they could not bear to think about - to get away quickly and go about their business and forget . It was cold , too ; the wind , like some slow , disintegrating force , blowing up the hill over the graves , struck them with its chilly breath ; they began to split into groups , and as quickly as possible to fill the waiting carriages . Swithin said he should go back to lunch at Timothy 's , and he offered to take anybody with him in his brougham . It was considered a doubtful privilege to drive with Swithin in his brougham , which was not a large one ; nobody accepted , and he went off alone . James and Roger followed immediately after ; they also would drop in to lunch . The others gradually melted away , Old Jolyon taking three nephews to fill up his carriage ; he had a want of those young faces . Soames , who had to arrange some details in the cemetery office , walked away with Bosinney . He had much to talk over with him , and , having finished his business , they strolled to Hampstead , lunched together at the Spaniard 's Inn , and spent a long time in going into practical details connected with the building of the house ; they then proceeded to the tram - line , and came as far as the Marble Arch , where Bosinney went off to Stanhope Gate to see June . Soames felt in excellent spirits when he arrived home , and confided to Irene at dinner that he had had a good talk with Bosinney , who really seemed a sensible fellow ; they had had a capital walk too , which had done his liver good - he had been short of exercise for a long time - and altogether a very satisfactory day . If only it had n't been for poor Aunt Ann , he would have taken her to the theatre ; as it was , they must make the best of an evening at home . "
43764	44012	43755	43756	The Buccaneer	789	" he said suddenly . And moved by some inexplicable desire to assert his proprietorship , he rose from his chair and planted a kiss on his wife 's shoulder . PART II CHAPTER I - PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE The winter had been an open one . Things in the trade were slack ; and as Soames had reflected before making up his mind , it had been a good time for building . The shell of the house at Robin Hill was thus completed by the end of April . Now that there was something to be seen for his money , he had been coming down once , twice , even three times a week , and would mouse about among the debris for hours , careful never to soil his clothes , moving silently through the unfinished brickwork of doorways , or circling round the columns in the central court . And he would stand before them for minutes ' together , as though peering into the real quality of their substance . On April 30 he had an appointment with Bosinney to go over the accounts , and five minutes before the proper time he entered the tent which the architect had pitched for himself close to the old oak tree . The accounts were already prepared on a folding table , and with a nod Soames sat down to study them . It was some time before he raised his head . "
44020	44026	44013	44013	I	0	" he said at last ; "
44038	44051	44013	44013	I	0	" After a glance at Bosinney 's face he went on quickly : "
44106	44112	44113	44113	I	0	" Bosinney shook his head : "
44122	44144	44113	44113	I	0	" Soames pushed back the table with a movement of anger , which sent the account sheets fluttering to the ground . "
44152	44157	44158	44158	you	1105	" he flustered out , "
44167	44168	44158	44158	you	1105	" "
44177	44182	44169	44169	I	0	" Bosinney answered sharply , "
44201	44202	44189	44189	I	0	" "
44207	44211	44203	44203	I	0	" growled Soames : "
44242	44343	44344	44344	I	0	" The qualities of both men had contributed to this not - inconsiderable discrepancy . On the one hand , the architect 's devotion to his idea , to the image of a house which he had created and believed in - had made him nervous of being stopped , or forced to the use of makeshifts ; on the other , Soames ' not less true and wholehearted devotion to the very best article that could be obtained for the money , had rendered him averse to believing that things worth thirteen shillings could not be bought with twelve . "
44353	44358	44359	44359	You	1105	" said Bosinney suddenly . "
44451	44565	44566	44566	You	1105	" Soames regained his composure . Knowing that Bosinney had no capital , he regarded this as a wild suggestion . He saw , too , that he would be kept indefinitely out of this house on which he had set his heart , and just at the crucial point when the architect 's personal care made all the difference . In the meantime there was Irene to be thought of ! She had been very queer lately . He really believed it was only because she had taken to Bosinney that she tolerated the idea of the house at all . It would not do to make an open breach with her . "
44574	44578	44566	44566	You	1105	" he said . "
44633	44634	44624	44624	I	0	" "
44638	44656	44657	44657	You	1105	" said Bosinney , and Soames was both annoyed and surprised by the shrewdness of his glance . "
44733	44776	44712	44716	a first - rate man	1000	" Soames saw that he really meant what he said , and , angry though he was , the consequences of a row rose before him too vividly . He saw his house unfinished , his wife rebellious , himself a laughingstock . "
44783	44788	44712	44716	a first - rate man	1000	" he said sulkily , "
44797	44798	44712	44716	a first - rate man	1000	" "
44802	44806	44712	44716	a first - rate man	1000	" assented Bosinney . "
44833	44845	44828	44828	June	166	" Soames cast a stealthy look at him , and said : "
44857	45078	45080	45080	you	1117	" He was always coming to their place ! There had been rain the night before - a spring rain , and the earth smelt of sap and wild grasses . The warm , soft breeze swung the leaves and the golden buds of the old oak tree , and in the sunshine the blackbirds were whistling their hearts out . It was such a spring day as breathes into a man an ineffable yearning , a painful sweetness , a longing that makes him stand motionless , looking at the leaves or grass , and fling out his arms to embrace he knows not what . The earth gave forth a fainting warmth , stealing up through the chilly garment in which winter had wrapped her . It was her long caress of invitation , to draw men down to lie within her arms , to roll their bodies on her , and put their lips to her breast . On just such a day as this Soames had got from Irene the promise he had asked her for so often . Seated on the fallen trunk of a tree , he had promised for the twentieth time that if their marriage were not a success , she should be as free as if she had never married him ! "
45084	45105	45080	45080	you	1117	" she had said . A few days back she had reminded him of that oath . He had answered : "
45117	45462	45108	45108	I	0	" By some awkward fatality he remembered it now . What queer things men would swear for the sake of women ! He would have sworn it at any time to gain her ! He would swear it now , if thereby he could touch her - but nobody could touch her , she was cold - hearted ! And memories crowded on him with the fresh , sweet savour of the spring wind - memories of his courtship . In the spring of the year 1881 he was visiting his old school - fellow and client , George Liversedge , of Branksome , who , with the view of developing his pine - woods in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth , had placed the formation of the company necessary to the scheme in Soames 's hands . Mrs. Liversedge , with a sense of the fitness of things , had given a musical tea in his honour . Later in the course of this function , which Soames , no musician , had regarded as an unmitigated bore , his eye had been caught by the face of a girl dressed in mourning , standing by herself . The lines of her tall , as yet rather thin figure , showed through the wispy , clinging stuff of her black dress , her black - gloved hands were crossed in front of her , her lips slightly parted , and her large , dark eyes wandered from face to face . Her hair , done low on her neck , seemed to gleam above her black collar like coils of shining metal . And as Soames stood looking at her , the sensation that most men have felt at one time or another went stealing through him - a peculiar satisfaction of the senses , a peculiar certainty , which novelists and old ladies call love at first sight . Still stealthily watching her , he at once made his way to his hostess , and stood doggedly waiting for the music to cease . "
45474	45478	45465	45472	that girl with yellow hair and dark eyes	1118	" he asked . "
45516	45517	45502	45502	She	201	" "
45523	45995	45502	45502	She	201	" said Soames . It was very little that he found to say , nor did he find her responsive to that little . But he went away with the resolution to see her again . He effected his object by chance , meeting her on the pier with her stepmother , who had the habit of walking there from twelve to one of a forenoon . Soames made this lady 's acquaintance with alacrity , nor was it long before he perceived in her the ally he was looking for . His keen scent for the commercial side of family life soon told him that Irene cost her stepmother more than the fifty pounds a year she brought her ; it also told him that Mrs. Heron , a woman yet in the prime of life , desired to be married again . The strange ripening beauty of her stepdaughter stood in the way of this desirable consummation . And Soames , in his stealthy tenacity , laid his plans . He left Bournemouth without having given himself away , but in a month 's time came back , and this time he spoke , not to the girl , but to her stepmother . He had made up his mind , he said ; he would wait any time . And he had long to wait , watching Irene bloom , the lines of her young figure softening , the stronger blood deepening the gleam of her eyes , and warming her face to a creamy glow ; and at each visit he proposed to her , and when that visit was at an end , took her refusal away with him , back to London , sore at heart , but steadfast and silent as the grave . He tried to come at the secret springs of her resistance ; only once had he a gleam of light . It was at one of those assembly dances , which afford the only outlet to the passions of the population of seaside watering - places . He was sitting with her in an embrasure , his senses tingling with the contact of the waltz . She had looked at him over her , slowly waving fan ; and he had lost his head . Seizing that moving wrist , he pressed his lips to the flesh of her arm . And she had shuddered - to this day he had not forgotten that shudder - nor the look so passionately averse she had given him . A year after that she had yielded . What had made her yield he could never make out ; and from Mrs. Heron , a woman of some diplomatic talent , he learnt nothing . Once after they were married he asked her , "
46004	46169	45502	45502	She	201	" She had answered by a strange silence . An enigma to him from the day that he first saw her , she was an enigma to him still .... Bosinney was waiting for him at the door ; and on his rugged , good - looking , face was a queer , yearning , yet happy look , as though he too saw a promise of bliss in the spring sky , sniffed a coming happiness in the spring air . Soames looked at him waiting there . What was the matter with the fellow that he looked so happy ? What was he waiting for with that smile on his lips and in his eyes ? Soames could not see that for which Bosinney was waiting as he stood there drinking in the flower - scented wind . And once more he felt baffled in the presence of this man whom by habit he despised . He hastened on to the house . "
46177	46184	45502	45502	She	201	" he heard Bosinney say , - "
46256	46260	46261	46261	You	0	" Soames said : "
46269	46275	46261	46261	You	0	" Bosinney evaded the question . "
46291	46296	46276	46276	You	0	" Soames smiled superciliously . "
46306	46310	46297	46297	I	0	" he said , "
46317	46338	46339	46339	I	0	" They found little else to say to each other , but on the way to the Station Soames asked : "
46347	46348	46341	46341	you	0	" "
46351	46363	46341	46341	you	0	" The abrupt answer was as distinct a snub as saying : "
46378	46412	46375	46376	someone else	3348	" And the slow , sulky anger Soames had felt all the afternoon burned the brighter within him . Neither spoke again till they were close to the Station , then Soames asked : "
46421	46422	46415	46415	you	0	" "
46439	46443	46430	46430	you	0	" Soames nodded . "
46449	46453	46445	46445	you	0	" he said , "
46499	46610	46627	46627	You	296	" Bosinney made no reply . And Soames gave him askance a look of dogged dislike - for in spite of his fastidious air and that supercilious , dandified taciturnity , Soames , with his set lips and squared chin , was not unlike a bulldog .... When , at seven o'clock that evening , June arrived at 62 , Montpellier Square , the maid Bilson told her that Mr. Bosinney was in the drawing - room ; the mistress - she said - was dressing , and would be down in a minute . She would tell her that Miss June was here . June stopped her at once . "
46616	46620	46614	46614	Bilson	296	" she said , "
46635	46784	46632	46633	Mrs. Soames	177	" She took off her cloak , and Bilson , with an understanding look , did not even open the drawing - room door for her , but ran downstairs . June paused for a moment to look at herself in the little old - fashioned silver mirror above the oaken rug chest - a slim , imperious young figure , with a small resolute face , in a white frock , cut moon - shaped at the base of a neck too slender for her crown of twisted red - gold hair . She opened the drawing - room door softly , meaning to take him by surprise . The room was filled with a sweet hot scent of flowering azaleas . She took a long breath of the perfume , and heard Bosinney 's voice , not in the room , but quite close , saying . "
46807	46813	46793	46793	I	0	" Irene 's voice answered : "
46819	46820	46793	46793	I	0	" "
46826	46902	46907	46907	yourself	1132	" June 's first thought was to go away , but instead she crossed to the long window opening on the little court . It was from there that the scent of the azaleas came , and , standing with their backs to her , their faces buried in the golden - pink blossoms , stood her lover and Irene . Silent but unashamed , with flaming cheeks and angry eyes , the girl watched . "
46917	46961	46907	46907	yourself	1132	" June saw Irene look up at him through her screen of blossoms . It was not the look of a coquette , but - far worse to the watching girl - of a woman fearful lest that look should say too much . "
46973	46974	46975	46977	The big one	1135	" "
46997	46998	46980	46980	him	1134	" "
47004	47023	47001	47002	Uncle Swithin	233	" A wave of the azalea scent drifted into June 's face ; she felt sick and dizzy . "
47030	47031	47001	47002	Uncle Swithin	233	" "
47035	47036	47037	47037	I	0	" "
47052	47070	47043	47043	I	0	" The answer seemed to the girl to come softly with a tremble from amongst the blossoms : "
47075	47087	47072	47072	I	0	" And she stepped into the open space of the window . "
47094	47098	47072	47072	I	0	" she said ; "
47106	47120	47099	47099	I	0	" Her eyes , so angry and direct , swept both their faces . "
47145	47156	47157	47157	I	0	" ' From Irene 's face the colour had flown . "
47169	47173	47174	47175	Uncle Swithin	233	" she answered . "
47188	47189	47182	47182	You	1132	" "
47201	47217	47190	47190	I	0	" There was a sound of footsteps and June saw Soames standing just behind her . "
47226	47241	47182	47182	You	1132	" said Irene , looking from one to the other with a strange smile , "
47246	47296	47182	47182	You	1132	" CHAPTER II - JUNE 'S TREAT Dinner began in silence ; the women facing one another , and the men . In silence the soup was finished - excellent , if a little thick ; and fish was brought . In silence it was handed . Bosinney ventured : "
47304	47309	47182	47182	You	1132	" Irene echoed softly : "
47317	47318	47182	47182	You	1132	" "
47321	47325	47182	47182	You	1132	" said June : "
47334	47369	47370	47370	You	1132	" No one replied . The fish was taken away , a fine fresh sole from Dover . And Bilson brought champagne , a bottle swathed around the neck with white .... Soames said : "
47376	47402	47370	47370	You	1132	" Cutlets were handed , each pink - frilled about the legs . They were refused by June , and silence fell . Soames said : "
47417	47434	47410	47410	June	166	" But June again refused , so they were borne away . And then Irene asked : "
47443	47447	47435	47435	Phil	168	" Bosinney answered : "
47469	47470	47464	47464	him	1139	" "
47477	47478	47474	47475	a darling	1141	" "
47483	47494	47481	47481	sir	730	" Spring chicken was removed . But Soames was speaking : "
47517	47521	47510	47510	June	166	" June said : "
47534	47549	47528	47528	Wine	297	" An apple charlotte came upon a silver dish , and smilingly Irene said : "
47558	47564	47528	47528	Wine	297	" To this Bosinney murmured : "
47572	47576	47528	47528	Wine	297	" June said : "
47590	47600	47588	47588	Bilson	296	" Sugar was handed her , and Soames remarked : "
47605	47621	47588	47588	Bilson	296	" The charlotte was removed . Long silence followed . Irene , beckoning , said : "
47637	47638	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" "
47645	47667	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" said June . Olives from France , with Russian caviare , were placed on little plates . And Soames remarked : "
47676	47693	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" But no one answered . The olives were removed . Lifting her tumbler June demanded : "
47701	47737	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" Water was given her . A silver tray was brought , with German plums . There was a lengthy pause . In perfect harmony all were eating them . Bosinney counted up the stones : "
47747	47752	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" Irene finished softly : "
47772	47776	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" He answered : "
47781	47792	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" Their eyes had met , and June cried scornfully : "
47797	47814	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" Egyptian cigarettes were handed in a silver box . Soames , taking one , remarked : "
47822	47842	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" No one replied , and Turkish coffee followed in enamelled cups . Irene , smiling quietly , said : "
47846	47847	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" "
47851	47855	47629	47630	Miss June	166	" said June . "
47865	47879	47880	47880	Bosinney	168	" Brandy was handed ; it was pale and old . Soames said : "
47887	47897	47880	47880	Bosinney	168	" Bosinney took a glass ; they all arose . "
47903	47910	47898	47898	You	296	" asked Soames . June answered : "
47919	47933	47917	47917	Bilson	296	" Her cloak was brought . Irene , from the window , murmured : "
47945	47949	47972	47972	Phil	168	" Soames added : "
47960	47967	47952	47952	I	0	" From the door June answered : "
47974	47978	47972	47972	Phil	168	" Bosinney cried : "
47983	47993	47972	47972	Phil	168	" Soames smiled a sneering smile , and said : "
47999	48012	47994	47994	I	0	" And at the door Irene watched them go . Bosinney called : "
48016	48017	47994	47994	I	0	" "
48021	48573	48576	48576	he	1145	" she answered softly .... June made her lover take her on the top of a ' bus , saying she wanted air , and there sat silent , with her face to the breeze . The driver turned once or twice , with the intention of venturing a remark , but thought better of it . They were a lively couple ! The spring had got into his blood , too ; he felt the need for letting steam escape , and clucked his tongue , flourishing his whip , wheeling his horses , and even they , poor things , had smelled the spring , and for a brief half - hour spurned the pavement with happy hoofs . The whole town was alive ; the boughs , curled upward with their decking of young leaves , awaited some gift the breeze could bring . New - lighted lamps were gaining mastery , and the faces of the crowd showed pale under that glare , while on high the great white clouds slid swiftly , softly , over the purple sky . Men in , evening dress had thrown back overcoats , stepping jauntily up the steps of Clubs ; working folk loitered ; and women - those women who at that time of night are solitary - solitary and moving eastward in a stream - swung slowly along , with expectation in their gait , dreaming of good wine and a good supper , or - for an unwonted minute , of kisses given for love . Those countless figures , going their ways under the lamps and the moving - sky , had one and all received some restless blessing from the stir of spring . And one and all , like those clubmen with their opened coats , had shed something of caste , and creed , and custom , and by the cock of their hats , the pace of their walk , their laughter , or their silence , revealed their common kinship under the passionate heavens . Bosinney and June entered the theatre in silence , and mounted to their seats in the upper boxes . The piece had just begun , and the half - darkened house , with its rows of creatures peering all one way , resembled a great garden of flowers turning their faces to the sun . June had never before been in the upper boxes . From the age of fifteen she had habitually accompanied her grandfather to the stalls , and not common stalls , but the best seats in the house , towards the centre of the third row , booked by old Jolyon , at Grogan and Boyne 's , on his way home from the City , long before the day ; carried in his overcoat pocket , together with his cigar - case and his old kid gloves , and handed to June to keep till the appointed night . And in those stalls - an erect old figure with a serene white head , a little figure , strenuous and eager , with a red - gold head - they would sit through every kind of play , and on the way home old Jolyon would say of the principal actor : "
48589	48752	48586	48587	little Bobson	302	" She had looked forward to this evening with keen delight ; it was stolen , chaperone - less , undreamed of at Stanhope Gate , where she was supposed to be at Soames ' . She had expected reward for her subterfuge , planned for her lover 's sake ; she had expected it to break up the thick , chilly cloud , and make the relations between them which of late had been so puzzling , so tormenting - sunny and simple again as they had been before the winter . She had come with the intention of saying something definite ; and she looked at the stage with a furrow between her brows , seeing nothing , her hands squeezed together in her lap . A swarm of jealous suspicions stung and stung her . If Bosinney was conscious of her trouble he made no sign . The curtain dropped . The first act had come to an end . "
48759	48764	48765	48765	I	0	" said the girl ; "
48772	48843	48765	48765	I	0	" She was very white , and she knew - for with her nerves thus sharpened she saw everything - that he was both uneasy and compunctious . At the back of the theatre an open balcony hung over the street ; she took possession of this , and stood leaning there without a word , waiting for him to begin . At last she could bear it no longer . "
48854	48858	48844	48844	I	0	" she said . "
48861	48883	48884	48884	You	1148	" The defensive tone of his voice brought the colour flying to her cheek , the words flying to her lips : "
48904	48921	48922	48922	You	1148	" Bosinney stared down at the street . He made no answer .... June cried passionately : "
48941	49020	49021	49021	Phil	168	" A hum rose from the street , and , piercing it with a sharp ' ping , ' the bell sounded for the raising of the curtain . June did not stir . A desperate struggle was going on within her . Should she put everything to the proof ? Should she challenge directly that influence , that attraction which was driving him away from her ? It was her nature to challenge , and she said : "
49032	49087	49021	49021	Phil	168	" With a smile quivering and breaking on her lips , and trying , how hard , not to show that she was watching , she searched his face , saw it waver and hesitate , saw a troubled line come between his brows , the blood rush into his face . He answered : "
49097	49098	49021	49021	Phil	168	" "
49113	49123	49124	49124	I	0	" He made an evident effort , and said : "
49129	49130	49131	49131	You	2284	" "
49137	49151	49131	49131	You	2284	" His eyes grew angry ; he shrugged his shoulders , and answered : "
49165	49275	49131	49131	You	2284	" June bit her lip till the blood came , and walked back to her seat without another word , but she could not help the tears of rage rolling down her face . The house had been mercifully darkened for a crisis , and no one could see her trouble . Yet in this world of Forsytes let no man think himself immune from observation . In the third row behind , Euphemia , Nicholas 's youngest daughter , with her married - sister , Mrs. Tweetyman , were watching . They reported at Timothy 's , how they had seen June and her fiance at the theatre . "
49280	49281	49131	49131	You	2284	" "
49288	49289	49131	49131	You	2284	" "
49311	49408	49409	49409	My	0	" Well - not exactly . In the .... Anyway , that engagement would n't last long . They had never seen anyone look so thunder and lightningy as that little June ! With tears of enjoyment in their eyes , they related how she had kicked a man 's hat as she returned to her seat in the middle of an act , and how the man had looked . Euphemia had a noted , silent laugh , terminating most disappointingly in squeaks ; and when Mrs. Small , holding up her hands , said : "
49418	49448	49409	49409	My	0	" she let out such a number of these that she had to be recovered with smelling - salts . As she went away she said to Mrs. Tweetyman : "
49462	49583	49458	49458	I	0	" For ' that little June ' this evening , that was to have been ' her treat , ' was the most miserable she had ever spent . God knows she tried to stifle her pride , her suspicion , her jealousy ! She parted from Bosinney at old Jolyon 's door without breaking down ; the feeling that her lover must be conquered was strong enough to sustain her till his retiring footsteps brought home the true extent of her wretchedness . The noiseless ' Sankey ' let her in . She would have slipped up to her own room , but old Jolyon , who had heard her entrance , was in the dining - room doorway . "
49591	49595	49458	49458	I	0	" he said . "
49614	49662	49663	49663	We	1156	" June stood at the fireplace , with a foot on the fender and an arm on the mantelpiece , as her grandfather had done when he came in that night of the opera . She was too near a breakdown to care what she told him . "
49669	49670	49663	49663	We	1156	" "
49684	49685	49682	49682	Bosinney	168	" "
49688	49762	49682	49682	Bosinney	168	" Old Jolyon 's glance was fixed on her with the penetrating gaze from which it was difficult to hide ; but she was not looking at him , and when she turned her face , he dropped his scrutiny at once . He had seen enough , and too much . He bent down to lift the cup of milk for her from the hearth , and , turning away , grumbled : "
49779	49808	49682	49682	Bosinney	168	" He was invisible now behind his paper , which he turned with a vicious crackle ; but when June came up to kiss him , he said : "
49816	49941	49682	49682	Bosinney	168	" in a tone so tremulous and unexpected , that it was all the girl could do to get out of the room without breaking into the fit of sobbing which lasted her well on into the night . When the door was closed , old Jolyon dropped his paper , and stared long and anxiously in front of him . ' The beggar ! ' he thought . ' I always knew she 'd have trouble with him ! ' Uneasy doubts and suspicions , the more poignant that he felt himself powerless to check or control the march of events , came crowding upon him . Was the fellow going to jilt her ? He longed to go and say to him : "
49958	50100	49949	49949	you	0	" But how could he ? Knowing little or nothing , he was yet certain , with his unerring astuteness , that there was something going on . He suspected Bosinney of being too much at Montpellier Square . ' This fellow , ' he thought , ' may not be a scamp ; his face is not a bad one , but he 's a queer fish . I do n't know what to make of him . I shall never know what to make of him ! They tell me he works like a nigger , but I see no good coming of it . He 's unpractical , he has no method . When he comes here , he sits as glum as a monkey . If I ask him what wine he 'll have , he says : "
50106	50536	50537	50537	Adolf	228	" If I offer him a cigar , he smokes it as if it were a twopenny German thing . I never see him looking at June as he ought to look at her ; and yet , he 's not after her money . If she were to make a sign , he 'd be off his bargain to - morrow . But she wo n't - not she ! She 'll stick to him ! She 's as obstinate as fate - She 'll never let go ! ' Sighing deeply , he turned the paper ; in its columns , perchance he might find consolation . And upstairs in her room June sat at her open window , where the spring wind came , after its revel across the Park , to cool her hot cheeks and burn her heart . CHAPTER III - DRIVE WITH SWITHIN Two lines of a certain song in a certain famous old school 's songbook run as follows : ' How the buttons on his blue frock shone , tra - la - la ! How he carolled and he sang , like a bird ! ... ' Swithin did not exactly carol and sing like a bird , but he felt almost like endeavouring to hum a tune , as he stepped out of Hyde Park Mansions , and contemplated his horses drawn up before the door . The afternoon was as balmy as a day in June , and to complete the simile of the old song , he had put on a blue frock - coat , dispensing with an overcoat , after sending Adolf down three times to make sure that there was not the least suspicion of east in the wind ; and the frock - coat was buttoned so tightly around his personable form , that , if the buttons did not shine , they might pardonably have done so . Majestic on the pavement he fitted on a pair of dog - skin gloves ; with his large bell - shaped top hat , and his great stature and bulk he looked too primeval for a Forsyte . His thick white hair , on which Adolf had bestowed a touch of pomatum , exhaled the fragrance of opoponax and cigars - the celebrated Swithin brand , for which he paid one hundred and forty shillings the hundred , and of which old Jolyon had unkindly said , he would n't smoke them as a gift ; they wanted the stomach of a horse ! "
50539	50540	50541	50541	Sare	306	" "
50543	50544	50541	50541	Sare	306	" "
50550	50572	50578	50578	I	0	" He would never teach that fellow to look smart ; and Mrs. Soames he felt sure , had an eye ! "
50590	50683	50578	50578	I	0	" A pretty woman would want to show off her frock ; and well - he was going to drive a lady ! It was like a new beginning to the good old days . Ages since he had driven a woman ! The last time , if he remembered , it had been Juley ; the poor old soul had been as nervous as a cat the whole time , and so put him out of patience that , as he dropped her in the Bayswater Road , he had said : "
50697	51091	50691	50691	I	0	" And he never had , not he ! Going up to his horses ' heads , he examined their bits ; not that he knew anything about bits - he did n't pay his coachman sixty pounds a year to do his work for him , that had never been his principle . Indeed , his reputation as a horsey man rested mainly on the fact that once , on Derby Day , he had been welshed by some thimble - riggers . But someone at the Club , after seeing him drive his greys up to the door - he always drove grey horses , you got more style for the money , some thought - had called him ' Four - in - hand Forsyte . ' The name having reached his ears through that fellow Nicholas Treffry , old Jolyon 's dead partner , the great driving man notorious for more carriage accidents than any man in the kingdom - Swithin had ever after conceived it right to act up to it . The name had taken his fancy , not because he had ever driven four - in - hand , or was ever likely to , but because of something distinguished in the sound . Four - in - hand Forsyte ! Not bad ! Born too soon , Swithin had missed his vocation . Coming upon London twenty years later , he could not have failed to have become a stockbroker , but at the time when he was obliged to select , this great profession had not as yet became the chief glory of the upper - middle class . He had literally been forced into land agency . Once in the driving seat , with the reins handed to him , and blinking over his pale old cheeks in the full sunlight , he took a slow look round - Adolf was already up behind ; the cockaded groom at the horses ' heads stood ready to let go ; everything was prepared for the signal , and Swithin gave it . The equipage dashed forward , and before you could say Jack Robinson , with a rattle and flourish drew up at Soames ' door . Irene came out at once , and stepped in - he afterward described it at Timothy 's - "
51112	51136	50691	50691	I	0	" and above all , Swithin dwelt on this , staring at Mrs. Septimus in a way that disconcerted her a good deal , "
51141	51151	51155	51155	your	1164	" To Aunt Hester he portrayed Irene 's hat . "
51181	51191	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" he made a circular motion of his hand , "
51198	51199	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" "
51206	51224	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" inquired Aunt Hester , who manifested a languid but permanent excitement at any mention of dress . "
51228	51232	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" returned Swithin ; "
51239	51304	51236	51236	I	0	" He sank into silence so profound that Aunt Hester began to be afraid he had fallen into a trance . She did not try to rouse him herself , it not being her custom . ' I wish somebody would come , ' she thought ; ' I do n't like the look of him ! ' But suddenly Swithin returned to life . "
51307	51313	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" he wheezed out slowly , "
51321	51445	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" They had not gone four miles before Swithin received the impression that Irene liked driving with him . Her face was so soft behind that white veil , and her dark eyes shone so in the spring light , and whenever he spoke she raised them to him and smiled . On Saturday morning Soames had found her at her writing - table with a note written to Swithin , putting him off . Why did she want to put him off ? he asked . She might put her own people off when she liked , he would not have her putting off his people ! She had looked at him intently , had torn up the note , and said : "
51449	51473	51098	51098	Taglioni	308	" And then she began writing another . He took a casual glance presently , and saw that it was addressed to Bosinney . "
51482	51500	51476	51476	you	1166	" he asked . Irene , looking at him again with that intent look , said quietly : "
51510	51511	51512	51512	Humph	309	" "
51514	51519	51512	51512	Humph	309	" said Soames , - "
51522	51523	51512	51512	Humph	309	" "
51539	51851	51856	51856	her	1168	" He said no more . Swithin opened his eyes at the mention of Robin Hill ; it was a long way for his horses , and he always dined at half - past seven , before the rush at the Club began ; the new chef took more trouble with an early dinner - a lazy rascal ! He would like to have a look at the house , however . A house appealed to any Forsyte , and especially to one who had been an auctioneer . After all he said the distance was nothing . When he was a younger man he had had rooms at Richmond for many years , kept his carriage and pair there , and drove them up and down to business every day of his life . Four - in - hand Forsyte they called him ! His T - cart , his horses had been known from Hyde Park Corner to the Star and Garter . The Duke of Z .... wanted to get hold of them , would have given him double the money , but he had kept them ; know a good thing when you have it , eh ? A look of solemn pride came portentously on his shaven square old face , he rolled his head in his stand - up collar , like a turkey - cock preening himself . She was really - a charming woman ! He enlarged upon her frock afterwards to Aunt Juley , who held up her hands at his way of putting it . Fitted her like a skin - tight as a drum ; that was how he liked 'em , all of a piece , none of your daverdy , scarecrow women ! He gazed at Mrs. Septimus Small , who took after James - long and thin . "
51858	51863	51856	51856	her	1168	" he went on , "
51878	51879	51870	51870	she	1168	" "
51894	51911	51880	51880	She	1168	" drawled Aunt Hester from her corner . Swithin heard extremely well when anybody attacked him . "
51916	51920	51921	51921	I	0	" he said . "
51969	51970	51965	51965	you	1170	" "
51973	51978	51965	51965	you	1170	" murmured Aunt Hester , "
51982	52168	51980	51980	Juley	237	" Long before they reached Robin Hill , however , the unaccustomed airing had made him terribly sleepy ; he drove with his eyes closed , a life - time of deportment alone keeping his tall and bulky form from falling askew . Bosinney , who was watching , came out to meet them , and all three entered the house together ; Swithin in front making play with a stout gold - mounted Malacca cane , put into his hand by Adolf , for his knees were feeling the effects of their long stay in the same position . He had assumed his fur coat , to guard against the draughts of the unfinished house . The staircase - he said - was handsome ! the baronial style ! They would want some statuary about ! He came to a standstill between the columns of the doorway into the inner court , and held out his cane inquiringly . What was this to be - this vestibule , or whatever they called it ? But gazing at the skylight , inspiration came to him . "
52176	52197	51965	51965	you	1170	" When told it was to be a tiled court with plants in the centre , he turned to Irene : "
52214	52282	52290	52290	he	0	" Irene smiled . She had lifted her veil , banding it like a nun 's coif across her forehead , and the smile of her dark eyes below this seemed to Swithin more charming than ever . He nodded . She would take his advice he saw . He had little to say of the drawing or dining - rooms , which he described as ' spacious "
52320	52327	52328	52328	he	0	" You 'll have room here , "
52331	52345	52328	52328	he	0	" for six or seven hundred dozen - a very pooty little cellar ! "
52367	52376	52377	52377	he	0	" There 's a fine view from here , "
52380	52391	52377	52377	he	0	" you have n't such a thing as a chair ? "
52402	52407	52408	52408	he	0	" You go down , "
52412	52426	52408	52408	he	0	" you two ! I 'll sit here and look at the view . "
53205	53214	53202	53202	his	1196	" You must know - I love you ! "
53292	53295	53296	53297	The rascal	1204	" Adolf ! "
53506	53515	53516	53516	he	1207	" You 'll never make anything of this ! "
53526	53530	53516	53516	he	1207	" too newfangled ! "
53551	53569	53543	53543	Swithin	233	" an extravagant sort of fellow very odd way of looking at you - a bumpy beggar ! "
53763	53773	53752	53752	Swithin	233	" Why , you 're quite a Monte Cristo ! "
53845	53851	53852	53852	he	233	" A very nice wine , "
53863	53871	53852	53852	he	233	" not the equal of my Heidsieck ! "
53894	53911	53884	53884	he	233	" I should n't wonder a bit if that architect chap were sweet upon Mrs. Soames ! "
53932	53936	53937	53937	he	233	" The fellow , "
53943	53983	53937	53937	he	233	" follows her about with his eyes like a dog - the bumpy beggar ! I do n't wonder at it - she 's a very charming woman , and , I should say , the pink of discretion ! "
54017	54026	54027	54027	he	233	" But I was n't sure of it , "
54030	54040	54027	54027	he	233	" till I saw him pick up her handkerchief . "
54049	54058	54059	54059	she	177	" And did he give it her back ? "
54062	54067	54069	54069	Swithin	233	" Give it back ? "
54071	54086	54069	54069	Swithin	233	" I saw him slobber on it when he thought I was n't looking ! "
54096	54104	54107	54107	Swithin	233	" But she gave him no encouragement , "
54795	54807	54792	54792	her	186	" Are we going to have an accident , Uncle Swithin ? "
54815	54825	54808	54808	He	233	" It 's nothing ; a - little fresh ! "
54826	54835	54792	54792	her	186	" I 've never been in an accident . "
54836	54842	54843	54843	He	233	" Do n't you move ! "
54857	54861	54862	54862	he	233	" Sit still , "
54865	54875	54862	54862	he	233	" Never fear , I 'll get you home ! "
54901	54912	54891	54891	her	186	" I do n't care if I never get home ! "
54955	54957	54959	54959	Swithin	233	" When "
54966	55018	54959	54959	Swithin	233	" I pulled 'em up , there she was as cool as myself . God bless my soul ! she behaved as if she did n't care whether she broke her neck or not ! What was it she said : ' I do n't care if I never get home ? "
55037	55057	55027	55027	he	233	" And I 'm not altogether surprised , with a finickin ' feller like young Soames for a husband ! "
55263	55275	55277	55278	Aunt Juley	237	" And what a dreadful thing to say , my dear ! "
55280	55292	55277	55278	Aunt Juley	237	" that about not going home . What did she mean ? "
55321	55325	55326	55327	Mrs. Small	177	" Almost rude ! "
56093	56097	56088	56089	young Roger	317	" Old cat ! "
56108	56114	56103	56103	her	303	" Oh ! those three ! "
56849	56869	56846	56846	his	1299	" Yes , yes - she and young Dyson ; they tell me they 're living at Monte Carlo ! "
58359	58375	58346	58346	Bosinney	168	" How do you do , Mr. Forsyte ? Come down to see for yourself ? "
58407	58412	58397	58397	He	1299	" How are you ? "
58437	58448	58449	58449	he	1299	" I should like to walk round the outside first , "
58452	58461	58449	58449	he	1299	" and see what you 've been doing ! "
58520	58527	58528	58528	he	1299	" Now what did this cost ? "
58541	58547	58549	58549	Bosinney	168	" What should you think ? "
58551	58557	58559	58559	James	173	" How should I know ? "
58563	58573	58559	58559	James	173	" two or three hundred , I dare say ! "
58574	58579	58580	58580	James	173	" The exact sum ! "
58617	58624	58625	58625	he	1299	" That ought to come down , "
58635	58657	58625	58625	he	1299	" You think so ? You think that with the tree there you do n't get enough view for your money . "
58675	58678	58679	58679	he	1299	" Well ! "
58690	58702	58679	58679	he	1299	" I do n't see what you want with a tree . "
58703	58712	58714	58714	Bosinney	168	" It shall come down to - morrow , "
58720	58723	58724	58724	he	1299	" Oh , "
58727	58746	58724	58724	he	1299	" do n't go saying I said it was to come down ! I know nothing about it ! "
58747	58750	58751	58751	James	173	" No ? "
58758	58784	58751	58751	James	173	" Why , what should I know about it ? It 's nothing to do with me ! You do it on your own responsibility . "
58785	58795	58796	58796	James	173	" You 'll allow me to mention your name ? "
58803	58816	58817	58817	he	1299	" I do n't know what you want mentioning my name for , "
58820	58835	58817	58817	he	1299	" you 'd better leave the tree alone . It 's not your tree ! "
58865	58879	58880	58880	he	1299	" You must have spent a douce of a lot of money here , "
58894	58907	58880	58880	he	1299	" Now , what did it cost to put up those columns ? "
58908	58918	58921	58921	Bosinney	168	" I ca n't tell you off - hand , "
58923	58935	58921	58921	Bosinney	168	" but I know it was a deuce of a lot ! "
58936	58942	58944	58944	James	173	" I should think so , "
58946	58950	58944	58944	James	173	" I should .... "
59305	59342	59344	59344	he	1299	" I dare say you see a good deal of my daughter - in - law ; now , what does she think of the house ? But she has n't seen it , I suppose ? "
59434	59453	59426	59426	his	2450	" She has seen the house , but I ca n't tell you what she thinks of it . "
59468	59471	59472	59472	he	1299	" Oh ! "
59489	59494	59481	59481	Soames	171	" Bosinney smilingly replied : "
59499	59500	59481	59481	Soames	171	" "
59509	59510	59504	59504	she	186	" "
59515	59516	59504	59504	she	186	" "
59523	59524	59525	59525	I	0	" "
59540	59556	59531	59531	I	0	" To James , who knew that it was Swithin , this answer appeared incomprehensible . "
59559	59563	59564	59564	you	173	" he stammered , "
59568	59578	59564	59564	you	173	" but he stopped , suddenly perceiving his danger . "
59581	59585	59596	59596	you	173	" he said , "
59605	59616	59600	59600	Nobody	2292	" Somewhat to his surprise Bosinney asked him a question . "
59621	59625	59627	59627	you	173	" he said , "
59652	59653	59627	59627	you	173	" "
59657	59662	59627	59627	you	173	" said James bewildered , "
59681	59974	59975	59975	I	0	" Looking at the ground he held out his hand , crossed the palm of it with Bosinney 's , and taking his umbrella just above the silk , walked away along the terrace . Before he turned the corner he glanced back , and saw Bosinney following him slowly - ' slinking along the wall ' as he put it to himself , ' like a great cat . ' He paid no attention when the young fellow raised his hat . Outside the drive , and out of sight , he slackened his pace still more . Very slowly , more bent than when he came , lean , hungry , and disheartened , he made his way back to the station . The Buccaneer , watching him go so sadly home , felt sorry perhaps for his behaviour to the old man . CHAPTER V - SOAMES AND BOSINNEY CORRESPOND James said nothing to his son of this visit to the house ; but , having occasion to go to Timothy 's on morning on a matter connected with a drainage scheme which was being forced by the sanitary authorities on his brother , he mentioned it there . It was not , he said , a bad house . He could see that a good deal could be made of it . The fellow was clever in his way , though what it was going to cost Soames before it was done with he did n't know . Euphemia Forsyte , who happened to be in the room - she had come round to borrow the Rev. Mr. Scoles ' last novel , ' Passion and Paregoric ' , which was having such a vogue - chimed in . "
59997	60574	59985	59986	Mr. Bosinney	168	" It was thus , simply , that she recorded a scene which had really made a deep and complicated impression on her . She had been hurrying to the silk department of the Church and Commercial Stores - that Institution than which , with its admirable system , admitting only guaranteed persons on a basis of payment before delivery , no emporium can be more highly recommended to Forsytes - to match a piece of prunella silk for her mother , who was waiting in the carriage outside . Passing through the Groceries her eye was unpleasantly attracted by the back view of a very beautiful figure . It was so charmingly proportioned , so balanced , and so well clothed , that Euphemia 's instinctive propriety was at once alarmed ; such figures , she knew , by intuition rather than experience , were rarely connected with virtue - certainly never in her mind , for her own back was somewhat difficult to fit . Her suspicions were fortunately confirmed . A young man coming from the Drugs had snatched off his hat , and was accosting the lady with the unknown back . It was then that she saw with whom she had to deal ; the lady was undoubtedly Mrs. Soames , the young man Mr. Bosinney . Concealing herself rapidly over the purchase of a box of Tunisian dates , for she was impatient of awkwardly meeting people with parcels in her hands , and at the busy time of the morning , she was quite unintentionally an interested observer of their little interview . Mrs. Soames , usually somewhat pale , had a delightful colour in her cheeks ; and Mr. Bosinney 's manner was strange , though attractive she thought him rather a distinguished - looking man , and George 's name for him , ' The Buccaneer ' - about which there was something romantic - quite charming . He seemed to be pleading . Indeed , they talked so earnestly - or , rather , he talked so earnestly , for Mrs. Soames did not say much - that they caused , inconsiderately , an eddy in the traffic . One nice old General , going towards Cigars , was obliged to step quite out of the way , and chancing to look up and see Mrs. Soames ' face , he actually took off his hat , the old fool ! So like a man ! But it was Mrs. Soames ' eyes that worried Euphemia . She never once looked at Mr. Bosinney until he moved on , and then she looked after him . And , oh , that look ! On that look Euphemia had spent much anxious thought . It is not too much to say that it had hurt her with its dark , lingering softness , for all the world as though the woman wanted to drag him back , and unsay something she had been saying . Ah , well , she had had no time to go deeply into the matter just then , with that prunella silk on her hands ; but she was ' ve ry intriguee ' - very ! She had just nodded to Mrs. Soames , to show her that she had seen ; and , as she confided , in talking it over afterwards , to her chum Francie Roger 's daughter , "
60584	60610	60577	60577	she	1378	" James , most averse at the first blush to accepting any news confirmatory of his own poignant suspicions , took her up at once . "
60612	60616	60617	60617	they	1379	" he said , "
60627	60631	60617	60617	they	1379	" Euphemia smiled . "
60636	60655	60617	60617	they	1379	" she said softly ; and , taking ' Passion and Paregoric ' from the table , added : "
60671	60740	60664	60665	dear Auntie	1381	" and went away . James left almost immediately after ; he was late as it was . When he reached the office of Forsyte , Bustard and Forsyte , he found Soames , sitting in his revolving , chair , drawing up a defence . The latter greeted his father with a curt good - morning , and , taking an envelope from his pocket , said : "
60750	61041	60664	60665	dear Auntie	1381	" James read as follows : ' 309D , SLOANE STREET , May 15 , ' DEAR FORSYTE , ' The construction of your house being now completed , my duties as architect have come to an end . If I am to go on with the business of decoration , which at your request I undertook , I should like you to clearly understand that I must have a free hand . ' You never come down without suggesting something that goes counter to my scheme . I have here three letters from you , each of which recommends an article I should never dream of putting in . I had your father here yesterday afternoon , who made further valuable suggestions . ' Please make up your mind , therefore , whether you want me to decorate for you , or to retire which on the whole I should prefer to do . ' But understand that , if I decorate , I decorate alone , without interference of any sort . If I do the thing , I will do it thoroughly , but I must have a free hand . ' Yours truly , ' PHILIP BOSINNEY . ' The exact and immediate cause of this letter can not , of course , be told , though it is not improbable that Bosinney may have been moved by some sudden revolt against his position towards Soames - that eternal position of Art towards Property - which is so admirably summed up , on the back of the most indispensable of modern appliances , in a sentence comparable to the very finest in Tacitus : THOS . T. SORROW , Inventor . BERT M. PADLAND , Proprietor . "
61051	61063	61044	61044	you	1382	" James asked . Soames did not even turn his head . "
61072	61210	61069	61069	my	0	" he said , and went on with his defence . A client of his , having put some buildings on a piece of ground that did not belong to him , had been suddenly and most irritatingly warned to take them off again . After carefully going into the facts , however , Soames had seen his way to advise that his client had what was known as a title by possession , and that , though undoubtedly the ground did not belong to him , he was entitled to keep it , and had better do so ; and he was now following up this advice by taking steps to - as the sailors say - ' make it so . ' He had a distinct reputation for sound advice ; people saying of him : "
61222	62037	61216	61220	a long - headed fellow	1383	" and he prized this reputation highly . His natural taciturnity was in his favour ; nothing could be more calculated to give people , especially people with property Soames had no other clients , the impression that he was a safe man . And he was safe . Tradition , habit , education , inherited aptitude , native caution , all joined to form a solid professional honesty , superior to temptation - from the very fact that it was built on an innate avoidance of risk . How could he fall , when his soul abhorred circumstances which render a fall possible - a man can not fall off the floor ! And those countless Forsytes , who , in the course of innumerable transactions concerned with property of all sorts from wives to water rights , had occasion for the services of a safe man , found it both reposeful and profitable to confide in Soames . That slight superciliousness of his , combined with an air of mousing amongst precedents , was in his favour too - a man would not be supercilious unless he knew ! He was really at the head of the business , for though James still came nearly every day to , see for himself , he did little now but sit in his chair , twist his legs , slightly confuse things already decided , and presently go away again , and the other partner , Bustard , was a poor thing , who did a great deal of work , but whose opinion was never taken . So Soames went steadily on with his defence . Yet it would be idle to say that his mind was at ease . He was suffering from a sense of impending trouble , that had haunted him for some time past . He tried to think it physical - a condition of his liver - but knew that it was not . He looked at his watch . In a quarter of an hour he was due at the General Meeting of the New Colliery Company - one of Uncle Jolyon 's concerns ; he should see Uncle Jolyon there , and say something to him about Bosinney - he had not made up his mind what , but something - in any case he should not answer this letter until he had seen Uncle Jolyon . He got up and methodically put away the draft of his defence . Going into a dark little cupboard , he turned up the light , washed his hands with a piece of brown Windsor soap , and dried them on a roller towel . Then he brushed his hair , paying strict attention to the parting , turned down the light , took his hat , and saying he would be back at half - past two , stepped into the Poultry . It was not far to the Offices of the New Colliery Company in Ironmonger Lane , where , and not at the Cannon Street Hotel , in accordance with the more ambitious practice of other companies , the General Meeting was always held . Old Jolyon had from the first set his face against the Press . What business - he said - had the Public with his concerns ! Soames arrived on the stroke of time , and took his seat alongside the Board , who , in a row , each Director behind his own ink - pot , faced their Shareholders . In the centre of this row old Jolyon , conspicuous in his black , tightly - buttoned frock - coat and his white moustaches , was leaning back with finger tips crossed on a copy of the Directors ' report and accounts . On his right hand , always a little larger than life , sat the Secretary , ' Down - by - the - starn ' Hemmings ; an all - too - sad sadness beaming in his fine eyes ; his iron - grey beard , in mourning like the rest of him , giving the feeling of an all - too - black tie behind it . The occasion indeed was a melancholy one , only six weeks having elapsed since that telegram had come from Scorrier , the mining expert , on a private mission to the Mines , informing them that Pippin , their Superintendent , had committed suicide in endeavouring , after his extraordinary two years ' silence , to write a letter to his Board . That letter was on the table now ; it would be read to the Shareholders , who would of course be put into possession of all the facts . Hemmings had often said to Soames , standing with his coat - tails divided before the fireplace : "
62062	62087	62059	62060	Mr. Soames	171	" On one occasion , old Jolyon being present , Soames recollected a little unpleasantness . His uncle had looked up sharply and said : "
62107	62139	62095	62095	You	323	" Old Jolyon detested humbug . Hemmings , angry - eyed , and wearing a smile like that of a trained poodle , had replied in an outburst of artificial applause : "
62162	62180	62159	62159	his	994	" The next time he had seen Soames he had taken the opportunity of saying to him : "
62216	62876	62207	62207	you	730	" Soames had nodded . Everyone knew that Uncle Jolyon 's chin was a caution . He was looking worried to - day , in spite of his General Meeting look ; he Soames should certainly speak to him about Bosinney . Beyond old Jolyon on the left was little Mr. Booker , and he , too , wore his General Meeting look , as though searching for some particularly tender shareholder . And next him was the deaf director , with a frown ; and beyond the deaf director , again , was old Mr. Bleedham , very bland , and having an air of conscious virtue - as well he might , knowing that the brown - paper parcel he always brought to the Board - room was concealed behind his hat one of that old - fashioned class , of flat - brimmed top - hats which go with very large bow ties , clean - shaven lips , fresh cheeks , and neat little , white whiskers . Soames always attended the General Meeting ; it was considered better that he should do so , in case ' anything should arise ! ' He glanced round with his close , supercilious air at the walls of the room , where hung plans of the mine and harbour , together with a large photograph of a shaft leading to a working which had proved quite remarkably unprofitable . This photograph - a witness to the eternal irony underlying commercial enterprise till retained its position on the - wall , an effigy of the directors ' pet , but dead , lamb . And now old Jolyon rose , to present the report and accounts . Veiling under a Jove - like serenity that perpetual antagonism deep - seated in the bosom of a director towards his shareholders , he faced them calmly . Soames faced them too . He knew most of them by sight . There was old Scrubsole , a tar man , who always came , as Hemmings would say , ' to make himself nasty , ' a cantankerous - looking old fellow with a red face , a jowl , and an enormous low - crowned hat reposing on his knee . And the Rev. Mr. Boms , who always proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman , in which he invariably expressed the hope that the Board would not forget to elevate their employees , using the word with a double e , as being more vigorous and Anglo - Saxon he had the strong Imperialistic tendencies of his cloth . It was his salutary custom to buttonhole a director afterwards , and ask him whether he thought the coming year would be good or bad ; and , according to the trend of the answer , to buy or sell three shares within the ensuing fortnight . And there was that military man , Major O'Bally , who could not help speaking , if only to second the re - election of the auditor , and who sometimes caused serious consternation by taking toasts - proposals rather - out of the hands of persons who had been flattered with little slips of paper , entrusting the said proposals to their care . These made up the lot , together with four or five strong , silent shareholders , with whom Soames could sympathize - men of business , who liked to keep an eye on their affairs for themselves , without being fussy - good , solid men , who came to the City every day and went back in the evening to good , solid wives . Good , solid wives ! There was something in that thought which roused the nameless uneasiness in Soames again . What should he say to his uncle ? What answer should he make to this letter ? . . . . "
62894	62957	62886	62886	I	0	" A soft thump . Old Jolyon had let the report and accounts fall , and stood twisting his tortoise - shell glasses between thumb and forefinger . The ghost of a smile appeared on Soames ' face . They had better hurry up with their questions ! He well knew his uncle 's method the ideal one of at once saying : "
62971	63003	63004	63004	I	0	" Never let them get their wind - shareholders were notoriously wasteful of time ! A tall , white - bearded man , with a gaunt , dissatisfied face , arose : "
63033	63040	63011	63012	Mr. Chairman	330	" ' he looked sourly round , "
63114	63123	63112	63112	I	0	" Old Jolyon made a gesture of impatience . "
63174	63175	63131	63132	Mr. Chairman	1396	" "
63204	63205	63208	63208	sir	730	" "
63228	63242	63243	63243	I	0	" The shareholder sat down . Old Jolyon waited a second and said : "
63251	63257	63259	63259	I	0	" The shareholder rose again : "
63286	63318	63273	63273	I	0	" A second shareholder , with a round , dogged face , whom Soames recognised as the late superintendent 's brother - in - law , got up and said warmly : "
63331	63342	63273	63273	I	0	" The Rev. Mr. Boms now rose to his feet . "
63351	63355	63344	63344	I	0	" he said , "
63435	63450	63452	63452	he	1405	" he - looked severely at the late superintendent 's brother - in - law "
63536	63556	63558	63558	I	0	" The reverend gentleman resumed his seat . The late superintendent 's brother - in - law again rose : "
63565	63569	63558	63558	I	0	" he said ; "
63576	63583	63584	63584	I	0	" The first shareholder struck in : "
63620	63667	63608	63608	I	0	" All eyes were now turned upon Soames . Something had arisen ! He stood up , close - lipped and cold ; his nerves inwardly fluttered , his attention tweaked away at last from contemplation of that cloud looming on the horizon of his mind . "
63671	63681	63608	63608	I	0	" he said in a low , thin voice , "
63723	63741	63742	63742	We	1410	" The superintendent 's brother - in - law frowned , and said in a meaning tone : "
63779	63816	63773	63775	Mr. Soames Forsyte	171	" He looked from Soames to old Jolyon in a pointed manner . A flush coloured Soames ' pale cheeks , but his superciliousness did not waver . Old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the speaker . "
63819	63823	63773	63775	Mr. Soames Forsyte	171	" he said , "
63846	63874	63875	63875	I	0	" At this moment , however , there rose one of those five silent , stolid shareholders , who had excited Soames ' sympathy . He said : "
64006	64172	63985	63985	I	0	" Old Jolyon had remained standing while the strong , silent man was speaking . The speech awoke an echo in all hearts , voicing , as it did , the worship of strong men , the movement against generosity , which had at that time already commenced among the saner members of the community . The words ' it is not business ' had moved even the Board ; privately everyone felt that indeed it was not . But they knew also the chairman 's domineering temper and tenacity . He , too , at heart must feel that it was not business ; but he was committed to his own proposition . Would he go back upon it ? It was thought to be unlikely . All waited with interest . Old Jolyon held up his hand ; dark - rimmed glasses depending between his finger and thumb quivered slightly with a suggestion of menace . He addressed the strong , silent shareholder . "
64207	64208	64209	64209	I	0	" "
64212	64219	64209	64209	I	0	" Old Jolyon put the amendment . "
64225	64277	64278	64278	I	0	" he asked , looking calmly round . And it was then that Soames , looking at his uncle , felt the power of will that was in that old man . No one stirred . Looking straight into the eyes of the strong , silent shareholder , old Jolyon said : "
64325	64592	64298	64298	You	1421	" Soames smiled . Certainly Uncle Jolyon had a way with him ! But now his attention relapsed upon Bosinney . Odd how that fellow haunted his thoughts , even in business hours . Irene 's visit to the house - but there was nothing in that , except that she might have told him ; but then , again , she never did tell him anything . She was more silent , more touchy , every day . He wished to God the house were finished , and they were in it , away from London . Town did not suit her ; her nerves were not strong enough . That nonsense of the separate room had cropped up again ! The meeting was breaking up now . Underneath the photograph of the lost shaft Hemmings was buttonholed by the Rev. Mr. Boms . Little Mr. Booker , his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles , was having a parting turn - up with old Scrubsole . The two hated each other like poison . There was some matter of a tar - contract between them , little Mr. Booker having secured it from the Board for a nephew of his , over old Scrubsole 's head . Soames had heard that from Hemmings , who liked a gossip , more especially about his directors , except , indeed , old Jolyon , of whom he was afraid . Soames awaited his opportunity . The last shareholder was vanishing through the door , when he approached his uncle , who was putting on his hat . "
64605	65168	64602	64603	Uncle Jolyon	271	" It is uncertain what Soames expected to get out of this interview . Apart from that somewhat mysterious awe in which Forsytes in general held old Jolyon , due to his philosophic twist , or perhaps - as Hemmings would doubtless have said - to his chin , there was , and always had been , a subtle antagonism between the younger man and the old . It had lurked under their dry manner of greeting , under their non - committal allusions to each other , and arose perhaps from old Jolyon 's perception of the quiet tenacity ' obstinacy , ' he rather naturally called it of the young man , of a secret doubt whether he could get his own way with him . Both these Forsytes , wide asunder as the poles in many respects , possessed in their different ways - to a greater degree than the rest of the family - that essential quality of tenacious and prudent insight into ' affairs , ' which is the highwater mark of their great class . Either of them , with a little luck and opportunity , was equal to a lofty career ; either of them would have made a good financier , a great contractor , a statesman , though old Jolyon , in certain of his moods when under the influence of a cigar or of Nature - would have been capable of , not perhaps despising , but certainly of questioning , his own high position , while Soames , who never smoked cigars , would not . Then , too , in old Jolyon 's mind there was always the secret ache , that the son of James - of James , whom he had always thought such a poor thing , should be pursuing the paths of success , while his own son ... ! And last , not least - for he was no more outside the radiation of family gossip than any other Forsyte - he had now heard the sinister , indefinite , but none the less disturbing rumour about Bosinney , and his pride was wounded to the quick . Characteristically , his irritation turned not against Irene but against Soames . The idea that his nephew 's wife why could n't the fellow take better care of her - Oh ! quaint injustice ! as though Soames could possibly take more care ! - should be drawing to herself June 's lover , was intolerably humiliating . And seeing the danger , he did not , like James , hide it away in sheer nervousness , but owned with the dispassion of his broader outlook , that it was not unlikely ; there was something very attractive about Irene ! He had a presentiment on the subject of Soames ' communication as they left the Board Room together , and went out into the noise and hurry of Cheapside . They walked together a good minute without speaking , Soames with his mousing , mincing step , and old Jolyon upright and using his umbrella languidly as a walking - stick . They turned presently into comparative quiet , for old Jolyon 's way to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage Street . Then Soames , without lifting his eyes , began : "
65213	65224	65226	65226	he	316	" Old Jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter : "
65232	65236	65237	65237	He	316	" he said . "
65246	65282	65237	65237	He	316	" replied Soames . Old Jolyon looked at him . The long - suppressed irritation and antagonism towards this young fellow , whose affairs were beginning to intrude upon his own , burst from him . "
65298	65305	65294	65294	you	1429	" Soames stole a sideway look : "
65316	65320	65294	65294	you	1429	" he said , "
65361	65362	65345	65345	I	0	" "
65365	65371	65345	65345	I	0	" said old Jolyon abruptly ; "
65381	65415	65372	65372	I	0	" The words of both uncle and nephew gave the impression of unspoken meanings , far more important , behind . And the look they interchanged was like a revelation of this consciousness . "
65418	65422	65372	65372	I	0	" said Soames ; "
65453	65454	65446	65446	I	0	" "
65461	65468	65446	65446	I	0	" old Jolyon took him up . "
65476	65493	65471	65471	I	0	" said Soames , and flurried by that sharp look he was unable to say more . "
65503	65512	65497	65497	I	0	" he added sulkily , recovering his composure . "
65516	65521	65522	65522	I	0	" said old Jolyon ; "
65556	65557	65527	65527	you	1429	" "
65561	65566	65567	65567	I	0	" said Soames immovably , "
65570	65571	65567	65567	I	0	" "
65578	65768	65567	65567	I	0	" said old Jolyon , and they parted . Soames retraced his steps , and going into a celebrated eating - house , asked for a plate of smoked salmon and a glass of Chablis ; he seldom ate much in the middle of the day , and generally ate standing , finding the position beneficial to his liver , which was very sound , but to which he desired to put down all his troubles . When he had finished he went slowly back to his office , with bent head , taking no notice of the swarming thousands on the pavements , who in their turn took no notice of him . The evening post carried the following reply to Bosinney : ' FORSYTE , BUSTARD AND FORSYTE , ' Commissioners for Oaths , ' 92001 , BRANCH LANE , POULTRY , E.C. , ' May 17 , 1887 . ' DEAR BOSINNEY , ' I have , received your letter , the terms of which not a little surprise me . I was under the impression that you had , and have had all along , a "
65771	65806	65567	65567	I	0	" ; for I do not recollect that any suggestions I have been so unfortunate as to make have met with your approval . In giving you , in accordance with your request , this "
65810	66105	65567	65567	I	0	" I wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me completely decorated , inclusive of your fee as arranged between us , must not exceed twelve thousand pounds - L12,000 . This gives you an ample margin , and , as you know , is far more than I originally contemplated . ' I am , ' Yours truly , ' SOAMES FORSYTE . ' On the following day he received a note from Bosinney : ' PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY , ' Architect , ' 309D , SLOANE STREET , S.W. , ' May 18 . ' DEAR FORSYTE , ' If you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration I can bind myself to the exact pound , I am afraid you are mistaken . I can see that you are tired of the arrangement , and of me , and I had better , therefore , resign . ' Yours faithfully , ' PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY . ' Soames pondered long and painfully over his answer , and late at night in the dining - room , when Irene had gone to bed , he composed the following : ' 62 , MONTPELLIER SQUARE , S.W. , ' May 19 , 1887 . ' DEAR BOSINNEY , ' I think that in both our interests it would be extremely undesirable that matters should be so left at this stage . I did not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds , there would be any difficulty between us . This being so , I should like you to reconsider your answer . You have a "
66108	66790	65567	65567	I	0	" in the terms of this correspondence , and I hope you will see your way to completing the decorations , in the matter of which I know it is difficult to be absolutely exact . ' Yours truly , ' SOAMES FORSYTE . ' Bosinney 's answer , which came in the course of the next day , was : ' May 20 . ' DEAR FORSYTE , ' Very well . ' PH . BOSINNEY . ' CHAPTER VI - OLD JOLYON AT THE ZOO Old Jolyon disposed of his second Meeting - an ordinary Board - summarily . He was so dictatorial that his fellow directors were left in cabal over the increasing domineeringness of old Forsyte , which they were far from intending to stand much longer , they said . He went out by Underground to Portland Road Station , whence he took a cab and drove to the Zoo . He had an assignation there , one of those assignations that had lately been growing more frequent , to which his increasing uneasiness about June and the ' change in her , ' as he expressed it , was driving him . She buried herself away , and was growing thin ; if he spoke to her he got no answer , or had his head snapped off , or she looked as if she would burst into tears . She was as changed as she could be , all through this Bosinney . As for telling him about anything , not a bit of it ! And he would sit for long spells brooding , his paper unread before him , a cigar extinct between his lips . She had been such a companion to him ever since she was three years old ! And he loved her so ! Forces regardless of family or class or custom were beating down his guard ; impending events over which he had no control threw their shadows on his head . The irritation of one accustomed to have his way was roused against he knew not what . Chafing at the slowness of his cab , he reached the Zoo door ; but , with his sunny instinct for seizing the good of each moment , he forgot his vexation as he walked towards the tryst . From the stone terrace above the bear - pit his son and his two grandchildren came hastening down when they saw old Jolyon coming , and led him away towards the lion - house . They supported him on either side , holding one to each of his hands , - whilst Jolly , perverse like his father , carried his grandfather 's umbrella in such a way as to catch people 's legs with the crutch of the handle . Young Jolyon followed . It was as good as a play to see his father with the children , but such a play as brings smiles with tears behind . An old man and two small children walking together can be seen at any hour of the day ; but the sight of old Jolyon , with Jolly and Holly seemed to young Jolyon a special peep - show of the things that lie at the bottom of our hearts . The complete surrender of that erect old figure to those little figures on either hand was too poignantly tender , and , being a man of an habitual reflex action , young Jolyon swore softly under his breath . The show affected him in a way unbecoming to a Forsyte , who is nothing if not undemonstrative . Thus they reached the lion - house . There had been a morning fete at the Botanical Gardens , and a large number of Forsy ... ' - that is , of well - dressed people who kept carriages had brought them on to the Zoo , so as to have more , if possible , for their money , before going back to Rutland Gate or Bryanston Square . "
66799	66807	65567	65567	I	0	" they had said to each other ; "
66814	66914	65567	65567	I	0	" It was a shilling day ; and there would not be all those horrid common people . In front of the long line of cages they were collected in rows , watching the tawny , ravenous beasts behind the bars await their only pleasure of the four - and - twenty hours . The hungrier the beast , the greater the fascination . But whether because the spectators envied his appetite , or , more humanely , because it was so soon to be satisfied , young Jolyon could not tell . Remarks kept falling on his ears : "
66926	66927	65567	65567	I	0	" "
66940	66941	66944	66944	he	1432	" "
66957	67013	66955	66955	mother	1433	" And frequently , with little pats , one or another would clap their hands to their pockets behind and look round , as though expecting young Jolyon or some disinterested - looking person to relieve them of the contents . A well - fed man in a white waistcoat said slowly through his teeth : "
67032	67068	67027	67027	they	1434	" At these words a tiger snatched a piece of bleeding liver , and the fat man laughed . His wife , in a Paris model frock and gold nose - nippers , reproved him : "
67081	67445	67446	67446	I	0	" Young Jolyon frowned . The circumstances of his life , though he had ceased to take a too personal view of them , had left him subject to an intermittent contempt ; and the class to which he had belonged - the carriage class - especially excited his sarcasm . To shut up a lion or tiger in confinement was surely a horrible barbarity . But no cultivated person would admit this . The idea of its being barbarous to confine wild animals had probably never even occurred to his father for instance ; he belonged to the old school , who considered it at once humanizing and educational to confine baboons and panthers , holding the view , no doubt , that in course of time they might induce these creatures not so unreasonably to die of misery and heart - sickness against the bars of their cages , and put the society to the expense of getting others ! In his eyes , as in the eyes of all Forsytes , the pleasure of seeing these beautiful creatures in a state of captivity far outweighed the inconvenience of imprisonment to beasts whom God had so improvidently placed in a state of freedom ! It was for the animals good , removing them at once from the countless dangers of open air and exercise , and enabling them to exercise their functions in the guaranteed seclusion of a private compartment ! Indeed , it was doubtful what wild animals were made for but to be shut up in cages ! But as young Jolyon had in his constitution the elements of impartiality , he reflected that to stigmatize as barbarity that which was merely lack of imagination must be wrong ; for none who held these views had been placed in a similar position to the animals they caged , and could not , therefore , be expected to enter into their sensations . It was not until they were leaving the gardens - Jolly and Holly in a state of blissful delirium - that old Jolyon found an opportunity of speaking to his son on the matter next his heart . "
67456	67460	67446	67446	I	0	" he said ; "
67538	67568	67526	67526	she	1436	" Young Jolyon smiled ; his eyes had wandered to his father 's chin . ' A pair of you , ' he thought , but he said nothing . "
67572	67578	67582	67582	Bosinney	332	" went on old Jolyon , "
67613	67618	67609	67609	you	1438	" he added doubtfully . "
67642	67682	67635	67635	they	1442	" Old Jolyon looked at his son . Now they had actually come to discuss a subject connected with the relations between the sexes he felt distrustful . Jo would be sure to hold some loose view or other . "
67693	67697	67690	67690	you	1438	" he said ; "
67733	67859	67727	67727	I	0	" He dropped the subject . It was impossible to discuss with his son the true nature and meaning of Bosinney 's defection . Had not his son done the very same thing worse , if possible fifteen years ago ? There seemed no end to the consequences of that piece of folly . Young Jolyon also was silent ; he had quickly penetrated his father 's thought , for , dethroned from the high seat of an obvious and uncomplicated view of things , he had become both perceptive and subtle . The attitude he had adopted towards sexual matters fifteen years before , however , was too different from his father 's . There was no bridging the gulf . He said coolly : "
67872	67881	67882	67882	I	0	" Old Jolyon gave him a dubious look : "
67887	67891	67892	67892	they	1444	" he said ; "
67896	67897	67892	67892	they	1444	" "
67905	67911	67892	67892	they	1444	" remarked young Jolyon unexpectedly ; "
67923	67924	67915	67915	they	1444	" "
67927	67932	67915	67915	they	1444	" said old Jolyon , "
67937	67989	67990	67990	She	1443	" Young Jolyon did not whistle : The circumstances of his own life had rendered him incapable of whistling on such a subject , but he looked at his father , while the ghost of a smile hovered over his face . If old Jolyon saw , he took no notice . "
67997	68001	67990	67990	She	1443	" he muttered . "
68006	68032	68004	68004	June	166	" said young Jolyon softly . He thought of his daughter still as a babe of three . Old Jolyon came to a sudden halt . "
68042	68046	68033	68033	I	0	" he said , "
68068	68651	68652	68653	Uncle James	241	" They stood at a corner to see if an empty cab would come along , while carriage after carriage drove past , bearing Forsytes of all descriptions from the Zoo . The harness , the liveries , the gloss on the horses ' coats , shone and glittered in the May sunlight , and each equipage , landau , sociable , barouche , Victoria , or brougham , seemed to roll out proudly from its wheels : ' I and my horses and my men you know , ' Indeed the whole turn - out have cost a pot . But we were worth it every penny . Look At Master and at Missis now , the dawgs ! Ease with security - ah ! that 's the ticket ! And such , as everyone knows , is fit accompaniment for a perambulating Forsyte . Amongst these carriages was a barouche coming at a greater pace than the others , drawn by a pair of bright bay horses . It swung on its high springs , and the four people who filled it seemed rocked as in a cradle . This chariot attracted young Jolyon 's attention ; and suddenly , on the back seat , he recognised his Uncle James , unmistakable in spite of the increased whiteness of his whiskers ; opposite , their backs defended by sunshades , Rachel Forsyte and her elder but married sister , Winifred Dartie , in irreproachable toilettes , had posed their heads haughtily , like two of the birds they had been seeing at the Zoo ; while by James ' side reclined Dartie , in a brand - new frock - coat buttoned tight and square , with a large expanse of carefully shot linen protruding below each wristband . An extra , if subdued , sparkle , an added touch of the best gloss or varnish characterized this vehicle , and seemed to distinguish it from all the others , as though by some happy extravagance - like that which marks out the real ' work of art ' from the ordinary ' picture ' - it were designated as the typical car , the very throne of Forsytedom . Old Jolyon did not see them pass ; he was petting poor Holly who was tired , but those in the carriage had taken in the little group ; the ladies ' heads tilted suddenly , there was a spasmodic screening movement of parasols ; James ' face protruded naively , like the head of a long bird , his mouth slowly opening . The shield - like rounds of the parasols grew smaller and smaller , and vanished . Young Jolyon saw that he had been recognised , even by Winifred , who could not have been more than fifteen when he had forfeited the right to be considered a Forsyte . There was not much change in them ! He remembered the exact look of their turn - out all that time ago : Horses , men , carriage - all different now , no doubt - but of the precise stamp of fifteen years before ; the same neat display , the same nicely calculated arrogance ease with security ! The swing exact , the pose of the sunshades exact , exact the spirit of the whole thing . And in the sunlight , defended by the haughty shields of parasols , carriage after carriage went by . "
68663	68673	68652	68653	Uncle James	241	" said young Jolyon . His father looked black . "
68695	68711	68686	68686	he	994	" An empty cab drove up at this moment , and old Jolyon stopped it . "
68723	68727	68686	68686	he	994	" he said . "
68754	69875	68745	68745	I	0	" Kissing the children , who tried to detain him , he stepped in and was borne away . Young Jolyon , who had taken Holly up in his arms , stood motionless at the corner , looking after the cab . CHAPTER VII - AFTERNOON AT TIMOTHY 'S If old Jolyon , as he got into his cab , had said : ' I wo n't believe a word of it ! ' he would more truthfully have expressed his sentiments . The notion that James and his womankind had seen him in the company of his son had awakened in him not only the impatience he always felt when crossed , but that secret hostility natural between brothers , the roots of which - little nursery rivalries - sometimes toughen and deepen as life goes on , and , all hidden , support a plant capable of producing in season the bitterest fruits . Hitherto there had been between these six brothers no more unfriendly feeling than that caused by the secret and natural doubt that the others might be richer than themselves ; a feeling increased to the pitch of curiosity by the approach of death - that end of all handicaps - and the great ' closeness ' of their man of business , who , with some sagacity , would profess to Nicholas ignorance of James ' income , to James ignorance of old Jolyon 's , to Jolyon ignorance of Roger 's , to Roger ignorance of Swithin 's , while to Swithin he would say most irritatingly that Nicholas must be a rich man . Timothy alone was exempt , being in gilt - edged securities . But now , between two of them at least , had arisen a very different sense of injury . From the moment when James had the impertinence to pry into his affairs - as he put it - old Jolyon no longer chose to credit this story about Bosinney . His grand - daughter slighted through a member of ' that fellow 's ' family ! He made up his mind that Bosinney was maligned . There must be some other reason for his defection . June had flown out at him , or something ; she was as touchy as she could be ! He would , however , let Timothy have a bit of his mind , and see if he would go on dropping hints ! And he would not let the grass grow under his feet either , he would go there at once , and take very good care that he did n't have to go again on the same errand . He saw James ' carriage blocking the pavement in front of ' The Bower . ' So they had got there before him - cackling about having seen him , he dared say ! And further on , Swithin 's greys were turning their noses towards the noses of James ' bays , as though in conclave over the family , while their coachmen were in conclave above . Old Jolyon , depositing his hat on the chair in the narrow hall , where that hat of Bosinney 's had so long ago been mistaken for a cat , passed his thin hand grimly over his face with its great drooping white moustaches , as though to remove all traces of expression , and made his way upstairs . He found the front drawing - room full . It was full enough at the best of times - without visitors - without any one in it - for Timothy and his sisters , following the tradition of their generation , considered that a room was not quite ' nice ' unless it was ' properly ' furnished . It held , therefore , eleven chairs , a sofa , three tables , two cabinets , innumerable knicknacks , and part of a large grand piano . And now , occupied by Mrs. Small , Aunt Hester , by Swithin , James , Rachel , Winifred , Euphemia , who had come in again to return ' Passion and Paregoric ' which she had read at lunch , and her chum Frances , Roger 's daughter the musical Forsyte , the one who composed songs , there was only one chair left unoccupied , except , of course , the two that nobody ever sat on - and the only standing room was occupied by the cat , on whom old Jolyon promptly stepped . In these days it was by no means unusual for Timothy to have so many visitors . The family had always , one and all , had a real respect for Aunt Ann , and now that she was gone , they were coming far more frequently to The Bower , and staying longer . Swithin had been the first to arrive , and seated torpid in a red satin chair with a gilt back , he gave every appearance of lasting the others out . And symbolizing Bosinney 's name ' the big one , ' with his great stature and bulk , his thick white hair , his puffy immovable shaven face , he looked more primeval than ever in the highly upholstered room . His conversation , as usual of late , had turned at once upon Irene , and he had lost no time in giving Aunts Juley and Hester his opinion with regard to this rumour he heard was going about . No - as he said - she might want a bit of flirtation - a pretty woman must have her fling ; but more than that he did not believe . Nothing open ; she had too much good sense , too much proper appreciation of what was due to her position , and to the family ! No sc - , he was going to say ' scandal ' but the very idea was so preposterous that he waved his hand as though to say - ' but let that pass ! ' Granted that Swithin took a bachelor 's view of the situation - still what indeed was not due to that family in which so many had done so well for themselves , had attained a certain position ? If he had heard in dark , pessimistic moments the words ' yeomen ' and ' ve ry small beer ' used in connection with his origin , did he believe them ? No ! he cherished , hugging it pathetically to his bosom the secret theory that there was something distinguished somewhere in his ancestry . "
69879	69895	68745	68745	I	0	" he once said to young Jolyon , before the latter went to the bad . "
69914	70453	68745	68745	I	0	" He had been fond of young Jolyon : the boy had been in a good set at College , had known that old ruffian Sir Charles Fiste 's sons - a pretty rascal one of them had turned out , too ; and there was style about him - it was a thousand pities he had run off with that half - foreign governess ! If he must go off like that why could n't he have chosen someone who would have done them credit ! And what was he now ? - an underwriter at Lloyd 's ; they said he even painted pictures - pictures ! Damme ! he might have ended as Sir Jolyon Forsyte , Bart . , with a seat in Parliament , and a place in the country ! It was Swithin who , following the impulse which sooner or later urges thereto some member of every great family , went to the Heralds ' Office , where they assured him that he was undoubtedly of the same family as the well - known Forsites with an ' i , ' whose arms were ' three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules , ' hoping no doubt to get him to take them up . Swithin , however , did not do this , but having ascertained that the crest was a ' pheasant proper , ' and the motto ' For Forsite , ' he had the pheasant proper placed upon his carriage and the buttons of his coachman , and both crest and motto on his writing - paper . The arms he hugged to himself , partly because , not having paid for them , he thought it would look ostentatious to put them on his carriage , and he hated ostentation , and partly because he , like any practical man all over the country , had a secret dislike and contempt for things he could not understand he found it hard , as anyone might , to swallow ' three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules . ' He never forgot , however , their having told him that if he paid for them he would be entitled to use them , and it strengthened his conviction that he was a gentleman . Imperceptibly the rest of the family absorbed the ' pheasant proper , ' and some , more serious than others , adopted the motto ; old Jolyon , however , refused to use the latter , saying that it was humbug meaning nothing , so far as he could see . Among the older generation it was perhaps known at bottom from what great historical event they derived their crest ; and if pressed on the subject , sooner than tell a lie - they did not like telling lies , having an impression that only Frenchmen and Russians told them - they would confess hurriedly that Swithin had got hold of it somehow . Among the younger generation the matter was wrapped in a discretion proper . They did not want to hurt the feelings of their elders , nor to feel ridiculous themselves ; they simply used the crest .... "
70456	70460	70461	70461	he	1456	" said Swithin , "
70512	71181	70483	70483	her	1457	" But here the entrance of Frances and Euphemia put an unfortunate stop to the conversation , for this was not a subject which could be discussed before young people . And though Swithin was somewhat upset at being stopped like this on the point of saying something important , he soon recovered his affability . He was rather fond of Frances - Francie , as she was called in the family . She was so smart , and they told him she made a pretty little pot of pin - money by her songs ; he called it very clever of her . He rather prided himself indeed on a liberal attitude towards women , not seeing any reason why they should n't paint pictures , or write tunes , or books even , for the matter of that , especially if they could turn a useful penny by it ; not at all - kept them out of mischief . It was not as if they were men ! ' Little Francie , ' as she was usually called with good - natured contempt , was an important personage , if only as a standing illustration of the attitude of Forsytes towards the Arts . She was not really ' little , ' but rather tall , with dark hair for a Forsyte , which , together with a grey eye , gave her what was called ' a Celtic appearance . ' She wrote songs with titles like ' Breathing Sighs , ' or ' Kiss me , Mother , ere I die , ' with a refrain like an anthem : ' Kiss me , Mother , ere I die ; Kiss me - kiss me , Mother , ah ! Kiss , ah ! kiss me e - ere I - Kiss me , Mother , ere I d - d - die ! ' She wrote the words to them herself , and other poems . In lighter moments she wrote waltzes , one of which , the ' Kensington Coil , ' was almost national to Kensington , having a sweet dip in it . It was very original . Then there were her ' Songs for Little People , ' at once educational and witty , especially ' Gran'ma 's Porgie , ' and that ditty , almost prophetically imbued with the coming Imperial spirit , entitled ' Black Him In His Little Eye . ' Any publisher would take these , and reviews like ' High Living , ' and the ' Ladies ' Genteel Guide ' went into raptures over : ' Another of Miss Francie Forsyte 's spirited ditties , sparkling and pathetic . We ourselves were moved to tears and laughter . Miss Forsyte should go far . ' With the true instinct of her breed , Francie had made a point of knowing the right people - people who would write about her , and talk about her , and people in Society , too - keeping a mental register of just where to exert her fascinations , and an eye on that steady scale of rising prices , which in her mind 's eye represented the future . In this way she caused herself to be universally respected . Once , at a time when her emotions were whipped by an attachment - for the tenor of Roger 's life , with its whole - hearted collection of house property , had induced in his only daughter a tendency towards passion - she turned to great and sincere work , choosing the sonata form , for the violin . This was the only one of her productions that troubled the Forsytes . They felt at once that it would not sell . Roger , who liked having a clever daughter well enough , and often alluded to the amount of pocket - money she made for herself , was upset by this violin sonata . "
71186	71458	70483	70483	her	1457	" he called it . Francie had borrowed young Flageoletti from Euphemia , to play it in the drawing - room at Prince 's Gardens . As a matter of fact Roger was right . It was rubbish , but - annoying ! the sort of rubbish that would n't sell . As every Forsyte knows , rubbish that sells is not rubbish at all - far from it . And yet , in spite of the sound common sense which fixed the worth of art at what it would fetch , some of the Forsytes - Aunt Hester , for instance , who had always been musical - could not help regretting that Francie 's music was not ' classical ' ; the same with her poems . But then , as Aunt Hester said , they did n't see any poetry nowadays , all the poems were ' little light things . ' There was nobody who could write a poem like ' Paradise Lost , ' or ' Childe Harold ' ; either of which made you feel that you really had read something . Still , it was nice for Francie to have something to occupy her ; while other girls were spending money shopping she was making it ! And both Aunt Hester and Aunt Juley were always ready to listen to the latest story of how Francie had got her price increased . They listened now , together with Swithin , who sat pretending not to , for these young people talked so fast and mumbled so , he never could catch what they said . "
71465	71470	71460	71460	I	0	" said Mrs. Septimus , "
71483	71488	71489	71489	I	0	" Francie smiled lightly . "
71506	71507	71501	71501	Women	817	" "
71511	71516	71501	71501	Women	817	" cried Mrs. Small , "
71524	71547	71517	71517	I	0	" Euphemia went off into her silent laugh , and , ending with the squeak , said , as though being strangled : "
71559	71648	71550	71550	you	2282	" Swithin saw no necessity to laugh ; he detested people laughing when he himself perceived no joke . Indeed , he detested Euphemia altogether , to whom he always alluded as ' Nick 's daughter , what 's she called - the pale one ? ' He had just missed being her god - father - indeed , would have been , had he not taken a firm stand against her outlandish name . He hated becoming a godfather . Swithin then said to Francie with dignity : "
71663	71705	71550	71550	you	2282	" But Euphemia , who knew perfectly well that he had refused to be her godfather , turned to Aunt Hester , and began telling her how she had seen Irene - Mrs. Soames - at the Church and Commercial Stores . "
71712	71732	71707	71707	Soames	177	" said Aunt Hester , to whom Mrs. Small had as yet had no opportunity of relating the incident . "
71741	71742	71733	71733	Soames	177	" "
71751	71752	71733	71733	Soames	177	" "
71769	71809	71764	71764	She	1466	" But Swithin , hearing the name Irene , looked severely at Euphemia , who , it is true , never did look well in a dress , whatever she may have done on other occasions , and said : "
71828	72690	71826	71826	her	1466	" At this moment James and his daughters were announced . Dartie , feeling badly in want of a drink , had pleaded an appointment with his dentist , and , being put down at the Marble Arch , had got into a hansom , and was already seated in the window of his club in Piccadilly . His wife , he told his cronies , had wanted to take him to pay some calls . It was not in his line - not exactly . Haw ! Hailing the waiter , he sent him out to the hall to see what had won the 4.30 race . He was dog - tired , he said , and that was a fact ; had been drivin ' about with his wife to ' shows ' all the afternoon . Had put his foot down at last . A fellow must live his own life . At this moment , glancing out of the bay window - for he loved this seat whence he could see everybody pass - his eye unfortunately , or perhaps fortunately , chanced to light on the figure of Soames , who was mousing across the road from the Green Park - side , with the evident intention of coming in , for he , too , belonged to ' The Iseeum . ' Dartie sprang to his feet ; grasping his glass , he muttered something about ' that 4.30 race , ' and swiftly withdrew to the card - room , where Soames never came . Here , in complete isolation and a dim light , he lived his own life till half past seven , by which hour he knew Soames must certainly have left the club . It would not do , as he kept repeating to himself whenever he felt the impulse to join the gossips in the bay - window getting too strong for him - it absolutely would not do , with finances as low as his , and the ' old man ' James rusty ever since that business over the oil shares , which was no fault of his , to risk a row with Winifred . If Soames were to see him in the club it would be sure to come round to her that he was n't at the dentist 's at all . He never knew a family where things ' came round ' so . Uneasily , amongst the green baize card - tables , a frown on his olive coloured face , his check trousers crossed , and patent - leather boots shining through the gloom , he sat biting his forefinger , and wondering where the deuce he was to get the money if Erotic failed to win the Lancashire Cup . His thoughts turned gloomily to the Forsytes . What a set they were ! There was no getting anything out of them - at least , it was a matter of extreme difficulty . They were so d - -d particular about money matters ; not a sportsman amongst the lot , unless it were George . That fellow Soames , for instance , would have a ft if you tried to borrow a tenner from him , or , if he did n't have a fit , he looked at you with his cursed supercilious smile , as if you were a lost soul because you were in want of money . And that wife of his Dartie 's mouth watered involuntarily , he had tried to be on good terms with her , as one naturally would with any pretty sister - in - law , but he would be cursed if the he mentally used a coarse word - would have anything to say to him - she looked at him , indeed , as if he were dirt - and yet she could go far enough , he would n't mind betting . He knew women ; they were n't made with soft eyes and figures like that for nothing , as that fellow Soames would jolly soon find out , if there were anything in what he had heard about this Buccaneer Johnny . Rising from his chair , Dartie took a turn across the room , ending in front of the looking - glass over the marble chimney - piece ; and there he stood for a long time contemplating in the glass the reflection of his face . It had that look , peculiar to some men , of having been steeped in linseed oil , with its waxed dark moustaches and the little distinguished commencements of side whiskers ; and concernedly he felt the promise of a pimple on the side of his slightly curved and fattish nose . In the meantime old Jolyon had found the remaining chair in Timothy 's commodious drawing - room . His advent had obviously put a stop to the conversation , decided awkwardness having set in . Aunt Juley , with her well - known kindheartedness , hastened to set people at their ease again . "
72695	72699	72693	72693	Jolyon	165	" she said , "
72740	72741	72743	72743	he	316	" "
72745	72755	72743	72743	he	316	" said old Jolyon , looking hard at James . "
72770	72811	72743	72743	he	316	" James , brooding in a small chair from which his knees ran uphill , shifted his feet uneasily , and put one of them down on the cat , which had unwisely taken refuge from old Jolyon beside him . "
72821	72845	72814	72814	you	165	" he said in an injured voice , withdrawing his foot nervously as he felt it squeezing into the soft , furry body . "
72848	72860	72861	72861	I	0	" said old Jolyon , looking at one face and another ; "
72868	72891	72861	72861	I	0	" A silence followed . Then Mrs. Small , twisting her fingers and gazing round with ' pathetic calm ' , asked : "
72898	72930	72895	72896	dear June	166	" A twinkle of humour shot through the sternness of old Jolyon 's eyes . Extraordinary old woman , Juley ! No one quite like her for saying the wrong thing ! "
72933	72937	72943	72943	her	166	" he said ; "
72958	73123	73124	73124	You	1472	" He laid emphasis on the words , and again looked James in the face . Nobody spoke . A feeling of its being too dangerous to take a step in any direction , or hazard any remark , had fallen on them all . Something of the sense of the impending , that comes over the spectator of a Greek tragedy , had entered that upholstered room , filled with those white - haired , frock - coated old men , and fashionably attired women , who were all of the same blood , between all of whom existed an unseizable resemblance . Not that they were conscious of it - the visits of such fateful , bitter spirits are only felt . Then Swithin rose . He would not sit there , feeling like that - he was not to be put down by anyone ! And , manoeuvring round the room with added pomp , he shook hands with each separately . "
73130	73134	73124	73124	You	1472	" he said , "
73142	73159	73160	73160	You	1472	" Then , turning to Francie , whom he considered ' smart , ' he added : "
73172	73239	73160	73160	You	1472	" But this conjured up the vision of that other eventful drive which had been so much talked about , and he stood quite still for a second , with glassy eyes , as though waiting to catch up with the significance of what he himself had said ; then , suddenly recollecting that he did n't care a damn , he turned to old Jolyon : "
73265	73365	73366	73366	I	0	" And , kicking the cat slightly with the pointed tip of his patent leather boot , he took his huge form away . When he had gone everyone looked secretly at the others , to see how they had taken the mention of the word ' drive ' - the word which had become famous , and acquired an overwhelming importance , as the only official - so to speak - news in connection with the vague and sinister rumour clinging to the family tongue . Euphemia , yielding to an impulse , said with a short laugh : "
73380	73400	73404	73404	he	233	" Mrs. Small , to reassure her and smooth over any little awkwardness the subject might have , replied : "
73435	73499	73500	73500	He	233	" And her chubby round old face was spread for a moment with a strange contentment ; then broke into pouts , and tears came into her eyes . She was thinking of that long ago driving tour she had once taken with Septimus Small . James , who had relapsed into his nervous brooding in the little chair , suddenly roused himself : "
73508	73673	73500	73500	He	233	" he said , but in a half - hearted way . Old Jolyon 's silence , his stern eyes , held them all in a kind of paralysis . He was disconcerted himself by the effect of his own words - an effect which seemed to deepen the importance of the very rumour he had come to scotch ; but he was still angry . He had not done with them yet - No , no - he would give them another rub or two . He did not wish to rub his nieces , he had no quarrel with them - a young and presentable female always appealed to old Jolyon 's clemency - but that fellow James , and , in a less degree perhaps , those others , deserved all they would get . And he , too , asked for Timothy . As though feeling that some danger threatened her younger brother , Aunt Juley suddenly offered him tea : "
73678	73682	73500	73500	He	233	" she said , "
73705	73710	73698	73698	Smither	259	" Old Jolyon rose : "
73714	73723	73712	73712	you	1478	" he said , looking straight at James , "
73768	73987	73766	73766	Winifred	187	" Without more ceremonious adieux , he marched out . Once again in his cab , his anger evaporated , for so it ever was with his wrath - when he had rapped out , it was gone . Sadness came over his spirit . He had stopped their mouths , maybe , but at what a cost ! At the cost of certain knowledge that the rumour he had been resolved not to believe was true . June was abandoned , and for the wife of that fellow 's son ! He felt it was true , and hardened himself to treat it as if it were not ; but the pain he hid beneath this resolution began slowly , surely , to vent itself in a blind resentment against James and his son . The six women and one man left behind in the little drawing - room began talking as easily as might be after such an occurrence , for though each one of them knew for a fact that he or she never talked scandal , each one of them also knew that the other six did ; all were therefore angry and at a loss . James only was silent , disturbed , to the bottom of his soul . Presently Francie said : "
74011	74021	74005	74005	you	1480	" Aunt Hester made a little movement of recoil : "
74029	74033	74027	74027	Julia	176	" she said ; "
74040	74057	74027	74027	Julia	176	" No one else was afraid of assenting , and James muttered gloomily at the floor : "
74067	74068	74069	74069	I	0	" "
74077	74082	74083	74083	he	271	" went on Francie ; "
74088	74106	74083	74083	he	271	" Aunt Juley shook her head ; her face seemed suddenly to have become one immense pout . "
74111	74125	74083	74083	he	271	" she said , ' somebody ought to see to it for him ! "
74239	74242	74243	74243	she	177	" Hester ! "
74246	74249	74243	74243	she	177	" Hester ! "
74257	74260	74262	74263	Aunt Juley	237	" Hester , "
74275	74287	74262	74263	Aunt Juley	237	" I am quite troubled about poor dear Jolyon . What , "
74295	74304	74288	74289	Aunt Juley	237	" do you think ought to be done ? "
74319	74327	74312	74312	her	181	" Done ? How should I know ? "
75533	75559	75517	75517	their	1537	" Oh , no ! do n't mistake me , I know you are not coming up to me . I can hardly expect that ! "
75576	75599	75601	75601	she	317	" Now , to please me , do let me introduce you to Miss Pink ; such a nice girl , really ! "
75610	75624	75601	75601	she	317	" Miss Pink - Mr. Gathercole . Can you spare him a dance ? "
75640	75647	75626	75627	Miss Pink	349	" Oh ! I think so ! "
76265	76284	76258	76258	women	817	" How beautifully your wife dances , Mr. Forsyte - it 's quite a pleasure to watch her ! "
76294	76299	76290	76290	his	1561	" You think so ? "
76380	76385	76371	76371	she	186	" Oh , no ! "
76425	76434	76436	76438	this licensed wag	1580	" Have you seen ' The Buccaneer ' ? "
76440	76452	76436	76438	this licensed wag	1580	" he 's on the warpath - hair cut and everything ! "
77273	77281	77270	77270	he	163	" Why do n't you get Irene ? "
77659	77694	77653	77653	she	595	" Bring some hot water , and go down and tell Mr. Forsyte that I feel perfectly rested . Say that if he 's too tired I can go to the dance by myself . "
77707	77710	77711	77711	she	2855	" Go , "
77714	77722	77711	77711	she	2855	" bring the hot water at once ! "
78089	78101	78077	78077	her	166	" I must go home , Gran ; I feel ill . "
78150	78158	78146	78146	he	316	" What is it , my darling ? "
79365	79374	79358	79358	one	2652	" My dear ! What a peculiar scent ! "
80010	80058	79996	79996	he	187	" That little Jew boy , Nathans , had given him the tip . He did n't care a cursh . He wash in - a mucker . If it did n't come up - well then , damme , the old man would have to pay ! "
80341	80367	80338	80338	Dartie	187	" It 'll put Master Soames 's nose out of joint to hear his wife 's been drivin ' in a hansom with Master Bosinney ! "
80371	80380	80368	80368	Winifred	187	" Do n't talk such nonsense , Monty ! "
80381	80384	80386	80386	Dartie	187	" Nonsense ! "
80388	80399	80386	80386	Dartie	187	" You do n't know women , my fine lady ! "
80408	80434	80404	80404	he	187	" How am I looking ? A bit puffy about the gills ? That fizz old George is so fond of is a windy wine ! "
81045	81055	81042	81042	Winifred	187	" Do n't be such a clown , Monty ! "
81071	81083	81084	81084	she	186	" I should like to see the common people making love , "
81087	81093	81084	81084	she	186	" it 's such fun ! "
82073	82084	82065	82065	Bosinney	168	" I am taking Irene back ; do you understand ? "
82105	82108	82109	82109	he	187	" Eh ? "
82112	82124	82109	82109	he	187	" What ? Not a bit . You take my wife ! "
82125	82129	82131	82131	Bosinney	168	" Get away ! "
82133	82143	82131	82131	Bosinney	168	" or I 'll throw you into the road ! "
82181	82185	82175	82175	Bosinney	168	" Go on ! "
82224	82228	82229	82229	he	187	" Drive on ! "
82235	82248	82229	82229	he	187	" and do n't you lose sight of that fellow in front ! "
82273	82315	82270	82270	he	187	" A pretty mess you 've made of it , to let the Buccaneer drive home with her ; why on earth could n't you keep hold of him ? He 's mad with love ; any fool can see that ! "
82636	82644	82646	82646	Winifred	187	" Good - night , Mr. Bosinney ! "
82667	82670	82672	82672	Dartie	187	" There ! "
82674	82691	82692	82692	He	168	" did you see the beast 's face ? What did I say ? Fine games ! "
82719	82738	82716	82716	She	1721	" I shall say nothing about it . I do n't see any use in making a fuss ! "
82767	82771	82772	82772	he	168	" Quite right , "
82775	82789	82772	82772	he	168	" let Soames look after himself . He 's jolly well able to ! "
83637	83640	83634	83634	He	167	" Nothing . "
84224	84235	84236	84236	he	167	" I have n't seen you for a long time , "
84239	84251	84236	84236	he	167	" How are you getting on with my cousin 's house ? "
84252	84262	84196	84196	He	167	" It 'll be finished in about a week . "
84263	84268	84196	84196	He	167	" I congratulate you ! "
84269	84286	84236	84236	he	167	" Thanks - I do n't know that it 's much of a subject for congratulation . "
84287	84290	84292	84293	young Jolyon	167	" No ? "
84295	84337	84338	84338	He	167	" I should have thought you 'd be glad to get a long job like that off your hands ; but I suppose you feel it much as I do when I part with a picture - a sort of child ? "
84344	84347	84349	84350	the latter	2450	" Yes , "
84354	84375	84349	84350	the latter	2450	" it goes out from you and there 's an end of it . I did n't know you painted . "
84376	84392	84236	84236	he	167	" Only water - colours ; I ca n't say I believe in my work . "
84393	84418	84349	84350	the latter	2450	" Do n't believe in it ? There - how can you do it ? Work 's no use unless you believe in it ! "
84419	84422	84424	84425	young Jolyon	167	" Good , "
84427	84487	84424	84425	young Jolyon	167	" it 's exactly what I 've always said . By - the - bye , have you noticed that whenever one says ' Good , ' one always adds ' it 's exactly what I 've always said ' ! But if you ask me how I do it , I answer , because I 'm a Forsyte . "
84488	84500	84349	84350	the latter	2450	" A Forsyte ! I never thought of you as one ! "
84501	84505	84507	84508	young Jolyon	167	" A Forsyte , "
84510	84541	84507	84508	young Jolyon	167	" is not an uncommon animal . There are hundreds among the members of this Club . Hundreds out there in the streets ; you meet them wherever you go ! "
84542	84554	84556	84556	Bosinney	168	" And how do you tell them , may I ask ? "
84558	84608	84556	84556	Bosinney	168	" By their sense of property . A Forsyte takes a practical - one might say a commonsense - view of things , and a practical view of things is based fundamentally on a sense of property . A Forsyte , you will notice , never gives himself away . "
84609	84612	84613	84614	Young Jolyon	167	" Joking ? "
84619	84794	84800	84800	Bosinney	168	" Not much . As a Forsyte myself , I have no business to talk . But I 'm a kind of thoroughbred mongrel ; now , there 's no mistaking you : You 're as different from me as I am from my Uncle James , who is the perfect specimen of a Forsyte . His sense of property is extreme , while you have practically none . Without me in between , you would seem like a different species . I 'm the missing link . We are , of course , all of us the slaves of property , and I admit that it 's a question of degree , but what I call a ' Forsyte ' is a man who is decidedly more than less a slave of property . He knows a good thing , he knows a safe thing , and his grip on property - it does n't matter whether it be wives , houses , money , or reputation - is his hall - mark . "
84795	84798	84800	84800	Bosinney	168	" Ah ! "
84802	84809	84800	84800	Bosinney	168	" You should patent the word . "
84810	84815	84817	84818	young Jolyon	167	" I should like , "
84820	84826	84817	84818	young Jolyon	167	" to lecture on it : "
84887	84888	84889	84889	You	1853	" "
84894	84898	84889	84889	You	1853	" said Bosinney , "
84906	84907	84908	84908	They	1855	" "
84911	84916	84908	84908	They	1855	" repeated young Jolyon , "
85022	85023	85024	85024	I	0	" "
85034	85038	85029	85029	I	0	" said Bosinney , "
85057	85058	85049	85049	you	1853	" "
85061	85066	85049	85049	you	1853	" replied young Jolyon . "
85197	85205	85194	85195	a majority	1876	" He fixed his eyes on Bosinney : "
85226	85263	85194	85195	a majority	1876	" They looked at each other . - And , as though he had done that which no Forsyte did - given himself away , young Jolyon drew into his shell . Bosinney broke the silence . "
85275	85279	85266	85266	you	1877	" said he . "
85283	85288	85194	85195	a majority	1876	" replied young Jolyon , "
85350	85354	85369	85369	Swithin	233	" Bosinney smiled : "
85364	85365	85357	85359	the big one	1135	" "
85371	85376	85367	85367	you	1877	" asked young Jolyon . "
85428	85434	85417	85417	they	1888	" Bosinney seemed to ponder . "
85448	85453	85437	85437	you	1877	" he said suddenly . "
85462	85472	85454	85454	He	164	" Young Jolyon shot at him a penetrating glance . "
85475	85479	85480	85480	he	1887	" he said ; "
85529	85530	85550	85550	You	1877	" "
85538	85549	85536	85536	yourself	1877	" Young Jolyon acknowledged the hit by losing his smile . "
85553	85561	85550	85550	You	1877	" he said with a queer pride , "
85607	85619	85603	85603	I	0	" he ended very low , as though uttering a threat , "
85634	85679	85603	85603	I	0	" The colour rushed into Bosinney 's face , but soon receded , leaving it sallow - brown as before . He gave a short laugh , that left his lips fixed in a queer , fierce smile ; his eyes mocked young Jolyon . "
85682	85686	85603	85603	I	0	" he said . "
85706	86622	85695	85695	you	1877	" He rose . Young Jolyon looked after him as he walked away , and , resting his head on his hand , sighed . In the drowsy , almost empty room the only sounds were the rustle of newspapers , the scraping of matches being struck . He stayed a long time without moving , living over again those days when he , too , had sat long hours watching the clock , waiting for the minutes to pass - long hours full of the torments of uncertainty , and of a fierce , sweet aching ; and the slow , delicious agony of that season came back to him with its old poignancy . The sight of Bosinney , with his haggard face , and his restless eyes always wandering to the clock , had roused in him a pity , with which was mingled strange , irresistible envy . He knew the signs so well . Whither was he going - to what sort of fate ? What kind of woman was it who was drawing him to her by that magnetic force which no consideration of honour , no principle , no interest could withstand ; from which the only escape was flight . Flight ! But why should Bosinney fly ? A man fled when he was in danger of destroying hearth and home , when there were children , when he felt himself trampling down ideals , breaking something . But here , so he had heard , it was all broken to his hand . He himself had not fled , nor would he fly if it were all to come over again . Yet he had gone further than Bosinney , had broken up his own unhappy home , not someone else 's : And the old saying came back to him : ' A man 's fate lies in his own heart . ' In his own heart ! The proof of the pudding was in the eating - Bosinney had still to eat his pudding . His thoughts passed to the woman , the woman whom he did not know , but the outline of whose story he had heard . An unhappy marriage ! No ill - treatment - only that indefinable malaise , that terrible blight which killed all sweetness under Heaven ; and so from day to day , from night to night , from week to week , from year to year , till death should end it . But young Jolyon , the bitterness of whose own feelings time had assuaged , saw Soames ' side of the question too . Whence should a man like his cousin , saturated with all the prejudices and beliefs of his class , draw the insight or inspiration necessary to break up this life ? It was a question of imagination , of projecting himself into the future beyond the unpleasant gossip , sneers , and tattle that followed on such separations , beyond the passing pangs that the lack of the sight of her would cause , beyond the grave disapproval of the worthy . But few men , and especially few men of Soames ' class , had imagination enough for that . A deal of mortals in this world , and not enough imagination to go round ! And sweet Heaven , what a difference between theory and practice ; many a man , perhaps even Soames , held chivalrous views on such matters , who when the shoe pinched found a distinguishing factor that made of himself an exception . Then , too , he distrusted his judgment . He had been through the experience himself , had tasted too the dregs the bitterness of an unhappy marriage , and how could he take the wide and dispassionate view of those who had never been within sound of the battle ? His evidence was too first - hand - like the evidence on military matters of a soldier who has been through much active service , against that of civilians who have not suffered the disadvantage of seeing things too close . Most people would consider such a marriage as that of Soames and Irene quite fairly successful ; he had money , she had beauty ; it was a case for compromise . There was no reason why they should not jog along , even if they hated each other . It would not matter if they went their own ways a little so long as the decencies were observed - the sanctity of the marriage tie , of the common home , respected . Half the marriages of the upper classes were conducted on these lines : Do not offend the susceptibilities of Society ; do not offend the susceptibilities of the Church . To avoid offending these is worth the sacrifice of any private feelings . The advantages of the stable home are visible , tangible , so many pieces of property ; there is no risk in the statu quo . To break up a home is at the best a dangerous experiment , and selfish into the bargain . This was the case for the defence , and young Jolyon sighed . ' The core of it all , ' he thought , ' is property , but there are many people who would not like it put that way . To them it is "
86629	87065	85695	85695	you	1877	" ; but the sanctity of the marriage tie is dependent on the sanctity of the family , and the sanctity of the family is dependent on the sanctity of property . And yet I imagine all these people are followers of One who never owned anything . It is curious ! And again young Jolyon sighed . ' Am I going on my way home to ask any poor devils I meet to share my dinner , which will then be too little for myself , or , at all events , for my wife , who is necessary to my health and happiness ? It may be that after all Soames does well to exercise his rights and support by his practice the sacred principle of property which benefits us all , with the exception of those who suffer by the process . ' And so he left his chair , threaded his way through the maze of seats , took his hat , and languidly up the hot streets crowded with carriages , reeking with dusty odours , wended his way home . Before reaching Wistaria Avenue he removed old Jolyon 's letter from his pocket , and tearing it carefully into tiny pieces , scattered them in the dust of the road . He let himself in with his key , and called his wife 's name . But she had gone out , taking Jolly and Holly , and the house was empty ; alone in the garden the dog Balthasar lay in the shade snapping at flies . Young Jolyon took his seat there , too , under the pear - tree that bore no fruit . CHAPTER XI - BOSINNEY ON PAROLE The day after the evening at Richmond Soames returned from Henley by a morning train . Not constitutionally interested in amphibious sports , his visit had been one of business rather than pleasure , a client of some importance having asked him down . He went straight to the City , but finding things slack , he left at three o'clock , glad of this chance to get home quietly . Irene did not expect him . Not that he had any desire to spy on her actions , but there was no harm in thus unexpectedly surveying the scene . After changing to Park clothes he went into the drawing - room . She was sitting idly in the corner of the sofa , her favourite seat ; and there were circles under her eyes , as though she had not slept . He asked : "
87078	87079	87076	87076	somebody	543	" "
87087	87088	87076	87076	somebody	543	" "
87091	87092	87093	87094	Mr. Bosinney	168	" "
87100	87101	87102	87102	Bosinney	168	" "
87111	87119	87104	87104	He	543	" To this she made no answer . "
87122	87126	87127	87127	I	0	" said Soames , "
87149	87150	87151	87151	I	0	" "
87164	87168	87159	87159	I	0	" Soames replied : "
87198	87216	87217	87217	I	0	" She did not answer . Soames was silent for some minutes ; at last he said : "
87236	87249	87231	87231	I	0	" He had not expected her to reply , but she did . "
87277	87278	87265	87265	I	0	" "
87286	87292	87265	87265	I	0	" He watched her askance . "
87316	87320	87297	87297	you	0	" Soames frowned . "
87323	87327	87351	87351	you	0	" he stammered - "
87339	87340	87341	87341	I	0	" "
87345	87349	87341	87341	I	0	" said Irene . "
87356	87370	87351	87351	you	0	" Soames turned away . Secretly alarmed , he took refuge in bluster . "
87442	87443	87446	87446	you	0	" "
87453	87468	87446	87446	you	0	" He felt her eyes resting on him with a strange , touching look . "
87473	87477	87446	87446	you	0	" he said ; "
87497	87498	87499	87499	I	0	" "
87504	87523	87499	87499	I	0	" He took a swift turn up and down the room ; then came and stood before her . "
87526	87530	87499	87499	I	0	" he said , "
87554	87560	87550	87550	your	1896	" She did not move . "
87564	87568	87561	87561	I	0	" said Soames , "
87580	87814	87561	87561	I	0	" Irene got up slowly and left the room . She came down with her hat on . They went out . In the Park , the motley hour of mid - afternoon , when foreigners and other pathetic folk drive , thinking themselves to be in fashion , had passed ; the right , the proper , hour had come , was nearly gone , before Soames and Irene seated themselves under the Achilles statue . It was some time since he had enjoyed her company in the Park . That was one of the past delights of the first two seasons of his married life , when to feel himself the possessor of this gracious creature before all London had been his greatest , though secret , pride . How many afternoons had he not sat beside her , extremely neat , with light grey gloves and faint , supercilious smile , nodding to acquaintances , and now and again removing his hat . His light grey gloves were still on his hands , and on his lips his smile sardonic , but where the feeling in his heart ? The seats were emptying fast , but still he kept her there , silent and pale , as though to work out a secret punishment . Once or twice he made some comment , and she bent her head , or answered "
87816	87840	87561	87561	I	0	" with a tired smile . Along the rails a man was walking so fast that people stared after him when he passed . "
87846	87850	87561	87561	I	0	" said Soames ; "
87863	87874	87851	87851	he	1903	" He turned ; Irene had made a rapid movement . "
87877	87881	87851	87851	he	1903	" he said : "
87889	87911	87886	87887	the Buccaneer	789	" And he sat still , with his sneering smile , conscious that Irene was sitting still , and smiling too . "
87918	88011	87913	87913	she	1907	" he thought . But she made no sign . Bosinney reached the end of the rails , and came walking back amongst the chairs , quartering his ground like a pointer . When he saw them he stopped dead , and raised his hat . The smile never left Soames ' face ; he also took off his hat . Bosinney came up , looking exhausted , like a man after hard physical exercise ; the sweat stood in drops on his brow , and Soames ' smile seemed to say : "
88030	88034	88024	88024	you	1907	" he asked . "
88042	88057	88035	88035	We	1910	" Bosinney did not seem to hear ; he made his answer to Irene : "
88074	88108	88109	88109	We	1910	" Somebody tapped Soames on the back , and spoke to him ; and in the exchange of those platitudes over his shoulder , he missed her answer , and took a resolution . "
88115	88121	88109	88109	We	1910	" he said to Bosinney ; "
88132	88146	88147	88147	You	1907	" Into that invitation he put a strange bravado , a stranger pathos : "
88154	88162	88147	88147	You	1907	" his look and voice seemed saying , "
88177	88365	88366	88366	You	1912	" They started back to Montpellier Square together , Irene between them . In the crowded streets Soames went on in front . He did not listen to their conversation ; the strange resolution of trustfulness he had taken seemed to animate even his secret conduct . Like a gambler , he said to himself : ' It 's a card I dare not throw away - I must play it for what it 's worth . I have not too many chances . ' He dressed slowly , heard her leave her room and go downstairs , and , for full five minutes after , dawdled about in his dressing - room . Then he went down , purposely shutting the door loudly to show that he was coming . He found them standing by the hearth , perhaps talking , perhaps not ; he could not say . He played his part out in the farce , the long evening through - his manner to his guest more friendly than it had ever been before ; and when at last Bosinney went , he said : "
88383	90158	88372	88372	Irene	186	" Again his voice had the strange bravado and the stranger pathos ; but his hand was cold as ice . Loyal to his resolution , he turned away from their parting , turned away from his wife as she stood under the hanging lamp to say good - night - away from the sight of her golden head shining so under the light , of her smiling mournful lips ; away from the sight of Bosinney 's eyes looking at her , so like a dog 's looking at its master . And he went to bed with the certainty that Bosinney was in love with his wife . The summer night was hot , so hot and still that through every opened window came in but hotter air . For long hours he lay listening to her breathing . She could sleep , but he must lie awake . And , lying awake , he hardened himself to play the part of the serene and trusting husband . In the small hours he slipped out of bed , and passing into his dressing - room , leaned by the open window . He could hardly breathe . A night four years ago came back to him - the night but one before his marriage ; as hot and stifling as this . He remembered how he had lain in a long cane chair in the window of his sitting - room off Victoria Street . Down below in a side street a man had banged at a door , a woman had cried out ; he remembered , as though it were now , the sound of the scuffle , the slam of the door , the dead silence that followed . And then the early water - cart , cleansing the reek of the streets , had approached through the strange - seeming , useless lamp - light ; he seemed to hear again its rumble , nearer and nearer , till it passed and slowly died away . He leaned far out of the dressing - room window over the little court below , and saw the first light spread . The outlines of dark walls and roofs were blurred for a moment , then came out sharper than before . He remembered how that other night he had watched the lamps paling all the length of Victoria Street ; how he had hurried on his clothes and gone down into the street , down past houses and squares , to the street where she was staying , and there had stood and looked at the front of the little house , as still and grey as the face of a dead man . And suddenly it shot through his mind ; like a sick man 's fancy : What 's he doing ? - that fellow who haunts me , who was here this evening , who 's in love with my wife - prowling out there , perhaps , looking for her as I know he was looking for her this afternoon ; watching my house now , for all I can tell ! He stole across the landing to the front of the house , stealthily drew aside a blind , and raised a window . The grey light clung about the trees of the square , as though Night , like a great downy moth , had brushed them with her wings . The lamps were still alight , all pale , but not a soul stirred - no living thing in sight . Yet suddenly , very faint , far off in the deathly stillness , he heard a cry writhing , like the voice of some wandering soul barred out of heaven , and crying for its happiness . There it was again - again ! Soames shut the window , shuddering . Then he thought : ' Ah ! it 's only the peacocks , across the water . ' CHAPTER XII - JUNE PAYS SOME CALLS Jolyon stood in the narrow hall at Broadstairs , inhaling that odour of oilcloth and herrings which permeates all respectable seaside lodging - houses . On a chair - a shiny leather chair , displaying its horsehair through a hole in the top left - hand corner - stood a black despatch case . This he was filling with papers , with the Times , and a bottle of Eau - de Cologne . He had meetings that day of the ' Globular Gold Concessions ' and the ' New Colliery Company , Limited , ' to which he was going up , for he never missed a Board ; to ' miss a Board ' would be one more piece of evidence that he was growing old , and this his jealous Forsyte spirit could not bear . His eyes , as he filled that black despatch case , looked as if at any moment they might blaze up with anger . So gleams the eye of a schoolboy , baited by a ring of his companions ; but he controls himself , deterred by the fearful odds against him . And old Jolyon controlled himself , keeping down , with his masterful restraint now slowly wearing out , the irritation fostered in him by the conditions of his life . He had received from his son an unpractical letter , in which by rambling generalities the boy seemed trying to get out of answering a plain question . ' I 've seen Bosinney , ' he said ; ' he is not a criminal . The more I see of people the more I am convinced that they are never good or bad - merely comic , or pathetic . You probably do n't agree with me ! ' Old Jolyon did not ; he considered it cynical to so express oneself ; he had not yet reached that point of old age when even Forsytes , bereft of those illusions and principles which they have cherished carefully for practical purposes but never believed in , bereft of all corporeal enjoyment , stricken to the very heart by having nothing left to hope for - break through the barriers of reserve and say things they would never have believed themselves capable of saying . Perhaps he did not believe in ' goodness ' and ' badness ' any more than his son ; but as he would have said : He did n't know - could n't tell ; there might be something in it ; and why , by an unnecessary expression of disbelief , deprive yourself of possible advantage ? Accustomed to spend his holidays among the mountains , though like a true Forsyte he had never attempted anything too adventurous or too foolhardy , he had been passionately fond of them . And when the wonderful view mentioned in Baedeker - ' fatiguing but repaying ' - was disclosed to him after the effort of the climb , he had doubtless felt the existence of some great , dignified principle crowning the chaotic strivings , the petty precipices , and ironic little dark chasms of life . This was as near to religion , perhaps , as his practical spirit had ever gone . But it was many years since he had been to the mountains . He had taken June there two seasons running , after his wife died , and had realized bitterly that his walking days were over . To that old mountain - given confidence in a supreme order of things he had long been a stranger . He knew himself to be old , yet he felt young ; and this troubled him . It troubled and puzzled him , too , to think that he , who had always been so careful , should be father and grandfather to such as seemed born to disaster . He had nothing to say against Jo - who could say anything against the boy , an amiable chap ? - but his position was deplorable , and this business of June 's nearly as bad . It seemed like a fatality , and a fatality was one of those things no man of his character could either understand or put up with . In writing to his son he did not really hope that anything would come of it . Since the ball at Roger 's he had seen too clearly how the land lay - he could put two and two together quicker than most men - and , with the example of his own son before his eyes , knew better than any Forsyte of them all that the pale flame singes men 's wings whether they will or no . In the days before June 's engagement , when she and Mrs. Soames were always together , he had seen enough of Irene to feel the spell she cast over men . She was not a flirt , not even a coquette - words dear to the heart of his generation , which loved to define things by a good , broad , inadequate word - but she was dangerous . He could not say why . Tell him of a quality innate in some women - a seductive power beyond their own control ! He would but answer : ' Humbug ! ' She was dangerous , and there was an end of it . He wanted to close his eyes to that affair . If it was , it was ; he did not want to hear any more about it - he only wanted to save June 's position and her peace of mind . He still hoped she might once more become a comfort to himself . And so he had written . He got little enough out of the answer . As to what young Jolyon had made of the interview , there was practically only the queer sentence : ' I gather that he 's in the stream . ' The stream ! What stream ? What was this new - fangled way of talking ? He sighed , and folded the last of the papers under the flap of the bag ; he knew well enough what was meant . June came out of the dining - room , and helped him on with his summer coat . From her costume , and the expression of her little resolute face , he saw at once what was coming . "
90165	90169	90159	90159	I	0	" she said . "
90190	90191	90186	90186	you	1914	" "
90199	90200	90195	90197	old Mrs. Smeech	372	" "
90209	90264	90195	90197	old Mrs. Smeech	372	" grumbled out old Jolyon . He did not believe her excuse , but ceased his opposition . There was no doing anything with that pertinacity of hers . At Victoria he put her into the carriage which had been ordered for himself - a characteristic action , for he had no petty selfishnesses . "
90277	91145	90269	90269	you	1914	" he said , and took a cab on into the city . June went first to a back - street in Paddington , where Mrs. Smeech , her ' lame duck , ' lived - an aged person , connected with the charring interest ; but after half an hour spent in hearing her habitually lamentable recital , and dragooning her into temporary comfort , she went on to Stanhope Gate . The great house was closed and dark . She had decided to learn something at all costs . It was better to face the worst , and have it over . And this was her plan : To go first to Phil 's aunt , Mrs. Baynes , and , failing information there , to Irene herself . She had no clear notion of what she would gain by these visits . At three o'clock she was in Lowndes Square . With a woman 's instinct when trouble is to be faced , she had put on her best frock , and went to the battle with a glance as courageous as old Jolyon 's itself . Her tremors had passed into eagerness . Mrs. Baynes , Bosinney 's aunt Louisa was her name , was in her kitchen when June was announced , organizing the cook , for she was an excellent housewife , and , as Baynes always said , there was ' a lot in a good dinner . ' He did his best work after dinner . It was Baynes who built that remarkably fine row of tall crimson houses in Kensington which compete with so many others for the title of ' the ugliest in London . ' On hearing June 's name , she went hurriedly to her bedroom , and , taking two large bracelets from a red morocco case in a locked drawer , put them on her white wrists - for she possessed in a remarkable degree that ' sense of property , ' which , as we know , is the touchstone of Forsyteism , and the foundation of good morality . Her figure , of medium height and broad build , with a tendency to embonpoint , was reflected by the mirror of her whitewood wardrobe , in a gown made under her own organization , of one of those half - tints , reminiscent of the distempered walls of corridors in large hotels . She raised her hands to her hair , which she wore a la Princesse de Galles , and touched it here and there , settling it more firmly on her head , and her eyes were full of an unconscious realism , as though she were looking in the face one of life 's sordid facts , and making the best of it . In youth her cheeks had been of cream and roses , but they were mottled now by middle - age , and again that hard , ugly directness came into her eyes as she dabbed a powder - puff across her forehead . Putting the puff down , she stood quite still before the glass , arranging a smile over her high , important nose , her , chin , never large , and now growing smaller with the increase of her neck , her thin - lipped , down - drooping mouth . Quickly , not to lose the effect , she grasped her skirts strongly in both hands , and went downstairs . She had been hoping for this visit for some time past . Whispers had reached her that things were not all right between her nephew and his fiancee . Neither of them had been near her for weeks . She had asked Phil to dinner many times ; his invariable answer had been ' Too busy . ' Her instinct was alarmed , and the instinct in such matters of this excellent woman was keen . She ought to have been a Forsyte ; in young Jolyon 's sense of the word , she certainly had that privilege , and merits description as such . She had married off her three daughters in a way that people said was beyond their deserts , for they had the professional plainness only to be found , as a rule , among the female kind of the more legal callings . Her name was upon the committees of numberless charities connected with the Church - dances , theatricals , or bazaars - and she never lent her name unless sure beforehand that everything had been thoroughly organized . She believed , as she often said , in putting things on a commercial basis ; the proper function of the Church , of charity , indeed , of everything , was to strengthen the fabric of ' Society . ' Individual action , therefore , she considered immoral . Organization was the only thing , for by organization alone could you feel sure that you were getting a return for your money . Organization - and again , organization ! And there is no doubt that she was what old Jolyon called her - "
91152	91161	90269	90269	you	1914	" - he went further , he called her "
91165	91939	90269	90269	you	1914	" The enterprises to which she lent her name were organized so admirably that by the time the takings were handed over , they were indeed skim milk divested of all cream of human kindness . But as she often justly remarked , sentiment was to be deprecated . She was , in fact , a little academic . This great and good woman , so highly thought of in ecclesiastical circles , was one of the principal priestesses in the temple of Forsyteism , keeping alive day and night a sacred flame to the God of Property , whose altar is inscribed with those inspiring words : ' Nothing for nothing , and really remarkably little for sixpence . ' When she entered a room it was felt that something substantial had come in , which was probably the reason of her popularity as a patroness . People liked something substantial when they had paid money for it ; and they would look at her - surrounded by her staff in charity ballrooms , with her high nose and her broad , square figure , attired in an uniform covered with sequins - as though she were a general . The only thing against her was that she had not a double name . She was a power in upper middle - class society , with its hundred sets and circles , all intersecting on the common battlefield of charity functions , and on that battlefield brushing skirts so pleasantly with the skirts of Society with the capital ' S. ' She was a power in society with the smaller 's , ' that larger , more significant , and more powerful body , where the commercially Christian institutions , maxims , and ' principle , ' which Mrs. Baynes embodied , were real life - blood , circulating freely , real business currency , not merely the sterilized imitation that flowed in the veins of smaller Society with the larger ' S. ' People who knew her felt her to be sound - a sound woman , who never gave herself away , nor anything else , if she could possibly help it . She had been on the worst sort of terms with Bosinney 's father , who had not infrequently made her the object of an unpardonable ridicule . She alluded to him now that he was gone as her ' poor , dear , irreverend brother . ' She greeted June with the careful effusion of which she was a mistress , a little afraid of her as far as a woman of her eminence in the commercial and Christian world could be afraid - for so slight a girl June had a great dignity , the fearlessness of her eyes gave her that . And Mrs. Baynes , too , shrewdly recognized that behind the uncompromising frankness of June 's manner there was much of the Forsyte . If the girl had been merely frank and courageous , Mrs. Baynes would have thought her ' cranky , ' and despised her ; if she had been merely a Forsyte , like Francie - let us say - she would have patronized her from sheer weight of metal ; but June , small though she was - Mrs. Baynes habitually admired quantity - gave her an uneasy feeling ; and she placed her in a chair opposite the light . There was another reason for her respect which Mrs. Baynes , too good a churchwoman to be worldly , would have been the last to admit - she often heard her husband describe old Jolyon as extremely well off , and was biassed towards his granddaughter for the soundest of all reasons . To - day she felt the emotion with which we read a novel describing a hero and an inheritance , nervously anxious lest , by some frightful lapse of the novelist , the young man should be left without it at the end . Her manner was warm ; she had never seen so clearly before how distinguished and desirable a girl this was . She asked after old Jolyon 's health . A wonderful man for his age ; so upright , and young looking , and how old was he ? Eighty - one ! She would never have thought it ! They were at the sea ! Very nice for them ; she supposed June heard from Phil every day ? Her light grey eyes became more prominent as she asked this question ; but the girl met the glance without flinching . "
91942	91946	90269	90269	you	1914	" she said , "
91951	91974	91947	91947	he	1918	" Mrs. Baynes 's eyes dropped ; they had no intention of doing so , but they did . They recovered immediately . "
91991	91992	91994	91994	he	1918	" "
91996	92032	91994	91994	he	1918	" said June . The brevity of the answer caused Mrs. Baynes 's bright smile a moment 's hesitation ; she disguised it by a quick movement , and spreading her skirts afresh , said : "
92059	92121	92038	92038	he	1918	" The conviction came suddenly to June that she was wasting her time ; even were she to put a question point - blank , she would never get anything out of this woman . ' Do you see him ? ' she asked , her face crimsoning . The perspiration broke out on Mrs. Baynes ' forehead beneath the powder . "
92186	92187	92189	92189	you	0	" "
92191	92328	92189	92189	you	0	" said June . Again she thought : ' I 'm only wasting my time . This woman will tell me nothing . ' She got up to go . A change came over Mrs. Baynes . She rose too ; her lips twitched , she fidgeted her hands . Something was evidently very wrong , and she did not dare to ask this girl , who stood there , a slim , straight little figure , with her decided face , her set jaw , and resentful eyes . She was not accustomed to be afraid of asking question 's - all organization was based on the asking of questions ! But the issue was so grave that her nerve , normally strong , was fairly shaken ; only that morning her husband had said : "
92342	93227	92329	92331	Old Mr. Forsyte	171	" And this girl stood there , holding out her hand - holding out her hand ! The chance might be slipping away - she could n't tell - the chance of keeping her in the family , and yet she dared not speak . Her eyes followed June to the door . It closed . Then with an exclamation Mrs. Baynes ran forward , wobbling her bulky frame from side to side , and opened it again . Too late ! She heard the front door click , and stood still , an expression of real anger and mortification on her face . June went along the Square with her bird - like quickness . She detested that woman now whom in happier days she had been accustomed to think so kind . Was she always to be put off thus , and forced to undergo this torturing suspense ? She would go to Phil himself , and ask him what he meant . She had the right to know . She hurried on down Sloane Street till she came to Bosinney 's number . Passing the swing - door at the bottom , she ran up the stairs , her heart thumping painfully . At the top of the third flight she paused for breath , and holding on to the bannisters , stood listening . No sound came from above . With a very white face she mounted the last flight . She saw the door , with his name on the plate . And the resolution that had brought her so far evaporated . The full meaning of her conduct came to her . She felt hot all over ; the palms of her hands were moist beneath the thin silk covering of her gloves . She drew back to the stairs , but did not descend . Leaning against the rail she tried to get rid of a feeling of being choked ; and she gazed at the door with a sort of dreadful courage . No ! she refused to go down . Did it matter what people thought of her ? They would never know ! No one would help her if she did not help herself ! She would go through with it . Forcing herself , therefore , to leave the support of the wall , she rang the bell . The door did not open , and all her shame and fear suddenly abandoned her ; she rang again and again , as though in spite of its emptiness she could drag some response out of that closed room , some recompense for the shame and fear that visit had cost her . It did not open ; she left off ringing , and , sitting down at the top of the stairs , buried her face in her hands . Presently she stole down , out into the air . She felt as though she had passed through a bad illness , and had no desire now but to get home as quickly as she could . The people she met seemed to know where she had been , what she had been doing ; and suddenly - over on the opposite side , going towards his rooms from the direction of Montpellier Square - she saw Bosinney himself . She made a movement to cross into the traffic . Their eyes met , and he raised his hat . An omnibus passed , obscuring her view ; then , from the edge of the pavement , through a gap in the traffic , she saw him walking on . And June stood motionless , looking after him . CHAPTER XIII - PERFECTION OF THE HOUSE ' One mockturtle , clear ; one oxtail ; two glasses of port . ' In the upper room at French 's , where a Forsyte could still get heavy English food , James and his son were sitting down to lunch . Of all eating - places James liked best to come here ; there was something unpretentious , well - flavoured , and filling about it , and though he had been to a certain extent corrupted by the necessity for being fashionable , and the trend of habits keeping pace with an income that would increase , he still hankered in quiet City moments after the tasty fleshpots of his earlier days . Here you were served by hairy English waiters in aprons ; there was sawdust on the floor , and three round gilt looking - glasses hung just above the line of sight . They had only recently done away with the cubicles , too , in which you could have your chop , prime chump , with a floury - potato , without seeing your neighbours , like a gentleman . He tucked the top corner of his napkin behind the third button of his waistcoat , a practice he had been obliged to abandon years ago in the West End . He felt that he should relish his soup - the entire morning had been given to winding up the estate of an old friend . After filling his mouth with household bread , stale , he at once began : "
93263	93271	93272	93272	She	186	" Without looking up , Soames answered : "
93277	93278	93272	93272	She	186	" "
93303	93309	93301	93301	she	186	" Soames made no reply . "
93321	93325	93310	93310	I	0	" mumbled James ; "
93347	93353	93354	93354	I	0	" Soames lifted his eyes : "
93363	93396	93354	93354	I	0	" he said unexpectedly . The silence was only broken now by the supping of James 's soup . The waiter brought the two glasses of port , but Soames stopped him . "
93406	93410	93354	93354	I	0	" he said ; "
93420	93442	93354	93354	I	0	" Rousing himself from his reverie over the soup , James took one of his rapid shifting surveys of surrounding facts . "
93449	93453	93354	93354	I	0	" he said ; "
93486	93490	93472	93474	This young Bosinney'll	1932	" Soames nodded . "
93511	93515	93491	93491	I	0	" pursued James . "
93527	93528	93516	93516	I	0	" "
93536	93540	93516	93516	I	0	" replied Soames . "
93561	93893	93556	93556	I	0	" He signed to the waiter to bring the bill , which James paid . They parted at St. Paul 's , Soames branching off to the station , James taking his omnibus westwards . He had secured the corner seat next the conductor , where his long legs made it difficult for anyone to get in , and at all who passed him he looked resentfully , as if they had no business to be using up his air . He intended to take an opportunity this afternoon of speaking to Irene . A word in time saved nine ; and now that she was going to live in the country there was a chance for her to turn over a new leaf ! He could see that Soames would n't stand very much more of her goings on ! It did not occur to him to define what he meant by her ' goings on ' ; the expression was wide , vague , and suited to a Forsyte . And James had more than his common share of courage after lunch . On reaching home , he ordered out the barouche , with special instructions that the groom was to go too . He wished to be kind to her , and to give her every chance . When the door of No.62 was opened he could distinctly hear her singing , and said so at once , to prevent any chance of being denied entrance . Yes , Mrs. Soames was in , but the maid did not know if she was seeing people . James , moving with the rapidity that ever astonished the observers of his long figure and absorbed expression , went forthwith into the drawing - room without permitting this to be ascertained . He found Irene seated at the piano with her hands arrested on the keys , evidently listening to the voices in the hall . She greeted him without smiling . "
93904	93916	93556	93556	I	0	" he began , hoping at once to enlist her sympathy . "
93950	93981	93984	93984	you	0	" Irene looked at him as though about to refuse , but , seeming to change her mind , went upstairs , and came down again with her hat on . "
93990	93994	93984	93984	you	0	" she asked . "
94004	94015	93984	93984	you	0	" said James , spluttering out his words very quick ; "
94035	94080	94022	94022	I	0	" Irene hung back , but again changed her mind , and went out to the carriage , James brooding over her closely , to make quite sure . It was not before he had got her more than half way that he began : "
94106	94117	94118	94118	I	0	" Irene flushed , and said in a low voice : "
94128	94179	94180	94180	I	0	" James looked at her sharply ; he felt that now he had her in his own carriage , with his own horses and servants , he was really in command of the situation . She could not put him off ; nor would she make a scene in public . "
94189	94193	94180	94180	I	0	" he said . "
94201	94224	94194	94194	He	1942	" Irene 's answer was so low as to be almost inaudible among the sounds of traffic . He caught the words : "
94232	94233	94194	94194	He	1942	" "
94284	94285	94262	94262	he	1942	" "
94288	94320	94262	94262	he	1942	" Again James looked at her ; he could not make out the expression on her face . She looked almost as if she were going to cry , and yet .... "
94325	94330	94321	94321	I	0	" he muttered hastily , "
94341	94369	94331	94331	we	1946	" Irene 's lips quivered ; to his dismay James saw a tear steal down her cheek . He felt a choke rise in his own throat . "
94377	94381	94370	94370	We	1946	" he said , "
94386	94394	94370	94370	We	1946	" - he was going to say , "
94398	94404	94396	94396	yourself	0	" but changed it to - "
94417	94493	94494	94494	I	0	" Irene did not answer , and James , too , ceased speaking . There was something in her silence which disconcerted him ; it was not the silence of obstinacy , rather that of acquiescence in all that he could find to say . And yet he felt as if he had not had the last word . He could not understand this . He was unable , however , to long keep silence . "
94500	94504	94497	94498	young Bosinney	168	" he said , "
94513	94519	94520	94520	I	0	" Irene 's face changed . "
94525	94529	94533	94533	her	370	" she said ; "
94535	94536	94533	94533	her	370	" "
94543	94546	94538	94538	she	370	" No . "
94551	94555	94538	94538	she	370	" said James . "
94566	94572	94560	94560	she	370	" Irene turned on him . "
94575	94579	94560	94560	she	370	" she said , "
94585	94586	94583	94583	her	370	" "
94589	94598	94583	94583	her	370	" flustered James , frightened by her look , "
94621	94635	94604	94604	I	0	" He sat ruminating over his rebuff , and burst out at last : "
94697	94708	94709	94709	I	0	" Irene bent her head with a little smiling bow . "
94717	95228	94709	94709	I	0	" James did not know what on earth to answer . The bright hot morning had changed slowly to a grey , oppressive afternoon ; a heavy bank of clouds , with the yellow tinge of coming thunder , had risen in the south , and was creeping up . The branches of the trees dropped motionless across the road without the smallest stir of foliage . A faint odour of glue from the heated horses clung in the thick air ; the coachman and groom , rigid and unbending , exchanged stealthy murmurs on the box , without ever turning their heads . To James ' great relief they reached the house at last ; the silence and impenetrability of this woman by his side , whom he had always thought so soft and mild , alarmed him . The carriage put them down at the door , and they entered . The hall was cool , and so still that it was like passing into a tomb ; a shudder ran down James 's spine . He quickly lifted the heavy leather curtains between the columns into the inner court . He could not restrain an exclamation of approval . The decoration was really in excellent taste . The dull ruby tiles that extended from the foot of the walls to the verge of a circular clump of tall iris plants , surrounding in turn a sunken basin of white marble filled with water , were obviously of the best quality . He admired extremely the purple leather curtains drawn along one entire side , framing a huge white - tiled stove . The central partitions of the skylight had been slid back , and the warm air from outside penetrated into the very heart of the house . He stood , his hands behind him , his head bent back on his high , narrow shoulders , spying the tracery on the columns and the pattern of the frieze which ran round the ivory - coloured walls under the gallery . Evidently , no pains had been spared . It was quite the house of a gentleman . He went up to the curtains , and , having discovered how they were worked , drew them asunder and disclosed the picture - gallery , ending in a great window taking up the whole end of the room . It had a black oak floor , and its walls , again , were of ivory white . He went on throwing open doors , and peeping in . Everything was in apple - pie order , ready for immediate occupation . He turned round at last to speak to Irene , and saw her standing over in the garden entrance , with her husband and Bosinney . Though not remarkable for sensibility , James felt at once that something was wrong . He went up to them , and , vaguely alarmed , ignorant of the nature of the trouble , made an attempt to smooth things over . "
95236	95245	95231	95231	you	1953	" he said , holding out his hand . "
95260	95291	95256	95256	I	0	" Soames turned his back , and walked away . James looked from Bosinney 's frowning face to Irene , and , in his agitation , spoke his thoughts aloud : "
95308	95326	95303	95303	Nobody	2292	" And , making off after his son , he heard Bosinney 's short laugh , and his "
95336	95387	95332	95332	You	1953	" Most unfortunately he lost the rest . What had happened ? He glanced back . Irene was very close to the architect , and her face not like the face he knew of her . He hastened up to his son . Soames was pacing the picture - gallery . "
95393	95397	95332	95332	You	1953	" said James . "
95403	95425	95426	95427	Our friend	1905	" Soames looked at him with his supercilious calm unbroken , but James knew well enough that he was violently angry . "
95429	95433	95426	95427	Our friend	1905	" he said , "
95453	95502	95426	95427	Our friend	1905	" He turned round and walked back towards the door . James followed hurriedly , edging himself in front . He saw Irene take her finger from before her lips , heard her say something in her ordinary voice , and began to speak before he reached them . "
95540	95562	95567	95568	Mr. Forsyte	171	" He held out his hand . Bosinney did not take it , but , turning with a laugh , said : "
95578	95583	95567	95568	Mr. Forsyte	171	" and walked away . "
95586	95590	95567	95568	Mr. Forsyte	171	" began James , "
95596	95937	95591	95591	I	0	" But the ' sight of Irene 's face stopped him . Taking hold of his daughter - in - law by the elbow , he escorted her towards the carriage . He felt certain , quite certain , they had been making some appointment or other .... Nothing in this world is more sure to upset a Forsyte than the discovery that something on which he has stipulated to spend a certain sum has cost more . And this is reasonable , for upon the accuracy of his estimates the whole policy of his life is ordered . If he can not rely on definite values of property , his compass is amiss ; he is adrift upon bitter waters without a helm . After writing to Bosinney in the terms that have already been chronicled , Soames had dismissed the cost of the house from his mind . He believed that he had made the matter of the final cost so very plain that the possibility of its being again exceeded had really never entered his head . On hearing from Bosinney that his limit of twelve thousand pounds would be exceeded by something like four hundred , he had grown white with anger . His original estimate of the cost of the house completed had been ten thousand pounds , and he had often blamed himself severely for allowing himself to be led into repeated excesses . Over this last expenditure , however , Bosinney had put himself completely in the wrong . How on earth a fellow could make such an ass of himself Soames could not conceive ; but he had done so , and all the rancour and hidden jealousy that had been burning against him for so long was now focussed in rage at this crowning piece of extravagance . The attitude of the confident and friendly husband was gone . To preserve property - his wife - he had assumed it , to preserve property of another kind he lost it now . "
95940	95951	95591	95591	I	0	" he had said to Bosinney when he could speak , "
95977	96114	95970	95970	you	1958	" What he meant by those words he did not quite know at the time , but after dinner he looked up the correspondence between himself and Bosinney to make quite sure . There could be no two opinions about it - the fellow had made himself liable for that extra four hundred , or , at all events , for three hundred and fifty of it , and he would have to make it good . He was looking at his wife 's face when he came to this conclusion . Seated in her usual seat on the sofa , she was altering the lace on a collar . She had not once spoken to him all the evening . He went up to the mantelpiece , and contemplating his face in the mirror said : "
96134	96144	96145	96145	I	0	" She looked at him scornfully , and answered : "
96155	96156	96157	96157	You	1958	" "
96174	96175	96177	96177	you	1960	" "
96194	96195	96196	96196	I	0	" "
96199	96200	96196	96196	I	0	" "
96209	96210	96202	96202	you	1960	" "
96213	96214	96202	96202	you	1960	" "
96224	96276	96216	96216	you	1958	" Soames turned from the mirror , and unconsciously taking a china cup from the mantelpiece , clasped his hands around it as though praying . He saw her bosom rise and fall , her eyes darkening with anger , and taking no notice of the taunt , he asked quietly : "
96286	96287	96278	96278	you	1958	" "
96294	96375	96290	96290	I	0	" Her eyes met his , and he looked away . He neither believed nor disbelieved her , but he knew that he had made a mistake in asking ; he never had known , never would know , what she was thinking . The sight of her inscrutable face , the thought of all the hundreds of evenings he had seen her sitting there like that soft and passive , but unreadable , unknown , enraged him beyond measure . "
96384	96411	96412	96412	You	0	" he said , clenching his fingers so hard that he broke the fragile cup . The pieces fell into the grate . And Irene smiled . "
96417	96421	96412	96412	You	0	" she said , "
96427	96433	96412	96412	You	0	" Soames gripped her arm . "
96438	96442	96412	96412	You	0	" he said , "
96455	96666	96412	96412	You	0	" but turning on his heel , he left the room . CHAPTER XIV - SOAMES SITS ON THE STAIRS Soames went upstairs that night that he had gone too far . He was prepared to offer excuses for his words . He turned out the gas still burning in the passage outside their room . Pausing , with his hand on the knob of the door , he tried to shape his apology , for he had no intention of letting her see that he was nervous . But the door did not open , nor when he pulled it and turned the handle firmly . She must have locked it for some reason , and forgotten . Entering his dressing - room where the gas was also light and burning low , he went quickly to the other door . That too was locked . Then he noticed that the camp bed which he occasionally used was prepared , and his sleeping - suit laid out upon it . He put his hand up to his forehead , and brought it away wet . It dawned on him that he was barred out . He went back to the door , and rattling the handle stealthily , called : "
96679	96690	96692	96692	you	1963	" There was a faint rustling , but no answer . "
96708	96919	96920	96920	Irene	186	" He could catch the sound of her breathing close to the door , like the breathing of a creature threatened by danger . There was something terrifying in this inexorable silence , in the impossibility of getting at her . He went back to the other door , and putting his whole weight against it , tried to burst it open . The door was a new one - he had had them renewed himself , in readiness for their coming in after the honeymoon . In a rage he lifted his foot to kick in the panel ; the thought of the servants restrained him , and he felt suddenly that he was beaten . Flinging himself down in the dressing - room , he took up a book . But instead of the print he seemed to see his wife - with her yellow hair flowing over her bare shoulders , and her great dark eyes - standing like an animal at bay . And the whole meaning of her act of revolt came to him . She meant it to be for good . He could not sit still , and went to the door again . He could still hear her , and he called : "
96924	97923	96922	96922	Irene	186	" He did not mean to make his voice pathetic . In ominous answer , the faint sounds ceased . He stood with clenched hands , thinking . Presently he stole round on tiptoe , and running suddenly at the other door , made a supreme effort to break it open . It creaked , but did not yield . He sat down on the stairs and buried his face in his hands . For a long time he sat there in the dark , the moon through the skylight above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the stairway . He tried to be philosophical . Since she had locked her doors she had no further claim as a wife , and he would console himself with other women . It was but a spectral journey he made among such delights - he had no appetite for these exploits . He had never had much , and he had lost the habit . He felt that he could never recover it . His hunger could only be appeased by his wife , inexorable and frightened , behind these shut doors . No other woman could help him . This conviction came to him with terrible force out there in the dark . His philosophy left him ; and surly anger took its place . Her conduct was immoral , inexcusable , worthy of any punishment within his power . He desired no one but her , and she refused him ! She must really hate him , then ! He had never believed it yet . He did not believe it now . It seemed to him incredible . He felt as though he had lost for ever his power of judgment . If she , so soft and yielding as he had always judged her , could take this decided step - what could not happen ? Then he asked himself again if she were carrying on an intrigue with Bosinney . He did not believe that she was ; he could not afford to believe such a reason for her conduct - the thought was not to be faced . It would be unbearable to contemplate the necessity of making his marital relations public property . Short of the most convincing proofs he must still refuse to believe , for he did not wish to punish himself . And all the time at heart - he did believe . The moonlight cast a greyish tinge over his figure , hunched against the staircase wall . Bosinney was in love with her ! He hated the fellow , and would not spare him now . He could and would refuse to pay a penny piece over twelve thousand and fifty pounds - the extreme limit fixed in the correspondence ; or rather he would pay , he would pay and sue him for damages . He would go to Jobling and Boulter and put the matter in their hands . He would ruin the impecunious beggar ! And suddenly - though what connection between the thoughts ? - he reflected that Irene had no money either . They were both beggars . This gave him a strange satisfaction . The silence was broken by a faint creaking through the wall . She was going to bed at last . Ah ! Joy and pleasant dreams ! If she threw the door open wide he would not go in now ! But his lips , that were twisted in a bitter smile , twitched ; he covered his eyes with his hands .... It was late the following afternoon when Soames stood in the dining - room window gazing gloomily into the Square . The sunlight still showered on the plane - trees , and in the breeze their gay broad leaves shone and swung in rhyme to a barrel organ at the corner . It was playing a waltz , an old waltz that was out of fashion , with a fateful rhythm in the notes ; and it went on and on , though nothing indeed but leaves danced to the tune . The woman did not look too gay , for she was tired ; and from the tall houses no one threw her down coppers . She moved the organ on , and three doors off began again . It was the waltz they had played at Roger 's when Irene had danced with Bosinney ; and the perfume of the gardenias she had worn came back to Soames , drifted by the malicious music , as it had been drifted to him then , when she passed , her hair glistening , her eyes so soft , drawing Bosinney on and on down an endless ballroom . The organ woman plied her handle slowly ; she had been grinding her tune all day - grinding it in Sloane Street hard by , grinding it perhaps to Bosinney himself . Soames turned , took a cigarette from the carven box , and walked back to the window . The tune had mesmerized him , and there came into his view Irene , her sunshade furled , hastening homewards down the Square , in a soft , rose - coloured blouse with drooping sleeves , that he did not know . She stopped before the organ , took out her purse , and gave the woman money . Soames shrank back and stood where he could see into the hall . She came in with her latch - key , put down her sunshade , and stood looking at herself in the glass . Her cheeks were flushed as if the sun had burned them ; her lips were parted in a smile . She stretched her arms out as though to embrace herself , with a laugh that for all the world was like a sob . Soames stepped forward . "
97928	97954	96922	96922	Irene	186	" he said . But as though shot she spun round , and would have passed him up the stairs . He barred the way . "
97960	98062	96922	96922	Irene	186	" he said , and his eyes fastened on a curl of hair fallen loose across her ear .... He hardly recognised her . She seemed on fire , so deep and rich the colour of her cheeks , her eyes , her lips , and of the unusual blouse she wore . She put up her hand and smoothed back the curl . She was breathing fast and deep , as though she had been running , and with every breath perfume seemed to come from her hair , and from her body , like perfume from an opening flower . "
98070	98075	98063	98063	I	0	" he said slowly , "
98084	98100	96922	96922	Irene	186	" He lifted his finger towards her breast , but she dashed his hand aside . "
98106	98120	96922	96922	Irene	186	" she cried . He caught her wrist ; she wrenched it away . "
98128	98132	96922	96922	Irene	186	" he asked . "
98141	99084	96922	96922	Irene	186	" With those words she fled upstairs . Outside - in thanksgiving - at the very door , the organ - grinder was playing the waltz . And Soames stood motionless . What prevented him from following her ? Was it that , with the eyes of faith , he saw Bosinney looking down from that high window in Sloane Street , straining his eyes for yet another glimpse of Irene 's vanished figure , cooling his flushed face , dreaming of the moment when she flung herself on his breast - the scent of her still in the air around , and the sound of her laugh that was like a sob ? PART III CHAPTER I - MRS . MACANDER 'S EVIDENCE Many people , no doubt , including the editor of the ' Ultra Vivisectionist , ' then in the bloom of its first youth , would say that Soames was less than a man not to have removed the locks from his wife 's doors , and , after beating her soundly , resumed wedded happiness . Brutality is not so deplorably diluted by humaneness as it used to be , yet a sentimental segment of the population may still be relieved to learn that he did none of these things . For active brutality is not popular with Forsytes ; they are too circumspect , and , on the whole , too softhearted . And in Soames there was some common pride , not sufficient to make him do a really generous action , but enough to prevent his indulging in an extremely mean one , except , perhaps , in very hot blood . Above all this a true Forsyte refused to feel himself ridiculous . Short of actually beating his wife , he perceived nothing to be done ; he therefore accepted the situation without another word . Throughout the summer and autumn he continued to go to the office , to sort his pictures , and ask his friends to dinner . He did not leave town ; Irene refused to go away . The house at Robin Hill , finished though it was , remained empty and ownerless . Soames had brought a suit against the Buccaneer , in which he claimed from him the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds . A firm of solicitors , Messrs. Freak and Able , had put in a defence on Bosinney 's behalf . Admitting the facts , they raised a point on the correspondence which , divested of legal phraseology , amounted to this : To speak of ' a free hand in the terms of this correspondence ' is an Irish bull . By a chance , fortuitous but not improbable in the close borough of legal circles , a good deal of information came to Soames ' ear anent this line of policy , the working partner in his firm , Bustard , happening to sit next at dinner at Walmisley 's , the Taxing Master , to young Chankery , of the Common Law Bar . The necessity for talking what is known as ' shop , ' which comes on all lawyers with the removal of the ladies , caused Chankery , a young and promising advocate , to propound an impersonal conundrum to his neighbour , whose name he did not know , for , seated as he permanently was in the background , Bustard had practically no name . He had , said Chankery , a case coming on with a ' ve ry nice point . ' He then explained , preserving every professional discretion , the riddle in Soames ' case . Everyone , he said , to whom he had spoken , thought it a nice point . The issue was small unfortunately , ' though d - - d serious for his client he believed ' - Walmisley 's champagne was bad but plentiful . A Judge would make short work of it , he was afraid . He intended to make a big effort - the point was a nice one . What did his neighbour say ? Bustard , a model of secrecy , said nothing . He related the incident to Soames however with some malice , for this quiet man was capable of human feeling , ending with his own opinion that the point was ' a very nice one . ' In accordance with his resolve , our Forsyte had put his interests into the hands of Jobling and Boulter . From the moment of doing so he regretted that he had not acted for himself . On receiving a copy of Bosinney 's defence he went over to their offices . Boulter , who had the matter in hand , Jobling having died some years before , told him that in his opinion it was rather a nice point ; he would like counsel 's opinion on it . Soames told him to go to a good man , and they went to Waterbuck , Q.C. , marking him ten and one , who kept the papers six weeks and then wrote as follows : ' In my opinion the true interpretation of this correspondence depends very much on the intention of the parties , and will turn upon the evidence given at the trial . I am of opinion that an attempt should be made to secure from the architect an admission that he understood he was not to spend at the outside more than twelve thousand and fifty pounds . With regard to the expression , "
99095	99122	96922	96922	Irene	186	" to which my attention is directed , the point is a nice one ; but I am of opinion that upon the whole the ruling in "
99132	99576	96922	96922	Irene	186	" will apply . ' Upon this opinion they acted , administering interrogatories , but to their annoyance Messrs. Freak and Able answered these in so masterly a fashion that nothing whatever was admitted and that without prejudice . It was on October 1 that Soames read Waterbuck 's opinion , in the dining - room before dinner . It made him nervous ; not so much because of the case of ' Boileau v. The Blasted Cement Co. , Ltd. , ' as that the point had lately begun to seem to him , too , a nice one ; there was about it just that pleasant flavour of subtlety so attractive to the best legal appetites . To have his own impression confirmed by Waterbuck , Q.C. , would have disturbed any man . He sat thinking it over , and staring at the empty grate , for though autumn had come , the weather kept as gloriously fine that jubilee year as if it were still high August . It was not pleasant to be disturbed ; he desired too passionately to set his foot on Bosinney 's neck . Though he had not seen the architect since the last afternoon at Robin Hill , he was never free from the sense of his presence - never free from the memory of his worn face with its high cheek bones and enthusiastic eyes . It would not be too much to say that he had never got rid of the feeling of that night when he heard the peacock 's cry at dawn - the feeling that Bosinney haunted the house . And every man 's shape that he saw in the dark evenings walking past , seemed that of him whom George had so appropriately named the Buccaneer . Irene still met him , he was certain ; where , or how , he neither knew , nor asked ; deterred by a vague and secret dread of too much knowledge . It all seemed subterranean nowadays . Sometimes when he questioned his wife as to where she had been , which he still made a point of doing , as every Forsyte should , she looked very strange . Her self - possession was wonderful , but there were moments when , behind the mask of her face , inscrutable as it had always been to him , lurked an expression he had never been used to see there . She had taken to lunching out too ; when he asked Bilson if her mistress had been in to lunch , as often as not she would answer : "
99581	99707	99579	99579	sir	730	" He strongly disapproved of her gadding about by herself , and told her so . But she took no notice . There was something that angered , amazed , yet almost amused him about the calm way in which she disregarded his wishes . It was really as if she were hugging to herself the thought of a triumph over him . He rose from the perusal of Waterbuck , Q.C. 's opinion , and , going upstairs , entered her room , for she did not lock her doors till bed - time - she had the decency , he found , to save the feelings of the servants . She was brushing her hair , and turned to him with strange fierceness . "
99713	99717	99710	99710	you	1968	" she said . "
99723	99727	99728	99728	I	0	" He answered : "
99753	99754	99744	99744	I	0	" "
99762	99763	99756	99756	you	1968	" "
99772	99773	99765	99765	you	1968	" "
99776	99777	99765	99765	you	1968	" "
99788	99789	99780	99780	I	0	" "
99792	99854	99780	99780	I	0	" He stared , amazed at the calmness of her answer . Her lips were compressed in a thin line ; her hair lay in fluffy masses on her bare shoulders , in all its strange golden contrast to her dark eyes - those eyes alive with the emotions of fear , hate , contempt , and odd , haunting triumph . "
99865	101957	101958	101961	A dear little woman	1974	" He turned round , and went sulkily out . He knew very well that he had no intention of taking steps , and he saw that she knew too - knew that he was afraid to . It was a habit with him to tell her the doings of his day : how such and such clients had called ; how he had arranged a mortgage for Parkes ; how that long - standing suit of Fryer v. Forsyte was getting on , which , arising in the preternaturally careful disposition of his property by his great uncle Nicholas , who had tied it up so that no one could get at it at all , seemed likely to remain a source of income for several solicitors till the Day of Judgment . And how he had called in at Jobson 's , and seen a Boucher sold , which he had just missed buying of Talleyrand and Sons in Pall Mall . He had an admiration for Boucher , Watteau , and all that school . It was a habit with him to tell her all these matters , and he continued to do it even now , talking for long spells at dinner , as though by the volubility of words he could conceal from himself the ache in his heart . Often , if they were alone , he made an attempt to kiss her when she said good - night . He may have had some vague notion that some night she would let him ; or perhaps only the feeling that a husband ought to kiss his wife . Even if she hated him , he at all events ought not to put himself in the wrong by neglecting this ancient rite . And why did she hate him ? Even now he could not altogether believe it . It was strange to be hated ! - the emotion was too extreme ; yet he hated Bosinney , that Buccaneer , that prowling vagabond , that night - wanderer . For in his thoughts Soames always saw him lying in wait - wandering . Ah , but he must be in very low water ! Young Burkitt , the architect , had seen him coming out of a third - rate restaurant , looking terribly down in the mouth ! During all the hours he lay awake , thinking over the situation , which seemed to have no end - unless she should suddenly come to her senses - never once did the thought of separating from his wife seriously enter his head .... And the Forsytes ! What part did they play in this stage of Soames ' subterranean tragedy ? Truth to say , little or none , for they were at the sea . From hotels , hydropathics , or lodging - houses , they were bathing daily ; laying in a stock of ozone to last them through the winter . Each section , in the vineyard of its own choosing , grew and culled and pressed and bottled the grapes of a pet sea - air . The end of September began to witness their several returns . In rude health and small omnibuses , with considerable colour in their cheeks , they arrived daily from the various termini . The following morning saw them back at their vocations . On the next Sunday Timothy 's was thronged from lunch till dinner . Amongst other gossip , too numerous and interesting to relate , Mrs. Septimus Small mentioned that Soames and Irene had not been away . It remained for a comparative outsider to supply the next evidence of interest . It chanced that one afternoon late in September , Mrs. MacAnder , Winifred Dartie 's greatest friend , taking a constitutional , with young Augustus Flippard , on her bicycle in Richmond Park , passed Irene and Bosinney walking from the bracken towards the Sheen Gate . Perhaps the poor little woman was thirsty , for she had ridden long on a hard , dry road , and , as all London knows , to ride a bicycle and talk to young Flippard will try the toughest constitution ; or perhaps the sight of the cool bracken grove , whence ' those two ' were coming down , excited her envy . The cool bracken grove on the top of the hill , with the oak boughs for roof , where the pigeons were raising an endless wedding hymn , and the autumn , humming , whispered to the ears of lovers in the fern , while the deer stole by . The bracken grove of irretrievable delights , of golden minutes in the long marriage of heaven and earth ! The bracken grove , sacred to stags , to strange tree - stump fauns leaping around the silver whiteness of a birch - tree nymph at summer dusk . This lady knew all the Forsytes , and having been at June 's ' at home , ' was not at a loss to see with whom she had to deal . Her own marriage , poor thing , had not been successful , but having had the good sense and ability to force her husband into pronounced error , she herself had passed through the necessary divorce proceedings without incurring censure . She was therefore a judge of all that sort of thing , and lived in one of those large buildings , where in small sets of apartments , are gathered incredible quantities of Forsytes , whose chief recreation out of business hours is the discussion of each other 's affairs . Poor little woman , perhaps she was thirsty , certainly she was bored , for Flippard was a wit . To see ' those two ' in so unlikely a spot was quite a merciful ' pick - me - up . ' At the MacAnder , like all London , Time pauses . This small but remarkable woman merits attention ; her all - seeing eye and shrewd tongue were inscrutably the means of furthering the ends of Providence . With an air of being in at the death , she had an almost distressing power of taking care of herself . She had done more , perhaps , in her way than any woman about town to destroy the sense of chivalry which still clogs the wheel of civilization . So smart she was , and spoken of endearingly as ' the little MacAnder ! ' Dressing tightly and well , she belonged to a Woman 's Club , but was by no means the neurotic and dismal type of member who was always thinking of her rights . She took her rights unconsciously , they came natural to her , and she knew exactly how to make the most of them without exciting anything but admiration amongst that great class to whom she was affiliated , not precisely perhaps by manner , but by birth , breeding , and the true , the secret gauge , a sense of property . The daughter of a Bedfordshire solicitor , by the daughter of a clergyman , she had never , through all the painful experience of being married to a very mild painter with a cranky love of Nature , who had deserted her for an actress , lost touch with the requirements , beliefs , and inner feeling of Society ; and , on attaining her liberty , she placed herself without effort in the very van of Forsyteism . Always in good spirits , and ' full of information , ' she was universally welcomed . She excited neither surprise nor disapprobation when encountered on the Rhine or at Zermatt , either alone , or travelling with a lady and two gentlemen ; it was felt that she was perfectly capable of taking care of herself ; and the hearts of all Forsytes warmed to that wonderful instinct , which enabled her to enjoy everything without giving anything away . It was generally felt that to such women as Mrs. MacAnder should we look for the perpetuation and increase of our best type of woman . She had never had any children . If there was one thing more than another that she could not stand it was one of those soft women with what men called ' charm ' about them , and for Mrs. Soames she always had an especial dislike . Obscurely , no doubt , she felt that if charm were once admitted as the criterion , smartness and capability must go to the wall ; and she hated - with a hatred the deeper that at times this so - called charm seemed to disturb all calculations - the subtle seductiveness which she could not altogether overlook in Irene . She said , however , that she could see nothing in the woman - there was no ' go ' about her - she would never be able to stand up for herself - anyone could take advantage of her , that was plain - she could not see in fact what men found to admire ! She was not really ill - natured , but , in maintaining her position after the trying circumstances of her married life , she had found it so necessary to be ' full of information , ' that the idea of holding her tongue about ' those two ' in the Park never occurred to her . And it so happened that she was dining that very evening at Timothy 's , where she went sometimes to ' cheer the old things up , ' as she was wo nt to put it . The same people were always asked to meet her : Winifred Dartie and her husband ; Francie , because she belonged to the artistic circles , for Mrs. MacAnder was known to contribute articles on dress to ' The Ladies Kingdom Come ' ; and for her to flirt with , provided they could be obtained , two of the Hayman boys , who , though they never said anything , were believed to be fast and thoroughly intimate with all that was latest in smart Society . At twenty - five minutes past seven she turned out the electric light in her little hall , and wrapped in her opera cloak with the chinchilla collar , came out into the corridor , pausing a moment to make sure she had her latch - key . These little self - contained flats were convenient ; to be sure , she had no light and no air , but she could shut it up whenever she liked and go away . There was no bother with servants , and she never felt tied as she used to when poor , dear Fred was always about , in his mooney way . She retained no rancour against poor , dear Fred , he was such a fool ; but the thought of that actress drew from her , even now , a little , bitter , derisive smile . Firmly snapping the door to , she crossed the corridor , with its gloomy , yellow - ochre walls , and its infinite vista of brown , numbered doors . The lift was going down ; and wrapped to the ears in the high cloak , with every one of her auburn hairs in its place , she waited motionless for it to stop at her floor . The iron gates clanked open ; she entered . There were already three occupants , a man in a great white waistcoat , with a large , smooth face like a baby 's , and two old ladies in black , with mittened hands . Mrs. MacAnder smiled at them ; she knew everybody ; and all these three , who had been admirably silent before , began to talk at once . This was Mrs. MacAnder 's successful secret . She provoked conversation . Throughout a descent of five stories the conversation continued , the lift boy standing with his back turned , his cynical face protruding through the bars . At the bottom they separated , the man in the white waistcoat sentimentally to the billiard room , the old ladies to dine and say to each other : "
101963	101964	101958	101961	A dear little woman	1974	" "
101969	102041	101958	101961	A dear little woman	1974	" and Mrs. MacAnder to her cab . When Mrs. MacAnder dined at Timothy 's , the conversation although Timothy himself could never be induced to be present took that wider , man - of - the - world tone current among Forsytes at large , and this , no doubt , was what put her at a premium there . Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester found it an exhilarating change . "
102045	102049	101958	101961	A dear little woman	1974	" they said , "
102055	102411	102414	102414	you	1976	" It was felt that she would do him good . She could tell you , for instance , the latest story of Sir Charles Fiste 's son at Monte Carlo ; who was the real heroine of Tynemouth Eddy 's fashionable novel that everyone was holding up their hands over , and what they were doing in Paris about wearing bloomers . She was so sensible , too , knowing all about that vexed question , whether to send young Nicholas ' eldest into the navy as his mother wished , or make him an accountant as his father thought would be safer . She strongly deprecated the navy . If you were not exceptionally brilliant or exceptionally well connected , they passed you over so disgracefully , and what was it after all to look forward to , even if you became an admiral - a pittance ! An accountant had many more chances , but let him be put with a good firm , where there was no risk at starting ! Sometimes she would give them a tip on the Stock Exchange ; not that Mrs. Small or Aunt Hester ever took it . They had indeed no money to invest ; but it seemed to bring them into such exciting touch with the realities of life . It was an event . They would ask Timothy , they said . But they never did , knowing in advance that it would upset him . Surreptitiously , however , for weeks after they would look in that paper , which they took with respect on account of its really fashionable proclivities , to see whether ' Bright 's Rubies ' or ' The Woollen Mackintosh Company ' were up or down . Sometimes they could not find the name of the company at all ; and they would wait until James or Roger or even Swithin came in , and ask them in voices trembling with curiosity how that ' Bolivia Lime and Speltrate ' was doing - they could not find it in the paper . And Roger would answer : "
102447	102514	102520	102520	you	1976	" and ascertaining what they had been told , he would go away , and , making inquiries in the City , would perhaps invest some of his own money in the concern . It was about the middle of dinner , just in fact as the saddle of mutton had been brought in by Smither , that Mrs. MacAnder , looking airily round , said : "
102554	102888	102543	102543	They	1977	" Winifred Dartie coughed , and no one said a word . It was the piece of evidence they had all unconsciously been waiting for . To do Mrs. MacAnder justice , she had been to Switzerland and the Italian lakes with a party of three , and had not heard of Soames ' rupture with his architect . She could not tell , therefore , the profound impression her words would make . Upright and a little flushed , she moved her small , shrewd eyes from face to face , trying to gauge the effect of her words . On either side of her a Hayman boy , his lean , taciturn , hungry face turned towards his plate , ate his mutton steadily . These two , Giles and Jesse , were so alike and so inseparable that they were known as the Dromios . They never talked , and seemed always completely occupied in doing nothing . It was popularly supposed that they were cramming for an important examination . They walked without hats for long hours in the Gardens attached to their house , books in their hands , a fox - terrier at their heels , never saying a word , and smoking all the time . Every morning , about fifty yards apart , they trotted down Campden Hill on two lean hacks , with legs as long as their own , and every morning about an hour later , still fifty yards apart , they cantered up again . Every evening , wherever they had dined , they might be observed about half - past ten , leaning over the balustrade of the Alhambra promenade . They were never seen otherwise than together ; in this way passing their lives , apparently perfectly content . Inspired by some dumb stirring within them of the feelings of gentlemen , they turned at this painful moment to Mrs. MacAnder , and said in precisely the same voice : "
102895	102936	102890	102890	you	1979	" Such was her surprise at being thus addressed that she put down her fork ; and Smither , who was passing , promptly removed her plate . Mrs. MacAnder , however , with presence of mind , said instantly : "
102948	102977	102890	102890	you	1979	" But afterwards in the drawing - room she sat down by Mrs. Small , determined to get to the bottom of the matter . And she began : "
102998	103046	102993	102996	a really lucky man	1982	" Her anxiety for information had not made sufficient allowance for that inner Forsyte skin which refuses to share its troubles with outsiders . Mrs. Septimus Small , drawing herself up with a creak and rustle of her whole person , said , shivering in her dignity : "
103060	103423	103424	103424	I	0	" CHAPTER II - NIGHT IN THE PARK Although with her infallible instinct Mrs. Small had said the very thing to make her guest ' more intriguee than ever , ' it is difficult to see how else she could truthfully have spoken . It was not a subject which the Forsytes could talk about even among themselves - to use the word Soames had invented to characterize to himself the situation , it was ' subterranean . ' Yet , within a week of Mrs. MacAnder 's encounter in Richmond Park , to all of them - save Timothy , from whom it was carefully kept - to James on his domestic beat from the Poultry to Park Lane , to George the wild one , on his daily adventure from the bow window at the Haversnake to the billiard room at the ' Red Pottle , ' was it known that ' those two ' had gone to extremes . George it was he who invented many of those striking expressions still current in fashionable circles voiced the sentiment more accurately than any one when he said to his brother Eustace that ' the Buccaneer ' was ' going it ' ; he expected Soames was about ' fed up . ' It was felt that he must be , and yet , what could be done ? He ought perhaps to take steps ; but to take steps would be deplorable . Without an open scandal which they could not see their way to recommending , it was difficult to see what steps could be taken . In this impasse , the only thing was to say nothing to Soames , and nothing to each other ; in fact , to pass it over . By displaying towards Irene a dignified coldness , some impression might be made upon her ; but she was seldom now to be seen , and there seemed a slight difficulty in seeking her out on purpose to show her coldness . Sometimes in the privacy of his bedroom James would reveal to Emily the real suffering that his son 's misfortune caused him . "
103429	103434	103424	103424	I	0	" he would say ; "
103546	103593	103594	103595	Our Father-	1993	" On his knees by the side of the bed , his eyes open and fixed with worry , he would breathe into the counterpane . Clad in his nightshirt , his neck poked forward , his back rounded , he resembled some long white bird . "
103597	103911	103594	103595	Our Father-	1993	" he repeated , turning over and over again the thought of this possible scandal . Like old Jolyon , he , too , at the bottom of his heart set the blame of the tragedy down to family interference . What business had that lot - he began to think of the Stanhope Gate branch , including young Jolyon and his daughter , as ' that lot ' - to introduce a person like this Bosinney into the family ? He had heard George 's soubriquet , ' The Buccaneer , ' but he could make nothing of that - the young man was an architect . He began to feel that his brother Jolyon , to whom he had always looked up and on whose opinion he had relied , was not quite what he had expected . Not having his eldest brother 's force of character , he was more sad than angry . His great comfort was to go to Winifred 's , and take the little Darties in his carriage over to Kensington Gardens , and there , by the Round Pond , he could often be seen walking with his eyes fixed anxiously on little Publius Dartie 's sailing - boat , which he had himself freighted with a penny , as though convinced that it would never again come to shore ; while little Publius - who , James delighted to say , was not a bit like his father skipping along under his lee , would try to get him to bet another that it never would , having found that it always did . And James would make the bet ; he always paid - sometimes as many as three or four pennies in the afternoon , for the game seemed never to pall on little Publius - and always in paying he said : "
103932	104879	103928	103930	a rich man	1036	" The thought of his little grandson 's growing wealth was a real pleasure to him . But little Publius knew a sweet - shop , and a trick worth two of that . And they would walk home across the Park , James ' figure , with high shoulders and absorbed and worried face , exercising its tall , lean protectorship , pathetically unregarded , over the robust child - figures of Imogen and little Publius . But those Gardens and that Park were not sacred to James . Forsytes and tramps , children and lovers , rested and wandered day after day , night after night , seeking one and all some freedom from labour , from the reek and turmoil of the streets . The leaves browned slowly , lingering with the sun and summer - like warmth of the nights . On Saturday , October 5 , the sky that had been blue all day deepened after sunset to the bloom of purple grapes . There was no moon , and a clear dark , like some velvety garment , was wrapped around the trees , whose thinned branches , resembling plumes , stirred not in the still , warm air . All London had poured into the Park , draining the cup of summer to its dregs . Couple after couple , from every gate , they streamed along the paths and over the burnt grass , and one after another , silently out of the lighted spaces , stole into the shelter of the feathery trees , where , blotted against some trunk , or under the shadow of shrubs , they were lost to all but themselves in the heart of the soft darkness . To fresh - comers along the paths , these forerunners formed but part of that passionate dusk , whence only a strange murmur , like the confused beating of hearts , came forth . But when that murmur reached each couple in the lamp - light their voices wavered , and ceased ; their arms enlaced , their eyes began seeking , searching , probing the blackness . Suddenly , as though drawn by invisible hands , they , too , stepped over the railing , and , silent as shadows , were gone from the light . The stillness , enclosed in the far , inexorable roar of the town , was alive with the myriad passions , hopes , and loves of multitudes of struggling human atoms ; for in spite of the disapproval of that great body of Forsytes , the Municipal Council - to whom Love had long been considered , next to the Sewage Question , the gravest danger to the community - a process was going on that night in the Park , and in a hundred other parks , without which the thousand factories , churches , shops , taxes , and drains , of which they were custodians , were as arteries without blood , a man without a heart . The instincts of self - forgetfulness , of passion , and of love , hiding under the trees , away from the trustees of their remorseless enemy , the ' sense of property , ' were holding a stealthy revel , and Soames , returning from Bayswater for he had been alone to dine at Timothy 's walking home along the water , with his mind upon that coming lawsuit , had the blood driven from his heart by a low laugh and the sound of kisses . He thought of writing to the Times the next morning , to draw the attention of the Editor to the condition of our parks . He did not , however , for he had a horror of seeing his name in print . But starved as he was , the whispered sounds in the stillness , the half - seen forms in the dark , acted on him like some morbid stimulant . He left the path along the water and stole under the trees , along the deep shadow of little plantations , where the boughs of chestnut trees hung their great leaves low , and there was blacker refuge , shaping his course in circles which had for their object a stealthy inspection of chairs side by side , against tree - trunks , of enlaced lovers , who stirred at his approach . Now he stood still on the rise overlooking the Serpentine , where , in full lamp - light , black against the silver water , sat a couple who never moved , the woman 's face buried on the man 's neck - a single form , like a carved emblem of passion , silent and unashamed . And , stung by the sight , Soames hurried on deeper into the shadow of the trees . In this search , who knows what he thought and what he sought ? Bread for hunger - light in darkness ? Who knows what he expected to find - impersonal knowledge of the human heart - the end of his private subterranean tragedy - for , again , who knew , but that each dark couple , unnamed , unnameable , might not be he and she ? But it could not be such knowledge as this that he was seeking - the wife of Soames Forsyte sitting in the Park like a common wench ! Such thoughts were inconceivable ; and from tree to tree , with his noiseless step , he passed . Once he was sworn at ; once the whisper , "
104889	105109	103928	103930	a rich man	1036	" sent the blood flying again from his heart , and he waited there , patient and dogged , for the two to move . But it was only a poor thin slip of a shop - girl in her draggled blouse who passed him , clinging to her lover 's arm . A hundred other lovers too whispered that hope in the stillness of the trees , a hundred other lovers clung to each other . But shaking himself with sudden disgust , Soames returned to the path , and left that seeking for he knew not what . CHAPTER III - MEETING AT THE BOTANICAL Young Jolyon , whose circumstances were not those of a Forsyte , found at times a difficulty in sparing the money needful for those country jaunts and researches into Nature , without having prosecuted which no watercolour artist ever puts brush to paper . He was frequently , in fact , obliged to take his colour - box into the Botanical Gardens , and there , on his stool , in the shade of a monkey - puzzler or in the lee of some India - rubber plant , he would spend long hours sketching . An Art critic who had recently been looking at his work had delivered himself as follows : "
105347	105410	105411	105411	You	2008	" Young Jolyon , standing by the little piano , where a bowl of dried rose leaves , the only produce of the garden , was deposited on a bit of faded damask , listened with his dim smile . Turning to his wife , who was looking at the speaker with an angry expression on her thin face , he said : "
105416	105417	105411	105411	You	2008	" "
105422	105438	105411	105411	You	2008	" she answered in her staccato voice , that still had a little foreign accent ; "
105444	106743	105411	105411	You	2008	" The critic looked at her , smiled ' deferentially , and said no more . Like everyone else , he knew their history . The words bore good fruit with young Jolyon ; they were contrary to all that he believed in , to all that he theoretically held good in his Art , but some strange , deep instinct moved him against his will to turn them to profit . He discovered therefore one morning that an idea had come to him for making a series of watercolour drawings of London . How the idea had arisen he could not tell ; and it was not till the following year , when he had completed and sold them at a very fair price , that in one of his impersonal moods , he found himself able to recollect the Art critic , and to discover in his own achievement another proof that he was a Forsyte . He decided to commence with the Botanical Gardens , where he had already made so many studies , and chose the little artificial pond , sprinkled now with an autumn shower of red and yellow leaves , for though the gardeners longed to sweep them off , they could not reach them with their brooms . The rest of the gardens they swept bare enough , removing every morning Nature 's rain of leaves ; piling them in heaps , whence from slow fires rose the sweet , acrid smoke that , like the cuckoo 's note for spring , the scent of lime trees for the summer , is the true emblem of the fall . The gardeners ' tidy souls could not abide the gold and green and russet pattern on the grass . The gravel paths must lie unstained , ordered , methodical , without knowledge of the realities of life , nor of that slow and beautiful decay which flings crowns underfoot to star the earth with fallen glories , whence , as the cycle rolls , will leap again wild spring . Thus each leaf that fell was marked from the moment when it fluttered a good - bye and dropped , slow turning , from its twig . But on that little pond the leaves floated in peace , and praised Heaven with their hues , the sunlight haunting over them . And so young Jolyon found them . Coming there one morning in the middle of October , he was disconcerted to find a bench about twenty paces from his stand occupied , for he had a proper horror of anyone seeing him at work . A lady in a velvet jacket was sitting there , with her eyes fixed on the ground . A flowering laurel , however , stood between , and , taking shelter behind this , young Jolyon prepared his easel . His preparations were leisurely ; he caught , as every true artist should , at anything that might delay for a moment the effort of his work , and he found himself looking furtively at this unknown dame . Like his father before him , he had an eye for a face . This face was charming ! He saw a rounded chin nestling in a cream ruffle , a delicate face with large dark eyes and soft lips . A black ' picture ' hat concealed the hair ; her figure was lightly poised against the back of the bench , her knees were crossed ; the tip of a patent - leather shoe emerged beneath her skirt . There was something , indeed , inexpressibly dainty about the person of this lady , but young Jolyon 's attention was chiefly riveted by the look on her face , which reminded him of his wife . It was as though its owner had come into contact with forces too strong for her . It troubled him , arousing vague feelings of attraction and chivalry . Who was she ? And what doing there , alone ? Two young gentlemen of that peculiar breed , at once forward and shy , found in the Regent 's Park , came by on their way to lawn tennis , and he noted with disapproval their furtive stares of admiration . A loitering gardener halted to do something unnecessary to a clump of pampas grass ; he , too , wanted an excuse for peeping . A gentleman , old , and , by his hat , a professor of horticulture , passed three times to scrutinize her long and stealthily , a queer expression about his lips . With all these men young Jolyon felt the same vague irritation . She looked at none of them , yet was he certain that every man who passed would look at her like that . Her face was not the face of a sorceress , who in every look holds out to men the offer of pleasure ; it had none of the ' devil 's beauty ' so highly prized among the first Forsytes of the land ; neither was it of that type , no less adorable , associated with the box of chocolate ; it was not of the spiritually passionate , or passionately spiritual order , peculiar to house - decoration and modern poetry ; nor did it seem to promise to the playwright material for the production of the interesting and neurasthenic figure , who commits suicide in the last act . In shape and colouring , in its soft persuasive passivity , its sensuous purity , this woman 's face reminded him of Titian 's ' Heavenly Love , ' a reproduction of which hung over the sideboard in his dining - room . And her attraction seemed to be in this soft passivity , in the feeling she gave that to pressure she must yield . For what or whom was she waiting , in the silence , with the trees dropping here and there a leaf , and the thrushes strutting close on grass , touched with the sparkle of the autumn rime ? Then her charming face grew eager , and , glancing round , with almost a lover 's jealousy , young Jolyon saw Bosinney striding across the grass . Curiously he watched the meeting , the look in their eyes , the long clasp of their hands . They sat down close together , linked for all their outward discretion . He heard the rapid murmur of their talk ; but what they said he could not catch . He had rowed in the galley himself ! He knew the long hours of waiting and the lean minutes of a half - public meeting ; the tortures of suspense that haunt the unhallowed lover . It required , however , but a glance at their two faces to see that this was none of those affairs of a season that distract men and women about town ; none of those sudden appetites that wake up ravening , and are surfeited and asleep again in six weeks . This was the real thing ! This was what had happened to himself ! Out of this anything might come ! Bosinney was pleading , and she so quiet , so soft , yet immovable in her passivity , sat looking over the grass . Was he the man to carry her off , that tender , passive being , who would never stir a step for herself ? Who had given him all herself , and would die for him , but perhaps would never run away with him ! It seemed to young Jolyon that he could hear her saying : "
106753	107473	106746	106746	darling	2010	" For he himself had experienced to the full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each woman 's heart that she is a drag on the man she loves . And he peeped at them no more ; but their soft , rapid talk came to his ears , with the stuttering song of some bird who seemed trying to remember the notes of spring : Joy - tragedy ? Which - which ? And gradually their talk ceased ; long silence followed . ' And where does Soames come in ? ' young Jolyon thought . ' People think she is concerned about the sin of deceiving her husband ! Little they know of women ! She 's eating , after starvation - taking her revenge ! And Heaven help her - for he 'll take his . ' He heard the swish of silk , and , spying round the laurel , saw them walking away , their hands stealthily joined .... At the end of July old Jolyon had taken his grand - daughter to the mountains ; and on that visit the last they ever paid June recovered to a great extent her health and spirits . In the hotels , filled with British Forsytes - for old Jolyon could not bear a ' set of Germans , ' as he called all foreigners - she was looked upon with respect - the only grand - daughter of that fine - looking , and evidently wealthy , old Mr. Forsyte . She did not mix freely with people - to mix freely with people was not June 's habit - but she formed some friendships , and notably one in the Rhone Valley , with a French girl who was dying of consumption . Determining at once that her friend should not die , she forgot , in the institution of a campaign against Death , much of her own trouble . Old Jolyon watched the new intimacy with relief and disapproval ; for this additional proof that her life was to be passed amongst ' lame ducks ' worried him . Would she never make a friendship or take an interest in something that would be of real benefit to her ? ' Taking up with a parcel of foreigners , ' he called it . He often , however , brought home grapes or roses , and presented them to ' Mam'zelle ' with an ingratiating twinkle . Towards the end of September , in spite of June 's disapproval , Mademoiselle Vigor breathed her last in the little hotel at St. Luc , to which they had moved her ; and June took her defeat so deeply to heart that old Jolyon carried her away to Paris . Here , in contemplation of the ' Venus de Milo ' and the ' Madeleine , ' she shook off her depression , and when , towards the middle of October , they returned to town , her grandfather believed that he had effected a cure . No sooner , however , had they established themselves in Stanhope Gate than he perceived to his dismay a return of her old absorbed and brooding manner . She would sit , staring in front of her , her chin on her hand , like a little Norse spirit , grim and intent , while all around in the electric light , then just installed , shone the great , drawing - room brocaded up to the frieze , full of furniture from Baple and Pullbred 's . And in the huge gilt mirror were reflected those Dresden china groups of young men in tight knee breeches , at the feet of full - bosomed ladies nursing on their laps pet lambs , which old Jolyon had bought when he was a bachelor and thought so highly of in these days of degenerate taste . He was a man of most open mind , who , more than any Forsyte of them all , had moved with the times , but he could never forget that he had bought these groups at Jobson 's , and given a lot of money for them . He often said to June , with a sort of disillusioned contempt : "
107500	107970	107973	107973	he	2014	" He was not a man who allowed his taste to be warped when he knew for solid reasons that it was sound . One of the first things that June did on getting home was to go round to Timothy 's . She persuaded herself that it was her duty to call there , and cheer him with an account of all her travels ; but in reality she went because she knew of no other place where , by some random speech , or roundabout question , she could glean news of Bosinney . They received her most cordially : And how was her dear grandfather ? He had not been to see them since May. Her Uncle Timothy was very poorly , he had had a lot of trouble with the chimney - sweep in his bedroom ; the stupid man had let the soot down the chimney ! It had quite upset her uncle . June sat there a long time , dreading , yet passionately hoping , that they would speak of Bosinney . But paralyzed by unaccountable discretion , Mrs. Septimus Small let fall no word , neither did she question June about him . In desperation the girl asked at last whether Soames and Irene were in town - she had not yet been to see anyone . It was Aunt Hester who replied : Oh , yes , they were in town , they had not been away at all . There was some little difficulty about the house , she believed . June had heard , no doubt ! She had better ask her Aunt Juley ! June turned to Mrs. Small , who sat upright in her chair , her hands clasped , her face covered with innumerable pouts . In answer to the girl 's look she maintained a strange silence , and when she spoke it was to ask June whether she had worn night - socks up in those high hotels where it must be so cold of a night . June answered that she had not , she hated the stuffy things ; and rose to leave . Mrs. Small 's infallibly chosen silence was far more ominous to her than anything that could have been said . Before half an hour was over she had dragged the truth from Mrs. Baynes in Lowndes Square , that Soames was bringing an action against Bosinney over the decoration of the house . Instead of disturbing her , the news had a strangely calming effect ; as though she saw in the prospect of this struggle new hope for herself . She learnt that the case was expected to come on in about a month , and there seemed little or no prospect of Bosinney 's success . "
107981	107986	107976	107976	I	0	" said Mrs. Baynes ; "
108045	108471	108037	108037	he	2014	" Her embonpoint had increased of late ; she was in the full swing of autumn organization , her writing - table literally strewn with the menus of charity functions . She looked meaningly at June , with her round eyes of parrot - grey . The sudden flush that rose on the girl 's intent young face - she must have seen spring up before her a great hope - the sudden sweetness of her smile , often came back to Lady Baynes in after years Baynes was knighted when he built that public Museum of Art which has given so much employment to officials , and so little pleasure to those working classes for whom it was designed . The memory of that change , vivid and touching , like the breaking open of a flower , or the first sun after long winter , the memory , too , of all that came after , often intruded itself , unaccountably , inopportunely on Lady Baynes , when her mind was set upon the most important things . This was the very afternoon of the day that young Jolyon witnessed the meeting in the Botanical Gardens , and on this day , too , old Jolyon paid a visit to his solicitors , Forsyte , Bustard , and Forsyte , in the Poultry . Soames was not in , he had gone down to Somerset House ; Bustard was buried up to the hilt in papers and that inaccessible apartment , where he was judiciously placed , in order that he might do as much work as possible ; but James was in the front office , biting a finger , and lugubriously turning over the pleadings in Forsyte v. Bosinney . This sound lawyer had only a sort of luxurious dread of the ' nice point , ' enough to set up a pleasurable feeling of fuss ; for his good practical sense told him that if he himself were on the Bench he would not pay much attention to it . But he was afraid that this Bosinney would go bankrupt and Soames would have to find the money after all , and costs into the bargain . And behind this tangible dread there was always that intangible trouble , lurking in the background , intricate , dim , scandalous , like a bad dream , and of which this action was but an outward and visible sign . He raised his head as old Jolyon came in , and muttered : "
108515	108598	108508	108508	I	0	" He held out the papers , regarding his elder brother with nervous gloom . Old Jolyon read them in silence , and while he read them James looked at the floor , biting his fingers the while . Old Jolyon pitched them down at last , and they fell with a thump amongst a mass of affidavits in 're Buncombe , deceased , ' one of the many branches of that parent and profitable tree , ' Fryer v. Forsyte . ' "
108608	108612	108604	108604	Soames	171	" he said , "
108632	108655	108623	108623	I	0	" James ' long upper lip twitched angrily ; he could not bear his son to be attacked in such a spot . "
108662	108687	108623	108623	I	0	" he began , but meeting his brother 's glance , direct , shrewd , judicial , he stopped . There was a silence . "
108696	108761	108688	108688	I	0	" said old Jolyon at last , tugging at his moustache . James ' curiosity was roused at once . Perhaps nothing in this life was more stimulating to him than a Will ; it was the supreme deal with property , the final inventory of a man 's belongings , the last word on what he was worth . He sounded the bell . "
108769	108781	108782	108782	You	2021	" he said to an anxious , dark - haired clerk . "
108789	108829	108782	108782	You	2021	" And through his mind there flashed the thought : ' Now , am I worth as much as he ? ' Old Jolyon put the Will in his breast pocket , and James twisted his long legs regretfully . "
108842	108846	108838	108838	they	2022	" he said . "
108858	108864	108847	108847	I	0	" answered old Jolyon sharply . "
108913	110046	110047	110047	He	2024	" With a cold handshake he was gone . James , his fixed grey - blue eye corkscrewing round some secret anxious image , began again to bite his finger . Old Jolyon took his Will to the offices of the New Colliery Company , and sat down in the empty Board Room to read it through . He answered ' Down - by - the - starn ' Hemmings so tartly when the latter , seeing his Chairman seated there , entered with the new Superintendent 's first report , that the Secretary withdrew with regretful dignity ; and sending for the transfer clerk , blew him up till the poor youth knew not where to look . It was not - by George - as he Down - by - the - starn would have him know , for a whippersnapper of a young fellow like him , to come down to that office , and think that he was God Almighty . He Down - by - the - starn had been head of that office for more years than a boy like him could count , and if he thought that when he had finished all his work , he could sit there doing nothing , he did not know him , Hemmings Down - by - the - starn , and so forth . On the other side of the green baize door old Jolyon sat at the long , mahogany - and - leather board table , his thick , loose - jointed , tortoiseshell eye - glasses perched on the bridge of his nose , his gold pencil moving down the clauses of his Will . It was a simple affair , for there were none of those vexatious little legacies and donations to charities , which fritter away a man 's possessions , and damage the majestic effect of that little paragraph in the morning papers accorded to Forsytes who die with a hundred thousand pounds . A simple affair . Just a bequest to his son of twenty thousand , and ' as to the residue of my property of whatsoever kind whether realty or personalty , or partaking of the nature of either - upon trust to pay the proceeds rents annual produce dividends or interest thereof and thereon to my said grand - daughter June Forsyte or her assigns during her life to be for her sole use and benefit and without , etc ... and from and after her death or decease upon trust to convey assign transfer or make over the said last - mentioned lands hereditaments premises trust moneys stocks funds investments and securities or such as shall then stand for and represent the same unto such person or persons whether one or more for such intents purposes and uses and generally in such manner way and form in all respects as the said June Forsyte notwithstanding coverture shall by her last Will and Testament or any writing or writings in the nature of a Will testament or testamentary disposition to be by her duly made signed and published direct appoint or make over give and dispose of the same And in default etc .... Provided always ... ' and so on , in seven folios of brief and simple phraseology . The Will had been drawn by James in his palmy days . He had foreseen almost every contingency . Old Jolyon sat a long time reading this Will ; at last he took half a sheet of paper from the rack , and made a prolonged pencil note ; then buttoning up the Will , he caused a cab to be called and drove to the offices of Paramor and Herring , in Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Jack Herring was dead , but his nephew was still in the firm , and old Jolyon was closeted with him for half an hour . He had kept the hansom , and on coming out , gave the driver the address - 3 , Wistaria Avenue . He felt a strange , slow satisfaction , as though he had scored a victory over James and the man of property . They should not poke their noses into his affairs any more ; he had just cancelled their trusteeships of his Will ; he would take the whole of his business out of their hands , and put it into the hands of young Herring , and he would move the business of his Companies too . If that young Soames were such a man of property , he would never miss a thousand a year or so ; and under his great white moustache old Jolyon grimly smiled . He felt that what he was doing was in the nature of retributive justice , richly deserved . Slowly , surely , with the secret inner process that works the destruction of an old tree , the poison of the wounds to his happiness , his will , his pride , had corroded the comely edifice of his philosophy . Life had worn him down on one side , till , like that family of which he was the head , he had lost balance . To him , borne northwards towards his son 's house , the thought of the new disposition of property , which he had just set in motion , appeared vaguely in the light of a stroke of punishment , levelled at that family and that Society , of which James and his son seemed to him the representatives . He had made a restitution to young Jolyon , and restitution to young Jolyon satisfied his secret craving for revenge - revenge against Time , sorrow , and interference , against all that incalculable sum of disapproval that had been bestowed by the world for fifteen years on his only son . It presented itself as the one possible way of asserting once more the domination of his will ; of forcing James , and Soames , and the family , and all those hidden masses of Forsytes - a great stream rolling against the single dam of his obstinacy - to recognise once and for all that he would be master . It was sweet to think that at last he was going to make the boy a richer man by far than that son of James , that ' man of property . ' And it was sweet to give to Jo , for he loved his son . Neither young Jolyon nor his wife were in young Jolyon indeed was not back from the Botanical , but the little maid told him that she expected the master at any moment : "
110064	110133	110047	110047	He	2024	" Old Jolyon said he would wait ; and sat down patiently enough in the faded , shabby drawing room , where , now that the summer chintzes were removed , the old chairs and sofas revealed all their threadbare deficiencies . He longed to send for the children ; to have them there beside him , their supple bodies against his knees ; to hear Jolly 's : "
110138	110678	110136	110136	Gran	353	" and see his rush ; and feel Holly 's soft little hand stealing up against his cheek . But he would not . There was solemnity in what he had come to do , and until it was over he would not play . He amused himself by thinking how with two strokes of his pen he was going to restore the look of caste so conspicuously absent from everything in that little house ; how he could fill these rooms , or others in some larger mansion , with triumphs of art from Baple and Pullbred 's ; how he could send little Jolly to Harrow and Oxford he no longer had faith in Eton and Cambridge , for his son had been there ; how he could procure little Holly the best musical instruction , the child had a remarkable aptitude . As these visions crowded before him , causing emotion to swell his heart , he rose , and stood at the window , looking down into the little walled strip of garden , where the pear - tree , bare of leaves before its time , stood with gaunt branches in the slow - gathering mist of the autumn afternoon . The dog Balthasar , his tail curled tightly over a piebald , furry back , was walking at the farther end , sniffing at the plants , and at intervals placing his leg for support against the wall . And old Jolyon mused . What pleasure was there left but to give ? It was pleasant to give , when you could find one who would be thankful for what you gave - one of your own flesh and blood ! There was no such satisfaction to be had out of giving to those who did not belong to you , to those who had no claim on you ! Such giving as that was a betrayal of the individualistic convictions and actions of his life , of all his enterprise , his labour , and his moderation , of the great and proud fact that , like tens of thousands of Forsytes before him , tens of thousands in the present , tens of thousands in the future , he had always made his own , and held his own , in the world . And , while he stood there looking down on the smut - covered foliage of the laurels , the black - stained grass - plot , the progress of the dog Balthasar , all the suffering of the fifteen years during which he had been baulked of legitimate enjoyment mingled its gall with the sweetness of the approaching moment . Young Jolyon came at last , pleased with his work , and fresh from long hours in the open air . On hearing that his father was in the drawing room , he inquired hurriedly whether Mrs. Forsyte was at home , and being informed that she was not , heaved a sigh of relief . Then putting his painting materials carefully in the little coat - closet out of sight , he went in . With characteristic decision old Jolyon came at once to the point . "
110688	110692	110686	110686	Jo	190	" he said . "
110752	110788	110789	110789	Yours	190	" The dog Balthasar , seated in the centre of the lawn , was examining his tail . Young Jolyon looked at the animal , but saw him dimly , for his eyes were misty . "
110802	110807	110789	110789	Yours	190	" said old Jolyon ; "
110846	111359	110843	110843	my	0	" Young Jolyon put his hand on his father 's shoulder , and , as neither spoke , the episode closed . Having seen his father into a hansom , young Jolyon came back to the drawing - room and stood , where old Jolyon had stood , looking down on the little garden . He tried to realize all that this meant to him , and , Forsyte that he was , vistas of property were opened out in his brain ; the years of half rations through which he had passed had not sapped his natural instincts . In extremely practical form , he thought of travel , of his wife 's costume , the children 's education , a pony for Jolly , a thousand things ; but in the midst of all he thought , too , of Bosinney and his mistress , and the broken song of the thrush . Joy - tragedy ! Which ? Which ? The old past - the poignant , suffering , passionate , wonderful past , that no money could buy , that nothing could restore in all its burning sweetness - had come back before him . When his wife came in he went straight up to her and took her in his arms ; and for a long time he stood without speaking , his eyes closed , pressing her to him , while she looked at him with a wondering , adoring , doubting look in her eyes . CHAPTER IV - VOYAGE INTO THE INFERNO The morning after a certain night on which Soames at last asserted his rights and acted like a man , he breakfasted alone . He breakfasted by gaslight , the fog of late November wrapping the town as in some monstrous blanket till the trees of the Square even were barely visible from the dining - room window . He ate steadily , but at times a sensation as though he could not swallow attacked him . Had he been right to yield to his overmastering hunger of the night before , and break down the resistance which he had suffered now too long from this woman who was his lawful and solemnly constituted helpmate ? He was strangely haunted by the recollection of her face , from before which , to soothe her , he had tried to pull her hands - of her terrible smothered sobbing , the like of which he had never heard , and still seemed to hear ; and he was still haunted by the odd , intolerable feeling of remorse and shame he had felt , as he stood looking at her by the flame of the single candle , before silently slinking away . And somehow , now that he had acted like this , he was surprised at himself . Two nights before , at Winifred Dartie 's , he had taken Mrs. MacAnder into dinner . She had said to him , looking in his face with her sharp , greenish eyes : "
111374	112141	111369	111371	that Mr. Bosinney	168	" Not deigning to ask what she meant , he had brooded over her words . They had roused in him a fierce jealousy , which , with the peculiar perversion of this instinct , had turned to fiercer desire . Without the incentive of Mrs. MacAnder 's words he might never have done what he had done . Without their incentive and the accident of finding his wife 's door for once unlocked , which had enabled him to steal upon her asleep . Slumber had removed his doubts , but the morning brought them again . One thought comforted him : No one would know - it was not the sort of thing that she would speak about . And , indeed , when the vehicle of his daily business life , which needed so imperatively the grease of clear and practical thought , started rolling once more with the reading of his letters , those nightmare - like doubts began to assume less extravagant importance at the back of his mind . The incident was really not of great moment ; women made a fuss about it in books ; but in the cool judgment of right - thinking men , of men of the world , of such as he recollected often received praise in the Divorce Court , he had but done his best to sustain the sanctity of marriage , to prevent her from abandoning her duty , possibly , if she were still seeing Bosinney , from .... No , he did not regret it . Now that the first step towards reconciliation had been taken , the rest would be comparatively - comparatively .... He , rose and walked to the window . His nerve had been shaken . The sound of smothered sobbing was in his ears again . He could not get rid of it . He put on his fur coat , and went out into the fog ; having to go into the City , he took the underground railway from Sloane Square station . In his corner of the first - class compartment filled with City men the smothered sobbing still haunted him , so he opened the Times with the rich crackle that drowns all lesser sounds , and , barricaded behind it , set himself steadily to con the news . He read that a Recorder had charged a grand jury on the previous day with a more than usually long list of offences . He read of three murders , five manslaughters , seven arsons , and as many as eleven rapes - a surprisingly high number - in addition to many less conspicuous crimes , to be tried during a coming Sessions ; and from one piece of news he went on to another , keeping the paper well before his face . And still , inseparable from his reading , was the memory of Irene 's tear - stained face , and the sounds from her broken heart . The day was a busy one , including , in addition to the ordinary affairs of his practice , a visit to his brokers , Messrs. Grin and Grinning , to give them instructions to sell his shares in the New Colliery Co. , Ltd. , whose business he suspected , rather than knew , was stagnating this enterprise afterwards slowly declined , and was ultimately sold for a song to an American syndicate ; and a long conference at Waterbuck , Q.C. 's chambers , attended by Boulter , by Fiske , the junior counsel , and Waterbuck , Q.C. , himself . The case of Forsyte v. Bosinney was expected to be reached on the morrow , before Mr. Justice Bentham . Mr. Justice Bentham , a man of common - sense rather than too great legal knowledge , was considered to be about the best man they could have to try the action . He was a ' strong ' Judge . Waterbuck , Q.C. , in pleasing conjunction with an almost rude neglect of Boulter and Fiske paid to Soames a good deal of attention , by instinct or the sounder evidence of rumour , feeling him to be a man of property . He held with remarkable consistency to the opinion he had already expressed in writing , that the issue would depend to a great extent on the evidence given at the trial , and in a few well directed remarks he advised Soames not to be too careful in giving that evidence . "
112149	112153	112146	112147	Mr. Forsyte	171	" he said , "
112158	112608	112146	112147	Mr. Forsyte	171	" and after he had spoken he laughed firmly , closed his lips tight , and scratched his head just below where he had pushed his wig back , for all the world like the gentleman - farmer for whom he loved to be taken . He was considered perhaps the leading man in breach of promise cases . Soames used the underground again in going home . The fog was worse than ever at Sloane Square station . Through the still , thick blur , men groped in and out ; women , very few , grasped their reticules to their bosoms and handkerchiefs to their mouths ; crowned with the weird excrescence of the driver , haloed by a vague glow of lamp - light that seemed to drown in vapour before it reached the pavement , cabs loomed dim - shaped ever and again , and discharged citizens , bolting like rabbits to their burrows . And these shadowy figures , wrapped each in his own little shroud of fog , took no notice of each other . In the great warren , each rabbit for himself , especially those clothed in the more expensive fur , who , afraid of carriages on foggy days , are driven underground . One figure , however , not far from Soames , waited at the station door . Some buccaneer or lover , of whom each Forsyte thought : ' Poor devil ! looks as if he were having a bad time ! ' Their kind hearts beat a stroke faster for that poor , waiting , anxious lover in the fog ; but they hurried by , well knowing that they had neither time nor money to spare for any suffering but their own . Only a policeman , patrolling slowly and at intervals , took an interest in that waiting figure , the brim of whose slouch hat half hid a face reddened by the cold , all thin , and haggard , over which a hand stole now and again to smooth away anxiety , or renew the resolution that kept him waiting there . But the waiting lover if lover he were was used to policemen 's scrutiny , or too absorbed in his anxiety , for he never flinched . A hardened case , accustomed to long trysts , to anxiety , and fog , and cold , if only his mistress came at last . Foolish lover ! Fogs last until the spring ; there is also snow and rain , no comfort anywhere ; gnawing fear if you bring her out , gnawing fear if you bid her stay at home ! "
112620	112657	112660	112661	poor devil	4921	" So any respectable Forsyte . Yet , if that sounder citizen could have listened at the waiting lover 's heart , out there in the fog and the cold , he would have said again : "
112669	113534	113535	113536	the Buccaneer	789	" Soames got into his cab , and , with the glass down , crept along Sloane Street , and so along the Brompton Road , and home . He reached his house at five . His wife was not in . She had gone out a quarter of an hour before . Out at such a time of night , into this terrible fog ! What was the meaning of that ? He sat by the dining - room fire , with the door open , disturbed to the soul , trying to read the evening paper . A book was no good - in daily papers alone was any narcotic to such worry as his . From the customary events recorded in the journal he drew some comfort . ' Suicide of an actress ' - ' Grave indisposition of a Statesman ' that chronic sufferer - ' Divorce of an army officer ' - ' Fire in a colliery ' - he read them all . They helped him a little - prescribed by the greatest of all doctors , our natural taste . It was nearly seven when he heard her come in . The incident of the night before had long lost its importance under stress of anxiety at her strange sortie into the fog . But now that Irene was home , the memory of her broken - hearted sobbing came back to him , and he felt nervous at the thought of facing her . She was already on the stairs ; her grey fur coat hung to her knees , its high collar almost hid her face , she wore a thick veil . She neither turned to look at him nor spoke . No ghost or stranger could have passed more silently . Bilson came to lay dinner , and told him that Mrs. Forsyte was not coming down ; she was having the soup in her room . For once Soames did not ' change ' ; it was , perhaps , the first time in his life that he had sat down to dinner with soiled cuffs , and , not even noticing them , he brooded long over his wine . He sent Bilson to light a fire in his picture - room , and presently went up there himself . Turning on the gas , he heaved a deep sigh , as though amongst these treasures , the backs of which confronted him in stacks , around the little room , he had found at length his peace of mind . He went straight up to the greatest treasure of them all , an undoubted Turner , and , carrying it to the easel , turned its face to the light . There had been a movement in Turners , but he had not been able to make up his mind to part with it . He stood for a long time , his pale , clean - shaven face poked forward above his stand - up collar , looking at the picture as though he were adding it up ; a wistful expression came into his eyes ; he found , perhaps , that it came to too little . He took it down from the easel to put it back against the wall ; but , in crossing the room , stopped , for he seemed to hear sobbing . It was nothing - only the sort of thing that had been bothering him in the morning . And soon after , putting the high guard before the blazing fire , he stole downstairs . Fresh for the morrow ! was his thought . It was long before he went to sleep .... It is now to George Forsyte that the mind must turn for light on the events of that fog - engulfed afternoon . The wittiest and most sportsmanlike of the Forsytes had passed the day reading a novel in the paternal mansion at Princes ' Gardens . Since a recent crisis in his financial affairs he had been kept on parole by Roger , and compelled to reside ' at home . ' Towards five o'clock he went out , and took train at South Kensington Station for everyone to - day went Underground . His intention was to dine , and pass the evening playing billiards at the Red Pottle - that unique hostel , neither club , hotel , nor good gilt restaurant . He got out at Charing Cross , choosing it in preference to his more usual St. James 's Park , that he might reach Jermyn Street by better lighted ways . On the platform his eyes - for in combination with a composed and fashionable appearance , George had sharp eyes , and was always on the look - out for fillips to his sardonic humour - his eyes were attracted by a man , who , leaping from a first - class compartment , staggered rather than walked towards the exit . ' So ho , my bird ! ' said George to himself ; ' why , it 's "
113538	113731	113535	113536	the Buccaneer	789	" ' and he put his big figure on the trail . Nothing afforded him greater amusement than a drunken man . Bosinney , who wore a slouch hat , stopped in front of him , spun around , and rushed back towards the carriage he had just left . He was too late . A porter caught him by the coat ; the train was already moving on . George 's practised glance caught sight of the face of a lady clad in a grey fur coat at the carriage window . It was Mrs. Soames - and George felt that this was interesting ! And now he followed Bosinney more closely than ever - up the stairs , past the ticket collector into the street . In that progress , however , his feelings underwent a change ; no longer merely curious and amused , he felt sorry for the poor fellow he was shadowing . ' The Buccaneer ' was not drunk , but seemed to be acting under the stress of violent emotion ; he was talking to himself , and all that George could catch were the words "
113736	114392	113535	113536	the Buccaneer	789	" Nor did he appear to know what he was doing , or where going ; but stared , hesitated , moved like a man out of his mind ; and from being merely a joker in search of amusement , George felt that he must see the poor chap through . He had ' taken the knock ' - ' taken the knock ! ' And he wondered what on earth Mrs. Soames had been saying , what on earth she had been telling him in the railway carriage . She had looked bad enough herself ! It made George sorry to think of her travelling on with her trouble all alone . He followed close behind Bosinney 's elbow - tall , burly figure , saying nothing , dodging warily - and shadowed him out into the fog . There was something here beyond a jest ! He kept his head admirably , in spite of some excitement , for in addition to compassion , the instincts of the chase were roused within him . Bosinney walked right out into the thoroughfare - a vast muffled blackness , where a man could not see six paces before him ; where , all around , voices or whistles mocked the sense of direction ; and sudden shapes came rolling slow upon them ; and now and then a light showed like a dim island in an infinite dark sea . And fast into this perilous gulf of night walked Bosinney , and fast after him walked George . If the fellow meant to put his ' twopenny ' under a ' bus , he would stop it if he could ! Across the street and back the hunted creature strode , not groping as other men were groping in that gloom , but driven forward as though the faithful George behind wielded a knout ; and this chase after a haunted man began to have for George the strangest fascination . But it was now that the affair developed in a way which ever afterwards caused it to remain green in his mind . Brought to a stand - still in the fog , he heard words which threw a sudden light on these proceedings . What Mrs. Soames had said to Bosinney in the train was now no longer dark . George understood from those mutterings that Soames had exercised his rights over an estranged and unwilling wife in the greatest - the supreme act of property . His fancy wandered in the fields of this situation ; it impressed him ; he guessed something of the anguish , the sexual confusion and horror in Bosinney 's heart . And he thought : ' Yes , it 's a bit thick ! I do n't wonder the poor fellow is half - cracked ! ' He had run his quarry to earth on a bench under one of the lions in Trafalgar Square , a monster sphynx astray like themselves in that gulf of darkness . Here , rigid and silent , sat Bosinney , and George , in whose patience was a touch of strange brotherliness , took his stand behind . He was not lacking in a certain delicacy - a sense of form - that did not permit him to intrude upon this tragedy , and he waited , quiet as the lion above , his fur collar hitched above his ears concealing the fleshy redness of his cheeks , concealing all but his eyes with their sardonic , compassionate stare . And men kept passing back from business on the way to their clubs - men whose figures shrouded in cocoons of fog came into view like spectres , and like spectres vanished . Then even in his compassion George 's Quilpish humour broke forth in a sudden longing to pluck these spectres by the sleeve , and say : "
114443	114613	114434	114434	He	2038	" In fancy he saw them gaping round the tortured lover ; and grinned as he thought of some respectable , newly - married spectre enabled by the state of his own affections to catch an inkling of what was going on within Bosinney ; he fancied he could see his mouth getting wider and wider , and the fog going down and down . For in George was all that contempt of the of the married middle - class - peculiar to the wild and sportsmanlike spirits in its ranks . But he began to be bored . Waiting was not what he had bargained for . ' After all , ' he thought , ' the poor chap will get over it ; not the first time such a thing has happened in this little city ! ' But now his quarry again began muttering words of violent hate and anger . And following a sudden impulse George touched him on the shoulder . Bosinney spun round . "
114623	115144	114620	114620	you	2041	" George could have stood it well enough in the light of the gas lamps , in the light of that everyday world of which he was so hardy a connoisseur ; but in this fog , where all was gloomy and unreal , where nothing had that matter - of - fact value associated by Forsytes with earth , he was a victim to strange qualms , and as he tried to stare back into the eyes of this maniac , he thought : ' If I see a bobby , I 'll hand him over ; he 's not fit to be at large . ' But waiting for no answer , Bosinney strode off into the fog , and George followed , keeping perhaps a little further off , yet more than ever set on tracking him down . ' He ca n't go on long like this , ' he thought . ' It 's God 's own miracle he 's not been run over already . ' He brooded no more on policemen , a sportsman 's sacred fire alive again within him . Into a denser gloom than ever Bosinney held on at a furious pace ; but his pursuer perceived more method in his madness - he was clearly making his way westwards . ' He 's really going for Soames ! ' thought George . The idea was attractive . It would be a sporting end to such a chase . He had always disliked his cousin . The shaft of a passing cab brushed against his shoulder and made him leap aside . He did not intend to be killed for the Buccaneer , or anyone . Yet , with hereditary tenacity , he stuck to the trail through vapour that blotted out everything but the shadow of the hunted man and the dim moon of the nearest lamp . Then suddenly , with the instinct of a town - stroller , George knew himself to be in Piccadilly . Here he could find his way blindfold ; and freed from the strain of geographical uncertainty , his mind returned to Bosinney 's trouble . Down the long avenue of his man - about - town experience , bursting , as it were , through a smirch of doubtful amours , there stalked to him a memory of his youth . A memory , poignant still , that brought the scent of hay , the gleam of moonlight , a summer magic , into the reek and blackness of this London fog - the memory of a night when in the darkest shadow of a lawn he had overheard from a woman 's lips that he was not her sole possessor . And for a moment George walked no longer in black Piccadilly , but lay again , with hell in his heart , and his face to the sweet - smelling , dewy grass , in the long shadow of poplars that hid the moon . A longing seized him to throw his arm round the Buccaneer , and say , "
115162	115242	115307	115307	she	2043	" But a voice yelled at him , and he started back . A cab rolled out of blackness , and into blackness disappeared . And suddenly George perceived that he had lost Bosinney . He ran forward and back , felt his heart clutched by a sickening fear , the dark fear which lives in the wings of the fog . Perspiration started out on his brow . He stood quite still , listening with all his might . "
115246	115268	115307	115307	she	2043	" as he confided to Dartie the same evening in the course of a game of billiards at the Red Pottle , "
115273	115303	115307	115307	she	2043	" Dartie twirled complacently at his dark moustache . He had just put together a neat break of twenty - three , - failing at a ' Jenny . ' "
115309	115391	115307	115307	she	2043	" he asked . George looked slowly at the ' man of the world 's ' fattish , sallow face , and a little grim smile lurked about the curves of his cheeks and his heavy - lidded eyes . ' No , no , my fine fellow , ' he thought , ' I 'm not going to tell you . ' For though he mixed with Dartie a good deal , he thought him a bit of a cad . "
115402	115411	115394	115398	some little love - lady	2044	" he said , and chalked his cue . "
115417	115428	115429	115429	I	0	" exclaimed Dartie - he used a more figurative expression . "
115438	115439	115441	115441	you	0	" "
115443	115448	115441	115441	you	0	" said George curtly . "
115457	115542	115451	115451	you	0	" He missed his shot . He was careful not to allude to the subject again till , towards eleven o'clock , having , in his poetic phraseology , ' looked upon the drink when it was yellow , ' he drew aside the blind , and gazed out into the street . The murky blackness of the fog was but faintly broken by the lamps of the ' Red Pottle , ' and no shape of mortal man or thing was in sight . "
115553	115557	115543	115543	I	0	" he said . "
115576	115583	115573	115574	a corpse	2049	" he added with strange dejection . "
115586	115602	115603	115603	He	2048	" said Dartie , in whom the recollection of his defeat at Richmond flared up . "
115617	115638	115612	115612	he	2048	" George turned on him , looking really formidable , with a sort of savage gloom on his big face . "
115642	115646	115612	115612	he	2048	" he said . "
115659	115991	115649	115649	I	0	" ' CHAPTER V - THE TRIAL In the morning of his case , which was second in the list , Soames was again obliged to start without seeing Irene , and it was just as well , for he had not as yet made up his mind what attitude to adopt towards her . He had been requested to be in court by half - past ten , to provide against the event of the first action a breach of promise collapsing , which however it did not , both sides showing a courage that afforded Waterbuck , Q.C. , an opportunity for improving his already great reputation in this class of case . He was opposed by Ram , the other celebrated breach of promise man . It was a battle of giants . The court delivered judgment just before the luncheon interval . The jury left the box for good , and Soames went out to get something to eat . He met James standing at the little luncheon - bar , like a pelican in the wilderness of the galleries , bent over a sandwich with a glass of sherry before him . The spacious emptiness of the great central hall , over which father and son brooded as they stood together , was marred now and then for a fleeting moment by barristers in wig and gown hurriedly bolting across , by an occasional old lady or rusty - coated man , looking up in a frightened way , and by two persons , bolder than their generation , seated in an embrasure arguing . The sound of their voices arose , together with a scent as of neglected wells , which , mingling with the odour of the galleries , combined to form the savour , like nothing but the emanation of a refined cheese , so indissolubly connected with the administration of British Justice . It was not long before James addressed his son . "
116035	116050	116051	116052	Your mother	2307	" He took a large bite at his sandwich and a mouthful of sherry . "
116054	116058	116051	116052	Your mother	2307	" he said , "
116071	116123	116051	116052	Your mother	2307	" A chill smile played round Soames ' lips ; he looked back at his father . Anyone who had seen the look , cold and furtive , thus interchanged , might have been pardoned for not appreciating the real understanding between them . James finished his sherry at a draught . "
116127	116773	116051	116052	Your mother	2307	" he asked . On returning to the court Soames took at once his rightful seat on the front bench beside his solicitor . He ascertained where his father was seated with a glance so sidelong as to commit nobody . James , sitting back with his hands clasped over the handle of his umbrella , was brooding on the end of the bench immediately behind counsel , whence he could get away at once when the case was over . He considered Bosinney 's conduct in every way outrageous , but he did not wish to run up against him , feeling that the meeting would be awkward . Next to the Divorce Court , this court was , perhaps , the favourite emporium of justice , libel , breach of promise , and other commercial actions being frequently decided there . Quite a sprinkling of persons unconnected with the law occupied the back benches , and the hat of a woman or two could be seen in the gallery . The two rows of seats immediately in front of James were gradually filled by barristers in wigs , who sat down to make pencil notes , chat , and attend to their teeth ; but his interest was soon diverted from these lesser lights of justice by the entrance of Waterbuck , Q.C. , with the wings of his silk gown rustling , and his red , capable face supported by two short , brown whiskers . The famous Q.C. looked , as James freely admitted , the very picture of a man who could heckle a witness . For all his experience , it so happened that he had never seen Waterbuck , Q.C. , before , and , like many Forsytes in the lower branch of the profession , he had an extreme admiration for a good cross - examiner . The long , lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed somewhat after seeing him , especially as he now perceived that Soames alone was represented by silk . Waterbuck , Q.C. , had barely screwed round on his elbow to chat with his Junior before Mr. Justice Bentham himself appeared - a thin , rather hen - like man , with a little stoop , clean - shaven under his snowy wig . Like all the rest of the court , Waterbuck rose , and remained on his feet until the judge was seated . James rose but slightly ; he was already comfortable , and had no opinion of Bentham , having sat next but one to him at dinner twice at the Bumley Tomms ' . Bumley Tomm was rather a poor thing , though he had been so successful . James himself had given him his first brief . He was excited , too , for he had just found out that Bosinney was not in court . ' Now , what 's he mean by that ? ' he kept on thinking . The case having been called on , Waterbuck , Q.C. , pushing back his papers , hitched his gown on his shoulder , and , with a semi - circular look around him , like a man who is going to bat , arose and addressed the Court . The facts , he said , were not in dispute , and all that his Lordship would be asked was to interpret the correspondence which had taken place between his client and the defendant , an architect , with reference to the decoration of a house . He would , however , submit that this correspondence could only mean one very plain thing . After briefly reciting the history of the house at Robin Hill , which he described as a mansion , and the actual facts of expenditure , he went on as follows : "
116922	116932	116906	116906	I	0	" He then read the correspondence . His client , "
116939	117097	116910	116910	your	2058	" was prepared to go into the box , and to swear that he never did authorize , that it was never in his mind to authorize , the expenditure of any money beyond the extreme limit of twelve thousand and fifty pounds , which he had clearly fixed ; and not further to waste the time of the court , he would at once call Mr. Forsyte . Soames then went into the box . His whole appearance was striking in its composure . His face , just supercilious enough , pale and clean - shaven , with a little line between the eyes , and compressed lips ; his dress in unostentatious order , one hand neatly gloved , the other bare . He answered the questions put to him in a somewhat low , but distinct voice . His evidence under cross - examination savoured of taciturnity . Had he not used the expression , "
117101	117105	117148	117148	you	2064	" ? No . "
117110	117129	117148	117148	you	2064	" The expression he had used was ' a free hand in the terms of this correspondence . ' "
117140	117141	117131	117131	you	2064	" "
117144	117145	117131	117131	you	2064	" "
117153	117154	117148	117148	you	2064	" "
117159	117160	117148	117148	you	2064	" "
117174	117175	117162	117162	you	2064	" "
117178	117179	117162	117162	you	2064	" "
117186	117187	117180	117180	You	2064	" "
117190	117191	117180	117180	You	2064	" "
117200	117201	117194	117198	a well - educated man	2067	" "
117204	117205	117194	117198	a well - educated man	2067	" "
117214	117215	117208	117208	you	2064	" "
117218	117811	117208	117208	you	2064	" Throughout this and much more cross - examination , which turned again and again around the ' nice point , ' James sat with his hand behind his ear , his eyes fixed upon his son . He was proud of him ! He could not but feel that in similar circumstances he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his replies , but his instinct told him that this taciturnity was the very thing . He sighed with relief , however , when Soames , slowly turning , and without any change of expression , descended from the box . When it came to the turn of Bosinney 's Counsel to address the Judge , James redoubled his attention , and he searched the Court again and again to see if Bosinney were not somewhere concealed . Young Chankery began nervously ; he was placed by Bosinney 's absence in an awkward position . He therefore did his best to turn that absence to account . He could not but fear - he said - that his client had met with an accident . He had fully expected him there to give evidence ; they had sent round that morning both to Mr. Bosinney 's office and to his rooms though he knew they were one and the same , he thought it was as well not to say so , but it was not known where he was , and this he considered to be ominous , knowing how anxious Mr. Bosinney had been to give his evidence . He had not , however , been instructed to apply for an adjournment , and in default of such instruction he conceived it his duty to go on . The plea on which he somewhat confidently relied , and which his client , had he not unfortunately been prevented in some way from attending , would have supported by his evidence , was that such an expression as a ' free hand ' could not be limited , fettered , and rendered unmeaning , by any verbiage which might follow it . He would go further and say that the correspondence showed that whatever he might have said in his evidence , Mr. Forsyte had in fact never contemplated repudiating liability on any of the work ordered or executed by his architect . The defendant had certainly never contemplated such a contingency , or , as was demonstrated by his letters , he would never have proceeded with the work - a work of extreme delicacy , carried out with great care and efficiency , to meet and satisfy the fastidious taste of a connoisseur , a rich man , a man of property . He felt strongly on this point , and feeling strongly he used , perhaps , rather strong words when he said that this action was of a most unjustifiable , unexpected , indeed - unprecedented character . If his Lordship had had the opportunity that he himself had made it his duty to take , to go over this very fine house and see the great delicacy and beauty of the decorations executed by his client - an artist in his most honourable profession - he felt convinced that not for one moment would his Lordship tolerate this , he would use no stronger word than daring attempt to evade legitimate responsibility . Taking the text of Soames ' letters , he lightly touched on ' Boileau v. The Blasted Cement Company , Limited . ' "
117816	117820	117208	117208	you	2064	" he said , "
117848	117949	117830	117830	I	0	" He then argued the ' nice point ' closely . With all due deference he submitted that Mr. Forsyte 's expression nullified itself . His client not being a rich man , the matter was a serious one for him ; he was a very talented architect , whose professional reputation was undoubtedly somewhat at stake . He concluded with a perhaps too personal appeal to the Judge , as a lover of the arts , to show himself the protector of artists , from what was occasionally - he said occasionally - the too iron hand of capital . "
117952	117956	117830	117830	I	0	" he said , "
117995	118371	117830	117830	I	0	" He would now call his client , in case he should at the last moment have found himself able to be present . The name Philip Baynes Bosinney was called three times by the Ushers , and the sound of the calling echoed with strange melancholy throughout the Court and Galleries . The crying of this name , to which no answer was returned , had upon James a curious effect : it was like calling for your lost dog about the streets . And the creepy feeling that it gave him , of a man missing , grated on his sense of comfort and security - on his cosiness . Though he could not have said why , it made him feel uneasy . He looked now at the clock - a quarter to three ! It would be all over in a quarter of an hour . Where could the young fellow be ? It was only when Mr. Justice Bentham delivered judgment that he got over the turn he had received . Behind the wooden erection , by which he was fenced from more ordinary mortals , the learned Judge leaned forward . The electric light , just turned on above his head , fell on his face , and mellowed it to an orange hue beneath the snowy crown of his wig ; the amplitude of his robes grew before the eye ; his whole figure , facing the comparative dusk of the Court , radiated like some majestic and sacred body . He cleared his throat , took a sip of water , broke the nib of a quill against the desk , and , folding his bony hands before him , began . To James he suddenly loomed much larger than he had ever thought Bentham would loom . It was the majesty of the law ; and a person endowed with a nature far less matter - of - fact than that of James might have been excused for failing to pierce this halo , and disinter therefrom the somewhat ordinary Forsyte , who walked and talked in every - day life under the name of Sir Walter Bentham . He delivered judgment in the following words : "
118612	118713	118601	118602	the defendant	5080	" In completing these decorations , the defendant incurred liabilities and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of twelve thousand four hundred pounds , all of which expenditure has been defrayed by the plaintiff . This action has been brought by the plaintiff to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds , alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend . "
118744	118885	118739	118739	he	5080	" What in effect the plaintiff has said is this ' I give you a free hand to complete these decorations , provided that you keep within a total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds . If you exceed that sum by as much as fifty pounds , I will not hold you responsible ; beyond that point you are no agent of mine , and I shall repudiate liability . ' It is not quite clear to me whether , had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent 's contracts , he would , under all the circumstances , have been successful in so doing ; but he has not adopted this course . He has accepted liability , and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant under the terms of the latter 's engagement . "
118901	119005	118739	118739	he	5080	" It has been sought , on behalf of the defendant , to show that no limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this correspondence . If this were so , I can find no reason for the plaintiff 's importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds . The defendant 's contention would render these figures meaningless . It is manifest to me that by his letter of May 20 he assented to a very clear proposition , by the terms of which he must be held to be bound . "
119023	119119	119120	119120	Soames	177	" James sighed , and stooping , picked up his umbrella which had fallen with a rattle at the words ' importation into this correspondence . ' Untangling his legs , he rapidly left the Court ; without waiting for his son , he snapped up a hansom cab it was a clear , grey afternoon and drove straight to Timothy 's where he found Swithin ; and to him , Mrs. Septimus Small , and Aunt Hester , he recounted the whole proceedings , eating two muffins not altogether in the intervals of speech . "
119125	119129	119130	119130	he	2086	" he ended ; "
119167	119188	119189	119189	He	2086	" and then after a long pause , during which he had stared disquietly into the fire , he added : "
119197	119255	119189	119189	He	2086	" There was a sound of footsteps . The figure of a thick - set man , with the ruddy brown face of robust health , was seen in the back drawing - room . The forefinger of his upraised hand was outlined against the black of his frock coat . He spoke in a grudging voice . "
119260	119264	119265	119265	I	0	" he said , "
119274	119293	119269	119269	I	0	" and turning round , he walked out . It was Timothy . James rose from his chair . "
119296	119300	119269	119269	I	0	" he said , "
119310	119536	119540	119541	your wife	1092	" He checked himself , and was silent , staring before him , as though he had seen a portent . CHAPTER VI - SOAMES BREAKS THE NEWS In leaving the Court Soames did not go straight home . He felt disinclined for the City , and drawn by need for sympathy in his triumph , he , too , made his way , but slowly and on foot , to Timothy 's in the Bayswater Road . His father had just left ; Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester , in possession of the whole story , greeted him warmly . They were sure he was hungry after all that evidence . Smither should toast him some more muffins , his dear father had eaten them all . He must put his legs up on the sofa ; and he must have a glass of prune brandy too . It was so strengthening . Swithin was still present , having lingered later than his wo nt , for he felt in want of exercise . On hearing this suggestion , he ' pished . ' A pretty pass young men were coming to ! His own liver was out of order , and he could not bear the thought of anyone else drinking prune brandy . He went away almost immediately , saying to Soames : "
119581	120052	119564	119564	I	0	" Staring down from his height on Soames he contracted his thick , puffy , yellow hand as though squeezing within it all this small fry , and throwing out his chest he waddled slowly away . Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester were left horrified . Swithin was so droll ! They themselves were longing to ask Soames how Irene would take the result , yet knew that they must not ; he would perhaps say something of his own accord , to throw some light on this , the present burning question in their lives , the question that from necessity of silence tortured them almost beyond bearing ; for even Timothy had now been told , and the effect on his health was little short of alarming . And what , too , would June do ? This , also , was a most exciting , if dangerous speculation ! They had never forgotten old Jolyon 's visit , since when he had not once been to see them ; they had never forgotten the feeling it gave all who were present , that the family was no longer what it had been - that the family was breaking up . But Soames gave them no help , sitting with his knees crossed , talking of the Barbizon school of painters , whom he had just discovered . These were the coming men , he said ; he should not wonder if a lot of money were made over them ; he had his eye on two pictures by a man called Corot , charming things ; if he could get them at a reasonable price he was going to buy them - they would , he thought , fetch a big price some day . Interested as they could not but be , neither Mrs. Septimus Small nor Aunt Hester could entirely acquiesce in being thus put off . It was interesting - most interesting - and then Soames was so clever that they were sure he would do something with those pictures if anybody could ; but what was his plan now that he had won his case ; was he going to leave London at once , and live in the country , or what was he going to do ? Soames answered that he did not know , he thought they should be moving soon . He rose and kissed his aunts . No sooner had Aunt Juley received this emblem of departure than a change came over her , as though she were being visited by dreadful courage ; every little roll of flesh on her face seemed trying to escape from an invisible , confining mask . She rose to the full extent of her more than medium height , and said : "
120081	120087	120077	120077	my	0	" Aunt Hester interrupted her : "
120096	120100	120102	120102	your	176	" she gasped - "
120106	120118	120119	120119	I	0	" Mrs. Small went on as though she had not heard : "
120141	120243	120129	120130	Mrs. MacAnder	378	" Aunt Hester , who had also risen , sank back in her chair , and turned her face away . Really Juley was too - she should not do such things when she - Aunt Hester , was in the room ; and , breathless with anticipation , she waited for what Soames would answer . He had flushed the peculiar flush which always centred between his eyes ; lifting his hand , and , as it were , selecting a finger , he bit a nail delicately ; then , drawling it out between set lips , he said : "
120250	120291	120244	120245	Mrs. MacAnder	378	" Without waiting for any reply , he left the room . When he went into Timothy 's he had made up his mind what course to pursue on getting home . He would go up to Irene and say : "
120387	120946	120369	120369	I	0	" Perhaps she would let him kiss her , and forget ! When he came out of Timothy 's his intentions were no longer so simple . The smouldering jealousy and suspicion of months blazed up within him . He would put an end to that sort of thing once and for all ; he would not have her drag his name in the dirt ! If she could not or would not love him , as was her duty and his right - she should not play him tricks with anyone else ! He would tax her with it ; threaten to divorce her ! That would make her behave ; she would never face that . But - but - what if she did ? He was staggered ; this had not occurred to him . What if she did ? What if she made him a confession ? How would he stand then ? He would have to bring a divorce ! A divorce ! Thus close , the word was paralyzing , so utterly at variance with all the principles that had hitherto guided his life . Its lack of compromise appalled him ; he felt - like the captain of a ship , going to the side of his vessel , and , with his own hands throwing over the most precious of his bales . This jettisoning of his property with his own hand seemed uncanny to Soames . It would injure him in his profession : He would have to get rid of the house at Robin Hill , on which he had spent so much money , so much anticipation - and at a sacrifice . And she ! She would no longer belong to him , not even in name ! She would pass out of his life , and he - he should never see her again ! He traversed in the cab the length of a street without getting beyond the thought that he should never see her again ! But perhaps there was nothing to confess , even now very likely there was nothing to confess . Was it wise to push things so far ? Was it wise to put himself into a position where he might have to eat his words ? The result of this case would ruin Bosinney ; a ruined man was desperate , but - what could he do ? He might go abroad , ruined men always went abroad . What could they do - if indeed it was ' they ' - without money ? It would be better to wait and see how things turned out . If necessary , he could have her watched . The agony of his jealousy for all the world like the crisis of an aching tooth came on again ; and he almost cried out . But he must decide , fix on some course of action before he got home . When the cab drew up at the door , he had decided nothing . He entered , pale , his hands moist with perspiration , dreading to meet her , burning to meet her , ignorant of what he was to say or do . The maid Bilson was in the hall , and in answer to his question : "
120952	120989	120949	120950	your mistress	2098	" told him that Mrs. Forsyte had left the house about noon , taking with her a trunk and bag . Snatching the sleeve of his fur coat away from her grasp , he confronted her : "
120992	120996	121000	121000	you	2098	" he exclaimed ; "
121003	121016	121000	121000	you	2098	" Suddenly recollecting that he must not betray emotion , he added : "
121023	121038	121020	121020	she	2098	" and noticed with secret terror the startled look of the maid 's eyes . "
121047	121048	121039	121040	Mrs. Forsyte	189	" "
121068	121777	121062	121062	I	0	" The maid went downstairs , leaving him still in his fur coat , idly turning over the visiting cards in the porcelain bowl that stood on the carved oak rug chest in the hall . Mr. and Mrs. Bareham Culcher . Mrs. Septimus Small . Mrs. Baynes . Mr. Solomon Thornworthy . Lady Bellis . Miss Hermione Bellis . Miss Winifred Bellis . Miss Ella Bellis . Who the devil were all these people ? He seemed to have forgotten all familiar things . The words ' no message - a trunk , and a bag , ' played a hide - and - seek in his brain . It was incredible that she had left no message , and , still in his fur coat , he ran upstairs two steps at a time , as a young married man when he comes home will run up to his wife 's room . Everything was dainty , fresh , sweet - smelling ; everything in perfect order . On the great bed with its lilac silk quilt , was the bag she had made and embroidered with her own hands to hold her sleeping things ; her slippers ready at the foot ; the sheets even turned over at the head as though expecting her . On the table stood the silver - mounted brushes and bottles from her dressing bag , his own present . There must , then , be some mistake . What bag had she taken ? He went to the bell to summon Bilson , but remembered in time that he must assume knowledge of where Irene had gone , take it all as a matter of course , and grope out the meaning for himself . He locked the doors , and tried to think , but felt his brain going round ; and suddenly tears forced themselves into his eyes . Hurriedly pulling off his coat , he looked at himself in the mirror . He was too pale , a greyish tinge all over his face ; he poured out water , and began feverishly washing . Her silver - mounted brushes smelt faintly of the perfumed lotion she used for her hair ; and at this scent the burning sickness of his jealousy seized him again . Struggling into his fur , he ran downstairs and out into the street . He had not lost all command of himself , however , and as he went down Sloane Street he framed a story for use , in case he should not find her at Bosinney 's . But if he should ? His power of decision again failed ; he reached the house without knowing what he should do if he did find her there . It was after office hours , and the street door was closed ; the woman who opened it could not say whether Mr. Bosinney were in or no ; she had not seen him that day , not for two or three days ; she did not attend to him now , nobody attended to him , he .... Soames interrupted her , he would go up and see for himself . He went up with a dogged , white face . The top floor was unlighted , the door closed , no one answered his ringing , he could hear no sound . He was obliged to descend , shivering under his fur , a chill at his heart . Hailing a cab , he told the man to drive to Park Lane . On the way he tried to recollect when he had last given her a cheque ; she could not have more than three or four pounds , but there were her jewels ; and with exquisite torture he remembered how much money she could raise on these ; enough to take them abroad ; enough for them to live on for months ! He tried to calculate ; the cab stopped , and he got out with the calculation unmade . The butler asked whether Mrs. Soames was in the cab , the master had told him they were both expected to dinner . Soames answered : "
121786	121813	121780	121781	Mrs. Forsyte	189	" The butler was sorry . Soames thought he was looking at him inquisitively , and remembering that he was not in dress clothes , asked : "
121821	121822	121819	121819	Warmson	425	" "
121832	121852	121827	121828	Mrs. Dartie	362	" Again it seemed to Soames that the butler was looking curiously at him . His composure gave way . "
121859	121863	121855	121855	you	425	" he said . "
121873	121890	121855	121855	you	425	" The butler blushed , hung up the fur coat , murmured something that sounded like : "
121901	122053	121899	121899	sir	730	" and stealthily withdrew . Soames walked upstairs . Passing the drawing - room without a look , he went straight up to his mother 's and father 's bedroom . James , standing sideways , the concave lines of his tall , lean figure displayed to advantage in shirt - sleeves and evening waistcoat , his head bent , the end of his white tie peeping askew from underneath one white Dundreary whisker , his eyes peering with intense concentration , his lips pouting , was hooking the top hooks of his wife 's bodice . Soames stopped ; he felt half - choked , whether because he had come upstairs too fast , or for some other reason . He - he himself had never - never been asked to .... He heard his father 's voice , as though there were a pin in his mouth , saying : "
122066	122071	121899	121899	sir	730	" His mother 's : "
122087	122101	122104	122104	I	0	" He put his hand up to his throat , and said hoarsely : "
122108	122119	122104	122104	I	0	" He noticed gratefully the affectionate surprise in Emily 's : "
122126	122137	122140	122140	Soames	177	" and James ' , as he dropped the hook : "
122153	122158	122159	122159	I	0	" He answered mechanically : "
122164	122189	122159	122159	I	0	" and looked at them , and it seemed impossible to bring out his news . James , quick to take alarm , began : "
122218	122225	122227	122227	you	754	" But Emily broke in quietly : "
122231	122237	122227	122227	you	754	" Soames shook his head . "
122240	122252	122253	122253	Emily	173	" he stammered , ' she - she 's left me ! "
122283	122292	122293	122293	She	173	" My dear boy ! My dear boy ! "
122322	122326	122327	122327	he	754	" Left you ? "
122330	122349	122327	122327	he	754	" What d'you mean - left you ? You never told me she was going to leave you . "
122354	122366	122350	122350	Soames	177	" How could I tell ? What 's to be done ? "
122385	122392	122393	122393	he	754	" What 's to be done ! "
122396	122475	122393	122393	he	754	" How should I know what 's to be done ? What 's the good of asking me ? Nobody tells me anything , and then they come and ask me what 's to be done ; and I should like to know how I 'm to tell them ! Here 's your mother , there she stands ; she does n't say anything . What I should say you 've got to do is to follow her .. "
122490	122500	122501	122501	he	754	" I do n't know where she 's gone , "
122504	122513	122515	122515	James	173	" Do n't know where she 's gone ! "
122517	122559	122515	122515	James	173	" How d'you mean , do n't know where she 's gone ? Where d'you suppose she 's gone ? She 's gone after that young Bosinney , that 's where she 's gone . I knew how it would be . "
122630	122642	122645	122646	no one	514	" There 'll be a scandal ; I always said so . "
122650	122661	122645	122646	no one	514	" And there you stand , you and your mother ! "
122672	122687	122663	122663	Emily	173	" Come , now , James ! Soames will do all that he can . "
122700	122727	122689	122689	James	173	" Well , I ca n't help you ; I 'm getting old . Do n't you be in too great a hurry , my boy . "
122735	122764	122729	122730	his mother	2511	" Soames will do all he can to get her back . We wo n't talk of it . It 'll all come right , I dare say . "
122768	122813	122766	122766	James	173	" Well , I ca n't see how it can come right . And if she has n't gone off with that young Bosinney , my advice to you is not to listen to her , but to follow her and get her back . "
122846	122850	122840	122840	he	559	" I will ! "
123028	123044	123024	123024	James	173	" Do n't you listen to her , follow - her and get her back ! "
123203	123206	123207	123207	he	2129	" Ah ! "
123210	123244	123207	123207	he	2129	" that 's a clever little chap . I do n't know what 'll become of him , if he goes on like this . An intelligent little chap , I call him ! "
125134	125141	125127	125127	She	186	" What have you come for ? "
125159	125175	125156	125156	her	186	" This horrible case . I came to tell him - he has lost it . "
125195	125208	125191	125192	the girl	595	" Do n't stand there as if you were made of stone ! "
125212	125220	125209	125209	Irene	186	" I wish to God I were ! "
125226	125229	125230	125230	she	166	" Stop ! "
125233	125265	125230	125230	she	166	" do n't tell me ! I do n't want to hear ! I do n't want to hear what you 've come for . I do n't want to hear ! "
125285	125299	125281	125281	she	166	" I was here first . We ca n't both stay here together ! "
125377	125384	125385	125385	she	186	" You have no right here ! "
125392	125399	125389	125389	Irene	186	" I have no right anywhere ! "
125405	125406	125402	125402	you	186	" "
125418	125427	125412	125412	You	186	" June put her hands over her ears . "
125468	125480	125465	125465	you	186	" Irene 's lips moved ; she seemed to be saying : "
125486	125566	125569	125569	you	186	" June turned to the window . She could see the face of a clock down in the street . It was nearly four . At any moment he might come ! She looked back across her shoulder , and her face was distorted with anger . But Irene had not moved ; in her gloved hands she ceaselessly turned and twisted the little bunch of violets . The tears of rage and disappointment rolled down June 's cheeks . "
125572	125576	125569	125569	you	186	" she said . "
125586	125605	125608	125608	you	186	" Again Irene laughed . June saw that she had played a wrong card , and broke down . "
125611	125615	125608	125608	you	186	" she sobbed . "
125630	125658	125624	125624	you	186	" Irene 's mouth quivered ; her eyes met June 's with a look so mournful that the girl cried out in the midst of her sobbing , "
125663	125712	125624	125624	you	186	" But Irene 's head bent till it touched her breast . She turned , and went quickly out , hiding her lips with the little bunch of violets . June ran to the door . She heard the footsteps going down and down . She called out : "
125721	126135	125716	125716	Irene	186	" The footsteps died away .... Bewildered and torn , the girl stood at the top of the stairs . Why had Irene gone , leaving her mistress of the field ? What did it mean ? Had she really given him up to her ? Or had she ... ? And she was the prey of a gnawing uncertainty .... Bosinney did not come .... About six o'clock that afternoon old Jolyon returned from Wistaria Avenue , where now almost every day he spent some hours , and asked if his grand - daughter were upstairs . On being told that she had just come in , he sent up to her room to request her to come down and speak to him . He had made up his mind to tell her that he was reconciled with her father . In future bygones must be bygones . He would no longer live alone , or practically alone , in this great house ; he was going to give it up , and take one in the country for his son , where they could all go and live together . If June did not like this , she could have an allowance and live by herself . It would n't make much difference to her , for it was a long time since she had shown him any affection . But when June came down , her face was pinched and piteous ; there was a strained , pathetic look in her eyes . She snuggled up in her old attitude on the arm of his chair , and what he said compared but poorly with the clear , authoritative , injured statement he had thought out with much care . His heart felt sore , as the great heart of a mother - bird feels sore when its youngling flies and bruises its wing . His words halted , as though he were apologizing for having at last deviated from the path of virtue , and succumbed , in defiance of sounder principles , to his more natural instincts . He seemed nervous lest , in thus announcing his intentions , he should be setting his granddaughter a bad example ; and now that he came to the point , his way of putting the suggestion that , if she did n't like it , she could live by herself and lump it , was delicate in the extreme . ' "
126146	126150	126151	126151	you	1160	" he said , "
126204	126208	126201	126202	the children	3054	" he added , "
126214	126236	126201	126202	the children	3054	" Then , in the midst of this grave , rather transparent , explanation of changed policy , his eyes twinkled . "
126263	126327	126328	126328	You	1160	" June had not yet spoken . Perched thus on the arm of his chair , with her head above him , her face was invisible . But presently he felt her warm cheek against his own , and knew that , at all events , there was nothing very alarming in her attitude towards his news . He began to take courage . "
126334	126338	126339	126341	an amiable chap	2497	" he said - "
126366	126414	126357	126357	You	1160	" And old Jolyon bethought him of the dozen or so water - colour drawings all carefully locked up in his bedroom ; for now that his son was going to become a man of property he did not think them quite such poor things as heretofore . "
126422	126434	126437	126437	her	2195	" he said , using the word with some little difficulty , "
126464	126483	126461	126462	the children	3054	" he repeated - indeed , this sentence ran like music through all his solemn self - justification - "
126489	126555	126461	126462	the children	3054	" If June had known , those words but reincarnated that tender love for little children , for the young and weak , which in the past had made him desert his son for her tiny self , and now , as the cycle rolled , was taking him from her . But he began to get alarmed at her silence , and asked impatiently : "
126563	126816	126560	126560	you	2195	" June slid down to his knee , and she in her turn began her tale . She thought it would all go splendidly ; she did not see any difficulty , and she did not care a bit what people thought . Old Jolyon wriggled . H'm ! then people would think ! He had thought that after all these years perhaps they would n't ! Well , he could n't help it ! Nevertheless , he could not approve of his granddaughter 's way of putting it - she ought to mind what people thought ! Yet he said nothing . His feelings were too mixed , too inconsistent for expression . No - went on June he did not care ; what business was it of theirs ? There was only one thing - and with her cheek pressing against his knee , old Jolyon knew at once that this something was no trifle : As he was going to buy a house in the country , would he not - to please her - buy that splendid house of Soames ' at Robin Hill ? It was finished , it was perfectly beautiful , and no one would live in it now . They would all be so happy there . Old Jolyon was on the alert at once . Was n't the ' man of property ' going to live in his new house , then ? He never alluded to Soames now but under this title . "
126818	126823	126824	126824	he	2198	" - June said - "
126835	126875	126828	126828	she	2199	" How did she know ? She could not tell him , but she knew . She knew nearly for certain ! It was most unlikely ; circumstances had changed ! Irene 's words still rang in her head : "
126886	126997	127001	127001	I	0	" But she kept silence about that . If her grandfather would only buy it and settle that wretched claim that ought never to have been made on Phil ! It would be the very best thing for everybody , and everything - everything might come straight . And June put her lips to his forehead , and pressed them close . But old Jolyon freed himself from her caress , his face wore the judicial look which came upon it when he dealt with affairs . He asked : What did she mean ? There was something behind all this - had she been seeing Bosinney ? June answered : "
127008	127009	127001	127001	I	0	" "
127020	127026	127027	127027	I	0	" June faced him steadily . "
127058	127064	127055	127055	I	0	" Old Jolyon asked again : "
127070	127090	127066	127066	you	0	" His glance seemed to pierce right through the girl 's eyes into her soul . Again June answered : "
127107	127181	127102	127102	he	2200	" Old Jolyon made a movement of relief . She had risen and looked down at him ; so slight , and light , and young , but so fixed , and so determined ; and disturbed , vexed , as he was , he could not frown away that fixed look . The feeling of being beaten , of the reins having slipped , of being old and tired , mastered him . "
127184	127190	127102	127102	he	2200	" he said at last , "
127215	127229	127209	127209	your	0	" Visited by one of his strange bursts of philosophy , he added : "
127246	127304	127309	127309	they	2205	" And he , who in his dealings with men of business , with Boards , with Forsytes of all descriptions , with such as were not Forsytes , had always had his own way , looked at his indomitable grandchild sadly - for he felt in her that quality which above all others he unconsciously admired . "
127315	127323	127309	127309	they	2205	" he said slowly . June crimsoned . "
127342	127349	127350	127350	I	0	" and she stamped her foot . "
127353	127362	127309	127309	they	2205	" said old Jolyon , dropping his eyes , "
127373	127384	127364	127364	you	0	" There was a long silence before he spoke again . "
127402	127430	127397	127397	you	0	" June said that she did . She knew that he could get it if he wanted . He would only have to give what it cost . "
127460	127461	127448	127448	I	0	" "
127511	127521	127502	127502	You	0	" A twinkle came into old Jolyon 's eyes . "
127545	127814	127536	127536	you	0	" But secretly , the idea of wresting the house from James and his son had begun to take hold of him . He had heard on Forsyte ' Change much comment , much rather doubtful praise of this house . It was ' too artistic , ' but a fine place . To take from the ' man of property ' that on which he had set his heart , would be a crowning triumph over James , practical proof that he was going to make a man of property of Jo , to put him back in his proper position , and there to keep him secure . Justice once for all on those who had chosen to regard his son as a poor , penniless outcast . He would see , he would see ! It might be out of the question ; he was not going to pay a fancy price , but if it could be done , why , perhaps he would do it ! And still more secretly he knew that he could not refuse her . But he did not commit himself . He would think it over - he said to June . CHAPTER VIII - BOSINNEY 'S DEPARTURE Old Jolyon was not given to hasty decisions ; it is probable that he would have continued to think over the purchase of the house at Robin Hill , had not June 's face told him that he would have no peace until he acted . At breakfast next morning she asked him what time she should order the carriage . "
127817	127827	127536	127536	you	0	" he said , with some appearance of innocence ; "
127837	127841	127831	127831	I	0	" She answered : "
127862	127863	127864	127864	James	241	" "
127872	127873	127870	127870	James	241	" "
127877	127892	127870	127870	James	241	" she replied , in such a voice that he no longer pretended ignorance . "
127901	127905	127906	127906	You	0	" he said . "
127920	127926	127914	127914	Gran	353	" Old Jolyon grumbled out : "
127966	128050	128055	128055	he	2214	" At a quarter past he was placing his umbrella in the stand at Park Lane - he did not choose to relinquish his hat and coat ; telling Warmson that he wanted to see his master , he went , without being announced , into the study , and sat down . James was still in the dining - room talking to Soames , who had come round again before breakfast . On hearing who his visitor was , he muttered nervously : "
128061	128067	128058	128058	I	0	" He then got up . "
128070	128076	128058	128058	I	0	" he said to Soames , "
128123	128136	128137	128139	Poor little thing	2219	" And suddenly moved to strange softness , he muttered to himself , "
128151	128201	128141	128141	I	0	" and went out blowing his nose . Old Jolyon did not rise on seeing his brother , but held out his hand , and exchanged with him the clasp of a Forsyte . James took another chair by the table , and leaned his head on his hand . "
128204	128208	128141	128141	I	0	" he said , "
128222	128232	128213	128213	We	2221	" Old Jolyon paid no attention to the remark . "
128237	128249	128235	128235	Emily	173	" he asked ; and waiting for no reply , went on "
128277	128278	128264	128264	I	0	" "
128289	128293	128279	128279	I	0	" said James , "
128311	128325	128303	128303	I	0	" Old Jolyon was not slow to seize the opportunity this gave him . "
128333	128337	128303	128303	I	0	" he agreed ; "
128378	128394	128395	128395	I	0	" Seeing both surprise and suspicion in James ' eye , he quickly went on : "
128458	128585	128586	128586	They	2228	" James listened to this statement with a strange mixture of doubt , suspicion , and relief , merging into a dread of something behind , and tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance upon his elder brother 's good faith and judgment . There was anxiety , too , as to what old Jolyon could have heard and how he had heard it ; and a sort of hopefulness arising from the thought that if June 's connection with Bosinney were completely at an end , her grandfather would hardly seem anxious to help the young fellow . Altogether he was puzzled ; as he did not like either to show this , or to commit himself in any way , he said : "
128600	128646	128586	128586	They	2228	" He had not been told this ; he had merely added the fact of having seen old Jolyon with his son and grandchildren to the fact that he had taken his Will away from Forsyte , Bustard and Forsyte . The shot went home . "
128652	128657	128658	128658	I	0	" asked old Jolyon . "
128666	128670	128661	128661	I	0	" said James ; "
128706	128707	128692	128692	he	164	" "
128710	128715	128718	128718	he	164	" said old Jolyon , "
128777	128790	128774	128774	I	0	" James , who was secretly also of this opinion , answered : "
128810	128811	128798	128798	Soames	164	" "
128814	128819	128798	128798	Soames	164	" said old Jolyon , "
128850	128906	128920	128920	Soames	164	" James was a little cowed ; when it came to the actual figures of a commercial transaction he was sure of himself , for then he was dealing with facts , not with men ; but preliminary negotiations such as these made him nervous - he never knew quite how far he could go . "
128909	128913	128920	128920	Soames	164	" he said , "
128942	128943	128922	128922	he	164	" "
128946	128951	128922	128922	he	164	" said old Jolyon , "
128962	128982	128955	128955	him	164	" He placed his hat on his head in dudgeon . The door was opened and Soames came in . "
128990	128998	128985	128986	a policeman	2236	" he said with his half smile , "
129003	129015	129016	129017	A policeman	2236	" Old Jolyon looked at him angrily , and James said : "
129037	129049	129031	129031	you	271	" he added to old Jolyon with a look of suspicion : "
129058	129095	129052	129052	you	271	" In the hall an Inspector of Police stood stolidly regarding with heavy - lidded pale - blue eyes the fine old English furniture picked up by James at the famous Mavrojano sale in Portman Square . "
129104	129134	129096	129096	You	271	" said James . The Inspector raised his fingers respectfully to his peaked cap , and entered the study . James saw him go in with a strange sensation . "
129137	129143	129144	129144	I	0	" he said to Soames , "
129164	129180	129155	129156	Your uncle	994	" He returned with Soames into the dining - room , but could not rest . "
129187	129192	129184	129184	he	2239	" he murmured again . "
129195	129199	129200	129201	the Inspector	5308	" replied Soames : "
129234	129308	129229	129229	I	0	" But in spite of his calmness , he too was ill at ease . At the end of ten minutes old Jolyon came in . He walked up to the table , and stood there perfectly silent pulling at his long white moustaches . James gazed up at him with opening mouth ; he had never seen his brother look like this . Old Jolyon raised his hand , and said slowly : "
129321	129341	129309	129310	Young Bosinney	168	" Then standing above his brother and his nephew , and looking down at him with his deep eyes : "
129353	129362	129309	129310	Young Bosinney	168	" he said . James ' jaw dropped . "
129372	129378	129367	129367	he	168	" Old Jolyon answered sternly : "
129390	129561	129367	129367	he	168	" But James did not reply . For all men of great age , even for all Forsytes , life has had bitter experiences . The passer - by , who sees them wrapped in cloaks of custom , wealth , and comfort , would never suspect that such black shadows had fallen on their roads . To every man of great age - to Sir Walter Bentham himself - the idea of suicide has once at least been present in the ante - room of his soul ; on the threshold , waiting to enter , held out from the inmost chamber by some chance reality , some vague fear , some painful hope . To Forsytes that final renunciation of property is hard . Oh ! it is hard ! Seldom - perhaps never - can they achieve , it ; and yet , how near have they not sometimes been ! So even with James ! Then in the medley of his thoughts , he broke out : "
129586	129683	129684	129684	Death	433	" He turned from one face to the other in his confusion of soul ; but instinctively all the time he was rejecting that rumour of suicide . He dared not entertain this thought , so against his interest , against the interest of his son , of every Forsyte . He strove against it ; and as his nature ever unconsciously rejected that which it could not with safety accept , so gradually he overcame this fear . It was an accident ! It must have been ! Old Jolyon broke in on his reverie . "
129722	129959	129713	129713	you	2251	" No one opposing this command he led the way from the room . The day was still and clear and bright , and driving over to Park Lane from Stanhope Gate , old Jolyon had had the carriage open . Sitting back on the padded cushions , finishing his cigar , he had noticed with pleasure the keen crispness of the air , the bustle of the cabs and people ; the strange , almost Parisian , alacrity that the first fine day will bring into London streets after a spell of fog or rain . And he had felt so happy ; he had not felt like it for months . His confession to June was off his mind ; he had the prospect of his son 's , above all , of his grandchildren 's company in the future - he had appointed to meet young Jolyon at the Hotch Potch that very manning to - discuss it again ; and there was the pleasurable excitement of a coming encounter , a coming victory , over James and the ' man of property ' in the matter of the house . He had the carriage closed now ; he had no heart to look on gaiety ; nor was it right that Forsytes should be seen driving with an Inspector of Police . In that carriage the Inspector spoke again of the death : "
130032	130359	130558	130559	the gentleman	2254	" his cold blue eyes travelled from one to another of the three Forsytes in the carriage . Old Jolyon watching from his corner saw his brother 's face change , and the brooding , worried , look deepen on it . At the Inspector 's words , indeed , all James ' doubts and fears revived . Hard - up - pawn - tickets - an overdrawn account ! These words that had all his life been a far - off nightmare to him , seemed to make uncannily real that suspicion of suicide which must on no account be entertained . He sought his son 's eye ; but lynx - eyed , taciturn , immovable , Soames gave no answering look . And to old Jolyon watching , divining the league of mutual defence between them , there came an overmastering desire to have his own son at his side , as though this visit to the dead man 's body was a battle in which otherwise he must single - handed meet those two . And the thought of how to keep June 's name out of the business kept whirring in his brain . James had his son to support him ! Why should he not send for Jo ? Taking out his card - case , he pencilled the following message : ' Come round at once . I 've sent the carriage for you . ' On getting out he gave this card to his coachman , telling him to drive - as fast as possible to the Hotch Potch Club , and if Mr. Jolyon Forsyte were there to give him the card and bring him at once . If not there yet , he was to wait till he came . He followed the others slowly up the steps , leaning on his umbrella , and stood a moment to get his breath . The Inspector said : "
130372	130555	130556	130556	You	730	" In the bare , white - walled room , empty of all but a streak of sunshine smeared along the dustless floor , lay a form covered by a sheet . With a huge steady hand the Inspector took the hem and turned it back . A sightless face gazed up at them , and on either side of that sightless defiant face the three Forsytes gazed down ; in each one of them the secret emotions , fears , and pity of his own nature rose and fell like the rising , falling waves of life , whose wish those white walls barred out now for ever from Bosinney . And in each one of them the trend of his nature , the odd essential spring , which moved him in fashions minutely , unalterably different from those of every other human being , forced him to a different attitude of thought . Far from the others , yet inscrutably close , each stood thus , alone with death , silent , his eyes lowered . The Inspector asked softly : "
130563	130747	130561	130561	sir	730	" Old Jolyon raised his head and nodded . He looked at his brother opposite , at that long lean figure brooding over the dead man , with face dusky red , and strained grey eyes ; and at the figure of Soames white and still by his father 's side . And all that he had felt against those two was gone like smoke in the long white presence of Death . Whence comes it , how comes it - Death ? Sudden reverse of all that goes before ; blind setting forth on a path that leads to where ? Dark quenching of the fire ! The heavy , brutal crushing - out that all men must go through , keeping their eyes clear and brave unto the end ! Small and of no import , insects though they are ! And across old Jolyon 's face there flitted a gleam , for Soames , murmuring to the Inspector , crept noiselessly away . Then suddenly James raised his eyes . There was a queer appeal in that suspicious troubled look : "
130757	130968	130750	130750	I	0	" it seemed to say . And , hunting for handkerchief he wiped his brow ; then , bending sorrowful and lank over the dead man , he too turned and hurried out . Old Jolyon stood , still as death , his eyes fixed on the body . Who shall tell of what he was thinking ? Of himself , when his hair was brown like the hair of that young fellow dead before him ? Of himself , with his battle just beginning , the long , long battle he had loved ; the battle that was over for this young man almost before it had begun ? Of his grand - daughter , with her broken hopes ? Of that other woman ? Of the strangeness , and the pity of it ? And the irony , inscrutable , and bitter of that end ? Justice ! There was no justice for men , for they were ever in the dark ! Or perhaps in his philosophy he thought : Better to be out of , it all ! Better to have done with it , like this poor youth .... Some one touched him on the arm . A tear started up and wetted his eyelash . "
130971	130975	130976	130976	I	0	" he said , "
131001	131150	130988	130988	You	2263	" and with his head bowed he went away . It was young Jolyon 's turn to take his stand beside the dead man , round whose fallen body he seemed to see all the Forsytes breathless , and prostrated . The stroke had fallen too swiftly . The forces underlying every tragedy - forces that take no denial , working through cross currents to their ironical end , had met and fused with a thunder - clap , flung out the victim , and flattened to the ground all those that stood around . Or so at all events young Jolyon seemed to see them , lying around Bosinney 's body . He asked the Inspector to tell him what had happened , and the latter , like a man who does not every day get such a chance , again detailed such facts as were known . "
131160	131164	131156	131156	sir	730	" he said , "
131218	131279	131210	131210	you	730	" He took from his pocket a little packet and laid it on the table . Carefully undoing it , he revealed a lady 's handkerchief , pinned through the folds with a pin of discoloured Venetian gold , the stone of which had fallen from the socket . A scent of dried violets rose to young Jolyon 's nostrils . "
131286	131291	131210	131210	you	730	" said the Inspector ; "
131299	131306	131307	131307	I	0	" Young Jolyon with difficulty answered : "
131316	131821	131824	131824	Jo	190	" But vividly there rose before him the face he had seen light up , so tremulous and glad , at Bosinney 's coming ! Of her he thought more than of his own daughter , more than of them all - of her with the dark , soft glance , the delicate passive face , waiting for the dead man , waiting even at that moment , perhaps , still and patient in the sunlight . He walked sorrowfully away from the hospital towards his father 's house , reflecting that this death would break up the Forsyte family . The stroke had indeed slipped past their defences into the very wood of their tree . They might flourish to all appearance as before , preserving a brave show before the eyes of London , but the trunk was dead , withered by the same flash that had stricken down Bosinney . And now the saplings would take its place , each one a new custodian of the sense of property . Good forest of Forsytes ! thought young Jolyon - soundest timber of our land ! Concerning the cause of this death - his family would doubtless reject with vigour the suspicion of suicide , which was so compromising ! They would take it as an accident , a stroke of fate . In their hearts they would even feel it an intervention of Providence , a retribution - had not Bosinney endangered their two most priceless possessions , the pocket and the hearth ? And they would talk of ' that unfortunate accident of young Bosinney 's , ' but perhaps they would not talk - silence might be better ! As for himself , he regarded the bus - driver 's account of the accident as of very little value . For no one so madly in love committed suicide for want of money ; nor was Bosinney the sort of fellow to set much store by a financial crisis . And so he too rejected this theory of suicide , the dead man 's face rose too clearly before him . Gone in the heyday of his summer - and to believe thus that an accident had cut Bosinney off in the full sweep of his passion was more than ever pitiful to young Jolyon . Then came a vision of Soames ' home as it now was , and must be hereafter . The streak of lightning had flashed its clear uncanny gleam on bare bones with grinning spaces between , the disguising flesh was gone .... In the dining - room at Stanhope Gate old Jolyon was sitting alone when his son came in . He looked very wan in his great armchair . And his eyes travelling round the walls with their pictures of still life , and the masterpiece ' Dutch fishing - boats at Sunset ' seemed as though passing their gaze over his life with its hopes , its gains , its achievements . "
131826	131830	131833	131833	you	190	" he said , "
131886	132241	131869	131869	I	0	" And holding up his thin , veined hand , he clenched it . CHAPTER IX - IRENE 'S RETURN After leaving James and old Jolyon in the mortuary of the hospital , Soames hurried aimlessly along the streets . The tragic event of Bosinney 's death altered the complexion of everything . There was no longer the same feeling that to lose a minute would be fatal , nor would he now risk communicating the fact of his wife 's flight to anyone till the inquest was over . That morning he had risen early , before the postman came , had taken the first - post letters from the box himself , and , though there had been none from Irene , he had made an opportunity of telling Bilson that her mistress was at the sea ; he would probably , he said , be going down himself from Saturday to Monday . This had given him time to breathe , time to leave no stone unturned to find her . But now , cut off from taking steps by Bosinney 's death - that strange death , to think of which was like putting a hot iron to his heart , like lifting a great weight from it - he did not know how to pass his day ; and he wandered here and there through the streets , looking at every face he met , devoured by a hundred anxieties . And as he wandered , he thought of him who had finished his wandering , his prowling , and would never haunt his house again . Already in the afternoon he passed posters announcing the identity of the dead man , and bought the papers to see what they said . He would stop their mouths if he could , and he went into the City , and was closeted with Boulter for a long time . On his way home , passing the steps of Jobson 's about half past four , he met George Forsyte , who held out an evening paper to Soames , saying : "
132253	132258	132245	132245	you	2266	" Soames answered stonily : "
132261	132360	132245	132245	you	2266	" George stared at him . He had never liked Soames ; he now held him responsible for Bosinney 's death . Soames had done for him - done for him by that act of property that had sent the Buccaneer to run amok that fatal afternoon . ' The poor fellow , ' he was thinking , ' was so cracked with jealousy , so cracked for his vengeance , that he heard nothing of the omnibus in that infernal fog . ' Soames had done for him ! And this judgment was in George 's eyes . "
132367	132373	132361	132361	They	2267	" he said at last . "
132380	132386	132361	132361	They	2267	" Soames shook his head . "
132390	132416	132361	132361	They	2267	" he muttered . Clenching his fist on the paper , George crammed it into his pocket . He could not resist a parting shot . "
132429	132567	132426	132426	Soameses	434	" With a face as white as the steps of Jobson 's , and a lip raised as if snarling , Soames brushed past him and was gone .... On reaching home , and entering the little lighted hall with his latchkey , the first thing that caught his eye was his wife 's gold - mounted umbrella lying on the rug chest . Flinging off his fur coat , he hurried to the drawing - room . The curtains were drawn for the night , a bright fire of cedar - logs burned in the grate , and by its light he saw Irene sitting in her usual corner on the sofa . He shut the door softly , and went towards her . She did not move , and did not seem to see him . "
132574	132578	132569	132569	you	2269	" he said . "
132588	132706	132581	132581	you	2269	" Then he caught sight of her face , so white and motionless that it seemed as though the blood must have stopped flowing in her veins ; and her eyes , that looked enormous , like the great , wide , startled brown eyes of an owl . Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions , she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl , bunched fir its soft feathers against the wires of a cage . The supple erectness of her figure was gone , as though she had been broken by cruel exercise ; as though there were no longer any reason for being beautiful , and supple , and erect . "
132713	132870	132708	132708	you	2269	" he repeated . She never looked up , and never spoke , the firelight playing over her motionless figure . Suddenly she tried to rise , but he prevented her ; it was then that he understood . She had come back like an animal wounded to death , not knowing where to turn , not knowing what she was doing . The sight of her figure , huddled in the fur , was enough . He knew then for certain that Bosinney had been her lover ; knew that she had seen the report of his death - perhaps , like himself , had bought a paper at the draughty corner of a street , and read it . She had come back then of her own accord , to the cage she had pined to be free of - and taking in all the tremendous significance of this , he longed to cry : "
132915	132987	132708	132708	you	2269	" And , at those unspoken words , he seemed to see her rise and move away , like a woman in a terrible dream , from which she was fighting to awake - rise and go out into the dark and cold , without a thought of him , without so much as the knowledge of his presence . Then he cried , contradicting what he had not yet spoken , "
132993	133734	132708	132708	you	2269	" And turning away from her , he sat down in his accustomed chair on the other side of the hearth . They sat in silence . And Soames thought : ' Why is all this ? Why should I suffer so ? What have I done ? It is not my fault ! ' Again he looked at her , huddled like a bird that is shot and dying , whose poor breast you see panting as the air is taken from it , whose poor eyes look at you who have shot it , with a slow , soft , unseeing look , taking farewell of all that is good - of the sun , and the air , and its mate . So they sat , by the firelight , in the silence , one on each side of the hearth . And the fume of the burning cedar logs , that he loved so well , seemed to grip Soames by the throat till he could bear it no longer . And going out into the hall he flung the door wide , to gulp down the cold air that came in ; then without hat or overcoat went out into the Square . Along the garden rails a half - starved cat came rubbing her way towards him , and Soames thought : ' Suffering ! when will it cease , my suffering ? ' At a front door across the way was a man of his acquaintance named Rutter , scraping his boots , with an air of ' I am master here . ' And Soames walked on . From far in the clear air the bells of the church where he and Irene had been married were pealing in ' practice ' for the advent of Christ , the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic . He felt a craving for strong drink , to lull him to indifference , or rouse him to fury . If only he could burst out of himself , out of this web that for the first time in his life he felt around him . If only he could surrender to the thought : ' Divorce her - turn her out ! She has forgotten you . Forget her ! ' If only he could surrender to the thought : ' Let her go - she has suffered enough ! ' If only he could surrender to the desire : ' Make a slave of her - she is in your power ! ' If only even he could surrender to the sudden vision : ' What does it all matter ? ' Forget himself for a minute , forget that it mattered what he did , forget that whatever he did he must sacrifice something . If only he could act on an impulse ! He could forget nothing ; surrender to no thought , vision , or desire ; it was all too serious ; too close around him , an unbreakable cage . On the far side of the Square newspaper boys were calling their evening wares , and the ghoulish cries mingled and jangled with the sound of those church bells . Soames covered his ears . The thought flashed across him that but for a chance , he himself , and not Bosinney , might be lying dead , and she , instead of crouching there like a shot bird with those dying eyes .... Something soft touched his legs , the cat was rubbing herself against them . And a sob that shook him from head to foot burst from Soames ' chest . Then all was still again in the dark , where the houses seemed to stare at him , each with a master and mistress of its own , and a secret story of happiness or sorrow . And suddenly he saw that his own door was open , and black against the light from the hall a man standing with his back turned . Something slid too in his breast , and he stole up close behind . He could see his own fur coat flung across the carved oak chair ; the Persian rugs ; the silver bowls , the rows of porcelain plates arranged along the walls , and this unknown man who was standing there . And sharply he asked : "
133743	133753	133741	133741	sir	730	" The visitor turned . It was young Jolyon . "
133759	133763	133741	133741	sir	730	" he said . "
133780	133790	133791	133791	My	0	" Soames gave him a strange , sidelong stare . "
133798	133808	133791	133791	My	0	" he muttered doggedly . Young Jolyon answered gently : "
133817	133827	133828	133828	She	1092	" Soames brushed by him and barred the way . "
133834	133945	133828	133828	She	1092	" he said again . Young Jolyon 's glance shot past him into the hall , and Soames turned . There in the drawing - room doorway stood Irene , her eyes were wild and eager , her lips were parted , her hands outstretched . In the sight of both men that light vanished from her face ; her hands dropped to her sides ; she stood like stone . Soames spun round , and met his visitor 's eyes , and at the look he saw in them , a sound like a snarl escaped him . He drew his lips back in the ghost of a smile . "
133951	133955	133956	133956	I	0	" he said ; "
