243	248	250	254	the man with the basket	449	" Good night t'ee , "
256	263	265	266	the parson	450	" Good night , Sir John , "
283	328	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" Now , sir , begging your pardon ; we met last market - day on this road about this time , and I said ' Good night , ' and you made reply ' Good night , Sir John , ' as now . "
329	333	335	336	the parson	450	" I did , "
338	349	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" And once before that - near a month ago . "
350	355	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" I may have . "
356	384	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" Then what might your meaning be in calling me ' Sir John ' these different times , when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield , the haggler ? "
394	401	402	402	he	450	" It was only my whim , "
413	504	402	402	he	450	" It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago , whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history . I am Parson Tringham , the antiquary , of Stagfoot Lane . Do n't you really know , Durbeyfield , that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles , who derive their descent from Sir Pagan d'Urberville , that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror , as appears by Battle Abbey Roll ? "
505	513	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" Never heard it before , sir ! "
514	725	402	402	he	450	" Well it 's true . Throw up your chin a moment , so that I may catch the profile of your face better . Yes , that 's the d'Urberville nose and chin - a little debased . Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire . Branches of your family held manors over all this part of England ; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen . In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers ; and in Edward the Second 's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there . You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell 's time , but to no serious extent , and in Charles the Second 's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty . Aye , there have been generations of Sir Johns among you , and if knighthood were hereditary , like a baronetcy , as it practically was in old times , when men were knighted from father to son , you would be Sir John now . "
726	733	268	275	The pedestrian , after another pace or two	451	" Ye do n't say so ! "
734	738	740	741	the parson	450	" In short , "
751	761	740	741	the parson	450	" there 's hardly such another family in England . "
762	772	774	774	Durbeyfield	180	" Daze my eyes , and is n't there ? "
776	822	774	774	Durbeyfield	180	" And here have I been knocking about , year after year , from pillar to post , as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish ... And how long hev this news about me been knowed , Pa'son Tringham ? "
912	929	931	931	he	455	" At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information , "
933	959	931	931	he	455	" However , our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes . I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while . "
960	1109	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" Well , I have heard once or twice , ' tis true , that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor . But I took no notice o't , thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one . I 've got a wold silver spoon , and a wold graven seal at home , too ; but , Lord , what 's a spoon and seal ? ... And to think that I and these noble d'Urbervilles were one flesh all the time . ' Twas said that my gr't - granfer had secrets , and did n't care to talk of where he came from ... And where do we raise our smoke , now , parson , if I may make so bold ; I mean , where do we d'Urbervilles live ? "
1110	1126	931	931	he	455	" You do n't live anywhere . You are extinct - as a county family . "
1127	1132	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" That 's bad . "
1133	1157	931	931	he	455	" Yes - what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line - that is , gone down - gone under . "
1158	1165	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" Then where do we lie ? "
1166	1192	931	931	he	455	" At Kingsbere - sub - Greenhill : rows and rows of you in your vaults , with your effigies under Purbeck - marble canopies . "
1193	1203	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" And where be our family mansions and estates ? "
1204	1210	931	931	he	455	" You have n't any . "
1211	1218	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" Oh ? No lands neither ? "
1219	1274	931	931	he	455	" None ; though you once had 'em in abundance , as I said , for you family consisted of numerous branches . In this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere , and another at Sherton , and another in Millpond , and another at Lullstead , and another at Wellbridge . "
1275	1286	883	883	Durbeyfield	180	" And shall we ever come into our own again ? "
1287	1296	931	931	he	455	" Ah - that I ca n't tell ! "
1297	1309	1311	1311	Durbeyfield	180	" And what had I better do about it , sir ? "
1317	1374	931	931	he	455	" Oh - nothing , nothing ; except chasten yourself with the thought of ' how are the mighty fallen . ' It is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist , nothing more . There are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre . Good night . "
1375	1425	931	931	he	455	" But you 'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi ' me on the strength o't , Pa'son Tringham ? There 's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop - though , to be sure , not so good as at Rolliver 's . "
1426	1444	931	931	he	455	" No , thank you - not this evening , Durbeyfield . You 've had enough already . "
1549	1569	1527	1528	The latter	462	" Boy , take up that basket ! I want ' ee to go on an errand for me . "
1577	1609	1570	1574	The lath - like stripling	464	" Who be you , then , John Durbeyfield , to order me about and call me ' boy ' ? You know my name as well as I know yours ! "
1610	1682	1685	1685	he	465	" Do you , do you ? That 's the secret - that 's the secret ! Now obey my orders , and take the message I 'm going to charge ' ee wi ' ... Well , Fred , I do n't mind telling you that the secret is that I 'm one of a noble race - it has been just found out by me this present afternoon , P.M. "
1724	1735	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Sir John d'Urberville - that 's who I am , "
1741	1778	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" That is if knights were baronets - which they be . ' Tis recorded in history all about me . Dost know of such a place , lad , as Kingsbere - sub - Greenhill ? "
1779	1790	1685	1685	he	465	" Ees . I 've been there to Greenhill Fair . "
1791	1803	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Well , under the church of that city there lie - "
1804	1838	1685	1685	he	465	" ' Tisn't a city , the place I mean ; leastwise ' twaddn ' when I was there - ' twas a little one - eyed , blinking sort o ' place . "
1839	1912	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Never you mind the place , boy , that 's not the question before us . Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors - hundreds of 'em - in coats of mail and jewels , in gr't lead coffins weighing tons and tons . There 's not a man in the county o ' South - Wessex that 's got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I. "
1913	1916	1685	1685	he	465	" Oh ? "
1917	2035	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Now take up that basket , and goo on to Marlott , and when you 've come to The Pure Drop Inn , tell 'em to send a horse and carriage to me immed'ately , to carry me hwome . And in the bottom o ' the carriage they be to put a noggin o ' rum in a small bottle , and chalk it up to my account . And when you 've done that goo on to my house with the basket , and tell my wife to put away that washing , because she need n't finish it , and wait till I come hwome , as I 've news to tell her . "
2067	2076	2203	2203	Durbeyfield	180	" Here 's for your labour , lad . "
2091	2113	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Yes , Sir John . Thank ' ee . Anything else I can do for ' ee , Sir John ? "
2114	2161	2050	2050	his	470	" Tell 'em at hwome that I should like for supper , - well , lamb 's fry if they can get it ; and if they ca n't , black - pot ; and if they ca n't get that , well chitterlings will do . "
2162	2168	1737	1739	the prostrate man	468	" Yes , Sir John . "
2196	2201	2203	2203	Durbeyfield	180	" What 's that ? "
2205	2213	2203	2203	Durbeyfield	180	" Not on account o ' I ? "
2214	2238	2050	2050	his	470	" ' Tis the women 's club - walking , Sir John . Why , your da'ter is one o ' the members . "
2239	2282	2203	2203	Durbeyfield	180	" To be sure - I 'd quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things ! Well , vamp on to Marlott , will ye , and order that carriage , and maybe I 'll drive round and inspect the club . "
2903	2908	2921	2925	the younger inhabitants of Marlott	510	" club - walking , "
3338	3346	3334	3334	she	529	" I have no pleasure in them , "
3588	3613	3582	3585	one of the women	545	" The Load - a - Lord ! Why , Tess Durbeyfield , if there is n't thy father riding hwome in a carriage ! "
3775	3805	3762	3762	his	554	" I 've -got - a - gr't - family - vault - at - Kingsbere - and knighted - forefathers - in - lead - coffins - there ! "
3838	3847	3848	3848	she	198	" He 's tired , that 's all , "
3852	3872	3848	3848	she	198	" and he has got a lift home , because our own horse has to rest to - day . "
3873	3880	3882	3883	her companions	558	" Bless thy simplicity , Tess , "
3885	3898	3882	3883	her companions	558	" He 's got his market - nitch . Haw - haw ! "
3899	3920	3921	3921	Tess	198	" Look here ; I wo n't walk another inch with you , if you say any jokes about him ! "
4650	4660	4662	4663	the eldest	587	" What are you going to do , Angel ? "
4665	4698	4627	4627	He	604	" I am inclined to go and have a fling with them . Why not all of us - just for a minute or two - it will not detain us long ? "
4699	4706	4708	4709	the first	606	" No - no ; nonsense ! "
4711	4784	4708	4709	the first	606	" Dancing in public with a troop of country hoydens - suppose we should be seen ! Come along , or it will be dark before we get to Stourcastle , and there 's no place we can sleep at nearer than that ; besides , we must get through another chapter of A Counterblast to Agnosticism before we turn in , now I have taken the trouble to bring the book . "
4785	4813	4819	4819	him	606	" All right - I 'll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes ; do n't stop ; I give my word that I will , Felix . "
4842	4849	4850	4850	he	606	" This is a thousand pities , "
4875	4884	4850	4850	he	606	" Where are your partners , my dears ? "
4885	4894	4836	4837	the youngest	609	" They 've not left off work yet , "
4901	4920	4836	4837	the youngest	609	" They 'll be here by and by . Till then , will you be one , sir ? "
4921	4932	4850	4850	he	606	" Certainly . But what 's one among so many ! "
4933	4967	4836	4837	the youngest	609	" Better than none . ' Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of your own sort , and no clipsing and colling at all . Now , pick and choose . "
4968	4978	4980	4982	a shyer girl	613	" ' Ssh - do n't be so for'ard ! "
5655	5672	5653	5653	she	636	" the soft torments , the bitter sweets , the pleasing pains , and the agreeable distresses "

6481	6504	6477	6478	the daughter	676	" Or I 'll take off my best frock and help you wring up ? I thought you had finished long ago . "
6602	6612	6613	6614	her mother	658	" Well , I 'm glad you 've come , "
6629	6667	6613	6614	her mother	658	" I want to go and fetch your father ; but what 's more'n that , I want to tell ' ee what have happened . Y'll be fess enough , my poppet , when th'st know ! "
6717	6724	6725	6725	Tess	198	" Since I 've been away ? "
6728	6731	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" Ay ! "
6732	6769	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" Had it anything to do with father 's making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon ? Why did ' er ? I felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame ! "
6770	6887	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" That wer all a part of the larry ! We 've been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county - reaching all back long before Oliver Grumble 's time - to the days of the Pagan Turks - with monuments , and vaults , and crests , and ' scutcheons , and the Lord knows what all . In Saint Charles 's days we was made Knights o ' the Royal Oak , our real name being d'Urberville ! ... Do n't that make your bosom plim ? ' Twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee ; not because he 'd been drinking , as people supposed . "
6888	6904	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" I 'm glad of that . Will it do us any good , mother ? "
6905	6967	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" O yes ! ' Tis thoughted that great things may come o't . No doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as ' tis known . Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston , and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter . "
6968	6974	6976	6976	Tess	198	" Where is father now ? "
6989	7030	6979	6980	Her mother	658	" He called to see the doctor to - day in Shaston . It is not consumption at all , it seems . It is fat round his heart , ' a says . There , it is like this . "
7061	7111	7113	7114	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" ' At the present moment , ' he says to your father , ' your heart is enclosed all round there , and all round there ; this space is still open , ' ' a says . ' As soon as it do meet , so , ' "
7123	7161	7113	7114	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" ' off you will go like a shadder , Mr Durbeyfield , ' ' a says . ' You mid last ten years ; you mid go off in ten months , or ten days . ' "
7183	7189	7190	7190	she	198	" But where IS father ? "
7202	7289	7194	7195	Her mother	658	" Now do n't you be bursting out angry ! The poor man - he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pa'son 's news - that he went up to Rolliver 's half an hour ago . He do want to get up his strength for his journey to - morrow with that load of beehives , which must be delivered , family or no . He 'll have to start shortly after twelve to - night , as the distance is so long . "
7290	7296	7298	7298	Tess	198	" Get up his strength ! "
7308	7335	7298	7298	Tess	198	" O my God ! Go to a public - house to get up his strength ! And you as well agreed as he , mother ! "
7373	7376	7378	7379	the latter	462	" No , "
7382	7406	7378	7379	the latter	462	" I be not agreed . I have been waiting for ' ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him . "
7407	7412	7437	7438	her mother	658	" I 'll go . "
7413	7428	7378	7379	the latter	462	" O no , Tess . You see , it would be no use . "
7479	7491	7492	7492	Joan	205	" And take the Compleat Fortune - Teller to the outhouse , "

8331	8362	8324	8324	she	198	" do you put on your hat - you bain't afraid ? - and go up to Rolliver 's , and see what has gone wi ' father and mother . "
8417	8423	8424	8424	she	198	" I must go myself , "
8809	8811	8789	8792	a couple more men	780	" cwoffer "
9015	9037	9057	9057	she	180	" - Being a few private friends I 've asked in to keep up club - walking at my own expense , "
9063	9092	9057	9057	she	180	" Oh , ' tis you , Mrs Durbeyfield - Lard - how you frightened me ! - I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover'ment . "
9128	9163	9116	9116	He	791	" I be as good as some folks here and there ! I 've got a great family vault at Kingsbere - sub - Greenhill , and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex ! "
9164	9185	9187	9189	his cheerful wife	792	" I 've something to tell ' ee that 's come into my head about that - a grand projick ! "
9191	9203	9204	9204	She	792	" Here , John , do n't ' ee see me ? "
9227	9242	9244	9245	the landlady	763	" Hush ! Do n't ' ee sing so loud , my good man , "
9247	9265	9244	9245	the landlady	763	" in case any member of the Gover'ment should be passing , and take away my licends . "
9266	9281	9283	9284	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" He 's told ' ee what 's happened to us , I suppose ? "
9286	9303	9342	9342	She	792	" Yes - in a way . D'ye think there 's any money hanging by it ? "
9304	9312	9314	9315	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" Ah , that 's the secret , "
9318	9341	9342	9342	She	792	" However , ' tis well to be kin to a coach , even if you do n't ride in ' en . "
9358	9393	9342	9342	She	792	" I 've been thinking since you brought the news that there 's a great rich lady out by Trantridge , on the edge o ' The Chase , of the name of d'Urberville . "
9394	9401	9403	9404	Sir John	177	" Hey - what 's that ? "
9411	9419	9420	9420	she	792	" That lady must be our relation , "
9423	9435	9420	9420	she	792	" And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin . "
9436	9450	9452	9452	Durbeyfield	198	" There IS a lady of the name , now you mention it , "
9454	9487	9452	9452	Durbeyfield	198	" Pa'son Tringham did n't think of that . But she 's nothing beside we - a junior branch of us , no doubt , hailing long since King Norman 's day . "
9524	9542	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" She is rich , and she 'd be sure to take notice o ' the maid , "
9547	9575	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" and ' twill be a very good thing . I do n't see why two branches o ' one family should not be on visiting terms . "
9576	9586	9588	9588	Abraham	212	" Yes ; and we 'll all claim kin ! "
9595	9625	9588	9588	Abraham	212	" And we 'll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her ; and we 'll ride in her coach and wear black clothes ! "
9626	9703	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" How do you come here , child ? What nonsense be ye talking ! Go away , and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready ! ... Well , Tess ought to go to this other member of our family . She 'd be sure to win the lady - Tess would ; and likely enough ' twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her . In short , I know it . "
9704	9707	9588	9588	Abraham	212	" How ? "
9708	9751	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" I tried her fate in the Fortune - Teller , and it brought out that very thing ! ... You should ha ' seen how pretty she looked to - day ; her skin is as sumple as a duchess ' . "
9752	9761	9588	9588	Abraham	212	" What says the maid herself to going ? "
9762	9805	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" I 've not asked her . She do n't know there is any such lady - relation yet . But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage , and she wo n't say nay to going . "
9806	9811	9588	9588	Abraham	212	" Tess is queer . "
9812	9825	9544	9545	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" But she 's tractable at bottom . Leave her to me . "
9877	9906	9910	9912	the elderly boozers	800	" Tess is a fine figure o ' fun , as I said to myself to - day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest , "
9917	9933	9910	9912	the elderly boozers	800	" But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she do n't get green malt in floor . "

10091	10129	10083	10084	Mrs Rolliver	211	" No noise , please , if ye'll be so good , my dears ; or I mid lose my licends , and be summons'd , and I do n't know what all ! ' Night t'ye ! "
10340	10352	10316	10316	his	816	" I 've got a fam - ily vault at Kingsbere ! "
10353	10364	10366	10367	his wife	819	" Hush - do n't be so silly , Jacky , "
10369	10440	10366	10367	his wife	819	" Yours is not the only family that was of ' count in wold days . Look at the Anktells , and Horseys , and the Tringhams themselves - gone to seed a'most as much as you - though you was bigger folks than they , that 's true . Thank God , I was never of no family , and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way ! "
10441	10480	10316	10316	his	816	" Do n't you be so sure o ' that . From you nater ' tis my belief you 've disgraced yourselves more than any o ' us , and was kings and queens outright at one time . "
10505	10527	10493	10493	her	198	" I am afraid father wo n't be able to take the journey with the beehives to - morrow so early . "
10528	10542	10544	10544	Durbeyfield	198	" I ? I shall be all right in an hour or two , "
10639	10647	10648	10648	she	180	" The poor man ca n't go , "
10688	10694	10695	10695	she	198	" But somebody must go , "
10698	10745	10695	10695	she	198	" It is late for the hives already . Swarming will soon be over for the year ; and it we put off taking 'em till next week 's market the call for 'em will be past , and they 'll be thrown on our hands . "
10754	10778	10779	10779	she	198	" Some young feller , perhaps , would go ? One of them who were so much after dancing with ' ee yesterday , "
10783	10796	10798	10798	Tess	198	" O no - I would n't have it for the world ! "
10801	10833	10798	10798	Tess	198	" And letting everybody know the reason - such a thing to be ashamed of ! I think I could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company . "
11211	11214	11215	11215	he	212	" Tess ! "
11226	11231	11369	11370	His sister	845	" Yes , Abraham . "
11232	11242	11369	11370	His sister	845	" Bain't you glad that we 've become gentlefolk ? "
11243	11248	11369	11370	His sister	845	" Not particular glad . "
11249	11264	11369	11370	His sister	845	" But you be glad that you ' m going to marry a gentleman ? "
11265	11268	11270	11270	Tess	198	" What ? "
11276	11290	11369	11370	His sister	845	" That our great relation will help ' ee to marry a gentleman . "
11291	11312	11369	11370	His sister	845	" I ? Our great relation ? We have no such relation . What has put that into your head ? "
11313	11368	11369	11370	His sister	845	" I heard 'em talking about it up at Rolliver 's when I went to find father . There 's a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge , and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady , she 'd put ' ee in the way of marrying a gentleman . "
11542	11548	11549	11549	she	198	" Never mind that now ! "
11552	11563	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" Did you say the stars were worlds , Tess ? "
11564	11567	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" Yes . "
11568	11573	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" All like ours ? "
11574	11610	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" I do n't know ; but I think so . They sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbard - tree . Most of them splendid and sound - a few blighted . "
11611	11626	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" Which do we live on - a splendid one or a blighted one ? "
11627	11632	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" A blighted one . "
11633	11657	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" ' Tis very unlucky that we did n't pitch on a sound one , when there were so many more of 'em ! "
11658	11661	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" Yes . "
11662	11671	11673	11673	Abraham	212	" Is it like that REALLY , Tess ? "
11688	11703	11673	11673	Abraham	212	" How would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one ? "
11704	11746	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" Well , father would n't have coughed and creeped about as he does , and would n't have got too tipsy to go on this journey ; and mother would n't have been always washing , and never getting finished . "
11747	11773	11673	11673	Abraham	212	" And you would have been a rich lady ready - made , and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman ? "
11774	11789	11495	11496	a gentleman	6008	" O Aby , do n't - do n't talk of that any more ! "
12104	12108	12060	12060	They	853	" Hoi there ! "
12365	12373	12374	12374	he	860	" You was on the wrong side , "
12377	12431	12374	12374	he	860	" I am bound to go on with the mail - bags , so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your load . I 'll send somebody to help you as soon as I can . It is getting daylight , and you have nothing to fear . "
12543	12553	12554	12555	the girl	647	" ' Tis all my doing - all mine ! "
12563	12584	12585	12585	She	647	" No excuse for me - none . What will mother and father live on now ? Aby , Aby ! "
12599	12613	12585	12585	She	647	" We ca n't go on with our load - Prince is killed ! "
12631	12641	12642	12642	she	647	" Why , I danced and laughed only yesterday ! "
12648	12658	12642	12642	she	647	" To think that I was such a fool ! "
12659	12682	12684	12684	Abraham	212	" ' Tis because we be on a blighted star , and not a sound one , is n't it , Tess ? "
13038	13041	13043	13043	he	223	" No , "
13046	13098	13043	13043	he	223	" I wo n't sell his old body . When we d'Urbervilles was knights in the land , we did n't sell our chargers for cat 's meat . Let 'em keep their shillings ! He've served me well in his lifetime , and I wo n't part from him now . "
13211	13218	13220	13220	Abraham	212	" Is he gone to heaven ? "
13393	13406	13408	13408	she	658	" We must take the ups wi ' the downs , Tess , "
13410	13479	13408	13408	she	658	" and never could your high blood have been found out at a more called - for moment . You must try your friends . Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs d'Urberville living on the outskirts o ' The Chase , who must be our relation ? You must go to her and claim kin , and ask for some help in our trouble . "
13480	13489	13491	13491	Tess	198	" I should n't care to do that , "
13493	13521	13491	13491	Tess	198	" If there is such a lady , ' twould be enough for us if she were friendly - not to expect her to give us help . "
13522	13560	13408	13408	she	658	" You could win her round to do anything , my dear . Besides , perhaps there 's more in it than you know of . I 've heard what I 've heard , good - now . "
13652	13661	13662	13662	she	198	" I 'd rather try to get work , "
13665	13673	13675	13676	his wife	819	" Durbeyfield , you can settle it , "
13687	13700	13675	13676	his wife	819	" If you say she ought to go , she will go . "
13701	13717	13719	13719	he	899	" I do n't like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin , "
13721	13744	13719	13719	he	899	" I 'm the head of the noblest branch o ' the family , and I ought to live up to it . "
13761	13772	13773	13773	she	198	" Well , as I killed the horse , mother , "
13777	13824	13773	13773	she	198	" I suppose I ought to do something . I do n't mind going and seeing her , but you must leave it to me about asking for help . And do n't go thinking about her making a match for me - it is silly . "
13825	13832	13834	13835	her father	557	" Very well said , Tess ! "
13838	13847	13849	13849	Joan	205	" Who said I had such a thought ? "
13851	13867	13773	13773	she	198	" I fancy it is in your mind , mother . But I 'll go . "
14988	15003	15004	15004	she	978	" I thought we were an old family ; but this is all new ! "
15027	15031	15004	15004	she	978	" claiming kin , "
15549	15562	15564	15564	he	1006	" Well , my Beauty , what can I do for you ? "
15577	15597	15564	15564	he	1006	" Never mind me . I am Mr d'Urberville . Have you come to see me or my mother ? "
15681	15691	15659	15659	she	198	" I came to see your mother , sir . "
15692	15707	15720	15721	Mr Alec	367	" I am afraid you can not see her - she is an invalid , "
15732	15751	15720	15721	Mr Alec	367	" Can not I answer your purpose ? What is the business you wish to see her about ? "
15752	15767	15790	15790	Tess	198	" It is n't business - it is - I can hardly say what ! "
15768	15771	15720	15721	Mr Alec	367	" Pleasure ? "
15772	15789	15790	15790	Tess	198	" Oh no . Why , sir , if I tell you , it will seem - "
15837	15844	15845	15845	she	198	" It is so very foolish , "
15848	15856	15845	15845	she	198	" I fear ca n't tell you ! "
15857	15872	15874	15874	he	1014	" Never mind ; I like foolish things . Try again , my dear , "
15877	15884	15885	15885	Tess	198	" Mother asked me to come , "
15888	15933	15885	15885	Tess	198	" and , indeed , I was in the mind to do so myself likewise . But I did not think it would be like this . I came , sir , to tell you that we are of the same family as you . "
15934	15940	15845	15845	she	198	" Ho ! Poor relations ? "
15941	15944	15885	15885	Tess	198	" Yes . "
15945	15948	15845	15845	she	198	" Stokes ? "
15949	15954	15885	15885	Tess	198	" No ; d'Urbervilles . "
15955	15964	15845	15845	she	198	" Ay , ay ; I mean d'Urbervilles . "
15965	16055	15885	15885	Tess	198	" Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield ; but we have several proofs that we are d'Urbervilles . Antiquarians hold we are , - and - and we have an old seal , marked with a ramping lion on a shield , and a castle over him . And we have a very old silver spoon , round in the bowl like a little ladle , and marked with the same castle . But it is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea - soup . "
16056	16065	16067	16067	he	1017	" A castle argent is certainly my crest , "
16070	16078	16067	16067	he	1017	" And my arms a lion rampant . "
16079	16114	15885	15885	Tess	198	" And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you - as we 've lost our horse by a bad accident , and are the oldest branch o ' the family . "
16115	16138	16139	16139	Alec	367	" Very kind of your mother , I 'm sure . And I , for one , do n't regret her step . "
16157	16178	16139	16139	Alec	367	" And so , my pretty girl , you 've come on a friendly visit to us , as relations ? "
16179	16185	16187	16187	Tess	198	" I suppose I have , "
16193	16212	16213	16213	She	198	" Well - there 's no harm in it . Where do you live ? What are you ? "
16242	16270	16234	16240	the same carrier who had brought her	1018	" It is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross . Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time , my pretty Coz ? "
16330	16333	16335	16335	Tess	198	" Yes , "
16337	16342	16335	16335	Tess	198	" when they come . "
16343	16349	16350	16350	D'Urberville	230	" They are already here . "
16380	16383	16386	16386	he	471	" British Queen "
16399	16404	16405	16405	she	198	" No - no ! "
16419	16430	16405	16405	she	198	" I would rather take it in my own hand . "
16431	16434	16435	16435	he	471	" Nonsense ! "
16570	16615	16567	16567	he	471	" Now , by the time you have had something to eat , it will be time for you to leave , if you want to catch the carrier to Shaston . Come here , and I 'll see what grub I can find . "
16673	16680	16681	16681	he	471	" Do you mind my smoking ? "
16684	16693	16694	16694	He	471	" Oh , not at all , sir . "
16740	16743	16719	16719	she	198	" tragic mischief "
16863	16872	16873	16873	she	198	" Now I am going home , sir , "
16878	16886	16887	16887	he	1031	" And what do they call you ? "
16907	16915	16891	16891	he	1031	" Tess Durbeyfield , down at Marlott . "
16916	16927	16944	16944	she	198	" And you say your people have lost their horse ? "
16928	16934	16935	16935	she	198	" I - killed him ! "
16952	16968	16944	16944	she	198	" And I do n't know what to do for father on account of it ! "
16969	17013	16944	16944	she	198	" I must think if I can not do something . My mother must find a berth for you . But , Tess , no nonsense about ' d'Urberville ' ; - ' Durbeyfield ' only , you know - quite another name . "
17014	17023	17025	17025	she	198	" I wish for no better , sir , "
17208	17211	17203	17203	Nature	231	" See ! "
17229	17232	17203	17203	Nature	231	" Here ! "
17239	17242	17203	17203	Nature	231	" Where ? "
17414	17438	17407	17407	he	223	" Well , I 'm damned ! What a funny thing ! Ha - ha - ha ! And what a crumby girl ! "
17519	17535	17503	17508	One among her fellow - travellers	1051	" Why , you be quite a posy ! And such roses in early June ! "
17773	17799	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" Oh yes ; I know all about it ! I told ' ee it would be all right , and now ' tis proved ! "
17800	17810	17812	17812	Tess	198	" Since I 've been away ? What has ? "
17833	17841	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" So you 've brought 'em round ! "
17842	17850	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" How do you know , mother ? "
17851	17858	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" I 've had a letter . "
17871	17929	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" They say - Mrs d'Urberville says - that she wants you to look after a little fowl - farm which is her hobby . But this is only her artful way of getting ' ee there without raising your hopes . She 's going to own ' ee as kin - that 's the meaning o't . "
17930	17938	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" But I did n't see her . "
17939	17947	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" You zid somebody , I suppose ? "
17948	17954	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" I saw her son . "
17955	17963	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" And did he own ' ee ? "
17964	17972	17816	17817	Her mother	658	" Well - he called me Coz . "
17973	17987	17989	17989	Joan	205	" An ' I knew it ! Jacky - he called her Coz ! "
17994	18014	17989	17989	Joan	205	" Well , he spoke to his mother , of course , and she do want ' ee there . "
18015	18029	18033	18033	Tess	198	" But I do n't know that I am apt at tending fowls , "
18035	18097	17989	17989	Joan	205	" Then I do n't know who is apt . You 've be'n born in the business , and brought up in it . They that be born in a business always know more about it than any ' prentice . Besides , that 's only just a show of something for you to do , that you midn't feel beholden . "
18098	18109	18111	18111	Tess	198	" I do n't altogether think I ought to go , "
18114	18128	18111	18111	Tess	198	" Who wrote the letter ? Will you let me look at it ? "
18129	18139	17989	17989	Joan	205	" Mrs d'Urberville wrote it . Here it is . "
18202	18209	18211	18211	Tess	198	" Oh - that 's all ! "
18213	18240	18211	18211	Tess	198	" You could n't expect her to throw her arms round ' ee , an ' to kiss and to coll ' ee all at once . "
18248	18259	18260	18260	she	198	" I would rather stay here with father and you , "
18263	18267	18241	18241	Tess	198	" But why ? "
18268	18288	18241	18241	Tess	198	" I 'd rather not tell you why , mother ; indeed , I do n't quite know why . "
18345	18352	18334	18337	one of the children	1074	" The gentleman 's been here ! "
18432	18475	18420	18427	the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds	1084	" Mr d'Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear ; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold . He is very much interested in ' ee - truth to tell . "
18508	18519	18520	18520	she	198	" It is very good of him to think that , "
18523	18544	18520	18520	she	198	" and if I was quite sure how it would be living there , I would go any - when . "
18545	18553	18476	18476	Tess	198	" He is a mighty handsome man ! "
18554	18561	18563	18563	Tess	198	" I do n't think so , "
18566	18589	18476	18476	Tess	198	" Well , there 's your chance , whether or no ; and I 'm sure he wears a beautiful diamond ring ! "
18590	18593	18595	18596	little Abraham	212	" Yes , "
18606	18643	18595	18596	little Abraham	212	" and I seed it ! and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers . Mother , why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers ? "
18644	18650	18652	18653	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" Hark at that child ! "
18659	18667	18669	18670	Sir John	177	" Perhaps to show his diamond ring , "
18678	18685	18687	18687	Tess	198	" I 'll think it over , "
18693	18712	18714	18715	the matron	668	" Well , she 's made a conquest o ' the younger branch of us , straight off , "
18720	18734	18714	18715	the matron	668	" and she 's a fool if she do n't follow it up . "
18735	18748	18750	18751	the haggler	5825	" I do n't quite like my children going away from home , "
18753	18769	18750	18751	the haggler	5825	" As the head of the family , the rest ought to come to me . "
18770	18779	18781	18784	his poor witless wife	1090	" But do let her go , Jacky , "
18786	18829	18781	18784	his poor witless wife	1090	" He 's struck wi ' her - you can see that . He called her Coz ! He 'll marry her , most likely , and make a lady of her ; and then she 'll be what her forefathers was . "
18848	18860	18861	18861	he	791	" Well , perhaps that 's what young Mr d'Urberville means , "
18864	18906	18861	18861	he	791	" and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood by linking on to the old line . Tess , the little rogue ! And have she really paid 'em a visit to such an end as this ? "
18937	18947	18948	18948	she	658	" Well , what be you going to do ? "
18951	18960	18962	18962	Tess	198	" I wish I had seen Mrs d'Urberville , "
18964	18982	18931	18932	her mother	658	" I think you mid as well settle it . Then you 'll see her soon enough . "
18990	18999	19001	19002	the girl	647	" I do n't know what to say ! "
19005	19048	19001	19002	the girl	647	" It is for you to decide . I killed the old horse , and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one . But - but - I do n't quite like Mr d'Urberville being there ! "
19104	19136	19137	19137	they	700	" Tess wo n't go - o - o and be made a la - a - dy of ! - no , she says she wo - o - on't ! "
19144	19182	19137	19137	they	700	" And we sha n't have a nice new horse , and lots o ' golden money to buy fairlings ! And Tess wo n't look pretty in her best cloze no mo - o - ore ! "
19229	19234	19236	19236	Tess	198	" I will go , "
19259	19279	19240	19241	Her mother	658	" That 's right ! For such a pretty maid as ' tis , this is a fine chance ! "
19284	19315	19280	19280	Tess	198	" I hope it is a chance for earning money . It is no other kind of chance . You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish . "
19433	19437	19439	19440	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" A cart ? "
19443	19455	19439	19440	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" It might have been a carriage for her own kin ! "
19662	19681	19658	19659	Her mother	658	" You will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dand than that ? "
19682	19690	19692	19692	Tess	198	" But I am going to work ! "
19694	19699	19701	19702	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" Well , yes , "
19710	19738	19739	19739	she	658	" at first there mid be a little pretence o't ... But I think it will be wiser of ' ee to put your best side outward , "
19742	19752	19754	19754	Tess	198	" Very well ; I suppose you know best , "
19777	19787	19764	19765	the girl	647	" Do what you like with me , mother . "
19900	19913	19915	19915	Tess	198	" I declare there 's a hole in my stocking - heel ! "
19917	19954	19915	19915	Tess	198	" Never mind holes in your stockings - they do n't speak ! When I was a maid , so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha ' found me in heels . "
19985	19991	19992	19992	she	198	" You must zee yourself ! "
19995	20006	19992	19992	she	198	" It is much better than you was t'other day . "
20079	20091	20093	20093	she	198	" I 'll tell ' ee what ' tis , Durbeyfield , "
20096	20182	20093	20093	she	198	" he 'll never have the heart not to love her . But whatever you do , do n't zay too much to Tess of his fancy for her , and this chance she has got . She is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him , or against going there , even now . If all goes well , I shall certainly be for making some return to pa'son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us - dear , good man ! "
20315	20345	20306	20308	the younger children	704	" I do want to walk a little - ways wi ' Sissy , now she 's going to marry our gentleman - cousin , and wear fine cloze ! "
20346	20349	20351	20351	Tess	198	" Now , "
20358	20381	20351	20351	Tess	198	" I 'll hear no more o ' that ! Mother , how could you ever put such stuff into their heads ? "
20382	20405	20407	20408	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" Going to work , my dears , for our rich relation , and help get enough money for a new horse , "
20411	20416	20418	20418	Tess	198	" Goodbye , father , "
20425	20431	20433	20434	Sir John	177	" Goodbye , my maid , "
20461	20514	20433	20434	Sir John	177	" Well , I hope my young friend will like such a comely sample of his own blood . And tell'n , Tess , that being sunk , quite , from our former grandeur , I 'll sell him the title - yes , sell it - and at no onreasonable figure . "
20515	20524	20526	20527	Lady Durbeyfield	235	" Not for less than a thousand pound ! "
20529	20623	20624	20624	Tess	198	" Tell'n - I 'll take a thousand pound . Well , I 'll take less , when I come to think o't . He 'll adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like myself can . Tell'n he shall hae it for a hundred . But I wo n't stand upon trifles - tell'n he shall hae it for fifty - for twenty pound ! Yes , twenty pound - that 's the lowest . Dammy , family honour is family honour , and I wo n't take a penny less ! "
20822	20838	20840	20841	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" Bide here a bit , and the cart will soon come , no doubt , "
20843	20851	20840	20841	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" Yes , I see it yonder ! "
21119	21133	21135	21137	the youngest child	1170	" Is dat the gentleman - kinsman who 'll make Sissy a lady ? "
21312	21328	21307	21309	The youngest child	1170	" I wish poor , poor Tess was n't gone away to be a lady ! "
21427	21436	21437	21437	she	205	" Oh , I do n't know exactly , "
21440	21458	21437	21437	she	205	" I was thinking that perhaps it would ha ' been better if Tess had not gone . "
21459	21470	21418	21419	her husband	791	" Ought n't ye to have thought of that before ? "
21471	21521	21437	21437	she	205	" Well , ' tis a chance for the maid - Still , if ' twere the doing again , I would n't let her go till I had found out whether the gentleman is really a good - hearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman . "
21522	21536	21538	21539	Sir John	177	" Yes , you ought , perhaps , to ha ' done that , "
21550	21606	21541	21542	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" Well , as one of the genuine stock , she ought to make her way with ' en , if she plays her trump card aright . And if he do n't marry her afore he will after . For that he 's all afire wi ' love for her any eye can see . "
21607	21621	21541	21542	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" What 's her trump card ? Her d'Urberville blood , you mean ? "
21622	21635	21541	21542	Joan Durbeyfield	205	" No , stupid ; her face - as ' twas mine . "
21784	21796	21797	21797	she	205	" You will go down slow , sir , I suppose ? "
21833	21838	21839	21839	he	230	" Why , Tess , "
21848	21882	21839	21839	he	230	" it is n't a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that ? Why , I always go down at full gallop . There 's nothing like it for raising your spirits . "
21883	21891	21803	21803	D'Urberville	230	" But perhaps you need not now ? "
21892	21895	21896	21896	he	230	" Ah , "
21903	21932	21900	21900	his	230	" there are two to be reckoned with . It is not me alone . Tib has to be considered , and she has a very queer temper . "
21933	21936	21803	21803	D'Urberville	230	" Who ? "
21937	21964	21900	21900	his	230	" Why , this mare . I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just then . Did n't you notice it ? "
21965	21975	21977	21977	Tess	198	" Do n't try to frighten me , sir , "
21980	22020	21900	21900	his	230	" Well , I do n't . If any living man can manage this horse I can : I wo n't say any living man can do it - but if such has the power , I am he . "
22021	22030	21900	21900	his	230	" Why do you have such a horse ? "
22031	22099	21900	21900	his	230	" Ah , well may you ask it ! It was my fate , I suppose . Tib has killed one chap ; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me . And then , take my word for it , I nearly killed her . But she 's touchy still , very touchy ; and one 's life is hardly safe behind her sometimes . "
22302	22324	22294	22294	she	198	" Do n't touch my arm ! We shall be thrown out if you do ! Hold on round my waist ! "
22337	22349	22351	22351	she	198	" Safe , thank God , in spite of your fooling ! "
22358	22367	22325	22325	She	198	" Tess - fie ! that 's temper ! "
22371	22376	22401	22401	She	198	" ' Tis truth . "
22377	22400	22401	22401	She	198	" Well , you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself our of danger . "
22448	22454	22416	22416	woman	744	" Now then , again ! "
22458	22463	22465	22465	Tess	198	" No , no ! "
22467	22476	22465	22465	Tess	198	" Show more sense , do , please . "
22477	22499	22500	22500	he	1197	" But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the county , they must get down again , "
22532	22552	22517	22517	his	1197	" Now then , put your arms round my waist again , as you did before , my Beauty . "
22553	22556	22558	22558	Tess	198	" Never ! "
22572	22605	22622	22622	he	1197	" Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips , Tess , or even on that warmed cheek , and I 'll stop - on my honour , I will ! "
22634	22640	22641	22641	she	198	" Will nothing else do ? "
22678	22684	22685	22685	he	1197	" Nothing , dear Tess , "
22688	22704	22705	22705	she	198	" Oh , I do n't know - very well ; I do n't mind ! "
22762	22775	22777	22777	her	198	" Now , damn it - I 'll break both our necks ! "
22782	22800	22777	22777	her	198	" So you can go from your word like that , you young witch , can you ? "
22801	22805	22807	22807	Tess	198	" Very well , "
22809	22839	22807	22807	Tess	198	" I 'll not move since you be so determined ! But I - thought you would be kind to me , and protect me , as my kinsman ! "
22840	22847	22777	22777	her	198	" Kinsman be hanged ! Now ! "
22848	22861	22862	22862	she	198	" But I do n't want anybody to kiss me , sir ! "
22889	22902	22862	22862	she	198	" And I would n't ha ' come if I had known ! "
22972	22982	22984	22986	the young man	471	" You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl ! "
23083	23092	23093	23093	he	1207	" You shall be made sorry for that ! "
23109	23129	23103	23103	he	1207	" Unless , that is , you agree willingly to let me do it again , and no handkerchief . "
23133	23139	23140	23140	she	198	" Very well , sir ! "
23143	23152	23140	23140	she	198	" Oh - let me get my hat ! "
23210	23227	23228	23228	he	1207	" You look prettier with it off , upon my soul , if that 's possible , "
23240	23252	23228	23228	he	1207	" Now then , up again ! What 's the matter ? "
23268	23273	23274	23274	she	198	" No , sir , "
23293	23302	23274	23274	she	198	" not again , if I know it ! "
23303	23314	23274	23274	she	198	" What - you wo n't get up beside me ? "
23315	23322	23274	23274	she	198	" No ; I shall walk . "
23323	23334	23274	23274	she	198	" ' Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge . "
23335	23352	23274	23274	she	198	" I do n't care if ' tis dozens . Besides , the cart is behind . "
23353	23380	23274	23274	she	198	" You artful hussy ! Now , tell me - did n't you make that hat blow off on purpose ? I 'll swear you did ! "
23443	23457	23459	23459	Tess	198	" You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words ! "
23475	23501	23459	23459	Tess	198	" I do n't like ' ee at all ! I hate and detest you ! I 'll go back to mother , I will ! "
23518	23528	23529	23529	he	1212	" Well , I like you all the better , "
23532	23557	23529	23529	he	1212	" Come , let there be peace . I 'll never do it any more against your will . My life upon it now ! "
23953	23965	23966	23966	they	1235	" ' Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather 's time , "
24130	24139	24140	24140	she	198	" Mrs d'Urberville wants the fowls as usual , "
24155	24165	24152	24152	she	198	" Mis'ess is a old lady , and blind . "
24166	24169	24171	24171	Tess	198	" Blind ! "
24378	24393	24395	24396	Mrs d'Urberville	6191	" Ah , you are the young woman come to look after my birds ? "
24403	24489	24395	24396	Mrs d'Urberville	6191	" I hope you will be kind to them . My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person . Well , where are they ? Ah , this is Strut ! But he is hardly so lively to - day , is he ? He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger , I suppose . And Phena too - yes , they are a little frightened - are n't you , dears ? But they will soon get used to you . "
24741	24746	24736	24736	her	1273	" Can you whistle ? "
24747	24752	24727	24728	Mrs d'Urberville	1283	" Whistle , Ma'am ? "
24753	24759	24736	24736	her	1273	" Yes , whistle tunes . "
24797	24886	24727	24728	Mrs d'Urberville	1283	" Then you will have to practise it every day . I had a lad who did it very well , but he has left . I want you to whistle to my bullfinches ; as I can not see them , I like to hear them , and we teach 'em airs that way . Tell her where the cages are , Elizabeth . You must begin to - morrow , or they will go back in their piping . They have been neglected these several days . "
24887	24898	24900	24900	Elizabeth	213	" Mr d'Urberville whistled to 'em this morning , ma'am , "
24902	24907	24900	24900	Elizabeth	213	" He ! Pooh ! "
25262	25267	25269	25269	he	1304	" Upon my honour ! "
25271	25363	25269	25269	he	1304	" there was never before such a beautiful thing in Nature or Art as you look , ' Cousin ' Tess ' Cousin ' had a faint ring of mockery . I have been watching you from over the wall - sitting like IM - patience on a monument , and pouting up that pretty red mouth to whistling shape , and whooing and whooing , and privately swearing , and never being able to produce a note . Why , you are quite cross because you ca n't do it . "
25364	25376	25242	25242	he	1304	" I may be cross , but I did n't swear . "
25377	25434	25269	25269	he	1304	" Ah ! I understand why you are trying - those bullies ! My mother wants you to carry on their musical education . How selfish of her ! As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for any girl . I would flatly refuse , if I were you . "
25435	25455	25242	25242	he	1304	" But she wants me particularly to do it , and to be ready by to - morrow morning . "
25456	25472	25269	25269	he	1304	" Does she ? Well then - I 'll give you a lesson or two . "
25473	25481	25483	25483	Tess	198	" Oh no , you wo n't ! "
25490	25549	25550	25550	He	1307	" Nonsense ; I do n't want to touch you . See - I 'll stand on this side of the wire - netting , and you can keep on the other ; so you may feel quite safe . Now , look here ; you screw up your lips too harshly . There ' tis - so . "
25563	25572	25550	25550	He	1307	" Take , O take those lips away . "
25581	25585	25587	25587	d'Urberville	230	" Now try , "
25653	25657	25649	25649	He	1307	" Try again ! "
25705	25766	25698	25698	she	198	" That 's it ! Now I have started you - you 'll go on beautifully . There - I said I would not come near you ; and , in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man , I 'll keep my word ... Tess , do you think my mother a queer old soul ? "
25767	25779	25649	25649	He	1307	" I do n't know much of her yet , sir . "
25780	25852	25698	25698	she	198	" You 'll find her so ; she must be , to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches . I am rather out of her books just now , but you will be quite in favour if you treat her live - stock well . Good morning . If you meet with any difficulties and want help here , do n't go to the bailiff , come to me . "
26851	26862	26863	26863	he	1363	" What - my Beauty ? You here so late ? "
26878	26885	26887	26887	he	1363	" I 'll see you again , "
27115	27259	27105	27105	their	1366	" - that is to say , the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products , the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene . Through this floating , fusty debris of peat and hay , mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers , and forming together a sort of vegeto - human pollen , the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes , in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out . They coughed as they danced , and laughed as they coughed . Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lights - the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs - a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes ; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus , and always failing .
27333	27351	27352	27352	he	1380	" The maids do n't think it respectable to dance at The Flower - de - Luce , "
27355	27397	27352	27352	he	1380	" They do n't like to let everybody see which be their fancy - men . Besides , the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints begin to get greased . So we come here and send out for liquor . "
27398	27408	27410	27410	Tess	198	" But when be any of you going home ? "
27415	27429	27430	27430	She	198	" Now - a'most directly . This is all but the last jig . "
27542	27554	27558	27558	his	1386	" Do n't ye be nervous , my dear good soul , "
27590	27624	27587	27588	a saint	1388	" What 's yer hurry ? To - morrow is Sunday , thank God , and we can sleep it off in church - time . Now , have a turn with me ? "
27846	27862	27887	27887	she	1403	" You shall catch it for this , my gentleman , when you get home ! "
28003	28015	27991	27991	He	1402	" Well , my Beauty , what are you doing here ? "
28061	28081	28036	28036	she	198	" But it seems they will never leave off , and I really think I will wait no longer . "
28082	28123	28158	28158	she	198	" Certainly do not . I have only a saddle - horse here to - day ; but come to The Flower - de - Luce , and I 'll hire a trap , and drive you home with me . "
28174	28193	28158	28158	she	198	" I have said that I will wait for 'em , and they will expect me to now . "
28194	28224	28225	28225	He	1402	" Very well , Miss Independence . Please yourself ... Then I shall not hurry ... My good Lord , what a kick - up they are having there ! "
28705	28721	28723	28726	one of the group	1438	" Well - whatever is that a - creeping down thy back , Car Darch ? "
28770	28778	28723	28726	one of the group	1438	" ' Tis her hair falling down , "
28818	28823	28825	28827	an observant matron	1442	" ' Tis treacle , "
29106	29117	29118	29118	she	1444	" How darest th ' laugh at me , hussy ! "
29121	29132	29134	29134	Tess	198	" I could n't really help it when t'others did , "
29139	29192	29197	29199	the dark queen	1445	" Ah , th'st think th ' beest everybody , dostn't , because th ' beest first favourite with He just now ! But stop a bit , my lady , stop a bit ! I 'm as good as two of such ! Look here - here 's at ' ee ! "
29281	29291	29293	29294	the latter	462	" Indeed , then , I shall not fight ! "
29297	29328	29293	29294	the latter	462	" and if I had know you was of that sort , I would n't have so let myself down as to come with such a whorage as this is ! "
29542	29556	29557	29557	he	1463	" What the devil is all this row about , work - folk ? "
29618	29624	29625	29625	he	1463	" Jump up behind me , "
29628	29642	29625	29625	he	1463	" and we 'll get shot of the screaming cats in a jiffy ! "
29833	29840	29842	29849	a man who had not observed the incident	1472	" What be ye looking at ? "
29851	29858	29860	29861	dark Car	254	" Ho - ho - ho ! "
29863	29870	29877	29877	she	1473	" Hee - hee - hee ! "
29888	29895	29897	29898	dark Car	254	" Heu - heu - heu ! "
29910	29921	29906	29906	she	1475	" Out of the frying - pan into the fire ! "
30156	30167	30168	30168	he	1474	" Neatly done , was it not , dear Tess ? "
30174	30177	30179	30179	she	198	" Yes ! "
30181	30194	30168	30168	he	1474	" I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you . "
30195	30200	30140	30140	She	198	" And are you ? "
30206	30218	30168	30168	he	1474	" Tess , why do you always dislike my kissing you ? "
30219	30230	30168	30168	he	1474	" I suppose - because I do n't love you . "
30231	30237	30168	30168	he	1474	" You are quite sure ? "
30238	30246	30168	30168	he	1474	" I am angry with you sometimes ! "
30247	30256	30168	30168	he	1474	" Ah , I half feared as much . "
30276	30290	30267	30267	He	1474	" Why have n't you told me when I have made you angry ? "
30291	30306	30168	30168	he	1474	" You know very well why . Because I can not help myself here . "
30307	30319	30267	30267	He	1474	" I have n't offended you often by love - making ? "
30320	30325	30168	30168	he	1474	" You have sometimes . "
30326	30331	30267	30267	He	1474	" How many times ? "
30332	30344	30168	30168	he	1474	" You know as well as I - too many times . "
30345	30352	30267	30267	He	1474	" Every time I have tried ? "
30671	30677	30678	30678	he	1490	" That is devilish unkind ! "
30681	30694	30678	30678	he	1490	" I mean no harm - only to keep you from falling . "
30718	30726	30710	30710	she	1482	" I beg your pardon , sir . "
30727	30744	30745	30745	he	1490	" I wo n't pardon you unless you show some confidence in me . Good God ! "
30749	30791	30710	30710	she	1482	" what am I , to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you ? For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings , eluded me , and snubbed me ; and I wo n't stand it ! "
30792	30803	30710	30710	she	1482	" I 'll leave you to - morrow , sir . "
30804	30886	30710	30710	she	1482	" No , you will not leave me to - morrow ! Will you , I ask once more , show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm ? Come , between us two and nobody else , now . We know each other well ; and you know that I love you , and think you the prettiest girl in the world , which you are . May n't I treat you as a lover ? "
30909	30927	30887	30887	She	1493	" I do n't know - I wish - how can I say yes or no when - "
31002	31009	31010	31010	she	1493	" Why , where be we ? "
31013	31019	31010	31010	she	1493	" Passing by a wood . "
31020	31036	31010	31010	she	1493	" A wood - what wood ? Surely we are quite out of the road ? "
31037	31067	31010	31010	she	1493	" A bit of The Chase - the oldest wood in England . It is a lovely night , and why should we not prolong our ride a little ? "
31068	31076	31078	31078	Tess	198	" How could you be so treacherous ! "
31110	31151	31108	31108	herself	198	" Just when I 've been putting such trust in you , and obliging you to please you , because I thought I had wronged you by that push ! Please set me down , and let me walk home . "
31152	31195	31010	31010	she	1493	" You can not walk home , darling , even if the air were clear . We are miles away from Trantridge , if I must tell you , and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees . "
31196	31201	31202	31202	she	198	" Never mind that , "
31205	31232	31202	31202	she	198	" Put me down , I beg you . I do n't mind where it is ; only let me get down , sir , please ! "
31233	31391	31010	31010	she	1493	" Very well , then , I will - on one condition . Having brought you here to this out - of - the - way place , I feel myself responsible for your safe - conduct home , whatever you may yourself feel about it . As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance , it is quite impossible ; for , to tell the truth , dear , owing to this fog , which so disguises everything , I do n't quite know where we are myself . Now , if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house , and ascertain exactly our whereabouts , I 'll deposit you here willingly . When I come back I 'll give you full directions , and if you insist upon walking you may ; or you may ride - at your pleasure . "
31423	31432	31434	31434	she	1498	" I suppose I must hold the horse ? "
31436	31445	31447	31447	Alec	367	" Oh no ; it 's not necessary , "
31454	31466	31447	31447	Alec	367	" He 's had enough of it for to - night . "
31502	31509	31510	31510	he	1499	" Now , you sit there , "
31513	31537	31510	31510	he	1499	" The leaves have not got damp as yet . Just give an eye to the horse - it will be quite sufficient . "
31553	31576	31538	31538	He	1499	" By the bye , Tess , your father has a new cob to - day . Somebody gave it to him . "
31577	31582	31538	31538	He	1499	" Somebody ? You ! "
31586	31596	31597	31597	she	1498	" O how very good of you that is ! "
31615	31623	31538	31538	He	1499	" And the children have some toys . "
31624	31636	31637	31637	she	1498	" I did n't know - you ever sent them anything ! "
31643	31658	31637	31637	she	1498	" I almost wish you had not - yes , I almost wish it ! "
31659	31664	31538	31538	He	1499	" Why , dear ? "
31665	31672	31637	31637	she	1498	" It - hampers me so . "
31673	31686	31538	31538	He	1499	" Tessy - do n't you love me ever so little now ? "
31687	31692	31693	31693	she	1498	" I 'm grateful , "
31697	31705	31693	31693	she	1498	" But I fear I do not - "
31741	31762	31763	31763	She	1498	" Do n't cry , dear , dear one ! Now sit down here , and wait till I come . "
31778	31783	31784	31784	he	1499	" Are you cold ? "
31787	31794	31799	31799	his	1499	" Not very - a little . "
31810	31824	31795	31795	He	1499	" You have only that puffy muslin dress on - how 's that ? "
31825	31859	31799	31799	his	1499	" It 's my best summer one . ' Twas very warm when I started , and I did n't know I was going to ride , and that it would be night . "
31860	31871	31872	31872	He	1499	" Nights grow chilly in September . Let me see . "
31890	31901	31902	31902	he	1499	" That 's it - now you 'll feel warmer , "
31905	31921	31902	31902	he	1499	" Now , my pretty , rest there ; I shall soon be back again . "
32237	32240	32242	32242	d'Urberville	230	" Tess ! "
32620	32626	32616	32616	their	1525	" It was to be . "
33157	33168	33170	33170	d'Urberville	1551	" Why did you slip away by stealth like this ? "
33176	33278	33170	33170	d'Urberville	1551	" on a Sunday morning , too , when people were all in bed ! I only discovered it by accident , and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake you . Just look at the mare . Why go off like this ? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going . And how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot , and encumber yourself with this heavy load ! I have followed like a madman , simply to drive you the rest of the distance , if you wo n't come back . "
33279	33286	33288	33288	she	198	" I sha n't come back , "
33290	33317	33318	33318	She	198	" I thought you would n't - I said so ! Well , then , put up your basket , and let me help you on . "
33475	33482	33483	33483	he	1554	" What are you crying for ? "
33487	33499	33501	33501	Tess	198	" I was only thinking that I was born over there , "
33503	33513	33638	33638	She	198	" Well - we must all be born somewhere . "
33514	33528	33549	33549	She	198	" I wish I had never been born - there or anywhere else ! "
33529	33548	33638	33638	She	198	" Pooh ! Well , if you did n't wish to come to Trantridge why did you come ? "
33554	33569	33549	33549	She	198	" You did n't come for love of me , that I 'll swear . "
33570	33632	33638	33638	She	198	" ' Tis quite true . If I had gone for love o ' you , if I had ever sincerely loved you , if I loved you still , I should not so loathe and hate myself for my weakness as I do now ! ... My eyes were dazed by you for a little , and that was all . "
33641	33654	33638	33638	She	198	" I did n't understand your meaning till it was too late . "
33655	33663	33638	33638	She	198	" That 's what every woman says . "
33664	33674	33675	33675	she	198	" How can you dare to use such words ! "
33703	33732	33683	33683	her	198	" My God ! I could knock you out of the gig ! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel ? "
33733	33737	33738	33738	he	1558	" Very well , "
33743	33759	33760	33760	He	1558	" I am sorry to wound you . I did wrong - I admit it . "
33770	33843	33760	33760	He	1558	" Only you need n't be so everlastingly flinging it in my face . I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing . You know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again . You know you may clothe yourself with the best , instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected , as if you could n't get a ribbon more than you earn . "
33866	33904	33844	33844	Her	1559	" I have said I will not take anything more from you , and I will not - I can not ! I SHOULD be your creature to go on doing that , and I wo n't ! "
33905	34062	34066	34066	she	1560	" One would think you were a princess from your manner , in addition to a true and original d'Urberville - ha ! ha ! Well , Tess , dear , I can say no more . I suppose I am a bad fellow - a damn bad fellow . I was born bad , and I have lived bad , and I shall die bad in all probability . But , upon my lost soul , I wo n't be bad towards you again , Tess . And if certain circumstances should arise - you understand - in which you are in the least need , the least difficulty , send me one line , and you shall have by return whatever you require . I may not be at Trantridge - I am going to London for a time - I ca n't stand the old woman . But all letters will be forwarded . "
34145	34160	34135	34135	his	1561	" You are not going to turn away like that , dear ! Come ! "
34161	34166	34167	34167	she	1560	" If you wish , "
34171	34179	34167	34167	she	1560	" See how you 've mastered me ! "
34248	34260	34239	34239	she	1560	" Now the other side , for old acquaintance ' sake . "
34312	34340	34285	34285	he	1561	" You do n't give me your mouth and kiss me back . You never willingly do that - you 'll never love me , I fear . "
34341	34369	34370	34370	She	1560	" I have said so , often . It is true . I have never really and truly loved you , and I think I never can . "
34374	34438	34370	34370	She	1560	" Perhaps , of all things , a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now ; but I have honour enough left , little as ' tis , not to tell that lie . If I did love you , I may have the best o ' causes for letting you know it . But I do n't . "
34467	34577	34439	34439	He	1566	" Well , you are absurdly melancholy , Tess . I have no reason for flattering you now , and I can say plainly that you need not be so sad . You can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts , gentle or simple ; I say it to you as a practical man and well - wisher . If you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before it fades ... And yet , Tess , will you come back to me ! Upon my soul , I do n't like to let you go like this ! "
34578	34608	34370	34370	She	1560	" Never , never ! I made up my mind as soon as I saw - what I ought to have seen sooner ; and I wo n't come . "
34609	34624	34439	34439	He	1566	" Then good morning , my four months ' cousin - good - bye ! "
34754	34757	34745	34745	he	1337	" Good morning "
34816	34827	34828	34828	he	1337	" It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn ! "
34832	34835	34837	34837	Tess	198	" Yes , "
34839	34852	34837	34837	Tess	198	" When most people are at rest from their week 's work . "
34859	34875	34853	34853	She	198	" Though I do more real work to - day than all the week besides . "
34876	34880	34929	34929	he	1516	" Do you ? "
34881	34923	34924	34925	The man	1516	" All the week I work for the glory of man , and on Sunday for the glory of God . That 's more real than the other - hey ? I have a little to do here at this stile . "
34943	34951	34952	34952	he	1516	" If you 'll wait a moment , "
34955	34962	34952	34952	he	1516	" I shall not be long . "
35111	35117	35106	35107	Some people	733	" Alas , poor Theology ! "
35186	35194	35195	35195	she	198	" Do you believe what you paint ? "
35201	35214	35237	35237	his	1516	" Believe that tex ? Do I believe in my own existence ! "
35215	35218	35220	35220	she	198	" But , "
35234	35234	35220	35220	she	198	"
35240	35251	35252	35252	he	1516	" I can not split hairs on that burning query , "
35255	35299	35252	35252	he	1516	" I have walked hundreds of miles this past summer , painting these texes on every wall , gate , and stile the length and breadth of this district . I leave their application to the hearts of the people who read 'em . "
35300	35307	35309	35309	Tess	198	" I think they are horrible , "
35311	35316	35309	35309	Tess	198	" Crushing ! Killing ! "
35317	35327	35328	35328	he	1516	" That 's what they are meant to be ! "
35335	35417	35328	35328	he	1516	" But you should read my hottest ones - them I kips for slums and seaports . They 'd make ye wriggle ! Not but what this is a very good tex for rural districts . ... Ah - there 's a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn standing to waste . I must put one there - one that it will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed . Will ye wait , missy ? "
35418	35421	35423	35423	she	198	" No , "
35524	35604	35518	35518	his	1586	" If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment , there 's a very earnest good man going to preach a charity - sermon to - day in the parish you are going to - Mr Clare of Emminster . I 'm not of his persuasion now , but he 's a good man , and he 'll expound as well as any parson I know . ' Twas he began the work in me . "
35624	35636	35637	35637	she	198	" Pooh - I do n't believe God said such things ! "
35747	35755	35757	35759	her surprised mother	1592	" Well ! - my dear Tess ! "
35768	35793	35757	35759	her surprised mother	1592	" How be ye ? I did n't see you till you was in upon me ! Have you come home to be married ? "
35794	35806	35862	35863	Her mother	658	" No , I have not come for that , mother . "
35807	35813	35757	35759	her surprised mother	1592	" Then for a holiday ? "
35814	35826	35828	35828	Tess	198	" Yes - for a holiday ; for a long holiday , "
35830	35844	35757	35759	her surprised mother	1592	" What , is n't your cousin going to do the handsome thing ? "
35845	35861	35862	35863	Her mother	658	" He 's not my cousin , and he 's not going to marry me . "
35868	35878	35879	35879	she	658	" Come , you have not told me all , "
35901	35913	35915	35916	her mother	658	" And yet th'st not got him to marry ' ee ! "
35918	35931	35915	35916	her mother	658	" Any woman would have done it but you , after that ! "

To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago ! See what he has given us - all , as we thought , because we were his kin . But if he 's not , it must have been done because of his love for ' ee . And yet you 've not got him to marry ! "

Why did n't you warn me ? Ladies know what to fend hands against , because they read novels that tell them of these tricks ; but I never had the chance o ' learning in that way , and you did not help me ! "

48698	48701	48687	48687	she	198	" Why ? "
48736	48747	48749	48750	the dairyman	1900	" Oh yes ; there 's nothing like a fiddle , "
48752	49382	48749	48750	the dairyman	1900	" Though I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows - at least that 's my experience . Once there was an old aged man over at Mellstock - William Dewy by name - one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over there - Jonathan , do ye mind ? - I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother , in a manner of speaking . Well , this man was a coming home along from a wedding , where he had been playing his fiddle , one fine moonlight night , and for shortness ' sake he took a cut across Forty - acres , a field lying that way , where a bull was out to grass . The bull seed William , and took after him , horns aground , begad ; and though William runned his best , and had n't MUCH drink in him considering ' twas a wedding , and the folks well off , he found he 'd never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself . Well , as a last thought , he pulled out his fiddle as he runned , and struck up a jig , turning to the bull , and backing towards the corner . The bull softened down , and stood still , looking hard at William Dewy , who fiddled on and on ; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull 's face . But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William 's breeches . Well , William had to turn about and play on , willy - nilly ; and ' twas only three o'clock in the world , and ' a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours , and he so leery and tired that ' a did n't know what to do . When he had scraped till about four o'clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon , and he said to himself , ' There 's only this last tune between me and eternal welfare ! Heaven save me , or I 'm a done man . ' Well , then he called to mind how he 'd seen the cattle kneel o ' Christmas Eves in the dead o ' night . It was not Christmas Eve then , but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull . So he broke into the ' Tivity Hymm , just as at Christmas carol - singing ; when , lo and behold , down went the bull on his bended knees , in his ignorance , just as if ' twere the true ' Tivity night and hour . As soon as his horned friend were down , William turned , clinked off like a long - dog , and jumped safe over hedge , before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him . William used to say that he 'd seen a man look a fool a good many times , but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon , and ' twas not Christmas Eve . ... Yes , William Dewy , that was the man 's name ; and I can tell you to a foot where 's he a - lying in Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment - just between the second yew - tree and the north aisle . "
49383	49405	48687	48687	she	198	" It 's a curious story ; it carries us back to medieval times , when faith was a living thing ! "
49454	49474	49440	49441	the narrator	2079	" Well , ' tis quite true , sir , whether or no . I knowed the man well . "
49475	49486	49488	49493	the person behind the dun cow	2080	" Oh yes ; I have no doubt of it , "
49544	49584	49598	49599	the dairyman	1900	" even by the dairyman himself . But no explanation was discernible ; he remained under the cow long enough to have milked three , uttering a private ejaculation now and then , as if he could not get on .
49585	49596	49598	49599	the dairyman	1900	" Take it gentle , sir ; take it gentle , "
49601	49613	49598	49599	the dairyman	1900	" ' Tis knack , not strength , that does it . "

He is a pa'son 's son , and is too much taken up wi ' his own thoughts to notice girls . He is the dairyman 's pupil - learning farming in all its branches . He has learnt sheep - farming at another place , and he 's now mastering dairy - work .... Yes , he is quite the gentleman - born . His father is the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster - a good many miles from here . "

50443	50453	50437	50438	her companion	1256	" A very earnest clergyman , is he not ? "
50454	50508	50289	50290	The girl	647	" Yes - that he is - the earnestest man in all Wessex , they say - the last of the old Low Church sort , they tell me - for all about here be what they call High . All his sons , except our Mr Clare , be made pa'sons too . "

51048	51058	51059	51059	he	2166	" Oh , it has been misdirected , sir , "

51238	51328	51228	51229	the son	6347	" I should like to say , once for all , that I should prefer not to take Orders . I fear I could not conscientiously do so .

"
51484	51533	51535	51535	Angel	284	" No , father ; I can not underwrite Article Four leave alone the rest , taking it ' in the literal and grammatical sense ' as required by the Declaration ; and , therefore , I ca n't be a parson in the present state of affairs , "
51537	51587	51535	51535	Angel	284	" My whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction ; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews , ' the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which can not be shaken may remain . ' "

To think o ' the miles I 've vamped o ' starlight nights these last thirty year , courting , or trading , or for doctor , or for nurse , and yet never had the least notion o ' that till now , or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirt - collar . "
53739	53752	53753	53753	he	284	" What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is ! "
54247	54257	54258	54258	she	198	" Mr Clare , you have ranged the cows ! "
54300	54308	54310	54310	he	1900	" Well , it makes no difference , "
54312	54322	54310	54310	he	1900	" You will always be here to milk them . "
54323	54340	54350	54350	he	1900	" Do you think so ? I HOPE I shall ! But I do n't KNOW . "
55002	55014	55016	55016	he	284	" What makes you draw off in that way , Tess ? "
55018	55023	55016	55016	he	284	" Are you afraid ? "
55024	55052	54989	54989	his	284	" Oh no , sir - not of outdoor things ; especially just now when the apple - blooth is falling , and everything is so green . "
55053	55063	55016	55016	he	284	" But you have your indoor fears - eh ? "
55064	55071	54989	54989	his	284	" Well - yes , sir . "
55072	55076	55016	55016	he	284	" What of ? "
55077	55084	54989	54989	his	284	" I could n't quite say . "
55085	55091	55016	55016	he	284	" The milk turning sour ? "
55092	55095	54989	54989	his	284	" No . "

55102	55107	54989	54989	his	284	" Yes , sir . "
55108	55133	55016	55016	he	284	" Ah - so have I , very often . This hobble of being alive is rather serious , do n't you think so ? "
55134	55145	54989	54989	his	284	" It is - now you put it that way . "
55146	55174	55016	55016	he	284	" All the same , I should n't have expected a young girl like you to see it so just yet . How is it you do ? "
55181	55191	55195	55195	he	284	" Come , Tess , tell me in confidence . "
55210	55335	55195	55195	he	284	" The trees have inquisitive eyes , have n't they ? - that is , seem as if they had . And the river says , - ' Why do ye trouble me with your looks ? ' And you seem to see numbers of to - morrows just all in a line , the first of them the biggest and clearest , the others getting smaller and smaller as they stand farther away ; but they all seem very fierce and cruel and as if they said , ' I 'm coming ! Beware of me ! Beware of me ! ' ... But YOU , sir , can raise up dreams with your music , and drive all such horrid fancies away ! "

55975	55987	55988	55988	he	284	" Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden ? "
55991	56003	56004	56004	she	198	" Oh , ' tis only - about my own self , "
56018	56021	56004	56004	she	198	" a lady "
56024	56098	56004	56004	she	198	" Just a sense of what might have been with me ! My life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances ! When I see what you know , what you have read , and seen , and thought , I feel what a nothing I am ! I 'm like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible . There is no more spirit in me . "
56099	56113	56114	56114	he	284	" Bless my soul , do n't go troubling about that ! Why , "
56120	56155	56114	56114	he	284	" I should be only too glad , my dear Tess , to help you to anything in the way of history , or any line of reading you would like to take up - "
56156	56163	56165	56165	she	2319	" It is a lady again , "
56175	56178	56004	56004	she	198	" What ? "
56179	56197	56004	56004	she	198	" I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to peel them . "
56198	56223	56004	56004	she	198	" Never mind about the lords and ladies . Would you like to take up any course of study - history , for example ? "
56224	56243	56004	56004	she	198	" Sometimes I feel I do n't want to know anything more about it than I know already . "
56244	56248	56004	56004	she	198	" Why not ? "
56249	56341	56004	56004	she	198	" Because what 's the use of learning that I am one of a long row only - finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me , and to know that I shall only act her part ; making me sad , that 's all . The best is not to remember that your nature and your past doings have been just like thousands ' and thousands ' , and that your coming life and doings 'll be like thousands 's and thousands ' . "
56342	56357	56004	56004	she	198	" What , really , then , you do n't want to learn anything ? "
56358	56379	56380	56380	she	2320	" I should n't mind learning why - why the sun do shine on the just and the unjust alike , "
56391	56402	56388	56388	her	2320	" But that 's what books will not tell me . "
56403	56411	56414	56414	he	2321	" Tess , fie for such bitterness ! "
56752	56756	56758	56759	the dairyman	1900	" Mr Clare , "
56762	57113	56758	56759	the dairyman	1900	" is one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed - not a bit like the rest of his family ; and if there 's one thing that he do hate more than another ' tis the notion of what 's called a ' old family . He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days , and ca n't have anything left in 'em now . There 's the Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds , who used to own the lands for miles down this valley ; you could buy 'em all up now for an old song a'most . Why , our little Retty Priddle here , you know , is one of the Paridelles - the old family that used to own lots o ' the lands out by King 's Hintock , now owned by the Earl o ' Wessex , afore even he or his was heard of . Well , Mr Clare found this out , and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days . ' Ah ! ' he says to her , ' you 'll never make a good dairymaid ! All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine , and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds ! ' A boy came here t'other day asking for a job , and said his name was Matt , and when we asked him his surname he said he 'd never heard that ' a had any surname , and when we asked why , he said he supposed his folks had n't been ' stablished long enough . ' Ah ! you 're the very boy I want ! ' says Mr Clare , jumping up and shaking hands wi'en ; ' I 've great hopes of you ; ' and gave him half - a - crown . O no ! he ca n't stomach old families ! "
57544	57571	57572	57572	Tess	198	" Whither does this new current tend to carry me ? What does it mean to my future ? How does it stand towards my past ? "
58319	58324	58325	58325	she	2372	" Call me Tess , "
58797	58851	58769	58770	Dairyman Crick	276	" For Heaven 's sake , pop thy hands under the pump , Deb ! Upon my soul , if the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways , they 'd swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a'ready ; and that 's saying a good deal . "
59058	59075	59077	59078	the dairyman	1900	" ' Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle 's son in Egdon - years ! "
59081	59156	59077	59078	the dairyman	1900	" And he was nothing to what his father had been . I have said fifty times , if I have said once , that I DON'T believe in en ; though ' a do cast folks ' waters very true . But I shall have to go to ' n if he 's alive . O yes , I shall have to go to ' n , if this sort of thing continnys ! "
59170	59201	59203	59204	Jonathan Kail	278	" Conjuror Fall , t'other side of Casterbridge , that they used to call ' Wide - O ' , was a very good man when I was a boy , "
59206	59216	59203	59204	Jonathan Kail	278	" But he 's rotten as touchwood by now . "
59217	59246	59248	59249	Mr Crick	276	" My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne , out at Owlscombe , and a clever man a ' were , so I 've heard grandf'er say , "
59251	59262	59248	59249	Mr Crick	276	" But there 's no such genuine folk about nowadays ! "
59275	59285	59286	59286	she	283	" Perhaps somebody in the house is in love , "
59290	59329	59286	59286	she	283	" I 've heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it . Why , Crick - that maid we had years ago , do ye mind , and how the butter did n't come then - "
59330	59371	59372	59372	He	276	" Ah yes , yes ! - but that is n't the rights o't . It had nothing to do with the love - making . I can mind all about it - ' twas the damage to the churn . "
59377	59724	59372	59372	He	276	" Jack Dollop , a ' hore's - bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one time , sir , courted a young woman over at Mellstock , and deceived her as he had deceived many afore . But he had another sort o ' woman to reckon wi ' this time , and it was not the girl herself . One Holy Thursday of all days in the almanack , we was here as we mid be now , only there was no churning in hand , when we zid the girl 's mother coming up to the door , wi ' a great brass - mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha ' felled an ox , and saying ' Do Jack Dollop work here ? - because I want him ! I have a big bone to pick with he , I can assure ' n ! ' And some way behind her mother walked Jack 's young woman , crying bitterly into her handkercher . ' O Lard , here 's a time ! ' said Jack , looking out o ' winder at 'em . ' She 'll murder me ! Where shall I get - where shall I - ? Do n't tell her where I be ! ' And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap - door , and shut himself inside , just as the young woman 's mother busted into the milk - house . ' The villain - where is he ? ' says she . ' I 'll claw his face for'n , let me only catch him ! ' Well , she hunted about everywhere , ballyragging Jack by side and by seam , Jack lying a'most stifled inside the churn , and the poor maid - or young woman rather - standing at the door crying her eyes out . I shall never forget it , never ! ' Twould have melted a marble stone ! But she could n't find him nowhere at all . "
59778	60013	59773	59774	The narrator	2079	" Well , how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could never tell , but she found out that he was inside that there churn . Without saying a word she took hold of the winch it was turned by handpower then , and round she swung him , and Jack began to flop about inside . ' O Lard ! stop the churn ! let me out ! ' says he , popping out his head . ' I shall be churned into a pummy ! ' He was a cowardly chap in his heart , as such men mostly be . ' Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence ! ' says the old woman . ' Stop the churn you old witch ! ' screams he . ' You call me old witch , do ye , you deceiver ! ' says she , ' when ye ought to ha ' been calling me mother - law these last five months ! ' And on went the churn , and Jack 's bones rattled round again . Well , none of us ventured to interfere ; and at last ' a promised to make it right wi ' her . ' Yes - I 'll be as good as my word ! ' he said . And so it ended that day . "
60047	60056	60057	60057	she	198	" How warm ' tis to - day ! "
60096	60100	60101	60101	he	1900	" Why , maidy "
60114	60165	60101	60101	he	1900	" the prettiest milker I 've got in my dairy ; you must n't get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather , or we shall be finely put to for want of ' ee by dog - days , sha n't we , Mr Clare ? "
60166	60183	60184	60184	she	198	" I was faint - and - I think I am better out o ' doors , "
60214	60219	60221	60222	Mrs Crick	283	" ' Tis coming ! "
60604	60617	60619	60619	Retty	311	" Do n't push ! You can see as well as I , "
60637	60658	60663	60663	Marian	310	" ' Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me , Retty Priddle , "
60670	60680	60663	60663	Marian	310	" His thoughts be of other cheeks than thine ! "
60692	60698	60700	60701	Izz Huett	312	" There he is again ! "
60715	60724	60726	60726	Retty	311	" You need n't say anything , Izz , "
60728	60737	60726	60726	Retty	311	" For I zid you kissing his shade . "
60738	60746	60748	60748	Marian	310	" WHAT did you see her doing ? "
60750	60815	60726	60726	Retty	311	" Why - he was standing over the whey - tub to let off the whey , and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind , close to Izz , who was standing there filling a vat . She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth ; I zid her , though he did n't . "
60816	60821	60823	60823	Marian	310	" O Izz Huett ! "
60838	60848	60849	60849	she	310	" Well , there was no harm in it , "
60856	60882	60849	60849	she	310	" And if I be in love wi'en , so is Retty , too ; and so be you , Marian , come to that . "
60895	60898	60899	60899	she	310	" I ! "
60902	60924	60899	60899	she	310	" What a tale ! Ah , there he is again ! Dear eyes - dear face - dear Mr Clare ! "
60925	60933	60849	60849	she	310	" There - you 've owned it ! "
60934	60944	60946	60946	Marian	310	" So have you - so have we all , "
60958	60988	60946	60946	Marian	310	" It is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves , though we need not own it to other folks . I would just marry ' n to - morrow ! "
60989	60997	60999	61000	Izz Huett	312	" So would I - and more , "
61002	61007	61009	61012	the more timid Retty	311	" And I too , "
61019	61027	61029	61029	Izz	312	" We ca n't all marry him , "
61031	61045	61047	61048	the eldest	587	" We sha n't , either of us ; which is worse still , "
61050	61056	61047	61048	the eldest	587	" There he is again ! "
61066	61069	61071	61071	Retty	311	" Why ? "
61074	61082	61084	61084	Marian	310	" Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best , "

61111	61122	61126	61126	Retty	311	" But she do n't care anything for ' n ? "
61128	61137	61126	61126	Retty	311	" Well - I sometimes think that too . "
61138	61146	61148	61149	Izz Huett	312	" But how silly all this is ! "
61152	61203	61148	61149	Izz Huett	312	" Of course he wo n't marry any one of us , or Tess either - a gentleman 's son , who 's going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad ! More likely to ask us to come wi'en as farm - hands at so much a year ! "
61720	61729	61731	61732	the dairyman	1900	" And begad , so ' t have ! "
61752	61759	61731	61732	the dairyman	1900	" Yes - taste for yourself ! "
61845	61863	61904	61905	The dairyman	1900	" ' Tis garlic ! and I thought there was n't a blade left in that mead ! "
61921	61928	61929	61929	he	1900	" We must overhaul that mead , "
61932	61938	61929	61929	he	1900	" this must n't continny ! "

62325	62332	62333	62333	he	284	" Well , how are you ? "
62336	62345	62346	62346	she	198	" Very well , thank you , sir , "
62423	62442	62443	62443	he	2482	" Upon my soul and body , this here stooping do fairly make my back open and shut ! "
62457	62500	62443	62443	he	2482	" And you , maidy Tess , you was n't well a day or two ago - this will make your head ache finely ! Do n't do any more , if you feel fainty ; leave the rest to finish it . "
62551	62558	62559	62559	she	198	" Do n't they look pretty ? "
62562	62565	62559	62559	she	198	" Who ? "
62566	62572	62573	62573	Tess	198	" Izzy Huett and Retty . "
62605	62626	62559	62559	she	198	" Pretty ? Well , yes - they are pretty girls - fresh looking . I have often thought so . "
62627	62639	62683	62683	their	2484	" Though , poor dears , prettiness wo n't last long ! "
62640	62646	62559	62559	she	198	" O no , unfortunately . "
62647	62653	62683	62683	their	2484	" They are excellent dairywomen . "
62654	62663	62559	62559	she	198	" Yes : though not better than you . "
62664	62670	62683	62683	their	2484	" They skim better than I. "
62671	62675	62559	62559	she	198	" Do they ? "
62687	62693	62695	62695	Tess	198	" She is colouring up , "

62715	62723	62559	62559	she	198	" Because you are looking at her . "
62742	62768	62733	62733	Tess	198	" Marry one of them , if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady ; and do n't think of marrying me ! "

63903	63940	63941	63941	he	284	" It is the only way for you to get past . Stand still . Nonsense - you are not too heavy ! I 'd carry you all four together . Now , Marian , attend , "
63944	63965	63941	63941	he	284	" and put your arms round my shoulders , so . Now ! Hold on . That 's well done . "
64052	64057	64058	64058	she	310	" Here he comes , "
64073	64093	64058	64058	she	310	" And I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did . "
64094	64101	64103	64103	Tess	198	" There 's nothing in that , "
64106	64114	64116	64116	Izz	312	" There 's a time for everything , "
64120	64143	64116	64116	Izz	312	" A time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ; the first is now going to be mine . "
64144	64153	64103	64103	Tess	198	" Fie - it is Scripture , Izz ! "
64154	64157	64159	64159	Izz	312	" Yes , "
64161	64174	64159	64159	Izz	312	" I 've always a ' ear at church for pretty verses . "
64266	64274	64252	64252	he	284	" It will soon be you and I. "
64446	64476	64437	64437	she	198	" I may be able to clim ' along the bank perhaps - I can clim ' better than they . You must be so tired , Mr Clare ! "
64477	64484	64486	64486	he	284	" No , no , Tess , "
64508	64516	64517	64517	he	284	" Three Leahs to get one Rachel , "
64520	64528	64529	64529	she	198	" They are better women than I , "
64538	64543	64545	64545	Angel	284	" Not to me , "
64563	64572	64573	64573	she	198	" I hope I am not too heavy ? "
64577	64613	64547	64547	He	284	" O no . You should lift Marian ! Such a lump . You are like an undulating billow warmed by the sun . And all this fluff of muslin about you is the froth . "
64614	64628	64547	64547	He	284	" It is very pretty - if I seem like that to you . "
64629	64652	64547	64547	He	284	" Do you know that I have undergone three - quarters of this labour entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter ? "
64653	64656	64547	64547	He	284	" No . "
64657	64669	64547	64547	He	284	" I did not expect such an event to - day . "
64670	64681	64547	64547	He	284	" Nor I ... The water came up so sudden . "
64713	64717	64718	64718	he	284	" O Tessy ! "
64897	64911	64912	64912	She	310	" No - in all truth ; we have no chance against her ! "
64918	64924	64926	64927	the latter	462	" What do you mean ? "
64929	64970	64912	64912	She	310	" He likes ' ee best - the very best ! We could see it as he brought ' ee . He would have kissed ' ee , if you had encouraged him to do it , ever so little . "
64971	64976	64978	64978	she	198	" No , no , "
65108	65126	65127	65127	she	198	" I will never stand in your way , nor in the way of either of you ! "
65141	65183	65127	65127	she	198	" I ca n't help this , my dear ! I do n't think marrying is in his mind at all ; but if he were ever to ask me I should refuse him , as I should refuse any man . "
65184	65192	65194	65195	wondering Retty	311	" Oh ! would you ? Why ? "
65197	65227	65127	65127	she	198	" It can not be ! But I will be plain . Putting myself quite on one side , I do n't think he will choose either of you . "
65228	65239	65241	65241	Retty	311	" I have never expected it - thought of it ! "
65243	65253	65241	65241	Retty	311	" But O ! I wish I was dead ! "
65279	65287	65288	65288	she	2547	" We be friends with her again , "
65293	65306	65288	65288	she	2547	" She thinks no more of his choosing her than we do . "
65320	65332	65334	65334	Marian	310	" I do n't seem to care what I do now , "
65345	65388	65334	65334	Marian	310	" I was going to marry a dairyman at Stickleford , who 's asked me twice ; but - my soul - I would put an end to myself rather'n be his wife now ! Why do n't ye speak , Izz ? "
65389	65395	65397	65397	Izz	312	" To confess , then , "
65399	65457	65397	65397	Izz	312	" I made sure to - day that he was going to kiss me as he held me ; and I lay still against his breast , hoping and hoping , and never moved at all . But he did not . I do n't like biding here at Talbothays any longer ! I shall go hwome . "
65721	65729	65731	65731	one	6172	" B ' you awake , Tess ? "
65768	65773	65757	65757	Marian	310	" So be we ! "
65774	65794	65757	65757	Marian	310	" I wonder what she is like - the lady they say his family have looked out for him ! "
65795	65799	65801	65801	Izz	312	" I wonder , "
65803	65811	65813	65813	Tess	198	" Some lady looked out for him ? "
65817	65826	65813	65813	Tess	198	" I have never heard o ' that ! "
65827	65881	65757	65757	Marian	310	" O yes - ' tis whispered ; a young lady of his own rank , chosen by his family ; a Doctor of Divinity 's daughter near his father 's parish of Emminster ; he do n't much care for her , they say . But he is sure to marry her . "
67369	67376	67377	67377	he	284	" Forgive me , Tess dear ! "
67380	67420	67377	67377	he	284	" I ought to have asked . I - did not know what I was doing . I do not mean it as a liberty . I am devoted to you , Tessy , dearest , in all sincerity ! "
67458	67478	67480	67480	Tess	198	" She is angry - she does n't know what we mean - she 'll kick over the milk ! "
67537	67546	67547	67547	he	284	" Why do you cry , my darling ? "
67550	67558	67559	67559	she	198	" O - I do n't know ! "
67582	67596	67598	67598	he	284	" Well , I have betrayed my feeling , Tess , at last , "
67617	67673	67598	67598	he	284	" That I - love you dearly and truly I need not say . But I - it shall go no further now - it distresses you - I am as surprised as you are . You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness - been too quick and unreflecting , will you ? "
67674	67683	67684	67684	He	284	" N ' - I ca n't tell . "
68268	68271	68297	68297	her	2634	" Stay ! "
68885	68889	68891	68892	Dairyman Crick	276	" O no , "
68894	68912	68891	68892	Dairyman Crick	276	" Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi ' his kinsfolk . "
68949	68964	68966	68967	the dairyman	1900	" He 's getting on towards the end of his time wi ' me , "
68977	68992	68966	68967	the dairyman	1900	" and so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere . "
68993	69003	69005	69006	Izz Huett	312	" How much longer is he to bide here ? "
69070	69088	69090	69090	Crick	276	" Well , I ca n't mind the exact day without looking at my memorandum - book , "
69098	69143	69090	69090	Crick	276	" And even that may be altered a bit . He 'll bide to get a little practice in the calving out at the straw - yard , for certain . He 'll hang on till the end of the year I should say . "
69156	69162	69090	69090	Crick	276	" pleasure girdled about with pain "
71072	71088	71089	71089	Felix	202	" I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now , my dear fellow , "
71116	71169	71103	71103	he	202	" And , therefore , we must make the best of it . But I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals . Farming , of course , means roughing it externally ; but high thinking may go with plain living , nevertheless . "
71170	71176	71178	71178	Angel	284	" Of course it may , "
71180	71221	71178	71178	Angel	284	" Was it not proved nineteen hundred years ago - if I may trespass upon your domain a little ? Why should you think , Felix , that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals ? "
71222	71260	71103	71103	he	202	" Well , I fancied , from the tone of your letters and our conversation - it may be fancy only - that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp . Has n't it struck you , Cuthbert ? "
71261	71266	71268	71268	Angel	284	" Now , Felix , "
71271	71320	71268	71268	Angel	284	" we are very good friends , you know ; each of us treading our allotted circles ; but if it comes to intellectual grasp , I think you , as a contented dogmatist , had better leave mine alone , and inquire what has become of yours . "
71564	71580	71582	71582	Clare	200	" Ah ! you are looking for the black - puddings , my dear boy , "
71586	71665	71582	71582	Clare	200	" But I am sure you will not mind doing without them as I am sure your father and I shall not , when you know the reason . I suggested to him that we should take Mrs Crick 's kind present to the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his attacks of delirium tremens ; and he agreed that it would be a great pleasure to them ; so we did . "
71666	71670	71672	71672	Angel	200	" Of course , "
71681	71690	71692	71693	his mother	6090	" I found the mead so extremely alcoholic , "
71695	71729	71692	71693	his mother	6090	" that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage , but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency ; so I have put it in my medicine - closet . "
71730	71742	71744	71745	his father	457	" We never drink spirits at this table , on principle , "
71747	71758	71760	71760	Angel	200	" But what shall I tell the dairyman 's wife ? "
71762	71769	71771	71772	his father	457	" The truth , of course , "
71774	71812	71744	71745	his father	457	" I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black - puddings very much . She is a kind , jolly sort of body , and is sure to ask me directly I return . "
71813	71823	71824	71825	Mr Clare	284	" You can not , if we did not , "
71829	71844	71744	71745	his father	457	" Ah - no ; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple . "
71845	71849	71851	71851	Cuthbert	201	" A what ? "
71856	71869	71871	71871	Angel	284	" Oh - ' tis an expression they use down at Talbothays , "
72071	72079	72081	72082	his father	457	" As far as worldly wealth goes , "
72084	72100	72081	72082	his father	457	" you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years . "
72208	72229	72203	72203	Angel	284	" What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard - working farmer ? "
72230	72285	72203	72203	Angel	284	" A truly Christian woman , who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings - out and your comings - in . Beyond that , it really matters little . Such an one can be found ; indeed , my earnest - minded friend and neighbour , Dr Chant - "
72286	72337	72203	72203	Angel	284	" But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows , churn good butter , make immense cheeses ; know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear chickens , to direct a field of labourers in an emergency , and estimate the value of sheep and calves ? "
72338	72355	72203	72203	Angel	284	" Yes ; a farmer 's wife ; yes , certainly . It would be desirable . "
72371	72378	72379	72379	he	284	" I was going to add , "
72382	72519	72379	72379	he	284	" that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find one more to your true advantage , and certainly not more to your mother 's mind and my own , than your friend Mercy , whom you used to show a certain interest in . It is true that my neighbour Chant 's daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion - table - altar , as I was shocked to hear her call it one day - with flowers and other stuff on festival occasions . But her father , who is quite as opposed to such flummery as I , says that can be cured . It is a mere girlish outbreak which , I am sure , will not be permanent . "
72520	72586	72613	72615	the impulsive Angel	2817	" Yes , yes ; Mercy is good and devout , I know . But , father , do n't you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant , but one who , in place of that lady 's ecclesiastical accomplishments , understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself , would suit me infinitely better ? "
72746	72767	72769	72782	his startled mother , who had come softly into the study during the conversation	2826	" Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into - a lady , in short ? "
72784	72797	72799	72799	Angel	284	" She is not what in common parlance is called a lady , "
72803	72832	72799	72799	Angel	284	" for she is a cottager 's daughter , as I am proud to say . But she IS a lady , nevertheless - in feeling and nature . "
72833	72843	72769	72782	his startled mother , who had come softly into the study during the conversation	2826	" Mercy Chant is of a very good family . "
72844	72857	72859	72859	Angel	284	" Pooh ! - what 's the advantage of that , mother ? "
72862	72888	72859	72859	Angel	284	" How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have , and shall have to do ? "
72889	72900	72909	72909	her	6090	" Mercy is accomplished . And accomplishments have their charm , "
72913	73017	72769	72782	his startled mother , who had come softly into the study during the conversation	2826	" As to external accomplishments , what will be the use of them in the life I am going to lead ? - while as to her reading , I can take that in hand . She 'll be apt pupil enough , as you would say if you knew her . She 's brim full of poetry - actualized poetry , if I may use the expression . She LIVES what paper - poets only write ... And she is an unimpeachable Christian , I am sure ; perhaps of the very tribe , genus , and species you desire to propagate . "
73018	73026	72909	72909	her	6090	" O Angel , you are mocking ! "
73027	73080	73081	73081	Angel	284	" Mother , I beg pardon . But as she really does attend Church almost every Sunday morning , and is a good Christian girl , I am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality , and feel that I may do worse than choose her . "
73815	73818	73820	73821	Mr Clare	284	" Pernicious ! "
73914	73927	73929	73930	his son	2722	" Not one of the ancient d'Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places ? "
73932	73952	73929	73930	his son	2722	" That curiously historic worn - out family with its ghostly legend of the coach - and - four ? "
73953	74031	73890	73890	he	284	" O no . The original d'Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty years ago - at least , I believe so . This seems to be a new family which had taken the name ; for the credit of the former knightly line I hope they are spurious , I 'm sure . But it is odd to hear you express interest in old families . I thought you set less store by them even than I. "
74032	74043	74045	74045	Angel	284	" You misapprehend me , father ; you often do , "
74051	74101	74045	74045	Angel	284	" Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of their being old . Some of the wise even among themselves ' exclaim against their own succession , ' as Hamlet puts it ; but lyrically , dramatically , and even historically , I am tenderly attached to them . "
74248	74262	74245	74246	St Luke	352	" Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee ! "
74306	74310	74311	74311	he	284	" Dear father , "
74315	74330	74311	74311	he	284	" I wish you would not expose yourself to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels ! "
74331	74334	74339	74339	his	457	" Pain ? "
74351	74441	74339	74339	his	457	" The only pain to me was pain on his account , poor , foolish young man . Do you suppose his incensed words could give me any pain , or even his blows ? ' Being reviled we bless ; being persecuted we suffer it ; being defamed we entreat ; we are made as the filth of the world , and as the offscouring of all things unto this day . ' Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly true at this present hour . "
74442	74455	74311	74311	he	284	" Not blows , father ? He did not proceed to blows ? "
74456	74477	74339	74339	his	457	" No , he did not . Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state of intoxication . "
74478	74481	74311	74311	he	284	" No ! "
74482	74521	74339	74339	his	457	" A dozen times , my boy . What then ? I have saved them from the guilt of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby ; and they have lived to thank me , and praise God . "
74522	74531	74533	74533	Angel	284	" May this young man do the same ! "
74536	74547	74533	74533	Angel	284	" But I fear otherwise , from what you say . "
74548	74555	74557	74558	Mr Clare	284	" We 'll hope , nevertheless , "
74560	74608	74557	74558	Mr Clare	284	" And I continue to pray for him , though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again . But , after all , one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day . "
75417	75429	75414	75414	she	198	" O Mr Clare ! How you frightened me - I - "
75479	75485	75486	75486	he	284	" Dear , darling Tessy ! "
75503	75527	75486	75486	he	284	" Do n't , for Heaven 's sake , Mister me any more . I have hastened back so soon because of you ! "
75679	75689	75690	75690	she	198	" I 've got to go a - skimming , "
75693	75739	75690	75690	she	198	" and I have on'y old Deb to help me to - day . Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick , and Retty is not well , and the others are gone out somewhere , and wo n't be home till milking . "
75755	75763	75765	75766	Mr Clare	284	" I have come back , Deborah , "
75770	75802	75765	75766	Mr Clare	284	" So I can help Tess with the skimming ; and , as you are very tired , I am sure , you need n't come down till milking - time . "
75927	75940	75941	75941	he	284	" I may as well say it now as later , dearest , "
75945	76014	75941	75941	he	284	" I wish to ask you something of a very practical nature , which I have been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads . I shall soon want to marry , and , being a farmer , you see I shall require for my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms . Will you be that woman , Tessy ? "
76112	76129	76097	76097	she	2926	" O Mr Clare - I can not be your wife - I can not be ! "
76153	76158	76159	76159	he	284	" But , Tess ! "
76175	76186	76159	76159	he	284	" Do you say no ? Surely you love me ? "
76187	76206	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" O yes , yes ! And I would rather be yours than anybody 's in the world , "
76218	76225	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" But I CANNOT marry you ! "
76226	76229	76230	76230	he	284	" Tess , "
76240	76250	76230	76230	he	284	" you are engaged to marry some one else ! "
76251	76256	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" No , no ! "
76257	76265	76230	76230	he	284	" Then why do you refuse me ? "
76266	76293	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" I do n't want to marry ! I have not thought of doing it . I can not ! I only want to love you . "
76294	76298	76230	76230	he	284	" But why ? "
76306	76335	76303	76303	she	198	" Your father is a parson , and your mother wouldn ' like you to marry such as me . She will want you to marry a lady . "
76336	76354	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" Nonsense - I have spoken to them both . That was partly why I went home . "
76355	76366	76367	76367	she	198	" I feel I can not - never , never ! "
76370	76383	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" Is it too sudden to be asked thus , my Pretty ? "
76384	76393	76214	76216	the distressed girl	2928	" Yes - I did not expect it . "
76394	76412	76413	76413	he	2929	" If you will let it pass , please , Tessy , I will give you time , "
76416	76443	76413	76413	he	2929	" It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once . I 'll not allude to it again for a while . "
76540	76550	76551	76551	she	198	" I ca n't skim - I ca n't ! "
76615	76615	76608	76608	Tessy	256	"
76616	76622	76645	76645	Tess	198	" I do n't know . "
76623	76644	76608	76608	Tessy	256	" You go to church very regularly , and our parson here is not very High , they tell me . "
76680	76699	76700	76700	she	198	" I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I do , "
76707	76717	76700	76700	she	198	" It is often a great sorrow to me . "
76912	76925	76926	76926	she	198	" I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in , "
76941	77244	76926	76926	she	198	" Yes - well , my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles and difficulties , and the subject always tends to depress me . He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a different way of thinking from himself , and I do n't like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age , the more particularly as I do n't think earnestness does any good when carried so far . He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite recently . He went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge , a place forty miles from here , and made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about there - son of some landowner up that way - and who has a mother afflicted with blindness . My father addressed himself to the gentleman point - blank , and there was quite a disturbance . It was very foolish of my father , I must say , to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless . But whatever he thinks to be his duty , that he 'll do , in season or out of season ; and , of course , he makes many enemies , not only among the absolutely vicious , but among the easy - going , who hate being bothered . He says he glories in what happened , and that good may be done indirectly ; but I wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old , and would leave such pigs to their wallowing . "
77341	77348	77335	77335	he	457	" And my question , Tessy ? "
77349	77355	77357	77357	she	198	" O no - no ! "
77381	77386	77335	77335	he	457	" It CAN'T be ! "
77600	77652	77580	77580	he	457	" is by no means deemed waste ; love - making being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking , anxious homes of the ambitious , where a girl 's craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end .
77653	77669	77670	77670	he	457	" Tess , why did you say ' no ' in such a positive way ? "
77684	77707	77670	77670	he	457	" Do n't ask me . I told you why - partly . I am not good enough - not worthy enough . "
77708	77716	77670	77670	he	457	" How ? Not fine lady enough ? "
77717	77724	77726	77726	she	198	" Yes - something like that , "
77728	77735	77726	77726	she	198	" Your friends would scorn me . "
77736	77758	77759	77759	He	457	" Indeed , you mistake them - my father and mother . As for my brothers , I do n't care - "
77773	77851	77759	77759	He	457	" Now - you did not mean it , sweet ? - I am sure you did not ! You have made me so restless that I can not read , or play , or do anything . I am in no hurry , Tess , but I want to know - to hear from your own warm lips - that you will some day be mine - any time you may choose ; but some day ? "
77887	77934	77864	77864	Clare	284	" Then I ought not to hold you in this way - ought I ? I have no right to you - no right to seek out where you are , or walk with you ! Honestly , Tess , do you love any other man ? "
77935	77941	77942	77942	she	198	" How can you ask ? "
77951	77969	77864	77864	Clare	284	" I almost know that you do not . But then , why do you repulse me ? "
77970	78007	77864	77864	Clare	284	" I do n't repulse you . I like you to - tell me you love me ; and you may always tell me so as you go about with me - and never offend me . "
78008	78019	77864	77864	Clare	284	" But you will not accept me as a husband ? "
78020	78083	77864	77864	Clare	284	" Ah - that 's different - it is for your good , indeed , my dearest ! O , believe me , it is only for your sake ! I do n't like to give myself the great happiness o ' promising to be yours in that way - because - because I am SURE I ought not to do it . "
78084	78092	77864	77864	Clare	284	" But you will make me happy ! "
78093	78106	77864	77864	Clare	284	" Ah - you think so , but you do n't know ! "
78334	78345	78346	78346	she	2957	" Why do n't somebody tell him all about me ? "
78349	78368	78346	78346	she	2957	" It was only forty miles off - why has n't it reached here ? Somebody must know ! "
78701	78721	78722	78722	she	198	" Is coyness longer necessary ? Truth is truth between man and woman , as between man and man , "
78744	78755	78756	78756	he	284	" Do you know why I did that , Tess ? "
78759	78767	78734	78734	her	198	" Because you love me very much ! "
78768	78780	78786	78786	She	198	" Yes , and as a preliminary to a new entreaty . "
78781	78785	78734	78734	her	198	" Not AGAIN ! "
78802	78807	78808	78808	he	284	" O , Tessy ! "
78812	78887	78888	78888	he	284	" I CANNOT think why you are so tantalizing . Why do you disappoint me so ? You seem almost like a coquette , upon my life you do - a coquette of the first urban water ! They blow hot and blow cold , just as you do , and it is the very last sort of thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays . ... And yet , dearest , "
78900	78949	78888	78888	he	284	" I know you to be the most honest , spotless creature that ever lived . So how can I suppose you a flirt ? Tess , why do n't you like the idea of being my wife , if you love me as you seem to do ? "
78950	78976	79003	79003	he	284	" I have never said I do n't like the idea , and I never could say it ; because - it is n't true ! "
79013	79020	79021	79021	he	284	" Tell me , tell me ! "
79035	79049	79021	79021	he	284	" do tell me that you wo n't belong to anybody but me ! "
79050	79059	79060	79060	she	198	" I will , I will tell you ! "
79063	79094	79060	79060	she	198	" And I will give you a complete answer , if you will let me go now . I will tell you my experiences - all about myself - all ! "
79095	79108	79109	79109	He	284	" Your experiences , dear ; yes , certainly ; any number . "
79121	79173	79109	79109	He	284	" My Tess , no doubt , almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the garden hedge , that opened itself this morning for the first time . Tell me anything , but do n't use that wretched expression any more about not being worthy of me . "
79174	79195	79109	79109	He	284	" I will try - not ! And I 'll give you my reasons to - morrow - next week . "
79196	79201	79109	79109	He	284	" Say on Sunday ? "
79202	79208	79109	79109	He	284	" Yes , on Sunday . "
79445	79450	79430	79430	She	198	" waow - waow ! "
79671	79695	79696	79696	she	198	" I shall give way - I shall say yes - I shall let myself marry him - I can not help it ! "
79724	79763	79714	79716	the other girls	2428	" I ca n't bear to let anybody have him but me ! Yet it is a wrong to him , and may kill him when he knows ! O my heart - O - O - O ! "
79765	79781	79783	79784	Dairyman Crick	276	" Now , who mid ye think I 've heard news o ' this morning ? "
79807	79816	79787	79787	he	276	" Now , just who mid ye think ? "
79835	79838	79840	79841	the dairyman	1900	" Well , "
79843	79872	79840	79841	the dairyman	1900	" ' tis that slack - twisted ' hore's - bird of a feller , Jack Dollop . He 's lately got married to a widow - woman . "
79873	79887	79889	79890	a milker	2989	" Not Jack Dollop ? A villain - to think o ' that ! "
79935	79950	79952	79953	Angel Clare	284	" And had he married the valiant matron 's daughter , as he promised ? "
79986	79996	79998	79999	the dairyman	1900	" Not he , sir . Never meant to , "
80001	80109	79998	79999	the dairyman	1900	" As I say , ' tis a widow - woman , and she had money , it seems - fifty poun ' a year or so ; and that was all he was after . They were married in a great hurry ; and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun ' a year . Just fancy the state o ' my gentleman 's mind at that news ! Never such a cat - and - dog life as they 've been leading ever since ! Serves him well beright . But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst o't . "
80110	80132	80134	80135	Mrs Crick	283	" Well , the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her first man would trouble him , "
80137	80142	80144	80145	the dairyman	1900	" Ay , ay , "
80148	80188	80144	80145	the dairyman	1900	" Still , you can see exactly how ' twas . She wanted a home , and did n't like to run the risk of losing him . Do n't ye think that was something like it , maidens ? "
80197	80220	80222	80222	Marian	310	" She ought to ha ' told him just before they went to church , when he could hardly have backed out , "
80224	80230	80232	80232	Izz	2997	" Yes , she ought , "
80234	80251	80253	80253	Retty	311	" She must have seen what he was after , and should ha ' refused him , "
80256	80266	80268	80271	the dairyman of Tess	2998	" And what do you say , my dear ? "
80273	80299	80301	80301	Tess	198	" I think she ought - to have told him the true state of things - or else refused him - I do n't know , "
80312	80323	80325	80326	Beck Knibbs	321	" Be cust if I 'd have done either o't , "
80337	80412	80325	80326	Beck Knibbs	321	" All 's fair in love and war . I 'd ha ' married en just as she did , and if he 'd said two words to me about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that I had n't chose to tell , I 'd ha ' knocked him down wi ' the rolling - pin - a scram little feller like he ! Any woman could do it . "
80601	80604	80611	80611	Clare	284	" Tessy ! "
80622	80628	80611	80611	Clare	284	" My wife - soon ! "
80629	80654	80673	80673	he	284	" No , no ; I can not . For your sake , O Mr Clare ; for your sake , I say no ! "
80655	80658	80611	80611	Clare	284	" Tess ! "
80659	80665	80666	80666	she	198	" Still I say no ! "
80738	80740	80735	80735	she	198	" Yes "
80743	80745	80735	80735	she	198	" No "
81138	81146	81132	81132	Tess	198	" I can never be his wife , "
81367	81378	81379	81379	he	284	" Now , Miss Flirt , before you go down , "
81383	81452	81379	81379	he	284	" It is a fortnight since I spoke , and this wo n't do any longer . You MUST tell me what you mean , or I shall have to leave this house . My door was ajar just now , and I saw you . For your own safety I must go . You do n't know . Well ? Is it to be yes at last ? "
81453	81474	81475	81475	she	3023	" I am only just up , Mr Clare , and it is too early to take me to task ! "
81478	81522	81475	81475	she	3023	" You need not call me Flirt . ' Tis cruel and untrue . Wait till by and by . Please wait till by and by ! I will really think seriously about it between now and then . Let me go downstairs ! "
81551	81563	81540	81540	she	3023	" Call me Angel , then , and not Mr Clare . "
81564	81567	81529	81529	he	3024	" Angel . "
81568	81575	81540	81540	she	3023	" Angel dearest - why not ? "
81576	81588	81529	81529	he	3024	" ' Twould mean that I agree , would n't it ? "
81589	81619	81540	81540	she	3023	" It would only mean that you love me , even if you can not marry me ; and you were so good as to own that long ago . "
81620	81635	81636	81636	she	3023	" Very well , then , ' Angel dearest ' , if I MUST , "
81826	81840	81841	81841	he	284	" Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs , are they not ? "
81864	81873	81874	81874	she	3023	" Not so very different , I think , "
81877	81884	81841	81841	he	284	" Why do you think that ? "
81885	81899	81900	81900	Tess	198	" There are very few women 's lives that are not - tremulous , "
81914	81925	81900	81900	Tess	198	" There 's more in those three than you think . "
81926	81932	81900	81900	Tess	198	" What is in them ? "
81933	81939	81940	81940	she	3023	" Almost either of 'em , "
81943	81968	81940	81940	she	3023	" would make - perhaps would make - a properer wife than I. And perhaps they love you as well as I - almost . "
81969	81974	81900	81900	Tess	198	" O , Tessy ! "
82193	82203	82204	82204	he	276	" Why , ' tis later than I thought , "
82207	82265	82204	82204	he	276	" Begad ! We sha n't be soon enough with this milk at the station , if we do n't mind . There 's no time to - day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off . It must go to station straight from here . Who 'll drive it across ? "
82687	82698	82699	82699	she	2372	" I ought not to have come , I suppose , "
82707	82715	82717	82717	he	284	" I am sorry for the rain , "
82719	82730	82699	82699	she	2372	" But how glad I am to have you here ! "
82773	82791	82792	82792	he	284	" I am so afraid you will get cold , with nothing upon your arms and shoulders , "
82795	82829	82792	82792	he	284	" Creep close to me , and perhaps the drizzle wo n't hurt you much . I should be sorrier still if I did not think that the rain might be helping me . "
82881	82962	82836	82836	he	284	" Now we are all right again . Ah - no we are not ! It runs down into my neck a little , and it must still more into yours . That 's better . Your arms are like wet marble , Tess . Wipe them in the cloth . Now , if you stay quiet , you will not get another drop . Well , dear - about that question of mine - that long - standing question ? "
82999	83007	83031	83031	He	284	" Do you remember what you said ? "
83008	83012	83013	83013	she	198	" I do , "
83016	83024	83031	83031	He	284	" Before we get home , mind . "
83025	83030	83031	83031	He	284	" I 'll try . "
83067	83070	83071	83071	he	284	" That , "
83078	83145	83071	83071	he	284	" is an interesting old place - one of the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman family formerly of great influence in this county , the d'Urbervilles . I never pass one of their residences without thinking of them . There is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown , even if it was fierce , domineering , feudal renown . "
83146	83149	83151	83151	Tess	198	" Yes , "
83497	83513	83514	83514	she	198	" Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to - morrow , wo n't they ? "
83517	83526	83514	83514	she	198	" Strange people that we have never seen . "
83527	83560	83948	83948	his	3065	" Yes - I suppose they will . Though not as we send it . When its strength has been lowered , so that it may not get up into their heads . "
83561	83585	83514	83514	she	198	" Noble men and noble women , ambassadors and centurions , ladies and tradeswomen , and babies who have never seen a cow . "
83586	83596	83948	83948	his	3065	" Well , yes ; perhaps ; particularly centurions . "
83597	83636	83514	83514	she	198	" Who do n't know anything of us , and where it comes from ; or think how we two drove miles across the moor to - night in the rain that it might reach 'em in time ? "
83637	83709	83948	83948	his	3065	" We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners ; we drove a little on our own - on account of that anxious matter which you will , I am sure , set at rest , dear Tess . Now , permit me to put it in this way . You belong to me already , you know ; your heart , I mean . Does it not ? "
83710	83722	83514	83514	she	198	" You know as well as I. O yes - yes ! "
83723	83736	83948	83948	his	3065	" Then , if your heart does , why not your hand ? "
83737	83760	83514	83514	she	198	" My only reason was on account of you - on account of a question . I have something to tell you - "
83761	83778	83948	83948	his	3065	" But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness , and my worldly convenience also ? "
83779	83804	83514	83514	she	198	" O yes ; if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience . But my life before I came here - I want - "
83805	83877	83948	83948	his	3065	" Well , it is for my convenience as well as my happiness . If I have a very large farm , either English or colonial , you will be invaluable as a wife to me ; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the country . So please - please , dear Tessy , disabuse your mind of the feeling that you will stand in my way . "
83878	83905	83514	83514	she	198	" But my history . I want you to know it - you must let me tell you - you will not like me so well ! "
83906	83934	83948	83948	his	3065	" Tell it if you wish to , dearest . This precious history then . Yes , I was born at so and so , Anno Domini - "
83935	83942	83943	83943	she	3064	" I was born at Marlott , "
83960	84024	83943	83943	she	3064	" And I grew up there . And I was in the Sixth Standard when I left school , and they said I had great aptness , and should make a good teacher , so it was settled that I should be one . But there was trouble in my family ; father was not very industrious , and he drank a little . "
84025	84036	84037	84037	He	3065	" Yes , yes . Poor child ! Nothing new . "
84046	84066	84037	84037	He	3065	" And then - there is something very unusual about it - about me . I - I was - "
84072	84080	83943	83943	she	3064	" Yes , dearest . Never mind . "
84081	84120	83943	83943	she	3064	" I - I - am not a Durbeyfield , but a d'Urberville - a descendant of the same family as those that owned the old house we passed . And - we are all gone to nothing ! "
84121	84138	83943	83943	she	3064	" A d'Urberville ! - Indeed ! And is that all the trouble , dear Tess ? "
84139	84142	84143	84143	she	3064	" Yes , "
84147	84160	83943	83943	she	3064	" Well - why should I love you less after knowing this ? "
84161	84174	83943	83943	she	3064	" I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families . "
84178	84263	84175	84175	He	3066	" Well , it is true , in one sense . I do hate the aristocratic principle of blood before everything , and do think that as reasoners the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and virtuous , without regard to corporal paternity . But I am extremely interested in this news - you can have no idea how interested I am ! Are you not interested yourself in being one of that well - known line ? "
84264	84324	83943	83943	she	3064	" No . I have thought it sad - especially since coming here , and knowing that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to my father 's people . But other hills and field belonged to Retty 's people , and perhaps others to Marian 's , so that I do n't value it particularly . "
84325	84401	84419	84419	his	3068	" Yes - it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were once owners of it , and I sometimes wonder that a certain school of politicians do n't make capital of the circumstance ; but they do n't seem to know it ... I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name to d'Urberville , and trace the manifest corruption . And this was the carking secret ! "
84440	84444	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" Of course , "
84450	84611	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" I should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the long - suffering , dumb , unrecorded rank and file of the English nation , and not from the self - seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest . But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you , Tess he laughed as he spoke , and made selfish likewise . For your own sake I rejoice in your descent . Society is hopelessly snobbish , and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife , after I have made you the well - read woman that I mean to make you . My mother too , poor soul , will think so much better of you on account of it . Tess , you must spell your name correctly - d'Urberville - from this very day . "
84612	84621	84724	84724	She	3069	" I like the other way rather best . "
84622	84703	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" But you MUST , dearest ! Good heavens , why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession ! By the bye , there 's one of that kidney who has taken the name - where have I heard of him ? - Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase , I think . Why , he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of . What an odd coincidence ! "
84704	84723	84724	84724	She	3069	" Angel , I think I would rather not take the name ! It is unlucky , perhaps ! "
84728	84765	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" Now then , Mistress Teresa d'Urberville , I have you . Take my name , and so you will escape yours ! The secret is out , so why should you any longer refuse me ? "
84766	84798	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" If it is SURE to make you happy to have me as your wife , and you feel that you do wish to marry me , VERY , VERY much - "
84799	84808	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" I do , dearest , of course ! "
84809	84849	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" I mean , that it is only your wanting me very much , and being hardly able to keep alive without me , whatever my offences , that would make me feel I ought to say I will . "
84850	84871	84446	84448	the unwitting Clare	284	" You will - you do say it , I know ! You will be mine for ever and ever . "
84880	84883	84872	84872	He	3070	" Yes ! "
84923	84931	84872	84872	He	3070	" Why do you cry , dearest ? "
84932	84957	84884	84884	She	3071	" I ca n't tell - quite ! - I am so glad to think - of being yours , and making you happy ! "
84958	84972	84872	84872	He	3070	" But this does not seem very much like gladness , my Tessy ! "
84973	84995	84884	84884	She	3071	" I mean - I cry because I have broken down in my vow ! I said I would die unmarried ! "
84996	85012	84872	84872	He	3070	" But , if you love me you would like me to be your husband ? "
85013	85032	84884	84884	She	3071	" Yes , yes , yes ! But O , I sometimes wish I had never been born ! "
85033	85094	84872	84872	He	3070	" Now , my dear Tess , if I did not know that you are very much excited , and very inexperienced , I should say that remark was not very complimentary . How came you to wish that if you care for me ? Do you care for me ? I wish you would prove it in some way . "
85095	85107	85108	85108	she	3073	" How can I prove it more than I have done ? "
85117	85124	85108	85108	she	3073	" Will this prove it more ? "
85165	85173	85174	85174	she	3073	" There - now do you believe ? "
85184	85196	85174	85174	she	3073	" Yes . I never really doubted - never , never ! "
85242	85246	85292	85292	she	3073	" appetite for joy "
85283	85291	85292	85292	she	3073	" I must write to my mother , "
85295	85304	85292	85292	she	3073	" You do n't mind my doing that ? "
85305	85356	85292	85292	she	3073	" Of course not , dear child . You are a child to me , Tess , not to know how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time , and how wrong it would be in me to object . Where does she live ? "
85357	85373	85292	85292	she	3073	" At the same place - Marlott . On the further side of Blackmoor Vale . "
85374	85386	85292	85292	she	3073	" Ah , then I HAVE seen you before this summer - "
85387	85420	85292	85292	she	3073	" Yes ; at that dance on the green ; but you would not dance with me . O , I hope that is of no ill - omen for us now ! "
85793	85799	85801	85801	Tess	198	" O mother , mother ! "
86613	86616	86599	86599	Men	5841	" taking up "
86761	86774	86775	86775	she	3122	" You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them ! "
86779	86783	86717	86718	these watermen	3123	" O no ! "
86784	86810	86947	86947	She	3127	" But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that you are walking about like this with me , a milkmaid - "
86811	86819	86717	86718	these watermen	3123	" The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen . "
86820	86831	86947	86947	She	3127	" They might feel it a hurt to their dignity . "
86832	86946	86717	86718	these watermen	3123	" My dear girl - a d'Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare ! It is a grand card to play - that of your belonging to such a family , and I am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married , and have the proofs of your descent from Parson Tringham . Apart from that , my future is to be totally foreign to my family - it will not affect even the surface of their lives . We shall leave this part of England - perhaps England itself - and what does it matter how people regard us here ? You will like going , will you not ? "
87461	87475	87476	87476	she	3127	" I am not worthy of you - no , I am not ! "
87525	87587	87502	87502	Clare	284	" I wo n't have you speak like it , dear Tess ! Distinction does not consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions , but in being numbered among those who are true , and honest , and just , and pure , and lovely , and of good report - as you are , my Tess . "
87626	87668	87669	87669	she	3127	" Why did n't you stay and love me when I - was sixteen ; living with my little sisters and brothers , and you danced on the green ? O , why did n't you , why did n't you ! "
87720	87729	87730	87730	he	284	" Ah - why did n't I stay ! "
87733	87763	87730	87730	he	284	" That is just what I feel . If I had only known ! But you must not be so bitter in your regret - why should you be ? "
87775	87815	87771	87771	she	3127	" I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have now . Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done - I should have had so much longer happiness ! "
87938	87955	87956	87956	he	3127	" Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious , fitful , Tess ? "
87983	87998	87964	87964	he	3127	" I wanted to ask you something , and just then you ran away . "
87999	88007	88008	88008	she	3127	" Yes , perhaps I am capricious , "
88026	88043	88011	88011	She	3127	" No , Angel , I am not really so - by nature , I mean ! "
88080	88097	88098	88098	she	3127	" What did you want to ask me - I am sure I will answer it , "
88102	88131	88098	88098	she	3127	" Well , you love me , and have agreed to marry me , and hence there follows a thirdly , ' When shall the day be ? ' "
88132	88139	88098	88098	she	3127	" I like living like this . "
88140	88186	88098	88098	she	3127	" But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new year , or a little later . And before I get involved in the multifarious details of my new position , I should like to have secured my partner . "
88187	88190	88191	88191	she	3127	" But , "
88195	88232	88191	88191	she	3127	" to talk quite practically , would n't it be best not to marry till after all that ? - Though I ca n't bear the thought o ' your going away and leaving me here ! "
88233	88275	88098	88098	she	3127	" Of course you can not - and it is not best in this case . I want you to help me in many ways in making my start . When shall it be ? Why not a fortnight from now ? "
88276	88279	88280	88280	she	3127	" No , "
88286	88297	88280	88280	she	3127	" I have so many things to think of first . "
88298	88301	88302	88302	He	3149	" But - "
88383	88398	88399	88399	she	3127	" I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him ! "
88405	88442	88399	88399	she	3127	" I said to myself , they are sure to come and catch us ! But I was n't really sitting on his knee , though it might ha ' seemed as if I was almost ! "
88443	88476	88478	88479	the dairyman	1900	" Well - if so be you had n't told us , I am sure we should n't ha ' noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light , "
88504	88553	88481	88481	He	1900	" Now , Christianer , that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain't . O no , I should never ha ' thought a word of where she was a sitting to , if she had n't told me - not I. "
88554	88563	88565	88565	Clare	284	" We are going to be married soon , "
88571	88662	88481	88481	He	1900	" Ah - and be ye ! Well , I am truly glad to hear it , sir . I 've thought you mid do such a thing for some time . She 's too good for a dairymaid - I said so the very first day I zid her - and a prize for any man ; and what 's more , a wonderful woman for a gentleman - farmer 's wife ; he wo n't be at the mercy of his baily wi ' her at his side . "
88770	88778	88780	88780	Retty	311	" He 's going to marry her ! "
88788	88796	88780	88780	Retty	311	" How her face do show it ! "
88797	88805	88807	88807	Marian	310	" You BE going to marry him ? "
88809	88812	88814	88814	Tess	198	" Yes , "
88816	88819	88780	88780	Retty	311	" When ? "
88820	88824	88780	88780	Retty	311	" Some day . "
88833	88844	88846	88847	Izz Huett	312	" YES - going to MARRY him - a gentleman ! "
88916	88930	88932	88933	Izz Huett	312	" How it do seem ! Almost more than I can think of ! "
88939	88942	88943	88943	she	310	" Yes , "
88951	88970	88972	88972	Izz	312	" Was that because of love for her , or because other lips have touched there by now ? "
88977	88986	88988	88988	Marian	310	" I was n't thinking o ' that , "
88991	89067	88988	88988	Marian	310	" I was on'y feeling all the strangeness o't - that she is to be his wife , and nobody else . I do n't say nay to it , nor either of us , because we did not think of it - only loved him . Still , nobody else is to marry'n in the world - no fine lady , nobody in silks and satins ; but she who do live like we . "
89068	89080	89082	89082	Tess	198	" Are you sure you do n't dislike me for it ? "
89111	89122	89124	89125	Retty Priddle	311	" I do n't know - I do n't know , "
89127	89140	89124	89125	Retty Priddle	311	" I want to hate ' ee ; but I can not ! "
89141	89148	89150	89150	Izz	3166	" That 's how I feel , "
89154	89166	89150	89150	Izz	3166	" I ca n't hate her . Somehow she hinders me ! "
89167	89176	89178	89178	Tess	198	" He ought to marry one of you , "
89180	89183	89150	89150	Izz	3166	" Why ? "
89184	89191	89150	89150	Izz	3166	" You are all better than I. "
89192	89198	89200	89207	the girls in a low , slow whisper	3167	" We better than you ? "
89209	89217	89200	89207	the girls in a low , slow whisper	3167	" No , no , dear Tess ! "
89218	89222	89223	89223	she	198	" You are ! "
89255	89263	89245	89245	herself	198	" O yes , yes , yes ! "
89275	89285	89286	89286	she	198	" He ought to have had one of you ! "
89289	89321	89286	89286	she	198	" I think I ought to make him even now ! You would be better for him than - I do n't know what I 'm saying ! O ! O ! "
89339	89344	89346	89346	Marian	310	" Get some water , "
89348	89361	89346	89346	Marian	310	" She 's upset by us , poor thing , poor thing ! "
89380	89386	89388	89388	Marian	310	" You are best for'n , "
89390	89427	89388	89388	Marian	310	" More ladylike , and a better scholar than we , especially since he had taught ' ee so much . But even you ought to be proud . You BE proud , I 'm sure ! "
89428	89434	89435	89435	she	198	" Yes , I am , "
89438	89448	89435	89435	she	198	" and I am ashamed at so breaking down . "
89468	89531	89462	89462	Marian	310	" You will think of us when you be his wife , Tess , and of how we told ' ee that we loved him , and how we tried not to hate you , and did not hate you , and could not hate you , because you were his choice , and we never hoped to be chose by him . "
90093	90103	90105	90105	Tess	198	" It seems like tens of thousands of them , "
90107	90133	90105	90105	Tess	198	" holding public - meetings in their market - places , arguing , preaching , quarrelling , sobbing , groaning , praying , and cursing . "
90140	90163	90399	90399	his	3193	" Did Crick speak to you to - day , dear , about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months ? "
90164	90167	90399	90399	his	3193	" No . "
90168	90176	90399	90399	his	3193	" The cows are going dry rapidly . "
90177	90239	90399	90399	his	3193	" Yes . Six or seven went to the straw - barton yesterday , and three the day before , making nearly twenty in the straw already . Ah - is it that the farmer do n't want my help for the calving ? O , I am not wanted here any more ! And I have tried so hard to - "
90240	90348	90399	90399	his	3193	" Crick did n't exactly say that he would no longer require you . But , knowing what our relations were , he said in the most good - natured and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at Christmas I should take you with me , and on my asking what he would do without you he merely observed that , as a matter of fact , it was a time of year when he could do with a very little female help . I am afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand . "
90349	90383	90399	90399	his	3193	" I do n't think you ought to have felt glad , Angel . Because ' tis always mournful not to be wanted , even if at the same time ' tis convenient . "
90384	90396	90397	90397	He	3193	" Well , it is convenient - you have admitted that . "
90405	90408	90409	90409	he	3193	" Ah ! "
90412	90415	90399	90399	his	3193	" What ? "
90416	90446	90399	90399	his	3193	" I feel the red rising up at her having been caught ! But why should I trifle so ! We will not trifle - life is too serious . "
90447	90459	90399	90399	his	3193	" It is . Perhaps I saw that before you did . "
90544	90553	90554	90554	he	3193	" So that , seriously , dearest Tess , "
90614	90614	90600	90600	you	3194	"
90615	90654	90593	90599	the most uncalculating girl in the world	3202	" I wish we could . That it would always be summer and autumn , and you always courting me , and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summer - time ! "
90655	90660	90600	90600	you	3194	" I always shall . "
90661	90669	90670	90670	she	3194	" O , I know you will ! "
90682	90698	90670	90670	she	3194	" Angel , I will fix the day when I will become yours for always ! "
91273	91297	91298	91298	she	3225	" Do n't you think ' twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm ? "
91312	91337	91298	91298	she	3225	" To tell the truth , my Tess , I do n't like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy . "
91720	91742	91743	91743	he	284	" Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of London that I have heard of , "
91746	91763	91743	91743	he	284	" and by March or April we will pay a visit to my father and mother . "
91864	91873	91916	91917	The other	2085	" You was not called home this morning . "
91874	91877	91916	91917	The other	2085	" What ? "
91878	91893	91894	91894	she	3250	" It should ha ' been the first time of asking to - day , "
91902	91915	91894	91894	she	3250	" You meant to be married New Year 's Eve , deary ? "
91923	91943	91916	91917	The other	2085	" And there must be three times of asking . And now there be only two Sundays left between . "
92044	92059	92076	92076	he	284	" Have ye forgot 'em , Mr Clare ? The banns , I mean . "
92060	92069	92071	92071	Clare	284	" No , I have not forgot 'em , "
92084	92136	92080	92080	he	284	" Do n't let them tease you about the banns . A licence will be quieter for us , and I have decided on a licence without consulting you . So if you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own name , if you wished to . "
92137	92148	92149	92149	she	198	" I did n't wish to hear it , dearest , "
92197	92205	92206	92206	she	198	" I do n't quite feel easy , "
92211	92245	92206	92206	she	198	" All this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill . That 's how Heaven mostly does . I wish I could have had common banns ! "
92369	92376	92377	92377	she	198	" How thoughtful you 've been ! "
92386	92404	92377	92377	she	198	" Even to the gloves and handkerchief ! My own love - how good , how kind ! "
92405	92424	92436	92436	he	3261	" No , no , Tess ; just an order to a tradeswoman in London - nothing more . "
92956	92962	92964	92965	the other	2085	" A comely maid that , "
92967	92981	92983	92983	he	1380	" True , comely enough . But unless I make a great mistake - "
93117	93142	93102	93102	He	3306	" I beg pardon , sir ; ' twas a complete mistake . I thought she was another woman , forty miles from here . "
93234	93241	93243	93245	the second one	3314	" And was it a mistake ? "
93247	93268	93243	93245	the second one	3314	" Not a bit of it . But I did n't want to hurt the gentleman 's feelings - not I. "
93278	93290	93291	93291	Tess	198	" Could we put off our wedding till a little later ? "
93299	93306	93291	93291	Tess	198	" I mean if we wished ? "
93307	93331	93332	93332	he	3311	" No , my love . Calm yourself . Do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault ? "
93338	93354	93356	93356	she	198	" No - I only meant - if it should have to be put off . "
93402	93438	93399	93399	she	198	" We shall go away , a very long distance , hundreds of miles from these parts , and such as this can never happen again , and no ghost of the past reach there . "
93530	93537	93538	93538	he	3311	" Oh , nothing , dear , "
93543	93624	93538	93538	he	3311	" I am so sorry I disturbed you ! But the reason is rather an amusing one : I fell asleep and dreamt that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you , and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau , which I pulled out to - day for packing . I am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep . Go to bed and think of it no more . "
94126	94136	94139	94140	the dairyman	1900	" I was determined to do summat in honour o't "
94142	94188	94139	94140	the dairyman	1900	" And as you would n't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi ' fiddles and bass - viols complete , as we should ha ' done in old times , this was all I could think o ' as a noiseless thing . "
94825	94845	94846	94846	she	198	" I am so anxious to talk to you - I want to confess all my faults and blunders ! "
94852	94879	94880	94880	he	284	" No , no - we ca n't have faults talked of - you must be deemed perfect to - day at least , my Sweet ! "
94883	94911	94880	94880	he	284	" We shall have plenty of time , hereafter , I hope , to talk over our failings . I will confess mine at the same time . "
94912	94935	95036	95036	his	3365	" But it would be better for me to do it now , I think , so that you could not say - "
94936	94996	94880	94880	he	284	" Well , my quixotic one , you shall tell me anything - say , as soon as we are settled in our lodging ; not now . I , too , will tell you my faults then . But do not let us spoil the day with them ; they will be excellent matter for a dull time . "
94997	95008	95036	95036	his	3365	" Then you do n't wish me to , dearest ? "
95009	95018	94880	94880	he	284	" I do not , Tessy , really . "
95222	95224	95220	95226	a venerable " boy " of sixty	3374	" boy "
95932	95941	95943	95943	Clare	284	" I fancy you seem oppressed , Tessy , "
95945	95948	95949	95949	she	198	" Yes , "
95959	96008	95949	95949	she	198	" I tremble at many things . It is all so serious , Angel . Among other things I seem to have seen this carriage before , to be very well acquainted with it . It is very odd - I must have seen it in a dream . "
96009	96050	95910	95910	she	198	" Oh - you have heard the legend of the d'Urberville Coach - that well - known superstition of this county about your family when they were very popular here ; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it . "
96051	96062	96064	96064	she	198	" I have never heard of it to my knowledge , "
96066	96077	96064	96064	she	198	" What is the legend - may I know it ? "
96078	96160	95910	95910	she	198	" Well - I would rather not tell it in detail just now . A certain d'Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach ; and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach whenever - But I 'll tell you another day - it is rather gloomy . Evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan . "
96161	96170	96171	96171	she	198	" I do n't remember hearing it before , "
96174	96204	96171	96171	she	198	" Is it when we are going to die , Angel , that members of my family see it , or is it when we have committed a crime ? "
96205	96210	96211	96211	He	3406	" Now , Tess ! "
96373	96381	96370	96371	Friar Laurence	368	" These violent delights have violent ends . "
96400	96412	96413	96413	she	198	" O my love , why do I love you so ! "
96418	96442	96413	96413	she	198	" for she you love is not my real self , but one in my image ; the one I might have been ! "
96619	96638	96613	96613	She	198	" Will you kiss 'em all , once , poor things , for the first and last time ? "
96675	96677	96665	96665	he	1900	" Goodbye "
96854	96857	96859	96860	Mrs Crick	283	" Oh ? "
96862	96867	96859	96860	Mrs Crick	283	" An afternoon crow ! "
96881	96886	96887	96887	one	6172	" That 's bad , "
96919	96922	96924	96925	the dairyman	1900	" Well ! "
96927	96936	96938	96938	Tess	198	" I do n't like to hear him ! "
96943	96955	96938	96938	Tess	198	" Tell the man to drive on . Goodbye , goodbye ! "
96961	96978	96980	96981	the dairyman	1900	" Hoosh ! Just you be off , sir , or I 'll twist your neck ! "
97004	97031	96997	96998	his wife	819	" Now , to think o ' that just to - day ! I 've not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore . "
97032	97042	97044	97044	she	819	" It only means a change in the weather , "
97046	97056	97044	97044	she	819	" not what you think : ' tis impossible ! "
97155	97164	97166	97166	Clare	200	" Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions ! "
97307	97313	97315	97315	he	3453	" What 's the matter ? "
97317	97322	97323	97323	she	198	" Those horrid women ! "
97329	97335	97323	97323	she	198	" How they frightened me . "
97440	97446	97448	97448	Clare	200	" Whose portraits are those ? "
97453	97477	97478	97478	she	198	" I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d'Urberville family , the ancient lords of this manor , "
97481	97497	97478	97478	she	198	" Owing to their being builded into the wall they ca n't be moved away . "
97585	97595	97596	97596	he	3453	" Which are my fingers and which are yours ? "
97602	97609	97596	97596	he	3453	" They are very much mixed . "
97610	97616	97618	97618	she	198	" They are all yours , "
97800	97808	97809	97809	he	3453	" She is a dear dear Tess , "
97826	97922	97809	97809	he	3453	" Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune ? I think not . I think I could not , unless I were a woman myself . What I am in worldly estate , she is . What I become , she must become . What I can not be , she can not be . And shall I ever neglect her , or hurt her , or even forget to consider her ? God forbid such a crime ! "
98031	98042	98044	98044	Clare	200	" That cock knew the weather was going to change , "
98084	98092	98094	98094	Angel	200	" These old houses are so draughty , "
98110	98127	98094	98094	Angel	200	" I wonder where that luggage is . We have n't even a brush and comb . "
98128	98134	98135	98135	she	3479	" I do n't know , "
98142	98192	98196	98196	she	3479	" Tess , you are not a bit cheerful this evening - not at all as you used to be . Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you . I am sorry I brought you here . I wonder if you really love me , after all ? "
98238	98245	98247	98247	he	3481	" I did not mean it ! "
98251	98290	98247	98247	he	3481	" You are worried at not having your things , I know . I can not think why old Jonathan has not come with them . Why , it is seven o'clock ? Ah , there he is ! "
98326	98335	98336	98336	he	3481	" It is not Jonathan , after all , "
98339	98343	98345	98345	Tess	198	" How vexing ! "
98431	98436	98426	98427	his father	457	" Mrs Angel Clare . "
98437	98450	98452	98452	he	3481	" It is a little wedding - present for you , Tess , "
98459	98465	98452	98452	he	3481	" How thoughtful they are ! "
98476	98489	98491	98491	she	198	" I think I would rather have you open it , dearest , "
98498	98520	98491	98491	she	198	" I do n't like to break those great seals ; they look so serious . Please open it for me ! "
98739	98744	98746	98746	Clare	200	" I do remember , "
98748	98755	98746	98746	Clare	200	" but I had quite forgotten . "
98813	98818	98819	98819	she	198	" Are they mine ? "
98823	98829	98831	98831	he	3498	" They are , certainly , "
98926	98930	98931	98931	he	3498	" Yet why ? "
98983	98994	98978	98978	he	3498	" Tess , put them on - put them on ! "
99027	99037	99039	99039	Clare	200	" But the gown is n't right , Tess , "
99041	99057	99039	99039	Clare	200	" It ought to be a low one for a set of brilliants like that . "
99058	99062	99064	99064	Tess	198	" Ought it ? "
99066	99069	99071	99071	he	3498	" Yes , "
99138	99142	99144	99144	Clare	200	" My heavens , "
99146	99152	99144	99144	Clare	200	" how beautiful you are ! "
99251	99264	99265	99265	he	3498	" If you were only to appear in a ball - room ! "
99268	99306	99265	99265	he	3498	" But no - no , dearest ; I think I love you best in the wing - bonnet and cotton - frock - yes , better than in this , well as you support these dignities . "
99328	99335	99336	99336	she	198	" I 'll take them off , "
99339	99365	99336	99336	she	198	" in case Jonathan should see me . They are not fit for me , are they ? They must be sold , I suppose ? "
99366	99388	99336	99336	she	198	" Let them stay a few minutes longer . Sell them ? Never . It would be a breach of faith . "
99543	99555	99557	99558	Jonathan Kail	278	" I couldn ' make nobody hear at all by knocking , "
99567	99586	99563	99563	he	278	" and as't was raining out I opened the door . I 've brought the things , sir . "
99587	99602	99646	99646	He	278	" I am very glad to see them . But you are very late . "
99603	99610	99563	99563	he	278	" Well , yes , sir . "
99649	99695	99646	99646	He	278	" We 've all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha ' been a most terrible affliction since you and your Mis'ess - so to name her now - left us this a'ternoon . Perhaps you ha'nt forgot the cock 's afternoon crow ? "
99696	99703	99646	99646	He	278	" Dear me ; - what - "
99704	99735	99646	99646	He	278	" Well , some says it do mane one thing , and some another ; but what 's happened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown herself . "
99736	99751	99646	99646	He	278	" No ! Really ! Why , she bade us goodbye with the rest - "
99752	99950	99646	99646	He	278	" Yes . Well , sir , when you and your Mis'ess - so to name what she lawful is - when you two drove away , as I say , Retty and Marian put on their bonnets and went out ; and as there is not much doing now , being New Year 's Eve , and folks mops and brooms from what 's inside 'em , nobody took much notice . They went on to Lew - Everard , where they had summut to drink , and then on they vamped to Dree - armed Cross , and there they seemed to have parted , Retty striking across the water - meads as if for home , and Marian going on to the next village , where there 's another public - house . Nothing more was zeed or heard o ' Retty till the waterman , on his way home , noticed something by the Great Pool ; ' twas her bonnet and shawl packed up . In the water he found her . He and another man brought her home , thinking a ' was dead ; but she fetched round by degrees . "
100025	100099	100009	100009	her	819	" And , more than this , there 's Marian ; she 's been found dead drunk by the withy - bed - a girl who hev never been known to touch anything before except shilling ale ; though , to be sure , ' a was always a good trencher - woman , as her face showed . It seems as if the maids had all gone out o ' their minds ! "
100100	100104	100106	100106	Tess	198	" And Izz ? "
100108	100189	100009	100009	her	819	" Izz is about house as usual ; but ' a do say ' a can guess how it happened ; and she seems to be very low in mind about it , poor maid , as well she mid be . And so you see , sir , as all this happened just when we was packing your few traps and your Mis'ess 's night - rail and dressing things into the cart , why , it belated me . "
100190	100227	100009	100009	her	819	" Yes . Well , Jonathan , will you get the trunks upstairs , and drink a cup of ale , and hasten back as soon as you can , in case you should be wanted ? "
100393	100409	100410	100410	he	278	" I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls , "
100413	100431	100410	100410	he	278	" Still , do n't let it depress you . Retty was naturally morbid , you know . "
100432	100438	100440	100440	Tess	198	" Without the least cause , "
100442	100460	100440	100440	Tess	198	" While they who have cause to be , hide it , and pretend they are not . "
100657	100674	100675	100675	he	278	" Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults ? "
100686	100720	100681	100681	she	198	" We spoke lightly perhaps , and you may well have done so . But for me it was no light promise . I want to make a confession to you , Love . "
100740	100747	100748	100748	she	198	" You have to confess something ? "
100759	100812	100818	100818	He	278	" You did not expect it ? Ah - you thought too highly of me . Now listen . Put your head there , because I want you to forgive me , and not to be indignant with me for not telling you before , as perhaps I ought to have done . "
100835	100999	100831	100831	Clare	200	" I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance of you , darling , the great prize of my life - my Fellowship I call you . My brother 's Fellowship was won at his college , mine at Talbothays Dairy . Well , I would not risk it . I was going to tell you a month ago - at the time you agreed to be mine , but I could not ; I thought it might frighten you away from me . I put it off ; then I thought I would tell you yesterday , to give you a chance at least of escaping me . But I did not . And I did not this morning , when you proposed our confessing our faults on the landing - the sinner that I was ! But I must , now I see you sitting there so solemnly . I wonder if you will forgive me ? "
101000	101009	100831	100831	Clare	200	" O yes ! I am sure that - "
101010	101195	100831	100831	Clare	200	" Well , I hope so . But wait a minute . You do n't know . To begin at the beginning . Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one of the eternally lost for my doctrines , I am of course , a believer in good morals , Tess , as much as you . I used to wish to be a teacher of men , and it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not enter the Church . I admired spotlessness , even though I could lay no claim to it , and hated impurity , as I hope I do now . Whatever one may think of plenary inspiration , one must heartily subscribe to these words of Paul : ' Be thou an example - in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity . ' It is the only safeguard for us poor human beings . ' Integer vitae , ' says a Roman poet , who is strange company for St Paul -
101196	101216	100831	100831	Clare	200	" The man of upright life , from frailties free , Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow .
101217	101265	101266	101266	He	3531	" Well , a certain place is paved with good intentions , and having felt all that so strongly , you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in me when , in the midst of my fine aims for other people , I myself fell . "
101315	101328	101329	101329	he	3531	" Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly , "
101332	101385	101329	101329	he	3531	" I would have no more to say to her , and I came home . I have never repeated the offence . But I felt I should like to treat you with perfect frankness and honour , and I could not do so without telling this . Do you forgive me ? "
101395	101423	101386	101386	She	3532	" Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever ! - too painful as it is for the occasion - and talk of something lighter . "
101424	101461	101386	101386	She	3532	" O , Angel - I am almost glad - because now YOU can forgive ME ! I have not made my confession . I have a confession , too - remember , I said so . "
101462	101478	101386	101386	She	3532	" Ah , to be sure ! Now then for it , wicked little one . "
101479	101497	101386	101386	She	3532	" Perhaps , although you smile , it is as serious as yours , or more so . "
101498	101508	101386	101386	She	3532	" It can hardly be more serious , dearest . "
101509	101521	101522	101522	She	3532	" It can not - O no , it can not ! "
101530	101542	101543	101543	she	3532	" No , it can not be more serious , certainly , "
101546	101560	101543	101543	she	3532	" because ' tis just the same ! I will tell you now . "
102009	102012	101987	101987	he	3535	" Tess ! "
102013	102018	101987	101987	he	3535	" Yes , dearest . "
102019	102073	101987	101987	he	3535	" Am I to believe this ? From your manner I am to take it as true . O you can not be out of your mind ! You ought to be ! Yet you are not ... My wife , my Tess - nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that ? "
102074	102083	102084	102084	she	3532	" I am not out of my mind , "
102087	102091	102092	102092	He	3535	" And yet - "
102104	102135	102092	102092	He	3535	" Why did n't you tell me before ? Ah , yes , you would have told me , in a way - but I hindered you , I remember ! "
102215	102226	102227	102227	she	198	" In the name of our love , forgive me ! "
102234	102243	102227	102227	she	198	" I have forgiven you for the same ! "
102256	102270	102252	102252	she	198	" Forgive me as you are forgiven ! I forgive YOU , Angel . "
102271	102279	102252	102252	she	198	" You - yes , you do . "
102280	102288	102252	102252	she	198	" But you do not forgive me ? "
102289	102326	102252	102252	she	198	" O Tess , forgiveness does not apply to the case ! You were one person ; now you are another . My God - how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque - prestidigitation as that ! "
102351	102365	102366	102366	she	198	" Do n't - do n't ! It kills me quite , that ! "
102369	102379	102366	102366	she	198	" O have mercy upon me - have mercy ! "
102394	102407	102408	102408	she	198	" Angel , Angel ! what do you mean by that laugh ? "
102412	102422	102408	102408	she	198	" Do you know what this is to me ? "
102428	102476	102425	102425	his	3535	" I have been hoping , longing , praying , to make you happy ! I have thought what joy it will be to do it , what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not ! That 's what I have felt , Angel ! "
102477	102482	102425	102425	his	3535	" I know that . "
102483	102568	102425	102425	his	3535	" I thought , Angel , that you loved me - me , my very self ! If it is I you do love , O how can it be that you look and speak so ? It frightens me ! Having begun to love you , I love you for ever - in all changes , in all disgraces , because you are yourself . I ask no more . Then how can you , O my own husband , stop loving me ? "
102569	102583	102600	102600	his	3543	" I repeat , the woman I have been loving is not you . "
102584	102588	102425	102425	his	3535	" But who ? "
102589	102596	102600	102600	his	3543	" Another woman in your shape . "
102690	102697	102698	102698	he	3543	" Sit down , sit down , "
102702	102716	102698	102698	he	3543	" You are ill ; and it is natural that you should be . "
102747	102764	102765	102765	she	3542	" I do n't belong to you any more , then ; do I , Angel ? "
102769	102787	102765	102765	she	3542	" It is not me , but another woman like me that he loved , he says . "
102895	102898	102899	102899	she	3542	" Angel , "
102920	102935	102899	102899	she	3542	" Angel , am I too wicked for you and me to live together ? "
102936	102949	102899	102899	she	3542	" I have not been able to think what we can do . "
102950	103016	102899	102899	she	3542	" I sha n't ask you to let me live with you , Angel , because I have no right to ! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married , as I said I would do ; and I sha n't finish the good - hussif ' I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings . "
103017	103022	102899	102899	she	3542	" Sha n't you ? "
103023	103074	102899	102899	she	3542	" No , I sha n't do anything , unless you order me to ; and if you go away from me I shall not follow ' ee ; and if you never speak to me any more I shall not ask why , unless you tell me I may . "
103075	103085	102899	102899	she	3542	" And if I order you to do anything ? "
103086	103106	102899	102899	she	3542	" I will obey you like your wretched slave , even if it is to lie down and die . "
103107	103141	102899	102899	she	3542	" You are very good . But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self - sacrifice and your past mood of self - preservation . "
103296	103299	103300	103300	he	3548	" Tess , "
103310	103331	103300	103300	he	3548	" I can not stay - in this room - just now . I will walk out a little way . "
103891	103968	103884	103884	She	198	" What have I done - what HAVE I done ! I have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you . You do n't think I planned it , do you ? It is in your own mind what you are angry at , Angel ; it is not in me . O , it is not in me , and I am not that deceitful woman you think me ! "
103969	104016	104018	104018	she	3565	" H'm - well . Not deceitful , my wife ; but not the same . No , not the same . But do not make me reproach you . I have sworn that I will not ; and I will do everything to avoid it . "
104039	104062	104018	104018	she	3565	" Angel ! - Angel ! I was a child - a child when it happened ! I knew nothing of men . "
104063	104076	104018	104018	she	3565	" You were more sinned against than sinning , that I admit . "
104077	104085	104018	104018	she	3565	" Then will you not forgive me ? "
104086	104098	104018	104018	she	3565	" I do forgive you , but forgiveness is not all . "
104099	104104	104018	104018	she	3565	" And love me ? "
104113	104167	104018	104018	she	3565	" O Angel - my mother says that it sometimes happens so ! - she knows several cases where they were worse than I , and the husband has not minded it much - has got over it at least . And yet the woman had not loved him as I do you ! "
104168	104216	104018	104018	she	3565	" Do n't , Tess ; do n't argue . Different societies , different manners . You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman , who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things . You do n't know what you say . "
104217	104230	104018	104018	she	3565	" I am only a peasant by position , not by nature ! "
104246	104348	104018	104018	she	3565	" So much the worse for you . I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue . I can not help associating your decline as a family with this other fact - of your want of firmness . Decrepit families imply decrepit wills , decrepit conduct . Heaven , why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent ! Here was I thinking you a new - sprung child of nature ; there were you , the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy ! "
104349	104414	104425	104425	She	3567	" Lots of families are as bad as mine in that ! Retty 's family were once large landowners , and so were Dairyman Billett 's . And the Debbyhouses , who now are carters , were once the De Bayeux family . You find such as I everywhere ; ' tis a feature of our county , and I ca n't help it . "
104415	104424	104425	104425	She	3567	" So much the worse for the county . "
104621	104663	104614	104614	she	3567	" I do n't see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all your life . The river is down there . I can put an end to myself in it . I am not afraid . "
104664	104677	104678	104678	he	3569	" I do n't wish to add murder to my other follies , "
104681	104707	104614	104614	she	3567	" I will leave something to show that I did it myself - on account of my shame . They will not blame you then . "
104708	104795	104614	104614	she	3567	" Do n't speak so absurdly - I wish not to hear it . It is nonsense to have such thoughts in this kind of case , which is rather one for satirical laughter than for tragedy . You do n't in the least understand the quality of the mishap . It would be viewed in the light of a joke by nine - tenths of the world if it were known . Please oblige me by returning to the house , and going to bed . "
104796	104800	104802	104802	she	3569	" I will , "
105276	105280	105282	105282	Clare	200	" Thank God ! "
106025	106030	106002	106002	Angel	200	" Breakfast is ready ! "
106298	106301	106302	106302	she	198	" Angel ! "
106452	106468	106443	106443	he	3589	" Tess ! Say it is not true ! No , it is not true ! "
106469	106474	106485	106485	He	3589	" It is true . "
106475	106479	106443	106443	he	3589	" Every word ? "
106480	106484	106485	106485	He	3589	" Every word . "
106532	106537	106528	106528	she	198	" It is true . "
106538	106543	106544	106544	Angel	200	" Is he living ? "
106548	106553	106528	106528	she	198	" The baby died . "
106554	106559	106528	106528	she	198	" But the man ? "
106560	106565	106528	106528	she	198	" He is alive . "
106575	106581	106528	106528	she	198	" Is he in England ? "
106582	106585	106528	106528	she	198	" Yes . "
106593	106600	106601	106601	he	3589	" My position - is this , "
106605	106669	106601	106601	he	3589	" I thought - any man would have thought - that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social standing , with fortune , with knowledge of the world , I should secure rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks ; but - However , I am no man to reproach you , and I will not . "
106701	106744	106528	106528	she	198	" Angel - I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had not known that , after all , there was a last way out of it for you ; though I hoped you would never - "
106750	106755	106745	106745	Her	198	" A last way ? "
106756	106773	106745	106745	Her	198	" I mean , to get rid of me . You CAN get rid of me . "
106774	106777	106745	106745	Her	198	" How ? "
106778	106783	106745	106745	Her	198	" By divorcing me . "
106784	106801	106745	106745	Her	198	" Good heavens - how can you be so simple ! How can I divorce you ? "
106802	106824	106745	106745	Her	198	" Ca n't you - now I have told you ? I thought my confession would give you grounds for that . "
106825	106864	106745	106745	Her	198	" O Tess - you are too , too - childish - unformed - crude , I suppose ! I do n't know what you are . You do n't understand the law - you do n't understand ! "
106865	106872	106745	106745	Her	198	" What - you can not ? "
106873	106879	106745	106745	Her	198	" Indeed I can not . "
106893	106900	106901	106901	she	3627	" I thought - I thought , "
106904	106971	106901	106901	she	3627	" O , now I see how wicked I seem to you ! Believe me - believe me , on my soul , I never thought but that you could ! I hoped you would not ; yet I believed , without a doubt , that you could cast me off if you were determined , and did n't love me at - at - all ! "
106972	106977	106978	106978	he	3628	" You were mistaken , "
106981	107012	106901	106901	she	3627	" O , then I ought to have done it , to have done it last night ! But I had n't the courage . That 's just like me ! "
107013	107020	106901	106901	she	3627	" The courage to do what ? "
107033	107041	107042	107042	he	3628	" What were you thinking of doing ? "
107045	107053	106901	106901	she	3627	" Of putting an end to myself . "
107054	107057	107026	107026	he	3628	" When ? "
107067	107071	107072	107072	she	3629	" Last night , "
107075	107078	106901	106901	she	3627	" Where ? "
107079	107084	106901	106901	she	3627	" Under your mistletoe . "
107085	107092	107093	107093	he	3628	" My good - ! How ? "
107097	107112	107113	107113	she	3629	" I 'll tell you , if you wo n't be angry with me ! "
107118	107151	107113	107113	she	3629	" It was with the cord of my box . But I could not - do the last thing ! I was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name . "
107191	107227	107188	107188	he	3628	" Now , listen to this . You must not dare to think of such a horrible thing ! How could you ! You will promise me as your husband to attempt that no more . "
107228	107242	107188	107188	he	3628	" I am ready to promise . I saw how wicked it was . "
107243	107255	107188	107188	he	3628	" Wicked ! The idea was unworthy of you beyond description . "
107256	107261	107262	107262	she	3629	" But , Angel , "
107274	107396	107262	107262	she	3629	" it was thought of entirely on your account - to set you free without the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to get . I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine . However , to do it with my own hand is too good for me , after all . It is you , my ruined husband , who ought to strike the blow . I think I should love you more , if that were possible , if you could bring yourself to do it , since there 's no other way of escape for ' ee . I feel I am so utterly worthless ! So very greatly in the way ! "
107397	107400	107188	107188	he	3628	" Ssh ! "
107401	107421	107262	107262	she	3629	" Well , since you say no , I wo n't . I have no wish opposed to yours . "
107768	107772	107773	107773	he	3630	" How punctual ! "
107776	107787	107789	107789	she	198	" Yes . I saw you coming over the bridge , "
107939	107947	107948	107948	he	3630	" You must not work like this , "
107951	107963	107948	107948	he	3630	" You are not my servant ; you are my wife . "
107973	107982	107983	107983	she	198	" I may think myself that - indeed ? "
107990	108007	107983	107983	she	198	" You mean in name ! Well , I do n't want to be anything more . "
108008	108024	107964	107964	She	198	" You MAY think so , Tess ! You are . What do you mean ? "
108025	108031	108032	108032	she	198	" I do n't know , "
108042	108088	108032	108032	she	198	" I thought I - because I am not respectable , I mean . I told you I thought I was not respectable enough long ago - and on that account I did n't want to marry you , only - only you urged me ! "
108232	108246	108247	108247	he	3655	" I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you , "
108260	108274	108247	108247	he	3655	" It is n't a question of respectability , but one of principle ! "
108498	108501	108496	108496	he	3655	" Goodbye , "
108540	108547	108523	108523	He	3655	" I shall be home punctually . "
108631	108682	108621	108621	He	3655	" You know , I have to think of a course . It was imperative that we should stay together a little while , to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting . But you must see it is only for form 's sake . "
108683	108686	108688	108688	Tess	198	" Yes , "
108903	108916	108896	108896	He	3655	" What 's to be done - what 's to be done ? "
108939	108959	108960	108960	she	198	" I suppose - you are not going to live with me - long , are you , Angel ? "
108989	108993	108994	108994	he	3655	" I can not "
108997	109230	108994	108994	he	3655	" without despising myself , and what is worse , perhaps , despising you . I mean , of course , can not live with you in the ordinary sense . At present , whatever I feel , I do not despise you . And , let me speak plainly , or you may not see all my difficulties . How can we live together while that man lives ? - he being your husband in nature , and not I. If he were dead it might be different ... Besides , that 's not all the difficulty ; it lies in another consideration - one bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves . Think of years to come , and children being born to us , and this past matter getting known - for it must get known . There is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere . Well , think of wretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding years . What an awakening for them ! What a prospect ! Can you honestly say ' Remain ' after contemplating this contingency ? Do n't you think we had better endure the ills we have than fly to others ? "
109243	109252	109253	109253	she	3673	" I can not say ' Remain , ' "
109256	109268	109253	109253	she	3673	" I can not ; I had not thought so far . "
109505	109511	109492	109495	M. Sully - Prudhomme	377	" You shall be born , "
109624	109650	109618	109618	She	200	" On an Australian upland or Texan plain , who is to know or care about my misfortunes , or to reproach me or you ? "
109840	109849	109850	109850	she	200	" I have thought over what you say , "
109879	109900	109850	109850	she	200	" It is quite true , all of it ; it must be . You must go away from me . "
109901	109908	109850	109850	she	200	" But what can you do ? "
109909	109915	109850	109850	she	200	" I can go home . "
109923	109928	109929	109929	he	3675	" Are you sure ? "
109932	110002	109850	109850	she	200	" Quite sure . We ought to part , and we may as well get it past and done . You once said that I was apt to win men against their better judgement ; and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish ; and afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible . "
110003	110012	110013	110013	he	3675	" And you would like to go home ? "
110016	110027	109850	109850	she	200	" I want to leave you , and go home . "
110028	110035	109850	109850	she	200	" Then it shall be so . "
110067	110076	110077	110077	she	3689	" I feared it would come to this , "
110085	110191	110077	110077	she	3689	" I do n't complain , Angel , I - I think it best . What you said has quite convinced me . Yes , though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together , yet somewhen , years hence , you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter , and knowing what you do of my bygones , you yourself might be tempted to say words , and they might be overheard , perhaps by my own children . O , what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then ! I will go - to - morrow . "
110192	110244	110245	110245	Tess	198	" And I shall not stay here . Though I did n't like to initiate it , I have seen that it was advisable we should part - at least for a while , till I can better see the shape that things have taken , and can write to you . "
110336	110349	110333	110333	he	791	" I think of people more kindly when I am away from them "
110354	110375	110333	110333	he	791	" God knows ; perhaps we will shake down together some day , for weariness ; thousands have done it ! "
110707	110714	110696	110696	he	791	" Dead ! dead ! dead ! "
110849	110856	110857	110857	he	791	" Dead , dead , dead ! "
110924	110946	110915	110915	he	791	" My poor , poor Tess - my dearest , darling Tess ! So sweet , so good , so true ! "
111034	111042	111043	111043	he	791	" My wife - dead , dead ! "
112262	112270	112245	112245	she	198	" Let us walk on , darling , "
113459	113461	113456	113456	their	3756	" we "
113517	113584	113510	113511	Mrs Crick	283	" How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem , and how they stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream ! Did n't it strike ' ee that ' twas so ? Tess had always sommat strange in her , and she 's not now quite like the proud young bride of a well - be - doing man . "
113740	113749	113750	113750	he	3791	" Now , let us understand each other , "
113754	113843	113750	113750	he	3791	" There is no anger between us , though there is that which I can not endure at present . I will try to bring myself to endure it . I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself . And if I can bring myself to bear it - if it is desirable , possible - I will come to you . But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me . "
113919	113934	113910	113910	She	198	" Until you come to me I must not try to come to you ? "
113935	113939	113910	113910	She	198	" Just so . "
113940	113947	113910	113910	She	198	" May I write to you ? "
113948	113984	113910	113910	She	198	" O yes - if you are ill , or want anything at all . I hope that will not be the case ; so that it may happen that I write first to you . "
113985	114019	113910	113910	She	198	" I agree to the conditions , Angel ; because you know best what my punishment ought to be ; only - only - do n't make it more than I can bear ! "
114520	114527	114528	114528	he	3824	" Oh - nothing , miss , "
114531	114699	114528	114528	he	3824	" Marlott is Marlott still . Folks have died and that . John Durbeyfield , too , hev had a daughter married this week to a gentleman - farmer ; not from John 's own house , you know ; they was married elsewhere ; the gentleman being of that high standing that John 's own folk was not considered well - be - doing enough to have any part in it , the bridegroom seeming not to know how't have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood , with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day , but done out of his property in the time o ' the Romans . However , Sir John , as we call ' n now , kept up the wedding - day as well as he could , and stood treat to everybody in the parish ; and John 's wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o'clock . "
114910	114919	114899	114900	her friend	3163	" But where 's thy gentleman , Tess ? "
115046	115075	114999	114999	she	658	" Why - Tess ! - my chil ' - I thought you was married ! - married really and truly this time - we sent the cider - "
115076	115085	114999	114999	she	658	" Yes , mother ; so I am . "
115086	115091	114999	114999	she	658	" Going to be ? "
115092	115099	114999	114999	she	658	" No - I am married . "
115100	115109	114999	114999	she	658	" Married ! Then where 's thy husband ? "
115110	115121	114999	114999	she	658	" Oh , he 's gone away for a time . "
115122	115138	114999	114999	she	658	" Gone away ! When was you married , then ? The day you said ? "
115139	115146	114999	114999	she	658	" Yes , Tuesday , mother . "
115147	115160	114999	114999	she	658	" And now ' tis on'y Saturday , and he gone away ? "
115161	115168	114999	114999	she	658	" Yes , he 's gone . "
115169	115192	114999	114999	she	658	" What 's the meaning o ' that ? ' Nation seize such husbands as you seem to get , say I ! "
115193	115196	115197	115197	Tess	198	" Mother ! "
115218	115266	114999	114999	she	658	" I do n't know how to tell ' ee , mother ! You said to me , and wrote to me , that I was not to tell him . But I did tell him - I could n't help it - and he went away ! "
115267	115277	115280	115281	Mrs Durbeyfield	180	" O you little fool - you little fool ! "
115291	115317	115286	115286	herself	198	" My good God ! that ever I should ha ' lived to say it , but I say it again , you little fool ! "
115335	115346	115347	115347	she	198	" I know it - I know - I know ! "
115353	115418	115347	115347	she	198	" But , O my mother , I could not help it ! He was so good - and I felt the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened ! If - if - it were to be done again - I should do the same . I could not - I dared not - so sin - against him ! "
115419	115429	115318	115318	Tess	198	" But you sinned enough to marry him first ! "
115430	115510	115347	115347	she	198	" Yes , yes ; that 's where my misery do lie ! But I thought he could get rid o ' me by law if he were determined not to overlook it . And O , if you knew - if you could only half know how I loved him - how anxious I was to have him - and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him ! "
115533	115596	115318	115318	Tess	198	" Well , well ; what 's done ca n't be undone ! I 'm sure I do n't know why children o ' my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than other people 's - not to know better than to blab such a thing as that , when he could n't ha ' found it out till too late ! "
115614	115625	115626	115626	she	180	" What your father will say I do n't know , "
115629	115685	115626	115626	she	180	" for he 's been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver 's and The Pure Drop every day since , and about his family getting back to their rightful position through you - poor silly man ! - and now you 've made this mess of it ! The Lord - a - Lord ! "
115940	115950	115951	115951	Durbeyfield	180	" We 've just had up a story about - "
115988	116002	116003	116003	he	1861	" They was formerly styled ' sir ' , like my own ancestry , "
116006	116022	116003	116003	he	1861	" though nowadays their true style , strictly speaking , is ' clerk ' only . "
116157	116172	116174	116175	Sir John	177	" To think , now , that this was to be the end o't ! "
116177	116322	116174	116175	Sir John	177	" And I with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as big as Squire Jollard 's ale - cellar , and my folk lying there in sixes and sevens , as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history . And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver 's and The Pure Drop will say to me ! How they 'll squint and glane , and say , ' This is yer mighty match is it ; this is yer getting back to the true level of yer forefathers in King Norman 's time ! ' I feel this is too much , Joan ; I shall put an end to myself , title and all - I can bear it no longer ! ... But she can make him keep her if he 's married her ? "
116323	116338	116125	116125	Durbeyfield	180	" Why , yes . But she wo n't think o ' doing that . "
116339	116356	116174	116175	Sir John	177	" D'ye think he really have married her ? - or is it like the first - "
116928	116939	116941	116943	the Pagan moralist	3903	" This is the chief thing : be not perturbed , "
116958	116972	116974	116975	the Nazarene	384	" Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid , "
117489	117500	117502	117503	his mother	6090	" But - where 's your wife , dear Angel ? "
117505	117511	117502	117503	his mother	6090	" How you surprise us ! "
117512	117539	117478	117478	Angel	200	" She is at her mother 's - temporarily . I have come home rather in a hurry because I 've decided to go to Brazil . "
117540	117552	117502	117503	his mother	6090	" Brazil ! Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely ! "
117553	117564	117478	117478	Angel	200	" Are they ? I had n't thought of that . "
117596	117612	117614	117615	Mrs Clare	200	" We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken place , "
117617	117820	117614	117615	Mrs Clare	200	" and your father sent your godmother 's gift to her , as you know . Of course it was best that none of us should be present , especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy , and not at her home , wherever that may be . It would have embarrassed you , and given us no pleasure . Your bothers felt that very strongly . Now it is done we do not complain , particularly if she suits you for the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the Gospel . ... Yet I wish I could have seen her first , Angel , or have known a little more about her . We sent her no present of our own , not knowing what would best give her pleasure , but you must suppose it only delayed . Angel , there is no irritation in my mind or your father 's against you for this marriage ; but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her . And now you have not brought her . It seems strange . What has happened ? "
117849	117860	117861	117861	he	3940	" I do n't mind telling you , dear mother , "
117864	117930	117861	117861	he	3940	" that I always meant to keep her away from this house till I should feel she could some with credit to you . But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent one . If I do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey . She will remain at her mother 's till I come back . "
117931	117942	117943	117943	He	3940	" And I shall not see her before you start ? "
118110	118127	118102	118102	She	6090	" Can not you describe her ? I am sure she is very pretty , Angel . "
118128	118137	118138	118138	he	6089	" Of that there can be no question ! "
118149	118161	118102	118102	She	6090	" And that she is pure and virtuous goes without question ? "
118162	118173	118102	118102	She	6090	" Pure and virtuous , of course , she is . "
118174	118231	118102	118102	She	6090	" I can see her quite distinctly . You said the other day that she was fine in figure ; roundly built ; had deep red lips like Cupid 's bow ; dark eyelashes and brows , an immense rope of hair like a ship 's cable ; and large eyes violety - bluey - blackish . "
118232	118238	118102	118102	She	6090	" I did , mother . "
118239	118268	118102	118102	She	6090	" I quite see her . And living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you . "
118269	118272	118102	118102	She	6090	" Scarcely . "
118273	118280	118102	118102	She	6090	" You were her first love ? "
118281	118285	118102	118102	She	6090	" Of course . "
118286	118339	118102	118102	She	6090	" There are worse wives than these simple , rosy - mouthed , robust girls of the farm . Certainly I could have wished - well , since my son is to be an agriculturist , it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been accustomed to an outdoor life . "
118372	118411	118365	118366	the Vicar	1858	" I think , since Angel has come , that it will be more appropriate to read the thirty - first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should have had in the usual course of our reading ? "
118412	118417	118419	118420	Mrs Clare	200	" Yes , certainly , "
118422	118428	118419	118420	Mrs Clare	200	" The words of King Lemuel "
118441	118489	118429	118429	she	200	" My dear son , your father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise of a virtuous wife . We shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to the absent one . May Heaven shield her in all her ways ! "
118539	118645	118524	118524	Angel	200	" Who can find a virtuous woman ? for her price is far above rubies . She riseth while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household . She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms . She perceiveth that her merchandise is good ; her candle goeth not out by night . She looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness . Her children arise up and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her . Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all . "
118655	118784	118651	118652	his mother	6090	" I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father read applied , in some of its particulars , to the woman you have chosen . The perfect woman , you see , was a working woman ; not an idler ; not a fine lady ; but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for the good of others . ' Her children arise up and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her . Many daughters have done virtuously , but she excelleth them all . ' Well , I wish I could have seen her , Angel . Since she is pure and chaste , she would have been refined enough for me . "
118882	118885	118886	118886	she	6090	" Angel , "
118889	118910	118886	118886	she	6090	" is there something wrong that you go away so soon ? I am quite sure you are not yourself . "
118911	118920	118922	118922	he	3962	" I am not , quite , mother , "
118924	118954	118886	118886	she	6090	" About her ? Now , my son , I know it is that - I know it is about her ! Have you quarrelled in these three weeks ? "
118955	118962	118963	118963	he	3962	" We have not exactly quarrelled , "
118966	118974	118963	118963	he	3962	" But we have had a difference - "
118975	118989	118886	118886	she	6090	" Angel - is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation ? "
119019	119024	119025	119025	he	3962	" She is spotless ! "
119049	119102	119016	119016	her	200	" Then never mind the rest . After all , there are few purer things in nature then an unsullied country maid . Any crudeness of manner which may offend your more educated sense at first , will , I am sure , disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition . "
119697	119714	119715	119715	he	3962	" Yes ; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense , no doubt , "
119718	119739	119715	119715	he	3962	" But , my dear Mercy , it snaps the continuity of existence . Perhaps a cloister would be preferable . "
119740	119749	119673	119673	She	330	" A cloister ! O , Angel Clare ! "
119750	119753	119715	119715	he	3962	" Well ? "
119754	119773	119673	119673	She	330	" Why , you wicked man , a cloister implies a monk , and a monk Roman Catholicism . "
119774	119794	119715	119715	he	3962	" And Roman Catholicism sin , and sin damnation . Thou art in a parlous state , Angel Clare . "
119795	119802	119803	119803	she	330	" I glory in my Protestantism ! "
119876	119880	119881	119881	he	3962	" Dear Mercy , "
119884	119897	119881	119881	he	3962	" you must forgive me . I think I am going crazy ! "
120412	120430	120431	120431	he	3962	" O Tess ! If you had only told me sooner , I would have forgiven you ! "
120479	120483	120484	120484	she	1028	" Mr Clare , "
120487	120515	120484	120484	she	1028	" I 've called to see you and Mrs Clare , and to inquire if ye be well . I thought you might be back here again . "
120562	120568	120569	120569	he	3962	" I am here alone , "
120572	120580	120569	120569	he	3962	" we are not living here now . "
120590	120600	120587	120587	he	3962	" Which way are you going home , Izz ? "
120601	120613	120614	120614	she	198	" I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now , sir , "
120617	120622	120587	120587	he	3962	" Why is that ? "
120627	120644	120645	120645	She	198	" It was so dismal there that I left ! I am staying out this way . "
120660	120680	120587	120587	he	3962	" Well - are you going there now ? I can take you if you wish for a lift . "
120689	120697	120698	120698	she	198	" Thank ' ee , Mr Clare , "
120750	120760	120761	120761	he	3962	" I am going to leave England , Izz , "
120769	120774	120761	120761	he	3962	" Going to Brazil . "
120775	120788	120789	120789	she	198	" And do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey ? "
120792	120822	120761	120761	he	3962	" She is not going at present - say for a year or so . I am going out to reconnoitre - to see what life there is like . "
120837	120843	120844	120844	he	3962	" How are the others ? "
120847	120852	120844	120844	he	3962	" How is Retty ? "
120853	120896	120898	120898	Izz	312	" She was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her last ; and so thin and hollow - cheeked that ' a do seem in a decline . Nobody will ever fall in love wi ' her any more , "
120901	120905	120844	120844	he	3962	" And Marian ? "
120911	120915	120908	120908	her	312	" Marian drinks . "
120916	120919	120908	120908	her	312	" Indeed ! "
120920	120931	120908	120908	her	312	" Yes . The dairyman has got rid of her . "
120932	120936	120908	120908	her	312	" And you ! "
120937	120963	120908	120908	her	312	" I do n't drink , and I bain't in a decline . But - I am no great things at singing afore breakfast now ! "
120964	120978	120908	120908	her	312	" How is that ? Do you remember how neatly you used to turn "
120997	120997	120908	120908	her	312	"
120998	121022	120908	120908	her	312	" Ah , yes ! When you first came , sir , that was . Not when you had been there a bit . "
121023	121031	120908	120908	her	312	" Why was that falling - off ? "
121048	121062	121063	121063	he	4028	" Izz ! - how weak of you - for such as I ! "
121071	121083	121063	121063	he	4028	" Then - suppose I had asked YOU to marry me ? "
121084	121108	120908	120908	her	312	" If you had I should have said ' Yes ' , and you would have married a woman who loved ' ee ! "
121109	121112	121063	121063	he	4028	" Really ! "
121113	121119	121120	121120	she	312	" Down to the ground ! "
121124	121137	121120	121120	she	312	" O my God ! did you never guess it till now ! "
121152	121163	121165	121165	Izz	312	" I must get down . I live out there , "
121238	121248	121250	121250	he	4028	" I am going to Brazil alone , Izz , "
121252	121295	121250	121250	he	4028	" I have separated from my wife for personal , not voyaging , reasons . I may never live with her again . I may not be able to love you ; but - will you go with me instead of her ? "
121296	121304	121463	121463	He	4034	" You truly wish me to go ? "
121305	121328	121250	121250	he	4028	" I do . I have been badly used enough to wish for relief . And you at least love me disinterestedly . "
121329	121336	121338	121338	Izz	312	" Yes - I will go , "
121344	121356	121250	121250	he	4028	" You will ? You know what it means , Izz ? "
121357	121381	121250	121250	he	4028	" It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over there - that 's good enough for me . "
121382	121422	121250	121250	he	4028	" Remember , you are not to trust me in morals now . But I ought to remind you that it will be wrong - doing in the eyes of civilization - Western civilization , that is to say . "
121423	121448	121250	121250	he	4028	" I do n't mind that ; no woman do when it comes to agony - point , and there 's no other way ! "
121449	121462	121250	121250	he	4028	" Then do n't get down , but sit where you are . "
121484	121495	121496	121496	he	4034	" You love me very , very much , Izz ? "
121500	121523	121250	121250	he	4028	" I do - I have said I do ! I loved you all the time we was at the dairy together ! "
121524	121529	121530	121530	She	4034	" More than Tess ? "
121535	121538	121539	121539	she	4034	" No , "
121542	121548	121539	121539	she	4034	" not more than she . "
121549	121554	121250	121250	he	4028	" How 's that ? "
121555	121585	121539	121539	she	4034	" Because nobody could love ' ee more than Tess did ! ... She would have laid down her life for ' ee . I could do no more . "
121660	121678	121656	121656	His	4037	" SHE WOULD HAVE LAID DOWN HER LIFE FOR ' EE . I COULD DO NO MORE ! "
121679	121687	121688	121688	he	4037	" Forget our idle talk , Izz , "
121698	121722	121688	121688	he	4037	" I do n't know what I 've been saying ! I will now drive you back to where your lane branches off . "
121723	121748	121656	121656	His	4037	" So much for honesty towards ' ee ! O - how can I bear it - how can I - how can I ! "
121768	121794	121761	121761	she	312	" Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one ? O , Izz , do n't spoil it by regret ! "
121801	121835	121795	121795	She	312	" Very well , sir . Perhaps I did n't know what I was saying , either , wh - when I agreed to go ! I wish - what can not be ! "
121836	121845	121795	121795	She	312	" Because I have a loving wife already . "
121846	121854	121795	121795	She	312	" Yes , yes ! You have ! "
121876	121887	121888	121888	he	4040	" Izz - please , please forget my momentary levity ! "
121891	121904	121888	121888	he	4040	" It was so ill - considered , so ill - advised ! "
121905	121922	121923	121923	He	4040	" Forget it ? Never , never ! O , it was no levity to me ! "
121953	121978	121923	121923	He	4040	" Well , but , Izz , we 'll part friends , anyhow ? You do n't know what I 've had to bear ! "
121996	122004	122005	122005	she	312	" I forgive ' ee , sir ! "
122008	122013	122014	122014	he	4040	" Now , Izz , "
122037	122209	122018	122018	she	312	" I want you to tell Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman , and not to give way to folly . Promise that , and tell Retty that there are more worthy men than I in the world , that for my sake she is to act wisely and well - remember the words - wisely and well - for my sake . I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying ; for I shall never see them again . And you , Izzy , you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery . Women may be bad , but they are not so bad as men in these things ! On that one account I can never forget you . Be always the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been ; and think of me as a worthless lover , but a faithful friend . Promise . "
122215	122226	122227	122227	He	4044	" Heaven bless and keep you , sir . Goodbye ! "
124474	124481	124466	124466	He	1337	" Good night , my pretty maid "
124517	124554	124508	124509	The man	1516	" Why , surely , it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile - young Squire d'Urberville 's friend ? I was there at that time , though I do n't live there now . "
124594	124644	124588	124588	she	198	" Be honest enough to own it , and that what I said in the town was true , though your fancy - man was so up about it - hey , my sly one ? You ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his , considering . "
124863	124868	124869	124869	She	198	" All is vanity . "
124996	125003	125004	125004	she	4149	" I wish it were now , "
125616	125639	125640	125640	she	198	" Poor darlings - to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o ' such misery as yours ! "
125654	125687	125640	125640	she	198	" And not a twinge of bodily pain about me ! I be not mangled , and I be not bleeding , and I have two hands to feed and clothe me . "
126027	126035	126037	126045	the next man who met her to a companion	4175	" What a mommet of a maid ! "
126062	126069	126070	126070	she	198	" But I do n't care ! "
126073	126145	126070	126070	she	198	" O no - I do n't care ! I 'll always be ugly now , because Angel is not here , and I have nobody to take care of me . My husband that was is gone away , and never will love me any more ; but I love him just the same , and hate all other men , and like to make 'em think scornfully of me ! "
126833	126843	126844	126844	she	198	" Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare ! "
127133	127179	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Tess - Mrs Clare - the dear wife of dear he ! And is it really so bad as this , my child ? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way ? Anybody been beating ' ee ? Not HE ? "
127180	127200	127351	127351	Marian	310	" No , no , no ! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled , Marian . "
127215	127223	127224	127224	Tess	198	" And you 've got no collar on "
127238	127245	127351	127351	Marian	310	" I know it , Marian . "
127246	127253	127351	127351	Marian	310	" You 've lost it travelling . "
127254	127283	127351	127351	Marian	310	" I 've not lost it . The truth is , I do n't care anything about my looks ; and so I did n't put it on . "
127284	127295	127351	127351	Marian	310	" And you do n't wear your wedding - ring ? "
127296	127350	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Yes , I do ; but not in public . I wear it round my neck on a ribbon . I do n't wish people to think who I am by marriage , or that I am married at all ; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life . "
127354	127375	127351	127351	Marian	310	" But you BE a gentleman 's wife ; and it seems hardly fair that you should live like this ! "
127376	127391	127351	127351	Marian	310	" O yes it is , quite fair ; though I am very unhappy . "
127392	127407	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Well , well . HE married you - and you can be unhappy ! "
127408	127425	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Wives are unhappy sometimes ; from no fault of their husbands - from their own . "
127426	127454	127351	127351	Marian	310	" You 've no faults , deary ; that I 'm sure of . And he 's none . So it must be something outside ye both . "
127455	127521	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Marian , dear Marian , will you do me a good turn without asking questions ? My husband has gone abroad , and somehow I have overrun my allowance , so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time . Do not call me Mrs Clare , but Tess , as before . Do they want a hand here ? "
127522	127573	127351	127351	Marian	310	" O yes ; they 'll take one always , because few care to come . ' Tis a starve - acre place . Corn and swedes are all they grow . Though I be here myself , I feel ' tis a pity for such as you to come . "
127574	127586	127351	127351	Marian	310	" But you used to be as good a dairywoman as I. "
127587	127642	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Yes ; but I 've got out o ' that since I took to drink . Lord , that 's the only comfort I 've got now ! If you engage , you 'll be set swede - hacking . That 's what I be doing ; but you wo n't like it . "
127643	127654	127351	127351	Marian	310	" O - anything ! Will you speak for me ? "
127655	127665	127351	127351	Marian	310	" You will do better by speaking for yourself . "
127666	127698	127351	127351	Marian	310	" Very well . Now , Marian , remember - nothing about HIM if I get the place . I do n't wish to bring his name down to the dirt . "
127719	127726	127727	127727	she	310	" This is pay - night , "
127730	127793	127727	127727	she	310	" and if you were to come with me you would know at once . I be real sorry that you are not happy ; but ' tis because he 's away , I know . You could n't be unhappy if he were here , even if he gie'd ye no money - even if he used you like a drudge . "
127794	127803	127351	127351	Marian	310	" That 's true ; I could not ! "
128465	128467	128452	128452	their	815	" wroppers "
128896	128920	128922	128922	Marian	310	" You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o ' Froom Valley from here when ' tis fine , "
128924	128930	128932	128932	Tess	198	" Ah ! Can you ? "
129036	129044	129045	129045	she	198	" I 've got used to it , "
129048	129081	129045	129045	she	198	" and ca n't leave it off now . ' Tis my only comfort - You see I lost him : you did n't ; and you can do without it perhaps . "
129315	129318	129320	129320	Marian	310	" Ah , "
129322	129385	129320	129320	Marian	310	" how I should like another or two of our old set to come here ! Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here afield , and talk of he , and of what nice times we had there , and o ' the old things we used to know , and make it all come back a'most , in seeming ! "
129401	129409	129410	129410	she	310	" I 'll write to Izz Huett , "
129413	129449	129410	129410	she	310	" She 's biding at home doing nothing now , I know , and I 'll tell her we be here , and ask her to come ; and perhaps Retty is well enough now . "
130334	130348	130350	130350	Marian	310	" Ha - ha ! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming , "
130352	130421	130350	130350	Marian	310	" Depend upon't , they keep just in front o't all the way from the North Star . Your husband , my dear , is , I make no doubt , having scorching weather all this time . Lord , if he could only see his pretty wife now ! Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all - in fact , it rather does it good . "
130422	130434	130436	130436	Tess	198	" You must n't talk about him to me , Marian , "
130439	130452	130350	130350	Marian	310	" Well , but - surely you care for'n ! Do you ? "
130496	130593	130350	130350	Marian	310	" Well , well , I know you do . But ' pon my body , it is a rum life for a married couple ! There - I wo n't say another word ! Well , as for the weather , it wo n't hurt us in the wheat - barn ; but reed - drawing is fearful hard work - worse than swede - hacking . I can stand it because I 'm stout ; but you be slimmer than I. I ca n't think why maister should have set ' ee at it . "
130660	130667	130669	130669	Marian	310	" Why , here 's Izz ! "
131134	131216	131217	131217	He	1947	" So you be the young woman who took my civility in such ill part ? Be drowned if I did n't think you might be as soon as I heard of your being hired ! Well , you thought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancy - man , and the second time on the road , when you bolted ; but now I think I 've got the better you . "
131309	131377	131535	131535	He	4332	" You thought I was in love with ' ee I suppose ? Some women are such fools , to take every look as serious earnest . But there 's nothing like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o ' young wenches ' heads ; and you 've signed and agreed till Lady - Day . Now , are you going to beg my pardon ? "
131378	131387	131300	131300	man	970	" I think you ought to beg mine . "
131388	131417	131535	131535	He	4332	" Very well - as you like . But we 'll see which is master here . Be they all the sheaves you 've done to - day ? "
131418	131423	131300	131300	man	970	" Yes , sir . "
131424	131440	131535	131535	He	4332	" ' Tis a very poor show . Just see what they 've done over there "
131448	131460	131535	131535	He	4332	" The rest , too , have done better than you . "
131461	131499	131300	131300	man	970	" They 've all practised it before , and I have not . And I thought it made no difference to you as it is task work , and we are only paid for what we do . "
131500	131513	131535	131535	He	4332	" Oh , but it does . I want the barn cleared . "
131514	131534	131535	131535	He	4332	" I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do . "
131647	131658	131644	131644	Marian	310	" Now , we 've got it all to ourselves . "
131688	131693	131695	131697	Mrs Angel Clare	200	" Izz and Marian , "
131717	131764	131695	131697	Mrs Angel Clare	200	" I ca n't join in talk with you now , as I used to do , about Mr Clare ; you will see that I can not ; because , although he is gone away from me for the present , he is my husband . "
131784	131795	131796	131796	she	200	" He was a very splendid lover , no doubt , "
131799	131819	131796	131796	she	200	" but I do n't think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon . "
131820	131840	131842	131842	Tess	198	" He had to go - he was obliged to go , to see about the land over there ! "
131844	131855	131796	131796	she	200	" He might have tided ' ee over the winter . "
131856	131876	131877	131877	Tess	198	" Ah - that 's owing to an accident - a misunderstanding ; and we wo n't argue it , "
131886	131923	131883	131883	her	198	" Perhaps there 's a good deal to be said for him ! He did not go away , like some husbands , without telling me ; and I can always find out where he is . "
132005	132017	132019	132019	Marian	310	" I knew you would n't be able to stand it ! "
132021	132032	132019	132019	Marian	310	" It wants harder flesh than yours for this work . "
132039	132053	132054	132054	he	1947	" Oh , that 's how you get on when I am away , "
132059	132067	132068	132068	she	198	" But it is my own loss , "
132071	132075	132068	132068	she	198	" Not yours . "
132076	132082	132083	132083	he	1947	" I want it finished , "
132100	132113	132115	132115	Marian	310	" Do n't ' ee mind him , there 's a dear , "
132117	132142	132115	132115	Marian	310	" I 've worked here before . Now you go and lie down there , and Izz and I will make up your number . "
132143	132162	132068	132068	she	198	" I do n't like to let you do that . I 'm taller than you , too . "
132477	132489	132490	132490	she	310	" I should not have thought it of him - never ! "
132497	132520	132490	132490	she	310	" And I loved him so ! I did n't mind his having YOU . But this about Izz is too bad ! "
132542	132549	132550	132550	she	198	" Is it about my husband ? "
132553	132600	132550	132550	she	198	" Well , yes . Izz said , ' Do n't ' ee tell her ' ; but I am sure I ca n't help it ! It was what he wanted Izz to do . He wanted her to go off to Brazil with him . "
132617	132625	132626	132626	she	198	" And did Izz refuse to go ? "
132629	132641	132601	132601	Tess	198	" I do n't know . Anyhow he changed his mind . "
132642	132660	132601	132601	Tess	198	" Pooh - then he did n't mean it ! ' Twas just a man 's jest ! "
132661	132678	132601	132601	Tess	198	" Yes he did ; for he drove her a good - ways towards the station . "
132679	132686	132601	132601	Tess	198	" He did n't take her ! "
132704	132707	132709	132709	Marian	310	" There ! "
132711	132722	132709	132709	Marian	310	" Now I wish I had n't told ' ee ! "
132723	132819	132601	132601	Tess	198	" No . It is a very good thing that you have done ! I have been living on in a thirtover , lackaday way , and have not seen what it may lead to ! I ought to have sent him a letter oftener . He said I could not go to him , but he did n't say I was not to write as often as I liked . I wo n't dally like this any longer ! I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him ! "
133616	133638	133640	133641	Izz Huett	312	" ' Tis a thousand pities your husband ca n't see ' ee now - you do look a real beauty ! "
134143	134148	134189	134189	she	312	" The Devil 's Kitchen "
135376	135387	135371	135373	one of them	1380	" There is Mercy Chant . Let us overtake her . "
135451	135523	135443	135446	one of the brothers	4462	" Ah ! poor Angel , poor Angel ! I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid , or whatever she may be . It is a queer business , apparently . Whether she has joined him yet or not I do n't know ; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him . "
135524	135558	135443	135446	one of the brothers	4462	" I ca n't say . He never tells me anything nowadays . His ill - considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions . "
135693	135702	135703	135703	he	4473	" Here 's a pair of old boots , "
135706	135719	135703	135703	he	4473	" Thrown away , I suppose , by some tramp or other . "
135720	135740	135742	135743	Miss Chant	330	" Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot , perhaps , and so excite our sympathies , "
135745	135784	135742	135743	Miss Chant	330	" Yes , it must have been , for they are excellent walking - boots - by no means worn out . What a wicked thing to do ! I 'll carry them home for some poor person . "
136041	136044	136045	136045	she	4267	" Ah ! "
136055	136134	136045	136045	she	4267	" THEY did n't know that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these pretty ones HE bought for me - no - they did not know it ! And they did n't think that HE chose the colour o ' my pretty frock - no - how could they ? If they had known perhaps they would not have cared , for they do n't care much for him , poor thing ! "
136426	136435	136436	136436	she	4267	" It is nothing - it is nothing ! "
136439	136459	136436	136436	she	4267	" Nobody loves it ; nobody sees it . Who cares about the looks of a castaway like me ! "
136600	136612	136613	136613	she	198	" The people are gone to afternoon service , I suppose ? "
136616	136622	136624	136626	the old woman	1273	" No , my dear , "
136628	136699	136624	136626	the old woman	1273	" ' Tis too soon for that ; the bells hain't strook out yet . They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn . A ranter preaches there between the services - an excellent , fiery , Christian man , they say . But , Lord , I do n't go to hear'n ! What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I. "
136868	136901	136856	136856	she	198	" O foolish galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth , crucified among you ? "
138370	138373	138374	138374	he	4566	" Tess ! "
138384	138387	138388	138388	he	4566	" Tess ! "
138391	138399	138388	138388	he	4566	" It is I - Alec d'Urberville . "
138412	138418	138419	138419	she	198	" I see it is , "
138423	138439	138440	138440	he	4566	" Well - is that all ? Yet I deserve no more ! Of course , "
138448	138495	138440	138440	he	4566	" there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this . But - I must put up with that . ... I heard you had gone away ; nobody knew where . Tess , you wonder why I have followed you ? "
138496	138515	138536	138536	she	198	" I do , rather ; and I would that you had not , with all my heart ! "
138516	138525	138526	138526	he	4566	" Yes - you may well say it , "
138541	138674	138536	138536	she	198	" But do n't mistake me ; I beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticing - if you did notice it - how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there . It was but a momentary faltering ; and considering what you have been to me , it was natural enough . But will helped me through it - though perhaps you think me a humbug for saying it - and immediately afterwards I felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to come - sneer if you like - the woman whom I had so grievously wronged was that person . I have come with that sole purpose in view - nothing more . "
138688	138702	138683	138683	her	4568	" Have you saved yourself ? Charity begins at home , they say . "
138703	138709	138711	138711	he	4569	" I have done nothing ! "
138714	138970	138711	138711	he	4569	" Heaven , as I have been telling my hearers , has done all . No amount of contempt that you can pour upon me , Tess , will equal what I have poured upon myself - the old Adam of my former years ! Well , it is a strange story ; believe it or not ; but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about , and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen . Have you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster - you must have done do ? - old Mr Clare ; one of the most earnest of his school ; one of the few intense men left in the Church ; not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot , but quite an exception among the Established clergy , the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries , till they are but the shadow of what they were . I only differ from him on the question of Church and State - the interpretation of the text , ' Come out from among them and be ye separate , saith the Lord ' - that 's all . He is one who , I firmly believe , has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name . You have heard of him ? "
138971	138975	138976	138976	she	4570	" I have , "
138979	139222	139414	139414	She	4573	" He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society ; and I , wretched fellow that I was , insulted him when , in his disinterestedness , he tried to reason with me and show me the way . He did not resent my conduct , he simply said that some day I should receive the first - fruits of the Spirit - that those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray . There was a strange magic in his words . They sank into my mind . But the loss of my mother hit me most ; and by degrees I was brought to see daylight . Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others , and that is what I was trying to do to - day ; though it is only lately that I have preached hereabout . The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North of England among strangers , where I preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts , so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of one 's sincerity , addressing those who have known one , and have been one 's companions in the days of darkness . If you could only know , Tess , the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself , I am sure - "
139223	139231	139232	139232	she	4571	" Do n't go on with it ! "
139255	139362	139251	139251	she	4571	" I ca n't believe in such sudden things ! I feel indignant with you for talking to me like this , when you know - when you know what harm you 've done me ! You , and those like you , take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow ; and then it is a fine thing , when you have had enough of that , to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted ! Out upon such - I do n't believe in you - I hate it ! "
139363	139366	139367	139367	he	4573	" Tess , "
139370	139399	139367	139367	he	4573	" do n't speak so ! It came to me like a jolly new idea ! And you do n't believe me ? What do n't you believe ? "
139400	139409	139251	139251	she	4571	" Your conversion . Your scheme of religion . "
139410	139413	139367	139367	he	4573	" Why ? "
139419	139432	139414	139414	She	4573	" Because a better man than you does not believe in such . "
139433	139446	139251	139251	she	4571	" What a woman 's reason ! Who is this better man ? "
139447	139454	139414	139414	She	4573	" I can not tell you . "
139455	139458	139459	139459	he	4573	" Well , "
139478	139516	139459	139459	he	4573	" God forbid that I should say I am a good man - and you know I do n't say any such thing . I am new to goodness , truly ; but newcomers see furthest sometimes . "
139517	139520	139521	139521	she	4573	" Yes , "
139525	139553	139521	139521	she	4573	" But I can not believe in your conversion to a new spirit . Such flashes as you feel , Alec , I fear do n't last ! "
139610	139619	139620	139620	he	4573	" Do n't look at me like that ! "
139652	139658	139644	139644	her	198	" I beg your pardon ! "
139694	139725	139644	139644	her	198	" No , no ! Do n't beg my pardon . But since you wear a veil to hide your good looks , why do n't you keep it down ? "
139735	139745	139726	139726	She	198	" It was mostly to keep off the wind . "
139746	139758	139759	139759	he	4573	" It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this , "
139763	139783	139759	139759	he	4573	" but it is better that I should not look too often on you . It might be dangerous . "
139784	139787	139789	139789	Tess	198	" Ssh ! "
139791	139836	139759	139759	he	4573	" Well , women 's faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them ! An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they ; and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget ! "
139967	139974	139917	139917	He	4573	" Cross - in - Hand . "
140164	140173	140174	140174	he	4573	" I think I must leave you now , "
140185	140256	140174	140174	he	4573	" I have to preach at Abbot's - Cernel at six this evening , and my way lies across to the right from here . And you upset me somewhat too , Tessy - I can not , will not , say why . I must go away and get strength . ... How is it that you speak so fluently now ? Who has taught you such good English ? "
140257	140266	140267	140267	she	4573	" I have learnt things in my troubles , "
140271	140278	140174	140174	he	4573	" What troubles have you had ? "
140300	140309	140310	140310	he	4573	" I knew nothing of this till now ! "
140314	140330	140310	140310	he	4573	" Why did n't you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on ? "
140344	140353	140337	140337	he	4573	" Well - you will see me again . "
140354	140357	140358	140358	she	4573	" No , "
140361	140369	140337	140337	he	4573	" Do not again come near me ! "
140370	140382	140383	140383	He	4573	" I will think . But before we part come here . "
140390	140451	140383	140383	He	4573	" This was once a Holy Cross . Relics are not in my creed ; but I fear you at moments - far more than you need fear me at present ; and to lessen my fear , put your hand upon that stone hand , and swear that you will never tempt me - by your charms or ways . "
140452	140473	140337	140337	he	4573	" Good God - how can you ask what is so unnecessary ! All that is furthest from my thought ! "
140474	140481	140383	140383	He	4573	" Yes - but swear it . "
140502	140512	140513	140513	he	4573	" I am sorry you are not a believer , "
140516	140564	140513	140513	he	4573	" that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind . But no more now . At home at least I can pray for you ; and I will ; and who knows what may not happen ? I 'm off . Goodbye ! "
140907	140920	140921	140921	she	198	" What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed ? "
140926	140934	140921	140921	she	198	" Was it ever a Holy Cross ? "
140935	141006	141020	141022	the solitary man	4604	" Cross - no ; ' twer not a cross ! ' Tis a thing of ill - omen , Miss. It was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung . The bones lie underneath . They say he sold his soul to the devil , and that he walks at times . "
141230	141248	141249	141249	she	312	" He is Amby Seedling , the chap who used to sometimes come and help at Talbothays , "
141253	141292	141249	141249	she	312	" He actually inquired and found out that I had come here , and has followed me . He says he 's been in love wi ' me these two years . But I 've hardly answered him . "
141370	141372	141418	141419	A man	1337	" grave "
141784	141794	141777	141777	D'Urberville	230	" I want to speak to you , Tess . "
141795	141809	141811	141811	she	198	" You have refused my last request , not to come near me ! "
141813	141823	141777	141777	D'Urberville	230	" Yes , but I have a good reason . "
141824	141830	141777	141777	D'Urberville	230	" Well , tell it . "
141831	141841	141777	141777	D'Urberville	230	" It is more serious than you may think . "
141902	141907	141908	141908	he	230	" It is this , "
141915	141988	141908	141908	he	230	" In thinking of your soul and mine when we last met , I neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition . You were well dressed , and I did not think of it . But I see now that it is hard - harder than it used to be when I - knew you - harder than you deserve . Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me ! "
142039	142042	142043	142043	he	230	" Tess , "
142053	142180	142043	142043	he	230	" yours was the very worst case I ever was concerned in ! I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me . Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life ! The whole blame was mine - the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge . You , too , the real blood of which I am but the base imitation , what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities ! I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them , whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference . "
142213	142224	142354	142354	He	4636	" But it is not that I came to say , "
142229	142353	142354	142354	He	4636	" My circumstances are these . I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge , and the place is my own . But I intend to sell it , and devote myself to missionary work in Africa . A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade , no doubt . However , what I want to ask you is , will you put it in my power to do my duty - to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you : that is , will you be my wife , and go with me ? ... I have already obtained this precious document . It was my old mother 's dying wish . "
142371	142376	142378	142378	she	4637	" What is it ? "
142380	142385	142354	142354	He	4636	" A marriage licence . "
142386	142394	142395	142395	she	4637	" O no , sir - no ! "
142402	142411	142414	142414	he	4636	" You will not ? Why is that ? "
142461	142464	142465	142465	he	4636	" Surely , "
142574	142592	142593	142593	he	4636	" You will not marry me , Tess , and make me a self - respecting man ? "
142605	142610	142593	142593	he	4636	" I can not . "
142611	142615	142555	142555	she	4637	" But why ? "
142616	142626	142593	142593	he	4636	" You know I have no affection for you . "
142627	142649	142555	142555	she	4637	" But you would get to feel that in time , perhaps - as soon as you really could forgive me ? "
142650	142653	142593	142593	he	4636	" Never ! "
142654	142659	142555	142555	she	4637	" Why so positive ? "
142660	142666	142593	142593	he	4636	" I love somebody else . "
142674	142678	142679	142679	he	4636	" You do ? "
142682	142703	142679	142679	he	4636	" Somebody else ? But has not a sense of what is morally right and proper any weight with you ? "
142704	142716	142555	142555	she	4637	" No , no , no - do n't say that ! "
142717	142739	142679	142679	he	4636	" Anyhow , then , your love for this other man may be only a passing feeling which you will overcome - "
142740	142745	142555	142555	she	4637	" No - no . "
142746	142754	142679	142679	he	4636	" Yes , yes ! Why not ? "
142755	142762	142555	142555	she	4637	" I can not tell you . "
142763	142769	142679	142679	he	4636	" You must in honour ! "
142770	142779	142555	142555	she	4637	" Well then ... I have married him . "
142780	142783	142784	142784	he	4636	" Ah ! "
142796	142810	142811	142811	she	4636	" I did not wish to tell - I did not mean to ! "
142814	142851	142811	142811	she	4636	" It is a secret here , or at any rate but dimly known . So will you , PLEASE will you , keep from questioning me ? You must remember that we are now strangers . "
142852	142860	142897	142902	the labourer who turned the machine	4645	" Strangers - are we ? Strangers ! "
142881	142888	142889	142889	he	4636	" Is that man your husband ? "
142904	142908	142909	142909	she	4636	" That man ! "
142913	142919	142909	142909	she	4636	" I should think not ! "
142920	142925	142944	142944	her	4636	" Who , then ? "
142926	142938	142939	142939	she	4636	" Do not ask what I do not wish to tell ! "
142962	142971	142972	142972	he	4636	" But I only asked for your sake ! "
142976	143128	142972	142972	he	4636	" Angels of heaven ! - God forgive me for such an expression - I came here , I swear , as I thought for your good . Tess - do n't look at me so - I can not stand your looks ! There never were such eyes , surely , before Christianity or since ! There - I wo n't lose my head ; I dare not . I own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you , which , I believed , was extinguished with all such feelings . But I thought that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both . ' The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband , ' I said to myself . But my plan is dashed from me ; and I must bear the disappointment ! "
143139	143151	143152	143152	he	4646	" Married . Married ! ... Well , that being so , "
143171	143245	143152	143152	he	4646	" that being prevented , I should like to do some good to you and your husband , whoever he may be . There are many questions that I am tempted to ask , but I will not do so , of course , in opposition to your wishes . Though , if I could know your husband , I might more easily benefit him and you . Is he on this farm ? "
143246	143249	143250	143250	she	4647	" No , "
143253	143259	143250	143250	she	4647	" He is far away . "
143260	143275	143152	143152	he	4646	" Far away ? From YOU ? What sort of husband can he be ? "
143276	143294	143250	143250	she	4647	" O , do not speak against him ! It was through you ! He found out - "
143295	143309	143152	143152	he	4646	" Ah , is it so ! ... That 's sad , Tess ! "
143310	143313	143250	143250	she	4647	" Yes . "
143314	143330	143152	143152	he	4646	" But to stay away from you - to leave you to work like this ! "
143331	143340	143341	143341	she	4647	" He does not leave me to work ! "
143357	143371	143341	143341	she	4647	" He do n't know it ! It is by my own arrangement . "
143372	143379	143152	143152	he	4646	" Then , does he write ? "
143380	143398	143341	143341	she	4647	" I - I can not tell you . There are things which are private to ourselves . "
143399	143419	143152	143152	he	4646	" Of course that means that he does not . You are a deserted wife , my fair Tess - "
143459	143468	143469	143469	she	4647	" You must not - you must not ! "
143491	143518	143469	143469	she	4647	" O , will you go away - for the sake of me and my husband - go , in the name of your own Christianity ! "
143519	143527	143528	143528	he	4649	" Yes , yes ; I will , "
143552	143570	143549	143549	he	4649	" Tess , as God is my judge , I meant no humbug in taking your hand ! "
143603	143621	143660	143660	d'Urberville	230	" What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o ' day ? "
143649	143658	143662	143662	his	406	" Do n't speak like that to her ! "
143672	143688	143662	143662	his	406	" Indeed , Mister ! And what mid Methodist pa'sons have to do with she ? "
143689	143695	143660	143660	d'Urberville	230	" Who is the fellow ? "
143710	143718	143719	143719	she	198	" Go - I do beg you ! "
143722	143744	143660	143660	d'Urberville	230	" What ! And leave you to that tyrant ? I can see in his face what a churl he is . "
143745	143768	143790	143791	Her defender	4654	" He wo n't hurt me . HE 'S not in love with me . I can leave at Lady - Day . "
143769	143789	143660	143660	d'Urberville	230	" Well , I have no right but to obey , I suppose . But - well , goodbye ! "
143902	143928	143929	143929	he	1947	" If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady - Day , I 'll see that you carry it out , "
143932	143961	143929	143929	he	1947	" ' Od rot the women - now ' tis one thing , and then ' tis another . But I 'll put up with it no longer ! "
144052	144058	144059	144059	she	198	" But no , no ! "
144063	144079	144059	144059	she	198	" I could not have married him now ! He is so unpleasant to me . "
144529	144538	144539	144539	he	230	" Tess - I could n't help it ! "
144559	144638	144544	144544	he	230	" I felt that I must call at least to ask how you are . I assure you I had not been thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday ; now I can not get rid of your image , try how I may ! It is hard that a good woman should do harm to a bad man ; yet so it is . If you would only pray for me , Tess ! "
144657	144665	144666	144666	she	198	" How can I pray for you , "
144669	144692	144666	144666	she	198	" when I am forbidden to believe that the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my account ? "
144693	144699	144803	144803	D'Urberville	230	" You really think that ? "
144700	144714	144666	144666	she	198	" Yes . I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise . "
144715	144721	144803	144803	D'Urberville	230	" Cured ? By whom ? "
144722	144732	144666	144666	she	198	" By my husband , if I must tell . "
144733	144770	144771	144771	he	4682	" Ah - your husband - your husband ! How strange it seems ! I remember you hinted something of the sort the other day . What do you really believe in these matters , Tess ? "
144774	144787	144771	144771	he	4682	" You seem to have no religion - perhaps owing to me . "
144788	144802	144666	144666	she	198	" But I have . Though I do n't believe in anything supernatural . "
144810	144824	144666	144666	she	198	" Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong ? "
144825	144832	144666	144666	she	198	" A good deal of it . "
144833	144846	144847	144847	he	4682	" H'm - and yet I 've felt so sure about it , "
144851	144877	144666	144666	she	198	" I believe in the SPIRIT of the Sermon on the Mount , and so did my dear husband ... But I do n't believe - "
144884	144889	144891	144891	d'Urberville	230	" The fact is , "
144894	144935	144891	144891	d'Urberville	230	" whatever your dear husband believed you accept , and whatever he rejected you reject , without the least inquiry or reasoning on your own part . That 's just like you women . Your mind is enslaved to his . "
144936	144944	144946	144946	she	4683	" Ah , because he knew everything ! "
144972	145001	144891	144891	d'Urberville	230	" Yes , but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another person like that . A pretty fellow he must be to teach you such scepticism ! "
145002	145060	145075	145075	She	4683	" He never forced my judgement ! He would never argue on the subject with me ! But I looked at it in this way ; what he believed , after inquiring deep into doctrines , was much more likely to be right than what I might believe , who had n't looked into doctrines at all . "
145061	145074	145075	145075	She	4683	" What used he to say ? He must have said something ? "
145149	145154	145137	145137	she	4683	" Say that again , "
145180	145184	145185	145185	he	230	" Anything else ? "
145189	145198	145201	145201	she	4683	" He said at another time something like this "
145228	145239	145201	145201	she	4683	" Ah - ha ! How do you remember them ? "
145240	145289	145201	145201	she	4683	" I wanted to believe what he believed , though he did n't wish me to ; and I managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts . I ca n't say I quite understand that one ; but I know it is right . "
145290	145307	145201	145201	she	4683	" H'm . Fancy your being able to teach me what you do n't know yourself ! "
145313	145325	145326	145326	she	4687	" And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his , "
145329	145351	145326	145326	she	4687	" I did n't wish it to be different . What 's good enough for him is good enough for me . "
145352	145366	145201	145201	she	4683	" Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he ? "
145367	145381	145326	145326	she	4687	" No - I never told him - if I am an infidel . "
145382	145463	145201	145201	she	4683	" Well - you are better off to - day that I am , Tess , after all ! You do n't believe that you ought to preach my doctrine , and , therefore , do no despite to your conscience in abstaining . I do believe I ought to preach it , but , like the devils , I believe and tremble , for I suddenly leave off preaching it , and give way to my passion for you . "
145464	145467	145326	145326	she	4687	" How ? "
145468	145471	145472	145472	he	4688	" Why , "
145476	145537	145472	145472	he	4688	" I have come all the way here to see you to - day ! But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair , where I have undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half - past two this afternoon , and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute . Here 's the announcement . "
145573	145581	145583	145583	Tess	198	" But how can you get there ? "
145590	145602	145326	145326	she	4687	" I can not get there ! I have come here . "
145603	145615	145326	145326	she	4687	" What , you have really arranged to preach , and - "
145616	145760	145326	145326	she	4687	" I have arranged to preach , and I shall not be there - by reason of my burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised ! - No , by my word and truth , I never despised you ; if I had I should not love you now ! Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of all ; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you saw the situation ; you did not remain at my pleasure ; so there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt , and you are she . But you may well despise me now ! I thought I worshipped on the mountains , but I find I still serve in the groves ! Ha ! ha ! "
145761	145776	145326	145326	she	4687	" O Alec d'Urberville ! what does this mean ? What have I done ! "
145777	145780	145781	145781	he	4689	" Done ? "
145792	145863	145864	145864	He	4689	" Nothing intentionally . But you have been the means - the innocent means - of my backsliding , as they call it . I ask myself , am I , indeed , one of those ' servants of corruption ' who , ' after they have escaped the pollutions of the world , are again entangled therein and overcome ' - whose latter end is worse than their beginning ? "
145872	145896	145897	145897	he	4689	" Tess , my girl , I was on the way to , at least , social salvation till I saw you again ! "
145910	145949	145897	145897	he	4689	" And why then have you tempted me ? I was firm as a man could be till I saw those eyes and that mouth again - surely there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve 's ! "
145965	145991	145950	145950	His	4689	" You temptress , Tess ; you dear damned witch of Babylon - I could not resist you as soon as I met you again ! "
145992	146002	146004	146004	Tess	198	" I could n't help your seeing me again ! "
146008	146073	145950	145950	His	4689	" I know it - I repeat that I do not blame you . But the fact remains . When I saw you ill - used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to think that I had no legal right to protect you - that I could not have it ; whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly ! "
146074	146085	146086	146086	she	198	" Do n't speak against him - he is absent ! "
146092	146120	146086	146086	she	198	" Treat him honourably - he has never wronged you ! O leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name ! "
146121	146128	146129	146129	he	4692	" I will - I will , "
146141	146203	146129	146129	he	4692	" I have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at the fair - it is the first time I have played such a practical joke . A month ago I should have been horrified at such a possibility . I 'll go away - to swear - and - ah , can I ! to keep away . "
146208	146221	146129	146129	he	4692	" One clasp , Tessy - one ! Only for old friendship - "
146222	146245	146129	146129	he	4692	" I am without defence . Alec ! A good man 's honour is in my keeping - think - be ashamed ! "
146246	146255	146129	146129	he	4692	" Pooh ! Well , yes - yes ! "
146473	146497	146450	146450	He	4692	" That clever fellow little thought that , by telling her those things , he might be paving my way back to her ! "
146608	146610	146605	146605	They	4699	" unhaling "
147179	147183	147175	147175	he	4707	" an engineer . "
147218	147220	147216	147216	him	406	" he "
147842	147847	147849	147850	Izz Huett	312	" Who is that ? "
147872	147882	147884	147884	Marian	310	" Somebody 's fancy - man , I s'pose , "
147887	147898	147854	147854	She	310	" I 'll lay a guinea he 's after Tess . "
147899	147922	147854	147854	She	310	" O no . ' Tis a ranter pa'son who 's been sniffing after her lately ; not a dandy like this . "
147923	147932	147854	147854	She	310	" Well - this is the same man . "
147933	147947	147854	147854	She	310	" The same man as the preacher ? But he 's quite different ! "
147948	147977	147854	147854	She	310	" He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher , and hev cut off his whiskers ; but he 's the same man for all that . "
147978	147990	147992	147992	Marian	310	" D'ye really think so ? Then I 'll tell her , "
147994	148009	147854	147854	She	310	" Do n't . She 'll see him soon enough , good - now . "
148010	148051	147854	147854	She	310	" Well , I do n't think it at all right for him to join his preaching to courting a married woman , even though her husband mid be abroad , and she , in a sense , a widow . "
148052	148062	148064	148064	Izz	312	" Oh - he can do her no harm , "
148067	148130	148064	148064	Izz	312	" Her mind can no more be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from the hole he 's in . Lord love ' ee , neither court - paying , nor preaching , nor the seven thunders themselves , can wean a woman when ' twould be better for her that she should be weaned . "
148164	148183	148185	148185	Marian	310	" You ought to het a quart o ' drink into ' ee , as I 've done , "
148187	148212	148185	148185	Marian	310	" You would n't look so white then . Why , souls above us , your face is as if you 'd been hagrode ! "
148280	148283	148267	148268	the gentleman	1007	" Oh ! "
148293	148306	148288	148288	she	198	" I shall eat my dinner here - right on the rick . "
148545	148555	148731	148731	She	4765	" I am here again , as you see , "
148559	148567	148568	148568	she	198	" Why do you trouble me so ! "
148580	148597	148731	148731	She	4765	" I trouble YOU ? I think I may ask , why do you trouble me ? "
148598	148610	148731	148731	She	4765	" Sure , I do n't trouble you any - when ! "
148611	148730	148731	148731	She	4765	" You say you do n't ? But you do ! You haunt me . Those very eyes that you turned upon my with such a bitter flash a moment ago , they come to me just as you showed them then , in the night and in the day ! Tess , ever since you told me of that child of ours , it is just as if my feelings , which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream , had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you , and had all at once gushed through . The religious channel is left dry forthwith ; and it is you who have done it ! "
148736	148747	148748	148748	she	4765	" What - you have given up your preaching entirely ? "
148785	149035	149036	149036	He	4767	" Entirely . I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was to address the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair . The deuce only knows what I am thought of by the brethren . Ah - ha ! The brethren ! No doubt they pray for me - weep for me ; for they are kind people in their way . But what do I care ? How could I go on with the thing when I had lost my faith in it ? - it would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind ! Among them I should have stood like Hymenaeus and Alexander , who were delivered over to Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme . What a grand revenge you have taken ! I saw you innocent , and I deceived you . Four years after , you find me a Christian enthusiast ; you then work upon me , perhaps to my complete perdition ! But Tess , my coz , as I used to call you , this is only my way of talking , and you must not look so horribly concerned . Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and shapely figure . I saw it on the rick before you saw me - that tight pinafore - thing sets it off , and that wing - bonnet - you field - girls should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger . "
149053	149093	149036	149036	He	4767	" I believe that if the bachelor - apostle , whose deputy I thought I was , had been tempted by such a pretty face , he would have let go the plough for her sake as I do ! "
149115	149141	149112	149112	he	4767	" Well , this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other , after all . But to speak seriously , Tess . "
149160	149283	149112	149112	he	4767	" Since I last saw you , I have been thinking of what you said that HE said . I have come to the conclusion that there does seem rather a want of common - sense in these threadbare old propositions ; how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare 's enthusiasm , and have gone so madly to work , transcending even him , I can not make out ! As for what you said last time , on the strength of your wonderful husband 's intelligence - whose name you have never told me - about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma , I do n't see my way to that at all . "
149284	149315	149142	149142	D'Urberville	230	" Why , you can have the religion of loving - kindness and purity at least , if you ca n't have - what do you call it - dogma . "
149316	149413	149112	149112	he	4767	" O no ! I 'm a different sort of fellow from that ! If there 's nobody to say , ' Do this , and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead ; do that , and if will be a bad thing for you , ' I ca n't warm up . Hang it , I am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if there 's nobody to be responsible to ; and if I were you , my dear , I would n't either ! "
149482	149488	149489	149489	he	4770	" Well , never mind , "
149492	149506	149489	149489	he	4770	" Here I am , my love , as in the old times ! "
149507	149520	149521	149521	she	4769	" Not as then - never as then - ' tis different ! "
149524	149557	149521	149521	she	4769	" And there was never warmth with me ! O why did n't you keep your faith , if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this ! "
149558	149648	149521	149521	she	4769	" Because you 've knocked it out of me ; so the evil be upon your sweet head ! Your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon him ! Ha - ha - I 'm awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the same ! Tess , I am more taken with you than ever , and I pity you too . For all your closeness , I see you are in a bad way - neglected by one who ought to cherish you . "
149700	149707	149708	149708	she	4773	" It is cruelty to me ! "
149711	149732	149708	149708	she	4773	" How - how can you treat me to this talk , if you care ever so little for me ? "
149733	149738	149739	149739	he	4776	" True , true , "
149746	149975	149739	149739	he	4776	" I did not come to reproach you for my deeds . I came Tess , to say that I do n't like you to be working like this , and I have come on purpose for you . You say you have a husband who is not I. Well , perhaps you have ; but I 've never seen him , and you 've not told me his name ; and altogether he seems rather a mythological personage . However , even if you have one , I think I am nearer to you than he is . I , at any rate , try to help you out of trouble , but he does not , bless his invisible face ! The words of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me . Do n't you know them , Tess ? - ' And she shall follow after her lover , but she shall not overtake him ; and she shall seek him , but shall not find him ; then shall she say , I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now ! ' ... Tess , my trap is waiting just under the hill , and - darling mine , not his ! - you know the rest . "
149996	150006	150007	150007	he	4778	" You have been the cause of my backsliding , "
150017	150036	150007	150007	he	4778	" you should be willing to share it , and leave that mule you call husband for ever . "
150184	150190	150191	150191	she	4777	" Now , punish me ! "
150216	150250	150191	150191	she	4777	" Whip me , crush me ; you need not mind those people under the rick ! I shall not cry out . Once victim , always victim - that 's the law ! "
150251	150259	150260	150260	he	4778	" O no , no , Tess , "
150264	150317	150260	150260	he	4778	" I can make full allowance for this . Yet you most unjustly forget one thing , that I would have married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so . Did I not ask you flatly to be my wife - hey ? Answer me . "
150318	150322	150362	150362	he	4778	" You did . "
150323	150335	150336	150336	His	4778	" And you can not be . But remember one thing ! "

151706	151722	151723	151723	he	4816	" I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or do , "
151735	151833	151723	151723	he	4816	" How the little limbs tremble ! You are as weak as a bled calf , you know you are ; and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived . How could you be so obstinate ? However , I have told the farmer that he has no right to employ women at steam - threshing . It is not proper work for them ; and on all the better class of farms it has been given up , as he knows very well . I will walk with you as far as your home . "
151834	151838	151839	151839	she	4816	" O yes , "
151846	151922	151839	151839	she	4816	" Walk wi ' me if you will ! I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o ' my state . Perhaps - perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were . Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for ; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at . I can not sense your meaning sometimes . "
151923	152038	151723	151723	he	4816	" If I can not legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you . And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed . My religious mania , or whatever it was , is over . But I retain a little good nature ; I hope I do . Now , Tess , by all that 's tender and strong between man and woman , trust me ! I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety , both for yourself and your parents and sisters . I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me . "

158551	158592	158444	158444	D'Urberville	230	" ' Empress , the way is ready , and not long , Beyond a row of myrtles ... ... If thou accept My conduct , I can bring thee thither soon . ' ' Lead then , ' said Eve .
158593	158630	158444	158444	D'Urberville	230	" And so on . My dear Tess , I am only putting this to you as a thing that you might have supposed or said quite untruly , because you think so badly of me . "
158631	158681	158444	158444	D'Urberville	230	" I never said you were Satan , or thought it . I do n't think of you in that way at all . My thoughts of you are quite cold , except when you affront me . What , did you come digging here entirely because of me ? "
158682	158727	158444	158444	D'Urberville	230	" Entirely . To see you ; nothing more . The smockfrock , which I saw hanging for sale as I came along , was an afterthought , that I might n't be noticed . I come to protest against your working like this . "
158728	158741	158444	158444	D'Urberville	230	" But I like doing it - it is for my father . "

160774	160869	161050	161050	D'Urberville	230	" If you are a genuine d'Urberville I ought not to tell you either , I suppose . As for me , I 'm a sham one , so it does n't matter . It is rather dismal . It is that this sound of a non - existent coach can only be heard by one of d'Urberville blood , and it is held to be of ill - omen to the one who hears it . It has to do with a murder , committed by one of the family , centuries ago . "

One of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful woman , who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her off , and in the struggle he killed her - or she killed him - I forget which . Such is one version of the tale ... I see that your tubs and buckets are packed . Going away , are n't you ? "

160990	161033	160705	160705	she	198	" Father 's was the last life on the property , and when that dropped we had no further right to stay . Though we might , perhaps , have stayed as weekly tenants - if it had not been for me . "

161082	161096	161074	161074	he	230	" That 's why you are going , is it ? Turned out ? "
161097	161132	161050	161050	D'Urberville	230	" We are not turned out exactly ; but as they said we should have to go soon , it was best to go now everybody was moving , because there are better chances . "
161133	161140	161074	161074	he	230	" Where are you going to ? "
161141	161164	161050	161050	D'Urberville	230	" Kingsbere . We have taken rooms there . Mother is so foolish about father 's people that she will go there . "
161165	161265	161074	161074	he	230	" But your mother 's family are not fit for lodgings , and in a little hole of a town like that . Now why not come to my garden - house at Trantridge ? There are hardly any poultry now , since my mother 's death ; but there 's the house , as you know it , and the garden . It can be whitewashed in a day , and your mother can live there quite comfortably ; and I will put the children to a good school . Really I ought to do something for you ! "
161266	161277	161278	161278	she	5157	" But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere ! "
161281	161288	161278	161278	she	5157	" And we can wait there - "
161289	161395	161074	161074	he	230	" Wait - what for ? For that nice husband , no doubt . Now look here , Tess , I know what men are , and , bearing in mind the grounds of your separation , I am quite positive he will never make it up with you . Now , though I have been your enemy , I am your friend , even if you wo n't believe it . Come to this cottage of mine . We 'll get up a regular colony of fowls , and your mother can attend to them excellently ; and the children can go to school . "
161409	161441	161406	161406	she	198	" How do I know that you would do all this ? Your views may change - and then - we should be - my mother would be - homeless again . "
161442	161466	161406	161406	she	198	" O no - no . I would guarantee you against such as that in writing , if necessary . Think it over . "
161491	161498	161499	161499	he	5158	" Please just tell your mother , "
161506	161560	161499	161499	he	5158	" It is her business to judge - not yours . I shall get the house swept out and whitened to - morrow morning , and fires lit ; and it will be dry by the evening , so that you can come straight there . Now mind , I shall expect you . "
161582	161594	161595	161595	he	5158	" I owe you something for the past , you know , "
161598	161615	161595	161595	he	5158	" And you cured me , too , of that craze ; so I am glad - "
161616	161638	161580	161580	d'Urberville	230	" I would rather you had kept the craze , so that you had kept the practice which went with it ! "
161639	161679	161595	161595	he	5158	" I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little . To - morrow I shall expect to hear your mother 's goods unloading ... Give me your hand on it now - dear , beautiful Tess ! "
161733	161741	161742	161742	he	5158	" Damnation - you are very cruel ! "
161750	161780	161742	161742	he	5158	" No , no ! - I know you did n't do it on purpose . Well I shall expect you , or your mother and children at least . "
161781	161793	161794	161794	she	5159	" I shall not come - I have plenty of money ! "
161797	161800	161742	161742	he	5158	" Where ? "
161801	161817	161742	161742	he	5158	" At my father - in - law 's , if I ask for it . "
161818	161848	161742	161742	he	5158	" IF you ask for it . But you wo n't , Tess ; I know you ; you 'll never ask for it - you 'll starve first ! "

163831	163880	163828	163828	her	310	" Do you know that the gentleman who follows ' ee - you 'll guess who I mean - came to ask for ' ee at Flintcomb after you had gone ? We did n't tell'n where you was , knowing you would n't wish to see him . "
163881	163890	163891	163891	Tess	198	" Ah - but I did see him ! "
163894	163899	163891	163891	Tess	198	" He found me . "
163900	163910	163828	163828	her	310	" And do he know where you be going ? "
163911	163916	163891	163891	Tess	198	" I think so . "
163917	163922	163828	163828	her	310	" Husband come back ? "
163923	163926	163927	163927	She	198	" No . "
164229	164242	164243	164243	he	1337	" You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield , I reckon ? "
164264	164293	164261	164261	She	673	" Though widow of the late Sir John d'Urberville , poor nobleman , if I cared for my rights ; and returning to the domain of his forefathers . "
164294	164359	164360	164361	The man	1516	" Oh ? Well , I know nothing about that ; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield , I am sent to tell ' ee that the rooms you wanted be let . We did n't know that you was coming till we got your letter this morning - when ' twas too late . But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere . "
164386	164395	164396	164396	she	658	" What shall we do now , Tess ? "
164400	164418	164396	164396	she	658	" Here 's a welcome to your ancestors ' lands ! However , let 's try further . "
164514	164522	164524	164524	Joan	205	" Very well - unload it here , "
164527	164534	164524	164524	Joan	205	" I 'll get shelter somewhere . "
164775	164785	164792	164792	she	673	" Is n't your family vault your own freehold ? "
164803	164863	164792	164792	she	673	" Why , of course ' tis , and that 's where we will camp , girls , till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof ! Now , Tess and ' Liza and Abraham , you help me . We 'll make a nest for these children , and then we 'll have another look round . "
164993	165010	165011	165011	she	205	" If it comes to the worst we can sleep there too , for one night , "
165014	165053	165011	165011	she	205	" But let us try further on , and get something for the dears to eat ! O , Tess , what 's the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen , if it leaves us like this ! "
165097	165106	165107	165107	he	5293	" Ah - I 'm looking for you ! "
165115	165127	165107	165107	he	5293	" This is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot ! "
165133	165138	165139	165139	he	5293	" Where is Tess ? "
165551	165558	165559	165559	he	557	" I saw you come in , "
165563	165592	165559	165559	he	557	" and got up there not to interrupt your meditations . A family gathering , is it not , with these old fellows under us here ? Listen . "
165612	165623	165624	165624	he	557	" That shook them a bit , I 'll warrant ! "
165627	165680	165624	165624	he	557	" And you thought I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them . But no . The old order changeth . The little finger of the sham d'Urberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath ... Now command me . What shall I do ? "
165681	165685	165686	165686	she	198	" Go away ! "
165689	165700	165702	165702	he	557	" I will - I 'll look for your mother , "
165712	165722	165709	165709	he	557	" Mind this ; you 'll be civil yet ! "
165740	165752	165727	165727	she	198	" Why am I on the wrong side of this door ! "
165839	165851	165853	165853	Marian	310	" ' Tisn't as though she had never known him afore , "
165855	165940	165853	165853	Marian	310	" His having won her once makes all the difference in the world . ' Twould be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again . Mr Clare can never be anything to us , Izz ; and why should we grudge him to her , and not try to mend this quarrel ? If he could on'y know what straits she 's put to , and what 's hovering round , he might come to take care of his own . "
165941	165948	165853	165853	Marian	310	" Could we let him know ? "
166302	166308	166310	166311	the Vicar	1858	" Plenty of time yet , "
166313	166359	166310	166311	the Vicar	1858	" He does n't reach Chalk - Newton till six , even if the train should be punctual , and ten miles of country - road , five of them in Crimmercrock Lane , are not jogged over in a hurry by our old horse . "
166360	166375	166310	166311	the Vicar	1858	" But he has done it in an hour with us , my dear . "
166376	166380	166310	166311	the Vicar	1858	" Years ago . "
166538	166552	166554	166555	Mrs Clare	200	" O , my boy , my boy - home again at last ! "
166650	166668	166669	166669	she	200	" O , it is not Angel - not my son - the Angel who went away ! "
166803	166813	166814	166814	he	284	" I was ill over there , you know , "
166817	166824	166814	166814	he	284	" I am all right now . "
166876	166885	166886	166886	he	284	" Has any letter come for me lately ? "
166889	166917	166886	166886	he	284	" I received the last you sent on by the merest chance , and after considerable delay through being inland ; or I might have come sooner . "
166918	166928	166941	166941	They	5349	" It was from your wife , we supposed ? "
166929	166933	166886	166886	he	284	" It was . "
167065	167071	167073	167073	Angel	200	" It is quite true ! "
167080	167090	167073	167073	Angel	200	" Perhaps she will never be reconciled to me ! "
167091	167108	167110	167111	his mother	6090	" Do n't , Angel , be so anxious about a mere child of the soil ! "
167113	167196	167110	167111	his mother	6090	" Child of the soil ! Well , we all are children of the soil . I wish she were so in the sense you mean ; but let me now explain to you what I have never explained before , that her father is a descendant in the male line of one of the oldest Norman houses , like a good many others who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages , and are dubbed ' sons of the soil . ' "
167604	167611	167599	167599	His	5363	" which alters when it alteration finds "
167884	167890	167873	167873	you	5369	" I am coming soon , "
168208	168229	168185	168185	he	5377	" Honour'd Sir , Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you , "
168233	168240	168185	168185	he	5377	" From Two Well - Wishers . "
168572	168575	168586	168587	the farmer	1947	" Mrs Clare "
169249	169280	169232	169233	Some man	5434	" Ah , sir , now that 's a man who did n't want to lie here , but wished to be carried to Kingsbere , where his ancestors be . "
169281	169291	169236	169237	the sexton	1867	" And why did n't they respect his wish ? "
169292	169336	169232	169233	Some man	5434	" Oh - no money . Bless your soul , sir , why - there , I would n't wish to say it everywhere , but - even this headstone , for all the flourish wrote upon en , is not paid for . "
169337	169345	169236	169237	the sexton	1867	" Ah , who put it up ? "
169642	169651	169652	169652	he	5442	" I want to see her at once , "
169655	169672	169652	169652	he	5442	" You said you would write to me again , but you have not done so . "
169673	169680	169682	169682	Joan	205	" Because she've not come home , "
169684	169693	169652	169652	he	5442	" Do you know if she is well ? "
169694	169706	169708	169708	she	205	" I do n't . But you ought to , sir , "
169710	169720	169652	169652	he	5442	" I admit it . Where is she staying ? "
169743	169755	169756	169756	she	205	" I - do n't know exactly where she is staying , "
169759	169765	169756	169756	she	205	" She was - but - "
169766	169771	169785	169785	she	205	" Where was she ? "
169772	169781	169756	169756	she	205	" Well , she is not there now . "
169815	169827	169811	169812	the youngest	609	" Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess ? "
169828	169834	169835	169835	Joan	205	" He has married her , "
169838	169842	169835	169835	Joan	205	" Go inside . "
169853	169873	169843	169843	Clare	200	" Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her ? If not , of course - "
169874	169882	169835	169835	Joan	205	" I do n't think she would . "
169883	169888	169843	169843	Clare	200	" Are you sure ? "
169889	169897	169835	169835	Joan	205	" I am sure she would n't . "
169913	169920	169921	169921	he	5459	" I am sure she would ! "
169925	169934	169921	169921	he	5459	" I know her better than you do . "
169935	169951	169980	169980	her	673	" That 's very likely , sir ; for I have never really known her . "
169952	169970	169921	169921	he	5459	" Please tell me her address , Mrs Durbeyfield , in kindness to a lonely wretched man ! "
170000	170006	169990	169990	she	673	" She is at Sandbourne . "
170007	170023	169990	169990	she	673	" Ah - where there ? Sandbourne has become a large place , they say . "
170024	170046	169990	169990	she	673	" I do n't know more particularly than I have said - Sandbourne . For myself , I was never there . "
170065	170073	170074	170074	he	5459	" Are you in want of anything ? "
170078	170083	170084	170084	she	205	" No , sir , "
170087	170095	170084	170084	she	205	" We are fairly well provided for . "
170711	170722	170724	170724	Angel	200	" Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare ? "
170753	170759	170750	170750	Clare	200	" Of a Miss Durbeyfield ? "
170760	170763	170726	170727	The postman	5166	" Durbeyfield ? "
170773	170789	170790	170790	he	5459	" There 's visitors coming and going every day , as you know , sir , "
170793	170808	170790	170790	he	5459	" and without the name of the house ' tis impossible to find 'em . "
170826	170845	170847	170848	the second	589	" I know no name of Durbeyfield ; but there is the name of d'Urberville at The Herons , "
170850	170855	170857	170857	Clare	200	" That 's it ! "
170871	170878	170863	170863	she	200	" What place is The Herons ? "
170879	170898	170914	170915	the milkman	5499	" A stylish lodging - house . ' Tis all lodging - houses here , bless ' ee . "
171020	171024	171007	171007	herself	763	" Mrs d'Urberville ? "
171025	171028	171007	171007	herself	763	" Yes . "
171053	171068	171007	171007	herself	763	" Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her ? "
171069	171083	171007	171007	herself	763	" It is rather early . What name shall I give , sir ? "
171084	171087	171007	171007	herself	763	" Angel . "
171088	171092	171007	171007	herself	763	" Mr Angel ? "
171093	171108	171007	171007	herself	763	" No ; Angel . It is my Christian name . She 'll understand . "
171109	171118	171007	171007	herself	763	" I 'll see if she is awake . "
171219	171236	171237	171237	he	5499	" Dear me ! what will she think of me , so altered as I am ! "
171419	171422	171423	171423	he	5499	" Tess ! "
171427	171454	171423	171423	he	5499	" can you forgive me for going away ? Ca n't you - come to me ? How do you get to be - like this ? "
171455	171461	171463	171463	she	198	" It is too late , "
171478	171496	171497	171497	he	5499	" I did not think rightly of you - I did not see you as you were ! "
171502	171513	171497	171497	he	5499	" I have learnt to since , dearest Tessy mine ! "
171514	171521	171522	171522	she	198	" Too late , too late ! "
171544	171563	171522	171522	she	198	" Do n't come close to me , Angel ! No - you must not . Keep away . "
171564	171609	171526	171526	her	198	" But do n't you love me , my dear wife , because I have been so pulled down by illness ? You are not so fickle - I am come on purpose for you - my mother and father will welcome you now ! "
171610	171630	171522	171522	she	198	" Yes - O , yes , yes ! But I say , I say it is too late . "
171652	171677	171631	171631	She	198	" Do n't you know all - do n't you know it ? Yet how do you come here if you do not know ? "
171678	171691	171526	171526	her	198	" I inquired here and there , and I found the way . "
171692	171700	171701	171701	she	198	" I waited and waited for you , "
171714	171775	171701	171701	she	198	" But you did not come ! And I wrote to you , and you did not come ! He kept on saying you would never come any more , and that I was a foolish woman . He was very kind to me , and to mother , and to all of us after father 's death . He - "
171776	171782	171835	171835	She	198	" I do n't understand . "
171783	171792	171701	171701	she	198	" He has won me back to him . "
171838	171905	171835	171835	She	198	" He is upstairs . I hate him now , because he told me a lie - that you would not come again ; and you HAVE come ! These clothes are what he 's put upon me : I did n't care what he did wi ' me ! But - will you go away , Angel , please , and never come any more ? "
171936	171944	171946	171946	Clare	200	" Ah - it is my fault ! "
172450	172457	172442	172448	a soul bound to some Ixionian wheel	5550	" O - O - O ! "
172470	172477	172478	172479	The landlady	763	" O - O - O ! "
172615	172621	172606	172607	a man	1337	" What 's the matter ? "
172659	172822	172833	172833	she	5556	" And then my dear , dear husband came home to me ... and I did not know it ! ... And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you did not stop using it - no - you did not stop ! My little sisters and brothers and my mother 's needs - they were the things you moved me by ... and you said my husband would never come back - never ; and you taunted me , and said what a simpleton I was to expect him ! ... And at last I believed you and gave way ! ... And then he came back ! Now he is gone . Gone a second time , and I have lost him now for ever ... and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any more - only hate me ! ... O yes , I have lost him now - again because of - you ! "
172886	172964	172883	172883	She	5556	" And he is dying - he looks as if he is dying ! ... And my sin will kill him and not kill me ! ... O , you have torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in pity not to make me be again ! ... My own true husband will never , never - O God - I ca n't bear this ! - I can not ! "
173725	173758	173704	173704	He	1516	" My good God , the gentleman in bed is dead ! I think he has been hurt with a knife - a lot of blood had run down upon the floor ! "
174297	174324	174292	174292	her	1028	" I saw you - turn away from the station - just before I got there - and I have been following you all this way ! "
174403	174406	174407	174407	she	1028	" Angel , "
174416	174438	174407	174407	she	1028	" do you know what I have been running after you for ? To tell you that I have killed him ! "
174450	174453	174455	174455	he	1516	" What ! "
174471	174483	174484	174484	she	1028	" I have done it - I do n't know how , "
174487	174743	174484	174484	she	1028	" Still , I owed it to you , and to myself , Angel . I feared long ago , when I struck him on the mouth with my glove , that I might do it some day for the trap he set for me in my simple youth , and his wrong to you through me . He has come between us and ruined us , and now he can never do it any more . I never loved him at all , Angel , as I loved you . You know it , do n't you ? You believe it ? You did n't come back to me , and I was obliged to go back to him . Why did you go away - why did you - when I loved you so ? I ca n't think why you did it . But I do n't blame you ; only , Angel , will you forgive me my sin against you , now I have killed him ? I thought as I ran along that you would be sure to forgive me now I have done that . It came to me as a shining light that I should get you back that way . I could not bear the loss of you any longer - you do n't know how entirely I was unable to bear your not loving me ! Say you do now , dear , dear husband ; say you do , now I have killed him ! "
174744	174763	174764	174764	he	5631	" I do love you , Tess - O , I do - it is all come back ! "
174776	174788	174764	174764	he	5631	" But how do you mean - you have killed him ? "
174789	174796	174797	174797	she	5632	" I mean that I have , "
174803	174812	174764	174764	he	5631	" What , bodily ? Is he dead ? "
174813	174870	174764	174764	he	5631	" Yes . He heard me crying about you , and he bitterly taunted me ; and called you by a foul name ; and then I did it . My heart could not bear it . He had nagged me about you before . And then I dressed myself and came away to find you . "
175147	175178	175130	175130	He	5633	" I will not desert you ! I will protect you by every means in my power , dearest love , whatever you may have done or not have done ! "
175410	175418	175399	175399	herself	198	" Are we going anywhere in particular ? "
175419	175429	175399	175399	herself	198	" I do n't know , dearest . Why ? "
175430	175436	175399	175399	herself	198	" I do n't know . "
175437	175473	175399	175399	herself	198	" Well , we might walk a few miles further , and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or other - in a lonely cottage , perhaps . Can you walk well , Tessy ? "
175474	175491	175399	175399	herself	198	" O yes ! I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me ! "
175737	175747	175749	175749	she	198	" I feel strong enough to walk any distance , "
175751	175792	175793	175793	Clare	200	" I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of the country , where we can hide for a time , and are less likely to be looked for than anywhere near the coast , "
175796	175813	175793	175793	Clare	200	" Later on , when they have forgotten us , we can make for some port . "
175906	175914	176031	176031	he	5662	" This desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished "
175949	175954	175956	175956	Clare	200	" I know it , "
175958	175981	175956	175956	Clare	200	" It is Bramshurst Court . You can see that it is shut up , and grass is growing on the drive . "
175982	175990	175992	175992	Tess	198	" Some of the windows are open , "
175994	176004	175956	175956	Clare	200	" Just to air the rooms , I suppose . "
176005	176020	175956	175956	Clare	200	" All these rooms empty , and we without a roof to our heads ! "
176021	176030	176031	176031	he	5662	" You are getting tired , my Tess ! "
176034	176040	176031	176031	he	5662	" We 'll stop soon . "
176125	176133	176134	176134	she	198	" Could we sleep under the trees ? "
176144	176156	176157	176157	he	5662	" I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed , "
176160	176169	176157	176157	he	5662	" Let us go back towards it again . "
176301	176319	176321	176321	he	5662	" Now , we can get in through one of the lower windows , and rest there , "
176504	176509	176511	176511	he	5662	" Rest at last ! "
176715	176725	176726	176726	he	5662	" Why did n't you tell me next day ? "
176729	176739	176726	176726	he	5662	" It might have prevented much misunderstanding and woe . "
176740	176749	176751	176751	she	674	" Do n't think of what 's past ! "
176753	176778	176751	176751	she	674	" I am not going to think outside of now . Why should we ! Who knows what to - morrow has in store ? "
177054	177069	177070	177070	she	674	" Why should we put an end to all that 's sweet and lovely ! "
177073	177080	177070	177070	she	674	" What must come will come . "
177090	177101	177070	177070	she	674	" All is trouble outside there ; inside here content . "
177126	177131	177132	177132	she	674	" And - and , "
177141	177203	177132	177132	she	674	" I fear that what you think of me now may not last . I do not wish to outlive your present feeling for me . I would rather not . I would rather be dead and buried when the time comes for you to despise me , so that it may never be known to me that you despised me . "
177204	177212	177102	177102	He	5662	" I can not ever despise you . "
177213	177283	177132	177132	she	674	" I also hope that . But considering what my life has been , I can not see why any man should , sooner or later , be able to help despising me .... How wickedly mad I was ! Yet formerly I never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm , and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me cry . "
177672	177681	177683	177683	he	5701	" I think we will leave at once , "
177685	177719	177683	177683	he	5701	" It is a fine day . And I can not help fancying somebody is about the house . At any rate , the woman will be sure to come to - day . "
177764	177772	177773	177773	she	198	" Ah , happy house - goodbye ! "
177776	177797	177773	177773	she	198	" My life can only be a question of a few weeks . Why should we not have stayed there ? "
177798	177872	177753	177753	she	198	" Do n't say it , Tess ! We shall soon get out of this district altogether . We 'll continue our course as we 've begun it , and keep straight north . Nobody will think of looking for us there . We shall be looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all . When we are in the north we will get to a port and away . "
178258	178265	178267	178267	Angel	200	" What monstrous place is this ? "
178269	178273	178275	178275	she	200	" It hums , "
178277	178280	178275	178275	she	200	" Hearken ! "
178449	178455	178443	178443	Angel	200	" What can it be ? "
178494	178502	178503	178503	he	5726	" A very Temple of the Winds , "
178571	178576	178578	178578	Clare	200	" It is Stonehenge ! "
178580	178588	178578	178578	Clare	200	" The heathen temple , you mean ? "
178589	178618	178578	178578	Clare	200	" Yes . Older than the centuries ; older than the d'Urbervilles ! Well , what shall we do , darling ? We may find shelter further on . "
178688	178700	178701	178701	she	198	" I do n't want to go any further , Angel , "
178711	178718	178701	178701	she	198	" Ca n't we bide here ? "
178719	178741	178781	178781	He	5739	" I fear not . This spot is visible for miles by day , although it does not seem so now . "
178742	178780	178701	178701	she	198	" One of my mother 's people was a shepherd hereabouts , now I think of it . And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen . So now I am at home . "
178796	178812	178781	178781	He	5739	" Sleepy are you , dear ? I think you are lying on an altar . "
178813	178822	178823	178823	she	198	" I like very much to be here , "
178826	178876	178823	178823	she	198	" It is so solemn and lonely - after my great happiness - with nothing but the sky above my face . It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two ; and I wish there were not - except ' Liza - Lu . "
178908	178929	178930	178930	she	198	" Angel , if anything happens to me , will you watch over ' Liza - Lu for my sake ? "
178947	178951	178894	178894	he	5739	" I will . "
178952	178989	178894	178894	he	5739	" She is so good and simple and pure . O , Angel - I wish you would marry her if you lose me , as you will do shortly . O , if you would ! "
178990	179009	178894	178894	he	5739	" If I lose you I lose all ! And she is my sister - in - law . "
179010	179125	178894	178894	he	5739	" That 's nothing , dearest . People marry sister - laws continually about Marlott ; and ' Liza - Lu is so gentle and sweet , and she is growing so beautiful . O , I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits ! If you would train her and teach her , Angel , and bring her up for your own self ! ... She had all the best of me without the bad of me ; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us ... Well , I have said it . I wo n't mention it again . "
179194	179202	179204	179204	she	5742	" Did they sacrifice to God here ? "
179206	179209	179211	179211	he	5743	" No , "
179213	179217	179330	179330	He	5744	" Who to ? "
179218	179247	179330	179330	He	5744	" I believe to the sun . That lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun , which will presently rise behind it . "
179248	179255	179256	179256	she	5742	" This reminds me , dear , "
179259	179329	179256	179256	she	5742	" You remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married ? But I knew your mind all the same , and I thought as you thought - not from any reasons of my own , but because you thought so . Tell me now , Angel , do you think we shall meet again after we are dead ? I want to know . "
179342	179353	179355	179355	she	5742	" O , Angel - I fear that means no ! "
179362	179395	179355	179355	she	5742	" And I wanted so to see you again - so much , so much ! What - not even you and I , Angel , who love each other so well ? "
179733	179741	179742	179742	he	5755	" It is no use , sir , "
179745	179762	179742	179742	he	5755	" There are sixteen of us on the Plain , and the whole country is reared . "
179763	179770	179771	179771	he	5744	" Let her finish her sleep ! "
179912	179919	179920	179920	she	200	" What is it , Angel ? "
179926	179933	179920	179920	she	200	" Have they come for me ? "
179934	179939	179940	179940	he	5744	" Yes , dearest , "
179943	179948	179940	179940	he	5744	" They have come . "
179949	179957	179958	179958	she	200	" It is as it should be , "
179961	180002	179958	179958	she	200	" Angel , I am almost glad - yes , glad ! This happiness could not have lasted . It was too much . I have had enough ; and now I shall not live for you to despise me ! "
180021	180026	180027	180027	she	200	" I am ready , "
180365	180368	180358	180358	their	5777	" Two Apostles "
180808	180810	180815	180819	the President of the Immortals	5814	" Justice "
