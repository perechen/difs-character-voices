808	811	832	834	that young man	227	" artists , "
1764	1770	1771	1771	he	91	" It may well be , "
1780	1846	1771	1771	he	91	" it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . "
1923	1932	1933	1933	he	94	" An artist is identical with an anarchist , "
1936	2035	1933	1933	he	94	" You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist . The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . "
2036	2041	2043	2044	Mr. Syme	92	" So it is , "
2046	2049	2051	2051	Gregory	94	" Nonsense ! "
2063	2176	2051	2051	Gregory	94	" Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! "
2177	2185	2187	2188	the poet	2164	" It is you who are unpoetical , "
2191	2362	2187	2188	the poet	2164	" If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it . We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo ! it is Victoria . No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride . Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say ! "
2363	2368	2370	2370	Gregory	94	" Must you go ? "
2373	2378	2381	2381	Syme	92	" I tell you , "
2385	2505	2381	2381	Syme	92	" that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria . I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word ' Victoria , ' it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed ' Victoria ' ; it is the victory of Adam . "
2520	2525	2526	2526	he	94	" And even then , "
2529	2592	2526	2526	he	94	" we poets always ask the question , ' And what is Victoria now that you have got there ? ' You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria . Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt . "
2593	2597	2599	2599	Syme	92	" There again , "
2602	2675	2599	2599	Syme	92	" what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea - sick . Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I 'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is - revolting . It 's mere vomiting . "
2696	2703	2704	2704	he	92	" It is things going right , "
2707	2763	2704	2704	he	92	" that is poetical ! Our digestions , for instance , going sacredly and silently right , that is the foundation of all poetry . Yes , the most poetical thing , more poetical than the flowers , more poetical than the stars - the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick . "
2764	2767	2769	2769	Gregory	94	" Really , "
2772	2778	2769	2769	Gregory	94	" the examples you choose - "
2779	2785	2787	2787	Syme	92	" I beg your pardon , "
2790	2799	2787	2787	Syme	92	" I forgot we had abolished all conventions . "
2813	2820	2821	2821	he	94	" You do n't expect me , "
2824	2832	2821	2821	he	94	" to revolutionise society on this lawn ? "
2843	2850	2851	2851	he	92	" No , I do n't , "
2854	2875	2851	2851	he	92	" but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do . "
2902	2910	2911	2911	he	94	" Do n't you think , then , "
2918	2927	2911	2911	he	94	" that I am serious about my anarchism ? "
2928	2934	2936	2936	Syme	92	" I beg your pardon ? "
2938	2947	2949	2949	Gregory	94	" Am I not serious about my anarchism ? "
2955	2960	2962	2962	Syme	92	" My dear fellow ! "
2986	2990	2991	2991	she	287	" Mr. Syme , "
2994	3019	2991	2991	she	287	" do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ? "
3023	3027	3028	3028	he	94	" Do you ? "
3031	3037	3039	3040	the girl	285	" What do you mean ? "
3046	3052	3054	3054	Syme	92	" My dear Miss Gregory , "
3057	3166	3054	3054	Syme	92	" there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity . When you say ' thank you ' for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say ' the world is round , ' do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you do n't mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean . It may be only a half - truth , quarter - truth , tenth - truth ; but then he says more than he means - from sheer force of meaning it . "
3218	3227	3228	3228	she	285	" Is he really an anarchist , then ? "
3231	3240	3242	3242	Syme	92	" Only in that sense I speak of , "
3244	3255	3242	3242	Syme	92	" or if you prefer it , in that nonsense . "
3266	3280	3256	3256	She	285	" He would n't really use - bombs or that sort of thing ? "
3300	3306	3307	3307	he	92	" Good Lord , no ! "
3310	3318	3307	3307	he	92	" that has to be done anonymously . "
3830	3837	3839	3839	Gregory	110	" I was waiting for you , "
3841	3850	3839	3839	Gregory	110	" Might I have a moment 's conversation ? "
3851	3857	3859	3859	Syme	92	" Certainly . About what ? "
3885	3891	3892	3892	he	305	" About this and this , "
3895	3939	3892	3892	he	305	" about order and anarchy . There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself - there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold . "
3940	3945	3947	3947	Syme	92	" All the same , "
3950	3982	3947	3947	Syme	92	" just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp . I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree . "
3990	4012	3987	3987	he	305	" But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ? "
4013	4016	4019	4019	Gregory	110	" No , "
4030	4048	4019	4019	Gregory	110	" I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever . "
4081	4085	4086	4086	he	305	" Mr. Syme , "
4089	4118	4086	4086	he	305	" this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable . You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before . "
4119	4122	4068	4068	Gregory	110	" Indeed ! "
4123	4128	4130	4130	Gregory	110	" Now I remember , "
4133	4160	4130	4130	Gregory	110	" one other person succeeded in doing it . The captain of a penny steamer if I remember correctly at Southend . You have irritated me . "
4161	4167	4169	4169	Syme	92	" I am very sorry , "
4173	4194	4196	4196	Gregory	110	" I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology , "
4200	4266	4196	4196	Gregory	110	" No duel could wipe it out . If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out . There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose . I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said . "
4267	4273	4130	4130	Gregory	110	" In what I said ? "
4274	4286	4196	4196	Gregory	110	" You said I was not serious about being an anarchist . "
4287	4294	4296	4296	Syme	92	" There are degrees of seriousness , "
4298	4336	4296	4296	Syme	92	" I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense , that you thought what you said well worth saying , that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth . "
4345	4352	4353	4353	he	92	" And in no other sense , "
4356	4391	4353	4353	he	92	" you think me serious ? You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths . You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious . "
4404	4407	4408	4408	he	92	" Serious ! "
4411	4491	4408	4408	he	92	" Good Lord ! is this street serious ? Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as well , but I should think very little of a man who did n't keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking - something more serious , whether it was religion or only drink . "
4492	4496	4498	4498	Gregory	110	" Very well , "
4504	4517	4498	4498	Gregory	110	" you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion . "
4534	4553	4408	4408	he	92	" You spoke just now of having a religion . Is it really true that you have one ? "
4554	4557	4559	4559	Syme	92	" Oh , "
4565	4572	4559	4559	Syme	92	" we are all Catholics now . "
4573	4662	4408	4408	he	92	" Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ? Will you swear that ! If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegation , if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return - "
4663	4671	4673	4673	Syme	92	" You will promise me in return ? "
4680	4690	4691	4691	Syme	92	" I will promise you a very entertaining evening . "
4698	4702	4703	4703	he	92	" Your offer , "
4706	4796	4703	4703	he	92	" is far too idiotic to be declined . You say that a poet is always an anarchist . I disagree ; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman . Permit me , here and now , to swear as a Christian , and promise as a good comrade and a fellow - artist , that I will not report anything of this , whatever it is , to the police . And now , in the name of Colney Hatch , what is it ? "
4797	4801	4803	4803	Gregory	110	" I think , "
4809	4817	4803	4803	Gregory	110	" that we will call a cab . "
4964	4972	4974	4974	Gregory	110	" Will you take a little supper ? "
4977	4995	4974	4974	Gregory	110	" The pate de foie gras is not good here , but I can recommend the game . "
5026	5035	5016	5016	he	92	" Oh , bring me some lobster mayonnaise . "
5045	5050	5041	5042	the man	324	" Certainly , sir ! "
5059	5065	5067	5067	Gregory	110	" What will you drink ? "
5077	5115	5067	5067	Gregory	110	" I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself ; I have dined . But the champagne can really be trusted . Do let me start you with a half - bottle of Pommery at least ? "
5116	5120	5122	5124	the motionless Syme	92	" Thank you ! "
5126	5132	5122	5124	the motionless Syme	92	" You are very good . "
5182	5192	5193	5193	he	92	" Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously ! "
5200	5236	5193	5193	he	92	" I do n't often have the luck to have a dream like this . It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster . It is commonly the other way . "
5237	5247	5249	5249	Gregory	110	" You are not asleep , I assure you , "
5251	5326	5249	5249	Gregory	110	" You are , on the contrary , close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence . Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth . "
5327	5333	5335	5335	Syme	92	" And who are we ? "
5342	5348	5350	5350	Gregory	110	" It is quite simple , "
5352	5366	5350	5350	Gregory	110	" We are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe . "
5367	5370	5372	5372	Syme	92	" Oh ! "
5375	5383	5372	5372	Syme	92	" You do yourselves well in drinks . "
5384	5393	5395	5395	Gregory	110	" Yes , we are serious about everything , "
5404	5442	5401	5401	he	325	" If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , do n't put it down to your inroads into the champagne . I do n't wish you to do yourself an injustice . "
5443	5456	5458	5458	Syme	92	" Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad , "
5463	5481	5458	5458	Syme	92	" but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition . May I smoke ? "
5482	5485	5487	5487	Gregory	110	" Certainly ! "
5495	5501	5487	5487	Gregory	110	" Try one of mine . "
5591	5598	5600	5600	Gregory	110	" You must not mind it , "
5602	5610	5600	5600	Gregory	110	" it 's a kind of screw . "
5611	5615	5617	5617	Syme	92	" Quite so , "
5620	5631	5617	5617	Syme	92	" a kind of screw . How simple that is ! "
5837	5842	5828	5828	he	92	" Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . "
5904	5916	5918	5918	Gregory	110	" I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities , "
5920	5929	5918	5918	Gregory	110	" we have to be very strict here . "
5930	5937	5939	5939	Syme	92	" Oh , do n't apologise , "
5941	5951	5953	5953	he	92	" I know your passion for law and order , "
6113	6122	6124	6124	Gregory	110	" And now , my dear Mr. Syme , "
6140	6271	6124	6124	Gregory	110	" now we are quite cosy , so let us talk properly . Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here . It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions , like jumping off a cliff or falling in love . Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still . I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg . That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession . Well , you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist . Does this place strike you as being serious ? "
6272	6285	6287	6287	Syme	92	" It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety , "
6289	6370	6287	6287	Syme	92	" but may I ask you two questions ? You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep . So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries . First of all , what is it really all about ? What is it you object to ? You want to abolish Government ? "
6371	6376	6378	6378	Gregory	110	" To abolish God ! "
6387	6481	6378	6378	Gregory	110	" We do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations ; that sort of anarchism does exist , but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists . We dig deeper and we blow you higher . We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue , honour and treachery , upon which mere rebels base themselves . The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man ! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs . We have abolished Right and Wrong . "
6482	6488	6490	6490	Syme	92	" And Right and Left , "
6496	6513	6490	6490	Syme	92	" I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me . "
6514	6522	6524	6524	Gregory	110	" You spoke of a second question , "
6526	6530	6532	6532	Syme	92	" With pleasure , "
6534	6662	6532	6532	Syme	92	" In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public - house . You have a heavy iron door . You can not pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain . You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike . May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ? "
6666	6672	6673	6673	he	338	" The answer is simple , "
6676	6713	6673	6673	he	338	" I told you I was a serious anarchist , and you did not believe me . Nor do they believe me . Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me . "
6729	6739	6740	6740	he	338	" The history of the thing might amuse you , "
6743	7032	6740	6740	he	338	" When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises . I dressed up as a bishop . I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets , in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey . I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind . I was misinformed . When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing - room I cried out in a voice of thunder , ' Down ! down ! presumptuous human reason ! ' they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all . I was nabbed at once . Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor . Then I tried being a major . Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence - the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out ' Blood ! ' abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , ' Let the weak perish ; it is the Law . ' Well , well , it seems majors do n't do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to the President of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe . "
7033	7039	7041	7041	Syme	92	" What is his name ? "
7043	7050	7052	7052	Gregory	110	" You would not know it , "
7054	7123	7052	7052	Gregory	110	" That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they were heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you can not be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have been children in his hands . "
7138	7332	7124	7124	He	339	" But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England . I said to him , ' What disguise will hide me from the world ? What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ? ' He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face . ' You want a safe disguise , do you ? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ? ' I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion 's voice . ' Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool ! ' he roared so that the room shook . ' Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then . ' And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and - by God ! - they would let me wheel their perambulators . "
7347	7353	7354	7354	he	340	" You took me in , "
7357	7365	7354	7354	he	340	" It is really a smart dodge . "
7373	7384	7370	7370	he	340	" What do you call this tremendous President of yours ? "
7385	7392	7394	7394	Gregory	110	" We generally call him Sunday , "
7529	7529	7530	7530	He	343	"
7547	7560	7561	7561	he	343	" I feel somehow as if you were my mother , Syme , "
7565	7648	7561	7561	he	343	" I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody . In fact , I will confide to you something that I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes . We shall , of course , go through a form of election ; but I do n't mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be . "
7657	7671	7649	7649	He	343	" It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday . "
7672	7677	7679	7679	Syme	92	" My dear fellow . "
7682	7691	7679	7679	Syme	92	" I congratulate you . A great career ! "
7706	7722	7723	7723	he	343	" As a matter of fact , everything is ready for me on this table , "
7726	7737	7723	7723	he	343	" and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible . "
7803	7815	7817	7817	Gregory	110	" I have only to get the form of election finished , "
7821	7880	7817	7817	Gregory	110	" then I snatch up this cloak and stick , stuff these other things into my pocket , step out of a door in this cavern , which opens on the river , where there is a steam - tug already waiting for me , and then - then - oh , the wild joy of being Thursday ! "
7912	7917	7918	7918	he	92	" Why is it , "
7922	7942	7918	7918	he	92	" that I think you are quite a decent fellow ? Why do I positively like you , Gregory ? "
7958	7968	7943	7943	He	92	" Is it because you are such an ass ? "
7982	8054	7978	7978	he	92	" Well , damn it all ! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly . Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place . That promise I would keep under red - hot pincers . Would you give me , for my own safety , a little promise of the same kind ? "
8055	8059	8061	8061	Gregory	110	" A promise ? "
8065	8068	8070	8070	Syme	92	" Yes , "
8074	8118	8070	8070	Syme	92	" a promise . I swore before God that I would not tell your secret to the police . Will you swear by Humanity , or whatever beastly thing you believe in , that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ? "
8119	8123	8125	8127	the staring Gregory	110	" Your secret ? "
8129	8136	8125	8127	the staring Gregory	110	" Have you got a secret ? "
8137	8140	8142	8142	Syme	92	" Yes , "
8144	8150	8142	8142	Syme	92	" I have a secret . "
8156	8161	8142	8142	Syme	92	" Will you swear ? "
8177	8223	8162	8162	Gregory	110	" You must have bewitched me , but I feel a furious curiosity about you . Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me . But look sharp , for they will be here in a couple of minutes . "
8270	8273	8275	8275	Syme	92	" Well , "
8278	8325	8275	8275	Syme	92	" I do n't know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your President . We have known the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard . "
8338	8344	8345	8345	he	92	" What do you say ? "
8352	8355	8357	8357	Syme	92	" Yes , "
8360	8376	8357	8357	Syme	92	" I am a police detective . But I think I hear your friends coming . "
8385	8390	8422	8432	THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY BEFORE one of the fresh faces	102	" Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . "
8496	8505	8506	8506	he	92	" Do n't be such a silly man , "
8517	8548	8506	8506	he	92	" Do n't you see it 's not necessary ? Do n't you see that we 're both in the same boat ? Yes , and jolly sea - sick . "
8567	8578	8580	8580	Syme	92	" Do n't you see we 've checkmated each other ? "
8582	8734	8580	8580	Syme	92	" I ca n't tell the police you are an anarchist . You ca n't tell the anarchists I 'm a policeman . I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am . In short , it 's a lonely , intellectual duel , my head against yours . I 'm a policeman deprived of the help of the police . You , my poor fellow , are an anarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so essential to anarchy . The one solitary difference is in your favour . You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen ; I am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists . I can not betray you , but I might betray myself . Come , come ! wait and see me betray myself . I shall do it so nicely . "
8755	8763	8764	8764	he	92	" I do n't believe in immortality , "
8769	8799	8764	8764	he	92	" but if , after all this , you were to break your word , God would make a hell only for you , to howl in for ever . "
8800	8808	8810	8810	Syme	92	" I shall not break my word , "
8813	8825	8810	8810	Syme	92	" nor will you break yours . Here are your friends . "
8880	8884	8885	8885	he	363	" Comrade Gregory , "
8888	8897	8885	8885	he	363	" I suppose this man is a delegate ? "
8919	8947	8914	8914	Syme	92	" I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate . "
8969	8976	8977	8977	he	363	" What branch do you represent ? "
8981	8990	8992	8992	Syme	92	" I should hardly call it a branch , "
8996	9008	8992	8992	Syme	92	" I should call it at the very least a root . "
9009	9015	9053	9055	The little man	366	" What do you mean ? "
9016	9021	9023	9023	Syme	92	" The fact is , "
9026	9052	9023	9023	Syme	92	" the truth is I am a Sabbatarian . I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday . "
9098	9103	9105	9109	the man with the papers	370	" Well , comrade , "
9114	9128	9105	9109	the man with the papers	370	" I suppose we 'd better give you a seat in the meeting ? "
9129	9139	9141	9141	Syme	92	" If you ask my advice as a friend , "
9146	9153	9141	9141	Syme	92	" I think you 'd better . "
9339	9348	9349	9349	he	366	" I think it is time we began , "
9352	9373	9349	9349	he	366	" the steam - tug is waiting on the river already . I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair . "
9395	9398	9399	9399	he	366	" Comrades , "
9410	9679	9399	9399	he	366	" our meeting to - night is important , though it need not be long . This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council . We have elected many and splendid Thursdays . We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week . As you know , his services to the cause were considerable . He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which , under happier circumstances , ought to have killed everybody on the pier . As you also know , his death was as self - denying as his life , for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk , which beverage he regarded as barbaric , and as involving cruelty to the cow . Cruelty , or anything approaching to cruelty , revolted him always . But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met , but for a harder task . It is difficult properly to praise his qualities , but it is more difficult to replace them . Upon you , comrades , it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday . If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote . If no comrade suggests a name , I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter , who is gone from us , has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence . "
9725	9735	9698	9709	a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard	381	" I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday , "
9742	9747	9749	9750	the chairman	383	" Does anyone second ? "
9764	9774	9776	9777	the chairman	383	" Before I put the matter to the vote , "
9779	9791	9776	9777	the chairman	383	" I will call on Comrade Gregory to make a statement . "
9972	9975	9977	9977	Gregory	110	" Comrades , "
9986	10310	9977	9977	Gregory	110	" it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy , for it is your policy also . Our belief has been slandered , it has been disfigured , it has been utterly confused and concealed , but it has never been altered . Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information , except to us , except to the fountain head . They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels ; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen 's newspapers ; they learn about anarchists from Ally Sloper 's Half - Holiday and the Sporting Times . They never learn about anarchists from anarchists . We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another . The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply . I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof . For it is deep , deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble , as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs . But if , by some incredible accident , there were here to - night a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : ' When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ? What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another ? Suppose ' I would say to him , ' suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history . Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians . Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek . "
10355	10361	10340	10345	the man with the velvet jacket	393	" I 'm not meek ! "
10362	10368	10370	10370	Gregory	110	" Comrade Witherspoon tells us , "
10372	10493	10370	10370	Gregory	110	" that he is not meek . Ah , how little he knows himself ! His words are , indeed , extravagant ; his appearance is ferocious , and even to an ordinary taste unattractive . But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see . I repeat , we are the true early Christians , only that we come too late . We are simple , as they revere simple - look at Comrade Witherspoon . We are modest , as they were modest - look at me . We are merciful - "
10494	10499	10502	10503	Mr. Witherspoon	115	" No , no ! "
10509	10516	10518	10518	Gregory	110	" I say we are merciful , "
10521	10549	10518	10518	Gregory	110	" as the early Christians were merciful . Yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human flesh . We do not eat human flesh - "
10550	10553	10555	10555	Witherspoon	115	" Shame ! "
10557	10561	10555	10555	Witherspoon	115	" Why not ? "
10562	10566	10568	10568	Gregory	110	" Comrade Witherspoon , "
10575	10605	10568	10568	Gregory	110	" is anxious to know why nobody eats him laughter . In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love - "
10606	10611	10613	10613	Witherspoon	114	" No , no ! "
10615	10620	10613	10613	Witherspoon	114	" down with love . "
10621	10628	10630	10630	Gregory	110	" Which is founded upon love , "
10636	10703	10633	10633	his	394	" there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body . Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity . "
10738	10748	10724	10725	the chairman	383	" Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ? "
10818	10827	10804	10804	Syme	92	" Yes , Mr. Chairman , I oppose . "
10886	10889	10890	10890	he	92	" Comrades ! "
10906	11070	10890	10890	he	92	" have we come here for this ? Do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat . Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us , ' Be good , and you will be happy , ' ' Honesty is the best policy , ' and ' Virtue is its own reward ' ? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory 's address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure hear , hear . But I am not a curate loud cheers , and I did not listen to it with pleasure renewed cheers . The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute , forcible , and efficient Thursday hear , hear . "
11071	11166	11196	11196	he	92	" Comrade Gregory has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society . But I say that we are the enemies of society , and so much the worse for society . We are the enemies of society , for society is the enemy of humanity , its oldest and its most pitiless enemy hear , hear . Comrade Gregory has told us apologetically again that we are not murderers . There I agree . We are not murderers , we are executioners cheers . "
11206	11211	11196	11196	he	92	" You damnable hypocrite ! "
11231	11445	11220	11220	his	92	" Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy . He knows as well as I do that I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty . I do not mince words . I do not pretend to . I say that Comrade Gregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities . He is unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities . We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy hear , hear . This is no time for ceremonial politeness , neither is it a time for ceremonial modesty . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe , because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride cheers . I am not a man at all . I am a cause renewed cheers . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall ; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his milk - and - water methods on the Supreme Council , I would offer myself for election - "
11543	11550	11551	11551	he	401	" Stop , you blasted madmen ! "
11565	11570	11551	11551	he	401	" Stop , you - "
11600	11703	11589	11589	Syme	92	" I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it loud and prolonged cheering . To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and public decency , to all these I will reply , ' You are false kings , but you are true prophets . I am come to destroy you , and to fulfil your prophecies . ' "
11735	11752	11720	11720	his	114	" I move , as an amendment , that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post . "
11753	11762	11764	11764	Gregory	110	" Stop all this , I tell you ! "
11772	11780	11764	11764	Gregory	110	" Stop it , it is all - "
11794	11801	11802	11802	he	114	" Does anyone second this amendment ? "
11858	11864	11865	11865	he	404	" I end all this ! "
11876	11888	11865	11865	he	404	" This man can not be elected . He is a - "
11889	11892	11894	11894	Syme	116	" Yes , "
11899	11904	11894	11894	Syme	116	" what is he ? "
11926	11937	11938	11938	he	404	" He is a man quite inexperienced in our work , "
11976	11987	11952	11960	the long , lean man with the American beard	405	" I beg to second the election of Comrade Syme . "
11988	12000	12002	12003	Mr. Buttons	117	" The amendment will , as usual , be put first , "
12012	12020	11952	11960	the long , lean man with the American beard	405	" The question is that Comrade Syme - "
12033	12036	12037	12037	he	404	" Comrades , "
12041	12048	12037	12037	he	404	" I am not a madman . "
12049	12054	12056	12057	Mr. Witherspoon	115	" Oh , oh ! "
12059	12066	12068	12068	Gregory	110	" I am not a madman , "
12082	12155	12068	12068	Gregory	110	" but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like . No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it . I will call it a command . Call it a mad command , but act upon it . Strike , but hear me ! Kill me , but obey me ! Do not elect this man . "
12198	12203	12194	12194	He	115	" Comrade Gregory commands - "
12218	12227	12211	12212	one anarchist	409	" Who are you ? You are not Sunday "
12238	12245	12230	12231	another anarchist	410	" And you are not Thursday . "
12246	12249	12251	12251	Gregory	110	" Comrades , "
12272	12326	12251	12251	Gregory	110	" it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave . If you will not take my command , accept my degradation . I kneel to you . I throw myself at your feet . I implore you . Do not elect this man . "
12327	12331	12333	12334	the chairman	383	" Comrade Gregory , "
12340	12348	12333	12334	the chairman	383	" this is really not quite dignified . "
12397	12416	12382	12383	the chairman	383	" The question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council . "
12558	12564	12566	12566	Gregory	110	" You are a devil ! "
12570	12577	12579	12579	Syme	116	" And you are a gentleman , "
12583	12591	12593	12593	Gregory	110	" It was you that entrapped me , "
12601	12606	12593	12593	Gregory	110	" entrapped me into - "
12607	12611	12613	12613	Syme	116	" Talk sense , "
12616	12687	12689	12689	he	425	" Into what sort of devils ' parliament have you entrapped me , if it comes to that ? You made me swear before I made you . Perhaps we are both doing what we think right . But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession . There is nothing possible between us but honour and death , "
12706	12713	12715	12716	Mr. Buttons	117	" The boat is quite ready , "
12721	12730	12715	12716	Mr. Buttons	117	" Be good enough to step this way . "
12838	12845	12846	12846	he	92	" You have kept your word , "
12856	12908	12846	12846	he	92	" You are a man of honour , and I thank you . You have kept it even down to a small particular . There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair , and which you have certainly given me by the end of it . "
12909	12915	12919	12919	Gregory	110	" What do you mean ? "
12921	12928	12919	12919	Gregory	110	" What did I promise you ? "
12929	12935	12937	12937	Syme	92	" A very entertaining evening , "
13706	13710	13695	13699	a policeman on the Embankment	470	" Good evening . "
13743	13750	13751	13751	he	92	" A good evening is it ? "
13755	13843	13751	13751	he	92	" You fellows would call the end of the world a good evening . Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river ! I tell you that if that were literally human blood , spilt and shining , you would still be standing here as solid as ever , looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on . You policemen are cruel to the poor , but I could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm . "
13844	13850	13852	13853	the policeman	473	" If we are calm , "
13855	13864	13852	13853	the policeman	473	" it is the calm of organised resistance . "
13865	13868	13870	13870	Syme	92	" Eh ? "
13874	13887	13889	13890	the policeman	473	" The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle , "
13892	13905	13889	13890	the policeman	473	" The composure of an army is the anger of a nation . "
13906	13914	13916	13916	Syme	92	" Good God , the Board Schools ! "
13918	13924	13916	13916	Syme	92	" Is this undenominational education ? "
13925	13928	13930	13931	the policeman	473	" No , "
13934	13967	13930	13931	the policeman	473	" I never had any of those advantages . The Board Schools came after my time . What education I had was very rough and old - fashioned , I am afraid . "
13968	13975	13977	13977	Syme	92	" Where did you have it ? "
13981	13987	13989	13990	the policeman	473	" Oh , at Harrow , "
14020	14028	14029	14029	he	473	" But , good Lord , man , "
14032	14041	14029	14029	he	473	" you ought n't to be a policeman ! "
14050	14054	14055	14055	he	473	" I know , "
14059	14067	14055	14055	he	473	" I know I am not worthy . "
14068	14077	14079	14079	Syme	92	" But why did you join the police ? "
14084	14096	14098	14099	the other	310	" For much the same reason that you abused the police , "
14101	14152	14098	14099	the other	310	" I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will . I trust I make myself clear . "
14153	14164	14166	14166	Syme	92	" If you mean that you make your opinion clear , "
14168	14207	14166	14166	Syme	92	" I suppose you do . But as for making yourself clear , it is the last thing you do . How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the Thames embankment ?
14208	14223	14225	14226	the other	310	" You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system , "
14228	14277	14225	14226	the other	310	" I am not surprised at it . We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies . But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind . I think you might almost join us . "
14278	14284	14286	14286	Syme	92	" Join you in what ? "
14288	14294	14296	14297	the policeman	473	" I will tell you , "
14300	14452	14296	14297	the policeman	473	" This is the situation : The head of one of our departments , one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe , has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation . He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State . He has , therefore , formed a special corps of policemen , policemen who are also philosophers . It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense . I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue . But it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt . "
14463	14471	14472	14472	he	92	" What do you do , then ? "
14475	14483	14485	14488	the man in blue	482	" The work of the philosophical policeman , "
14490	14617	14485	14488	the man in blue	482	" is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective . The ordinary detective goes to pot - houses to arrest thieves ; we go to artistic tea - parties to detect pessimists . The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed . We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed . We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime . We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartle pool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks a smart young fellow thoroughly understood a triolet . "
14618	14623	14625	14625	Syme	92	" Do you mean , "
14627	14645	14625	14625	Syme	92	" that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ? "
14646	14653	14655	14656	the policeman	473	" You are not sufficiently democratic , "
14658	14922	14655	14656	the policeman	473	" but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business . I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate . But this new movement of ours is a very different affair . We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals . We remember the Roman Emperors . We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance . We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal . We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher . Compared to him , burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men ; my heart goes out to them . They accept the essential ideal of man ; they merely seek it wrongly . Thieves respect property . They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it . But philosophers dislike property as property ; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession . Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy . But philosophers despise marriage as marriage . Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives . But philosophers hate life itself , their own as much as other people 's . "
14929	14935	14936	14936	he	92	" How true that is , "
14939	15127	14936	14936	he	92	" I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis . The common criminal is a bad man , but at least he is , as it were , a conditional good man . He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed - say a wealthy uncle - he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise God . He is a reformer , but not an anarchist . He wishes to cleanse the edifice , but not to destroy it . But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them . Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate . It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church . The moderns say we must not punish heretics . My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else . "
15128	15134	15136	15137	the policeman	473	" But this is absurd ! "
15154	15231	15136	15137	the policeman	473	" but it is intolerable ! I do n't know what you 're doing , but you 're wasting your life . You must , you shall , join our special army against anarchy . Their armies are on our frontiers . Their bolt is ready to fall . A moment more , and you may lose the glory of working with us , perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world . "
15232	15244	15246	15246	Syme	92	" It is a chance not to be missed , certainly , "
15248	15316	15246	15246	Syme	92	" but still I do not quite understand . I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements . But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other . How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt . What is this anarchy ? "
15317	15323	15325	15326	the constable	485	" Do not confuse it , "
15328	15522	15325	15326	the constable	485	" with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring . You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring - the main mass of their supporters - are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime . They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section . "
15523	15526	15528	15528	Syme	92	" Oh ! "
15530	15612	15615	15616	the policeman	473	" Naturally , therefore , these people talk about ' a happy time coming ' ; ' the paradise of the future ' ; ' mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue , ' and so on . And so also the men of the inner circle speak - the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths "
15621	15701	15618	15618	his	473	" in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning . They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle . And they mean death . When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide . When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave .
15756	15756	15864	15865	the policeman	473	"
15757	15764	15766	15766	Syme	92	" How can I join you ? "
15774	15789	15791	15792	the policeman	473	" I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment , "
15794	15848	15791	15792	the policeman	473	" as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken . You should really come and see him . Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like . "
15849	15852	15854	15854	Syme	92	" Telephone ? "
15859	15862	15864	15865	the policeman	473	" No , "
15868	15895	15864	15865	the policeman	473	" he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch - dark room . He says it makes his thoughts brighter . Do come along . "
15990	15997	16046	16046	his	324	" Are you the new recruit ? "
16051	16058	16060	16071	the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it	499	" Are you the new recruit ? "
16073	16081	16060	16071	the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it	499	" All right . You are engaged . "
16099	16106	16107	16107	he	92	" I really have no experience , "
16110	16117	16119	16120	the other	310	" No one has any experience , "
16122	16129	16119	16120	the other	310	" of the Battle of Armageddon . "
16130	16137	16184	16185	the other	310	" But I am really unfit - "
16138	16147	16149	16150	the unknown	501	" You are willing , that is enough , "
16152	16157	16159	16159	Syme	92	" Well , really , "
16161	16177	16159	16159	Syme	92	" I do n't know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test . "
16178	16182	16184	16185	the other	310	" I do , "
16187	16200	16184	16185	the other	310	" martyrs . I am condemning you to death . Good day . "
16346	16351	16331	16332	his friend	505	" The Last Crusade , "
17608	17617	17618	17618	he	324	" If we walk up towards Leicester Square , "
17621	17645	17618	17618	he	324	" we shall just be in time for breakfast . Sunday always insists on an early breakfast . Have you had any sleep ? "
17646	17649	17651	17651	Syme	92	" No , "
17653	17658	17660	17661	the man	324	" Nor have I , "
17667	17678	17660	17661	the man	324	" I shall try to get to bed after breakfast . "
17729	17915	17724	17725	the man	324	" Of course , the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told . But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest . So in case you do n't know , I 'd better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now . Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does . Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant . He said that if you did n't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out . Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age . For now we flaunt ourselves before the public . We have our breakfast on a balcony - on a balcony , if you please - overlooking Leicester Square . "
17916	17924	17926	17926	Syme	92	" And what do the people say ? "
17928	17937	17939	17940	his guide	563	" It 's quite simple what they say , "
17942	17958	17724	17725	the man	324	" They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists . "
17959	17969	17971	17971	Syme	92	" It seems to me a very clever idea , "
17973	17983	17986	17987	the other	310	" Clever ! God blast your impudence ! Clever ! "
18005	18023	17986	17987	the other	310	" When you 've seen Sunday for a split second you 'll leave off calling him clever . "
18646	18655	18656	18656	he	598	" The gentlemen are up there , sare , "
18659	18683	18656	18656	he	598	" They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk . They do say they will throw bombs at ze king . "
19328	19333	19335	19336	the President	2559	" Our friend Tuesday , "
19348	19483	19335	19336	the President	2559	" our friend Tuesday does n't seem to grasp the idea . He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one . He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator . Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock - coat , no one need know that he is an anarchist . But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock - coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees - well , he may attract attention . That 's what Brother Gogol does . He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy , that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright . "
19484	19492	19494	19494	Gogol	125	" I am not good at goncealment , "
19503	19512	19494	19494	Gogol	125	" I am not ashamed of the cause . "
19513	19529	19531	19532	the President	2559	" Yes you are , my boy , and so is the cause of you , "
19537	19633	19531	19532	the President	2559	" You hide as much as anybody ; but you ca n't do it , you see , you 're such an ass ! You try to combine two inconsistent methods . When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance . But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat , you will agree with me , my dear Tuesday , that he is not likely even to forget it . Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin 's bed - "
19634	19642	19644	19644	Tuesday	126	" I am not good at deception , "
19649	19657	19659	19660	the President	2559	" Right , my boy , right , "
19666	19674	19659	19660	the President	2559	" you are n't good at anything . "
22240	22246	22248	22249	the Marquis	740	" I have often wondered , "
22264	22313	22248	22249	the Marquis	740	" whether it would n't be better for me to do it with a knife . Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife . And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round . "
22314	22319	22321	22322	the Secretary	698	" You are wrong , "
22330	22406	22407	22407	he	111	" The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant . Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol . It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians . It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens . A man 's brain is a bomb , "
22424	22458	22407	22407	he	111	" My brain feels like a bomb , night and day . It must expand ! It must expand ! A man 's brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe . "
22459	22471	22473	22474	the Marquis	740	" I do n't want the universe broken up just yet , "
22476	22498	22473	22474	the Marquis	740	" I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die . I thought of one yesterday in bed . "
22499	22512	22514	22515	Dr. Bull	135	" No , if the only end of the thing is nothing , "
22523	22530	22514	22515	Dr. Bull	135	" it hardly seems worth doing . "
22543	22551	22552	22552	he	742	" Every man knows in his heart , "
22555	22562	22552	22552	he	742	" that nothing is worth doing . "
22575	22633	22571	22572	the Secretary	698	" We are wandering , however , from the point . The only question is how Wednesday is to strike the blow . I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb . As to the actual arrangements , I should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all to - "
22661	22667	22668	22668	he	111	" Before we discuss that , "
22677	22694	22668	22668	he	111	" let us go into a private room . I have something vent particular to say . "
23062	23071	23060	23060	Roland	136	" Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit . "
23321	23326	23327	23327	he	125	" Zso ! Zso ! "
23343	23375	23327	23327	he	125	" You zay you nod ' ide . You zay you show himselves . It is all nuzzinks . Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box ! "
23391	23403	23404	23404	he	2559	" You ca n't get hold of it yet , Gogol , "
23411	23460	23404	23404	he	2559	" When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where we go afterwards . If we had come here first , we should have had the whole staff at the keyhole . You do n't seem to know anything about mankind . "
23461	23467	23469	23470	the Pole	785	" I die for zem , "
23475	23501	23469	23470	the Pole	785	" and I slay zare oppressors . I care not for these games of gonzealment . I would zmite ze tyrant in ze open square . "
23502	23509	23511	23512	the President	2559	" I see , I see , "
23528	23588	23517	23517	he	2559	" You die for mankind first , and then you get up and smite their oppressors . So that 's all right . And now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments , and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table . For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said . "
23667	23670	23672	23673	the President	2559	" Comrades , "
23678	23774	23672	23673	the President	2559	" we have spun out this farce long enough . I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs long inured to our levities might hear some new seriousness in my voice . Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places . I propose , before saying anything else , that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting , but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member . I suggest Comrade Saturday , Dr. Bull . "
23810	23845	23805	23805	Sunday	111	" Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting . Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company . "
23933	24008	23928	23928	Sunday	111	" You will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom . Strangers overhearing us matters nothing . They assume that we are joking . But what would matter , even unto death , is this , that there should be one actually among us who is not of us , who knows our grave purpose , but does not share it , who - "
24018	24024	24025	24025	he	698	" It ca n't be ! "
24030	24035	24025	24025	he	698	" There ca n't - "
24054	24057	24058	24058	he	2559	" Yes , "
24062	24089	24058	24058	he	2559	" there is a spy in this room . There is a traitor at this table . I will waste no more words . His name - "
24104	24110	24112	24113	the President	2559	" His name is Gogol , "
24115	24130	24112	24113	the President	2559	" He is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a Pole . "
24205	24209	24211	24211	Sunday	111	" SIT down ! "
24253	24259	24261	24262	the President	2559	" Well , my man , "
24274	24296	24261	24262	the President	2559	" will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ? "
24405	24409	24411	24412	the President	2559	" Pathetic Slav , "
24414	24444	24411	24412	the President	2559	" tragic child of Poland , are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company - shall we say de trop ? "
24445	24449	24451	24453	the late Gogol	125	" Right oh ! "
24494	24504	24506	24506	Sunday	111	" I gather that you fully understand your position , "
24508	24512	24514	24515	the Pole	785	" You bet , "
24517	24547	24514	24515	the Pole	785	" I see it 's a fair cop . All I say is , I do n't believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his . "
24548	24554	24556	24556	Sunday	111	" I concede the point , "
24558	24587	24556	24556	Sunday	111	" I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath . Do you mind leaving your beard with your card ? "
24588	24593	24595	24595	Gogol	125	" Not a bit , "
24625	24630	24631	24631	he	125	" It was hot , "
24634	24644	24646	24646	Sunday	111	" I will do you the justice to say , "
24656	24745	24646	24646	Sunday	111	" that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it . Now listen to me . I like you . The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments . Well , if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us , I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort . On your discomfort I will not dwell . Good day . Mind the step . "
24814	24819	24821	24822	the President	2559	" Time is flying , "
24847	24866	24824	24824	his	2559	" I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting . "
24876	24883	24884	24884	he	698	" Would it not be better , "
24890	24908	24884	24884	he	698	" to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ? "
24909	24916	24918	24919	the President	2559	" No , I think not , "
24928	24950	24918	24919	the President	2559	" Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday . "
24980	24993	24994	24994	he	698	" I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular , "
24997	25033	24994	24994	he	698	" It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor - "
25034	25037	25039	25040	the President	2559	" Secretary , "
25043	25070	25039	25040	the President	2559	" if you 'd take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful . I ca n't say . But it might .
25082	25089	25090	25090	he	698	" I really fail to understand - "
25096	25105	25107	25108	the President	2559	" That 's it , that 's it , "
25116	25136	25137	25137	he	2559	" That 's where you fail right enough . You fail to understand . Why , you dancing donkey , "
25142	25168	25137	25137	he	2559	" you did n't want to be overheard by a spy , did n't you ? How do you know you are n't overheard now ? "
26133	26142	26143	26143	he	92	" Can that old corpse be following me ? "
26152	26222	26145	26145	himself	92	" I stopped too long up in that room , so that even such leaden feet could catch me up . One comfort is , with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo . Or am I too fanciful ? Was he really following me ? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man ? "
27543	27553	27554	27554	He	133	" the crooked man who went a crooked mile . "
27719	27726	27699	27699	He	92	" Catch me if you can , "
28172	28178	28159	28161	the old anarchist	945	" Are you a policeman ? "
28216	28220	28221	28221	he	92	" A policeman ? "
28227	28240	28221	28221	he	92	" Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ? "
28241	28248	28250	28251	the Professor	798	" The process was simple enough , "
28254	28268	28250	28251	the Professor	798	" I thought you looked like a policeman . I think so now . "
28269	28284	28286	28286	Syme	92	" Did I take a policeman 's hat by mistake out of the restaurant ? "
28291	28330	28286	28286	Syme	92	" Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ? Have my boots got that watchful look ? Why must I be a policeman ? Do , do let me be a postman . "
28354	28446	28335	28335	his	742	" But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy . Perhaps policeman is a relative term . In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade . The monkey is only the policeman that may be . Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being anything in German thought . "
28447	28455	28457	28459	the old man	879	" Are you in the police service ? "
28470	28476	28457	28459	the old man	879	" Are you a detective ? "
28490	28496	28497	28497	he	92	" Your suggestion is ridiculous , "
28500	28505	28497	28497	he	92	" Why on earth - "
28523	28537	28538	28538	he	879	" Did you hear me ask a plain question , you pattering spy ? "
28547	28560	28538	28538	he	879	" Are you , or are you not , a police detective ? "
28561	28564	28566	28566	Syme	92	" No ! "
28578	28583	28585	28587	the old man	879	" You swear it , "
28604	28683	28585	28587	the old man	879	" You swear it ! You swear it ! If you swear falsely , will you be damned ? Will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ? Will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave ? Will there really be no mistake ? You are an anarchist , you are a dynamiter ! Above all , you are not in any sense a detective ? You are not in the British police ? "
28708	28717	28719	28719	Syme	92	" I am not in the British police , "
28740	28746	28747	28747	he	133	" That 's a pity , "
28750	28755	28747	28747	he	133	" because I am . "
28771	28777	28778	28778	he	92	" Because you are what ? "
28782	28787	28778	28778	he	92	" You are what ? "
28788	28794	28796	28797	the Professor	798	" I am a policeman , "
28810	28875	28880	28880	he	798	" But as you think policeman only a relative term , of course I have nothing to do with you . I am in the British police force ; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force , I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters ' club . I suppose I ought to arrest you . "
29227	29235	29237	29242	one wondering labourer from the docks	965	" What yer laughing at , guv'nor ? "
29244	29248	29250	29250	Syme	92	" At myself , "
29264	29269	29271	29272	the Professor	798	" Pull yourself together , "
29274	29291	29271	29272	the Professor	798	" or you 'll get hysterical . Have some more beer . I 'll join you . "
29292	29300	29302	29302	Syme	92	" You have n't drunk your milk , "
29304	29308	29310	29311	the other	310	" My milk ! "
29321	29357	29358	29358	he	310	" my milk ! Do you think I 'd look at the beastly stuff when I 'm out of sight of the bloody anarchists ? We 're all Christians in this room , though perhaps , "
29368	29389	29391	29391	he	310	" not strict ones . Finish my milk ? Great blazes ! yes , I 'll finish it right enough ! "
29421	29426	29427	29427	he	92	" I understand now , "
29430	29443	29427	29427	he	92	" of course , you 're not an old man at all . "
29444	29454	29456	29458	Professor de Worms	133	" I ca n't take my face off here , "
29460	29495	29456	29458	Professor de Worms	133	" It 's rather an elaborate make - up . As to whether I 'm an old man , that 's not for me to say . I was thirty - eight last birthday . "
29496	29503	29505	29505	Syme	92	" Yes , but I mean , "
29508	29517	29505	29505	Syme	92	" there 's nothing the matter with you . "
29518	29521	29523	29524	the other	310	" Yes , "
29527	29534	29523	29524	the other	310	" I am subject to colds . "
29601	29606	29607	29607	he	92	" Did you know , "
29610	29620	29607	29607	he	92	" that that man Gogol was one of us ? "
29621	29632	29634	29634	Syme	92	" I ? No , I did n't know it , "
29639	29645	29634	29634	Syme	92	" But did n't you ? "
29646	29655	29657	29663	the man who called himself de Worms	974	" I knew no more than the dead , "
29665	29682	29657	29663	the man who called himself de Worms	974	" I thought the President was talking about me , and I rattled in my boots . "
29683	29693	29695	29695	Syme	92	" And I thought he was talking about me , "
29703	29715	29698	29698	his	92	" I had my hand on my revolver all the time . "
29716	29721	29723	29724	the Professor	798	" So had I , "
29733	29733	29730	29730	Gogol	125	"
29742	29752	29753	29753	he	92	" Why , there were three of us there ! "
29756	29776	29753	29753	he	92	" Three out of seven is a fighting number . If we had only known that we were three ! "
29792	29797	29798	29798	he	798	" We were three , "
29801	29815	29798	29798	he	798	" If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing . "
29816	29826	29828	29828	Syme	92	" Not if we were three hundred against four ? "
29834	29837	29839	29840	the Professor	798	" No , "
29844	29854	29839	29840	the Professor	798	" not if we were three hundred against Sunday . "
29979	29982	29983	29983	he	92	" Professor , "
29986	29998	29983	29983	he	92	" it is intolerable . Are you afraid of this man ? "
30025	30031	30032	30032	he	798	" Yes , I am , "
30036	30041	30032	30032	he	798	" So are you . "
30070	30073	30074	30074	he	92	" Yes , "
30081	30139	30074	30074	he	92	" you are right . I am afraid of him . Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I find him , and strike him on the mouth . If heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool , I swear that I would pull him down . "
30140	30143	30145	30147	the staring Professor	982	" How ? "
30149	30152	30145	30147	the staring Professor	982	" Why ? "
30153	30161	30163	30163	Syme	92	" Because I am afraid of him , "
30165	30181	30163	30163	Syme	92	" and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid . "
30218	30343	30202	30202	Syme	92	" Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ? Who would debase himself to be merely brave , like any common prizefighter ? Who would stoop to be fearless - like a tree ? Fight the thing that you fear . You remember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily , and how on his death - bed the great robber said , ' I can give you no money , but I can give you advice for a lifetime : your thumb on the blade , and strike upwards . ' So I say to you , strike upwards , if you strike at the stars . "
30359	30366	30367	30367	he	310	" Sunday is a fixed star , "
30370	30379	30381	30381	Syme	92	" You shall see him a falling star , "
30402	30408	30409	30409	he	310	" Have you any idea , "
30419	30426	30409	30409	he	310	" exactly where you are going ? "
30427	30430	30432	30432	Syme	92	" Yes , "
30435	30448	30432	30432	Syme	92	" I am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in Paris . "
30449	30456	30458	30459	the other	310	" Have you any conception how ? "
30461	30464	30466	30466	Syme	92	" No , "
30471	30478	30488	30488	his	133	" You remember , of course , "
30497	30569	30488	30488	his	133	" that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the Marquis and Dr. Bull . The Marquis is by this time probably crossing the Channel . But where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even the President knows ; certainly we do n't know . The only man who does know is Dr. Bull .
30570	30574	30576	30576	Syme	92	" Confound it ! "
30578	30588	30576	30576	Syme	92	" And we do n't know where he is . "
30589	30592	30594	30595	the other	310	" Yes , "
30605	30613	30594	30595	the other	310	" I know where he is myself . "
30614	30620	30622	30622	Syme	92	" Will you tell me ? "
30627	30634	30636	30637	the Professor	798	" I will take you there , "
30661	30667	30668	30668	he	92	" What do you mean ? "
30672	30684	30668	30668	he	92	" Will you join me ? Will you take the risk ? "
30685	30689	30691	30692	the Professor	798	" Young man , "
30695	30760	30691	30692	the Professor	798	" I am amused to observe that you think I am a coward . As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down the President . I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it , "
30898	30904	30905	30905	Syme	92	" Where are you going ? "
30908	30912	30914	30915	the Professor	798	" Just now , "
30917	30943	30914	30915	the Professor	798	" I am going just round the corner to see whether Dr. Bull has gone to bed . He is hygienic , and retires early . "
30944	30948	30950	30950	Syme	92	" Dr. Bull ! "
30952	30960	30950	30950	Syme	92	" Does he live round the corner ? "
30961	30964	31007	31007	he	798	" No , "
30969	31002	31007	31007	he	798	" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed . "
31173	31179	31180	31180	he	133	" We are too late , "
31183	31192	31180	31180	he	133	" the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed . "
31193	31199	31201	31201	Syme	92	" What do you mean ? "
31203	31212	31201	31201	Syme	92	" Does he live over there , then ? "
31213	31216	31218	31219	de Worms	133	" Yes , "
31221	31249	31218	31219	de Worms	133	" behind that particular window which you ca n't see . Come along and get some dinner . We must call on him to - morrow morning . "
31334	31349	31351	31352	the Professor	798	" You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils , "
31354	31366	31351	31352	the Professor	798	" I once found a decent place in the West End . "
31367	31371	31373	31373	Syme	92	" I suppose , "
31377	31390	31373	31373	Syme	92	" that this is the corresponding decent place in the East End ? "
31391	31395	31397	31398	the Professor	798	" It is , "
31606	31617	31619	31619	Syme	92	" That 's a good get - up of yours , "
31627	31649	31619	31619	Syme	92	" a lot better than old Gogol 's . Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy . "
31650	31657	31659	31660	the Professor	798	" A difference of artistic theory , "
31663	31716	31659	31660	the Professor	798	" Gogol was an idealist . He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist . But I am a realist . I am a portrait painter . But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression . I am a portrait . "
31717	31724	31726	31726	Syme	92	" I do n't understand you , "
31728	31734	31736	31737	the Professor	798	" I am a portrait , "
31739	31760	31736	31737	the Professor	798	" I am a portrait of the celebrated Professor de Worms , who is , I believe , in Naples . "
31761	31771	31773	31773	Syme	92	" You mean you are made up like him , "
31775	31790	31773	31773	Syme	92	" But does n't he know that you are taking his nose in vain ? "
31791	31798	31800	31801	his friend	505	" He knows it right enough , "
31804	31813	31736	31737	the Professor	798	" Then why does n't he denounce you ? "
31814	31820	31822	31823	the Professor	798	" I have denounced him , "
31825	31830	31832	31832	Syme	92	" Do explain yourself , "
31834	31847	31849	31852	the eminent foreign philosopher	1033	" With pleasure , if you do n't mind hearing my story , "
31854	32310	31849	31852	the eminent foreign philosopher	1033	" I am by profession an actor , and my name is Wilks . When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company . Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf , sometimes the riff - raff of the arts , and occasionally the political refugee . In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher , Professor de Worms . I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully . I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces . Energy , he said , was the All . He was lame , shortsighted , and partially paralytic . When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him . If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature . I was only an actor , I could only act a caricature . I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor 's dirty old self . When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter , or if they were too far gone with a roar of indignation at the insult . I can not describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence , followed when I had first opened my lips with a murmur of admiration . The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me . I had been too subtle , I had been too true . They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor . I was a healthy - minded young man at the time , and I confess that it was a blow . Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room . I inquired its nature . It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself . I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through . Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room .
32311	32753	33164	33165	the Professor	798	" I need hardly say there was a collision . The pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to see which was really the more feeble . But I won . An old man in poor health , like my rival , could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life . You see , he really had paralysis , and working within this definite limitation , he could n't be so jolly paralytic as I was . Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually . I countered that by a very simple dodge . Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand , I replied with something which I could not even understand myself . ' I do n't fancy , ' he said , ' that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation . ' I replied quite scornfully , ' You read all that up in Pinckwerts ; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe . ' It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe . But the people all round rather to my surprise seemed to remember them quite well , and the Professor , finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples , fell back upon a more popular form of wit . ' I see , ' he sneered , ' you prevail like the false pig in Aesop . ' ' And you fail , ' I answered , smiling , ' like the hedgehog in Montaigne . ' Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne ? ' Your claptrap comes off , ' he said ; ' so would your beard . ' I had no intelligent answer to this , which was quite true and rather witty . But I laughed heartily , answered , ' Like the Pantheist 's boots , ' at random , and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory . The real Professor was thrown out , but not with violence , though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose . He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor . His apparent earnestness and anger , you see , make him all the more entertaining . "
32754	32757	32759	32759	Syme	92	" Well , "
32761	32791	32759	32759	Syme	92	" I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night 's practical joke , but I do n't understand your never taking it off again . "
32792	32801	32803	32804	the impersonator	1034	" That is the rest of the story , "
32806	33111	32803	32804	the impersonator	1034	" When I myself left the company , followed by reverent applause , I went limping down the dark street , hoping that I should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being . To my astonishment , as I was turning the corner , I felt a touch on the shoulder , and turning , found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman . He told me I was wanted . I struck a sort of paralytic attitude , and cried in a high German accent , ' Yes , I am wanted - by the oppressed of the world . You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist , Professor de Worms . ' The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand , ' No , sir , ' he said civilly , ' at least , not exactly , sir . I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist , Professor de Worms . ' This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed . I was shown into a number of rooms , and eventually into the presence of a police officer , who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy , and that this , my successful masquerade , might be of considerable value to the public safety . He offered me a good salary and this little blue card . Though our conversation was short , he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour ; but I can not tell you much about him personally , because - "
33120	33124	33125	33125	he	92	" I know , "
33128	33139	33125	33125	he	92	" because you talked to him in a dark room . "
33155	33162	33169	33169	he	798	" BURGUNDY is a jolly thing , "
33175	33185	33187	33187	Syme	92	" You do n't look as if it were , "
33189	33199	33187	33187	Syme	92	" you drink it as if it were medicine . "
33200	33207	33209	33210	the Professor	798	" You must excuse my manner , "
33213	33346	33209	33210	the Professor	798	" my position is rather a curious one . Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well , that now I ca n't leave off . So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still ca n't help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead - just as if it were my forehead . I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way . The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart , but they come out of my mouth quite different . You should hear me say , ' Buck up , old cock ! ' It would bring tears to your eyes . "
33347	33351	33353	33353	Syme	92	" It does , "
33355	33374	33353	33353	Syme	92	" but I can not help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried . "
33386	33394	33395	33395	he	798	" You are a very clever fellow , "
33398	33428	33395	33395	he	798	" it is a pleasure to work with you . Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head . There is a great problem to face , "
33448	33455	33441	33441	he	798	" Can you play the piano ? "
33456	33459	33461	33461	Syme	92	" Yes , "
33466	33476	33461	33461	Syme	92	" I 'm supposed to have a good touch . "
33489	33498	33486	33486	he	798	" I trust the great cloud is lifted . "
33516	33531	33504	33505	the Professor	798	" It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter . "
33532	33536	33538	33538	Syme	92	" Thank you , "
33540	33545	33538	33538	Syme	92	" you flatter me . "
33546	33551	33553	33554	the other	310	" Listen to me , "
33556	33759	33553	33554	the other	310	" and remember whom we have to see tomorrow . You and I are going to - morrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower . We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp , very strong , and very wicked man . I believe there is no man , except the President , of course , who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles . He has not perhaps the white - hot enthusiasm unto death , the mad martyrdom for anarchy , which marks the Secretary . But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait . But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the Secretary 's disease . Do n't you notice his detestable virility and vitality . He bounces like an india - rubber ball . Depend on it , Sunday was not asleep I wonder if he ever sleeps ? when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of Dr. Bull . "
33760	33765	33767	33767	Syme	92	" And you think , "
33769	33785	33767	33767	Syme	92	" that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him ? "
33786	33793	33795	33796	his mentor	1041	" Do n't be an ass , "
33798	33863	33865	33865	he	1041	" I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers . Syme , if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive , we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see . I have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers - like this , see , "
33875	33889	33865	33865	he	1041	" B A D , bad , a word we may frequently require . "
33995	34004	34006	34006	Syme	92	" We must have several word - signs , "
34009	34035	34006	34006	Syme	92	" words that we are likely to want , fine shades of meaning . My favourite word is ' coeval . ' What 's yours ? "
34036	34043	34045	34046	the Professor	798	" Do stop playing the goat , "
34049	34059	34045	34046	the Professor	798	" You do n't know how serious this is . "
34060	34067	34069	34069	Syme	92	" ' Lush , ' too , "
34076	34094	34072	34072	his	92	" we must have ' lush ' - word applied to grass , do n't you know ? "
34095	34100	34102	34103	the Professor	798	" Do you imagine , "
34106	34119	34102	34103	the Professor	798	" that we are going to talk to Dr. Bull about grass ? "
34120	34133	34135	34135	Syme	92	" There are several ways in which the subject could be approached , "
34138	34186	34135	34135	Syme	92	" and the word introduced without appearing forced . We might say , ' Dr. Bull , as a revolutionist , you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass ; and indeed many of us , looking on the fresh lush grass of summer ' "
34187	34192	34194	34195	the other	310	" Do you understand , "
34197	34204	34194	34195	the other	310	" that this is a tragedy ? "
34205	34208	34210	34210	Syme	92	" Perfectly , "
34212	34271	34210	34210	Syme	92	" always be comic in a tragedy . What the deuce else can you do ? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope . I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation , which however unobtrusively performed - "
34272	34275	34277	34278	his friend	505	" Syme , "
34284	34289	34277	34278	his friend	505	" go to bed ! "
34421	34424	34426	34426	Syme	92	" Well , "
34438	34457	34432	34432	he	92	" I dreamt of that alphabet of yours . Did it take you long to make it up ? "
34485	34525	34480	34480	Syme	92	" I say , did it take you long to invent all this ? I 'm considered good at these things , and it was a good hour 's grind . Did you learn it all on the spot ? "
34547	34555	34538	34538	he	798	" How long did it take you ? "
34562	34571	34574	34574	Syme	92	" Confound you , ca n't you answer ? "
34808	34823	34824	34824	He	92	" I will only talk like this . We must get used to it . "
34835	34846	34824	34824	He	92	" All right . Let 's get out to breakfast . "
35521	35533	35535	35535	he	798	" I 'm sorry to disturb you so early , comrade , "
35548	35562	35535	35535	he	798	" You have no doubt made all the arrangements for the Paris affair ? "
35570	35587	35564	35564	he	798	" We have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment 's delay . "
35613	35721	35602	35603	The Professor	798	" Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him . Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on it . I will , however , relate the occurrence in detail , even at the risk of losing time , if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss . "
35959	35964	35966	35967	the Professor	798	" As I say , "
35977	36023	35966	35967	the Professor	798	" the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the Marquis , is one which you may think it better to have narrated ; but as it came in the way of Comrade Syme rather than me - "
36064	36077	36059	36059	He	116	" You must go on . This devil has sucked me dry ! "
36098	36108	36109	36109	he	116	" Yes , the thing really happened to me , "
36113	36188	36109	36109	he	116	" I had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me , thanks to my hat , for a respectable person . Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability , I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy . Under this influence he became friendly , and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France .
36200	36200	36193	36193	I	0	"
36242	36277	36233	36233	he	798	" Syme immediately brought this information to me , and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it . It seems to me unquestionably urgent that - "
36345	36351	36338	36338	His	116	" I have an intuition . "
36366	36372	36352	36353	The Professor	798	" Then sit on it . "
36376	36382	36373	36373	Syme	116	" It is quite extraordinary . "
36387	36391	36383	36384	The other	310	" Extraordinary rot ! "
36395	36401	36392	36392	Syme	116	" I am a poet . "
36406	36413	36402	36403	The other	310	" You are a dead man . "
36462	36486	36456	36456	he	116	" You scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is . It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring . "
36502	36507	36487	36487	He	116	" Go to hell ! "
36521	36528	36530	36530	Syme	116	" Perhaps I should rather say , "
36535	36556	36530	36530	Syme	116	" that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods . "
36563	36568	36570	36570	Syme	116	" Or yet again , "
36572	36588	36570	36570	Syme	116	" it is positive , as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman . "
36624	36628	36607	36607	He	116	" Dr. Bull ! "
36656	36660	36662	36662	Syme	116	" Dr. Bull , "
36672	36693	36662	36662	Syme	116	" would you do me a small favour ? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles ? "
36953	36961	36963	36963	Syme	116	" I knew I was a poet , "
36970	37024	36963	36963	Syme	116	" I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope . It was the spectacles that did it ! It was all the spectacles . Given those beastly black eyes , and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks , made him a live devil among dead ones . "
37025	37034	37036	37037	the Professor	798	" It certainly does make a queer difference , "
37040	37050	37036	37037	the Professor	798	" But as regards the project of Dr. Bull - "
37051	37056	37058	37058	Syme	116	" Project be damned ! "
37063	37099	37058	37058	Syme	116	" Look at him ! Look at his face , look at his collar , look at his blessed boots ! You do n't suppose , do you , that that thing 's an anarchist ? "
37100	37103	37105	37106	the other	310	" Syme ! "
37112	37118	37120	37120	Syme	116	" Why , by God , "
37122	37146	37148	37148	he	116	" I 'll take the risk of that myself ! Dr. Bull , I am a police officer . There 's my card , "
37207	37219	37220	37220	he	1133	" I 'm awfully glad you chaps have come so early , "
37230	37250	37220	37220	he	1133	" for we can all start for France together . Yes , I 'm in the force right enough , "
37322	37328	37329	37329	he	116	" But Lord God Almighty , "
37333	37355	37329	37329	he	116	" if this is all right , there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned Council ! "
37356	37363	37365	37365	Bull	135	" We might have fought easily , "
37367	37374	37365	37365	Bull	135	" we were four against three . "
37390	37393	37383	37383	his	798	" No , "
37398	37418	37383	37383	his	798	" we were not four against three - we were not so lucky . We were four against One . "
37482	37491	37492	37492	he	1140	" It is jolly to get some pals , "
37495	37541	37492	37492	he	1140	" I 've been half dead with the jumps , being quite alone . I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him , which would have been imprudent . I hope you wo n't despise me for having been in a blue funk . "
37542	37551	37553	37553	Syme	116	" All the blue devils in blue hell , "
37555	37573	37553	37553	Syme	116	" contributed to my blue funk ! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles . "
37580	37587	37588	37588	he	1140	" Was n't it a rag ? "
37591	37966	37588	37588	he	1140	" Such a simple idea - not my own . I have n't got the brains . You see , I wanted to go into the detective service , especially the anti - dynamite business . But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter . They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution . They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic , and too reliable and benevolent ; they called me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard . They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal . But as last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders . And there the others all talked hopelessly . One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark . ' A pair of smoked spectacles will do it , ' he said positively . ' Look at him now ; he looks like an angelic office boy . Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles , and children will scream at the sight of him . ' And so it was , by George ! When once my eyes were covered , all the rest , smile and big shoulders and short hair , made me look a perfect little devil . As I say , it was simple enough when it was done , like miracles ; but that was n't the really miraculous part of it . There was one really staggering thing about the business , and my head still turns at it . "
37967	37972	37974	37974	Syme	116	" What was that ? "
37976	37982	37984	37987	the man in spectacles	1146	" I 'll tell you , "
37989	38025	37984	37987	the man in spectacles	1146	" This big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks - by God , he never saw me at all ! "
38034	38039	38040	38040	he	1146	" How was that ? "
38043	38051	38040	38040	he	1146	" I thought you talked to him . "
38052	38057	38059	38059	Bull	135	" So I did , "
38062	38085	38059	38059	Bull	135	" but we talked in a pitch - dark room like a coalcellar . There , you would never have guessed that . "
38086	38094	38096	38096	Syme	116	" I could not have conceived it , "
38099	38107	38109	38110	the Professor	798	" It is indeed a new idea , "
38180	38186	38187	38187	he	798	" I had already arranged , "
38190	38324	38187	38187	he	798	" to go to France for my lunch ; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me . You see , I had to send that beast , the Marquis , over with his bomb , because the President had his eye on me , though God knows how . I 'll tell you the story some day . It was perfectly choking . Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere , smiling out of the bow - window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus . I tell you , you can say what you like , that fellow sold himself to the devil ; he can be in six places at once . "
38325	38336	38338	38339	the Professor	798	" So you sent the Marquis off , I understand , "
38341	38356	38338	38339	the Professor	798	" Was it long ago ? Shall we be in time to catch him ? "
38357	38360	38362	38364	the new guide	1156	" Yes , "
38366	38383	38362	38364	the new guide	1156	" I 've timed it all . He 'll still be at Calais when we arrive . "
38384	38394	38396	38397	the Professor	798	" But when we do catch him at Calais , "
38399	38407	38396	38397	the Professor	798	" what are we going to do ? "
38431	38444	38422	38422	He	135	" Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police . "
38445	38449	38451	38451	Syme	116	" Not I , "
38453	38516	38451	38451	Syme	116	" Theoretically I ought to drown myself first . I promised a poor fellow , who was a real modern pessimist , on my word of honour not to tell the police . I 'm no hand at casuistry , but I ca n't break my word to a modern pessimist . It 's like breaking one 's word to a child . "
38517	38525	38527	38528	the Professor	798	" I 'm in the same boat , "
38530	38595	38527	38528	the Professor	798	" I tried to tell the police and I could n't , because of some silly oath I took . You see , when I was an actor I was a sort of all - round beast . Perjury or treason is the only crime I have n't committed . If I did that I should n't know the difference between right and wrong . "
38596	38604	38606	38607	Dr. Bull	135	" I 've been through all that , "
38609	38729	38606	38607	Dr. Bull	135	" and I 've made up my mind . I gave my promise to the Secretary - you know him , man who smiles upside down . My friends , that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human . It may be his digestion , or his conscience , or his nerves , or his philosophy of the universe , but he 's damned , he 's in hell ! Well , I ca n't turn on a man like that , and hunt him down . It 's like whipping a leper . I may be mad , but that 's how I feel ; and there 's jolly well the end of it . "
38730	38739	38741	38741	Syme	116	" I do n't think you 're mad , "
38743	38755	38741	38741	Syme	116	" I knew you would decide like that when first you - "
38756	38759	38761	38762	Dr. Bull	135	" Eh ? "
38764	38773	38606	38607	Dr. Bull	135	" When first you took off your spectacles . "
38813	38816	38818	38818	Syme	116	" Well , "
38820	38847	38818	38818	Syme	116	" it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality , so we had better face the fact that comes of it . "
38848	38851	38853	38854	the Professor	798	" Yes , "
38856	38880	38853	38854	the Professor	798	" you 're quite right ; and we must hurry up , for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France . "
38881	38889	38891	38891	Syme	116	" The fact that comes of it , "
38894	38971	38891	38891	Syme	116	" is this , that we three are alone on this planet . Gogol has gone , God knows where ; perhaps the President has smashed him like a fly . On the Council we are three men against three , like the Romans who held the bridge . But we are worse off than that , first because they can appeal to their organization and we can not appeal to ours , and second because - "
38972	38981	38983	38984	the Professor	798	" Because one of those other three men , "
38986	38992	38983	38984	the Professor	798	" is not a man . "
39008	39220	39005	39005	he	116	" My idea is this . We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till tomorrow midday . I have turned over twenty schemes in my head . We can not denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed . We can not get him detained on some trivial charge , for we should have to appear ; he knows us , and he would smell a rat . We can not pretend to keep him on anarchist business ; he might swallow much in that way , but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went safely through Paris . We might try to kidnap him , and lock him up ourselves ; but he is a well - known man here . He has a whole bodyguard of friends ; he is very strong and brave , and the event is doubtful . The only thing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the Marquis 's favour . I am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman . I am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society . "
39221	39230	39232	39233	the Professor	798	" What the devil are you talking about ? "
39235	39246	39248	39248	Syme	116	" The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century , "
39250	39274	39248	39248	Syme	116	" but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn . Since 1350 the tree is quite clear . "
39275	39283	39285	39287	the little Doctor	2802	" He 's gone off his head , "
39291	39295	39297	39297	Syme	116	" Our bearings , "
39300	39321	39297	39297	Syme	116	" are ' argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field . ' The motto varies . "
39331	39337	39338	39338	he	798	" We are just inshore , "
39341	39352	39338	39338	he	798	" Are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ? "
39353	39361	39363	39363	Syme	116	" My remarks are almost painfully practical , "
39370	39438	39363	39363	Syme	116	" The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient . The Marquis can not deny that he is a gentleman . He can not deny that I am a gentleman . And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off . But here we are in the harbour . "
39730	39809	39698	39698	He	116	" I shall approach . Before taking off his hat , I shall take off my own . I shall say , ' The Marquis de Saint Eustache , I believe . ' He will say , ' The celebrated Mr. Syme , I presume . ' He will say in the most exquisite French , ' How are you ? ' I shall reply in the most exquisite Cockney , ' Oh , just the Syme - ' "
39810	39816	39818	39821	the man in spectacles	1146	" Oh , shut it , "
39823	39844	39818	39821	the man in spectacles	1146	" Pull yourself together , and chuck away that bit of paper . What are you really going to do ? "
39845	39853	39855	39855	Syme	92	" But it was a lovely catechism , "
39858	39896	39855	39855	Syme	92	" Do let me read it you . It has only forty - three questions and answers , and some of the Marquis 's answers are wonderfully witty . I like to be just to my enemy . "
39897	39907	39909	39910	Dr. Bull	135	" But what 's the good of it all ? "
39914	39927	39929	39929	Syme	92	" It leads up to my challenge , do n't you see , "
39933	39948	39929	39929	Syme	92	" When the Marquis has given the thirty - ninth reply , which runs - "
39949	39959	39961	39962	the Professor	798	" Has it by any chance occurred to you , "
39969	40005	39961	39962	the Professor	798	" that the Marquis may not say all the forty - three things you have put down for him ? In that case , I understand , your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced . "
40015	40023	40024	40024	he	92	" Why , how true that is , "
40027	40051	40024	40024	he	92	" and I never thought of it . Sir , you have an intellect beyond the common . You will make a name . "
40052	40063	40065	40066	the Doctor	1089	" Oh , you 're as drunk as an owl ! "
40068	40073	40075	40075	Syme	92	" It only remains , "
40079	40169	40075	40075	Syme	92	" to adopt some other method of breaking the ice if I may so express it between myself and the man I wish to kill . And since the course of a dialogue can not be predicted by one of its parties alone as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen , the only thing to be done , I suppose , is for the one party , as far as possible , to do all the dialogue by himself . And so I will , by George ! "
40435	40444	40446	40447	the Professor	798	" Are you going to address the meeting ? "
40468	40472	40473	40473	he	92	" I am , "
40485	40510	40473	40473	he	92	" that meeting . That meeting displeases me . I am going to pull that meeting 's great ugly , mahogany - coloured nose . "
40539	40548	40549	40549	he	740	" You are Mr. Syme , I think , "
40555	40565	40566	40566	he	92	" And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache , "
40570	40578	40566	40566	he	92	" Permit me to pull your nose . "
40610	40617	40619	40619	Syme	92	" This man has insulted me ! "
40626	40630	40632	40637	the gentleman with the red rosette	1207	" Insulted you ? "
40639	40642	40632	40637	the gentleman with the red rosette	1207	" when ? "
40643	40649	40651	40651	Syme	92	" Oh , just now , "
40654	40660	40651	40651	Syme	92	" He insulted my mother . "
40661	40666	40668	40669	the gentleman	1208	" Insulted your mother ! "
40672	40677	40679	40679	Syme	92	" Well , anyhow , "
40685	40689	40679	40679	Syme	92	" my aunt . "
40690	40703	40705	40707	the second gentleman	1209	" But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ? "
40713	40723	40705	40707	the second gentleman	1209	" He has been sitting here all the time . "
40724	40733	40735	40735	Syme	92	" Ah , it was what he said ! "
40738	40745	40747	40748	the Marquis	740	" I said nothing at all , "
40750	40767	40747	40748	the Marquis	740	" except something about the band . I only said that I liked Wagner played well . "
40768	40777	40779	40779	Syme	92	" It was an allusion to my family , "
40782	40803	40779	40779	Syme	92	" My aunt played Wagner badly . It was a painful subject . We are always being insulted about it . "
40804	40810	40812	40816	the gentleman who was decore	1211	" This seems most extraordinary , "
40824	40831	40833	40833	Syme	92	" Oh , I assure you , "
40836	40854	40833	40833	Syme	92	" the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt 's weaknesses . "
40855	40860	40862	40864	the second gentleman	1209	" This is nonsense ! "
40866	40890	40862	40864	the second gentleman	1209	" I for one have said nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black hair . "
40891	40899	40901	40901	Syme	92	" Well , there you are again ! "
40904	40911	40901	40901	Syme	92	" My aunt 's was red . "
40912	40918	40920	40921	the other	310	" It seems to me , "
40923	40936	40920	40921	the other	310	" that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis . "
40937	40941	40943	40943	Syme	92	" By George ! "
40952	40960	40943	40943	Syme	92	" what a clever chap you are ! "
40973	40980	40981	40981	he	740	" Seeking a quarrel with me ! "
40984	41027	40981	40981	he	740	" Seeking a fight with me ! By God ! there was never a man who had to seek long . These gentlemen will perhaps act for me . There are still four hours of daylight . Let us fight this evening . "
41036	41039	41040	41040	he	92	" Marquis , "
41043	41072	41040	41040	he	92	" your action is worthy of your fame and blood . Permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place myself . "
41137	41143	41144	41144	he	92	" I have done it , "
41148	41351	41144	41144	he	92	" I have fixed a fight on the beast . But look here , and listen carefully . There is no time for talk . You are my seconds , and everything must come from you . Now you must insist , and insist absolutely , on the duel coming off after seven to - morrow , so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7.45 for Paris . If he misses that he misses his crime . He ca n't refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place . But this is what he will do . He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station , where he can pick up the train . He is a very good swordsman , and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it . But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost . Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings . You understand ? Very well then , let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine , "
41958	41976	41978	41979	the Professor	798	" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St. Eustache , "
41982	42030	41978	41979	the Professor	798	" it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can - "
42031	42034	42037	42038	the Marquis	740	" Peste ! "
42047	42055	42057	42057	he	740	" let us stop talking and begin , "
42248	42251	42243	42244	The Colonel	1254	" Engage ! "
43400	43404	43405	43405	he	92	" After all , "
43410	43440	43405	43405	he	92	" I am more than a devil ; I am a man . I can do the one thing which Satan himself can not do - I can die , "
43609	43612	43614	43615	the Marquis	740	" Stop ! "
43625	43632	43614	43615	the Marquis	740	" I want to say something . "
43633	43639	43641	43642	Colonel Ducroix	162	" What is the matter ? "
43646	43653	43641	43642	Colonel Ducroix	162	" Has there been foul play ? "
43654	43662	43664	43665	Dr. Bull	135	" There has been foul play somewhere , "
43673	43692	43664	43665	Dr. Bull	135	" Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least , and he is none the worse . "
43707	43713	43714	43714	he	740	" Please let me speak , "
43717	43726	43727	43727	he	740	" It is rather important . Mr. Syme , "
43735	43783	43727	43727	he	740	" we are fighting to - day , if I remember right , because you expressed a wish which I thought irrational to pull my nose . Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ? I have to catch a train . "
43784	43793	43795	43796	Dr. Bull	135	" I protest that this is most irregular , "
43799	43808	43810	43811	Colonel Ducroix	162	" It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent , "
43819	43868	43810	43811	Colonel Ducroix	162	" There is , I think , one case on record Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants . But one can hardly call one 's nose a weapon . "
43869	43880	43882	43883	the Marquis	740	" Will you or will you not pull my nose ? "
43887	43934	43936	43936	he	740	" Come , come , Mr. Syme ! You wanted to do it , do it ! You can have no conception of how important it is to me . Do n't be so selfish ! Pull my nose at once , when I ask you ! "
44082	44093	44094	44094	he	740	" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow , "
44097	44126	44128	44128	he	740	" he can have it . Colonel Ducroix , do accept my left eyebrow ! It 's the kind of thing that might come in useful any day , "
44164	44170	44171	44171	he	740	" If I had known , "
44174	44188	44171	44171	he	740	" that I was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight - "
44189	44198	44200	44201	the Marquis	740	" Oh , I know , I know ! "
44216	44243	44200	44201	the Marquis	740	" You are making a mistake ; but it ca n't be explained just now . I tell you the train has come into the station ! "
44244	44247	44249	44250	Dr. Bull	135	" Yes , "
44253	44281	44249	44250	Dr. Bull	135	" and the train shall go out of the station . It shall go out without you . We know well enough for what devil 's work - "
44321	44328	44329	44329	he	740	" Will you drive me mad ? "
44332	44336	44329	44329	he	740	" The train - "
44337	44346	44348	44348	Syme	92	" You shall not go by the train , "
44376	44400	44401	44401	he	92	" You great fat , blasted , blear - eyed , blundering , thundering , brainless , Godforsaken , doddering , damned fool ! "
44407	44421	44401	44401	he	92	" You great silly , pink - faced , towheaded turnip ! You - "
44422	44431	44433	44433	Syme	92	" You shall not go by this train , "
44435	44442	44444	44445	the other	310	" And why the infernal blazes , "
44457	44457	44444	44445	the other	310	"
44458	44463	44465	44466	the Professor	798	" We know all , "
44469	44480	44465	44466	the Professor	798	" You are going to Paris to throw a bomb ! "
44481	44490	44492	44493	the other	310	" Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock ! "
44504	44547	44465	44466	the Professor	798	" Have you all got softening of the brain , that you do n't realise what I am ? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train ? Twenty Paris trains might go by for me . Damn Paris trains ! "
44548	44556	44558	44559	the Professor	798	" Then what did you care about ? "
44561	44597	44558	44559	the Professor	798	" What did I care about ? I did n't care about catching the train ; I cared about whether the train caught me , and now , by God ! it has caught me . "
44598	44605	44607	44607	Syme	92	" I regret to inform you , "
44611	44689	44607	44607	Syme	92	" that your remarks convey no impression to my mind . Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin , your meaning would become clearer . Mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways . What do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ? It may be my literary fancy , but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something . "
44690	44695	44697	44698	the other	310	" It means everything , "
44700	44718	44697	44698	the other	310	" and the end of everything . Sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand . "
44719	44722	44724	44725	the Professor	798	" Us ! "
44731	44741	44724	44725	the Professor	798	" What do you mean by ' us ' ? "
44742	44749	44751	44752	the Marquis	740	" The police , of course ! "
44794	44800	44801	44801	he	740	" I am Inspector Ratcliffe , "
44814	44851	44853	44853	he	740	" My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them . But if there is any doubt about my position , I have a card "
44871	44880	44881	44881	he	798	" Oh , do n't show it us , "
44885	44899	44881	44881	he	798	" we 've got enough of them to equip a paper - chase . "
44964	44967	44968	44968	he	1344	" Gentlemen , "
44971	45134	44968	44968	he	1344	" we all owe you a serious apology ; but I assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine , or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour . You have not wasted your time ; you have helped to save the world . We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy . A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin . How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . "
45156	45261	45142	45148	a short man with a black moustache	1348	" Of course , I accept the apology ; but you will in your turn forgive me if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties , and permit myself to say good morning ! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow - townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day . Colonel Ducroix , I would in no way influence your actions , but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal , I am now going to walk back to the town . "
45279	45331	45262	45263	Colonel Ducroix	162	" No , by George ! I wo n't . If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I 'll see them through it . I have fought for France , and it is hard if I ca n't fight for civilization . "
45349	45357	45359	45360	Inspector Ratcliffe	168	" Do n't make too much noise , "
45362	45368	45359	45360	Inspector Ratcliffe	168	" Sunday may hear you . "
45369	45372	45374	45374	Bull	135	" Sunday ! "
45381	45384	45386	45386	Ratcliffe	168	" Yes , "
45388	45395	45386	45386	Ratcliffe	168	" he may be with them . "
45396	45400	45402	45402	Syme	92	" With whom ? "
45404	45413	45415	45416	the other	310	" With the people out of that train , "
45418	45426	45428	45428	Syme	92	" What you say seems utterly wild , "
45430	45444	45445	45445	he	135	" Why , as a matter of fact - But , my God , "
45462	45503	45445	45445	he	135	" by God ! if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy ! Every born man was a detective except the President and his personal secretary . What can it mean ? "
45504	45507	45509	45514	the new policeman with incredible violence	1351	" Mean ! "
45516	45615	45617	45617	he	1351	" It means that we are struck dead ! Do n't you know Sunday ? Do n't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ? I tell you he has bought every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line - especially of that railway line ! "
45628	45754	45617	45617	he	1351	" The whole movement was controlled by him ; half the world was ready to rise for him . But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him . . . and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council , to waste their time in watching each other . Idiots that we are , he planned the whole of our idiocies ! Sunday knew that the Professor would chase Syme through London , and that Syme would fight me in France . And he was combining great masses of capital , and seizing great lines of telegraphy , while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man 's buff . "
45755	45758	45760	45760	Syme	92	" Well ? "
45767	45770	45772	45773	the other	310	" Well , "
45778	45865	45772	45773	the other	310	" he has found us playing blind man 's buff to - day in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude . He has probably captured the world ; it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it . And since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train , I will tell you . My objection was that Sunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it . "
45915	45928	45930	45932	the new policeman	1357	" It was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache , "
45939	46009	45930	45932	the new policeman	1357	" always to carry a pair of opera glasses . Either the President or the Secretary is coming after us with that mob . They have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police . Dr. Bull , I have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles . "
46034	46045	46047	46048	the Professor	798	" It can not be as bad as you say , "
46053	46071	46047	46048	the Professor	798	" There are a good number of them certainly , but they may easily be ordinary tourists . "
46072	46077	46079	46079	Bull	135	" Do ordinary tourists , "
46088	46099	46079	46079	Bull	135	" wear black masks half - way down the face ? "
46226	46236	46237	46237	he	135	" The President is not with them , anyhow , "
46245	46256	46258	46260	the bewildered Colonel	1365	" But surely they are right away on the horizon , "
46275	46287	46258	46260	the bewildered Colonel	1365	" Could you possibly know your President among all those people ? "
46288	46300	46302	46302	Syme	169	" Could I know a white elephant among all those people ! "
46306	46339	46302	46302	Syme	169	" As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them . . . by God ! I believe this ground would shake . "
46355	46395	46349	46349	Ratcliffe	168	" Of course the President is n't with them . I wish to Gemini he were . Much more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris , or sitting on the ruins of St. Paul 's Cathedral . "
46396	46401	46403	46403	Syme	169	" This is absurd ! "
46405	46433	46434	46434	he	169	" Something may have happened in our absence ; but he can not have carried the world with a rush like that . It is quite true , "
46450	46478	46434	46434	he	169	" it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out . "
46479	46484	46486	46488	the new detective	1369	" Oh , they , "
46491	46568	46570	46570	he	1369	" no they are not a very valuable force . But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value - we are not much , my boy , in Sunday 's universe . He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself . But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter , like a post card ; it may be left to his private secretary , "
46587	46619	46577	46577	he	1369	" There is a great deal to be said for death ; but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative , I strongly advise him to walk after me . "
47246	47251	47252	47252	he	92	" May I ask , "
47255	47265	47252	47252	he	92	" where on earth we are all going to ? "
47293	47307	47308	47308	he	92	" We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea , "
47311	47327	47308	47308	he	92	" I think that part of the country is least likely to be with them . "
47328	47337	47339	47339	Syme	92	" What can you mean by all this ? "
47341	47378	47339	47339	Syme	92	" They ca n't be running the real world in that way . Surely not many working men are anarchists , and surely if they were , mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police . "
47379	47383	47385	47387	his new friend	1407	" Mere mobs ! "
47394	47524	47385	47387	his new friend	1407	" So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question . You 've got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor . Why should it ? The poor have been rebels , but they have never been anarchists ; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government . The poor man really has a stake in the country . The rich man has n't ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht . The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all . Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ' wars . "
47525	47537	47539	47539	Syme	92	" As a lecture on English history for the little ones , "
47541	47557	47539	47539	Syme	92	" this is all very nice ; but I have not yet grasped its application . "
47558	47563	47565	47566	his informant	1408	" Its application is , "
47568	47621	47565	47566	his informant	1408	" that most of old Sunday 's right - hand men are South African and American millionaires . That is why he has got hold of all the communications ; and that is why the last four champions of the anti - anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits . "
47622	47628	47630	47630	Syme	92	" Millionaires I can understand , "
47633	47692	47630	47630	Syme	92	" they are nearly all mad . But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing ; getting hold of great Christian nations is another . I would bet the nose off my face forgive the allusion that Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere . "
47693	47696	47698	47699	the other	310	" Well , "
47701	47712	47698	47699	the other	310	" it rather depends what sort of person you mean . "
47713	47719	47721	47721	Syme	92	" Well , for instance , "
47723	47731	47733	47733	he	92	" he could never convert that person , "
47912	47918	47921	47921	Ratcliffe	168	" Mr. Syme is saying , "
47927	47941	47921	47921	Ratcliffe	168	" that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist . "
47942	47950	47952	47953	Colonel Ducroix	162	" Mr. Syme is right enough there , "
47957	47988	47952	47953	Colonel Ducroix	162	" if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend . But I forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy . "
47989	47994	47996	47997	Dr. Bull	135	" He looks poor , "
48000	48004	48006	48007	the Colonel	1254	" Quite so , "
48009	48017	48006	48007	the Colonel	1254	" that is why he is rich . "
48018	48024	48027	48028	Dr. Bull	135	" I have an idea , "
48031	48061	48027	48028	Dr. Bull	135	" how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ? Those dogs are all on foot , and we could soon leave them behind . "
48062	48069	48071	48071	Syme	92	" Oh , give him anything ! "
48074	48083	48071	48071	Syme	92	" I have piles of money on me . "
48084	48090	48092	48093	the Colonel	1254	" That will never do , "
48095	48110	48092	48093	the Colonel	1254	" he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain . "
48111	48118	48120	48120	Bull	135	" Oh , if he haggles ! "
48123	48133	48135	48136	the other	310	" Erie haggles because he is a free man , "
48138	48159	48135	48136	the other	310	" You do not understand ; he would not see the meaning of generosity . He is not being tipped . "
48614	48617	48619	48620	the policeman	473	" Yes , "
48622	48694	48619	48620	the policeman	473	" that 's discipline . That 's Sunday . He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God . Yes , they are walking regularly ; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly , yes , and thinking regularly . But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly . "
48894	48899	48900	48901	The peasant	1458	" Le Soleil d'Or . "
49106	49114	49115	49115	he	1254	" May I ask you , Colonel , "
49122	49129	49115	49115	he	1254	" why we have come here ? "
49139	49146	49147	49147	he	1254	" For two reasons , sir , "
49150	49186	49147	49147	he	1254	" and I will give first , not the most important , but the most utilitarian . We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses . "
49187	49190	49192	49192	Syme	92	" Horses ! "
49198	49201	49203	49204	the other	310	" Yes , "
49206	49238	49203	49204	the other	310	" if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you , unless of course you have bicycles and motor - cars in your pocket . "
49239	49250	49252	49252	Syme	92	" And where do you advise us to make for ? "
49255	49259	49261	49262	the Colonel	1254	" Beyond question , "
49264	49323	49261	49262	the Colonel	1254	" you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town . My friend , whom I seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances , seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising ; but even he would hardly maintain , I suppose , that you were not safe with the gendarmes . "
49333	49342	49329	49329	he	92	" And your other reason for coming here ? "
49343	49351	49353	49353	Ducroix	162	" My other reason for coming here , "
49356	49379	49353	49353	Ducroix	162	" is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death . "
49402	49407	49399	49399	he	92	" You are right , "
49414	49422	49399	49399	he	92	" Has anyone seen about the horses ? "
49423	49426	49428	49428	Ducroix	162	" Yes , "
49430	49491	49428	49428	Ducroix	162	" you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in . Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry , but they were really moving wonderfully fast , like a well - trained army . I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline . You have not a moment to waste . "
49892	49904	49905	49905	he	1254	" Four out of the five rich men in this town , "
49908	49958	49905	49905	he	1254	" are common swindlers . I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world . The fifth is a friend of mine , and a very fine fellow ; and what is even more important from our point of view , he owns a motor - car . "
49959	49964	49966	49967	the Professor	798	" I am afraid , "
49992	50004	49969	49969	his	798	" I am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls . "
50005	50016	50018	50019	the Colonel	1254	" Doctor Renard 's house is only three minutes off , "
50021	50025	50027	50028	Dr. Bull	135	" Our danger , "
50030	50037	50027	50028	Dr. Bull	135	" is not two minutes off . "
50038	50041	50043	50043	Syme	92	" Yes , "
50045	50063	50043	50043	Syme	92	" if we ride on fast we must leave them behind , for they are on foot . "
50064	50072	50074	50075	the Colonel	1254	" He has a motor - car , "
50077	50085	50087	50087	Bull	135	" But we may not get it , "
50089	50099	50043	50043	Syme	92	" Yes , he is quite on your side . "
50100	50107	50043	50043	Syme	92	" But he might be out . "
50108	50113	50115	50115	Syme	92	" Hold your tongue , "
50118	50124	50115	50115	Syme	92	" What is that noise ? "
50207	50213	50214	50214	he	1254	" They have done us , "
50222	50228	50214	50214	he	1254	" Prepare to receive cavalry ! "
50229	50238	50240	50240	Syme	92	" Where can they have got the horses ? "
50268	50297	50261	50261	he	1254	" I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ' Soleil d'Or ' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles . "
50298	50301	50303	50303	Syme	92	" No ! "
50306	50323	50303	50303	Syme	92	" I do n't believe he 'd do it . Not with all that white hair . "
50324	50331	50333	50334	the Colonel	1254	" He may have been forced , "
50337	50367	50333	50334	the Colonel	1254	" They must be at least a hundred strong , for which reason we are all going to see my friend Renard , who has a motor - car . "
50560	50563	50564	50564	he	174	" Anarchy , "
50571	50576	50564	50564	he	174	" it is childishness ! "
50577	50581	50584	50585	the Colonel	1254	" Et ca , "
50595	50605	50584	50585	the Colonel	1254	" and that is childishness , is n't it ? "
50785	50796	50798	50799	the Colonel	1254	" I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion , "
50801	50817	50798	50799	the Colonel	1254	" but can you lend me your motor - car now , in two minutes ? "
50818	50829	50831	50832	Dr. Renard	174	" I have a suspicion that you are all mad , "
50837	50858	50831	50832	Dr. Renard	174	" but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship . Let us go round to the garage . "
51023	51030	51032	51033	Dr. Bull	135	" It is now or never , "
51035	51040	51032	51033	Dr. Bull	135	" I hear horses . "
51041	51044	51046	51047	the Professor	798	" No , "
51049	51053	51046	51047	the Professor	798	" a horse . "
51166	51175	51152	51152	He	92	" I am afraid it 's no go . "
51374	51386	51388	51389	the Professor	798	" I ca n't understand why it has grown so dark , "
51397	51407	51409	51410	Dr. Bull	135	" Going to be a storm , I think , "
51412	51436	51409	51410	Dr. Bull	135	" I say , it 's a pity we have n't got a light on this car , if only to see by . "
51437	51441	51443	51444	the Colonel	1254	" We have , "
51511	51520	51522	51523	the Professor	798	" Where on earth did you get that ? "
51525	51535	51537	51538	the Colonel	1254	" I got it where I got the car , "
51542	51703	51537	51538	the Colonel	1254	" from my best friend . While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to Renard , who was standing in his own porch , you will remember . ' I suppose , ' I said , ' there 's no time to get a lamp . ' He looked up , blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall . From this was suspended , by chains of exquisite ironwork , this lantern , one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house . By sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling , shattering the painted panels , and bringing down two blue vases with his violence . Then he handed me the iron lantern , and I put it in the car . Was I not right when I said that Dr. Renard was worth knowing ? "
51704	51708	51710	51710	Syme	92	" You were , "
51831	51840	51822	51822	himself	135	" These lights make one feel more cheerful . "
51848	51862	51863	51863	he	168	" There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful , "
51866	51894	51863	51863	he	168	" and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town . Please God we may be there in ten minutes . "
51910	51919	51920	51920	he	135	" Oh , this is all raving nonsense ! "
51923	51962	51920	51920	he	135	" If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists , you must be madder than an anarchist yourself . If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us . "
51963	51966	51968	51969	the other	310	" No , "
51975	51988	51968	51969	the other	310	" the whole town would fight for them . We shall see . '
52002	52008	52009	52009	he	798	" What is that noise ? "
52012	52023	52025	52026	the Colonel	1254	" Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose , "
52028	52038	52025	52026	the Colonel	1254	" I thought we had got clear of them . "
52039	52047	52049	52050	the Professor	798	" The horses behind us ! No , "
52052	52065	52049	52050	the Professor	798	" it is not horses , and it is not behind us . "
52132	52140	52141	52141	he	798	" I tell you they were his , "
52148	52158	52141	52141	he	798	" and they were full of men in masks ! "
52159	52162	52164	52165	the Colonel	1254	" Absurd ! "
52168	52178	52164	52165	the Colonel	1254	" Dr. Renard would never give them his cars . "
52179	52186	52188	52188	Ratcliffe	168	" He may have been forced , "
52191	52200	52188	52188	Ratcliffe	168	" The whole town is on their side . "
52201	52207	52209	52210	the Colonel	1254	" You still believe that , "
52213	52221	52223	52224	the other	310	" You will all believe it soon , "
52248	52271	52242	52243	the Colonel	1254	" No , I ca n't believe it . The thing is nonsense . The plain people of a peaceable French town - "
52319	52323	52325	52326	the Colonel	1254	" My God ! "
52335	52335	52325	52326	the Colonel	1254	"
52336	52343	52345	52347	the gloomy Ratcliffe	168	" It need not interrupt conversation , "
52349	52374	52345	52347	the gloomy Ratcliffe	168	" Pray resume your remarks , Colonel . You were talking , I think , about the plain people of a peaceable French town . "
52393	52398	52399	52399	he	1254	" It is extraordinary , "
52402	52406	52399	52399	he	1254	" most extraordinary . "
52407	52412	52414	52414	Syme	92	" A fastidious person , "
52416	52446	52414	52414	Syme	92	" might even call it unpleasant . However , I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie . We shall soon get there . "
52447	52450	52452	52453	Inspector Ratcliffe	168	" No , "
52455	52462	52452	52453	Inspector Ratcliffe	168	" we shall never get there . "
52489	52495	52497	52497	Bull	135	" What do you mean ? "
52500	52510	52512	52513	the pessimist	1633	" I mean that we shall never get there , "
52516	52547	52512	52513	the pessimist	1633	" They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here . The town is in arms , as I said it was .
52561	52561	52548	52548	I	0	"
52739	52763	52722	52728	Syme , whose eyes were the keenest	1648	" It is quite true . There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street . "
52764	52771	52773	52773	Bull	135	" Well , if there is , "
52776	52833	52773	52773	Bull	135	" it must be something else - a sham fight or the mayor 's birthday or something . I can not and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets . Get on a bit , Syme , and let us look at them . "
52860	52867	52868	52868	he	135	" Why , you silly mugs ! "
52871	52901	52868	52868	he	135	" what did I tell you . That crowd 's as law - abiding as a cow , and if it were n't , it 's on our side . "
52902	52908	52910	52911	the professor	798	" How do you know ? "
52915	52920	52922	52922	Bull	135	" You blind bat , "
52924	52934	52922	52922	Bull	135	" do n't you see who is leading them ? "
52954	52961	52948	52948	his	1254	" Why , it 's Renard ! "
53028	53036	53038	53039	the Colonel	1254	" What a fool I 've been ! "
53041	53056	53038	53039	the Colonel	1254	" Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us . "
53093	53100	53077	53077	He	135	" Dr. Renard ! Dr. Renard ! "
53242	53245	53247	53249	the cigarette smoker	1660	" Well , "
53252	53259	53247	53249	the cigarette smoker	1660	" what do you think now ? "
53260	53264	53266	53267	Dr. Bull	135	" I think , "
53271	53419	53266	53267	Dr. Bull	135	" that I am lying in bed at No . 217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that 's not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor ca n't make much of my case . But if you want to know what I do n't think , I 'll tell you . I do n't think what you think . I do n't think , and I never shall think , that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers . No , sir , I 'm a democrat , and I still do n't believe that Sunday could convert one average navvy or counter - jumper . No , I may be mad , but humanity is n't . "
53439	53447	53448	53448	he	92	" You are a very fine fellow , "
53451	53527	53448	53448	he	92	" You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity . And you 're right enough about humanity , about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper . But you 're not right about Renard . I suspected him from the first . He 's rationalistic , and , what 's worse , he 's rich . When duty and religion are really destroyed , it will be by the rich . "
53528	53535	53537	53541	the man with a cigarette	1661	" They are really destroyed now , "
53552	53559	53546	53546	his	1661	" The devils are coming on ! "
53621	53624	53625	53625	he	1254	" Gentlemen , "
53628	53670	53625	53625	he	1254	" the thing is incredible . It must be a practical joke . If you knew Renard as I do - it 's like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter . If you had got the man 's character into your head - "
53671	53675	53677	53677	Syme	92	" Dr. Bull , "
53680	53690	53677	53677	Syme	92	" has at least got it into his hat . "
53691	53700	53702	53703	the Colonel	1254	" I tell you it ca n't be ! "
53707	53720	53722	53722	he	1254	" Renard shall explain it . He shall explain it to me , "
53726	53735	53737	53738	the smoker	1669	" Do n't be in such a hurry , "
53740	53752	53737	53738	the smoker	1669	" He will very soon explain it to all of us . "
53800	53806	53808	53808	Syme	92	" It is no good , "
53810	53859	53808	53808	Syme	92	" He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through Bull 's hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them . "
53860	53868	53870	53871	Dr. Bull	135	" I wo n't ' ave it , "
53883	53899	53870	53871	Dr. Bull	135	" The poor chaps may be making a mistake . Give the Colonel a chance . "
53900	53908	53910	53911	the Professor	798	" Shall we go back , then ? "
53913	53916	53918	53918	Ratcliffe	168	" No , "
53924	53948	53918	53918	Ratcliffe	168	" the street behind us is held too . In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme . "
54046	54053	54055	54056	the Professor	798	" What the devil is up ? "
54062	54069	54071	54071	Syme	92	" The morning star has fallen ! "
54138	54144	54146	54147	the Professor	798	" The world is insane ! "
54157	54160	54162	54163	Dr. Bull	135	" No , "
54168	54172	54162	54163	Dr. Bull	135	" it is I. "
54173	54181	54183	54184	the Professor	798	" What are we going to do ? "
54186	54191	54193	54193	Syme	92	" At this moment , "
54200	54212	54193	54193	Syme	92	" I think we are going to smash into a lamppost . "
54279	54286	54288	54289	the Professor	798	" Well , we smashed something , "
54296	54302	54288	54289	the Professor	798	" That 's some comfort . "
54303	54310	54312	54312	Syme	92	" You 're becoming an anarchist , "
54323	54327	54329	54329	Ratcliffe	168	" Everyone is , "
54440	54447	54449	54449	Syme	92	" We have one more chance , "
54459	54531	54449	54449	Syme	92	" Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We ca n't get there , for they hold the way . But there 's a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here , which we could defend longer than anything else , like Horatius and his bridge . We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out . Keep after me . "
54821	54825	54827	54827	Syme	92	" The peasant ! "
54829	54839	54827	54827	Syme	92	" They have not risen since the Middle Ages . "
54840	54849	54851	54852	the Professor	798	" Even if the police do come now , "
54855	54864	54851	54852	the Professor	798	" they can do nothing with this mob . "
54865	54868	54870	54870	Bull	135	" Nonsence ! "
54873	54887	54870	54870	Bull	135	" there must be some people left in the town who are human . "
54888	54891	54893	54895	the hopeless Inspector	1722	" No , "
54897	54913	54893	54895	the hopeless Inspector	1722	" the human being will soon be extinct . We are the last of mankind . "
54914	54919	54921	54922	the Professor	798	" It may be , "
54933	54946	54926	54926	he	798	" What is all that at the end of the ' Dunciad ' ?
55003	55004	54986	54986	Thy	1724	" '
55005	55008	55010	55010	Bull	135	" Stop ! "
55013	55019	55010	55010	Bull	135	" the gendarmes are out . "
55058	55065	55052	55052	They	1727	" cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm .
55066	55069	55071	55071	Syme	92	" No , "
55073	55081	55071	55071	Syme	92	" they are formed along the parade . "
55082	55089	55091	55091	Bull	135	" They have unslung their carbines , "
55096	55099	55101	55101	Ratcliffe	168	" Yes , "
55103	55113	55101	55101	Ratcliffe	168	" and they are going to fire on us . "
55147	55156	55115	55115	he	168	" cried the Professor , and struck his forehead .
55157	55165	55167	55167	Bull	135	" I am in the padded cell , "
55195	55215	55178	55178	Ratcliffe	168	" What does it matter who is mad or who is sane ? We shall all be dead soon . "
55223	55231	55216	55216	Syme	92	" You are quite hopeless , then ? "
55246	55299	55242	55242	he	168	" No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless . There is one insane little hope that I can not get out of my mind . The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I can not help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet . "
55300	55309	55311	55311	Syme	92	" In what or whom is your hope ? "
55315	55323	55325	55326	the other	310	" In a man I never saw , "
55334	55341	55343	55343	Syme	92	" I know what you mean , "
55349	55366	55343	55343	Syme	92	" the man in the dark room . But Sunday must have killed him by now . "
55367	55370	55372	55373	the other	310	" Perhaps , "
55376	55394	55372	55373	the other	310	" but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill . "
55395	55402	55404	55405	the Professor	798	" I heard what you said , "
55412	55426	55404	55405	the Professor	798	" I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw . "
55456	55469	55450	55454	a man waking from sleep	1736	" Where is the Colonel ? I thought he was with us ! "
55470	55476	55478	55478	Bull	135	" The Colonel ! Yes , "
55480	55488	55478	55478	Bull	135	" where on earth is the Colonel ? "
55489	55497	55499	55500	the Professor	798	" He went to speak to Renard , "
55502	55513	55515	55515	Syme	92	" We can not leave him among all those beasts , "
55517	55525	55515	55515	Syme	92	" Let us die like gentlemen if - "
55526	55533	55535	55535	Ratcliffe	168	" Do not pity the Colonel , "
55542	55551	55535	55535	Ratcliffe	168	" He is extremely comfortable . He is - "
55552	55559	55561	55561	Syme	92	" No ! no ! no ! "
55568	55580	55561	55561	Syme	92	" not the Colonel too ! I will never believe it ! "
55581	55588	55590	55591	the other	310	" Will you believe your eyes ? "
55725	55733	55735	55736	the Professor	798	" Yes , he is gone too , "
55745	55777	55735	55736	the Professor	798	" Everything 's gone . I 'm gone ! I ca n't trust my own bodily machinery . I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me . "
55778	55785	55787	55787	Syme	92	" When my hand flies up , "
55789	55796	55798	55798	he	92	" it will strike somebody else , "
55875	55880	55881	55881	he	92	" Judas before Herod ! "
55940	55947	55949	55949	Syme	92	" Do you see this lantern ? "
55955	56095	55949	55949	Syme	92	" Do you see the cross carved on it , and the flame inside ? You did not make it . You did not light it , Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire . There is not a street you walk on , there is not a thread you wear , that was not made as this lantern was , by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats . You can make nothing . You can only destroy . You will destroy mankind ; you will destroy the world . Let that suffice you . Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy . It shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it . "
56137	56140	56142	56142	Syme	92	" Swords ! "
56155	56170	56142	56142	Syme	92	" Let us charge these dogs , for our time has come to die . "
56282	56288	56289	56289	he	698	" There is some mistake , "
56292	56314	56289	56289	he	698	" Mr. Syme , I hardly think you understand your position . I arrest you in the name of the law . "
56315	56320	56322	56322	Syme	92	" Of the law ? "
56329	56332	56334	56335	the Secretary	698	" Certainly ! "
56337	56346	56348	56348	he	698	" I am a detective from Scotland Yard , "
56358	56367	56369	56370	the Professor	798	" And what do you suppose we are ? "
56378	56381	56383	56384	the Secretary	698	" You , "
56387	56412	56383	56384	the Secretary	698	" are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council . Disguised as one of you , I - "
56422	56431	56432	56432	he	135	" There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council , "
56435	56478	56479	56479	he	135	" We were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other . And all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters . I knew I could n't be wrong about the mob , "
56498	56528	56479	56479	he	135	" Vulgar people are never mad . I 'm vulgar myself , and I know . I am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here . "
56740	56760	56761	56761	he	168	" I ca n't make head or tail of old Sunday 's little game any more than you can , "
56764	56787	56761	56761	he	168	" But whatever else Sunday is , he is n't a blameless citizen . Damn it ! do you remember his face ? "
56788	56793	56795	56795	Syme	92	" I grant you , "
56797	56808	56795	56795	Syme	92	" that I have never been able to forget it . "
56809	56812	56814	56815	the Secretary	698	" Well , "
56817	56842	56843	56843	he	168	" I suppose we can find out soon , for to - morrow we have our next general meeting . You will excuse me , "
56852	56862	56843	56843	he	168	" for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties . "
56863	56870	56872	56873	the Professor	798	" I suppose you are right , "
56876	56905	56872	56873	the Professor	798	" I suppose we might find it out from him ; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is . "
56906	56909	56911	56912	the Secretary	698	" Why , "
56914	56920	56911	56912	the Secretary	698	" for fear of bombs ? "
56921	56924	56926	56927	the Professor	798	" No , "
56929	56937	56926	56927	the Professor	798	" for fear he might tell me . "
56938	56945	56947	56948	Dr. Bull	135	" Let us have some drinks , "
57144	57153	57155	57156	Dr. Bull	135	" I tell you I 've seen him ! "
57162	57165	57167	57167	Syme	92	" Whom ? "
57170	57175	57167	57167	Syme	92	" Not the President ? "
57176	57183	57185	57186	Dr. Bull	135	" Not so bad as that , "
57192	57205	57185	57186	Dr. Bull	135	" not so bad as that . I 've got him here . "
57206	57211	57213	57213	Syme	92	" Got whom here ? "
57216	57220	57222	57223	the other	310	" Hairy man , "
57226	57241	57243	57243	he	135	" man that used to be hairy man - Gogol . Here he is , "
57285	57293	57294	57294	he	135	" Why do you worry with me ? "
57297	57306	57294	57294	he	135	" You have expelled me as a spy . "
57307	57313	57315	57315	Syme	92	" We are all spies ! "
57317	57323	57325	57326	Dr. Bull	135	" We 're all spies ! "
57328	57335	57325	57326	Dr. Bull	135	" Come and have a drink . "
57353	57359	57361	57362	Dr. Bull	135	" This is more cheerful , "
57364	57378	57361	57362	Dr. Bull	135	" we are six men going to ask one man what he means . "
57379	57390	57392	57392	Syme	92	" I think it is a bit queerer than that , "
57394	57410	57392	57392	Syme	92	" I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean . "
57551	57558	57560	57560	Syme	92	" My reason is quite simple , "
57562	57574	57560	57560	Syme	92	" I attack him rashly because I am afraid of him . "
57607	57610	57611	57611	he	135	" Delightful ! "
57614	57634	57611	57611	he	135	" So pleased to see you all . What an exquisite day it is . Is the Czar dead ? "
57652	57657	57658	57658	he	1814	" No , sir , "
57661	57678	57658	57658	he	1814	" there has been no massacre . I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles . "
57679	57683	57685	57686	the President	2559	" Disgusting spectacles ? "
57695	57703	57685	57686	the President	2559	" You mean Dr. Bull 's spectacles ? "
57723	57748	57712	57713	the President	2559	" Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself - "
57762	57768	57769	57769	he	135	" My spectacles are blackguardly , "
57772	57783	57769	57769	he	135	" but I 'm not . Look at my face . "
57784	57799	57801	57802	the President	2559	" I dare say it 's the sort of face that grows on one , "
57804	57840	57801	57802	the President	2559	" in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day . "
57841	57849	57851	57852	the Secretary	698	" We have no time for tomfoolery , "
57858	57922	57851	57852	the Secretary	698	" We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ? What are you ? Why did you get us all here ? Do you know who and what we are ? Are you a half - witted man playing the conspirator , or are you a clever man playing the fool ? Answer me , I tell you . "
57923	57926	57928	57928	Sunday	111	" Candidates , "
57930	58028	57928	57928	Sunday	111	" are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper . As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know . Well , I will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery . If you want to know what you are , you are a set of highly well - intentioned young jackasses . "
58029	58033	58035	58035	Syme	92	" And you , "
58040	58045	58035	58035	Syme	92	" what are you ? "
58046	58053	58055	58056	the President	2559	" I ? What am I ? "
58079	58257	58059	58059	he	2559	" You want to know what I am , do you ? Bull , you are a man of science . Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them . Syme , you are a poet . Stare at those morning clouds . But I tell you this , that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top - most cloud before the truth about me . You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am . Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf - kings and sages , and poets and lawgivers , all the churches , and all the philosophies . But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay . I have given them a good run for their money , and I will now . "
58314	58344	58301	58301	his	1823	" There 's one thing I 'll tell you though about who I am . I am the man in the dark room , who made you all policemen . "
58537	58541	58528	58528	he	92	" Stop thief ! "
58868	58875	58842	58843	Dr. Bull	135	" What about Martin Tupper now ? "
58876	58884	58886	58886	Bull	135	" What does the old maniac mean ? "
58893	58901	58886	58886	Bull	135	" What does yours say , Syme ? "
58919	58970	58886	58886	Bull	135	" No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that . But , for the last time , where are your goloshes ? The thing is too bad , especially after what uncle said . "
59104	59108	59110	59110	Syme	92	" After him ! "
59112	59129	59110	59110	Syme	92	" He ca n't go astray now . There 's no mistaking a fire - engine . "
59212	59231	59204	59204	he	1875	" Fly at once . The truth about your trouser - stretchers is known . - A FRIEND . "
59391	59398	59399	59399	he	92	" What place can this be ? "
59402	59423	59399	59399	he	92	" Can it be the old devil 's house ? I 've heard he has a house in North London . "
59424	59429	59431	59432	the Secretary	698	" All the better , "
59442	59450	59431	59432	the Secretary	698	" we shall find him at home . "
59451	59460	59462	59462	Syme	92	" No , but it is n't that , "
59468	59487	59462	59462	Syme	92	" I hear the most horrible noises , like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses ! "
59488	59496	59498	59499	the Secretary	698	" His dogs barking , of course , "
59501	59511	59513	59513	Syme	92	" Why not say his black - beetles barking ! "
59533	59533	59524	59524	you	1885	"
59578	59589	59591	59591	Gogol	125	" The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs , "
59612	59619	59620	59620	he	92	" Well , listen to that , "
59623	59633	59620	59620	he	92	" is that a dog - anybody 's dog ? "
59669	59679	59681	59682	the Secretary	698	" Well , his house ought to be hell ! "
59684	59696	59681	59682	the Secretary	698	" and if it is hell , I 'm going in ! "
59745	59751	59752	59752	he	135	" Why , you asses , "
59755	59761	59752	59752	he	135	" it 's the Zoo ! "
59792	59799	59801	59802	the keeper	1894	" Has it come this way ? "
59804	59808	59810	59810	Syme	92	" Has what ? "
59812	59816	59818	59819	the keeper	1894	" The elephant ! "
59821	59831	59818	59819	the keeper	1894	" An elephant has gone mad and run away ! "
59832	59842	59844	59846	the other stranger	1896	" He has run away with an old gentleman , "
59849	59858	59844	59846	the other stranger	1896	" a poor old gentleman with white hair ! "
59859	59866	59868	59868	Syme	92	" What sort of old gentleman ? "
59874	59887	59889	59890	the keeper	1894	" A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes , "
59893	59896	59898	59898	Syme	92	" Well , "
59900	59985	59898	59898	Syme	92	" if he 's that particular kind of old gentleman , if you 're quite sure that he 's a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him . He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is ! "
60086	60090	60092	60093	the populace	1904	" Stop him ! "
60095	60104	60092	60093	the populace	1904	" He 'll be out of the gate ! "
60105	60110	60112	60113	the keeper	1894	" Stop a landslide ! "
60115	60123	60112	60113	the keeper	1894	" He is out of the gate ! "
60169	60173	60175	60175	Bull	135	" Great Lord ! "
60177	60206	60175	60175	Bull	135	" I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom - cabs again if we are to keep him in sight . "
60561	60574	60575	60580	The man once known as Gogol	1918	" The word , I fancy , should be ' pink ' . "
60833	60840	60842	60842	Syme	92	" Where has he gone to ? "
60849	60858	60860	60861	an official	1933	" Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir ! "
60875	60893	60868	60868	he	1933	" Funny gentleman , sir . Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this . "
60907	60917	60894	60894	He	1933	" To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council . "
60934	60941	60894	60894	He	1933	" When the herring runs a mile ,
60962	60962	60894	60894	He	1933	"
60963	60969	60971	60972	the Secretary	698	" Why the eternal crikey , "
60974	60996	60971	60972	the Secretary	698	" did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to your Exhibition riding on mad elephants ? Do - "
60997	61000	61002	61002	Syme	92	" Look ! "
61005	61010	61002	61002	Syme	92	" Look over there ! "
61011	61016	61018	61019	the Secretary	698	" Look at what ? "
61022	61029	61031	61031	Syme	92	" Look at the captive balloon ! "
61039	61056	61002	61002	Syme	92	" Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ? ' demanded the Secretary . "
61066	61066	61018	61019	the Secretary	698	"
61067	61070	61072	61072	Syme	92	" Nothing , "
61074	61082	61072	61072	Syme	92	" except that it is n't captive ! '
61138	61143	61145	61146	the Secretary	698	" Ten thousand devils ! "
61148	61155	61157	61157	he	698	" He 's got into it ! "
61201	61207	61209	61210	the Professor	798	" God bless my soul ! "
61228	61248	61216	61216	he	798	" God bless my soul ! I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat ! "
61287	61301	61310	61310	Syme	92	" Your beauty has not left me indifferent . - From LITTLE SNOWDROP . "
61317	61337	61310	61310	Syme	92	" I 'm not beaten yet . The blasted thing must come down somewhere . Let 's follow it ! "
61556	61560	61561	61561	he	92	" After all , "
61564	61570	61561	61561	he	92	" it is very beautiful ! "
61571	61579	61581	61582	the Professor	798	" It is singularly and strangely beautiful ! "
61584	61595	61581	61582	the Professor	798	" I wish the beastly gas - bag would burst ! "
61596	61599	61601	61602	Dr. Bull	135	" No , "
61604	61618	61601	61602	Dr. Bull	135	" I hope it wo n't . It might hurt the old boy . "
61619	61623	61625	61627	the vindictive Professor	1957	" Hurt him ! "
61629	61652	61625	61627	the vindictive Professor	1957	" hurt him ! Not as much as I 'd hurt him if I could get up with him . Little Snowdrop ! "
61653	61663	61665	61666	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't want him hurt , somehow , "
61668	61671	61673	61674	the Secretary	698	" What ! "
61677	61701	61673	61674	the Secretary	698	" Do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ? Sunday would say he was anybody . "
61702	61714	61716	61717	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't know whether I believe it or not , "
61719	61741	61716	61717	Dr. Bull	135	" But it is n't that that I mean . I ca n't wish old Sunday 's balloon to burst because - "
61742	61745	61747	61747	Syme	92	" Well , "
61750	61753	61747	61747	Syme	92	" because ? "
61754	61767	61769	61770	Dr. Bull	135	" Well , because he 's so jolly like a balloon himself , "
61773	61877	61769	61770	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards . It seems to make everything nonsense . But I do n't care who knows it , I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself , wicked as he was . Just as if he was a great bouncing baby . How can I explain what my queer sympathy was ? It did n't prevent my fighting him like hell ! Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat ? "
61878	61883	61885	61886	the Secretary	698	" You will not , "
61888	61895	61897	61897	Bull	135	" I 've got it now , "
61899	61978	61897	61897	Bull	135	" it was because he was so fat and so light . Just like a balloon . We always think of fat people as heavy , but he could have danced against a sylph . I see now what I mean . Moderate strength is shown in violence , supreme strength is shown in levity . It was like the old speculations - what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ? "
61979	61983	61985	61985	Syme	92	" Our elephant , "
61990	62000	61985	61985	Syme	92	" has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper . "
62001	62005	62007	62007	Bull	135	" And somehow , "
62009	62151	62007	62007	Bull	135	" that 's why I ca n't help liking old Sunday . No , it 's not an admiration of force , or any silly thing like that . There is a kind of gaiety in the thing , as if he were bursting with some good news . Have n't you sometimes felt it on a spring day ? You know Nature plays tricks , but somehow that day proves they are good - natured tricks . I never read the Bible myself , but that part they laugh at is literal truth , ' Why leap ye , ye high hills ? ' The hills do leap - -at least , they try to .... Why do I like Sunday ? . . . how can I tell you ? . . . because he 's such a Bounder . "
62170	62528	62160	62161	the Secretary	698	" You do not know Sunday at all . Perhaps it is because you are better than I , and do not know hell . I was a fierce fellow , and a trifle morbid from the first . The man who sits in darkness , and who chose us all , chose me because I had all the crazy look of a conspirator - because my smile went crooked , and my eyes were gloomy , even when I smiled . But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men . For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me , not your airy vitality , but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things . I found him smoking in a twilight room , a room with brown blind down , infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives . He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape . He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring . I poured out my most passionate appeals , and asked my most eloquent questions . Then , after a long silence , the Thing began to shake , and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady . It shook like a loathsome and living jelly . It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life - the deep sea lumps and protoplasm . It seemed like the final form of matter , the most shapeless and the most shameful . I could only tell myself , from its shudderings , that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable . And then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter , and the laughter was at me . Do you ask me to forgive him that ? It is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself . "
62529	62537	62160	62161	the Secretary	698	" Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly , "
62547	62815	62160	62161	the Secretary	698	" President Sunday is a terrible fellow for one 's intellect , but he is not such a Barnum 's freak physically as you make out . He received me in an ordinary office , in a grey check coat , in broad daylight . He talked to me in an ordinary way . But I 'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday . His room is neat , his clothes are neat , everything seems in order ; but he 's absent - minded . Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind . For hours he forgets that you are there . Now absent - mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man . We think of a wicked man as vigilant . We ca n't think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we dare n't think of a wicked man alone with himself . An absentminded man means a good - natured man . It means a man who , if he happens to see you , will apologise . But how will you bear an absentminded man who , if he happens to see you , will kill you ? That is what tries the nerves , abstraction combined with cruelty . Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests , and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless . They might ignore or slay . How would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent - minded tiger ? "
62816	62827	62829	62829	Syme	92	" And what do you think of Sunday , Gogol ? "
62831	62841	62843	62843	Gogol	125	" I do n't think of Sunday on principle , "
62846	62858	62843	62843	Gogol	125	" any more than I stare at the sun at noonday . "
62859	62869	62871	62871	Syme	92	" Well , that is a point of view , "
62874	62882	62871	62871	Syme	92	" What do you say , Professor ? "
62902	62908	62910	62910	Syme	92	" Wake up , Professor ! "
62913	62922	62910	62910	Syme	92	" Tell us what you think of Sunday . "
62931	62936	62937	62937	he	798	" I think something , "
62940	62985	62937	62937	he	798	" that I can not say clearly . Or , rather , I think something that I can not even think clearly . But it is something like this . My early life , as you know , was a bit too large and loose .
63077	63077	63078	63078	He	798	"
63094	63329	63078	63078	He	798	" But put it this way . Walking up a road at night , I have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face . If anyone in heaven has that face I shall know him again . Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world . Well , Sunday 's face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away . And so his face has made me , somehow , doubt whether there are any faces . I do n't know whether your face , Bull , is a face or a combination in perspective . Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away . Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump . Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts , the doubts of a spiritualist . I am a Buddhist , I suppose ; and Buddhism is not a creed , it is a doubt . My poor dear Bull , I do not believe that you really have a face . I have not faith enough to believe in matter . "
63358	63366	63367	63367	he	92	" Have you noticed an odd thing , "
63370	63487	63367	63367	he	92	" about all your descriptions ? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different , yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to - the universe itself . Bull finds him like the earth in spring , Gogol like the sun at noonday . The Secretary is reminded of the shapeless protoplasm , and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests . The Professor says he is like a changing landscape . This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President , and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world . "
63488	63497	63499	63499	Bull	135	" Get on a little faster , Syme , "
63501	63507	63499	63499	Bull	135	" never mind the balloon . "
63508	63515	63517	63517	Syme	92	" When I first saw Sunday , "
63520	63605	63517	63517	Syme	92	" I only saw his back ; and when I saw his back , I knew he was the worst man in the world . His neck and shoulders were brutal , like those of some apish god . His head had a stoop that was hardly human , like the stoop of an ox . In fact , I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not a man at all , but a beast dressed up in men 's clothes . "
63606	63610	63612	63613	Dr. Bull	135	" Get on , "
63615	63703	63517	63517	Syme	92	" And then the queer thing happened . I had seen his back from the street , as he sat in the balcony . Then I entered the hotel , and coming round the other side of him , saw his face in the sunlight . His face frightened me , as it did everyone ; but not because it was brutal , not because it was evil . On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good . "
63704	63707	63709	63710	the Secretary	698	" Syme , "
63712	63717	63709	63710	the Secretary	698	" are you ill ? "
63718	63801	63517	63517	Syme	92	" It was like the face of some ancient archangel , judging justly after heroic wars . There was laughter in the eyes , and in the mouth honour and sorrow . There was the same white hair , the same great , grey - clad shoulders that I had seen from behind . But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal , and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god . "
63802	63805	63807	63808	the Professor	798	" Pan , "
63811	63819	63807	63808	the Professor	798	" was a god and an animal . "
63820	63828	63833	63834	a man	251	" Then , and again and always , "
63839	63954	63833	63834	a man	251	" that has been for me the mystery of Sunday , and it is also the mystery of the world . When I see the horrible back , I am sure the noble face is but a mask . When I see the face but for an instant , I know the back is only a jest . Bad is so bad , that we can not but think good an accident ; good is so good , that we feel certain that evil could be explained . But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab , and was just behind him all the way . "
63955	63963	63965	63965	Ratcliffe	168	" Had you time for thinking then ? "
63967	63970	63972	63972	Syme	92	" Time , "
63974	64034	63972	63972	Syme	92	" for one outrageous thought . I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind , blank back of his head really was his face - an awful , eyeless face staring at me ! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards , and dancing as he ran . "
64035	64038	64040	64041	Dr. Bull	135	" Horrible ! "
64046	64053	64055	64055	Syme	92	" Horrible is not the word , "
64057	64110	64055	64055	Syme	92	" It was exactly the worst instant of my life . And yet ten minutes afterwards , when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle , I knew that he was only like a father playing hide - and - seek with his children . "
64111	64118	64120	64121	the Secretary	698	" It is a long game , "
64130	64135	64137	64137	Syme	92	" Listen to me , "
64142	64226	64137	64137	Syme	92	" Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world ? It is that we have only known the back of the world . We see everything from behind , and it looks brutal . That is not a tree , but the back of a tree . That is not a cloud , but the back of a cloud . Can not you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ? If we could only get round in front - "
64227	64230	64233	64233	Bull	135	" Look ! "
64236	64243	64233	64233	Bull	135	" the balloon is coming down ! "
64315	64320	64321	64321	he	92	" He is dead ! "
64324	64340	64321	64321	he	92	" And now I know he was my friend - my friend in the dark ! "
64341	64344	64346	64347	the Secretary	698	" Dead ! "
64349	64387	64346	64347	the Secretary	698	" You will not find him dead easily . If he has been tipped out of the car , we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field , kicking his legs for fun . "
64388	64393	64395	64396	the Professor	798	" Clashing his hoofs , "
64398	64408	64395	64396	the Professor	798	" The colts do , and so did Pan . "
64409	64413	64415	64416	Dr. Bull	135	" Pan again ! "
64419	64428	64415	64416	Dr. Bull	135	" You seem to think Pan is everything . "
64429	64434	64436	64437	the Professor	798	" So he is , "
64439	64447	64436	64437	the Professor	798	" in Greek . He means everything . "
64448	64453	64455	64456	the Secretary	698	" Do n't forget , "
64461	64468	64455	64456	the Secretary	698	" that he also means Panic . "
64479	64485	64486	64486	he	92	" It fell over there , "
64490	64496	64486	64486	he	92	" Let us follow it ! "
64505	64527	64498	64498	he	92	" Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed ! It would be like one of his larks . "
64696	64699	64700	64700	he	1981	" Gentlemen , "
64703	64718	64700	64700	he	1981	" my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by . "
64719	64725	64727	64727	Syme	92	" Who is your master ? "
64733	64742	64744	64745	the man	324	" I was told you knew his name , "
64759	64765	64755	64756	the Secretary	698	" Where is this carriage ? "
64766	64776	64778	64779	the stranger	1986	" It has been waiting only a few moments , "
64781	64790	64778	64779	the stranger	1986	" My master has only just come home . "
64878	64884	64885	64885	Syme	92	" Show us the place , "
65073	65080	65082	65084	Bull of Syme	92	" What can it all mean ? "
65089	65098	65082	65084	Bull of Syme	92	" Is this another joke of Sunday 's ? "
65099	65105	65107	65107	Syme	92	" I do n't know , "
65120	65144	65109	65109	he	92	" but if it is , it 's one of the jokes you talk about . It 's a good - natured one . "
65596	65606	65587	65589	This impressive person	2038	" Refreshments are provided for you in your room . "
65767	65777	65750	65753	a man in blue	2043	" I have put out your clothes , sir . "
65778	65781	65783	65783	Syme	92	" Clothes ! "
65786	65794	65796	65796	he	92	" I have no clothes except these , "
65823	65831	65833	65834	the attendant	2046	" My master asks me to say , "
65894	65894	65879	65879	he	92	"
65895	65903	65905	65905	Syme	92	" Cold pheasant is a good thing , "
65908	65957	65905	65905	Syme	92	" and Burgundy is a spanking good thing . But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me . Where is it ? "
66006	66017	66019	66020	the valet	2049	" You 're to be dressed as Thursday , sir , "
66024	66029	66031	66031	Syme	92	" Dressed as Thursday ! "
66035	66044	66031	66031	Syme	92	" It does n't sound a warm costume . "
66045	66052	66054	66056	the other eagerly	2050	" Oh , yes , sir , "
66058	66075	66054	66056	the other eagerly	2050	" the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir . It fastens up to the chin . "
66076	66085	66087	66087	Syme	92	" Well , I do n't understand anything , "
66091	66158	66087	66087	Syme	92	" I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember . "
66159	66165	66167	66168	the valet	2049	" Beg pardon , sir , "
66170	66177	66185	66185	he	2049	" Bible also provided for you , "
66235	66243	66245	66245	Syme	92	" This is getting wilder and wilder , "
66255	66278	66245	66245	Syme	92	" Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ? Do they provide everything ? "
66279	66286	66288	66289	the attendant	2046	" Yes , sir , everything , "
66292	66302	66288	66289	the attendant	2046	" Shall I help you on with your costume ? "
66303	66312	66314	66314	Syme	92	" Oh , hitch the bally thing on ! "
67382	67397	67379	67379	his	698	" We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field . "
67840	67848	67849	67849	he	111	" We will eat and drink later , "
67852	68009	67849	67849	he	111	" Let us remain together a little , we who have loved each other so sadly , and have fought so long . I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war , in which you were always heroes - epic on epic , iliad on iliad , and you always brothers in arms . Whether it was but recently for time is nothing , or at the beginning of the world , I sent you out to war . I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue . You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again . The sun in heaven denied it , the earth and sky denied it , all human wisdom denied it . And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself . "
68029	68095	68117	68117	his	2122	" But you were men . You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you . I knew how near you were to hell . I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope . "
68129	68136	68117	68117	his	2122	" Who and what are you ? "
68137	68143	68145	68146	the other	310	" I am the Sabbath , "
68150	68158	68145	68146	the other	310	" I am the peace of God . "
68174	68181	68182	68182	he	2122	" I know what you mean , "
68185	68312	68182	68182	he	2122	" and it is exactly that that I can not forgive you . I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation . Well , I am not reconciled . If you were the man in the dark room , why were you also Sunday , an offense to the sunlight ? If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ? We wept , we fled in terror ; the iron entered into our souls - and you are the peace of God ! Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I can not forgive Him His peace . "
68336	68339	68341	68341	Syme	92	" No , "
68343	68412	68341	68341	Syme	92	" I do not feel fierce like that . I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight . But I should like to know . My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out . I should like to know . "
68423	68440	68416	68416	Ratcliffe	168	" It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself . "
68444	68463	68416	68416	Ratcliffe	168	" I understand nothing , but I am happy . In fact , I am going to sleep . "
68464	68470	68472	68473	the Professor	798	" I am not happy , "
68481	68499	68472	68473	the Professor	798	" because I do not understand . You let me stray a little too near to hell . "
68513	68525	68502	68502	Gogol	125	" I wish I knew why I was hurt so much . "
68554	68581	68551	68551	he	111	" I have heard your complaints in order . And here , I think , comes another to complain , and we will hear him also . "
68742	68745	68747	68747	Syme	92	" Gregory ! "
68756	68765	68747	68747	Syme	92	" Why , this is the real anarchist ! "
68766	68769	68771	68771	Gregory	110	" Yes , "
68780	68787	68771	68771	Gregory	110	" I am the real anarchist . "
68788	68797	68799	68799	Bull	92	" ' Now there was a day , ' "
68809	68832	68799	68799	Bull	92	" ' when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . ' "
68833	68838	68840	68840	Gregory	110	" You are right , "
68847	68862	68840	68840	Gregory	110	" I am a destroyer . I would destroy the world if I could . "
68885	68892	68893	68893	he	92	" Oh , most unhappy man , "
68896	68910	68893	68893	he	92	" try to be happy ! You have red hair like your sister . "
68911	68926	68928	68928	Gregory	110	" My red hair , like red flames , shall burn up the world , "
68930	68960	68928	68928	Gregory	110	" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! "
68961	68967	68969	68969	Syme	92	" I never hated you , "
68984	68987	68988	68988	he	92	" You ! "
68991	69213	68988	68988	he	92	" You never hated because you never lived . I know what you are all of you , from first to last - you are the people in power ! You are the police - the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs . The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme . I do not curse you for being cruel . I do not curse you though I might for being kind . I curse you for being safe ! You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them . You are the seven angels of heaven , and you have had no troubles . Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I - "
69226	69231	69232	69232	he	92	" I see everything , "
69235	69408	69232	69232	he	92	" everything that there is . Why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ? Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ? Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ? For the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days . So that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist . So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter . So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ' You lie ! ' No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ' We also have suffered . '
69409	69501	69502	69502	He	2133	" It is not true that we have never been broken . We have been broken upon the wheel . It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones . We have descended into hell . We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness . I repel the slander ; we have not been happy . I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused . At least - "
69524	69528	69529	69529	he	2133	" Have you , "
69536	69542	69529	69529	he	2133	" have you ever suffered ? "
69617	69629	69654	69654	they	2135	" Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? "
