1522	1533	1498	1498	he	340	' Oh , you must not talk about dying yet . '
1534	1543	1545	1546	the nurse	342	' Lor bless her dear heart , no ! '
1573	1603	1562	1562	she	342	' Lor bless her dear heart , when she has lived as long as I have , sir , and had thirteen children of her own , and all on 'em
1650	1751	1644	1647	a dear young lamb	345	' Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother 's prospects failed in producing its due effect . The patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child . The surgeon deposited it in her arms . She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead ; passed her hands over her face ; gazed wildly round ; shuddered ; fell back - and died . They chafed her breast , hands , and temples ; but the blood had stopped forever . They talked of hope and comfort . They had been strangers too long . '
1760	1767	1757	1758	Mrs. Thingummy	138	' said the surgeon at last . '
1777	1808	1809	1810	Poor dear	346	' said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child . '
1812	1813	1809	1810	Poor dear	346	' '
1830	1843	1828	1828	nurse	349	' said the surgeon , putting on his gloves with great deliberation . '
1862	1886	1887	1887	She	321	' He put on his hat , and , pausing by the bed - side on his way to the door , added , '
1903	1904	1899	1899	she	321	' '
1912	1918	1920	1921	the overseer	352	' replied the old woman , '
1963	1977	1960	1960	nobody	354	' The surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand . '
1982	1990	1960	1960	nobody	354	' he said , shaking his head : '
2005	2215	1960	1960	nobody	354	' The medical gentleman walked away to dinner ; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant . What an excellent example of the power of dress , young Oliver Twist was ! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar ; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society . But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service , he was badged and ticketed , and fell into his place at once - a parish child - the orphan of a workhouse - the humble , half - starved drudge - to be cuffed and buffeted through the world - despised by all , and pitied by none . Oliver cried lustily . If he could have known that he was an orphan , left to the tender mercies of church - wardens and overseers , perhaps he would have cried the louder .

2343	2346	2340	2340	Oliver	123	' farmed , '
3135	3148	3150	3151	Mrs. Mann	139	' Goodness gracious ! Is that you , Mr. Bumble , sir ? '
3168	3181	3154	3154	her	139	' Susan , take Oliver and them two brats upstairs , and wash 'em
3204	3262	3189	3190	Mr. Bumble	130	' Now , Mr. Bumble was a fat man , and a choleric ; so , instead of responding to this open - hearted salutation in a kindred spirit , he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake , and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle 's . '
3268	3289	3189	3190	Mr. Bumble	130	' said Mrs. Mann , running out , - for the three boys had been removed by this time , - '
3332	3361	3325	3326	Mr. Bumble	130	' Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church - warden , it by no means mollified the beadle . '
3374	3383	3363	3363	you	0	' inquired Mr. Bumble , grasping his cane , '
3433	3434	3435	3435	I	0	' '
3436	3468	3470	3471	Mrs. Mann	139	'm sure Mr. Bumble , that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you , that it was you a coming , '
3504	3512	3513	3513	he	130	' Well , well , Mrs. Mann , '
3520	3552	3513	3513	he	130	' it may be as you say ; it may be . Lead the way in , Mrs. Mann , for I come on business , and have something to say . '
3626	3636	3622	3623	Mr. Bumble	130	' Now do n't you be offended at what I 'm
3642	3651	3622	3623	Mr. Bumble	130	' observed Mrs. Mann , with captivating sweetness . '
3683	3684	3672	3672	you	130	' '
3693	3710	3713	3713	you	130	' said Mr. Bumble , waving his right hand in a dignified , but placid manner . '
3716	3738	3713	3713	you	130	' said Mrs. Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it . '
3756	3761	3713	3713	you	130	' Mr. Bumble coughed . '
3769	3775	3713	3713	you	130	' said Mrs. Mann persuasively . '
3780	3785	3713	3713	you	130	' inquired the beadle . '
3792	3809	3713	3713	you	130	'm obliged to keep a little of in the house , to put into the blessed infants '
3821	3840	3818	3819	Mr. Bumble	130	' replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard , and took down a bottle and glass . '
3857	3858	3851	3852	Mr. B.	143	' '
3869	3883	3866	3867	Mrs. Mann	139	' inquired Bumble , following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing . '
3887	3898	3900	3901	the nurse	342	'em , that I do , dear as it is , '
3903	3908	3900	3901	the nurse	342	' I could n't see 'em
3919	3920	3917	3917	sir	4564	' '
3922	3929	3900	3901	the nurse	342	' ; said Mr. Bumble approvingly ; '
3945	3953	3942	3943	Mrs. Mann	139	' Here she set down the glass . '
3970	3977	3967	3968	Mrs. Mann	139	' He drew it towards him . '
3987	3997	3998	3998	I	0	' He stirred the gin - and - water . '
4009	4018	4007	4008	Mrs. Mann	139	' ; and he swallowed half of it . '
4024	4037	4007	4008	Mrs. Mann	139	' said the beadle , taking out a leathern pocket - book . '
4056	4057	4059	4059	him	321	' '
4061	4077	4059	4059	him	321	' interposed Mrs. Mann , inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron . '
4115	4119	4059	4059	him	321	' said Bumble , '
4145	4163	4166	4166	he	321	' Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment ; but added , after a moment 's reflection , '
4176	4189	4190	4190	I	0	' The beadle drew himself up with great pride , and said , '
4194	4195	4190	4190	I	0	' '
4201	4202	4203	4203	I	0	' '
4280	4281	4284	4284	you	0	' '
4285	4293	4295	4296	Mrs. Mann	139	're quite a literary character , sir ! '
4298	4303	4305	4306	the beadle	389	' Well , well , '
4314	4328	4305	4306	the beadle	389	' perhaps I may be . Perhaps I may be , Mrs. Mann . '
4341	4381	4329	4329	He	389	' Oliver being now too old to remain here , the board have determined to have him back into the house . I have come out myself to take him there . So let me see him at once . '
4382	4389	4391	4392	Mrs. Mann	139	' I 'll fetch him directly , '
4444	4454	4456	4457	Mrs. Mann	139	' Make a bow to the gentleman , Oliver , '
4482	4492	4494	4495	Mr. Bumble	130	' Will you go along with me , Oliver ? '
4578	4585	4588	4588	Oliver	123	' Will she go with me ? '
4590	4597	4599	4600	Mr. Bumble	130	' No , she ca n't , '
4602	4612	4599	4600	Mr. Bumble	130	' But she 'll come and see you sometimes . '
4872	4876	4880	4881	Mr. Bumble	130	' nearly there . '
5127	5133	5135	5135	Bumble	130	' Bow to the board , '
5164	5172	5174	5179	the gentleman in the high chair	451	' What 's your name , boy ? '
5256	5259	5261	5266	the gentleman in the high chair	451	' Boy , '
5268	5276	5261	5266	the gentleman in the high chair	451	' listen to me . You know you 're
5283	5284	5261	5266	the gentleman in the high chair	451	' '
5291	5296	5261	5266	the gentleman in the high chair	451	' inquired poor Oliver . '
5308	5317	5300	5301	a fool	454	' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . '
5320	5329	5330	5330	You	437	' said the gentleman who had spoken first . '
5354	5355	5358	5358	sir	4564	' '
5360	5367	5358	5358	sir	4564	' replied Oliver , weeping bitterly . '
5374	5400	5370	5370	you	437	' inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat . And to be sure it was very extraordinary . What could the boy be crying for ? '
5410	5419	5403	5403	you	437	' said another gentleman in a gruff voice ; '
5439	5440	5443	5443	sir	4564	' '
5445	5501	5443	5443	sir	4564	' stammered the boy . The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right . It would have been very like a Christian , and a marvellously good Christian too , if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him . But he had n't , because nobody had taught him . '
5518	5530	5504	5504	You	437	' said the red - faced gentleman in the high chair . '
5546	5776	5532	5532	you	437	' added the surly one in the white waistcoat . For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum , Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle , and was then hurried away to a large ward ; where , on a rough , hard bed , he sobbed himself to sleep . What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England ! They let the paupers go to sleep ! Poor Oliver ! He little thought , as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him , that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes . But they had . And this was it : The members of this board were very sage , deep , philosophical men ; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse , they found out at once , what ordinary folks would never have discovered - the poor people liked it ! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes ; a tavern where there was nothing to pay ; a public breakfast , dinner , tea , and supper all the year round ; a brick and mortar elysium , where it was all play and no work . '
5779	5788	5532	5532	you	437	' said the board , looking very knowing ; '
5809	5956	5799	5799	we	467	' So , they established the rule , that all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody , not they , of being starved by a gradual process in the house , or by a quick one out of it . With this view , they contracted with the water - works to lay on an unlimited supply of water ; and with a corn - factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal ; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day , with an onion twice a week , and half a roll of Sundays . They made a great many other wise and humane regulations , having reference to the ladies , which it is not necessary to repeat ; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people , in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors '
6599	6609	6595	6595	his	123	' Please , sir , I want some more . '
6659	6662	6664	6665	the master	502	' What ! '
6674	6679	6681	6681	Oliver	123	' Please , sir , '
6683	6689	6681	6681	Oliver	123	' I want some more . '
6746	6764	6725	6726	Mr. Bumble	130	' Mr. Limbkins , I beg your pardon , sir ! Oliver Twist has asked for more ! '
6778	6782	6784	6785	Mr. Limbkins	147	' For more ! '
6787	6818	6784	6785	Mr. Limbkins	147	' Compose yourself , Bumble , and answer me distinctly . Do I understand that he asked for more , after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary ? '
6819	6825	6827	6827	Bumble	130	' He did , sir , '
6829	6836	6838	6843	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' That boy will be hung , '
6845	6854	6838	6843	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' I know that boy will be hung . '
6939	6951	6961	6961	he	4621	' I never was more convinced of anything in my life , '
6973	6997	6961	6961	he	4621	' I never was more convinced of anything in my life , than I am that that boy will come to be hung . '

8093	8098	8071	8076	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' said Mr. Gamfield . '
8104	8118	8101	8102	my man	555	' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , with a condescending smile . '

8149	8154	8155	8155	I	0	' said Mr. Gamfield , '
8158	8169	8176	8181	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' prentis , and I am ready to take him . '
8170	8174	8176	8181	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' Walk in , '
8234	8241	8243	8244	Mr. Limbkins	147	' It 's a nasty trade , '
8254	8265	8267	8268	another gentleman	561	' Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now , '
8270	8287	8267	8268	another gentleman	561	' That 's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make 'em
8292	8296	8267	8268	another gentleman	561	' said Gamfield ; '
8311	8360	8267	8268	another gentleman	561	' no use at all in making a boy come down , for it only sinds him to sleep , and that 's wot he likes . Boys is wery obstinit , and wery lazy , Gen'l'men , and there 's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em

8446	8451	8514	8515	Mr. Limbkins	147	' saving of expenditure , '
8452	8459	8420	8421	Mr. Limbkins	147	' looked well in the accounts , '
8460	8467	8514	8515	Mr. Limbkins	147	' have a printed report published , '
8518	8533	8514	8515	Mr. Limbkins	147	' We have considered your proposition , and we do n't approve of it . '
8534	8539	8541	8546	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' Not at all , '
8548	8552	8554	8556	the other members	567	' Decidedly not , '
8655	8667	8669	8670	Mr. Gamfield	150	' So you wo n't let me have him , gen'l'men ? '
8677	8680	8682	8683	Mr. Limbkins	147	' No , '
8685	8710	8682	8683	Mr. Limbkins	147	' at least , as it 's a nasty business , we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered . '
8733	8758	8724	8724	he	150	' What 'll you give , gen'l'men ? Come ! Do n't be too hard on a poor man . What 'll you give ? '
8759	8770	8772	8773	Mr. Limbkins	147	' I should say , three pound ten was plenty , '
8775	8781	8783	8788	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' Ten shillings too much , '
8790	8793	8795	8795	Gamfield	150	' Come ! '
8797	8822	8795	8795	Gamfield	150	' say four pound , gen'l'men . Say four pound , and you 've got rid of him for good and all . There ! '
8823	8828	8830	8831	Mr. Limbkins	147	' Three pound ten , '
8835	8846	8848	8848	Gamfield	150	' Come ! I 'll split the diff'erence , gen'l'men , '
8850	8855	8848	8848	Gamfield	150	' Three pound fifteen . '
8856	8862	8868	8869	Mr. Limbkins	147	' Not a farthing more , '
8871	8873	8868	8869	Mr. Limbkins	147	' You 're
8881	8887	8868	8869	Mr. Limbkins	147	' said Gamfield , wavering . '
8894	8903	8904	8904	He	572	' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . '
8973	9152	8932	8932	He	572	' Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table , and , observing a smile on all of them , gradually broke into a smile himself . The bargain was made . Mr. Bumble , was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate , for signature and approval , that very afternoon . In pursuance of this determination , little Oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt . He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance , when Mr. Bumble brought him , with his own hands , a basin of gruel , and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread . At this tremendous sight , Oliver began to cry very piteously : thinking , not unnaturally , that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose , or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way . '
9170	9182	9183	9183	You	123	' said Mr. Bumble , in a tone of impressive pomposity . '
9184	9191	9195	9195	Oliver	123	're a going to be made a '
9197	9198	9199	9200	A prentice	576	' '
9204	9211	9202	9202	sir	4564	' said the child , trembling . '
9216	9221	9214	9214	Oliver	123	' said Mr. Bumble . '
9249	9251	9214	9214	Oliver	123	' prentice '
9310	9343	9301	9308	a naughty orphan which nobody ca n't love	581	' As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath , after delivering this address in an awful voice , the tears rolled down the poor child 's face , and he sobbed bitterly . '
9346	9371	9301	9308	a naughty orphan which nobody ca n't love	581	' said Mr. Bumble , somewhat less pompously , for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced ; '
9403	9580	9401	9401	Oliver	123	' It certainly was , for there was quite enough water in it already . On their way to the magistrate , Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do , would be to look very happy , and say , when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed , that he should like it very much indeed ; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey : the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint , that if he failed in either particular , there was no telling what would be done to him . When they arrived at the office , he was shut up in a little room by himself , and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there , until he came back to fetch him . There the boy remained , with a palpitating heart , for half an hour . At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head , unadorned with the cocked hat , and said aloud : '
9593	9617	9583	9583	Oliver	123	' As Mr. Bumble said this , he put on a grim and threatening look , and added , in a low voice , '
9628	9814	9620	9620	I	0	' Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble 's face at this somewhat contradictory style of address ; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon , by leading him at once into an adjoining room : the door of which was open . It was a large room , with a great window . Behind a desk , sat two old gentleman with powdered heads : one of whom was reading the newspaper ; while the other was perusing , with the aid of a pair of tortoise - shell spectacles , a small piece of parchment which lay before him . Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side ; and Mr. Gamfield , with a partially washed face , on the other ; while two or three bluff - looking men , in top - boots , were lounging about . The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off , over the little bit of parchment ; and there was a short pause , after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk . '
9823	9864	9817	9818	the boy	437	' said Mr. Bumble . The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment , and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve ; whereupon , the last - mentioned old gentleman woke up . '
9872	9878	9881	9881	him	437	' said the old gentleman . '
9885	9890	9881	9881	him	437	' replied Mr. Bumble . '
9899	9922	9893	9894	the magistrate	4680	' Oliver roused himself , and made his best obeisance . He had been wondering , with his eyes fixed on the magistrates '
9947	9950	9952	9954	the old gentleman	4702	' Well , '
9956	9967	9952	9954	the old gentleman	4702	' I suppose he 's fond of chimney - sweeping ? '
9968	9977	9979	9979	Bumble	130	' He doats on it , your worship , '
9999	10010	10012	10014	the old gentleman	4702	' And he will be a sweep , will he ? '
10016	10040	10042	10042	Bumble	130	' If we was to bind him to any other trade to - morrow , he 'd run away simultaneous , your worship , '
10044	10080	10082	10084	the old gentleman	4702	' And this man that 's to be his master - you , sir - you 'll treat him well , and feed him , and do all that sort of thing , will you ? '
10086	10098	10100	10101	Mr. Gamfield	150	' When I says I will , I means I will , '
10104	10106	10100	10101	Mr. Gamfield	150	' You 're
10125	10180	10115	10115	you	597	' said the old gentleman : turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver 's premium , whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty . But the magistrate was half blind and half childish , so he could n't reasonably be expected to discern what other people did . '
10188	10198	10186	10186	sir	4564	' said Mr. Gamfield , with an ugly leer . '
10209	10414	10203	10203	you	597	' replied the old gentleman : fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose , and looking about him for the inkstand . It was the critical moment of Oliver 's fate . If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was , he would have dipped his pen into it , and signed the indentures , and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off . But , as it chanced to be immediately under his nose , it followed , as a matter of course , that he looked all over his desk for it , without finding it ; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him , his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist : who , despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble , was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master , with a mingled expression of horror and fear , too palpable to be mistaken , even by a half - blind magistrate . The old gentleman stopped , laid down his pen , and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins ; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect . '
10418	10424	10425	10425	you	601	' said the old gentleman , '
10436	10437	10445	10445	Beadle	151	' '
10447	10467	10445	10445	Beadle	151	' said the other magistrate : laying aside the paper , and leaning forward with an expression of interest . '
10484	10534	10445	10445	Beadle	151	' Oliver fell on his knees , and clasping his hands together , prayed that they would order him back to the dark room - that they would starve him - beat him - kill him if they pleased - rather than send him away with that dreadful man . '
10537	10552	10445	10445	Beadle	151	' said Mr. Bumble , raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity . '
10579	10580	10571	10577	one of the most bare - facedest	605	' '
10587	10605	10582	10582	your	123	' said the second old gentleman , when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective . '
10613	10624	10606	10606	I	0	' said Mr. Bumble , incredulous of having heard aright . '
10632	10633	10626	10627	your worship	587	' '
10640	10678	10637	10637	your	123	' Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment . A beadle ordered to hold his tongue ! A moral revolution ! The old gentleman in the tortoise - shell spectacles looked at his companion , he nodded significantly . '
10686	10702	10703	10703	I	0	' said the old gentleman : tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke . '
10706	10711	10703	10703	I	0	' stammered Mr. Limbkins : '
10740	10741	10714	10715	the magistrates	4703	' '
10756	10764	10742	10743	The magistrates	4703	' said the second old gentleman sharply . '
10784	11280	10778	10778	He	437	' That same evening , the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed , not only that Oliver would be hung , but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain . Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery , and said he wished he might come to good ; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied , that he wished he might come to him ; which , although he agreed with the beadle in most matters , would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description . The next morning , the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again To Let , and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him . CHAPTER IV OLIVER , BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE , MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE In great families , when an advantageous place can not be obtained , either in possession , reversion , remainder , or expectancy , for the young man who is growing up , it is a very general custom to send him to sea . The board , in imitation of so wise and salutary an example , took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist , in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port . This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him : the probability being , that the skipper would flog him to death , in a playful mood , some day after dinner , or would knock his brains out with an iron bar ; both pastimes being , as is pretty generally known , very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class . The more the case presented itself to the board , in this point of view , the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared ; so , they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually , was to send him to sea without delay . Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries , with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin - boy without any friends ; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission ; when he encountered at the gate , no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry , the parochial undertaker . Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt , large - jointed man , attired in a suit of threadbare black , with darned cotton stockings of the same colour , and shoes to answer . His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect , but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity . His step was elastic , and his face betokened inward pleasantry , as he advanced to Mr. Bumble , and shook him cordially by the hand . '
11298	11303	11295	11296	Mr. Bumble	130	' said the undertaker . '
11313	11346	11310	11311	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' said the beadle , as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff - box of the undertaker : which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin . '
11358	11379	11355	11356	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' repeated Mr. Bumble , tapping the undertaker on the shoulder , in a friendly manner , with his cane . '
11383	11402	11355	11356	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event . '
11416	11417	11413	11414	Mr. Bumble	130	' '
11423	11470	11475	11476	Mr. Bumble	130	' replied the beadle : with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in . Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this : as of course he ought to be ; and laughed a long time without cessation . '
11478	11484	11475	11476	Mr. Bumble	130	' he said at length , '
11549	11550	11522	11523	Mr. Bumble	130	' '
11555	11560	11522	11523	Mr. Bumble	130	' said Mr. Bumble , '
11577	11578	11522	11523	Mr. Bumble	130	' '
11585	11590	11522	11523	Mr. Bumble	130	' replied the undertaker ; '
11627	11628	11625	11625	he	618	' '
11632	11637	11625	11625	he	618	' said Mr. Bumble . '
11643	11659	11639	11639	I	0	' continued the undertaker , resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted : '
11759	11822	11726	11727	Mr. Bumble	130	' As Mr. Sowerberry said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill - used man ; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish ; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject . Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind , he made him his theme . '
11827	11832	11726	11727	Mr. Bumble	130	' said Mr. Bumble , '
11848	11882	11888	11888	he	130	' prentis , who is at present a dead - weight ; a millstone , as I may say , round the porochial throat ? Liberal terms , Mr. Sowerberry , liberal terms ? '
11906	11909	11888	11888	he	130	' five pounds '
11922	11925	11927	11928	the undertaker	481	' Gadso ! '
11944	11982	11927	11928	the undertaker	481	' that 's just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about . You know - dear me , what a very elegant button this is , Mr. Bumble ! I never noticed it before . '
11983	11992	11994	11995	the beadle	389	' Yes , I think it rather pretty , '
12010	12075	11994	11995	the beadle	389	' The die is the same as the porochial seal - the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man . The board presented it to me on Newyear 's morning , Mr. Sowerberry . I put it on , I remember , for the first time , to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman , who died in a doorway at midnight . '
12076	12080	12082	12083	the undertaker	481	' I recollect , '
12085	12114	12082	12083	the undertaker	481	' The jury brought it in , " Died from exposure to the cold , and want of the common necessaries of life , " did n't they ? '
12119	12131	12133	12134	the undertaker	481	' And they made it a special verdict , I think , '
12136	12152	12133	12134	the undertaker	481	' by adding some words to the effect , that if the relieving officer had - '
12153	12158	12160	12161	the beadle	389	' Tush ! Foolery ! '
12163	12184	12160	12161	the beadle	389	' If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk , they 'd have enough to do . '
12185	12189	12191	12192	the undertaker	481	' Very true , '
12194	12199	12191	12192	the undertaker	481	' they would indeed . '
12200	12203	12205	12206	Mr. Bumble	130	' Juries , '
12224	12234	12205	12206	Mr. Bumble	130	' juries is ineddicated , vulgar , grovelling wretches . '
12235	12240	12242	12243	the undertaker	481	' So they are , '
12245	12256	12242	12243	the undertaker	481	' They have n't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em
12260	12270	12242	12243	the undertaker	481	' said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously . '
12276	12281	12282	12282	I	0	' acquiesced the undertaker . '

12298	12303	12305	12306	the undertaker	481	' So do I , '
12308	12331	12333	12334	the beadle	389	' And I only wish we 'd a jury of the independent sort , in the house for a week or two , '
12336	12351	12333	12334	the beadle	389	' the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em
12353	12354	12333	12334	the beadle	389	' '

12435	12443	12537	12538	Mr. Bumble	130	' Well ; what about the boy ? '
12444	12447	12449	12450	the undertaker	481	' Oh ! '
12452	12472	12449	12450	the undertaker	481	' why , you know , Mr. Bumble , I pay a good deal towards the poor 's rates . '
12473	12476	12478	12479	Mr. Bumble	130	' Hem ! '
12481	12484	12478	12479	Mr. Bumble	130	' Well ? '
12485	12488	12490	12491	the undertaker	481	' Well , '
12493	12504	12490	12491	the undertaker	481	' I was thinking that if I pay so much towards 'em
12516	12536	12537	12538	Mr. Bumble	130	'em as I can , Mr. Bumble ; and so - I think I 'll take the boy myself . '

13081	13097	13072	13072	Oliver	123	' Pull that cap off your eyes , and hold up your head , sir . '

13312	13316	13318	13319	Mr. Bumble	130	' So what ? '
13323	13333	13335	13336	the child	321	' So lonely , sir ! So very lonely ! '
13338	13358	13335	13336	the child	321	' Everybody hates me . Oh ! sir , do n't , do n't pray be cross to me ! '

13576	13594	13558	13559	the undertaker	481	' Mrs. Sowerberry , will you have the goodness to come here a moment , my dear ? '
13626	13630	13632	13633	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' My dear , '

14235	14711	14227	14227	HE	123	'S BUSINESS Oliver , being left to himself in the undertaker 's shop , set the lamp down on a workman 's bench , and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread , which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand . An unfinished coffin on black tressels , which stood in the middle of the shop , looked so gloomy and death - like that a cold tremble came over him , every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object : from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head , to drive him mad with terror . Against the wall were ranged , in regular array , a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape : looking in the dim light , like high - shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets . Coffin - plates , elm - chips , bright - headed nails , and shreds of black cloth , lay scattered on the floor ; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths , on duty at a large private door , with a hearse drawn by four black steeds , approaching in the distance . The shop was close and hot . The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins . The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust , looked like a grave . Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver . He was alone in a strange place ; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation . The boy had no friends to care for , or to care for him . The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind ; the absence of no loved and well - remembered face sank heavily into his heart . But his heart was heavy , notwithstanding ; and he wished , as he crept into his narrow bed , that that were his coffin , and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground , with the tall grass waving gently above his head , and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep . Oliver was awakened in the morning , by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop - door : which , before he could huddle on his clothes , was repeated , in an angry and impetuous manner , about twenty - five times . When he began to undo the chain , the legs desisted , and a voice began . '
14719	14735	14717	14717	yer	699	' cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door . '
14743	14756	14736	14736	I	0	' replied Oliver : undoing the chain , and turning the key . '
14768	14778	14781	14781	sir	4564	' said the voice through the key - hole . '
14783	14787	14781	14781	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . '
14793	14798	14791	14791	yer	699	' inquired the voice . '
14803	14807	14791	14791	yer	699	' replied Oliver . '
14818	14823	14809	14809	I	0	' said the voice ; '
14840	15020	15021	15021	I	0	' and having made this obliging promise , the voice began to whistle . Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference , to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice , whoever he might be , would redeem his pledge , most honourably . He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand , and opened the door . For a second or two , Oliver glanced up the street , and down the street , and over the way : impressed with the belief that the unknown , who had addressed him through the key - hole , had walked a few paces off , to warm himself ; for nobody did he see but a big charity - boy , sitting on a post in front of the house , eating a slice of bread and butter : which he cut into wedges , the size of his mouth , with a clasp - knife , and then consumed with great dexterity . '
15028	15043	15045	15045	you	705	' said Oliver at length : seeing that no other visitor made his appearance ; '
15048	15049	15045	15045	you	705	' '
15053	15060	15050	15050	I	0	' replied the charity - boy . '
15069	15107	15062	15062	you	705	' inquired Oliver , innocently . At this , the charity - boy looked monstrous fierce ; and said that Oliver would want one before long , if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way . '
15121	15145	15119	15119	Work'us	159	' said the charity - boy , in continuation : descending from the top of the post , meanwhile , with edifying gravity . '
15150	15154	15119	15119	Work'us	159	' rejoined Oliver . '
15156	15161	15163	15166	the charity - boy	4834	'm Mister Noah Claypole , '
15168	15171	15163	15166	the charity - boy	4834	' and you 're
15185	15321	15322	15322	he	0	' With this , Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver , and entered the shop with a dignified air , which did him great credit . It is difficult for a large - headed , small - eyed youth , of lumbering make and heavy countenance , to look dignified under any circumstances ; but it is more especially so , when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls . Oliver , having taken down the shutters , and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day , was graciously assisted by Noah : who having consoled him with the assurance that '
15327	15349	15322	15322	he	0	' condescended to help him . Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after . Shortly afterwards , Mrs. Sowerberry appeared . Oliver having '
15353	15371	15322	15322	he	0	' in fulfilment of Noah 's prediction , followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast . '
15379	15383	15377	15377	Noah	134	' said Charlotte . '
15462	15463	15467	15467	Work'us	159	' '
15469	15474	15467	15467	Work'us	159	' said Noah Claypole . '
15479	15483	15477	15477	Noah	134	' said Charlotte , '
15500	15501	15494	15494	you	134	' '
15506	15510	15494	15494	you	134	' said Noah . '
15558	15559	15556	15556	he	437	' '
15566	15720	15556	15556	he	437	' said Charlotte , bursting into a hearty laugh , in which she was joined by Noah ; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist , as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room , and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him . Noah was a charity - boy , but not a workhouse orphan . No chance - child was he , for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents , who lived hard by ; his mother being a washerwoman , and his father a drunken soldier , discharged with a wooden leg , and a diurnal pension of twopence - halfpenny and an unstateable fraction . The shop - boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets , with the ignominious epithets of '
15723	15724	15556	15556	he	437	' '
15727	15866	15867	15868	My dear	583	' and the like ; and Noah had bourne them without reply . But , now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan , at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn , he retorted on him with interest . This affords charming food for contemplation . It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be ; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity - boy . Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker 's some three weeks or a month . Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry - the shop being shut up - were taking their supper in the little back - parlour , when Mr. Sowerberry , after several deferential glances at his wife , said , '
15870	15895	15867	15868	My dear	583	' He was going to say more ; but , Mrs. Sowerberry looking up , with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect , he stopped short . '
15898	15905	15867	15868	My dear	583	' said Mrs. Sowerberry , sharply . '
15913	15918	15867	15868	My dear	583	' said Mr. Sowerberry . '
15924	15929	15921	15921	you	0	' said Mrs. Sowerberry . '
15937	15943	15921	15921	you	0	' said Mr. Sowerberry humbly . '
15963	15964	15956	15956	I	0	' '
15978	15983	15972	15972	you	0	' interposed Mrs. Sowerberry . '
16005	16023	15995	15995	I	0	' As Mrs. Sowerberry said this , she gave an hysterical laugh , which threatened violent consequences . '
16029	16033	16034	16034	I	0	' said Sowerberry , '
16041	16042	16050	16050	mine	0	' '
16052	16062	16064	16065	somebody else	727	' replied Mrs. Sowerberry , in an affecting manner : '
16068	16144	16064	16065	somebody else	727	' Here , there was another hysterical laugh , which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much . This is a very common and much - approved matrimonial course of treatment , which is often very effective . It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging , as a special favour , to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear . After a short duration , the permission was most graciously conceded . '
16155	16160	16149	16150	young Twist	728	' said Mr. Sowerberry . '
16173	16174	16175	16175	He	730	' '
16184	16189	16180	16180	he	730	' observed the lady . '
16203	16208	16197	16197	his	730	' resumed Mr. Sowerberry , '
16224	16257	16214	16214	He	730	' Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment . Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and , without allowing time for any observation on the good lady 's part , proceeded . '
16310	16492	16289	16290	a mute	737	' Mrs. Sowerberry , who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way , was much struck by the novelty of this idea ; but , as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so , under existing circumstances , she merely inquired , with much sharpness , why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband 's mind before ? Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this , as an acquiescence in his proposition ; it was speedily determined , therefore , that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade ; and , with this view , that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required . The occasion was not long in coming . Half an hour after breakfast next morning , Mr. Bumble entered the shop ; and supporting his cane against the counter , drew forth his large leathern pocket - book : from which he selected a small scrap of paper , which he handed over to Sowerberry . '
16495	16508	16289	16290	a mute	737	' said the undertaker , glancing over it with a lively countenance ; '
16517	16518	16289	16290	a mute	737	' '
16530	16554	16555	16555	Bayton	160	' replied Mr. Bumble , fastening the strap of the leathern pocket - book : which , like himself , was very corpulent . '
16557	16572	16555	16555	Bayton	160	' said the undertaker , looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble . '
16580	16590	16591	16592	Obstinate people	739	' Bumble shook his head , as he replied , '
16605	16610	16618	16619	Mr. Sowerberry	154	'm afraid , sir . '
16611	16616	16618	16619	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' Proud , eh ? '
16624	16632	16618	16619	Mr. Sowerberry	154	' Come , that 's too much . '
16633	16640	16642	16643	the beadle	389	' Oh , it 's sickening , '
16645	16651	16642	16643	the beadle	389	' Antimonial , Mr. Sowerberry ! '
16652	16657	16659	16660	the undertaker	481	' So it is , '
16662	16674	16676	16677	the beadle	389	' We only heard of the family the night before last , '
16679	16733	16676	16677	the beadle	389	' and we should n't have known anything about them , then , only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad . He had gone out to dinner ; but his '
16742	16753	16763	16764	the undertaker	481	'em some medicine in a blacking - bottle , offhand . '
16754	16761	16763	16764	the undertaker	481	' Ah , there 's promptness , '
16766	16771	16773	16774	the beadle	389	' Promptness , indeed ! '
16776	16858	16773	16774	the beadle	389	' But what 's the consequence ; what 's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels , sir ? Why , the husband sends back word that the medicine wo n't suit his wife 's complaint , and so she sha n't take it - says she sha n't take it , sir ! Good , strong , wholesome medicine , as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal - heaver , only a week before - sent 'em
16882	16912	16869	16869	he	481	' As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble 's mind in full force , he struck the counter sharply with his cane , and became flushed with indignation . '
16915	16920	16921	16921	I	0	' said the undertaker , '
16928	16929	16921	16921	I	0	' '
16935	16940	16933	16933	sir	4564	' ejaculated the beadle . '
16977	17006	17009	17009	he	481	' Thus saying , Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first , in a fever of parochial excitement ; and flounced out of the shop . '
17025	17041	17017	17017	he	481	' said Mr. Sowerberry , looking after the beadle as he strode down the street . '
17046	17173	17017	17017	he	481	' replied Oliver , who had carefully kept himself out of sight , during the interview ; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble 's voice . He need n't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble 's glance , however ; for that functionary , on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression , thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided , until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years , and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome . '
17176	17186	17017	17017	he	481	' said Mr. Sowerberry , taking up his hat , '
17216	17784	17204	17204	Oliver	123	' Oliver obeyed , and followed his master on his professional mission . They walked on , for some time , through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town ; and then , striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through , paused to look for the house which was the object of their search . The houses on either side were high and large , but very old , and tenanted by people of the poorest class : as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted , without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who , with folded arms and bodies half doubled , occasionally skulked along . A great many of the tenements had shop - fronts ; but these were fast closed , and mouldering away ; only the upper rooms being inhabited . Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay , were prevented from falling into the street , by huge beams of wood reared against the walls , and firmly planted in the road ; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches , for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window , were wrenched from their positions , to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body . The kennel was stagnant and filthy . The very rats , which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness , were hideous with famine . There was neither knocker nor bell - handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped ; so , groping his way cautiously through the dark passage , and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs . Stumbling against a door on the landing , he rapped at it with his knuckles . It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen . The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained , to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed . He stepped in ; Oliver followed him . There was no fire in the room ; but a man was crouching , mechanically , over the empty stove . An old woman , too , had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth , and was sitting beside him . There were some ragged children in another corner ; and in a small recess , opposite the door , there lay upon the ground , something covered with an old blanket . Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place , and crept involuntarily closer to his master ; for though it was covered up , the boy felt that it was a corpse . The man 's face was thin and very pale ; his hair and beard were grizzly ; his eyes were bloodshot . The old woman 's face was wrinkled ; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip ; and her eyes were bright and piercing . Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man . They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside . '
17791	17807	17785	17785	Nobody	354	' said the man , starting fiercely up , as the undertaker approached the recess . '
17825	17826	17829	17831	my good man	755	' '
17833	17850	17829	17831	my good man	755	' said the undertaker , who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes . '
17853	17854	17855	17855	I	0	' '
17859	17876	17877	17877	I	0	' said the man : clenching his hands , and stamping furiously on the floor , - '
17912	17942	17906	17906	she	754	' The undertaker offered no reply to this raving ; but producing a tape from his pocket , knelt down for a moment by the side of the body . '
17945	17967	17906	17906	she	754	' said the man : bursting into tears , and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman ; '
18113	18201	18109	18109	They	759	' He twined his hands in his hair ; and , with a loud scream , rolled grovelling upon the floor : his eyes fixed , and the foam covering his lips . The terrified children cried bitterly ; but the old woman , who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed , menaced them into silence . Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground , she tottered towards the undertaker . '
18207	18243	18202	18202	She	754	' said the old woman , nodding her head in the direction of the corpse ; and speaking with an idiotic leer , more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place . '
18308	18328	18284	18284	Lord	765	' As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment , the undertaker turned to go away . '
18333	18343	18284	18284	Lord	765	' said the old woman in a loud whisper . '
18430	18451	18428	18428	dear	769	' she said eagerly : catching at the undertaker 's coat , as he once more moved towards the door . '
18456	18466	18428	18428	dear	769	' said the undertaker,'of course . Anything you like ! '
18591	18605	18607	18607	Sowerberry	154	' Now , you must put your best leg foremost , old lady ! '
18615	18646	18607	18607	Sowerberry	154	' we are rather late ; and it wo n't do , to keep the clergyman waiting . Move on , my men , - as quick as you like ! '
18973	18978	18980	18980	Sowerberry	154	' Now , Bill ! '
18987	18991	18980	18980	Sowerberry	154	' Fill up ! '
19062	19069	19071	19071	Bumble	130	' Come , my good fellow ! '
19080	19089	19071	19071	Bumble	130	' They want to shut up the yard . '
19202	19207	19209	19209	Sowerberry	154	' Well , Oliver , '
19216	19223	19209	19209	Sowerberry	154	' how do you like it ? '
19224	19232	19234	19234	Oliver	123	' Pretty well , thank you , sir '
19240	19247	19234	19234	Oliver	123	' Not very much , sir . '
19248	19262	19264	19264	Sowerberry	154	' Ah , you 'll get used to it in time , Oliver , '
19266	19278	19264	19264	Sowerberry	154	' Nothing when you are used to it , my boy . '

20169	20172	20174	20174	Noah	134	' Work'us , '
20176	20182	20174	20174	Noah	134	' how 's your mother ? '
20183	20188	20190	20190	Oliver	123	' She 's dead , '
20192	20203	20190	20190	Oliver	123	' do n't you say anything about her to me ! '
20254	20263	20265	20265	Noah	134	' What did she die of , Work'us ? '
20267	20281	20283	20283	Oliver	123	' Of a broken heart , some of our old nurses told me , '
20298	20312	20288	20288	he	123	' I think I know what it must be to die of that ! '
20313	20326	20328	20328	Noah	134	' Tol de rol lol lol , right fol lairy , Work'us , '
20339	20348	20328	20328	Noah	134	' What 's set you a snivelling now ? '
20349	20353	20355	20355	Oliver	123	' Not you , '
20359	20381	20355	20355	Oliver	123	' There ; that 's enough . Do n't say anything more to me about her ; you 'd better not ! '
20382	20386	20388	20388	Noah	134	' Better not ! '
20390	20412	20388	20388	Noah	134	' Well ! Better not ! Work'us , do n't be impudent . Your mother , too ! She was a nice '
20421	20452	20453	20453	Yer	846	' And here , Noah nodded his head expressively ; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together , for the occasion . '
20458	20485	20486	20486	Yer	846	' continued Noah , emboldened by Oliver 's silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity : of all tones the most annoying : '
20518	20546	20501	20501	yer	846	'm sure we all are , and pity yer very much . But yer must know , Work'us , yer mother was a regular right - down bad '
20549	20550	20501	20501	yer	846	' '
20556	20565	20553	20553	you	846	' inquired Oliver , looking up very quickly . '
20572	20577	20579	20579	Noah	134	' un , Work'us , '
20583	20629	20630	20630	Crimson	162	' And it 's a great deal better , Work'us , that she died when she did , or else she 'd have been hard labouring in Bridewell , or transported , or hung ; which is more likely than either , is n't it ? '
20777	20783	20785	20785	Noah	134	' He 'll murder me ! '
20787	20815	20785	20785	Noah	134	' Charlotte ! missis ! Here 's the new boy a murdering of me ! Help ! help ! Oliver 's gone mad ! Char - lotte ! '
20879	20886	20888	20888	Charlotte	158	' Oh , you little wretch ! '
20913	20935	20941	20941	Charlotte	158	' Oh , you little un - grate - ful , mur - de - rous , hor - rid villain ! '
21096	21105	21107	21107	Charlotte	158	' Bless her , she 's going off ! '
21109	21122	21107	21107	Charlotte	158	' A glass of water , Noah , dear . Make haste ! '
21123	21128	21130	21131	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' Oh ! Charlotte , '
21163	21181	21154	21154	Noah	134	' Oh ! Charlotte , what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds ! '
21182	21190	21195	21195	I	0	' Ah ! mercy indeed , ma'am , '
21241	21242	21243	21244	Poor fellow	863	' '
21246	21306	21243	21244	Poor fellow	863	' said Mrs. Sowerberry : looking piteously on the charity - boy . Noah , whose top waistcoat - button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver 's head , rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him , and performed some affecting tears and sniffs . '
21313	21318	21243	21244	Poor fellow	863	' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry . '
21346	21365	21336	21336	he	865	' Oliver 's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question , rendered this occurance highly probable . '
21377	21381	21370	21370	I	0	' said Charlotte , '
21391	21392	21394	21395	the millingtary	873	' '
21397	21402	21394	21395	the millingtary	873	' suggested Mr. Claypole . '
21407	21420	21394	21395	the millingtary	873	' said Mrs. Sowerberry : bethinking herself of Oliver 's old friend . '
21473	21632	21757	21758	Mr. Bumble	130	' Noah stopped to make no reply , but started off at his fullest speed ; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking , to see a charity - boy tearing through the streets pell - mell , with no cap on his head , and a clasp - knife at his eye . CHAPTER VII OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace , and paused not once for breath , until he reached the workhouse - gate . Having rested here , for a minute or so , to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror , he knocked loudly at the wicket ; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it , that even he , who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times , started back in astonishment . '
21643	21649	21650	21651	Mr. Bumble	130	' said the old pauper . '
21656	21754	21653	21654	Mr. Bumble	130	' cried Noah , with well - affected dismay : and in tones so loud and agitated , that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself , who happened to be hard by , but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat , - which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance : as showing that even a beadle , acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse , may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self - possession , and forgetfulness of personal dignity . '
21762	21766	21757	21758	Mr. Bumble	130	' said Noah : '
21775	21776	21772	21772	Oliver	123	' '
21781	21796	21808	21808	he	123	' interposed Mr. Bumble : with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes . '
21812	21813	21816	21816	sir	4564	' '
21832	21836	21827	21827	he	123	' replied Noah . '
21872	22063	21870	21870	sir	4564	' And here , Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel - like positions ; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that , from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist , he had sustained severe internal injury and damage , from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture . When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble , he imparted additional effect thereunto , by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before ; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard , he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever : rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice , and rouse the indignation , of the gentleman aforesaid . The gentleman 's notice was very soon attracted ; for he had not walked three paces , when he turned angrily round , and inquired what that young cur was howling for , and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated , an involuntary process ? '
22077	22082	22075	22075	sir	4564	' replied Mr. Bumble , '
22100	22101	22097	22098	young Twist	123	' '
22105	22117	22103	22103	Jove	166	' exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat , stopping short . '
22143	22144	22145	22145	He	885	' '
22158	22170	22154	22156	the female servant	887	' said Mr. Bumble , with a face of ashy paleness . '
22175	22180	22154	22156	the female servant	887	' interposed Mr. Claypole . '
22194	22199	22192	22192	Noah	134	' added Mr. Bumble . '
22213	22217	22218	22218	He	4709	' replied Noah . '
22224	22225	22220	22220	he	4709	' '
22239	22248	22234	22234	he	4709	' inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat . '
22253	22257	22251	22251	sir	4564	' replied Noah . '
22284	22289	22300	22305	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	'cause master 's out . '
22290	22298	22300	22305	the gentleman in the white waistcoat	4621	' Certainly , my boy ; certainly , '
22326	22328	22329	22331	a good boy	668	' You 're
22373	22374	22371	22371	Bumble	130	' '
22383	22527	22528	22528	Oliver	123	' replied the beadle . And the cocked hat and cane having been , by this time , adjusted to their owner 's satisfaction , Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker 's shop . Here the position of affairs had not at all improved . Sowerberry had not yet returned , and Oliver continued to kick , with undiminished vigour , at the cellar - door . The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte , were of so startling a nature , that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley , before opening the door . With this view he gave a kick at the outside , by way of prelude ; and , then , applying his mouth to the keyhole , said , in a deep and impressive tone : '
22530	22531	22534	22534	you	0	' '
22539	22547	22534	22534	you	0	' replied Oliver , from the inside . '
22557	22562	22555	22555	Oliver	123	' said Mr. Bumble . '
22565	22569	22555	22555	Oliver	123	' replied Oliver . '
22591	22596	22589	22589	sir	4564	' said Mr. Bumble . '
22599	22663	22589	22589	sir	4564	' replied Oliver , boldly . An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit , and was in the habit of receiving , staggered Mr. Bumble not a little . He stepped back from the keyhole ; drew himself up to his full height ; and looked from one to another of the three bystanders , in mute astonishment . '
22677	22682	22672	22672	he	130	' said Mrs. Sowerberry . '
22697	22698	22672	22672	he	130	' '
22706	22719	22704	22704	ma'am	4974	' replied Mr. Bumble , after a few moments of deep meditation . '

22728	22733	22704	22704	ma'am	4974	' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry . '
22740	22748	22736	22736	ma'am	4974	' replied Bumble , with stern emphasis . '
22810	22832	22781	22782	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	'em have live bodies . If you had kept the boy on gruel , ma'am , this would never have happened . '
22833	22838	22840	22841	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' Dear , dear ! '
22852	22859	22840	22841	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' this comes of being liberal ! '
22933	22936	22938	22939	Mr. Bumble	130	' Ah ! '
22952	23052	22938	22939	Mr. Bumble	130	' the only thing that can be done now , that I know of , is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so , till he 's a little starved down ; and then to take him out , and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship . He comes of a bad family . Excitable natures , Mrs. Sowerberry ! Both the nurse and doctor said , that that mother of his made her way here , against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well - disposed woman , weeks before . '
23200	23214	23216	23216	Sowerberry	157	' Now , you are a nice young fellow , ai n't you ? '
23230	23237	23239	23239	Oliver	123	' He called my mother names , '
23241	23255	23257	23258	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' Well , and what if he did , you little ungrateful wretch ? '
23260	23270	23257	23258	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' She deserved what he said , and worse . '
23271	23275	23277	23277	Oliver	123	' She did n't '
23279	23283	23285	23286	Mrs. Sowerberry	157	' She did , '
23288	23294	23296	23296	Oliver	123	' It 's a lie ! '
24183	24188	24190	24190	Oliver	123	' Hush , Dick ! '
24212	24218	24202	24202	his	437	' Is any one up ? '
24219	24224	24226	24227	the child	321	' Nobody but me , '
24229	24239	24241	24241	Oliver	123	' You musn't say you saw me , Dick , '
24243	24284	24241	24241	Oliver	123	' I am running away . They beat and ill - use me , Dick ; and I am going to seek my fortune , some long way off . I do n't know where . How pale you are ! '
24285	24296	24298	24299	the child	321	' I heard the doctor tell them I was dying , '
24305	24325	24298	24299	the child	321	' I am very glad to see you , dear ; but do n't stop , do n't stop ! '
24326	24342	24344	24344	Oliver	123	' Yes , yes , I will , to say good - b'ye to you , '
24346	24367	24344	24344	Oliver	123	' I shall see you again , Dick . I know I shall ! You will be well and happy ! '
24368	24373	24375	24376	the child	321	' I hope so , '
24378	24424	24426	24427	the child	321	' After I am dead , but not before . I know the doctor must be right , Oliver , because I dream so much of Heaven , and Angels , and kind faces that I never see when I am awake . Kiss me , '
24445	24456	24437	24437	his	321	' Good - b'ye , dear ! God bless you ! '
24881	24886	24888	24888	Oliver	123	' A clean shirt , '
24890	24923	24888	24888	Oliver	123	' is a very comfortable thing ; and so are two pairs of darned stockings ; and so is a penny ; but they are small helps to a sixty - five miles '
24929	26015	24888	24888	Oliver	123	' But Oliver 's thoughts , like those of most other people , although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties , were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them ; so , after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose , he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder , and trudged on . Oliver walked twenty miles that day ; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread , and a few draughts of water , which he begged at the cottage - doors by the road - side . When the night came , he turned into a meadow ; and , creeping close under a hay - rick , determined to lie there , till morning . He felt frightened at first , for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields : and he was cold and hungry , and more alone than he had ever felt before . Being very tired with his walk , however , he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles . He felt cold and stiff , when he got up next morning , and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf , in the very first village through which he passed . He had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again . His feet were sore , and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him . Another night passed in the bleak damp air , made him worse ; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along . He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage - coach came up , and then begged of the outside passengers ; but there were very few who took any notice of him : and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill , and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny . Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way , but was unable to do it , by reason of his fatigue and sore feet . When the outsides saw this , they put their halfpence back into their pockets again , declaring that he was an idle young dog , and did n't deserve anything ; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind . In some villages , large painted boards were fixed up : warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail . This frightened Oliver very much , and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition . In others , he would stand about the inn - yards , and look mournfully at every one who passed : a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady 's ordering one of the post - boys who were lounging about , to drive that strange boy out of the place , for she was sure he had come to steal something . If he begged at a farmer 's house , ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him ; and when he showed his nose in a shop , they talked about the beadle - which brought Oliver 's heart into his mouth , - very often the only thing he had there , for many hours together . In fact , if it had not been for a good - hearted turnpike - man , and a benevolent old lady , Oliver 's troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother 's ; in other words , he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king 's highway . But the turnpike - man gave him a meal of bread and cheese ; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could afford - and more - with such kind and gentle words , and such tears of sympathy and compassion , that they sank deeper into Oliver 's soul , than all the sufferings he had ever undergone . Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place , Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet . The window - shutters were closed ; the street was empty ; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day . The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty ; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation , as he sat , with bleeding feet and covered with dust , upon a door - step . By degrees , the shutters were opened ; the window - blinds were drawn up ; and people began passing to and fro . Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two , or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by ; but none relieved him , or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there . He had no heart to beg . And there he sat . He had been crouching on the step for some time : wondering at the great number of public - houses every other house in Barnet was a tavern , large or small , gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through , and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do , with ease , in a few hours , what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish : when he was roused by observing that a boy , who had passed him carelessly some minutes before , had returned , and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way . He took little heed of this at first ; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long , that Oliver raised his head , and returned his steady look . Upon this , the boy crossed over ; and walking close up to Oliver , said , '
26026	26268	26271	26272	my covey	974	' The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer , was about his own age : but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen . He was a snub - nosed , flat - browed , common - faced boy enough ; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see ; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man . He was short of his age : with rather bow - legs , and little , sharp , ugly eyes . His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly , that it threatened to fall off every moment - and would have done so , very often , if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch , which brought it back to its old place again . He wore a man 's coat , which reached nearly to his heels . He had turned the cuffs back , half - way up his arm , to get his hands out of the sleeves : apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers ; for there he kept them . He was , altogether , as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six , or something less , in the bluchers . '
26279	26288	26289	26289	I	0	' said this strange young gentleman to Oliver . '
26296	26310	26311	26311	I	0	' replied Oliver : the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke . '
26326	26327	26318	26318	I	0	' '
26333	26339	26342	26342	I	0	' said the young gentleman . '
26353	26364	26365	26365	I	0	' he added , noticing Oliver 's look of surprise , '
26386	26407	26408	26408	My	0	' Oliver mildly replied , that he had always heard a bird 's mouth described by the term in question . '
26414	26420	26408	26408	My	0	' exclaimed the young gentleman . '
26464	26465	26458	26458	you	0	' '
26469	26473	26458	26458	you	0	' inquired Oliver . '
26528	26534	26535	26535	you	0	' said the young gentleman ; '
26546	26589	26849	26849	I	0	'm at low - water - mark myself - only one bob and a magpie ; but , as far as it goes , I 'll fork out and stump . Up with you on your pins . There ! Now then ! '
26592	26635	26849	26849	I	0	' Assisting Oliver to rise , the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler 's shop , where he purchased a sufficiency of ready - dressed ham and a half - quartern loaf , or , as he himself expressed it , '
26640	26765	26849	26849	I	0	' the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust , by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb , and stuffing it therein . Taking the bread under his arm , the young gentlman turned into a small public - house , and led the way to a tap - room in the rear of the premises . Here , a pot of beer was brought in , by direction of the mysterious youth ; and Oliver , falling to , at his new friend 's bidding , made a long and hearty meal , during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention . '
26770	26783	26856	26857	the boy	437	' said the strange boy , when Oliver had at length concluded . '
26786	26787	26856	26857	the boy	437	' '
26792	26793	26856	26857	the boy	437	' '
26796	26797	26856	26857	the boy	437	' '
26800	26801	26856	26857	the boy	437	' '
26804	26831	26856	26857	the boy	437	' The strange boy whistled ; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat - sleeves would let them go . '
26838	26842	26833	26833	you	984	' inquired Oliver . '
26850	26854	26856	26857	the boy	437	'm at home , '
26859	26877	26856	26857	the boy	437	' I suppose you want some place to sleep in to - night , do n't you ? '
26878	26884	26886	26886	Oliver	123	' I do , indeed , '
26888	26902	26886	26886	Oliver	123	' I have not slept under a roof since I left the country . '
26903	26913	26915	26917	the young gentleman	5093	' Do n't fret your eyelids on that score , '
26919	26935	26915	26917	the young gentleman	5093	' I 've got to be in London to - night ; and I know a '
26991	27163	27164	27166	The Artful Dodger	989	' The young gentleman smiled , as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical ; and finished the beer as he did so . This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted ; especially as it was immediately followed up , by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to , would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place , without loss of time . This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue ; from which Oliver discovered that his friend 's name was Jack Dawkins , and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned . Mr. Dawkin 's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron 's interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection ; but , as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing , and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of '
27168	27625	27164	27166	The Artful Dodger	989	' Oliver concluded that , being of a dissipated and careless turn , the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him . Under this impression , he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible ; and , if he found the Dodger incorrigible , as he more than half suspected he should , to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance . As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall , it was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington . They crossed from the Angel into St. John 's Road ; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler 's Wells Theatre ; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row ; down the little court by the side of the workhouse ; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley - in - the - Hole ; thence into Little Saffron Hill ; and so into Saffron Hill the Great : along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace , directing Oliver to follow close at his heels . Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader , he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way , as he passed along . A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen . The street was very narrow and muddy , and the air was impregnated with filthy odours . There were a good many small shops ; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children , who , even at that time of night , were crawling in and out at the doors , or screaming from the inside . The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place , were the public - houses ; and in them , the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main . Covered ways and yards , which here and there diverged from the main street , disclosed little knots of houses , where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth ; and from several of the door - ways , great ill - looking fellows were cautiously emerging , bound , to all appearance , on no very well - disposed or harmless errands . Oliver was just considering whether he had n't better run away , when they reached the bottom of the hill . His conductor , catching him by the arm , pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane ; and drawing him into the passage , closed it behind them . '
27630	27646	27164	27166	The Artful Dodger	989	' cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the Dodger . '
27651	27710	27164	27166	The Artful Dodger	989	' was the reply . This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right ; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage ; and a man 's face peeped out , from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away . '
27717	27736	27164	27166	The Artful Dodger	989	' said the man , thrusting the candle farther out , and shielding his eyes with his hand . '
27743	27744	27745	27747	A new pal	992	' '
27749	27758	27745	27747	A new pal	992	' replied Jack Dawkins , pulling Oliver forward . '
27765	27766	27745	27747	A new pal	992	' '
27773	27774	27777	27777	he	992	' '
27781	27789	27777	27777	he	992	' the wipes . Up with you ! '
28115	28122	28124	28125	Jack Dawkins;'my	175	' This is him , Fagin , '
28130	28284	28124	28125	Jack Dawkins;'my	175	' The Jew grinned ; and , making a low obeisance to Oliver , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance . Upon this , the young gentleman with the pipes came round him , and shook both his hands very hard - especially the one in which he held his little bundle . One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him ; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets , in order that , as he was very tired , he might not have the trouble of emptying them , himself , when he went to bed . These civilities would probably be extended much farther , but for a liberal exercise of the Jew 's toasting - fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them . '
28297	28302	28293	28293	Oliver	123	' said the Jew . '
28323	28344	28322	28322	you	1009	're a - staring at the pocket - handkerchiefs ! eh , my dear . There are a good many of 'em
28354	28378	28322	28322	you	1009	'em out , ready for the wash ; that 's all , Oliver ; that 's all . Ha ! ha ! ha ! '
28922	28925	28927	28928	the Jew	1006	' Aha ! '
28944	29006	28927	28928	the Jew	1006	' Clever dogs ! Clever dogs ! Staunch to the last ! Never told the old parson where they were . Never poached upon old Fagin ! And why should they ? It would n't have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer . No , no , no ! Fine fellows ! Fine fellows ! '
29168	29204	29147	29147	he	1006	' What a fine thing capital punishment is ! Dead men never repent ; dead men never bring awkward stories to light . Ah , it 's a fine thing for the trade ! Five of 'em
29224	29354	29163	29163	his	1006	' As the Jew uttered these words , his bright dark eyes , which had been staring vacantly before him , fell on Oliver 's face ; the boy 's eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity ; and although the recognition was only for an instant - for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived - it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed . He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash ; and , laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table , started furiously up . He trembled very much though ; for , even in his terror , Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air . '
29359	29364	29163	29163	his	1006	' said the Jew . '
29395	29407	29409	29409	Oliver	123	' I was n't able to sleep any longer , sir , '
29413	29426	29409	29409	Oliver	123	' I am very sorry if I have disturbed you , sir . '

29611	29624	29626	29627	the Jew	1006	' Did you see any of these pretty things , my dear ? '
29639	29644	29646	29646	Oliver	123	' Yes , sir , '
29648	29651	29653	29654	the Jew	1006	' Ah ! '

29703	29768	29685	29686	The folks	1039	' Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place , with so many watches ; but , thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys , cost him a good deal of money , he only cast a deferential look at the Jew , and asked if he might get up . '
29776	29782	29685	29686	The folks	1039	' replied the old gentleman . '
29816	29940	29803	29803	I	0	' Oliver got up ; walked across the room ; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher . When he turned his head , the box was gone . He had scarcely washed himself , and made everything tidy , by emptying the basin out of the window , agreeably to the Jew 's directions , when the Dodger returned : accompanied by a very sprightly young friend , whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night , and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates . The four sat down , to breakfast , on the coffee , and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat . '
29943	29960	29803	29803	I	0	' said the Jew , glancing slyly at Oliver , and addressing himself to the Dodger , '

29978	29983	29963	29963	you	1045	' replied the Dodger . '

29999	30004	29963	29963	you	1045	' said the Jew . '

30021	30027	30007	30007	you	1045	' replied that young gentlman . '
30030	30038	30007	30007	you	1045	' inquired the Jew , with eagerness . '
30042	30061	30007	30007	you	1045	' replied the Dodger , producing two pocket - books ; one green , and the other red . '
30070	30082	30007	30007	you	1045	' said the Jew , after looking at the insides carefully ; '

30106	30139	30104	30104	sir	4564	' said Oliver . At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously ; very much to the amazement of Oliver , who saw nothing to laugh at , in anything that had passed . '
30149	30156	30143	30143	you	123	' said Fagin to Charley Bates . '
30159	30174	30143	30143	you	123	' replied Master Bates ; at the same time producing four pocket - handkerchiefs . '
30177	30186	30143	30143	you	123	' said the Jew , inspecting them closely ; '
30188	30240	30250	30250	Oliver	123	're very good ones , very . You have n't marked them well , though , Charley ; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle , and we 'll teach Oliver how to do it . Shall us , Oliver , eh ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! '
30241	30248	30250	30250	Oliver	123	' If you please , sir , '
30252	30277	30279	30280	the Jew	1006	' You 'd like to be able to make pocket - handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates , would n't you , my dear ? '
30282	30296	30298	30298	Oliver	123	' Very much , indeed , if you 'll teach me , sir , '
30344	30351	30353	30353	Charley	179	' He is so jolly green ! '
31036	31042	31044	31044	Fagin	174	' There , my dear , '
31046	31065	31044	31044	Fagin	174	' That 's a pleasant life , is n't it ? They have gone out for the day . '
31066	31074	31076	31076	Oliver	123	' Have they done work , sir ? '
31078	31081	31083	31084	the Jew	1006	' Yes , '

31216	31221	31223	31223	Oliver	123	' Yes , sir , '
31225	31253	31223	31223	Oliver	123	' See if you can take it out , without my feeling it ; as you saw them do , when we were at play this morning . '
31287	31292	31294	31295	the Jew	1006	' Is it gone ? '
31297	31304	31306	31306	Oliver	123	' Here it is , sir , '
31314	31316	31306	31306	Oliver	123	' You 're
31324	31338	31317	31319	a clever boy	1086	' said the playful old gentleman , patting Oliver on the head approvingly . '
31392	32031	31378	31378	I	0	' Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman 's pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man . But , thinking that the Jew , being so much his senior , must know best , he followed him quietly to the table , and was soon deeply involved in his new study . CHAPTER X OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES ; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE . BEING A SHORT , BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER , IN THIS HISTORY For many days , Oliver remained in the Jew 's room , picking the marks out of the pocket - handkerchief , of which a great number were brought home , and sometimes taking part in the game already described : which the two boys and the Jew played , regularly , every morning . At length , he began to languish for fresh air , and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions . Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed , by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman 's character . Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night , empty - handed , he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits ; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life , by sending them supperless to bed . On one occasion , indeed , he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs ; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent . At length , one morning , Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought . There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon , for two or three days , and the dinners had been rather meagre . Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman 's giving his assent ; but , whether they were or no , he told Oliver he might go , and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates , and his friend the Dodger . The three boys sallied out ; the Dodger with his coat - sleeves tucked up , and his hat cocked , as usual ; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets ; and Oliver between them , wondering where they were going , and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in , first . The pace at which they went , was such a very lazy , ill - looking saunter , that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman , by not going to work at all . The Dodger had a vicious propensity , too , of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas ; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property , by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides , and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious , that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction . These things looked so bad , that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back , in the best way he could ; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel , by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger . They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell , which is yet called , by some strange perversion of terms , '
32034	32066	32719	32720	Stop thief	1094	' : when the Dodger made a sudden stop ; and , laying his finger on his lip , drew his companions back again , with the greatest caution and circumspection . '
32072	32076	32719	32720	Stop thief	1094	' demanded Oliver . '
32079	32084	32719	32720	Stop thief	1094	' replied the Dodger . '
32097	32098	32099	32101	The old gentleman	4702	' '
32106	32110	32099	32101	The old gentleman	4702	' said Oliver . '
32117	32118	32115	32115	him	4702	' '
32123	32128	32119	32119	He	4702	' said the Doger . '
32133	32620	32622	32622	thief	1093	' observed Master Charley Bates . Oliver looked from one to the other , with the greatest surprise ; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries ; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road , and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed . Oliver walked a few paces after them ; and , not knowing whether to advance or retire , stood looking on in silent amazement . The old gentleman was a very respectable - looking personage , with a powdered head and gold spectacles . He was dressed in a bottle - green coat with a black velvet collar ; wore white trousers ; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm . He had taken up a book from the stall , and there he stood , reading away , as hard as if he were in his elbow - chair , in his own study . It is very possible that he fancied himself there , indeed ; for it was plain , from his abstraction , that he saw not the book - stall , nor the street , nor the boys , nor , in short , anything but the book itself : which he was reading straight through : turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page , beginning at the top line of the next one , and going regularly on , with the greatest interest and eagerness . What was Oliver 's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off , looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go , to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman 's pocket , and draw from thence a handkerchief ! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates ; and finally to behold them , both running away round the corner at full speed ! In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs , and the watches , and the jewels , and the Jew , rushed upon the boy 's mind . He stood , for a moment , with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror , that he felt as if he were in a burning fire ; then , confused and frightened , he took to his heels ; and , not knowing what he did , made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground . This was all done in a minute 's space . In the very instant when Oliver began to run , the old gentleman , putting his hand to his pocket , and missing his handkerchief , turned sharp round . Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace , he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator ; and shouting '
32624	32718	32622	32622	thief	1093	' with all his might , made off after him , book in hand . But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue - and - cry . The Dodger and Master Bates , unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street , had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner . They no sooner heard the cry , and saw Oliver running , than , guessing exactly how the matter stood , they issued forth with great promptitude ; and , shouting '
32722	32810	32812	32812	thief	1093	' too , joined in the pursuit like good citizens . Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self - preservation is the first law of nature . If he had been , perhaps he would have been prepared for this . Not being prepared , however , it alarmed him the more ; so away he went like the wind , with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him . '
32817	32938	32815	32815	thief	1093	' There is a magic in the sound . The tradesman leaves his counter , and the car - man his waggon ; the butcher throws down his tray ; the baker his basket ; the milkman his pail ; the errand - boy his parcels ; the school - boy his marbles ; the paviour his pickaxe ; the child his battledore . Away they run , pell - mell , helter - skelter , slap - dash : tearing , yelling , screaming , knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners , rousing up the dogs , and astonishing the fowls : and streets , squares , and courts , re - echo with the sound . '
32945	33026	32942	32943	Stop thief	1094	' The cry is taken up by a hundred voices , and the crowd accumulate at every turning . Away they fly , splashing through the mud , and rattling along the pavements : up go the windows , out run the people , onward bear the mob , a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot , and , joining the rushing throng , swell the shout , and lend fresh vigour to the cry , '
33033	33034	33031	33031	thief	1093	' '
33041	33117	33038	33039	Stop thief	1094	' There is a passion FOR hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast . One wretched breathless child , panting with exhaustion ; terror in his looks ; agony in his eyes ; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face ; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers ; and as they follow on his track , and gain upon him every instant , they hail his decreasing strength with joy . '
33121	33175	33119	33119	thief	1093	' Ay , stop him for God 's sake , were it only in mercy ! Stopped at last ! A clever blow . He is down upon the pavement ; and the crowd eagerly gather round him : each new comer , jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse . '

33237	33284	33231	33231	sir	4564	' Oliver lay , covered with mud and dust , and bleeding from the mouth , looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him , when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers . '
33287	33292	33231	33231	sir	4564	' said the gentleman , '

33305	33310	33298	33299	the boy	437	' murmured the crowd . '

33319	33323	33325	33326	the gentleman	4618	' Poor fellow ! '

33370	33464	33364	33364	I	0	' The follow touched his hat with a grin , expecting something for his pains ; but , the old gentleman , eyeing him with an expression of dislike , look anxiously round , as if he contemplated running away himself : which it is very possible he might have attempted to do , and thus have afforded another chase , had not a police officer who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made his way through the crowd , and seized Oliver by the collar . '
33470	33477	33364	33364	I	0	' said the man , roughly . '
33496	33509	33492	33494	two other boys	1113	' said Oliver , clasping his hands passionately , and looking round . '
33515	33516	33520	33520	they	1113	' '
33524	33560	33520	33520	they	1113	' said the officer . He meant this to be ironical , but it was true besides ; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to . '
33566	33567	33520	33520	they	1113	' '
33573	33581	33520	33520	they	1113	' said the old gentleman , compassionately . '
33591	33608	33585	33585	I	0	' replied the officer , tearing his jacket half off his back , in proof thereof . '
33631	33850	33621	33621	you	1114	' Oliver , who could hardly stand , made a shift to raise himself on his feet , and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket - collar , at a rapid pace . The gentleman walked on with them by the officer 's side ; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at Oliver from time to time . The boys shouted in triumph ; and on they went . CHAPTER XI TREATS OF MR . FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE ; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE The offence had been committed within the district , and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of , a very notorious metropolitan police office . The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets , and down a place called Mutton Hill , when he was led beneath a low archway , and up a dirty court , into this dispensary of summary justice , by the back way . It was a small paved yard into which they turned ; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face , and a bunch of keys in his hand . '
33857	33863	33864	33868	A young fogle - hunter	1116	' said the man carelessly . '
33870	33880	33864	33868	A young fogle - hunter	1116	' replied the man who had Oliver in charge . '
33892	33900	33890	33890	sir	4564	' inquired the man with the keys . '
33906	33912	33890	33890	sir	4564	' replied the old gentleman ; '
33936	33937	33926	33926	I	0	' '
33947	33952	33945	33945	sir	4564	' replied the man . '
33968	34172	33965	33966	young gallows	1122	' This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke , and which led into a stone cell . Here he was searched ; and nothing being found upon him , locked up . This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar , only not so light . It was most intolerably dirty ; for it was Monday morning ; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people , who had been locked up , elsewhere , since Saturday night . But this is little . In our station - houses , men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges - the word is worth noting - in dungeons , compared with which , those in Newgate , occupied by the most atrocious felons , tried , found guilty , and under sentence of death , are palaces . Let any one who doubts this , compare the two . The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock . He turned with a sigh to the book , which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance . '
34182	34210	34347	34347	He	0	' said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away , tapping his chin with the cover of the book , in a thoughtful manner ; '
34231	34248	34223	34223	He	4657	' exclaimed the old gentleman , halting very abruptly , and staring up into the sky , '
34264	34322	34341	34341	He	0	' After musing for some minutes , the old gentleman walked , with the same meditative face , into a back anteroom opening from the yard ; and there , retiring into a corner , called up before his mind 's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years . '
34325	34335	34341	34341	He	0	' said the old gentleman , shaking his head ; '
34769	34779	34780	34780	He	0	' That is my name and address , sir . '

35020	35028	35010	35011	Mr. Fang	183	' what 's this fellow charged with ? '
35029	35040	35042	35043	the officer	5322	' He 's not charged at all , your worship , '
35045	35055	35042	35043	the officer	5322	' He appears against this boy , your worship . '
35075	35084	35086	35087	Mr. Fang	183	' Appears against the boy , does he ? '
35098	35102	35090	35091	Mr. Brownlow	125	' Swear him ! '
35103	35117	35119	35120	Mr. Brownlow	125	' Before I am sworn , I must beg to say one word , '
35122	35140	35119	35120	Mr. Brownlow	125	' and that is , that I really never , without actual experience , could have believed - '
35141	35148	35150	35151	Mr. Fang	183	' Hold your tongue , sir ! '
35155	35162	35164	35166	the old gentleman	4702	' I will not , sir ! '

35223	35230	35231	35231	I	0	' said Fang to the clerk . '
35241	35279	35239	35239	him	1152	' Mr. Brownlow 's indignation was greatly roused ; but reflecting perhaps , that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it , he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once . '
35282	35286	35239	35239	him	1152	' said Fang , '

35325	35330	35331	35331	Policeman	1156	' said Mr. Fang . '
35352	35391	35346	35346	policeman	1156	' The policeman , with becoming humility , related how he had taken the charge ; how he had searched Oliver , and found nothing on his person ; and how that was all he knew about it . '
35397	35402	35394	35395	any witnesses	1160	' inquired Mr. Fang . '
35408	35436	35405	35406	your worship	587	' replied the policeman . Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes , and then , turning round to the prosecutor , said in a towering passion . '
35489	35617	35618	35618	He	1164	' By what , or by whom , nobody knows , for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud , just at the right moment ; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor , thus preventing the word from being heard - accidently , of course . With many interruptions , and repeated insults , Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case ; observing that , in the surprise of the moment , he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away ; and expressing his hope that , if the magistrate should believe him , although not actually the thief , to be connected with the thieves , he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow . '
35624	35632	35618	35618	He	1164	' said the old gentleman in conclusion . '
35637	35650	35634	35634	I	0	' he added , with great energy , looking towards the bar , '
35659	35660	35651	35651	I	0	' '
35669	35678	35665	35665	I	0	' said Mr. Fang , with a sneer . '
35701	35727	35698	35698	your	0	' Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him . He was deadly pale ; and the whole place seemed turning round and round . '
35737	35742	35743	35743	Officer	5372	' demanded Mr. Fang . '
35750	35820	35821	35821	He	1164	' This was addressed to a bluff old fellow , in a striped waistcoat , who was standing by the bar . He bent over Oliver , and repeated the inquiry ; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question ; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more , and add to the severity of his sentence ; he hazarded a guess . '
35832	35842	35826	35827	Tom White	184	' said the kind - hearted thief - taker . '
35855	35859	35853	35853	he	1164	' said Fang . '
35871	35872	35874	35874	he	1164	' '
35880	35893	35877	35878	your worship	587	' replied the officer ; again pretending to receive Oliver 's answer . '
35899	35904	35905	35905	He	1164	' inquired Mr. Fang . '
35916	35956	35905	35905	He	1164	' replied the officer : hazarding the usual reply . At this point of the inquiry , Oliver raised his head ; and , looking round with imploring eyes , murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water . '
35961	35966	35905	35905	He	1164	' said Mr. Fang : '
35977	35978	35905	35905	He	1164	' '
35989	35994	35979	35979	I	0	' remonstrated the officer . '
35999	36004	35979	35979	I	0	' said Mr. Fang . '
36012	36023	35979	35979	I	0	' said the old gentleman , raising his hands instinctively ; '

36036	36040	36034	36034	officer	5372	' cried Fang ; '
36048	36084	36085	36085	I	0	' Oliver availed himself of the kind permission , and fell to the floor in a fainting fit . The men in the office looked at each other , but no one dared to stir . '
36091	36105	36085	36085	I	0	' said Fang , as if this were incontestable proof of the fact . '
36119	36120	36085	36085	I	0	' '
36133	36142	36123	36123	you	0	' inquired the clerk in a low voice . '
36145	36150	36123	36123	you	0	' replied Mr. Fang . '
36167	36222	36123	36123	you	0	' The door was opened for this purpose , and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell ; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance , clad in an old suit of black , rushed hastily into the office , and advanced towards the bench . '
36241	36359	36123	36123	you	0	' cried the new comer , breathless with haste . Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this , exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties , the good name , the character , almost the lives , of Her Majesty 's subjects , expecially of the poorer class ; and although , within such walls , enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping ; they are closed to the public , save through the medium of the daily press . Footnote : Or were virtually , then . Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder . '
36377	36382	36383	36383	I	0	' cried Mr. Fang . '
36387	36392	36383	36383	I	0	' cried the man ; '
36440	36464	36466	36467	the man	4928	' The man was right . His manner was determined ; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up . '
36469	36480	36466	36467	the man	4928	' growled Mr. Fang , with a very ill grace . '
36492	36493	36487	36487	you	4928	' '
36496	36501	36487	36487	you	4928	' said the man : '
36556	36588	36546	36547	this boy	4803	' Having by this time recovered a little breath , the worthy book - stall keeper proceeded to relate , in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery . '
36597	36605	36592	36592	you	4928	' said Fang , after a pause . '
36616	36621	36606	36606	I	0	' replied the man . '

36674	36679	36661	36661	he	5392	' replied the man . '

36716	36725	36683	36683	he	5392	' replied the man , with a smile . '
36735	36744	36745	36747	A nice person	1194	' exclaimed the absent old gentleman , innocently . '
36757	36769	36770	36770	I	0	' said Fang , with a comical effort to look humane . '

36870	36875	36877	36878	the magistrate	4680	' Clear the office ! '
36880	36891	36877	36878	the magistrate	4680	' Officers , do you hear ? Clear the office ! '
36981	36988	36990	36991	Mr. Brownlow	125	' Poor boy , poor boy ! '
36997	37008	36990	36991	Mr. Brownlow	125	' Call a coach , somebody , pray . Directly ! '
37036	37042	37044	37048	the book - stall keeper	1206	' May I accompany you ? '
37053	37063	37065	37066	Mr. Brownlow	125	' Bless me , yes , my dear sir , '
37069	37098	37065	37066	Mr. Brownlow	125	' I forgot you . Dear , dear ! I have this unhappy book still ! Jump in . Poor fellow ! There 's no time to lose . '
37370	37383	37385	37385	Oliver	123	' What room is this ? Where have I been brought to ? '
37387	37399	37385	37385	Oliver	123	' This is not the place I went to sleep in . '
37471	37477	37479	37481	the old lady	5061	' Hush , my dear , '
37484	37525	37479	37481	the old lady	5061	' You must be very quiet , or you will be ill again ; and you have been very bad , - as bad as bad could be , pretty nigh . Lie down again ; there 's a dear ! '
37582	37586	37588	37590	the old lady	5061	' Save us ! '
37598	37631	37595	37595	her	5061	' What a grateful little dear it is . Pretty creetur ! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have , and could see him now ! '
37632	37639	37641	37641	Oliver	123	' Perhaps she does see me , '
37648	37664	37641	37641	Oliver	123	' perhaps she has sat by me . I almost feel as if she had . '
37665	37674	37676	37678	the old lady	5061	' That was the fever , my dear , '
37681	37687	37689	37689	Oliver	123	' I suppose it was , '
37691	37754	37756	37756	Oliver	123	' because heaven is a long way off ; and they are too happy there , to come down to the bedside of a poor boy . But if she knew I was ill , she must have pitied me , even there ; for she was very ill herself before she died . She ca n't know anything about me though , '
37763	37795	37756	37756	Oliver	123	' If she had seen me hurt , it would have made her sorrowful ; and her face has always looked sweet and happy , when I have dreamed of her . '
37969	37984	37986	37987	the gentleman	4618	' You are a great deal better , are you not , my dear ? '
37989	37997	37999	37999	Oliver	123	' Yes , thank you , sir , '
38001	38009	38011	38012	the gentleman	4618	' Yes , I know you are , '
38014	38016	38011	38012	the gentleman	4618	' You 're

38029	38033	38034	38034	Hem	156	' answered Oliver . '
38036	38041	38044	38044	I	0	' said the gentleman . '
38047	38058	38060	38061	the gentleman	4618	're not . He is not hungry , Mrs. Bedwin , '
38103	38115	38117	38118	the doctor	5019	' You feel sleepy , do n't you , my dear ? '
38120	38125	38127	38127	Oliver	123	' No , sir , '
38129	38132	38134	38135	the doctor	5019	' No , '
38145	38147	38134	38135	the doctor	5019	' You 're
38157	38158	38161	38161	sir	4564	' '
38166	38170	38161	38161	sir	4564	' answered Oliver . '
38179	38184	38176	38177	Mrs. Bedwin	187	' said the doctor . '
38241	38664	38220	38220	ma'am	4974	' The old lady dropped a curtsey . The doctor , after tasting the cool stuff , and expressing a qualified approval of it , hurried away : his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs . Oliver dozed off again , soon after this ; when he awoke , it was nearly twelve o'clock . The old lady tenderly bade him good - night shortly afterwards , and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come : bringing with her , in a little bundle , a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap . Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table , the old woman , after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him , drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps , chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward , and divers moans and chokings . These , however , had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard , and then fall asleep again . And thus the night crept slowly on . Oliver lay awake for some time , counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight - shade threw upon the ceiling ; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall . The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn ; as they brought into the boy 's mind the thought that death had been hovering there , for many days and nights , and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence , he turned his face upon the pillow , and fervently prayed to Heaven . Gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts ; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from . Who , if this were death , would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life ; to all its cares for the present ; its anxieties for the future ; more than all , its weary recollections of the past ! It had been bright day , for hours , when Oliver opened his eyes ; he felt cheerful and happy . The crisis of the disease was safely past . He belonged to the world again . In three days '
38756	38764	38766	38768	the old lady	5061	' Never mind me , my dear , '
38770	38772	38766	38768	the old lady	5061	' I 'm
38790	38794	38766	38768	the old lady	5061	'm quite comfortable . '
38795	38797	38789	38789	I	0	' You 're
38807	38811	38789	38789	I	0	' said Oliver . '
38822	38828	38815	38815	you	1238	' said the old lady ; '
38885	38941	38880	38880	he	125	' And with this , the old lady applied herself to warming up , in a little saucepan , a basin full of broth : strong enough , Oliver thought , to furnish an ample dinner , when reduced to the regulation strength , for three hundred and fifty paupers , at the lowest computation . '
38950	38981	38943	38943	you	1238	' inquired the old lady , seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes , most intently , on a portrait which hung against the wall ; just opposite his chair . '
38990	39002	38982	38982	I	0	' said Oliver , without taking his eyes from the canvas ; '
39024	39025	39014	39018	a beautiful , mild face	1250	' '
39028	39034	39035	39035	painters	1252	' said the old lady , '
39082	39096	39138	39138	ma'am	4974	' said the old lady , laughing very heartily at her own acuteness . '
39106	39110	39104	39104	ma'am	4974	' said Oliver . '
39113	39128	39104	39104	ma'am	4974	' said the old lady , looking up for a moment from the broth ; '
39134	39135	39138	39138	ma'am	4974	' '
39140	39144	39138	39138	ma'am	4974	' asked Oliver . '
39157	39169	39152	39152	I	0	' answered the old lady in a good - humoured manner . '
39195	39196	39193	39193	dear	769	' '
39202	39206	39193	39193	dear	769	' replied Oliver . '
39211	39217	39219	39221	the old lady	5061	're not afraid of it ? '
39240	39246	39248	39248	Oliver	123	' Oh no , no , '
39251	39276	39278	39278	Oliver	123	' but the eyes look so sorrowful ; and where I sit , they seem fixed upon me . It makes my heart beat , '
39284	39302	39278	39278	Oliver	123	' as if it was alive , and wanted to speak to me , but could n't . '
39303	39308	39310	39312	the old lady	5061	' Lord save us ! '
39316	39327	39310	39312	the old lady	5061	' do n't talk in that way , child . You 're
39356	39369	39310	39312	the old lady	5061	' said the old lady , suiting the action to the word ; '
39381	39483	39370	39370	you	583	' Oliver did see it in his mind 's eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position ; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady ; so he smiled gently when she looked at him ; and Mrs. Bedwin , satisfied that he felt more comfortable , salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth , with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation . Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition . He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful , when there came a soft rap at the door . '
39487	39652	39370	39370	you	583	' said the old lady ; and in walked Mr. Brownlow . Now , the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be ; but , he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead , and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing - gown to take a good long look at Oliver , than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions . Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness , and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up , out of respect to his benefactor , which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again ; and the fact is , if the truth must be told , that Mr. Brownlow 's heart , being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition , forced a supply of tears into his eyes , by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain . '
39659	39668	39370	39370	you	583	' said Mr. Brownlow , clearing his throat . '
39670	39680	39370	39370	you	583	'm rather hoarse this morning , Mrs. Bedwin . I 'm
39687	39688	39689	39689	I	0	' '
39695	39700	39689	39689	I	0	' said Mrs. Bedwin . '
39713	39714	39711	39711	sir	4564	' '
39727	39732	39722	39722	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow ; '
39760	39761	39754	39754	you	4564	' '
39767	39771	39765	39765	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . '
39785	39786	39777	39777	sir	4564	' '
39790	39797	39777	39777	sir	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow , stoutly . '
39812	39813	39814	39814	He	4564	' '
39827	39865	39825	39825	sir	4564	' replied Mrs. Bedwin : drawing herself up slightly , and laying strong emphasis on the last word : to intimate that between slops , and broth will compounded , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever . '
39868	39878	39825	39825	sir	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow , with a slight shudder ; '
39905	39906	39900	39901	Tom White	184	' '
39914	39927	39928	39928	Oliver	123	' replied the little invalid : with a look of great astonishment . '
39930	39935	39936	39936	Oliver	123	' said Mr. Brownlow ; '
39944	39945	39939	39940	Oliver White	188	' '
39955	39956	39950	39950	Twist	123	' '
39960	39966	39950	39950	Twist	123	' said the old gentleman . '
39978	39979	39969	39969	you	0	' '
39988	40033	39986	39986	sir	4564	' returned Oliver in amazement . This sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver 's face . It was impossible to doubt him ; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments . '
40037	40083	39986	39986	sir	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow . But , although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed , the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly , that he could not withdraw his gaze . '
40095	40104	40086	40086	you	4564	' said Oliver , raising his eyes beseechingly . '
40109	40115	40086	40086	you	4564	' replied the old gentleman . '
40127	40865	40122	40122	Bedwin	187	' As he spoke , he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver 's head , and then to the boy 's face . There was its living copy . The eyes , the head , the mouth ; every feature was the same . The expression was , for the instant , so precisely alike , that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy ! Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation ; for , not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him , he fainted away . A weakness on his part , which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense , in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman ; and of recording - That when the Dodger , and his accomplished friend Master Bates , joined in the hue - and - cry which was raised at Oliver 's heels , in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow 's personal property , as has been already described , they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves ; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true - hearted Englishman , so , I need hardly beg the reader to observe , that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men , in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound - judging philosophers have laid down as the main - springs of all Nature 's deeds and actions : the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady 's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory : and , by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding , putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart , or generous impulse and feeling . For , these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex . If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament , I should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative , of their quitting the pursuit , when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver ; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut . Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages , to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance , by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings , like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas , are prone to indulge ; still , I do mean to say , and do say distinctly , that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers , in carrying out their theories , to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves . Thus , to do a great right , you may do a little wrong ; and you may take any means which the end to be attained , will justify ; the amount of the right , or the amount of the wrong , or indeed the distinction between the two , being left entirely to the philosopher concerned , to be settled and determined by his clear , comprehensive , and impartial view of his own particular case . It was not until the two boys had scoured , with great rapidity , through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts , that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway . Having remained silent here , just long enough to recover breath to speak , Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight ; and , bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter , flung himself upon a doorstep , and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth .

40883	40888	40122	40122	Bedwin	187	' roared Charley Bates . '
40893	40902	40122	40122	Bedwin	187	' remonstrated the Dodger , looking cautiously round . '
40912	40913	40914	40914	I	0	' '
40920	40924	40925	40925	I	0	' said Charley , '

41028	41034	41036	41037	the Dodger	5121	' What 'll Fagin say ? '
41058	41061	41063	41064	Charley Bates	179	' What ? '
41066	41071	41073	41074	the Dodger	5121	' Ah , what ? '
41076	41084	41086	41086	Charley	179	' Why , what should he say ? '
41103	41109	41096	41097	the Dodger	176	' What should he say ? '
41134	41140	41142	41142	Charley	179	' What do you mean ? '
41144	41164	41166	41167	the Dodger	5121	' Toor rul lol loo , gammon and spinnage , the frog he would n't , and high cockolorum , '
41196	41202	41203	41204	The Dodger	176	' What do you mean ? '
41367	41374	41376	41380	the Jew : changing countenance	1286	' Why , how 's this ? '
41382	41386	41376	41380	the Jew : changing countenance	1286	' only two of 'em
41403	41458	41461	41461	Oliver	123	' The footsteps approached nearer ; they reached the landing . The door was slowly opened ; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered , closing it behind them . CHAPTER XIII SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER , CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED , APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY '
41463	41474	41461	41461	Oliver	123	' said the Jew , rising with a menacing look . '
41480	41509	41477	41478	the boy	437	' The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence ; and looked uneasily at each other . But they made no reply . '
41517	41537	41461	41461	Oliver	123	' said the Jew , seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar , and threatening him with horrid imprecations . '
41547	41622	41542	41542	I	0	' Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest , that Charley Bates , who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side , and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second , dropped upon his knees , and raised a loud , well - sustained , and continuous roar - something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet . '
41627	41651	41624	41624	you	437	' thundered the Jew : shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all , seemed perfectly miraculous . '
41667	41674	41542	41542	I	0	' said the Dodger , sullenly . '
41680	41686	41690	41690	himself	437	' me , will you ! '
41828	41840	41813	41813	he	179	' Why , what the blazes is in the wind now ! '
41846	41850	41813	41813	he	179	' Who pitched that '
41968	42108	42143	42145	this engaging ruffian	1301	' The man who growled out these words , was a stoutly - built fellow of about five - and - thirty , in a black velveteen coat , very soiled drab breeches , lace - up half boots , and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs , with large swelling calves ; - the kind of legs , which in such costume , always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them . He had a brown hat on his head , and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck : with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke . He disclosed , when he had done so , a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days '
42134	42141	42143	42145	this engaging ruffian	1301	' Come in , d'ye hear ? '
42168	42177	42179	42180	the man	4928	' Why did n't you come in afore ? '
42182	42184	42195	42195	you	0	' You 're
42200	42272	42275	42275	you	4928	' This command was accompanied with a kick , which sent the animal to the other end of the room . He appeared well used to it , however ; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly , without uttering a sound , and winking his very ill - looking eyes twenty times in a minute , appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment . '
42302	42311	42312	42312	I	0	' said the man , seating himself deliberately . '
42332	42357	42376	42376	they	486	' prentice , I 'd have done it long ago , and - no , I could n't have sold you afterwards , for you 're
42385	42386	42376	42376	they	486	' '
42394	42401	42391	42392	Mr. Sikes	161	' said the Jew , trembling ; '
42408	42409	42391	42392	Mr. Sikes	161	' '
42415	42420	42391	42392	Mr. Sikes	161	' replied the ruffian ; '
42449	42450	42439	42439	I	0	' '
42460	42469	42457	42458	Bill Sikes	161	' said the Jew , with abject humility . '
42478	42479	42476	42476	Bill	161	' '
42484	42488	42481	42481	I	0	' replied Sikes ; '
42521	42522	42514	42514	you	161	' '
42527	42617	42524	42524	you	161	' said the Jew , catching the man by the sleeve , and pointing towards the boys . Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear , and jerking his head over on the right shoulder ; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly . He then , in ca nt terms , with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled , but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here , demanded a glass of liquor . '
42626	42767	42768	42768	I	0	' said Mr. Sikes , laying his hat upon the table . This was said in jest ; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard , he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary , or the wish at all events to improve upon the distiller 's ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman 's merry heart . After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits , Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen ; which gracious act led to a conversation , in which the cause and manner of Oliver 's capture were circumstantially detailed , with such alterations and improvements on the truth , as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances . '
42769	42772	42774	42775	the Jew	1006	'm afraid , '
42777	42790	42774	42775	the Jew	1006	' that he may say something which will get us into trouble . '
42791	42797	42799	42799	Sikes	161	' That 's very likely , '
42805	42807	42799	42799	Sikes	161	' You 're
42813	42814	42811	42811	Fagin	174	' '
42817	42823	42831	42831	he	0	'm afraid , you see , '
42849	42851	42844	42844	he	0	' I 'm
42892	42987	42988	42988	Somebody	5443	' The man started , and turned round upon the Jew . But the old gentleman 's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears ; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall . There was a long pause . Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections ; not excepting the dog , who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out . '
43000	43023	42988	42988	Somebody	5443	' said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in . The Jew nodded assent . '
43044	43049	43039	43039	he	1314	' said Mr. Sikes , '
43067	43219	43059	43059	You	1315	' Again the Jew nodded . The prudence of this line of action , indeed , was obvious ; but , unfortunately , there was one very strong objection to its being adopted . This was , that the Dodger , and Charley Bates , and Fagin , and Mr. William Sikes , happened , one and all , to entertain a violent and deeply - rooted antipathy to going near a police - office on any ground or pretext whatever . How long they might have sat and looked at each other , in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind , it is difficult to guess . It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject , however ; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion , caused the conversation to flow afresh . '
43224	43229	43059	43059	You	1315	' said the Jew . '
43241	43242	43236	43236	you	1315	' '
43246	43252	43236	43236	you	1315	' inquired the young lady . '
43263	43301	43236	43236	you	1315	' said the Jew coaxingly . It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not , but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be '
43303	43394	43395	43395	Nancy	127	' if she would ; a polite and delicate evasion of the request , which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which can not bear to inflict upon a fellow - creature , the pain of a direct and pointed refusal . The Jew 's countenance fell . He turned from this young lady , who was gaily , not to say gorgeously attired , in a red gown , green boots , and yellow curl - papers , to the other female . '
43400	43409	43395	43395	Nancy	127	' said the Jew in a soothing manner , '
43415	43416	43412	43412	YOU	127	' '
43436	43440	43434	43434	Fagin	174	' replied Nancy . '
43448	43460	43443	43443	you	127	' said Mr. Sikes , looking up in a surly manner . '
43467	43473	43462	43462	I	0	' replied the lady collectedly . '
43477	43485	43476	43476	you	127	're just the very person for it , '
43490	43499	43476	43476	you	127	' nobody about here knows anything of you . '
43500	43507	43462	43462	I	0	' And as I do n't want 'em
43512	43521	43476	43476	you	127	' replied Nancy in the same composed manner , '
43534	43535	43532	43532	Bill	161	' '
43542	43546	43540	43540	Fagin	174	' said Sikes . '
43555	43559	43553	43553	Fagin	174	' said Nancy . '
43567	43703	43565	43565	Fagin	174	' said Sikes . And Mr. Sikes was right . By dint of alternate threats , promises , and bribes , the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission . She was not , indeed , withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend ; for , having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe , she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances . Accordingly , with a clean white apron tied over her gown , and her curl - papers tucked up under a straw bonnet , - both articles of dress being provided from the Jew 's inexhaustible stock , - Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand . '
43711	43723	43565	43565	Fagin	174	' said the Jew , producing , a little covered basket . '
43738	43739	43753	43753	Fagin	174	' '
43755	43759	43753	43753	Fagin	174	' said Sikes ; '
43767	43768	43753	43753	Fagin	174	' '
43780	43803	43753	43753	Fagin	174	' said the Jew , hanging a large street - door key on the forefinger of the young lady 's right hand . '
43816	43825	43828	43829	my brother	1324	' said the Jew , rubbing his hands . '
43842	43867	43828	43829	my brother	1324	' exclaimed Nancy , bursting into tears , and wringing the little basket and the street - door key in an agony of distress . '
43911	43950	43909	43909	gentlemen	1328	' Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart - broken tone : to the immeasurable delight of her hearers : Miss Nancy paused , winked to the company , nodded smilingly round , and disappeared . '
43962	43997	43953	43953	she	1327	' said the Jew , turning round to his young friends , and shaking his head gravely , as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld . '
44006	44024	43998	43998	She	1327	' said Mr. Sikes , filling his glass , and smiting the table with his enormous fist . '
44038	44141	43998	43998	She	1327	' While these , and many other encomiums , were being passed on the accomplished Nancy , that young lady made the best of her way to the police - office ; whither , notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected , she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards . Entering by the back way , she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell - doors , and listened . There was no sound within : so she coughed and listened again . Still there was no reply : so she spoke . '
44146	44154	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' murmured Nancy in a gentle voice ; '
44157	44277	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal , who had been taken up for playing the flute , and who , the offence against society having been clearly proved , had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month ; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare , it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument . He made no answer : being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute , which had been confiscated for the use of the county : so Nancy passed on to the next cell , and knocked there . '
44280	44288	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' cried a faint and feeble voice . '
44296	44305	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' inquired Nancy , with a preliminary sob . '
44308	44313	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' replied the voice ; '
44317	44462	44155	44155	Nolly	123	' This was a vagrant of sixty - five , who was going to prison for not playing the flute ; or , in other words , for begging in the streets , and doing nothing for his livelihood . In the next cell was another man , who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license ; thereby doing something for his living , in defiance of the Stamp - office . But , as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver , or knew anything about him , Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat ; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations , rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street - door key and the little basket , demanded her own dear brother . '
44472	44478	44463	44463	I	0	' said the old man . '
44483	44492	44495	44496	the gentleman	4618	' screamed Nancy , in a distracted manner . '
44501	44506	44507	44508	What gentleman	1338	' replied the officer . '
44518	44718	44515	44516	What gentleman	1338	' exclaimed Nancy . In reply to this incoherent questioning , the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy , not in custody ; and that the prosecutor had carried him away , in an insensible condition , to his own residence : of and concerning which , all the informant knew was , that it was somewhere in Pentonville , he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman . In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty , the agonised young woman staggered to the gate , and then , exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run , returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of , to the domicile of the Jew . Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered , than he very hastily called up the white dog , and , putting on his hat , expeditiously departed : without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good - morning . '
44734	44741	44742	44742	Charley	179	' said the Jew greatly excited . '
44791	44804	44822	44822	You	127	' added the Jew , unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand ; '
44844	44910	44841	44842	my dears	1046	' With these words , he pushed them from the room : and carefully double - locking and barring the door behind them , drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver . Then , he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing . A rap at the door startled him in this occupation . '
44915	44923	44924	44924	Me	0	' he cried in a shrill tone . '
44926	44940	44924	44924	Me	0	' replied the voice of the Dodger , through the key - hole . '
44944	44950	44924	44924	Me	0	' cried the Jew impatiently . '
44964	44969	44961	44961	Nancy	127	' inquired the Dodger . '
44972	44977	44979	44979	she	127	' replied the Jew , '
45007	45023	45024	45024	He	1350	' The boy murmured a reply of intelligence : and hurried downstairs after his companions . '
45031	45041	45024	45024	He	1350	' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation . '
45060	45068	45071	45073	MR . BROWNLOW	125	' CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER 'S
45074	45230	45071	45073	MR . BROWNLOW	125	'S , WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR . GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM , WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND Oliver soon recovering from the fainting - fit into which Mr. Brownlow 's abrupt exclamation had thrown him , the subject of the picture was carefully avoided , both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin , in the conversation that ensued : which indeed bore no reference to Oliver 's history or prospects , but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him . He was still too weak to get up to breakfast ; but , when he came down into the housekeeper 's room next day , his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall , in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady . His expectations were disappointed , however , for the picture had been removed . '
45233	45246	45071	45073	MR . BROWNLOW	125	' said the housekeeper , watching the direction of Oliver 's eyes . '
45254	45255	45251	45251	you	1354	' '
45262	45266	45256	45256	I	0	' replied Oliver . '
45274	45275	45269	45269	they	1356	' '
45308	45314	45305	45305	you	1254	' rejoined the old lady . '
45329	45333	45327	45327	ma'am	4974	' said Oliver . '
45345	45346	45340	45340	I	0	' '
45351	45361	45340	45340	I	0	' said the old lady , good - humouredly ; '
45398	45923	45392	45392	us	1360	' This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time . As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness , he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then ; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him , about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers , who was married to an amiable and handsome man , and lived in the country ; and about a son , who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies ; and who was , also , such a good young man , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a - year , that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them . When the old lady had expatiated , a long time , on the excellences of her children , and the merits of her kind good husband besides , who had been dead and gone , poor dear soul ! just six - and - twenty years , it was time to have tea . After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage : which he learnt as quickly as she could teach : and at which game they played , with great interest and gravity , until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water , with a slice of dry toast , and then to go cosily to bed . They were happy days , those of Oliver 's recovery . Everything was so quiet , and neat , and orderly ; everybody so kind and gentle ; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived , it seemed like Heaven itself . He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on , properly , than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit , and a new cap , and a new pair of shoes , to be provided for him . As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes , he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him , and asked her to sell them to a Jew , and keep the money for herself . This she very readily did ; and , as Oliver looked out of the parlour window , and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away , he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone , and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again . They were sad rags , to tell the truth ; and Oliver had never had a new suit before . One evening , about a week after the affair of the picture , as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin , there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow , that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well , he should like to see him in his study , and talk to him a little while . '
45947	45952	45937	45937	me	0	' said Mrs. Bedwin . '
45986	46221	45968	45968	we	1361	' Oliver did as the old lady bade him ; and , although she lamented grievously , meanwhile , that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt - collar ; he looked so delicate and handsome , despite that important personal advantage , that she went so far as to say : looking at him with great complacency from head to foot , that she really did n't think it would have been possible , on the longest notice , to have made much difference in him for the better . Thus encouraged , Oliver tapped at the study door . On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in , he found himself in a little back room , quite full of books , with a window , looking into some pleasant little gardens . There was a table drawn up before the window , at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading . When he saw Oliver , he pushed the book away from him , and told him to come near the table , and sit down . Oliver complied ; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser . Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist , every day of their lives . '
46236	46259	46264	46264	sir	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow , observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling . '
46266	46270	46264	46264	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . '
46277	46278	46264	46264	sir	4564	' '
46289	46296	46264	46264	sir	4564	' said the old gentleman kindly ; '
46334	46335	46336	46336	I	0	' '
46346	46366	46344	46344	sir	4564	' said Oliver , pointing to some large quartos , with a good deal of gilding about the binding . '
46371	46390	46344	46344	sir	4564	' said the old gentleman , patting Oliver on the head , and smiling as he did so ; '
46422	46423	46424	46424	I	0	' '
46434	46438	46426	46426	I	0	' replied Oliver . '
46452	46522	46443	46443	you	601	' said the old gentleman . Oliver considered a little while ; and at last said , he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book - seller ; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily , and declared he had said a very good thing . Which Oliver felt glad to have done , though he by no means knew what it was . '
46527	46537	46443	46443	you	601	' said the old gentleman , composing his features . '
46570	46571	46575	46575	sir	4564	' '
46577	46616	46575	46575	sir	4564	' said Oliver . At the earnest manner of his reply , the old gentleman laughed again ; and said something about a curious instinct , which Oliver , not understanding , paid no very great attention to . '
46619	46652	46653	46653	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , speaking if possible in a kinder , but at the same time in a much more serious manner , than Oliver had ever known him assume yet , '
46700	46701	46707	46707	you	4564	' '
46719	46735	46707	46707	you	4564	' exclaimed Oliver , alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman 's commencement ! '
46782	46783	46780	46780	sir	4564	' '
46788	46804	46780	46780	sir	4564	' said the old gentleman , moved by the warmth of Oliver 's sudden appeal ; '
46821	46822	46816	46816	you	1383	' '
46831	46835	46823	46823	I	0	' interposed Oliver . '
46840	46846	46836	46836	I	0	' rejoined the old gentleman . '
46965	47001	47044	47044	you	1383	' As the old gentleman said this in a low voice : more to himself than to his companion : and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards : Oliver sat quite still . '
47006	47020	47044	47044	you	1383	' said the old gentleman at length , in a more cheerful tone , '
47129	47195	47197	47197	he	1391	' Oliver 's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes ; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm , and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble , a peculiarly impatient little double - knock was heard at the street - door : and the servant , running upstairs , announced Mr. Grimwig . '
47201	47206	47209	47209	sir	4564	' inquired Mr. Brownlow . '
47211	47216	47217	47217	He	1391	' replied the servant . '
47244	47296	47236	47236	he	1391	' Mr. Brownlow smiled ; and , turning to Oliver , said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his , and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners ; for he was a worthy creature at bottom , as he had reason to know . '
47304	47308	47302	47302	sir	4564	' inquired Oliver . '
47311	47316	47302	47302	sir	4564	' replied Mr. Brownlow , '
47324	47532	47236	47236	he	1391	' At this moment , there walked into the room : supporting himself by a thick stick : a stout old gentleman , rather lame in one leg , who was dressed in a blue coat , striped waistcoat , nankeen breeches and gaiters , and a broad - brimmed white hat , with the sides turned up with green . A very small - plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat ; and a very long steel watch - chain , with nothing but a key at the end , dangled loosely below it . The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange ; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted , defy description . He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke ; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time : which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot . In this attitude , he fixed himself , the moment he made his appearance ; and , holding out a small piece of orange - peel at arm 's length , exclaimed , in a growling , discontented voice . '
47609	47725	47726	47726	I	0	' This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made ; and it was the more singular in his case , because , even admitting for the sake of argument , the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed , Mr. Grimwig 's head was such a particularly large one , that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting - to put entirely out of the question , a very thick coating of powder . '
47734	47746	47726	47726	I	0	' repeated Mr. Grimwig , striking his stick upon the ground . '
47753	47765	47726	47726	I	0	' looking at Oliver , and retreating a pace or two . '
47778	47786	47769	47770	Oliver Twist	123	' said Mr. Brownlow . Oliver bowed . '
47805	47815	47802	47802	I	0	' said Mr. Grimwig , recoiling a little more . '
47826	47846	47849	47854	the boy who had the orange	1405	' continued Mr. Grimwig , abruptly , losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery ; '
47890	47891	47880	47880	I	0	' '
47902	47909	47880	47880	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , laughing . '
47924	47925	47926	47926	I	0	' '
47935	47947	47926	47926	I	0	' said the irritable old gentleman , drawing off his gloves . '
48053	48149	48025	48025	I	0	' Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick ; which was always understood , by his friends , to imply the customary offer , whenever it was not expressed in words . Then , still keeping his stick in his hand , he sat down ; and , opening a double eye - glass , which he wore attached to a broad black riband , took a view of Oliver : who , seeing that he was the object of inspection , coloured , and bowed again . '
48158	48166	48025	48025	I	0	' said Mr. Grimwig , at length . '
48172	48177	48169	48170	the boy	437	' replied Mr. Brownlow . '
48184	48189	48182	48182	boy	4619	' said Mr. Grimwig . '
48200	48256	48198	48198	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . Mr. Brownlow , seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable , asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea ; which , as he did not half like the visitor 's manner , he was very happy to do . '
48269	48274	48275	48275	I	0	' inquired Mr. Brownlow . '
48280	48287	48275	48275	I	0	' replied Mr. Grimwig , pettishly . '
48292	48293	48275	48275	I	0	' '
48326	48327	48321	48324	beef - faced boys	1426	' '
48333	48334	48335	48335	Mealy	193	' '
48414	48415	48411	48412	The wretch	1433	' '
48418	48423	48411	48412	The wretch	1433	' said Mr. Brownlow , '
48442	48443	48444	48444	They	1434	' '
48448	48453	48444	48444	They	1434	' replied Mr. Grimwig . '
48459	48478	48454	48454	He	123	' Here , Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently ; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight . '
48487	48492	48484	48484	I	0	' repeated Mr. Grimwig . '
48576	48846	48536	48536	they	1435	' Now , the fact was , that in the inmost recesses of his own heart , Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver 's appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing ; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction , sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange - peel ; and , inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well - looking or not , he had resolved , from the first , to oppose his friend . When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer ; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver 's previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it ; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously . And he demanded , with a sneer , whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night ; because if she did n't find a table - spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning , why , he would be content to - and so forth . All this , Mr. Brownlow , although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman : knowing his friend 's peculiarities , bore with great good humour ; as Mr. Grimwig , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly ; and Oliver , who made one of the party , began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman 's presence . '
48871	48896	48850	48850	you	1439	' asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow , at the conclusion of the meal ; looking sideways at Oliver , as he resumed his subject . '
48902	48907	48850	48850	you	1439	' replied Mr. Brownlow . '
48935	48936	48939	48939	sir	4564	' '
48941	48965	48939	48939	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . He answered with some hesitation , because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig 's looking so hard at him . '
48972	48980	48981	48981	he	123	' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow ; '
49007	49008	48998	48998	He	123	' '
49016	49023	49009	49009	I	0	' replied Mr. Brownlow , warmly . '
49029	49034	49035	49035	I	0	' said Mr. Grimwig , '
49038	49045	49046	49046	I	0	' and down went the stick . '
49058	49067	49069	49069	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , knocking the table . '
49077	49087	49074	49074	my	0	' rejoined Mr. Grimwig , knocking the table also . '
49092	49102	49103	49103	We	1444	' said Mr. Brownlow , checking his rising anger . '
49106	49116	49117	49117	we	1444	' replied Mr. Grimwig , with a provoking smile ; '
49120	49180	49117	49117	we	1444	' As fate would have it , Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in , at this moment , a small parcel of books , which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall - keeper , who has already figured in this history ; having laid them on the table , she prepared to leave the room . '
49188	49193	49185	49186	Mrs. Bedwin	187	' said Mr. Brownlow ; '
49201	49202	49203	49203	He	437	' '
49209	49214	49217	49217	him	437	' replied Mrs. Bedwin . '
49219	49224	49217	49217	him	437	' said Mr. Brownlow ; '
49253	49314	49316	49316	me	0	' The street - door was opened . Oliver ran one way ; and the girl ran another ; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy ; but there was no boy in sight . Oliver and the girl returned , in a breathless state , to report that there were no tidings of him . '
49325	49330	49318	49318	I	0	' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow ; '
49343	49344	49331	49331	I	0	' '
49350	49360	49331	49331	I	0	' said Mr. Grimwig , with an ironical smile ; '
49373	49374	49331	49331	I	0	' '
49389	49393	49384	49384	you	0	' said Oliver . '
49403	49467	49394	49394	I	0	' The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account ; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should ; and that , by his prompt discharge of the commission , he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions : on this head at least : at once . '
49475	49481	49468	49468	You	0	' said the old gentleman . '
49496	49533	49534	49534	You	0	' Oliver , delighted to be of use , brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle ; and waited , cap in hand , to hear what message he was to take . '
49539	49549	49550	49550	you	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , glancing steadily at Grimwig ; '
49598	49599	49600	49600	I	0	' '
49609	49711	49600	49600	I	0	' said Oliver , eagerly . Having buttoned up the bank - note in his jacket pocket , and placed the books carefully under his arm , he made a respectful bow , and left the room . Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street - door , giving him many directions about the nearest way , and the name of the bookseller , and the name of the street : all of which Oliver said he clearly understood . Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold , the old lady at length permitted him to depart . '
49717	49727	49728	49728	I	0	' said the old lady , looking after him . '
49744	49783	49728	49728	I	0	' At this moment , Oliver looked gaily round , and nodded before he turned the corner . The old lady smilingly returned his salutation , and , closing the door , went back to her own room . '
49800	49817	49788	49788	he	1451	' said Mr. Brownlow , pulling out his watch , and placing it on the table . '
49826	49827	49788	49788	he	1451	' '
49841	49846	49830	49830	you	1453	' inquired Mr. Grimwig . '
49851	49886	49830	49830	you	1453	' asked Mr. Brownlow , smiling . The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig 's breast , at the moment ; and it was rendered stronger by his friend 's confident smile . '
49889	49900	49901	49901	I	0	' he said , smiting the table with his fist , '
49967	50309	49961	49961	I	0	' With these words he drew his chair closer to the table ; and there the two friends sat , in silent expectation , with the watch between them . It is worthy of remark , as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments , and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions , that , although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad - hearted man , and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived , he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment , that Oliver Twist might not come back . It grew so dark , that the figures on the dial - plate were scarcely discernible ; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit , in silence , with the watch between them . CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST , THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE In the obscure parlour of a low public - house , in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill ; a dark and gloomy den , where a flaring gas - light burnt all day in the winter - time ; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer : there sat , brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass , strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor , a man in a velveteen coat , drab shorts , half - boots and stockings , whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes . At his feet , sat a white - coated , red - eyed dog ; who occupied himself , alternately , in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time ; and in licking a large , fresh cut on one side of his mouth , which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict . '
50319	50492	50497	50497	you	1460	' said Mr. Sikes , suddenly breaking silence . Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog 's winking , or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them , is matter for argument and consideration . Whatever was the cause , the effect was a kick and a curse , bestowed upon the dog simultaneously . Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters ; but Mr. Sikes 's dog , having faults of temper in common with his owner , and labouring , perhaps , at this moment , under a powerful sense of injury , made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half - boots . Having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form ; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head . '
50499	50529	50497	50497	you	1460	' said Sikes , seizing the poker in one hand , and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp - knife , which he drew from his pocket . '
50543	50751	50756	50756	you	1460	' The dog no doubt heard ; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice ; but , appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut , he remained where he was , and growled more fiercely than before : at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth , and biting at it like a wild beast . This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more ; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously . The dog jumped from right to left , and from left to right ; snapping , growling , and barking ; the man thrust and swore , and struck and blasphemed ; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other ; when , the door suddenly opening , the dog darted out : leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp - knife in his hands . There must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage . Mr. Sikes , being disappointed of the dog 's participation , at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer . '
50766	50775	50756	50756	you	1460	' said Sikes , with a fierce gesture . '
50789	50803	50784	50784	I	0	' replied Fagin , humbly ; for the Jew was the new comer . '
50814	50818	50808	50812	you white - livered thief	1463	' growled Sikes . '
50826	50827	50821	50821	you	1460	' '
50836	50843	50845	50846	the Jew	1006	'm a living man , Bill , '
50848	50860	50862	50862	Sikes	129	' Oh no ! You hear nothing , you do n't , '
50868	50899	50862	50862	Sikes	129	' Sneaking in and out , so as nobody hears how you come or go ! I wish you had been the dog , Fagin , half a minute ago . '
50900	50903	50905	50906	the Jew	1006	' Why ? '
50912	50946	50948	50948	Sikes	129	'Cause the government , as cares for the lives of such men as you , as have n't half the pluck of curs , lets a man kill a dog how he likes , '
50960	50965	50948	50948	Sikes	129	' that 's why . '
51000	51004	51006	51006	Sikes	129	' Grin away , '
51019	51078	51006	51006	Sikes	129	' grin away . You 'll never have the laugh at me , though , unless it 's behind a nightcap . I 've got the upper hand over you , Fagin ; and , d - me , I 'll keep it . There ! If I go , you go ; so take care of me . '
51079	51087	51089	51090	the Jew	1006	' Well , well , my dear , '
51092	51114	51089	51090	the Jew	1006	' I know all that ; we - we - have a mutual interest , Bill , - a mutual interest . '
51115	51118	51120	51120	Sikes	161	' Humph , '
51140	51152	51124	51124	he	161	' Well , what have you got to say to me ? '
51153	51165	51167	51167	Fagin	174	' It 's all passed safe through the melting - pot , '
51169	51205	51167	51167	Fagin	174	' and this is your share . It 's rather more than it ought to be , my dear ; but as I know you 'll do me a good turn another time , and - '
51206	51211	51213	51214	the robber	1469	' Stow that gammon , '
51218	51226	51213	51214	the robber	1469	' Where is it ? Hand over ! '
51227	51242	51244	51245	the Jew	1006	' Yes , yes , Bill ; give me time , give me time , '
51249	51257	51244	51245	the Jew	1006	' Here it is ! All safe ! '
51310	51318	51320	51320	Sikes	161	' This is all , is it ? '
51322	51325	51327	51328	the Jew	1006	' All , '
51330	51350	51352	51352	Sikes	161	' You have n't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along , have you ? '
51356	51380	51352	51352	Sikes	161	' Do n't put on an injured look at the question ; you 've done it many a time . Jerk the tinkler . '
51532	51539	51541	51541	Fagin	174	' Is anybody here , Barney ? '
51561	51566	51568	51568	Barney	195	' Dot a shoul , '
51589	51592	51594	51594	Fagin	174	' Nobody ? '
51616	51622	51624	51624	Barney	195	' Dobody but Biss Dadsy , '
51626	51629	51631	51631	Sikes	161	' Nancy ! '
51633	51646	51631	51631	Sikes	161	' Where ? Strike me blind , if I do n't honour that '
51655	51656	51631	51631	Sikes	161	' '
51671	51675	51657	51657	She	1475	' replied Barney . '
51680	51691	51657	51657	She	1475	' said Sikes , pouring out a glass of liquor . '
51696	51752	51753	51753	You	1475	' Barney looked timidly at Fagin , as if for permission ; the Jew remaining silent , and not lifting his eyes from the ground , he retired ; and presently returned , ushering in Nancy ; who was decorated with the bonnet , apron , basket , and street - door key , complete . '
51764	51772	51762	51762	Nancy	127	' inquired Sikes , proffering the glass . '
51780	51791	51775	51775	I	0	' replied the young lady , disposing of its contents ; '
51816	51817	51820	51820	Nancy	127	' '
51824	51918	51820	51820	Nancy	127	' said Fagin , looking up . Now , whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew 's red eye - brows , and a half closing of his deeply - set eyes , warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative , is not a matter of much importance . The fact is all we need care for here ; and the fact is , that she suddenly checked herself , and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes , turned the conversation to other matters . In about ten minutes '
52241	52248	52233	52235	a young woman	339	' Oh , my dear brother ! '
52279	52283	52285	52285	Oliver	123	' Do n't , '
52289	52306	52285	52285	Oliver	123	' Let go of me . Who is it ? What are you stopping me for ? '
52345	52350	52352	52354	the young woman	341	' Oh my gracious ! '
52356	52407	52352	52354	the young woman	341	' I have found him ! Oh ! Oliver ! Oliver ! Oh you naughty boy , to make me suffer such distress on your account ! Come home , dear , come . Oh , I 've found him . Thank gracious goodness heavins , I 've found him ! '
52501	52511	52513	52515	the young woman	341	' Oh , no , no , never mind , '
52522	52524	52513	52515	the young woman	341	' I 'm

52544	52550	52542	52542	ma'am	4974	' replied the young woman , '
52593	52594	52595	52596	Young wretch	1507	' '
52598	52603	52595	52596	Young wretch	1507	' said one woman . '
52613	52618	52609	52609	you	123	' said the other . '
52623	52630	52631	52631	I	0	' replied Oliver , greatly alarmed . '
52650	52659	52673	52675	the young woman	341	'm an orphan ; I live at Pentonville . '
52660	52671	52673	52675	the young woman	341	' Only hear him , how he braves it out ! '
52677	52684	52686	52686	Oliver	123	' Why , it 's Nancy ! '
52706	52713	52715	52715	Nancy	127	' You see he knows me ! '
52722	52754	52715	52715	Nancy	127	' He ca n't help himself . Make him come home , there 's good people , or he 'll kill his dear mother and father , and break my heart ! '
52755	52762	52764	52765	a man	469	' What the devil 's this ? '
52783	52802	52764	52765	a man	469	' young Oliver ! Come home to your poor mother , you young dog ! Come home directly . '
52803	52821	52823	52823	Oliver	123	' I do n't belong to them . I do n't know them . Help ! help ! '
52833	52836	52838	52839	the man	4928	' Help ! '
52841	52863	52866	52866	you	123	' Yes ; I 'll help you , you young rascal ! What books are these ? You 've been a stealing 'em
52869	52872	52877	52878	the man	4928	'em here . '
52893	52898	52900	52903	a looker - on	1519	' That 's right ! '
52911	52924	52900	52903	a looker - on	1519	' That 's the only way of bringing him to his senses ! '
52925	52930	52932	52936	a sleepy - faced carpenter	1520	' To be sure ! '
52948	52955	52957	52959	the two women	1521	' It 'll do him good ! '
52961	52970	52972	52973	the man	4928	' And he shall have it , too ! '
52986	53008	52972	52973	the man	4928	' Come on , you young villain ! Here , Bull's - eye , mind him , boy ! Mind him ! '
53309	53314	53316	53316	Sikes	161	' Do you hear ? '
53369	53375	53377	53377	Sikes	161	' Give me the other , '
53385	53392	53377	53377	Sikes	161	' Here , Bull's - Eye ! '
53401	53407	53409	53409	Sikes	161	' See here , boy ! '
53420	53436	53409	53409	Sikes	161	' if he speaks ever so soft a word , hold him ! D'ye mind ! '
53463	53480	53482	53482	Sikes	161	' He 's as willing as a Christian , strike me blind if he is n't ! '
53496	53532	53537	53537	his	161	' Now , you know what you 've got to expect , master , so call away as quick as you like ; the dog will soon stop that game . Get on , young'un ! '
53686	53689	53692	53692	Bill	161	' Eight o '
53694	53703	53692	53692	Bill	161	' said Nancy , when the bell ceased . '
53722	53726	53727	53727	I	0	' replied Sikes . '
53735	53739	53730	53730	THEY	1542	' said Nancy . '
53745	53749	53742	53742	they	1542	' replied Sikes . '
53817	53818	53819	53820	Poor fellow	863	' '
53822	53842	53819	53820	Poor fellow	863	' said Nancy , who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded . '
53854	53855	53845	53845	Bill	161	' '
53866	53870	53871	53873	Fine young chaps	1549	' answered Sikes . '
53878	53891	53877	53877	they	1549	're as good as dead , so it do n't much matter . '
53923	53928	53930	53931	the girl	5742	' Wait a minute ! '
53933	53991	53930	53931	the girl	5742	' I would n't hurry by , if it was you that was coming out to be hung , the next time eight o'clock struck , Bill . I 'd walk round and round the place till I dropped , if the snow was on the ground , and I had n't a shawl to cover me . '
53992	54000	54002	54005	the unsentimental Mr. Sikes	161	' And what good would that do ? '
54007	54058	54059	54060	The girl	5742	' Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope , you might as well be walking fifty mile off , or not walking at all , for all the good it would do me . Come on , and do n't stand preaching there . '
54242	54246	54248	54248	Sikes	161	' All right , '
54360	54364	54366	54366	Sikes	161	' Anybody here ? '
54368	54371	54366	54366	Sikes	161	' No , '
54384	54388	54366	54366	Sikes	161	' Is the old '
54392	54397	54366	54366	Sikes	161	' asked the robber . '
54400	54405	54366	54366	Sikes	161	' replied the voice , '
54429	54468	54418	54418	he	1564	' The style of this reply , as well as the voice which delivered it , seemed familiar to Oliver 's ears : but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness . '
54475	54479	54418	54418	he	1564	' said Sikes , '
54502	54503	54418	54418	he	1564	' '
54516	54645	54510	54510	I	0	' replied the voice . The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard ; and , in another minute , the form of Mr. John Dawkins , otherwise the Artful Dodger , appeared . He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick . The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin ; but , turning away , beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs . They crossed an empty kitchen ; and , opening the door of a low earthy - smelling room , which seemed to have been built in a small back - yard , were received with a shout of laughter . '
54654	54668	54670	54670	he	1565	' cried Master Charles Bates , from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded : '
54712	54727	54709	54709	I	0	' bear it . Hold me , somebody , while I laugh it out . '
54839	54847	54849	54849	Charley	179	' Look at his togs , Fagin ! '
54868	54905	54849	54849	Charley	179	' Look at his togs ! Superfine cloth , and the heavy swell cut ! Oh , my eye , what a game ! And his books , too ! Nothing but a gentleman , Fagin ! '
54906	54918	54920	54921	the Jew	1006	' Delighted to see you looking so well , my dear , '
54928	54973	54920	54921	the Jew	1006	' The Artful shall give you another suit , my dear , for fear you should spoil that Sunday one . Why did n't you write , my dear , and say you were coming ? We 'd have got something warm for supper . '
55024	55031	55033	55033	Sikes	161	' Hallo , what 's that ? '
55044	55051	55033	55033	Sikes	161	' That 's mine , Fagin . '
55052	55060	55062	55063	the Jew	1006	' No , no , my dear , '
55065	55078	55062	55063	the Jew	1006	' Mine , Bill , mine . You shall have the books . '
55079	55086	55088	55089	Bill Sikes	161	' If that ai n't mine ! '
55100	55116	55088	55089	Bill Sikes	161	' mine and Nancy 's that is ; I 'll take the boy back again . '
55147	55156	55158	55158	Sikes	161	' Come ! Hand over , will you ? '
55160	55176	55178	55179	the Jew	1006	' This is hardly fair , Bill ; hardly fair , is it , Nancy ? '
55181	55188	55190	55190	Sikes	161	' Fair , or not fair , '
55192	55249	55190	55190	Sikes	161	' hand over , I tell you ! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter , and kidnapping , every young boy as gets grabbed through you ? Give it here , you avaricious old skeleton , give it here ! '
55291	55301	55303	55303	Sikes	161	' That 's for our share of the trouble , '
55305	55321	55303	55303	Sikes	161	' and not half enough , neither . You may keep the books , if you 're
55332	55334	55327	55327	you	1006	'em . '
55335	55337	55255	55256	Mr. Sikes	161	' They 're
55341	55364	55255	55256	Mr. Sikes	161	' said Charley Bates : who , with sundry grimaces , had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question ; '
55374	55413	55372	55372	Oliver	123	' At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors , Master Bates , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first . '
55421	55429	55417	55419	the old gentleman	4702	' said Oliver , wringing his hands ; '
55530	55567	55568	55569	The boy	437	' With these words , which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief , Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew 's feet ; and beat his hands together , in perfect desperation . '
55573	55591	55568	55569	The boy	437	' remarked Fagin , looking covertly round , and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot . '
55593	55599	55602	55602	they	1586	're right , Oliver , you 're
55608	55614	55616	55617	the Jew	1006	'em . Ha ! ha ! '
55623	55638	55616	55617	the Jew	1006	' it could n't have happened better , if we had chosen our time ! '
55639	55646	55648	55648	Sikes	161	' Of course it could n't , '
55650	55677	55648	55648	Sikes	161	' I know'd that , directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell , with the books under his arm . It 's all right enough . They 're
55724	55790	55719	55719	He	1589	' Oliver had looked from one to the other , while these words were being spoken , as if he were bewildered , and could scarecely understand what passed ; but when Bill Sikes concluded , he jumped suddenly to his feet , and tore wildly from the room : uttering shrieks for help , which made the bare old house echo to the roof . '
55798	55823	55829	55829	he	1589	' cried Nancy , springing before the door , and closing it , as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit . '
55837	55838	55829	55829	he	1589	' '
55843	55857	55829	55829	he	1589	' cried Sikes , struggling to disengage himself from the girl 's grasp . '
55873	55874	55864	55864	I	0	' '
55891	55902	55884	55884	I	0	' screamed the girl , struggling violently with the man , '
55920	55921	55924	55924	he	1589	' '
55926	55934	55924	55924	he	1589	' said Sikes , setting his teeth . '
55948	55979	55942	55942	you	161	' The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room , just as the Jew and the two boys returned , dragging Oliver among them . '
55986	55993	55942	55942	you	161	' said Fagin , looking round . '
56003	56009	56000	56000	I	0	' replied Sikes , savagely . '
56016	56027	56012	56012	she	5742	' said Nancy , pale and breathless from the scuffle ; '
56041	56042	56030	56030	she	5742	' '
56050	56060	56048	56048	you	161	' said the Jew , with a threatening look . '
56071	56079	56069	56069	neither	1593	' replied Nancy , speaking very loud . '
56089	56148	56084	56084	you	174	' Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged , to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her , at present . With the view of diverting the attention of the company , he turned to Oliver . '
56162	56183	56160	56160	you	161	' said the Jew , taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace ; '
56186	56204	56216	56216	you	161	' Oliver made no reply . But he watched the Jew 's motions , and breathed quickly . '
56218	56230	56216	56216	you	161	' sneered the Jew , catching the boy by the arm . '
56242	56301	56216	56216	you	161	' The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver 's shoulders with the club ; and was raising it for a second , when the girl , rushing forward , wrested it from his hand . She flung it into the fire , with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room . '
56314	56319	56312	56312	Fagin	174	' cried the girl . '
56364	56418	56343	56343	I	0	' The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat ; and with her lips compressed , and her hands clenched , looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber : her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself . '
56423	56453	56454	56454	you	127	' said the Jew , in a soothing tone ; after a pause , during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner ; '
56458	56479	56457	56457	you	127	're more clever than ever to - night . Ha ! ha ! my dear , you are acting beautifully . '
56480	56484	56486	56487	the girl	5742	' Am I ! '
56489	56526	56486	56487	the girl	5742	' Take care I do n't overdo it . You will be the worse for it , Fagin , if I do ; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me . '
56699	56707	56709	56709	Sikes	161	' What do you mean by this ? '
56759	56783	56861	56862	The girl	5742	' what do you mean by it ? Burn my body ! Do you know who you are , and what you are ? '
56784	56795	56797	56798	the girl	5742	' Oh , yes , I know all about it , '
56819	56827	56829	56829	Sikes	161	' Well , then , keep quiet , '
56846	56860	56836	56836	he	161	' or I 'll quiet you for a good long time to come . '
56895	56897	56898	56900	a nice one	1606	' You 're
56902	56915	56898	56900	a nice one	1606	' added Sikes , as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air , '
56945	56946	56935	56935	you	161	' '
56955	56961	56935	56935	you	161	' cried the girl passionately ; '
57032	57033	57038	57038	Sikes	161	' '
57040	57067	57038	57038	Sikes	161	' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone , and motioning towards the boys , who were eagerly attentive to all that passed ; '
57079	57080	57077	57077	Bill	161	' '
57084	57096	57077	57077	Bill	161	' cried the girl , whose passion was frightful to see . '
57107	57127	57130	57130	Oliver	123	'em from me . I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this ! '
57132	57167	57130	57130	Oliver	123	' I have been in the same trade , and in the same service , for twelve years since . Do n't you know it ? Speak out ! Do n't you know it ? '
57168	57173	57175	57176	the Jew	1006	' Well , well , '
57184	57196	57175	57176	the Jew	1006	' and , if you have , it 's your living ! '
57197	57203	57205	57206	the girl	5742	' Aye , it is ! '
57223	57243	57175	57176	the Jew	1006	' It is my living ; and the cold , wet , dirty streets are my home ; and you 're
57273	57274	57275	57275	I	0	' '
57282	57292	57275	57275	I	0	' interposed the Jew , goaded by these reproaches ; '
57305	57371	57372	57372	She	1622	' The girl said nothing more ; but , tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion , made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him , had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment ; upon which , she made a few ineffectual struggles , and fainted . '
57378	57389	57372	57372	She	1622	' said Sikes , laying her down in a corner . '
57406	57459	57399	57399	she	1622	' The Jew wiped his forehead : and smiled , as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over ; but neither he , nor Sikes , nor the dog , nor the boys , seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business . '
57471	57480	57482	57482	they	5143	' said the Jew , replacing his club ; '
57483	57498	57500	57500	Charley	179	're clever , and we ca n't get on , in our line , without 'em
57507	57508	57500	57500	Charley	179	' '
57526	57531	57524	57524	he	123	' inquired Charley Bates . '
57535	57651	57524	57524	he	123	' replied the Jew , reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question . Master Bates , apparently much delighted with his commission , took the cleft stick : and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen , where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before ; and here , with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter , he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow 's ; and the accidental display of which , to Fagin , by the Jew who purchased them , had been the very first clue received , of his whereabout . '

57786	58425	58427	58428	that beadle	1628	'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS , BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION It is the custom on the stage , in all good murderous melodramas , to present the tragic and the comic scenes , in as regular alternation , as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon . The hero sinks upon his straw bed , weighed down by fetters and misfortunes ; in the next scene , his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song . We behold , with throbbing bosoms , the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron : her virtue and her life alike in danger , drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other ; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch , a whistle is heard , and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle ; where a grey - headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals , who are free of all sorts of places , from church vaults to palaces , and roam about in company , carolling perpetually . Such changes appear absurd ; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight . The transitions in real life from well - spread boards to death - beds , and from mourning - weeds to holiday garments , are not a whit less startling ; only , there , we are busy actors , instead of passive lookers - on , which makes a vast difference . The actors in the mimic life of the theatre , are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling , which , presented before the eyes of mere spectators , are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous . As sudden shiftings of the scene , and rapid changes of time and place , are not only sanctioned in books by long usage , but are by many considered as the great art of authorship : an author 's skill in his craft being , by such critics , chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter : this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary . If so , let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born ; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey , or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition . Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse - gate , and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps , up the High Street . He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood ; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun ; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power . Mr. Bumble always carried his head high ; but this morning it was higher than usual . There was an abstraction in his eye , an elevation in his air , which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle 's mind , too great for utterance . Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him , deferentially , as he passed along . He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand , and relaxed not in his dignified pace , until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care . '
58430	58447	58427	58428	that beadle	1628	' said Mrs. Mann , hearing the well - known shaking at the garden - gate . '
58494	58538	58490	58490	sir	4564	' The first sentence was addressed to Susan ; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble : as the good lady unlocked the garden - gate : and showed him , with great attention and respect , into the house . '
58542	58575	58539	58540	Mrs. Mann	139	' said Mr. Bumble ; not sitting upon , or dropping himself into a seat , as any common jackanapes would : but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair ; '
58584	58585	58579	58579	ma'am	4974	' '
58596	58605	58594	58594	sir	4564	' replied Mrs. Mann , with many smiles ; '
58615	58616	58613	58613	sir	4564	' '
58624	58629	58621	58622	Mrs. Mann	139	' replied the beadle . '
58643	58644	58640	58641	Mrs. Mann	139	' '
58656	58681	58653	58654	Mr. Bumble	130	' rejoined the lady . And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety , if they had heard it . '
58688	58700	58686	58686	ma'am	4974	' continued Mr. Bumble , striking the table with his cane , '
58727	58752	58719	58719	I	0	' Mrs. Mann , not very well knowing what the beadle meant , raised her hands with a look of sympathy , and sighed . '
58763	58804	58805	58806	Mrs. Mann	139	' said the beadle . Finding she had done right , Mrs. Mann sighed again : evidently to the satisfaction of the public character : who , repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat , said , '
58814	58815	58805	58806	Mrs. Mann	139	' '
58821	58829	58818	58819	Mr. Bumble	130	' cried Mrs. Mann , starting back . '
58835	58841	58833	58833	ma'am	4974	' resumed the inflexible beadle , '
58896	58905	58874	58875	Mrs. Mann	139	' added Mr. Bumble , drawing himself up , '

58940	58947	58929	58929	you	0	' said Mrs. Mann , coaxingly . '
58959	58964	58955	58955	themselves	1639	' replied Mr. Bumble ; '
58990	59028	58986	58986	themselves	1639	' There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words , that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them . At length she said , '
59030	59050	59059	59060	Mrs. Mann	139	're going by coach , sir ? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts . '
59051	59056	58986	58986	themselves	1639	' That 's when they 're
59062	59067	59059	59060	Mrs. Mann	139	' said the beadle . '

59091	59096	59059	59060	Mrs. Mann	139	' said Mrs. Mann . '

59205	59213	59215	59216	the beadle	389	' We are forgetting business , ma'am , '
59218	59228	59215	59216	the beadle	389	' here is your porochial stipend for the month . '
59256	59265	59267	59270	the farmer of infants	1647	' It 's very much blotted , sir , '
59272	59300	59267	59270	the farmer of infants	1647	' but it 's formal enough , I dare say . Thank you , Mr. Bumble , sir , I am very much obliged to you , I 'm
59303	59325	59267	59270	the farmer of infants	1647	' Mr. Bumble nodded , blandly , in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann 's curtsey ; and inquired how the children were . '
59332	59339	59340	59340	they	1648	' said Mrs. Mann with emotion , '
59341	59366	59267	59270	the farmer of infants	1647	're as well as can be , the dears ! Of course , except the two that died last week . And little Dick . '
59367	59375	59377	59378	Mr. Bumble	130	' Is n't that boy no better ? '
59386	59403	59405	59406	Mr. Bumble	130	' He 's a ill - conditioned , wicious , bad - disposed porochial child that , '
59409	59414	59405	59406	Mr. Bumble	130	' Where is he ? '
59415	59428	59430	59431	Mrs. Mann	139	' I 'll bring him to you in one minute , sir , '
59433	59439	59430	59431	Mrs. Mann	139	' Here , you Dick ! '
59565	59578	59580	59581	Mrs. Mann	139	' Ca n't you look at the gentleman , you obstinate boy ? '
59597	59608	59610	59611	Mr. Bumble	130	' What 's the matter with you , porochial Dick ? '
59619	59624	59626	59627	the child	321	' Nothing , sir , '
59630	59636	59638	59639	Mrs. Mann	139	' I should think not , '
59654	59661	59638	59639	Mrs. Mann	139	' You want for nothing , I 'm

59670	59675	59666	59666	I	0	' faltered the child . '
59680	59685	59666	59666	I	0	' interposed Mr. Mann , '
59689	59708	59719	59720	the beadle	389	're going to say that you DO want for something , now ? Why , you little wretch - '
59709	59717	59723	59723	his	389	' Stop , Mrs. Mann , stop ! '
59731	59739	59723	59723	his	389	' Like what , sir , eh ? '
59740	59745	59747	59748	the child	321	' I should like , '
59750	59793	59747	59748	the child	321	' if somebody that can write , would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper , and fold it up and seal it , and keep it for me , after I am laid in the ground . '
59794	59803	59805	59806	Mr. Bumble	130	' Why , what does the boy mean ? '
59832	59840	59747	59748	the child	321	' What do you mean , sir ? '
59841	59846	59848	59849	the child	321	' I should like , '
59851	59900	59902	59903	the child	321	' to leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist ; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him . And I should like to tell him , '
59916	59979	59902	59903	the child	321	' that I was glad to die when I was very young ; for , perhaps , if I had lived to be a man , and had grown old , my little sister who is in Heaven , might forget me , or be unlike me ; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together . '
60005	60007	60013	60014	Mrs. Mann	139	' They 're

60036	60052	60035	60035	sir	4564	' said Mrs Mann , holding up her hands , and looking malignantly at Dick . '
60062	60063	60035	60035	sir	4564	' '
60070	60076	60085	60086	Mrs. Mann	139	' said Mr. Bumble imperiously . '
60088	60104	60106	60107	Mrs. Mann	139	' I hope the gentleman will understand that it is n't my fault , sir ? '
60112	60132	60134	60135	Mr. Bumble	130	' They shall understand that , ma'am ; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case , '
60137	60153	60134	60135	Mr. Bumble	130	' There ; take him away , I ca n't bear the sight on him . '

60513	60596	60502	60503	the advertiser	1677	' And then followed a full description of Oliver 's dress , person , appearance , and disappearance : with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length . Mr. Bumble opened his eyes ; read the advertisement , slowly and carefully , three several times ; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville : having actually , in his excitement , left the glass of hot gin - and - water , untasted . '
60603	60630	60598	60599	Mr. Brownlow	194	' inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door . To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon , but rather evasive reply of '
60642	60680	60638	60638	you	194	' Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver 's name , in explanation of his errand , than Mrs. Bedwin , who had been listening at the parlour door , hastened into the passage in a breathless state . '
60687	60693	60694	60694	I	0	' said the old lady : '
60726	60822	60720	60720	I	0	' Having heard this , the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again ; and seating herself on a sofa , burst into tears . The girl , who was not quite so susceptible , had run upstairs meanwhile ; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately : which he did . He was shown into the little back study , where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig , with decanters and glasses before them . The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation : '
60837	60838	60831	60831	I	0	' '
60846	60851	60831	60831	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow . '
60859	60904	60857	60857	you	0	' Mr. Bumble sat himself down ; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig 's manner . Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp , so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle 's countenance ; and said , with a little impatience , '
60919	60920	60923	60923	sir	4564	' '
60925	60930	60923	60923	sir	4564	' said Mr. Bumble . '
60941	60946	60938	60938	you	4564	' inquired Mr. Grimwig . '
60955	60961	60953	60953	gentlemen	1328	' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly . '
60965	60974	60953	60953	gentlemen	1328	' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend , '
60985	61002	61004	61004	you	4564	' Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend , and resumed : '
61013	61014	61004	61004	you	4564	' '
61020	61025	61018	61018	nobody	354	' replied Mr. Bumble . '
61035	61041	61030	61030	you	4564	' inquired the old gentleman . '

61078	61112	61113	61113	You	4564	' said Mr. Grimwig , caustically ; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble 's features . Mr. Bumble , catching at the inquiry very quickly , shook his head with portentous solemnity . '
61116	61187	61191	61191	his	1687	' said Mr. Grimwig , looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow . Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble 's pursed - up countenance ; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver , in as few words as possible . Mr. Bumble put down his hat ; unbuttoned his coat ; folded his arms ; inclined his head in a retrospective manner ; and , after a few moments '
61340	61349	61351	61353	the old gentleman	4702	' I fear it is all too true , '
61362	61391	61351	61353	the old gentleman	4702	' This is not much for your intelligence ; but I would gladly have given you treble the money , if it had been favourable to the boy . '

61511	61521	61503	61504	Mr. Brownlow	194	' that boy , Oliver , is an imposter . '

61542	61549	61551	61553	the old gentleman	4702	' I tell you he is , '
61555	61593	61551	61553	the old gentleman	4702	' What do you mean by ca n't be ? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth ; and he has been a thorough - paced little villain , all his life . '
61594	61603	61605	61607	the old lady	5061	' I never will believe it , sir , '
61611	61614	61605	61607	the old lady	5061	' Never ! '
61615	61633	61635	61636	Mr. Grimwig	1705	' You old women never believe anything but quack - doctors , and lying story - books , '
61638	61683	61635	61636	Mr. Grimwig	1705	' I knew it all along . Why did n't you take my advise in the beginning ; you would if he had n't had a fever , I suppose , eh ? He was interesting , was n't he ? Interesting ! Bah ! '
61694	61707	61709	61710	Mrs. Bedwin	187	' He was a dear , grateful , gentle child , sir , '
61714	61751	61709	61710	Mrs. Bedwin	187	' I know what children are , sir ; and have done these forty years ; and people who ca n't say the same , should n't say anything about them . That 's my opinion ! '

61820	61864	61807	61809	the old gentleman	4702	' Never let me hear the boy 's name again . I rang to tell you that . Never . Never , on any pretence , mind ! You may leave the room , Mrs. Bedwin . Remember ! I am in earnest . '

63460	63498	63499	63499	I	0	' Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock , after delivering this sentiment , and looked at Master Bates , as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary . '
63502	63507	63499	63499	I	0	' repeated the Dodger . '
63548	63549	63539	63539	he	1768	' '

63695	63756	63687	63693	an out - and - out Christian	1773	' said Charley . This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal 's abilities , but it was an appropriate remark in another sense , if Master Bates had only known it ; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen , claiming to be out - and - out Christians , between whom , and Mr. Sikes '
63768	63773	63775	63776	the Dodger	5121	' Well , well , '

63837	63842	63775	63776	the Dodger	5121	' And make your fortun '
63847	63856	63775	63776	the Dodger	5121	' added the Dodger , with a grin . '
63903	63908	63909	63909	I	0	' said Charley Bates . '
63915	63921	63909	63909	I	0	' rejoined Oliver , timidly ; '

63946	63982	63941	63941	Fagin	174	' rejoined Charley . Oliver knew this too well ; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly , he only sighed , and went on with his boot - cleaning . '
63985	63990	63941	63941	Fagin	174	' exclaimed the Dodger . '
63998	64019	64067	64068	the Dodger	5121	' Do n't you take any pride out of yourself ? Would you go and be dependent on your friends ? '
64020	64026	64028	64029	Master Bates	179	' Oh , blow that ! '
64048	64057	64028	64029	Master Bates	179	' that 's too mean ; that is . '
64058	64065	64067	64068	the Dodger	5121	' I could n't do it , '
64077	64086	64088	64088	Oliver	123	' You can leave your friends , though , '
64094	64105	64088	64088	Oliver	123	' and let them be punished for what you did . '
64106	64109	64111	64112	the Dodger	5121	' That , '
64121	64131	64118	64118	his	5121	' That was all out of consideration for Fagin , 'cause
64166	64230	64164	64164	Charley	179	' Master Bates nodded assent , and would have spoken , but the recollection of Oliver 's flight came so suddenly upon him , that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh , and went up into his head , and down into his throat : and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping , about five minutes long . '
64234	64248	64164	64164	Charley	179	' said the Dodger , drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence . '
64293	64294	64289	64289	you	179	' '
64305	64310	64303	64303	Oliver	123	' inquired Charley Bates . '
64322	64323	64320	64320	he	123	' '
64332	64336	64324	64324	I	0	' replied Oliver . '
64345	64409	64342	64343	old feller	1785	' said Charly . As he said it , Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief ; and , holding it erect in the air , dropped his head on his shoulder , and jerked a curious sound through his teeth ; thereby indicating , by a lively pantomimic representation , that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing . '
64416	64420	64342	64343	old feller	1785	' said Charley . '
64437	64454	64428	64428	I	0	' ere boy ; he 'll be the death of me , I know he will . '
64473	64481	64483	64484	the Dodger	5121	' You 've been brought up bad , '
64498	64545	64483	64484	the Dodger	5121	' Fagin will make something of you , though , or you 'll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable . You 'd better begin at once ; for you 'll come to the trade long before you think of it ; and you 're
64552	64632	64550	64550	Oliver	123	' Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own : which , being exhausted , he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led , interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do , would be to secure Fagin 's favour without more delay , by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it . '
64643	64658	64638	64638	your	123	' said the Dodger , as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above , '
64668	64669	64660	64660	you	123	' '
64680	64685	64686	64686	he	123	' interposed Master Bates ; '
64694	64695	64686	64686	he	123	' '
64707	64723	64724	64726	some other cove	1787	' said the Dodger , reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver 's capacity , '
64735	64781	64691	64691	you	123	'em will be all the worse , and you 'll be all the worse , too , and nobody half a ha'p'orth the better , except the chaps wot gets them - and you 've just as good a right to them as they have . '
64782	64791	64793	64794	the Jew	1006	' To be sure , to be sure ! '
64803	64839	64793	64794	the Jew	1006	' It all lies in a nutshell my dear ; in a nutshell , take the Dodger 's word for it . Ha ! ha ! ha ! He understands the catechism of his trade . '
65038	65040	65028	65028	he	208	' time '
65171	65188	65246	65247	Tom Chitling	207	' wished he might be busted if he warn't as dry as a lime - basket . '
65189	65202	65204	65205	the Jew	1006	' Where do you think the gentleman has come from , Oliver ? '
65224	65235	65237	65237	Oliver	123	' I - I - do n't know , sir , '
65239	65244	65246	65247	Tom Chitling	207	' Who 's that ? '
65256	65266	65268	65269	the Jew	1006	' A young friend of mine , my dear , '
65271	65279	65281	65283	the young man	1803	' He 's in luck , then , '
65292	65301	65281	65283	the young man	1803	' Never mind where I came from , young '
65320	66059	66061	66061	me	0	' At this sally , the boys laughed . After some more jokes on the same subject , they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin ; and withdrew . After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin , they drew their chairs towards the fire ; and the Jew , telling Oliver to come and sit by him , led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers . These were , the great advantages of the trade , the proficiency of the Dodger , the amiability of Charley Bates , and the liberality of the Jew himself . At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted ; and Mr. Chitling did the same : for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two . Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew ; and left the party to their repose . From this day , Oliver was seldom left alone ; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the Jew every day : whether for their own improvement or Oliver 's , Mr. Fagin best knew . At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days : mixed up with so much that was droll and curious , that Oliver could not help laughing heartily , and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings . In short , the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils . Having prepared his mind , by solitude and gloom , to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place , he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it , and change its hue for ever . CHAPTER XIX IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON It was a chill , damp , windy night , when the Jew : buttoning his great - coat tight round his shrivelled body , and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face : emerged from his den . He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him ; and having listened while the boys made all secure , and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible , slunk down the street as quickly as he could . The house to which Oliver had been conveyed , was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel . The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street ; and , glancing suspiciously round , crossed the road , and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields . The mud lay thick upon the stones , and a black mist hung over the streets ; the rain fell sluggishly down , and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch . It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad . As he glided stealthily along , creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways , the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile , engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved : crawling forth , by night , in search of some rich offal for a meal . He kept on his course , through many winding and narrow ways , until he reached Bethnal Green ; then , turning suddenly off to the left , he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely - populated quarter . The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered , either by the darkness of the night , or the intricacies of the way . He hurried through several alleys and streets , and at length turned into one , lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end . At the door of a house in this street , he knocked ; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it , he walked upstairs . A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room - door ; and a man 's voice demanded who was there . '
66071	66078	66066	66066	me	0	' said the Jew looking in . '
66085	66089	66066	66066	me	0	' said Sikes . '
66113	66181	66101	66102	the devil	1806	' Apparently , the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin 's outer garment ; for as the Jew unbuttoned it , and threw it over the back of a chair , he retired to the corner from which he had risen : wagging his tail as he went , to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be . '
66184	66188	66101	66102	the devil	1806	' said Sikes . '
66194	66200	66101	66102	the devil	1806	' replied the Jew . - '
66205	66302	66203	66203	Nancy	127	' The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception ; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met , since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver . All doubts upon the subject , if he had any , were speedily removed by the young lady 's behaviour . She took her feet off the fender , pushed back her chair , and bade Fagin draw up his , without saying more about it : for it was a cold night , and no mistake . '
66310	66325	66307	66307	Nancy	127	' said the Jew , as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire . '
66334	66344	66307	66307	Nancy	127	' added the old man , touching his side . '
66360	66365	66372	66372	Nancy	127	' said Mr. Sikes . '
66411	66461	66469	66469	Bill	161	' Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard , in which there were many : which , to judge from the diversity of their appearance , were filled with several kinds of liquids . Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy , bade the Jew drink it off . '
66471	66488	66469	66469	Bill	161	' replied the Jew , putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it . '
66492	66505	66507	66507	Sikes	161	're afraid of our getting the better of you , are you ? '
66516	66519	66510	66510	his	161	' Ugh ! '
66652	66656	66752	66752	you	1006	' life - preserver '
66665	66668	66670	66670	Sikes	161	' There , '
66676	66679	66673	66673	his	161	' Now I 'm

66687	66692	66670	66670	Sikes	161	' inquired the Jew . '
66696	66700	66670	66670	Sikes	161	' replied Sikes ; '
66710	66711	66704	66704	you	1006	' '
66720	66738	66718	66718	Bill	161	' said the Jew , drawing his chair forward , and speaking in a very low voice . '
66745	66749	66777	66777	he	161	' inquired Sikes . '
66761	66766	66755	66755	I	0	' said the Jew . '
66779	66780	66777	66777	he	161	' '
66787	66792	66783	66783	he	161	' sneered Mr. Sikes . '
66849	66850	66853	66853	Bill	161	' '
66857	66874	66853	66853	Bill	161	' said the Jew , who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation ; '
66888	66889	66883	66883	Somebody	5443	' '
66891	66894	66896	66896	Sikes	161	'em hear ! '
66898	66904	66896	66896	Sikes	161	' I do n't care . '
66929	66934	66936	66937	the Jew	1006	' There , there , '
66941	66989	66991	66992	the Jew	1006	' It was only my caution , nothing more . Now , my dear , about that crib at Chertsey ; when is it to be done , Bill , eh ? When is it to be done ? Such plate , my dear , such plate ! '
67008	67013	67015	67015	Sikes	161	' Not at all , '
67018	67026	67028	67029	the Jew	1006	' Not to be done at all ! '
67037	67044	67046	67046	Sikes	161	' No , not at all , '
67048	67065	67046	67046	Sikes	161	' At least it ca n't be a put - up job , as we expected . '
67066	67076	67078	67079	the Jew	1006	' Then it has n't been properly gone about , '
67086	67092	67078	67079	the Jew	1006	' Do n't tell me ! '
67093	67100	67102	67102	Sikes	161	' But I will tell you , '
67104	67143	67102	67102	Sikes	161	' Who are you that 's not to be told ? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight , and he ca n't get one of the servants in line . '
67144	67154	67156	67157	the Jew	1006	' Do you mean to tell me , Bill , '
67166	67181	67156	67157	the Jew	1006	' that neither of the two men in the house can be got over ? '
67182	67193	67195	67195	Sikes	161	' Yes , I do mean to tell you so , '
67197	67203	67102	67102	Sikes	161	' The old lady has had 'em
67214	67226	67156	67157	the Jew	1006	'em five hundred pound , they would n't be in it . '
67227	67238	67240	67241	the Jew	1006	' But do you mean to say , my dear , '
67243	67253	67240	67241	the Jew	1006	' that the women ca n't be got over ? '
67254	67261	67263	67263	Sikes	161	' Not a bit of it , '
67265	67272	67274	67275	the Jew	1006	' Not by flash Toby Crackit ? '
67278	67286	67274	67275	the Jew	1006	' Think what women are , Bill , '
67287	67297	67299	67299	Sikes	161	' No ; not even by flash Toby Crackit , '
67301	67334	67299	67299	Sikes	161	' He says he 's worn sham whiskers , and a canary waistcoat , the whole blessed time he 's been loitering down there , and it 's all of no use . '
67335	67351	67353	67354	the Jew	1006	' He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers , my dear , '
67356	67361	67353	67354	the Jew	1006	' So he did , '
67365	67378	67363	67363	Sikes	161	' and they warn't of no more use than the other plant . '
67427	67431	67433	67435	the old man	5173	' And yet , '
67444	67467	67438	67438	his	5173	' it 's a sad thing , my dear , to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it . '
67468	67473	67475	67476	Mr. Sikes	161	' So it is , '
67478	67482	67475	67476	Mr. Sikes	161	' Worse luck ! '
67548	67551	67553	67553	Sikes	161	' Fagin , '
67562	67579	67553	67553	Sikes	161	' is it worth fifty shiners extra , if it 's safely done from the outside ? '
67580	67583	67585	67586	the Jew	1006	' Yes , '
67593	67599	67601	67601	Sikes	161	' Is it a bargain ? '
67603	67611	67616	67616	his	1006	' Yes , my dear , yes , '
67637	67640	67642	67642	Sikes	161	' Then , '
67655	67713	67642	67642	Sikes	161	' let it come off as soon as you like . Toby and me were over the garden - wall the night afore last , sounding the panels of the door and shutters . The crib 's barred up at night like a jail ; but there 's one part we can crack , safe and softly . '
67714	67721	67723	67724	the Jew	1006	' Which is that , Bill ? '
67727	67730	67732	67732	Sikes	161	' Why , '
67734	67741	67732	67732	Sikes	161	' as you cross the lawn - '
67742	67745	67747	67748	the Jew	1006	' Yes ? '
67764	67767	67769	67769	Sikes	161	' Umph ! '
67798	67833	67780	67780	her	5742	' Never mind which part it is . You ca n't do it without me , I know ; but it 's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you . '
67834	67845	67847	67848	the Jew	1006	' As you like , my dear , as you like '
67850	67863	67847	67848	the Jew	1006	' Is there no help wanted , but yours and Toby 's ? '
67864	67867	67869	67869	Sikes	161	' None , '
67871	67895	67869	67869	Sikes	161	' Cept a centre - bit and a boy . The first we 've both got ; the second you must find us . '
67896	67900	67902	67903	the Jew	1006	' A boy ! '
67905	67916	67902	67903	the Jew	1006	' Oh ! then it 's a panel , eh ? '
67917	67924	67926	67926	Sikes	161	' Never mind wot it is ! '
67928	67940	67926	67926	Sikes	161	' I want a boy , and he musn't be a big '
67945	67952	67902	67903	the Jew	1006	' said Mr. Sikes , reflectively , '
68025	68036	68041	68041	his	161	' prentice of him . And so they go on , '
68051	68094	68041	68041	his	161	' so they go on ; and , if they 'd got money enough which it 's a Providence they have n't , we should n't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade , in a year or two . '
68095	68101	68103	68112	the Jew , who had been considering during this speech	1852	' No more we should , '
68122	68125	68103	68112	the Jew , who had been considering during this speech	1852	' Bill ! '
68126	68130	68132	68132	Sikes	161	' What now ? '
68199	68207	68209	68209	Nancy	127	' You do n't want any beer , '
68222	68229	68231	68231	Sikes	161	' I tell you I do ! '
68233	68236	68238	68239	the girl	5742	' Nonsense , '
68242	68265	68238	68239	the girl	5742	' Go on , Fagin . I know what he 's going to say , Bill ; he need n't mind me . '
68282	68298	68299	68299	he	161	' Why , you do n't mind the old girl , do you , Fagin ? '
68304	68333	68299	68299	he	161	' You 've known her long enough to trust her , or the Devil 's in it . She ai n't one to blab . Are you Nancy ? '
68334	68340	68342	68344	the young lady	5568	' I should think not ! '
68361	68372	68356	68356	her	5568	' No , no , my dear , I know you 're
68375	68380	68356	68356	her	5568	' said the Jew ; '
68383	68391	68356	68356	her	5568	' and again the old man paused . '
68395	68399	68400	68400	I	0	' inquired Sikes . '
68427	68467	68421	68421	she	5568	' replied the Jew . At this confession , Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh ; and , swallowing a glass of brandy , shook her head with an air of defiance , and burst into sundry exclamations of '
68475	68476	68421	68421	she	5568	' '
68481	68521	68421	68421	she	5568	' and the like . These seemed to have the effect of re - assuring both gentlemen ; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air , and resumed his seat : as did Mr. Sikes likewise . '
68526	68533	68524	68524	Fagin	174	' said Nancy with a laugh . '
68542	68543	68535	68535	Bill	161	' '
68547	68562	68564	68565	the Jew	1006	're a clever one , my dear : the sharpest girl I ever saw ! '
68573	68593	68564	68565	the Jew	1006	' It WAS about Oliver I was going to speak , sure enough . Ha ! ha ! ha ! '
68594	68599	68601	68601	Sikes	161	' What about him ? '
68603	68614	68616	68617	the Jew	1006	' He 's the boy for you , my dear , '
68637	68640	68643	68643	Sikes	161	' He ! '
68645	68651	68653	68653	Nancy	127	' Have him , Bill ! '
68655	68710	68653	68653	Nancy	127	' I would , if I was in your place . He may n't be so much up , as any of the others ; but that 's not what you want , if he 's only to open a door for you . Depend upon it he 's a safe one , Bill . '
68711	68717	68719	68719	Fagin	174	' I know he is , '
68721	68754	68719	68719	Fagin	174	' He 's been in good training these last few weeks , and it 's time he began to work for his bread . Besides , the others are all too big . '
68755	68766	68768	68769	Mr. Sikes	161	' Well , he is just the size I want , '
68773	68786	68788	68789	the Jew	1006	' And will do everything you want , Bill , my dear , '
68791	68807	68788	68789	the Jew	1006	' he ca n't help himself . That is , if you frighten him enough . '
68808	68812	68814	68814	Sikes	161	' Frighten him ! '
68816	68875	68877	68878	the robber	1469	' It 'll be no sham frightening , mind you . If there 's anything queer about him when we once get into the work ; in for a penny , in for a pound . You wo n't see him alive again , Fagin . Think of that , before you send him . Mark my words ! '
68893	68901	68903	68904	the Jew	1006	' I 've thought of it all , '
68908	68999	68903	68904	the Jew	1006	' I 've - I 've had my eye upon him , my dears , close - close . Once let him feel that he is one of us ; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief ; and he 's ours ! Ours for his life . Oho ! It could n't have come about better ! The old man crossed his arms upon his breast ; and , drawing his head and shoulders into a heap , literally hugged himself for joy . '
69002	69006	69007	69007	Yours	1865	' said Sikes . '
69012	69013	69009	69009	you	1865	' '
69021	69031	69032	69032	Mine	0	' said the Jew , with a shrill chuckle . '
69040	69041	69038	69038	Bill	161	' '
69045	69056	69038	69038	Bill	161	' said Sikes , scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend , '
69093	69094	69096	69096	they	1868	' '
69097	69107	69109	69110	the Jew	1006	're of no use to me , my dear , '
69116	69125	69109	69110	the Jew	1006	' not worth the taking . Their looks convict 'em
69135	69162	69164	69165	the Jew	1006	'em all . With this boy , properly managed , my dears , I could do what I could n't with twenty of them . Besides , '
69173	69264	69164	69165	the Jew	1006	' he has us now if he could only give us leg - bail again ; and he must be in the same boat with us . Never mind how he came there ; it 's quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery ; that 's all I want . Now , how much better this is , than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way - which would be dangerous , and we should lose by it besides . '
69265	69273	69275	69275	Nancy	127	' When is it to be done ? '
69302	69309	69311	69312	the Jew	1006	' Ah , to be sure , '
69314	69324	69311	69312	the Jew	1006	' when is it to be done , Bill ? '
69325	69338	69340	69340	Sikes	161	' I planned with Toby , the night arter to - morrow , '
69346	69357	69340	69340	Sikes	161	' if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy . '
69358	69361	69363	69364	the Jew	1006	' Good , '
69366	69372	69363	69364	the Jew	1006	' there 's no moon . '
69373	69376	69378	69378	Sikes	161	' No , '
69380	69394	69396	69397	the Jew	1006	' It 's all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it ? '
69402	69406	69399	69399	Sikes	161	' And about - '
69407	69417	69419	69419	Sikes	161	' Oh , ah , it 's all planned , '
69424	69476	69419	69419	Sikes	161	' Never mind particulars . You 'd better bring the boy here to - morrow night . I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak . Then you hold your tongue , and keep the melting - pot ready , and that 's all you 'll have to do . '
69785	69792	69794	69795	the Jew	1006	' Good - night , Nancy , '
69803	69808	69794	69795	the Jew	1006	' Good - night . '
69876	69881	69883	69884	the Jew	1006	' Always the way ! '
69892	69944	69886	69886	himself	1006	' The worst of these women is , that a very little thing serves to call up some long - forgotten feeling ; and , the best of them is , that it never lasts . Ha ! ha ! The man against the child , for a bag of gold ! '
69981	69995	69997	69997	his	5121	' Is Oliver a - bed ? I want to speak to him , '
70006	70010	70012	70013	the Dodger	5121	' Hours ago , '
70020	70025	70012	70013	the Dodger	5121	' Here he is ! '
70121	70125	70127	70128	the Jew	1006	' Not now , '
70134	70143	70127	70128	the Jew	1006	' To - morrow . To - morrow . '
70267	70277	70279	70279	Oliver	123	' To - to - stop there , sir ? '
70283	70296	70298	70299	the Jew	1006	' No , no , my dear . Not to stop there , '
70301	70351	70371	70371	he	1900	' We should n't like to lose you . Do n't be afraid , Oliver , you shall come back to us again . Ha ! ha ! ha ! We wo n't be so cruel as to send you away , my dear . Oh no , no ! '
70398	70402	70404	70405	the Jew	1006	' I suppose , '
70413	70420	70408	70408	his	1006	' you want to know what you 're
70432	70462	70423	70423	Bill	161	' Oliver coloured , involuntarily , to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts ; but boldly said , Yes , he did want to know . '
70469	70477	70466	70466	you	123	' inquired Fagin , parrying the question . '
70486	70490	70479	70479	I	0	' replied Oliver . '
70493	70514	70479	70479	I	0	' said the Jew , turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy 's face . '
70523	70605	70517	70517	Bill	161	' The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver 's not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject ; but the truth is , that , although Oliver felt very anxious , he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin 's looks , and his own speculations , to make any further inquiries just then . He had no other opportunity : for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night : when he prepared to go abroad . '
70612	70623	70517	70517	Bill	161	' said the Jew , putting one upon the table . '
70645	70646	70517	70517	Bill	161	' '
70651	70742	70517	70517	Bill	161	' replied Oliver , softly . The Jew walked to the door : looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went . Suddenly stopping , he called him by his name . Oliver looked up ; the Jew , pointing to the candle , motioned him to light it . He did so ; and , as he placed the candlestick upon the table , saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him , with lowering and contracted brows , from the dark end of the room . '
70751	70768	70769	70769	He	1905	' said the old man , shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner . '
70802	71429	70796	70796	he	1905	' Placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room . Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard . The more he thought of the Jew 's admonition , the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning . He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes , which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin ; and after meditating for a long time , concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker , until another boy , better suited for his purpose could be engaged . He was too well accustomed to suffering , and had suffered too much where he was , to bewail the prospect of change very severely . He remained lost in thought for some minutes ; and then , with a heavy sigh , snuffed the candle , and , taking up the book which the Jew had left with him , began to read . He turned over the leaves . Carelessly at first ; but , lighting on a passage which attracted his attention , he soon became intent upon the volume . It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals ; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use . Here , he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold ; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside ; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells : which would not keep them down , deep as they were , but had yielded them up at last , after many years , and so maddened the murderers with the sight , that in their horror they had confessed their guilt , and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony . Here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted so they said and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of . The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid , that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore ; and the words upon them , to be sounded in his ears , as if they were whispered , in hollow murmurs , by the spirits of the dead . In a paroxysm of fear , the boy closed the book , and thrust it from him . Then , falling upon his knees , he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds ; and rather to will that he should die at once , than be reserved for crimes , so fearful and appalling . By degrees , he grew more calm , and besought , in a low and broken voice , that he might be rescued from his present dangers ; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred , it might come to him now , when , desolate and deserted , he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt . He had concluded his prayer , but still remained with his head buried in his hands , when a rustling noise aroused him . '
71434	71452	70796	70796	he	1905	' he cried , starting up , and catching sight of a figure standing by the door . '
71457	71458	71459	71459	Me	0	' '
71464	71488	71459	71459	Me	0	' replied a tremulous voice . Oliver raised the candle above his head : and looked towards the door . It was Nancy . '
71494	71504	71459	71459	Me	0	' said the girl , turning away her head . '
71510	71551	71459	71459	Me	0	' Oliver saw that she was very pale , and gently inquired if she were ill . The girl threw herself into a chair , with her back towards him : and wrung her hands ; but made no reply . '
71556	71563	71552	71552	God	167	' she cried after a while , '
71570	71571	71552	71552	God	167	' '
71576	71580	71552	71552	God	167	' asked Oliver . '
71597	71620	71621	71621	Nancy	127	' She rocked herself to and fro ; caught her throat ; and , uttering a gurgling sound , gasped for breath . '
71623	71627	71621	71621	Nancy	127	' cried Oliver , '
71632	71702	71621	71621	Nancy	127	' The girl beat her hands upon her knees , and her feet upon the ground ; and , suddenly stopping , drew her shawl close round her : and shivered with cold . Oliver stirred the fire . Drawing her chair close to it , she sat there , for a little time , without speaking ; but at length she raised her head , and looked round . '
71713	71726	71734	71734	I	0	' said she , affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress ; '
71747	71748	71739	71739	Nolly	123	' '
71756	71760	71750	71750	I	0	' asked Oliver . '
71769	71774	71767	71767	Bill	161	' replied the girl . '
71782	71783	71775	71775	You	0	' '
71787	71793	71775	71775	You	0	' asked Oliver , recoiling . '
71797	71820	71775	71775	You	0	' echoed the girl , raising her eyes , and averting them again , the moment they encountered the boy 's face . '
71827	71828	71775	71775	You	0	' '
71835	71845	71829	71829	I	0	' said Oliver : who had watched her closely . '
71852	71861	71848	71848	your	769	' rejoined the girl , affecting to laugh . '
71868	72010	71848	71848	your	769	' Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl 's better feelings , and , for an instant , thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state . But , then , the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o'clock ; and that many people were still in the streets : of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale . As the reflection occured to him , he stepped forward : and said , somewhat hastily , that he was ready . Neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion . She eyed him narrowly , while he spoke ; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts . '
72013	72033	72034	72034	You	1909	' said the girl , stooping over him , and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round . '
72076	72116	72117	72117	I	0	' Struck by the energy of her manner , Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise . She seemed to speak the truth ; her countenance was white and agitated ; and she trembled with very earnestness . '
72138	72144	72134	72134	I	0	' continued the girl aloud ; '
72220	72243	72214	72214	God	167	' She pointed , hastily , to some livid bruises on her neck and arms ; and continued , with great rapidity : '
72319	72578	72316	72316	Your	1909	' She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs . The door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out . A hackney - cabriolet was in waiting ; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver , the girl pulled him in with her , and drew the curtains close . The driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant . The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand , and continued to pour into his ear , the warnings and assurances she had already imparted . All was so quick and hurried , that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was , or how he came there , when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew 's steps had been directed on the previous evening . For one brief moment , Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street , and a cry for help hung upon his lips . But the girl 's voice was in his ear , beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her , that he had not the heart to utter it . While he hesitated , the opportunity was gone ; he was already in the house , and the door was shut . '
72582	72595	72596	72596	Bill	161	' said the girl , releasing her hold for the first time . '
72598	72599	72596	72596	Bill	161	' '
72602	72618	72596	72596	Bill	161	' replied Sikes : appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle . '
72631	72652	72681	72681	he	161	' This was a very strong expression of approbation , an uncommonly hearty welcome , from a person of Mr. Sikes '
72666	72676	72678	72678	Sikes	161	' Bull's - eye 's gone home with Tom , '
72686	72695	72681	72681	he	161	' He 'd have been in the way . '
72696	72701	72703	72703	Nancy	127	' That 's right , '
72705	72713	72715	72715	Sikes	161	' So you 've got the kid , '
72731	72738	72740	72740	Nancy	127	' Yes , here he is , '
72742	72748	72750	72750	Sikes	161	' Did he come quiet ? '
72752	72757	72759	72759	Nancy	127	' Like a lamb , '
72761	72763	72759	72759	Nancy	127	' I 'm
72769	72778	72759	72759	Nancy	127	' said Sikes , looking grimly at Oliver ; '
72799	72809	72798	72800	young ' un	6041	' un ; and let me read you a lectur '
72820	72866	72798	72800	young ' un	6041	' Thus addressing his new pupil , Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver 's cap and threw it into a corner ; and then , taking him by the shoulder , sat himself down by the table , and stood the boy in front of him . '
72878	72900	72872	72872	you	1913	' inquired Sikes , taking up a pocket - pistol which lay on the table . Oliver replied in the affirmative . '
72908	72912	72872	72872	you	1913	' continued Sikes . '
72918	72936	72872	72872	you	1913	' ere 's a bullet ; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin '
72938	72965	72872	72872	you	1913	' Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to ; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation . '
72971	72981	72984	72984	I	0	' said Mr. Sikes , when he had finished . '
72991	72995	72989	72989	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . '
72998	73032	72989	72989	sir	4564	' said the robber , grasping Oliver 's wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched ; at which moment the boy could not repress a start ; '
73040	73082	72989	72989	sir	4564	're out o'doors with me , except when I speak to you , that loading will be in your head without notice . So , if you do make up your mind to speak without leave , say your prayers first . '
73103	73160	73099	73100	Mr. Sikes	161	' As near as I know , there is n't anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you , if you was disposed of ; so I need n't take this devil - and - all of trouble to explain matters to you , if it warn't for your own good . D'ye hear me ? '
73161	73172	73174	73174	Nancy	127	' The short and the long of what you mean , '
73196	73202	73193	73193	her	127	' is , that if you 're
73261	73262	73294	73294	they	5143	' '
73267	73274	73275	73275	women	5143	' observed Mr. Sikes , approvingly ; '
73322	73377	74735	74737	young ' un	6041	' In pursuance of this request , Nancy quickly laid the cloth ; disappearing for a few minutes , she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep 's heads : which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes , founded upon the singular coincidence of '
73379	73715	74735	74737	young ' un	6041	' being a can name , common to them , and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession . Indeed , the worthy gentleman , stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service , was in great spirits and good humour ; in proof whereof , it may be here remarked , that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught , and did not utter , on a rough calculation , more than four - score oaths during the whole progress of the meal . Supper being ended - it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it - Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water , and threw himself on the bed ; ordering Nancy , with many imprecations in case of failure , to call him at five precisely . Oliver stretched himself in his clothes , by command of the same authority , on a mattress upon the floor ; and the girl , mending the fire , sat before it , in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time . For a long time Oliver lay awake , thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice ; but the girl sat brooding over the fire , without moving , save now and then to trim the light . Weary with watching and anxiety , he at length fell asleep . When he awoke , the table was covered with tea - things , and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great - coat , which hung over the back of a chair . Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast . It was not yet daylight ; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside . A sharp rain , too , was beating against the window - panes ; and the sky looked black and cloudy . '
73720	73729	74735	74737	young ' un	6041	' growled Sikes , as Oliver started up ; '
73753	74732	74735	74737	young ' un	6041	' Oliver was not long in making his toilet ; having taken some breakfast , he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes , by saying that he was quite ready . Nancy , scarcely looking at the boy , threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat ; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders . Thus attired , he gave his hand to the robber , who , merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side - pocket of his great - coat , clasped it firmly in his , and , exchanging a farewell with Nancy , led him away . Oliver turned , for an instant , when they reached the door , in the hope of meeting a look from the girl . But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire , and sat , perfectly motionless before it . CHAPTER XXI THE EXPEDITION It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street ; blowing and raining hard ; and the clouds looking dull and stormy . The night had been very wet : large pools of water had collected in the road : and the kennels were overflowing . There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky ; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene : the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded , without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house - tops , and dreary streets . There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town ; the windows of the houses were all closely shut ; and the streets through which they passed , were noiseless and empty . By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road , the day had fairly begun to break . Many of the lamps were already extinguished ; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards London ; now and then , a stage - coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by : the driver bestowing , as he passed , an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time . The public - houses , with gas - lights burning inside , were already open . By degrees , other shops began to be unclosed , and a few scattered people were met with . Then , came straggling groups of labourers going to their work ; then , men and women with fish - baskets on their heads ; donkey - carts laden with vegetables ; chaise - carts filled with live - stock or whole carcasses of meat ; milk - women with pails ; an unbroken concourse of people , trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town . As they approached the City , the noise and traffic gradually increased ; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield , it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle . It was as light as it was likely to be , till night came on again , and the busy morning of half the London population had begun . Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street , and crossing Finsbury square , Mr. Sikes struck , by way of Chiswell Street , into Barbican : thence into Long Lane , and so into Smithfield ; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement . It was market - morning . The ground was covered , nearly ankle - deep , with filth and mire ; a thick steam , perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle , and mingling with the fog , which seemed to rest upon the chimney - tops , hung heavily above . All the pens in the centre of the large area , and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space , were filled with sheep ; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen , three or four deep . Countrymen , butchers , drovers , hawkers , boys , thieves , idlers , and vagabonds of every low grade , were mingled together in a mass ; the whistling of drovers , the barking dogs , the bellowing and plunging of the oxen , the bleating of sheep , the grunting and squeaking of pigs , the cries of hawkers , the shouts , oaths , and quarrelling on all sides ; the ringing of bells and roar of voices , that issued from every public - house ; the crowding , pushing , driving , beating , whooping and yelling ; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market ; and the unwashed , unshaven , squalid , and dirty figures constantly running to and fro , and bursting in and out of the throng ; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene , which quite confounded the senses . Mr. Sikes , dragging Oliver after him , elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd , and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds , which so astonished the boy . He nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend ; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn .

76689	76695	76697	76699	the same voice	1990	' Aha ! my pal ! '
76701	76724	76697	76699	the same voice	1990	' A glim , Barney , a glim ! Show the gentleman in , Barney ; wake up first , if convenient . '
76782	76787	76789	76791	the same voice	1990	' Do you hear ? '
76793	76846	76789	76791	the same voice	1990	' There 's Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him ; and you sleeping there , as if you took laudanum with your meals , and nothing stronger . Are you any fresher now , or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly ? '
76926	76930	76932	76932	Barney	195	' Bister Sikes ! '
76940	76950	76932	76932	Barney	195	' cub i d , sir ; cub i d. '

77235	77269	77270	77271	The boy	437	' Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise , as his eyes rested on Oliver , Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was . '
77277	77288	77289	77292	Wud of Bister Fagid	218	' replied Sikes , drawing a chair towards the fire . '
77296	77304	77289	77292	Wud of Bister Fagid	218	' exclaimed Barney , with a grin . '
77310	77318	77289	77292	Wud of Bister Fagid	218	' exclaimed Toby , looking at Oliver . '
77331	77341	77328	77330	the old ladies	2006	' pockets in chapels ! His mug is a fortin '
77345	77346	77328	77330	the old ladies	2006	' '
77355	77394	77289	77292	Wud of Bister Fagid	218	' interposed Sikes , impatiently ; and stooping over his recumbant friend , he whispered a few words in his ear : at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely , and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment . '
77397	77407	77409	77409	you	2007	' said Sikes , as he resumed his seat , '
77420	77471	77472	77472	Oliver	123	're waiting , you 'll put some heart in us ; or in me , at all events . Sit down by the fire , younker , and rest yourself ; for you 'll have to go out with us again to - night , though not very far off . '
77513	77516	77518	77518	Toby	209	' Here , '
77537	77543	77544	77544	He	209	' Success to the crack ! '
77585	77592	77594	77594	Toby	209	' A drain for the boy , '
77604	77611	77594	77594	Toby	209	' Down with it , innocence . '
77612	77615	77617	77617	Oliver	123	' Indeed , '
77628	77633	77617	77617	Oliver	123	' indeed , I - '
77634	77639	77641	77641	Toby	209	' Down with it ! '
77643	77665	77594	77594	Toby	209	' Do you think I do n't know what 's good for you ? Tell him to drink it , Bill . '
77666	77671	77673	77673	Sikes	161	' He had better ! '
77681	77709	77673	77673	Sikes	161	' Burn my body , if he is n't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers . Drink it , you perwerse imp ; drink it ! '
77965	77972	77974	77975	Toby Crackit	209	' Barkers for me , Barney , '
77977	77982	77984	77984	Barney	195	' Here they are , '
77992	77998	77984	77984	Barney	195	' You loaded them yourself . '
77999	78003	78005	78005	Toby	209	' All right ! '
78011	78015	78005	78005	Toby	209	' The persuaders ? '
78016	78020	77984	77984	Barney	195	' I 've got 'em
78022	78026	77984	77984	Barney	195	' replied Sikes . '
78040	78058	77984	77984	Barney	195	' inquired Toby : fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat . '
78062	78067	77984	77984	Barney	195	' rejoined his companion . '
78083	78115	77984	77984	Barney	195	' With these words , he took a thick stick from Barney 's hands , who , having delivered another to Toby , busied himself in fastening on Oliver 's cape . '
78119	78166	78172	78172	Toby	209	' said Sikes , holding out his hand . Oliver : who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise , and the air , and the drink which had been forced upon him : put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose . '
78174	78178	78172	78172	Toby	209	' said Sikes . '
78184	78335	78182	78182	Barney	195	' The man went to the door , and returned to announce that all was quiet . The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them . Barney , having made all fast , rolled himself up as before , and was soon asleep again . It was now intensely dark . The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night ; and the atmosphere was so damp , that , although no rain fell , Oliver 's hair and eyebrows , within a few minutes after leaving the house , had become stiff with the half - frozen moisture that was floating about . They crossed the bridge , and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before . They were at no great distance off ; and , as they walked pretty briskly , they soon arrived at Chertsey . '
78341	78345	78182	78182	Barney	195	' whispered Sikes ; '
78362	78488	78489	78490	The boy	437	' Toby acquiesced ; and they hurried through the main street of the little town , which at that late hour was wholly deserted . A dim light shone at intervals from some bed - room window ; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night . But there was nobody abroad . They had cleared the town , as the church - bell struck two . Quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand . After walking about a quarter of a mile , they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall : to the top of which , Toby Crackit , scarcely pausing to take breath , climbed in a twinkling . '
78493	78497	78489	78490	The boy	437	' said Toby . '
78509	78636	78502	78502	I	0	' Before Oliver had time to look round , Sikes had caught him under the arms ; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side . Sikes followed directly . And they stole cautiously towards the house . And now , for the first time , Oliver , well - nigh mad with grief and terror , saw that housebreaking and robbery , if not murder , were the objects of the expedition . He clasped his hands together , and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror . A mist came before his eyes ; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face ; his limbs failed him ; and he sank upon his knees . '
78640	78656	78502	78502	I	0	' murmured Sikes , trembling with rage , and drawing the pistol from his pocket ; '
78670	78671	78661	78661	I	0	' '
78682	78686	78675	78675	God	167	' cried Oliver ; '
78741	78787	78837	78837	Bill	161	' The man to whom this appeal was made , swore a dreadful oath , and had cocked the pistol , when Toby , striking it from his grasp , placed his hand upon the boy 's mouth , and dragged him to the house . '
78790	78795	78837	78837	Bill	161	' cried the man ; '
78878	79038	78857	78861	older hands of his age	2027	' Sikes , invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin 's head for sending Oliver on such an errand , plied the crowbar vigorously , but with little noise . After some delay , and some assistance from Toby , the shutter to which he had referred , swung open on its hinges . It was a little lattice window , about five feet and a half above the ground , at the back of the house : which belonged to a scullery , or small brewing - place , at the end of the passage . The aperture was so small , that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely ; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver 's size , nevertheless . A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike 's art , sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice ; and it soon stood wide open also . '
79046	79068	79069	79069	I	0	' whispered Sikes , drawing a dark lantern from his pocket , and throwing the glare full on Oliver 's face ; '
79070	79111	78857	78861	older hands of his age	2027	'm a going to put you through there . Take this light ; go softly up the steps straight afore you , and along the little hall , to the street door ; unfasten it , and let us in . '
79112	79129	79131	79131	Toby	209	' There 's a bolt at the top , you wo n't be able to reach , '
79133	79159	79131	79131	Toby	209	' Stand upon one of the hall chairs . There are three there , Bill , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em
79169	79170	79131	79131	Toby	209	' '
79178	79187	79131	79131	Toby	209	' replied Sikes , with a threatening look . '
79198	79199	79259	79259	Barney	195	' '
79202	79213	79259	79259	Barney	195	' replied Toby , after peeping in to satisfy himself . '
79260	79271	79259	79259	Barney	195	' ticed him away to - night . So neat ! '
79390	79395	79397	79397	Sikes	161	' Take this lantern , '
79404	79412	79397	79397	Sikes	161	' You see the stairs afore you ? '
79423	79426	79427	79427	Sikes	161	' Yes . '
79469	79477	79479	79479	Sikes	161	' It 's done in a minute , '
79487	79501	79479	79479	Sikes	161	' Directly I leave go of you , do your work . Hark ! '
79502	79507	79509	79511	the other man	2037	' What 's that ? '
79517	79520	79522	79522	Sikes	161	' Nothing , '
79530	79533	79522	79522	Sikes	161	' Now ! '
79592	79596	79599	79599	Sikes	161	' Come back ! '
79602	79607	79599	79599	Sikes	161	' Back ! back ! '
79746	79752	79754	79754	Sikes	161	' Clasp your arm tighter , '
79764	79783	79757	79757	he	161	' Give me a shawl here . They 've hit him . Quick ! How the boy bleeds ! '
80195	80198	80200	80201	the matron	2062	' Well ! '
80217	80219	80200	80201	the matron	2062	' I 'm
80247	80339	80200	80201	the matron	2062	' Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it ; and thrusting a silver spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a two - ounce tin tea - caddy , proceeded to make the tea . How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds ! The black teapot , being very small and easily filled , ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising ; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney 's hand . '
80344	80359	80200	80201	the matron	2062	' said the worthy matron , setting it down very hastily on the hob ; '
80384	80391	80380	80380	anybody	435	' said Mrs. Corney , pausing , '
80404	80471	80472	80472	I	0	' With these words , the matron dropped into her chair , and , once more resting her elbow on the table , thought of her solitary fate . The small teapot , and the single cup , had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney who had not been dead more than five - and - twenty years ; and she was overpowered . '
80478	80485	80493	80493	him	2065	' said Mrs. Corney , pettishly ; '
80495	80557	80493	80493	him	2065	' Whether this remark bore reference to the husband , or the teapot , is uncertain . It might have been the latter ; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke ; and took it up afterwards . She had just tasted her first cup , when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room - door . '
80565	80572	80493	80493	him	2065	' said Mrs. Corney , sharply . '
80588	80613	80493	80493	him	2065	'm at meals . Do n't stand there , letting the cold air in , do n't . What 's amiss now , eh ? '
80614	80621	80623	80624	a man	469	' Nothing , ma'am , nothing , '
80628	80632	80634	80635	the matron	2062	' Dear me ! '
80643	80649	80634	80635	the matron	2062	' is that Mr. Bumble ? '
80650	80657	80659	80660	Mr. Bumble	130	' At your service , ma'am , '
80703	80712	80713	80714	The lady	679	' Shall I shut the door , ma'am ? '
80757	80764	80766	80767	the matron	2062	' Hard weather , Mr. Bumble , '
80769	80776	80778	80779	the beadle	389	' Hard , indeed , ma'am , '
80781	80828	80778	80779	the beadle	389	' Anti - porochial weather this , ma'am . We have given away , Mrs. Corney , we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half , this very blessed afternoon ; and yet them paupers are not contented . '
80829	80842	80844	80845	the matron	2062	' Of course not . When would they be , Mr. Bumble ? '
80851	80858	80860	80861	Mr. Bumble	130	' When , indeed , ma'am ! '
80863	80952	80860	80861	Mr. Bumble	130	' Why here 's one man that , in consideration of his wife and large family , has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese , full weight . Is he grateful , ma'am ? Is he grateful ? Not a copper farthing 's worth of it ! What does he do , ma'am , but ask for a few coals ; if it 's only a pocket handkerchief full , he says ! Coals ! What would he do with coals ? Toast his cheese with 'em
80971	81001	81002	81003	The matron	2062	'em a apron full of coals to - day , and they 'll come back for another , the day after to - morrow , as brazen as alabaster . '
81019	81023	81025	81026	Mr. Bumble	130	' I never , '
81028	81181	81025	81026	Mr. Bumble	130	' see anything like the pitch it 's got to . The day afore yesterday , a man - you have been a married woman , ma'am , and I may mention it to you - a man , with hardly a rag upon his back here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor , goes to our overseer 's door when he has got company coming to dinner ; and says , he must be relieved , Mrs. Corney . As he would n't go away , and shocked the company very much , our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal . " My heart ! " says the ungrateful villain , " what 's the use of this to me ? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles ! " " Very good , " says our overseer , taking 'em
81222	81223	81219	81220	our overseer	6371	' '
81242	81247	81235	81236	Mr. Grannett	223	' interposed the matron . '
81253	81254	81250	81251	Mr. Bumble	130	' '
81259	81264	81265	81265	he	223	' rejoined the beadle , '
81285	81286	81279	81281	a obstinate pauper	2084	' '
81295	81301	81279	81281	a obstinate pauper	2084	' observed the matron emphatically . '
81325	81338	81345	81346	the beadle	389	're a gentleman of experience , and ought to know . Come . '
81339	81343	81345	81346	the beadle	389	' Mrs. Corney , '
81359	81411	81345	81346	the beadle	389	' out - of - door relief , properly managed : properly managed , ma'am : is the porochial safeguard . The great principle of out - of - door relief is , to give the paupers exactly what they do n't want ; and then they get tired of coming . '
81412	81416	81418	81419	Mrs. Corney	221	' Dear me ! '
81421	81432	81418	81419	Mrs. Corney	221	' Well , that is a good one , too ! '
81433	81443	81445	81446	Mr. Bumble	130	' Yes . Betwixt you and me , ma'am , '
81448	81508	81510	81511	the beadle	389	' that 's the great principle ; and that 's the reason why , if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers , you 'll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese . That 's the rule now , Mrs. Corney , all over the country . But , however , '
81519	81590	81510	81511	the beadle	389	' these are official secrets , ma'am ; not to be spoken of ; except , as I may say , among the porochial officers , such as ourselves . This is the port wine , ma'am , that the board ordered for the infirmary ; real , fresh , genuine port wine ; only out of the cask this forenoon ; clear as a bell , and no sediment ! '
81651	81663	81665	81666	the matron	2062	' You 'll have a very cold walk , Mr. Bumble , '
81668	81674	81676	81677	Mr. Bumble	130	' It blows , ma'am , '
81686	81695	81676	81677	Mr. Bumble	130	' enough to cut one 's ears off . '
81858	81864	81866	81867	the matron	2062	' Sweet ? Mr. Bumble ? '
81876	81884	81886	81887	Mr. Bumble	130	' Very sweet , indeed , ma'am , '
81999	82010	82012	82013	Mr. Bumble	130	' You have a cat , ma'am , I see , '
82033	82041	82012	82013	Mr. Bumble	130	' and kittens too , I declare ! '
82042	82058	82060	82061	the matron	2062	' I am so fond of them , Mr. Bumble , you ca n't think , '
82063	82065	82060	82061	the matron	2062	' They 're
82084	82085	82077	82077	they	2101	' '
82092	82099	82090	82090	ma'am	4974	' replied Mr. Bumble , approvingly ; '
82104	82105	82060	82061	the matron	2062	' '
82110	82117	82060	82061	the matron	2062	' rejoined the matron with enthusiasm ; '
82133	82136	82132	82132	I	0	'm sure . '
82137	82143	82145	82146	Mr. Bumble	130	' Mrs. Corney , ma'am , '
82158	82197	82145	82146	Mr. Bumble	130	' I mean to say this , ma'am ; that any cat , or kitten , that could live with you , ma'am , and not be fond of its home , must be a ass , ma'am . '
82198	82204	82206	82207	Mrs. Corney	221	' Oh , Mr. Bumble ! '
82209	82220	82222	82223	Mr. Bumble	130	' It 's of no use disguising facts , ma'am , '
82241	82251	82237	82237	him	130	' I would drown it myself , with pleasure . '
82252	82255	82145	82146	Mr. Bumble	130	' Then you 're
82260	82278	82256	82258	a cruel man	2104	' said the matron vivaciously , as she held out her hand for the beadle 's cup ; '
82288	82289	82280	82285	a very hard - hearted man	2105	' '
82296	82301	82280	82285	a very hard - hearted man	2105	' said Mr. Bumble . '
82304	82712	82717	82718	Mrs. Corney	221	' Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word ; squeezed Mrs. Corney 's little finger as she took it ; and inflicting two open - handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat , gave a mighty sigh , and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire . It was a round table ; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other , with no great space between them , and fronting the fire , it will be seen that Mr. Bumble , in receding from the fire , and still keeping at the table , increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney ; which proceeding , some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire , and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble 's part : he being in some sort tempted by time , place , and opportunity , to give utterance to certain soft nothings , which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless , do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land , members of parliament , ministers of state , lord mayors , and other great public functionaries , but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle : who as is well known should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all . Whatever were Mr. Bumble 's intentions , however and no doubt they were of the best : it unfortunately happened , as has been twice before remarked , that the table was a round one ; consequently Mr. Bumble , moving his chair by little and little , soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron ; and , continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle , brought his chair , in time , close to that in which the matron was seated . Indeed , the two chairs touched ; and when they did so , Mr. Bumble stopped . Now , if the matron had moved her chair to the right , she would have been scorched by the fire ; and if to the left , she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble 's arms ; so being a discreet matron , and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was , and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea . '
82720	82738	82740	82740	you	221	' said Mr. Bumble , stirring his tea , and looking up into the matron 's face ; '
82748	82749	82740	82740	you	221	' '
82753	82758	82740	82740	you	221	' exclaimed the matron , '
82780	82814	82777	82778	Mr. Bumble	130	' The beadle drank his tea to the last drop ; finished a piece of toast ; whisked the crumbs off his knees ; wiped his lips ; and deliberately kissed the matron . '
82818	82842	82843	82844	Mr. Bumble	130	' cried that discreet lady in a whisper ; for the fright was so great , that she had quite lost her voice , '
82850	82984	82846	82846	I	0	' Mr. Bumble made no reply ; but in a slow and dignified manner , put his arm round the matron 's waist . As the lady had stated her intention of screaming , of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness , but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door : which was no sooner heard , than Mr. Bumble darted , with much agility , to the wine bottles , and began dusting them with great violence : while the matron sharply demanded who was there . It is worthy of remark , as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear , that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity . '
82991	83010	82986	82986	you	130	' said a withered old female pauper , hideously ugly : putting her head in at the door , '
83019	83020	83011	83012	Old Sally	224	' '
83029	83035	83036	83036	I	0	' angrily demanded the matron . '
83046	83047	83044	83044	I	0	' '
83054	83060	83061	83061	nobody	354	' replied the old woman , '
83158	83716	83147	83147	She	224	' At this intelligence , the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who could n't even die without purposely annoying their betters ; and , muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up , briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back , lest anything particular should occur . Bidding the messenger walk fast , and not be all night hobbling up the stairs , she followed her from the room with a very ill grace , scolding all the way . Mr. Bumble 's conduct on being left to himself , was rather inexplicable . He opened the closet , counted the teaspoons , weighed the sugar - tongs , closely inspected a silver milk - pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal , and , having satisfied his curiosity on these points , put on his cocked hat corner - wise , and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table . Having gone through this very extraordinary performance , he took off the cocked hat again , and , spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it , seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture . CHAPTER XXIV TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT . BUT IS A SHORT ONE , AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY It was no unfit messenger of death , who had disturbed the quiet of the matron 's room . Her body was bent by age ; her limbs trembled with palsy ; her face , distorted into a mumbling leer , resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil , than the work of Nature 's hand . Alas ! How few of Nature 's faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty ! The cares , and sorrows , and hungerings , of the world , change them as they change hearts ; and it is only when those passions sleep , and have lost their hold for ever , that the troubled clouds pass off , and leave Heaven 's surface clear . It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead , even in that fixed and rigid state , to subside into the long - forgotten expression of sleeping infancy , and settle into the very look of early life ; so calm , so peaceful , do they grow again , that those who knew them in their happy childhood , kneel by the coffin 's side in awe , and see the Angel even upon earth . The old crone tottered along the passages , and up the stairs , muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion ; being at length compelled to pause for breath , she gave the light into her hand , and remained behind to follow as she might : while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay . It was a bare garret - room , with a dim light burning at the farther end . There was another old woman watching by the bed ; the parish apothecary 's apprentice was standing by the fire , making a toothpick out of a quill . '
83723	83734	83720	83721	Mrs. Corney	221	' said this young gentleman , as the matron entered . '
83742	83761	83720	83721	Mrs. Corney	221	' replied the mistress , in her most civil tones , and dropping a curtsey as she spoke . '
83772	83793	83720	83721	Mrs. Corney	221	' said the apothecary 's deputy , breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker ; '
83808	83809	83810	83810	They	2116	' '
83811	83819	83821	83822	the matron	2062	're the board 's choosing , sir , '
83824	83846	83821	83822	the matron	2062	' The least they could do , would be to keep us pretty warm : for our places are hard enough . '
83860	83863	83865	83867	the young mag	2119	' Oh ! '
83886	83896	83878	83878	he	2119	' it 's all U.P. there , Mrs. Corney . '
83897	83906	83908	83909	the matron	2062	' It is , is it , sir ? '
83911	83925	83927	83930	the apothecary 's apprentice	2123	' If she lasts a couple of hours , I shall be surprised , '
83939	83958	83959	83960	The attendant	2124	' It 's a break - up of the system altogether . Is she dozing , old lady ? '
83975	83994	83996	83998	the young man	1803	' Then perhaps she 'll go off in that way , if you do n't make a row , '
84000	84015	83996	83998	the young man	1803	' Put the light on the floor . She wo n't see it there . '
84209	84224	84226	84227	the messenger	6432	' Did she say any more , Anny dear , while I was gone ? '
84229	84234	84236	84237	the other	4696	' Not a word , '
84239	84300	84236	84237	the other	4696	' She plucked and tore at her arms for a little time ; but I held her hands , and she soon dropped off . She has n't much strength in her , so I easily kept her quiet . I ai n't so weak for an old woman , although I am on parish allowance ; no , no ! '
84301	84316	84318	84319	the first	2136	' Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have ? '
84321	84329	84331	84332	the other	4696	' I tried to get it down , '
84334	84375	84331	84332	the other	4696	' But her teeth were tight set , and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again . So I drank it ; and it did me good ! '
84401	84407	84409	84411	the first speaker	2140	' I mind the time , '
84413	84430	84409	84411	the first speaker	2140	' when she would have done the same , and made rare fun of it afterwards . '
84431	84438	84440	84441	the other	4696	' Ay , that she would , '
84443	84450	84440	84441	the other	4696	' she had a merry heart . '
84496	84597	84487	84487	I	0	' Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke , the old creature shook them exultingly before her face , and fumbling in her pocket , brought out an old time - discoloured tin snuff - box , from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion , and a few more into her own . While they were thus employed , the matron , who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor , joined them by the fire , and sharply asked how long she was to wait ? '
84603	84615	84601	84601	mistress	2108	' replied the second woman , looking up into her face . '
84641	84642	84631	84631	He	2146	' '
84651	84657	84658	84658	You	2108	' said the matron sternly . '
84673	84674	84666	84666	she	2146	' '
84677	84683	84666	84666	she	2146	' answered the first woman . '
84690	84696	84658	84658	You	2108	' added the second one ; '
84720	84721	84711	84711	mistress	2108	' '
84726	84733	84734	84734	she	2146	' said the matron , snappishly , '
84814	84856	84810	84810	I	0	' She was bouncing away , when a cry from the two women , who had turned towards the bed , caused her to look round . The patient had raised herself upright , and was stretching her arms towards them . '
84861	84870	84810	84810	I	0	' she cried , in a hollow voice . '
84875	84886	84810	84810	I	0	' said one of the women , stooping over her . '
84893	84894	84895	84895	I	0	' '
84903	84910	84895	84895	I	0	' said the woman , struggling . '
84928	84973	84922	84922	me	0	' She clutched the matron by the arm , and forcing her into a chair by the bedside , was about to speak , when looking round , she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners . '
84978	84985	84922	84922	me	0	' said the woman , drowsily ; '
84992	85134	84922	84922	me	0	' The two old crones , chiming in together , began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends ; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her , when the superior pushed them from the room , closed the door , and returned to the bedside . On being excluded , the old ladies changed their tone , and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk ; which , indeed , was not unlikely ; since , in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary , she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin - and - water which had been privily administered , in the openness of their hearts , by the worthy old ladies themselves . '
85140	85161	85138	85138	me	0	' said the dying woman aloud , as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy . '
85179	85224	85233	85235	the impatient auditor	2158	' , that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking , and all soiled with dust and blood . She gave birth to a boy , and died . Let me think - what was the year again ! '
85225	85231	85233	85235	the impatient auditor	2158	' Never mind the year , '
85237	85242	85233	85235	the impatient auditor	2158	' what about her ? '
85243	85246	85248	85250	the sick woman	6449	' Ay , '
85259	85271	85272	85272	she	6449	' what about her ? - what about - I know ! '
85291	85318	85284	85284	her	6449	' I robbed her , so I did ! She was n't cold - I tell you she was n't cold , when I stole it ! '
85319	85328	85330	85331	the matron	2062	' Stole what , for God 's sake ? '
85344	85347	85349	85350	the woman	2127	' It ! '
85361	85413	85353	85353	her	2127	' The only thing she had . She wanted clothes to keep her warm , and food to eat ; but she had kept it safe , and had it in her bosom . It was gold , I tell you ! Rich gold , that might have saved her life ! '
85414	85417	85419	85420	the matron	2062	' Gold ! '
85432	85454	85419	85420	the matron	2062	' Go on , go on - yes - what of it ? Who was the mother ? When was it ? '
85455	85464	85466	85467	the woman	2127	' She charge me to keep it safe , '
85472	85527	85466	85467	the woman	2127	' and trusted me as the only woman about her . I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck ; and the child 's death , perhaps , is on me besides ! They would have treated him better , if they had known it all ! '
85528	85532	85534	85535	the other	4696	' Known what ? '
85537	85540	85466	85467	the woman	2127	' Speak ! '
85541	85550	85552	85553	the woman	2127	' The boy grew so like his mother , '
85564	85613	85552	85553	the woman	2127	' that I could never forget it when I saw his face . Poor girl ! poor girl ! She was so young , too ! Such a gentle lamb ! Wait ; there 's more to tell . I have not told you all , have I ? '
85614	85619	85621	85622	the matron	2062	' No , no , '
85642	85653	85625	85625	her	2062	' Be quick , or it may be too late ! '
85654	85658	85660	85661	the woman	2127	' The mother , '
85671	85771	85660	85661	the woman	2127	' the mother , when the pains of death first came upon her , whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive , and thrived , the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named . " And oh , kind Heaven ! " she said , folding her thin hands together , " whether it be boy or girl , raise up some friends for it in this troubled world , and take pity upon a lonely desolate child , abandoned to its mercy ! " '
85772	85778	85780	85781	the matron	2062	' The boy 's name ? '
85783	85789	85791	85792	the woman	2127	' They called him Oliver , '
85796	85803	85791	85792	the woman	2127	' The gold I stole was - '
85804	85811	85816	85816	She	2173	' Yes , yes - what ? '
85873	85877	85879	85883	one of the old women	2175	' Stone dead ! '
85895	85904	85906	85907	the matron	2062	' And nothing to tell , after all , '
86341	86344	86298	86299	the Artful	5843	' blowed , '
86447	86456	86458	86459	Mr. Chitling	208	' That 's two doubles and the rub , '
86481	86512	86468	86468	he	208	' I never see such a feller as you , Jack ; you win everything . Even when we 've good cards , Charley and I ca n't make nothing of 'em
86514	86560	86468	86468	he	208	' Either the master or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted Charley Bates so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter . '

86697	86714	86694	86695	the Jew	1006	' you must get up very early in the morning , to win against the Dodger . '

86723	86759	86720	86721	Charley Bates	179	' you must put your boots on over - night , and have a telescope at each eye , and a opera - glass between your shoulders , if you want to come over him . '
86846	86855	86857	86858	the Dodger	5121	' How precious dull you are , Tommy ! '
86875	86887	86857	86858	the Dodger	5121	' What do you think he 's thinking of , Fagin ? '
86888	86897	86899	86900	the Jew	1006	' How should I know , my dear ? '
86910	86943	86899	86900	the Jew	1006	' About his losses , maybe ; or the little retirement in the country that he 's just left , eh ? Ha ! ha ! Is that it , my dear ? '
86944	86951	86953	86954	the Dodger	5121	' Not a bit of it , '
86969	86977	86962	86963	Mr. Chitling	208	' What do you say , Charley ? '
86978	86983	86985	86986	Master Bates	179	' I should say , '
86992	87039	86985	86986	Master Bates	179	' that he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy . See how he 's a - blushing ! Oh , my eye ! here 's a merry - go - rounder ! Tommy Chitling 's in love ! Oh , Fagin , Fagin ! what a spree ! '
87112	87120	87122	87123	the Jew	1006	' Never mind him , my dear , '
87144	87163	87132	87133	Master Bates	179	' Betsy 's a fine girl . Stick up to her , Tom . Stick up to her . '
87164	87173	87175	87176	Mr. Chitling	208	' What I mean to say , Fagin , '
87184	87196	87175	87176	Mr. Chitling	208	' is , that that is n't anything to anybody here . '
87197	87203	87205	87206	the Jew	1006	' No more it is , '
87208	87247	87205	87206	the Jew	1006	' Charley will talk . Do n't mind him , my dear ; do n't mind him . Betsy 's a fine girl . Do as she bids you , Tom , and you will make your fortune . '

87263	87338	87260	87261	Mr. Chitling	208	' I should n't have been milled , if it had n't been for her advice . But it turned out a good job for you ; did n't it , Fagin ! And what 's six weeks of it ? It must come , some time or another , and why not in the winter time when you do n't want to go out a - walking so much ; eh , Fagin ? '
87339	87349	87351	87352	the Jew	1006	' Ah , to be sure , my dear , '
87354	87367	87369	87370	the Dodger	5121	' You would n't mind it again , Tom , would you , '
87379	87386	87369	87370	the Dodger	5121	' if Bet was all right ? '
87387	87397	87399	87399	Tom	207	' I mean to say that I should n't , '
87403	87428	87399	87399	Tom	207	' There , now . Ah ! Who 'll say as much as that , I should like to know ; eh , Fagin ? '
87429	87435	87437	87438	the Jew	1006	' Nobody , my dear , '
87440	87453	87437	87438	the Jew	1006	' not a soul , Tom . I do n't know one of 'em
87464	87469	87399	87399	Tom	207	'em , my dear . '
87470	87491	87494	87499	the poor half - witted dupe	2207	' I might have got clear off , if I 'd split upon her ; might n't I , Fagin ? '
87501	87517	87494	87499	the poor half - witted dupe	2207	' A word from me would have done it ; would n't it , Fagin ? '
87518	87528	87530	87531	the Jew	1006	' To be sure it would , my dear , '
87533	87546	87548	87548	Tom	207	' But I did n't blab it ; did I , Fagin ? '
87558	87567	87569	87570	the Jew	1006	' No , no , to be sure , '
87572	87590	87569	87570	the Jew	1006	' you were too stout - hearted for that . A deal too stout , my dear ! '
87591	87596	87598	87598	Tom	207	' Perhaps I was , '
87603	87622	87623	87624	The Jew	1006	' and if I was , what 's to laugh at , in that ; eh , Fagin ? '
87774	87777	87779	87780	the Dodger	5121	' Hark ! '
87785	87791	87779	87780	the Dodger	5121	' I heard the tinkler . '
87833	87836	87838	87839	the Jew	1006	' What ! '
87841	87844	87838	87839	the Jew	1006	' alone ? '
87948	87953	87954	87954	he	5173	' Where is he ? '
87977	87980	87982	87983	the Jew	1006	' Yes , '
87990	88009	87982	87983	the Jew	1006	' bring him down . Hush ! Quiet , Charley ! Gently , Tom ! Scarce , scarce ! '
88106	88113	88115	88116	this worthy	2235	' How are you , Faguey ? '
88123	88167	88115	88116	this worthy	2235	' Pop that shawl away in my castor , Dodger , so that I may know where to find it when I cut ; that 's the time of day ! You 'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now . '
88202	88208	88209	88209	he	2233	' See there , Faguey , '
88219	88293	88209	88209	he	2233	' not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when ; not a bubble of blacking , by Jove ! But do n't look at me in that way , man . All in good time . I ca n't talk about business till I 've eat and drank ; so produce the sustainance , and let 's have a quiet fill - out for the first time these three days ! '
88502	88509	88511	88511	Toby	209	' First and foremost , Faguey , '
88513	88518	88520	88521	the Jew	1006	' Yes , yes ! '
88576	88583	88585	88586	the housebreaker	5863	' First and foremost , Faguey , '
88588	88593	88585	88586	the housebreaker	5863	' how 's Bill ? '
88594	88597	88599	88600	the Jew	1006	' What ! '
88607	88617	88619	88619	Toby	209	' Why , you do n't mean to say - '
88624	88627	88629	88630	the Jew	1006	' Mean ! '
88638	88669	88629	88630	the Jew	1006	' Where are they ? Sikes and the boy ! Where are they ? Where have they been ? Where are they hiding ? Why have they not been here ? '
88670	88675	88677	88677	Toby	209	' The crack failed , '
88680	88685	88687	88688	the Jew	1006	' I know it , '
88701	88705	88687	88688	the Jew	1006	' What more ? '
88706	88757	88629	88630	the Jew	1006	' They fired and hit the boy . We cut over the fields at the back , with him between us - straight as the crow flies - through hedge and ditch . They gave chase . Damme ! the whole country was awake , and the dogs upon us . '
88758	88762	88629	88630	the Jew	1006	' The boy ! '
88763	88838	88839	88840	The Jew	1006	' Bill had him on his back , and scudded like the wind . We stopped to take him between us ; his head hung down , and he was cold . They were close upon our heels ; every man for himself , and each from the gallows ! We parted company , and left the youngster lying in a ditch . Alive or dead , that 's all I know about him . '
89406	89422	89424	89426	this respectable trader	2287	' Why , the sight of you , Mr. Fagin , would cure the hoptalmy ! '
89439	89450	89452	89452	Fagin	174	' The neighbourhood was a little too hot , Lively , '
89466	89482	89484	89485	the trader	2289	' Well , I 've heerd that complaint of it , once or twice before , '
89487	89502	89484	89485	the trader	2289	' but it soon cools down again ; do n't you find it so ? '
89529	89534	89536	89537	the man	4928	' At the Cripples ? '
89543	89548	89550	89551	the merchant	2293	' Let me see , '
89555	89565	89550	89551	the merchant	2293	' Yes , there 's some half - dozen of 'em
89582	89583	89584	89584	Sikes	161	' '
89591	89601	89588	89588	I	0	' inquired the Jew , with a disappointed countenance . '
89610	89625	89606	89607	the lawyers	2295	' replied the little man , shaking his head , and looking amazingly sly . '
89637	89638	89627	89627	you	0	' '
89644	89652	89627	89627	you	0	' said the Jew , turning away . '
89663	89673	89654	89654	you	0	' cried the little man , calling after him . '
89689	90524	90532	90533	Mr. Fagin	174	' But as the Jew , looking back , waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone ; and , moreover , as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair ; the sign of the Cripples was , for a time , bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively 's presence . By the time he had got upon his legs , the Jew had disappeared ; so Mr. Lively , after ineffectually standing on tiptoe , in the hope of catching sight of him , again forced himself into the little chair , and , exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop , in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled , resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour . The Three Cripples , or rather the Cripples ; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons : was the public - house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured . Merely making a sign to a man at the bar , Fagin walked straight upstairs , and opening the door of a room , and softly insinuating himself into the chamber , looked anxiously about : shading his eyes with his hand , as if in search of some particular person . The room was illuminated by two gas - lights ; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters , and closely - drawn curtains of faded red , from being visible outside . The ceiling was blackened , to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps ; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke , that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more . By degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out ; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table : at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand ; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner . As Fagin stepped softly in , the professional gentleman , running over the keys by way of prelude , occasioned a general cry of order for a song ; which having subsided , a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses , between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through , as loud as he could . When this was over , the chairman gave a sentiment , after which , the professional gentleman on the chairman 's right and left volunteered a duet , and sang it , with great applause . It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group . There was the chairman himself , the landlord of the house , a coarse , rough , heavy built fellow , who , while the songs were proceeding , rolled his eyes hither and thither , and , seeming to give himself up to joviality , had an eye for everything that was done , and an ear for everything that was said - and sharp ones , too . Near him were the singers : receiving , with professional indifference , the compliments of the company , and applying themselves , in turn , to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water , tendered by their more boisterous admirers ; whose countenances , expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade , irresistibly attracted the attention , by their very repulsiveness . Cunning , ferocity , and drunkeness in all its stages , were there , in their strongest aspect ; and women : some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked : others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out , and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime ; some mere girls , others but young women , and none past the prime of life ; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture . Fagin , troubled by no grave emotions , looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress ; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search . Succeeding , at length , in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair , he beckoned to him slightly , and left the room , as quietly as he had entered it . '
90535	90549	90532	90533	Mr. Fagin	174	' inquired the man , as he followed him out to the landing . '
90564	90566	90567	90568	The Jew	1006	'em . '
90580	90585	90570	90570	his	1006	' Is he here ? '
90586	90589	90591	90592	the man	4928	' No , '
90594	90601	90603	90603	Fagin	174	' And no news of Barney ? '
90605	90608	90610	90614	the landlord of the Cripples	2300	' None , '
90621	90637	90619	90619	he	2300	' He wo n't stir till it 's all safe . Depend on it , they 're
90693	90694	90676	90676	I	0	' '
90703	90718	90719	90719	Monks	135	' asked the Jew , laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before . '
90725	90732	90719	90719	Monks	135	' inquired the landlord , hesitating . '
90735	90740	90719	90719	Monks	135	' said the Jew . '
90743	90744	90719	90719	Monks	135	' '
90747	90760	90719	90719	Monks	135	' replied the man , drawing a gold watch from his fob ; '
90779	90780	90775	90775	he	2300	' '
90785	90815	90817	90817	him	2300	' said the Jew , hastily ; as though , however desirous he might be to see the person in question , he was nevertheless relieved by his absence . '
90857	90858	90817	90817	him	2300	' '
90861	90866	90817	90817	him	2300	' said the man . '
90870	90871	90817	90817	him	2300	' '
90877	90886	90887	90887	I	0	' said the Jew , descending the stairs . '
90890	90907	90887	90887	I	0	' said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper ; '
90935	90936	90918	90918	I	0	' '
90948	90956	90943	90944	Phil Barker	234	' said the Jew , looking up . '
91001	91084	91108	91108	I	0	' The landlord reciprocated the old man 's laugh ; and returned to his guests . The Jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought . After a brief reflection , he called a hack - cabriolet , and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green . He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes 's residence , and performed the short remainder of the distance , on foot . '
91087	91099	91108	91108	I	0	' muttered the Jew , as he knocked at the door , '
91124	91168	91108	91108	I	0	' She was in her room , the woman said . Fagin crept softly upstairs , and entered it without any previous ceremony . The girl was alone ; lying with her head upon the table , and her hair straggling over it . '
91174	91181	91169	91169	She	2307	' thought the Jew , cooly , '
91189	91368	91184	91184	she	2307	' The old man turned to close the door , as he made this reflection ; the noise thus occasioned , roused the girl . She eyed his crafty face narrowly , as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit 's story . When it was concluded , she sank into her former attitude , but spoke not a word . She pushed the candle impatiently away ; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position , shuffled her feet upon the ground ; but this was all . During the silence , the Jew looked restlessly about the room , as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned . Apparently satisfied with his inspection , he coughed twice or thrice , and made as many efforts to open a conversation ; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone . At length he made another attempt ; and rubbing his hands together , said , in his most conciliatory tone , '
91381	91412	91372	91372	you	2308	' The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply , that she could not tell ; and seemed , from the smothered noise that escaped her , to be crying . '
91419	91435	91414	91415	the boy	437	' said the Jew , straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face . '
91450	91451	91452	91453	The child	321	' '
91455	91464	91452	91453	The child	321	' said the girl , suddenly looking up , '
91502	91503	91485	91485	I	0	' '
91506	91514	91485	91485	I	0	' cried the Jew , in amazement . '
91520	91529	91517	91517	I	0	' returned the girl , meeting his gaze . '
91575	91576	91598	91599	the girl	5742	' '
91579	91586	91587	91587	You	0	' said the Jew , scornfully . '
91588	91591	91598	91599	the girl	5742	're drunk . '
91592	91596	91598	91599	the girl	5742	' Am I ? '
91602	91644	91598	91599	the girl	5742	' It 's no fault of yours , if I am not ! You 'd never have me anything else , if you had your will , except now ; - the humour does n't suit you , does n't it ? '
91645	91648	91650	91651	the Jew	1006	' No ! '
91655	91660	91650	91651	the Jew	1006	' It does not . '
91661	91667	91669	91670	the girl	5742	' Change it , then ! '
91676	91680	91682	91683	the Jew	1006	' Change it ! '
91703	91807	91682	91683	the Jew	1006	' I will change it ! Listen to me , you drab . Listen to me , who with six words , can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull 's throat between my fingers now . If he comes back , and leaves the boy behind him ; if he gets off free , and dead or alive , fails to restore him to me ; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch . And do it the moment he sets foot in this room , or mind me , it will be too late ! '
91808	91814	91816	91817	the girl	5742	' What is all this ? '
91820	91825	91816	91817	the girl	5742	' What is it ? '
91833	91900	91682	91683	the Jew	1006	' When the boy 's worth hundreds of pounds to me , am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely , through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of ! And me bound , too , to a born devil that only wants the will , and has the power to , to - '
92016	92021	92027	92027	his	1006	' Nancy , dear ! '
92031	92039	92027	92027	his	1006	' Did you mind me , dear ? '
92040	92049	92051	92052	the girl	5742	' Do n't worry me now , Fagin ! '
92059	92107	92055	92055	her	5742	' If Bill has not done it this time , he will another . He has done many a good job for you , and will do many more when he can ; and when he ca n't he wo n't ; so no more about that . '
92108	92116	92118	92119	the Jew	1006	' Regarding this boy , my dear ? '
92130	92141	92143	92143	Nancy	127	' The boy must take his chance with the rest , '
92147	92207	92143	92143	Nancy	127	' and I say again , I hope he is dead , and out of harm 's way , and out of yours , - that is , if Bill comes to no harm . And if Toby got clear off , Bill 's pretty sure to be safe ; for Bill 's worth two of Toby any time . '
92208	92219	92221	92222	the Jew	1006	' And about what I was saying , my dear ? '
92232	92251	92253	92253	Nancy	127	' Your must say it all over again , if it 's anything you want me to do , '
92255	92281	92253	92253	Nancy	127	' and if it is , you had better wait till to - morrow . You put me up for a minute ; but now I 'm
92285	92460	92253	92253	Nancy	127	' Fagin put several other questions : all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints ; but , she answered them so readily , and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks , that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor , was confirmed . Nancy , indeed , was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew 's female pupils ; and in which , in their tenderer years , they were rather encouraged than checked . Her disordered appearance , and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment , afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew 's supposition ; and when , after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described , she subsided , first into dullness , and afterwards into a compound of feelings : under the influence of which she shed tears one minute , and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of '
92465	92730	92731	92731	Fagin	174	' and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy , Mr. Fagin , who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time , saw , with great satisfaction , that she was very far gone indeed . Having eased his mind by this discovery ; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had , that night , heard , and of ascertaining , with his own eyes , that Sikes had not returned , Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward : leaving his young friend asleep , with her head upon the table . It was within an hour of midnight . The weather being dark , and piercing cold , he had no great temptation to loiter . The sharp wind that scoured the streets , seemed to have cleared them of passengers , as of dust and mud , for few people were abroad , and they were to all appearance hastening fast home . It blew from the right quarter for the Jew , however , and straight before it he went : trembling , and shivering , as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way . He had reached the corner of his own street , and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door - key , when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow , and , crossing the road , glided up to him unperceived . '
92733	92742	92731	92731	Fagin	174	' whispered a voice close to his ear . '
92745	92754	92731	92731	Fagin	174	' said the Jew , turning quickly round , '
92758	92759	92731	92731	Fagin	174	' '
92762	92767	92731	92731	Fagin	174	' interrupted the stranger . '
92784	92785	92781	92781	you	0	' '
92793	92812	92781	92781	you	0	' replied the Jew , glancing uneasily at his companion , and slackening his pace as he spoke . '
92819	92820	92781	92781	you	0	' '
92826	92835	92781	92781	you	0	' said the stranger , with a sneer . '
92845	92846	92859	92859	I	0	' '
92850	92855	92859	92859	I	0	' said the Jew . '
92862	93008	92859	92859	I	0	' said the stranger , stopping short , and turning a startled look on his companion . The Jew shook his head , and was about to reply , when the stranger , interrupting him , motioned to the house , before which they had by this time arrived : remarking , that he had better say what he had got to say , under cover : for his blood was chilled with standing about so long , and the wind blew through him . Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour ; and , indeed , muttered something about having no fire ; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner , he unlocked the door , and requested him to close it softly , while he got a light . '
93017	93028	92859	92859	I	0	' said the man , groping forward a few steps . '

93038	93059	92859	92859	I	0	' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage . As he spoke , it closed with a loud noise . '

93116	93173	93103	93103	I	0	' Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs . After a short absence , he returned with a lighted candle , and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below , and that the boys were in the front one . Beckoning the man to follow him , he led the way upstairs . '
93191	93205	93180	93180	we	2331	' said the Jew , throwing open a door on the first floor ; '
93235	93467	93468	93468	I	0	' With those words , the Jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door . This done , he led the way into the apartment ; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm - chair , and an old couch or sofa without covering , which stood behind the door . Upon this piece of furniture , the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man ; and the Jew , drawing up the arm - chair opposite , they sat face to face . It was not quite dark ; the door was partially open ; and the candle outside , threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall . They conversed for some time in whispers . Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there , a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger ; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation . They might have been talking , thus , for a quarter of an hour or more , when Monks - by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy - said , raising his voice a little , '
93500	93501	93504	93504	him	2337	' '
93506	93515	93504	93504	him	2337	' exclaimed the Jew , shrugging his shoulders . '
93535	93541	93519	93519	you	2336	' demanded Monks , sternly . '

93600	93606	93607	93607	Mine	2341	' inquired the Jew humbly . '
93609	93613	93607	93607	Mine	2341	' replied Monks . '
93618	93625	93616	93616	mine	0	' said the Jew , submissively . '

93915	93921	93912	93913	the girl	5742	' said Monks , impatiently . '
93937	93944	93924	93924	we	2346	' replied the Jew , smiling ; '
94037	94049	94010	94010	You	583	' said the Jew , drawing nearer to the other , - '
94072	94073	94010	94010	You	583	' '
94084	94106	94010	94010	You	583	' interposed the other man , with a look of terror , and clasping the Jew 's arm with trembling hands . '
94175	94176	94210	94211	the man	4928	' '
94179	94202	94210	94211	the man	4928	' cried the Jew , grasping the coward round the body , with both arms , as he sprung to his feet . '

94219	94245	94210	94211	the man	4928	' The shadow ! I saw the shadow of a woman , in a cloak and bonnet , pass along the wainscot like a breath ! '
94302	94308	94310	94311	the Jew	1006	' It 's your fancy , '
94323	94331	94333	94333	Monks	135	' I 'll swear I saw it ! '
94337	94357	94358	94359	The Jew	1006	' It was bending forward when I saw it first ; and when I spoke , it darted away . '
94446	94453	94455	94456	the Jew	1006	' What do you think now ? '
94465	94485	94455	94456	the Jew	1006	' Besides ourselves , there 's not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys ; and they 're
94492	94985	94989	94994	court - of - law beadles	2373	' As a proof of the fact , the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket ; and explained , that when he first went downstairs , he had locked them in , to prevent any intrusion on the conference . This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks . His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery ; and , now , he gave vent to several very grim laughs , and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination . He declined any renewal of the conversation , however , for that night : suddenly remembering that it was past one o'clock . And so the amiable couple parted . CHAPTER XXVII ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER ; WHICH DESERTED A LADY , MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be , by no means , seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting , with his back to the fire , and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms , until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him ; and as it would still less become his station , or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection , and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words , which , coming from such a quarter , might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree ; the historian whose pen traces these words - trusting that he knows his place , and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated - hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands , and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank , and by consequence great virtues , imperatively claim at his hands . Towards this end , indeed , he had purposed to introduce , in this place , a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles , and elucidative of the position , that a beadle can do no wrong : which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right - minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled , by want of time and space , to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity ; on the arrival of which , he will be prepared to show , that a beadle properly constituted : that is to say , a parochial beadle , attached to a parochial workhouse , and attending in his official capacity the parochial church : is , in right and virtue of his office , possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity ; and that to none of those excellences , can mere companies '

Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet ; and , snatching a pint green - glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated , filled a tea - cup with its contents , and held it to the lady 's lips . '

The dove then turned up his coat - collar , and put on his cocked hat ; and , having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner , once again braved the cold wind of the night : merely pausing , for a few minutes , in the male paupers '

98628	98662	98624	98626	the shorter man	2438	' and whatever Mr. Giles says , it is n't our place to contradict him . No , no , I know my sitiwation ! Thank my stars , I know my sitiwation . '
98704	98711	98713	98714	Mr. Giles	241	' You are afraid , Brittles , '

98724	98728	98730	98730	Giles	241	' You are , '

98747	98753	98755	98756	Mr. Giles	241	're a lie , Brittles , '
98811	98822	98824	98824	he	2442	' I 'll tell you what it is , gentlemen , '
98826	98828	98824	98824	he	2442	' we 're
98832	98833	98798	98800	The third man	2442	' '
98840	98853	98798	98800	The third man	2442	' said Mr. Giles , who was the palest of the party . '
98858	98863	98855	98855	I	0	' replied the man . '
98880	98881	98877	98877	I	0	' '
98886	98890	98884	98884	I	0	' said Brittles ; '
98906	98975	98900	98900	he	469	' These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles , who at once owned that he was afraid ; upon which , they all three faced about , and ran back again with the completest unanimity , until Mr. Giles who had the shortest wind of the party , as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted on stopping , to make an apology for his hastiness of speech . '
98981	98991	98900	98900	he	469	' said Mr. Giles , when he had explained , '
99024	99064	99065	99065	I	0	' As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment ; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again ; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament . '
99071	99076	99065	99065	I	0	' said Mr. Giles ; '
99082	99083	99084	99084	I	0	' '
99092	99101	99084	99084	I	0	' exclaimed Brittles , catching at the idea . '
99108	99112	99102	99102	You	2448	' said Giles , '
99138	100487	99123	99123	I	0	' By a remarkable coincidence , the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment . It was quite obvious , therefore , that it was the gate ; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place , because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance . This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars , and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse , and who had been roused , together with his two mongrel curs , to join in the pursuit . Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion ; Brittles was a lad of all - work : who , having entered her service a mere child , was treated as a promising young boy still , though he was something past thirty . Encouraging each other with such converse as this ; but , keeping very close together , notwithstanding , and looking apprehensively round , whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs ; the three men hurried back to a tree , behind which they had left their lantern , lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire . Catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot ; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne . The air grew colder , as day came slowly on ; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke . The grass was wet ; the pathways , and low places , were all mire and water ; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by , with a hollow moaning . Still , Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him . Morning drew on apace . The air become more sharp and piercing , as its first dull hue - the death of night , rather than the birth of day - glimmered faintly in the sky . The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness , grew more and more defined , and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes . The rain came down , thick and fast , and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes . But , Oliver felt it not , as it beat against him ; for he still lay stretched , helpless and unconscious , on his bed of clay . At length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed ; and uttering it , the boy awoke . His left arm , rudely bandaged in a shawl , hung heavy and useless at his side ; the bandage was saturated with blood . He was so weak , that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture ; when he had done so , he looked feebly round for help , and groaned with pain . Trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright ; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground . After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged , Oliver : urged by a creeping sickness at his heart , which seemed to warn him that if he lay there , he must surely die : got upon his feet , and essayed to walk . His head was dizzy , and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man . But he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither . And now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind . He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit , who were angrily disputing - for the very words they said , sounded in his ears ; and when he caught his own attention , as it were , by making some violent effort to save himself from falling , he found that he was talking to them . Then , he was alone with Sikes , plodding on as on the previous day ; and as shadowy people passed them , he felt the robber 's grasp upon his wrist . Suddenly , he started back at the report of firearms ; there rose into the air , loud cries and shouts ; lights gleamed before his eyes ; all was noise and tumult , as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away . Through all these rapid visions , there ran an undefined , uneasy consciousness of pain , which wearied and tormented him incessantly . Thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge - gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road . Here the rain began to fall so heavily , that it roused him . He looked about , and saw that at no great distance there was a house , which perhaps he could reach . Pitying his condition , they might have compassion on him ; and if they did not , it would be better , he thought , to die near human beings , than in the lonely open fields . He summoned up all his strength for one last trial , and bent his faltering steps towards it . As he drew nearer to this house , a feeling come over him that he had seen it before . He remembered nothing of its details ; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him . That garden wall ! On the grass inside , he had fallen on his knees last night , and prayed the two men 's mercy . It was the very house they had attempted to rob . Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place , that , for the instant , he forgot the agony of his wound , and thought only of flight . Flight ! He could scarcely stand : and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame , whither could he fly ? He pushed against the garden - gate ; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges . He tottered across the lawn ; climbed the steps ; knocked faintly at the door ; and , his whole strength failing him , sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico . It happened that about this time , Mr. Giles , Brittles , and the tinker , were recruiting themselves , after the fatigues and terrors of the night , with tea and sundries , in the kitchen . Not that it was Mr. Giles 's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants : towards whom it was rather his wo nt to deport himself with a lofty affability , which , while it gratified , could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society . But , death , fires , and burglary , make all men equals ; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender , leaning his left arm on the table , while , with his right , he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery , to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid , who were of the party listened with breathless interest . '

100570	100606	100565	100565	I	0	' At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale , and asked the housemaid to shut the door : who asked Brittles , who asked the tinker , who pretended not to hear . '

100762	100770	100771	100771	I	0	' and drew their chairs closer together . '

100855	100893	100894	100894	I	0	' Here , all eyes were turned upon Brittles , who fixed his upon the speaker , and stared at him , with his mouth wide open , and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror . '
100900	100921	100894	100894	I	0	' said Giles , throwing away the table - cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid , '

100942	100947	100939	100940	Mr. Giles	241	' murmured the tinker . '
100954	100970	100939	100940	Mr. Giles	241	' said Giles , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word ; '
101013	101014	100997	100997	I	0	' '
101019	101028	101016	101016	you	0	' observed Brittles , in a low voice . '
101031	101044	101046	101046	Giles	241	're dead men , I think , Brittles , " I says , '
101048	101057	101046	101046	Giles	241	' " but do n't be frightened . " '
101058	101063	101065	101066	the cook	6859	' Was he frightened ? '
101068	101075	101077	101078	Mr. Giles	241	' Not a bit of it , '
101080	101096	101077	101078	Mr. Giles	241	' He was as firm - ah ! pretty near as firm as I was . '
101097	101106	101046	101046	Giles	241	' I should have died at once , I 'm
101115	101120	101121	101121	You	0	' observed the housemaid . '
101122	101126	101128	101128	Brittles	242	're a woman , '
101135	101140	101142	101143	Mr. Giles	241	' Brittles is right , '
101151	101197	101146	101146	his	241	' from a woman , nothing else was to be expected . We , being men , took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle 's hob , and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark , - as it might be so . '
101250	101256	101258	101259	Mr. Giles	241	' It was a knock , '
101265	101272	101258	101259	Mr. Giles	241	' Open the door , somebody . '
101276	101297	101299	101300	Mr. Giles	241	' It seems a strange sort of a thing , a knock coming at such a time in the morning , '
101316	101330	101314	101314	himself	241	' but the door must be opened . Do you hear , somebody ? '
101404	101419	101421	101422	Mr. Giles	241	' If Brittles would rather open the door , in the presence of witnesses , '
101429	101437	101421	101422	Mr. Giles	241	' I am ready to make one . '
101438	101443	101445	101446	the tinker	6852	' So am I , '
101566	101661	101662	101663	A boy	4668	' tails were well pinched , in the hall , to make them bark savagely . These precautions having been taken , Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker 's arm to prevent his running away , as he pleasantly said , and gave the word of command to open the door . Brittles obeyed ; the group , peeping timorously over each other 's shoulders , beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist , speechless and exhausted , who raised his heavy eyes , and mutely solicited their compassion . '
101665	101679	101662	101663	A boy	4668	' exclaimed Mr. Giles , valiantly , pushing the tinker into the background . '
101702	101762	101692	101692	Brittles	242	' Brittles , who had got behind the door to open it , no sooner saw Oliver , than he uttered a loud cry . Mr. Giles , seizing the boy by one leg and one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall , and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof . '
101767	101783	101764	101764	he	4668	' bawled Giles , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase ; '
101816	101817	101811	101811	Brittles	242	' '
101825	101913	101914	101914	Giles	241	' cried Brittles , applying one hand to the side of his mouth , so that his voice might travel the better . The two women - servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber ; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver , lest he should die before he could be hanged . In the midst of all this noise and commotion , there was heard a sweet female voice , which quelled it in an instant . '
101916	101926	101927	101927	I	0	' whispered the voice from the stair - head . '
101928	101933	101935	101936	Mr. Giles	241	'm here , miss , '
101938	101971	101935	101936	Mr. Giles	241	' Do n't be frightened , miss ; I ai n't much injured . He did n't make a very desperate resistance , miss ! I was soon too many for him . '
101972	101975	101977	101979	the young lady	5568	' Hush ! '
101981	102000	101977	101979	the young lady	5568	' you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did . Is the poor creature much hurt ? '
102001	102007	102009	102009	Giles	241	' Wounded desperate , miss , '
102015	102028	102030	102030	Brittles	242	' He looks as if he was a - going , miss , '
102039	102058	102030	102030	Brittles	242	' Would n't you like to come and look at him , miss , in case he should ? '
102059	102070	102072	102073	the lady	679	' Hush , pray ; there 's a good man ! '
102075	102088	102072	102073	the lady	679	' Wait quietly only one instant , while I speak to aunt . '
102163	102178	102180	102181	Mr. Giles	241	' But wo n't you take one look at him , first , miss ? '
102204	102212	102180	102181	Mr. Giles	241	' Not one little peep , miss ? '
102213	102221	102223	102225	the young lady	5568	' Not now , for the world , '
102227	102242	102223	102225	the young lady	5568	' Poor fellow ! Oh ! treat him kindly , Giles for my sake ! '
102805	102819	102821	102823	the old lady	5061	' And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour , has he ? '
102829	102838	102840	102841	Mr. Giles	241	' An hour and twelve minutes , ma'am , '
102858	102864	102866	102868	the old lady	5061	' He is always slow , '
102870	102880	102882	102883	the attendant	2124	' Brittles always was a slow boy , ma'am , '
102918	102929	102931	102933	the elder lady	2512	' He gets worse instead of better , I think , '
102935	102952	102954	102956	the young lady	5568	' It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys , '
103033	103042	103044	103046	the fat gentleman	2524	' I never heard of such a thing ! '
103048	103075	103044	103046	the fat gentleman	2524	' My dear Mrs. Maylie - bless my soul - in the silence of the night , too - I never heard of such a thing ! '
103103	103116	103118	103120	the fat gentleman	2524	' You ought to be dead ; positively dead with the fright , '
103122	103158	103118	103120	the fat gentleman	2524	' Why did n't you send ? Bless me , my man should have come in a minute ; and so would I ; and my assistant would have been delighted ; or anybody , I 'm
103181	103239	103241	103241	you	769	' The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected , and attempted in the night - time ; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon , and to make an appointment , by post , a day or two previous . '
103246	103257	103258	103258	I	0	' said the doctor , turning to the young lady , '

103355	103360	103316	103316	Giles	241	' said the doctor ; '
103408	103458	103459	103459	Gad	246	' Mr. Giles , who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory , answered respectfully , that it was not for the like of him to judge about that ; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party . '
103465	103470	103459	103459	Gad	246	' said the doctor . '
103516	103560	103561	103562	the doctor	5019	' Talking all the way , he followed Mr. Giles upstairs ; and while he is going upstairs , the reader may be informed , that Mr. Losberne , a surgeon in the neighbourhood , known through a circuit of ten miles round as '
103564	103697	103561	103562	the doctor	5019	' had grown fat , more from good - humour than from good living : and was as kind and hearty , and withal as eccentric an old bachelor , as will be found in five times that space , by any explorer alive . The doctor was absent , much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated . A large flat box was fetched out of the gig ; and a bedroom bell was rung very often ; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually ; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above . At length he returned ; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient ; looked very mysterious , and closed the door , carefully . '
103708	103728	103705	103706	Mrs. Maylie	244	' said the doctor , standing with his back to the door , as if to keep it shut . '

103922	103931	103919	103920	Mrs. Maylie	244	' but I would n't hear of it . '
103932	103935	103937	103938	the doctor	5019	' Humph ! '
103940	103961	103937	103938	the doctor	5019	' There is nothing very alarming in his appearance . Have you any objection to see him in my presence ? '

103974	103978	103970	103972	the old lady	5061	' certainly not . '
103979	103987	103989	103990	the doctor	5019	' Then I think it is necessary , '
103992	104046	103989	103990	the doctor	5019	' at all events , I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so , if you postponed it . He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now . Allow me - Miss Rose , will you permit me ? Not the slightest fear , I pledge you my honour ! '

'
104111	104132	104137	104137	you	2544	' said the doctor , in a whisper , as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom - door , '
104175	104475	104165	104165	me	0	' Stepping before them , he looked into the room . Motioning them to advance , he closed the door when they had entered ; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed . Upon it , in lieu of the dogged , black - visaged ruffian they had expected to behold , there lay a mere child : worn with pain and exhaustion , and sunk into a deep sleep . His wounded arm , bound and splintered up , was crossed upon his breast ; his head reclined upon the other arm , which was half hidden by his long hair , as it streamed over the pillow . The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand , and looked on , for a minute or so , in silence . Whilst he was watching the patient thus , the younger lady glided softly past , and seating herself in a chair by the bedside , gathered Oliver 's hair from his face . As she stooped over him , her tears fell upon his forehead . The boy stirred , and smiled in his sleep , as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known . Thus , a strain of gentle music , or the rippling of water in a silent place , or the odour of a flower , or the mention of a familiar word , will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were , in this life ; which vanish like a breath ; which some brief memory of a happier existence , long gone by , would seem to have awakened ; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall . '
104481	104487	104165	104165	me	0	' exclaimed the elder lady . '
104500	104501	104502	104502	Vice	250	' '
104504	104513	104516	104516	her	2546	' said the surgeon , replacing the curtain , '
104535	104536	104527	104529	a fair outside	2550	' '
104544	104548	104527	104529	a fair outside	2550	' urged Rose . '
104554	104564	104527	104529	a fair outside	2550	' rejoined the surgeon , mournfully shaking his head ; '
104591	104592	104580	104583	The youngest and fairest	2553	' '
104620	104660	104601	104601	you	0	' said Rose . The surgeon shook his head , in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible ; and observing that they might disturb the patient , led the way into an adjoining apartment . '
104669	104673	104596	104596	you	0	' pursued Rose , '
104823	104824	104825	104825	My	0	' '
104829	104845	104847	104847	you	5967	' said the elder lady , as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom , '
104858	104859	104847	104847	you	5967	' '
104864	104870	104847	104847	you	5967	' replied Rose , eagerly . '
104875	104881	104847	104847	you	5967	' said the old lady ; '
104914	104915	104906	104906	I	0	' '
104922	104927	104929	104929	me	0	' said the doctor ; '
104932	104970	104929	104929	me	0	' Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets , and took several turns up and down the room ; often stopping , and balancing himself on his toes , and frowning frightfully . After various exclamations of '
104976	104978	104929	104929	me	0	' and '
104985	105009	104981	104981	I	0	' and as many renewals of the walking and frowning , he at length made a dead halt , and spoke as follows : '
105081	105082	105074	105074	You	2570	' '
105094	105099	105102	105103	no other	2575	' replied Mrs. Maylie . '
105105	105110	105102	105103	no other	2575	' said the doctor . '
105120	105121	105102	105103	no other	2575	' '
105131	105140	105102	105103	no other	2575	' said Rose , smiling through her tears ; '
105156	105157	105158	105158	You	0	' '
105163	105168	105158	105158	You	0	' retorted the doctor , '
105260	105261	105262	105262	You	0	' '
105273	105279	105271	105271	himself	242	' returned Rose , blushing . '
105282	105290	105271	105271	himself	242	' said the doctor , laughing heartily , '
105442	105443	105447	105447	aunt	6905	' '
105449	105453	105447	105447	aunt	6905	' entreated Rose . '
105459	105464	105447	105447	aunt	6905	' said the doctor . '
105470	105471	105472	105472	He	4803	' '
105480	105484	105472	105472	He	4803	' said Rose ; '
105489	105490	105472	105472	He	4803	' '
105494	105499	105472	105472	He	4803	' retorted the doctor ; '
105512	106097	106117	106118	Mr. Giles	241	' Finally the treaty was entered into ; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait , with some impatience , until Oliver should awake . The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect ; for hour after hour passed on , and still Oliver slumbered heavily . It was evening , indeed , before the kind - hearted doctor brought them the intelligence , that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to . The boy was very ill , he said , and weak from the loss of blood ; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something , that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity , than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning : which he should otherwise have done . The conference was a long one . Oliver told them all his simple history , and was often compelled to stop , by pain and want of strength . It was a solemn thing , to hear , in the darkened room , the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him . Oh ! if when we oppress and grind our fellow - creatures , we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error , which , like dense and heavy clouds , are rising , slowly it is true , but not less surely , to Heaven , to pour their after - vengeance on our heads ; if we heard but one instant , in imagination , the deep testimony of dead men 's voices , which no power can stifle , and no pride shut out ; where would be the injury and injustice , the suffering , misery , cruelty , and wrong , that each day 's life brings with it ! Oliver 's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night ; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept . He felt calm and happy , and could have died without a murmur . The momentous interview was no sooner concluded , and Oliver composed to rest again , than the doctor , after wiping his eyes , and condemning them for being weak all at once , betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles . And finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen ; so into the kitchen he went . There were assembled , in that lower house of the domestic parliament , the women - servants , Mr. Brittles , Mr. Giles , the tinker who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day , in consideration of his services , and the constable . The latter gentleman had a large staff , a large head , large features , and large half - boots ; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale - as indeed he had . The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion ; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind , when the doctor entered ; Mr. Brittles , with a mug of ale in his hand , was corroborating everything , before his superior said it . '
106101	106110	106117	106118	Mr. Giles	241	' said the doctor , waving his hand . '
106120	106158	106117	106118	Mr. Giles	241	' Misses wished some ale to be given out , sir ; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room , sir , and was disposed for company , I am taking mine among 'em
106161	106217	106117	106118	Mr. Giles	241	' Brittles headed a low murmur , by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles 's condescension . Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air , as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly , he would never desert them . '
106228	106232	106220	106221	the patient	4567	' asked Giles . '
106236	106242	106220	106221	the patient	4567	' ; returned the doctor . '
106258	106259	106255	106256	Mr. Giles	241	' '
106271	106278	106262	106262	you	4564	' said Mr. Giles , trembling , '
106324	106325	106322	106322	sir	4564	' '
106332	106339	106340	106341	Mr. Giles	241	' said the doctor , mysteriously . '
106348	106349	106352	106352	sir	4564	' '
106358	106369	106352	106352	sir	4564	' faltered Mr. Giles , who had turned very pale . '
106377	106387	106392	106392	sir	4564	' said the doctor , turning sharply upon Brittles . '
106394	106401	106402	106402	I	0	' replied Brittles , starting violently ; '
106403	106412	106421	106422	the doctor	5019	'm the same as Mr. Giles , sir . '
106413	106419	106421	106422	the doctor	5019	' Then tell me this , '
106424	106472	106421	106422	the doctor	5019	' both of you , both of you ! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear , that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night ? Out with it ! Come ! We are prepared for you ! '
106525	106537	106539	106540	the doctor	5019	' Pay attention to the reply , constable , will you ? '
106572	106581	106582	106583	The constable	6992	' Something may come of this before long . '
106610	106623	106625	106626	the doctor	5019	' It 's a simple question of identity , you will observe , '
106628	106637	106639	106640	the constable	6992	' That 's what it is , sir , '
106667	106675	106677	106678	the doctor	5019	' Here 's the house broken into , '
106680	106790	106677	106678	the doctor	5019	' and a couple of men catch one moment 's glimpse of a boy , in the midst of gunpowder smoke , and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness . Here 's a boy comes to that very same house , next morning , and because he happens to have his arm tied up , these men lay violent hands upon him - by doing which , they place his life in great danger - and swear he is the thief . Now , the question is , whether these men are justified by the fact ; if not , in what situation do they place themselves ? '
106814	106820	106822	106823	the doctor	5019	' I ask you again , '
106825	106840	106822	106823	the doctor	5019	' are you , on your solemn oaths , able to identify that boy ? '
106906	106912	106914	106914	Brittles	242	' It 's the runners ! '
106922	106926	106928	106929	the doctor	5019	' The what ? '
106936	106944	106946	106946	Brittles	242	' The Bow Street officers , sir , '
106953	106960	106946	106946	Brittles	242	' me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em
106964	106965	106946	106946	Brittles	242	' '
106968	106973	106946	106946	Brittles	242	' cried the doctor . '
106976	106980	106981	106981	I	0	' replied Brittles ; '
107002	107003	107008	107008	you	5019	' '
107023	107037	107012	107012	your	5019	' said the doctor , walking away . CHAPTER XXXI INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION '
107042	107069	107012	107012	your	5019	' inquired Brittles , opening the door a little way , with the chain up , and peeping out , shading the candle with his hand . '
107074	107080	107012	107012	your	5019	' replied a man outside ; '
107097	107149	107083	107087	the officers from Bow Street	2623	' Much comforted by this assurance , Brittles opened the door to its full width , and confronted a portly man in a great - coat ; who walked in , without saying anything more , and wiped his shoes on the mat , as coolly as if he lived there . '
107165	107170	107171	107171	he	2625	' said the officer ; '
107188	107206	107207	107207	Brittles	242	' us here , that you could put it up in , for five or ten minutes ? '
107361	107375	107377	107379	the stouter man	2637	' Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here , will you ? '
107396	107421	107377	107379	the stouter man	2637	' Oh ! Good - evening , master . Can I have a word or two with you in private , if you please ? '
107454	107463	107465	107466	Mr. Losberne	247	' This is the lady of the house , '
107563	107575	107577	107577	Blathers	251	' Now , with regard to this here robbery , master , '
107579	107585	107577	107577	Blathers	251	' What are the circumstances ? '
107622	107640	107642	107642	Blathers	251	' I ca n't say , for certain , till I see the work , of course , '
107644	107677	107642	107642	Blathers	251	' but my opinion at once is , - I do n't mind committing myself to that extent , - that this was n't done by a yokel ; eh , Duff ? '
107678	107682	107684	107684	Duff	252	' Certainly not , '
107686	107717	107719	107720	Mr. Losberne	247	' And , translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies , I apprehend your meaning to be , that this attempt was not made by a countryman ? '
107726	107733	107735	107735	Blathers	251	' That 's it , master , '
107737	107748	107735	107735	Blathers	251	' This is all about the robbery , is it ? '
107749	107752	107754	107755	the doctor	5019	' All , '
107757	107777	107779	107779	Blathers	251	' Now , what is this , about this here boy that the servants are a - talking on ? '
107781	107786	107788	107789	the doctor	5019	' Nothing at all , '
107791	107828	107788	107789	the doctor	5019	' One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head , that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house ; but it 's nonsense : sheer absurdity . '
107829	107839	107841	107841	Duff	252	' Wery easy disposed of , if it is , '
107843	107851	107853	107853	Blathers	251	' What he says is quite correct , '
107879	107913	107856	107856	his	251	' Who is the boy ? What account does he give of himself ? Where did he come from ? He did n't drop out of the clouds , did he , master ? '
107914	107919	107921	107922	the doctor	5019	' Of course not , '
107933	107968	107921	107922	the doctor	5019	' I know his whole history : but we can talk about that presently . You would like , first , to see the place where the thieves made their attempt , I suppose ? '
107969	107972	107974	107975	Mr. Blathers	251	' Certainly , '
107977	108001	107974	107975	Mr. Blathers	251	' We had better inspect the premises first , and examine the servants afterwards . That 's the usual way of doing business . '
108251	108256	108257	108257	he	5019	' Upon my word , '
108273	108281	108257	108257	he	5019	' I hardly know what to do . '
108282	108285	108287	108287	Rose	245	' Surely , '
108289	108309	108287	108287	Rose	245	' the poor child 's story , faithfully repeated to these men , will be sufficient to exonerate him . '
108310	108320	108322	108323	the doctor	5019	' I doubt it , my dear young lady , '
108329	108382	108326	108326	his	5019	' I do n't think it would exonerate him , either with them , or with legal functionaries of a higher grade . What is he , after all , they would say ? A runaway . Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities , his story is a very doubtful one . '
108383	108390	108392	108392	Rose	245	' You believe it , surely ? '
108394	108416	108418	108419	the doctor	5019	' I believe it , strange as it is ; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so , '
108421	108441	108418	108419	the doctor	5019	' but I do n't think it is exactly the tale for a practical police - officer , nevertheless . '
108442	108446	108448	108448	Rose	245	' Why not ? '
108450	108459	108461	108462	the doctor	5019	' Because , my pretty cross - examiner , '
108464	108705	108461	108462	the doctor	5019	' because , viewed with their eyes , there are many ugly points about it ; he can only prove the parts that look ill , and none of those that look well . Confound the fellows , they will have the why and the wherefore , and will take nothing for granted . On his own showing , you see , he has been the companion of thieves for some time past ; he has been carried to a police - officer , on a charge of picking a gentleman 's pocket ; he has been taken away , forcibly , from that gentleman 's house , to a place which he can not describe or point out , and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea . He is brought down to Chertsey , by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him , whether he will or no ; and is put through a window to rob a house ; and then , just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates , and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights , there rushes into the way , a blundering dog of a half - bred butler , and shoots him ! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself ! Do n't you see all this ? '
108706	108714	108716	108716	Rose	245	' I see it , of course , '
108725	108742	108716	108716	Rose	245	' but still I do not see anything in it , to criminate the poor child . '
108743	108746	108748	108749	the doctor	5019	' No , '
108751	108797	108748	108749	the doctor	5019	' of course not ! Bless the bright eyes of your sex ! They never see , whether for good or bad , more than one side of any question ; and that is , always , the one which first presents itself to them . '
108830	108838	108840	108841	the doctor	5019	' The more I think of it , '
108843	108927	108840	108841	the doctor	5019	' the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy 's real story . I am certain it will not be believed ; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end , still the dragging it forward , and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it , must interfere , materially , with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery . '
108928	108937	108939	108939	Rose	245	' Oh ! what is to be done ? '
108941	108954	108939	108939	Rose	245	' Dear , dear ! why did they send for these people ? '
108955	108960	108962	108963	Mrs. Maylie	244	' Why , indeed ! '
108965	108978	108962	108963	Mrs. Maylie	244	' I would not have had them here , for the world . '
108979	108985	108987	108988	Mr. Losberne	247	' All I know is , '
109002	109082	108987	108988	Mr. Losberne	247	' that we must try and carry it off with a bold face . The object is a good one , and that must be our excuse . The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him , and is in no condition to be talked to any more ; that 's one comfort . We must make the best of it ; and if bad be the best , it is no fault of ours . Come in ! '
109083	109088	109090	109090	Blathers	251	' Well , master , '
109112	109121	109107	109107	he	251	' This warn't a put - up thing . '
109122	109134	109136	109137	the doctor	5019	' And what the devil 's a put - up thing ? '
109141	109153	109155	109155	Blathers	251	' We call it a put - up robbery , ladies , '
109177	109185	109163	109163	he	251	' when the servants is in it . '
109186	109195	109197	109198	Mrs. Maylie	244	' Nobody suspected them , in this case , '
109200	109207	109209	109209	Blathers	251	' Wery likely not , ma'am , '
109211	109224	109209	109209	Blathers	251	' but they might have been in it , for all that . '
109225	109233	109235	109235	Duff	252	' More likely on that wery account , '

109340	109353	109355	109356	the doctor	5019	' Perhaps they will take something to drink first , Mrs. Maylie ? '

109385	109396	109381	109381	Rose	245	' You shall have it immediately , if you will . '
109397	109405	109407	109407	Blathers	251	' Why , thank you , miss ! '
109418	109449	109407	109407	Blathers	251	' it 's dry work , this sort of duty . Anythink that 's handy , miss ; do n't put yourself out of the way , on our accounts . '
109450	109456	109458	109459	the doctor	5019	' What shall it be ? '
109469	109485	109487	109487	Blathers	251	' A little drop of spirits , master , if it 's all the same , '
109489	109513	109487	109487	Blathers	251	' It 's a cold ride from London , ma'am ; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . '
109545	109548	109550	109551	Mr. Blathers	251	' Ah ! '
109586	109605	109550	109551	Mr. Blathers	251	' I have seen a good many pieces of business like this , in my time , ladies . '
109606	109619	109621	109622	Mr. Duff	252	' That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton , Blathers , '
109630	109641	109643	109644	Mr. Blathers	251	' That was something in this way , warn't it ? '
109646	109657	109643	109644	Mr. Blathers	251	' that was done by Conkey Chickweed , that was . '
109658	109665	109667	109667	Duff	252	' You always gave that to him '
109669	109693	109667	109667	Duff	252	' It was the Family Pet , I tell you . Conkey had n't any more to do with it than I had . '
109694	109698	109700	109701	Mr. Blathers	251	' Get out ! '
109703	109739	109700	109701	Mr. Blathers	251	' I know better . Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money , though ? What a start that was ! Better than any novel - book I ever see ! '
109740	109745	109747	109747	Rose	245	' What was that ? '
109763	109780	109782	109782	Blathers	251	' It was a robbery , miss , that hardly anybody would have been down upon , '
109784	109790	109782	109782	Blathers	251	' This here Conkey Chickweed - '
109791	109798	109800	109800	Duff	252	' Conkey means Nosey , ma'am , '
109802	109814	109816	109817	Mr. Blathers	251	' Of course the lady knows that , do n't she ? '
109819	109886	109816	109817	Mr. Blathers	251	' Always interrupting , you are , partner ! This here Conkey Chickweed , miss , kept a public - house over Battlebridge way , and he had a cellar , where a good many young lords went to see cock - fighting , and badger - drawing , and that ; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in , for I 've seen 'em
110017	110049	110012	110012	they	2690	'em , found that Conkey had hit the robber ; for there was traces of blood , all the way to some palings a good distance off ; and there they lost 'em
110287	110582	110255	110255	Spyers	255	're sure to have him ; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again . " Spyers no sooner heard this , than he put some clean linen and a comb , in his pocket , in case he should have to stop a day or two ; and away he goes , and sets himself down at one of the public - house windows behind the little red curtain , with his hat on , all ready to bolt out , at a moment 's notice . He was smoking his pipe here , late at night , when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out , " Here he is ! Stop thief ! Murder ! " Jem Spyers dashes out ; and there he sees Chickweed , a - tearing down the street full cry . Away goes Spyers ; on goes Chickweed ; round turns the people ; everybody roars out , " Thieves ! " and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting , all the time , like mad . Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner ; shoots round ; sees a little crowd ; dives in ; " Which is the man ? " " D - me ! " says Chickweed , " I 've lost him again ! " It was a remarkable occurrence , but he warn't to be seen nowhere , so they went back to the public - house . Next morning , Spyers took his old place , and looked out , from behind the curtain , for a tall man with a black patch over his eye , till his own two eyes ached again . At last , he could n't help shutting 'em
110586	110699	110255	110255	Spyers	255	'em a minute ; and the very moment he did so , he hears Chickweed a - roaring out , " Here he is ! " Off he starts once more , with Chickweed half - way down the street ahead of him ; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday 's one , the man 's lost again ! This was done , once or twice more , till one - half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil , who was playing tricks with him arterwards ; and the other half , that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief . '
110700	110707	110709	110710	the doctor	5019	' What did Jem Spyers say ? '
110726	110730	110732	110733	the officer	5322	' Jem Spyers , '
110735	110897	110899	110900	Mr. Blathers	251	' for a long time said nothing at all , and listened to everything without seeming to , which showed he understood his business . But , one morning , he walked into the bar , and taking out his snuffbox , says " Chickweed , I 've found out who done this here robbery . " " Have you ? " said Chickweed . " Oh , my dear Spyers , only let me have wengeance , and I shall die contented ! Oh , my dear Spyers , where is the villain ! " " Come ! " said Spyers , offering him a pinch of snuff , " none of that gammon ! You did it yourself . " So he had ; and a good bit of money he had made by it , too ; and nobody would never have found it out , if he had n't been so precious anxious to keep up appearances ! '
110915	110921	110923	110924	the doctor	5019	' Very curious , indeed , '
110926	110938	110923	110924	the doctor	5019	' Now , if you please , you can walk upstairs . '
110939	110946	110948	110949	Mr. Blathers	251	' If you please , sir , '
111045	111048	111050	111051	Mr. Losberne	247	' This , '

111316	111326	111301	111301	you	2725	' replied Giles , looking vacantly at his questioner . '
111338	111344	111334	111336	Stupid - head	2727	' rejoined Blathers , impatiently . '
111356	111365	111350	111350	I	0	' said Giles , with a rueful countenance . '

111448	111459	111461	111461	Duff	252	' What a precious muddle - headed chap you are ! '
112366	112370	112372	112372	Rose	245	' Poor fellow ! '
112395	112467	112372	112372	Rose	245	' you shall have many opportunities of serving us , if you will . We are going into the country , and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us . The quiet place , the pure air , and all the pleasure and beauties of spring , will restore you in a few days . We will employ you in a hundred ways , when you can bear the trouble . '
112468	112472	112474	112474	Oliver	123	' The trouble ! '
112476	112530	112372	112372	Rose	245	' Oh ! dear lady , if I could but work for you ; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers , or watching your birds , or running up and down the whole day long , to make you happy ; what would I give to do it ! '
112531	112539	112541	112542	Miss Maylie	256	' You shall give nothing at all , '
112546	112589	112541	112542	Miss Maylie	256	' for , as I told you before , we shall employ you in a hundred ways ; and if you only take half the trouble to please us , that you promise now , you will make me very happy indeed . '
112590	112595	112597	112597	Oliver	123	' Happy , ma'am ! '
112599	112608	112597	112597	Oliver	123	' how kind of you to say so ! '

112627	112699	112700	112700	she	5568	' To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us , would be an unspeakable pleasure to me ; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached , in consequence , would delight me , more than you can well imagine . Do you understand me ? '
112709	112717	112719	112719	Oliver	123	' Oh yes , ma'am , yes ! '
112722	112733	112719	112719	Oliver	123	' but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now . '
112734	112738	112740	112742	the young lady	5568	' To whom ? '
112744	112765	112767	112767	Oliver	123	' To the kind gentleman , and the dear old nurse , who took so much care of me before , '
112769	112787	112767	112767	Oliver	123	' If they knew how happy I am , they would be pleased , I am sure . '

112801	112831	112797	112797	Oliver	123	' and Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey , he will carry you to see them . '
112832	112838	112840	112840	Oliver	123	' Has he , ma'am ? '

112946	112960	112935	112936	the doctor	5019	' Do you see anything - hear anything - feel anything - eh ? '
112961	112966	112968	112968	Oliver	123	' That , sir , '
112977	112981	112968	112968	Oliver	123	' That house ! '
112982	112998	113000	113001	the doctor	5019	' Yes ; well , what of it ? Stop coachman . Pull up here , '
113003	113014	113000	113001	the doctor	5019	' What of the house , my man ; eh ? '
113015	113026	113028	113028	Oliver	123	' The thieves - the house they took me to ! '
113030	113036	113038	113039	the doctor	5019	' The devil it is ! '

113094	113097	113099	113105	a little ugly hump - backed man	2775	' Halloa ? '
113133	113140	113099	113105	a little ugly hump - backed man	2775	' What 's the matter here ? '
113141	113144	113099	113105	a little ugly hump - backed man	2775	' Matter ! '
113158	113168	113099	113105	a little ugly hump - backed man	2775	' A good deal . Robbery is the matter . '
113169	113179	113181	113185	the hump - backed man	2778	' There 'll be Murder the matter , too , '
113189	113204	113181	113185	the hump - backed man	2778	' if you do n't take your hands off . Do you hear me ? '
113205	113210	113212	113213	the doctor	5019	' I hear you , '
113222	113249	113212	113213	the doctor	5019	' Where 's - confound the fellow , what 's his rascally name - Sikes ; that 's it . Where 's Sikes , you thief ? '
113350	113353	113355	113359	the hump - backed man	2778	' Now ! '
113367	113399	113355	113359	the hump - backed man	2778	' what do you mean by coming into my house , in this violent way ? Do you want to rob me , or to murder me ? Which is it ? '
113400	113424	113426	113428	the irritable doctor	2787	' Did you ever know a man come out to do either , in a chariot and pair , you ridiculous old vampire ? '
113430	113438	113440	113441	the hunchback	2788	' What do you want , then ? '
113443	113460	113440	113441	the hunchback	2788	' Will you take yourself off , before I do you a mischief ? Curse you ! '
113461	113469	113471	113472	Mr. Losberne	247	' As soon as I think proper , '
113497	113510	113471	113472	Mr. Losberne	247	' I shall find you out , some day , my friend . '
113511	113515	113517	113521	the ill - favoured cripple	2790	' Will you ? '
113523	113531	113517	113521	the ill - favoured cripple	2790	' If you ever want me , I 'm
113570	113598	113564	113564	you	123	' And so saying , the mis - shapen little demon set up a yell , and danced upon the ground , as if wild with rage . '
113604	113611	113564	113564	you	123	' muttered the doctor to himself ; '
113634	113781	113630	113630	yourself	123	' With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money , and returned to the carriage . The man followed to the chariot door , uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way ; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver , he looked into the carriage , and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive , that , waking or sleeping , he could not forget it for months afterwards . He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations , until the driver had resumed his seat ; and when they were once more on their way , they could see him some distance behind : beating his feet upon the ground , and tearing his hair , in transports of real or pretended rage . '
113787	113797	113630	113630	yourself	123	' said the doctor , after a long silence . '
113806	113807	113799	113799	you	0	' '
113812	113813	113799	113799	you	0	' '
113822	113823	113824	113825	An ass	2793	' '
113827	113841	113824	113825	An ass	2793	' said the doctor again , after a further silence of some minutes . '
113941	114154	114157	114157	my	0	' Now , the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life , and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him , that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes , he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him . If the truth must be told , he was a little out of temper , for a minute or two , at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver 's story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any . He soon came round again , however ; and finding that Oliver 's replies to his questions , were still as straightforward and consistent , and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth , as they had ever been , he made up his mind to attach full credence to them , from that time forth . As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided , they were enabled to drive straight thither . When the coach turned into it , his heart beat so violently , that he could scarcely draw his breath . '
114165	114170	114157	114157	my	0	' inquired Mr. Losberne . '
114175	114186	114157	114157	my	0	' replied Oliver , pointing eagerly out of the window . '
114214	114215	114200	114200	I	0	' '
114220	114232	114200	114200	I	0	' said the good doctor , patting him on the shoulder . '
114251	114252	114240	114240	they	2801	' '
114259	114263	114264	114264	They	2801	' cried Oliver . '
114279	114345	114264	114264	They	2801	' The coach rolled on . It stopped . No ; that was the wrong house ; the next door . It went on a few paces , and stopped again . Oliver looked up at the windows , with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face . Alas ! the white house was empty , and there was a bill in the window . '
114349	114350	114264	114264	They	2801	' '
114357	114369	114264	114264	They	2801	' cried Mr. Losberne , taking Oliver 's arm in his . '
114390	114440	114374	114375	Mr. Brownlow	194	' The servant did not know ; but would go and inquire . She presently returned , and said , that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods , and gone to the West Indies , six weeks before . Oliver clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward . '
114447	114458	114461	114461	sir	4564	' inquired Mr. Losberne , after a moment 's pause . '
114462	114468	114461	114461	sir	4564	' ; replied the servant . '
114492	114493	114461	114461	sir	4564	' '
114500	114508	114461	114461	sir	4564	' said Mr. Losberne to the driver ; '
114527	114528	114535	114535	sir	4564	' '
114537	114541	114535	114535	sir	4564	' said Oliver . '
114559	114560	114561	114561	My	0	' '
114573	114578	114561	114561	My	0	' said the doctor . '
114624	116731	116732	116732	Rose	245	' And in obedience to the doctor 's impulse , home they went . This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief , even in the midst of his happiness ; for he had pleased himself , many times during his illness , with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him : and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him , and in bewailing his cruel separation from them . The hope of eventually clearing himself with them , too , and explaining how he had been forced away , had buoyed him up , and sustained him , under many of his recent trials ; and now , the idea that they should have gone so far , and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber - a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day - was almost more than he could bear . The circumstance occasioned no alteration , however , in the behaviour of his benefactors . After another fortnight , when the fine warm weather had fairly begun , and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms , they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey , for some months . Sending the plate , which had so excited Fagin 's cupidity , to the banker 's ; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house , they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country , and took Oliver with them . Who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village ! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain - worn dwellers in close and noisy places , and carry their own freshness , deep into their jaded hearts ! Men who have lived in crowded , pent - up streets , through lives of toil , and who have never wished for change ; men , to whom custom has indeed been second nature , and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks ; even they , with the hand of death upon them , have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature 's face ; and , carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures , have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being . Crawling forth , from day to day , to some green sunny spot , they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky , and hill and plain , and glistening water , that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline , and they have sunk into their tombs , as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before , faded from their dim and feeble sight ! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up , are not of this world , nor of its thoughts and hopes . Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved : may purify our thoughts , and bear down before it old enmity and hatred ; but beneath all this , there lingers , in the least reflective mind , a vague and half - formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before , in some remote and distant time , which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come , and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it . It was a lovely spot to which they repaired . Oliver , whose days had been spent among squalid crowds , and in the midst of noise and brawling , seemed to enter on a new existence there . The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls ; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees ; and the garden - flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours . Hard by , was a little churchyard ; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones , but full of humble mounds , covered with fresh turf and moss : beneath which , the old people of the village lay at rest . Oliver often wandered here ; and , thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay , would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen ; but , when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead , he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground , and would weep for her , sadly , but without pain . It was a happy time . The days were peaceful and serene ; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care ; no languishing in a wretched prison , or associating with wretched men ; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts . Every morning he went to a white - headed old gentleman , who lived near the little church : who taught him to read better , and to write : and who spoke so kindly , and took such pains , that Oliver could never try enough to please him . Then , he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose , and hear them talk of books ; or perhaps sit near them , in some shady place , and listen whilst the young lady read : which he could have done , until it grew too dark to see the letters . Then , he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare ; and at this , he would work hard , in a little room which looked into the garden , till evening came slowly on , when the ladies would walk out again , and he with them : listening with such pleasure to all they said : and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach , or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch : that he could never be quick enough about it . When it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear . There would be no candles lighted at such times as these ; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows , listening to the sweet music , in a perfect rapture . And when Sunday came , how differently the day was spent , from any way in which he had ever spent it yet ! and how happily too ; like all the other days in that most happy time ! There was the little church , in the morning , with the green leaves fluttering at the windows : the birds singing without : and the sweet - smelling air stealing in at the low porch , and filling the homely building with its fragrance . The poor people were so neat and clean , and knelt so reverently in prayer , that it seemed a pleasure , not a tedious duty , their assembling there together ; and though the singing might be rude , it was real , and sounded more musical to Oliver 's ears at least than any he had ever heard in church before . Then , there were the walks as usual , and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men ; and at night , Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible , which he had been studying all the week , and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased , than if he had been the clergyman himself . In the morning , Oliver would be a - foot by six o'clock , roaming the fields , and plundering the hedges , far and wide , for nosegays of wild flowers , with which he would return laden , home ; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange , to the best advantage , for the embellishment of the breakfast - table . There was fresh groundsel , too , for Miss Maylie 's birds , with which Oliver , who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk , would decorate the cages , in the most approved taste . When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day , there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village ; or , failing that , there was rare cricket - playing , sometimes , on the green ; or , failing that , there was always something to do in the garden , or about the plants , to which Oliver who had studied this science also , under the same master , who was a gardener by trade , applied himself with hearty good - will , until Miss Rose made her appearance : when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done . So three months glided away ; three months which , in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals , might have been unmingled happiness , and which , in Oliver 's were true felicity . With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side ; and the truest , warmest , soul - felt gratitude on the other ; it is no wonder that , by the end of that short time , Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece , and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart , was repaid by their pride in , and attachment to , himself . CHAPTER XXXIII WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS , EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by , and summer came . If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness . The great trees , which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months , had now burst into strong life and health ; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground , converted open and naked spots into choice nooks , where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect , steeped in sunshine , which lay stretched beyond . The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green ; and shed her richest perfumes abroad . It was the prime and vigour of the year ; all things were glad and flourishing . Still , the same quiet life went on at the little cottage , and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates . Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy ; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people . He was still the same gentle , attached , affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength , and when he was dependent for every slight attention , and comfort on those who tended him . One beautiful night , when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them : for the day had been unusually warm , and there was a brilliant moon , and a light wind had sprung up , which was unusually refreshing . Rose had been in high spirits , too , and they had walked on , in merry conversation , until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds . Mrs. Maylie being fatigued , they returned more slowly home . The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet , sat down to the piano as usual . After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes , she fell into a low and very solemn air ; and as she played it , they heard a sound as if she were weeping . '
116737	116766	116767	116767	Rose	245	' said the elder lady . Rose made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts . '
116772	116785	116767	116767	Rose	245	' cried Mrs. Maylie , rising hastily , and bending over her . '
116801	116802	116793	116793	My	0	' '
116809	116815	116793	116793	My	0	' replied the young lady . '
116834	116835	116831	116831	I	0	' '
116842	116847	116839	116840	my love	2819	' interposed Mrs. Maylie . '
116857	116876	116877	116877	I	0	' replied Rose : shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke ; '
116889	116953	116954	116955	My child	2823	' Oliver hastened to comply with her request . The young lady , making an effort to recover her cheerfulness , strove to play some livelier tune ; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys . Covering her face with her hands , she sank upon a sofa , and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress . '
116957	116969	116954	116955	My child	2823	' said the elderly lady , folding her arms about her , '
116977	116978	116970	116970	I	0	' '
116990	116994	116979	116979	I	0	' rejoined Rose ; '
117017	117228	117009	117009	I	0	' She was , indeed ; for , when candles were brought , they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home , the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness . Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty ; but it was changed ; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face , which it had never worn before . Another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush : and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye . Again this disappeared , like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud ; and she was once more deadly pale . Oliver , who watched the old lady anxiously , observed that she was alarmed by these appearances ; and so in truth , was he ; but seeing that she affected to make light of them , he endeavoured to do the same , and they so far succeeded , that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night , she was in better spirits ; and appeared even in better health : assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning , quite well . '
117232	117241	117229	117229	I	0	' said Oliver , when Mrs. Maylie returned , '
117259	117299	117248	117248	She	2825	' The old lady motioned to him not to speak ; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room , remained silent for some time . At length , she said , in a trembling voice : '
117342	117343	117335	117335	I	0	' '
117346	117350	117335	117335	I	0	' inquired Oliver . '
117355	117361	117335	117335	I	0	' said the old lady , '
117377	117378	117335	117335	I	0	' '
117384	117390	117335	117335	I	0	' exclaimed Oliver , hastily . '
117398	117408	117395	117396	my child	2823	' said the old lady , wringing her hands . '
117419	117423	117395	117396	my child	2823	' said Oliver . '
117433	117434	117395	117396	my child	2823	' '
117441	117446	117435	117435	She	2825	' rejoined Mrs. Maylies ; '
117471	117518	117466	117466	I	0	' She gave way to such great grief , that Oliver , suppressing his own emotion , ventured to remonstrate with her ; and to beg , earnestly , that , for the sake of the dear young lady herself , she would be more calm . '
117524	117545	117466	117466	I	0	' said Oliver , as the tears forced themselves into his eyes , despite of his efforts to the contrary . '
117619	117620	117647	117647	you	2830	' '
117623	117636	117647	117647	you	2830	' said Mrs. Maylie , laying her hand on Oliver 's head . '
117783	117938	117778	117778	He	167	' Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words , she checked her lamentations as though by one effort ; and drawing herself up as she spoke , became composed and firm . He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted ; and that , under all the care and watching which ensued , Mrs. Maylie was every ready and collected : performing all the duties which had devolved upon her , steadily , and , to all external appearances , even cheerfully . But he was young , and did not know what strong minds are capable of , under trying circumstances . How should he , when their possessors so seldom know themselves ? An anxious night ensued . When morning came , Mrs. Maylie 's predictions were but too well verified . Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever . '
117954	117974	117778	117778	He	167	' said Mrs. Maylie , laying her finger on her lip , as she looked steadily into his face ; '
118055	118072	118052	118052	I	0	' Oliver could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once . '
118078	118087	118052	118052	I	0	' said Mrs. Maylie , pausing to reflect ; '
118121	118122	118116	118116	I	0	' '
118132	118152	118130	118130	ma'am	4974	' inquired Oliver ; impatient to execute his commission , and holding out his trembling hand for the letter . '
118155	118202	118130	118130	ma'am	4974	' replied the old lady , giving it to him mechanically . Oliver glanced at it , and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie , Esquire , at some great lord 's house in the country ; where , he could not make out . '
118209	118218	118219	118219	I	0	' asked Oliver , looking up , impatiently . '
118223	118232	118219	118219	I	0	' replied Mrs. Maylie , taking it back . '
118241	118416	118417	118418	The George	259	' With these words , she gave Oliver her purse , and he started off , without more delay , at the greatest speed he could muster . Swiftly he ran across the fields , and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them : now almost hidden by the high corn on either side , and now emerging on an open field , where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work : nor did he stop once , save now and then , for a few seconds , to recover breath , until he came , in a great heat , and covered with dust , on the little market - place of the market - town . Here he paused , and looked about for the inn . There were a white bank , and a red brewery , and a yellow town - hall ; and in one corner there was a large house , with all the wood about it painted green : before which was the sign of '
118420	118745	118417	118418	The George	259	' To this he hastened , as soon as it caught his eye . He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway ; and who , after hearing what he wanted , referred him to the ostler ; who after hearing all he had to say again , referred him to the landlord ; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth , a white hat , drab breeches , and boots with tops to match , leaning against a pump by the stable - door , picking his teeth with a silver toothpick . This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill : which took a long time making out : and after it was ready , and paid , a horse had to be saddled , and a man to be dressed , which took up ten good minutes more . Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety , that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself , and galloped away , full tear , to the next stage . At length , all was ready ; and the little parcel having been handed up , with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery , the man set spurs to his horse , and rattling over the uneven paving of the market - place , was out of the town , and galloping along the turnpike - road , in a couple of minutes . As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for , and that no time had been lost , Oliver hurried up the inn - yard , with a somewhat lighter heart . He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak , who was at that moment coming out of the inn door . '
118748	118763	118417	118418	The George	259	' cried the man , fixing his eyes on Oliver , and suddenly recoiling . '
118770	118771	118772	118772	I	0	' '
118779	118783	118777	118777	sir	4564	' said Oliver ; '
118802	118803	118804	118804	Death	260	' '
118806	118823	118804	118804	Death	260	' muttered the man to himself , glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes . '
118850	118851	118835	118835	He	2849	' '
118856	118869	118870	118870	I	0	' stammered Oliver , confused by the strange man 's wild look . '
118878	118879	118872	118872	I	0	' '
118883	118898	118881	118881	you	0	' murmured the man , in a horrible passion ; between his clenched teeth ; '
118943	119171	118939	118939	you	0	' The man shook his fist , as he uttered these words incoherently . He advanced towards Oliver , as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him , but fell violently on the ground : writhing and foaming , in a fit . Oliver gazed , for a moment , at the struggles of the madman for such he supposed him to be ; and then darted into the house for help . Having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time : and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted . The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long , however : for when he reached the cottage , there was enough to occupy his mind , and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory . Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse ; before mid - night she was delirious . A medical practitioner , who resided on the spot , was in constant attendance upon her ; and after first seeing the patient , he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside , and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature . '
119175	119179	118939	118939	you	0	' he said , '
119193	119547	118939	118939	you	0	' How often did Oliver start from his bed that night , and stealing out , with noiseless footstep , to the staircase , listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber ! How often did a tremble shake his frame , and cold drops of terror start upon his brow , when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of , had even then occurred ! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered , compared with those he poured forth , now , in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature , who was tottering on the deep grave 's verge ! Oh ! the suspense , the fearful , acute suspense , of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love , is trembling in the balance ! Oh ! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it ; the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate ; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces ; what tortures can equal these ; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them ! Morning came ; and the little cottage was lonely and still . People spoke in whispers ; anxious faces appeared at the gate , from time to time ; women and children went away in tears . All the livelong day , and for hours after it had grown dark , Oliver paced softly up and down the garden , raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber , and shuddering to see the darkened window , looking as if death lay stretched inside . Late that night , Mr. Losberne arrived . '
119552	119564	118939	118939	you	0	' said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke ; '
119579	120226	118939	118939	you	0	' Another morning . The sun shone brightly ; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care ; and , with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her ; with life , and health , and sounds and sights of joy , surrounding her on every side : the fair young creature lay , wasting fast . Oliver crept away to the old churchyard , and sitting down on one of the green mounds , wept and prayed for her , in silence . There was such peace and beauty in the scene ; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape ; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds ; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook , careering overhead ; so much of life and joyousness in all ; that , when the boy raised his aching eyes , and looked about , the thought instinctively occurred to him , that this was not a time for death ; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay ; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter : not for sunlight and fragrance . He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken ; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds . A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts . Another ! Again ! It was tolling for the funeral service . A group of humble mourners entered the gate : wearing white favours ; for the corpse was young . They stood uncovered by a grave ; and there was a mother - a mother once - among the weeping train . But the sun shone brightly , and the birds sang on . Oliver turned homeward , thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady , and wishing that the time could come again , that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was . He had no cause for self - reproach on the score of neglect , or want of thought , for he had been devoted to her service ; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him , on which he fancied he might have been more zealous , and more earnest , and wished he had been . We need be careful how we deal with those about us , when every death carries to some small circle of survivors , thoughts of so much omitted , and so little done - of so many things forgotten , and so many more which might have been repaired ! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing ; if we would be spared its tortures , let us remember this , in time . When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour . Oliver 's heart sank at sight of her ; for she had never left the bedside of her niece ; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away . He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep , from which she would waken , either to recovery and life , or to bid them farewell , and die . They sat , listening , and afraid to speak , for hours . The untasted meal was removed , with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere , they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower , and , at length , cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure . Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep . They both involuntarily darted to the door , as Mr. Losberne entered . '
120231	120237	120229	120229	Rose	261	' cried the old lady . '
120263	120264	120265	120265	You	0	' '
120270	120277	120265	120265	You	0	' said the doctor supporting her . '

120310	120311	120306	120306	She	261	' '
120314	120321	120306	120306	She	261	' cried the doctor , passionately . '
120342	120716	120329	120329	she	261	' The lady fell upon her knees , and tried to fold her hands together ; but the energy which had supported her so long , fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving ; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her . CHAPTER XXXIV CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE ; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER It was almost too much happiness to bear . Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence ; he could not weep , or speak , or rest . He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed , until , after a long ramble in the quiet evening air , a burst of tears came to his relief , and he seemed to awaken , all at once , to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred , and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast . The night was fast closing in , when he returned homeward : laden with flowers which he had culled , with peculiar care , for the adornment of the sick chamber . As he walked briskly along the road , he heard behind him , the noise of some vehicle , approaching at a furious pace . Looking round , he saw that it was a post - chaise , driven at great speed ; and as the horses were galloping , and the road was narrow , he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him . As it dashed on , Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap , whose face seemed familiar to him , although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person . In another second or two , the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise - window , and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop : which he did , as soon as he could pull up his horses . Then , the nightcap once again appeared : and the same voice called Oliver by his name . '
120719	120724	120329	120329	she	261	' cried the voice . '
120742	120743	120735	120740	Master O - li - ver	2855	' '
120750	120803	120746	120746	you	2856	' cried Oliver , running up to the chaise - door . Giles popped out his nightcap again , preparatory to making some reply , when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise , and who eagerly demanded what was the news . '
120808	120813	120746	120746	you	2856	' cried the gentleman , '
120818	120819	120746	120746	you	2856	' '
120825	120831	120746	120746	you	2856	' replied Oliver , hastily . '
120835	120840	120746	120746	you	2856	' exclaimed the gentleman . '
120845	120846	120841	120841	You	123	' '
120851	120855	120849	120849	sir	4564	' replied Oliver . '
120879	120910	120867	120868	Mr. Losberne	247	' The gentleman said not another word , but , opening the chaise - door , leaped out , and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm , led him aside . '
120933	120942	120911	120911	You	123	' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice . '

120969	120973	120960	120960	I	0	' replied Oliver . '
121006	121169	121002	121002	him	247	' The tears stood in Oliver 's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness ; and the gentleman turned his face away , and remained silent , for some minutes . Oliver thought he heard him sob , more than once ; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark - for he could well guess what his feelings were - and so stood apart , feigning to be occupied with his nosegay . All this time , Mr. Giles , with the white nightcap on , had been sitting on the steps of the chaise , supporting an elbow on each knee , and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket - handkerchief dotted with white spots . That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion , was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman , when he turned round and addressed him . '
121187	121191	121172	121172	you	0	' said he . '
121218	121219	121211	121211	You	0	' '
121228	121244	121225	121226	Mr. Harry	263	' said Giles : giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief ; '
121295	121296	121271	121272	the maids	2865	' '
121299	121306	121311	121311	you	0	' rejoined Harry Maylie , smiling , '
121353	121536	121537	121537	Mother	265	' Mr. Giles , reminded of his unbecoming costume , snatched off and pocketed his nightcap ; and substituted a hat , of grave and sober shape , which he took out of the chaise . This done , the postboy drove off ; Giles , Mr. Maylie , and Oliver , followed at their leisure . As they walked along , Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer . He seemed about five - and - twenty years of age , and was of the middle height ; his countenance was frank and handsome ; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing . Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady , that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship , if he had not already spoken of her as his mother . Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage . The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides . '
121539	121545	121537	121537	Mother	265	' whispered the young man ; '

122079	122087	122063	122063	she	2880	' said the young man , impatiently , '

122122	122127	122115	122115	You	461	' replied his mother . '

122388	122394	122395	122395	Mother	265	' was the impatient reply ; '
122466	122467	122468	122468	She	245	' '
122471	122476	122468	122468	She	245	' said Mrs. Maylie . '
122497	122503	122495	122495	mother	461	' said the young man . '
122507	122513	122489	122489	she	245	' rejoined the old lady ; '
122518	122519	122489	122489	she	245	' '
122523	122529	122489	122489	she	245	' urged the young man . '

122690	122691	122687	122687	you	0	' '
122699	122704	122693	122693	I	0	' replied Mrs. Maylie . '

122727	122735	122718	122718	I	0	' said the young man , eagerly . '
122740	122745	122718	122718	I	0	' replied the lady ; '
122751	122752	122753	122753	You	0	' '
122761	122765	122753	122753	You	0	' said Harry . '
122769	122774	122753	122753	You	0	' replied Mrs. Maylie . '
122808	122809	122806	122806	mother	461	' '
122812	122818	122819	122819	I	0	' said the old lady ; '
122825	122947	122819	122819	I	0	' And pressing her son 's hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room . Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding . The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie ; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them . The doctor then communicated , in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend , a precise account of his patient 's situation ; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise , as Oliver 's statement had encouraged him to hope ; and to the whole of which , Mr. Giles , who affected to be busy about the luggage , listened with greedy ears . '
122958	122968	122949	122949	you	2898	' inquired the doctor , when he had concluded . '
122974	122985	122949	122949	you	2898	' replied Mr. Giles , colouring up to the eyes . '
122998	123003	123008	123008	sir	4564	' said the doctor . '
123010	123019	123008	123008	sir	4564	' replied Mr. Giles , with much gravity . '
123022	123027	123028	123028	I	0	' said the doctor , '
123050	123051	123048	123048	Brittles	242	' '
123060	123072	123058	123058	sir	4564	' said Mr. Giles , recovering his usual tone of patronage ; '
123081	123082	123079	123079	sir	4564	' '
123087	123092	123079	123079	sir	4564	' said the doctor . '
123147	123324	123145	123145	you	2898	' Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance , and some wonder , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor , on the termination of which , he made a great many bows , and retired with steps of unusual stateliness . The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour , but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it ; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither , and having called for a mug of ale , announced , with an air of majesty , which was highly effective , that it had pleased his mistress , in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery , to deposit , in the local savings - bank , the sum of five - and - twenty pounds , for his sole use and benefit . At this , the two women - servants lifted up their hands and eyes , and supposed that Mr. Giles , pulling out his shirt - frill , replied , '
123328	124675	123145	123145	you	2898	' ; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors , he would thank them to tell him so . And then he made a great many other remarks , no less illustrative of his humility , which were received with equal favour and applause , and were , withal , as original and as much to the purpose , as the remarks of great men commonly are . Above stairs , the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away ; for the doctor was in high spirits ; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first , he was not proof against the worthy gentleman 's good humour , which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections , and an abundance of small jokes , which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard , and caused him to laugh proportionately ; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor , who laughed immoderately at himself , and made Harry laugh almost as heartily , by the very force of sympathy . So , they were as pleasant a party as , under the circumstances , they could well have been ; and it was late before they retired , with light and thankful hearts , to take that rest of which , after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone , they stood much in need . Oliver rose next morning , in better heart , and went about his usual occupations , with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days . The birds were once more hung out , to sing , in their old places ; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found , were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty . The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang , for days past , over every object , beautiful as all were , was dispelled by magic . The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves ; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music ; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright . Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts , exercise , even over the appearance of external objects . Men who look on nature , and their fellow - men , and cry that all is dark and gloomy , are in the right ; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts . The real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision . It is worthy of remark , and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time , that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone . Harry Maylie , after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home , was seized with such a passion for flowers , and displayed such a taste in their arrangement , as left his young companion far behind . If Oliver were behindhand in these respects , he knew where the best were to be found ; and morning after morning they scoured the country together , and brought home the fairest that blossomed . The window of the young lady 's chamber was opened now ; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in , and revive her with its freshness ; but there always stood in water , just inside the lattice , one particular little bunch , which was made up with great care , every morning . Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away , although the little vase was regularly replenished ; nor , could he help observing , that whenever the doctor came into the garden , he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner , and nodded his head most expressively , as he set forth on his morning 's walk . Pending these observations , the days were flying by ; and Rose was rapidly recovering . Nor did Oliver 's time hang heavy on his hands , although the young lady had not yet left her chamber , and there were no evening walks , save now and then , for a short distance , with Mrs. Maylie . He applied himself , with redoubled assiduity , to the instructions of the white - headed old gentleman , and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself . It was while he was engaged in this pursuit , that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence . The little room in which he was accustomed to sit , when busy at his books , was on the ground - floor , at the back of the house . It was quite a cottage - room , with a lattice - window : around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle , that crept over the casement , and filled the place with their delicious perfume . It looked into a garden , whence a wicket - gate opened into a small paddock ; all beyond , was fine meadow - land and wood . There was no other dwelling near , in that direction ; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive . One beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , Oliver sat at this window , intent upon his books . He had been poring over them for some time ; and , as the day had been uncommonly sultry , and he had exerted himself a great deal , it is no disparagement to the authors , whoever they may have been , to say , that gradually and by slow degrees , he fell asleep . There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes , which , while it holds the body prisoner , does not free the mind from a sense of things about it , and enable it to ramble at its pleasure . So far as an overpowering heaviness , a prostration of strength , and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion , can be called sleep , this is it ; and yet , we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us , and , if we dream at such a time , words which are really spoken , or sounds which really exist at the moment , accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions , until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two . Nor is this , the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state . It is an undoubted fact , that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead , yet our sleeping thoughts , and the visionary scenes that pass before us , will be influenced and materially influenced , by the mere silent presence of some external object ; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes : and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness . Oliver knew , perfectly well , that he was in his own little room ; that his books were lying on the table before him ; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside . And yet he was asleep . Suddenly , the scene changed ; the air became close and confined ; and he thought , with a glow of terror , that he was in the Jew 's house again . There sat the hideous old man , in his accustomed corner , pointing at him , and whispering to another man , with his face averted , who sat beside him . '
124681	124690	124693	124693	he	2908	' he thought he heard the Jew say ; '
124701	124702	124703	124703	He	2908	' '
124705	124713	124720	124720	you	0	' the other man seemed to answer ; '
124791	125008	125023	125027	the inmates of the house	2911	' The man seemed to say this , with such dreadful hatred , that Oliver awoke with the fear , and started up . Good Heaven ! what was that , which sent the blood tingling to his heart , and deprived him of his voice , and of power to move ! There - there - at the window - close before him - so close , that he could have almost touched him before he started back : with his eyes peering into the room , and meeting his : there stood the Jew ! And beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn - yard . It was but an instant , a glance , a flash , before his eyes ; and they were gone . But they had recognised him , and he them ; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory , as if it had been deeply carved in stone , and set before him from his birth . He stood transfixed for a moment ; then , leaping from the window into the garden , called loudly for help . CHAPTER XXXV CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER 'S
125071	125078	125046	125046	him	123	' The Jew ! the Jew ! '
125118	125125	125126	125126	he	241	' What direction did he take ? '
125141	125144	125146	125146	Oliver	123	' That , '
125157	125165	125146	125146	Oliver	123	' I missed them in an instant . '
125166	125175	125177	125177	Harry	131	' Then , they are in the ditch ! '
125179	125192	125177	125177	Harry	131	' Follow ! And keep as near me , as you can . '
125504	125514	125516	125517	Harry Maylie	131	' It must have been a dream , Oliver , '
125519	125527	125529	125529	Oliver	123	' Oh no , indeed , sir , '
125543	125565	125529	125529	Oliver	123	' I saw him too plainly for that . I saw them both , as plainly as I see you now . '
125566	125572	125574	125574	Harry	131	' Who was the other ? '
125581	125601	125603	125603	Oliver	123	' The very same man I told you of , who came so suddenly upon me at the inn , '
125605	125623	125603	125603	Oliver	123	' We had our eyes fixed full upon each other ; and I could swear to him . '
125624	125630	125632	125632	Harry	131	' They took this way ? '
125634	125639	125632	125632	Harry	131	' are you sure ? '
125640	125652	125654	125654	Oliver	123	' As I am that the men were at the window , '
125676	125703	125654	125654	Oliver	123	' The tall man leaped over , just there ; and the Jew , running a few paces to the right , crept through that gap . '
125821	125826	125828	125828	Harry	131	' This is strange ! '
125830	125833	125835	125836	the doctor	5019	' Strange ? '
125838	125851	125835	125836	the doctor	5019	' Blathers and Duff , themselves , could make nothing of it . '
126247	126260	126262	126264	the young man	1803	' A few - a very few - will suffice , Rose , '
126272	126312	126262	126264	the young man	1803	' What I shall have to say , has already presented itself to your mind ; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you , though from my lips you have not heard them stated . '
126358	126371	126373	126373	Harry	131	' I - I - ought to have left here , before , '
126375	126381	126383	126383	Rose	245	' You should , indeed , '
126385	126398	126383	126383	Rose	245	' Forgive me for saying so , but I wish you had . '
126399	126415	126417	126419	the young man	1803	' I was brought here , by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions , '
126421	126504	126417	126419	the young man	1803	' the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed . You had been dying ; trembling between earth and heaven . We know that when the young , the beautiful , and good , are visited with sickness , their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest ; we know , Heaven help us ! that the best and fairest of our kind , too often fade in blooming . '
126569	126573	126575	126577	the young man	1803	' A creature , '
126581	126889	126575	126577	the young man	1803	' a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God 's own angels , fluttered between life and death . Oh ! who could hope , when the distant world to which she was akin , half opened to her view , that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this ! Rose , Rose , to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow , which a light from above , casts upon the earth ; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here ; hardly to know a reason why you should be ; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight ; and yet to pray , amid all these consolations , that you might be restored to those who loved you - these were distractions almost too great to bear . They were mine , by day and night ; and with them , came such a rushing torrent of fears , and apprehensions , and selfish regrets , lest you should die , and never know how devotedly I loved you , as almost bore down sense and reason in its course . You recovered . Day by day , and almost hour by hour , some drop of health came back , and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you , swelled it again to a high and rushing tide . I have watched you change almost from death , to life , with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection . Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this ; for it has softened my heart to all mankind . '
126890	126897	126899	126899	Rose	245	' I did not mean that , '
126903	126931	126899	126899	Rose	245	' I only wish you had left here , that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again ; to pursuits well worthy of you . '
126932	126962	126964	126966	the young man	1803	' There is no pursuit more worthy of me : more worthy of the highest nature that exists : than the struggle to win such a heart as yours , '
126972	127112	126964	126966	the young man	1803	' Rose , my own dear Rose ! For years - for years - I have loved you ; hoping to win my way to fame , and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share ; thinking , in my daydreams , how I would remind you , in that happy moment , of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy 's attachment , and claim your hand , as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us ! That time has not arrived ; but here , with not fame won , and no young vision realised , I offer you the heart so long your own , and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer . '
127113	127123	127125	127125	Rose	245	' Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . '
127136	127153	127125	127125	Rose	245	' As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful , so hear my answer . '
127154	127172	126964	126966	the young man	1803	' It is , that I may endeavour to deserve you ; it is , dear Rose ? '
127173	127177	127179	127179	Rose	245	' It is , '
127181	127261	127179	127179	Rose	245	' that you must endeavour to forget me ; not as your old and dearly - attached companion , for that would wound me deeply ; but , as the object of your love . Look into the world ; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain , are there . Confide some other passion to me , if you will ; I will be the truest , warmest , and most faithful friend you have . '
127294	127301	127302	127302	he	131	' And your reasons , Rose , '
127313	127320	127302	127302	he	131	' your reasons for this decision ? '
127321	127330	127332	127332	Rose	245	' You have a right to know them , '
127334	127365	127302	127302	he	131	' You can say nothing to alter my resolution . It is a duty that I must perform . I owe it , alike to others , and to myself . '
127366	127370	127302	127302	he	131	' To yourself ? '
127371	127463	127302	127302	he	131	' Yes , Harry . I owe it to myself , that I , a friendless , portionless , girl , with a blight upon my name , should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion , and fastened myself , a clog , on all your hopes and projects . I owe it to you and yours , to prevent you from opposing , in the warmth of your generous nature , this great obstacle to your progress in the world . '
127464	127475	127476	127476	Harry	131	' If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty - '
127479	127484	127486	127486	Rose	245	' They do not , '
127491	127498	127500	127500	Harry	131	' Then you return my love ? '
127502	127523	127500	127500	Harry	131	' Say but that , dear Rose ; say but that ; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment ! '
127524	127541	127543	127543	Rose	245	' If I could have done so , without doing heavy wrong to him I loved , '
127545	127550	127543	127543	Rose	245	' I could have - '
127551	127559	127561	127561	Harry	131	' Have received this declaration very differently ? '
127563	127576	127561	127561	Harry	131	' Do not conceal that from me , at least , Rose . '
127577	127581	127583	127583	Rose	245	' I could , '
127585	127588	127589	127589	she	245	' Stay ! '
127596	127726	127589	127589	she	245	' why should we prolong this painful interview ? Most painful to me , and yet productive of lasting happiness , notwithstanding ; for it will be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy , and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness . Farewell , Harry ! As we have met to - day , we meet no more ; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us , we may be long and happily entwined ; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity , cheer and prosper you ! '
127727	127733	127735	127735	Harry	131	' Another word , Rose , '
127737	127755	127735	127735	Harry	131	' Your reason in your own words . From your own lips , let me hear it ! '
127756	127762	127764	127764	Rose	245	' The prospect before you , '
127768	127846	127848	127850	the young lady	5568	' is a brilliant one . All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life , are in store for you . But those connections are proud ; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life ; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother 's place . In a word , '
127862	127899	127856	127856	her	5568	' there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads . I will carry it into no blood but my own ; and the reproach shall rest alone on me . '
127900	127913	127915	127915	Harry	131	' One word more , Rose . Dearest Rose ! one more ! '
127922	127982	127918	127918	himself	131	' If I had been less - less fortunate , the world would call it - if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny - if I had been poor , sick , helpless - would you have turned from me then ? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour , given this scruple birth ? '
127983	127991	127993	127993	Rose	245	' Do not press me to reply , '
127995	128017	127993	127993	Rose	245	' The question does not arise , and never will . It is unfair , almost unkind , to urge it . '
128018	128032	128034	128034	Harry	131	' If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is , '
128036	128124	128034	128034	Harry	131	' it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way , and light the path before me . It is not an idle thing to do so much , by the utterance of a few brief words , for one who loves you beyond all else . Oh , Rose : in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment ; in the name of all I have suffered for you , and all you doom me to undergo ; answer me this one question ! '
128125	128136	128138	128138	Rose	245	' Then , if your lot had been differently cast , '
128140	128223	128138	128138	Rose	245	' if you had been even a little , but not so far , above me ; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement , and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds ; I should have been spared this trial . I have every reason to be happy , very happy , now ; but then , Harry , I own I should have been happier . '
128272	128287	128289	128289	Rose	245	' I can not help this weakness , and it makes my purpose stronger , '
128295	128304	128289	128289	Rose	245	' I must leave you now , indeed . '
128305	128311	128313	128313	Harry	131	' I ask one promise , '
128315	128352	128313	128313	Harry	131	' Once , and only once more , - say within a year , but it may be much sooner , - I may speak to you again on this subject , for the last time . '
128353	128364	128366	128366	Rose	245	' Not to press me to alter my right determination , '
128373	128379	128366	128366	Rose	245	' it will be useless . '
128380	128383	128385	128385	Harry	131	' No , '
128387	128441	128385	128385	Harry	131	' to hear you repeat it , if you will - finally repeat it ! I will lay at your feet , whatever of station of fortune I may possess ; and if you still adhere to your present resolution , will not seek , by word or act , to change it . '
128442	128449	128451	128451	Rose	245	' Then let it be so , '
128453	128475	128476	128476	She	245	' it is but one pang the more , and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better . '
128551	128567	128569	128570	the doctor	5019	' And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning ; eh ? '
128585	128603	128573	128574	Harry Maylie	131	' Why , you are not in the same mind or intention two half - hours together ! '
128604	128617	128619	128619	Harry	131	' You will tell me a different tale one of these days , '
128627	128639	128641	128642	Mr. Losberne	247	' I hope I may have good cause to do so , '
128644	128780	128641	128642	Mr. Losberne	247	' though I confess I do n't think I shall . But yesterday morning you had made up your mind , in a great hurry , to stay here , and to accompany your mother , like a dutiful son , to the sea - side . Before noon , you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go , on your road to London . And at night , you urge me , with great mystery , to start before the ladies are stirring ; the consequence of which is , that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds . Too bad , is n't it , Oliver ? '
128781	128804	128806	128806	Oliver	123	' I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away , sir , '
128808	128815	128817	128818	the doctor	5019	' That 's a fine fellow , '
128820	128857	128817	128818	the doctor	5019	' you shall come and see me when you return . But , to speak seriously , Harry ; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone ? '
128858	128863	128865	128865	Harry	131	' The great nobs , '
128867	128921	128865	128865	Harry	131	' under which designation , I presume , you include my most stately uncle , have not communicated with me at all , since I have been here ; nor , at this time of the year , is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them . '
128922	128925	128927	128928	the doctor	5019	' Well , '
128930	128990	128927	128928	the doctor	5019	' you are a queer fellow . But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas , and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life . There 's something in that . Good training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . '
129026	129031	129020	129020	he	131	' We shall see , '
129070	129073	129075	129076	Harry Maylie	131	' Oliver , '
129083	129092	129075	129076	Harry Maylie	131	' let me speak a word with you . '
129124	129131	129133	129133	Harry	131	' You can write well now ? '
129142	129149	129151	129151	Oliver	123	' I hope so , sir , '
129153	129197	129151	129151	Oliver	123	' I shall not be at home again , perhaps for some time ; I wish you would write to me - say once a fort - night : every alternate Monday : to the General Post Office in London . Will you ? '
129198	129213	129215	129215	Oliver	123	' Oh ! certainly , sir ; I shall be proud to do it , '
129223	129239	129241	129243	the young man	1803	' I should like to know how - how my mother and Miss Maylie are , '
129245	129286	129241	129243	the young man	1803	' and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take , and what you talk about , and whether she - they , I mean - seem happy and quite well . You understand me ? '
129287	129296	129298	129298	Oliver	123	' Oh ! quite , sir , quite , '
129300	129312	129314	129314	Harry	131	' I would rather you did not mention it to them , '
129321	129367	129314	129314	Harry	131	' because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener , and it is a trouble and worry to her . Let it be a secret between you and me ; and mind you tell me everything ! I depend upon you . '
129464	129468	129469	129469	he	131	' Drive on ! '
129472	129494	129469	129469	he	131	' hard , fast , full gallop ! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me , to - day . '
129495	129498	129500	129501	the doctor	5019	' Halloa ! '
129519	129535	129500	129501	the doctor	5019	' something very short of flying will keep pace with me . Do you hear ? '
129672	129681	129682	129682	she	245	' He seems in high spirits and happy , '
129688	129710	129682	129682	she	245	' I feared for a time he might be otherwise . I was mistaken . I am very , very glad . '
130175	130186	130188	130189	Mr. Bumble	130	' And to - morrow two months it was done ! '
130195	130201	130188	130189	Mr. Bumble	130	' It seems a age . '
130239	130244	130246	130247	Mr. Bumble	130	' I sold myself , '
130256	130300	130246	130247	Mr. Bumble	130	' for six teaspoons , a pair of sugar - tongs , and a milk - pot ; with a small quantity of second - hand furniture , and twenty pound in money . I went very reasonable . Cheap , dirt cheap ! '
130301	130304	130310	130311	Mr. Bumble	130	' Cheap ! '
130315	130338	130310	130311	Mr. Bumble	130	' you would have been dear at any price ; and dear enough I paid for you , Lord above knows that ! '
130375	130381	130383	130384	Mr. Bumble	130	' Mrs. Bumble , ma'am ! '
130391	130394	130396	130397	the lady	679	' Well ! '
130399	130408	130410	130411	Mr. Bumble	130	' Have the goodness to look at me , '
130428	130435	130436	130436	she	679	' said Mr. Bumble to himself , '
130464	130601	130633	130633	ma'am	4974	' Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers , who , being lightly fed , are in no very high condition ; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances ; are matters of opinion . The matter of fact , is , that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble 's scowl , but , on the contrary , treated it with great disdain , and even raised a laugh thereat , which sounded as though it were genuine . On hearing this most unexpected sound , Mr. Bumble looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed . He then relapsed into his former state ; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner . '
130613	130618	130603	130603	you	0	' inquired Mrs. Bumble . '
130635	130640	130629	130629	I	0	' rejoined Mr. Bumble ; '
130672	130673	130674	130674	Your	0	' '
130677	130686	130687	130687	I	0	' sneered Mrs. Bumble , with ineffable contempt . '
130694	130699	130687	130687	I	0	' said Mr. Bumble . '
130709	130710	130703	130704	a man	469	' '
130726	130735	130717	130718	a woman	6715	' cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased . '
130741	130746	130717	130718	a woman	6715	' thundered Mr. Bumble . '
130777	130964	130769	130769	I	0	' Mrs. Bumble , seeing at a glance , that the decisive moment had now arrived , and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other , must necessarily be final and conclusive , no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone , than she dropped into a chair , and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard - hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears . But , tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble 's soul ; his heart was waterproof . Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain , his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous , by showers of tears , which , being tokens of weakness , and so far tacit admissions of his own power , pleased and exalted him . He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction , and begged , in an encouraging manner , that she should cry her hardest : the exercise being looked upon , by the faculty , as strongly conducive to health . '
130984	130989	130769	130769	I	0	' said Mr. Bumble . '
130994	131253	130769	130769	I	0	' As he discharged himself of this pleasantry , Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg , and putting it on , rather rakishly , on one side , as a man might , who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner , thrust his hands into his pockets , and sauntered towards the door , with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance . Now , Mrs. Corney that was , had tried the tears , because they were less troublesome than a manual assault ; but , she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding , as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering . The first proof he experienced of the fact , was conveyed in a hollow sound , immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room . This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and dexterity upon it with the other . This done , she created a little variety by scratching his face , and tearing his hair ; and , having , by this time , inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence , she pushed him over a chair , which was luckily well situated for the purpose : and defied him to talk about his prerogative again , if he dared . '
131257	131268	130769	130769	I	0	' said Mrs. Bumble , in a voice of command . '
131285	131314	131277	131277	you	3010	' Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance : wondering much what something desperate might be . Picking up his hat , he looked towards the door . '
131319	131324	131316	131316	you	3010	' demanded Mrs. Bumble . '
131332	131345	131316	131316	you	3010	' rejoined Mr. Bumble , making a quicker motion towards the door . '
131353	131369	131352	131352	I	0	'm going , my dear ! You are so very violent , that really I - '
131644	131647	131649	131650	Mr. Bumble	130	' Hem ! '
131659	131687	131649	131650	Mr. Bumble	130	' These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative . Hallo ! hallo there ! What do you mean by this noise , you hussies ? '
131735	131739	131741	131742	Mr. Bumble	130	' My dear , '
131744	131753	131741	131742	Mr. Bumble	130	' I did n't know you were here . '
131754	131762	131764	131765	Mrs. Bumble	132	' Did n't know I was here ! '
131767	131774	131764	131765	Mrs. Bumble	132	' What do you do here ? '
131775	131794	131796	131797	Mr. Bumble	130	' I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly , my dear , '
131827	131836	131838	131839	Mrs. Bumble	132	' You thought they were talking too much ? '
131841	131849	131838	131839	Mrs. Bumble	132	' What business is it of yours ? '
131850	131856	131858	131859	Mr. Bumble	130	' Why , my dear - '
131862	131870	131872	131873	Mrs. Bumble	132	' What business is it of yours ? '
131877	131884	131872	131873	Mrs. Bumble	132	' It 's very true , you 're

131921	131926	131918	131919	Mr. Bumble	130	' returned his lady . '
131937	131987	131988	131989	Mr. Bumble	130	're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that do n't concern you , making everybody in the house laugh , the moment your back is turned , and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day . Be off ; come ! '
132142	132148	132150	132151	Mr. Bumble	130	' All in two months ! '
132158	132195	132150	132151	Mr. Bumble	130	' Two months ! No more than two months ago , I was not only my own master , but everybody else 's , so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned , and now ! - '
132627	132634	132635	132635	he	1957	' Were you looking for me , '
132638	132647	132635	132635	he	1957	' when you peered in at the window ? '

132698	132713	132694	132694	you	130	' said the stranger ; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth ; '

132747	132754	132744	132745	young man	2626	' observed Mr. Bumble , majestically . '
132760	132780	132739	132739	I	0	' said the stranger . Another silence succeeded this short dialogue : which was again broken by the stranger . '
132790	132794	132787	132787	I	0	' said he . '

132853	132862	132845	132846	porochial beadle	3058	' rejoined the other , nodding his head . '

132884	132904	132874	132874	you	130	' rejoined Mr. Bumble , slowly and impressively , to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume . '

132985	133011	133022	133022	he	3065	' replied Mr. Bumble , shading his eyes with his hand , and surveying the stranger , from head to foot , in evident perplexity , '
133060	133088	133147	133147	landlord	3067	' The stranger smiled , and nodded his head again : as much to say , he had not mistaken his man ; then rang the bell . '
133094	133108	133147	133147	landlord	3067	' he said , handing Mr. Bumble 's empty tumbler to the landlord . '
133124	133125	133116	133116	You	130	' '
133130	133140	133116	133116	You	130	' replied Mr. Bumble , with a delicate cough . '
133149	133186	133147	133147	landlord	3067	' said the stranger , drily . The host smiled , disappeared , and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum : of which , the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble 's eyes . '
133192	133204	133190	133190	me	0	' said the stranger , after closing the door and window . '
133290	133359	133366	133366	me	0	' As he spoke , he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion , carefully , as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without . When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins , to see that they were genuine , and had put them up , with much satisfaction , in his waistcoat - pocket , he went on : '
133375	133376	133366	133366	me	0	' '
133383	133388	133366	133366	me	0	' said Mr. Bumble . '

133468	133473	133521	133522	Mr. Bumble	130	'em in the grave ! '
133474	133484	133486	133487	Mr. Bumble	130	' The lying - in room , I suppose ? '
133498	133501	133503	133504	the stranger	1957	' Yes , '
133506	133513	133503	133504	the stranger	1957	' A boy was born there . '
133514	133519	133521	133522	Mr. Bumble	130	' A many boys , '
133530	133538	133540	133541	the stranger	1957	' A murrain on the young devils ! '
133543	133599	133540	133541	the stranger	1957	' I speak of one ; a meek - looking , pale - faced boy , who was apprenticed down here , to a coffin - maker - I wish he had made his coffin , and screwed his body in it - and who afterwards ran away to London , as it was supposed . '
133609	133614	133617	133617	him	123	' said Mr. Bumble ; '
133630	133631	133625	133628	a obstinater young rascal	3080	' '
133649	133672	133642	133642	I	0	' said the stranger , stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver 's vices . '
133690	133691	133688	133688	she	6715	' '
133696	133712	133694	133694	she	6715	' said Mr. Bumble , whom the gin - and - water had rendered facetious . '
133744	133745	133748	133748	you	0	' '
133751	133758	133748	133748	you	0	' demanded the stranger , sternly . '
133765	134039	133760	133760	she	6715	' rejoined Mr. Bumble . The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information , and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards , his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted , and he seemed lost in thought . For some time , he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence ; but at length he breathed more freely ; and withdrawing his eyes , observed that it was no great matter . With that he rose , as if to depart . But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough ; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened , for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half . He well remembered the night of old Sally 's death , which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect , as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney ; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness , he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman 's attendance , as workhouse nurse , upon the young mother of Oliver Twist . Hastily calling this circumstance to mind , he informed the stranger , with an air of mystery , that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died ; and that she could , as he had reason to believe , throw some light on the subject of his inquiry . '
134046	134073	134042	134042	I	0	' said the stranger , thrown off his guard ; and plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused afresh by the intelligence . '
134078	134083	134042	134042	I	0	' rejoined Mr. Bumble . '
134086	134093	134042	134042	I	0	' cried the stranger , hastily . '
134098	134102	134042	134042	I	0	' rejoined Bumble . '
134109	134142	134042	134042	I	0	' said the stranger , producing a scrap of paper , and writing down upon it , an obscure address by the water - side , in characters that betrayed his agitation ; '
134169	134254	134166	134166	your	3087	' With these words , he led the way to the door , after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk . Shortly remarking that their roads were different , he departed , without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night . On glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name . The stranger had not gone far , so he made after him to ask it . '
134260	134277	134257	134257	you	3087	' cried the man , turning quickly round , as Bumble touched him on the arm . '
134281	134282	134257	134257	you	3087	' '
134289	134301	134257	134257	you	3087	' said the other , pointing to the scrap of paper . '
134310	134311	134312	134312	Monks	135	' '
134314	134971	134312	134312	Monks	135	' rejoined the man ; and strode hastily , away . CHAPTER XXXVIII CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR . AND MRS . BUMBLE , AND MR . MONKS , AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull , close , overcast summer evening . The clouds , which had been threatening all day , spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour , already yielded large drops of rain , and seemed to presage a violent thunder - storm , when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble , turning out of the main street of the town , directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses , distant from it some mile and a - half , or thereabouts , and erected on a low unwholesome swamp , bordering upon the river . They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments , which might , perhaps , serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain , and sheltering them from observation . The husband carried a lantern , from which , however , no light yet shone ; and trudged on , a few paces in front , as though - the way being dirty - to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints . They went on , in profound silence ; every now and then , Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace , and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following ; then , discovering that she was close at his heels , he mended his rate of walking , and proceeded , at a considerable increase of speed , towards their place of destination . This was far from being a place of doubtful character ; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians , who , under various pretences of living by their labour , subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime . It was a collection of mere hovels : some , hastily built with loose bricks : others , of old worm - eaten ship - timber : jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement , and planted , for the most part , within a few feet of the river 's bank . A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud , and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it : and here and there an oar or coil of rope : appeared , at first , to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river ; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed , would have led a passer - by , without much difficulty , to the conjecture that they were disposed there , rather for the preservation of appearances , than with any view to their being actually employed . In the heart of this cluster of huts ; and skirting the river , which its upper stories overhung ; stood a large building , formerly used as a manufactory of some kind . It had , in its day , probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements . But it had long since gone to ruin . The rat , the worm , and the action of the damp , had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood ; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water ; while the remainder , tottering and bending over the dark stream , seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion , and involving itself in the same fate . It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused , as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air , and the rain commenced pouring violently down . '
134979	134994	134312	134312	Monks	135	' said Bumble , consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand . '
134998	135033	134312	134312	Monks	135	' cried a voice from above . Following the sound , Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door , breast - high , on the second story . '
135040	135045	134312	134312	Monks	135	' cried the voice ; '
135053	135065	135046	135046	I	0	' With which the head disappeared , and the door closed . '
135071	135086	135068	135069	the man	4928	' asked Mr. Bumble 's good lady . Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative . '
135095	135100	135091	135091	I	0	' said the matron : '
135120	135181	135068	135069	the man	4928	' Mr. Bumble , who had eyed the building with very rueful looks , was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then , when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks : who opened a small door , near which they stood , and beckoned them inwards . '
135185	135197	135068	135069	the man	4928	' he cried impatiently , stamping his foot upon the ground . '
135204	135257	135068	135069	the man	4928	' The woman , who had hesitated at first , walked boldly in , without any other invitation . Mr. Bumble , who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind , followed : obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic . '
135271	135291	135292	135292	We	3091	' said Monks , turning round , and addressing Bumble , after he had bolted the door behind them . '
135300	135309	135294	135294	we	3091	' stammered Bumble , looking apprehensively about him . '
135313	135317	135311	135311	yourselves	3089	' retorted Monks . '
135363	135407	135350	135350	You	3089	' With this agreeable speech , Monks turned short upon the matron , and bent his gaze upon her , till even she , who was not easily cowed , was fain to withdraw her eyes , and turn them towards the ground . '
135416	135420	135410	135411	the woman	2127	' demanded Monks . '
135428	135440	135425	135426	the woman	2127	' replied Mr. Bumble , mindful of his wife 's caution . '
135452	135472	135443	135443	women	5143	' said the matron , interposing , and returning , as she spoke , the searching look of Monks . '
135486	135490	135475	135475	they	5143	' said Monks . '
135497	135502	135506	135506	their	5143	' asked the matron . '
135511	135515	135506	135506	their	5143	' replied Monks . '
135540	135559	135571	135571	she	2062	'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody ; not I ! Do you understand , mistress ? '
135560	135563	135565	135566	the matron	2062	' No , '
135574	135581	135583	135583	Monks	133	' Of course you do n't ! '
135585	135590	135583	135583	Monks	133	' How should you ? '
135682	135686	135687	135687	he	4928	' Hear it ! '
135693	135722	135723	135723	He	4928	' Hear it ! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it . I hate the sound ! '
135760	135771	135773	135773	Monks	133	' These fits come over me , now and then , '
135779	135801	135773	135773	Monks	133	' and thunder sometimes brings them on . Do n't mind me now ; it 's all over for this once . '
135871	135874	135876	135876	Monks	133	' Now , '
135886	135910	135876	135876	Monks	133	' the sooner we come to our business , the better for all . The woman know what it is , does she ? '
135935	135959	135928	135928	she	4864	' He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died ; and that she told you something - '
135960	135970	135972	135973	the matron	2062	' About the mother of the boy you named , '
135977	135980	135972	135973	the matron	2062	' Yes . '
135981	135994	135996	135996	Monks	133	' The first question is , of what nature was her communication ? '
135998	136004	136006	136007	the woman	2127	' That 's the second , '
136012	136024	136006	136007	the woman	2127	' The first is , what may the communication be worth ? '
136025	136041	136043	136043	Monks	133	' Who the devil can tell that , without knowing of what kind it is ? '
136045	136055	136057	136058	Mrs. Bumble	132	' Nobody better than you , I am persuaded , '
136076	136079	136081	136081	Monks	133	' Humph ! '
136092	136104	136081	136081	Monks	133	' there may be money 's worth to get , eh ? '
136105	136110	136146	136147	Mrs. Bumble	132	' Perhaps there may , '
136116	136124	136126	136126	Monks	133	' Something that was taken from her , '
136128	136137	136126	136126	Monks	133	' Something that she wore . Something that - '
136138	136144	136146	136147	Mrs. Bumble	132	' You had better bid , '
136149	136171	136146	136147	Mrs. Bumble	132	' I have heard enough , already , to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to . '
136244	136252	136254	136255	the woman	2127	' What 's it worth to you ? '
136262	136274	136276	136276	Monks	133	' It may be nothing ; it may be twenty pounds , '
136278	136288	136276	136276	Monks	133	' Speak out , and let me know which . '
136289	136311	136313	136314	the woman	2127	' Add five pounds to the sum you have named ; give me five - and - twenty pounds in gold , '
136316	136329	136313	136314	the woman	2127	' and I 'll tell you all I know . Not before . '
136330	136338	136340	136340	Monks	133	' Five - and - twenty pounds ! '
136345	136354	136356	136357	Mrs. Bumble	132	' I spoke as plainly as I could , '
136359	136369	136356	136357	Mrs. Bumble	132	' It 's not a large sum , either . '
136370	136389	136391	136391	Monks	133	' Not a large sum for a paltry secret , that may be nothing when it 's told ! '
136394	136408	136391	136391	Monks	133	' and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more ! '
136409	136430	136432	136433	the matron	2062	' Such matters keep well , and , like good wine , often double their value in course of time , '
136444	136483	136440	136440	she	2062	' As to lying dead , there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come , or twelve million , for anything you or I know , who will tell strange tales at last ! '
136484	136493	136495	136495	Monks	133	' What if I pay it for nothing ? '
136499	136508	136510	136511	the matron	2062	' You can easily take it away again , '
136513	136526	136510	136511	the matron	2062	' I am but a woman ; alone here ; and unprotected . '
136527	136539	136541	136542	Mr. Bumble	130	' Not alone , my dear , nor unprotected , neither , '
136551	136562	136564	136565	Mr. Bumble	130	' I am here , my dear . And besides , '
136574	136656	136571	136571	he	130	' Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons . Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man , my dear , and also that I am a little run to seed , as I may say ; bu he has heerd : I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd , my dear : that I am a very determined officer , with very uncommon strength , if I 'm
136671	136741	136660	136660	I	0	' As Mr. Bumble spoke , he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination ; and plainly showed , by the alarmed expression of every feature , that he did want a little rousing , and not a little , prior to making any very warlike demonstration : unless , indeed , against paupers , or other person or persons trained down for the purpose . '
136747	136755	136744	136745	a fool	454	' said Mrs. Bumble , in reply ; '
136763	136764	136760	136760	your	3120	' '
136787	136793	136778	136778	he	3122	' said Monks , grimly . '
136803	136804	136805	136805	He	3122	' '
136809	136818	136805	136805	He	3122	' tittered the matron , parrying the question . '
136829	136848	136825	136825	you	3120	' rejoined Monks , marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke . '
136877	136884	136885	136885	He	0	'm in earnest . See here ! '
136919	136922	136923	136923	he	0	' Now , '
136926	136962	136923	136923	he	0	' gather them up ; and when this cursed peal of thunder , which I feel is coming up to break over the house - top , is gone , let 's hear your story . '
137078	137091	137092	137093	the matron	2062	' When this woman , that we called old Sally , died , '
137096	137103	137092	137093	the matron	2062	' she and I were alone . '
137104	137111	137113	137113	Monks	133	' Was there no one by ? '
137121	137146	137113	137113	Monks	133	' No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed ? No one who could hear , and might , by possibility , understand ? '
137147	137152	137154	137155	the woman	2127	' Not a soul , '
137157	137174	137154	137155	the woman	2127	' we were alone . I stood alone beside the body when death came over it . '
137175	137178	137180	137180	Monks	133	' Good , '
137186	137190	137180	137180	Monks	133	' Go on . '
137191	137199	137201	137202	the matron	2062	' She spoke of a young creature , '
137204	137237	137201	137202	the matron	2062	' who had brought a child into the world some years before ; not merely in the same room , but in the same bed , in which she then lay dying . '
137238	137241	137243	137243	Monks	133	' Ay ? '
137255	137263	137252	137252	his	133	' Blood ! How things come about ! '
137264	137277	137279	137280	the matron	2062	' The child was the one you named to him last night , '
137288	137296	137279	137280	the matron	2062	' the mother this nurse had robbed . '
137297	137301	137303	137303	Monks	133	' In life ? '
137305	137309	137311	137312	the woman	2127	' In death , '
137320	137357	137311	137312	the woman	2127	' She stole from the corpse , when it had hardly turned to one , that which the dead mother had prayed her , with her last breath , to keep for the infant 's sake . '
137358	137363	137365	137365	Monks	133	' She sold it , '

137389	137405	137407	137408	the matron	2062	' As she told me , with great difficulty , that she had done this , '
137410	137417	137407	137408	the matron	2062	' she fell back and died . '
137418	137423	137425	137425	Monks	133	' Without saying more ? '
137443	137478	137425	137425	Monks	133	' It 's a lie ! I 'll not be played with . She said more . I 'll tear the life out of you both , but I 'll know what it was . '
137479	137487	137489	137490	the woman	2127	' She did n't utter another word , '
137511	137556	137497	137498	Mr. Bumble	130	' but she clutched my gown , violently , with one hand , which was partly closed ; and when I saw that she was dead , and so removed the hand by force , I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper . '
137557	137561	137563	137563	Monks	133	' Which contained - '
137568	137571	137573	137574	the woman	2127	' Nothing , '
137576	137584	137573	137574	the woman	2127	' it was a pawnbroker 's duplicate . '
137585	137589	137591	137591	Monks	133	' For what ? '
137593	137602	137604	137605	the woman	2127	' In good time I 'll tell you . '
137607	137729	137604	137605	the woman	2127	' I judge that she had kept the trinket , for some time , in the hope of turning it to better account ; and then had pawned it ; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker 's interest year by year , and prevent its running out ; so that if anything came of it , it could still be redeemed . Nothing had come of it ; and , as I tell you , she died with the scrap of paper , all worn and tattered , in her hand . The time was out in two days ; I thought something might one day come of it too ; and so redeemed the pledge . '
137730	137736	137738	137738	Monks	133	' Where is it now ? '
137741	137744	137746	137747	the woman	2127	' There , '
137812	137825	137827	137828	the woman	2127	' It has the word " Agnes " engraved on the inside , '
137830	137862	137827	137828	the woman	2127	' There is a blank left for the surname ; and then follows the date ; which is within a year before the child was born . I found out that . '
137863	137869	137871	137871	Monks	133	' And this is all ? '
137887	137890	137892	137893	the woman	2127	' All , '

138026	138037	138018	138018	Monks	133	' but whether I answer or not is another question . '
138038	138044	138046	138047	Mr. Bumble	130	' - Which makes three , '
138055	138066	138068	138069	the matron	2062	' Is that what you expected to get from me ? '
138071	138075	138077	138077	Monks	133	' It is , '
138079	138084	138077	138077	Monks	133	' The other question ? '
138085	138102	138018	138018	Monks	133	' What do you propose to do with it ? Can it be used against me ? '
138103	138106	138108	138108	Monks	133	' Never , '
138110	138136	138141	138141	he	133	' nor against me either . See here ! But do n't move a step forward , or your life is not worth a bulrush . '
138187	138191	138193	138193	Monks	133	' Look down , '
138202	138232	138193	138193	Monks	133	' Do n't fear me . I could have let you down , quietly enough , when you were seated over it , if that had been my game . '
138351	138371	138373	138373	Monks	133	' If you flung a man 's body down there , where would it be to - morrow morning ? '
138386	138399	138401	138401	Bumble	130	' Twelve miles down the river , and cut to pieces besides , '

138514	138561	138497	138497	Monks	133	' If the sea ever gives up its dead , as books say it will , it will keep its gold and silver to itself , and that trash among it . We have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . '
138562	138567	138569	138570	Mr. Bumble	130	' By all means , '
138576	138590	138592	138592	Monks	133	' You 'll keep a quiet tongue in your head , will you ? '
138599	138608	138592	138592	Monks	133	' I am not afraid of your wife . '
138609	138619	138621	138622	Mr. Bumble	130	' You may depend upon me , young man , '
138635	138654	138625	138625	himself	130	' On everybody 's account , young man ; on my own , you know , Mr. Monks . '

139409	139415	139417	139418	Mr. Sikes	129	' As weak as water , '
139429	139447	139417	139418	Mr. Sikes	129	' Here ; lend us a hand , and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow . '
139484	139489	139491	139491	Sikes	129	' Whining are you ? '
139493	139520	139491	139491	Sikes	129	' Come ! Do n't stand snivelling there . If you ca n't do anything better than that , cut off altogether . D'ye hear me ? '
139521	139526	139528	139529	the girl	5742	' I hear you , '
139541	139552	139528	139529	the girl	5742	' What fancy have you got in your head now ? '
139553	139566	139568	139568	Sikes	129	' Oh ! you 've thought better of it , have you ? '
139579	139589	139568	139568	Sikes	129	' All the better for you , you have . '
139590	139612	139614	139615	the girl	5742	' Why , you do n't mean to say , you 'd be hard upon me to - night , Bill , '
139624	139627	139629	139630	Mr. Sikes	161	' No ! '
139632	139636	139629	139630	Mr. Sikes	161	' Why not ? '
139637	139644	139646	139647	the girl	5742	' Such a number of nights , '
139670	139741	139646	139647	the girl	5742	' such a number of nights as I 've been patient with you , nursing and caring for you , as if you had been a child : and this the first that I 've seen you like yourself ; you would n't have served me as you did just now , if you 'd thought of that , would you ? Come , come ; say you would n't . '
139742	139747	139629	139630	Mr. Sikes	161	' Well , then , '
139752	139769	139749	139750	Mr. Sikes	161	' I would n't . Why , damme , now , the girls 's whining again ! '
139770	139775	139777	139778	the girl	5742	' It 's nothing , '
139786	139801	139777	139778	the girl	5742	' Do n't you seem to mind me . It 'll soon be over . '
139802	139808	139810	139811	Mr. Sikes	161	' What 'll be over ? '
139817	139847	139810	139811	Mr. Sikes	161	' What foolery are you up to , now , again ? Get up and bustle about , and do n't come over me with your woman 's nonsense . '
139980	139990	139992	139992	Fagin	174	' What 's the matter here , my dear ? '
139997	140009	140011	140011	Sikes	161	' Lend a hand to the girl , ca n't you ? '
140014	140024	140011	140011	Sikes	161	' Do n't stand chattering and grinning at me ! '
140122	140136	140138	140139	Mr. Dawkins	172	' Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows , Charley , '
140141	140156	140138	140139	Mr. Dawkins	172	' and you slap her hands , Fagin , while Bill undoes the petticuts . '
140242	140253	140254	140254	he	172	' Why , what evil wind has blowed you here ? '
140258	140319	140254	140254	he	172	' No evil wind at all , my dear , for evil winds blow nobody any good ; and I 've brought something good with me , that you 'll be glad to see . Dodger , my dear , open the bundle ; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on , this morning . '
140380	140388	140390	140392	that young gentleman	4842	' Sitch a rabbit pie , Bill , '
140401	140429	140390	140392	that young gentleman	4842	' sitch delicate creeturs , with sitch tender limbs , Bill , that the wery bones melt in your mouth , and there 's no occasion to pick 'em
140535	140600	140659	140659	you	3203	' Uttering this last panegyric , Master Bates produced , from one of his extensive pockets , a full - sized wine - bottle , carefully corked ; while Mr. Dawkins , at the same instant , poured out a wine - glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried : which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment 's hesitation . '
140603	140614	140659	140659	you	3203	' said Fagin , rubbing his hands with great satisfaction . '
140626	140627	140615	140615	You	3203	' '
140630	140635	140615	140615	You	3203	' exclaimed Mr. Sikes ; '
140680	140681	140684	140684	him	469	' '
140688	140696	140684	140684	him	469	' said Fagin , shrugging his shoulders . '
140712	140713	140720	140720	their	3208	' '
140723	140738	140720	140720	their	3208	' observed Mr. Sikes : a little soothed as he glanced over the table ; '
140787	140798	140720	140720	their	3208	' ere dog . - Drive him down , Charley ! '
140799	140810	140812	140813	Master Bates	179	' I never see such a jolly dog as that , '
140821	140839	140812	140813	Master Bates	179	' Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market ! He 'd make his fortun '
140853	140854	140812	140813	Master Bates	179	' '
140859	140875	140812	140813	Master Bates	179	' cried Sikes , as the dog retreated under the bed : still growling angrily . '
140892	140893	140878	140878	you	3203	' '
140912	140917	140894	140894	I	0	' replied the Jew . '
140925	140929	140936	140936	you	3203	' demanded Sikes . '
140951	140952	140936	140936	you	3203	' '
140983	140984	140973	140973	I	0	' '
140989	140997	140973	140973	I	0	' growled Sikes , with excessive disgust . '
141032	141033	141011	141011	you	3203	' '
141044	141050	141051	141051	I	0	' urged Fagin , submissively . '
141062	141063	141051	141051	I	0	' '
141074	141083	141084	141084	You	161	' replied Sikes , with a bitter grin . '
141158	141159	141163	141163	Bill	161	' '
141165	141175	141163	141163	Bill	161	' remonstrated Fagin , eagerly catching at the word . '
141203	141204	141205	141205	He	174	' '
141211	141219	141205	141205	He	174	' said Nancy , coming hastily forward . '
141228	141333	141205	141205	He	174	' Nancy 's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation ; for the boys , receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew , began to ply her with liquor : of which , however , she took very sparingly ; while Fagin , assuming an unusual flow of spirits , gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper , by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter ; and , moreover , by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes , which , after repeated applications to the spirit - bottle , he condescended to make . '
141340	141345	141205	141205	He	174	' said Mr. Sikes ; '
141358	141359	141347	141347	I	0	' '
141370	141375	141360	141360	I	0	' replied the Jew . '
141384	141388	141390	141390	I	0	' retorted Sikes ; '
141397	141398	141390	141390	I	0	' '
141401	141410	141411	141411	I	0	' cried Fagin , holding up is hands . '
141419	141420	141421	141421	I	0	' '
141452	141456	141432	141432	I	0	' said Sikes ; '
141471	141472	141486	141486	I	0	' '
141477	141485	141486	141486	I	0	' said Fagin , with a sigh , '
141494	141495	141489	141490	the Artful	5843	' '
141505	141510	141496	141496	You	161	' rejoined Mr. Sikes . '
141583	141805	141570	141570	I	0	' After a great deal of haggling and squabbling , Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence : protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen - pence to keep house with ; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he could n't get any more he must accompany him home ; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard . The Jew then , taking leave of his affectionate friend , returned homeward , attended by Nancy and the boys : Mr. Sikes , meanwhile , flinging himself on the bed , and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady 's return . In due course , they arrived at Fagin 's abode , where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage , which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost , and with it , his fifteenth and last sixpence : much to the amusement of his young friends . Mr. Crackit , apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments , yawned , and inquiring after Sikes , took up his hat to go . '
141812	141816	141807	141807	nobody	354	' asked Fagin . '
141822	141832	141807	141807	nobody	354	' answered Mr. Crackit , pulling up his collar ; '
141862	141889	141859	141859	Damme	231	'm as flat as a juryman ; and should have gone to sleep , as fast as Newgate , if I had n't had the good natur '
141899	141905	141898	141898	I	0	'm blessed if I an't ! '
142022	142032	142034	142035	Master Bates	179	' Wot a rum chap you are , Tom ! '
142043	142050	142052	142053	Mr. Chitling	208	' Not a bit of it , '
142055	142061	142052	142053	Mr. Chitling	208	' Am I , Fagin ? '
142062	142071	142073	142073	Fagin	174	' A very clever fellow , my dear , '
142088	142102	142104	142104	Tom	207	' And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell ; an't he , Fagin ? '
142106	142117	142104	142104	Tom	207	' No doubt at all of that , my dear . '
142118	142135	142137	142137	Tom	207	' And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance ; an't it , Fagin ? '
142139	142150	142137	142137	Tom	207	' Very much so , indeed , my dear . They 're

142169	142175	142157	142157	he	174	' cried Tom , triumphantly , '
142207	142208	142205	142205	Fagin	174	' '
142266	142388	142256	142256	It	3232	' In obedience to this hint , the boys , nodding to Nancy , took up their hats , and left the room ; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging , as they went , in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling ; in whose conduct , it is but justice to say , there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar : inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town , who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society : and a great number of fine gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit . '
142391	142402	142256	142256	It	3232	' said Fagin , when they had left the room , '
142482	142505	142506	142506	he	0	'm fond of seeing the young people about me ; and I bear it all , I bear it all . Hush ! '
142517	142524	142506	142506	he	0	' who 's that ? Listen ! '
142660	142663	142664	142664	he	174	' Bah ! '
142674	142714	142664	142664	he	174	' it 's the man I expected before ; he 's coming downstairs . Not a word about the money while he 's here , Nance . He wo n't stop long . Not ten minutes , my dear . '
142778	142786	142788	142788	Fagin	174	' Only one of my young people , '
142801	142808	142809	142810	The girl	5742	' Do n't move , Nancy . '
142882	142886	142888	142888	Fagin	174	' Any news ? '
142890	142893	142888	142888	Fagin	174	' Great . '
142894	142901	142903	142903	Fagin	174	' And - and - good ? '
142920	142927	142929	142929	Monks	133	' Not bad , any way , '
142934	142951	142929	142929	Monks	133	' I have been prompt enough this time . Let me have a word with you . '
143014	143024	143028	143029	the man	4928	' Not that infernal hole we were in before , '
143217	143222	143224	143225	the Jew	1006	' Why , Nance ! '
143236	143242	143230	143230	he	1006	' how pale you are ! '
143243	143246	143248	143249	the girl	5742	' Pale ! '
143266	143278	143248	143249	the girl	5742	' Quite horrible . What have you been doing to yourself ? '
143279	143302	143304	143305	the girl	5742	' Nothing that I know of , except sitting in this close place for I do n't know how long and all , '
143308	143321	143304	143305	the girl	5742	' Come ! Let me get back ; that 's a dear . '
143348	143353	143339	143339	They	3274	' good - night . '
143902	143909	143911	143912	the man	4928	' Why , burn my body ! '
143928	143944	143920	143920	he	4928	' You look like a corpse come to life again . What 's the matter ? '
143945	143948	143950	143951	the girl	5742	' Matter ! '
143953	143966	143950	143951	the girl	5742	' Nothing . What do you look at me so hard for ? '
143967	143973	143975	143975	Sikes	161	' What foolery is this ? '
143988	144004	143975	143975	Sikes	161	' What is it ? What do you mean ? What are you thinking of ? '
144005	144012	144014	144015	the girl	5742	' Of many things , Bill , '
144032	144042	143975	143975	Sikes	161	' But , Lord ! What odds in that ? '
144075	144083	144085	144085	Sikes	161	' I tell you wot it is , '
144087	144100	144085	144085	Sikes	161	' if you have n't caught the fever , and got it comin '
144121	144139	144146	144147	the girl	5742	're not a - going to - . No , damme ! you would n't do that ! '
144140	144144	144146	144147	the girl	5742	' Do what ? '
144149	144154	144156	144156	Sikes	161	' There ai n't , '
144171	144205	144169	144169	himself	161	' there ai n't a stauncher - hearted gal going , or I 'd have cut her throat three months ago . She 's got the fever coming on ; that 's it . '
144269	144272	144274	144275	the robber	1469	' Now , '
144277	144312	144274	144275	the robber	1469	' come and sit aside of me , and put on your own face ; or I 'll alter it so , that you wo n't know it agin when you do want it . '
144438	144447	144449	144450	the girl	5742	' The laudanum has taken effect at last , '
144459	144469	144470	144470	She	5742	' I may be too late , even now . '
144573	144583	144585	144586	the girl	5742	' Has it long gone the half - hour ? '
144588	144598	144600	144601	the man	4928	' It 'll strike the hour in another quarter , '
144610	144625	144627	144627	Nancy	127	' And I can not get there in less than an hour or more , '
144703	144724	144682	144682	She	127	' heads , crossed crowded streets , where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like . '
144730	144932	144725	144726	The woman	2127	' said the people , turning to look after her as she rushed away . When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town , the streets were comparatively deserted ; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past . Some quickened their pace behind , as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate ; and a few made head upon her , and looked back , surprised at her undiminished speed ; but they fell off one by one ; and when she neared her place of destination , she was alone . It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park . As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door , guided her to the spot , the clock struck eleven . She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute , and making up her mind to advance ; but the sound determined her , and she stepped into the hall . The porter 's seat was vacant . She looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs . '
144938	144954	144725	144726	The woman	2127	' said a smartly - dressed female , looking out from a door behind her , '
144961	144962	144725	144726	The woman	2127	' '
144972	144977	144978	144979	A lady	305	' answered the girl . '
144981	144992	144993	144994	What lady	3314	' was the reply , accompanied with a scornful look . '
144996	144997	144993	144994	What lady	3314	' '
145001	145044	144993	144994	What lady	3314	' said Nancy . The young woman , who had by this time , noted her appearance , replied only by a look of virtuous disdain ; and summoned a man to answer her . To him , Nancy repeated her request . '
145052	145057	145048	145048	I	0	' asked the waiter . '
145066	145070	145048	145048	I	0	' replied Nancy . '
145074	145079	145048	145048	I	0	' said the man . '
145086	145091	145048	145048	I	0	' rejoined the girl . '
145098	145099	145095	145096	the lady	679	' '
145102	145113	145095	145096	the lady	679	' said the man , pushing her towards the door . '
145122	145123	145119	145119	yourself	0	' '
145133	145139	145141	145141	I	0	' said the girl violently ; '
145163	145170	145160	145161	anybody here	5826	' she said , looking round , '
145185	145220	145160	145161	anybody here	5826	' This appeal produced an effect on a good - tempered - faced man - cook , who with some of the other servants was looking on , and who stepped forward to interfere . '
145233	145238	145231	145231	you	271	' said this person . '
145244	145249	145231	145231	you	271	' replied the man . '
145266	145319	145254	145256	the young lady	5568	' This allusion to Nancy 's doubtful character , raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids , who remarked , with great fervour , that the creature was a disgrace to her sex ; and strongly advocated her being thrown , ruthlessly , into the kennel . '
145327	145338	145322	145322	you	3316	' said the girl , turning to the men again ; '
145361	145386	145356	145357	God Almighty	167	' The soft - hearted cook added his intercession , and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery . '
145393	145405	145356	145357	God Almighty	167	' said the man , with one foot on the stairs . '
145419	145423	145407	145409	a young woman	339	' said Nancy ; '
145461	145462	145463	145463	I	0	' '
145466	145471	145472	145472	you	339	' said the man , '
145473	145478	145487	145488	the girl	5742	're coming it strong ! '
145479	145485	145487	145488	the girl	5742	' You give the message , '
145491	145499	145487	145488	the girl	5742	' and let me hear the answer . '
145558	145569	145571	145573	the first housemaid	3330	' It 's no good being proper in this world , '
145575	145589	145591	145592	the second	3331	' Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire , '
145600	145606	145594	145595	The third	1287	' what ladies was made of '
145618	145621	145571	145573	the first housemaid	3330	' Shameful ! '
145948	145994	145937	145937	she	127	' It 's a hard matter to get to see you , lady . If I had taken offence , and gone away , as many would have done , you 'd have been sorry for it one day , and not without reason either . '
145995	146009	146011	146011	Rose	245	' I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you , '
146013	146037	146011	146011	Rose	245	' Do not think of that . Tell me why you wished to see me . I am the person you inquired for . '
146076	146083	146084	146084	she	127	' Oh , lady , lady ! '
146095	146117	146084	146084	she	127	' if there was more like you , there would be fewer like me , - there would - there would ! '
146118	146122	146124	146124	Rose	245	' Sit down , '
146128	146156	146124	146124	Rose	245	' If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can , - I shall indeed . Sit down . '
146157	146164	146166	146167	the girl	5742	' Let me stand , lady , '
146172	146200	146166	146167	the girl	5742	' and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better . It is growing late . Is - is - that door shut ? '
146201	146204	146206	146206	Rose	245	' Yes , '
146226	146229	146166	146167	the girl	5742	' Why ? '
146230	146233	146235	146236	the girl	5742	' Because , '
146238	146280	146235	146236	the girl	5742	' I am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands . I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin 's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville . '
146281	146284	146286	146287	Rose Maylie	261	' You ! '
146289	146294	146296	146297	the girl	5742	' I , lady ! '
146299	146401	146296	146297	the girl	5742	' I am the infamous creature you have heard of , that lives among the thieves , and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life , or kinder words than they have given me , so help me God ! Do not mind shrinking openly from me , lady . I am younger than you would think , to look at me , but I am well used to it . The poorest women fall back , as I make my way along the crowded pavement . '
146402	146409	146411	146411	Rose	261	' What dreadful things are these ! '
146420	146430	146432	146433	the girl	5742	' Thank Heaven upon your knees , dear lady , '
146435	146507	146432	146433	the girl	5742	' that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood , and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger , and riot and drunkenness , and - and - something worse than all - as I have been from my cradle . I may use the word , for the alley and the gutter were mine , as they will be my deathbed . '
146508	146513	146515	146515	Rose	261	' I pity you ! '
146522	146531	146515	146515	Rose	261	' It wrings my heart to hear you ! '
146532	146540	146542	146543	the girl	5742	' Heaven bless you for your goodness ! '
146545	146598	146542	146543	the girl	5742	' If you knew what I am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed . But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me , if they knew I had been here , to tell you what I have overheard . Do you know a man named Monks ? '
146599	146602	146604	146604	Rose	261	' No , '
146606	146611	146613	146614	the girl	5742	' He knows you , '
146616	146638	146613	146614	the girl	5742	' and knew you were here , for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out . '
146639	146646	146648	146648	Rose	261	' I never heard the name , '
146650	146660	146662	146663	the girl	5742	' Then he goes by some other amongst us , '
146665	146734	146662	146663	the girl	5742	' which I more than thought before . Some time ago , and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery , I - suspecting this man - listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark . I found out , from what I heard , that Monks - the man I asked you about , you know - '
146735	146738	146740	146740	Rose	261	' Yes , '
146742	146746	146740	146740	Rose	261	' I understand . '
146747	146752	146754	146755	the girl	5742	' - That Monks , '
146757	146842	146754	146755	the girl	5742	' had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him , and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for , though I could n't make out why . A bargain was struck with Fagin , that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum ; and he was to have more for making him a thief , which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own . '
146843	146848	146850	146850	Rose	261	' For what purpose ? '
146852	146873	146875	146876	the girl	5742	' He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened , in the hope of finding out , '
146878	146915	146875	146876	the girl	5742	' and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery . But I did ; and I saw him no more till last night . '
146916	146922	146740	146740	Rose	261	' And what occurred then ? '
146923	147113	146875	146876	the girl	5742	' I 'll tell you , lady . Last night he came again . Again they went upstairs , and I , wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me , again listened at the door . The first words I heard Monks say were these : " So the only proofs of the boy 's identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . " They laughed , and talked of his success in doing this ; and Monks , talking on about the boy , and getting very wild , said that though he had got the young devil 's money safely now , he 'd rather have had it the other way ; for , what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father 's will , by driving him through every jail in town , and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage , after having made a good profit of him besides . '
147114	147120	147122	147122	Rose	261	' What is all this ! '
147124	147137	147139	147140	the girl	5742	' The truth , lady , though it comes from my lips , '
147142	147257	147139	147140	the girl	5742	' Then , he said , with oaths common enough in my ears , but strange to yours , that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy 's life without bringing his own neck in danger , he would ; but , as he could n't , he 'd be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life ; and if he took advantage of his birth and history , he might harm him yet . " In short , Fagin , " he says , " Jew as you are , you never laid such snares as I 'll contrive for my young brother , Oliver . " '
147258	147262	147264	147264	Rose	261	' His brother ! '
147266	147272	147274	147274	Nancy	127	' Those were his words , '
147303	147383	147298	147298	Sikes	161	' And more . When he spoke of you and the other lady , and said it seemed contrived by Heaven , or the devil , against him , that Oliver should come into your hands , he laughed , and said there was some comfort in that too , for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give , if you had them , to know who your two - legged spaniel was . '
147384	147390	147392	147392	Rose	261	' You do not mean , '
147398	147409	147392	147392	Rose	261	' to tell me that this was said in earnest ? '
147410	147425	147427	147428	the girl	5742	' He spoke in hard and angry earnest , if a man ever did , '
147434	147501	147298	147298	Sikes	161	' He is an earnest man when his hatred is up . I know many who do worse things ; but I 'd rather listen to them all a dozen times , than to that Monks once . It is growing late , and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this . I must get back quickly . '
147502	147509	147511	147511	Rose	261	' But what can I do ? '
147513	147578	147511	147511	Rose	261	' To what use can I turn this communication without you ? Back ! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors ? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room , you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour 's delay . '
147579	147586	147588	147589	the girl	5742	' I wish to go back , '
147591	147655	147588	147589	the girl	5742	' I must go back , because - how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you ? - because among the men I have told you of , there is one : the most desperate among them all ; that I ca n't leave : no , not even to be saved from the life I am leading now . '
147656	147668	147670	147670	Rose	261	' Your having interfered in this dear boy 's behalf before , '
147672	147728	147730	147732	the earnest girl	3363	' your coming here , at so great a risk , to tell me what you have heard ; your manner , which convinces me of the truth of what you say ; your evident contrition , and sense of shame ; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed . Oh ! '
147745	147801	147730	147732	the earnest girl	3363	' do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex ; the first - the first , I do believe , who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion . Do hear my words , and let me save you yet , for better things . '
147802	147805	147807	147808	the girl	5742	' Lady , '
147815	147870	147730	147732	the earnest girl	3363	' dear , sweet , angel lady , you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these , and if I had heard them years ago , they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow ; but it is too late , it is too late ! '
147871	147878	147880	147880	Rose	261	' It is never too late , '
147882	147888	147880	147880	Rose	261	' for penitence and atonement . '
147889	147893	147895	147896	the girl	5742	' It is , '
147905	147920	147895	147896	the girl	5742	' I can not leave him now ! I could not be his death . '
147921	147927	147730	147732	the earnest girl	3363	' Why should you be ? '
147931	147937	147939	147940	the girl	5742	' Nothing could save him , '
147942	147978	147939	147940	the girl	5742	' If I told others what I have told you , and led to their being taken , he would be sure to die . He is the boldest , and has been so cruel ! '
147979	147984	147986	147986	Rose	261	' Is it possible , '
147988	148015	147986	147986	Rose	261	' that for such a man as this , you can resign every future hope , and the certainty of immediate rescue ? It is madness . '
148016	148025	148027	148028	the girl	5742	' I do n't know what it is , '
148030	148116	148027	148028	the girl	5742	' I only know that it is so , and not with me alone , but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself . I must go back . Whether it is God 's wrath for the wrong I have done , I do not know ; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage ; and I should be , I believe , if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last . '
148117	148124	148126	148126	Rose	261	' What am I to do ? '
148128	148139	148126	148126	Rose	261	' I should not let you depart from me thus . '
148140	148152	148154	148155	the girl	5742	' You should , lady , and I know you will , '
148159	148187	148154	148155	the girl	5742	' You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness , and forced no promise from you , as I might have done . '
148188	148202	148204	148204	Rose	261	' Of what use , then , is the communication you have made ? '
148206	148231	148204	148204	Rose	261	' This mystery must be investigated , or how will its disclosure to me , benefit Oliver , whom you are anxious to serve ? '
148232	148256	148258	148259	the girl	5742	' You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret , and advise you what to do , '
148261	148274	148276	148276	Rose	261	' But where can I find you again when it is necessary ? '
148278	148307	148276	148276	Rose	261	' I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live , but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time ? '
148308	148346	148348	148349	the girl	5742	' Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept , and come alone , or with the only other person that knows it ; and that I shall not be watched or followed ? '
148351	148357	148359	148359	Rose	261	' I promise you solemnly , '
148361	148374	148376	148377	the girl	5742	' Every Sunday night , from eleven until the clock strikes twelve , '
148381	148393	148376	148377	the girl	5742	' I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive . '
148394	148399	148401	148401	Rose	261	' Stay another moment , '
148412	148526	148401	148401	Rose	261	' Think once again on your own condition , and the opportunity you have of escaping from it . You have a claim on me : not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence , but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption . Will you return to this gang of robbers , and to this man , when a word can save you ? What fascination is it that can take you back , and make you cling to wickedness and misery ? Oh ! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch ! Is there nothing left , to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation ! '
148527	148542	148544	148545	the girl	5742	' When ladies as young , and good , and beautiful as you are , '
148548	148683	148544	148545	the girl	5742	' give away your hearts , love will carry you all lengths - even such as you , who have home , friends , other admirers , everything , to fill them . When such as I , who have no certain roof but the coffinlid , and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse , set our rotten hearts on any man , and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives , who can hope to cure us ? Pity us , lady - pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left , and for having that turned , by a heavy judgment , from a comfort and a pride , into a new means of violence and suffering . '
148684	148688	148690	148690	Rose	261	' You will , '
148696	148720	148690	148690	Rose	261	' take some money from me , which may enable you to live without dishonesty - at all events until we meet again ? '
148721	148726	148728	148729	the girl	5742	' Not a penny , '
148735	148749	148751	148751	Rose	261	' Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you , '
148757	148765	148751	148751	Rose	261	' I wish to serve you indeed . '
148766	148775	148777	148778	the girl	5742	' You would serve me best , lady , '
148784	148857	148777	148778	the girl	5742	' if you could take my life at once ; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am , to - night , than I ever did before , and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived . God bless you , sweet lady , and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine ! '
149371	149379	149380	149380	she	261	' If it be painful to him , '
149383	149442	149380	149380	she	261	' to come back here , how painful it will be to me ! But perhaps he will not come ; he may write , or he may come himself , and studiously abstain from meeting me - he did when he went away . I hardly thought he would ; but it was better for us both . '
149545	149553	149555	149555	Rose	261	' What makes you look so flurried ? '
149562	149577	149579	149580	the boy	437	' I hardly know how ; I feel as if I should be choked , '
149582	149611	149579	149580	the boy	437	' Oh dear ! To think that I should see him at last , and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth ! '
149612	149625	149627	149627	Rose	261	' I never thought you had told us anything but the truth , '
149632	149645	149627	149627	Rose	261	' But what is this ? - of whom do you speak ? '
149646	149653	149655	149655	Oliver	123	' I have seen the gentleman , '
149662	149683	149655	149655	Oliver	123	' the gentleman who was so good to me - Mr. Brownlow , that we have so often talked about . '
149684	149687	149689	149689	Rose	261	' Where ? '
149691	149698	149700	149700	Oliver	123	' Getting out of a coach , '
149707	149772	149774	149774	Oliver	123	' and going into a house . I did n't speak to him - I could n't speak to him , for he did n't see me , and I trembled so , that I was not able to go up to him . But Giles asked , for me , whether he lived there , and they said he did . Look here , '
149782	149794	149774	149774	Oliver	123	' here it is ; here 's where he lives - I 'm
149823	149868	149819	149819	him	123	' With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy , Rose read the address , which was Craven Street , in the Strand . She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account . '
149871	149875	149819	149819	him	123	' she said . '
149932	150086	150111	150111	your	3399	' Oliver needed no prompting to despatch , and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street . When they arrived there , Rose left Oliver in the coach , under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him ; and sending up her card by the servant , requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business . The servant soon returned , to beg that she would walk upstairs ; and following him into an upper room , Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance , in a bottle - green coat . At no great distance from whom , was seated another old gentleman , in nankeen breeches and gaiters ; who did not look particularly benevolent , and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick , and his chin propped thereupon . '
150090	150108	150111	150111	your	3399	' said the gentleman , in the bottle - green coat , hastily rising with great politeness , '
150138	150139	150140	150141	Mr. Brownlow	194	' '
150148	150164	150146	150146	sir	4564	' said Rose , glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken . '
150170	150176	150146	150146	sir	4564	' said the old gentleman . '
150196	150197	150188	150188	you	194	' '
150201	150206	150188	150188	you	194	' interposed Miss Maylie , '
150248	150284	150285	150285	I	0	' Mr. Brownlow inclined his head . Mr. Grimwig , who had made one very stiff bow , and risen from his chair , made another very stiff bow , and dropped into it again . '
150297	150304	150285	150285	I	0	' said Rose , naturally embarrassed ; '
150337	150338	150326	150326	you	194	' '
150341	150346	150347	150348	Oliver Twist	123	' said Mr. Brownlow . '
150354	150519	150349	150349	you	194	' replied Rose . The words no sooner escaped her lips , than Mr. Grimwig , who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table , upset it with a great crash , and falling back in his chair , discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder , and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare ; then , as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion , he jerked himself , as it were , by a convulsion into his former attitude , and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle , which seemed , at last , not to be discharged on empty air , but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach . Mr. Browlow was no less surprised , although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner . He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie 's , and said , '
150594	150595	150596	150598	A bad one	3412	' '
150613	150632	150600	150600	I	0	' growled Mr. Grimwig , speaking by some ventriloquial power , without moving a muscle of his face . '
150646	150652	150635	150644	a child of a noble nature and a warm heart	3413	' said Rose , colouring ; '
150690	150691	150692	150692	I	0	' '
150693	150699	150701	150702	Mr. Grimwig	3414	'm only sixty - one , '
150710	150740	150701	150702	Mr. Grimwig	3414	' And , as the devil 's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least , I do n't see the application of that remark . '
150741	150751	150753	150754	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Do not heed my friend , Miss Maylie , '
150756	150765	150753	150754	Mr. Brownlow	194	' he does not mean what he says . '
150766	150772	150774	150775	Mr. Grimwig	3415	' Yes , he does , '
150777	150784	150786	150787	Mr. Brownlow	194	' No , he does not , '
150797	150809	150811	150812	Mr. Grimwig	3416	' He 'll eat his head , if he does n't , '
150814	150828	150830	150831	Mr. Brownlow	194	' He would deserve to have it knocked off , if he does , '
150833	150848	150850	150851	Mr. Grimwig	3417	' And he 'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , '
150884	150890	150892	150893	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Now , Miss Maylie , '
150895	150978	150979	150979	Rose	261	' to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested . Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child : allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him , and that since I have been absent from this country , my first impression that he had imposed upon me , and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me , has been considerably shaken . '
151053	151057	151059	151061	the old gentleman	4702	' Thank God ! '
151063	151105	151059	151061	the old gentleman	4702	' This is great happiness to me , great happiness . But you have not told me where he is now , Miss Maylie . You must pardon my finding fault with you , - but why not have brought him ? '
151106	151117	151119	151119	Rose	261	' He is waiting in a coach at the door , '
151121	151126	151128	151130	the old gentleman	4702	' At this door ! '
151248	151251	151252	151252	he	3429	' Hush ! '
151268	151275	151252	151252	he	3429	' Do n't be afraid . I 'm
151284	151297	151302	151302	he	3429	're a sweet girl . I like you . Here they are ! '
151360	151375	151377	151378	Mr. Brownlow	194	' There is somebody else who should not be forgotten , by the bye , '
151384	151394	151377	151378	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Send Mrs. Bedwin here , if you please . '
151417	151428	151430	151431	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Why , you get blinder every day , Bedwin , '
151436	151445	151447	151449	the old lady	5061	' Well , that I do , sir , '
151451	151470	151447	151449	the old lady	5061	' People 's eyes , at my time of life , do n't improve with age , sir . '
151471	151479	151481	151482	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I could have told you that , '
151484	151508	151481	151482	Mr. Brownlow	194	' but put on your glasses , and see if you ca n't find out what you were wanted for , will you ? '
151547	151554	151556	151558	the old lady	5061	' God be good to me ! '
151563	151570	151556	151558	the old lady	5061	' it is my innocent boy ! '
151571	151577	151579	151579	Oliver	123	' My dear old nurse ! '
151581	151592	151594	151596	the old lady	5061	' He would come back - I knew he would , '
151604	151694	151594	151596	the old lady	5061	' How well he looks , and how like a gentleman 's son he is dressed again ! Where have you been , this long , long while ? Ah ! the same sweet face , but not so pale ; the same soft eye , but not so sad . I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile , but have seen them every day , side by side with those of my own dear children , dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature . '
152024	152034	152036	152038	the impetuous doctor	3448	' Then what the devil is to be done ? '
152048	152098	152036	152038	the impetuous doctor	3448	' Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds , male and female , and beg them to accept a hundred pounds , or so , apiece , as a trifling mark of our esteem , and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver ? '
152099	152104	152106	152107	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Not exactly that , '
152111	152122	152106	152107	Mr. Brownlow	194	' but we must proceed gently and with great care . '
152123	152128	152130	152131	the doctor	5019	' Gentleness and care , '
152133	152143	152130	152131	the doctor	5019	' I 'd send them one and all to - '
152144	152149	152151	152152	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Never mind where , '
152154	152172	152151	152152	Mr. Brownlow	194	' But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view . '
152173	152177	152179	152180	the doctor	5019	' What object ? '
152182	152213	152179	152180	the doctor	5019	' Simply , the discovery of Oliver 's parentage , and regaining for him the inheritance of which , if this story be true , he has been fraudulently deprived . '
152214	152217	152219	152220	Mr. Losberne	247	' Ah ! '
152230	152236	152225	152225	his	247	' I almost forgot that . '
152237	152241	152243	152244	Mr. Brownlow	194	' You see , '
152246	152280	152243	152244	Mr. Brownlow	194	' placing this poor girl entirely out of the question , and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety , what good should we bring about ? '
152281	152294	152296	152297	the doctor	5019	' Hanging a few of them at least , in all probability , '
152299	152305	152296	152297	the doctor	5019	' and transporting the rest . '
152306	152310	152312	152313	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Very good , '
152317	152378	152312	152313	Mr. Brownlow	194	' but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time , and if we step in to forestall them , it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act , in direct opposition to our own interest - or at least to Oliver 's , which is the same thing . '
152379	152382	152384	152385	the doctor	5019	' How ? '
152387	152545	152384	152385	the doctor	5019	' Thus . It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery , unless we can bring this man , Monks , upon his knees . That can only be done by stratagem , and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people . For , suppose he were apprehended , we have no proof against him . He is not even so far as we know , or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies . If he were not discharged , it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond ; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well , for our purposes , be deaf , dumb , blind , and an idiot . '
152546	152549	152551	152552	the doctor	5019	' Then , '
152555	152592	152551	152552	the doctor	5019	' I put it to you again , whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding ; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions , but really - '
152593	152607	152609	152610	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Do not discuss the point , my dear young lady , pray , '
152621	152772	152609	152610	Mr. Brownlow	194	' The promise shall be kept . I do n't think it will , in the slightest degree , interfere with our proceedings . But , before we can resolve upon any precise course of action , it will be necessary to see the girl ; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks , on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us , and not by the law ; or , if she will not , or can not do that , to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person , as will enable us to identify him . She can not be seen until next Sunday night ; this is Tuesday . I would suggest that in the meantime , we remain perfectly quiet , and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself . '
152828	152833	152834	152834	he	194	' I should like , '
152837	152914	152834	152834	he	194	' to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig . He is a strange creature , but a shrewd one , and might prove of material assistance to us ; I should say that he was bred a lawyer , and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course , in twenty years , though whether that is recommendation or not , you must determine for yourselves . '
152915	152933	152935	152936	the doctor	5019	' I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine , '
152938	152947	152949	152950	Mr. Brownlow	194	' We must put it to the vote , '
152952	152958	152949	152950	Mr. Brownlow	194	' who may he be ? '
152959	152975	152977	152978	the doctor	5019	' That lady 's son , and this young lady 's - very old friend , '
153031	153040	153042	153043	Mrs. Maylie	244	' We stay in town , of course , '
153045	153109	153042	153043	Mrs. Maylie	244	' while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success . I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested , and I am content to remain here , if it be for twelve months , so long as you assure me that any hope remains . '
153110	153113	153115	153116	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Good ! '
153118	153271	153115	153116	Mr. Brownlow	194	' And as I see on the faces about me , a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver 's tale , and had so suddenly left the kingdom , let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story . Believe me , I make this request with good reason , for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised , and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough . Come ! Supper has been announced , and young Oliver , who is all alone in the next room , will have begun to think , by this time , that we have wearied of his company , and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world . '
153322	153657	153295	153296	Mr. Losberne	247	'S , EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS , BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS Upon the night when Nancy , having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep , hurried on her self - imposed mission to Rose Maylie , there advanced towards London , by the Great North Road , two persons , upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention . They were a man and woman ; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female : for the former was one of those long - limbed , knock - kneed , shambling , bony people , to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age , - looking as they do , when they are yet boys , like undergrown men , and when they are almost men , like overgrown boys . The woman was young , but of a robust and hardy make , as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back . Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage , as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder , a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief , and apparently light enough . This circumstance , added to the length of his legs , which were of unusual extent , enabled him with much ease to keep some half - dozen paces in advance of his companion , to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head : as if reproaching her tardiness , and urging her to greater exertion . Thus , they had toiled along the dusty road , taking little heed of any object within sight , save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail - coaches which were whirling out of town , until they passed through Highgate archway ; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion , '
153673	153674	153671	153671	Charlotte	158	' '
153686	153699	153681	153681	I	0	' said the female , coming up , almost breathless with fatigue . '

154235	154247	154249	154249	Charlotte	158	' I know I ai n't as cunning as you are , '
154251	154283	154249	154249	Charlotte	158	' but do n't put all the blame on me , and say I should have been locked up . You would have been if I had been , any way . '

154727	154757	154710	154710	Noah	134	' and do n't yer speak , except when yer spoke to . What 's the name of the house - t - h - r - three what ? '
154758	154761	154763	154763	Charlotte	158	' Cripples , '

154773	154795	154771	154771	Noah	134	' and a very good sign too . Now , then ! Keep close at my heels , and come along . '
154928	154935	154937	154937	Noah	134	' Is this the Three Cripples ? '

154949	154954	154937	154937	Noah	134	' replied the Jew . '
154973	155004	155005	155005	We	3503	' said Noah , nudging Charlotte , perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect , and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise . '
155014	155015	155005	155005	We	3503	' '
155022	155032	155005	155005	We	3503	' said Barney , who was the attendant sprite ; '

155065	155292	155063	155063	yer	3503	' said Noah . Barney complied by ushering them into a small back - room , and setting the required viands before them ; having done which , he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night , and left the amiable couple to their refreshment . Now , this back - room was immediately behind the bar , and some steps lower , so that any person connected with the house , undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last - named apartment , about five feet from its flooring , could not only look down upon any guests in the back - room without any great hazard of being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall , between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself , but could , by applying his ear to the partition , ascertain with tolerable distinctness , their subject of conversation . The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes , and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related , when Fagin , in the course of his evening 's business , came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils . '
155295	155299	155063	155063	yer	3503	' said Barney : '

155347	155416	155344	155344	I'b	3510	' Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest . Mounting a stool , he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass , from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish , and porter from the pot , and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte , who sat patiently by , eating and drinking at his pleasure . '
155419	155428	155429	155429	I	0	' he whispered , looking round to Barney , '

155527	155554	155520	155520	I	0	' said Mr. Claypole , kicking out his legs , and continuing a conversation , the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear . '

155831	155896	155802	155802	Noah	134	'em about , unbeknown to themselves . That would suit me , if there was good profit ; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort , I say it would be cheap at that twenty - pound note you 've got , - especially as we do n't very well know how to get rid of it ourselves . '
156005	156020	156022	156022	Fagin	174	' A pleasant night , sir , but cool for the time of year , '
156028	156038	156022	156022	Fagin	174	' From the country , I see , sir ? '
156039	156046	156048	156049	Noah Claypole	134	' How do yer see that ? '
156051	156063	156065	156065	Fagin	174	' We have not so much dust as that in London , '

156135	156142	156128	156128	his	1006	' and that 's the truth . '
156223	156228	156230	156231	Mr. Claypole	134	' Good stuff that , '

156244	156284	156242	156242	Fagin	174	' A man need be always emptying a till , or a pocket , or a woman 's reticule , or a house , or a mail - coach , or a bank , if he drinks it regularly . '
156321	156330	156332	156332	Fagin	174	' Do n't mind me , my dear , '
156339	156366	156332	156332	Fagin	174	' Ha ! ha ! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance . It was very lucky it was only me . '

156496	156500	156470	156470	you	5742	' rejoined Fagin ; '
156584	156628	156629	156629	I	0	' Noah Claypole 's mind might have been at ease after this assurance , but his body certainly was not ; for he shuffled and writhed about , into various uncouth positions : eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion . '

156847	156869	156845	156845	she	3542	' he asked as he resumed his seat : in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal . '
156873	156883	156884	156884	You	5742	' rejoined Fagin , clapping him on the shoulder . '
156885	156892	156911	156911	Noah	134	're a genius , my dear . '
156893	156909	156911	156911	Noah	134	' Why , I suppose if I was n't , I should n't be here , '
156913	156928	156911	156911	Noah	134	' But , I say , she 'll be back if yer lose time . '
156929	156937	156939	156939	Fagin	174	' Now , what do you think ? '
156941	156958	156939	156939	Fagin	174	' If you was to like my friend , could you do better than join him ? '
156959	156975	156977	156977	Noah	134	' Is he in a good way of business ; that 's where it is ! '
156986	157008	156982	156982	his	134	' The top of the tree ; employs a power of hands ; has the very best society in the profession . '

157066	157076	157060	157060	I	0	' said Noah , slapping his breeches - pocket . '
157085	157095	157060	157060	I	0	' replied Fagin , in a most decided manner . '

157246	157336	157339	157339	yer	3549	' replied Mr. Fagin . Whether Noah Claypole , whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive , would have acceded even to these glowing terms , had he been a perfectly free agent , is very doubtful ; but as he recollected that , in the event of his refusal , it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely things had come to pass , he gradually relented , and said he thought that would suit him .

157342	157346	157348	157348	she	341	' observed Noah , '

157647	157659	157660	157662	The kinchin lay	3556	' said Fagin , laying his hand on Noah 's knee . '

157670	157675	157676	157677	The kinchins	3557	' demanded Mr. Claypole . '

157890	157905	157945	157946	Mr. Bolter	279	' said Noah , when he had recovered himself , and Charlotte had returned . '

157921	157933	157912	157912	we	3562	' asked Fagin , adding , as Mr. Claypole nodded assent , '

157948	157960	157945	157946	Mr. Bolter	279	' replied Noah , who had prepared himself for such emergency . '

158090	158180	158066	158066	I	0	' With many adieus and good wishes , Mr. Fagin went his way . Noah Claypole , bespeaking his good lady 's attention , proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made , with all that haughtiness and air of superiority , becoming , not only a member of the sterner sex , but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay , in London and its vicinity .

158314	158358	158312	158312	Fagin	174	' When a man 's his own enemy , it 's only because he 's too much his own friend ; not because he 's careful for everybody but himself . Pooh ! pooh ! There ai n't such a thing in nature . '
158359	158369	158371	158372	Mr. Bolter	279	' There oughn't to be , if there is , '
158374	158411	158371	158372	Mr. Bolter	279	' That stands to reason . Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number , and some say number seven . It 's neither , my friend , neither . It 's number one . '

158997	159134	158992	158995	a cunning old codger	3585	' Mr. Fagin saw , with delight , that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment , but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius , which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance . To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful , he followed up the blow by acquainting him , in some detail , with the magnitude and extent of his operations ; blending truth and fiction together , as best served his purpose ; and bringing both to bear , with so much art , that Mr. Bolter 's respect visibly increased , and became tempered , at the same time , with a degree of wholesome fear , which it was highly desirable to awaken .

160029	160065	160069	160069	Charley	179	' Mr. Bolter nodded assent , and Fagin , after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction , stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder . '
160071	160076	160069	160069	Charley	179	' said Fagin soothingly ; '

160149	160157	160127	160127	Charley	179	' said Charley , a little consoled . '

160366	160377	160379	160379	Charley	179	' Ah , to be sure , so he will , '
160385	160393	160395	160396	the Jew	1006	' I think I see him now , '
160405	160410	160412	160413	Charley Bates	179	' So do I , '
160415	160464	160471	160471	he	3618	' Ha ! ha ! ha ! so do I. I see it all afore me , upon my soul I do , Fagin . What a game ! What a regular game ! All the big - wigs trying to look solemn , and Jack Dawkins addressing of 'em
160490	160573	160574	160574	We	3621	' In fact , Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend 's eccentric disposition , that Master Bates , who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim , now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour , and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities .

160834	160848	160832	160832	Fagin	174	' inquired Master Bates , surveying Noah 's lank form with much disgust . '

160880	160885	160872	160872	his	3624	' retorted Mr. Bolter ; '
160908	161568	160900	160900	yer'll	3630	' Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat , that it was some time before Fagin could interpose , and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police - office ; that , inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged , nor any description of his person , had yet been forwarded to the metropolis , it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter ; and that , if he were properly disguised , it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London , inasmuch as it would be , of all places , the very last , to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will . Persuaded , in part , by these representations , but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin , Mr. Bolter at length consented , with a very bad grace , to undertake the expedition . By Fagin 's directions , he immediately substituted for his own attire , a waggoner 's frock , velveteen breeches , and leather leggings : all of which articles the Jew had at hand . He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets ; and a carter 's whip . Thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity ; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw - boned a fellow as need be , Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection . These arrangements completed , he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger , and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street . Having described the precise situation of the office , and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage , and when he got into the side , and pull off his hat as he went into the room , Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone , and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting . Noah Claypole , or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases , punctually followed the directions he had received , which - Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality - were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question , or meeting with any interruption by the way . He found himself jostled among a crowd of people , chiefly women , who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room , at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest , with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall , a box for the witnesses in the middle , and a desk for the magistrates on the right ; the awful locality last named , being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze , and left the vulgar to imagine if they could the full majesty of justice . There were only a couple of women in the dock , who were nodding to their admiring friends , while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table . A jailer stood reclining against the dock - rail , tapping his nose listlessly with a large key , except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers , by proclaiming silence ; or looked sternly up to bid some woman '
161574	161877	160900	160900	yer'll	3630	' when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries , half - smothered in the mother 's shawl , from some meagre infant . The room smelt close and unwholesome ; the walls were dirt - discoloured ; and the ceiling blackened . There was an old smoky bust over the mantel - shelf , and a dusty clock above the dock - the only thing present , that seemed to go on as it ought ; for depravity , or poverty , or an habitual acquaintance with both , had left a taint on all the animate matter , hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it . Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger ; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character 's mother or sister , and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father , nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen . He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women , being committed for trial , went flaunting out ; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit . It was indeed Mr. Dawkins , who , shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual , his left hand in his pocket , and his hat in his right hand , preceded the jailer , with a rolling gait altogether indescribable , and , taking his place in the dock , requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that '

161970	162070	161967	161968	Mr. Dawkins	172	' Now then ! Wot is this here business ? I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this here little affair , and not to keep me while they read the paper , for I 've got an appointment with a genelman in the City , and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters , he 'll go away if I ai n't there to my time , and then pr'aps ther wo n't be an action for damage against them as kep me away .

162160	162170	162155	162158	one of the magistrates	3641	' A pick - pocketing case , your worship . '
162171	162180	162194	162195	the jailer	8159	' Has the boy ever been here before ? '
162181	162192	162194	162195	the jailer	8159	' He ought to have been , a many times , '
162197	162214	162194	162195	the jailer	8159	' He has been pretty well everywhere else . I know him well , your worship . '
162215	162225	162227	162228	the Artful	5843	' Oh ! you know me , do you ? '
162237	162253	162227	162228	the Artful	5843	' Wery good . That 's a case of deformation of character , any way . '
162266	162275	162277	162278	the clerk	789	' Now then , where are the witnesses ? '
162280	162287	162289	162290	the Dodger	5121	' Ah ! that 's right , '
162292	162302	162289	162290	the Dodger	5121	' Where are they ? I should like to see 'em
162304	162489	162289	162290	the Dodger	5121	' This wish was immediately gratified , for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd , and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom , which , being a very old one , he deliberately put back again , after trying it on his own countenance . For this reason , he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him , and the said Dodger , being searched , had upon his person a silver snuff - box , with the owner 's name engraved upon the lid . This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide , and being then and there present , swore that the snuff - box was his , and that he had missed it on the previous day , the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to . He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng , particularly active in making his way about , and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him . '

163986	163992	163984	163984	Sikes	161	' Do you hear me ? '

164110	164148	164104	164104	you	5742	' replied Sikes . With which assurance he rose , locked the door , took the key out , and pulling her bonnet from her head , flung it up to the top of an old press . '
164151	164156	164104	164104	you	5742	' said the robber . '
164167	164168	164165	164165	you	5742	' '
164182	164190	164165	164165	you	5742	' said the girl turning very pale . '

164256	164278	164247	164247	You	161	' muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast , as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak . '
164293	164294	164284	164284	you	5742	' '
164297	164301	164284	164284	you	5742	' said Sikes . '
164327	164337	164323	164323	you	5742	' cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground . '
164341	164353	164339	164339	you	5742	' repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her . '
164399	164400	164402	164402	me	0	' '
164405	164428	164402	164402	me	0	' said the girl with great earnestness ; then sitting herself down on the floor , before the door , she said , '
164459	164460	164444	164444	You	161	' '
164469	164480	164444	164444	You	161	' cried Sikes , seizing her roughly by the arm , '
164496	164497	164500	164500	you	161	' '
164516	164635	164507	164507	you	161	' screamed the girl . Sikes looked on , for a minute , watching his opportunity , and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her , struggling and wrestling with him by the way , into a small room adjoining , where he sat himself on a bench , and thrusting her into a chair , held her down by force . She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck , and then , wearied and exhausted , ceased to contest the point any further . With a caution , backed by many oaths , to make no more efforts to go out that night , Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin . '
164638	164649	164507	164507	you	161	' said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face . '
164658	164659	164660	164660	You	161	' '
164667	164672	164673	164673	You	161	' replied Fagin thoughtfully . '
164678	164679	164673	164673	You	161	' '
164700	164704	164682	164682	she	3694	' asked Sikes . '

164743	164747	164728	164728	I	0	' growled Sikes . '
164763	164764	164756	164756	she	3694	' '
164767	164772	164756	164756	she	3694	' said Fagin thoughtfully . '

164791	164795	164789	164789	I	0	' said Sikes . '

164848	164863	164841	164841	she	3694	' said Sikes . Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment . '
164899	164903	164885	164885	you	0	' said Sikes . '
164944	164945	164939	164939	her	3694	' '
164953	164961	164939	164939	her	3694	' replied the Jew in a whisper . '
164964	165010	165014	165014	she	3694	' As he uttered these words , the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat . Her eyes were swollen and red ; she rocked herself to and fro ; tossed her head ; and , after a little time , burst out laughing . '
165021	165110	165014	165014	she	3694	' exclaimed Sikes , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion . Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then ; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour . Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing , Fagin took up his hat and bade him good - night . He paused when he reached the room - door , and looking round , asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs . '
165115	165125	165014	165014	she	3694	' said Sikes , who was filling his pipe . '
165149	165188	165014	165014	she	3694	' Nancy followed the old man downstairs , with a candle . When they reached the passage , he laid his finger on his lip , and drawing close to the girl , said , in a whisper . '
165197	165198	165193	165193	Nancy	127	' '
165204	165214	165201	165201	you	3703	' replied the girl , in the same tone . '
165221	165225	165201	165201	you	3703	' replied Fagin . '
165228	165242	165253	165253	Nance	127	' - he pointed with his skinny fore - finger up the stairs - '
165265	165266	165263	165263	you	127	' '
165269	165293	165263	165263	you	127	' said the girl , as Fagin paused , with his mouth almost touching her ear , and his eyes looking into hers . '
165387	165388	165379	165379	you	127	' '
165394	165405	165389	165389	I	0	' replied the girl , without manifesting the least emotion . '
165410	165707	165379	165379	you	127	' She shrank back , as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers , but said good - night again , in a steady voice , and , answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence , closed the door between them . Fagin walked towards his home , intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain . He had conceived the idea - not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him , but slowly and by degrees - that Nancy , wearied of the housebreaker 's brutality , had conceived an attachment for some new friend . Her altered manner , her repeated absences from home alone , her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous , and , added to these , her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour , all favoured the supposition , and rendered it , to him at least , almost matter of certainty . The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons . He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy , and must thus Fagin argued be secured without delay . There was another , and a darker object , to be gained . Sikes knew too much , and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less , because the wounds were hidden . The girl must know , well , that if she shook him off , she could never be safe from his fury , and that it would be surely wreaked - to the maiming of limbs , or perhaps the loss of life - on the object of her more recent fancy . '
165713	165717	165379	165379	you	127	' thought Fagin , '
165786	165898	165768	165768	my	0	' These things passed through the mind of Fagin , during the short time he sat alone , in the housebreaker 's room ; and with them uppermost in his thoughts , he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him , of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting . There was no expression of surprise , no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning . The girl clearly comprehended it . Her glance at parting showed that . But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes , and that was one of the chief ends to be attained . '
165901	165910	165768	165768	my	0	' thought Fagin , as he crept homeward , '
165926	165987	165988	165988	I	0	' Such brains are fertile in expedients . If , without extracting a confession from herself , he laid a watch , discovered the object of her altered regard , and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs , could he not secure her compliance ? '
165991	165998	165988	165988	I	0	' said Fagin , almost aloud . '
166039	166163	166164	166164	Bolter	279	' He cast back a dark look , and a threatening motion of the hand , towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain ; and went on his way : busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment , which he wrenched tightly in his grasp , as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers . CHAPTER XLV NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION The old man was up , betimes , next morning , and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate , who after a delay that seemed interminable , at length presented himself , and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast .

166166	166181	166164	166164	Bolter	279	' said Fagin , drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter . '

166541	166582	166583	166583	I	0	' Fagin affected to laugh very heartily ; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out , took a series of large bites , which finished his first hunk of bread and butter , and assisted himself to a second . '

166686	166695	166683	166684	the Jew	1006	' it 's only to dodge a woman . '
166696	166701	166703	166704	Mr. Bolter	279	' An old woman ? '
166706	166711	166713	166713	Fagin	174	' A young one , '
166715	166726	166728	166728	Bolter	279	' I can do that pretty well , I know , '
166730	166754	166728	166728	Bolter	279	' I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school . What am I to dodge her for ? Not to - '
166755	166814	166860	166860	Fagin	174	' Not to do anything , but to tell me where she goes , who she sees , and , if possible , what she says ; to remember the street , if it is a street , or the house , if it is a house ; and to bring me back all the information you can . '
166815	166822	166824	166824	Noah	134	' What 'll yer give me ? '
166842	166858	166860	166860	Fagin	174	' If you do it well , a pound , my dear . One pound , '
166874	166899	166860	166860	Fagin	174	' And that 's what I never gave yet , for any job of work where there was n't valuable consideration to be gained . '
166900	166905	166907	166907	Noah	134	' Who is she ? '

They left the house stealthily , and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets , arrived at length before a public - house , which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept , on the night of his arrival in London . It was past eleven o'clock , and the door was closed . It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle . They entered , without noise ; and the door was closed behind them . Scarcely venturing to whisper , but substituting dumb show for words , Fagin , and the young Jew who had admitted them , pointed out the pane of glass to Noah , and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room .

168907	168913	168923	168924	the gentleman	4618	' This is far enough , '
168926	168964	168923	168924	the gentleman	4618	' I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther . Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far , but you see I am willing to humour you . '
168965	168970	168975	168980	the girl whom he had followed	3823	' To humour me ! '

169223	169231	169269	169269	they	3828	' said the gentleman , soothing her . '
169235	169244	169269	169269	they	3828	' replied the girl in a hoarse voice . '

169309	169314	169298	169298	They	3828	' rejoined the girl . '
169319	169391	169298	169298	They	3828	' There was something so uncommon in her manner , that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words , and the blood chilled within him . He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies . '
169397	169406	169298	169298	They	3828	' said the young lady to her companion . '

169509	169514	169536	169538	these good people	834	' said the gentleman . '
169583	169621	169622	169622	You	3845	' These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady , and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself . The gentleman , shortly afterwards , addressed himself to her . '
169630	169634	169622	169622	You	3845	' he said . '
169640	169644	169635	169635	I	0	' replied Nancy ; '

169752	169757	169746	169746	he	3846	' inquired the gentleman . '

169808	169813	169804	169806	This young lady	5574	' the gentleman began , '

169969	169976	169967	169967	Fagin	174	' cried the girl , recoiling . '
169986	169991	169984	169984	you	0	' said the gentleman . '
170004	170009	169998	169998	I	0	' replied the girl . '

170038	170051	170034	170034	You	0	' said the gentleman , who seemed fully prepared for this answer . '
170054	170059	170034	170034	You	0	' returned the girl . '

170070	170076	170094	170094	she	679	' rejoined the girl firmly , '

170174	170195	170167	170167	they	3859	' said the gentleman , quickly , as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain ; '
170211	170212	170167	170167	they	3859	' '
170221	170222	170223	170223	I	0	' '

170296	170301	170274	170274	they	3861	' pursued the gentleman , '
170335	170336	170338	170338	I	0	' '
170346	170351	170352	170352	You	0	' asked the girl . '

170379	170389	170368	170368	Monks	133	' said the girl , after a short pause . '
170392	170397	170368	170368	Monks	133	' replied the gentleman . '
170415	170416	170417	170417	I	0	' '
170431	170441	170420	170421	a liar	1615	' said the girl after another interval of silence , '
170449	170599	170600	170600	He	3866	' After receiving an assurance from both , that she might safely do so , she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said , to describe , by name and situation , the public - house whence she had been followed that night . From the manner in which she occasionally paused , it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated . When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place , the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation , and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it , she seemed to consider for a few moments , for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection . '
170604	170609	170600	170600	He	3866	' said the girl , '
170746	170779	170743	170743	you	3869	' said the girl , stopping suddenly . The gentleman replied , in a hurried manner , that he was not conscious of having done so , and begged her to proceed . '
170784	170789	170743	170743	you	3869	' said the girl , '
170842	170846	170848	170848	his	3866	' she added . '
170873	170874	170867	170867	his	3866	' '
170886	170891	170867	170867	his	3866	' cried the gentleman . '
170896	170901	170867	170867	his	3866	' said the girl . '
170906	170934	170902	170902	You	3869	' The young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe . '
170940	170948	170937	170937	I	0	' said the gentleman , breaking silence . '
170974	171013	171017	171017	he	3866	' As he expressed himself to this effect , with assumed carelessness , he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy , as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter , '
171019	171020	171017	171017	he	3866	' '
171023	171045	171046	171046	you	3869	' he said , returning : so it seemed by the sound : to the spot where he had stood before , '
171076	171077	171070	171070	I	0	' '
171080	171084	171085	171085	You	3869	' replied Nancy . '
171093	171117	171085	171085	You	3869	' rejoined the gentleman , with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart . '
171124	171125	171122	171122	me	0	' '
171130	171137	171128	171128	sir	4564	' rejoined the girl , weeping . '
171154	171155	171156	171156	You	3869	' '
171163	171168	171158	171158	yourself	3869	' said the gentleman . '
171391	171392	171393	171393	She	3886	' '
171399	171405	171406	171406	She	3886	' cried the young lady . '
171413	171414	171406	171406	She	3886	' '
171422	171427	171415	171415	I	0	' said the gentleman . '
171435	171445	171431	171431	I	0	' replied the girl , after a short struggle . '
171508	171516	171488	171488	you	0	' she said , looking hastily round , '
171529	171530	171524	171524	I	0	' '
171533	171546	171524	171524	I	0	' repeated the young lady , with great stress upon the word . '
171551	171556	171524	171524	I	0	' rejoined the girl . '
171615	171616	171603	171603	you	7810	' '
171621	171630	171603	171603	you	7810	' said the gentleman , with a sigh . '
171653	171654	171642	171642	We	3893	' '
171659	171664	171665	171665	You	7810	' urged the girl . '
171668	171669	171665	171665	You	7810	' '
171672	171678	171665	171665	You	7810	' cried the young lady , '
171690	171691	171665	171665	You	7810	' '
171694	171699	171665	171665	You	7810	' repeated the girl . '
171764	171765	171756	171756	I	0	' '
171773	171781	171756	171756	I	0	' returned the young lady , sobbing . '
171799	171804	171756	171756	I	0	' replied the girl . '
171813	171819	171756	171756	I	0	' The gentleman turned away . '
171823	171829	171756	171756	I	0	' cried the young lady . '
171850	171851	171756	171756	I	0	' '
171854	171859	171756	171756	I	0	' replied the girl . '
171939	172015	172035	172035	her	3902	' The violent agitation of the girl , and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill - usage and violence , seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her , as she requested . The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased . The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge . They stopped at the summit of the stairs . '
172018	172026	172028	172028	she	3902	' cried the young lady , listening . '
172038	172039	172035	172035	her	3902	' '
172045	172054	172035	172035	her	3902	' replied Mr. Brownlow , looking sadly back . '
172068	172652	172055	172055	She	3902	' Rose Maylie lingered , but the old gentleman drew her arm through his , and led her , with gentle force , away . As they disappeared , the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs , and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears . After a time she arose , and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street . The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards , and having ascertained , with many cautious glances round him , that he was again alone , crept slowly from his hiding - place , and returned , stealthily and in the shade of the wall , in the same manner as he had descended . Peeping out , more than once , when he reached the top , to make sure that he was unobserved , Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed , and made for the Jew 's house as fast as his legs would carry him . CHAPTER XLVII FATAL CONSEQUENCES It was nearly two hours before day - break ; that time which in the autumn of the year , may be truly called the dead of night ; when the streets are silent and deserted ; when even sounds appear to slumber , and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream ; it was at this still and silent hour , that Fagin sat watching in his old lair , with face so distorted and pale , and eyes so red and blood - shot , that he looked less like a man , than like some hideous phantom , moist from the grave , and worried by an evil spirit . He sat crouching over a cold hearth , wrapped in an old torn coverlet , with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side . His right hand was raised to his lips , and as , absorbed in thought , he hit his long black nails , he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog 's or rat 's . Stretched upon a mattress on the floor , lay Noah Claypole , fast asleep . Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant , and then brought them back again to the candle ; which with a long - burnt wick drooping almost double , and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table , plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere . Indeed they were . Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme ; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers ; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up ; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes ; the fear of detection , and ruin , and death ; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all ; these were the passionate considerations which , following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl , shot through the brain of Fagin , as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart . He sat without changing his attitude in the least , or appearing to take the smallest heed of time , until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street . '
172656	172667	172055	172055	She	3902	' he muttered , wiping his dry and fevered mouth . '
172671	172725	172055	172055	She	3902	' The bell rang gently as he spoke . He crept upstairs to the door , and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin , who carried a bundle under one arm . Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat , the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes . '
172728	172739	172749	172749	you	3905	' he said , laying the bundle on the table . '
172774	172874	172764	172764	I	0	' Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle , and locking it in the cupboard , sat down again without speaking . But he did not take his eyes off the robber , for an instant , during this action ; and now that they sat over against each other , face to face , he looked fixedly at him , with his lips quivering so violently , and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him , that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair , and surveyed him with a look of real affright . '
172878	172882	172764	172764	I	0	' cried Sikes . '
172893	172927	172928	172928	Damme	231	' Fagin raised his right hand , and shook his trembling forefinger in the air ; but his passion was so great , that the power of speech was for the moment gone . '
172930	172944	172945	172945	He	3908	' said Sikes , feeling in his breast with a look of alarm . '
172957	172958	172950	172950	I	0	' '
172963	172971	172950	172950	I	0	' rejoined Fagin , finding his voice . '
172977	172995	173009	173009	Sikes	161	're not the person , Bill . I 've no - no fault to find with you . '
172996	173007	173009	173009	Sikes	161	' Oh , you have n't , have n't you ? '
173027	173046	173009	173009	Sikes	161	' That 's lucky - for one of us . Which one that is , do n't matter . '
173047	173058	173060	173060	Fagin	174	' I 've got that to tell you , Bill , '
173067	173075	173060	173060	Fagin	174	' will make you worse than me . '
173076	173079	173081	173082	the robber	1469	' Aye ? '
173088	173100	173081	173082	the robber	1469	' Tell away ! Look sharp , or Nance will think I 'm
173103	173104	173081	173082	the robber	1469	' '
173107	173111	173112	173112	She	3910	' cried Fagin . '
173126	173164	173168	173168	you	3905	' Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew 's face , and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there , clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly . '
173170	173174	173168	173168	you	3905	' he said ; '
173217	173218	173208	173208	you	3905	' '
173227	173249	173220	173221	that lad	3911	' Fagin began . Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping , as if he had not previously observed him . '
173252	173261	173263	173264	that lad	3911	' he said , resuming his former position . '
173266	173270	173263	173264	that lad	3911	' pursued Fagin , '
173297	173412	173414	173415	the Jew	1006	'em in the street to paint our likenesses , describe every mark that they might know us by , and the crib where we might be most easily taken . Suppose he was to do all this , and besides to blow upon a plant we 've all been in , more or less - of his own fancy ; not grabbed , trapped , tried , earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water , - but of his own fancy ; to please his own taste ; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us , and peaching to them .

173447	173481	173440	173440	Sikes	161	' If he was left alive till I came , I 'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head . '

173675	173738	173739	173739	Bolter	279	' Fagin looked hard at the robber ; and , motioning him to be silent , stooped over the bed upon the floor , and shook the sleeper to rouse him . Sikes leant forward in his chair : looking on with his hands upon his knees , as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in . '
173746	173767	173768	173768	He	279	' said Fagin , looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation , and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis . '

173793	173846	173790	173790	d'ye	3923	' asked Sikes , drawing back . Fagin made no answer , but bending over the sleeper again , hauled him into a sitting posture . When his assumed name had been repeated several times , Noah rubbed his eyes , and , giving a heavy yawn , looked sleepily about him . '

174166	174188	174189	174189	they	3930	' said Noah , who , as he grew more wakeful , seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was , '

174367	174392	174393	174393	Bill	161	' Flinging the old man from him , he rushed from the room , and darted , wildly and furiously , up the stairs . '
174397	174405	174395	174395	Bill	161	' cried Fagin , following him hastily . '
174413	174450	174395	174395	Bill	161	' The word would not have been exchanged , but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door : on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence , when the Jew came panting up . '

174602	174788	174595	174595	Bill	161	' Sikes made no reply ; but , pulling open the door , of which Fagin had turned the lock , dashed into the silent streets . Without one pause , or moment 's consideration ; without once turning his head to the right or left , or raising his eyes to the sky , or lowering them to the ground , but looking straight before him with savage resolution : his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin ; the robber held on his headlong course , nor muttered a word , nor relaxed a muscle , until he reached his own door . He opened it , softly , with a key ; strode lightly up the stairs ; and entering his own room , double - locked the door , and lifting a heavy table against it , drew back the curtain of the bed . The girl was lying , half - dressed , upon it . He had roused her from her sleep , for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look . '
174792	174797	174595	174595	Bill	161	' said the man . '
174804	174818	174800	174800	you	3936	' said the girl , with an expression of pleasure at his return . '
174822	174827	174800	174800	you	3936	' was the reply . '
174831	174872	174800	174800	you	3936	' There was a candle burning , but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick , and hurled it under the grate . Seeing the faint light of early day without , the girl rose to undraw the curtain . '
174877	174887	174800	174800	you	3936	' said Sikes , thrusting his hand before her . '

174904	174916	174902	174902	Bill	161	' said the girl , in the low voice of alarm , '
174926	174980	174919	174919	you	161	' The robber sat regarding her , for a few seconds , with dilated nostrils and heaving breast ; and then , grasping her by the head and throat , dragged her into the middle of the room , and looking once towards the door , placed his heavy hand upon her mouth . '
174985	174999	174983	174983	Bill	161	' gasped the girl , wrestling with the strength of mortal fear , - '

175035	175044	175031	175031	you	0	' returned the robber , suppressing his breath . '

175076	175085	175072	175072	I	0	' rejoined the girl , clinging to him . '
175184	175219	175220	175220	Bill	161	' The man struggled violently , to release his arms ; but those of the girl were clasped round his , and tear her as he would , he could not tear them away . '
175222	175236	175237	175238	the gentleman	4618	' cried the girl , striving to lay her head upon his breast , '
175355	176301	175333	175333	They	3942	' The housebreaker freed one arm , and grasped his pistol . The certainty of immediate detection if he fired , flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury ; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon , upon the upturned face that almost touched his own . She staggered and fell : nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead ; but raising herself , with difficulty , on her knees , drew from her bosom a white handkerchief - Rose Maylie 's own - and holding it up , in her folded hands , as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow , breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker . It was a ghastly figure to look upon . The murderer staggering backward to the wall , and shutting out the sight with his hand , seized a heavy club and struck her down . CHAPTER XLVIII THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that , under cover of the darkness , had been committed within wide London 's bounds since night hung over it , that was the worst . Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air , that was the foulest and most cruel . The sun - the bright sun , that brings back , not light alone , but new life , and hope , and freshness to man - burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory . Through costly - coloured glass and paper - mended window , through cathedral dome and rotten crevice , it shed its equal ray . It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay . It did . He tried to shut it out , but it would stream in . If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning , what was it , now , in all that brilliant light ! He had not moved ; he had been afraid to stir . There had been a moan and motion of the hand ; and , with terror added to rage , he had struck and struck again . Once he threw a rug over it ; but it was worse to fancy the eyes , and imagine them moving towards him , than to see them glaring upward , as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling . He had plucked it off again . And there was the body - mere flesh and blood , no more - but such flesh , and so much blood ! He struck a light , kindled a fire , and thrust the club into it . There was hair upon the end , which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder , and , caught by the air , whirled up the chimney . Even that frightened him , sturdy as he was ; but he held the weapon till it broke , and then piled it on the coals to burn away , and smoulder into ashes . He washed himself , and rubbed his clothes ; there were spots that would not be removed , but he cut the pieces out , and burnt them . How those stains were dispersed about the room ! The very feet of the dog were bloody . All this time he had , never once , turned his back upon the corpse ; no , not for a moment . Such preparations completed , he moved , backward , towards the door : dragging the dog with him , lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets . He shut the door softly , locked it , took the key , and left the house . He crossed over , and glanced up at the window , to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside . There was the curtain still drawn , which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again . It lay nearly under there . He knew that . God , how the sun poured down upon the very spot ! The glance was instantaneous . It was a relief to have got free of the room . He whistled on the dog , and walked rapidly away . He went through Islington ; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington ; turned down to Highgate Hill , unsteady of purpose , and uncertain where to go ; struck off to the right again , almost as soon as he began to descend it ; and taking the foot - path across the fields , skirted Caen Wood , and so came on Hampstead Heath . Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath , he mounted the opposite bank , and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate , made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End , in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge , and slept . Soon he was up again , and away , - not far into the country , but back towards London by the high - road - then back again - then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed - then wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches '

176953	177147	176947	176948	the fellow	7164	' this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain , rust , dirt , mildew , spick , speck , spot , or spatter , from silk , satin , linen , cambric , cloth , crape , stuff , carpet , merino , muslin , bombazeen , or woollen stuff . Wine - stains , fruit - stains , beer - stains , water - stains , paint - stains , pitch - stains , any stains , all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition . If a lady stains her honour , she has only need to swallow one cake and she 's cured at once - for it 's poison . If a gentleman wants to prove this , he has only need to bolt one little square , and he has put it beyond question - for it 's quite as satisfactory as a pistol - bullet , and a great deal nastier in the flavour , consequently the more credit in taking it . One penny a square . With all these virtues , one penny a square ! '

One penny a square ! Two half - pence is all the same , and four farthings is received with joy . One penny a square ! Wine - stains , fruit - stains , beer - stains , water - stains , paint - stains , pitch - stains , mud - stains , blood - stains ! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company , that I 'll take clean out , before he can order me a pint of ale . '

177848	177854	177846	177846	Ben	287	' replied the coachman impatiently . '

177888	177891	177893	177894	the guard	3996	' Coming , '
177896	177904	177893	177894	the guard	3996	' Ah , and so 's the young '
177935	179278	179279	179279	He	4008	' The horn sounded a few cheerful notes , and the coach was gone . Sikes remained standing in the street , apparently unmoved by what he had just heard , and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go . At length he went back again , and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans . He went on doggedly ; but as he left the town behind him , and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road , he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core . Every object before him , substance or shadow , still or moving , took the semblance of some fearful thing ; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning 's ghastly figure following at his heels . He could trace its shadow in the gloom , supply the smallest item of the outline , and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along . He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves , and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry . If he stopped it did the same . If he ran , it followed - not running too : that would have been a relief : but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life , and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell . At times , he turned , with desperate determination , resolved to beat this phantom off , though it should look him dead ; but the hair rose on his head , and his blood stood still , for it had turned with him and was behind him then . He had kept it before him that morning , but it was behind now - always . He leaned his back against a bank , and felt that it stood above him , visibly out against the cold night - sky . He threw himself upon the road - on his back upon the road . At his head it stood , silent , erect , and still - a living grave - stone , with its epitaph in blood . Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice , and hint that Providence must sleep . There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear . There was a shed in a field he passed , that offered shelter for the night . Before the door , were three tall poplar trees , which made it very dark within ; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail . He could not walk on , till daylight came again ; and here he stretched himself close to the wall - to undergo new torture . For now , a vision came before him , as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped . Those widely staring eyes , so lustreless and so glassy , that he had better borne to see them than think upon them , appeared in the midst of the darkness : light in themselves , but giving light to nothing . There were but two , but they were everywhere . If he shut out the sight , there came the room with every well - known object - some , indeed , that he would have forgotten , if he had gone over its contents from memory - each in its accustomed place . The body was in its place , and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away . He got up , and rushed into the field without . The figure was behind him . He re - entered the shed , and shrunk down once more . The eyes were there , before he had laid himself along . And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know , trembling in every limb , and the cold sweat starting from every pore , when suddenly there arose upon the night - wind the noise of distant shouting , and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder . Any sound of men in that lonely place , even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm , was something to him . He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger ; and springing to his feet , rushed into the open air . The broad sky seemed on fire . Rising into the air with showers of sparks , and rolling one above the other , were sheets of flame , lighting the atmosphere for miles round , and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood . The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar , and he could hear the cry of Fire ! mingled with the ringing of an alarm - bell , the fall of heavy bodies , and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle , and shot aloft as though refreshed by food . The noise increased as he looked . There were people there - men and women - light , bustle . It was like new life to him . He darted onward - straight , headlong - dashing through brier and brake , and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog , who careered with loud and sounding bark before him . He came upon the spot . There were half - dressed figures tearing to and fro , some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables , others driving the cattle from the yard and out - houses , and others coming laden from the burning pile , amidst a shower of falling sparks , and the tumbling down of red - hot beams . The apertures , where doors and windows stood an hour ago , disclosed a mass of raging fire ; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well ; the molten lead and iron poured down , white hot , upon the ground . Women and children shrieked , and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers . The clanking of the engine - pumps , and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood , added to the tremendous roar . He shouted , too , till he was hoarse ; and flying from memory and himself , plunged into the thickest of the throng . Hither and thither he dived that night : now working at the pumps , and now hurrying through the smoke and flame , but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest . Up and down the ladders , upon the roofs of buildings , over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight , under the lee of falling bricks and stones , in every part of that great fire was he ; but he bore a charmed life , and had neither scratch nor bruise , nor weariness nor thought , till morning dawned again , and only smoke and blackened ruins remained . This mad excitement over , there returned , with ten - fold force , the dreadful consciousness of his crime . He looked suspiciously about him , for the men were conversing in groups , and he feared to be the subject of their talk . The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger , and they drew off , stealthily , together . He passed near an engine where some men were seated , and they called to him to share in their refreshment . He took some bread and meat ; and as he drank a draught of beer , heard the firemen , who were from London , talking about the murder . '
179288	179292	179285	179285	they	4009	' said one : '
179322	179387	179285	179285	they	4009	' He hurried off , and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground ; then lay down in a lane , and had a long , but broken and uneasy sleep . He wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night . Suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to London . '
179400	179404	179390	179394	somebody to speak to there	4012	' he thought . '
179458	179672	179451	179451	Damme	231	' He acted upon this impulse without delay , and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back , resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis , and , entering it at dusk by a circuitous route , to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination . The dog , though . If any description of him were out , it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing , and had probably gone with him . This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets . He resolved to drown him , and walked on , looking about for a pond : picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went . The animal looked up into his master 's face while these preparations were making ; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose , or the robber 's sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary , he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual , and cowered as he came more slowly along . When his master halted at the brink of a pool , and looked round to call him , he stopped outright . '
179682	179718	179674	179674	you	4014	' cried Sikes . The animal came up from the very force of habit ; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat , he uttered a low growl and started back . '
179722	179979	179980	179980	He	4015	' said the robber . The dog wagged his tail , but moved not . Sikes made a running noose and called him again . The dog advanced , retreated , paused an instant , and scoured away at his hardest speed . The man whistled again and again , and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return . But no dog appeared , and at length he resumed his journey . CHAPTER XLIX MONKS AND MR . BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET . THEIR CONVERSATION , AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT The twilight was beginning to close in , when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney - coach at his own door , and knocked softly . The door being opened , a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps , while another man , who had been seated on the box , dismounted too , and stood upon the other side . At a sign from Mr. Brownlow , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house . This man was Monks . They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking , and Mr. Brownlow , preceding them , led the way into a back - room . At the door of this apartment , Monks , who had ascended with evident reluctance , stopped . The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions . '
179985	179990	179980	179980	He	4015	' said Mr. Browlow . '
180028	180029	180015	180016	the police	1595	' '
180038	180042	180032	180032	you	4016	' asked Monks . '
180054	180066	180045	180045	you	4016	' replied Mr. Brownlow , confronting him with a steady look . '
180146	180147	180138	180138	your	4564	' '
180165	180183	180185	180185	mine	4564	' asked Monks , looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him . '
180187	180192	180185	180185	mine	4564	' replied Mr. Brownlow . '
180297	180310	180311	180311	You	4564	' Monks was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides . He hesitated . '
180316	180327	180311	180311	You	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow , with perfect firmness and composure . '
180416	180427	180428	180428	You	4564	' Monks muttered some unintelligible words , but wavered still . '
180433	180438	180428	180428	You	4564	' said Mr. Brownlow . '
180452	180458	180428	180428	You	4564	' Still the man hesitated . '
180467	180472	180459	180459	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , '
180490	180491	180484	180484	I	0	' '
180495	180504	180484	180484	I	0	' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue , - '
180512	180513	180484	180484	I	0	' '
180516	180555	180484	180484	I	0	' Monks looked at the old gentleman , with an anxious eye ; but , reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination , walked into the room , and , shrugging his shoulders , sat down . '
180563	180571	180484	180484	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants , '
180578	180591	180575	180575	I	0	' The men obeyed , and the two were left alone together . '
180599	180610	180597	180597	sir	4564	' said Monks , throwing down his hat and cloak , '
180618	180619	180612	180616	my father 's oldest friend	4029	' '
180634	180639	180631	180632	young man	2626	' returned Mr. Brownlow ; '
180695	180810	180823	180824	the other	4696	' death - bed when he was yet a boy , on the morning that would - but Heaven willed otherwise - have made her my young wife ; it is because my seared heart clung to him , from that time forth , through all his trials and errors , till he died ; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart , and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him ; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now - yes , Edward Leeford , even now - and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name . '
180811	180821	180823	180824	the other	4696	' What has the name to do with it ? '
180845	180853	180823	180824	the other	4696	' What is the name to me ? '
180854	180857	180859	180860	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Nothing , '
180862	180919	180859	180860	Mr. Brownlow	194	' nothing to you . But it was hers , and even at this distance of time brings back to me , an old man , the glow and thrill which I once felt , only to hear it repeated by a stranger . I am very glad you have changed it - very - very . '
180920	180927	180929	180929	Monks	133	' This is all mighty fine , '
180966	180975	180963	180963	his	194	' But what do you want with me ? '
180976	180982	180984	180985	Mr. Brownlow	194	' You have a brother , '
180990	181030	180988	180988	himself	194	' a brother , the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street , was , in itself , almost enough to make you accompany me hither , in wonder and alarm . '
181031	181037	181039	181039	Monks	133	' I have no brother , '
181041	181067	181039	181039	Monks	133	' You know I was an only child . Why do you talk to me of brothers ? You know that , as well as I. '
181068	181081	181083	181084	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Attend to what I do know , and you may not , '
181086	181136	181083	181084	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I shall interest you by and by . I know that of the wretched marriage , into which family pride , and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition , forced your unhappy father when a mere boy , you were the sole and most unnatural issue . '
181137	181146	181148	181148	Monks	133	' I do n't care for hard names , '
181154	181167	181148	181148	Monks	133	' You know the fact , and that 's enough for me . '
181168	181174	181176	181178	the old gentleman	4702	' But I also know , '
181180	181320	181176	181178	the old gentleman	4702	' the misery , the slow torture , the protracted anguish of that ill - assorted union . I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both . I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts ; how indifference gave place to dislike , dislike to hate , and hate to loathing , until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder , and retiring a wide space apart , carried each a galling fragment , of which nothing but death could break the rivets , to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume . Your mother succeeded ; she forgot it soon . But it rusted and cankered at your father 's heart for years . '
181321	181328	181330	181330	Monks	133	' Well , they were separated , '
181332	181338	181330	181330	Monks	133	' and what of that ? '
181339	181349	181176	181178	the old gentleman	4702	' When they had been separated for some time , '
181354	181405	181351	181352	Mr. Brownlow	194	' and your mother , wholly given up to continental frivolities , had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior , who , with prospects blighted , lingered on at home , he fell among new friends . This circumstance , at least , you know already . '
181406	181410	181412	181412	Monks	133	' Not I , '
181436	181439	181351	181352	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Not I. '
181440	181468	181470	181471	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Your manner , no less than your actions , assures me that you have never forgotten it , or ceased to think of it with bitterness , '
181473	181549	181470	181471	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I speak of fifteen years ago , when you were not more than eleven years old , and your father but one - and - thirty - for he was , I repeat , a boy , when his father ordered him to marry . Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent , or will you spare it , and disclose to me the truth ? '
181550	181557	181559	181559	Monks	133	' I have nothing to disclose , '
181561	181570	181470	181471	Mr. Brownlow	194	' You must talk on if you will . '
181571	181578	181580	181581	Mr. Brownlow	194	' These new friends , then , '
181583	181654	181580	181581	Mr. Brownlow	194	' were a naval officer retired from active service , whose wife had died some half - a - year before , and left him with two children - there had been more , but , of all their family , happily but two survived . They were both daughters ; one a beautiful creature of nineteen , and the other a mere child of two or three years old . '
181655	181662	181664	181664	Monks	133	' What 's this to me ? '
181666	181670	181672	181673	Mr. Brownlow	194	' They resided , '
181682	181768	181672	181673	Mr. Brownlow	194	' in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired , and where he had taken up his abode . Acquaintance , intimacy , friendship , fast followed on each other . Your father was gifted as few men are . He had his sister 's soul and person . As the old officer knew him more and more , he grew to love him . I would that it had ended there . His daughter did the same . '
181795	181829	181791	181791	he	133	' The end of a year found him contracted , solemnly contracted , to that daughter ; the object of the first , true , ardent , only passion of a guileless girl . '
181830	181838	181840	181840	Monks	133	' Your tale is of the longest , '
181848	181865	181867	181868	Mr. Brownlow	194	' It is a true tale of grief and trial , and sorrow , young man , '
181870	182034	181867	181868	Mr. Brownlow	194	' and such tales usually are ; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness , it would be very brief . At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed , as others are often - it is no uncommon case - died , and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning , left him his panacea for all griefs - Money . It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome , whither this man had sped for health , and where he had died , leaving his affairs in great confusion . He went ; was seized with mortal illness there ; was followed , the moment the intelligence reached Paris , by your mother who carried you with her ; he died the day after her arrival , leaving no will - no will - so that the whole property fell to her and you . '
182094	182110	182112	182113	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Before he went abroad , and as he passed through London on his way , '
182127	182133	182119	182119	his	194	' he came to me . '
182134	182141	182143	182143	MOnks	133	' I never heard of that , '
182159	182374	182143	182143	MOnks	133	' He came to me , and left with me , among some other things , a picture - a portrait painted by himself - a likeness of this poor girl - which he did not wish to leave behind , and could not carry forward on his hasty journey . He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow ; talked in a wild , distracted way , of ruin and dishonour worked by himself ; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property , at any loss , into money , and , having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition , to fly the country - I guessed too well he would not fly alone - and never see it more . Even from me , his old and early friend , whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both - even from me he withheld any more particular confession , promising to write and tell me all , and after that to see me once again , for the last time on earth . Alas ! That was the last time . I had no letter , and I never saw him more . '
182375	182379	182381	182382	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I went , '
182389	182493	182381	182382	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I went , when all was over , to the scene of his - I will use the term the world would freely use , for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him - of his guilty love , resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her . The family had left that part a week before ; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night . Why , or whither , none can tell . '
182511	182516	182518	182519	Mr. Brownlow	194	' When your brother , '
182529	182566	182518	182519	Mr. Brownlow	194	' When your brother : a feeble , ragged , neglected child : was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance , and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy - '
182567	182570	182572	182572	Monks	133	' What ? '
182574	182578	182580	182581	Mr. Brownlow	194	' By me , '
182583	182713	182580	182581	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I told you I should interest you before long . I say by me - I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name , although for ought he knew , it would be quite strange to your ears . When he was rescued by me , then , and lay recovering from sickness in my house , his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of , struck me with astonishment . Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery , there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream . I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history - '
182714	182718	182720	182720	Monks	133	' Why not ? '
182723	182730	182720	182720	Monks	133	' Because you know it well . '
182731	182734	182580	182581	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I ! '
182735	182742	182744	182745	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Denial to me is vain , '
182747	182759	182744	182745	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I shall show you that I know more than that . '
182760	182772	182774	182774	Monks	133	' You - you - ca n't prove anything against me , '
182776	182784	182774	182774	Monks	133	' I defy you to do it ! '
182785	182790	182792	182794	the old gentleman	4702	' We shall see , '
182800	183005	182792	182794	the old gentleman	4702	' I lost the boy , and no efforts of mine could recover him . Your mother being dead , I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could , and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies - whither , as you well know , you retired upon your mother 's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here - I made the voyage . You had left it , months before , and were supposed to be in London , but no one could tell where . I returned . Your agents had no clue to your residence . You came and went , they said , as strangely as you had ever done : sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months : keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy . I wearied them with new applications . I paced the streets by night and day , but until two hours ago , all my efforts were fruitless , and I never saw you for an instant . '
183006	183014	183016	183016	Monks	133	' And now you do see me , '
183021	183080	183016	183016	Monks	133	' what then ? Fraud and robbery are high - sounding words - justified , you think , by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man 's Brother ! You do n't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair ; you do n't even know that . '
183081	183086	183088	183089	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I did not , '
183094	183370	183088	183089	Mr. Brownlow	194	' but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all . You have a brother ; you know it , and him . There was a will , which your mother destroyed , leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death . It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection , which child was born , and accidentally encountered by you , when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father . You repaired to the place of his birth . There existed proofs - proofs long suppressed - of his birth and parentage . Those proofs were destroyed by you , and now , in your own words to your accomplice the Jew , " the only proofs of the boy 's identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . " Unworthy son , coward , liar , - you , who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night , - you , whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you , - you , who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father 's heart , and in whom all evil passions , vice , and profligacy , festered , till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind - you , Edward Leeford , do you still brave me ! '
183371	183378	183380	183381	the coward	4043	' No , no , no ! '
183389	183393	183395	183396	the gentleman	4618	' Every word ! '
183398	183471	183395	183396	the gentleman	4618	' every word that has passed between you and this detested villain , is known to me . Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers , and brought them to my ear ; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself , and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue . Murder has been done , to which you were morally if not really a party . '
183472	183477	183479	183479	Monks	133	' No , no , '
183481	183520	183479	183479	Monks	133	' I - I knew nothing of that ; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me . I did n't know the cause . I thought it was a common quarrel . '
183521	183531	183533	183534	Mr. Brownlow	194	' It was the partial disclosure of your secrets , '
183536	183543	183533	183534	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Will you disclose the whole ? '
183544	183550	183479	183479	Monks	133	' Yes , I will . '
183551	183569	183479	183479	Monks	133	' Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts , and repeat it before witnesses ? '
183570	183576	183479	183479	Monks	133	' That I promise too . '
183577	183612	183479	183479	Monks	133	' Remain quietly here , until such a document is drawn up , and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable , for the purpose of attesting it ? '
183613	183626	183628	183628	Monks	133	' If you insist upon that , I 'll do that also , '
183630	183638	183640	183641	Mr. Brownlow	194	' You must do more than that , '
183643	183707	183640	183641	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child , for such he is , although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love . You have not forgotten the provisions of the will . Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned , and then go where you please . In this world you need meet no more . '
183765	183772	183773	183773	he	4045	' The man will be taken , '
183776	183785	183773	183773	he	4045	' He will be taken to - night ! '
183786	183790	183792	183793	Mr. Brownlow	194	' The murderer ? '
183795	183800	183802	183803	the other	4696	' Yes , yes , '
183805	183884	183802	183803	the other	4696	' His dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt , and there seems little doubt that his master either is , or will be , there , under cover of the darkness . Spies are hovering about in every direction . I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture , and they tell me he can not escape . A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to - night . '
183885	183892	183894	183895	Mr. Brownlow	194	' I will give fifty more , '
183897	183920	183894	183895	Mr. Brownlow	194	' and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot , if I can reach it . Where is Mr. Maylie ? '
183921	183950	183952	183953	the doctor	5019	' Harry ? As soon as he had seen your friend here , safe in a coach with you , he hurried off to where he heard this , '
183955	183978	183952	183953	the doctor	5019	' and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them . '
183979	183982	183984	183985	Mr. Brownlow	194	' Fagin , '
183987	183992	183984	183985	Mr. Brownlow	194	' what of him ? '

CHAPTER L THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts , where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close - built low - roofed houses , there exists the filthiest , the strangest , the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London , wholly unknown , even by name , to the great mass of its inhabitants . To reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion . The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops ; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman 's door , and stream from the house - parapet and windows . Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class , ballast - heavers , coal - whippers , brazen women , ragged children , and the raff and refuse of the river , he makes his way with difficulty along , assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left , and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner . Arriving , at length , in streets remoter and less - frequented than those through which he has passed , he walks beneath tottering house - fronts projecting over the pavement , dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes , chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall , windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away , every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect . In such a neighborhood , beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark , stands Jacob 's Island , surrounded by a muddy ditch , six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in , once called Mill Pond , but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch . It is a creek or inlet from the Thames , and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name . At such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up ; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him . Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses , with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath ; windows , broken and patched , with poles thrust out , on which to dry the linen that is never there ; rooms so small , so filthy , so confined , that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter ; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud , and threatening to fall into it - as some have done ; dirt - besmeared walls and decaying foundations ; every repulsive lineament of poverty , every loathsome indication of filth , rot , and garbage ; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch . In Jacob 's Island , the warehouses are roofless and empty ; the walls are crumbling down ; the windows are windows no more ; the doors are falling into the streets ; the chimneys are blackened , but they yield no smoke . Thirty or forty years ago , before losses and chancery suits came upon it , it was a thriving place ; but now it is a desolate island indeed . The houses have no owners ; they are broken open , and entered upon by those who have the courage ; and there they live , and there they die . They must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in Jacob 's Island . In an upper room of one of these houses - a detached house of fair size , ruinous in other respects , but strongly defended at door and window : of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described - there were assembled three men , who , regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence . One of these was Toby Crackit , another Mr. Chitling , and the third a robber of fifty years , whose nose had been almost beaten in , in some old scuffle , and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion . This man was a returned transport , and his name was Kags . '
185188	185196	185185	185185	I	0	' said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling , '
185224	185225	185220	185222	my fine feller	4063	' '

185258	185268	185244	185244	you	0	' replied Mr. Chitling , with a melancholy air . '

185397	185438	185391	185392	the Judges	4072	' added Mr. Kags . There was a short silence , after which Toby Crackit , seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil - may - care swagger , turned to Chitling and said , '

185589	185593	185594	185594	He	179	' demanded Kags . '
185613	185617	185607	185607	he	179	' replied Chitling . '

185669	185677	185607	185607	he	179	' observed Toby , biting his lips . '

185695	185699	185701	185701	they	4075	' said Kags : '

While he was thus engaged , and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor , a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs , and Sikes 's dog bounded into the room . They ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street . The dog had jumped in at an open window ; he made no attempt to follow them , nor was his master to be seen . '
186043	186051	186052	186052	He	279	' said Toby when they had returned . '

186252	186261	186263	186263	he	279	' said Chitling . Toby shook his head . '

186592	186600	186584	186586	the other man	2037	' None . He must come in . '

186698	186829	186679	186679	He	209	' growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath ; it was the very ghost of Sikes . He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room , but shuddering as he was about to drop into it , and seeming to glance over his shoulder , dragged it back close to the wall - as close as it would go - and ground it against it - and sat down . Not a word had been exchanged . He looked from one to another in silence . If an eye were furtively raised and met his , it was instantly averted . When his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started . They seemed never to have heard its tones before . '
186836	186840	186679	186679	He	209	' he asked . '
186847	186848	186679	186679	He	209	' '
186868	186869	186679	186679	He	209	' '
186872	186878	186679	186679	He	209	' They were silent again . '
186883	186894	186679	186679	He	209	' said Sikes , passing his hand across his forehead . '
186903	186916	186896	186896	you	4101	' There was an uneasy movement among them , but nobody spoke . '
186923	186933	186935	186935	you	4101	' said Sikes , turning his face to Crackit , '
186953	186954	186935	186935	you	4101	' '
186966	187001	186955	186955	You	4101	' returned the person addressed , after some hesitation . Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him : rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it : and said , '
187013	187019	187038	187038	they	4103	' They shook their heads . '
187025	187035	187038	187038	they	4103	' he retorted with the same glance behind him . '
187054	187107	187108	187108	Toby	209	' Crackit intimated , by a motion of his hand as he left the room , that there was nothing to fear ; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him . Sikes sat opposite the door , so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure . '
187110	187125	187108	187108	Toby	209	' said the boy falling back , as Sikes turned his eyes towards him , '
187136	187178	187129	187129	you	209	' There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three , that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad . Accordingly he nodded , and made as though he would shake hands with him . '
187187	187196	187197	187197	Charley	179	' said the boy , retreating still farther . '
187199	187206	187197	187197	Charley	179	' said Sikes , stepping forward . '
187217	187218	187213	187213	you	179	' '
187225	187248	187249	187250	You monster	4106	' answered the boy , still retreating , and looking , with horror in his eyes , upon the murderer 's face . '
187252	187277	187249	187250	You monster	4106	' The man stopped half - way , and they looked at each other ; but Sikes 's eyes sunk gradually to the ground . '
187282	187301	187279	187279	you	4107	' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist , and becoming more and more excited as he spoke . '
187307	187404	187279	187279	you	4107	'm not afraid of him - if they come here after him , I 'll give him up ; I will . I tell you out at once . He may kill me for it if he likes , or if he dares , but if I am here I 'll give him up . I 'd give him up if he was to be boiled alive . Murder ! Help ! If there 's the pluck of a man among you three , you 'll help me . Murder ! Help ! Down with him ! '
187657	187660	187662	187663	the boy	437	' Help ! '
187672	187682	187662	187663	the boy	437	' He 's here ! Break down the door ! '
187683	187690	187770	187771	the crowd	5297	' In the King 's name , '
187706	187712	187714	187715	the boy	437	' Break down the door ! '
187717	187742	187743	187743	Strokes	295	' I tell you they 'll never open it . Run straight to the room where the light is . Break down the door ! '
187790	187807	187809	187809	Sikes	161	' Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell - babe , '
187834	187840	187841	187841	He	161	' That door . Quick ! '
187854	187861	187841	187841	He	161	' Is the downstairs door fast ? '
187862	187869	187871	187871	Crackit	209	' Double - locked and chained , '
187888	187896	187871	187871	Crackit	209	' The panels - are they strong ? '
187897	187904	187841	187841	He	161	' Lined with sheet - iron . '
187905	187911	187841	187841	He	161	' And the windows too ? '
187912	187919	187841	187841	He	161	' Yes , and the windows . '
187920	187924	187926	187928	the desperate ruffian	4126	' Damn you ! '
187939	187950	187926	187928	the desperate ruffian	4126	' Do your worst ! I 'll cheat you yet ! '
188047	188058	188072	188072	Some	7783	' Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder ! '
188186	188190	188192	188193	the murderer	8425	' The tide , '
188209	188229	188196	188196	he	8425	' the tide was in as I came up . Give me a rope , a long rope . They 're
188264	188705	188706	188706	They	4144	' The panic - stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept ; the murderer , hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord , hurried up to the house - top . All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up , except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked , and that was too small even for the passage of his body . But , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back ; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house - top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream . He planted a board , which he had carried up with him for the purpose , so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside ; and creeping over the tiles , looked over the low parapet . The water was out , and the ditch a bed of mud . The crowd had been hushed during these few moments , watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose , but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated , they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers . Again and again it rose . Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning , took up the sound ; it echoed and re - echoed ; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him . On pressed the people from the front - on , on , on , in a strong struggling current of angry faces , with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up , and show them out in all their wrath and passion . The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob ; sashes were thrown up , or torn bodily out ; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window ; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house - top . Each little bridge and there were three in sight bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it . Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts , and only for an instant see the wretch . '
188711	188720	188706	188706	They	4144	' cried a man on the nearest bridge . '
188723	188738	188739	188739	I	0	' The crowd grew light with uncovered heads ; and again the shout uprose . '
188745	188755	188739	188739	I	0	' cried an old gentleman from the same quarter , '
188778	189273	188770	188770	he	4146	' There was another roar . At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last , and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room . The stream abruptly turned , as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth ; and the people at the windows , seeing those upon the bridges pouring back , quitted their stations , and running into the street , joined the concourse that now thronged pell - mell to the spot they had left : each man crushing and striving with his neighbor , and all panting with impatience to get near the door , and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out . The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation , or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion , were dreadful ; the narrow ways were completely blocked up ; and at this time , between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house , and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass , the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer , although the universal eagerness for his capture was , if possible , increased . The man had shrunk down , thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd , and the impossibility of escape ; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred , he sprang upon his feet , determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch , and , at the risk of being stifled , endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion . Roused into new strength and energy , and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected , he set his foot against the stack of chimneys , fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it , and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second . He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height , and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop . At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm - pits , and when the old gentleman before - mentioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd , and retain his position earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down - at that very instant the murderer , looking behind him on the roof , threw his arms above his head , and uttered a yell of terror . '
189278	189756	188770	188770	he	4146	' he cried in an unearthly screech . Staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet . The noose was on his neck . It ran up with his weight , tight as a bow - string , and swift as the arrow it speeds . He fell for five - and - thirty feet . There was a sudden jerk , a terrific convulsion of the limbs ; and there he hung , with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand . The old chimney quivered with the shock , but stood it bravely . The murderer swung lifeless against the wall ; and the boy , thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view , called to the people to come and take him out , for God 's sake . A dog , which had lain concealed till now , ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl , and collecting himself for a spring , jumped for the dead man 's shoulders . Missing his aim , he fell into the ditch , turning completely over as he went ; and striking his head against a stone , dashed out his brains . CHAPTER LI AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE , AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN - MONEY The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old , when Oliver found himself , at three o'clock in the afternoon , in a travelling - carriage rolling fast towards his native town . Mrs. Maylie , and Rose , and Mrs. Bedwin , and the good doctor were with him : and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post - chaise , accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned . They had not talked much upon the way ; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts , and almost of speech , and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions , who shared it , in at least an equal degree . He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks ; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun , still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense . The same kind friend had , with Mr. Losberne 's assistance , cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place . '
189762	189766	188770	188770	he	4146	' he said , '
189796	189920	189768	189768	they	4147	' So , they travelled on in silence : each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together : and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all . But if Oliver , under these influences , had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth - place by a road he had never seen , how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times , and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast , when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot : a poor houseless , wandering boy , without a friend to help him , or a roof to shelter his head . '
189926	189945	189768	189768	they	4147	' cried Oliver , eagerly clasping the hand of Rose , and pointing out at the carriage window ; '
190012	190013	190014	190014	You	0	' '
190020	190033	190014	190014	You	0	' replied Rose , gently taking his folded hands between her own . '
190071	190072	190086	190086	we	4153	' '
190077	190081	190086	190086	we	4153	' said Oliver , '
190121	190124	190119	190119	we	4153	' Rose nodded '
190127	190143	190119	190119	we	4153	' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak . '
190160	190164	190154	190154	you	0	' said Oliver . '
190233	190244	190219	190219	He	4152	' cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion ; '
190266	190921	190246	190246	I	0	' As they approached the town , and at length drove through its narrow streets , it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds . There was Sowerberry 's the undertaker 's just as it used to be , only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it - there were all the well - known shops and houses , with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected - there was Gamfield 's cart , the very cart he used to have , standing at the old public - house door - there was the workhouse , the dreary prison of his youthful days , with its dismal windows frowning on the street - there was the same lean porter standing at the gate , at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back , and then laughed at himself for being so foolish , then cried , then laughed again - there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well - there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday , and all his recent life had been but a happy dream . But it was pure , earnest , joyful reality . They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel which Oliver used to stare up at , with awe , and think a mighty palace , but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size ; and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them , kissing the young lady , and the old one too , when they got out of the coach , as if he were the grandfather of the whole party , all smiles and kindness , and not offering to eat his head - no , not once ; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London , and maintained he knew it best , though he had only come that way once , and that time fast asleep . There was dinner prepared , and there were bedrooms ready , and everything was arranged as if by magic . Notwithstanding all this , when the hurry of the first half - hour was over , the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down . Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner , but remained in a separate room . The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces , and , during the short intervals when they were present , conversed apart . Once , Mrs. Maylie was called away , and after being absent for nearly an hour , returned with eyes swollen with weeping . All these things made Rose and Oliver , who were not in any new secrets , nervous and uncomfortable . They sat wondering , in silence ; or , if they exchanged a few words , spoke in whispers , as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices . At length , when nine o'clock had come , and they began to think they were to hear no more that night , Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room , followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see ; for they told him it was his brother , and it was the same man he had met at the market - town , and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room . Monks cast a look of hate , which , even then , he could not dissemble , at the astonished boy , and sat down near the door . Mr. Brownlow , who had papers in his hand , walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated . '

191019	191037	191016	191017	This child	4161	' said Mr. Brownlow , drawing Oliver to him , and laying his hand upon his head , '

191074	191094	191060	191061	Agnes Fleming	269	' said Monks , scowling at the trembling boy : the beating of whose heart he might have heard . '

191108	191115	191105	191105	you	4158	' said Mr. Brownlow , sternly , '

191166	191172	191173	191173	You	4158	' was the sullen reply . '

191328	191337	191327	191327	yourself	4178	' ; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow ; '

191394	191399	191380	191380	Agnes	269	' asked Mr. Brownlow . '

191648	191664	191640	191640	he	426	' said Mr. Brownlow , as Oliver 's tears fell fast . Monks was silent . '
191668	191677	191687	191687	He	426	' said Mr. Brownlow , speaking for him , '

191932	191941	191929	191930	My mother	5014	' said Monks , in a louder tone , '
192117	192136	192150	192154	Edward Leeford 's - mother	4211	' There was a short silence here , until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative . '
192141	192145	192146	192147	this man	4708	' he said , '

192255	192259	192273	192273	she	4211	' said Monks , '
192446	192543	192438	192438	I	0	' As the villain folded his arms tight together , and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice , Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him , and explained that the Jew , who had been his old accomplice and confidant , had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared : of which some part was to be given up , in the event of his being rescued : and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him . '
192549	192558	192438	192438	I	0	' said Mr. Brownlow , turning to Monks . '
192586	192594	192595	192595	You	4219	' answered Monks without raising his eyes . '
192602	192633	192595	192595	You	4219	' Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig , who disappearing with great alacrity , shortly returned , pushing in Mrs. Bumble , and dragging her unwilling consort after him . '
192641	192652	192656	192657	little Oliver	123	' cried Mr. Bumble , with ill - feigned enthusiasm , '

192898	192904	192889	192889	you	583	' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly . '

192993	193044	193045	193045	You	583	' Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig ; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness . But not again did he return with a stout man and wife ; for this time , he led in two palsied women , who shook and tottered as they walked . '
193055	193066	193045	193045	You	583	' said the foremost one , raising her shrivelled hand , '

193476	193494	193471	193471	She	132	' urged Mr. Bumble ; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room . '
193500	193505	193506	193506	You	4241	' replied Mr. Brownlow . '

193615	193649	193650	193651	Young lady	3400	' Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words , Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight , and putting his hands in his pockets , followed his helpmate downstairs . '

A father , sister , and mother , were gained , and lost , in that one moment . Joy and grief were mingled in the cup ; but there were no bitter tears : for even grief itself arose so softened , and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections , that it became a solemn pleasure , and lost all character of pain . They were a long , long time alone . A soft tap at the door , at length announced that some one was without . Oliver opened it , glided away , and gave place to Harry Maylie . '
