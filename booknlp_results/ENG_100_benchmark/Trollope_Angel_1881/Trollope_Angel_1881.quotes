2686	2710	2712	2713	Lady Tringle	282	Tringle,--"As you are the eldest , dear , we think that you will be best able to be a comfort to your aunt , "
2715	2727	2729	2729	Lucy	266	" I will do the best I can , Aunt Emmeline , "
2748	2772	2729	2729	Lucy	266	" I am sure you will . Poor dear Ayala is younger than her cousins , and will be more subject to them . "
2790	2810	2786	2786	she	266	" I am sure you will agree with me that it is best that we should have the youngest . "
2811	2819	2834	2835	Lady Tringle	282	" Perhaps it is , Aunt Emmeline . "
2820	2832	2834	2835	Lady Tringle	282	" Sir Thomas would not have had it any other way , "
2882	2916	2858	2858	she	282	" But , my dear , we shall see you very often , you know . It is not so far across the park ; and when we do have a few parties again-- "
2917	2929	2971	2972	her aunt	737	" Oh , aunt , I am not thinking of that . "
2930	2969	2858	2858	she	282	" Of course not . We can none of us think of it just now . But when the time does come of course we shall always have you , just as if you were one of us . "
3051	3063	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" I wish it were you , with all my heart , "
3072	3080	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" It could not have been me . "
3081	3085	3069	3069	her	287	" Why not ! "
3086	3098	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Because you are so pretty and you are so clever . "
3099	3102	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" No ! "
3103	3130	3069	3069	her	287	" Yes ! If we were to be separated of course it would be so . Do not suppose , dear , that I am disappointed . "
3131	3135	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" I am . "
3136	3143	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" If I can only like Aunt Margaret,"--Aunt
3186	3198	3065	3065	Ayala	287	own,--"I shall do better with her than you would , Ayala . "
3199	3206	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" I do n't see why . "
3207	3241	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Because I can remain quiet longer than you . It will be very quiet . I wonder how we shall see each other ! I can not walk across the park alone . "
3242	3249	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Uncle Reg will bring you . "
3250	3267	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Not often , I fear . Uncle Reg has enough to do with his office . "
3268	3276	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" You can come in a cab . "
3277	3285	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Cabs cost money , Ayey dear . "
3286	3290	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" But Uncle Thomas-- "
3291	3382	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" We had better understand one or two things , Ayala . Uncle Thomas will pay everything for you , and as he is very rich things will come as they are wanted . There will be cabs , and if not cabs , carriages . Uncle Reg must pay for me , and he is very very kind to do so . But as he is not rich , there will be no carriages , and not a great many cabs . It is best to understand it all . "
3383	3391	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" But they will send for you . "
3392	3445	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" That 's as they please . I do n't think they will very often . I would not for the world put you against Uncle Thomas , but I have a feeling that I shall never get on with him . But you will never separate yourself from me , Ayala ! "
3446	3450	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Separate myself ! "
3451	3470	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" You will not -- not be my sister because you will be one of these rich ones ? "
3471	3513	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" Oh , I wish,--I wish that I were to be the poor one . I 'm sure I should like it best . I never cared about being rich . Oh , Lucy , ca n't we make them change ? "
3514	3558	3065	3065	Ayala	287	" No , Ayey , my own , we ca n't make them change . And if we could , we would n't . It is altogether best that you should be a rich Tringle and that I should be a poor Dosett . "
3559	3567	3569	3569	Ayala	287	" I will always be a Dormer , "
3573	3620	3569	3569	Ayala	287	" And I will always be so too , my pet . But you should be a bright Dormer among the Tringles , and I will be a dull Dormer among the Dosetts . I shall begrudge nothing , if only we can see each other . "
5778	5792	5793	5794	Mrs. Dosett	285	" My dear , what do you like to do with your time ? "
5939	5949	5951	5951	Lucy	266	" I 'll do anything you like , aunt , "
5953	5978	5951	5951	Lucy	266	" It is not for me , my dear . I get through a deal of work , and am obliged to do so . "
6081	6095	6097	6098	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't want to burden you with my task - work , "
6100	6111	6097	6098	Mrs. Dosett	285	" but I am afraid you seem to be listless . "
6112	6122	6124	6124	Lucy	266	" I was reading till just before you spoke , "
6156	6174	6175	6175	Lucy	266	" Reading is very well , but I do not like it as an excuse , Lucy . "
6202	6261	6190	6190	she	266	" I am quite sure that for young girls , as well as for old women , there must be a great deal of waste time unless there be needle and thread always about . And I know , too , unless ladies are well off , they can not afford to waste time any more than gentlemen . "
6379	6385	6352	6352	she	285	" Idylls of the King , "
6544	6553	6555	6556	her aunt	737	" I did not mean to vex you , "
6558	6570	6572	6572	Lucy	266	" I was thinking of my -- darling , darling mamma , "
6574	6644	6572	6572	Lucy	266	" Of course , Lucy , you will think of her . How should you not ? And of your father . Those are sorrows which must be borne . But sorrows such as those are much lighter to the busy than to the idle . I sometimes think that the labourers grieve less for those they love than we do just because they have not time to grieve . "
6645	6654	6656	6656	Lucy	266	" I wish I were a labourer then , "
6662	6688	6656	6656	Lucy	266	" You may be if you will . The sooner you begin to be a labourer the better for yourself and for those about you . "
6752	6755	6759	6760	Aunt Dosett	901	" those about you,"--who
6795	6802	6803	6803	she	900	" Give it me at once , "
6829	6836	6837	6837	she	266	" Give it me at once , "
6855	6865	6867	6868	Aunt Dosett	905	" I did not mean anything of the kind , "
6870	6905	6867	6868	Aunt Dosett	905	" You should not take me up in that way . I am speaking only for your good , because I know that you should not dawdle away your existence . Leave the sheet . "
7326	7342	7316	7317	Aunt Emmeline,--was	301	" The sooner you begin to labour the better for yourself and those about you . "
7552	7572	7573	7573	she	287	" Oh , Ayala , my darling,--my own one ; oh , Ayala , if you did but know ! "
7607	7614	7615	7615	she	287	" I will never tell her , "
7620	7631	7615	7615	she	287	" I will die , and she shall never know . "
7805	7818	7819	7819	she	287	" If it had been the workhouse I could have borne it , "
7824	7836	7819	7819	she	287	" but not to be the slave of my Aunt Dosett ! "
7844	7856	7838	7838	she	287	" Oh , Ayala , if you did but know it ! "
7876	7890	7891	7891	she	287	" If one had to bear it , it was better for me , "
8149	8161	8163	8164	Aunt Dosett	959	" You have got very little to say to a person ? "
8199	8207	8209	8209	Lucy	266	" I have very little to say , "
8215	8219	8209	8209	Lucy	266	" But why ? "
8220	8226	8228	8228	Lucy	266	" Because I am stupid , "
8230	8243	8228	8228	Lucy	266	" Stupid people ca n't talk . You should have had Ayala . "
8244	8257	8209	8209	Lucy	266	" I hope you do not envy Ayala her fortune , Lucy ? "
8341	8344	8346	8346	Lucy	266	" Envy ! "
8359	8373	8346	8346	Lucy	266	" I sometimes think it is very hard to know what envy is . "
8374	8382	8384	8385	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Envy , hatred , and malice , "
8402	8412	8414	8414	Lucy	266	" I do know what hatred and malice are , "
8416	8424	8414	8414	Lucy	266	" Do you think I hate Ayala ? "
8425	8433	8346	8346	Lucy	266	" I am sure you do not . "
8434	8442	8346	8346	Lucy	266	" Or that I bear her malice ? "
8443	8447	8414	8414	Lucy	266	" Certainly not . "
8448	8543	8346	8346	Lucy	266	" If I had the power to take anything from her , would I do it ? I love Ayala with my whole heart . Whatever be my misery I would rather bear it than let Ayala have even a share of it . Whatever good things she may have I would not rob her even of a part of them . If there be joy and sorrow to be divided between us I would wish to have the sorrow so that she might have the joy . That is not hatred and malice . "
8571	8587	8589	8589	Lucy	266	" But , when you ask me whether I envy her , I hardly know , "
8591	8620	8589	8589	Lucy	266	" I think one does covet one 's neighbour 's house , in spite of the tenth commandment , even though one does not want to steal it . "
9056	9072	9073	9073	she	266	" We have done the best for you that is in our power , Lucy , "
9086	9093	9073	9073	she	266	" Have I complained , aunt ? "
9094	9100	9083	9083	her	266	" I thought you did . "
9101	9141	9083	9083	her	266	" Oh , no ! You asked me whether I envied Ayala . What was I to say ? Perhaps I should have said nothing , but the idea of envying Ayala was painful to me . Of course she-- "
9142	9145	9073	9073	she	266	" Well ? "
9146	9181	9083	9083	her	266	" I had better say nothing more , aunt . If I were to pretend to be cheerful I should be false . It is as yet only a few weeks since papa died . "
10070	10078	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" And now tell me about everything , "
10093	10099	10087	10087	she	266	" I am so wretched ! "
10114	10123	10124	10124	she	266	" We are so quiet in Kingsbury Crescent , "
10127	10137	10124	10124	she	266	" you have so much more to talk of . "
10138	10149	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Oh , Lucy , I do not like it . "
10150	10155	10107	10107	she	266	" Not your aunt ? "
10156	10204	10124	10124	she	266	" She is not the worst , though she sometimes is hard to bear . I ca n't tell you what it is , but they all seem to think so much of themselves . In the first place they never will say a word about papa . "
10205	10214	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Perhaps that is from feeling , Ayey . "
10215	10249	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" No , it is not . One would know that . But they look down upon papa , who had more in his little finger than they have with all their money . "
10250	10258	10107	10107	she	266	" Then I should hold my tongue . "
10259	10304	10124	10124	she	266	" So I do,--about him ; but it is very hard . And then Augusta has a way with me , as though she had a right to order me . I certainly will not be ordered by Augusta . You never ordered me . "
10305	10309	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Dear Ayey ! "
10310	10357	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Augusta is older than you,--of course , ever so much . They make her out twenty - three at her last birthday , but she is twenty - four . But that is not difference enough for ordering,--certainly between cousins . I do hate Augusta . "
10358	10365	10107	10107	she	266	" I would not hate her . "
10366	10432	10124	10124	she	266	" How is one to help one's - self ? She has a way of whispering to Gertrude , and to her mother , when I am there , which almost kills me . ' If you 'll only give me notice I 'll go out of the room at once , ' I said the other day , and they were all so angry . "
10433	10447	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" I would not make them angry if I were you , Ayey . "
10448	10452	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Why not ? "
10453	10462	10107	10107	she	266	" Not Sir Thomas , or Aunt Emmeline . "
10463	10506	10124	10124	she	266	" I do n't care a bit for Sir Thomas . I am not sure but he is the most good - natured , though he is so podgy . Of course , when Aunt Emmeline tells me anything I do it . "
10507	10522	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" It is so important that you should be on good terms with them . "
10523	10532	10534	10534	Ayala	287	" I do n't see it at all , "
10539	10557	10534	10534	Ayala	287	" Aunt Emmeline can do so much for you . We have nothing of our own,--you and I. "
10558	10605	10124	10124	she	266	" Am I to sell myself because they have got money ! No , indeed ! No one despises money so much as I do . I will never be other to them than if I had the money , and they were the poor relations . "
10606	10614	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" That will not do , Ayey . "
10615	10663	10534	10534	Ayala	287	" I will make it do . They may turn me out if they like . Of course , I know that I should obey my aunt , and so I will . If Sir Thomas told me anything I should do it . But not Augusta . "
10690	10697	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" But there is worse still . "
10698	10703	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" What is that ? "
10704	10707	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Tom ! "
10708	10714	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" What does Tom do ? "
10715	10722	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" You know Tom , Lucy ? "
10723	10729	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" I have seen him . "
10730	10740	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" Of all the horrors he is the horridest . "
10741	10748	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Does he order you about ? "
10749	10754	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" No ; but he-- "
10755	10762	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" What is it , Ayey ? "
10763	10774	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" Oh ! Lucy , he is so dreadful . He-- "
10775	10787	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" You do n't mean that he makes love to you ? "
10788	10800	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" He does . What am I to do , Lucy ? "
10801	10807	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" Do they know it ? "
10808	10893	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Augusta does , I 'm sure ; and pretends to think that it is my fault . I am sure that there will be a terrible quarrel some day . I told him the day before we left Glenbogie that I should tell his mother . I did indeed . Then he grinned . He is such a fool . And when I laughed he took it all as kindness . I could n't have helped laughing if I had died for it . "
10894	10902	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" But he has been left behind . "
10903	10930	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" Yes , for the present . But he is to come over to us some time after Christmas , when Uncle Tringle has gone back . "
10931	10947	10685	10685	Ayala	287	" A girl need not be bothered by a lover unless she chooses , Ayey . "
10948	11032	10080	10080	Ayala	287	" But it will be such a bother to have to talk about it . He looks at me , and is such an idiot . Then Augusta frowns . When I see Augusta frowning I am so angry that I feel like boxing her ears . Do you know , Lucy , that I often think that it will not do , and that I shall have to be sent away . I wish it had been you that they had chosen . "
11363	11368	11369	11369	she	302	" Oh , Ayala ! "
11381	11428	11369	11369	she	302	" do struggle ; do bear it . Tell Aunt Emmeline . She will like you to tell her . If Augusta wants you to go anywhere , do go . What does it signify ? Papa and mamma are gone , and we are alone . "
11661	11682	11683	11683	Mangle	308	" As for pictures , I am quite sure that Mangle 's angels would do as well as Raffael 's . "
13594	13605	13606	13607	the mother	758	mother,--"Do not think too much of him till you know , "
13613	13627	13606	13607	the mother	758	" Oh , no ! I will think of him not at all , "
13642	13654	13633	13633	she	266	" I wonder why Mr. Hamel is so different with you ? "
13662	13673	13655	13655	Ayala	287	" I am sure he is not different with me , "
13813	13822	13823	13824	the painter	1161	" You find me crushed to the ground , "
13841	13846	13848	13848	Dormer	266	" Not to me , "
13850	13869	13848	13848	Dormer	266	" It is as though one had lost his eyes . One can not see without his eyes . "
13906	13917	13918	13918	he	310	" I ought not to have intruded on you perhaps , "
13921	13935	13918	13918	he	310	" but after so much kindness I could hardly go without a word . "
13936	13949	13903	13904	the sculptor	1149	" I am sure he will be glad that you have come . "
13950	13954	13903	13904	the sculptor	1149	" And you ? "
13955	13968	13970	13970	she	266	" I am glad too,--so that I may say good - bye . "
14793	14801	14808	14808	Augusta	302	Tom,--"Oh , Tom -- that idiot Tom ! "
14810	14831	14808	14808	Augusta	302	" Augusta is worse than ever . We have not spoken to each other for the last day or two . "
15097	15101	15102	15102	he	310	" Miss Dormer , "
15105	15123	15102	15102	he	310	" I have seen your sister at Rome . May I not say a word about her ? "
15221	15229	15231	15231	Lucy	266	" With my uncle , Mr. Dosett , "
15233	15238	15231	15231	Lucy	266	" at Kingsbury Crescent . "
15279	15290	15291	15291	he	310	" Shall I not see you at all , then ? "
15344	15349	15350	15350	she	266	" Oh , yes , "
15353	15361	15350	15350	she	266	" perhaps we may meet some day . "
15362	15365	15366	15366	he	310	" Here ? "
15369	15383	15350	15350	she	266	" Oh , no ; not here ! It was only an accident . "
15441	15455	15456	15456	he	310	" I have thought of you every day since I have been back , "
15459	15483	15456	15456	he	310	" and I did not know where to hear of you . Now that we have met am I to lose you again ! "
15523	15535	15489	15489	he	310	" Is there no place where I may ask of you ? "
15536	15558	15560	15560	Lucy	266	" When Ayala is back , and they are in town , perhaps I shall sometimes be at Lady Tringle 's , "
15606	15615	15617	15617	Lucy	266	" I think I had better go now , "
15645	15658	15642	15642	he	310	" I hope I have not offended you in coming so far . "
15659	15664	15667	15667	she	266	" Oh , no . "
15777	15785	15786	15786	he	734	" I have got letters from Rome , "
15794	15798	15786	15786	he	734	" From Ayala ? "
15799	15845	15857	15857	he	734	" One from Ayala , for you . It is here . And I have had one from my sister , also ; and one , in the course of the day , from your uncle in Lombard Street . You had better read them ! "
16055	16058	16059	16059	I	0	" ' 64 Leoville,"--which
16593	16598	16575	16575	he	271	" Is that necessary ? "
16612	16631	16633	16634	Sir Thomas	271	" I suppose I ought to do something for a girl if I take her by the hand , "
16638	16657	16633	16634	Sir Thomas	271	" If she gets a husband I will give her something , and that will do as well . "
16715	16717	16707	16707	she	287	" obedient "
16777	16783	16784	16784	Lucy	266	" And to Uncle Thomas , "
16793	16798	16800	16800	Ayala	287	" Oh , yes , "
16901	16907	16908	16908	Ayala	287	" You never ordered me , "
17166	17179	17181	17182	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I really think that Augusta has got something else to do , "
17184	17190	17192	17192	Ayala	287	" Oh , very well , "
17325	17336	17313	17323	a family who ran up and down with the greatest alacrity	1282	" Oh , papa , my basket is out on the seat"--for
17490	17502	17504	17505	Aunt Emmeline	290	" You should not have asked Augusta to go up stairs , "
17514	17522	17524	17524	Ayala	287	" Oh ! I did n't know , "
17526	17552	17524	17524	Ayala	287	" You had meant to say that because she had sent you you were to send her . There is a difference , you know . "
17553	17559	17561	17561	Ayala	287	" I did n't know , "
17583	17628	17524	17524	Ayala	287	" I had meant to tell you before , but I may as well tell you now , Augusta is engaged to be married to the Honourable Mr. Septimus Traffick . He is second son of Lord Boardotrade , and is in the House . "
17629	17633	17635	17635	Ayala	287	" Dear me ! "
17684	17725	17678	17678	her	287	" Yes , indeed . He is a man very much thought of just now in public life , and Augusta 's mind is naturally much occupied . He writes all those letters in The Times about supply and demand . "
17726	17732	17733	17733	Ayala	287	" Does he , aunt ? "
17789	17803	17804	17804	she	287	" If anybody had told me before I would n't have asked her , "
18173	18194	18198	18198	herself	287	" To sit out on the bank of a stream and have him beside one would not be particularly nice , "
18301	18312	18313	18313	she	287	" I suppose you had not heard of him before ? "
18318	18323	18313	18313	she	287	" I never did . "
18324	18336	18313	18313	she	287	" That 's because you have not attended to the debates . "
18337	18346	18313	18313	she	287	" I never have . What are debates ? "
18347	18366	18313	18313	she	287	" Mr. Traffick is very much thought of in the House of Commons on all subjects affecting commerce . "
18367	18370	18313	18313	she	287	" Oh ! "
18371	18383	18313	18313	she	287	" It is the most glorious study which the world affords . "
18384	18401	18403	18403	Augusta	302	" The House of Commons . I do n't think it can be equal to art . "
18445	18457	18458	18458	she	302	" Mr. Traffick will probably be in the government some day , "
18461	18468	18470	18470	Ayala	287	" Has not he been yet ? "
18472	18476	18470	18470	Ayala	287	" Not yet . "
18477	18490	18532	18532	They	1314	" Then wo n't he be very old before he gets there ? "
18548	18578	18543	18543	they	1314	" Of course , Mr. Walker is old enough to be my father , but I have made up my mind that I like that better than anything else . "
18646	18649	18625	18626	Augusta Tringle	302	" less than forty,"--though
18731	18741	18743	18743	Augusta	302	" Lord Boardotrade was much older when he began , "
18745	18788	18743	18743	Augusta	302	" His friends , indeed , tell Septimus that he should not push himself forward too quickly . But I do n't think that I ever came across any one who was so ignorant of such things as you are , Ayala . "
18789	18800	18802	18802	Ayala	287	" Perhaps he is not so old as he looks , "
19256	19275	19276	19276	she	287	" If you make yourself such a fool , Tom , I 'll never speak to you again , "
19415	19436	19437	19437	she	287	" I tell you I do n't care a bit about you , and you ought n't to go on , "
19467	19470	19471	19471	she	302	" Ayala , "
19474	19481	19471	19471	she	302	" you should not encourage Tom . "
19564	19569	19570	19570	she	302	" Oh , Augusta , "
19577	19585	19570	19570	she	302	" what a spiteful creature you are . "
19586	19601	19570	19570	she	302	" I suppose you think so , because I do not choose to approve . "
19602	19641	19647	19647	she	287	" Approve of what ! Tom is thoroughly disagreeable . Sometimes he makes my life such a burden to me that I think I shall have to go to my aunt . But you are worse . Oh ! "
20033	20042	20043	20043	she	302	" Do n't let her go , mamma , "
20051	20063	20043	20043	she	302	" But the Marchesa has made such a point of it . "
20064	20102	20043	20043	she	302	" Bother the Marchesa ! Who is the Marchesa ? I believe it is all Ayala 's doing because she expects to meet that Mr. Hamel . It is dreadful to see the way she goes on . "
20103	20116	20043	20043	she	302	" Mr. Hamel was a very intimate friend of her father 's . "
20117	20127	20043	20043	she	302	" I do n't believe a bit of it . "
20128	20143	20043	20043	she	302	" He certainly used to be at his house . I remember seeing him . "
20144	20176	20043	20043	she	302	" I daresay ; but that does n't justify Ayala in running after him as she does . I believe that all this about the Marchesa is because of Mr. Hamel . "
20389	20393	20374	20375	Lady Tringle	282	" au première , "
21166	21180	21181	21181	Augusta	302	" I really think you were too free with Mr. Traffick last night , "
21188	21194	21181	21181	Augusta	302	" Free ! How free ? "
21195	21203	21213	21213	Ayala	287	" You were -- laughing at him . "
21204	21211	21213	21213	Ayala	287	" Oh , he likes that , "
21215	21246	21213	21213	Ayala	287	" All that time we were up at the top of St. Peter 's I was quizzing him about his speeches . He lets me say just what I please . "
21408	21419	21421	21421	Augusta	302	" I suppose he takes you to be a child , "
21423	21436	21421	21421	Augusta	302	" but if you are a child you ought to conduct yourself . "
21437	21446	21448	21448	Ayala	287	" I suppose he does perceive the difference , "
21512	21526	21528	21528	Augusta	302	" You are the most impertinent person I ever knew in my life , "
21707	21710	21711	21711	she	302	" Septimus , "
21714	21728	21711	21711	she	302	" I would rather you would not go to that woman 's party . "
21754	21761	21745	21745	his	321	" Why , my own one ? "
21762	21772	21711	21711	she	302	" She has not treated mamma well,--nor yet me . "
21773	21778	21745	21745	his	321	" Ayala is going . "
21792	21820	21789	21789	Augusta	302	" My cousin is behaving badly in the matter , and mamma ought not to allow her to go . Who knows anything about the Marchesa Baldoni ? "
21821	21835	21837	21838	Mr. Traffick	321	" Both he and she are of the very best families in Rome , "
21846	21898	21837	21838	Mr. Traffick	321	" At any rate they are behaving very badly to us , and I will take it as a favour that you do not go . Asking Ayala , and then asking you , as good as from the same house , is too marked . You ought not to go . "
21943	21967	21969	21969	he	321	" Dear Augusta , it is right that I should go there , if it be only for half - an - hour . "
22121	22138	22104	22104	She	287	" Oh , dear , yes , I dare say there were two hundred people there . "
22139	22149	22151	22151	Augusta	302	" That is what she calls a little dance , "
22156	22169	22171	22171	Ayala	287	" I suppose that is the Italian way of talking about it , "
22173	22182	22171	22171	Ayala	287	" Italian way ! I hate Italian ways . "
22183	22210	22211	22211	Augusta	302	" Mr. Traffick liked it very much . I 'm sure he 'll tell you so . I had no idea he would care to dance . "
22237	22249	22221	22222	Lady Tringle	282	" Why should not Mr. Traffick dance like any other gentleman ? "
22250	22297	22300	22300	he	1425	" Oh , I do n't know . I thought that a man who makes so many speeches in Parliament would think of something else . I was very glad he did , for he danced three times with me . He can waltz as lightly as-- "
22316	22327	22329	22329	Augusta	302	" He is the best dancer I ever danced with , "
22331	22339	22341	22341	Ayala	287	" But you almost never do dance , "
22343	22356	22358	22358	Augusta	302	" I suppose I may know about it as well as another , "
22493	22499	22501	22502	some people	1431	" she had it out , "
22509	22528	22529	22529	she	1430	" If I am to be treated in this way you had better tell me so at once , "
22532	22542	22544	22545	Mr. Traffick	333	" I know no better way of treating you , "
22547	22578	22544	22545	Mr. Traffick	333	" Dancing with that chit all night , turning her head , and then walking with her all the next day ! I will not put up with such conduct . "
22623	22628	22629	22629	he	333	" My own one , "
22632	22642	22629	22629	he	333	" you are really making an ass of yourself . "
22643	22665	22629	22629	he	333	" Very well ! Then I will write to papa , and let him know that it must be all over . "
22865	22870	22872	22872	Augusta	302	" Bid him go , "
22874	22883	22872	22872	Augusta	302	" I never want to behold him again . "
23001	23008	23010	23011	Lady Tringle	282	" Perhaps she gives herself airs , "
23013	23021	23010	23011	Lady Tringle	282	" but really it is no more . "
23022	23028	23030	23030	Augusta	302	" She is a viper , "
23055	23060	23062	23062	Gertrude	404	" The truth is , "
23064	23082	23083	23083	Gertrude	404	" that Ayala thinks herself very clever and very beautiful , and Augusta will not stand it . "
24132	24144	24145	24146	his sister	1485	" Oh , Tom , I never saw anything so stunning , "
24307	24315	24316	24316	she	287	" What is the matter , Augusta , "
24320	24330	24316	24316	she	287	" that you are determined to quarrel with me ? "
24343	24350	24352	24352	Augusta	302	" I have quarrelled with you , "
24354	24365	24352	24352	Augusta	302	" because you do not know how to behave yourself . "
24400	24415	24417	24417	Ayala	287	" Only that you are going away I would not consent to live here , "
24455	24478	24439	24439	Ayala	287	" If I could not live I could die . Anything would be better than to be treated as she treats me . "
24731	24739	24740	24740	he	271	" I think you are quite right , "
24764	24769	24740	24740	he	271	" Right about what ? "
24770	24798	24740	24740	he	271	" In not giving up to Augusta . She was always like that when she was a child , and now her head is turned about Traffick . "
24799	24815	24740	24740	he	271	" I should n't grudge her her lover if she would only let me alone . "
24816	24826	24740	24740	he	271	" I do n't suppose she hurts you much ? "
24827	24847	24740	24740	he	271	" She sets my aunt against me , and that makes me unhappy . Of course I am wretched . "
24848	24858	24740	24740	he	271	" Oh , Ayala , do n't be wretched . "
24859	24887	24740	24740	he	271	" How is one to help it ? I never said an ill - natured word to her , and now I am so lonely among them ! "
24949	24957	24959	24959	he	743	" I shall always take your part , "
24961	24971	24959	24959	he	743	" I do n't want any taking of parts . "
24972	25000	25002	25002	he	743	" But I shall . I am not going to see you put upon . You are more to me , Ayala , than any of them . "
25170	25184	25185	25185	she	329	" It wo n't do for you to separate yourself from your aunt , "
25189	25209	25185	25185	she	329	" Of course we shall be friends , and at some future time you shall come and see us . "
25468	25471	25472	25472	he	271	" Ayala , "
25475	25482	25472	25472	he	271	" all this must be altered . "
25483	25489	25440	25440	Ayala	287	" What must be altered ? "
25490	25505	25442	25442	Tom	271	" If you only knew , Ayala , how much you are to me . "
25506	25527	25472	25472	he	271	" I wish you would n't , Tom . I do n't want to be anything to anybody in particular . "
25528	25565	25440	25440	Ayala	287	" What I mean is , that I wo n't have them sit upon you . They treat you as -- as,--well , as though you had only half a right to be one of them . "
25566	25579	25442	25442	Tom	271	" No more I have . I have no right at all . "
25580	25598	25472	25472	he	271	" But that 's not the way I want it to be . If you were my wife-- "
25599	25606	25440	25440	Ayala	287	" Tom , pray do n't . "
25607	25640	25442	25442	Tom	271	" Why not ? I 'm in earnest . Why ai n't I to speak as I think ? Oh , Ayala , if you knew how much I think of you . "
25641	25654	25472	25472	he	271	" But you should n't . You have n't got a right . "
25655	25662	25440	25440	Ayala	287	" I have got a right . "
25663	25680	25681	25681	He	1520	" But I do n't want it , Tom , and I wo n't have it . "
25789	25796	25797	25797	she	1521	" I want to get out , "
25800	25809	25797	25797	she	1521	" I wo n't stay here any more . "
25828	25846	25848	25848	Tom	271	" Do n't you believe me when I tell you that I love you better than anybody ? "
25850	25853	25848	25848	Tom	271	" No . "
25854	25863	25797	25797	she	1521	" Not believe me ? Oh , Ayala ! "
25864	25890	25848	25848	Tom	271	" I do n't want to believe anything . I want to get out . If you go on , I 'll tell my aunt . "
26026	26034	26035	26035	he	271	" You may tell all the world , "
26039	26050	26035	26035	he	271	" All I want is that you should love me . "
26051	26072	26035	26035	he	271	" But I do n't . There are Gertrude and Mr. Houston , and I want to go to them . "
26073	26083	26035	26035	he	271	" Say one nice word to me , Ayala . "
26084	26110	26035	26035	he	271	" I do n't know how to say a nice word . Ca n't you be made to understand that I do n't like it ? "
26111	26114	26035	26035	he	271	" Ayala . "
26115	26125	26035	26035	he	271	" Why do n't you let me go away ? "
26126	26134	26035	26035	he	271	" Ayala,--give me -- one -- kiss . "
26184	26193	26195	26195	Tom	271	" Ayala , I am quite in earnest , "
26203	26213	26195	26195	Tom	271	" and I mean to go on with it . "
26577	26581	26575	26575	he	345	" meant nothing . "
26969	26973	26960	26960	She	287	" Dear Tom , "
27219	27230	27212	27212	she	287	" Go away , Tom , you fool , you , "
27306	27318	27303	27304	THE LOUT	1573	" Aunt Emmeline , I want you to read this letter . "
27720	27729	27730	27730	she	287	" How long has this been going on ? "
27735	27752	27754	27754	Ayala	287	" He used to tease me at Glenbogie , and now he is doing it again , "
27756	27772	27754	27754	Ayala	287	" There must certainly be put an end to it . You must go away . "
27792	27820	27778	27779	her aunt	737	" Of course there must be put an end to it , Aunt Emmeline . He has no right to annoy me when I tell him not . "
27821	27829	27778	27779	her aunt	737	" I suppose you have encouraged him . "
27874	27876	27904	27904	she	737	" encouraged "
27897	27903	27904	27904	she	737	" He is a lout , "
27907	27912	27904	27904	she	737	" a stupid lout ! "
27936	27947	27915	27915	her	737	" I have not encouraged him . It is untrue . "
27948	27956	27904	27904	she	737	" Ayala , you are very impertinent . "
27957	27993	27915	27915	her	737	" And you are very unjust . Because I want to put a stop to it I come to you , and you tell me that I encourage him . You are worse than Augusta . "
28076	28083	28062	28062	she	902	" You are worse than Augusta ! "
28142	28156	28157	28157	she	902	" How dare you speak to me like that , ' Miss ' ? "
28160	28242	28157	28157	she	902	" So you are . It is very cruel . Tom will go on saying all this nonsense to me , and when I come to you you say I encourage him ! I never encouraged him . I despise him too much . I did not think my own aunt could have told me that I encouraged any man . No , I did n't . You drive me to it , so that I have got to be impertinent . "
28243	28252	28254	28255	the aunt	1448	" You had better go to your room , "
28275	28285	28261	28261	her	287	" You had better leave that letter with me . "
28617	28619	28628	28628	he	1588	" lout "
28776	28781	28772	28772	he	271	" bo to a goose "
28876	28878	28879	28879	he	271	" lout "
28883	28899	28900	28900	he	271	" She 'll come to think different from that before she 's done with me , "
29005	29015	29016	29016	she	287	" Why did she say that I encouraged him ? "
29022	29032	29034	29034	Gertrude	404	" I do n't think she did encourage him , "
29414	29435	29437	29438	Sir Thomas	271	" If she likes to change with her sister Lucy , and you like it , I shall not object , "
29597	29612	29613	29613	he	271	" You 'll think very different from that some of these days , Ayala , "
29619	29633	29613	29613	he	271	" No , I sha n't ; I shall think always the same . "
29634	29648	29592	29592	she	287	" When you know how much I love you , you 'll change . "
29649	29659	29660	29660	she	287	" I do n't want you to love me , "
29663	29713	29660	29660	she	287	" and if you were anything that is good you would n't go on after I have told you so often . It is not manly of you . You have brought me to all manner of trouble . It is your fault , but they make me suffer . "
29778	29786	29787	29787	Ayala	287	" As for that , Aunt Emmeline , "
29790	29811	29787	29787	Ayala	287	" you may be quite sure that I shall never encourage him . I shall never like him well enough . "
29812	29846	29877	29878	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Very well . Then we need say no more about that , my dear . Of course , it must be unpleasant to us all , being in the same house together . "
29847	29875	29787	29787	Ayala	287	" It is very unpleasant to me , when he will go on bothering me like that . It makes me wish that I were anywhere else . "
30011	30024	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" If you think so , perhaps some arrangement can be made , "
30032	30036	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" What arrangement ? "
30037	30050	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" You must not suppose that I wish to turn you out ? "
30051	30056	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" But what arrangement ? "
30057	30079	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" You see , Ayala , that unfortunately we have not all of us hit it off nicely ; have we ? "
30080	30104	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Not at all , Aunt Emmeline . Augusta is always angry with me . And you,--you think that I have encouraged Tom . "
30105	30115	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I am saying nothing about that , Ayala . "
30116	30126	30026	30027	Aunt Emmeline	290	" But what arrangement is it , Aunt Emmeline ? "
30329	30331	30301	30302	the Tringles	282	" arrangement "
30425	30431	30432	30432	she	287	" What arrangement , aunt ? "
30458	30485	30487	30487	she	737	" Of course , dear Ayala , we do not wish to do less than we at first intended . But as you are not happy here-- "
30495	30502	30504	30504	Ayala	287	" I am not happy here , "
30508	30520	30504	30504	Ayala	287	" How would it be if you were to change,--with Lucy ? "
30600	30609	30611	30611	Ayala	287	" I should be very glad , indeed , "
30658	30664	30645	30645	she	737	lips,--"I should be very glad , indeed,"--Ayala
30707	30715	30717	30718	Lady Tringle	282	" Then perhaps it can be arranged , "
30720	30740	30717	30718	Lady Tringle	282	" I do n't know what Uncle Dosett may say . Perhaps they are very fond of Lucy now . "
30741	30756	30717	30718	Lady Tringle	282	" They would n't wish to stand in her way , I should think . "
30757	30798	30717	30718	Lady Tringle	282	" At any rate , I wo n't . If you , and my uncles , and Aunt Margaret , will consent , I will go whenever you choose . Of course I must do just as I 'm told . "
33387	33390	33392	33393	Aunt Dosett	1762	" Lucy , "
33395	33403	33392	33393	Aunt Dosett	1762	" this is a very serious proposal . "
33404	33408	33410	33410	Lucy	266	" Very serious , "
33414	33431	33410	33410	Lucy	266	" I have not read the letters , but your uncle has told me about it . "
33460	33469	33471	33472	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Your Aunt Emmeline is certainly in earnest , "
33474	33499	33471	33472	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Aunt Emmeline is very good - natured , and perhaps she will change her mind if we tell her that we wish it . "
33500	33509	33571	33572	Aunt Dosett	1764	" But Sir Thomas has agreed to it . "
33510	33556	33471	33472	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I am sure my uncle will give way if Aunt Emmeline will ask him . He says he has no complaint to make against Ayala . I think it is Augusta , and Augusta will be married , and will go away very soon . "
33689	33694	33695	33695	she	285	" But , Lucy , "
33710	33713	33715	33715	Lucy	266	" Ayala-- , "
33719	33734	33715	33715	Lucy	266	" I will be kind to her,--perhaps kinder than I have been to you . "
33735	33771	33695	33695	she	285	" You have been kind , and I have been ungrateful . I know it . But I will do better now , Aunt Dosett . I will stay , if you will have me . "
33772	33789	33715	33715	Lucy	266	" They are rich and powerful , and you will have to do as they direct . "
33790	33817	33715	33715	Lucy	266	" No ! Who are they that I should be made to come and go at their bidding ? They can not make me leave you . "
33818	33838	33695	33695	she	285	" But they can rid themselves of Ayala . You see what your uncle says about money for Ayala . "
33839	33844	33715	33715	Lucy	266	" I hate money . "
33845	33929	33695	33695	she	285	" Money is a thing which none of us can afford to hate . Do you think it will not be much to your Uncle Reginald to know that you are both provided for ? Already he is wretched because there will be nothing to come to you . If you go to your Aunt Emmeline , Sir Thomas will do for you as he has done for Ayala . Dear Lucy , it is not that I want to send you away . "
33945	34004	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" But it had better be as is proposed , if your aunt still wishes it , when she comes home . I and your Uncle Reginald would not do right were we to allow you to throw away the prospects that are offered you . It is natural that Lady Tringle should be anxious about her son . "
34005	34014	34016	34016	Lucy	266	" She need not , in the least , "
34020	34028	34016	34016	Lucy	266	" But you see what they say . "
34029	34044	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" It is his fault , not hers . Why should she be punished ? "
34045	34087	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" Because he is Fortune 's favourite , and she is not . It is no good kicking against the pricks , my dear . He is his father 's son and heir , and everything must give way to him . "
34088	34148	34016	34016	Lucy	266	" But Ayala does not want him . Ayala despises him . It is too hard that she is to lose everything because a young man like that will go on making himself disagreeable . They have no right to do it after having accustomed Ayala to such a home . Do n't you feel that , Aunt Dosett ? "
34149	34155	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" I do feel it . "
34156	34210	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" However it might have been arranged at first , it ought to remain now . Even though Ayala and I are only girls , we ought not to be changed about as though we were horses . If she had done anything wrong,--but Uncle Tom says that she has done nothing wrong . "
34211	34222	34016	34016	Lucy	266	" I suppose she has spoken to her aunt disrespectfully . "
34223	34269	33935	33935	Lucy	266	" Because her aunt told her that she had encouraged this man . What would you have a girl say when she is falsely accused like that ? Would you say it to me merely because some horrid man would come and speak to me ? "
34672	34685	34686	34686	she	287	" I suppose I had better go to - morrow , aunt ? "
34700	34714	34686	34686	she	287	" In a day or two , Ayala , it will be better . "
34715	34734	34686	34686	she	287	" It shall be Monday , then . You must come over here in a cab , Lucy . "
34735	34745	34686	34686	she	287	" The carriage shall be sent , my dear . "
34746	34759	34686	34686	she	287	" But then it must go back with me , Aunt Emmeline . "
34760	34767	34686	34686	she	287	" It shall , my dear . "
34768	34790	34686	34686	she	287	" And the horses must be put up , because Lucy and I must change all our things in the drawers . "
35148	35154	35155	35155	she	287	" Of course I know , "
35158	35171	35155	35155	she	287	" What is the use of telling stories about it any longer ? "
35172	35196	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" It is not too late yet , Ayala . If we both go to Uncle Tom he will let us change it . "
35197	35245	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" Why should it be changed ? If I could change it by lifting up my little finger I could not do it . Why should it not be you as well as me ? They have tried me , and,--as Aunt Emmeline says,--I have not suited . "
35246	35258	35155	35155	she	287	" Aunt Dosett is not ill - natured , my darling . "
35259	35337	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" No , I dare say not . It is I that am bad . It is bad to like pretty things and money , and to hate poor things . Or , rather , I do not believe it is bad at all , because it is so natural . I believe it is all a lie as to its being wicked to love riches . I love them , whether it is wicked or not . "
35338	35343	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" Oh , Ayala ! "
35344	35377	35378	35378	Lucy	266	" Do not you ? Do n't let us be hypocritical , Lucy , now at the last moment . Did you like the way in which they lived in Kingsbury Crescent ? "
35384	35393	35394	35394	she	266	" I like it better than I did , "
35397	35411	35394	35394	she	266	" At any rate , I would willingly go back to Kingsbury Crescent . "
35412	35417	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" Yes,--for my sake . "
35418	35426	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" Indeed I would , my pet . "
35427	35525	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" And for your sake I would rather die than stay . But what is the good of talking about it , Lucy . You and I have no voice in it , though it is all about ourselves . As you say , we are like two tame birds , who have to be moved from one cage into another just as the owner pleases . We belong either to Uncle Tom or Uncle Dosett , just as they like to settle it . Oh , Lucy , I do so wish that I were dead . "
35526	35533	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" Ayala , that is wicked . "
35534	35579	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" How can I help it , if I am wicked ? What am I to do when I get there ? What am I to say to them ? How am I to live ? Lucy , we shall never see each other . "
35580	35589	35126	35126	Ayala	287	" I will come across to you constantly . "
35590	35620	35621	35621	Lucy	266	" I meant to do so , but I did n't . They are two worlds , miles asunder . Lucy , will they let Isadore Hamel come here ? "
35626	35634	35621	35621	Lucy	266	" I am sure he will come . "
35679	35689	35690	35690	she	266	" It will make no difference if he does , "
35693	35728	35690	35690	she	266	" Oh , I have such a dream,--such a castle - in - the - air ! If I could think it might ever be so , then I should not want to die . "
35729	35735	35690	35690	she	266	" What do you dream ? "
35749	35772	35740	35740	she	266	" If you had a little house of your own , oh , ever so tiny ; and if you and he-- ? "
35773	35779	35690	35690	she	266	" There is no he . "
35780	35821	35690	35690	she	266	" There might be . And , if you and he would let me have any corner for myself , then I should be happy . Then I would not want to die . You would , would n't you ? "
35822	35863	35690	35690	she	266	" How can I talk about it , Ayala ? There is n't such a thing . But yet,--but yet ; oh , Ayala , do you not know that to have you with me would be better than anything ? "
35864	35891	35690	35690	she	266	" No;--not better than anything;--second best . He would be best . I do so hope that he may be ' he . ' Come in . "
35910	35959	35904	35904	herself	290	" Now , my dears , the horses are standing there , and the men are coming up for the luggage . Ayala , I hope we shall see you very often . And remember that , as regards anything that is unpleasant , bygones shall be bygones . "
36117	36130	36131	36131	he	294	" I do n't mean to give you up , you know , "
36137	36181	36131	36131	he	294	" When I say a thing I mean it . I am not going to be put off by my mother . And as for the governor he would not say a word against it if he thought we were both in earnest . "
36182	36190	36192	36192	Ayala	287	" But I ai n't in earnest , "
36194	36205	36131	36131	he	294	" or rather , I am very much in earnest . "
36206	36222	36131	36131	he	294	" So am I. That 's all I 've got to say just at present . "
36236	36239	36131	36131	he	294	" lout , "
36798	36802	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" My dear , "
36807	36821	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" we will do all that we can to make you happy here . "
36822	36842	36869	36869	Ayala	287	" I am sure you will ; but -- but -- it is so sad coming away from Lucy . "
36843	36855	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" Lucy I am sure will be happy with her cousins . "
36878	36889	36869	36869	Ayala	287	" And my sister Emmeline is always good - natured . "
36890	36898	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" Aunt Emmeline is very good , only-- "
36899	36903	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" Only what ? "
36904	36921	36869	36869	Ayala	287	" I do n't know . But it is such a sudden change , Uncle Reginald . "
36922	36971	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" Yes , it is a very great change , my dear . They are very rich and we are poor enough . I should hardly have consented to this , for your sake , but that there are reasons which will make it better for you both . "
36972	36977	36979	36979	Ayala	287	" As to that , "
36983	36995	36979	36979	Ayala	287	" I had to come away . I did n't suit . "
36996	37005	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" You shall suit us , my dear . "
37006	37034	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" I hope so . I will try . I know more now than I did then . I thought I was to be Augusta 's equal . "
37035	37043	36979	36979	Ayala	287	" We shall all be equal here . "
37044	37088	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" People ought to be equal , I think,--except old people and young people . I will do whatever you and my aunt tell me . There are no young people here , so there wo n't be any trouble of that kind . "
37089	37110	36804	36805	the uncle	1830	" There will be no other young person , certainly . You shall go upstairs now and see your aunt . "
37894	37898	37900	37901	that lady	1854	" My dear , "
37903	37911	37900	37901	that lady	1854	" I hope you will be happy . "
37912	37920	37922	37922	Ayala	287	" I am determined to be happy , "
37924	37933	37922	37922	Ayala	287	" if you will let me love you . "
38074	38083	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" What would you like me to do ? "
38099	38112	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" To do , my dear ? What do you generally do ? "
38113	38139	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" Nothing . I read a little and draw a little , but I do nothing useful . I mean it to be different now . "
38140	38150	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" You shall do as you please , Ayala . "
38151	38173	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" Oh , but I mean it . And you must tell me . Of course things have to be different . "
38174	38186	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" We are not rich like your uncle and aunt Tringle . "
38187	38221	38085	38085	Ayala	287	" Perhaps it is better not to be rich , so that one may have something to do . But I want you to tell me as though you really cared for me . "
38222	38229	38231	38232	Aunt Dosett	1862	" I will care for you , "
38236	38304	38231	38232	Aunt Dosett	1862	" Then first begin by telling me what to do . I will try and do it . Of course I have thought about it , coming away from all manner of rich things ; and I have determined that it shall not make me unhappy . I will rise above it . I will begin to - morrow and do anything if you will tell me . "
38338	38348	38350	38351	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I think she will do better than Lucy , "
38358	38366	38368	38369	Uncle Reginald	292	" Lucy was a dear girl too , "
38371	38405	38368	38369	Uncle Reginald	292	" Oh , yes;--quite so . I do n't mean to say a word against Lucy ; but I think that I can do better with Ayala . She will be more diligent . "
39253	39274	39276	39276	Tom	271	" I want to say a word or two , Sir , about -- about the little affair of mine , "
39278	39282	39284	39285	Sir Thomas	271	" What affair ? "
39293	39303	39284	39285	Sir Thomas	271	" I think I should like to -- marry . "
39304	39326	39284	39285	Sir Thomas	271	" The best thing you can do , my boy ; only it depends upon who the young lady may be . "
39327	39360	39284	39285	Sir Thomas	271	" My mind is made up about that , Sir ; I mean to marry my cousin . I do n't see why a young man is n't to choose for himself . "
39520	39532	39533	39533	he	271	" I find my boy is quite in earnest about this , "
39540	39545	39533	39533	he	271	" Oh ; indeed . "
39546	39557	39558	39559	Mr. Dosett	270	" I ca n't say I quite like it myself . "
39566	39577	39563	39563	his	270	" Cousins had better be cousins , and nothing more . "
39578	39590	39533	39533	he	271	" And then you would probably expect him to get money ? "
39591	39596	39598	39599	Sir Thomas	271	" Not at all , "
39603	39694	39598	39599	Sir Thomas	271	" I have got money enough for them both . It is n't an affair of money . To make a long story short , I have given my consent ; and , therefore , if you do not mind , I shall be glad if you will allow Tom to call at the Crescent . Of course , you may have your own views ; but I do n't suppose you can hope to do better for the girl . Cousins do marry , you know , very often . "
39803	39807	39809	39810	Aunt Margaret	285	" My dear , "
39823	39835	39818	39818	her	285	" your Cousin Tom is to be allowed to call here . "
39836	39840	39818	39818	her	285	" Tom Tringle ? "
39841	39852	39818	39818	her	285	" Yes , my dear . Sir Thomas has consented . "
39853	39860	39862	39862	Ayala	287	" Then he had better not , "
39870	39893	39862	39862	Ayala	287	" Uncle Tom has got nothing to do with it , either in refusing or consenting . I wo n't see him . "
39894	39905	39818	39818	her	285	" I think you must see him if he calls . "
39906	39946	39818	39818	her	285	" But I do n't want . Oh , Aunt Margaret , pray make him not come . I do n't like him a bit . We are doing so very well . Are we not , Aunt Margaret ? "
39947	39980	39862	39862	Ayala	287	" Certainly , my dear , we are doing very well;--at least , I hope so . But you are old enough now to understand that this is a very serious matter . "
39981	39988	39990	39990	Ayala	287	" Of course it is serious , "
40150	40198	40138	40138	she	287	" I think you ought to see him when he comes , and to remember how different it will be when he comes with the approval of his father . It is , of course , saying that they are ready to welcome you as their daughter . "
40199	40210	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" I do n't want to be anybody 's daughter . "
40211	40245	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" But , Ayala , there are so many things to be thought of . Here is a young man who is able to give you not only every comfort but great opulence . "
40246	40255	40138	40138	she	287	" I do n't want to be opulent . "
40256	40264	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" And he will be a baronet . "
40265	40276	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" I do n't care about baronets , Aunt Margaret . "
40277	40298	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" And you will have a house of your own in which you may be of service to your sister . "
40299	40309	40138	40138	she	287	" I had rather she should have a house . "
40310	40320	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" But Tom is not in love with Lucy . "
40321	40402	40420	40420	Ayala	287	" He is such a lout ! Aunt Margaret , I wo n't have anything to say to him . I would a great deal sooner die . Uncle Tom has no right to send him here . They have got rid of me , and I am very glad of it ; but it is n't fair that he should come after me now that I 'm gone away . Could n't Uncle Reginald tell him to stay away ? "
40960	40967	40968	40968	Ayala	287	" What can be the good ? "
40984	41000	40968	40968	Ayala	287	" as I can tell him everything just as well without his coming at all . "
41502	41505	41506	41506	he	271	" Ayala ! "
41521	41524	41525	41525	she	287	" Tom ! "
41535	41549	41525	41525	she	287	" Ayala , I love you better than anything else in the world . "
41550	41559	41506	41506	he	271	" But what 's the good of it ? "
41560	41607	41525	41525	she	287	" Of course it was different when I told you so before . I meant to stick to it , and I was determined that the governor should give way . But you could n't know that . Mother and the girls were all against us . "
41608	41615	41617	41617	Ayala	287	" They were n't against me , "
41619	41694	41617	41617	Ayala	287	" They were against our being married , and so they squeezed you out as it were . That is why you have been sent to this place . But they understand me now , and know what I am about . They have all given their consent , and the governor has promised to be liberal . When he says a thing he 'll do it . There will be lots of money . "
41695	41705	41707	41707	Ayala	287	" I do n't care a bit about money , "
41711	41732	41707	41707	Ayala	287	" No more do I,--except only that it is comfortable . It would n't do to marry without money,--would it ? "
41733	41745	41746	41749	The angel of light	1952	" It would do very well if anybody cared for anybody . "
41752	41757	41617	41617	Ayala	287	" in formâ pauperis , "
41783	41802	41617	41617	Ayala	287	" But an income is a good thing , and the governor will come down like a brick . "
41803	41844	41707	41707	Ayala	287	" The governor has nothing to do with it . I told you before that it is all nonsense . If you will only go away and say nothing about it I shall always think you very good - natured . "
41845	41853	41855	41855	Tom	353	" But I wo n't go away , "
41860	41883	41855	41855	Tom	353	" I mean to stick to it . Ayala , I do n't believe you understand that I am thoroughly in earnest . "
41884	41895	41707	41707	Ayala	287	" Why should n't I be in earnest , too ? "
41896	41932	41707	41707	Ayala	287	" But I love you , Ayala . I have set my heart upon it . You do n't know how well I love you . I have quite made up my mind about it . "
41933	41942	41855	41855	Tom	353	" And I have made up my mind . "
41943	41946	41951	41951	his	353	" But Ayala-- "
41980	41993	41961	41963	a despairing lover	1956	" I do n't suppose you care for any other fellow yet . "
42096	42105	42106	42106	she	1958	" That has nothing to do with it , "
42109	42118	42106	42106	she	1958	" If you knew how I love you ! "
42140	42189	42131	42131	he	353	" Do n't be a fool , Tom,--pray do n't . If you wo n't get up I shall go away . I must go away . I have heard all that there is to hear . I told them that there is no use in your coming . "
42190	42193	42106	42106	she	1958	" Ayala ! "
42201	42217	42131	42131	he	353	" Then why do n't you give it up and let us be good friends . "
42218	42272	42131	42131	he	353	" I ca n't give it up . I wo n't give it up . When a fellow means it as I do he never gives it up . Nothing on earth shall make me give it up . Ayala , you 've got to do it , and so I tell you . "
42273	42279	42281	42281	Ayala	287	" Nobody can make me , "
42299	42311	42284	42284	her	287	" Then you wo n't say one kind word to me ? "
42312	42320	42131	42131	he	353	" I ca n't say anything kinder . "
42321	42365	42284	42284	her	287	" Very well . Then I shall go away and come again constantly till you do . I mean to have you . When you come to know how very much I love you I do think you will give way at last . "
42389	42393	42131	42131	he	353	" WOULD YOU ? "
42803	42808	42810	42810	Lucy	266	" They quite understand , "
42812	42825	42810	42810	Lucy	266	" that it will not do to have you and Augusta together . "
42835	42849	42853	42853	herself	287	" It wo n't at all do to have me and him together , "
43549	43569	43540	43540	Ayala	287	" It 's a great shame , and you have no right to treat me in this , way . "
43703	43713	43714	43714	he	271	" Augusta does n't hit it off with her , "
43730	43767	43714	43714	he	271	wedding,--"Augusta is the biggest fool out , you know . She 's proud of her husband because he 's the son of a lord . I would n't change Ayala for the daughter of any duchess in Europe;"--thus
44110	44115	44092	44092	Augusta	302	" dear Merle Park . "
44209	44221	44223	44224	Lady Tringle	282	" Is it necessary that she should come quite at present ? "
44226	44234	44236	44237	Sir Thomas	271	" I thought it was all settled , "
44291	44302	44303	44303	he	271	" I suppose we might as well have Ayala now , "
44312	44322	44303	44303	he	271	" Do you go and manage it with her . "
44421	44428	44429	44429	she	282	" Of course , my dear , "
44432	44440	44429	44429	she	282	" if we could make dear Ayala happy-- "
44441	44453	44399	44399	he	271	" I do n't think she will come , Aunt Emmeline . "
44454	44458	44429	44429	she	282	" Not come ! "
44481	44489	44429	44429	she	282	" She 's afraid of -- Tom . "
44583	44588	44590	44591	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Afraid of him ? "
44593	44634	44590	44591	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I mean that she is not a bit in love with him , and when a girl is like that I suppose she is -- is afraid of a man , if everybody else wants her to marry him . "
44635	44645	44647	44648	Lady Tringle	282	" Why should everybody want her to marry Tom ? "
44652	44662	44647	44648	Lady Tringle	282	" I am sure I do n't want her . "
44663	44679	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" I suppose it is Uncle Tom , and Aunt Dosett , and Uncle Reginald , "
44692	44743	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" I do n't see why anybody should want her to marry Tom . Tom is carried away by her baby face , and makes a fool of himself . As to everybody wanting her , I hope she does not flatter herself that there is anything of the kind . "
44744	44768	44647	44648	Lady Tringle	282	" I only meant that I think she would rather not be brought here , where she would have to see him daily . "
44793	44799	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" Has he been there ? "
44809	44816	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" What he do you mean ? "
44817	44821	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" Isadore Hamel . "
44822	44856	44647	44648	Lady Tringle	282	" No ; I have not seen him since I met him in the Park . But I do not want to talk about Mr. Hamel , Ayala . Mr. Hamel is nothing . "
44857	44862	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" Oh , Lucy . "
44863	44891	44681	44682	poor Lucy	266	" He is nothing . Had he been anything , he has gone , and there would be an end to it . But he is nothing . "
44892	44908	44647	44648	Lady Tringle	282	" If a man is true he may go , but he will come back . "
45052	45077	45037	45037	he	310	" Never mind about Mr. Hamel , Ayala . It is not nice to talk about a man who has never spoken a word . "
45078	45088	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Never spoken a word ! Oh , Lucy ! "
45089	45142	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Mr. Hamel has never spoken a word , and I will not talk about him . There ! All my heart is open to you , Ayala . You know that . But I will not talk about Mr. Hamel . Aunt Emmeline wants you to come to Queen 's Gate . "
45143	45148	45037	45037	he	310	" I will not . "
45149	45173	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Or rather it is Sir Thomas who wants you to come . I do like Uncle Tom . I do , indeed . "
45174	45178	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" So do I. "
45179	45189	45037	45037	he	310	" You ought to come when he asks you . "
45190	45202	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Why ought I ? That lout would be there,--of course . "
45203	45216	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" I do n't know about his being a lout , Ayala . "
45217	45298	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" He comes here , and I have to be perfectly brutal to him . You ca n't guess the sort of things I say to him , and he does n't mind it a bit . He thinks that he has to go on long enough , and that I must give way at last . If I were to go to Queen 's Gate it would be just as much as to say that I had given way . "
45299	45303	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Why not ? "
45304	45307	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Lucy ! "
45308	45338	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Why not ? He is not bad . He is honest , and true , and kind - hearted . I know you ca n't be happy here . "
45339	45342	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" No . "
45343	45369	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" Aunt Dosett , with all her affairs , must be trouble to you . I could not bear them patiently . How can you ? "
45370	45409	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Because they are better than Tom Tringle . I read somewhere about there being seven houses of the Devil , each one being lower and worse than the other . Tom would be the lowest,--the lowest,--the lowest . "
45410	45416	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Ayala , my darling . "
45417	45429	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Do not tell me that I ought to marry Tom , "
45443	45453	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Do you think that I could love him ? "
45454	45518	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" I think you could if you tried , because he is loveable . It is so much to be good , and then he loves you truly . After all , it is something to have everything nice around you . You have not been made to be poor and uncomfortable . I fear that it must be bad with you here . "
45519	45524	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" It is bad . "
45525	45549	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" I wish I could have stayed , Ayala . I am more tranquil than you , and could have borne it better . "
45550	45634	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" It is bad . It is one of the houses,--but not the lowest . I can eat my heart out here , peaceably , and die with a great needle in my hand and a towel in my lap . But if I were to marry him I should kill myself the first hour after I had gone away with him . Things ! What would things be with such a monster as that leaning over one ? Would you marry him ? "
45646	45663	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" Why do n't you say ? You want me to marry him . Would you ? "
45664	45667	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" No . "
45668	45674	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Then why should I ? "
45675	45684	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" I could not try to love him . "
45685	45726	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" Try ! How can a girl try to love any man ? It should come because she ca n't help it , let her try ever so . Trying to love Tom Tringle ! Why ca n't you try ? "
45727	45734	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" He does n't want me . "
45735	45764	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" But if he did ? I do n't suppose it would make the least difference to him which it was . Would you try if he asked ? "
45765	45768	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" No . "
45769	45785	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" Then why should I ? Am I so much a poorer creature than you ? "
45786	45800	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" You are a finer creature . You know that I think so . "
45801	45817	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" I do n't want to be finer . I want to be the same . "
45818	45834	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" You are free to do as you please . I am not -- quite . "
45835	45841	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" That means Isadore Hamel . "
45842	45877	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" I try to tell you all the truth , Ayala ; but pray do not talk about him even to me . As for you , you are free ; and if you could-- "
45878	45897	45431	45431	Ayala	287	" I ca n't . I do n't know that I am free , as you call it . "
45914	45933	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" You need n't look like that , Lucy . There is n't any one to be named . "
45934	45942	45640	45640	Lucy	266	" A man not to be named ? "
45943	46087	45899	45899	Lucy	266	" There is n't a man at all . There is n't anybody . But I may have my own ideas if I please . If I had an Isadore Hamel of my own I could compare Tom or Mr. Traffick , or any other lout to him , and could say how infinitely higher in the order of things was my Isadore than any of them . Though I have n't an Isadore ca n't I have an image ? And ca n't I make my image brighter , even higher , than Isadore ? You wo n't believe that , of course , and I do n't want you to believe it yourself . But you should believe it for me . My image can make Tom Tringle just as horrible to me as Isadore Hamel can make him to you . "
46148	46156	46158	46158	Lucy	266	" But how shall I say it ? "
46160	46248	46158	46158	Lucy	266	" Tell her the truth , openly . ' Tom wants to marry Ayala , and Ayala wo n't have him . Therefore , of course , she ca n't come , because it would look as though she were going to change her mind,--which she is n't . ' Aunt Emmeline will understand that , and will not be a bit sorry . She does n't want to have me for a daughter - in - law . She had quite enough of me at Rome . "
46417	46427	46429	46429	Ayala	287	" She knows nothing of what I am suffering , "
46431	46471	46429	46429	Ayala	287	" when she gives me the things to do , and tells me of more things , and more , and more ! How can there be so many things to be done in such a house as this ? "
46810	46813	46815	46815	Augusta	302	" Mamma , "
46817	46849	46815	46815	Augusta	302	" I suppose I can leave a lot of things in the big wardrobe . Jemima says I can not take them to Merle Park without ever so many extra trunks . "
46850	46882	46896	46896	Augusta	302	" Certainly , my dear . When anybody occupies the room , they wo n't want all the wardrobe . I do n't know that any one will come this summer . "
46939	46951	47020	47020	she	302	" Mamma , I suppose Septimus can leave his things here ? "
46952	46968	47020	47020	she	302	" Of course , my dear ; he can leave anything,--to be taken care of . "
46969	46985	47020	47020	she	302	" It will be so convenient if we can come back,--just for a few days . "
47102	47111	47113	47114	Lady Tringle	282	" I think you must ask your papa , "
47116	47123	47125	47128	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" Could n't you ask him ? "
47156	47166	47145	47146	Sir Thomas,--beginning	271	" I suppose Septimus can leave his things here ? "
47167	47181	47183	47184	Sir Thomas	271	" Where do they mean to live when they come back to town ? "
47188	47205	47207	47208	Lady Tringle	282	" I suppose it would be convenient if they could come here for a little time , "
47210	47238	47207	47208	Lady Tringle	282	" And stay till the end of the season,--and then go down to Glenbogie , and then to Merle Park ! Where do they mean to live ? "
47239	47249	47251	47252	Lady Tringle	282	" I think there was a promise about Glenbogie , "
47254	47313	47251	47252	Lady Tringle	282	" I never made a promise . I heard Traffick say that he would like to have some shooting,--though , as far as I know , he ca n't hit a haystack . They may come to Glenbogie for two or three weeks , if they like , but they sha n't stay here during the entire summer . "
47314	47326	47207	47208	Lady Tringle	282	" You wo n't turn your own daughter out , Tom . "
47327	47345	47347	47348	Sir Thomas	271	" I 'll turn Traffick out , and I suppose he 'll take his wife with him , "
47449	47457	47459	47460	Sir Thomas	271	" How long is it to be ? "
47537	47555	47523	47523	he	271	" I am not going to put up with it , and he need n't think it . "
47556	47567	47575	47576	the father	757	" Do n't destroy poor Augusta 's happiness so soon . "
47568	47573	47575	47576	the father	757	" That be d----d , "
47580	47612	47575	47576	the father	757	" Who 's going to destroy her happiness . Her happiness ought to consist in living in her husband 's house . What have I given her all that money for ? "
47735	47744	47745	47745	he	271	" Well , Traffick , how are you ? "
47768	47780	47745	47745	he	271	" I have n't seen you since you 've been back . "
47781	47798	47745	47745	he	271	" I 've been in the House morning , noon , and night , pretty near . "
47799	47814	47745	47745	he	271	" I dare say . I hope you found yourself comfortable at Merle Park . "
47815	47836	47745	47745	he	271	" A charming house,--quite charming . I do n't know whether I should n't build the stables a little further from-- "
47837	47867	47745	47745	he	271	" Very likely . Nothing is so easy as knocking other people 's houses about . I hope you 'll soon have one to knock about of your own . "
47868	47874	47876	47877	Mr. Traffick	321	" All in good time , "
48136	48168	48112	48112	he	2044	" I wish I might;--a Merle Park of my own for instance . If I had gone into the city instead of to Westminster it might have come in my way . "
48169	48191	48096	48097	Mr. Traffick	321	" It seems to me that a good deal has come in your way without very much trouble on your part . "
48192	48215	48112	48112	he	2044	" A seat in the House is a nice thing,--but I work harder I take it than you do , Sir Thomas . "
48216	48241	48112	48112	he	2044	" I never have had a shilling but what I earned . When you leave this where are you and Augusta going to live ? "
48273	48298	48112	48112	he	2044	" Where shall we go when we leave this ? You were so kind as to say something about Glenbogie when Parliament is up . "
48299	48306	48112	48112	he	2044	" No , I did n't . "
48307	48314	48112	48112	he	2044	" I thought I understood it . "
48315	48325	48112	48112	he	2044	" You said something and I did n't refuse . "
48326	48337	48112	48112	he	2044	" Put it any way you like , Sir Thomas . "
48338	48391	48112	48112	he	2044	" But what do you mean to do before Parliament is up ? The long and the short of it is , we did n't expect you to come back after the holidays . I like to be plain . This might go on for ever if I did n't speak out . "
48392	48405	48406	48407	Sir Thomas	271	" And a very comfortable way of going on it would be . "
48422	48432	48409	48409	his	271	" Of course I 'm thinking of Augusta chiefly . "
48433	48451	48112	48112	he	2044	" Augusta made up her mind no doubt to leave her father 's house when she married . "
48452	48480	48112	48112	he	2044	" She shows her affection for her parents by wishing to remain in it . The fact , I suppose , is , you want the rooms . "
48481	48502	48409	48409	his	271	" But even if we did n't ? You 're not going to live here for ever , I suppose . "
48503	48569	48112	48112	he	2044	" That , Sir , is too good to be thought of , I fear . The truth is we had an idea of staying at my father 's . He spoke of going down to the country and lending us the house . My sisters have made him change his mind and so here we are . Of course we can go into lodgings . "
48570	48576	48112	48112	he	2044	" Or to an hotel . "
48577	48627	48628	48629	Sir Thomas	271	" Too dear ! You see you 've made me pay such a sum for insuring my life . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . If you 'll let us make it out here till the 10th of July we 'll go into an hotel then . "
48643	48657	48628	48629	Sir Thomas	271	" And then we can have a month at Glenbogie from the 12th . "
48658	48662	48664	48665	Sir Thomas	271	" Three weeks , "
48675	48703	48672	48672	his	271	" Very well ; three weeks . If you could have made it the month it would have been convenient ; but I hate to be disagreeable . "
48721	48728	48730	48730	Augusta	302	" What are we to do ? "
48738	48752	48730	48730	Augusta	302	" What are we to do when we are made to go away ? "
48753	48783	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" I hope I shall be able to make some of the girls go down by that time , and then we must squeeze in at my father 's . "
48801	48804	48805	48805	he	271	" Tom , "
48811	48820	48805	48805	he	271	" is the biggest fool that ever lived . "
48821	48830	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" What is the matter with him now ? "
48846	48884	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" He 's away half his time , and when he does come he 'd better be away . If he wants to marry that girl why does n't he marry her and have done with it ? "
48906	48919	48920	48920	she	282	" I 'm sure I should be very sorry to see it , "
48923	48966	48920	48920	she	282	" Why should you be sorry ? Is n't it the best thing a young man can do ? If he 's set his heart that way all the world wo n't talk him off . I thought all that was settled . "
48967	48977	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" You ca n't make the girl marry him . "
48978	48983	48985	48986	Sir Thomas	271	" Is that it ? "
48992	49005	48985	48986	Sir Thomas	271	" You used to say she was setting her cap at him . "
49006	49074	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" She is one of those girls you do n't know what she would be at . She 's full of romance and nonsense , and is n't half as fond of telling the truth as she ought to be . She made my life a burden to me while she was with us , and I do n't think she would be any better for Tom . "
49075	49082	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" But he 's still determined . "
49083	49091	49093	49094	Lady Tringle	282	" What 's the use of that ? "
49096	49132	49093	49094	Lady Tringle	282	" Then he shall have her . I made him a promise and I 'm not going to give it up . I told him that if he was in earnest he should have her . "
49133	49145	48832	48833	Lady Tringle	282	" You ca n't make a girl marry a young man . "
49146	49200	49093	49094	Lady Tringle	282	" You have her here , and then we 'll take her to Glenbogie . Now when I say it I mean it . You go and fetch her , and if you do n't I will . I 'm not going to have her turned out into the cold in that way . "
49201	49209	49211	49211	he	2109	" She wo n't come , Tom . "
49249	49267	49268	49269	Mrs. Dosett	285	" My dear , your uncle particularly wants you to come to us for the next month . "
49274	49289	49268	49269	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I hope Ayala may be allowed to come to us for a month . "
49290	49297	49299	49300	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Ayala must answer for herself , "
49321	49326	49328	49328	Ayala	287	" I ca n't , "
49334	49341	49343	49344	Lady Tringle	282	" Why not , my dear ? "
49346	49351	49353	49353	Ayala	287	" I ca n't , "
49447	49454	49456	49457	Lady Tringle	282	" Your uncle has sent me , "
49459	49473	49474	49474	she	282	" and I must give him some reason . As for expense , you know,"--then
49481	49489	49474	49474	she	282	smile,--"that of course would be our affair . "
49490	49496	49498	49499	Mrs. Dosett	285	" If you ask me , "
49501	49532	49498	49499	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I think that as Ayala has come to us she had better remain with us . Of course things are very different , and she would be only discontented . "
49557	49565	49567	49567	Ayala	287	" Aunt Emmeline , I ca n't , "
49569	49593	49567	49567	Ayala	287	" But why , my dear ? Ca n't is n't a courteous answer to a request that is meant to be kind . "
49594	49600	49602	49603	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Speak out , Ayala , "
49605	49614	49602	49603	Mrs. Dosett	285	" There is nobody here but your aunts . "
49615	49620	49630	49631	Lady Tringle	282	" Because of Tom . "
49621	49628	49630	49631	Lady Tringle	282	" Tom would n't eat you , "
49636	49644	49646	49646	Ayala	287	" It 's worse than eating me , "
49648	49683	49646	49646	Ayala	287	" He will go on when I tell him not . If I were down there he 'd be doing it always . And then you 'd tell me that I -- encouraged him ! "
49880	49903	49872	49872	she	902	" You would n't be told anything of the kind , but you need n't come if you do n't like it . "
49904	49910	49915	49915	her	287	" Then I do n't , "
49918	49964	49915	49915	her	287	" But I did think that after all that has passed , and when I am trying to be kind to you , you would have made yourself more pleasant to me . I can only tell your uncle that you say you wo n't . "
49965	50000	50047	50047	Ayala	287	" Give my love to my uncle , and tell him that I am much obliged to him and that I know how good he is ; but I can't -- because of Tom . "
50001	50009	50011	50012	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Tom is too good for you , "
50036	50045	50047	50047	Ayala	287	" I did n't say he was n't , "
50053	50074	50047	50047	Ayala	287	" The Archbishop of Canterbury would be too good for me , but I do n't want to marry him . "
50359	50374	50376	50377	Lady Tringle	282	" I am afraid you are having a great deal of trouble with her , "
50382	50398	50376	50377	Lady Tringle	282	" No , indeed . Of course she is romantic , which is very objectionable . "
50399	50403	50405	50406	Lady Tringle	282	" Quite detestable ! "
50408	50434	50405	50406	Lady Tringle	282	" But she has been brought up like that , so that it is not her fault . Now she endeavours to do her best . "
50435	50441	50376	50377	Lady Tringle	282	" She is so upsetting . "
50442	50452	50405	50406	Lady Tringle	282	" She is angry because her cousin persecutes her . "
50453	50510	50405	50406	Lady Tringle	282	" Persecutes her , indeed ! Tom is in a position to ask any girl to be his wife . He can give her a home of her own , and a good income . She ought to be proud of the offer instead of speaking like that . But nobody wants her to have him . "
50511	50519	50376	50377	Lady Tringle	282	" He wants it , I suppose . "
50520	50580	50405	50406	Lady Tringle	282	" Just taken by her baby face;--that 's all . It wo n't last , and she need n't think so . However , I 've done my best to be kind , Mrs. Dosett , and there 's an end of it . If you please I 'll ring the bell for the carriage . Good - bye . "
50621	50626	50628	50629	his wife	672	" She positively refused , "
50631	50647	50628	50629	his wife	672	" and was so rude and impertinent that I could not possibly have her now . "
51205	51214	51215	51215	she	282	" Mamma , I mean to have him , "
51225	51229	51215	51215	she	282	" But papa ? "
51230	51248	51215	51215	she	282	" I mean to have him . Papa can scold , of course , if he pleases . "
51249	51264	51215	51215	she	282	" But where would the income come from if papa did not give it ? "
51265	51284	51293	51293	she	404	" Of course he 'll give it . I 've a right to it as much as Augusta . "
51459	51515	51516	51518	The old brick	2182	" You are a mercantile old brick , with money and a daughter . I am a jeunesse dorée,--gilded by blood and fashion , though so utterly impecunious ! Let us know your terms . How much is it to be , and then I can say whether we can afford to live upon it . "
51731	51748	51750	51751	Frank Houston	282	" I think that I may boast that your daughter 's happiness is in my charge , "
51753	51760	51762	51763	Sir Thomas	271	" Then she must be unhappy , "
51770	51782	51767	51767	his	2184	" A fool like that has no right to be happy . "
51783	51805	51807	51807	Houston	282	" There is n't another man in the world by whom I would allow her to be spoken of like that , "
51809	51812	51807	51807	Houston	282	" Bother ! "
51813	51856	51767	51767	his	2184	" I regard her as all that is perfect in woman , and you must forgive me if I say that I shall not abandon my suit . I may be allowed , at any rate , to call at the house ? "
51857	51861	51767	51767	his	2184	" Certainly not . "
51862	51875	51877	51877	Houston	282	" That is a kind of thing that is never done nowadays;--never , "
51883	51893	51877	51877	Houston	282	" I suppose my own house is my own . "
51894	51944	51767	51767	his	2184	" Yours and Lady Tringle 's , and your daughters ' , no doubt . At any rate , Sir Thomas , you will think of this again . I am sure you will think of it again . If you find that your daughter 's happiness depends upon it-- "
51945	51957	51877	51877	Houston	282	" I shall find nothing of the kind . Good morning . "
51958	51965	51877	51877	Houston	282	" Good morning , Sir Thomas . "
51998	52005	52007	52007	Gertrude	404	" Papa is always like that , "
52064	52073	52048	52049	Lady Tringle	282	" But he comes round , I suppose . "
52074	52113	52048	52049	Lady Tringle	282	" If he does n't have too much to eat,--which disagrees with him,--he does . He 's always better down at Glenbogie because he 's out of doors a good deal , and then he can digest things . "
52114	52129	52048	52049	Lady Tringle	282	" Then take him down to Glenbogie and let him digest it at once . "
52130	52162	52048	52049	Lady Tringle	282	" Of course we ca n't go till the 12th . Perhaps we shall start on the 10th , because the 11th is Sunday . What will you do , Frank ? "
52270	52308	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" I am thinking of wandering away somewhere;--perhaps to the Tyrol . The Mudbury Docimers are there . He 's a pal of mine , besides being a cousin . Mrs. Docimer is a very nice woman . "
52309	52314	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" And her sister ? "
52315	52339	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" A lovely creature . Such a turn of the neck ! I 've promised to make a study of her back head . "
52340	52346	52348	52348	Gertrude	404	" Come down to Glenbogie , "
52352	52374	52348	52348	Gertrude	404	" How can I do that when your governor wo n't let me enter his house - door even in London ? "
52375	52381	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" But you 're here . "
52382	52433	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" Well,--yes;--I am here . But he told me not . I do n't see how I 'm to drive in at the gate at Glenbogie with all my traps , and ask to be shown my room . I have cheek enough for a good deal , my pet . "
52434	52469	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" I believe you have , Sir;--cheek enough for anything . But mamma must manage it,--mamma and me , between us . Only keep yourself disengaged . You wo n't go to the Tyrol,--eh ? "
52498	52506	52508	52509	Sir Thomas	271	" I wo n't hear of it , "
52526	52535	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" He only wants to get my money . "
52536	52553	52508	52509	Sir Thomas	271	" But Gertrude has set her heart on it , and nothing will turn her away . "
52554	52579	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" Why ca n't she set her heart on some one who has got a decent income . That man has n't a shilling . "
52580	52587	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" Nor yet has Mr. Traffick . "
52588	52659	52508	52509	Sir Thomas	271	" Mr. Traffick has , at any rate , got an occupation . Were it to do again , Mr. Traffick would never see a shilling of my money . By ---- , those fellows , who have n't got a pound belonging to them , think that they 're to live on the fat of the land out of the sweat of the brow of such men as me . "
52660	52674	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" What is your money for , Tom , but for the children ? "
52675	52718	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" I know what it 's for . I 'd sooner build a hospital than give it to an idle fellow like that Houston . When I asked him what he did , he said he was fond of ' picters ! ' "
52737	52766	52731	52731	he	271	" Of course he has n't been brought up to work . But he is a gentleman , and I do think he would make our girl happy . "
52767	52779	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" My money would make him happy,--till he had spent it . "
52780	52785	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" Tie it up . "
52786	52811	52731	52731	he	271	" You do n't know what you 're talking about . How are you to prevent a man from spending his wife 's income ? "
52812	52842	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" At any rate , if you have him down at Glenbogie you can see what sort of a man he is . You do n't know him now . "
52843	52851	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" As much as I wish to . "
52852	52905	52238	52239	an artist	1105	" That is n't fair to the poor girl . You need n't give your consent to a marriage because he comes to Glenbogie . You have only to say that you wo n't give the money and then it must be off . They ca n't take the money from you . "
53483	53489	53479	53479	his	376	" a sort of grind , "
53710	53716	53717	53717	He	376	" Dear , dearest Imogene ! "
53760	53764	53765	53765	he	376	" Duty first ! "
54508	54512	54531	54531	he	380	" My home , "
54517	54529	54531	54531	he	380	" shows gallanter still . ' Tis the garret up three pair-- "
55064	55074	55076	55077	the Marchesa	329	" So now you have got our friend Ayala , "
55085	55115	55076	55077	the Marchesa	329	" Yes ; we have her now . There has been a change . Her sister , Lucy , has gone to my husband 's sister , Lady Tringle . "
55304	55319	55291	55293	the grand lady	2292	" We used to know her so well in Rome;--did we not , Ayala ? "
55320	55328	55418	55419	the Marchesa	329	" You were very kind to me . "
55329	55416	55418	55419	the Marchesa	329	" Nina could n't come , because her father would make her go with him to the pictures . But now , my dear , you must come to us just for a little time . We have a furnished house in Brook Street , near the park , till the end of the season , and we have one small spare room which will just do for you . I hope you will let her come to us , for we really are old friends , "
55552	55559	55561	55562	the Marchesa	329	" Ca n't we manage it ? "
55564	55572	55574	55574	Ayala	287	" I do n't think we can , "
55581	55586	55574	55574	Ayala	287	" And why not ? "
55595	55605	55606	55606	she	287	" I suppose I may tell , Aunt Margaret ? "
55609	55618	55620	55621	Mrs. Dosett	285	" You may tell everything , my dear , "
55623	55629	55631	55631	Ayala	287	" Because we are poor , "
55633	55639	55641	55642	the Marchesa	329	" What does that matter ? "
55647	55662	55641	55642	the Marchesa	329	" We want you because you are rich in good gifts and pretty ways . "
55663	55733	55753	55754	the Marchesa	329	" But I ca n't get new frocks now as I used to do in Rome . Aunt Emmeline was cruel to me , and said things which I could not bear . But they let me have everything . Uncle Reginald gives me all that he has , and I am much happier here . But we can not go out and buy things,--can we , Aunt Margaret ? "
55734	55744	55753	55754	the Marchesa	329	" No , my dear ; we can not . "
55745	55751	55753	55754	the Marchesa	329	" It does not signify , "
55756	55887	55753	55754	the Marchesa	329	" We are quite quiet , and what you have got will do very well . Frocks ! The frocks you had in Rome are good enough for London . I wo n't have a word of all that . Nina has set her heart upon it , and so has my husband , and so have I. Mrs. Dosett , when we are at home we are the most homely people in the world . We think nothing of dressing . Not to come and see your old friends because of your frocks ! We shall send for you the day after to - morrow . Do n't you know , Mrs. Dosett , it will do her good to be with her young friend for a few days . "
55931	55941	55943	55944	Sir Thomas	271	" If you would n't mind , Mrs. Dosett , "
55950	55959	55943	55944	Sir Thomas	271	" I should like to see Ayala alone . "
55980	55984	55985	55985	he	271	" My dear , "
56002	56014	55985	55985	he	271	" I have got something very particular to say to you . "
56162	56180	56144	56144	he	734	" I hope you think that I have always wished to be kind to you , Ayala . "
56181	56191	56136	56136	he	734	" I am sure you have , Uncle Tom . "
56192	56232	56144	56144	he	734	" When you had come to us I always wished you to stay . I do n't like changes of this sort . I suppose you did n't hit it off with Augusta . But she 's gone now . "
56233	56239	56144	56144	he	734	" Aunt Emmeline said something . "
56245	56248	56144	56144	he	734	" encouragement , "
56272	56283	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" I do n't want to hear anything about it , "
56288	56317	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" Let bygones be bygones . Your aunt , I am sure , never meant unkindly by you . Now , I want you to listen to me . "
56318	56325	56351	56351	Ayala	287	" I will , Uncle Tom . "
56326	56339	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" Listen to me to the end , like a good girl . "
56340	56344	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" I will . "
56345	56350	56351	56351	Ayala	287	" Your Cousin Tom-- . "
56393	56404	56389	56389	he	271	" Your Cousin Tom is most truly attached to you . "
56405	56416	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" Why wo n't he leave me alone , then ? "
56417	56429	56366	56366	she	287	" Ayala , you promised to listen to me without speaking . "
56430	56438	56389	56389	he	271	" I will , Uncle Tom . Only-- "
56439	56455	56285	56286	Sir Thomas	271	" Listen to me , and then I will hear anything you have to say . "
56456	56460	56462	56462	Ayala	287	" I will , "
56492	56593	56487	56488	Sir Thomas	271	" Your Cousin Tom is most truly attached to you . For some time I and his mother disapproved of this . We thought you were both too young , and there were other reasons which I need not now mention . But when I came to see how thoroughly he was in earnest , how he put his heart into it , how the very fact that he loved you had made a man of him ; then how the fact that you would not return his love unmanned him,--when I saw all that , I gave my permission . "
56623	56666	56606	56606	Ayala	287	" Yes ; we gave our permission,--I and your aunt . Of course , our son 's happiness is all in all to us ; and I do believe that you are so good that you would make him a good wife . "
56667	56669	56595	56595	he	2307	" But-- "
56670	56679	56595	56595	he	2307	" Listen till I have done , Ayala . "
56686	56859	56860	56860	Ayala	287	" I suppose you are what they call romantic . Romance , my dear , wo n't buy bread and butter . Tom is a very good young man , and he loves you most dearly . If you will consent to be his I will make a rich man of him . He will then be a respectable man of business , and will become a partner in the house . You and he can choose a place to live in almost where you please . You can have your own establishment and your carriage , and will be able to do a deal of good . You will make him happy , and you will be my dear child . I have come here to tell you that I will make you welcome into the family , and to promise that I will do everything I can to make you happy . Now you may say what you like ; but , Ayala , think a little before you speak . "
57082	57090	57091	57091	she	287	" Uncle Tom , I ca n't , "
57104	57124	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" Why ca n't you , Ayala ? Why can not you be sensible , as other girls are ? "
57140	57145	57146	57146	she	287	" I ca n't , "
57149	57159	57146	57146	she	287	" I do n't know how to tell you . "
57160	57168	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" Do you love some other man ? "
57169	57176	57146	57146	she	287	" No ; no ; no ! "
57193	57199	57185	57185	she	287	" Then why is it ? "
57200	57231	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" Because I ca n't . I do n't know what to say , but I ca n't . I know how very , very , very good you are . "
57232	57241	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" I would love you as my daughter . "
57242	57274	57185	57185	she	287	" But I ca n't , Uncle Tom . Pray tell him , and make him get somebody else . He would be quite happy if he could get somebody else . "
57275	57283	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" It is you that he loves . "
57284	57331	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" But what 's the use of it , when I ca n't ? Dear , dear Uncle Tom , do have it all settled for me . Nothing on earth could ever make me do it . I should die if I were to try . "
57332	57337	57185	57185	she	287	" That 's nonsense . "
57338	57378	57126	57127	Sir Thomas	271	" I do so want not to make you angry , Uncle Tom . And I do so wish he would be happy with someone else . Nobody ought to be made to marry unless they like it;--ought they ? "
57379	57387	57389	57390	Sir Thomas	271	" There is no talk of making , "
57394	57402	57404	57404	Ayala	287	" At any rate I ca n't , "
57553	57570	57572	57572	he	734	" I am sorry to make you angry , but I ca n't , Uncle Tom . "
57715	57720	57721	57721	she	426	" Oh , Ayala , "
57724	57747	57721	57721	she	426	" this is so nice to have you again . I have been looking forward to this ever since we left Rome . "
57748	57751	57753	57753	Ayala	287	" Yes , "
57755	57760	57721	57721	she	426	" it is nice . "
57761	57803	57721	57721	she	426	" But why did you tell mamma you would not come ? What nonsense to talk to her about frocks ? Why not come and tell me ? You used to have everything at Rome , much more than I had . "
57851	57855	57856	57856	she	287	" You see , "
57859	57900	57856	57856	she	287	" when papa died Lucy and I were divided . I got the rich uncle , and Lucy got the poor one ; but I made myself disagreeable , and did n't suit , and so we have been changed . "
57901	57910	57912	57912	Nina	426	" But why did you make yourself disagreeable ? "
57918	57945	57912	57912	Nina	426	" I remember when we were at Rome your cousin Augusta was always quarrelling with you . I never quite knew what it was all about . "
57946	57953	57955	57955	Ayala	287	" It was n't only that , "
57959	57967	57955	57955	Ayala	287	" Did you do anything very bad ? "
58001	58013	58018	58018	she	287	" And that was the real reason why we were changed , "
58023	58031	58033	58033	Nina	426	" I remember seeing the young man , "
58035	58042	58033	58033	Nina	426	" He is such a lout ! "
58043	58052	58054	58054	Nina	426	" But was he very much in love ? "
58056	58105	58054	58054	Nina	426	" Well , I do n't know . I suppose he was after his way . I do n't think louts like that can be very much in love to signify . Young men when they look like that would do with one girl as well as another . "
58106	58115	58117	58117	Nina	426	" I do n't see that at all , "
58119	58154	58117	58117	Nina	426	" I am sure he would if he 'd only try . At any rate what 's the good of his going on ? They ca n't make a girl marry unless she chooses . "
58155	58162	58054	58054	Nina	426	" Wo n't he be rich ? "
58163	58167	58169	58169	Ayala	287	" Awfully rich , "
58171	58180	58182	58186	the young lady from Rome	2324	" Then I should think about it again , "
58188	58191	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" Never , "
58200	58223	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" I will never think about it again . If he were made of diamonds I would not think about it again . "
58224	58233	58235	58235	Nina	426	" And is that why you were changed ? "
58237	58301	58235	58235	Nina	426	" Well , yes . No ; it is very hard to explain . Aunt Emmeline told me that -- that I encouraged him . I thought I should have rushed out of the house when she said that . Then I had to be changed . I do n't know whether they could forgive me , but I could not forgive her . "
58302	58309	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" And how is it now ? "
58310	58316	58318	58318	Ayala	287	" It is different now , "
58322	58333	58318	58318	Ayala	287	" Only that it ca n't make any real difference . "
58334	58338	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" How different ? "
58339	58364	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" They 'd let me come if I would , I suppose ; but I shall never , never go to them any more . "
58365	58375	58377	58377	Nina	426	" I suppose you wo n't tell me everything ? "
58383	58387	58377	58377	Nina	426	" What everything ? "
58388	58398	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" You wo n't be angry if I ask ? "
58399	58408	58193	58193	Ayala	287	" No , I will not be angry . "
58409	58421	58377	58377	Nina	426	" I suppose there is someone else you really care for ? "
58422	58428	58430	58430	Ayala	287	" There is no one , "
58441	58455	58377	58377	Nina	426	" Then why should you be so determined against that poor young man ? "
58456	58466	58468	58468	Ayala	287	" Because he is a lout and a beast , "
58473	58531	58468	58468	Ayala	287	" I wonder you should ask me;--as if that had anything to do with it . Would you fall in love with a lout because you had no one else ? I would rather live for ever all alone , even in Kingsbury Crescent , than have to think of becoming the wife of my cousin Tom . "
59368	59378	59380	59380	he	2350	" You are Ayala Dormer , I am sure , "
59448	59476	59442	59442	his	2350	" I knew you were , and I am Jonathan Stubbs . So now we are introduced , and you are to come and dance with me . "
59506	59514	59515	59515	she	287	" But I do n't know you , "
59555	59561	59563	59564	Jonathan Stubbs	385	" Yes , you do , "
59566	59589	59563	59564	Jonathan Stubbs	385	" and if you 'll come and dance I 'll tell you about it . The Marchesa told me to take you . "
59590	59594	59596	59596	Ayala	287	" Did she ? "
59610	59641	59596	59596	Ayala	287	" I 'll go and fetch her if you like ; only she 's a long way off , and we shall lose our place . She 's my aunt . "
59642	59645	59647	59647	Ayala	287	" Oh , "
59831	59835	59836	59836	he	2354	" There now , "
59839	59856	59836	59836	he	2354	" we ca n't get in at any of the sets . That 's your fault . "
59857	59864	59866	59866	Ayala	287	" No , it is n't , "
59868	59887	59836	59836	he	2354	" Yes , it is . You would n't stand up till you had heard all about me . "
59888	59898	59836	59836	he	2354	" I do n't know anything about you now . "
59899	59925	59836	59836	he	2354	" Then come and walk about and I 'll tell you . Then we shall be ready for a waltz . Do you waltz well ? "
59926	59930	59836	59836	he	2354	" Do you ? "
59931	60007	59836	59836	he	2354	" I 'll back myself against any Englishman , Frenchman , German , or Italian , for a large sum of money . I ca n't come quite up to the Poles . The fact is , the honester the man is the worse he always dances . Yes ; I see what you mean . I must be a rogue . Perhaps I am;--perhaps I 'm only an exception . I knew your father . "
60008	60011	59836	59836	he	2354	" Papa ! "
60012	60052	59836	59836	he	2354	" Yes , I did . He was down at Stalham with the Alburys once . That was five years ago , and he told me he had a daughter named Ayala . I did n't quite believe him . "
60053	60057	59836	59836	he	2354	" Why not ? "
60058	60072	59836	59836	he	2354	" It is such an out - of - the - way name . "
60073	60085	59836	59836	he	2354	" It 's as good as Jonathan , at any rate . "
60093	60156	60090	60090	her	287	" There 's a prejudice about Jonathan , as there is about Jacob and Jonah . I never could quite tell why . I was going to marry a girl once with a hundred thousand pounds , and she would n't have me at last because she could n't bring her lips to say Jonathan . Do you think she was right ? "
60157	60163	60165	60165	Ayala	287	" Did she love you ? "
60173	60230	60165	60165	Ayala	287	" Awfully ! But she could n't bear the name ; so within three months she gave herself and all her money to Mr. Montgomery Talbot de Montpellier . He got drunk , and threw her out of the window before a month was over . That 's what comes of going in for sweet names . "
60231	60241	60243	60243	Ayala	287	" I do n't believe a word of it , "
60245	60257	60243	60243	Ayala	287	" Very well . Did n't Septimus Traffick marry your cousin ? "
60258	60269	60165	60165	Ayala	287	" Of course he did , about a month ago . "
60270	60289	60165	60165	Ayala	287	" He is another friend of mine . Why did n't you go to your cousin 's marriage ? "
60290	60295	60297	60297	Ayala	287	" There were reasons , "
60299	60306	60308	60309	the Colonel	2361	" I know all about it , "
60311	60335	60308	60309	the Colonel	2361	" You quarreled with Augusta down in Scotland , and you do n't like poor Traffick because he has got a bald head . "
60336	60344	60346	60346	Ayala	287	" I believe you 're a conjuror , "
60348	60389	60346	60346	Ayala	287	" And then your cousin was jealous because you went to the top of St. Peter 's , and because you would walk with Mr. Traffick on the Pincian . I was in Rome , and saw all about it . "
60390	60402	60404	60404	Ayala	287	" I wo n't have anything more to do with you , "
60406	60426	60404	60404	Ayala	287	" And then you quarreled with one set of uncles and aunts , and now you live with another . "
60427	60434	60346	60346	Ayala	287	" Your aunt told you that . "
60435	60445	60346	60346	Ayala	287	" And I know your cousin , Tom Tringle . "
60446	60451	60453	60453	Ayala	287	" You know Tom ? "
60455	60519	60453	60453	Ayala	287	" Yes ; he was ever so good to me in Rome about a horse ; I like Tom Tringle in spite of his chains . Do n't you think , upon the whole , if that young lady had put up with Jonathan she would have done better than marry Montpellier ? But now they 're going to waltz , come along . "
60615	60624	60626	60627	the Marchesa	1419	" What do you think of my nephew ? "
60637	60647	60649	60649	Nina	426	" Do tell us what you think of Jonathan ? "
60651	60661	60649	60649	Nina	426	" I thought he was very good - natured . "
60662	60667	60626	60627	the Marchesa	1419	" And very handsome ? "
60668	60702	60649	60649	Nina	426	" Nina , do n't be foolish . Jonathan is one of the most rising officers in the British service , and luckily he can be that without being beautiful to look at . "
60703	60707	60709	60709	Nina	426	" I declare , "
60711	60765	60709	60709	Nina	426	" sometimes , when he is talking , I think him perfectly lovely . The fire comes out of his eyes , and he rubs his old red hairs about till they sparkle . Then he shines all over like a carbuncle , and every word he says makes me die of laughter . "
60766	60771	60773	60773	Ayala	287	" I laughed too , "
60775	60784	60786	60786	Nina	426	" But you did n't think him beautiful , "
60788	60795	60797	60797	Ayala	287	" No , I did not , "
60799	60836	60797	60797	Ayala	287	" I liked him very much , but I thought him very ugly . Was it true about the young lady who married Mr. Montgomery de Montpellier and was thrown out of window a week afterwards ? "
60837	60850	60852	60852	Nina	426	" There is one other thing I must tell you about Jonathan , "
60854	60865	60852	60852	Nina	426	" You must not believe a word that he says . "
60866	60871	60873	60874	the Marchesa	329	" That I deny , "
60876	60900	60873	60874	the Marchesa	329	" but here we are . And now , girls , get out of the carriage and go up to bed at once . "
61071	61084	61066	61066	he	385	" It all depends upon whether any one has anything to say . "
61326	61338	61325	61336	a " Sallow , sublime , sort of Werther - faced man	7865	" Sallow , sublime , sort of Werther - faced man , "
61602	61606	61607	61607	he	271	" Lady Baldoni , "
61610	61637	61607	61607	he	271	" I hope you wo n't think me intrusive , but I thought I 'd come and see my cousin once whilst she is staying here . "
61651	61657	61659	61659	Tom	271	" It 's tremendously hot , "
61661	61667	61669	61670	the Marchesa	329	" Very hot , indeed , "
61672	61687	61689	61689	Nina	426	" I do n't think it 's ever so hot as this in Rome , "
61694	61705	61707	61707	Tom	271	" I find it quite impossible to walk a yard , "
61709	61763	61707	61707	Tom	271	" and therefore I 've hired a Hansom cab all to myself . The man goes home and changes his horse regularly when I go to dinner ; then he comes for me at ten , and sticks to me till I go to bed . I call that a very good plan . "
61776	61783	61785	61785	he	271	" That would be a grind , "
61787	61828	61785	61785	he	271	" because it would be so hot all day , and there might be rain at night . Have you read what my brother - in - law , Traffick , said in the House last night , my Lady ? "
61829	61838	61840	61841	the Marchesa	329	" I 'm afraid I passed it over , "
61843	61855	61840	61841	the Marchesa	329	" Indeed , I am not very good at the debates . "
61856	61861	61863	61863	Tom	271	" They are dull , "
61865	61898	61863	61863	Tom	271	" but when it 's one 's brother - in - law , one does like to look at it . I thought he made that very clear about the malt tax . "
61905	61912	61914	61914	Nina	426	" What is -- malt tax ? "
61916	61923	61925	61925	Tom	271	" Well , it means beer , "
61927	61962	61925	61925	Tom	271	" The question is whether the poor man pays it who drinks the beer , or the farmer who grows the malt . It is very interesting when you come to think of it . "
61963	61976	61978	61979	the Marchesa	329	" But I fear I never have come to think of it , "
62047	62053	62055	62055	Ayala	287	" He is a lout , "
62070	62080	62082	62083	the Marchesa	329	" I do n't see anything loutish at all , "
62085	62095	62097	62097	Nina	426	" He 's just like most other young men , "
62099	62109	62111	62111	Ayala	287	" He 's not at all like Colonel Stubbs , "
62121	62128	62129	62129	she	329	" Colonel Stubbs , my dear , "
62132	62221	62129	62129	she	329	" happens to have been thrown a good deal about the world , and has thus been able to pick up that easy mode of talking which young ladies like , perhaps because it means nothing . Your cousin is a man of business , and will probably have amassed a large fortune when my poor nephew will be a do - nothing old general on half - pay . His chatter will not then have availed him quite so much as your cousin 's habits of business . "
62222	62225	62227	62227	Nina	426	" Mamma , "
62229	62238	62227	62227	Nina	426	" Jonathan will have money of his own . "
62239	62273	62274	62274	Ayala	287	" Never mind , my dear . I do not like to hear a young man called a lout because he 's more like a man of business than a man of pleasure . "
62376	62384	62386	62386	he	2402	" I 've been to the office , "
62388	62421	62386	62386	he	2402	" and got a stall next to yours , and have managed it all . It now only remains that you should give me some dinner and a seat in the carriage . "
62570	62625	62562	62562	she	287	" It is all very well , Nina , for your mamma to say that a young man of business is the best ; but I do know a lout when I see him ; and I am quite sure that my cousin Tom is a lout , and that Colonel Jonathan is not . "
62626	62638	62640	62640	Nina	426	" I believe you are falling in love with Colonel Jonathan , "
62642	62668	62640	62640	Nina	426	" I should as soon think of falling in love with a wild bear;--but he 's not a lout , and therefore I like him . "
62748	62762	62763	62763	he	310	" Now that we have met , am I to lose you again ? "
62893	62899	62884	62897	the man who had once asked whether he was " to lose her again	7906	" to lose her again . "
63043	63051	63052	63053	A girl	7358	" Am I to lose you again ? "
63079	63087	63088	63088	He	2044	" Am I to lose you again ? "
64111	64121	64123	64124	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Who was that young man , my dear ? "
64126	64132	64123	64124	Aunt Emmeline	290	" It was Mr. Hamel . "
64133	64138	64140	64141	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Mr. Isadore Hamel ! "
64145	64160	64140	64141	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Is that the young man at Rome who has got the horrible father ? "
64161	64169	64171	64171	Lucy	266	" I do not know his father , "
64173	64181	64171	64171	Lucy	266	" but he does live at Rome . "
64182	64245	64140	64141	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Of course , it 's the Mr. Hamel I mean . He scraped some acquaintance with Ayala , but I would not have it for a moment . He is not at all the sort of person any young girl ought to know . His father is a horrible man . I hope he is no friend of yours , Lucy ! "
64246	64254	64255	64255	Lucy	266	" He is a friend of mine . "
64295	64317	64140	64141	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Then , my dear , I hope that such friendship may be discontinued as long as you remain with us . "
64318	64327	64329	64329	Lucy	266	" He was a friend of papa 's , "
64331	64351	64329	64329	Lucy	266	" That 's all very well . I suppose artists must know artists , even though they are disreputable . "
64352	64359	64360	64361	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Mr. Hamel is not disreputable . "
64382	64386	64387	64387	she	266	" My dear , "
64397	64456	64396	64396	she	266	spoke,--"in a matter such as this I must beg you to be guided by me . You must acknowledge that I know the world better than you do . Mr. Hamel is not a fit person to be acquainted with a young lady who occupies the place of my daughter . I am sure that will be sufficient . "
64737	64757	64762	64763	her aunt	737	" Mr. Hamel is not fit to be acquainted with a lady who occupies the position of my daughter . "
64778	64813	64762	64763	her aunt	737	Lucy,--"In that case , my dear aunt , I can not for a moment longer occupy the position of your daughter , as I certainly am acquainted and shall remain acquainted with Mr. Hamel . "
64952	64959	64939	64939	she	266	words,--"Am I to lose you again ? "
65223	65228	65230	65231	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Are you aware , "
65238	65245	65230	65231	Aunt Emmeline	290	" that he is -- illegitimate . "
65254	65265	65246	65246	Lucy	266	" Is he -- is he -- engaged to you ? "
65266	65269	65271	65271	Lucy	266	" No , "
65275	65284	65271	65271	Lucy	266	" Has he asked you to marry him ? "
65285	65288	65290	65290	Lucy	266	" No , "
65292	65298	65300	65301	Lady Tringle	282	" Then what is it ? "
65331	65338	65300	65301	Lady Tringle	282	" He was papa 's friend . "
65339	65431	65246	65246	Lucy	266	" My dear , what can that matter ? Your poor papa has gone , and you are in my charge and your uncle 's . Surely you can not object to choose your friends as we should wish . Mr. Hamel is a gentleman of whom we do not approve . You can not have seen very much of him , and it would be very easy for you , should he bow to you again in the park , to let him see that you do not like it . "
65432	65439	65441	65441	Lucy	266	" But I do like it , "
65446	65449	65441	65441	Lucy	266	" Lucy ! "
65450	65493	65246	65246	Lucy	266	" I do like to see Mr. Hamel , and I feel almost sure that he will come and call here now that he has seen me . Last winter he asked me my address , and I gave him this house . "
65494	65504	65246	65246	Lucy	266	" When you were living with your Aunt Dosett ? "
65505	65548	65441	65441	Lucy	266	" Yes , I did , Aunt Emmeline . I thought Aunt Margaret would not like him to come to Kingsbury Crescent , and , as Ayala was to be here , I told him he might call at Queen 's Gate . "
65727	65730	65731	65731	she	266	" Lucy , "
65737	65746	65731	65731	she	266	" there must be an end of this . "
65747	65757	65759	65759	Lucy	266	" There can not be an end of it , "
65761	65786	65731	65731	she	266	" Do you mean to say that he is to come here to this house whether I and your uncle like it or not ? "
65787	65792	65794	65794	Lucy	266	" He will come , "
65796	65815	65794	65794	Lucy	266	" I am sure he will come . Now he has seen me he will come at once . "
65816	65829	65731	65731	she	266	" Why should he do that if he is not your lover ? "
65830	65833	65835	65835	Lucy,--and	400	" Because , "
65840	65854	65837	65837	she	266	" because-- . It is very hard to tell you , Aunt Emmeline . "
65855	65863	65865	65866	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Why should he come so quickly ? "
65869	65885	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" Because-- . Though he has said nothing to me such as that you mean , "
65897	65904	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" I believe that he will . "
65905	65909	65837	65837	she	266	" And you ? "
65910	65919	65837	65837	she	266	" If he did I should accept him . "
65920	65926	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" Has he any means ? "
65927	65933	65837	65837	she	266	" I do not know . "
65934	65939	65837	65837	she	266	" Have you any ? "
65940	65944	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" Certainly not . "
65945	65961	65837	65837	she	266	" And you would consent to be his wife after what I 've told you ? "
65962	65965	65967	65967	Lucy	266	" Yes , "
65969	65973	65967	65967	Lucy	266	" I should . "
65974	65999	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" Then it must not be in this house . That is all . I will not have him here on any pretence whatsoever . "
66000	66015	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" I thought not , Aunt Emmeline , and therefore I have told you . "
66016	66030	65967	65967	Lucy	266	" Do you mean that you will make an appointment with him elsewhere ? "
66031	66084	65888	65888	Lucy	266	" Certainly not . I have not in fact ever made an appointment with him . I do not know his address . Till yesterday I thought that he was in Rome . I never had a line from him in my life , and of course have never written to him . "
66145	66151	66153	66153	Lucy	266	" Now , Aunt Emmeline , "
66155	66237	66153	66153	Lucy	266	" I have told you everything . Of course you have a right to order , but I also have some right . You told me I was to drop Mr. Hamel , but I can not drop him . If he comes in my way I certainly shall not drop him . If he comes here I shall see him if I can . If you and Uncle Tom choose to turn me out of course you can do so . "
66238	66248	66250	66251	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I shall tell your uncle all about it , "
66255	66265	66250	66251	Aunt Emmeline	290	" and then you will hear what he says . "
66576	66591	66593	66594	Sir Thomas	271	" It would n't be a bad thing to have a husband for Lucy , "
66596	66606	66593	66594	Sir Thomas	271	" But the man has n't got a sixpence . "
66607	66613	66668	66669	Sir Thomas	271	" He has a profession . "
66614	66636	66637	66638	Sir Thomas	271	" I do n't know that he makes anything . And then think of his father ! He is -- illegitimate ! "
66646	66666	66637	66638	Sir Thomas	271	" And if you knew the way the old man lives in Rome ! He plays cards all Sunday ! "
66709	66722	66724	66725	Lady Tringle	282	" You would n't wish to have him at Queen 's Gate ? "
66727	66750	66724	66725	Lady Tringle	282	" Certainly not , if he makes nothing by his profession . A good deal , I think , depends upon that . "
66854	66858	66859	66859	she	266	" finding again , "
66910	66922	66923	66923	he	344	" I travelled down with a man I think you know , "
66926	66942	66923	66923	he	344	Lucy;--"at any rate your sister does , because I saw him with her at Rome . "
66952	66966	66968	66969	Frank Houston	344	" I did n't like to ask him whether he was coming here , "
66971	66980	66982	66983	Aunt Emmeline	290	" No ; he is not coming here , "
66985	66989	66991	66991	Gertrude	404	" Certainly not , "
67011	67038	66982	66983	Aunt Emmeline	290	" He said something about another man he used to know at Rome , before you came . He was a nephew of that Marchesa Baldoni . "
67039	67053	67055	67055	Gertrude	404	" She was a lady we did n't like a bit too well , "
67057	67076	67078	67079	Aunt Emmeline	290	" A very stuck - up sort of person , who did all she could to spoil Ayala , "
67081	67090	67092	67092	Lucy	266	" Ayala has just been staying with her , "
67094	67103	67092	67092	Lucy	266	" She has been very kind to Ayala . "
67104	67114	67116	67117	Aunt Emmeline	290	" We have nothing to do with that now , "
67119	67147	67116	67117	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Ayala can stay with whom she and her aunt pleases . Is this Mr. Hamel , whom you saw , a friend of the Marchesa 's ? "
67148	67161	67092	67092	Lucy	266	" He seemed to be a friend of the Marchesa 's nephew , "
67163	67236	67116	67117	Aunt Emmeline	290	Houston;--"one Colonel Stubbs . We used to see him at Rome , and a most curious man he is . His name is Jonathan , and I do n't suppose that any man was ever seen so red before . He is shooting somewhere , and Hamel seems to be going to join him . I thought he might have been coming here afterwards , as you all were in Rome together . "
67237	67245	67247	67248	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Certainly he is not coming here , "
67250	67264	67247	67248	Aunt Emmeline	290	" And as for Colonel Stubbs , I never heard of him before . "
67380	67397	67398	67398	he	321	" If he had a seat in the House it would be quite a different thing , "
67448	67455	67456	67457	Mr. Traffick	321	" It 's nothing to me , "
67462	67496	67456	67457	Mr. Traffick	321	" the money wo n't come out of my pocket ; but when a man has nothing else to do he is sure to spend all that he can lay his hands upon . "
67661	67668	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" I thought , Mr. Houston , "
67673	67682	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" that we had settled that matter before . "
67683	67687	67689	67689	Houston	344	" Not quite , "
67691	67712	67689	67689	Houston	344	" I do n't know why you should say so . I intended to be understood as expressing my mind . "
67713	67726	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" But you have been good enough to ask me down here . "
67727	67750	67752	67752	he	271	" I may ask a man to my house , I suppose , without intending to give him my daughter 's hand . "
67775	67787	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" Have you an income on which to maintain my daughter ? "
67788	67801	67803	67803	Houston	344	" I can not just say that I have , Sir Thomas , "
67807	67821	67803	67803	Houston	344	" Then you mean to ask me to furnish you with an income . "
67822	67835	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" You can do as you please about that , Sir Thomas . "
67836	67845	67670	67671	Sir Thomas	271	" You can hardly marry her without it . "
67846	67881	67803	67803	Houston	344	" Well ; no ; not altogether . No doubt it is true that I should not have proposed myself had I not thought that the young lady would have something of her own . "
67882	67891	67893	67894	Sir Thomas	271	" But she has nothing of her own , "
67903	67914	67915	67915	Houston	282	" You wo n't throw us over , Lady Tringle ? "
67924	67934	67936	67937	Lady Tringle	282	" Sir Thomas likes to have his own way , "
67939	67948	67936	67937	Lady Tringle	282	" Somebody got round him about Septimus Traffick . "
67949	67954	67956	67957	Lady Tringle	282	" That was different , "
67959	67992	67956	67957	Lady Tringle	282	" Mr. Traffick is in Parliament , and that gives him an employment . He is a son of Lord Boardotrade , and some of these days he will be in office . "
67993	68066	67936	67937	Lady Tringle	282	" Of course , you know that if Gertrude sticks to it she will have her own way . When a girl sticks to it her father has to give way . What does it matter to him whether I have any business or not ? The money would be the same in one case as the other , only it does seem such an unnecessary trouble to have it put off . "
68118	68124	68125	68125	she	404	" It 's all bosh , "
68131	68154	68125	68125	she	404	" Who is Lord Boardotrade that that should make a difference ? I have as much right to please myself as Augusta . "
68240	68248	68236	68237	The father	757	" of his house and his home , "
68387	68394	68430	68430	he	2567	" of your house and your home "
68908	68911	68912	68912	she	404	" Mamma , "
68915	68926	68912	68912	she	404	" I think that papa is not treating me well . "
68927	68940	69154	69155	Miss Tringle	404	" My dear , your papa has always had his own way . "
68941	68973	68912	68912	she	404	" That is all very well;--but why am I to be worse used than Augusta ? It turns out now that Mr. Traffick has not got a shilling of his own . "
68974	68983	68912	68912	she	404	" Your papa likes his being in Parliament . "
68984	68995	68912	68912	she	404	" All the girls ca n't marry Members of Parliament . "
68996	69008	69154	69155	Miss Tringle	404	" And he likes his being the son of Lord Boardotrade . "
69009	69099	68912	68912	she	404	" Lord Boardotrade ! I call that very mean . Mr. Houston is a gentleman , and the Buncombe property has been for ever so many hundreds of years in the family . I think more of Frank as to birth and all that than I do of Lord Boardotrade and his mushroom peerage . Ca n't you tell papa that I mean to marry Mr. Houston at last , and that he is making very little of me to let me be talked about as I shall be ? "
69100	69110	68912	68912	she	404	" I do n't think I can , Gertrude . "
69111	69129	68912	68912	she	404	" Then I shall . What would he say if I were to run away with Frank ? "
69130	69141	69154	69155	Miss Tringle	404	" I do n't think Frank Houston would do that . "
69142	69152	68912	68912	she	404	" He would if I told him,--in a moment . "
69161	69182	69154	69155	Miss Tringle	404	" And unless papa consents I shall tell him . I am not going to be made miserable for ever . "
69712	69720	69722	69723	the Colonel	2361	" I never knew them in Rome , "
69725	69791	69722	69723	the Colonel	2361	" I never even saw Ayala there , though she was so much at my aunt 's house . I was in Sicily part of the time , and did not get back till they had all quarrelled . I did know the nephew , who was a good - natured but a vulgar young man . They are vulgar people , I should say . "
69792	69801	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" You could hardly have found Ayala vulgar ? "
69805	69837	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" Indeed , no . But uncles and aunts and nephews and nieces are not at all bound to run together . Ayala is the daintiest little darling I ever saw . "
69838	69856	69722	69723	the Colonel	2361	" I knew their father and mother , and certainly no one would have called them vulgar . "
69857	69937	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" Sisters when they marry of course go off according to their husbands , and the children follow . In this case one sister became Tringlish after Sir Tringle , and the other Dormerish , after that most improvident of human beings , your late friend the artist . I do n't suppose any amount of experience will teach Ayala how many shillings there are in a pound . No doubt the Honourable Mrs. Traffick knows all about it . "
69938	69959	69961	69961	Hamel	310	" I do n't think a girl is much improved by knowing how many shillings there are in a pound , "
69963	69969	69961	69961	Hamel	310	" It is useful sometimes . "
69970	70041	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" So it might be to kill a sheep and skin it , or to milk a cow and make cheese ; but here , as in other things , one acquirement will drive out others . A woman , if she can not be beautiful , should at any rate be graceful , and if she can not soar to poetry , should at least be soft and unworldly . "
70042	70127	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" That 's all very well in its way , but I go in for roasting , baking , and boiling . I can bake and I can brew ; I can make an Irish stew ; Wash a shirt and iron it too . That 's the sort of girl I mean to go in for if ever I marry ; and when you 've got six children and a small income it 's apt to turn out better than grace and poetry . "
70128	70135	70137	70137	Hamel	310	" A little of both perhaps , "
70139	70256	70137	70137	Hamel	310	" Well , yes ; I do n't mind a little Byron now and again , so there is no nonsense . As to Glenbogie , it 's right over there across the lake . You can get a boat at Callerfoot , and a fellow to take you across and wait for you wo n't cost you more than three half - crowns . I suppose Glenbogie is as far from the lake on that side as my cottage is on this . How you 'll get up except by walking I can not say , unless you will write a note to Sir Thomas and ask him to send a horse down for you . "
70257	70265	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" Sir Thomas would not accommodate me . "
70266	70279	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" You think he will frown if you come after his niece ? "
70280	70290	70292	70292	Hamel	310	" I simply want to call on Miss Dormer , "
70296	70306	70292	70292	Hamel	310	" because her father was always kind to me . "
70307	70317	70319	70320	the Colonel	2361	" I do n't mean to ask any questions , "
70322	70345	70319	70320	the Colonel	2361	" It is just so as I say . I do not like being in the neighbourhood without calling on Miss Dormer . "
70346	70351	69803	69803	Hamel	310	" I daresay not . "
70352	70399	70292	70292	Hamel	310	" But I doubt whether Sir Thomas or Lady Tringle would be at all inclined to make me welcome . As to the distance , I can walk that easily enough , and if the door is slammed in my face I can walk back again . "
70905	70925	70928	70932	the owner of the pony	2667	" Ye'll nae get there under twalve mile,--or maybe saxteen , if ye attampt to walk up the glin . "
71035	71042	71044	71045	the boy	2675	" It 's his ain sell , "
71157	71165	71167	71168	Sir Thomas	271	" That 's not a high road , "
71212	71235	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" Your way up to the house , if you are going there , would have been through the lodge down there . "
71236	71244	71246	71246	Hamel	310	" Perhaps you are Sir Thomas Tringle , "
71248	71254	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" That is my name . "
71255	71303	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" Then I have to ask your pardon for my mode of ingress . I am going up to the house ; but having crossed the lake from Callerfoot I did not know my way on this side , and so I have clambered up the ravine . "
71315	71325	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" I believe Miss Dormer is at the house ? "
71326	71332	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" My niece is there . "
71333	71388	71205	71205	Hamel	310	" My name is Hamel,--Isadore Hamel . I am a sculptor , and used to be acquainted with her father . I have had great kindness from the whole family , and so I was going to call upon her . If you do not object , I will go on to the house . "
71559	71568	71569	71569	he	1162	" Oh , Mr. Hamel , are you ? "
71574	71578	71569	71569	he	1162	" Isadore Hamel . "
71579	71592	71545	71545	she	266	" You called at Queen 's Gate once , not long ago ? "
71593	71597	71599	71599	Hamel	310	" I did , "
71601	71607	71599	71599	Hamel	310	" but saw no one . "
71608	71667	71545	71545	she	266	" No , you did n't ; I heard that . Well , you can go on to the house if you like , but you had better ask for Lady Tringle . After coming over from Callerfoot you 'll want some lunch . Stop a moment . I do n't mind if I ride back with you . "
71717	71723	71725	71725	Hamel	310	" There is Miss Dormer , "
71727	71735	71725	71725	Hamel	310	" I suppose I may join her ? "
71888	71897	71899	71899	he	310	" You hardly expected to see me here ? "
71901	71906	71899	71899	he	310	" Indeed ; no . "
71907	71921	71879	71880	the man	2044	" Nor did I expect that I should find you in this way . "
71922	71930	71932	71932	Lucy	266	" My uncle knows it is you ? "
71934	71964	71932	71932	Lucy	266	" Oh , yes . I met him as I came up from the ravine , and he has asked me to go on to the house to lunch . "
71979	71998	72016	72016	she	266	" I hope you do not think that I am persecuting you in making my way over here . "
71999	72007	72016	72016	she	266	" Oh , no ; not persecuting ! "
72042	72052	72053	72053	she	266	" Of course I am glad to see you , "
72056	72066	72053	72053	she	266	" for papa 's sake , but I 'm afraid-- "
72067	72075	72076	72076	She	266	" Afraid of what , Miss Dormer ? "
72101	72112	72076	72076	She	266	" My Aunt Emmeline does not want you to come . "
72113	72121	72053	72053	she	266	" Why should she not want me ? "
72122	72193	72076	72076	She	266	" That I can not tell . Perhaps if I did know I should not tell . But it is so . You called at Queen 's Gate , and I know that you were not admitted , though I was at home . Of course , Aunt Emmeline has a right to choose who shall come . It is not as though I had a house of my own . "
72194	72202	72076	72076	She	266	" But Sir Thomas asked me in . "
72203	72229	72053	72053	she	266	" Then you had better go in . After what Aunt Emmeline said , I do not think that you ought to remain with me . "
72230	72239	72241	72241	Hamel	310	" Your uncle knows I am with you , "
72257	72264	72265	72265	he	310	" Do you mean to say , "
72268	72282	72265	72265	he	310	" that because your aunt objects you are never to see me again ? "
72283	72311	72053	72053	she	266	" I hope I shall see you again . You were papa 's friend , and I should be so very sorry not to see you again . "
72312	72316	72317	72317	he	310	" I suppose , "
72322	72334	72317	72317	he	310	" I can never be more than your papa 's friend . "
72335	72341	72053	72053	she	266	" You are mine also . "
72342	72350	72352	72352	he	310	" I would be more than that . "
72370	72382	72352	72352	he	310	" I would be so much more than that , Lucy . "
72436	72441	72442	72442	he	310	" Oh , Lucy , "
72445	72454	72442	72442	he	310	" if you can love me say so . "
72455	72459	72460	72460	she	2715	" Mr. Hamel , "
72463	72466	72442	72442	he	310	" Lucy . "
72467	72503	72442	72442	he	310	" Mr. Hamel , I told you about Aunt Emmeline . She will not allow it . I ought not to have let you speak to me like this , while I am staying here . "
72504	72514	72442	72442	he	310	" But your uncle knows I am with you . "
72515	72540	72442	72442	he	310	" My aunt does not know . We must go to the house . She expressly desired that I would not speak to you . "
72541	72550	72442	72442	he	310	" And you will obey her -- always ? "
72551	72582	72442	72442	he	310	" No ; not always . I did not say that I should obey her always . Some day , perhaps , I shall do as I think fit myself . "
72583	72592	72442	72442	he	310	" And then you will speak to me ? "
72593	72601	72602	72602	she	2716	" Then I will speak to you , "
72605	72610	72602	72602	she	2716	" And love me ? "
72611	72616	72617	72617	she	2716	" And love you , "
72628	72639	72617	72617	she	2716	" But now pray , pray let us go on . "
72815	72819	72820	72820	she	672	" Mr. Hamel ! "
72824	72853	72820	72820	she	672	" Yes , Mr. Hamel . I could not see the man starving when he had come all this way . I do n't know anything against him . "
72930	72956	72921	72921	Lucy	266	" Aunt Emmeline , this is Mr. Hamel . Uncle Tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon . "
73006	73011	73012	73012	she	672	" And love you , "
73066	73076	73078	73079	Lady Tringle	282	" If you will sit there , Mr. Hamel , "
73405	73409	73410	73410	she	282	" Mr. Hamel , "
73415	73422	73410	73410	she	282	" would you like some cheese ? "
73438	73461	73423	73424	Mr. Hamel	310	" Then , my dears , I think we will go into my room . Lucy , will you come with me ? "
73522	73533	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" Are you staying over with Stubbs at that cottage ? "
73539	73547	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" A very queer fellow is Stubbs . "
73548	73554	73556	73556	Hamel	310	" A very good fellow , "
73558	73570	73556	73556	Hamel	310	" I dare say . He has n't got any shooting ? "
73571	73576	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" I think not . "
73577	73596	73556	73556	Hamel	310	" Not a head . Glentower would n't let an acre of shooting over there for any money . "
73620	73638	73599	73602	the Earl of Glentower	2740	" What on earth does he do with himself stuck up on the top of those rocks ? "
73639	73654	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" He does shoot sometimes , I believe , when Lord Glentower is there . "
73655	73672	73674	73676	the Honourable Septimus	2722	" That 's a poor kind of fun , waiting to be asked for a day , "
73688	73695	73674	73676	the Honourable Septimus	2722	" Does he get any fishing ? "
73696	73722	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" He catches a few trout sometimes in the tarns above . But I fancy that Stubbs is n't much devoted to shooting and fishing . "
73723	73740	73741	73741	Hamel	310	" Then what the d---- does he do with himself in such a country as this ? "
73779	73785	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" Is he a Liberal ? "
73786	73790	73792	73792	Hamel	310	" A what ? "
73794	73824	73535	73537	the Honourable Septimus	321	" Oh , a Liberal ? Upon my word I do n't know what he is . He is chiefly given to poetry , tobacco , and military matters . "
73853	73868	73870	73870	Hamel	310	" Sir Thomas , I am very much obliged to you for your kindness , "
73876	73924	73870	73870	Hamel	310	" As it is a long way over to Drumcaller I think I will make a start . I know my way down the Glen and should be sure to miss it by any other route . Perhaps you 'll let me go back as I came . "
74160	74164	74165	74165	she	737	" Aunt Emmeline , "
74168	74177	74165	74165	she	737	" I am engaged to Mr. Hamel now . "
74178	74181	74130	74130	her	737	" What ! "
74182	74196	74130	74130	her	737	" He has asked me to be his wife and I have promised . "
74197	74209	74165	74165	she	737	" And that after all that I had said to you ! "
74210	74301	74130	74130	her	737	" Aunt Emmeline , I told you that I should not drop him . I did not bid him come here . Uncle Tom brought him . When I saw him I would have avoided him if I could . I told him he ought not to be here because you did not wish it ; and then he answered that my uncle knew that he was with me . Of course when he told me that he -- loved me , I could not make him any other answer . "
74333	74345	74347	74348	the Colonel	2361	" And how have you fared on your day 's journey ? "
74366	74379	74347	74348	the Colonel	2361	" Much better than I thought . Sir Thomas gave me luncheon . "
74380	74386	74347	74348	the Colonel	2361	" And the young lady ? "
74387	74439	74347	74348	the Colonel	2361	" The young lady was gracious also ; but I am afraid that I can not carry my praises of the family at Glenbogie any further . The three Tringle ladies looked at me as I was sitting at table as though I certainly had no business in their august society . "
74491	74501	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" You went for the purpose , of course ? "
74506	74512	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" For an off chance ? "
74513	74589	74478	74479	the Colonel	2361	" I know that well enough . I never heard of a man 's walking twelve miles to call upon a young lady merely because he knew her father ; and when there was to be a second call within a few weeks , the first having not been taken in very good part by the young lady 's friends , my inquiring mind told me that there was something more than old family friendship . "
74590	74599	74478	74479	the Colonel	2361	" Your inquiring mind saw into the truth . "
74600	74617	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" And now looks forward to further events . Can she bake and can she brew ? "
74618	74630	74478	74479	the Colonel	2361	" I do not doubt that she could if she tried . "
74631	74691	74478	74479	the Colonel	2361	" And can she wash a shirt for a man ? Do n't suppose , my dear fellow , that I intend to say that your wife will have to wash yours . Washing a shirt , as read in the poem from which I am quoting , is presumed to be simply emblematic of household duties in general . "
74692	74706	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" I take all you say in good part,--as coming from a friend . "
74707	74712	74714	74715	the Colonel	2361	" I regard matrimony , "
74717	74914	74714	74715	the Colonel	2361	" as being altogether the happiest state of life for a man,--unless to be engaged to some lovely creature , in whom one can have perfect confidence , may be a thought happier . One can enjoy all the ecstatic mental reflection , all the delights of conceit which come from being loved , that feeling of superiority to all the world around which illumines the bosom of the favoured lover , without having to put one 's hand into one 's pocket , or having one 's pipe put out either morally or physically . The next to this is matrimony itself , which is the only remedy for that consciousness of disreputable debauchery , a savour of which always clings , more or less strongly , to unmarried men in our rank of life . The chimes must be heard at midnight , let a young man be ever so well given to the proprieties , and he must have just a touch of the swingebuckler about him , or he will seem to himself to be deficient in virility . There is no getting out of it until a man marry . But then-- "
74915	74920	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" Well ; then ? "
74921	75034	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" Do you know the man whose long - preserved hat is always brushed carefully , whose coat is the pattern of neatness , but still a little threadbare when you look at it,--in the colour of whose cheek there is still some touch of juvenility , but whose step is ever heavy and whose brow is always sad ? The seriousness of life has pressed the smiles out of him . He has learned hardly to want anything for himself but outward decency and the common necessaries of life . Such little personal indulgences as are common to you and to me are as strange to him as ortolans or diamonds . "
75035	75045	74714	74715	the Colonel	2361	" I do not think I do know him . "
75046	75179	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" I do;--well . I have seen him in the regiment , I have met him on the steps of a public office , I have watched him as he entered his parsonage house . You shall find him coming out of a lawyer 's office , where he has sat for the last nine hours , having supported nature with two penny biscuits . He has always those few thin hairs over his forehead , he has always that well - brushed hat , he has always that load of care on his brow . He is generally thinking whether he shall endeavour to extend his credit with the butcher , or resolve that the supply of meat may be again curtailed without injury to the health of his five daughters . "
75180	75187	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" That is an ugly picture . "
75188	75194	74714	74715	the Colonel	2361	" But is it true ? "
75195	75206	74503	74504	the Colonel	2361	" In some cases , of course , it is . "
75207	75215	75217	75226	the meditative Colonel , who had just replenished his pipe	2764	" And yet not ugly all round , "
75228	75339	75225	75225	his	2764	" There are , on the other side , the five daughters , and the partner of this load of cares . He knows it is well to have the five daughters , rather than to live with plenty of beef and mutton,--even with the ortolans if you will,--and with no one to care whether his body may be racked in this world or his spirit in the next . I do not say whether the balance of good or evil be on one side or the other ; but when a man is going to do a thing he should know what it is he is going to do . "
75340	75347	75349	75349	Hamel	310	" The reading of all this , "
75351	75379	75349	75349	Hamel	310	" is , that if I succeed in marrying Miss Dormer I must have thin locks , and a bad hat , and a butcher 's bill . "
75380	75385	75225	75225	his	2764	" Other men do . "
75386	75418	75225	75225	his	2764	" Some , instead , have balances at their bankers , and die worth thirty , forty , or fifty thousand pounds , to the great consolation of the five daughters . "
75419	75480	75349	75349	Hamel	310	" Or a hundred thousand pounds ! There is , of course , no end to the amount of thousands which a successful professional man may accumulate . You may be the man ; but the question is , whether you should not have reasonable ground to suppose yourself the man , before you encumber yourself with the five daughters . "
75481	75487	75489	75489	Hamel	310	" It seems to me , "
75491	75501	75489	75489	Hamel	310	" that the need of such assurance is cowardly . "
75502	75644	75349	75349	Hamel	310	" That is just the question which I am always debating with myself . I also want to rid myself of that swingebuckler flavour . I feel that for me , like Adam , it is not good that I should be alone . I would fain ask the first girl , that I could love well enough to wish to make myself one with her , to be my wife , regardless of hats , butchers , and daughters . It is a plucky and a fine thing for a man to feel that he can make his back broad enough for all burdens . But yet what is the good of thinking that you can carry a sack of wheat when you are sure that you have not , in truth , strength to raise it from the ground ? "
75645	75650	75652	75652	Hamel	310	" Strength will come , "
75654	75708	75652	75652	Hamel	310	" Yes , and the bad hat . And , worse than the bad hat , the soiled gown ; and perhaps with the soiled gown the altered heart;--and perhaps with the altered heart an absence of all that tenderness which it is a woman 's special right to expect from a man . "
75709	75727	75349	75349	Hamel	310	" I should have thought you would have been the last to be so self - diffident . "
75728	75737	75739	75740	the Colonel	2361	" To be so thoughtful , you mean , "
75742	75810	75739	75740	the Colonel	2361	" I am unattached now , and having had no special duty for the last three months I have given myself over to thinking in a nasty morbid manner . It comes , I daresay , partly from tobacco . But there is comfort in this,--that no such reflections falling out of one man 's mouth ever had the slightest effect in influencing another man 's conduct . "
76112	76121	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" What a beast you are to go , "
76126	76138	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" when there can be no possible reason for your going . "
76139	76160	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" The five daughters and the bad hat make it necessary that a fellow should do a little work sometimes . "
76161	76172	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" Why ca n't you make your images down here ? "
76173	76189	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" With you for a model , and mud out of the Caller for clay . "
76190	76268	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" I should n't have the slightest objection . In your art you can not perpetuate the atrocity of my colour , as the fellow did who painted my portrait last winter . If you will go , go , and make busts at unheard - of prices , so that the five daughters may live for ever on the fat of the land . Can I do any good for you by going over to Glenbogie ? "
76269	76287	76123	76124	the Colonel	2361	" If you could snub that Mr. Traffick , who is of all men the most atrocious . "
76288	76295	76297	76298	the Colonel	2361	" The power does n't exist , "
76300	76434	76297	76298	the Colonel	2361	" which could snub the Honourable Septimus . That man is possessed of a strength which I thoroughly envy,--which is perhaps more enviable than any other gift the gods can give . Words can not penetrate that skin of his . Satire flows off him like water from a duck . Ridicule does not touch him . The fellest abuse does not succeed in inflicting the slightest wound . He has learnt the great secret that a man can not be cut who will not be cut . As it is worth no man 's while to protract an enmity with such a one as he , he suffers from no prolonged enmities . He walks unassailable by any darts , and is , I should say , the happiest man in London . "
76435	76478	76537	76537	Drumcaller	91	" Then I fear you can do nothing for me at Glenbogie . To mollify Aunt Emmeline would , I fear , be beyond your power . Sir Thomas , as far as I can see , does not require much mollifying . "
76479	76492	76297	76298	the Colonel	2361	" Sir Thomas might give the young woman a thousand or two . "
76493	76512	76514	76514	Hamel	310	" That is not the way in which I desire to keep a good hat on my head , "
76963	76968	76970	76971	Sir Harry	415	" Oh , Stubbs ! "
76973	76988	76970	76971	Sir Harry	415	" Stubbs is one of those fellows who never come if they 're asked . "
78614	78621	78622	78622	she	287	" I hate mutton - bones , "
78634	78646	78622	78622	she	287	" No doubt we would all like meat joints the best , "
78653	78659	78622	78622	she	287	" I hate joints too . "
78660	78679	78622	78622	she	287	" You have , I dare say , been cockered up at the Marchesa 's with made dishes . "
78680	78685	78687	78687	Ayala	287	" I hate dishes , "
78691	78698	78687	78687	Ayala	287	" You do n't hate eating ? "
78699	78761	78622	78622	she	287	" Yes , I do . It is ignoble . Nature should have managed it differently . We ought to have sucked it in from the atmosphere through our fingers and hairs , as the trees do by their leaves . There should have been no butchers , and no grease , and no nasty smells from the kitchen,--and no gin . "
78786	78799	78801	78802	Aunt Margaret	285	" You are flying in the face of the Creator , Miss , "
78808	78832	78805	78805	her	285	voice,--"in the face of the Creator who made everything , and ordained what his creatures should eat and drink by His infinite wisdom . "
78833	78836	78838	78838	Ayala	287	" Nevertheless , "
78840	78851	78838	78838	Ayala	287	" I think we might have done without boiled mutton . "
79035	79048	79050	79051	Uncle Reginald	292	" I think that a little amusement is good for young people , "
79055	79189	79050	79051	Uncle Reginald	292	" And for old people too . No doubt about it , if they can get it so as not to do them any harm at the same time . Nothing can be good for a young woman which unfits her for that state of life to which it has pleased God to call her . Ayala has to live with us . No doubt there was a struggle when she first came from your sister , Lady Tringle , but she made it gallantly , and I gave her great credit . She was just falling into a quiet mode of life when there came this invitation from the Marchesa Baldoni . Now she has come back quite an altered person , and the struggle has to be made all over again . "
79487	79490	79491	79491	she	287	" Aunt , "
79494	79504	79491	79491	she	287	" you have had a letter from Lady Albury ? "
79505	79508	79510	79511	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Yes , "
79515	79525	79510	79511	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I have had a letter from Lady Albury . "
79549	79553	79554	79554	she	287	" Aunt Margaret , "
79557	79567	79554	79554	she	287	" I hope you mean to let me go . "
79585	79595	79579	79579	Ayala	287	" Lady Albury wants me to go to Stalham . "
79596	79610	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" She has written to me to say that she would receive you . "
79611	79617	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" And I may go ? "
79618	79630	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I am strongly of opinion that you had better not , "
79647	79656	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Oh , Aunt Margaret , why not ? "
79657	79668	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I think it would be most prudent to decline . "
79669	79676	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" But why,--why,--why , Aunt Margaret ? "
79677	79683	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" There must be expense . "
79684	79703	79705	79705	Ayala	287	" I have money enough for the journey left of my own from what Uncle Tom gave me , "
79715	79730	79712	79712	her	287	" It is not only the money . There are other reasons,--very strong reasons . "
79731	79738	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" What reasons , Aunt Margaret ? "
79739	79767	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" My dear , it is your lot to have to live with us , and not with such people as the Marchesa Baldoni and Lady Albury . "
79768	79777	79712	79712	her	287	" I am sure I do not complain . "
79778	79818	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" But you would complain after having for a time been used to the luxuries of Albury Park . I do not say that as finding fault , Ayala . It is human nature that it should be so . "
79819	79831	79632	79633	Mrs. Dosett	285	" But I wo n't complain . Have I ever complained ? "
79832	79924	79712	79712	her	287	" Yes , my dear . You told me the other day that you did not like bones of mutton , and you were disgusted because things were greasy . I do not say this by way of scolding you , Ayala , but only that you may understand what must be the effect of your going from such a house as this to such a house as Stalham , and then returning back from Stalham to such a house as this . You had better be contented with your position . "
79925	79933	79935	79935	Ayala	287	" I am contented with my position , "
79937	79950	79935	79935	Ayala	287	" And allow me to write to Lady Albury refusing the invitation . "
80459	80470	80471	80471	she	287	" I think I ought to be allowed to go , "
80484	80495	80471	80471	she	287	" When I think it will be bad for you ? "
80496	80520	80471	80471	she	287	" It wo n't be bad . They are very good people . I think that I ought to be allowed to go . "
80521	80534	80471	80471	she	287	" Have you no reliance on those who are your natural guardians ? "
80535	80543	80545	80545	Ayala	287	" Uncle Reginald is my natural guardian , "
80551	80639	80545	80545	Ayala	287	" Very well ! If you refuse to be guided by me as though I were not your aunt , and as you will pay no attention to what I tell you is proper for you and best , the question must be left till your uncle comes home . I can not but be very much hurt that you should think so little of me . I have always endeavoured to do the best I could for you , just as though I were your mother . "
80640	80652	80654	80654	Ayala	287	" I think that I ought to be allowed to go , "
80921	80928	80930	80931	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I wo n't have it , "
80948	81099	80930	80931	Mrs. Dosett	285	" If I am to be responsible for the girl I must be allowed my own way with her . It is trouble enough , and very little thanks I get for it . Of course she hates me . Nevertheless , I can endeavour to do my duty , and I will . It is not thanks , nor love , nor even gratitude , that I look for . I am bound to do the best I can by her because she is your niece , and because she has no other real friends . I knew what would come of it when she went to that house in Brook Street . I was soft then and gave way . The girl has moped about like a miserable creature ever since . If I am not to have my way now I will have done with her altogether . "
81377	81380	81381	81381	he	734	" Ayala , "
81384	81415	81381	81381	he	734	" your aunt and I have been talking over this invitation to Stalham , and we are of opinion , my dear , that you had better not accept it . "
81416	81423	81360	81360	his	734	" Why not , Uncle Reginald ? "
81424	81430	81360	81360	his	734	" There would be expense . "
81431	81440	81381	81381	he	734	" I can pay for my own ticket . "
81441	81484	81360	81360	his	734	" There would be many expenses , which I need not explain to you more fully . The truth is , my dear , that poor people can not afford to live with rich people , and had better not attempt it . "
81485	81495	81360	81360	his	734	" I do n't want to live with them . "
81496	81572	81381	81381	he	734	" Visiting them is living with them for a time . I am sorry , Ayala , that we are not able to put you in a position in which you might enjoy more of the pleasures incidental to your age ; but you must take the things as they are . Looking at the matter all round , I am sure that your aunt is right in advising that you should stay at home . "
81573	81581	81583	81583	Ayala	287	" It is n't advice at all , "
81585	81588	81590	81591	her aunt	737	" Ayala ! "
81599	81605	81607	81607	Ayala	287	" It is n't advice , "
81609	81625	81607	81607	Ayala	287	" Of course , if you wo n't let me go , I ca n't . "
81626	81634	81636	81637	Mrs. Dosett	285	" You are a very wicked girl , "
81639	81657	81636	81637	Mrs. Dosett	285	" to speak to your uncle like that , after all that he has done for you . "
81658	81662	81664	81665	the uncle	1830	" Not wicked , "
81667	81706	81664	81665	the uncle	1830	" I say , wicked . But it does n't matter . I shall at once write to Lady Albury , as you desire , and of course there will be no further question as to her going . "
83070	83080	83081	83081	he	385	" I am not an Adonis , I know , "
83084	83141	83081	83081	he	385	" nor do I look like a Lothario , but still I am in some sort a young man , and therefore certain to be regarded as pernicious , as dangerous and damnable , by such a dragon of virtue as Aunt Dosett . I do n't see how I could expect to have a chance . "
83195	83206	83208	83209	Lady Albury	413	" I do n't think I could stand Mrs. D. , "
83261	83266	83267	83267	She	413	" a little fast . "
83484	83488	83489	83489	she	413	" Mr. Dosett , "
83492	83514	83489	83489	she	413	" I have taken the great liberty of calling to say a few words about your niece , Miss Ayala Dormer . "
83569	83575	83576	83576	he	270	" You were kind enough , "
83579	83592	83576	83576	he	270	" to invite my little girl to your house some weeks ago . "
83593	83604	83605	83606	Mr. Dosett	270	" And now I have come to invite her again . "
83706	83715	83716	83716	he	270	" You are very kind , Lady Albury , "
83719	83736	83738	83739	the lady	2267	" We particularly wish to have her about the end of the first week in November , "
83741	83773	83738	83739	the lady	2267	" Her friend Nina Baldoni will be there , and one or two others whom she knows . We shall try to be a little gay for a week or two . "
83774	83792	83838	83838	he	270	" I have no doubt it would be gay , and we at home are very dull . "
83793	83806	83808	83809	her ladyship	2738	" Do you not think a little gaiety good for young people ? "
83830	83837	83838	83838	he	270	" Yes ; a little gaiety , "
83857	83863	83865	83866	Lady Albury	413	" Of course you do , "
83868	83923	83865	83866	Lady Albury	413	" Poor little girl ! I have heard so much about her , and of all your goodness to her . Mrs. Dosett I know is another mother to her ; but still a little country air could not but be beneficial . Do say that she shall come to us , Mr. Dosett . "
84088	84096	84097	84097	she	413	" You musn't be angry with me , "
84100	84125	84097	84097	she	413	" if I do n't quite agree with you . Of course you wish to do the best you can for this dear child . "
84126	84134	84075	84076	Lady Albury	413	" Indeed I do , Lady Albury . "
84135	84167	84097	84097	she	413	" How is anything then to be done for her if she remains shut up in your house ? You do not , if I understand , see much company yourselves . "
84168	84173	84097	84097	she	413	" None at all . "
84174	84190	84075	84076	Lady Albury	413	" You wo n't be angry with me for my impertinence in alluding to it . "
84191	84208	84097	84097	she	413	" Not in the least . It is the fact that we live altogether to ourselves . "
84209	84221	84223	84224	Lady Albury	413	" And the happiest kind of life too for married people , "
84256	84280	84097	84097	she	413	" But for young people it is not quite so good . How is a young lady to get herself settled in life ? "
84281	84284	84286	84287	Mr. Dosett	270	" Settled ? "
84291	84294	84296	84297	Lady Albury	413	" Married , "
84382	84470	84378	84378	his	270	" In fact how is a girl to have a chance at all unless she is allowed to see some one ? Of course I do n't say this with reference to our house . There will be no young men there , or anything of that kind . But , taking a broad view , unless you let a girl like that have what chances come in her way how is she to get on ? I think you have hardly a right to do it . "
84471	84480	84344	84345	a husband	7377	" We have done it for the best . "
84481	84537	84378	84378	his	270	" I am sure of that , Mr. Dosett . And I hope you will tell Mrs. Dosett , with my compliments , how thoroughly I appreciate her goodness . I should have called upon her instead of coming here , only that I can not very well get into that part of the town . "
84538	84551	84378	84378	his	270	" I will tell her what you are good enough to say . "
84552	84604	84344	84345	a husband	7377	" Poor Ayala ! I am afraid that her other aunt , Aunt Tringle , was not as good to her as your wife . I have heard about how all that occurred in Rome . She was very much admired there . I am told that she is perfectly lovely . "
84605	84609	84378	84378	his	270	" Pretty well . "
84610	84626	84378	84378	his	270	" A sort of beauty that we hardly ever see now,--and very , very clever . "
84627	84635	84344	84345	a husband	7377	" Ayala is clever , I think . "
84636	84705	84378	84378	his	270	" She ought to have her chance . She ought indeed . I do n't think you quite do your duty by such a girl as that unless you let her have a chance . She is sure to get to know people , and to be asked from one house to another . I speak plainly , for I really think you ought to let her come . "
85682	85714	85675	85675	she	3057	" I have had that Lady Albury with me at the office to - day , and have almost promised that Ayala shall go to her on the 8th of November . "
85740	85744	85730	85730	he	270	" You have ? "
85745	85779	85821	85822	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Well , my dear , I almost did . She said a great deal , and I could not but agree with much of it . Ayala ought to have her chances . "
85780	85784	85786	85787	Mrs. Dosett	285	" What chances ? "
85798	85810	85786	85787	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Well ; seeing people . She never sees anybody here . "
85811	85819	85821	85822	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Nobody is better than some people , "
85835	85843	85845	85846	Mr. Dosett	270	" But if a girl sees nobody , "
85848	85855	85845	85846	Mr. Dosett	270	" she can have no,--no,--no chances . "
85856	85865	85867	85868	Mrs. Dosett	285	" She has the chance of wholesome victuals , "
85870	85886	85867	85868	Mrs. Dosett	285	" and I do n't know what other chances you or I can give her . "
85887	85896	85897	85899	This Mr. Dosett	270	" She might see -- a young man . "
85904	85976	85897	85899	This Mr. Dosett	270	" A young fiddlestick ! A young man ! Young men should be waited for till they come naturally , and never thought about if they do n't come at all . I hate this looking after young men . If there was n't a young man for the next dozen years we should do better,--so as just to get out of the way of thinking about them for a time . "
86060	86063	86065	86065	Ayala	287	" What ! "
86072	86079	86081	86082	Mr. Dosett	270	" On the eighth of November , "
86084	86088	86081	86082	Mr. Dosett	270	" To Stalham ? "
86089	86106	86127	86127	his	270	" Lady Albury was with me yesterday at the office , and your aunt has consented . "
86107	86113	86115	86115	Ayala	287	" Oh , Uncle Reginald ! "
86139	86146	86148	86148	Ayala	287	" I 'll never forget it , "
86156	86158	86127	86127	his	270	aunt,--"never . "
86159	86171	86189	86189	She	287	" I only hope it may not do you a mischief . "
86172	86188	86189	86189	She	287	" And I beg your pardon , Aunt Margaret , because I was,--I was,--because I was-- "
86209	86223	86228	86228	her	287	admit,--"too self - asserting , considering that I am only a young girl . "
86237	86247	86249	86250	Aunt Margaret	285	" We need not go back to that now , "
86272	86276	86267	86268	ANTHONY TROLLOPE	264	" Doctor Thorne , "
86277	86282	86256	86256	I.	3065	" The Prime Minister , "

86434	86443	86454	86455	TOM TRINGLE	271	" I NEVER THREATENED TO TURN YOU OUT . "
86488	86493	86454	86455	TOM TRINGLE	271	" A COLD PROSPECT ! "
86578	86589	86591	86592	Lady Tringle	282	" I think it very wrong of my poor brother , "
86594	86607	86591	86592	Lady Tringle	282	" She ca n't have a shilling even to get herself gloves . "
86979	86990	86992	86993	the Colonel	2361	" Are you going to make one of my team ? "
87033	87037	87039	87039	Ayala	287	" What team ? "
87195	87229	87238	87238	he	2361	" My pony team . I mean to drive too . You must n't think that I am taking a liberty when I say that they are to be called Nina and Ayala . "
87294	87300	87301	87301	she	287	" If it 's riding , "
87305	87315	87301	87301	she	287	" I ca n't be one of the ponies . "
87316	87340	87279	87279	he	2361	" It is riding,--of course . Now the Marchesa is not here , we mean to call it hunting in a mild way . "
87341	87346	87347	87347	she	287	" I ca n't , "
87350	87362	87347	87347	she	287	" But you 've got to do it , Miss Dormer . "
87363	87384	87279	87279	he	2361	" I have n't got anything to do it with . Of course , I do n't mind telling you . "
87385	87445	87279	87279	he	2361	" You are to ride the sweetest little horse that ever was foaled,--just bigger than a pony . It belongs to Sir Harry 's sister who is away , and we 've settled it all . There never was a safer little beast , and he can climb through a fence without letting you know that it 's there . "
87446	87453	87455	87455	Ayala	287	" But I mean -- clothes , "
87461	87477	87458	87458	she	287	" I have n't got a habit , or anything else anybody ought to have . "
87478	87481	87483	87484	the Colonel	2361	" Ah , "
87486	87566	87483	87484	the Colonel	2361	" I do n't know anything about that . I should say that Nina must have managed that . The horse department was left to me , and I have done my part . You will find that you will have to go out next Tuesday and Friday . The hounds will be here on Tuesday , and they will be at Rufford on Friday . Rufford is only nine miles from here , and it 's all settled . "
87868	87874	87876	87876	Tony	433	" Darm their nasty ways , "
87893	87938	87878	87880	Mr. Larry Twentyman	434	" they runs one a top of anothers brushes , till there ai n't a ' ound living knows t'other from which . There 's always a many on 'em at Albury , but I never knew an Albury fox worth his grub yet . "
88156	88169	88170	88171	Sir Harry	415	" Pringle 's Gorse is not just the place for young ladies , "
88220	88231	88233	88234	the Colonel	2361	" About six miles straight on end in forty minutes , "
88236	88245	88233	88234	the Colonel	2361	" and then a kill in the open . "
88246	88255	88257	88258	young Gosling	437	" He was laid up under a bank , "
88260	88274	88276	88277	Captain Batsby	290	" He was so beat he could n't carry on a field farther , "
88286	88293	88295	88295	Stubbs	385	" I call that the open , "
88297	88309	88311	88312	Sir Harry	415	" I always think I kill a fox in the open , "
88314	88336	88311	88312	Sir Harry	415	" when the hounds run into him , because he can not run another yard with the country there before him . "
88356	88359	88311	88312	Sir Harry	415	" the open "
88563	88576	88578	88579	Captain Batsby	290	" I know you 'll go like a bird to - morrow , "
88581	88595	88597	88597	Ayala	287	" I should n't like that , because there would be no jumping , "
88599	88609	88610	88611	The Captain	3130	" But you 'd be such a beautiful bird . "
88638	88650	88651	88651	she	287	" At what time are we to start to - morrow ? "
88659	88695	88651	88651	she	287	" Ten , sharp . Mind you 're ready . Sir Harry takes us on the drag , and would n't wait for Venus , though she wanted five minutes more for her back hair . "
88696	88720	88627	88627	she	287	" I do n't suppose she ever wants any time for her back hair . I would n't if I were a goddess . "
88721	88742	88627	88627	she	287	" Then you 'd be a very untidy goddess , that 's all . I wonder whether you are untidy . "
88743	88746	88651	88651	she	287	" Well;--yes;--sometimes . "
88747	88753	88627	88627	she	287	" I hate untidy girls . "
88754	88761	88627	88627	she	287	" Thank you , Colonel Stubbs . "
88762	88815	88651	88651	she	287	" What I like is a nice prim little woman , who never had a pin in the wrong place in her life . Her cuffs and collars are always as stiff as steel , and she never rubs the sleeves of her dresses by leaning about , like some young ladies . "
88816	88823	88651	88651	she	287	" That 's what I do . "
88824	88874	88627	88627	she	287	" My young woman never sits down lest she should crease her dress . My young woman never lets her ribbons get tangled . My young woman can dress upon £ 40 a - year , and always look as though she came out of a band - box . "
88875	88890	88651	88651	she	287	" I do n't believe you 've got a young woman , Colonel Stubbs . "
88891	88902	88651	88651	she	287	" Well ; no ; I haven't,--except in my imagination . "
88915	88923	88910	88910	his	3133	" Do you ever dream about her ? "
88924	89012	88627	88627	she	287	" Oh dear , yes . I dream that she does scold so awfully when I have her to myself . In my dreams , you know , I 'm married to her , and she always wants me to eat hashed mutton . Now , if there is one thing that makes me more sick than another it is hashed mutton . Of course I shall marry her in some of my waking moments , and then I shall have to eat hashed mutton for ever . "
89021	89038	89014	89015	Captain Batsby	290	" I should so like to be allowed to give you a lead to - morrow . "
89039	89051	89053	89053	Ayala	287	" Oh , thank you,--but I 'd rather not have it , "
89064	89067	89014	89015	Captain Batsby	290	" a lead "
89083	89101	89014	89015	Captain Batsby	290	" I mean that I should like to show you a line if we get a run . "
89102	89108	89110	89110	Ayala	287	" What is a line ? "
89112	89142	89110	89110	Ayala	287	" A line ? Why a line is just a lead;--keep your eye on me and I 'll take the fences where you can follow without coming to grief . "
89143	89146	89148	89148	Ayala	287	" Oh , "
89150	89178	89148	89148	Ayala	287	" that 's a lead is it ? Colonel Stubbs is going to give my friend and me a lead , as long as we stay here . "
89179	89193	89195	89196	the Captain	3130	" No man ever ought to coach more than one lady at once , "
89202	89218	89199	89199	his	3130	" You 're sure to come on top of one another if there are two . "
89219	89236	89238	89238	Ayala	287	" But Colonel Stubbs is especially told by the Marchesa to look after both of us , "
89525	89533	89535	89535	Tony	433	" Oh , yes , my Lord , "
89537	89562	89535	89535	Tony	433	" there 'll sure to be a fox at Dillsborough . But we 'll find one afore we get to Rufford , my Lord . "
89563	89581	89593	89593	Tony	433	" Lady Rufford says there has n't been a fox seen in the home woods this week . "
89582	89591	89593	89593	Tony	433	" Her ladyship will be sure to know , "
89595	89612	89614	89615	the Lord	3155	" Do you remember that fence where poor Major Caneback got his fall six years ago ? "
89617	89626	89628	89628	Tony	433	" Seven years next Christmas , my Lord , "
89630	89744	89628	89628	Tony	433	" He never put a leg across a saddle again , poor fellow ! I remember him well , my Lord ; a man who could ' andle a ' orse wonderful , though he did n't know ' ow to ride to ' ounds ; not according to my idea . To get your animal to carry you through , never mind ' ow long the thing is ; that 's my idea of riding to ' ounds , my Lord . The major was for always making a ' orse jump over everything . I never wants 'em to jump over nothing I ca n't help;--I do n't , my Lord . "
89745	89758	89760	89761	Lord Rufford	439	" That 's just what her ladyship is always saying to me , "
89763	89775	89760	89761	Lord Rufford	439	" and I do pretty much what her ladyship tells me . "
89843	89849	89851	89852	the Colonel	2361	" Whenever I see Rufford , "
89854	89863	89851	89852	the Colonel	2361	" he does me a world of good . "
89864	89877	89879	89879	Nina	426	" What good can a fat man like that do to you ? "
89881	89906	89879	89879	Nina	426	" He is a continual sermon against marriage . If I could see Rufford once a week I know that I should be safe . "
89907	89920	89922	89922	Ayala	287	" He seems to me to be a very comfortable old gentleman , "
89924	89973	89922	89922	Ayala	287	" Old ! Seven years ago he was acknowledged to be the one undisputed paragon of a young man in this county . No one else dreamed of looking at a young lady if he chose to turn his eyes in that direction . He was handsome as Apollo-- "
89974	89979	89981	89981	Nina	426	" He an Apollo ! "
89983	90026	89981	89981	Nina	426	" The best Apollo there then was in these parts , and every one knew that he had forty thousand a - year to spend . Now he is supposed to be the best hand in the house at rocking the cradle . "
90027	90039	90041	90041	Ayala	287	" Do you mean to say that he nurses the babies ? "
90043	90134	90136	90136	he	3161	" He looks as if he did at any rate . He never goes ten miles away from his door without having Lady Rufford with him , and is always tucked up at night just at half - past ten by her ladyship 's own maid . Ten years ago he would generally have been found at midnight with cards in his hand and a cigar in his mouth . Now he is allowed two cigarettes a - day . Well , Mr. Twentyman , how are you getting on ? "
90165	90228	90136	90136	he	3161	" Thank ye , Colonel , pretty well , considering how hard the times are . A man who owns a few acres and tries to farm them must be on the road to ruin now - a - days . That 's what I 'm always telling my wife , so that she may know what she has got to expect . "
90238	90248	90250	90251	the Colonel	2361	" She is n't much frightened , I daresay , "
90253	90261	90263	90264	the farmer	3164	" She 's young , you see , "
90266	90280	90263	90264	the farmer	3164	" and has n't settled herself down yet to the sorrows of life . "
90317	90322	90324	90324	Twentyman	434	" By the holy , "
90328	90341	90324	90324	Twentyman	434	" the hounds have put a fox out of that little spinney . "
90535	90542	90543	90543	he	434	" Half a moment , Colonel , "
90575	90580	90581	90581	He	434	" Half a moment ! "
90619	90632	90633	90633	he	434	" I wish Fred Botsey 's tongue were tied to his teeth , "
90639	90699	90633	90633	he	434	" Now , Colonel , they have it . There 's a little lane to the right , and a gate . After that the country 's open , and there 's nothing which the ladies ' nags ca n't do . I know the country so well , you 'd perhaps better come with me for a bit . "
90700	90707	90709	90710	the Colonel	2361	" He knows all about it , "
90714	90721	90709	90710	the Colonel	2361	" Do as he tells you . "
90808	90816	90817	90817	he	433	" D---- their pig - headed folly , "
90827	90877	90879	90879	he	433	Twentyman--"they knows no more about it than if they 'd just come from be'ind a counter,--'olloaing , ' olloaing , ' olloaing,--as if ' olloaing'd make a fox break ! ' Owsomever ' e 's off now , and they 've got Cranbury Brook between them and his line ! "
91268	91274	91276	91276	Twentyman	434	" Now , young ladies , "
91278	91304	91276	91276	Twentyman	434	" give them their heads , and let them do it just as they please,--alongside of each other , and not too near to me . "
91467	91473	91475	91475	Twentyman	434	" Bravo ! young ladies , "
91477	91486	91488	91488	Ayala	287	" Oh , Nina , that is divine , "
91588	91594	91604	91605	Larry Twentyman	434	" the devil take the hindmost "
92109	92119	92121	92122	Sir Harry	415	" I never saw such riding in my life , "
92459	92480	92482	92483	the Colonel	2361	" I never mean to put on a pair of top - boots again , as long as I live , "
92531	92538	92540	92540	Larry	434	" Give up top - boots ? "
92542	92555	92540	92540	Larry	434	" You do n't mean to say you 'll ride in black ! "
92556	92601	92521	92522	the Colonel	2361	" Top - boots , black boots , spurs , breeches , and red coat , I renounce them all from this moment . If ever I 'm seen in a hunting field again it will be in a pair of trousers with overalls . "
92602	92611	92613	92613	Larry	434	" Now , you 're joking , Colonel , "
92615	92627	92629	92629	Ayala	287	" Why wo n't you wear a red coat any more ? "
92631	92678	92629	92629	Ayala	287	" Because I 'm disgraced for ever . I came out to coach two young women , and give them a lead , and all I 've done was to tumble into a brook , while a better man has taken my charge away from me . "
92679	92689	92691	92691	Nina	426	" Oh , Jonathan , I am so sorry , "
92693	92702	92691	92691	Nina	426	" particularly about your getting into the water . "
92703	92715	92717	92717	Ayala	287	" Oh , Colonel Stubbs , we ought to have stopped , "
92719	92734	92736	92737	the Colonel	2361	" It was my only comfort to see how very little I was wanted , "
92739	92762	92736	92737	the Colonel	2361	" If I had broke my neck instead of wetting my feet it would have been just the same to some people . "
92763	92768	92770	92770	Nina	426	" Oh , Jonathan ! "
92775	92790	92792	92792	Ayala	287	" We ought to have stopped . I know we ought to have stopped , "
92797	92807	92809	92809	Twentyman	434	" Nobody ever stops for any one out hunting , "
92817	92823	92825	92826	Captain Batsby	290	" I should think not , "
92839	92859	92861	92861	Larry	434	" I am sure the Colonel will not be angry with me because I took the young ladies on , "
92863	92871	92873	92874	the Colonel	2361	" The Colonel is such a muff , "
92877	92938	92875	92875	himself	2361	" that he will never presume to be angry with anybody again . But if my cousin and Miss Dormer are not very much obliged to you for what you have done for them there will be nothing of gratitude left in the female British bosom . You have probably given to them the most triumphant moment of their existence . "
92939	92956	92875	92875	himself	2361	" It was their own riding , Colonel ; I had nothing to do with it . "
92957	92968	92970	92970	Nina	426	" I am so much obliged to you , Sir , "
92972	92978	92980	92980	Ayala	287	" And so am I , "
92982	92997	92980	92980	Ayala	287	" though it was such a pity that Colonel Stubbs got into the water . "
93029	93035	93037	93037	Ayala	287	" Is it all over ? "
93070	93078	93080	93080	Larry	434	" It 's all over for him , "
93082	93113	93080	93080	Larry	434	" A good fox he was , but he 'll never run again . He is one of them bred at Littlecotes . The foxes bred at Littlecotes always run . "
93114	93120	93122	93122	Nina	426	" And is he dead ? "
93124	93138	93122	93122	Nina	426	" Poor fellow ! I wish it was n't necessary to kill them . "
93171	93183	93185	93186	Larry Twentyman	434	" I call that a pretty little run , Sir Harry , "
93188	93192	93194	93195	Sir Harry	415	" Pretty well , "
93197	93222	93194	93195	Sir Harry	415	" the pace was n't very great , or that pony of mine which Miss Dormer is riding could not have lived with it . "
93223	93299	93315	93315	he	434	" Horses , Sir Harry , do n't want so much pace , if they are allowed to go straight . It 's when a man does n't get well away , or has made a mess with his fences , that he needs an extra allowance of pace to catch the hounds . If you 're once with them and can go straight you may keep your place without such a deal of legs . "
93317	93325	93315	93315	he	434	" made a mess with his fences , "
93333	93340	93342	93342	Larry	434	" And now , young ladies , "
93344	93372	93342	93342	Larry	434	" I hope you 'll come in and see my missus and her baby , and have a little bit of lunch , such as it is . "
93642	93655	93657	93659	the young mother	3281	" Now , Larry , what sort of a run was it ? "
93661	93675	93657	93659	the young mother	3281	" Where did you find him , and what line did he take ? "
93676	93701	93703	93703	he	2361	" I 'll tell you all about it when I come back ; there are two young ladies for you now to look after . "
93717	93750	93703	93703	he	2361	" The little fellow is only six weeks old , and yet she wanted to come to the meet . She 'd have been riding to hounds if I 'd let her . "
93751	93755	93757	93758	Mrs. Twentyman	448	" Why not ? "
93760	93778	93757	93758	Mrs. Twentyman	448	" At any rate I might have gone in the pony carriage and had baby with me . "
93779	93785	93787	93787	Nina	426	" Only six weeks old ! "
93796	93802	93804	93804	Ayala	287	" He is a darling ! "
93806	93817	93804	93804	Ayala	287	" I hope he 'll go out hunting some day . "
93818	93836	93838	93839	Mrs. Twentyman	448	" He 'll want to go six times a week if he 's anything like his father , "
93841	93852	93854	93854	Larry	434	" And seven times if he 's like his mother , "
94116	94126	94129	94131	the present writer	3298	" Always to excel and to go ahead of everybody "
94177	94189	94190	94190	he	434	" I do so hope you 've enjoyed yourself , Ayala ! "
94201	94207	94209	94209	Ayala	287	" Indeed,--indeed , I have ! "
94220	94236	94209	94209	Ayala	287	" I have been so happy , and I am so much obliged to you ! "
94240	94246	94209	94209	Ayala	287	" YOU ARE NOT HE . "
94443	94466	94434	94435	Colonel Stubbs	385	" That little girl is so thoroughly happy here . Can not you prolong it for her just for another three days ? "
94467	94486	94488	94489	Lady Albury	413	" Is it to be for her,--or for Colonel Stubbs , who is enamoured of the little girl ? "
94491	94495	94497	94498	the Colonel	2361	" For both , "
94503	94509	94497	94498	the Colonel	2361	" Are you in earnest ? "
94510	94555	94488	94489	Lady Albury	413	" What do you call earnest ? I do love to see a pretty creature enjoy herself thoroughly as she does . If you will make her stay till Thursday Albury will let her ride the little horse again at Star Cross on Wednesday . "
94556	94581	94588	94589	Lady Albury	413	" Of course she shall stay,--all the season if you wish it . She is indeed a happy girl if you are in earnest . "
94616	94645	94591	94591	her	413	" Sir Harry says that you have given the little horse quite a name , and that you must finish off his character for him at Star Cross . "
94701	94706	94707	94707	she	413	" But Aunt Margaret ! "
94764	94780	94782	94783	Lady Albury	413	" I will write a note to Mrs. Dosett , and make it all straight , "
95408	95416	95418	95419	Lady Albury	413	" Are they all home from shooting ? "
95449	95459	95460	95460	he	2361	" I am the most ignominious creature in existence , "
95465	95476	95460	95460	he	2361	" one day I tumble into a ditch three feet wide-- "
95477	95485	95487	95487	Nina	426	" It was ten yards at least , "
95498	95529	95487	95487	Nina	426	" And to - day I can not hit a bird . I shall take to writing a book and leave the severer pursuit of sport to more enterprising persons . "
95539	95558	95534	95534	he	2361	" Are you good - natured enough to come and take a walk with me in the shrubbery ? "
95577	95591	95593	95594	Lady Albury	413	" Go with him , my dear , if you are not tired , "
95596	95608	95593	95594	Lady Albury	413	" He deserves consolation after all his good deeds to you . "
95697	95706	95707	95707	he	2044	" Are you afraid to come with me ? "
95721	95755	95707	95707	he	2044	" Afraid ! Oh , dear no , I should not be afraid to go anywhere with you , I think ; only it seemed odd that you did not ask Nina too . "
95756	95763	95707	95707	he	2044	" Shall I tell you why ? "
95764	95769	95707	95707	he	2044	" Why was it ? "
95770	95810	95707	95707	he	2044	" Because I have something to say to you which I do not want Nina to hear just at this moment . And then I thought that we were such friends that you would not mind coming with me . "
95811	95817	95819	95819	Ayala	287	" Of course we are , "
95821	95844	95819	95819	Ayala	287	" I do n't know why it should be so , but I seem to have known you years instead of days . "
95845	95854	95707	95707	he	2044	" Perhaps that is because you knew papa . "
95855	95869	95707	95707	he	2044	" More likely because I have learnt to know your papa 's daughter . "
95870	95876	95707	95707	he	2044	" Do you mean Lucy ? "
95877	95882	95707	95707	he	2044	" I mean Ayala . "
95883	95901	95707	95707	he	2044	" That is saying the same thing twice over . You know me because you know me . "
95902	95925	95707	95707	he	2044	" Just that . How long do you suppose I have known that Mrs. Gregory , who sat opposite to us yesterday ? "
95926	95932	95707	95707	he	2044	" How can I tell ? "
95933	95987	95707	95707	he	2044	" Just fifteen years . I was going to Harrow when she came as a young girl to stay with my mother . Her people and my people had known each other for the last fifty years . Since that I have seen her constantly , and of course we are very intimate . "
95988	95993	95707	95707	he	2044	" I suppose so . "
95994	96089	95707	95707	he	2044	" I know as much about her after all that as if we had lived in two different hemispheres and could n't speak a word of each other 's language . There is n't a thought or a feeling in common between us . I ask after her husband and her children , and then tell her it 's going to rain . She says something about the old General 's health , and then there is an end of everything between us . When next we meet we do it all over again . "
96090	96095	96097	96097	Ayala	287	" How very uninteresting ! "
96099	96135	96097	96097	Ayala	287	" Very uninteresting . It is because there are so many Mrs. Gregorys about that I like to go down to Drumcaller and live by myself . Perhaps you 're a Mrs. Gregory to somebody . "
96136	96157	95707	95707	he	2044	" Why should I be a Mrs. Gregory ? I do n't think I am at all like Mrs. Gregory . "
96158	96165	96097	96097	Ayala	287	" Not to me , Ayala . "
96170	96173	95707	95707	he	2044	" Ayala , "
96255	96309	96240	96240	her	287	" It is because you are to me a creature so essentially different from Mrs. Gregory that I seem to know you so well . I never want to go to Drumcaller if you are near me;--or , if I think of Drumcaller , it is that I might be there with you . "
96310	96331	96205	96205	he	3346	" I am sure the place is very pretty , but I do n't suppose I shall ever see it . "
96332	96343	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" Do you know about your sister and Mr. Hamel ? "
96344	96347	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" Yes , "
96353	96367	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" She has told me all about it . How do you know ? "
96368	96414	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" He was staying at Drumcaller,--he and I together with no one else,--when he went over to ask her . I never saw a man so happy as when he came back from Glenbogie . He had got all that he wanted in the world . "
96415	96426	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" I do so love him because he loves her . "
96427	96436	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" And I love her,--because she loves you . "
96437	96447	96449	96449	Ayala	287	" It is not the same , you know , "
96458	96465	96449	96449	Ayala	287	" May I not love her ? "
96466	96488	96349	96349	Ayala	287	" He is to be my brother . That 's why I love him . She ca n't be your sister . "
96509	96514	96515	96515	he	3348	" Can she not ? "
96518	96530	96515	96515	he	3348	" Of course not . Lucy is to marry Mr. Hamel . "
96531	96539	96449	96449	Ayala	287	" And whom am I to marry ? "
96546	96554	96541	96541	she	7748	" Ayala,--Ayala,--who is to be my wife ? "
96555	96561	96562	96562	she	7748	" I do not know , "
96597	96611	96562	96562	she	7748	" Do you not know whom I would fain have as my wife ? "
96673	96945	96946	96946	She	3350	" Ayala , I have asked you to come out with me that I might ask you to be my wife . It is that that I did not wish Nina to hear at once . If you will put out your hand and say that it shall be so , Nina and all the world shall know it . I shall be as proud then as Hamel , and as happy,--happier , I think . It seems to me that no one can love as I do now , Ayala ; it has grown upon me from hour to hour as I have seen you . When I first took you away to that dance it was so already . Do you remember that night at the theatre,--when I had come away from everything and striven so hard that I might be near to you before you went back to your home ? Ayala , I loved you then so dearly;--but not as I love you now . When I saw you riding away from me yesterday , when I could not get over the brook , I told myself that unless I might catch you at last , and have you all to myself , I could never again be happy . Do you remember when you stooped down and kissed that man 's baby at the farm - house ? Oh , Ayala , I thought then that if you would not be my wife,--if you would not be my wife,--I should never have wife , never should have baby , never should have home of my own . "
97132	97150	97151	97151	he	3351	" You know what I mean , Ayala , when I tell you that I love you , "
97161	97228	97156	97156	she	3350	" I have seen at last the one human being with whom I feel that I can be happy to spend my life , and , having seen her , I ask her to be my wife . The hope has been dwelling with me and growing since I first met you . Shall it be a vain hope ? Ayala , may I still hope ? "
97229	97232	97233	97233	she	3350	" No , "
97238	97243	97233	97233	she	3350	" Is that all ? "
97244	97253	97156	97156	she	3350	" It is all that I can say . "
97254	97270	97156	97156	she	3350	" Is that one ' no ' to be the end of everything between us ? "
97271	97288	97156	97156	she	3350	" I do n't know what else I ought to say to you , Colonel Stubbs . "
97289	97300	97156	97156	she	3350	" Do you mean that you can never love me ? "
97301	97304	97305	97305	she	3350	" Never , "
97308	97360	97305	97305	she	3350	" That is a hard word,--and hardly friendly . Is there to be no more than one hard word between you and me ? Though I did not venture to think that you could tell me that you loved me , I looked for something kinder , something gentler than that . "
97361	97379	97380	97380	Ayala	287	" From such a sharp and waspish word as ' no , ' To pluck the sting ! "
97451	97564	97438	97438	she	287	" You are not he,--not he , not that Angel of Light , which must come to me , radiant with poetry , beautiful to the eye , full of all excellences of art , lifted above the earth by the qualities of his mind,--such a one as must come to me if it be that I am ever to confess that I love . You are not he , and I can not love you . But you shall be the next to him in my estimation , and you are already so dear to me that I would be tender to you , would be gentle,--if only I knew how . "
97583	97597	97598	97598	she	3361	" I do n't know what it is that I ought to say , "
97604	97612	97613	97613	he	3362	" The truth , at any rate , "
97618	97698	97613	97613	he	3362	" but not the truth , half and half , after the fashion of some young ladies . Do not think that you should palter with the truth either because it may not be palatable to me , or seem decorous to yourself . To my happiness this matter is all important , and you are something to my happiness , if only because I have risked it on your love . Tell me;--why can not you love me ? "
97722	97726	97728	97728	she	3361	" It is because-- "
97731	97777	97728	97728	she	3361	" Because why ? Out with it , whatever it is . If it be something that a man may remedy I will remedy it . Do not fear to hurt me . Is it because I am ugly ? That I can not remedy . "
97806	97818	97791	97791	she	3361	" Then God help me , for ugly I must remain . "
97819	97826	97846	97846	her	3361	" It is not that only . "
97827	97839	97841	97841	she	3361	" Is it because my name is Stubbs -- Jonathan Stubbs ? "
97872	97954	97861	97861	she	3361	" If it be so , Ayala , I must tell you that you are wrong,--wrong and foolish ; that you are carried away by a feeling of romance , which is a false romance . Far be it from me to say that I could make you happy , but I am sure that your happiness can not be made and can not be marred by such accidents as that . Do you think that my means are not sufficient ? "
97955	97958	97959	97959	she	3361	" No;--no , "
97962	97984	97959	97959	she	3361	" I know nothing of your means . If I could love you I would not condescend to ask,--even to hear . "
97985	97995	98046	98046	she	3361	" There is no other man , I think ? "
97996	98003	98046	98046	she	3361	" There is no other man . "
98004	98016	98017	98017	she	3361	" But your imagination has depicted to you something grander than I am,"--then
98028	98044	98046	98046	she	3361	him,--"some one who shall better respond to that spirit of poetry which is within you ? "
98065	98137	98046	98046	she	3361	" Then , Ayala , I must strive to soar till I can approach your dreams . But , if you dare to desire things which are really grand , do not allow yourself to be mean at the same time . Do not let the sound of a name move you , or I shall not believe in your aspirations . Now shall I take you back to the house ? "
98333	98342	98343	98344	The Colonel	2361	" THE FINEST HERO THAT I EVER KNEW . "
99170	99175	99177	99177	Nina	426	" Has anything happened ? "
99197	99215	99217	99217	Nina	426	" If you do not tell me everything , I shall think you are no true friend , "
99269	99276	99277	99277	he	385	" Are you dressed for dinner ? "
99280	99312	99277	99277	he	385	" I have n't begun to think of it yet , and Sir Harry hates a man when he comes in late . That wretch Batsby has beaten me four games . "
99460	99470	99471	99471	he	439	" I am told you jumped the Cranbury Brook , "
99474	99485	99471	99471	he	439	" I should as soon think of jumping the Serpentine . "
99486	99495	99501	99502	Lord Rufford	439	" I did it because somebody told me . "
99496	99499	99501	99502	Lord Rufford	439	" Ah , "
99508	99532	99501	99502	Lord Rufford	439	" there is nothing like ignorance , innocence , and youth combined . But why did n't Colonel Stubbs get over after you ? "
99533	99540	99546	99546	he	1206	" Because Colonel Stubbs could n't , "
99555	99561	99563	99564	Sir Harry	415	" It may be possible , "
99566	99600	99563	99564	Sir Harry	415	" that a gentleman should not be able to jump over Cranbury Brook ; but any gentleman , if he will take a little trouble , may come down in time for dinner . "
99601	99613	99615	99616	the Colonel	2361	" Now that I have been duly snubbed right and left , "
99618	99626	99615	99616	the Colonel	2361	" perhaps I may eat my soup . "
99909	99916	99917	99917	he	2361	" I call it d---- indecent , "
100009	100012	100013	100013	she	413	" Ayala , "
100025	100038	100013	100013	she	413	" I am afraid I am going to be angry with you . "
100039	100049	100083	100083	she	413	" Please do n't be angry , Lady Albury . "
100050	100081	100083	100083	she	413	" If I am right in what I surmise , you had an offer made to you yesterday which ought to satisfy the heart of almost any girl in England . "
100097	100117	100083	100083	she	413	" If it was so , the best man I know asked you to share his fortune with him . "
100118	100124	100083	100083	she	413	" Has he told you ? "
100125	100130	100083	100083	she	413	" But he did ? "
100131	100137	100139	100139	Ayala	287	" I shall not tell , "
100143	100211	100139	100139	Ayala	287	" I know he did . I knew that it was his intention before . Are you aware what kind of man is my cousin , Jonathan Stubbs ? Has it occurred to you that in truth and gallantry , in honour , honesty , courage , and real tenderness , he is so perfect as to be quite unlike to the crowd of men you see ? "
100212	100221	100223	100223	Ayala	287	" I do know that he is good , "
100225	100272	100223	100223	Ayala	287	" Good ! Where will you find any one good like him ? Compare him to the other men around him , and then say whether he is good ! Can it be possible that you should refuse the love of such a man as that ? "
100273	100288	100290	100290	Ayala	287	" I do n't think I ought to be made to talk about it , "
100294	100326	100290	100290	Ayala	287	" My dear , it is for your own sake and for his . When you go away from here it may be so difficult for him to see you again . "
100327	100337	100339	100339	Ayala	287	" I do n't suppose he will ever want , "
100341	100359	100339	100339	Ayala	287	" It is sufficient that he wants it now . What better can you expect for yourself ? "
100360	100365	100367	100367	Ayala	287	" I expect nothing , "
100371	100382	100367	100367	Ayala	287	" I have got nothing , and I expect nothing . "
100383	100443	100444	100444	She	287	" He will give you everything , simply because he loves you . My dear , I should not take the trouble to tell you all this , did I not know that he is a man who ought to be accepted when he asks such a request as that . Your happiness would be safe in his hands . "
100456	100513	100444	100444	She	287	" And he is not a man likely to renew such a request . He is too proud for that . I can conceive no possible reason for such a refusal unless it be that you are engaged . If there be some one else , then of course there must be an end of it . "
100514	100521	100367	100367	Ayala	287	" There is no one else . "
100522	100549	100444	100444	She	287	" Then , my dear , with your prospects it is sheer folly . When the General dies he will have over two thousand a year . "
100550	100561	100563	100563	Ayala	287	" As if that had anything to do with it ! "
100580	100588	100590	100591	Lady Albury	413	" It is what I call romance , "
100593	100601	100590	100591	Lady Albury	413	" Romance can never make you happy . "
100602	100645	100676	100677	Lady Albury	413	" At any rate it is not riches . What you call romance may be what I like best . At any rate if I do not love Colonel Stubbs I am sure I ought not to marry him;--and I wo n't . "
100693	100699	100700	100700	she	413	" Well , my dear , "
100703	100803	100700	100700	she	413	" pray,--pray , think better of it . I am in earnest , of course , because of my cousin,--because he seems to have put his heart upon it . He is just the man to be absolutely in love when he is in love . But I would not speak as I do unless I were sure that he would make you happy . My cousin Jonathan is to me the finest hero that I know . When a man is a hero he should n't be broken - hearted for want of a woman 's smiles,--should he ? "
100804	100815	100820	100820	she	287	" She ought not to smile unless she loves him , "
101005	101017	101018	101018	he	385	" Most of us ride to the meet to - morrow , "
101021	101045	101018	101018	he	385	" but you and Nina shall be taken in the waggonette so as to save you a little . It is all arranged . "
101098	101104	101106	101106	Ayala	287	" Then neither shall I , "
101120	101159	101106	101106	Ayala	287	" But you must . It is all settled , and Sir Harry would be offended if you did not go . What has Jonathan done that you should refuse to ride with him because I am lame ? "
101160	101163	101165	101165	Ayala	287	" Nothing , "
101167	101208	101165	101165	Ayala	287	" Oh , Ayala , do tell me . I should tell you everything . Of course you must hunt whatever it is . Even though he should have offered and you refused him , of course you must go . "
101209	101213	101215	101215	Ayala	287	" Must I ? "
101217	101224	101215	101215	Ayala	287	" Then you have refused him ? "
101225	101263	101165	101165	Ayala	287	" I have . Oh , Nina , pray do not speak of it . Do not think of it if you can help it . Why should everything be disturbed because I have been a fool ? "
101264	101274	101165	101165	Ayala	287	" Then you think you have been a fool ? "
101275	101334	101165	101165	Ayala	287	" Other people think so ; but if so I shall at any rate be constant to my folly . What I mean is , that it has been done , and should be passed over as done with . I am quite sure that I ought not to be scolded ; but Lady Albury did scold me . "
101579	101582	101583	101583	he	385	" Ayala , "
101586	101615	101583	101583	he	385	" of course you know that it is my duty to look after you , and to do it better if I can than I did on Friday . "
101616	101620	101621	101621	she	287	" I understand , "
101624	101653	101583	101583	he	385	" Do not let any remembrance of that walk on Saturday interfere with your happiness to - day . Who knows when you may be out hunting again ? "
101654	101657	101658	101658	she	287	" Never ! "
101661	101672	101658	101658	she	287	" I do n't suppose I shall ever hunt again . "
101673	101677	101678	101678	he	385	" Carpe diem , "
101683	101694	101678	101678	he	385	" Do you know what ' carpe diem ' means ? "
101695	101701	101658	101658	she	287	" It is Latin perhaps . "
101702	101790	101658	101658	she	287	" Yes ; and therefore you are not supposed to understand it . This is what it means . As an hour for joy has come , do not let any trouble interfere with it . Let it all be , for this day at least , as though there had been no walk in the Stalham Woods . There is Larry Twentyman . If I break down as I did on Friday you may always trust to him . Larry and you are old friends now . "
101791	101795	101799	101799	herself	287	" Carpe diem , "
101801	101828	101796	101796	she	287	" Oh , yes ; if it were only possible . How is one to ' carpe diem ' with one 's heart full of troubles ? "
101948	101964	101941	101941	his	434	" Oh , Miss Dormer , I am so delighted to see you out again . "
101965	101974	102038	102038	his	434	" How is the baby , Mr. Twentyman ? "
101975	101987	102038	102038	his	434	" Brisk as a bee , and hungry as a hunter . "
101988	101995	101941	101941	his	434	" And how is Mrs. Twentyman ? "
101996	102014	102038	102038	his	434	" Brisker and hungrier than the baby . What do you think of the day , Colonel ? "
102015	102035	102036	102036	Larry	434	" A very good sort of day , Twentyman , if we were anywhere out of these big woods . "
102072	102083	102085	102086	the Colonel	2361	" We 've got to draw them , of course , "
102320	102330	102332	102333	Aunt Margaret	285	" I have had a letter from Lady Albury , "
102348	102377	102332	102333	Aunt Margaret	285	" Yes , I know , Aunt Margaret . She wrote to ask that I might stay for four more days . I hope it was not wrong . "
102378	102425	102440	102441	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I have had another letter since that , on Monday , about it ; I have determined to show it you . There it is . You had better read it by yourself , and I will come to you again in half an hour . "
103588	103598	103604	103604	she	285	" Have you read the letter , my dear ? "
103636	103647	103616	103616	She	285	" Yes , Aunt Margaret , I have read it . "
103648	103655	103604	103604	she	285	" I suppose it is true ? "
103656	103665	103604	103604	she	285	" True ! It is true in part . "
103666	103674	103604	103604	she	285	" You did meet this Colonel Stubbs ? "
103675	103684	103604	103604	she	285	" Oh , yes ; I met him . "
103685	103693	103604	103604	she	285	" And you had met him before ? "
103694	103715	103604	103604	she	285	" Yes , Aunt Margaret . He used to come to Brook Street . He is the Marchesa 's nephew . "
103716	103719	103604	103604	she	285	" Did he-- "
103737	103748	103722	103723	Aunt Margaret	285	" Did he make love to you in Brook Street ? "
103749	103752	103754	103754	Ayala	287	" No , "
103758	103763	103754	103754	Ayala	287	" Not at all ? "
103764	103799	103604	103604	she	285	" Not at all . I never thought of such a thing . I never dreamed of such a thing when he began talking to me out in the woods at Stalham on Saturday . "
103800	103812	103604	103604	she	285	" Had you been -- been on friendly terms with him ? "
103813	103865	103754	103754	Ayala	287	" Very friendly terms . We were quite friends , and used to talk about all manner of things . I was very fond of him , and never afraid of anything that he said to me . He was Nina 's cousin and seemed almost to be my cousin too . "
103866	103873	103604	103604	she	285	" Then you do like him ? "
103874	103898	103604	103604	she	285	" Of course I do . Everybody must like him . But that is no reason why I should want to marry him . "
104192	104195	104196	104196	she	3505	" Ayala , "
104199	104208	104196	104196	she	3505	" you ought to think better of it . "
104209	104218	104150	104150	she	3505	" Think better of what , Aunt Margaret ? "
104219	104235	104196	104196	she	3505	" You have seen what this Lady Albury says about her cousin , Colonel Stubbs . "
104236	104245	104196	104196	she	3505	" What has that to do with it ? "
104246	104262	104150	104150	she	3505	" You believe what she says ? If so why should you not accept him ? "
104263	104269	104271	104271	Ayala	287	" Because I ca n't , "
104273	104287	104289	104290	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Have you any idea what is to become of your future life ? "
104295	104301	104303	104303	Ayala	287	" Not in the least , "
104340	104353	104312	104312	she	287	" Gentlemen wo n't come running after you always , my dear . "
104374	104398	104367	104367	she	287	" It 's a great shame to say that . I do n't want anybody to run after me . I never did . "
104399	104416	104367	104367	she	287	" No , my dear ; no . I do n't think that you ever did . "
104478	104502	104428	104428	herself	285	" I only want to explain to you that people must,--must,--must make their hay while the sun shines . You are young now . "
104503	104514	104516	104516	Ayala	287	" I am not one - and - twenty yet , "
104520	104548	104516	104516	Ayala	287	" One - and - twenty is a very good time for a girl to marry,--that is to say if a proper sort of gentleman asks her . "
104549	104632	104640	104641	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't think I ought to be scolded because they do n't seem to me to be the proper sort . I do n't want anybody to come . Nobody ought to be talked to about it at all . If I cared about any one that you or Uncle Reginald did not approve , then you might talk to me . But I do n't think that anything ought to be said about anybody unless I like him myself . "
104705	104712	104714	104715	Mr. Dosett	270	" It simply means selling herself , "
104717	104751	104714	104715	Mr. Dosett	270	" That is nonsense , Reginald . Of course such a girl as Ayala has to do the best she can with her good looks . What else has she to depend upon ? "
104752	104765	104684	104684	he	270	" My brother - in - law will do something for her . "
104766	104887	104714	104715	Mr. Dosett	270	" I hope he will,--though I do not think that a very safe reed to depend upon as she has twice offended him . But of course a girl thinks of marrying . Ayala would be very much disgusted if she were told that she was to be an old maid , and live upon £ 100 a year supplied by Sir Thomas 's bounty . It might have been that she would have to do it;--but now that chances are open she ought to take them . She should choose between her cousin Tom and this Colonel Stubbs ; and you should tell her that , if she will not , you will no longer be responsible for her . "
105304	105311	105312	105312	she	266	" You have n't seen him ? "
105318	105322	105324	105324	Ayala	287	" Seen who ? "
105329	105331	105324	105324	Ayala	287	" hims "
105344	105346	105341	105341	her	287	" hims "
105353	105364	105365	105365	Ayala	287	" Isadore . He said that he would call here . "
105395	105398	105400	105400	Lucy	266	" Ayala , "
105402	105409	105400	105400	Lucy	266	" what am I to do ? "
105410	105415	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Stick to him , "
105421	105439	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Of course I shall . But Aunt Emmeline thinks that I ought to give him up or-- "
105440	105444	105400	105400	Lucy	266	" Or what ? "
105445	105450	105452	105452	Lucy	266	" Or go away , "
105457	105464	105452	105452	Lucy	266	" Where would you go to ? "
105465	105571	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Oh , where indeed ? Of course he would have me , but it would be ruin to him to marry a wife without a penny when he earns only enough for his own wants . His father has quarrelled with him altogether . He says that nobody can prevent our being married if we please , and that he is quite ready to make a home for me instantly ; but I know that last year he hardly earned more than two hundred pounds after paying all his expenses , and were I to take him at his word I should ruin him . "
105572	105580	105400	105400	Lucy	266	" Would Uncle Tom turn you out ? "
105581	105634	105452	105452	Lucy	266	" He has been away almost ever since Mr. Hamel came to Glenbogie , and I do not know what he will say . Aunt Emmeline declares that I can only stay with them just as though I were her daughter , and that a daughter would be bound to obey her . "
105635	105644	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Does Gertrude obey her about Mr. Houston ? "
105645	105680	105400	105400	Lucy	266	" Gertrude has her own way with her mother altogether . And of course a daughter can not really be turned out . If she tells me to go I suppose I must go . "
105681	105688	105690	105690	Ayala	287	" I should ask Uncle Tom , "
105692	105739	105690	105690	Ayala	287	" She could not make you go out into the street . When she had to get rid of me , she could send me here in exchange ; but she ca n't say now that you do n't suit , and have me back again . "
105740	105763	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Oh , Ayala , it is so miserable . I feel that I do not know what to do with myself . "
105764	105769	105771	105771	Ayala	287	" Nor do I , "
105784	105807	105771	105771	Ayala	287	" It does seem to be so cross - grained . Nobody will let you marry , and everybody will make me . "
105808	105817	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Do they still trouble you about Tom ? "
105818	105833	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" It is not Tom now , Lucy . Another man has come up . "
105834	105839	105771	105771	Ayala	287	" As a lover ? "
105840	105861	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Oh , yes ; quite so . His name is,--such a name , Lucy,--his name is Colonel Jonathan Stubbs . "
105862	105874	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" That is Isadore 's friend,--the man who lives at Drumcaller . "
105875	105900	105771	105771	Ayala	287	" Exactly . He told me that Mr. Hamel was at Drumcaller with him . And now he wants me to be his wife . "
105901	105908	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Do you not like him ? "
105909	105966	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" That is the worst part of it all , Lucy . If I did not like him I should not mind it half so much . It is just because I like him so very much that I am so very unhappy . His hair is just the colour of Aunt Emmeline 's big shawl . "
105967	105973	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" What does that signify ? "
105974	105985	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" And his mouth stretches almost from ear to ear . "
105986	105997	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" I should n't care a bit for his mouth . "
105998	106033	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" I do n't think I do much , because he does look so good - natured when he laughs . Indeed he is always the most good - natured man that ever lived . "
106034	106044	106046	106046	Lucy	266	" Has he got an income enough for marriage ? "
106061	106077	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Plenty they tell me,--though I do not in the least know what plenty means . "
106078	106088	105417	105417	Ayala	287	" Then Ayala why should you not have him ? "
106089	106095	106097	106097	Ayala	287	" Because I ca n't , "
106099	106137	106097	106097	Ayala	287	" How is a girl to love a man if she does not love him . Liking has nothing to do with it . You do n't think liking ought to have anything to do with it ? "
106196	106235	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" I tell you fairly that I think you altogether wrong;--that it is cowardly , unmanly , and disgraceful . I do n't mean , you see , to put what you call a fine point upon it . "
106236	106243	106530	106531	the lady	2267	" No , you do n't . "
106244	106287	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" It is one of those matters on which a person must speak the truth or not speak at all . I should not have spoken unless you forced it upon me . You do n't care for her in the least . "
106288	106321	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" That 's true . I do not know that I am especially quick at what you call caring for young ladies . If I care for anybody it is for you . "
106322	106354	106530	106531	the lady	2267	" I suppose so ; but that may as well be dropped for the present . You mean to marry this girl simply because she has got a lot of money ? "
106355	106372	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" Exactly that;--as you before long will marry some gentleman only because he has got money . "
106373	106438	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" You have no right to say so because I am engaged to no man . But if I were so it is quite different . Unless I marry I can be nobody . I can have no existence that I can call my own . I have no other way of pushing myself into the world 's notice . You are a man . "
106439	106466	106530	106531	the lady	2267	" You mean to say that I could become a merchant or a lawyer,--be a Lord Chancellor in time , or perhaps an Archbishop of Canterbury . "
106467	106505	106193	106194	MISS DOCIMER	372	" You can live and eat and drink and go where you wish without being dependent on any one . If I had your freedom and your means do you think that I would marry for money ? "
106653	106676	106678	106678	Frank	344	" I do not know that any two persons were ever further asunder in an argument than you and I in this , "
106696	106724	106678	106678	Frank	344	" I conceive that you are led away by a desire to deceive yourself , whereas hypocrisy should only be used with the object of deceiving others . "
106725	106732	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" How do I deceive myself ? "
106733	106963	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" In making believe that men are generally different from what they are;--in trying to suppose that I ought to be , if I am not , a hero . You shall not find a man whose main object is not that of securing an income . The clergyman who preaches against gold licks the ground beneath the minister 's feet in order that he may become a bishop . The barrister cares not with what case he may foul his hands so long as he may become rich . The man in trade is so aware of his own daily dishonesty that he makes two separate existences for himself , and endeavours to atone for his rascality in the City by his performance of all duties at the West End . I regard myself to be so infinitely cleaner in my conscience than other men that I could not bring myself to be a bishop , an attorney - general , or a great merchant . Of all the ways open to me this seems to me to be the least sordid . I give her the only two things which she desires,--myself and a position . She will give me the only thing I desire , which is some money . When you marry you 'll make an equally fine bargain,--only your wares will be your beauty . "
106964	106974	106678	106678	Frank	344	" You will not give her yourself;--not your heart . "
106975	107155	107156	107156	They	3558	" Yes , I shall . I shall make the most of her , and shall do so by becoming as fond of her as I can . Of course I like breeding . Of course I like beauty . Of course I like that aroma of feminine charm which can only be produced by a mixture of intellect , loveliness , taste , and early association . I do n't pretend to say that my future would not be much sweeter before me with you as my wife,--if only either of us had a sufficiency of income . I acknowledge that . But then I acknowledge also that I prefer Miss Tringle , with £ 100,000 , to you with nothing ; and I do not think that I ought to be called unmanly , disgraceful , and a coward , because I have courage enough to speak the truth openly to a friend whom I trust . My theory of life shocks you , not because it is uncommon , but because it is not commonly declared . "
107182	107205	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" I must ask you not to speak to me again as one who by any possibility could have been your wife . "
107206	107225	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" Very well . You will not wish me to abandon the privilege of thinking of past possibilities ? "
107226	107233	106678	106678	Frank	344	" I would,--if it were possible . "
107234	107254	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" Quite impossible ! One 's thoughts , I imagine , are always supposed to be one 's own . "
107255	107316	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" You know what I mean . A gentleman will always spare a woman if he can do so ; and there are cases , such as have been ours , in which it is a most imperative duty to do so . You should not have followed us when you had made up your mind about this young lady . "
107317	107333	106678	106678	Frank	344	" I took care to let you know , beforehand , that I intended it . "
107334	107354	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" You should not have thrown the weight upon me . You should not even have written to me . "
107355	107393	107394	107394	He	3561	" I wonder what you would have said then,--how loudly you would have abused me,--had I not written ! Would you not have told me then that I had not the courage to be open with you ? "
107405	107517	107401	107401	she	3562	" But I do recognise the necessity of my becoming subject to abuse in this state of affairs . I have been in no respect false , nor in any way wanting in affection . When I suggested to you that £ 600 a - year between us , with an increasing family , and lodgings in Marylebone , would be uncomfortable , you shuddered at the prospect . When I explained to you that you would have the worst of it because my club would be open to me , you were almost angry with me because I seemed to imply that there could be any other than one decision . "
107518	107534	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" There could only be one decision,--unless you were man enough to earn your bread . "
107535	107574	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" But I was n't . But I ai n't . You might as well let that accident pass , sans dire . Was there ever a moment in which you thought that I should earn my bread ? "
107575	107593	107401	107401	she	3562	" Never for a moment did I endow you with the power of doing anything so manly . "
107594	107646	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" Then why throw it in my teeth now ? That is not fair . However , I do own that I have to be abused . I do n't see any way in which you and I are to part without it . But you need not descend to Billingsgate . "
107647	107658	107172	107173	Miss Docimer	372	" I have not descended to Billingsgate , Mr. Houston . "
107659	107710	107401	107401	she	3562	" Upper - world Billingsgate ! Cowardice , as an accusation from a woman to a man , is upper - world Billingsgate . But it does n't matter . Of course I know what it means . Do you think your brother wants me to go away at once ? "
107711	107715	107716	107716	she	3563	" At once , "
107719	107737	107716	107716	she	3563	" That would be disagreeable and absurd . You mean to sit to me for that head ? "
107738	107742	107401	107401	she	3562	" Certainly not . "
107743	107789	107401	107401	she	3562	" I can not in the least understand why not . What has a question of art to do with marriage or giving in marriage ? And why should Mrs. Docimer be so angry with me , when she has known the truth all along ? "
107790	107834	107401	107401	she	3562	" There are questions which it is of no avail to answer . I have come out with you now because I thought it well that we should have a final opportunity of understanding each other . You understand me at any rate . "
107835	107838	107839	107839	he	3563	" Perfectly , "
107842	107856	107839	107839	he	3563	" You have taken especial care on this occasion to make yourself intelligible . "
107857	107890	107401	107401	she	3562	" So I intended . And as you do understand me , and know how far I am from approving your philosophy , you can hardly wish to remain with us longer . "
108028	108031	108032	108032	he	344	" Imogene , "
108035	108062	108032	108032	he	344	" if it is intended that I am to start by the diligence for Innspruck this evening , you had better bid me farewell at once . "
108063	108070	108071	108071	she	2640	" I have bidden you farewell , "
108074	108109	108032	108032	he	344	" Then you have done it in so bitter a mood that you had better try your hand at it again . Heaven only knows in what manner you or I may meet again . "
108110	108116	108117	108117	she	2640	" What does it matter ? "
108120	108186	108032	108032	he	344	" I have always felt that the hearts of men are softer than the hearts of women . A woman 's hand is soft , but she can steel her heart when she thinks it necessary , as no man can do . Does it occur to you at this moment that there has been some true affection between you and me in former days ? "
108187	108194	108032	108032	he	344	" I wish it did not . "
108195	108314	108032	108032	he	344	" It may be so that I wish it also ; but there is the fact . No wishing will enable me to get rid of it . No wishing will save me from the memory of early dreams and sweet longings and vain triumphs . There is the remembrance of bright glory made very sad to me by the meanness of the existing truth . I do not say but that I would obliterate it if I could ; but it is not to be obliterated ; the past will not be made more pleasant to me by any pretence of present indignation . I should have thought that it would have been the same with you . "
108315	108322	108032	108032	he	344	" There has been no glory , "
108326	108334	108323	108323	she	3576	" though I quite acknowledge the meanness . "
108335	108345	108032	108032	he	344	" There has been at any rate some love . "
108346	108533	108534	108534	He	3577	" Misplaced . You had better let me pass on . I have , as you say , steeled myself . I will not condescend to any tenderness . In my brother 's presence and my sister 's I will wish you good - bye and express a hope that you may be successful in your enterprises . Here , by the brook - side , out upon the mountain - path , where there is no one to hear us but our two selves , I will bid you no farewell softer than that already spoken . Go and do as you propose . You have my leave . When it shall have been done there shall never be a word spoken by me against it . But , when you ask me whether you are right , I will only say that I think you to be wrong . It may be that you owe nothing to me ; but you owe something to her , and something also to yourself . Now , Mr. Houston , I shall be glad to pass on . "
108591	108600	108601	108601	she	372	" I will not condescend to any tenderness , "
108635	108639	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Mr. Houston , "
108652	108670	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" I thought it was understood that you and Imogene should not go out alone together again . "
108671	108685	108686	108686	he	3577	" I have taken my place to Innspruck by the diligence this evening , "
108689	108710	108686	108686	he	3577	" Perhaps it will be better so , though both Mudbury and I will be sorry to lose your company . "
108711	108786	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Yes , Mrs. Docimer , I have taken my place . Your sister seemed to think that there would be great danger if I waited till to - morrow morning when I could have got a pleasant lift in a return carriage . I hate travelling at night and I hate diligences . I was quite prepared to post all the way , though it would have ruined me,--only for this accursed diligence . "
108787	108796	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" I am sorry you should be inconvenienced . "
108797	108834	108686	108686	he	3577	" It does not signify . What a man without a wife may suffer in that way never does signify . It 's just fourteen hours . You would n't like Docimer to come with me . "
108835	108857	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" That 's nonsense . You need n't go the whole way unless you like . You could sleep at Brunecken . "
108858	108871	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Brunecken is only twelve miles , and it might be dangerous . "
108872	108883	108686	108686	he	3577	" Of course you choose to turn everything into ridicule . "
108884	108954	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Better that than tears , Mrs. Docimer . What 's the good of crying ? I ca n't make myself an elder son . I ca n't endow Imogene with a hundred thousand pounds . She told me just now that I might earn my bread , but she knows that I ca n't . It 's very sad . But what can be got by being melancholy ? "
108955	108967	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" At any rate you had better be away from her . "
108968	109022	108686	108686	he	3577	" I am going,--this evening . Shall I walk on , half a stage , at once , without any dinner ? I wish you had heard the kind of things she said to me . You would not have thought that I had gone to walk with her for my own pleasure . "
109023	109030	108641	108642	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Have you not deserved them ? "
109031	109064	109065	109066	Mr. Docimer	465	" I think not;--but nevertheless I bore them . A woman , of course , can say what she pleases . There 's Docimer,--I hope he wo n't call me a coward . "
109086	109098	109100	109101	Mrs. Docimer	373	" He is going by the diligence to Innspruck this afternoon , "
109103	109121	109100	109101	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Why did he come ? A man with a grain of feeling would have remained away . "
109122	109127	109129	109129	Frank	344	" Now , Docimer , "
109131	109185	109129	109129	Frank	344	" pray do not make yourself unpleasant . Your sister has been abusing me all the morning like a pickpocket , and your wife looks at me as though she would say just as much if she dared . After all , what is it I have done that you think so wicked ? "
109186	109194	109196	109197	Mrs. Docimer	373	" What will everybody think at home , "
109199	109225	109196	109197	Mrs. Docimer	373	" when they know that you 're with us again ? What chance is she to have if you follow her about in this way ? "
109226	109235	109237	109237	Frank	344	" I shall not follow her very long , "
109239	109255	109237	109237	Frank	344	" My wings will soon be cut , and then I shall never fly again . "
109302	109310	109311	109311	he	344	" Of course it is all bad , "
109314	109342	109311	109311	he	344	" Of course we have all been fools . You knew it , and allowed it ; and have no right to say a word to me . "
109343	109357	109359	109359	Docimer	373	" We thought that when your uncle died there would have been money , "
109366	109387	109359	109359	Docimer	373	" Exactly ; and so did I. You do not mean to say that I deceived either you or her ? "
109388	109403	109311	109311	he	344	" There should have been an end of it when that hope was over . "
109404	109512	109359	109359	Docimer	373	" Of course there should . There should never have been a dream that she or I could marry on six hundred a year . Had not all of us been fools , we should have taken our hats off and bade each other farewell for ever when the state of the old man 's affairs was known . We were fools ; but we were fools together ; and none of us have a right to abuse the others . When I became acquainted with this young lady at Rome , it had been settled among us that Imogene and I must seek our fortunes apart . "
109513	109522	109525	109526	Mr. Docimer	465	" Then why did you come after her ? "
109539	109542	109543	109543	she	372	" Mary , "
109553	109577	109543	109543	she	372	" I hope you are not carrying on this battle with Mr. Houston . I have said what there was to be said . "
109578	109589	109591	109592	her brother	1507	" You should have held your tongue and said nothing , "
109594	109660	109591	109592	her brother	1507	" Be that as it may I have said it , and he quite understands what I think about it . Let us eat our dinner in peace and quietness , and then let him go on his travels . He has the world free before him , which he no doubt will open like an oyster , though he does not carry a sword . "
109745	109751	109753	109753	Docimer	373	" Well , old fellow , "
109755	109772	109753	109753	Docimer	373	" take care of yourself . Perhaps everything will turn up right some of these days . "
109773	109781	109783	109783	Imogene	372	" Good - bye , Mr. Houston , "
109798	109805	109807	109807	he	344	" God bless you , Imogene , "
109852	109856	109858	109858	she	372	" And now , "
109871	109899	109858	109858	she	372	" I will ask a great favour of you both . I will beg you not to let there be another word about Mr. Houston among us . "
110879	110885	110887	110888	Sir Thomas	271	" Where 's your mistress ? "
110966	110970	110972	110973	Mr. Traffick	321	" My dear , "
110985	110997	110972	110973	Mr. Traffick	321	" your father has come down in one of his tantrums . "
110998	111004	111006	111006	Augusta	302	" I knew he would , "
111008	111074	111006	111006	Augusta	302	" But it does not signify the least . Give him a kiss when you see him , and do n't seem to notice it . There is not a man in the world has a higher regard for me than your father , but if any one were to see him in one of his tantrums they would suppose he meant to be uncivil . "
111075	111087	111089	111090	his wife	672	" I hope he wo n't be downright unkind , Septimus , "
111092	111108	111089	111090	his wife	672	" Never fear ! The kindest - hearted man in the world is your father . "
111109	111115	111006	111006	Augusta	302	" So he 's here ! "
111136	111142	111124	111125	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , Tom;--they're here . "
111143	111149	111089	111090	his wife	672	" When did they come ? "
111150	111161	111089	111090	his wife	672	" Well;--to tell the truth , we found them here . "
111162	111166	111124	111125	Sir Thomas	271	" The ---- ! "
111184	111213	111168	111169	Sir Thomas	271	" They thought we were to be here a day sooner , and so they came on the Wednesday morning . They were to come , you know . "
111214	111225	111089	111090	his wife	672	" I wish I knew when they were to go . "
111226	111242	111168	111169	Sir Thomas	271	" You do n't want to turn your own daughter out of your own house ? "
111243	111311	111089	111090	his wife	672	" Why does n't he get a house of his own for her ? For her sake why does n't he do it ? He has the spending of £ 6,000 a year of my money , and yet I am to keep him ! No;--I do n't want to turn my daughter out of my house ; but it 'll end in my turning him out . "
111380	111386	111387	111387	he	271	" Everything is down again , "
111390	111402	111404	111404	Traffick	321	" Fluctuations are always common at this time of the year , "
111406	111420	111404	111404	Traffick	321	" but I observe that trade always becomes brisk a little before Christmas . "
111421	111439	111441	111442	Sir Thomas	271	" To a man with a fixed income , like you , it does n't much matter , "
111444	111455	111441	111442	Sir Thomas	271	" I was looking at it in a public light . "
111456	111484	111485	111486	Mr. Traffick	321	" Exactly . A man who has an income , and never spends it , need not trouble himself with private views as to the money market . "
111864	111877	111878	111879	Lady Tringle	282	" If anything is to be done you must do it yourself , "
111883	111886	111888	111888	Gertrude	404	" Papa , "
111911	111922	111888	111888	Gertrude	404	" I wish something could be settled about Mr. Houston . "
111980	111983	111985	111985	he	271	" Then , "
111987	111999	111985	111985	he	271	" you may as well have it all settled at once . "
112000	112005	112224	112224	Gertrude	404	" How , papa ? "
112006	112025	111985	111985	he	271	" You may understand for good and all that I will have nothing to do with Mr. Houston . "
112026	112035	111985	111985	he	271	" Papa , that would be very cruel . "
112036	112069	112224	112224	Gertrude	404	" My dear , if you call me cruel I will not allow you to come and talk to me at all . Cruel indeed ! What is your idea of cruelty ? "
112070	112081	111985	111985	he	271	" Everybody knows that we are attached to each other . "
112082	112130	111985	111985	he	271	" Everybody knows nothing of the kind . I know nothing of the kind . And you are only making a fool of yourself . Mr. Houston is a penniless adventurer and is only attached to my money . He shall never see a penny of it . "
112131	112165	112224	112224	Gertrude	404	" He is not an adventurer , papa . He is much less like an adventurer than Mr. Traffick . He has an income of his own , only it is not much . "
112166	112223	111985	111985	he	271	" About as much as would pay his bill at the club for cigars and champagne . You may make your mind at rest , for I will not give Mr. Houston a shilling . Why should a man expect to live out of my earnings who never did a day 's work in his life ? "
112646	112662	112636	112636	she	404	" If you wo n't give us £ 120,000 let us begin with £ 60,000 . "
112737	112741	112742	112742	she	404	" Dear Frank , "
113206	113212	113214	113215	Mrs. Traffick	330	" I believe , papa , "
113229	113254	113214	113215	Mrs. Traffick	330	" that Gertrude is thinking of doing something wrong , and therefore I feel it to be my duty to bring you this letter . "
113276	113283	113284	113284	she	302	" I wo n't advise it , "
113288	113312	113284	113284	she	302	" but , if you do , Mr. Houston should arrange to be married at Ostend . I know that can be done . "
113340	113347	113337	113337	she	302	" felt it to be her duty "
113472	113485	113467	113467	he	271	" There ought to be gentlemen who do n't earn their bread ! "
113486	113490	113492	113492	he	271	" Ought there ? "
113522	113538	113509	113509	He	271	" Mamma is quite afraid of him , and does n't dare say a word . "
113544	113555	113509	113509	He	271	" I am sure he would give the money afterwards . "
113556	113567	113568	113568	he	271	" I am sure he would do no such thing , "
113613	113630	113606	113607	his girl	1285	" He is always so good - natured in the long run , and so generous ! "
113632	113636	113637	113637	he	271	" good - natured "
113800	113808	113810	113811	the coachman	3701	" If you please , Sir Thomas , "
113822	113842	113810	113811	the coachman	3701	knocking,--"if you please , Phoebe mare has been brought home with both her knees cut down to the bone . "
113843	113846	113848	113849	Sir Thomas	271	" What ! "
113869	113882	113884	113885	the coachman	3701	" Yes , indeed , Sir Thomas , down to the bone , "
113908	113953	113884	113885	the coachman	3701	" Mr. Traffick brought her down on Windover Hill , Sir Thomas , and she 'll never be worth a feed of oats again . I did n't think a man was born who could throw that mare off her feet , Sir Thomas . "
114234	114238	114239	114239	he	271	" Good heavens ! "
114247	114252	114239	114239	he	271	" What is this ? "
114320	114328	114301	114301	Traffick	321	" Good heavens , what is this ? "
114339	114351	114353	114353	Traffick	321	" There are a lot of loose stones on that hill , "
114355	114391	114353	114353	Traffick	321	" and she tripped on one and came down , all in a lump , before you could look at her . I 'm awfully sorry , but it might have happened to any one . "
114410	114417	114419	114419	he	271	" She has utterly destroyed herself , "
114440	114470	114419	114419	he	271	" I 'm afraid she has , Sir Thomas . The joint - oil will be sure to run on both knees ; the gashes is so mortal deep . "
114471	114484	114486	114487	Sir Thomas	271	" I 've driven that mare hundreds of times down that hill , "
114489	114499	114486	114487	Sir Thomas	271	" and I never knew her to trip before . "
114500	114506	114508	114509	the groom	3727	" Never , Sir Thomas , "
114511	114523	114525	114526	Mr. Traffick	321	" She 'd have come down with you to - day , "
114531	114550	114525	114526	Mr. Traffick	321	" It was my own fault , Bunsum . That 's all that can be said about it . "
114577	114591	114593	114594	Sir Thomas	271	" Of course I ought to have known that he could n't drive , "
114596	114605	114607	114608	Mr. Traffick	321	" A horse may fall down with anybody , "
114610	114620	114622	114623	Sir Thomas	271	" You 'd better take her and shoot her , "
114630	114649	114622	114623	Sir Thomas	271	" She was the best thing we had in the stable , but now she is done for . "
114688	114699	114701	114701	he	321	" I have told you that I am very sorry , "
114708	114721	114701	114701	he	321	" and I do n't know what a man can do more . "
114722	114733	114701	114701	he	321	" Nothing,--unless it be not to borrow a horse again . "
114734	114745	114701	114701	he	321	" You may be sure I will never do that . "
114746	114776	114701	114701	he	321	" I 'm not sure of it at all . If you wanted another to - morrow you 'd ask for him if you thought you could get him . "
114777	114789	114701	114701	he	321	" I call that very uncivil , Sir Thomas,--and very unkind . "
114790	114793	114795	114796	Sir Thomas	271	" Bother ! "
114798	114861	114795	114796	Sir Thomas	271	" It is no good in being kind to a fellow like you . Did you ever hear what the cabman did who had a sovereign given to him for driving a mile . He asked the fool who gave it him to make it a guinea . I am the fool , and , by George , you are the cabman ! "
114891	114899	114900	114900	he	271	" Your father has insulted me horribly , "
114916	114925	114900	114900	he	271	" What is the matter now , Septimus ? "
114926	114956	114900	114900	he	271	" That little mare of his , which I have no doubt has come down half a score of times before , fell with me and cut her knees . "
114957	114962	114964	114964	Augusta	302	" That 's Phoebe , "
114966	114972	114964	114964	Augusta	302	" She was his favourite . "
114973	115017	114900	114900	he	271	" It 's a kind of thing that might happen to anyone , and no gentleman thinks of mentioning it . He said such things to me that upon my word I do n't think I can stop in the house any longer . "
115018	115026	115028	115029	the wife	3741	" Oh , yes , you will , "
115031	115060	115028	115029	the wife	3741	" Of course , it is a difference coming from one 's father - in - law . It 's almost the same as from one 's father . "
115061	115070	114900	114900	he	271	" He did n't mean it , Septimus . "
115071	115119	115028	115029	the wife	3741	" I suppose not . If he had , I really could n't have borne it . He does become very rough sometimes , but I know that at bottom he has a thorough respect for me . It is only that induces me to bear it . "
115300	115303	115305	115305	he	271	" Father , "
115307	115317	115305	115305	he	271	" I am getting confoundedly sick of all this . "
115318	115321	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Confounded , "
115326	115338	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" is a stupid foolish word , and it means nothing . "
115339	115351	115353	115353	Tom	271	" There is a sort of comfort in it , Sir , "
115355	115366	115353	115353	Tom	271	" but if it 's objectionable I 'll drop it . "
115367	115372	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" It is objectionable . "
115373	115390	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" I 'll drop it , Sir . But nevertheless I am very sick of it . "
115391	115400	115353	115353	Tom	271	" What are you sick of , Tom ? "
115401	115409	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" All this affair with my cousin . "
115410	115425	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Then , if you take my advice , you 'll drop that too . "
115426	115471	115353	115353	Tom	271	" I could n't do that , father . A word is all very well . A man can drop a word ; but a girl is a different sort of thing . One ca n't drop a girl , even if one tries . "
115472	115479	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Have you tried , Tom ? "
115480	115572	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , I have . I 've done my best to try . I put it out of my mind for a fortnight and would n't think of her . I had a bottle of champagne every day at dinner and then went to the theatre . But it was all of no use . I have set my heart on it and I ca n't give her up . I 'll tell you what I 'd like to do . I 'd like to give her a diamond necklace . "
115573	115582	115584	115585	Sir Thomas	271	" It would n't be the slightest use , "
115591	115613	115588	115588	his	271	" Why not ? It 's what other men do . I mean it to be something handsome;--about three hundred pounds . "
115614	115626	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" That 's a large sum of money for a necklace . "
115627	115638	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Some of them cost a deal more than that . "
115639	115649	115588	115588	his	271	" And you 'd only throw away your money . "
115650	115679	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" If she took it , she 'd take me too . If she didn't,--why I should still have the diamonds . I mean to try any way . "
115680	115692	115323	115324	Sir Thomas	271	" Then it 's of no use your coming to me . "
115693	115794	115588	115588	his	271	" I thought you 'd let me have the money . It 's no good running into debt for them . And then if you 'd add something of your own,--a locket , or something of that kind,--I think it would have an effect . I have seen a necklace at Ricolay 's , and if I could pay ready money for it I could have 20 per cent . off it . The price named is three hundred guineas . That would make it £ 254 5_s _ . £ 250 would buy it if the cheque was offered . "
115928	115946	115948	115949	Sir Thomas	271	" Should she become my promised daughter - in - law then I would send her presents , "
117021	117032	117033	117034	Sir Thomas	271	" She can do as she pleases , of course , "
117239	117243	117244	117244	he	271	" My dear , "
117249	117257	117244	117244	he	271	" why are you walking about alone ? "
117308	117319	117320	117320	he	271	" Do you like this place as well as Glenbogie ? "
117323	117328	117320	117320	he	271	" Oh ; yes . "
117329	117342	117386	117386	Lucy	266	" Perhaps you will be glad to get back to London again ? "
117343	117348	117320	117320	he	271	" Oh ; no . "
117349	117358	117320	117320	he	271	" Which do you like best , then ? "
117359	117367	117386	117386	Lucy	266	" They are all so nice , if-- "
117368	117374	117320	117320	he	271	" If what , Lucy ? "
117375	117385	117320	117320	he	271	" Cælum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt , "
117409	117428	117400	117400	she	266	" I should like one as well as the other , Uncle Tom , if things went comfortably . "
117429	117438	117439	117439	he	271	" There 's a great deal in that , "
117442	117460	117439	117439	he	271	" I suppose the meaning is , that you do not get on well with your aunt ? "
117461	117474	117400	117400	she	266	" I am afraid she is angry with me , Uncle Tom . "
117475	117503	117400	117400	she	266	" Why do you make her angry , Lucy ? When she tells you what is your duty , why do you not endeavour to do it ? "
117504	117514	117516	117516	Lucy	266	" I can not do what she tells me , "
117518	117535	117400	117400	she	266	" and , as I can not , I think I ought not to be here . "
117536	117545	117400	117400	she	266	" Have you anywhere else to go to ? "
117559	117584	117548	117548	she	266	" When you say you ought not to be here , what idea have you formed in your own mind as to the future ? "
117585	117596	117400	117400	she	266	" That I shall marry Mr. Hamel , some day . "
117597	117637	117548	117548	she	266	" Do you think it would be well to marry any man without an income to live upon ? Would it be a comfort to him seeing that he had just enough to maintain himself , and no more ? "
117710	117717	117723	117723	his	271	" Love is all very well , "
117727	117760	117723	117723	his	271	" but love should be regulated by good sense . It is a crime when two beggars think of marrying each other,--two beggars who are not prepared to live as beggars do . "
117761	117768	117770	117770	Lucy	266	" He is not a beggar , "
117774	117783	117770	117770	Lucy	266	" He has begged nothing ; nor have I. "
117784	117787	117789	117790	Sir Thomas	271	" Pshaw ! "
117792	117820	117789	117790	Sir Thomas	271	" I was laying down a general rule . I did not mean to call anybody a beggar . You should n't take me up like that . "
117821	117830	117831	117831	she	266	" I beg your pardon , Uncle Tom , "
117835	117846	117831	117831	she	266	" Very well ; very well ; that will do . "
117905	117914	117892	117892	he	271	" I suppose you write to him sometimes . "
117915	117918	117920	117920	Lucy	266	" Yes , "
117924	117984	117920	117920	Lucy	266	" Write to him at once , and tell him to come and see me in Lombard Street on Tuesday , at two o'clock . Give me the letter , and I will take care it is sent to him directly I get to town . Now you had better go in , for it is getting very cold . "
118561	118564	118566	118566	he	271	" Colonel , "
118576	118600	118566	118566	he	271	" I wonder if you could give me half - an - hour before breakfast . It is a matter of great importance . "
118614	118648	118604	118604	he	271	" An hour if you like , my dear boy . I am generally up soon after six , and am always out on horseback before breakfast as soon as the light serves . "
118649	118672	118604	118604	he	271	" Then if you 'll have me called at half - past seven I shall be ever so much obliged to you . "
118700	118711	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" Upon my word that is a pretty little trinket , "
118723	118728	118730	118730	Tom	271	" Three hundred guineas ! "
118738	118742	118730	118730	Tom	271	" I daresay . "
118743	118786	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" That is , it would have been three hundred guineas unless I had come down with the ready . I made the fellow give me twenty per cent . off . You should always remember this when you are buying jewelry . "
118787	118811	118730	118730	Tom	271	" And what is to be done with this pretty thing ? I suppose it is intended for some fair lady 's neck . "
118812	118818	118730	118730	Tom	271	" Oh , of course . "
118819	118860	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" And why has it been brought down to Aldershot ? There are plenty of fellows about this place who will get their hands into your pocket if they know that you have such a trinket as that about you . "
118861	118871	118873	118873	Tom	271	" I will tell you why I brought it , "
118878	118911	118873	118873	Tom	271	" It is , as you say , for a young lady . I intend to make that young lady my wife . Of course this is a secret , you know . "
118912	118923	118925	118925	Stubbs	385	" It shall be sacred as the Pope 's toe , "
118927	118948	118925	118925	Stubbs	385	" Do n't joke about it , Colonel , if you please . It 's life and death to me . "
118949	118968	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" I 'll keep your secret and will not joke . Now what can I do for you . "
118969	118993	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" I must send this as a present with a letter . I must first tell you that she has,--well , refused me . "
118994	119006	118925	118925	Stubbs	385	" That never means much the first time , old boy . "
119007	119043	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" She has refused me half - a - dozen times , but I mean to go on with it . If she refuses me two dozen times I 'll try her a third dozen . "
119044	119052	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" Then you are quite in earnest ? "
119053	119092	118925	118925	Stubbs	385	" I am . It 's a kind of thing I know that men laugh about , but I do n't mind telling you that I am downright in love with her . The governor approves of it . "
119093	119101	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" She has got money , probably ? "
119102	119151	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" Not a shilling;--not as much as would buy a pair of gloves . But I do n't love her a bit the less for that . As to income , the governor will stump up like a brick . Now I want you to write the letter . "
119152	119166	119172	119172	he	2361	" It 's a kind of thing a third person ca n't do , "
119181	119190	119172	119172	he	2361	" Why not ? Yes , you can . "
119191	119239	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" Do it yourself , and say just the simplest words as they come up . They are sure to go further with any girl than what another man may write . It is impossible that another man should be natural on such a task as that . "
119240	119250	119252	119252	Tom	271	" Natural ! I do n't know about natural , "
119268	119297	119252	119252	Tom	271	" I do n't know that a letter that was particularly natural would please her . A touch of poetry and romance would go further than anything natural . "
119298	119304	119306	119307	the Colonel	2361	" Who is the lady ? "
119322	119329	119306	119307	the Colonel	2361	" She is my cousin,--Ayala Dormer . "
119330	119333	118713	118714	the Colonel	2361	" Who ? "
119334	119355	119252	119252	Tom	271	" Ayala Dormer;--my cousin . She was at Rome , but I do not think you ever saw her there . "
119356	119363	119365	119366	the Colonel	2361	" I have seen her since , "
119368	119377	119365	119366	the Colonel	2361	" Have you ? I did n't know . "
119378	119389	119252	119252	Tom	271	" She was with my aunt , the Marchesa Baldoni . "
119390	119412	119252	119252	Tom	271	" Dear me ! So she was . I never put the two things together . Do n't you admire her ? "
119413	119431	119433	119433	he	2361	" Certainly I do . My dear fellow , I ca n't write this letter for you . "
119456	119470	119433	119433	he	2361	" You may take it as settled that I can not write it . "
119471	119474	119252	119252	Tom	271	" No ? "
119475	119510	119252	119252	Tom	271	" Impossible . One man should never write such a letter for another man . You had better give the thing in person,--that is , if you mean to go on with the matter . "
119511	119520	119522	119522	Tom	271	" I shall certainly go on with it , "
119526	119547	119522	119522	Tom	271	" After a certain time , you know , reiterated offers do , you know,--do,--do,--partake of the nature of persecution . "
119548	119561	119252	119252	Tom	271	" Reiterated refusals are the sort of persecution I do n't like . "
119562	119597	119252	119252	Tom	271	" It seems to me that Ayala,--Miss Dormer . I mean,--should be protected by a sort of feeling,--feeling of -- of what I may perhaps call her dependent position . She is peculiarly,--peculiarly situated . "
119598	119618	119252	119252	Tom	271	" If she married me she would be much better situated . I could give her everything she wants . "
119619	119631	119632	119632	Tom	271	" It is n't an affair of money , Mr. Tringle . "
119664	119671	119672	119672	he	271	" When a man offers everything , "
119675	119692	119672	119672	he	271	" and asks for nothing , I do n't think he should be said to persecute . "
119693	119710	119644	119644	he	271	" After a time it becomes persecution . I am sure Ayala would feel it so . "
119711	119725	119727	119727	Tom	271	" My cousin ca n't suppose that I am ill - using her , "
119732	119734	119731	119733	the " Ayala	287	" Ayala "
119742	119745	119739	119739	he	271	" Mister . "
119746	119823	119727	119727	Tom	271	" Miss Dormer , I meant . I can have nothing further to say about it . I ca n't write the letter , and I should not imagine that Ayala,--Miss Dormer,--would be moved in the least by any present that could possibly be made to her . I must go out now , if you do n't mind , for half - an - hour ; but I shall be back in time for breakfast . "
120563	120578	120579	120579	he	271	" Aunt Dosett , I want you to do me a very great favour , "
120587	120597	120598	120598	she	3859	" Are you going to a party , Tom , "
120601	120661	120598	120598	she	3859	" A party ! No,--who gives a party in London at this time of the day ? Oh , you mean because I have just got a few things on . When I call anywhere I always do . I have got another lady to see , a lady of rank , and so I just made a change . "
120668	120678	120598	120598	she	3859	" What can I do for you , Tom ? "
120679	120688	120690	120690	he	271	" I want you to look at that . "
120713	120721	120723	120724	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do believe they are diamonds , "
120726	120757	120723	120724	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Yes ; they are diamonds . I am not the sort of fellow to get anything sham . What do you think that little thing cost , Aunt Dosett ? "
120758	120770	120598	120598	she	3859	" I have n't an idea . Sixty pounds , perhaps ! "
120771	120795	120598	120598	she	3859	" Sixty pounds ! Do you go into a jeweller 's shop and see what you could do among diamonds with sixty pounds ! "
120796	120808	120723	120724	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I never do go into jewellers ' shops , Tom . "
120809	120850	120598	120598	she	3859	" Nor I , very often . It 's a sort of place where a fellow can drop a lot of money . But I did go into one after this . It do n't look much , does it ? "
120851	120857	120598	120598	she	3859	" It is very pretty . "
120858	120883	120723	120724	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I think it is pretty . Well , Aunt Dosett , the price for that little trifle was three -- hundred -- guineas ! "
120899	120908	120888	120888	he	3861	" You gave three hundred guineas for it ! "
120909	120948	120598	120598	she	3859	" I went with ready money in my hand , when I tempted the man with a cheque to let me have it for two hundred and fifty pounds . In buying jewelry you should always do that . "
120949	120955	120957	120958	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I never buy jewelry , "
120962	120988	120957	120958	Mrs. Dosett	285	" If you should , I mean . Now , I 'll tell you what I want you to do . This is for Ayala . "
120989	120993	120598	120598	she	3859	" For Ayala ! "
120994	121083	120598	120598	she	3859	" Yes , indeed . I am not the fellow to stick at a trifle when I want to carry my purpose . I bought this the other day and gave ready money for it,--two hundred and fifty pounds,--on purpose to give it to Ayala . In naming the value,--of course you 'll do that when you give it her,--you might as well say three hundred guineas . That was the price on the ticket . I saw it myself,--so there wo n't be any untruth you know . "
121084	121092	120957	120958	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Am I to give it her ? "
121093	121126	120598	120598	she	3859	" That 's just what I want . When I talk to her she flares up , and , as likely as not , she 'd fling the necklace at my head . "
121127	121137	120598	120598	she	3859	" She would n't do that , I hope . "
121138	121183	120957	120958	Mrs. Dosett	285	" It would depend upon how the thing went . When I do talk to her it always seems that nothing I say can be right . Now , if you will give it her you can put in all manner of pretty things . "
121184	121193	121195	121196	Mrs. Dosett	285	" This itself will be the prettiest thing , "
121198	121233	121195	121196	Mrs. Dosett	285	" That 's just what I was thinking . Everybody agrees that diamonds will go further with a girl than anything else . When I told the governor he quite jumped at the idea . "
121234	121243	120598	120598	she	3859	" Sir Thomas knows you are giving it ? "
121244	121277	121195	121196	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Oh , dear , yes . I had to get the rhino from him . I do n't go about with two hundred and fifty pounds always in my own pocket . "
121278	121295	121298	121299	Mrs. Dosett	285	" If he had sent the money to Ayala how much better it would have been , "
121301	121413	121298	121299	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't think that at all . Who ever heard of making a present to a young lady in money . Ayala is romantic , and that would have been the most unromantic thing out . That would not have done me the least good in the world . It would simply have gone to buy boots and petticoats and such like . A girl would never be brought to think of her lover merely by putting on a pair of boots . When she fastens such a necklace as this round her throat he ought to have a chance . Do n't you think so , Aunt Dosett ? "
121414	121423	121425	121426	the aunt	1448	" Tom , shall I tell you something ? "
121428	121436	121425	121426	the aunt	1448	" What is it , Aunt Dosett ? "
121437	121448	121298	121299	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't believe that you have a chance . "
121449	121455	121456	121456	he	3864	" Do you mean that ? "
121461	121465	121456	121456	he	3864	" I do . "
121466	121477	121298	121299	Mrs. Dosett	285	" You think that the necklace will do no good ? "
121478	121533	121456	121456	he	3864	" Not the least . Of course I will offer it to her if you wish it , because her uncle and I quite approve of you as a husband for Ayala . But I am bound to tell you the truth . I do not think the necklace will do you any good . "
121581	121588	121589	121589	she	287	" Am I to give it ? "
121592	121595	121597	121597	he	3864	" Yes , "
121606	121614	121597	121597	he	3864	" give it her all the same . "
121615	121623	121589	121589	she	287	" From you or from Sir Thomas ? "
121624	121658	121659	121659	he	3864	" Oh , from me;--from me . If she were told it came from the governor she 'd keep it whether or no . I am sure I hope she will keep it , "
121677	121688	121690	121691	Mrs. Dosett	285	" You may be sure she will not keep it , "
121693	121746	121690	121691	Mrs. Dosett	285	" unless she should intend to accept your hand . Of that I can hold out no hope to you . There is a matter , Tom , which I think I should tell you as you are so straightforward in your offer . Another gentleman has asked her to marry him . "
121747	121753	121755	121755	Tom	271	" She has accepted him ! "
121757	121771	121755	121755	Tom	271	" No , she has not accepted him . She has refused him . "
121772	121781	121783	121783	Tom	271	" Then I 'm just where I was , "
121785	121823	121783	121783	Tom	271	" She has refused him , but I think that she is in a sort of way attached to him ; and though he too has been refused I imagine that his chance is better than yours . "
121824	121832	121834	121834	Tom	271	" And who the d---- is he ? "
121845	121848	121850	121851	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Tom ! "
121853	121872	121850	121851	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I beg your pardon ; but you see this is very important . Who is the fellow ? "
121873	121881	121783	121783	Tom	271	" He is one Colonel Jonathan Stubbs . "
121882	121885	121783	121783	Tom	271	" Who ? "
121886	121891	121850	121851	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Colonel Jonathan Stubbs . "
121892	121907	121783	121783	Tom	271	" Impossible ! It ca n't be Colonel Stubbs . I know Colonel Stubbs . "
121908	121936	121783	121783	Tom	271	" I can assure you it is true , Tom . I have had a letter from a lady,--a relative of Colonel Stubbs,--telling me the whole story . "
121937	121941	121942	121942	he	271	" Colonel Stubbs ! "
121945	121958	121942	121942	he	271	" That passes anything I ever heard . She has refused him ? "
121959	121967	121783	121783	Tom	271	" Yes , she has refused him . "
121968	121976	121783	121783	Tom	271	" And has not accepted him since ? "
121977	121986	121783	121783	Tom	271	" She certainly has not accepted him yet . "
121987	121998	122000	122000	Tom	271	" You may give her the bracelet all the same , "
122157	122165	122166	122166	she	287	" Of course it must go back , "
122218	122226	122227	122227	he	270	" Your cousin sends her kind regards , "
122230	122242	122227	122227	he	270	" but can not bring herself to accept your magnificent present . "
122349	122352	122354	122356	the " Mister	8735	" Ayala , "
122355	122358	122354	122356	the " Mister	8735	" Mister , "
122753	122758	122751	122751	he	271	" punch the Colonel 's head";--not
122768	122775	122766	122766	he	271	" punch the Colonel 's head , "
122883	122890	122891	122892	his father	1095	" Did you send that jewelry ? "
122899	122906	122891	122892	his father	1095	" Yes ; I sent it . "
122907	122916	122891	122892	his father	1095	" And what has now become of it ? "
122917	122925	122891	122892	his father	1095	" It is in my desk there . "
122926	122934	122891	122892	his father	1095	" Did she send it back again ? "
122935	122961	122891	122892	his father	1095	" It came back . My Uncle Dosett brought it . I do not want to say anything more about it , if you please . "
122962	123001	123002	123002	Tom	271	" I am sorry for that , Tom;--very sorry . As you had set your heart upon it I wish it could have been as you would have it . But the necklace should not be left there . "
123009	123040	123002	123002	Tom	271	" You had better let me have the necklace . It is not that I should grudge it to you , Tom , if it could do you any good . "
123041	123049	122891	122892	his father	1095	" You shall have it , Sir . "
123050	123062	123002	123002	Tom	271	" It will be better so . That was the understanding . "
123533	123541	123542	123542	he	271	" You 'll dine here , Faddle ? "
123574	123580	123582	123582	Faddle	486	" I suppose I shall , "
123584	123611	123582	123582	Faddle	486	" but ai n't we coming it a little strong ? They want to know at the Gardens what the deuce it is I 'm about . "
123636	123647	123649	123649	Tom	271	" I 've given up all that kind of thing , "
123651	123659	123649	123649	Tom	271	" Your people are not in London . "
123660	123700	123582	123582	Faddle	486	" It will make no difference when they do come up . I call an evening in the bosom of one 's family about the slowest thing there is . The bosom must do without me for the future . "
123701	123710	123649	123649	Tom	271	" Wo n't your governor cut up rough ? "
123711	123761	123649	123649	Tom	271	" He must cut up as he pleases . But I rather fancy he knows all about it . I sha n't spend half as much money this way as if I had a house and wife and family,--and what we may call a bosom of one 's own . "
124072	124075	124076	124076	he	271	" Faddle , "
124083	124125	124076	124076	he	271	" of course I know that I 'm a ruined man . Of course I 'm aware that all this is only a prelude to some ignominious end . I have not sunk to this kind of thing without feeling it . "
124126	124138	124139	124139	Faddle	486	" You 'll be right enough some day , old fellow , "
124143	124155	124139	124139	Faddle	486	" I shall live to be godfather to the first boy . "
124156	124161	124162	124162	Tom	271	" Never , Faddle ! "
124165	124232	124162	124162	Tom	271	" All those hopes have vanished . You 'll never live to see any child of mine . And I know well where to look for my enemy . Stubbs indeed ! I 'll Stubbs him . If I can only live to be revenged on that traitor then I shall die contented . Though he shot me through the heart , I should die contented . "
124599	124602	124603	124603	he	1095	" Tom , "
124606	124612	124603	124603	he	1095	" this is very bad ! "
124613	124620	124622	124622	Tom	271	" It is bad , Sir , "
124624	124644	124622	124622	Tom	271	" You have disgraced me , and your mother , and yourself . You have disgraced Travers and Treason ! "
124651	124668	124648	124648	his	353	" It will be necessary , I fear , that you should leave the house altogether . "
124676	124741	124669	124669	Tom	271	" A young man who has been locked up in prison for a week for maltreating a policeman can hardly expect to be entrusted with such concerns as those of Travers and Treason . I and your poor mother can not get rid of you and the disgrace which you have entailed upon us . Travers and Treason can easily get rid of you . "
124778	124790	124792	124793	Sir Thomas	271	" What have you got to say for yourself , Sir ? "
124795	124804	124806	124806	Tom	271	" Of course , I 'm very sorry , "
124808	124855	124806	124806	Tom	271	" Sorry , Tom ! A young man holding your position in Travers and Treason ought not to have to be sorry for having been locked up in prison for a week for maltreating a policeman ! What do you think must be done , yourself ? "
124856	124868	124754	124754	Travers	469	" The man had been hauling me about in the street . "
124869	124877	124754	124754	Travers	469	" You were drunk , no doubt . "
124878	124914	124806	124806	Tom	271	" I had been drinking . I am not going to tell a lie about it . But he need n't have done as he did . Faddle knows that , and can tell you . "
124915	125014	124754	124754	Travers	469	" What can have driven you to associate with such a young man as Faddle ? That is the worst part of it . Do you know what Faddle and Company are,--stock jobbers , who ten years ago had n't a thousand pounds in the way of capital among them ! They 've been connected with a dozen companies , none of which are floating now , and have made money out of them all ! Do you think that Travers and Treason will accept a young man as a partner who associates with such people as that ? "
125015	125033	124754	124754	Travers	469	" I have seen old Faddle 's name and yours on the same prospectus together , Sir . "
125034	125108	124806	124806	Tom	271	" What has that to do with it ? You never saw him inside our counter . What a name to appear along with yours in such an affair as this ! If it had n't been for that , you might have got over it . Young men will be young men . Faddle ! I think you will have to go abroad for a time , till it has been forgotten . "
125109	125122	125124	125124	Tom	271	" I should like to stay , just at present , Sir , "
125126	125133	125124	125124	Tom	271	" What good can you do ? "
125134	125147	124806	124806	Tom	271	" All the same , I should like to stay , Sir . "
125148	125313	124754	124754	Travers	469	" I was thinking that , if you were to take a tour through the United States , go across to San Francisco , then up to Japan , and from thence through some of the Chinese cities down to Calcutta and Bombay , you might come back by the Euphrates Valley to Constantinople , see something of Bulgaria and those countries , and so home by Vienna and Paris . The Euphrates Valley Railway will be finished by that time , perhaps , and Bulgaria will be as settled as Hertfordshire . You 'd see something of the world , and I could let it be understood that you were travelling on behalf of Travers and Treason . By the time that you were back , people in the City would have forgotten the policeman , and if you could manage to write home three or four letters about our trade with Japan and China , they would be willing to forget Faddle . "
125314	125318	125124	125124	Tom	271	" But , Sir-- "
125319	125330	124806	124806	Tom	271	" Should n't you like a tour of that kind ? "
125331	125337	124754	124754	Travers	469	" Very much indeed , Sir;--only-- "
125338	125344	125124	125124	Tom	271	" Only what , Tom ? "
125345	125348	125350	125350	Tom	271	" Ayala ! "
125365	125449	125350	125350	Tom	271	" Tom , do n't be a fool . You ca n't make a young woman have you if she does n't choose . I have done all that I could for you , because I saw that you 'd set your heart upon it . I went to her myself , and then I gave two hundred and fifty pounds for that bauble . I am told I shall have to lose a third of the sum in getting rid of it . "
125450	125466	125468	125468	Tom	271	" Ricolay told me that he 'd take it back at two hundred and twenty , "
125488	125496	125498	125499	Sir Thomas	271	" Never mind that for the present , "
125501	125565	125498	125499	Sir Thomas	271	" Do n't you remember the old song?--'If she will , she will , you may depend on't . And if she wo n't she wo n't ; and there 's an end on't . ' You ought to be a man and pluck up your spirits . Are you going to allow a little girl to knock you about in that way ? "
125601	125633	125634	125634	Tom	271	" We 've done what we could about it , and now it is time to give it over . Let me hear you say that you will give it over . "
125641	125653	125655	125656	Sir Thomas	271	" Speak the word , and the thing will be done , "
125665	125670	125672	125672	Tom	271	" I ca n't , "
125676	125679	125672	125672	Tom	271	" Nonsense ! "
125680	125690	125655	125656	Sir Thomas	271	" I have tried , and I ca n't . "
125691	125721	125672	125672	Tom	271	" Tom , do you mean to say that you are going to lose everything because a chit of a girl like that turns up her nose at you ? "
125722	125735	125737	125737	Tom	271	" It 's no use my going while things are like this , "
125739	125776	125737	125737	Tom	271	" If I were to get to New York , I should come back by the next ship . As for letters about business , I could n't settle my mind to anything of the kind . "
125777	125790	125792	125793	the father	757	" Then you 're not the man I took you to be , "
125795	125802	125804	125804	Tom	271	" I could be man enough , "
125810	125820	125804	125804	Tom	271	" if I could get hold of Colonel Stubbs . "
125821	125825	125672	125672	Tom	271	" Colonel who ? "
125826	125995	125997	125997	he	3966	" Stubbs ! Jonathan Stubbs ! I know what I 'm talking about . I 'm not going to America , nor China , nor anything else , till I 've polished him off . It 's all very well your abusing me , but you do n't know what it is I have suffered . As for being called a man I do n't care about it . What I should like best would be to get Ayala on one side and Stubbs on the other , and then all three to go off the Duke of York 's Column together . It 's no good talking about Travers and Treason . I do n't care for Travers and Treason as I am now . If you 'll get Ayala to say that she 'll have me , I 'll go to the shop every morning at eight and stay till nine ; and as for the Mountaineers it may all go to the d---- for me . "
126697	126808	126692	126692	Isadore	310	" I do not know what Uncle Tom intends , but he means to be kind . Of course you must go to him , and if I were you I would tell him everything about everything . He is not strict and hard like Aunt Emmeline . She means to be good too , but she is sometimes so very hard . I am happier now because I think something will be done to relieve you from the terrible weight which I am to you . I sometimes wish that you had never come to me in Kensington Gardens , because I have become such a burden to you . "
127510	127517	127519	127521	a young man	1151	" Oh , you 're Hamel , "
127603	127611	127613	127613	Hamel	310	" That is my name , Sir , "
127615	127636	127613	127613	Hamel	310	" Here is my card . Perhaps you will do me the kindness to take it to Sir Thomas Tringle . "
127637	127681	127682	127682	Tom	271	" All right , old fellow ; I know all about it . He has got Puxley with him from the Bank of England just at this moment . Come through into this room . He 'll soon have polished off old Puxley . "
127728	127742	127744	127744	Tom	271	" So you and Lucy are going to make a match of it , "
127803	127815	127817	127817	Hamel	310	" I am here in obedience to directions from Sir Thomas , "
127831	127846	127817	127817	Hamel	310	" Of course you are . Perhaps you do n't know who I am ? "
127847	127853	127855	127855	Hamel	310	" Not in the least , "
127857	127865	127867	127867	Tom	271	" I am Thomas Tringle , junior , "
127876	127887	127889	127889	Hamel	310	" I beg your pardon ; I did not know , "
127891	127900	127902	127902	Tom	271	" You and I ought to be thick , "
127904	127920	127902	127902	Tom	271	" because I 'm going in for Ayala . Perhaps you 've heard that before ? "
127996	128001	127995	127995	he	271	was--"going in for Ayala . "
128031	128034	128029	128029	he	310	" going in "
128061	128068	128070	128071	Sir Thomas	271	" And now , Mr. Hamel , "
128078	128083	128074	128074	his	271	" how are you ? "
128103	128156	128074	128074	his	271	" I am not so young as I was , Mr. Hamel . My years are heavier and so is my work . That 's the worst of it . When one is young and strong one very often has n't enough to do . I daresay you find it so sometimes . "
128157	128162	128164	128164	Hamel	310	" In our profession , "
128166	128183	128164	128164	Hamel	310	" we go on working , though very often we do not sell what we do . "
128184	128189	128191	128192	Sir Thomas	271	" That 's bad , "
128194	128240	128191	128192	Sir Thomas	271	" It is the case always with an artist before he has made a name for himself . It is the case with many up to the last day of a life of labour . An artist has to look for that , Sir Thomas . "
128241	128258	128164	128164	Hamel	310	" Dear me ! That seems very sad . You are a sculptor , I believe ? "
128259	128265	128191	128192	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , Sir Thomas . "
128266	128283	128164	128164	Hamel	310	" And the things you make must take a deal of room and be very heavy . "
128291	128310	128286	128287	Mr. Hamel	310	" Do n't you think if you were to call an auction you 'd get something for them ? "
128332	128384	128329	128329	his	271	" If you and half - a - dozen other beginners made a sort of gallery among you , people would buy them as they do those things in the Marylebone Road and stick them up somewhere about their grounds . It would be better than keeping them and getting nothing . "
128598	128606	128608	128609	Sir Thomas	271	" And now about this young lady ? "
128628	128655	128619	128619	he	271	" It 's a bad look out for her when , as you say , you can not sell your work when you 've done it . "
128656	128670	128608	128609	Sir Thomas	271	" I think you do not quite understand the matter , Sir Thomas . "
128671	128734	128619	128619	he	271	" Perhaps not . It certainly does seem unintelligible that a man should lumber himself up with a lot of things which he can not sell . A tradesman would know that he must get into the bankruptcy court if he were to go on like that . And what is sauce for the goose will be sauce for the gander also . "
128744	128759	128741	128741	his	310	" If you ca n't sell your wares how can you keep a wife ? "
128760	128804	128608	128609	Sir Thomas	271	" My wares , as you call them , are of two kinds . One , though no doubt made for sale , is hardly saleable . The other is done to order . Such income as I make comes from the latter . "
128805	128808	128810	128811	Sir Thomas	271	" Heads , "
128813	128820	128810	128811	Sir Thomas	271	" Busts they are generally called . "
128821	128849	128619	128619	he	271	" Well , busts . I call them heads . They are heads . A bust , I take it , is -- well , never mind . "
128863	128888	128850	128851	Sir Thomas	271	" A man wants to have something more or less like some one to put up in a church and then he pays you . "
128889	128910	128810	128811	Sir Thomas	271	" Or perhaps in his library . But he can put it where he likes when he has bought it . "
128911	128932	128619	128619	he	271	" Just so . But there ai n't many of those come in your way , if I understand right . "
128933	128942	128810	128811	Sir Thomas	271	" Not as many as I would wish . "
128943	128960	128961	128961	Lucy	266	" What can you net at the end of the year ? That 's the question . "
129026	129039	129017	129017	he	271	" It varies with various circumstances , but it is very small . "
129040	129049	129017	129017	he	271	" Very small ? Five hundred a year ? "
129083	129089	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" Oh dear , no , "
129093	129097	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" Four hundred ? "
129098	129119	129017	129017	he	271	" Nor four hundred,--nor three . I have never netted three hundred in one year after paying the incidental expenses . "
129120	129150	129017	129017	he	271	" That seems to me to be uncommonly little for a young man who is thinking of marrying . Do n't you think you had better give it up ? "
129151	129160	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" I certainly think nothing of the kind . "
129161	129170	129017	129017	he	271	" Does your father do anything for you ? "
129171	129176	129017	129017	he	271	" Nothing at all . "
129177	129183	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" He also makes heads ? "
129184	129189	129017	129017	he	271	" Heads,--and other things . "
129190	129200	129017	129017	he	271	" And sells them when he has made them . "
129201	129234	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" Yes , Sir Thomas ; he sells them . He had a hard time once , but now he is run after . He refuses more orders than he can accept . "
129235	129245	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" And he wo n't do anything for you . "
129246	129255	129017	129017	he	271	" Nothing . He has quarreled with me . "
129256	129278	129091	129091	Hamel	310	" That is very bad . Well now , Mr. Hamel , would you mind telling me what your ideas are ? "
129467	129586	129457	129457	he	271	" My idea is that I shall marry Miss Dormer , and support her on the earnings of my profession . My idea is that I shall do so before long , in comfort . My idea also is , that she will be the last to complain of any discomfort which may arise from my straitened circumstances at present . My idea is that I am preparing for myself a happy and independent life . My idea also is,--and I assure you that of all my ideas this is the one to which I cling with the fondest assurance,--that I will do my very best to make her life happy when she comes to grace my home . "
129636	129654	129655	129655	Hamel	310	" Am I to understand that you intend to marry on something under three hundred a year ? "
129665	129675	129676	129676	he	271	" How am I to answer such a question , "
129682	129707	129676	129676	he	271	" seeing that Miss Dormer is in your hands , and that you are unlikely to be influenced by anything that I may say ? "
129708	129716	129718	129719	Sir Thomas	271	" I shall be very much influenced , "
129721	129753	129718	129719	Sir Thomas	271	" Were her father still alive , I think we should have put our heads together , and between us decided on what might have been best for Lucy 's happiness . "
129754	129766	129768	129769	Sir Thomas	271	" Do you think that I 'm indifferent to her happiness ? "
129771	129779	129781	129781	Hamel	310	" I should have suggested to him , "
129789	129878	129781	129781	Hamel	310	" that she should remain in her own home till I could make one for her worthy of her acceptance . And then we should have arranged among us what would have been best for her happiness . I can not do this with you . If you tell her to - morrow that she must give up either your protection or her engagement with me , then she must come to me , and make the best of all the little that I can do for her . "
129879	129891	129893	129894	Sir Thomas	271	" Who says that I 'm going to turn her out ? "
129902	129916	129893	129894	Sir Thomas	271	" I do not think that any one has said this of you . "
129917	129928	129781	129781	Hamel	310	" Then why do you throw it in my teeth ? "
129929	129937	129893	129894	Sir Thomas	271	" Because your wife has threatened it . "
129947	129970	129939	129940	Sir Thomas	271	" No one has threatened it . It is untrue . You are guilty both of impertinence and untruth in saying so . "
129984	130010	129981	129981	his	271	" Stop , young man , and hear what I have to say to you . I have done nothing but good to my niece . "
130011	130112	129781	129781	Hamel	310	" Nevertheless , it is true , Sir Thomas , that she has been told by your wife that she must either abandon me or the protection of your roof . I find no fault with Lady Tringle for saying so . It may have been the natural expression of a judicious opinion . But when you ask after my intentions in reference to your niece I am bound to tell you that I propose to subject her to the undoubted inconveniences of my poor home , simply because I find her to be threatened with the loss of another . "
130113	130122	129981	129981	his	271	" She has not been threatened , Sir . "
130123	130187	130190	130190	he	4055	" You had better ask your wife , Sir Thomas . And , if you find that what I have said is true , I think you will own that I have been obliged to explain myself as I have done . As you have told me to my face that I have been guilty of untruth , I shall now leave you . "
130517	130526	130491	130491	he	271	" I NEVER THREATENED TO TURN YOU OUT . "
130779	130787	130775	130775	I	0	" Not five hundred a - year ! "
130788	130793	130755	130755	he	7375	" Not four ! ! "
130794	130800	130755	130755	he	7375	" Not three ! ! ! "
130801	130814	130815	130815	You	4073	" Oh , heavens ! and you propose to take a wife ! "
130945	130948	130955	130955	he	7375	" wares , "
132316	132325	132313	132313	she	282	herself,--"all the fat was again in the fire . "
132372	132384	132386	132387	Lady Tringle	282	" After all Ayala was not half as bad as Lucy , "
132389	132400	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" There , mamma , I think you are wrong , "
132407	132428	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" Of all the upsetting things I ever knew Ayala was the worst . Think of her conduct with Septimus . "
132446	132453	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" And then with that Marchesa ! "
132454	132462	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" That was the Marchesa 's fault . "
132463	132468	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" And with Tom ! "
132469	132522	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" I do n't think she was so much to blame with Tom . If she were , why does n't she take him now she can have him ? He is just as foolish about her as ever . Upon my word I think Tom will make himself ill about it . "
132523	132533	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" You have n't heard it all , mamma . "
132534	132541	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" What have n't I heard ? "
132542	132553	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" Ayala has been down with the Alburys at Stalham . "
132554	132560	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" I did hear that . "
132561	132583	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" And another man has turned up . What on earth they see in her is what I ca n't understand . "
132584	132596	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" Another man has offered to her ! Who is he ? "
132597	132716	132429	132430	Lady Tringle	282	" There was a Colonel Stubbs down there . Septimus heard it all from young Batsby at the club . She got this man to ride about the country with her everywhere , going to the meets with him and coming home . And in this way she got him to propose to her . I do n't suppose he means anything ; but that is why she wo n't have anything to do with Tom now . Do you mean to say she did n't do all she could to catch Tom down at Glenbogie , and then at Rome ? Everybody saw it . I do n't think Lucy has ever been so bad as that . "
132717	132726	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" It 's quite different , my dear . "
132727	132736	132738	132741	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" She has come from a low father , "
132745	132787	132738	132741	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" and therefore she has naturally attached herself to a low young man . There is nothing to be wondered at in that . I suppose they are fond of each other , and the sooner they are married the better . "
132788	132801	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" But he ca n't marry her because he has got nothing . "
132802	132808	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" Papa will do something . "
132809	132896	132738	132741	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" That 's just what your papa wo n't . The man has been to your father in the City and there has been ever such a row . He spoke ill of me because I endeavoured to do my duty by the ungrateful girl . I am sure I have got a lesson as to taking up other people 's children . I endeavoured to do an act of charity , and see what has come of it . I do n't believe in charity . "
132897	132924	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" That is wicked , mamma . Faith , Hope , and Charity ! But you 've got to be charitable before you begin the others . "
132925	132954	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" I do n't think it is wicked . People would do best if they were made to go along on what they 've got of their own . "
132969	132980	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" Of course I know what you mean , mamma . "
132981	132988	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" I did n't mean anything . "
132989	133018	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" But , if people ca n't stay for a few weeks in their own parents ' houses , I do n't know where they are to stay . "
133019	133055	132402	132405	the Honourable Mrs. Traffick	330	" It is n't weeks , Augusta ; it 's months . And as to parents , Lord Boardotrade is Mr. Traffick 's parent . Why does n't he go and stay with Lord Boardotrade ? "
133184	133188	133189	133189	she	266	" Aunt Emmeline , "
133194	133202	133189	133189	she	266	" I want to ask you something ? "
133203	133209	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" What is it now ? "
133216	133221	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" About Mr. Hamel . "
133222	133244	133189	133189	she	266	" I do n't want to hear any more about Mr. Hamel . I have heard quite enough of Mr. Hamel . "
133245	133257	133189	133189	she	266	" Of course I am engaged to him , Aunt Emmeline . "
133258	133293	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" So I hear you say . I do not think it very dutiful of you to come and talk to me about him , knowing as you do what I think about him . "
133294	133315	133189	133189	she	266	" What I want to ask is this . Ought I to stay here or ought I to go away ? "
133316	133338	133189	133189	she	266	" I never heard such a girl ! Where are you to go to ? What makes you ask the question ? "
133339	133356	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Because you said that I ought to go if I did not give him up . "
133357	133365	133189	133189	she	266	" You ought to give him up . "
133366	133375	133189	133189	she	266	" I can not do that , aunt . "
133376	133445	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Then you had better hold your tongue and say nothing further about it . I do n't believe he earns enough to give you bread to eat and decent clothes to wear . What would you do if children were to come year after year ? If you really love him I wonder how you can think of being such a millstone round a man 's neck ! "
133465	133478	133462	133462	his	4133	" I do not for a moment believe that we should want . "
133479	133492	133211	133212	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I have never for one moment doubted my own ultimate success . "
134382	134386	134388	134388	he	734	" My dear , "
134390	134423	134388	134388	he	734	" have you got your thick boots on ? Then go and put 'em on . We will go down to the Lodge , and then come home round by Windover Hill . "
134436	134443	134445	134445	he	734	" I want to tell you , "
134447	134461	134445	134445	he	734	" that this Mr. Hamel of yours came to me in Lombard Street . "
134462	134470	134388	134388	he	734	" I know that , Uncle Tom . "
134471	134487	134388	134388	he	734	" He has written to you , then , and told you all about it ? "
134488	134503	134445	134445	he	734	" He has written to me , certainly , and I have answered him . "
134504	134553	134388	134388	he	734	" No doubt . Well , Lucy , I had intended to be kind to your Mr. Hamel , but , as you are probably aware , I was not enabled to carry out my intentions . He seems to be a very independent sort of young man . "
134554	134562	134388	134388	he	734	" He is independent , I think . "
134563	134648	134445	134445	he	734	" I have not a word to say against it . If a man can be independent it is so much the better . If a man can do everything for himself , so as to require neither to beg nor to borrow , it will be much better for him . But , my dear , you must understand that a man can not be independent with one hand , and accept assistance with the other , at one and the same time . "
134649	134660	134662	134662	Lucy	266	" That is not his character , I am sure , "
134677	134699	134670	134670	she	266	" I do not think it is . Therefore he must remain independent , and I can do nothing for him . "
134700	134708	134445	134445	he	734	" He knows that , Uncle Tom . "
134709	134763	134670	134670	she	266	" Very well . Then there 's an end of it . I only want to make you understand that I was willing to assist him , but that he was unwilling to be assisted . I like him all the better for it , but there must be an end of it . "
134764	134772	134670	134670	she	266	" I quite understand , Uncle Tom . "
134773	134804	134823	134823	he	4158	" Then there 's one other thing I 've got to say . He accused me of having threatened to turn you out of my house . Now , my dear-- "
134825	134853	134823	134823	he	4158	her,--"Just hear me out till I 've done , and then there need not be another word about it . I never threatened to turn you out . "
134854	134861	134862	134862	she	266	" Not you , Uncle Tom , "
134874	134898	134862	134862	she	266	" If your aunt said a word in her anger you should not have made enough of it to write and tell him . "
134899	134919	134823	134823	he	4158	" I thought she meant me to go , and then I did n't know whom else to ask . "
134920	135107	134862	134862	she	266	" Neither I nor she , nor anybody else , ever intended to turn you out . I have meant to be kind to you both,--to you and Ayala ; and if things have gone wrong I can not say that it has been my fault . Now , you had better stay here , and not say a word more about it till he is ready to take you . That ca n't be yet for a long time . He is making , at present , not more than two hundred a year . And I am sure it must be quite as much as he can do to keep a coat on his back with such an income as that . You must make up your mind to wait,--probably for some years . As I told you before , if a man chooses to have the glory of independence he must also bear the inconvenience . Now , my dear , let there be an end of this , and never say again that I want to turn you out of my house . "
135198	135210	135211	135211	he	271	" There is something going to be up with your father , "
135229	135237	135239	135242	the Member of Parliament	4162	" It would be a great convenience , "
135244	135269	135239	135242	the Member of Parliament	4162	" if he could be made to hold his tongue till Parliament meets ; but I 'm afraid that 's too good to expect . "
135647	135650	135652	135654	an altered man	4178	" the governor "
136268	136283	136250	136250	she	7356	" It would all be right if it were not for that accursed Stubbs , "
136292	136357	136285	136285	Tom	271	" The man whom I called my friend ! The man I lent a horse to when he could n't get one anywhere else ! The man to whom I confided everything , even about the necklace ! If it had n't been for Stubbs I never should have hurt that policeman ! When I was striking him I thought that it was Stubbs ! "
137478	137485	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" What is it , now ? "
137491	137521	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" I hope you are going back to Travers and Treason 's . That is what I should do , and walk in just as though nothing had happened . "
137522	137533	137470	137470	Faddle	486	" Not if you were me , you would n't . "
137534	137544	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" That does make a difference , of course . "
137545	137570	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" There is something else to be done before I can again darken the doors of Travers and Treason,--if I should ever do so ! "
137571	137575	137470	137470	Faddle	486	" Something particular ? "
137576	137592	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" Something very particular . Faddle , I do think you are a true friend . "
137593	137681	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" You may say that . I have stuck to you always,--though you do n't know the kind of things my people say to me about it . They say I am going to ruin myself because of you . The governor threatened to put me out of the business altogether . But I 'm a man who will be true to my friend , whatever happens . I think you have been a little cool to me , lately ; but even that do n't matter . "
137682	137721	137470	137470	Faddle	486	" Cool ! If you knew the state that I 'm in you would n't talk of a fellow being cool ! I 'm so knocked about it all that I do n't know what I 'm doing . "
137722	137730	137487	137489	the faithful friend	4267	" I do take that into consideration . "
137731	137745	137747	137747	he	4268	" Now , I 'll tell you what I am going to do . "
137785	137798	137747	137747	he	4268	" Faddle , I 'll shoot that fellow down like a dog . "
137799	137805	137747	137747	he	4268	" Will you , indeed ? "
137806	137849	137747	137747	he	4268	" Like a dog;--if I can get at him . I should have no more compunction in taking his life than a mere worm . Why should I , when I know that he has sapped the very juice of my existence ? "
137850	137862	137747	137747	he	4268	" Do you mean,--do you mean,--that you would -- murder him ? "
137863	137894	137747	137747	he	4268	" It would not be murder . Of course it might be that he would shoot me instead . Upon the whole , I think I should like that best . "
137895	137901	137903	137903	Faddle	486	" Oh ; a duel ! "
137905	137992	137903	137903	Faddle	486	" That 's what I mean . Murder him ! Certainly not . Though I should like nothing half so well as to thrash him within an inch of his life . I would not murder him . My plan is this,--I shall write to him a letter inviting him to meet me in any corner of the globe that he may select . Torrid zone or Arctic circle will be all the same to me . You will have to accompany me as my second . "
138038	138044	138046	138046	Tom	271	" But first of all , "
138048	138057	138046	138046	Tom	271	" you will have to carry a letter . "
138058	138063	138065	138065	Faddle	486	" To the Colonel ? "
138067	138158	138065	138065	Faddle	486	" Of course . The man is now staying with friends of his named Albury at a place called Stalham . From what I hear they are howling swells . Sir Harry Albury is Master of the Hounds , and Lady Albury when she is up in London has all the Royal Family constantly at her parties . Stubbs is a cousin of his ; but you must go right away up to him among 'em all , and deliver the letter into his hands without minding 'em a bit . "
138159	138167	138046	138046	Tom	271	" Could n't it go by post ? "
138168	138222	138046	138046	Tom	271	" No ; this kind of letter musn't go by post . You have to be able to swear that you delivered it yourself into his own hands . And then you must wait for an answer . Even though he should want a day to think of it , you must wait . "
138223	138232	138065	138065	Faddle	486	" Where am I to stay , Tom ? "
138233	138325	138046	138046	Tom	271	" Well ; it may be they 'll ask you to the house , because , though you carry the letter for me , you are not supposed to be his enemy . If so , put a jolly face on it , and enjoy yourself as well as you can . You must seem , you know , to be just as big a swell as anybody there . But if they do n't ask you , you must go to the nearest inn . I 'll pay the bill . "
138326	138334	138336	138336	Faddle	486	" Shall I go to - day ? "
138338	138400	138336	138336	Faddle	486	" I 've got to write the letter first . It 'll take a little time , so that you 'd better put it off till to - morrow . If you will leave me now I 'll write it , and if you will come back at six we 'll go and have a bit of dinner at Bolivia 's . "
138429	138440	138441	138441	Tom	271	" Why not come to the Mountaineers , old boy ? "
138791	138824	138825	138825	He	271	" I am quite sure , however , that a man who bears the colours of a colonel in the British army will not try to get off by such a pretext . "
139108	139111	139117	139117	they	4291	" howling swells "
139167	139171	139162	139174	a fellow to be as " big a swell " as anybody else	4295	" big a swell "
139911	139916	139917	139917	he	2361	" My dear friend , "
139924	139949	139917	139917	he	2361	" you might as well take it for granted . I shall go after my princess with all the energy which a princess merits . "
139950	139960	139962	139963	Lady Albury	413	" The question is whether she be a princess , "
139965	140007	139962	139963	Lady Albury	413	" Allow me to say that that is a point on which I can not admit a doubt . She is a princess to me , and just at present I must be regarded as the only judge in the matter . "
140008	140019	140021	140022	Lady Albury	413	" She shall be a goddess , if you please , "
140024	140113	140021	140022	Lady Albury	413	" Goddess , princess , pink , or pearl;--any name you please supposed to convey perfection shall be the same to me . It may be that she is in truth no better , or more lovely , or divine , than many another young lady who is at the present moment exercising the heart of many another gentleman . You know enough of the world to be aware that every Jack has his Gill . She is my Gill , and that 's an end of it . "
140114	140125	139962	139963	Lady Albury	413	" I hope then that she may be your Gill . "
140126	140167	140021	140022	Lady Albury	413	" And , in order that she may , you must have her here again . I should absolutely not know how to go to work were I to find myself in the presence of Aunt Dosett in Kingsbury Crescent . "
140265	140270	140272	140273	the servant	4332	" Yes , Sir ; "
140275	140292	140272	140273	the servant	4332	" He says he has a letter which he must put into your own particular hands . "
140293	140300	140302	140303	Lady Albury	413	" That looks like a bailiff , "
140535	140539	140541	140541	he	385	" Colonel Stubbs , "
140548	140589	140541	140541	he	385	" I am directed by my friend , Mr. Thomas Tringle , junior , to put this letter into your own hand . When you have read it I shall be ready to consult with you as to its contents . "
140684	140694	140695	140695	he	2361	" This is from my friend , Tom Tringle , "
140698	140706	140708	140708	Faddle	486	" From Mr. Thomas Tringle , junior , "
140712	140761	140708	140708	Faddle	486	" So I perceive . I am sorry to think that he should be in so much trouble . He is one of the best fellows I know , and I am really grieved that he should be unhappy . This , you know , is all nonsense . "
140762	140773	140695	140695	he	2361	" It is not nonsense at all , Colonel Stubbs . "
140774	140862	140708	140708	Faddle	486	" You must allow me to be the judge of that , Mr. Faddle . It is at any rate nonsense to me . He wants me to go somewhere and fight a duel,--which I should not do with any man under any circumstances . Here there is no possible ground for any quarrel whatsoever,--as I will endeavour to explain , myself , to my friend , Mr. Tringle . I shall be sure to write to him at once,--and so I will bid you good afternoon . "
140878	140912	140870	140871	poor Faddle	486	" I thought it probable that you would write , Colonel Stubbs , and therefore I am prepared to wait . If I can not be accommodated here I will wait,--will wait elsewhere . "
140913	140932	140695	140695	he	2361	" That will not be at all necessary . We have a post to London twice a day . "
140933	140954	140695	140695	he	2361	" You must be aware , Colonel Stubbs , that letters of this sort should not be sent by post . "
140955	140985	140870	140871	poor Faddle	486	" The kind of letter I shall write may be sent by post very well . It will not be bellicose , and therefore there can be no objection . "
140986	141006	140695	140695	he	2361	" I really think , Colonel Stubbs , that you are making very little of a very serious matter . "
141007	141045	140695	140695	he	2361	" Mr. Faddle , I really must manage my own affairs after my own way . Would you like a glass of sherry ? If not , I need hardly ask you to stay here any longer . "
141177	141188	141189	141189	he	486	" I pity him from the bottom of my heart , "
141208	141315	141192	141193	Lady Albury	413	" Not at all . Unless he really loved her he would n't have been so enraged . I suppose he does think that I injured him . He did tell me his story , and I did n't tell him mine . I can understand it all , though I did n't imagine he was such a fool as to invite me to travel all round the world because of the harsh laws of Great Britain . Nevertheless , I shall write to him quite an affectionate letter , remembering that , should I succeed myself , he will be my first cousin by marriage . "
141704	141706	141703	141707	the " swells " of	4371	" swells "
141722	141738	141673	141673	they	4369	received--"after going all the way down there , hardly to be asked to sit down ! "
141739	141746	141673	141673	they	4369	" Not asked to sit down ! "
141747	141828	141673	141673	they	4369	" Well , yes , I was;--on a miserable cane - bottomed chair in a sort of cupboard . And he did n't sit down . You may call them swells , but I think your Colonel Stubbs is a very vulgar sort of fellow . When I told him the post is n't the proper thing for such a letter , he only laughed . I suppose he does n't know what is the kind of thing among gentlemen . "
141829	141837	141839	141839	Tom	272	" I should think he does know , "
141841	141877	141839	141839	Tom	272	" Then why does n't he act accordingly ? Would you believe it ; he never so much as asked me whether I had a mouth on . It was just luncheon time , too . "
141878	141885	141673	141673	they	4369	" I suppose they lunch late . "
141886	141996	141839	141839	Tom	272	" They might have asked me . I should n't have taken it . He did say something about a glass of sherry , but it was in that sort of tone which tells a fellow that he is expected not to take it . And then he pretended to laugh . I could see that he was shaking in his shoes at the idea of having to fight . He go to the torrid zone ! He would much rather go to a police office if he thought that there was any fighting on hand . I should dust his jacket with a stick if I were you . "
142327	142336	142312	142312	Tringle	272	" Show a fellar fellar 's letters morrer . "
142669	142683	142684	142684	he	272	" I suppose it was n't to be expected that he should tell , "
142689	142731	142684	142684	he	272	" Perhaps I should n't have told in the same place . But as to forgetting animosity that is out of the question ! How is a man to forget his animosity when two men want to marry the same girl ? "
143879	143889	143891	143891	she	404	" O. P. Q. , Post Office , Hastings , "
144062	144069	144070	144070	she	404	" And so you have come , "
144073	144116	144050	144050	he	344	" Oh , yes ; I have come . I was sure to come when I said so . No man is more punctual than I am in these matters . I should have come before,--only I did not get your letter . "
144117	144122	144030	144031	no one	833	" Oh , Frank ! "
144123	144149	144050	144050	he	344	" Well , my darling . You are looking uncommonly well , and I am so glad to see you . How are they all ? "
144150	144153	144050	144050	he	344	" Frank ! "
144154	144159	144030	144031	no one	833	" What is it ? "
144160	144171	144050	144050	he	344	" Oh , Frank , what are we to do ? "
144172	144185	144050	144050	he	344	" The governor will give way at last , I should say . "
144186	144201	144030	144031	no one	833	" Never;--that is while we are as we are now . If we were married-- "
144202	144214	144050	144050	he	344	" Ah,--I wish we were ! Would n't it be nice ? "
144215	144222	144050	144050	he	344	" Do you really think so ? "
144223	144241	144050	144050	he	344	" Of course I do . I 'm ready to - morrow for the matter of that . "
144242	144250	144030	144031	no one	833	" But could you do something great ? "
144251	144284	144050	144050	he	344	" Something great ! As to earning my bread , you mean ? I do not think I could do that . I did n't turn my hand to it early enough . "
144285	144295	144050	144050	he	344	" I was n't thinking of -- your bread . "
144296	144304	144030	144031	no one	833	" You said,--could I do something great ? "
144305	144354	144050	144050	he	344	" Frank , I wrote you a letter and described it all . How I got the courage to do it I do not know . I feel as though I could not bring myself to say it now . I wonder whether you would have the courage . "
144355	144386	144050	144050	he	344	" I should say so . I do n't know quite what sort of thing it is ; but I generally have pluck enough for anything in a common way . "
144387	144396	144030	144031	no one	833	" This is something in an uncommon way . "
144397	144419	144030	144031	no one	833	" I could n't break open Travers and Treason , and get at the safe , or anything in that way . "
144420	144449	144050	144050	he	344	" It is another sort of safe of which you must break the lock , Frank ; another treasure you must steal . Do you not understand me ? "
144450	144456	144030	144031	no one	833	" Not in the least . "
144457	144462	144464	144464	Gertrude	404	" There is Tom , "
144466	144487	144464	144464	Gertrude	404	" He is always wandering about the place now like a ghost . Let us go back to the gate . "
144492	144507	144489	144489	Frank	344	" You heard , I suppose , of that dreadful affair about the policeman . "
144508	144518	144050	144050	he	344	" There was a row , I was told . "
144519	144529	144050	144050	he	344	" Did you feel that the family were disgraced ? "
144530	144552	144489	144489	Frank	344	" Not in the least . He had to pay five shillings,--hadn't he,--for telling a policeman to go about his business ? "
144553	144560	144562	144562	Gertrude	404	" He was -- locked up , "
144566	144617	144562	144562	Gertrude	404	" It 's just the same . Nobody thinks anything about that kind of thing . Now , what is it I have got to do ? We had better turn back again as soon as we can , because I must go up to the house before I go . "
144618	144622	144489	144489	Frank	344	" You will ? "
144623	144666	144050	144050	he	344	" Certainly . I will not leave it to your father to say that I came skulking about the place , and was ashamed to show my face . That would not be the way to make him give you your money . "
144667	144680	144489	144489	Frank	344	" I am sure he 'd give it,--if we were once married . "
144681	144703	144489	144489	Frank	344	" If we were married without having it assured before hand we should look very blue if things went wrong afterwards . "
144704	144713	144489	144489	Frank	344	" I asked you whether you had courage . "
144714	144774	144050	144050	he	344	" Courage enough , I think , when my body is concerned ; but I am an awful coward in regard to money . I would n't mind hashed mutton and baked potatoes for myself , but I should n't like to see you eating them , dearest , after all the luxuries to which you have been accustomed . "
144775	144783	144489	144489	Frank	344	" I should think nothing of it . "
144784	144837	144489	144489	Frank	344	" Did you ever try ? I never came absolutely to hashed mutton , but I 've known how very uncomfortable it is not to be able to pay for the hot joints . I 'm willing to own honestly that married life without an income would not have attractions for me . "
144838	144847	144489	144489	Frank	344	" But if it was sure to come ? "
144848	144865	144050	144050	he	344	" Ah , then indeed,--with you ! I have just said how nice it would be . "
144866	144874	144875	144875	she	4456	" Have you ever been at Ostend ? "
144880	144912	144875	144875	she	4456	" Ostend . Oh , yes . There was a man there who used to cheat horribly at écarté . He did me out of nearly a hundred pounds one night . "
144913	144925	144050	144050	he	344	" But there 's a clergyman there , I 'm told . "
144926	144964	144050	144050	he	344	" I do n't think this man was in orders . But he might have been . Parsons come out in so many shapes ! This man called himself a count . It was seven years ago . "
144965	144974	144050	144050	he	344	" I am speaking of to - day . "
144975	144983	144050	144050	he	344	" I 've not been there since . "
144984	144993	144050	144050	he	344	" Would you like to go there,--with me ? "
144994	145028	144050	144050	he	344	" It is n't a nice sort of place , I should say , for a honeymoon . But you shall choose . When we are married you shall go where you like . "
145029	145034	145035	145035	she	4457	" To be married ! "
145038	145049	145035	145035	she	4457	" Married at Ostend ! Would your mother like that ? "
145050	145057	144050	144050	he	344	" Mother ! Oh , dear ! "
145058	145096	144050	144050	he	344	" I 'll be shot if I know what you 're after , Gertrude . If you 've got anything to say you 'd better speak out . I want to go up to the house now . "
145231	145234	145235	145235	she	404	" Frank , "
145238	145256	145235	145235	she	404	" if you were to run away with me , then we could be married at Ostend . "
145257	145263	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" Run away with you ! "
145264	145280	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" It would n't be the first time that such a thing has been done . "
145281	145311	145235	145235	she	404	" The commonest thing in the world , my dear , when a girl has got her money in her own hands . Nothing I should like so much . "
145312	145330	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" Money ! It 's always money . It 's nothing but the money , I believe . "
145331	145338	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" That 's unkind , Gertrude . "
145339	145353	145235	145235	she	404	" Ai n't you unkind ? You wo n't do anything I ask . "
145354	145372	145235	145235	she	404	" My darling , that hashed mutton and those baked potatoes are too clear before my eyes . "
145373	145386	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" You think of nothing , I believe , but your dinner . "
145387	145511	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" I think , unfortunately , of a great many other things . Hashed mutton is simply symbolical . Under the head of hashed mutton I include poor lodgings , growlers when we get ourselves asked to eat a dinner at somebody 's table , limited washing - bills , table - napkins rolled up in their dirt every day for a week , antimacassars to save the backs of the chairs , a picture of you darning my socks while I am reading a newspaper hired at a halfpenny from the public - house round the corner , a pint of beer in the pewter between us,--and perhaps two babies in one cradle because we ca n't afford to buy a second . "
145512	145518	145235	145235	she	404	" Do n't , Sir . "
145519	145539	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" In such an emergency I am bound to give you the advantage both of my experience and imagination . "
145540	145543	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" Experience ! "
145544	145580	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" Not about the cradles ! That is imagination . My darling , it wo n't do . You and I have not been brought up to make ourselves happy on a very limited income . "
145581	145592	145593	145593	she	4466	" Papa would be sure to give us the money , "
145598	145621	145593	145593	she	4466	" In such a matter as this , where your happiness is concerned , my dear , I will trust no one . "
145622	145626	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" My happiness ! "
145627	145679	145194	145198	a man of the world	4464	" Yes , my dear , your happiness ! I am quite willing to own the truth . I am not fitted to make you happy , if I were put upon the hashed mutton regime as I have described to you . I will not run the risk,--for your sake . "
145680	145688	145689	145689	she	4466	" For your own , you mean , "
145692	145707	145689	145689	she	4466	" Nor for my own , if you wish me to add that also . "
145722	145731	145732	145732	she	4466	" What is it you intend , then ? "
145735	145744	145732	145732	she	4466	" I will ask your father once again . "
145745	145756	145757	145757	she	4466	" He will simply turn you out of the house , "
146181	146197	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" Well , Mr. Houston , what can I do for you to - day ? "
146209	146219	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" It is the old story , Sir Thomas . "
146220	146248	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" Do n't you think , Mr. Houston , that there is something,--a little,--unmanly shall I call it , in coming so often about the same thing ? "
146249	146268	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" No , Sir Thomas , I do not . I think my conduct has been manly throughout . "
146269	146310	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" Weak , perhaps , would have been a better word . I do not wish to be uncourteous , and I will therefore withdraw unmanly . Is it not weak to encounter so many refusals on the same subject ? "
146311	146334	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" I should feel myself to have been very strong if after so many refusals I were to be successful at last . "
146335	146345	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" There is not the least chance of it . "
146346	146362	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" Why should there be no chance if your daughter 's happiness depends upon it ? "
146363	146397	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" There is no chance , because I do not believe that my daughter 's happiness does depend upon it . She is foolish , and has made a foolish proposition to you . "
146398	146402	146404	146404	Houston	344	" What proposition ? "
146417	146448	146404	146404	Houston	344	" That journey to Ostend , with the prospect of finding a good - natured clergyman in the town ! I hardly think you would be fool enough for that . "
146449	146467	146469	146469	he	344	" No , Sir Thomas , I should not do that . I should think it wrong . "
146495	146567	146199	146202	the man of business	4487	" I am sure you would think it foolish : and it would be foolish . I pledge you my word , that were you to do such a thing I should not give you a shilling . I should not let my girl starve ; but I should save her from suffering in such a manner as to let you have no share of the sustenance I provided for her . "
146568	146577	146579	146579	Frank	344	" There is no question of that kind , "
146583	146615	146579	146579	Frank	344	" I hope not;--only as I know that the suggestion has been made I have thought it well to tell you what would be my conduct if it were carried out . "
146616	146626	146628	146628	Frank	344	" It will not be carried out by me , "
146630	146680	146628	146628	Frank	344	" Very well ; I am glad to hear it . To tell the truth , I never thought that you would run the risk . A gentleman of your sort , when he is looking for a wife with money , likes to have the money quite certain . "
146681	146685	146687	146687	Frank	344	" No doubt , "
146695	146851	146687	146687	Frank	344	" And now , Mr. Houston , let me say one word more to you and then we may part , as I hope , good friends . I do not mean my daughter Gertrude to marry any man such as you are;--by that I mean an idle gentleman without means . Should she do so in my teeth she would have to bear the punishment of sharing that poor gentleman 's idleness and poverty . While I lived she would not be allowed absolutely to want , and when I died there would be some trifle for her , sufficient to keep the wolf from the door . But I give you my solemn word and honour that she shall never be the means of supplying wealth and luxury to such a husband as you would be . I have better purposes for my hard - earned money . Now , good - day . "

150381	150390	150378	150378	she	510	" Frank Houston is coming here on Sunday . "
150391	150394	150396	150397	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Frank ! "
150399	150415	150378	150378	she	510	" I thought we were to consider ourselves as altogether separated from that fortunate youth . "
150416	150423	150378	150378	she	510	" I do n't see why . "
150424	150487	150378	150378	she	510	" Well ; he left us not with the kindest possible feelings in the Tyrol ; and he has allowed ever so many months to pass by without coming to see us . I asked Mudbury whether we should have him to dinner one day last week , and he said it would be better to let him go his own way . "
150488	150498	150378	150378	she	510	" Nevertheless , he is coming here on Sunday . "
150499	150506	150378	150378	she	510	" Has he written to you ? "
150507	150532	150378	150378	she	510	" Yes , he has written to me,--in answer to a line from me . I told him that I wished to see him . "
150533	150538	150378	150378	she	510	" Was that wise ? "
150539	150548	150378	150378	she	510	" Wise or not , I did so . "
150549	150558	150378	150378	she	510	" Why should you wish to see him ? "
150559	150571	150378	150378	she	510	" Am I to tell you the truth or a lie ? "
150572	150594	150378	150378	she	510	" Not a lie , certainly . I will not ask for the truth if the truth be unpalatable to you . "
150595	150626	150378	150378	she	510	" It is unpalatable;--but yet I might as well tell it you . I wrote to ask him to come and see me , because I love him so dearly . "
150627	150632	150378	150378	she	510	" Oh , Imogene ! "
150633	150639	150378	150378	she	510	" It is the truth . "
150640	150647	150378	150378	she	510	" Did you tell him so ? "
150648	150734	150378	150378	she	510	" No ; I told him nothing . I merely said , that , if this match was over between him and that girl of Sir Thomas Tringle , then he might come and see me again . That was all that I said . His letter was very much longer , but yet it did not say much . However , he is to come , and I am prepared to renew our engagement should he declare that he is willing to do so . "
150735	150741	150378	150378	she	510	" What will Mudbury say ? "
150742	150811	150378	150378	she	510	" I do not care very much what he says . I do not know that I am bound to care . If I have resolved to entangle myself with a long engagement , and Mr. Houston is willing to do the same , I do not think that my brother should interfere . I am my own mistress , and am dealing altogether with my own happiness . "
150812	150823	150378	150378	she	510	" Imogene , we have discussed this so often before . "
150824	150911	150378	150378	she	510	" Not a doubt ; and with such effect that with my permission Frank was enabled to ask this young woman with a lot of money to marry him . Had it been arranged , I should have had no right to find fault with him , however sore of heart I might have been . All that has fallen through , and I consider myself quite entitled to renew my engagement again . I shall not ask him , you may be sure of that . "
150912	150922	150378	150378	she	510	" It comes to the same thing , Imogene . "
150923	151016	150378	150378	she	510	" Very likely . It often happens that ladies mean that to be expressed which it does not become them to say out loud . So it may be with me on this occasion . Nevertheless , the word , if it have to be spoken , will have to be spoken by him . What I want you to do now is to let me have the drawing - room alone at three o'clock on Sunday . If anything has to be said it will have to be said without witnesses . "
151574	151587	151567	151568	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I 'm blessed if Benjamin is n't smitten with that girl ! "

151834	151844	151845	151845	she	413	" Do you mean to say he told you ? "
151848	151851	151853	151854	Sir Harry	415	" No , "
151856	151907	151853	151854	Sir Harry	415	" he is not at all the man to do that . In such a matter he is sure to have a great secret , and be sure also to let his secret escape in every word that he speaks . You will find that what I say is truth . "
152062	152065	152066	152066	he	290	" Rosalind , "
152073	152084	152066	152066	he	290	" what do you think I have to tell you ? "
152100	152112	152113	152113	she	413	" I hope Mrs. Motherly has not written to you again , "
152147	152198	152116	152117	Mrs. Motherly	519	" Oh , dear ; nothing of that kind . I do not care a straw for Mrs. Motherly or the girl either . I never said a word to her that any one could make a handle of . But I want to say a word to somebody now . "
152199	152211	152144	152144	his	290	" What sort of word is it to be , Ben ? "
152212	152215	152216	152216	he	290	" Ah , "
152219	152237	152216	152216	he	290	" Rosalind , you must understand that I never was so much in earnest in my life ! "
152238	152245	152144	152144	his	290	" You are always in earnest . "
152252	152266	152247	152247	he	290	" I shall expect you to help me through this matter , Rosalind . "
152267	152275	152144	152144	his	290	" Do I not always help you ? "
152276	152304	152144	152144	his	290	" Yes ; you do . But you must stick to me now like wax . What do you think of that young lady , Miss Dormer ? "
152305	152324	152247	152247	he	290	" I think she is a pretty girl ; and the gentlemen tell me that she rides bravely . "
152325	152333	152334	152334	he	4635	" Do n't you consider her divine ? "
152337	152377	152334	152334	he	4635	" My dear Ben , one lady never considers another to be divine . Among ourselves we are terribly human , if not worse . Do you mean to tell me that you are in love with Ayala Dormer ? "
152378	152384	152386	152386	he	4635	" You have guessed it , "
152388	152395	152386	152386	he	4635	" You always do guess everything . "
152396	152422	152247	152247	he	290	" I generally do guess as much as that , when young gentlemen find young ladies divine . Do you know anything about Miss Dormer ? "
152423	152452	152247	152247	he	290	" Nothing but her beauty;--nothing but her wit;--nothing but her grace ! I know all that , and I do n't seem to want to know any more . "
152453	152475	152386	152386	he	4635	" Then you must be in love ! In the first place she has n't got a sixpence in the world . "
152476	152483	152485	152486	the Captain	3130	" I do n't want sixpences , "
152490	152516	152485	152486	the Captain	3130	" And in the next place I am not at all sure that you would like her people . Father and mother she has none . "
152517	152525	152386	152386	he	4635	" Then I can not dislike them . "
152526	152577	152386	152386	he	4635	" But she has uncles and aunts , who are , I am afraid , objectionable . She lives with a Mr. Dosett , who is a clerk in Somerset House,--a respectable man , no doubt , but one whom you would not perhaps want at your house very often . "
152578	152588	152590	152591	Captain Batsby	290	" I do n't care about uncles and aunts , "
152593	152635	152590	152591	Captain Batsby	290	" Uncles and aunts can always be dropped much easier than fathers and mothers . At any rate I am determined to go on , and I want you to put me in the way . How must I find her ? "
152636	152696	152702	152703	the Captain	3130	" Go to No . 10 , Kingsbury Crescent , Bayswater . Ask for Mrs. Dosett and tell her what you 've come about . When she knows that you are well off she will not turn a deaf ear to you . What the girl may do it is beyond me to say . She is very peculiar . "
152697	152700	152702	152703	the Captain	3130	" Peculiar ? "
152850	152865	152866	152866	she	287	" I can write a line to Mrs. Dosett , if you wish it , "
152869	152875	152866	152866	she	287	" or to Miss Dormer . "
152876	152928	152959	152959	She	413	" I wish you would . It would be best to the aunt , and just tell her that I am fairly well off . She 'll tell Ayala I could make quite a proper settlement on her . That kind of thing does go a long way with young ladies . "
152929	152938	152940	152941	Lady Albury	413	" It ought to do at any rate , "
152943	152952	152940	152941	Lady Albury	413	" It certainly does with the old ladies . "
153013	153029	152992	152992	She	413	" And if she should accept me you 'll have her down here , Rosalind ? "
153099	153118	153120	153121	the lover	3798	" And , if she should n't take me all at once , still you might have her , "
153373	153383	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" Captain Batsby ! I do n't believe it ! "
153415	153424	153408	153408	she	287	" You can read Lady Albury 's letter . "
153425	153490	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" I do n't want to read Lady Albury 's letter . I wo n't see him . I do n't care what my uncle says . I do n't care what anybody says . Yes , I do know him . I remember him very well . I spoke to him once or twice , and I did not like him at all . "
153491	153500	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" You said the same of Colonel Stubbs . "
153501	153522	153408	153408	she	287	" I did n't say the same of Colonel Stubbs . He is a great deal worse than Colonel Stubbs . "
153523	153533	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" And you said just the same of Tom . "
153534	153588	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" He is the same as Tom;--just as bad . It is no good going on about him , Aunt Margaret . I wo n't see him . If I were locked up in a room with him I would n't speak a word to him . He has no right to come . "
153589	153614	153408	153408	she	287	" A gentleman , my dear , has always a right to ask a lady to be his wife if he has got means . "
153615	153664	153385	153385	Ayala	287	" You always say so , Aunt Margaret , but I do n't believe it . There should be,--there should have been,--I do n't know what ; but I am quite sure the man has no right to come to me , and I wo n't see him . "
153796	153810	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" I fear that it would be of no service , Captain Batsby . "
153811	153816	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" Of no service ? "
153817	153841	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" On receiving Lady Albury 's letter I was of course obliged to tell my niece the honour you proposed to do her . "
153842	153852	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" I am quite in earnest , you know , "
153857	153888	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" So I suppose , as Lady Albury would not have written , nor would you have come on such a mission . But so is my niece in earnest . "
153889	153905	153854	153855	the Captain	3130	" She will , at any rate , hear what I have got to say . "
153906	153912	153914	153915	Mrs. Dosett	285	" She would rather not , "
153917	153958	153914	153915	Mrs. Dosett	285	" She thinks that it would only be painful to both of you . As she has quite made up her mind that she can not accept the honour you propose to do her , what good would it serve ? "
153959	153966	153968	153969	the Captain	3130	" Is Miss Dormer at home ? "
153995	154003	154005	154007	the urgent lover	4668	" I suppose she is at home , "
154009	154020	154005	154007	the urgent lover	4668	" Miss Dormer is at present in her own chamber . "
154021	154031	154033	154034	the Captain	3130	" Then I think I ought to see her , "
154036	154048	154033	154034	the Captain	3130	" She ca n't know at present what is my income . "
154049	154060	154005	154007	the urgent lover	4668	" Lady Albury has told us that it is sufficient . "
154061	154088	154033	154034	the Captain	3130	" But that means nothing . Your niece can not be aware that I have a very pretty little place of my own down in Berkshire . "
154089	154100	154102	154103	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't think it would make a difference , "
154105	154149	154102	154103	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Or that I shall be willing to settle upon her a third of my income . It is not many gentlemen who will do as much as that for a young lady , when the young lady has nothing of her own . "
154150	154159	154033	154034	the Captain	3130	" I am sure you are very generous . "
154160	154221	154005	154007	the urgent lover	4668	" Yes , I am . I always was generous . And I have no impediments to get rid of ; not a trouble of that kind in all the world . And I do n't owe a shilling . Very few young men , who have lived as much in the world as I have , can say that . "
154222	154234	154102	154103	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I am sure your position is all that is desirable . "
154235	154262	154033	154034	the Captain	3130	" That 's just it . No position could be more desirable . I should give up the service immediately as soon as I was married . "
154279	154283	154285	154286	the Captain	3130	" After that , "
154288	154307	154285	154286	the Captain	3130	" do you mean to say that I am not to be allowed to see the young lady ? "
154308	154321	154102	154103	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I can not force her to come down , Captain Batsby . "
154322	154330	154102	154103	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I would if I were you . "
154331	154337	154347	154347	he	3130	" Force a young lady ? "
154338	154345	154347	154347	he	3130	" Something ought to be done , "
154354	154414	154347	154347	he	3130	" I have come here on purpose to see her , and I am quite prepared to do what is handsome . My half - sister , Lady Albury , had her down at Stalham , and is quite anxious to have her there again . I suppose you have no objection to make to me , Mrs. Dosett ? "
154415	154421	154347	154347	he	3130	" Oh , dear no . "
154422	154427	154347	154347	he	3130	" Or Mr. Dosett ? "
154428	154472	154473	154474	The Captain	3130	" I do not say that he has , Captain Batsby ; but this is a matter in which a young lady 's word must be paramount . We can not force her to marry you , or even to speak to you . "
154572	154578	154579	154579	she	737	" As for thanking him , "
154582	154636	154579	154579	she	737	" you can do that yourself , Aunt Margaret , if you like . I am not a bit obliged to him ; but , if you choose to say so , you may ; only pray do tell him to go away,--and tell him never , never to come back any more . "
154658	154664	154666	154667	Captain Batsby	290	" In all my life , "
154675	154684	154666	154667	Captain Batsby	290	" I never heard of such conduct before . "
154721	154731	154732	154732	he	290	" As I did not succeed in seeing her , "
154744	154819	154732	154732	he	290	" of course I do not know what she might have said to me herself . I might probably have induced her to give me another hearing . I put it all down to that abominable aunt , who probably has some scheme of her own , and would not let Miss Dormer come down to me . If you will have her again at Stalham , everything may be made to go right . "
154952	154957	154959	154960	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Does she think , "
154973	154989	154967	154967	her	285	" that young men with incomes are to be coming after her always like this ? "
155036	155052	154993	154993	his	270	" Why should n't she see an eligible man when he comes recommended like this ? "
155053	155068	154967	154967	her	285	" I suppose , my dear , she did n't think him nice enough . "
155069	155179	154993	154993	his	270	" Nice ! pshaw ! I call it a direct flying in the face of Providence . If he were ever so nasty and twice as old she ought to think twice about it in her position . There is poor Tom , they say , absolutely ill . The housekeeper was over here from Queen 's Gate the other day , and she declares that that affair about the policeman all came from his being in love . And now he has left the business and has gone to Merle Park , because he is so knocked in a heap that he can not hold up his head . "
155180	155200	155202	155203	Mr. Dosett	270	" I do n't see why love should make a man punch a policeman 's breath out of him , "
155205	155254	155202	155203	Mr. Dosett	270	" Of course Tom was foolish ; but he would do very well if she would have him . Of course your sister , and Sir Thomas , and all of them , will be very furious . What right will she have to expect money after that ? "
155255	155261	155263	155264	Mr. Dosett	270	" Tom is an ass , "
155266	155382	155263	155264	Mr. Dosett	270	" I suppose Colonel Stubbs is an ass too . What I want to know is what it is she looks for . Like any other girl , she expects to get married some day , I suppose ; but she has been reading poetry , and novels , and trash , till she has got her head so full of nonsense that she does n't know what it is she does want . I should like to shake her till I shook all the romance out of her . If there is anything I do hate it is romance , while bread and meat , and coals , and washing , are so dear . "
156013	156019	156020	156020	she	493	" Now , my darling , "
156027	156053	156020	156020	she	493	" if you would not mind going away for ten minutes , I could say a few words on very particular business to your aunt . "
156220	156224	156225	156225	he	271	" My dear , "
156232	156272	156225	156225	he	271	" I find that something must be done to the chimney of the north room . The workmen must be in it by the first of February . See and have all the furniture taken out before they come . "
156645	156655	156657	156658	Sir Thomas	271	" Your brother will never put up with it , "
156766	156774	156775	156775	she	282	" It will be the only way , "
156782	156807	156775	156775	she	282	" to put Tom on his legs again . If the girl comes back here she will be sure to have him at last . "
157103	157106	157107	157107	she	282	" Margaret , "
157110	157123	157107	157107	she	282	" I have a proposition of great importance to make to you . "
157135	157155	157127	157127	her	285	" That poor girl is not,--is not,--is not doing perhaps the very best for herself here at Kingsbury Crescent . "
157156	157167	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Why is she not doing the best for herself ? "
157174	157193	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Do not for a moment suppose that I am finding fault either with you or my brother . "
157194	157204	157127	157127	her	285	" You 'd be very wrong if you did . "
157205	157283	157127	157127	her	285	" No doubt;--but I am not finding fault . I know how very generous you have both been . Of course Sir Thomas is a rich man , and what he gives to one of the girls comes to nothing . Of course it is different with you . It is hard upon my brother to have any such burden put upon him ; and it is very good both in him and you to bear it . "
157284	157297	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" What is it you want us to do now , Emmeline ? "
157298	157340	157127	157127	her	285	" Well;--I was going to explain . I do think it a great pity that Tom and Ayala should not become man and wife . If ever any young man ever did love a girl I believe that he loves her . "
157341	157347	157127	157127	her	285	" I think he does . "
157348	157445	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" It is dreadful . I never saw anything like it . He is just for all the world like those young men we read of who do all manner of horrible things for love,--smothering themselves and their young women with charcoal , or throwing them into the Regent 's Canal . I am constantly afraid of something happening . It was all because of Ayala that he got into that terrible row at the police court,--and then we were afraid he was going to take to drink . He has given all that up now . "
157446	157465	157127	157127	her	285	" I am very glad he has given drink up . That would n't do him any good . "
157466	157519	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" He is quite different now . The poor fellow hardly takes anything . He will sit all the afternoon smoking cigarettes and sipping tea . It is quite sad to see him . Then he comes and talks to me , and is always asking me to make Ayala have him . "
157520	157534	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't think that anybody can ever make Ayala do anything . "
157535	157563	157169	157170	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Not quite by talking to her . I dare say not . I did not mean to say a word to her about it just now . "
157564	157573	157575	157576	Mrs. Dosett	285	" We can do nothing , I fear , "
157578	157600	157575	157576	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I was going to suggest something . But I wanted first to say a word or two about poor Lucy . "
157607	157609	157575	157576	Mrs. Dosett	285	" poor "
157636	157642	157653	157653	she	285	" Is she in trouble ? "
157643	157652	157653	157653	she	285	" Oh , dear , yes . But , "
157681	157710	157670	157670	she	285	" she could arrange her affairs , no doubt , if she were not with us . She is engaged to that Mr. Isadore Hamel , the sculptor . "
157711	157717	157653	157653	she	285	" So I have heard . "
157718	157829	157670	157670	she	285	" He does not earn very much just at present , I fear . Sir Thomas did offer to help him , but he was perhaps a little hoity - toity , giving himself airs . That , however , did not come off , and there they are , waiting . I do n't mean to say a word against poor Lucy . I think it a pity , you know ; but perhaps it was natural enough . He is n't what I should have liked for a niece who was living with me just as though she was my daughter ; but I could n't help that . "
157830	157840	157670	157670	she	285	" But what are we to do , Emmeline ? "
157841	157849	157653	157653	she	285	" Let them just change places again . "
157850	157864	157670	157670	she	285	" Change again ! Ayala go to you and Lucy come back here ! "
157865	157905	157670	157670	she	285	" Just that . If Ayala were with us she would be sure to get used to Tom at last . And then Lucy could manage her affairs with Mr. Hamel so much better if she were with you . "
157906	157920	157653	157653	she	285	" Why should she manage her affairs better if she were with us ? "
158013	158038	157995	157996	Mrs. Dosett	285	" What I mean is , that , if she were away , Sir Thomas would be more likely to do something for her . "
158050	158069	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Do you not feel that the girls should not be chucked about like balls from a battledore ? "
158074	158111	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" For their own good , Margaret . I only propose it for their own good . You ca n't but think it would be a good thing for Ayala to be married to our Tom . "
158112	158118	158260	158261	Lady Tringle	282	" If she liked him . "
158119	158216	158260	158261	Lady Tringle	282	" Why should n't she like him ? You know what that means . Poor Ayala is young , and a little romantic . She would be a great deal happier if all that could be knocked out of her . She has to marry somebody , and the sooner she settles down the better . Sir Thomas will do anything for them;--a horse and carriage , and anything she could set her heart upon ! There is nothing Sir Thomas would not do for Tom so as to get him put upon his legs again . "
158217	158226	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I do n't think Ayala would go . "
158227	158234	158236	158237	Lady Tringle	282	" She must , you know , "
158239	158246	158236	158237	Lady Tringle	282	" if we both tell her . "
158247	158251	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" And Lucy ? "
158252	158257	158260	158261	Lady Tringle	282	" She must too , "
158263	158287	158260	158261	Lady Tringle	282	" If they are told they are to go , what else can they do ? Why should n't Ayala wish to come ? "
158288	158294	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" There were quarrels before . "
158295	158305	158306	158307	Lady Tringle	282	" Yes;--because of Augusta . Augusta is married now . "
158317	158324	158313	158313	Augusta	302	" Will you speak to Ayala ? "
158325	158342	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Perhaps it would come better from you , Margaret , if you agree with me . "
158343	158405	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I am not sure that I do . I am quite sure that your brother would not force her to go , whether she wished it or not . No doubt we should be glad if the marriage could be arranged . But we can not force a girl to marry , and her aversion in this case is so strong-- "
158406	158409	158313	158313	Augusta	302	" Aversion ! "
158410	158498	158071	158072	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Aversion to being married , I mean . It is so strong that I do not think she will go of her own accord to any house where she is likely to meet her cousin . I dare say she may be a fool . I say nothing about that . Of course , she shall be asked ; and , if she wishes to go , then Lucy can be asked too . But of course it must all depend upon what your brother says . "
158586	158592	158594	158594	Ayala	287	" Is Aunt Emmeline gone ? "
158601	158628	158594	158594	Ayala	287	" I am glad she has gone , because I never know how to look when she calls me dear . I know she hates me . "
158629	158636	158594	158594	Ayala	287	" I hope not , Ayala . "
158637	158672	158594	158594	Ayala	287	" I am sure she does , because I hated Augusta . I do hate Augusta , and my aunt hates me . The only one of the lot I like is Uncle Tom . "
158804	158813	158815	158815	Ayala	287	" And Lucy is to have the poverty ? "
158819	158840	158815	158815	Ayala	287	" I think it probable , my dear , that before long Lucy will become the wife of Mr. Hamel . "
158841	158851	158853	158853	Ayala	287	" And you want to get rid of me ? "
158855	158951	158853	158853	Ayala	287	" No , my dear ; not so . You must not think that for a moment . The proposition has not originated with me at all . I am endeavouring to do my duty by explaining to you the advantages which you would enjoy by going to your Aunt Emmeline , and which you certainly can not have if you remain here . And I must tell you , that , if you return to Sir Thomas , he will probably provide for you . You know what I mean by providing for you ? "
158952	158959	158961	158961	Ayala	287	" No , I do n't , "
159017	159055	159056	159056	she	737	" By providing , I mean that if you are living in his house he will leave you something in his will;--as would be natural that he should do for a child belonging to him . Your Uncle Reginald"--this
159064	159076	159056	159056	she	737	tone--"will , I fear , have nothing to leave to you . "
159094	159106	159087	159088	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Well , Ayala , what do you think about it ? "
159107	159112	159114	159114	Ayala	287	" Must I go ? "
159116	159121	159114	159114	Ayala	287	" May I stay ? "
159122	159137	159087	159088	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Yes , my dear ; you may certainly stay if you wish it . "
159138	159144	159146	159146	Ayala	287	" Then I will stay , "
159155	159168	159146	159146	Ayala	287	" You do not want to turn me out , Aunt Margaret ? "
159192	159205	159170	159170	she	737	" If you will keep me I will try to be good . "
159206	159258	159181	159181	her	737	" My dear , you are good . I have nothing to complain of . Of course we will keep you . Nobody has thought for a moment of bidding you go . But you should understand that when your aunt made the proposition I was bound to tell it you . "
159437	159443	159444	159444	she	266	" and you , Reginald , "
159447	159465	159444	159444	she	266	" will be relieved from a burden which never ought to have been laid upon your shoulder . "
159466	159473	159474	159474	he	1507	" We will think of it , "
159486	159492	159493	159493	he	1507	" we will think of it "
159506	159511	159474	159474	he	1507	" A COLD PROSPECT ! "
160628	160639	160584	160584	she	404	" Papa has almost yielded already . I have been very ill;"--here
160659	160663	160664	160664	she	404	significant;--"very ill indeed , "
160670	160697	160664	160664	she	404	" as you will understand if you have ever really loved me . I have kept my bed almost ever since I got your cruel letter . "
160706	160742	160664	160664	she	404	" It has made papa very unhappy , and , though he has said nothing to myself , he has told mamma that if I am really in earnest he will do something for us . "
160789	160796	160797	160798	Sir Thomas	271	" She is a stupid idiot , "
160805	160827	160797	160798	Sir Thomas	271	" If she is obedient , and does her duty , of course I shall do something for her some day . "
161095	161101	161105	161105	he	4806	" assertion was not true . "
161161	161164	161128	161130	the contumacious gentleman	4808	" false . "
161165	161168	161128	161130	the contumacious gentleman	4808	" False , "
161467	161482	161460	161460	her	404	" Very ill indeed;--as you will understand , if you ever really loved me ! "
161537	161556	161558	161558	Imogene	372	" And so Tringle père does not see the advantage of such a son - in - law , "
161612	161617	161619	161619	Frank	282	" Yes , indeed ! "
161621	161652	161619	161619	Frank	282	" The man is a fool , because he will probably get somebody who will behave less well to his daughter , and make a worse use of his money . "
161653	161672	162092	162092	he	4825	" Just so . One can only be astonished at his folly . Is there no hope left ? "
161673	161679	162063	162063	he	4825	" A glimmer there is . "
161680	161685	161619	161619	Frank	282	" Oh , indeed ! "
161686	161722	162092	162092	he	4825	" I got a letter last night from my lady - love , in which she tells me that she is very ill , and that her sickness is working upon her father 's bowels . "
161723	161726	162092	162092	he	4825	" Frank ! "
161727	161750	162063	162063	he	4825	" It is the proper language;--working upon her father 's bowels of compassion . Fathers always have bowels of compassion at last . "
161751	161760	161619	161619	Frank	282	" You will return then , of course ? "
161761	161767	162092	162092	he	4825	" What do you say ? "
161768	161776	162092	162092	he	4825	" As for myself,--or as for you ? "
161777	161795	162063	162063	he	4825	" As a discreet and trusty counsellor . To me you have always been a trusty counsellor . "
161796	161847	161619	161619	Frank	282	" Then I should put a few things into a bag , go down to Merle Park , and declare that , in spite of all the edicts that ever came from a father 's mouth , you can not absent yourself while you know that your Gertrude is ill . "
161848	161863	162092	162092	he	4825	" And so prepare a new cousin for you to press to your bosom . "
161864	161887	162092	162092	he	4825	" If you can endure her for always , why should not I for an hour or two , now and again ? "
161888	161943	162063	162063	he	4825	" Why not , indeed ? In fact , Imogene , this enduring , and not enduring,--even this living , and not living,--is , after all , but an affair of the imagination . Who can tell but , that as years roll on , she may be better - looking even than you . "
161944	161947	161619	161619	Frank	282	" Certainly . "
161948	161958	162092	162092	he	4825	" And have as much to say for herself ? "
161959	161969	162092	162092	he	4825	" A great deal more that is worth hearing . "
161970	161986	161619	161619	Frank	282	" And behave herself as a mother of a family with quite as much propriety ? "
161987	162002	162092	162092	he	4825	" In all that I do not doubt that she would be my superior . "
162003	162013	162092	162092	he	4825	" More obedient I am sure she would be . "
162014	162022	161619	161619	Frank	282	" Or she would be very disobedient . "
162023	162037	162092	162092	he	4825	" And then she can provide me and my children with ample comforts . "
162038	162055	162092	162092	he	4825	" Which I take it is the real purpose for which a wife should be married . "
162056	162059	162061	162061	he,--and	4825	" Therefore , "
162066	162075	162063	162063	he	4825	" And therefore there should be no doubt . "
162076	162082	162083	162083	he	4825	" Though I hate her , "
162095	162110	162087	162087	his	4825	" with every fibre of my heart,--still you think there should be no doubt ? "
162111	162121	162063	162063	he	4825	" That , Frank , is violent language,--and foolish . "
162122	162145	162063	162063	he	4825	" And though I love you so intensely that whenever I see her the memory of you becomes an agony to me . "
162146	162157	162184	162184	he	4825	" Such language is only more violent and more foolish . "
162158	162182	162063	162063	he	4825	" Surely not , if I have made up my mind at last , that I never will willingly see Miss Tringle again . "
162242	162246	162247	162247	he	4825	" Surely not , "
162250	162281	162247	162247	he	4825	" if I have made up my mind at last , that nothing shall ever again serve to rob me of your love,--if I may still hope to possess it . "
162282	162287	162288	162288	she	4826	" Oh , Frank ! "
162291	162311	162288	162288	she	4826	" how mean I am to be a creature obedient to the whistle of such a master as you ! "
162312	162318	162247	162247	he	4825	" But are you obedient ? "
162319	162407	162425	162425	she	4828	" You know that well enough . I have had no Gertrude with whom I have vacillated , whether for the sake of love or lucre . Whatever you may be,--whether mean or noble,--you are the only man with whom I can endure to live , for whom I would endure to die . Of course I had not expected that your love should be like mine . How should it be so , seeing that you are a man and that I am but a woman . "
162440	162446	162447	162447	she	4828	" Sit there , Frank , "
162450	162482	162425	162425	she	4828	" so that we may look into each other 's faces and talk seriously . Is it to come to this then , that I am to ruin you at last ? "
162483	162490	162425	162425	she	4828	" There will be no ruin . "
162491	162515	162425	162425	she	4828	" But there will , if we are married now . Shall I tell you the kind of life which would satisfy me ? "
162516	162522	162523	162523	he	4827	" Some little place abroad ? "
162526	162594	162523	162523	he	4827	" Oh , dear , no ! No place to which you would be confined at all . If I may remain as I am , knowing that you intend to marry no one else , feeling confident that there is a bond binding us together even though we should never become man and wife , I should be , if not happy , at least contented . "
162595	162602	162425	162425	she	4828	" That is a cold prospect . "
162603	162686	162523	162523	he	4827	" Cold;--but not ice - cold , as would have been the other . Cold , but not wretchedly cold , as would be the idea always present to me that I had reduced you to poverty . Frank , I am so far selfish that I can not bear to abandon the idea of your love . But I am not so far selfish as to wish to possess it at the expense of your comfort . Shall it be so ? "
162687	162691	162693	162693	he	4829	" Be how ? "
162700	162742	162693	162693	he	4829	" Let us remain just as we are . Only you will promise me , that as I can not be your wife there shall be no other . I need hardly promise you that there will be no other husband . "
162768	162777	162778	162778	she	4830	" If this will be enough for you , "
162781	162789	162778	162778	she	4830	" it shall be enough for me . "
162790	162796	162693	162693	he	4829	" No , by G----d ! "
162797	162800	162778	162778	she	4830	" Frank ! "
162801	162823	162778	162778	she	4830	" It will certainly not be enough for me . I will have nothing to do with so damnable a compact . "
162824	162827	162693	162693	he	4829	" Damnable ! "
162828	162857	162778	162778	she	4830	" Yes ; that is what I call it . That is what any man would call it,--and any woman , too , who would speak her mind . "
162858	162900	162693	162693	he	4829	" Then , Sir , perhaps you will be kind enough to make your proposition . I have made mine , such as it is , and am sorry that it should not have been received at any rate with courtesy . "
162936	162939	162941	162941	he	4829	" Yes , "
162943	163036	162941	162941	he	4829	" You have made your proposition , and now it is only fair that I should make mine . Indeed , I made it already when I suggested that little place abroad . Let it be abroad or at home , or of what nature it may,--so that you shall be there , and I with you , it shall be enough for me . That is my proposition ; and , if it be not accepted , then I shall return to Miss Tringle and all the glories of Lombard Street . "
163037	163039	163040	163040	she	4830	" Frank-- "
163066	163069	163070	163070	she	4830	" Frank , "
163078	163113	163070	163070	she	4830	" how impossible it is that I should not be obedient to you in all things ! I know,--I know that I am agreeing to that which will cause you some day to repent . "
163114	163120	163122	163122	he	4831	" By heavens , no ! "
163124	163132	163070	163070	she	4830	" I am changed in all that . "
163133	163237	163070	163070	she	4830	" A man can not change at once . Your heart is soft , but your nature remains the same . Frank , I could be so happy at this moment if I could forget the picture which my imagination points to me of your future life . Your love , and your generous words , and the look out of your dear eyes , are sweet to me now , as when I was a child , whom you first made so proud by telling her that she owned your heart . If I could only revel in the return of your affections-- "
163238	163244	163246	163246	he	4832	" It is no return , "
163248	163265	163246	163246	he	4832	" There has never been a moment in which my affections have not been the same . "
163266	163314	163070	163070	she	4830	" Well , then,--in these permitted signs of your affection,--if it were not that I can not shut out the future ! Do not press me to name any early day , because no period of my future life will be so happy to me as this . "
163315	163326	163328	163329	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Is there any reason why I should not intrude ? "
163346	163359	163361	163361	Frank	282	" Not in the least , as far as I 'm concerned , "
163363	163387	163361	163361	Frank	282	" A few words have been spoken between us , all of which may be repeated to you if Imogene can remember them . "
163388	163394	163396	163396	Imogene	372	" Every one of them , "
163398	163409	163396	163396	Imogene	372	" but I hardly think that I shall repeat them . "
163410	163423	163425	163426	Mrs. Docimer;--"the	9285	" I suppose they have been very much a matter of course , "
163426	163453	163396	163396	Imogene	372	Docimer;--"the old story repeated between you two for the fourth or fifth time . Considering all things , do you think that I should congratulate you ? "
163454	163461	163463	163463	Imogene	372	" I ask for no congratulation , "
163465	163472	163474	163474	Frank	282	" You may certainly congratulate me , "
163547	163551	163565	163565	her	372	" The little place abroad,"--or
163793	163807	163808	163810	one club pundit	4841	" I think he must really be going to be married at last ! "
164948	164958	164962	164962	himself	282	" He always was a hard , unfeeling fellow , "
165087	165121	165122	165122	He	0	" Of course you know that nothing that he can say will make a change . I am too well satisfied to allow of any change that shall not come from you yourself . "
165199	165214	165196	165197	Mrs. Dosett	285	" As Ayala does not wish it , of course nothing can be done . "
165266	165274	165250	165251	Mrs. Dormer	284	" As Ayala does not wish it . "
165345	165354	165355	165355	he	659	" They are a pack of idiots together , "
165358	165368	165355	165355	he	659	" and Tom is the worst of the lot . "
165586	165598	165600	165601	the doctor	4889	" A little rice will be the best thing for her , "
165603	165612	165614	165615	Lady Tringle	282	" But the poor child takes nothing,--literally nothing , "
165713	165722	165723	165723	he	4889	" Your sister 's health is generally good ? "
165745	165749	165751	165752	the doctor	4889	" Eats well ? "
165774	165783	165785	165786	the doctor	4889	" She is a fine healthy young lady , "
165810	165821	165823	165824	the doctor	4889	" Now , I 'll tell you what it is , "
165826	165840	165823	165824	the doctor	4889	" Of course I do n't want to inquire into any family secrets . "
165841	165848	165850	165850	Tom	271	" My father , you know , "
165852	165864	165850	165850	Tom	271	" wo n't agree about the man she 's engaged to . "
165865	165911	165823	165824	the doctor	4889	" That is it ? I knew there was some little trouble , but I did not want to ask any questions . Your mother is unnecessarily frightened , and I have not wished to disturb her . Your sister is taking plenty of nourishment ? "
165912	165929	165850	165850	Tom	271	" She does not come to table , nor yet have it in her own room . "
165930	166034	165823	165824	the doctor	4889	" She gets it somehow . I can say that it is so . Her veins are full , and her arms are strong . Perhaps she goes into the kitchen . Have a little tray made ready for her , with something nice . She will be sure to find it , and when she has found it two or three times she will know that she has been discovered . If Lady Tringle does send for a physician from London you could perhaps find an opportunity of telling him what I have suggested . Her mamma need know nothing about it . "
166062	166073	166075	166075	Tom	271	" I took care to keep a wing for you , "
166077	166085	166075	166075	Tom	271	" I carved them myself at dinner . "
166130	166142	166112	166112	She	404	" You wo n't tell mamma , Tom , will you ? "
166206	166279	166200	166201	Lady Tringle	282	" Poor Gertrude is in a very bad state . If ever there was a girl really broken - hearted on account of love , she is one . I did not think she would ever set her heart upon a man with such violent affection . I do think you might give way when it becomes a question of life and death . There is n't anything really against Mr. Houston . "
166303	166324	166293	166293	He	271	" That men have died from time to time , and worms have eaten them , but not for love . "
167128	167131	167132	167132	she	404	" Tom , "
167135	167147	167132	167132	she	404	" that man has treated me most shamefully and most falsely . "
167148	167152	167132	167132	she	404	" What man ? "
167153	167186	167132	167132	she	404	" What man ? Why , Frank Houston . There has never been any other man . After all that has been said and done he is going to throw me over . "
167187	167194	167196	167196	Tom	271	" The governor threw him over , "
167198	167247	167196	167196	Tom	271	" That amounts to nothing . The governor would have given way , of course , and if he had n't that was no matter of his . After he had had my promise he was bound to go on with it . Do n't you think so ? "
167248	167253	167255	167255	Tom	271	" Perhaps he was , "
167259	167314	167255	167255	Tom	271	" Of course he was . What else is the meaning of a promise ? Now I 'll tell you what you must do . You must go up to London and find him out . You had better take a stick with you , and then ask him what he means to do . "
167315	167325	167196	167196	Tom	271	" And if he says he 'll do nothing ? "
167326	167378	167255	167255	Tom	271	" Then , Tom , you should call him out . It is just the position in which a brother is bound to do that kind of thing for his sister . When he has been called out , then probably he 'll come round , and all will be well . "
167486	167494	167495	167495	he	271	" That 's all nonsense , Gertrude , "
167498	167507	167495	167495	he	271	" I can do nothing of the kind . "
167508	167513	167495	167495	he	271	" You will not ? "
167514	167536	167495	167495	he	271	" Certainly not . It would be absurd . You ask Septimus and he will tell you that it is so . "
167537	167542	167495	167495	he	271	" Septimus , indeed ! "
167543	167588	167495	167495	he	271	" At any rate , I wo n't . Men do n't call each other out now - a - days . I know what ought to be done in these kind of things , and such interference as that would be altogether improper . "
167589	167594	167596	167596	she	4935	" Then , Tom , "
167609	167619	167596	167596	she	4935	" I will never call you my brother again ! "
167626	167647	167596	167596	she	4935	" Probably you are not aware , Sir , that I am not at present the young lady 's guardian . "
167823	167849	167807	167808	Sir Thomas	271	" Just so , Sir Thomas . I did hear that . But I think you were once ; and you are still her uncle . "
167850	167858	167960	167961	Sir Thomas;--"that	271	" Yes ; I am her uncle . "
167859	167948	167960	167961	Sir Thomas;--"that	271	" And when I was so ill - treated in Kingsbury Crescent I thought I would come to you . It could not be right that a gentleman making an honourable proposition,--and very liberal , as you must acknowledge,--should not be allowed to see the young lady . It was not as though I did not know her . I had been ten days in the same house with her . Do n't you think , Sir Thomas , I ought to have been allowed to see her ? "
167949	167958	167960	167961	Sir Thomas;--"that	271	" I have nothing to do with her , "
167961	167970	167960	167961	Sir Thomas;--"that	271	Thomas;--"that is , in the way of authority . "
168322	168332	168334	168335	Lady Tringle	282	" He seemed quite to have got a change , "
168337	168353	168334	168335	Lady Tringle	282	" I hope it was a change for the better as to that stupid girl . "
168390	168394	168398	168398	he	271	" brisked up , "
168438	168450	168452	168453	Sir Thomas	271	" What is he going to do when he gets there ? "
168479	168485	168487	168488	the father	757	" He is an ass , "
168490	168499	168501	168502	the mother	758	" You always say he is an ass , "
168506	168520	168501	168502	the mother	758	" No doubt I do . What else am I to call him ? "
168530	168563	168522	168522	he	757	" Let Ayala be asked to Merle Park for a week,--just for a week,--and assured that during that time Tom would not be there . Then let Captain Batsby also be invited . "
168904	168909	168899	168899	he	271	" dash at Ayala . "
168912	168914	168899	168899	he	271	" dash "
169223	169228	169229	169229	he	270	" What , Tom ! "
169232	169250	169229	169229	he	270	" I 'm glad to see you looking so well . Are you up in London again ? "
169251	169262	169264	169264	Tom	271	" I 'm in town for a day or two , "
169266	169275	169264	169264	Tom	271	" And what can I do for you ? "
169276	169306	169229	169229	he	270	" Well , Uncle Reginald , you can do a great deal for me if you will . Of course you 've heard of all those rows of mine ? "
169307	169313	169264	169264	Tom	271	" I have heard something . "
169314	169319	169321	169321	Tom	271	" Everybody has heard , "
169325	169347	169321	169321	Tom	271	" I do n't suppose anybody was ever knocked so much about as I 've been for the last six months . "
169348	169357	169264	169264	Tom	271	" I 'm sorry for that , Tom . "
169358	169387	169264	169264	Tom	271	" I 'm sure you are , because you 're always good - natured . Now I wonder if you will do a great thing to oblige me . "
169388	169396	169398	169399	Uncle Reginald	292	" Let us hear what it is , "
169401	169419	169398	169399	Uncle Reginald	292	" I suppose you know that there is only one thing in the world that I want . "
169460	169482	169443	169443	he	270	" All this about the policeman and the rest of it has simply come from my being so unhappy about Ayala . "
169483	169511	169398	169399	Uncle Reginald	292	" It would n't be taken as a promise of your being a good husband , Tom , when you get into such a mess as that . "
169512	169521	169523	169523	Tom	271	" That 's because people do n't understand , "
169525	169627	169523	169523	Tom	271	" It is because I am so earnest about it , and because I ca n't bear the disappointment ! There is n't one at Travers and Treason who does n't know that if I 'd married Ayala I should have settled down as quiet a young man as there is in all London . You ask the governor else himself . As long as I thought there was any hope I used to be there steady as a rock at half - past nine . Everybody knew it . So I should again , if she 'd only come round . "
169628	169643	169398	169399	Uncle Reginald	292	" You ca n't make a lady come round , as you call it . "
169644	169743	169523	169523	Tom	271	" Not make her ; no . Of course you ca n't make a girl . But persuading goes a long way . Why should n't she have me ? As to all these rows , she ought to feel at any rate that they 're her doing . And what she 's done it stands to reason she could undo if she would . It only wants a word from her to put me all right with the governor,--and to put me all right with Travers and Treason too . Nobody can love her as I do . "
169744	169755	169757	169758	Mr. Dosett	270	" I do believe that nobody could love her better , "
169772	169817	169757	169758	Mr. Dosett	270	" Ought n't that to go for something ? And then she would have everything that she wishes . She might live anywhere she pleased,--so that I might go to the office every day . She would have her own carriage , you know . "
169818	169830	169523	169523	Tom	271	" I do n't think that would matter much with Ayala . "
169831	169844	169846	169846	Tom	271	" It shows that I 'm in a position to ask her , "
169848	169859	169846	169846	Tom	271	" If she could only bring herself not to hate me-- "
169860	169874	169523	169523	Tom	271	" There is a difference , Tom , between hating and not loving . "
169875	169912	169523	169523	Tom	271	" If she would only begin to make a little way , then I could hope again . Uncle Reginald , could you not tell her that at any rate I would be good to her ? "
169913	169923	169924	169924	he	271	" I think you would be good to her , "
169927	169960	169924	169924	he	271	" Indeed , I would . There is nothing I would not do for her . Now will you let me see her just once again , and have one other chance ? "
170137	170170	170173	170173	she	8036	" Whether you like him or whether you do not , my dear , he is so true to you that you are bound to see him again when he asks it . "
170637	170646	170648	170649	Uncle Reginald	292	" Now I 'll look for this child , "
170748	170751	170752	170752	he	271	" Ayala , "
170760	170774	170752	170752	he	271	" Uncle Reg says that you would like to see me once again . "
170775	170804	170806	170806	he	271	" Of course I want to see you once , and twice,--and always . Ayala , if you could know it ! If you could only know it ! "
170832	170866	170806	170806	he	271	" Ayala , I feel that , if I do not have you as my own , I can only die for the want of you . Ayala , do you believe me ? "
170867	170881	170752	170752	he	271	" I suppose I believe you , but how can I help it ? "
170882	170910	170806	170806	he	271	" Try to help it ! Try to try and help it ! Say a word that you will perhaps help it by - and - bye . "
170941	170951	170752	170752	he	271	" I know you think that I am common . "
170952	170970	170752	170752	he	271	" I have never said a word , Tom , but that I could not love you . "
170971	171007	170752	170752	he	271	" But I am true,--true as the sun . Would I come again after all if it were not that I can not help coming ? You have heard that I have been,--been misbehaving myself ? "
171008	171016	170752	170752	he	271	" I have not thought about that . "
171017	171095	170752	170752	he	271	" It has been so because I have been so wretched . Ayala , you have made me so unhappy . Ayala , you can make me the happiest man there is in London this day . I seem to want nothing else . As for drink , or clubs , or billiards , and all that , they are nothing to me,--unless when I try to forget that you are so -- so unkind to me ! "
171096	171110	170752	170752	he	271	" It is not unkind , not to do as you ask me . "
171111	171134	171135	171135	She	5017	" To do as I ask you,--that would be kind . Oh , Ayala , can not you be kind to me ? "
171153	171191	171135	171135	She	5017	" May I come again ? Will you give me three months , and then think of it ? If you would only say that , I would go back to my work and never leave it . "
171199	171205	171193	171193	she	5017	" Must I never hope ? "
171206	171219	171273	171273	her	5017	" Not for that , Tom . How can I help it ? "
171220	171225	171273	171273	her	5017	" Not help it . "
171226	171248	171193	171193	she	5017	" No . How can I help it ? One does not fall in love by trying,--nor by trying prevent it . "
171249	171258	171259	171259	She	5017	" By degrees you might love me,--a little . "
171276	171283	171284	171284	he	5018	" It is that accursed Colonel , "
171296	171302	171304	171304	Ayala	287	" He is not accursed , "
171308	171314	171304	171304	Ayala	287	" Then you love him ? "
171315	171336	171273	171273	her	5017	" No ! But you should not ask . You have no right to ask . It is not proper . "
171337	171345	171304	171304	Ayala	287	" You are not engaged to him ? "
171346	171411	171304	171304	Ayala	287	" No ; I am not engaged to him . I do not love him . As you will ask , I tell you . But you should not ask ; and he is not accursed . He is better than you,--though I do not love him . You should not have driven me to say this . I do not ask you questions . "
171412	171426	171273	171273	her	5017	" There is none that I would not answer . Stay , Ayala , "
171437	171473	171429	171429	she	5020	" Stay yet a moment . Do you know that you are tearing my heart in pieces ? Why is it that you should make me so wretched ? Dear Ayala;--dearest Ayala;--stay yet a moment . "
171474	171533	171534	171534	Tom	271	" Tom , there is nothing more that I can say . I am very , very sorry if you are unhappy . I do think that you are good and true ; and if you will shake hands with me , there is my hand . But I can not say what you want me to say . "
171949	171952	171953	171953	he	3313	" Tom , "
171956	171965	171953	171953	he	3313	" you 'll stay and eat your dinner ? "
171966	171971	171973	171973	Tom	271	" No , indeed , "

173705	173710	173665	173665	himself	271	spirit,--"and my dinner too . "
173711	173734	173752	173752	he	271	" No dinner , Mr. Tringle ; and you wet through like that ! What shall I get you , Mr. Tringle ? "
173817	173835	173811	173811	he	325	" Better have a mutton chop and a little drop of brandy - and - water hot . "
173836	173846	173848	173850	the young man	1162	" I ai n't up to it , Bolivia , "
173852	173874	173848	173850	the young man	1162	" I could n't swallow it if I had it . Give us the bottle of champagne and the devilled biscuit . "
174012	174021	174023	174029	the keeper of the eating - house	5114	" If I were you , Mr. Tringle , "
174031	174046	174023	174029	the keeper of the eating - house	5114	" I 'd go home at once , because you are so mortal wet . "
174047	174051	174053	174053	Tom	271	" All right , "
174580	174604	174605	174605	he	271	" And she might be as good as the best of them , and I might be here to hand her into her own carriage,"--said
174607	174615	174619	174620	the intruder	5135	himself,--"if it were not for that intruder ! "
174688	174697	174699	174701	the elder lady	5141	" You will be down by the twentieth ? "
174703	174710	174712	174713	the Colonel	2361	" Punctual as the day comes , "
174715	174724	174726	174727	the younger	733	" And mind you have Ayala with you , "
174729	174747	174749	174750	the Colonel	2361	" If Lady Albury can manage it with her aunt of course I will wait upon her , "
174985	174988	174990	174990	he	2361	" There , "
174992	175008	174990	174990	he	2361	" there ! You would not fight me , and now you have got it . "
175068	175078	175080	175081	the policeman	3957	" We 've got him , Sir;--we've got him , "
175083	175089	175091	175091	Tom	271	" You 've got me , "
175093	175101	175091	175091	Tom	271	" but I 've had my revenge . "
175132	175148	175152	175153	the policemen	5171	" It 's the chap who gave that hawful blow to Thompson in the bow'ls ! "
175178	175183	175185	175186	the Colonel	2361	" I know him , "
175191	175200	175185	175186	the Colonel	2361	" It is a matter of no consequence . "
175201	175215	175252	175253	The policeman	3957	" So do we , Sir . He 's Thomas Tringle , junior . "
175216	175224	175226	175227	the Colonel	2361	" He 's a friend of mine , "
175229	175238	175226	175227	the Colonel	2361	" You must let him come with me . "
175239	175246	175248	175250	an amateur attendant	5176	" A friend , is he ? "
175279	175287	175289	175290	the amateur	5179	" A very hugly sort of friend , "
175303	175306	175308	175309	the Colonel	2361	" Tringle , "
175311	175337	175308	175309	the Colonel	2361	" this was very foolish , you know,--a most absurd thing to do ! Come with me , and we will talk it all over . "
175338	175354	175356	175357	the policeman	3957	" He must come along with us to the watch - house just at present , "
175359	175399	175356	175357	the policeman	3957	" And you , Sir , if you can , had better please to come with us . It ai n't far across to Vine Street , but of course you can have a cab if you like it . "
175565	175569	175570	175570	he	2361	" No doubt , "
175573	175593	175570	175570	he	2361	" he had received a blow on his chest , but it had not hurt him in the least . "
175594	175608	175610	175611	the policeman	3957	" ' E ' it the gen'leman with all his might and main , "
175613	175621	175623	175624	the Colonel	2361	" It is quite a private affair , "
175626	175647	175623	175624	the Colonel	2361	" My name is Colonel Stubbs ; here is my card . Sir ---- is a particular friend of mine . "
175666	175701	175703	175703	he	2361	" If you will let the gentleman come away with me I will be responsible for him to - morrow , if it should be necessary to take any further step in the matter . "
175920	175930	175932	175933	the Colonel	2361	" In heaven 's name , my dear fellow , "
175935	175970	175932	175933	the Colonel	2361	" what good do you expect to get by that ? You have hit me a blow when you knew that I was unprepared , and , therefore , unarmed . Was that manly ? "
175978	175986	175973	175973	Tom	271	" I suppose you have been drinking ? "
176003	176020	175987	175988	And Stubbs	385	" I see you have been drinking . What a fool you are making of yourself ! "
176021	176027	176029	176029	Tom	271	" It is that girl , "
176031	176083	176029	176029	Tom	271	" Does that seem to you to be right ? Can you do yourself any good by that ? Will she be more likely to listen to you when she hears that you have got drunk , and have assaulted me in the street ? Have I done you any harm ? "
176084	176094	176096	176096	Tom	271	" She says that you are better than me , "
176098	176224	176096	176096	Tom	271	" If she does , is that my doing ? Come , old fellow , try to be a man . Try to think of this thing rightly . If you can win the girl you love , win her ; but , if you can not , do not be such an ass as to suppose that she is to love no one because she will not love you . It is a thing which a man must bear if it comes in his way . As far as Miss Dormer is concerned , I am in the same condition as you . But do you think that I should attack you in the street if she began to favour you to - morrow ? "
176225	176241	176314	176315	the Colonel	2361	" I wish she would ; and then I should n't care what you did . "
176242	176300	176302	176302	Tom	271	" I should think you a happy fellow , certainly ; and for a time I might avoid you , because your happiness would remind me of my own disappointment ; but I should not come behind your back and strike you ! Now , tell me where you live , and I will see you home . "
176756	176759	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" Yes , "
176773	176793	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" It was me . I struck Colonel Stubbs , and he got me off at the police office . "
176794	176805	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" And you 're proud of what you 've done ? "
176806	176835	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" No , Sir , I 'm not . I 'm not proud of anything . Whatever I do or whatever I say seems to go against me . "
176836	176848	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" He did n't go against you as you call it . "
176849	176893	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" I wish he had with all my heart . I did n't ask him to get me off . I struck him because I hated him ; and whatever might have happened I would sooner have borne it than be like this . "
176894	176906	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" You would sooner have been locked up again in prison ? "
176907	176918	176761	176761	Tom,--who	539	" I would sooner anything than be as I am . "
176919	176929	176931	176932	the father	757	" I tell you what it is , Tom , "
176934	176974	176931	176932	the father	757	" If you remain here any longer with this bee in your bonnet you will be locked up in a lunatic asylum , and I shall not be able to get you out again . You must go abroad . "
177049	177056	177058	177059	the father	757	" Do you think it well , "
177061	177079	177058	177059	the father	757	" that you should remain in London while such paragraphs as these are being written about you ? "
177080	177088	177090	177090	Tom	271	" I am not in London now , "
177092	177125	177058	177059	the father	757	" No , you are not in London while you are at Merle Park,--of course . And you will not go up to London without my leave . Do you understand that ? "
177132	177137	177139	177140	his father	1095	" If you do , "
177142	177200	177139	177140	his father	1095	" you shall not be received down here again , nor at Queen 's Gate , nor will the cheques for your allowance be honoured any longer at the bank . In fact if you do not obey me I will throw you off altogether . This absurdity about your love has been carried on long enough . "
178344	178358	178359	178359	she	285	" I do think it was so noble not to hit Tom again , "
178503	178516	178517	178518	Sir Thomas	271	" If Ayala comes to us she will want a few things , "
178620	178628	178629	178630	Mrs. Dosett	285	" We will both go to work , "
178633	178647	178629	178630	Mrs. Dosett	285	" and we will ask your uncle what he can do for us . "
178683	178686	178688	178688	she	287	Stalham,--"dear Stalham , "
179514	179526	179527	179528	her aunt	737	" Your uncle thinks it is right that you should go , "
179540	179562	179527	179528	her aunt	737	" and we will set to work to - morrow and do the best that we can to make you smart . "
179595	179610	179611	179611	she	287	" I am so sorry to cost you so much money , Uncle Reginald , "
179614	179625	179626	179626	he	734	" It will not be very much , my dear , "
179629	179653	179611	179611	she	287	" It is hard that young people should not have some amusement . I only hope they will make you happy at Stalham . "
179654	179663	179665	179665	Ayala	287	" They always make people happy at Stalham , "
179669	179675	179677	179678	her aunt	737	" And now , Ayala , "
179680	179716	179677	179678	her aunt	737	" you can write your letter to Lady Albury before we go out to - morrow . Give her my compliments , and tell her that as you are writing I need not trouble her . "
180366	180371	180376	180376	herself	413	" Foolish little child , "
180378	180387	180373	180374	Lady Albury	413	" As if that would make any difference ! "
180554	180559	180552	180552	herself	413	often,--"her own real brother . "
181019	181032	181034	181035	Lady Albury	542	" The stupid little wretch will throw you out , I know , "
181037	181078	181034	181035	Lady Albury	542	" by making you start two hours before you have done your work . But you must let your work do itself for this occasion . There is nothing like a little journey together to make people understand each other . "
181280	181303	181307	181307	he	2361	" If I can not persuade her at last , I shall be knocking somebody over the head , as he did . "
181326	181332	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" And now , Jonathan , "
181337	181353	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" what can there possibly be to justify you in giving me all this trouble ? "
181354	181368	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" You know you had to come up about that cook 's character . "
181369	181405	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" I know that I have given that as a reason to Sir Harry ; but I know also that I should have gone without a cook for a twelvemonth had you not summoned me . "
181406	181446	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" The truth is I could not get down to Stalham and back without losing an additional day , which I can not possibly spare . With you it does not very much matter how many days you spare . "
181447	181489	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" Nor how much money I spend , nor how much labour I take , so that I obey all the commands of Colonel Jonathan Stubbs ! What on earth is there that I can say or do for you more ? "
181490	181498	181500	181500	he	5412	" There are one or two things , "
181502	181523	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" that I want you to understand . In the first place , I am quite in earnest about this . "
181524	181535	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" Do n't I know that you 're in earnest ? "
181536	181562	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" But perhaps you do not understand the full extent of my earnestness . If she were to refuse me ultimately I should go away . "
181563	181570	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" Go away ! Go where ? "
181571	181604	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" Oh ; that I have not at all thought of;--probably to India , as I might manage to get a regiment there . But in truth it would matter very little . "
181605	181613	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" You are talking like a goose . "
181614	181684	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" That is very likely , because in this matter I think and feel like a goose . It is not a great thing in a man to be turned out of his course by some undefined feeling which he has as to a young woman . But the thing has occurred before now , and will occur again , in my case , if I am thrown over . "
181685	181695	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" What on earth is there about the girl ? "
181700	181747	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" There is that precious brother - in - law of ours going to hang himself incontinently because she will not look at him . And that unfortunate friend of yours , Tom Tringle , is , if possible , worse than Ben Batsby or yourself . "
181748	181781	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" If two other gentlemen are in the same condition it only makes it the less singular that I should be the third . At any rate , I am the third . "
181782	181793	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" You do not mean to liken yourself to them ? "
181794	181850	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" Indeed I do . As to our connection with Miss Dormer , I can see no difference . We are all in love with her , and she has refused us all . It matters little whether a man 's ugliness or his rings or his natural stupidity may have brought about this result . "
181851	181859	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" You are very modest , Jonathan . "
181860	181963	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" I always was , only you never could see it . I am modest in this matter ; but not for that reason the less persistent in doing the best I can for myself . My object now in seeing you is to let you understand that it is -- well , not life and death , because she will not suffice either to kill me or to keep me alive,--but one of those matters which , in a man 's career , are almost as important to him as life and death . She was very decided in her refusal . "
181964	182001	181697	181698	Lady Albury	542	" So is every girl when a first offer is made to her . How is any girl so to arrange her thoughts at a moment 's notice as to accept a man off - hand ? "
182002	182008	181334	181335	Lady Albury	542	" Girls do do so . "
182009	182026	182028	182029	Lady Albury	542	" Very rarely , I think ; and when they do they are hardly worth having , "
182042	182118	182028	182029	Lady Albury	542	" If a girl accept a man all at once when she has had , as it were , no preparation for such a proposal , she must always surely be in a state of great readiness for matrimonial projects . When there has been a prolonged period of spooning then of course it is quite a different thing . The whole thing has in fact been arranged before the important word has been spoken . "
182119	182129	182131	182131	he	542	" What a professor in the art you are ! "
182133	182240	182131	182131	he	542	" The odd thing is , that such a one as you should be so ignorant . Ca n't you understand that she would not come to Stalham if her mind were made up against you ? I said nothing of you as a lover , but I took care to let her know that you were coming . You are very ready to put yourself in the same boat with poor Ben Batsby or that other unfortunate wretch . Would she , do you think , have consented to come had she known that Ben would have been there , or your friend Tom Tringle ? "
182278	182287	182288	182288	she	287	" Of course I will do my best , "
182297	182321	182288	182288	she	287	" Though I am not quite as much in love with her myself as you are , yet I will do my best . "
182740	182747	182749	182749	Ayala	287	" My aunt , Mrs. Dosett , "
183106	183125	183127	183128	the Colonel	2361	" I do n't think she will be let to come away at the end of a week , "
183130	183143	183127	183128	the Colonel	2361	" Sir Harry does n't like people to come away very soon . "
183170	183182	183184	183185	the Colonel	2361	" They go up to London about the end of March , "
183187	183205	183184	183185	the Colonel	2361	" and if Miss Dormer were to return about a week before it would do very well . "
183206	183211	183213	183213	Ayala	287	" Oh , no , "
183223	183235	183213	183213	Ayala	287	" I could n't think of staying so long as that . "
183323	183335	183337	183339	the old gentleman	860	" If you do n't mind shutting the door , Sir , "
183344	183355	183337	183339	the old gentleman	860	" because my wife has a pain in her face . "
183392	183415	183387	183389	the old lady	5464	" If you do n't mind shutting that hole up there , Sir , because my husband is very bad with neuralgia . "
183441	183449	183451	183453	the old gentleman	860	" There are draughts come in everywhere , "
183455	183463	183451	183453	the old gentleman	860	" The Company ought to be prosecuted . "
183464	183478	183480	183482	the old lady	5464	" I believe the more people they kill the better they like it , "
183543	183553	183555	183556	the Colonel	2361	" The weather has been very severe all day , "
183575	183589	183591	183593	the old lady	5464	" Then , Miss , I think you must be made of granite , "
183595	183609	183591	183593	the old lady	5464	" I hope you 'll remember that other people are not so fortunate . "
183665	183676	183678	183678	he	2361	" What an ill - natured girl you must be , "
183680	183696	183678	183678	he	2361	" to have put me to such a terrible amount of trouble all on purpose . "
183697	183702	183704	183704	Ayala	287	" I did n't , "
183706	183770	183704	183704	Ayala	287	" Yes , you did . Why would n't you come down by the four o'clock train as I told you ? Now I 've left everything undone , and I should n't wonder if I get into such a row at the Horse Guards that I shall never hear the end of it . And now you are not a bit grateful . "
183771	183789	183790	183790	she	287	" Yes , I am grateful ; but I did n't want you to come at all , "
183793	183809	183790	183790	she	287	" Of course I should come . I did n't think you were so perverse . "
183810	183819	183704	183704	Ayala	287	" I 'm not perverse , Colonel Stubbs . "
183820	183838	183840	183842	the old lady	5464	" When young persons are perverse , it is my opinion they ought n't to be encouraged , "
183847	183857	183859	183861	the old gentleman	860	" My dear , you know nothing about it , "
183863	183869	183871	183873	the old lady	5464	" Yes , I do , "
183875	183921	183871	183873	the old lady	5464	" I know all about it . Whatever she does a young lady ought not to be perverse . I do hate perversity . I am sure that hole up there must be open , Sir , for the wind does come in so powerful . "
184136	184145	184146	184146	he	7484	" I do abominate a perverse young woman , "
184229	184239	184240	184240	he	2361	" They never have their own bread to earn , "
184243	184260	184240	184240	he	2361	" and they ought to make themselves agreeable to other people who have more to do . "
184261	184270	184272	184274	the old lady	5464	" I quite agree with you , Sir , "
184276	184302	184272	184274	the old lady	5464	" They should run about and be handy . I like to see a girl that can jump about the house and make herself useful . "
184303	184312	184314	184316	the old man	7954	" Young ladies ought to be young ladies , "
184330	184346	184348	184349	the Colonel	2361	" And ca n't a young lady be useful and yet be a young lady ? "
184351	184361	184363	184365	the old gentleman	860	" It is her special province to be ornamental , "
184367	184395	184363	184365	the old gentleman	860	" I like to see young ladies ornamental . I do n't think young ladies ought to be scolded , even if they are a little fractious . "
184396	184405	184407	184407	Ayala	287	" I quite agree with you , Sir , "
184481	184497	184499	184499	Ayala	287	" How could you be so wicked as to go on hoaxing her like that ? "
184510	184554	184499	184499	Ayala	287	" There was no hoax at all . I was quite in earnest . Was not every word true that I said ? Now come and get into the carriage quickly , or you will be as bad as the old gentleman himself . "
184905	184926	184928	184929	Sir Harry	415	" Why the deuce do n't you let the two men come , and then the best man may win ! "
184994	185003	185004	185004	he	3130	" Who the deuce is this little girl , "
185007	185020	185004	185004	he	3130	" that everybody should be knocked about in this way for her ? "
185196	185205	185190	185190	he	290	" It was all Sir Thomas 's doing . "
185296	185299	185293	185293	he	627	" done . "
185480	185504	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Well , you know , Captain Batsby , to tell you the truth , we are not very fond of our cousin . "
185505	185516	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Sir Thomas told me she was to be here . "
185517	185532	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" So we know . My father is perhaps a little mistaken about Ayala . "
185533	185539	185541	185542	Captain Batsby	290	" Was she not asked ? "
185553	185602	185541	185542	Captain Batsby	290	" Oh , yes ; she was asked . She has been asked very often , because she is mamma 's niece , and did live with us once for a short time . But she did not come . In fact she wo n't go anywhere , unless-- "
185603	185607	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Unless what ? "
185608	185614	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" You know Colonel Stubbs ? "
185615	185651	185541	185542	Captain Batsby	290	" Jonathan Stubbs . Oh dear , yes ; very intimately . He is a sort of connection of mine . He is my half - brother 's second cousin by the father 's side . "
185652	185663	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Oh indeed ! Does that make him very near ? "
185664	185690	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Not at all . I do n't like him , if you mean that . He always takes everything upon himself down at Stalham . "
185691	185704	185541	185542	Captain Batsby	290	" What we hear is that Ayala is always running after him . "
185705	185711	185474	185475	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Ayala running after Jonathan ? "
185712	185720	185722	185723	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Have n't you heard of that ? "
185725	185762	185722	185723	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Why;--she is at Stalham with the Alburys this moment , and I do not doubt that Colonel Stubbs is there also . She would not have gone had she not been sure of meeting him . "
186232	186234	186228	186228	he	385	" cheek "
186297	186304	186266	186266	he	385	" Is he very much provoked ? "
186313	186318	186266	186266	he	385	" Provoked about what ? "
186319	186331	186285	186285	Ayala	287	" He was expressly told that he would meet Ayala here . "
186332	186368	186266	186266	he	385	" He seems to be making himself very comfortable , and has n't said a word to me about Ayala . I am sick of Ayala . Poor Tom is going to be really ill . "
186521	186537	186539	186539	Tom	271	" I believe you were acquainted with my cousin , Miss Dormer , at Stalham ? "
186573	186578	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" Oh , yes , "
186588	186597	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" I saw a good deal of her . "
186598	186603	186605	186605	Tom	271	" A wonderful creature ! "
186607	186612	186605	186605	Tom	271	" Yes , indeed ! "
186613	186638	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" For a real romantic style of beauty , I do n't suppose that the world ever saw her like before . Did you ? "
186639	186649	186651	186652	the Captain	3130	" Are you one among your cousin 's admirers ? "
186654	186658	186660	186660	Tom	271	" Am I ? "
186678	186697	186660	186660	Tom	271	" Am I one of her admirers ? Why,--rather ! Have n't you heard about me and Stubbs ? "
186698	186703	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" No , indeed . "
186704	186720	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" I thought that everybody had heard that . I challenged him , you know . "
186721	186727	186660	186660	Tom	271	" To fight a duel ? "
186728	186775	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" Yes ; to fight a duel . I sent my friend Faddle down with a letter to Stalham , but it was of no use . Why should a man fight a duel when he has got such a girl as Ayala to love him ? "
186776	186784	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" That is quite true , then ? "
186785	186805	186807	186807	he	5564	" I fear so ! I fear so ! Oh , yes ; it is too true . Then you know;"--and
186823	186842	186815	186815	he	5564	fiercely;--"then , you know , I met him under the portico of the Haymarket , and struck him . "
186843	186848	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" Oh,--was that you ? "
186849	186854	186580	186581	Captain Batsby	290	" Indeed it was . "
186855	186865	186815	186815	he	5564	" And he did not do anything to you ? "
186866	186873	186875	186875	Tom	271	" He behaved like a hero , "
186877	186893	186875	186875	Tom	271	" I do think that he behaved like a hero,--though of course I hate him . "
186903	187052	186875	186875	Tom	271	" He would n't let them lock me up . Though , in the matter of that , I should have been best pleased if they would have locked me up for ever , and kept me from the sight of the world . Admire that girl , Captain Batsby ! I do n't think that I ever heard of a man who loved a girl as I love her . I do not hesitate to say that I continue to walk the world,--in the way of not committing suicide , I mean,--simply because there is still a possibility while she has not as yet stood at the hymeneal altar with another man . I would have shot Stubbs willingly , though I knew I was to be tried for it at the Old Bailey,--and hung ! I would have done it willingly,--willingly ; or any other man . "
187341	187352	187354	187354	Augusta	302	" You are well rid of him , I think , "
187384	187408	187362	187362	She	404	" After all , a man with nothing to do in the world , with no profession , no occupation , with no money-- "
187409	187422	187354	187354	Augusta	302	" Mr. Traffick had not got very much money of his own . "
187423	187468	187505	187507	the married sister	5580	" He has a seat in Parliament , which is very much more than fortune , and will undoubtedly be in power when his party comes in . And he is a man of birth . But Frank Houston had nothing to recommend him . "
187469	187472	187474	187474	Gertrude	404	" Birth ! "
187481	187503	187474	187474	Gertrude	404	" The Queen , who is the fountain of honour , made his father a nobleman , and that constitutes birth . "
187526	187538	187540	187540	Gertrude	404	" I do n't know that we need talk about it , "
187542	187602	187540	187540	Gertrude	404	" Not at all . Mr. Houston has behaved very badly , and I suppose there is an end of him as far as this house is concerned . Captain Batsby seems to me to be a very nice young man , and I suppose he has got money . A man should certainly have got money,--or an occupation . "
187603	187609	187611	187611	Gertrude	404	" He has got both , "
187635	187644	187645	187645	Gertrude	404	" Have you forgotten my cousin so soon ? "
187676	187688	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" Do you throw that in my teeth as an offence ? "
187689	187700	187702	187702	Gertrude	404	" Inconstancy in men is generally considered as an offence , "
187717	187747	187702	187702	Gertrude	404	" After all I have heard of your cousin since I have been here , I should hardly have thought that it would be reckoned so in this case . "
187748	187758	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" You have heard nothing against her from me . "
187759	187772	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" I am told that she has treated your brother very badly . "
187773	187777	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" Poor Tom ! "
187778	187791	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" And that she is flirting with a man I particularly dislike . "
187792	187806	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" I suppose she does make herself rather peculiar with that Colonel Stubbs . "
187807	187826	187662	187663	The Captain	3130	" And , after all , only think how little I saw of her ! She is pretty . "
187827	187839	187841	187841	Gertrude	404	" So some people think . I never saw it myself , "
187843	187912	187841	187841	Gertrude	404	" We always thought her a mass of affectation . We had to turn her out of the house once you know . She was living here , and then it was that her sister had to come in her place . It is not their fault that they have got nothing;--poor girls ! They are mamma 's nieces , and so papa always has one of them . "
188156	188172	188174	188175	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Let him go to papa in the usual way , and ask his leave , "
188177	188183	188185	188185	Gertrude	404	" I did suggest that , "
188187	188200	188185	188185	Gertrude	404	" but he seems not to like to do it quite yet . "
188201	188210	188174	188175	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Is he such a coward as that ? "
188211	188254	188174	188175	Mrs. Traffick	330	" I do not know that he is more a coward than anybody else . I remember when Septimus was quite afraid to go near papa . But then Benjamin has got money of his own , which does make a difference . "
188255	188296	188185	188185	Gertrude	404	" It 's quite untrue saying that Septimus was ever afraid of papa . Of course he knows his position as a Member of Parliament too well for that . I suppose the truth is , it 's about Ayala . "
188297	188306	188308	188308	Gertrude	404	" It is a little odd about Ayala , "
188315	188352	188308	188308	Gertrude	404	" It is so hard to make papa understand about these kind of things . I declare I believe he thinks that I never ought to speak to another man because of that scoundrel Frank Houston . "
188461	188472	188473	188473	he	290	" What on earth is that man staying here for ? "
188479	188487	188473	188473	he	290	" I think he likes the place . "
188488	188507	188473	188473	he	290	" Perhaps he likes the place as well as Septimus Traffick , and means to live here always ! "
188530	188539	188541	188542	Sir Thomas	271	" When does he mean to go away ? "
188587	188590	188592	188592	she	282	" Perhaps , "
188594	188606	188592	188592	she	282	" he is becoming fond of some of the young ladies . "
188607	188620	188628	188629	Lady Tringle	282	" Young ladies ! What young ladies ? Do you mean Lucy ? "
188621	188626	188628	188629	Lady Tringle	282	" Oh dear no ! "
188631	188715	188628	188629	Lady Tringle	282	" Then what the deuce do you mean ? He came here after Ayala , because I wanted to have all that nonsense settled about Tom . Ayala is not here , nor likely to be here ; and I do n't know why he should stay here philandering away his time . I hate men in a country - house who are thorough idlers . You had better take an opportunity of letting him know that he has been here long enough . "
188767	188780	188785	188785	Gertrude	404	" No doubt it will be very hard to make papa understand . "
188927	188942	188923	188923	Augusta	302	" something must be done , either with papa 's consent or without it . "
188957	188970	188951	188951	Gertrude	404	" Papa , too probably , would not consent quite at once . "
188971	188984	188986	188987	the Captain	3130	" He must think it very odd that I am staying here , "
188989	189007	188986	188987	the Captain	3130	" Of course it is odd . If you could go to him and tell him everything ! "
189094	189109	189111	189112	the Captain	3130	" If Sir Thomas were made really angry , the consequences would be disastrous , "
189167	189175	189177	189177	Gertrude	404	" If you mean about the money , "
189179	189191	189177	189177	Gertrude	404	" I am quite sure that it would all come right . "
189230	189241	189243	189243	Gertrude	404	" Papa was never unkind about money in his life , "
189245	189257	189243	189243	Gertrude	404	" He could not endure to have any of us poor . "
189565	189576	189577	189577	he	271	" What on earth is that man staying here for ? "
189583	189590	189592	189593	Lady Tringle	282	" He is going on Friday , "
189660	189669	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" She sails on the nineteenth of April , "
189677	189692	189694	189694	Tom	271	" I do n't think I could go as soon as that , Sir , "
189698	189729	189694	189694	Tom	271	" Why not ? There are more than three weeks yet , and your mother will have everything ready for you . What on earth is there to hinder you ? "
189730	189746	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" I do n't think I could go -- not on the nineteenth of April . "
189747	189803	189694	189694	Tom	271	" Well then , you must . I have taken your place , and Firkin expects you at New York . They 'll do everything for you there , and you 'll find quite a new life . I should have thought you 'd have been delighted to get away from your wretched condition here . "
189804	189809	189811	189811	Tom	271	" It is wretched , "
189813	189824	189811	189811	Tom	271	" but I 'd rather not go quite so soon . "
189825	189829	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" Why not ? "
189830	189834	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" Well , then-- "
189835	189854	189811	189811	Tom	271	" What is it , Tom ? It makes me unhappy when I see you such a fool . "
189855	189868	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" I am a fool ! I know I am a fool ! "
189869	189897	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" Then make a new start of it . Cut and run , and begin the world again . You 're young enough to forget all this . "
189898	189904	189811	189811	Tom	271	" So I would , only-- "
189905	189909	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" Only what ? "
189910	189971	189671	189672	Sir Thomas	271	" I suppose she is engaged to that man Stubbs ! If I knew it for certain then I would go . If I went before , I should only come back as soon as I got to New York . If they were once married and it were all done with I think I could make a new start . "
190067	190079	190081	190082	Sir Thomas	271	" You 'll have to learn that I 'm in earnest , "
190341	190350	190352	190352	Augusta	302	" They have gone to Ostend , mamma , "
190354	190388	190352	190352	Augusta	302	" I was sure of it , because I 've heard Gertrude say that people can always get themselves married at Ostend . There is a clergyman there on purpose to do it . "
191024	191027	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" Idiots ! "
191032	191053	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" What on earth can they have gone to Ostend for ? And what can you do by coming up ? "
191054	191066	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" My mother thought that I might follow them to Ostend . "
191067	191125	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" They would n't care for you . No one will care for you until you have got rid of all this folly . I must go . Idiots ! Who is to marry them at Ostend ? If they are fools enough to want to be married , why should n't they get married in England ? "
191126	191136	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" I suppose they thought you would n't consent . "
191137	191178	191029	191030	Sir Thomas	271	" Of course I sha n't consent . But why should I consent a bit more because they have gone to Ostend ? I do n't suppose anybody ever had such a set of fools about him as I have . "
191434	191448	191450	191451	Sir Thomas	271	" What on earth , Sir , is the meaning of all this ? "
191474	191493	191450	191451	Sir Thomas	271	" I have just run away with your daughter , Sir Thomas . That is the simple truth . "
191494	191507	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" And I have got the trouble of taking her back again . "
191508	191522	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" I have behaved like a gentleman through it all , Sir Thomas , "
191537	191603	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" You have behaved like a fool . What on earth am I to think of it , Sir ? You were asked down to my house because you gave me to understand that you proposed to ask my niece , Miss Dormer , to be your wife ; and now you have run away with my daughter . Is that behaviour like a gentleman ? "
191604	191610	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" I must explain myself ? "
191611	191616	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" Well , Sir ? "
191633	191652	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" Do you mean to say that it was a lie from beginning to end about Miss Dormer ? "
191676	191698	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" Oh dear no . What I said then was quite true . It was my intention . But -- but-- . "
191722	191751	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" There was no lie,--no lie at all . I beg to assure you , Sir Thomas , that I am not a man to tell a lie . "
191752	191761	191792	191794	the angry father	5678	" How has it all been , then ? "
191762	191775	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" When I found how very superior a person your daughter was ! "
191776	191790	191792	191794	the angry father	5678	" It is n't a month since she was engaged to somebody else , "
191803	191806	191808	191809	Captain Batsby	290	" Gertrude ? "
191811	191824	191808	191809	Captain Batsby	290	" You are two fools . So you gave up my niece ? "
191825	191859	191524	191525	the Captain	3130	" Oh dear yes , altogether . She did n't come to Merle Park , you know . How was I to say anything to her when you did n't have her there ? "
191860	191892	191808	191809	Captain Batsby	290	" Why did n't you go away then , instead of remaining under a false pretence ? Or why , at any rate , did n't you tell me the truth ? "
191893	191904	191906	191907	Captain Batsby	290	" And what would you have me to do now ? "
191909	191915	191921	191921	he	271	" Go to the d---- , "
191980	191985	191986	191986	she	404	" Oh , papa , "
191995	192003	191986	191986	she	404	" you do mean to forgive us ? "
192004	192026	191973	191974	her father	627	" I mean to do nothing of the kind . I mean to carry you home and have you locked up . "
192027	192034	191973	191974	her father	627	" But we may be married ! "
192035	192063	191986	191986	she	404	" Not with my leave . Why did n't you come and ask if you wanted to get yourselves married ? Why did n't you tell me ? "
192064	192069	191973	191974	her father	627	" We were ashamed . "
192070	192084	191973	191974	her father	627	" What has become of Mr. Houston , whom you loved so dearly ? "
192085	192090	191973	191974	her father	627	" Oh , papa ! "
192091	192102	191973	191974	her father	627	" And the Captain was so much attached to Ayala ! "
192103	192108	191973	191974	her father	627	" Oh , papa ! "
192109	192146	191973	191974	her father	627	" Get up , you stupid girl . Why is it that my children are so much more foolish than other people 's ? I do n't suppose you care for the man in the least . "
192147	192162	191973	191974	her father	627	" I do , I do . I love him with all my heart . "
192163	192188	191973	191974	her father	627	" And as for him,--how can he care for you when it is but the other day he was in love with your cousin ? "
192189	192194	191973	191974	her father	627	" Oh , papa ! "
192195	192206	191973	191974	her father	627	" What he wants is my money , of course . "
192207	192217	191973	191974	her father	627	" He has got plenty of money , papa . "
192218	192291	191973	191974	her father	627	" I can understand him , fool as he is . There is something for him to get . He wo n't get it , but he might think it possible . As for you , I can not understand you at all . What do you expect ? It ca n't be for love of a hatchet - faced fellow like that , whom you had never seen a fortnight ago . "
192292	192303	191973	191974	her father	627	" It is more than a month ago , papa . "
192304	192319	191973	191974	her father	627	" Frank Houston was , at any rate , a manly - looking fellow . "
192320	192326	192328	192328	Gertrude	404	" He was a scoundrel , "
192338	192357	192359	192360	the father	757	" A good - looking fellow was Frank Houston ; that at least may be said for him , "
192371	192417	192418	192418	he	757	" I had half a mind to give way about him , because he was a manly , outspoken fellow , though he was such an idle dog . If you 'd gone off with him , I could have understood it;--and perhaps forgiven it , "
192421	192427	192429	192429	Gertrude	404	" He was a scoundrel ! "
192445	192464	192432	192432	her	404	" But this fellow ! I can not bring myself to believe that you really care for him . "
192465	192484	192418	192418	he	757	" He has a good income of his own , while Houston was little better than a beggar . "
192485	192492	192494	192495	Sir Thomas	271	" I 'm glad of that , "
192497	192565	192494	192495	Sir Thomas	271	" because there will be something for you to live upon . I can assure you that Captain Batsby will never get a shilling of my money . Now , you had better finish dressing yourself , and come down and eat your dinner with me if you 've got any appetite . You will have to go back to Dover by the boat to - night . "
192566	192573	192575	192575	Gertrude	404	" May Ben dine with us ? "
192579	192600	192602	192603	Sir Thomas	271	" Ben may go to the d---- . At any rate he had better not show himself to me again , "
192689	192699	192700	192700	she	7539	" You will come to me again , Ben , "
192710	192726	192705	192705	he	290	" You do not mean to say that after all this you will desert me ? "
192727	192735	192791	192791	He	290	" He has insulted me so horribly ! "
192736	192759	192705	192705	he	290	" What does that signify ? Of course he is angry . If you could only hear how he has insulted me . "
192760	192776	192705	192705	he	290	" He says that you were in love with somebody else not a month since . "
192777	192790	192791	192791	He	290	" So were you , Ben , for the matter of that . "
193247	193257	193259	193259	Ayala	287	" He has behaved so badly , Lady Albury , "
193261	193264	193266	193267	Sir Harry	415	" What;--Stubbs ? "
193281	193308	193266	193267	Sir Harry	415	" Yes , Sir Harry . There was an old lady and an old gentleman . They were very funny and he would laugh at them . "
193309	193314	193316	193317	the Colonel	2361	" I deny it , "
193319	193332	193316	193317	the Colonel	2361	" Why should n't he laugh at them if they were funny ? "
193337	193378	193334	193335	Lady Albury	542	" He knew it would make me laugh out loud . I could n't help myself , but he could be as grave as a judge all the time . So he went till the old woman scolded me dreadfully . "
193379	193388	193390	193391	the Colonel	2361	" But the old man took your part , "
193393	193404	193390	193391	the Colonel	2361	" Yes;--he did . He said that I was ornamental . "
193405	193415	193419	193424	the sportsmen in top - boots	5723	" A decent and truth - speaking old gentleman , "
193426	193466	193419	193424	the sportsmen in top - boots	5723	" Quite so;--but then the old lady said that I was perverse , and Colonel Stubbs took her part . If you had been there , Lady Albury , you would have thought that he had been in earnest . "
193467	193472	193474	193475	the Colonel	2361	" So I was , "
194076	194080	194082	194083	Lady Albury	542	" My dear , "
194085	194149	194151	194151	she	287	" there is something on the bed which I expect you to wear to - night . I shall be broken - hearted if it does n't fit you . The frock is a present from Sir Harry ; the scarf comes from me . Do n't say a word about it . Sir Harry always likes to make presents to young ladies . "
194339	194344	194345	194345	she	287	" Dear Lady Albury ! "
194348	194353	194345	194345	she	287	" dear Lady Albury ! "
195467	195489	195463	195463	his	5783	" To - night , Miss ; you must wear it to - night ! My lady would be quite angry ! "
195490	195513	195431	195434	the buxom powerful woman	5782	" My lady not know what you wear ! My lady knows what all the ladies wear,--morning , noon , and night . "
195670	195678	195679	195679	she	413	" Am I nice , Sir Harry ? "
195682	195687	195689	195690	Sir Harry	415	" Upon my word , "
195692	195711	195689	195690	Sir Harry	415	" that is the best spent ten - pound - note I ever laid out in my life . "
195735	195749	195750	195750	she	413	" I do n't know whether I am nice , but you are , "
195819	195828	195830	195831	Lady Albury	413	" You have won his heart for ever , "
195833	195837	195839	195839	Ayala	287	" Whose heart ? "
195845	195902	195903	195903	Baker	555	" Sir Harry 's heart . As for the other , cela va sans dire . You must go on wearing it every night for a week or Sir Harry will want to know why you have left it off . If the woman had made it on you it could n't have fitted better . Baker,-- "
195907	195937	195905	195907	the buxom female,--"said	9653	female,--"said that she knew it was right . You did that very prettily to Sir Harry . Now go up and ask Colonel Stubbs what he thinks of it . "
195938	195945	195947	195947	Ayala	287	" Indeed , I wo n't , "
196032	196042	196043	196043	she	413	" Do n't you think that girl very lovely ? "
196056	196063	196065	196066	Lord Rufford	439	" Something almost more than lovely , "
196079	196090	196092	196093	Lady Rufford	440	" Is it true about Colonel Stubbs and Miss Dormer ? "
196103	196115	196117	196118	Lady Albury	413	" Upon my word , I never inquire into those things , "
196120	196133	196117	196118	Lady Albury	413	" I suppose he does admire her . Everybody must admire her . "
196134	196138	196140	196141	Lady Rufford	440	" Oh yes ; "
196143	196157	196140	196141	Lady Rufford	440	" She is certainly very pretty . Who is she , Lady Albury ? "
196178	196223	196140	196141	Lady Rufford	440	" She is Miss Ayala Dormer . Her father was an artist , and her mother was a very handsome woman . When a girl is as beautiful as Miss Dormer , and as clever , it does n't much signify who she is . "
196245	196257	196259	196263	Captain Glomax of Colonel Stubbs	553	" Who is that young lady who sat next to you ? "
196271	196279	196259	196263	Captain Glomax of Colonel Stubbs	553	" She is a Miss Ayala Dormer . "
196280	196298	196259	196263	Captain Glomax of Colonel Stubbs	553	" Did I not see her out hunting with you once or twice early in the season ? "
196299	196334	196259	196263	Captain Glomax of Colonel Stubbs	553	" You saw her out hunting , no doubt , and I was there . I did not specially bring her . She was staying here , and rode one of Albury 's horses . "
196335	196346	196348	196349	Captain Glomax	553	" Take her top and bottom , and all round , "
196351	196391	196348	196349	Captain Glomax	553	" she is the prettiest little thing I 've seen for many a day . When she curtsyed to Sir Harry in the drawing - room I almost thought that I should like to be a marrying man myself . "
196411	196419	196421	196422	Sir Harry	415	" I did n't quite understand before , "
196429	196450	196421	196422	Sir Harry	415	" what it was that made Jonathan so furious about that girl ; but I think I see it now . "
196451	196458	196460	196461	his wife	672	" Fine feathers make fine birds , "
196465	196471	196473	196474	Sir Harry	415	" Feathers ever so fine , "
196476	196485	196473	196474	Sir Harry	415	" do n't make well - bred birds . "
196486	196492	196494	196495	Lady Albury	413	" To tell the truth , "
196497	196512	196494	196495	Lady Albury	413	" I think we shall all have to own that Jonathan has been right . "
196537	196549	196526	196527	Lady Albury	413	" We have had a terrible trouble about you , Ayala . "
196550	196565	196526	196527	Lady Albury	413	" A trouble about me , Lady Albury ? I should be so sorry . "
196566	196587	196526	196527	Lady Albury	413	" It is not exactly your fault;--but we have n't at all known what to do with that unfortunate man . "
196588	196592	196594	196594	Ayala	287	" What man ? "
196607	196630	196604	196605	Colonel Stubbs	385	" You naughty girl ! Do n't you know that my brother - in - law is broken - hearted about you ? "
196631	196635	196637	196637	Ayala	287	" Captain Batsby ! "
196644	196669	196640	196640	her	287	" Yes ; Captain Batsby . A Captain has as much right to be considered as a Colonel in such a matter as this . "
196678	196747	196670	196671	Here Ayala	287	" Of course , I ca n't help it , who may break his heart , but poor Ben is always supposed to be at Stalham just at this time of the year , and now I have been obliged to tell him one fib upon another to keep him away . When he comes to know it all , what on earth will he say to me ? "
196748	196759	196761	196761	Ayala	287	" I am sure it has not been my fault , "
196763	196777	196761	196761	Ayala	287	" That 's what young ladies always say when gentlemen break their hearts . "
197038	197043	197058	197059	Lady Albury	413	" cela va sans dire "
197419	197438	197439	197440	Lady Albury	413	" My dear , I am so sorry ; but I 'm afraid we ca n't mount you , "
197494	197507	197508	197509	Lady Rufford	440	" Lady Albury seems to be quite a kind friend to you , "
197566	197588	197613	197614	Lady Rufford	440	" A very kind friend , indeed . Some people only make friends of those who are as grand as themselves . "
197589	197611	197613	197614	Lady Rufford	440	" I am sure we should be very glad to see you at Rufford if you remain long in the country , "
197641	197651	197653	197653	Ayala	287	" I am not at all likely to stay , "
197655	197676	197653	197653	Ayala	287	" I live with my uncle and aunt at Notting Hill , and I very rarely go away from home . "
197736	197746	197748	197749	the Captain	3130	" I remember quite as if it were yesterday , "
197751	197762	197748	197749	the Captain	3130	" It was the day we rode the Cranbury Brook . "
197780	197787	197788	197788	she	287	" Mr. Twentyman rode over it , "
197791	197799	197788	197788	she	287	" and Colonel Stubbs rode into it . "
197800	197814	197815	197816	The Captain	3130	" Oh , yes ; Stubbs got a ducking ; so he did . "
197833	197841	197825	197825	he	3130	" It was a good run that . "
197842	197847	197788	197788	she	287	" I thought so . "
197848	197892	197788	197788	she	287	" We have n't been lucky since Sir Harry has had the hounds somehow . There does n't seem to be the dash about 'em there used to be when I was here . I had them before Sir Harry , you know . "
197901	197906	197908	197908	Ayala	287	" Were you Master ? "
197924	197962	197908	197908	Ayala	287	" Indeed I was , but the fag of it was too great , and the thanks too small , so I gave it up . They used to get four days a week out of me . "
198234	198239	198240	198240	she	287	" I always do , "
198243	198259	198240	198240	she	287	" if Rufford ventures to name a fox in the drawing - room after dinner . "
198517	198527	198528	198529	the Colonel	2361	" Have you found yourself dull without the hunting ? "
198534	198561	198528	198529	the Colonel	2361	" Oh dear no ; I must have a dull time if I do , seeing that I have only hunted three days in my life . "
198605	198618	198619	198619	he	2361	" I thought that perhaps you might have regretted the little pony , "
198622	198644	198619	198619	he	2361	" Because a thing has been very pleasant , it should not be regretted because it can not be had always . "
198645	198670	198682	198682	Ayala	287	" To me a thing may become so pleasant , that unless I can have it always my life must be one long regret . "
198671	198680	198682	198682	Ayala	287	" The pony is not quite like that , "
198732	198742	198743	198744	Lady Albury	413	" Of course there is a place for you , "
198750	198791	198743	198744	Lady Albury	413	" Had I wanted to go I would have made Sir Harry send the drag ; but I 've got to stop at home and see that the buttered toast is ready by the time the gentlemen all come back . "
198847	198853	198855	198855	Tony	433	" No , my lady , "
198857	198911	198855	198855	Tony	433	" I do n't like these sunshiny mornings at all ; there ai n't no kind of scent , and I goes riding about these big woods , up and down , till my shirt is as wet on my back with the sweat as though I 'd been pulled through the river . "
198951	198960	198962	198962	he	2361	" If you do n't regret that pony , "
198964	198969	198962	198962	he	2361	" somebody else does . "
198970	199015	198934	198935	the Colonel	2361	" I do regret him in one way , of course . I did like it very much ; but I do n't think it nice , when much has been done for me , to say that I want to have more done . "
199016	199025	198934	198935	the Colonel	2361	" Of course I knew what you meant . "
199026	199045	198962	198962	he	2361	" Perhaps you would go and tell Sir Harry , and then he would think me very ungrateful . "
199046	199049	199050	199050	he	2361	" Ayala , "
199053	199093	199050	199050	he	2361	" I will never say anything of you that will make anybody think evil of you . But , between ourselves , as Sir Harry is not here , I suppose I may confess that I regret the pony . "
199094	199103	199105	199105	Ayala	287	" I should like it , of course , "
199107	199193	199105	199105	Ayala	287	" And so should I,--so much ! I suppose all these men here would think me an ass if they knew how little I care about the day 's work,--whether we find , or whether we run , or whether we kill,--just because the pony is not here . If the pony were here I should have that feeling of expectation of joy , which is so common to girls when some much - thought - of ball or promised pleasure is just before them . "
199752	199761	199763	199763	Nina	426	" What was Colonel Stubbs saying to you ? "
199776	199790	199763	199763	Nina	426	" He was talking about the dear pony which I used to ride . "
199791	199796	199815	199815	she	287	" About nothing else ? "
199797	199802	199763	199763	Nina	426	" No;--about nothing else . "
199830	199851	199815	199815	she	287	" Ayala , why do you not tell me everything ? I told you everything as soon as it happened . "
199852	199857	199815	199815	she	287	" Nothing has happened . "
199858	199865	199867	199867	Nina	426	" I know he asked you , "
199869	199875	199867	199867	Nina	426	" And I answered him . "
199876	199883	199815	199815	she	287	" Is that to be everything ? "
199884	199891	199893	199893	Ayala	287	" Yes;--that is to be everything , "
200279	200295	200297	200298	Lady Albury	413	" We all knew that , my dear , as soon as he married her , "
200300	200308	200297	200298	Lady Albury	413	" Why did he marry a bore ? "
200309	200339	200297	200298	Lady Albury	413	" Because he wanted a wife to look after himself , and not to amuse his friends . The wonder used to be that he had done so well . "
200353	200355	200297	200298	Lady Albury	413	" Ayala "
200707	200710	200711	200711	he	439	" Ayala , "
200714	200723	200711	200711	he	439	" am I to have any other answer ? "
200724	200728	200699	200699	he	439	" What answer ? "
200729	200760	200699	200699	he	439	" Nay , my dearest,--my own , own dearest as I fain would have you,--who shall say what answer but you ? Ayala , you know that I love you ! "
200761	200770	200711	200711	he	439	" I thought you had given it up . "
200771	200879	200881	200881	he	5929	" Given it up . Never,--never ! Does a man give up his joy,--the pride of his life,--the one only delight on which his heart has set itself ! No , my darling , I have not given it up . Because you would not have it as I wished when I first spoke to you , I have not gone on troubling you . I thought I would wait till you were used again to the look of me , and to my voice . I shall never give it up , Ayala . When you came into the room that night with your new frock on-- "
200902	200926	200881	200881	he	5929	" When you came in and curtseyed to Sir Harry I could hardly keep within myself because I thought you were so beautiful . "
200927	200939	200881	200881	he	5929	" It was the new gown which he had given me . "
200940	201015	200881	200881	he	5929	" No , my pet;--no ! You may add a grace to a dress , but it can do but little for you . It was the little motion , the little word , the light in your eye ! It twinkles at me sometimes when you glance about , so that I do not know whether it is meant for me or not . I fear that it is never meant for me . "
201016	201023	201025	201025	Ayala	287	" It is meant for nothing , "
201027	201077	201025	201025	Ayala	287	" And yet it goes into my very bosom . When you were talking to that clergyman at dinner I could see every sparkle that came from it . Then I wonder to myself whether you can ever be thinking of me as I am always thinking of you . "
201105	201150	201081	201081	she	287	" Ayala , one little word , one other glance from your eyes , one slightest touch from your hand upon my arm , shall tell me,--shall tell me,--shall tell me that I am the happiest , the proudest man in all the world . "
201217	201228	201235	201235	she	287	" Ayala , how is it to be with me ? "
201229	201234	201235	201235	she	287	" I can not , "
201327	201332	201333	201333	she	287	" I can not , "
201337	201342	201333	201333	she	287	" I can not . "
201343	201353	201333	201333	she	287	" Is that to be your answer for ever ? "
201362	201370	201356	201356	she	287	" Must it be so , Ayala ? "
201371	201376	201377	201377	she	287	" I can not , "
201402	201412	201392	201392	she	287	" I will not make you unhappy , Ayala . "
201497	201505	201506	201506	he	5934	" Shall we go and join them ? "
201522	201528	201529	201529	she	287	" If you think so , "
201532	201557	201529	201529	she	287	" Perhaps it will be best , Ayala . Do not be angry with me now . I will not call you so again . "
201593	201618	201629	201630	Captain Glomax	553	" The hunted fox never went up Buddlecombe Hill;--never . If he did I 'll eat every fox in the Rufford and Ufford country . "
201647	201650	201644	201645	CHAPTER LI	531	" NO ! "
202095	202100	202101	202101	she	287	" I can not , "
202105	202110	202101	202101	she	287	" I can not . "
202124	202130	202131	202131	she	287	" I did love him , "
202259	202263	202256	202256	she	287	said,--"I can not . "
202420	202425	202400	202400	she	287	" Now I can , "
202655	202661	202663	202663	he	2361	" I have to own , "
202674	202682	202663	202663	he	2361	" that I thoroughly respect Miss Dormer . "
202683	202693	202663	202663	he	2361	" Why is she to be called Miss Dormer ? "
202694	202705	202663	202663	he	2361	" Because she has shown herself worthy of my respect . "
202706	202716	202663	202663	he	2361	" What is it that you mean , Jonathan ? "
202717	202768	202663	202663	he	2361	" She knew her own mind when she told me at first that she could not accept the offer which I did myself the honour of making her , and now she sticks to her purpose . I think that a young lady who will do that should be respected . "
202769	202776	202663	202663	he	2361	" She has refused you again ? "
202777	202780	202663	202663	he	2361	" Altogether . "
202781	202785	202663	202663	he	2361	" As how ? "
202786	202889	202663	202663	he	2361	" Well , I hardly know that I am prepared to explain the ' as how ' even to you . I am about as thick - skinned a man in such matters as you may find anywhere , but I do not know that even I can bring myself to tell the ' as how . ' The ' as how ' was very clear in one respect . It was manifest that she knew her own mind , which is a knowledge not in the possession of all young ladies . She told me that she could not marry me . "
202890	202897	202663	202663	he	2361	" I do not believe it . "
202898	202906	202663	202663	he	2361	" Not that she told me so ? "
202907	202944	202663	202663	he	2361	" Not that she knew her own mind . She is a little simple fool , who with some vagary in her brain is throwing away utterly her own happiness , while she is vexing you . "
202945	202954	202663	202663	he	2361	" As to the vexation you are right . "
202955	202962	202663	202663	he	2361	" Cross - grained little idiot ! "
202963	203004	202663	202663	he	2361	" An idiot she certainly is not ; and as to being cross - grained I have never found it . A human being with the grains running more directly all in the same way I have never come across . "
203005	203017	203018	203018	she	5973	" Do not talk to me , Jonathan , like that , "
203021	203041	203018	203018	she	5973	" When I call her cross - grained I mean that she is running counter to her own happiness . "
203042	203073	202663	202663	he	2361	" I can not tell anything about that . I should have endeavoured , I think , to make her happy . She has certainly run counter to my happiness . "
203074	203078	202663	202663	he	2361	" And now ? "
203079	203094	203018	203018	she	5973	" What;--as to this very moment ! I shall leave Stalham to - morrow . "
203095	203110	202663	202663	he	2361	" Why should you do that ? Let her go if one must go . "
203111	203129	202663	202663	he	2361	" That is just what I want to prevent . Why should she lose her little pleasure ? "
203130	203161	203162	203162	He	5974	" You do n't suppose that we can make the house happy to her now ! Why should we care to do so when she will have driven you away ? "
203183	203190	203192	203192	she	5975	" You must acknowledge , Jonathan , "
203194	203206	203192	203192	she	5975	" that I have taken kindly to this Ayala of yours . "
203207	203213	202663	202663	he	2361	" I do acknowledge it . "
203214	203295	202663	202663	he	2361	" But it can not be that she should be the same to us simply as a young lady , staying here as it were on her own behalf , as she was when we regarded her as your possible wife . Then every little trick and grace belonging to her endeared itself to us because we regarded her as one who was about to become one of ourselves . But what are her tricks and graces to us now ? "
203296	203305	203307	203308	the Colonel	2361	" They are all the world to me , "
203310	203330	203307	203308	the Colonel	2361	" But you must wipe them out of your memory,--unless , indeed , you mean to ask her again . "
203331	203336	202663	202663	he	2361	" Ah!--that is it . "
203337	203344	202663	202663	he	2361	" You will ask her again ? "
203345	203445	203307	203308	the Colonel	2361	" I do not say so ; but I do not wish to rob myself of the chance . It may be that I shall . Of course I should to - morrow if I thought there was a hope . To - morrow there would be none,--but I should like to know , that I could find her again in hands so friendly as yours , if at the end of a month I should think myself strong enough to encounter the risk of another refusal . Would Sir Harry allow her to remain here for another month ? "
203446	203457	202663	202663	he	2361	" He would say , probably , nothing about it . "
203458	203464	203465	203465	he	5977	" My plan is this , "
203468	203514	203465	203465	he	5977	" let her remain here , say , for three weeks or a month . Do you continue all your kindness to her,--if not for her sake then for mine . Let her feel that she is made one of yourselves , as you say . "
203515	203521	203523	203524	Lady Albury	413	" That will be hard , "
203526	203615	203523	203524	Lady Albury	413	" It would not be hard if you thought that she was going to become so at last . Try it , for my sake . Say not a word to her about me,--though not shunning my name . Be to her as though I had told you nothing of this . Then when the period is over I will come again,--if I find that I can do so . If my love is still stronger than my sense of self - respect , I shall do so . "
203633	203644	203646	203646	she	413	" Colonel Stubbs is going to Aldershot to - morrow , "
203657	203670	203676	203676	her	413	" He finds now that he can not very well remain away . "
203707	203712	203714	203714	Ayala	287	" Is he indeed ? "
203727	203750	203687	203687	her	413	" It is a great trouble to us , but we are quite unable to prevent it,--unless you indeed can control him . "
203751	203758	203760	203760	Ayala	287	" I can not control him , "
203803	203817	203819	203820	Sir Harry	415	" I never saw such a fellow as you are for sudden changes , "
203822	203867	203819	203820	Sir Harry	415	" What is the good of staying here for hunting when the ground and Tony 's temper are both as hard as brick - bats . If I go now I can get another week further on in March if the rain should come . "
203896	203904	203905	203905	he	2361	" Good - bye , Miss Dormer , "
203918	203923	203924	203924	she	287	" Good - bye , "
204049	204054	204045	204045	she	287	" I can not , "
204065	204069	204045	204045	she	287	" I can ? "
204537	204544	204546	204547	Lady Albury	413	" Going away to - morrow ? "
204549	204556	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Or perhaps the next day , "
204560	204578	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" My dear , it has been arranged that you should stay here for another three weeks . "
204579	204582	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" No . "
204583	204625	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" I say it was arranged . Everybody understood it . I am sure your aunt understood it . Because one person goes , everybody else is n't to follow so as to break up a party . Honour among thieves ! "
204626	204629	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Thieves ! "
204630	204715	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Well;--anything else you like to call us all . The party has been made up . And to tell the truth I do n't think that young ladies have the same right of changing their minds and rushing about as men assume . Young ladies ought to be more steady . Where am I to get another young lady at a moment 's notice to play lawn tennis with Mr. Greene ? Compose yourself and stay where you are like a good girl . "
204716	204723	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" What will Sir Harry say ? "
204724	204764	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Sir Harry will probably go on talking about the Stillborough fox and quarreling with that odious Captain Glomax . That is , if you remain here . If you go all of a sudden , he will perhaps hint-- "
204765	204772	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Hint what , Lady Albury ? "
204773	204789	204558	204558	Ayala	287	" Never mind . He shall make no hints if you are a good girl . "
204849	204865	204842	204843	Lady Albury	413	" it was because of Colonel Stubbs that you said that you would go away . "
204876	204886	204866	204866	Ayala	287	" Yes , it was because of Colonel Stubbs . "
204887	204891	204892	204892	Ayala	287	" And why ? "
204902	204904	204892	204892	Ayala	287	" Because-- "
204905	204911	204866	204866	Ayala	287	" Well , my dear ? "
204912	204923	204925	204925	Ayala	287	" I do n't think I ought to be asked , "
204927	204964	204925	204925	Ayala	287	" Well , you shall not be asked . I will not be cruel to you . But do you not know that if I ask anything it is with a view to your own good ? "
204965	204970	204972	204972	Ayala	287	" Oh , yes , "
204974	204987	204972	204972	Ayala	287	" But though I may not ask I suppose I may speak . "
205000	205027	204990	204990	Ayala	287	" You know , do you not , that I and Colonel Stubbs love each other like brother and sister,--more dearly than many brothers and sisters ? "
205028	205033	205131	205131	herself	287	" I suppose so . "
205034	205060	205131	205131	herself	287	" And that therefore he tells me everything . He told me what took place in the wood,--and because of that he has gone away . "
205061	205074	204990	204990	Ayala	287	" Of course you are angry with me;--because he has gone away . "
205075	205120	205131	205131	herself	287	" I am sorry that he has gone,--because of the cause of it . I always wish that he should have everything that he desires ; and now I wish that he should have this thing because he desires it above all other things . "
205225	205282	205209	205209	she	287	" But why should you go , Ayala , because he has gone ? Why should you say aloud that you had come here to listen to his offer , and that you had gone away as soon as you had resolved that , for this reason or that , it was not satisfactory to you ? "
205283	205289	205209	205209	she	287	" Oh , Lady Albury . "
205290	205318	205209	205209	she	287	" That would be the conclusion drawn . Remain here with us , and see if you can like us well enough to be one of us . "
205319	205330	205209	205209	she	287	" Dear Lady Albury , I do love you dearly . "
205331	205372	205209	205209	she	287	" What he may do I can not say . Whether he may bring himself to try once again I do not know,--nor will I ask you whether there might possibly be any other answer were he to do so . "
205373	205376	205378	205378	Ayala	287	" No ! "
205393	205441	205378	205378	Ayala	287	" I ask no questions about it , but I am sure it will be better for you to remain here for a few weeks . We will make you happy if we can , and you can learn to think over what has passed without emotion . "
205478	205481	205474	205474	she	287	" No , "

205827	205828	205819	205820	Lady Albury	413	he--"bring himself"--to
207849	207874	207844	207844	Ayala	287	" I know his nature so well , and feel that he would not bear rebuffs of which many another man would think nothing . "
207920	207924	207905	207905	She	287	words,--"I can not . "
207925	207930	207905	207905	She	287	" I can not . "
207931	207936	207905	207905	She	287	" I can not . "
208070	208079	208066	208068	no more coyness	6087	" If you will still have me,--oh yes ! "
208112	208124	208125	208125	she	287	" I will think of her on the 8th of April , "
208128	208149	208125	208125	she	287	" I shall then be at home at Kingsbury Crescent , and I shall have nothing else to think of . "
208259	208268	208269	208269	she	287	" I am so much obliged to you , "
208272	208417	208269	208269	she	287	" by your kindness about Colonel Stubbs . He did do me the honour of asking me to be his wife . And I felt it so . You are not to suppose that I did not understand that . It is all over now , and I can not explain to you why I felt that it would not do . It is all over , and therefore writing about it is no good . Only I want you to be sure of two things,--that there is no one else , and that I do love you so much for all your kindness . And you may be sure of a third thing , too,--that it is all over . I do hope that he will still let me be his friend . As a friend I have always liked him so much . "
208480	208489	208491	208492	Lady Albury	413	" The Captain certainly wo n't come now , "
208519	208525	208527	208528	Sir Harry	415	" Croppy has come back , "
208539	208556	208527	208528	Sir Harry	415	" Miss Dormer can have him now for what little there is left of the hunting . "
208633	208639	208641	208642	Sir Harry	415	" What does he say ? "
208647	208659	208661	208662	his wife	672	" I 'll show it you before you go to church , "
208723	208728	208729	208729	she	413	" That concerns you , "
208732	208739	208729	208729	she	413	" you had better read it . "
208815	208908	208791	208792	Lady Albury,--so	572	" I shall be at Stalham by the afternoon train on Sunday , 30th,--in time for dinner , if you will send the dog - cart . I could not leave this most exigeant of all places this week . I suppose Albury will go on in the woodlands for a week or ten days in April , and I must put up with that . I hear that Batsby is altogether fixed by the fascinations of Merle Park . I hope that you and Albury will receive consolation in the money . "
208915	208934	208791	208792	Lady Albury,--so	572	" If Croppy can be got back again , Miss Dormer might see me tumble into another river . "
209249	209253	209254	209254	he	6104	" Miss Dormer , "
209257	209302	209254	209254	he	6104	" the pony will hardly be fit to - morrow , and the distances during the rest of the week are all too great for you ; you had better wait till Monday week , when Stubbs will be here to look after you . "
209303	209312	209314	209314	Ayala	287	" But I am going home on Tuesday , "
209316	209328	209330	209331	Sir Harry	415	" I 've had the pony brought on purpose for you , "
209333	209341	209343	209344	Lady Albury	413	" You are not going at all , "
209346	209361	209343	209344	Lady Albury	413	" All that has to be altered . I 'll write to Mrs. Dosett . "
209362	209367	209369	209369	Ayala	287	" I do n't think-- "
209371	209380	209382	209383	Sir Harry	415	" I shall take it very much amiss , "
209385	209397	209382	209383	Sir Harry	415	" if you go now . Stubbs is coming on purpose . "
209398	209403	209405	209405	Ayala	287	" I do n't think-- "
209408	209421	209423	209424	Lady Albury	413	" My dear Ayala , it is n't a case for thinking , "
209426	209460	209423	209424	Lady Albury	413	" You most positively will not leave this house till some day in April , which will have to be settled hereafter . Do not let us have a word more about it . "
209995	210004	210005	210005	she	266	" I ought not to remain after that , "
210011	210026	210005	210005	she	266	" Though I went into the poor - house I ought not to remain . "
210027	210034	210035	210035	she	266	" I wrote to Mr. Hamel , "
210041	210060	210035	210035	she	266	" and told him that as you did not like my being here I had better,--better go away . "
210061	210094	210005	210005	she	266	" But where are you to go ? And I did n't say that I did n't like you being here . You ought n't to take me up in that way . "
210095	210117	210005	210005	she	266	" I do feel that I am in the way , aunt , and I think that I had better go . "
210118	210155	210035	210035	she	266	" But where are you to go ? I declare that everybody says everything to break my heart . Of course you are to remain here till he has got a house to keep you in . "
210292	210295	210297	210297	he	310	" If , "
210299	210363	210297	210297	he	310	" you acknowledge anything of the obedience of a son , that money is at your disposal,--and any other that you may want . But , if you determine to be as free from my control and as deaf to my advice as might be any other young man , then you must be to me as might be any other young man . "
210632	210639	210641	210642	the Colonel	2361	" Is she like her sister ? "
210653	210685	210641	210642	the Colonel	2361	" Hardly like her , although in truth there is a family likeness . Lucy is taller , with perhaps more regular features , and certainly more quiet in her manner . "
210686	210694	210696	210697	the lover	3798	" Ayala can be very quiet too , "
210699	210761	210696	210697	the lover	3798	" Oh , yes,--because she varies in her moods . I remember her almost as a child , when she would remain perfectly still for a quarter of an hour , and then would be up and about the house everywhere , glancing about like a ray of the sun reflected from a mirror as you move it in your hand . "
210762	210770	210772	210773	the Colonel	2361	" She has grown steadier since that , "
210775	210810	210772	210773	the Colonel	2361	" I can not imagine her to be steady,--not as Lucy is steady . Lucy , if it be necessary , can sit and fill herself with her own thoughts for the hour together . "
210811	210821	210696	210697	the lover	3798	" Which of them was most like their father ? "
210822	210869	210870	210870	She	6156	" They were both of them like him in their thorough love for things beautiful;--but they are both of them unlike him in this , that he was self - indulgent , while they , like women in general , are always devoting themselves to others . "
210899	210904	210906	210906	Hamel	310	" My poor Lucy , "
210908	210924	210906	210906	Hamel	310	" would fain devote herself to those around her if they would only permit it . "
210925	210935	210937	210938	the Colonel	2361	" She would probably prefer devoting herself to you , "
210940	210971	210937	210938	the Colonel	2361	" No doubt she would,--if it were expedient . If I may presume that she loves me , I may presume also that she would wish to live with me . "
210972	210978	210980	210981	the other	955	" Is it not expedient ? "
210983	210995	210980	210981	the other	955	" It will be so , I trust , before long . "
210996	211008	210906	210906	Hamel	310	" But it seems to be so necessary just at present . "
211020	211023	211025	211025	Stubbs	385	" If , "
211027	211049	211025	211025	Stubbs	385	" they treat her among them as you say , she ought at any rate to be relieved from her misery . "
211050	211063	210980	210981	the other	955	" She ought to be relieved certainly . She shall be relieved . "
211064	211074	210980	210981	the other	955	" But you say that it is not expedient . "
211075	211107	211025	211025	Stubbs	385	" I only meant that there were difficulties;--difficulties which will have to be got over . I think that all difficulties are got over when a man looks at them steadily . "
211108	211120	210980	210981	the other	955	" This , I suppose , is an affair of money . "
211121	211197	210980	210981	the other	955	" Well , yes . All difficulties seem to me to be an affair of money . A man , of course , would wish to earn enough before he marries to make his wife comfortable . I would struggle on as I am , and not be impatient , were it not that I fear she is more uncomfortable as she is now than she would be here in the midst of my poverty . "
211198	211232	211025	211025	Stubbs	385	" After all , Hamel , what is the extent of the poverty ? What are the real circumstances ? As you have gone so far you might as well tell me everything . "
211294	211300	211302	211303	the Colonel	2361	" Must that be paid ? "
211305	211315	211317	211317	Hamel	310	" I would starve rather than not pay it , "
211319	211349	211317	211317	Hamel	310	" if I alone were to be considered . It would certainly be paid within the next six months if I were alone , even though I should starve . "
211604	211612	211614	211615	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I never knew anything so hard , "
211617	211631	211614	211615	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Of course you have told him that it was all my fault . "
211647	211665	211640	211640	she	266	" I know that you have told him that I have turned you out,--which is not true . "
211666	211686	211614	211615	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I told him it was better I should go , as you did not like my being here . "
211687	211703	211705	211705	Augusta,--who	574	" I suppose Lucy was in a little hurry to have the marriage come off , "
211729	211735	211737	211737	Lucy	266	" I thought it best , "
211739	211754	211756	211757	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I 'm sure I do n't know how it is to be done , "
211759	211787	211756	211757	Aunt Emmeline	290	" You must tell your uncle yourself . I do n't know how you are to be married from here , seeing the trouble we are in . "
211788	211798	211800	211800	Gertrude	404	" We shall be up in London before that , "
211802	211810	211812	211813	Aunt Emmeline	290	" Or from Queen 's Gate either , "
211815	211833	211812	211813	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I do n't suppose that will much signify . I shall just go to the church . "
211834	211841	211843	211843	Gertrude	404	" Like a servant - maid ? "
211845	211852	211854	211854	Lucy	266	" Yes;--like a servant - maid , "
211856	211885	211854	211854	Lucy	266	" That is to say , a servant - maid would , I suppose , simply walk in and be married ; and I shall do the same . "
211886	211896	211898	211899	Aunt Emmeline	290	" I think you had better tell your uncle , "
211901	211938	211898	211899	Aunt Emmeline	290	" But I am sure I did not mean that you were to go away like this . It will be your own doing , and I can not help it if you will do it . "
211946	211958	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" And you mean to live upon three hundred a year ! "
211963	211974	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" You do n't know what you are talking about . "
211975	211982	211854	211854	Lucy	266	" I think Mr. Hamel knows . "
211983	212014	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" He is as ignorant as a babe unborn;--I mean about that kind of thing . I do n't doubt he can make things in stone as well as anybody . "
212015	212022	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" In marble , Uncle Tom . "
212023	212033	211854	211854	Lucy	266	" Marble is stone , I suppose;--or in iron . "
212034	212040	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" Bronze , Uncle Tom . "
212041	212071	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" Very well . There is iron in bronze , I suppose . But he does n't know what a wife will cost . Has he bought any furniture ? "
212072	212084	211854	211854	Lucy	266	" He is going to buy it,--just a little;--what will do ? "
212085	212096	211960	211961	Sir Thomas	271	" Why should you want to bring him into this ? "
212129	212136	212106	212106	himself	6181	" You are not happy here ? "
212137	212160	212106	212106	himself	6181	" My aunt and cousins think that I am wrong ; but I must be married to him now , Uncle Tom . "
212161	212176	212179	212179	he	6181	" Why did he kick up his heels when I wanted to help him ? "
212331	212346	212348	212349	Aunt Emmeline	493	" I suppose I am to have nothing to do in settling the day , "
212466	212501	212450	212450	his	271	" If it will not be altogether oppressive to his pride you may tell him that I shall make you an allowance of a hundred a year as my niece,--just for your personal expenses . "
212502	212516	212450	212450	his	271	" I do n't know that he is so proud , Uncle Tom . "
212517	212565	212450	212450	his	271	" He seemed so to me . But if you say nothing to him about it , and just buy a few gowns now and again , he will perhaps be so wrapt up in the higher affairs of his art as not to take any notice . "
212566	212577	212579	212579	Lucy	266	" I am sure he will notice what I wear , "
212700	212703	212705	212705	Gertrude	404	" Papa , "
212713	212727	212705	212705	Gertrude	404	" do n't you think you could do something for me too now ? "
212864	212877	212879	212879	Gertrude	404	" Do n't you think you could do something for me now ? "
212907	212911	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" those two idiots "
212920	212942	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Yes , my dear ; I will endeavour to do a good deal for you if you will behave yourself . "
212943	212953	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" What do you call behaving myself , papa ? "
212954	212973	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" In the first place telling me that you are very sorry for your misbehaviour with that idiot . "
212974	212986	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Of course I am sorry if I have offended you . "
212987	213002	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Well , that shall go for something . But how about the idiot ? "
213003	213006	213007	213007	she	6203	" Papa ! "
213010	213032	213007	213007	she	6203	" Was he not an idiot ? Would any one but an idiot have gone on such an errand as that ? "
213033	213044	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Gentlemen and ladies have done it before , papa . "
213045	213050	213051	213051	he	6204	" I doubt it , "
213054	213170	213051	213051	he	6204	" Gentlemen have run away with young ladies before , and generally have behaved very badly when they have done so . He behaved very badly indeed , because he had come to my house , with my sanction , with the express purpose of expressing his affection for another young lady . But I think that his folly in this special running away was worse even than his conduct . How did he come to think that he could get himself married merely by crossing over the sea to Ostend ? I should be utterly ashamed of him as a son - in - law,--chiefly because he has shown himself to be an idiot . "
213171	213185	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" But , papa , you will accept him , wo n't you ? "
213186	213196	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" No , my dear , I will not . "
213197	213204	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Not though I love him ? "
213205	213224	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" If I were to give you a choice which you would take , him or Mr. Houston ? "
213225	213231	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Houston is a scoundrel . "
213232	213296	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Very likely ; but then he is not an idiot . My choice would be altogether in favour of Mr. Houston . Shall I tell you what I will do , my dear ? I will consent to accept Captain Batsby as my son - in - law if he will consent to become your husband without having a shilling with you . "
213297	213305	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Would that be kind , papa ? "
213306	213353	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" I do not think that I can show you any greater kindness than to protect you from a man who I am quite sure does not care a farthing about you . He has , you tell me , an ample income of his own . "
213354	213360	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Oh yes , papa . "
213361	213437	212904	212905	Captain Batsby	290	" Then he can afford to marry you without a fortune . Poor Mr. Houston could not have done so , because he had nothing of his own . I declare , as I think of it all , I am becoming very tender - hearted towards Mr. Houston . Do n't you think we had better have Mr. Houston back again ? I suppose he would come if you were to send for him . "

213933	213940	213931	213932	the poet	6220	says,--"Faint heart never won fair lady . "

214330	214355	214309	214309	he	271	" Why not ? They ca n't eat you . Lady Albury is no more than a Baronet 's wife,--just the same as you . "
214356	214376	214309	214309	he	271	" It is n't about eating me , Tom . I should n't know what to say to them . "
214377	214396	214309	214309	he	271	" You need not tell them anything . Say that you had come to call upon your niece . "
214397	214421	214309	214309	he	271	" But it would be such an odd thing to do . I never do call on Ayala,--even when I am in London . "
214422	214470	214309	214309	he	271	" What does it matter being odd ? You could learn the truth at any rate . If she does not care for any one else why should n't she have me ? I could make her a baronet 's wife,--that is , some day when the governor-- "
214471	214481	214309	214309	he	271	" Do n't , Tom;--don't talk in that way . "
214482	214519	214309	214309	he	271	" I only mean in the course of nature . Sons do come after their fathers , you know . And as for money , I suppose the governor is quite as rich as those Alburys . "
214520	214529	214309	214309	he	271	" I do n't think that would matter . "
214530	214591	214309	214309	he	271	" It does count , mother . I suppose Ayala is the same as other girls in that respect . I am sure I do n't know why it is that she should have taken such an aversion to me . I suppose it is that she does n't think me so much,--quite such a swell as some other men . "
214592	214603	214309	214309	he	271	" One ca n't account for such things , Tom . "
214604	214657	214309	214309	he	271	" No;--that is just it . And therefore she might come round without accounting for it . At any rate , you might try . You might tell her that it is ruining me;--that I shall have to go about wandering over all the world because she is so hard - hearted . "
214658	214669	214671	214672	Lady Tringle	282	" I do n't think I could , my dear , "
214682	214693	214671	214672	Lady Tringle	282	" Why not ? Is it because of the trouble ? "
214694	214744	214309	214309	he	271	" No , my dear ; a mother does not think what trouble she may take for her child , if any good may be done . It is not the trouble . I would walk all round England to get her for you if that would do it . "
214745	214813	214309	214309	he	271	" Why not , then ? At any rate you might get an answer from her . She would tell you something of her intention . Mother , I shall never go away till I know more about it than I do now . The governor says that he will turn me out . Let him turn me out . That wo n't make me go away . "
214814	214825	214309	214309	he	271	" Oh , Tom , he does n't mean it . "
214826	214851	214309	214309	he	271	" But he says it . If I knew that it was all over,--that every chance was gone , then I would go away . "
214852	214864	214866	214867	Lady Tringle	282	" It is not the Alburys that I am afraid of , "
214869	214873	214866	214867	Lady Tringle	282	" What then ? "
214874	214891	214893	214893	she	282	" It is your father . I can not go if he will not let me . "
215073	215076	215077	215077	he	271	" Tom , "
215080	215094	215077	215077	he	271	" you will be pleased to remember that you start on the nineteenth . "
215095	215099	215113	215113	he	271	" But , father-- "
215100	215107	215109	215110	Sir Thomas	271	" You start on the nineteenth , "
215134	215141	215142	215142	Tom	271	" You have not asked him ? "
215150	215167	215142	215142	Tom	271	" Not yet , my dear . His mind is so disturbed by this unfortunate affair . "
215168	215207	215208	215209	Sir Thomas	271	" And is not my mind disturbed ? You may tell him that I will not go , though he should turn me out a dozen times , unless I know more about it than I do now . "
215377	215383	215384	215384	he	271	" You go to Stalham ! "
215387	215400	215384	215384	he	271	" Well , my dear , I suppose I could see her ? "
215401	215410	215368	215368	she	282	" And what could you learn from her ? "
215411	215449	215368	215368	she	282	" I do n't suppose I could learn much . She was always a pig - headed , stiff - necked creature . I am sure it would n't be any pleasure to me to see her . "
215450	215457	215384	215384	he	271	" What good would it do ? "
215462	215523	215384	215384	he	271	" Well , my dear ; he says that he wo n't go unless he can get a message from her . I am sure I do n't want to go to Stalham . Nothing on earth could be so disagreeable . But perhaps I could bring back a word or two which would make him go upon his journey . "
215524	215530	215368	215368	she	282	" What sort of word ? "
215531	215572	215368	215368	she	282	" Why;--if I were to say that she were engaged to this Colonel Stubbs , then he would go . He says that he would start at once if he knew that his cousin were really engaged to somebody else . "
215573	215580	215384	215384	he	271	" But if she be not ? "
215581	215630	215368	215368	she	282	" Perhaps I could just colour it a little . It would be such a grand thing to get him away , and he in this miserable condition ! If he were once on his travels , I do think he would soon begin to forget it all . "
215631	215637	215639	215640	Sir Thomas	271	" Of course he would , "
215642	215691	215639	215640	Sir Thomas	271	" Then I might as well try . He has set his heart upon it , and if he thinks that I have done his bidding then he will obey you . As for turning him out , Tom , of course you do not really mean that ! "
216214	216227	216265	216265	She	287	" I hope Lady Albury will not be surprised at my visit , "
216232	216264	216265	216265	She	287	" but I am so anxious to see you , just for half - an - hour , upon a matter of great importance , that I shall run my chance . "
216308	216341	216351	216352	Lady Tringle	282	" I shall be at home . Lady Albury will be very glad to see you at lunch . She says there shall be a room all ready if you will sleep . "
216342	216350	216351	216352	Lady Tringle	282	" I certainly shall not stay there , "
216358	216374	216351	216352	Lady Tringle	282	" but it is as well to know that they will be civil to me . "
216375	216387	216389	216389	Augusta	302	" They are stuck - up sort of people I believe , "
216391	216432	216389	216389	Augusta	302	" just like that Marchesa Baldoni , who is one of them . But , as to their being civil , that is a matter of course . They would hardly be uncivil to any one connected with Lord Boardotrade ! "
216645	216648	216650	216650	Tom	271	" Mother , "
216657	216668	216650	216650	Tom	271	" you will do the best you can for me . "
216669	216676	216636	216636	she	287	" Oh yes , my dear . "
216677	216709	216650	216650	Tom	271	" I do think that , if you would make her understand the real truth , she might have me yet . She would n't like that a fellow should die . "
216710	216723	216650	216650	Tom	271	" I am afraid that she is hard - hearted , Tom . "
216724	216761	216636	216636	she	287	" I do not believe it , mother . I have seen her when she would n't kill even a fly . If she could only be made to see all the good she could do . "
216762	216782	216650	216650	Tom	271	" I am afraid she wo n't care for that unless she can bring herself really to love you . "
216783	216791	216650	216650	Tom	271	" Why should n't she love me ? "
216792	216825	216636	216636	she	287	" Ah , my boy ; how am I to tell you ? Perhaps if you had n't loved her so well it might have been different . If you had scorned her-- "
216826	216929	216650	216650	Tom	271	" Scorn her ! I could n't scorn her . I have heard of that kind of thing before , but how is one to help oneself ? You ca n't scorn a friend just because you choose to say so to yourself . When I see her she is something so precious to me that I could not be rough to her to save my life . When she first came it was n't so . I could laugh at her then . But now-- ! They talk about goddesses , but I am sure she is a goddess to me . "
216930	216950	216650	216650	Tom	271	" If you had made no more than a woman of her it might have been better , Tom . "
217122	217125	217127	217127	Tom	353	" Mother ! "
217139	217162	217133	217133	she	282	" What is it , my dear ? I must really go now or I shall be too late for the train . "
217163	217177	217178	217179	His mother	7356	" Mother , tell her , tell her,--tell her that I love her . "
217566	217570	217572	217572	Ayala	287	" Dear aunt , "
217574	217585	217572	217572	Ayala	287	" I am so delighted to see you at Stalham ! "
217608	217613	217615	217615	she	287	" I do n't think "
217781	217788	217790	217791	Lady Albury	413	" Of course he wishes it , "
217793	217819	217790	217791	Lady Albury	413	" He has got the pony on purpose , and nobody likes being disappointed when he has done a thing so much as Sir Harry . "
218019	218034	218035	218035	she	413	" That man has , at any rate , been very true to you , "
218056	218073	218043	218043	her	287	" If she did not mean to take him now , surely she would have gone , "
218081	218090	218092	218093	Sir Harry	415	" She is a pretty little girl enough , "
218095	218107	218092	218093	Sir Harry	415	" but I doubt whether she is worth all the trouble . "
218108	218138	218043	218043	her	287	" Of course she is not . What pretty little girl ever was ? But as long as he thinks her worth it the trouble has to be taken . "
218139	218147	218092	218093	Sir Harry	415	" Of course she 'll accept him ? "
218148	218198	218043	218043	her	287	" I am not at all so sure of it . She has been made to believe that you wanted her to stay , and therefore she has stayed . She is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him . "
218338	218349	218350	218350	she	413	" Mind you are down at half - past seven , "
218362	218372	218350	218350	she	413	" I thought we should not dine till eight . "
218373	218400	218402	218402	Ayala	287	" There is no knowing . Sir Harry is so fussy . I shall be down , and I should like you to be with me . "
218405	218414	218402	218402	Ayala	287	" And mind you have his frock on . "
218415	218430	218431	218431	she	413	" You 'll make me wear it out before any one else sees it , "
218568	218579	218580	218580	she	413	" I 'll be there at half - past seven , "
218583	218604	218580	218580	she	413	" But I know the train will be late , and Sir Harry wo n't get his dinner till nine . "
218605	218642	218643	218645	The buxom woman	6000	" Then , my dear , great as the Colonel is , he may come in and get what is left for him in the middle . Sir Harry will not wait a minute after eight . "
218673	218688	218689	218689	she	413	" We have taken great care of it , have n't we , Miss ? "
218699	218707	218693	218693	she	413	" It 's just as new still . "
218708	218711	218713	218713	Ayala	287	" New ! "
218715	218730	218713	218713	Ayala	287	" It has got to be new with me for the next two years . "
218731	218763	218693	218693	she	413	" I do n't know much about that , Miss. Somebody will have to pay for a good many more new dresses before two years are over , I take it . "
219085	219093	219094	219094	she	413	" Your knight has come at last , "
219097	219106	219094	219094	she	413	" I hear his wheels on the gravel . "
219107	219115	219117	219117	Ayala	287	" He is no knight of mine , "
219126	219148	219124	219124	hers	287	" Whose ever knight he is , there he is . Knight or not , I must go and welcome him . "
219577	219595	219615	219615	she	287	ears,--"his own one , his wife , his darling , his Ayala , at last his own sweet Ayala,"--this
219710	219718	219700	219700	she	287	" Go;--go ; you must go now . "
219841	219849	219851	219852	Lady Albury	413	" I thought it would be so , "
219854	219862	219851	219852	Lady Albury	413	" I thought it would be so . "
219863	219873	219875	219876	Sir Harry	415	" What the deuce are you all up to , "
219883	219901	219875	219876	Sir Harry	415	" It 's eight now , and that man has only just gone up to his room . "
219902	219915	219917	219918	Lady Albury	413	" He has n't been in the house above five minutes yet , "
219920	219930	219917	219918	Lady Albury	413	" and I think he has been very quick . "
220050	220057	220059	220060	Sir Harry	415	" It 's a little sharp , "
220062	220069	220071	220071	Ayala	287	" Oh , pray do n't , "
220108	220128	220130	220131	Sir Harry	415	" I should not have liked to be either the pony , or the owner , or the lady , "
220192	220198	220199	220199	she	6369	" I always loved you , "
220266	220284	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" And so , like wise people , you have settled it all between you at last , "
220289	220299	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" I do n't know whether he is wise . "
220300	220317	220376	220376	Ayala	287	" We will take that for granted . At any rate he has been very true . "
220318	220323	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Oh , yes . "
220324	220332	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" And you,--you knew all about it . "
220333	220352	220376	220376	Ayala	287	" No;--I knew nothing . I did not think he would ever ask again . I only hoped . "
220353	220366	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" But why on earth did you give him so much trouble ? "
220367	220374	220379	220379	her	287	" I ca n't tell you , "
220382	220393	220379	220379	her	287	" Do you mean that there is still a secret ? "
220394	220450	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" No , not that . I would tell you anything that I could tell , because you have been so very , very good to me . But I can not tell . I can not explain even to myself . Oh , Lady Albury , why have you been so good to me ? "
220451	220461	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Shall I say because I have loved you ? "
220462	220468	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Yes;--if it be true . "
220469	220476	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" But it is not true . "
220477	220483	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Oh , Lady Albury ! "
220484	220531	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" I do love you dearly . I shall always love you now . I do hope I shall love you now , because you will be his wife . But I have not been kind to you as you call it because I loved you . "
220532	220536	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Then why ? "
220537	220603	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Because I loved him . Can not you understand that ? Because I was anxious that he should have all that he wanted . Was it not necessary that there should be some house in which he might meet you ? Could there have been much of a pleasant time for wooing between you in your aunt 's drawing - room in Kingsbury Crescent ? "
220604	220609	220611	220611	Ayala	287	" Oh , no , "
220613	220651	220611	220611	Ayala	287	" Could he have taken you out hunting unless you had been here ? How could he and you have known each other at all unless I had been kind to you ? Now you will understand . "
220652	220655	220657	220657	Ayala	287	" Yes , "
220659	220669	220657	220657	Ayala	287	" I understand now . Did he ask you ? "
220670	220712	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Well,--he consulted me . We talked you all over , and made up our minds , between us , that if we petted you down here that would be the best way to win you . Were we not right ? "
220713	220729	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" It was a very nice way . I do so like to be petted . "
220730	220757	220611	220611	Ayala	287	" Sir Harry was in the secret , and he did his petting by buying the frock . That was a success too , I think . "
220758	220768	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" Did he care about that , Lady Albury ? "
220769	220773	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" What he ? "
220774	220777	220779	220779	Ayala	287	" Jonathan , "
220797	220852	220788	220788	she	287	" I think he liked it . But whether he would have persevered without it you must ask yourself . If he tells you that he would never have said another word to you only for this frock , then I think you ought to thank Sir Harry , and give him a kiss . "
220853	220864	220866	220866	Ayala	287	" I am sure he will not tell me that , "
220872	220952	220286	220287	Lady Albury	413	" And now , my dear , as I have told you all my secret , and have explained to you how we laid our heads together , and plotted against you , I think you ought to tell me your secret . Why was it that you refused him so pertinaciously on that Sunday when you were out walking , and yet you knew your mind about it so clearly as soon as he arrived to - day ? "
220953	220960	220962	220962	Ayala	287	" I ca n't explain it , "
220964	220973	220962	220962	Ayala	287	" You must know that you liked him . "
220974	220980	220788	220788	she	287	" I always liked him . "
220981	220992	220788	220788	she	287	" You must have more than liked on that Sunday . "
220993	220998	220788	220788	she	287	" I adored him . "
220999	221007	220788	220788	she	287	" Then I do n't understand you . "
221008	221042	220788	220788	she	287	" Lady Albury , I think I fell in love with him the first moment I saw him . The Marchesa took me to a party in London , and there he was . "
221043	221052	220788	220788	she	287	" Did he say anything to you then ? "
221053	221094	220788	220788	she	287	" No . He was very funny,--as he often is . Do n't you know his way ? I remember every word he said to me . He came up without any introduction and ordered me to dance with him . "
221095	221100	220788	220788	she	287	" And you did ? "
221101	221171	220788	220788	she	287	" Oh yes . Whatever he told me I should have done . Then he scolded me because I did not stand up quick enough . And he invented some story about a woman who was engaged to him and would not marry him because he had red hair and his name was Jonathan . I knew it was all a joke , and yet I hated the woman . "
221172	221182	220788	220788	she	287	" That must have been love at first sight . "
221183	221202	220788	220788	she	287	" I think it was . From that day to this I have always been thinking about him . "
221203	221212	220788	220788	she	287	" And yet you refused him twice over ? "
221213	221216	220788	220788	she	287	" Yes . "
221217	221225	220788	220788	she	287	" At ever so long an interval ? "
221234	221238	221228	221228	her	287	" And why ? "
221239	221290	220788	220788	she	287	" Ah;--that I ca n't tell . I shall try to tell him some day , but I know that I never shall . It was because-- . But , Lady Albury , I can not tell it . Did you ever picture anything to yourself in a waking dream ? "
221291	221298	221300	221301	Lady Albury	413	" Build castles in the air ? "
221303	221309	221300	221301	Lady Albury	413	" That 's just it . "
221310	221320	220788	220788	she	287	" Very often . But they never come true . "
221321	221343	221344	221344	She	413	" Never have come true,--exactly . I had a castle in the air , and in the castle lived a knight . "
221362	221380	221357	221360	an Angel of Light	2048	" I wanted to find out whether he was the knight who lived there . He was . "
221381	221393	220788	220788	she	287	" And you were not quite sure till to - day ? "
221394	221449	220788	220788	she	287	" I have been sure a long time . But when we walked out on that Sunday I was such an idiot that I did not know how to tell him . Oh , Lady Albury , I was such a fool ! What should I have done if he had n't come back ? "
221450	221455	221357	221360	an Angel of Light	2048	" Sent for him . "
221456	221473	220788	220788	she	287	" Never;--never ! I should have been miserable always ! But now I am so happy . "
221474	221481	220788	220788	she	287	" He is the real knight ? "
221482	221504	221357	221360	an Angel of Light	2048	" Oh , yes ; indeed . He is the real,--real knight , that has always been living in my castle . "
221546	221553	221555	221557	the buxom female	6380	" I take it , Miss , "
221559	221576	221555	221557	the buxom female	6380	" there will be a many new dresses before the end of this time two years . "
221769	221774	221763	221763	he	1169	" Angel of Light . "
221992	222006	222008	222009	Larry Twentyman	434	" I am delighted to see you again in these parts , Miss , "
222013	222024	222008	222009	Larry Twentyman	434	" Oh , Mr. Twentyman ; how is the baby ? "
222025	222043	222174	222175	Larry Twentyman	434	" The baby is quite well , Miss. His mamma has been out ever so many times . "
222044	222060	222008	222009	Larry Twentyman	434	" I ought to have asked for her first . Does baby come out too ? "
222061	222168	222008	222009	Larry Twentyman	434	" Not quite . But when the hounds are near mamma comes for an hour or so . We have had a wonderful season,--quite wonderful . You have heard , perhaps , of our great run from Dillsborough Wood . We found him there , close to my place , you know , and run him down in the Brake country after an hour and forty minutes . There were only five or six of them . You 'd have been one , Miss , to a moral , if you 'd have been here on the pony . I say we never changed our fox . "
222376	222390	222392	222393	the Colonel	2361	" After that Croppy will be quite fit to come again on Wednesday , "
222405	222417	222468	222468	herself	413	" What do you folks mean to do to - day ? "
222447	222462	222464	222465	Lady Albury	413	" Will you choose to be driven , or will you choose to walk ? "
222515	222527	222529	222529	Ayala	287	" Walk with me to the wood with that absurd name , "
222531	222535	222537	222538	the Colonel	2361	" Gobblegoose Wood , "
222665	222667	222662	222662	she	287	" No "
222683	222686	222677	222677	she	287	" Yes . "
222945	222952	222953	222953	she	287	" Do you remember this path ? "
222956	222968	222969	222969	he	2361	" I remember that you and I were walking here together , "
222972	222986	222969	222969	he	2361	" Ay , but this very turn ? Do you remember this branch ? "
222987	222996	222941	222941	her	287	" Well , no ; not the branch . "
222997	223017	222969	222969	he	2361	" You put your hand on it when you said that ' never -- never , ' to me . "
223018	223026	222969	222969	he	2361	" Did I say ' never,--never ' ? "
223027	223039	222941	222941	her	287	" Yes , you did;--when I was so untrue to you . "
223040	223045	223046	223046	he	2361	" Were you untrue ? "
223049	223078	223046	223046	he	2361	" Jonathan , you remember nothing about it . It has all passed away from you just as though you were talking to Captain Glomax about the fox . "
223079	223085	222941	222941	her	287	" Has it , dear ? "
223086	223144	223046	223046	he	2361	" I remember every word of it . I remember how you stood and how you looked , even to the hat you wore and the little switch you held in your hand,--when you asked for one little word , one glance , one slightest touch . There , now;--you shall have all my weight to bear . "
223177	223193	223168	223168	her	6420	" Do you remember that I said I thought you had given it all up ? "
223194	223201	223146	223146	she	6420	" I remember that , certainly . "
223202	223229	223146	223146	she	6420	" And was not that untrue ? Oh , Jonathan , that was such a story . Had I thought so I should have been miserable . "
223230	223247	223168	223168	her	6420	" Then why did you swear to me so often that you could not love me ? "
223248	223254	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" I never said so , "
223258	223261	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" never . "
223262	223267	223268	223268	he	2361	" Did you not ? "
223271	223313	223268	223268	he	2361	" I never said so . I never told you such a story as that . I did love you then , almost as well as I do now . Oh , I had loved you for so long a time ! "
223314	223322	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Then why did you refuse me ? "
223323	223369	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Ah ; that is what I would explain to you now,--here on this very spot,--if I could . Does it not seem odd that a girl should have all that she wants offered to her , and yet not be able to take it ? "
223370	223378	223268	223268	he	2361	" Was it all that you wanted ? "
223379	223410	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Indeed it was . When I was in church that morning I told myself that I never , never , could be happy unless you came to me again . "
223411	223423	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" But when I did come you would not have me . "
223424	223432	223433	223433	she	6421	" I knew how to love you , "
223436	223461	223433	223433	she	6421	" but I did not know how to tell you that I loved you . I can tell you now ; can not I ? "
223472	223528	223464	223464	she	6421	" Yes , I think I shall never be tired of telling you now . It is sweet to hear you say that you love me , but it is sweeter still to be always telling you . And yet I could not tell you then . Suppose you had taken me at my word ? "
223529	223541	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" I told you that I should never give you up . "
223542	223620	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" It was only that that kept me from being altogether wretched . I think that I was ashamed to tell you the truth when I had once refused to do as you would have me . I had given you so much trouble all for nothing . I think that if you had asked me on that first day at the ball in London I should have said yes , if I had told the truth . "
223621	223637	223464	223464	she	6421	" That would have been very sudden . I had never seen you before that . "
223638	223697	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Nevertheless it was so . I do n't mind owning it to you now , though I never , never , would own it to any one else . When you came to us at the theatre I was sure that no one else could ever have been so good . I certainly did love you then . "
223698	223704	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Hardly that , Ayala . "
223705	223709	223710	223710	she	6423	" I did , "
223713	223744	223710	223710	she	6423	" Now I have told you everything , and if you choose to think I have been bad,--why you must think so , and I must put up with it . "
223745	223751	223256	223256	Ayala	287	" Bad , my darling ? "
223752	223821	223710	223710	she	6423	" I suppose it was bad to fall in love with a man like that ; and very bad to give him the trouble of coming so often . But now I have made a clean breast of it , and if you want to scold me you must scold me now . You may do it now , but you must never scold me afterwards,--because of that . "
223863	223878	223845	223845	she	636	" I have heard it all from Lucy;--how generous you have been to Isadore . "
223879	223887	223888	223888	he	6427	" That has all come to nothing , "
223891	223906	223888	223888	he	6427	" How come to nothing ? I know that you sent him the money . "
223907	223939	223845	223845	she	636	" I did offer to lend him something , and , indeed , I sent him a cheque ; but two days afterwards he returned it . That tremendous uncle of yours-- "
223940	223944	223845	223845	she	636	" Uncle Tom ? "
223945	224010	223888	223888	he	6427	" Yes , your Uncle Tom ; the man of millions ! He came forward and cut me out altogether . I do n't know what went on down there in Sussex , but when he heard that they intended to be married shortly he put his hand into his pocket , as a magnificent uncle , overflowing with millions , ought to do . "
224011	224018	223845	223845	she	636	" I did not hear that . "
224019	224028	223845	223845	she	636	" Hamel sent my money back at once . "
224029	224042	223888	223888	he	6427	" And poor Tom ! You were so good to poor Tom . "
224043	224048	223888	223888	he	6427	" I like Tom . "
224049	224056	223845	223845	she	636	" But he did behave badly . "
224057	224105	223845	223845	she	636	" Well ; yes . One gentleman should n't strike another , even though he be ever so much in love . It 's an uncomfortable proceeding , and never has good results . But then , poor fellow , he has been so much in earnest . "
224106	224119	223888	223888	he	6427	" Why could n't he take a No when he got it ? "
224120	224133	223845	223845	she	636	" Why did n't I take a No when I got it ? "
224134	224177	223845	223845	she	636	" That was very different . He ought to have taken it . If you had taken it you would have been very wrong , and have broken a poor girl 's heart . I am sure you knew that all through . "
224178	224182	223888	223888	he	6427	" Did I ? "
224183	224249	223888	223888	he	6427	" And then you were too good - natured . That was it . I do n't think you really love me;--not as I love you . Oh , Jonathan , if you were to change your mind now ! Suppose you were to tell me that it was a mistake ! Suppose I were to awake and find myself in bed at Kingsbury Crescent ? "
224250	224262	223845	223845	she	636	" I hope there may be no such waking as that ! "
224263	224336	223888	223888	he	6427	" I should go mad,--stark mad . Shake me till I find out whether it is real waking , downright , earnest . But , Jonathan , why did you call me Miss Dormer when you went away ? That was the worst of all . I remember when you called me Ayala first . It went through and through me like an electric shock . But you never saw it;--did you ? "
224364	224471	224344	224344	she	6429	" I am sure Isadore is second best , but Jonathan is best . I do n't want you to say so ; but if you contradict me I shall stick to it . You remember my telling you that the old woman in the railway said that I was perverse . She was a clever old woman , and knew all about it , for I was perverse . However , it has come all right now , and Jonathan is best of all . Oh , my man,--my man ! Is it not sweet to have a man of one 's own to love ? "
224685	224689	224691	224691	she	287	" a joy for ever,"--but
224739	224745	224747	224748	Sir Harry	415	" like a little brick , "
224807	224810	224812	224812	Nina	426	" Jonathan . "
224916	224927	224929	224929	Ayala	287	" But she ca n't do that , you know , "
224936	224963	224929	224929	Ayala	287	" She is nothing to me now , Lady Albury . She got rid of me , you know . I was changed away for Lucy . "
224964	224978	224980	224981	Lady Albury	413	" If there had been no changing away , she could do nothing , "
225095	225106	225111	225111	she	287	" I am so delighted to see you at Stalham , "
225116	225123	225125	225126	Lady Tringle	282	" I am come to you , "
225128	225137	225125	225126	Lady Tringle	282	" on a matter of very particular business . "
225150	225157	225159	225159	Ayala	287	" Have you got my letter ? "
225161	225204	225139	225139	she	282	" I got your telegram , and I thought it very civil of Lady Albury . But I can not stay . Your poor cousin Tom is in such a condition that I can not leave him longer than I can help . "
225205	225214	225139	225139	she	282	" But you have not got my letter ? "
225215	225226	225139	225139	she	282	" I have had no letter from you , Ayala . "
225227	225241	225139	225139	she	282	" I have sent you such news,--oh , such news , Aunt Emmeline ! "
225242	225249	225253	225253	she	282	" What news , my dear ? "
225265	225273	225253	225253	she	282	" Oh , Aunt Emmeline-- ; I am-- "
225274	225281	225139	225139	she	282	" You are what , Ayala ? "
225282	225294	225139	225139	she	282	" I am engaged to be married to Colonel Jonathan Stubbs . "
225295	225298	225253	225253	she	282	" Engaged ! "
225299	225426	225139	225139	she	282	" Yes , Aunt Emmeline;--engaged . I wrote to you on Tuesday to tell you all about it . I hope you and Uncle Tom will approve . There can not possibly be any reason against it,--except only that I have nothing to give him in return ; that is in the way of money . Colonel Stubbs , Aunt Emmeline , is not what Uncle Tom will call a rich man , but everybody here says that he has got quite enough to be comfortable . If he had nothing in the world it could not make any difference to me . I do n't understand how anybody is to love any one or not to love him just because he is rich or poor . "
225427	225434	225436	225437	Lady Tringle	282	" But you are absolutely engaged ! "
225439	225464	225436	225437	Lady Tringle	282	" Oh dear yes . Perhaps you would like to ask Lady Albury about it . He did want it before , you know . "
225465	225474	225139	225139	she	282	" But now you are engaged to him ? "
225489	225496	225486	225486	her	287	" It is all over then ? "
225497	225501	225503	225503	Ayala	287	" All over ! "
225505	225513	225503	225503	Ayala	287	" It is just going to begin . "
225514	225521	225523	225524	Lady Tringle	282	" All over for poor Tom , "
225526	225566	225523	225524	Lady Tringle	282	" Oh yes . It was always over for him , Aunt Emmeline . I told him ever so many times that it never could be so . Do n't you know , Aunt Emmeline , that I did ? "
225567	225579	225503	225503	Ayala	287	" But you said that to this man just the same . "
225580	225584	225586	225586	Ayala	287	" Aunt Emmeline , "
225601	225666	225586	225586	Ayala	287	" I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs , and nothing on earth that anybody can say can change it . If you want to hear all about it , Lady Albury will tell you . She knows that you are my aunt , and therefore she will be quite willing to talk to you . Only nothing that anybody can say can change it . "
225667	225671	225503	225503	Ayala	287	" Poor Tom ! "
225679	225690	225503	225503	Ayala	287	" I am very sorry if my cousin is displeased . "
225691	225737	225586	225586	Ayala	287	" He is ill,--terribly ill . He will have to go away and travel all about the world , and I do n't know that ever he will come back again . I am sure this Stubbs will never love you as he has done . "
225738	225750	225586	225586	Ayala	287	" Oh , aunt , what is the use of that ? "
225751	225764	225765	225765	Ayala	287	" And then Tom will have twice as much . But , however-- "
225784	225809	225765	225765	Ayala	287	" I will go and tell him , my dear , that 's all . Will you not send him some message , Ayala ? "
225810	225852	225586	225586	Ayala	287	" Oh , yes ; any message that I can that shall go along with my sincere attachment to Colonel Stubbs . You must tell him that I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs . You will tell him , Aunt Emmeline ? "
225853	225864	225871	225871	Ayala	287	" Oh , yes ; if it must be so . "
225865	225869	225871	225871	Ayala	287	" It must , "
225873	225917	225871	225871	Ayala	287	" Then you may give him my love , and tell him that I am very unhappy that I should have been a trouble to him , and that I hope he will soon be well , and come back from his travels . "
225928	225941	225921	225922	Aunt Emmeline	493	" I could not help it , Aunt Emmeline , could I ? "
225993	226004	225981	225981	she	287	" I could not help it,--could I , Aunt Emmeline ? "
226005	226013	225971	225971	they	6454	" I suppose not , my dear . "
226207	226215	226217	226217	Ayala	287	" But he never spoke to me , "
226219	226230	226232	226233	the Colonel	2361	" He does n't speak very much to any one , "
226235	226282	226232	226233	the Colonel	2361	" but he thinks a great deal about things . He has had ever so many affairs with ever so many ladies , who generally , I fancy , want to marry him because of his money . How he has escaped so long nobody knows . "
226304	226307	226232	226233	the Colonel	2361	" escaping , "
226377	226385	226387	226388	Sir Harry	415	" What do you think has happened ? "
226400	226405	226407	226408	his wife	672	" What has happened ? "
226410	226422	226407	226408	his wife	672	" Benjamin has run off to Ostend with a young lady . "
226423	226429	226431	226432	Lady Albury	413	" Benjamin,--with a young lady ! "
226464	226472	226436	226436	Stubbs	385	" Ayala , that is your doing ! "
226473	226476	226478	226478	Ayala	287	" No ! "
226480	226491	226478	226478	Ayala	287	" But I am very glad if he 's happy . "
226492	226499	226501	226501	Stubbs	385	" Who is the young lady ? "
226503	226514	226516	226517	Sir Harry	415	" It is that which makes it so very peculiar , "
226542	226549	226551	226552	her ladyship	2738	" Who is it , Harry ? "
226554	226562	226551	226552	her ladyship	2738	" Sir Thomas Tringle 's younger daughter . "
226563	226566	226568	226568	Ayala	287	" Gertrude ! "
226580	226588	226590	226591	Sir Harry	415	" But the worst of it is , "
226593	226618	226590	226591	Sir Harry	415	" that he is not at all happy . The young lady has come back , while nobody knows what has become of Benjamin . "
226619	226627	226629	226630	Lady Albury	413	" Benjamin never will get a wife , "
227009	227012	227014	227016	a friend of	6499	so,--"sneaked back , "
227423	227428	227429	227429	he	271	" I knew it , "
227432	227474	227429	227429	he	271	" I knew it . Nothing could have prevented it unless I had shot him through the heart . He told me that she had refused him ; but no man could have looked like that after being refused by Ayala . "
227879	227885	227887	227888	Sir Thomas	271	" Well , Captain Batsby , "
227890	227914	227887	227888	Sir Thomas	271	" what can I do for you now ? I am glad to see that you have come back safely from foreign parts . "
227915	227920	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" I have called , "
227925	227933	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" to say something about your daughter . "
227934	227945	227887	227888	Sir Thomas	271	" What more can you have to say about her ? "
227966	227983	227956	227957	Sir Thomas	271	" The way in which we were separated at Ostend was very distressing to my feelings . "
227984	227988	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" I daresay . "
227989	228000	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" And also I should think to Miss Tringle 's . "
228001	228039	227956	227957	Sir Thomas	271	" Not improbably . I have always observed that when people are interrupted in the performance of some egregious stupidity their feelings are hurt . As I said before , what can I do for you now ? "
228040	228061	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" I am very anxious to complete the alliance which I have done myself the honour to propose to you . "
228062	228108	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" I did not know that you had proposed anything . You came down to my house under a false pretence ; and then you persuaded my daughter,--or else she persuaded you,--to go off together to Ostend . Is that what you call an alliance ? "
228109	228121	227956	227957	Sir Thomas	271	" That , as far as it went was,--was an elopement . "
228122	228146	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" Am I to understand that you now want to arrange another elopement , and that you have come to ask my consent ? "
228147	228152	227922	227923	the Captain	3130	" Oh dear no . "
228153	228164	227956	227957	Sir Thomas	271	" Then what do you mean by completing an alliance ? "
228165	228171	228173	228174	the Captain	3130	" I want to make , "
228176	228235	228173	228174	the Captain	3130	" an offer for the young lady 's hand in a proper form . I consider myself to be in a position which justifies me in doing so . I am possessed of the young lady 's affections , and have means of my own equal to those which I presume you will be disposed to give her . "
228236	228398	227956	227957	Sir Thomas	271	" Very much better means I hope , Captain Batsby . Otherwise I do not see what you and your wife would have to live upon . I will tell you exactly what my feelings are in this matter . My daughter has gone off with you , forgetting all the duty that she owed to me and to her mother , and throwing aside all ideas of propriety . After that I will not say that you shall not marry her if both of you think fit . I do not doubt your means , and I have no reason for supposing that you would be cruel to her . You are two fools , but after all fools must live in the world . What I do say is , that I will not give a sixpence towards supporting you in your folly . Now , Captain Batsby , you can complete the alliance or not as you please . "
228514	228518	228520	228520	he	290	" Sir Thomas , "
228522	228539	228520	228520	he	290	" fool and folly are terms which I can not allow you to use to me . "
228540	228575	228813	228813	he	6544	" If you do not present yourself to me here , Captain Batsby , or at my own house,--or , perhaps I may say , at Ostend,--I will use no such terms to you . "
228576	228594	228813	228813	he	6544	" I suppose you will acknowledge that I am entitled to ask for your daughter 's hand . "
228595	228621	228520	228520	he	290	" I suppose you will acknowledge that when a man runs away with my daughter I am entitled to express my opinion of his conduct . "
228622	228663	228813	228813	he	6544	" That is all over now , Sir Thomas . What I did I did for love . There is no good in crying over spilt milk . The question is as to the future happiness of the young lady . "
228664	228784	228813	228813	he	6544	" That is the only wise word I have heard you say , Captain Batsby . There is no good in crying after spilt milk . Our journey to Ostend is done and gone . It was not very agreeable , but we have lived through it . I quite think that you show a good judgment in not intending to go there again in quest of a clergyman . If you want to be married there are plenty of them in London . I will not oppose your marriage , but I will not give you a shilling . No man ever had a better opportunity of showing the disinterestedness of his affection . Now , good morning . "
228785	228790	228813	228813	he	6544	" But , Sir Thomas-- "
228791	228811	228813	228813	he	6544	" Captain Batsby , my time is precious . I have told you all that there is to tell . "
228840	228849	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Do you want to marry Captain Batsby ? "
228870	228876	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , I do . "
228877	228891	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" You think that you prefer him on the whole to Mr. Houston ? "
228892	228911	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Mr. Houston is a scoundrel . I wish that you would not talk about him , papa . "
228912	228924	228926	228927	Sir Thomas	271	" I like him so much the best of the two , "
228929	228965	228926	228927	Sir Thomas	271	" But of course it is for you to judge . I could have brought myself to give something to Houston . Luckily , however , Captain Batsby has got an income of his own . "
228966	228972	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" He has , papa . "
228973	228989	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" And you are sure that you would like to take him as your husband ? "
228990	228995	228926	228927	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , papa . "
228996	229009	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Very well . He has been with me to - day . "
229010	229016	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Is he in London ? "
229017	229034	228926	228927	Sir Thomas	271	" I tell you that he has been with me to - day in Lombard Street . "
229035	229048	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" What did he say ? Did he say anything about me ? "
229049	229064	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" Yes , my dear . He came to ask me for your hand . "
229065	229070	228926	228927	Sir Thomas	271	" Well , papa . "
229071	229140	228850	228851	Sir Thomas	271	" I told him that I should make no objection,--that I should leave it altogether to you . I only interfered with one small detail as to my own wishes . I assured him that I should never give him or you a single shilling . I do n't suppose it will matter much to him , as he has , you know , means of his own . "
229203	229212	229214	229214	Augusta	302	" It is such a very serious thing , "
229219	229234	229214	229214	Augusta	302	" to be four hours on the sea together ! And then you know-- ! "
229268	229303	229250	229250	he	321	" Papa , you know , understands nothing about these kind of things . You , with your family interest , and your seat in Parliament , ought to be able to arrange it . "
229412	229423	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" So you have come back from your little trip ? "
229462	229470	229459	229460	Mr. Traffick	321	" Yes ; I have come back . "
229471	229476	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Without your bride . "
229477	229506	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Without my bride,--as yet . That is a kind of undertaking in which a man is apt to run many dangers before he can carry it through . "
229507	229538	229459	229460	Mr. Traffick	321	" I dare say . I never did anything of the kind myself . Of course you know that I am the young lady 's brother - in - law . "
229539	229543	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Oh yes . "
229544	229565	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" And therefore you wo n't mind me speaking . Do n't you think you ought to do something further ? "
229566	229578	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" Something further ! By George , I should think so , "
229585	229608	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" I mean to do a great many things further . You do n't suppose I am going to give it up ? "
229609	229648	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" You ought n't , you know . When a man has taken a girl off with him in that way , he should go on with it . It 's a deuced serious thing , you know . "
229649	229659	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" It was his fault in coming after us . "
229660	229697	229425	229428	the Member of Parliament	4162	" That was a matter of course . If he had n't done it , I must . I have made the family my own , and , of course , must look after its honour . "
229729	229739	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" He made himself very rough , you know , "
229744	229751	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" I dare say he would . "
229752	229764	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" And said things,--well,--things which he ought not to have said . "
229765	229782	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" In such a case as that a father may say pretty nearly what comes uppermost . "
229783	229800	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" That was just it . He did say what came uppermost,--and very rough it was . "
229801	229807	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" What does it matter ? "
229808	229852	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" Not much if he 'd do as he ought to do now . As you are her brother - in - law , I 'll tell you just how it stands . I have been to him and made a regular proposal . "
229853	229860	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" Since you have been back ? "
229861	229877	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" Yes ; the day before yesterday . And what do you think he says ? "
229878	229884	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" What does he say ? "
229885	229892	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" He gives his consent ; only-- "
229893	229897	229580	229581	the Captain	3130	" Only what ? "
229898	229933	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" He wo n't give her a shilling ! Such an idea , you know ! As though she were to be punished after marriage for running away with the man she did marry . "
229934	229941	229943	229946	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Take your chance , Batsby , "
229948	229952	229943	229946	the Member of Parliament	4162	" What chance ? "
229953	229992	229741	229742	the Captain	3130	" Take your chance of the money . I 'd have done it ; only , of course , it was different with me . He was glad to catch me , and therefore the money was settled . "
229993	230007	230009	230010	the Captain	3130	" I 've got a tidy income of my own , you know , "
230041	230046	230048	230048	Traffick	321	" Take your chance , "
230050	230101	230048	230048	Traffick	321	" What on earth can a man like Tringle do with his money except give it to his children ? He is rough , as you say , but he is not hard - hearted , nor yet stubborn . I can do pretty nearly what I like with him . "
230102	230108	230172	230172	he	321	" Can you , though ? "
230109	230136	230137	230138	The Captain	3130	" Yes ; by smoothing him down the right way . You run your chance , and we 'll get it all put right for you . "
230189	230209	230211	230212	Mr. Traffick	321	" I do n't see how you can hesitate now , as you have been off with the girl , "
230214	230231	230211	230212	Mr. Traffick	321	" I do n't know about that . I should like to see the money settled . "
230232	230247	230256	230257	the Captain	3130	" There would have been nothing settled if you had married her at Ostend . "
230248	230254	230256	230257	the Captain	3130	" But I did n't , "
230259	230294	230256	230257	the Captain	3130	" I tell you what you might do . You might talk him over and make him a little more reasonable . I should be ready to - morrow if he 'd come forward . "
230295	230303	230256	230257	the Captain	3130	" What 's the sum you want ? "
230304	230313	230256	230257	the Captain	3130	" The same as yours , I suppose . "
230314	230322	230324	230325	Mr. Traffick	321	" That 's out of the question , "
230331	230339	230328	230328	his	321	" Suppose we say sixty thousand pounds . "
231252	231263	231249	231250	the Member	6617	" No ; I have not spoken to him yet . "
231264	231275	231277	231277	Batsby	290	" I was with him on Friday , you know , "
231279	231304	231277	231277	Batsby	290	" I ca n't well go and call on the ladies in Queen 's Gate till I hear that he has changed his mind . "
231305	231319	231249	231250	the Member	6617	" I should . I do n't see what difference it would make . "
231328	231371	231321	231322	Captain Batsby	290	" It would make a difference , you know . If I were to say a word to Gertrude now,--as to being married or anything of that kind,--it would seem that I meant to go on whether I got anything or not . "
231372	231383	231385	231385	Traffick	321	" And you should seem to want to go on , "
231411	231425	231385	231385	Traffick	321	" But then I might find myself dropped in a hole at last . "
231426	231446	231321	231322	Captain Batsby	290	" My dear Batsby , you made that hole for yourself when you ran off with the young lady . "
231447	231454	231321	231322	Captain Batsby	290	" We settled all that before . "
231455	231514	231385	231385	Traffick	321	" Not quite . What we did settle was that we 'd do our best to fill the hole up . Of course you ought to go and see them . You went off with the young lady,--and since that have been accepted as her suitor by her father . You are bound to go and see her . "
231515	231521	231321	231322	Captain Batsby	290	" Do you think so ? "
231522	231596	231597	231598	The Captain	3130	" Certainly ! Certainly ! It never does to talk to Tringle about business at his own house . I 'll make an hour to see him in the City to - morrow . I 'm so pressed by business that I can hardly get away from the House after twelve;--but , I 'll do it . But , while I 'm in Lombard Street , do you go to Queen 's Gate . "
231809	231816	231818	231818	her	282	" Dear me ! Captain Batsby ! "
231835	231868	231818	231818	her	282	" Yes , Lady Tringle . As I have come back from abroad I thought that I might as well come and call . I did see Sir Thomas in the City . "
231869	231880	231818	231818	her	282	" Was not that a very foolish thing you did ? "
231881	231923	231818	231818	her	282	" Perhaps it was , Lady Tringle . Perhaps it would have been better to ask permission to address your daughter in the regular course of things . There was , perhaps,--perhaps a little romance in going off in that way . "
231924	231934	231818	231818	her	282	" It gave Sir Thomas a deal of trouble . "
231935	231958	231818	231818	her	282	" Well , yes ; he was so quick upon us you know . May I be allowed to see Gertrude now ? "
231959	231967	231969	231970	Lady Tringle	282	" Upon my word I hardly know , "
231974	231984	231969	231970	Lady Tringle	282	" I did see Sir Thomas in the City . "
231985	231997	231818	231818	her	282	" But did he say you were to come and call ? "
231998	232007	231818	231818	her	282	" He gave his consent to the marriage . "
232008	232020	232022	232023	Lady Tringle	282	" But I am afraid there was to be no money , "
232025	232038	232022	232023	Lady Tringle	282	" If money is no matter I suppose you may see her . "
232071	232074	232076	232076	Gertrude	404	" Benjamin , "
232078	232084	232076	232076	Gertrude	404	" is this really you ? "
232093	232097	232099	232099	Augusta	302	" My dear , "
232101	232107	232099	232099	Augusta	302	" do control your emotions . "
232108	232115	232117	232118	the mother	758	" Yes , indeed , Gertrude , "
232120	232142	232117	232118	the mother	758	" As the things are at present you should control yourself . Nobody as yet knows what may come of it . "
232143	232148	232151	232151	Gertrude	404	" Oh , Benjamin ! "
232174	232184	232151	232151	Gertrude	404	" Oh , Benjamin,--so you have come at last . "
232185	232195	232197	232197	Augusta	302	" I am afraid he has come too soon , "
232223	232228	232230	232230	Gertrude	404	" Why too soon ? "
232232	232263	232230	232230	Gertrude	404	" It can never be too soon . Oh , mamma , tell him that you make him welcome to your bosom as your second son - in - law . "
232264	232282	232305	232306	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , without consulting your father . "
232283	232289	232291	232291	Gertrude	404	" But papa has consented , "
232293	232297	232291	232291	Gertrude	404	" But only if-- "
232298	232303	232305	232306	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Oh , mamma , "
232308	232382	232305	232306	Mrs. Traffick	330	" do not talk about matters of business on such an occasion as this . All that must be managed between the gentlemen . If he is here as Gertrude 's acknowledged lover , and if papa has told him that he shall be accepted as such , I do n't think that we ought to say a word about money . I do hate money . It does make things so disagreeable . "
232383	232397	232399	232399	Gertrude	404	" Nobody can be more noble in everything of that kind than Benjamin , "
232401	232430	232399	232399	Gertrude	404	" It is only because he loves me with all his heart that he is here . Why else was it that he took me off to Ostend ? "
232689	232693	232694	232694	he	290	" Of course , "
232699	232704	232706	232706	Augusta	302	" Of course what ? "
232708	232716	232706	232706	Augusta	302	" It was because I loved her . "
232717	232725	232727	232727	Gertrude	404	" I knew that he loved me , "
232729	232749	232751	232751	Augusta	302	" And you are here , because you intend to make her your wife in presence of all men ? "
232753	232757	232751	232751	Augusta	302	" Oh certainly . "
232758	232769	232771	232772	Lady Tringle	282	" Then I suppose that it will be all right , "
232774	232781	232783	232783	Augusta	302	" It will be all right , "
232785	232801	232783	232783	Augusta	302	" And now , mamma , I think that we may leave them alone together . "
232849	232863	232865	232865	Augusta	302	" It is all the same thing , Benjamin , is it not ? "
232878	232882	232884	232885	the Captain	3130	" Oh quite , "
232935	232942	232944	232944	Augusta	302	" To tell you the truth , "
232946	232988	232944	232944	Augusta	302	" I did n't think that you would ever see him again . After what papa said to him in the City he might have got off and nobody could have said a word to him . Now he 's fixed . "
233136	233147	233148	233148	he	321	" I suppose I can go in to Sir Thomas , "
233241	233272	233233	233233	he	321	" Will you tell Sir Thomas that I must be down at the House almost immediately , and that I am particularly anxious to see him on business of importance ? "
233296	233304	233306	233307	Sir Thomas	271	" I am very sorry , Traffick , "
233309	233332	233306	233307	Sir Thomas	271	" but I really ca n't turn two Directors of the Bank of England out of my room , even for you . "
233333	233350	233233	233233	he	321	" I only thought I would just let you know that I am in a hurry . "
233351	233389	233306	233307	Sir Thomas	271	" So am I , for the matter of that . Have you gone to your father 's house to - day , so that you would not be able to see me in Queen 's Gate ? "
233427	233468	233412	233413	Sir Thomas	271	" No . My father is still at his house as yet , though they are thinking of going every day . It is about another matter , and I did not want to trouble you with it at home . "
233469	233477	233233	233233	he	321	" Let us hear what it is . "
233478	233486	233233	233233	he	321	" Captain Batsby has been with me . "
233487	233496	233233	233233	he	321	" Oh , he has , has he ? "
233497	233512	233233	233233	he	321	" I 've known him ever so long . He 's a foolish fellow . "
233513	233518	233233	233233	he	321	" So he seems . "
233519	233524	233233	233233	he	321	" But a gentleman . "
233525	233543	233233	233233	he	321	" Perhaps I am not so good a judge of that . His folly I did perceive . "
233544	233566	233233	233233	he	321	" Oh yes ; he 's a gentleman . You may take my word for that . And he has means . "
233567	233573	233233	233233	he	321	" That 's an advantage . "
233574	233595	233233	233233	he	321	" While that fellow Houston is hardly more than a beggar . And Batsby is quite in earnest about Gertrude . "
233596	233636	233233	233233	he	321	" If the two of them wish it he can have her to - morrow . She has made herself a conspicuous ass by running away with him , and perhaps it 's the best thing she can do . "
233637	233652	233233	233233	he	321	" That 's just it . Augusta sees it quite in the same light . "
233653	233666	233233	233233	he	321	" Augusta was never tempted . You would n't have run away . "
233667	233703	233233	233233	he	321	" It was n't necessary , Sir Thomas , was it ? There he is,--ready to marry her to - morrow . But , of course , he is a little anxious about the money . "
233704	233711	233233	233233	he	321	" I dare say he is . "
233712	233741	233233	233233	he	321	" I 've been talking to him,--and the upshot is , that I have promised to speak to you . He is n't at all a bad fellow . "
233742	233757	233233	233233	he	321	" He 'd keep a house over his wife 's head , you think ? "
233816	233830	233832	233832	Traffick	321	" He 'd do his duty by her as a man should do , "
233841	233849	233832	233832	Traffick	321	" Very well . There she is . "
233850	233863	233929	233930	Mr. Traffick	321	" But of course he would like to hear something about money . "
233864	233868	233929	233930	Mr. Traffick	321	" Would he ? "
233869	233875	233832	233832	Traffick	321	" That 's only natural . "
233876	233917	233929	233930	Mr. Traffick	321	" You found it so,--did you not ? What 's the good of giving a girl money when her husband wo n't spend it . Perhaps this Captain Batsby would expect to live at Queen 's Gate or Merle Park . "
233970	233982	233983	233983	he	321	" I am endeavouring to do my duty by the family , "
233986	233990	233983	233983	he	321	" Oh indeed . "
233991	234013	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Gertrude has eloped with this man , and the thing is talked about everywhere . Augusta feels it very much . "
234014	234021	233983	233983	he	321	" She does , does she ? "
234022	234034	233983	233983	he	321	" And I have thought it right to ask his intentions . "
234035	234049	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" He did n't knock you down , or anything of that sort ? "
234050	234055	233983	233983	he	321	" Knock me down ? "
234056	234112	233983	233983	he	321	" For interfering . But he has n't pluck for that . Houston would have done it immediately . And I should have said he was right . But if you have got anything to say , you had better say it . When you have done , then I shall have something to say . "
234113	234137	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" I 've told him that he could n't expect as much as you would have given her but for this running away . "
234138	234144	233983	233983	he	321	" You told him that ? "
234145	234168	233983	233983	he	321	" Yes ; I told him that . Then some sum had to be mentioned . He suggested a hundred thousand pounds . "
234169	234195	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" How very modest . Why should he have put up with less than you , seeing that he has got something of his own ? "
234196	234225	233983	233983	he	321	" He has n't my position , Sir . You know that well enough . Now to make a long and short of it , I suggested sixty . "
234226	234233	233983	233983	he	321	" Out of your own pocket ? "
234234	234238	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Not exactly . "
234239	234245	233983	233983	he	321	" But out of mine ? "
234246	234262	233983	233983	he	321	" You 're her father , and I suppose you intend to provide for her . "
234263	234326	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" And you have come here to dictate to me the provision which I am to make for my own child ! That is an amount of impudence which I did not expect even from you . But suppose that I agree to the terms . Will he , do you think , consent to have a clause put into the settlement ? "
234327	234331	233983	233983	he	321	" What clause ? "
234332	234366	233983	233983	he	321	" Something that shall bind him to keep a house for his own wife 's use , so that he should not take my money and then come and live upon me afterwards . "
234367	234371	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" Sir Thomas , "
234378	234397	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" that is a mode of expression so uncourteous that I can not bear it even from you . "
234398	234411	233983	233983	he	321	" Is there any mode of expression that you can not bear ? "
234412	234427	234373	234376	the Member of Parliament	4162	" If you want me to leave your house , say it at once . "
234428	234453	233983	233983	he	321	" Why I have been saying it for the last six months ! I have been saying it almost daily since you were married . "
234454	234471	233983	233983	he	321	" If so you should have spoken more clearly , for I have not understood you . "
234472	234477	234479	234480	Sir Thomas	271	" Heavens and earth , "
234482	234506	234479	234480	Sir Thomas	271	" Am I to understand that you wish your child to leave your roof during this inclement weather in her present delicate condition ? "
234507	234515	234517	234518	Sir Thomas	271	" Are you in a delicate condition ? "
234531	234553	233983	233983	he	321	" Because , if not , you , at any rate , had better go,--unless you find the weather too inclement . "
234554	234561	234563	234564	Mr. Traffick	321	" Of course I shall go , "
234566	234597	234563	234564	Mr. Traffick	321	" No consideration on earth shall induce me to eat another meal under your roof until you shall have thought good to have expressed regret for what you have said . "
234598	234614	233983	233983	he	321	" Then it is very long before I shall have to give you another meal . "
234615	234626	233983	233983	he	321	" And now what shall I say to Captain Batsby ? "
234627	234633	234635	234636	Sir Thomas	271	" Tell him from me , "
234638	234657	234635	234636	Sir Thomas	271	" that he can not possibly set about his work more injudiciously than by making you his ambassador . "
235077	235079	235111	235111	she	6683	" new "
235100	235103	235111	235111	she	6683	" old . "
235142	235193	235136	235136	she	6683	" Papa has altered his mind altogether . He speaks of you in the highest terms , and says that had you persevered he would have yielded about the money . Do try him again . When hearts have been united it is terrible that they should be dragged asunder . "
235209	235218	235194	235195	Mr. Traffick	321	" the thing had been talked about everywhere . "
235371	235374	235375	235375	he	344	" Already ! "
235379	235386	235375	235375	he	344	himself,--"gone off with another man already ? "
236058	236068	236069	236069	he	344	" She is old enough to look after herself , "
236239	236246	236247	236247	she	372	" Is this intended for banishment ? "
236263	236280	236247	236247	she	372	" What do you call banishment ? You used to like the country in the spring . "
236289	236306	236247	236247	she	372	" So I do , and in summer also . But I like nothing under constraint . "
236307	236326	236247	236247	she	372	" I am sorry that circumstances should make it imperative upon me to remain here just at present . "
236327	236338	236247	236247	she	372	" Why can not you tell the truth , Mudbury ? "
236339	236347	236247	236247	she	372	" Have I told you any falsehood ? "
236348	236371	236247	236247	she	372	" Why do you not say outright that I have been brought down here to be out of Frank Houston 's way ? "
236372	236395	236247	236247	she	372	" Because Frank Houston is a name which I do not wish to mention to you again,--at any rate for some time . "
236396	236409	236410	236410	she	6730	" What would you do if he were to show himself here ? "
236413	236482	236410	236410	she	6730	" Tell him at once that he was not welcome . In other words , I would not have him here . It is very improbable I should think that he would come without a direct invitation from me . That invitation he will never have until I feel satisfied that you and he have changed your mind again , and that you mean to stick to it . "
236483	236493	236247	236247	she	372	" I do not think we shall do that . "
236494	236522	236247	236247	she	372	" Then he shall not come down here ; nor , as far as I am able to arrange it , shall you go up to London . "
236523	236530	236410	236410	she	6730	" Then I am a prisoner ? "
236531	236540	236542	236543	her brother	1507	" You may put it as you please , "
236545	236591	236542	236543	her brother	1507	" I have no power of detaining you . Whatever influence I have I think it right to use . I am altogether opposed to this marriage , believing it to be an absurd infatuation . I think that he is of the same opinion . "
236592	236595	236597	236597	she	6731	" No ! "
236601	236610	236611	236611	he	1507	" That I believe to be his feeling , "
236621	236736	236611	236611	he	1507	" He is as perfectly aware as I am that you two are not adapted to live happily together on an income of a few hundreds a year . Some time ago it was agreed between you that it was so . You both were quite of one mind , and I was given to understand that the engagement was at an end . It was so much at an end that he made an arrangement for marrying another woman . But your feelings are stronger than his , and you allowed them to get the better of you . Then you enticed him back from the purpose on which you had both decided . "
236737	236740	236742	236742	she	6731	" Enticed ! "
236744	236752	236742	236742	she	6731	" I did nothing of the kind ! "
236753	236767	236611	236611	he	1507	" Would he have changed his mind if you had not enticed him ? "
236768	236785	236611	236611	he	1507	" I did nothing of the kind . I offered to remain just as we are . "
236786	236862	236611	236611	he	1507	" That is all very well . Of course he could not accept such an offer . Thinking as I do , it is my duty to keep you apart as long as I can . If you contrive to marry him in opposition to my efforts , the misery of both of you must be on your head . I tell you fairly that I do not believe he wishes anything of the kind . "
236863	236871	236873	236873	Imogene	372	" I am quite sure he does , "
236875	236947	236873	236873	Imogene	372	" Very well . Do you leave him alone ; stay down here , and see what will come of it . I quite agree that such a banishment , as you call it , is not a happy prospect for you;--but it is happier than that of a marriage with Frank Houston . Give that up , and then you can go back to London and begin the world again . "
237274	237289	237290	237290	she	372	" If I could only die , and there be an end of it ! "
237382	237389	237390	237390	she	372	" As for naming a day , "
237394	237431	237390	237390	she	372	" suppose we fix the first of January , ten years hence . Mudbury 's opposition will be worn out by old age , and you will have become thoroughly sick of the pleasures of London . "
237458	237480	237546	237546	she	372	" Do n't believe me if I say that I am not happy in knowing that I am altogether your own . "
237487	237489	237390	237390	she	372	" I "
237502	237505	237507	237507	she	372	" Cerberus , "
237521	237524	237546	237546	she	372	" enticed , "
237537	237545	237546	237546	she	372	" I have changed my mind again , "
238534	238537	238538	238538	Imogene	372	" prays . "
239227	239247	239220	239220	Battledore	599	" a deuced deal of cut - and - come - again in a hundred and twenty thousand pounds . "
239346	239348	239336	239336	Frank	344	" spotted "
239351	239354	239356	239356	himself	344	" run down "
239888	239896	239897	239897	he	344	" I call that an infernal interference , "
239909	239921	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" My dear Frank , you need not curse and swear , "
239927	239936	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" Infernal is not cursing nor yet swearing . "
239955	239961	239963	239963	Frank	282	" I call that abominable , "
239979	240015	239963	239963	Frank	282	" It is a beautiful letter;--just what I should have expected from Imogene . My dear , I will tell you what I propose . Remain as you are both of you for five years . "
240016	240025	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" Five years . That 's sheer nonsense . "
240026	240050	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" Five years , my dear , will run by like a dream . Five years to look back upon is as nothing . "
240051	240072	239963	239963	Frank	282	" But these five years are five years to be looked forward to . It is out of the question . "
240073	240087	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" But you say that you could not live as a married man . "
240088	240097	240099	240099	he	6821	" Live ! I suppose we could live . "
240110	240122	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" There would be seven hundred a - year I suppose . "
240123	240132	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" Could n't you do something , Frank ? "
240133	240166	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" What , to earn money ? No ; I do n't think I could . If I attempted to break stones I should n't break enough to pay for the hammers . "
240167	240175	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" Could n't you write a book ? "
240176	240231	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" That would be worse than the stones . I sometimes thought I could paint a picture,--but , if I did , nobody would buy it . As to making money that is hopeless . I could save some , by leaving off gloves and allowing myself only three clean shirts a - week . "
240232	240240	239923	239925	the old lady	5464	" That would be dreadful , Frank . "
240241	240265	240267	240267	he	6821	" It would be dreadful , but it is quite clear that I must do something . An effort has to be made . "
240347	240357	240359	240360	Aunt Rosina	533	" Perhaps I can do a little to help , "
240527	240535	240536	240536	she	603	" Do not be rash , Frank , "
240572	240585	240590	240590	Imogene	372	" As I live , there 's Frank coming through the gate . "
240798	240804	240789	240789	Frank	282	" What will Mudbury say ? "
240988	240995	240997	240997	he	6843	" I would n't bring anything , "
240999	241037	240997	240997	he	6843	" Mudbury would find it easier to maltreat my things than myself . It would look so foolish to tell the man with a fly to carry them back at once . Is he in the house ? "
241038	241045	241047	241048	Mrs. Docimer	373	" He is about the place , "
241053	241061	241047	241048	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Is he very fierce against me ? "
241062	241072	240997	240997	he	6843	" He thinks it had better be all over . "
241073	241100	240997	240997	he	6843	" I am of a different way of thinking , you see . I can not acknowledge that he has any right to dictate to Imogene . "
241101	241106	241108	241108	Imogene	372	" Nor can I , "
241110	241119	241108	241108	Imogene	372	" Of course he can turn me out . "
241120	241130	241132	241132	Imogene	372	" If he does I shall go with you , "
241134	241144	241146	241146	Frank	282	" We have made up our minds to it , "
241148	241179	241146	241146	Frank	282	" and he had better let us do as we please . He can make himself disagreeable , of course ; but he has got no power to prevent us . "
241236	241238	241231	241231	His	6848	" enticed "
241317	241333	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" Oh , Mudbury , who do you think has come ? He is here ! "
241334	241337	241555	241555	Docimer	373	" Houston ! "
241338	241344	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" Yes ; Frank Houston ! "
241345	241350	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" In the house ? "
241351	241372	241555	241555	Docimer	373	" He is in the house . But he has n't brought anything . He does n't mean to stay . "
241373	241389	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" What does that matter ? He shall not be asked even to dine here . "
241390	241437	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" If he is turned out she will go with him ! If she says so she will do it . You can not prevent her . That 's what would come of it if she were to insist on going up to London with him . "
241438	241444	241555	241555	Docimer	373	" He is a scoundrel ! "
241445	241471	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" No ; Mudbury;--not a scoundrel . You can not call him a scoundrel . There is something firm about him ; is n't there ? "
241472	241484	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" To come to my house when I told him not ? "
241485	241493	241555	241555	Docimer	373	" But he does really love her . "
241494	241497	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" Bother ! "
241498	241554	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" At any rate there they are in the breakfast - parlour , and something must be done . I could n't tell him not to come in . And she would n't have come without him . There will be enough for them to live upon . Do n't you think you 'd better ? "
241567	241575	241307	241308	the wife	3741	" did not think he 'd better . "
241615	241628	241630	241630	Docimer	373	" What I have got to say I would rather say outside , "
241632	241635	241637	241637	Frank	282	" Certainly , "
241639	241650	241637	241637	Frank	282	" I suppose I 'm to be allowed to return ? "
241651	241655	241656	241656	Imogene	372	" If he does not,"--said
241675	241697	241738	241738	he	1507	door,--"if he does not I shall go to him in Penzance . You will hardly attempt to keep me a prisoner . "
241698	241736	241738	241738	he	1507	" Who says that he is not to return ? I think that you are two idiots , but I am quite aware that I can not prevent you from being married if you are both determined . "
241752	241765	241766	241766	he	1507	" I can not understand that any man should be so fickle , "
241779	241788	241766	241766	he	1507	" Constant , I should suppose you mean . "
241789	241814	241738	241738	he	1507	" I said fickle , and I meant it . It was at your own suggestion that you and Imogene were to be separated . "
241815	241840	241738	241738	he	1507	" No doubt ; it was at my suggestion , and with her consent . But you see that we have changed our minds . "
241841	241848	241766	241766	he	1507	" And will change them again . "
241849	241936	241738	241738	he	1507	" We are steady enough in our purpose , now , at any rate . You hear what she says . If I came down here to persuade her to alter her purpose,--to talk her into doing something of which you disapproved , and as to which she agreed with you,--then you might do something by quarreling with me . But what 's the use of it , when she and I are of one mind ? You know that you can not talk her over . "
241937	241945	241738	241738	he	1507	" Where do you mean to live ? "
241946	241990	241766	241766	he	1507	" I 'll tell you all about that if you 'll allow me to send into Penzance for my things . I can not discuss matters with you if you proclaim yourself to be my enemy . You say we are both idiots . "
241991	241995	241738	241738	he	1507	" I do . "
241996	242029	241738	241738	he	1507	" Very well . Then you had better put up with two idiots . You ca n't cure their idiocy . Nor have you any authority to prevent them from exhibiting it . "
242126	242141	242143	242144	the brother	6865	" I can not imagine that you will endure to live with Aunt Rosina , "
242146	242157	242159	242159	Imogene	372	" Why on earth should I object to Aunt Rosina ? "
242161	242170	242159	242159	Imogene	372	" She and I have always been friends . "
242190	242203	242205	242205	Frank	282	" And we shall be able to have a small cottage somewhere , "
242207	242223	242205	242205	Frank	282	" She will keep the house in London , and we shall keep the cottage . "
242224	242235	242159	242159	Imogene	372	" And what on earth will you do with yourself ? "
242236	242244	242246	242246	Frank	282	" I have thought of that too , "
242248	242274	242246	242246	Frank	282	" I shall take to painting pictures in earnest;--portraits probably . I do n't see why I should n't do as well as anybody else . "
242275	242285	242287	242287	Imogene	372	" That head of yours of old Mrs. Jones , "
242289	242307	242287	242287	Imogene	372	" was a great deal better than dozens of things one sees every year in the Academy . "
242308	242311	242313	242313	Docimer	372	" Bother ! "
242315	242333	242335	242336	Mrs. Docimer	373	" I do n't see why he should not succeed , if he really will work hard , "
242338	242341	242335	242336	Mrs. Docimer	373	" Bother ! "
242342	242349	242351	242351	Frank	282	" Why should it be bother ? "
242358	242391	242355	242355	his	6867	" Ever so many fellows have begun and have got on , older than I am . And , even if I do n't earn anything , I 've got an employment . "
242392	242406	242408	242408	Docimer	373	" And is the painting - room to be in Green Street also ? "
242410	242425	242427	242427	Houston	282	" Just at present I shall begin by copying things at the National Gallery , "
242578	242605	242619	242621	Lord John Battledore	599	" Fancy after all that fellow Houston going and marrying such a girl as Imogene Docimer , without a single blessed shilling to keep themselves alive . "
242665	242681	242683	242683	Shuttlecock	598	" It 's the most infernal piece of folly I ever heard in my life , "
242685	242711	242683	242683	Shuttlecock	598	" There was that Tringle girl with two hundred thousand pounds to be had just for the taking;--Traffick 's wife 's sister , you know . "
242712	242720	242722	242722	another	3725	" There was something wrong about that , "
242724	242755	242722	242722	another	3725	" Benjamin Batsby , that stupid fellow who used to be in the twentieth , ran off with her just when everything had been settled between Houston and old Tringle . "
242756	242763	242765	242765	Battledore	599	" Not a bit of it , "
242767	242805	242765	242765	Battledore	599	" Tringle had quarrelled with Houston before that . Batsby did go with her , but the governor would n't come down with the money . Then the girl was brought back and there was no marriage . "
242851	242865	242867	242868	Lord John	599	" By George , he 's going to set up for painting portraits , "
242943	242957	242959	242960	Mrs. Traffick	330	" Here it is in the papers , Francis Houston and Imogene Docimer , "
242962	242972	242974	242974	Gertrude	404	" So she has really caught him at last ! "
242976	242984	242986	242987	Mrs. Traffick	330	" There was not much to catch , "
242989	243003	242986	242987	Mrs. Traffick	330	" I doubt whether they have got £ 500 a year between them . "
243004	243012	243014	243015	Lady Tringle	282	" It does seem so very sudden , "
243017	243020	243022	243022	Gertrude	404	" Sudden ! "
243024	243066	243022	243022	Gertrude	404	" They have been about it for the last five years . Of course he has tried to wriggle out of it all through . I am glad that she has succeeded at last , if only because he deserves it . "
243067	243080	243082	243082	Augusta	302	" I wonder where they 'll find a place to live in , "
243684	243702	243704	243705	his father	1095	" Tom , my boy , you have to go , you know , in four days , "
243755	243767	243768	243768	he	271	" What 's the good of telling a lie about it ? "
243775	243790	243768	243768	he	271	" What 's the good of manliness when a fellow would rather be drowned ? "
243989	243999	244001	244001	Tom	271	" I have n't ever said I would go , "
244003	244056	244001	244001	Tom	271	" But you must , you know . Everything has been packed up , and I want to make arrangements with you about money . I have got a cabin for you to yourself , and Captain Merry says that you will have a very pleasant passage . The equinoxes are over . "
244057	244066	244068	244068	Tom	271	" I do n't care about the equinoxes , "
244070	244082	244068	244068	Tom	271	" I should like bad weather if I am to go . "
244083	244095	244001	244001	Tom	271	" Perhaps you may have a touch of that , too . "
244096	244111	244113	244113	Tom	271	" If the ship could be dashed against a rock I should prefer it ! "
244115	244156	244113	244113	Tom	271	" That 's nonsense . The Cunard ships never are dashed against rocks . By the time you 've been three days at sea you 'll be as hungry as a hunter . Now , Tom , how about money ? "
244157	244165	244167	244167	Tom	271	" I do n't care about money , "
244169	244209	244167	244167	Tom	271	" Do n't you ? Then you 're very unlike anybody else that I meet . I think I had better give you power to draw at New York , San Francisco , Yokohama , Pekin , and Calcutta . "
244210	244218	244220	244220	Tom	271	" Am I to go to Pekin ? "
244226	244299	244220	244220	Tom	271	" Well , yes;--I think so . You had better see what the various houses are doing in China . And then from Calcutta you can go up the country . By that time I dare say we shall have possession of Cabul . With such a government as we have now , thank God ! the Russians will have been turned pretty nearly out of Asia by this time next year . "
244317	244328	244113	244113	Tom	271	" Am I to be away more than a year ? "
244329	244335	244337	244338	the father	757	" If I were you , "
244350	244384	244337	244338	the father	757	implied,--"if I were you I would do it thoroughly whilst I was about it . Had I seen so much when I was young I should have been a better man of business . "
244385	244394	244396	244396	Tom	271	" It 's all the same to me , "
244398	244429	244396	244396	Tom	271	" Say ten years , if you like it ! Say twenty ! I sha n't ever want to come back again . Where am I to go after Cabul ? "
244430	244473	244337	244338	the father	757	" I did n't exactly fix it that you should go to Cabul . Of course you will write home and give me your own opinion as you travel on . You will stay two or three months probably in the States . "
244474	244482	244483	244483	he	271	" Am I to go to Niagara ? "
244486	244510	244483	244483	he	271	" Of course you will , if you wish it . The Falls of Niagara , I am told , are very wonderful . "
244511	244520	244522	244522	Tom	271	" If a man is to drown himself , "
244524	244536	244522	244522	Tom	271	" it 's the sort of place to do it effectually . "
244537	244542	244544	244545	his father	1095	" Oh , Tom ! "
244547	244571	244544	244545	his father	1095	" Do you speak to me in that way when I am doing everything in my power to help you in your trouble ? "
244572	244579	244581	244581	Tom	271	" You can not help me , "
244583	244662	244581	244581	Tom	271	" Circumstances will . Time will do it . Employment will do it . A sense of your dignity as a man will do it , when you find yourself amongst others who know nothing of what you have suffered . You revel in your grief now because those around you know that you have failed . All that will be changed when you are with strangers . You should not talk to your father of drowning yourself ! "
244663	244674	244676	244676	Tom	271	" That was wrong . I know it was wrong , "
244680	244723	244676	244676	Tom	271	" I wo n't do it if I can help it,--but perhaps I had better not go there . And how long ought I to stay at Yokohama ? Perhaps you had better put it all down on a bit of paper . "
244869	244875	244877	244878	Sir Thomas	271	" I tell you what , "
244880	244916	244877	244878	Sir Thomas	271	" I 'll go down with you , see you on board the ship , and introduce you to Captain Merry . I shall be glad of an opportunity of paying a visit to Liverpool . "
245112	245198	245088	245088	He	271	follows:--"I start to - morrow afternoon,--I hardly know whither . It may be for years or it may be for ever . I should wish to say a word to Ayala before I go . Will she see me if I come at twelve o'clock exactly to - morrow morning ? I will call for an answer in half - an - hour . T. T. , junior . Of course I am aware that Ayala is to become the bride of Colonel Jonathan Stubbs . "
245213	245234	245205	245205	he	271	" Ayala will be glad to have an opportunity of saying good - bye to you to - morrow morning . "
245340	245352	245354	245355	her aunt	737	" I think you should see him as he asks it , "
245357	245368	245354	245355	her aunt	737	" Poor Tom ! Of course I will see him . "
245559	245562	245564	245564	Tom	271	" Ayala ! "
245566	245579	245564	245564	Tom	271	" So you are going away,--for a very long journey , Tom . "
245580	245609	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Yes , Ayala ; for a very long journey ; to Pekin and Cabul , if I live through , to get to those sort of places . "
245610	245620	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" I hope you will live through , Tom . "
245621	245654	245564	245564	Tom	271	" Thank you , Ayala . Thank you . I daresay I shall . They tell me I shall get over it . I do n't feel like getting over it now . "
245655	245668	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" You 'll find some beautiful young lady at Pekin , perhaps . "
245669	245718	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Beauty will never have any effect upon me again , Ayala . Beauty indeed ! Think what I have suffered from beauty ! From the first moment in which you came down to Glenbogie I have been a victim to it . It has destroyed me,--destroyed me ! "
245719	245730	245732	245732	Ayala	287	" I am sure you will come back quite well , "
245743	245786	245732	245732	Ayala	287	" Perhaps I may . If I can only get my heart to turn to stone , then I shall . I do n't know why I should have been made to care so much about it . Other people do n't . "
245787	245801	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" And now we must say , Good - bye , I suppose . "
245802	245835	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Oh , yes;--good - bye ! I did want to say one or two words if you ai n't in a hurry . Of course you 'll be his bride now . "
245836	245841	245843	245843	Ayala	287	" I hope so , "
245845	245858	245843	245843	Ayala	287	" I take that for granted . Of course I hate him . "
245859	245870	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Oh , Tom ; you sha n't say that . "
245871	245909	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" It 's human nature ! I can tell a lie if you want it . I 'd do anything for you . But you may tell him this : I 'm very sorry I struck him . "
245910	245924	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" He knows that , Tom . He has said so to me . "
245925	245938	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" He behaved well to me,--very well,--as he always does to everybody . "
245939	245960	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" Now , Tom , that is good of you . I do like you so much for saying that . "
245961	245967	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" But I hate him ! "
245968	245971	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" No ! "
245972	246016	245522	245523	Mrs. Dosett	285	" The evil spirits always hate the good ones . I am conscious of an evil spirit within my bosom . It is because my spirit is evil that you would not love me . He is good , and you love him . "
246017	246023	246025	246025	Ayala	287	" Yes ; I do , "
246027	246051	246025	246025	Ayala	287	" And now we will change the conversation . Ayala , I have got a little present which you must take from me . "
246052	246057	246059	246059	Ayala	287	" Oh , no ! "
246067	246079	246081	246081	he	6958	" It 's only a little thing,--and I hope you will . "
246104	246112	246091	246091	he	6958	" We are cousins , you know . "
246113	246120	246122	246122	Ayala	287	" Yes , we are cousins , "
246134	246152	246154	246154	Tom	271	" He must be very disdainful if he would object to such a little thing as this , "
246161	246210	246154	246154	Tom	271	" He is not at all disdainful . He will not object in the least . I am sure of that , Tom . I will take it then , and I will wear it sometimes as a memento that we have parted like friends,--as cousins should do . "
246211	246217	246219	246219	Tom	271	" Yes , as friends , "
246326	246331	246332	246332	he	271	" Good - bye , "
246335	246340	246332	246332	he	271	" good - bye , "
246440	246445	246447	246448	Lady Tringle	282	" Oh , Tom , "
246460	246469	246447	246448	Lady Tringle	282	" I do so hope you will recover . "
246470	246477	246479	246479	Augusta	302	" Of course he will recover , "
246481	246488	246490	246490	Gertrude	404	" Why should n't he recover ? "
246492	246531	246490	246490	Gertrude	404	" It 's all in a person 's mind . If he 'd only make up his mind not to think about her the thing would be done , and there would be nothing the matter with him . "
246532	246552	246554	246555	his mother	7356	" There are twenty others , ever so much better than Ayala , would have him to - morrow , "
246557	246565	246567	246567	Gertrude	404	" And be glad to catch him , "
246569	246589	246567	246567	Gertrude	404	" He 's not like one of those who have n't got anything to make a wife comfortable with . "
246590	246595	246597	246597	Augusta	302	" As for Ayala , "
246599	246643	246597	246597	Augusta	302	" she did n't deserve such good luck . I am told that that Colonel Stubbs ca n't afford to keep any kind of carriage for her . But then , to be sure , she has never been used to a carriage . "
246644	246653	246655	246656	his mother	7356	" Oh , Tom , do look up , "
246658	246669	246655	246656	his mother	7356	" and say that you will try to be happy . "
246670	246680	246682	246682	Gertrude	404	" He 'll be all right in New York , "
246684	246715	246682	246682	Gertrude	404	" There 's no place in the world , they say , where the girls put themselves forward so much , and make things so pleasant for the young men . "
246716	246725	246727	246727	Augusta	302	" He will soon find some one there , "
246729	246749	246727	246727	Augusta	302	" with a deal more to say for herself than Ayala , and a great deal better - looking . "
246750	246764	246766	246767	his mother	7356	" I hope he will find some one who will really love him , "
246835	246849	246850	246850	he	271	" I do n't believe that either of you know anything about it , "
246853	246861	246850	246850	he	271	" Do n't know anything about what ? "
246896	246907	246909	246909	Gertrude	404	" Why do n't we know as well as you ? "
246918	246932	246934	246934	Tom	271	" I do n't believe you do know anything about it;--that 's all , "
246936	246964	246934	246934	Tom	271	" And now there 's the cab . Good - bye , mother ! Good - bye , Augusta . I hope you 'll be all right . "
246971	246989	246934	246934	Tom	271	" Good - bye , Gertrude . I hope you 'll get all right too some day . "
247037	247044	247046	247047	his father	1095	" Upon my word , Tom , "
247056	247073	247046	247047	his father	1095	" I wish I were going to New York myself with you;--it all looks so comfortable . "
247074	247077	247079	247079	Tom	271	" Yes , "
247081	247087	247079	247079	Tom	271	" it 's very nice . "
247088	247115	247116	247116	Tom	271	" You 'll enjoy yourself amazingly . There is that Mrs. Thompson has two as pretty daughters with her as ever a man wished to see . "
247121	247156	247116	247116	Tom	271	" And you 're fond of smoking . Did you see the smoking - room ? They 've got everything on board these ships now . Upon my word I envy you the voyage . "
247157	247169	247171	247171	Tom	271	" It 's as good as anything else , I daresay , "
247173	247181	247171	247171	Tom	271	" Perhaps it 's better than London . "
247201	247213	247183	247192	his father , who had been speaking aloud to him	6991	" Shake yourself , Tom;--shake yourself , and get over it . "
247214	247219	247221	247221	Tom	271	" I am trying , "
247223	247321	247221	247221	Tom	271	" Love is a very good thing , Tom , when a man can enjoy it , and make himself warm with it , and protect himself by it from selfishness and hardness of heart . But when it knocks a man 's courage out of him , and makes him unfit for work , and leaves him to bemoan himself , there 's nothing good in it . It 's as bad as drink . Do n't you know that I am doing the best I can for you , to make a man of you ? "
247322	247327	247367	247367	his	271	" I suppose so . "
247328	247361	247221	247221	Tom	271	" Then shake yourself , as I call it . It is to be done , if you set about it in earnest . Now , God bless you , my boy . "
247784	247789	247790	247790	he	271	" The truth is , "
247799	247824	247790	247790	he	271	" that , though it was arranged I should remain there till after my wife 's confinement , I could not bear his language . "
247876	247881	247883	247884	the Member	6617	" Oh , yes , "
247898	247958	247883	247884	the Member	6617	" I spoke to him , and told him my mind very freely . When I say I 'll do a thing , I always do it . And as for Tringle , nobody knows him better than I. It does not do to be afraid of him . There is a little bit of the cur about him . "
247959	247965	247883	247884	the Member	6617	" What did he say ? "
247966	247988	247883	247884	the Member	6617	" He did n't like it . The truth is-- . You know I do n't mind speaking to you openly . "
247989	247994	247996	247996	Batsby	290	" Oh , no , "
247998	248019	247996	247996	Batsby	290	" He thinks he ought to do as well with the second girl as he has done with the first . "
248092	248120	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" He is proud of his connection with our family , and looks perhaps even more than he ought to do to a seat in the House . "
248121	248133	248135	248135	Batsby	290	" I could get in myself if I cared for it , "
248137	248178	248135	248135	Batsby	290	" Very likely . It is more difficult than ever to find a seat just now . A family connection of course does help one . I had to trust to that a good deal before I was known myself . "
248179	248187	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" But what did Sir Thomas say ? "
248188	248254	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" He made himself uncommonly disagreeable;--I can tell you that . He could n't very well abuse me , but he was n't very particular in what he said about you . Of course he was cut up about the elopement . We all felt it . Augusta was very much hurt . In her precarious state it was so likely to do a mischief . "
248255	248263	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" It ca n't be undone now . "
248264	248358	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" No;--it ca n't be undone . But it makes one feel that you ca n't make a demand for money as though you set about it in the other way . When I made up my mind to marry I stated what I thought I had a right to demand , and I got it . He knew very well that I should n't take a shilling less . It does make a difference when he knows very well that you 've got to marry the girl whether with or without money . "
248359	248371	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" I have n't got to marry the girl at all . "
248372	248406	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" Have n't you ? I rather think you have , old fellow . It is generally considered that when a gentleman has gone off with a girl he means to marry her . "
248407	248420	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" Not if the father comes after her and brings her back . "
248421	248442	248059	248062	a Member of Parliament	2031	" And when he has gone afterwards to the family house and proposed himself again in the mother 's presence . "
248464	248517	248461	248462	his wife	672	" Of course you must marry her . Sir Thomas knows that , and , knowing it , why should he be flush with his money ? I never allowed myself to say a single word they could use against me till the ready - money - down had been all settled . "
248518	248526	248527	248527	Batsby	290	" What was it he did say ? "
248558	248639	248461	248462	his wife	672	" He said that he would not consider the question of money at all till the marriage had been solemnised . Of course he stands on his right . Why should n't he ? But , rough as he is , he is n't stingy . Give him his due . He is n't stingy . The money 's there all right ; and the girl is his own child . You 'll have to wait his time;--that 's all . "
248640	248648	248718	248719	Mr. Traffick	321	" And have nothing to begin with ? "
248649	248675	248461	248462	his wife	672	" That 'll be about it , I think . But what does it matter , Batsby ? You are always talking about your income . "
248676	248707	248461	248462	his wife	672	" No , I ai nt ; not half so much as you do of your seat in Parliament,--which everybody says you are likely to lose at the next election . "
249073	249104	249105	249105	He	321	" Dearest Ben,--Mamma wants you to come and lunch to - morrow . Papa has taken poor Tom down to Liverpool , and wo n't be back till dinner - time.--G. "
249163	249177	249205	249205	their	7045	" Come and walk at three o'clock in Kensington Gardens to - morrow . "
249264	249267	249268	249268	she	3655	" Ben , "
249276	249288	249268	249268	she	3655	" why did you not come for me to the house ? "
249289	249298	249272	249272	she	3655	" I thought you would like it best . "
249299	249338	249340	249340	he	321	" Why should I like it best ? Of course mamma knows all about it . Augusta would have come with me just to see me here , only that she can not walk out just at present . "
249423	249426	249427	249427	she	3655	" Ben , "
249430	249446	249427	249427	she	3655	" I was so happy to hear what you said to mamma the other day . "
249447	249453	249427	249427	she	3655	" What did I say ? "
249454	249478	249427	249427	she	3655	" Why , of course , that , as papa has given his consent , our engagement is to go on just as if-- "
249479	249485	249427	249427	she	3655	" Just as if what ? "
249486	249497	249427	249427	she	3655	" As if we had found the clergyman at Ostend . "
249498	249511	249513	249513	Batsby	517	" If we had done that we should have been married now , "
249515	249529	249513	249513	Batsby	517	" Exactly . And it 's almost as good as being married;--isn't it ? "
249530	249540	249427	249427	she	3655	" I suppose it comes to the same thing . "
249541	249556	249427	249427	she	3655	" Had n't you better go to papa again and have it all finished ? "
249557	249565	249513	249513	Batsby	517	" He makes himself so very unpleasant . "
249566	249630	249427	249427	she	3655	" That 's only because he wants to punish us for running away . I suppose it was wrong . I shall never be sorry , because it made me know how very , very much you loved me . Did n't it make you feel how very , very dearly I loved you,--to trust myself all alone with you in that way ? "
249631	249639	249427	249427	she	3655	" Oh , yes ; of course . "
249640	249676	249513	249513	Batsby	517	" And papa ca n't bite you , you know . You go to him , and tell him that you hope to be received in the house as my,--my future husband , you know . "
249677	249684	249427	249427	she	3655	" Shall I say nothing else ? "
249685	249692	249427	249427	she	3655	" You mean about the day ? "
249693	249700	249427	249427	she	3655	" I was meaning about money . "
249701	249739	249427	249427	she	3655	" I do n't think I would . He is very generous , but he does not like to be asked . When Augusta was to be married he arranged all that himself after they were engaged . "
249740	249748	249427	249427	she	3655	" But Traffick demanded a certain sum ? "
249773	249824	249760	249761	Mr. Traffick	321	" Not at all . Septimus knew nothing about it till after the engagement . He was only too glad to get papa 's consent . You must n't believe all that Septimus says , you know . You may be sure of this,--that you can trust papa 's generosity . "
249870	249876	249878	249879	Sir Thomas	271	" How are you again ? "
249896	249910	249882	249883	the Captain	3130	" Have you had another trip to the continent since I saw you ? "
249945	249971	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" No , Sir Thomas ; I have n't been abroad since then . I do n't keep on going abroad constantly in that way . "
249972	249982	249882	249883	the Captain	3130	" And what can I do for you now ? "
249983	250003	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" Of course it 's about your daughter . I want to have your permission to consider ourselves engaged . "
250004	250028	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" I explained to you before that if you and Gertrude choose to marry each other I shall not stand in your way . "
250029	250035	249882	249883	the Captain	3130	" Thank you , Sir . "
250036	250094	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" I do n't know that it is much to thank me for . Only that she made a fool of herself by running away with you I should have preferred to wait till some more sensible candidate had proposed himself for her hand . I do n't suppose you 'll ever set the Thames on fire . "
250095	250104	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" I did very well in the army . "
250105	250168	249882	249883	the Captain	3130	" It 's a pity you did not remain there , and then , perhaps , you would not have gone to Ostend with my daughter . As it is , there she is . I think she might have done better with herself ; but that is her fault . She has made her bed and she must lie upon it . "
250169	250190	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" If we are to be married I hope you wo n't go on abusing me always , Sir Thomas . "
250191	250234	250236	250236	he	7059	" That 's as you behave . You did n't suppose that I should allow such a piece of tomfoolery as that to be passed over without saying anything about it ! If you marry her and behave well to her I will-- "
250239	250248	250236	250236	he	7059	" What will you do , Sir Thomas ? "
250249	250262	249926	249927	Mr. Traffick	321	" I 'll say as little as possible about the Ostend journey . "
250263	250272	250236	250236	he	7059	" And as to money , Sir Thomas ? "
250273	250358	250236	250236	he	7059	" I think I have promised quite enough for you . You are not in a position , Captain Batsby , to ask me as to money;--nor is she . You shall marry her without a shilling,--or you shall not marry her at all . Which is it to be ? I must have an end put to all this . I wo n't have you hanging about my house unless I know the reason why . Are you two engaged to each other ? "
250359	250365	250367	250367	Batsby	290	" I suppose we are , "
250371	250377	250367	250367	Batsby	290	" Suppose is not enough . "
250378	250382	250384	250384	Batsby	290	" We are , "
250388	250509	250384	250384	Batsby	290	" Very well . Then , from this moment , Ostend shall be as though there were n't such a seaport anywhere in Europe . I will never allude to the place again,--unless , perhaps , you should come and stay with me too long when I am particularly anxious to get rid of you . Now you had better go and settle about the time and all that with Lady Tringle , and tell her that you mean to come and dine to - morrow or next day , or whenever it suits . Come and dine as often as you please , only do not bring your wife to live with me pertinaciously when you 're not asked . "
250558	250567	250569	250570	Sir Thomas	271	" He 's a better fellow than Traffick , "
250578	250594	250569	250570	Sir Thomas	271	" and as he has trusted me so far I 'll not throw him over . "
250638	250650	250659	250659	she	282	" My dear , dearest Benjamin , I am so happy , "
250672	250682	250659	250659	she	282	" You will always be so dear to me ! "
250781	250786	250788	250788	Augusta	302	" My dear Benjamin , "
250790	250859	250788	250788	Augusta	302	" we shall always be so happy to entertain you as a brother . Mr. Traffick has a great regard for you , and said from the first that if you behaved as you ought to do after that little journey he would arrange that everything should go straight between you and papa . I was quite sure that you would come forward at once as a man . "
250881	250888	250889	250889	she	404	" When I think of it , "
250894	250922	250889	250889	she	404	" I do n't know how I should ever have looked anybody in the face again,--after our going away with our things mixed up in that way . "
250923	250937	250788	250788	Augusta	302	" I am glad rather now that we did n't find the clergyman . "
250938	250943	250945	250945	Gertrude	404	" Oh , certainly , "
250947	250978	250945	250945	Gertrude	404	" I do n't suppose anybody would have given me anything . Now there 'll be a regular wedding , and , of course , there will be the presents . "
250979	250996	250788	250788	Augusta	302	" And , though nothing is to be settled , I suppose he will do something . "
250997	251012	251014	251014	Gertrude	404	" And it would have been very dreadful , not having a regular trousseau , "
251016	251078	251014	251014	Gertrude	404	" Mamma will , of course , do now just as she did about Augusta . He allowed her £ 300 ! Only think;--if we had been married at Ostend you would have had to buy things for me before the first month was out . I had n't more than half - a - dozen pair of stockings with me . "
251079	251096	251098	251099	the Captain	3130	" He ca n't but say now that we have done as he would have us , "
251101	251123	251098	251099	the Captain	3130	" I do suppose that he will not be so unnatural as not to give something when Augusta had £ 200,000 . "
251124	251151	251014	251014	Gertrude	404	" Indeed , she had not . But you 'll see that sooner or later papa will do for me quite as well as for Augusta . "
251284	251287	251289	251289	he	271	" buckled , "
251561	251567	251569	251569	Gertrude	404	" What does that signify ? "
251571	251592	251569	251569	Gertrude	404	" If you say nothing to her about it , I 'll be bound she 'll say nothing to you . "
251647	251653	251655	251655	he	290	" There , my boy , "
251657	251689	251655	251655	he	290	" though you and Gertrude did take a little journey on the sly to a place which we will not mention , you sha n't take her altogether empty - handed . "
251768	251782	251784	251785	Mrs. Traffick	330	" No doubt I had twice as much as the two put together , "
251793	251807	251784	251785	Mrs. Traffick	330	" but then of course Lord Boardotrade 's rank would make people give . "
251894	251909	251910	251910	she	330	" No ; I do n't want to run away from him any more , "
251916	251955	251910	251910	she	330	" I want to be with him always , and I hope he wo n't run away from me . But I 've got to be somewhere where I can think about it all for a little time . "
251956	251965	251910	251910	she	330	" Ca n't you think about it here ? "
251966	252027	251910	251910	she	330	" No;--one can never think about a thing where it has all taken place . I must be up in my own little room in Kingsbury Crescent , and must have Aunt Margaret 's work around me,--so that I may realise what is going to come . Not but what I mean to do a great deal of work always . "
252028	252033	251910	251910	she	330	" Mend his stockings ? "
252034	252095	251910	251910	she	330	" Yes,--if he wears stockings . I know he does n't . He always wears socks . He told me so . Whatever he has , I 'll mend,--or make if he wants me . ' I can bake and I can brew , And I can make an Irish stew;-- Wash a shirt , and iron it too . ' "
252111	252120	252105	252105	she	7088	" Where did you get all your poetry ? "
252121	252193	251910	251910	she	330	" He taught me that . We are not going to be fine people,--except sometimes when we may be invited to Stalham . But I must go on Thursday , Lady Albury . I came for a week , and I have been here ever since the middle of February . It seems years since the old woman told me I was perverse , and he said that she was right . "
252194	252205	251910	251910	she	330	" Think how much you have done since that time . "
252206	252218	252105	252105	she	7088	" Yes , indeed . I very nearly destroyed myself;--didn't I ? "
252219	252224	251910	251910	she	330	" Not very nearly . "
252225	252280	251910	251910	she	330	" I thought I had . It was only when you showed me his letter on that Sunday morning that I began to have any hopes . I wonder what Mr. Greene preached about that morning . I did n't hear a word . I kept on repeating what he said in the postscript . "
252281	252287	252105	252105	she	7088	" Was there a postscript ? "
252288	252299	251910	251910	she	330	" Of course there was . Do n't you remember ? "
252300	252307	251910	251910	she	330	" No , indeed ; not I. "
252308	252384	252105	252105	she	7088	" The letter would have been nothing without the postscript . He said that Croppy was to come back for me . I knew he would n't say that unless he meant to be good to me . And yet I was n't quite sure of it . I know it now ; do n't I ? But I must go , Lady Albury . I ought to let Aunt Margaret know all about it . "
252475	252492	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" My own darling Lucy will be away at that time with her own young man , "
252505	252516	252518	252518	her	7089	" And so you 've taken Colonel Stubbs at last , "
252522	252536	252518	252518	her	7089	" He has taken me , aunt . I did n't take him . "
252537	252546	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" But you refused him ever so often . "
252547	252559	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" Well;--yes . I do n't think I quite refused him . "
252560	252566	252518	252518	her	7089	" I thought you did . "
252567	252595	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" It was a dreadful muddle , Aunt Margaret;--but it has come right at last , and we had better not talk about that part of it . "
252596	252607	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" I was so sure you did n't like him . "
252608	252629	252518	252518	her	7089	" Not like him ? I always liked him better than anybody else in the world that I ever saw . "
252630	252634	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" Dear me ! "
252635	252693	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" Of course I should n't say so if it had n't come right at last . I may say whatever I please about it now , and I declare that I always loved him . A girl can be such a fool ! I was , I know . I hope you are glad , aunt . "
252694	252736	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" Of course I am . I am glad of anything that makes you happy . It seemed such a pity that , when so many gentlemen were falling in love with you all round , you could n't like anybody . "
252737	252755	252494	252494	Ayala	287	" But I did like somebody , Aunt Margaret . And I did like the best,--didn't I ? "
252796	252801	252802	252802	he	734	" My dear girl , "
252805	252845	252802	252802	he	734	" I am rejoiced indeed that you should have before you such a prospect of happiness . I always felt how sad for you was your residence here , with two such homely persons as your aunt and myself . "
252846	252855	252857	252857	Ayala,--perhaps	617	" I have always been happy with you , "
252870	252875	252876	252876	she	617	" And I know , "
252879	252895	252876	252876	she	617	" how much Lucy and I have always owed you since poor papa 's death . "
252896	252935	252802	252802	he	734	" Nevertheless , it has been dull for a young girl like you . Now you will have your own duties , and if you endeavour to do them properly the world will never be dull to you . "
252947	252956	252958	252959	her uncle	734	" We have no feeling , my dear , "
252961	253012	252958	252959	her uncle	734	" except to do the best we can for you . We should have been glad to see you married from here if that had suited . But , as this lover of yours has grand friends of his own , I dare say their place may be the better . "
253277	253280	253247	253247	Ayala	287	" He 's "
253307	253309	253405	253405	Ayala	287	" He "
253318	253323	253325	253325	Lucy	266	" It was bad , "
253327	253344	253325	253325	Lucy	266	" when Uncle Tom told him to sell those magnificent conceptions of his brain by auction ! "
253345	253353	253355	253355	Ayala	287	" I did feel for him certainly , "
253357	253398	253355	253355	Ayala	287	" And then when he was constrained to say that he would take me at once without any preparation because Aunt Emmeline wanted me to go , I do n't suppose any man ever behaved more beautifully than he did . "
253399	253403	253405	253405	Ayala	287	" Yes indeed , "
253453	253458	253459	253459	she	266	" Oh , Lucy , "
253462	253504	253459	253459	she	266	" I was so miserable when he went away after that walk in the wood . I thought he never would come back again when I had behaved so badly . But he did . Was not that grand in him ? "
253505	253515	253440	253440	she	266	" I suppose he was very fond of you . "
253516	253557	253440	253440	she	266	" I hope he was . I hope he is . But what should I have done if he had not come back ? No other man would have come back after that . You never behaved unkindly to Isadore ? "
253558	253570	253572	253572	Lucy	266	" I think he would have come back a thousand times , "
253574	253606	253572	253572	Lucy	266	" only I can not imagine that I should ever have given him the necessity of coming back even a second . But then I had known him so much longer . "
253607	253620	253622	253622	Ayala	287	" It was n't that I had n't known him long enough , "
253624	253678	253622	253622	Ayala	287	" I seemed to know all about him almost all at once . I knew how good he was , and how grand he was , long before I had left the Marchesa up in London . But I think it astounded me that such a one as he should care for me . "
253710	253712	253622	253622	Ayala	287	" him "
253910	253922	253923	253923	he	1169	" Never mind what she 'll be able to do afterwards , "
253953	254002	254019	254019	his	1169	" She wo n't be the worse for having a dozen new petticoats in her trunk , and , if she do n't want to blow her nose with as many handkerchiefs this year as Gertrude does , she 'll be able to keep them for next year . "
254074	254078	254063	254063	she	266	" Dear Ayala , "
254157	254165	254166	254166	she	7129	" You must go and see him , "
254182	254212	254174	254174	he	385	" Only for him I should n't have any clothes to speak of at all , and I should have to be married in my old brown morning frock . "
254213	254227	254229	254230	the Colonel	2361	" It would be just as good as any other for my purpose , "
254232	254310	254229	254230	the Colonel	2361	" But it would n't for mine , Sir . Fine feathers make fine birds , and I mean to be as fine as Lady Albury 's big peacock . So if you please you 'll go to Queen 's Gate , and Lombard Street too , and show yourself . Oh , Jonathan , I shall be so proud that everybody who knows me should see what sort of a man has chosen to love me . "
254531	254541	254543	254544	the Colonel	2361	" You do n't come and call on me , "
254546	254568	254543	254544	the Colonel	2361	" What!--all the way down to Aldershot ? I should like , but I do n't quite dare to do that . "
254717	254720	254724	254724	herself	618	" Yes , "
254732	254750	254727	254727	she	266	" he is very good looking , but nobody would take him for an Angel of Light . "
254751	254762	254764	254764	Lucy	266	" Ayala has come to see you at your work , "
254772	254791	254764	254764	Lucy	266	" I am delighted to see her . Do you remember where we last met , Miss Dormer ? "
254792	254798	254800	254800	Ayala	287	" Miss Dormer , indeed , "
254802	254838	254800	254800	Ayala	287	" I am not going to call you Mr. Hamel . Yes ; it was high up among the seats of the Coliseum . There has a great deal happened to us all since then . "
254839	254848	254764	254764	Lucy	266	" And I remember you at the bijou . "
254849	254866	254868	254868	Ayala	287	" I should think so . I knew then so well what was going to happen , "
254870	254876	254868	254868	Ayala	287	" What did you know ? "
254877	254891	254764	254764	Lucy	266	" That you and Lucy were to fall in love with each other . "
254892	254902	254904	254904	he	7148	" I had done my part of it already , "
254906	254912	254914	254914	Lucy	266	" Hardly that , Isadore , "
254916	254932	254914	254914	Lucy	266	" or you would not have passed me in Kensington Gardens without speaking to me . "
254933	254951	254764	254764	Lucy	266	" But I did speak to you . It was then I learned where to find you . "
254952	254981	254982	254982	Ayala	287	" That was the second time . If I had remained away , as I ought to have done , I suppose you never would have found me . "
255013	255020	255022	255022	Lucy	266	" It was cruel,--was it not ? "
255024	255033	255035	255035	Ayala	287	" He never saw them , you know , "
255046	255051	255053	255054	the sculptor	1149	" If he had , "
255056	255088	255053	255054	the sculptor	1149	" he would have doubted the auctioneer 's getting anything . I have turned it all in my mind very often since , and I think that Sir Thomas was right . "
255089	255097	255099	255099	Lucy	266	" I am sure he was wrong , "
255101	255132	255099	255099	Lucy	266	" He is very goodnatured , and nobody can be more grateful to another person than I am to him;--but I wo n't agree that he was right about that . "
255133	255146	255149	255149	Ayala	287	" He never would have said it if he had seen them , "
255151	255161	255163	255164	the sculptor	1149	" They will never fetch anything as they are , "
255166	255203	255163	255164	the sculptor	1149	" and I do n't suppose that when I made them I thought they would . They have served their purpose , and I sometimes feel inclined to break them up and have them carted away . "
255204	255207	255209	255209	Lucy	266	" Isadore ! "
255211	255216	255218	255218	Ayala	287	" For what purpose ? "
255220	255255	255218	255218	Ayala	287	" They were the lessons which I had to teach myself , and the play which I gave to my imagination . Who wants a great figure of Beelzebub like that in his house ? "
255256	255262	255264	255264	Ayala	287	" I call it magnificent , "
255266	255273	255275	255275	Lucy	266	" His name is Lucifer,--not Beelzebub , "
255277	255289	255275	255275	Lucy	266	" You call him Beelzebub merely to make little of him . "
255290	255383	255218	255218	Ayala	287	" It is difficult to do that , because he is nearly ten feet high . And who wants a figure of Bacchus ? The thing is , whether , having done a figure of Bacchus , I may not be better able to do a likeness of Mr. Jones , when he comes to sit for his bust at the request of his admiring friends . For any further purpose that it will answer , Bacchus might just as well be broken up and carted away in the dust - cart . "
255434	255441	255443	255443	Hamel	310	" I shall be quite content , "
255445	255481	255443	255443	Hamel	310	" if the whole family of the Jones 's will have their busts done about the size of life , and stand them up over their bookshelves . My period for Beelzebubs has gone by . "
255739	255749	255751	255752	Lord John	599	" Somebody had to bottle - hold for him , "
255761	255787	255789	255790	his Lordship	2067	" and I did n't like to throw the fellow over , though he is such a fool ! And there was Stubbs , too , "
255792	255831	255789	255790	his Lordship	2067	" going to take the other girl without a shilling ! There 's Stubbs , and Houston , and Batsby , all gone and drowned themselves . It 's just the same as though they 'd drowned themselves ! "
256537	256541	256543	256544	Lady Albury	413	" My dear , "
256546	256577	256578	256578	Ayala	287	" it is important , you know . I dare say you can bake and brew , because you say so ; but you do n't know anything about clothes . "
256599	256619	256592	256592	her	287	" Jonathan did not like her things as she chose to have them he might do the other thing . "
256726	256745	256752	256752	she	6380	" I told you there would be a many new dresses before two years were over , Miss , "
256927	256950	256952	256952	Ayala	287	" I do n't see why he is to be sent away after dinner to walk across the park in the dark , "
256965	256974	256976	256977	Lady Albury	413	" It is a law , my dear , "
256979	257031	256976	256977	Lady Albury	413	" and has to be obeyed whether you understand it or not , like other laws . Mr. Greene will be with him , so that no one shall run away with him in the dark . Then he will be able to go into church without dirtying his dress boots . "
257032	257048	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" But I thought there would be half - a - dozen carriages at least . "
257049	257094	256976	256977	Lady Albury	413	" But there wo n't be room in one of them for him . He is to be nobody until he comes forth from the church as your husband . Then he is to be everybody . That is the very theory of marriage . "
257101	257113	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" I think we managed it all very well between us , "
257119	257131	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" but you really can not guess the trouble we took . "
257132	257140	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" Why should there have been trouble ? "
257141	257197	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" Because you were such a perverse creature , as the old lady said . I am not sure that you were not right , because a girl does so often raise herself in her lover 's estimation by refusing him half - a - dozen times . But you were not up to that . "
257198	257218	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" Indeed I was not . I am sure I did not intend to give any trouble to anybody . "
257219	257267	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" But you did . Only think of my going up to London to meet him , and of him coming from Aldershot to meet me , simply that we might put our heads together how to overcome the perversity of such a young woman as you ! "
257281	257307	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" But I do believe it was for the best . In this way he came to understand how absolutely necessary you were to him . "
257308	257315	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" Am I necessary to him ? "
257316	257321	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" He thinks so . "
257322	257356	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" Oh , if I can only be necessary to him always ! But there should have been no going up to London . I should have rushed into his arms at once . "
257357	257364	257115	257116	Lady Albury	413	" That would have been unusual . "
257365	257372	257374	257374	Ayala	287	" But so is he unusual , "
257543	257548	257549	257549	she	902	" Oh , yes , "
257552	257600	257549	257549	she	902	" of course we will go to the old wood . Where else ? I am so glad that poor fox went through Gobblegoose;--otherwise we should never have gone there , and then who knows whether you and I would ever have been friends again any more ? "
257601	257618	257778	257778	Ayala	287	" If one wood had n't been there , I think another would have been found . "
257619	257645	257549	257549	she	902	" Ah , that 's just it . You can know that you had a purpose , and perhaps were determined to carry it out . "
257646	257651	257549	257549	she	902	" Well , rather . "
257652	257747	257778	257778	Ayala	287	" But I could n't be sure of that . I could n't carry out my purpose , even if I had one . I had to doubt , and to be unhappy , and to hate myself , because I had been perverse . I declare , I do think you men have so much the best of it . How glorious would it have been to be able to walk straight up and say , Jonathan Stubbs , I love you better than all the world . Will you be my husband ? "
257748	257769	257549	257549	she	902	" But suppose the Jonathan Stubbs of the occasion were to decline the honour . Where would you be then ? "
257770	257776	257778	257778	Ayala	287	" That would be disagreeable , "
257780	257791	257778	257778	Ayala	287	" It is disagreeable,--as you made me feel twice over . "
257792	257802	257549	257549	she	902	" Oh , Jonathan , I am so sorry . "
257803	257817	257549	257549	she	902	" Therefore it is possible that you may have the best of it . "
257824	257837	257838	257838	she	287	" And so you never will take another walk with Ayala Dormer ? "
257847	257851	257852	257852	he	7243	" Never another , "
257855	257948	257852	257852	he	7243	" You can not think how I regret it . Of course I am glad to become your wife . I do not at all want to have it postponed . But there is something so sweet in having a lover;--and you know that though I shall have a husband I shall never have a lover again,--and I never had one before , Jonathan . There has been very little of it . When a thing has been so sweet it is sad to think that it must be gone for ever ! "
258010	258033	258006	258006	her	287	" Ah me ! I wonder whether you 'll like me to lean upon you when a dozen years have gone by . "
258034	258044	257976	257976	he	7243	" That depends on how heavy you may be . "
258045	258076	258135	258135	he	7245	" I shall be a fat old woman , perhaps . But I shall lean upon you,--always , always . What else shall I ever have to lean upon now ? "
258077	258084	258006	258006	her	287	" What else should you want ? "
258085	258133	258135	258135	he	7245	" Nothing,--nothing,--nothing ! I want nothing else . I wonder whether there is anybody in all the world who has got so completely everything that she ever dreamed of wanting as I have . But if you could have been only my lover for a little longer-- ! "
258226	258234	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" What a happy fellow you are ! "
258255	258266	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" Why do n't you get a wife for yourself ? "
258267	258277	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" Yes ; with £ 120 a - year ! "
258278	258286	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" With a little money you might . "
258287	258323	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" I do n't want to have to look for the money ; and if I did I should n't get it . I often think how very unfairly things are divided in this world . "
258324	258335	258236	258237	Mr. Greene	564	" That will all be made up in the next . "
258336	258350	258352	258353	Mr. Greene	564	" Not if one covets one 's neighbour 's wife,--or even his ass , "
258495	258505	258507	258508	Lady Albury	413	" Upon my word , your uncle is magnificent , "
258615	258631	258633	258633	Tony	433	" I hope she be to ride with us , off and on , Colonel , "
258642	258657	258633	258633	Tony	433	" Now and then , Tony , when we can get hold of Croppy . "
258658	258689	258633	258633	Tony	433	" Because , when they come out like that , Colonel , it 's a pity to lose 'em , just because they 's got their husbands to attend to . "
