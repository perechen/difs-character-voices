One thing only makes me uneasy : I fear that as I approach the prescribed limit , I may push it continually back , and that at forty - five I may still be thinking only of continuing to live and , perhaps , of continuing to scribble .

The punishment of Alfieri and of Mme . d'Albany for refusing to sacrifice their happiness to the proprieties of a society which married girls of nineteen to drunkards whom they had never seen , but which would not hear of divorce ; this punishment , falling directly only upon the man , but probably just as heavy upon the woman who witnessed the humiliation of the person whom she most loved and respected , consisted in turning Alfieri , the man who was training Italy to be self - respecting , truthful , unflinching , into a toady , a liar , and an intriguer .

41949	42470	41946	41946	she	2636	" how grateful I am to you for your compassion . You ca n't have a notion of our unhappiness . My misery is not in the least less than that of our friend . There are moments when I feel my heart torn to pieces thinking of all that he must suffer . I have no consolation except your being with him , and that is something . Never let him remain alone . He is worse , and I know that he greatly enjoys your society , for you are the only person who does not bore him and whom he always meets with pleasure . Oh ! dear Signor Francesco , in what a sea of miseries are we not ! You also , because our miseries are certainly also yours . I no longer live ; and if it were not for my friend , for whom I am keeping myself , I would not drag out this miserable life . What do I do in this world ? I am a useless creature in it ; and why should I suffer when it is of no use to anyone ? But my friend - I can not make up my mind to leave him , and he must live for his own glory ; and , as long as he lives , even if I had to walk on my hands , I would suffer and live . Who knows what will happen , it is so long since the man in Florence Charles Edward is ill , and still he lives , and it seems to me that he is made of iron in order that we may all die . You will say , in order to console me , that he ca n't last ; but I see things clearly . This illness has not made him younger , but he may live another couple of years . He may at any moment be suffocated by the humours which have risen to his chest . What a cruel thing to expect one 's happiness from the death of another ! O God ! how it degrades one 's soul ! And yet I can not refrain from wishing it . What a thing , what a horrible thing is life ; and for me it has been a continual suffering , all except the two years that I spent with my friend , and even then I lived in the midst of tears . And you also are probably not happy ; with a heart like yours it is not possible that you should be . Whoever is born with any feeling can scarcely enjoy happiness . I recommend our friend to your care , particularly his health . Mine is not so bad ; I take care of myself and stay much in bed to kill the time and to rest my nerves , which are very weak . Good - bye , dear Signor Francesco , preserve your friendship for me ; I deserve it , since I appreciate you . "
42478	42828	42473	42473	she	2644	" Dear Signor Francesco , friend of ours . I do all I can to take courage . I study as much as I can . Music alone distracts my thoughts , or rather deadens them , and I play the harp many hours a day , and I do so also because I know that my friend wishes me to get to play it well . I work at it as hard as I can . I live only for him ; without him life would be odious to me , and I could not endure it . I do nothing in this world ; I am useless in it ; and where is the use of suffering for nothing ? But there is my friend , and I must remain on this earth . I do not doubt of him ; I know how much he loves me . But in moments of suffering I have fears lest he should find someone who would give him less pain than myself , with whom he might live cheerful and happy . I ought to wish it , but I have not got the strength to do so . But I believe so fully in him that I am satisfied as soon as he tells me that such a thing can not happen . I love him more than myself ; it is a union of feeling which we only can understand . I find in him all that I can desire ; he is everything for me ; and yet I must suffer separation from him . Certainly if I could come to a violent decision I should be the happiest woman in the world ; I should never think of the past ; I should live in him and for him ; for I care for nothing in this world . Comfort , luxury , position , all is vanity for me ; peace by his side would suffice for me . And yet I am condemned to languish far from him . What a horrible life ! "
42836	43136	42830	42830	she	2645	" Dear friend , I am so very , very grateful for the interest you take in my unhappy situation , which is really terrible . Time serves only to aggravate it , and certainly it will bring no alleviation to my misery until I shall meet our friend . There is no peace , no tranquillity for me . I would give whatever of life may remain to me in order to live for one day with him , and I should be satisfied . My feelings for him are unchangeable , and I am sure that his for me are the same . When shall I see the end of my woes ? Who knows whether I shall ever see it ? That man Charles Edward does not seem inclined to depart ... I suffer a little from my nerves ... but those are the least of my sufferings . It is the heart which suffers . I have moments of despair when I could throw myself out of the window were it not for the thought that I must live for my friend 's sake ; that my life is his . I feel a disgust for life which is so reasoned out that I say to myself sometimes , ' Why do I live ? What good do I do ? ' and then I continue to suffer patiently , remembering my friend . Forgive me for unbosoming myself with you , who alone can understand me ; you alone , except my friend , understand what I suffer . Do you know , you ought to come and see me this winter , you would give me such a pleasure . Good - bye , dear Signor Francesco ; preserve your friendship for me . "

I do not feel very sorry for him : he cared little for life for its own sake , and the life which he was forced to lead was too far below his great soul , and the goodness and tenderness of his heart , and the nobility of his noble scornfulness . The person dearest to me of any , and immediately next to whom I loved Checco Gori most , knew and appreciated him and is not to be consoled for such a loss . I told him already last July , so many , many times , that he was not well , that he was growing visibly thinner day by day . Oh ! I ought never to have left him in this state . "

But the vulgar can not understand this , and knows us but little , and does not see that thy pure heart is the seat of virtue . "

On the other hand , it was a great consolation to know that , if I must die , I should die a free man , and between the two best beloved persons that I had , and whose love and esteem I believed myself to possess and to deserve .

If I do not hate him it is a result of Christian charity , and because we are desired to pardon . He drags out a miserable life , abandoned by all the world , without relatives or friends , given over to his servants ; but he has willed it thus , since he has never been able to live with anyone . Forgive me , Madame , for having entered into such details with you ; but the friendship which you have shown towards me obliges me to speak sincerely . "

The whole early part of the day , which begins at two for , going to bed at four in the morning , they rise only at mid - day , is spent in visits and exercise , for the English require , and their climate absolutely necessitates , a great deal of exercise . The coal smoke , the constant absence of sunshine , the heavy food and drink , make movement a necessity to them .... If England had an oppressive Government , this country and its inhabitants would be the lowest in the universe : a bad climate , bad soil , hence no sort of taste ; it is only the excellence of the political constitution which renders it inhabitable . The nation is melancholy , without any imagination , even without wit ; the dominant characteristic is a desire for money . "

You were , on the contrary , the agent of my liberation from a world for which I was in no way suited , and which I have not for a moment regretted .... I am in the enjoyment of perfect health , increased by liberty and peace of mind . I seek the society only of simple and virtuous persons without pretensions either to particular genius or to particular learning ; and besides such society I entertain myself with books , drawing , music , c.

O God ! what a misfortune to lose a person whom one adores and venerates at the same time . I think that if I still had Th√©r√®se Mme .

My hatred for the tyranny with which Bonaparte was oppressing Italy does not imply that I should love the house of Austria . The difference for me was that I hoped that Bonaparte 's ambition might bring about , if not the independence of Italy , at least such magnanimous deeds as might raise the Italians ; whereas the regular government of Austria precludes all such hopes . I should be mad and infamous if I desired for Italy , which requires peace at any price , new disorders and slaughterings ; but I should consider myself madder still and more infamous if , having despised to serve the foreigner who has fallen , I should accept to serve the foreigner who has succeeded ....
