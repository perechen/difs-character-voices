1178	1220	1149	1149	Undine	143	" what good have you ever done ? How are you better able to die now than you were last week ? You are nearer death , but are you ready , ready , ready , tick , tick , tick ? "
1236	1249	1221	1221	Undine	143	" Thousands , O Lord , are going to destruction every moment . "

1420	1442	1444	1448	the stiff and upright individual	262	" Undine , my dear , I really must report your conduct to your mamma ; it really is most reprehensible , "
1450	1485	1444	1448	the stiff and upright individual	262	" You surely have time enough in which to run about ; you might forget your play and worship God , when you come here . Your mamma thinks so . Do you not ? "
1628	1669	1671	1672	her mother	272	" Really , Undine , you are the hardest child to manage . There is no need to put on that look of proud indifference ; go to bed at once and let me see no more of you tonight , "
1812	1819	1821	1823	the little child	277	" Dear God ! great God ! "
1832	1872	1821	1823	the little child	277	" You who are so very happy and great and strong , who can do all things , O dear God ! save them . They are going , going , forever , forever , O God ! God ! "
1892	1944	1873	1873	She	223	" O God ! great God ! save just one soul tonight because I pray . I know that I am wicked and will never be saved , but I pray with faith ; save , oh save one soul , for my prayer . Great God ! God ! God ! "
2818	2854	2855	2855	She	223	" Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er . "

3396	3440	3442	3443	the governess	313	" Late again , my dear ; surely going to bed when you do , you might get up a little earlier . It is this sleeping so much that makes you so incurably stupid . Sannie and Annie were up hours ago , "
3473	3497	3499	3499	her	313	" They went to bed much later than you and were up earlier , and have done their hair much better than you , "

4701	4715	4681	4681	her	351	" Well , Undine , my dear , what have you to ask ? "
4716	4722	4724	4724	Undine	143	" I understand that chapter , "
4737	4779	4724	4724	Undine	143	" You do , my dear ! Well , then I suppose we had better reverse the order of things and I will question you . What was the oil which was generally burnt on all such occasions in the East ? "
4780	4786	4788	4788	Undine	143	" I do n't know , "
4793	4822	4824	4825	the teacher	354	" I thought that you understood everything that this chapter contained . I very soon find that you do not . You are wofully ignorant , my dear , "
4827	4843	4845	4845	Undine	143	" I did not notice that there was anything said about the kinds of oil , "
4847	4859	4845	4845	Undine	143	" otherwise I should not have said that I understood it . "
4876	4890	4871	4871	she	355	" What does the thirty - first verse speak of , my dear ? "
4891	4898	4900	4900	Undine	143	" The judgment of the world , "
4902	4923	4900	4900	Undine	143	" And what does he say to the good people on his right and the bad on his left hand ? "
4924	4932	4871	4871	she	355	" He says to the good people , "
4956	4967	4953	4954	the others	358	" Go , you cursed , into the everlasting fire√≠ . "
4968	4980	4900	4900	Undine	143	" And what lesson does this teach us , my dear ? "
4981	5006	5008	5008	Undine	143	" That God has prepared a heaven for the people he means to save and a hell for the people he means to burn , "
5035	5083	4900	4900	Undine	143	" Hardly the right way of putting it , my dear . It teaches you that you should be a very good little girl , so that when you die God may take you to heaven and not send you to hell to burn forever and ever . "
5084	5107	5109	5109	Undine	143	" I would much sooner be wicked and go to hell than be good only because I was afraid of going there , "
5131	5134	5137	5139	that unfortunate individual	360	" Undine ! "
5141	5165	5137	5139	that unfortunate individual	360	" Undine , what do you mean ? You were always an evil and wicked child , but you grow viler every day . "
5166	5169	5171	5171	Undine	143	" Yes , "
5200	5281	5188	5188	her	143	" yes , I do n't want to go to heaven , and , if God wants to , he can send me to hell and I will never again ask him not to , never . I know I 'm very wicked , but I 'm not half so wicked or so cruel as he is . Nothing is , not even the devil . The devil is glad when we go to hell , but he did not make us
5330	5374	5327	5327	I	0	" said Undine , who , with her wild dark eyes and clenched hands , looked more like some spirit who had just arrived from the regions of which she spoke than a carefully - brought - up little Christian receiving her Sunday lesson .
5912	5919	5921	5921	Undine	143	" The Mermaid and the Prince . "
6290	6299	6300	6300	she	389	" You can come out when you like , "
6649	6655	6657	6657	Frank	74	" Had him that time , "
6676	6684	6686	6686	Undine	143	" I wonder why you do that , "
6688	6697	6686	6686	Undine	143	" everything is miserable in the whole world . "
6713	6728	6710	6710	he	59	" So you 've been in the wars today , little woman , eh ? "
6742	6760	6735	6736	stroked Socrates	59	" Too bad to make you go without your dinner , little woman , was n't it ? "
6761	6770	6772	6772	Undine	143	" I do n't mind that one bit , "
6774	6793	6772	6772	Undine	143	" but I wish I had never been born . I 'm miserable , and nobody loves me . "
6794	6816	6818	6818	Frank	74	" Why , I do , and we all of us do , though you are such a queer little coon , "
6821	6829	6831	6831	Undine	143	" Yes , that 's just it , "
6852	6888	6831	6831	Undine	143	" Yes , that 's just it ; you only care about me because I 'm your sister ; you call me queer and strange ; you do n't like me one bit only Socrates . "
6889	6915	6917	6917	Frank	74	" Well , that is good . How do you know that Socrates likes you , and not the bread and butter you bring him ? "
6919	6926	6928	6928	Undine	143	" I know he likes me , "
6933	6981	6983	6983	Undine	143	" Ca n't I see it ? Do n't I know it ? When we sit together of an evening , I can feel he is thinking just what I am , and when I talk to him he understands me . That is what I hate , "
6994	7045	6983	6983	Undine	143	" people do n't know anything about it , and they say he has n't got a soul . How do they know , I should like to know ? If only people would not talk till they knew , I think the world would be a much nicer place . "
7081	7091	7093	7093	Undine	143	" I wish I were one of those ducks , "
7097	7106	7108	7108	Frank	74	" I do n't ; they look hot , "
7110	7128	7108	7108	Frank	74	" and I thought you said , just now , everything in the whole world was miserable . "
7129	7183	7231	7231	Undine	143	" Yes , but not so very miserable because they do n't think ; at least , perhaps they do ; but they 've no bibles , you see , and I do n't think the devil ever tempts them . It would not be worth his trouble , they are so small . "
7184	7205	7215	7215	his	396	" If he paid visits only on account of size , I expect you would not see much of him , "
7218	7225	7215	7215	his	396	" Are bibles your great trouble ? "
7226	7229	7231	7231	Undine	143	" Yes , "
7235	7375	7231	7231	Undine	143	" Sometimes I feel quite good , and I am sitting and reading , and I come to something that is quite different from what it was somewhere else . Then the devil makes me think , How can two things that say the opposite both be true ? And then I feel wicked and I ca n't go on reading any more . Sometimes , too , when I 'm praying and I feel as though I loved God very much , I remember all at once how it says in the Bible that he never forgives anyone for nothing , but always makes some one suffer pain first ; and I remember all the other cruel things it tells about him ; and then I hate him , and for a long time I ca n't pray again .
7379	7387	7388	7388	I	0	" she said after a little pause . "
7449	7472	7434	7434	you	408	" asked Undine , looking earnestly at him , as though with the vague hope that his answer might be in the affirmative .
7473	7482	7529	7530	the ducks	409	" No , I should rather think not , "
7487	7519	7529	7530	the ducks	409	" I used to make little clay oxen and train kids in an old box and enjoy myself ; that is what I used to do when I was your age . "
7532	7555	7556	7556	she	143	" I wonder if there are any people in the world who feel like I do and who have such wicked thoughts , "
7561	7595	7556	7556	she	143	" Of course there are , and much wickeder , too ; there are people who do n't believe the Bible is true , or anything else , and they write books also . "
7596	7600	7602	7602	Undine	143	" Do they ? "
7604	7616	7602	7602	Undine	143	" I wish I could read them . Have you ever ? "
7617	7620	7622	7622	Frank	74	" No , "
7624	7641	7622	7622	Frank	74	" it 's too much bother ; but I will , when I 'm a man ; "
7750	7770	7776	7776	they	412	" Take care of everything ; get into no mischief ; and above all remember that it is Sunday , "
7894	7898	7900	7900	Undine	143	" I wonder , "
7902	7918	7900	7900	Undine	143	" if Socrates and I were to run a race , which of us would beat "
8334	8339	8341	8343	that little maiden	427	" He is naughty , "
8474	8482	8493	8493	she	425	" You will fall down and die , "
8775	8791	8793	8794	her mother	272	" How did you get into this plight , you wicked , wicked little girl ? "
8822	8829	8830	8830	she	143	" I did not mean to , "
8844	8892	8830	8830	she	143	" Did not mean to ! Of course not ! You never mean to do anything that you do . The wind loosened Socrates and blew you both up onto the roof of the house ! Of course it did ; we all know that it did . "
8948	8955	8956	8956	she	143	" Undine , my dear Undine , "
8966	8989	8956	8956	she	143	" if you continue this course of action , what will become of your immortal soul ? What will become of it ? "
9020	9051	9053	9053	Undine	143	" I know I 'm wicked and I do n't care , and I do n't care what becomes of my soul , and I 'm not afraid of anything , "
9068	9077	9080	9081	a child	443	" Was there ever in this world so evil disposed
9083	9094	9080	9081	a child	443	" said her spiritual guide , shaking her head solemnly . "
9113	9113	9105	9105	I	0	"
9114	9119	9121	9121	Undine	143	" Good - night , "
9159	9193	9143	9143	she	143	" Oh , I wish I was dead ! I wish I was dead ! There is nobody like me , and nobody loves me . Oh , I wish I was dead ! "
9678	9685	9686	9686	he	74	" At your old work again , "
9691	9697	9686	9686	he	74	" You 've no idea , "
9703	9723	9686	9686	he	74	" what evil thoughts are always fermenting in that little innocent - looking head . It 's my decided opinion that
9772	9788	9765	9765	I	0	" said Frank , turning round onto his back , while Aunt Margaret and I laughed .
9789	9798	9799	9799	he	74	" It 's all very well to laugh , "
9802	9886	9888	9888	Frank	74	" but she is awfully bad , much worse than I am . She is only a little girl and she has not any right to have thoughts at all . It 's all very well for me to think that it 's a hard state of affairs when a poor fellow has to be called into existence for the purpose of being sent to fire and brimstone ; but it does not do for her ; it 's highly improper , highly , "
10536	10541	10542	10542	he	74	" You had better , "
10545	10627	10542	10542	he	74	" it 's great fun . I always do : I take my notebook and pencil ; one hears things worth remembering sometimes . Besides , you 'll get into hot water if you do n't go , and pretend to be edified , too . There are just three grand crimes according to your grandfather 's creed to give expression to an idea that has not been propounded at least one hundred times before you were born ; to believe in the
10647	10665	10678	10678	he	74	" I have been there , and still would go , ' Tis like a little heaven below "
10685	10689	10691	10691	he	74	" Golden Light , "
10788	10794	10796	10796	he	74	" those purgatorial Methodist planks , "
10827	10845	10824	10824	I	0	" Do you like going to revival meetings ? Do they do you good , Aunt Margaret ? "
10846	10856	10857	10857	she	497	" I do n't know that they ever did , "
10864	10916	10857	10857	she	497	" but Christ does show himself wonderfully sometimes ; and I feel , if only one soul is saved , it must be God 's own work and I must help it . Think , if only one soul be saved from endless pain and sin , what a glorious work . "
10927	10998	10924	10924	I	0	" I wish you could feel as I do , that our Father will let nothing he has made be lost forever . As long as I believe as you do I could not love him , nor serve him ; but since I have left off looking to the Bible , and listen to what he says in my own soul , I love him and I am happy . "
10999	11010	11011	11011	she	498	" I wish you could make me think so too , "
11014	11114	11115	11115	she	499	" but I know it is wrong even to say so . If once we listen to our own hearts and use our reason , we go away from God . Yet do you know , if some one whom I loved very much were to die not loving Christ , I think I am sure , I should go mad , quite mad . It is so terrible that you can not pray for them , that you can not do anything for them when once they are gone . We must pray for them now , now , "
11647	11659	11660	11660	he	85	" Do come up , dear friends , do come up , "
11693	11716	11717	11718	Brother Stiles	86	" Do come up , dear friends , do come up . While Brother Stiles engages in prayer , do come up . "
11740	11760	11730	11731	Brother Stubbles	87	" The time is young , dear friends . Will no one begin ? Will no one come up ? "
11805	11812	11813	11813	he	85	" Do come , do come , "
12498	12510	12511	12512	Miss Mell	91	" A pity she praises up those great fat girls so , "
12520	12548	12550	12551	Miss Mell	91	" They are the ugliest girls in the village , but she ca n't see it . She has a very good opinion of herself , too , "
12561	12597	12550	12551	Miss Mell	91	" and she imagines there is no other minister 's wife to be compared with her , and I know that she takes good care never to go where there is any infectious disease , and "
12616	12628	12629	12629	she	92	" Did you think I was very long gone , dear ? "
12644	12682	12683	12683	She	92	" It was a shame to leave you , but the dear good creatures would have it so , and I came back to you just as soon as I could , dear , just as soon . "
12716	12757	12760	12760	Ma	94	" What were you talking about , dears , when I came in ? I am sure it was something very entertaining ; Miss Mell 's conversation always is so entertaining . As Sarah Jane said to me yesterday afternoon : "
12788	12788	12782	12782	we	541	"
12789	12803	12805	12806	Miss Mell	91	" Very . Did I tell you that Alice Brown had come back ? "
12808	12849	12805	12806	Miss Mell	91	" No , dear , you did not ; but when I was up at Mrs. Barnacles ' this morning she told me of it , and that she has grown into such a beautiful girl ! Is it true ? "
12850	12853	12855	12856	Miss Mell	91	" Beautiful ! "
12874	12932	12862	12862	her	91	" I should beg to be excused from such beauty ! She 's as large as an elephant and a great deal coarser , and as for her forest of hair the best thing she could do with it would be to cut it off ; it 's as black and coarse as a horse 's tail ! "
12933	12943	12945	12946	Mrs. Goodman	92	" I do n't know what she looks like , "
12952	12962	12949	12949	her	92	" but she 's been very badly brought up . "
12963	12967	12969	12970	Miss Mell	91	" Brought up ! "
12972	12996	12969	12970	Miss Mell	91	" Why , she has not been brought up at all . They were the lowest people in the place till they got this money
13026	13026	13015	13015	you	545	"
13027	13037	13039	13040	Mrs. Goodman	92	" No , my dear , I heard nothing , "
13057	13066	13068	13069	Miss Mell	91	" It 's about two years ago now , "
13071	13226	13068	13069	Miss Mell	91	" Mr. Albert Blair was swimming in the great pool near Brown 's house and got cramp . He called for help , and the girl she was then about fifteen happened to hear him . You will hardly credit it , but in place of going for some one , she actually had the immodesty to tear off her own clothes and leap in ; and , as if that were not enough , she actually carried him in her arms up to their house . You may believe me , for I had it all on the best authority ; my servant was very intimate with the Browns in those days , and she told me all about it . She said , too , that he sent her ever so many presents afterwards , and thought nothing of stopping to speak with her in the streets the brazen - faced creature . "
13227	13235	13237	13238	Mrs. Goodman	92	" Is it possible , my dear ! "
13240	13254	13237	13238	Mrs. Goodman	92	" How wanting in modesty and self - respect ! How very shocking ! "
13255	13272	13274	13275	Miss Mell	91	" It 's not the worst thing we shall hear of her , mark my words , "
13309	13322	13324	13325	Mrs. Goodman	92	" Ah ! this is a sad , sad , wicked world , "
13339	13369	13335	13335	her	92	" As I said to Sarah Jane only this morning , if once we depend on our own weak selves how miserably we shall fail , fail , fail ! "
13397	13400	13391	13392	my grandmother	456	" Yes . "
13401	13458	13391	13392	my grandmother	456	" Ah ! you may well say yes , dear . I have had a dreadful blow this evening . Oh , it is a wicked , wicked world in which we live . If my dear girls had not given their hearts to Christ , I should tremble for them , yes , even for them "
13479	13485	13487	13488	Miss Mell	91	" What have you heard ? "
13496	13528	13487	13488	Miss Mell	91	" Oh , you know all about it , no doubt , dear about Dr. Harper , who I always thought such a dear , good man , and Mrs. Harvey . "
13529	13541	13543	13544	Miss Mell	91	" Dr. Harper and Mrs. Harvey ! I 've heard nothing , "
13546	13635	13487	13488	Miss Mell	91	" You do n't say so , my dear ! I 'm so grieved I said one word about it . I made sure you knew it all . You know I never talk about such things , never , never ; but , oh ! it is the saddest , saddest thing I 've heard for a long , long time ; though I always knew that that Mrs. Harvey was not a good woman . I said so long ago at the time she left our chapel for
13664	13790	13652	13652	she	100	" and there followed the relation , in minutest detail , of things such as I had not even dreamed of , whose hideous shadow had never yet been thrown across my young life . From my lonely African home I had brought an ignorance of evil and of that which , holy and pure in itself , man 's folly has made so that might have been thought strange in a child of six years . Much that had been cause of vague speculation and wonder was made clear to me that night , and I was wretched ; for , alas ! is it not the old , old story that the tree of knowledge is the tree of pain , and that , "
13801	13811	13662	13662	she	100	" stand written on every fruit of the wonderful tree ?
14124	14134	14135	14135	she	77	" I thought I should find you in bed , "
14143	14156	14135	14135	she	77	" Which are you studying your little bare toes or the candle ? "
14157	14160	14161	14161	I	0	" Neither , "
14164	14198	14161	14161	I	0	" but I wish I was not a woman . I hate women ; they are horrible and disgusting , and I wish I had never been born rather than to be one . "
14199	14223	14231	14231	her	77	" Why , darling , what is the matter now ? I am very glad I am a woman ; it is so sweet "
14237	14247	14248	14248	she	77	" Did you like the revival meeting this evening ? "
14255	14269	14270	14270	I	0	" No . It was horrible . I am never going to another , "
14275	14293	14231	14231	her	77	" Oh yes , you will . You will make papa so angry if you do not . "
14294	14301	14302	14302	I	0	" I ca n't help it , "
14305	14369	14302	14302	I	0	" There are some places that make one wicked , and it 's not right to go to them . I feel tonight as if everyone in the world were a hypocrite , and I shall be one too , if I go to these places just for the sake of pleasing some one else as bad as Miss Mell and Mrs. Goodman . "
14400	14480	14398	14398	sweet	563	" and she went out and I was left alone with my red light . I soon got chilly and sleepy and crept into bed . I remember that day because , first , on it the joy and peace I had lived in for two years began to break ; because on it I first entered the shadow of that cloud in whose darkness I was to walk for years , hoping nothing , believing nothing , trusting nothing .
15032	15050	15051	15051	he	81	" I find your name in this book , so I suppose you must have dropped it , "
15060	15090	15051	15051	he	81	" The waves were very nearly stealing it , as I fear they may you one of these days , if you continue such a very zealous little naturalist . "
15091	15110	15112	15112	Undine	143	" I 'm not a naturalist ; I do n't know anything about fishes or about anything else , "
15137	15170	15120	15121	Cousin Jonathan	81	" They say , when we know our own deficiencies they are half rectified . You would like to know all about a strange little fellow like this , would you not ? "
15171	15181	15182	15182	she	143	" I would like to know something about him , "
15202	15237	15182	15182	she	143	" When I was at home I used to try and learn a little about plants and insects , but I never had anyone to help me and I had not the right books . "
15238	15247	15248	15248	he	584	" Perhaps I could help you a little , "
15251	15252	15248	15248	he	584	" at
15283	15283	15182	15182	she	143	"
15284	15290	15292	15292	Undine	143	" I do n't know , "
15294	15322	15323	15323	she	143	" but I never see anything beautiful without wanting to have it , especially if it 's very hard to get . It 's not beautiful now , "
15336	15349	15350	15350	he	584	" I never can see some beautiful things without wishing for them , "
15446	15454	15455	15455	he	584	" We must go home to breakfast , "
16067	16073	16075	16076	Mr. Roch	104	" You must make haste , "
16078	16096	16075	16076	Mr. Roch	104	" and get your tea done ; the meeting begins in three - quarters of an hour . "
16097	16108	16110	16111	the grandmother	610	" You must take care to wrap yourself up warmly , "
16113	16123	16110	16111	the grandmother	610	" you are not accustomed to our climate yet . "
16124	16130	16132	16132	Undine	143	" I am not going , "
16134	16140	16132	16132	Undine	143	" What do you say ? "
16167	16178	16179	16179	she	611	" I am not going to the meeting this evening , "
16192	16206	16208	16209	Aunt Margaret	77	" Do you feel ill tonight , dear ? You look very pale , "
16211	16228	16208	16209	Aunt Margaret	77	" I am quite well , thank you ; but I would rather not go tonight . "
16229	16239	16248	16248	himself	74	" I wish all my household to be there , "
16253	16269	16271	16275	the poor nervous little grandmother	612	" Perhaps she wishes to stay with Frank , as it is the last evening , "
16282	16289	16296	16296	his	74	" Frank is going with Margaret , "
16358	16374	16375	16375	she	143	" I would rather not go , I do n't mind staying alone at all , "
16380	16389	16395	16395	his	614	" Why do you not wish to go ? "
16401	16427	16395	16395	his	614	" I do n't think it is I mean I do n't get any good from going , and , I would rather stay please . "
16441	16450	16455	16455	his	614	" Why do you not wish to go ? "
16476	16485	16486	16486	she	143	" Because it would be wicked of me , "
16508	16521	16504	16504	she	143	" I ca n't go and pretend to be serving God when all "
16522	16526	16528	16529	her grandfather	614	" Be silent , "
16531	16542	16528	16529	her grandfather	614	" Little children who act in this manner should be whipped and
16563	16563	16553	16553	you	143	"
16774	16777	16779	16781	the old man	624	" Conquered , "
16814	16844	16801	16801	he	624	" It is very hard and bitter to have to go after all this , but because it is bitter it must be right to go just this once , at
16852	16869	16801	16801	he	624	" So she reasoned as she walked beside him on the way to the little Methodist chapel .
16945	16953	16954	16956	the poor creature	629	" I do n't want to go , "
16997	17007	16978	16979	Mrs. Goodman	92	" Go up , my dear ; go up . "
17035	17038	17039	17041	The poor preacher	631	" up . "
17166	17211	17212	17213	Mrs. Jones	105	" A word in season , my dear Mrs. Jones , a word in season ; let us be thankful when the dear Lord allows us to speak a word in season , allows us poor weak voices to speak a word for him . "
17391	17410	17388	17388	she	92	" What a dear , good creature Mrs. Jones is ! What a pity she should think so much of
17439	17439	17388	17388	she	92	"
17440	17445	17447	17448	Miss Mell	91	" Yes , indeed , "
17450	17455	17447	17448	Miss Mell	91	" yes , indeed . "
17456	17465	17467	17468	Mrs. Goodman	92	" And her poor husband , my dear , "
17470	17501	17467	17468	Mrs. Goodman	92	" he ca n't stand it , my dear , he ca n't stand it . Did you notice the really su perb silk she had on really su perb . "
17502	17515	17517	17518	Miss Mell	91	" I do n't think it was silk ; it was alpaca , "
17520	17563	17517	17518	Miss Mell	91	" Alpaca , my dear ! You are quite mistaken . She sat close to the rails , and I was looking at it from the time she came in till we went out , and what a lovely brown it was . "
17564	17574	17576	17577	Miss Mell	91	" I think you are mistaken about the silk , "
17586	17596	17598	17599	Mrs. Goodman	92	" I know it 's silk , my dear , "
17601	17636	17598	17599	Mrs. Goodman	92	" We were in the middle of the first prayer when she came in , and I heard the rustle of the silk as soon as ever she opened the door . I thought , "
17650	17651	17641	17641	I	0	" "
17658	17663	17641	17641	I	0	" said Miss Mell . "
17675	17675	17666	17666	she	647	"
17676	17694	17696	17697	Mrs. Goodman	92	" Yes , it 's a great pity ; she is such a dear , good creature , "
17703	17732	17696	17697	Mrs. Goodman	92	" it is a sad , sad pity she should be so close : the fly , the fly in the pot of ointment , my dear . Ah !
17736	17749	17666	17666	she	647	" And so the good souls continued their conversation all the way home .
17815	17823	17824	17824	she	77	" What is making you so happy ? "
17827	17844	17824	17824	she	77	" You look like one of the little angels I used to dream about long ago . "
17845	17848	17850	17850	Undine	143	" Nothing , "
18212	18214	18183	18183	They	660	" Tekel "
18476	18482	18483	18483	he	682	" How old are you ? "
18491	18495	18483	18483	he	682	" Thirteen years . "
18496	18528	18483	18483	he	682	" Have you always tried to do as your conscience told you ? But , no , stay . Had you no one who gave you bread and butter and shoes ? "
18529	18532	18483	18483	he	682	" Yes . "
18533	18565	18483	18483	he	682	" Oh , then they kept your conscience . If you only tried to obey them Well and faithfully done , enter into joy , and sit down on a throne . "
18872	18875	18876	18876	He	614	" Grandfather . "
18888	18894	18895	18895	he	614	" What is the matter ? "
18939	18947	18913	18913	Undine	143	" I am not going to chapel . "
18948	18985	18989	18989	he	614	" I thought I had given you clearly to understand , Undine , on a previous occasion , that I wished you always to go . I allow no disregard of my wishes in this house . "
19010	19016	19017	19017	she	143	" I am not going , "
19020	19103	19017	19017	she	143	" It is a wicked cruel world in which one human being has power over another , but you can not make me do what I think is wrong ; and if I go to chapel just because I fear you I shall be a hypocrite like all the others who go there ; and I will not . All people who love Christ should keep away from such places , which only bring disgrace and shame upon his name . If he came
19143	19143	19133	19133	I	0	"
19492	19496	19498	19498	Undine	143	" Go away , "
19502	19511	19498	19498	Undine	143	" I am alone . Leave me alone . "
19512	19560	19561	19561	Undine	143	" Undine darling , what have I done to you ? What has anyone done to you ? Undine , you say you love Christ and are trying to be his child . Do n't you think you were wrong to speak as you did just now ? "
19581	19585	19561	19561	Undine	143	" Please go away "
19893	19910	19888	19888	they	726	" What shall the colour of the study curtains be red , green , or yellow ? "
19911	19914	19916	19916	Undine	143	" Blue , "
19917	19935	19916	19916	Undine	143	" blue , just the colour of the sea where it lies at rest , far away . "
19936	19945	19946	19947	Aunt Margaret	77	" No , no ; not that colour , "
19952	19979	19946	19947	Aunt Margaret	77	" I never did so before , but this afternoon I hate it . Every time I look up and see it , I hate it . "
19980	19986	19988	19988	Undine	143	" Look at that cloud , "
19990	20019	19988	19988	Undine	143	" when we came ' twas a tiny speck we could hardly see , and now ' tis like a great fairy snow - ship in the sky . "
20112	20112	20068	20068	Undine	143	"
20183	20191	20193	20193	Frank	74	" Delilah , you are bewitching me , "
20217	20233	20198	20198	he	74	" I promised to be at Leeford tonight ; must be there , in fact . "
20234	20241	20243	20244	Aunt Margaret	77	" It 's too late now , "
20259	20274	20243	20244	Aunt Margaret	77	" if you walk ever so fast you can not get there before dark . "
20275	20302	20243	20244	Aunt Margaret	77	" I shall not walk ; I shall hire a boat in the village and two boys , and shall be back again by ten o'clock . "
20303	20312	20313	20313	she	143	" It is the last evening , Frank , "
20325	20339	20313	20313	she	143	" the last for four whole weeks . Be sure you come back . "
20394	20408	20380	20380	he	74	" Only till ten o'clock , you know , only till ten o'clock . "
20418	20429	20431	20431	Undine	143	" Shall I pull the flowers out of your hair ? "
20433	20467	20431	20431	Undine	143	" No ; I leave them there ; I feel like only a little child tonight . Oh , Undine , I hope you will one day be as happy as I am . "
20616	20634	20636	20636	Undine	143	" It is no use looking out any longer ; he will not come tonight , Golden , "
20649	20672	20673	20673	she	143	" No , no , you do not know him as I do . He would do anything rather than disappoint me , "
20676	20684	20686	20686	Undine	143	" But the boys , the boys , "
20688	20700	20686	20686	Undine	143	" they would never venture out on a night like this . "
20701	20708	20725	20725	Undine	143	" Then he would come alone . "
20743	20749	20725	20725	Undine	143	" What time is it ? "
20756	20766	20768	20768	Undine	143	" I do n't think it 's very late , "
20904	20910	20914	20914	she	143	" It is just twelve , "
20920	20932	20914	20914	she	143	" He will not come tonight ; it is too late . "
20933	20940	20941	20942	Aunt Margaret	77	" Too late , too late ! "
20952	21063	20941	20942	Aunt Margaret	77	" I never prayed for him as I ought , I never kept on praying till I felt God 's answer , and now I can do nothing more for him , nothing more . It is what I deserve , it is God 's punishment on me for loving a man who mocked His name , who had no faith in Christ ; but , Undine , Undine , heaven will be no heaven to me if he is not there . I would give my soul so willingly to reclaim his ; I could bear all for him . Pray , Undine , pray . I can not . "
21092	21099	21101	21102	Aunt Margaret	77	" Talk , Undine , talk , "
21104	21105	21101	21102	Aunt Margaret	77	" If
21115	21159	21106	21106	you	143	" And Undine talked on , the words of her own sweet dreamy faith talked on till Aunt Margaret fell asleep with her head in the child 's lap . Then at last Undine leaned her forehead against the chair , and slept also .
21306	21345	21298	21298	he	755	" Do you know who went out at the front door last night and left it open ? I felt the cold wind blowing in , and had to go down and close it , about four o'clock . "
21433	21438	21420	21420	She	143	" Has he come ? "
21855	21904	21839	21840	Her grandmother	611	" Oh , he is dead ! Poor Frank is dead ! They have found his body , and the boy 's that was with him . And my darling , my poor darling , where is she ? It will kill her ! It will kill her ! "
22114	22121	22092	22092	she	143	" Ha - ha - ha ! "
22154	22240	22092	22092	she	143	" Ha - ha - ha ! There they come one , two , three ; there they come the devils that have got his soul , hundreds of them , thousands of them . That is the door they took him down , there . I asked God to take me instead , but He would not , and now they have got me too . He used to say there was no God , and no hell , but God will show him now .
22259	22259	22251	22252	Little devils	798	"
22351	22430	22347	22347	it	799	" I know you , who you are . You look like Undine ; but you are the devil ; the devil to whom God gave his soul . I know , I know . You left his body lying there upon the beach , and you tore it with your cruel hands that I might not know it when I found it lying there in the grey dawn : but I knew it , I knew it . "
22495	22514	22524	22524	Undine	143	" I have killed the devil ! I have killed the devil ! Ha - ha - ha ! "
23174	23184	23166	23167	Miss Mell	91	" for those who like that style of beauty . "
23271	23279	23280	23281	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" I 'm terribly anxious about her , "
23285	23326	23280	23281	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" It 's not that she is old ; she is a mere child ; but I do n't see what 's to make her change ; and if no one ever sees her , who 's to marry her ? "
23357	23413	23280	23281	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" She has need of all her good looks , if she is to go off ; men do n't take readily to those queer , dull sorts of girls ; and with those idiotic ideas of hers , on religious matters , too , half the men would not have her as a gift . "
23414	23421	23422	23423	Miss Mell	91	" Of course they would not , "
23429	23512	23422	23423	Miss Mell	91	" and I believe it 's all put on too her not going to chapel and all the rest of it just to be peculiar . It 's all nonsense . What does she know about such things ? For clever learned men it 's all very well , but a stupid child like her ought to be well whipped and fed on bread and water for six months ; that would take the nonsense out of her better than anything else . "
23513	23516	23517	23518	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Yes , "
23522	23561	23562	23562	She	96	" for men it 's all very well , as you say ; but a woman , and one who lives on charity , ought to keep them to herself if she has ideas of that unwomanly kind . "
23576	23640	23562	23562	She	96	" Go to chapel and give up reading those nonsensical books , and act like other people even if you do n't think like them . It wo n't answer , it wo n't answer at all ; and you had better give up all this sort of thing before it 's too late . You 'll repent it if you do n't . "
23997	24004	24005	24005	he	81	" Where are your thoughts wandering ? "
24035	24038	24008	24008	he	81	" Nowhere , "
24043	24054	24055	24055	he	81	" That is the answer you always make me now , "
24061	24078	24055	24055	he	81	" you do n't make a friend of me now as you used to , Undine . "
24079	24101	24119	24119	his	81	" Because I ca n't . There never was much sympathy between us on any subject ; there is none now . "
24102	24112	24113	24113	he	81	" It is you who do not understand me , "
24203	24209	24210	24210	he	81	" What is the matter ? "
24233	24239	24240	24240	she	143	" Nothing is the matter , "
24245	24261	24240	24240	she	143	" only I am not quite so old as you and believe in perpetual motion . "
24349	24361	24362	24362	she	143	" How dared you intrude upon me in my private residence ! "
24368	24388	24362	24362	she	143	" Is it not enough to make me disagreeable ? Why do n't you wait till I invite you ? "
24389	24402	24403	24403	he	81	" I should have to wait a long time , I fear , "
24411	24477	24478	24478	She	143	" Perhaps so , but death may make me more agreeable and sociable ; and , as I am sure to die long before you , when you hear that I have departed this life you may come and hold converse with my spirit under this tree . I mean to haunt it , if the old monster does not quite dissolve me into nothingness . "
24495	24502	24504	24505	Cousin Jonathan	81	" You have a queer mind , "
24507	24549	24504	24505	Cousin Jonathan	81	" As surely as you seem to be in one of your merry moods , you drag in some grim and ghostly thing to spoil it all . I do n't believe you know what it is to be gladly happy . "
24550	24714	24478	24478	She	143	" Perhaps not . I know that when I was a child and used to romp most wildly and do mad things that none of the others dared , it was just because I was not happy . Whenever my thoughts and miseries were too great for me , I used to let off steam by doing something terribly naughty ; and when I had been lying awake all night under my bed , in the greatest agony about my sins and other people 's , I used to get up and have the most desperate of romps all by myself . I remember one day , when I was only seven years old , having the story of Cain and Abel for my Sunday lesson . It made a great impression on me . If God accepted Abel 's sacrifice not because of its value but because of his faith , why , if I only had faith , should not fire come down
25263	25263	25249	25249	I	0	"
25306	25316	25317	25317	he	81	" You have changed strangely since those old days , "
25320	25342	25317	25317	he	81	" I do n't think you are troubled with too much faith now ; you believe in nothing under the sun . "
25343	25353	25354	25354	she	143	" That only proves what I said just now , "
25357	25375	25354	25354	she	143	" You do n't understand me . I believe more truly in some things than you do . "
25376	25383	25317	25317	he	81	" In what , for instance ? "
25384	25461	25354	25354	she	143	" Oh , in more than one . You said yesterday that there was no such thing as a love that must live while the soul lives ; that wrong or neglect can change the love that can be felt but once in a lifetime for one human being and which is the best of earthly things . You pooh - poohed it and called it dreaming , not reasoning . I merely return the compliment . "
25503	25582	25494	25494	he	81	" With your magnificent intellect and your profound reasoning faculties whereby you profess to test everything , one might almost expect you to show a somewhat deeper knowledge of life and human nature . But after all you are only a child , and will grow wiser , when you have seen more of the world , than to believe that love can live without hope or return , any more than a body without food or air . "
25646	25685	25696	25696	she	143	" You read all manner of trash and sentimentality till your mind is completely enervated ; you came down here this afternoon to read some of Mrs. Browning 's poetry and effete nonsense , I have no doubt . "
25686	25695	25696	25696	she	143	" There lies what I have been reading , "
25709	25721	25696	25696	she	143	" There is nothing very sentimental in that , I fancy . "
25722	25742	25743	25743	he	874	" You are likely to get just as much good from this style of reading as from the other , "
25752	25763	25764	25764	she	143	" You are difficult to please , my old father , "
26265	26272	26273	26273	he	81	" Are you fond of reading ? "
26341	26345	26346	26346	she	143	" At times , "
26378	26390	26391	26391	he	81	" You have Mill 's Political Economy here , I see , "
26394	26415	26391	26391	he	81	" I am just going through his works with very great pleasure . They are beautiful , are they not ? "
26416	26419	26421	26421	Undine	143	" Very , "
26684	26692	26694	26695	Cousin Jonathan	81	" What do you think of them ? "
26710	26713	26715	26715	Undine	143	" Nothing , "
26717	26740	26715	26715	Undine	143	" The son has not a bone in his whole composition , and the father is all bone , or something harder . "
26757	26771	26772	26772	he	81	" I wonder if you ever did meet anyone whom you approved of , "
26782	26784	26749	26749	her	143	" c "
26795	26918	26789	26789	Coonie	122	" You are quite right with regard to the father , however ; he is not troubled with too much tenderness of heart . The first time he married it was to a lady of very good family , whom he married just on account of her blood . He led her a very fine life , and when she died at the end of two years he married a woman who was immensely rich and whom he liked still less and treated still worse . She left him all her money when she died ; but I believe he hates her son , who was here this afternoon , just because he is hers . I never saw them together before . "
26919	26926	26928	26928	Undine	143	" Has he any other children ? "
26930	26973	26928	26928	Undine	143	" Yes , Albert , his eldest . In my pedagogue days , before I married Mrs. Barnacles , he was my pupil . He is here now , and is sure to call and see me in a day or two . "
27461	27467	27468	27468	He	81	" You believe in nothing . "
27477	27482	27468	27468	He	81	" and love nothing . "
28084	28094	28096	28097	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" You must mean Alice Brown , I think , "
28105	28138	28096	28097	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" they say she is growing more and more beautiful . It 's very queer , but whenever the Blairs are here , she is . Generally she lives with her grandmother . "
28139	28147	28149	28149	Undine	143	" I should like to know her , "
28151	28160	28162	28163	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Oh , they are only common people , "
28165	28173	28162	28163	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" We do n't associate with them . "
28840	28848	28850	28851	Harry Blair	121	" You seem fascinated by this picture , "
28861	28890	28856	28856	he	121	" It is my favourite also , but I confess I like it only because of the woman 's face ; I can make nothing out of it . "
28891	28902	28904	28904	Undine	143	" It seems to me to tell its own story , "
28918	29022	28856	28856	he	121	" He was a noble , high - blooded lord , and she a poor serf , with only her soul and beautiful body to give him . He hardly cared to take them , though it was for nothing ; and now , in the hour of death , she has followed him and found him lying dead ; and she is crouching at his feet in agony because he is gone , and in wild joy because he is hers alone now , hers and no other 's , if only that she may lie at his feet and die there . "
29023	29031	29050	29051	Harry Blair	121	" A very desirable fate , certainly , "
29086	29091	29065	29065	Undine	143	" Piece of divine perfection "
29788	29813	29759	29759	he	987	" You seem to find your book singularly entertaining this evening . You have not looked at it once in the last half hour . "
29822	29833	29814	29815	His brother	989	" Quite as entertaining as those everlasting blue papers of yours "
29843	29859	29814	29815	His brother	989	" Do n't you think Miss Bock is very like the woman in that picture ? "
29860	29884	29886	29887	Albert Blair	97	" What woman , and what picture ? You should try and be a little more explicit if you wish for an answer , "
29904	29922	29924	29925	his brother	989	" Of course I mean the picture we were looking at when you came up this afternoon , "
29942	29973	29975	29976	his brother	989	" Yes , possibly there is a resemblance ; but your divinity has not nearly such a delicate hand ; and a good hand ranks next to a good figure , "
30023	30082	30018	30018	he	97	" There is no occasion to excite yourself about what I say , my dear fellow . She is a very pretty little girl , an uncommonly pretty little girl ; beats Lady Edith and her sister hollow ; only rather too careless about her dress , and a little peculiar in her manner , that 's all . "
30361	30366	30367	30367	she	118	" Think of him ? "
30370	30433	30435	30435	Undine	143	" He is only an equally proportioned mixture of ice and iron . With all his deference and politeness , he would freeze one or crush one to atoms with as little compunction as a fly , if one happened to stand in his path . I do n't like his brother , I dislike the father , and I detest him , "
30466	30476	30477	30477	she	143	" What a contemptible little wretch I am becoming ! "
30485	30529	30477	30477	she	143	" to allow such trivialities to break into my real life and drive out higher thought . Am I no better than other women after all ? I 've no heart ; if I lose my head what is to become of me ? "
30969	31013	31014	31014	he	97	" Still , I must keep Lady Edith well in hand . If these speculations should fail , it must come to marrying her . She dresses in good taste and is in perfect style but I would rather it were her sister , "
31288	31304	31305	31305	Harry	128	" Why do you always change the topic when our conversation turns to religious subjects ? "
31390	31396	31398	31398	Undine	143	" Religion is like love , "
31400	31417	31398	31398	Undine	143	" It flourishes best in silence , and is to be felt , not spoken of . "
31418	31432	31433	31433	he	121	" I do n't mean merely what one may call emotional religious subjects , "
31449	31496	31433	31433	he	121	" You were arguing last night with Mrs. Barnacles about the right or wrong of committing suicide . You never talk with me about such things ; your conversation with me is always about the smallest trivialities , such as you talk of to Miss Mell . "
31528	31538	31539	31539	she	143	" You must be contented with what you get , "
31542	31551	31539	31539	she	143	" But you give me so very little . "
31589	31615	31582	31582	she	143	" I give light where I get it . When you enlighten my spiritual darkness , I shall try and do as much for yours . "
31658	31699	31701	31701	Undine	143	" If a bird is only fitted to live among the marshes and reeds in the valley , why tempt it after you to the cold high rocks where the eagle finds a glorious life in the clear cold air ? "
31826	31834	31836	31836	Undine	143	" I am sorry to hear it , "
31841	31852	31853	31853	he	1035	" Why should you be sorry that I resemble you ? "
31856	31866	31867	31867	she	143	" I was not aware that you did so , "
31870	31897	31898	31898	He	1035	" Will you please tell me the name of that little purple flower ? I wish I had all at my finger ends that you have . "
31931	31946	31947	31947	he	1035	" I wish you would choose out one flower and give it to me , "
31958	31964	31947	31947	he	1035	" May I have one ? "
31965	31971	31973	31973	Undine	143	" Of course you may , "
31981	31992	31973	31973	Undine	143	" They are very pretty ; choose which you like . "
31993	32005	32006	32006	he	1035	" I care nothing about it unless you give it me , "
32019	32022	32023	32023	she	143	" There , "
32048	32080	32082	32083	his angel	1040	" How long the shades are growing . I really must go and get tea ready . I 'm very discourteous to dismiss you in this way , am I not ? "
32096	32104	32105	32105	he	1035	" What a poor fool I am ! "
32173	32204	32147	32147	he	1035	" Who drinks of Cupid 's nectar cup Loves downwards , and not up : He who loves of Gods and men Shall not by the same be loved again . "

32382	32391	32358	32358	he	121	" Be back at the beginning of summer ? "
32392	32400	32360	32361	his father	388	" Perhaps so . Depends on circumstances . "
32401	32409	32360	32361	his father	388	" When are you taking yourself off ? "
32410	32415	32358	32358	he	121	" Do n't know . "
32459	32470	32472	32473	the father	884	" There is no need to ask when you go , "
32488	32514	32472	32473	the father	884	" We all know you are booked for Greenwood till a certain individual , despairing of a richer morsel , shall consent to swallow you . "
32561	32584	32555	32555	he	121	" I must beg of you to say no more upon a subject upon which you are in total and absolute ignorance . "
32611	32620	32622	32623	the father	884	" As to my being in total ignorance , "
32625	32677	32622	32623	the father	884	" I know nearly as much of your little beauty as you do yourself , and infinitely more about woman in general , I fancy . She would think no more of throwing you overboard , along with her books and her flowers , if by doing so she could gain a few

32762	32793	32756	32756	he	121	" I would have knocked them down his throat ; as it is , I will only prove to you that they are a lie , a cowardly dastardly lie . "
32802	32907	32794	32795	His father	388	" You surely forget in whose house you are standing , whose money it is that causes women to look at you ! Go and tell your beautiful Undine that your father has turned you out of his house , that you have not a penny in the world , nor the wits to make one ; go and tell her that your father would rather see his money rolling in the gutter than that a penny of it should ever come to you . Go and tell her that , and see what her answer will be ! Go , go at once . "

I trust I feel in fact convinced that you have understood what the attraction has been which has led me so often to your cousin 's house . Though so much your senior in years , I trust , my dear Miss Bock , that you will believe me when I assure you that the affection which I offer you is as ardent and as sincere as that which any younger man might give you , and that , with the will , I have also the power to surround my wife and such , if you will permit me , I would make you with everything which can induce to happiness . I can not ask , I would not desire , an immediate answer . It is of course only right that you should first seek the advice of your friends ; but will you not give me some hope , however faint it may be ? "

33844	33882	33841	33841	he	624	" and unless you should write to me , having altered your mind , as I sincerely hope you may do , it may be long before we meet again . Good - bye , Miss Bock . "

34692	34740	34741	34741	she	143	" I will say nothing about it to Cousin Jonathan . It must make a man feel wretchedly small to find that another knows his love has been thrown back at him . And I suppose it is a kind of love they both have for me , "

34863	34937	34855	34855	she	143	" Here is a man who has been more than a father to me , and yet whenever I look at him I detest him . And two men have told me this morning that they loved me , and I feel no sorrow that I ca n't return it as a true - hearted woman would .

35259	35300	35246	35246	she	143	" And he gave up everything for you ! His father has vowed to have nothing more to do with him ; and now all the world will say that you did not marry him because he had no prospects . "

36691	36764	36765	36765	he	97	" a pretty little thing , and if she were trained might be good for something . She would not care to be any man 's wife , she tells my poor fool of a brother . Well , if these affairs of mine turn out well and I am able to indulge a fancy , who knows ? How should you like a certain little eccentricity for a mistress , Prince ? "
36780	36824	36765	36765	he	97	" Whether I ever let things go as far as that or not , I may see what I can do with her . Ha , ha ! How wrathful the poor boy would be , and the old one too , for I think
36832	36865	36825	36825	he	97	" And Albert Blair smiled his quiet smile . He had but one smile for friend or foe , for prince and beggar , which meant nothing , told nothing , showed nothing .
36962	36975	36976	36976	she	143	" It was so cruel of him to go away like this , "
36981	37020	36976	36976	she	143	" he knows how that hateful Miss Mell and Mrs. Goodman will talk and say he cares nothing for me , to go away and leave me when I am so ill , and yet he does it . "
37095	37100	37101	37101	Undine	143	" I was thinking , "
37104	37108	37101	37101	Undine	143	" of going to stay
37142	37142	37132	37132	I	0	"
37153	37174	37176	37177	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Why do n't you take a book and read ? You could turn up a corner of the blind , "
37179	37191	37193	37193	Undine	143	" I do n't care to read today , thank you , "
37195	37206	37208	37209	the invalid	1163	" Why , what on earth has come to you ? "
37232	37240	37242	37242	Undine	143	" Tell him she is no better , "
37244	37254	37256	37257	the girl	630	" But he wanted to see Miss Bock herself , "
37308	37318	37319	37319	he	97	" Your cousin is seriously ill , I hear , "
37329	37344	37319	37319	he	97	" and you look as though you had not found much rest last night . "
37371	37389	37391	37391	Undine	143	" I had not to sit up last night ; Mr. Barnacles left only early this morning , "
37393	37434	37443	37443	Undine	143	" So I heard just now . Would n't you allow me to send some one to sleep here ? You have no man about the place , and it is a long way to the village to the doctor . "
37435	37441	37443	37443	Undine	143	" No , thank you , "
37454	37466	37443	37443	Undine	143	" You are very good , but we require no one . "
37467	37489	37493	37493	she	143	" I am sure you will feel very lonely . Wo n't you let me leave Prince to keep you company ? "
37501	37507	37509	37509	Undine	143	" He would not stay , "
37513	37523	37532	37532	his	1052	" He will do just as I tell him , "
37535	37542	37532	37532	his	1052	" Here Prince , lie down ! "
37576	37580	37598	37598	Undine	143	" Lie down ! "
37581	37596	37598	37598	Undine	143	" Poor old fellow ! It 's very cruel of me to keep you , "
37619	37687	37598	37598	Undine	143	" I 'm very cruel , but I am so lonely , and I love nothing , nothing at all . I thought I loved my books and nature , but now I find I do n't care anything , even for them . O Prince , I wish I were you ! I do n't want to be loved ; I only want to love something . "
37989	38006	38008	38011	a voice beside her	1177	" You seem to find something very absorbing in the contemplation of the fire this evening , "
38029	38035	38036	38036	she	143	" You quite startled me , "
38039	38055	38036	38036	she	143	" I did not think you would come tonight ; it is getting almost dark . "
38056	38067	38008	38011	a voice beside her	1177	" Yes ; we have the promise of a heavy fall of
38070	38088	38036	38036	she	143	" he said , as he seated himself in an armchair on the other side of the fire .
38089	38110	38111	38111	he	1052	" You can have no idea what a charming picture this room makes , coming in from the cold outside , "
38137	38147	38149	38149	Undine	143	" You must take him home with you tonight , "
38151	38174	38149	38149	Undine	143	" I am not going to be so cruel as to keep him here any longer ; and you must miss him . "
38175	38196	38198	38203	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" No , I never miss him . You had better keep him if he is any pleasure to you , "
38223	38233	38220	38220	he	1052	" Do you never wish to return to Africa ? "
38234	38237	38238	38238	she	143	" No , "
38241	38270	38271	38271	He	1052	" I know no one there . My stepfather has remarried . But I should like to see the old farm and my little monkey 's grave again . "
38302	38313	38299	38299	she	143	" Yes , he was the best friend I had . "
38330	38342	38319	38319	he	1052	" I have a favour to ask of you , Miss Bock .
38343	38349	38350	38350	he	1052	" You rather puzzle me , "
38353	38381	38350	38350	he	1052	" I never feel sure I understand you , and I do most men . At times I form an opinion of you , at times another , but
38415	38415	38393	38393	you	1180	"
38416	38429	38387	38387	I	0	" Why do you not put some other word in the place of "
38433	38437	38387	38387	I	0	" pernicious , √≠ "
38447	38502	38443	38443	you	1052	" she replied , using a freer speech with him than ever before , for in the firelight the bands of speech are loosed and the tongues of men and women do wonders . He never paid her compliments or spoke to her as he would to another woman , so he answered quietly , "
38515	38597	38600	38600	they	1181	" Another making this remark would have been answered by a contemptuous silence ; or at best she would have launched out into a denunciation of that singular injustice which cramps and dwarfs a woman 's mind , making it an unpardonable offence against her womanhood to entertain a thought or give utterance to an idea that has not been repeated and re≈Ωchoed till it is as stale and unpalatable as a last year 's loaf . Tonight she only said : "
38615	38615	38605	38605	your	1052	"
38616	38627	38628	38628	he	1052	" You are asking me a question hard to answer , "
38642	38658	38628	38628	he	1052	" A woman to be womanly should have nothing striking or peculiar about her ; she should
38739	38739	38744	38744	he	1052	"
38889	38897	38899	38904	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" You have not yet answered me , "
38916	38925	38899	38904	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" Are you going to satisfy my curiosity ? "
38960	39003	39004	39004	Undine	143	" Nothing ! And you have lived for sixteen years and in two continents , and certainly are not troubled with lack of ideas . You must excuse me , however . I have no right to press you in this way . "
39324	39347	39348	39348	he	97	" Your life has been lonely ; no one has understood you ; you may have had no one to guide you , "
39367	39381	39348	39348	he	97	" Will you let me be your friend and take care of you ? "
39394	39401	39402	39402	he	97	" Come to me , darling , "
39483	39504	39505	39505	he	97	" Why do you lie so quietly , darling ? Why do you not tell me that you love me ? "
39536	39549	39550	39550	he	97	" Are you not going to kiss me , my little girl ? "
39577	39594	39595	39595	he	97	" Did you ever care about anyone before you loved me ? Did you , darling ? "
39624	39627	39621	39621	She	1204	" No . "
39628	39648	39621	39621	She	1204	" You could talk so well a little time ago , and now you can hardly get out one little "
39662	39663	39654	39654	you	1204	" "
39675	39702	39654	39654	you	1204	" she said , holding his face between her two hands and putting her cheek softly against his ; then she nestled close to him again . "
39708	39709	39704	39704	you	97	" "
39712	39712	39704	39704	you	97	"
39713	39730	39739	39739	he	97	" How astonished everyone will be when they hear who is to be my little wife , "
39807	39819	39820	39820	he	97	" Undine , I want you to do something for me , "
39828	39843	39820	39820	he	97	" I know you will do whatever I tell you . Will you not ? "
39844	39847	39848	39848	she	1218	" Yes , "
39857	39913	39848	39848	she	1218	" You must not spend so much time over your books as you have done . I would rather you left them alone altogether . You must give two or three hours a day to your music , and learn dancing . I want my wife to be deficient in nothing . Do you hear ? "
39967	39978	39979	39979	he	97	" Why do you tremble so , my little darling ? "
39992	40070	39979	39979	he	97	" I must go now , but I will come again early tomorrow . How cold your little hands are . Warm them by the fire and then go to bed . Now you belong to me , I do n't want you to have dark rings round your eyes , as though you had sat up all night . My wife must be always bright and beautiful , you know . Good - night , darling . "
40186	40189	40202	40202	he	97	" UNDINE , "
40218	40234	40202	40202	he	97	" did that little old cousin of yours never try to make love to you ? "
40235	40238	40240	40240	Undine	143	" No , "
40347	40407	40343	40343	he	97	" I am glad to hear it ; I have a greater respect for my old pedagogue than for almost any man I know , but I had an idea from the way he sometimes spoke of you that he cared rather more for you than a second cousin 's husband generally does . I am glad it was fancy .
40421	40426	40408	40408	I	0	" And he was gone .
40580	40585	40575	40575	she	143	" Is it right ? "
40589	40596	40575	40575	she	143	" Will he think it right ? "
40597	40605	40606	40606	she	143	" This afternoon I will tell him , "
40622	40631	40606	40606	she	143	" I wish he had never asked me . "
40679	40686	40666	40666	she	143	" I told you a lie . "
40715	40742	40743	40743	she	143	" I will tell him tomorrow , some day when he loves me better , when he understands me , when I am his little wife , "
40827	40839	40849	40849	he	1228	" I am afraid I made a great fool of myself , "
40857	40911	40849	40849	he	1228	" No other woman ever made me lose my head , but I do believe the little creature bewitched me that night with her sentimental talk . She loves me , I can do anything with her , I shall make something of her in time ; but I was a great fool . "
40912	40919	40920	40920	he	1228	" What are you doing here ? "
40970	40982	40983	40983	he	1228	" You know I do not like your wandering about alone , "
41008	41025	41026	41026	she	1233	" I would not have come if I had thought you would not like me to , "
41035	41045	41026	41026	she	1233	" I want you to go to church tomorrow , "
41054	41086	41026	41026	she	1233	" Your cousin is better ; you will be able to go , will you not ? You will have to go some day ; I would rather you began now . "
41093	41102	41089	41089	I	0	" she answered after a moment 's pause . "
41113	41122	41089	41089	I	0	" continued the Piece - of - perfection , "
41153	41179	41145	41146	a woman	374	" Undine had now heard this remark so often that she had no new reply to make to it , and walked on in silence . "
41189	41190	41181	41181	you	0	" "
41197	41201	41181	41181	you	0	" she said . "
41208	41209	41204	41204	you	0	" "
41249	41250	41246	41246	I	0	" "
41260	41268	41251	41251	You	0	" she said , pulling it off quickly .
41269	41274	41275	41275	he	0	" I hope not , "
41280	41317	41275	41275	he	0	" There are few things which I admire less than a slovenly woman . If a woman cares to retain the affection of those about her , she will always be particular as to her dress . "
41318	41330	41332	41332	Undine	143	" So that others might love her dress , not herself , "
41334	41355	41356	41356	he	0	" I will care for my wife just as long as she gives me reason to be proud of her , "
41361	41373	41356	41356	he	0	" Just as you do for your horses and your dog ? "
41374	41407	41408	41408	He	0	" Yes ; I believe I care for that dog as well as for most things ; but if he became disobedient or vicious , I should care nothing more about him . "
41493	41522	41481	41481	she	143	" What causes you always to move your hand in that extraordinary manner whenever you are angry ? It is not very pretty , I can assure you . "
41523	41534	41481	41481	she	143	" I am not angry ; I was only thinking . "
41535	41538	41573	41573	I	0	" What ? "
41539	41555	41481	41481	she	143	" That I will try and be everything you wish . Do you believe me ? "
41556	41566	41573	41573	I	0	" If I did not believe that you would try and
41583	41587	41588	41588	You	143	" he replied . "
41601	41601	41588	41588	You	143	"
41659	41708	41650	41650	she	143	" You know that if ever , at any moment , at any time , you change and would rather not marry me , if it were the very day before our wedding you must feel quite free you must tell me so it will be all right . "
41709	41717	41718	41718	he	0	" Are you changing your mind already ? "
41726	41734	41735	41735	she	143	" No , I shall never change , "
41738	41772	41735	41735	she	143	" Nor am I in the habit of retracing my steps , either ; but it is certainly better , if one does repent , to do so before it is too late . "
41787	41805	41807	41807	Undine	143	" Are you not going to come in and see my cousin today ? She is up , "
42012	42027	42028	42028	he	0	" Be sure you practise this evening ; you are my own little darling , "
42040	42072	42028	42028	he	0	" Do n't sit up too late , and look as pretty and as sweet when I come tomorrow as you do now . Good - night , my little girl . "
42416	42425	42427	42428	that lady	638	" It 's just another of her freaks , "
42442	42487	42430	42431	Miss Mell	91	" No one could have been more kindly treated than she had been here ; quite spoiled in fact . There is no telling what she will take into her head next . I wish her grandmother joy of her , I 'm sure . "
42488	42515	42517	42518	Miss Mell	91	" Do n't you think Harry Blair 's going away so suddenly , without making her an offer , may have something to do with it ? "
42529	42577	42517	42518	Miss Mell	91	" I am sure from what I have seen that she could have had him at any time she chose , but you will not mention it to anyone , I know his father has quarrelled with him and will have nothing more to do with him . "
42578	42585	42587	42588	Miss Mell	91	" Ah , I understand now , "
42590	42693	42587	42588	Miss Mell	91	" that will have put my lady out just a little in her pretty little game . A poor penniless boy is not much of a catch . It serves her right . I always thought it shameful , the way she used to walk about everywhere with him quite alone . I wonder she had not more regard for her character than to act as she did . I would die sooner than be on such intimate terms with a man to whom I was not engaged ; and even then I think a modest reticence so becoming in a woman . "
42713	42718	42720	42721	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Well , anyhow , "
42727	42767	42720	42721	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" I do wish her grandmother joy of her . There is something one ca n't help liking about the girl , but she is so peculiar and eccentric I shall be glad to have her off my hands . "
42768	42782	42784	42785	Miss Mell	91	" Do n't you think she is trying it on in another direction ? "
42804	42825	42827	42828	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" I do n't think she tries it on in any direction ; that is just what I complain of , "
42830	42874	42827	42828	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" From what I know , I am sure she could have had old Blair if she had chosen . He is much older than she is , but a penniless girl ca n't be too fastidious , and he is terribly rich . "
42875	42891	42893	42894	Miss Mell	91	" As to her not trying it on , I do n't know about that , "
42896	42944	42893	42894	Miss Mell	91	" I do n't think she would have said no , if he had given her a chance of saying yes , but perhaps she has higher game in her eye . What do you think some one comes here once and sometimes twice a day for ? "
42945	42970	42972	42973	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Oh , he is polite to all women ; his attentions mean nothing . He will look higher when he chooses a wife , "
43093	43096	43085	43085	she	143	" Good - bye
43100	43114	43085	43085	she	143	" she said , breaking off a bit of its dry frosty bark . "
43176	43176	43197	43197	she	143	"
43307	43339	43300	43300	her	1263	" You are not well my child ; you are lonely ; the place is too quiet for you ; a young life like yours should not be buried away here . "
43394	43422	43423	43425	the old woman	1269	" Why do you never sit by the fire ? It is so cold and cheerless at the window , and there is nothing to be seen , "
43472	43478	43479	43479	she	143	" The child has changed , "
43495	43521	43479	43479	she	143	" She never reads now and thinks only of dress and music ; but I suppose it is natural ; the young will be young . "
43650	43659	43661	43663	the old woman	1269	" What is it ? What has happened ? "
44114	44121	44122	44122	they	1287	" Fool ! fool ! fool ! "
44150	44166	44167	44167	she	143	" O sky , blue cloudless sky , have pity , have pity on me ! "
44350	44359	44360	44360	she	611	" Where have you been , my child ? "
44369	44376	44360	44360	she	611	" Are you not bitterly cold ? "
44377	44380	44382	44382	Undine	143	" No , "
44418	44426	44427	44427	she	611	" You look ill , my child , "
44440	44446	44427	44427	she	611	" I am not ill , "
44450	44486	44427	44427	she	611	" only tired . No , I am not hungry ; I only want to rest . I am tired , very tired . I want no light , thank you . Good - night . "
44721	44736	44737	44737	he	97	" I will run down and see her when I go back to Greenwood , "
44740	44777	44737	44737	he	97	" ' Tis a pity , as things seem to be turning out , that I ever let the poor little thing make such a fool of me , but it ca n't be helped now . "
45059	45087	45088	45091	one of his admirers	1324	" He is so pure , so calm , so transparent . If there were more Christians like him , all the world would soon become Christian , "
45231	45237	45241	45241	his	81	" You have been ill ? "
45307	45315	45316	45316	he	81	" It was exceedingly kind of you , "
45339	45349	45351	45356	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" It is quite unnecessary , I assure you , "
45373	45410	45351	45356	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" You will understand that it is so when I tell you , as perhaps I should have done sooner , that in all probability , e'er very long , Miss Bock will become my wife . "
45445	45452	45454	45455	Cousin Jonathan	81	" You really must excuse me , "
45457	45517	45454	45455	Cousin Jonathan	81	" but I am amazed , astonished ; it is so very , so altogether , unexpected . I you really must excuse me , but I was under the impression that , if ever I had the honour of looking upon any member of your family as the future husband of my charge , it would be another . "
45518	45536	45537	45537	he	874	" I do not imagine Miss Bock ever had any very great regard for my poor brother , "
45554	45565	45454	45455	Cousin Jonathan	81	" Has she not told you ? But of course she will
45575	45579	45454	45455	Cousin Jonathan	81	" said Cousin Jonathan .
45580	45585	45587	45588	Albert Blair	97	" On what subject ? "
45603	45631	45633	45634	Cousin Jonathan	81	" About this affair with your brother ; but of course it is all passed now , and I wish you both every blessing , every happiness , "
45641	45674	45633	45634	Cousin Jonathan	81	" I always understood from Miss Bock that she was perfectly indifferent to my brother , in fact rather repelled than favoured his addresses . I imagine you must have misunderstood her . "
45675	45697	45699	45700	Cousin Jonathan	81	" Oh , yes , and there can be nothing gained by speaking now over things that are past and gone , "
45702	45814	45699	45700	Cousin Jonathan	81	" and I can not tell you how grateful , how relieved , I feel to think that the dear child will be in your care . When she seemed so devotedly attached to your brother , of course I did not like to interfere , but it was , I can assure you it was a cause of great anxiety to me . If she were my own daughter , I could not feel a greater regard for her welfare ; and she is so peculiar , so eccentric , that with all her noble qualities and rich and vigorous intellect she has never been able to get on anywhere . "
45830	45843	45825	45826	Cousin Jonathan	81	" It may seem , and I fear was , very selfish on my
45961	45979	45950	45950	I	0	" said Cousin Jonathan , screwing up the corners of his eyes till they began to look watery .
45994	46060	45986	45991	the Piece - of - perfection	994	" Perhaps I ought to explain to you that what exists between myself and Miss Bock is not a definite engagement . It is an understanding which either party may bring to an end at any time he or she should wish to do so , and it might be just as well to say nothing on the subject till matters are more definitely arranged . "
46061	46071	46073	46074	Cousin Jonathan	81	" Certainly , certainly , if you wish it , "
46076	46148	46073	46074	Cousin Jonathan	81	" but I do hope that matters will soon , very soon , be in that condition . I have often feared that she might be tempted for the sake of wealth and position to give herself away to a man who was utterly unworthy of her . She is so young , and therefore it is only natural that she should desire such things , and having also been brought up in
46168	46168	45986	45991	the Piece - of - perfection	994	"
46169	46197	46199	46200	Albert Blair	97	" I understand that Miss Bock 's family , though not wealthy , was a very respectable one . Take another cigar ; yours has gone out , "
46206	46328	46199	46200	Albert Blair	97	" Oh , I know nothing , nothing whatever , against the character of any of her relations . Her father was a connection of my own , and as far as I am aware his family are all well to do . Of her mother I know nothing . He made a great mistake in marrying her , I believe . She was some woman he picked up in London and who married as her second husband some low farmer at the Cape . Her grandfather got her home when her mother died , but she could not get on with them ; they did not seem to understand the dear child 's little peculiarities and could not appreciate her . "
46504	46510	46511	46511	he	1359	" I feel so sure , "
46514	46586	46588	46590	the little man	874	" that you of all men will be able to overlook any small deficiencies in the dear child , when you consider all the adverse circumstances with which she has had to contend . There is something so original and strong , so noble , in her character , that if she were only a little more open she would be almost perfect in my estimate . Not that I mean , "
46600	46660	46662	46663	Cousin Jonathan	81	" not that I mean to say she is not quite truthful , but she is sometimes not quite so open , as one might expect to find her . Her nature is , I believe , a thoroughly truthful one in every respect , and it is only the effect of early mismanagement . And are we not , "
46671	46701	46667	46667	his	81	" are we not all of us formed during the first few years of our lives ? What is done then , can it ever be undone , ever ? "
46716	46746	46712	46712	he	81	" But it is all right now ; I feel so rejoiced to think that for the future she will be shielded and cared for better than I could care for
46777	46777	46761	46761	I	0	"
46778	46794	46803	46803	he	81	" You 're a very devil of wickedness or a poor fool of a saint , "
46832	46848	46849	46849	he	81	" I may tell Mrs. Barnacles , of of the understanding , may I not ? "
46852	46916	46918	46920	the little man	874	" She has been much grieved at Undine 's sudden freak of leaving us ; and I can not myself understand how the idea came into her head , unless she thought we were imposing on her by leaving her alone with an invalid on her hands . She never told you if that was her reason for leaving us , I suppose ? "
46934	46962	46918	46920	the little man	874	" No ; she told me she was leaving because she was weary of the place and wished for change . You are surely not leaving yet ? "
47349	47356	47357	47357	he	97	" I will write when there , "
47360	47403	47357	47357	he	97	" The little schemer quite deserves to be kept waiting , and it gives her more time to forget me . They may say what they like , but I do believe the little devil likes me or at least my prospects . "
47415	47437	47412	47413	Miss Undine	143	" said Nancy , her grandmother 's maid , as she stood chatting with her lover over the gate one evening . "
47596	47597	47598	47598	Nancy	67	" "
47611	47618	47602	47602	she	67	" you can take all these things.√≠ "
47619	47630	47602	47602	she	67	" Lor ' ! Miss Undine , √≠ says I , "
47635	47636	47661	47661	she	143	" "
47646	47651	47644	47644	she	143	" and if you do n't
47765	47765	47757	47757	he	145	"
47766	47774	47776	47777	her lover	3435	" And did you get the dresses ? "
47779	47784	47786	47786	Nancy	67	" Course I did , "
47788	47837	47786	47786	Nancy	67	" and other things too . And Miss Undine she just goes on walking about in that ' ere sort of a way . Lor ' ! and she is queer sometimes ; she takes a cloth and begins rubbing down the chairs and things in the parlour . "
47848	47849	47847	47847	I.	0	" "
47891	47892	47864	47864	she	143	" "
47911	47912	47916	47916	she	143	" "
47995	48002	47987	47987	she	143	" said the puzzled Nancy , emphatically .
48061	48072	48056	48056	she	67	" No , I am well only tired rather tired . "
48073	48122	48126	48126	herself	67	" The flowers of last year , when their stalks grew hollow and empty , fell to the ground , to give place and food to the fresh green shoots of this year ; then why must we live on , when we are tired , so tired ? "
48371	48378	48379	48379	she	67	" Why should I spoil it ? "
48464	48502	48503	48503	she	67	" I can not help it it is not cowardly I am too tired so tired . He does not want me any more . There is nothing in the world , and I am so weary , "
48518	48530	48503	48503	she	67	" I shall never trouble him any more , down there . "
48994	49032	49034	49036	the good Nancy	1425	" Lor ' ! Miss Undine , you 'll catch your death of cold ; the dew 's a - falling already , and there 's a gentleman in the parlour a - wanting to see you , "
49112	49122	49123	49123	he	486	" This is indeed a great and unexpected pleasure , "
49139	49183	49123	49123	he	486	" a great and most unexpected pleasure . I have been in the neighbourhood for some days , engaged in inspecting a large estate I have just purchased , and it was by the merest chance that I heard of your being here . "
49229	49237	49238	49238	she	143	" Have you been to Greenwood lately ? "
49241	49247	49238	49238	she	143	" Not since the autumn . "
49256	49277	49284	49284	he	486	" I have been hoping continually to hear from you since that time , but have been always disappointed hitherto . "
49297	49341	49284	49284	he	486	" I trust I need hardly tell you , my dear Miss Bock , that in the months that have passed I have not changed in my feelings or wishes . What I then asked , I still most earnestly and truly desire . "
49373	49383	49365	49365	She	143	" I know nothing of Master Harry 's whereabouts , "
49387	49498	49500	49502	the old man	624	" and as for his brother , I will know nothing . He has gone in for all manner of mad speculations without my knowledge or advise , and of course has got into trouble and expects my help now . He shall not have it , though . I shall have as little to do with him as with his brother for the future . If he wants help he may go to his aristocratic relations , who , if they were sold up , blue blood and all , could not raise the sum he wants . I could let him have the money and never miss it , "
49507	49527	49500	49502	the old man	624	" but he has seen the shine of my cash for the last time , I can assure him . "
49773	49809	49816	49816	her	143	" You asked me once long ago to become your wife . I told you then that it could never be ; but I am willing now if you will give me what I want . "
49839	49897	49835	49835	she	143	" If you will settle on me , before our marriage , fifty thousand pounds in cash , to be mine absolutely , to do exactly as I please with , then I will marry you as soon as you wish . I do not love you , but I will be a good wife to you . "
49936	49964	49910	49911	Many women	1034	" I do not love you , but you will have no reason to repent marrying me if you are willing to do so on my terms . "
50019	50055	50015	50015	he	624	" Not only what you ask , but everything I have , shall be yours ; though of course if you wish it , an arrangement such as that which you mention shall be made . "
50277	50284	50286	50287	Miss Mell	91	" Did I not say so ? "
50312	50347	50306	50306	she	91	" She was not half the poor little fool you all thought her ; she understood her game when she let the son slip to catch the father ; she knew where the meat lay .
50348	50357	50359	50360	Miss Mell	91	" She has a nice nest of it , "
50362	50398	50359	50360	Miss Mell	91	" The old man is too stout and apoplectic to last long , and the sons are both in his bad books , where you may be sure she will take good care to keep them .
50432	50439	50440	50444	a widow with her thousands	1462	" continued the poor little woman , "
50456	50456	50440	50444	a widow with her thousands	1462	"
50526	50542	50543	50543	he	81	" She could never have cared for him or she could not have done this , "
50546	50563	50543	50543	he	81	" To marry for money and so soon : she could never have cared for him . "
50604	50613	50614	50614	he	97	" What a merciful escape I have had ! "
50748	50764	50765	50765	he	97	" There is nothing worth loving , nothing true , nothing noble in the world , "
50827	50834	50835	50835	he	97	" O God , my God ! "
50849	50868	50835	50835	he	97	" and this is the woman whom I have allowed to come in between my soul and Thee . "
51091	51101	51136	51136	him	1482	" Dinner is ready and my master is waiting , "
51115	51126	51127	51127	she	143	" Say I am ill today and can not come , "
51228	51244	51222	51223	her husband	1482	" Is my little pet ill this evening ? What is the matter with her ? "
51279	51287	51289	51291	the little man	874	" What do you mean by this ? "
51687	51698	51699	51699	she	143	" I shall never be able to live in Greenwood , "
51714	51725	51726	51726	he	874	" You never ask me to do anything for you , "
51731	51737	51726	51726	he	874	" Ask me for something . "
51886	51909	51914	51914	himself	1516	" She is a cold , dull , heartless little creature in whom nothing can awaken the faintest spark of womanly emotion , "
52023	52049	52051	52052	the women	1520	" She dresses well and knows how to make herself look beautiful , but that is the only thing she has sense enough to understand , "
52154	52160	52162	52162	she	67	" And , Lor ' ! "
52179	52236	52162	52162	she	67	" I did not know Miss Undine : she 's grown so beautiful and dresses so grand ; it kind of took my breath away to look at her . Then I just remembered how she used to lie under them old trees in the garden and rub down them chairs , and so I says , "
52293	52294	52301	52301	she	143	" "

52385	52405	52379	52379	mum	1527	" we could never have a house like that ; it 's worlds too grand for the likes of us.√≠ "
52406	52413	52434	52434	she	1527	" Well , √≠ says she , "
52436	52448	52434	52434	she	1527	" and I 'll see that you get work whenever you want it.√≠

52484	52554	52482	52482	she	1527	" but the housekeeper asked me to let a woman stay in the little shed outside the garden ; you must not trouble her , √≠ says she , and goes on reading as though there were n't no one in the room . My head was all of a - whirl like , so I just says thank you , mum , and walks out of the room . "
52914	52919	52921	52921	Undine	143	" Do not rise , "
52923	52933	52921	52921	Undine	143	" the bench is large enough for us both . "

53070	53077	53079	53080	the woman	837	" No . I have him , "
53096	53112	53118	53118	she	837	" Having him , how can I be lonely ? How can I want anything ? "
53126	53143	53145	53145	Undine	143	" Do you not feel very lonely , living here so far from all other houses ? "
53152	53155	53157	53158	the woman	837	" No , "
53162	53167	53157	53158	the woman	837	" I like it . "
53286	53299	53300	53300	she	143	" One kiss , for the sake of your bonny blue eyes , "

53418	53439	53446	53446	he	1566	" Where have you been all day ? Not climbing the hills and over - exerting yourself , I hope ? "

53724	53730	53731	53731	she	143	" Behind no prison gate , "
53734	53753	53731	53731	she	143	" That slurs the sunshine half a mile , Are captives so uncomforted As souls behind a smile . "

54209	54223	54201	54201	You	223	" Then there came words Undine did not catch , and then again : "
54310	54310	54295	54295	You	223	"
54394	54403	54404	54404	she	143	" I hope I have not frightened you , "

55613	55660	55610	55610	Nancy	67	" Well , this morning , afore ever the sun got up , I went to the cottage to have a look at them shutters which we forgot to shut after we had been a - cleaning up last night and which I thought as how the wind

55826	55875	55824	55824	Nancy	67	" Nobody ca n't give no reason for her goings - on . I would n't be in no ways surprised to hear she 'd been and gone and drunk poison , or gone up in a balloon , or been a - doing anything unlike other folks . "
55876	55904	55905	55905	Mother	149	" Well , I went and called mother and we seed to the baby : and the prettiest fattest little thing I ever seed , it was . "

56073	56076	56070	56071	her lover	3435	" Money ? "
56077	56080	56082	56082	Nancy	67	" Money ? "
56084	56153	56082	56082	Nancy	67	" No . I just opened it afore I thought , and what do you think I seed in it ? Why , the likeness of the beautifullest young man I ever set eyes on in all my born days . The man on the hairpin box ai n't nothing to him , nothing . Curly hair and moustaches just the same , but a sight more handsome . "

56193	56228	56191	56191	Nancy	67	" ' cept a couple of bits of cigars , half burnt out , and an old glove a sight too big for her I should say , though she is pretty considerable big . "
56229	56249	56082	56082	Nancy	67	" What did she say when she came back and found you 'd been a rummaging all her things ? "
56250	56259	56261	56261	Nancy	67	" Comed back ! She never comed back , "
56263	56319	56261	56261	Nancy	67	" and it 's my belief she never will neither . She 's come from nowheres and she 's gone to nowheres . She thinks as how other folks can see to its burying , but it 's always the way with the likes of her . Women that do the sort of thing she 's been
56332	56344	56325	56325	they	1635	" said the virtuous Nancy . And her lover agreed with her .
56345	56357	56359	56360	the swain	1636	" Did you tell Mrs. Blair about her never coming back ? "
56362	56376	56378	56378	Nancy	67	" Well , that 's what I 'm just a - coming to , "
56380	56387	56378	56378	Nancy	67	" At four o'clock I says ; "
56394	56418	56392	56392	I	0	" had n't I better be going down to Mrs. Blair 's just for to tell her that the woman has n't come ? "

56443	56452	56439	56439	I	0	" Ca n't I see the mistress?√≠ says I. "

56462	56467	56431	56431	mother	1559	" Know what?√≠ says I. "
56468	56486	56439	56439	I	0	" That she 's a - dying , and the baby , too , √≠ says he . "
56487	56493	56431	56431	mother	1559	" Baby , √≠ says I. "
56501	56502	56507	56508	the housemaid	1640	" "
56515	56541	56507	56508	the housemaid	1640	" she was took ill this morning , and the baby ai n't much bigger nor your hand and more like a rat nor a baby.√≠ "
56554	56555	56551	56552	the nurse	1641	" "
56562	56563	56561	56561	I.	0	" "
56575	56599	56572	56573	the nurse	1641	" but she 's asking after somebody . I ca n't hear the name very clear , but I think it 's Nancy Grey.√≠ "
56600	56609	56572	56573	the nurse	1641	" If it is , √≠ says I , "
56622	56648	56649	56649	her	150	" The room was so dark I could see nothing at first , but , Lor ' ! when I did it was awful sad to see
56710	56732	56697	56698	the nurse	1641	" Take it away , take it away!√≠ she cries out , quite strong like , and then I comed out . "
56733	56746	56748	56750	Nancy 's lover	1646	" And what are you going to do with the other baby ? "
56752	56761	56763	56763	Nancy	67	" Have it buried , to be sure , "
56765	56778	56763	56763	Nancy	67	" Mr. Blair he 'll pay for it if she 's dead . "
57109	57124	57126	57126	Undine	143	" I think I shall sleep . I do n't want to be disturbed , "
57412	57417	57418	57418	she	143	" Poor little soul , "
57426	57447	57418	57418	she	143	" life is too wonderful to hate in . Poor little soul , we are all too nearly bound for hating "
57488	57495	57496	57496	he	1482	" Why do you do that ? "
57505	57515	57516	57517	his wife	243	" Because I am going to call her Violet , "
57892	57897	57898	57898	she	143	" My little friend , "
57923	57932	57898	57898	she	143	" My little friend , who loves me . "
57933	57948	57949	57949	they	1692	" Some one ought to tell her ; she does not dream of it , "
57953	57970	57971	57972	The doctor	3282	" She will wake up some morning and find the child lying dead in her arms . "
58112	58160	58161	58161	she	143	" She is so fond of flowers , and does not tear them to pieces as other children do . She holds them so carefully in her hand and turns them round and looks at them . We do n't give babies credit for half wisdom enough , "
58164	58171	58173	58174	the doctor	3282	" It is growing very thin , "
58185	58189	58173	58174	the doctor	3282	" very thin . "
58190	58197	58199	58199	Undine	143	" Not thinner than it was , "
58201	58223	58199	58199	Undine	143	" and when next summer comes we will go to the sea ; it will soon be strong and well then . "
58224	58233	58235	58236	the doctor	3282	" That is a long time to wait , "
58240	58250	58235	58236	the doctor	3282	" Many things may have happened before next summer . "
58278	58284	58275	58275	she	143	" What do you mean ? "
58314	58321	58322	58322	she	143	" Oh , my little friend , "
58325	58380	58322	58322	she	143	" is it to be always so ? Are we only to lift our heads above the water to be pushed down again ? Do we only rise up because , if we did not , we could not be flung down to earth ? Is light only sent to make the darkness visible ? "
58407	58487	58514	58515	her husband	1482	" My little friend , I am very cruel to wish to keep you . Would life have more of happiness for you than it has had for me ? a little gladness out of colours and lights ; a little sweetness out of dreams ; one hour of bliss looking at footmarks in the white snow ? Is that enough to make it worth keeping ? Oh , my little friend , it will be better to go . You
58505	58505	58535	58535	he	1482	"
58506	58512	58514	58515	her husband	1482	" Not in bed yet ? "
58554	58587	58535	58535	he	1482	" You might as well have gone with me if you meant to sit up so late . You will never get your roses back if you go on in this way . "
58596	58613	58535	58535	he	1482	" she said , quietly , smoothing softly the crumples in the child 's little nightdress . "
58619	58620	58535	58535	he	1482	" "
58628	58641	58535	58535	he	1482	" he said , peering down into its face for a moment . "
58662	58663	58666	58666	he	1708	" "
58687	58688	58666	58666	he	1708	" "
58716	58732	58754	58754	herself	1556	" responded her master , sullenly , as he turned away and left the room . "
58759	58763	58754	58754	herself	1556	" he grumbled . "
58785	58785	58779	58779	She	1711	"
59153	59158	59159	59159	she	143	" It is dead , "
59179	59184	59159	59159	she	143	" It is asleep . "
59296	59306	59308	59309	Miss Mell	91	" You have heard the news , of course , "
59337	59374	59376	59377	Miss Mell	91	" Harry Blair has come . I saw him myself half an hour ago , and he says his father is dead . Did you ever hear of such a thing ? Some people are lucky , "
59381	59400	59308	59309	Miss Mell	91	" Why , I do n't think he will get much . Did his father leave him anything ? "
59401	59506	59531	59531	she	96	" Leave him anything ! Of course he did n't . You may be sure she would take good care of that . I can see it now just as well as if it were past how she 'll come here lording it over everybody and marrying a big swell before the year 's out . With all her money and her bold , free manners , men are sure to be taken by her . I am sure she has no good looks to talk of , but they are such fools they never see it . They are so easily taken in . "
59507	59525	59527	59528	Mrs. Barnacles	96	" Even if they are , I do n't wonder that you never managed to do it , "
59535	59584	59531	59531	she	96	" I do n't know anything about her . I 've never heard her mentioned since her baby died two years ago . I 've never had but two notes from her since she left . Gratitude was and never will be one of Undine Blair 's virtues . "
59760	59784	59716	59716	her	91	" Do come in , Mr. Barnacles . You 've heard the news , no doubt ; perhaps you 've seen Mr. Blair ? "
59785	59821	59716	59716	her	91	" Yes , he called on me as soon as he arrived . He was on the Continent when he got the news of his father 's illness , and came to find him dead . "
59822	59834	59836	59837	Miss Mell	91	" Poor fellow ! Did he really expect to get anything ? "
59850	59884	59836	59837	Miss Mell	91	" No ; he was astonished when he got home to find that the property was to be divided equally between the two brothers . He had no idea of any such thing . "
59885	59894	59896	59897	Miss Mell	91	" So the old man left her nothing ? "
59899	59902	59896	59897	Miss Mell	91	" No , "
59907	59951	59896	59897	Miss Mell	91	" he left her everything , but she 's gone off , nobody knows where , and has left an order that everything is to be divided between them . Harry Blair has come here to enquire whether I know anything about her . "
59952	59966	59968	59969	Miss Mell	91	" I should say the best thing would be to let her alone , "
59971	59986	59968	59969	Miss Mell	91	" she has evidently got some nice little game of her own to play . "
60280	60287	60288	60288	he	81	" I am growing too studious , "
60291	60312	60288	60288	he	81	" my nerves are debilitated , seriously debilitated . I must take a tonic . I must take a walk . "
60374	60389	60390	60390	he	81	" She was not so evil as they thought her , not so mercenary , "
61073	61076	61061	61071	small game , however puny , white - faced young Londoners	1778	" raw Englishmen "

61366	61379	61363	61364	her sister	3227	" It belongs to that lady in the black - silk dress . "
61380	61395	61397	61399	the little one	1800	" No , it does n't , or I would not have kicked it , "
61401	61417	61397	61399	the little one	1800	" it belongs to that woman with the plaited hair and the old grey frock . "
61418	61427	61429	61430	the elder	1801	" Oh , then it 's all right , "

61719	61731	61733	61742	a gentleman standing in earshot of Undine to his companion	1810	" I wonder who that woman in the grey dress is , "
61760	61794	61733	61742	a gentleman standing in earshot of Undine to his companion	1810	" Woman in grey dress ? I saw one just now . Deuced pretty little thing . Tried to get up a conversation ; could n't . Best - looking thing on board . "
61795	61805	61807	61808	his companion	1364	" Then she 's not the woman I mean , "
61810	61829	61807	61808	his companion	1364	" She 's not your style , would not exactly attract you , but she has marvellous eyes . "
61830	61834	61836	61837	the captain	1814	" Who has ? "
61880	61891	61892	61892	she	1815	" I ca n't say that I admire your taste , "
61908	61973	61892	61892	she	1815	" A living song they are , you say ? You who have so much of the poet 's blood should really try and translate them into something intelligible to us poor mortals who see nothing in her but a piece of very shabby gentility . You poets should not absorb all the light that falls on you without reflecting a ray on us . "
61974	61993	61994	61994	he	1819	" I 'm afraid it takes more to make a poet than nature has poured into my mould , "
62267	62278	62280	62280	Undine	143	" You are very good to me , very good , "
62296	62310	62285	62286	the woman	837	" You do everything for me so much better than the stewardess can . "
62311	62319	62321	62322	the woman	837	" I ought to be able to , "
62330	62344	62321	62322	the woman	837	" I have been nursing for twelve years . I do nothing else . "
62525	62533	62535	62536	the woman	837	" Are you going to some one ? "
62539	62545	62547	62547	Undine	143	" Going to some one ? "
62550	62558	62560	62561	the woman	837	" Yes . I beg your pardon , "
62573	62600	62560	62561	the woman	837	" I hope you will forgive me . But I meant you looked so happy and I I thought you must be going to some one . "
62601	62612	62614	62614	Undine	143	" No , I have no one to go to , "
62616	62623	62614	62614	Undine	143	" Are you going to friends ? "
62624	62627	62629	62630	the woman	837	" Yes , "
62658	62668	62669	62669	she	143	" Where are the friends you are going to ? "
62687	62698	62682	62682	she	837	" I have one ; I am going to him . "
62707	62712	62682	62682	she	837	" He is dead . "
62801	62826	62827	62827	she	143	" Would you like me to read aloud to you a little ? You must grow so tired of sitting here always and sewing , "
62830	62834	62836	62837	the woman	837	" Thank you , "
62853	62872	62836	62837	the woman	837	" Long ago I used to like books ; they said it was that made me so stupid . "
62873	62879	62881	62881	Undine	143	" How could that be ? "
62894	62929	62836	62837	the woman	837	" I do n't know , but I never could learn , and I used to sit in the window in the moonlight reading the books I liked ; and they said it was that made

62972	62987	62989	62989	Undine	143	" Reading makes no one stupid . They must be strange to say so , "
62991	63080	63081	63081	She	143	" I do n't know . You see , I could only remember poems and tales , I could n't do sums or remember the tables ; I was very stupid , but I understood some of them ; Shelley was the name of one man I used to like , but I did not understand him ; I only felt sorry for him . It was wicked , I know , but I used to wish I could have seen him . I used to like him . "
63106	63115	63117	63117	Undine	143	" I do n't think he was wicked , "
63119	63131	63117	63117	Undine	143	" It is so long ago , perhaps I have forgotten . "
63132	63163	63096	63096	she	143	" I do n't know , but I thought he and his wife went away from each other , and I thought he loved another woman ; but I forget . "
63164	63214	63216	63216	Undine	143	" He did love another woman , but I do n't think that that 's any reason for not liking him . It 's always right to love , love as much as we can , and as long as we can , and as strong as we can , "
63273	63280	63281	63281	she	143	" Do you really believe it ? "
63284	63289	63281	63281	she	143	" Say it again . "
63290	63294	63296	63296	Undine	143	" Say what ? "
63314	63321	63322	63322	she	143	" That it is not wrong , "
63325	63365	63322	63322	she	143	" Not wrong to do what ? Not wrong to love ? How can it be ? It is not wrong to feel warm or to feel strong , and we can as little help loving as feeling either . "
63366	63374	63376	63377	the woman	837	" But if it hurts other people , "
63380	63402	63376	63377	the woman	837	" Then it must be silent as the dead are , who they say live , yet we never hear them . "
63462	63467	63468	63468	she	143	" Look at it , "
63471	63497	63468	63468	she	143	" I never felt so before but I would like to tell you . I never felt so before but I would like to tell . "
63674	63680	63681	63681	she	837	" I was always stupid , "
63684	63840	63681	63681	she	837	" I think that must have been the reason why no one ever loved me . They sent me to school when I was quite a little child to see if it would do me any good , but I used to get so frightened I could never remember when we had to come up and say our lessons , and so I always stayed in the classes with the little girls . I think they used to like me , the very little ones ; I could dress their dolls and even help them with their lessons a little . You see , I was not stupid to them , but to the big girls , and they could not bear me , but they used to let me darn their stockings for them and , when any of them got into a scrape , then they used to come to me and say , "
63864	63971	63972	63972	I	0	" And I used to say yes , because I thought it would make them love me ; but it never did , it only made the teachers hate me . One of them I thought liked me , she always talked so softly to me ; but one day when I was shut up all alone in the dark room that opened out of the schoolroom , I heard some of the teachers talking . I think they had forgotten me and I heard them say I was the stupidest girl in the school and that they could not think how she could like me . "
63978	63982	63972	63972	I	0	" she said , "
64010	64087	63999	64008	not a girl in the school I care less about	1863	" Then I lay down and cried . I had been so happy when I thought she loved me , and when I came out the girls all laughed at me because I had been crying , and said I was afraid of the dark ; and I was not afraid at all , I liked it , but I did so want some one to help me , some one bigger and cleverer than I was .
64088	64113	64186	64186	I	0	" Afterwards , when I grew a great girl , I left off trying to make people love me , because it was no use .
64114	64183	63999	64008	not a girl in the school I care less about	1863	" I used to get away from the others whenever I had time and sit and read all by myself . I had not many books , only some books of poetry and a tale called The Wide Wide World , and some other little books that I forget , but I read them over and over till I could repeat them by heart . I do n't know how
64210	64334	64521	64521	she	1865	" When I was grown and wore long dresses my mother died , and my father a little time after , so I had to go away from school , and I had nothing and no one to go to except one aunt . She had a beautiful little house close to the sea , with a balcony and a flower garden in front , with little white gravelled paths , and she and her three little children lived there alone . I thought I would be so happy there and make her love me , and I thought I would not read my books any more , because they said it was that made me so stupid that no one could like me .
64335	64510	64521	64521	she	1865	" When I came there she gave me a pretty little green - and - white room all to myself , and she told me I should only have to teach the eldest two children and help her a little with her needlework ; but I would make her love me if I worked very hard and tried to do everything I could for her . So I used to get up very early and help the nurse to dress the children and the cook to get the breakfast , and I used to work all day and late in the evening . When the children were in bed I used to get out the needlework ; and when she used to ask me if I was not tired yet , I used to say no , though sometimes I was so tired when I went up to my room I used just to lie across the foot of my bed and cry for tiredness till I went to sleep . I knew it was very
64640	64684	64616	64616	she	1865	" At last one day she told me she was expecting visitors ; a friend of hers and her husband and child were coming to board with us for six months , because she was very delicate and wanted to be near the sea .
64685	64832	64852	64852	I	0	" I was half sorry and half glad when I heard it . It would give me more work , but then I always fancied , before I saw people , that perhaps they would like me and not find me so dull as all the others had . By and by they came . She was a pretty woman and used to sit in the parlour all day , making wax flowers and baskets . My aunt used to sit and talk with her , but she never took any notice of me , even when I put fresh flowers on her table or brought her pretty seaweeds for her baskets ; and her husband I was very frightened of . I could not bear him . He used to sit in an armchair on the balcony just before the schoolroom window all day , and I
64949	65107	65110	65110	he	1877	" After that , early in the mornings , when I used to walk on the beach with the children and his little girl , he would often meet us when he was coming back from his bath and stand and talk to his little girl and sometimes to me . I wondered he did not mind being seen talking to me by the other gentlemen who went past us , because I always had my aunt 's baby and looked like a nurse girl . I thought it was very kind of him , but I did not like him and I was afraid of him . I went round another way when I saw him coming . He always talked so kindly to me . He said my arms were not strong enough to carry such a big baby , and he asked me if I was not tired . No one else ever did . "
65160	65161	65142	65142	he	1877	" "
65172	65178	65169	65169	he	1877	" Because it was like you.√≠ "
65242	65491	65235	65235	he	1877	" I pulled my hands out of his and ran away to the children 's room and knelt down by my bed and cried , I was so happy . I never thought anyone would look at me like that , and all the day I was so glad ; I never felt tired or miserable . In the evening two or three gentlemen came to play whist with him , and my aunt told me to make some eggflip for them . He had showed me how to make them before and I could make them very nicely , but this evening he came into the dining - room just as I had finished , because he said he was afraid I would not do it right . We were all alone , and as he went out of the room he put his arm so softly round me and kissed my mouth . It seemed as if there were a great river running past my ears , and I sat down and put my head on the table . I did not think there was any wrong in it ; I did not think at all . It was all so strange , and I was so happy . I did not think that day or for many days after . I had no time to think . You see , I was working , working all the time with the children or at housework , from early
65715	65834	65835	65835	he	1895	" Just as I was thinking so , I saw him standing in the door . He had gone with the others to church ; I do n't know how it was he came back . He came into the room and stooped down over me and asked me what I was thinking of . Then I told him , and he said I was a foolish little girl and told me there was nothing wrong in his loving me ; he said some kinds of love between men and women were wrong , of course , but he only loved me as if I were his little girl . I was his little sunshine , he said , and
65984	65985	65974	65975	his wife	243	" "
66001	66061	65998	65998	she	243	" I understand your small games by this time . I know very well why you bought that picture , and the meaning of your pleasant looks . Oh , yes , I am not such a fool as you take me for , nor she , either , with her flowers and her seaweeds and her pretty innocent little face.√≠
66062	66111	66116	66116	her	1907	" I went out of the room then , because I did not want to hear more ; but suddenly , I do n't know why , the thought came to me that they were talking about me . I asked him that evening , and he said : "
66350	66477	66479	66479	you	1920	" One afternoon , when all the others were out on the beach and I was left at home to get tea ready , he came in . I was kneeling on the pantry dresser , filling a glass pot with jam , when I looked round and saw him standing behind me . He came up and lifted me down in his arms and carried me into the dining - room . Then he sat down with me in the great armchair and held me very close to him , and asked me if I loved him , utterly , better than anything else in the world . When I said yes , he put his face down close to mine and said very softly . "
66570	66571	66563	66563	he	0	" "
66620	66697	66608	66608	I	0	" But after that day I loved him with another kind of love , not like the love I loved him with before ; and I could not bear to be in the same room with him when there were other people , because it seemed as though they must see in my face how much I loved him . And every day he begged me to go away with him , but I always said , "
66774	66841	66745	66745	he	1927	" So many weeks went on and sometimes I used to get miserable and ask him to go away . Then he used to hold me in his arms and kiss me , and I forgot everything . You see , I was working , working all the day and at night I was tired , so tired . Sometimes when I was with the children on the
66860	66979	66980	66980	I	0	" At last one day they all went away to see a great show in the next town . They went for two or three days , and I was left to take care of the house . It seemed so dreadful to have to think of being there alone for two whole days and never seeing him once . I cried , and in the afternoon I fell asleep on the sofa wrapped in his great - coat , and did not wake till next morning . Then I put the house in order and got a great heap of his stockings to darn . When I went to bed that night I was not very tired . "
67173	67228	67141	67141	I	0	" It seemed to me as though the morning would never come and I would go mad before it came . He had called me his little angel and his sunshine and I had been like a devil to him , making him sin , and now it was done and could never be undone .
67229	67513	67518	67518	him	1932	" The next day they came . I thought he had got tired of me , for when he came into the dining - room where I was standing he hardly said good - day to me or looked at me . He took the letter from my hand and we never were together again . I told my aunt that evening that I was going away . She was very angry and said I was mad and very ungrateful , but that she would be glad when I was gone . Then I went into the nursery and wrote to the teacher of the school I had been to , and asked her if she would let me come and teach the little ones . I would not want money if only she would let me come at once . When I had done I sat thinking and it seemed to me as though I must go and tell his wife everything ; it was sin , nothing else mattered , and it seemed as though if we told everything that it would be less . So I got up , but when I got to the door of her room I thought how angry he would be and so I went back . By and by , I went again ; but now the light was out , and when I stood close by the door I could hear her breathing and his . I listened for a little time and then I went back again to my room . The next morning when I looked out at the window I saw him walking on the road that led to the beach ,
67901	67910	67911	67911	he	1932	" Come to me , come to me , "
67914	67928	67911	67911	he	1932	" They asked him if he wanted his wife , but he said , "
67962	68029	67956	67956	I	0	" said the grey woman , very quietly . When Undine turned to put the locket in her hand , tears were in her own eyes ; but on the woman 's face was only that strange smile , sadder than any tears . The voyage was almost ended . That night they would be in Table Bay . Undine sat with her companion on the deck .
68030	68042	68044	68044	she	1946	" Do you stay here or go on to Algoa Bay ? "
68048	68054	68055	68056	the woman	837	" I must stay here , "
68059	68076	68055	68056	the woman	837	" I must earn money to take me on . I never worked for money before . "
68077	68088	68090	68090	Undine	143	" It is not very hard to live without it , "
68092	68102	68104	68105	the woman	837	" No , I never wanted it till now , "
68107	68137	68104	68105	the woman	837	" and a lady whom I had taken care of paid my passage and my dog 's . I do n't know what made her so kind to me . "

69872	69880	69882	69883	the woman	837	" The waggon belongs to my husband , "
69885	69936	69882	69883	the woman	837	" and I 'm sure he ca n't take anyone . You see , there is me and the three children , and the tent is small , and I could not undertake to care for anyone else . I would rather try and get some one to help me . "

70125	70157	70122	70123	Mr. Snappercaps	164	" If she 's dressed up it does not say much for her that she 's knocking about by herself and wants to go to the Fields . Is she married ? "

74971	74985	74987	74988	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" Why , surely you 're not a Roman Catholic , are you ? "

75045	75055	75057	75058	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" You must be something ; everybody is something , "
75074	75098	75057	75058	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" You must be something ; nobody 's nothing . You are n't a Unitrinitarian nor anything of that sort , are you ? "

75142	75180	75123	75124	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" You are not an atheist , or a deatheist , like Shakespeare or Votter or that wicked Bishop Colso who lives at Delagoa Bay , are you ? You believe the Bible , do n't you ? "
75181	75190	75192	75192	Undine	143	" Ferdinando will be getting into the fire , "
75305	75317	75318	75318	she	165	" There is no need to rush away in a rage , "
75371	75581	75583	75584	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" Of course you 'll try to get away , of course you do n't like to speak about it , when you know it 's true . If it was n't true , would n't you be glad to disown it , would n't you be glad to disclaim it , when charged with it ? If that book you 've got in your pocket was not some monotheistical nonsense , would you read it alone on the sly , in secret when there was no eye to see you ? Oh ! no ! no ! I wonder you are not afraid to say such dreadful , terrible things lest the God you do n't believe in should strike you dead . I wonder that you were n't afraid , when the waggon went over the bridge , that God would break it down and let you tumble into the water . I wonder you were n't . If it was n't if it was n't that I want to act like a Christian by you , I would not let my oxen take you one step further . How do I know how you may divert my poor innocent little children . Give me the baby ! "

You are no more sleeping than I am , Mr. Snappercaps ; but I wonder , yes , I do wonder that you can act as you do . I wonder you can act so . You can sit there still , you can listen , when even that vile , lowly , venomous outcast felt it ; she could not sit still and hear it ; she had to get up and go away ; but you , you have no more heart than a stone , than a Kaffir , than an adamantine . When David heard the voice of the Prophet he repented , but you , you have no faith , no pity , no affection . Ho - o - o ! Ho - o - o ! Ho - o - o ! "

76883	77032	76880	76881	Sarah Jane	93	" Very nice , so nice ; but it wo n't do with me , no it wo n't . You think I 've not seen it , do you ? I 've never heard you call my baby heavy , have I ? I never saw you go down on your knees to blow the fire for her . I was asleep , fast asleep , of course , in the waggon . Oh yes no , do n't speak , do n't try and deny it ; it 's no use , William , it 's no use . It 's not once , it 's not twice ; it 's four times : it 's four times that I 've seen you with these eyes turn the chops over to find a raw one because she said she liked them raw . I saw it once "
77042	77056	77033	77034	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" I saw it once , and I kept still . I said , "

77169	77199	77161	77162	her husband	1482	" That 's right , Mr. Snappercaps ; say I 'm mad , send me to Roben Island , 3 slaughter me , murder me , as 1 A snake .
77253	77281	77238	77238	you	180	" So saying , she raised the Masters Ferdinando and Algernon from the ground , with each arm and with as much energy as she had seated them .

77339	77347	77334	77335	Mr. Snappercaps	164	" what confounded nonsense you do talk ! "

77403	77416	77418	77419	Mr. Snappercaps	164	" Oh , hang it ! Damn it ! Confound it all ! "
77421	77435	77418	77419	Mr. Snappercaps	164	" I wish the woman would go to blazes , to the devil . "
77436	77445	77447	77448	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" There is no need to wish that , "
77450	77486	77447	77448	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" every step that your oxen take they are bringing her nearer to him . What do you think she 's going to the Fields for , if it 's not to go to him ? "

77534	77557	77528	77528	he	1482	" if you give me any more of this nonsense I 'll put the woman down at the first hotel we come to .
77558	77565	77567	77568	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" No , you wo n't , "
77585	77625	77580	77580	he	1482	" No , you wo n't . Vile as she is , I 'll act to her as a Christian should . I 've said I would take her to the Fields , and I shall take her there . "
77626	77637	77639	77640	Mr. Snappercaps	164	" Did n't know Christians took folks to the devil , "
77804	77815	77826	77827	his mother	771	" That is what comes of playing on a Sunday , "
77829	77840	77826	77827	his mother	771	" You wicked little boys ! Leave that sand alone . "
77841	77852	77854	77854	Undine	143	" It was my fault ; I began the play , "
77856	77898	77900	77901	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" Well , I wish you would take his pinafore and wring it out ; and if you have his , it would not be more trouble to take Algernon Sidney 's and the baby 's and give them a rub , "
77945	77978	77932	77933	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" Oh yes , do go to him , go at once . I do n't wish to hinder you , not at all . Go to him ! Go ! Go ! "
77979	77984	77986	77986	Undine	143	" Go to whom ? "
78024	78032	78034	78035	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" Oh , you sweet little thing ! "
78037	78126	78128	78129	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" You do n't know that he is over at the kloof , do you ? You never sit with your head stuck on your hand staring at the fire , just to try and look sentimental and make him feel sorry for you . You never do , do you ? You would not do such a thing ! And you never pretended you could not make a fire on purpose to get him to come and help you ! And you do n't get up early , "
78154	78207	78209	78210	Mrs. Snappercaps	165	" you do n't get up in the grey dawn and sit on the trap and try and look melancholy till he comes to talk with you . You would not think of doing such a thing ! I 'm glad to see you do n't deny it ; you ca n't , "
79214	79225	79230	79230	she	165	" She 's a fool and out of her senses , "

79771	79782	79783	79783	She	143	" not if you do n't give me a shilling . "

79982	79993	79994	79994	she	837	" You can get a bed for four and six , "
80284	80297	80277	80277	she	143	" Could you tell me where I could get lodgings for tonight ? "
80307	80318	80320	80323	the 1 Colesberg Koppie	184	" No , not in this part of the Camp , "
80338	80347	80331	80331	woman	931	" Have yer been long in New Rush ? "

80355	80361	80353	80353	Undine	143	" I arrived this evening . "
80370	80402	80367	80367	Undine	143	" Perhaps you would be so kind as to tell me where I might be able to get work . I should be very much obliged to you if you could . "
80403	80406	80408	80409	the woman	837	" Work ? "
80411	80433	80408	80409	the woman	837	" There 's work enough if there were only hands to do it . What sort of work do yer want ? "
80434	80441	80443	80443	Undine	143	" Ironing any kind of work , "
80445	80452	80443	80443	Undine	143	" I do n't care what . "
80487	80528	80484	80484	she	837	" If yer can iron , yer can come in and help me get these things done and stay here tonight , but I ca n't give yer a bed ; we 've only one and that 's only sacks . "
81028	81041	81043	81043	Undine	143	" I 've come for the box I left here yesterday evening , "
81055	81060	81061	81061	he	2309	" There it is , "
81075	81087	81088	81088	she	143	" Is there anyone here I could get to carry it ? "
81091	81098	81088	81088	she	143	" It 's not very heavy . "
81099	81102	81104	81105	the nigger	2309	" No , "

81220	81233	81234	81234	she	143	" This is not the place ; you have made a mistake , "

81659	81782	81784	81785	the woman	837	" I 've been thinking that perhaps yer'd like rather to get work on yer own account ; if yer would , why , I knows a Mr. MacCuligan who pays well , he does , and he 's not over - particular neither . I would not give him up , but , yer see , I 've got more work than I can manage , as ' tis . You see , everybody knows me , that 's the thing ; they know that I 'm a honest woman , would not touch a button . It 's the character as brings the work . If nobody knows yer , why , yer wo n't get a shirt to iron , "
81846	81891	81839	81839	her	143	" Oh , yer could use some of my irons ; I 've got a lot yer see ; and wood and such like yer could pay for , yer know , and Mr. MacCuligan he do n't care how his shirts are neither . "
81974	81985	81987	81988	the woman	837	" It 's an awful paying thing , ironing is , "
81990	82009	81987	81988	the woman	837	" awful paying . It 's as good as having a claim in New Rush Kop , it is "
82028	82053	82024	82024	she	143	" To yer it would be , of course , I mean . I 've got so many brats , what I makes goes . "
82083	82090	82092	82093	the woman	837	" It 's a long way , "
82095	82120	82092	82093	the woman	837	" and perhaps yer'll think it round about , but the ways in this Fields is round about . Tommy , he knows the way to

82538	82544	82514	82514	he	2357	" it 's the way . "
82550	82579	82580	82580	she	143	" Why , I thought we passed this tent with the barrel before it a little while ago ! Are we not almost at Mr. MacCuligan 's yet ? "
82588	82594	82596	82596	Tommy	186	" It 's the way , "

82787	82803	82785	82785	Undine	143	" I think I shall turn back . I ca n't go on any more . "
82844	82863	82865	82865	Tommy	186	" It 's the way , but yer do n't get there if yer do n't keep on , "

84070	84077	84078	84078	she	143	" You can take this first , "

86575	86578	86572	86572	Undine	143	" Yes . "
86619	86631	86633	86633	Undine	143	" It 's the first flower I have seen growing here , "
86642	86688	86689	86689	She	143	" A gentleman threw it away one day . It had a withered rose on it then ; but I put a white bottle over it , and I hold it in the sun all day , and now it 's growing , you see . "
86704	86719	86721	86721	Undine	143	" Do n't you get very tired of sitting still with it all day ? "
86738	86749	86734	86734	she	143	" I ca n't walk ; my back 's hurt . "
86750	86763	86701	86701	she	143	" And so you sit here alone all day nursing your flower . "
86764	86801	86803	86804	the child	223	" Mostly , but sometimes the woman who stops with father do n't always go out . I wish she always did . When mother was here she always stayed in , but she 's dead , "
86822	86831	86833	86833	Undine	143	" Have you been long unable to walk ? "
86844	86855	86856	86856	She	143	" Since she beat me the night before she died . "
86872	86883	86856	86856	She	143	" What do you do to try and get better ? "
86884	86887	86889	86890	the child	223	" Nothing , "
86892	86940	86889	86890	the child	223	" One of those gentlemen that go about with the little black bags and the sugar pills , he stopped and talked to me one day and he gave me something to rub with , but I ca n't rub it and there is no one can . "
86941	86950	86951	86952	The child	223	" Ca n't I rub it for you ? "
86965	86995	86959	86959	her	143	" It 's in the tent , and Mary Jones would be angry if anyone went in when she 's gone out . Do you live far from here ? "
86996	87003	87005	87005	Undine	143	" I do n't live anywhere , "
87007	87014	87015	87016	The child	223	" I am looking for work . "
87048	87054	87045	87045	she	143	" What kind of work ? "
87055	87059	87060	87060	She	143	" Anything ironing . "
87065	87068	87060	87060	She	143	" Needlework , "
87146	87193	87143	87143	she	2515	" Mary Jones has lots of ironing in the tent , and she always drinks too much to do it . If you stay till she comes I think she 'll let you get some . So Undine sat down on the ground beside her and waited .
87712	87744	87709	87709	she	143	" The ground 's so wet I ca n't lie on it , and in here it 's so nice . I can rock from side to side . Just see ! "
87765	87770	87709	87709	she	143	" And the rose ? "
87771	87789	87791	87792	the girl	630	" Oh , it 's all right , but it seems as though spring would never come , "
87819	87836	87837	87837	she	143	" You only stayed such a little while yesterday , you must not go soon today , "
87855	87864	87865	87865	she	143	" I ca n't stay very long today , "
87868	87923	87865	87865	she	143	" I must try and find the owner of those shirts . Three months ago they were brought me , and no one has ever called for them ; I am afraid the person to whom they belong must be poor and need them , they are so fine and so old and worn . "
87924	87940	87942	87943	the girl	630	" He 's waited so long , he wo n't mind waiting a little longer , "
87965	87975	87976	87976	she	143	" Tell me what you wrote about last night , "
88047	88054	88056	88056	Undine	143	" I did not write anything , "
88072	88099	88059	88059	she	143	" I was so tired I went to sleep with the pen in my hand , and when I woke the candle had quite burnt out . "
88100	88110	88059	88059	she	143	" And have you not anything to tell me ? "
88111	88123	88059	88059	she	143	" No . I have been so busy all the morning . "
88124	88134	88059	88059	she	143	" And ca n't you think while you work ? "
88135	88178	88179	88180	The child	223	" Sometimes , not often ; but yesterday evening , when I was putting the collars into starch , a little story came to me that seemed beautiful then , though it does not now . Shall I tell it to you ? "
88198	88300	88187	88187	her	143	" A mother was lying on her bed , dying , and at her side was a very little baby . The people who stood round her thought she knew nothing , saw nothing ; and truly she saw none of them . She felt only the touch of the little baby 's fingers upon her breast , but she saw what no one else could see in the far end of the room were two , drawing balls from a box which had no bottom ; and Death 's balls were the pure white and Life 's were the blood red .
88301	88324	88187	88187	her	143	" Death was very tall and calm and his face was smooth and white , like a face cut out of marble ; his
88363	88402	88354	88354	his	2540	" A ball was drawn , and it was Death 's white ball ; so the mother knew that she must go to him ; but when they were going to draw again , she prayed and said : "
88403	88439	88441	88441	Life	193	" Stay ! stay ! O Death ; give Life my child!√≠ For she feared him , he was so still and cold , and they were strange wonderful dreams that wandered beneath his eyelids . "
88444	88466	88441	88441	Life	193	" Let the mother see what we have to give it , and she shall decide who is to have the child.√≠ "
88474	88620	88441	88441	Life	193	" Now Life was very beautiful ; her hair was like the yellow glory of the sunset , and her limbs were strong and soft and round , and her breast was as white as an open lily . Her cheeks were red , so red that the tear traces could hardly be seen on them , and her white dazzling wings were always quivering and expanded , yet they never raised her or took her from the earth . She was very lovely , and the bright robe she wore was of spotless tender green , the colour of the first shoots on the white - thorn tree ; only here and there , where it turned up a little , the lining showed it was red and had clots on as though it had been dipped in blood . She was very beautiful ; but
88659	88705	88654	88654	she	1601	" Life spoke first , and her voice was like the singing of the birds in spring - time , and the murmuring of the crowd in a great city , and the weeping of a lonely woman at a graveside , all strangely blended . "
88706	88716	88726	88727	the mother	1601	" Look in my eyes , √≠ she said , "
88730	88774	88726	88727	the mother	1601	" In the streets of a great city rolled the carriage of a rich man , and the mud from its wheels sprang up into the faces of two who were poor and hungry and stood at the corner of the street talking . "
88775	88784	88726	88727	the mother	1601	" Whose carriage is that?√≠ asked the one . "
88785	88809	88726	88727	the mother	1601	" The man who rides in it is the richest and most fortunate man in all this city , √≠ answered the other . "
88869	88870	88862	88862	I	0	" "
88881	88882	88874	88874	you	0	" "
88925	88926	88916	88916	his	2549	" "
88947	89022	88944	88944	he	0	" The fortunate man was walking in his garden . He was very fat , and the only walk he ever took was up and down its gravel paths . The air was rich with the scent of the flowers , and the light of the afternoon sun made the drops of the leaping fountain sparkle more brightly than the diamond on his finger . A small bird was bathing itself in the water . "
89023	89032	88944	88944	he	0	" Now , √≠ said the rich man , "
89057	89091	89052	89052	I	0	" Then he thought of the grand dinner he was to give the next day , and how his beautiful daughter was to marry one of the great lords who would be there . "
89179	89211	89231	89233	the poor man	2549	" Then the rich man walked up and down again and basked in the sunshine . It was a man 's own fault if he had trouble and was poor and friendless ,
89576	89599	89570	89570	she	2580	" Now , when the mother saw all this , she would have given the child to Death , for she said , "
89609	89615	89624	89624	she	2580	" But Life prevented her : "
89627	89803	89624	89624	she	2580	" And the mother looked . It was a garden again , a wild neglected garden where the flowers and creepers grew rank and free in each other 's arms , and beauty was not measured out . At the root of a great tree , almost enfolded and hidden by the shrubs that grew around it , stood a man . His face was young and one to be pitied by the old and wise , for it was very glad and full of hope . In his arms , pressed close to him , was a woman , and not one of the flowers had a face so fair as hers ; but , deep in her eyes , crept a look like the look which crept in the eyes of the serpent in that First Garden long ago . They were sweet long kisses ; and the words she spoke to him were sweet , the sweet old words of love and faith which women speak to men ; and he believed her .
89804	89836	89624	89624	she	2580	" His heart grew very strong and great through the mighty love that came to him , and their life path lay before him in a mist of light and beauty . Truly
89907	90094	90095	90100	The woman he had once loved	2583	" But the day came , at last , when he did see it when she looked into his face and laughed , and he knew that when he pressed the woman he loved to his heart it was only the grey old father of lies he had held . Now , life being for him that woman and that woman being evil , he became evil too . For the sake of what he had once loved , he deceived all women , and drank and cursed , and gained gold by evil , and spent it in sin ; and men said that , wherever he passed , you might trace him by the ruin and evil he left behind . Yet they envied him , for the women loved him , and where other men would have starved he made gold . He might eat of the fruit of the earth and satisfy himself : its gold , its wine , or its women they were all free to him who had no conscience to restrain and no faith in a higher power . "
90130	90137	90142	90142	I	0	" Then she said , softly : "
90180	90181	90201	90201	Death	192	" "
90192	90193	90201	90201	Death	192	" "
90203	90219	90201	90201	Death	192	" And the mother would have given the child to him , but Life said : "
90233	90337	90230	90230	she	2583	" There was a street with great and noble houses , and out at the door of one of them came a young man . His shoulders were bent and , as he walked , his eyes were fixed upon the ground ; only once he looked up at the great houses at his side and saw the faces of two soft women looking out of a large window . Then he clenched the fingers of the hand that hung at his side till the nails went into the flesh , and clenched his teeth and swore under his breath a bitter oath . "
90436	90454	90433	90433	his	3044	" It was a dreary empty place where the sunlight never entered and where dry bread was eaten and
90578	90645	90661	90661	she	2594	" One evening she did not come , and he sat there alone , thinking , thinking . The room was very quiet , but there was a great war raging in the man 's heart . At last he brought his hand down on the table and swore between his clenched teeth , as he had sworn that day before the rich men 's houses . "
90646	90660	90661	90661	she	2594	" She will not help me in my work , √≠ he said ; "
90701	90745	90696	90696	she	2594	" So in the grey dawn of the winter morning he stood in the door of his room , ready to leave it for the last time . She was labouring up the stairs with a great heap of coals in her arms . "
90746	90763	90764	90766	the lodger belowstairs	2602	" These are for you , √≠ she said , her breath coming quick with pleasure : "
90776	90798	90799	90799	I	0	" There were burning drops under his eyelids , but he let her pass into the room ; then he said , "
90803	90826	90799	90799	I	0	" She looked up into his face , for his voice sounded strange , but it was too dark to see him . "
90827	90835	90837	90837	he	0	" Will you stay long?√≠ she asked . "
90914	90941	90955	90955	you	2603	" Years came , years went ; his hair grew whiter ; his shoulders stooped lower yet ; and alone and in bitterness he laboured on . "
90942	90954	90955	90955	you	2603	" Oh , you rich and noble , √≠ he said , "
91002	91069	90993	90993	he	0	" And at last it came . The world called him great ; it wrote of him in its papers ; men talked of him on the street , and women in their houses . The children learned to lisp his name ; rich men asked him to their dinners ; noblewomen came to visit him , only that they might say that they had seen him .
91070	91082	91115	91115	he	0	" He was very great , and his fame was very great ,
91102	91103	91115	91115	he	0	" "
91121	91151	91115	91115	he	0	" and leave me . You say I am dying why should you stay for that ? You can not help me.√≠ So they went out and left him . "
91208	91209	91197	91197	himself	2609	" "
91242	91255	91217	91218	the phantom	2610	" I never cared for gold , √≠ said the great man . "
91268	91297	91323	91323	he	0	" He had grown a little deaf of late , and now he could hear less ; there was often a low short cry ringing in his ears . "
91298	91308	91323	91323	he	0	" Fools pray for gold , √≠ he said , "
91312	91317	91323	91323	he	0	" The phantom nodded . "
91326	91387	91323	91323	he	0	" you swore you would be great and that the high and noble should receive you into their houses , fair women should covet your notice and proud men your visits . You have gained all that ; surely you are blessed . It is true you have paid something for it a little some pleasure , the rest of a few
91422	91423	91323	91323	he	0	" "
91444	91514	91438	91440	the great man	3892	" They write of me in their papers ; I never read their praises now . My house is better why should I go to theirs ! Fair women come to see me what are fair women to me ! They only disturb me with their childish chatter ; and sometimes , if they have blue eyes Ha ! if that were all , better to have died a baby.√≠ "
91529	91530	91518	91518	his	2610	" "
91557	91558	91563	91565	the great man	3892	" "
91567	91599	91563	91565	the great man	3892	" it has not been for nothing . The man who looks for happiness in this life is a fool . I live for the future . I would be immortal . Immortal!√≠
91600	91623	91563	91565	the great man	3892	" The phantom leaned back in his armchair and laughed till the silvered tassel of his red cap trembled again in the firelight !
91624	91625	91563	91565	the great man	3892	" "
91839	91863	91836	91837	the phantom	2610	" A paltry two thousand years has dimmed the radiance of her redeemers and prophets ; how long do you think earth will remember you?√≠
91864	91875	91836	91837	the phantom	2610	" The phantom laughed again and looked into the fire : "
91952	91957	91949	91950	the phantom	2610	" Fool ! Fool ! Fool!√≠
91958	91980	91949	91950	the phantom	2610	" With his hands clasped over his face and his head bowed down to his knees , the old man sat . "
91981	91991	91949	91950	the phantom	2610	" Oh , my life , √≠ he cried , "
92010	92020	92032	92032	they	2635	" Three days later the great man died , and the
92043	92094	92040	92040	They	2635	" Weep , weep , for a great man is dead ; weep , weep!√≠ But for all that , no one wept . Only one half - starved man who lived alone in the garret where he laboured and toiled , he wept for envy , for he said , "
92107	92117	92040	92040	They	2635	" Then Life dropped her lids for a moment . "
92118	92128	92130	92131	the mother	1601	" And I have rest , √≠ said Death . "
92143	92158	92140	92140	Life	193	" Look again , once more;√≠ and the mother looked for the last time . "
92232	92297	92213	92213	he	0	" The other clerks called him fool ; if they had known how his nights were spent they would have called him so more often . When their day 's work was over they went out to amuse themselves , but he only shut himself up in his room and walked up and down and prayed and wrote himself half mad before the morning came .
92298	92330	92357	92357	She	2640	" It was well there was no living thing to see him but the little brown mouse that looked out of its hole and wished it could have nibbled at the candle .
92386	92416	92357	92357	She	2640	" She would get no more , however , for the pen was lying under the table , and the man looked very disconsolate as he sat beside it . "
92430	92611	92418	92418	he	2641	" Yes , I 'm a great fool , as they say . Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . Let us do as the sheep do ; they only are wise . Beauty is an angel that no man ever caught ; truth is a deception that changes to falsehood while you finger it . We are shadows among shadows . Why be so in earnest ? Why make oneself so hot about it all ? Why strive and pray and make so great a bluster ? Life is n't worth it . Something , nothing , here , gone ; let us make the best of it , wear the nicest clothes , eat the nicest meat , and love the easiest love , and believe what comes to hand ; tread on , steady and safe , step by step , in the narrow sandy path our fathers cleared from stones and bushes long ago . If this can not be , why , curse life and die it is the best thing left.√≠ "
92656	92841	92842	92842	He	2642	" So this poor clerk went on , month after month , praying and writing all night and measuring off dresses by the yard all day ; but at last it happened that one of his dreams took a human shape , and a pair of clear still eyes looked into his life and made him richer than the great princes of the Golden Isles , whose houses and whose shoes are covered with jewels . It was true , as men speak , that the eyes belonged not to him but to a woman who was nothing to him a woman who was high above him and who would surely be carried , some day , to another man 's home . Yet when he was beside her she spoke to him kindly , and in her face he found the beauty in her mind , the truth he dreamed of . He knew that she was his though she did not love him , for he loved her , and no one could ever take her from him , not she herself . "
92945	92978	92994	92995	a child	443	" The years passed on , and they still called him a fool , for he made no money . He never stayed long enough in any place , but wandered on from town
93034	93108	93110	93110	his	2642	" He made no money and no friends , this poor fool of a clerk . Only sometimes , when pain or sorrow would draw people to him , they would enter his life for a little time ; but when they were comforted they would go out of it again , and he would go on with his wanderings and sing his songs and smile and love the beautiful green old earth . "
93291	93382	93396	93397	the mother	1601	" He died young and they buried him in the earth he loved ; but there was not a tear shed over him . For why ? What had he done all his life ? Sold a few yards of print and ribbon , cast up a few accounts , suffered a little agony , prayed a little , doubted a little , comforted a few people who were sad ; and for the rest lived much as the birds live , singing and loving and revelling in the sunshine . "
93383	93394	93396	93397	the mother	1601	" I have that to give , √≠ said Life . "
93400	93415	93396	93397	the mother	1601	" Take my child . Your best is bitter sweet , but it is sweet.√≠ "
93426	93446	93417	93417	Death	192	" When Undine had finished her story they sat quiet for a little time . Then the girl said , "
93471	93472	93466	93466	I	0	" "
93478	93482	93473	93473	I	0	" said Undine , "
93554	93567	93568	93568	Diogenes	195	" And Undine got up and put her tray upon her arm . "
93574	93574	93568	93568	Diogenes	195	"
93575	93598	93568	93568	Diogenes	195	" Why , Diogenes was a man who lived in a tub , as you are doing today ; and I call you Diogenes
93618	93618	93602	93602	I	0	"
93619	93625	93568	93568	Diogenes	195	" Am I your friend ? "
93649	93657	93658	93658	She	143	" Yes , my only little friend . "
93668	93693	93664	93664	Diogenes	195	" Do you really think people do nothing but dream after they are dead ? You said Death 's eyes were full of dreams . "
93694	93703	93705	93705	Undine	143	" No , I do n't think so , "
93723	93740	93664	93664	Diogenes	195	" The stories come to me just as they like . I never think about them . "
93741	93746	93748	93748	Diogenes	195	" I 'm sorry , "
93762	93897	93748	93748	Diogenes	195	" Last night I dreamt my rose bush had a great white rose and you had it in your hair , and you and I were walking over little sandhills . The air was so cool and it was dark as though there was going to be a great storm ; I was looking up into your face , and you were looking straight out before you , and your eyes were so strange . And at last we came to the sea , and you said you were going over it . It was a sad dream , but I liked it , and when I woke up father was drunk and they were all quarrelling and I wished I had never woken up any more . It 's so nice to dream . "
93898	93909	93911	93914	the little ironing woman	2661	" Yes , dreams are nice . Good - bye . "
94612	94630	94631	94631	he	2681	" I do n't want them ; you had better take them and keep them as payment , "
94847	94853	94854	94854	she	143	" You are very ill , "
94857	94863	94854	94854	she	143	" Have you much pain ? "
94864	94867	94868	94868	he	2681	" No , "
94882	94889	94868	94868	he	2681	" Have you been ill long ? "
94890	94898	94854	94854	she	143	" Yes no I do n't know ; "
94906	94931	94932	94932	she	143	" Would you not feel a little better if you tried to lie down ? It must be very hard to sit up here , "
94937	94949	94932	94932	she	143	" I would , but it 's such a long way . "
95181	95201	95202	95202	she	143	" I wish he had stopped in England ; it would have been a great deal nicer for him , "
95216	95242	95247	95247	Undine	143	" England 's such a nice country , they say , and there 's nothing nice in this land . I wonder why he came . "
95250	95255	95257	95257	Diogenes	195	" Is he better ? "
95279	95290	95291	95291	she	195	" I do n't believe he tries to get better , "
95298	95312	95291	95291	she	195	" Do n't you get tired to keep running up here all day ? "
95313	95357	95265	95265	her	195	" Not tired , but I am going to look for some Kaffir men to carry his tent down next to mine ; then I will be able to take care of him and iron too . How is your back this morning ? "
95358	95361	95363	95363	Diogenes	195	" Well , "
95367	95372	95374	95374	Undine	143	" I 'm glad , "
95376	95393	95395	95395	she	143	" I 'll come back again when I have got the Kaffirs . Good - bye . "
95399	95406	95408	95408	Diogenes	195	" I wish he was gone , "
95410	95424	95426	95426	she	143	" It is not a bit nice any more . Heigh - ho ! "
95830	95835	95837	95837	he	2705	" Put that iron away "
95842	95876	95837	95837	he	2705	" till it gets cool . My eyes ache with them . They are always in your hands . I want you to answer me a question I ca n't answer for myself . "
95877	95880	95882	95882	Undine	143	" Well ? "
95906	95925	95900	95900	she	143	" What is it ? I do n't think the irons have absorbed quite all my intellect yet . "
95926	95997	95837	95837	he	2705	" As the spades and picks did mine . Tell me how it is that I am quite contented to lie here and be fed and nursed by you , and do n't feel as though I ought even to thank you , when I would die sooner than take a broken sixpence from my own flesh and blood ? How is it ? I 'm too weak to think . "
95998	96011	96012	96012	she	143	" You must be weak if you ca n't think that out , "
96042	96104	96106	96106	Undine	143	" Do n't you know there are things we have to be more grateful for than being nursed and fed ? You 've given me something to take care of , and so , though you do n't think it , you feel you have done more for me than I for you . As for getting help from our relations , "
96115	96171	96172	96172	she	143	" they are just the last people to go to unless one likes getting a pain in one 's pride bones . One always has a lurking suspicion they are doing it from principle or necessity or something equally disagreeable ; and that 's why their money hurts . But my irons are getting cold , "
96179	96189	96190	96190	he	2718	" Do n't you ever get tired of them ? "
96193	96201	96172	96172	she	143	" It 's so burning hot today . "
96202	96229	96172	96172	she	143	" Oh no , I never get tired , and it 's not so hot today as it might be . I get to like it . "
96271	96281	96282	96282	she	143	" What a very uneven little path this is , "
96424	96431	96421	96421	she	143	" Are you very tired today ? "
96432	96439	96421	96421	she	143	" No , not at all . "
96440	96465	96421	96421	she	143	" You do n't look happy . I wish I knew what was the matter ; I wish you need never be tired or sad "
96532	96540	96542	96542	Diogenes	195	" Oh dear ! what is it ? "
96553	96587	96542	96542	Diogenes	195	" I did not know you could be so miserable . I thought you saw such beautiful things , you were always happy . I 'm sure it 's all that man 's fault "
96603	96622	96590	96590	Diogenes	195	" No , it is not ; only I am weak and faint , and I want money . "
96653	96684	96542	96542	Diogenes	195	" Thou shalt not love money ; thou shalt not desire it ; thou shalt despise it ; it is the child of the devil , and his eldest born . "
96807	96819	96790	96790	she	195	" Ca n't you get money enough to pay the doctor ? "
96835	96871	96820	96820	she	195	" No , I can get that . I want much money , almost a hundred pounds . If I ca n't get that I do n't want any , I do n't want anything . "
96924	96949	96900	96900	She	195	" If you were to sell this , perhaps you would get much money ; diamonds are so dear and it is so beautiful . "
97135	97143	97145	97145	Diogenes	195	" Are you going to sell it ? "
97147	97153	97155	97155	Undine	143	" Yes , at once , "
97160	97168	97155	97155	Undine	143	" and I will come back soon . "
97169	97186	97190	97190	herself	195	" I know she liked that ring , and now she has got to sell it , "
97200	97248	97250	97250	Diogenes	195	" It 's all his fault , I know it is . Perhaps she wants to send him to England . She said yesterday he was worse and would never get better if he could n't go . I do wonder why he did not stay there , "
97269	97280	97253	97253	her	195	" I do n't go about everywhere making everybody miserable . "
97403	97411	97413	97413	Diogenes	195	" I knew it was for him , "
97700	97702	97706	97706	i.e.	2737	" Bort "
97709	97711	97706	97706	i.e.	2737	" dust "
97715	97718	97706	97706	i.e.	2737	" diamonds . "
97938	97999	98001	98001	he	2729	" You are such a genius , Little Irons , in spite of your big kappie and your shirts . The world shall know of you some day , and I shall be so proud of the Little Irons who came to help me when all the world would have left me to drop out of life like a dog . "
98447	98460	98461	98461	he	2729	" Good - bye , my friend , my dear Little Irons , "
98495	98509	98510	98510	he	2729	" I 've been a great bother to you , dear Little Irons , "
98522	98555	98510	98510	he	2729	" You will have rest when I am gone and go back to your happy , quiet old life ; and I shall never forget you , never . How could I ? "
98568	98580	98581	98581	she	143	" Do n't take it off till the sun gets warm , "
98584	98595	98596	98596	he	2729	" Oh , I 'll take good care of myself , "
98618	98625	98607	98607	he	2729	" Good - bye , but not for
98638	98649	98629	98629	I	0	" he said , as he took her hand in his .
98682	98689	98675	98675	Undine	143	" Meet again ! meet again ! "
98771	98786	98768	98768	we	2759	" We part only for today ; through life we shall often meet again , "
98899	98907	98911	98911	she	143	" We shall meet again some day , "
99117	99130	99131	99131	she	143	" It is all right . He is happy , very happy , "
99143	99151	99152	99152	she	143	" He is happy , very happy , "
99276	99303	99264	99264	she	143	" Go away , and do not follow me . If you follow me I shall love you and I , I have had pain enough . "
99425	99488	99536	99536	she	143	" I will forget , I will forget everything , and live only in the present ; then , soon , there will be no reason to forget , for this little love will fade away like the yearning for my monkey and the madness that looks so grotesque , and unreal now and which nothing could ever again bring back nothing . "
99653	99665	99666	99666	he	2788	" Have you done the shirts a girl brought here yesterday ? "
99760	99785	99757	99757	he	2788	" If you want more work , I dare say you could get it if you come to our place Mr. Albert Blair 's . "
99886	99895	99883	99883	she	143	" You can keep the money for yourself . "
100146	100191	100193	100193	Diogenes	195	" I 've been so tired of waiting for you all these two days . I thought you would never come . Stoop down before the tub and shut your eyes tight and then look in and see what I 've got for you , "
100237	100248	100250	100250	Diogenes	195	" Is n't it beautiful ? Is n't it beautiful ? "
100257	100294	100250	100250	Diogenes	195	" Pick it ; it 's for you . No you must not pick it . I will and fasten it in your hair just like it was in my dream . Oh , how beautiful ! "
100331	100334	100335	100335	she	143	" Now , "
100347	100359	100335	100335	she	143	" lay down your head and I will put it in . "
100396	100405	100406	100406	she	143	" Now turn round and look at me , "
100433	100441	100427	100427	Diogenes	195	" I had quite forgotten he went away this
100461	100490	100452	100452	you	143	" said Diogenes , who , in truth , for the last forty - eight hours had been gloriously oblivious of every existence save that of her wonderful rosebud .
100538	100553	100535	100535	she	195	" I love you better than anything , better even than my rose bush . "
100602	100617	100619	100619	Undine	143	" It is nice to lie here and rest , but I must go , "
100655	100662	100664	100664	Diogenes	195	" You are sick , too , "
100681	100715	100716	100716	She	195	" Not sick , only tired . I have not been so tired for many years . I want to sleep for a long , long time . I shall be better then . "
100732	100740	100742	100742	Diogenes	195	" Come again soon , very soon , "
100788	100799	100800	100800	Diogenes	195	" You look just like you did in my dream , "
101156	101159	101160	101160	he	2824	" Give , "
101186	101191	101199	101199	he	2828	" You must come , "
101207	101253	101199	101199	he	2828	" Come if it is for only one short half hour . You may allow yourself to be robbed of all pleasure , but others must not be quite forgotten , you know ; even if our claim to be considered is not very strong . "
101273	101304	101268	101268	her	263	" Surely you have done enough in coming to such a place as this . You need not renounce the world altogether ; you are too young to do penance yet "
101354	101364	101365	101365	she	263	" I 've been out two nights this week , "
101368	101399	101365	101365	she	263	" and people might think it strange , you know . The doctor said he was much worse today , and he would be so angry if they told him . "
101430	101436	101438	101439	the mother	1601	" What a lovely flower ! "
101537	101551	101553	101554	the gentleman	2830	" You see the very gods have condescended to interfere in my behalf , "
101556	101571	101553	101554	the gentleman	2830	" This rose means that you are to go and wear it here tonight . "
101612	101626	101609	101609	she	1601	" Well just for one hour , just for one , you know . "
101697	101711	101721	101723	the swell nigger	2793	" Vat jou goed en trek , Ferreira , Vat jou goed en trek ;

101778	101785	101787	101788	the nigger	2309	" Do you want any needlework ? "
101843	101866	101828	101828	He	2793	" Take your things and go , Ferreira , Take your things and go ; Heavy to carry , heavy to carry ... "
101877	101884	101885	101885	Johnny	204	" Jannie met die hoepelbeen , Ferreira "
101923	101965	101972	101975	the ironing - woman	2796	" You see , my master died last night , and Mrs. Blair wants her mourning quickly . Do n't you think , if I was to bring some stuff now , you would be able to do it for her ? "
101994	102002	101979	101979	She	143	" What did your master die of ? "
102003	102009	102011	102012	the nigger	2309	" Well , you see , "
102028	102095	102015	102015	his	2309	" I do n't just rightly know . He came here just to have a look at everything , and he took ill , something wrong inside , and the doctors they wo n't let him travel ; and this six months he 's been lying here , and they 've been saying he was going to die , but he never did till last night . "
102164	102173	102161	102161	her	2796	" When are they going to bury him ? "
102174	102198	102158	102158	he	2309	" Tomorrow morning . They 've put him in a house in the yard ; for Mrs. Blair she 's frightened of ghosts . "

102630	102651	102653	102655	the first man	2875	" Put the candle and matches down , Jack , just there inside the door and button it down tight , "
102657	102679	102653	102655	the first man	2875	" I wonder they like leaving it alone like this without a soul in the place . Dogs might get in . "
102680	102691	102693	102694	the second	2520	" No fear of that while this dog lies here , "
102696	102770	102693	102694	the second	2520	" If I was not with you , I expect you 'd rather be pretty near anywhere than here ; he 'd think no more of tearing you than of growling , if you tried to go in there alone ; he do n't half like it as it is , for all that I 've had the feeding of the beggar for the last six months . Down , Prince , down ! "
102780	102788	102790	102791	the first	1457	" I tell you what , Jack , "
102793	102804	102790	102791	the first	1457	" that coffin was damned heavy . My shoulders ache . "
102805	102813	102815	102816	the second	2520	" Charge it all in the bill , "
102821	102846	102815	102816	the second	2520	" Ten little nigger boys Fiddling over wine ; One got so jolly drunk , And then there were nine , nine , nine . "

104022	104066	104016	104020	the children of the Dutchwoman	2748	" mother , perhaps some wicked man has been to kill the Englishwoman in the little tent . Three days the sail is hanging loose , but we never see her coming out or doing ironing . We think she must be dead . "
104067	104070	104072	104073	the mother	1601	" Nonsense ! "
104075	104092	104072	104073	the mother	1601	" Do n't you have anything to do with her ; she 's a bad woman . "
104093	104100	104112	104112	his	1482	" How do you know that ? "
104115	104162	104164	104165	the wife	2917	" Because I asked her the other day if the man who lived with her was her husband , and she said no . And I asked her if he was any relation of hers , and she said no . So she must be bad , "
104235	104241	104243	104244	the Dutchwoman	2749	" You are very sick , "
104264	104270	104272	104273	the Dutchwoman	208	" You are very sick , "

104397	104403	104405	104405	Undine	143	" No , thank you , "
104436	104448	104420	104420	she	837	" I will come again during the night and see you . "

104491	104500	104488	104489	the mother	1601	" She will be dead in the morning . "

105347	105374	105376	105377	the star	2950	" so ghastly that even the pain and suffering and despair that are in life grow beautiful in your eyes ? I am only your brother , "
105379	105585	105587	105588	the star	2950	" a few million years older than you , and I know nothing ; but I have seen some things a few . I have seen the sun pour forth his light and heat as a great heart pours its life - blood for others . I have seen it fall on a world dead and silent , and awake it ; till in place of death there was life , and for silence sound and ceaseless change . I have seen a world find birth through that light , even those strange and tiny creatures 1 who deep at the floor of the sea have formed their graves and a new land ; the waves have rolled back from it and the land that is built from their skeletons has become tree and grass and a million forms of life ; on these other creatures have lived ; and these again have died that others might have life ; and at last man has come , to bring one of whom from the shapeless germ in which he lies plants innumerable die , and his very next of kin are sacrified that he may grow and be . I have looked long and carefully , "
105590	105663	105587	105588	the star	2950	" and I have seen that the thing which you call death is the father of all life and beauty . Till life goes , till blood flows , no higher life can come . There is nothing added to Nature , nothing taken from her . She has only so much in her hand , and with that she must do all things . Would she build better , she must pull down
105710	105732	105682	105682	she	209	" Without death there is no change , without change no life ; without the shedding of blood no good thing . "

105843	105886	105840	105841	the star	2950	" and what you are , or I am , or the gravel is on which you lie , I can not tell , and what we mean I can not tell ; only that which I have seen I speak of . "
105965	105975	105977	105978	the star	2950	" I have been young and now am old , "
105980	106013	105977	105978	the star	2950	" yet if I should say I have seen death as you fear it , I should lie . Change I have seen and desolation , but no death . Take comfort . "
