They would have pounded me to death , too . A crazy mob , sir , does not discriminate . Under providence we owed our preservation to my Capataz de Cargadores , as they called him in the town , a man who , when I discovered his value , sir , was just the bos'n of an Italian ship , a big Genoese ship , one of the few European ships that ever came to Sulaco with a general cargo before the building of the National Central . He left her on account of some very respectable friends he made here , his own countrymen , but also , I suppose , to better himself . Sir , I am a pretty good judge of character . I engaged him to be the foreman of our lightermen , and caretaker of our jetty . That 's all that he was . But without him Senor Ribiera would have been a dead man . This Nostromo , sir , a man absolutely above reproach , became the terror of all the thieves in the town . We were infested , infested , overrun , sir , here at that time by ladrones and matreros , thieves and murderers from the whole province . On this occasion they had been flocking into Sulaco for a week past . They had scented the end , sir . Fifty per cent . of that murdering mob were professional bandits from the Campo , sir , but there was n't one that had n't heard of Nostromo . As to the town leperos , sir , the sight of his black whiskers and white teeth was enough for them . They quailed before him , sir . That 's what the force of character will do for you . "

His two girls , the eldest fourteen , and the other two years younger , crouched on the sanded floor , on each side of the Signora Teresa , with their heads on their mother 's lap , both scared , but each in her own way , the dark - haired Linda indignant and angry , the fair Giselle , the younger , bewildered and resigned . The Patrona removed her arms , which embraced her daughters , for a moment to cross herself and wring her hands hurriedly . She moaned a little louder . "
7620	7661	7664	7664	woman	5632	" She was not then invoking the saint himself , but calling upon Nostromo , whose patron he was . And Giorgio , motionless on the chair by her side , would be provoked by these reproachful and distracted appeals . "

7749	8509	8512	8513	the traitor	971	" Mrs. Viola was an Italian , too , a native of Spezzia , and though considerably younger than her husband , already middle - aged . She had a handsome face , whose complexion had turned yellow because the climate of Sulaco did not suit her at all . Her voice was a rich contralto . When , with her arms folded tight under her ample bosom , she scolded the squat , thick - legged China girls handling linen , plucking fowls , pounding corn in wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings at the back of the house , she could bring out such an impassioned , vibrating , sepulchral note that the chained watch - dog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle . Luis , a cinnamon - coloured mulatto with a sprouting moustache and thick , dark lips , would stop sweeping the cafe with a broom of palm - leaves to let a gentle shudder run down his spine . His languishing almond eyes would remain closed for a long time . This was the staff of the Casa Viola , but all these people had fled early that morning at the first sounds of the riot , preferring to hide on the plain rather than trust themselves in the house ; a preference for which they were in no way to blame , since , whether true or not , it was generally believed in the town that the Garibaldino had some money buried under the clay floor of the kitchen . The dog , an irritable , shaggy brute , barked violently and whined plaintively in turns at the back , running in and out of his kennel as rage or fear prompted him . Bursts of great shouting rose and died away , like wild gusts of wind on the plain round the barricaded house ; the fitful popping of shots grew louder above the yelling . Sometimes there were intervals of unaccountable stillness outside , and nothing could have been more gaily peaceful than the narrow bright lines of sunlight from the cracks in the shutters , ruled straight across the cafe over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wall opposite . Old Giorgio had chosen that bare , whitewashed room for a retreat . It had only one window , and its only door swung out upon the track of thick dust fenced by aloe hedges between the harbour and the town , where clumsy carts used to creak along behind slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback . In a pause of stillness Giorgio cocked his gun . The ominous sound wrung a low moan from the rigid figure of the woman sitting by his side . A sudden outbreak of defiant yelling quite near the house sank all at once to a confused murmur of growls . Somebody ran along ; the loud catching of his breath was heard for an instant passing the door ; there were hoarse mutters and footsteps near the wall ; a shoulder rubbed against the shutter , effacing the bright lines of sunshine pencilled across the whole breadth of the room . Signora Teresa 's arms thrown about the kneeling forms of her daughters embraced them closer with a convulsive pressure . The mob , driven away from the Custom House , had broken up into several bands , retreating across the plain in the direction of the town . The subdued crash of irregular volleys fired in the distance was answered by faint yells far away . In the intervals the single shots rang feebly , and the low , long , white building blinded in every window seemed to be the centre of a turmoil widening in a great circle about its closed - up silence . But the cautious movements and whispers of a routed party seeking a momentary shelter behind the wall made the darkness of the room , striped by threads of quiet sunlight , alight with evil , stealthy sounds . The Violas had them in their ears as though invisible ghosts hovering about their chairs had consulted in mutters as to the advisability of setting fire to this foreigner 's casa . It was trying to the nerves . Old Viola had risen slowly , gun in hand , irresolute , for he did not see how he could prevent them . Already voices could be heard talking at the back . Signora Teresa was beside herself with terror . "
8518	8525	8515	8516	the traitor	971	" she mumbled , almost inaudibly . "
8554	8751	8752	8752	He	974	" She seemed to think that Nostromo 's mere presence in the house would have made it perfectly safe . So far , she , too , was under the spell of that reputation the Capataz de Cargadores had made for himself by the waterside , along the railway line , with the English and with the populace of Sulaco . To his face , and even against her husband , she invariably affected to laugh it to scorn , sometimes good - naturedly , more often with a curious bitterness . But then women are unreasonable in their opinions , as Giorgio used to remark calmly on fitting occasions . On this occasion , with his gun held at ready before him , he stooped down to his wife 's head , and , keeping his eyes steadfastly on the barricaded door , he breathed out into her ear that Nostromo would have been powerless to help . What could two men shut up in a house do against twenty or more bent upon setting fire to the roof ? Gian ' Battista was thinking of the casa all the time , he was sure . "
8760	8776	8779	8779	him	974	" gasped Signora Viola , crazily . She struck her breast with her open hands . "
8788	8847	8781	8781	He	974	" A discharge of firearms near by made her throw her head back and close her eyes . Old Giorgio set his teeth hard under his white moustache , and his eyes began to roll fiercely . Several bullets struck the end of the wall together ; pieces of plaster could be heard falling outside ; a voice screamed "
8852	8964	8849	8849	they	977	" and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front . Then the tension of old Giorgio 's attitude relaxed , and a smile of contemptuous relief came upon his lips of an old fighter with a leonine face . These were not a people striving for justice , but thieves . Even to defend his life against them was a sort of degradation for a man who had been one of Garibaldi 's immortal thousand in the conquest of Sicily . He had an immense scorn for this outbreak of scoundrels and leperos , who did not know the meaning of the word "
8967	9276	8849	8849	they	977	" He grounded his old gun , and , turning his head , glanced at the coloured lithograph of Garibaldi in a black frame on the white wall ; a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly . His eyes , accustomed to the luminous twilight , made out the high colouring of the face , the red of the shirt , the outlines of the square shoulders , the black patch of the Bersagliere hat with cock 's feathers curling over the crown . An immortal hero ! This was your liberty ; it gave you not only life , but immortality as well ! For that one man his fanaticism had suffered no diminution . In the moment of relief from the apprehension of the greatest danger , perhaps , his family had been exposed to in all their wanderings , he had turned to the picture of his old chief , first and only , then laid his hand on his wife 's shoulder . The children kneeling on the floor had not moved . Signora Teresa opened her eyes a little , as though he had awakened her from a very deep and dreamless slumber . Before he had time in his deliberate way to say a reassuring word she jumped up , with the children clinging to her , one on each side , gasped for breath , and let out a hoarse shriek . It was simultaneous with the bang of a violent blow struck on the outside of the shutter . They could hear suddenly the snorting of a horse , the restive tramping of hoofs on the narrow , hard path in front of the house ; the toe of a boot struck at the shutter again ; a spur jingled at every blow , and an excited voice shouted , "
9284	9315	8849	8849	they	977	" CHAPTER FOUR All the morning Nostromo had kept his eye from afar on the Casa Viola , even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage near the Custom House . "
9324	9330	9317	9317	I	0	" he thought to himself , "
9335	9474	9317	9317	I	0	" Directly the mob had broken he pressed with a small band of Italian workmen in that direction , which , indeed , was the shortest line towards the town . That part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of making a stand under the house ; a volley fired by his followers from behind an aloe hedge made the rascals fly . In a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour branch line Nostromo appeared , mounted on his silver - grey mare . He shouted , sent after them one shot from his revolver , and galloped up to the cafe window . He had an idea that old Giorgio would choose that part of the house for a refuge . His voice had penetrated to them , sounding breathlessly hurried : "
9492	9493	9494	9494	You	979	" "
9497	9515	9494	9494	You	979	" murmured old Viola to his wife . Signora Teresa was silent now . Outside Nostromo laughed . "
9525	9526	9519	9520	the padrona	980	" "
9538	9573	9527	9527	You	979	" cried Signora Teresa . She wanted to say something more , but her voice failed her . Linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment , but old Giorgio shouted apologetically - "
9580	9589	9590	9590	She	980	" Outside Nostromo shouted back with another laugh - "
9596	9603	9590	9590	She	980	" Signora Teresa found her voice . "
9625	9665	9621	9623	Gian ' Battista	275	" They heard him wheel his horse away from the shutters . The party he led were babbling excitedly in Italian and Spanish , inciting each other to the pursuit . He put himself at their head , crying , "
9668	9669	9670	9670	He	275	" "
9690	9696	9621	9623	Gian ' Battista	275	" Signora Teresa said tragically . "
9737	9742	9734	9734	Nostromo	251	" She laughed ominously . "
9766	9867	9753	9753	He	275	" Meantime Giorgio , with tranquil movements , had been unfastening the door ; the flood of light fell on Signora Teresa , with her two girls gathered to her side , a picturesque woman in a pose of maternal exaltation . Behind her the wall was dazzlingly white , and the crude colours of the Garibaldi lithograph paled in the sunshine . Old Viola , at the door , moved his arm upwards as if referring all his quick , fleeting thoughts to the picture of his old chief on the wall . Even when he was cooking for the "
9870	10068	10069	10069	Giorgio	270	" - the engineers he was a famous cook , though the kitchen was a dark place - he was , as it were , under the eye of the great man who had led him in a glorious struggle where , under the walls of Gaeta , tyranny would have expired for ever had it not been for that accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers . When sometimes a frying - pan caught fire during a delicate operation with some shredded onions , and the old man was seen backing out of the doorway , swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloud of smoke , the name of Cavour - the arch intriguer sold to kings and tyrants - could be heard involved in imprecations against the China girls , cooking in general , and the brute of a country where he was reduced to live for the love of liberty that traitor had strangled . Then Signora Teresa , all in black , issuing from another door , advanced , portly and anxious , inclining her fine , black - browed head , opening her arms , and crying in a profound tone - "
10090	10279	10282	10282	Giorgio	270	" At her feet the hens made off in all directions , with immense strides ; if there were any engineers from up the line staying in Sulaco , a young English face or two would appear at the billiard - room occupying one end of the house ; but at the other end , in the cafe , Luis , the mulatto , took good care not to show himself . The Indian girls , with hair like flowing black manes , and dressed only in a shift and short petticoat , stared dully from under the square - cut fringes on their foreheads ; the noisy frizzling of fat had stopped , the fumes floated upwards in sunshine , a strong smell of burnt onions hung in the drowsy heat , enveloping the house ; and the eye lost itself in a vast flat expanse of grass to the west , as if the plain between the Sierra overtopping Sulaco and the coast range away there towards Esmeralda had been as big as half the world . Signora Teresa , after an impressive pause , remonstrated - "
10315	10517	10518	10518	You	993	" And while she looked at him she would sometimes put her hand hastily to her side with a short twitch of her fine lips and a knitting of her black , straight eyebrows like a flicker of angry pain or an angry thought on her handsome , regular features . It was pain ; she suppressed the twinge . It had come to her first a few years after they had left Italy to emigrate to America and settle at last in Sulaco after wandering from town to town , trying shopkeeping in a small way here and there ; and once an organized enterprise of fishing - in Maldonado - for Giorgio , like the great Garibaldi , had been a sailor in his time . Sometimes she had no patience with pain . For years its gnawing had been part of the landscape embracing the glitter of the harbour under the wooded spurs of the range ; and the sunshine itself was heavy and dull - heavy with pain - not like the sunshine of her girlhood , in which middle - aged Giorgio had wooed her gravely and passionately on the shores of the gulf of Spezzia . "
10526	10530	10524	10524	Giorgio	270	" she directed . "
10554	10555	10546	10548	four Signori Inglesi	288	" "
10562	10606	10546	10548	four Signori Inglesi	288	" Giorgio would mutter . He obeyed . The Signori Inglesi would require their midday meal presently . He had been one of the immortal and invincible band of liberators who had made the mercenaries of tyranny fly like chaff before a hurricane , "
10611	11254	10546	10548	four Signori Inglesi	288	" But that was before he was married and had children ; and before tyranny had reared its head again amongst the traitors who had imprisoned Garibaldi , his hero . There were three doors in the front of the house , and each afternoon the Garibaldino could be seen at one or another of them with his big bush of white hair , his arms folded , his legs crossed , leaning back his leonine head against the side , and looking up the wooded slopes of the foothills at the snowy dome of Higuerota . The front of his house threw off a black long rectangle of shade , broadening slowly over the soft ox - cart track . Through the gaps , chopped out in the oleander hedges , the harbour branch railway , laid out temporarily on the level of the plain , curved away its shining parallel ribbons on a belt of scorched and withered grass within sixty yards of the end of the house . In the evening the empty material trains of flat cars circled round the dark green grove of Sulaco , and ran , undulating slightly with white jets of steam , over the plain towards the Casa Viola , on their way to the railway yards by the harbour . The Italian drivers saluted him from the foot - plate with raised hand , while the negro brakesmen sat carelessly on the brakes , looking straight forward , with the rims of their big hats flapping in the wind . In return Giorgio would give a slight sideways jerk of the head , without unfolding his arms . On this memorable day of the riot his arms were not folded on his chest . His hand grasped the barrel of the gun grounded on the threshold ; he did not look up once at the white dome of Higuerota , whose cool purity seemed to hold itself aloof from a hot earth . His eyes examined the plain curiously . Tall trails of dust subsided here and there . In a speckless sky the sun hung clear and blinding . Knots of men ran headlong ; others made a stand ; and the irregular rattle of firearms came rippling to his ears in the fiery , still air . Single figures on foot raced desperately . Horsemen galloped towards each other , wheeled round together , separated at speed . Giorgio saw one fall , rider and horse disappearing as if they had galloped into a chasm , and the movements of the animated scene were like the passages of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs mounted and on foot , yelling with tiny throats , under the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment of silence . Never before had Giorgio seen this bit of plain so full of active life ; his gaze could not take in all its details at once ; he shaded his eyes with his hand , till suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near by startled him . A troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock of the Railway Company . They came on like a whirlwind , and dashed over the line snorting , kicking , squealing in a compact , piebald , tossing mob of bay , brown , grey backs , eyes staring , necks extended , nostrils red , long tails streaming . As soon as they had leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from under their hoofs , and within six yards of Giorgio only a brown cloud with vague forms of necks and cruppers rolled by , making the soil tremble on its passage . Viola coughed , turning his face away from the dust , and shaking his head slightly . "
11270	11439	10546	10548	four Signori Inglesi	288	" he muttered . In the square of sunlight falling through the door Signora Teresa , kneeling before the chair , had bowed her head , heavy with a twisted mass of ebony hair streaked with silver , into the palm of her hands . The black lace shawl she used to drape about her face had dropped to the ground by her side . The two girls had got up , hand - in - hand , in short skirts , their loose hair falling in disorder . The younger had thrown her arm across her eyes , as if afraid to face the light . Linda , with her hand on the other 's shoulder , stared fearlessly . Viola looked at his children . The sun brought out the deep lines on his face , and , energetic in expression , it had the immobility of a carving . It was impossible to discover what he thought . Bushy grey eyebrows shaded his dark glance . "
11451	11535	11536	11536	Mother	290	" Linda pouted , advancing her red lips , which were almost too red ; but she had admirable eyes , brown , with a sparkle of gold in the irises , full of intelligence and meaning , and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow upon her thin , colourless face . There were bronze glints in the sombre clusters of her hair , and the eyelashes , long and coal black , made her complexion appear still more pale . "
11577	11609	11560	11560	I	0	" She said all this quickly , with great assurance , in an animated , penetrating voice . Then , giving her sister 's shoulder a slight shake , she added - "
11621	11622	11611	11611	she	290	" "
11626	11632	11611	11611	she	290	" inquired Giorgio , gravely . "
11639	11640	11641	11641	She	290	" "
11645	11656	11641	11641	She	290	" said Linda , with a little burst of laughter . "
11698	11699	11694	11694	She	290	" "
11710	11725	11726	11726	Nobody	976	" the father pronounced , slowly . She tossed back all her dark hair . "
11732	12122	11726	11726	Nobody	976	" Old Giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully . There was two years difference between them . They had been born to him late , years after the boy had died . Had he lived he would have been nearly as old as Gian ' Battista - he whom the English called Nostromo ; but as to his daughters , the severity of his temper , his advancing age , his absorption in his memories , had prevented his taking much notice of them . He loved his children , but girls belong more to the mother , and much of his affection had been expended in the worship and service of liberty . When quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading to La Plata , to enlist in the navy of Montevideo , then under the command of Garibaldi . Afterwards , in the Italian legion of the Republic struggling against the encroaching tyranny of Rosas , he had taken part , on great plains , on the banks of immense rivers , in the fiercest fighting perhaps the world had ever known . He had lived amongst men who had declaimed about liberty , suffered for liberty , died for liberty , with a desperate exaltation , and with their eyes turned towards an oppressed Italy . His own enthusiasm had been fed on scenes of carnage , on the examples of lofty devotion , on the din of armed struggle , on the inflamed language of proclamations . He had never parted from the chief of his choice - the fiery apostle of independence - keeping by his side in America and in Italy till after the fatal day of Aspromonte , when the treachery of kings , emperors , and ministers had been revealed to the world in the wounding and imprisonment of his hero - a catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomy doubt of ever being able to understand the ways of Divine justice . He did not deny it , however . It required patience , he would say . Though he disliked priests , and would not put his foot inside a church for anything , he believed in God . Were not the proclamations against tyrants addressed to the peoples in the name of God and liberty ? "
12131	12951	12952	12952	We	1007	" he muttered sometimes . In Sicily , an Englishman who had turned up in Palermo after its evacuation by the army of the king , had given him a Bible in Italian - the publication of the British and Foreign Bible Society , bound in a dark leather cover . In periods of political adversity , in the pauses of silence when the revolutionists issued no proclamations , Giorgio earned his living with the first work that came to hand - as sailor , as dock labourer on the quays of Genoa , once as a hand on a farm in the hills above Spezzia - and in his spare time he studied the thick volume . He carried it with him into battles . Now it was his only reading , and in order not to be deprived of it the print was small he had consented to accept the present of a pair of silver - mounted spectacles from Senora Emilia Gould , the wife of the Englishman who managed the silver mine in the mountains three leagues from the town . She was the only Englishwoman in Sulaco . Giorgio Viola had a great consideration for the English . This feeling , born on the battlefields of Uruguay , was forty years old at the very least . Several of them had poured their blood for the cause of freedom in America , and the first he had ever known he remembered by the name of Samuel ; he commanded a negro company under Garibaldi , during the famous siege of Montevideo , and died heroically with his negroes at the fording of the Boyana . He , Giorgio , had reached the rank of ensign - alferez - and cooked for the general . Later , in Italy , he , with the rank of lieutenant , rode with the staff and still cooked for the general . He had cooked for him in Lombardy through the whole campaign ; on the march to Rome he had lassoed his beef in the Campagna after the American manner ; he had been wounded in the defence of the Roman Republic ; he was one of the four fugitives who , with the general , carried out of the woods the inanimate body of the general 's wife into the farmhouse where she died , exhausted by the hardships of that terrible retreat . He had survived that disastrous time to attend his general in Palermo when the Neapolitan shells from the castle crashed upon the town . He had cooked for him on the field of Volturno after fighting all day . And everywhere he had seen Englishmen in the front rank of the army of freedom . He respected their nation because they loved Garibaldi . Their very countesses and princesses had kissed the general 's hands in London , it was said . He could well believe it ; for the nation was noble , and the man was a saint . It was enough to look once at his face to see the divine force of faith in him and his great pity for all that was poor , suffering , and oppressed in this world . The spirit of self - forgetfulness , the simple devotion to a vast humanitarian idea which inspired the thought and stress of that revolutionary time , had left its mark upon Giorgio in a sort of austere contempt for all personal advantage . This man , whom the lowest class in Sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in his kitchen , had all his life despised money . The leaders of his youth had lived poor , had died poor . It had been a habit of his mind to disregard to - morrow . It was engendered partly by an existence of excitement , adventure , and wild warfare . But mostly it was a matter of principle . It did not resemble the carelessness of a condottiere , it was a puritanism of conduct , born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion . This stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon Giorgio 's old age . It cast a gloom because the cause seemed lost . Too many kings and emperors flourished yet in the world which God had meant for the people . He was sad because of his simplicity . Though always ready to help his countrymen , and greatly respected by the Italian emigrants wherever he lived in his exile he called it , he could not conceal from himself that they cared nothing for the wrongs of down - trodden nations . They listened to his tales of war readily , but seemed to ask themselves what he had got out of it after all . There was nothing that they could see . "
12965	13031	12952	12952	We	1007	" he cried out furiously sometimes , and the powerful voice , the blazing eyes , the shaking of the white mane , the brown , sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call heaven to witness , impressed his hearers . After the old man had broken off abruptly with a jerk of the head and a movement of the arm , meaning clearly , "
13042	13067	13040	13040	you	1008	" they nudged each other . There was in old Giorgio an energy of feeling , a personal quality of conviction , something they called "
13069	13071	12952	12952	We	1007	" - "
13076	13461	12952	12952	We	1007	" they used to say of him . Some slight incident , a chance word would set him off talking on the beach to the Italian fishermen of Maldonado , in the little shop he kept afterwards in Valparaiso to his countrymen customers ; of an evening , suddenly , in the cafe at one end of the Casa Viola the other was reserved for the English engineers to the select clientele of engine - drivers and foremen of the railway shops . With their handsome , bronzed , lean faces , shiny black ringlets , glistening eyes , broad - chested , bearded , sometimes a tiny gold ring in the lobe of the ear , the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him , turning away from their cards or dominoes . Here and there a fair - haired Basque studied his hand meantime , waiting without protest . No native of Costaguana intruded there . This was the Italian stronghold . Even the Sulaco policemen on a night patrol let their horses pace softly by , bending low in the saddle to glance through the window at the heads in a fog of smoke ; and the drone of old Giorgio 's declamatory narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain . Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police , some broad - faced , brown little gentleman , with a great deal of Indian in him , would put in an appearance . Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced with a confident , sly smile , and without a word up to the long trestle table . He pointed to one of the bottles on the shelf ; Giorgio , thrusting his pipe into his mouth abruptly , served him in person . Nothing would be heard but the slight jingle of the spurs . His glass emptied , he would take a leisurely , scrutinizing look all round the room , go out , and ride away slowly , circling towards the town . CHAPTER FIVE In this way only was the power of the local authorities vindicated amongst the great body of strong - limbed foreigners who dug the earth , blasted the rocks , drove the engines for the "
13467	13977	13978	13978	We	1009	" In these very words eighteen months before the Excellentissimo Senor don Vincente Ribiera , the Dictator of Costaguana , had described the National Central Railway in his great speech at the turning of the first sod . He had come on purpose to Sulaco , and there was a one - o'clock dinner - party , a convite offered by the O.S.N. Company on board the Juno after the function on shore . Captain Mitchell had himself steered the cargo lighter , all draped with flags , which , in tow of the Juno 's steam launch , took the Excellentissimo from the jetty to the ship . Everybody of note in Sulaco had been invited - the one or two foreign merchants , all the representatives of the old Spanish families then in town , the great owners of estates on the plain , grave , courteous , simple men , caballeros of pure descent , with small hands and feet , conservative , hospitable , and kind . The Occidental Province was their stronghold ; their Blanco party had triumphed now ; it was their President - Dictator , a Blanco of the Blancos , who sat smiling urbanely between the representatives of two friendly foreign powers . They had come with him from Sta . Marta to countenance by their presence the enterprise in which the capital of their countries was engaged . The only lady of that company was Mrs. Gould , the wife of Don Carlos , the administrator of the San Tome silver mine . The ladies of Sulaco were not advanced enough to take part in the public life to that extent . They had come out strongly at the great ball at the Intendencia the evening before , but Mrs. Gould alone had appeared , a bright spot in the group of black coats behind the President - Dictator , on the crimson cloth - covered stage erected under a shady tree on the shore of the harbour , where the ceremony of turning the first sod had taken place . She had come off in the cargo lighter , full of notabilities , sitting under the flutter of gay flags , in the place of honour by the side of Captain Mitchell , who steered , and her clear dress gave the only truly festive note to the sombre gathering in the long , gorgeous saloon of the Juno . The head of the chairman of the railway board from London , handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white hair and clipped beard , hovered near her shoulder attentive , smiling , and fatigued . The journey from London to Sta . Marta in mail boats and the special carriages of the Sta . Marta coast - line the only railway so far had been tolerable - even pleasant - quite tolerable . But the trip over the mountains to Sulaco was another sort of experience , in an old diligencia over impassable roads skirting awful precipices . "
13994	14004	13978	13978	We	1009	" he was telling Mrs. Gould in an undertone . "
14048	14049	13978	13978	We	1009	" "
14082	14089	14090	14090	I	0	" she instructed him with animation . "
14107	14108	14102	14102	You	1012	" "
14132	14133	14126	14128	an old resident	1018	" "
14140	14167	14137	14137	I	0	" he murmured , looking at her with a slight smile . Mrs. Gould 's appearance was made youthful by the mobile intelligence of her face . "
14273	15280	16283	16283	Gould	250	" While he talked in a slow , humorous tone , she kept her little smile . Agreeing ironically , she assured him that certainly not - nothing ever happened in Sulaco . Even the revolutions , of which there had been two in her time , had respected the repose of the place . Their course ran in the more populous southern parts of the Republic , and the great valley of Sta . Marta , which was like one great battlefield of the parties , with the possession of the capital for a prize and an outlet to another ocean . They were more advanced over there . Here in Sulaco they heard only the echoes of these great questions , and , of course , their official world changed each time , coming to them over their rampart of mountains which he himself had traversed in an old diligencia , with such a risk to life and limb . The chairman of the railway had been enjoying her hospitality for several days , and he was really grateful for it . It was only since he had left Sta . Marta that he had utterly lost touch with the feeling of European life on the background of his exotic surroundings . In the capital he had been the guest of the Legation , and had been kept busy negotiating with the members of Don Vincente 's Government - cultured men , men to whom the conditions of civilized business were not unknown . What concerned him most at the time was the acquisition of land for the railway . In the Sta . Marta Valley , where there was already one line in existence , the people were tractable , and it was only a matter of price . A commission had been nominated to fix the values , and the difficulty resolved itself into the judicious influencing of the Commissioners . But in Sulaco - the Occidental Province for whose very development the railway was intended - there had been trouble . It had been lying for ages ensconced behind its natural barriers , repelling modern enterprise by the precipices of its mountain range , by its shallow harbour opening into the everlasting calms of a gulf full of clouds , by the benighted state of mind of the owners of its fertile territory - all these aristocratic old Spanish families , all those Don Ambrosios this and Don Fernandos that , who seemed actually to dislike and distrust the coming of the railway over their lands . It had happened that some of the surveying parties scattered all over the province had been warned off with threats of violence . In other cases outrageous pretensions as to price had been raised . But the man of railways prided himself on being equal to every emergency . Since he was met by the inimical sentiment of blind conservatism in Sulaco he would meet it by sentiment , too , before taking his stand on his right alone . The Government was bound to carry out its part of the contract with the board of the new railway company , even if it had to use force for the purpose . But he desired nothing less than an armed disturbance in the smooth working of his plans . They were much too vast and far - reaching , and too promising to leave a stone unturned ; and so he imagined to get the President - Dictator over there on a tour of ceremonies and speeches , culminating in a great function at the turning of the first sod by the harbour shore . After all he was their own creature - that Don Vincente . He was the embodied triumph of the best elements in the State . These were facts , and , unless facts meant nothing , Sir John argued to himself , such a man 's influence must be real , and his personal action would produce the conciliatory effect he required . He had succeeded in arranging the trip with the help of a very clever advocate , who was known in Sta . Marta as the agent of the Gould silver mine , the biggest thing in Sulaco , and even in the whole Republic . It was indeed a fabulously rich mine . Its so - called agent , evidently a man of culture and ability , seemed , without official position , to possess an extraordinary influence in the highest Government spheres . He was able to assure Sir John that the President - Dictator would make the journey . He regretted , however , in the course of the same conversation , that General Montero insisted upon going , too . General Montero , whom the beginning of the struggle had found an obscure army captain employed on the wild eastern frontier of the State , had thrown in his lot with the Ribiera party at a moment when special circumstances had given that small adhesion a fortuitous importance . The fortunes of war served him marvellously , and the victory of Rio Seco after a day of desperate fighting put a seal to his success . At the end he emerged General , Minister of War , and the military head of the Blanco party , although there was nothing aristocratic in his descent . Indeed , it was said that he and his brother , orphans , had been brought up by the munificence of a famous European traveller , in whose service their father had lost his life . Another story was that their father had been nothing but a charcoal burner in the woods , and their mother a baptised Indian woman from the far interior . However that might be , the Costaguana Press was in the habit of styling Montero 's forest march from his commandancia to join the Blanco forces at the beginning of the troubles , the "
15289	16109	16110	16110	We	1027	" About the same time , too , his brother had turned up from Europe , where he had gone apparently as secretary to a consul . Having , however , collected a small band of outlaws , he showed some talent as guerilla chief and had been rewarded at the pacification by the post of Military Commandant of the capital . The Minister of War , then , accompanied the Dictator . The board of the O.S.N. Company , working hand - in - hand with the railway people for the good of the Republic , had on this important occasion instructed Captain Mitchell to put the mail - boat Juno at the disposal of the distinguished party . Don Vincente , journeying south from Sta . Marta , had embarked at Cayta , the principal port of Costaguana , and came to Sulaco by sea . But the chairman of the railway company had courageously crossed the mountains in a ramshackle diligencia , mainly for the purpose of meeting his engineer - in - chief engaged in the final survey of the road . For all the indifference of a man of affairs to nature , whose hostility can always be overcome by the resources of finance , he could not help being impressed by his surroundings during his halt at the surveying camp established at the highest point his railway was to reach . He spent the night there , arriving just too late to see the last dying glow of sunlight upon the snowy flank of Higuerota . Pillared masses of black basalt framed like an open portal a portion of the white field lying aslant against the west . In the transparent air of the high altitudes everything seemed very near , steeped in a clear stillness as in an imponderable liquid ; and with his ear ready to catch the first sound of the expected diligencia the engineer - in - chief , at the door of a hut of rough stones , had contemplated the changing hues on the enormous side of the mountain , thinking that in this sight , as in a piece of inspired music , there could be found together the utmost delicacy of shaded expression and a stupendous magnificence of effect . Sir John arrived too late to hear the magnificent and inaudible strain sung by the sunset amongst the high peaks of the Sierra . It had sung itself out into the breathless pause of deep dusk before , climbing down the fore wheel of the diligencia with stiff limbs , he shook hands with the engineer . They gave him his dinner in a stone hut like a cubical boulder , with no door or windows in its two openings ; a bright fire of sticks brought on muleback from the first valley below burning outside , sent in a wavering glare ; and two candles in tin candlesticks - lighted , it was explained to him , in his honour - stood on a sort of rough camp table , at which he sat on the right hand of the chief . He knew how to be amiable ; and the young men of the engineering staff , for whom the surveying of the railway track had the glamour of the first steps on the path of life , sat there , too , listening modestly , with their smooth faces tanned by the weather , and very pleased to witness so much affability in so great a man . Afterwards , late at night , pacing to and fro outside , he had a long talk with his chief engineer . He knew him well of old . This was not the first undertaking in which their gifts , as elementally different as fire and water , had worked in conjunction . From the contact of these two personalities , who had not the same vision of the world , there was generated a power for the world 's service - a subtle force that could set in motion mighty machines , men 's muscles , and awaken also in human breasts an unbounded devotion to the task . Of the young fellows at the table , to whom the survey of the track was like the tracing of the path of life , more than one would be called to meet death before the work was done . But the work would be done : the force would be almost as strong as a faith . Not quite , however . In the silence of the sleeping camp upon the moonlit plateau forming the top of the pass like the floor of a vast arena surrounded by the basalt walls of precipices , two strolling figures in thick ulsters stood still , and the voice of the engineer pronounced distinctly the words - "
16116	16278	16283	16283	Gould	250	" Sir John , raising his head to follow the pointing gesture , felt the full force of the words . The white Higuerota soared out of the shadows of rock and earth like a frozen bubble under the moon . All was still , till near by , behind the wall of a corral for the camp animals , built roughly of loose stones in the form of a circle , a pack mule stamped his forefoot and blew heavily twice . The engineer - in - chief had used the phrase in answer to the chairman 's tentative suggestion that the tracing of the line could , perhaps , be altered in deference to the prejudices of the Sulaco landowners . The chief engineer believed that the obstinacy of men was the lesser obstacle . Moreover , to combat that they had the great influence of Charles Gould , whereas tunnelling under Higuerota would have been a colossal undertaking . "
16293	16360	16361	16361	They	1030	" Sir John had heard much of Charles Gould in Sta . Marta , and wanted to know more . The engineer - in - chief assured him that the administrator of the San Tome silver mine had an immense influence over all these Spanish Dons . He had also one of the best houses in Sulaco , and the Gould hospitality was beyond all praise . "
16373	16377	16361	16361	They	1030	" he said . "
16506	16567	16568	16568	I	0	" He interrupted himself as , from before one of the little fires burning outside the low wall of the corral , arose the figure of a man wrapped in a poncho up to the neck . The saddle which he had been using for a pillow made a dark patch on the ground against the red glow of embers . "
16581	16586	16572	16572	himself	305	" said Sir John . "
16599	16664	16591	16591	he	0	" The man who , perhaps disturbed by the proximity of the voices , had arisen from the ground , struck a match to light a cigarette . The flame showed a bronzed , black - whiskered face , a pair of eyes gazing straight ; then , rearranging his wrappings , he sank full length and laid his head again on the saddle . "
16694	16699	16700	16703	A most useful fellow	1041	" said the engineer . "
16814	16956	16794	16794	He	267	" This camp - master was the Italian sailor whom all the Europeans in Sulaco , following Captain Mitchell 's mispronunciation , were in the habit of calling Nostromo . And indeed , taciturn and ready , he did take excellent care of his charge at the bad parts of the road , as Sir John himself acknowledged to Mrs. Gould afterwards . CHAPTER SIX At that time Nostromo had been already long enough in the country to raise to the highest pitch Captain Mitchell 's opinion of the extraordinary value of his discovery . Clearly he was one of those invaluable subordinates whom to possess is a legitimate cause of boasting . Captain Mitchell plumed himself upon his eye for men - but he was not selfish - and in the innocence of his pride was already developing that mania for "
16963	17001	17002	17003	The fellow	537	" which was to bring Nostromo into personal contact , sooner or later , with every European in Sulaco , as a sort of universal factotum - a prodigy of efficiency in his own sphere of life . "
17013	17164	17002	17003	The fellow	537	" Captain Mitchell was given to affirm ; and though nobody , perhaps , could have explained why it should be so , it was impossible on a survey of their relation to throw doubt on that statement , unless , indeed , one were a bitter , eccentric character like Dr. Monygham - for instance - whose short , hopeless laugh expressed somehow an immense mistrust of mankind . Not that Dr. Monygham was a prodigal either of laughter or of words . He was bitterly taciturn when at his best . At his worst people feared the open scornfulness of his tongue . Only Mrs. Gould could keep his unbelief in men 's motives within due bounds ; but even to her on an occasion not connected with Nostromo , and in a tone which for him was gentle , even to her , he had said once , "
17193	17390	17002	17003	The fellow	537	" And Mrs. Gould had hastened to drop the subject . There were strange rumours of the English doctor . Years ago , in the time of Guzman Bento , he had been mixed up , it was whispered , in a conspiracy which was betrayed and , as people expressed it , drowned in blood . His hair had turned grey , his hairless , seamed face was of a brick - dust colour ; the large check pattern of his flannel shirt and his old stained Panama hat were an established defiance to the conventionalities of Sulaco . Had it not been for the immaculate cleanliness of his apparel he might have been taken for one of those shiftless Europeans that are a moral eyesore to the respectability of a foreign colony in almost every exotic part of the world . The young ladies of Sulaco , adorning with clusters of pretty faces the balconies along the Street of the Constitution , when they saw him pass , with his limping gait and bowed head , a short linen jacket drawn on carelessly over the flannel check shirt , would remark to each other , "
17411	17450	17403	17403	He	1056	" The inference was true . Its deeper meaning was hidden from their simple intelligence . Moreover , they expended no store of thought on the doctor . He was old , ugly , learned - and a little "
17452	17799	17393	17395	the Senor doctor	1056	" - mad , if not a bit of a sorcerer , as the common people suspected him of being . The little white jacket was in reality a concession to Mrs. Gould 's humanizing influence . The doctor , with his habit of sceptical , bitter speech , had no other means of showing his profound respect for the character of the woman who was known in the country as the English Senora . He presented this tribute very seriously indeed ; it was no trifle for a man of his habits . Mrs. Gould felt that , too , perfectly . She would never have thought of imposing upon him this marked show of deference . She kept her old Spanish house one of the finest specimens in Sulaco open for the dispensation of the small graces of existence . She dispensed them with simplicity and charm because she was guided by an alert perception of values . She was highly gifted in the art of human intercourse which consists in delicate shades of self - forgetfulness and in the suggestion of universal comprehension . Charles Gould the Gould family , established in Costaguana for three generations , always went to England for their education and for their wives imagined that he had fallen in love with a girl 's sound common sense like any other man , but these were not exactly the reasons why , for instance , the whole surveying camp , from the youngest of the young men to their mature chief , should have found occasion to allude to Mrs. Gould 's house so frequently amongst the high peaks of the Sierra . She would have protested that she had done nothing for them , with a low laugh and a surprised widening of her grey eyes , had anybody told her how convincingly she was remembered on the edge of the snow - line above Sulaco . But directly , with a little capable air of setting her wits to work , she would have found an explanation . "
17837	18819	18822	18822	his	1059	" She was always sorry for homesick people . Born in the country , as his father before him , spare and tall , with a flaming moustache , a neat chin , clear blue eyes , auburn hair , and a thin , fresh , red face , Charles Gould looked like a new arrival from over the sea . His grandfather had fought in the cause of independence under Bolivar , in that famous English legion which on the battlefield of Carabobo had been saluted by the great Liberator as Saviours of his country . One of Charles Gould 's uncles had been the elected President of that very province of Sulaco then called a State in the days of Federation , and afterwards had been put up against the wall of a church and shot by the order of the barbarous Unionist general , Guzman Bento . It was the same Guzman Bento who , becoming later Perpetual President , famed for his ruthless and cruel tyranny , readied his apotheosis in the popular legend of a sanguinary land - haunting spectre whose body had been carried off by the devil in person from the brick mausoleum in the nave of the Church of Assumption in Sta . Marta . Thus , at least , the priests explained its disappearance to the barefooted multitude that streamed in , awestruck , to gaze at the hole in the side of the ugly box of bricks before the great altar . Guzman Bento of cruel memory had put to death great numbers of people besides Charles Gould 's uncle ; but with a relative martyred in the cause of aristocracy , the Sulaco Oligarchs this was the phraseology of Guzman Bento 's time ; now they were called Blancos , and had given up the federal idea , which meant the families of pure Spanish descent , considered Charles as one of themselves . With such a family record , no one could be more of a Costaguanero than Don Carlos Gould ; but his aspect was so characteristic that in the talk of common people he was just the Inglez - the Englishman of Sulaco . He looked more English than a casual tourist , a sort of heretic pilgrim , however , quite unknown in Sulaco . He looked more English than the last arrived batch of young railway engineers , than anybody out of the hunting - field pictures in the numbers of Punch reaching his wife 's drawing - room two months or so after date . It astonished you to hear him talk Spanish Castillan , as the natives say or the Indian dialect of the country - people so naturally . His accent had never been English ; but there was something so indelible in all these ancestral Goulds - liberators , explorers , coffee planters , merchants , revolutionists - of Costaguana , that he , the only representative of the third generation in a continent possessing its own style of horsemanship , went on looking thoroughly English even on horseback . This is not said of him in the mocking spirit of the Llaneros - men of the great plains - who think that no one in the world knows how to sit a horse but themselves . Charles Gould , to use the suitably lofty phrase , rode like a centaur . Riding for him was not a special form of exercise ; it was a natural faculty , as walking straight is to all men sound of mind and limb ; but , all the same , when cantering beside the rutty ox - cart track to the mine he looked in his English clothes and with his imported saddlery as though he had come this moment to Costaguana at his easy swift pasotrote , straight out of some green meadow at the other side of the world . His way would lie along the old Spanish road - the Camino Real of popular speech - the only remaining vestige of a fact and name left by that royalty old Giorgio Viola hated , and whose very shadow had departed from the land ; for the big equestrian statue of Charles IV . at the entrance of the Alameda , towering white against the trees , was only known to the folk from the country and to the beggars of the town that slept on the steps around the pedestal , as the Horse of Stone . The other Carlos , turning off to the left with a rapid clatter of hoofs on the disjointed pavement - Don Carlos Gould , in his English clothes , looked as incongruous , but much more at home than the kingly cavalier reining in his steed on the pedestal above the sleeping leperos , with his marble arm raised towards the marble rim of a plumed hat . The weather - stained effigy of the mounted king , with its vague suggestion of a saluting gesture , seemed to present an inscrutable breast to the political changes which had robbed it of its very name ; but neither did the other horseman , well known to the people , keen and alive on his well - shaped , slate - coloured beast with a white eye , wear his heart on the sleeve of his English coat . His mind preserved its steady poise as if sheltered in the passionless stability of private and public decencies at home in Europe . He accepted with a like calm the shocking manner in which the Sulaco ladies smothered their faces with pearl powder till they looked like white plaster casts with beautiful living eyes , the peculiar gossip of the town , and the continuous political changes , the constant ' saving of the country , "
18931	18945	18925	18925	he	314	" My dear , you seem to forget that I was born here . "
19430	19459	19426	19426	he	247	" Carlos , my friend , you have ridden from San Tome in the heat of the day . Always the true English activity . No ? What ? "

20046	20115	19968	19969	a man	771	" The chief of the State has resolved to exercise to the full his power of clemency . The mine , which by every law , international , human , and divine , reverts now to the Government as national property , shall remain closed till the sword drawn for the sacred defence of liberal principles has accomplished its mission of securing the happiness of our beloved country .

20988	21035	21045	21045	she	1153	" No ; it 's no go . Pas moyen , mon garcon . C'est dommage , tout de meme . Ah ! zut ! Je ne vole pas mon monde . Je ne suis pas ministre - moi ! Vous pouvez emporter votre petit sac . "

22945	22959	22960	22960	he	250	" I fancy that this is not the kind of handling it requires , "
23001	23012	22988	22988	Charles	250	" You must not forget that he was born there . "
23047	23060	23061	23061	He	250	" Well , and you ? You were born there , too . "
23066	23095	23096	23096	She	322	" That 's different . I 've been away ten years . Dad never had such a long spell ; and it was more than thirty years ago . "

23420	23435	23415	23415	he	250	" I 've come to you - I 've come straight to you - , "
23495	23499	23483	23483	she	322	" Poor boy , "
23574	23590	23570	23570	he	250	" Yes . But if he had only grappled with it in a proper way ! "
23835	23878	23887	23887	he	250	" Well , yes . It was iniquitous . They corrupted him thoroughly , the poor old boy . Oh ! why would n't he let me go back to him ? But now I shall know how to grapple with this . "
24116	24229	24100	24100	she	322	" It 's lucky that we shall be able to settle in a coast town . You 've heard its name . It is Sulaco . I am so glad poor father did get that house . He bought a big house there years ago , in order that there should always be a Casa Gould in the principal town of what used to be called the Occidental Province . I lived there once , as a small boy , with my dear mother , for a whole year , while poor father was away in the United States on business . You shall be the new mistress of the Casa Gould . "
24259	24424	24255	24255	he	1277	" The name of Gould has been always highly respected in Sulaco . My uncle Harry was chief of the State for some time , and has left a great name amongst the first families . By this I mean the pure Creole families , who take no part in the miserable farce of governments . Uncle Harry was no adventurer . In Costaguana we Goulds are no adventurers . He was of the country , and he loved it , but he remained essentially an Englishman in his ideas . He made use of the political cry of his time . It was Federation . But he was no politician . He simply stood up for social order out of pure love for rational liberty and from his hate of oppression . There was no nonsense about him . He went to work in his own way because it seemed right , just as I feel I must lay hold of that mine . "
25340	25352	25353	25354	Mrs. Gould	248	" They still look upon me as something of a monster , "
25546	25639	25532	25532	her	248	" However , the Goulds were in essentials a reticent couple , and their guests departed without the suspicion of any other purpose but simple profit in the working of a silver mine . Mrs. Gould had out her own carriage , with two white mules , to drive them down to the harbour , whence the Ceres was to carry them off into the Olympus of plutocrats . Captain Mitchell had snatched at the occasion of leave - taking to remark to Mrs. Gould , in a low , confidential mutter , "
25645	26082	25532	25532	her	248	" Mrs. Gould loved the patio of her Spanish house . A broad flight of stone steps was overlooked silently from a niche in the wall by a Madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on her arm . Subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the paved well of the quadrangle , with the stamping of horses and mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern . A tangle of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow , blade - like leaves over the square pool of water , and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge , holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand . Barefooted servants passed to and fro , issuing from dark , low doorways below ; two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen ; the baker with the tray of bread made for the day ; Leonarda - her own camerista - bearing high up , swung from her hand raised above her raven black head , a bunch of starched under - skirts dazzlingly white in the slant of sunshine . Then the old porter would hobble in , sweeping the flagstones , and the house was ready for the day . All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened into each other and into the corredor , with its wrought - iron railings and a border of flowers , whence , like the lady of the mediaeval castle , she could witness from above all the departures and arrivals of the Casa , to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of stately importance . She had watched her carriage roll away with the three guests from the north . She smiled . Their three arms went up simultaneously to their three hats . Captain Mitchell , the fourth , in attendance , had already begun a pompous discourse . Then she lingered . She lingered , approaching her face to the clusters of flowers here and there as if to give time to her thoughts to catch up with her slow footsteps along the straight vista of the corredor . A fringed Indian hammock from Aroa , gay with coloured featherwork , had been swung judiciously in a corner that caught the early sun ; for the mornings are cool in Sulaco . The cluster of flor de noche buena blazed in great masses before the open glass doors of the reception rooms . A big green parrot , brilliant like an emerald in a cage that flashed like gold , screamed out ferociously , "
26086	26092	26093	26093	Leonarda	327	" then called twice mellifluously , "
26097	26415	26095	26095	Leonarda	327	" in imitation of Mrs. Gould 's voice , and suddenly took refuge in immobility and silence . Mrs. Gould reached the end of the gallery and put her head through the door of her husband 's room . Charles Gould , with one foot on a low wooden stool , was already strapping his spurs . He wanted to hurry back to the mine . Mrs. Gould , without coming in , glanced about the room . One tall , broad bookcase , with glass doors , was full of books ; but in the other , without shelves , and lined with red baize , were arranged firearms : Winchester carbines , revolvers , a couple of shot - guns , and even two pairs of double - barrelled holster pistols . Between them , by itself , upon a strip of scarlet velvet , hung an old cavalry sabre , once the property of Don Enrique Gould , the hero of the Occidental Province , presented by Don Jose Avellanos , the hereditary friend of the family . Otherwise , the plastered white walls were completely bare , except for a water - colour sketch of the San Tome mountain - the work of Dona Emilia herself . In the middle of the red - tiled floor stood two long tables littered with plans and papers , a few chairs , and a glass show - case containing specimens of ore from the mine . Mrs. Gould , looking at all these things in turn , wondered aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects , the working , and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy , whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction . And dropping her eyelids expressively , she added - "
26425	26495	26418	26418	you	1340	" Then , surprised at her husband 's silence , she raised her eyes , opened wide , as pretty as pale flowers . He had done with the spurs , and , twisting his moustache with both hands , horizontally , he contemplated her from the height of his long legs with a visible appreciation of her appearance . The consciousness of being thus contemplated pleased Mrs. Gould . "
26501	26505	26506	26506	I	0	" he said . "
26530	26531	26532	26532	They	1341	" "
26546	26628	26538	26538	They	1341	" Charles Gould interjected , in defence of the visitors ; and then his wife mentioned the name of the most considerable of the three . He was considerable in finance and in industry . His name was familiar to many millions of people . He was so considerable that he would never have travelled so far away from the centre of his activity if the doctors had not insisted , with veiled menaces , on his taking a long holiday . "
26636	26641	26629	26630	Mr. Holroyd	305	" Mrs. Gould pursued , "
26720	26721	26709	26709	He	305	" "
26727	26741	26709	26709	He	305	" said Mr. Gould , marvelling inwardly at the mobility of her physiognomy . "
26756	26757	26760	26760	he	305	" "
26765	26772	26760	26760	he	305	" Mrs. Gould declared , scrupulously . "
26811	26812	26813	26813	He	305	" "
26825	26830	26813	26813	He	305	" Charles Gould observed . "
26922	26923	26924	26925	A man	771	" "
26932	27001	26924	26925	A man	771	" Charles Gould said , vaguely . Mrs. Gould , frowning , surveyed him from head to foot . With his riding breeches , leather leggings an article of apparel never before seen in Costaguana , a Norfolk coat of grey flannel , and those great flaming moustaches , he suggested an officer of cavalry turned gentleman farmer . This combination was gratifying to Mrs. Gould 's tastes . "
27009	27013	27014	27014	He	1363	" she thought . "
27018	27057	27014	27014	He	1363	" But there was no denying that his fine - drawn , keen red face , and his whole , long - limbed , lank person had an air of breeding and distinction . And Mrs. Gould relented . "
27065	27122	27062	27062	you	1363	" she murmured , gently . During the last few days , as it happened , Charles Gould had been kept too busy thinking twice before he spoke to have paid much attention to the state of his feelings . But theirs was a successful match , and he had no difficulty in finding his answer . "
27136	27197	27130	27130	your	0	" he said , lightly ; and there was so much truth in that obscure phrase that he experienced towards her at the moment a great increase of gratitude and tenderness . Mrs. Gould , however , did not seem to find this answer in the least obscure . She brightened up delicately ; already he had changed his tone . "
27464	27498	27499	27499	He	1376	" They were walking up and down the corredor . Her head just reached to his shoulder . His arm , extended downwards , was about her waist . His spurs jingled slightly . "
27573	27610	27558	27558	They	1382	" His spurred feet clinked slowly . He was bending over his wife as they walked . The big parrot , turning its head askew , followed their pacing figures with a round , unblinking eye . "
27706	27808	27703	27703	he	1376	" Mrs. Gould shook her head negatively ; which was just what her husband had expected from the strength of the argument . But she shook her head negatively only because she thought that no one could know her Charles - really know him for what he was but herself . The thing was obvious . It could be felt . It required no argument . And poor Mr. Gould , senior , who had died too soon to ever hear of their engagement , remained too shadowy a figure for her to be credited with knowledge of any sort whatever . "
27847	28445	27836	27836	I	0	" Charles Gould pursued : and she pressed her head to his shoulder approvingly . These two young people remembered the life which had ended wretchedly just when their own lives had come together in that splendour of hopeful love , which to the most sensible minds appears like a triumph of good over all the evils of the earth . A vague idea of rehabilitation had entered the plan of their life . That it was so vague as to elude the support of argument made it only the stronger . It had presented itself to them at the instant when the woman 's instinct of devotion and the man 's instinct of activity receive from the strongest of illusions their most powerful impulse . The very prohibition imposed the necessity of success . It was as if they had been morally bound to make good their vigorous view of life against the unnatural error of weariness and despair . If the idea of wealth was present to them it was only in so far as it was bound with that other success . Mrs. Gould , an orphan from early childhood and without fortune , brought up in an atmosphere of intellectual interests , had never considered the aspects of great wealth . They were too remote , and she had not learned that they were desirable . On the other hand , she had not known anything of absolute want . Even the very poverty of her aunt , the Marchesa , had nothing intolerable to a refined mind ; it seemed in accord with a great grief : it had the austerity of a sacrifice offered to a noble ideal . Thus even the most legitimate touch of materialism was wanting in Mrs. Gould 's character . The dead man of whom she thought with tenderness because he was Charley 's father and with some impatience because he had been weak , must be put completely in the wrong . Nothing else would do to keep their prosperity without a stain on its only real , on its immaterial side ! Charles Gould , on his part , had been obliged to keep the idea of wealth well to the fore ; but he brought it forward as a means , not as an end . Unless the mine was good business it could not be touched . He had to insist on that aspect of the enterprise . It was his lever to move men who had capital . And Charles Gould believed in the mine . He knew everything that could be known of it . His faith in the mine was contagious , though it was not served by a great eloquence ; but business men are frequently as sanguine and imaginative as lovers . They are affected by a personality much oftener than people would suppose ; and Charles Gould , in his unshaken assurance , was absolutely convincing . Besides , it was a matter of common knowledge to the men to whom he addressed himself that mining in Costaguana was a game that could be made considerably more than worth the candle . The men of affairs knew that very well . The real difficulty in touching it was elsewhere . Against that there was an implication of calm and implacable resolution in Charles Gould 's very voice . Men of affairs venture sometimes on acts that the common judgment of the world would pronounce absurd ; they make their decisions on apparently impulsive and human grounds . "
28449	28474	27836	27836	I	0	" had said the considerable personage to whom Charles Gould on his way out through San Francisco had lucidly exposed his point of view . "
28648	28814	28601	28602	Mr. Gould	250	" Thus spoke the considerable personage , the millionaire endower of churches on a scale befitting the greatness of his native land - the same to whom the doctors used the language of horrid and veiled menaces . He was a big - limbed , deliberate man , whose quiet burliness lent to an ample silk - faced frock - coat a superfine dignity . His hair was iron grey , his eyebrows were still black , and his massive profile was the profile of a Caesar 's head on an old Roman coin . But his parentage was German and Scotch and English , with remote strains of Danish and French blood , giving him the temperament of a Puritan and an insatiable imagination of conquest . He was completely unbending to his visitor , because of the warm introduction the visitor had brought from Europe , and because of an irrational liking for earnestness and determination wherever met , to whatever end directed . "
29040	29419	29037	29037	I	0	" By this he meant to express his faith in destiny in words suitable to his intelligence , which was unskilled in the presentation of general ideas . His intelligence was nourished on facts ; and Charles Gould , whose imagination had been permanently affected by the one great fact of a silver mine , had no objection to this theory of the world 's future . If it had seemed distasteful for a moment it was because the sudden statement of such vast eventualities dwarfed almost to nothingness the actual matter in hand . He and his plans and all the mineral wealth of the Occidental Province appeared suddenly robbed of every vestige of magnitude . The sensation was disagreeable ; but Charles Gould was not dull . Already he felt that he was producing a favourable impression ; the consciousness of that flattering fact helped him to a vague smile , which his big interlocutor took for a smile of discreet and admiring assent . He smiled quietly , too ; and immediately Charles Gould , with that mental agility mankind will display in defence of a cherished hope , reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success . His personality and his mine would be taken up because it was a matter of no great consequence , one way or another , to a man who referred his action to such a prodigious destiny . And Charles Gould was not humiliated by this consideration , because the thing remained as big as ever for him . Nobody else 's vast conceptions of destiny could diminish the aspect of his desire for the redemption of the San Tome mine . In comparison to the correctness of his aim , definite in space and absolutely attainable within a limited time , the other man appeared for an instant as a dreamy idealist of no importance . The great man , massive and benignant , had been looking at him thoughtfully ; when he broke the short silence it was to remark that concessions flew about thick in the air of Costaguana . Any simple soul that just yearned to be taken in could bring down a concession at the first shot . "
29429	29451	29420	29421	Our consuls	1409	" he continued , with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes . But in a moment he became grave . "
29617	29661	29609	29609	you	250	" He bent forward to look steadily into the unflinching eyes of Charles Gould , who , remembering the large box full of his father 's letters , put the accumulated scorn and bitterness of many years into the tone of his answer - "
29713	29714	29733	29733	you	250	" "
29864	29988	29989	29991	This young fellow	1425	" Thus the great personage had spoken then , in his own private office , in a great city where other men very considerable in the eyes of a vain populace waited with alacrity upon a wave of his hand . And rather more than a year later , during his unexpected appearance in Sulaco , he had emphasized his uncompromising attitude with a freedom of sincerity permitted to his wealth and influence . He did this with the less reserve , perhaps , because the inspection of what had been done , and more still the way in which successive steps had been taken , had impressed him with the conviction that Charles Gould was perfectly capable of keeping up his end . "
29993	29999	29989	29991	This young fellow	1425	" he thought to himself , "
30009	30032	30033	30033	My	0	" This thought flattered him , for hitherto the only account of this young man he could give to his intimates was - "
30145	30197	30139	30140	your Costaguana	1439	" Of course , he was too great a man to be questioned as to his motives , even by his intimates . The outside world was at liberty to wonder respectfully at the hidden meaning of his actions . He was so great a man that his lavish patronage of the "
30202	30733	30734	30734	You	1440	" which in its naive form of church - building amused Mrs. Gould was looked upon by his fellow - citizens as the manifestation of a pious and humble spirit . But in his own circles of the financial world the taking up of such a thing as the San Tome mine was regarded with respect , indeed , but rather as a subject for discreet jocularity . It was a great man 's caprice . In the great Holroyd building an enormous pile of iron , glass , and blocks of stone at the corner of two streets , cobwebbed aloft by the radiation of telegraph wires the heads of principal departments exchanged humorous glances , which meant that they were not let into the secrets of the San Tome business . The Costaguana mail it was never large - one fairly heavy envelope was taken unopened straight into the great man 's room , and no instructions dealing with it had ever been issued thence . The office whispered that he answered personally - and not by dictation either , but actually writing in his own hand , with pen and ink , and , it was to be supposed , taking a copy in his own private press copy - book , inaccessible to profane eyes . Some scornful young men , insignificant pieces of minor machinery in that eleven - storey - high workshop of great affairs , expressed frankly their private opinion that the great chief had done at last something silly , and was ashamed of his folly ; others , elderly and insignificant , but full of romantic reverence for the business that had devoured their best years , used to mutter darkly and knowingly that this was a portentous sign ; that the Holroyd connection meant by - and - by to get hold of the whole Republic of Costaguana , lock , stock , and barrel . But , in fact , the hobby theory was the right one . It interested the great man to attend personally to the San Tome mine ; it interested him so much that he allowed this hobby to give a direction to the first complete holiday he had taken for quite a startling number of years . He was not running a great enterprise there ; no mere railway board or industrial corporation . He was running a man ! A success would have pleased him very much on refreshingly novel grounds ; but , on the other side of the same feeling , it was incumbent upon him to cast it off utterly at the first sign of failure . A man may be thrown off . The papers had unfortunately trumpeted all over the land his journey to Costaguana . If he was pleased at the way Charles Gould was going on , he infused an added grimness into his assurances of support . Even at the very last interview , half an hour or so before he rolled out of the patio , hat in hand , behind Mrs. Gould 's white mules , he had said in Charles 's room - "
30778	30789	30790	30790	You	1440	" To this Charles Gould 's only answer had been : "
30803	30872	30790	30790	You	1440	" And the great man had liked this imperturbable assurance . The secret of it was that to Charles Gould 's mind these uncompromising terms were agreeable . Like this the mine preserved its identity , with which he had endowed it as a boy ; and it remained dependent on himself alone . It was a serious affair , and he , too , took it grimly . "
30876	30912	30790	30790	You	1440	" he said to his wife , alluding to this last conversation with the departed guest , while they walked slowly up and down the corredor , followed by the irritated eye of the parrot - "
30985	31017	31018	31019	Viva Costaguana	328	" They had stopped near the cage . The parrot , catching the sound of a word belonging to his vocabulary , was moved to interfere . Parrots are very human . "
31021	31052	31018	31019	Viva Costaguana	328	" he shrieked , with intense self - assertion , and , instantly ruffling up his feathers , assumed an air of puffed - up somnolence behind the glittering wires . "
31061	31066	31055	31055	you	1445	" Mrs. Gould asked . "
31077	31078	31055	31055	you	1445	" "
31088	31098	31055	31055	you	1445	" interrupted her husband , in a reasonable tone . "
31175	31176	31166	31166	Avellanos	247	" "
31184	31225	31166	31166	Avellanos	247	" protested Mrs. Gould , almost shocked . The allusion was not to the point . Don Jose was a dear good man , who talked very well , and was enthusiastic about the greatness of the San Tome mine . "
31234	31240	31228	31228	you	0	" she exclaimed , reproachfully . "
31250	31329	31247	31247	he	0	" The working competence of men - which she never questioned - was very surprising to Mrs. Gould , because upon so many obvious issues they showed themselves strangely muddle - headed . Charles Gould , with a careworn calmness which secured for him at once his wife 's anxious sympathy , assured her that he was not comparing . He was an American himself , after all , and perhaps he could understand both kinds of eloquence - "
31338	31407	31408	31408	God	259	" he added , grimly . But he had breathed the air of England longer than any of his people had done for three generations , and really he begged to be excused . His poor father could be eloquent , too . And he asked his wife whether she remembered a passage in one of his father 's last letters where Mr. Gould had expressed the conviction that "
31447	31454	31455	31455	You	1451	" Mrs. Gould had not forgotten . "
31463	31467	31455	31455	You	1451	" she murmured . "
31485	31486	31487	31487	He	1452	" "
31499	31504	31497	31497	him	1452	" said Charles Gould . "
31621	31636	31616	31616	your	250	" His arm pressed her slight form closer to his side for a moment . "
31666	31693	31694	31694	Charley	250	" She glanced up at him with admiration . He was competent ; he had given a vast shape to the vagueness of her unselfish ambitions . "
31696	31700	31694	31694	Charley	250	" she said , "
31706	31797	31701	31701	you	250	" He left her suddenly in the corredor to go and get his hat , a soft , grey sombrero , an article of national costume which combined unexpectedly well with his English get - up . He came back , a riding - whip under his arm , buttoning up a dogskin glove ; his face reflected the resolute nature of his thoughts . His wife had waited for him at the head of the stairs , and before he gave her the parting kiss he finished the conversation - "
31806	31810	31701	31701	you	250	" he said , "
31840	32024	31828	31828	We	1458	" He bent over her upturned face very tenderly and a little remorsefully . Charles Gould was competent because he had no illusions . The Gould Concession had to fight for life with such weapons as could be found at once in the mire of a corruption that was so universal as almost to lose its significance . He was prepared to stoop for his weapons . For a moment he felt as if the silver mine , which had killed his father , had decoyed him further than he meant to go ; and with the roundabout logic of emotions , he felt that the worthiness of his life was bound up with success . There was no going back . CHAPTER SEVEN Mrs. Gould was too intelligently sympathetic not to share that feeling . It made life exciting , and she was too much of a woman not to like excitement . But it frightened her , too , a little ; and when Don Jose Avellanos , rocking in the American chair , would go so far as to say , "
32062	32140	32145	32145	Emilia	307	" Mrs. Gould would look up from the tea - table profoundly at her unmoved husband stirring the spoon in the cup as though he had not heard a word . Not that Don Jose anticipated anything of the sort . He could not praise enough dear Carlos 's tact and courage . His English , rock - like quality of character was his best safeguard , Don Jose affirmed ; and , turning to Mrs. Gould , "
32149	32165	32145	32145	Emilia	307	" - he would address her with the familiarity of his age and old friendship - "
32182	33037	32174	32174	you	298	" This might have been less or more than the truth . Mrs. Gould , accompanying her husband all over the province in the search for labour , had seen the land with a deeper glance than a trueborn Costaguanera could have done . In her travel - worn riding habit , her face powdered white like a plaster cast , with a further protection of a small silk mask during the heat of the day , she rode on a well - shaped , light - footed pony in the centre of a little cavalcade . Two mozos de campo , picturesque in great hats , with spurred bare heels , in white embroidered calzoneras , leather jackets and striped ponchos , rode ahead with carbines across their shoulders , swaying in unison to the pace of the horses . A tropilla of pack mules brought up the rear in charge of a thin brown muleteer , sitting his long - eared beast very near the tail , legs thrust far forward , the wide brim of his hat set far back , making a sort of halo for his head . An old Costaguana officer , a retired senior major of humble origin , but patronized by the first families on account of his Blanco opinions , had been recommended by Don Jose for commissary and organizer of that expedition . The points of his grey moustache hung far below his chin , and , riding on Mrs. Gould 's left hand , he looked about with kindly eyes , pointing out the features of the country , telling the names of the little pueblos and of the estates , of the smooth - walled haciendas like long fortresses crowning the knolls above the level of the Sulaco Valley . It unrolled itself , with green young crops , plains , woodland , and gleams of water , park - like , from the blue vapour of the distant sierra to an immense quivering horizon of grass and sky , where big white clouds seemed to fall slowly into the darkness of their own shadows . Men ploughed with wooden ploughs and yoked oxen , small on a boundless expanse , as if attacking immensity itself . The mounted figures of vaqueros galloped in the distance , and the great herds fed with all their horned heads one way , in one single wavering line as far as eye could reach across the broad potreros . A spreading cotton - wool tree shaded a thatched ranche by the road ; the trudging files of burdened Indians taking off their hats , would lift sad , mute eyes to the cavalcade raising the dust of the crumbling camino real made by the hands of their enslaved forefathers . And Mrs. Gould , with each day 's journey , seemed to come nearer to the soul of the land in the tremendous disclosure of this interior unaffected by the slight European veneer of the coast towns , a great land of plain and mountain and people , suffering and mute , waiting for the future in a pathetic immobility of patience . She knew its sights and its hospitality , dispensed with a sort of slumbrous dignity in those great houses presenting long , blind walls and heavy portals to the wind - swept pastures . She was given the head of the tables , where masters and dependants sat in a simple and patriarchal state . The ladies of the house would talk softly in the moonlight under the orange trees of the courtyards , impressing upon her the sweetness of their voices and the something mysterious in the quietude of their lives . In the morning the gentlemen , well mounted in braided sombreros and embroidered riding suits , with much silver on the trappings of their horses , would ride forth to escort the departing guests before committing them , with grave good - byes , to the care of God at the boundary pillars of their estates . In all these households she could hear stories of political outrage ; friends , relatives , ruined , imprisoned , killed in the battles of senseless civil wars , barbarously executed in ferocious proscriptions , as though the government of the country had been a struggle of lust between bands of absurd devils let loose upon the land with sabres and uniforms and grandiloquent phrases . And on all the lips she found a weary desire for peace , the dread of officialdom with its nightmarish parody of administration without law , without security , and without justice . She bore a whole two months of wandering very well ; she had that power of resistance to fatigue which one discovers here and there in some quite frail - looking women with surprise - like a state of possession by a remarkably stubborn spirit . Don Pepe - the old Costaguana major - after much display of solicitude for the delicate lady , had ended by conferring upon her the name of the "
33043	33309	32174	32174	you	298	" Mrs. Gould was indeed becoming a Costaguanera . Having acquired in Southern Europe a knowledge of true peasantry , she was able to appreciate the great worth of the people . She saw the man under the silent , sad - eyed beast of burden . She saw them on the road carrying loads , lonely figures upon the plain , toiling under great straw hats , with their white clothing flapping about their limbs in the wind ; she remembered the villages by some group of Indian women at the fountain impressed upon her memory , by the face of some young Indian girl with a melancholy and sensual profile , raising an earthenware vessel of cool water at the door of a dark hut with a wooden porch cumbered with great brown jars . The solid wooden wheels of an ox - cart , halted with its shafts in the dust , showed the strokes of the axe ; and a party of charcoal carriers , with each man 's load resting above his head on the top of the low mud wall , slept stretched in a row within the strip of shade . The heavy stonework of bridges and churches left by the conquerors proclaimed the disregard of human labour , the tribute - labour of vanished nations . The power of king and church was gone , but at the sight of some heavy ruinous pile overtopping from a knoll the low mud walls of a village , Don Pepe would interrupt the tale of his campaigns to exclaim - "
33346	33654	33344	33344	thieves	5681	" Charles talked with the alcaldes , with the fiscales , with the principal people in towns , and with the caballeros on the estates . The commandantes of the districts offered him escorts - for he could show an authorization from the Sulaco political chief of the day . How much the document had cost him in gold twenty - dollar pieces was a secret between himself , a great man in the United States who condescended to answer the Sulaco mail with his own hand , and a great man of another sort , with a dark olive complexion and shifty eyes , inhabiting then the Palace of the Intendencia in Sulaco , and who piqued himself on his culture and Europeanism generally in a rather French style because he had lived in Europe for some years - in exile , he said . However , it was pretty well known that just before this exile he had incautiously gambled away all the cash in the Custom House of a small port where a friend in power had procured for him the post of subcollector . That youthful indiscretion had , amongst other inconveniences , obliged him to earn his living for a time as a cafe waiter in Madrid ; but his talents must have been great , after all , since they had enabled him to retrieve his political fortunes so splendidly . Charles Gould , exposing his business with an imperturbable steadiness , called him Excellency . The provincial Excellency assumed a weary superiority , tilting his chair far back near an open window in the true Costaguana manner . The military band happened to be braying operatic selections on the plaza just then , and twice he raised his hand imperatively for silence in order to listen to a favourite passage . "
33659	33674	33675	33675	Lucia	335	" he murmured ; while Charles Gould waited , standing by with inscrutable patience . "
33714	33794	33710	33710	you	0	" Of course , rumours had reached him already of the newcomer 's intentions . Besides , he had received an official warning from Sta . Marta . His manner was intended simply to conceal his curiosity and impress his visitor . But after he had locked up something valuable in the drawer of a large writing - desk in a distant part of the room , he became very affable , and walked back to his chair smartly . "
33823	33833	33834	33834	I	0	" he suggested in a business - like manner . "
33841	33848	33834	33834	I	0	" said Charles Gould , steadily , "
33861	33894	33850	33850	I	0	" The Excellency was a man of many moods . With the receipt of the money a great mellowness had descended upon his simple soul . Unexpectedly he fetched a deep sigh . "
33945	34043	33933	33933	I	0	" With one hand thrust into his swelling bosom , he rose and fell on his toes , and for ten minutes , almost without drawing breath , went on hurling himself intellectually to the assault of Charles Gould 's polite silence ; and when , stopping abruptly , he fell back into his chair , it was as though he had been beaten off from a fortress . To save his dignity he hastened to dismiss this silent man with a solemn inclination of the head and the words , pronounced with moody , fatigued condescension - "
34063	34408	34409	34411	King of Sulaco	1476	" He took up a paper fan and began to cool himself with a consequential air , while Charles Gould bowed and withdrew . Then he dropped the fan at once , and stared with an appearance of wonder and perplexity at the closed door for quite a long time . At last he shrugged his shoulders as if to assure himself of his disdain . Cold , dull . No intellectuality . Red hair . A true Englishman . He despised him . His face darkened . What meant this unimpressed and frigid behaviour ? He was the first of the successive politicians sent out from the capital to rule the Occidental Province whom the manner of Charles Gould in official intercourse was to strike as offensively independent . Charles Gould assumed that if the appearance of listening to deplorable balderdash must form part of the price he had to pay for being left unmolested , the obligation of uttering balderdash personally was by no means included in the bargain . He drew the line there . To these provincial autocrats , before whom the peaceable population of all classes had been accustomed to tremble , the reserve of that English - looking engineer caused an uneasiness which swung to and fro between cringing and truculence . Gradually all of them discovered that , no matter what party was in power , that man remained in most effective touch with the higher authorities in Sta . Marta . This was a fact , and it accounted perfectly for the Goulds being by no means so wealthy as the engineer - in - chief on the new railway could legitimately suppose . Following the advice of Don Jose Avellanos , who was a man of good counsel though rendered timid by his horrible experiences of Guzman Bento 's time , Charles Gould had kept clear of the capital ; but in the current gossip of the foreign residents there he was known with a good deal of seriousness underlying the irony by the nickname of "
34413	34467	34409	34411	King of Sulaco	1476	" An advocate of the Costaguana Bar , a man of reputed ability and good character , member of the distinguished Moraga family possessing extensive estates in the Sulaco Valley , was pointed out to strangers , with a shade of mystery and respect , as the agent of the San Tome mine - "
34473	35425	35426	35426	He	1478	" He was tall , black - whiskered , and discreet . It was known that he had easy access to ministers , and that the numerous Costaguana generals were always anxious to dine at his house . Presidents granted him audience with facility . He corresponded actively with his maternal uncle , Don Jose Avellanos ; but his letters - unless those expressing formally his dutiful affection - were seldom entrusted to the Costaguana Post Office . There the envelopes are opened , indiscriminately , with the frankness of a brazen and childish impudence characteristic of some Spanish - American Governments . But it must be noted that at about the time of the re - opening of the San Tome mine the muleteer who had been employed by Charles Gould in his preliminary travels on the Campo added his small train of animals to the thin stream of traffic carried over the mountain passes between the Sta . Marta upland and the Valley of Sulaco . There are no travellers by that arduous and unsafe route unless under very exceptional circumstances , and the state of inland trade did not visibly require additional transport facilities ; but the man seemed to find his account in it . A few packages were always found for him whenever he took the road . Very brown and wooden , in goatskin breeches with the hair outside , he sat near the tail of his own smart mule , his great hat turned against the sun , an expression of blissful vacancy on his long face , humming day after day a love - song in a plaintive key , or , without a change of expression , letting out a yell at his small tropilla in front . A round little guitar hung high up on his back ; and there was a place scooped out artistically in the wood of one of his pack - saddles where a tightly rolled piece of paper could be slipped in , the wooden plug replaced , and the coarse canvas nailed on again . When in Sulaco it was his practice to smoke and doze all day long as though he had no care in the world on a stone bench outside the doorway of the Casa Gould and facing the windows of the Avellanos house . Years and years ago his mother had been chief laundry - woman in that family - very accomplished in the matter of clear - starching . He himself had been born on one of their haciendas . His name was Bonifacio , and Don Jose , crossing the street about five o'clock to call on Dona Emilia , always acknowledged his humble salute by some movement of hand or head . The porters of both houses conversed lazily with him in tones of grave intimacy . His evenings he devoted to gambling and to calls in a spirit of generous festivity upon the peyne d'oro girls in the more remote side - streets of the town . But he , too , was a discreet man . CHAPTER EIGHT Those of us whom business or curiosity took to Sulaco in these years before the first advent of the railway can remember the steadying effect of the San Tome mine upon the life of that remote province . The outward appearances had not changed then as they have changed since , as I am told , with cable cars running along the streets of the Constitution , and carriage roads far into the country , to Rincon and other villages , where the foreign merchants and the Ricos generally have their modern villas , and a vast railway goods yard by the harbour , which has a quay - side , a long range of warehouses , and quite serious , organized labour troubles of its own . Nobody had ever heard of labour troubles then . The Cargadores of the port formed , indeed , an unruly brotherhood of all sorts of scum , with a patron saint of their own . They went on strike regularly every bull - fight day , a form of trouble that even Nostromo at the height of his prestige could never cope with efficiently ; but the morning after each fiesta , before the Indian market - women had opened their mat parasols on the plaza , when the snows of Higuerota gleamed pale over the town on a yet black sky , the appearance of a phantom - like horseman mounted on a silver - grey mare solved the problem of labour without fail . His steed paced the lanes of the slums and the weed - grown enclosures within the old ramparts , between the black , lightless cluster of huts , like cow - byres , like dog - kennels . The horseman hammered with the butt of a heavy revolver at the doors of low pulperias , of obscene lean - to sheds sloping against the tumble - down piece of a noble wall , at the wooden sides of dwellings so flimsy that the sound of snores and sleepy mutters within could be heard in the pauses of the thundering clatter of his blows . He called out men 's names menacingly from the saddle , once , twice . The drowsy answers - grumpy , conciliating , savage , jocular , or deprecating - came out into the silent darkness in which the horseman sat still , and presently a dark figure would flit out coughing in the still air . Sometimes a low - toned woman cried through the window - hole softly , "
35433	35887	35426	35426	He	1478	" and the horseman waited silent on a motionless horse . But if perchance he had to dismount , then , after a while , from the door of that hovel or of that pulperia , with a ferocious scuffle and stifled imprecations , a cargador would fly out head first and hands abroad , to sprawl under the forelegs of the silver - grey mare , who only pricked forward her sharp little ears . She was used to that work ; and the man , picking himself up , would walk away hastily from Nostromo 's revolver , reeling a little along the street and snarling low curses . At sunrise Captain Mitchell , coming out anxiously in his night attire on to the wooden balcony running the whole length of the O.S.N. Company 's lonely building by the shore , would see the lighters already under way , figures moving busily about the cargo cranes , perhaps hear the invaluable Nostromo , now dismounted and in the checked shirt and red sash of a Mediterranean sailor , bawling orders from the end of the jetty in a stentorian voice . A fellow in a thousand ! The material apparatus of perfected civilization which obliterates the individuality of old towns under the stereotyped conveniences of modern life had not intruded as yet ; but over the worn - out antiquity of Sulaco , so characteristic with its stuccoed houses and barred windows , with the great yellowy - white walls of abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses , that fact - very modern in its spirit - the San Tome mine had already thrown its subtle influence . It had altered , too , the outward character of the crowds on feast days on the plaza before the open portal of the cathedral , by the number of white ponchos with a green stripe affected as holiday wear by the San Tome miners . They had also adopted white hats with green cord and braid - articles of good quality , which could be obtained in the storehouse of the administration for very little money . A peaceable Cholo wearing these colours unusual in Costaguana was somehow very seldom beaten to within an inch of his life on a charge of disrespect to the town police ; neither ran he much risk of being suddenly lassoed on the road by a recruiting party of lanceros - a method of voluntary enlistment looked upon as almost legal in the Republic . Whole villages were known to have volunteered for the army in that way ; but , as Don Pepe would say with a hopeless shrug to Mrs. Gould , "
35907	35957	35904	35905	its soldiers	1483	" Thus professionally spoke Don Pepe , the fighter , with pendent moustaches , a nut - brown , lean face , and a clean run of a cast - iron jaw , suggesting the type of a cattle - herd horseman from the great Llanos of the South . "
35971	36364	35963	35969	an old officer of Paez , senores	1485	" was the exordium of all his speeches in the Aristocratic Club of Sulaco , where he was admitted on account of his past services to the extinct cause of Federation . The club , dating from the days of the proclamation of Costaguana 's independence , boasted many names of liberators amongst its first founders . Suppressed arbitrarily innumerable times by various Governments , with memories of proscriptions and of at least one wholesale massacre of its members , sadly assembled for a banquet by the order of a zealous military commandante their bodies were afterwards stripped naked and flung into the plaza out of the windows by the lowest scum of the populace , it was again flourishing , at that period , peacefully . It extended to strangers the large hospitality of the cool , big rooms of its historic quarters in the front part of a house , once the residence of a high official of the Holy Office . The two wings , shut up , crumbled behind the nailed doors , and what may be described as a grove of young orange trees grown in the unpaved patio concealed the utter ruin of the back part facing the gate . You turned in from the street , as if entering a secluded orchard , where you came upon the foot of a disjointed staircase , guarded by a moss - stained effigy of some saintly bishop , mitred and staffed , and bearing the indignity of a broken nose meekly , with his fine stone hands crossed on his breast . The chocolate - coloured faces of servants with mops of black hair peeped at you from above ; the click of billiard balls came to your ears , and ascending the steps , you would perhaps see in the first sala , very stiff upon a straight - backed chair , in a good light , Don Pepe moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way , at arm 's length , through an old Sta . Marta newspaper . His horse - a stony - hearted but persevering black brute with a hammer head - you would have seen in the street dozing motionless under an immense saddle , with its nose almost touching the curbstone of the sidewalk . Don Pepe , when "
36370	36569	35963	35969	an old officer of Paez , senores	1485	" as the phrase , often heard in Sulaco , went , could also be seen in the drawing - room of the Casa Gould . He sat with modest assurance at some distance from the tea - table . With his knees close together , and a kindly twinkle of drollery in his deep - set eyes , he would throw his small and ironic pleasantries into the current of conversation . There was in that man a sort of sane , humorous shrewdness , and a vein of genuine humanity so often found in simple old soldiers of proved courage who have seen much desperate service . Of course he knew nothing whatever of mining , but his employment was of a special kind . He was in charge of the whole population in the territory of the mine , which extended from the head of the gorge to where the cart track from the foot of the mountain enters the plain , crossing a stream over a little wooden bridge painted green - green , the colour of hope , being also the colour of the mine . It was reported in Sulaco that up there "
36573	36668	35963	35969	an old officer of Paez , senores	1485	" Don Pepe walked about precipitous paths , girt with a great sword and in a shabby uniform with tarnished bullion epaulettes of a senior major . Most miners being Indians , with big wild eyes , addressed him as Taita father , as these barefooted people of Costaguana will address anybody who wears shoes ; but it was Basilio , Mr. Gould 's own mozo and the head servant of the Casa , who , in all good faith and from a sense of propriety , announced him once in the solemn words , "
36675	36734	36669	36671	El Senor Gobernador	340	" Don Jose Avellanos , then in the drawing - room , was delighted beyond measure at the aptness of the title , with which he greeted the old major banteringly as soon as the latter 's soldierly figure appeared in the doorway . Don Pepe only smiled in his long moustaches , as much as to say , "
36747	36778	36735	36735	You	1487	" And El Senor Gobernador he had remained , with his small jokes upon his function and upon his domain , where he affirmed with humorous exaggeration to Mrs. Gould - "
36795	37367	36793	36793	senora	1489	" And he would tap his ear with the tip of his forefinger knowingly . Even when the number of the miners alone rose to over six hundred he seemed to know each of them individually , all the innumerable Joses , Manuels , Ignacios , from the villages primero - segundo - or tercero there were three mining villages under his government . He could distinguish them not only by their flat , joyless faces , which to Mrs. Gould looked all alike , as if run into the same ancestral mould of suffering and patience , but apparently also by the infinitely graduated shades of reddish - brown , of blackish - brown , of coppery - brown backs , as the two shifts , stripped to linen drawers and leather skull - caps , mingled together with a confusion of naked limbs , of shouldered picks , swinging lamps , in a great shuffle of sandalled feet on the open plateau before the entrance of the main tunnel . It was a time of pause . The Indian boys leaned idly against the long line of little cradle wagons standing empty ; the screeners and ore - breakers squatted on their heels smoking long cigars ; the great wooden shoots slanting over the edge of the tunnel plateau were silent ; and only the ceaseless , violent rush of water in the open flumes could be heard , murmuring fiercely , with the splash and rumble of revolving turbine - wheels , and the thudding march of the stamps pounding to powder the treasure rock on the plateau below . The heads of gangs , distinguished by brass medals hanging on their bare breasts , marshalled their squads ; and at last the mountain would swallow one - half of the silent crowd , while the other half would move off in long files down the zigzag paths leading to the bottom of the gorge . It was deep ; and , far below , a thread of vegetation winding between the blazing rock faces resembled a slender green cord , in which three lumpy knots of banana patches , palm - leaf roots , and shady trees marked the Village One , Village Two , Village Three , housing the miners of the Gould Concession . Whole families had been moving from the first towards the spot in the Higuerota range , whence the rumour of work and safety had spread over the pastoral Campo , forcing its way also , even as the waters of a high flood , into the nooks and crannies of the distant blue walls of the Sierras . Father first , in a pointed straw hat , then the mother with the bigger children , generally also a diminutive donkey , all under burdens , except the leader himself , or perhaps some grown girl , the pride of the family , stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow , with braids of raven hair , a thick , haughty profile , and no load to carry but the small guitar of the country and a pair of soft leather sandals tied together on her back . At the sight of such parties strung out on the cross trails between the pastures , or camped by the side of the royal road , travellers on horseback would remark to each other - "
37385	37549	37380	37380	others	5859	" And spurring on in the dusk they would discuss the great news of the province , the news of the San Tome mine . A rich Englishman was going to work it - and perhaps not an Englishman , Quien sabe ! A foreigner with much money . Oh , yes , it had begun . A party of men who had been to Sulaco with a herd of black bulls for the next corrida had reported that from the porch of the posada in Rincon , only a short league from the town , the lights on the mountain were visible , twinkling above the trees . And there was a woman seen riding a horse sideways , not in the chair seat , but upon a sort of saddle , and a man 's hat on her head . She walked about , too , on foot up the mountain paths . A woman engineer , it seemed she was . "
37558	37559	37556	37556	senor	1479	" "
37569	37570	37564	37567	Una Americana del Norte	344	" "
37592	38159	37581	37582	Una Americana	344	" And they would laugh a little with astonishment and scorn , keeping a wary eye on the shadows of the road , for one is liable to meet bad men when travelling late on the Campo . And it was not only the men that Don Pepe knew so well , but he seemed able , with one attentive , thoughtful glance , to classify each woman , girl , or growing youth of his domain . It was only the small fry that puzzled him sometimes . He and the padre could be seen frequently side by side , meditative and gazing across the street of a village at a lot of sedate brown children , trying to sort them out , as it were , in low , consulting tones , or else they would together put searching questions as to the parentage of some small , staid urchin met wandering , naked and grave , along the road with a cigar in his baby mouth , and perhaps his mother 's rosary , purloined for purposes of ornamentation , hanging in a loop of beads low down on his rotund little stomach . The spiritual and temporal pastors of the mine flock were very good friends . With Dr. Monygham , the medical pastor , who had accepted the charge from Mrs. Gould , and lived in the hospital building , they were on not so intimate terms . But no one could be on intimate terms with El Senor Doctor , who , with his twisted shoulders , drooping head , sardonic mouth , and side - long bitter glance , was mysterious and uncanny . The other two authorities worked in harmony . Father Roman , dried - up , small , alert , wrinkled , with big round eyes , a sharp chin , and a great snuff - taker , was an old campaigner , too ; he had shriven many simple souls on the battlefields of the Republic , kneeling by the dying on hillsides , in the long grass , in the gloom of the forests , to hear the last confession with the smell of gunpowder smoke in his nostrils , the rattle of muskets , the hum and spatter of bullets in his ears . And where was the harm if , at the presbytery , they had a game with a pack of greasy cards in the early evening , before Don Pepe went his last rounds to see that all the watchmen of the mine - a body organized by himself - were at their posts ? For that last duty before he slept Don Pepe did actually gird his old sword on the verandah of an unmistakable American white frame house , which Father Roman called the presbytery . Near by , a long , low , dark building , steeple - roofed , like a vast barn with a wooden cross over the gable , was the miners ' chapel . There Father Roman said Mass every day before a sombre altar - piece representing the Resurrection , the grey slab of the tombstone balanced on one corner , a figure soaring upwards , long - limbed and livid , in an oval of pallid light , and a helmeted brown legionary smitten down , right across the bituminous foreground . "
38171	38182	38167	38169	linda e maravillosa	284	" Father Roman would say to some of his flock , "
38218	38268	38167	38169	linda e maravillosa	284	" And he would take a pinch of snuff with unction . But when once an inquisitive spirit desired to know in what direction this Europe was situated , whether up or down the coast , Father Roman , to conceal his perplexity , became very reserved and severe . "
38313	38316	38329	38330	Don Pepe	332	" With a "
38323	38324	38321	38321	Padre	348	" "
38332	38896	38329	38330	Don Pepe	332	" the Gobernador would go off , holding up his sabre against his side , his body bent forward , with a long , plodding stride in the dark . The jocularity proper to an innocent card game for a few cigars or a bundle of yerba was replaced at once by the stern duty mood of an officer setting out to visit the outposts of an encamped army . One loud blast of the whistle that hung from his neck provoked instantly a great shrilling of responding whistles , mingled with the barking of dogs , that would calm down slowly at last , away up at the head of the gorge ; and in the stillness two serenos , on guard by the bridge , would appear walking noiselessly towards him . On one side of the road a long frame building - the store - would be closed and barricaded from end to end ; facing it another white frame house , still longer , and with a verandah - the hospital - would have lights in the two windows of Dr. Monygham 's quarters . Even the delicate foliage of a clump of pepper trees did not stir , so breathless would be the darkness warmed by the radiation of the over - heated rocks . Don Pepe would stand still for a moment with the two motionless serenos before him , and , abruptly , high up on the sheer face of the mountain , dotted with single torches , like drops of fire fallen from the two great blazing clusters of lights above , the ore shoots would begin to rattle . The great clattering , shuffling noise , gathering speed and weight , would be caught up by the walls of the gorge , and sent upon the plain in a growl of thunder . The pasadero in Rincon swore that on calm nights , by listening intently , he could catch the sound in his doorway as of a storm in the mountains . To Charles Gould 's fancy it seemed that the sound must reach the uttermost limits of the province . Riding at night towards the mine , it would meet him at the edge of a little wood just beyond Rincon . There was no mistaking the growling mutter of the mountain pouring its stream of treasure under the stamps ; and it came to his heart with the peculiar force of a proclamation thundered forth over the land and the marvellousness of an accomplished fact fulfilling an audacious desire . He had heard this very sound in his imagination on that far - off evening when his wife and himself , after a tortuous ride through a strip of forest , had reined in their horses near the stream , and had gazed for the first time upon the jungle - grown solitude of the gorge . The head of a palm rose here and there . In a high ravine round the corner of the San Tome mountain which is square like a blockhouse the thread of a slender waterfall flashed bright and glassy through the dark green of the heavy fronds of tree - ferns . Don Pepe , in attendance , rode up , and , stretching his arm up the gorge , had declared with mock solemnity , "
38906	39029	38329	38330	Don Pepe	332	" And then they had wheeled their horses and ridden back to sleep that night at Rincon . The alcalde - an old , skinny Moreno , a sergeant of Guzman Bento 's time - had cleared respectfully out of his house with his three pretty daughters , to make room for the foreign senora and their worships the Caballeros . All he asked Charles Gould whom he took for a mysterious and official person to do for him was to remind the supreme Government - El Gobierno supreme - of a pension amounting to about a dollar a month to which he believed himself entitled . It had been promised to him , he affirmed , straightening his bent back martially , "
39051	39323	39045	39047	a young man	1507	" The waterfall existed no longer . The tree - ferns that had luxuriated in its spray had died around the dried - up pool , and the high ravine was only a big trench half filled up with the refuse of excavations and tailings . The torrent , dammed up above , sent its water rushing along the open flumes of scooped tree trunks striding on trestle - legs to the turbines working the stamps on the lower plateau - the mesa grande of the San Tome mountain . Only the memory of the waterfall , with its amazing fernery , like a hanging garden above the rocks of the gorge , was preserved in Mrs. Gould 's water - colour sketch ; she had made it hastily one day from a cleared patch in the bushes , sitting in the shade of a roof of straw erected for her on three rough poles under Don Pepe 's direction . Mrs. Gould had seen it all from the beginning : the clearing of the wilderness , the making of the road , the cutting of new paths up the cliff face of San Tome . For weeks together she had lived on the spot with her husband ; and she was so little in Sulaco during that year that the appearance of the Gould carriage on the Alameda would cause a social excitement . From the heavy family coaches full of stately senoras and black - eyed senoritas rolling solemnly in the shaded alley white hands were waved towards her with animation in a flutter of greetings . Dona Emilia was "
39329	39340	39045	39047	a young man	1507	" But not for long . Dona Emilia would be gone "
39345	39638	39045	39047	a young man	1507	" in a day or two , and her sleek carriage mules would have an easy time of it for another long spell . She had watched the erection of the first frame - house put up on the lower mesa for an office and Don Pepe 's quarters ; she heard with a thrill of thankful emotion the first wagon load of ore rattle down the then only shoot ; she had stood by her husband 's side perfectly silent , and gone cold all over with excitement at the instant when the first battery of only fifteen stamps was put in motion for the first time . On the occasion when the fires under the first set of retorts in their shed had glowed far into the night she did not retire to rest on the rough cadre set up for her in the as yet bare frame - house till she had seen the first spongy lump of silver yielded to the hazards of the world by the dark depths of the Gould Concession ; she had laid her unmercenary hands , with an eagerness that made them tremble , upon the first silver ingot turned out still warm from the mould ; and by her imaginative estimate of its power she endowed that lump of metal with a justificative conception , as though it were not a mere fact , but something far - reaching and impalpable , like the true expression of an emotion or the emergence of a principle . Don Pepe , extremely interested , too , looked over her shoulder with a smile that , making longitudinal folds on his face , caused it to resemble a leathern mask with a benignantly diabolic expression . "
39668	40371	39657	39658	por Dios	350	" he remarked , jocularly . Hernandez , the robber , had been an inoffensive , small ranchero , kidnapped with circumstances of peculiar atrocity from his home during one of the civil wars , and forced to serve in the army . There his conduct as soldier was exemplary , till , watching his chance , he killed his colonel , and managed to get clear away . With a band of deserters , who chose him for their chief , he had taken refuge beyond the wild and waterless Bolson de Tonoro . The haciendas paid him blackmail in cattle and horses ; extraordinary stories were told of his powers and of his wonderful escapes from capture . He used to ride , single - handed , into the villages and the little towns on the Campo , driving a pack mule before him , with two revolvers in his belt , go straight to the shop or store , select what he wanted , and ride away unopposed because of the terror his exploits and his audacity inspired . Poor country people he usually left alone ; the upper class were often stopped on the roads and robbed ; but any unlucky official that fell into his hands was sure to get a severe flogging . The army officers did not like his name to be mentioned in their presence . His followers , mounted on stolen horses , laughed at the pursuit of the regular cavalry sent to hunt them down , and whom they took pleasure to ambush most scientifically in the broken ground of their own fastness . Expeditions had been fitted out ; a price had been put upon his head ; even attempts had been made , treacherously of course , to open negotiations with him , without in the slightest way affecting the even tenor of his career . At last , in true Costaguana fashion , the Fiscal of Tonoro , who was ambitious of the glory of having reduced the famous Hernandez , offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his band . But Hernandez evidently was not of the stuff of which the distinguished military politicians and conspirators of Costaguana are made . This clever but common device which frequently works like a charm in putting down revolutions failed with the chief of vulgar Salteadores . It promised well for the Fiscal at first , but ended very badly for the squadron of lanceros posted by the Fiscal 's directions in a fold of the ground into which Hernandez had promised to lead his unsuspecting followers They came , indeed , at the appointed time , but creeping on their hands and knees through the bush , and only let their presence be known by a general discharge of firearms , which emptied many saddles . The troopers who escaped came riding very hard into Tonoro . It is said that their commanding officer who , being better mounted , rode far ahead of the rest afterwards got into a state of despairing intoxication and beat the ambitious Fiscal severely with the flat of his sabre in the presence of his wife and daughters , for bringing this disgrace upon the National Army . The highest civil official of Tonoro , falling to the ground in a swoon , was further kicked all over the body and rowelled with sharp spurs about the neck and face because of the great sensitiveness of his military colleague . This gossip of the inland Campo , so characteristic of the rulers of the country with its story of oppression , inefficiency , fatuous methods , treachery , and savage brutality , was perfectly known to Mrs. Gould . That it should be accepted with no indignant comment by people of intelligence , refinement , and character as something inherent in the nature of things was one of the symptoms of degradation that had the power to exasperate her almost to the verge of despair . Still looking at the ingot of silver , she shook her head at Don Pepe 's remark - "
40408	40409	40410	40410	Senora	294	" "
40412	40420	40410	40410	Senora	294	" cried Don Pepe , with enthusiasm , "
40579	40599	40600	40600	my	0	" Mrs. Gould 's ride with the first silver escort to Sulaco was the closing episode of what she called "
40603	40834	40835	40835	You	1524	" before she had settled in her town - house permanently , as was proper and even necessary for the wife of the administrator of such an important institution as the San Tome mine . For the San Tome mine was to become an institution , a rallying point for everything in the province that needed order and stability to live . Security seemed to flow upon this land from the mountain - gorge . The authorities of Sulaco had learned that the San Tome mine could make it worth their while to leave things and people alone . This was the nearest approach to the rule of common - sense and justice Charles Gould felt it possible to secure at first . In fact , the mine , with its organization , its population growing fiercely attached to their position of privileged safety , with its armoury , with its Don Pepe , with its armed body of serenos where , it was said , many an outlaw and deserter - and even some members of Hernandez 's band - had found a place , the mine was a power in the land . As a certain prominent man in Sta . Marta had exclaimed with a hollow laugh , once , when discussing the line of action taken by the Sulaco authorities at a time of political crisis - "
40862	40918	40858	40858	I	0	" The prominent man who was then a person in power , with a lemon - coloured face and a very short and curly , not to say woolly , head of hair went so far in his temporary discontent as to shake his yellow fist under the nose of his interlocutor , and shriek - "
40961	41066	40955	40959	the officials of that Gould	1532	" Thereupon an intrepid but low and argumentative murmur would flow on for a space in the ministerial cabinet , and the prominent man 's passion would end in a cynical shrug of the shoulders . After all , he seemed to say , what did it matter as long as the minister himself was not forgotten during his brief day of authority ? But all the same , the unofficial agent of the San Tome mine , working for a good cause , had his moments of anxiety , which were reflected in his letters to Don Jose Avellanos , his maternal uncle . "
41090	41099	41073	41073	Marta	297	" Don Pepe used to assure Mrs. Gould . "
41119	41142	41112	41113	Senor Administrador	354	" But to Charles Gould , in his own room , the old Major would remark with a grim and soldierly cheeriness , "
41153	41159	41147	41147	our	1537	" Don Jose Avellanos would mutter "
41169	41278	41147	41147	our	1537	" with an air of profound self - satisfaction which , somehow , in a curious way , seemed to contain a queer admixture of bodily discomfort . But that , perhaps , could only be visible to the initiated . And for the initiated it was a wonderful place , this drawing - room of the Casa Gould , with its momentary glimpses of the master - El Senor Administrador - older , harder , mysteriously silent , with the lines deepened on his English , ruddy , out - of - doors complexion ; flitting on his thin cavalryman 's legs across the doorways , either just "
41283	41301	41147	41147	our	1537	" or with jingling spurs and riding - whip under his arm , on the point of starting "
41306	41385	41147	41147	our	1537	" Then Don Pepe , modestly martial in his chair , the llanero who seemed somehow to have found his martial jocularity , his knowledge of the world , and his manner perfect for his station , in the midst of savage armed contests with his kind ; Avellanos , polished and familiar , the diplomatist with his loquacity covering much caution and wisdom in delicate advice , with his manuscript of a historical work on Costaguana , entitled "
41391	41408	41147	41147	our	1537	" which , at present , he thought it was not prudent even if it were possible "
41414	41572	41147	41147	our	1537	" ; these three , and also Dona Emilia amongst them , gracious , small , and fairy - like , before the glittering tea - set , with one common master - thought in their heads , with one common feeling of a tense situation , with one ever - present aim to preserve the inviolable character of the mine at every cost . And there was also to be seen Captain Mitchell , a little apart , near one of the long windows , with an air of old - fashioned neat old bachelorhood about him , slightly pompous , in a white waistcoat , a little disregarded and unconscious of it ; utterly in the dark , and imagining himself to be in the thick of things . The good man , having spent a clear thirty years of his life on the high seas before getting what he called a ' shore billet , "

44166	44264	44152	44153	Mrs. Gould	248	" All this brings nearer the sort of future we desire for the country , which has waited for it in sorrow long enough , God knows . But I will confess that the other day , during my afternoon drive when I suddenly saw an Indian boy ride out of a wood with the red flag of a surveying party in his hand , I felt something of a shock . The future means change - an utter change . And yet even here there are simple and picturesque things that one would like to preserve . "
44282	44290	44291	44291	he	303	" General Montero is going to speak , "
44303	44318	44291	44291	he	303	" Heavens ! he 's going to propose my own health , I believe . "

44676	44681	44683	44684	Captain Mitchell	267	" Hear ! Hears ! "
44711	44727	44728	44728	he	303	" You were good enough to say that you intended to ask me for something , "
44734	44758	44759	44759	She	248	" What is it ? Be assured that any request from you would be considered in the light of a favour to myself . "
44774	44781	44782	44782	she	248	" Let us go on deck , "
44785	44803	44782	44782	she	248	" where I 'll be able to point out to you the very object of my request . "
45246	45272	45238	45238	he	250	" Certainly . Of course , my dear Mrs. Gould , for a protege of yours ! Not the slightest difficulty . Consider it done . "
45517	45540	45512	45513	Charles Gould	250	" All this piece of land belongs now to the Railway Company . There will be no more popular feasts held here . "

45718	45735	45736	45736	He	252	" Bene . Then the place must be named , It was not worth while before . "
45753	45767	45736	45736	He	252	" I shall set about the painting of the name to - morrow . "
45768	45779	45706	45706	he	252	" And what is it going to be , Giorgio ? "

46142	46153	46124	46125	old Giorgio	270	" The signora just said a word to the Englishman . "

46182	46217	46178	46178	Nostromo	251	" Buon viaggio , then . I 've guarded his bones all the way from the Entrada pass down to the plain and into Sulaco , as though he had been my own father . "
46255	46296	46297	46297	Viola	270	" And I have sat alone at night with my revolver in the Company 's warehouse time and again by the side of that other Englishman 's heap of silver , guarding it as though it had been my own . "

47201	47214	47215	47215	she	1775	" Has it come , then , ever beloved of my heart ? "
47218	47223	47215	47215	she	1775	" Is it true ? "
47224	47227	47229	47229	Nostromo	251	" No , "
47235	47249	47229	47229	Nostromo	251	" It was a lie . I love thee as much as ever . "
47250	47255	47256	47256	she	1775	" Is that true ? "
47268	47273	47256	47256	she	1775	" It is true . "
47274	47280	47229	47229	Nostromo	251	" True on the life ? "
47281	47305	47307	47308	the Capataz	269	" As true as that ; but thou must not ask me to swear it on the Madonna that stands in thy room . "
47331	47349	47350	47350	She	1775	" No , I will not ask for that . I can see love in your eyes . "
47358	47369	47370	47370	she	1775	" Why are you trembling like this ? From love ? "
47386	47416	47378	47379	the gombo	1780	" But if you love her as much as that , you must give your Paquita a gold - mounted rosary of beads for the neck of her Madonna . "
47417	47420	47422	47422	Nostromo	251	" No , "
47439	47457	47458	47458	she	1775	" No ? Then what else will your worship give me on the day of the fiesta ? "
47475	47476	47458	47458	she	1775	" "
47492	47493	47458	47458	she	1775	" "
47508	47609	47610	47610	Juan	365	" she flared up , sarcastically . Laughs were heard at her anger , at her retort . What an audacious spitfire she was ! The people aware of this scene were calling out urgently to others in the crowd . The circle round the silver - grey mare narrowed slowly . The girl went off a pace or two , confronting the mocking curiosity of the eyes , then flung back to the stirrup , tiptoeing , her enraged face turned up to Nostromo with a pair of blazing eyes . He bent low to her in the saddle . "
47612	47616	47610	47610	Juan	365	" she hissed , "
47625	47657	47617	47617	I	0	" The dreaded Capataz de Cargadores , magnificent and carelessly public in his amours , flung his arm round her neck and kissed her spluttering lips . A murmur went round . "
47661	47719	47617	47617	I	0	" he demanded at large , holding her firmly by the shoulder . Twenty blades flashed out together in the circle . A young man in holiday attire , bounding in , thrust one in Nostromo 's hand and bounded back into the ranks , very proud of himself . Nostromo had not even looked at him . "
47725	47765	47617	47617	I	0	" he commanded the girl , who , suddenly subdued , rose lightly , and when he had her up , encircling her waist , her face near to his , he pressed the knife into her little hand . "
47778	47782	47770	47770	You	366	" he said . "
47814	48037	47803	47803	you	366	" There were shouts of laughter and applause at this witty freak , while the girl passed the keen blade , and the impassive rider jingled in his palm the increasing hoard of silver buttons . He eased her to the ground with both her hands full . After whispering for a while with a very strenuous face , she walked away , staring haughtily , and vanished into the crowd . The circle had broken up , and the lordly Capataz de Cargadores , the indispensable man , the tried and trusty Nostromo , the Mediterranean sailor come ashore casually to try his luck in Costaguana , rode slowly towards the harbour . The Juno was just then swinging round ; and even as Nostromo reined up again to look on , a flag ran up on the improvised flagstaff erected in an ancient and dismantled little fort at the harbour entrance . Half a battery of field guns had been hurried over there from the Sulaco barracks for the purpose of firing the regulation salutes for the President - Dictator and the War Minister . As the mail - boat headed through the pass , the badly timed reports announced the end of Don Vincente Ribiera 's first official visit to Sulaco , and for Captain Mitchell the end of another "
48041	48046	47803	47803	you	366	" Next time when the "
48051	48116	47803	47803	you	366	" was to come that way , a year and a half later , it was unofficially , over the mountain tracks , fleeing after a defeat on a lame mule , to be only just saved by Nostromo from an ignominious death at the hands of a mob . It was a very different event , of which Captain Mitchell used to say - "
48147	48170	48126	48129	that fellow of mine	1788	" But this event , creditable to Nostromo , was to lead immediately to another , which could not be classed either as "
48172	48175	48126	48129	that fellow of mine	1788	" or as "
48178	48192	48126	48129	that fellow of mine	1788	" in Captain Mitchell 's phraseology . He had another word for it . "
48194	48201	48126	48129	that fellow of mine	1788	" he used to say afterwards , "
48261	48289	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" PART SECOND THE ISABELS CHAPTER ONE Through good and evil report in the varying fortune of that struggle which Don Jose had characterized in the phrase , "
48300	48305	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" the Gould Concession , "
48310	48799	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" had gone on working ; the square mountain had gone on pouring its treasure down the wooden shoots to the unresting batteries of stamps ; the lights of San Tome had twinkled night after night upon the great , limitless shadow of the Campo ; every three months the silver escort had gone down to the sea as if neither the war nor its consequences could ever affect the ancient Occidental State secluded beyond its high barrier of the Cordillera . All the fighting took place on the other side of that mighty wall of serrated peaks lorded over by the white dome of Higuerota and as yet unbreached by the railway , of which only the first part , the easy Campo part from Sulaco to the Ivie Valley at the foot of the pass , had been laid . Neither did the telegraph line cross the mountains yet ; its poles , like slender beacons on the plain , penetrated into the forest fringe of the foot - hills cut by the deep avenue of the track ; and its wire ended abruptly in the construction camp at a white deal table supporting a Morse apparatus , in a long hut of planks with a corrugated iron roof overshadowed by gigantic cedar trees - the quarters of the engineer in charge of the advance section . The harbour was busy , too , with the traffic in railway material , and with the movements of troops along the coast . The O.S.N. Company found much occupation for its fleet . Costaguana had no navy , and , apart from a few coastguard cutters , there were no national ships except a couple of old merchant steamers used as transports . Captain Mitchell , feeling more and more in the thick of history , found time for an hour or so during an afternoon in the drawing - room of the Casa Gould , where , with a strange ignorance of the real forces at work around him , he professed himself delighted to get away from the strain of affairs . He did not know what he would have done without his invaluable Nostromo , he declared . Those confounded Costaguana politics gave him more work - he confided to Mrs. Gould - than he had bargained for . Don Jose Avellanos had displayed in the service of the endangered Ribiera Government an organizing activity and an eloquence of which the echoes reached even Europe . For , after the new loan to the Ribiera Government , Europe had become interested in Costaguana . The Sala of the Provincial Assembly in the Municipal Buildings of Sulaco , with its portraits of the Liberators on the walls and an old flag of Cortez preserved in a glass case above the President 's chair , had heard all these speeches - the early one containing the impassioned declaration "
48805	48811	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" the famous one of the "
48814	48966	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" delivered on the occasion of the vote for the raising of a second Sulaco regiment in the defence of the reforming Government ; and when the provinces again displayed their old flags proscribed in Guzman Bento 's time there was another of those great orations , when Don Jose greeted these old emblems of the war of Independence , brought out again in the name of new Ideals . The old idea of Federalism had disappeared . For his part he did not wish to revive old political doctrines . They were perishable . They died . But the doctrine of political rectitude was immortal . The second Sulaco regiment , to whom he was presenting this flag , was going to show its valour in a contest for order , peace , progress ; for the establishment of national self - respect without which - he declared with energy - "
48981	49880	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" Don Jose Avellanos loved his country . He had served it lavishly with his fortune during his diplomatic career , and the later story of his captivity and barbarous ill - usage under Guzman Bento was well known to his listeners . It was a wonder that he had not been a victim of the ferocious and summary executions which marked the course of that tyranny ; for Guzman had ruled the country with the sombre imbecility of political fanaticism . The power of Supreme Government had become in his dull mind an object of strange worship , as if it were some sort of cruel deity . It was incarnated in himself , and his adversaries , the Federalists , were the supreme sinners , objects of hate , abhorrence , and fear , as heretics would be to a convinced Inquisitor . For years he had carried about at the tail of the Army of Pacification , all over the country , a captive band of such atrocious criminals , who considered themselves most unfortunate at not having been summarily executed . It was a diminishing company of nearly naked skeletons , loaded with irons , covered with dirt , with vermin , with raw wounds , all men of position , of education , of wealth , who had learned to fight amongst themselves for scraps of rotten beef thrown to them by soldiers , or to beg a negro cook for a drink of muddy water in pitiful accents . Don Jose Avellanos , clanking his chains amongst the others , seemed only to exist in order to prove how much hunger , pain , degradation , and cruel torture a human body can stand without parting with the last spark of life . Sometimes interrogatories , backed by some primitive method of torture , were administered to them by a commission of officers hastily assembled in a hut of sticks and branches , and made pitiless by the fear for their own lives . A lucky one or two of that spectral company of prisoners would perhaps be led tottering behind a bush to be shot by a file of soldiers . Always an army chaplain - some unshaven , dirty man , girt with a sword and with a tiny cross embroidered in white cotton on the left breast of a lieutenant 's uniform - would follow , cigarette in the corner of the mouth , wooden stool in hand , to hear the confession and give absolution ; for the Citizen Saviour of the Country Guzman Bento was called thus officially in petitions was not averse from the exercise of rational clemency . The irregular report of the firing squad would be heard , followed sometimes by a single finishing shot ; a little bluish cloud of smoke would float up above the green bushes , and the Army of Pacification would move on over the savannas , through the forests , crossing rivers , invading rural pueblos , devastating the haciendas of the horrid aristocrats , occupying the inland towns in the fulfilment of its patriotic mission , and leaving behind a united land wherein the evil taint of Federalism could no longer be detected in the smoke of burning houses and the smell of spilt blood . Don Jose Avellanos had survived that time . Perhaps , when contemptuously signifying to him his release , the Citizen Saviour of the Country might have thought this benighted aristocrat too broken in health and spirit and fortune to be any longer dangerous . Or , perhaps , it may have been a simple caprice . Guzman Bento , usually full of fanciful fears and brooding suspicions , had sudden accesses of unreasonable self - confidence when he perceived himself elevated on a pinnacle of power and safety beyond the reach of mere mortal plotters . At such times he would impulsively command the celebration of a solemn Mass of thanksgiving , which would be sung in great pomp in the cathedral of Sta . Marta by the trembling , subservient Archbishop of his creation . He heard it sitting in a gilt armchair placed before the high altar , surrounded by the civil and military heads of his Government . The unofficial world of Sta . Marta would crowd into the cathedral , for it was not quite safe for anybody of mark to stay away from these manifestations of presidential piety . Having thus acknowledged the only power he was at all disposed to recognize as above himself , he would scatter acts of political grace in a sardonic wantonness of clemency . There was no other way left now to enjoy his power but by seeing his crushed adversaries crawl impotently into the light of day out of the dark , noisome cells of the Collegio . Their harmlessness fed his insatiable vanity , and they could always be got hold of again . It was the rule for all the women of their families to present thanks afterwards in a special audience . The incarnation of that strange god , El Gobierno Supremo , received them standing , cocked hat on head , and exhorted them in a menacing mutter to show their gratitude by bringing up their children in fidelity to the democratic form of government , "
49892	50023	50024	50025	poor papa	1798	" His front teeth having been knocked out in some accident of his former herdsman 's life , his utterance was spluttering and indistinct . He had been working for Costaguana alone in the midst of treachery and opposition . Let it cease now lest he should become weary of forgiving ! Don Jose Avellanos had known this forgiveness . He was broken in health and fortune deplorably enough to present a truly gratifying spectacle to the supreme chief of democratic institutions . He retired to Sulaco . His wife had an estate in that province , and she nursed him back to life out of the house of death and captivity . When she died , their daughter , an only child , was old enough to devote herself to "
50027	50206	50024	50025	poor papa	1798	" Miss Avellanos , born in Europe and educated partly in England , was a tall , grave girl , with a self - possessed manner , a wide , white forehead , a wealth of rich brown hair , and blue eyes . The other young ladies of Sulaco stood in awe of her character and accomplishments . She was reputed to be terribly learned and serious . As to pride , it was well known that all the Corbelans were proud , and her mother was a Corbelan . Don Jose Avellanos depended very much upon the devotion of his beloved Antonia . He accepted it in the benighted way of men , who , though made in God 's image , are like stone idols without sense before the smoke of certain burnt offerings . He was ruined in every way , but a man possessed of passion is not a bankrupt in life . Don Jose Avellanos desired passionately for his country : peace , prosperity , and as the end of the preface to "
50211	50214	48256	48258	the same man	1792	" has it "
50225	50561	50562	50562	Emilia	307	" In this last phrase the Minister Plenipotentiary , cruelly humiliated by the bad faith of his Government towards the foreign bondholders , stands disclosed in the patriot . The fatuous turmoil of greedy factions succeeding the tyranny of Guzman Bento seemed to bring his desire to the very door of opportunity . He was too old to descend personally into the centre of the arena at Sta . Marta . But the men who acted there sought his advice at every step . He himself thought that he could be most useful at a distance , in Sulaco . His name , his connections , his former position , his experience commanded the respect of his class . The discovery that this man , living in dignified poverty in the Corbelan town residence opposite the Casa Gould , could dispose of material means towards the support of the cause increased his influence . It was his open letter of appeal that decided the candidature of Don Vincente Ribiera for the Presidency . Another of these informal State papers drawn up by Don Jose this time in the shape of an address from the Province induced that scrupulous constitutionalist to accept the extraordinary powers conferred upon him for five years by an overwhelming vote of congress in Sta . Marta . It was a specific mandate to establish the prosperity of the people on the basis of firm peace at home , and to redeem the national credit by the satisfaction of all just claims abroad . On the afternoon the news of that vote had reached Sulaco by the usual roundabout postal way through Cayta , and up the coast by steamer . Don Jose , who had been waiting for the mail in the Goulds ' drawing - room , got out of the rocking - chair , letting his hat fall off his knees . He rubbed his silvery , short hair with both hands , speechless with the excess of joy . "
50567	50573	50562	50562	Emilia	307	" he had burst out , "
50582	50694	50580	50580	me	0	" Captain Mitchell , had he been there , would no doubt have made an apt remark about the dawn of a new era ; but if Don Jose thought something of the kind , his eloquence failed him on this occasion . The inspirer of that revival of the Blanco party tottered where he stood . Mrs. Gould moved forward quickly and , as she offered her cheek with a smile to her old friend , managed very cleverly to give him the support of her arm he really needed . Don Jose had recovered himself at once , but for a time he could do no more than murmur , "
50707	50764	50703	50705	you two patriots	1801	" - looking from one to the other . Vague plans of another historical work , wherein all the devotions to the regeneration of the country he loved would be enshrined for the reverent worship of posterity , flitted through his mind . The historian who had enough elevation of soul to write of Guzman Bento : "
50843	50859	50840	50840	his	1803	" the man who could write thus of a cruel persecutor the passage occurs in his "
50863	50945	50840	50840	his	1803	" felt at the foreshadowing of success an almost boundless affection for his two helpers , for these two young people from over the sea . Just as years ago , calmly , from the conviction of practical necessity , stronger than any abstract political doctrine , Henry Gould had drawn the sword , so now , the times being changed , Charles Gould had flung the silver of the San Tome into the fray . The Inglez of Sulaco , the "
50948	51269	51270	51270	You	1806	" of the third generation , was as far from being a political intriguer as his uncle from a revolutionary swashbuckler . Springing from the instinctive uprightness of their natures their action was reasoned . They saw an opportunity and used the weapon to hand . Charles Gould 's position - a commanding position in the background of that attempt to retrieve the peace and the credit of the Republic - was very clear . At the beginning he had had to accommodate himself to existing circumstances of corruption so naively brazen as to disarm the hate of a man courageous enough not to be afraid of its irresponsible potency to ruin everything it touched . It seemed to him too contemptible for hot anger even . He made use of it with a cold , fearless scorn , manifested rather than concealed by the forms of stony courtesy which did away with much of the ignominy of the situation . At bottom , perhaps , he suffered from it , for he was not a man of cowardly illusions , but he refused to discuss the ethical view with his wife . He trusted that , though a little disenchanted , she would be intelligent enough to understand that his character safeguarded the enterprise of their lives as much or more than his policy . The extraordinary development of the mine had put a great power into his hands . To feel that prosperity always at the mercy of unintelligent greed had grown irksome to him . To Mrs. Gould it was humiliating . At any rate , it was dangerous . In the confidential communications passing between Charles Gould , the King of Sulaco , and the head of the silver and steel interests far away in California , the conviction was growing that any attempt made by men of education and integrity ought to be discreetly supported . "
51281	51364	51277	51277	I	0	" Mr. Holroyd had written at the proper moment from his inviolable sanctuary within the eleven - storey high factory of great affairs . And shortly afterwards , with a credit opened by the Third Southern Bank located next door but one to the Holroyd Building , the Ribierist party in Costaguana took a practical shape under the eye of the administrator of the San Tome mine . And Don Jose , the hereditary friend of the Gould family , could say : "
51379	51407	51371	51371	I	0	" CHAPTER TWO After another armed struggle , decided by Montero 's victory of Rio Seco , had been added to the tale of civil wars , the "
51411	51478	51480	51480	Montero	304	" as Don Jose called them , could breathe freely for the first time in half a century . The Five - Year - Mandate law became the basis of that regeneration , the passionate desire and hope for which had been like the elixir of everlasting youth for Don Jose Avellanos . And when it was suddenly - and not quite unexpectedly - endangered by that "
51482	51846	51480	51480	Montero	304	" it was a passionate indignation that gave him a new lease of life , as it were . Already , at the time of the President - Dictator 's visit to Sulaco , Moraga had sounded a note of warning from Sta . Marta about the War Minister . Montero and his brother made the subject of an earnest talk between the Dictator - President and the Nestor - inspirer of the party . But Don Vincente , a doctor of philosophy from the Cordova University , seemed to have an exaggerated respect for military ability , whose mysteriousness - since it appeared to be altogether independent of intellect - imposed upon his imagination . The victor of Rio Seco was a popular hero . His services were so recent that the President - Dictator quailed before the obvious charge of political ingratitude . Great regenerating transactions were being initiated - the fresh loan , a new railway line , a vast colonization scheme . Anything that could unsettle the public opinion in the capital was to be avoided . Don Jose bowed to these arguments and tried to dismiss from his mind the gold - laced portent in boots , and with a sabre , made meaningless now at last , he hoped , in the new order of things . Less than six months after the President - Dictator 's visit , Sulaco learned with stupefaction of the military revolt in the name of national honour . The Minister of War , in a barrack - square allocution to the officers of the artillery regiment he had been inspecting , had declared the national honour sold to foreigners . The Dictator , by his weak compliance with the demands of the European powers - for the settlement of long outstanding money claims - had showed himself unfit to rule . A letter from Moraga explained afterwards that the initiative , and even the very text , of the incendiary allocution came , in reality , from the other Montero , the ex - guerillero , the Commandante de Plaza . The energetic treatment of Dr. Monygham , sent for in haste "
51851	52022	51480	51480	Montero	304	" who came galloping three leagues in the dark , saved Don Jose from a dangerous attack of jaundice . After getting over the shock , Don Jose refused to let himself be prostrated . Indeed , better news succeeded at first . The revolt in the capital had been suppressed after a night of fighting in the streets . Unfortunately , both the Monteros had been able to make their escape south , to their native province of Entre - Montes . The hero of the forest march , the victor of Rio Seco , had been received with frenzied acclamations in Nicoya , the provincial capital . The troops in garrison there had gone to him in a body . The brothers were organizing an army , gathering malcontents , sending emissaries primed with patriotic lies to the people , and with promises of plunder to the wild llaneros . Even a Monterist press had come into existence , speaking oracularly of the secret promises of support given by "
52030	52047	51480	51480	Montero	304	" against the sinister land - grabbing designs of European powers , cursing in every issue the "
52051	52831	51480	51480	Montero	304	" who had plotted to deliver his country , bound hand and foot , for a prey to foreign speculators . Sulaco , pastoral and sleepy , with its opulent Campo and the rich silver mine , heard the din of arms fitfully in its fortunate isolation . It was nevertheless in the very forefront of the defence with men and money ; but the very rumours reached it circuitously - from abroad even , so much was it cut off from the rest of the Republic , not only by natural obstacles , but also by the vicissitudes of the war . The Monteristos were besieging Cayta , an important postal link . The overland couriers ceased to come across the mountains , and no muleteer would consent to risk the journey at last ; even Bonifacio on one occasion failed to return from Sta . Marta , either not daring to start , or perhaps captured by the parties of the enemy raiding the country between the Cordillera and the capital . Monterist publications , however , found their way into the province , mysteriously enough ; and also Monterist emissaries preaching death to aristocrats in the villages and towns of the Campo . Very early , at the beginning of the trouble , Hernandez , the bandit , had proposed through the agency of an old priest of a village in the wilds to deliver two of them to the Ribierist authorities in Tonoro . They had come to offer him a free pardon and the rank of colonel from General Montero in consideration of joining the rebel army with his mounted band . No notice was taken at the time of the proposal . It was joined , as an evidence of good faith , to a petition praying the Sulaco Assembly for permission to enlist , with all his followers , in the forces being then raised in Sulaco for the defence of the Five - Year Mandate of regeneration . The petition , like everything else , had found its way into Don Jose 's hands . He had showed to Mrs. Gould these pages of dirty - greyish rough paper perhaps looted in some village store , covered with the crabbed , illiterate handwriting of the old padre , carried off from his hut by the side of a mud - walled church to be the secretary of the dreaded Salteador . They had both bent in the lamplight of the Gould drawing - room over the document containing the fierce and yet humble appeal of the man against the blind and stupid barbarity turning an honest ranchero into a bandit . A postscript of the priest stated that , but for being deprived of his liberty for ten days , he had been treated with humanity and the respect due to his sacred calling . He had been , it appears , confessing and absolving the chief and most of the band , and he guaranteed the sincerity of their good disposition . He had distributed heavy penances , no doubt in the way of litanies and fasts ; but he argued shrewdly that it would be difficult for them to make their peace with God durably till they had made peace with men . Never before , perhaps , had Hernandez 's head been in less jeopardy than when he petitioned humbly for permission to buy a pardon for himself and his gang of deserters by armed service . He could range afar from the waste lands protecting his fastness , unchecked , because there were no troops left in the whole province . The usual garrison of Sulaco had gone south to the war , with its brass band playing the Bolivar march on the bridge of one of the O.S.N. Company 's steamers . The great family coaches drawn up along the shore of the harbour were made to rock on the high leathern springs by the enthusiasm of the senoras and the senoritas standing up to wave their lace handkerchiefs , as lighter after lighter packed full of troops left the end of the jetty . Nostromo directed the embarkation , under the superintendendence of Captain Mitchell , red - faced in the sun , conspicuous in a white waistcoat , representing the allied and anxious goodwill of all the material interests of civilization . General Barrios , who commanded the troops , assured Don Jose on parting that in three weeks he would have Montero in a wooden cage drawn by three pair of oxen ready for a tour through all the towns of the Republic . "
52837	52855	52835	52835	senora	1489	" he continued , baring his curly iron - grey head to Mrs. Gould in her landau - "
52945	53069	52939	52939	his	374	" Charles Gould was not present at the anxious and patriotic send - off . It was not his part to see the soldiers embark . It was neither his part , nor his inclination , nor his policy . His part , his inclination , and his policy were united in one endeavour to keep unchecked the flow of treasure he had started single - handed from the re - opened scar in the flank of the mountain . As the mine developed he had trained for himself some native help . There were foremen , artificers and clerks , with Don Pepe for the gobernador of the mining population . For the rest his shoulders alone sustained the whole weight of the "
53074	53998	52939	52939	his	374	" the great Gould Concession whose mere shadow had been enough to crush the life out of his father . Mrs. Gould had no silver mine to look after . In the general life of the Gould Concession she was represented by her two lieutenants , the doctor and the priest , but she fed her woman 's love of excitement on events whose significance was purified to her by the fire of her imaginative purpose . On that day she had brought the Avellanos , father and daughter , down to the harbour with her . Amongst his other activities of that stirring time , Don Jose had become the chairman of a Patriotic Committee which had armed a great proportion of troops in the Sulaco command with an improved model of a military rifle . It had been just discarded for something still more deadly by one of the great European powers . How much of the market - price for second - hand weapons was covered by the voluntary contributions of the principal families , and how much came from those funds Don Jose was understood to command abroad , remained a secret which he alone could have disclosed ; but the Ricos , as the populace called them , had contributed under the pressure of their Nestor 's eloquence . Some of the more enthusiastic ladies had been moved to bring offerings of jewels into the hands of the man who was the life and soul of the party . There were moments when both his life and his soul seemed overtaxed by so many years of undiscouraged belief in regeneration . He appeared almost inanimate , sitting rigidly by the side of Mrs. Gould in the landau , with his fine , old , clean - shaven face of a uniform tint as if modelled in yellow wax , shaded by a soft felt hat , the dark eyes looking out fixedly . Antonia , the beautiful Antonia , as Miss Avellanos was called in Sulaco , leaned back , facing them ; and her full figure , the grave oval of her face with full red lips , made her look more mature than Mrs. Gould , with her mobile expression and small , erect person under a slightly swaying sunshade . Whenever possible Antonia attended her father ; her recognized devotion weakened the shocking effect of her scorn for the rigid conventions regulating the life of Spanish - American girlhood . And , in truth , she was no longer girlish . It was said that she often wrote State papers from her father 's dictation , and was allowed to read all the books in his library . At the receptions - where the situation was saved by the presence of a very decrepit old lady a relation of the Corbelans , quite deaf and motionless in an armchair - Antonia could hold her own in a discussion with two or three men at a time . Obviously she was not the girl to be content with peeping through a barred window at a cloaked figure of a lover ensconced in a doorway opposite - which is the correct form of Costaguana courtship . It was generally believed that with her foreign upbringing and foreign ideas the learned and proud Antonia would never marry - unless , indeed , she married a foreigner from Europe or North America , now that Sulaco seemed on the point of being invaded by all the world . CHAPTER THREE When General Barrios stopped to address Mrs. Gould , Antonia raised negligently her hand holding an open fan , as if to shade from the sun her head , wrapped in a light lace shawl . The clear gleam of her blue eyes gliding behind the black fringe of eyelashes paused for a moment upon her father , then travelled further to the figure of a young man of thirty at most , of medium height , rather thick - set , wearing a light overcoat . Bearing down with the open palm of his hand upon the knob of a flexible cane , he had been looking on from a distance ; but directly he saw himself noticed , he approached quietly and put his elbow over the door of the landau . The shirt collar , cut low in the neck , the big bow of his cravat , the style of his clothing , from the round hat to the varnished shoes , suggested an idea of French elegance ; but otherwise he was the very type of a fair Spanish creole . The fluffy moustache and the short , curly , golden beard did not conceal his lips , rosy , fresh , almost pouting in expression . His full , round face was of that warm , healthy creole white which is never tanned by its native sunshine . Martin Decoud was seldom exposed to the Costaguana sun under which he was born . His people had been long settled in Paris , where he had studied law , had dabbled in literature , had hoped now and then in moments of exaltation to become a poet like that other foreigner of Spanish blood , Jose Maria Heredia . In other moments he had , to pass the time , condescended to write articles on European affairs for the Semenario , the principal newspaper in Sta . Marta , which printed them under the heading "
54004	54032	54000	54002	our special correspondent	1820	" though the authorship was an open secret . Everybody in Costaguana , where the tale of compatriots in Europe is jealously kept , knew that it was "
54037	54158	54033	54035	the son Decoud	1821	" a talented young man , supposed to be moving in the higher spheres of Society . As a matter of fact , he was an idle boulevardier , in touch with some smart journalists , made free of a few newspaper offices , and welcomed in the pleasure haunts of pressmen . This life , whose dreary superficiality is covered by the glitter of universal blague , like the stupid clowning of a harlequin by the spangles of a motley costume , induced in him a Frenchified - but most un - French - cosmopolitanism , in reality a mere barren indifferentism posing as intellectual superiority . Of his own country he used to say to his French associates : "
54353	54473	54475	54475	you	1835	" And he would explain with railing verve what Don Vincente Ribiera stood for - a mournful little man oppressed by his own good intentions , the significance of battles won , who Montero was un grotesque vaniteux et feroce , and the manner of the new loan connected with railway development , and the colonization of vast tracts of land in one great financial scheme . And his French friends would remark that evidently this little fellow Decoud connaissait la question a fond . An important Parisian review asked him for an article on the situation . It was composed in a serious tone and in a spirit of levity . Afterwards he asked one of his intimates - "
54491	54582	54475	54475	you	1835	" He imagined himself Parisian to the tips of his fingers . But far from being that he was in danger of remaining a sort of nondescript dilettante all his life . He had pushed the habit of universal raillery to a point where it blinded him to the genuine impulses of his own nature . To be suddenly selected for the executive member of the patriotic small - arms committee of Sulaco seemed to him the height of the unexpected , one of those fantastic moves of which only his "
54585	54589	54475	54475	you	1835	" were capable . "
54627	54655	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" he had exclaimed to his favourite sister ; for the Decoud family - except the old father and mother - used the French language amongst themselves . "
54674	54693	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" This letter , in Antonia 's handwriting , was signed by Don Jose , who appealed to the "
54698	54739	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" on public grounds , and privately opened his heart to his talented god - son , a man of wealth and leisure , with wide relations , and by his parentage and bringing - up worthy of all confidence . "
54743	54753	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" Martin commented , cynically , to his sister , "
54773	54848	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" The whole thing was being carried out behind the back of the War Minister , Montero , a mistrusted member of the Ribiera Government , but difficult to get rid of at once . He was not to know anything of it till the troops under Barrios 's command had the new rifle in their hands . The President - Dictator , whose position was very difficult , was alone in the secret . "
54852	54876	54621	54622	military rifles	1836	" commented Martin 's sister and confidante ; to which the brother , with an air of best Parisian blague , had retorted : "
54915	54969	54989	54989	swindlers	1519	" And he laughed immoderately . Afterwards his sister was surprised at the earnestness and ability he displayed in carrying out his mission , which circumstances made delicate , and his want of special knowledge rendered difficult . She had never seen Martin take so much trouble about anything in his whole life . "
54974	54981	54989	54989	swindlers	1519	" he had explained , briefly . "
55035	55107	55108	55108	I	0	" When the business was concluded he declared suddenly his intention of seeing the precious consignment delivered safely in Sulaco . The whole burlesque business , he thought , was worth following up to the end . He mumbled his excuses , tugging at his golden beard , before the acute young lady who after the first wide stare of astonishment looked at him with narrowed eyes , and pronounced slowly - "
55116	55117	55114	55114	Antonia	256	" "
55121	55154	55119	55119	Antonia	256	" asked the Costaguana boulevardier , in a vexed and disdainful tone . He shrugged his shoulders , and spun round on his heel . His sister called out after him joyously - "
55173	55490	55162	55162	she	256	" He had known her some eight years since , shortly before the Avellanos had left Europe for good , as a tall girl of sixteen , youthfully austere , and of a character already so formed that she ventured to treat slightingly his pose of disabused wisdom . On one occasion , as though she had lost all patience , she flew out at him about the aimlessness of his life and the levity of his opinions . He was twenty then , an only son , spoiled by his adoring family . This attack disconcerted him so greatly that he had faltered in his affectation of amused superiority before that insignificant chit of a school - girl . But the impression left was so strong that ever since all the girl friends of his sisters recalled to him Antonia Avellanos by some faint resemblance , or by the great force of contrast . It was , he told himself , like a ridiculous fatality . And , of course , in the news the Decouds received regularly from Costaguana , the name of their friends , the Avellanos , cropped up frequently - the arrest and the abominable treatment of the ex - Minister , the dangers and hardships endured by the family , its withdrawal in poverty to Sulaco , the death of the mother . The Monterist pronunciamento had taken place before Martin Decoud reached Costaguana . He came out in a roundabout way , through Magellan 's Straits by the main line and the West Coast Service of the O.S.N. Company . His precious consignment arrived just in time to convert the first feelings of consternation into a mood of hope and resolution . Publicly he was made much of by the familias principales . Privately Don Jose , still shaken and weak , embraced him with tears in his eyes . "
55515	55641	55642	55642	I	0	" he moaned , affectionately . And again he hugged his god - son . This was indeed the time for men of intellect and conscience to rally round the endangered cause . It was then that Martin Decoud , the adopted child of Western Europe , felt the absolute change of atmosphere . He submitted to being embraced and talked to without a word . He was moved in spite of himself by that note of passion and sorrow unknown on the more refined stage of European politics . But when the tall Antonia , advancing with her light step in the dimness of the big bare Sala of the Avellanos house , offered him her hand in her emancipated way , and murmured , "
55653	55864	55650	55651	Don Martin	257	" he felt how impossible it would be to tell these two people that he had intended to go away by the next month 's packet . Don Jose , meantime , continued his praises . Every accession added to public confidence , and , besides , what an example to the young men at home from the brilliant defender of the country 's regeneration , the worthy expounder of the party 's political faith before the world ! Everybody had read the magnificent article in the famous Parisian Review . The world was now informed : and the author 's appearance at this moment was like a public act of faith . Young Decoud felt overcome by a feeling of impatient confusion . His plan had been to return by way of the United States through California , visit Yellowstone Park , see Chicago , Niagara , have a look at Canada , perhaps make a short stay in New York , a longer one in Newport , use his letters of introduction . The pressure of Antonia 's hand was so frank , the tone of her voice was so unexpectedly unchanged in its approving warmth , that all he found to say after his low bow was - "
55897	55898	55890	55891	Dona Antonia	380	" "
55904	55921	55890	55891	Dona Antonia	380	" she said , with that perfectly calm openness of manner which characterized all her utterances . "
55942	56234	55931	55931	one	994	" Martin Decoud said nothing of his plans . He not only never breathed a word of them to any one , but only a fortnight later asked the mistress of the Casa Gould where he had of course obtained admission at once , leaning forward in his chair with an air of well - bred familiarity , whether she could not detect in him that day a marked change - an air , he explained , of more excellent gravity . At this Mrs. Gould turned her face full towards him with the silent inquiry of slightly widened eyes and the merest ghost of a smile , an habitual movement with her , which was very fascinating to men by something subtly devoted , finely self - forgetful in its lively readiness of attention . Because , Decoud continued imperturbably , he felt no longer an idle cumberer of the earth . She was , he assured her , actually beholding at that moment the Journalist of Sulaco . At once Mrs. Gould glanced towards Antonia , posed upright in the corner of a high , straight - backed Spanish sofa , a large black fan waving slowly against the curves of her fine figure , the tips of crossed feet peeping from under the hem of the black skirt . Decoud 's eyes also remained fixed there , while in an undertone he added that Miss Avellanos was quite aware of his new and unexpected vocation , which in Costaguana was generally the speciality of half - educated negroes and wholly penniless lawyers . Then , confronting with a sort of urbane effrontery Mrs. Gould 's gaze , now turned sympathetically upon himself , he breathed out the words , "
56238	56265	55931	55931	one	994	" What had happened was that he had all at once yielded to Don Jose 's pressing entreaties to take the direction of a newspaper that would "
56273	56535	55931	55931	one	994	" It had been Don Jose 's old and cherished idea . The necessary plant on a modest scale and a large consignment of paper had been received from America some time before ; the right man alone was wanted . Even Senor Moraga in Sta . Marta had not been able to find one , and the matter was now becoming pressing ; some organ was absolutely needed to counteract the effect of the lies disseminated by the Monterist press : the atrocious calumnies , the appeals to the people calling upon them to rise with their knives in their hands and put an end once for all to the Blancos , to these Gothic remnants , to these sinister mummies , these impotent paraliticos , who plotted with foreigners for the surrender of the lands and the slavery of the people . The clamour of this Negro Liberalism frightened Senor Avellanos . A newspaper was the only remedy . And now that the right man had been found in Decoud , great black letters appeared painted between the windows above the arcaded ground floor of a house on the Plaza . It was next to Anzani 's great emporium of boots , silks , ironware , muslins , wooden toys , tiny silver arms , legs , heads , hearts for ex - voto offerings , rosaries , champagne , women 's hats , patent medicines , even a few dusty books in paper covers and mostly in the French language . The big black letters formed the words , "
56541	57060	57061	57061	Senora	294	" From these offices a single folded sheet of Martin 's journalism issued three times a week ; and the sleek yellow Anzani prowling in a suit of ample black and carpet slippers , before the many doors of his establishment , greeted by a deep , side - long inclination of his body the Journalist of Sulaco going to and fro on the business of his august calling . CHAPTER FOUR Perhaps it was in the exercise of his calling that he had come to see the troops depart . The Porvenir of the day after next would no doubt relate the event , but its editor , leaning his side against the landau , seemed to look at nothing . The front rank of the company of infantry drawn up three deep across the shore end of the jetty when pressed too close would bring their bayonets to the charge ferociously , with an awful rattle ; and then the crowd of spectators swayed back bodily , even under the noses of the big white mules . Notwithstanding the great multitude there was only a low , muttering noise ; the dust hung in a brown haze , in which the horsemen , wedged in the throng here and there , towered from the hips upwards , gazing all one way over the heads . Almost every one of them had mounted a friend , who steadied himself with both hands grasping his shoulders from behind ; and the rims of their hats touching , made like one disc sustaining the cones of two pointed crowns with a double face underneath . A hoarse mozo would bawl out something to an acquaintance in the ranks , or a woman would shriek suddenly the word Adios ! followed by the Christian name of a man . General Barrios , in a shabby blue tunic and white peg - top trousers falling upon strange red boots , kept his head uncovered and stooped slightly , propping himself up with a thick stick . No ! He had earned enough military glory to satiate any man , he insisted to Mrs. Gould , trying at the same time to put an air of gallantry into his attitude . A few jetty hairs hung sparsely from his upper lip , he had a salient nose , a thin , long jaw , and a black silk patch over one eye . His other eye , small and deep - set , twinkled erratically in all directions , aimlessly affable . The few European spectators , all men , who had naturally drifted into the neighbourhood of the Gould carriage , betrayed by the solemnity of their faces their impression that the general must have had too much punch Swedish punch , imported in bottles by Anzani at the Amarilla Club before he had started with his Staff on a furious ride to the harbour . But Mrs. Gould bent forward , self - possessed , and declared her conviction that still more glory awaited the general in the near future . "
57063	57071	57061	57061	Senora	294	" he remonstrated , with great feeling , "
57103	57171	57093	57101	that bald - headed embustero with the dyed moustaches	1858	" Pablo Ignacio Barrios , son of a village alcalde , general of division , commanding in chief the Occidental Military district , did not frequent the higher society of the town . He preferred the unceremonious gatherings of men where he could tell jaguar - hunt stories , boast of his powers with the lasso , with which he could perform extremely difficult feats of the sort "
57178	57449	57093	57101	that bald - headed embustero with the dyed moustaches	1858	" as the saying goes amongst the llaneros ; relate tales of extraordinary night rides , encounters with wild bulls , struggles with crocodiles , adventures in the great forests , crossings of swollen rivers . And it was not mere boastfulness that prompted the general 's reminiscences , but a genuine love of that wild life which he had led in his young days before he turned his back for ever on the thatched roof of the parental tolderia in the woods . Wandering away as far as Mexico he had fought against the French by the side as he said of Juarez , and was the only military man of Costaguana who had ever encountered European troops in the field . That fact shed a great lustre upon his name till it became eclipsed by the rising star of Montero . All his life he had been an inveterate gambler . He alluded himself quite openly to the current story how once , during some campaign when in command of a brigade , he had gambled away his horses , pistols , and accoutrements , to the very epaulettes , playing monte with his colonels the night before the battle . Finally , he had sent under escort his sword a presentation sword , with a gold hilt to the town in the rear of his position to be immediately pledged for five hundred pesetas with a sleepy and frightened shop - keeper . By daybreak he had lost the last of that money , too , when his only remark , as he rose calmly , was , "
57460	57487	57093	57101	that bald - headed embustero with the dyed moustaches	1858	" From that time he had become aware that a general could lead his troops into battle very well with a simple stick in his hand . "
57496	57635	57093	57101	that bald - headed embustero with the dyed moustaches	1858	" he would say . He was always overwhelmed with debts ; even during the periods of splendour in his varied fortunes of a Costaguana general , when he held high military commands , his gold - laced uniforms were almost always in pawn with some tradesman . And at last , to avoid the incessant difficulties of costume caused by the anxious lenders , he had assumed a disdain of military trappings , an eccentric fashion of shabby old tunics , which had become like a second nature . But the faction Barrios joined needed to fear no political betrayal . He was too much of a real soldier for the ignoble traffic of buying and selling victories . A member of the foreign diplomatic body in Sta . Marta had once passed a judgment upon him : "
57657	57727	57651	57655	mais il manque de tenue	1862	" After the triumph of the Ribierists he had obtained the reputedly lucrative Occidental command , mainly through the exertions of his creditors the Sta . Marta shopkeepers , all great politicians , who moved heaven and earth in his interest publicly , and privately besieged Senor Moraga , the influential agent of the San Tome mine , with the exaggerated lamentations that if the general were passed over , "
57734	58116	57651	57655	mais il manque de tenue	1862	" An incidental but favourable mention of his name in Mr. Gould senior 's long correspondence with his son had something to do with his appointment , too ; but most of all undoubtedly his established political honesty . No one questioned the personal bravery of the Tiger - killer , as the populace called him . He was , however , said to be unlucky in the field - but this was to be the beginning of an era of peace . The soldiers liked him for his humane temper , which was like a strange and precious flower unexpectedly blooming on the hotbed of corrupt revolutions ; and when he rode slowly through the streets during some military display , the contemptuous good humour of his solitary eye roaming over the crowds extorted the acclamations of the populace . The women of that class especially seemed positively fascinated by the long drooping nose , the peaked chin , the heavy lower lip , the black silk eyepatch and band slanting rakishly over the forehead . His high rank always procured an audience of Caballeros for his sporting stories , which he detailed very well with a simple , grave enjoyment . As to the society of ladies , it was irksome by the restraints it imposed without any equivalent , as far as he could see . He had not , perhaps , spoken three times on the whole to Mrs. Gould since he had taken up his high command ; but he had observed her frequently riding with the Senor Administrador , and had pronounced that there was more sense in her little bridle - hand than in all the female heads in Sulaco . His impulse had been to be very civil on parting to a woman who did not wobble in the saddle , and happened to be the wife of a personality very important to a man always short of money . He even pushed his attentions so far as to desire the aide - de - camp at his side a thick - set , short captain with a Tartar physiognomy to bring along a corporal with a file of men in front of the carriage , lest the crowd in its backward surges should "
58124	58146	57651	57655	mais il manque de tenue	1862	" Then , turning to the small knot of silent Europeans looking on within earshot , he raised his voice protectingly - "
58237	58267	58271	58272	Don Jose	247	" The little group of engineers received this exhortation without a word , and after waving his hand at them loftily , he addressed himself again to Mrs. Gould - "
58339	58699	58700	58700	I	0	" But a young officer in a very new uniform , hurrying up from the direction of the jetty , interrupted his interpretation of Senor Avellanos 's ideals . The general made a movement of impatience ; the other went on talking to him insistently , with an air of respect . The horses of the Staff had been embarked , the steamer 's gig was awaiting the general at the boat steps ; and Barrios , after a fierce stare of his one eye , began to take leave . Don Jose roused himself for an appropriate phrase pronounced mechanically . The terrible strain of hope and fear was telling on him , and he seemed to husband the last sparks of his fire for those oratorical efforts of which even the distant Europe was to hear . Antonia , her red lips firmly closed , averted her head behind the raised fan ; and young Decoud , though he felt the girl 's eyes upon him , gazed away persistently , hooked on his elbow , with a scornful and complete detachment . Mrs. Gould heroically concealed her dismay at the appearance of men and events so remote from her racial conventions , dismay too deep to be uttered in words even to her husband . She understood his voiceless reserve better now . Their confidential intercourse fell , not in moments of privacy , but precisely in public , when the quick meeting of their glances would comment upon some fresh turn of events . She had gone to his school of uncompromising silence , the only one possible , since so much that seemed shocking , weird , and grotesque in the working out of their purposes had to be accepted as normal in this country . Decidedly , the stately Antonia looked more mature and infinitely calm ; but she would never have known how to reconcile the sudden sinkings of her heart with an amiable mobility of expression . Mrs. Gould smiled a good - bye at Barrios , nodded round to the Europeans who raised their hats simultaneously with an engaging invitation , "
58710	58718	58843	58843	Ignacio	374	" ; then said nervously to Decoud , "
58725	58742	58722	58723	Don Martin	257	" and heard him mutter to himself in French , as he opened the carriage door , "
58749	58838	58722	58723	Don Martin	257	" She heard him with a sort of exasperation . Nobody ought to have known better than himself that the first cast of dice had been already thrown long ago in a most desperate game . Distant acclamations , words of command yelled out , and a roll of drums on the jetty greeted the departing general . Something like a slight faintness came over her , and she looked blankly at Antonia 's still face , wondering what would happen to Charley if that absurd man failed . "
58845	58871	58843	58843	Ignacio	374	" she cried at the motionless broad back of the coachman , who gathered the reins without haste , mumbling to himself under his breath , "
58882	59183	58843	58843	Ignacio	374	" The carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft track , the shadows fell long on the dusty little plain interspersed with dark bushes , mounds of turned - up earth , low wooden buildings with iron roofs of the Railway Company ; the sparse row of telegraph poles strode obliquely clear of the town , bearing a single , almost invisible wire far into the great campo - like a slender , vibrating feeler of that progress waiting outside for a moment of peace to enter and twine itself about the weary heart of the land . The cafe window of the Albergo d'ltalia Una was full of sunburnt , whiskered faces of railway men . But at the other end of the house , the end of the Signori Inglesi , old Giorgio , at the door with one of his girls on each side , bared his bushy head , as white as the snows of Higuerota . Mrs. Gould stopped the carriage . She seldom failed to speak to her protege ; moreover , the excitement , the heat , and the dust had made her thirsty . She asked for a glass of water . Giorgio sent the children indoors for it , and approached with pleasure expressed in his whole rugged countenance . It was not often that he had occasion to see his benefactress , who was also an Englishwoman - another title to his regard . He offered some excuses for his wife . It was a bad day with her ; her oppressions - he tapped his own broad chest . She could not move from her chair that day . Decoud , ensconced in the corner of his seat , observed gloomily Mrs. Gould 's old revolutionist , then , offhand - "
59197	59269	59189	59189	you	1879	" Old Giorgio , looking at him with some curiosity , said civilly that the troops had marched very well . One - eyed Barrios and his officers had done wonders with the recruits in a short time . Those Indios , only caught the other day , had gone swinging past in double quick time , like bersaglieri ; they looked well fed , too , and had whole uniforms . "
59272	59347	59189	59189	you	1879	" he repeated with a half - smile of pity . A look of grim retrospect stole over his piercing , steady eyes . It had been otherwise in his time when men fought against tyranny , in the forests of Brazil , or on the plains of Uruguay , starving on half - raw beef without salt , half naked , with often only a knife tied to a stick for a weapon . "
59358	59411	59437	59440	a man of experience	1882	" he concluded , proudly . His animation fell ; the slight gesture of his hand expressed discouragement ; but he added that he had asked one of the sergeants to show him the new rifle . There was no such weapon in his fighting days ; and if Barrios could not - "
59416	59427	59437	59440	a man of experience	1882	" broke in Don Jose , almost trembling with eagerness . "
59461	59472	59459	59459	Martin	257	" Decoud , lolling back moodily , contemplated old Viola . "
59494	59530	59491	59491	your	386	" Mrs. Gould leaned over to the children . Linda had brought out a glass of water on a tray , with extreme care ; Giselle presented her with a bunch of flowers gathered hastily . "
59535	59542	59491	59491	your	386	" declared old Viola , sternly . "
59554	59555	59491	59491	your	386	" "
59558	59565	59491	59491	your	386	" muttered old Viola , savagely . "
59577	59642	59568	59568	they	605	" At that moment young Scarfe of the railway staff emerged from the door of the part reserved for the Signori Inglesi . He had come down to headquarters from somewhere up the line on a light engine , and had had just time to get a bath and change his clothes . He was a nice boy , and Mrs. Gould welcomed him . "
59697	59698	59699	59701	The young patricians	1887	" "
59703	59712	59699	59701	The young patricians	1887	" Decoud began suddenly in his precise English , "
59729	59736	59725	59727	the Great Pompey	390	" Young Scarfe stared , astounded . "
59743	59748	59749	59750	Mr. Decoud	392	" Mrs. Gould intervened . "
59755	59756	59752	59753	Mr. Scarfe	393	" "
59767	59780	59781	59781	You	386	" protested Don Jose , with nervous haste , also in English . "
59790	59811	59788	59788	Martin	257	" Antonia 's breast rose and fell with a deeper breath . The young engineer was utterly in the dark . "
59815	59821	59788	59788	Martin	257	" he muttered , vaguely . "
59830	59834	59827	59828	a Caesar	6435	" Decoud continued . "
59850	59871	59827	59828	a Caesar	6435	" He crossed his arms on his breast , looking at Senor Avellanos , who had returned to his immobility . "
59894	59978	59882	59885	a genuine old Roman	1891	" Since he had heard the name of Montero pronounced , young Scarfe had been eager to express his simple feelings . In a loud and youthful tone he hoped that this Montero was going to be licked once for all and done with . There was no saying what would happen to the railway if the revolution got the upper hand . Perhaps it would have to be abandoned . It would not be the first railway gone to pot in Costaguana . "
59993	60049	60088	60089	Mrs. Gould	248	" he ran on , wrinkling up his nose as if the word had a suspicious flavour to his profound experience of South American affairs . And , of course , he chatted with animation , it had been such an immense piece of luck for him at his age to get appointed on the staff "
60062	60081	60088	60089	Mrs. Gould	248	" It would give him the pull over a lot of chaps all through life , he asserted . "
60091	60113	60088	60089	Mrs. Gould	248	" His artless grin disappeared slowly before the unanimous gravity of the faces turned upon him from the carriage ; only that "
60117	60208	60088	60089	Mrs. Gould	248	" Don Jose , presenting a motionless , waxy profile , stared straight on as if deaf . Scarfe did not know the Avellanos very well . They did not give balls , and Antonia never appeared at a ground - floor window , as some other young ladies used to do attended by elder women , to chat with the caballeros on horseback in the Calle . The stares of these creoles did not matter much ; but what on earth had come to Mrs. Gould ? She said , "
60214	60264	60212	60212	Ignacio	374	" and gave him a slow inclination of the head . He heard a short laugh from that round - faced , Frenchified fellow . He coloured up to the eyes , and stared at Giorgio Viola , who had fallen back with the children , hat in hand . "
60272	60283	60265	60265	I	0	" he said with some asperity to the old man . "
60294	60351	60212	60212	Ignacio	374	" murmured the Garibaldino , smoothing absently , with his brown hands , the two heads , one dark with bronze glints , the other fair with a coppery ripple , of the two girls by his side . The returning stream of sightseers raised a great dust on the road . Horsemen noticed the group . "
60357	60361	60362	60362	They	1896	" he said . "
60377	60453	60375	60375	nobody	976	" He looked at the young engineer and stopped , as if awakened from a dream ; then , folding his arms on his breast , took up his usual position , leaning back in the doorway with an upward glance fastened on the white shoulder of Higuerota far away . In the carriage Martin Decoud , shifting his position as though he could not make himself comfortable , muttered as he swayed towards Antonia , "
60460	60489	60456	60456	you	1894	" Then in a loud voice he began to congratulate Don Jose upon all the engineers being convinced Ribierists . The interest of all those foreigners was gratifying . "
60522	60523	60524	60524	He	1898	" "
60529	60536	60524	60524	He	1898	" Mrs. Gould remarked , quietly . "
60545	60549	60524	60524	He	1898	" retorted Decoud . "
60755	61373	60742	60746	an ignorant , boastful Indio	1919	" But Don Jose , disregarding the general indictment as though he had not heard a word of it , took up the defence of Barrios . The man was competent enough for his special task in the plan of campaign . It consisted in an offensive movement , with Cayta as base , upon the flank of the Revolutionist forces advancing from the south against Sta . Marta , which was covered by another army with the President - Dictator in its midst . Don Jose became quite animated with a great flow of speech , bending forward anxiously under the steady eyes of his daughter . Decoud , as if silenced by so much ardour , did not make a sound . The bells of the city were striking the hour of Oracion when the carriage rolled under the old gateway facing the harbour like a shapeless monument of leaves and stones . The rumble of wheels under the sonorous arch was traversed by a strange , piercing shriek , and Decoud , from his back seat , had a view of the people behind the carriage trudging along the road outside , all turning their heads , in sombreros and rebozos , to look at a locomotive which rolled quickly out of sight behind Giorgio Viola 's house , under a white trail of steam that seemed to vanish in the breathless , hysterically prolonged scream of warlike triumph . And it was all like a fleeting vision , the shrieking ghost of a railway engine fleeing across the frame of the archway , behind the startled movement of the people streaming back from a military spectacle with silent footsteps on the dust of the road . It was a material train returning from the Campo to the palisaded yards . The empty cars rolled lightly on the single track ; there was no rumble of wheels , no tremor of the ground . The engine - driver , running past the Casa Viola with the salute of an uplifted arm , checked his speed smartly before entering the yard ; and when the ear - splitting screech of the steam - whistle for the brakes had stopped , a series of hard , battering shocks , mingled with the clanking of chain - couplings , made a tumult of blows and shaken fetters under the vault of the gate . CHAPTER FIVE The Gould carriage was the first to return from the harbour to the empty town . On the ancient pavement , laid out in patterns , sunk into ruts and holes , the portly Ignacio , mindful of the springs of the Parisian - built landau , had pulled up to a walk , and Decoud in his corner contemplated moodily the inner aspect of the gate . The squat turreted sides held up between them a mass of masonry with bunches of grass growing at the top , and a grey , heavily scrolled , armorial shield of stone above the apex of the arch with the arms of Spain nearly smoothed out as if in readiness for some new device typical of the impending progress . The explosive noise of the railway trucks seemed to augment Decoud 's irritation . He muttered something to himself , then began to talk aloud in curt , angry phrases thrown at the silence of the two women . They did not look at him at all ; while Don Jose , with his semi - translucent , waxy complexion , overshadowed by the soft grey hat , swayed a little to the jolts of the carriage by the side of Mrs. Gould . "
61386	61437	60742	60746	an ignorant , boastful Indio	1919	" Decoud spoke in French , perhaps because of Ignacio on the box above him ; the old coachman , with his broad back filling a short , silver - braided jacket , had a big pair of ears , whose thick rims stood well away from his cropped head . "
61455	61474	61483	61483	morions	1923	" He ruminated his discontent for a while , then began afresh with a sidelong glance at Antonia - "
61546	61547	61538	61541	that absurd sailor Mitchell	1931	" "
61560	61565	61548	61548	Mitchell	267	" exclaimed Don Jose . "
61759	61765	61802	61802	Emilia	294	" - he did not say "
61768	61776	61802	61802	Emilia	294	" but added , after a pause - "
61779	61784	61802	61802	Emilia	294	" Mrs. Gould said , "
61791	61796	61802	61802	Emilia	294	" And Antonia interjected , "
61809	61810	61804	61804	He	1946	" "
61822	61894	61811	61811	You	1947	" Decoud answered . And then the carriage stopped before the door of the Casa Gould . The young man offered his hand to the ladies . They went in first together ; Don Jose walked by the side of Decoud , and the gouty old porter tottered after them with some light wraps on his arm . Don Jose slipped his hand under the arm of the journalist of Sulaco . "
61944	61948	61926	61926	We	1950	" Decoud muttered , "
61962	62029	61926	61926	We	1950	" The long open gallery was in shadow , with its screen of plants in vases along the balustrade , holding out motionless blossoms , and all the glass doors of the reception - rooms thrown open . A jingle of spurs died out at the further end . Basilio , standing aside against the wall , said in a soft tone to the passing ladies , "
62040	62242	62030	62032	The Senor Administrador	1589	" In the great sala , with its groups of ancient Spanish and modern European furniture making as if different centres under the high white spread of the ceiling , the silver and porcelain of the tea - service gleamed among a cluster of dwarf chairs , like a bit of a lady 's boudoir , putting in a note of feminine and intimate delicacy . Don Jose in his rocking - chair placed his hat on his lap , and Decoud walked up and down the whole length of the room , passing between tables loaded with knick - knacks and almost disappearing behind the high backs of leathern sofas . He was thinking of the angry face of Antonia ; he was confident that he would make his peace with her . He had not stayed in Sulaco to quarrel with Antonia . Martin Decoud was angry with himself . All he saw and heard going on around him exasperated the preconceived views of his European civilization . To contemplate revolutions from the distance of the Parisian Boulevards was quite another matter . Here on the spot it was not possible to dismiss their tragic comedy with the expression , "
62246	62287	62288	62288	I	0	" The reality of the political action , such as it was , seemed closer , and acquired poignancy by Antonia 's belief in the cause . Its crudeness hurt his feelings . He was surprised at his own sensitiveness . "
62303	62478	62288	62288	I	0	" he thought to himself . His disdain grew like a reaction of his scepticism against the action into which he was forced by his infatuation for Antonia . He soothed himself by saying he was not a patriot , but a lover . The ladies came in bareheaded , and Mrs. Gould sank low before the little tea - table . Antonia took up her usual place at the reception hour - the corner of a leathern couch , with a rigid grace in her pose and a fan in her hand . Decoud , swerving from the straight line of his march , came to lean over the high back of her seat . For a long time he talked into her ear from behind , softly , with a half smile and an air of apologetic familiarity . Her fan lay half grasped on her knees . She never looked at him . His rapid utterance grew more and more insistent and caressing . At last he ventured a slight laugh . "
62494	62520	62521	62521	You	1957	" He paused . She turned her head a little ; her blue eyes glided slowly towards him , slightly upwards , mollified and questioning . "
62569	62578	62582	62582	you	1957	" Her hand closed firmly on her fan . "
62651	62665	62648	62649	a patriot	1461	" She opened her red lips for the first time , not unkindly . "
62699	62700	62696	62697	Don Martin	257	" "
62718	62747	62748	62748	Antonia	256	" He spoke lightly , and paused . She began to fan herself with a slow movement without raising her hand . After a time he whispered passionately - "
62750	62792	62793	62793	Bonjour	399	" She smiled , and extended her hand after the English manner towards Charles Gould , who was bowing before her ; while Decoud , with his elbows spread on the back of the sofa , dropped his eyes and murmured , "
62795	62824	62793	62793	Bonjour	399	" The Senor Administrador of the San Tome mine bent over his wife for a moment . They exchanged a few words , of which only the phrase , "
62829	62839	62793	62793	Bonjour	399	" pronounced by Mrs. Gould , could be heard . "
62842	62849	62851	62851	he	1962	" Decoud began in a murmur . "
62853	62854	62851	62851	he	1962	" "
62860	62868	62869	62869	You	256	" said Antonia , not very severely . "
62887	63449	62869	62869	You	256	" Decoud whispered . Don Jose had raised his voice . He rubbed his hands cheerily . The excellent aspect of the troops and the great quantity of new deadly rifles on the shoulders of those brave men seemed to fill him with an ecstatic confidence . Charles Gould , very tall and thin before his chair , listened , but nothing could be discovered in his face except a kind and deferential attention . Meantime , Antonia had risen , and , crossing the room , stood looking out of one of the three long windows giving on the street . Decoud followed her . The window was thrown open , and he leaned against the thickness of the wall . The long folds of the damask curtain , falling straight from the broad brass cornice , hid him partly from the room . He folded his arms on his breast , and looked steadily at Antonia 's profile . The people returning from the harbour filled the pavements ; the shuffle of sandals and a low murmur of voices ascended to the window . Now and then a coach rolled slowly along the disjointed roadway of the Calle de la Constitucion . There were not many private carriages in Sulaco ; at the most crowded hour on the Alameda they could be counted with one glance of the eye . The great family arks swayed on high leathern springs , full of pretty powdered faces in which the eyes looked intensely alive and black . And first Don Juste Lopez , the President of the Provincial Assembly , passed with his three lovely daughters , solemn in a black frock - coat and stiff white tie , as when directing a debate from a high tribune . Though they all raised their eyes , Antonia did not make the usual greeting gesture of a fluttered hand , and they affected not to see the two young people , Costaguaneros with European manners , whose eccentricities were discussed behind the barred windows of the first families in Sulaco . And then the widowed Senora Gavilaso de Valdes rolled by , handsome and dignified , in a great machine in which she used to travel to and from her country house , surrounded by an armed retinue in leather suits and big sombreros , with carbines at the bows of their saddles . She was a woman of most distinguished family , proud , rich , and kind - hearted . Her second son , Jaime , had just gone off on the Staff of Barrios . The eldest , a worthless fellow of a moody disposition , filled Sulaco with the noise of his dissipations , and gambled heavily at the club . The two youngest boys , with yellow Ribierist cockades in their caps , sat on the front seat . She , too , affected not to see the Senor Decoud talking publicly with Antonia in defiance of every convention . And he not even her novio as far as the world knew ! Though , even in that case , it would have been scandal enough . But the dignified old lady , respected and admired by the first families , would have been still more shocked if she could have heard the words they were exchanging . "
63469	63506	63460	63460	I	0	" She made an almost imperceptible negative movement of her head , still staring across the street at the Avellanos 's house , grey , marked with decay , and with iron bars like a prison . "
63516	63520	63578	63581	a very terrible person	1965	" he continued , "
63555	63573	63543	63543	you	1963	" A slight smile seemed to move the corner of the lip that was on his side . "
63610	63615	63600	63600	you	0	" She interrupted him . "
63623	63624	63616	63616	You	0	" "
63629	63642	63643	63643	you	1963	" he said , changing suddenly to a tone of bitter levity , "
63654	63655	63643	63643	you	1963	" "
63661	63669	63643	63643	you	1963	" she murmured in a shocked tone . "
63672	63678	63679	63679	you	1963	" he argued , mockingly , "
63706	63717	63702	63702	you	1963	" he continued , his tone passing into light banter , "
63784	63785	63787	63787	he	304	" "
63791	63797	63798	63798	You	1963	" said Antonia , thoughtfully . "
63810	63819	63798	63798	You	1963	" Decoud replied , with a broad smile . "
64103	64143	64088	64088	you	1963	" His tone remained light , and as if unaware of his presence she stood motionless , her hands clasped lightly , the fan hanging down from her interlaced fingers . He waited for a while , and then - "
64151	64224	64225	64225	Martin	404	" he said , with a sort of jocular desperation . Even that declaration did not make her look at him . Her head remained still , her eyes fixed upon the house of the Avellanos , whose chipped pilasters , broken cornices , the whole degradation of dignity was hidden now by the gathering dusk of the street . In her whole figure her lips alone moved , forming the words - "
64233	64362	64227	64227	you	404	" He remained silent for a minute , startled , as if overwhelmed by a sort of awed happiness , with the lines of the mocking smile still stiffened about his mouth , and incredulous surprise in his eyes . The value of a sentence is in the personality which utters it , for nothing new can be said by man or woman ; and those were the last words , it seemed to him , that could ever have been spoken by Antonia . He had never made it up with her so completely in all their intercourse of small encounters ; but even before she had time to turn towards him , which she did slowly with a rigid grace , he had begun to plead - "
64447	64448	64413	64414	a fool	2002	" "
64460	64461	64457	64457	He	407	" "
64471	64477	64462	64462	I	0	" he began , hurriedly . "
64569	64570	64571	64572	The man	543	" "
64574	64587	64571	64572	The man	543	" she said , thoughtfully , and very calm before this outburst , "
64617	64618	64611	64612	his brother	6096	" "
64623	64627	64611	64612	his brother	6096	" he said . "
64823	64830	64807	64807	I	0	" She shook her head slightly . "
64835	64839	64840	64840	He	543	" she murmured . "
64848	65225	65226	65226	We	2020	" She was facing him now in the deep recess of the window , very close and motionless . Her lips moved rapidly . Decoud , leaning his back against the wall , listened with crossed arms and lowered eyelids . He drank the tones of her even voice , and watched the agitated life of her throat , as if waves of emotion had run from her heart to pass out into the air in her reasonable words . He also had his aspirations , he aspired to carry her away out of these deadly futilities of pronunciamientos and reforms . All this was wrong - utterly wrong ; but she fascinated him , and sometimes the sheer sagacity of a phrase would break the charm , replace the fascination by a sudden unwilling thrill of interest . Some women hovered , as it were , on the threshold of genius , he reflected . They did not want to know , or think , or understand . Passion stood for all that , and he was ready to believe that some startlingly profound remark , some appreciation of character , or a judgment upon an event , bordered on the miraculous . In the mature Antonia he could see with an extraordinary vividness the austere schoolgirl of the earlier days . She seduced his attention ; sometimes he could not restrain a murmur of assent ; now and then he advanced an objection quite seriously . Gradually they began to argue ; the curtain half hid them from the people in the sala . Outside it had grown dark . From the deep trench of shadow between the houses , lit up vaguely by the glimmer of street lamps , ascended the evening silence of Sulaco ; the silence of a town with few carriages , of unshod horses , and a softly sandalled population . The windows of the Casa Gould flung their shining parallelograms upon the house of the Avellanos . Now and then a shuffle of feet passed below with the pulsating red glow of a cigarette at the foot of the walls ; and the night air , as if cooled by the snows of Higuerota , refreshed their faces . "
65229	65246	65226	65226	We	2020	" said Martin Decoud , using the usual term the provincials of Sulaco applied to themselves , "
65431	65444	65491	65491	I	0	" She made an energetic gesture of negation . A silence fell . "
65502	65535	65491	65491	I	0	" She shook her head . No , she was not startled , but the idea shocked her early convictions . Her patriotism was larger . She had never considered that possibility . "
65549	65707	65491	65491	I	0	" he said , prophetically . She did not answer . She seemed tired . They leaned side by side on the rail of the little balcony , very friendly , having exhausted politics , giving themselves up to the silent feeling of their nearness , in one of those profound pauses that fall upon the rhythm of passion . Towards the plaza end of the street the glowing coals in the brazeros of the market women cooking their evening meal gleamed red along the edge of the pavement . A man appeared without a sound in the light of a street lamp , showing the coloured inverted triangle of his bordered poncho , square on his shoulders , hanging to a point below his knees . From the harbour end of the Calle a horseman walked his soft - stepping mount , gleaming silver - grey abreast each lamp under the dark shape of the rider . "
65715	65721	65725	65725	his	2035	" said Decoud , gently , "
65759	65760	65745	65745	he	2035	" "
65765	65769	65745	65745	he	2035	" said Antonia . "
65776	65777	65778	65779	A journalist	530	" "
65819	65820	65816	65816	his	936	" "
65825	65831	65816	65816	his	936	" said Antonia , thoughtfully . "
65843	66092	65836	65837	this Italian	2047	" The horseman had passed below them , with a gleam of dim light on the shining broad quarters of the grey mare , on a bright heavy stirrup , on a long silver spur ; but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was powerless against the muffled - up mysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great sombrero . Decoud and Antonia remained leaning over the balcony , side by side , touching elbows , with their heads overhanging the darkness of the street , and the brilliantly lighted sala at their backs . This was a tete - a - tete of extreme impropriety ; something of which in the whole extent of the Republic only the extraordinary Antonia could be capable - the poor , motherless girl , never accompanied , with a careless father , who had thought only of making her learned . Even Decoud himself seemed to feel that this was as much as he could expect of having her to himself till - till the revolution was over and he could carry her off to Europe , away from the endlessness of civil strife , whose folly seemed even harder to bear than its ignominy . After one Montero there would be another , the lawlessness of a populace of all colours and races , barbarism , irremediable tyranny . As the great Liberator Bolivar had said in the bitterness of his spirit , "
66108	66307	66097	66102	Those who worked for her independence	2048	" He did not care , he declared boldly ; he seized every opportunity to tell her that though she had managed to make a Blanco journalist of him , he was no patriot . First of all , the word had no sense for cultured minds , to whom the narrowness of every belief is odious ; and secondly , in connection with the everlasting troubles of this unhappy country it was hopelessly besmirched ; it had been the cry of dark barbarism , the cloak of lawlessness , of crimes , of rapacity , of simple thieving . He was surprised at the warmth of his own utterance . He had no need to drop his voice ; it had been low all the time , a mere murmur in the silence of dark houses with their shutters closed early against the night air , as is the custom of Sulaco . Only the sala of the Casa Gould flung out defiantly the blaze of its four windows , the bright appeal of light in the whole dumb obscurity of the street . And the murmur on the little balcony went on after a short pause . "
66317	66321	66309	66309	we	2050	" Antonia protested . "
66364	66365	66360	66360	Papa	407	" "
66370	66388	66360	66360	Papa	407	" interrupted Decoud , looking down . There was below the sound of hasty and ponderous footsteps . "
66407	66411	66412	66412	He	2053	" observed Decoud . "
66761	66835	66747	66747	He	2053	" Antonia listened with her hands over the balustrade , opening and shutting the fan gently ; and Decoud talked a little nervously , as if afraid that she would leave him at the first pause . Their comparative isolation , the precious sense of intimacy , the slight contact of their arms , affected him softly ; for now and then a tender inflection crept into the flow of his ironic murmurs . "
67207	67216	67204	67205	a lover	7438	" He paused , then muttered almost inaudibly , "
67226	67407	67204	67205	a lover	7438	" Behind their backs the political tide that once in every twenty - four hours set with a strong flood through the Gould drawing - room could be heard , rising higher in a hum of voices . Men had been dropping in singly , or in twos and threes : the higher officials of the province , engineers of the railway , sunburnt and in tweeds , with the frosted head of their chief smiling with slow , humorous indulgence amongst the young eager faces . Scarfe , the lover of fandangos , had already slipped out in search of some dance , no matter where , on the outskirts of the town . Don Juste Lopez , after taking his daughters home , had entered solemnly , in a black creased coat buttoned up under his spreading brown beard . The few members of the Provincial Assembly present clustered at once around their President to discuss the news of the war and the last proclamation of the rebel Montero , the miserable Montero , calling in the name of "
67412	67492	67493	67493	Sulaco	408	" upon all the Provincial Assemblies of the Republic to suspend their sittings till his sword had made peace and the will of the people could be consulted . It was practically an invitation to dissolve : an unheard - of audacity of that evil madman . The indignation ran high in the knot of deputies behind Jose Avellanos . Don Jose , lifting up his voice , cried out to them over the high back of his chair , "
67522	67693	67493	67493	Sulaco	408	" A great outburst of acclamations covered the vibrating treble of the life and soul of the party . Yes ! Yes ! This was true ! A great truth ! Sulaco was in the forefront , as ever ! It was a boastful tumult , the hopefulness inspired by the event of the day breaking out amongst those caballeros of the Campo thinking of their herds , of their lands , of the safety of their families . Everything was at stake . . . . No ! It was impossible that Montero should succeed ! This criminal , this shameless Indio ! The clamour continued for some time , everybody else in the room looking towards the group where Don Juste had put on his air of impartial solemnity as if presiding at a sitting of the Provincial Assembly . Decoud had turned round at the noise , and , leaning his back on the balustrade , shouted into the room with all the strength of his lungs , "
67698	67744	67493	67493	Sulaco	408	" This unexpected cry had the effect of stilling the noise . All the eyes were directed to the window with an approving expectation ; but Decoud had already turned his back upon the room , and was again leaning out over the quiet street . "
67759	67765	67766	67766	I	0	" he said to Antonia . "
67934	67935	67943	67944	Don Martin	257	" "
67946	67950	67943	67944	Don Martin	257	" interrupted Antonia . "
67961	67967	67955	67959	a man of that sort	1442	" said Decoud , curtly . "
67985	68380	67982	67982	he	1442	" Decoud had often felt his familiar habit of ironic thought fall shattered against Antonia 's gravity . She irritated him as if she , too , had suffered from that inexplicable feminine obtuseness which stands so often between a man and a woman of the more ordinary sort . But he overcame his vexation at once . He was very far from thinking Antonia ordinary , whatever verdict his scepticism might have pronounced upon himself . With a touch of penetrating tenderness in his voice he assured her that his only aspiration was to a felicity so high that it seemed almost unrealizable on this earth . She coloured invisibly , with a warmth against which the breeze from the sierra seemed to have lost its cooling power in the sudden melting of the snows . His whisper could not have carried so far , though there was enough ardour in his tone to melt a heart of ice . Antonia turned away abruptly , as if to carry his whispered assurance into the room behind , full of light , noisy with voices . The tide of political speculation was beating high within the four walls of the great sala , as if driven beyond the marks by a great gust of hope . Don Juste 's fan - shaped beard was still the centre of loud and animated discussions . There was a self - confident ring in all the voices . Even the few Europeans around Charles Gould - a Dane , a couple of Frenchmen , a discreet fat German , smiling , with down - cast eyes , the representatives of those material interests that had got a footing in Sulaco under the protecting might of the San Tome mine - had infused a lot of good humour into their deference . Charles Gould , to whom they were paying their court , was the visible sign of the stability that could be achieved on the shifting ground of revolutions . They felt hopeful about their various undertakings . One of the two Frenchmen , small , black , with glittering eyes lost in an immense growth of bushy beard , waved his tiny brown hands and delicate wrists . He had been travelling in the interior of the province for a syndicate of European capitalists . His forcible "
68383	68526	67982	67982	he	1442	" returning every minute shrilled above the steady hum of conversations . He was relating his discoveries . He was ecstatic . Charles Gould glanced down at him courteously . At a given moment of these necessary receptions it was Mrs. Gould 's habit to withdraw quietly into a little drawing - room , especially her own , next to the great sala . She had risen , and , waiting for Antonia , listened with a slightly worried graciousness to the engineer - in - chief of the railway , who stooped over her , relating slowly , without the slightest gesture , something apparently amusing , for his eyes had a humorous twinkle . Antonia , before she advanced into the room to join Mrs. Gould , turned her head over her shoulder towards Decoud , only for a moment . "
68538	68544	68529	68532	any one of us	2135	" she said , rapidly . "
68558	68857	68556	68556	Antonia	256	" he answered , through clenched teeth , then bowed very low , a little distantly . The engineer - in - chief had not finished telling his amusing story . The humours of railway building in South America appealed to his keen appreciation of the absurd , and he told his instances of ignorant prejudice and as ignorant cunning very well . Now , Mrs. Gould gave him all her attention as he walked by her side escorting the ladies out of the room . Finally all three passed unnoticed through the glass doors in the gallery . Only a tall priest stalking silently in the noise of the sala checked himself to look after them . Father Corbelan , whom Decoud had seen from the balcony turning into the gateway of the Casa Gould , had addressed no one since coming in . The long , skimpy soutane accentuated the tallness of his stature ; he carried his powerful torso thrown forward ; and the straight , black bar of his joined eyebrows , the pugnacious outline of the bony face , the white spot of a scar on the bluish shaven cheeks a testimonial to his apostolic zeal from a party of unconverted Indians , suggested something unlawful behind his priesthood , the idea of a chaplain of bandits . He separated his bony , knotted hands clasped behind his back , to shake his finger at Martin . Decoud had stepped into the room after Antonia . But he did not go far . He had remained just within , against the curtain , with an expression of not quite genuine gravity , like a grown - up person taking part in a game of children . He gazed quietly at the threatening finger . "
68874	68884	68861	68861	your	2138	" he said , without making the slightest movement . "
68889	68910	68911	68912	The man	543	" Father Corbelan 's deep voice resounded all over the room , making all the heads turn on the shoulders . "
68928	69507	68919	68923	the God of your General	2142	" His contemptuous , arbitrary voice caused an uneasy suspension of every sound , as if the self - confidence of the gathering had been staggered by a blow . But nobody took up Father Corbelan 's declaration . It was known that Father Corbelan had come out of the wilds to advocate the sacred rights of the Church with the same fanatical fearlessness with which he had gone preaching to bloodthirsty savages , devoid of human compassion or worship of any kind . Rumours of legendary proportions told of his successes as a missionary beyond the eye of Christian men . He had baptized whole nations of Indians , living with them like a savage himself . It was related that the padre used to ride with his Indians for days , half naked , carrying a bullock - hide shield , and , no doubt , a long lance , too - who knows ? That he had wandered clothed in skins , seeking for proselytes somewhere near the snow line of the Cordillera . Of these exploits Padre Corbelan himself was never known to talk . But he made no secret of his opinion that the politicians of Sta . Marta had harder hearts and more corrupt minds than the heathen to whom he had carried the word of God . His injudicious zeal for the temporal welfare of the Church was damaging the Ribierist cause . It was common knowledge that he had refused to be made titular bishop of the Occidental diocese till justice was done to a despoiled Church . The political Gefe of Sulaco the same dignitary whom Captain Mitchell saved from the mob afterwards hinted with naive cynicism that doubtless their Excellencies the Ministers sent the padre over the mountains to Sulaco in the worst season of the year in the hope that he would be frozen to death by the icy blasts of the high paramos . Every year a few hardy muleteers - men inured to exposure - were known to perish in that way . But what would you have ? Their Excellencies possibly had not realized what a tough priest he was . Meantime , the ignorant were beginning to murmur that the Ribierist reforms meant simply the taking away of the land from the people . Some of it was to be given to foreigners who made the railway ; the greater part was to go to the padres . These were the results of the Grand Vicar 's zeal . Even from the short allocution to the troops on the Plaza which only the first ranks could have heard he had not been able to keep out his fixed idea of an outraged Church waiting for reparation from a penitent country . The political Gefe had been exasperated . But he could not very well throw the brother - in - law of Don Jose into the prison of the Cabildo . The chief magistrate , an easy - going and popular official , visited the Casa Gould , walking over after sunset from the Intendencia , unattended , acknowledging with dignified courtesy the salutations of high and low alike . That evening he had walked up straight to Charles Gould and had hissed out to him that he would have liked to deport the Grand Vicar out of Sulaco , anywhere , to some desert island , to the Isabels , for instance . "
69519	69951	68919	68923	the God of your General	2142	" he had added in a tone between jest and earnest . This uncontrollable priest , who had rejected his offer of the episcopal palace for a residence and preferred to hang his shabby hammock amongst the rubble and spiders of the sequestrated Dominican Convent , had taken into his head to advocate an unconditional pardon for Hernandez the Robber ! And this was not enough ; he seemed to have entered into communication with the most audacious criminal the country had known for years . The Sulaco police knew , of course , what was going on . Padre Corbelan had got hold of that reckless Italian , the Capataz de Cargadores , the only man fit for such an errand , and had sent a message through him . Father Corbelan had studied in Rome , and could speak Italian . The Capataz was known to visit the old Dominican Convent at night . An old woman who served the Grand Vicar had heard the name of Hernandez pronounced ; and only last Saturday afternoon the Capataz had been observed galloping out of town . He did not return for two days . The police would have laid the Italian by the heels if it had not been for fear of the Cargadores , a turbulent body of men , quite apt to raise a tumult . Nowadays it was not so easy to govern Sulaco . Bad characters flocked into it , attracted by the money in the pockets of the railway workmen . The populace was made restless by Father Corbelan 's discourses . And the first magistrate explained to Charles Gould that now the province was stripped of troops any outbreak of lawlessness would find the authorities with their boots off , as it were . Then he went away moodily to sit in an armchair , smoking a long , thin cigar , not very far from Don Jose , with whom , bending over sideways , he exchanged a few words from time to time . He ignored the entrance of the priest , and whenever Father Corbelan 's voice was raised behind him , he shrugged his shoulders impatiently . Father Corbelan had remained quite motionless for a time with that something vengeful in his immobility which seemed to characterize all his attitudes . A lurid glow of strong convictions gave its peculiar aspect to the black figure . But its fierceness became softened as the padre , fixing his eyes upon Decoud , raised his long , black arm slowly , impressively - "
69961	70018	69955	69955	you	2144	" he said , in a subdued , deep voice . He made a step nearer , pointing a forefinger at the young man 's breast . Decoud , very calm , felt the wall behind the curtain with the back of his head . Then , with his chin tilted well up , he smiled . "
70022	70039	69955	69955	you	2144	" he agreed with the slightly weary nonchalance of a man well used to these passages . "
70067	70076	70077	70077	You	2144	" The priest suppressed a gesture of discouragement . "
70085	70089	70077	70077	You	2144	" he said . "
70093	70099	70077	70077	You	2144	" added Decoud without stirring . "
70141	70142	70138	70139	a heathen	2083	" "
70145	70150	70138	70139	a heathen	2083	" retorted the priest . "
70164	70165	70166	70166	I	0	" "
70174	70190	70166	70166	I	0	" said Decoud , quietly . Father Corbelan shrugged his high , broad shoulders doubtfully . "
70201	70216	70198	70199	a materialist	2154	" he pronounced slowly , as if weighing the terms of a careful analysis . "
70229	70235	70198	70199	a materialist	2154	" he continued , thoughtfully . "
70242	70265	70266	70271	The victim of this faithless age	2157	" Decoud commented under his breath , his head at rest against the wall , his eyes gazing up at the ceiling . "
70273	70284	70266	70271	The victim of this faithless age	2157	" Father Corbelan resumed in a deep but subdued voice . "
70293	70306	70290	70291	a journalist	530	" Decoud changed his pose and spoke in a more animated tone . "
70411	70546	70608	70610	C'est trop beau	2174	" The priest nodded and turned on the heels of his square - toed shoes with big steel buckles . Again , with his hands clasped behind his back , he paced to and fro , planting his feet firmly . When he swung about , the skirt of his soutane was inflated slightly by the brusqueness of his movements . The great sala had been emptying itself slowly . When the Gefe Politico rose to go , most of those still remaining stood up suddenly in sign of respect , and Don Jose Avellanos stopped the rocking of his chair . But the good - natured First Official made a deprecatory gesture , waved his hand to Charles Gould , and went out discreetly . In the comparative peace of the room the screaming "
70549	70573	70585	70585	Monsieur	2172	" of the frail , hairy Frenchman seemed to acquire a preternatural shrillness . The explorer of the Capitalist syndicate was still enthusiastic . "
70612	70665	70666	70667	Those gentlemen	2175	" He fell a prey to a screaming ecstasy , in the midst of sagely nodding heads , before Charles Gould 's imperturbable calm . And only the priest continued his pacing , flinging round the skirt of his soutane at each end of his beat . Decoud murmured to him ironically : "
70673	70785	70666	70667	Those gentlemen	2175	" Father Corbelan stopped short , looked at the journalist of Sulaco fixedly for a moment , shrugged his shoulders slightly , and resumed his plodding walk of an obstinate traveller . And now the Europeans were dropping off from the group around Charles Gould till the Administrador of the Great Silver Mine could be seen in his whole lank length , from head to foot , left stranded by the ebbing tide of his guests on the great square of carpet , as it were a multi - coloured shoal of flowers and arabesques under his brown boots . Father Corbelan approached the rocking - chair of Don Jose Avellanos . "
70790	70816	70788	70788	brother	2177	" he said , with kindly brusqueness and a touch of relieved impatience a man may feel at the end of a perfectly useless ceremony . "
70844	70899	70946	70947	Martin Decoud	257	" He rolled his black eyes upwards . By the side of the frail diplomatist - the life and soul of the party - he seemed gigantic , with a gleam of fanaticism in the glance . But the voice of the party , or , rather , its mouthpiece , the ' son Decoud "
70982	70999	71000	71000	Decoud	257	" It is like madness . It must be - because it 's self - destructive , "
71440	71444	71446	71449	the man from Esmeralda	2206	" We stopped , "
71451	71789	71446	71449	the man from Esmeralda	2206	" and I tried to hide behind a small bush . But none of my mozos would go forward to find out what it meant , and the third horseman seemed to be waiting for us to come up . It was no use . We had been seen . So we rode slowly on , trembling . He let us pass - a man on a grey horse with his hat down on his eyes - without a word of greeting ; but by - and - by we heard him galloping after us . We faced about , but that did not seem to intimidate him . He rode up at speed , and touching my foot with the toe of his boot , asked me for a cigar , with a blood - curdling laugh . He did not seem armed , but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist . I shuddered . He had very fierce whiskers , Don Carlos , and as he did not offer to go on we dared not move . At last , blowing the smoke of my cigar into the air through his nostrils , he said , ' Senor , it would be perhaps better for you if I rode behind your party . You are not very far from Sulaco now . Go you with God . ' What would you ? We went on . There was no resisting him . He might have been Hernandez himself ; though my servant , who has been many times to Sulaco by sea , assured me that he had recognized him very well for the Capataz of the Steamship Company 's Cargadores . Later , that same evening , I saw that very man at the corner of the Plaza talking to a girl , a Morenita , who stood by the stirrup with her hand on the grey horse 's mane . "
71790	71798	71800	71801	Charles Gould	250	" I assure you , Senor Hirsch , "
71803	71813	71800	71801	Charles Gould	250	" that you ran no risk on this occasion . "
71814	71893	71446	71449	the man from Esmeralda	2206	" That may be , senor , though I tremble yet . A most fierce man - to look at . And what does it mean ? A person employed by the Steamship Company talking with salteadores - no less , senor ; the other horsemen were salteadores - in a lonely place , and behaving like a robber himself ! A cigar is nothing , but what was there to prevent him asking me for my purse ? "
71894	71902	71903	71904	Charles Gould	250	" No , no , Senor Hirsch , "
71933	71959	71446	71449	the man from Esmeralda	2206	" If it was the Capataz de Cargadores you met - and there is no doubt , is there ? - you were perfectly safe . "
71960	72021	71446	71449	the man from Esmeralda	2206	" Thank you . You are very good . A very fierce - looking man , Don Carlos . He asked me for a cigar in a most familiar manner . What would have happened if I had not had a cigar ? I shudder yet . What business had he to be talking with robbers in a lonely place ? "
72122	72126	72116	72116	Some	2209	" Think it over "
72132	72135	72116	72116	Some	2209	" Go ahead "
72141	72145	72116	72116	Some	2209	" I see , "
72455	72502	72503	72503	He	250	" It is a great , great foolishness , Don Carlos , all this . The price of hides in Hamburg is gone up - up . Of course the Ribierist Government will do away with all that - when it gets established firmly . Meantime - "
72506	72511	72503	72503	He	250	" Yes , meantime , "
72635	72639	72640	72640	he	250	" Senor Hirsch , "
72643	72661	72663	72663	his	250	" I have enough dynamite stored up at the mountain to send it down crashing into the valley "
72669	72681	72663	72663	his	250	" to send half Sulaco into the air if I liked . "
72702	72709	72712	72712	he	250	" Just so . Just so . "
72815	72827	72828	72828	he	250	" What does he want to keep so much dynamite for ? "
72831	72842	72828	72828	he	250	" And why does he talk like this to me ? "
72895	72947	73073	73074	Charles Gould	250	" Good - night , I am going . Got my bike downstairs . The railway will know where to go for dynamite should we get short at any time . We have done cutting and chopping for a while now . We shall begin soon to blast our way through . "
72948	72955	72957	72958	Charles Gould	250	" Do n't come to me , "
72964	73010	72957	72958	Charles Gould	250	" I sha n't have an ounce to spare for anybody . Not an ounce . Not for my own brother , if I had a brother , and he were the engineer - in - chief of the most promising railway in the world . "
73011	73016	73018	73023	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" What 's that ? "
73028	73031	73018	73023	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Unkindness ? "
73032	73035	73037	73038	Charles Gould	250	" No , "
73042	73045	73037	73038	Charles Gould	250	" Policy . "
73046	73053	73054	73059	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Radical , I should think , "
73065	73072	73054	73059	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Is that the right name ? "
73084	73096	73097	73098	the engineer	6138	" I mean , going to the roots , you know , "
73107	73112	73097	73098	the engineer	6138	" Why , yes , "
73118	73168	73113	73113	Charles	250	" The Gould Concession has struck such deep roots in this country , in this province , in that gorge of the mountains , that nothing but dynamite shall be allowed to dislodge it from there . It 's my choice . It 's my last card to play . "
73178	73183	73184	73184	he	6133	" A pretty game , "
73193	73210	73184	73184	he	6133	" And have you told Holroyd of that extraordinary trump card you hold in your hand ? "
73211	73239	73169	73174	The engineer - in - chief	6133	" Card only when it 's played ; when it falls at the end of the game . Till then you may call it a - a - "
73240	73243	73245	73247	the railway man	2248	" Weapon , "
73249	73260	73262	73263	Charles Gould	250	" No . You may call it rather an argument , "
73267	73280	73262	73263	Charles Gould	250	" And that 's how I 've presented it to Mr. Holroyd . "
73281	73290	73292	73293	the engineer	6138	" And what did he say to it ? "
73299	73301	73292	73293	the engineer	6138	" He "
73311	73340	73303	73304	Charles Gould	250	" he said something about holding on like grim death and putting our trust in God . I should imagine he must have been rather startled . But then "
73351	73379	73380	73381	The engineer	6138	" but then , he is very far away , you know , and , as they say in this country , God is very high above . "
73476	73479	73465	73465	she	725	" Tired ? "
73484	73488	73490	73491	Mrs. Gould	248	" A little , "
73503	73515	73498	73498	she	725	" There is an awful sense of unreality about all this . "
73545	73560	73561	73561	he	250	" The heat and dust must have been awful this afternoon by the waterside , "
73566	73578	73561	73561	he	250	" The glare on the water must have been simply terrible . "
73579	73590	73592	73593	Mrs. Gould	248	" One could close one 's eyes to the glare , "
73595	73621	73622	73622	She	725	" But , my dear Charley , it is impossible for me to close my eyes to our position ; to this awful . . . "
73647	73656	73657	73657	she	725	" Why do n't you tell me something ? "
73661	73673	73657	73657	she	725	" I thought you had understood me perfectly from the first , "
73680	73763	73674	73675	Charles Gould	250	" I thought we had said all there was to say a long time ago . There is nothing to say now . There were things to be done . We have done them ; we have gone on doing them . There is no going back now . I do n't suppose that , even from the first , there was really any possible way back . And , what 's more , we ca n't even afford to stand still . "
73764	73778	73780	73781	his wife	725	" Ah , if one only knew how far you mean to go , "
73792	73802	73674	73675	Charles Gould	250	" Any distance , any length , of course , "
73861	73867	73868	73868	she	725	" But always to success , "
73892	73900	73901	73901	He	250	" Oh , there is no alternative . "
73943	73977	73940	73940	She	248	" I will leave you ; I 've a slight headache . The heat , the dust , were indeed - I suppose you are going back to the mine before the morning ? "
73978	73982	73984	73985	Charles Gould	250	" At midnight , "
73987	74011	73940	73940	She	248	" We are bringing down the silver to - morrow . Then I shall take three whole days off in town with you . "
74012	74044	74045	74046	Charles Gould	250	" Ah , you are going to meet the escort . I shall be on the balcony at five o'clock to see you pass . Till then , good - bye . "
74100	74112	74113	74113	she	248	" Try to get some rest for a couple of hours , "
74223	74235	74207	74208	Mrs. Gould	248	" Ah , if we had left it alone , Charley ! "
74236	74239	74240	74241	Charles Gould	250	" No , "
74246	74255	74240	74241	Charles Gould	250	" it was impossible to leave it alone . "
74256	74262	74263	74264	Mrs. Gould	248	" Perhaps it was impossible , "
74285	74303	74276	74276	she	248	" We have disturbed a good many snakes in that Paradise , Charley , have n't we ? "
74304	74310	74312	74313	Charles Gould	250	" Yes , I remember , "
74315	74358	74359	74359	He	250	" it was Don Pepe who called the gorge the Paradise of snakes . No doubt we have disturbed a great many . But remember , my dear , that it is not now as it was when you made that sketch . "
74377	74412	74413	74413	He	250	" It is no longer a Paradise of snakes . We have brought mankind into it , and we can not turn our backs upon them to go and begin a new life elsewhere . "
74580	74585	74586	74586	she	248	" Who 's there ? "
74594	74601	74586	74586	she	248	" Is that you , Basilio ? "
74627	74636	74638	74638	Decoud	257	" Antonia has forgotten her fan in here , "
74654	74686	74687	74687	Senora	402	" But , even as he said this , he had obviously given up his search , and walked straight towards Mrs. Gould , who looked at him with doubtful surprise . "
74689	74698	74687	74687	Senora	402	" he began , in a low voice . "
74706	74721	74703	74704	Don Martin	257	" asked Mrs. Gould . And then she added , with a slight laugh , "
74730	74741	74703	74704	Don Martin	257	" as if to explain the eagerness of the question . "
74746	74758	74703	74704	Don Martin	257	" said Decoud , who now could not conceal his agitation . "
74775	74809	74773	74773	yourself	257	" Mrs. Gould , with her candid eyes very wide open , her lips composed into a smile , was steadying herself with a little bejewelled hand against the side of the door . "
74825	74826	74827	74827	I	0	" "
74831	74840	74827	74827	I	0	" he protested , sincerely vexed and surprised . "
74902	74903	74896	74896	you	257	" "
74908	74926	74906	74906	senor	1479	" said behind Mrs. Gould the soft voice of Basilio , the head servant of the Casa . "
74943	74944	74931	74932	the senorita	2278	" "
74990	75001	75011	75011	his	2283	" - he addressed himself in English to Mrs. Gould - "
75036	75046	75024	75024	I	0	" He paused and Mrs. Gould said , amiably , "
75052	75061	75024	75024	I	0	" She paused for a second , too . "
75074	75082	75083	75083	I	0	" Decoud affected suddenly the utmost nonchalance . "
75146	75147	75132	75135	the Capataz de Cargadores	269	" "
75155	75160	75161	75162	The Violas	413	" inquired Mrs. Gould . "
75231	75232	75223	75223	I	0	" "
75236	75245	75223	75223	I	0	" said Mrs. Gould in a low voice . "
75340	75341	75329	75329	We	2300	" "
75349	75354	75329	75329	We	2300	" murmured Mrs. Gould . "
75458	75477	75438	75438	Our	2300	" Decoud , exchanging a steady stare with Mrs. Gould , added , tentatively , as it were , "
75489	75490	75491	75491	Montero	304	" "
75497	75508	75491	75491	Montero	304	" Mrs. Gould breathed out in a tone of unbelief . "
75553	75554	75547	75547	us	2300	" "
75560	75647	75547	75547	us	2300	" said Mrs. Gould , with the calmness of despair . Suddenly she seemed to divine , she seemed to see Decoud 's tremendous excitement under its cloak of studied carelessness . It was , indeed , becoming visible in his audacious and watchful stare , in the curve , half - reckless , half - contemptuous , of his lips . And a French phrase came upon them as if , for this Costaguanero of the Boulevard , that had been the only forcible language - "
75656	75673	75650	75650	Madame	414	" It electrified Mrs. Gould out of her benumbed attitude , and she said , vivaciously - "
75681	75695	75676	75676	you	2304	" But already there was something of mockery in Decoud 's suppressed excitement . "
75773	75774	75725	75729	a true hijo del pays	2306	" "
75777	75784	75725	75729	a true hijo del pays	2306	" said Mrs. Gould , doubtfully . "
75791	75799	75805	75805	my	0	" Decoud went on again in French . "
75808	75830	75805	75805	my	0	" Mrs. Gould received this addition unflinchingly . To understand it thoroughly she did not require to hear his muttered assurance - "
75865	75880	75881	75881	You	248	" Decoud seemed to find a fresh audacity in this voicing of his thoughts . "
75901	75929	75887	75887	I	0	" She made a sort of discouraged protest with her arm , as if to express that she had given up expecting that motive from any one . "
75934	75942	75887	75887	I	0	" Decoud pursued in a forcible undertone . "
75969	75988	75966	75967	Mrs. Gould	248	" Frowning , and biting her lower lip thoughtfully , she made a step away from the door . "
75999	76005	75989	75989	You	0	" Decoud arrested her anxiously . "
76013	76014	76037	76037	he	2311	" "
76018	76024	76037	76037	he	2311	" Decoud admitted without hesitation . "
76050	76069	76037	76037	he	2311	" A puzzled look came upon Mrs. Gould 's face , and Decoud , approaching , explained confidentially - "
76081	76097	76078	76079	an idealist	2313	" Mrs. Gould flushed pink , and her eyes grew darker at the same time . "
76102	76113	76099	76100	an idealist	2313	" she said , as if to herself , wonderingly . "
76121	76122	76118	76118	you	2311	" "
76125	76129	76118	76118	you	2311	" conceded Decoud , "
76178	76182	76183	76184	Mrs. Gould	248	" He paused . "
76215	76255	76210	76210	you	248	" He must have known what he was talking about . The effect he expected was produced . Mrs. Gould , ready to take fire , gave it up suddenly with a low little sound that resembled a moan . "
76261	76269	76258	76258	you	2311	" she asked in a feeble voice . "
76272	76278	76258	76258	you	2311	" answered Decoud , firmly . "
76293	76294	76290	76291	an Englishman	6337	" "
76301	76306	76290	76291	an Englishman	6337	" asked Mrs. Gould . "
76435	76445	76433	76433	yours	248	" Mrs. Gould gave no sign of being offended . "
76453	76454	76448	76448	Antonia	256	" "
76490	76491	76487	76488	Mrs. Gould	248	" "
76501	76505	76492	76492	Your	0	" she said . "
76511	76515	76492	76492	Your	0	" declared Martin . "
76552	76553	76550	76550	Antonia	256	" "
76559	76567	76550	76550	Antonia	256	" asked Mrs. Gould , without severity . "
76762	76793	76745	76745	You	2330	" The slight , protesting murmur on the part of Mrs. Gould made him pause for a moment , while he looked at her with a sombre and resolute glance . "
76859	76860	76861	76861	You	2330	" "
76866	76876	76861	76861	You	2330	" said Mrs. Gould , in a shocked voice . "
76943	76944	76935	76935	Sulaco	408	" "
76956	76957	76946	76946	you	2330	" "
77044	77135	77041	77042	Mrs. Gould	248	" It was evident that Mrs. Gould was very determined not to be offended . She smiled vaguely , while she seemed to think the matter over . As far as she could judge from the girl 's half - confidences , Antonia understood that young man . Obviously there was promise of safety in his plan , or rather in his idea . Moreover , right or wrong , the idea could do no harm . And it was quite possible , also , that the rumour was false . "
77144	77148	77136	77136	You	2330	" she said . "
77344	77368	77376	77376	your	2348	" Decoud had dropped easily into English , which he spoke with precision , very correctly , but with too many z sounds . "
77443	77472	77476	77476	you	2348	" Decoud finished his thought with an upward toss of the arm , suggesting annihilation ; and Mrs. Gould turned away her head with a look of horror . "
77484	77502	77476	77476	you	2348	" she asked , without looking at Decoud , who stood watching the effect of his words . "
77512	77520	77506	77507	Don Carlos	298	" he began . Mrs. Gould interrupted - "
77546	77547	77537	77537	He	298	" "
77552	77566	77537	77537	He	298	" Decoud almost cooed , in a tone of gentle and soothing deference . "
77711	77712	77701	77701	I	0	" "
77719	77730	77701	77701	I	0	" whispered Mrs. Gould , once more averting her head . "
77782	77791	77812	77813	Don Martin	257	" he reflected ; then added , meaningly , "
77801	77802	77803	77803	I	0	" "
77815	77830	77810	77810	you	248	" said Mrs. Gould , coldly , preserving the low key of their conversation . "
77844	77845	77841	77842	the other	937	" "
77856	77862	77841	77842	the other	937	" Decoud whispered , lightly . "
77882	77923	77877	77877	they	584	" But whatever was the reason of that remark , disparaging and complimentary at the same time , Mrs. Gould seemed not to pay attention to it . The name of Holroyd had given a new tone to her anxiety . "
77945	77951	77942	77943	Don Martin	257	" she cried in dismay . "
77959	77971	77942	77943	Don Martin	257	" breathed out Decoud , earnestly , almost into her ear . "
77996	78176	78199	78200	the telegraphist	2382	" objected Mrs. Gould . Decoud admitted that it was possible . He knew well the town children of the Sulaco Campo : sullen , thievish , vindictive , and bloodthirsty , whatever great qualities their brothers of the plain might have had . But then there was that other sentimentalist , who attached a strangely idealistic meaning to concrete facts . This stream of silver must be kept flowing north to return in the form of financial backing from the great house of Holroyd . Up at the mountain in the strong room of the mine the silver bars were worth less for his purpose than so much lead , from which at least bullets may be run . Let it come down to the harbour , ready for shipment . The next north - going steamer would carry it off for the very salvation of the San Tome mine , which had produced so much treasure . And , moreover , the rumour was probably false , he remarked , with much conviction in his hurried tone . "
78181	78185	78179	78179	senora	1489	" concluded Decoud , "
78331	78332	78333	78333	He	2384	" "
78339	78347	78333	78333	He	2384	" Mrs. Gould inquired , with interest . "
78357	78358	78350	78350	him	2384	" "
78368	78378	78350	78350	him	2384	" declared Decoud , in a slightly surprised tone . "
78429	78441	78403	78403	his	2384	" Decoud , interrupting himself , looked at Mrs. Gould curiously . "
78446	78450	78403	78403	his	2384	" he continued , "
78558	78559	78547	78547	he	2384	" "
78569	78585	78586	78586	Viola	279	" Mrs. Gould said in a tone as if she were repelling an undeserved aspersion . "
78605	78606	78588	78589	the Garibaldino	252	" "
78708	78709	78697	78697	I	0	" "
78721	78740	78714	78714	him	2384	" Mrs. Gould said , with the nearest approach to curtness it was in her nature to assume . "
78783	78856	78857	78857	I	0	" Mrs. Gould glanced along the corredor towards the door of her husband 's room . Decoud , watching her as if she had his fate in her hands , detected an almost imperceptible nod of assent . He bowed with a smile , and , putting his hand into the breast pocket of his coat , pulled out a fan of light feathers set upon painted leaves of sandal - wood . "
78864	78870	78857	78857	I	0	" he murmured , triumphantly , "
78876	78881	78857	78857	I	0	" He bowed again . "
78888	79038	78857	78857	I	0	" Mrs. Gould continued along the corredor away from her husband 's room . The fate of the San Tome mine was lying heavy upon her heart . It was a long time now since she had begun to fear it . It had been an idea . She had watched it with misgivings turning into a fetish , and now the fetish had grown into a monstrous and crushing weight . It was as if the inspiration of their early years had left her heart to turn into a wall of silver - bricks , erected by the silent work of evil spirits , between her and her husband . He seemed to dwell alone within a circumvallation of precious metal , leaving her outside with her school , her hospital , the sick mothers and the feeble old men , mere insignificant vestiges of the initial inspiration . "
79043	79063	78857	78857	I	0	" she murmured to herself . Below she heard the voice of Martin Decoud in the patio speaking loudly : "
79080	79232	79072	79072	Basilio	315	" CHAPTER SEVEN It was part of what Decoud would have called his sane materialism that he did not believe in the possibility of friendship between man and woman . The one exception he allowed confirmed , he maintained , that absolute rule . Friendship was possible between brother and sister , meaning by friendship the frank unreserve , as before another human being , of thoughts and sensations ; all the objectless and necessary sincerity of one 's innermost life trying to re - act upon the profound sympathies of another existence . His favourite sister , the handsome , slightly arbitrary and resolute angel , ruling the father and mother Decoud in the first - floor apartments of a very fine Parisian house , was the recipient of Martin Decoud 's confidences as to his thoughts , actions , purposes , doubts , and even failures . . . . "
79673	79721	79722	79722	He	2443	" The Capataz of Cargadores , that Italian sailor of whom I have written to you before , has saved him from an ignoble death . That man seems to have a particular talent for being on the spot whenever there is something picturesque to be done . "
79827	80293	80294	80294	I	0	" The sun shines late upon Sulaco , for it has first to climb above the mountains . In that clear morning light , brighter than twilight , Nostromo saw right across the vast Plaza , at the end of the street beyond the cathedral , a mounted man apparently in difficulties with a yelling knot of leperos . At once he said to me , ' That 's a stranger . What is it they are doing to him ? ' Then he took out the silver whistle he is in the habit of using on the wharf this man seems to disdain the use of any metal less precious than silver and blew into it twice , evidently a preconcerted signal for his Cargadores . He ran out immediately , and they rallied round him . I ran out , too , but was too late to follow them and help in the rescue of the stranger , whose animal had fallen . I was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat , and was only too glad to get into the club , where Don Jaime Berges you may remember him visiting at our house in Paris some three years ago thrust a sporting gun into my hands . They were already firing from the windows . There were little heaps of cartridges lying about on the open card - tables . I remember a couple of overturned chairs , some bottles rolling on the floor amongst the packs of cards scattered suddenly as the caballeros rose from their game to open fire upon the mob . Most of the young men had spent the night at the club in the expectation of some such disturbance . In two of the candelabra , on the consoles , the candles were burning down in their sockets . A large iron nut , probably stolen from the railway workshops , flew in from the street as I entered , and broke one of the large mirrors set in the wall . I noticed also one of the club servants tied up hand and foot with the cords of the curtain and flung in a corner . I have a vague recollection of Don Jaime assuring me hastily that the fellow had been detected putting poison into the dishes at supper . But I remember distinctly he was shrieking for mercy , without stopping at all , continuously , and so absolutely disregarded that nobody even took the trouble to gag him . The noise he made was so disagreeable that I had half a mind to do it myself . But there was no time to waste on such trifles . I took my place at one of the windows and began firing . "
80422	80462	80391	80391	senor	1479	" Decoud paused to light a cigarette , then , with his head still over his writing , he blew a cloud of smoke , which seemed to rebound from the paper . He took up the pencil again . "
80863	81289	81296	81298	Don Martin Decoud	257	" Their last move of eight o'clock last night was to organize themselves into a Monterist Committee which sits , as far as I know , in a posada kept by a retired Mexican bull - fighter , a great politician , too , whose name I have forgotten . Thence they have issued a communication to us , the Goths and Paralytics of the Amarilla Club who have our own committee , inviting us to come to some provisional understanding for a truce , in order , they have the impudence to say , that the noble cause of Liberty ' should not be stained by the criminal excesses of Conservative selfishness ! ' As I came out to sit with Nostromo on the cathedral steps the club was busy considering a proper reply in the principal room , littered with exploded cartridges , with a lot of broken glass , blood smears , candlesticks , and all sorts of wreckage on the floor . But all this is nonsense . Nobody in the town has any real power except the railway engineers , whose men occupy the dismantled houses acquired by the Company for their town station on one side of the Plaza , and Nostromo , whose Cargadores were sleeping under the arcades along the front of Anzani 's shops . A fire of broken furniture out of the Intendencia saloons , mostly gilt , was burning on the Plaza , in a high flame swaying right upon the statue of Charles IV . The dead body of a man was lying on the steps of the pedestal , his arms thrown wide open , and his sombrero covering his face - the attention of some friend , perhaps . The light of the flames touched the foliage of the first trees on the Alameda , and played on the end of a side street near by , blocked up by a jumble of ox - carts and dead bullocks . Sitting on one of the carcasses , a lepero , muffled up , smoked a cigarette . It was a truce , you understand . The only other living being on the Plaza besides ourselves was a Cargador walking to and fro , with a long , bare knife in his hand , like a sentry before the Arcades , where his friends were sleeping . And the only other spot of light in the dark town were the lighted windows of the club , at the corner of the Calle . "
81755	81765	81746	81746	He	257	" I wonder if there 's any bread here , "
81965	81971	81960	81960	he	257	" I am very hungry . "
81972	81984	81985	81985	he	257	" I have the feeling of a great solitude around me , "
81988	82329	81985	81985	he	257	" Is it , perhaps , because I am the only man with a definite idea in his head , in the complete collapse of every resolve , intention , and hope about me ? But the solitude is also very real . All the engineers are out , and have been for two days , looking after the property of the National Central Railway , of that great Costaguana undertaking which is to put money into the pockets of Englishmen , Frenchmen , Americans , Germans , and God knows who else . The silence about me is ominous . There is above the middle part of this house a sort of first floor , with narrow openings like loopholes for windows , probably used in old times for the better defence against the savages , when the persistent barbarism of our native continent did not wear the black coats of politicians , but went about yelling , half - naked , with bows and arrows in its hands . The woman of the house is dying up there , I believe , all alone with her old husband . There is a narrow staircase , the sort of staircase one man could easily defend against a mob , leading up there , and I have just heard , through the thickness of the wall , the old fellow going down into their kitchen for something or other . It was a sort of noise a mouse might make behind the plaster of a wall . All the servants they had ran away yesterday and have not returned yet , if ever they do . For the rest , there are only two children here , two girls . The father has sent them downstairs , and they have crept into this cafe , perhaps because I am here . They huddle together in a corner , in each other 's arms ; I just noticed them a few minutes ago , and I feel more lonely than ever . "
82341	82348	82335	82335	his	257	" Is there any bread here ? "
82371	82380	82382	82382	Decoud	257	" You could n't get me some bread ? "
82404	82412	82413	82413	he	257	" You 're not afraid of me ? "
82416	82419	82421	82421	Linda	284	" No , "
82423	82439	82421	82421	Linda	284	" we are not afraid of you . You came here with Gian ' Battista . "
82440	82445	82447	82447	Decoud	257	" You mean Nostromo ? "
82449	82467	82469	82470	the girl	7115	" The English call him so , but that is no name either for man or beast , "
82482	82491	82493	82493	Decoud	257	" But he lets people call him so , "
82495	82501	82503	82504	the child	2513	" Not in this house , "
82506	82519	82503	82504	the child	2513	" Ah ! well , I shall call him the Capataz then . "
82537	82545	82546	82546	he	257	" When do you expect him back ? "
82549	82575	82546	82546	he	257	" After he brought you here he rode off to fetch the Senor Doctor from the town for mother . He will be back soon . "
82576	82590	82591	82591	Decoud	257	" He stands a good chance of getting shot somewhere on the road , "
82607	82620	82601	82601	her	284	" Nobody would dare to fire a shot at Gian ' Battista . "
82621	82626	82628	82628	Decoud	257	" You believe that , "
82630	82634	82601	82601	her	284	" do you ? "
82635	82640	82642	82643	the child	2513	" I know it , "
82648	82664	82642	82643	the child	2513	" There is no one in this place brave enough to attack Gian ' Battista . "
82665	82680	82684	82684	himself	257	" It does n't require much bravery to pull a trigger behind a bush , "
82686	82709	82684	82684	himself	257	" Fortunately , the night is dark , or there would be but little chance of saving the silver of the mine . "
82731	83162	82728	82728	his	257	" That was the position yesterday , after the Minerva with the fugitive President had gone out of harbour , and the rioters had been driven back into the side lanes of the town . I sat on the steps of the cathedral with Nostromo , after sending out the cable message for the information of a more or less attentive world . Strangely enough , though the offices of the Cable Company are in the same building as the Porvenir , the mob , which has thrown my presses out of the window and scattered the type all over the Plaza , has been kept from interfering with the instruments on the other side of the courtyard . As I sat talking with Nostromo , Bernhardt , the telegraphist , came out from under the Arcades with a piece of paper in his hand . The little man had tied himself up to an enormous sword and was hung all over with revolvers . He is ridiculous , but the bravest German of his size that ever tapped the key of a Morse transmitter . He had received the message from Cayta reporting the transports with Barrios 's army just entering the port , and ending with the words , ' The greatest enthusiasm prevails . ' I walked off to drink some water at the fountain , and I was shot at from the Alameda by somebody hiding behind a tree . But I drank , and did n't care ; with Barrios in Cayta and the great Cordillera between us and Montero 's victorious army I seemed , notwithstanding Messrs. Gamacho and Fuentes , to hold my new State in the hollow of my hand . I was ready to sleep , but when I got as far as the Casa Gould I found the patio full of wounded laid out on straw . Lights were burning , and in that enclosed courtyard on that hot night a faint odour of chloroform and blood hung about . At one end Doctor Monygham , the doctor of the mine , was dressing the wounds ; at the other , near the stairs , Father Corbelan , kneeling , listened to the confession of a dying Cargador . Mrs. Gould was walking about through these shambles with a large bottle in one hand and a lot of cotton wool in the other . She just looked at me and never even winked . Her camerista was following her , also holding a bottle , and sobbing gently to herself . "
83485	83575	83576	83576	They	2535	" In the great sala upstairs a sort of Junta of Notables was sitting , the remnant of the vanished Provincial Assembly . Don Juste Lopez had had half his beard singed off at the muzzle of a trabuco loaded with slugs , of which every one missed him , providentially . And as he turned his head from side to side it was exactly as if there had been two men inside his frock - coat , one nobly whiskered and solemn , the other untidy and scared . "
83710	83918	83925	83925	I	0	" I walked up to the table blindly , as though I had been drunk . ' You are deliberating upon surrender , ' I said . They all sat still , with their noses over the sheet of paper each had before him , God only knows why . Only Don Jose hid his face in his hands , muttering , ' Never , never ! ' But as I looked at him , it seemed to me that I could have blown him away with my breath , he looked so frail , so weak , so worn out . Whatever happens , he will not survive . The deception is too great for a man of his age ; and has n't he seen the sheets of ' Fifty Years of Misrule , ' which we have begun printing on the presses of the Porvenir , littering the Plaza , floating in the gutters , fired out as wads for trabucos loaded with handfuls of type , blown in the wind , trampled in the mud ? I have seen pages floating upon the very waters of the harbour . It would be unreasonable to expect him to survive . It would be cruel . "
83948	84204	83925	83925	I	0	" I declaimed for five minutes without drawing breath , it seems to me , harping on our best chances , on the ferocity of Montero , whom I made out to be as great a beast as I have no doubt he would like to be if he had intelligence enough to conceive a systematic reign of terror . And then for another five minutes or more I poured out an impassioned appeal to their courage and manliness , with all the passion of my love for Antonia . For if ever man spoke well , it would be from a personal feeling , denouncing an enemy , defending himself , or pleading for what really may be dearer than life . My dear girl , I absolutely thundered at them . It seemed as if my voice would burst the walls asunder , and when I stopped I saw all their scared eyes looking at me dubiously . And that was all the effect I had produced ! Only Don Jose 's head had sunk lower and lower on his breast . I bent my ear to his withered lips , and made out his whisper , something like , ' In God 's name , then , Martin , my son ! ' I do n't know exactly . There was the name of God in it , I am certain . It seems to me I have caught his last breath - the breath of his departing soul on his lips . "
84356	84654	84333	84333	I	0	" Meanwhile , Don Juste had begun a pondered oration whose solemn effect was spoiled by the ridiculous disaster to his beard . I did not wait to make it out . He seemed to argue that Montero 's he called him The General intentions were probably not evil , though , he went on , ' that distinguished man ' only a week ago we used to call him a gran ' bestia ' was perhaps mistaken as to the true means . ' As you may imagine , I did n't stay to hear the rest . I know the intentions of Montero 's brother , Pedrito , the guerrillero , whom I exposed in Paris , some years ago , in a cafe frequented by South American students , where he tried to pass himself off for a Secretary of Legation . He used to come in and talk for hours , twisting his felt hat in his hairy paws , and his ambition seemed to become a sort of Duc de Morny to a sort of Napoleon . Already , then , he used to talk of his brother in inflated terms . He seemed fairly safe from being found out , because the students , all of the Blanco families , did not , as you may imagine , frequent the Legation . It was only Decoud , a man without faith and principles , as they used to say , that went in there sometimes for the sake of the fun , as it were to an assembly of trained monkeys . I know his intentions . I have seen him change the plates at table . Whoever is allowed to live on in terror , I must die the death . "
84722	84735	84714	84714	she	2551	" ' What are they doing in there ? ' she asked . "
84750	84759	84740	84740	I	0	" ' Yes , yes , but - ' "
84811	84847	84804	84804	She	2551	" Through the door I held a little ajar behind me , we heard Dun Juste 's measured mouthing monotone go on from phrase to phrase , like a sort of awful and solemn madness . "
84888	84934	84945	84945	she	2551	" I crashed the door to on that ; it was enough ; it was too much . There was never a beautiful face expressing more horror and despair than the face of Antonia . I could n't bear it ; I seized her wrists . "
84948	84970	84945	84945	she	2551	" Her eyes blazed with indignation , but as I looked on , fascinated , the light in them went out . "
85017	85169	85170	85170	She	2559	" My dear girl , there is that in Antonia which would make me believe in the feasibility of anything . One look at her face is enough to set my brain on fire . And yet I love her as any other man would - with the heart , and with that alone . She is more to me than his Church to Father Corbelan the Grand Vicar disappeared last night from the town ; perhaps gone to join the band of Hernandez . She is more to me than his precious mine to that sentimental Englishman . I wo n't speak of his wife . She may have been sentimental once . The San Tome mine stands now between those two people . ' Your father himself , Antonia , ' I repeated ; ' your father , do you understand ? has told me to go on . ' "
85181	85204	85172	85172	her	2559	" ' He has ? ' she cried . ' Then , indeed , I fear he will never speak again . ' "
85341	85374	85375	85378	El Rey de Sulaco	408	" Late at night we formed a small junta of four - the two women , Don Carlos , and myself - in Mrs. Gould 's blue - and - white boudoir . "
85773	85802	85803	85803	He	6133	" ' And here , in this boudoir , ' I said , ' you behold the inner cabinet of the Occidental Republic that is to be . ' "
85822	85989	85815	85815	he	6133	" He told us that he was attending to the general dispositions for the defence of the railway property at the railway yards when he was sent for to go into the railway telegraph office . The engineer of the railhead , at the foot of the mountains , wanted to talk to him from his end of the wire . There was nobody in the office but himself and the operator of the railway telegraph , who read off the clicks aloud as the tape coiled its length upon the floor . And the purport of that talk , clicked nervously from a wooden shed in the depths of the forests , had informed the chief that President Ribiera had been , or was being , pursued . This was news , indeed , to all of us in Sulaco . Ribiera himself , when rescued , revived , and soothed by us , had been inclined to think that he had not been pursued . "
86498	86642	86471	86471	him	2628	" He had his feet wrapped up in blood - stained rags , a lean , haggard face , ragged beard and hair , and had walked in limping , with a crooked branch of a tree for a staff . His followers were perhaps in a worse plight , but apparently they had not thrown away their arms , and , at any rate , not all their ammunition . Their lean faces filled the door and the windows of the telegraph hut . As it was at the same time the bedroom of the engineer - in - charge there , Montero had thrown himself on his clean blankets and lay there shivering and dictating requisitions to be transmitted by wire to Sulaco . He demanded a train of cars to be sent down at once to transport his men up . "
86721	86740	86718	86719	my subordinate	2639	" The filthy brute on my bed said , ' Suppose I were to have you shot ? ' "
86775	86789	86768	86769	the other	937	" Never mind , there is no lack of horses on the Campo . "
86804	86890	86768	86769	the other	937	" This is why , my dear girl , I am a fugitive to - night . The last wire from railhead says that Pedro Montero and his men left at daybreak , after feeding on asado beef all night . They took all the horses ; they will find more on the road ; they 'll be here in less than thirty hours , and thus Sulaco is no place either for me or the great store of silver belonging to the Gould Concession . "
87083	87204	87050	87050	his	2382	" But , as a matter of fact , he managed somehow to escape the vigilance of his captors , who had tried to stop the communication with the outer world . He did manage it . How it was done I do n't know , but a few hours afterwards he called up Sulaco again , and what he said was , ' The insurgent army has taken possession of the Government transport in the bay and are filling her with troops , with the intention of going round the coast to Sulaco . Therefore look out for yourselves . They will be ready to start in a few hours , and may be upon you before daybreak . ' "
87238	87323	87225	87225	Bernhardt	419	" After setting these words down in the pocket - book which he was filling up for the benefit of his sister , Decoud lifted his head to listen . But there were no sounds , neither in the room nor in the house , except the drip of the water from the filter into the vast earthenware jar under the wooden stand . And outside the house there was a great silence . Decoud lowered his head again over the pocket - book . "
87333	87338	87330	87330	you	2661	" he wrote on . "
87566	87892	87895	87897	Capataz de Cargadores	269	" His wife has understood it , too . That is why she is such a good ally of mine . She seizes upon all my suggestions with a sure instinct that in the end they make for the safety of the Gould Concession . And he defers to her because he trusts her perhaps , but I fancy rather as if he wished to make up for some subtle wrong , for that sentimental unfaithfulness which surrenders her happiness , her life , to the seduction of an idea . The little woman has discovered that he lives for the mine rather than for her . But let them be . To each his fate , shaped by passion or sentiment . The principal thing is that she has backed up my advice to get the silver out of the town , out of the country , at once , at any cost , at any risk . Don Carlos ' mission is to preserve unstained the fair fame of his mine ; Mrs. Gould 's mission is to save him from the effects of that cold and overmastering passion , which she dreads more than if it were an infatuation for another woman . Nostromo 's mission is to save the silver . The plan is to load it into the largest of the Company 's lighters , and send it across the gulf to a small port out of Costaguana territory just on the other side the Azuera , where the first northbound steamer will get orders to pick it up . The waters here are calm . We shall slip away into the darkness of the gulf before the Esmeralda rebels arrive ; and by the time the day breaks over the ocean we shall be out of sight , invisible , hidden by Azuera , which itself looks from the Sulaco shore like a faint blue cloud on the horizon . "
87956	88058	88059	88059	I	0	" I shall not see her again now before I depart . I left her , as I have said , by Don Jose 's bedside . The street was dark , the houses shut up , and I walked out of the town in the night . Not a single street - lamp had been lit for two days , and the archway of the gate was only a mass of darkness in the vague form of a tower , in which I heard low , dismal groans , that seemed to answer the murmurs of a man 's voice . "
88216	88489	88168	88168	He	2677	" He joined me on the harbour road after I had passed them under the dark archway without stopping . It was a woman in trouble he had been talking to . Through discretion I kept silent while he walked by my side . After a time he began to talk himself . It was not what I expected . It was only an old woman , an old lace - maker , in search of her son , one of the street - sweepers employed by the municipality . Friends had come the day before at daybreak to the door of their hovel calling him out . He had gone with them , and she had not seen him since ; so she had left the food she had been preparing half - cooked on the extinct embers and had crawled out as far as the harbour , where she had heard that some town mozos had been killed on the morning of the riot . One of the Cargadores guarding the Custom House had brought out a lantern , and had helped her to look at the few dead left lying about there . Now she was creeping back , having failed in her search . So she sat down on the stone seat under the arch , moaning , because she was very tired . The Capataz had questioned her , and after hearing her broken and groaning tale had advised her to go and look amongst the wounded in the patio of the Casa Gould . He had also given her a quarter dollar , he mentioned carelessly . "
88490	88509	88513	88513	senor	1479	" ' Why did you do that ? ' I asked . ' Do you know her ? ' "
88669	88703	88666	88666	he	0	" I made no comment . He 's known for his liberality and his bad luck at the game of monte , which keeps him as poor as when he first came here . "
88742	88840	88712	88712	he	0	" I said that it could not be otherwise , surely . He walked on , muttering to himself . ' Si , si , without doubt , without doubt ; and , look you , Senor Martin , what it is to be well spoken of ! There is not another man that could have been even thought of for such a thing . I shall get something great for it some day . And let it come soon , ' he mumbled . ' Time passes in this country as quick as anywhere else . ' "
88992	89283	89331	89331	his	404	" I am waiting for him here now . On arriving at the posada kept by Viola we found the children alone down below , and the old Genoese shouted to his countryman to go and fetch the doctor . Otherwise we would have gone on to the wharf , where it appears Captain Mitchell with some volunteer Europeans and a few picked Cargadores are loading the lighter with the silver that must be saved from Montero 's clutches in order to be used for Montero 's defeat . Nostromo galloped furiously back towards the town . He has been long gone already . This delay gives me time to talk to you . By the time this pocket - book reaches your hands much will have happened . But now it is a pause under the hovering wing of death in this silent house buried in the black night , with this dying woman , the two children crouching without a sound , and that old man whom I can hear through the thickness of the wall passing up and down with a light rubbing noise no louder than a mouse . And I , the only other with them , do n't really know whether to count myself with the living or with the dead . ' Quien sabe ? ' as the people here are prone to say in answer to every question . But no ! feeling for you is certainly not dead , and the whole thing , the house , the dark night , the silent children in this dim room , my very presence here - all this is life , must be life , since it is so much like a dream . "
89419	89435	89437	89437	Nostromo	251	" I have brought that sour - faced English doctor in Senora Gould 's carriage , "
89439	89469	89470	89470	He	404	" I doubt if , with all his wisdom , he can save the Padrona this time . They have sent for the children . A bad sign that . "
89480	89492	89470	89470	He	404	" She wants to give them her blessing , I suppose . "
89658	89667	89668	89668	she	248	" Teresa wants to see you , Nostromo , "
89693	89703	89704	89704	he	257	" The silver , Mrs. Gould , the silver , "
89709	89733	89704	89704	he	257	" Do n't forget that the Esmeralda garrison have got a steamer . They may appear at any moment at the harbour entrance . "
89734	89743	89744	89745	Mrs. Gould	248	" The doctor says there is no hope , "
89753	89775	89776	89776	She	248	" I shall take you down to the wharf in my carriage and then come back to fetch away the girls . "
89785	89801	89776	89776	She	248	" Why are you wasting time ? Old Giorgio 's wife wishes to see you . "
89802	89811	89813	89814	the Capataz	251	" I am going to her , senora , "
89975	89984	89967	89967	Nostromo	251	" Is she really dying , senor doctor ? "
89985	89988	89990	89991	the doctor	6199	" Yes , "
90002	90015	89990	89991	the doctor	6199	" And why she wants to see you I can not imagine . "
90016	90024	90026	90026	Nostromo	251	" She has been like that before , "
90031	90048	90050	90051	Dr. Monygham	249	" Well , Capataz , I can assure you she will never be like that again , "
90053	90102	90050	90051	Dr. Monygham	249	" You may go to her or stay away . There is very little to be got from talking to the dying . But she told Dona Emilia in my hearing that she has been like a mother to you ever since you first set foot ashore here . "
90103	90151	90212	90212	He	270	" Si ! And she never had a good word to say for me to anybody . It is more as if she could not forgive me for being alive , and such a man , too , as she would have liked her son to be . "
90152	90155	90212	90212	He	270	" Maybe ! "
90164	90174	90212	90212	He	270	" Women have their own ways of tormenting themselves . "
90267	90281	90282	90282	he	270	" Give her a spoonful of this now and then , in water , "
90285	90292	90282	90282	he	270	" It will make her easier . "
90293	90302	90304	90306	the old man	953	" And there is nothing more for her ? "
90310	90317	90319	90320	the doctor	6199	" No . Not on earth , "
90578	90585	90587	90588	Senora Teresa	433	" Their revolutions , their revolutions , "
90590	90604	90605	90605	Nostromo	251	" Look , Gian ' Battista , it has killed me at last ! "
90619	90643	90610	90616	the sick woman with an upward glance	2737	" Look , this one has killed me , while you were away fighting for what did not concern you , foolish man . "
90644	90650	90655	90655	his	269	" Why talk like this ? "
90658	90683	90655	90655	his	269	" Will you never believe in my good sense ? It concerns me to keep on being what I am : every day alike . "
90684	90691	90692	90692	she	2737	" You never change , indeed , "
90697	90718	90692	90692	she	2737	" Always thinking of yourself and taking your pay out in fine words from those who care nothing for you . "
91020	91029	91030	91030	he	270	" A man ought not to be tame , "
91251	91304	91247	91248	The Capataz	269	" I have heard these things many times . You are unjust , but it does not hurt me . Only now you do not seem to have much strength to talk , and I have but little time to listen . I am engaged in a work of very great moment . "
91374	91384	91385	91385	she	725	" I want a priest more than a doctor , "
91416	91436	91437	91437	Nostromo	251	" Would you go to fetch a priest for me now ? Think ! A dying woman asks you ! "
91505	91508	91509	91509	he	251	" Padrona , "
91512	91549	91509	91509	he	251	" you have been like this before , and got better after a few days . I have given you already the very last moments I can spare . Ask Senora Gould to send you one . "
91637	91643	91644	91644	she	2776	" You refuse to go ? "
91647	91657	91644	91644	she	2776	" Ah ! you are always yourself , indeed . "
91658	91665	91666	91666	he	251	" Listen to reason , Padrona , "
91669	91727	91666	91666	he	251	" I am needed to save the silver of the mine . Do you hear ? A greater treasure than the one which they say is guarded by ghosts and devils on Azuera . It is true . I am resolved to make this the most desperate affair I was ever engaged on in my whole life . "
91782	91823	91824	91824	She	2776	" Then God , perhaps , will have mercy upon me ! But do you look to it , man , that you get something for yourself out of it , besides the remorse that shall overtake you some day . "
91828	91879	91824	91824	She	2776	" Get riches at least for once , you indispensable , admired Gian ' Battista , to whom the peace of a dying woman is less than the praise of people who have given you a silly name - and nothing besides - in exchange for your soul and body . "
91891	91961	91962	91962	He	269	" Leave my soul alone , Padrona , and I shall know how to take care of my body . Where is the harm of people having need of me ? What are you envying me that I have robbed you and the children of ? Those very people you are throwing in my teeth have done more for old Giorgio than they ever thought of doing for me . "
92003	92288	91985	91985	He	269	" Is it my fault that I am the only man for their purposes ? What angry nonsense are you talking , mother ? Would you rather have me timid and foolish , selling water - melons on the market - place or rowing a boat for passengers along the harbour , like a soft Neapolitan without courage or reputation ? Would you have a young man live like a monk ? I do not believe it . Would you want a monk for your eldest girl ? Let her grow . What are you afraid of ? You have been angry with me for everything I did for years ; ever since you first spoke to me , in secret from old Giorgio , about your Linda . Husband to one and brother to the other , did you say ? Well , why not ! I like the little ones , and a man must marry some time . But ever since that time you have been making little of me to everyone . Why ? Did you think you could put a collar and chain on me as if I were one of the watch - dogs they keep over there in the railway yards ? Look here , Padrona , I am the same man who came ashore one evening and sat down in the thatched ranche you lived in at that time on the other side of the town and told you all about himself . You were not unjust to me then . What has happened since ? I am no longer an insignificant youth . A good name , Giorgio says , is a treasure , Padrona . "
92289	92299	92301	92303	the sick woman	2778	" They have turned your head with their praises , "
92305	92338	92301	92303	the sick woman	2778	" They have been paying you with words . Your folly shall betray you into poverty , misery , starvation . The very leperos shall laugh at you - the great Capataz . "
92565	92570	92572	92572	Nostromo	251	" Adios , viejo , "
92611	92706	92591	92591	He	251	" Adios , look after the things in my sleeping - room , and if you hear from me no more , give up the box to Paquita . There is not much of value there , except my new serape from Mexico , and a few silver buttons on my best jacket . No matter ! The things will look well enough on the next lover she gets , and the man need not be afraid I shall linger on earth after I am dead , like those Gringos that haunt the Azuera . "
92741	92755	92738	92738	he	249	" Why , Capataz ! I thought you could never fail in anything . "
92800	92804	92805	92805	he	251	" No wind ! "
92810	92825	92805	92805	he	251	" Look here , senor - do you know the nature of my undertaking ? "
92831	92921	92826	92827	Dr. Monygham	249	" It is as if I were taking up a curse upon me , senor doctor . A man with a treasure on this coast will have every knife raised against him in every place upon the shore . You see that , senor doctor ? I shall float along with a spell upon my life till I meet somewhere the north - bound steamer of the Company , and then indeed they will talk about the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores from one end of America to another . "
92938	92988	92931	92931	Nostromo	251	" But if your worship can find any other man ready and fit for such business I will stand back . I am not exactly tired of my life , though I am so poor that I can carry all I have with myself on my horse 's back . "
92989	93008	93010	93011	Dr. Monygham	249	" You gamble too much , and never say ' no ' to a pretty face , Capataz , "
93017	93058	93010	93011	Dr. Monygham	249	" That 's not the way to make a fortune . But nobody that I know ever suspected you of being poor . I hope you have made a good bargain in case you come back safe from this adventure . "
93059	93068	93070	93070	Nostromo	251	" What bargain would your worship have made ? "
93105	93133	93093	93093	he	249	" Illustrious Capataz , for taking the curse of death upon my back , as you call it , nothing else but the whole treasure would do . "
93232	93241	93226	93227	Mrs. Gould	248	" They are waiting for you , Capataz ! "
93274	93282	93283	93283	he	257	" Perhaps my last words to her , "
93468	93492	93458	93463	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" If it must be lost , it is a million times better that it should go to the bottom of the sea . "
93501	93520	93493	93494	Martin Decoud	257	" Au revoir , messieurs , till we clasp hands again over the new - born Occidental Republic . "
93735	93744	93750	93750	Nostromo	251	" We are out in the gulf now , "
93758	93766	93755	93755	he	251	" Senor Mitchell has lowered the light . "
93767	93770	93772	93772	Decoud	257	" Yes , "
93774	93781	93772	93772	Decoud	257	" nobody can find us now . "
93915	93926	93928	93928	Nostromo	251	" On your left as you look forward , senor , "
94156	94221	94142	94142	he	251	" Have you been asleep , Don Martin ? Caramba ! If it were possible I would think that I , too , have dozed off . I have a strange notion somehow of having dreamt that there was a sound of blubbering , a sound a sorrowing man could make , somewhere near this boat . Something between a sigh and a sob . "
94222	94225	94227	94227	Decoud	257	" Strange ! "
94241	94265	94142	94142	he	251	" Could it be that there is another boat near us in the gulf ? We could not see it , you know . "
94308	94313	94314	94314	he	257	" This is overpowering , "
94317	94326	94314	94314	he	257	" Do we move at all , Capataz ? "
94327	94340	94342	94342	Nostromo	251	" Not so fast as a crawling beetle tangled in the grass , "
94665	94668	94669	94669	he	251	" Senor , "
94672	94947	94669	94669	he	251	" we must catch the steamer at sea . We must keep out in the open looking for her till we have eaten and drunk all that has been put on board here . And if we miss her by some mischance , we must keep away from the land till we grow weak , and perhaps mad , and die , and drift dead , until one or another of the steamers of the Compania comes upon the boat with the two dead men who have saved the treasure . That , senor , is the only way to save it ; for , do n't you see ? for us to come to the land anywhere in a hundred miles along this coast with this silver in our possession is to run the naked breast against the point of a knife . This thing has been given to me like a deadly disease . If men discover it I am dead , and you , too , senor , since you would come with me . There is enough silver to make a whole province rich , let alone a seaboard pueblo inhabited by thieves and vagabonds . Senor , they would think that heaven itself sent these riches into their hands , and would cut our throats without hesitation . I would trust no fair words from the best man around the shores of this wild gulf . Reflect that , even by giving up the treasure at the first demand , we would not be able to save our lives . Do you understand this , or must I explain ? "
94948	94956	94958	94958	Decoud	257	" No , you need n't explain , "
94964	95011	94958	94958	Decoud	257	" I can see it well enough myself , that the possession of this treasure is very much like a deadly disease for men situated as we are . But it had to be removed from Sulaco , and you were the man for the task . "
95012	95022	95024	95024	Nostromo	251	" I was ; but I can not believe , "
95026	95272	95024	95024	Nostromo	251	" that its loss would have impoverished Don Carlos Gould very much . There is more wealth in the mountain . I have heard it rolling down the shoots on quiet nights when I used to ride to Rincon to see a certain girl , after my work at the harbour was done . For years the rich rocks have been pouring down with a noise like thunder , and the miners say that there is enough at the heart of the mountain to thunder on for years and years to come . And yet , the day before yesterday , we have been fighting to save it from the mob , and to - night I am sent out with it into this darkness , where there is no wind to get away with ; as if it were the last lot of silver on earth to get bread for the hungry with . Ha ! ha ! Well , I am going to make it the most famous and desperate affair of my life - wind or no wind . It shall be talked about when the little children are grown up and the grown men are old . Aha ! the Monterists must not get hold of it , I am told , whatever happens to Nostromo the Capataz ; and they shall not have it , I tell you , since it has been tied for safety round Nostromo 's neck . "
95273	95278	95280	95280	Decoud	257	" I see it , "
95506	95514	95515	95515	he	251	" We are making a crooked path , "
95520	95529	95515	95515	he	251	" I wish I could see the islands . "
95704	95713	95714	95714	he	257	" I am on the verge of delirium , "
95743	95750	95751	95751	he	257	" Shall we rest , Capataz ? "
95758	95769	95751	95751	he	257	" There are many hours of night yet before us . "
95770	95950	95751	95751	he	257	" True . It is but a mile or so , I suppose . Rest your arms , senor , if that is what you mean . You will find no other sort of rest , I can promise you , since you let yourself be bound to this treasure whose loss would make no poor man poorer . No , senor ; there is no rest till we find a north - bound steamer , or else some ship finds us drifting about stretched out dead upon the Englishman 's silver . Or rather - no ; por Dios ! I shall cut down the gunwale with the axe right to the water 's edge before thirst and hunger rob me of my strength . By all the saints and devils I shall let the sea have the treasure rather than give it up to any stranger . Since it was the good pleasure of the Caballeros to send me off on such an errand , they shall learn I am just the man they take me for . "
96024	96043	96044	96044	he	257	" I am sure they did n't mean you to take such a desperate view of this affair , "
96047	96057	96059	96060	the man	543	" What was it , then ? A joke ? "
96079	96084	96059	96060	the man	543	" Foreman of the wharf "
96092	96135	96059	96060	the man	543	" Was it for a joke they woke me up from my sleep after two days of street fighting to make me stake my life upon a bad card ? Everybody knows , too , that I am not a lucky gambler . "
96136	96150	96151	96151	Decoud	257	" Yes , everybody knows of your good luck with women , Capataz , "
96160	96166	96151	96151	Decoud	257	" Look here , senor , "
96171	96421	96167	96167	Nostromo	251	" I never even remonstrated about this affair . Directly I heard what was wanted I saw what a desperate affair it must be , and I made up my mind to see it out . Every minute was of importance . I had to wait for you first . Then , when we arrived at the Italia Una , old Giorgio shouted to me to go for the English doctor . Later on , that poor dying woman wanted to see me , as you know . Senor , I was reluctant to go . I felt already this cursed silver growing heavy upon my back , and I was afraid that , knowing herself to be dying , she would ask me to ride off again for a priest . Father Corbelan , who is fearless , would have come at a word ; but Father Corbelan is far away , safe with the band of Hernandez , and the populace , that would have liked to tear him to pieces , are much incensed against the priests . Not a single fat padre would have consented to put his head out of his hiding - place to - night to save a Christian soul , except , perhaps , under my protection . That was in her mind . I pretended I did not believe she was going to die . Senor , I refused to fetch a priest for a dying woman . . . . "
96428	96434	96435	96435	he	257	" You did , Capataz ! "
96442	96453	96438	96438	His	257	" Well , you know - it was rather fine . "
96454	96537	96538	96538	Decoud	257	" You do not believe in priests , Don Martin ? Neither do I. What was the use of wasting time ? But she - she believes in them . The thing sticks in my throat . She may be dead already , and here we are floating helpless with no wind at all . Curse on all superstition . She died thinking I deprived her of Paradise , I suppose . It shall be the most desperate affair of my life . "
96567	96674	96561	96562	the Capataz	251	" Now , Don Martin , let us take up the sweeps and try to find the Isabels . It is either that or sinking the lighter if the day overtakes us . We must not forget that the steamer from Esmeralda with the soldiers may be coming along . We will pull straight on now . I have discovered a bit of a candle here , and we must take the risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass . There is not enough wind to blow it out - may the curse of Heaven fall upon this blind gulf ! "
96929	96932	96934	96934	Nostromo	251	" Caramba ! "
96955	96967	96968	96968	Decoud	257	" What is it ? Are you distressed , Don Martin ? "
97032	97035	97036	97036	he	257	" Senor , "
97042	97055	97036	97036	he	257	" I am certain that there is somebody weeping in this lighter . "
97079	97085	97087	97087	Nostromo	251	" It is most amazing , "
97089	97106	97087	97087	Nostromo	251	" Could anybody have concealed himself on board while the lighter was lying alongside the wharf ? "
97107	97116	97121	97121	his	257	" And you say it was like sobbing ? "
97126	97142	97121	97121	his	257	" If he is weeping , whoever he is he can not be very dangerous . "
97870	97874	97864	97866	someone on guard	2891	" Quien vive ? "
97904	97922	97898	97898	He	2865	" Here is one of those wounded rascals crawling about . Shall I go and finish him ? "
98269	98272	98273	98273	he	2865	" Water , "
98412	98447	98405	98405	Nostromo	251	" Lie still there ! Do not move a limb . If I hear as much as a loud breath from you I shall come over there and put a bullet through your head . "
98539	98553	98555	98555	Nostromo	251	" I would think twice before getting rid of a piece of wood , "
98559	98651	98555	98555	Nostromo	251	" Something may happen unexpectedly where you could make use of it . But in an affair like ours a man like this ought to be thrown overboard . Even if he were as brave as a lion we would not want him here . We are not running away for our lives . Senor , there is no harm in a brave man trying to save himself with ingenuity and courage ; but you have heard his tale , Don Martin . His being here is a miracle of fear - "
98655	98666	98667	98667	he	251	" There is no room for fear in this lighter , "
99065	99069	99071	99071	Decoud	257	" I wonder , "
99073	99084	99071	99071	Decoud	257	" how he would behave if I were not here . "
99091	99176	99177	99177	He	257	" No ! there is no room for fear on this lighter . Courage itself does not seem good enough . I have a good eye and a steady hand ; no man can say he ever saw me tired or uncertain what to do ; but por Dios , Don Martin , I have been sent out into this black calm on a business where neither a good eye , nor a steady hand , nor judgment are any use . . . . "
99191	99202	99177	99177	He	257	" Nothing but sheer desperation will do for this affair . "
99341	99352	99353	99353	he	257	" I fancy I hear another shower on the water , "
99362	99371	99353	99353	he	257	" I hope it will catch us up . "
99378	99384	99385	99385	he	257	" You hear another shower ? "
99660	99671	99673	99673	Decoud	257	" They are trying to make out where they are , "
99690	99697	99698	99698	he	257	" We are moving quite smartly , "
99702	99711	99713	99714	the Capataz	251	" We seem to be crossing her bows , "
99720	99745	99713	99714	the Capataz	251	" But this is a blind game with death . Moving on is of no use . We must n't be seen or heard . "
99775	99814	99768	99768	His	257	" That is the only way to save this treasure from this steamer full of soldiers . Any other would have carried lights . But you observe there is not a gleam to show us where she is . "
100078	100093	100094	100094	He	257	" Administration of the San Tome Silver Mine . Sulaco . Republic of Costaguana . "
100291	100298	100299	100300	the Capataz	251	" The darkness is our friend , "
100306	100373	100374	100374	He	257	" I am going to lower the sail , and trust our escape to this black gulf . No eyes could make us out lying silent with a naked mast . I will do it now , before this steamer closes still more upon us . The faint creak of a block would betray us and the San Tome treasure into the hands of those thieves . "
100434	100450	100452	100453	the Capataz	251	" You had better not move at all from where you are , Don Martin , "
100457	100492	100493	100493	he	257	" You might stumble or displace something which would make a noise . The sweeps and the punting poles are lying about . Move not for your life . Por Dios , Don Martin , "
100503	100540	100493	100493	he	257	" I am so desperate that if I did n't know your worship to be a man of courage , capable of standing stock still whatever happens , I would drive my knife into your heart . "
100604	100611	100612	100612	Decoud	257	" Perhaps you would , Capataz , "
100618	100654	100612	100612	Decoud	257	" However , you need not trouble . There are other things than the fear of your knife to keep my heart steady . It shall not betray you . Only , have you forgotten - "
100655	100670	100672	100673	the Capataz	251	" I spoke to you openly as to a man as desperate as myself , "
100675	100887	100672	100673	the Capataz	251	" The silver must be saved from the Monterists . I told Captain Mitchell three times that I preferred to go alone . I told Don Carlos Gould , too . It was in the Casa Gould . They had sent for me . The ladies were there ; and when I tried to explain why I did not wish to have you with me , they promised me , both of them , great rewards for your safety . A strange way to talk to a man you are sending out to an almost certain death . Those gentlefolk do not seem to have sense enough to understand what they are giving one to do . I told them I could do nothing for you . You would have been safer with the bandit Hernandez . It would have been possible to ride out of the town with no greater risk than a chance shot sent after you in the dark . But it was as if they had been deaf . I had to promise I would wait for you under the harbour gate . I did wait . And now because you are a brave man you are as safe as the silver . Neither more nor less . "
100955	100966	100968	100968	Nostromo	251	" They are trying for a sight of the Isabels , "
100970	101106	100968	100968	Nostromo	251	" in order to make for the harbour in a straight line and seize the Custom House with the treasure in it . Have you ever seen the Commandant of Esmeralda , Sotillo ? A handsome fellow , with a soft voice . When I first came here I used to see him in the Calle talking to the senoritas at the windows of the houses , and showing his white teeth all the time . But one of my Cargadores , who had been a soldier , told me that he had once ordered a man to be flayed alive in the remote Campo , where he was sent recruiting amongst the people of the Estancias . It has never entered his head that the Compania had a man capable of baffling his game . "
101134	101142	101143	101143	he	257	" Sotillo is not baffled so far , "
101146	101155	101143	101143	he	257	" Have you forgotten that crazy man forward ? "
101267	101276	101277	101277	Nostromo	251	" I have an axe in my hand , "
101282	101328	101277	101277	Nostromo	251	" that in three strokes would cut through the side down to the water 's edge . Moreover , each lighter has a plug in the stern , and I know exactly where it is . I feel it under the sole of my foot . "
101530	101551	101552	101552	He	251	" True , true ! You are a politician , senor . Rejoin the army , and start another revolution . "
101739	101748	101749	101750	the Capataz	251	" Something sudden may overwhelm us , senor , "
101863	101872	101873	101873	he	257	" Like a wall , like a wall , "
102096	102111	102112	102112	he	412	" I wish , Capataz , you had not let the right moment pass , "
102115	102254	102112	102112	he	412	" What ! To silence him for ever ? I thought it good to hear first how he came to be here . It was too strange . Who could imagine that it was all an accident ? Afterwards , senor , when I saw you giving him water to drink , I could not do it . Not after I had seen you holding up the can to his lips as though he were your brother . Senor , that sort of necessity must not be thought of too long . And yet it would have been no cruelty to take away from him his wretched life . It is nothing but fear . Your compassion saved him then , Don Martin , and now it is too late . It could n't be done without noise . "
102712	102739	102740	102740	he	442	" Look , miserable shopkeeper ! How can a man like me fail with any woman , let alone an emancipated girl living in scandalous freedom ? "
103018	103049	103006	103006	Barrios	373	" Oh , let Sotillo go . He is a very good man to keep guard over the cable , and the ladies of Esmeralda ought to have their turn . "
104069	104077	104078	104078	he	3072	" Aha ! I have unmasked you , "
104083	104189	104078	104078	he	3072	" You are tearing your hair from despair at my acuteness . Am I a child to believe that a light in that brass box can show you where the harbour is ? I am an old soldier , I am . I can smell a traitor a league off . You wanted that gleam to betray our approach to your friend the Englishman . A thing like that show you the way ! What a miserable lie ! Que picardia ! You Sulaco people are all in the pay of those foreigners . You deserve to be run through the body with my sword . "
104205	104225	104078	104078	he	3072	" No , no ! This is an appliance of the mariners , major . This is no treachery . "
104244	104253	104254	104254	he	3079	" Put an end to me at once , "
104490	104511	104512	104512	he	442	" If your eyes are of no more use to you than this , I shall have them put out , "
104680	104692	104693	104693	he	442	" No , not even if they rubbed sides with us , "
105387	105401	105377	105378	the Capataz	251	" Silence , for your life ! Silence ! The steamer has stopped . "
105420	105425	105426	105426	he	251	" Are we sinking ? "
105433	105439	105426	105426	he	251	" I do n't know , "
105446	105455	105440	105440	Nostromo	251	" Senor , make not the slightest sound . "
105631	105635	105628	105628	His	412	" Save me ! "
105927	105932	105920	105920	they	3127	" Impossible ! impossible ! "
105945	105954	105955	105955	he	6798	" I told you ; I told you , "
105958	105971	105955	105955	he	6798	" I could smell some treachery , some diableria a league off . "
106663	106666	106667	106667	Nostromo	251	" Yes , "
106670	106683	106684	106684	He	251	" I never forget a place I have carefully looked at once . "
106788	106798	106799	106799	he	251	" You never know what may be of use , "
106810	106824	106799	106799	he	251	" I spent a whole miserable Sunday in exploring this crumb of land . "
106825	106832	106834	106834	Decoud	257	" A misanthropic sort of occupation , "
106838	106865	106834	106834	Decoud	257	" You had no money , I suppose , to gamble with , and to fling about amongst the girls in your usual haunts , Capataz . "
106866	106870	106872	106873	the Capataz	2385	" E vero ! "
106888	107157	106872	106873	the Capataz	2385	" I had not ! Therefore I did not want to go amongst those beggarly people accustomed to my generosity . It is looked for from the Capataz of the Cargadores , who are the rich men , and , as it were , the Caballeros amongst the common people . I do n't care for cards but as a pastime ; and as to those girls that boast of having opened their doors to my knock , you know I would n't look at any one of them twice except for what the people would say . They are queer , the good people of Sulaco , and I have got much useful information simply by listening patiently to the talk of the women that everybody believed I was in love with . Poor Teresa could never understand that . On that particular Sunday , senor , she scolded so that I went out of the house swearing that I would never darken their door again unless to fetch away my hammock and my chest of clothes . Senor , there is nothing more exasperating than to hear a woman you respect rail against your good reputation when you have not a single brass coin in your pocket . I untied one of the small boats and pulled myself out of the harbour with nothing but three cigars in my pocket to help me spend the day on this island . But the water of this rivulet you hear under your feet is cool and sweet and good , senor , both before and after a smoke . "
107169	107292	107293	107293	He	3156	" That was the first Sunday after I brought down the white - whiskered English rico all the way down the mountains from the Paramo on the top of the Entrada Pass - and in the coach , too ! No coach had gone up or down that mountain road within the memory of man , senor , till I brought this one down in charge of fifty peons working like one man with ropes , pickaxes , and poles under my direction . That was the rich Englishman who , as people say , pays for the making of this railway . He was very pleased with me . But my wages were not due till the end of the month . "
107797	107813	107819	107819	he	251	" Besides , who would think of looking either for you or the treasure here ? "
107829	108061	108062	108062	he	3193	" Nobody is ever likely to come here . What could any man want with this piece of earth as long as there is room for his feet on the mainland ! The people in this country are not curious . There are even no fishermen here to intrude upon your worship . All the fishing that is done in the gulf goes on near Zapiga , over there . Senor , if you are forced to leave this island before anything can be arranged for you , do not try to make for Zapiga . It is a settlement of thieves and matreros , where they would cut your throat promptly for the sake of your gold watch and chain . And , senor , think twice before confiding in any one whatever ; even in the officers of the Company 's steamers , if you ever get on board one . Honesty alone is not enough for security . You must look to discretion and prudence in a man . And always remember , senor , before you open your lips for a confidence , that this treasure may be left safely here for hundreds of years . Time is on its side , senor . And silver is an incorruptible metal that can be trusted to keep its value for ever . . . . An incorruptible metal , "
108076	108085	108086	108086	Decoud	257	" As some men are said to be , "
108188	108194	108195	108195	he	3193	" Have you any message ? "
108202	108211	108195	108195	he	3193	" Remember , I shall be asked questions . "
108212	108245	108164	108164	Nostromo	251	" You must find the hopeful words that ought to be spoken to the people in town . I trust for that your intelligence and your experience , Capataz . You understand ? "
108246	108258	108195	108195	he	3193	" Si , senor . . . . For the ladies . "
108259	108264	108266	108266	Decoud	257	" Yes , yes , "
108270	108296	108297	108297	he	3193	" Your wonderful reputation will make them attach great value to your words ; therefore be careful what you say . I am looking forward , "
108316	108387	108297	108297	he	3193	" I am looking forward to a glorious and successful ending to my mission . Do you hear , Capataz ? Use the words glorious and successful when you speak to the senorita . Your own mission is accomplished gloriously and successfully . You have indubitably saved the silver of the mine . Not only this silver , but probably all the silver that shall ever come out of it . "
108394	108403	108404	108404	he	3193	" I dare say , Senor Don Martin , "
108409	108477	108404	108404	he	3193	" There are very few things that I am not equal to . Ask the foreign signori . I , a man of the people , who can not always understand what you mean . But as to this lot which I must leave here , let me tell you that I would believe it in greater safety if you had not been with me at all . "
108489	108499	108500	108500	he	3193	" Shall I go back with you to Sulaco ? "
108507	108520	108522	108522	Nostromo	251	" Shall I strike you dead with my knife where you stand ? "
108526	108587	108522	108522	Nostromo	251	" It would be the same thing as taking you to Sulaco . Come , senor . Your reputation is in your politics , and mine is bound up with the fate of this silver . Do you wonder I wish there had been no other man to share my knowledge ? I wanted no one with me , senor . "
108588	108600	108601	108601	Decoud	257	" You could not have kept the lighter afloat without me , "
108605	108616	108601	108601	Decoud	257	" You would have gone to the bottom with her . "
108617	108620	108622	108622	Nostromo	251	" Yes , "
108626	108629	108622	108622	Nostromo	251	" alone . "
108734	108744	108745	108745	he	257	" What do you think has become of Hirsch ? "
108748	108754	108756	108756	Nostromo	251	" Knocked overboard and drowned , "
108773	108796	108756	108756	Nostromo	251	" Keep close in the ravine , senor . I shall try to come out to you in a night or two . "
109750	109753	109703	109704	Italian workmen	5783	" three days "
109915	109920	109897	109897	Their	3231	" Albergo d'ltalia Una , "
110013	110021	110023	110024	the doctor	6199	" Withdrawing your people from the harbour ? "
110083	110097	110099	110100	the engineer	6138	" As quick as I can . We are not a political faction , "
110104	110127	110099	110100	the engineer	6138	" And we are not going to give our new rulers a handle against the railway . You approve me , Gould ? "
110128	110131	110133	110134	Charles Gould	250	" Absolutely , "
110426	110438	110439	110441	the chief engineer	6162	" I have misled them a little as to the time , "
110444	110571	110439	110441	the chief engineer	6162	" However hard he rides , he can scarcely get here before the morning . But my object is attained . I 've secured several hours ' peace for the losing party . But I did not tell them anything about Sotillo , for fear they would take it into their heads to try to get hold of the harbour again , either to oppose him or welcome him - there 's no saying which . There was Gould 's silver , on which rests the remnant of our hopes . Decoud 's retreat had to be thought of , too . I think the railway has done pretty well by its friends without compromising itself hopelessly . Now the parties must be left to themselves . "
110572	110578	110580	110581	the doctor	6199	" Costaguana for the Costaguaneros , "
110585	110615	110580	110581	the doctor	6199	" It is a fine country , and they have raised a fine crop of hates , vengeance , murder , and rapine - those sons of the country . "
110616	110625	110626	110627	Charles Gould	250	" Well , I am one of them , "
110634	110659	110626	110627	Charles Gould	250	" and I must be going on to see to my own crop of trouble . My wife has driven straight on , doctor ? "
110660	110680	110626	110627	Charles Gould	250	" Yes . All was quiet on this side . Mrs. Gould has taken the two girls with her . "
110698	110705	110706	110706	he	6199	" That man is calmness personified , "
110731	110740	110706	110706	he	6199	" He must be extremely sure of himself . "
110741	110758	110760	110761	the doctor	6199	" If that 's all he is sure of , then he is sure of nothing , "
110793	110807	110775	110775	He	6199	" It is the last thing a man ought to be sure of . "
110883	110903	110880	110880	he	6133	" I really do n't see that . For me there seems to be nothing else . However - - "
111777	111782	111783	111783	he	6133	" Poor old chap ! "
111797	111816	111783	111783	he	6133	" He 'll never be able to keep the place going by himself . I shall be sorry . "
111817	111825	111834	111834	his	421	" He 's quite alone up there , "
111842	111934	111834	111834	his	421	" Every living soul has cleared out , and Mrs. Gould took the girls away just now . It might not be over - safe for them out here before very long . Of course , as a doctor I can do nothing more here ; but she has asked me to stay with old Viola , and as I have no horse to get back to the mine , where I ought to be , I made no difficulty to stay . They can do without me in the town . "
111935	111961	111963	111968	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" I have a good mind to remain with you , doctor , till we see whether anything happens to - night at the harbour , "
111970	112029	111963	111968	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" He must not be molested by Sotillo 's soldiery , who may push on as far as this at once . Sotillo used to be very cordial to me at the Goulds ' and at the club . How that man'll ever dare to look any of his friends here in the face I ca n't imagine . "
112030	112048	112050	112051	the doctor	6199	" He 'll no doubt begin by shooting some of them to get over the first awkwardness , "
112053	112073	112074	112074	He	6133	" Nothing in this country serves better your military man who has changed sides than a few summary executions . "
112108	112202	112098	112098	He	6133	" I think we shall be able to mount you in the morning , doctor . Our peons have recovered some of our stampeded horses . By riding hard and taking a wide circuit by Los Hatos and along the edge of the forest , clear of Rincon altogether , you may hope to reach the San Tome bridge without being interfered with . The mine is just now , to my mind , the safest place for anybody at all compromised . I only wish the railway was as difficult to touch . "
112203	112208	111963	111968	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Am I compromised ? "
112219	112750	112209	112210	Doctor Monygham	421	" The whole Gould Concession is compromised . It could not have remained for ever outside the political life of the country - if those convulsions may be called life . The thing is - can it be touched ? The moment was bound to come when neutrality would become impossible , and Charles Gould understood this well . I believe he is prepared for every extremity . A man of his sort has never contemplated remaining indefinitely at the mercy of ignorance and corruption . It was like being a prisoner in a cavern of banditti with the price of your ransom in your pocket , and buying your life from day to day . Your mere safety , not your liberty , mind , doctor . I know what I am talking about . The image at which you shrug your shoulders is perfectly correct , especially if you conceive such a prisoner endowed with the power of replenishing his pocket by means as remote from the faculties of his captors as if they were magic . You must have understood that as well as I do , doctor . He was in the position of the goose with the golden eggs . I broached this matter to him as far back as Sir John 's visit here . The prisoner of stupid and greedy banditti is always at the mercy of the first imbecile ruffian , who may blow out his brains in a fit of temper or for some prospect of an immediate big haul . The tale of killing the goose with the golden eggs has not been evolved for nothing out of the wisdom of mankind . It is a story that will never grow old . That is why Charles Gould in his deep , dumb way has countenanced the Ribierist Mandate , the first public act that promised him safety on other than venal grounds . Ribierism has failed , as everything merely rational fails in this country . But Gould remains logical in wishing to save this big lot of silver . Decoud 's plan of a counter - revolution may be practicable or not , it may have a chance , or it may not have a chance . With all my experience of this revolutionary continent , I can hardly yet look at their methods seriously . Decoud has been reading to us his draft of a proclamation , and talking very well for two hours about his plan of action . He had arguments which should have appeared solid enough if we , members of old , stable political and national organizations , were not startled by the mere idea of a new State evolved like this out of the head of a scoffing young man fleeing for his life , with a proclamation in his pocket , to a rough , jeering , half - bred swashbuckler , who in this part of the world is called a general . It sounds like a comic fairy tale - and behold , it may come off ; because it is true to the very spirit of the country . "
112751	112760	112762	112763	the doctor	6199	" Is the silver gone off , then ? "
112775	112826	112767	112769	The chief engineer	6162	" By Captain Mitchell 's reckoning - and he ought to know - it has been gone long enough now to be some three or four miles outside the harbour ; and , as Mitchell says , Nostromo is the sort of seaman to make the best of his opportunities . "
112840	113032	112828	112829	the doctor	6199	" You have a poor opinion of that move , doctor ? But why ? Charles Gould has got to play his game out , though he is not the man to formulate his conduct even to himself , perhaps , let alone to others . It may be that the game has been partly suggested to him by Holroyd ; but it accords with his character , too ; and that is why it has been so successful . Have n't they come to calling him ' El Rey de Sulaco ' in Sta . Marta ? A nickname may be the best record of a success . That 's what I call putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth . My dear sir , when I first arrived in Sta . Marta I was struck by the way all those journalists , demagogues , members of Congress , and all those generals and judges cringed before a sleepy - eyed advocate without practice simply because he was the plenipotentiary of the Gould Concession . Sir John when he came out was impressed , too . "
113033	113050	113052	113053	Dr. Monygham	249	" A new State , with that plump dandy , Decoud , for the first President , "
113066	113075	113076	113078	the chief engineer	6162	" Upon my word , and why not ? "
113107	113110	113114	113114	he	6162	" pronunciamientos . "
113272	113285	113286	113286	he	6199	" This Decoud , I see , is a persuasive young beggar , "
113291	113321	113286	113286	he	6199	" And pray is it for this , then , that Charles Gould has let the whole lot of ingots go out to sea in charge of that Nostromo ? "
113322	113326	113328	113333	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Charles Gould , "
113335	113667	113328	113333	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" has said no more about his motive than usual . You know , he does n't talk . But we all here know his motive , and he has only one - the safety of the San Tome mine with the preservation of the Gould Concession in the spirit of his compact with Holroyd . Holroyd is another uncommon man . They understand each other 's imaginative side . One is thirty , the other nearly sixty , and they have been made for each other . To be a millionaire , and such a millionaire as Holroyd , is like being eternally young . The audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal ; but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand - which is better . One 's time on earth is an uncertain quantity , but about the long reach of millions there is no doubt . The introduction of a pure form of Christianity into this continent is a dream for a youthful enthusiast , and I have been trying to explain to you why Holroyd at fifty - eight is like a man on the threshold of life , and better , too . He 's not a missionary , but the San Tome mine holds just that for him . I assure you , in sober truth , that he could not manage to keep this out of a strictly business conference upon the finances of Costaguana he had with Sir John a couple of years ago . Sir John mentioned it with amazement in a letter he wrote to me here , from San Francisco , when on his way home . Upon my word , doctor , things seem to be worth nothing by what they are in themselves . I begin to believe that the only solid thing about them is the spiritual value which everyone discovers in his own form of activity - - "
113668	113671	113673	113674	the doctor	6199	" Bah ! "
113689	113731	113673	113674	the doctor	6199	" Self - flattery . Food for that vanity which makes the world go round . Meantime , what do you think is going to happen to the treasure floating about the gulf with the great Capataz and the great politician ? "
113732	113742	113328	113333	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" Why are you uneasy about it , doctor ? "
113743	113841	113328	113333	the engineer - in - chief	6133	" I uneasy ! And what the devil is it to me ? I put no spiritual value into my desires , or my opinions , or my actions . They have not enough vastness to give me room for self - flattery . Look , for instance , I should certainly have liked to ease the last moments of that poor woman . And I ca n't . It 's impossible . Have you met the impossible face to face - or have you , the Napoleon of railways , no such word in your dictionary ? "
113842	113855	113857	113859	the chief engineer	6162	" Is she bound to have a very bad time of it ? "
113963	113982	113958	113958	his	6199	" Yes , she 's bound to . And I could do nothing if I went up now . "
113993	113997	113999	114000	the engineer	6138	" I fancy , "
114007	114016	113999	114000	the engineer	6138	" that you mistrust Captain Mitchell 's Capataz . "
114017	114021	114023	114024	the doctor	6199	" Mistrust him ! "
114029	114124	114127	114128	the doctor	6199	" I believe him capable of anything - even of the most absurd fidelity . I am the last person he spoke to before he left the wharf , you know . The poor woman up there wanted to see him , and I let him go up to her . The dying must not be contradicted , you know . She seemed then fairly calm and resigned , but the scoundrel in those ten minutes or so has done or said something which seems to have driven her into despair . You know , "
114132	114390	114127	114128	the doctor	6199	" women are so very unaccountable in every position , and at all times of life , that I thought sometimes she was in a way , do n't you see ? in love with him - the Capataz . The rascal has his own charm indubitably , or he would not have made the conquest of all the populace of the town . No , no , I am not absurd . I may have given a wrong name to some strong sentiment for him on her part , to an unreasonable and simple attitude a woman is apt to take up emotionally towards a man . She used to abuse him to me frequently , which , of course , is not inconsistent with my idea . Not at all . It looked to me as if she were always thinking of him . He was something important in her life . You know , I have seen a lot of those people . Whenever I came down from the mine Mrs. Gould used to ask me to keep my eye on them . She likes Italians ; she has lived a long time in Italy , I believe , and she took a special fancy to that old Garibaldino . A remarkable chap enough . A rugged and dreamy character , living in the republicanism of his young days as if in a cloud . He has encouraged much of the Capataz 's confounded nonsense - the high - strung , exalted old beggar ! "
114391	114397	114399	114401	the chief engineer	6162	" What sort of nonsense ? "
114403	114547	114399	114401	the chief engineer	6162	" I found the Capataz always a very shrewd and sensible fellow , absolutely fearless , and remarkably useful . A perfect handy man . Sir John was greatly impressed by his resourcefulness and attention when he made that overland journey from Sta . Marta . Later on , as you might have heard , he rendered us a service by disclosing to the then chief of police the presence in the town of some professional thieves , who came from a distance to wreck and rob our monthly pay train . He has certainly organized the lighterage service of the harbour for the O.S.N. Company with great ability . He knows how to make himself obeyed , foreigner though he is . It is true that the Cargadores are strangers here , too , for the most part - immigrants , Islenos . "
114548	114555	114557	114558	the doctor	6199	" His prestige is his fortune , "
114562	114583	114585	114586	the engineer	6138	" The man has proved his trustworthiness up to the hilt on innumerable occasions and in all sorts of ways , "
114588	114738	114585	114586	the engineer	6138	" When this question of the silver arose , Captain Mitchell naturally was very warmly of the opinion that his Capataz was the only man fit for the trust . As a sailor , of course , I suppose so . But as a man , do n't you know , Gould , Decoud , and myself judged that it did n't matter in the least who went . Any boatman would have done just as well . Pray , what could a thief do with such a lot of ingots ? If he ran off with them he would have in the end to land somewhere , and how could he conceal his cargo from the knowledge of the people ashore ? We dismissed that consideration from our minds . Moreover , Decoud was going . There have been occasions when the Capataz has been more implicitly trusted . "
114739	114747	114748	114749	the doctor	6199	" He took a slightly different view , "
114752	115064	114748	114749	the doctor	6199	" I heard him declare in this very room that it would be the most desperate affair of his life . He made a sort of verbal will here in my hearing , appointing old Viola his executor ; and , by Jove ! do you know , he - he 's not grown rich by his fidelity to you good people of the railway and the harbour . I suppose he obtains some - how do you say that ? - some spiritual value for his labours , or else I do n't know why the devil he should be faithful to you , Gould , Mitchell , or anybody else . He knows this country well . He knows , for instance , that Gamacho , the Deputy from Javira , has been nothing else but a ' tramposo ' of the commonest sort , a petty pedlar of the Campo , till he managed to get enough goods on credit from Anzani to open a little store in the wilds , and got himself elected by the drunken mozos that hang about the Estancias and the poorest sort of rancheros who were in his debt . And Gamacho , who to - morrow will be probably one of our high officials , is a stranger , too - an Isleno . He might have been a Cargador on the O. S. N. wharf had he not the posadero of Rincon is ready to swear it murdered a pedlar in the woods and stolen his pack to begin life on . And do you think that Gamacho , then , would have ever become a hero with the democracy of this place , like our Capataz ? Of course not . He is n't half the man . No ; decidedly , I think that Nostromo is a fool . "
115077	115086	115087	115087	he	6199	" It is impossible to argue that point , "
115092	115255	115256	115256	He	3400	" Each man has his gifts . You should have heard Gamacho haranguing his friends in the street . He has a howling voice , and he shouted like mad , lifting his clenched fist right above his head , and throwing his body half out of the window . At every pause the rabble below yelled , ' Down with the Oligarchs ! Viva la Libertad ! ' Fuentes inside looked extremely miserable . You know , he is the brother of Jorge Fuentes , who has been Minister of the Interior for six months or so , some few years back . Of course , he has no conscience ; but he is a man of birth and education - at one time the director of the Customs of Cayta . That idiot - brute Gamacho fastened himself upon him with his following of the lowest rabble . His sickly fear of that ruffian was the most rejoicing sight imaginable . "
115271	115275	115276	115276	he	3400	" All quiet , "
115279	115291	115276	115276	he	3400	" I wonder if Sotillo really means to turn up here ? "
115492	115499	115500	115500	he	267	" His Excellency Don Vincente Ribiera , "
115505	115550	115500	115500	he	267	" whom I and that fellow of mine , Nostromo , had the honour , sir , and the pleasure of saving from a cruel death , deferred too much to his Congress . It was a mistake - a distinct mistake , sir . "
115629	115649	115706	115706	he	267	" One would not have believed it possible ; but so it was , sir . A full fortnight . "
115693	115704	115706	115706	he	267	" in the thick of things from first to last . "
115723	115726	115706	115706	he	267	" his fellow "
115809	115815	115816	115816	he	267	" A feeling , sir , "
115819	116540	115816	115816	he	267	" perfectly comprehensible in a man properly grateful for the many kindnesses received from the best families of merchants and other native gentlemen of independent means , who , barely saved by us from the excesses of the mob , seemed , to my mind 's eye , destined to become the prey in person and fortune of the native soldiery , which , as is well known , behave with regrettable barbarity to the inhabitants during their civil commotions . And then , sir , there were the Goulds , for both of whom , man and wife , I could not but entertain the warmest feelings deserved by their hospitality and kindness . I felt , too , the dangers of the gentlemen of the Amarilla Club , who had made me honorary member , and had treated me with uniform regard and civility , both in my capacity of Consular Agent and as Superintendent of an important Steam Service . Miss Antonia Avellanos , the most beautiful and accomplished young lady whom it had ever been my privilege to speak to , was not a little in my mind , I confess . How the interests of my Company would be affected by the impending change of officials claimed a large share of my attention , too . In short , sir , I was extremely anxious and very tired , as you may suppose , by the exciting and memorable events in which I had taken my little part . The Company 's building containing my residence was within five minutes ' walk , with the attraction of some supper and of my hammock I always take my nightly rest in a hammock , as the most suitable to the climate ; but somehow , sir , though evidently I could do nothing for any one by remaining about , I could not tear myself away from that wharf , where the fatigue made me stumble painfully at times . The night was excessively dark - the darkest I remember in my life ; so that I began to think that the arrival of the transport from Esmeralda could not possibly take place before daylight , owing to the difficulty of navigating the gulf . The mosquitoes bit like fury . We have been infested here with mosquitoes before the late improvements ; a peculiar harbour brand , sir , renowned for its ferocity . They were like a cloud about my head , and I should n't wonder that but for their attacks I would have dozed off as I walked up and down , and got a heavy fall . I kept on smoking cigar after cigar , more to protect myself from being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the weed . Then , sir , when perhaps for the twentieth time I was approaching my watch to the lighted end in order to see the time , and observing with surprise that it wanted yet ten minutes to midnight , I heard the splash of a ship 's propeller - an unmistakable sound to a sailor 's ear on such a calm night . It was faint indeed , because they were advancing with precaution and dead slow , both on account of the darkness and from their desire of not revealing too soon their presence : a very unnecessary care , because , I verily believe , in all the enormous extent of this harbour I was the only living soul about . Even the usual staff of watchmen and others had been absent from their posts for several nights owing to the disturbances . I stood stock still , after dropping and stamping out my cigar - a circumstance highly agreeable , I should think , to the mosquitoes , if I may judge from the state of my face next morning . But that was a trifling inconvenience in comparison with the brutal proceedings I became victim of on the part of Sotillo . Something utterly inconceivable , sir ; more like the proceedings of a maniac than the action of a sane man , however lost to all sense of honour and decency . But Sotillo was furious at the failure of his thievish scheme . "
116887	116897	116908	116909	Captain Mitchell	267	" Push that railway car out of the way ! "
116957	116969	116971	116974	one of his captors	3443	" We have caught a man hiding here , mi teniente ! "
116976	116988	116990	116991	the voice	3445	" Hold him on one side till the rearguard comes along , "
118074	118081	118082	118082	he	442	" Let him be brought in , "
118246	118254	118255	118255	he	3061	" What ! The excellent Senor Mitchell ! "
118274	118281	118255	118255	he	3061	" Release the caballero at once , "
118333	118341	118342	118342	he	442	" Go out , all of you , "
118462	118476	118477	118477	he	267	" I 've been knocked down three times between this and the wharf , "
118483	118493	118477	118477	he	267	" Somebody shall be made to pay for this . "
118559	118575	118528	118528	He	267	" Look ! Those uniformed thieves of yours downstairs have robbed me of my watch . "
118602	118609	118610	118610	Mitchell	267	" I demand restitution and apologies , "
118619	118628	118617	118617	himself	267	" From you ! Yes , from you ! "
118722	118729	118730	118731	the colonel	3061	" Disarm him ! Bind him ! "
118870	118877	118879	118880	the colonel	3061	" The watch ! the watch ! "
118893	118901	118879	118880	the colonel	3061	" Give me that man 's watch . "
118983	119006	119007	119007	He	3513	" Now then ! You arrogant Englishman ! You dare to call the soldiers of the army thieves ! Behold your watch . "
119225	119228	119229	119229	he	442	" Ha ! "
119240	119283	119229	119229	he	442	" You dare call my valiant soldiers of the Esmeralda regiment , thieves . You dare ! What impudence ! You foreigners come here to rob our country of its wealth . You never have enough ! Your audacity knows no bounds . "
119306	119317	119298	119300	The older major	3525	" Si , mi colonel . They are all traitors . "
119318	119324	119326	119326	Sotillo	442	" I shall say nothing , "
119341	119387	119388	119388	He	442	" I shall say nothing of your treacherous attempt to get possession of my revolver to shoot me while I was trying to treat you with consideration you did not deserve . You have forfeited your life . Your only hope is in my clemency . "
119464	119471	119472	119472	he	442	" It is you , Mitchell , "
119477	119487	119488	119488	He	442	" who are the thief , not my soldiers ! "
119504	119601	119472	119472	he	442	" Where is the silver of the San Tome mine ? I ask you , Mitchell , where is the silver that was deposited in this Custom House ? Answer me that ! You stole it . You were a party to stealing it . It was stolen from the Government . Aha ! you think I do not know what I say ; but I am up to your foreign tricks . It is gone , the silver ! No ? Gone in one of your lanchas , you miserable man ! How dared you ? "
119609	119618	119620	119620	Mitchell	267	" How on earth could Sotillo know that ? "
119643	119649	119650	119650	Sotillo	442	" Ha ! you tremble , "
119655	119701	119650	119650	Sotillo	442	" It is a conspiracy . It is a crime against the State . Did you not know that the silver belongs to the Republic till the Government claims are satisfied ? Where is it ? Where have you hidden it , you miserable thief ? "
119799	119803	119804	119804	he	267	" That man , "
119809	119818	119804	119804	he	267	" is not certain of what he advances . "
119876	119887	119872	119872	he	267	" No doubt it is well concealed by this time . "
119898	119904	119905	119905	he	442	" Muy bien , Mitchell , "
119914	119967	119905	119905	he	442	" But can you produce the Government receipt for the royalty and the Custom House permit of embarkation , hey ? Can you ? No . Then the silver has been removed illegally , and the guilty shall be made to suffer , unless it is produced within five days from this . "
120025	120037	120038	120038	he	267	" How did you like to be tied up , Mitchell ? "
120043	120055	120056	120057	Captain Mitchell	267	" It is the most incredible , abominable use of power ! "
120064	120082	120056	120057	Captain Mitchell	267	" And whatever your purpose , you shall gain nothing from it , I can promise you . "
120126	120157	120158	120158	He	3535	" That we shall see . You shall know my power a little better when I tie you up to a potalon outside in the sun for a whole day . "
120176	120182	120184	120185	Captain Mitchell	267	" What about my watch ? "
120207	120219	120220	120220	he	442	" No ! But only listen to this picaro , caballeros , "
120236	120242	120246	120246	He	442	" He demands his watch ! "
120275	120316	120322	120323	Captain Mitchell	267	" Your watch ! You are a prisoner in war time , Mitchell ! In war time ! You have no rights and no property ! Caramba ! The very breath in your body belongs to me . Remember that . "
120317	120320	120322	120323	Captain Mitchell	267	" Bosh ! "
120551	120558	120560	120570	the chief engineer , whose single eyeglass glittered in the firelight	3555	" Is he actually keeping you ? "
120584	120593	120572	120579	An officer from the top of the stairs	3556	" Bring them all up - all three . "
120612	120623	120605	120606	Captain Mitchell	267	" By heavens ! the fellow has stolen my watch . "
120641	120649	120624	120632	The engineer - in - chief on the staircase	3557	" What ? What did you say ? "
120650	120654	120655	120656	Captain Mitchell	267	" My chronometer ! "
121141	121161	121166	121166	he	267	" How in the name of all that 's marvellous did that confounded fellow get wind of the affair ? "
121215	121222	121223	121223	he	249	" Is that you , Mitchell ? "
121229	121250	121223	121223	he	249	" I struck my forehead against this confounded wall with enough force to fell an ox . Where are you ? "
121270	121286	121287	121288	Captain Mitchell	267	" I am sitting here on the floor . Do n't fall over my legs , "
121335	121338	121339	121340	the doctor	6199	" Yes , "
121353	122122	121339	121340	the doctor	6199	" we have been nabbed in old Viola 's place . It seems that one of their pickets , commanded by an officer , pushed as far as the town gate . They had orders not to enter , but to bring along every soul they could find on the plain . We had been talking in there with the door open , and no doubt they saw the glimmer of our light . They must have been making their approaches for some time . The engineer laid himself on a bench in a recess by the fire - place , and I went upstairs to have a look . I had n't heard any sound from there for a long time . Old Viola , as soon as he saw me come up , lifted his arm for silence . I stole in on tiptoe . By Jove , his wife was lying down and had gone to sleep . The woman had actually dropped off to sleep ! ' Senor Doctor , ' Viola whispers to me , ' it looks as if her oppression was going to get better . ' ' Yes , ' I said , very much surprised ; ' your wife is a wonderful woman , Giorgio . ' Just then a shot was fired in the kitchen , which made us jump and cower as if at a thunder - clap . It seems that the party of soldiers had stolen quite close up , and one of them had crept up to the door . He looked in , thought there was no one there , and , holding his rifle ready , entered quietly . The chief told me that he had just closed his eyes for a moment . When he opened them , he saw the man already in the middle of the room peering into the dark corners . The chief was so startled that , without thinking , he made one leap from the recess right out in front of the fireplace . The soldier , no less startled , up with his rifle and pulls the trigger , deafening and singeing the engineer , but in his flurry missing him completely . But , look what happens ! At the noise of the report the sleeping woman sat up , as if moved by a spring , with a shriek , ' The children , Gian ' Battista ! Save the children ! ' I have it in my ears now . It was the truest cry of distress I ever heard . I stood as if paralyzed , but the old husband ran across to the bedside , stretching out his hands . She clung to them ! I could see her eyes go glazed ; the old fellow lowered her down on the pillows and then looked round at me . She was dead ! All this took less than five minutes , and then I ran down to see what was the matter . It was no use thinking of any resistance . Nothing we two could say availed with the officer , so I volunteered to go up with a couple of soldiers and fetch down old Viola . He was sitting at the foot of the bed , looking at his wife 's face , and did not seem to hear what I said ; but after I had pulled the sheet over her head , he got up and followed us downstairs quietly , in a sort of thoughtful way . They marched us off along the road , leaving the door open and the candle burning . The chief engineer strode on without a word , but I looked back once or twice at the feeble gleam . After we had gone some considerable distance , the Garibaldino , who was walking by my side , suddenly said , ' I have buried many men on battlefields on this continent . The priests talk of consecrated ground ! Bah ! All the earth made by God is holy ; but the sea , which knows nothing of kings and priests and tyrants , is the holiest of all . Doctor ! I should like to bury her in the sea . No mummeries , candles , incense , no holy water mumbled over by priests . The spirit of liberty is upon the waters . ' . . . Amazing old man . He was saying all this in an undertone as if talking to himself . "
122123	122128	122130	122131	Captain Mitchell	267	" Yes , yes , "
122135	122253	122130	122131	Captain Mitchell	267	" Poor old chap ! But have you any idea how that ruffian Sotillo obtained his information ? He did not get hold of any of our Cargadores who helped with the truck , did he ? But no , it is impossible ! These were picked men we 've had in our boats for these five years , and I paid them myself specially for the job , with instructions to keep out of the way for twenty - four hours at least . I saw them with my own eyes march on with the Italians to the railway yards . The chief promised to give them rations as long as they wanted to remain there . "
122254	122257	122259	122260	the doctor	6199	" Well , "
122264	122290	122259	122260	the doctor	6199	" I can tell you that you may say good - bye for ever to your best lighter , and to the Capataz of Cargadores . "
122334	122337	122338	122338	he	267	" Drowned ! "
122348	122351	122338	122338	he	267	" Drowned ! "
122646	122674	122642	122642	he	3061	" The silver might have been indeed put on board the lighter , but it was not conceivable that it should have been taken out to sea . "
122772	122780	122761	122762	The doctor	6199	" He is very capable of that . "
122793	122801	122782	122783	Captain Mitchell	267	" You said that of Charles Gould ! "
122837	122852	122853	122853	he	267	" What on earth made you say that to this watch - stealing scoundrel ? "
122856	122881	122882	122882	He	267	" What 's the object of an infernal lie of that sort ? That confounded pick - pocket was quite capable of believing you . "
122896	122907	122908	122908	he	267	" Yes , that is exactly what I did say , "
122957	122962	122963	122963	he	267	" Well , well ! "
123253	123256	123257	123264	the doctor , who had been apparently reflecting	3617	" Yes , "
123269	123329	123257	123264	the doctor , who had been apparently reflecting	3617	" he believed me right enough . I thought he would have hugged me . ' Si , si , ' he said , ' he will write to that partner of his , the rich Americano in San Francisco , that it is all lost . Why not ? There is enough to share with many people . ' "
123330	123337	123339	123340	Captain Mitchell	267	" But this is perfectly imbecile ! "
123373	123377	123378	123379	the doctor	6199	" I mentioned , "
123382	123443	123378	123379	the doctor	6199	" in a sort of casual way , that treasure is generally buried in the earth rather than set afloat upon the sea . At this my Sotillo slapped his forehead . ' Por Dios , yes , ' he said ; ' they must have buried it on the shores of this harbour somewhere before they sailed out . ' "
123444	123449	123451	123452	Captain Mitchell	267	" Heavens and earth ! "
123454	123467	123468	123468	He	267	" I should not have believed that anybody could be ass enough - "
123476	123531	123468	123468	He	267	" But what 's the good of all this ? It would have been a clever enough lie if the lighter had been still afloat . It would have kept that inconceivable idiot perhaps from sending out the steamer to cruise in the gulf . That was the danger that worried me no end . "
123537	123543	123544	123545	the doctor	6199	" I had an object , "
123550	123554	123556	123557	Captain Mitchell	267	" Had you ? "
123559	123642	123556	123557	Captain Mitchell	267	" Well , that 's lucky , or else I would have thought that you went on fooling him for the fun of the thing . And perhaps that was your object . Well , I must say I personally would n't condescend to that sort of thing . It is not to my taste . No , no . Blackening a friend 's character is not my idea of fun , if it were to fool the greatest blackguard on earth . "
123699	123703	123704	123704	he	267	" I wonder , "
123707	123740	123704	123704	he	267	" why they have shut us up together , or why Sotillo should have shut you up at all , since it seems to me you have been fairly chummy up there ? "
123741	123747	123749	123750	the doctor	6199	" Yes , I wonder , "
123819	123830	123846	123847	the doctor	6199	" What has that ruffian done with the other two ? "
123831	123844	123846	123847	the doctor	6199	" The chief engineer he would have let go in any case , "
123849	123891	123846	123847	the doctor	6199	" He would n't like to have a quarrel with the railway upon his hands . Not just yet , at any rate . I do n't think , Captain Mitchell , that you understand exactly what Sotillo 's position is - "
123892	123906	123908	123909	Captain Mitchell	267	" I do n't see why I should bother my head about it , "
123911	123914	123916	123917	the doctor	6199	" No , "
123925	123956	123916	123917	the doctor	6199	" I do n't see why you should . It would n't help a single human being in the world if you thought ever so hard upon any subject whatever . "
123957	123960	123962	123963	Captain Mitchell	267	" No , "
123972	123989	123962	123963	Captain Mitchell	267	" A man locked up in a confounded dark hole is not much use to anybody . "
123990	123996	123997	123998	the doctor	6199	" As to old Viola , "
124008	124024	123997	123998	the doctor	6199	" Sotillo released him for the same reason he is presently going to release you . "
124025	124030	124032	124033	Captain Mitchell	267	" Eh ? What ? "
124043	124081	124082	124082	he	267	" What is there in common between me and old Viola ? More likely because the old chap has no watch and chain for the pickpocket to steal . And I tell you what , Dr. Monygham , "
124089	124189	124082	124082	he	267	" he will find it more difficult than he thinks to get rid of me . He will burn his fingers over that job yet , I can tell you . To begin with , I wo n't go without my watch , and as to the rest - we shall see . I dare say it is no great matter for you to be locked up . But Joe Mitchell is a different kind of man , sir . I do n't mean to submit tamely to insult and robbery . I am a public character , sir . "
124499	124532	124485	124485	he	3061	" I have concluded not to detain you , Senor Mitchell . I am of a forgiving disposition . I make allowances . Let this be a lesson to you , however . "
124630	124650	124651	124651	He	267	" I should have thought that the feelings of a caballero would have dictated to you an appropriate reply . "
124693	124717	124724	124724	he	267	" Here , Senor Mitchell , is your watch . Learn how hasty and unjust has been your judgment of my patriotic soldiers . "
124805	124835	124800	124800	he	267	" You may go and wait downstairs for the senor doctor , whom I am going to liberate , too . You foreigners are insignificant , to my mind . "
124863	124875	124848	124849	Captain Mitchell	267	" The law shall take note later on of your transgressions , "
124880	124927	124848	124849	Captain Mitchell	267	" But as for me , you can live free , unguarded , unobserved . Do you hear , Senor Mitchell ? You may depart to your affairs . You are beneath my notice . My attention is claimed by matters of the very highest importance . "
125018	125022	125024	125024	Sotillo	442	" A brute ! "
125088	125118	125119	125120	The doctor	6199	" So your countrymen do not confide in you very much , senor doctor . They do not love you , eh ? Why is that , I wonder ? "
125137	125148	125123	125123	his	6199	" Perhaps because I have lived too long in Costaguana . "
125161	125169	125170	125170	he	6199	" Aha ! But you love yourself , "
125175	125182	125183	125184	the doctor	6199	" If you leave them alone , "
125199	125218	125183	125184	the doctor	6199	" they will betray themselves very soon . Meantime , I may try to make Don Carlos speak ? "
125219	125225	125227	125227	Sotillo	442	" Ah ! senor doctor , "
125233	125250	125230	125230	his	442	" you are a man of quick intelligence . We were made to understand each other . "
125614	125627	125628	125628	he	442	" An army - an army crossed the mountains under Pedrito already , "
125638	125665	125628	125628	he	442	" If it had not been that I am given the news by a man of your position I would never have believed it . Astonishing ! "
125666	125671	125673	125674	the engineer	6138	" An armed force , "
126408	126415	126398	126398	His	6706	" Which is the Casa Avellanos ? "
126732	126744	126746	126747	Father Corbelan	411	" Heaven itself wills it . Providence is on our side , "
127050	127081	127035	127035	he	389	" Caballeros , a moment of silence ! A moment of silence ! We ought to make it clear that we bow in all good faith to the accomplished facts . "
127466	127470	127472	127473	Mrs. Gould	248	" Drive carefully , "
127479	127487	127488	127488	he	374	" Si , carefully ; si nina , "
127511	127522	127524	127525	Charles Gould	250	" I will see them as far as the ford , "
127771	127774	127775	127775	he	250	" Caballero , "
127782	127805	127775	127775	he	250	" you are he whom they call the King of Sulaco , the master of the mine ? Is it not so ? "
127806	127817	127819	127820	Charles Gould	250	" Yes , I am the master of the mine , "
127834	127936	127937	127937	he	3823	" I have a brother , a sereno in your service in the San Tome valley . You have proved yourself a just man . There has been no wrong done to any one since you called upon the people to work in the mountains . My brother says that no official of the Government , no oppressor of the Campo , has been seen on your side of the stream . Your own officials do not oppress the people in the gorge . Doubtless they are afraid of your severity . You are a just man and a powerful one , "
128041	128046	128047	128047	he	3823	" Si , senor , "
128052	128089	128047	128047	he	3823	" I and two or three others , the lucky ones left at liberty , buried them all in one grave near the ashes of their ranch , under the tree that had shaded its roof . "
128314	128345	128346	128346	Ignacio	374	" And now from robbers we have become soldiers . But look , Caballero , at those who made us soldiers and him a general ! Look at these people ! "
128536	128544	128532	128532	they	3858	" Is it you , Dona Emilia ? "
128653	128660	128662	128663	Charles Gould	250	" I must leave you here , "
128753	128765	128766	128766	she	256	" Misericordia ! We are getting terribly bruised in this crowd ! "
128775	128830	128831	128831	She	256	" We have started on foot . All our servants ran away yesterday to join the democrats . We are going to put ourselves under the protection of Father Corbelan , of your sainted uncle , Antonia . He has wrought a miracle in the heart of a most merciless robber . A miracle ! "
128960	128967	128969	128970	Charles Gould	250	" I must leave you now , "
128996	129017	128989	128989	Hernandez	349	" Has not the master of the mine any message to send to Hernandez , the master of the Campo ? "
129100	129107	129109	129112	the emissary of Hernandez	3884	" You are a just man , "
129114	129268	129109	129112	the emissary of Hernandez	3884	" Look at those people who made my compadre a general and have turned us all into soldiers . Look at those oligarchs fleeing for life , with only the clothes on their backs . My compadre does not think of that , but our followers may be wondering greatly , and I would speak for them to you . Listen , senor ! For many months now the Campo has been our own . We need ask no man for anything ; but soldiers must have their pay to live honestly when the wars are over . It is believed that your soul is so just that a prayer from you would cure the sickness of every beast , like the orison of the upright judge . Let me have some words from your lips that would act like a charm upon the doubts of our partida , where all are men . "
129269	129277	129278	129279	Charles Gould	250	" Do you hear what he says ? "
129286	129292	129293	129293	she	256	" Forgive us our misery ! "
129298	129356	129293	129293	she	256	" It is your character that is the inexhaustible treasure which may save us all yet ; your character , Carlos , not your wealth . I entreat you to give this man your word that you will accept any arrangement my uncle may make with their chief . One word . He will want no more . "
129522	129534	129535	129535	he	374	" Take a good look at the mules , mi amo , "
129538	129546	129535	129535	he	374	" You shall never see them again ! "
129759	129764	129766	129766	him	250	" Viva la libertad ! "
131131	131242	131243	131244	Charles Gould	250	" My advice , senores , is that you should wait for your fate in your houses . There is no necessity for you to give yourselves up formally into Montero 's hands . Submission to the inevitable , as Don Juste calls it , is all very well , but when the inevitable is called Pedrito Montero there is no need to exhibit pointedly the whole extent of your surrender . The fault of this country is the want of measure in political life . Flat acquiescence in illegality , followed by sanguinary reaction - that , senores , is not the way to a stable and prosperous future . "
131303	131321	131299	131300	Don Juste	389	" You are abandoning us , Don Carlos . . . . And yet , parliamentary institutions - "
131604	131632	131593	131593	her	3999	" It is not long since he had become a Cargador - only a few weeks . His worship the Capataz had accepted him after many entreaties . "
131633	131643	131645	131646	the doctor	6199	" I am not responsible for the great Capataz , "
131963	131977	131978	131979	the doctor	6199	" You know that I never approved of the silver being sent away , "
132313	132318	132308	132308	his	6199	" Decoud ! Decoud ! "
132710	132716	132705	132705	he	249	" Will you confess now ? "
132962	132984	132958	132958	he	466	" What 's the use of wasting time over that miserable nonsense ! Let me take him outside for a while . "
133253	133256	133258	133259	Father Beron	466	" bad disposition "
133374	133380	133370	133370	his	466	" Will you confess now ? "
134400	134405	134381	134381	he	250	" Decoud , Decoud ! "
134582	134587	134590	134591	Charles Gould	250	" What of Decoud ? "
134617	134626	134603	134603	His	250	" You have brought some news , doctor ? "
134692	134699	134700	134700	He	250	" You must want some breakfast . "
134787	134799	134776	134777	Charles Gould	250	" No , there does not seem any room for doubt . "
134805	134832	134833	134833	She	248	" No , I do n't see myself how we could question that wretched Hirsch 's tale . It 's only too true , I fear . "
134936	134942	134943	134943	he	250	" I am not surprised , "
135327	135430	135315	135315	himself	250	" . . . . The men at the head of the movement are dead or have fled ; the civil organization of the province is at an end for the present ; the Blanco party in Sulaco has collapsed inexcusably , but in the characteristic manner of this country . But Barrios , untouched in Cayta , remains still available . I am forced to take up openly the plan of a provincial revolution as the only way of placing the enormous material interests involved in the prosperity and peace of Sulaco in a position of permanent safety . . . . "
135573	135589	135590	135590	she	248	" What would I have done if Charley had been drowned while we were engaged ? "
135633	135639	135640	135640	she	248	" Antonia will kill herself ! "
135741	135748	135749	135749	he	249	" She thinks of that girl , "
135819	135833	135810	135811	No one	602	" Charles Gould , staring at the wall , pursued his reflections subtly . "
135871	136021	136022	136023	That Hirsch	4168	" But was Barrios really available ? Perhaps . But he was inaccessible . To send off a boat to Cayta was no longer possible , since Sotillo was master of the harbour , and had a steamer at his disposal . And now , with all the democrats in the province up , and every Campo township in a state of disturbance , where could he find a man who would make his way successfully overland to Cayta with a message , a ten days ' ride at least ; a man of courage and resolution , who would avoid arrest or murder , and if arrested would faithfully eat the paper ? The Capataz de Cargadores would have been just such a man . But the Capataz of the Cargadores was no more . And Charles Gould , withdrawing his eyes from the wall , said gently , "
136096	136097	136084	136084	I	0	" "
136111	136116	136107	136107	Hernandez	349	" remarked the doctor . "
136132	136142	136143	136143	Antonia	380	" marvelled Charles Gould . Mrs. Gould cried out - "
136157	136158	136159	136159	Nobody	976	" "
136167	136172	136159	136159	Nobody	976	" remarked the doctor . "
136196	136203	136193	136194	the devil	772	" He turned to Charles Gould . "
136250	136251	136263	136263	Capataz	267	" "
136254	136259	136263	136263	Capataz	267	" murmured Charles Gould ; "
136296	136422	136284	136284	He	267	" His voice was covered by the booming of the great bell of the cathedral . Three single strokes , one after another , burst out explosively , dying away in deep and mellow vibrations . And then all the bells in the tower of every church , convent , or chapel in town , even those that had remained shut up for years , pealed out together with a crash . In this furious flood of metallic uproar there was a power of suggesting images of strife and violence which blanched Mrs. Gould 's cheek . Basilio , who had been waiting at table , shrinking within himself , clung to the sideboard with chattering teeth . It was impossible to hear yourself speak . "
136427	136489	136284	136284	He	267	" Charles Gould yelled at him , angrily . All the other servants , terrified at what they took for the signal of a general massacre , had rushed upstairs , tumbling over each other , men and women , the obscure and generally invisible population of the ground floor on the four sides of the patio . The women , screaming "
136492	137005	136284	136284	He	267	" ran right into the room , and , falling on their knees against the walls , began to cross themselves convulsively . The staring heads of men blocked the doorway in an instant - mozos from the stable , gardeners , nondescript helpers living on the crumbs of the munificent house - and Charles Gould beheld all the extent of his domestic establishment , even to the gatekeeper . This was a half - paralyzed old man , whose long white locks fell down to his shoulders : an heirloom taken up by Charles Gould 's familial piety . He could remember Henry Gould , an Englishman and a Costaguanero of the second generation , chief of the Sulaco province ; he had been his personal mozo years and years ago in peace and war ; had been allowed to attend his master in prison ; had , on the fatal morning , followed the firing squad ; and , peeping from behind one of the cypresses growing along the wall of the Franciscan Convent , had seen , with his eyes starting out of his head , Don Enrique throw up his hands and fall with his face in the dust . Charles Gould noted particularly the big patriarchal head of that witness in the rear of the other servants . But he was surprised to see a shrivelled old hag or two , of whose existence within the walls of his house he had not been aware . They must have been the mothers , or even the grandmothers of some of his people . There were a few children , too , more or less naked , crying and clinging to the legs of their elders . He had never before noticed any sign of a child in his patio . Even Leonarda , the camerista , came in a fright , pushing through , with her spoiled , pouting face of a favourite maid , leading the Viola girls by the hand . The crockery rattled on table and sideboard , and the whole house seemed to sway in the deafening wave of sound . CHAPTER FIVE During the night the expectant populace had taken possession of all the belfries in the town in order to welcome Pedrito Montero , who was making his entry after having slept the night in Rincon . And first came straggling in through the land gate the armed mob of all colours , complexions , types , and states of raggedness , calling themselves the Sulaco National Guard , and commanded by Senor Gamacho . Through the middle of the street streamed , like a torrent of rubbish , a mass of straw hats , ponchos , gun - barrels , with an enormous green and yellow flag flapping in their midst , in a cloud of dust , to the furious beating of drums . The spectators recoiled against the walls of the houses shouting their Vivas ! Behind the rabble could be seen the lances of the cavalry , the "
137007	137321	137324	137325	that saint	4184	" of Pedro Montero . He advanced between Senores Fuentes and Gamacho at the head of his llaneros , who had accomplished the feat of crossing the Paramos of the Higuerota in a snow - storm . They rode four abreast , mounted on confiscated Campo horses , clad in the heterogeneous stock of roadside stores they had looted hurriedly in their rapid ride through the northern part of the province ; for Pedro Montero had been in a great hurry to occupy Sulaco . The handkerchiefs knotted loosely around their bare throats were glaringly new , and all the right sleeves of their cotton shirts had been cut off close to the shoulder for greater freedom in throwing the lazo . Emaciated greybeards rode by the side of lean dark youths , marked by all the hardships of campaigning , with strips of raw beef twined round the crowns of their hats , and huge iron spurs fastened to their naked heels . Those that in the passes of the mountain had lost their lances had provided themselves with the goads used by the Campo cattlemen : slender shafts of palm fully ten feet long , with a lot of loose rings jingling under the ironshod point . They were armed with knives and revolvers . A haggard fearlessness characterized the expression of all these sun - blacked countenances ; they glared down haughtily with their scorched eyes at the crowd , or , blinking upwards insolently , pointed out to each other some particular head amongst the women at the windows . When they had ridden into the Plaza and caught sight of the equestrian statue of the King dazzlingly white in the sunshine , towering enormous and motionless above the surges of the crowd , with its eternal gesture of saluting , a murmur of surprise ran through their ranks . "
137331	138547	137324	137325	that saint	4184	" they asked each other . They were a good sample of the cavalry of the plains with which Pedro Montero had helped so much the victorious career of his brother the general . The influence which that man , brought up in coast towns , acquired in a short time over the plainsmen of the Republic can be ascribed only to a genius for treachery of so effective a kind that it must have appeared to those violent men but little removed from a state of utter savagery , as the perfection of sagacity and virtue . The popular lore of all nations testifies that duplicity and cunning , together with bodily strength , were looked upon , even more than courage , as heroic virtues by primitive mankind . To overcome your adversary was the great affair of life . Courage was taken for granted . But the use of intelligence awakened wonder and respect . Stratagems , providing they did not fail , were honourable ; the easy massacre of an unsuspecting enemy evoked no feelings but those of gladness , pride , and admiration . Not perhaps that primitive men were more faithless than their descendants of to - day , but that they went straighter to their aim , and were more artless in their recognition of success as the only standard of morality . We have changed since . The use of intelligence awakens little wonder and less respect . But the ignorant and barbarous plainsmen engaging in civil strife followed willingly a leader who often managed to deliver their enemies bound , as it were , into their hands . Pedro Montero had a talent for lulling his adversaries into a sense of security . And as men learn wisdom with extreme slowness , and are always ready to believe promises that flatter their secret hopes , Pedro Montero was successful time after time . Whether only a servant or some inferior official in the Costaguana Legation in Paris , he had rushed back to his country directly he heard that his brother had emerged from the obscurity of his frontier commandancia . He had managed to deceive by his gift of plausibility the chiefs of the Ribierist movement in the capital , and even the acute agent of the San Tome mine had failed to understand him thoroughly . At once he had obtained an enormous influence over his brother . They were very much alike in appearance , both bald , with bunches of crisp hair above their ears , arguing the presence of some negro blood . Only Pedro was smaller than the general , more delicate altogether , with an ape - like faculty for imitating all the outward signs of refinement and distinction , and with a parrot - like talent for languages . Both brothers had received some elementary instruction by the munificence of a great European traveller , to whom their father had been a body - servant during his journeys in the interior of the country . In General Montero 's case it enabled him to rise from the ranks . Pedrito , the younger , incorrigibly lazy and slovenly , had drifted aimlessly from one coast town to another , hanging about counting - houses , attaching himself to strangers as a sort of valet - de - place , picking up an easy and disreputable living . His ability to read did nothing for him but fill his head with absurd visions . His actions were usually determined by motives so improbable in themselves as to escape the penetration of a rational person . Thus at first sight the agent of the Gould Concession in Sta . Marta had credited him with the possession of sane views , and even with a restraining power over the general 's everlastingly discontented vanity . It could never have entered his head that Pedrito Montero , lackey or inferior scribe , lodged in the garrets of the various Parisian hotels where the Costaguana Legation used to shelter its diplomatic dignity , had been devouring the lighter sort of historical works in the French language , such , for instance as the books of Imbert de Saint Amand upon the Second Empire . But Pedrito had been struck by the splendour of a brilliant court , and had conceived the idea of an existence for himself where , like the Duc de Morny , he would associate the command of every pleasure with the conduct of political affairs and enjoy power supremely in every way . Nobody could have guessed that . And yet this was one of the immediate causes of the Monterist Revolution . This will appear less incredible by the reflection that the fundamental causes were the same as ever , rooted in the political immaturity of the people , in the indolence of the upper classes and the mental darkness of the lower . Pedrito Montero saw in the elevation of his brother the road wide open to his wildest imaginings . This was what made the Monterist pronunciamiento so unpreventable . The general himself probably could have been bought off , pacified with flatteries , despatched on a diplomatic mission to Europe . It was his brother who had egged him on from first to last . He wanted to become the most brilliant statesman of South America . He did not desire supreme power . He would have been afraid of its labour and risk , in fact . Before all , Pedrito Montero , taught by his European experience , meant to acquire a serious fortune for himself . With this object in view he obtained from his brother , on the very morrow of the successful battle , the permission to push on over the mountains and take possession of Sulaco . Sulaco was the land of future prosperity , the chosen land of material progress , the only province in the Republic of interest to European capitalists . Pedrito Montero , following the example of the Duc de Morny , meant to have his share of this prosperity . This is what he meant literally . Now his brother was master of the country , whether as President , Dictator , or even as Emperor - why not as an Emperor ? - he meant to demand a share in every enterprise - in railways , in mines , in sugar estates , in cotton mills , in land companies , in each and every undertaking - as the price of his protection . The desire to be on the spot early was the real cause of the celebrated ride over the mountains with some two hundred llaneros , an enterprise of which the dangers had not appeared at first clearly to his impatience . Coming from a series of victories , it seemed to him that a Montero had only to appear to be master of the situation . This illusion had betrayed him into a rashness of which he was becoming aware . As he rode at the head of his llaneros he regretted that there were so few of them . The enthusiasm of the populace reassured him . They yelled "
138554	138718	138551	138552	Viva Pedrito	423	" In order to make them still more enthusiastic , and from the natural pleasure he had in dissembling , he dropped the reins on his horse 's neck , and with a tremendous effect of familiarity and confidence slipped his hands under the arms of Senores Fuentes and Gamacho . In that posture , with a ragged town mozo holding his horse by the bridle , he rode triumphantly across the Plaza to the door of the Intendencia . Its old gloomy walls seemed to shake in the acclamations that rent the air and covered the crashing peals of the cathedral bells . Pedro Montero , the brother of the general , dismounted into a shouting and perspiring throng of enthusiasts whom the ragged Nationals were pushing back fiercely . Ascending a few steps he surveyed the large crowd gaping at him and the bullet - speckled walls of the houses opposite lightly veiled by a sunny haze of dust . The word "
138720	138860	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" in immense black capitals , alternating with broken windows , stared at him across the vast space ; and he thought with delight of the hour of vengeance , because he was very sure of laying his hands upon Decoud . On his left hand , Gamacho , big and hot , wiping his hairy wet face , uncovered a set of yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity . On his right , Senor Fuentes , small and lean , looked on with compressed lips . The crowd stared literally open - mouthed , lost in eager stillness , as though they had expected the great guerrillero , the famous Pedrito , to begin scattering at once some sort of visible largesse . What he began was a speech . He began it with the shouted word "
138863	139032	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" which reached even those in the middle of the Plaza . Afterwards the greater part of the citizens remained fascinated by the orator 's action alone , his tip - toeing , the arms flung above his head with the fists clenched , a hand laid flat upon the heart , the silver gleam of rolling eyes , the sweeping , pointing , embracing gestures , a hand laid familiarly on Gamacho 's shoulder ; a hand waved formally towards the little black - coated person of Senor Fuentes , advocate and politician and a true friend of the people . The vivas of those nearest to the orator bursting out suddenly propagated themselves irregularly to the confines of the crowd , like flames running over dry grass , and expired in the opening of the streets . In the intervals , over the swarming Plaza brooded a heavy silence , in which the mouth of the orator went on opening and shutting , and detached phrases - "
139039	139040	139036	139037	the people	605	" "
139046	139047	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" "
139055	139141	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" - reached even the packed steps of the cathedral with a feeble clear ring , thin as the buzzing of a mosquito . But the orator struck his breast ; he seemed to prance between his two supporters . It was the supreme effort of his peroration . Then the two smaller figures disappeared from the public gaze and the enormous Gamacho , left alone , advanced , raising his hat high above his head . Then he covered himself proudly and yelled out , "
139144	139184	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" A dull roar greeted Senor Gamacho , ex - pedlar of the Campo , Commandante of the National Guards . Upstairs Pedrito Montero walked about rapidly from one wrecked room of the Intendencia to another , snarling incessantly - "
139191	139205	138861	138861	Citizens	4185	" Senor Fuentes , following , would relax his taciturn disposition to murmur - "
139217	139334	139335	139336	The brute	4191	" and then , inclining his head on his left shoulder , would press together his lips so firmly that a little hollow would appear at each corner . He had his nomination for Political Chief of the town in his pocket , and was all impatience to enter upon his functions . In the long audience room , with its tall mirrors all starred by stones , the hangings torn down and the canopy over the platform at the upper end pulled to pieces , the vast , deep muttering of the crowd and the howling voice of Gamacho speaking just below reached them through the shutters as they stood idly in dimness and desolation . "
139338	139349	139335	139336	The brute	4191	" observed his Excellency Don Pedro Montero through clenched teeth . "
139369	139447	139367	139367	Hernandez	349	" The new Gefe Politico only jerked his head sideways , and took a puff at his cigarette in sign of his agreement with this method for ridding the town of Gamacho and his inconvenient rabble . Pedrito Montero looked with disgust at the absolutely bare floor , and at the belt of heavy gilt picture - frames running round the room , out of which the remnants of torn and slashed canvases fluttered like dingy rags . "
139453	139525	139451	139451	barbarians	4194	" he said . This was what said his Excellency , the popular Pedrito , the guerrillero skilled in the art of laying ambushes , charged by his brother at his own demand with the organization of Sulaco on democratic principles . The night before , during the consultation with his partisans , who had come out to meet him in Rincon , he had opened his intentions to Senor Fuentes - "
139566	140891	140892	140892	Bueno	471	" And Senor Fuentes , puffing out his leathery cheeks , had inclined his head slightly to the left , letting a thin , bluish jet of smoke escape through his pursed lips . He had understood . His Excellency was exasperated at the devastation . Not a single chair , table , sofa , etagere or console had been left in the state rooms of the Intendencia . His Excellency , though twitching all over with rage , was restrained from bursting into violence by a sense of his remoteness and isolation . His heroic brother was very far away . Meantime , how was he going to take his siesta ? He had expected to find comfort and luxury in the Intendencia after a year of hard camp life , ending with the hardships and privations of the daring dash upon Sulaco - upon the province which was worth more in wealth and influence than all the rest of the Republic 's territory . He would get even with Gamacho by - and - by . And Senor Gamacho 's oration , delectable to popular ears , went on in the heat and glare of the Plaza like the uncouth howlings of an inferior sort of devil cast into a white - hot furnace . Every moment he had to wipe his streaming face with his bare fore - arm ; he had flung off his coat , and had turned up the sleeves of his shirt high above the elbows ; but he kept on his head the large cocked hat with white plumes . His ingenuousness cherished this sign of his rank as Commandante of the National Guards . Approving and grave murmurs greeted his periods . His opinion was that war should be declared at once against France , England , Germany , and the United States , who , by introducing railways , mining enterprises , colonization , and under such other shallow pretences , aimed at robbing poor people of their lands , and with the help of these Goths and paralytics , the aristocrats would convert them into toiling and miserable slaves . And the leperos , flinging about the corners of their dirty white mantas , yelled their approbation . General Montero , Gamacho howled with conviction , was the only man equal to the patriotic task . They assented to that , too . The morning was wearing on ; there were already signs of disruption , currents and eddies in the crowd . Some were seeking the shade of the walls and under the trees of the Alameda . Horsemen spurred through , shouting ; groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into the streets , where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars . The National Guards were thinking of siesta , and the eloquence of Gamacho , their chief , was exhausted . Later on , when , in the cooler hours of the afternoon , they tried to assemble again for further consideration of public affairs , detachments of Montero 's cavalry camped on the Alameda charged them without parley , at speed , with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as the ends of the streets . The National Guards of Sulaco were surprised by this proceeding . But they were not indignant . No Costaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of a military force . They were part of the natural order of things . This must be , they concluded , some kind of administrative measure , no doubt . But the motive of it escaped their unaided intelligence , and their chief and orator , Gamacho , Commandante of the National Guard , was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom of his family . His bare feet were upturned in the shadows repulsively , in the manner of a corpse . His eloquent mouth had dropped open . His youngest daughter , scratching her head with one hand , with the other waved a green bough over his scorched and peeling face . CHAPTER SIX The declining sun had shifted the shadows from west to east amongst the houses of the town . It had shifted them upon the whole extent of the immense Campo , with the white walls of its haciendas on the knolls dominating the green distances ; with its grass - thatched ranches crouching in the folds of ground by the banks of streams ; with the dark islands of clustered trees on a clear sea of grass , and the precipitous range of the Cordillera , immense and motionless , emerging from the billows of the lower forests like the barren coast of a land of giants . The sunset rays striking the snow - slope of Higuerota from afar gave it an air of rosy youth , while the serrated mass of distant peaks remained black , as if calcined in the fiery radiance . The undulating surface of the forests seemed powdered with pale gold dust ; and away there , beyond Rincon , hidden from the town by two wooded spurs , the rocks of the San Tome gorge , with the flat wall of the mountain itself crowned by gigantic ferns , took on warm tones of brown and yellow , with red rusty streaks , and the dark green clumps of bushes rooted in crevices . From the plain the stamp sheds and the houses of the mine appeared dark and small , high up , like the nests of birds clustered on the ledges of a cliff . The zigzag paths resembled faint tracings scratched on the wall of a cyclopean blockhouse . To the two serenos of the mine on patrol duty , strolling , carbine in hand , and watchful eyes , in the shade of the trees lining the stream near the bridge , Don Pepe , descending the path from the upper plateau , appeared no bigger than a large beetle . With his air of aimless , insect - like going to and fro upon the face of the rock , Don Pepe 's figure kept on descending steadily , and , when near the bottom , sank at last behind the roofs of store - houses , forges , and workshops . For a time the pair of serenos strolled back and forth before the bridge , on which they had stopped a horseman holding a large white envelope in his hand . Then Don Pepe , emerging in the village street from amongst the houses , not a stone 's throw from the frontier bridge , approached , striding in wide dark trousers tucked into boots , a white linen jacket , sabre at his side , and revolver at his belt . In this disturbed time nothing could find the Senor Gobernador with his boots off , as the saying is . At a slight nod from one of the serenos , the man , a messenger from the town , dismounted , and crossed the bridge , leading his horse by the bridle . Don Pepe received the letter from his other hand , slapped his left side and his hips in succession , feeling for his spectacle case . After settling the heavy silvermounted affair astride his nose , and adjusting it carefully behind his ears , he opened the envelope , holding it up at about a foot in front of his eyes . The paper he pulled out contained some three lines of writing . He looked at them for a long time . His grey moustache moved slightly up and down , and the wrinkles , radiating at the corners of his eyes , ran together . He nodded serenely . "
140894	140898	140892	140892	Bueno	471	" he said . "
140904	142443	140892	140892	Bueno	471	" Then , in his quiet , kindly way , he engaged in a cautious conversation with the man , who was willing to talk cheerily , as if something lucky had happened to him recently . He had seen from a distance Sotillo 's infantry camped along the shore of the harbour on each side of the Custom House . They had done no damage to the buildings . The foreigners of the railway remained shut up within the yards . They were no longer anxious to shoot poor people . He cursed the foreigners ; then he reported Montero 's entry and the rumours of the town . The poor were going to be made rich now . That was very good . More he did not know , and , breaking into propitiatory smiles , he intimated that he was hungry and thirsty . The old major directed him to go to the alcalde of the first village . The man rode off , and Don Pepe , striding slowly in the direction of a little wooden belfry , looked over a hedge into a little garden , and saw Father Roman sitting in a white hammock slung between two orange trees in front of the presbytery . An enormous tamarind shaded with its dark foliage the whole white framehouse . A young Indian girl with long hair , big eyes , and small hands and feet , carried out a wooden chair , while a thin old woman , crabbed and vigilant , watched her all the time from the verandah . Don Pepe sat down in the chair and lighted a cigar ; the priest drew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of his palm . On his reddish - brown face , worn , hollowed as if crumbled , the eyes , fresh and candid , sparkled like two black diamonds . Don Pepe , in a mild and humorous voice , informed Father Roman that Pedrito Montero , by the hand of Senor Fuentes , had asked him on what terms he would surrender the mine in proper working order to a legally constituted commission of patriotic citizens , escorted by a small military force . The priest cast his eyes up to heaven . However , Don Pepe continued , the mozo who brought the letter said that Don Carlos Gould was alive , and so far unmolested . Father Roman expressed in a few words his thankfulness at hearing of the Senor Administrador 's safety . The hour of oration had gone by in the silvery ringing of a bell in the little belfry . The belt of forest closing the entrance of the valley stood like a screen between the low sun and the street of the village . At the other end of the rocky gorge , between the walls of basalt and granite , a forest - clad mountain , hiding all the range from the San Tome dwellers , rose steeply , lighted up and leafy to the very top . Three small rosy clouds hung motionless overhead in the great depth of blue . Knots of people sat in the street between the wattled huts . Before the casa of the alcalde , the foremen of the night - shift , already assembled to lead their men , squatted on the ground in a circle of leather skull - caps , and , bowing their bronze backs , were passing round the gourd of mate . The mozo from the town , having fastened his horse to a wooden post before the door , was telling them the news of Sulaco as the blackened gourd of the decoction passed from hand to hand . The grave alcalde himself , in a white waistcloth and a flowered chintz gown with sleeves , open wide upon his naked stout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing robe , stood by , wearing a rough beaver hat at the back of his head , and grasping a tall staff with a silver knob in his hand . These insignia of his dignity had been conferred upon him by the Administration of the mine , the fountain of honour , of prosperity , and peace . He had been one of the first immigrants into this valley ; his sons and sons - in - law worked within the mountain which seemed with its treasures to pour down the thundering ore shoots of the upper mesa , the gifts of well - being , security , and justice upon the toilers . He listened to the news from the town with curiosity and indifference , as if concerning another world than his own . And it was true that they appeared to him so . In a very few years the sense of belonging to a powerful organization had been developed in these harassed , half - wild Indians . They were proud of , and attached to , the mine . It had secured their confidence and belief . They invested it with a protecting and invincible virtue as though it were a fetish made by their own hands , for they were ignorant , and in other respects did not differ appreciably from the rest of mankind which puts infinite trust in its own creations . It never entered the alcalde 's head that the mine could fail in its protection and force . Politics were good enough for the people of the town and the Campo . His yellow , round face , with wide nostrils , and motionless in expression , resembled a fierce full moon . He listened to the excited vapourings of the mozo without misgivings , without surprise , without any active sentiment whatever . Padre Roman sat dejectedly balancing himself , his feet just touching the ground , his hands gripping the edge of the hammock . With less confidence , but as ignorant as his flock , he asked the major what did he think was going to happen now . Don Pepe , bolt upright in the chair , folded his hands peacefully on the hilt of his sword , standing perpendicular between his thighs , and answered that he did not know . The mine could be defended against any force likely to be sent to take possession . On the other hand , from the arid character of the valley , when the regular supplies from the Campo had been cut off , the population of the three villages could be starved into submission . Don Pepe exposed these contingencies with serenity to Father Roman , who , as an old campaigner , was able to understand the reasoning of a military man . They talked with simplicity and directness . Father Roman was saddened at the idea of his flock being scattered or else enslaved . He had no illusions as to their fate , not from penetration , but from long experience of political atrocities , which seemed to him fatal and unavoidable in the life of a State . The working of the usual public institutions presented itself to him most distinctly as a series of calamities overtaking private individuals and flowing logically from each other through hate , revenge , folly , and rapacity , as though they had been part of a divine dispensation . Father Roman 's clear - sightedness was served by an uninformed intelligence ; but his heart , preserving its tenderness amongst scenes of carnage , spoliation , and violence , abhorred these calamities the more as his association with the victims was closer . He entertained towards the Indians of the valley feelings of paternal scorn . He had been marrying , baptizing , confessing , absolving , and burying the workers of the San Tome mine with dignity and unction for five years or more ; and he believed in the sacredness of these ministrations , which made them his own in a spiritual sense . They were dear to his sacerdotal supremacy . Mrs. Gould 's earnest interest in the concerns of these people enhanced their importance in the priest 's eyes , because it really augmented his own . When talking over with her the innumerable Marias and Brigidas of the villages , he felt his own humanity expand . Padre Roman was incapable of fanaticism to an almost reprehensible degree . The English senora was evidently a heretic ; but at the same time she seemed to him wonderful and angelic . Whenever that confused state of his feelings occurred to him , while strolling , for instance , his breviary under his arm , in the wide shade of the tamarind , he would stop short to inhale with a strong snuffling noise a large quantity of snuff , and shake his head profoundly . At the thought of what might befall the illustrious senora presently , he became gradually overcome with dismay . He voiced it in an agitated murmur . Even Don Pepe lost his serenity for a moment . He leaned forward stiffly . "
142534	142794	142517	142517	Bueno	471	" And he regained his composure . He regained it easily , because whatever happened his honour of an old officer of Paez was safe . He had promised Charles Gould that at the approach of an armed force he would defend the gorge just long enough to give himself time to destroy scientifically the whole plant , buildings , and workshops of the mine with heavy charges of dynamite ; block with ruins the main tunnel , break down the pathways , blow up the dam of the water - power , shatter the famous Gould Concession into fragments , flying sky high out of a horrified world . The mine had got hold of Charles Gould with a grip as deadly as ever it had laid upon his father . But this extreme resolution had seemed to Don Pepe the most natural thing in the world . His measures had been taken with judgment . Everything was prepared with a careful completeness . And Don Pepe folded his hands pacifically on his sword hilt , and nodded at the priest . In his excitement , Father Roman had flung snuff in handfuls at his face , and , all besmeared with tobacco , round - eyed , and beside himself , had got out of the hammock to walk about , uttering exclamations . Don Pepe stroked his grey and pendant moustache , whose fine ends hung far below the clean - cut line of his jaw , and spoke with a conscious pride in his reputation . "
142850	142868	142846	142846	people	5626	" He began to turn the cigar in his lips a little nervously , and went on - "
142932	142952	142894	142894	I	0	" His folded hands twitched on the hilt . The cigar turned faster in the corner of his lips . "
143085	143637	143076	143081	one of Paez 's old chaplains	4218	" He got up , long , lank , upright , hard , with his martial moustache and the bony structure of his face , from which the glance of the sunken eyes seemed to transfix the priest , who stood still , an empty wooden snuff - box held upside down in his hand , and glared back , speechless , at the governor of the mine . CHAPTER SEVEN At about that time , in the Intendencia of Sulaco , Charles Gould was assuring Pedrito Montero , who had sent a request for his presence there , that he would never let the mine pass out of his hands for the profit of a Government who had robbed him of it . The Gould Concession could not be resumed . His father had not desired it . The son would never surrender it . He would never surrender it alive . And once dead , where was the power capable of resuscitating such an enterprise in all its vigour and wealth out of the ashes and ruin of destruction ? There was no such power in the country . And where was the skill and capital abroad that would condescend to touch such an ill - omened corpse ? Charles Gould talked in the impassive tone which had for many years served to conceal his anger and contempt . He suffered . He was disgusted with what he had to say . It was too much like heroics . In him the strictly practical instinct was in profound discord with the almost mystic view he took of his right . The Gould Concession was symbolic of abstract justice . Let the heavens fall . But since the San Tome mine had developed into world - wide fame his threat had enough force and effectiveness to reach the rudimentary intelligence of Pedro Montero , wrapped up as it was in the futilities of historical anecdotes . The Gould Concession was a serious asset in the country 's finance , and , what was more , in the private budgets of many officials as well . It was traditional . It was known . It was said . It was credible . Every Minister of Interior drew a salary from the San Tome mine . It was natural . And Pedrito intended to be Minister of the Interior and President of the Council in his brother 's Government . The Duc de Morny had occupied those high posts during the Second French Empire with conspicuous advantage to himself . A table , a chair , a wooden bedstead had been procured for His Excellency , who , after a short siesta , rendered absolutely necessary by the labours and the pomps of his entry into Sulaco , had been getting hold of the administrative machine by making appointments , giving orders , and signing proclamations . Alone with Charles Gould in the audience room , His Excellency managed with his well - known skill to conceal his annoyance and consternation . He had begun at first to talk loftily of confiscation , but the want of all proper feeling and mobility in the Senor Administrador 's features ended by affecting adversely his power of masterful expression . Charles Gould had repeated : "
143664	143918	144319	144320	Don Carlos	298	" It was an alarming pronouncement , and well calculated to hurt the sensibilities of a politician whose mind is bent upon the spoils of victory . And Charles Gould said also that the destruction of the San Tome mine would cause the ruin of other undertakings , the withdrawal of European capital , the withholding , most probably , of the last instalment of the foreign loan . That stony fiend of a man said all these things which were accessible to His Excellency 's intelligence in a coldblooded manner which made one shudder . A long course of reading historical works , light and gossipy in tone , carried out in garrets of Parisian hotels , sprawling on an untidy bed , to the neglect of his duties , menial or otherwise , had affected the manners of Pedro Montero . Had he seen around him the splendour of the old Intendencia , the magnificent hangings , the gilt furniture ranged along the walls ; had he stood upon a dais on a noble square of red carpet , he would have probably been very dangerous from a sense of success and elevation . But in this sacked and devastated residence , with the three pieces of common furniture huddled up in the middle of the vast apartment , Pedrito 's imagination was subdued by a feeling of insecurity and impermanence . That feeling and the firm attitude of Charles Gould who had not once , so far , pronounced the word "
143921	144010	144319	144320	Don Carlos	298	" diminished him in his own eyes . He assumed the tone of an enlightened man of the world , and begged Charles Gould to dismiss from his mind every cause for alarm . He was now conversing , he reminded him , with the brother of the master of the country , charged with a reorganizing mission . The trusted brother of the master of the country , he repeated . Nothing was further from the thoughts of that wise and patriotic hero than ideas of destruction . "
144029	144304	144011	144011	I	0	" he cried , in a burst of condescending effusion . Pedrito Montero surprised one at first sight by the vast development of his bald forehead , a shiny yellow expanse between the crinkly coal - black tufts of hair without any lustre , the engaging form of his mouth , and an unexpectedly cultivated voice . But his eyes , very glistening as if freshly painted on each side of his hooked nose , had a round , hopeless , birdlike stare when opened fully . Now , however , he narrowed them agreeably , throwing his square chin up and speaking with closed teeth slightly through the nose , with what he imagined to be the manner of a grand seigneur . In that attitude , he declared suddenly that the highest expression of democracy was Caesarism : the imperial rule based upon the direct popular vote . Caesarism was conservative . It was strong . It recognized the legitimate needs of democracy which requires orders , titles , and distinctions . They would be showered upon deserving men . Caesarism was peace . It was progressive . It secured the prosperity of a country . Pedrito Montero was carried away . Look at what the Second Empire had done for France . It was a regime which delighted to honour men of Don Carlos 's stamp . The Second Empire fell , but that was because its chief was devoid of that military genius which had raised General Montero to the pinnacle of fame and glory . Pedrito elevated his hand jerkily to help the idea of pinnacle , of fame . "
144322	144415	144319	144320	Don Carlos	298	" he cried in a tone of fellowship . Republicanism had done its work . Imperial democracy was the power of the future . Pedrito , the guerrillero , showing his hand , lowered his voice forcibly . A man singled out by his fellow - citizens for the honourable nickname of El Rey de Sulaco could not but receive a full recognition from an imperial democracy as a great captain of industry and a person of weighty counsel , whose popular designation would be soon replaced by a more solid title . "
144440	144967	144436	144436	marquis	4225	" He ceased . The air was cool on the Plaza , where a patrol of cavalry rode round and round without penetrating into the streets , which resounded with shouts and the strumming of guitars issuing from the open doors of pulperias . The orders were not to interfere with the enjoyments of the people . And above the roofs , next to the perpendicular lines of the cathedral towers the snowy curve of Higuerota blocked a large space of darkening blue sky before the windows of the Intendencia . After a time Pedrito Montero , thrusting his hand in the bosom of his coat , bowed his head with slow dignity . The audience was over . Charles Gould on going out passed his hand over his forehead as if to disperse the mists of an oppressive dream , whose grotesque extravagance leaves behind a subtle sense of bodily danger and intellectual decay . In the passages and on the staircases of the old palace Montero 's troopers lounged about insolently , smoking and making way for no one ; the clanking of sabres and spurs resounded all over the building . Three silent groups of civilians in severe black waited in the main gallery , formal and helpless , a little huddled up , each keeping apart from the others , as if in the exercise of a public duty they had been overcome by a desire to shun the notice of every eye . These were the deputations waiting for their audience . The one from the Provincial Assembly , more restless and uneasy in its corporate expression , was overtopped by the big face of Don Juste Lopez , soft and white , with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud . The President of the Provincial Assembly , coming bravely to save the last shred of parliamentary institutions on the English model , averted his eyes from the Administrador of the San Tome mine as a dignified rebuke of his little faith in that only saving principle . The mournful severity of that reproof did not affect Charles Gould , but he was sensible to the glances of the others directed upon him without reproach , as if only to read their own fate upon his face . All of them had talked , shouted , and declaimed in the great sala of the Casa Gould . The feeling of compassion for those men , struck with a strange impotence in the toils of moral degradation , did not induce him to make a sign . He suffered from his fellowship in evil with them too much . He crossed the Plaza unmolested . The Amarilla Club was full of festive ragamuffins . Their frowsy heads protruded from every window , and from within came drunken shouts , the thumping of feet , and the twanging of harps . Broken bottles strewed the pavement below . Charles Gould found the doctor still in his house . Dr. Monygham came away from the crack in the shutter through which he had been watching the street . "
144976	144985	144970	144970	You	4226	" he said in a tone of relief . "
145015	145016	145007	145008	the fellow	537	" "
145021	145033	145019	145019	I	0	" confessed Charles Gould , laying his hat on the table . "
145041	145073	145074	145074	I	0	" The silence of Charles Gould seemed to admit that this was the only course . This was as far as Charles Gould was accustomed to go towards expressing his intentions . "
145088	145095	145076	145076	you	4226	" the doctor said , anxiously . "
145116	145141	145142	145142	He	460	" continued Charles Gould , looking away from the doctor , and fixing his eyes upon the water - colour sketch upon the wall . "
145146	145153	145142	145142	He	460	" the doctor asked , eagerly . "
145157	145162	145142	145142	He	460	" said Charles Gould . "
145325	145326	145327	145327	They	4231	" "
145335	145342	145327	145327	They	4231	" the doctor suggested , thoughtfully . "
145348	145376	145327	145327	They	4231	" Charles Gould said very low , as if speaking to himself , and still gazing at the sketch of the San Tome gorge upon the wall . "
145386	145398	145381	145381	they	4231	" Charles Gould looked for the first time at the doctor . "
145405	145409	145381	145381	they	4231	" he added . "
145412	145421	145381	145381	they	4231	" said Dr. Monygham , suppressing his excitement . "
145458	145483	145453	145453	he	332	" Charles Gould , looking at the doctor steadily , shook his head , but the doctor continued with a certain amount of fire - "
145548	145549	145527	145527	I	0	" "
145553	145850	145527	145527	I	0	" muttered Charles Gould , with displeasure . He disapproved of the doctor 's sensitiveness about that far - off episode of his life . So much memory shocked Charles Gould . It was like morbidness . And again he shook his head . He refused to tamper with the open rectitude of Don Pepe 's conduct , both from taste and from policy . Instructions would have to be either verbal or in writing . In either case they ran the risk of being intercepted . It was by no means certain that a messenger could reach the mine ; and , besides , there was no one to send . It was on the tip of Charles 's tongue to say that only the late Capataz de Cargadores could have been employed with some chance of success and the certitude of discretion . But he did not say that . He pointed out to the doctor that it would have been bad policy . Directly Don Pepe let it be supposed that he could be bought over , the Administrador 's personal safety and the safety of his friends would become endangered . For there would be then no reason for moderation . The incorruptibility of Don Pepe was the essential and restraining fact . The doctor hung his head and admitted that in a way it was so . He could n't deny to himself that the reasoning was sound enough . Don Pepe 's usefulness consisted in his unstained character . As to his own usefulness , he reflected bitterly it was also his own character . He declared to Charles Gould that he had the means of keeping Sotillo from joining his forces with Montero , at least for the present . "
145860	145865	145852	145852	you	4240	" the doctor said , "
145909	145910	145891	145891	You	4240	" "
145916	145923	145891	145891	You	4240	" Charles Gould declared , firmly . "
146010	146011	146013	146013	he	442	" "
146017	146038	146013	146013	he	442	" the doctor , an hour later , said hurriedly to Mrs. Gould , whom he met in the corridor . "
146094	146103	146074	146074	I	0	" She put out both her hands impulsively . "
146114	146174	146107	146107	you	249	" she whispered , averting from his face her eyes , full of tears , for a short glance at the door of her husband 's room . She pressed both his hands , and the doctor stood as if rooted to the spot , looking down at her , and trying to twist his lips into a smile . "
146185	147102	146179	146179	you	4247	" he uttered at last , and ran tottering down the stairs across the patio , and out of the house . In the street he kept up a great pace with his smart hobbling walk , a case of instruments under his arm . He was known for being loco . Nobody interfered with him . From under the seaward gate , across the dusty , arid plain , interspersed with low bushes , he saw , more than a mile away , the ugly enormity of the Custom House , and the two or three other buildings which at that time constituted the seaport of Sulaco . Far away to the south groves of palm trees edged the curve of the harbour shore . The distant peaks of the Cordillera had lost their identity of clearcut shapes in the steadily deepening blue of the eastern sky . The doctor walked briskly . A darkling shadow seemed to fall upon him from the zenith . The sun had set . For a time the snows of Higuerota continued to glow with the reflected glory of the west . The doctor , holding a straight course for the Custom House , appeared lonely , hopping amongst the dark bushes like a tall bird with a broken wing . Tints of purple , gold , and crimson were mirrored in the clear water of the harbour . A long tongue of land , straight as a wall , with the grass - grown ruins of the fort making a sort of rounded green mound , plainly visible from the inner shore , closed its circuit ; while beyond the Placid Gulf repeated those splendours of colouring on a greater scale and with a more sombre magnificence . The great mass of cloud filling the head of the gulf had long red smears amongst its convoluted folds of grey and black , as of a floating mantle stained with blood . The three Isabels , overshadowed and clear cut in a great smoothness confounding the sea and sky , appeared suspended , purple - black , in the air . The little wavelets seemed to be tossing tiny red sparks upon the sandy beaches . The glassy bands of water along the horizon gave out a fiery red glow , as if fire and water had been mingled together in the vast bed of the ocean . At last the conflagration of sea and sky , lying embraced and still in a flaming contact upon the edge of the world , went out . The red sparks in the water vanished together with the stains of blood in the black mantle draping the sombre head of the Placid Gulf ; a sudden breeze sprang up and died out after rustling heavily the growth of bushes on the ruined earthwork of the fort . Nostromo woke up from a fourteen hours ' sleep , and arose full length from his lair in the long grass . He stood knee deep amongst the whispering undulations of the green blades with the lost air of a man just born into the world . Handsome , robust , and supple , he threw back his head , flung his arms open , and stretched himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurely growling yawn of white teeth , as natural and free from evil in the moment of waking as a magnificent and unconscious wild beast . Then , in the suddenly steadied glance fixed upon nothing from under a thoughtful frown , appeared the man . CHAPTER EIGHT After landing from his swim Nostromo had scrambled up , all dripping , into the main quadrangle of the old fort ; and there , amongst ruined bits of walls and rotting remnants of roofs and sheds , he had slept the day through . He had slept in the shadow of the mountains , in the white blaze of noon , in the stillness and solitude of that overgrown piece of land between the oval of the harbour and the spacious semi - circle of the gulf . He lay as if dead . A rey - zamuro , appearing like a tiny black speck in the blue , stooped , circling prudently with a stealthiness of flight startling in a bird of that great size . The shadow of his pearly - white body , of his black - tipped wings , fell on the grass no more silently than he alighted himself on a hillock of rubbish within three yards of that man , lying as still as a corpse . The bird stretched his bare neck , craned his bald head , loathsome in the brilliance of varied colouring , with an air of voracious anxiety towards the promising stillness of that prostrate body . Then , sinking his head deeply into his soft plumage , he settled himself to wait . The first thing upon which Nostromo 's eyes fell on waking was this patient watcher for the signs of death and corruption . When the man got up the vulture hopped away in great , side - long , fluttering jumps . He lingered for a while , morose and reluctant , before he rose , circling noiselessly with a sinister droop of beak and claws . Long after he had vanished , Nostromo , lifting his eyes up to the sky , muttered , "
147109	147923	147103	147103	I	0	" The Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores had lived in splendour and publicity up to the very moment , as it were , when he took charge of the lighter containing the treasure of silver ingots . The last act he had performed in Sulaco was in complete harmony with his vanity , and as such perfectly genuine . He had given his last dollar to an old woman moaning with the grief and fatigue of a dismal search under the arch of the ancient gate . Performed in obscurity and without witnesses , it had still the characteristics of splendour and publicity , and was in strict keeping with his reputation . But this awakening in solitude , except for the watchful vulture , amongst the ruins of the fort , had no such characteristics . His first confused feeling was exactly this - that it was not in keeping . It was more like the end of things . The necessity of living concealed somehow , for God knows how long , which assailed him on his return to consciousness , made everything that had gone before for years appear vain and foolish , like a flattering dream come suddenly to an end . He climbed the crumbling slope of the rampart , and , putting aside the bushes , looked upon the harbour . He saw a couple of ships at anchor upon the sheet of water reflecting the last gleams of light , and Sotillo 's steamer moored to the jetty . And behind the pale long front of the Custom House , there appeared the extent of the town like a grove of thick timber on the plain with a gateway in front , and the cupolas , towers , and miradors rising above the trees , all dark , as if surrendered already to the night . The thought that it was no longer open to him to ride through the streets , recognized by everyone , great and little , as he used to do every evening on his way to play monte in the posada of the Mexican Domingo ; or to sit in the place of honour , listening to songs and looking at dances , made it appear to him as a town that had no existence . For a long time he gazed on , then let the parted bushes spring back , and , crossing over to the other side of the fort , surveyed the vaster emptiness of the great gulf . The Isabels stood out heavily upon the narrowing long band of red in the west , which gleamed low between their black shapes , and the Capataz thought of Decoud alone there with the treasure . That man was the only one who cared whether he fell into the hands of the Monterists or not , the Capataz reflected bitterly . And that merely would be an anxiety for his own sake . As to the rest , they neither knew nor cared . What he had heard Giorgio Viola say once was very true . Kings , ministers , aristocrats , the rich in general , kept the people in poverty and subjection ; they kept them as they kept dogs , to fight and hunt for their service . The darkness of the sky had descended to the line of the horizon , enveloping the whole gulf , the islets , and the lover of Antonia alone with the treasure on the Great Isabel . The Capataz , turning his back on these things invisible and existing , sat down and took his face between his fists . He felt the pinch of poverty for the first time in his life . To find himself without money after a run of bad luck at monte in the low , smoky room of Domingo 's posada , where the fraternity of Cargadores gambled , sang , and danced of an evening ; to remain with empty pockets after a burst of public generosity to some peyne d'oro girl or other for whom he did not care , had none of the humiliation of destitution . He remained rich in glory and reputation . But since it was no longer possible for him to parade the streets of the town , and be hailed with respect in the usual haunts of his leisure , this sailor felt himself destitute indeed . His mouth was dry . It was dry with heavy sleep and extremely anxious thinking , as it had never been dry before . It may be said that Nostromo tasted the dust and ashes of the fruit of life into which he had bitten deeply in his hunger for praise . Without removing his head from between his fists , he tried to spit before him - "
147925	148660	148666	148666	They	4248	" - and muttered a curse upon the selfishness of all the rich people . Since everything seemed lost in Sulaco and that was the feeling of his waking , the idea of leaving the country altogether had presented itself to Nostromo . At that thought he had seen , like the beginning of another dream , a vision of steep and tideless shores , with dark pines on the heights and white houses low down near a very blue sea . He saw the quays of a big port , where the coasting feluccas , with their lateen sails outspread like motionless wings , enter gliding silently between the end of long moles of squared blocks that project angularly towards each other , hugging a cluster of shipping to the superb bosom of a hill covered with palaces . He remembered these sights not without some filial emotion , though he had been habitually and severely beaten as a boy on one of these feluccas by a short - necked , shaven Genoese , with a deliberate and distrustful manner , who he firmly believed had cheated him out of his orphan 's inheritance . But it is mercifully decreed that the evils of the past should appear but faintly in retrospect . Under the sense of loneliness , abandonment , and failure , the idea of return to these things appeared tolerable . But , what ? Return ? With bare feet and head , with one check shirt and a pair of cotton calzoneros for all worldly possessions ? The renowned Capataz , his elbows on his knees and a fist dug into each cheek , laughed with self - derision , as he had spat with disgust , straight out before him into the night . The confused and intimate impressions of universal dissolution which beset a subjective nature at any strong check to its ruling passion had a bitterness approaching that of death itself . He was simple . He was as ready to become the prey of any belief , superstition , or desire as a child . The facts of his situation he could appreciate like a man with a distinct experience of the country . He saw them clearly . He was as if sobered after a long bout of intoxication . His fidelity had been taken advantage of . He had persuaded the body of Cargadores to side with the Blancos against the rest of the people ; he had had interviews with Don Jose ; he had been made use of by Father Corbelan for negotiating with Hernandez ; it was known that Don Martin Decoud had admitted him to a sort of intimacy , so that he had been free of the offices of the Porvenir . All these things had flattered him in the usual way . What did he care about their politics ? Nothing at all . And at the end of it all - Nostromo here and Nostromo there - where is Nostromo ? Nostromo can do this and that - work all day and ride all night - behold ! he found himself a marked Ribierist for any sort of vengeance Gamacho , for instance , would choose to take , now the Montero party , had , after all , mastered the town . The Europeans had given up ; the Caballeros had given up . Don Martin had indeed explained it was only temporary - that he was going to bring Barrios to the rescue . Where was that now - with Don Martin whose ironic manner of talk had always made the Capataz feel vaguely uneasy stranded on the Great Isabel ? Everybody had given up . Even Don Carlos had given up . The hurried removal of the treasure out to sea meant nothing else than that . The Capataz de Cargadores , on a revulsion of subjectiveness , exasperated almost to insanity , beheld all his world without faith and courage . He had been betrayed ! With the boundless shadows of the sea behind him , out of his silence and immobility , facing the lofty shapes of the lower peaks crowded around the white , misty sheen of Higuerota , Nostromo laughed aloud again , sprang abruptly to his feet , and stood still . He must go . But where ? "
148690	148794	148795	148795	Teresa	433	" he said , slowly and scathingly . He remembered old Giorgio taking his pipe out of his mouth to throw these words over his shoulder at the cafe , full of engine - drivers and fitters from the railway workshops . This image fixed his wavering purpose . He would try to find old Giorgio if he could . God knows what might have happened to him ! He made a few steps , then stopped again and shook his head . To the left and right , in front and behind him , the scrubby bush rustled mysteriously in the darkness . "
148801	148859	148795	148795	Teresa	433	" he added in a low tone touched with awe . He wondered whether she was dead in her anger with him or still alive . As if in answer to this thought , half of remorse and half of hope , with a soft flutter and oblique flight , a big owl , whose appalling cry : "
148876	150109	148795	148795	Teresa	433	" - announces calamity and death in the popular belief , drifted vaguely like a large dark ball across his path . In the downfall of all the realities that made his force , he was affected by the superstition , and shuddered slightly . Signora Teresa must have died , then . It could mean nothing else . The cry of the ill - omened bird , the first sound he was to hear on his return , was a fitting welcome for his betrayed individuality . The unseen powers which he had offended by refusing to bring a priest to a dying woman were lifting up their voice against him . She was dead . With admirable and human consistency he referred everything to himself . She had been a woman of good counsel always . And the bereaved old Giorgio remained stunned by his loss just as he was likely to require the advice of his sagacity . The blow would render the dreamy old man quite stupid for a time . As to Captain Mitchell , Nostromo , after the manner of trusted subordinates , considered him as a person fitted by education perhaps to sign papers in an office and to give orders , but otherwise of no use whatever , and something of a fool . The necessity of winding round his little finger , almost daily , the pompous and testy self - importance of the old seaman had grown irksome with use to Nostromo . At first it had given him an inward satisfaction . But the necessity of overcoming small obstacles becomes wearisome to a self - confident personality as much by the certitude of success as by the monotony of effort . He mistrusted his superior 's proneness to fussy action . That old Englishman had no judgment , he said to himself . It was useless to suppose that , acquainted with the true state of the case , he would keep it to himself . He would talk of doing impracticable things . Nostromo feared him as one would fear saddling one 's self with some persistent worry . He had no discretion . He would betray the treasure . And Nostromo had made up his mind that the treasure should not be betrayed . The word had fixed itself tenaciously in his intelligence . His imagination had seized upon the clear and simple notion of betrayal to account for the dazed feeling of enlightenment as to being done for , of having inadvertently gone out of his existence on an issue in which his personality had not been taken into account . A man betrayed is a man destroyed . Signora Teresa may God have her soul ! had been right . He had never been taken into account . Destroyed ! Her white form sitting up bowed in bed , the falling black hair , the wide - browed suffering face raised to him , the anger of her denunciations appeared to him now majestic with the awfulness of inspiration and of death . For it was not for nothing that the evil bird had uttered its lamentable shriek over his head . She was dead - may God have her soul ! Sharing in the anti - priestly freethought of the masses , his mind used the pious formula from the superficial force of habit , but with a deep - seated sincerity . The popular mind is incapable of scepticism ; and that incapacity delivers their helpless strength to the wiles of swindlers and to the pitiless enthusiasms of leaders inspired by visions of a high destiny . She was dead . But would God consent to receive her soul ? She had died without confession or absolution , because he had not been willing to spare her another moment of his time . His scorn of priests as priests remained ; but after all , it was impossible to know whether what they affirmed was not true . Power , punishment , pardon , are simple and credible notions . The magnificent Capataz de Cargadores , deprived of certain simple realities , such as the admiration of women , the adulation of men , the admired publicity of his life , was ready to feel the burden of sacrilegious guilt descend upon his shoulders . Bareheaded , in a thin shirt and drawers , he felt the lingering warmth of the fine sand under the soles of his feet . The narrow strand gleamed far ahead in a long curve , defining the outline of this wild side of the harbour . He flitted along the shore like a pursued shadow between the sombre palm - groves and the sheet of water lying as still as death on his right hand . He strode with headlong haste in the silence and solitude as though he had forgotten all prudence and caution . But he knew that on this side of the water he ran no risk of discovery . The only inhabitant was a lonely , silent , apathetic Indian in charge of the palmarias , who brought sometimes a load of cocoanuts to the town for sale . He lived without a woman in an open shed , with a perpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering near an old canoe lying bottom up on the beach . He could be easily avoided . The barking of the dogs about that man 's ranche was the first thing that checked his speed . He had forgotten the dogs . He swerved sharply , and plunged into the palm - grove , as into a wilderness of columns in an immense hall , whose dense obscurity seemed to whisper and rustle faintly high above his head . He traversed it , entered a ravine , and climbed to the top of a steep ridge free of trees and bushes . From there , open and vague in the starlight , he saw the plain between the town and the harbour . In the woods above some night - bird made a strange drumming noise . Below beyond the palmaria on the beach , the Indian 's dogs continued to bark uproariously . He wondered what had upset them so much , and , peering down from his elevation , was surprised to detect unaccountable movements of the ground below , as if several oblong pieces of the plain had been in motion . Those dark , shifting patches , alternately catching and eluding the eye , altered their place always away from the harbour , with a suggestion of consecutive order and purpose . A light dawned upon him . It was a column of infantry on a night march towards the higher broken country at the foot of the hills . But he was too much in the dark about everything for wonder and speculation . The plain had resumed its shadowy immobility . He descended the ridge and found himself in the open solitude , between the harbour and the town . Its spaciousness , extended indefinitely by an effect of obscurity , rendered more sensible his profound isolation . His pace became slower . No one waited for him ; no one thought of him ; no one expected or wished his return . "
150114	151083	148795	148795	Teresa	433	" he muttered to himself . No one cared . He might have been drowned by this time . No one would have cared - unless , perhaps , the children , he thought to himself . But they were with the English signora , and not thinking of him at all . He wavered in his purpose of making straight for the Casa Viola . To what end ? What could he expect there ? His life seemed to fail him in all its details , even to the scornful reproaches of Teresa . He was aware painfully of his reluctance . Was it that remorse which she had prophesied with , what he saw now , was her last breath ? Meantime , he had deviated from the straight course , inclining by a sort of instinct to the right , towards the jetty and the harbour , the scene of his daily labours . The great length of the Custom House loomed up all at once like the wall of a factory . Not a soul challenged his approach , and his curiosity became excited as he passed cautiously towards the front by the unexpected sight of two lighted windows . They had the fascination of a lonely vigil kept by some mysterious watcher up there , those two windows shining dimly upon the harbour in the whole vast extent of the abandoned building . The solitude could almost be felt . A strong smell of wood smoke hung about in a thin haze , which was faintly perceptible to his raised eyes against the glitter of the stars . As he advanced in the profound silence , the shrilling of innumerable cicalas in the dry grass seemed positively deafening to his strained ears . Slowly , step by step , he found himself in the great hall , sombre and full of acrid smoke . A fire built against the staircase had burnt down impotently to a low heap of embers . The hard wood had failed to catch ; only a few steps at the bottom smouldered , with a creeping glow of sparks defining their charred edges . At the top he saw a streak of light from an open door . It fell upon the vast landing , all foggy with a slow drift of smoke . That was the room . He climbed the stairs , then checked himself , because he had seen within the shadow of a man cast upon one of the walls . It was a shapeless , high - shouldered shadow of somebody standing still , with lowered head , out of his line of sight . The Capataz , remembering that he was totally unarmed , stepped aside , and , effacing himself upright in a dark corner , waited with his eyes fixed on the door . The whole enormous ruined barrack of a place , unfinished , without ceilings under its lofty roof , was pervaded by the smoke swaying to and fro in the faint cross draughts playing in the obscurity of many lofty rooms and barnlike passages . Once one of the swinging shutters came against the wall with a single sharp crack , as if pushed by an impatient hand . A piece of paper scurried out from somewhere , rustling along the landing . The man , whoever he was , did not darken the lighted doorway . Twice the Capataz , advancing a couple of steps out of his corner , craned his neck in the hope of catching sight of what he could be at , so quietly , in there . But every time he saw only the distorted shadow of broad shoulders and bowed head . He was doing apparently nothing , and stirred not from the spot , as though he were meditating - or , perhaps , reading a paper . And not a sound issued from the room . Once more the Capataz stepped back . He wondered who it was - some Monterist ? But he dreaded to show himself . To discover his presence on shore , unless after many days , would , he believed , endanger the treasure . With his own knowledge possessing his whole soul , it seemed impossible that anybody in Sulaco should fail to jump at the right surmise . After a couple of weeks or so it would be different . Who could tell he had not returned overland from some port beyond the limits of the Republic ? The existence of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiar sort of anxiety , as though his life had become bound up with it . It rendered him timorous for a moment before that enigmatic , lighted door . Devil take the fellow ! He did not want to see him . There would be nothing to learn from his face , known or unknown . He was a fool to waste his time there in waiting . Less than five minutes after entering the place the Capataz began his retreat . He got away down the stairs with perfect success , gave one upward look over his shoulder at the light on the landing , and ran stealthily across the hall . But at the very moment he was turning out of the great door , with his mind fixed upon escaping the notice of the man upstairs , somebody he had not heard coming briskly along the front ran full into him . Both muttered a stifled exclamation of surprise , and leaped back and stood still , each indistinct to the other . Nostromo was silent . The other man spoke first , in an amazed and deadened tone . "
151088	151156	151086	151086	you	4252	" Already Nostromo had seemed to recognize Dr. Monygham . He had no doubt now . He hesitated the space of a second . The idea of bolting without a word presented itself to his mind . No use ! An inexplicable repugnance to pronounce the name by which he was known kept him silent a little longer . At last he said in a low voice - "
151160	151293	151086	151086	you	4252	" He walked up to the other . Dr. Monygham had received a shock . He flung his arms up and cried out his wonder aloud , forgetting himself before the marvel of this meeting . Nostromo angrily warned him to moderate his voice . The Custom House was not so deserted as it looked . There was somebody in the lighted room above . There is no more evanescent quality in an accomplished fact than its wonderfulness . Solicited incessantly by the considerations affecting its fears and desires , the human mind turns naturally away from the marvellous side of events . And it was in the most natural way possible that the doctor asked this man whom only two minutes before he believed to have been drowned in the gulf - "
151304	151305	151302	151302	you	4253	" "
151314	151315	151312	151312	him	4254	" "
151322	151323	151319	151319	you	4253	" "
151335	151336	151337	151337	His	4254	" "
151340	151341	151337	151337	His	4254	" "
151351	151390	151344	151344	His	4254	" said Nostromo , in a contemptuous tone . Leaning back with folded arms at the foot of the immense building , he dropped his head , biting his lips slightly , and not looking at the doctor . "
151393	151399	151400	151400	he	4254	" he thought to himself , "
151409	151484	151400	151400	he	4254	" But the doctor 's thoughts were concerned with an event not as marvellous as Nostromo 's appearance , but in itself much less clear . Why had Sotillo taken himself off with his whole command with this suddenness and secrecy ? What did this move portend ? However , it dawned upon the doctor that the man upstairs was one of the officers left behind by the disappointed colonel to communicate with him . "
151493	151497	151487	151487	he	4254	" he said . "
151502	151503	151504	151504	I	0	" "
151516	151517	151514	151514	Capataz	251	" "
151522	151574	151575	151575	Capataz	251	" muttered Nostromo . Already the doctor had left him . He remained leaning against the wall , staring at the dark water of the harbour ; the shrilling of cicalas filled his ears . An invincible vagueness coming over his thoughts took from them all power to determine his will . "
151579	151632	151577	151577	Capataz	251	" the doctor 's voice called urgently from above . The sense of betrayal and ruin floated upon his sombre indifference as upon a sluggish sea of pitch . But he stepped out from under the wall , and , looking up , saw Dr. Monygham leaning out of a lighted window . "
151651	151820	151646	151649	the man up here	4257	" He answered by a slight , bitter laugh . Fear a man ! The Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores fear a man ! It angered him that anybody should suggest such a thing . It angered him to be disarmed and skulking and in danger because of the accursed treasure , which was of so little account to the people who had tied it round his neck . He could not shake off the worry of it . To Nostromo the doctor represented all these people . . . . And he had never even asked after it . Not a word of inquiry about the most desperate undertaking of his life . Thinking these thoughts , Nostromo passed again through the cavernous hall , where the smoke was considerably thinned , and went up the stairs , not so warm to his feet now , towards the streak of light at the top . The doctor appeared in it for a moment , agitated and impatient . "
151827	152144	152185	152185	Sotillo	442	" At the moment of crossing the doorway the Capataz experienced a shock of surprise . The man had not moved . He saw his shadow in the same place . He started , then stepped in with a feeling of being about to solve a mystery . It was very simple . For an infinitesimal fraction of a second , against the light of two flaring and guttering candles , through a blue , pungent , thin haze which made his eyes smart , he saw the man standing , as he had imagined him , with his back to the door , casting an enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall . Swifter than a flash of lightning followed the impression of his constrained , toppling attitude - the shoulders projecting forward , the head sunk low upon the breast . Then he distinguished the arms behind his back , and wrenched so terribly that the two clenched fists , lashed together , had been forced up higher than the shoulder - blades . From there his eyes traced in one instantaneous glance the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over a heavy beam and down to a staple in the wall . He did not want to look at the rigid legs , at the feet hanging down nervelessly , with their bare toes some six inches above the floor , to know that the man had been given the estrapade till he had swooned . His first impulse was to dash forward and sever the rope at one blow . He felt for his knife . He had no knife - not even a knife . He stood quivering , and the doctor , perched on the edge of the table , facing thoughtfully the cruel and lamentable sight , his chin in his hand , uttered , without stirring - "
152157	152175	152185	152185	Sotillo	442	" This information calmed the Capataz . One of the candles flickering in the socket went out . "
152180	152184	152185	152185	Sotillo	442	" he asked . "
152203	152217	152219	152219	mark	480	" The doctor looked fixedly at Nostromo , who shrugged his shoulders slightly . "
152238	152249	152250	152250	I	0	" Nostromo had advanced , and stooped slightly to look . "
152259	152263	152250	152250	I	0	" he muttered . "
152268	152278	152266	152266	he	480	" The doctor turned his eyes upon him again . "
152299	152352	152290	152290	you	442	" But Nostromo did not even hear these words . Seizing the remaining light , he thrust it under the drooping head . The doctor sat oblivious , with a lost gaze . Then the heavy iron candlestick , as if struck out of Nostromo 's hand , clattered on the floor . "
152355	152403	152353	152353	Hullo	481	" exclaimed the doctor , looking up with a start . He could hear the Capataz stagger against the table and gasp . In the sudden extinction of the light within , the dead blackness sealing the window - frames became alive with stars to his sight . "
152410	152419	152353	152353	Hullo	481	" the doctor muttered to himself in English . "
152430	152464	152353	152353	Hullo	481	" Nostromo 's heart seemed to force itself into his throat . His head swam . Hirsch ! The man was Hirsch ! He held on tight to the edge of the table . "
152473	152481	152466	152466	he	480	" he almost shouted His voice fell . "
152490	152491	152466	152466	he	480	" "
152498	152503	152493	152493	Sotillo	442	" said the doctor . "
152533	152534	152526	152528	some compassionate soul	4259	" "
152539	152549	152536	152536	Sotillo	442	" began Nostromo , in a more equable voice . "
152552	152568	152536	152536	Sotillo	442	" interrupted the doctor . The Capataz was heard striking the table with his fist . "
152589	152590	152573	152573	you	4258	" "
152698	152699	152683	152683	He	480	" "
152705	152711	152683	152683	He	480	" repeated Nostromo , slowly . "
152718	152769	152716	152716	Bueno	471	" The doctor , a little impatiently , was unable to imagine what else could anybody believe . Yes , Sotillo believed that the lighter was sunk , and the Capataz de Cargadores , together with Martin Decoud and perhaps one or two other political fugitives , had been drowned . "
152778	152785	152770	152770	I	0	" remarked Nostromo at that point , "
152793	152794	152787	152787	Sotillo	442	" "
152802	152803	152799	152799	you	0	" "
152813	152814	152804	152804	He	442	" "
152819	152820	152817	152817	we	4264	" "
152858	152859	152836	152836	you	0	" "
152918	152919	152920	152920	I	0	" "
152925	152930	152920	152920	I	0	" broke in Nostromo . "
152941	152942	152920	152920	I	0	" "
152951	152958	152947	152947	your	0	" the doctor said , roughly . "
152964	153031	152947	152947	your	0	" Their flowing murmurs paused in the dark . Perched on the edge of the table with slightly averted faces , they felt their shoulders touch , and their eyes remained directed towards an upright shape nearly lost in the obscurity of the inner part of the room , that with projecting head and shoulders , in ghastly immobility , seemed intent on catching every word . "
153035	153041	152947	152947	your	0	" Nostromo muttered at last . "
153056	153057	153058	153058	Teresa	271	" "
153062	153091	153092	153092	She	271	" remarked the doctor , absently , while his mind followed a new line of thought suggested by what might have been called Nostromo 's return to life . "
153099	153100	153092	153092	She	271	" "
153105	153112	153102	153103	a priest	8436	" the Capataz asked , anxiously . "
153128	153129	153121	153122	a priest	8436	" "
153136	153170	153131	153131	God	259	" ejaculated Nostromo , with a gloomy and hopeless fervour which had no time to surprise Dr. Monygham , before , reverting to their previous conversation , he continued in a sinister tone , "
153192	153193	153177	153177	you	8423	" "
153217	153759	153177	153177	you	8423	" the doctor said , admiringly . And again there was silence between those two men . They were both reflecting , and the diversity of their natures made their thoughts born from their meeting swing afar from each other . The doctor , impelled to risky action by his loyalty to the Goulds , wondered with thankfulness at the chain of accident which had brought that man back where he would be of the greatest use in the work of saving the San Tome mine . The doctor was loyal to the mine . It presented itself to his fifty - years ' old eyes in the shape of a little woman in a soft dress with a long train , with a head attractively overweighted by a great mass of fair hair and the delicate preciousness of her inner worth , partaking of a gem and a flower , revealed in every attitude of her person . As the dangers thickened round the San Tome mine this illusion acquired force , permanency , and authority . It claimed him at last ! This claim , exalted by a spiritual detachment from the usual sanctions of hope and reward , made Dr. Monygham 's thinking , acting , individuality extremely dangerous to himself and to others , all his scruples vanishing in the proud feeling that his devotion was the only thing that stood between an admirable woman and a frightful disaster . It was a sort of intoxication which made him utterly indifferent to Decoud 's fate , but left his wits perfectly clear for the appreciation of Decoud 's political idea . It was a good idea - and Barrios was the only instrument of its realization . The doctor 's soul , withered and shrunk by the shame of a moral disgrace , became implacable in the expansion of its tenderness . Nostromo 's return was providential . He did not think of him humanely , as of a fellow - creature just escaped from the jaws of death . The Capataz for him was the only possible messenger to Cayta . The very man . The doctor 's misanthropic mistrust of mankind the bitterer because based on personal failure did not lift him sufficiently above common weaknesses . He was under the spell of an established reputation . Trumpeted by Captain Mitchell , grown in repetition , and fixed in general assent , Nostromo 's faithfulness had never been questioned by Dr. Monygham as a fact . It was not likely to be questioned now he stood in desperate need of it himself . Dr. Monygham was human ; he accepted the popular conception of the Capataz 's incorruptibility simply because no word or fact had ever contradicted a mere affirmation . It seemed to be a part of the man , like his whiskers or his teeth . It was impossible to conceive him otherwise . The question was whether he would consent to go on such a dangerous and desperate errand . The doctor was observant enough to have become aware from the first of something peculiar in the man 's temper . He was no doubt sore about the loss of the silver . "
153772	153821	153899	153899	Capataz	251	" he said to himself , with a certain acuteness of insight into the nature he had to deal with . On Nostromo 's side the silence had been full of black irresolution , anger , and mistrust . He was the first to break it , however . "
153829	153833	153899	153899	Capataz	251	" he said . "
153846	153894	153899	153899	Capataz	251	" He did not quite finish what he meant to say , breaking off short , as though his thought had butted against a solid obstacle . The doctor 's mind pursued its own schemes with Machiavellian subtlety . He said as sympathetically as he was able - "
153948	153949	153930	153930	Decoud	257	" "
153952	153961	153930	153930	Decoud	257	" assented Nostromo , as the doctor paused , "
153979	153980	153981	153981	You	251	" "
153997	154227	153995	153995	himself	4282	" In this Dr. Monygham was sincere . He esteemed highly the intrepidity of that man , whom he valued but little , being disillusioned as to mankind in general , because of the particular instance in which his own manhood had failed . Having had to encounter singlehanded during his period of eclipse many physical dangers , he was well aware of the most dangerous element common to them all : of the crushing , paralyzing sense of human littleness , which is what really defeats a man struggling with natural forces , alone , far from the eyes of his fellows . He was eminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himself of the Capataz , after hours of tension and anxiety , precipitated suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness , without earth or sky , and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind , but with sensible success . Of course , the man was an incomparable swimmer , that was known , but the doctor judged that this instance testified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit . It was pleasing to him ; he augured well from it for the success of the arduous mission with which he meant to entrust the Capataz so marvellously restored to usefulness . And in a tone vaguely gratified , he observed - "
154235	154236	153995	153995	himself	4282	" "
154246	154355	154356	154356	I	0	" the Capataz assented , briefly . He was mollified by what seemed a sign of some faint interest in such things as had befallen him , and dropped a few descriptive phrases with an affected and curt nonchalance . At that moment he felt communicative . He expected the continuance of that interest which , whether accepted or rejected , would have restored to him his personality - the only thing lost in that desperate affair . But the doctor , engrossed by a desperate adventure of his own , was terrible in the pursuit of his idea . He let an exclamation of regret escape him . "
154368	154392	154360	154360	you	0	" This unexpected utterance astounded the Capataz by its character of cold - blooded atrocity . It was as much as to say , "
154414	154466	154404	154404	you	0	" Naturally he referred it to himself , whereas it related only to the silver , being uttered simply and with many mental reservations . Surprise and rage rendered him speechless , and the doctor pursued , practically unheard by Nostromo , whose stirred blood was beating violently in his ears . "
154563	154612	154561	154561	Capataz	251	" The Capataz had mastered the fury that was like a tempest in his ears in time to hear the name of Don Carlos . He seemed to have come out of it a changed man - a man who spoke thoughtfully in a soft and even voice . "
154627	154628	154629	154629	I	0	" "
154644	154651	154634	154634	they	4286	" the doctor said , grimly . "
154708	154709	154748	154748	Capataz	251	" "
154714	154726	154748	154748	Capataz	251	" repeated the Capataz very low ; then raised his voice . "
154742	154743	154744	154744	I	0	" "
154750	154826	154746	154746	you	0	" said the doctor , drily . He went on to develop his view of Sotillo 's dangerous influence upon the situation . And the Capataz , listening as if in a dream , felt himself of as little account as the indistinct , motionless shape of the dead man whom he saw upright under the beam , with his air of listening also , disregarded , forgotten , like a terrible example of neglect . "
154843	154848	154836	154836	they	4289	" he interrupted suddenly . "
154908	154909	154917	154917	his	257	" "
154920	154927	154928	154928	Si	432	" the doctor reminded him again . "

154981	154986	154976	154976	I	0	" the doctor began . "
154990	155002	154988	154988	Capataz	251	" broke in Nostromo , in a forcible but even voice . "
155027	155028	155022	155023	the Capataz	251	" "
155035	155047	155048	155048	I	0	" remonstrated the doctor ; and the other calmed down suddenly . "
155057	155093	155048	155048	I	0	" he muttered . And as his eyes met again the shape of the murdered man suspended in his awful immobility , which seemed the uncomplaining immobility of attention , he asked , wondering gently - "
155146	155147	155140	155140	He	442	" "
155192	155193	155180	155180	Sotillo	442	" "
155207	155208	155209	155209	I	0	" "
155229	155230	155219	155219	He	543	" "
155233	155243	155219	155219	He	543	" the Capataz cried out in a discomposed tone . "
155250	155251	155219	155219	He	543	" "
155259	155275	155253	155253	I	0	" Nostromo went on in a deliberate and , as it were , watchful tone , "
155288	155289	155277	155277	Sotillo	442	" "
155299	155316	155322	155322	He	442	" said the doctor , with conviction ; and Nostromo emitted a grunt in the dark . "
155392	155393	155386	155386	he	442	" "
155418	155422	155423	155423	He	442	" growled Nostromo . "
155433	155438	155439	155439	He	442	" said the doctor . "
155526	155527	155528	155528	You	4313	" "
155531	155539	155528	155528	You	4313	" the Capataz de Cargadores repeated cautiously . "
155560	155561	155550	155550	you	4313	" "
155568	155569	155565	155565	I	0	" "
155575	155576	155565	155565	I	0	" "
155589	155619	155620	155620	I	0	" the doctor retorted in a stubborn voice . Then , in a few words , he described the story of his arrest and the circumstances of his release . "
155632	155643	155625	155627	that silly scoundrel	4314	" he concluded . Nostromo had listened with profound attention . "
155658	155666	155648	155648	your	4313	" he muttered through his clenched teeth . "
155673	155680	155648	155648	your	4313	" the doctor said , testily . "
155698	155699	155681	155681	You	4313	" "
155703	155713	155681	155681	You	4313	" mumbled Nostromo , loud enough to be overheard . "
155729	155730	155720	155721	two fools	4317	" "
155737	155744	155734	155734	my	0	" said the doctor , curtly . "
155757	155761	155762	155762	I	0	" retorted Nostromo . "
155799	155881	155788	155788	you	471	" Nostromo had a great distaste for the doctor 's sardonic treatment of his great reputation . Decoud 's faintly ironic recognition used to make him uneasy ; but the familiarity of a man like Don Martin was flattering , whereas the doctor was a nobody . He could remember him a penniless outcast , slinking about the streets of Sulaco , without a single friend or acquaintance , till Don Carlos Gould took him into the service of the mine . "
155888	155915	155882	155882	You	0	" he went on , thoughtfully , staring into the obscurity of the room , pervaded by the gruesome enigma of the tortured and murdered Hirsch . "
155945	155957	155941	155943	a dangerous man	4324	" Dr. Monygham was too startled to do more than exclaim - "
155964	155965	155961	155961	you	0	" "
155977	155994	155970	155970	he	4325	" pursued Nostromo , with a nod of his shadowy head silhouetted against the starlit window . "
156001	156008	155999	155999	you	0	" said Dr. Monygham , faintly . "
156039	156083	156023	156023	he	442	" The doctor started at the suggestion . But his devotion , absorbing all his sensibilities , had left his heart steeled against remorse and pity . Still , for complete relief , he felt the necessity of repelling it loudly and contemptuously . "
156156	156294	156148	156148	I	0	" This is what Dr. Monygham said in answer to Nostromo 's remark , which was plausible enough to prick his conscience . He was not a callous man . But the necessity , the magnitude , the importance of the task he had taken upon himself dwarfed all merely humane considerations . He had undertaken it in a fanatical spirit . He did not like it . To lie , to deceive , to circumvent even the basest of mankind was odious to him . It was odious to him by training , instinct , and tradition . To do these things in the character of a traitor was abhorrent to his nature and terrible to his feelings . He had made that sacrifice in a spirit of abasement . He had said to himself bitterly , "
156306	156414	156295	156295	I	0	" And he believed this . He was not subtle . His simplicity was such that , though he had no sort of heroic idea of seeking death , the risk , deadly enough , to which he exposed himself , had a sustaining and comforting effect . To that spiritual state the fate of Hirsch presented itself as part of the general atrocity of things . He considered that episode practically . What did it mean ? Was it a sign of some dangerous change in Sotillo 's delusion ? That the man should have been killed like this was what the doctor could not understand . "
156421	156724	156142	156142	I	0	" he murmured to himself . Nostromo kept very still . CHAPTER NINE Distracted between doubts and hopes , dismayed by the sound of bells pealing out the arrival of Pedrito Montero , Sotillo had spent the morning in battling with his thoughts ; a contest to which he was unequal , from the vacuity of his mind and the violence of his passions . Disappointment , greed , anger , and fear made a tumult , in the colonel 's breast louder than the din of bells in the town . Nothing he had planned had come to pass . Neither Sulaco nor the silver of the mine had fallen into his hands . He had performed no military exploit to secure his position , and had obtained no enormous booty to make off with . Pedrito Montero , either as friend or foe , filled him with dread . The sound of bells maddened him . Imagining at first that he might be attacked at once , he had made his battalion stand to arms on the shore . He walked to and fro all the length of the room , stopping sometimes to gnaw the finger - tips of his right hand with a lurid sideways glare fixed on the floor ; then , with a sullen , repelling glance all round , he would resume his tramping in savage aloofness . His hat , horsewhip , sword , and revolver were lying on the table . His officers , crowding the window giving the view of the town gate , disputed amongst themselves the use of his field - glass bought last year on long credit from Anzani . It passed from hand to hand , and the possessor for the time being was besieged by anxious inquiries . "
156735	156850	156142	156142	I	0	" he would repeat impatiently . There was nothing . And when the picket in the bushes near the Casa Viola had been ordered to fall back upon the main body , no stir of life appeared on the stretch of dusty and arid land between the town and the waters of the port . But late in the afternoon a horseman issuing from the gate was made out riding up fearlessly . It was an emissary from Senor Fuentes . Being all alone he was allowed to come on . Dismounting at the great door he greeted the silent bystanders with cheery impudence , and begged to be taken up at once to the "
156853	156925	156142	156142	I	0	" colonel . Senor Fuentes , on entering upon his functions of Gefe Politico , had turned his diplomatic abilities to getting hold of the harbour as well as of the mine . The man he pitched upon to negotiate with Sotillo was a Notary Public , whom the revolution had found languishing in the common jail on a charge of forging documents . Liberated by the mob along with the other "
156931	157323	156142	156142	I	0	" he had hastened to offer his services to the new Government . He set out determined to display much zeal and eloquence in trying to induce Sotillo to come into town alone for a conference with Pedrito Montero . Nothing was further from the colonel 's intentions . The mere fleeting idea of trusting himself into the famous Pedrito 's hands had made him feel unwell several times . It was out of the question - it was madness . And to put himself in open hostility was madness , too . It would render impossible a systematic search for that treasure , for that wealth of silver which he seemed to feel somewhere about , to scent somewhere near . But where ? Where ? Heavens ! Where ? Oh ! why had he allowed that doctor to go ! Imbecile that he was . But no ! It was the only right course , he reflected distractedly , while the messenger waited downstairs chatting agreeably to the officers . It was in that scoundrelly doctor 's true interest to return with positive information . But what if anything stopped him ? A general prohibition to leave the town , for instance ! There would be patrols ! The colonel , seizing his head in his hands , turned in his tracks as if struck with vertigo . A flash of craven inspiration suggested to him an expedient not unknown to European statesmen when they wish to delay a difficult negotiation . Booted and spurred , he scrambled into the hammock with undignified haste . His handsome face had turned yellow with the strain of weighty cares . The ridge of his shapely nose had grown sharp ; the audacious nostrils appeared mean and pinched . The velvety , caressing glance of his fine eyes seemed dead , and even decomposed ; for these almond - shaped , languishing orbs had become inappropriately bloodshot with much sinister sleeplessness . He addressed the surprised envoy of Senor Fuentes in a deadened , exhausted voice . It came pathetically feeble from under a pile of ponchos , which buried his elegant person right up to the black moustaches , uncurled , pendant , in sign of bodily prostration and mental incapacity . Fever , fever - a heavy fever had overtaken the "
157326	157735	157736	157736	Caballeros	384	" colonel . A wavering wildness of expression , caused by the passing spasms of a slight colic which had declared itself suddenly , and the rattling teeth of repressed panic , had a genuineness which impressed the envoy . It was a cold fit . The colonel explained that he was unable to think , to listen , to speak . With an appearance of superhuman effort the colonel gasped out that he was not in a state to return a suitable reply or to execute any of his Excellency 's orders . But to - morrow ! To - morrow ! Ah ! to - morrow ! Let his Excellency Don Pedro be without uneasiness . The brave Esmeralda Regiment held the harbour , held - And closing his eyes , he rolled his aching head like a half - delirious invalid under the inquisitive stare of the envoy , who was obliged to bend down over the hammock in order to catch the painful and broken accents . Meantime , Colonel Sotillo trusted that his Excellency 's humanity would permit the doctor , the English doctor , to come out of town with his case of foreign remedies to attend upon him . He begged anxiously his worship the caballero now present for the grace of looking in as he passed the Casa Gould , and informing the English doctor , who was probably there , that his services were immediately required by Colonel Sotillo , lying ill of fever in the Custom House . Immediately . Most urgently required . Awaited with extreme impatience . A thousand thanks . He closed his eyes wearily and would not open them again , lying perfectly still , deaf , dumb , insensible , overcome , vanquished , crushed , annihilated by the fell disease . But as soon as the other had shut after him the door of the landing , the colonel leaped out with a fling of both feet in an avalanche of woollen coverings . His spurs having become entangled in a perfect welter of ponchos he nearly pitched on his head , and did not recover his balance till the middle of the room . Concealed behind the half - closed jalousies he listened to what went on below . The envoy had already mounted , and turning to the morose officers occupying the great doorway , took off his hat formally . "
157738	157748	157736	157736	Caballeros	384	" he said , in a very loud tone , "
157851	157916	157987	157995	hombre de muchos dientes . ' Si , senor	4337	" But he reined in his horse and inclined his head sideways on seeing the old major step out , very tall and meagre , in a straight narrow coat coming down to his ankles as it were the casing of the regimental colours rolled round their staff . The intelligent old warrior , after enunciating in a dogmatic tone the general proposition that the "
157923	157964	157921	157921	traitors	4335	" went on pronouncing deliberately a panegyric upon Sotillo . He ascribed to him with leisurely emphasis every virtue under heaven , summing it all up in an absurd colloquialism current amongst the lower class of Occidentals especially about Esmeralda . "
157967	157979	157980	157984	a man of many teeth	4336	" he concluded , with a sudden rise in the voice , "
158001	158009	158010	158010	your	4339	" he pursued , portentous and impressive , "
158038	158039	158031	158035	y hombres de muchos dientes	4344	" "
158046	158062	158063	158063	Todos	483	" inquired the disreputable envoy of Senor Fuentes , with a faint , derisive smile . "
158069	158079	158067	158067	senor	1479	" the major affirmed , gravely , with conviction . "
158085	158202	158080	158083	Men of many teeth	4347	" The other wheeled his horse to face the portal resembling the high gate of a dismal barn . He raised himself in his stirrups , extended one arm . He was a facetious scoundrel , entertaining for these stupid Occidentals a feeling of great scorn natural in a native from the central provinces . The folly of Esmeraldians especially aroused his amused contempt . He began an oration upon Pedro Montero , keeping a solemn countenance . He flourished his hand as if introducing him to their notice . And when he saw every face set , all the eyes fixed upon his lips , he began to shout a sort of catalogue of perfections : "
158210	158219	158220	158221	a statesman	1070	" - he snatched off his hat enthusiastically - "
158229	158242	158244	158245	a dentist	4350	" He dropped his voice startlingly to a deep , hollow note - "
158247	159001	158244	158245	a dentist	4350	" He was off instantly at a smart walk ; the rigid straddle of his legs , the turned - out feet , the stiff back , the rakish slant of the sombrero above the square , motionless set of the shoulders expressing an infinite , awe - inspiring impudence . Upstairs , behind the jalousies , Sotillo did not move for a long time . The audacity of the fellow appalled him . What were his officers saying below ? They were saying nothing . Complete silence . He quaked . It was not thus that he had imagined himself at that stage of the expedition . He had seen himself triumphant , unquestioned , appeased , the idol of the soldiers , weighing in secret complacency the agreeable alternatives of power and wealth open to his choice . Alas ! How different ! Distracted , restless , supine , burning with fury , or frozen with terror , he felt a dread as fathomless as the sea creep upon him from every side . That rogue of a doctor had to come out with his information . That was clear . It would be of no use to him - alone . He could do nothing with it . Malediction ! The doctor would never come out . He was probably under arrest already , shut up together with Don Carlos . He laughed aloud insanely . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! It was Pedrito Montero who would get the information . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! - and the silver . Ha ! All at once , in the midst of the laugh , he became motionless and silent as if turned into stone . He too , had a prisoner . A prisoner who must , must know the real truth . He would have to be made to speak . And Sotillo , who all that time had not quite forgotten Hirsch , felt an inexplicable reluctance at the notion of proceeding to extremities . He felt a reluctance - part of that unfathomable dread that crept on all sides upon him . He remembered reluctantly , too , the dilated eyes of the hide merchant , his contortions , his loud sobs and protestations . It was not compassion or even mere nervous sensibility . The fact was that though Sotillo did never for a moment believe his story - he could not believe it ; nobody could believe such nonsense - yet those accents of despairing truth impressed him disagreeably . They made him feel sick . And he suspected also that the man might have gone mad with fear . A lunatic is a hopeless subject . Bah ! A pretence . Nothing but a pretence . He would know how to deal with that . He was working himself up to the right pitch of ferocity . His fine eyes squinted slightly ; he clapped his hands ; a bare - footed orderly appeared noiselessly , a corporal , with his bayonet hanging on his thigh and a stick in his hand . The colonel gave his orders , and presently the miserable Hirsch , pushed in by several soldiers , found him frowning awfully in a broad armchair , hat on head , knees wide apart , arms akimbo , masterful , imposing , irresistible , haughty , sublime , terrible . Hirsch , with his arms tied behind his back , had been bundled violently into one of the smaller rooms . For many hours he remained apparently forgotten , stretched lifelessly on the floor . From that solitude , full of despair and terror , he was torn out brutally , with kicks and blows , passive , sunk in hebetude . He listened to threats and admonitions , and afterwards made his usual answers to questions , with his chin sunk on his breast , his hands tied behind his back , swaying a little in front of Sotillo , and never looking up . When he was forced to hold up his head , by means of a bayonet - point prodding him under the chin , his eyes had a vacant , trance - like stare , and drops of perspiration as big as peas were seen hailing down the dirt , bruises , and scratches of his white face . Then they stopped suddenly . Sotillo looked at him in silence . "
159012	159378	159003	159003	you	4351	" he asked . Already a rope , whose one end was fastened to Senor Hirsch 's wrists , had been thrown over a beam , and three soldiers held the other end , waiting . He made no answer . His heavy lower lip hung stupidly . Sotillo made a sign . Hirsch was jerked up off his feet , and a yell of despair and agony burst out in the room , filled the passage of the great buildings , rent the air outside , caused every soldier of the camp along the shore to look up at the windows , started some of the officers in the hall babbling excitedly , with shining eyes ; others , setting their lips , looked gloomily at the floor . Sotillo , followed by the soldiers , had left the room . The sentry on the landing presented arms . Hirsch went on screaming all alone behind the half - closed jalousies while the sunshine , reflected from the water of the harbour , made an ever - running ripple of light high up on the wall . He screamed with uplifted eyebrows and a wide - open mouth - incredibly wide , black , enormous , full of teeth - comical . In the still burning air of the windless afternoon he made the waves of his agony travel as far as the O. S. N. Company 's offices . Captain Mitchell on the balcony , trying to make out what went on generally , had heard him faintly but distinctly , and the feeble and appalling sound lingered in his ears after he had retreated indoors with blanched cheeks . He had been driven off the balcony several times during that afternoon . Sotillo , irritable , moody , walked restlessly about , held consultations with his officers , gave contradictory orders in this shrill clamour pervading the whole empty edifice . Sometimes there would be long and awful silences . Several times he had entered the torture - chamber where his sword , horsewhip , revolver , and field - glass were lying on the table , to ask with forced calmness , "
159392	159503	159388	159388	I	0	" But he could not afford to wait much longer . That was just it . Every time he went in and came out with a slam of the door , the sentry on the landing presented arms , and got in return a black , venomous , unsteady glance , which , in reality , saw nothing at all , being merely the reflection of the soul within - a soul of gloomy hatred , irresolution , avarice , and fury . The sun had set when he went in once more . A soldier carried in two lighted candles and slunk out , shutting the door without noise . "
159537	159606	159609	159613	thief - scoundrel - picaro	4357	" A slight quiver passed up the taut rope from the racked limbs , but the body of Senor Hirsch , enterprising business man from Esmeralda , hung under the heavy beam perpendicular and silent , facing the colonel awfully . The inflow of the night air , cooled by the snows of the Sierra , spread gradually a delicious freshness through the close heat of the room . "
159617	160119	159609	159613	thief - scoundrel - picaro	4357	" Sotillo had seized the riding - whip , and stood with his arm lifted up . For a word , for one little word , he felt he would have knelt , cringed , grovelled on the floor before the drowsy , conscious stare of those fixed eyeballs starting out of the grimy , dishevelled head that drooped very still with its mouth closed askew . The colonel ground his teeth with rage and struck . The rope vibrated leisurely to the blow , like the long string of a pendulum starting from a rest . But no swinging motion was imparted to the body of Senor Hirsch , the well - known hide merchant on the coast . With a convulsive effort of the twisted arms it leaped up a few inches , curling upon itself like a fish on the end of a line . Senor Hirsch 's head was flung back on his straining throat ; his chin trembled . For a moment the rattle of his chattering teeth pervaded the vast , shadowy room , where the candles made a patch of light round the two flames burning side by side . And as Sotillo , staying his raised hand , waited for him to speak , with the sudden flash of a grin and a straining forward of the wrenched shoulders , he spat violently into his face . The uplifted whip fell , and the colonel sprang back with a low cry of dismay , as if aspersed by a jet of deadly venom . Quick as thought he snatched up his revolver , and fired twice . The report and the concussion of the shots seemed to throw him at once from ungovernable rage into idiotic stupor . He stood with drooping jaw and stony eyes . What had he done , Sangre de Dios ! What had he done ? He was basely appalled at his impulsive act , sealing for ever these lips from which so much was to be extorted . What could he say ? How could he explain ? Ideas of headlong flight somewhere , anywhere , passed through his mind ; even the craven and absurd notion of hiding under the table occurred to his cowardice . It was too late ; his officers had rushed in tumultuously , in a great clatter of scabbards , clamouring , with astonishment and wonder . But since they did not immediately proceed to plunge their swords into his breast , the brazen side of his character asserted itself . Passing the sleeve of his uniform over his face he pulled himself together , His truculent glance turned slowly here and there , checked the noise where it fell ; and the stiff body of the late Senor Hirsch , merchant , after swaying imperceptibly , made a half turn , and came to a rest in the midst of awed murmurs and uneasy shuffling . A voice remarked loudly , "
160129	160147	160121	160127	a man who will never speak again	4358	" And another , from the back row of faces , timid and pressing , cried out - "
160157	160158	160150	160150	you	4359	" "
160165	160518	160160	160160	he	4358	" answered Sotillo , with the hardihood of desperation . He felt himself cornered . He brazened it out on the strength of his reputation with very fair success . His hearers thought him very capable of such an act . They were disposed to believe his flattering tale . There is no credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness , which , in its universal extent , measures the moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind . Ah ! he had confessed everything , this fractious Jew , this bribon . Good ! Then he was no longer wanted . A sudden dense guffaw was heard from the senior captain - a big - headed man , with little round eyes and monstrously fat cheeks which never moved . The old major , tall and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow , walked round the body of the late Senor Hirsch , muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like this there was no need to guard against any future treacheries of that scoundrel . The others stared , shifting from foot to foot , and whispering short remarks to each other . Sotillo buckled on his sword and gave curt , peremptory orders to hasten the retirement decided upon in the afternoon . Sinister , impressive , his sombrero pulled right down upon his eyebrows , he marched first through the door in such disorder of mind that he forgot utterly to provide for Dr. Monygham 's possible return . As the officers trooped out after him , one or two looked back hastily at the late Senor Hirsch , merchant from Esmeralda , left swinging rigidly at rest , alone with the two burning candles . In the emptiness of the room the burly shadow of head and shoulders on the wall had an air of life . Below , the troops fell in silently and moved off by companies without drum or trumpet . The old scarecrow major commanded the rearguard ; but the party he left behind with orders to fire the Custom House and "
160529	160654	160160	160160	he	4358	" failed somehow in their haste to set the staircase properly alight . The body of the late Senor Hirsch dwelt alone for a time in the dismal solitude of the unfinished building , resounding weirdly with sudden slams and clicks of doors and latches , with rustling scurries of torn papers , and the tremulous sighs that at each gust of wind passed under the high roof . The light of the two candles burning before the perpendicular and breathless immobility of the late Senor Hirsch threw a gleam afar over land and water , like a signal in the night . He remained to startle Nostromo by his presence , and to puzzle Dr. Monygham by the mystery of his atrocious end . "
160659	160680	160681	160681	You	4361	" the doctor again asked himself , audibly . This time he was answered by a dry laugh from Nostromo . "
160760	160761	160753	160753	you	4361	" "
160769	160774	160775	160775	I	0	" the doctor protested . "
160778	160779	160775	160775	I	0	" "
160794	160795	160792	160792	himself	772	" "
160805	160811	160800	160800	I	0	" caught up the doctor . "
160834	160931	160830	160832	a dangerous man	4324	" Their voices , which without rising had been growing quarrelsome , ceased suddenly . The late Senor Hirsch , erect and shadowy against the stars , seemed to be waiting attentive , in impartial silence . But Dr. Monygham had no mind to quarrel with Nostromo . At this supremely critical point of Sulaco 's fortunes it was borne upon him at last that this man was really indispensable , more indispensable than ever the infatuation of Captain Mitchell , his proud discoverer , could conceive ; far beyond what Decoud 's best dry raillery about "
160942	160955	160932	160934	my illustrious friend	4366	" had ever intended . The fellow was unique . He was not "
160961	161118	160932	160934	my illustrious friend	4366	" He was absolutely the only one . The doctor surrendered . There was something in the genius of that Genoese seaman which dominated the destinies of great enterprises and of many people , the fortunes of Charles Gould , the fate of an admirable woman . At this last thought the doctor had to clear his throat before he could speak . In a completely changed tone he pointed out to the Capataz that , to begin with , he personally ran no great risk . As far as everybody knew he was dead . It was an enormous advantage . He had only to keep out of sight in the Casa Viola , where the old Garibaldino was known to be alone - with his dead wife . The servants had all run away . No one would think of searching for him there , or anywhere else on earth , for that matter . "
161125	161132	160932	160934	my illustrious friend	4366	" Nostromo spoke up , bitterly , "
161140	161149	161138	161138	you	4367	" For a time the doctor kept silent . "
161164	161172	161158	161158	I	0	" he asked in an unsteady voice . "
161181	161182	161177	161177	I	0	" "
161237	161380	161226	161226	he	442	" The doctor swallowed with difficulty . His throat had gone dry in a moment . It was not from indignation . The doctor , pathetically enough , believed that he had forfeited the right to be indignant with any one - for anything . It was simple dread . Had the fellow heard his story by some chance ? If so , there was an end of his usefulness in that direction . The indispensable man escaped his influence , because of that indelible blot which made him fit for dirty work . A feeling as of sickness came upon the doctor . He would have given anything to know , but he dared not clear up the point . The fanaticism of his devotion , fed on the sense of his abasement , hardened his heart in sadness and scorn . "
161386	161392	161226	161226	he	442	" he reechoed , sardonically . "
161425	161426	161413	161413	you	4368	" "
161430	161437	161427	161428	Por Dios	350	" said the Capataz , passionately . "
161458	161459	161460	161460	You	4368	" "
161465	161472	161473	161473	I	0	" began the doctor , slowly . "
161478	161504	161475	161475	you	4368	" cried the other with a violent movement , as shadowy to the doctor 's eyes as the persistent immobility of the late Senor Hirsch . "
161569	161578	161567	161567	Caramba	356	" But he relented with a contemptuous fairness . "
161582	161589	161567	161567	Caramba	356	" he went on , quietly , "
161622	161629	161647	161647	Capataz	269	" He swung his arm downwards . "
161635	161644	161647	161647	Capataz	269	" he repeated . The doctor breathed freely . "
161649	161664	161665	161665	I	0	" he said , stretching out his arm almost affectionately towards Nostromo 's shoulder . "
161700	161836	161696	161696	I	0	" In the dark Nostromo bit his lip . He had heard enough of that . He knew what that meant . No more of that for him . But he had to look after himself now , he thought . And he thought , too , that it would not be prudent to part in anger from his companion . The doctor , admitted to be a great healer , had , amongst the populace of Sulaco , the reputation of being an evil sort of man . It was based solidly on his personal appearance , which was strange , and on his rough ironic manner - proofs visible , sensible , and incontrovertible of the doctor 's malevolent disposition . And Nostromo was of the people . So he only grunted incredulously . "
161848	161853	161696	161696	I	0	" the doctor pursued . "
161876	161877	161880	161880	senor	1479	" "
161882	161888	161880	161880	senor	1479	" said Nostromo , sullenly . "
161919	161920	161916	161916	I	0	" "
161926	161931	161932	161932	You	4375	" was the answer . "
161940	162180	161936	161936	yourself	4375	" muttered Nostromo , in a gloomy , threatening tone . But Dr. Monygham , full of hope , disregarded the enigmatic words and the threatening tone . To their eyes , accustomed to obscurity , the late Senor Hirsch , growing more distinct , seemed to have come nearer . And the doctor lowered his voice in exposing his scheme as though afraid of being overheard . He was taking the indispensable man into his fullest confidence . Its implied flattery and suggestion of great risks came with a familiar sound to the Capataz . His mind , floating in irresolution and discontent , recognized it with bitterness . He understood well that the doctor was anxious to save the San Tome mine from annihilation . He would be nothing without it . It was his interest . Just as it had been the interest of Senor Decoud , of the Blancos , and of the Europeans to get his Cargadores on their side . His thought became arrested upon Decoud . What would happen to him ? Nostromo 's prolonged silence made the doctor uneasy . He pointed out , quite unnecessarily , that though for the present he was safe , he could not live concealed for ever . The choice was between accepting the mission to Barrios , with all its dangers and difficulties , and leaving Sulaco by stealth , ingloriously , in poverty . "
162202	162203	162200	162200	himself	298	" "
162258	162275	162249	162249	You	4383	" It was the doctor 's turn to remain silent in the contemplation of horrible contingencies . "
162299	162300	162288	162288	you	4383	" "
162338	162339	162334	162335	Don Jose	247	" "
162345	162352	162340	162340	I	0	" burst out the exasperated doctor . "
162436	162437	162425	162425	Decoud	404	" "
162450	162455	162441	162441	you	4383	" muttered the other . "
162478	162479	162506	162508	a devoted Ribierist	4391	" "
162491	162499	162484	162484	you	4383	" Nostromo said in an incredulous tone . "
162510	162555	162503	162503	I	0	" repeated Dr. Monygham , grimly . Again Nostromo , gazing abstractedly at the body of the late Senor Hirsch , remained silent , thinking that the doctor was a dangerous person in more than one sense . It was impossible to trust him . "
162566	162572	162557	162557	you	4383	" he asked at last . "
162578	162588	162575	162575	I	0	" the doctor said , loudly , without hesitation . "
162598	162611	162595	162595	He	298	" he added in a mutter , which Nostromo did not catch . "
162619	162624	162614	162614	you	4383	" The doctor started . "
162647	162648	162651	162651	myself	0	" "
162653	162657	162651	162651	myself	0	" repeated Nostromo . "
162683	162684	162671	162671	I	0	" "
162694	162719	162691	162691	you	4383	" the doctor said , with a roughness of tone intended to hide the sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice . "
162747	162765	162734	162738	Some of Sotillo 's men	4394	" He slipped off the table , listening intently . The Capataz , too , stood up . "
162778	162782	162774	162774	you	4383	" he asked . "
162801	162802	162796	162796	I	0	" "
162898	162899	162892	162892	you	4383	" "
162915	162922	162908	162908	I	0	" the doctor said , hastily . "
162928	162929	162908	162908	I	0	" "
162940	162941	162936	162936	I	0	" "
162950	162974	162946	162946	You	0	" They moved a few paces towards the door . Behind them the late Senor Hirsch preserved the immobility of a disregarded man . "
162990	163000	162981	162981	I	0	" pursued the doctor , in a low tone . "
163008	163145	163006	163006	Sotillo	442	" And Dr. Monygham stopped short in the doorway as if intimidated by the difficulty . He had made the sacrifice of his life . He considered this a fitting opportunity . But he did not want to throw his life away too soon . In his quality of betrayer of Don Carlos ' confidence , he would have ultimately to indicate the hiding - place of the treasure . That would be the end of his deception , and the end of himself as well , at the hands of the infuriated colonel . He wanted to delay him to the very last moment ; and he had been racking his brains to invent some place of concealment at once plausible and difficult of access . He imparted his trouble to Nostromo , and concluded - "
163189	163218	163277	163277	you	4406	" A low exclamation had escaped Nostromo . The doctor waited , surprised , and after a moment of profound silence , heard a thick voice stammer out , "
163222	163229	163277	163277	you	4406	" and stop with a gasp . "
163233	163234	163277	163277	you	4406	" "
163243	163256	163237	163237	You	4406	" began Nostromo , scathingly , gathering scorn as he went on . "
163398	163420	163395	163395	I	0	" He shook his fists above his head . The doctor was overwhelmed at first by this fierce , hissing vehemence . "
163444	163450	163428	163428	your	4406	" he said , sullenly . "
163467	163480	163481	163481	I	0	" Nostromo had calmed down as quickly as he had flared up . "
163488	163498	163481	163481	I	0	" he said , quietly , almost with indifference . "
163536	163537	163588	163588	You	4406	" "
163543	163549	163588	163588	You	4406	" the doctor put in . "
163561	163562	163588	163588	You	4406	" "
163572	163579	163580	163580	He	442	" the doctor said , contemptuously . "
163586	163587	163588	163588	You	4406	" "
163729	163730	163721	163721	his	442	" "
163739	163744	163745	163745	Si	432	" muttered the doctor . "
163815	163816	163813	163813	He	442	" "
163825	163834	163813	163813	He	442	" the doctor repeated in an excited whisper . "
163851	163879	163844	163849	a great genius in your way	4428	" Nostromo had paused ; then began again in a changed tone , sombre , speaking to himself as though he had forgotten the doctor 's existence . "
164003	164004	164005	164005	You	8741	" "
164022	164028	164013	164013	Capataz	251	" Nostromo pressed his arm . "
164093	164136	164137	164137	You	8741	" He laughed wildly and turned in the doorway towards the body of the late Senor Hirsch , an opaque long blotch in the semi - transparent obscurity of the room between the two tall parallelograms of the windows full of stars . "
164142	164146	164137	164137	You	8741	" he cried . "
164188	164402	164179	164179	I	0	" He bounded downwards into the black , smoky hall . With a grunt of astonishment , Dr. Monygham threw himself recklessly into the pursuit . At the bottom of the charred stairs he had a fall , pitching forward on his face with a force that would have stunned a spirit less intent upon a task of love and devotion . He was up in a moment , jarred , shaken , with a queer impression of the terrestrial globe having been flung at his head in the dark . But it wanted more than that to stop Dr. Monygham 's body , possessed by the exaltation of self - sacrifice ; a reasonable exaltation , determined not to lose whatever advantage chance put into its way . He ran with headlong , tottering swiftness , his arms going like a windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippled feet . He lost his hat ; the tails of his open gaberdine flew behind him . He had no mind to lose sight of the indispensable man . But it was a long time , and a long way from the Custom House , before he managed to seize his arm from behind , roughly , out of breath . "
164409	164432	164406	164406	you	4441	" Already Nostromo was walking slowly , his head dropping , as if checked in his pace by the weariness of irresolution . "
164454	164455	164451	164452	Siempre Nostromo	487	" "
164466	164471	164458	164458	you	4441	" panted the doctor . "
164511	164538	164539	164540	The priests	6242	" Under the starry sky the Albergo d'ltalia Una emerged , black and low , breaking the dark level of the plain . Nostromo stopped altogether . "
164551	164560	164548	164548	they	6242	" he added , through his clenched teeth . "
164610	164614	164605	164605	You	4447	" He waited . "
164617	164618	164605	164605	You	4447	" "
164625	164626	164620	164620	I	0	" "
164637	164644	164645	164645	I	0	" exclaimed the doctor in agitation . "
164664	164665	164666	164666	I	0	" "
164669	164670	164671	164671	You	4447	" "
164675	164704	164705	164705	I	0	" hissed the doctor , fiercely , almost beside himself with the fear of the man doing away with his usefulness for an imbecile whim of some sort . "
164717	164745	164712	164712	I	0	" He stopped at loss for words , feeling fagged out , powerless , holding on to Nostromo 's sleeve , absolutely for support after his run . "
164750	164774	164712	164712	I	0	" muttered the Capataz to himself ; and the doctor , who overheard the last word , made an effort to speak calmly . "
164789	164838	164839	164839	Reflect	488	" He thought with a sickening dread that the man was so well known that he could not escape recognition . The house of the Senor Administrador was beset by spies , no doubt . And even the very servants of the casa were not to be trusted . "
164843	164852	164839	164839	Reflect	488	" he said , impressively . . . . "
164859	164860	164855	164855	you	4453	" "
164923	164924	164918	164918	you	4453	" "
164935	164942	164925	164925	You	4453	" said Dr. Monygham , dismally . "
164983	164984	164985	164985	My	0	" "
164989	164993	164985	164985	My	0	" muttered Nostromo . "
164998	164999	165000	165000	I	0	" "
165022	165041	165006	165006	you	4453	" the doctor said in a grim tone , which showed that he was recovering from his exertions . "
165113	165133	165134	165134	Maladetta	489	" Turning swiftly , and catching the doctor by the shoulders , Nostromo thrust his face close to his . "
165179	165180	165167	165167	Sidoni	490	" "
165196	165225	165186	165186	I	0	" the doctor said , stoically . He felt on his shoulders the weight of these hands famed amongst the populace for snapping thick ropes and bending horseshoes . "
165285	165370	165283	165283	hombre	4472	" Nostromo released him abruptly , and the doctor feared that the indispensable man would run off again . But he did not . He walked on slowly . The doctor hobbled by his side till , within a stone 's throw from the Casa Viola , Nostromo stopped again . Silent in inhospitable darkness , the Casa Viola seemed to have changed its nature ; his home appeared to repel him with an air of hopeless and inimical mystery . The doctor said - "
165382	165383	165380	165380	Capataz	251	" "
165390	165403	165404	165404	She	4474	" Nostromo seemed to ask himself in a low , inward tone . "
165422	165423	165424	165424	I	0	" "
165499	165922	165923	165923	Giorgio	252	" Dr. Monygham , disregarding , or perhaps fearing to penetrate the meaning of Nostromo 's silence , clapped him lightly on the shoulder , and starting off with his smart , lame walk , vanished utterly at the third or fourth hop in the direction of the railway track . Arrested between the two wooden posts for people to fasten their horses to , Nostromo did not move , as if he , too , had been planted solidly in the ground . At the end of half an hour he lifted his head to the deep baying of the dogs at the railway yards , which had burst out suddenly , tumultuous and deadened as if coming from under the plain . That lame doctor with the evil eye had got there pretty fast . Step by step Nostromo approached the Albergo d'Italia Una , which he had never known so lightless , so silent , before . The door , all black in the pale wall , stood open as he had left it twenty - four hours before , when he had nothing to hide from the world . He remained before it , irresolute , like a fugitive , like a man betrayed . Poverty , misery , starvation ! Where had he heard these words ? The anger of a dying woman had prophesied that fate for his folly . It looked as if it would come true very quickly . And the leperos would laugh - she had said . Yes , they would laugh if they knew that the Capataz de Cargadores was at the mercy of the mad doctor whom they could remember , only a few years ago , buying cooked food from a stall on the Plaza for a copper coin - like one of themselves . At that moment the notion of seeking Captain Mitchell passed through his mind . He glanced in the direction of the jetty and saw a small gleam of light in the O.S.N. Company 's building . The thought of lighted windows was not attractive . Two lighted windows had decoyed him into the empty Custom House , only to fall into the clutches of that doctor . No ! He would not go near lighted windows again on that night . Captain Mitchell was there . And what could he be told ? That doctor would worm it all out of him as if he were a child . On the threshold he called out "
165925	165937	165923	165923	Giorgio	252	" in an undertone . Nobody answered . He stepped in . "
165949	165985	165943	165943	you	252	" In the impenetrable darkness his head swam with the illusion that the obscurity of the kitchen was as vast as the Placid Gulf , and that the floor dipped forward like a sinking lighter . "
165990	166205	165943	165943	you	252	" he repeated , falteringly , swaying where he stood . His hand , extended to steady himself , fell upon the table . Moving a step forward , he shifted it , and felt a box of matches under his fingers . He fancied he had heard a quiet sigh . He listened for a moment , holding his breath ; then , with trembling hands , tried to strike a light . The tiny piece of wood flamed up quite blindingly at the end of his fingers , raised above his blinking eyes . A concentrated glare fell upon the leonine white head of old Giorgio against the black fire - place - showed him leaning forward in a chair in staring immobility , surrounded , overhung , by great masses of shadow , his legs crossed , his cheek in his hand , an empty pipe in the corner of his mouth . It seemed hours before he attempted to turn his face ; at the very moment the match went out , and he disappeared , overwhelmed by the shadows , as if the walls and roof of the desolate house had collapsed upon his white head in ghostly silence . Nostromo heard him stir and utter dispassionately the words - "
166213	166214	165943	165943	you	252	" "
166217	166223	165943	165943	you	252	" he said , softly . "
166232	166242	166229	166230	old man	4479	" A strong chest voice asked in the dark - "
166253	166254	166245	166245	you	4479	" "
166265	166952	166955	166955	viejo	8473	" After his release by Sotillo , Giorgio Viola , attended to the very door by the good - natured engineer - in - chief , had reentered his house , which he had been made to leave almost at the very moment of his wife 's death . All was still . The lamp above was burning . He nearly called out to her by name ; and the thought that no call from him would ever again evoke the answer of her voice , made him drop heavily into the chair with a loud groan , wrung out by the pain as of a keen blade piercing his breast . The rest of the night he made no sound . The darkness turned to grey , and on the colourless , clear , glassy dawn the jagged sierra stood out flat and opaque , as if cut out of paper . The enthusiastic and severe soul of Giorgio Viola , sailor , champion of oppressed humanity , enemy of kings , and , by the grace of Mrs. Gould , hotel - keeper of the Sulaco harbour , had descended into the open abyss of desolation amongst the shattered vestiges of his past . He remembered his wooing between two campaigns , a single short week in the season of gathering olives . Nothing approached the grave passion of that time but the deep , passionate sense of his bereavement . He discovered all the extent of his dependence upon the silenced voice of that woman . It was her voice that he missed . Abstracted , busy , lost in inward contemplation , he seldom looked at his wife in those later years . The thought of his girls was a matter of concern , not of consolation . It was her voice that he would miss . And he remembered the other child - the little boy who died at sea . Ah ! a man would have been something to lean upon . And , alas ! even Gian ' Battista - he of whom , and of Linda , his wife had spoken to him so anxiously before she dropped off into her last sleep on earth , he on whom she had called aloud to save the children , just before she died - even he was dead ! And the old man , bent forward , his head in his hand , sat through the day in immobility and solitude . He never heard the brazen roar of the bells in town . When it ceased the earthenware filter in the corner of the kitchen kept on its swift musical drip , drip into the great porous jar below . Towards sunset he got up , and with slow movements disappeared up the narrow staircase . His bulk filled it ; and the rubbing of his shoulders made a small noise as of a mouse running behind the plaster of a wall . While he remained up there the house was as dumb as a grave . Then , with the same faint rubbing noise , he descended . He had to catch at the chairs and tables to regain his seat . He seized his pipe off the high mantel of the fire - place - but made no attempt to reach the tobacco - thrust it empty into the corner of his mouth , and sat down again in the same staring pose . The sun of Pedrito 's entry into Sulaco , the last sun of Senor Hirsch 's life , the first of Decoud 's solitude on the Great Isabel , passed over the Albergo d'ltalia Una on its way to the west . The tinkling drip , drip of the filter had ceased , the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out , and the night beset Giorgio Viola and his dead wife with its obscurity and silence that seemed invincible till the Capataz de Cargadores , returning from the dead , put them to flight with the splutter and flare of a match . "
166963	167079	166959	166959	me	0	" Nostromo , after barricading the door and closing the shutters carefully , groped upon a shelf for a candle , and lit it . Old Viola had risen . He followed with his eyes in the dark the sounds made by Nostromo . The light disclosed him standing without support , as if the mere presence of that man who was loyal , brave , incorruptible , who was all his son would have been , were enough for the support of his decaying strength . He extended his hand grasping the briar - wood pipe , whose bowl was charred on the edge , and knitted his bushy eyebrows heavily at the light . "
167084	167092	167080	167080	You	0	" he said , with shaky dignity . "
167101	167126	167098	167098	I	0	" He broke off . Nostromo , leaning back against the table , his arms folded on his breast , nodded at him slightly . "
167164	167299	167300	167300	She	4486	" The Garibaldino , motionless , seemed to drink in the sound of the well - known voice . His head moved slightly once as if in sign of approval ; but Nostromo saw clearly that the old man understood nothing of the words . There was no one to understand ; no one he could take into the confidence of Decoud 's fate , of his own , into the secret of the silver . That doctor was an enemy of the people - a tempter . . . . Old Giorgio 's heavy frame shook from head to foot with the effort to overcome his emotion at the sight of that man , who had shared the intimacies of his domestic life as though he had been a grown - up son . "
167306	167317	167318	167318	She	4486	" he said , solemnly . Nostromo raised his head . "
167334	167341	167343	167343	she	4486	" He finished the thought mentally : "
167358	167493	167343	167343	she	4486	" These words of Teresa 's anger , from the circumstances in which they had been uttered , like the cry of a soul prevented from making its peace with God , stirred the obscure superstition of personal fortune from which even the greatest genius amongst men of adventure and action is seldom free . They reigned over Nostromo 's mind with the force of a potent malediction . And what a curse it was that which her words had laid upon him ! He had been orphaned so young that he could remember no other woman whom he called mother . Henceforth there would be no enterprise in which he would not fail . The spell was working already . Death itself would elude him now . . . . He said violently - "
167521	167731	167755	167755	she	4490	" With his chin dropped again upon his bare breast above his folded arms , barefooted , watching from under a gloomy brow the movements of old Viola foraging amongst the cupboards , he seemed as if indeed fallen under a curse - a ruined and sinister Capataz . Old Viola walked out of a dark corner , and , without a word , emptied upon the table out of his hollowed palms a few dry crusts of bread and half a raw onion . While the Capataz began to devour this beggar 's fare , taking up with stony - eyed voracity piece after piece lying by his side , the Garibaldino went off , and squatting down in another corner filled an earthenware mug with red wine out of a wicker - covered demijohn . With a familiar gesture , as when serving customers in the cafe , he had thrust his pipe between his teeth to have his hands free . The Capataz drank greedily . A slight flush deepened the bronze of his cheek . Before him , Viola , with a turn of his white and massive head towards the staircase , took his empty pipe out of his mouth , and pronounced slowly - "
167771	167777	167755	167755	she	4490	" The Capataz looked up . "
167815	167816	167809	167809	Thy	4496	" "
167821	167826	167817	167817	I	0	" muttered Giorgio Viola . "
167890	167891	167893	167893	she	6205	" "
167943	167944	167945	167945	You	0	" "
167950	167959	167945	167945	You	0	" said old Viola in a strong voice . "
167973	167974	167960	167960	You	0	" "
168034	168035	168036	168036	She	6205	" "
168041	168081	168036	168036	She	6205	" The heroic follower of Garibaldi , at the thought of the eternal stillness and silence fallen upon the shrouded form stretched out on the bed upstairs , averted his face and raised his hand to his furrowed brow . "
168092	168253	168086	168086	I	0	" he stammered out , pitifully . Before the wide eyes of the Capataz , staring at the doorway of the dark staircase , floated the shape of the Great Isabel , like a strange ship in distress , freighted with enormous wealth and the solitary life of a man . It was impossible for him to do anything . He could only hold his tongue , since there was no one to trust . The treasure would be lost , probably - unless Decoud . . . . And his thought came abruptly to an end . He perceived that he could not imagine in the least what Decoud was likely to do . Old Viola had not stirred . And the motionless Capataz dropped his long , soft eyelashes , which gave to the upper part of his fierce , black - whiskered face a touch of feminine ingenuousness . The silence had lasted for a long time . "
168259	168308	168310	168310	my	0	" he murmured , gloomily . CHAPTER TEN The next day was quiet in the morning , except for the faint sound of firing to the northward , in the direction of Los Hatos . Captain Mitchell had listened to it from his balcony anxiously . The phrase , "
168335	168348	168325	168325	sir	5644	" had its place in the more or less stereotyped relation of the "
168351	168387	168466	168466	Nostromo	251	" which for the next few years was at the service of distinguished strangers visiting Sulaco . The mention of the dignity and neutrality of the flag , so difficult to preserve in his position , "
168420	168459	168460	168464	that poor fellow of mine	1791	" came next in order . Captain Mitchell was not the man to enlarge upon mere dangers much . But he insisted that it was a memorable day . On that day , towards dusk , he had seen "
168501	168625	168499	168499	sir	5644	" Regarded by the O. S. N. Company as an old and faithful servant , Captain Mitchell was allowed to attain the term of his usefulness in ease and dignity at the head of the enormously extended service . The augmentation of the establishment , with its crowds of clerks , an office in town , the old office in the harbour , the division into departments - passenger , cargo , lighterage , and so on - secured a greater leisure for his last years in the regenerated Sulaco , the capital of the Occidental Republic . Liked by the natives for his good nature and the formality of his manner , self - important and simple , known for years as a "
168631	168835	168499	168499	sir	5644	" he felt himself a personality of mark in the town . Getting up early for a turn in the market - place while the gigantic shadow of Higuerota was still lying upon the fruit and flower stalls piled up with masses of gorgeous colouring , attending easily to current affairs , welcomed in houses , greeted by ladies on the Alameda , with his entry into all the clubs and a footing in the Casa Gould , he led his privileged old bachelor , man - about - town existence with great comfort and solemnity . But on mail - boat days he was down at the Harbour Office at an early hour , with his own gig , manned by a smart crew in white and blue , ready to dash off and board the ship directly she showed her bows between the harbour heads . It would be into the Harbour Office that he would lead some privileged passenger he had brought off in his own boat , and invite him to take a seat for a moment while he signed a few papers . And Captain Mitchell , seating himself at his desk , would keep on talking hospitably - "
169026	169066	169017	169017	I	0	" Proud of his experience , penetrated by the sense of historical importance of men , events , and buildings , he talked pompously in jerky periods , with slight sweeps of his short , thick arm , letting nothing "
169070	169076	168990	168990	Parrochetti	493	" of his privileged captive . "
169474	169492	169468	169468	They	4581	" And all day Captain Mitchell would talk like this to his more or less willing victim - "
169508	169525	169496	169496	I	0	" From the very centre , in the blazing sunshine , he pointed out the buildings - "
169942	170016	169930	169930	he	298	" Thus Captain Mitchell would talk in the middle of the Plaza , holding over his head a white umbrella with a green lining ; but inside the cathedral , in the dim light , with a faint scent of incense floating in the cool atmosphere , and here and there a kneeling female figure , black or all white , with a veiled head , his lowered voice became solemn and impressive . "
170019	170036	169930	169930	he	298	" he would say , pointing to a niche in the wall of the dusky aisle , "
170335	170364	170365	170365	Porvenir	398	" Directly outside the cathedral on the very top of the noble flight of steps , his voice rose pompously , his arm found again its sweeping gesture . "
170569	170694	170553	170563	the bishop at the foot of the stairs to the right	4673	" And the lunch would begin and terminate its lavish and leisurely course at a little table in the gallery , Captain Mitchell nodding , bowing , getting up to speak for a moment to different officials in black clothes , merchants in jackets , officers in uniform , middle - aged caballeros from the Campo - sallow , little , nervous men , and fat , placid , swarthy men , and Europeans or North Americans of superior standing , whose faces looked very white amongst the majority of dark complexions and black , glistening eyes . Captain Mitchell would lie back in the chair , casting around looks of satisfaction , and tender over the table a case full of thick cigars . "
170873	170921	170865	170867	Tres de Mayo	498	" Captain Mitchell , with an expression as though making ready to hear a sermon in a church , would lift the tiny cup to his lips . And the nectar would be sipped to the bottom during a restful silence in a cloud of cigar smoke . "
170932	170941	170924	170930	this man in black just going out	4692	" he would begin , leaning forward hastily . "
170998	171117	171118	171128	The protector of the Sulaco refugees from the rage of Pedrito	4700	" Captain Mitchell 's guest , staring curiously , would see a figure in a long - tailed black coat walking gravely , with downcast eyelids in a long , composed face , a brow furrowed horizontally , a pointed head , whose grey hair , thin at the top , combed down carefully on all sides and rolled at the ends , fell low on the neck and shoulders . This , then , was the famous bandit of whom Europe had heard with interest . He put on a high - crowned sombrero with a wide flat brim ; a rosary of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist . And Captain Mitchell would proceed - "
171198	171219	171178	171178	he	349	" He took several puffs at his cigar in silence ; then , in his most important manner , pronounced : "
171299	171326	171365	171367	Always white mules	4719	" The programme went on relentless , like a law of Nature . The turn on the Alameda was taken with slow steps and stately remarks . "
171337	171354	171355	171356	Dona Emilia	307	" Captain Mitchell bowed right and left with no end of formality ; then with animation , "
171408	171468	171469	171473	A familiar of the house	4725	" He took off his hat ; then , with a studied change of tone , added , negligently , that the man in black by her side , with a high white collar and a scarred , snarly face , was Dr. Monygham , Inspector of State Hospitals , chief medical officer of the Consolidated San Tome mines . "
171587	171593	171566	171566	He	4725	" His arm went up . "
171615	171622	171662	171663	Cavaliere Parrochetti	493	" Captain Mitchell commented , obscurely . "
171721	171726	171708	171708	He	4725	" added Captain Mitchell , "
171742	171764	171765	171765	He	4725	" He dropped on to a stone seat under a tree , and tapped invitingly at the place by his side . "
172595	172797	172573	172573	his	442	" He was preparing to hang Dr. Monygham whom he had on board at the end of the after - derrick , when the first of Barrios 's transports , one of our own ships at that , steamed right in , and ranging close alongside opened a small - arm fire without as much preliminaries as a hail . It was the completest surprise in the world , sir . They were too astounded at first to bolt below . Men were falling right and left like ninepins . It 's a miracle that Monygham , standing on the after - hatch with the rope already round his neck , escaped being riddled through and through like a sieve . He told me since that he had given himself up for lost , and kept on yelling with all the strength of his lungs : ' Hoist a white flag ! Hoist a white flag ! ' Suddenly an old major of the Esmeralda regiment , standing by , unsheathed his sword with a shriek : ' Die , perjured traitor ! ' and ran Sotillo clean through the body , just before he fell himself shot through the head . "
172805	173351	173352	173352	He	4796	" Begad , sir ! I could spin you a yarn for hours . But it 's time we started off to Rincon . It would not do for you to pass through Sulaco and not see the lights of the San Tome mine , a whole mountain ablaze like a lighted palace above the dark Campo . It 's a fashionable drive . . . . But let me tell you one little anecdote , sir ; just to show you . A fortnight or more later , when Barrios , declared Generalissimo , was gone in pursuit of Pedrito away south , when the Provisional Junta , with Don Juste Lopez at its head , had promulgated the new Constitution , and our Don Carlos Gould was packing up his trunks bound on a mission to San Francisco and Washington the United States , sir , were the first great power to recognize the Occidental Republic - a fortnight later , I say , when we were beginning to feel that our heads were safe on our shoulders , if I may express myself so , a prominent man , a large shipper by our line , came to see me on business , and , says he , the first thing : ' I say , Captain Mitchell , is that fellow ' meaning Nostromo ' still the Capataz of your Cargadores or not ? ' ' What 's the matter ? ' says I. ' Because , if he is , then I do n't mind ; I send and receive a good lot of cargo by your ships ; but I have observed him several days loafing about the wharf , and just now he stopped me as cool as you please , with a request for a cigar . Now , you know , my cigars are rather special , and I ca n't get them so easily as all that . ' ' I hope you stretched a point , ' I said , very gently . ' Why , yes . But it 's a confounded nuisance . The fellow 's everlastingly cadging for smokes . ' Sir , I turned my eyes away , and then asked , ' Were n't you one of the prisoners in the Cabildo ? ' ' You know very well I was , and in chains , too , ' says he . ' And under a fine of fifteen thousand dollars ? ' He coloured , sir , because it got about that he fainted from fright when they came to arrest him , and then behaved before Fuentes in a manner to make the very policianos , who had dragged him there by the hair of his head , smile at his cringing . ' Yes , ' he says , in a sort of shy way . ' Why ? ' ' Oh , nothing . You stood to lose a tidy bit , ' says I , ' even if you saved your life . . . . But what can I do for you ? ' He never even saw the point . Not he . And that 's how the world wags , sir . "
173401	173419	173379	173379	his	4796	" A great power , this , for good and evil , sir . A great power . "
173486	173490	173471	173473	Anglo - Saxon	585	" taking a rise "
173568	173604	173607	173608	the superintendent	902	" Ten o'clock . Your ship wo n't be ready to leave till half - past twelve , if by then . Come in for a brandy - and - soda and one more cigar . "
173686	173691	173675	173675	him	902	" in this very harbour "
173786	173797	173779	173784	the brother of his then mistress	4818	" The abominable Pedrito , sir , fled the country , "
173808	173852	173779	173784	the brother of his then mistress	4818	" A captain of one of our ships told me lately that he recognized Pedrito the Guerrillero , arrayed in purple slippers and a velvet smoking - cap with a gold tassel , keeping a disorderly house in one of the southern ports . "
173853	173863	173890	173890	his	304	" Abominable Pedrito ! Who the devil was he ? "
173908	173923	173925	173926	Captain Mitchell	267	" He appeared to me in this very room like a haunting ghost , sir "
173944	174241	174247	174247	he	4820	" You may imagine , sir , what an effect it produced on me . He had come round by sea with Barrios , of course . And the first thing he told me after I became fit to hear him was that he had picked up the lighter 's boat floating in the gulf ! He seemed quite overcome by the circumstance . And a remarkable enough circumstance it was , when you remember that it was then sixteen days since the sinking of the silver . At once I could see he was another man . He stared at the wall , sir , as if there had been a spider or something running about there . The loss of the silver preyed on his mind . The first thing he asked me about was whether Dona Antonia had heard yet of Decoud 's death . His voice trembled . I had to tell him that Dona Antonia , as a matter of fact , was not back in town yet . Poor girl ! And just as I was making ready to ask him a thousand questions , with a sudden , ' Pardon me , senor , ' he cleared out of the office altogether . I did not see him again for three days . I was terribly busy , you know . It seems that he wandered about in and out of the town , and on two nights turned up to sleep in the baracoons of the railway people . He seemed absolutely indifferent to what went on . I asked him on the wharf , ' When are you going to take hold again , Nostromo ? There will be plenty of work for the Cargadores presently . ' "
174299	174357	174358	174358	he	4820	" I begged him not to think any more about the silver , and he smiled . A smile that went to my heart , sir . ' It was no mistake , ' I told him . ' It was a fatality . A thing that could not be helped . ' ' Si , si ! "
174481	174706	174475	174475	his	4820	" ' My name is known from one end of Sulaco to the other , ' he said , as quiet as the other . ' What more can you do for me ? ' That was all that passed on that occasion . Later , however , there was a very fine coasting schooner for sale , and Mrs. Gould and I put our heads together to get her bought and presented to him . It was done , but he paid all the price back within the next three years . Business was booming all along this seaboard , sir . Moreover , that man always succeeded in everything except in saving the silver . Poor Dona Antonia , fresh from her terrible experiences in the woods of Los Hatos , had an interview with him , too . Wanted to hear about Decoud : what they said , what they did , what they thought up to the last on that fatal night . Mrs. Gould told me his manner was perfect for quietness and sympathy . Miss Avellanos burst into tears only when he told her how Decoud had happened to say that his plan would be a glorious success . . . . And there 's no doubt , sir , that it is . It is a success . "
174736	174746	174747	174748	Captain Mitchell	267	" What on earth Decoud 's plan could be ? "
174752	174799	174747	174748	Captain Mitchell	267	" Sorry we must part so soon . Your intelligent interest made this a pleasant day to me . I shall see you now on board . You had a glimpse of the ' Treasure House of the World . ' A very good name that . "
175162	175166	175167	175167	Nostromo	251	" Mi General , "
175184	175207	175167	175167	Nostromo	251	" I should like to save that little boat . Por Dios , I know her . She belongs to my Company . "
175208	175214	175216	175216	Barrios	374	" And , por Dios , "
175227	175253	175216	175216	Barrios	374	" you belong to me . I am going to make you a captain of cavalry directly we get within sight of a horse again . "
175254	175268	175270	175270	Nostromo	251	" I can swim far better than I can ride , mi General , "
175285	175290	175282	175282	his	251	" Let me - - "
175291	175302	175304	175305	the General	5924	" Let you ? What a conceited fellow that is , "
175315	175358	175304	175305	the General	5924	" Let him go ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! He wants me to admit that we can not take Sulaco without him ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Would you like to swim off to her , my son ? "
175398	175406	175393	175394	The General	5924	" Cielo ! Sinner that I am ! "
175434	175458	175430	175430	he	5924	" No ! no ! We shall not stop to pick up this impertinent fellow . Let him drown - that mad Capataz . "
176429	176435	176436	176436	he	2385	" I know that thing , "
176449	176454	176436	176436	he	2385	" That 's blood . "
176922	176931	176932	176932	he	2385	" He might simply have cut his hand , "
176935	176941	176932	176932	he	2385	" But , then - - "
177030	177039	177024	177024	he	2385	" He will never come back to explain . "
177047	177050	177051	177051	he	2385	" Impossible ! "
177116	177126	177127	177127	he	2385	" But , then , I can not know , "
177368	177382	177347	177347	Decoud	257	" I have not seen as much as one single bird all day . "
177606	177610	177611	177616	the spoiled darling of the family	4931	" Son Decoud , "
178259	178272	178273	178273	he	504	" I wonder whether I would hear it snap before I fell , "
178726	178735	178738	178738	his	504	" Perhaps I may sleep to - night , "
178938	178943	178944	178944	he	504	" It is done , "
178960	178968	178955	178955	His	504	" I wonder how that Capataz died . "
179494	179497	179498	179498	he	257	" Ha ! "
179527	179544	179498	179498	he	257	" It is to her that he will fly . To her that he will fly ! "
179729	179737	179738	179738	he	2385	" I must grow rich very slowly , "
180251	180270	180240	180241	the doctor	6199	" I 'll leave you now to yourselves . I 'll call to - morrow if I may ? "
180271	180284	180290	180290	her	248	" Come to lunch , dear Dr. Monygham , and come early , "
180341	180351	180352	180353	Charles Gould	250	" Do n't expect to find me at home , "
180357	180367	180352	180353	Charles Gould	250	" I 'll be off early to the mine . "
180580	180586	180587	180587	she	248	" Do n't go yet , "
180673	180678	180712	180713	Mrs. Gould	248	" Never - tired Senora "
180697	180711	180712	180713	Mrs. Gould	248	" Do n't go yet . To - day is all my own , "
180718	180753	180712	180713	Mrs. Gould	248	" We are not back yet officially . No one will come . It 's only to - morrow that the windows of the Casa Gould are to be lit up for a reception . "
180761	180766	180767	180767	he	6199	" Giving a tertulia ? "
180775	180789	180767	180767	he	6199	" A simple greeting for all the kind friends who care to come . "
180790	180797	180893	180894	Mrs. Gould	248	" And only to - morrow ? "
180798	180846	180767	180767	he	6199	" Yes . Charles would be tired out after a day at the mine , and so I - - It would be good to have him to myself for one evening on our return to this house I love . It has seen all my life . "
180847	180852	180854	180855	the doctor	6199	" Ah , yes ! "
180859	180876	180854	180855	the doctor	6199	" Women count time from the marriage feast . Did n't you live a little before ? "
180877	180892	180893	180894	Mrs. Gould	248	" Yes ; but what is there to remember ? There were no cares . "
180950	180954	180957	180958	the doctor	6199	" And yet , "
180960	181069	180957	180958	the doctor	6199	" we who played our part in it had our reward . Don Pepe , though superannuated , still can sit a horse . Barrios is drinking himself to death in jovial company away somewhere on his fundacion beyond the Bolson de Tonoro . And the heroic Father Roman - I imagine the old padre blowing up systematically the San Tome mine , uttering a pious exclamation at every bang , and taking handfuls of snuff between the explosions - the heroic Padre Roman says that he is not afraid of the harm Holroyd 's missionaries can do to his flock , as long as he is alive . "
181092	181101	181070	181071	Mrs. Gould	248	" Ah , but you , dear friend ? "
181102	181112	180957	180958	the doctor	6199	" I did the work I was fit for . "
181113	181128	181070	181071	Mrs. Gould	248	" You faced the most cruel dangers of all . Something more than death . "
181129	181149	181070	181071	Mrs. Gould	248	" No , Mrs. Gould ! Only death - by hanging . And I am rewarded beyond my deserts . "
181164	181175	181177	181183	the Inspector - General of State Hospitals	5056	" I 've made my career - as you see , "
181287	181290	181291	181291	he	6199	" Yes , "
181295	181313	181291	181291	he	6199	" We all had our rewards - the engineer - in - chief , Captain Mitchell - - "
181314	181319	181325	181325	her	248	" We saw him , "
181329	181382	181325	181325	her	248	" The poor dear man came up from the country on purpose to call on us in our hotel in London . He comported himself with great dignity , but I fancy he regrets Sulaco . He rambled feebly about ' historical events ' till I felt I could have a cry . "
181383	181386	181388	181389	the doctor	6199	" H'm , "
181391	181425	181388	181389	the doctor	6199	" getting old , I suppose . Even Nostromo is getting older - though he is not changed . And , speaking of that fellow , I wanted to tell you something - - "
181694	181722	181687	181687	Antonia	256	" How can we abandon , groaning under oppression , those who have been our countrymen only a few years ago , who are our countrymen now ? "
181728	181753	181687	181687	Antonia	256	" How can we remain blind , and deaf without pity to the cruel wrongs suffered by our brothers ? There is a remedy . "
181754	181768	181770	181771	the doctor	6199	" Annex the rest of Costaguana to the order and prosperity of Sulaco , "
181773	181780	181770	181771	the doctor	6199	" There is no other remedy . "
181781	181789	181790	181790	Antonia	256	" I am convinced , senor doctor , "
181801	181813	181790	181790	Antonia	256	" that this was from the first poor Martin 's intention . "
181814	181837	181838	181839	the doctor	6199	" Yes , but the material interests will not let you jeopardize their development for a mere idea of pity and justice , "
181843	181852	181838	181839	the doctor	6199	" And it is just as well perhaps . "
181865	181884	181859	181859	his	5075	" We have worked for them ; we have made them , these material interests of the foreigners , "
181898	181906	181908	181909	the doctor	6199	" And without them you are nothing , "
181914	181921	181908	181909	the doctor	6199	" They will not let you . "
181922	181954	181955	181961	the popular Cardinal - Archbishop of Sulaco	5078	" Let them beware , then , lest the people , prevented from their aspirations , should rise and claim their share of the wealth and their share of the power , "
182106	182109	182094	182095	Dr. Monygham	249	" Incorrigible ! "
182136	182141	182143	182144	the doctor	6199	" Conspiring . Yes ! "
182146	182349	182143	182144	the doctor	6199	" The last of the Avellanos and the last of the Corbelans are conspiring with the refugees from Sta . Marta that flock here after every revolution . The Cafe Lambroso at the corner of the Plaza is full of them ; you can hear their chatter across the street like the noise of a parrot - house . They are conspiring for the invasion of Costaguana . And do you know where they go for strength , for the necessary force ? To the secret societies amongst immigrants and natives , where Nostromo - I should say Captain Fidanza - is the great man . What gives him that position ? Who can say ? Genius ? He has genius . He is greater with the populace than ever he was before . It is as if he had some secret power ; some mysterious means to keep up his influence . He holds conferences with the Archbishop , as in those old days which you and I remember . Barrios is useless . But for a military head they have the pious Hernandez . And they may raise the country with the new cry of the wealth for the people . "
182350	182364	182365	182366	Mrs. Gould	248	" Will there be never any peace ? Will there be no rest ? "
182369	182376	182365	182366	Mrs. Gould	248	" I thought that we - - "
182377	182380	182382	182383	the doctor	6199	" No ! "
182385	182476	182382	182383	the doctor	6199	" There is no peace and no rest in the development of material interests . They have their law , and their justice . But it is founded on expediency , and is inhuman ; it is without rectitude , without the continuity and the force that can be found only in a moral principle . Mrs. Gould , the time approaches when all that the Gould Concession stands for shall weigh as heavily upon the people as the barbarism , cruelty , and misrule of a few years back . "
182477	182487	182488	182488	she	248	" How can you say that , Dr. Monygham ? "
182504	182512	182513	182514	the doctor	6199	" I can say what is true , "
182519	182565	182513	182514	the doctor	6199	" It 'll weigh as heavily , and provoke resentment , bloodshed , and vengeance , because the men have grown different . Do you think that now the mine would march upon the town to save their Senor Administrador ? Do you think that ? "
182581	182592	182566	182566	She	248	" Is it this we have worked for , then ? "
182654	182808	182638	182639	the doctor	6199	" It is about Nostromo that I wanted to talk to you . Ah ! that fellow has some continuity and force . Nothing will put an end to him . But never mind that . There 's something inexplicable going on - or perhaps only too easy to explain . You know , Linda is practically the lighthouse keeper of the Great Isabel light . The Garibaldino is too old now . His part is to clean the lamps and to cook in the house ; but he ca n't get up the stairs any longer . The black - eyed Linda sleeps all day and watches the light all night . Not all day , though . She is up towards five in the afternoon , when our Nostromo , whenever he is in harbour with his schooner , comes out on his courting visit , pulling in a small boat . "
182809	182816	182817	182818	Mrs. Gould	248	" Are n't they married yet ? "
182821	182880	182817	182818	Mrs. Gould	248	" The mother wished it , as far as I can understand , while Linda was yet quite a child . When I had the girls with me for a year or so during the War of Separation , that extraordinary Linda used to declare quite simply that she was going to be Gian ' Battista 's wife . "
182881	182888	182890	182891	the doctor	6199	" They are not married yet , "
182895	182904	182890	182891	the doctor	6199	" I have looked after them a little . "
182905	182913	182915	182916	Mrs. Gould	248	" Thank you , dear Dr. Monygham , "
182940	182978	182979	182980	The doctor	6199	" People do n't know how really good you are . You will not let them know , as if on purpose to annoy me , who have put my faith in your good heart long ago . "
183077	183112	183113	183113	He	6199	" I am afraid of being overwhelmed by too much gratitude . However , these people interest me . I went out several times to the Great Isabel light to look after old Giorgio . "
183147	183153	183140	183141	old Giorgio	252	" English signora - the benefactress "
183168	183175	183159	183159	Linda	284	" our Dona Emilia - that angel "
183220	183259	183217	183217	himself	6199	" If I were n't what I am , old and ugly , I would think the minx is making eyes at me . And perhaps she is . I dare say she would make eyes at anybody . "
183283	183288	183281	183281	he	6199	" our great Nostromo . "
183289	183544	183281	183281	he	6199	" What I wanted to tell you is this : Our great Nostromo did not take much notice of the old man and the children for some years . It 's true , too , that he was away on his coasting voyages certainly ten months out of the twelve . He was making his fortune , as he told Captain Mitchell once . He seems to have done uncommonly well . It was only to be expected . He is a man full of resource , full of confidence in himself , ready to take chances and risks of every sort . I remember being in Mitchell 's office one day , when he came in with that calm , grave air he always carries everywhere . He had been away trading in the Gulf of California , he said , looking straight past us at the wall , as his manner is , and was glad to see on his return that a lighthouse was being built on the cliff of the Great Isabel . Very glad , he repeated . Mitchell explained that it was the O. S. N. Co. who was building it , for the convenience of the mail service , on his own advice . Captain Fidanza was good enough to say that it was excellent advice . I remember him twisting up his moustaches and looking all round the cornice of the room before he proposed that old Giorgio should be made the keeper of that light . "
183545	183558	183559	183560	Mrs. Gould	248	" I heard of this . I was consulted at the time , "
183563	183587	183559	183560	Mrs. Gould	248	" I doubted whether it would be good for these girls to be shut up on that island as if in a prison . "
183588	183674	183559	183560	Mrs. Gould	248	" The proposal fell in with the old Garibaldino 's humour . As to Linda , any place was lovely and delightful enough for her as long as it was Nostromo 's suggestion . She could wait for her Gian ' Battista 's good pleasure there as well as anywhere else . My opinion is that she was always in love with that incorruptible Capataz . Moreover , both father and sister were anxious to get Giselle away from the attentions of a certain Ramirez . "
183675	183678	183680	183681	Mrs. Gould	248	" Ah ! "
183685	183695	183680	183681	Mrs. Gould	248	" Ramirez ? What sort of man is that ? "
183696	183879	183887	183888	Mrs. Gould	248	" Just a mozo of the town . His father was a Cargador . As a lanky boy he ran about the wharf in rags , till Nostromo took him up and made a man of him . When he got a little older , he put him into a lighter and very soon gave him charge of the No . 3 boat - the boat which took the silver away , Mrs. Gould . Nostromo selected that lighter for the work because she was the best sailing and the strongest boat of all the Company 's fleet . Young Ramirez was one of the five Cargadores entrusted with the removal of the treasure from the Custom House on that famous night . As the boat he had charge of was sunk , Nostromo , on leaving the Company 's service , recommended him to Captain Mitchell for his successor . He had trained him in the routine of work perfectly , and thus Mr. Ramirez , from a starving waif , becomes a man and the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores . "
183880	183885	183887	183888	Mrs. Gould	248	" Thanks to Nostromo , "
183894	183899	183887	183888	Mrs. Gould	248	" Thanks to Nostromo , "
183904	184135	183901	183902	Dr. Monygham	249	" Upon my word , the fellow 's power frightens me when I think of it . That our poor old Mitchell was only too glad to appoint somebody trained to the work , who saved him trouble , is not surprising . What is wonderful is the fact that the Sulaco Cargadores accepted Ramirez for their chief , simply because such was Nostromo 's good pleasure . Of course , he is not a second Nostromo , as he fondly imagined he would be ; but still , the position was brilliant enough . It emboldened him to make up to Giselle Viola , who , you know , is the recognized beauty of the town . The old Garibaldino , however , took a violent dislike to him . I do n't know why . Perhaps because he was not a model of perfection like his Gian ' Battista , the incarnation of the courage , the fidelity , the honour of ' the people . ' Signor Viola does not think much of Sulaco natives . Both of them , the old Spartan and that white - faced Linda , with her red mouth and coal - black eyes , were looking rather fiercely after the fair one . Ramirez was warned off . Father Viola , I am told , threatened him with his gun once . "
184136	184143	184145	184146	Mrs. Gould	248	" But what of Giselle herself ? "
184148	184160	184162	184163	the doctor	6199	" She 's a bit of a flirt , I believe , "
184165	184350	184162	184163	the doctor	6199	" I do n't think she cared much one way or another . Of course she likes men 's attentions . Ramirez was not the only one , let me tell you , Mrs. Gould . There was one engineer , at least , on the railway staff who got warned off with a gun , too . Old Viola does not allow any trifling with his honour . He has grown uneasy and suspicious since his wife died . He was very pleased to remove his youngest girl away from the town . But look what happens , Mrs. Gould . Ramirez , the honest , lovelorn swain , is forbidden the island . Very well . He respects the prohibition , but naturally turns his eyes frequently towards the Great Isabel . It seems as though he had been in the habit of gazing late at night upon the light . And during these sentimental vigils he discovers that Nostromo , Captain Fidanza that is , returns very late from his visits to the Violas . As late as midnight at times . "
184361	184370	184371	184371	she	6199	" Yes . But I do n't understand , "
184377	184384	184387	184388	Dr. Monygham	249	" Now comes the strange part , "
184390	184710	184387	184388	Dr. Monygham	249	" Viola , who is king on his island , will allow no visitor on it after dark . Even Captain Fidanza has got to leave after sunset , when Linda has gone up to tend the light . And Nostromo goes away obediently . But what happens afterwards ? What does he do in the gulf between half - past six and midnight ? He has been seen more than once at that late hour pulling quietly into the harbour . Ramirez is devoured by jealousy . He dared not approach old Viola ; but he plucked up courage to rail at Linda about it on Sunday morning as she came on the mainland to hear mass and visit her mother 's grave . There was a scene on the wharf , which , as a matter of fact , I witnessed . It was early morning . He must have been waiting for her on purpose . I was there by the merest chance , having been called to an urgent consultation by the doctor of the German gunboat in the harbour . She poured wrath , scorn , and flame upon Ramirez , who seemed out of his mind . It was a strange sight , Mrs. Gould : the long jetty , with this raving Cargador in his crimson sash and the girl all in black , at the end ; the early Sunday morning quiet of the harbour in the shade of the mountains ; nothing but a canoe or two moving between the ships at anchor , and the German gunboat 's gig coming to take me off . Linda passed me within a foot . I noticed her wild eyes . I called out to her . She never heard me . She never saw me . But I looked at her face . It was awful in its anger and wretchedness . "
184722	184743	184711	184712	Mrs. Gould	248	" What do you mean , Dr. Monygham ? Do you mean to say that you suspect the younger sister ? "
184744	184752	184754	184755	the doctor	6199	" Quien sabe ! Who can tell ? "
184765	185174	184758	184758	his	6199	" Ramirez came up to me on the wharf . He reeled - he looked insane . He took his head into his hands . He had to talk to someone - simply had to . Of course for all his mad state he recognized me . People know me well here . I have lived too long amongst them to be anything else but the evil - eyed doctor , who can cure all the ills of the flesh , and bring bad luck by a glance . He came up to me . He tried to be calm . He tried to make it out that he wanted merely to warn me against Nostromo . It seems that Captain Fidanza at some secret meeting or other had mentioned me as the worst despiser of all the poor - of the people . It 's very possible . He honours me with his undying dislike . And a word from the great Fidanza may be quite enough to send some fool 's knife into my back . The Sanitary Commission I preside over is not in favour with the populace . ' Beware of him , senor doctor . Destroy him , senor doctor , ' Ramirez hissed right into my face . And then he broke out . ' That man , ' he spluttered , ' has cast a spell upon both these girls . ' As to himself , he had said too much . He must run away now - run away and hide somewhere . He moaned tenderly about Giselle , and then called her names that can not be repeated . If he thought she could be made to love him by any means , he would carry her off from the island . Off into the woods . But it was no good . . . . He strode away , flourishing his arms above his head . Then I noticed an old negro , who had been sitting behind a pile of cases , fishing from the wharf . He wound up his lines and slunk away at once . But he must have heard something , and must have talked , too , because some of the old Garibaldino 's railway friends , I suppose , warned him against Ramirez . At any rate , the father has been warned . But Ramirez has disappeared from the town . "
185175	185186	185188	185189	Mrs. Gould	248	" I feel I have a duty towards these girls , "
185193	185200	185188	185189	Mrs. Gould	248	" Is Nostromo in Sulaco now ? "
185201	185209	184758	184758	his	6199	" He is , since last Sunday . "
185210	185221	184758	184758	his	6199	" He ought to be spoken to - at once . "
185222	185246	185188	185189	Mrs. Gould	248	" Who will dare speak to him ? Even the love - mad Ramirez runs away from the mere shadow of Captain Fidanza . "
185247	185254	185255	185256	Mrs. Gould	248	" I can . I will , "
185259	185271	185255	185256	Mrs. Gould	248	" A word will be enough for a man like Nostromo . "
185277	185298	185272	185273	The doctor	6199	" He must end this situation which lends itself to - - I ca n't believe it of that child , "
185303	185309	185311	185312	the doctor	6199	" He 's very attractive , "
185316	185340	185311	185312	the doctor	6199	" He 'll see it , I am sure . He must put an end to all this by marrying Linda at once , "
185478	185485	185487	185488	Mrs. Gould	248	" What is it , Basilio ? "
185490	185514	185487	185488	Mrs. Gould	248	" A telephone came through from the office of the mine . The master remains to sleep at the mountain to - night . "
185548	185554	185556	185557	Mrs. Gould	248	" Very well , Basilio , "
186106	186108	186136	186138	the Senor Administrador	1589	" incorrigible "

188955	188960	188927	188927	Her	284	" Eh , Giorgio ? "
189099	189106	189107	189107	he	267	" The light is private property , "
189112	189163	189107	189107	he	267	" It belongs to my Company . I 've the power to nominate whom I like , and Viola it shall be . It 's about the only thing Nostromo - a man worth his weight in gold , mind you - has ever asked me to do for him . "
189372	189378	189380	189382	the old man	953	" It is good here , "
189403	189442	189393	189393	Nostromo	251	" You saw my schooner pass in not two hours ago ? Do you know why I am here before , so to speak , my anchor has fairly bitten into the ground of this port of Sulaco ? "
189443	189451	189452	189454	the old man	953	" You are welcome like a son , "
189465	189507	189452	189454	the old man	953	" Ah ! thy son . I know . I am what thy son would have been . It is well , viejo . It is a very good welcome . Listen , I have come to ask you for - - "
189547	189552	189556	189556	His	251	" For my wife ! "
189562	189569	189556	189556	His	251	" It is time you - - "
189579	189588	189589	189589	He	251	" That was left for you to judge . "

189825	189835	189836	189837	Old Viola	270	" Behold thy husband , master , and benefactor . "
189877	189889	189890	189890	he	251	" It is time , Linda , we two were betrothed , "
189933	189944	189904	189904	She	5311	" And so the soul of the dead is satisfied . "

190051	190057	190058	190058	he	251	" Yes . I knew , "
190111	190172	190100	190100	Linda	284	" I was yours ever since I can remember . I had only to think of you for the earth to become empty to my eyes . When you were there , I could see no one else . I was yours . Nothing is changed . The world belongs to you , and you let me live in it . "
190415	190423	190408	190409	Old Giorgio	270	" Where are you going , Linda ? "
190424	190432	190411	190411	his	270	" To the light , padre mio . "
190433	190442	190443	190443	He	270	" Si , si - to your duty . "
190476	190503	190504	190504	He	270	" I am going in to cook something . Aha ! Son ! The old man knows where to find a bottle of wine , too . "
190516	190564	190504	190504	He	270	" And you , little one , pray not to the God of priests and slaves , but to the God of orphans , of the oppressed , of the poor , of little children , to give thee a man like this one for a husband . "
190685	190692	190681	190681	He	270	" They say you love Ramirez . "
190760	190763	190764	190764	she	387	" No , "
190769	190788	190764	190764	she	387	" I never loved him . I think I never . . . He loves me - perhaps . "
190817	190825	190827	190827	Nostromo	251	" Ramirez told you he loved you ? "
190832	190842	190827	190827	Nostromo	251	" Ah ! once - one evening . . . "
190843	190851	190852	190852	He	270	" The miserable . . . Ha ! "
190873	190891	190892	190892	she	387	" Misericordia Divina ! You , too , Gian ' Battista ! Poor wretch that I am ! "
190898	190950	190892	190892	she	387	" I told Linda , and she scolded - she scolded . Am I to live blind , dumb , and deaf in this world ? And she told father , who took down his gun and cleaned it . Poor Ramirez ! Then you came , and she told you . "
191098	191148	191149	191149	He	270	" And between you three you have brought me here into this captivity to the sky and water . Nothing else . Sky and water . Oh , Sanctissima Madre . My hair shall turn grey on this tedious island . I could hate you , Gian ' Battista ! "
191256	191283	191252	191252	He	270	" Your hair like gold , and your eyes like violets , and your lips like the rose ; your round arms , your white throat . "
191348	191353	191339	191339	He	270	" Your little feet ! "
191388	191428	191379	191379	her	284	" And so you are going at last to marry our Linda . She is terrible . Ah ! now she will understand better since you have told her you love her . She will not be so fierce . "
191429	191432	191434	191434	Nostromo	251	" Chica ! "
191436	191444	191434	191434	Nostromo	251	" I have not told her anything . "
191445	191479	191379	191379	her	284	" Then make haste . Come to - morrow . Come and tell her , so that I may have some peace from her scolding and - perhaps - who knows . . . "
191480	191499	191379	191379	her	284	" Be allowed to listen to your Ramirez , eh ? Is that it ? You . . . "

191518	191533	191534	191534	she	5354	" Who is Ramirez . . . Ramirez . . . Who is he ? "
191591	191596	191597	191597	he	5357	" Listen , Giselle , "
191604	191623	191597	191597	he	5357	" I will tell no word of love to your sister . Do you want to know why ? "
191624	191674	191675	191675	She	5358	" Alas ! I could not understand perhaps , Giovanni . Father says you are not like other men ; that no one had ever understood you properly ; that the rich will be surprised yet . . . . Oh ! saints in heaven ! I am weary . "
191960	191967	191968	191968	he	251	" You have got to hear , "
191979	192012	191968	191968	he	251	" I shall say no word of love to your sister , to whom I am betrothed from this evening , because it is you that I love . It is you ! "
192285	192317	192277	192277	she	387	" God of mercy ! What will become of me - here - now - between this sky and this water I hate ? Linda , Linda - I see her ! "
192360	192440	192443	192443	she	5375	" Linda ! Poor Linda ! I tremble ! I shall die of fear before my poor sister Linda , betrothed to - day to Giovanni - my lover ! Giovanni , you must have been mad ! I can not understand you ! You are not like other men ! I will not give you up - never - only to God himself ! But why have you done this blind , mad , cruel , frightful thing ? "
192479	192489	192491	192491	Nostromo	251	" From fear of losing my hope of you , "
192493	192526	192527	192527	she	5375	" You knew that you had my soul ! You know everything ! It was made for you ! But what could stand between you and me ? What ? Tell me ! "
192537	192542	192543	192543	he	251	" Your dead mother , "
192549	192679	192543	192543	he	251	" Ah ! . . . Poor mother ! She has always . . . She is a saint in heaven now , and I can not give you up to her . No , Giovanni . Only to God alone . You were mad - but it is done . Oh ! what have you done ? Giovanni , my beloved , my life , my master , do not leave me here in this grave of clouds . You can not leave me now . You must take me away - at once - this instant - in the little boat . Giovanni , carry me off to - night , from my fear of Linda 's eyes , before I have to look at her again . "
192720	192725	192726	192726	he	5378	" I can not , "
192729	192748	192726	192726	he	5378	" Not yet . There is something that stands between us two and the freedom of the world . "
192766	192775	192776	192776	she	5377	" You rave , Giovanni - my lover ! "
192781	192810	192776	192776	she	5377	" What can there be ? Carry me off - in thy very hands - to Dona Emilia - away from here . I am not very heavy . "
192858	192868	192853	192853	she	5377	" I tell you I am afraid of Linda ! "
192882	192888	192889	192889	she	5377	" What can there be ? "
192934	192938	192939	192939	he	5378	" A treasure , "
192951	192968	192946	192946	She	5377	" A treasure . A treasure of silver to buy a gold crown for thy brow . "
192969	192973	192974	192974	she	5377	" A treasure ? "
192990	192997	192998	192998	She	5377	" What is it you say ? "
193066	193072	193073	193073	she	5377	" A treasure of silver ! "
193082	193095	193096	193096	He	5378	" What ? Where ? How did you get it , Giovanni ? "
193117	193122	193113	193113	he	5378	" Like a thief ! "
193175	193184	193172	193172	her	5377	" I love you ! I love you ! "
193508	193514	193515	193515	she	5377	" Make haste , then , "
193518	193549	193515	193515	she	5377	" Make haste , Giovanni , my lover , my master , for I will give thee up to no one but God . And I am afraid of Linda . "
193607	193620	193604	193604	she	5377	" Where is it ? Where ? Tell me that , Giovanni . "
193631	193638	193639	193639	he	5378	" Not that ! Not that ! "

193833	193841	193814	193814	He	5378	" Tell him I would not stay , "
193971	194022	194023	194023	He	5378	" Va bene . Let him go . Ha ! ha ! No matter how fair the woman , it galls a little . Liberty , liberty . There 's more than one kind ! He has said the great word , and son Gian ' Battista is not tame . "
194037	194045	194046	194046	he	5378	" A man should not be tame , "
194064	194078	194079	194079	he	5378	" Do not give way to the enviousness of your sister 's lot , "
194320	194323	194313	194313	She	284	" Giselle ! "

195148	195175	195145	195145	he	255	" No , do n't , Giovanni . Not - to - night . Linda and father have been talking together for a long time today . "
195176	195180	195245	195245	She	5445	" What about ? "
195181	195237	195238	195238	He	255	" Ramirez , I fancy I heard . I do not know . I am afraid . I am always afraid . It is like dying a thousand times a day . Your love is to me like your treasure to you . It is there , but I can never get enough of it . "
195352	195375	195349	195349	She	5445	" Give up the palazzo , Giovanni , and the vineyard on the hills , for which we are starving our love . "
195424	195430	195431	195431	he	251	" Have you been ill ? "
195450	195455	195456	195456	she	5448	" Am I thinner ? "
195459	195467	195456	195456	she	5448	" Yes - perhaps - a little . "
195468	195472	195443	195443	Her	5448	" And older ? "
195473	195483	195443	195443	Her	5448	" Every day counts - for all of us . "
195484	195501	195502	195502	she	5448	" I shall go grey , I fear , before the ring is on my finger , "
195530	195536	195537	195537	he	251	" No fear of that , "

196170	196183	196168	196168	Giselle	387	" Perhaps it is not true . It can not be true , "

196433	196507	196508	196508	She	5478	" But son Gian ' Battista told me - quite of himself - that the cowardly esclavo was drinking and gambling with the rascals of Zapiga , over there on the north side of the gulf . He may get some of the worst scoundrels of that scoundrelly town of negroes to help him in his attempt upon the little one . . . . But I am not so old . No ! "
196567	196574	196575	196575	he	953	" May be . May be , "
196631	196636	196637	196637	she	5478	" Listen - you , "

196811	196837	196804	196804	Linda	284	" Is he not ? Well , then , look to it ; because father has been walking about with a loaded gun at night . "
196838	196862	196888	196888	Giselle	387	" It is not good for him . You must tell him not to , Linda . He will not listen to me . "
196863	196876	196878	196878	Linda	284	" I shall say nothing - never any more - to anybody , "
197080	197088	197089	197089	she	284	" And with our mother looking on , "

197690	197711	197712	197712	He	252	" Like a thief he came , and like a thief he fell . The child had to be protected . "
197808	197839	197842	197843	her sister	5874	" I entreated you not to come to - night . Oh , my Giovanni ! And you promised . Oh ! Why - why did you come , Giovanni ? "

198392	198399	198378	198379	that man	614	" Antonia left her fan here . "
198423	198690	198417	198417	She	5536	" Mrs. Gould , you are wanted . Do you know what has happened ? You remember what I told you yesterday about Nostromo . Well , it seems that a lancha , a decked boat , coming from Zapiga , with four negroes in her , passing close to the Great Isabel , was hailed from the cliff by a woman 's voice - Linda 's , as a matter of fact - commanding them it 's a moonlight night to go round to the beach and take up a wounded man to the town . The patron from whom I 've heard all this , of course , did so at once . He told me that when they got round to the low side of the Great Isabel , they found Linda Viola waiting for them . They followed her : she led them under a tree not far from the cottage . There they found Nostromo lying on the ground with his head in the younger girl 's lap , and father Viola standing some distance off leaning on his gun . Under Linda 's direction they got a table out of the cottage for a stretcher , after breaking off the legs . They are here , Mrs. Gould . I mean Nostromo and - and Giselle . The negroes brought him in to the first - aid hospital near the harbour . He made the attendant send for me . But it was not me he wanted to see - it was you , Mrs. Gould ! It was you . "
198691	198694	198696	198697	Mrs. Gould	248	" Me ? "
198703	198708	198709	198710	the doctor	6199	" Yes , you ! "
198714	198745	198709	198710	the doctor	6199	" He begged me - his enemy , as he thinks - to bring you to him at once . It seems he has something to say to you alone . "
198746	198749	198751	198752	Mrs. Gould	248	" Impossible ! "
198754	198783	198784	198785	the doctor	6199	" He said to me , ' Remind her that I have done something to keep a roof over her head . ' . . . Mrs. Gould , "
198793	198810	198784	198785	the doctor	6199	" Do you remember the silver ? The silver in the lighter - that was lost ? "
198928	198935	198936	198937	the doctor	6199	" Was it lost , though ? "
198940	198970	198936	198937	the doctor	6199	" I 've always felt that there was a mystery about our Nostromo ever since . I do believe he wants now , at the point of death - - "
198971	198977	198979	198980	Mrs. Gould	248	" The point of death ? "
198982	199003	198979	198980	Mrs. Gould	248	" Yes . Yes . . . . He wants perhaps to tell you something concerning that silver which - - "
199004	199011	199013	199014	Mrs. Gould	248	" Oh , no ! No ! "
199021	199045	199013	199014	Mrs. Gould	248	" Is n't it lost and done with ? Is n't there enough treasure without it to make everybody in the world miserable ? "
199066	199092	199060	199060	he	6199	" And there is that Viola girl , Giselle . What are we to do ? It looks as though father and sister had - - "
199110	199117	199118	199119	the doctor	6199	" I have a volante here , "
199122	199133	199134	199134	He	6199	" If you do n't mind getting into that - - "
199250	199255	199256	199257	the Capataz	2385	" She is innocent , "
199287	199314	199315	199315	He	6199	" She is innocent . It is I alone . But no matter . For these things I would answer to no man or woman alive . "
199381	199468	199358	199358	her	387	" Ha ! Old Giorgio - the guardian of thine honour ! Fancy the Vecchio coming upon me so light of foot , so steady of aim . I myself could have done no better . But the price of a charge of powder might have been saved . The honour was safe . . . . Senora , she would have followed to the end of the world Nostromo the thief . . . . I have said the word . The spell is broken ! "
199482	199495	199496	199496	he	6199	" I can not see her . . . . No matter , "
199512	199625	199626	199626	He	5558	" One kiss is enough , if there is no time for more . An airy soul , senora ! Bright and warm , like sunshine - soon clouded , and soon serene . They would crush it there between them . Senora , cast on her the eye of your compassion , as famed from one end of the land to the other as the courage and daring of the man who speaks to you . She will console herself in time . And even Ramirez is not a bad fellow . I am not angry . No ! It is not Ramirez who overcame the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores . "
199644	199653	199626	199626	He	5558	" I die betrayed - betrayed by - - "
199669	199677	199678	199678	he	5558	" She would not have betrayed me , "
199688	199781	199678	199678	he	5558	" She was faithful . We were going very far - very soon . I could have torn myself away from that accursed treasure for her . For that child I would have left boxes and boxes of it - full . And Decoud took four . Four ingots . Why ? Picardia ! To betray me ? How could I give back the treasure with four ingots missing ? They would have said I had purloined them . The doctor would have said that . Alas ! it holds me yet ! "
199793	199805	199782	199783	Mrs. Gould	248	" What became of Don Martin on that night , Nostromo ? "
199806	199951	199956	199957	Mrs. Gould	248	" Who knows ? I wondered what would become of me . Now I know . Death was to come upon me unawares . He went away ! He betrayed me . And you think I have killed him ! You are all alike , you fine people . The silver has killed me . It has held me . It holds me yet . Nobody knows where it is . But you are the wife of Don Carlos , who put it into my hands and said , ' Save it on your life . ' And when I returned , and you all thought it was lost , what do I hear ? ' It was nothing of importance . Let it go . Up , Nostromo , the faithful , and ride away to save us , for dear life ! ' "
199952	199955	199956	199957	Mrs. Gould	248	" Nostromo ! "
199964	199983	199956	199957	Mrs. Gould	248	" I , too , have hated the idea of that silver from the bottom of my heart . "
199984	200062	200070	200070	his	5559	" Marvellous ! - that one of you should hate the wealth that you know so well how to take from the hands of the poor . The world rests upon the poor , as old Giorgio says . You have been always good to the poor . But there is something accursed in wealth . Senora , shall I tell you where the treasure is ? To you alone . . . . Shining ! Incorruptible ! "
200112	200117	200118	200118	she	248	" No , Capataz , "
200121	200135	200118	200118	she	248	" No one misses it now . Let it be lost for ever . "
200184	200190	200191	200191	he	249	" Now , Mrs. Gould , "
200200	200230	200191	200191	he	249	" tell me , was I right ? There is a mystery . You have got the word of it , have you not ? He told you - - "
200231	200237	200239	200240	Mrs. Gould	248	" He told me nothing , "
200340	200350	200352	200353	Mrs. Gould	248	" Pray send at once somebody for my carriage , "
200366	200381	200363	200364	Giselle Viola	387	" Come nearer me , child ; come closer . We will wait here . "
200517	200534	200515	200515	himself	249	" Console yourself , child . Very soon he would have forgotten you for his treasure . "
200535	200546	200547	200547	Giselle	387	" Senora , he loved me . He loved me , "
200552	200565	200547	200547	Giselle	387	" He loved me as no one had ever been loved before . "
200566	200574	200575	200576	Mrs. Gould	248	" I have been loved , too , "
200589	200606	200607	200607	she	387	" Oh , senora , but you shall live adored to the end of your life , "
200648	200654	200655	200655	she	248	" You can do nothing ? "
200658	200690	200655	200655	she	248	" No , Mrs. Gould . Moreover , he wo n't let us touch him . It does not matter . I just had one look . . . . Useless . "
200884	200894	200895	200895	he	5594	" Have you any dispositions to make , comrade ? "
200900	200922	200895	200895	he	5594	" Do not forget that we want money for our work . The rich must be fought with their own weapons . "
200960	200964	200965	200965	he	5594	" Comrade Fidanza , "
200970	200990	200965	200965	he	5594	" you have refused all aid from that doctor . Is he really a dangerous enemy of the people ? "
201110	201114	201115	201115	he	249	" Pull easy , "
201142	201146	201147	201147	he	249	" Pull easy , "
201235	201244	201245	201245	he	249	" Do you know whom you have killed ? "
201248	201253	201254	201254	White	524	" Ramirez the vagabond . "
201301	201313	201293	201295	the old man	953	" He cried out in son Gian ' Battista 's voice . "
201340	201353	201354	201354	He	249	" You are too old to understand . Come into the house . "
201407	201416	201417	201417	he	249	" In son Gian ' Battista 's voice , "
201424	201435	201417	201417	he	249	" I heard him - Ramirez - the miserable - - "
201453	201461	201436	201436	Linda	284	" You have killed Gian ' Battista . "
201476	201482	201483	201483	he	249	" Where is the child ? "
201528	201533	201534	201534	she	284	" She is asleep , "
201537	201545	201534	201534	she	284	" We shall talk of her tomorrow . "
201603	201609	201598	201598	He	249	" Give me the book . "
201636	201644	201645	201645	he	249	" The child had to be protected , "
201679	201685	201686	201686	he	249	" Where are you going ? "
201689	201694	201695	201695	she	284	" To the light , "
201706	201714	201695	201695	she	284	" The light ! Si - duty . "
201980	201983	201984	201984	he	249	" Linda ! "
201992	201995	201984	201984	he	249	" Linda ! "
202006	202011	202012	202012	she	284	" Is he dead ? "
202018	202030	202031	202032	the doctor	6199	" Yes , my poor girl . I am coming round , "
202037	202043	202044	202044	he	249	" Pull to the beach , "
202080	202088	202089	202089	she	284	" It is I who loved you , "
202105	202142	202089	202089	she	284	" I ! Only I ! She will forget thee , killed miserably for her pretty face . I can not understand . I can not understand . But I shall never forget thee . Never ! "
202170	202177	202143	202143	She	284	" Never ! Gian ' Battista ! "
