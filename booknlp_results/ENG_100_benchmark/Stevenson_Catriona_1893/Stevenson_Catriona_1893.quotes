2328	2331	2333	2333	I	0	" Madam , "
2335	2401	2333	2333	I	0	" I think it only fair to myself to let you understand I have no Gaelic . It is true I was listening , for I have friends of my own across the Highland line , and the sound of that tongue comes friendly ; but for your private affairs , if you had spoken Greek , I might have had more guess at them . "
2411	2418	2420	2420	she	532	" There is no harm done , "
2435	2444	2420	2420	she	532	" A cat may look at a king . "
2445	2453	2455	2455	I.	0	" I do not mean to offend , "
2456	2503	2455	2455	I.	0	" I have no skill of city manners ; I never before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh . Take me for a country lad it s what I am ; and I would rather I told you than you found it out . "
2504	2526	2527	2527	she	532	" Indeed , it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to each other on the causeway , "
2530	2567	2527	2527	she	532	" But if you are landward 2 bred it will be different . I am as landward as yourself ; I am Highland , as you see , and think myself the farther from my home . "
2568	2581	2583	2583	I.	533	" It is not yet a week since I passed the line , "
2584	2598	2583	2583	I.	533	" Less than a week ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder . "
2599	2602	2603	2603	she	532	" Balwhither ? "
2606	2642	2603	2603	she	532	" Come ye from Balwhither ! The name of it makes all there is of me rejoice . You will not have been long there , and not known some of our friends or family ? "
2643	2658	2659	2659	I	0	" I lived with a very honest , kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren , "
2662	2677	2678	2678	she	532	" Well , I know Duncan , and you give him the true name ! "
2681	2696	2678	2678	she	532	" and if he is an honest man , his wife is honest indeed . "
2697	2700	2702	2702	I	0	" Ay , "
2704	2718	2702	2702	I	0	" they are fine people , and the place is a bonny place . "
2719	2729	2730	2730	she	532	" Where in the great world is such another ! "
2733	2749	2730	2730	she	532	" I am loving the smell of that place and the roots that grow there . "
2761	2776	2778	2778	I.	0	" I could be wishing I had brought you a spray of that heather , "
2779	2865	2867	2867	I	0	" And , though I did ill to speak with you at the first , now it seems we have common acquaintance , I make it my petition you will not forget me . David Balfour is the name I am known by . This is my lucky day , when I have just come into a landed estate , and am not very long out of a deadly peril . I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of Balwhidder , "
2869	2882	2867	2867	I	0	" and I will yours for the sake of my lucky day . "
2883	2890	2891	2891	she	535	" My name is not spoken , "
2901	2940	2891	2891	she	535	" More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men s tongues , save for a blink . I am nameless , like the Folk of Peace . 3 Catriona Drummond is the one I use . "
2986	3002	3004	3004	I	0	" I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself , "
3006	3024	3004	3004	I	0	" and I think he will be one of your friends . They called him Robin Oig . "
3025	3030	3032	3032	she	537	" Did ye so ? "
3034	3039	3032	3032	she	537	" Ye met Rob ? "
3040	3048	3050	3050	I.	0	" I passed the night with him , "
3051	3060	3062	3062	she	537	" He is a fowl of the night , "
3064	3073	3074	3074	I	0	" There was a set of pipes there , "
3078	3088	3074	3074	I	0	" so you may judge if the time passed . "
3089	3100	3102	3102	she	537	" You should be no enemy , at all events , "
3104	3129	3102	3102	she	537	" That was his brother there a moment since , with the red soldiers round him . It is him that I call father . "
3130	3135	3137	3137	I.	0	" Is it so ? "
3138	3148	3137	3137	I.	0	" Are you a daughter of James More s ? "
3149	3157	3159	3159	she	537	" All the daughter that he has , "
3161	3185	3159	3159	she	537	" the daughter of a prisoner ; that I should forget it so , even for one hour , to talk with strangers ! "
3203	3205	3195	3195	he	538	" she "
3214	3218	3195	3195	he	538	" ta sneeshin . "
3253	3263	3264	3264	she	537	" There can be none the day , Neil , "
3267	3305	3264	3264	she	537	" How will you get sneeshin , wanting siller ! It will teach you another time to be more careful ; and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil of the Tom . "
3306	3310	3311	3311	I	0	" Miss Drummond , "
3314	3352	3311	3311	I	0	" I told you I was in my lucky day . Here I am , and a bank - porter at my tail . And remember I have had the hospitality of your own country of Balwhidder . "
3353	3364	3366	3366	she	541	" It was not one of my people gave it , "
3368	3373	3375	3375	I	0	" Ah , well , "
3377	3422	3375	3375	I	0	" but I am owing your uncle at least for some springs upon the pipes . Besides which , I have offered myself to be your friend , and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper time . "
3423	3439	3441	3441	she	541	" If it had been a great sum , it might have done you honour , "
3443	3479	3441	3441	she	541	" but I will tell you what this is . James More lies shackled in prison ; but this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the Advocate s. . . . "
3480	3485	3486	3486	I	0	" The Advocate s ! "
3489	3496	3486	3486	I	0	" Is that . . . ? "
3497	3510	3512	3512	she	541	" It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange , "
3514	3638	3512	3512	she	541	" There they bring my father one time and another , for what purpose I have no thought in my mind ; but it seems there is some hope dawned for him . All this same time they will not let me be seeing him , nor yet him write ; and we wait upon the King s street to catch him ; and now we give him his snuff as he goes by , and now something else . And here is this son of trouble , Neil , son of Duncan , has lost my four - penny piece that was to buy that snuff , and James More must go wanting , and will think his daughter has forgotten him . "
3663	3672	3674	3674	I.	0	" That sixpence came with me by Balwhidder , "
3675	3678	3679	3679	she	542	" Ah ! "
3682	3691	3679	3679	she	542	" you are a friend to the Gregara ! "
3692	3703	3705	3705	I.	0	" I would not like to deceive you , either , "
3706	3763	3705	3705	I.	0	" I know very little of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings , but since the while I have been standing in this close , I seem to know something of yourself ; and if you will just say a friend to Miss Catriona I will see you are the less cheated . "
3764	3774	3776	3776	she	543	" The one can not be without the other , "
3778	3784	3786	3786	I.	0	" I will even try , "
3787	3797	3798	3798	she	543	" And what will you be thinking of myself ! "
3801	3812	3798	3798	she	543	" to be holding my hand to the first stranger ! "
3813	3826	3828	3828	I.	0	" I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter , "
3829	3838	3839	3839	she	543	" I must not be without repaying it , "
3842	3849	3839	3839	she	543	" where is it you stop ! "
3850	3862	3864	3864	I	0	" To tell the truth , I am stopping nowhere yet , "
3866	3898	3864	3864	I	0	" being not full three hours in the city ; but if you will give me your direction , I will be so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself . "
3899	3908	3909	3909	she	543	" Will I can trust you for that ? "
3912	3919	3921	3921	I.	0	" You need have little fear , "
3922	3931	3933	3933	she	543	" James More could not bear it else , "
3935	3973	3933	3933	she	543	" I stop beyond the village of Dean , on the north side of the water , with Mrs. Drummond - Ogilvy of Allardyce , who is my near friend and will be glad to thank you . "
3974	3993	3995	3995	I	0	" You are to see me , then , so soon as what I have to do permits , "
4071	4085	4086	4086	he	546	" I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o sense , "
4094	4123	4124	4124	he	546	" Ye re no likely to gang far this gate . A fule and his siller s shune parted . Eh , but ye re a green callant ! "

4140	4153	4154	4154	I	0	" If you dare to speak of the young lady . . . "
4157	4160	4161	4161	he	546	" Leddy ! "
4164	4201	4161	4161	he	546	" Haud us and safe us , whatten leddy ? Ca thon a leddy ? The toun s fu o them . Leddies ! Man , its weel seen ye re no very acquant in Embro ! "
4209	4212	4214	4214	I	0	" Here , "
4216	4231	4214	4214	I	0	" lead me where I told you , and keep your foul mouth shut ! "
4272	4323	4249	4249	he	546	" As Mally Lee cam doun the street , her capuchin did flee , She cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee . And we re a gaun east and wast , we re a gann ajee , We re a gaun east and wast courtin Mally Lee . "

4534	4538	4540	4540	he	556	" The same , "
4542	4558	4540	4540	he	556	" and , if the question is equally fair , who may you be yourself ? "
4559	4572	4574	4574	I	0	" You never heard tell of my name nor of me either , "
4576	4596	4597	4597	I	0	" but I bring you a token from a friend that you know well . That you know well , "
4604	4654	4601	4601	my	0	" but maybe are not just so keen to hear from at this present being . And the bits of business that I have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential . In short , I would like to think we were quite private . "
4690	4695	4697	4697	he	556	" Now , sir , "
4701	4715	4716	4716	he	556	" speak out your mind and fear nothing ; though before you begin , "
4720	4775	4697	4697	he	556	" I tell you mine misgives me ! I tell you beforehand , ye re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye . A good name it is , and one it would ill - become my father s son to lightly . But I begin to grue at the sound of it . "
4776	4783	4785	4785	I	0	" My name is called Balfour , "
4787	4807	4785	4785	I	0	" David Balfour of Shaws . As for him that sent me , I will let his token speak . "
4815	4824	4826	4826	he	561	" Put it in your pocket , sir ! "
4828	4858	4826	4826	he	561	" Ye need name no names . The deevil s buckie , I ken the button of him ! And de il hae t ! Where is he now ! "
4909	4929	4930	4930	he	561	" It s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family of mine , "
4933	4968	4930	4930	he	561	" and , dod ! I believe the day s come now ! Get a ship for him , quot he ! And who s to pay for it ? The man s daft ! "
4969	4981	4983	4983	I.	0	" That is my part of the affair , Mr. Stewart , "
4984	5009	4983	4983	I.	0	" Here is a bag of good money , and if more be wanted , more is to be had where it came from . "
5010	5018	5020	5020	he	561	" I needn t ask your politics , "
5022	5027	5029	5029	I	0	" Ye need not , "
5033	5044	5029	5029	I	0	" for I m as big a Whig as grows . "
5045	5054	5056	5057	Mr. Stewart	199	" Stop a bit , stop a bit , "
5059	5154	5056	5057	Mr. Stewart	199	" What s all this ? A Whig ? Then why are you here with Alan s button ? and what kind of a black - foot traffic is this that I find ye out in , Mr. Whig ? Here is a forfeited rebel and an accused murderer , with two hundred pounds on his life , and ye ask me to meddle in his business , and then tell me ye re a Whig ! I have no mind of any such Whigs before , though I ve kent plenty of them . "
5155	5168	5170	5170	I	0	" He s a forfeited rebel , the more s the pity , "
5172	5208	5170	5170	I	0	" for the man s my friend . I can only wish he had been better guided . And an accused murderer , that he is too , for his misfortune ; but wrongfully accused . "
5209	5216	5218	5218	Stewart	185	" I hear you say so , "
5220	5234	5236	5236	I.	0	" More than you are to hear me say so , before long , "
5237	5248	5236	5236	I.	0	" Alan Breck is innocent , and so is James . "
5249	5252	5254	5254	he	185	" Oh ! "
5256	5274	5254	5254	he	185	" the two cases hang together . If Alan is out , James can never be in . "
5316	5331	5332	5332	I	0	" So , sir , you have now the whole train of these events , "
5336	5419	5332	5332	I	0	" and can see for yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with the affairs of your family and friends , which for all of our sakes I wish had been plainer and less bloody . You can see for yourself , too , that I have certain pieces of business depending , which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer chosen at random . No more remains , but to ask if you will undertake my service ? "
5420	5446	5448	5448	he	565	" I have no great mind to it ; but coming as you do with Alan s button , the choice is scarcely left me , "
5450	5456	5457	5457	he	565	" What are your instructions ? "
5466	5479	5481	5481	I	0	" The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country , "
5483	5492	5481	5481	I	0	" but I need not be repeating that . "
5493	5502	5504	5504	Stewart	185	" I am little likely to forget it , "
5506	5520	5521	5521	I	0	" The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny , "
5525	5559	5521	5521	I	0	" It would be ill for me to find a conveyance , but that should be no stick to you . It was two pounds five shillings and three - halfpence farthing sterling . "
5564	5567	5569	5569	I	0	" Then , "
5571	5629	5569	5569	I	0	" there s a Mr. Henderland , a licensed preacher and missionary in Ardgour , that I would like well to get some snuff into the hands of ; and , as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in Appin so near by , it s a job you could doubtless overtake with the other . "
5630	5639	5640	5640	he	565	" How much snuff are we to say ? "
5643	5651	5653	5653	I.	0	" I was thinking of two pounds , "
5654	5657	5659	5659	he	565	" Two , "
5661	5674	5676	5676	I.	0	" Then there s the lass Alison Hastie , in Lime Kilns , "
5677	5734	5676	5676	I.	0	" Her that helped Alan and me across the Forth . I was thinking if I could get her a good Sunday gown , such as she could wear with decency in her degree , it would be an ease to my conscience ; for the mere truth is , we owe her our two lives . "
5735	5748	5750	5750	he	565	" I am glad so see you are thrifty , Mr. Balfour , "
5756	5771	5773	5773	I.	566	" I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune , "
5774	5864	5865	5865	I	0	" And now , if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges , I would be glad to know if I could get some spending - money back . It s not that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe ; it s not that I lack more ; but having drawn so much the one day , I think it would have a very ill appearance if I was back again seeking , the next . Only be sure you have enough , "
5868	5880	5865	5865	I	0	" for I am very undesirous to meet with you again . "
5881	5896	5898	5899	the Writer	547	" Well , and I m pleased to see you re cautious , too , "
5901	5919	5898	5899	the Writer	547	" But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my discretion . "
5928	5937	5938	5938	I	0	" I ll have to run the hazard , "
5941	6006	5938	5938	I	0	" O , and there s another service I would ask , and that s to direct me to a lodging , for I have no roof to my head . But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by accident , for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to get any jealousy of our acquaintance . "
6007	6017	6019	6019	he	547	" Ye may set your weary spirit at rest , "
6021	6054	6019	6019	he	547	" I will never name your name , sir ; and it s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence . "
6068	6080	6082	6082	I	0	" There s a braw day coming for him , then , "
6084	6113	6082	6082	I	0	" for he ll have to learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to - morrow , when I call on him . "
6114	6121	6123	6124	Mr. Stewart	199	" When ye call on him ! "
6126	6142	6123	6124	Mr. Stewart	199	" Am I daft , or are you ! What takes ye near the Advocate ! "
6143	6152	6154	6154	I.	0	" O , just to give myself up , "
6155	6159	6160	6160	he	199	" Mr. Balfour , "
6163	6172	6160	6160	he	199	" are ye making a mock of me ? "
6173	6178	6180	6180	I	0	" No , sir , "
6182	6214	6180	6180	I	0	" though I think you have allowed yourself some such freedom with myself . But I give you to understand once and for all that I am in no jesting spirit . "
6215	6220	6222	6222	Stewart	199	" Nor yet me , "
6224	6328	6222	6222	Stewart	199	" And I give yon to understand if that s to be the word that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less . You come here to me with all sorts of propositions , which will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons this many a day to come . And then you tell me you re going straight out of my office to make your peace with the Advocate ! Alan s button here or Alan s button there , the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further in . "
6329	6340	6342	6342	I	0	" I would take it with a little more temper , "
6344	6451	6342	6342	I	0	" and perhaps we can avoid what you object to . I can see no way for it but to give myself up , but perhaps you can see another ; and if you could , I could never deny but what I would be rather relieved . For I think my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health . There s just the one thing clear , that I have to give my evidence ; for I hope it ll save Alan s character what s left of it , and James s neck , which is the more immediate . "
6464	6468	6470	6470	he	569	" My man , "
6472	6483	6470	6470	he	569	" you ll never be allowed to give such evidence . "
6484	6493	6495	6495	I	0	" We ll have to see about that , "
6497	6507	6495	6495	I	0	" I m stiff - necked when I like . "
6508	6513	6515	6515	Stewart	181	" Ye muckle ass ! "
6517	6566	6515	6515	Stewart	181	" it s James they want ; James has got to hang Alan , too , if they could catch him but James whatever ! Go near the Advocate with any such business , and you ll see ! he ll find a way to muzzle , ye . "
6567	6577	6579	6579	I.	0	" I think better of the Advocate than that , "
6580	6586	6588	6588	he	181	" The Advocate be dammed ! "
6590	6663	6664	6664	he	181	" It s the Campbells , man ! You ll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back ; and so will the Advocate too , poor body ! It s extraordinar ye can not see where ye stand ! If there s no fair way to stop your gab , there s a foul one gaping . They can put ye in the dock , do ye no see that ? "
6677	6680	6682	6682	I	0	" Ay , "
6684	6700	6682	6682	I	0	" I was told that same no further back than this morning by another lawyer . "
6701	6707	6709	6709	Stewart	181	" And who was he ? "
6711	6718	6709	6709	Stewart	181	" He spoke sense at least . "
6750	6764	6766	6766	Stewart	181	" I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it ! "
6768	6774	6766	6766	Stewart	181	" But what said you ? "
6775	6791	6719	6719	I	0	" I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the house of Shaws .
6792	6801	6803	6803	he	181	" Well , and so ye will hang ! "
6805	6819	6803	6803	he	181	" Ye ll hang beside James Stewart . There s your fortune told . "
6820	6830	6832	6832	I	0	" I hope better of it yet than that , "
6834	6845	6832	6832	I	0	" but I could never deny there was a risk . "
6846	6849	6851	6851	he	181	" Risk ! "
6859	6881	6882	6882	he	181	" I ought to thank you for your staunchness to my friends , to whom you show a very good spirit , "
6885	6982	6882	6882	he	181	" if you have the strength to stand by it . But I warn you that you re wading deep . I wouldn t put myself in your place me that s a Stewart born ! for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah . Risk ? ay , I take over - many ; but to be tried in court before a Campbell jury and a Campbell judge , and that in a Campbell country and upon a Campbell quarrel think what you like of me , Balfour , it s beyond me . "
6983	6995	6997	6997	I	0	" It s a different way of thinking , I suppose , "
6999	7013	6997	6997	I	0	" I was brought up to this one by my father before me . "
7014	7030	7032	7032	he	571	" Glory to his bones ! he has left a decent son to his name , "
7034	7101	7032	7032	he	571	" Yet I would not have you judge me over - sorely . My case is dooms hard . See , sir , ye tell me ye re a Whig : I wonder what I am . No Whig to be sure ; I couldnae be just that . But laigh in your ear , man I m maybe no very keen on the other side . "
7102	7108	7110	7110	I.	572	" Is that a fact ? "
7111	7125	7032	7032	he	571	" It s what I would think of a man of your intelligence . "
7126	7134	7137	7137	he	573	" Hut ! none of your whillywhas ! "
7139	7245	7137	7137	he	573	" There s intelligence upon both sides . But for my private part I have no particular desire to harm King George ; and as for King James , God bless him ! he does very well for me across the water . I m a lawyer , ye see : fond of my books and my bottle , a good plea , a well - drawn deed , a crack in the Parliament House with other lawyer bodies , and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at e en . Where do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores ? "
7246	7249	7251	7251	I	0	" Well , "
7253	7266	7251	7251	I	0	" it s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman . "
7267	7270	7032	7032	he	571	" Little ? "
7274	7573	7032	7032	he	571	" Nothing , man ! And yet I m Hieland born , and when the clan pipes , who but me has to dance ! The clan and the name , that goes by all . It s just what you said yourself ; my father learned it to me , and a bonny trade I have of it . Treason and traitors , and the smuggling of them out and in ; and the French recruiting , weary fall it ! and the smuggling through of the recruits ; and their pleas a sorrow of their pleas ! Here have I been moving one for young Ardsheil , my cousin ; claimed the estate under the marriage contract a forfeited estate ! I told them it was nonsense : muckle they cared ! And there was I cocking behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself , for it was fair ruin to the pair of us a black mark , disaffected , branded on our hurdies , like folk s names upon their kye ! And what can I do ? I m a Stewart , ye see , and must fend for my clan and family . Then no later by than yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle . What for ? I ken fine : Act of 1736 : recruiting for King Lewie . And you ll see , he ll whistle me in to be his lawyer , and there ll be another black mark on my chara ter ! I tell you fair : if I but kent the heid of a Hebrew word from the hurdies of it , be dammed but I would fling the whole thing up and turn minister ! "
7574	7582	7584	7584	I.	574	" It s rather a hard position , "
7585	7589	7591	7591	he	575	" Dooms hard ! "
7593	7637	7591	7591	he	575	" And that s what makes me think so much of ye you that s no Stewart to stick your head so deep in Stewart business . And for what , I do not know : unless it was the sense of duty . "
7638	7646	7648	7648	I.	574	" I hope it will be that , "
7649	7652	7654	7654	he	575	" Well , "
7656	7756	7654	7654	he	575	" it s a grand quality . But here is my clerk back ; and , by your leave , we ll pick a bit of dinner , all the three of us . When that s done , I ll give you the direction of a very decent man , that ll be very fain to have you for a lodger . And I ll fill your pockets to ye , forbye , out of your ain bag . For this business ll not be near as dear as ye suppose not even the ship part of it . "
7769	7778	7780	7780	he	575	" Hoot , ye neednae mind for Robbie , "
7782	7836	7780	7780	he	575	" A Stewart , too , puir deevil ! and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking Papists than what he has hairs upon his face . Why , it s Robin that manages that branch of my affairs . Who will we have now , Rob , for across the water ! "
7837	7848	7850	7850	Rob	191	" There ll be Andie Scougal , in the Thristle , "
7852	7911	7850	7850	Rob	191	" I saw Hoseason the other day , but it seems he s wanting the ship . Then there ll be Tam Stobo ; but I m none so sure of Tam . I ve seen him colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances ; and if was anybody important , I would give Tam the go - by . "
7912	7923	7925	7925	Stewart	181	" The head s worth two hundred pounds , Robin , "
7927	7937	7939	7940	the clerk	551	" Gosh , that ll no be Alan Breck ! "
7942	7946	7948	7949	his master	549	" Just Alan , "
7951	7959	7961	7961	Robin	191	" Weary winds ! that s sayrious , "
7963	7977	7961	7961	Robin	191	" I ll try Andie , then ; Andie ll be the best . "
7978	7988	7989	7989	I	0	" It seems it s quite a big business , "
7992	8003	8005	8005	Stewart	181	" Mr. Balfour , there s no end to it , "
8007	8016	8017	8017	I	0	" There was a name your clerk mentioned , "
8021	8048	8017	8017	I	0	" Hoseason . That must be my man , I think : Hoseason , of the brig Covenant . Would you set your trust on him ? "
8049	8060	8062	8063	Mr. Stewart	199	" He didnae behave very well to you and Alan , "
8065	8109	8062	8063	Mr. Stewart	199	" but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise . If he had taken Alan on board his ship on an agreement , it s my notion he would have proved a just dealer . How say ye , Rob ? "
8110	8121	8123	8124	the clerk	551	" No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli , "
8126	8147	8148	8148	he	551	" I would lippen to 5 Eli s word ay , if it was the Chevalier , or Appin himsel , "
8151	8164	8166	8167	the master	581	" And it was him that brought the doctor , wasnae t ? "
8169	8176	8178	8179	the clerk	551	" He was the very man , "
8181	8191	8193	8193	Stewart	185	" And I think he took the doctor back ? "
8195	8203	8205	8205	Robin	191	" Ay , with his sporran full ! "
8207	8214	8205	8205	Robin	191	" And Eli kent of that ! "
8216	8229	8231	8231	I.	583	" Well , it seems it s hard to ken folk rightly , "
8232	8247	8249	8250	the Writer	547	" That was just what I forgot when ye came in , Mr. Balfour ! "
8860	8867	8868	8868	I	0	" Here are the two roads , "
8871	8967	8868	8868	I	0	" and both go to the same place . It s unjust that James should hang if I can save him ; and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing . It s lucky for James of the Glens that I have boasted beforehand ; and none so unlucky for myself , because now I m committed to do right . I have the name of a gentleman and the means of one ; it would be a poor duty that I was wanting in the essence . "
9210	9215	9201	9201	I	0	" There goes Davie . "
9430	9438	9439	9439	I	0	" Who are these two , mother ? "
9448	9456	9457	9457	she	626	" A blessing on your precious face ! "
9460	9478	9457	9457	she	626	" Twa joes 7 o mine : just two o my old joes , my hinny dear . "
9479	9486	9487	9487	I	0	" What did they suffer for ? "
9490	9499	9501	9501	she	626	" Ou , just for the guid cause , "
9503	9545	9501	9501	she	626	" Aften I spaed to them the way that it would end . Twa shillin Scots : no pickle mair ; and there are twa bonny callants hingin for t ! They took it frae a wean 8 belanged to Brouchton . "
9546	9549	9551	9551	I	0	" Ay ! "
9562	9584	9551	9551	I	0	" and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business ? This is to lose all indeed . "
9585	9594	9596	9596	she	626	" Gie s your loof , 9 hinny , "
9598	9608	9596	9596	she	626	" and let me spae your weird to ye . "
9609	9614	9616	9616	I	0	" No , mother , "
9618	9640	9616	9616	I	0	" I see far enough the way I am . It s an unco thing to see too far in front . "
9641	9649	9650	9650	she	626	" I read it in your bree , "
9653	9720	9650	9650	she	626	" There s a bonnie lassie that has bricht een , and there s a wee man in a braw coat , and a big man in a pouthered wig , and there s the shadow of the wuddy , 10 joe , that lies braid across your path . Gie s your loof , hinny , and let Auld Merren spae it to ye bonny . "
10099	10108	10110	10110	he	643	" And what is it , cousin David ! "
10111	10147	10110	10110	he	643	" since it appears that we are cousins what is this that I can do for you ! A word to Prestongrange ! Doubtless that is easily given . But what should be the word ? "
10148	10152	10154	10154	I	0	" Mr. Balfour , "
10156	10194	10154	10154	I	0	" if I were to tell you my whole story the way it fell out , it s my opinion and it was Rankeillor s before me that you would be very little made up with it . "
10195	10207	10209	10209	he	643	" I am sorry to hear this of you , kinsman , "
10211	10224	10226	10226	I	0	" I must not take that at your hands , Mr. Balfour , "
10228	10295	10296	10296	I	0	" I have nothing to my charge to make me sorry , or you for me , but just the common infirmities of mankind . The guilt of Adam s first sin , the want of original righteousness , and the corruption of my whole nature , so much I must answer for , and I hope I have been taught where to look for help , "
10322	10388	10296	10296	I	0	" But in the way of worldly honour I have no great stumble to reproach myself with ; and my difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and by all that I can see without my fault . My trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication , which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of . "
10389	10398	10399	10399	he	3029	" Why , very well , Mr. David , "
10402	10453	10455	10455	he	3029	" I am pleased to see you are all that Rankeillor represented . And for what you say of political complications , you do me no more than justice . It is my study to be beyond suspicion , and indeed outside the field of it . The question is , "
10457	10477	10455	10455	he	3029	" how , if I am to know nothing of the matter , I can very well assist you ? "
10478	10482	10484	10484	I	0	" Why sir , "
10486	10521	10484	10484	I	0	" I propose you should write to his lordship , that I am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means : both of which I believe to be the case . "
10522	10531	10533	10534	Mr. Balfour	222	" I have Rankeillor s word for it , "
10536	10549	10533	10534	Mr. Balfour	222	" and I count that a warran - dice against all deadly . "
10550	10582	10583	10583	I	0	" To which you might add if you will take my word for so much that I am a good churchman , loyal to King George , and so brought up , "
10587	10597	10599	10600	Mr. Balfour	222	" None of which will do you any harm , "
10602	10634	10635	10635	I	0	" Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of great moment , connected with His Majesty s service and the administration of justice , "
10638	10648	10650	10651	the laird	643	" As I am not to hear the matter , "
10653	10688	10650	10651	the laird	643	" I will not take upon myself to qualify its weight . Great moment therefore falls , and moment along with it . For the rest I might express myself much as you propose . "
10689	10695	10697	10697	I	0	" And then , sir , "
10709	10731	10697	10697	I	0	" then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection . "
10732	10735	10737	10737	he	643	" Protection ? "
10739	10774	10737	10737	he	643	" for your protection ! Here is a phrase that somewhat dampens me . If the matter be so dangerous , I own I would be a little loath to move in it blindfold . "
10775	10789	10791	10791	I.	0	" I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks , "
10792	10800	10802	10802	he	643	" Perhaps that would be the best , "
10804	10813	10737	10737	he	643	" Well , it s the Appin murder , "
10823	10828	10830	10830	he	643	" Sirs ! sirs ! "
10849	10856	10857	10857	I	0	" Let me explain . . . "
10860	10874	10876	10876	he	643	" I thank you kindly , I will hear no more of it , "
10878	10958	10876	10876	he	643	" I decline in toto to hear more of it . For your name s sake and Rankeillor s , and perhaps a little for your own , I will do what I can to help you ; but I will hear no more upon the facts . And it is my first clear duty to warn you . These are deep waters , Mr. David , and you are a young man . Be cautious and think twice . "
10959	10976	10978	10978	I	0	" It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that , Mr. Balfour , "
10980	11009	10978	10978	I	0	" and I will direct your attention again to Rankeillor s letter , where I hope and believe he has registered his approval of that which I design . "
11010	11015	11017	11017	he	650	" Well , well , "
11023	11037	11017	11017	he	650	" Well , well ! I will do what I can for you . "
11061	11074	11075	11075	he	650	" I understand that Rankeillor approved of what you have in mind ? "
11079	11097	11099	11099	I.	651	" After some discussion , sir , he bade me to go forward in God s name , "
11100	11109	11111	11112	Mr. Balfour	222	" That is the name to go in , "
11137	11144	11146	11146	he	650	" Now here , Mr. David , "
11148	11202	11121	11121	he	650	" is a letter of introduction , which I will seal without closing , and give into your hands open , as the form requires . But , since I am acting in the dark , I will just read it to you , so that you may see if it will secure your end
11203	11210	11121	11121	he	650	" Pilrig , August 26th , 1751 .
11211	11344	11121	11121	he	650	" My Lord , This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin , David Balfour Esquire of Shaws , a young gentleman of unblemished descent and good estate . He has enjoyed , besides , the more valuable advantages of a godly training , and his political principles are all that your lordship can desire . I am not in Mr. Balfour s confidence , but I understand him to have a matter to declare , touching His Majesty s service and the administration of justice ; purposes for which your Lordship s zeal is known . I should add that the young gentleman s intention is known to and approved by some of his friends , who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of his success or failure .
11345	11348	11350	11351	Mr. Balfour	180	" Whereupon , "
11353	11381	11350	11351	Mr. Balfour	180	" I have subscribed myself with the usual compliments . You observe I have said some of your friends ; I hope you can justify my plural ? "
11382	11398	11400	11400	I.	652	" Perfectly , sir ; my purpose is known and approved by more than one , "
11401	11423	11400	11400	I.	652	" And your letter , which I take a pleasure to thank you for , is all I could have hoped . "
11424	11433	11435	11435	he	180	" It was all I could squeeze out , "
11437	11463	11435	11435	he	180	" and from what I know of the matter you design to meddle in , I can only pray God that it may prove sufficient . "
11477	11485	11486	11486	he	653	" for the honour of the roof , "
11817	11822	11823	11823	he	665	" Is anybody there ? "
11826	11831	11823	11823	he	665	" Who in that ? "
11832	11849	11851	11851	I.	0	" I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord Advocate , "
11852	11859	11860	11860	he	665	" Have you been here long ? "
11863	11877	11879	11879	I.	0	" I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours , "
11880	11890	11891	11891	he	665	" It is the first I hear of it , "
11898	11920	11891	11891	he	665	" The lads must have forgotten you . But you are in the bit at last , for I am Prestongrange . "
12035	12044	12046	12046	he	3029	" Well , sir , sit ye down , "
12048	12057	12046	12046	he	3029	" and let us see Pilrig s letter . "
12130	12142	12143	12143	he	3029	" I am pleased to make your acquaintance , Mr. Balfour , "
12151	12161	12143	12143	he	3029	" Let me offer you a glass of claret . "
12162	12180	12182	12182	I.	0	" Under your favour , my lord , I think it would scarce be fair on me , "
12183	12222	12182	12182	I.	0	" I have come here , as the letter will have mentioned , on a business of some gravity to myself ; and , as I am little used with wine , I might be the sooner affected . "
12223	12230	12232	12232	he	3029	" You shall be the judge , "
12234	12252	12232	12232	he	3029	" But if you will permit , I believe I will even have the bottle in myself . "
12273	12283	12285	12286	the Advocate	2990	" You are sure you will not join me ? "
12288	12306	12285	12286	the Advocate	2990	" Well , here is to our better acquaintance ! In what way can I serve you ? "
12307	12331	12333	12333	I.	674	" I should , perhaps , begin by telling you , my lord , that I am here at your own pressing invitation , "
12334	12343	12345	12345	he	3029	" You have the advantage of me somewhere , "
12347	12362	12345	12345	he	3029	" for I profess I think I never heard of you before this evening . "
12363	12379	12381	12381	I.	674	" Right , my lord ; the name is , indeed , new to you , "
12382	12406	12381	12381	I.	674	" And yet you have been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance , and have declared the same in public . "
12407	12417	12419	12419	he	3029	" I wish you would afford me a clue , "
12421	12427	12419	12419	he	3029	" I am no Daniel . "
12428	12436	12438	12438	I	0	" It will perhaps serve for such , "
12440	12470	12438	12438	I	0	" that if I was in a jesting humour which is far from the case I believe I might lay a claim on your lordship for two hundred pounds . "
12471	12476	12477	12477	he	3029	" In what sense ? "
12480	12491	12438	12438	I	0	" In the sense of rewards offered for my person , "
12518	12525	12527	12527	he	3029	" What am I to understand ? "
12529	12538	12539	12539	I	0	" A tall strong lad of about eighteen , "
12542	12552	12539	12539	I	0	" speaks like a Lowlander and has no beard . "
12553	12559	12561	12561	he	3029	" I recognise those words , "
12563	12591	12561	12561	he	3029	" which , if you have come here with any ill - judged intention of amusing yourself , are like to prove extremely prejudicial to your safety . "
12592	12598	12599	12599	I	0	" My purpose in this , "
12602	12634	12599	12599	I	0	" is just entirely as serious as life and death , and you have understood me perfectly . I am the boy who was speaking with Glenure when he was shot . "
12635	12650	12652	12652	he	3029	" I can only suppose seeing you here that you claim to be innocent , "
12654	12660	12661	12661	I	0	" The inference is clear , "
12664	12698	12661	12661	I	0	" I am a very loyal subject to King George , but if I had anything to reproach myself with , I would have had more discretion than to walk into your den . "
12699	12706	12708	12708	he	3029	" I am glad of that , "
12710	12787	12708	12708	he	3029	" This horrid crime , Mr. Balfour , is of a dye which can not permit any clemency . Blood has been barbarously shed . It has been shed in direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole frame of laws , by those who are their known and public oppugnants . I take a very high sense of this . I will not deny that I consider the crime as directly personal to his Majesty . "
12788	12795	12796	12796	I	0	" And unfortunately , my lord , "
12803	12815	12796	12796	I	0	" directly personal to another great personage who may be nameless . "
12816	12855	12857	12857	he	675	" If you mean anything by those words , I must tell you I consider them unfit for a good subject ; and were they spoke publicly I should make it my business to take note of them , "
12859	12913	12857	12857	he	675	" You do not appear to me to recognise the gravity of your situation , or you would be more careful not to pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of justice . Justice , in this country , and in my poor hands , is no respecter of persons . "
12914	12930	12932	12932	I.	676	" You give me too great a share in my own speech , my lord , "
12933	12962	12932	12932	I.	676	" I did but repeat the common talk of the country , which I have heard everywhere , and from men of all opinions as I came along . "
12963	12988	12990	12991	the Advocate	2990	" When you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk in not to be listened to , how much less repeated , "
12993	13194	12990	12991	the Advocate	2990	" But I acquit you of an ill intention . That nobleman , whom we all honour , and who has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity , sits too high to be reached by these aspersions . The Duke of Argyle you see that I deal plainly with you takes it to heart as I do , and as we are both bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his Majesty ; and I could wish that all hands , in this ill age , were equally clean of family rancour . But from the accident that this is a Campbell who has fallen martyr to his duty as who else but the Campbells have ever put themselves foremost on that path ? I may say it , who am no Campbell and that the chief of that great house happens for all our advantages to be the present head of the College of Justice , small minds and disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the country ; and I find a young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill - advised as to make himself their echo . "
13221	13226	13228	13228	he	678	" All this apart , "
13230	13246	13228	13228	he	678	" It now remains that I should learn what I am to do with you . "
13247	13264	13266	13266	I.	680	" I had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your lordship , "
13267	13272	13274	13275	the Advocate	2990	" Ay , true , "
13277	13301	13303	13303	he	678	" But , you see , you come to me well recommended . There is a good honest Whig name to this letter , "
13314	13406	13303	13303	he	678	" And extra - judicially , Mr. Balfour there is always the possibility of some arrangement , I tell you , and I tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your guard , your fate lies with me singly . In such a matter be it said with reverence I am more powerful than the King s Majesty ; and should you please me and of course satisfy my conscience in what remains to be held of our interview , I tell you it may remain between ourselves . "
13407	13411	13412	13412	I	0	" Meaning how ? "
13415	13426	13428	13428	he	682	" Why , I mean it thus , Mr. Balfour , "
13430	13463	13428	13428	he	682	" that if you give satisfaction , no soul need know so much as that you visited my house ; and you may observe that I do not even call my clerk . "
13472	13486	13488	13488	I	0	" I suppose it is needless anyone should be informed upon my visit , "
13490	13515	13488	13488	I	0	" though the precise nature of my gains by that I can not see . I am not at all ashamed of coming here . "
13516	13524	13526	13526	he	682	" And have no cause to be , "
13530	13542	13526	13526	he	682	" Nor yet if you are careful to fear the consequences . "
13543	13547	13549	13549	I	0	" My lord , "
13551	13566	13549	13549	I	0	" speaking under your correction , I am not very easy to be frightened . "
13567	13580	13582	13582	he	682	" And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you , "
13584	13632	13582	13582	he	682	" But to the interrogation ; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the questions I shall ask you . It may consist very immediately with your safety . I have a great discretion , it is true , but there are bounds to it . "
13633	13644	13549	13549	I	0	" I shall try to follow your lordship s advice , "
13661	13685	13686	13686	he	682	" It appears you were present , by the way , in the wood of Lettermore at the moment of the fatal shot , "
13689	13695	13686	13686	he	682	" Was this by accident ? "
13696	13700	13702	13702	I.	0	" By accident , "
13703	13713	13714	13714	he	682	" How came you in speech with Colin Campbell ? "
13717	13728	13729	13729	I	0	" I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn , "
13742	13748	13750	13750	he	682	" H m , true , "
13752	13808	13750	13750	he	682	" I had forgotten that . And do you know , Mr. Balfour , I would dwell , if I were you , as little as might be on your relations with these Stewarts . It might be found to complicate our business . I am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential . "
13809	13830	13832	13832	I.	0	" I had thought , my lord , that all points of fact were equally material in such a case , "
13833	13843	13844	13844	he	682	" You forget we are now trying these Stewarts , "
13851	13910	13844	13844	he	682	" If we should ever come to be trying you , it will be very different ; and I shall press these very questions that I am now willing to glide upon . But to resume : I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell s precognition that you ran immediately up the brae . How came that ? "
13911	13928	13750	13750	he	682	" Not immediately , my lord , and the cause was my seeing of the murderer . "
13929	13936	13844	13844	he	682	" You saw him , then ? "
13937	13952	13750	13750	he	682	" As plain as I see your lordship , though not so near hand . "
13953	13958	13844	13844	he	682	" You know him ? "
13959	13966	13750	13750	he	682	" I should know him again . "
13967	13984	13844	13844	he	682	" In your pursuit you were not so fortunate , then , as to overtake him ? "
13985	13990	13750	13750	he	682	" I was not . "
13991	13996	13844	13844	he	682	" Was he alone ? "
13997	14002	13750	13750	he	682	" He was alone . "
14003	14013	13844	13844	he	682	" There was no one else in that neighbourhood ? "
14014	14030	13750	13750	he	682	" Alan Breck Stewart was not far off , in a piece of a wood . "
14038	14048	14050	14050	he	2990	" I think we are playing at cross purposes , "
14052	14066	14050	14050	he	2990	" which you will find to prove a very ill amusement for yourself . "
14067	14085	14087	14087	I.	684	" I content myself with following your lordship s advice , and answering what I am asked , "
14088	14099	14101	14101	he	2990	" Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time , "
14103	14134	14101	14101	he	2990	" I use you with the most anxious tenderness , which you scarce seem to appreciate , and which unless you be more careful may prove to be in vain . "
14135	14149	14150	14150	I	0	" I do appreciate your tenderness , but conceive it to be mistaken , "
14170	14198	14160	14160	I	0	" I am here to lay before you certain information , by which I shall convince you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of Glenure . "
14225	14229	14230	14230	he	2990	" Mr. Balfour , "
14235	14250	14230	14230	he	2990	" I tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests . "
14251	14255	14256	14256	I	0	" My lord , "
14259	14327	14256	14256	I	0	" I am as free of the charge of considering my own interests in this matter as your lordship . As God judges me , I have but the one design , and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go clear . If in pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship s displeasure , I must bear it as I may . "
14377	14401	14403	14403	he	687	" You are either very simple , or extremely the reverse , and I see that I must deal with you more confidentially , "
14405	14531	14403	14403	he	687	" This is a political case ah , yes , Mr. Balfour ! whether we like it or no , the case is political and I tremble when I think what issues may depend from it . To a political case , I need scarce tell a young man of your education , we approach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only . Salus populi suprema lex is a maxim susceptible of great abuse , but it has that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature : I mean it has the force of necessity . I will open this out to you , if you will allow me , at more length . You would have me believe "
14532	14554	14556	14556	I.	688	" Under your pardon , my lord , I would have you to believe nothing but that which I can prove , "
14557	14565	14567	14567	he	689	" Tut ! tut ; young gentleman , "
14569	14726	14567	14567	he	689	" be not so pragmatical , and suffer a man who might be your father if it was nothing more to employ his own imperfect language , and express his own poor thoughts , even when they have the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour s. You would have me to believe Breck innocent . I would think this of little account , the more so as we can not catch our man . But the matter of Breck s innocence shoots beyond itself . Once admitted , it would destroy the whole presumptions of our case against another and a very different criminal ; a man grown old in treason , already twice in arms against his king and already twice forgiven ; a fomentor of discontent , and whoever may have fired the shot the unmistakable original of the deed in question . I need not tell you that I mean James Stewart . "
14727	14769	14771	14771	I.	690	" And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James is what I am here to declare in private to your lordship , and what I am prepared to establish at the trial by my testimony , "
14772	14787	14789	14789	he	691	" To which I can only answer by an equal plainness , Mr. Balfour , "
14791	14814	14789	14789	he	691	" that in that case your testimony will not be called by me , and I desire you to withhold it altogether . "
14815	14827	14828	14828	I	0	" You are at the head of Justice in this country , "
14831	14840	14828	14828	I	0	" and you propose to me a crime ! "
14841	14856	14857	14857	he	691	" I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country , "
14860	14991	14857	14857	he	691	" and I press on you a political necessity . Patriotism is not always moral in the formal sense . You might be glad of it , I think : it is your own protection ; the facts are heavy against you ; and if I am still trying to except you from a very dangerous place , it is in part of course because I am not insensible to your honesty in coming here ; in part because of Pilrig s letter ; but in part , and in chief part , because I regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial duty only second . For the same reason I repeat it to you in the same frank words I do not want your testimony . "
14992	15015	15017	15017	I.	692	" I desire not to be thought to make a repartee , when I express only the plain sense of our position , "
15018	15043	15017	15017	I.	692	" But if your lordship has no need of my testimony , I believe the other side would be extremely blythe to get it . "
15057	15064	15065	15065	he	182	" You are not so young , "
15068	15410	15065	15065	he	182	" but what you must remember very clearly the year 45 and the shock that went about the country . I read in Pilrig s letter that you are sound in Kirk and State . Who saved them in that fatal year ? I do not refer to His Royal Highness and his ramrods , which were extremely useful in their day ; but the country had been saved and the field won before ever Cumberland came upon Drummossie . Who saved it ? I repeat ; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of our civil institutions ? The late Lord President Culloden , for one ; he played a man s part , and small thanks he got for it even as I , whom you see before you , straining every nerve in the same service , look for no reward beyond the conscience of my duties done . After the President , who else ? You know the answer as well as I do ; tis partly a scandal , and you glanced at it yourself , and I reproved you for it , when you first came in . It was the Duke and the great clan of Campbell . Now here is a Campbell foully murdered , and that in the King s service . The Duke and I are Highlanders . But we are Highlanders civilised , and it is not so with the great mass of our clans and families . They have still savage virtues and defects . They are still barbarians , like these Stewarts ; only the Campbells were barbarians on the right side , and the Stewarts were barbarians on the wrong . Now be you the judge . The Campbells expect vengeance . If they do not get it if this man James escape there will be trouble with the Campbells . That means disturbance in the Highlands , which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed : the disarming is a farce . . . "
15411	15420	15422	15422	I.	694	" I can bear you out in that , "
15423	15437	15439	15440	his lordship	3059	" Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful enemy , "
15450	15566	15447	15447	he	695	" and I give you my word we may have a 45 again with the Campbells on the other side . To protect the life of this man Stewart which is forfeit already on half - a - dozen different counts if not on this do you propose to plunge your country in war , to jeopardise the faith of your fathers , and to expose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent persons ? . . . These are considerations that weigh with me , and that I hope will weigh no less with yourself , Mr. Balfour , as a lover of your country , good government , and religious truth . "
15567	15582	15584	15584	I.	697	" You deal with me very frankly , and I thank you for it , "
15585	15750	15584	15584	I.	697	" I will try on my side to be no less honest . I believe your policy to be sound . I believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship ; I believe you may have laid them on your conscience when you took the oath of the high office which you hold . But for me , who am just a plain man or scarce a man yet the plain duties must suffice . I can think but of two things , of a poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death , and of the cries and tears of his wife that still tingle in my head . I can not see beyond , my lord . It s the way that I am made . If the country has to fall , it has to fall . And I pray God , if this be wilful blindness , that He may enlighten me before too late . "
15764	15771	15773	15773	he	698	" This is an unexpected obstacle , "
15781	15792	15793	15793	I	0	" And how is your lordship to dispose of me ? "
15796	15801	15803	15803	he	698	" If I wished , "
15805	15815	15803	15803	he	698	" you know that you might sleep in gaol ? "
15816	15820	15822	15822	I	0	" My lord , "
15824	15832	15822	15822	I	0	" I have slept in worse places . "
15833	15839	15841	15841	he	698	" Well , my boy , "
15843	15901	15841	15841	he	698	" there is one thing appears very plainly from our interview , that I may rely on your pledged word . Give me your honour that you will be wholly secret , not only on what has passed to - night , but in the matter of the Appin case , and I let you go free . "
15902	15923	15925	15925	I.	0	" I will give it till to - morrow or any other near day that you may please to set , "
15926	15951	15925	15925	I.	0	" I would not be thought too wily ; but if I gave the promise without qualification your lordship would have attained his end . "
15952	15961	15963	15963	he	698	" I had no thought to entrap you , "
15965	15972	15974	15974	I.	0	" I am sure of that , "
15975	15980	15981	15981	he	698	" Let me see , "
15984	16011	15981	15981	he	698	" To - morrow is the Sabbath . Come to me on Monday by eight in the morning , and give me your promise until then . "
16012	16019	16021	16021	I.	0	" Freely given , my lord , "
16022	16050	16021	16021	I.	0	" And with regard to what has fallen from yourself , I will give it for an long as it shall please God to spare your days . "
16051	16056	16057	16057	he	698	" You will observe , "
16061	16071	16057	16057	he	698	" that I have made no employment of menaces . "
16072	16081	16083	16083	I.	0	" It was like your lordship s nobility , "
16084	16106	16083	16083	I.	0	" Yet I am not altogether so dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you have not uttered . "
16107	16110	16112	16112	he	698	" Well , "
16114	16139	16112	16112	he	698	" good - night to you . May you sleep well , for I think it is more than I am like to do . "
16504	16514	16516	16516	I.	0	" Give you a good - morning , sir , "
16517	16528	16530	16530	he	181	" And a good - morning to you , sir , "
16532	16539	16540	16540	I	0	" You bide tryst with Prestongrange ? "
16543	16563	16565	16565	his	181	" I do , sir , and I pray your business with that gentleman be more agreeable than mine , "
16568	16587	16589	16589	I.	0	" I hope at least that yours will be brief , for I suppose you pass before me , "
16590	16596	16597	16597	he	181	" All pass before me , "
16612	16650	16597	16597	he	181	" It was not always so , sir , but times change . It was not so when the sword was in the scale , young gentleman , and the virtues of the soldier might sustain themselves . "
16668	16674	16676	16676	I	0	" Well , Mr. Macgregor , "
16678	16702	16676	16676	I	0	" I understand the main thing for a soldier is to be silent , and the first of his virtues never to complain . "
16703	16711	16712	16712	he	181	" You have my name , I perceive "
16720	16771	16717	16717	his	181	" though it s one I must not use myself . Well , there is a publicity I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards of my enemies . I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I know not . "
16772	16783	16785	16785	I	0	" That you know not in the least , sir , "
16787	16810	16785	16785	I	0	" nor yet anybody else ; but the name I am called , if you care to hear it , is Balfour . "
16811	16818	16819	16819	he	181	" It is a good name , "
16824	16862	16819	16819	he	181	" there are many decent folk that use it . And now that I call to mind , there was a young gentleman , your namesake , that marched surgeon in the year 45 with my battalion . "
16863	16876	16878	16878	I	0	" I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith , "
16889	16895	16897	16898	James More	181	" The same , sir , "
16900	16922	16897	16898	James More	181	" And since I have been fellow - soldier with your kinsman , you must suffer me to grasp your hand . "
16945	16948	16950	16950	he	181	" Ah ! "
16952	16970	16950	16950	he	181	" these are changed days since your cousin and I heard the balls whistle in our lugs . "
16971	16983	16985	16985	I	0	" I think he was a very far - away cousin , "
16989	17005	16985	16985	I	0	" and I ought to tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man . "
17006	17011	17013	17013	he	181	" Well , well , "
17015	17051	17013	17013	he	181	" it makes no change . And you I do not think you were out yourself , sir I have no clear mind of your face , which is one not probable to be forgotten . "
17052	17072	17074	17074	I.	0	" In the year you refer to , Mr. Macgregor , I was getting skelped in the parish school , "
17075	17079	17081	17081	he	181	" So young ! "
17083	17213	17214	17214	he	721	" Ah , then , you will never be able to think what this meeting is to me . In the hour of my adversity , and here in the house of my enemy , to meet in with the blood of an old brother - in - arms it heartens me , Mr. Balfour , like the skirling of the highland pipes ! Sir , this is a sad look back that many of us have to make : some with falling tears . I have lived in my own country like a king ; my sword , my mountains , and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me . Now I lie in a stinking dungeon ; and do you know , Mr. Balfour , "
17228	17335	17214	17214	he	721	" do you know , sir , that I lack mere necessaries ? The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my resources . I lie , as you know , sir , on a trumped - up charge , of which I am as innocent as yourself . They dare not bring me to my trial , and in the meanwhile I am held naked in my prison . I could have wished it was your cousin I had met , or his brother Baith himself . Either would , I know , have been rejoiced to help me ; while a comparative stranger like yourself "
17502	17510	17512	17512	he	182	" I have a moment s engagements , "
17514	17557	17512	17512	he	182	" and that you may not sit empty - handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters , of whom perhaps you may have heard , for I think they are more famous than papa . This way . "
17595	17605	17607	17607	he	182	" This is my new friend , Mr Balfour , "
17615	17651	17653	17653	he	182	" David , here is my sister , Miss Grant , who is so good as keep my house for me , and will be very pleased if she can help you . And here , "
17662	17705	17653	17653	he	182	" here are my three braw dauchters . A fair question to ye , Mr. Davie : which of the three is the best favoured ? And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound honest Alan Ramsay s answer ! "
18077	18086	18088	18088	she	744	" I never heard a note of it , "
18090	18101	18102	18102	she	744	" Whistle it all through . And now once again , "
18149	18167	18138	18138	she	744	" Haenae I got just the lilt of it ? Isnae this the tune that ye whustled ? "
18168	18172	18173	18173	she	744	" You see , "
18176	18193	18173	18173	she	744	" I can do the poetry too , only it won t rhyme . And then again :
18194	18214	18138	18138	she	744	" I am Miss Grant , sib to the Advocate : You , I believe , are Dauvit Balfour . "
18227	18238	18239	18239	she	744	" And what do you call the name of it ? "
18242	18251	18253	18253	I.	0	" I do not know the real name , "
18254	18263	18253	18253	I.	0	" I just call it Alan s air . "
18273	18282	18284	18284	she	744	" I shall call it David s air , "
18286	18350	18284	18284	she	744	" though if it s the least like what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it , for it s but melancholy music . Your other name I do not like ; so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine . "
18364	18371	18372	18372	I	0	" Why that , Miss Grant ? "
18375	18378	18380	18380	she	744	" Why , "
18382	18408	18380	18380	she	744	" if ever you should come to get hanged , I will set your last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it . "
18668	18673	18674	18676	The whole family	755	" Grey eyes again . "
18716	18722	18723	18723	they	755	" Come , Mr. Balfour , "
18726	18764	18723	18723	they	755	" come and see . She is the most beautiful creature ! She hangs round the close - head these last days , always with some wretched - like gillies , and yet seems quite a lady . "
18965	18969	18943	18944	the aunt	739	" papa s orders "
19008	19013	19015	19015	he	3356	" Now , girls , "
19017	19048	19015	19015	he	3356	" I must take Mr. Balfour away again ; but I hope you have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always gratified to find him . "
19276	19281	19283	19283	he	182	" Here , Fraser , "
19285	19328	19283	19283	he	182	" here is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about . Mr. David , this is Mr. Simon Fraser , whom we used to call by another title , but that is an old song . Mr. Fraser has an errand to you . "
19510	19516	19518	19518	he	182	" Well , Mr. Balfour , "
19520	19530	19518	19518	he	182	" what is all this I hear of ye ? "
19531	19540	19542	19542	I	0	" It would not become me to prejudge , "
19544	19560	19542	19542	I	0	" but if the Advocate was your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions . "
19561	19574	19575	19575	he	182	" I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case , "
19579	19634	19575	19575	he	182	" I am to appear under Prestongrange ; and from my study of the precognitions I can assure you your opinions are erroneous . The guilt of Breck is manifest ; and your testimony , in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the very moment , will certify his hanging . "
19635	19649	19650	19650	I	0	" It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him , "
19653	19668	19650	19650	I	0	" And for other matters I very willingly leave you to your own impressions . "
19669	19676	19677	19677	he	790	" The Duke has been informed , "
19681	19850	19677	19677	he	790	" I have just come from his Grace , and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the great nobleman he is . He spoke of you by name , Mr. Balfour , and declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand your own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself . Gratitude is no empty expression in that mouth : experto - crede . I daresay you know something of my name and clan , and the damnable example and lamented end of my late father , to say nothing of my own errata . Well , I have made my peace with that good Duke ; he has intervened for me with our friend Prestongrange ; and here I am with my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting King George s enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult to his Majesty . "
19851	19862	19650	19650	I	0	" Doubtless a proud position for your father s son , "
19873	19887	19889	19889	he	791	" You are pleased to make experiments in the ironical , I think , "
19891	19982	19889	19889	he	791	" But I am here upon duty , I am here to discharge my errand in good faith , it is in vain you think to divert me . And let me tell you , for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like yourself , a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years drudgery . The shove is now at your command ; choose what you will to be advanced in , the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate disposition of a father . "
19983	19996	19998	19998	I.	792	" I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son , "
19999	20035	20036	20036	he	793	" And do you really suppose , sir , that the whole policy of this country is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill - mannered colt of a boy ? "
20039	20104	20036	20036	he	793	" This has been made a test case , all who would prosper in the future must put a shoulder to the wheel . Look at me ! Do you suppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly invidious position of persecuting a man that I have drawn the sword alongside of ? The choice is not left me . "
20105	20126	20127	20127	I	0	" But I think , sir , that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with that unnatural rebellion , "
20130	20158	20127	20127	I	0	" My case is happily otherwise ; I am a true man , and can look either the Duke or King George in the face without concern . "
20159	20167	20169	20169	he	794	" Is it so the wind sits ? "
20171	20230	20169	20169	he	794	" I protest you are fallen in the worst sort of error . Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil he tells me as not to combat your allegations ; but you must not think they are not looked upon with strong suspicion . You say you are innocent . My dear sir , the facts declare you guilty . "
20231	20239	20241	20241	I.	795	" I was waiting for you there , "
20242	20268	20270	20271	Mr. Simon	240	" The evidence of Mungo Campbell ; your flight after the completion of the murder ; your long course of secresy my good young man ! "
20273	20336	20338	20338	he	240	" here is enough evidence to hang a bullock , let be a David Balfour ! I shall be upon that trial ; my voice shall be raised ; I shall then speak much otherwise from what I do to - day , and far less to your gratification , little as you like it now ! Ah , you look white ! "
20340	20376	20338	20338	he	240	" I have found the key of your impudent heart . You look pale , your eyes waver , Mr. David ! You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had fancied . "
20377	20385	20387	20387	I.	796	" I own to a natural weakness , "
20388	20400	20387	20387	I.	796	" I think no shame for that . Shame . . . "
20406	20415	20416	20416	he	240	" Shame waits for you on the gibbet , "
20420	20434	20436	20436	I.	796	" Where I shall but be even d with my lord your father , "
20437	20444	20445	20445	he	240	" Aha , but not so ! "
20448	20629	20445	20445	he	240	" and you do not yet see to the bottom of this business . My father suffered in a great cause , and for dealing in the affairs of kings . You are to hang for a dirty murder about boddle - pieces . Your personal part in it , the treacherous one of holding the poor wretch in talk , your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland gillies . And it can be shown , my great Mr. Balfour it can be shown , and it will be shown , trust me that has a finger in the pie it can be shown , and shall be shown , that you were paid to do it . I think I can see the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence , and it shall appear that you , a young man of education , let yourself be corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast clothes , a bottle of Highland spirits , and three - and - fivepence - halfpenny in copper money . "
20697	20707	20708	20708	he	181	" You see I know more than you fancied , "
20713	20855	20856	20856	he	800	" And as for giving it this turn , great Mr. David , you must not suppose the Government of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of evidence . We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as we direct them ; as I direct , if you prefer the phrase . So now you are to guess your part of glory if you choose to die . On the one hand , life , wine , women , and a duke to be your handgun : on the other , a rope to your craig , and a gibbet to clatter your bones on , and the lousiest , lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told about a hired assassin . And see here ! "
20865	20951	20856	20856	he	800	" see this paper that I pull out of my pocket . Look at the name there : it is the name of the great David , I believe , the ink scarce dry yet . Can you guess its nature ? It is the warrant for your arrest , which I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the spot . Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper , may God help you , for the die is cast ! "
21008	21017	21019	21019	I.	0	" There is a gentleman in this room , "
21020	21036	21019	21019	I.	0	" I appeal to him . I put my life and credit in his hands . "
21045	21053	21055	21055	he	182	" I told you so , Simon , "
21057	21077	21078	21078	he	182	" you have played your hand for all it was worth , and you have lost . Mr. David , "
21082	21196	21198	21198	he	801	" I wish you to believe it was by no choice of mine you were subjected to this proof . I wish you could understand how glad I am you should come forth from it with so much credit . You may not quite see how , but it is a little of a service to myself . For had our friend here been more successful than I was last night , it might have appeared that he was a better judge of men than I ; it might have appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations , Mr. Simon and myself . And I know our friend Simon to be ambitious , "
21207	21255	21198	21198	he	801	" As for this stage play , it is over ; my sentiments are very much engaged in your behalf ; and whatever issue we can find to this unfortunate affair , I shall make it my business to see it is adopted with tenderness to you . "
21390	21401	21377	21377	I	0	" I put my life and credit in your hands . "
21402	21407	21409	21409	he	804	" Well , well , "
21411	21573	21409	21409	he	804	" we must try to save them . And in the meanwhile let us return to gentler methods . You must not bear any grudge upon my friend , Mr. Simon , who did but speak by his brief . And even if you did conceive some malice against myself , who stood by and seemed rather to hold a candle , I must not let that extend to innocent members of my family . These are greatly engaged to see more of you , and I can not consent to have my young womenfolk disappointed . To - morrow they will be going to Hope Park , where I think it very proper you should make your bow . Call for me first , when I may possibly have something for your private hearing ; then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses ; and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy . "
21829	21833	21835	21836	the one	3002	" Ha e , "
21838	21851	21835	21836	the one	3002	" this billet as fast as ye can link to the captain . "
21852	21861	21863	21864	the other	3003	" Is that for the cateran back again ? "
21866	21872	21874	21875	the first	814	" It would seem sae , "
21877	21885	21874	21875	the first	814	" Him and Simon are seeking him . "
21886	21894	21896	21897	the second	815	" I think Prestongrange is gane gyte , "
21899	21911	21896	21897	the second	815	" He ll have James More in bed with him next . "
21912	21924	21926	21927	the first	814	" Weel , it s neither your affair nor mine s , "
22915	22923	22924	22924	she	862	" What do ye come seeking here ? "
22936	22947	22949	22949	she	862	" And what may be your business with Miss Drummond ? "
22985	22993	22994	22994	she	862	" O , so you re Saxpence ! "
23003	23027	23028	23028	she	862	" A braw gift , a bonny gentleman . And hae ye ony ither name and designation , or were ye bapteesed Saxpence ? "
23036	23040	23041	23041	she	862	" Preserve me ! "
23044	23051	23041	23041	she	862	" Has Ebenezer gotten a son ? "
23052	23058	23060	23060	I.	0	" No , ma am , "
23061	23079	23060	23060	I.	0	" I am a son of Alexander s. It s I that am the Laird of Shaws . "
23080	23094	23041	23041	she	862	" Ye ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that , "
23098	23106	23108	23108	I	0	" I perceive you know my uncle , "
23110	23127	23108	23108	I	0	" and I daresay you may be the better pleased to hear that business is arranged . "
23128	23138	23139	23139	she	862	" And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond ? "
23142	23152	23154	23154	I.	0	" I m come after my saxpence , mem , "
23155	23176	23154	23154	I.	0	" It s to be thought , being my uncle s nephew , I would be found a careful lad . "
23177	23188	23190	23192	the old lady	864	" So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye ? "
23198	23221	23190	23192	the old lady	864	" I thought ye had just been a cuif you and your saxpence , and your lucky day and your sake of Balwhidder "
23239	23248	23249	23249	she	864	" But all this is by the purpose , "
23252	23264	23249	23249	she	864	" Am I to understand that ye come here keeping company ? "
23265	23274	23276	23276	I.	0	" This is surely rather an early question , "
23277	23303	23304	23304	I	0	" The maid is young , so am I , worse fortune . I have but seen her the once . I ll not deny , "
23318	23367	23304	23304	I	0	" I ll not deny but she has run in my head a good deal since I met in with her . That is one thing ; but it would be quite another , and I think I would look very like a fool , to commit myself . "
23368	23380	23382	23384	the old lady	864	" You can speak out of your mouth , I see , "
23386	23486	23487	23487	she	864	" Praise God , and so can I ! I was fool enough to take charge of this rogue s daughter : a fine charge I have gotten ; but it s mine , and I ll carry it the way I want to . Do ye mean to tell me , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , that you would marry James More s daughter , and him hanged ! Well , then , where there s no possible marriage there shall be no manner of carryings on , and take that for said . Lasses are bruckle things , "
23494	23518	23487	23487	she	864	" and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled chafts , I was a lassie mysel , and a bonny one . "
23519	23523	23525	23525	I	0	" Lady Allardyce , "
23527	23697	23525	23525	I	0	" for that I suppose to be your name , you seem to do the two sides of the talking , which is a very poor manner to come to an agreement . You give me rather a home thrust when you ask if I would marry , at the gallow s foot , a young lady whom I have seen but once . I have told you already I would never be so untenty as to commit myself . And yet I ll go some way with you . If I continue to like the lass as well as I have reason to expect , it will be something more than her father , or the gallows either , that keeps the two of us apart . As for my family , I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee ! I owe less than nothing to my uncle and if ever I marry , it will be to please one person : that s myself . "
23698	23711	23713	23714	Mrs. Ogilvy	196	" I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born , "
23716	23917	23713	23714	Mrs. Ogilvy	196	" which is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little . There s much to be considered . This James More is a kinsman of mine , to my shame be it spoken . But the better the family , the mair men hanged or headed , that s always been poor Scotland s story . And if it was just the hanging ! For my part I think I would be best pleased with James upon the gallows , which would be at least an end to him . Catrine s a good lass enough , and a good - hearted , and lets herself be deaved all day with a runt of an auld wife like me . But , ye see , there s the weak bit . She s daft about that long , false , fleeching beggar of a father of hers , and red - mad about the Gregara , and proscribed names , and King James , and a wheen blethers . And you might think ye could guide her , ye would find yourself sore mista en . Ye say ye ve seen her but the once . . . "
23918	23931	23932	23932	I	0	" Spoke with her but the once , I should have said , "
23935	23948	23932	23932	I	0	" I saw her again this morning from a window at Prestongrange s. "
23972	23979	23981	23983	the old lady	864	" What s this of it ? "
23993	24011	23990	23990	her	864	" I think it was at the Advocate s door - cheek that ye met her first . "
24019	24023	24024	24024	she	864	" H m , "
24037	24046	24047	24047	she	864	" I have your bare word for it , "
24050	24211	24213	24213	she	868	" as to who and what you are . By your way of it , you re Balfour of the Shaws ; but for what I ken you may be Balfour of the Deevil s oxter . It s possible ye may come here for what ye say , and it s equally possible ye may come here for deil care what ! I m good enough Whig to sit quiet , and to have keepit all my men - folk s heads upon their shoulders . But I m not just a good enough Whig to be made a fool of neither . And I tell you fairly , there s too much Advocate s door and Advocate s window here for a man that comes taigling after a Macgregor s daughter . Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent ye , with my fond love . And I kiss my loof to ye , Mr. Balfour , "
24222	24236	24213	24213	she	868	" and a braw journey to ye back to where ye cam frae . "
24237	24245	24246	24246	I	0	" If you think me a spy , "
24276	24288	24289	24289	she	868	" Here ! Hoots ! The callant s in a creel ! "
24292	24346	24347	24347	she	868	" Think ye a spy ? what else would I think ye me that kens naething by ye ? But I see that I was wrong ; and as I can not fight , I ll have to apologise . A bonny figure I would be with a broadsword . Ay ! ay ! "
24351	24460	24347	24347	she	868	" you re none such a bad lad in your way ; I think ye ll have some redeeming vices . But , O ! Davit Balfour , ye re damned countryfeed . Ye ll have to win over that , lad ; ye ll have to soople your back - bone , and think a wee pickle less of your dainty self ; and ye ll have to try to find out that women - folk are nae grenadiers . But that can never be . To your last day you ll ken no more of women - folk than what I do of sow - gelding . "
24522	24526	24527	24527	she	196	" Keep me ! "
24535	24581	24582	24582	she	196	" you have the finest timber face and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland cateran ! Davie , my dear , I think we ll have to make a match of it if it was just to see the weans . And now , "
24586	24658	24659	24659	she	196	" there s no manner of service in your daidling here , for the young woman is from home , and it s my fear that the old woman is no suitable companion for your father s son . Forbye that I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation , and have been long enough alone with a sedooctive youth . And come back another day for your saxpence ! "
25094	25097	25098	25098	she	888	" O ! "
25101	25114	25098	25098	she	888	" you have been seeking your sixpence ; did you get it ? "
25134	25145	25147	25147	I	0	" Though I have seen you to - day already , "
25156	25163	25164	25164	she	888	" I did not see you , "
25167	25191	25164	25164	she	888	" My eyes are big , but there are better than mine at seeing far . Only I heard singing in the house . "
25192	25198	25200	25200	I	0	" That was Miss Grant , "
25202	25209	25200	25200	I	0	" the eldest and the bonniest . "
25210	25218	25220	25220	she	888	" They say they are all beautiful , "
25222	25233	25234	25234	I	0	" They think the same of you , Miss Drummond , "
25237	25249	25234	25234	I	0	" and were all crowding to the window to observe you . "
25250	25261	25263	25263	she	888	" It is a pity about my being so blind , "
25265	25298	25263	25263	she	888	" or I might have seen them too . And you were in the house ? You must have been having the fine time with the fine music and the pretty ladies . "
25299	25308	25310	25310	I	0	" There is just where you are wrong , "
25312	25348	25310	25310	I	0	" for I was as uncouth as a sea - fish upon the brae of a mountain . The truth is that I am better fitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies . "
25349	25362	25364	25364	she	888	" Well , I would think so too , at all events ! "
25374	25383	25385	25385	I.	0	" It is a strange thing , now , "
25386	25415	25385	25385	I.	0	" I am not the least afraid with you , yet I could have run from the Miss Grants . And I was afraid of your cousin too . "
25416	25429	25430	25430	she	888	" O , I think any man will be afraid of her , "
25433	25442	25430	25430	she	888	" My father is afraid of her himself . "
25499	25504	25506	25506	I	0	" Speaking of which , "
25508	25519	25506	25506	I	0	" I met your father no later than this morning . "
25520	25524	25525	25525	she	888	" Did you ? "
25540	25554	25525	25525	she	888	" You saw James More ? You will have spoken with him then ? "
25555	25561	25563	25563	I.	0	" I did even that , "
25588	25596	25598	25598	she	888	" Ah , thank you for that ! "
25600	25608	25610	25610	I	0	" You thank me for very little , "
25635	25643	25645	25645	I	0	" I spoke rather ill to him , "
25647	25667	25645	25645	I	0	" I did no like him very much ; I spoke him rather ill , and he was angry . "
25668	25687	25688	25688	she	888	" I think you had little to do then , and less to tell it to his daughter ! "
25692	25707	25688	25688	she	888	" But those that do not love and cherish him I will not know . "
25708	25719	25721	25721	I	0	" I will take the freedom of a word yet , "
25727	25801	25721	25721	I	0	" Perhaps neither your father nor I are in the best of spirits at Prestongrange s. I daresay we both have anxious business there , for it s a dangerous house . I was sorry for him too , and spoke to him the first , if I could but have spoken the wiser . And for one thing , in my opinion , you will soon find that his affairs are mending . "
25802	25815	25817	25817	she	896	" It will not be through your friendship , I am thinking , "
25819	25832	25817	25817	she	896	" and he is much made up to you for your sorrow . "
25833	25837	25839	25839	I	0	" Miss Drummond , "
25841	25849	25839	25839	I	0	" I am alone in this world . "
25850	25859	25861	25861	she	896	" And I am not wondering at that , "
25863	25870	25872	25872	I.	0	" O , let me speak ! "
25873	25968	25872	25872	I.	0	" I will speak but the once , and then leave you , if you will , for ever . I came this day in the hopes of a kind word that I am sore in want of . I know that what I said must hurt you , and I knew it then . It would have been easy to have spoken smooth , easy to lie to you ; can you not think how I was tempted to the same ? Can not you see the truth of my heart shine out ? "
25969	25983	25985	25985	she	896	" I think here is a great deal of work , Mr. Balfour , "
25987	26006	25985	25985	she	896	" I think we will have met but the once , and will can part like gentle folk . "
26007	26019	26020	26020	I	0	" O , let me have one to believe in me ! "
26023	26078	26020	26020	I	0	" I cannae bear it else . The whole world is clanned against me . How am I to go through with my dreadful fate ? If there s to be none to believe in me I can not do it . The man must just die , for I can not do it . "
26109	26116	26117	26117	she	896	" What is this you say ? "
26120	26127	26117	26117	she	896	" What are you talking of ? "
26128	26140	26142	26142	I	0	" It is my testimony which may save an innocent life , "
26144	26339	26142	26142	I	0	" and they will not suffer me to bear it . What would you do yourself ? You know what this is , whose father lies in danger . Would you desert the poor soul ? They have tried all ways with me . They have sought to bribe me ; they offered me hills and valleys . And to - day that sleuth - hound told me how I stood , and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace me . I am to be brought in a party to the murder ; I am to have held Glenure in talk for money and old clothes ; I am to be killed and shamed . If this is the way I am to fall , and me scarce a man if this is the story to be told of me in all Scotland if you are to believe it too , and my name is to be nothing but a by - word Catriona , how can I go through with it ? The thing s not possible ; it s more than a man has in his heart . "
26369	26378	26379	26379	she	897	" Glenure ! It is the Appin murder , "
26428	26434	26435	26435	I	0	" For God s sake ! "
26438	26452	26435	26435	I	0	" for God s sake , what is this that I have done ? "
26461	26478	26435	26435	I	0	" What made me do it ? Sure , I am bewitched to say these things ! "
26479	26491	26492	26492	she	897	" In the name of heaven , what ails you now ! "
26495	26501	26502	26502	I	0	" I gave my honour , "
26505	26521	26502	26502	I	0	" I gave my honour and now I have broke it . O , Catriona ! "
26522	26531	26532	26532	she	897	" I am asking you what it is , "
26535	26579	26532	26532	she	897	" was it these things you should not have spoken ? And do you think I have no honour , then ? or that I am one that would betray a friend ? I hold up my right hand to you and swear . "
26580	26590	26592	26592	I.	0	" O , I knew you would be true ! "
26593	26692	26592	26592	I.	0	" It s me it s here . I that stood but this morning and out - faced them , that risked rather to die disgraced upon the gallows than do wrong and a few hours after I throw my honour away by the roadside in common talk ! There is one thing clear upon our interview , says he , that I can rely on your pledged word . Where is my word now ? Who could believe me now ? You could not believe me . I am clean fallen down ; I had best die ! "
26711	26719	26721	26721	she	900	" My heart is sore for you , "
26723	26847	26721	26721	she	900	" but be sure you are too nice . I would not believe you , do you say ? I would trust you with anything . And these men ? I would not be thinking of them ! Men who go about to entrap and to destroy you ! Fy ! this is no time to crouch . Look up ! Do you not think I will be admiring you like a great hero of the good and you a boy not much older than myself ? And because you said a word too much in a friend s ear , that would die ere she betrayed you to make such a matter ! It is one thing that we must both forget . "
26848	26851	26853	26853	I	0	" Catriona , "
26863	26876	26853	26853	I	0	" is this true of it ? Would ye trust me yet ? "
26877	26888	26889	26889	she	901	" Will you not believe the tears upon my face ? "
26892	26942	26889	26889	she	901	" It is the world I am thinking of you , Mr. David Balfour . Let them hang you ; I will never forget , I will grow old and still remember you . I think it is great to die so : I will envy you that gallows . "
26943	26958	26960	26960	I.	902	" And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles , "
26961	26971	26960	26960	I.	902	" Maybe they but make a mock of me . "
26972	26980	26981	26981	she	901	" It is what I must know , "
26984	27006	26981	26981	she	901	" I must hear the whole . The harm is done at all events , and I must hear the whole . "
27048	27051	27052	27052	she	901	" Well , "
27060	27113	27052	27052	she	901	" you are a hero , surely , and I never would have thought that same ! And I think you are in peril , too . O , Simon Fraser ! to think upon that man ! For his life and the dirty money , to be dealing in such traffic ! "
27142	27146	27148	27148	she	901	" My torture ! "
27150	27156	27148	27148	she	901	" look at the sun ! "
27288	27291	27293	27293	Prestongrange	182	" Aha , "
27295	27352	27293	27293	Prestongrange	182	" you are very fine to - day ; my misses are to have a fine cavalier . Come , I take that kind of you . I take that kind of you , Mr. David . O , we shall do very well yet , and I believe your troubles are nearly at an end . "
27353	27360	27362	27362	I.	0	" You have news for me ? "
27363	27367	27368	27368	he	182	" Beyond anticipation , "
27371	27410	27368	27368	he	182	" Your testimony is after all to be received ; and you may go , if you will , in my company to the trial , which in to be held at Inverary , Thursday , 21st proximo . "
27420	27425	27426	27426	he	182	" In the meanwhile , "
27429	27477	27426	27426	he	182	" though I will not ask you to renew your pledge , I must caution you strictly to be reticent . To - morrow your precognition must be taken ; and outside of that , do you know , I think least said will be soonest mended . "
27478	27486	27488	27488	I.	0	" I shall try to go discreetly , "
27489	27539	27488	27488	I.	0	" I believe it is yourself that I must thank for this crowning mercy , and I do thank you gratefully . After yesterday , my lord , this is like the doors of Heaven . I can not find it in my heart to get the thing believed . "
27540	27559	27561	27561	he	910	" Ah , but you must try and manage , you must try and manage to believe it , "
27567	27592	27593	27593	he	910	" and I am very glad to hear your acknowledgment of obligation , for I think you may be able to repay me very shortly "
27595	27649	27593	27593	he	910	" or even now . The matter is much changed . Your testimony , which I shall not trouble you for to - day , will doubtless alter the complexion of the case for all concerned , and this makes it less delicate for me to enter with you on a side issue . "
27650	27654	27655	27655	I	0	" My Lord , "
27658	27696	27655	27655	I	0	" excuse me for interrupting you , but how has this been brought about ? The obstacles you told me of on Saturday appeared even to me to be quite insurmountable ; how has it been contrived ? "
27697	27703	27705	27705	he	910	" My dear Mr. David , "
27707	27744	27705	27705	he	910	" it would never do for me to divulge even to you , as you say the councils of the Government ; and you must content yourself , if you please , with the gross fact . "
27820	27831	27832	27832	he	910	" There is a point I wish to touch upon , "
27835	27893	27832	27832	he	910	" I purposely left it before upon one side , which need be now no longer necessary . This is not , of course , a part of your examination , which is to follow by another hand ; this is a private interest of my own . You say you encountered Alan Breck upon the hill ? "
27894	27901	27903	27903	I.	0	" I did , my lord , "
27904	27912	27832	27832	he	910	" This was immediately after the murder ? "
27913	27917	27832	27832	he	910	" It was . "
27918	27925	27832	27832	he	910	" Did you speak to him ? "
27926	27930	27832	27832	he	910	" I did . "
27931	27941	27943	27944	my lord	3161	" You had known him before , I think ? "
27948	27962	27963	27963	I	0	" I can not guess your reason for so thinking , my lord , "
27966	27973	27963	27963	I	0	" but such in the fact . "
27974	27984	27986	27986	he	3161	" And when did you part with him again ? "
27988	27994	27996	27996	I.	0	" I reserve my answer , "
27997	28009	27996	27996	I.	0	" The question will be put to me at the assize . "
28010	28014	28016	28016	he	3161	" Mr. Balfour , "
28018	28128	28016	28016	he	3161	" will you not understand that all this is without prejudice to yourself ? I have promised you life and honour ; and , believe me , I can keep my word . You are therefore clear of all anxiety . Alan , it appears , you suppose you can protect ; and you talk to me of your gratitude , which I think if you push me is not ill - deserved . There are a great many different considerations all pointing the same way ; and I will never be persuaded that you could not help us if you chose to put salt on Alan s tail . "
28129	28133	28135	28135	I	0	" My lord , "
28137	28154	28135	28135	I	0	" I give you my word I do not so much as guess where Alan is . "
28160	28168	28169	28169	he	914	" Nor how he might be found ? "
28182	28193	28194	28194	he	914	" And so much for your gratitude , Mr. David ! "
28205	28208	28210	28210	he	914	" Well , "
28214	28279	28210	28210	he	914	" I am not fortunate , and we are a couple at cross purposes . Let us speak of it no more ; you will receive notice when , where , and by whom , we are to take your precognition . And in the meantime , my misses must be waiting you . They will never forgive me if I detain their cavalier . "
28741	28744	28728	28733	a gawky , leering Highland boy	943	" Palfour . "
28762	28767	28769	28769	he	941	" Ha , Palfour , "
28777	28782	28769	28769	he	941	" Palfour , Palfour ! "
28783	28796	28798	28798	I	0	" I am afraid you do not like my name , sir , "
28812	28815	28817	28817	he	941	" No , "
28819	28825	28817	28817	he	941	" but I wass thinking . "
28826	28841	28843	28843	I.	0	" I would not advise you to make a practice of that , sir , "
28844	28858	28843	28843	I.	0	" I feel sure you would not find it to agree with you . "
28859	28871	28873	28873	he	941	" Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs ? "
28923	28934	28936	28936	I	0	" Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen , "
28938	28949	28936	28936	I	0	" I think I would learn the English language first . "
28990	28997	28999	28999	he	941	" You tam lowland scoon rel ! "
29040	29046	29048	29048	he	941	" Enough plows I think , "
29050	29112	29048	29048	he	941	" I will be the offended shentleman , for who effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is the king s officer he cannae speak Cot s English ? We have swords at our hurdles , and here is the King s Park at hand . Will ye walk first , or let me show ye the way ? "
29547	29553	29555	29556	the lieutenant	960	" Fat deil ails her ? "
29627	29635	29636	29636	he	960	" Pe tamned if I touch you ! "

29713	29720	29722	29722	he	960	" And that is the truth , "
29724	29815	29722	29722	he	960	" I am fery prave myself , and pold as a lions . But to stand up there and you ken naething of fence ! the way that you did , I declare it was peyond me . And I am sorry for the plow ; though I declare I pelief your own was the elder brother , and my heid still sings with it . And I declare if I had kent what way it wass , I would not put a hand to such a piece of pusiness . "
29816	29822	29823	29823	I	0	" That is handsomely said , "
29826	29848	29823	29823	I	0	" and I am sure you will not stand up a second time to be the actor for my private enemies . "
29849	29856	29858	29858	he	963	" Indeed , no , Palfour , "
29860	29907	29858	29858	he	963	" and I think I was used extremely suffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife , or all the same as a bairn whateffer ! And I will tell the Master so , and fecht him , by Cot , himself ! "
29908	29923	29925	29925	I	0	" And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon s quarrel with me , "
29927	29943	29925	29925	I	0	" you would be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such affairs . "
30022	30036	30038	30038	I	0	" You can do me a better service than even what you propose , "
30047	30070	30071	30071	I	0	" Come with me to the house of one of my enemies , and testify how I have carried myself this day , "
30075	30144	30071	30071	I	0	" That will be the true service . For though he has sent me a gallant adversary for the first , the thought in Mr. Simon s mind is merely murder . There will be a second and then a third ; and by what you have seen of my cleverness with the cold steel , you can judge for yourself what is like to be the upshot . "
30145	30167	30168	30168	he	963	" And I would not like it myself , if I was no more of a man than what you wass ! "
30171	30184	30168	30168	he	963	" But I will do you right , Palfour . Lead on ! "
30232	30241	30207	30207	They	969	" Surely the bitterness of death is passed . "
30333	30348	30350	30350	I.	0	" My business is but for three minutes , and it can not wait , "
30351	30373	30350	30350	I.	0	" You may say it is by no means private , and I shall be even glad to have some witnesses . "
30470	30494	30496	30496	Prestongrange	182	" Well , well , Mr. Balfour , and what brings you here again ? and who is this you bring with you ? "
30510	30536	30538	30538	I	0	" He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour , my lord , which I think it very needful you should hear , "
30545	30553	30555	30556	the lieutenant	960	" I have only to say this , "
30558	30602	30603	30603	he	960	" that I stood up this day with Palfour in the Hunter s Pog , which I am now fery sorry for , and he behaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it . And I have creat respects for Palfour , "
30606	30615	30617	30617	I.	0	" I thank you for your honest expressions , "
30639	30648	30650	30650	Prestongrange	182	" What have I to do with this ? "
30652	30662	30664	30664	I.	0	" I will tell your lordship in two words , "
30665	30735	30664	30664	I.	0	" I have brought this gentleman , a King s officer , to do me so much justice . Now I think my character is covered , and until a certain date , which your lordship can very well supply , it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any more officers . I will not consent to fight my way through the garrison of the castle . "
30751	30766	30767	30767	he	182	" I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs ! "
30779	30789	30790	30790	he	182	" This is some of your work , Simon , "
30793	30874	30790	30790	he	182	" I spy your hand in the business , and , let me tell you , I resent it . It is disloyal , when we are agreed upon one expedient , to follow another in the dark . You are disloyal to me . What ! you let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters ! And because I let drop a word to you ..... Fy , sir , keep your dishonours to yourself ! "
30880	30896	30897	30897	he	240	" I will be a kick - ball between you and the Duke no longer , "
30900	30963	30897	30897	he	240	" Either come to an agreement , or come to a differ , and have it out among yourselves . But I will no longer fetch and carry , and get your contrary instructions , and be blamed by both . For if I were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover business it would make your head sing . "
30977	30983	30985	30985	he	261	" And in the meantime , "
30987	31031	30985	30985	he	261	" I think we should tell Mr. Balfour that his character for valour is quite established . He may sleep in peace . Until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall be put to the proof no more . "
31442	31452	31454	31454	he	199	" We ll have to sit upon the floor , "
31456	31479	31454	31454	he	199	" but we re safe here for the time being , and I ve been wearying to see ye , Mr. Balfour . "
31480	31487	31488	31488	I	0	" How s it with Alan ? "
31491	31494	31496	31496	he	199	" Brawly , "
31498	31557	31496	31496	he	199	" Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to - morrow , Wednesday . He was keen to say good - bye to ye , but the way that things were going , I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart . And that brings me to the essential : how does your business speed ? "
31558	31561	31563	31563	I	0	" Why , "
31565	31592	31563	31563	I	0	" I was told only this morning that my testimony was accepted , and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate , no less . "
31593	31597	31599	31599	Stewart	199	" Hout awa ! "
31601	31608	31599	31599	Stewart	199	" I ll never believe that . "
31609	31619	31621	31621	I	0	" I have maybe a suspicion of my own , "
31623	31634	31621	31621	I	0	" but I would like fine to hear your reasons . "
31635	31649	31651	31651	Stewart	199	" Well , I tell ye fairly , I m horn - mad , "
31653	31767	31651	31651	Stewart	199	" If my one hand could pull their Government down I would pluck it like a rotten apple . I m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens ; and , of course , it s my duty to defend my kinsman for his life . Hear how it goes with me , and I ll leave the judgment of it to yourself . The first thing they have to do is to get rid of Alan . They cannae bring in James as art and part until they ve brought in Alan first as principal ; that s sound law : they could never put the cart before the horse . "
31768	31783	31785	31785	I.	1017	" And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him ? "
31786	31799	31801	31801	he	1017	" Ah , but there is a way to evite that arrestment , "
31803	32085	31801	31801	he	1017	" Sound law , too . It would be a bonny thing if , by the escape of one ill - doer another was to go scatheless , and the remeid is to summon the principal and put him to outlawry for the non - compearance . Now there s four places where a person can be summoned : at his dwelling - house ; at a place where he has resided forty days ; at the head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily resorts ; or lastly if there be ground to think him forth of Scotland at the cross of Edinburgh , and the pier and shore of Leith , for sixty days . The purpose of which last provision is evident upon its face : being that outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the transaction , and the summonsing be something other than a form . Now take the case of Alan . He has no dwelling - house that ever I could hear of ; I would be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty days together since the 45 ; there is no shire where he resorts whether ordinarily or extraordinarily ; if he has a domicile at all , which I misdoubt , it must be with his regiment in France ; and if he is not yet forth of Scotland as we happen to know and they happen to guess it must be evident to the most dull it s what he s aiming for . Where , then , and what way should he be summoned ? I ask it at yourself , a layman . "
32086	32094	32096	32096	I.	1018	" You have given the very words , "
32097	32116	32096	32096	I.	1018	" Here at the cross , and at the pier and shore of Leith , for sixty days . "
32117	32129	32131	32132	the Writer	547	" Ye re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange , then ! "
32134	32197	32131	32132	the Writer	547	" He has had Alan summoned once ; that was on the twenty - fifth , the day that we first met . Once , and done with it . And where ? Where , but at the cross of Inverary , the head burgh of the Campbells ? A word in your ear , Mr. Balfour they re not seeking Alan . "
32198	32204	32205	32205	I	0	" What do you mean ? "
32208	32213	32205	32205	I	0	" Not seeking him ? "
32214	32225	32227	32227	he	547	" By the best that I can make of it , "
32229	32284	32227	32227	he	547	" Not wanting to find him , in my poor thought . They think perhaps he might set up a fair defence , upon the back of which James , the man they re really after , might climb out . This is not a case , ye see , it s a conspiracy . "
32285	32297	32299	32299	I	0	" Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly , "
32301	32321	32299	32299	I	0	" though , when I come to think of it , he was something of the easiest put by . "
32322	32326	32328	32328	he	547	" See that ! "
32330	32488	32328	32328	he	547	" But there ! I may be right or wrong , that s guesswork at the best , and let me get to my facts again . It comes to my ears that James and the witnesses the witnesses , Mr. Balfour ! lay in close dungeons , and shackled forbye , in the military prison at Fort William ; none allowed in to them , nor they to write . The witnesses , Mr. Balfour ; heard ye ever the match of that ? I assure ye , no old , crooked Stewart of the gang ever out - faced the law more impudently . It s clean in the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700 , anent wrongous imprisonment . No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord Justice Clerk . I have his word to - day . There s law for ye ! here s justice ! "
32514	32519	32489	32489	He	1020	" by a bystander , "
32529	32536	32489	32489	He	1020	" poor widow and five children . "
32537	32540	32542	32542	Stewart	199	" See , "
32544	32698	32542	32542	Stewart	199	" he couldn t dare to refuse me access to my client , so he recommends the commanding officer to let me in . Recommends ! the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends . Is not the purpose of such language plain ? They hope the officer may be so dull , or so very much the reverse , as to refuse the recommendation . I would have to make the journey back again betwixt here and Fort William . Then would follow a fresh delay till I got fresh authority , and they had disavowed the officer military man , notoriously ignorant of the law , and that I ken the ca nt of it . Then the journey a third time ; and there we should be on the immediate heels of the trial before I had received my first instruction . Am I not right to call this a conspiracy ? "
32699	32706	32708	32708	I.	1021	" It will bear that colour , "
32709	32721	32723	32723	he	1022	" And I ll go on to prove it you outright , "
32725	32840	32723	32723	he	1022	" They have the right to hold James in prison , yet they can not deny me to visit him . They have no right to hold the witnesses ; but am I to get a sight of them , that should be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk himself ! See read : For the rest , refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not accused as having done anything contrary to the duties of their office . Anything contrary ! Sirs ! And the Act of seventeen hunner ? Mr. Balfour , this makes my heart to burst ; the heather is on fire inside my wame . "
32841	32850	32852	32852	I	0	" And the plain English of that phrase , "
32854	32873	32852	32852	I	0	" is that the witnesses are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them ? "
32874	32891	32893	32893	he	1023	" And I am not to see them until Inverary , when the court is set ! "
32895	32966	32893	32893	he	1023	" and then to hear Prestongrange upon the anxious responsibilities of his office and the great facilities afforded the defence ! But I ll begowk them there , Mr. David . I have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon the road , and see if I cannae get I a little harle of justice out of the military man notoriously ignorant of the law that shall command the party . "
33000	33012	33013	33013	I	0	" There is nothing that would surprise me in this business , "
33016	33026	33028	33028	he	199	" I ll surprise you ere I m done ! "
33030	33036	33028	33028	he	199	" Do ye see this ? "
33046	33093	33028	33028	he	199	" This is the libel : see , there s Prestongrange s name to the list of witnesses , and I find no word of any Balfour . But here is not the question . Who do ye think paid for the printing of this paper ? "
33094	33104	33106	33106	I.	0	" I suppose it would likely be King George , "
33107	33115	33116	33116	he	199	" But it happens it was me ! "
33119	33184	33116	33116	he	199	" Not but it was printed by and for themselves , for the Grants and the Erskines , and yon thief of the black midnight , Simon Fraser . But could I win to get a copy ! No ! I was to go blindfold to my defence ; I was to hear the charges for the first time in court alongst the jury . "
33185	33193	33194	33194	I	0	" Is not this against the law ? "
33197	33205	33206	33206	he	199	" I can not say so much , "
33209	33341	33206	33206	he	199	" It was a favour so natural and so constantly rendered till this nonesuch business that the law has never looked to it . And now admire the hand of Providence ! A stranger is in Fleming s printing house , spies a proof on the floor , picks it up , and carries it to me . Of all things , it was just this libel . Whereupon I had it set again printed at the expense of the defence : sumptibus moesti rei ; heard ever man the like of it ? and here it is for anybody , the muckle secret out all may see it now . But how do you think I would enjoy this , that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience ? "
33342	33353	33355	33355	I.	0	" Troth , I think you would enjoy it ill , "
33356	33365	33366	33366	he	199	" And now you see how it is , "
33369	33392	33366	33366	he	199	" and why , when you tell me your evidence is to be let in , I laugh aloud in your face . "
33490	33494	33496	33496	he	199	" Disappear yourself , "
33498	33505	33507	33507	I.	0	" I do not take you , "
33508	33516	33518	33518	he	199	" Then I ll carry you there , "
33520	33655	33518	33518	he	199	" By my view of it you re to disappear whatever . O , that s outside debate . The Advocate , who is not without some spunks of a remainder decency , has wrung your life - safe out of Simon and the Duke . He has refused to put you on your trial , and refused to have you killed ; and there is the clue to their ill words together , for Simon and the Duke can keep faith with neither friend nor enemy . Ye re not to be tried then , and ye re not to be murdered ; but I m in bitter error if ye re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the Lady Grange . Bet me what ye please there was their expedient ! "
33656	33662	33664	33664	I	0	" You make me think , "
33681	33698	33700	33700	he	1028	" Wherever James More is there s one big rogue , never be deceived on that , "
33702	33872	33700	33700	he	1028	" His father was none so ill a man , though a kenning on the wrong side of the law , and no friend to my family , that I should waste my breath to be defending him ! But as for James he s a brock and a blagyard . I like the appearance of this red - headed Neil as little as yourself . It looks uncanny : fiegh ! it smells bad . It was old Lovat that managed the Lady Grange affair ; if young Lovat is to handle yours , it ll be all in the family . What s James More in prison for ? The same offence : abduction . His men have had practice in the business . He ll be to lend them to be Simon s instruments ; and the next thing we ll be hearing , James will have made his peace , or else he ll have escaped ; and you ll be in Benbecula or Applecross . "
33873	33880	33881	33881	I	0	" Ye make a strong case , "
33884	33890	33891	33891	he	1030	" And what I want , "
33894	33959	33891	33891	he	1030	" is that you should disappear yourself ere they can get their hands upon ye . Lie quiet until just before the trial , and spring upon them at the last of it when they ll be looking for you least . This is always supposing Mr. Balfour , that your evidence is worth so very great a measure of both risk and fash . "
33960	33968	33970	33970	I.	0	" I will tell you one thing , "
33971	33982	33970	33970	I.	0	" I saw the murderer and it was not Alan . "
33983	33994	33996	33996	Stewart	199	" Then , by God , my cousin s saved ! "
33998	34027	34028	34028	He	199	" You have his life upon your tongue ; and there s neither time , risk , nor money to be spared to bring you to the trial . "
34036	34046	34047	34047	he	199	" Here is all that I have by me , "
34051	34100	34047	34047	he	199	" Take it , ye ll want it ere ye re through . Go straight down this close , there s a way out by there to the Lang Dykes , and by my will of it ! see no more of Edinburgh till the clash is over . "
34101	34110	34111	34111	I	0	" Where am I to go , then ? "
34114	34124	34126	34126	he	199	" And I wish that I could tell ye ! "
34128	34205	34126	34126	he	199	" but all the places that I could send ye to , would be just the places they would seek . No , ye must fend for yourself , and God be your guiding ! Five days before the trial , September the sixteen , get word to me at the King s Arms in Stirling ; and if ye ve managed for yourself as long as that , I ll see that ye reach Inverary . "
34206	34211	34213	34213	I.	1031	" One thing more , "
34214	34221	34213	34213	I.	1031	" Can I no see Alan ? "
34226	34235	34237	34237	he	1032	" Hech , I would rather you wouldnae , "
34239	34314	34237	34237	he	1032	" But I can never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it , and is to lie this night by Silvermills on purpose . If you re sure that you re not followed , Mr. Balfour but make sure of that lie in a good place and watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it . It would be a dreadful business if both you and him was to miscarry ! "
34639	34648	34631	34631	I	0	" Here was a lad come seeking saxpence , "
34805	34817	34819	34819	she	864	" Saxpence had better take his broth with us , Catrine , "
34821	34828	34819	34819	she	864	" Run and tell the lasses . "
35050	35056	35058	35058	she	189	" I must not ask ? "
35070	35085	35086	35086	I	0	" Ah , but to - day I can talk with a free conscience , "
35089	35117	35086	35086	I	0	" I am lightened of my pledge , and indeed after what has come and gone since morning I would not have renewed it were it asked . "
35118	35122	35123	35123	she	189	" Tell me , "
35126	35135	35123	35123	she	189	" My cousin will not be so long . "
35176	35199	35201	35201	she	189	" And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the pretty ladies , after all ! "
35208	35241	35201	35201	she	189	" But what was your father that he could not learn you to draw the sword ! It is most ungentle ; I have not heard the match of that in anyone . "
35242	35250	35252	35252	I	0	" It is most misconvenient at least , "
35254	35304	35252	35252	I	0	" and I think my father honest man ! must have been wool - gathering to learn me Latin in the place of it . But you see I do the best I can , and just stand up like Lot s wife and let them hammer at me . "
35305	35314	35316	35316	she	1066	" Do you know what makes me smile ? "
35318	35457	35316	35316	she	1066	" Well , it is this . I am made this way , that I should have been a man child . In my own thoughts it is so I am always ; and I go on telling myself about this thing that is to befall and that . Then it comes to the place of the fighting , and it comes over me that I am only a girl at all events , and can not hold a sword or give one good blow ; and then I have to twist my story round about , so that the fighting is to stop , and yet me have the best of it , just like you and the lieutenant ; and I am the boy that makes the fine speeches all through , like Mr. David Balfour . "
35458	35465	35467	35467	I.	1067	" You are a bloodthirsty maid , "
35468	35486	35487	35487	she	1068	" Well , I know it is good to sew and spin , and to make samplers , "
35490	35535	35487	35487	she	1068	" but if you were to do nothing else in the great world , I think you will say yourself it is a driech business ; and it is not that I want to kill , I think . Did ever you kill anyone ? "
35536	35562	35564	35564	I.	1067	" That I have , as it chances . Two , no less , and me still a lad that should be at the college , "
35565	35582	35564	35564	I.	1067	" But yet , in the look - back , I take no shame for it . "
35583	35594	35595	35595	she	1068	" But how did you feel , then after it ? "
35598	35610	35612	35612	I.	1067	" Deed , I sat down and grat like a bairn , "
35613	35620	35621	35621	she	1068	" I know that , too , "
35624	35684	35685	35685	she	1068	" I feel where these tears should come from . And at any rate , I would not wish to kill , only to be Catherine Douglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt , where it was broken . That is my chief hero . Would you not love to die so for your king ? "
35688	35691	35693	35693	I	0	" Troth , "

35742	35745	35746	35746	she	1068	" Right , "
35749	35791	35746	35746	she	1068	" the right mind of a man ! Only you must learn arms ; I would not like to have a friend that can not strike . But it will not have been with the sword that you killed these two ? "
35792	35797	35799	35799	I	0	" Indeed , no , "
35801	35841	35799	35799	I	0	" but with a pair of pistols . And a fortunate thing it was the men were so near - hand to me , for I am about as clever with the pistols as I am with the sword . "
35869	35872	35874	35874	she	1068	" Yes , "
35876	35891	35874	35874	she	1068	" you are brave . And your friend , I admire and love him . "
35892	35901	35903	35903	I.	0	" Well , and I think anyone would ! "
35904	35937	35942	35942	him	1071	" He has his faults like other folk ; but he is brave and staunch and kind , God bless him ! That will be a strange day when I forget Alan . "
35963	35979	35980	35980	she	1072	" And where will my head be gone that I have not told my news ! "
36017	36026	36028	36028	she	1072	" You do not like to hear it , "
36030	36041	36028	36028	she	1072	" Will you judge my father and not know him ? "

36055	36121	36052	36052	I	0	" And I give you my word I do rejoice to know your heart is lightened . If my face fell at all , as I suppose it must , you will allow this is rather an ill day for compositions , and the people in power extremely ill persons to be compounding with . I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on my stomach still . "
36122	36125	36126	36126	she	1072	" Ah ! "
36129	36159	36126	36126	she	1072	" you will not be evening these two ; and you should bear in mind that Prestongrange and James More , my father , are of the one blood . "

36171	36183	36185	36185	she	1072	" It is rather singular how little you are acquainted with , "
36187	36228	36185	36185	she	1072	" One part may call themselves Grant , and one Macgregor , but they are still of the same clan . They are all the sons of Alpin , from whom , I think , our country has its name . "
36229	36235	36236	36236	I	0	" What country is that ? "

36263	36275	36261	36261	I	0	" for I always thought the name of it was Scotland . "
36276	36287	36288	36288	she	1072	" Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland , "
36291	36355	36288	36288	she	1072	" But the old ancient true name of this place that we have our foot - soles on , and that our bones are made of , will be Alban . It was Alban they called it when our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and Alexander ; and it is called so still in your own tongue that you forget . "

36558	36568	36569	36569	she	189	" It is long till I see you now ? "
36572	36579	36580	36580	I	0	" It is beyond my judging , "
36583	36594	36580	36580	I	0	" It will be long , it may be never . "

36621	36630	36632	36632	she	189	" So am I , at all events , "
36634	36781	36632	36632	she	189	" I have seen you but a small time , but I put you very high . You are true , you are brave ; in time I think you will be more of a man yet . I will be proud to hear of that . If you should speed worse , if it will come to fall as we are afraid O well ! think you have the one friend . Long after you are dead and me an old wife , I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour , and my tears running . I will be telling how we parted , and what I said to you , and did to you . God go with you and guide you , prays your little friend : so I said I will be telling them and here is what I did . "

36831	36847	36829	36829	she	1080	" that is what I think of you . The head goes with the lips . "

37355	37397	37354	37354	I.	0	" It would be a sin and shame not to walk carefully . I was doubtful whether I did right to come here . I would like it ill , if it was by that means we were brought to harm . "
37398	37426	37427	37427	she	189	" I could tell you one that would be liking it less , and will like little enough to hear you talking at this very same time , "
37430	37440	37427	37427	she	189	" What have I done , at all events ? "
37441	37451	37452	37452	I	0	" O , you I you are not alone , "
37455	37494	37452	37452	I	0	" But since I went off I have been dogged again , and I can give you the name of him that follows me . It is Neil , son of Duncan , your man or your father s. "

37536	37591	37534	37534	I	0	" the last of it . But for his being in Edinburgh I think I can show you another of that . For sure you have some signal , a signal of need , such as would bring him to your help , if he was anywhere within the reach of ears and legs ? "
37592	37601	37603	37603	she	189	" Why , how will you know that ? "
37605	37633	37635	37635	I.	0	" By means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born , and the name they call it by is Common - sense , "

37840	37901	37838	37838	I	0	" judge how near he was to Edinburgh , or what was the nature of your father s errands . Ask himself . If I am to lose my life , or the lives of those that hang by me , through the means of your clan , let me go where I have to go with my eyes open . "
37978	37985	37986	37986	she	1099	" He swears it is not , "

38025	38035	38037	38037	I.	0	" But I must find some means to know , "
38038	38133	38037	38037	I.	0	" I can not continue to go dovering round in the black night with two men s lives at my girdle ! Catriona , try to put yourself in my place , as I vow to God I try hard to put myself in yours . This is no kind of talk that should ever have fallen between me and you ; no kind of talk ; my heart is sick with it . See , keep him here till two of the morning , and I care not . Try him with that . "
38143	38155	38157	38157	she	1104	" He says he has James More my father s errand , "
38174	38181	38183	38183	I	0	" It is pretty plain now , "
38185	38193	38183	38183	I	0	" and may God forgive the wicked ! "

38253	38274	38250	38250	she	1104	" Could I go against my father s orders , him in prison , in the danger of his life ! "
38275	38283	38285	38285	I.	0	" But perhaps we go too fast , "
38286	38314	38285	38285	I.	0	" This may be a lie too . He may have no right orders ; all may be contrived by Simon , and your father knowing nothing . "

38350	38370	38348	38348	I	0	" keep him but the one hour ; and I ll chance it , and may God bless you . "

38392	38399	38401	38401	I	0	" The full hour , then ? "
38409	38418	38401	38401	I	0	" Three lives of it , my lass ! "
38419	38424	38425	38425	she	1104	" The full hour ! "
38491	38511	38480	38480	Alan	185	" in a bit scrog of wood by east of Silvermills and by south the south mill - lade . "
38724	38736	38738	38738	I	0	" What wild game is this that I have been playing ? "
39554	39562	39565	39565	I	0	" How can Satan cast out Satan ? "

39963	39967	39969	39969	I.	0	" Just myself , "
39970	39984	39986	39986	he	185	" God , man , but I ve been wearying to see ye ! "
39988	40077	39986	39986	he	185	" I ve had the longest kind of a time . A day , I ve had my dwelling into the inside of a stack of hay , where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers ; and then two hours of it waiting here for you , and you never coming ! Dod , and ye re none too soon the way it is , with me to sail the morn ! The morn ? what am I saying ? the day , I mean . "
40078	40091	40093	40093	I.	0	" Ay , Alan , man , the day , sure enough , "
40094	40120	40093	40093	I.	0	" It s past twelve now , surely , and ye sail the day . This ll be a long road you have before you . "
40121	40132	40134	40134	he	185	" We ll have a long crack of it first , "
40136	40155	40157	40157	I.	0	" Well , indeed , and I have a good deal it will be telling you to hear , "
40226	40237	40239	40239	he	185	" Ay , Davie , ye re a queer character , "
40246	40432	40433	40433	he	1153	" a queer bitch after a , and I have no mind of meeting with the like of ye . As for your story , Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel , so I ll say the less of him ; and , dod ! I believe he was the best friend ye had , if ye could only trust him . But Simon Fraser and James More are my ain kind of cattle , and I ll give them the name that they deserve . The muckle black deil was father to the Frasers , a body kens that ; and as for the Gregara , I never could abye the reek of them since I could stotter on two feet . I bloodied the nose of one , I mind , when I was still so wambly on my legs that I cowped upon the top of him . A proud man was my father that day , God rest him ! and I think he had the cause . I ll never can deny but what Robin was something of a piper , "
40436	40450	40433	40433	he	1153	" but as for James More , the deil guide him for me ! "
40451	40459	40461	40461	I.	1154	" One thing we have to consider , "
40462	40484	40461	40461	I.	1154	" Was Charles Stewart right or wrong ? Is it only me they re after , or the pair of us ? "
40485	40503	40505	40505	he	1153	" And what s your ain opinion , you that s a man of so much experience ? "
40507	40512	40514	40514	I.	1154	" It passes me , "
40515	40520	40522	40522	Alan	185	" And me too , "
40524	40537	40538	40538	he	1153	" Do ye think this lass would keep her word to ye ? "
40541	40546	40548	40548	I.	1154	" I do that , "
40549	40557	40559	40559	he	1153	" Well , there s nae telling , "
40561	40583	40559	40559	he	1153	" And anyway , that s over and done : he ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne . "
40584	40596	40597	40597	I	0	" How many would ye think there would be of them ? "
40600	40604	40606	40606	Alan	185	" That depends , "
40608	40647	40649	40649	he	185	" If it was only you , they would likely send two - three lively , brisk young birkies , and if they thought that I was to appear in the employ , I daresay ten or twelve , "
40664	40689	40691	40691	he	185	" And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number , or the double of it , nearer hand ! "
40693	40699	40701	40701	I	0	" It matters the less , "
40703	40715	40701	40701	I	0	" because I am well rid of them for this time . "
40716	40724	40726	40726	he	185	" Nae doubt that s your opinion , "
40728	40875	40726	40726	he	185	" but I wouldnae be the least surprised if they were hunkering this wood . Ye see , David man ; they ll be Hieland folk . There ll be some Frasers , I m thinking , and some of the Gregara ; and I would never deny but what the both of them , and the Gregara in especial , were clever experienced persons . A man kens little till he s driven a spreagh of neat cattle say ten miles through a throng lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail . It s there that I learned a great part of my penetration . And ye need nae tell me : it s better than war ; which is the next best , however , though generally rather a bauchle of a business . Now the Gregara have had grand practice . "
40876	40892	40894	40894	I.	1155	" No doubt that s a branch of education that was left out with me , "
40895	40908	40910	40910	Alan	185	" And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly , "
40912	41016	40910	40910	Alan	185	" But that s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning : ye re ignorat , and ye cannae see t. Wae s me for my Greek and Hebrew ; but , man , I ken that I dinnae ken them there s the differ of it . Now , here s you . Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood , and ye tell me that ye ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors . Why ? Because I couldnae see them , says you . Ye blockhead , that s their livelihood . "
41017	41024	41026	41026	I	0	" Take the worst of it , "
41028	41036	41026	41026	I	0	" and what are we to do ? "
41037	41045	41047	41047	he	1156	" I am thinking of that same , "
41049	41269	41047	41047	he	1156	" We might twine . It wouldnae be greatly to my taste ; and forbye that , I see reasons against it . First , it s now unco dark , and it s just humanly possible we might give them the clean slip . If we keep together , we make but the ae line of it ; if we gang separate , we make twae of them : the more likelihood to stave in upon some of these gentry of yours . And then , second , if they keep the track of us , it may come to a fecht for it yet , Davie ; and then , I ll confess I would be blythe to have you at my oxter , and I think you would be none the worse of having me at yours . So , by my way of it , we should creep out of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute , and hold away east for Gillane , where I m to find my ship . It ll be like old days while it lasts , Davie ; and come the time we ll have to think what you should be doing . I m wae to leave ye here , wanting me . "
41270	41277	41279	41279	I.	1157	" Have with ye , then ! "
41280	41290	41279	41279	I.	1157	" Do ye gang back where you were stopping ? "
41291	41296	41298	41298	Alan	185	" Deil a fear ! "
41300	41393	41298	41298	Alan	185	" They were good folks to me , but I think they would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again . For the way times go I am nae just what ye could call a Walcome Guest . Which makes me the keener for your company , Mr. David Balfour of the Shaws , and set ye up ! For , leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with Charlie Stewart , I have scarce said black or white since the day we parted at Corstorphine . "
41715	41720	41722	41722	he	185	" Well , Davie , "
41724	41780	41722	41722	he	185	" is this no a bonny morning ? Here is a day that looks the way that a day ought to . This is a great change of it from the belly of my haystack ; and while you were there sottering and sleeping I have done a thing that maybe I do very seldom . "
41781	41787	41789	41789	I.	0	" And what was that ? "
41790	41798	41800	41800	he	185	" O , just said my prayers , "
41802	41814	41815	41815	I	0	" And where are my gentry , as ye call them ? "
41818	41822	41824	41824	he	185	" Gude kens , "
41826	41873	41824	41824	he	185	" and the short and the long of it is that we must take our chance of them . Up with your foot - soles , Davie ! Forth , Fortune , once again of it ! And a bonny walk we are like to have . "
41934	41941	41943	41943	he	185	" I feel like a gomeral , "
41945	41974	41943	41943	he	185	" to be leaving Scotland on a day like this . It sticks in my head ; I would maybe like it better to stay here and hing . "
41975	41984	41986	41986	I.	1175	" Ay , but ye wouldnae , Alan , "
41987	41999	42000	42000	he	185	" No , but what France is a good place too , "
42003	42051	42000	42000	he	185	" but it s some way no the same . It s brawer I believe , but it s no Scotland . I like it fine when I m there , man ; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the Scots peat - reek . "
42052	42072	42074	42074	I.	1175	" If that s all you have to complain of , Alan , it s no such great affair , "
42075	42087	42089	42089	he	185	" And it sets me ill to be complaining , whatever , "
42091	42103	42089	42089	he	185	" and me but new out of yon deil s haystack . "
42104	42115	42116	42116	I	0	" And so you were unco weary of your haystack ? "
42119	42127	42129	42129	he	185	" Weary s nae word for it , "
42131	42240	42129	42129	he	185	" I m not just precisely a man that s easily cast down ; but I do better with caller air and the lift above my head . I m like the auld Black Douglas wasnae t ? that likit better to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep . And yon place , ye see , Davie whilk was a very suitable place to hide in , as I m free to own was pit mirk from dawn to gloaming . There were days or nights , for how would I tell one from other ? that seemed to me as long as a long winter . "

42257	42282	42284	42284	he	185	" The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy , and a candle - dowp to eat it by , about eleeven , "
42286	42318	42320	42320	he	185	" So , when I had swallowed a bit , it would he time to be getting to the wood . There I lay and wearied for ye sore , Davie , "
42328	42378	42323	42323	his	185	" and guessed when the two hours would be about by unless Charlie Stewart would come and tell me on his watch and then back to the dooms haystack . Na , it was a driech employ , and praise the Lord that I have warstled through with it ! "
42379	42387	42388	42388	I	0	" What did you do with yourself ? "
42391	42394	42396	42396	he	185	" Faith , "
42398	42443	42396	42396	he	185	" the best I could ! Whiles I played at the knucklebones . I m an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones , but it s a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye . And whiles I would make songs . "
42444	42450	42452	42452	I.	0	" What were they about ? "
42453	42463	42465	42465	he	185	" O , about the deer and the heather , "
42467	42549	42465	42465	he	185	" and about the ancient old chiefs that are all by with it lang syne , and just about what songs are about in general . And then whiles I would make believe I had a set of pipes and I was playing . I played some grand springs , and I thought I played them awful bonny ; I vow whiles that I could hear the squeal of them ! But the great affair is that it s done with . "
42580	42588	42552	42552	he	185	" a queer character of a callant . "
42589	42599	42600	42600	he	185	" So ye were frich ened of Sim Fraser ? "
42604	42610	42612	42612	I.	0	" In troth was I ! "
42613	42622	42624	42624	he	185	" So would I have been , Davie , "
42626	42664	42624	42624	he	185	" And that is indeed a driedful man . But it is only proper to give the deil his due : and I can tell you he is a most respectable person on the field of war . "
42665	42671	42672	42672	I	0	" Is he so brave ? "
42675	42678	42680	42680	he	185	" Brave ! "
42682	42692	42680	42680	he	185	" He is as brave as my steel sword . "
42703	42709	42710	42710	he	185	" To think of that ! "
42713	42772	42710	42710	he	185	" I showed ye the trick in Corrynakiegh too . And three times three times disarmed ! It s a disgrace upon my character that learned ye ! Here , stand up , out with your airn ; ye shall walk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel and me mair credit . "
42773	42776	42778	42778	I	0	" Alan , "
42780	42794	42778	42778	I	0	" this is midsummer madness . Here is no time for fencing lessons . "
42795	42804	42805	42805	he	185	" I cannae well say no to that , "
42808	42884	42805	42805	he	185	" But three times , man ! And you standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword like a doggie with a pocket - napkin ! David , this man Duncansby must be something altogether by - ordinar ! He maun be extraordinar skilly . If I had the time , I would gang straight back and try a turn at him mysel . The man must be a provost . "
42885	42890	42892	42892	I	0	" You silly fellow , "
42894	42902	42892	42892	I	0	" you forget it was just me . "
42903	42906	42908	42908	he	185	" Na , "
42910	42915	42908	42908	he	185	" but three times ! "
42916	42927	42928	42928	I	0	" When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent , "
42931	42943	42945	42945	he	185	" Well , I never heard tell the equal of it , "
42947	42957	42959	42959	I.	0	" I promise you the one thing , Alan , "
42960	42990	42959	42959	I.	0	" The next time that we forgather , I ll be better learned . You shall not continue to bear the disgrace of a friend that can not strike . "
42991	42998	43000	43000	he	185	" Ay , the next time ! "
43002	43015	43000	43000	he	185	" And when will that be , I would like to ken ? "
43016	43031	43033	43033	I	0	" Well , Alan , I have had some thoughts of that , too , "
43035	43052	43033	43033	I	0	" and my plan is this . It s my opinion to be called an advocate . "
43053	43063	43065	43065	Alan	185	" That s but a weary trade , Davie , "
43067	43087	43065	43065	Alan	185	" and rather a blagyard one forby . Ye would be better in a king s coat than that . "
43088	43102	43104	43104	I.	0	" And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet , "
43105	43135	43104	43104	I.	0	" But as you ll be in King Lewie s coat , and I ll be in King Geordie s , we ll have a dainty meeting of it . "
43136	43144	43145	43145	he	185	" There s some sense in that , "
43148	43160	43161	43161	I	0	" An advocate , then , it ll have to be , "
43164	43254	43161	43161	I	0	" and I think it a more suitable trade for a gentleman that was three times disarmed . But the beauty of the thing is this : that one of the best colleges for that kind of learning and the one where my kinsman , Pilrig , made his studies is the college of Leyden in Holland . Now , what say you , Alan ? Could not a cadet of Royal Ecossais get a furlough , slip over the marches , and call in upon a Leyden student ? "
43255	43265	43267	43267	he	1176	" Well , and I would think he could ! "
43269	43366	43267	43267	he	1176	" Ye see , I stand well in with my colonel , Count Drummond - Melfort ; and , what s mair to the purpose I have a cousin of mine lieutenant - colonel in a regiment of the Scots - Dutch . Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a leave to see Lieutenant - Colonel Stewart of Halkett s. And Lord Melfort , who is a very scienteefic kind of a man , and writes books like Casar , would be doubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes . "
43367	43376	43377	43377	I	0	" Is Lord Meloort an author , then ? "
43398	43405	43407	43407	he	185	" The very same , Davie , "
43409	43432	43407	43407	he	185	" One would think a colonel would have something better to attend to . But what can I say that make songs ? "
43433	43438	43440	43440	I	0	" Well , then , "
43442	43474	43440	43440	I	0	" it only remains you should give me an address to write you at in France ; and as soon as I am got to Leyden I will send you mine . "
43475	43490	43492	43492	he	185	" The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain , "
43494	43540	43492	43492	he	185	" Charles Stewart , of Ardsheil , Esquire , at the town of Melons , in the Isle of France . It might take long , or it might take short , but it would aye get to my hands at the last of it . "
43928	43934	43936	43936	he	185	" What do ye want ? "
43938	44077	43936	43936	he	185	" A man should aye put his best foot forrit with the womankind ; he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert them , the poor lambs ! It s what ye should learn to attend to , David ; ye should get the principles , it s like a trade . Now , if this had been a young lassie , or onyways bonnie , she would never have heard tell of my stomach , Davie . But aince they re too old to be seeking joes , they a set up to be apotecaries . Why ? What do I ken ? They ll be just the way God made them , I suppose . But I think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his attention to the same . "
44193	44202	44203	44206	the good - wife	1201	" We pit a fomentation to his feet , "
44210	44242	44203	44206	the good - wife	1201	" and a het stane to his wame , and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal , and fine , clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast . . . "
44243	44246	44248	44248	I	0	" Sir , "
44255	44267	44248	44248	I	0	" there s a friend of mine gone by the house . "
44268	44275	44277	44277	Alan	185	" Is that e en sae ? "
44292	44299	44301	44301	he	185	" Ye were saying , mem ? "
44333	44342	44344	44344	Alan	185	" Was it him with the red head ? "
44346	44351	44353	44353	I.	0	" Ye have it , "
44354	44364	44365	44365	he	185	" What did I tell you in the wood ? "
44368	44385	44365	44365	he	185	" And yet it s strange he should be here too ! Was he his lane ? "
44386	44397	44399	44399	I.	0	" His lee - lane for what I could see , "
44400	44406	44407	44407	he	185	" Did he gang by ? "
44410	44414	44416	44416	I	0	" Straight by , "
44418	44428	44416	44416	I	0	" and looked neither to the right nor left . "
44429	44436	44438	44438	Alan	185	" And that s queerer yet , "
44440	44470	44472	44472	he	185	" It sticks in my mind , Davie , that we should be stirring . But where to ? deil hae t ! This is like old days fairly , "
44474	44483	44485	44485	I	0	" There is one big differ , though , "
44487	44497	44485	44485	I	0	" that now we have money in our pockets . "
44498	44507	44509	44509	he	185	" And another big differ , Mr. Balfour , "
44511	44546	44509	44509	he	185	" that now we have dogs at our tail . They re on the scent ; they re in full cry , David . It s a bad business and be damned to it . "
44562	44569	44571	44571	he	185	" I m saying , Luckie , "
44578	44590	44574	44575	the goodwife	1203	" have ye a back road out of this change house ? "
44602	44607	44609	44609	he	185	" Then , sir , "
44613	44649	44609	44609	he	185	" I think that will be the shortest road for us . And here s good - bye to ye , my braw woman ; and I ll no forget thon of the cinnamon water . "
44698	44708	44710	44710	he	185	" Now for a council of war , Davie , "
44712	44807	44710	44710	he	185	" But first of all , a bit lesson to ye . Suppose that I had been like you , what would yon old wife have minded of the pair of us ! Just that we had gone out by the back gate . And what does she mind now ? A fine , canty , friendly , cracky man , that suffered with the stomach , poor body ! and was real ta en up about the goodbrother . O man , David , try and learn to have some kind of intelligence ! "
44808	44815	44817	44817	I.	1210	" I ll try , Alan , "
44818	44828	44830	44830	he	185	" And now for him of the red head , "
44832	44840	44830	44830	he	185	" was he gaun fast or slow ? "
44841	44846	44848	44848	I.	1210	" Betwixt and between , "
44849	44859	44860	44860	he	185	" No kind of a hurry about the man ? "
44863	44870	44872	44872	I.	1210	" Never a sign of it , "
44873	44876	44878	44878	Alan	185	" Nhm ! "
44880	44956	44878	44878	Alan	185	" it looks queer . We saw nothing of them this morning on the Whins ; he s passed us by , he doesnae seem to be looking , and yet here he is on our road ! Dod , Davie , I begin to take a notion . I think it s no you they re seeking , I think it s me ; and I think they ken fine where they re gaun . "
44957	44961	44962	44962	I	0	" They ken ? "
44965	44998	45000	45000	Alan	185	" I think Andie Scougal s sold me him or his mate wha kent some part of the affair or else Charlie s clerk callant , which would be a pity too , "
45002	45026	45000	45000	Alan	185	" and if you askit me for just my inward private conviction , I think there ll be heads cracked on Gillane sands . "
45027	45030	45031	45031	I	0	" Alan , "
45034	45059	45031	45031	I	0	" if you re at all right there ll be folk there and to spare . It ll be small service to crack heads . "
45060	45069	45071	45071	Alan	185	" It would aye be a satisfaction though , "
45073	45126	45128	45128	he	185	" But bide a bit ; bide a bit ; I m thinking and thanks to this bonny westland wind , I believe I ve still a chance of it . It s this way , Davie . I m no trysted with this man Scougal till the gloaming comes . But , "
45130	45152	45153	45153	he	185	" if I can get a bit of a wind out of the west I ll be there long or that , "
45156	45295	45128	45128	he	185	" and lie - to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra . Now if your gentry kens the place , they ken the time forbye . Do ye see me coming , Davie ? Thanks to Johnnie Cope and other red - coat gomerals , I should ken this country like the back of my hand ; and if ye re ready for another bit run with Alan Breck , we ll can cast back inshore , and come to the seaside again by Dirleton . If the ship s there , we ll try and get on board of her . If she s no there , I ll just have to get back to my weary haystack . But either way of it , I think we will leave your gentry whistling on their thumbs . "
45296	45306	45308	45308	I.	1211	" I believe there s some chance in it , "
45309	45317	45308	45308	I.	1211	" Have on with ye , Alan ! "
45417	45424	45425	45425	he	185	" Has ye seen my horse ? "
45428	45441	45443	45444	the countryman	1215	" Na , man , I haenae seen nae horse the day , "
45459	45463	45443	45444	the countryman	1215	" ride and tie "
45515	45523	45524	45524	he	1216	" Them that cannae tell the truth , "
45534	45589	45524	45524	he	1216	" should be aye mindful to leave an honest , handy lee behind them . If folk dinnae ken what ye re doing , Davie , they re terrible taken up with it ; but if they think they ken , they care nae mair for it than what I do for pease porridge . "
46003	46006	46008	46008	he	185	" Davie , "
46010	46070	46008	46008	he	185	" this is a kittle passage ! As long as we lie here we re safe ; but I m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of France . And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig , it s another matter . For where will your gentry be , think ye ? "
46071	46079	46081	46081	I.	1246	" Maybe they re no come yet , "
46082	46130	46081	46081	I.	1246	" And even if they are , there s one clear matter in our favour . They ll be all arranged to take us , that s true . But they ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we are upon their west . "
46131	46134	46136	46136	Alan	185	" Ay , "
46138	46189	46136	46136	Alan	185	" I wish we were in some force , and this was a battle , we would have bonnily out - manouvred them ! But it isnae , Davit ; and the way it is , is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck . I swither , Davie . "
46190	46196	46198	46198	I.	1246	" Time flies , Alan , "
46199	46204	46206	46206	Alan	185	" I ken that , "
46208	46243	46206	46206	Alan	185	" I ken naething else , as the French folk say . But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails . O ! if I could but ken where your gentry were ! "
46244	46247	46249	46249	I	0	" Alan , "
46251	46267	46249	46249	I	0	" this is no like you . It s got to be now or never . "
46268	46277	46206	46206	Alan	185	" This is no me , quo he , "
46290	46316	46206	46206	Alan	185	" Neither you nor me , quo he , neither you nor me . Wow , na , Johnnie man ! neither you nor me . "
46510	46518	46520	46520	he	185	" It maun be as it will ! "
46528	46545	46520	46520	he	185	" Weel may yon boatie row , or my craig ll have to thole a raxing . "
46636	46647	46649	46649	Alan	185	" There is one thing I would like to ken , "
46651	46699	46649	46649	Alan	185	" I would like to ken these gentry s orders . We re worth four hunner pound the pair of us : how if they took the guns to us , Davie ! They would get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank . "
46700	46704	46706	46706	I.	1267	" Morally impossible , "
46707	46736	46706	46706	I.	1267	" The point is that they can have no guns . This thing has been gone about too secret ; pistols they may have , but never guns . "
46737	46747	46749	46749	Alan	185	" I believe ye ll be in the right , "
46751	46765	46749	46749	Alan	185	" For all which I am wearing a good deal for yon boat . "
46869	46884	46886	46886	Alan	185	" This is a fine , bright , caller place to get shot in , "
46889	46902	46886	46886	Alan	185	" and , man , I wish that I had your courage ! "
46903	46906	46907	46907	I	0	" Alan ! "
46910	46946	46907	46907	I	0	" what kind of talk is this of it ! You re just made of courage ; it s the character of the man , as I could prove myself if there was nobody else . "
46947	46956	46958	46958	he	185	" And you would be the more mistaken , "
46960	47083	46958	46958	he	185	" What makes the differ with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs . But for auld , cauld , dour , deadly courage , I am not fit to hold a candle to yourself . Look at us two here upon the sands . Here am I , fair hotching to be off ; here s you for all that I ken in two minds of it whether you ll no stop . Do you think that I could do that , or would ? No me ! Firstly , because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur ; and secondly , because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye damned first . "
47084	47095	47096	47096	I	0	" It s there ye re coming , is it ? "
47099	47119	47096	47096	I	0	" Ah , man Alan , you can wile your old wives , but you never can wile me . "
47133	47141	47142	47142	I	0	" I have a tryst to keep , "
47145	47160	47142	47142	I	0	" I am trysted with your cousin Charlie ; I have passed my word . "

47174	47194	47195	47195	he	185	" Ye ll just mistryst aince and for a with the gentry in the bents . And what for ? "
47204	47281	47282	47282	he	185	" Just tell me that , my mannie ! Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange ? Are they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents ? Or is it to be the other way , and are they to bring ye in with James ? Are they folk to be trustit ? Would ye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs ? "
47288	47291	47293	47293	I	0	" Alan , "
47295	47399	47293	47293	I	0	" they re all rogues and liars , and I m with ye there . The more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves ! My word is passed , and I ll stick to it . I said long syne to your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk . Do ye mind of that ? the night Red Colin fell , it was . No more I will , then . Here I stop . Prestongrange promised me my life : if he s to be mansworn , here I ll have to die . "
47400	47404	47406	47406	Alan	185	" Aweel aweel , "

We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the rock , and one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to - morrow . Yon Neil has a queer eye when he regards you ; maybe , if I was once out of the gate there might be knives again ; these red - shanks are unco grudgeful . And if there should come to be any question , here is your excuse . Our lives were in danger by these savages ; being answerable for my safety , you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat : and do you know , Andie ? "
59915	59924	59909	59909	I	0	" I think it was very wisely chosen . "
59925	59936	59938	59938	Andie	297	" The truth is I have nae goo for Neil , "
59940	59978	59938	59938	Andie	297	" nor he for me , I m thinking ; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi the man . Tam Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway . "
59996	60001	60003	60003	Andie	297	" Ay , ay ! "
60005	60070	60071	60071	he	297	" Tam ll can deal with them the best . And troth ! the mair I think of it , the less I see we would be required . The place ay , feggs ! they had forgot the place . Eh , Shaws , ye re a lang - heided chield when ye like ! Forby that I m awing ye my life , "
61238	61260	61261	61262	the minister	1411	" Thirteently , my brethren , and in parenthesis , the law itself must be regarded as a means of grace , "
61933	61940	61941	61941	I	0	" Am I yet in time ? "
61944	61949	61951	61951	he	1411	" Ay and no , "
61953	62055	61951	61951	he	1411	" The case is over ; the jury is enclosed , and will so kind as let us ken their view of it to - morrow in the morning , the same as I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began . The thing has been public from the start . The panel kent it , Ye may do what ye will for me , whispers he two days ago . Ye ken my fate by what the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr. Macintosh . O , it s been a scandal !
62056	62073	62075	62077	the very macer	1816	" The great Agyle he gaed before , He gart the cannons and guns to roar , "
62123	62123	62124	62124	He	1822	"
62187	62195	62199	62199	his	1822	" We ll ding the Campbells yet ! "
62432	62437	62439	62439	Colstoun	335	" To sum up , "
62441	62600	62439	62439	Colstoun	335	" you prove that Alan was on the spot ; you have heard him proffer menaces against Glenure ; and though you assure us he was not the man who fired , you leave a strong impression that he was in league with him , and consenting , perhaps immediately assisting , in the act . You show him besides , at the risk of his own liberty , actively furthering the criminal s escape . And the rest of your testimony so far as the least material depends on the bare word of Alan or of James , the two accused . In short , you do not at all break , but only lengthen by one personage , the chain that binds our client to the murderer ; and I need scarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling block from the beginning . "
62601	62609	62611	62612	Sheriff Miller	336	" I am of the same opinion , "
62614	62673	62611	62612	Sheriff Miller	336	" I think we may all be very much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way . And chiefly , I think , Mr. Balfour himself might be obliged . For you talk of a third accomplice , but Mr. Balfour in my view has very much the appearance of a fourth . "
62674	62680	62682	62682	Stewart	181	" Allow me , sirs ! "
62686	62788	62682	62682	Stewart	181	" There is another view . Here we have a witness never fash whether material or not a witness in this cause , kidnapped by that old , lawless , bandit crew of the Glengyle Macgregors , and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old ruins on the Bass . Move that and see what dirt you fling on the proceedings ! Sirs , this is a tale to make the world ring with ! It would be strange , with such a grip as this , if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon for my client . "
62789	62803	62805	62806	Stewart Hall	337	" And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour s cause to - morrow ? "
62808	62962	62805	62806	Stewart Hall	337	" I am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown in our path , as that James should have been hanged before we had found a court to hear us . This is a great scandal , but I suppose we have none of us forgot a greater still , I mean the matter of the Lady Grange . The woman was still in durance ; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was humanly possible ; and how did he speed ? He never got a warrant ! Well , it ll be the same now ; the same weapons will be used . This is a scene , gentleman , of clan animosity . The hatred of the name which I have the honour to bear , rages in high quarters . There is nothing here to be viewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue . "
63250	63261	63263	63263	he	2976	" That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked , "
63265	63289	63263	63263	he	2976	" The interest of our client goes certainly before all , but the world does not come to an end with James Stewart . "
63296	63357	63291	63291	he	2976	" I might condescend , exempli gratia , upon a Mr. George Brown , a Mr. Thomas Miller , and a Mr. David Balfour . Mr. David Balfour has a very good ground of complaint , and I think , gentlemen if his story was properly redd out I think there would be a number of wigs on the green . "
63369	63390	63391	63391	he	2976	" Properly handled and carefully redd out , his is a story that could scarcely fail to have some consequence , "
63394	63426	63427	63427	He	2976	" The whole administration of justice , from its highest officer downward , would be totally discredited ; and it looks to me as if they would need to be replaced . "
63438	63463	63464	63464	he	2976	" And I need not point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour s would be a remarkable bonny cause to appear in , "
63552	63562	63564	63564	he	338	" We have here before us a dreeping roast , "
63566	63579	63564	63564	he	338	" here is cut - and - come - again for all . "
63616	63619	63621	63621	he	181	" Gentlemen , "
63627	63665	63667	63667	he	181	" here is to Sheriff Miller . His legal abilities are known to all . His culinary , this bowl in front of us is here to speak for . But when it comes to the poleetical ! "
63674	63690	63694	63694	Miller	336	" Ay , but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning , my friend , "
63696	63739	63694	63694	Miller	336	" A revolution , if you like , and I think I can promise you that historical writers shall date from Mr. Balfour s cause . But properly guided , Mr. Stewart , tenderly guided , it shall prove a peaceful revolution . "
63740	63755	63757	63757	Stewart	337	" And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed , what care I ? "
63837	63850	63852	63852	I.	0	" I have to thank you , gentlemen , for your advice , "
63853	63901	63852	63852	I.	0	" And now I would like , by your leave , to set you two or three questions . There is one thing that has fallen rather on one aide , for instance : Will this cause do any good to our friend James of the Glens ? "
63935	63941	63943	63943	I	0	" To proceed , then , "
63945	64100	63943	63943	I	0	" will it do any good to Scotland ? We have a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest . I remember hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child , which gave occasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous ; and I always understood that we had rather lost than gained by that . Then came the year Forty - five , which made Scotland to be talked of everywhere ; but I never heard it said we had anyway gained by the Forty - five . And now we come to this cause of Mr. Balfour s , as you call it . Sheriff Miller tells us historical writers are to date from it , and I would not wonder . It is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and public reproach . "
64125	64132	64134	64134	he	336	" Forcibly put , Mr. Balfour , "
64136	64143	64134	64134	he	336	" A weighty observe , sir . "
64144	64160	64161	64161	I	0	" We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George , "
64164	64208	64161	64161	I	0	" Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this ; but I doubt you will scarce be able to pull down the house from under him , without his Majesty coming by a knock or two , one of which might easily prove fatal . "
64221	64233	64234	64234	I	0	" Of those for whom the case was to be profitable , "
64238	64409	64234	64234	I	0	" Sheriff Miller gave us the names of several , among the which he was good enough to mention mine . I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise . I believe I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to be saved ; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded , and I own I think it would be a pity for a young man , with some idea of coming to the Bar , to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent , factious fellow before he was yet twenty . As for James , it seems at this date of the proceedings , with the sentence as good as pronounced he has no hope but in the King s mercy . May not his Majesty , then , be more pointedly addressed , the characters of these high officers sheltered from the public , and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for me ? "
64440	64458	64460	64460	he	336	" If I may be allowed to put my young friend s notion in more formal shape , "
64462	64571	64460	64460	he	336	" I understand him to propose that we should embody the fact of his sequestration , and perhaps some heads of the testimony he was prepared to offer , in a memorial to the Crown . This plan has elements of success . It is as likely as any other and perhaps likelier to help our client . Perhaps his Majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such a memorial , which might be construed into an expression of a very delicate loyalty ; and I think , in the drafting of the same , this view might be brought forward . "
64594	64606	64608	64608	Miller	336	" Paper , then , Mr. Stewart , if you please , "
64610	64635	64608	64608	Miller	336	" and I think it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present , as procurators for the condemned man . "
64636	64649	64658	64658	he	335	" It can do none of us any harm , at least , "
64888	64896	64898	64898	he	335	" This is a very confidential document , "
64900	64910	64911	64911	I	0	" And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar , "
64914	65036	64911	64911	I	0	" No question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview , so that he has since stood my friend consistently . But for him , gentlemen , I must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James . For which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial as soon as it is copied . You are to consider also that this step will make for my protection . I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard ; his Grace is in his own country , Lovat by his side ; and if there should hang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well awake in gaol . "
65187	65197	65199	65199	he	182	" So , Mr. David , this is you ? "
65201	65214	65216	65216	I.	0	" Where I fear I am not overly welcome , my lord , "
65217	65243	65216	65216	I.	0	" And I would like before I go further to express my sense of your lordship s good offices , even should they now cease . "
65244	65253	65254	65254	he	182	" I have heard of your gratitude before , "
65258	65298	65254	65254	he	182	" and I think this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to . I would remember also , if I were you , that you still stand on a very boggy foundation . "
65299	65309	65311	65311	I	0	" Not now , my lord , I think , "
65313	65334	65311	65311	I	0	" and if your lordship will but glance an eye along this , you will perhaps think as I do . "
65369	65382	65384	65384	he	182	" This is not so bad but what it might be worse , "
65386	65403	65384	65384	he	182	" though I am still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David Balfour . "
65404	65418	65420	65420	I.	0	" Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man , my lord , "
65437	65447	65448	65448	he	182	" And to whom am I indebted for this ? "
65452	65475	65448	65448	he	182	" Other counsels must have been discussed , I think . Who was it proposed this private method ? Was it Miller ? "
65476	65484	65486	65486	I.	0	" My lord , it was myself , "
65487	65591	65486	65486	I.	0	" These gentlemen have shown me no such consideration , as that I should deny myself any credit I can fairly claim , or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear . And the mere truth is , that they were all in favour of a process which should have remarkable consequences in the Parliament House , and prove for them in one of their own expressions a dripping roast . Before I intervened , I think they were on the point of sharing out the different law appointments . Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some composition . "
65595	65601	65603	65603	he	182	" These are our friends , "
65605	65617	65603	65603	he	182	" And what were your reasons for dissenting , Mr. David ? "
65639	65648	65650	65650	he	182	" You do me no more than justice , "
65652	65677	65678	65678	he	182	" I have fought as hard in your interest as you have fought against mine . And how came you here to - day ? "
65681	65722	65678	65678	he	182	" As the case drew out , I began to grow uneasy that I had clipped the period so fine , and I was even expecting you to - morrow . But to - day I never dreamed of it . "
65734	65747	65749	65749	I.	0	" I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road , "
65750	65769	65771	65771	he	182	" If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer of the Bass , "
65773	65786	65788	65788	I	0	" Speaking of which , my lord , I return your letter . "
65798	65808	65810	65810	he	182	" There was the cover also with the seal , "
65812	65818	65820	65820	I.	0	" I have it not , "
65821	65853	65820	65820	I.	0	" It bore not even an address , and could not compromise a cat . The second enclosure I have , and with your permission , I desire to keep it . "
65869	65874	65875	65875	he	182	" To - morrow , "
65878	65908	65875	65875	he	182	" our business here is to be finished , and I proceed by Glasgow . I would be very glad to have you of my party , Mr David . "
65909	65915	65916	65916	I	0	" My lord . . . "
65919	65932	65933	65933	he	182	" I do not deny it will be of service to me , "
65936	66026	65933	65933	he	182	" I desire even that , when we shall come to Edinburgh , you should alight at my house . You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants , who will be overjoyed to have you to themselves . If you think I have been of use to you , you can thus easily repay me , and so far from losing , may reap some advantage by the way . It is not every strange young man who is presented in society by the King s Advocate . "
66255	66268	66270	66270	I.	0	" This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial ? "
66271	66279	66281	66281	he	3583	" You are cunning , Mr. David , "
66283	66330	66332	66332	he	3583	" and you do not wholly guess wrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence . Perhaps , however , you underrate friendly sentiments , which are perfectly genuine . I have a respect for you , David , mingled with awe , "
66336	66352	66354	66354	I.	0	" I am more than willing , I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes , "
66355	66468	66354	66354	I.	0	" It is my design to be called to the Bar , where your lordship s countenance would be invaluable ; and I am besides sincerely grateful to yourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence . The difficulty is here . There is one point in which we pull two ways . You are trying to hang James Stewart , I am trying to save him . In so far as my riding with you would better your lordship s defence , I am at your lordships orders ; but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart , you see me at a stick . "
66476	66493	66495	66495	he	1891	" You should certainly be called ; the Bar is the true scene for your talents , "
66506	66512	66513	66513	he	1891	" I will tell you , "
66517	66704	66513	66513	he	1891	" there is no question of James Stewart , for or against , James is a dead man ; his life is given and taken bought if you like it better and sold ; no memorial can help no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David hurt him . Blow high , blow low , there will be no pardon for James Stewart : and take that for said ! The question is now of myself : am I to stand or fall ? and I do not deny to you that I am in some danger . But will Mr. David Balfour consider why ? It is not because I pushed the case unduly against James ; for that , I am sure of condonation . And it is not because I have sequestered Mr. David on a rock , though it will pass under that colour ; but because I did not take the ready and plain path , to which I was pressed repeatedly , and send Mr. David to his grave or to the gallows . Hence the scandal hence this damned memorial , "
66712	66747	66513	66513	he	1891	" My tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty . I wish to know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you help me out of it . "
66826	66846	66849	66849	He	1892	" If you will name the time and place , I will be punctually ready to attend your lordship , "
66855	66867	66869	66869	he	1892	" And I think my misses have some news for you , "
67117	67188	67113	67113	Stewart	181	" If you had been successful in that rebellion , you might have been giving the law where you have now received the judgment of it ; we , who are this day your judges , might have been tried before one of your mock courts of judicature ; and then you might have been satiated with the blood of any name or clan to which you had an aversion . "
67189	67203	67205	67205	I.	0	" This is to let the cat out of the bag , indeed , "
67246	67255	67239	67239	someone	1908	" And then you might have been satiated . "
67279	67319	67320	67320	Another	473	" What do ye want the bluid of , bluid of ? Is it a name , or is it a clan , Or is it an aefauld Hielandman , That ye want the bluid of , bluid of ? "
67337	67360	67320	67320	Another	473	" It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench , That they served him a Stewart for his denner . "
67368	67411	67320	67320	Another	473	" Then up and spak the Duke , and flyted on his cook , I regard it as a sensible aspersion , That I would sup ava , an satiate my maw , With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion . "
67502	67516	67484	67485	a juryman	1917	" Pray , sir , cut it short , we are quite weary , "
67578	67593	67556	67556	His	1920	" James Drummond , alias Macgregor , alias James More , late tenant in Inveronachile "
68014	68021	67995	67995	I	0	" Ah , friend , friend , "
68028	68050	68022	68022	I	0	" if you were but through with this affair of the memorial , would you not kick me in the streets ? "
68252	68256	68249	68249	I	0	" one of themselves "
68319	68321	68323	68323	he	1939	" Why "
68325	68343	68323	68323	he	1939	" it was Miss Grant herself presented me ! My name is so - and - so . "
68344	68353	68355	68355	I	0	" It may very well be , sir , "
68357	68367	68355	68355	I	0	" but I have kept no mind of it . "
68484	68490	68491	68491	Himself	179	" soople to the laird . "
68524	68532	68534	68534	he	179	" I will take the word back , "
68536	68605	68534	68534	he	179	" But there is such a thing as Fair gude s en and fair gude day , Mr. David . These are the same young men with whom you are to pass your days and get through life : your backwardness has a look of arrogance ; and unless you can assume a little more lightness of manner , I fear you will meet difficulties in the path . "
68606	68624	68626	68626	I.	0	" It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow s ear , "
68687	68691	68693	68693	he	179	" Mr. David , "
68695	68732	68693	68693	he	179	" I have a piece of news for you . It concerns some friends of yours , of whom I sometimes think you are a little ashamed , for you have never referred to their existence . "
68738	68750	68752	68752	he	179	" See you understand , since you make the answering signal , "
68754	68885	68752	68752	he	179	" And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty . But do you know , Mr. David ? this seems to me a very enterprising lass . She crops up from every side . The Government of Scotland appears unable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond , which was somewhat the case no great while back with a certain Mr. David Balfour . Should not these make a good match ? Her first intromission in politics but I must not tell you that story , the authorities have decided you are to hear it otherwise and from a livelier narrator . This new example is more serious , however ; and I am afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in prison . "
68890	68893	68895	68895	he	1946	" Yes , "
68897	68932	68895	68895	he	1946	" the little lady is in prison . But I would not have you to despair . Unless you with your friends and memorials shall procure my downfall , she is to suffer nothing . "
68933	68945	68946	68946	I	0	" But what has she done ? What is her offence ? "
68949	68959	68960	68960	he	1946	" It might be almost construed a high treason , "
68963	68975	68960	68960	he	1946	" for she has broke the king s Castle of Edinburgh . "
68976	68984	68985	68985	I	0	" The lady is much my friend , "
68988	69002	68985	68985	I	0	" I know you would not mock me if the thing were serious . "
69003	69013	69015	69015	he	1946	" And yet it is serious in a sense , "
69017	69047	69015	69015	he	1946	" for this rogue of a Katrine or Cateran , as we may call her has set adrift again upon the world that very doubtful character , her papa . "
69223	69231	69211	69211	Whereupon	260	" Ah ! I was expecting that ! "
69232	69245	69247	69247	Prestongrange	182	" You have at times a great deal of discretion , too ! "
69249	69261	69262	69262	I	0	" And what is my lord pleased to mean by that ? "
69265	69270	69272	69272	he	182	" I was just marvelling "
69275	69798	69800	69800	Prestongrange	182	" that being so clever as to draw these inferences , you should not be clever enough to keep them to yourself . But I think you would like to hear the details of the affair . I have received two versions : and the least official is the more full and far the more entertaining , being from the lively pen of my eldest daughter . Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work , she writes , and what would make the thing more noted if it were only known the malefactor is a protĂŠgĂŠe of his lordship my papa . I am sure your heart is too much in your duty if it were nothing else to have forgotten Grey Eyes . What does she do , but get a broad hat with the flaps open , a long hairy - like man s greatcoat , and a big gravatt ; kilt her coats up to Gude kens whaur , clap two pair of boot - hose upon her legs , take a pair of clouted brogues 15 in her hand , and off to the Castle ! Here she gives herself out to be a soutar 16 in the employ of James More , and gets admitted to his cell , the lieutenant who seems to have been full of pleasantry making sport among his soldiers of the soutar s greatcoat . Presently they hear disputation and the sound of blows inside . Out flies the cobbler , his coat flying , the flaps of his hat beat about his face , and the lieutenant and his soldiers mock at him as he runs off . They laughed no so hearty the next time they had occasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall , pretty , grey - eyed lass in the female habit ! As for the cobbler , he was over the hills ayout Dumblane , and it s thought that poor Scotland will have to console herself without him . I drank Catriona s health this night in public . Indeed , the whole town admires her ; and I think the beaux would wear bits of her garters in their button - holes if they could only get them . I would have gone to visit her in prison too , only I remembered in time I was papa s daughter ; so I wrote her a billet instead , which I entrusted to the faithful Doig , and I hope you will admit I can be political when I please . The same faithful gomeral is to despatch this letter by the express along with those of the wiseacres , so that you may hear Tom Fool in company with Solomon . Talking of gomerals , do tell Dauvit Balfour . I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a long - legged lass in such a predicament ; to say nothing of the levities of your affectionate daughter , and his respectful friend . So my rascal signs herself ! "
69802	69830	69800	69800	Prestongrange	182	" And you see , Mr. David , it is quite true what I tell you , that my daughters regard you with the most affectionate playfulness . "
69831	69838	69840	69840	I.	1953	" The gomeral is much obliged , "
69841	69849	69850	69850	he	182	" And was not this prettily done ! "
69854	69866	69850	69850	he	182	" Is not this Highland maid a piece of a heroine ? "
69867	69878	69880	69880	I.	1953	" I was always sure she had a great heart , "
69881	69905	69880	69880	I.	1953	" And I wager she guessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon , this is to tread upon forbidden subjects . "
69906	69915	69916	69916	he	182	" I will go bail she did not , "
69922	69939	69916	69916	he	182	" I will go bail she thought she was flying straight into King George s face . "
70006	70017	70018	70018	I	0	" I am not your lordship s daughter . . . "
70021	70027	70028	70028	he	182	" That I know of ! "
70034	70041	70043	70043	I	0	" I speak like a fool , "
70045	70090	70043	70043	I	0	" or rather I began wrong . It would doubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison ; but for me , I think I would look like a half - hearted friend if I did not fly there instantly . "
70091	70099	70101	70101	he	182	" So - ho , Mr. David , "
70103	70115	70101	70101	he	182	" I thought that you and I were in a bargain ? "
70116	70120	70121	70121	I	0	" My lord , "
70124	70237	70121	70121	I	0	" when I made that bargain I was a good deal affected by your goodness , but I ll never can deny that I was moved besides by my own interest . There was self - seeking in my heart , and I think shame of it now . It may be for your lordship s safety to say this fashious Davie Balfour is your friend and housemate . Say it then ; I ll never contradict you . But as for your patronage , I give it all back . I ask but the one thing let me go , and give me a pass to see her in her prison . "
70247	70259	70261	70261	he	1954	" You put the cart before the horse , I think , "
70263	70306	70307	70307	He	1954	" That which I had given was a portion of my liking , which your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked . But for my patronage , it is not given , nor to be exact is it yet offered . "
70312	70324	70325	70325	he	1954	" And I warn you , you do not know yourself , "
70328	70346	70325	70325	he	1954	" Youth is a hasty season ; you will think better of all this before a year . "
70347	70361	70362	70362	I	0	" Well , and I would like to be that kind of youth ! "
70365	70454	70362	70362	I	0	" I have seen too much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me . And I have seen it in the old ones also . They are all for by - ends , the whole clan of them ! It s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship s liking . Why would I think that you would like me ? But ye told me yourself ye had an interest ! "
70477	70486	70487	70487	I	0	" My lord , I ask your pardon , "
70490	70557	70487	70487	I	0	" I have nothing in my chafts but a rough country tongue . I think it would be only decent - like if I would go to see my friend in her captivity ; but I m owing you my life I ll never forget that ; and if it s for your lordship s good , here I ll stay . That s barely gratitude . "
70558	70568	70570	70570	Prestongrange	182	" This might have been reached in fewer words , "
70573	70592	70570	70570	Prestongrange	182	" It is easy , and it is at times gracious , to say a plain Scots ay . "
70593	70610	70612	70612	I.	1956	" Ah , but , my lord , I think ye take me not yet entirely ! "
70613	70702	70612	70612	I.	1956	" For your sake , for my life - safe , and the kindness that ye say ye bear to me for these , I ll consent ; but not for any good that might be coming to myself . If I stand aside when this young maid is in her trial , it s a thing I will be noways advantaged by ; I will lose by it , I will never gain . I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that foundation . "
70712	70724	70726	70726	he	1957	" You mind me of the man with the long nose , "
70728	70836	70726	70726	he	1957	" was you to see the moon by a telescope you would see David Balfour there ! But you shall have your way of it . I will ask at you one service , and then set you free : My clerks are overdriven ; be so good as copy me these few pages , and when that is done , I shall bid you God speed ! I would never charge myself with Mr. David s conscience ; and if you could cast some part of it as you went by in a moss hag , you would find yourself to ride much easier without it . "
70837	70851	70853	70853	I.	1958	" Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though , my lord ! "
70854	70865	70867	70867	he	1959	" And you shall have the last word , too ! "
71259	71263	71265	71265	he	3161	" H m , "
71267	71290	71265	71265	he	3161	" ye come a wee thing ahint - hand , Mr. Balfour . The bird s flaen we hae letten her out . "
71291	71298	71299	71299	I	0	" Miss Drummond is set free ? "
71302	71305	71307	71307	he	3161	" Achy ! "
71309	71333	71307	71307	he	3161	" What would we keep her for , ye ken ? To hae made a steer about the bairn would has pleased naebody . "
71334	71342	71344	71344	I.	0	" And where ll she be now ? "
71345	71349	71351	71351	Doig	348	" Gude kens ! "
71357	71371	71373	71373	I.	0	" She ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce , I m thinking , "
71374	71380	71382	71382	he	3161	" That ll be it , "
71384	71392	71394	71394	I.	0	" Then I ll gang there straight , "
71395	71407	71409	71409	he	3161	" But ye ll be for a bite or ye go ? "
71411	71417	71419	71419	I.	0	" Neither bite nor sup , "
71420	71432	71419	71419	I.	0	" I had a good wauch of milk in by Ratho . "
71433	71438	71440	71440	Doig	348	" Aweel , aweel , "
71442	71467	71440	71440	Doig	348	" But ye ll can leave your horse here and your bags , for it seems we re to have your up - put . "
71468	71472	71475	71475	I.	0	" Na , na "
71476	71494	71475	71475	I.	0	" Tamson s mear 17 would never be the thing for me this day of all days . "
71553	71585	71586	71588	The young lady	3012	" Gae saddle me the bonny black , Gae saddle sune and mak him ready For I will down the Gatehope - slack , And a to see my bonny leddy . "
71637	71647	71649	71649	I	0	" My best respects to you , Mistress Grant , "
71653	71662	71663	71663	she	3012	" The like to yourself , Mr. David , "
71670	71737	71663	71663	she	3012	" And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw , that meat and mass never hindered man . The mass I can not afford you , for we are all good Protestants . But the meat I press on your attention . And I would not wonder but I could find something for your private ear that would be worth the stopping for . "
71738	71742	71744	71744	I	0	" Mistress Grant , "
71746	71772	71744	71744	I	0	" I believe I am already your debtor for some merry words and I think they were kind too on a piece of unsigned paper . "
71773	71777	71779	71779	she	1970	" Unsigned paper ? "
71800	71809	71810	71810	I	0	" Or else I am the more deceived , "
71814	71862	71810	71810	I	0	" But to be sure , we shall have the time to speak of these , since your father is so good as to make me for a while your inmate ; and the gomeral begs you at this time only for the favour of his liberty . "
71863	71870	71872	71872	she	1970	" You give yourself hard names , "
71874	71890	71892	71892	I.	0	" Mr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen , "
71893	71908	71909	71909	she	1970	" Once more I have to admire the discretion of all men - folk , "
71912	71949	71950	71950	she	1970	" But if you will not eat , off with you at once ; you will be back the sooner , for you go on a fool s errand . Off with you , Mr. David , "
71957	71991	71950	71950	she	1970	" He has lowpen on his bonny grey , He rade the richt gate and the ready I trow he would neither stint nor stay , For he was seeking his bonny leddy . "
72086	72095	72096	72096	she	1970	" What brings you to my poor door ? "
72105	72160	72161	72161	she	1970	" I can not bar it . The males of my house are dead and buried ; I have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me ; any beggar can pluck me by the baird 18 and a baird there is , and that s the worst of it yet ! "
72195	72208	72210	72210	I.	0	" I see I have fallen under your displeasure , ma am , "
72211	72225	72210	72210	I.	0	" Yet I will still be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond . "
72250	72255	72256	72256	she	1970	" This cows all ! "
72259	72274	72256	72256	she	1970	" Ye come to me to speir for her ? Would God I knew ! "
72275	72281	72282	72282	I	0	" She is not here ? "
72307	72314	72315	72315	she	1970	" Out upon your leeing throat ! "
72318	72389	72315	72315	she	1970	" What ! ye come and speir at me ! She s in jyle , whaur ye took her to that s all there is to it . And of a the beings ever I beheld in breeks , to think it should be to you ! Ye timmer scoun rel , if I had a male left to my name I would have your jaicket dustit till ye raired . "
72600	72617	72577	72577	she	1970	" He that will not when he may , When he will he shall have nay . "
72671	72691	72693	72693	she	1970	" Now , Mr. David , sit ye down here and let us have a two - handed crack , "
72695	72719	72693	72693	she	1970	" For I have much to tell you , and it appears besides that I have been grossly unjust to your good taste . "
72720	72728	72729	72729	I	0	" In what manner , Mistress Grant ? "
72732	72745	72729	72729	I	0	" I trust I have never seemed to fail in due respect . "
72746	72756	72758	72758	she	1970	" I will be your surety , Mr. David , "
72760	72795	72796	72796	she	1970	" Your respect , whether to yourself or your poor neighbours , has been always and most fortunately beyond imitation . But that is by the question . You got a note from me ? "
72799	72811	72813	72813	I	0	" I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference , "
72815	72823	72813	72813	I	0	" and it was kindly thought upon . "
72824	72832	72834	72834	she	1970	" It must have prodigiously surprised you , "
72836	72908	72834	72834	she	1970	" But let us begin with the beginning . You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so kind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park ? I have the less cause to forget it myself , because you was so particular obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar , a thing which wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude . "
72909	72917	72919	72919	I	0	" I fear I was sadly pedantical , "
72928	72944	72919	72919	I	0	" You are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of ladies . "
72945	72956	72957	72957	she	1970	" I will say the less about the grammar then , "
72960	72983	72984	72984	she	1970	" But how came you to desert your charge ? He has thrown her out , overboard , his ain dear Annie ! "
72987	73055	72984	72984	she	1970	" and his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese ! It seems you returned to my papa s , where you showed yourself excessively martial , and then on to realms unknown , with an eye it appears to the Bass Rock ; solan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses . "
73079	73088	73090	73090	I	0	" You take a pleasure to torment me , "
73092	73135	73090	73090	I	0	" and I make a very feckless plaything ; but let me ask you to be more merciful . At this time there is but the one thing that I care to hear of , and that will be news of Catriona . "
73136	73151	73152	73152	she	510	" Do you call her by that name to her face , Mr. Balfour ? "
73155	73166	73167	73167	I	0	" In troth , and I am not very sure , "
73170	73182	73184	73185	Miss Grant	234	" I would not do so in any case to strangers , "
73187	73203	73184	73185	Miss Grant	234	" And why are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady ? "
73204	73212	73214	73214	I.	0	" I heard she was in prison , "
73215	73229	73230	73230	she	510	" Well , and now you hear that she is out of it , "
73233	73250	73230	73230	she	510	" and what more would you have ? She has no need of any further champion . "
73251	73264	73266	73266	I.	0	" I may have the greater need of her , ma am , "
73267	73274	73276	73277	Miss Grant	234	" Come , this is better ! "
73279	73295	73276	73277	Miss Grant	234	" But look me fairly in the face ; am I not bonnier than she ? "
73296	73307	73309	73309	I.	0	" I would be the last to be denying it , "
73310	73320	73309	73309	I.	0	" There is not your marrow in all Scotland . "
73321	73344	73346	73346	she	510	" Well , here you have the pick of the two at your hand , and must needs speak of the other , "
73348	73362	73346	73346	she	510	" This is never the way to please the ladies , Mr. Balfour . "
73363	73368	73370	73370	I	0	" But , mistress , "
73372	73382	73370	73370	I	0	" there are surely other things besides mere beauty . "
73383	73402	73403	73403	she	510	" By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be , perhaps ? "
73406	73427	73429	73429	I.	0	" By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the midden in the fable book , "
73430	73454	73429	73429	I.	0	" I see the braw jewel and I like fine to see it too but I have more need of the pickle corn . "
73455	73458	73459	73459	she	510	" Bravissimo ! "
73462	73886	73459	73459	she	510	" There is a word well said at last , and I will reward you for it with my story . That same night of your desertion I came late from a friend s house where I was excessively admired , whatever you may think of it and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me ? She had been there an hour or better , said the servant - lass , and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting . I went to her direct ; she rose as I came in , and I knew her at a look . Grey Eyes ! says I to myself , but was more wise than to let on . You will be Miss Grant at last ? she says , rising and looking at me hard and pitiful . Ay , it was true he said , you are bonny at all events . The way God made me , my dear , I said , but I would be gey and obliged if you could tell me what brought you here at such a time of the night . Lady , she said , we are kinsfolk , we are both come of the blood of the sons of Alpin . My dear , I replied , I think no more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kalestock . You have a better argument in these tears upon your bonny face . And at that I was so weak - minded as to kiss her , which is what you would like to do dearly , and I wager will never find the courage of . I say it was weak - minded of me , for I knew no more of her than the outside ; but it was the wisest stroke I could have hit upon . She is a very staunch , brave nature , but I think she has been little used with tenderness ; and at that caress though to say the truth , it was but lightly given her heart went out to me . I will never betray the secrets of my sex , Mr. Davie ; I will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb , because it is the same she will use to twist yourself . Ay , it is a fine lass ! She is as clean as hill well water . "
73887	73894	73429	73429	I.	0	" She is e en t ! "
73898	73909	73459	73459	she	510	" Well , then , she told me her concerns , "
73914	74127	73459	73459	she	510	" and in what a swither she was in about her papa , and what a taking about yourself , with very little cause , and in what a perplexity she had found herself after you was gone away . And then I minded at long last , says she , that we were kinswomen , and that Mr. David should have given you the name of the bonniest of the bonny , and I was thinking to myself If she is so bonny she will be good at all events ; and I took up my foot soles out of that . That was when I forgave yourself , Mr. Davie . When you was in my society , you seemed upon hot iron : by all marks , if ever I saw a young man that wanted to be gone , it was yourself , and I and my two sisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from ; and now it appeared you had given me some notice in the by - going , and was so kind as to comment on my attractions ! From that hour you may date our friendship , and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar . "
74128	74139	74141	74141	I	0	" You will have many hours to rally me in , "
74143	74180	74141	74141	I	0	" and I think besides you do yourself injustice . I think it was Catriona turned your heart in my direction . She is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of her friend . "
74181	74194	74196	74196	she	1983	" I would not like to wager upon that , Mr. David , "
74198	74507	74196	74196	she	1983	" The lasses have clear eyes . But at least she is your friend entirely , as I was to see . I carried her in to his lordship my papa ; and his Advocacy being in a favourable stage of claret , was so good as to receive the pair of us . Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past , said I , she is come to prove that we spoke true , and I lay the prettiest lass in the three Lothians at your feet making a papistical reservation of myself . She suited her action to my words : down she went upon her knees to him I would not like to swear but he saw two of her , which doubtless made her appeal the more irresistible , for you are all a pack of Mahomedans told him what had passed that night , and how she had withheld her father s man from following of you , and what a case she was in about her father , and what a flutter for yourself ; and begged with weeping for the lives of both of you neither of which was in the slightest danger , till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done so pretty , and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion . She had not gone far , I assure you , before the Advocate was wholly sober , to see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of his daughters . But we took him in hand , the pair of us , and brought that matter straight . Properly managed and that means managed by me there is no one to compare with my papa . "
74508	74518	74520	74520	I.	1984	" He has been a good man to me , "
74521	74541	74543	74543	she	1985	" Well , he was a good man to Katrine , and I was there to see to it , "
74545	74552	74554	74554	I.	1984	" And she pled for me ? "
74555	74564	74566	74567	Miss Grant	234	" She did that , and very movingly , "
74569	74587	74566	74567	Miss Grant	234	" I would not like to tell you what she said I find you vain enough already . "
74588	74595	74597	74597	I.	1984	" God reward her for it ! "
74598	74607	74609	74609	she	1985	" With Mr. David Balfour , I suppose ? "
74611	74622	74566	74567	Miss Grant	234	" You do me too much injustice at the last ! "
74626	74789	74566	74567	Miss Grant	234	" I would tremble to think of her in such hard hands . Do you think I would presume , because she begged my life ? She would do that for a new whelped puppy ! I have had more than that to set me up , if you but ken d. She kissed that hand of mine . Ay , but she did . And why ? because she thought I was playing a brave part and might be going to my death . It was not for my sake but I need not be telling that to you , that can not look at me without laughter . It was for the love of what she thought was bravery . I believe there is none but me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour done them . Was this not to make a god of me ? and do you not think my heart would quake when I remember it ? "
74790	74810	74812	74812	she	1986	" I do laugh at you a good deal , and a good deal more than is quite civil , "
74814	74839	74812	74812	she	1986	" but I will tell you one thing : if you speak to her like that , you have some glimmerings of a chance . "
74840	74843	74566	74567	Miss Grant	234	" Me ? "
74847	74881	74883	74883	I.	0	" I would never dare . I can speak to you , Miss Grant , because it s a matter of indifference what ye think of me . But her ? no fear ! "
74884	74897	74899	74899	she	1986	" I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland , "
74901	74909	74911	74911	I	0	" Troth they are no very small , "
74916	74922	74924	74925	Miss Grant	234	" Ah , poor Catriona ! "
74967	74974	74975	74975	she	1986	" Ah well , Mr. David , "
74978	75076	74975	74975	she	1986	" it goes sore against my conscience , but I see I shall have to be your speaking board . She shall know you came to her straight upon the news of her imprisonment ; she shall know you would not pause to eat ; and of our conversation she shall hear just so much as I think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience . Believe me , you will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself , for I will keep the big feet out of the platter . "
75077	75086	75087	75087	I	0	" You know where she is , then ? "
75090	75103	75105	75105	she	1987	" That I do , Mr. David , and will never tell , "
75107	75111	75112	75112	I	0	" Why that ? "
75115	75118	75119	75119	she	1987	" Well , "
75122	75185	75119	75119	she	1987	" I am a good friend , as you will soon discover ; and the chief of those that I am friend to is my papa . I assure you , you will never heat nor melt me out of that , so you may spare me your sheep s eyes ; and adieu to your David - Balfourship for the now . "
75186	75195	75196	75196	I	0	" But there is yet one thing more , "
75199	75220	75196	75196	I	0	" There is one thing that must be stopped , being mere ruin to herself , and to me too . "
75221	75224	75225	75225	she	1987	" Well , "
75228	75242	75225	75225	she	1987	" be brief ; I have spent half the day on you already . "
75243	75249	75250	75250	I	0	" My Lady Allardyce believes , "
75252	75262	75250	75250	I	0	" she supposes she thinks that I abducted her . "
75315	75326	75327	75327	she	234	" I will take up the defence of your reputation , "
75330	75339	75327	75327	she	234	" You may leave it in my hands . "
76036	76042	76044	76044	I	0	" There is my home , "
76046	76051	76044	76044	I	0	" and my family . "
76052	76057	76059	76060	Miss Grant	234	" Poor David Balfour ! "
76095	76109	76111	76111	he	182	" I think you will soon be the laird indeed , Mr. Davie , "
76124	76131	76133	76133	I	0	" I will never pretend sorrow , "
76413	76424	76426	76426	I	0	" Is this all the welcome I am to get ? "
76433	76444	76426	76426	I	0	" And have you no more memory of old friends ? "
76445	76455	76456	76456	she	3012	" Keep me ! wha s this of it ? "
76462	76474	76456	76456	she	3012	" God s truth , it s the tautit 19 laddie ! "
76475	76480	76482	76482	I.	0	" The very same , "
76483	76507	76509	76509	she	3012	" Mony s the time I ve thocht upon you and your freen , and blythe am I to see in your braws , "
76512	76542	76509	76509	she	3012	" Though I kent ye were come to your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that I thank ye for with a my heart . "
76543	76546	76548	76549	Miss Grant	234	" There , "
76553	76586	76548	76549	Miss Grant	234	" run out by with ye , like a guid bairn . I didnae come here to stand and haud a candle ; it s her and me that are to crack . "
76629	76638	76640	76640	I.	0	" I never saw you so well adorned , "
76641	76652	76654	76654	she	3012	" O Davie man , dinna be a pompous gowk ! "
76869	76880	76882	76882	I	0	" I have said nothing you can properly object to , "
76884	76900	76882	76882	I	0	" and as for my knees , that is an attitude I keep for God . "
76901	76912	76913	76913	she	3012	" And as a goddess I am to be served ! "
76928	76943	76913	76913	she	3012	" Every man that comes within waft of my petticoats shall use me so ! "
76944	76968	76969	76969	I	0	" I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion s sake , although I vow I know not why , "
76972	76987	76969	76969	I	0	" But for these play - acting postures , you can go to others . "
76988	76992	76993	76993	she	3012	" O Davie ! "
76996	77005	76993	76993	she	3012	" Not if I was to beg you ? "
77034	77042	77043	77043	I	0	" I think it a bairnly thing , "
77046	77068	77070	77070	I	0	" not worthy in you to ask , or me to render . Yet I will not refuse you , neither , "
77072	77086	77070	77070	I	0	" and the stain , if there be any , rests with yourself . "
77095	77098	77099	77099	she	3012	" There ! "
77102	77120	77099	77099	she	3012	" There is the proper station , there is where I have been manoeuvring to bring you . "
77126	77129	77132	77132	she	3012	" Kep , "
77155	77160	77132	77132	she	3012	" Dear Mr. David , "
77164	77281	77132	77132	she	3012	" I get your news continually by my cousin , Miss Grant , and it is a pleisand hearing . I am very well , in a good place , among good folk , but necessitated to be quite private , though I am hoping that at long last we may meet again . All your friendships have been told me by my loving cousin , who loves us both . She bids me to send you this writing , and oversees the same . I will be asking you to do all her commands , and rest your affectionate friend , Catriona Macgregor - Drummond . P.S. Will you not see my cousin , Allardyce ? "
77576	77579	77580	77580	she	234	" No , "
77588	77602	77580	77580	she	234	" I am going to keep the big feet out of the platter . "
77636	77641	77633	77633	she	234	" had behaved myself . "
77888	77893	77894	77894	she	234	" Here , Shaws ! "
77897	77911	77894	77894	she	234	" keek out of the window and see what I have broughten you . "
77968	77971	77973	77974	Miss Grant	234	" There ! "
77976	78013	77973	77974	Miss Grant	234	" I wanted her to see you in your braws like the lass of Limekilns . I wanted her to see what I could make of you , when I buckled to the job in earnest ! "
78066	78069	78072	78072	I	0	" Catriona ! "
78309	78317	78319	78319	she	234	" I am sorry you was disappointed , "
78322	78371	78373	78373	she	234	" For my part I was very pleased . You looked better than I dreaded ; you looked if it will not make you vain a mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the window . You are to remember that she could not see your feet , "
78383	78386	78388	78388	I	0	" O ! "
78390	78403	78388	78388	I	0	" leave my feet be they are no bigger than my neighbours . "
78404	78412	78414	78414	she	234	" They are even smaller than some , "
78416	78427	78414	78414	she	234	" but I speak in parables like a Hebrew prophet . "
78428	78437	78439	78439	I.	0	" I marvel little they were sometimes stoned ! "
78440	78464	78439	78439	I.	0	" But , you miserable girl , how could you do it ? Why should you care to tantalise me with a moment ? "
78465	78471	78473	78473	she	234	" Love is like folk , "
78475	78483	78473	78473	she	234	" it needs some kind of vivers . "
78485	78496	78497	78497	I	0	" Oh , Barbara , let me see her properly ! "
78500	78517	78497	78497	I	0	" You can you see her when you please ; let me have half an hour . "
78518	78534	78535	78535	she	234	" Who is it that is managing this love affair ! You ! Or me ? "
79095	79104	79105	79105	she	2999	" Have I not given you my advice ? "
79108	79114	79116	79116	I	0	" I know you have , "
79118	79160	79116	79116	I	0	" and I know how much I am beholden to you already , and that I am bidden to obey your orders . But you must confess you are something too merry a lass at times to lippen 23 to entirely . "
79161	79169	79171	79171	she	2999	" I will tell you , then , "
79173	79223	79171	79171	she	2999	" Be you on board by nine o clock forenoon ; the ship does not sail before one ; keep your boat alongside ; and if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send them , you can come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself . "
79383	79392	79394	79394	she	2999	" You forget yourself strangely , Mr. Balfour , "
79396	79416	79394	79394	she	2999	" I can not call to mind that I have given you any right to presume on our acquaintancy . "
79460	79465	79466	79466	she	2999	" You inimitable bairn ! "
79469	79604	79466	79466	she	2999	" Did you think that I would let us part like strangers ? Because I can never keep my gravity at you five minutes on end , you must not dream I do not love you very well : I am all love and laughter , every time I cast an eye on you ! And now I will give you an advice to conclude your education , which you will have need of before it s very long . Never ask womenfolk . They re bound to answer No ; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation . It s supposed by divines to be the curse of Eve : because she did not say it when the devil offered her the apple , her daughters can say nothing else . "
79605	79617	79618	79618	I	0	" Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor , "
79621	79628	79630	79630	she	2114	" This is gallant , indeed , "
79633	79641	79642	79642	I	0	" I would put the one question , "
79646	79657	79642	79642	I	0	" May I ask a lass to marry to me ? "
79658	79668	79669	79669	she	2114	" You think you could not marry her without ! "
79672	79680	79669	79669	she	2114	" Or else get her to offer ? "
79681	79690	79692	79692	I.	0	" You see you can not be serious , "
79693	79705	79707	79707	she	2114	" I shall be very serious in one thing , David , "
79709	79717	79707	79707	she	2114	" I shall always be your friend . "
80331	80343	80344	80344	she	2136	" O , why will not Baby have been telling me ! "
80382	80476	80371	80371	Within	362	" Dear Davie , What do you think of my farewell ? and what do you say to your fellow passenger ? Did you kiss , or did you ask ? I was about to have signed here , but that would leave the purport of my question doubtful , and in my own case I ken the answer . So fill up here with good advice . Do not be too blate , 25 and for God s sake do not try to be too forward ; nothing acts you worse . I am
80477	80484	80485	80486	Barbara Grant	234	" Your affectionate friend and governess , "
80488	80488	80485	80486	Barbara Grant	234	"
80577	80580	80582	80582	I.	0	" Catriona ? "
80596	80606	80608	80608	she	189	" You will be glad to see me again ? "
80610	80620	80622	80622	I.	0	" And I think that is an idle word , "
80623	80636	80622	80622	I.	0	" We are too deep friends to make speech upon such trifles . "
80637	80648	80649	80649	she	189	" Is she not the girl of all the world ? "
80653	80667	80649	80649	she	189	" I was never knowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful . "
80668	80687	80689	80689	I.	0	" And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a kale - stock , "
80690	80699	80701	80701	Catriona	189	" Ah , she will say so indeed ! "
80703	80727	80701	80701	Catriona	189	" Yet it was for the name and the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good to me . "
80728	80739	80741	80741	I.	0	" Well , I will tell you why it was , "
80742	80847	80741	80741	I.	0	" There are all sorts of people s faces in this world . There is Barbara s face , that everyone must look at and admire , and think her a fine , brave , merry girl . And then there is your face , which is quite different I never knew how different till to - day . You can not see yourself , and that is why you do not understand ; but it was for the love of your face that she took you up and was so good to you . And everybody in the world would do the same . "
80848	80851	80853	80853	she	2150	" Everybody ? "
80855	80860	80862	80862	I.	2151	" Every living soul ! "
80863	80881	80882	80882	she	2150	" Ah , then , that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up ! "
80885	80895	80897	80897	I.	2151	" Barbara has been teaching you to catch me , "
80898	80942	80943	80943	she	2150	" She will have taught me more than that at all events . She will have taught me a great deal about Mr. David all the ill of him , and a little that was not so ill either , now and then , "
80948	80980	80943	80943	she	2150	" She will have told me all there was of Mr. David , only just that he would sail upon this very same ship . And why it is you go ? "
80985	80990	80992	80992	she	2150	" Ah , well , "
80994	81043	80992	80992	she	2150	" we will be some days in company and then I suppose good - bye for altogether ! I go to meet my father at a place of the name of Helvoetsluys , and from there to France , to be exiles by the side of our chieftain . "
81051	81054	81067	81067	She	2150	" O ! "
81083	81099	81101	81101	she	2150	" There is one thing I must be saying first of all , Mr. David , "
81103	81251	81101	81101	she	2150	" I think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether very well . And the one of them two is James More , my father , and the other is the Laird of Prestongrange . Prestongrange will have spoken by himself , or his daughter in the place of him . But for James More , my father , I have this much to say : he lay shackled in a prison ; he is a plain honest soldier and a plain Highland gentleman ; what they would be after he would never be guessing ; but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice to a young gentleman like yourself , he would have died first . And for the sake of all your friendships , I will be asking you to pardon my father and family for that same mistake . "
81252	81255	81257	81257	I	0	" Catriona , "
81259	81377	81257	81257	I	0	" what that mistake was I do not care to know . I know but the one thing that you went to Prestongrange and begged my life upon your knees . O , I ken well enough it was for your father that you went , but when you were there you pleaded for me also . It is a thing I can not speak of . There are two things I can not think of into myself : and the one is your good words when you called yourself my little friend , and the other that you pleaded for my life . Let us never speak more , we two , of pardon or offence . "
82347	82357	82359	82359	she	2190	" It is not much that I have done , "
82361	82840	82359	82359	she	2190	" and I could be telling you the five - fifths of it in two - three words . It is only a girl I am , and what can befall a girl , at all events ? But I went with the clan in the year 45 . The men marched with swords and fire - locks , and some of them in brigades in the same set of tartan ; they were not backward at the marching , I can tell you . And there were gentlemen from the Low Country , with their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound , and there was a grand skirling of war - pipes . I rode on a little Highland horse on the right hand of my father , James More , and of Glengyle himself . And here is one fine thing that I remember , that Glengyle kissed me in the face , because says he my kinswoman , you are the only lady of the clan that has come out , and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old ! I saw Prince Charlie too , and the blue eyes of him ; he was pretty indeed ! I had his hand to kiss in front of the army . O , well , these were the good days , but it is all like a dream that I have seen and then awakened . It went what way you very well know ; and these were the worst days of all , when the red - coat soldiers were out , and my father and uncles lay in the hill , and I was to be carrying them their meat in the middle night , or at the short sight of day when the cocks crow . Yes , I have walked in the night , many s the time , and my heart great in me for terror of the darkness . It is a strange thing I will never have been meddled with by a bogle ; but they say a maid goes safe . Next there was my uncle s marriage , and that was a dreadful affair beyond all . Jean Kay was that woman s name ; and she had me in the room with her that night at Inversnaid , the night we took her from her friends in the old , ancient manner . She would and she wouldn t ; she was for marrying Rob the one minute , and the next she would be for none of him . I will never have seen such a feckless creature of a woman ; surely all there was of her would tell her ay or no . Well , she was a widow ; and I can never be thinking a widow a good woman . "
82841	82844	82846	82846	I	0	" Catriona ! "
82848	82856	82846	82846	I	0	" how do you make out that ? "
82857	82863	82865	82865	she	2191	" I do not know , "
82867	83016	82865	82865	she	2191	" I am only telling you the seeming in my heart . And then to marry a new man ! Fy ! But that was her ; and she was married again upon my Uncle Robin , and went with him awhile to kirk and market ; and then wearied , or else her friends got claught of her and talked her round , or maybe she turned ashamed ; at the least of it , she ran away , and went back to her own folk , and said we had held her in the lake , and I will never tell you all what . I have never thought much of any females since that day . And so in the end my father , James More , came to be cast in prison , and you know the rest of it an well as me . "
83017	83026	83028	83028	I.	2192	" And through all you had no friends ? "
83029	83032	83034	83034	she	2193	" No , "
83036	83058	83034	83034	she	2193	" I have been pretty chief with two - three lasses on the braes , but not to call it friends . "
83059	83068	83070	83070	I.	2192	" Well , mine is a plain tale , "
83071	83087	83070	83070	I.	2192	" I never had a friend to my name till I met in with you . "
83088	83095	83096	83096	she	2193	" And that brave Mr. Stewart ? "
83099	83109	83110	83110	I	0	" O , yes , I was forgetting him , "
83113	83126	83110	83110	I	0	" But he is a man , and that in very different . "
83127	83133	83135	83135	she	2193	" I would think so , "
83137	83147	83135	83135	she	2193	" O , yes , it is quite different . "
83148	83156	83158	83158	I.	0	" And then there was one other , "
83159	83174	83158	83158	I.	0	" I once thought I had a friend , but it proved a disappointment . "
83182	83190	83192	83192	I.	0	" It was a he , then , "
83193	83299	83192	83192	I.	0	" We were the two best lads at my father s school , and we thought we loved each other dearly . Well , the time came when he went to Glasgow to a merchant s house , that was his second cousin once removed ; and wrote me two - three times by the carrier ; and then he found new friends , and I might write till I was tired , he took no notice . Eh , Catriona , it took me a long while to forgive the world . There is not anything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend . "
83353	83359	83361	83361	I	0	" Here are his letters , "
83363	83396	83361	83361	I	0	" and all the letters that ever I got . That will be the last I ll can tell of myself ; ye know the lave 26 as well as I do . "
83397	83407	83409	83409	she	2194	" Will you let me read them , then ? "
83721	83727	83729	83729	I	0	" You have read them ? "
83754	83763	83764	83764	she	3036	" Did you mean me to read all ? "
83770	83773	83767	83767	I	0	" Yes , "
83779	83787	83789	83789	she	3036	" The last of them as well ? "
83807	83815	83816	83816	I	0	" I gave them all without afterthought , "
83819	83836	83816	83816	I	0	" as I supposed that you would read them . I see no harm in any . "
83837	83844	83846	83846	she	3036	" I will be differently made , "
83848	83876	83846	83846	she	3036	" I thank God I am differently made . It was not a fit letter to be shown me . It was not fit to be written . "
83877	83891	83893	83893	I.	0	" I think you are speaking of your own friend , Barbara Grant ? "
83894	83909	83911	83911	she	3036	" There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend , "
83918	83930	83931	83931	I	0	" I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied ! "
83934	83980	83931	83931	I	0	" What kind of justice do you call this , to blame me for some words that a tomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper ? You know yourself with what respect I have behaved and would do always . "
83981	83991	83993	83993	she	3036	" Yet you would show me that same letter ! "
83995	84017	83993	83993	she	3036	" I want no such friends . I can be doing very well , Mr. Balfour , without her or you . "
84018	84025	84027	84027	I.	0	" This is your fine gratitude ! "
84028	84037	84039	84039	she	3036	" I am very much obliged to you , "
84041	84053	84054	84054	She	3036	" I will be asking you to take away your letters . "
84070	84077	84079	84079	I	0	" You shall never ask twice , "
84483	84493	84495	84495	I	0	" I have no guess how I have offended , "
84497	84516	84495	84495	I	0	" it should scarce be beyond pardon , then . O , try if you can pardon me . "
84517	84525	84527	84527	she	3036	" I have no pardon to give , "
84542	84554	84556	84556	she	3036	" I will be very much obliged for all your friendships . "
84585	84591	84593	84593	I.	0	" There is one thing , "
84594	84647	84593	84593	I.	0	" If I have shocked your particularity by the showing of that letter , it can not touch Miss Grant . She wrote not to you , but to a poor , common , ordinary lad , who might have had more sense than show it . If you are to blame me "
84648	84665	84667	84667	Catriona	189	" I will advise you to say no more about that girl , at all events ! "
84669	84687	84688	84688	She	189	" It is her I will never look the road of , not if she lay dying . "
84698	84712	84713	84713	she	189	" Will you swear you will have no more to deal with her ? "
84716	84728	84730	84730	I	0	" Indeed , and I will never be so unjust then , "
84732	84738	84730	84730	I	0	" nor yet so ungrateful . "
85145	85149	85151	85151	he	181	" Your father , "
85153	85188	85190	85190	he	181	" would be gey an little pleased if we was to break a leg to ye , Miss Drummond , let - a - be drowning of you . Take my way of it , "
85192	85244	85151	85151	he	181	" and come on - by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam . Ye can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the Brill , and thence on again , by a place in a rattel - waggon , back to Helvoet . "
85302	85315	85317	85317	her	189	" My father , James More , will have arranged it so , "
85432	85443	85445	85445	one	503	" But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither , "
85447	85453	85455	85455	she	189	" It is very true , "
85457	85484	85455	85455	she	189	" but since the year 46 there are so many of the honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well . I thank you . "
85679	85692	85694	85694	I.	0	" I will go ashore with the young lady , Captain Sang , "
85695	85707	85694	85694	I.	0	" It is all one what way I go to Leyden ; "
86217	86232	86234	86234	she	189	" Do you think I will have come on board and not ask first ? "
86348	86367	86369	86369	she	189	" He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott , an honest Scotch merchant , "
86378	86395	86369	86369	she	189	" I am wishing to thank you very much you are a brave friend to me . "
86396	86410	86412	86412	I	0	" It will be time enough when I get you to your father , "
86422	86435	86412	86412	I	0	" I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal daughter . "
86436	86454	86455	86455	she	189	" O , I do not think I will be a loyal girl , at all events , "
86468	86478	86455	86455	she	189	" I do not think my heart is true . "
86479	86501	86502	86502	I	0	" Yet there are very few that would have made that leap , and all to obey a father s orders , "
86505	86518	86519	86519	she	189	" I can not have you to be thinking of me so , "
86523	86548	86519	86519	she	189	" When you had done that same , how would I stop behind ? And at all events that was not all the reasons . "
86566	86571	86573	86573	I	0	" Good guide us ! "
86575	86608	86609	86609	I	0	" what kind of daft - like proceeding is this , to let yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with an empty purse I count it hardly decent scant decent ! "
86612	86626	86628	86628	she	189	" You forget James More , my father , is a poor gentleman , "
86630	86637	86628	86628	she	189	" He is a hunted exile . "
86638	86650	86651	86651	I	0	" But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles , "
86654	86763	86764	86764	I	0	" And was this fair to them that care for you ? Was it fair to me ? was it fair to Miss Grant that counselled you to go , and would be driven fair horn - mad if she could hear of it ? Was it even fair to these Gregory folk that you were living with , and used you lovingly ? It s a blessing you have fallen in my hands ! Suppose your father hindered by an accident , what would become of you here , and you your lee - lone in a strange place ? The thought of the thing frightens me , "
86767	86777	86778	86778	she	2300	" I will have lied to all of them , "
86781	86808	86778	86778	she	2300	" I will have told them all that I had plenty . I told her too . I could not be lowering James More to them . "
86887	86894	86896	86896	I	0	" Well , well , well , "
86898	86907	86896	86896	I	0	" you will have to learn more sense . "
87092	87103	87105	87105	I.	2321	" Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet , sir ? "
87106	87115	87117	87117	he	315	" I ken nobody by such a name , "
87123	87130	87132	87132	I	0	" Since you are so particular , "
87134	87167	87132	87132	I	0	" I will amend my question , and ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond , alias Macgregor , alias James More , late tenant in Inveronachile ? "
87168	87171	87173	87173	he	315	" Sir , "
87175	87195	87173	87173	he	315	" he may be in Hell for what I ken , and for my part I wish he was . "
87196	87208	87210	87210	I	0	" The young lady is that gentleman s daughter , sir , "
87212	87234	87210	87210	I	0	" before whom , I think you will agree with me , it is not very becoming to discuss his character . "
87235	87251	87253	87253	he	315	" I have nothing to make either with him , or her , or you ! "
87259	87267	87269	87269	I	0	" Under your favour , Mr. Sprott , "
87271	87333	87269	87269	I	0	" this young lady is come from Scotland seeking him , and by whatever mistake , was given the name of your house for a direction . An error it seems to have been , but I think this places both you and me who am but her fellow - traveller by accident under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman . "
87334	87341	87342	87342	he	315	" Will you ding me daft ? "
87345	87371	87342	87342	he	315	" I tell ye I ken naething and care less either for him or his breed . I tell ye the man owes me money . "
87372	87381	87383	87383	I	0	" That may very well be , sir , "
87394	87430	87383	87383	I	0	" At least , I owe you nothing ; the young lady is under my protection ; and I am neither at all used with these manners , nor in the least content with them . "
87482	87494	87495	87495	he	315	" For the Lord s sake dinna be hasty , sir ! "
87498	87584	87495	87495	he	315	" I am truly wishfu no to be offensive . But ye ken , sir , I m like a wheen guid - natured , honest , canty auld fellows my bark is waur nor my bite . To hear me , ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour ; but na , na ! it s a kind auld fallow at heart , Sandie Sprott ! And ye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me . "
87585	87591	87593	87593	I.	2323	" Very good , sir , "
87594	87616	87593	87593	I.	2323	" Then I will make that much freedom with your kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond . "
87617	87624	87626	87626	he	2324	" You re welcome , sir ! "
87628	87899	87626	87626	he	2324	" As for the young leddy my respects to her ! , he ll just have clean forgotten her . I ken the man , ye see ; I have lost siller by him ere now . He thinks of naebody but just himsel ; clan , king , or dauchter , if he can get his wameful , he would give them a the go - by ! ay , or his correspondent either . For there is a sense in whilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent . The fact is , we are employed thegether in a business affair , and I think it s like to turn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott . The man s as guid s my pairtner , and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is . He micht be coming here to Helvoet ; he micht come here the morn , he michtnae come for a twalmouth ; I would wonder at naething or just at the ae thing , and that s if he was to pay me my siller . Ye see what way I stand with it ; and it s clear I m no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy , as ye ca her . She cannae stop here , that s ae thing certain sure . Dod , sir , I m a lone man ! If I was to tak her in , its highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up . "
87900	87906	87908	87908	I.	2325	" Enough of this talk , "
87909	87959	87908	87908	I.	2325	" I will take the young leddy among better friends . Give me , pen , ink , and paper , and I will leave here for James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden . He can inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter . "
88107	88110	88112	88112	I	0	" Now , "
88114	88161	88112	88112	I	0	" let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the French , have a piece of dinner , and inquire for conveyances to Rotterdam . I will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs. Gebbie . "
88162	88171	88173	88173	Catriona	189	" I suppose it will have to be , "
88175	88210	88173	88173	Catriona	189	" though whoever will be pleased , I do not think it will be her . And I will remind you this once again that I have but one shilling , and three baubees . "
88211	88218	88220	88220	I	0	" And just this once again , "
88222	88238	88220	88220	I	0	" I will remind you it was a blessing that I came alongst with you . "
88239	88250	88252	88252	she	189	" What else would I be thinking all this time ? "
88264	88276	88252	88252	she	189	" It is you that are the good friend to me . "
88534	88541	88543	88543	I	0	" We shall be doing now , "
88552	88586	88543	88543	I	0	" Let us walk here by the harbour . We are sure to meet some that has the English , and at the best of it we may light upon that very ship . "
88898	88905	88906	88906	she	3012	" Take me away , David , "
88909	88921	88906	88906	she	3012	" You keep me . I am not afraid with you . "
88922	88932	88934	88934	I	0	" And have no cause , my little friend ! "
88947	88955	88956	88956	she	3012	" Where will you be taking me ? "
88960	88972	88956	88956	she	3012	" Don t leave me at all events never leave me . "
88973	88981	88983	88983	I	0	" Where am I taking you to ? "
88997	89032	88983	88983	I	0	" I must stop and think . But I ll not leave you , Catriona ; the Lord do so to me , and more also , if I should fail or fash you . "
89044	89047	89048	89048	I	0	" Here , "
89051	89083	89048	89048	I	0	" is the stillest place we have hit on yet in this busy byke of a city . Let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our course . "
89338	89347	89349	89349	she	3012	" You will have thought of something good , "
89430	89433	89435	89435	I	0	" Catriona , "
89437	89462	89435	89435	I	0	" I know you re brave and I believe you re strong do you think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road ? "
89487	89490	89491	89491	she	2374	" David , "
89494	89540	89491	89491	she	2374	" if you will just keep near , I will go anywhere and do anything . The courage of my heart , it is all broken . Do not be leaving me in this horrible country by myself , and I will do all else . "
89541	89551	89553	89553	I.	0	" Can you start now and march all night ? "
89554	89566	89567	89567	she	2374	" I will do all that you can ask of me , "
89570	89610	89611	89611	she	2374	" and never ask you why . I have been a bad ungrateful girl to you ; and do what you please with me now ! And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the world , "
89614	89630	89611	89611	she	2374	" and I do not see what she would deny you for at all events . "
89749	89754	89756	89756	I	0	" Well , Catriona , "
89758	89799	89756	89756	I	0	" here we are like the king s sons and the old wives daughters in your daft - like Highland tales . Soon we ll be going over the seven Bens , the seven glens and the seven mountain moors . "
89819	89822	89824	89824	she	2380	" Ah , "
89826	89864	89824	89824	she	2380	" but here are no glens or mountains ! Though I will never be denying but what the trees and some of the plain places hereabouts are very pretty . But our country is the best yet . "
89865	89878	89880	89880	I	0	" I wish we could say as much for our own folk , "
89893	89905	89907	89907	she	2381	" I will never complain of the country of my friend , "
89947	89958	89960	89960	I	0	" I do not know what you think , Catriona , "
89969	90009	89960	89960	I	0	" but this has been the best day yet ! I think shame to say it , when you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours ; but for me , it has been the best day yet . "
90010	90024	90026	90026	she	2381	" It was a good day when you showed me so much love , "
90028	90039	90040	90040	I	0	" And yet I think shame to be happy too , "
90044	90056	90040	90040	I	0	" and you here on the road in the black night . "

90086	90094	90095	90095	I	0	" I am quite forgiven , then ? "
90098	90118	90119	90119	she	2381	" Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your mouth again ? "
90122	90141	90142	90142	she	2381	" There is nothing in this heart to you but thanks . But I will be honest too , "
90151	90161	90142	90142	she	2381	" and I ll never can forgive that girl . "
90162	90169	90171	90171	I.	0	" Is this Miss Grant again ? "
90172	90185	90142	90142	she	2381	" You said yourself she was the best lady in the world . "
90186	90194	90196	90196	Catriona	189	" So she will be , indeed ! "
90198	90227	90196	90196	Catriona	189	" But I will never forgive her for all that . I will never , never forgive her , and let me hear tell of her no more . "
90228	90231	90233	90233	I	0	" Well , "
90235	90307	90233	90233	I	0	" this beats all that ever came to my knowledge ; and I wonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims . Here is a young lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us , that learned us how to dress ourselves , and in a great manner how to behave , as anyone can see that knew us both before and after . "
90319	90327	90329	90329	she	189	" It is this way of it , "
90331	90374	90329	90329	she	189	" Either you will go on to speak of her , and I will go back to yon town , and let come of it what God pleases ! Or else you will do me that politeness to talk of other things . "
90426	90431	90433	90433	I	0	" My dear girl , "
90435	90542	90433	90433	I	0	" I can make neither head nor tails of this ; but God forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee . As for talking of Miss Grant , I have no such a mind to it , and I believe it was yourself began it . My only design if I took you up at all was for your own improvement , for I hate the very look of injustice . Not that I do not wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy ; they become you well ; but here you show them to excess . "
90543	90552	90554	90554	she	2387	" Well , then , have you done ? "
90556	90561	90563	90563	I.	2388	" I have done , "
90564	90570	90572	90572	she	2387	" A very good thing , "
90726	90736	90738	90738	I.	0	" Indeed and I will do no such thing , "
90739	90779	90738	90738	I.	0	" Here am I , a great , ugly lad that has seen all kinds of weather , and here are you a tender , pretty maid ! My dear , you would not put me to a shame ? "
90814	90826	90831	90831	she	2387	" You must try to be more patient of your friend , "
90852	90862	90864	90864	she	2387	" There will be no end to your goodness , "
90972	90975	90977	90977	I	0	" Catriona , "
90979	90991	90977	90977	I	0	" I believe you have yet a shilling and three baubees ? "
90992	90998	91000	91000	she	2387	" Are you wanting it ? "
91008	91024	91000	91000	she	2387	" I am wishing it was five pounds ! What will you want it for ? "
91025	91043	91045	91045	I.	0	" And what have we been walking for all night , like a pair of waif Egyptians ! "
91046	91119	91045	91045	I.	0	" Just because I was robbed of my purse and all I possessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam . I will tell you of it now , because I think the worst is over , but we have still a good tramp before us till we get to where my money is , and if you would not buy me a piece of bread , I were like to go fasting . "
91163	91172	91173	91173	she	2387	" My torture ! are we beggars then ! "
91176	91249	91173	91173	she	2387	" You too ? O , I could have wished for this same thing ! And I am glad to buy your breakfast to you . But it would be pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to you ! For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of dancing over here , and might be paying for the curiosity of that sight . "
91371	91377	91379	91379	she	2387	" And now , Davie , "
91381	91392	91379	91379	she	2387	" what will you do with me at all events ? "
91393	91403	91405	91405	I	0	" It is what we have to speak of , "
91407	91457	91405	91405	I	0	" and the sooner yet the better . I can come by money in Leyden ; that will be all well . But the trouble is how to dispose of you until your father come . I thought last night you seemed a little sweir to part from me ? "
91458	91467	91469	91469	she	2387	" It will be more than seeming then , "
91471	91479	91481	91481	I	0	" You are a very young maid , "
91483	91519	91481	91481	I	0	" and I am but a very young callant . This is a great piece of difficulty . What way are we to manage ? Unless indeed , you could pass to be my sister ? "
91520	91526	91528	91528	she	2387	" And what for no ? "
91530	91537	91528	91528	she	2387	" if you would let me ! "
91538	91547	91548	91548	I	0	" I wish you were so , indeed , "
91551	91575	91548	91548	I	0	" I would be a fine man if I had such a sister . But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond . "
91576	91585	91586	91586	she	2387	" And now I will be Catriona Balfour , "
91589	91603	91586	91586	she	2387	" And who is to ken ? They are all strange folk here . "
91604	91613	91615	91615	I.	0	" If you think that it would do , "
91616	91638	91615	91615	I.	0	" I own it troubles me . I would like it very ill , if I advised you at all wrong . "
91639	91650	91651	91651	she	2387	" David , I have no friend here but you , "
91654	91669	91671	91671	I.	0	" The mere truth is , I am too young to be your friend , "
91672	91705	91671	91671	I.	0	" I am too young to advise you , or you to be advised . I see not what else we are to do , and yet I ought to warn you . "
91706	91714	91716	91716	she	2387	" I will have no choice left , "
91718	91776	91777	91777	she	2387	" My father James More has not used me very well , and it is not the first time , I am cast upon your hands like a sack of barley meal , and have nothing else to think of but your pleasure . If you will have me , good and well . If you will not "
91786	91793	91795	91795	she	2387	" David , I am afraid , "
91797	91807	91808	91808	I	0	" No , but I ought to warn you , "
91833	91836	91838	91838	I	0	" Catriona , "
91840	91916	91838	91838	I	0	" don t misunderstand me : I am just trying to do my duty by you , girl ! Here am I going alone to this strange city , to be a solitary student there ; and here is this chance arisen that you might dwell with me a bit , and be like my sister ; you can surely understand this much , my dear , that I would just love to have you ? "
91917	91925	91927	91927	she	2412	" Well , and here I am , "
91929	91936	91927	91927	she	2412	" So that s soon settled . "
92151	92160	92162	92162	she	2412	" I must not be disgracing my brother , "
93983	93986	93987	93987	she	2487	" Well , "
93990	94012	93987	93987	she	2487	" if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes , see what I have done with our two chambers . "
94050	94053	94055	94055	I	0	" Catriona , "
94057	94118	94055	94055	I	0	" I am very much displeased with you , and you must never again lay a hand upon my room . One of us two must have the rule while we are here together ; it is most fit it should be I who am both the man and the elder ; and I give you that for my command . "
94132	94139	94141	94141	she	2487	" If you will be cross , "
94143	94195	94141	94141	she	2487	" I must be making pretty manners at you , Davie . I will be very obedient , as I should be when every stitch upon all there is of me belongs to you . But you will not be very cross either , because now I have not anyone else . "
94971	94995	94969	94969	myself	0	" If she were over head in love , and set her cap to catch me , she would scarce behave much otherwise ; "
95593	95605	95607	95607	she	2512	" Are we not to have our walk to - day ? "
95618	95624	95609	95609	I	0	" Where is your brooch ? "
95638	95645	95647	95647	she	2512	" I will have forgotten it , "
95649	95668	95647	95647	she	2512	" I will run upstairs for it quick , and then surely we ll can have our walk ? "
95729	95738	95740	95740	I.	0	" I bought it for you , Catriona , "
95760	95770	95772	95772	I	0	" It is none the better of my handling , "
95778	95795	95797	95797	she	2512	" I will be liking it none the worse , you may be sure of that , "
96176	96186	96187	96187	she	2512	" I will not be doing without my walk , "
96190	96231	96187	96187	she	2512	" You are never a good boy , Davie , in the house ; I will never be caring for you only in the open air . I think we two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the roadside . "
96347	96357	96359	96359	she	2512	" Thank you kindly for these same good hours , "
96618	96628	96629	96629	she	2512	" O , why does not my father come ? "
96674	96682	96684	96684	she	2512	" You do not love your friend , "
96686	96700	96667	96667	She	2512	" I could be so happy too , if you would let me ! "
96704	96719	96667	96667	She	2512	" O , what will I have done that you should hate me so ? "
96720	96724	96726	96726	I	0	" Hate you ! "
96733	96837	96726	96726	I	0	" You blind less , can you not see a little in my wretched heart ? Do you not think when I sit there , reading in that fool - book that I have just burned and be damned to it , I take ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself ? Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone . And what was I to do ? You are here under my honour ; would you punish me for that ? Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant ? "
96904	96911	96912	96912	she	2512	" Did you kiss her truly ? "
96933	96937	96938	96938	I	0	" Miss Grant ? "
96946	96964	96938	96938	I	0	" Yes , I asked her to kiss me good - bye , the which she did . "
96965	96970	96972	96972	she	2512	" Ah , well ! "
96974	96985	96972	96972	she	2512	" you have kissed me too , at all events . "
97011	97017	97019	97019	I.	0	" This will never do , "
97020	97033	97019	97019	I.	0	" This will never , never do . O Catrine , Catrine ! "
97051	97058	97060	97060	I.	0	" Go away to your bed , "
97061	97071	97060	97060	I.	0	" Go away to your bed and leave me . "
97096	97102	97104	97104	she	2512	" Good night , Davie ! "
97106	97116	97117	97117	I	0	" And O , good night , my love ! "
97564	97572	97573	97573	I	0	" O , try to forgive me ! "
97577	97602	97573	97573	I	0	" try , try to forgive me . Let us forget it all , let us try if we ll no can forget it ! "
97649	97660	97662	97662	I.	0	" You can make no hand of this , Davie , "
97663	97689	97662	97662	I.	0	" To bed with you like a wise lad , and try if you can sleep . To - morrow you may see your way . "
97896	97899	97901	97901	he	3029	" Ah , "
97903	97912	97901	97901	he	3029	" I have found you , Mr. Balfour . "
97948	97961	97962	97962	he	3029	" It is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle , "
97965	98014	98015	98015	He	3029	" I am owing you an apology for an unfortunate intrusion upon yours , which I suffered myself to be entrapped into by my confidence in that false - face , Prestongrange ; I think shame to own to you that I was ever trusting to a lawyer . "
98025	98034	98036	98036	he	3029	" But indeed the man is very plausible , "
98038	98065	98015	98015	He	3029	" And now it seems that you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter , for whose direction I was remitted to yourself . "
98066	98072	98074	98074	I	0	" I think , sir , "
98082	98095	98074	98074	I	0	" that it will be necessary we two should have an explanation . "
98096	98102	98103	98103	he	3029	" There is nothing amiss ? "
98106	98112	98103	98103	he	3029	" My agent , Mr. Sprott "
98113	98122	98123	98123	I	0	" For God s sake moderate your voice ! "
98126	98138	98123	98123	I	0	" She must not hear till we have had an explanation . "
98139	98146	98148	98148	he	3029	" She is in this place ? "
98150	98157	98159	98159	I.	0	" That is her chamber door , "
98160	98168	98169	98169	he	3029	" You are here with her alone ? "
98172	98185	98188	98188	I	0	" And who else would I have got to stay with us ? "
98201	98207	98209	98209	he	3029	" This is very unusual , "
98211	98229	98209	98209	he	3029	" This is a very unusual circumstance . You are right , we must hold an explanation . "
98523	98526	98528	98528	he	3029	" Well ? "
98531	98534	98535	98535	I	0	" Well , "
98546	98554	98556	98556	he	3029	" You tell me she is here ? "
98573	98580	98582	98582	I	0	" She is in this house , "
98584	98724	98582	98582	I	0	" and I knew the circumstance would be called unusual . But you are to consider how very unusual the whole business was from the beginning . Here is a young lady landed on the coast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny . She is directed to yon man Sprott in Helvoet . I hear you call him your agent . All I can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at the mere mention of your name , and I must fee him out of my own pocket even to receive the custody of her effects . You speak of unusual circumstances , Mr. Drummond , if that be the name you prefer . Here was a circumstance , if you like , to which it was barbarity to have exposed her . "
98725	98737	98739	98739	James	181	" But this is what I can not understand the least , "
98741	98760	98739	98739	James	181	" My daughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons , whose names I have forgot . "
98761	98767	98769	98769	I	0	" Gebbie was the name , "
98771	98814	98769	98769	I	0	" and there is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie should have gone ashore with her at Helvoet . But he did not , Mr. Drummond ; and I think you might praise God that I was there to offer in his place . "
98815	98829	98831	98831	he	181	" I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long , "
98833	98854	98831	98831	he	181	" As for yourself , I think it might have occurred that you were somewhat young for such a post . "
98855	98874	98876	98876	I.	2563	" But the choice was not between me and somebody else , it was between me and nobody , "
98877	98903	98876	98876	I.	2563	" Nobody offered in my place , and I must say I think you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did . "
98904	98920	98922	98922	he	181	" I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the particular , "
98924	98939	98941	98941	I.	2563	" Indeed , and I think it stares you in the face , then , "
98942	99056	98941	98941	I.	2563	" Your child was deserted , she was clean flung away in the midst of Europe , with scarce two shillings , and not two words of any language spoken there : I must say , a bonny business ! I brought her to this place . I gave her the name and the tenderness due to a sister . All this has not gone without expense , but that I scarce need to hint at . They were services due to the young lady s character which I respect ; and I think it would be a bonny business too , if I was to be singing her praises to her father . "
99057	99064	99065	99065	he	2564	" You are a young man , "
99068	99076	99078	99078	I	0	" So I hear you tell me , "
99087	99095	99096	99096	he	2564	" You are a very young man , "
99099	99111	99096	99096	he	2564	" or you would have understood the significancy of the step . "
99112	99123	99125	99125	I.	0	" I think you speak very much at your ease , "
99126	99251	99125	99125	I.	0	" What else was I to do ? It is a fact I might have hired some decent , poor woman to be a third to us , and I declare I never thought of it until this moment ! But where was I to find her , that am a foreigner myself ? And let me point out to your observation , Mr. Drummond , that it would have cost me money out of my pocket . For here is just what it comes to , that I had to pay through the nose for your neglect ; and there is only the one story to it , just that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your daughter . "
99252	99266	99268	99268	he	2565	" He that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones , "
99270	99294	99268	99268	he	2565	" and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss Drummond before we go on to sit in judgment on her father . "
99295	99306	99308	99308	I.	2566	" But I will be entrapped into no such attitude , "
99309	99395	99308	99308	I.	2566	" The character of Miss Drummond is far above inquiry , as her father ought to know . So is mine , and I am telling you that . There are but the two ways of it open . The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to another , and to say no more . The other if you are so difficult as to be still dissatisfied is to pay me , that which I have expended and be done . "
99408	99413	99415	99415	he	2567	" There , there , "
99417	99459	99415	99415	he	2567	" You go too fast , you go too fast , Mr. Balfour . It is a good thing that I have learned to be more patient . And I believe you forget that I have yet to see my daughter . "
99494	99528	99530	99530	I.	0	" I was thinking it would be more fit if you will excuse the plainness of my dressing in your presence that I should go forth and leave you to encounter her alone ? "
99531	99542	99544	99544	he	2567	" What I would have looked for at your hands ! "
99597	99610	99612	99612	I	0	" If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden , "
99614	99653	99612	99612	I	0	" this room is very much at your disposal , and I can easy find another for myself : in which way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible , there being only one to change . "
99654	99659	99661	99661	he	2567	" Why , sir , "
99668	99715	99661	99661	he	2567	" I think no shame of a poverty I have come by in the service of my king ; I make no secret that my affairs are quite involved ; and for the moment , it would be even impossible for me to undertake a journey . "
99716	99727	99729	99729	I	0	" Until you have occasion to communicate with your friends , "
99731	99761	99729	99729	I	0	" perhaps it might be convenient for you as of course it would be honourable to myself if you were to regard yourself in the light of my guest ? "
99762	99765	99767	99767	he	2567	" Sir , "
99769	99830	99831	99831	he	2567	" when an offer is frankly made , I think I honour myself most to imitate that frankness . Your hand , Mr. David ; you have the character that I respect the most ; you are one of those from whom a gentleman can take a favour and no more words about it . I am an old soldier , "
99844	99879	99831	99831	he	2567	" and you need not fear I shall prove burthensome . I have ate too often at a dyke - side , drank of the ditch , and had no roof but the rain . "
99880	99887	99889	99889	I	0	" I should be telling you , "
99891	99945	99889	99889	I	0	" that our breakfasts are sent customarily in about this time of morning . I propose I should go now to the tavern , and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal the matter of an hour , which will give you an interval to meet your daughter in . "
99953	99959	99961	99961	he	2567	" O , an hour ? "
99963	99994	99995	99995	he	2567	" That is perhaps superfluous . Half an hour , Mr. David , or say twenty minutes ; I shall do very well in that . And by the way , "
100004	100019	99995	99995	he	2567	" what is it you drink in the morning , whether ale or wine ? "
100020	100029	100031	100031	I	0	" To be frank with you , sir , "
100033	100044	100031	100031	I	0	" I drink nothing else but spare , cold water . "
100045	100050	100052	100052	he	2567	" Tut - tut , "
100054	100107	100052	100052	he	2567	" that is fair destruction to the stomach , take an old campaigner s word for it . Our country spirit at home is perhaps the most entirely wholesome ; but as that is not come - at - able , Rhenish or a white wine of Burgundy will be next best . "
100108	100121	100123	100123	I.	0	" I shall make it my business to see you are supplied , "
100124	100130	100132	100132	he	2567	" Why , very good , "
100134	100148	100132	100132	he	2567	" and we shall make a man of you yet , Mr. David . "
100228	100240	100208	100208	I	0	" Miss Drummond , here is your father come at last . "
101199	101210	101212	101212	I.	0	" Can I do anything for you , Mr. Drummond ? "
101226	101232	101234	101234	he	181	" Why , Mr. David , "
101236	101257	101260	101260	he	181	" since you are so obliging as to propose it , you might show me the way to a certain tavern "
101264	101278	101260	101260	he	181	" where I hope to fall in with some old companions in arms . "
101298	101304	101306	101306	he	181	" And as for you , "
101311	101342	101306	101306	he	181	" you had best go to your bed . I shall be late home , and Early to bed and early to rise , gars bonny lasses have bright eyes . "

101877	101890	101856	101856	she	517	" Are we not to have our walk to - day either ? "
101895	101901	101903	101903	she	517	" I am thanking you , "
101905	101923	101903	101903	she	517	" I will not be caring much to walk , now that my father is come home . "
101924	101939	101941	101941	I.	0	" But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone , "
101942	101953	101954	101954	she	517	" And do you think that was very kindly said ? "
101957	101964	101965	101965	I	0	" It was not unkindly meant , "
101968	101990	101965	101965	I	0	" What ails you , Catriona ? What have I done to you that you should turn from me like this ? "
101991	102001	102002	102002	she	517	" I do not turn from you at all , "
102009	102172	102002	102002	she	517	" I will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me ; I will ever be his friend in all that I am able . But now that my father James More is come again , there is a difference to be made , and I think there are some things said and done that would be better to be forgotten . But I will ever be your friend in all that I am able , and if that is not all that . . . . if it is not so much . . . . Not that you will be caring ! But I would not have you think of me too hard . It was true what you said to me , that I was too young to be advised , and I am hoping you will remember I was just a child . I would not like to lose your friendship , at all events . "
102261	102265	102266	102266	I	0	" Miss Drummond , "
102280	102290	102291	102291	I	0	" I wish you could see into my heart , "
102294	102404	102291	102291	I	0	" You would read there that my respect is undiminished . If that were possible , I should say it was increased . This is but the result of the mistake we made ; and had to come ; and the less said of it now the better . Of all of our life here , I promise you it shall never pass my lips ; I would like to promise you too that I would never think of it , but it s a memory that will be always dear to me . And as for a friend , you have one here that would die for you . "
102405	102411	102413	102413	she	2613	" I am thanking you , "
102461	102464	102466	102466	I	0	" Well , "
102468	102517	102466	102466	I	0	" we shall be friends always , that s a certain thing . But this is a kind of farewell , too : it s a kind of a farewell after all ; I shall always ken Miss Drummond , but this is a farewell to my Catriona . "

103311	103317	103297	103297	his	181	" a poor Highland gentleman , "
103319	103328	103330	103330	I	0	" the strength of my country and my friends "
103493	103506	103507	103507	he	181	" This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land , "
103511	103535	103537	103537	he	181	" You may think it strange to see a soldier weep , and indeed it is to make a near friend of you , "
103539	103595	103507	103507	he	181	" But the notes of this singing are in my blood , and the words come out of my heart . And when I mind upon my red mountains and the wild birds calling there , and the brave streams of water running down , I would scarce think shame to weep before my enemies . "
103626	103631	103632	103632	he	181	" It says here , "
103636	103737	103632	103632	he	181	" that the sun is gone down , and the battle is at an end , and the brave chiefs are defeated . And it tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange countries or lying dead on the red mountain ; and they will never more shout the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley . But if you had only some of this language , you would weep also because the words of it are beyond all expression , and it is mere mockery to tell you it in English . "
104213	104227	104228	104228	he	181	" Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident ? "
104235	104238	104231	104231	I	0	" Ay , "
104285	104295	104296	104296	he	181	" All we forfeited folk hang a little together , "
104299	104392	104394	104394	he	181	" and besides I know the gentleman : and though his descent is not the thing , and indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart , he was very much admired in the day of Drummossie . He did there like a soldier ; if some that need not be named had done as well , the upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember . There were two that did their best that day , and it makes a bond between the pair of us , "
104461	104464	104465	104465	I	0	" Catriona , "
104486	104509	104465	104465	I	0	" I am come into my kingdom fairly , I am the laird of Shaws indeed my uncle is dead at last . "
104562	104566	104568	104568	he	181	" My daughter , "
104570	104600	104568	104568	he	181	" is this how my cousin learned you to behave ? Mr. David has lost a new friend , and we should first condole with him on his bereavement . "
104601	104606	104608	104608	I	0	" Troth , sir , "
104619	104639	104608	104608	I	0	" I can make no such great faces . His death is as blithe news as ever I got . "
104640	104649	104651	104651	James	181	" It s a good soldier s philosophy , "
104653	104698	104651	104651	James	181	" Tis the way of flesh , we must all go , all go . And if the gentleman was so far from your favour , why , very well ! But we may at least congratulate you on your accession to your estates . "
104699	104707	104708	104708	I	0	" Nor can I say that either , "
104716	104777	104708	104708	I	0	" It is a good estate ; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already ? I had a good revenue before in my frugality ; and but for the man s death which gratifies me , shame to me that must confess it ! I see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change . "
104778	104783	104785	104785	he	181	" Come , come , "
104787	104860	104785	104785	he	181	" you are more affected than you let on , or you would never make yourself out so lonely . Here are three letters ; that means three that wish you well ; and I could name two more , here in this very chamber . I have known you not so very long , but Catriona , when we are alone , is never done with the singing of your praises . "
104957	104970	104971	104971	he	181	" I do not see you should be one beyond the hour , "
104974	104990	104971	104971	he	181	" and friend David will be good enough to bear me company till you return . "
105079	105092	105094	105094	he	181	" I am rather glad to have a word alone with you , "
105096	105210	105094	105094	he	181	" because in our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and I have long meant to set you right upon . My daughter stands beyond doubt . So do you , and I would make that good with my sword against all gainsayers . But , my dear David , this world is a censorious place as who should know it better than myself , who have lived ever since the days of my late departed father , God sain him ! in a perfect spate of calumnies ? We have to face to that ; you and me have to consider of that ; we have to consider of that . "
105223	105231	105233	105233	I.	2656	" To what effect , Mr. Drummond ? "
105234	105248	105233	105233	I.	2656	" I would be obliged to you if you would approach your point . "
105249	105254	105256	105256	he	2654	" Ay , ay , "
105260	105290	105291	105291	He	2654	" like your character , indeed ! and what I most admire in it . But the point , my worthy fellow , is sometimes in a kittle bit . "
105298	105367	105291	105291	He	2654	" Though between you and me , that are such fast friends , it need not bother us long . The point , I need scarcely tell you , is my daughter . And the first thing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming you . In the unfortunate circumstances , what could you do else ? Deed , and I can not tell . "
105368	105375	105377	105377	I	0	" I thank you for that , "
105385	105393	105394	105394	he	2654	" I have besides studied your character , "
105398	105446	105394	105394	he	2654	" your talents are fair ; you seem to have a moderate competence , which does no harm ; and one thing with another , I am very happy to have to announce to you that I have decided on the latter of the two ways open . "
105447	105455	105457	105457	I.	0	" I am afraid I am dull , "
105458	105464	105465	105465	He	2654	" What ways are these ? "
105477	105482	105484	105484	he	2654	" Why , sir , "
105486	105516	105484	105484	he	2654	" I think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your condition ; either that I should cut your throat or that you should marry my daughter . "
105517	105528	105530	105530	I.	0	" You are pleased to be quite plain at last , "
105531	105543	105545	105545	he	2654	" And I believe I have been plain from the beginning ! "
105548	105597	105545	105545	he	2654	" I am a careful parent , Mr. Balfour ; but I thank God , a patient and deleeborate man . There is many a father , sir , that would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field . My esteem for your character "
105598	105602	105603	105603	I	0	" Mr. Drummond , "
105606	105649	105603	105603	I	0	" if you have any esteem for me at all , I will beg of you to moderate your voice . It is quite needless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best attention . "
105650	105656	105658	105658	he	2657	" Why , very true , "
105665	105676	105658	105658	he	2657	" And you must excuse the agitations of a parent . "
105677	105683	105684	105684	I	0	" I understand you then , "
105686	105728	105684	105684	I	0	" for I will take no note of your other alternative , which perhaps it was a pity you let fall I understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for your daughter s hand ? "
105729	105740	105742	105742	he	2657	" It is not possible to express my meaning better , "
105744	105754	105742	105742	he	2657	" and I see we shall do well together . "
105755	105763	105765	105765	I.	0	" That remains to be yet seen , "
105766	105809	105765	105765	I.	0	" But so much I need make no secret of , that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection , and I could not fancy , even in a dream , a better fortune than to get her . "
105810	105825	105826	105826	he	2657	" I was sure of it , I felt certain of you , David , "
105842	105851	105853	105853	I.	0	" You go too fast , Mr. Drummond , "
105854	105916	105853	105853	I.	0	" There are conditions to be made ; and there is a difficulty in the path , which I see not entirely how we shall come over . I have told you that , upon my side , there is no objection to the marriage , but I have good reason to believe there will be much on the young lady s. "
105917	105925	105927	105927	he	2657	" This is all beside the mark , "
105929	105937	105927	105927	he	2657	" I will engage for her acceptance . "
105938	105947	105949	105949	I	0	" I think you forget , Mr. Drummond , "
105951	106028	105949	105949	I	0	" that , even in dealing with myself , you have been betrayed into two - three unpalatable expressions . I will have none such employed to the young lady . I am here to speak and think for the two of us ; and I give you to understand that I would no more let a wife be forced upon myself , than what I would let a husband be forced on the young lady . "
106046	106057	106058	106058	I	0	" So that is to be the way of it , "
106061	106098	106058	106058	I	0	" I will marry Miss Drummond , and that blithely , if she is entirely willing . But if there be the least unwillingness , as I have reason to fear marry her will I never . "
106099	106103	106105	106105	he	2658	" Well well , "
106107	106131	106105	106105	he	2658	" this is a small affair . As soon as she returns I will sound her a bit , and hope to reassure you "
106138	106165	106167	106167	I.	0	" Not a finger of you , Mr. Drummond , or I cry off , and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else , "
106168	106202	106167	106167	I.	0	" It is I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge . I shall satisfy myself exactly ; and none else shall anyways meddle you the least of all . "
106203	106210	106211	106211	he	2659	" Upon my word , sir ! "
106214	106224	106211	106211	he	2659	" and who are you to be the judge ? "
106225	106232	106234	106234	I.	0	" The bridegroom , I believe , "
106235	106241	106242	106242	he	2659	" This is to quibble , "
106245	106272	106242	106242	he	2659	" You turn your back upon the fact . The girl , my daughter , has no choice left to exercise . Her character is gone . "
106273	106280	106282	106282	I	0	" And I ask your pardon , "
106284	106302	106282	106282	I	0	" but while this matter lies between her and you and me , that is not so . "
106303	106309	106310	106310	he	2659	" What security have I ! "
106313	106327	106310	106310	he	2659	" Am I to let my daughter s reputation depend upon a chance ? "
106328	106339	106341	106341	I	0	" You should have thought of all this long ago , "
106343	106476	106341	106341	I	0	" before you were so misguided as to lose her ; and not afterwards when it is quite too late . I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect , and I will be browbeat by no man living . My mind is quite made up , and come what may , I will not depart from it a hair s breadth . You and me are to sit here in company till her return : upon which , without either word or look from you , she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk . If she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step , I will then make it ; and if she can not , I will not . "
106488	106495	106496	106496	he	2660	" I can spy your manouvre , "
106499	106508	106496	106496	he	2660	" you would work upon her to refuse ! "
106509	106517	106519	106519	I.	2662	" Maybe ay , and maybe no , "
106520	106532	106519	106519	I.	2662	" That is the way it is to be , whatever . "
106533	106539	106541	106541	he	2660	" And if I refuse ? "
106543	106560	106562	106562	I.	2662	" Then , Mr. Drummond , it will have to come to the throat - cutting , "
106746	106762	106764	106764	I	0	" If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself , "
106766	106785	106764	106764	I	0	" I must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about her unwillingness . "
106794	106807	106808	106808	I	0	" But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers , "
106811	106825	106808	106808	I	0	" and I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence . "
106876	106886	106888	106888	I.	0	" Your father wishes us to take our walk , "
107164	107167	107169	107169	I	0	" Catriona , "
107171	107221	107169	107169	I	0	" I am in a very painful situation ; or rather , so we are both ; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you would promise to let me speak through first of all , and not to interrupt me till I have done . "
107228	107231	107233	107233	I	0	" Well , "
107235	107501	107233	107233	I	0	" this that I have got to say is very difficult , and I know very well I have no right to be saying it . After what passed between the two of us last Friday , I have no manner of right . We have got so ravelled up and all by my fault that I know very well the least I could do is just to hold my tongue , which was what I intended fully , and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you again . But , my dear , it has become merely necessary , and no way by it . You see , this estate of mine has fallen in , which makes of me rather a better match ; and the the business would not have quite the same ridiculous - like appearance that it would before . Besides which , it s supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up as I was saying that it would be better to let them be the way they are . In my view , this part of the thing is vastly exagerate , and if I were you I would not wear two thoughts on it . Only it s right I should mention the same , because there s no doubt it has some influence on James More . Then I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before . I think we did pretty well together . If you would look back , my dear "
107502	107511	107512	107512	she	2674	" I will look neither back nor forward , "
107515	107529	107512	107512	she	2674	" Tell me the one thing : this is my father s doing ? "
107530	107536	107538	107538	I.	2675	" He approves of it , "
107539	107552	107569	107569	she	2674	" He approved I that I should ask your hand in marriage , "
107580	107586	107587	107587	she	2674	" He told you to ! "
107590	107615	107587	107587	she	2674	" It is no sense denying it , you said yourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts . He told you to . "
107616	107631	107632	107632	I	0	" He spoke of it the first , if that is what you mean , "
107670	107674	107675	107675	I	0	" Without which , "
107679	107714	107675	107675	I	0	" after what you said last Friday , I would never have been so troublesome as make the offer . But when he as good as asked me , what was I to do ? "
107723	107733	107734	107734	she	2674	" Well , it is refused at all events , "
107737	107747	107734	107734	she	2674	" and there will be an end of that . "
107756	107765	107767	107767	I	0	" I suppose I could expect no better , "
107769	107866	107767	107767	I	0	" but I think you might try to be a little kind to me for the last end of it . I see not why you should be harsh . I have loved you very well , Catriona no harm that I should call you so for the last time . I have done the best that I could manage , I am trying the same still , and only vexed that I can do no better . It is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to be hard to me . "
107867	107875	107876	107876	she	2676	" I am not thinking of you , "
107879	107890	107876	107876	she	2676	" I am thinking of that man , my father . "
107891	107900	107902	107902	I.	2677	" Well , and that way , too ! "
107903	107954	107902	107902	I.	2677	" I can be of use to you that way , too ; I will have to be . It is very needful , my dear , that we should consult about your father ; for the way this talk has gone , an angry man will be James More . "
107959	107967	107968	107968	she	2676	" It is because I am disgraced ? "
107971	107979	107980	107980	I	0	" That is what he is thinking , "
107983	107996	107980	107980	I	0	" but I have told you already to make nought of it . "
107997	108006	108007	108007	she	2676	" It will be all one to me , "
108010	108017	108007	108007	she	2676	" I prefer to be disgraced ! "
108051	108080	108047	108047	she	2676	" And what is the meaning of all this ? Why is all this shame loundered on my head ? How could you dare it , David Balfour ? "
108081	108085	108087	108087	I	0	" My dear , "
108089	108097	108087	108087	I	0	" what else was I to do ? "
108098	108105	108106	108106	she	2676	" I am not your dear , "
108109	108121	108106	108106	she	2676	" and I defy you to be calling me these words . "
108122	108131	108133	108133	I.	0	" I am not thinking of my words , "
108134	108222	108133	108133	I.	0	" My heart bleeds for you , Miss Drummond . Whatever I may say , be sure you have my pity in your difficult position . But there is just the one thing that I wish you would bear in view , if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly ; for there is going to be a collieshangie when we two get home . Take my word for it , it will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace . "
108223	108226	108228	108228	she	2676	" Ay , "
108242	108249	108251	108251	she	2676	" Was he for fighting you ? "
108253	108260	108133	108133	I.	0	" Well , he was that , "
108271	108280	108281	108281	she	2676	" At all events , it is complete ! "
108290	108300	108302	108302	she	2676	" My father and I are a fine pair , "
108304	108350	108302	108302	she	2676	" but I am thanking the good God there will be somebody worse than what we are . I am thanking the good God that he has let me see you so . There will never be the girl made that will not scorn you . "
108367	108379	108381	108381	I.	0	" You have no right to speak to me like that , "
108382	108412	108381	108381	I.	0	" What have I done but to be good to you , or try to be ? And here is my repayment ! O , it is too much . "
108423	108426	108428	108428	she	2676	" Coward ! "
108430	108442	108443	108443	I	0	" The word in your throat and in your father s ! "
108446	108481	108483	108483	I	0	" I have dared him this day already in your interest . I will dare him again , the nasty pole - cat ; little I care which of us should fall ! Come , "
108485	108523	108483	108483	I	0	" back to the house with us ; let us be done with it , let me be done with the whole Hieland crew of you ! You will see what you think when I am dead . "
108541	108547	108548	108548	I	0	" O , smile away ! "
108551	108577	108578	108578	I	0	" I have seen your bonny father smile on the wrong side this day . Not that I mean he was afraid , of course , "
108582	108592	108578	108578	I	0	" but he preferred the other way of it . "
108593	108598	108599	108599	she	2678	" What is this ? "
108602	108611	108613	108613	I.	0	" When I offered to draw with him , "
108614	108623	108624	108624	she	2678	" You offered to draw upon James More ! "
108627	108633	108635	108635	I	0	" And I did so , "
108637	108651	108635	108635	I	0	" and found him backward enough , or how would we be here ? "
108652	108660	108662	108662	she	2678	" There is a meaning upon this , "
108664	108672	108662	108662	she	2678	" What is it you are meaning ? "
108673	108682	108683	108683	I	0	" He was to make you take me , "
108686	108907	108683	108683	I	0	" and I would not have it . I said you should be free , and I must speak with you alone ; little I supposed it would be such a speaking ! And what if I refuse ? said he . Then it must come to the throat - cutting , says I , for I will no more have a husband forced on that young lady , than what I would have a wife forced upon myself . These were my words , they were a friend s words ; bonnily have I paid for them ! Now you have refused me of your own clear free will , and there lives no father in the Highlands , or out of them , that can force on this marriage . I will see that your wishes are respected ; I will make the same my business , as I have all through . But I think you might have that decency as to affect some gratitude . Deed , and I thought you knew me better ! I have not behaved quite well to you , but that was weakness . And to think me a coward , and such a coward as that O , my lass , there was a stab for the last of it ! "
108908	108916	108917	108917	she	2679	" Davie , how would I guess ? "
108920	108933	108934	108934	she	2679	" O , this is a dreadful business ! Me and mine , "
108945	108979	108934	108934	she	2679	" me and mine are not fit to speak to you . O , I could be kneeling down to you in the street , I could be kissing your hands for forgiveness ! "
108980	108993	108995	108995	I.	2680	" I will keep the kisses I have got from you already , "
108996	109018	108995	108995	I.	2680	" I will keep the ones I wanted and that were something worth ; I will not be kissed in penitence . "
109019	109030	109032	109032	she	2679	" What can you be thinking of this miserable girl ? "
109034	109046	109048	109048	I	0	" What I am trying to tell you all this while ! "
109050	109094	109048	109048	I	0	" that you had best leave me alone , whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried , and turn your attention to James More , your father , with whom you are like to have a queer pirn to wind . "
109095	109113	109114	109114	she	2679	" O , that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man ! "
109128	109137	109139	109139	she	2679	" But trouble yourself no more for that , "
109141	109174	109139	109139	she	2679	" He does not know what kind of nature is in my heart . He will pay me dear for this day of it ; dear , dear , will he pay . "
109194	109201	109202	109202	she	2679	" I will be going alone , "
109205	109215	109202	109202	she	2679	" It is alone I must be seeing him . "
109314	109317	109318	109318	I	0	" Well , "
109321	109404	109318	109318	I	0	" I have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy long enough . Time it was done . Here is a good lesson to have nothing to do with that accursed sex , that was the ruin of the man in the beginning and will be so to the end . God knows I was happy enough before ever I saw her ; God knows I can be happy enough again when I have seen the last of her . "
109706	109717	109719	109719	she	189	" I will tell you what James More is meaning , "
109721	109810	109719	109719	she	189	" He means we have come to you , beggar - folk , and have not behaved to you very well , and we are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill - behaviour . Now we are wanting to go away and be forgotten ; and my father will have guided his gear so ill , that we can not even do that unless you will give us some more alms . For that is what we are , at an events , beggar - folk and sorners . "
109811	109819	109821	109821	I	0	" By your leave , Miss Drummond , "
109823	109833	109821	109821	I	0	" I must speak to your father by myself . "
109852	109861	109863	109864	James More	181	" You must excuse her , Mr. Balfour , "
109866	109872	109863	109864	James More	181	" She has no delicacy . "
109873	109884	109886	109886	I	0	" I am not here to discuss that with you , "
109888	109963	109886	109886	I	0	" but to be quit of you . And to that end I must talk of your position . Now , Mr. Drummond , I have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for . I know you had money of your own when you were borrowing mine . I know you have had more since you were here in Leyden , though you concealed it even from your daughter . "
109964	109977	109978	109978	he	2699	" I bid you beware . I will stand no more baiting , "
109982	110011	110013	110013	he	2699	" I am sick of her and you . What kind of a damned trade is this to be a parent ! I have had expressions used to me "
110017	110031	110032	110032	he	2699	" Sir , this is the heart of a soldier and a parent , "
110044	110055	110032	110032	he	2699	" outraged in both characters and I bid you beware . "
110056	110065	110067	110067	I	0	" If you would have let me finish , "
110069	110080	110067	110067	I	0	" you would have found I spoke for your advantage . "
110081	110086	110087	110087	he	2699	" My dear friend , "
110090	110104	110087	110087	he	2699	" I know I might have relied upon the generosity of your character . "
110105	110114	110116	110116	I.	0	" Man ! will you let me speak ? "
110117	110251	110116	110116	I.	0	" The fact is that I can not win to find out if you are rich or poor . But it is my idea that your means , as they are mysterious in their source , so they are something insufficient in amount ; and I do not choose your daughter to be lacking . If I durst speak to herself , you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it to you ; because I know you like the back of my hand , and all your blustering talk is that much wind to me . However , I believe in your way you do still care something for your daughter after all ; and I must just be doing with that ground of confidence , such as it is . "
110306	110315	110316	110316	he	2700	" My dear fellow , my dear son , "
110320	110341	110316	110316	he	2700	" this is more like yourself than any of it yet ! I will serve you with a soldier s faithfulness "
110342	110351	110353	110353	I.	0	" Let me hear no more of it ! "
110354	110403	110353	110353	I.	0	" You have got me to that pitch that the bare name of soldier rises on my stomach . Our traffic is settled ; I am now going forth and will return in one half - hour , when I expect to find my chambers purged of you . "
111243	111437	111240	111241	James More	181	" My dear Sir , Your esteemed favour came to hand duly , and I have to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement . It shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter , who is well , and desires to be remembered to her dear friend . I find her in rather a melancholy disposition , but trust in the mercy of God to see her re - established . Our manner of life is very much alone , but we solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains , and by walking up the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland . It was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of Gladsmuir . I have found employment here in the haras of a French nobleman , where my experience is valued . But , my dear Sir , the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention them , which makes your remittances the more necessary to my daughter s comfort , though I daresay the sight of old friends would be still better .
111438	111443	111444	111448	Your affectionate , obedient servant	2713	" My dear Sir , "
111450	111455	111444	111448	Your affectionate , obedient servant	2713	" James Macgregor Drummond . "
111466	111482	111464	111464	Catriona	189	" Do not be believing him , it is all lies together , C. M. D. "
111653	111663	111664	111664	he	185	" I cannae make heed nor tail of it , "
111668	111742	111664	111664	he	185	" but it sticks in my mind ye ve made a gowk of yourself . There s few people that has had more experience than Alan Breck : and I can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours . The way that you tell it , the thing s fair impossible . Ye must have made a terrible hash of the business , David . "
111743	111755	111757	111757	I.	0	" There are whiles that I am of the same mind , "
111758	111776	111778	111778	Alan	185	" The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her too ! "
111780	111787	111789	111789	I	0	" The biggest kind , Alan , "
111791	111805	111789	111789	I	0	" and I think I ll take it to my grave with me . "
111806	111815	111816	111816	he	185	" Well , ye beat me , whatever ! "
111830	111835	111836	111836	he	185	" And here again ! "
111839	111918	111836	111836	he	185	" Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona , and sense forby ! As for James More , the man s as boss as a drum ; he s just a wame and a wheen words ; though I ll can never deny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir , and it s true what he says here about the five wounds . But the loss of him is that the man s boss . "
111919	111925	111927	111927	I	0	" Ye see , Alan , "
111929	111946	111927	111927	I	0	" it goes against the grain with me to leave the maid in such poor hands . "
111947	111954	111955	111955	he	185	" Ye couldnae weel find poorer , "
111958	112080	111955	111955	he	185	" But what are ye to do with it ? It s this way about a man and a woman , ye see , Davie : The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them . Either they like the man , and then a goes fine ; or else they just detest him , and ye may spare your breath ye can do naething . There s just the two sets of them them that would sell their coats for ye , and them that never look the road ye re on . That s a that there is to women ; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither . "
112081	112094	112096	112096	I.	2721	" Well , and I m afraid that s true for me , "
112097	112105	112107	112107	Alan	185	" And yet there s naething easier ! "
112109	112140	112107	112107	Alan	185	" I could easy learn ye the science of the thing ; but ye seem to me to be born blind , and there s where the deefficulty comes in . "
112141	112149	112150	112150	I	0	" And can you no help me ? "
112153	112163	112150	112150	I	0	" you that are so clever at the trade ? "
112164	112174	112176	112176	he	185	" Ye see , David , I wasnae here , "
112178	112232	112176	112176	he	185	" I m like a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and ĂŠclaireurs ; and what would he ken ? But it sticks in my mind that ye ll have made some kind of bauchle ; and if I was you I would have a try at her again . "
112233	112241	112243	112243	I.	0	" Would ye so , man Alan ? "
112244	112251	112253	112253	he	185	" I would e en t , "
112322	112337	112338	112338	he	181	" You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart , "
112341	112533	112338	112338	he	181	" Why not accompany him so far in his return to France ? I have something very particular for Mr. Stewart s ear ; and , at any rate , I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow - soldier and one so mettle as himself . As for you , my dear sir , my daughter and I would be proud to receive our benefactor , whom we regard as a brother and a son . The French nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character , and I have been necessitate to leave the haras . You will find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the auberge of a man Bazin on the dunes ; but the situation is caller , and I make no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days , when Mr. Stewart and I could recall our services , and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting your age . I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would come here ; my business with him opens a very wide door . "
112534	112543	112545	112545	Alan	185	" What does the man want with me ? "
112552	112574	112545	112545	Alan	185	" What he wants with you is clear enough it s siller . But what can he want with Alan Breck ? "
112575	112585	112587	112587	I.	2725	" O , it ll be just an excuse , "
112588	112625	112587	112587	I.	2725	" He is still after this marriage , which I wish from my heart that we could bring about . And he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you . "
112626	112635	112637	112637	Alan	185	" Well , I wish that I kent , "
112639	112729	112637	112637	Alan	185	" Him and me were never onyways pack ; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers . Something for my ear , quo he ! I ll maybe have something for his hinder - end , before we re through with it . Dod , I m thinking it would be a kind of divertisement to gang and see what he ll be after ! Forby that I could see your lassie then . What say ye , Davie ? Will ye ride with Alan ? "
112932	112939	112941	112942	the guide	2735	" Voila l auberge a Bazin , "

113179	113200	113201	113201	she	3012	" My father , James More , will be here soon . He will be very pleased to see you , "
113260	113271	113272	113272	she	3012	" And you will be his friend , Alan Breck ? "
113275	113302	113272	113272	she	3012	" Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you ; and I love you already for all your bravery and goodness . "
113303	113308	113310	113310	Alan	185	" Well , well , "
113321	113347	113310	113310	Alan	185	" and so this is the young lady at the last of it ! David , ye re an awful poor hand of a description . "
113374	113384	113385	113385	she	3012	" What ? will he have been describing me ? "
113388	113401	113403	113403	he	185	" Little else of it since I ever came out of France ! "
113405	113548	113403	113403	he	185	" forby a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by Silvermills . But cheer up , my dear ! ye re bonnier than what he said . And now there s one thing sure ; you and me are to be a pair of friends . I m a kind of a henchman to Davie here ; I m like a tyke at his heels ; and whatever he cares for , I ve got to care for too and by the holy airn ! they ve got to care for me ! So now you can see what way you stand with Alan Breck , and ye ll find ye ll hardly lose on the transaction . He s no very bonnie , my dear , but he s leal to them he loves . "
113549	113561	113563	113563	she	2745	" I thank you from my heart for your good words , "
113565	113587	113563	113563	she	2745	" I have that honour for a brave , honest man that I can not find any to be answering with . "
114094	114099	114101	114101	he	185	" Ye muckle ass ! "
114103	114111	114112	114112	I	0	" What do ye mean by that ? "
114115	114130	114132	114132	he	185	" Mean ? What do I mean ! It s extraordinar , David man , "
114134	114143	114132	114132	he	185	" that you should be so mortal stupit . "
114152	114161	114163	114163	he	185	" Well , it s this of it , "
114165	114208	114163	114163	he	185	" I told ye there were the two kinds of women them that would sell their shifts for ye , and the others . Just you try for yoursel , my bonny man ! But what s that neepkin at your craig ? "
114213	114221	114223	114223	he	185	" I thocht it was something thereabout , "
114817	114829	114831	114831	Alan	185	" I am caring less and less about this man James , "
114833	114954	114831	114831	Alan	185	" There s something no right with the man James , and I shouldnae wonder but what Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day . I would like fine to see yon French nobleman , Davie ; and I daresay you could find an employ to yoursel , and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o your affair . Just tell it to her plainly tell her ye re a muckle ass at the off - set ; and then , if I were you , and ye could do it naitural , I would just mint to her I was in some kind of a danger ; a weemenfolk likes that . "
114955	114968	114970	114970	I	0	" I cannae lee , Alan , I cannae do it naitural , "
114975	114981	114983	114983	he	2792	" The more fool you ! "
114985	115060	114983	114983	he	2792	" Then ye ll can tell her that I recommended it ; that ll set her to the laughing ; and I wouldnae wonder but what that was the next best . But see to the pair of them ! If I didnae feel just sure of the lassie , and that she was awful pleased and chief with Alan , I would think there was some kind of hocus - pocus about you . "
115061	115074	115075	115075	I	0	" And is she so pleased with ye , then , Alan ? "
115078	115086	115088	115088	he	2792	" She thinks a heap of me , "
115090	115156	115088	115088	he	2792	" And I m no like you : I m one that can tell . That she does she thinks a heap of Alan . And troth ! I m thinking a good deal of him mysel ; and with your permission , Shaws , I ll be getting a wee yont amang the bents , so that I can see what way James goes . "
115823	115826	115820	115820	I	0	" good morning "
115842	115851	115853	115853	I.	0	" Will you forgive my having followed you ? "
115854	115863	115864	115864	she	189	" I know you are always meaning kindly , "
115875	115892	115864	115864	she	189	" but why will you be sending money to that man ! It must not be . "
115893	115901	115903	115903	I	0	" I never sent it for him , "
115905	115915	115903	115903	I	0	" but for you , as you know well . "
115916	115932	115933	115933	she	189	" And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us , "
115936	115944	115933	115933	she	189	" David , it is not right . "
115945	115955	115957	115957	I	0	" It is not , it is all wrong , "
115959	116016	115957	115957	I	0	" and I pray God he will help this dull fellow if it be at all possible to make it better . Catriona , this is no kind of life for you to lead ; and I ask your pardon for the word , but yon man is no fit father to take care of you . "
116017	116027	116029	116029	her	189	" Do not be speaking of him , even ! "
116032	116059	116061	116061	I.	0	" And I need speak of him no more ; it is not of him that I am thinking , O , be sure of that ! "
116062	116195	116061	116061	I.	0	" I think of the one thing . I have been alone now this long time in Leyden ; and when I was by way of at my studies , still I was thinking of that . Next Alan came , and I went among soldier - men to their big dinners ; and still I had the same thought . And it was the same before , when I had her there beside me . Catriona , do you see this napkin at my throat ! You cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you . They re your colours now ; I wear them in my heart . My dear , I can not be wanting you . O , try to put up with me ! "
116208	116216	116217	116217	I	0	" Try to put up with me , "
116221	116230	116217	116217	I	0	" try and bear me with a little . "
116252	116255	116256	116256	I	0	" Catriona , "
116264	116276	116256	116256	I	0	" is it a mistake again ? Am I quite lost ? "
116286	116296	116298	116298	she	2826	" Do you want me , Davie , truly ? "
116309	116314	116316	116316	I.	0	" I do that , "
116317	116328	116316	116316	I.	0	" O , sure you know it I do that . "
116329	116341	116343	116343	she	2826	" I have nothing left to give or to keep back , "
116345	116365	116366	116366	she	2826	" I was all yours from the first day , if you would have had a gift of me ! "
116485	116488	116489	116489	she	2826	" Davie , "
116493	116523	116489	116489	she	2826	" O , Davie , is this what you think of me ! Is it so that you were caring for poor me ! O , Davie , Davie ! "
116667	116672	116673	116673	I	0	" My little friend , "
116706	116733	116743	116743	she	2826	" My little friend , now you are mine altogether ; mine for good , my little friend and that man s no longer at all . "
116750	116759	116760	116760	she	2826	" Davie , take me away from him ! "
116763	116811	116760	116760	she	2826	" There s something wrong ; he s not true . There will be something wrong ; I have a dreadful terror here at my heart . What will he be wanting at all events with that King s ship ? What will this word be saying ? "
116819	116842	116813	116813	she	2826	" My mind misgives me , it will be some ill to Alan . Open it , Davie open it and see . "
116857	116860	116862	116862	I	0	" No , "
116864	116879	116862	116862	I	0	" it goes against me , I can not open a man s letter . "
116880	116887	116888	116888	she	2826	" Not to save your friend ? "
116891	116896	116898	116898	I.	0	" I cannae tell , "
116899	116910	116898	116898	I.	0	" I think not . If I was only sure ! "
116911	116921	116923	116923	she	2826	" And you have but to break the seal ! "
116925	116930	116932	116932	I	0	" I know it , "
116934	116942	116932	116932	I	0	" but the thing goes against me . "
116943	116948	116950	116950	she	2826	" Give it here , "
116952	116960	116950	116950	she	2826	" and I will open it myself . "
116961	116966	116968	116968	I.	0	" Nor you neither , "
116969	117068	116968	116968	I.	0	" You least of all . It concerns your father , and his honour , dear , which we are both misdoubting . No question but the place is dangerous - like , and the English ship being here , and your father having word from it , and yon officer that stayed ashore . He would not be alone either ; there must be more along with him ; I daresay we are spied upon this minute . Ay , no doubt , the letter should be opened ; but somehow , not by you nor me . "
117177	117180	117182	117182	I	0	" There , "
117184	117206	117182	117182	I	0	" there is the man that has the best right to open it : or not , as he thinks fit . "
117227	117243	117244	117244	she	2842	" If it is so if it be more disgrace will you can bear it ? "
117255	117273	117275	117275	I.	0	" I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the once , "
117276	117312	117275	117275	I.	0	" What do you think I answered ? That if I liked you as I thought I did and O , but I like you better ! I would marry you at his gallows foot . "
117351	117360	117362	117362	he	185	" What was I telling ye , David ? "
117364	117375	117377	117377	I	0	" There is a time for all things , Alan , "
117379	117402	117377	117377	I	0	" and this time is serious . How have you sped ? You can speak out plain before this friend of ours . "
117403	117413	117415	117415	he	185	" I have been upon a fool s errand , "
117417	117429	117431	117431	I	0	" I doubt we have done better than you , then , "
117433	117457	117431	117431	I	0	" and , at least , here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of . Do you see that ? "
117467	117476	117458	117458	I	0	" That is the Seahorse , Captain Palliser . "
117477	117485	117487	117487	Alan	185	" I should ken her , too , "
117489	117514	117487	117487	Alan	185	" I had fyke enough with her when she was stationed in the Forth . But what ails the man to come so close ? "
117515	117526	117528	117528	I.	0	" I will tell you why he came there first , "
117529	117587	117528	117528	I.	0	" It was to bring this letter to James More . Why he stops here now that it s delivered , what it s likely to be about , why there s an officer hiding in the bents , and whether or not it s probable that he s alone I would rather you considered for yourself . "
117588	117595	117597	117597	he	185	" A letter to James More ? "
117599	117603	117605	117605	I.	0	" The same , "
117606	117618	117620	117620	Alan	185	" Well , and I can tell ye more than that , "
117622	117659	117620	117620	Alan	185	" For the last night , when you were fast asleep , I heard the man colloguing with some one in the French , and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut . "
117660	117663	117665	117665	I	0	" Alan ! "
117667	117681	117665	117665	I	0	" you slept all night , and I am here to prove it . "
117682	117698	117700	117700	he	185	" Ay , but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking ! "
117702	117715	117700	117700	he	185	" But the business looks bad . Let s see the letter . "
117721	117724	117726	117726	he	185	" Catriona , "
117728	117762	117726	117726	he	185	" you have to excuse me , my dear ; but there s nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it , and I ll have to break this seal . "
117763	117769	117771	117771	Catriona	189	" It is my wish , "
117789	117794	117796	117796	he	185	" The stinking brock ! "
117806	117824	117826	117826	he	185	" Here , let s get our things together . This place is fair death to me . "
117842	117848	117849	117849	she	189	" He has sold you ? "
117852	117859	117861	117861	Alan	185	" Sold me , my dear , "
117863	117886	117887	117887	he	185	" But thanks to you and Davie , I ll can jink him yet . Just let me win upon my horse , "
117890	117897	117899	117899	I.	2846	" Catriona must come with us , "
117900	117919	117922	117922	she	189	" She can have no more traffic with that man . She and I are to be married . "
117930	117937	117939	117939	Alan	185	" Are ye there with it ? "
117944	117976	117939	117939	Alan	185	" The best day s work that ever either of you did yet ! And I m bound to say , my dawtie , ye make a real , bonny couple . "
118024	118029	117996	118010	a man in seaman s trousers , who seemed to be spying from behind it	2849	" See , Alan ! "
118030	118033	118036	118036	he	2849	" Wheesht ! "
118038	118044	118036	118036	he	2849	" this is my affairs . "
118088	118094	118096	118096	Alan	185	" I think , sir , "
118098	118105	118096	118096	Alan	185	" that you speak the English ? "
118106	118111	118113	118113	he	3029	" Non , monsieur , "
118121	118126	118128	118128	Alan	185	" Non , monsieur , "
118133	118161	118128	118128	Alan	185	" Is that how they learn you French on the Seahorse ? Ye muckle , gutsey hash , here s a Scots boot to your English hurdies ! "
118209	118223	118225	118225	Alan	185	" But it s high time I was clear of these empty bents ! "
118271	118274	118276	118276	I	0	" Here ! "
118280	118299	118276	118276	I	0	" quick ! upstairs with you and make your packets ; this is no fit scene for you . "
118445	118457	118459	118459	he	185	" A braw good day to ye again , Mr. Drummond , "
118461	118472	118459	118459	he	185	" What ll yon business of yours be just about ? "
118473	118488	118490	118490	James	181	" Why , the thing being private , and rather of a long story , "
118492	118505	118490	118490	James	181	" I think it will keep very well till we have eaten . "
118506	118515	118517	118517	Alan	185	" I m none so sure of that , "
118519	118554	118517	118517	Alan	185	" It sticks in my mind it s either now or never ; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here have gotten a line , and we re thinking of the road . "
118571	118586	118588	118588	he	181	" I have but the one word to say to cure you of that , "
118590	118600	118588	118588	he	181	" and that is the name of my business . "
118601	118606	118608	118608	Alan	185	" Say it then , "
118610	118618	118608	118608	Alan	185	" Hout ! wha minds for Davie ? "
118619	118632	118634	118634	James	181	" It is a matter that would make us both rich men , "
118636	118643	118645	118645	Alan	185	" Do you tell me that ? "
118647	118653	118655	118655	James	181	" I do , sir , "
118657	118669	118655	118655	James	181	" The plain fact is that it is Cluny s Treasure . "
118670	118673	118675	118675	Alan	185	" No ! "
118677	118685	118675	118675	Alan	185	" Have ye got word of it ? "
118686	118701	118703	118703	James	181	" I ken the place , Mr. Stewart , and can take you there , "
118705	118710	118712	118712	Alan	185	" This crowns all ! "
118714	118742	118712	118712	Alan	185	" Well , and I m glad I came to Dunkirk . And so this was your business , was it ? Halvers , I m thinking ? "
118743	118751	118753	118753	James	181	" That is the business , sir , "
118755	118760	118762	118762	Alan	185	" Well , well , "
118774	118786	118787	118787	he	185	" it has naething to do with the Seahorse , then ? "
118790	118794	118796	118796	James	181	" With what ? "
118798	118814	118816	118816	Alan	185	" Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill ? "
118818	118859	118816	118816	Alan	185	" Hut , man ! have done with your lees ! I have Palliser s letter here in my pouch . You re by with it , James More . You can never show your face again with dacent folk . "
118884	118894	118895	118895	he	181	" Do you talk to me , you bastard ? "
118899	118905	118907	118907	Alan	185	" Ye glee d swine ! "
118996	119012	119014	119014	Alan	185	" Keep back , Davie ! Are ye daft ! Damn ye , keep back ! "
119016	119026	119014	119014	Alan	185	" Your blood be on your ain heid then ! "
119153	119170	119171	119171	she	517	" Will you be killing him before my eyes , and me his daughter after all ! "
119174	119184	119186	119186	Alan	185	" My dear , I have done with him , "
119230	119233	119235	119235	her	517	" Begone ! "
119238	119269	119210	119210	she	517	" take your shame out of my sight ; leave me with clean folk . I am a daughter of Alpin ! Shame of the sons of Alpin , begone ! "
119338	119341	119343	119343	he	185	" Why , "
119358	119370	119343	119343	he	185	" if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau "
119371	119384	119386	119386	Alan	185	" There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me , "
119388	119391	119393	119393	James	181	" Sir ! "

But take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harm s way or ower late . Little as you suppose it , there are leemits to my temper . "
119463	119475	119477	119477	James	181	" Be damned , sir , but my money s there ! "
119479	119488	119490	119490	Alan	185	" I m vexed about that , too , "
119497	119508	119493	119493	his	185	" but now , ye see , it s mines . "
119515	119528	119490	119490	Alan	185	" Be you advised , James More , you leave this house . "
119597	119600	119601	119601	I	0	" Catriona , "

119621	119651	119652	119652	she	2877	" I know it , Davie , I am loving you for the pain of it ; it was done defending that bad man , my father . See ! "
119662	119684	119652	119652	she	2877	" see , you have made a man of me now . I will carry a wound like an old soldier . "
119714	119732	119734	119734	Alan	185	" And am I to be out of the kissing , me that never lost a chance ? "
119747	119751	119752	119752	he	185	" My dear , "
119755	119822	119752	119752	he	185	" you re a true daughter of Alpin . By all accounts , he was a very fine man , and he may weel be proud of you . If ever I was to get married , it s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to my sons . And I bear s a king s name and speak the truth . "
119869	119879	119881	119881	he	185	" And now by your leave , my dawties , "
119883	119922	119881	119881	he	185	" this is a very bonny ; but Alan Breck ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he s caring for ; and Dod ! I think this is a grand place to be leaving . "
120032	120035	120036	120036	I	0	" Here , "

120721	120801	120718	120718	he	394	" Well , there are worse folk than James More , too . But this is dreadful bad . Tut , tut , he must have forgot himself entirely ! This is a most undesirable letter . But , for all that , gentlemen , I can not see what we would want to make it public for . It s an ill bird that fouls his own nest , and we are all Scots folk and all Hieland . "
120914	120924	120926	120926	I.	0	" And let us go see him , then , "
120927	120934	120936	120936	Catriona	189	" If it is your pleasure , "
