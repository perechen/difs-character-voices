269	279	265	265	he	374	" What an extremely nice house to come into ! "
352	364	335	335	Katharine	133	" Now , do you think we 're enjoying ourselves enormously ? "
366	372	373	373	she	133	" Mr. Denham , mother , "
632	657	618	619	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Now , what would you do if you were married to an engineer , and had to live in Manchester , Mr. Denham ? "
658	665	668	672	a thin , elderly gentleman	393	" Surely she could learn Persian , "
674	693	668	672	a thin , elderly gentleman	393	" Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with whom she could read Persian ? "
694	708	709	709	Katharine	133	" A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester , "
821	829	830	830	he	135	" Have you ever been to Manchester ? "
834	837	838	838	she	133	" Never , "
841	851	830	830	he	135	" Why do you object to it , then ? "
994	1009	1010	1010	she	133	" I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester , "
1052	1068	1069	1069	he	136	" In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration , Katharine decidedly hits the mark , "
1211	1217	1219	1220	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Oh , Mr. Fortescue , "
1226	1258	1219	1220	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I had just written to say how I envied her ! I was thinking of the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens , who read nothing but the "
1261	1292	1219	1220	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" and snuff the candles . Have they ALL disappeared ? I told her she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets that depress one so . "
1293	1299	1301	1303	the thin gentleman	417	" There is the University , "
1317	1337	1339	1339	Katharine	133	" I know there are moors there , because I read about them in a book the other day , "
1341	1354	1355	1356	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family , "
1823	1838	1839	1840	her mother	378	" Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada , Katharine ? "
1843	1848	1839	1840	her mother	378	" Trafalgar , mother . "
1849	1906	1839	1840	her mother	378	" Trafalgar , of course ! How stupid of me ! Another cup of tea , with a thin slice of lemon in it , and then , dear Mr. Fortescue , please explain my absurd little puzzle . One ca n't help believing gentlemen with Roman noses , even if one meets them in omnibuses . "
2164	2270	2138	2138	she	140	" D'you know , Mr. Denham , you remind me so much of dear Mr. Ruskin .... Is it his tie , Katharine , or his hair , or the way he sits in his chair ? Do tell me , Mr. Denham , are you an admirer of Ruskin ? Some one , the other day , said to me , ' Oh , no , we do n't read Ruskin , Mrs. Hilbery . ' What DO you read , I wonder ? for you ca n't spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the earth . "
2308	2380	2381	2381	she	433	" I 'm sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things , Katharine . I 'm sure he 's not like that dreadful young man , Mr. Ponting , who told me that he considered it our duty to live exclusively in the present . After all , what IS the present ? Half of it 's the past , and the better half , too , I should say , "
2421	2431	2411	2411	Katharine	133	" Perhaps you would like to see the pictures , "
2619	2622	2609	2609	she	133	" There ! "
2733	2746	2748	2748	she	133	" This is his writing - table . He used this pen , "
2812	2833	2834	2834	she	133	" I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any one is nowadays . This , "
2850	2882	2834	2834	she	133	" is the original manuscript of the ' Ode to Winter . ' The early poems are far less corrected than the later . Would you like to look at it ? "
2987	3000	3001	3001	she	133	" This is a copy of the first edition of the poems , "
3018	3034	3035	3035	She	133	" which contains several poems that have not been reprinted , as well as corrections . "
3055	3156	3035	3035	She	133	" That lady in blue is my great - grandmother , by Millington . Here is my uncle 's walking - stick he was Sir Richard Warburton , you know , and rode with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow . And then , let me see oh , that 's the original Alardyce , 1697 , the founder of the family fortunes , with his wife . Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their crest and initials . We think it must have been given them to celebrate their silver wedding - day . "
3480	3493	3472	3472	he	135	" You must be very proud of your family , Miss Hilbery . "
3494	3500	3501	3501	Katharine	133	" Yes , I am , "
3508	3519	3505	3505	she	133	" Do you think there 's anything wrong in that ? "
3520	3543	3544	3544	he	135	" Wrong ? How should it be wrong ? It must be a bore , though , showing your things to visitors , "
3548	3556	3501	3501	Katharine	133	" Not if the visitors like them . "
3557	3569	3570	3570	he	135	" Is n't it difficult to live up to your ancestors ? "
3573	3585	3586	3586	Katharine	133	" I dare say I should n't try to write poetry , "
3589	3616	3617	3617	Denham	135	" No . And that 's what I should hate . I could n't bear my grandfather to cut me out . And , after all , "
3630	3688	3689	3689	he	135	" it 's not your grandfather only . You 're cut out all the way round . I suppose you come of one of the most distinguished families in England . There are the Warburtons and the Mannings and you 're related to the Otways , are n't you ? I read it all in some magazine , "
3692	3699	3700	3700	Katharine	133	" The Otways are my cousins , "
3703	3706	3708	3708	Denham	135	" Well , "
3724	3727	3729	3729	Katharine	133	" Well , "
3731	3742	3729	3729	Katharine	133	" I do n't see that you 've proved anything . "
3837	3840	3842	3842	Denham	135	" Well , "
3943	3953	3954	3954	Katharine	133	" But are n't you proud of your family ? "
3957	3960	3962	3962	Denham	135	" No , "
3964	3986	3962	3962	Denham	135	" We 've never done anything to be proud of unless you count paying one 's bills a matter for pride . "
3987	3993	3994	3994	Katharine	133	" That sounds rather dull , "
3997	4005	4006	4006	Denham	135	" You would think us horribly dull , "
4009	4029	4030	4030	Katharine	133	" Yes , I might find you dull , but I do n't think I should find you ridiculous , "
4045	4069	4006	4006	Denham	135	" No because we 're not in the least ridiculous . We 're a respectable middle - class family , living at Highgate . "
4070	4088	4030	4030	Katharine	133	" We do n't live at Highgate , but we 're middle class too , I suppose . "
4111	4121	4123	4123	Katharine	133	" That belonged to Clive , so we say , "
4134	4140	4141	4141	Denham	135	" Is it a lie ? "
4144	4161	4102	4102	he	135	" It 's a family tradition . I do n't know that we can prove it . "
4162	4175	4177	4177	Denham	135	" You see , we do n't have traditions in our family , "
4179	4185	4186	4186	Katharine	133	" You sound very dull , "
4194	4199	4200	4200	Denham	135	" Merely middle class , "
4203	4225	4177	4177	Denham	135	" You pay your bills , and you speak the truth . I do n't see why you should despise us . "
4240	4255	4256	4256	he	135	" I should n't like to be you ; that 's all I said , "
4273	4287	4261	4261	he	135	" No , but one never would like to be any one else . "
4288	4302	4261	4261	he	135	" I should . I should like to be lots of other people . "
4303	4309	4310	4310	Katharine	133	" Then why not us ? "
4409	4419	4420	4420	he	135	" You 'll never know anything at first hand , "
4426	4462	4420	4420	he	135	" It 's all been done for you . You 'll never know the pleasure of buying things after saving up for them , or reading books for the first time , or making discoveries . "
4463	4467	4468	4468	Katharine	133	" Go on , "
4496	4510	4511	4511	he	135	" Of course , I do n't know how you spend your time , "
4518	4547	4548	4548	he	135	" but I suppose you have to show people round . You are writing a life of your grandfather , are n't you ? And this kind of thing "
4563	4572	4548	4548	he	135	" must take up a lot of time . "
4606	4615	4616	4616	she	133	" You 've got it very nearly right , "
4619	4633	4616	4616	she	133	" but I only help my mother . I do n't write myself . "
4634	4641	4642	4642	he	135	" Do you do anything yourself ? "
4645	4651	4652	4652	she	133	" What do you mean ? "
4655	4670	4652	4652	she	133	" I do n't leave the house at ten and come back at six . "
4671	4678	4695	4695	Katharine	133	" I do n't mean that . "
4747	4757	4758	4758	she	133	" Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays , "
4761	4764	4765	4765	she	133	" You see "
4774	4809	4765	4765	she	133	" we do n't even print as well as they did , and as for poets or painters or novelists there are none ; so , at any rate , I 'm not singular . "
4810	4820	4821	4821	Denham	135	" No , we have n't any great men , "
4824	4858	4821	4821	Denham	135	" I 'm very glad that we have n't . I hate great men . The worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation . "
5175	5178	5179	5179	she	133	" Well , "
5182	5193	5179	5179	she	133	" how do you like our things , Mr. Denham ? "
5229	5237	5238	5238	she	134	" There are some books that LIVE , "
5241	5357	5238	5238	she	134	" They are young with us , and they grow old with us . Are you fond of poetry , Mr. Denham ? But what an absurd question to ask ! The truth is , dear Mr. Fortescue has almost tired me out . He is so eloquent and so witty , so searching and so profound that , after half an hour or so , I feel inclined to turn out all the lights . But perhaps he 'd be more wonderful than ever in the dark . What d'you think , Katharine ? Shall we give a little party in complete darkness ? There 'd have to be bright rooms for the bores .... "
5366	5378	5379	5380	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But we 've any number of things to show you ! "
5389	5487	5379	5380	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Books , pictures , china , manuscripts , and the very chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of Darnley 's murder . I must lie down for a little , and Katharine must change her dress though she 's wearing a very pretty one , but if you do n't mind being left alone , supper will be at eight . I dare say you 'll write a poem of your own while you 're waiting . Ah , how I love the firelight ! Does n't our room look charming ? "
5515	5519	5520	5520	she	134	" Dear things ! "
5523	5603	5520	5520	she	134	" Dear chairs and tables ! How like old friends they are faithful , silent friends . Which reminds me , Katharine , little Mr. Anning is coming to - night , and Tite Street , and Cadogan Square .... Do remember to get that drawing of your great - uncle glazed . Aunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here , and I know how it would hurt me to see MY father in a broken glass . "
6199	6216	6194	6194	him	454	" She 'll do .... Yes , Katharine Hilbery'll do .... I 'll take Katharine Hilbery . "
7125	7139	7119	7119	her	529	" Mother says , are n't you coming down , Ralph ? Uncle Joseph "
7140	7150	7152	7152	Ralph	158	" They 're to bring my dinner up here , "
7236	7239	7241	7241	Ralph	158	" Ralph ! "
7617	7621	7622	7622	He	158	" Critical Review . "
8051	8061	8069	8069	she	378	" although she 's wearing such a pretty one , "
8297	8300	8288	8289	The person	564	" Ralph ? "
8307	8310	8288	8289	The person	564	" Joan ? "
8311	8323	8288	8289	The person	564	" I was coming up , but I saw your notice . "
8324	8333	8334	8334	He	158	" Well , come along in , then . "
8504	8550	8496	8496	She	160	" It 's about Charles and Uncle John 's offer .... Mother 's been talking to me . She says she ca n't afford to pay for him after this term . She says she 'll have to ask for an overdraft as it is . "
8551	8558	8560	8560	Ralph	158	" That 's simply not true , "
8562	8580	8560	8560	Ralph	158	" No . I thought not . But she wo n't believe me when I say it . "
8607	8613	8614	8614	she	575	" I 'm not interrupting ? "
8640	8653	8654	8654	he	158	" She does n't understand that one 's got to take risks , "
8659	8681	8696	8696	His	158	" I believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was the sort of boy to profit by it . "
8682	8692	8694	8694	Ralph	158	" He 's got brains , has n't he ? "
8740	8776	8723	8723	She	575	" In some ways he 's fearfully backward , though , compared with what you were at his age . And he 's difficult at home , too . He makes Molly slave for him . "
8821	8844	8815	8815	He	158	" which was a proof of it . She sighed involuntarily , and the sigh annoyed Ralph , and he exclaimed with irritation :
8845	8861	8815	8815	He	158	" It 's pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen ! "
8862	8872	8873	8873	she	160	" Nobody WANTS to stick him into an office , "
8975	8980	8981	8981	he	158	" The truth is , "
8985	9010	8981	8981	he	158	" that I ought to have accepted Uncle John 's offer . I should have been making six hundred a year by this time . "
9011	9021	9022	9022	Joan	160	" I do n't think that for a moment , "
9031	9053	9022	9022	Joan	160	" The question , to my mind , is , whether we could n't cut down our expenses in some way . "
9054	9059	9022	9022	Joan	160	" A smaller house ? "
9060	9066	9022	9022	Joan	160	" Fewer servants , perhaps . "
9098	9106	9093	9093	Ralph	158	" It 's out of the question . "
9187	9194	9160	9160	He	158	" If mother wo n't run risks "
9195	9207	9160	9160	He	158	" You really ca n't expect her to sell out again . "
9208	9236	9160	9160	He	158	" She ought to look upon it as an investment ; but if she wo n't , we must find some other way , that 's all . "
9419	9435	9436	9436	she	160	" I think you 'd be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles , "
9439	9464	9436	9436	she	160	" Fond as I am of him , he does n't seem to me exactly brilliant .... Besides , why should you be sacrificed ? "
9465	9470	9471	9471	Ralph	158	" My dear Joan , "
9483	9574	9475	9475	himself	158	" do n't you see that we 've all got to be sacrificed ? What 's the use of denying it ? What 's the use of struggling against it ? So it always has been , so it always will be . We 've got no money and we never shall have any money . We shall just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop and die , worn out , as most people do , when one comes to think of it . "
9600	9608	9594	9594	she	160	" Are n't you happy , Ralph ? "
9609	9639	9594	9594	she	160	" No . Are you ? Perhaps I 'm as happy as most people , though . God knows whether I 'm happy or not . What is happiness ? "
9685	9688	9689	9689	she	575	" Happiness , "
9727	9735	9736	9736	she	575	" Hilda was here to - day , "
9748	9759	9760	9760	Ralph	158	" She brought Bobbie he 's a fine boy now . "
10045	10052	10053	10053	Joan	160	" Shall you talk to mother ? "
10056	10087	10053	10053	Joan	160	" Because , you see , the thing 's got to be settled , one way or another . Charles must write to Uncle John if he 's going there . "
10092	10103	10104	10104	he	158	" I suppose it does n't much matter either way , "
10107	10118	10104	10104	he	158	" He 's doomed to misery in the long run . "
10128	10136	10137	10137	she	160	" You know you 're talking nonsense , "
10140	10165	10137	10137	she	160	" It does n't hurt any one to have to earn their own living . I 'm very glad I have to earn mine . "
10189	10210	10182	10182	he	158	" Is n't that only because you 've forgotten how to enjoy yourself ? You never have time for anything decent "
10211	10216	10182	10182	he	158	" As for instance ? "
10217	10250	10182	10182	he	158	" Well , going for walks , or music , or books , or seeing interesting people . You never do anything that 's really worth doing any more than I do . "
10251	10267	10268	10268	she	160	" I always think you could make this room much nicer , if you liked , "
10271	10302	10182	10182	he	158	" What does it matter what sort of room I have when I 'm forced to spend all the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office ? "
10303	10317	10182	10182	he	158	" You said two days ago that you found the law so interesting . "
10318	10332	10182	10182	he	158	" So it is if one could afford to know anything about it . "
10333	10344	10345	10345	Joan	160	" That 's Herbert only just going to bed now , "
10357	10369	10345	10345	Joan	160	" And then he wo n't get up in the morning . "
10441	10448	10449	10449	he	158	" D'you ever pay calls now ? "
10453	10467	10449	10449	he	158	" I do n't often have the time . Why do you ask ? "
10468	10487	10449	10449	he	158	" It might be a good thing , to get to know new people , that 's all . "
10488	10492	10494	10494	Joan	160	" Poor Ralph ! "
10501	10521	10494	10494	Joan	160	" You think your sister 's getting very old and very dull that 's it , is n't it ? "
10522	10532	10533	10533	he	158	" I do n't think anything of the kind , "
10541	10583	10538	10538	he	158	" But you lead a dog 's life , Joan . When you 're not working in an office , you 're worrying over the rest of us . And I 'm not much good to you , I 'm afraid . "
10930	10934	10935	10935	he	158	" Hereditary Genius , "
11812	11818	11829	11830	her mother	378	" good and great man . "
12066	12070	12060	12061	visitors uncles	701	" from India , "
12096	12102	12060	12061	visitors uncles	701	" remember all your life . "
13370	13478	13362	13362	she	134	" Well done , Katharine ! What a wonderful head for business you 've got ! Now I shall keep this before me , and every day I shall make a little mark in my pocketbook , and on the last day of all let me think , what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all ? If it were n't the winter we could take a jaunt to Italy . They say Switzerland 's very lovely in the snow , except for the cold . But , as you say , the great thing is to finish the book . Now let me see "
15285	15321	15268	15268	her	134	" your wicked old Uncle Judge Peter , who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom . Thank Heaven , Katharine , I 've not a drop of HIM in me ! "
15961	15967	15968	15968	she	179	" And here we are , "
15982	15987	15968	15968	she	179	" talking about art . "
16390	16393	16394	16394	he	158	" Alone ? "
16407	16413	16414	16414	she	179	" I am sometimes alone , "
16417	16426	16427	16427	he	158	" But you expect a great many people , "
16434	16451	16427	16427	he	158	" It 's like a room on the stage . Who is it to - night ? "
16452	16478	16414	16414	she	179	" William Rodney , upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor . I expect a good solid paper , with plenty of quotations from the classics . "
16503	16519	16520	16520	he	158	" I suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own stockings , "
16523	16535	16536	16536	she	179	" I 'm only one of a great many thousands really , "
16539	16599	16536	16536	she	179	" though I must admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in . And now that you 're here I do n't think myself remarkable at all . How horrid of you ! But I 'm afraid you 're much more remarkable than I am . You 've done much more than I 've done . "
16600	16615	16617	16617	Ralph	158	" If that 's your standard , you 've nothing to be proud of , "
16620	16638	16639	16639	she	179	" Well , I must reflect with Emerson that it 's being and not doing that matters , "
16642	16645	16646	16646	Ralph	158	" Emerson ? "
16652	16663	16646	16646	Ralph	158	" You do n't mean to say you read Emerson ? "
16664	16679	16680	16680	she	179	" Perhaps it was n't Emerson ; but why should n't I read Emerson ? "
16689	16716	16646	16646	Ralph	158	" There 's no reason that I know of . It 's the combination that 's odd books and stockings . The combination is very odd . "
16771	16777	16778	16778	she	179	" You always say that , "
16781	16824	16778	16778	she	179	" I assure you it 's a common ' combination , ' as you call it , in the houses of the clergy . The only thing that 's odd about me is that I enjoy them both Emerson and the stocking . "
16834	16846	16831	16831	Ralph	158	" Damn those people ! I wish they were n't coming ! "
16847	16859	16861	16861	Mary	179	" It 's only Mr. Turner , on the floor below , "
16883	16890	16891	16891	Ralph	158	" Will there be a crowd ? "
16898	16935	16970	16970	Mary	179	" There 'll be the Morrises and the Crashaws , and Dick Osborne , and Septimus , and all that set . Katharine Hilbery is coming , by the way , so William Rodney told me . "
16936	16940	16941	16941	Ralph	158	" Katharine Hilbery ! "
16944	16949	16950	16950	Mary	179	" You know her ? "
16957	16969	16970	16970	Mary	179	" I went to a tea - party at her house . "
17012	17027	17028	17028	she	179	" But , in spite of what you say , I do admire her , "
17031	17056	17028	17028	she	179	" I 've only seen her once or twice , but she seems to me to be what one calls a ' personality . ' "
17057	17078	16997	16997	He	158	" I did n't mean to abuse her . I only felt that she was n't very sympathetic to me . "
17079	17092	17028	17028	she	179	" They say she 's going to marry that queer creature Rodney . "
17093	17108	16997	16997	He	158	" Marry Rodney ? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her . "
17109	17119	17120	17120	Mary	179	" Now that 's my door , all right , "
17173	17176	17178	17178	they	847	" Oh ! "
17409	17422	17388	17389	Mr. Rodney	186	" In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry "
17729	17737	17724	17724	Denham	158	" Fancy marrying a creature like that ! "
17965	17993	17941	17941	he	186	" Well , Katharine , I hope I 've made a big enough fool of myself even for you ! It was terrible ! terrible ! terrible ! "
17994	18003	18004	18004	Katharine	133	" Hush ! You must answer their questions , "
18096	18099	18100	18100	he	186	" Idiot ! "
18103	18112	18100	18100	he	186	" He 's misunderstood every word I said ! "
18113	18120	18121	18121	Katharine	133	" Well then , answer him , "
18125	18155	18156	18156	he	186	" No , I sha n't ! They 'd only laugh at me . Why did I let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature ? "
18518	18530	18500	18501	Mary Datchet	179	" That was what I call a first - rate paper . "
18601	18614	18616	18616	Mary	179	" Let 's go and tell him how much we liked it , "
18658	18666	18667	18667	Mary	179	" That was a very interesting paper , "
18685	18697	18667	18667	Mary	179	" Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace ? "
18718	18733	18734	18734	he	180	" Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure ? "
18747	18760	18761	18761	she	133	" He says he does n't mind what we think of him , "
18764	18779	18761	18761	she	133	" He says we do n't care a rap for art of any kind . "
18780	18793	18794	18794	Rodney	180	" I asked her to pity me , and she teases me ! "
18797	18809	18810	18810	Mary	179	" I do n't intend to pity you , Mr. Rodney , "
18818	18838	18810	18810	Mary	179	" When a paper 's a failure , nobody says anything , whereas now , just listen to them ! "
18875	18885	18886	18886	Rodney	180	" D'you think that 's all about my paper ? "
18902	18908	18910	18910	Mary	179	" Of course it is , "
18912	18920	18910	18910	Mary	179	" It was a very suggestive paper . "
18933	18955	18956	18956	he	158	" It 's the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it 's been a success or not , "
18959	18975	18956	18956	he	158	" If I were you , Rodney , I should be very pleased with myself . "
19006	19006	18986	18986	he	180	"
19007	19040	18986	18986	he	180	" Did you agree at all , Denham , with what I said about Shakespeare 's later use of imagery ? I 'm afraid I did n't altogether make my meaning plain . "
19098	19114	19091	19091	He	158	" Did you remember to get that picture glazed before your aunt came to dinner ? "
19391	19404	19405	19405	he	158	" You remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess ? "
19656	19659	19648	19648	she	179	" personality , "
19675	19689	19690	19690	she	179	" They 're exactly like a flock of sheep , are n't they ? "
19711	19723	19724	19724	she	133	" I wonder what they 're making such a noise about ? "
19727	19734	19706	19706	Katharine	133	" The Elizabethans , I suppose . "
19735	19766	19690	19690	she	179	" No , I do n't think it 's got anything to do with the Elizabethans . There ! Did n't you hear them say , ' Insurance Bill ' ? "
19767	19777	19778	19778	Mary	179	" I wonder why men always talk about politics ? "
19781	19795	19778	19778	Mary	179	" I suppose , if we had votes , we should , too . "
19796	19817	19690	19690	she	179	" I dare say we should . And you spend your life in getting us votes , do n't you ? "
19818	19822	19824	19824	Mary	179	" I do , "
19828	19840	19824	19824	Mary	179	" From ten to six every day I 'm at it . "
19878	19895	19896	19896	she	133	" I suppose you 're one of the people who think we should all have professions , "
19915	19920	19922	19922	Mary	179	" Oh dear no , "
19926	19934	19935	19935	Katharine	133	" Well , I think I do , "
19943	19970	19935	19935	Katharine	133	" You will always be able to say that you 've done something , whereas , in a crowd like this , I feel rather melancholy . "
19971	19981	19982	19982	Mary	179	" In a crowd ? Why in a crowd ? "
20005	20030	20031	20031	she	179	" Do n't you see how many different things these people care about ? And I want to beat them down I only mean , "
20035	20055	20033	20033	herself	179	" that I want to assert myself , and it 's difficult , if one has n't a profession . "
20126	20139	20140	20140	Katharine	133	" Ah , but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies ! "
20166	20182	20183	20183	Mary	179	" One does n't necessarily trample upon people 's bodies because one runs an office , "
20186	20192	20193	20193	Katharine	133	" No . Perhaps not , "
20276	20285	20286	20286	she	179	" Yes , they 're very like sheep , "
20291	20301	20302	20302	Katharine	133	" And yet they are very clever at least , "
20305	20314	20302	20302	Katharine	133	" I suppose they have all read Webster . "
20315	20351	20399	20399	Mary	179	" Surely you do n't think that a proof of cleverness ? I 've read Webster , I 've read Ben Jonson , but I do n't think myself clever not exactly , at least . "
20352	20361	20362	20362	Katharine	133	" I think you must be very clever , "
20365	20374	20399	20399	Mary	179	" Why ? Because I run an office ? "
20375	20398	20399	20399	Mary	179	" I was n't thinking of that . I was thinking how you live alone in this room , and have parties . "
20405	20467	20399	20399	Mary	179	" It means , chiefly , a power of being disagreeable to one 's own family , I think . I have that , perhaps . I did n't want to live at home , and I told my father . He did n't like it .... But then I have a sister , and you have n't , have you ? "
20468	20477	20399	20399	Mary	179	" No , I have n't any sisters . "
20478	20488	20489	20489	Mary	179	" You are writing a life of your grandfather ? "
20512	20521	20509	20509	She	133	" Yes , I am helping my mother , "
20602	20605	20595	20595	Mary	179	" egoist . "
20606	20612	20613	20613	she	179	" She 's an egoist , "
20644	20658	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" Heavens , what a mess there 'll be to - morrow morning ! "
20662	20676	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" I hope you do n't sleep in this room , Miss Datchet ? "
20680	20687	20688	20688	Katharine	133	" What are you laughing at ? "
20691	20698	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" I wo n't tell you . "
20699	20716	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" Let me guess . You were laughing because you thought I 'd changed the conversation ? "
20717	20720	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" No . "
20721	20725	20726	20726	She	179	" Because you think "
20729	20747	20726	20726	She	179	" If you want to know , I was laughing at the way you said Miss Datchet . "
20748	20759	20659	20659	Katharine	133	" Mary , then . Mary , Mary , Mary . "
20791	20795	20797	20797	Mary	179	" Mary Datchet , "
20799	20815	20797	20797	Mary	179	" It 's not such an imposing name as Katharine Hilbery , I 'm afraid . "
20968	20984	20985	20985	His	158	" I wonder , Miss Hilbery , whether you remembered to get that picture glazed ? "
20998	21004	21005	21005	Mary	179	" Oh , you idiot ! "
21047	21050	21005	21005	Mary	179	" mensa . "
21051	21056	21057	21057	Katharine	133	" Picture what picture ? "
21060	21088	21057	21057	Katharine	133	" Oh , at home , you mean that Sunday afternoon . Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came ? Yes , I think I remembered it . "
21329	21341	21342	21342	Denham	158	" You know the names of the stars , I suppose ? "
21376	21390	21367	21367	She	133	" I know how to find the Pole star if I 'm lost . "
21391	21402	21367	21367	She	133	" I do n't suppose that often happens to you . "
21403	21413	21414	21414	she	133	" No . Nothing interesting ever happens to me , "
21417	21432	21433	21433	he	158	" I think you make a system of saying disagreeable things , Miss Hilbery , "
21445	21466	21433	21433	he	158	" I suppose it 's one of the characteristics of your class . They never talk seriously to their inferiors . "
21523	21532	21533	21533	she	133	" In what sense are you my inferior ? "
21627	21638	21639	21639	Katharine	133	" I do n't think I understand what you mean , "
22034	22036	22027	22027	his	192	" hum "
22038	22041	22027	22027	his	192	" ha , "
22389	22402	22373	22373	he	158	" I hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth . "
22610	22638	22596	22596	Rodney	180	" I promise I wo n't say another word about it , Katharine ! But do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water . "
22654	22671	22672	22672	she	133	" I 'm sure one can smell the sea , with the wind blowing this way , "
22740	22743	22744	22744	Rodney	180	" Ah ! "
22756	22804	22805	22805	he	180	" why ca n't one say how beautiful it all is ? Why am I condemned for ever , Katharine , to feel what I ca n't express ? And the things I can give there 's no use in my giving . Trust me , Katharine , "
22809	22887	22805	22805	he	180	" I wo n't speak of it again . But in the presence of beauty look at the iridescence round the moon ! one feels one feels Perhaps if you married me I 'm half a poet , you see , and I ca n't pretend not to feel what I do feel . If I could write ah , that would be another matter . I should n't bother you to marry me then , Katharine . "
22908	22919	22921	22921	Katharine	133	" But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage ? "
22931	22978	22980	22980	he	180	" Certainly I should . Not for you only , but for all women . Why , you 're nothing at all without it ; you 're only half alive ; using only half your faculties ; you must feel that for yourself . That is why "
22999	23018	23019	23019	Rodney	180	" With how sad steps she climbs the sky , How silently and with how wan a face , "
23022	23038	23039	23039	Katharine	133	" I 've been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to - night , "
23047	23084	23039	23039	Katharine	133	" Mr. Denham seems to think it his mission to lecture me , though I hardly know him . By the way , William , you know him ; tell me , what is he like ? "
23091	23103	23085	23085	William	180	" We may lecture you till we 're blue in the face "
23104	23112	23019	23019	Rodney	180	" Yes but what 's he like ? "
23113	23129	23130	23130	he	180	" And we write sonnets to your eyebrows , you cruel practical creature . Denham ? "
23138	23182	23130	23130	he	180	" A good fellow , I should think . He cares , naturally , for the right sort of things , I expect . But you must n't marry him , though . He scolded you , did he what did he say ? "
23183	23304	23305	23305	She	965	" What happens with Mr. Denham is this : He comes to tea . I do all I can to put him at his ease . He merely sits and scowls at me . Then I show him our manuscripts . At this he becomes really angry , and tells me I 've no business to call myself a middle - class woman . So we part in a huff ; and next time we meet , which was to - night , he walks straight up to me , and says , ' Go to the Devil ! ' That 's the sort of behavior my mother complains of . I want to know , what does it mean ? "
23325	23341	23305	23305	She	965	" It means , I should say , that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic . "
23353	23370	23371	23371	she	965	" It 's time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house , "
23374	23396	23397	23397	Rodney	180	" Would your mother object to my being seen with you ? No one could possibly recognize us , could they ? "
23430	23476	23427	23427	her	133	" You may laugh , Katharine , but I can tell you that if any of your friends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it , and I should find that very disagreeable . But why do you laugh ? "
23477	23503	23417	23417	she	133	" I do n't know . Because you 're such a queer mixture , I think . You 're half poet and half old maid . "
23504	23532	23427	23427	her	133	" I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous . But I ca n't help having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice . "
23533	23566	23417	23417	she	133	" Nonsense , William . You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire , but that 's no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on the Embankment . "
23567	23590	23427	23427	her	133	" I 'm ten years older than you are , Katharine , and I know more of the world than you do . "
23591	23601	23417	23417	she	133	" Very well . Leave me and go home . "
23638	23653	23629	23629	Katharine	133	" Do n't call that cab for me , William . I shall walk . "
23654	23683	23629	23629	Katharine	133	" Nonsense , Katharine ; you 'll do nothing of the kind . It 's nearly twelve o'clock , and we 've walked too far as it is . "
23708	23713	23714	23714	she	133	" Now , William , "
23717	23750	23714	23714	she	133	" if people see me racing along the Embankment like this they WILL talk . You had far better say good - night , if you do n't want people to talk . "
23779	23794	23795	23795	he	180	" Do n't let the man see us struggling , for God 's sake ! "
23806	23820	23821	23821	she	133	" There 's more of the old maid in you than the poet , "
23913	23931	23932	23932	he	180	" Of all the unreasonable , inconsiderate creatures I 've ever known , she 's the worst ! "
23943	23995	23932	23932	he	180	" Heaven forbid that I should ever make a fool of myself with her again . Why , I 'd sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than Katharine Hilbery ! She 'd leave me not a moment 's peace and she 'd never understand me never , never , never ! "
24195	24198	24199	24199	Rodney	180	" Ha ! "
24319	24326	24327	24327	he	135	" You do well , Denham , "
24331	24367	24368	24368	he	135	" to have nothing to do with young women . I offer you my experience if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent . Not that I have any reason at this moment , "
24372	24412	24368	24368	he	135	" to complain of them . It 's a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason . Miss Datchet , I dare say , is one of the exceptions . Do you like Miss Datchet ? "
24549	24567	24568	24568	he	135	" Yes , I like Mary ; I do n't see how one could help liking her , "
24581	24633	24568	24568	he	135	" Ah , Denham , you 're so different from me . You never give yourself away . I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery . My instinct is to trust the person I 'm talking to . That 's why I 'm always being taken in , I suppose . "
24681	24689	24690	24690	he	135	" Who 's taken you in now ? "
24693	24697	24690	24690	he	135	" Katharine Hilbery ? "
24730	24734	24735	24735	he	135	" Katharine Hilbery , "
24744	24780	24781	24781	he	135	" No , Denham , I have no illusions about that young woman . I think I made that plain to her to - night . But do n't run away with a false impression , "
24842	24963	24964	24964	he	991	" You must not think that I have any bitterness against her far from it . It 's not altogether her fault , poor girl . She lives , you know , one of those odious , self - centered lives at least , I think them odious for a woman feeding her wits upon everything , having control of everything , getting far too much her own way at home spoilt , in a sense , feeling that every one is at her feet , and so not realizing how she hurts that is , how rudely she behaves to people who have n't all her advantages . Still , to do her justice , she 's no fool , "
24978	25011	25012	25012	he	991	" She has taste . She has sense . She can understand you when you talk to her . But she 's a woman , and there 's an end of it , "
25026	25038	25039	25039	Denham	135	" And did you tell her all this to - night ? "
25042	25084	25012	25012	he	991	" Oh dear me , no . I should never think of telling Katharine the truth about herself . That would n't do at all . One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine .
25085	25104	25108	25108	himself	135	" Now I 've learnt that she 's refused to marry him why do n't I go home ? "
25199	25210	25211	25211	he	180	" You 're a slave like me , I suppose ? "
25214	25220	25280	25280	he	135	" A solicitor , yes . "
25221	25249	25280	25280	he	135	" I sometimes wonder why we do n't chuck it . Why do n't you emigrate , Denham ? I should have thought that would suit you . "
25250	25256	25280	25280	he	135	" I 've a family . "
25257	25278	25280	25280	he	135	" I 'm often on the point of going myself . And then I know I could n't live without this "
25324	25416	25280	25280	he	135	" There are one or two people I 'm fond of , and there 's a little good music , and a few pictures , now and then just enough to keep one dangling about here . Ah , but I could n't live with savages ! Are you fond of books ? Music ? Pictures ? D'you care at all for first editions ? I 've got a few nice things up here , things I pick up cheap , for I ca n't afford to give what they ask . "
25582	25609	25610	25610	He	180	" Oh dear me , what a waste of time ! But it 's over now , and so we may think no more about it . "
25671	25676	25678	25678	Rodney	180	" The Baskerville Congreve , "
25686	25697	25678	25678	Rodney	180	" I could n't read him in a cheap edition . "
25958	25961	26096	26096	Denham	135	" Don Giovanni "
25967	25972	25974	25974	Denham	135	" Well , Rodney , "
25986	25995	25977	25977	he	135	" this is all very nice and comfortable . "
26019	26022	26023	26023	he	180	" Tolerable , "
26026	26045	26009	26010	a proprietor	1017	" But I dare say it 's just as well that you have to earn your own living . "
26046	26089	26009	26010	a proprietor	1017	" If you mean that I should n't do anything good with leisure if I had it , I dare say you 're right . But I should be ten times as happy with my whole day to spend as I liked . "
26090	26095	26096	26096	Denham	135	" I doubt that , "
26119	26130	26131	26131	Rodney	180	" I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare , "
26134	26152	26131	26131	Rodney	180	" And there 's music and pictures , let alone the society of the people one likes . "
26153	26166	26009	26010	a proprietor	1017	" You 'd be bored to death in a year 's time . "
26167	26188	26131	26131	Rodney	180	" Oh , I grant you I should be bored if I did nothing . But I should write plays . "
26189	26192	26009	26010	a proprietor	1017	" H'm ! "
26193	26199	26200	26200	he	135	" I should write plays , "
26203	26241	26200	26200	he	135	" I 've written three - quarters of one already , and I 'm only waiting for a holiday to finish it . And it 's not bad no , some of it 's really rather nice . "
26333	26345	26346	26346	Denham	135	" Well , ... will you let me see the play ? "
26392	26403	26404	26404	he	180	" Do you really care for this kind of thing ? "
26439	26454	26432	26432	he	180	" Very few people care for poetry . I dare say it bores you . "
26455	26458	26459	26459	Denham	135	" Perhaps , "
26462	26471	26472	26472	Rodney	180	" Well , I 'll lend it you , "
26526	26530	26481	26481	he	180	" Urn Burial , "
26532	26535	26488	26488	Denham	135	" Hydriotaphia , "
26538	26543	26559	26559	Denham	135	" Garden of Cyrus , "
26682	26691	26692	26692	Denham	135	" I shall look in again some time , "
26711	26716	26700	26700	his	180	" If you like . "
28783	28796	28797	28798	Mrs. Seal	198	" The bare branches against the sky do one so much GOOD , "
28807	28818	28820	28820	Mary	179	" But one ca n't lunch off trees , Sally , "
28822	28837	28838	28839	Mr. Clacton	199	" I confess I do n't know how you manage it , Miss Datchet , "
28842	28866	28838	28839	Mr. Clacton	199	" I should sleep all the afternoon , I know , if I took a heavy meal in the middle of the day . "
28867	28877	28878	28878	Mary	179	" What 's the very latest thing in literature ? "
29028	29037	29024	29024	she	179	" Eleanor , come and sit by me , "
29244	29251	29236	29236	she	179	" I am in love with you "
29359	29362	29363	29363	she	179	" For , "
29382	29409	29363	29363	she	179	" the wonderful thing about you is that you 're ready for anything ; you 're not in the least conventional , like most clever men . "
29437	29445	29446	29446	she	179	" That is what you can do , "
29457	29467	29446	29446	she	179	" You always make people do what you want . "
29505	29513	29489	29489	she	179	" I am in love with you , "
29732	29735	29719	29720	Mrs. Seal	198	" quite splendid "
29737	29744	29745	29745	She	179	" really too bad for words . "
30010	30018	30019	30019	Katharine	133	" No . The S.G.S. top floor . "
30113	30116	30117	30117	she	179	" You ! "
30120	30128	30117	30117	she	179	" We thought you were the printer . "
30139	30173	30174	30174	she	179	" No , Mr. Clacton , it 's not Penningtons . I should ring them up again double three double eight , Central . Well , this is a surprise . Come in , "
30177	30186	30135	30135	she	133	" You 're just in time for tea . "
30297	30309	30310	30310	she	179	" It was very clever of you to find your way , "
30497	30506	30507	30507	she	198	" Always the way , always the way , "
30510	30526	30507	30507	she	198	" Kit Markham is the only person who knows how to deal with the thing . "
30557	30574	30576	30576	Mary	179	" If we had known Miss Hilbery was coming , we should have bought a cake , "
30626	30631	30632	30632	he	199	" Salford 's affiliated , "
30635	30641	30642	30643	Mrs. Seal	198	" Well done , Salford ! "
30662	30677	30679	30680	Mr. Clacton	199	" Yes , these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at last , "
30706	30711	30692	30692	he	199	" in our work . "
30712	30720	30722	30723	Mrs. Seal	198	" And the proofs still not come ? "
30749	30817	30742	30742	Mary	179	" It 's too bad too bad . At this rate we shall miss the country post . Which reminds me , Mr. Clacton , do n't you think we should circularize the provinces with Partridge 's last speech ? What ? You 've not read it ? Oh , it 's the best thing they 've had in the House this Session . Even the Prime Minister "
30824	30835	30836	30836	she	179	" We do n't allow shop at tea , Sally , "
30840	30861	30862	30862	she	179	" We fine her a penny each time she forgets , and the fines go to buying a plum cake , "
30883	30892	30893	30894	Mrs. Seal	198	" I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , "
30897	30907	30908	30908	she	198	" It 's my misfortune to be an enthusiast , "
30915	30989	30990	30990	she	198	" My father 's daughter could hardly be anything else . I think I 've been on as many committees as most people . Waifs and Strays , Rescue Work , Church Work , C. O. S. local branch besides the usual civic duties which fall to one as a householder . But I 've given them all up for our work here , and I do n't regret it for a second , "
30993	31007	30990	30990	she	198	" This is the root question , I feel ; until women have votes "
31008	31019	31021	31021	Mary	179	" It 'll be sixpence , at least , Sally , "
31031	31045	31021	31021	Mary	179	" And we 're all sick to death of women and their votes . "
31065	31071	31073	31073	her	198	" tut - tut - tut "
31110	31140	31141	31141	she	198	" She 's doing more for the cause than any of us . She 's giving her youth for , alas ! when I was young there were domestic circumstances "
31197	31209	31211	31212	Mrs. Seal	198	" Yes , I took my little bag into the square , "
31230	31262	31263	31263	she	198	" It was really very sustaining , and the bare boughs against the sky do one so much GOOD . But I shall have to give up going into the square , "
31270	31300	31263	31263	she	198	" The injustice of it ! Why should I have a beautiful square all to myself , when poor women who need rest have nowhere at all to sit ? "
31315	31388	31301	31301	She	198	" It 's dreadful what a tyrant one still is , in spite of all one 's efforts . One tries to lead a decent life , but one ca n't . Of course , directly one thinks of it , one sees that ALL squares should be open to EVERY ONE . Is there any society with that object , Mr. Clacton ? If not , there should be , surely . "
31389	31395	31400	31400	his	199	" A most excellent object , "
31404	31462	31463	31463	he	199	" At the same time , one must deplore the ramification of organizations , Mrs. Seal . So much excellent effort thrown away , not to speak of pounds , shillings , and pence . Now how many organizations of a philanthropic nature do you suppose there are in the City of London itself , Miss Hilbery ? "
31595	31611	31612	31612	she	133	" Well , there are more in this house than I 'd any notion of , "
31615	31636	31612	31612	she	133	" On the ground floor you protect natives , on the next you emigrate women and tell people to eat nuts "
31637	31650	31651	31651	Mary	179	" Why do you say that ' we ' do these things ? "
31657	31677	31651	31651	Mary	179	" We 're not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge in the same house with us . "
31771	31782	31784	31785	Mrs. Seal	198	" You do n't belong to our society , then ? "
31787	31797	31799	31799	Katharine	133	" No , I 'm afraid I do n't , "
31837	31841	31842	31842	she	133	" But surely , "
31845	31855	31857	31858	Mr. Clacton	199	" Mrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters , "
31863	31886	31857	31858	Mr. Clacton	199	" We have to remind her sometimes that others have a right to their views even if they differ from our own .... "
31888	31911	31928	31929	Mr. Clacton	199	" has a very funny picture this week , about a Suffragist and an agricultural laborer . Have you seen this week 's "
31914	31918	31928	31929	Mr. Clacton	199	" Miss Datchet ? "
31924	31927	31919	31919	Mary	179	" No . "
31982	32007	31978	31978	she	198	" But surely , if you care about the welfare of your sex at all , you must wish them to have the vote ? "
32008	32022	32023	32023	Katharine	133	" I never said I did n't wish them to have the vote , "
32026	32038	32039	32040	Mrs. Seal	198	" Then why are n't you a member of our society ? "
32084	32111	32151	32152	Mrs. Seal	198	" Are you in any way related , I wonder , to the poet Alardyce ? His daughter , I believe , married a Mr. Hilbery . "
32112	32122	32124	32124	Katharine	133	" Yes ; I 'm the poet 's granddaughter , "
32144	32150	32151	32152	Mrs. Seal	198	" The poet 's granddaughter ! "
32184	32195	32196	32196	he	199	" Ah , indeed . That interests me very much , "
32199	32249	32196	32196	he	199	" I owe a great debt to your grandfather , Miss Hilbery . At one time I could have repeated the greater part of him by heart . But one gets out of the way of reading poetry , unfortunately . You do n't remember him , I suppose ? "
32276	32282	32270	32270	her	198	" The proofs at last ! "
32289	32298	32299	32299	she	198	" Oh , it 's only Mr. Denham ! "
32348	32360	32334	32334	Mary	179	" Katharine has come to see how one runs an office . "
32371	32388	32368	32368	he	158	" I hope Mary has n't persuaded you that she knows how to run an office ? "
32389	32396	32398	32398	Katharine	133	" What , does n't she ? "
32458	32534	32450	32450	she	198	" Now , I know what you 're going to say , Mr. Denham ! But it was the day Kit Markham was here , and she upsets one so with her wonderful vitality , always thinking of something new that we ought to be doing and are n't and I was conscious at the time that my dates were mixed . It had nothing to do with Mary at all , I assure you . "
32535	32544	32546	32546	Mary	179	" My dear Sally , do n't apologize , "
32550	32569	32546	32546	Mary	179	" Men are such pedants they do n't know what things matter , and what things do n't . "
32570	32581	32583	32584	Mr. Clacton	199	" Now , Denham , speak up for our sex , "
32621	32626	32615	32615	he	199	" a mere man . "
32649	32661	32662	32662	he	199	" Does n't it seem strange to you , Miss Hilbery , "
32665	32720	32662	32662	he	199	" that the French , with all their wealth of illustrious names , have no poet who can compare with your grandfather ? Let me see . There 's Chenier and Hugo and Alfred de Musset wonderful men , but , at the same time , there 's a richness , a freshness about Alardyce "
32777	32886	32769	32769	herself	198	" For if I were to tell you what I know of back - stairs intrigue , and what can be done by the power of the purse , you would n't credit me , Mr. Denham , you would n't , indeed . Which is why I feel that the only work for my father 's daughter for he was one of the pioneers , Mr. Denham , and on his tombstone I had that verse from the Psalms put , about the sowers and the seed .... And what would n't I give that he should be alive now , seeing what we 're going to see "
32971	32982	32983	32983	she	179	" The standard of morality seems to me frightfully low , "
32995	33037	33038	33038	she	179	" especially among women who are n't well educated . They do n't see that small things matter , and that 's where the leakage begins , and then we find ourselves in difficulties I very nearly lost my temper yesterday , "
33062	33080	33081	33081	she	179	" It makes me very angry when people tell me lies does n't it make you angry ? "
33085	33094	33095	33095	Katharine	133	" But considering that every one tells lies , "
33202	33227	33228	33228	Mary	179	" I do n't think that I tell lies , and I do n't think that Ralph tells lies , do you , Ralph ? "
34128	34148	34118	34118	she	133	" Mary Datchet does that sort of work very well .... She 's responsible for it , I suppose ? "
34149	34168	34118	34118	she	133	" Yes . The others do n't help at all .... Has she made a convert of you ? "
34169	34182	34118	34118	she	133	" Oh no . That is , I 'm a convert already . "
34183	34195	34118	34118	she	133	" But she has n't persuaded you to work for them ? "
34196	34207	34118	34118	she	133	" Oh dear no that would n't do at all . "
34245	34254	34255	34255	he	158	" Suppose we get on to that omnibus ? "
34275	34283	34284	34284	Katharine	133	" But which way are you going ? "
34303	34311	34312	34312	Ralph	158	" I 'm going to the Temple , "
34439	34445	34446	34446	she	133	" This is like Venice , "
34453	34471	34446	34446	she	133	" The motor - cars , I mean , shooting about so quickly , with their lights . "
34472	34479	34480	34480	he	158	" I 've never seen Venice , "
34483	34496	34446	34446	she	133	" I keep that and some other things for my old age . "
34497	34504	34505	34505	she	133	" What are the other things ? "
34508	34523	34446	34446	she	133	" There 's Venice and India and , I think , Dante , too . "
34527	34550	34446	34446	she	133	" Think of providing for one 's old age ! And would you refuse to see Venice if you had the chance ? "
34580	34614	34576	34576	he	158	" I 've planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child , to make it last longer . You see , I 'm always afraid that I 'm missing something "
34615	34621	34622	34622	Katharine	133	" And so am I ! "
34625	34631	34632	34632	she	133	" But , after all , "
34635	34642	34632	34632	she	133	" why should you miss anything ? "
34643	34655	34656	34656	Ralph	158	" Why ? Because I 'm poor , for one thing , "
34659	34678	34656	34656	Ralph	158	" You , I suppose , can have Venice and India and Dante every day of your life . "
34844	34865	34866	34866	she	133	" But to know that one might have things does n't alter the fact that one has n't got them , "
34873	34886	34887	34887	she	133	" How could I go to India , for example ? Besides , "
34920	34930	34931	34931	he	158	" I have a message to give your father , "
34934	34946	34931	34931	he	158	" Perhaps you would give it him , or I could come "
34947	34953	34954	34954	Katharine	133	" Yes , do come , "
34957	34972	34973	34973	Ralph	158	" Still , I do n't see why you should n't go to India , "
35091	35155	35080	35082	the real woman	1195	" And little Augustus Pelham said to me , ' It 's the younger generation knocking at the door , ' and I said to him , ' Oh , but the younger generation comes in without knocking , Mr. Pelham . ' Such a feeble little joke , was n't it , but down it went into his notebook all the same . "
35156	35174	35176	35177	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Let us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave before that work is published , "
35551	35570	35572	35573	Mr. Hilbery	138	" The only excuse for you , Katharine , is that dinner is still later than you are , "
35580	35595	35597	35598	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I do n't mind her being late when the result is so charming , "
35607	35625	35626	35626	she	134	" Still , I do n't know that I LIKE your being out so late , Katharine , "
35629	35638	35626	35626	she	134	" You took a cab , I hope ? "
35877	35883	35884	35884	she	134	" That 's more cheerful , "
35887	35943	35884	35884	she	134	" D'you know , Katharine , that ridiculous goose came to tea with me ? Oh , how I wanted you ! He tried to make epigrams all the time , and I got so nervous , expecting them , you know , that I spilt the tea and he made an epigram about that ! "
35944	35949	35950	35950	Katharine	133	" Which ridiculous goose ? "
35955	35972	35974	35975	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Only one of my geese , happily , makes epigrams Augustus Pelham , of course , "
35977	35987	35989	35989	Katharine	133	" I 'm not sorry that I was out , "
35991	35995	35996	35997	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Poor Augustus ! "
36000	36021	35996	35997	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But we 're all too hard on him . Remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother . "
36022	36037	36073	36074	Mr. Hilbery	138	" That 's only because she is his mother . Any one connected with himself "
36038	36072	35996	35997	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" No , no , Katharine that 's too bad . That 's what 's the word I mean , Trevor , something long and Latin the sort of word you and Katharine know "
36076	36079	36073	36074	Mr. Hilbery	138	" cynical . "
36080	36178	36073	36074	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Well , that 'll do . I do n't believe in sending girls to college , but I should teach them that sort of thing . It makes one feel so dignified , bringing out these little allusions , and passing on gracefully to the next topic . But I do n't know what 's come over me I actually had to ask Augustus the name of the lady Hamlet was in love with , as you were out , Katharine , and Heaven knows what he may n't put down about me in his diary . "
36179	36183	36184	36184	Katharine	133	" I wish , "
36220	36227	36228	36228	he	404	" What is it you wish ? "
36269	36292	36265	36265	her	134	" I wish mother was n't famous . I was out at tea , and they would talk to me about poetry . "
36293	36307	36321	36322	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Thinking you must be poetical , I see and are n't you ? "
36308	36320	36321	36322	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Who 's been talking to you about poetry , Katharine ? "
36343	36397	36321	36322	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" They have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell Square . I never saw such queer - looking people . And the man discovered I was related to the poet , and talked to me about poetry . Even Mary Datchet seems different in that atmosphere . "
36398	36411	36413	36414	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Yes , the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul , "
36416	36436	36437	36438	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I do n't remember any offices in Russell Square in the old days , when Mamma lived there , "
36441	36476	36437	36438	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" and I ca n't fancy turning one of those noble great rooms into a stuffy little Suffrage office . Still , if the clerks read poetry there must be something nice about them . "
36477	36491	36492	36492	Katharine	133	" No , because they do n't read it as we read it , "
36495	36520	36521	36522	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But it 's nice to think of them reading your grandfather , and not filling up those dreadful little forms all day long , "
36555	36577	36578	36579	Mr. Hilbery	138	" At any rate , they have n't made a convert of Katharine , which was what I was afraid of , "
36582	36586	36588	36588	Katharine	133	" Oh no , "
36592	36602	36588	36588	Katharine	133	" I would n't work with them for anything . "
36603	36608	36609	36610	Mr. Hilbery	138	" It 's curious , "
36618	36685	36687	36687	he	138	" how the sight of one 's fellow - enthusiasts always chokes one off . They show up the faults of one 's cause so much more plainly than one 's antagonists . One can be enthusiastic in one 's study , but directly one comes into touch with the people who agree with one , all the glamor goes . So I 've always found , "
37204	37209	37210	37210	she	134	" Oh , Katharine , "
37213	37297	37210	37210	she	134	" how you 've made me think of Mamma and the old days in Russell Square ! I can see the chandeliers , and the green silk of the piano , and Mamma sitting in her cashmere shawl by the window , singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to listen . Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round the corner . It must have been a summer evening . That was before things were hopeless .... "
37718	37725	37726	37726	she	134	" If they 'd lived now , "
37729	37817	37726	37726	she	134	" I feel it would n't have happened . People are n't so set upon tragedy as they were then . If my father had been able to go round the world , or if she 'd had a rest cure , everything would have come right . But what could I do ? And then they had bad friends , both of them , who made mischief . Ah , Katharine , when you marry , be quite , quite sure that you love your husband ! "
37836	37873	37878	37878	she	133	" Now this is what Mary Datchet and Mr. Denham do n't understand . This is the sort of position I 'm always getting into . How simple it must be to live as they do ! "
37898	37903	37904	37905	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But , Katharine , "
37917	37978	37904	37905	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" though , Heaven knows , I do n't want to see you married , surely if ever a man loved a woman , William loves you . And it 's a nice , rich - sounding name too Katharine Rodney , which , unfortunately , does n't mean that he 's got any money , because he has n't . "
38004	38019	38020	38021	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" It 's very dull that you can only marry one husband , certainly , "
38024	38055	38020	38021	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I always wish that you could marry everybody who wants to marry you . Perhaps they 'll come to that in time , but meanwhile I confess that dear William "
38254	38264	38238	38239	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Please , Katharine , read us something REAL . "
38698	38701	38702	38702	she	219	" Remember , "
38712	38766	38702	38702	she	219	" that he bears your grandfather 's name , and so will the child that is to be born . The poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman who deluded him , thinking him a gentleman , which he IS , and having money , which he has NOT . "
38767	38776	38778	38778	Katharine	219	" What would Ralph Denham say to this ? "
38832	38842	38843	38843	she	219	" What would Mary Datchet and Ralph Denham say ? "
39781	39783	39778	39778	Shelley	177	" of "
39786	39789	39778	39778	Shelley	177	" and , "
39802	39806	39832	39832	he	138	" Nag 's Head "
39810	39814	39832	39832	he	138	" Turkish Knight , "
39996	40004	39993	39993	She	219	" Isabella and the Pot of Basil , "
40049	40078	40040	40040	she	219	" I 've had a letter from Aunt Celia about Cyril , father .... It seems to be true about his marriage . What are we to do ? "
40079	40092	40098	40098	his	138	" Cyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner , "
40137	40149	40150	40150	he	404	" He 's about done for himself , I should say , "
40180	40183	40178	40178	he	404	" Humph ! "
40192	40199	40200	40200	Katharine	219	" Mother knows nothing about it , "
40203	40209	40200	40200	Katharine	219	" Will you tell her ? "
40210	40232	40178	40178	he	404	" I shall tell your mother . But I shall tell her that there is nothing whatever for us to do . "
40233	40238	40239	40239	Katharine	219	" But the marriage ? "
40257	40270	40271	40271	he	404	" What in the name of conscience did he do it for ? "
40302	40322	40296	40296	she	219	" Ibsen and Butler .... He has sent me a letter full of quotations nonsense , though clever nonsense . "
40323	40347	40348	40348	he	404	" Well , if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those lines , it 's none of our affair , "
40351	40367	40368	40368	Katharine	219	" But is n't it our affair , perhaps , to make them get married ? "
40373	40383	40384	40385	her father	404	" Why the dickens should they apply to me ? "
40391	40399	40368	40368	Katharine	219	" Only as the head of the family "
40400	40425	40427	40428	Mr. Hilbery	138	" But I 'm not the head of the family . Alfred 's the head of the family . Let them apply to Alfred , "
40456	40475	40476	40476	she	219	" I think , perhaps , the best thing would be for me to go and see them , "
40479	40490	40491	40492	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I wo n't have you going anywhere near them , "
40500	40531	40491	40492	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Indeed , I do n't understand why they 've dragged you into the business at all I do n't see that it 's got anything to do with you . "
40532	40541	40542	40542	Katharine	219	" I 've always been friends with Cyril , "
40545	40556	40557	40558	Mr. Hilbery	138	" But did he ever tell you anything about this ? "
40609	40615	40617	40618	Mr. Hilbery	138	" As to your mother , "
40637	40688	40626	40626	he	138	" you had better tell her the facts . She 'd better know the facts before every one begins to talk about it , though why Aunt Celia thinks it necessary to come , I 'm sure I do n't know . And the less talk there is the better . "
40873	40879	40880	40880	she	219	" Have you told mother ? "
40912	40924	40925	40925	He	138	" My dear child , it went out of my head . "
40941	40969	40927	40927	his	138	" I 'll send a note round from the office .... I 'm late this morning , and I 've any amount of proofs to get through . "
40970	40978	40979	40979	Katharine	219	" That would n't do at all , "
40983	41004	40979	40979	Katharine	219	" She must be told you or I must tell her . We ought to have told her at first . "
41289	41292	41293	41293	she	134	" Katharine , "
41302	41378	41293	41293	she	134	" I 've just made out such a queer , strange thing about your grandfather . I 'm three years and six months older than he was when he died . I could n't very well have been his mother , but I might have been his elder sister , and that seems to me such a pleasant fancy . I 'm going to start quite fresh this morning , and get a lot done . "
42167	42197	42159	42160	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I really believe I 'm bewitched ! I only want three sentences , you see , something quite straightforward and commonplace , and I ca n't find 'em . "
42234	42237	42238	42238	she	134	" Besides , "
42250	42269	42270	42270	She	134	" I do n't believe this 'll do . Did your grandfather ever visit the Hebrides , Katharine ? "
42281	42328	42270	42270	She	134	" My mind got running on the Hebrides , and I could n't help writing a little description of them . Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a chapter . Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on , you know . "
42365	42371	42372	42372	she	219	" It 's very beautiful , "
42375	42391	42372	42372	she	219	" but , you see , mother , we ought to go from point to point "
42392	42398	42399	42400	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Oh , I know , "
42403	42463	42464	42464	she	219	" And that 's just what I ca n't do . Things keep coming into my head . It is n't that I do n't know everything and feel everything who did know him , if I did n't ? , but I ca n't put it down , you see . There 's a kind of blind spot , "
42471	42494	42464	42464	she	219	" there . And when I ca n't sleep o ' nights , I fancy I shall die without having done it . "
42675	42680	42681	42681	she	134	" Surely , Katharine , "
42684	42737	42681	42681	she	134	" the men were far handsomer in those days than they are now , in spite of their odious whiskers ? Look at old John Graham , in his white waistcoat look at Uncle Harley . That 's Peter the manservant , I suppose . Uncle John brought him back from India . "
42906	42911	42912	42912	she	134	" What is nobler , "
42920	43066	42912	42912	she	134	" than to be a woman to whom every one turns , in sorrow or difficulty ? How have the young women of your generation improved upon that , Katharine ? I can see them now , sweeping over the lawns at Melbury House , in their flounces and furbelows , so calm and stately and imperial and the monkey and the little black dwarf following behind , as if nothing mattered in the world but to be beautiful and kind . But they did more than we do , I sometimes think . They WERE , and that 's better than doing . They seem to me like ships , like majestic ships , holding on their way , not shoving or pushing , not fretted by little things , as we are , but taking their way , like ships with white sails . "
43249	43255	43256	43256	she	134	" That 's Janie Mannering , "
43277	43358	43256	43256	she	134	" I must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress was coming to dinner , and tucked up her velvet sleeves she always dressed like an Empress herself , cooked the whole meal , and appeared in the drawing - room as if she 'd been sleeping on a bank of roses all day . She could do anything with her hands they all could make a cottage or embroider a petticoat .
43359	43366	43367	43367	she	134	" And that 's Queenie Colquhoun , "
43375	43492	43367	43367	she	134	" who took her coffin out with her to Jamaica , packed with lovely shawls and bonnets , because you could n't get coffins in Jamaica , and she had a horror of dying there as she did , and being devoured by the white ants . And there 's Sabine , the loveliest of them all ; ah ! it was like a star rising when she came into the room . And that 's Miriam , in her coachman 's cloak , with all the little capes on , and she wore great top - boots underneath . You young people may say you 're unconventional , but you 're nothing compared with her . "
43521	43527	43528	43529	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Ah , you wretch ! "
43532	43727	43528	43529	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" what a wicked old despot you were , in your day ! How we all bowed down before you ! ' Maggie , ' she used to say , ' if it had n't been for me , where would you be now ? ' And it was true ; she brought them together , you know . She said to my father , ' Marry her , ' and he did ; and she said to poor little Clara , ' Fall down and worship him , ' and she did ; but she got up again , of course . What else could one expect ? She was a mere child eighteen and half dead with fright , too . But that old tyrant never repented . She used to say that she had given them three perfect months , and no one had a right to more ; and I sometimes think , Katharine , that 's true , you know . It 's more than most of us have , only we have to pretend , which was a thing neither of them could ever do . I fancy , "
43732	43759	43728	43729	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which , with all your outspokenness , you have n't got . "
43784	43794	43795	43795	she	134	" They must have been good friends at heart , "
43798	43814	43795	43795	she	134	" because she used to sing his songs . Ah , how did it go ? "
43852	43860	43861	43861	she	134	" It 's the vitality of them ! "
43871	43998	43861	43861	she	134	" That 's what we have n't got ! We 're virtuous , we 're earnest , we go to meetings , we pay the poor their wages , but we do n't live as they lived . As often as not , my father was n't in bed three nights out of the seven , but always fresh as paint in the morning . I hear him now , come singing up the stairs to the nursery , and tossing the loaf for breakfast on his sword - stick , and then off we went for a day 's pleasuring Richmond , Hampton Court , the Surrey Hills . Why should n't we go , Katharine ? It 's going to be a fine day . "
44043	44047	44035	44035	Katharine	178	" Aunt Celia ! "
44274	44288	44289	44289	she	1286	" I think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril , mother , "
44294	44311	44289	44289	she	1286	" Aunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married . He has a wife and children . "
44312	44320	44321	44322	Mrs. Milvain	222	" No , he is NOT married , "
44335	44347	44330	44330	herself	222	" He has two children , and another on the way . "
44359	44375	44376	44376	Katharine	178	" We thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you , "
44379	44393	44394	44395	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But I met Cyril only a fortnight ago at the National Gallery ! "
44398	44408	44394	44395	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I do n't believe a word of it , "
44460	44471	44473	44474	Mrs. Milvain	222	" I did n't WISH to believe it , Maggie , "
44476	44499	44473	44474	Mrs. Milvain	222	" For a long time I COULDN'T believe it . But now I 've seen , and I HAVE to believe it . "
44500	44503	44504	44505	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Katharine , "
44508	44516	44504	44505	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" does your father know of this ? "
44520	44524	44525	44526	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Cyril married ! "
44529	44562	44525	44526	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" And never telling us a word , though we 've had him in our house since he was a child noble William 's son ! I ca n't believe my ears ! "
44639	44761	44624	44624	She	222	" I have suspected for some time that he was not happy . There were new lines on his face . So I went to his rooms , when I knew he was engaged at the poor men 's college . He lectures there Roman law , you know , or it may be Greek . The landlady said Mr. Alardyce only slept there about once a fortnight now . He looked so ill , she said . She had seen him with a young person . I suspected something directly . I went to his room , and there was an envelope on the mantelpiece , and a letter with an address in Seton Street , off the Kennington Road . "
44780	44787	44788	44789	Aunt Celia	223	" I went to Seton Street , "
44793	44853	44788	44789	Aunt Celia	223	" A very low place lodging - houses , you know , with canaries in the window . Number seven just like all the others . I rang , I knocked ; no one came . I went down the area . I am certain I saw some one inside children a cradle . But no reply no reply . "
44876	44883	44884	44884	she	223	" I stood in the street , "
44887	44952	44884	44884	she	223	" in case I could catch a sight of one of them . It seemed a very long time . There were rough men singing in the public - house round the corner . At last the door opened , and some one it must have been the woman herself came right past me . There was only the pillar - box between us . "
44953	44961	44962	44963	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" And what did she look like ? "
44966	44978	44982	44983	Mrs. Milvain	222	" One could see how the poor boy had been deluded , "
44990	44994	44995	44996	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Poor thing ! "
44999	45003	45004	45005	Mrs. Milvain	222	" Poor Cyril ! "
45015	45025	45026	45027	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But they 've got nothing to live upon , "
45030	45041	45042	45042	she	134	" If he 'd come to us like a man , "
45046	45109	45042	45042	she	134	" and said , ' I 've been a fool , ' one would have pitied him ; one would have tried to help him . There 's nothing so disgraceful after all But he 's been going about all these years , pretending , letting one take it for granted , that he was single . And the poor deserted little wife "
45110	45117	45118	45119	Aunt Celia	223	" She is NOT his wife , "
45122	45131	45132	45133	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I 've never heard anything so detestable ! "
45275	45286	45287	45287	she	178	" We must realize Cyril 's point of view first , "
45480	45487	45470	45470	she	242	" made a life for herself , "
45498	45503	45504	45504	she	242	" This unhappy business , "
45514	45567	45504	45504	she	242	" If the train had not gone out of the station just as I arrived , I should have been with you before . Celia has doubtless told you . You will agree with me , Maggie . He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the children "
45568	45577	45578	45579	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But does he refuse to marry her ? "
45589	45601	45602	45603	Cousin Caroline	242	" He has written an absurd perverted letter , all quotations , "
45606	45642	45602	45603	Cousin Caroline	242	" He thinks he 's doing a very fine thing , where we only see the folly of it .... The girl 's every bit as infatuated as he is for which I blame him . "
45643	45648	45649	45650	Aunt Celia	223	" She entangled him , "
45681	45699	45701	45702	Cousin Caroline	242	" It 's no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now , Celia , "
45749	45803	45741	45741	her	222	" The mischief 's done , and very ugly mischief too . Are we to allow the third child to be born out of wedlock ? I am sorry to have to say these things before you , Katharine . He will bear your name , Maggie your father 's name , remember . "
45804	45815	45817	45818	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But let us hope it will be a girl , "
45893	45900	45901	45901	she	378	" It 's detestable quite detestable ! "
45932	45950	45951	45951	she	378	" Nowadays , people do n't think so badly of these things as they used to do , "
45954	46074	46075	46075	she	378	" It will be horribly uncomfortable for them sometimes , but if they are brave , clever children , as they will be , I dare say it 'll make remarkable people of them in the end . Robert Browning used to say that every great man has Jewish blood in him , and we must try to look at it in that light . And , after all , Cyril has acted on principle . One may disagree with his principle , but , at least , one can respect it like the French Revolution , or Cromwell cutting the King 's head off . Some of the most terrible things in history have been done on principle , "
46078	46091	46092	46093	Cousin Caroline	242	" I 'm afraid I take a very different view of principle , "
46097	46100	46101	46102	Aunt Celia	223	" Principle ! "
46118	46129	46130	46130	she	223	" I will go to - morrow and see him , "
46133	46147	46148	46149	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself , Celia ? "
46325	46336	46337	46337	she	178	" Perhaps it would be better if I married William , "
48684	48711	48663	48663	She	133	" It 's life that matters , nothing but life the process of discovering the everlasting and perpetual process , not the discovery itself at all . "
48990	48993	48994	48994	she	179	" Now , "
49005	49031	49032	49032	she	179	" I 'm not going to let these silly ideas come into my head .... Do n't you think Mr. Asquith deserves to be hanged ? "
49133	49182	49130	49130	he	158	" How absurd Mary would think me if she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea in order to look at Katharine 's windows . She would n't understand it , but I like her very much as she is . "
49341	49344	49345	49345	he	158	" Here , "
49348	49363	49345	49345	he	158	" is where we differ from women ; they have no sense of romance . "
49364	49369	49370	49370	he	158	" Well , Mary , "
49375	49384	49370	49370	he	158	" why do n't you say something amusing ? "
49414	49427	49409	49409	she	179	" Because I 've got nothing amusing to say , I suppose . "
49438	49451	49452	49452	he	158	" You work too hard . I do n't mean your health , "
49460	49477	49452	49452	he	158	" I mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your work . "
49478	49486	49487	49487	she	179	" And is that a bad thing ? "
49497	49503	49504	49504	he	158	" I think it is , "
49508	49520	49521	49521	Her	179	" But only a week ago you were saying the opposite . "
49677	49686	49687	49687	he	158	" You do n't read enough , Mary , "
49691	49699	49687	49687	he	158	" You ought to read more poetry . "
49787	49800	49802	49802	she	179	" I 'm behaving exactly as I said I would n't behave , "
49815	49826	49802	49802	she	179	" Tell me what I ought to read , then . "
49866	49873	49874	49874	he	158	" You live with your inferiors , "
49888	50048	50049	50049	he	158	" And you get into a groove because , on the whole , it 's rather a pleasant groove . And you tend to forget what you 're there for . You 've the feminine habit of making much of details . You do n't see when things matter and when they do n't . And that 's what 's the ruin of all these organizations . That 's why the Suffragists have never done anything all these years . What 's the point of drawing - room meetings and bazaars ? You want to have ideas , Mary ; get hold of something big ; never mind making mistakes , but do n't niggle . Why do n't you throw it all up for a year , and travel ? see something of the world . Do n't be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life . But you wo n't , "
50052	50069	50071	50071	Mary	179	" I 've rather come to that way of thinking myself about myself , I mean , "
50079	50089	50071	50071	Mary	179	" I should like to go somewhere far away . "
50102	50120	50098	50098	Ralph	158	" But look here , Mary , you have n't been taking this seriously , have you ? "
50153	50163	50164	50164	he	158	" You wo n't go away , will you ? "
50176	50185	50173	50173	he	158	" Oh no , do n't go away . "
50186	50198	50199	50199	she	179	" I do n't know exactly what I mean to do , "
50650	50671	50673	50673	Katharine	133	" It 's life that matters , nothing but life the process of discovering , the everlasting and perpetual process , "
50694	50702	50703	50703	She	133	" not the discovery itself at all . "
50945	50950	50951	50951	she	179	" Well , William , "
50954	50962	50951	50951	she	179	" I 'm afraid I 'm late . "
51228	51236	51225	51225	she	219	" I like your sonnet very much . "
51540	51549	51550	51550	she	219	" My oysters ! I had a basket , "
51553	51580	51550	51550	she	219	" and I 've left it somewhere . Uncle Dudley dines with us to - night . What in the world have I done with them ? "
51605	51614	51591	51591	William	174	" Oysters , oysters your basket of oysters ! "
51661	51666	51667	51667	she	219	" I had them , "
51670	51686	51687	51687	she	219	" in the Strand ; I sat on a seat . Well , never mind , "
51697	51711	51687	51687	she	219	" I dare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time . "
51712	51723	51724	51724	William	174	" I should have thought that you never forgot anything , "
51733	51746	51747	51747	Katharine	219	" That 's part of the myth about me , I know , "
51750	51755	51756	51756	William	174	" And I wonder , "
51763	51783	51784	51784	he	174	" what the truth about you is ? But I know this sort of thing does n't interest you , "
51794	51805	51806	51806	she	219	" No ; it does n't interest me very much , "
51810	51818	51819	51819	he	174	" What shall we talk about then ? "
51833	51882	51822	51822	She	219	" However we start , we end by talking about the same thing about poetry , I mean . I wonder if you realize , William , that I 've never read even Shakespeare ? It 's rather wonderful how I 've kept it up all these years . "
51883	51902	51903	51903	he	174	" You 've kept it up for ten years very beautifully , as far as I 'm concerned , "
51906	51915	51822	51822	She	219	" Ten years ? So long as that ? "
51916	51928	51929	51929	he	174	" And I do n't think it 's always bored you , "
52207	52217	52218	52218	he	174	" You may say you do n't read books , "
52221	52260	52218	52218	he	174	" but , all the same , you know about them . Besides , who wants you to be learned ? Leave that to the poor devils who 've got nothing better to do . You you ahem ! "
52261	52277	52279	52279	Katharine	219	" Well , then , why do n't you read me something before I go ? "
52286	52308	52309	52309	He	174	" Katharine , you 've only just come ! Let me see now , what have I got to show you ? "
52354	52367	52368	52368	he	174	" I believe you only ask me to read out of kindness , "
52372	52388	52368	52368	he	174	" Let 's find something else to talk about . Who have you been seeing ? "
52389	52400	52401	52401	Katharine	219	" I do n't generally ask things out of kindness , "
52404	52419	52401	52401	Katharine	219	" however , if you do n't want to read , you need n't . "
52458	52471	52472	52472	he	174	" One can trust you , certainly , to say unpleasant things , "
52492	52554	52555	52555	He	174	" Ahem ! The Princess is lost in the wood , and she hears the sound of a horn . This would all be very pretty on the stage , but I ca n't get the effect here . Anyhow , Sylvano enters , accompanied by the rest of the gentlemen of Gratian 's court . I begin where he soliloquizes . "
52821	52847	53101	53101	his	1588	" That seems to me extremely well written , William ; although , of course , I do n't know enough to criticize in detail . "
52848	52861	53101	53101	his	1588	" But it 's the skill that strikes you not the emotion ? "
52862	52878	53101	53101	his	1588	" In a fragment like that , of course , the skill strikes one most . "
52879	52922	53101	53101	his	1588	" But perhaps have you time to listen to one more short piece ? the scene between the lovers ? There 's some real feeling in that , I think . Denham agrees that it 's the best thing I 've done . "
52923	52932	52933	52933	Katharine	219	" You 've read it to Ralph Denham ? "
52939	52954	52933	52933	Katharine	219	" He 's a better judge than I am . What did he say ? "
52955	52960	52961	52961	Rodney	219	" My dear Katharine , "
52964	53093	52961	52961	Rodney	219	" I do n't ask you for criticism , as I should ask a scholar . I dare say there are only five men in England whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me . But I trust you where feeling is concerned . I had you in my mind often when I was writing those scenes . I kept asking myself , ' Now is this the sort of thing Katharine would like ? ' I always think of you when I 'm writing , Katharine , even when it 's the sort of thing you would n't know about . And I 'd rather yes , I really believe I 'd rather you thought well of my writing than any one in the world . "
53110	53121	53122	53122	she	219	" You think too much of me altogether , William , "
53137	53146	53147	53147	he	1588	" No , Katharine , I do n't , "
53157	53167	53147	53147	he	1588	" It does me good to think of you . "
53611	53614	53615	53615	she	219	" William , "
53636	53639	53640	53640	she	219	" William , "
53644	53657	53640	53640	she	219	" if you still want me to marry you , I will . "
53772	54375	53769	53770	Mrs. Milvain	222	" ... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram . Such a nice , rich , English name , too , and , in addition , he has all the graces of intellect ; he has read literally EVERYTHING . I tell Katharine , I shall always put him on my right side at dinner , so as to have him by me when people begin talking about characters in Shakespeare . They wo n't be rich , but they 'll be very , very happy . I was sitting in my room late one night , feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again , when I heard Katharine outside in the passage , and I thought to myself , ' Shall I call her in ? ' and then I thought in that hopeless , dreary way one does think , with the fire going out and one 's birthday just over , ' Why should I lay my troubles on HER ? ' But my little self - control had its reward , for next moment she tapped at the door and came in , and sat on the rug , and though we neither of us said anything , I felt so happy all of a second that I could n't help crying , ' Oh , Katharine , when you come to my age , how I hope you 'll have a daughter , too ! ' You know how silent Katharine is . She was so silent , for such a long time , that in my foolish , nervous state I dreaded something , I do n't quite know what . And then she told me how , after all , she had made up her mind . She had written . She expected him to - morrow . At first I was n't glad at all . I did n't want her to marry any one ; but when she said , ' It will make no difference . I shall always care for you and father most , ' then I saw how selfish I was , and I told her she must give him everything , everything , everything ! I told her I should be thankful to come second . But why , when everything 's turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out , why then can one do nothing but cry , nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life 's been a failure , and now is nearly over , and age is so cruel ? But Katharine said to me , ' I am happy . I 'm very happy . ' And then I thought , though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time , Katharine had said she was happy , and I should have a son , and it would all turn out so much more wonderfully than I could possibly imagine , for though the sermons do n't say so , I do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in . She told me that they would live quite near us , and see us every day ; and she would go on with the Life , and we should finish it as we had meant to . And , after all , it would be far more horrid if she did n't marry or suppose she married some one we could n't endure ? Suppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already ?
54376	54587	54690	54691	the girl	411	" And though one never thinks any one good enough for the people one 's fond of , he has the kindest , truest instincts , I 'm sure , and though he seems nervous and his manner is not commanding , I only think these things because it 's Katharine . And now I 've written this , it comes over me that , of course , all the time , Katharine has what he has n't . She does command , she is n't nervous ; it comes naturally to her to rule and control . It 's time that she should give all this to some one who will need her when we are n't there , save in our spirits , for whatever people say , I 'm sure I shall come back to this wonderful world where one 's been so happy and so miserable , where , even now , I seem to see myself stretching out my hands for another present from the great Fairy Tree whose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys , though they are rarer now , perhaps , and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky , but the stars and the tops of the mountains .
54588	54647	53769	53770	Mrs. Milvain	222	" One does n't know any more , does one ? One has n't any advice to give one 's children . One can only hope that they will have the same vision and the same power to believe , without which life would be so meaningless . That is what I ask for Katharine and her husband . "
54650	54661	54662	54662	Denham	158	" Is Mr. Hilbery at home , or Mrs. Hilbery ? "
54677	54689	54690	54691	the girl	411	" No , sir . But Miss Hilbery is at home , "
54864	54870	54871	54871	she	133	" My father is out , "
54874	54886	54871	54871	she	133	" But if you can wait , I expect him soon . "
54939	54950	54951	54951	he	158	" Is that one of the moderns whom you despise ? "
54962	54965	54966	54966	she	133	" Yes , "
54969	54978	54966	54966	she	133	" I think even you would despise him . "
54979	54983	54984	54984	he	158	" Even I ? "
54987	54992	54984	54984	he	158	" Why even I ? "
54993	55007	54966	54966	she	133	" You said you liked modern things ; I said I hated them . "
55037	55048	55049	55049	she	133	" Or did I confess that I hated all books ? "
55063	55066	55049	55049	she	133	" I forget "
55067	55074	55075	55075	he	158	" Do you hate all books ? "
55078	55107	55049	55049	she	133	" It would be absurd to say that I hate all books when I 've only read ten , perhaps ; but ' Here she pulled herself up short .
55108	55111	55049	55049	she	133	" Well ? "
55112	55120	55121	55121	she	133	" Yes , I do hate books , "
55124	55159	55121	55121	she	133	" Why do you want to be for ever talking about your feelings ? That 's what I ca n't make out . And poetry 's all about feelings novels are all about feelings . "
55512	55521	55522	55522	she	133	" My mother wants me to tell you , "
55525	55550	55551	55551	she	133	" that she hopes you have begun your poem . She says every one ought to write poetry .... All my relations write poetry , "
55555	55585	55551	55551	she	133	" I ca n't bear to think of it sometimes because , of course , it 's none of it any good . But then one need n't read it "
55586	55597	55599	55599	Ralph	158	" You do n't encourage me to write a poem , "
55601	55614	55615	55615	she	133	" But you 're not a poet , too , are you ? "
55625	55634	55615	55615	she	133	" Should I tell you if I were ? "
55635	55646	55647	55647	she	133	" Yes . Because I think you speak the truth , "
55701	55707	55708	55708	she	133	" Are you a poet ? "
55740	55752	55753	55753	he	158	" No . I have n't written any poetry for years , "
55756	55779	55753	55753	he	158	" But all the same , I do n't agree with you . I think it 's the only thing worth doing . "
55780	55787	55788	55788	she	133	" Why do you say that ? "
55809	55812	55813	55813	Ralph	158	" Why ? "
55825	55841	55813	55813	Ralph	158	" Because , I suppose , it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise . "
55886	55900	55901	55901	she	133	" I do n't know that there 's much sense in having ideals , "
55904	55910	55911	55911	he	158	" But you have them , "
55915	55933	55911	55911	he	158	" Why do we call them ideals ? It 's a stupid word . Dreams , I mean "
55957	55963	55954	55954	he	158	" Dreams , I mean , "
56033	56037	56038	56038	Katharine	133	" My aunts ! "
56357	56429	56349	56349	she	222	" I come from Woking , Mr. Popham . You may well ask me , why Woking ? and to that I answer , for perhaps the hundredth time , because of the sunsets . We went there for the sunsets , but that was five - and - twenty years ago . Where are the sunsets now ? Alas ! There is no sunset now nearer than the South Coast . "
56499	56506	56507	56507	she	222	" Where are the sunsets now ? "
56510	56520	56507	56507	she	222	" Do you find sunsets now , Mr. Popham ? "
56521	56527	56528	56528	he	158	" I live at Highgate , "
56531	56549	56550	56550	she	222	" At Highgate ? Yes , Highgate has its charms ; your Uncle John lived at Highgate , "
56583	56654	56656	56656	she	222	" I dare say there are very pretty lanes in Highgate . I can recollect walking with your mother , Katharine , through lanes blossoming with wild hawthorn . But where is the hawthorn now ? You remember that exquisite description in De Quincey , Mr. Popham ? but I forget , you , in your generation , with all your activity and enlightenment , at which I can only marvel "
56663	56688	56577	56577	she	222	" do not read De Quincey . You have your Belloc , your Chesterton , your Bernard Shaw why should you read De Quincey ? "
56689	56697	56698	56698	Ralph	158	" But I do read De Quincey , "
56701	56710	56698	56698	Ralph	158	" more than Belloc and Chesterton , anyhow . "
56711	56714	56716	56717	Mrs. Cosham	156	" Indeed ! "
56728	56754	56716	56717	Mrs. Cosham	156	" You are , then , a ' rara avis ' in your generation . I am delighted to meet anyone who reads De Quincey . "
56778	56784	56756	56756	she	156	" Does your friend WRITE ? "
56785	56789	56791	56791	Katharine	133	" Mr. Denham , "
56802	56813	56791	56791	Katharine	133	" writes for the Review . He is a lawyer . "
56814	56844	56869	56869	her	222	" The clean - shaven lips , showing the expression of the mouth ! I recognize them at once . I always feel at home with lawyers , Mr. Denham "
56845	56858	56859	56860	Mrs. Milvain	222	" They used to come about so much in the old days , "
56881	56889	56890	56890	she	222	" You say you live at Highgate , "
56893	56921	56890	56890	she	222	" I wonder whether you happen to know if there is an old house called Tempest Lodge still in existence an old white house in a garden ? "
56931	56975	56976	56976	she	222	" Ah , no ; it must have been pulled down by this time , with all the other old houses . There were such pretty lanes in those days . That was how your uncle met your Aunt Emily , you know , "
56980	56988	56976	56976	she	222	" They walked home through the lanes . "
56989	56998	56999	57000	Mrs. Cosham	156	" A sprig of May in her bonnet , "
57005	57023	56999	57000	Mrs. Cosham	156	" And next Sunday he had violets in his buttonhole . And that was how we guessed . "
57068	57087	57088	57088	she	133	" Uncle John yes , ' poor John , ' you always called him . Why was that ? "
57109	57134	57135	57136	Mrs. Milvain	222	" That was what his father , old Sir Richard , always called him . Poor John , or the fool of the family , "
57142	57202	57203	57203	she	222	" The other boys were so brilliant , and he could never pass his examinations , so they sent him to India a long voyage in those days , poor fellow . You had your own room , you know , and you did it up . But he will get his knighthood and a pension , I believe , "
57210	57217	57203	57203	she	222	" only it is not England . "
57218	57221	57222	57223	Mrs. Cosham	156	" No , "
57227	57271	57272	57272	she	222	" it is not England . In those days we thought an Indian Judgeship about equal to a county - court judgeship at home . His Honor a pretty title , but still , not at the top of the tree . However , "
57275	57306	57307	57307	she	222	" if you have a wife and seven children , and people nowadays very quickly forget your father 's name well , you have to take what you can get , "
57310	57315	57316	57317	Mrs. Milvain	222	" And I fancy , "
57326	57447	57448	57448	she	1651	" that John would have done more if it had n't been for his wife , your Aunt Emily . She was a very good woman , devoted to him , of course , but she was not ambitious for him , and if a wife is n't ambitious for her husband , especially in a profession like the law , clients soon get to know of it . In our young days , Mr. Denham , we used to say that we knew which of our friends would become judges , by looking at the girls they married . And so it was , and so , I fancy , it always will be . I do n't think , "
57457	57471	57448	57448	she	1651	" that any man is really happy unless he succeeds in his profession . "
57507	57608	57497	57497	her	156	" No , men are not the same as women . I fancy Alfred Tennyson spoke the truth about that as about many other things . How I wish he 'd lived to write ' The Prince ' a sequel to ' The Princess ' ! I confess I 'm almost tired of Princesses . We want some one to show us what a good man can be . We have Laura and Beatrice , Antigone and Cordelia , but we have no heroic man . How do you , as a poet , account for that , Mr. Denham ? "
57609	57616	57618	57618	Ralph	158	" I 'm not a poet , "
57623	57630	57618	57618	Ralph	158	" I 'm only a solicitor . "
57631	57638	57639	57640	Mrs. Cosham	156	" But you write , too ? "
57662	57668	57669	57669	Denham	158	" In my spare time , "
57673	57679	57680	57681	Mrs. Cosham	156	" In your spare time ! "
57684	57694	57680	57681	Mrs. Cosham	156	" That is a proof of devotion , indeed . "
57831	57842	57843	57843	she	156	" Um um Pendennis Warrington I could never forgive Laura , "
57847	57965	57843	57843	she	156	" for not marrying George , in spite of everything . George Eliot did the very same thing ; and Lewes was a little frog - faced man , with the manner of a dancing master . But Warrington , now , had everything in his favor ; intellect , passion , romance , distinction , and the connection was a mere piece of undergraduate folly . Arthur , I confess , has always seemed to me a bit of a fop ; I ca n't imagine how Laura married him . But you say you 're a solicitor , Mr. Denham . Now there are one or two things I should like to ask you about Shakespeare "
57988	58067	57966	57966	She	156	" They say , nowadays , that Shakespeare was a lawyer . They say , that accounts for his knowledge of human nature . There 's a fine example for you , Mr. Denham . Study your clients , young man , and the world will be the richer one of these days , I have no doubt . Tell me , how do we come out of it , now ; better or worse than you expected ? "
58088	58111	58084	58084	Ralph	158	" Worse , Mrs. Cosham , a good deal worse . I 'm afraid the ordinary man is a bit of a rascal "
58112	58118	58187	58187	she	156	" And the ordinary woman ? "
58119	58130	58084	58084	Ralph	158	" No , I do n't like the ordinary woman either "
58131	58149	58187	58187	she	156	" Ah , dear me , I 've no doubt that 's very true , very true . "
58154	58163	58150	58151	Mrs. Cosham	156	" Swift would have agreed with you , anyhow "
58196	58207	58208	58209	Mrs. Milvain	222	" Charles Lavington , you remember , was a solicitor , "
58233	58243	58208	58209	Mrs. Milvain	222	" But you would n't remember him , Katharine . "
58244	58255	58257	58257	Katharine	133	" Mr. Lavington ? Oh , yes , I do , "
58268	58296	58257	58257	Katharine	133	" The summer we had a house near Tenby . I remember the field and the pond with the tadpoles , and making haystacks with Mr. Lavington . "
58297	58309	58310	58311	Mrs. Cosham	156	" She is right . There WAS a pond with tadpoles , "
58314	58335	58310	58311	Mrs. Cosham	156	" Millais made studies of it for ' Ophelia . ' Some say that is the best picture he ever painted "
58336	58357	58257	58257	Katharine	133	" And I remember the dog chained up in the yard , and the dead snakes hanging in the toolhouse . "
58358	58371	58372	58373	Mrs. Milvain	222	" It was at Tenby that you were chased by the bull , "
58376	58436	58437	58437	she	222	" But that you could n't remember , though it 's true you were a wonderful child . Such eyes she had , Mr. Denham ! I used to say to her father , ' She 's watching us , and summing us all up in her little mind . ' And they had a nurse in those days , "
58450	58573	58437	58437	she	222	" who was a good woman , but engaged to a sailor . When she ought to have been attending to the baby , her eyes were on the sea . And Mrs. Hilbery allowed this girl Susan her name was to have him to stay in the village . They abused her goodness , I 'm sorry to say , and while they walked in the lanes , they stood the perambulator alone in a field where there was a bull . The animal became enraged by the red blanket in the perambulator , and Heaven knows what might have happened if a gentleman had not been walking by in the nick of time , and rescued Katharine in his arms ! "
58574	58587	58589	58589	Katharine	133	" I think the bull was only a cow , Aunt Celia , "
58591	58632	58437	58437	she	222	" My darling , it was a great red Devonshire bull , and not long after it gored a man to death and had to be destroyed . And your mother forgave Susan a thing I could never have done . "
58633	58649	58651	58652	Mrs. Cosham	156	" Maggie 's sympathies were entirely with Susan and the sailor , I am sure , "
58657	58665	58666	58666	she	133	" My sister - in - law , "
58669	58696	58666	58666	she	133	" has laid her burdens upon Providence at every crisis in her life , and Providence , I must confess , has responded nobly , so far "
58697	58700	58702	58702	Katharine	133	" Yes , "
58721	58735	58709	58709	she	133	" My mother 's bulls always turn into cows at the critical moment . "
58736	58739	58741	58742	Mrs. Milvain	222	" Well , "
58744	58759	58741	58742	Mrs. Milvain	222	" I 'm glad you have some one to protect you from bulls now . "
58760	58772	58774	58774	Katharine	133	" I ca n't imagine William protecting any one from bulls , "
58800	58805	58806	58806	He	158	" Measure for Measure . "
58880	58885	58888	58888	Katharine	133	" I like rubies , "
58891	58911	58912	58913	Mrs. Cosham	156	" To be imprison'd in the viewless winds , And blown with restless violence round about The pendant world .... "
58920	58922	58912	58913	Mrs. Cosham	156	" Rodney "
58926	58928	58912	58913	Mrs. Cosham	156	" William "
59048	59060	59026	59026	He	158	" And have you settled upon a house yet , Katharine ? "
59080	59089	59072	59072	He	158	" Yes , it 's a difficult passage . "
59178	59186	59187	59187	she	219	" Katharine 's engaged to William Rodney , "
59198	59217	59187	59187	she	219	" a very old friend of ours . He has a wonderful knowledge of literature , too wonderful . "
59225	59232	59220	59220	her	219	" You should meet each other . "
59322	59329	59330	59330	she	219	" My father will be back , "
59333	59340	59342	59342	she	219	" Wo n't you sit down ? "
59370	59376	59377	59377	he	158	" I must congratulate you , "
59380	59387	59377	59377	he	158	" It was news to me . "
59402	59406	59407	59407	she	219	" My engagement ? "
59410	59421	59407	59407	she	219	" Yes , I am going to marry William Rodney . "
59473	59480	59481	59481	he	158	" Well , I must go , "
59501	59513	59514	59514	she	219	" You will come again , I hope . We always seem "
59516	59521	59486	59486	She	219	" to be interrupted . "
60155	60164	60165	60165	he	158	" In what can one trust , then ? "
60188	60219	60182	60182	he	158	" In what can one trust ? Not in men and women . Not in one 's dreams about them . There 's nothing nothing , nothing left at all . "
60809	60814	60815	60815	he	158	" Gracious , Mary ! "
60818	60824	60815	60815	he	158	" How you startled me ! "
60825	60839	60840	60840	she	179	" Yes . You looked as if you were walking in your sleep , "
60843	60861	60840	60840	she	179	" Are you arranging some terrible love affair ? Have you got to reconcile a desperate couple ? "
60862	60871	60872	60872	Ralph	158	" I was n't thinking about my work , "
60878	60893	60894	60894	he	158	" And , besides , that sort of thing 's not in my line , "
61008	61017	61018	61018	Mary	179	" I 've never seen sparrows so tame , "
61027	61030	61032	61032	Ralph	158	" No , "
61034	61063	61032	61032	Ralph	158	" The sparrows in Hyde Park are n't as tame as this . If we keep perfectly still , I 'll get one to settle on my arm . "
61105	61108	61109	61109	he	158	" Done ! "
61201	61215	61216	61216	he	158	" That 's what always happens just as I 've almost got him , "
61219	61251	61216	61216	he	158	" Here 's your sixpence , Mary . But you 've only got it thanks to that brute of a boy . They ought n't to be allowed to bowl hoops here "
61252	61269	61343	61343	She	179	" Ought n't to be allowed to bowl hoops ! My dear Ralph , what nonsense ! "
61270	61276	61277	61277	he	158	" You always say that , "
61280	61331	61277	61277	he	158	" and it is n't nonsense . What 's the point of having a garden if one ca n't watch birds in it ? The street does all right for hoops . And if children ca n't be trusted in the streets , their mothers should keep them at home . "
61368	61373	61374	61374	she	179	" Ah , well , "
61377	61406	61374	61374	she	179	" London 's a fine place to live in . I believe I could sit and watch people all day long . I like my fellow - creatures .... "
61411	61425	61426	61426	she	179	" Yes , I think so , when you come to know them , "
61437	61448	61449	61449	he	158	" That 's just when I do n't like them , "
61452	61472	61473	61473	He	158	" Still , I do n't see why you should n't cherish that illusion , if it pleases you . "
61487	61498	61499	61499	Mary	179	" Wake up , Ralph ! You 're half asleep ! "
61508	61528	61499	61499	Mary	179	" What have you been doing with yourself ? Moping ? Working ? Despising the world , as usual ? "
61545	61558	61541	61541	she	179	" It 's a bit of a pose , is n't it ? "
61559	61566	61567	61567	he	158	" Not more than most things , "
61570	61573	61574	61574	Mary	179	" Well , "
61577	61598	61574	61574	Mary	179	" I 've a great deal to say to you , but I must go on we have a committee . "
61612	61621	61622	61622	she	179	" You do n't look happy , Ralph , "
61625	61635	61622	61622	she	179	" Is it anything , or is it nothing ? "
61686	61692	61693	61693	he	158	" I 've been bothered , "
61698	61727	61693	61693	he	158	" Partly by work , and partly by family troubles . Charles has been behaving like a fool . He wants to go out to Canada as a farmer "
61728	61740	61742	61742	Mary	179	" Well , there 's something to be said for that , "
61920	61931	61932	61932	he	158	" What d'you want to sit on a committee for ? "
61935	61945	61932	61932	he	158	" It 's waste of your time , Mary . "
61946	61961	61962	61962	she	179	" I agree with you that a country walk would benefit the world more , "
61965	61969	61970	61970	she	179	" Look here , "
61974	61994	61970	61970	she	179	" why do n't you come to us at Christmas ? It 's almost the best time of year . "
61995	62002	62003	62003	Ralph	158	" Come to you at Disham ? "
62006	62023	62024	62024	she	179	" Yes . We wo n't interfere with you . But you can tell me later , "
62083	62098	62099	62099	she	179	" If I ca n't face a walk in a field alone with Ralph , "
62102	62135	62099	62099	she	179	" I 'd better buy a cat and live in a lodging at Ealing , like Sally Seal and he wo n't come . Or did he mean that he WOULD come ? "
62386	62393	62394	62395	Mrs. Seal	198	" Miss Markham has already arrived , "
62402	62409	62394	62395	Mrs. Seal	198	" and this is her dog . "
62410	62418	62420	62420	Mary	179	" A very fine dog , too , "
62428	62435	62436	62437	Mrs. Seal	198	" Yes . A magnificent fellow , "
62440	62507	62520	62520	she	198	" A kind of St. Bernard , she tells me so like Kit to have a St. Bernard . And you guard your mistress well , do n't you , Sailor ? You see that wicked men do n't break into her larder when she 's out at HER work helping poor souls who have lost their way .... But we 're late we must begin ! "
62783	62798	62766	62766	he	199	" I fancy , ladies and gentlemen , that we are ready to commence . "
63720	63731	63713	63713	she	179	" My friends think all this kind of thing useless . "
63744	63755	63757	63758	Miss Markham	201	" Oh , they 're that sort , are they ? "
63884	63894	63895	63895	she	179	" What do I matter compared with the cause ? "
63937	63945	63934	63934	she	179	" Action ! everywhere ! at once ! "
64281	64318	64272	64272	Mary	179	" If I liked I could make you go in there or stop short ; I could make you walk in single file or in double file ; I could do what I liked with you . "
64328	64341	64342	64342	Mary	179	" Ought n't you to put something round your shoulders , Sally ? "
64375	64383	64384	64384	Mary	179	" Well , did you enjoy yourself ? "
64426	64469	64392	64393	Mrs. Seal	198	" Ah , if only one could get every one of those people into this room , and make them understand for five minutes ! But they MUST see the truth some day .... If only one could MAKE them see it .... "
64527	64534	64535	64535	she	198	" Let 's have our tea , "
64549	64563	64564	64564	she	198	" It was a good meeting did n't you think so , Sally ? "
64590	64601	64603	64603	Sally	202	" But we go at such a snail 's pace , "
64624	64631	64633	64633	Sally	202	" You can afford to laugh , "
64642	64675	64639	64639	her	202	" but I ca n't . I 'm fifty - five , and I dare say I shall be in my grave by the time we get it if we ever do . "
64676	64689	64691	64691	Mary	179	" Oh , no , you wo n't be in your grave , "
64695	64704	64706	64707	Mrs. Seal	198	" It 'll be such a great day , "
64716	64794	64706	64707	Mrs. Seal	198	" A great day , not only for us , but for civilization . That 's what I feel , you know , about these meetings . Each one of them is a step onwards in the great march humanity , you know . We do want the people after us to have a better time of it and so many do n't see it . I wonder how it is that they do n't see it ? "
64854	64873	64874	64874	she	198	" You must n't wear yourself out , Sally , if you want to see the great day , "
64892	64906	64907	64907	she	198	" My dear child , what else is my old body good for ? "
64921	65023	64907	64907	she	198	" Should n't I be proud to give everything I have to the cause ? for I 'm not an intelligence like you . There were domestic circumstances I 'd like to tell you one of these days so I say foolish things . I lose my head , you know . You do n't . Mr. Clacton does n't . It 's a great mistake , to lose one 's head . But my heart 's in the right place . And I 'm so glad Kit has a big dog , for I did n't think her looking well . "
65689	65706	65707	65707	Katharine	219	" We were passing and saw a light in your window , so we came up , "
65723	65732	65734	65734	William	180	" We have been to see some pictures , "
65736	65741	65742	65742	he	180	" Oh , dear , "
65749	65815	65742	65742	he	180	" this room reminds me of one of the worst hours in my existence when I read a paper , and you all sat round and jeered at me . Katharine was the worst . I could feel her gloating over every mistake I made . Miss Datchet was kind . Miss Datchet just made it possible for me to get through , I remember . "
65884	65896	65898	65898	Katharine	219	" We have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery , "
65941	65950	65951	65951	William	180	" Would you believe it , Miss Datchet , "
65954	66008	65951	65951	William	180	" Katharine does n't like Titian . She does n't like apricots , she does n't like peaches , she does n't like green peas . She likes the Elgin marbles , and gray days without any sun . She 's a typical example of the cold northern nature . I come from Devonshire "
66082	66087	66088	66088	she	219	" Perhaps , Mary , "
66092	66148	66149	66149	She	219	" you would n't mind giving us some tea ? We did try to get some , but the shop was so crowded , and in the next one there was a band playing ; and most of the pictures , at any rate , were very dull , whatever you may say , William . "
66170	66179	66180	66180	she	179	" What in the world are they after ? "
66239	66242	66243	66243	she	219	" William , "
66246	66262	66243	66243	she	219	" thinks that perhaps you do n't know . We are going to be married . "
66297	66302	66303	66303	Katharine	219	" Let me see , "
66306	66338	66303	66303	Katharine	219	" one puts hot water into the cups first , does n't one ? You have some dodge of your own , have n't you , William , about making tea ? "
66634	66640	66642	66642	Katharine	219	" Your tea , William , "
66718	66724	66707	66707	she	219	" Your tea , William , "
66812	66830	66831	66831	she	179	" I wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as well as books ? "
66834	66842	66843	66843	William	180	" How do I find the time ? "
66856	66959	66960	66960	he	1816	" Why , I always travel with a notebook . And I ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning . And then I meet men , and talk to them . There 's a man in my office who knows all about the Flemish school . I was telling Miss Datchet about the Flemish school . I picked up a lot of it from him it 's a way men have Gibbons , his name is . You must meet him . We 'll ask him to lunch . And this not caring about art , "
66967	67010	67012	67012	he	1816	" it 's one of Katharine 's poses , Miss Datchet . Did you know she posed ? She pretends that she 's never read Shakespeare . And why should she read Shakespeare , since she IS Shakespeare Rosalind , you know , "
67044	67047	67041	67041	he	1816	" the sex "
67049	67053	67041	67041	he	1816	" the ladies . "
67068	67107	67061	67061	Rodney	180	" She knows enough enough for all decent purposes . What do you women want with learning , when you have so much else everything , I should say everything . Leave us something , eh , Katharine ? "
67108	67113	67115	67115	Katharine	219	" Leave you something ? "
67124	67132	67115	67115	Katharine	219	" I was thinking we must be going "
67133	67154	67156	67156	Rodney	180	" Is it to - night that Lady Ferrilby dines with us ? No , we must n't be late , "
67160	67174	67175	67175	he	180	" D'you know the Ferrilbys , Miss Datchet ? They own Trantem Abbey , "
67187	67208	67175	67175	he	180	" And if Katharine makes herself very charming to - night , perhaps'll lend it to us for the honeymoon . "
67209	67225	67227	67227	Katharine	219	" I agree that may be a reason . Otherwise she 's a dull woman , "
67229	67233	67234	67234	she	219	" At least , "
67244	67254	67234	67234	she	219	" I find it difficult to talk to her . "
67255	67278	67279	67279	he	180	" Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble . I 've seen her sit silent a whole evening , "
67293	67316	67279	67279	he	180	" Do n't you find that , too ? Sometimes when we 're alone , I 've counted the time on my watch "
67330	67366	67318	67318	he	180	" the time between one remark and the next . And once I counted ten minutes and twenty seconds , and then , if you 'll believe me , she only said ' Um ! ' "
67367	67375	67376	67376	Katharine	219	" I 'm sure I 'm sorry , "
67379	67396	67376	67376	Katharine	219	" I know it 's a bad habit , but then , you see , at home "
67480	67492	67493	67493	She	219	" I think being engaged is very bad for the character . "
69038	69044	69046	69046	Elizabeth	288	" But that 's absurd , "
69057	69094	69046	69046	Elizabeth	288	" There are five spare rooms , even when the boys are here . Besides , he would n't get a room in the village . And he ought n't to work if he 's overworked . "
69095	69109	69110	69110	Mary	179	" But perhaps he does n't want to see so much of us , "
69159	69172	69173	69173	Mary	179	" If Ralph were here , he 'd find this very dull , "
69282	69291	69292	69292	she	179	" A flower for your buttonhole , father , "
69299	69304	69306	69307	Mr. Datchet	1891	" Eh , dear ? "
69331	69369	69306	69307	Mr. Datchet	1891	" Where does this fellow come from ? One of Elizabeth 's roses I hope you asked her leave . Elizabeth does n't like having her roses picked without her leave , and quite right , too . "
69423	69426	69428	69428	Mary	179	" What ? "
69502	69512	69491	69491	She	179	" The garden 's looking very nice , father . "
69513	69520	69522	69523	Mr. Datchet	1893	" Yes , yes , yes , "
69562	69624	69558	69558	he	1893	" The traffic 's very much increased , you know . More rolling - stock needed already . Forty trucks went down yesterday by the 12.15 counted them myself . They 've taken off the 9.3 , and given us an 8.30 instead suits the business men , you know . You came by the old 3.10 yesterday , I suppose ? "
69627	69630	69625	69625	She	1895	" Yes , "
70242	70250	70251	70251	he	158	" Stogdon House , Lampsher , Lincoln , "
70255	70266	70268	70269	the man	4696	" You 'll find somebody to direct you at Lincoln , "
70286	70296	70297	70297	he	158	" I 've got to walk over from Disham , "
71171	71176	71177	71177	she	179	" Well , Ralph , "
71180	71231	71177	71177	she	179	" this is better than Lincoln 's Inn Fields , is n't it ? Look , there 's a bird for you ! Oh , you 've brought glasses , have you ? Edward and Christopher mean to make you shoot . Can you shoot ? I should n't think so "
71232	71240	71242	71242	Ralph	158	" Look here , you must explain , "
71244	71256	71242	71242	Ralph	158	" Who are these young men ? Where am I staying ? "
71257	71267	71268	71268	she	179	" You are staying with us , of course , "
71272	71290	71268	71268	she	179	" Of course , you 're staying with us you do n't mind coming , do you ? "
71291	71302	71303	71303	he	158	" If I had , I should n't have come , "
71363	71379	71380	71380	he	158	" This is the sort of country I thought you 'd live in , Mary , "
71396	71405	71380	71380	he	158	" Real country . No gentlemen 's seats . "
71429	71441	71443	71443	Mary	179	" Now we have to find our way through a hedge , "
71468	71478	71480	71480	Mary	179	" It 's quite right that they should poach , "
71489	71523	71524	71524	she	179	" I wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins or Sid Rankin ? How can one expect them not to , when they only make fifteen shillings a week ? Fifteen shillings a week , "
71557	71568	71524	71524	she	179	" I could live on fifteen shillings a week easily . "
71569	71573	71575	71575	Ralph	158	" Could you ? "
71577	71585	71586	71586	he	158	" I do n't believe you could , "
71589	71616	71618	71618	Mary	179	" Oh yes . They have a cottage thrown in , and a garden where one can grow vegetables . It would n't be half bad , "
71629	71638	71639	71639	he	158	" But you 'd get tired of it , "
71642	71658	71659	71659	she	179	" I sometimes think it 's the only thing one would never get tired of , "
71693	71729	71639	71639	he	158	" But would n't it be on the main road , or next door to a woman with six squalling children , who 'd always be hanging her washing out to dry across your garden ? "
71730	71745	71789	71789	Ralph	158	" The cottage I 'm thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard . "
71746	71753	71754	71754	he	158	" And what about the Suffrage ? "
71760	71774	71775	71775	she	179	" Oh , there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage , "
71876	71885	71886	71886	he	158	" D'you know the points of the compass ? "
71889	71895	71897	71897	Mary	179	" Well , of course , "
71899	71911	71897	71897	Mary	179	" What d'you take me for ? a Cockney like you ? "
71927	71936	71937	71937	she	179	" It 's my native land , this , "
71940	71950	71937	71937	she	179	" I could smell my way about it blindfold . "
72103	72119	72120	72120	she	179	" That 's Christopher , come in already , and gone to feed his chickens , "
72455	72465	72467	72470	the Reverend Wyndham Datchet	296	" You came by the 3.10 , Mr. Denham ? "
72495	72551	72467	72470	the Reverend Wyndham Datchet	296	" They treat us very well , on the whole . Considering the increase of traffic , they treat us very well indeed . I have the curiosity sometimes to count the trucks on the goods ' trains , and they 're well over fifty well over fifty , at this season of the year . "
72741	72749	72750	72750	Elizabeth	288	" It 's not the kitchen really , "
72758	72764	72750	72750	Elizabeth	288	" but we call it so "
72765	72775	72777	72777	Edward	290	" It 's the nicest room in the house , "
72779	72800	72802	72802	Elizabeth	288	" It 's got the old rests by the side of the fireplace , where the men hung their guns , "
72821	72874	72802	72802	Elizabeth	288	" Show Mr. Denham the steps , Christopher .... When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were here two years ago they said this was the most interesting part of the house . These narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred years old five hundred years , I think they may have said six . "
73116	73128	73130	73130	Christopher	204	" Will you come out shooting with us to - morrow ? "
73149	73162	73164	73164	Ralph	158	" I wo n't shoot , but I 'll come with you , "
73166	73174	73176	73176	Edward	290	" Do n't you care about shooting ? "
73187	73196	73198	73198	Ralph	158	" I 've never shot in my life , "
73220	73233	73235	73235	Christopher	204	" You would n't have much chance in London , I suppose , "
73237	73250	73235	73235	Christopher	204	" But wo n't you find it rather dull just watching us ? "
73251	73257	73258	73258	Ralph	158	" I shall watch birds , "
73265	73276	73278	73278	Edward	290	" I can show you the place for watching birds , "
73280	73340	73278	73278	Edward	290	" if that 's what you like doing . I know a fellow who comes down from London about this time every year to watch them . It 's a great place for the wild geese and the ducks . I 've heard this man say that it 's one of the best places for birds in the country . "
73341	73351	73352	73352	Ralph	158	" It 's about the best place in England , "
73552	73566	73568	73568	Christopher	204	" Piper ! oh , damn ! I shall have to get up , "
73570	73580	73581	73581	Edward	290	" It 's not Piper , it 's Pitch , "
73584	73596	73597	73597	Christopher	204	" All the same , I shall have to get up , "
73634	73643	73644	73644	Mary	179	" Do come in and shut the door ! "
73653	73664	73666	73666	Christopher	204	" We shall have a fine day to - morrow , "
73762	73774	73775	73775	Ralph	158	" I should like Mary to stroke my head like that , "
74666	74809	74651	74651	she	133	" To begin with , I 'm very fond of William . You ca n't deny that . I know him better than any one , almost . But why I 'm marrying him is , partly , I admit I 'm being quite honest with you , and you must n't tell any one partly because I want to get married . I want to have a house of my own . It is n't possible at home . It 's all very well for you , Henry ; you can go your own way . I have to be there always . Besides , you know what our house is . You would n't be happy either , if you did n't do something . It is n't that I have n't the time at home it 's the atmosphere . "
74838	74849	74830	74830	his	2038	" Well , but what do you want to do ? "
74870	74875	74876	74876	she	133	" I should like , "
74898	74908	74876	74876	she	133	" to study mathematics to know about the stars . "
74955	75077	74944	74944	Katharine	133	" I do n't care much whether I ever get to know anything but I want to work out something in figures something that has n't got to do with human beings . I do n't want people particularly . In some ways , Henry , I 'm a humbug I mean , I 'm not what you all take me for . I 'm not domestic , or very practical or sensible , really . And if I could calculate things , and use a telescope , and have to work out figures , and know to a fraction where I was wrong , I should be perfectly happy , and I believe I should give William all he wants . "
76170	76179	76180	76180	he	376	" You have fled , too , then ? "
76201	76204	76205	76205	she	133	" Fled ? "
76208	76235	76205	76205	she	133	" From whom d'you mean ? Oh , the family party . Yes , it was hot down there , so I went into the garden . "
76236	76244	76245	76245	Henry	306	" And are n't you very cold ? "
76297	76303	76304	76304	she	133	" Thank you , Henry , "
76307	76314	76304	76304	she	133	" I 'm not disturbing you ? "
76315	76326	76327	76327	he	306	" I 'm not here . I 'm at Bungay , "
76330	76373	76304	76304	she	133	" I 'm giving a music lesson to Harold and Julia . That was why I had to leave the table with the ladies I 'm spending the night there , and I sha n't be back till late on Christmas Eve . "
76374	76378	76379	76379	Katharine	133	" How I wish "
76386	76396	76397	76397	she	133	" I think these parties are a great mistake , "
76404	76409	76410	76410	he	306	" Oh , horrible ! "
76643	76654	76656	76656	Henry	192	" Well , what 's the date of the wedding ? "
76664	76672	76673	76673	she	133	" I think some time in March , "
76676	76680	76681	76681	he	192	" And afterwards ? "
76684	76697	76656	76656	Henry	192	" We take a house , I suppose , somewhere in Chelsea . "
76698	76704	76705	76705	he	192	" It 's very interesting , "
76768	76777	76765	76765	Henry	192	" Perhaps marriage will make you more human . "
76804	76826	76827	76827	she	133	" When you consider things like the stars , our affairs do n't seem to matter very much , do they ? "
76831	76845	76846	76846	Henry	192	" I do n't think I ever do consider things like the stars , "
76849	76863	76864	76864	he	192	" I 'm not sure that that 's not the explanation , though , "
76872	76881	76882	76882	she	133	" I doubt whether there is an explanation , "
76894	76902	76903	76903	he	192	" What ? No explanation of anything ? "
76910	76921	76922	76922	she	133	" Oh , things happen . That 's about all , "
76932	76943	76947	76947	himself	192	" That certainly seems to explain some of your actions , "
76949	76967	76968	76968	he	192	" One thing 's about as good as another , and one 's got to do something , "
77005	77020	76998	76998	she	133	" Well , if you believe that your life must be simple , Henry . "
77021	77029	77030	77030	he	192	" But I do n't believe it , "
77034	77040	77041	77041	she	133	" No more do I , "
77044	77050	77051	77051	he	192	" What about the stars ? "
77057	77069	77051	77051	he	192	" I understand that you rule your life by the stars ? "
77104	77126	77127	77127	she	133	" But do you always understand why you do everything ? Ought one to understand ? People like my mother understand , "
77130	77148	77101	77101	she	133	" Now I must go down to them , I suppose , and see what 's happening . "
77149	77155	77156	77156	Henry	192	" What could be happening ? "
77159	77169	77170	77170	she	133	" Oh , they may want to settle something , "
77201	77208	77209	77209	she	133	" And then there 's William , "
77227	77239	77240	77240	she	133	" Do they know what coals are made of , Henry ? "
77247	77255	77256	77256	he	192	" Mares ' tails , I believe , "
77259	77270	77271	77271	she	133	" Have you ever been down a coal - mine ? "
77275	77288	77289	77289	he	192	" Do n't let 's talk about coal - mines , Katharine , "
77292	77306	77289	77289	he	192	" We shall probably never see each other again . When you 're married "
77321	77329	77330	77330	she	133	" Why do you all tease me ? "
77333	77339	77330	77330	she	133	" It is n't kind . "
77393	77401	77402	77402	she	133	" Things are n't easy , anyhow , "
77415	77434	77412	77412	Henry	192	" Promise me , Katharine , that if I can ever help you , you will let me . "
77458	77465	77466	77466	she	133	" Yes , I promise that , "
77547	77554	77555	77555	Rodney	180	" Well , here you are ! "
77585	77596	77597	77597	he	192	" That 's where you 've been all the time , "
77604	77614	77615	77615	she	133	" I 've only been here about ten minutes , "
77618	77634	77650	77650	Rodney	180	" My dear Katharine , you left the drawing - room over an hour ago . "
77639	77646	77647	77647	Henry	192	" Does it very much matter ? "
77670	77677	77678	77678	he	180	" They do n't like it , "
77681	77712	77678	77678	he	180	" It is n't kind to old people to leave them alone although I 've no doubt it 's much more amusing to sit up here and talk to Henry . "
77713	77721	77723	77724	Henry urbanely	192	" We were discussing coal - mines , "
77726	77741	77743	77743	Katharine	133	" Yes . But we were talking about much more interesting things before that , "
77774	77781	77783	77783	Rodney	180	" I can quite understand that , "
77823	77831	77832	77832	Katharine	133	" Was it very dull , William ? "
77850	77857	77858	77858	William	180	" Of course it was dull , "
77862	77878	77879	77879	she	133	" Well , you stay and talk to Henry , and I 'll go down , "
77939	77947	77949	77949	William	180	" I shall come down with you , "
77966	77970	77971	77971	she	133	" Oh no , "
77975	77984	77971	77971	she	133	" You stay here and talk to Henry . "
77985	77990	77992	77992	Henry	192	" Yes , do , "
78031	78041	78028	78028	he	180	" No . I want to come with you . "
78064	78085	78061	78061	her	133	" It 's useless for you to come . I shall go to bed in ten minutes . Good night . "
78196	78204	78206	78206	he	180	" The situation is becoming most uncomfortable . "
78424	78435	78436	78436	he	180	" You 've several big estates round here , Otway , "
78439	78460	78436	78436	he	180	" Any good hunting ? Let me see , what pack would it be ? Who 's your great man ? "
78461	78485	78436	78436	he	180	" Sir William Budge , the sugar king , has the biggest estate . He bought out poor Stanham , who went bankrupt . "
78486	78497	78436	78436	he	180	" Which Stanham would that be ? Verney or Alfred ? "
78498	78528	78529	78529	he	2100	" Alfred .... I do n't hunt myself . You 're a great huntsman , are n't you ? You have a great reputation as a horseman , anyhow , "
78544	78551	78552	78552	Rodney	180	" Oh , I love riding , "
78555	78592	78552	78552	Rodney	180	" Could I get a horse down here ? Stupid of me ! I forgot to bring any clothes . I ca n't imagine , though , who told you I was anything of a rider ? "
78679	78688	78689	78689	Rodney	180	" I do n't care much for shooting , "
78692	78755	78689	78689	Rodney	180	" but one has to do it , unless one wants to be altogether out of things . I dare say there 's some very pretty country round here . I stayed once at Bolham Hall . Young Cranthorpe was up with you , was n't he ? He married old Lord Bolham 's daughter . Very nice people in their way . "
78756	78765	78766	78766	Henry	192	" I do n't mix in that society , "
78826	78833	78834	78834	he	180	" Oh , but you should , "
78838	78864	78834	78834	he	180	" It 's well worth staying there , anyhow , once a year . They make one very comfortable , and the women are ravishing . "
78865	78869	78870	78870	Henry	192	" The women ? "
78878	78887	78870	78870	Henry	192	" What could any woman see in you ? "
78969	78982	78983	78983	he	192	" I do n't think I should get on in that society , "
78986	79005	78983	78983	he	192	" I do n't think I should know what to say to Lady Rose if I met her . "
79006	79014	79015	79015	Rodney	180	" I do n't find any difficulty , "
79018	79084	79015	79015	Rodney	180	" You talk to them about their children , if they have any , or their accomplishments painting , gardening , poetry they 're so delightfully sympathetic . Seriously , you know I think a woman 's opinion of one 's poetry is always worth having . Do n't ask them for their reasons . Just ask them for their feelings . Katharine , for example "
79085	79088	79090	79090	Henry	192	" Katharine , "
79110	79118	79102	79102	he	192	" Katharine is very unlike most women . "
79119	79122	79123	79123	Rodney	180	" Quite , "
79126	79129	79123	79123	Rodney	180	" She is "
79145	79152	79153	79153	he	180	" She 's looking very well , "
79179	79194	79176	79176	his	192	" But , as a family , you 're given to moods , eh ? "
79195	79199	79201	79201	Henry	192	" Not Katharine , "
79206	79210	79211	79211	Rodney	180	" Not Katharine , "
79224	79241	79242	79242	he	180	" No , perhaps you 're right . But her engagement has changed her . Naturally , "
79245	79254	79242	79242	he	180	" one would expect that to be so . "
79269	79281	79282	79282	he	180	" Katharine has had a difficult life , in some ways , "
79285	79301	79282	79282	he	180	" I expect that marriage will be good for her . She has great powers . "
79302	79305	79307	79307	Henry	192	" Great , "
79312	79323	79282	79282	he	180	" Yes but now what direction d'you think they take ? "
79350	79356	79357	79357	Henry	192	" I do n't know , "
79361	79386	79357	79357	Henry	192	" D'you think children a household that sort of thing d'you think that 'll satisfy her ? Mind , I 'm out all day . "
79387	79395	79396	79396	Henry	192	" She would certainly be very competent , "
79399	79407	79409	79409	Rodney	180	" Oh , she 's wonderfully competent , "
79411	79445	79409	79409	Rodney	180	" But I get absorbed in my poetry . Well , Katharine has n't got that . She admires my poetry , you know , but that would n't be enough for her ? "
79446	79449	79451	79451	Henry	192	" No , "
79456	79463	79464	79464	he	180	" I think you 're right , "
79476	79495	79464	79464	he	180	" Katharine has n't found herself yet . Life is n't altogether real to her yet I sometimes think "
79496	79499	79500	79500	Rodney	180	" Yes ? "
79513	79518	79519	79519	he	180	" That is what I "
80755	80777	80778	80778	she	133	" I wish you could help her to take an interest in something that other people are interested in , Katharine , "
80788	80827	80778	80778	she	133	" It 's all Henry 's doing , you know , giving up her parties and taking to these nasty insects . It does n't follow that if a man can do a thing a woman may too . "
81008	81015	81017	81018	Lady Otway	292	" It 's so very pleasant , "
81020	81041	81017	81018	Lady Otway	292	" to knit while one 's talking . And now , my dear Katharine , tell me about your plans . "
81168	81181	81182	81182	she	292	" What a perfect daughter , or daughter - in - law ! "
81204	81207	81208	81208	she	292	" Yes , "
81229	81248	81208	81208	she	292	" Katharine is like the girls of my youth . We took the serious things of life seriously . "
81314	81325	81326	81326	she	134	" I never SHALL know my way about this house ! "
81329	81356	81326	81326	she	134	" I 'm on my way to the library , and I do n't want to interrupt . You and Katharine were having a little chat ? "
81406	81418	81419	81419	she	292	" I was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage , "
81427	81439	81419	81419	she	292	" Are none of my children looking after you , Maggie ? "
81440	81443	81445	81446	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Marriage , "
81461	81490	81491	81491	she	134	" I always say marriage is a school . And you do n't get the prizes unless you go to school . Charlotte has won all the prizes , "
81526	81545	81547	81547	Katharine	133	" Aunt Charlotte was saying that it 's no good being married unless you submit to your husband , "
81592	81614	81615	81615	she	134	" Well , I really do n't advise a woman who wants to have things her own way to get married , "
81662	81669	81670	81670	she	134	" What a shame it was ! "
81687	81748	81749	81749	she	134	" But , Charlotte , it would have been much worse if Frank had disgraced himself in any way . And it is n't what our husbands GET , but what they ARE . I used to dream of white horses and palanquins , too ; but still , I like the ink - pots best . And who knows ? "
81756	81768	81749	81749	she	134	" your father may be made a baronet to - morrow . "
81792	81797	81830	81830	she	134	" that old Turk , "
81818	81829	81830	81830	she	134	" But if you can give way to your husband , "
81847	81859	81830	81830	she	134	" a happy marriage is the happiest thing in the world . "
81860	81863	81865	81865	Katharine	133	" Yes , "
81867	81869	81865	81865	Katharine	133	" but "
82147	82155	82156	82156	she	134	" We 've all had perfect husbands , "
82170	82194	82195	82195	she	134	" Not that I think a bad temper is really a fault in a man . I do n't mean a bad temper , "
82210	82237	82195	82195	she	134	" I should say a quick , impatient temper . Most , in fact ALL great men have had bad tempers except your grandfather , Katharine , "
82258	82276	82278	82278	Katharine	133	" But in the ordinary marriage , is it necessary to give way to one 's husband ? "
82310	82318	82320	82321	Lady Otway	292	" I should say yes , certainly , "
82331	82348	82349	82349	Katharine	133	" Then one ought to make up one 's mind to that before one is married , "
82394	82404	82405	82405	she	134	" Do look at that lovely little blue bird ! "
82455	82469	82484	82484	she	292	" Most women know by instinct whether they can give it or not , "
82502	82517	82484	82484	she	292	" And if not well then , my advice would be do n't marry . "
82518	82531	82542	82542	she	134	" Oh , but marriage is the happiest life for a woman , "
82563	82571	82572	82572	she	134	" It 's the most INTERESTING life , "
82918	82929	82931	82932	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Why do n't we all live in the country ? "
82942	83030	82931	82932	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I 'm sure one would think such beautiful things if one lived in the country . No horrid slum houses to depress one , no trams or motor - cars ; and the people all looking so plump and cheerful . Is n't there some little cottage near you , Charlotte , which would do for us , with a spare room , perhaps , in case we asked a friend down ? And we should save so much money that we should be able to travel "
83031	83049	83051	83052	Lady Otway	292	" Yes . You would find it very nice for a week or two , no doubt , "
83054	83066	83067	83067	she	292	" But what hour would you like the carriage this morning ? "
83074	83079	83081	83082	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Katharine shall decide , "
83094	83198	83081	83082	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" And I was just going to tell you , Katharine , how , when I woke this morning , everything seemed so clear in my head that if I 'd had a pencil I believe I could have written quite a long chapter . When we 're out on our drive I shall find us a house . A few trees round it , and a little garden , a pond with a Chinese duck , a study for your father , a study for me , and a sitting room for Katharine , because then she 'll be a married lady . "
83257	83270	83271	83271	she	133	" Let me look at your engagement - ring , Aunt Charlotte , "
83302	83319	83320	83321	Lady Otway	292	" That poor old ring was a sad disappointment to me when I first had it , "
83324	83351	83320	83321	Lady Otway	292	" I 'd set my heart on a diamond ring , but I never liked to tell Frank , naturally . He bought it at Simla . "
83756	83765	83767	83768	Lady Otway	292	" Why did n't Andrews tell me himself ? "
83870	83872	83860	83860	himself	305	" Times "
84276	84279	84273	84273	she	133	" Hum ! "
84805	84836	84796	84796	herself	179	" I love you ; I shall never love anybody else . Marry me or leave me ; think what you like of me I do n't care a straw . "
84898	84903	84906	84906	she	179	" I love you , "
84909	84917	84906	84906	she	179	" I love the beech - trees , "
84920	84926	84906	84906	she	179	" I love I love . "
84927	84934	84935	84935	Ralph	158	" Do you know , Mary , "
84940	84948	84935	84935	Ralph	158	" I 've made up my mind . "
84992	85038	85039	85039	He	158	" I 've made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here . I want you to tell me about that cottage you spoke of . However , I suppose there 'll be no difficulty about getting a cottage , will there ? "
85081	85091	85092	85092	he	158	" I ca n't stand the office any longer , "
85095	85120	85092	85092	he	158	" I do n't know what my family will say ; but I 'm sure I 'm right . Do n't you think so ? "
85121	85128	85129	85129	she	179	" Live down here by yourself ? "
85132	85144	85145	85145	he	158	" Some old woman would do for me , I suppose , "
85148	85157	85158	85158	he	158	" I 'm sick of the whole thing , "
85182	85243	85170	85170	They	2305	" I tell you , Mary , it 's utter destruction , working away , day after day , at stuff that does n't matter a damn to any one . I 've stood eight years of it , and I 'm not going to stand it any longer . I suppose this all seems to you mad , though ? "
85255	85265	85266	85266	she	179	" No . I thought you were n't happy , "
85269	85276	85277	85277	he	158	" Why did you think that ? "
85284	85297	85298	85298	she	179	" Do n't you remember that morning in Lincoln 's Inn Fields ? "
85301	85304	85306	85306	Ralph	158	" Yes , "
85346	85353	85354	85354	he	158	" You 're right , Mary , "
85363	85374	85354	85354	he	158	" though I do n't know how you guessed it . "
85399	85406	85407	85407	he	158	" I was unhappy very unhappy , "
85579	85587	85588	85588	he	158	" Unhappiness is a state of mind , "
85591	85608	85588	85588	he	158	" by which I mean that it is not necessarily the result of any particular cause . "
85643	85652	85653	85653	he	158	" I began to find my life unsatisfactory , "
85657	85664	85653	85653	he	158	" It seemed to me meaningless . "
85691	85819	85641	85641	Katharine	133	" All this money - making and working ten hours a day in an office , what 's it FOR ? When one 's a boy , you see , one 's head is so full of dreams that it does n't seem to matter what one does . And if you 're ambitious , you 're all right ; you 've got a reason for going on . Now my reasons ceased to satisfy me . Perhaps I never had any . That 's very likely now I come to think of it . What reason is there for anything , though ? Still , it 's impossible , after a certain age , to take oneself in satisfactorily . And I know what carried me on "
85828	85918	85641	85641	Katharine	133	" I wanted to be the savior of my family and all that kind of thing . I wanted them to get on in the world . That was a lie , of course a kind of self - glorification , too . Like most people , I suppose , I 've lived almost entirely among delusions , and now I 'm at the awkward stage of finding it out . I want another delusion to go on with . That 's what my unhappiness amounts to , Mary . "
85964	85978	85979	85979	she	179	" I do n't think it will be difficult to find a cottage , "
85993	86007	86008	86008	she	179	" You 've got a little money , have n't you ? Yes , "
86011	86026	86008	86008	she	179	" I do n't see why it should n't be a very good plan . "
86153	86194	86195	86195	she	179	" Yes , Ralph , it 's time you made a break . I 've come to the same conclusion myself . Only it wo n't be a country cottage in my case ; it 'll be America . America ! "
86198	86230	86195	86195	she	179	" That 's the place for me ! They 'll teach me something about organizing a movement there , and I 'll come back and show you how to do it . "
86338	86346	86347	86347	he	158	" Do n't go away , Mary ! "
86353	86363	86364	86364	she	179	" That 's what you said before , Ralph , "
86372	86398	86364	86364	she	179	" You want to go away yourself and you do n't want me to go away . That 's not very sensible , is it ? "
86399	86402	86403	86403	he	158	" Mary , "
86419	86429	86403	86403	he	158	" what a brute I 've been to you ! "
86747	86752	86753	86753	he	158	" Katharine , Katharine , "
86809	86814	86815	86815	he	158	" Katharine , Katharine , "
86984	86996	86975	86975	he	158	" Now , Mary , what 's all this about America ? "
87240	87249	87250	87250	she	179	" You must see that there 's water , "
87300	87306	87307	87307	he	158	" One of the rooms , "
87310	87331	87307	87307	he	158	" must be my study , for , you see , Mary , I 'm going to write a book . "
87366	87376	87377	87377	she	179	" And what 's your book to be about ? "
88199	88204	88181	88181	he	158	" Well , Mary ? "
88233	88238	88225	88225	he	158	" Well , Mary ? "
88545	88550	88532	88532	he	158	" Well , Mary ? "
88668	88683	88655	88655	she	179	" There , there . Do n't cry ! Tell me why you 're crying "
88725	88732	88733	88733	he	158	" How damnable this all is ! "
88737	88744	88745	88745	she	179	" What are you talking about ? "
88785	88788	88789	88789	he	158	" Mary , "
88792	88815	88789	88789	he	158	" I want to talk to you . Have n't we nearly done ? Why do n't they take away these plates ? "
88842	88851	88852	88852	she	179	" They 'll come all in good time , "
88881	88887	88888	88888	Ralph	158	" I want to apologize , "
88924	88988	88888	88888	Ralph	158	" I think I 've treated you very badly . That is , I 've told you lies . Did you guess that I was lying to you ? Once in Lincoln 's Inn Fields and again to - day on our walk . I am a liar , Mary . Did you know that ? Do you think you do know me ? "
88989	88995	88996	88996	she	2397	" I think I do , "
89008	89022	89023	89023	he	2398	" It 's true I do n't want you to go to America , "
89034	89050	89051	89051	he	2398	" In fact , my feelings towards you seem to be utterly and damnably bad , "
89063	89123	89131	89131	he	2398	" If I were n't a selfish beast I should tell you to have nothing more to do with me . And yet , Mary , in spite of the fact that I believe what I 'm saying , I also believe that it 's good we should know each other the world being what it is , you see "
89140	89177	89131	89131	he	2398	" for , of course , in an ideal state of things , in a decent community even , there 's no doubt you should n't have anything to do with me seriously , that is . "
89178	89191	89193	89193	Mary	179	" You forget that I 'm not an ideal character , either , "
89249	89291	89293	89293	she	179	" I 'm much more selfish than I let on , and I 'm worldly a little more than you think , anyhow . I like bossing things perhaps that 's my greatest fault . I 've none of your passion for "
89310	89315	89316	89316	she	179	" for the truth , "
89329	89339	89340	89340	Ralph	158	" I 've told you I 'm a liar , "
89344	89355	89356	89356	she	179	" Oh , in little things , I dare say , "
89360	89392	89356	89356	she	179	" But not in real ones , and that 's what matters . I dare say I 'm more truthful than you are in small ways . But I could never care "
89412	89443	89444	89444	Her	179	" for any one who was a liar in that way . I love the truth a certain amount a considerable amount but not in the way you love it . "
89463	89467	89468	89468	Ralph	158	" Good heavens ! "
89473	89500	89471	89471	himself	158	" She loves me ! Why did I never see it before ? She 's going to cry ; no , but she ca n't speak . "
90032	90038	90012	90012	He	158	" That was Katharine Hilbery . "
90039	90048	90049	90049	she	179	" Katharine Hilbery ? What do you mean ? "
90065	90069	90070	90070	he	158	" Katharine Hilbery , "
90073	90080	90070	90070	he	158	" But she 's gone now . "
90081	90085	90086	90086	Mary	179	" Katharine Hilbery ! "
90096	90106	90086	90086	Mary	179	" I 've always known it was Katharine Hilbery ! "
90552	90600	90603	90604	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I 'm not mistaken ? Surely Mr. Denham ? I caught a glimpse of your coat through the window , and I felt sure that I knew your coat . Have you seen Katharine or William ? I 'm wandering about Lincoln looking for the ruins . "
90621	90632	90633	90633	she	134	" First of all , tell me where I am , "
90650	90735	90645	90645	she	134	" The ruins my party is waiting for me at the ruins . The Roman ruins or Greek , Mr. Denham ? Your town has a great many beautiful things in it , but I wish it had n't so many ruins . I never saw such delightful little pots of honey in my life are they made by your own bees ? Please give me one of those little pots , and tell me how I shall find my way to the ruins . "
90736	90740	90741	90741	she	2425	" And now , "
90825	90828	90829	90829	she	2425	" Now , "
90832	90854	90855	90855	she	2425	" please tell me what you 're doing here , Mr. Denham for you ARE Mr. Denham , are n't you ? "
90870	90934	90855	90855	she	2425	" The brilliant young man who writes for the Review , I mean ? Only yesterday my husband was telling me he thought you one of the cleverest young men he knew . Certainly , you 've been the messenger of Providence to me , for unless I 'd seen you I 'm sure I should never have found the ruins at all . "
90979	90989	90990	90990	she	134	" I 've found something much better than ruins ! "
90993	91035	90990	90990	she	134	" I 've found two friends who told me how to find you , which I could never have done without them . They must come and have tea with us . What a pity that we 've just had luncheon . "
91156	91184	91185	91185	she	133	" I never knew you lived here . Why did n't you say so , and we could have met ? And are you staying with Mary ? "
91192	91202	91185	91185	she	133	" What a pity we did n't meet before . "
91472	91477	91479	91479	Katharine	133	" Do you know , "
91491	91525	91479	91479	Katharine	133	" I thought I saw you this morning , standing at a window . But I decided that it could n't be you . And it must have been you all the same . "
91526	91540	91541	91541	he	158	" Yes , I thought I saw you but it was n't you , "
91622	91629	91630	91630	she	133	" I expect it was me , "
91633	91731	91630	91630	she	133	" I was looking for my mother . It happens every time we come to Lincoln . In fact , there never was a family so unable to take care of itself as ours is . Not that it very much matters , because some one always turns up in the nick of time to help us out of our scrapes . Once I was left in a field with a bull when I was a baby but where did we leave the carriage ? Down that street or the next ? The next , I think . "
91757	91765	91766	91766	she	133	" But what are you doing here ? "
91769	91803	91738	91739	the others	4805	" I 'm buying a cottage . I 'm going to live here as soon as I can find a cottage , and Mary tells me there 'll be no difficulty about that . "
91804	91807	91808	91808	she	133	" But , "
91818	91828	91808	91808	she	133	" you will give up the Bar , then ? "
91843	91857	91808	91808	she	133	" The solicitor 's office ? Yes . I 'm giving that up . "
91858	91862	91863	91863	she	133	" But why ? "
91885	91903	91866	91866	She	133	" I think you 're very wise to give it up . You will be much happier . "
91967	91978	91979	91979	he	52	" I do n't know what one means by happiness , "
91997	92046	91979	91979	he	52	" Why do you think I shall be happy ? I do n't expect to be anything of the kind . I expect to be rather less unhappy . I shall write a book and curse my charwoman if happiness consists in that . What do you think ? "
92086	92115	92075	92075	Rodney	180	" Henry is going to drive home with your mother , and I suggest that they should put us down half - way and let us walk back . "
92131	92148	92149	92149	he	180	" Unfortunately we go in opposite directions , or we might have given you a lift , "
92208	92228	92229	92229	She	133	" I want to see you . Are you going back to London at once ? I will write . "
92765	92775	92776	92776	he	180	" There 's no need for us to race , "
92820	92828	92799	92799	he	180	" I 've not enjoyed my holiday . "
92829	92832	92799	92799	he	180	" No ? "
92833	92847	92799	92799	he	180	" No . I shall be glad to get back to work again . "
92848	92861	92862	92862	she	133	" Saturday , Sunday , Monday there are only three days more , "
92865	92878	92879	92879	he	180	" No one enjoys being made a fool of before other people , "
92908	92917	92918	92918	she	133	" That refers to me , I suppose , "
92922	92940	92941	92941	he	180	" Every day since we 've been here you 've done something to make me appear ridiculous , "
92945	93065	92941	92941	he	180	" Of course , so long as it amuses you , you 're welcome ; but we have to remember that we are going to spend our lives together . I asked you , only this morning , for example , to come out and take a turn with me in the garden . I was waiting for you ten minutes , and you never came . Every one saw me waiting . The stable - boys saw me . I was so ashamed that I went in . Then , on the drive you hardly spoke to me . Henry noticed it . Every one notices it .... You find no difficulty in talking to Henry , though . "
93100	93111	93112	93112	she	2490	" None of these things seem to me to matter , "
93115	93129	93130	93130	he	2491	" Very well , then . I may as well hold my tongue , "
93133	93155	93156	93156	she	2490	" In themselves they do n't seem to me to matter ; if they hurt you , of course they matter , "
93178	93188	93189	93189	he	2491	" And we might be so happy , Katharine ! "
93205	93221	93222	93222	she	2490	" As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy , "
93370	93378	93379	93379	he	180	" What do I feel about Katharine ? "
93504	93531	93532	93532	he	180	" If she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh at me I could n't have felt that about her , "
93535	93573	93574	93574	he	180	" I 'm not a fool , after all . I ca n't have been utterly mistaken all these years . And yet , when she speaks to me like that ! The truth of it is , "
93577	93630	93574	93574	he	180	" that I 've got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me like that . Katharine is quite right . And yet those are not my serious feelings , as she knows quite well . How can I change myself ? What would make her care for me ? "
93893	93915	93874	93874	he	180	" If you have no feeling for me , would n't it be kinder to say so to me in private ? "
93916	93921	93922	93922	she	133	" Oh , William , "
93937	93969	93922	93922	she	133	" how you go on about feelings ! Is n't it better not to talk so much , not to be worrying always about small things that do n't really matter ? "
93970	93977	93978	93978	he	180	" That 's the question precisely , "
93981	94030	93978	93978	he	180	" I only want you to tell me that they do n't matter . There are times when you seem indifferent to everything . I 'm vain , I 've a thousand faults ; but you know they 're not everything ; you know I care for you . "
94031	94048	93922	93922	she	133	" And if I say that I care for you , do n't you believe me ? "
94049	94072	93978	93978	he	180	" Say it , Katharine ! Say it as if you meant it ! Make me feel that you care for me ! "
94427	94450	94415	94415	she	2504	" I was wrong to get engaged to you . I shall never make you happy . I have never loved you . "
94451	94454	94455	94455	he	2506	" Katharine ! "
94458	94463	94464	94464	she	2504	" No , never , "
94468	94486	94464	94464	she	2504	" Not rightly . Do n't you see , I did n't know what I was doing ? "
94487	94494	94495	94495	he	2506	" You love some one else ? "
94500	94505	94464	94464	she	2504	" Absolutely no one . "
94506	94509	94510	94510	he	2506	" Henry ? "
94513	94525	94464	94464	she	2504	" Henry ? I should have thought , William , even you "
94526	94532	94533	94533	he	2506	" There is some one , "
94536	94559	94533	94533	he	2506	" There has been a change in the last few weeks . You owe it to me to be honest , Katharine . "
94560	94568	94569	94569	she	2504	" If I could , I would , "
94572	94585	94586	94586	he	2506	" Why did you tell me you would marry me , then ? "
94676	94691	94692	94692	Rodney	180	" But you 're not a child you 're not a woman of moods , "
94695	94709	94710	94710	he	2506	" You could n't have accepted me if you had n't loved me ! "
94882	94896	94897	94897	she	2504	" I did say I would marry you , but it was wrong , "
94923	94972	94904	94904	she	2504	" for I do n't love you , William ; you 've noticed it , every one 's noticed it ; why should we go on pretending ? When I told you I loved you , I was wrong . I said what I knew to be untrue . "
95272	95283	95284	95284	he	2513	" When did you begin to feel this , Katharine ? "
95287	95382	95284	95284	he	2513	" for it is n't true to say that you 've always felt it . I admit I was unreasonable the first night when you found that your clothes had been left behind . Still , where 's the fault in that ? I could promise you never to interfere with your clothes again . I admit I was cross when I found you upstairs with Henry . Perhaps I showed it too openly . But that 's not unreasonable either when one 's engaged . Ask your mother . And now this terrible thing "
95396	95422	95383	95383	He	2513	" This decision you say you 've come to have you discussed it with any one ? Your mother , for example , or Henry ? "
95423	95432	95433	95433	she	2517	" No , no , of course not , "
95443	95452	95433	95433	she	2517	" But you do n't understand me , William "
95453	95459	95440	95440	her	2517	" Help me to understand you "
95460	95506	95507	95507	she	2517	" You do n't understand , I mean , my real feelings ; how could you ? I 've only now faced them myself . But I have n't got the sort of feeling love , I mean I do n't know what to call it "
95516	95529	95440	95440	her	2517	" but , anyhow , without it our marriage would be a farce "
95530	95535	95536	95536	he	2518	" How a farce ? "
95539	95548	95549	95549	he	2518	" But this kind of analysis is disastrous ! "
95552	95560	95561	95561	she	2517	" I should have done it before , "
95565	95576	95577	95577	he	2518	" You make yourself think things you do n't think , "
95591	95748	95749	95749	he	2519	" Believe me , Katharine , before we came here we were perfectly happy . You were full of plans for our house the chair - covers , do n't you remember ? like any other woman who is about to be married . Now , for no reason whatever , you begin to fret about your feeling and about my feeling , with the usual result . I assure you , Katharine , I 've been through it all myself . At one time I was always asking myself absurd questions which came to nothing either . What you want , if I may say so , is some occupation to take you out of yourself when this morbid mood comes on . If it had n't been for my poetry , I assure you , I should often have been very much in the same state myself . To let you into a secret , "
95763	95826	95753	95753	his	2519	" I 've often gone home from seeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force myself to write a page or two before I could get you out of my head . Ask Denham ; he 'll tell you how he met me one night ; he 'll tell you what a state he found me in . "
96169	96181	96182	96182	he	180	" She will make a perfect mother a mother of sons , "
96205	96212	96213	96213	he	180	" A farce , a farce , "
96218	96229	96213	96213	he	180	" She said that our marriage would be a farce , "
96571	96574	96575	96575	she	133	" William , "
96578	96592	96575	96575	she	133	" I will marry you . I will try to make you happy . "
96940	97009	97010	97010	He	158	" What I was going to say when we were interrupted at lunch was that if you go to America I shall come , too . It ca n't be harder to earn a living there than it is here . However , that 's not the point . The point is , Mary , that I want to marry you . Well , what do you say ? "
97026	97040	97041	97041	he	158	" You know me by this time , the good and the bad , "
97045	97070	97041	97041	he	158	" You know my tempers . I 've tried to let you know my faults . Well , what do you say , Mary ? "
97084	97150	97152	97152	he	158	" In most ways , at least in the important ways , as you said , we know each other and we think alike . I believe you are the only person in the world I could live with happily . And if you feel the same about me as you do , do n't you , Mary ? we should make each other happy . "
97178	97191	97192	97192	Mary	179	" Yes , but I 'm afraid I could n't do it , "
97246	97253	97254	97254	he	158	" You could n't do it ? "
97257	97266	97267	97267	she	179	" No , I could n't marry you , "
97270	97278	97279	97279	She	179	" You do n't care for me ? "
97284	97289	97290	97290	he	158	" Well , Mary , "
97298	97312	97290	97290	he	158	" I must be an arrant fool , for I thought you did . "
97337	97354	97325	97325	he	158	" I do n't believe you , Mary . You 're not telling me the truth . "
97355	97365	97366	97366	she	179	" I 'm too tired to argue , Ralph , "
97376	97400	97370	97370	her	179	" I ask you to believe what I say . I ca n't marry you ; I do n't want to marry you . "
97595	97678	97710	97710	she	179	" Have n't I always been thinking of Katharine while I was with Mary ? I might have loved Mary if it had n't been for that idiocy of mine . She cared for me once , I 'm certain of that , but I tormented her so with my humors that I let my chances slip , and now she wo n't risk marrying me . And this is what I 've made of my life nothing , nothing , nothing . "
97895	97905	97906	97906	Ralph	158	" If you do n't want to marry me , "

97976	97990	97973	97973	he	158	" have I done anything to make you change your mind about me ? "
98234	98240	98241	98241	he	158	" You need n't answer , "
98245	98271	98241	98241	he	158	" There are reasons enough , I know . But must they kill our friendship , Mary ? Let me keep that , at least . "
98272	98275	98276	98276	she	179	" Oh , "
98296	98312	98276	98276	she	179	" it has come to this to this when I could have given him everything ! "
98313	98322	98323	98323	she	179	" Yes , we can still be friends , "
98333	98340	98341	98341	he	158	" I shall want your friendship , "
98347	98375	98344	98344	He	158	" If you find it possible , let me see you as often as you can . The oftener the better . I shall want your help . "
98612	98627	98628	98628	she	179	" You asked me if I had changed my mind about you , Ralph , "
98631	98673	98628	98628	she	179	" I think there 's only one thing . When you asked me to marry you , I do n't think you meant it . That made me angry for the moment . Before , you 'd always spoken the truth . "
98719	98727	98728	98728	he	158	" I never said I loved you , "
98766	98779	98780	98780	she	179	" And to me marriage without love does n't seem worth while , "
98783	98796	98797	98797	he	158	" Well , Mary , I 'm not going to press you , "
98800	98958	98797	98797	he	158	" I see you do n't want to marry me . But love do n't we all talk a great deal of nonsense about it ? What does one mean ? I believe I care for you more genuinely than nine men out of ten care for the women they 're in love with . It 's only a story one makes up in one 's mind about another person , and one knows all the time it is n't true . Of course one knows ; why , one 's always taking care not to destroy the illusion . One takes care not to see them too often , or to be alone with them for too long together . It 's a pleasant illusion , but if you 're thinking of the risks of marriage , it seems to me that the risk of marrying a person you 're in love with is something colossal . "
98959	98979	98980	98980	she	2558	" I do n't believe a word of that , and what 's more you do n't , either , "
98985	99000	99001	99001	She	2558	" However , we do n't agree ; I only wanted you to understand . "
99216	99227	99228	99228	he	158	" I doubt that one human being ever understands another , "
99246	99304	99305	99305	he	158	" Such damned liars as we all are , how can we ? But we can try . If you do n't want to marry me , do n't ; but the position you take up about love , and not seeing each other is n't that mere sentimentality ? You think I 've behaved very badly , "
99314	99366	99305	99305	he	158	" Of course I behave badly ; but you ca n't judge people by what they do . You ca n't go through life measuring right and wrong with a foot - rule . That 's what you 're always doing , Mary ; that 's what you 're doing now . "
99406	99414	99415	99415	she	179	" I 'm not angry with you , "
99419	99433	99415	99415	she	179	" I will go on seeing you , as I said I would . "
99678	99686	99687	99687	she	179	" The simple elementary acts of justice , "
99715	99758	99759	99759	she	179	" are as far beyond them as they ever were . We can only look upon ourselves , Mary , as pioneers in a wilderness . We can only go on patiently putting the truth before them . It is n't THEM , "
99771	99831	99759	99759	she	179	" it 's their leaders . It 's those gentlemen sitting in Parliament and drawing four hundred a year of the people 's money . If we had to put our case to the people , we should soon have justice done to us . I have always believed in the people , and I do so still . But "

We must have our fingers upon the pulse of the community ; we want to know what people all over England are thinking ; we want to put them in the way of thinking rightly . "

My father , in his generation , a pioneer I , coming after him , do my little best . What , alas ! can one do more ? And now it 's you young women we look to you the future looks to you . Ah , my dear , if I 'd a thousand lives , I 'd give them all to our cause . The cause of women , d'you say ? I say the cause of humanity . And there are some "
103259	103312	103313	103313	she	2645	" who do n't see it ! There are some who are satisfied to go on , year after year , refusing to admit the truth . And we who have the vision the kettle boiling over ? No , no , let me see to it we who know the truth , "

103608	103634	103635	103635	he	199	" Reality has to be voiced by reason before it can make itself felt . The weak point of all these movements , Miss Datchet , "
103659	103701	103702	103702	he	199	" is that they are not based upon sufficiently intellectual grounds . A mistake , in my opinion . The British public likes a pellet of reason in its jam of eloquence a pill of reason in its pudding of sentiment , "

108428	108453	108425	108425	She	179	" I have n't any authority from Ralph to say it ; but I 'm sure of this he 's in love with you . "

108731	108875	108721	108721	her	133	" If I tell you , then we can talk ; and when I 'm jealous , I can tell you . And if I 'm tempted to do something frightfully mean , I can tell you ; you could make me tell you . I find talking so difficult ; but loneliness frightens me . I should shut it up in my mind . Yes , that 's what I 'm afraid of . Going about with something in my mind all my life that never changes . I find it so difficult to change . When I think a thing 's wrong I never stop thinking it wrong , and Ralph was quite right , I see , when he said that there 's no such thing as right and wrong ; no such thing , I mean , as judging people "

111210	111219	111220	111220	Katharine	133	" She 's at home , I think , "
111223	111232	111234	111234	William	180	" They keep her too much at home , "
111236	111285	111234	111234	William	180	" Why do n't you ask her to stay with you , and let her hear a little good music ? I 'll just finish what I was saying , if you do n't mind , because I 'm particularly anxious that she should hear to - morrow . "
111309	111321	111294	111294	Rodney	180	" Style , you know , is what we tend to neglect "
112038	112045	112046	112046	she	133	" Have you finished your letter ? "
112066	112081	112082	112082	he	180	" No , I 'm not going to write any more to - night , "
112085	112108	112082	112082	he	180	" I 'm not in the mood for it for some reason . I ca n't say what I want to say . "
112109	112123	112124	112124	Katharine	133	" Cassandra wo n't know if it 's well written or badly written , "
112127	112148	112082	112082	he	180	" I 'm not so sure about that . I should say she has a good deal of literary feeling . "
112149	112152	112154	112154	Katharine	133	" Perhaps , "
112157	112183	112154	112154	Katharine	133	" You 've been neglecting my education lately , by the way . I wish you 'd read something . Let me choose a book . "
112330	112333	112334	112334	she	133	" Swift , "
112353	112360	112334	112334	she	133	" Let us have some Swift . "
112517	112530	112531	112531	he	180	" I think it 's a little odd , do n't you ? "
112541	112577	112531	112531	he	180	" Most people , I mean , would be seriously upset if their marriage was put off for six months or so . But we are n't ; now how do you account for that ? "
112596	112601	112602	112602	he	180	" I attribute it , "
112613	112760	112602	112602	he	180	" to the fact that neither of us is in the least romantic about the other . That may be partly , no doubt , because we 've known each other so long ; but I 'm inclined to think there 's more in it than that . There 's something temperamental . I think you 're a trifle cold , and I suspect I 'm a trifle self - absorbed . If that were so it goes a long way to explaining our odd lack of illusion about each other . I 'm not saying that the most satisfactory marriages are n't founded upon this sort of understanding . But certainly it struck me as odd this morning , when Wilson told me , how little upset I felt . By the way , you 're sure we have n't committed ourselves to that house ? "
112761	112789	112876	112876	William	180	" I 've kept the letters , and I 'll go through them to - morrow ; but I 'm certain we 're on the safe side . "
112790	112799	112800	112800	he	2766	" Thanks . As to the psychological problem , "
112814	112857	112800	112800	he	2766	" there 's no doubt , I think , that either of us is capable of feeling what , for reasons of simplicity , I call romance for a third person at least , I 've little doubt in my own case . "
113015	113021	113022	113022	she	2767	" What is this romance ? "
113025	113051	113052	113052	he	2766	" Ah , that 's the question . I 've never come across a definition that satisfied me , though there are some very good ones "
113061	113076	113077	113077	she	2767	" It 's not altogether knowing the other person , perhaps it 's ignorance , "
113080	113096	113133	113133	his	2766	" Some authorities say it 's a question of distance romance in literature , that is "
113097	113115	113116	113116	she	2767	" Possibly , in the case of art . But in the case of people it may be "
113119	113128	113129	113129	he	2766	" Have you no personal experience of it ? "
113143	113152	113153	113153	she	2767	" I believe it 's influenced me enormously , "
113173	113186	113187	113187	she	2767	" but in my life there 's so little scope for it , "
113280	113287	113288	113288	William	180	" But is n't it curious , "
113291	113306	113288	113288	William	180	" that you should neither feel it for me , nor I for you ? "
113402	113419	113420	113420	she	2767	" I think you might be very happy with some one you loved in that way , "
113423	113438	113420	113420	she	2767	" You assume that romance survives a closer knowledge of the person one loves ? "
113646	113659	113660	113660	she	133	" I do n't see why it should n't last with you , "
113663	113672	113673	113673	she	133	" I can imagine a certain sort of person "
113721	113725	113726	113726	she	133	" A person , "
113743	113789	113726	113726	she	133	" like Cassandra Otway , for instance . Cassandra is the most interesting of the Otways with the exception of Henry . Even so , I like Cassandra better . She has more than mere cleverness . She is a character a person by herself . "
113790	113795	113798	113798	William	180	" Those dreadful insects ! "
113827	113864	113824	113824	she	133	" You could insist that she confined herself to to something else .... But she cares for music ; I believe she writes poetry ; and there can be no doubt that she has a peculiar charm "
113886	113892	113882	113882	William	180	" I thought her affectionate ? "
113893	113917	113865	113865	She	133	" Extremely affectionate . She worships Henry . When you think what a house that is Uncle Francis always in one mood or another "
113918	113925	113926	113926	William	180	" Dear , dear , dear , "
113929	113938	113865	113865	She	133	" And you have so much in common . "
113939	113944	113945	113945	William	180	" My dear Katharine ! "
113966	113982	113949	113949	himself	180	" I really do n't know what we 're talking about .... I assure you .... "
114098	114111	114112	114112	she	133	" We 're talking about things that interest us both very much , "
114115	114157	114112	114112	she	133	" Sha n't we go on talking , and leave Swift for another time ? I do n't feel in the mood for Swift , and it 's a pity to read any one when that 's the case particularly Swift . "
114332	114356	114326	114326	He	180	" You 've stirred up all these odious and violent emotions , and now you must do the best you can with them . "
114414	114426	114427	114427	he	180	" I wish to do whatever you tell me to do , "
114430	114441	114427	114427	he	180	" I put myself entirely in your hands , Katharine . "
114442	114453	114454	114454	she	133	" You must try to tell me what you feel , "
114457	114491	114492	114492	He	180	" My dear , I feel a thousand things every second . I do n't know , I 'm sure , what I feel . That afternoon on the heath it was then then "
114506	114531	114532	114532	he	180	" Your ghastly good sense , as usual , has convinced me for the moment but what the truth is , Heaven only knows ! "
114535	114554	114555	114555	she	133	" Is n't it the truth that you are , or might be , in love with Cassandra ? "
114572	114581	114569	114569	he	180	" I believe you 're right , Katharine . "
114673	114680	114681	114681	he	180	" Katharine , I worship you , "
114689	114692	114693	114693	she	133	" Yes , "
114702	114710	114693	114693	she	133	" but you must open the door . "
115098	115112	115114	115114	Denham	158	" I 'd rather live here than anywhere in the whole of London , "
115116	115124	115129	115129	she	133	" And I 've got nowhere to live "
115133	115148	115149	115149	Rodney	180	" You could get rooms here , no doubt , if you wanted to , "
115152	115172	115183	115183	his	180	" But I 'm just leaving London for good I 've taken that cottage I was telling you about . "
115186	115210	115183	115183	his	180	" Indeed ? that 's sad .... You must give me your address . But you wo n't cut yourself off altogether , surely "
115211	115222	115223	115223	Denham	158	" You 'll be moving , too , I suppose , "
115240	115249	115234	115234	Katharine	133	" Where is the cottage you 've taken ? "
115550	115562	115563	115563	she	133	" But what will you find to do in the country ? "
115634	115641	115628	115628	he	180	" Yes , yes , yes . "
115752	115757	115744	115744	his	180	" Yes , yes , "
115926	115938	115916	115916	his	158	" I 'm going , too . Shall we go together ? "
116226	116241	116219	116219	Denham	158	" There seem to be no cabs . Shall we walk on a little ? "
116242	116246	116247	116247	she	133	" Very well , "
116695	116706	116707	116707	he	158	" Should you mind if we walked a little farther ? "
116710	116721	116707	116707	he	158	" There 's something I want to say to you . "
116722	116726	116727	116727	she	2814	" Very well , "
116742	116750	116751	116751	he	158	" It 's quieter by the river , "
116760	116769	116770	116770	he	158	" I want to ask you merely this , "
116824	116862	116863	116863	His	158	" I 've made you my standard ever since I saw you . I 've dreamt about you ; I 've thought of nothing but you ; you represent to me the only reality in the world . "
116900	116943	116944	116944	he	158	" And now things have come to such a pass that , unless I can speak to you openly , I believe I shall go mad . I think of you as the most beautiful , the truest thing in the world , "
116983	117026	117030	117030	him	158	" I see you everywhere , in the stars , in the river ; to me you 're everything that exists ; the reality of everything . Life , I tell you , would be impossible without you . And now I want "
117075	117081	117082	117082	she	2823	" I do n't understand , "
117085	117096	117082	117082	she	2823	" You 're saying things that you do n't mean . "
117097	117105	117106	117106	he	158	" I mean every word I say , "
117130	117139	117118	117118	She	2823	" Ralph Denham is in love with you . "
117158	117166	117167	117167	she	2823	" I saw Mary Datchet this afternoon , "
117189	117205	117176	117176	he	158	" She told you that I had asked her to marry me , I suppose ? "
117206	117209	117210	117210	Katharine	133	" No ! "
117216	117231	117232	117232	he	158	" I did though . It was the day I saw you at Lincoln , "
117235	117313	117232	117232	he	158	" I had meant to ask her to marry me , and then I looked out of the window and saw you . After that I did n't want to ask any one to marry me . But I did it ; and she knew I was lying , and refused me . I thought then , and still think , that she cares for me . I behaved very badly . I do n't defend myself . "
117314	117317	117319	117319	Katharine	133	" No , "
117321	117346	117347	117347	She	133	" I should hope not . There 's no defence that I can think of . If any conduct is wrong , that is . "
117363	117369	117370	117370	she	133	" It seems to me , "
117378	117395	117370	117370	she	133	" that people are bound to be honest . There 's no excuse for such behavior . "
117420	117442	117417	117417	he	2825	" I am not telling you that I am in love with you . I am not in love with you . "
117443	117450	117451	117451	she	133	" I did n't think that , "
117459	117474	117475	117475	he	2825	" I have not spoken a word to you that I do not mean , "
117478	117489	117490	117490	she	133	" Tell me then what it is that you mean , "
117522	117533	117534	117534	Ralph	158	" You say that we 've got to be honest , "
117537	117622	117623	117623	He	158	" Very well . I will try to tell you the facts ; but I warn you , you 'll think me mad . It 's a fact , though , that since I first saw you four or five months ago I have made you , in an utterly absurd way , I expect , my ideal . I 'm almost ashamed to tell you what lengths I 've gone to . It 's become the thing that matters most in my life . "
117627	117739	117625	117625	himself	158	" Without knowing you , except that you 're beautiful , and all that , I 've come to believe that we 're in some sort of agreement ; that we 're after something together ; that we see something .... I 've got into the habit of imagining you ; I 'm always thinking what you 'd say or do ; I walk along the street talking to you ; I dream of you . It 's merely a bad habit , a schoolboy habit , day - dreaming ; it 's a common experience ; half one 's friends do the same ; well , those are the facts . "
117749	117763	117764	117764	she	2829	" If you were to know me you would feel none of this , "
117767	117793	117794	117794	she	2829	" We do n't know each other we 've always been interrupted .... Were you going to tell me this that day my aunts came ? "
117807	117817	117818	117818	he	2830	" The day you told me of your engagement , "
117835	117850	117851	117851	he	2830	" I deny that I should cease to feel this if I knew you , "
117855	117892	117893	117893	he	2830	" I should feel it more reasonably that 's all . I should n't talk the kind of nonsense I 've talked to - night .... But it was n't nonsense . It was the truth , "
117897	117937	117938	117938	he	2830	" It 's the important thing . You can force me to talk as if this feeling for you were an hallucination , but all our feelings are that . The best of them are half illusions . Still , "
117947	117973	117938	117938	he	2830	" if it were n't as real a feeling as I 'm capable of , I should n't be changing my life on your account . "
117974	117980	117981	117981	she	2831	" What do you mean ? "
117984	118002	117938	117938	he	2830	" I told you . I 'm taking a cottage . I 'm giving up my profession . "
118003	118008	118009	118009	she	2831	" On my account ? "
118015	118022	118023	118023	he	2830	" Yes , on your account , "
118033	118044	118045	118045	she	2831	" But I do n't know you or your circumstances , "
118055	118068	118088	118088	her	2831	" You have no opinion about me one way or the other ? "
118069	118078	118079	118079	she	2831	" Yes , I suppose I have an opinion "
118108	118128	118098	118098	she	2831	" I thought that you criticized me perhaps disliked me . I thought of you as a person who judges "
118129	118139	118140	118140	he	2830	" No ; I 'm a person who feels , "
118148	118161	118162	118162	she	2831	" Tell me , then , what has made you do this ? "
118367	118388	118361	118361	She	2831	" Yes , I see .... But how would that help you ? ... Your brother has passed his examination ? "
118989	119004	119005	119005	he	158	" Then you will let me know your decision as soon as you can ? "
119036	119041	119042	119042	she	133	" I will write , "
119046	119049	119050	119050	she	133	" No , "
119077	119087	119050	119050	she	133	" I do n't see how to manage it . "
119128	119143	119144	119144	he	158	" There 's only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that I know of , "
119148	119153	119144	119144	he	158	" that 's Kew . "
119154	119157	119169	119169	He	158	" Kew ? "
119158	119161	119162	119162	he	158	" Kew , "
120398	120407	120390	120390	she	133	" D'you think he ever passed this house ? "
120425	120435	120436	120437	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" On his way to Blackfriars , I mean , "
120440	120455	120436	120437	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" for you know the latest discovery is that he owned a house there . "
120469	120509	120465	120466	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Which is a proof that he was n't as poor as they 've sometimes said . I should like to think that he had enough , though I do n't in the least want him to be rich . "
120526	120572	120573	120573	she	134	" My dear , I 'm not talking about YOUR William , though that 's another reason for liking him . I 'm talking , I 'm thinking , I 'm dreaming of MY William William Shakespeare , of course . Is n't it odd , "
120587	120688	120573	120573	she	134	" that for all one can see , that dear old thing in the blue bonnet , crossing the road with her basket on her arm , has never heard that there was such a person ? Yet it all goes on : lawyers hurrying to their work , cabmen squabbling for their fares , little boys rolling their hoops , little girls throwing bread to the gulls , as if there were n't a Shakespeare in the world . I should like to stand at that crossing all day long and say : ' People , read Shakespeare ! ' "
120820	120831	120832	120833	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Katharine ! I 've hit upon a brilliant idea ! "
120835	121007	121008	121008	she	2900	" to lay out , say , a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare , and give them to working men . Some of your clever friends who get up meetings might help us , Katharine . And that might lead to a playhouse , where we could all take parts . You 'd be Rosalind but you 've a dash of the old nurse in you . Your father 's Hamlet , come to years of discretion ; and I 'm well , I 'm a bit of them all ; I 'm quite a large bit of the fool , but the fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things . Now who shall William be ? A hero ? Hotspur ? Henry the Fifth ? No , William 's got a touch of Hamlet in him , too . I can fancy that William talks to himself when he 's alone . Ah , Katharine , you must say very beautiful things when you 're together ! "
121031	121041	121043	121043	Katharine	133	" Oh , we talk a lot of nonsense , "
121069	121083	121085	121086	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" It wo n't seem to you nonsense in ten years ' time , "
121088	121150	121151	121151	she	378	" Believe me , Katharine , you 'll look back on these days afterwards ; you 'll remember all the silly things you 've said ; and you 'll find that your life has been built on them . The best of life is built on what we say when we 're in love . It is n't nonsense , Katharine , "
121154	121166	121151	121151	she	378	" it 's the truth , it 's the only truth . "
121316	121320	121321	121321	Katharine	133	" Mary Datchet , "
121325	121392	121300	121300	she	134	" Ah I half wish I 'd called you Mary , but it would n't have gone with Hilbery , and it would n't have gone with Rodney . Now this is n't the passage I wanted . I never can find what I want . But it 's spring ; it 's the daffodils ; it 's the green fields ; it 's the birds . "
121414	121427	121428	121429	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" My dear child , how odious the triumphs of science are ! "
121435	121450	121428	121429	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" They 'll be linking us with the moon next but who was that ? "
121451	121454	121455	121455	Katharine	133	" William , "
121461	121490	121428	121429	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I 'll forgive William anything , for I 'm certain that there are n't any Williams in the moon . I hope he 's coming to luncheon ? "
121491	121498	121532	121532	She	133	" He 's coming to tea . "
121499	121516	121428	121429	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Well , that 's better than nothing , and I promise to leave you alone . "
121517	121528	121530	121530	Katharine	133	" There 's no need for you to do that , "
122227	122231	122232	122232	she	133	" Whose voice ? "
122309	122338	122376	122376	She	133	" I 've looked out the train .... Early on Saturday afternoon would suit me best .... I 'm Ralph Denham .... But I 'll write it down .... "
122358	122375	122355	122355	Katharine	133	" I think I could come . I 'll look at my engagements .... Hold on . "
122693	122703	122704	122704	she	134	" Who is lying ill in bed , Katharine ? "
122707	122757	122758	122758	she	134	" Which of our friends wants cheering up ? Who feels that they 've been forgotten and passed over , and that nobody wants them ? Whose water rates are overdue , and the cook leaving in a temper without waiting for her wages ? There was somebody I know "
123192	123196	123197	123197	Katharine	133	" Good Heavens ! "
123207	123218	123197	123197	Katharine	133	" I suppose I ought to make up my mind . "
123985	123994	123979	123979	Mary	179	" I 'm in love I 'm in love "
125109	125113	125090	125090	her	134	" our things . "
125157	125190	125191	125191	She	133	" This table is my grandfather 's writing - table . Most of the later poems were written at it . And this is his pen the last pen he ever used . "
125206	125209	125210	125210	she	133	" Here , "
125213	125251	125252	125252	she	133	" is the original manuscript of the ' Ode to Winter . ' The early manuscripts are far less corrected than the later ones , as you will see directly .... Oh , do take it yourself , "
125282	125293	125294	125296	the American lady	2994	" You are wonderfully like your grandfather , Miss Hilbery , "
125306	125327	125328	125328	she	2994	" especially about the eyes . Come , now , I expect she writes poetry herself , does n't she ? "
125339	125409	125328	125328	she	2994	" Quite one 's ideal of a poet , is it not , Mr. Rodney ? I can not tell you what a privilege I feel it to be standing just here with the poet 's granddaughter . You must know we think a great deal of your grandfather in America , Miss Hilbery . We have societies for reading him aloud . What ! His very own slippers ! "
125788	125791	125771	125771	she	302	" fascinating . "
126742	126766	126727	126727	her	335	" Come and sit down , William . How glad I was you were here ! I felt myself getting ruder and ruder . "
126767	126777	126778	126778	he	180	" You are not good at hiding your feelings , "
126782	126796	126797	126797	She	335	" Oh , do n't scold me I 've had a horrid afternoon . "
127091	127097	127099	127099	Katharine	335	" A letter from Cassandra ? "
127114	127133	127099	127099	Katharine	335	" I 've just written to ask her to come here , only I forgot to post it . "
127168	127171	127172	127172	she	335	" Yes , "
127177	127183	127172	127172	she	335	" a very charming letter . "
127216	127222	127223	127223	William	180	" I see no harm , "
127227	127246	127223	127223	William	180	" in helping her with Greek , for example if she really cares for that sort of thing . "
127247	127258	127260	127260	Katharine	335	" There 's no reason why she should n't care , "
127268	127290	127260	127260	Katharine	335	" In fact ah , here it is ' The Greek alphabet is absolutely FASCINATING . ' Obviously she does care . "
127291	127380	127223	127223	William	180	" Well , Greek may be rather a large order . I was thinking chiefly of English . Her criticisms of my play , though they 're too generous , evidently immature she ca n't be more than twenty - two , I suppose ? they certainly show the sort of thing one wants : real feeling for poetry , understanding , not formed , of course , but it 's at the root of everything after all . There 'd be no harm in lending her books ? "
127381	127387	127260	127260	Katharine	335	" No . Certainly not . "
127388	127422	127423	127423	he	180	" But if it hum led to a correspondence ? I mean , Katharine , I take it , without going into matters which seem to me a little morbid , I mean , "
127426	127464	127423	127423	he	180	" you , from your point of view , feel that there 's nothing disagreeable to you in the notion ? If so , you 've only to speak , and I never think of it again . "
127605	127610	127611	127611	he	180	" She loves me , "
127879	127890	127891	127891	she	134	" The best of all my treasures , Mr. Pelham ! "
127894	127913	127891	127891	she	134	" Do n't move , Katharine . Sit still , William . Mr. Pelham will come another day . "
127964	127972	127973	127973	she	335	" As I told you last night , "
127976	128032	127973	127973	she	335	" I think it 's your duty , if there 's a chance that you care for Cassandra , to discover what your feeling is for her now . It 's your duty to her , as well as to me . But we must tell my mother . We ca n't go on pretending . "
128033	128044	128046	128046	Rodney	180	" That is entirely in your hands , of course , "
128062	128066	128068	128068	Katharine	335	" Very well , "
128101	128106	128107	128107	Rodney	180	" But , Katharine , "
128122	128136	128107	128107	Rodney	180	" if Cassandra should Cassandra you 've asked Cassandra to stay with you . "
128137	128148	128149	128149	He	180	" Yes ; but I 've not posted the letter . "
128353	128366	128367	128367	she	335	" I 'm to give up my freedom for an indefinite time , "
128370	128425	128367	128367	she	335	" in order that William may see Cassandra here at his ease . He 's not the courage to manage it without my help he 's too much of a coward to tell me openly what he wants . He hates the notion of a public breach . He wants to keep us both . "
128656	128663	128664	128664	he	180	" I leave you , then , "
128687	128701	128664	128664	he	180	" to tell your mother that our engagement is ended by your desire . "
128710	128717	128718	128718	she	335	" You do n't trust me ? "
128721	128727	128728	128728	he	180	" I do , absolutely , "
128731	128748	128718	128718	she	335	" No . You do n't trust me to help you .... I could help you ? "
128749	128757	128758	128758	he	180	" I 'm hopeless without your help ! "
128789	128846	128847	128847	he	180	" It 's useless to pretend that I do n't understand what you 're offering , Katharine . I admit what you say . Speaking to you perfectly frankly , I believe at this moment that I do love your cousin ; there is a chance that , with your help , I might but no , "
128851	128872	128847	128847	he	180	" it 's impossible , it 's wrong I 'm infinitely to blame for having allowed this situation to arise . "
128873	128882	128776	128776	she	335	" Sit beside me . Let 's consider sensibly "
128883	128890	128891	128891	he	180	" Your sense has been our undoing "
128894	128900	128776	128776	she	335	" I accept the responsibility . "
128901	128910	128911	128911	he	180	" Ah , but can I allow that ? "
128914	128948	128911	128911	he	180	" It would mean for we must face it , Katharine that we let our engagement stand for the time nominally ; in fact , of course , your freedom would be absolute . "
128949	128954	128776	128776	she	335	" And yours too . "
128955	129016	128911	128911	he	180	" Yes , we should both be free . Let us say that I saw Cassandra once , twice , perhaps , under these conditions ; and then if , as I think certain , the whole thing proves a dream , we tell your mother instantly . Why not tell her now , indeed , under pledge of secrecy ? "
129017	129039	128776	128776	she	335	" Why not ? It would be over London in ten minutes , besides , she would never even remotely understand . "
129040	129054	128911	128911	he	180	" Your father , then ? This secrecy is detestable it 's dishonorable . "
129055	129066	128776	128776	she	335	" My father would understand even less than my mother . "
129067	129077	129078	129078	Rodney	180	" Ah , who could be expected to understand ? "
129081	129126	129078	129078	Rodney	180	" but it 's from your point of view that we must look at it . It 's not only asking too much , it 's putting you into a position a position in which I could not endure to see my own sister . "
129127	129135	129136	129136	she	3069	" We 're not brothers and sisters , "
129140	129157	129158	129158	she	3069	" and if we ca n't decide , who can ? I 'm not talking nonsense , "
129161	129204	129158	129158	she	3069	" I 've done my best to think this out from every point of view , and I 've come to the conclusion that there are risks which have to be taken , though I do n't deny that they hurt horribly . "
129205	129217	129078	129078	Rodney	180	" Katharine , you mind ? You 'll mind too much . "
129218	129224	129225	129225	she	3069	" No I sha n't , "
129229	129281	129225	129225	she	3069	" I shall mind a good deal , but I 'm prepared for that ; I shall get through it , because you will help me . You 'll both help me . In fact , we 'll help each other . That 's a Christian doctrine , is n't it ? "
129282	129291	129292	129292	Rodney	180	" It sounds more like Paganism to me , "
129491	129498	129499	129499	he	180	" We will help each other , "
129529	129535	129536	129536	she	335	" He 's already gone , "
129539	129549	129536	129536	she	335	" far away he thinks of me no more . "
129688	129692	129693	129693	she	134	" Dearest William , "
129722	129726	129727	129727	she	134	" Dearest children , "
130324	130336	130337	130337	he	158	" Here she comes , like a ship in full sail , "
130415	130431	130432	130432	she	3086	" Why did you never tell me ? I did n't know there was this , "
130484	130492	130493	130493	Denham	158	" You 've never been to Kew ? "
130624	130630	130631	130631	she	3086	" It 's so peaceful , "
131707	131716	131699	131699	She	133	" I 've left my bag somewhere where ? "
131817	131827	131828	131828	Katharine	335	" A purse a ticket some letters , papers , "
131996	132006	131991	131991	He	158	" Do n't let 's discuss that dreary business . "
132007	132011	131991	131991	He	158	" But I thought "
132012	132026	131991	131991	He	158	" It 's a dreary business . I ought never to have bothered you "
132027	132034	131991	131991	He	158	" Have you decided , then ? "
132041	132050	132035	132035	He	158	" It 's not a thing that matters . "
132058	132061	132051	132051	She	335	" Oh ! "
132062	132080	132081	132081	he	158	" I mean it matters to me , but it matters to no one else . Anyhow , "
132087	132103	132081	132081	he	158	" I see no reason why you should be bothered with other people 's nuisances . "
132122	132133	132134	132134	she	335	" I 'm afraid I 've been absent - minded , "
132148	132161	132162	132162	he	158	" You have a good deal to make you absent - minded , "
132165	132168	132169	132169	she	335	" Yes , "
132174	132177	132178	132178	she	335	" No , "
132182	132230	132178	132178	she	335	" Nothing particular , I mean . But I was thinking about plants . I was enjoying myself . In fact , I 've seldom enjoyed an afternoon more . But I want to hear what you 've settled , if you do n't mind telling me . "
132231	132239	132240	132240	he	158	" Oh , it 's all settled , "
132243	132257	132240	132240	he	158	" I 'm going to this infernal cottage to write a worthless book . "
132258	132264	132265	132265	she	335	" How I envy you , "
132273	132287	132240	132240	he	158	" Well , cottages are to be had for fifteen shillings a week . "
132288	132296	132297	132297	she	335	" Cottages are to be had yes , "
132300	132304	132297	132297	she	335	" The question is "
132309	132318	132319	132319	she	335	" Two rooms are all I should want , "
132327	132399	132400	132400	She	335	" one for eating , one for sleeping . Oh , but I should like another , a large one at the top , and a little garden where one could grow flowers . A path so down to a river , or up to a wood , and the sea not very far off , so that one could hear the waves at night . Ships just vanishing on the horizon "
132404	132412	132400	132400	She	335	" Shall you be near the sea ? "
132413	132420	132421	132421	he	3117	" My notion of perfect happiness , "
132430	132439	132421	132421	he	3117	" is to live as you 've said . "
132440	132454	132455	132455	she	335	" Well , now you can . You will work , I suppose , "
132458	132486	132455	132455	she	335	" you 'll work all the morning and again after tea and perhaps at night . You wo n't have people always coming about you to interrupt . "
132487	132495	132496	132496	he	3117	" How far can one live alone ? "
132499	132505	132496	132496	he	3117	" Have you tried ever ? "
132506	132512	132513	132513	she	335	" Once for three weeks , "
132516	132599	132600	132600	she	3118	" My father and mother were in Italy , and something happened so that I could n't join them . For three weeks I lived entirely by myself , and the only person I spoke to was a stranger in a shop where I lunched a man with a beard . Then I went back to my room by myself and well , I did what I liked . It does n't make me out an amiable character , I 'm afraid , "
132603	132658	132600	132600	she	3118	" but I ca n't endure living with other people . An occasional man with a beard is interesting ; he 's detached ; he lets me go my way , and we know we shall never meet again . Therefore , we are perfectly sincere a thing not possible with one 's friends . "
132659	132662	132663	132663	Denham	158	" Nonsense , "
132667	132673	132674	132674	she	3118	" Why ' nonsense ' ? "
132677	132687	132688	132688	he	158	" Because you do n't mean what you say , "
132691	132697	132698	132698	she	3118	" You 're very positive , "
132816	132825	132826	132826	she	3118	" I do n't mean what I say , "
132832	132835	132826	132826	she	3118	" Well ? "
132836	132849	132850	132850	he	158	" I doubt whether you make absolute sincerity your standard in life , "
132980	132992	132993	132993	she	3118	" Absolute sincerity is rather difficult , do n't you think ? "
133002	133012	133013	133013	he	158	" There are people one credits even with that , "
133190	133206	133207	133207	She	3118	" I went back to my room by myself and I did what I liked . "
133398	133420	133421	133421	she	3118	" Do n't you see that if you have no relations with people it 's easier to be honest with them ? "
133424	133484	133421	133421	she	3118	" That is what I meant . One need n't cajole them ; one 's under no obligation to them . Surely you must have found with your own family that it 's impossible to discuss what matters to you most because you 're all herded together , because you 're in a conspiracy , because the position is false "
133553	133558	133559	133559	he	158	" I 'm convinced , "
133562	133604	133559	133559	he	158	" that there are cases in which perfect sincerity is possible cases where there 's no relationship , though the people live together , if you like , where each is free , where there 's no obligation upon either side . "
133605	133611	133612	133612	she	3118	" For a time perhaps , "
133619	133649	133612	133612	she	3118	" But obligations always grow up . There are feelings to be considered . People are n't simple , and though they may mean to be reasonable , they end "

133671	133674	133675	133675	Denham	158	" Because , "
133679	133698	133699	133699	he	158	" they do n't make themselves understood at the beginning . I could undertake , at this instant , "
133716	133733	133699	133699	he	158	" to lay down terms for a friendship which should be perfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward . "
133811	133824	133825	133825	he	158	" In the first place , such a friendship must be unemotional , "
133831	133903	133825	133825	he	158	" At least , on both sides it must be understood that if either chooses to fall in love , he or she does so entirely at his own risk . Neither is under any obligation to the other . They must be at liberty to break or to alter at any moment . They must be able to say whatever they wish to say . All this must be understood . "
133904	133912	133913	133913	she	3118	" And they gain something worth having ? "
133916	133928	133929	133929	he	158	" It 's a risk of course it 's a risk , "
133950	133964	133965	133965	he	158	" But it 's the only way if you think friendship worth having , "
133968	133977	133978	133978	she	3118	" Perhaps under those conditions it might be , "
133982	133985	133986	133986	he	158	" Well , "
133989	134003	133986	133986	he	158	" those are the terms of the friendship I wish to offer you . "
134038	134044	134045	134045	she	3118	" I should like it , "
134048	134050	134045	134045	she	3118	" but "
134051	134056	134032	134032	she	3118	" Would Rodney mind ? "
134057	134061	134062	134062	she	3118	" Oh no , "
134066	134076	134077	134077	she	3118	" No , no , it is n't that , "
134431	134434	134435	134435	she	3118	" Now , "
134438	134446	134435	134435	she	3118	" let 's go and have tea . "

135870	135874	135875	135875	Cassandra	335	" My dear , "
135885	135910	135875	135875	Cassandra	335	" my whole life 's changed from this moment ! I must write the man 's name down at once , or I shall forget "
135941	135949	135950	135950	Cassandra	335	" May I sit and watch you ? "
135958	135965	135950	135950	Cassandra	335	" I got ready on purpose . "
135966	135976	135978	135978	Katharine	335	" Oh , you 're ready , are you ? "
136008	136015	136016	136016	she	335	" There are people dining here , "
136102	136109	136110	136110	Cassandra	335	" Who 's coming to dinner ? "
136119	136135	136329	136329	She	335	" There 's William , and , I believe , Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Aubrey . "
136136	136173	136329	136329	She	335	" I 'm so glad William is coming . Did he tell you that he sent me his manuscript ? I think it 's wonderful I think he 's almost good enough for you , Katharine . "
136174	136190	136329	136329	She	335	" You shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him . "
136191	136199	136200	136200	Cassandra	335	" I sha n't dare do that , "
136203	136216	136329	136329	She	335	" Why ? You 're not afraid of him , are you ? "
136217	136227	136329	136329	She	335	" A little because he 's connected with you . "
136231	136328	136329	136329	She	335	" But then , with your well - known fidelity , considering that you 're staying here at least a fortnight , you wo n't have any illusions left about me by the time you go . I give you a week , Cassandra . I shall see my power fading day by day . Now it 's at the climax ; but to - morrow it 'll have begun to fade . What am I to wear , I wonder ? Find me a blue dress , Cassandra , over there in the long wardrobe . "
136865	136868	136863	136863	she	335	" reality . "
137067	137076	137077	137077	he	340	" Were there any buds on the trees ? "
137080	137088	137077	137077	he	340	" Which line did she travel by ? "
137266	137281	137282	137282	she	335	" There 's no doubt what YOU do in a railway carriage , William , "
137295	137311	137282	137282	she	335	" You never ONCE look out of the window ; you read ALL the time . "
137312	137322	137323	137324	Mr. Peyton	340	" And what facts do you deduce from that ? "
137327	137339	137341	137341	Cassandra	335	" Oh , that he 's a poet , of course , "
137343	137368	137369	137369	she	335	" But I must confess that I knew that before , so it is n't fair . I 've got your manuscript with me , "
137381	137397	137369	137369	she	335	" I 've got all sorts of things I want to ask you about it . "
137486	137491	137492	137492	she	335	" First of all , "
137495	137508	137492	137492	she	335	" I want to know why you chose to write a play ? "
137509	137519	137481	137481	her	335	" Ah ! You mean it 's not dramatic ? "
137520	137581	137582	137582	she	335	" I mean that I do n't see what it would gain by being acted . But then does Shakespeare gain ? Henry and I are always arguing about Shakespeare . I 'm certain he 's wrong , but I ca n't prove it because I 've only seen Shakespeare acted once in Lincoln . But I 'm quite positive , "
137585	137593	137582	137582	she	335	" that Shakespeare wrote for the stage . "
137594	137600	137601	137601	Rodney	180	" You 're perfectly right , "
137604	137645	137601	137601	Rodney	180	" I was hoping you were on that side . Henry 's wrong entirely wrong . Of course , I 've failed , as all the moderns fail . Dear , dear , I wish I 'd consulted you before . "
137766	137776	137777	137777	she	335	" You 've not read ' The Idiot ' ! "
137780	137790	137791	137791	William	180	" I 've read ' War and Peace ' , "
137798	137805	137806	137806	she	335	" ' WAR AND PEACE ' ! "
137815	137825	137791	137791	William	180	" I confess I do n't understand the Russians . "
137826	137833	137835	137836	Uncle Aubrey	339	" Shake hands ! Shake hands ! "
137842	137857	137835	137836	Uncle Aubrey	339	" Neither do I. And I hazard the opinion that they do n't themselves . "
137977	137987	137988	137988	she	203	" Insanity is not a fit subject for fiction , "
137992	138003	138009	138009	his	138	" There 's the well - known case of Hamlet , "
138017	138027	138034	138034	she	203	" Ah , but poetry 's different , Trevor , "
138044	138076	138034	138034	she	203	" Different altogether . And I 've never thought , for my part , that Hamlet was as mad as they make out . What is your opinion , Mr. Peyton ? "
138173	138179	138180	138180	she	134	" Lovely , lovely Ophelia ! "
138183	138271	138180	138180	she	134	" What a wonderful power it is poetry ! I wake up in the morning all bedraggled ; there 's a yellow fog outside ; little Emily turns on the electric light when she brings me my tea , and says , ' Oh , ma'am , the water 's frozen in the cistern , and cook 's cut her finger to the bone . ' And then I open a little green book , and the birds are singing , the stars shining , the flowers twinkling "
138291	138300	138301	138302	Aunt Eleanor	203	" Has the cook cut her finger badly ? "
138311	138326	138328	138329	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Oh , the cook 's finger is only my way of putting it , "
138331	138349	138350	138350	she	134	" But if she had cut her arm off , Katharine would have sewn it on again , "
138371	138379	138380	138380	she	134	" But what horrid , horrid thoughts , "
138394	138408	138380	138380	she	134	" Come , let us find something more cheerful to talk about upstairs . "
138609	138616	138617	138617	Katharine	335	" What are you laughing at ? "
138631	138653	138654	138654	Katharine	335	" It was nothing ridiculous in the worst of taste , but still , if you half shut your eyes and looked "
138733	138741	138742	138742	Cassandra	335	" I utterly refuse to tell you ! "
138797	138814	138815	138815	he	180	" Ah , but you 're cruel to make me feel the barbarity of my sex , "
138838	138867	138815	138815	he	180	" We 've been discussing all sorts of dull things , and now I shall never know what I want to know more than anything in the world . "
138868	138878	138879	138879	she	335	" You do n't deceive us for a minute ! "
138882	138905	138879	138879	she	335	" Not for a second . We both know that you 've been enjoying yourself immensely . Has n't he , Katharine ? "
138906	138909	138910	138910	she	335	" No , "
138913	138930	138910	138910	she	335	" I think he 's speaking the truth . He does n't care much for politics . "
138961	138966	138949	138949	William	180	" I detest politics . "
138967	138981	138983	138983	Cassandra	335	" I do n't think any man has the right to say that , "
138988	138999	139000	139000	he	180	" I agree . I mean that I detest politicians , "
139005	139019	139020	139020	Katharine	335	" You see , I believe Cassandra is what they call a Feminist , "
139024	139067	139068	139068	She	335	" Or rather , she was a Feminist six months ago , but it 's no good supposing that she is now what she was then . That is one of her greatest charms in my eyes . One never can tell . "
139079	139090	139091	139091	Cassandra	335	" Katharine , you make one feel so horribly small ! "
139094	139106	139107	139107	Rodney	180	" No , no , that 's not what she means , "
139110	139135	139107	139107	Rodney	180	" I quite agree that women have an immense advantage over us there . One misses a lot by attempting to know things thoroughly . "
139136	139142	139144	139144	Katharine	335	" He knows Greek thoroughly , "
139146	139177	139144	139144	Katharine	335	" But then he also knows a good deal about painting , and a certain amount about music . He 's very cultivated perhaps the most cultivated person I know . "
139178	139182	139183	139183	Cassandra	335	" And poetry , "
139186	139195	139196	139196	Katharine	335	" Yes , I was forgetting his play , "
139249	139252	139253	139253	she	335	" Henry , "
139258	139296	139253	139253	she	335	" would say that a stage ought to be no bigger than this drawing - room . He wants there to be singing and dancing as well as acting only all the opposite of Wagner you understand ? "
139416	139433	139434	139434	she	335	" If anybody says anything , I shall say that I 'm looking at the river , "
139874	139881	139883	139884	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Ah , there she is , "
139903	139921	139922	139922	he	138	" Come here , Katharine . I could n't see where you 'd got to our children , "
139926	139990	139922	139922	he	138	" have their uses I want you to go to my study , Katharine ; go to the third shelf on the right - hand side of the door ; take down ' Trelawny 's Recollections of Shelley ' ; bring it to me . Then , Peyton , you will have to admit to the assembled company that you have been mistaken . "
139991	140010	140011	140011	Katharine	335	" ' Trelawny 's Recollections of Shelley . ' The third shelf on the right of the door , "
140045	140050	140052	140052	William	180	" Stop , Katharine , "
140067	140072	140073	140073	He	180	" Let me go . "
140124	140129	140130	140130	she	335	" Are you happy ? "
140133	140139	140140	140140	Cassandra	335	" Oh , my dear ! "
140151	140164	140165	140165	she	335	" Of course , we disagree about every subject under the sun , "
140168	140189	140190	140190	she	335	" but I think he 's the cleverest man I 've ever met and you 're the most beautiful woman , "
140228	140238	140240	140240	Katharine	335	" Ah , but it 's only ten o'clock , "
140243	140251	140252	140252	She	335	" As late as that ! Well ? "
140257	140288	140289	140289	Cassandra	335	" At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go . The illusion fades . But I accept my fate . I make hay while the sun shines . "
140298	140316	140317	140317	she	335	" Here 's Katharine talking about rats , and hay , and all sorts of odd things , "
140331	140338	140326	140326	He	180	" Can you make her out ? "
140373	140408	140361	140361	She	335	" I really am off , though . I wish you 'd explain if they say anything , William . I sha n't be late , but I 've got to see some one . "
140409	140416	140417	140417	Cassandra	335	" At this time of night ? "
140420	140428	140429	140429	William	180	" Whom have you got to see ? "
140432	140436	140437	140437	she	335	" A friend , "
140473	140481	140483	140483	William	180	" Katharine has a great many friends , "
140739	140746	140747	140747	Mary	179	" Have you been dining out ? "
140750	140755	140756	140756	Katharine	335	" Are you working ? "
140780	140786	140787	140787	Mary	179	" Well , not exactly , "
140790	140819	140787	140787	Mary	179	" Mr. Basnett had brought some papers to show me . We were going through them , but we 'd almost done .... Tell us about your party . "
140920	140925	140890	140891	Mr. Basnett	345	" very able young men "

141364	141376	141377	141377	Katharine	335	" No , at home . Are you starting something new ? "
141388	141392	141393	141394	Mr. Basnett	345	" We are , "
141402	141414	141415	141415	Mary	345	" I 'm thinking of leaving our friends in Russell Square , "
141418	141430	141393	141394	Mr. Basnett	345	" I see . And then you will do something else . "
141431	141441	141443	141443	Mary	345	" Well , I 'm afraid I like working , "
141445	141448	141450	141451	Mr. Basnett	345	" Afraid , "
141473	141476	141478	141478	Katharine	335	" Yes , "
141489	141509	141482	141482	he	345	" I should like to start something something off one 's own bat that 's what I should like . "
141510	141518	141520	141521	Mr. Basnett	345	" Yes , that 's the fun , "
141538	141551	141553	141553	Mary	345	" But you ca n't limit work that 's what I mean , "
141555	141576	141553	141553	Mary	345	" I mean there are other sorts of work . No one works harder than a woman with little children . "
141577	141581	141583	141584	Mr. Basnett	345	" Quite so , "
141586	141601	141583	141584	Mr. Basnett	345	" It 's precisely the women with babies we want to get hold of . "
141695	141702	141703	141703	she	335	" When will the public know ? "
141706	141713	141714	141715	Mr. Basnett	345	" What d'you mean about us ? "
141723	141730	141732	141732	Mary	345	" That depends upon many things , "
141762	141782	141783	141784	Mr. Basnett	345	" In starting a society such as we wish to start we ca n't say any more at present , "
141795	141864	141792	141792	his	345	" there are two things to remember the Press and the public . Other societies , which shall be nameless , have gone under because they 've appealed only to cranks . If you do n't want a mutual admiration society , which dies as soon as you 've all discovered each other 's faults , you must nobble the Press . You must appeal to the public . "
141865	141871	141873	141873	Mary	345	" That 's the difficulty , "
141876	141884	141886	141887	Mr. Basnett	345	" That 's where she comes in , "
141897	141952	141953	141953	he	345	" She 's the only one of us who 's a capitalist . She can make a whole - time job of it . I 'm tied to an office ; I can only give my spare time . Are you , by any chance , on the look - out for a job ? "
141966	141974	141975	141975	Mary	345	" Marriage is her job at present , "
141980	141986	141988	141989	Mr. Basnett	345	" Oh , I see , "
142247	142264	142241	142241	she	335	" Well , you 'll ask me to join when the time comes , I hope . "
142338	142342	142343	142343	Katharine	335	" Go back , "
142358	142371	142373	142373	Mary	345	" You ca n't wander about the streets alone in those clothes , "
142441	142447	142448	142448	she	335	" Have you seen Ralph ? "
142455	142458	142460	142460	Katharine	335	" Yes , "
142496	142503	142505	142505	Mary	345	" I believe I 'm jealous , "
142507	142512	142514	142514	Katharine	335	" Nonsense , Mary , "
142537	142561	142562	142562	Mary	345	" Let me see ; we went to Kew , and we agreed to be friends . Yes , that 's what happened . "
142581	142590	142591	142591	Mary	345	" It 's not a question of friendship , "
142603	142621	142622	142622	She	335	" You know it 's not . How can it be ? I 've no right to interfere "
142625	142635	142636	142636	she	335	" Only I 'd rather Ralph was n't hurt , "
142639	142651	142652	142652	Katharine	335	" I think he seems able to take care of himself , "
142671	142681	142683	142683	Mary	345	" Do you really think it 's worth it ? "
142689	142695	142696	142696	Katharine	335	" How can one tell ? "
142699	142708	142709	142709	Mary	345	" Have you ever cared for any one ? "
142715	142738	142696	142696	Katharine	335	" I ca n't wander about London discussing my feelings Here 's a cab no , there 's some one in it . "
142739	142747	142749	142749	Mary	345	" We do n't want to quarrel , "
142751	142766	142767	142767	Katharine	335	" Ought I to have told him that I would n't be his friend ? "
142770	142787	142767	142767	Katharine	335	" Shall I tell him that ? If so , what reason shall I give him ? "
142788	142798	142800	142800	Mary	345	" Of course you ca n't tell him that , "
142805	142813	142815	142815	Katharine	335	" I believe I shall , though , "
142818	142835	142767	142767	Katharine	335	" I lost my temper , Katharine ; I should n't have said what I did . "
142836	142843	142845	142845	Katharine	335	" The whole thing 's foolish , "
142849	142862	142863	142863	She	335	" That 's what I say . It 's not worth it . "
142911	142922	142923	142923	Katharine	335	" No , no , it 's not worth it , "
142926	142957	142958	142958	she	335	" Suppose , as you say , it 's out of the question this friendship ; he falls in love with me . I do n't want that . Still , "
142961	142980	142958	142958	she	335	" I believe you exaggerate ; love 's not everything ; marriage itself is only one of the things "
143060	143069	143072	143072	Mary	345	" I do n't lay down any rules , "
143089	143107	143108	143108	she	335	" All I say is that you should know what you 're about for certain ; but , "
143111	143117	143108	143108	she	335	" I expect you do . "
143188	143194	143196	143196	Katharine	335	" You must go in , "
143201	143215	143216	143216	She	335	" He 's waiting all this time to go on with his reading . "
143271	143282	143283	143283	she	335	" I think you underrate the value of that emotion , "
143344	143356	143357	143357	she	335	" Remember , I want to belong to your society remember , "
143492	143502	143503	143503	he	345	" I 'll go on where I left off , "
143506	143515	143503	143503	he	345	" Stop me if you want anything explained . "
143816	143819	143820	143820	he	180	" Katharine ! "
143823	143829	143830	143830	he	180	" You 've been out ? "
143833	143841	143805	143805	He	180	" Yes .... Are they still up ? "
143862	143874	143875	143875	he	180	" It 's been more wonderful than I can tell you , "
143878	143883	143875	143875	he	180	" I 'm incredibly happy "
143915	143948	143910	143910	he	180	" But tell me , how did it seem to you ? What did you think , Katharine ? Is there a chance that she likes me ? Tell me , Katharine ! "
143989	144018	143969	143969	He	180	" Good night , Katharine . Go to bed now . I shall see you soon . I hope I shall be able to come to - morrow . "
144081	144091	144092	144092	she	335	" What do you read in bed , Katharine ? "
144103	144110	144112	144112	Katharine	335	" Sometimes one thing sometimes another , "
144120	144129	144130	144130	she	335	" D'you know , you 're extraordinarily queer , "
144133	144151	144115	144115	Cassandra	335	" Every one seems to me a little queer . Perhaps it 's the effect of London . "
144152	144159	144160	144160	Katharine	335	" Is William queer , too ? "
144163	144173	144174	144174	Cassandra	335	" Well , I think he is a little , "
144177	144206	144207	144207	she	335	" Queer , but very fascinating . I shall read Milton to - night . It 's been one of the happiest nights of my life , Katharine , "
144508	144513	144500	144501	The Hilberys	152	" knew every one , "
145011	145017	145018	145018	she	335	" There 's Ralph Denham ! "
145021	145030	145031	145031	she	335	" I told him to meet us here , "
145153	145160	145161	145161	he	180	" One of Katharine 's friends , "
145426	145436	145437	145437	Ralph	158	" What have you been doing since we met ? "
145442	145445	145446	145446	she	335	" Doing ? "
145449	145468	145469	145469	she	335	" Walking in and out of other people 's houses . I wonder if these animals are happy ? "
145498	145509	145510	145510	Ralph	158	" I 'm afraid Rodney did n't like my coming , "
145513	145524	145525	145525	she	335	" No . But he 'll soon get over that , "
145598	145604	145605	145605	he	158	" The bears seem happy , "
145608	145634	145605	145605	he	158	" But we must buy them a bag of something . There 's the place to buy buns . Let 's go and get them . "
145691	145697	145699	145699	Ralph	158	" I wish to pay , "
145709	145719	145720	145720	he	158	" I have a reason for what I do , "
145732	145742	145743	145743	she	335	" I believe you have a reason for everything , "
145760	145779	145743	145743	she	335	" but I ca n't believe it 's a good one this time . What is your reason ? "
146233	146249	146227	146227	She	335	" Here you are ! Do prevent William from torturing this unfortunate aye - aye . "
146250	146258	146260	146260	William	180	" We thought we 'd lost you , "
146318	146326	146327	146327	she	335	" William is n't kind to animals , "
146330	146345	146327	146327	she	335	" He does n't know what they like and what they do n't like . "
146346	146360	146362	146362	Rodney	180	" I take it you 're well versed in these matters , Denham , "
146371	146384	146385	146385	Denham	158	" It 's mainly a question of knowing how to stroke them , "
146388	146398	146399	146399	Cassandra	335	" Which is the way to the Reptile House ? "
146450	146460	146461	146461	William	180	" I hope you 've had a pleasant afternoon , "
146464	146470	146471	146471	she	335	" I like Ralph Denham , "
146474	146479	146480	146480	William	180	" Ca se voit , "
146506	146514	146502	146502	Katharine	335	" Are you coming back to tea ? "
146515	146531	146532	146532	he	180	" Cassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland Place , "
146535	146550	146532	146532	he	180	" I do n't know whether you and Denham would care to join us . "
146551	146557	146558	146558	she	335	" I 'll ask him , "
146626	146644	146622	146622	William	180	" If you come , I hope you wo n't do your best to make me ridiculous . "
146645	146660	146661	146661	Katharine	335	" If that 's what you 're afraid of I certainly sha n't come , "
146821	146830	146831	146831	William	180	" You seem to delight in hurting me , "
146834	146848	146831	146831	William	180	" Why did you say that just now about my behavior to animals ? "
146876	146890	146891	146891	she	335	" Because it 's true . You never see what any one feels , "
146894	146903	146891	146891	she	335	" You think of no one but yourself . "
146904	146910	146912	146912	William	180	" That is not true , "
147028	147039	147040	147040	he	180	" I do n't know what you 're laughing at , "
147423	147426	147427	147427	he	180	" Anyhow , "
147430	147448	147427	147427	he	180	" I think we 've seen enough for one afternoon . Where have the others got to ? "
147467	147491	147449	147449	He	180	" We 'd better be independent of them . The best plan will be for you to come back to tea with me . "
147492	147501	147502	147502	she	3448	" Why should n't you come with me ? "
147505	147515	147516	147516	he	180	" Because we 're next door to Highgate here , "
147724	147730	147706	147709	the tremulous old lady	3460	" my son 's friends , "
147804	147815	147817	147817	Ralph	158	" I must warn you to expect a family party , "
147819	147835	147817	147817	Ralph	158	" They 're mostly in on Sundays . We can go to my room afterwards . "
147836	147844	147845	147845	she	3448	" Have you many brothers and sisters ? "
147853	147858	147859	147859	he	158	" Six or seven , "
147987	147995	147996	147996	he	158	" Mother , this is Miss Hilbery , "
148022	148040	148041	148041	she	3448	" I beg your pardon . I thought you were one of my own girls . Dorothy , "
148058	148086	148087	148087	she	3448	" we shall want some more methylated spirits unless the lamp itself is out of order . If one of you could invent a good spirit - lamp "
148256	148325	148246	148247	Mrs. Denham	349	" You see , Miss Hilbery , my children all come in at different hours and want different things . The tray should go up if you 've done , Johnnie . My boy Charles is in bed with a cold . What else can you expect ? standing in the wet playing football . We did try drawing - room tea , but it did n't do . "
148386	148394	148396	148396	Katharine	133	" It 's much nicer like this , "
148519	148525	148526	148526	she	133	" When I first married , "
148529	148571	148526	148526	she	133	" Highgate was quite separate from London , Miss Hilbery , and this house , though you would n't believe it , had a view of apple orchards . That was before the Middletons built their house in front of us . "
148572	148588	148590	148590	Katharine	133	" It must be a great advantage to live at the top of a hill , "
148608	148619	148620	148620	she	133	" Yes , indeed , we find it very healthy , "
148682	148693	148695	148695	Hester	351	" The ceiling 's fallen down in the pantry again , "
148704	148716	148717	148717	James	332	" The whole house will be down one of these days , "
148720	148723	148725	148726	Mrs. Denham	349	" Nonsense , "
148728	148757	148725	148726	Mrs. Denham	349	" It 's only a little bit of plaster I do n't see how any house could be expected to stand the wear and tear you give it . "
148778	148788	148789	148789	she	349	" Miss Hilbery 's thinking us all so rude , "
149268	149282	149327	149327	She	160	" Hullo , Joan ! There 's nothing left for you to eat , "
149465	149480	149481	149481	Johnnie	350	" Now , just let me hear you decline ' amo ' I love , "
149484	149496	149498	149498	Joan	160	" No , Johnnie , no Greek at meal - times , "
149504	149534	149535	149535	she	160	" She 's up at all hours of the night over her books , Miss Hilbery , and I 'm sure that 's not the way to pass examinations , "
149566	149581	149582	149582	Ralph	158	" Joan , you do n't really think that ' amo ' is Greek ? "
149585	149616	149535	149535	she	160	" Did I say Greek ? Well , never mind . No dead languages at tea - time . My dear boy , do n't trouble to make me any toast "
149617	149632	149634	149635	Mrs. Denham	349	" Or if you do , surely there 's the toasting - fork somewhere ? "
149650	149661	149662	149662	she	349	" Do one of you ring and ask for one , "
149674	149685	149686	149686	she	349	" But is Ann coming to be with Uncle Joseph ? "
149689	149701	149686	149686	she	349	" If so , surely they had better send Amy to us "
149830	149846	149848	149848	Johnnie	350	" You see , James likes to lie in bed and sleep like a hog , "
149869	149893	149856	149856	James	332	" Because Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep out . Johnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry "
150006	150023	150024	150024	he	158	" Yes , yes , that 's what I mean . She 's got it right , "
150236	150246	150247	150247	he	158	" Wo n't you come up to my room ? "
150296	150323	150291	150291	she	133	" The question is , then , at what point is it right for the individual to assert his will against the will of the State . "
150398	150405	150406	150406	she	133	" Your brothers are very clever , "
150409	150420	150406	150406	she	133	" I suppose you 're in the habit of arguing ? "
150421	150433	150434	150434	Ralph	158	" James and Johnnie will go on like that for hours , "
150437	150450	150434	150434	Ralph	158	" So will Hester , if you start her upon Elizabethan dramatists . "
150451	150460	150406	150406	she	133	" And the little girl with the pigtail ? "
150461	150477	150434	150434	Ralph	158	" Molly ? She 's only ten . But they 're always arguing among themselves . "
150509	150521	150522	150522	Katharine	133	" I see that it must be difficult to leave them , "
150653	150658	150659	150659	he	158	" My tame rook , "
150663	150673	150659	150659	he	158	" A cat had bitten one of its legs . "
150690	150697	150698	150698	she	133	" You sit here and read ? "
150722	150744	150745	150745	He	158	" The great advantage of Highgate is the view over London . At night the view from my window is splendid . "
150829	150835	150836	150836	she	133	" It must be late , "
150839	150845	150836	150836	she	133	" I must be going . "
150959	150965	150966	150966	he	158	" You 've won again , "
150974	150979	150980	150980	she	133	" I 've won ? "
150988	151000	151001	151001	he	158	" I wish to God I had n't asked you here , "
151005	151011	150980	150980	she	133	" What do you mean ? "
151012	151050	151051	151051	He	158	" When you 're here , it 's different I 'm happy . You 've only to walk to the window you 've only to talk about liberty . When I saw you down there among them all "
151055	151063	150980	150980	she	133	" You thought how ordinary I was . "
151064	151080	150980	150980	she	133	" I tried to think so . But I thought you more wonderful than ever . "
151105	151112	151113	151113	she	133	" I thought you disliked me , "
151116	151122	151123	151123	he	158	" God knows I tried , "
151126	151198	151123	151123	he	158	" I 've done my best to see you as you are , without any of this damned romantic nonsense . That was why I asked you here , and it 's increased my folly . When you 're gone I shall look out of that window and think of you . I shall waste the whole evening thinking of you . I shall waste my whole life , I believe . "
151222	151242	151243	151243	He	158	" This is what I foretold . We shall gain nothing but unhappiness . Look at me , Ralph . "
151248	151330	151243	151243	He	158	" I assure you that I 'm far more ordinary than I appear . Beauty means nothing whatever . In fact , the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid . I 'm not that , but I 'm a matter - of - fact , prosaic , rather ordinary character ; I order the dinner , I pay the bills , I do the accounts , I wind up the clock , and I never look at a book . "
151331	151334	151335	151335	he	158	" You forget "
151346	151435	151436	151436	she	133	" You come and see me among flowers and pictures , and think me mysterious , romantic , and all the rest of it . Being yourself very inexperienced and very emotional , you go home and invent a story about me , and now you ca n't separate me from the person you 've imagined me to be . You call that , I suppose , being in love ; as a matter of fact it 's being in delusion . All romantic people are the same , "
151439	151473	151436	151436	she	133	" My mother spends her life in making stories about the people she 's fond of . But I wo n't have you do it about me , if I can help it . "
151474	151481	151482	151482	he	3525	" You ca n't help it , "
151485	151497	151545	151545	They	3526	" I warn you it 's the source of all evil . "
151498	151504	151505	151505	he	3525	" And of all good , "
151508	151522	151545	151545	They	3526	" You 'll find out that I 'm not what you think me . "
151523	151535	151545	151545	They	3526	" Perhaps . But I shall gain more than I lose . "
151536	151544	151545	151545	They	3526	" If such gain 's worth having . "
151552	151562	151563	151563	he	3525	" That may be what we have to face , "
151566	151579	151563	151563	he	3525	" There may be nothing else . Nothing but what we imagine . "
151580	151587	151588	151588	she	3525	" The reason of our loneliness , "
151599	151607	151608	151608	he	3525	" When are you to be married ? "
151618	151632	151563	151563	he	3525	" Not till September , I think . It 's been put off . "
151633	151641	151642	151642	he	3525	" You wo n't be lonely then , "
151645	151687	151642	151642	he	3525	" According to what people say , marriage is a very queer business . They say it 's different from anything else . It may be true . I 've known one or two cases where it seems to be true . "
151753	151764	151765	151765	she	3525	" It may be put off even longer than that , "
151774	151802	151765	151765	she	3525	" Some one in the office is ill , and William has to take his place . We may put it off for some time in fact . "
151803	151815	151816	151816	Ralph	158	" That 's rather hard on him , is n't it ? "
151819	151825	151826	151826	she	3525	" He has his work , "
151829	151848	151849	151849	she	3525	" He has lots of things that interest him .... I know I 've been to that place , "
151858	151882	151849	151849	she	3525	" But I ca n't remember where it is oh , of course it 's Oxford . Now , what about your cottage ? "
151883	151892	151849	151849	she	3525	" I 'm not going to take it . "
151893	151900	151901	151901	she	3525	" How you change your mind ! "
151904	151910	151911	151911	he	158	" It 's not that , "
151915	151929	151911	151911	he	158	" It 's that I want to be where I can see you . "
151930	151945	151946	151946	she	3525	" Our compact is going to hold in spite of all I 've said ? "
151949	151960	151961	151961	he	158	" For ever , so far as I 'm concerned , "
151964	152002	151911	151911	he	158	" You 're going to go on dreaming and imagining and making up stories about me as you walk along the street , and pretending that we 're riding in a forest , or landing on an island "
152003	152026	152078	152078	her	3525	" No . I shall think of you ordering dinner , paying bills , doing the accounts , showing old ladies the relics "
152027	152032	152033	152033	she	3525	" That 's better , "
152036	152058	152033	152033	she	3525	" You can think of me to - morrow morning looking up dates in the ' Dictionary of National Biography . ' "
152059	152065	152066	152066	Ralph	158	" And forgetting your purse , "
153216	153221	153228	153228	he	158	" I love her . "
153233	153235	153228	153228	he	158	" love "
153266	153269	153270	153270	he	158	" love , "
153282	153291	153292	153292	he	158	" But I 'm in love with you ! "
153560	153567	153568	153568	she	3552	" Do you know each other ? "
153599	153608	153610	153610	Mary	345	" We were just going through some papers , "
153612	153637	153638	153638	she	3552	" Mr. Basnett has to help me , because I do n't know much about my work yet . It 's the new society , "
153641	153655	153638	153638	she	3552	" I 'm the secretary . I 'm no longer at Russell Square . "
153673	153679	153681	153681	Ralph	158	" What are your aims ? "
153775	153779	153781	153781	Ralph	158	" I see , "
153788	153794	153795	153795	he	158	" D'you know , Mary , "
153799	153814	153795	153795	he	158	" I believe I 'm in for a cold . Have you any quinine ? "
153888	153897	153900	153900	Ralph	158	" Of course , I agree with you , "
153912	153939	153909	153910	Mr. Basnett	345	" But there 's more that might be done . Have you seen Judson , for instance ? You should make a point of getting him . "
153946	153951	153952	153953	Mr. Basnett	345	" Judson 's address ? "
154031	154034	154036	154036	Ralph	158	" Mary , "
154051	154054	154055	154055	he	158	" Mary , "
154146	154153	154154	154154	she	133	" What is it , Ralph ? "
154301	154308	154309	154309	she	133	" You 'll stay and dine ? "
154318	154321	154322	154322	Ralph	158	" No , "
154360	154368	154369	154369	Ralph	158	" That 's a clever young man , "
154377	154486	154487	154487	She	3569	" I 'm glad you thought so . It 's tremendously interesting work , and considering everything , I think we 've done very well . But I 'm inclined to agree with you ; we ought to try to be more conciliatory . We 're absurdly strict . It 's difficult to see that there may be sense in what one 's opponents say , though they are one 's opponents . Horace Basnett is certainly too uncompromising . I must n't forget to see that he writes that letter to Judson . You 're too busy , I suppose , to come on to our committee ? "
154495	154503	154504	154504	Ralph	158	" I may be out of town , "
154513	154523	154524	154524	she	3569	" Our executive meets every week , of course , "
154527	154561	154524	154524	she	3569	" But some of our members do n't come more than once a month . Members of Parliament are the worst ; it was a mistake , I think , to ask them . "
154569	154577	154578	154578	she	3569	" You 've not taken your quinine , "
154591	154598	154600	154600	Ralph	158	" I do n't want it , "
154603	154610	154611	154611	she	3569	" Well , you know best , "
154615	154623	154624	154624	he	158	" Mary , I 'm a brute ! "
154627	154644	154624	154624	he	158	" Here I come and waste your time , and do nothing but make myself disagreeable . "
154645	154656	154657	154657	she	3569	" A cold coming on does make one feel wretched , "
154660	154717	154718	154718	He	158	" I 've not got a cold . That was a lie . There 's nothing the matter with me . I 'm mad , I suppose . I ought to have had the decency to keep away . But I wanted to see you I wanted to tell you I 'm in love , Mary . "
154736	154743	154744	154744	she	3569	" In love , are you ? "
154748	154755	154744	154744	she	3569	" I 'm glad , Ralph . "
154756	154901	154902	154902	He	3570	" I suppose I 'm in love . Anyhow , I 'm out of my mind . I ca n't think , I ca n't work , I do n't care a hang for anything in the world . Good Heavens , Mary ! I 'm in torment ! One moment I 'm happy ; next I 'm miserable . I hate her for half an hour ; then I 'd give my whole life to be with her for ten minutes ; all the time I do n't know what I feel , or why I feel it ; it 's insanity , and yet it 's perfectly reasonable . Can you make any sense of it ? Can you see what 's happened ? I 'm raving , I know ; do n't listen , Mary ; go on with your work . "
154996	155001	155003	155003	Mary	345	" Do sit down , "
155006	155011	155012	155012	She	3572	" You make me so "
155031	155047	155089	155089	his	158	" You have n't told me her name you 'd rather not , I suppose ? "
155048	155055	155089	155089	his	158	" Her name ? Katharine Hilbery . "
155056	155061	155089	155089	his	158	" But she 's engaged "
155062	155074	155089	155089	his	158	" To Rodney . They 're to be married in September . "
155075	155079	155081	155081	Mary	345	" I see , "
155292	155303	155304	155304	she	3572	" Is there anything that I could do for you ? "
155316	155339	155340	155340	He	158	" You could see her no , that 's not what I want ; you must n't bother about me , Mary . "
155348	155361	155362	155362	she	3572	" I 'm afraid no third person can do anything to help , "
155365	155368	155369	155369	he	158	" No , "
155374	155386	155371	155371	his	158	" Katharine was saying to - day how lonely we are . "
155461	155467	155468	155468	she	3572	" There 's always work , "
155479	155488	155489	155489	he	158	" Do you want to be working now ? "
155492	155501	155502	155502	she	3572	" No , no . It 's Sunday , "
155505	155556	155502	155502	she	3572	" I was thinking of Katharine . She does n't understand about work . She 's never had to . She does n't know what work is . I 've only found out myself quite lately . But it 's the thing that saves one I 'm sure of that . "
155557	155567	155568	155568	he	158	" There are other things , are n't there ? "
155571	155579	155580	155580	she	3572	" Nothing that one can count upon , "
155583	155589	155590	155590	she	3572	" After all , other people "
155600	155647	155595	155595	herself	3572	" Where should I be now if I had n't got to go to my office every day ? Thousands of people would tell you the same thing thousands of women . I tell you , work is the only thing that saved me , Ralph . "
155742	155752	155753	155753	she	3572	" It 's all turned out splendidly for me , "
155756	155780	155753	155753	she	3572	" It will for you , too . I 'm sure of that . Because , after all , Katharine is worth it . "
155781	155784	155785	155785	he	158	" Mary ! "
155806	155813	155814	155814	he	158	" Mary , you 're splendid , "
157484	157495	157496	157496	he	180	" Goodness , Denham , what are you doing here ? "
158015	158025	158026	158026	he	180	" Did you stay long after we 'd left ? "
158030	158040	158004	158004	she	335	" No . We went back to my house . "
158067	158075	158076	158076	he	180	" Women are incomprehensible creatures , Denham ! "
158080	158083	158085	158085	Denham	158	" Um , "
158136	158166	158190	158190	he	158	" You say something and they fly into a passion . Or for no reason at all , they laugh . I take it that no amount of education will "
158315	158327	158358	158358	Rodney	180	" You could n't laugh at some one you cared for . "
158363	158368	158371	158371	his	180	" You love her . "
158389	158399	158371	158371	his	180	" I 've suffered tortures , Denham , tortures ! "
158400	158409	158371	158371	his	180	" Yes , yes , I know that . "
158410	158417	158371	158371	his	180	" She 's laughed at me . "
158418	158423	158371	158371	his	180	" Never to me . "
158442	158449	158371	158371	his	180	" How I 've loved her ! "
158524	158543	158510	158510	he	180	" I am in love with Katharine myself . That is why I am here to - night . "
158566	158575	158576	158576	he	180	" Ah , I 've always known it , "
158579	158593	158576	158576	he	180	" I 've known it from the first . You 'll marry her ! "
158629	158641	158642	158642	Rodney	180	" My God , Denham , what fools we both are ! "
158890	158897	158869	158869	Cassandra	335	" Are you awake , Katharine ? "
158898	158909	158869	158869	Cassandra	335	" Yes , I 'm awake . What is it ? "
158928	158959	158910	158910	She	335	" I could n't sleep , and I thought I 'd come and speak to you only for a moment , though . I 'm going home to - morrow . "
158960	158969	158910	158910	She	335	" Home ? Why , what has happened ? "
158970	158986	158910	158910	She	335	" Something happened to - day which makes it impossible for me to stay here . "
159020	159050	159008	159008	She	335	" I have decided to tell you the whole truth , Katharine . William allowed himself to behave in a way which made me extremely uncomfortable to - day . "
159067	159072	159073	159073	she	335	" At the Zoo ? "
159076	159089	159051	159051	Katharine	335	" No , on the way home . When we had tea . "
159122	159130	159131	159131	she	335	" There 's a train at eleven , "
159134	159177	159131	159131	she	335	" I shall tell Aunt Maggie that I have to go suddenly .... I shall make Violet 's visit an excuse . But , after thinking it over , I do n't see how I can go without telling you the truth . "
159196	159210	159212	159212	Katharine	335	" But I do n't see the least reason why you should go , "
159279	159295	159296	159296	Cassandra	335	" Because I ca n't allow any man to behave to me in that way , "
159303	159317	159300	159300	she	335	" particularly when I know that he is engaged to some one else . "
159318	159328	159329	159329	Katharine	335	" But you like him , do n't you ? "
159332	159342	159343	159343	Cassandra	335	" That 's got nothing to do with it , "
159347	159360	159343	159343	Cassandra	335	" I consider his conduct , under the circumstances , most disgraceful . "
159395	159407	159392	159392	Katharine	335	" I should say it had everything to do with it , "
159416	159448	159392	159392	Katharine	335	" I do n't understand you in the least , Katharine . How can you behave as you behave ? Ever since I came here I 've been amazed by you ! "
159449	159459	159460	159460	Katharine	335	" You 've enjoyed yourself , have n't you ? "
159463	159469	159470	159470	Cassandra	335	" Yes , I have , "
159473	159484	159392	159392	Katharine	335	" Anyhow , my behavior has n't spoiled your visit . "
159485	159488	159489	159489	Cassandra	335	" No , "
159583	159595	159596	159596	she	335	" Do you think I 've been very foolish about it ? "
159683	159691	159674	159674	she	335	" But do you care for William ? "
159712	159724	159725	159725	Cassandra	335	" Do you mean , am I in love with him ? "
159737	159745	159746	159746	Katharine	335	" Yes , in love with him , "
159749	159762	159763	159763	Cassandra	335	" How can I love the man you 're engaged to marry ? "
159767	159776	159763	159763	Cassandra	335	" He may be in love with you . "
159777	159793	159794	159794	Cassandra	335	" I do n't think you 've any right to say such things , Katharine , "
159797	159829	159794	159794	Cassandra	335	" Why do you say them ? Do n't you mind in the least how William behaves to other women ? If I were engaged , I could n't bear it ! "
159830	159836	159838	159838	Katharine	335	" We 're not engaged , "
159844	159847	159848	159848	Cassandra	335	" Katharine ! "
159851	159859	159860	159860	Katharine	335	" No , we 're not engaged , "
159863	159872	159860	159860	Katharine	335	" But no one knows it but ourselves . "
159873	159885	159886	159886	Cassandra	335	" But why I do n't understand you 're not engaged ! "
159890	159913	159886	159886	Cassandra	335	" Oh , that explains it ! You 're not in love with him ! You do n't want to marry him ! "
159914	159926	159928	159928	Katharine	335	" We are n't in love with each other any longer , "
159940	159956	159957	159957	Cassandra	335	" How queer , how strange , how unlike other people you are , Katharine , "
159987	159996	160050	160050	She	335	" You 're not in love with him ? "
159997	160003	160005	160005	Katharine	335	" But I love him , "
160066	160074	160075	160075	she	335	" D'you know what time it is ? "
160145	160158	160159	160159	Cassandra	335	" There 's no reason why I should go home , then ? "
160164	160182	160159	160159	Cassandra	335	" Unless you want me to go , Katharine ? What DO you want me to do ? "
160191	160200	160201	160201	Cassandra	335	" You wanted us to fall in love , "
160291	160296	160298	160299	the maid	519	" Please , miss , "
160309	160317	160298	160299	the maid	519	" Mrs. Milvain is in the kitchen . "
160404	160411	160393	160394	the maid	519	" You know what that means . "
160417	160425	160426	160426	Katharine	335	" Aunt Celia is in the kitchen , "
160429	160435	160436	160436	Cassandra	335	" Why in the kitchen ? "
160442	160450	160451	160451	Katharine	335	" Probably because she 's discovered something , "
160465	160469	160470	160470	she	335	" About us ? "
160473	160477	160478	160478	Katharine	335	" Heaven knows , "
160481	160501	160478	160478	Katharine	335	" I sha n't let her stay in the kitchen , though . I shall bring her up here . "
160526	160534	160535	160535	Cassandra	335	" For goodness ' sake , Katharine , "
160548	160565	160535	160535	Cassandra	335	" do n't be rash . Do n't let her suspect . Remember , nothing 's certain "
160739	160753	160754	160754	she	222	" I 've something that I want to say to you in PRIVATE , "
160766	160773	160754	160754	she	222	" The drawing - room is empty "
160774	160791	160792	160793	Mrs. Milvain	222	" But we might meet your mother upon the stairs . We might disturb your father , "
160871	160877	160878	160878	she	222	" Nobody will overhear us ? "
160894	160903	160904	160904	she	222	" I see that I have interrupted you , "
160922	160930	160919	160919	she	222	" Was some one sitting with you ? "
160942	160954	160956	160956	Katharine	335	" Cassandra was helping me to put the flowers in water , "
160993	161002	161003	161003	she	222	" Ah , Cassandra is still with you , "
161006	161016	161003	161003	she	222	" And did William send you those lovely flowers ? "
161117	161124	161126	161126	Katharine	335	" They 're from Stogdon House , "
161196	161240	161180	161181	Mrs. Milvain	222	" People are talking about you , Katharine . That is why I have come this morning . You forgive me for saying what I 'd much rather not say ? What I say is only for your own sake , my child . "
161241	161252	161254	161254	Katharine	335	" There 's nothing to forgive yet , Aunt Celia , "
161261	161342	161343	161344	Mrs. Milvain	222	" People are saying that William goes everywhere with you and Cassandra , and that he is always paying her attentions . At the Markhams ' dance he sat out five dances with her . At the Zoo they were seen alone together . They left together . They never came back here till seven in the evening . But that is not all . They say his manner is very marked he is quite different when she is there . "
161471	161474	161475	161475	she	335	" Well ? "
161498	161539	161480	161481	Mrs. Milvain	222	" We all know how good you are how unselfish how you sacrifice yourself to others . But you 've been too unselfish , Katharine . You have made Cassandra happy , and she has taken advantage of your goodness . "
161540	161549	161551	161551	Katharine	335	" I do n't understand , Aunt Celia , "
161553	161559	161551	161551	Katharine	335	" What has Cassandra done ? "
161560	161575	161577	161578	Mrs. Milvain	222	" Cassandra has behaved in a way that I could not have thought possible , "
161581	161599	161577	161578	Mrs. Milvain	222	" She has been utterly selfish utterly heartless . I must speak to her before I go . "
161600	161606	161607	161607	Katharine	335	" I do n't understand , "
161646	161654	161636	161636	She	222	" Cassandra has stolen William 's love . "
161665	161670	161672	161672	Katharine	335	" Do you mean , "
161674	161684	161672	161672	Katharine	335	" that he has fallen in love with her ? "
161685	161700	161636	161636	She	222	" There are ways of MAKING men fall in love with one , Katharine . "
161716	161771	161712	161712	she	222	" Nothing would have made me say these things but your own good . I have not wished to interfere ; I have not wished to give you pain . I am a useless old woman . I have no children of my own . I only want to see you happy , Katharine . "
161784	161796	161798	161798	Katharine	335	" You are not going to say these things to Cassandra , "
161801	161813	161798	161798	Katharine	335	" You 've said them to me ; that 's enough . "
161844	161856	161857	161857	she	222	" I 've made you angry ! I knew I should ! "
161895	161898	161900	161900	Katharine	335	" Yes , "
161905	161937	161900	161900	Katharine	335	" I 'm so angry that I do n't want to say anything more . I think you 'd better go , Aunt Celia . We do n't understand each other . "
162014	162018	162019	162019	she	222	" Married love , "
162029	162090	162019	162019	she	222	" is the most sacred of all loves . The love of husband and wife is the most holy we know . That is the lesson Mamma 's children learnt from her ; that is what they can never forget . I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak . You are her grandchild . "
162109	162123	162124	162124	she	335	" I do n't see that there is any excuse for your behavior , "
162368	162376	162354	162354	he	180	" These are for you , Katharine . "
162548	162553	162554	162554	she	222	" I must go , "
162642	162650	162651	162651	he	180	" I 've come to be forgiven , "
162654	162682	162651	162651	he	180	" Our quarrel was perfectly hateful to me . I 've not slept all night . You 're not angry with me , are you , Katharine ? "
162738	162746	162747	162747	she	335	" She 's been spying upon us , "
162750	162761	162747	162747	she	335	" following us about London , overhearing what people are saying "
162762	162766	162767	162767	Rodney	180	" Mrs. Milvain ? "
162770	162777	162767	162767	Rodney	180	" What has she told you ? "
162786	162809	162747	162747	she	335	" Oh , people are saying that you 're in love with Cassandra , and that you do n't care for me . "
162810	162816	162817	162817	he	180	" They have seen us ? "
162820	162832	162747	162747	she	335	" Everything we 've done for a fortnight has been seen . "
162833	162841	162842	162842	he	180	" I told you that would happen ! "
162893	162901	162902	162902	he	180	" It 's all been a mistake , "
162905	162939	162902	162902	he	180	" I blame myself for it . I should have known better . I let you persuade me in a moment of madness . I beg you to forget my insanity , Katharine . "
162940	162948	162949	162949	Katharine	335	" She wished even to persecute Cassandra ! "
162958	162977	162949	162949	Katharine	335	" She threatened to speak to her . She 's capable of it she 's capable of anything ! "
162978	163018	163027	163027	he	180	" Mrs. Milvain is not tactful , I know , but you exaggerate , Katharine . People are talking about us . She was right to tell us . It only confirms my own feeling the position is monstrous . "
163030	163042	163043	163043	she	335	" You do n't mean that this influences you , William ? "
163048	163052	163053	163053	he	180	" It does , "
163058	163084	163085	163085	He	180	" It 's intensely disagreeable to me . I ca n't endure that people should gossip about us . And then there 's your cousin Cassandra "
163090	163099	163100	163100	he	180	" I came here this morning , Katharine , "
163109	163165	163100	163100	he	180	" to ask you to forget my folly , my bad temper , my inconceivable behavior . I came , Katharine , to ask whether we ca n't return to the position we were in before this this season of lunacy . Will you take me back , Katharine , once more and for ever ? "
163274	163286	163287	163287	she	335	" I was as much to blame as you were yesterday , "
163295	163327	163287	163287	she	335	" I confess , William , the sight of you and Cassandra together made me jealous , and I could n't control myself . I laughed at you , I know . "
163328	163332	163333	163333	William	180	" You jealous ! "
163336	163415	163333	163333	William	180	" I assure you , Katharine , you 've not the slightest reason to be jealous . Cassandra dislikes me , so far as she feels about me at all . I was foolish enough to try to explain the nature of our relationship . I could n't resist telling her what I supposed myself to feel for her . She refused to listen , very rightly . But she left me in no doubt of her scorn . "
163467	163472	163473	163473	Rodney	180	" She charmed me , "
163476	163533	163473	163473	Rodney	180	" I thought I loved her . But that 's a thing of the past . It 's all over , Katharine . It was a dream an hallucination . We were both equally to blame , but no harm 's done if you believe how truly I care for you . Say you believe me ! "
163721	163728	163729	163729	he	180	" Yes , yes , yes , "
163732	163743	163729	163729	he	180	" you accept me , Katharine . You love me . "
163757	163766	163754	163754	her	335	" Cassandra loves you more than I do . "
163767	163770	163771	163771	he	180	" Cassandra ? "
163774	163779	163780	163780	Katharine	335	" She loves you , "
163795	163800	163783	163783	She	335	" She loves you . "
163954	163959	163960	163960	she	335	" Yes , yes , "
163969	163982	163960	163960	she	335	" it 's true . I know what she feels for you . "
163983	163988	163938	163938	He	180	" She loves me ? "
163992	164033	163960	163960	she	335	" Ah , but who knows what I feel ? How can I be sure of my feeling myself ? Ten minutes ago I asked you to marry me . I still wish it I do n't know what I wish "
164049	164058	164042	164042	He	180	" Tell me what you feel for Denham . "
164059	164064	164065	164065	she	335	" For Ralph Denham ? "
164068	164071	164072	164072	she	335	" Yes ! "
164088	164128	164072	164072	she	335	" You 're jealous of me , William ; but you 're not in love with me . I 'm jealous of you . Therefore , for both our sakes , I say , speak to Cassandra at once . "
164184	164189	164190	164190	he	180	" You 're right , "
164211	164216	164190	164190	he	180	" I love Cassandra . "
164240	164247	164248	164248	she	335	" I have overheard every word ! "
164265	164280	164257	164257	Rodney	180	" Then you know what I wish to ask you . Give me your answer "
164301	164306	164307	164307	she	335	" What Katharine said , "
164310	164313	164314	164314	she	335	" But , "
164335	164365	164314	164314	she	335	" how frightfully difficult it all is ! Our feelings , I mean yours and mine and Katharine 's . Katharine , tell me , are we doing right ? "
164366	164375	164376	164376	William	180	" Right of course we 're doing right , "
164380	164401	164376	164376	William	180	" if , after what you 've heard , you can marry a man of such incomprehensible confusion , such deplorable "
164402	164408	164409	164409	Katharine	335	" Do n't , William , "
164412	164434	164409	164409	Katharine	335	" Cassandra has heard us ; she can judge what we are ; she knows better than we could tell her . "
164492	164502	164503	164503	she	335	" I must be first with him , Katharine ! "
164506	164516	164503	164503	she	335	" I ca n't share him even with you . "
164517	164524	164526	164526	Katharine	335	" I shall never ask that , "
164546	164554	164555	164555	Cassandra	335	" But you 've shared with me , "
164558	164579	164580	164580	she	335	" Why ca n't I share with you ? Why am I so mean ? I know why it is , "
164583	164604	164580	164580	she	335	" We understand each other , William and I. You 've never understood each other . You 're too different . "
164605	164613	164614	164614	William	180	" I 've never admired anybody more , "
164617	164622	164623	164623	Cassandra	335	" It 's not that "
164628	164633	164580	164580	she	335	" it 's understanding . "
164634	164649	164580	164580	she	335	" Have I never understood you , Katharine ? Have I been very selfish ? "
164650	164653	164654	164654	Cassandra	335	" Yes , "
164657	164706	164654	164654	Cassandra	335	" You 've asked her for sympathy , and she 's not sympathetic ; you 've wanted her to be practical , and she 's not practical . You 've been selfish ; you 've been exacting and so has Katharine but it was n't anybody 's fault . "
164747	164753	164754	164754	she	335	" It 's quite true , "
164757	164764	164754	164754	she	335	" It was nobody 's fault . "
164765	164779	164780	164780	Cassandra	335	" There are many things that he 'll always come to you for , "
164790	164825	164780	164780	Cassandra	335	" I accept that , Katharine . I shall never dispute it . I want to be generous as you 've been generous . But being in love makes it more difficult for me . "
164837	164846	164847	164847	he	180	" One thing I beg of you both , "
164863	164911	164858	164858	he	180	" We will never discuss these matters again . It 's not that I 'm timid and conventional , as you think , Katharine . It 's that it spoils things to discuss them ; it unsettles people 's minds ; and now we 're all so happy "
164947	164954	164955	164955	she	335	" Yes , I 'm happy , "
164959	164972	164955	164955	she	335	" And I agree . We will never talk about it again . "
164973	164980	164981	164981	Cassandra	335	" Oh , Katharine , Katharine ! "
165115	165120	165111	165111	she	335	" The Duchess of Malfi "
165464	165469	165470	165470	she	335	" What is it ? "
165527	165533	165534	165534	he	180	" There he is again , "
165537	165547	165534	165534	he	180	" Look , there under the lamp - post . "
165656	165659	165661	165661	Rodney	180	" Denham , "
165663	165671	165672	165672	He	180	" He was there last night too . "
165721	165727	165728	165728	she	335	" If he chooses to come "
165732	165750	165751	165751	Rodney	180	" You ca n't let him wait out there . I shall tell him to come in . "
165780	165783	165784	165784	she	335	" Wait ! "
165787	165794	165784	165784	she	335	" I do n't allow you . "
165795	165801	165802	165802	he	180	" You ca n't wait , "
165805	165812	165802	165802	he	180	" You 've gone too far . "
165820	165829	165830	165830	he	180	" Why do n't you admit , Katharine , "
165848	165865	165830	165830	he	180	" that you love him ? Are you going to treat him as you treated me ? "
165887	165896	165897	165897	she	335	" I forbid you to draw the curtain , "
165910	165918	165919	165919	he	180	" I 've no right to interfere , "
165922	165944	165919	165919	he	180	" I 'll leave you . Or , if you like , we 'll go back to the drawing - room . "
165945	165954	165955	165955	she	335	" No . I ca n't go back , "
165969	165976	165977	165977	Rodney	180	" You love him , Katharine , "
166014	166019	166020	166020	she	335	" I love him ? "
166095	166098	166099	166099	she	335	" Now , "
166152	166158	166159	166159	she	335	" He 's not there ! "
166207	166210	166211	166211	William	180	" Denham ! "
166214	166217	166219	166219	Katharine	335	" Ralph ! "
166290	166293	166284	166284	his	158	" Rodney ! "
166294	166304	166305	166305	Rodney	180	" There you are ! Come in , Denham . "
166315	166320	166321	166321	he	180	" Here he is , "
166426	166438	166439	166439	he	158	" You 're the first to hear the news , Denham , "
166442	166454	166439	166439	he	158	" Katharine is n't going to marry me , after all . "
166455	166460	166461	166461	Ralph	158	" Where shall I put "
166554	166561	166563	166563	Katharine	335	" William is engaged to Cassandra , "
166630	166635	166637	166637	Denham	158	" I congratulate you , "
166639	166656	166657	166657	he	180	" Yes , yes . We 're all mad quite out of our minds , Denham , "
166660	166670	166671	166671	He	180	" It 's partly Katharine 's doing partly mine . "
166698	166702	166703	166703	he	180	" Quite mad , "
166706	166709	166703	166703	he	180	" Even Katharine "
166742	166747	166748	166748	he	180	" Katharine shall explain , "
166855	166863	166864	166864	she	335	" Why were you waiting out there ? "
166867	166875	166876	166876	he	158	" For the chance of seeing you , "
166879	166915	166950	166950	him	158	" You would have waited all night if it had n't been for William . It 's windy too . You must have been cold . What could you see ? Nothing but our windows . "
166916	166928	166965	166965	She	335	" It was worth it . I heard you call me . "
166929	166934	166935	166935	She	335	" I called you ? "
166940	166947	166948	166948	she	335	" They were engaged this morning , "
166956	166961	166962	166962	he	158	" You 're glad ? "
166970	166975	166976	166976	she	335	" Yes , yes , "
166979	166995	166965	166965	She	335	" But you do n't know how good he is what he 's done for me "
167003	167011	167012	167012	she	335	" You waited there last night too ? "
167015	167022	167023	167023	Denham	158	" Yes . I can wait , "
167080	167086	167087	167087	she	335	" Waiting in the dark , "
167104	167111	167112	167112	She	335	" Ah , but it 's different "
167116	167133	167112	167112	She	335	" I 'm not the person you think me . Until you realize that it 's impossible "
167216	167223	167224	167224	he	158	" No , you 're right , "
167227	167240	167224	167224	he	158	" I do n't know you . I 've never known you . "
167241	167253	167254	167254	she	335	" Yet perhaps you know me better than any one else , "
167332	167342	167343	167343	he	158	" I say I do know you , Katharine , "
167350	167361	167343	167343	he	158	" It 's only for moments that I go mad . "
167362	167372	167497	167497	her	3779	" Do you call two whole nights a moment ? "
167373	167420	167343	167343	he	158	" I swear to you that now , at this instant , I see you precisely as you are . No one has ever known you as I know you .... Could you have taken down that book just now if I had n't known you ? "
167421	167426	167427	167427	she	3779	" That 's true , "
167430	167490	167491	167491	she	3779	" but you ca n't think how I 'm divided how I 'm at my ease with you , and how I 'm bewildered . The unreality the dark the waiting outside in the wind yes , when you look at me , not seeing me , and I do n't see you either .... But I do see , "
167503	167512	167491	167491	she	3779	" heaps of things , only not you . "
167513	167520	167521	167521	he	3780	" Tell me what you see , "
167582	167585	167586	167586	she	3779	" Impossible , "
167603	167608	167609	167609	Ralph	158	" Try , Katharine , "
167613	167634	167635	167635	She	3779	" But I ca n't I 'm talking a sort of nonsense the sort of nonsense one talks to oneself . "
167649	167662	167663	167663	she	3779	" I was thinking about a mountain in the North of England , "
167666	167677	167663	167663	she	3779	" It 's too silly I wo n't go on . "
167678	167684	167685	167685	he	3780	" We were there together ? "
167689	167696	167697	167697	She	3779	" No . I was alone . "
167712	167719	167708	167708	His	3780	" You 're always alone there ? "
167720	167726	167727	167727	She	3779	" I ca n't explain . "
167738	167765	167727	167727	She	3779	" It 's not a mountain in the North of England . It 's an imagination a story one tells oneself . You have yours too ? "
167766	167785	167708	167708	His	3780	" You 're with me in mine . You 're the thing I make up , you see . "
167786	167792	167793	167793	she	3779	" Oh , I see , "
167796	167805	167793	167793	she	3779	" That 's why it 's so impossible . "
167813	167821	167822	167822	she	3779	" You must try to stop it , "
167825	167830	167831	167831	he	3786	" I wo n't , "
167835	167838	167839	167839	He	3786	" because I "
167968	167976	167977	167977	he	3786	" Because I love you , Katharine , "
168141	168148	168149	168149	he	3786	" You do n't believe me ? "
168164	168183	168184	168184	she	335	" As far as I understand you but what should you advise me to do with this ring ? "
168191	168204	168205	168205	he	3786	" I should advise you to let me keep it for you , "
168218	168239	168205	168205	he	3786	" After what you 've said , I can hardly trust you unless you 'll unsay what you 've said ? "
168240	168252	168304	168304	She	335	" Very well . I 'm not in love with you . "
168253	168270	168271	168271	she	335	" But I think you ARE in love with me .... As I am with you , "
168276	168280	168281	168281	she	335	" At least , "
168292	168303	168281	168281	she	335	" what other word describes the state we 're in ? "
168319	168338	168339	168339	he	3786	" It 's when I 'm with you that I doubt it , not when I 'm alone , "
168342	168347	168348	168348	she	335	" So I thought , "
168385	168395	168396	168396	she	335	" And then you went raving about the streets , "
168399	168445	168446	168446	she	335	" Well , it 's bad enough . But my state is worse than yours , because it has n't anything to do with facts . It 's an hallucination , pure and simple an intoxication .... One can be in love with pure reason ? "
168449	168472	168446	168446	she	335	" Because if you 're in love with a vision , I believe that that 's what I 'm in love with . "
168507	168518	168519	168519	he	158	" Rodney seems to know his own mind well enough , "
168554	168564	168565	168565	she	335	" Cassandra never doubted for a moment . But we "
168576	168585	168565	168565	she	335	" we see each other only now and then "
168586	168592	168565	168565	she	335	" Like lights in a storm "
168593	168601	168602	168602	she	335	" In the midst of a hurricane , "
168724	168734	168735	168735	she	134	" Please do n't let me interrupt you , Mr. "
168758	168769	168770	168770	she	335	" I hope you 've found something nice to read , "
168781	168796	168797	168797	she	335	" Byron ah , Byron . I 've known people who knew Lord Byron , "
168890	168902	168903	168903	Katharine	335	" My dear mother , why are n't you in bed ? "
168923	168930	168903	168903	Katharine	335	" Why are you wandering about ? "
168931	168948	168950	168951	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I 'm sure I should like your poetry better than I like Lord Byron 's , "
168957	168976	168977	168977	Katharine	335	" Mr. Denham does n't write poetry ; he has written articles for father , for the Review , "
168986	168993	168994	168995	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Oh dear ! How dull ! "
169028	169049	169050	169051	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But I 'm sure you read poetry at night . I always judge by the expression of the eyes , "
169054	169061	169062	169062	she	134	" The windows of the soul , "
169066	169076	169077	169077	she	134	" I do n't know much about the law , "
169081	169114	169115	169115	she	134	" though many of my relations were lawyers . Some of them looked very handsome , too , in their wigs . But I think I do know a little about poetry , "
169118	169131	169115	169115	she	134	" And all the things that are n't written down , but but "
169150	169174	169175	169175	she	134	" The night and the stars , the dawn coming up , the barges swimming past , the sun setting .... Ah dear , "
169178	169208	169175	169175	she	134	" well , the sunset is very lovely too . I sometimes think that poetry is n't so much what we write as what we feel , Mr. Denham . "
169376	169388	169389	169389	she	134	" Tell me , shall we ever do without it all ? "
169494	169505	169470	169471	her mother	378	" Please find out the best way of getting there , "
169510	169540	169470	169471	her mother	378	" and wire to dear Sir John Burdett to expect me , with my love . I 've been dreaming all night of you and Shakespeare , dearest Katharine . "
170033	170042	170043	170043	she	335	" Does n't everything look odd this morning ? "
170046	170064	170043	170043	she	335	" Are you really going to spend the morning with those dull old letters , because if so "
170113	170117	170097	170097	Cassandra	335	" History of England "
170166	170174	170126	170127	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I wonder what he was like ? "
170187	170203	170204	170204	Cassandra	335	" Oh , a fraud like the rest of them at least Henry says so , "
170207	170217	170218	170218	she	335	" Though I do n't believe everything Henry says , "
170262	170272	170273	170273	Katharine	335	" Must you read Macaulay 's History , Cassandra ? "
170283	170287	170288	170288	Cassandra	335	" I must , "
170292	170308	170280	170280	her	335	" Well , I 'm going to leave you to look for it by yourself . "
170309	170351	170280	170280	her	335	" Oh , no , Katharine . Please stay and help me . You see you see I told William I 'd read a little every day . And I want to tell him that I 've begun when he comes . "
170352	170358	170359	170359	Katharine	335	" When does William come ? "
170368	170377	170280	170280	her	335	" To tea , if that suits you ? "
170378	170392	170280	170280	her	335	" If it suits me to be out , I suppose you mean . "
170393	170405	170280	170280	her	335	" Oh , you 're horrid .... Why should n't you ? "
170406	170409	170280	170280	her	335	" Yes ? "
170410	170419	170280	170280	her	335	" Why should n't you be happy too ? "
170420	170426	170427	170427	Katharine	335	" I am quite happy , "
170430	170439	170440	170440	she	335	" I mean as I am . Katharine , "
170444	170455	170440	170440	she	335	" do let 's be married on the same day . "
170456	170462	170280	170280	her	335	" To the same man ? "
170463	170480	170440	170440	she	335	" Oh , no , no . But why should n't you marry some one else ? "
170481	170487	170489	170489	Katharine	335	" Here 's your Macaulay , "
170500	170523	170489	170489	Katharine	335	" I should say you 'd better begin to read at once if you mean to be educated by tea - time . "
170524	170529	170531	170531	Cassandra	335	" Damn Lord Macaulay ! "
170540	170547	170531	170531	Cassandra	335	" Would you rather not talk ? "
170548	170555	170556	170556	Katharine	335	" We 've talked enough already , "
170560	170573	170575	170575	Cassandra	335	" I know I sha n't be able to settle to Macaulay , "
170615	170621	170622	170622	she	335	" Have YOU read Macaulay ? "
170625	170635	170637	170637	she	335	" No . William never tried to educate me . "
170690	170696	170697	170697	she	335	" We were n't serious , "
170701	170708	170710	170710	Cassandra	335	" But I 'm fearfully serious , "
170908	170913	170914	170914	she	335	" Was that him ? "
170917	170923	170924	170924	Katharine	335	" It was Ralph Denham , "
170927	170933	170975	170975	She	335	" I meant Ralph Denham . "
170934	170951	170975	170975	She	335	" Why did you mean Ralph Denham ? What has William told you about Ralph Denham ? "
170985	170998	170999	170999	she	335	" Now , when are you and William going to be married ? "
171135	171215	171120	171120	Cassandra	335	" ... a thousand pities ahem I fear we shall cause a great deal of natural annoyance . If , on the other hand , what I have reason to think will happen , should happen within reasonable time , and the present position is not in any way offensive to you , delay would , in my opinion , serve all our interests better than a premature explanation , which is bound to cause more surprise than is desirable "
171216	171221	171222	171222	Katharine	335	" Very like William , "
171243	171250	171251	171251	Cassandra	335	" I quite understand his feelings , "
171254	171285	171251	171251	Cassandra	335	" I quite agree with them . I think it would be much better , if you intend to marry Mr. Denham , that we should wait as William says . "
171286	171307	171308	171308	Cassandra	335	" But , then , if I do n't marry him for months or , perhaps , not at all ? "
171376	171391	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" I 'm Ralph Denham speaking . I 'm in my right senses now . "
171392	171402	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" How long did you wait outside the house ? "
171403	171418	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" I went home and wrote you a letter . I tore it up . "
171419	171427	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" I shall tear up everything too . "
171428	171433	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" I shall come . "
171434	171442	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" Yes . Come to - day . "
171443	171449	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" I must explain to you "
171450	171456	171462	171462	Ralph	158	" Yes . We must explain "
171474	171477	171468	171468	he	158	" Nothing . "
171619	171656	171609	171609	She	335	" If you do n't want to tell people yourselves , I 'll do it for you . I know William has feelings about these matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything . "
171657	171669	171671	171671	Cassandra	335	" Because he 's fearfully sensitive about other people 's feelings , "
171673	171692	171671	171671	Cassandra	335	" The idea that he could upset Aunt Maggie or Uncle Trevor would make him ill for weeks . "
171722	171729	171730	171730	she	335	" Yes , you 're right , "
171733	171775	171697	171697	she	335	" And then he worships beauty . He wants life to be beautiful in every part of it . Have you ever noticed how exquisitely he finishes everything ? Look at the address on that envelope . Every letter is perfect . "
171838	171841	171842	171842	she	335	" Yes , "
171845	171850	171842	171842	she	335	" he loves beauty . "
171851	171862	171864	171864	Cassandra	335	" I hope we shall have a great many children , "
171866	171871	171864	171864	Cassandra	335	" He loves children . "
172000	172005	171996	171996	Cassandra	335	" History of England . "
172168	172176	172162	172162	Cassandra	335	" How like Aunt Maggie you look ! "
172177	172180	172182	172182	Katharine	335	" Nonsense , "
172713	172720	172666	172666	He	174	" Has Katharine spoken to you ? "
172721	172746	172747	172747	William	174	" Yes . But she says she 's not engaged . She does n't seem to think she 's ever going to be engaged . "
172754	172773	172774	172774	Cassandra	335	" They telephoned this morning , and she behaves very oddly . She forgets to help the pudding , "
172782	172813	172774	172774	Cassandra	335	" My dear child , after what I saw and heard last night , it 's not a question of guessing or suspecting . Either she 's engaged to him or "
172902	172912	172899	172899	Cassandra	335	" Do n't you think everything looks quite different ? "
172913	172920	172921	172921	he	174	" You 've moved the sofa ? "
172924	172932	172934	172934	Katharine	335	" No . Nothing 's been touched , "
172936	172943	172934	172934	Katharine	335	" Everything 's exactly the same . "
173117	173126	173109	173109	she	335	" Then I 'm afraid I must go . "
173147	173154	173155	173155	Cassandra	335	" Well , she IS queer ! "
173201	173213	173214	173214	she	335	" If I 'm late , do n't wait for me , "
173217	173223	173214	173214	she	335	" I shall have dined , "
173232	173237	173238	173238	William	174	" But she ca n't "
173246	173259	173238	173238	William	174	" not without any gloves and bread and butter in her hand ! "
173282	173292	173293	173293	Cassandra	335	" She must have gone to meet Mr. Denham , "
173296	173300	173301	173301	William	174	" Goodness knows ! "
173326	173337	173339	173339	Cassandra	335	" It 's the sort of way Aunt Maggie behaves , "
173362	173371	173372	173372	he	174	" This is what I 've been foretelling , "
173376	173412	173372	173372	he	174	" Once set the ordinary conventions aside Thank Heaven Mrs. Hilbery is away . But there 's Mr. Hilbery . How are we to explain it to him ? I shall have to leave you . "
173413	173426	173427	173427	Cassandra	335	" But Uncle Trevor wo n't be back for hours , William ! "
173430	173483	173372	173372	he	174	" You never can tell . He may be on his way already . Or suppose Mrs. Milvain your Aunt Celia or Mrs. Cosham , or any other of your aunts or uncles should be shown in and find us alone together . You know what they 're saying about us already . "
173505	173510	173511	173511	she	335	" We might hide , "
173527	173537	173539	173539	William	174	" I refuse entirely to get under the table , "
173724	173730	173713	173713	William	174	" unless it bored her ? "
174808	174831	174795	174795	she	335	" I came to meet you and I have missed you . I could not face William and Cassandra . They want us "
174836	174844	174845	174845	she	335	" They insist that we are engaged , "
174848	174863	174845	174845	she	335	" and we could n't talk at all , or explain anything . I want "
174924	174933	174934	174934	she	335	" ... to say all kinds of things , "
175883	175888	175889	175889	Katharine	335	" Yes , yes , "
175905	175911	175889	175889	Katharine	335	" Have you had tea ? "
175912	175916	175917	175917	she	335	" Oh yes , "
175965	175983	175954	175954	Katharine	335	" Do n't light the fire for me .... I want to know Ralph Denham 's address . "
176004	176015	176016	176016	Mary	345	" The Apple Orchard , Mount Ararat Road , Highgate , "
176025	176032	176033	176033	Katharine	335	" Oh , I remember now ! "
176043	176056	176057	176057	She	335	" I suppose it would n't take twenty minutes to drive there ? "
176070	176078	176080	176080	Mary	345	" But you wo n't find him , "
176106	176113	176114	176114	she	335	" Why ? Where is he ? "
176117	176126	176090	176090	Katharine	335	" He wo n't have left his office . "
176127	176135	176136	176136	she	335	" But he has left the office , "
176139	176187	176136	176136	she	335	" The only question is will he have reached home yet ? He went to see me at Chelsea ; I tried to meet him and missed him . He will have found no message to explain . So I must find him as soon as possible . "
176197	176203	176204	176204	she	335	" But why not telephone ? "
176224	176236	176237	176237	she	335	" Of course ! Why did n't I think of that ! "
176314	176320	176399	176399	she	335	" Has Mr. Denham called ? "
176321	176326	176399	176399	she	335	" Yes , miss . "
176327	176334	176399	176399	she	335	" Did he ask for me ? "
176335	176346	176399	176399	she	335	" Yes . We said you were out , miss . "
176347	176354	176399	176399	she	335	" Did he leave any message ? "
176355	176369	176399	176399	she	335	" No . He went away . About twenty minutes ago , miss . "
176408	176411	176399	176399	she	335	" Mary . "
176429	176432	176433	176433	she	335	" Yes , "
176436	176444	176433	176433	she	335	" I sha n't be a moment . "
176590	176599	176581	176581	She	335	" Well , did you get an answer ? "
176600	176607	176608	176608	Katharine	335	" He has left Chelsea already , "
176611	176621	176623	176623	Mary	345	" Still , he wo n't be home yet , "
176650	176664	176665	176665	Mary	345	" I 'll ring up his home and ask whether he 's back . "
176681	176694	176665	176665	Mary	345	" No . His sister says he has n't come back yet . "
176695	176698	176699	176699	She	335	" Ah ! "
176709	176724	176699	176699	She	335	" They 've had a message . He wo n't be back to dinner . "
176725	176734	176740	176740	her	335	" Then what is he going to do ? "
176792	176799	176788	176788	Mary	345	" I really do n't know . "
176840	176847	176848	176848	Mary	345	" Possibly he may come here , "
176860	176879	176880	176880	She	335	" It would be worth your while to wait if you want to see him to - night . "
176904	176912	176913	176913	she	335	" I 'll wait half an hour , "
177053	177061	177063	177063	Katharine	335	" What would be the time now ? "
177076	177085	177087	177087	Mary	345	" I 'm going to get dinner ready , "
177094	177100	177102	177102	Katharine	335	" Then I 'll go , "
177104	177116	177127	177127	her	335	" Why do n't you stay ? Where are you going ? "
177130	177137	177138	177138	she	335	" Perhaps I might find him , "
177141	177155	177117	177117	Katharine	335	" But why should it matter ? You 'll see him another day . "
177167	177175	177176	177176	Katharine	335	" I was wrong to come here , "
177189	177199	177200	177200	Mary	345	" You had a perfect right to come here , "
177238	177248	177249	177249	Mary	345	" Of course you had a right to come , "
177259	177262	177264	177264	Katharine	335	" No , "
177266	177315	177264	177264	Katharine	335	" Except that when one 's desperate one has a sort of right . I am desperate . How do I know what 's happening to him now ? He may do anything . He may wander about the streets all night . Anything may happen to him . "
177331	177342	177343	177343	she	335	" You know you exaggerate ; you 're talking nonsense , "
177347	177357	177316	177316	She	335	" Mary , I must talk I must tell you "
177358	177366	177367	177367	Mary	345	" You need n't tell me anything , "
177371	177379	177367	177367	Mary	345	" Ca n't I see for myself ? "
177380	177385	177386	177386	Katharine	335	" No , no , "
177389	177394	177386	177386	Katharine	335	" It 's not that "
177471	177491	177468	177468	she	335	" You forget that I loved him too . I thought I knew him . I DID know him . "
177644	177652	177653	177653	she	335	" There are different ways of loving , "
177682	177695	177696	177696	she	335	" Perhaps he 's waiting in the street again to - night , "
177699	177710	177696	177696	she	335	" I 'll go now . I might find him . "
177711	177723	177725	177725	Mary	345	" It 's far more likely that he 'll come here , "
177738	177747	177728	177728	Katharine	335	" I 'll wait another half - hour . "
178086	178094	178095	178095	Mary	345	" But where are you going to ? "
178104	178117	178129	178129	her	335	" Oh , I 'm going home no , to Highgate perhaps . "
178472	178480	178481	178481	Mary	345	" Look here where are you going ? "
178490	178500	178501	178501	She	335	" We must take that cab and go home . "
178528	178532	178533	178533	she	335	" Very well , "
178536	178547	178533	178533	she	335	" We may as well go there as anywhere else . "
178589	178598	178599	178599	she	335	" I 'm sure we shall find him , "
178609	178616	178617	178617	Katharine	335	" It may be too late , "
178635	178638	178639	178639	she	335	" Nonsense , "
178649	178664	178639	178639	she	335	" If we do n't find him there we shall find him somewhere else . "
178665	178679	178711	178711	herself	335	" But suppose he 's walking about the streets for hours and hours ? "
178690	178701	178702	178702	she	335	" He may refuse ever to speak to me again , "
178763	178769	178770	178770	she	335	" Do n't be frightened , "
178778	178799	178770	178770	she	335	" I 'm not going to jump out of the cab . It would n't do much good after all . "
178809	178816	178817	178817	Katharine	335	" I ought to have apologized , "
178824	178945	178946	178946	She	3997	" for bringing you into all this business ; I have n't told you half , either . I 'm no longer engaged to William Rodney . He is to marry Cassandra Otway . It 's all arranged all perfectly right .... And after he 'd waited in the streets for hours and hours , William made me bring him in . He was standing under the lamp - post watching our windows . He was perfectly white when he came into the room . William left us alone , and we sat and talked . It seems ages and ages ago , now . Was it last night ? Have I been out long ? What 's the time ? "
178969	178976	178977	178977	she	3997	" Only half - past eight ! "
178980	178988	178989	178989	She	3997	" Then he may be there still . "
179003	179028	178989	178989	She	3997	" But if he 's not there , what shall I do ? Where could I find him ? The streets are so crowded . "
179029	179035	179036	179036	Mary	345	" We shall find him , "
179412	179416	179417	179417	Katharine	335	" At last , "
179479	179497	179473	179474	the maid	519	" Mr. Denham called again , miss . He has been waiting for you for some time . "
180016	180053	180054	180054	he	180	" That does n't matter with me , of course , but suppose it happened with somebody else ? What would they think ? They would suspect something merely from her expression . She looked she looked "
180056	180065	180054	180054	he	180	" like some one walking in her sleep . "
180109	180115	180116	180116	he	180	" Once throw conventions aside , "
180119	180129	180116	180116	he	180	" once do the things that people do n't do "
180460	180469	180470	180470	she	335	" We 're not going to interrupt you , "
180648	180660	180661	180661	he	180	" But do n't you think it 's a little unsociable ? "
180664	180688	180661	180661	he	180	" Why not do something amusing ? go to the play , for instance ? Why not ask Katharine and Ralph , eh ? "
180706	180715	180716	180716	she	335	" Do n't you think they must be ? "
180726	180749	180720	180720	William	180	" Oh , I know nothing about that . I only thought we might amuse ourselves , as your uncle 's out . "
181355	181361	181362	181363	the musicians	4060	" God Save the King , "
181809	181813	181806	181806	she	335	" How can Cassandra "
181830	181840	181806	181806	she	335	" how could she herself have been so blind ? "
182033	182048	182049	182049	she	335	" She looks as if she were offering up a sacrifice ! Very beautiful , "
182263	182270	182272	182272	Katharine	335	" The only hope for us , "
182274	182295	182272	182272	Katharine	335	" is that William shall die , and Cassandra shall be given rooms as the widow of a distinguished poet . "
182296	182298	182299	182299	Cassandra	335	" Or "
182445	182457	182401	182401	Katharine	335	" We have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish ... "
182460	182470	182401	182401	Katharine	335	" We must leave time to visit the Maze . "
183051	183058	183059	183059	he	138	" Katharine is out this afternoon , "
183062	183079	183059	183059	he	138	" Why not come round later and discuss it with her with us both , eh ? "
183080	183101	183139	183139	his	138	" My dear Trevor , I have particular reasons for wishing to talk to you alone .... Where is Katharine ? "
183102	183133	183134	183134	He	138	" She 's out with her young man , naturally . Cassandra plays the part of chaperone very usefully . A charming young woman that a great favorite of mine . "
183171	183175	183176	183177	Mrs. Milvain	222	" With Cassandra , "
183181	183185	183176	183177	Mrs. Milvain	222	" With Cassandra . "
183186	183192	183193	183194	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Yes , with Cassandra , "
183203	183248	183193	183194	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I think they said they were going to Hampton Court , and I rather believe they were taking a protege of mine , Ralph Denham , a very clever fellow , too , to amuse Cassandra . I thought the arrangement very suitable . "
183276	183338	183339	183340	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Hampton Court always seems to me an ideal spot for engaged couples . There 's the Maze , there 's a nice place for having tea I forget what they call it and then , if the young man knows his business he contrives to take his lady upon the river . Full of possibilities full . Cake , Celia ? "
183343	183374	183339	183340	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I respect my dinner too much , but that ca n't possibly apply to you . You 've never observed that feast , so far as I can remember . "
183404	183411	183412	183412	she	222	" Who is this Mr. Denham ? "
183415	183419	183421	183422	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Ralph Denham ? "
183434	183478	183421	183422	Mr. Hilbery	138	" A very interesting young man . I 've a great belief in him . He 's an authority upon our mediaeval institutions , and if he were n't forced to earn his living he would write a book that very much wants writing "
183479	183488	183489	183490	Mrs. Milvain	222	" He is not well off , then ? "
183493	183513	183421	183422	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Has n't a penny , I 'm afraid , and a family more or less dependent on him . "
183514	183525	183421	183422	Mr. Hilbery	138	" A mother and sisters ? His father is dead ? "
183526	183536	183538	183539	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Yes , his father died some years ago , "
183580	183598	183620	183621	Mr. Hilbery	138	" His father has been dead some time , and this young man had to take his place "
183599	183604	183605	183606	Mrs. Milvain	222	" A legal family ? "
183609	183619	183605	183606	Mrs. Milvain	222	" I fancy I 've seen the name somewhere . "
183626	183643	183644	183644	he	138	" I should be inclined to doubt whether they were altogether in that walk of life , "
183647	183692	183693	183693	he	138	" I fancy that Denham once told me that his father was a corn merchant . Perhaps he said a stockbroker . He came to grief , anyhow , as stockbrokers have a way of doing . I 've a great respect for Denham , "
183729	183740	183741	183741	he	138	" Cassandra 's grown into a very charming young woman , "
183745	183771	183741	183741	he	138	" Charming to look at , and charming to talk to , though her historical knowledge is not altogether profound . Another cup of tea ? "
183799	183809	183810	183810	she	222	" It is Cassandra that I have come about , "
183813	183872	183810	183810	she	222	" I am very sorry to say that Cassandra is not at all what you think her , Trevor . She has imposed upon your and Maggie 's goodness . She has behaved in a way that would have seemed incredible in this house of all houses were it not for other circumstances that are still more incredible . "
183886	183893	183894	183894	he	138	" It all sounds very black , "
183907	183918	183894	183894	he	138	" But I own I am completely in the dark . "
183936	184021	183919	183920	Mrs. Milvain	222	" Who has Cassandra gone out with ? William Rodney . Who has Katharine gone out with ? Ralph Denham . Why are they for ever meeting each other round street corners , and going to music - halls , and taking cabs late at night ? Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when I question her ? I understand the reason now . Katharine has entangled herself with this unknown lawyer ; she has seen fit to condone Cassandra 's conduct . "
184028	184044	184045	184046	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Ah , well , Katharine will no doubt have some explanation to give me , "
184050	184090	184045	184046	Mr. Hilbery	138	" It 's a little too complicated for me to take in all at once , I confess and , if you wo n't think me rude , Celia , I think I 'll be getting along towards Knightsbridge . "
184097	184111	184112	184112	she	222	" She has condoned Cassandra 's conduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham , "
184299	184313	184283	184283	he	578	" She has condoned Cassandra 's conduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham . "
184549	184676	184696	184696	she	335	" I 'm sorry to bother you , my dear . I heard you come in , and thought I 'd better make myself disagreeable at once as it seems , unfortunately , that fathers are expected to make themselves disagreeable . Now , your Aunt Celia has been to see me ; your Aunt Celia has taken it into her head apparently that you and Cassandra have been let us say a little foolish . This going about together these pleasant little parties there 's been some kind of misunderstanding . I told her I saw no harm in it , but I should just like to hear from yourself . Has Cassandra been left a little too much in the company of Mr. Denham ? "
184704	184728	184696	184696	she	335	" I do n't see why I should answer Aunt Celia 's questions . I 've told her already that I wo n't . "
184752	184830	184879	184879	she	4142	" Very good . Then you authorize me to tell her that she 's been mistaken , and there was nothing but a little fun in it ? You 've no doubt , Katharine , in your own mind ? Cassandra is in our charge , and I do n't intend that people should gossip about her . I suggest that you should be a little more careful in future . Invite me to your next entertainment . "
184884	184891	184892	184892	he	138	" Have you a guilty conscience ? "
184896	184902	184903	184903	he	138	" Tell me , Katharine , "
184918	184930	184931	184931	she	4142	" I 've been meaning to tell you for some time , "
184934	184943	184931	184931	she	4142	" I 'm not going to marry William . "
184944	184950	184951	184951	he	138	" You 're not going ! "
184962	184972	184951	184951	he	138	" Why ? When ? Explain yourself , Katharine . "
184973	184985	184986	184986	Katharine	335	" Oh , some time ago a week , perhaps more . "
185003	185023	184951	184951	he	138	" But may I ask why have I not been told of this what do you mean by it ? "
185024	185036	184986	184986	Katharine	335	" We do n't wish to be married that 's all . "
185037	185048	184951	184951	he	138	" This is William 's wish as well as yours ? "
185049	185058	184986	184986	Katharine	335	" Oh , yes . We agree perfectly . "
185177	185200	185201	185201	he	138	" I confess I find great difficulty in following you . I should like to hear William 's side of the story , "
185205	185220	185201	185201	he	138	" I think he ought to have spoken to me in the first instance . "
185221	185228	185230	185230	Katharine	335	" I would n't let him , "
185232	185243	185244	185244	she	335	" I know it must seem to you very strange , "
185247	185264	185244	185244	she	335	" But I assure you , if you 'd wait a little until mother comes back . "
185409	185414	185415	185415	Katharine	335	" Here 's William , "
185424	185434	185435	185435	she	335	" I 've told father we 're not engaged , "
185440	185452	185435	185435	she	335	" I 've explained that I prevented you from telling him . "
185531	185551	185512	185512	He	138	" I should like your account of this affair , Rodney if Katharine no longer prevents you from speaking . "
185559	185567	185568	185568	he	180	" Our engagement is at an end , "
185576	185587	185512	185512	He	138	" Has this been arrived at by your joint desire ? "
185607	185612	185598	185598	Katharine	335	" Oh , yes . "
185633	185663	185664	185664	he	138	" I can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until the effect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off . You have now known each other "
185667	185674	185675	185675	Katharine	335	" There 's been no misunderstanding , "
185678	185683	185684	185684	She	335	" Nothing at all . "
185839	185852	185853	185853	he	404	" Look here , we must get to the bottom of this , "
185870	185950	185853	185853	he	404	" You 've had some difference of opinion , eh ? Take my word for it , most people go through this sort of thing when they 're engaged . I 've seen more trouble come from long engagements than from any other form of human folly . Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your minds both of you . I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion . Visit some cheerful seaside resort , Rodney . "
186152	186157	186141	186141	He	138	" I love Cassandra . "
186206	186211	186212	186213	Mr. Hilbery	138	" You have the impudence "
186263	186267	186268	186268	she	4775	" Uncle Trevor , "
186271	186280	186281	186281	She	4775	" I insist upon telling you the truth ! "
186333	186340	186341	186341	she	4775	" You must know the truth , "
186348	186362	186363	186364	Mr. Hilbery	138	" You have the impudence to tell me this in Katharine 's presence ? "
186376	186383	186384	186384	Rodney	180	" I am aware , quite aware "
186415	186427	186428	186428	he	180	" I am quite aware what you must think of me , "
186444	186460	186461	186462	Mr. Hilbery	138	" I could express my views on the subject more fully if we were alone , "
186465	186471	186473	186473	Katharine	335	" But you forget me , "
186501	186525	186483	186483	her	335	" I think William has behaved perfectly rightly , and , after all , it is I who am concerned I and Cassandra . "
186585	186643	186644	186644	He	138	" Cassandra and Rodney have a perfect right to settle their own affairs according to their own wishes ; but I see no reason why they should do so either in my room or in my house .... I wish to be quite clear on this point , however ; you are no longer engaged to Rodney . "
186732	186735	186736	186737	Mr. Hilbery	138	" Wait , "
186740	186749	186750	186750	he	138	" I wish to speak to you alone , "
186761	186767	186768	186768	she	335	" I 'll come back , "
186862	186866	186867	186867	Cassandra	335	" Uncle Trevor , "
186871	186893	186867	186867	Cassandra	335	" do n't be angry , please . I could n't help it ; I do beg you to forgive me . "
186916	186926	186927	186927	he	2070	" I suppose you have communicated with the Otways , "
186933	186943	186944	186944	Cassandra	335	" Uncle Trevor , we wanted to tell you , "
186949	186952	186953	186953	she	335	" We waited "
186967	186976	186977	186978	her uncle	2070	" Yes ? What were you waiting for ? "
187030	187041	187042	187042	he	2070	" This is a most unpleasant business for all parties , "
187076	187084	187085	187085	he	2070	" Why do n't you sit down ? "
187124	187136	187137	187137	he	180	" I think Cassandra can explain matters better in my absence , "
187240	187255	187232	187232	Denham	135	" Anyhow , there 's no reason why we should n't see each other . "
187256	187272	187273	187273	Katharine	335	" Or stay together . It 's only marriage that 's out of the question , "
187276	187290	187232	187232	Denham	135	" But if I find myself coming to want you more and more ? "
187291	187301	187232	187232	Denham	135	" If our lapses come more and more often ? "
187313	187318	187319	187319	he	135	" But at least , "
187322	187351	187352	187352	he	135	" we 've established the fact that my lapses are still in some odd way connected with you ; yours have nothing to do with me . Katharine , "
187365	187441	187352	187352	he	135	" I assure you that we are in love what other people call love . Remember that night . We had no doubts whatever then . We were absolutely happy for half an hour . You had no lapse until the day after ; I had no lapse until yesterday morning . We 've been happy at intervals all day until I went off my head , and you , quite naturally , were bored . "
187442	187445	187446	187446	she	4188	" Ah , "
187456	187476	187477	187477	she	4188	" I ca n't make you understand . It 's not boredom I 'm never bored . Reality reality , "
187500	187551	187477	187477	she	4188	" I cease to be real to you . It 's the faces in a storm again the vision in a hurricane . We come together for a moment and we part . It 's my fault , too . I 'm as bad as you are worse , perhaps . "
187582	187584	187552	187552	They	4189	" lapses "
188284	188289	188290	188290	he	158	" Now , Katharine , "
188303	188314	188290	188290	he	158	" you will , perhaps , have the kindness to explain "
188319	188329	188330	188330	he	158	" What inferences do you expect me to draw ? "
188334	188372	188373	188373	he	158	" You tell me that you are not engaged to Rodney ; I see you on what appear to be extremely intimate terms with another with Ralph Denham . What am I to conclude ? Are you , "
188382	188388	188373	188373	he	158	" engaged to Ralph Denham ? "
188389	188392	188393	188393	she	335	" No , "
188437	188481	188482	188482	he	158	" Then all I can say is that you 've very strange ideas of the proper way to behave .... People have drawn certain conclusions , nor am I surprised .... The more I think of it the more inexplicable I find it , "
188493	188585	188586	188586	He	4205	" Why am I left in ignorance of what is going on in my own house ? Why am I left to hear of these events for the first time from my sister ? Most disagreeable most upsetting . How I 'm to explain to your Uncle Francis but I wash my hands of it . Cassandra goes tomorrow . I forbid Rodney the house . As for the other young man , the sooner he makes himself scarce the better . After placing the most implicit trust in you , Katharine "
188705	188712	188713	188713	he	4205	" I 'll speak to Denham , "
188729	188736	188737	188737	Katharine	335	" I shall come with you , "
188744	188750	188752	188753	her father	404	" You will stay here , "
188755	188765	188766	188766	she	335	" What are you going to say to him ? "
188769	188783	188784	188784	he	4205	" I suppose I may say what I like in my own house ? "
188787	188794	188795	188795	she	335	" Then I go , too , "
188843	188857	188858	188858	he	138	" I understood you to say that you were not engaged to him , "
188870	188876	188877	188877	she	335	" We are not engaged , "
188880	188915	188916	188916	he	138	" It should be a matter of indifference to you , then , whether he comes here or not I will not have you listening to other things when I am speaking to you ! "
188932	188946	188916	188916	he	138	" Answer me frankly , what is your relationship with this young man ? "
188947	188958	188959	188959	she	335	" Nothing that I can explain to a third person , "
188963	188973	188974	188974	he	138	" I will have no more of these equivocations , "
188977	188983	188984	188984	she	335	" I refuse to explain , "
188998	189001	189002	189002	she	335	" There ! "
189005	189010	189002	189002	she	335	" He is gone ! "
189033	189044	189045	189045	he	138	" For God 's sake , Katharine , control yourself ! "
189113	189123	189124	189124	he	138	" These emotions have been very upsetting , naturally , "
189146	189219	189136	189136	he	138	" You 've been placed in a very difficult position , as I understand from Cassandra . Now let us come to terms ; we will leave these agitating questions in peace for the present . Meanwhile , let us try to behave like civilized beings . Let us read Sir Walter Scott . What d'you say to ' The Antiquary , ' eh ? Or ' The Bride of Lammermoor ' ? "
190077	190083	190085	190086	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" From Shakespeare 's tomb ! "
190119	190125	190126	190126	she	134	" Thank God , Katharine ! "
190129	190133	190134	190134	she	134	" Thank God ! "
190137	190143	190145	190145	Katharine	335	" You 've come back ? "
190211	190219	190220	190221	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Nothing else matters in the world ! "
190224	190275	190220	190221	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Names are n't everything ; it 's what we feel that 's everything . I did n't want silly , kind , interfering letters . I did n't want your father to tell me . I knew it from the first . I prayed that it might be so . "
190276	190281	190282	190282	Katharine	335	" You knew it ? "
190296	190303	190304	190304	She	335	" How did you know it ? "
190322	190359	190304	190304	She	335	" The first evening you told me , Katharine . Oh , and thousands of times dinner - parties talking about books the way he came into the room your voice when you spoke of him . "
190375	190389	190371	190371	she	335	" I 'm not going to marry William . And then there 's Cassandra "
190390	190397	190399	190400	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Yes , there 's Cassandra , "
190402	190431	190432	190432	she	134	" I own I was a little grudging at first , but , after all , she plays the piano so beautifully . Do tell me , Katharine , "
190436	190454	190432	190432	she	134	" where did you go that evening she played Mozart , and you thought I was asleep ? "
190460	190466	190467	190467	she	335	" To Mary Datchet 's , "
190470	190473	190475	190476	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Ah ! "
190488	190498	190475	190476	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I had my little romance my little speculation . "
190529	190539	190540	190540	she	335	" I 'm not in love with Ralph Denham , "
190543	190553	190555	190556	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Do n't marry unless you 're in love ! "
190560	190563	190564	190564	she	134	" But , "
190573	190583	190564	190564	she	134	" are n't there different ways , Katharine different ? "
190584	190600	190601	190601	Katharine	335	" We want to meet as often as we like , but to be free , "
190604	190621	190622	190623	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" To meet here , to meet in his house , to meet in the street . "
190665	190668	190663	190663	she	134	" kind letters "
190680	190691	190692	190692	Katharine	335	" Yes . Or to stay away in the country , "
190709	190734	190695	190696	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" What a comfort he was in that shop how he took me and found the ruins at once how SAFE I felt with him "
190735	190792	190831	190832	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Safe ? Oh , no , he 's fearfully rash he 's always taking risks . He wants to throw up his profession and live in a little cottage and write books , though he has n't a penny of his own , and there are any number of sisters and brothers dependent on him . "
190793	190801	190802	190803	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Ah , he has a mother ? "
190806	190821	190822	190822	Katharine	335	" Yes . Rather a fine - looking old lady , with white hair . "
190887	190902	190903	190903	she	335	" A wretched old bird in a corner , with half its feathers out , "
190942	190952	190935	190936	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But , Katharine , you ARE in love ! "
191185	191220	191177	191177	She	134	" It 's all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays , if you think the Church service a little florid which it is , though there are noble things in it . "
191221	191231	191232	191232	Katharine	335	" But we do n't want to be married , "
191239	191257	191232	191232	Katharine	335	" Why , after all , is n't it perfectly possible to live together without being married ? "
191299	191329	191294	191294	herself	134	" A plus B minus C equals ' x y z ' . It 's so dreadfully ugly , Katharine . That 's what I feel so dreadfully ugly . "
191365	191375	191376	191376	she	335	" Well , I do n't know about ugliness , "
191381	191391	191392	191393	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But he does n't ask it of you ? "
191396	191408	191392	191393	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Not that grave young man with the steady brown eyes ? "
191409	191422	191450	191451	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" He does n't ask anything we neither of us ask anything . "
191423	191439	191392	191393	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" If I could help you , Katharine , by the memory of what I felt "
191440	191449	191450	191451	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Yes , tell me what you felt . "
191498	191513	191514	191514	she	134	" We were in a little boat going out to a ship at night , "
191517	191588	191514	191514	she	134	" The sun had set and the moon was rising over our heads . There were lovely silver lights upon the waves and three green lights upon the steamer in the middle of the bay . Your father 's head looked so grand against the mast . It was life , it was death . The great sea was round us . It was the voyage for ever and ever . "
191695	191699	191705	191705	her	134	" Who knows , "
191708	191740	191741	191741	she	134	" where we are bound for , or why , or who has sent us , or what we shall find who knows anything , except that love is our faith love "
191822	191838	191809	191810	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" And you wo n't think those ugly thoughts again , will you , Katharine ? "
191907	191911	191912	191912	she	134	" But then , "
191922	191938	191939	191939	she	134	" you knew you were in love ; but we 're different . It seems , "
191954	192074	192075	192075	she	134	" as if something came to an end suddenly gave out faded an illusion as if when we think we 're in love we make it up we imagine what does n't exist . That 's why it 's impossible that we should ever marry . Always to be finding the other an illusion , and going off and forgetting about them , never to be certain that you cared , or that he was n't caring for some one not you at all , the horror of changing from one state to the other , being happy one moment and miserable the next that 's the reason why we ca n't possibly marry . At the same time , "
192078	192088	192075	192075	she	134	" we ca n't live without each other , because "
192111	192121	192122	192123	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" We have to have faith in our vision , "
192148	192154	192155	192155	She	134	" otherwise , as you say "
192176	192197	192198	192198	she	134	" Believe me , Katharine , it 's the same for every one for me , too for your father , "
192227	192242	192220	192220	she	335	" But where is Ralph ? Why is n't he here to see me ? "
192249	192259	192260	192260	she	335	" Because he 's not allowed to come here , "
192270	192282	192283	192283	she	134	" Would there be time to send for him before luncheon ? "
192360	192368	192369	192369	she	335	" I 'm not happy without him , "
193369	193384	193385	193385	she	3411	" I hope you 're not disposing of somebody 's fortune in a hurry , "
193396	193618	193385	193385	she	3411	" or cutting off an entail at one blow , because I want to ask you to do me a favor . And Anderson wo n't keep his horse waiting . Anderson is a perfect tyrant , but he drove my dear father to the Abbey the day they buried him . I made bold to come to you , Mr. Denham , not exactly in search of legal assistance though I do n't know who I 'd rather come to , if I were in trouble , but in order to ask your help in settling some tiresome little domestic affairs that have arisen in my absence . I 've been to Stratford - on - Avon I must tell you all about that one of these days , and there I got a letter from my sister - in - law , a dear kind goose who likes interfering with other people 's children because she 's got none of her own . We 're dreadfully afraid that she 's going to lose the sight of one of her eyes , and I always feel that our physical ailments are so apt to turn into mental ailments . I think Matthew Arnold says something of the same kind about Lord Byron . But that 's neither here nor there . "
193676	193688	193689	193690	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" I did n't come here to talk about Lord Byron , "
193698	193722	193723	193723	She	134	" though I know that both you and Katharine , unlike other young people of your generation , still find him worth reading . "
193726	193741	193742	193742	she	134	" I 'm so glad you 've made Katharine read poetry , Mr. Denham ! "
193745	193769	193742	193742	she	134	" and feel poetry , and look poetry ! She ca n't talk it yet , but she will oh , she will ! "
193812	193819	193820	193821	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" But you care for her ? "
193824	193828	193829	193829	he	158	" Good God ! "
193841	193854	193855	193856	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" It 's the Church of England service you both object to ? "
193860	193872	193873	193873	Ralph	158	" I do n't care a damn what service it is , "
193876	193892	193893	193894	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" You would marry her in Westminster Abbey if the worst came to the worst ? "
193897	193908	193909	193909	Ralph	158	" I would marry her in St. Paul 's Cathedral , "
193985	193989	193991	193992	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Thank God ! "
194273	194277	194278	194278	she	134	" Never mind , "
194281	194322	194278	194278	she	134	" we 'll go to St. Paul 's another day , and it may turn out , though I ca n't promise that it WILL , that he 'll take us past Westminster Abbey , which would be even better . "
194507	194517	194518	194518	she	134	" There 's plenty of room for us all , "
194522	194538	194539	194539	she	134	" Plenty of room . We could find space for FOUR of you , William , "
194703	194706	194707	194707	she	134	" Now , "
194716	194721	194707	194707	she	134	" here we are ! "
194776	194785	194765	194765	Rodney	180	" You go in , Denham . I ... "
194861	194864	194865	194865	she	134	" Ah , "
194868	194902	194903	194903	she	134	" Katharine 's not here . She must be upstairs in her room . You have something to say to her , I know , Mr. Denham . You can find your way ? "
195016	195022	195023	195023	he	4361	" May I come in ? "
195031	195034	195035	195035	He	4361	" Yes . "
195152	195161	195162	195162	she	335	" Do n't move , do n't go , "
195256	195269	195271	195271	Ralph	158	" Those were the papers you left on the seat at Kew , "
195275	195290	195271	195271	Ralph	158	" You folded them so quickly that I could n't see what they were . "
195507	195519	195520	195520	she	335	" I like your little dot with the flames round it , "
195724	195737	195712	195712	She	335	" Yes , the world looks something like that to me too . "
196005	196008	196003	196003	he	158	" Cassandra ! "
196040	196048	196049	196049	she	133	" Nobody must know I 'm here , "
196056	196086	196049	196049	she	133	" I missed my train . I have been wandering about London all day . I can bear it no longer . Katharine , what am I to do ? "
196115	196120	196122	196122	Ralph	158	" William 's upstairs , "
196133	196146	196122	196122	Ralph	158	" I 'll go and ask him to come down to you . "
196244	196251	196239	196239	she	133	" But where 's your luggage ? "
196272	196279	196268	196268	Cassandra	335	" I 've lost my luggage , "
196289	196296	196297	196297	she	335	" You 've lost your luggage , "
196401	196412	196370	196370	Katharine	335	" I believe it will fit you without any alteration . "
196443	196454	196433	196433	Ralph	158	" Why do n't you tell us you 're glad ? "
196574	196587	196588	196588	she	335	" I wo n't take that unless William gives it me himself , "
196591	196599	196588	196588	she	335	" Keep it for me , Katharine . "
196600	196610	196612	196612	Ralph	158	" I assure you everything 's perfectly all right , "
196614	196619	196612	196612	Ralph	158	" Let me tell William "
196668	196673	196674	196674	she	134	" My dear Cassandra ! "
196677	196690	196691	196691	she	134	" How delightful to see you back again ! What a coincidence ! "
196699	196726	196691	196691	she	134	" William is upstairs . The kettle boils over . Where 's Katharine , I say ? I go to look , and I find Cassandra ! "
196748	196753	196754	196754	she	134	" I find Cassandra , "
196757	196763	196764	196764	Katharine	335	" She missed her train , "
196775	196778	196780	196781	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Life , "
196793	196801	196780	196781	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" consists in missing trains and in finding "
196988	197005	197006	197006	she	134	" So much earth and so much water and that sublime spirit brooding over it all , "
197109	197114	197115	197115	she	134	" Katharine and Ralph , "
197125	197130	197115	197115	she	134	" William and Cassandra . "
197131	197141	197143	197143	William	180	" I feel myself in an entirely false position , "
197155	197187	197143	197143	William	180	" I 've no right to be sitting here . Mr. Hilbery told me yesterday to leave the house . I 'd no intention of coming back again . I shall now "
197188	197195	197196	197196	Cassandra	335	" I feel the same too , "
197199	197209	197196	197196	Cassandra	335	" After what Uncle Trevor said to me last night "
197210	197221	197222	197222	Rodney	180	" I have put you into a most odious position , "
197241	197266	197267	197267	he	180	" Until I have your father 's consent I have no right to speak to you let alone in this house , where my conduct "
197277	197290	197291	197291	he	180	" where my conduct has been reprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme , "
197297	197340	197341	197341	he	180	" I have explained everything to your mother . She is so generous as to try and make me believe that I have done no harm you have convinced her that my behavior , selfish and weak as it was selfish and weak "
197421	197433	197410	197410	she	335	" You 've nothing to reproach yourself with you 've been always "
197642	197654	197637	197637	her	335	" Well , that 's my last attempt at the dramatic . "
197655	197665	197667	197667	Ralph	158	" It 's astonishing what a distance they roll , "
197679	197691	197692	197693	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Do n't trouble do n't bother . We shall find it "
197704	197719	197692	197693	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Oh , Trevor , we 're looking for Cassandra 's engagement - ring ! "
197930	197952	197915	197915	she	134	" Oh , Trevor , please tell me , what was the date of the first performance of ' Hamlet ' ? "
198355	198379	198327	198328	Mrs. Hilbery	134	" Do n't stay if you want to go , Katharine . There 's the little room over there . Perhaps you and Ralph "
198380	198385	198387	198387	Katharine	335	" We 're engaged , "
198473	198483	198484	198484	he	138	" I gathered something of the kind last night , "
198487	198495	198484	198484	he	138	" I hope you 'll deserve her . "
198825	198829	198830	198830	she	335	" At last ! "
199094	199099	199100	199100	he	138	" Are you cold ? "
199110	199117	199118	199118	she	4449	" Yes , I am rather , "
199236	199242	199243	199243	she	4449	" Oh , that cottage , "
199246	199255	199243	199243	she	4449	" We must take it and go there . "
199256	199262	199263	199263	he	158	" And leave all this ? "
199266	199271	199272	199272	she	4449	" As you like , "
199324	199332	199334	199334	Ralph	158	" I 've something on my mind , "
199337	199364	199334	199334	Ralph	158	" I mean I 've been thinking of Mary Datchet . We 're very near her rooms now . Would you mind if we went there ? "
199447	199454	199455	199455	she	4449	" Did you treat her badly ? "
199463	199469	199470	199470	he	158	" I could defend myself , "
199476	199498	199499	199499	he	158	" But what 's the use , if one feels a thing ? I wo n't be with her a minute , "
199502	199508	199499	199499	he	158	" I 'll just tell her "
199509	199518	199520	199520	Katharine	335	" Of course , you must tell her , "
199555	199560	199561	199561	she	335	" I wish I wish "
199591	199596	199598	199598	Ralph	158	" I regret nothing , "
199649	199653	199654	199654	she	335	" Go on , "
199657	199661	199654	199654	she	335	" You regret nothing "
199662	199666	199667	199667	he	158	" Nothing nothing , "
199670	199675	199676	199676	she	335	" What a fire ! "
199719	199723	199724	199724	she	335	" Why nothing ? "
199754	199763	199764	199764	he	158	" What are you thinking of , Katharine ? "
199778	199830	199870	199870	She	335	" I was thinking of you yes , I swear it . Always of you , but you take such strange shapes in my mind . You 've destroyed my loneliness . Am I to tell you how I see you ? No , tell me tell me from the beginning . "
199878	199906	199870	199870	She	335	" But it was foolish to stand outside and look at the windows . Suppose William had n't seen you . Would you have gone to bed ? "
199932	199944	199945	199945	she	335	" But it was then I first knew I loved you ! "
199948	199955	199956	199956	he	158	" Tell me from the beginning , "
199960	199973	199974	199974	she	335	" No , I 'm a person who ca n't tell things , "
199977	199996	199974	199974	she	335	" I shall say something ridiculous something about flames fires . No , I ca n't tell you . "
200307	200317	200319	200319	Ralph	158	" That is the light in Mary 's room , "
200321	200328	200329	200329	He	158	" She must be at home . "
200342	200360	200361	200361	she	335	" Is she alone , working at this time of night ? What is she working at ? "
200364	200371	200372	200372	she	335	" Why should we interrupt her ? "
200376	200390	200391	200391	she	335	" What have we got to give her ? She 's happy too , "
200394	200400	200391	200391	she	335	" She has her work . "
200419	200430	200431	200431	Ralph	158	" You do n't want me to go to her ? "
200434	200447	200448	200448	she	335	" Go , if you like ; tell her what you like , "
200552	200557	200558	200558	she	335	" How they burn ! "
200617	200629	200630	200630	he	158	" I did n't go in I could n't bring myself , "
200754	200761	200762	200762	he	158	" Do you remember Sally Seal ? "
200770	200776	200777	200777	he	158	" Your mother and Mary ? "
200781	200792	200777	200777	he	158	" Rodney and Cassandra ? Old Joan up at Highgate ? "
200859	200871	200872	200872	Katherine	335	" It 's all so easy it 's all so simple , "
201437	201441	201442	201442	he	180	" Good night , "
201445	201449	201450	201450	she	335	" Good night , "
