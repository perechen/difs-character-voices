1803	1815	1817	1818	Sir Henry	296	" Hope you have n't got up specially to meet us , "
1820	1824	1817	1818	Sir Henry	296	" Too bad ! "
1825	1828	1830	1830	Evelyn	290	" No , "
1860	1865	1867	1868	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm glad , "
1881	1893	1817	1818	Sir Henry	296	" See . You 've come by the ' Caractacus ' ? "
1894	1961	1867	1868	Sir Henry	296	" Yes . My daughter has driven me and her maid and some of the light stuff up from Southampton . She 's the devil 's own driver , Gracie is , particularly at night . There are two or three cars behind us . But most of the passengers preferred to have their sleep out on the ship and wait for the boat - train . "
1962	1969	1971	1971	Evelyn	290	" You 're three days late , "
1973	1976	1977	1978	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , "
1981	1988	1990	1990	Evelyn	290	" Funny rumours about that ship , "
1992	1995	1997	1998	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , "
2633	2660	2622	2622	He	290	" How could I have been such a colossal fool , so blind , so deaf , so utterly mistaken in my estimate of a woman ? "
2958	2983	2992	2992	he	290	" Gracie , this is my friend , Mr. Orcham , the king of his world - I 've told you . My daughter . "
3026	3040	3042	3042	Gracie	297	" I do hope you have n't got up specially to meet us , "
3079	3086	3087	3087	he	290	" No , I did n't , "
3090	3127	3087	3087	he	290	" But if I 'd known you 'd be here so early I certainly might have done . The fact is , I 've got up to go with my meat - buyer to Smithfield Market . "
3150	3159	3161	3161	Gracie	297	" I must just lock up the car , "
3163	3170	3161	3161	Gracie	297	" Sha n't be two minutes . "
3175	3182	3183	3184	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm going to bed , "
3189	3195	3196	3196	she	297	" All right , daddy , "
3203	3218	3220	3221	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm fortunate enough to be able to sleep whenever I want to ! "
3225	3230	3220	3221	Sir Henry	296	" Useful , eh ? "
3231	3234	3235	3235	Evelyn	290	" Very , "
3317	3322	3323	3323	she	297	" No , no , "
3333	3341	3323	3323	she	297	" But have you got a gasper ? "
3342	3349	3351	3351	Evelyn	290	" I never smoke anything else , "
3353	3358	3360	3360	Gracie	297	" Neither do I , "
3362	3365	3360	3360	Gracie	297	" Thanks . "
3369	3373	3366	3366	He	290	" What next ? "
3506	3514	3515	3515	she	297	" Has daddy really gone to bed ? "
3526	3530	3482	3482	she	297	" He has . "
3531	3554	3482	3482	she	297	" He 's a great sleeper before the Lord . I suppose he told you about our cockleshell the ' Caractacus . ' "
3555	3574	3482	3482	she	297	" Not a word . What about it ? We did hear she 'd been rolling a bit . "
3575	3700	3482	3482	she	297	" Rolling a bit ! When we were a day out from New York , she rolled the dining - room windows under water . The fiddles were on the tables , but she threw all the crockery right over the fiddles . I was the only woman at dinner , and there was n't absolutely a legion of men either . They said that roll smashed seventeen thousand pounds ' worth of stuff . I thought she 'd never come up again . The second officer told daddy next day that he never thought she 'd come up again . It was perfectly thrilling . But she did come up . Everyone says she 's the worst roller that ever sailed the seas . "
3714	3717	3719	3719	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
3722	3743	3719	3719	Evelyn	290	" Of course it must have been pretty bad weather to make a big ship like that three days late . "
3744	3747	3749	3749	Gracie	297	" Weather ! "
3751	3829	3749	3749	Gracie	297	" The weather was awful , perfectly dreadful . But it was n't the weather that made her three days late . She split right across . Yes , split right across . The observation - deck . A three - inch split . Anyhow I could put my foot into it . Of course it was roped off . But they showed it to daddy . They had to . And I saw it with him . "
3830	3837	3838	3838	Evelyn	290	" Do you mean to say - "
3843	3852	3853	3853	Gracie	297	" Yes , I do mean to say , "
3857	3897	3853	3853	Gracie	297	" You ask daddy . Ask anyone who was on board . That 's why she 's going to be laid up for three months . They talk about 're - conditioning . ' But it 's the split . "
3898	3905	3906	3906	Evelyn	290	" But how on earth - ? "
3917	4003	3853	3853	Gracie	297	" Oh ! Strain , or something . They saidit was something to do with them putting two new lifts in , and removing a steel cross - beam or whatever they call it . But daddy says do n't you believe it . She 's too long for her strength , and she wo n't stand it in any weather worth talking about . Of course she was German built , and the Germans ca n't build like us . Do n't you agree ? "
4004	4011	4013	4013	Evelyn	290	" No . I do n't , "
4028	4040	3853	3853	Gracie	297	" Oh , you do n't ? That 's interesting now . "
4062	4065	4067	4067	Evelyn	290	" Now , "
4085	4157	4067	4067	Evelyn	290	" This is all very well , but what about Smithfield ? She is n't quite a young girl . She must be twenty - five , and she knows that I have n't got up at four o'clock for small - talk with women . Yet she behaves as if I had n't anything to do except listen to her . She may stay chattering here for half an hour . "
4629	4633	4634	4634	she	297	" Mr. Orcham , "
4645	4662	4634	4634	she	297	" will you do something for me ? . . .I simply dare n't ask you . "
4663	4668	4669	4669	he	296	" If I can , "
4681	4735	4675	4675	her	297	" Oh , you can ! I 've been dying for years to see Smithfield Market in the middle of the night . Would you mind very much taking me with you ? I would drive you there . The car 's all ready . I did n't lock it up after all . "
4787	4805	4779	4779	She	297	" I wo n't be in the way . I 'd be as small as a mouse . "
4840	4860	4779	4779	She	297	" But surely you must be terribly tired . I 've had four and a half hours ' sleep . "
4861	4890	4891	4891	She	297	" Me ! Tired ! I 'm like father - and you - I 'm never tired . Besides , I slept my head off on the ship . "
4908	4931	4935	4935	he	296	" Well , if you really are n't too tired , I shall be delighted . And the market is very interesting . "
5004	5010	5012	5012	she	297	" You 're frightfully kind , "
5014	5019	5012	5012	she	297	" I 'll just - "
5020	5030	5031	5031	he	296	" How did you know I 'm never tired ? "
5035	5044	5045	5045	she	297	" I could see it in your shoulders , "
5048	5056	5045	5045	she	297	" You are n't , are you ? "
5057	5061	5062	5062	he	296	" Not often , "
5071	5078	5079	5079	he	296	" See it in my shoulders , "
5082	5109	5079	5079	he	296	" Odd little creature . Her brain 's impish . That 's what it is . Well , perhaps she can see it in my shoulders . "
5115	5134	5136	5136	she	297	" I 'll just fly upstairs one moment . Sha n't keep you . Where 's the lift ? "
5145	5148	5149	5149	he	296	" Reyer , "
5152	5161	5149	5149	he	296	" Just see Miss Savott to her suite . "
5192	5246	5175	5175	Evelyn	290	" I know everyone thinks I 'm very reserved . And perhaps I am . But she 's got right through that , into me . And she 's the first . She must have taken a liking to me . Here I 've only known her about six minutes and she 's - "
6292	6308	6337	6338	the governor	896	" Morning , Jack . Sorry to keep you . Sha n't be a minute . "
6309	6331	6337	6338	the governor	896	" Morning , governor . No hurry , but we ought to be getting along . I have a taxi waiting . "
6344	6376	6337	6338	the governor	896	" Just tell me again about that Jebson young man . I want to know exactly before I see him . You said he 's only recently come into the business . "
6377	6382	6383	6383	Jack	295	" Yes , sir , "
6386	6618	6383	6383	Jack	295	" And if you ask me , he thinks he 's the emperor of Smithfield . His uncle 's a tough ' un , but nothing to young Charlie Jebson . I get on pretty comfortably with everybody in the markets except him . Tries to make out he do n't care whether he does business or not . But he ca n't put that across me . No ! And everybody but him knows he ca n't . His uncle knows it . Ten shilling a stone 's the right price for the best Scotch . And Charlie knows that too . But ' ten and six , ' he says . ' Ten and two , ' I say , wishing to meet him . ' Ten and two ! You 've got the b. ten and two fever , Cradock , ' he says . ' And you 've got the b. half - guinea fever . ' I says . ' Do n't ask me to come back , ' I says . ' Because I sha n't . I 've got my best coat on , ' I says . Then he turns on me and gives me a basinful , and I give him one . Nothing doing , governor . And his uncle 's afraid of him . It was all over the Market . "
6619	6622	6624	6624	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
6633	6643	6624	6624	Evelyn	290	" We 'll give him a miss in future . "
6644	6649	6651	6651	Jack	295	" Yes , governor , "
6654	6726	6651	6651	Jack	295	" But supposing he takes it , supposing he accepts of it ! Jebsons have the finest Scotch beef in the market . It was Charlie 's grandfather as started the Scotch beef trade in Smithfield . And the best Scotch - it 's none so easy to come by . Sometimes three days and I do n't see a side I fancy - not what you may call the best . "
6727	6735	6624	6624	Evelyn	290	" Try him with ten and four . "
6736	6765	6651	6651	Jack	295	" Yes , governor , and have all the rest of 'em jumping at me . Besides , I told him ten and two was my last word . "
6766	6771	6773	6773	Evelyn	290	" That 's enough , "
6775	6801	6802	6802	He	908	" If you said it you said it , and we sha n't go back on you , even if we have to buy Argentine ! "
6830	6835	6837	6837	Jack	295	" The fact is , "
6843	6904	6837	6837	Jack	295	" Charlie 's got it into his head that I 'm making a bit on it . And that 's why when you said you 'd come up with me one morning and show yourself , I thought it ' ud be a good move . If that wo n't settle Master Charlie , I do n't know what will . "
6911	6955	6907	6907	Jack	295	" Well then , why does n't he come ? I could have told him all this in the taxi . And this is the first time I 've ever had to tell him anything twice . I 'm going to be late . "
6956	6959	6961	6961	Evelyn	290	" Listen ! "
6969	7053	7054	7054	Evelyn	290	" You go on . Take the taxi you 've got . I 'll follow . I 'll ask for Jebsons ' , and you 'll find me somewhere near it . Sir Henry Savott - very important customer and a very important man too , in the City - wants me to take his daughter and show her Smithfield . Bit awkward . Could n't refuse though . They have a car here . I might get there before you , Jack . "
7098	7112	7113	7113	Jack	295	" Do you mean that young lady you were talking to , governor ? "
7123	7136	7113	7113	Jack	295	" Yes , that 's the one . Off you go now . "
7463	7471	7473	7473	she	796	" Sorry to keep you . Complications , "
7555	7558	7559	7559	she	796	" Open ? "
7570	7573	7624	7624	She	796	" Rather . "
7574	7601	7624	7624	She	796	" No . I 'll do it . This is a one - girl hood . You might just wind down the window on your side . "
7610	7620	7622	7622	Evelyn	290	" But I 'm going to sit by you , "
7636	7640	7642	7642	she	796	" Of course , "
7644	7659	7642	7642	she	796	" But I like it all open so that the wind can blow through . "
7836	7843	7844	7844	he	940	" Do you know the way ? "
7847	7851	7852	7852	she	796	" I do , "
7869	7878	7866	7866	she	796	" What brought you into the hotel business ? "
7884	7907	7879	7879	He	940	" The same thing that brought you to motoring . Instinct . I was always fond of handling people , and organising . "
7908	7921	7866	7866	she	796	" Always ? Do you mean even when you were a boy ? "
7922	7986	7879	7879	He	940	" Yes , when I was a boy . You know , clubs and things , and field - excursions . I managed the refreshment department at Earl 's Court one year . Then through some wine - merchant I got the management of the Wey Hotel at Weybridge . I rebuilt that . Then I had to add two wings to it . "
7987	7995	7866	7866	she	796	" But this present show of yours ? "
7996	8031	7879	7879	He	940	" Oh ! Well . They wanted a new manager here , and they sent for me . But I would n't leave the Wey . So to get me they bought the Wey . "
8032	8040	7866	7866	she	796	" And what happened to the Wey ? "
8041	8078	7879	7879	He	940	" Nothing . I 'm still running it . Going down there this morning . Ca n't go every day . When you 've got the largest luxury - hotel in the world on your hands - "
8079	8083	7866	7866	she	796	" The largest ? "
8084	8088	7879	7879	He	940	" The largest . "
8089	8101	7866	7866	she	796	" Have you been to America ? I thought in America - "
8102	8216	7879	7879	He	940	" Yes . All over America . I expected to learn a bit in America , but I did n't . You mean those ' 2,000 bedrooms - 2,000 bathrooms ' affairs . Ever stayed in one ? No , of course you have n't . Not your sort . Too wholesale and rough - and - ready . Not what we call luxury - hotels . Rather behind the times . They have n't got past ' period'-furnishing . Tudor style . Jacobean style . Louis Quinze room . And so on . And as for bathrooms - well , they have to come to my ' show ' to see bathrooms . "
8286	8290	8291	8291	she	943	" How funny ! "
8428	8575	8576	8576	He	950	" Her father might object . But I could handle her father . Besides - what a girl ! Lovely , and can do something ! No one who drives like her could possibly not have the stuff in her . I 've never met anybody like her . She likes me . No nonsense about her ! What a voice ! Her voice is enough . It 's like a blooming orchestra , soft and soothing , but so . . . Here ! What 's this ? What 's all this . It is n't an hour since I met her . I 'm the wildest idiot ever born . Marriage ? Never . A mistress ? Impossible . Neither she nor any other woman . The head of a ' show , ' as she calls it , like mine with a mistress ! "
8604	8709	8598	8598	her	951	" What I admire in you is that you do n't act . I know you must be a pretty biggish sort of a man . Well , father 's pretty big - at least I 'm always being told so - but father ca n't help acting the big man , acting what he is . He 's always feeling what he is . You 're big and so you must know you 're big ; but you just let it alone . It does n't worry you into acting the part . I know . I 've seen lots of big men . "
8710	8713	8715	8715	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
8737	8829	8731	8731	he	290	" And she had n't met me an hour ago ! What a girl ! No girl ever said anything as extraordinary as what she 's just said . And it 's true , what she says . Did n't I see it in her father ? I was afraid I might have seemed boastful , the way I talked about me and my ' show . ' But apparently she did n't misunderstand me . Most girls would have misunderstood . Really she is a bit out of the ordinary . "
8936	8949	8926	8926	Her	297	" And that 's that ! That 's how I do it ! "
8950	8953	8955	8955	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
8962	8982	8955	8955	Evelyn	290	" You said something about me . I 'll say something about you . You can drive a car . "
8986	8994	8983	8983	Gracie	297	" I do n't drive any more . "
8995	9008	8926	8926	Her	297	" What do you mean - you do n't drive any more ? "
9009	9028	8983	8983	Gracie	297	" I mean race - track driving . I 've given it up . This is n't driving . "
9029	9034	8926	8926	Her	297	" Had an accident ? "
9035	9085	9086	9086	She	297	" An accident ? No ! I 've never touched a thing in my life . But I might have done . I thought it was n't good enough - the risk . So I gave it up . I thought I might as well keep the slate clean . "
9094	9108	9109	9109	Evelyn	290	" And what a slate ! What a nerve to retire like that ! "
9116	9121	9109	9109	Evelyn	290	" You 're amazing ! "
9139	9145	9147	9147	Gracie	297	" So here we are , "
9163	9173	9174	9174	she	297	" Can I leave my car here , officer ? "
9193	9198	9181	9182	The policeman	957	" Yes , miss . "
9199	9206	9181	9182	The policeman	957	" It 'll be quite safe ? "
9207	9218	9181	9182	The policeman	957	" I 'll keep an eye on it , miss . "
9219	9223	9181	9182	The policeman	957	" Thank you . "
9725	9733	9718	9718	Gracie	304	" You dirty old tea - leaf . "
9734	9745	9718	9718	Gracie	304	" Go on , you son of an unmarried woman . "
10088	10096	10083	10084	Her father	799	" You ca n't stick to anything . "
10837	10844	10846	10846	Evelyn	290	" Ah ! There 's Cradock , "
10848	10877	10846	10846	Evelyn	290	" He 's our buyer . I 'll introduce him to you . The little man there . The one that 's sticking a skewer into that lamb . "
10946	10951	10954	10954	him	295	" Chines and ends , "
10970	10977	10979	10979	Evelyn	290	" Here we are , Cradock , "
10981	11003	10979	10979	Evelyn	290	" This is Miss Savott . Knows all about motor - racing . Now she wants to know all about Smithfield . "
11014	11026	11027	11027	Gracie	304	" I do think your market is marvellous , Mr. Cradock ! "
11051	11059	11039	11039	Her	304	" Glad to meet you , miss . "

11076	11105	11106	11106	He	295	" Glad to hear that , miss . There 's some of 'em would sooner have the old green . . . a bit of it over there . "
11109	11123	11039	11039	Her	304	" That 's nice too . But I prefer the blue , myself . "
11166	11176	11163	11163	He	295	" Governor knows what 's what . Trust him ! "
11252	11260	11261	11261	he	295	" You see those lambs , sir , "
11264	11281	11261	11261	he	295	" I guarantee there is n't ten lambs like them in all London to - day ! "
11353	11369	11371	11371	Jack	295	" That 's got to be served , for lunch at the hotel this morning , "
11375	11469	11371	11371	Jack	295	" We hang the beef for five or six days - used to hang it for twelve or fourteen . But you ladies and gentlemen alter your tastes , you see , miss , and we have to follow . You see all that calves ' liver there . Not so many years ago , I could buy as much as I wanted at sixpence a pound . Would you believe me , it costs me two shillings these days ! All because them Harley Street doctors say it 's good for anamia . "
11475	11486	11487	11487	He	290	" That 's Charlie Jebson , governor . Next door . "
11492	11501	11503	11503	Evelyn	290	" Let 's go and talk to him , "
11526	11556	11507	11509	Mr. Charles Jebson	305	" This is my governor , Mr. Orcham , Charlie . And this is Miss Savott , come to see what we do up here . Mr. Charles Jebson . "
11592	11601	11585	11585	Gracie	297	" What a dance I could lead him ! "
11602	11613	11614	11614	she	297	" You do get up early here , Mr. Jebson , "
11617	11623	11614	11614	she	297	" When do you sleep ? "
11624	11631	11632	11632	he	305	" I do n't , miss , "
11637	11712	11632	11632	he	305	" At least - well , three or four hours . Make it up Sundays . Perhaps you know the Shaftesbury , in Shaftesbury Avenue . Express lunch and supper counter . That 's mine . They call me ' the governor ' there , when I go in of a night to tackle the books and keep an eye on things . Not so much time for sleep , you 'll freely admit . "
11743	11750	11751	11751	she	297	" It 's all too marvellous ! "
11836	11842	11843	11843	she	297	" Why is she here ? "
11851	11896	11897	11897	He	295	" I could n't say , miss , for sure . Little Sister of the Poor , or something . Come for what she can get . Food for orphans , I should n't be surprised . They 're very generous in the Market . "
11911	11923	11897	11897	He	295	" Governor 's got a bit of business with Mr. Jebson . "
11924	11928	11930	11930	she	297	" Oh yes . "
11940	11943	11944	11944	he	295	" Refrigerators , "
11947	11967	11944	11944	he	295	" Thirty years ago when I first came here there was n't an ice - box in the place . "
11992	12009	12010	12010	Evelyn	290	" I hope we shall be able to continue to do business together , Mr. Jebson , "
12015	12029	12030	12030	Charlie	305	" It wo n't be my fault if we do n't , sir , "
12034	12039	12041	12041	Evelyn	290	" That 's good , "
12043	12084	12085	12085	He	290	" I know there 's no beef better than yours . I did n't know you had a restaurant . I 've often noticed the Shaftesbury . One night I shall come in . I 'm rather interested in restaurants . "
12088	12104	12144	12144	Evelyn	290	" Thank you , sir . It 'll be a great honour when you do . "
12130	12141	12144	12144	Evelyn	290	" That 'll be all right now , I think , "
12291	12304	12283	12283	Cradock	295	" Hello , Jim . I want a hundred pounds of fat . "
12305	12310	12283	12283	Cradock	295	" Two and four , "
12315	12326	12283	12283	Cradock	295	" That 's where you 're wrong . Two shillings . "
12327	12336	12283	12283	Cradock	295	" And that 's where you 're wrong . "
12337	12342	12344	12344	Jack	295	" Two and two , "
12346	12349	12351	12351	Jim	317	" Oh , "
12357	12375	12351	12351	Jim	317	" I 'll give it you for your birthday . I know how hard up you are . "
12398	12413	12376	12376	Jack	295	" Hello , Jack . Not seen you lately . Had a fair holiday ? "
12414	12417	12419	12419	Cradock	295	" Yes , "
12421	12449	12450	12450	He	295	" I have had a fair holiday . I 'm not like some of you chaps . When I go for a holiday I take my wife . "
12454	12460	12461	12461	he	295	" Excuse me , miss , "
12475	12484	12485	12485	Evelyn	290	" Miss Savott might like to go down , "
12500	12515	12518	12518	Gracie	297	" If you 'll excuse me , governor . I 'll see you afterwards . "
12524	12564	12518	12518	Gracie	297	" I 've got a bit to do , and time 's getting on . If I do n't keep two ton o ' meat in stock down at the Imperial Palace the governor would pass me a remark . "
12605	12611	12613	12613	Gracie	297	" What a lovely man ! "
12617	12625	12627	12627	Evelyn	290	" You heard that phrase in America ! "
12700	12704	12706	12709	the lift - attendant	1084	" As big ? "
12717	12760	12706	12709	the lift - attendant	1084	" It 's a lot bigger than Euston or St. Pancras or King 's Cross . If you ask me , it 's the longest station in London ... No , the meat trains are all come and gone an hour ago . "
12771	12780	12706	12709	the lift - attendant	1084	" No , that 's only some empties . "
12911	12918	12919	12919	Gracie	297	" What are you thinking about ? "
12923	12943	12983	12983	Evelyn	290	" If you want to know , I was thinking about that split ship of yours . And you ? "
12955	12982	12952	12952	she	297	" I was only thinking of those lambs , when they were in the fields , wagging their silly little tails while they sucked milk in . "
13011	13024	13025	13025	she	297	" It 's so hot . I mean I 'm so hot , "
13224	13227	13228	13228	she	297	" Ah ! "
13234	13251	13228	13228	she	297	" His instinct for handling people ! Could he handle me ? Could he handle me ? "
13417	13428	13429	13429	she	297	" I might write down my impressions of all that , "
13480	13495	13496	13496	Evelyn	290	" That 's the last of the big luggage for the ' Leviathan ' , "
13518	13545	13496	13496	Evelyn	290	" Special train leaves Waterloo at 8.20 . Passengers hate to have to catch it , but they always do manage to catch it - somehow . "
13578	13584	13585	13585	Gracie	297	" Good morning , Compton , "
13598	13606	13590	13590	she	297	" How long have you been here ? "
13607	13614	13551	13563	A chauffeur , who had been leaning against the rail of the luggage	1120	" About an hour , miss . "
13615	13625	13590	13590	she	297	" Have you had the big stuff sent upstairs ? "
13626	13632	13551	13563	A chauffeur , who had been leaning against the rail of the luggage	1120	" Oh yes , miss . "
13633	13652	13590	13590	she	297	" There 's the beginning of a rattle in the bonnet here . Have a look at it . "
13653	13667	13551	13563	A chauffeur , who had been leaning against the rail of the luggage	1120	" Yes , miss . Certainly , miss . Any orders , miss ? "
13668	13683	13590	13590	she	297	" Not to - day . But I do n't know about Sir Henry . "
13684	13689	13551	13563	A chauffeur , who had been leaning against the rail of the luggage	1120	" No , miss . "
13690	13733	13590	13590	she	297	" Better put the car in the hotel garage , and tell them to clean her . If I want her I 'll get her out myself . I 'm going to bed . You ought to get some sleep , too . "
13734	13740	13551	13563	A chauffeur , who had been leaning against the rail of the luggage	1120	" Very good , miss . "
13791	13803	13805	13805	Evelyn	290	" There 's something at the back of your left shoulder , "
13811	13814	13815	13815	She	1124	" What ? "
13821	13831	13777	13777	she	1124	" A stain . Why ! It 's blood . "
13832	13835	13777	13777	she	1124	" Blood ? "
13836	13879	13777	13777	she	1124	" Yes . You must have got it after we came up into the Market again . You were n't wearing your cloak then . You were wearing it before . And you could n't have got it down in the station . "
13880	13887	13888	13888	she	1124	" What a detective you are ! "
13923	13950	13913	13913	she	1124	" The valet will take it out for you , if your maid ca n't . They 're very good at that , our valets are . "
13951	13959	13913	13913	she	1124	" At getting out blood - stains ? "
13960	13964	13965	13965	Evelyn	290	" Any stains . "

14089	14103	14104	14104	Evelyn	290	" How many departures by the ' Leviathan ' this morning , Sam ? "
14117	14122	14124	14124	Sam	294	" Eighteen , sir , "
14136	14139	14047	14047	she	1124	" Hm ! "
14279	14284	14285	14285	he	290	" Not a word , "
14290	14297	14285	14285	he	290	" Not a word about what ? "
14298	14368	14285	14285	he	290	" Your split ship . I looked at the posters in Fleet Street . Nothing on them . Of course there would n't be . Terrific thing , and yet they can hush it up . And there is n't a newspaper office in London that does n't know all about it by this time . And you 'll see it wo n't be in the evening papers either . "
14427	14430	14431	14431	he	290	" See , "
14459	14487	14431	14431	he	290	" my hotel 's waking up for the day . You 're just in time to see my hotel waking up . It 's a great moment . "
14556	14563	14551	14551	She	1142	" Good morning , Miss Maclaren . "
14564	14570	14551	14551	She	1142	" Good morning , sir . "

14587	14617	14582	14582	he	290	" That is to say , one of our housekeepers . We have eight , not counting the head - housekeeper , who 's the mother of us all . "
14630	14644	14645	14645	he	290	" Is n't Miss Brury on duty to - day , Miss Maclaren ? "
14648	14655	14582	14582	he	290	" She 's unwell , sir . "
14656	14670	14582	14582	he	290	" Sorry to hear that . Things are a bit late this morning . "
14671	14702	14582	14582	he	290	" Yes , sir . Something wrong with the clocking apparatus . Turnstile would n't turn . Mr. Maxon could n't explain it , but he got it put right . "
14703	14714	14715	14715	Evelyn	290	" Everyone except heads of departments has to clock in , "
14720	14737	14715	14715	Evelyn	290	" Thirteen hundred of 'em , not counting the Laundry and the works department - outside . "
14738	14743	14744	14744	Gracie	297	" What a swarm ! "
14898	14915	14916	14916	she	319	" You always have to be at them , but they 're a very decent lot , "
14946	14949	14951	14951	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
14965	15038	15041	15041	he	290	" The women - guests are fast asleep on their private embroidered pillows upstairs , all in silk pyjamas and nighties , and these women here have cleaned their homes and got breakfasts and washed children and been sworn at probably , some of them , and walked a mile or two through the streets , and put on their overalls , and here they are swilling and dusting like the devil ! "
15046	15059	15041	15041	he	290	" Come and see the restaurant . Wo n't take a moment . "
15157	15160	15162	15162	Gracie	297	" Yes , "

15404	15414	15415	15415	he	290	" Am I ? I do believe I am , "
15440	15481	15434	15434	he	290	" Who does she think she is , cheeking me , after inviting herself to Smithfield and all that ? Never saw her in my life until this morning , and she has the nerve to call me a child ! "
15892	15898	15899	15901	the chief engineer	1217	" You see those things , "
15908	15924	15899	15901	the chief engineer	1217	" If they shut up , the blessed hotel would have to shut right up . "

16266	16274	16407	16415	a small group of men who were clocking in	1248	" But why ? It 's mine . "

16289	16293	16407	16415	a small group of men who were clocking in	1248	" A month . "
16294	16328	16264	16264	authority	323	" Well , when you 've been here a month of Sundays you 'll have got into your head that nobody can take anything out of here without me seeing what it is . "
16329	16337	16407	16415	a small group of men who were clocking in	1248	" I call it a wicked shame . "
16338	16372	16264	16264	authority	323	" It may be . But it 's the rule of the hotel . Last year I caught a girl slipping out with a pair of sheets where they ought n't to be . "
16373	16386	16388	16389	the girl	796	" This despatch - case wo n't hold a pair of sheets , "

17083	17111	17112	17112	Adolphe	326	" I suppose because you 'd been seen once or twice in the hall , and you were n't in your rooms . Excuse me , sir . "

17157	17196	17154	17154	Evelyn	290	" he ought to be fast asleep now , instead of pursuing me with telephone - messages that take everything for granted . How does he know that I 've not gone to bed same as he has ? "

18352	18358	18342	18343	The girl	796	" Another slice , sir ? "
18359	18376	18342	18343	The girl	796	" I think I will . I was up rather early . Remind me to shave . "
18572	18575	18576	18576	she	304	" Tessa ! "
18906	18917	18904	18904	Tessa	331	" Oh ! I 've cut myself with the scissors ! "
19993	20023	19990	19990	he	1350	" If you please , miss , there is a telephone - message for Sir Henry ; he does not answer the telephone and his bedroom door is locked . "
20024	20028	20030	20030	Gracie	304	" What next ? "
20043	20049	20036	20037	the waiter	1350	" What is the message ? "
20062	20086	20087	20087	She	304	" Mr. Orcham is very sorry to say that he has outside appointments which will keep him away from the hotel all day . "
20093	20107	20087	20087	She	304	" All right . I 'll see that Sir Henry gets the message . "
20191	20197	20198	20198	she	304	" Why ca n't I ? "
20225	20295	20296	20296	She	304	" I say , dad - yes , it 's me - do you know you 've been fast asleep and they 've been trying to get a message to you , from Mr. Orcham . He says he 'll let you know as soon as possible later in the day . He 's frightfully sorry , but he 's just had to go out on very urgent business . "
20770	20774	20775	20775	he	290	" You understand , "
20785	20788	20775	20775	he	290	" nothing ! "
21275	21286	21288	21288	Evelyn	290	" Who 's No . 341 , 2 and 3 ? "
21302	21309	21311	21314	the Reception - manager	1393	" A Mr. Amersham - Australian , "
21317	21322	21311	21314	the Reception - manager	1393	" Why , sir ? "
21323	21354	21355	21355	Evelyn	290	" Nothing . I only happened to notice that a lady could n't persuade herself to leave his rooms till three o'clock this morning . Colonials are always so attractive , "
21365	21378	21355	21355	Evelyn	290	" Give me yesterday 's figures for the restaurant , Miss Cass . "
21383	21481	21379	21380	Miss Cass	336	" Ah ! Nineteen pounds up on last year , but twenty - one more meals served . So it ca n't be that people are n't satisfied with the music or the cabaret . Average bill slightly less , and consumption of champagne per head distinctly less than last year . If we go on at this rate our L100,000 stock of wine will last for about fifty years . In fact Prohibition would serve no purpose . Might suggest to Maître Planquet that he ought to season his dishes with a view to inducing thirst . "
21565	21581	21582	21582	Evelyn	290	" I 'd like to see the comparative graphs to - night , Miss Cass , "
22362	22370	22372	22373	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" I have n't got much time , "
22375	22389	22372	22373	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" What is going to be done about that mink - fur business ? "
22395	22408	22391	22391	her	339	" You are males . You ought to know . Answer me . "
22568	22571	22573	22573	Evelyn	290	" Mink ? "
22592	22603	22605	22606	Mr. Cousin	334	" I only heard of it myself an hour since , "
22608	22626	22627	22628	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" You were not in your office at half - past twelve last night , Mr. Cousin , "
22643	22646	22648	22649	Mr. Cousin	334	" No , "
22651	22661	22648	22649	Mr. Cousin	334	" I went home at a quarter to twelve . "
22662	22665	22667	22668	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Ah ! "
22671	22679	22667	22668	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" This happened at twelve - thirty . "
22989	23095	22985	22986	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Long Sam told me that by the time she reached the doors she was demanding about a million pounds damages . No , she had n't a car and she would n't have a taxi - said she would n't , not for a million pounds - another million pounds - be beholden to the hotel for anything ... Oh yes , I came downstairs . I was reading . They fetched me - for Alice Brury ... No , the two companions of the infuriated lady had left earlier . She 'd stayed talking to someone ... Miss Brury 's in bed today . "
23287	23296	23298	23299	Mr. Cousin	334	" I 've just been talking to O'Connor , "
23303	23330	23298	23299	Mr. Cousin	334	" He 's coming at once . He says he thinks he may have heard of the lady before . He 's calling at the Yard . "
23340	23346	23347	23347	Evelyn	290	" I daresay he has , "
23350	23422	23347	23347	Evelyn	290	" The woman is almost certainly - well , does n't matter what she is . She may get away with it . And if we have to pay her her million pounds or the National Debt , of course we shall pay it and look pleasant , and that will be that . It 's that scene that matters . You 're sure Miss Brury started it , Mrs. O'Riordan ? "
23423	23429	23431	23432	the Irishwoman	1522	" She admits it herself , "
23434	23443	23431	23432	the Irishwoman	1522	" But when you think of the provocation - "
23444	23458	23459	23459	Evelyn	290	" There ca n't be any such thing as provocation in this hotel , "
23464	23526	23459	23459	Evelyn	290	" There never has been before , and there must n't be again . If the customer is Judas Iscariot , he 's still the customer till he 's safely outside the hotel . That 's a principle . The hotel turns the other cheek every time . I 'm afraid we shall have to find another job for Miss Brury . "
23531	23545	23459	23459	Evelyn	290	" The poor thing says she would n't stay on here for anything . "
23546	23550	23552	23552	Evelyn	290	" Well then , "
23554	23566	23552	23552	Evelyn	290	" We must struggle on as best we can without her . "
23567	23570	23572	23573	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Yes , "
23582	23603	23604	23604	She	339	" It 's all very well for you men to talk like that . But if you knew the difficulties - "
23630	23638	23640	23640	Evelyn	290	" We 'll have a chat later , "
23941	23950	23952	23953	Miss Cass	336	" S O S from Weybridge , sir , "
23957	24020	24105	24108	the hotel - manager	1543	" Some difficulty with the contractors over the alterations to the restaurant . The work is at a standstill . Mr. Plott would be very much obliged if you could run down there at once , instead of this afternoon . But you ca n't . You are due at the Laundry at eleven . It 's after half - past ten . "
24021	24027	24029	24029	Evelyn	290	" Why ca n't I ? "
24032	24074	24029	24029	Evelyn	290	" I could go to the Laundry this afternoon . Tell them I 'll be there at three - no , four . And tell Mr. Plott I 'm coming to him now . And ask if my car is waiting . "
24075	24089	24105	24108	the hotel - manager	1543	" It 's bound to be , sir . Brench is always early . "
24090	24101	24102	24102	Evelyn	290	" I 'll leave the rest to you , Cousin , "
25347	25380	25339	25339	Evelyn	290	" Sir - Having been apprised that you are about to inaugurate a laundry on modern lines , I beg respectfully to offer my services as manager . I am at present ... "
25652	25687	25648	25648	his	347	" Of course you are my emperor , but between ourselves I am as good as you , and you know it , and you know also that I have always delivered the goods . "
25742	25752	25754	25754	he	347	" I must really show you this , sir , "
25774	25777	25778	25778	he	347	" Question , "
25787	25873	25778	25778	he	347	" Why are white fabrics blued in order to procure a general appearance of whiteness ? ' Answer : ' White fabrics are blued because there are more yellow rays in the spectrum , and we use blue to counteract the yellow rays . ' Would n't you say , sir , that that 's rather well and tersely put for a girl of sixteen and a half ? These exam . papers are useful as an index to character as well as to attainments . "
25888	25899	25901	25901	he	347	" I see you 've got all the painting finished , "
25903	25908	25901	25901	he	347	" Looks much better . "
25909	25912	25914	25915	Mr. Purkin	347	" Ah ! "
25917	25943	25914	25915	Mr. Purkin	347	" Ah ! I must show you one thing that I thought of . An idea I had , and I 've carried it out . "
26032	26094	26011	26011	He	347	" Red for hot water , blue for cold water , yellow for steam . The three primary colours . When a minor repair is necessary it is n't always easy to tell at a glance everywhere which pipe is which . By this system you ca n't make a mistake . Costs no more . I thought you 'd approve . "
26095	26098	26100	26100	Evelyn	290	" Brilliant , "
26102	26109	26100	26100	Evelyn	290	" Brilliant . I congratulate you . "
26122	26130	26131	26132	Mr. Purkin	347	" And there 's the new drier , "
26270	26315	26266	26266	he	290	" This chap is putting off the fatal moment on purpose . And doing it very well too . Creating all this atmosphere of approval . Damn clever fellow ! Pity he is n't clever enough to see that I can see though him . "
26339	26450	26332	26333	the Midlander	1648	" I 'm glad you were able to come to - day , sir , because I was getting anxious for you to see for yourself we are n't standing still here . I know you 're always interested , very interested , but we like to see you here , all of 'em like to see you . It makes us all feel that we kind of ' belong' ... Oh ! Upon my word , I was forgetting to tell you that the number of pieces from private customers passed the twenty thousand mark last week - at last . You 'll receive the figures to - morrow . "
26451	26462	26332	26333	the Midlander	1648	" Good ! Good ! You always said it would . "
26463	26476	26332	26333	the Midlander	1648	" But there was another thing I wanted to see you about . "
26477	26480	26481	26481	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
26487	26499	26332	26333	the Midlander	1648	" Yes . About those frilled dress - shirts last Thursday . "
26500	26505	26332	26333	the Midlander	1648	" Oh ! That ! "
26506	26509	26511	26512	Mr. Purkin	347	" Yes , "
26514	26533	26511	26512	Mr. Purkin	347	" Yes , sir . You may have forgotten , but I can assure that I have n't . "
26731	26745	26746	26746	he	1650	" Can I rely on having these three shirts back to - night ? "
26985	26997	26999	26999	Evelyn	290	" I was under the impression that it had been explained , "
27001	27034	26999	26999	Evelyn	290	" You had only one girl who specialised in these preposterous shirts , and she was taken ill or something at the very moment when your need of her was most desperate . "
27035	27040	27042	27043	Mr. Purkin	347	" No , sir , "
27048	27189	27042	27043	Mr. Purkin	347	" the matter has not been explained - to you ; at least not satisfactorily . The girl , Rose , was not taken ill . She merely walked out and left us in the lurch . We have the best class of girls here . I remember when laundry staffs had to be recruited from riff - raff . We 've altered all that , by improving the conditions . I knew Rose ; I thought highly of her ; I knew her father , a house - painter , most respectable . And yet she walks out ! She 'll never walk in again , I may say , not as long as I 'm manager here . Naturally I got the shirts done , in a way , next morning . But that 's not the point . "
27217	27222	27224	27224	Evelyn	290	" What a man ! "
27227	27254	27255	27255	He	347	" Such loyalty to the I.P.H.L. is priceless . Of course his sense of proportion 's a bit askew ; but you ca n't have everything . "
27261	27269	27255	27255	He	347	" Why did this Rose walk out ? "
27270	27273	27275	27276	Mr. Purkin	347	" Ah ! "
27278	27286	27287	27287	He	347	" I will tell you , sir . "
27312	27320	27310	27310	Evelyn	290	" That 's why she walked out . "
27343	27524	27339	27339	her	1676	" Look at it , Mr. Orcham . You see the number of bad teeth on it . I ordered her the dentist . She made an excuse twice - something about her mother 's wishes , I 'm certain it was n't the father . As you know better than anyone , every girl who 's engaged by me here has to promise she 'll allow us to keep her in good health , mother or no mother . On that afternoon I told her I 'd made an appointment for her with the dentist for the next morning , and that she positively must keep it . I spoke very quietly . Well , as soon as my back is turned out of this Laundry she walks ! Without notice ! Of course it was the staff - manageress 's business to see to it . But as she had failed twice , I had to take the matter up myself . No alternative . Discipline is discipline . And just look at the charts of that mouth ! "
27525	27528	27530	27530	Evelyn	290	" Quite ! "
27540	27543	27532	27532	He	1677	" Quite ! "
27544	27549	27550	27551	Mr. Purkin	347	" The truth is , "
27554	27579	27550	27551	Mr. Purkin	347	" there would have been no bother - I 'm sure of it - if only I 'd had a little more moral support . "
27681	27684	27686	27686	Evelyn	290	" Thanks , "
27720	27730	27705	27705	he	290	" You mean support from the staff - manageress ? "
27731	27738	27740	27741	Mr. Purkin	347	" I mean Miss - er , "
27815	27818	27820	27820	Evelyn	290	" Sex ! "
27822	27830	27820	27820	Evelyn	290	" Sex ! Here it is again . "
28135	28145	28147	28148	Mr. Purkin	347	" I would n't say one word against her , "
28160	28251	28252	28252	He	347	" I chose her out of scores , and probably a better woman for the job of staff - manageress could n't be found . But in this matter - and in one or two others similar - I 'm bound to admit I 've been a bit disappointed . Discipline is the foundation of everything here , and if it is n't enforced , where are you ? I 'm bound to say I do n't quite see ... She 's inclined to be very set in her views . "
28261	28266	28268	28268	Evelyn	290	" Curse this sex ! "
28270	28347	28268	28268	Evelyn	290	" She 's refused him . Or they 've had a row . Or something else has happened . He wants her to go . He 'll make her go . He ca n't bear her here . She 's on his nerves . But he 's still in love with her , even if he does n't know it . What a complication ! How the devil can you handle it ? Curse this sex ! "
28406	28409	28411	28411	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
28416	28442	28411	28411	Evelyn	290	" We 'd better leave things for a while . If I do get a chance perhaps I might have a chat with Miss Powler - "
28443	28457	28459	28460	Mr. Purkin	347	" Well , Mr. Orcham , if anybody can do anything you can . "
28523	28526	28517	28517	He	347	" Home . "
28532	28535	28537	28537	Evelyn	290	" Wait , "
28651	28654	28681	28681	She	353	" Staffmanageress . "
28709	28713	28714	28715	Miss Powler	353	" But Lilian , "
28719	28775	28714	28715	Miss Powler	353	" You know well enough that a red thread means starched ; you know that no articles from No . 291 have to be starched , and yet you put a red thread into this one . Why ? There must be some explanation , and I want you to tell me what it is . "
28783	28788	28790	28791	the woman	1424	" But , miss , "
28799	28814	28790	28791	the woman	1424	" this is n't a red thread - it 's green - not starched . "
28815	28822	28867	28868	Miss Powler	353	" That 's a green thread ? "
28823	28828	28790	28791	the woman	1424	" Yes , miss . "
28829	28840	28841	28842	The woman	1424	" Take it to the window and look at it . "
28845	28856	28858	28858	she	1424	" Yes , miss . It 's green all right , "
28878	28903	28873	28873	she	353	" Very well . Never mind , Lilian . You come and see me before you start work to - morrow , will you ? "
28922	28929	28930	28930	Evelyn	290	" Colour - blind , eh ? "
28939	28959	28930	28930	Evelyn	290	" I happened to hear . Door open . Did n't want to break in . So I waited . "
28960	28988	29029	29030	Miss Powler	353	" Yes , Mr. Orcham . Please excuse me . I had n't the slightest idea you were at the door . Yes , colour - blind . "
29007	29023	29024	29024	Evelyn	290	" As a funny coincidence I really think that ought to have the first prize . "
29033	29080	29029	29030	Miss Powler	353	" I suppose she 's the one woman in the place who ought to be able to be relied on to tell green from red , and she 's colour - blind ! No , not first prize . No . It deserves a gold medal . "
29093	29142	29081	29081	His	290	" Sort of thing you ca n't possibly foresee , therefore ca n't guard against , eh ? Unless Mr. Purkin decides to institute eye - tests for the staff . But of course those delightful coincidences never happen twice . How 's the Dramatic Society getting along ? "
29447	29450	29451	29451	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
29454	29492	29451	29451	Evelyn	290	" you 're the staff - manageress , according to the label on your door , and I must tell you that I think you managed the Lilian member of the staff very nicely . Very nicely . "
29497	29509	29451	29451	Evelyn	290	" But all cases are n't so simple , are they ? "
29510	29517	29451	29451	Evelyn	290	" They are n't , sir . "
29518	29574	29575	29576	Two fibs	1733	" I 've been asking Mr. Purkin about the Rose member . Mrs. O'Riordan , our head - housekeeper at the Palace , was particularly anxious for me to enquire into Rose 's case . In fact , between ourselves , that was one of the reasons why I came down here to - day . "
29719	29727	29729	29730	Miss Powler	353	" I was sorry to lose Rose , "
29732	29898	29729	29730	Miss Powler	353	" She was a first - rate fancy ironer . But of course if she had n't gone of her own accord she 'd have had to go all the same . Because she 'd never have let the dentist attend to her . She 's too fond of her mother for that . She adores her . The mother 's rather pretty and really very young . When she was Rose 's age she was a chorus - girl in a touring company for six months . She ought to have kept on being a chorus - girl . She certainly was n't fit to be a mother . Her head 's full of the silliest ideas , poor thing ! One of her ideas is that dentists pull teeth out for the sake of doing it . Makes them feel proud , she thinks . No use arguing with that sort of a woman . They really believe whatever they want to believe . "
29899	29906	29699	29700	Miss Powler	353	" I know what you mean . "
29907	30109	29729	29730	Miss Powler	353	" She made Rose promise not to see the dentist , said it was slave - driving for an employer to force a girl to see a dentist . And all that . She 'll go on the stage , Rose will , and her father wo n't be able to stop her . I 'm very sorry for the girl . Naturally , if Mr. Purkin makes a rule and gives an order , there 's nothing more to be said . I quite see his point of view . Yes . I agree with him - I mean about discipline . But I do think you ca n't improve silly people when they get obstinate . If they ca n't understand , they ca n't , and you ca n't make them . It could n't be helped , but I always sympathise with the girl in Rose 's position . I wish you could have heard her talk about her mother . She never mentioned her father . Always her mother . She worshipped her mother . And yet she gave you the idea too that she was mother to her mother , not her mother 's daughter . "
30846	30857	30858	30858	he	1753	" I had another reason for calling to - day , "
30871	30885	30886	30886	He	1753	" We may soon be needing someone rather like you at the Palace . "
30889	30927	30886	30886	He	1753	" I ca n't say anything more just now . But perhaps it would n't be a bad thing if you considered whether you would care for a change . Do n't answer . Good - bye . "
31148	31158	31159	31159	she	297	" I 've written all my impressions of Smithfield , "
31206	31218	31219	31219	he	290	" Was it to tell me that that you stopped me ? "
31229	31235	31236	31236	She	297	" Do n't crush me . "
31239	31249	31273	31273	her	297	" How did you know it was my car ? "
31259	31264	31265	31265	she	297	" That 's nicer , "
31303	31375	31300	31300	Gracie	304	" I asked the number of your car before I left the hotel . How else ? And I was about five minutes in getting it . They told me you 'd probably be at the Laundry , and they gave me the address . I had an instinct I might meet you on the way ; that was why I asked the number . And a good thing I did ! "
31662	31668	31669	31669	he	290	" Is anything the matter ? "
31672	31683	31647	31647	she	1773	" Not yet . But I must talk to you . "
31684	31687	31647	31647	she	1773	" Well ? "
31688	31698	31699	31699	she	1773	" Not here . We ca n't talk here , "
31702	31710	31699	31699	she	1773	" And not at the hotel either . "
31711	31718	31719	31719	he	290	" Certainly not at the hotel , "
31726	31731	31647	31647	she	1773	" Where , then ? "
31732	31739	31647	31647	she	1773	" If you 'll get in - "
31740	31747	31647	31647	she	1773	" But what about my car ? "
31748	31776	31647	31647	she	1773	" Send it home . I 'd come with you in your car , but I ca n't leave mine here in the street , can I ? "
31815	31827	31828	31828	he	290	" I sha n't want you any more to - night , "
31848	31862	31864	31864	Gracie	304	" She looks a bit better now . I 've had her cleaned , "
32003	32006	32007	32007	he	290	" Well ? "
32012	32016	32019	32019	she	304	" Not yet . "
32026	32032	32019	32019	she	304	" I know a place . "
32052	32060	32047	32047	Evelyn	290	" What has to be will be . "
32199	32202	32182	32182	Gracie	304	" Shades . "
32203	32208	32210	32210	Gracie	304	" Here it is , "
32231	32234	32235	32235	he	765	" Here ? "
32238	32241	32182	32182	Gracie	304	" Yes . "
32242	32249	32250	32250	he	765	" Do you know the place ? "
32254	32278	32182	32182	Gracie	304	" No . But I happened to notice it as I drove down . It calls itself the Prince of Wales 's Feathers . "
32279	32290	32182	32182	Gracie	304	" Do you mean you want to go in here ? "
32291	32308	32182	32182	Gracie	304	" Yes . To talk . Why not ? We could n't have a safer place . "
32363	32371	32372	32372	she	1810	" That ought to be all right , "
32563	32572	32574	32574	Gracie	304	" Oh ! What a horrible lovely place ! "
32585	32597	32574	32574	Gracie	304	" But it 's exactly what I thought it would be . "
32605	32610	32612	32612	Gracie	304	" This is mine , "
32621	32628	32631	32631	Evelyn	290	" Two light sherries , please . "
32633	32637	32631	32631	Evelyn	290	" That right ? "
32638	32645	32647	32648	the barman	1817	" Right you are , miss , "
32751	32766	32767	32767	he	1817	" A bit too much of the oriental attitude about me about young women ! "
32770	32777	32779	32780	the barman	1817	" Here you are , sir , "
32800	32807	32788	32788	Evelyn	290	" One and four , sir . "
32969	32976	32978	32978	Gracie	304	" You give me that twopence , "
32996	33004	32986	32986	Evelyn	290	" And I 'll give you eighteenpence . "
33097	33100	33102	33102	Gracie	304	" Yours ! "
33108	33117	33102	33102	Gracie	304	" You are n't cross , are you ? "
33118	33126	33174	33174	he	290	" No . Why should I be ? "
33127	33133	33135	33135	Gracie	304	" I do n't know , "
33137	33147	33135	33135	Gracie	304	" But you look so severe I 'm frightened . "
33148	33157	33158	33158	Evelyn	290	" Take more than that to frighten you , "
33166	33173	33174	33174	he	290	" Not a bad sherry this , "
33223	33236	33238	33238	Gracie	304	" But it is rather a jolly place , is n't it ? "
33240	33253	33238	33238	Gracie	304	" Do come down off the roof to the ground - floor . "
33508	33522	33523	33523	Gracie	304	" You know the telephone - message you sent to daddy this morning . "
33528	33542	33543	33543	She	304	" Well , daddy was fast asleep , and it came to me . "
33553	33563	33543	33543	She	304	" That 's why I wanted to see you . "
33592	33612	33613	33613	she	304	" I 'd like you to do something . I could n't bear any trouble between you and daddy , "
33686	33695	33680	33680	He	290	" What would you like me to do ? "
33786	33807	33856	33856	They	1857	" Could n't you ask daddy to dinner to - night - and me ? He 'd appreciate it frightfully . "
33955	33958	33947	33947	They	1857	" Jock , "
33959	33962	33947	33947	They	1857	" Jock , "
34021	34081	34011	34011	his	1864	" When I 've had a drop over night , do you know what I do ? I get up early and I go down to my cellar in my nighty , and I draw myself a port - glass of gin , and I drink that and it puts me right . Yes . That puts me right . "
34082	34091	34093	34094	another gravely	1865	" Well , give me Eno every time , "
34107	34110	34101	34101	Evelyn	290	" No . "
34111	34114	34093	34094	another gravely	1865	" No ? "
34115	34133	34101	34101	Evelyn	290	" No . That would n't suit my book at all . Your father would misunderstand it . "
34137	34150	34151	34151	Evelyn	290	" He 'd think I 'd mean what I should n't mean , "
34154	34158	34160	34160	Gracie	304	" I see , "
34162	34170	34160	34160	Gracie	304	" I had n't thought of that . "
34175	34192	34193	34193	Gracie	304	" Well , if daddy asks you to dinner to - night , will you come ? "
34242	34245	34247	34247	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
34249	34267	34247	34247	Evelyn	290	" With pleasure . But in the restaurant , not upstairs But he wo n't ask me ? "
34268	34281	34282	34283	A horn	1870	" Oh ! Wo n't he ? You leave that to me . "
34287	34296	34297	34297	Gracie	304	" That 's children playing with the car ! "
34370	34377	34378	34378	Gracie	304	" We may as well go , "
34381	34390	34378	34378	Gracie	304	" Yes , I ought to be going . "
34405	34408	34378	34378	Gracie	304	" Why ? "
34409	34417	34419	34419	Evelyn	290	" Because I want to get out , "
34421	34431	34378	34378	Gracie	304	" But I 'll drive you to the hotel . "
34432	34437	34438	34438	Evelyn	290	" No , thanks ! "
34553	34566	34567	34567	she	1882	" You 're afraid of being seen with me in my car , "
34580	34584	34567	34567	she	1882	" I am . "
34834	34841	34820	34820	Gracie	297	" Daddy , I understand now . "
34842	34846	34852	34853	Henry Savott	296	" Understand what ? "
34847	34851	34852	34853	Henry Savott	296	" You know . "
34862	34868	34852	34853	Henry Savott	296	" Better late than never . "
34888	34906	34874	34874	she	297	" I 'm not going to be in anybody 's ' custody ' ! What a word ! "
34947	34980	34937	34937	Gracie	297	" I 'd love to see the Court that could make me live with anybody I do n't want to live with . I 'm coming to live with you , daddy . "
35196	35229	35190	35191	Sir Henry	296	" Do n't make a fool of yourself , and I wo n't make a fool of myself or of you . You leave me alone and I 'll leave you alone . "
35501	35507	35508	35508	he	296	" The Bible and Shakspere , "
35511	35514	35508	35508	he	296	" Still ? "
35515	35531	35533	35533	Gracie	297	" The Bible and Shakspere still . And I do n't know which is best , "
35535	35544	35545	35545	he	296	" Why this surprising passion for the classics ? "
35549	35559	35561	35561	Gracie	297	" I only like them - that 's all , "
35564	35572	35561	35561	Gracie	297	" I 'm just reading the Psalms . "
35573	35578	35579	35579	he	296	" Why the Psalms ? "
35586	35608	35579	35579	he	296	" I should have thought the biography of David would be more in your line - as a contemporary young woman . "
35609	35617	35618	35618	Gracie	297	" The Psalms are David 's biography , "
35624	35646	35647	35647	He	296	" How does the kid think of these remarks of hers . Something in that . I never thought of it . "
35654	35657	35658	35658	he	296	" Oh ! "
35661	35676	35618	35618	Gracie	297	" Yes . The finest thing in all the Bible is in the Psalms . "
35677	35680	35681	35681	he	296	" Oh ! "
35686	35697	35681	35681	he	296	" What 's that ? I 'd like to hear . "
35705	35720	35618	35618	Gracie	297	" Be still , and know that I am God . ' Be still . "Sombrely
35806	35820	35821	35821	he	296	" Shall I ever get to the bottom of this kid 's mind ? "
35862	35875	35896	35896	She	796	" What are you going to do to - night , daddy ? "
35876	35895	35896	35896	She	796	" I 'm going to bed . You know I never do anything the first day , anywhere . "
35905	35908	35909	35909	she	796	" Because , "
35912	35920	35909	35909	she	796	" I 've just seen Mr. Orcham . "
35921	35930	35932	35933	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm waiting to hear from him , "
35936	35953	35896	35896	She	796	" He 's only this minute come back into the hotel . Been out all day . "
35954	35960	35896	35896	She	796	" How do you know ? "
35961	35972	35896	35896	She	796	" Do n't I say I 've just seen him ? "
35973	35983	35984	35985	Sir Henry	296	" You seem to be very friendly with him ? "
35989	36004	35896	35896	She	796	" Oh ! I am ! He took me to Smithfield Market this morning . "
36005	36016	35896	35896	She	796	" He asked you to go to Smithfield with him ! "
36017	36027	35896	35896	She	796	" No . I asked him to take me . "
36028	36031	35896	35896	She	796	" When ? "
36032	36040	35896	35896	She	796	" After you went off to bed . "
36041	36056	36058	36059	Sir Henry	296	" I hope he did n't think I 'd put you up to it , "
36063	36135	35896	35896	She	796	" How could he have thought that ? I did n't know he was going to Smithfield until a minute before you went off . I 'm glad I asked him . It was most frightfully amusing . And if I 'd gone to bed I should n't have been able to sleep . It filled in the time perfectly . I was thinking you might invite him to dinner tonight . "
36136	36192	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" I invite him to dinner ! And in his own hotel ! No fear ! The last thing I want is for him to think I 'm running after him . You can understand that . If he does n't suggest anything , after my message to him , I sha n't suggest anything . "
36199	36216	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" Then you go to bed , and I 'll ask him . I like him . "
36232	36238	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" He wo n't accept . "
36239	36249	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" I 'll bet ten to one he will . "
36250	36259	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" In the restaurant ? He wo n't . "
36260	36267	36193	36193	Gracie	297	" Well , we 'll see . "
36313	36336	36337	36338	Sir Henry	296	" You ask him for both of us . Nine o'clock . Send a note down . Let me know the reply . "
36347	36350	36351	36351	she	297	" Father , "
36365	36372	36351	36351	she	297	" What 's his Christian name ? "
36381	36419	36373	36373	She	297	" Dear Mr. Evelyn Orcham . Father and I would be so glad if you would dine with us tonight in the restaurant . Nine o'clock . Please do n't disappoint us . Yours sincerely , G. S. "
36885	36905	36907	36907	Evelyn	290	" I was just going to telephone up to you , and suggest an appointment for to - morrow , "
36910	36921	36907	36907	Evelyn	290	" when I got your daughter 's most kind invitation . "
36922	36934	36936	36937	Sir Henry	296	" Very good of you to accept at such short notice , "
36939	36944	36936	36937	Sir Henry	296	" Have a cocktail ? "
36945	36950	36952	36952	Evelyn	290	" Yes , thanks , "
36961	36970	36972	36973	Sir Henry	296	" What 's the matter with the bar ? "
36975	36983	36972	36973	Sir Henry	296	" Ihear you 've had it redecorated . "
36984	36992	36936	36937	Sir Henry	296	" But Miss - er - Gracie ? "
36993	37014	37016	37017	Sir Henry	296	" Gracie has never been known to be less than a quarter of an hour late for lunch or dinner , "
37019	37032	37033	37033	he	296	" Like most women she has a disorderly mind . Not disordered , "
37166	37180	37162	37162	Evelyn	290	" She said she 'd fix it , and she 's fixed it . "
37186	37215	37181	37182	Sir Henry	296	" What 's the meaning of this whim for getting this fellow to dinner? ... 'Be still , and know that I am God . ' Good God ! "
37269	37273	37274	37274	he	296	" Very original , "
37277	37295	37274	37274	he	296	" Charming . I expect it was good for a bit of useful publicity , this was . "
37296	37300	37302	37302	Evelyn	290	" It was , "
37304	37314	37302	37302	Evelyn	290	" Change from the traditional British bar , eh ? "
37346	37349	37350	37350	Evelyn	290	" Maddix , "
37453	37465	37466	37466	Evelyn	290	" Well , Maddix , what 's your latest ? Apollo ? "
37472	37498	37542	37542	his	368	" The Apollo is quite new , sir . But my latest I 've christened Green Parrot . I only really finished it last night . "
37499	37506	37542	37542	his	368	" Not on the market yet ? "
37507	37516	37542	37542	his	368	" Not as you might say , sir . "
37517	37530	37542	37542	his	368	" Well , Sir Henry , will you try a Green Parrot ? "
37531	37538	37540	37540	Maddix	368	" Good evening , Sir Henry , "
37553	37561	37562	37563	Sir Henry	296	" Why of course it 's Maddix ! "
37571	37602	37562	37563	Sir Henry	296	" How are you , Maddix ? Have n't seen you since God knows when - at the Plaza in New York . You were a very famous figure there . "
37611	37616	37617	37617	he	368	" Yes , sir , "
37621	37652	37617	37617	he	368	" I suppose I was . I suppose I was the best - known barman in New York for twenty years . Prohibition and Mr. Orcham brought me back home . "
37653	37660	37661	37662	Sir Henry	296	" And how are the boys ? "
37665	37677	37661	37662	Sir Henry	296	" Which boys , Sir Henry ? The general bar population ? "
37678	37687	37603	37603	Maddix	368	" No . Your two sons of course . "
37757	37796	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" Thank you for remembering them , Sir Henry . The eldest is still over there . Fur trade . Seems to be dollars in it . The other one 's with me and his mother , here . "
37797	37804	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" And what 's he doing ? "
37805	37894	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" Well , Sir Henry , you may think it queer . But I 've got a tennis court back of my little house at Fulham , and the boy 's gone mad on tennis . He means to be a professional player . His mother is n't very pleased . But I say , ' What can you do - if he 's made up his mind ? ' Between parents and children things are n't what they used to be , are they , Sir Henry ? "
37895	37900	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" They are not , "
37909	37918	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" A Green Parrot then , Sir Henry ? "
37919	37925	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" I 'll risk it . "
37926	37932	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" And you , sir ? "
37936	37939	37901	37902	the millionaire	2001	" Soft . "
37940	37946	37948	37948	Maddix	368	" Excuse me , gentlemen , "
37950	37961	37962	37962	He	368	" I should prefer to mix that Green Parrot myself . "
37966	37970	37972	37973	Sir Henry	296	" A character ! "
37975	37988	37972	37973	Sir Henry	296	" How did you manage to get him away from New York ? "
37989	38002	38003	38003	Evelyn	290	" I saw him once or twice when I was over there , "
38007	38115	38003	38003	Evelyn	290	" He said he 'd like to come home . I believed him . Considering Prohibition ! A man who can live for twenty years behind a New York bar and never pick up an American accent - and never use a word of American slang - well , there must be something incurably English about him . I told him I had the finest American bar in the world , and I wanted the finest barman in the world to take charge of it . He came . Of course he gets the salary of an Under - Secretary of State . So he ought to . "
38116	38127	38129	38130	Sir Henry	296	" Not quite the cocktail hour here , is it ? "
38144	38201	38003	38003	Evelyn	290	" No . It 's too late and too early . But it 'll soon be the liqueur hour . Extraordinary how many men prefer to come in here for a drink at the end of a meal . They feel more at home near a bar , even if they do n't stand at it . "
38278	38287	38288	38288	he	290	" And I say that gin is the - "
38325	38358	38322	38322	He	290	" There was a quality about that wigwam in the Westminster Bridge Road that this place has n't got . The free - and - easy ! This place is too stiff . "
38386	38389	38390	38390	he	290	" No ! "
38393	38405	38390	38390	he	290	" Could n't be done . Would n't do , either . "
38513	38522	38495	38495	Maddix	368	" Well , what abaht it , guv'nor ? "
38546	38555	38542	38542	himself	368	" Mr. Orcham is not much for cocktails . "
38556	38569	38570	38570	Evelyn	290	" I 'm much more for cocktails than you are , Maddix , "
38578	38585	38570	38570	Evelyn	290	" Maddix is a strict teetotaller . "
38586	38597	38599	38600	Sir Henry	296	" Then how do you manage to invent these things ? "
38609	38617	38618	38619	Sir Henry	296	" I taste . I never swallow . "
38638	38645	38631	38632	a connoisseur	2015	" Very original . Very good . "
38804	38815	38798	38798	Evelyn	290	" Perhaps we ought to go back to the foyer . '
38816	38821	38823	38824	Sir Henry	296	" Lots of time , "
38858	38870	38850	38852	every masculine face	2024	" Strange things have happened , but this is the strangest . "
38944	38960	38930	38930	Maddix	368	" A greater than me is here . Let him deal with the unparalleled outrage . "
39034	39046	39047	39049	the smiling woman	2032	" I got tired of waiting for you in the foyer , "
39057	39065	39047	39049	the smiling woman	2032	" So I asked where you were . "
39080	39085	39087	39088	Sir Henry	296	" Been waiting long ? "
39090	39113	39116	39116	her	2032	" Oh no ! Not more than an hour . This place is more old - fashioned than I thought it was . "
39133	39169	39116	39116	her	2032	" I think a public - house would be more up - to - date than this . I know I should adore public - houses . Do n't you adore them , Mr. Orcham ? "
39170	39182	39184	39184	Evelyn	290	" I 'm not very well acquainted with public - houses , "
39186	39192	39116	39116	her	2032	" Never been in one ? "
39193	39199	39116	39116	her	2032	" Oh yes . Once . "
39200	39205	39116	39116	her	2032	" How long ago ? "
39206	39214	39116	39116	her	2032	" Oh ! Not very long ago . "
39554	39567	39569	39569	Evelyn	290	" You 're doing some business here to - night , Cappone , "
39732	39736	39738	39738	Evelyn	290	" Same girl , "
39740	39762	39738	39738	Evelyn	290	" who was hobnobbing with me in a leather coat about two minutes since in the Prince of Wales 's Feathers ! "
39852	39860	39862	39863	Sir Henry	296	" Well now , let 's see , "
39876	39894	39862	39863	Sir Henry	296	" Oh ! Look here , Cappone , I think we 'll leave it all to you . "
39895	39905	39907	39908	Mr. Cappone	372	" Very well , Sir Henry . Thank you , "
39921	39932	39933	39934	Sir Henry	296	" That 's right , is n't it , Orcham ? "
39937	39947	39949	39949	Evelyn	290	" You could n't have done better , Savott , "
39955	39965	39967	39967	Gracie	297	" I suppose he 's the head - waiter , "
39973	39978	39979	39979	Evelyn	290	" Head - waiter ! "
39991	40021	39979	39979	Evelyn	290	" I 'm glad he did n't hear you . There are thirty head - waiters in this room . No . Cappone is the manager of the restaurant . "
40072	40088	40089	40089	Gracie	297	" And all he has to do is to look romantic and be exquisitely polite ? "
40100	40107	40108	40108	Evelyn	290	" Yes . That 's all , "
40114	40326	40108	40108	Evelyn	290	" Well , there may be one or two other things he has to do . Settle the menus with the chef . Attend conferences . Watch the graph curves of the average bill every day . Explain satisfactorily the occasional presence of a worm in a lettuce - not so simple , that ! Know the names and private histories and weaknesses and vanities and doings of every regular customer . Talk four languages . Keep the peace among his staff over the distribution of the tips . Know exactly how every dish is cooked . Persuade every customer that he has got the best table in the place . Prevent customers who prefer the prix fixe from choosing more expensive things than the price will stand . Find new waiters , because even waiters die and quarrel and so on . That 's one of his worries , the waiter question . You ca n't bring foreigners into the country , and English lads simply refuse to go abroad to finish their education . Cappone says that English waiters would be as good as any , and better in some ways ; only there 's one thing they ca n't learn , and it 's the most important thing . "
40327	40334	40335	40336	Sir Henry	296	" Ha ! What 's that ? "
40339	40382	40383	40383	Evelyn	290	" That the customer is always right , of course . It 's that terrible British sense of justice ! Well , those are a few of the odd trifles that our graceful friend has to think about , besides looking romantic , "
40393	40409	40390	40390	He	296	" Why am I talking like this ? Why have I got the note wrong ? "
40410	40416	40418	40418	Gracie	297	" It 's perfectly thrilling , "
40434	40447	40429	40429	Evelyn	290	" She understands . She has imagination . More than daddy has . "
40448	40453	40454	40455	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , yes , "
40472	40479	40480	40480	Gracie	297	" Do tell us some more , "
40498	40502	40491	40491	her	297	" About waiters ? "
40503	40512	40513	40513	Evelyn	290	" About anything . Yes , about waiters . "
40536	40539	40541	40541	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
40543	40625	40541	40541	Evelyn	290	" Cappone says that English waiters look very smart in the street , off duty , but in the restaurant they do n't care how they look , whereas his precious Italians look very smart on duty , and do n't look like anything on earth in the street . I mean the commis of course , the youths in the long aprons . Not the chefs de rang . English or not , they have to look smart on duty . "
40736	40748	40731	40731	Evelyn	290	" I could n't smile like that to save my life . "
40749	40755	40756	40756	Gracie	297	" He 's a dear , "
40769	40776	40767	40767	Evelyn	290	" Go on . Go on . "
40803	40810	40812	40813	Sir Henry	296	" Hello ! What 's this ? "
40818	40821	40823	40823	Evelyn	290	" Vodka , "
40825	40832	40834	40834	his	296	" I hope it 's vodka . "
40838	40847	40834	40834	his	296	" No doubt you thought it was gin . "
41138	41146	41148	41148	Gracie	297	" So you 've fallen for it , "
41159	41164	41166	41166	Evelyn	290	" Fallen for what ? "
41168	41171	41166	41166	Evelyn	290	" Cabaret . "
41172	41183	41185	41185	Evelyn	290	" We 've had a cabaret here for two years , "
41492	41499	41500	41500	he	290	" The public is an enigma , "
41503	41525	41500	41500	he	290	" They like it ; but what do they like in it ? I would n't look twice at it myself . "
41669	41679	41680	41680	He	290	" She will be round again in a moment . "
42081	42090	42092	42093	Sir Henry	296	" The roof'll be off in a minute , "
42213	42260	42210	42210	Evelyn	290	" What on earth has Jones Wyatt been thinking about ? This clown fellow has been set an impossible task . It 's not fair to him . He must come before Volivia , not after . I 'll have it altered for the midnight performance . "
42261	42267	42269	42270	Sir Henry	296	" You know , really , "
42278	42287	42288	42288	Evelyn	290	" Those boys were better than the girl . "
42294	42329	42288	42288	Evelyn	290	" Does he mean it ? Or is he just pretending to be judicial , saving his face for us and for himself too ? After the exhibition he 's been making of himself ! "
42350	42358	42359	42360	Sir Henry	296	" Where did you pick her up ? "
42368	42406	42359	42360	Sir Henry	296	" Prague , I believe . Praha 's its new name , is n't it ? I have a man always running about the Continent after really good turns . They 're not so easy to find . "
42407	42413	42450	42450	he	296	" Cost you a lot ? "
42424	42439	42417	42417	He	296	" Oh ! A goodish bit . I do n't remember the exact figure . "
42475	42512	42514	42514	he	296	" Yes . Volivia and Co. stand us in for eighty pounds a week . The other turn forty or fifty . Bands and cabaret come to not a penny less than twelve hundred a week . "
42519	42529	42514	42514	he	296	" Get that into your head , my friend . "
42530	42535	42536	42537	Sir Henry	296	" Bands so much ? "
42545	42548	42536	42537	Sir Henry	296	" Yes . "
42549	42554	42514	42514	he	296	" How many bands ? "
42555	42558	42536	42537	Sir Henry	296	" Three . "
42559	42564	42514	42514	he	296	" One 's American ? "
42565	42572	42573	42573	Evelyn	290	" Yes . Here they are . "
42588	42599	42601	42602	Sir Henry	296	" I knew they got biggish money in New York , "
42604	42612	42613	42613	Evelyn	290	" They get biggish money in London , "
42616	42675	42613	42613	Evelyn	290	" Why ! I happened to be going out by the Queen Anne entrance the other day , and the whole alley was blocked with cars . I asked the porter about it - he 's a waggish sort of a chap . He told me they were the cars of ' the gentlemen of the orchestra ' ! "
42676	42680	42681	42682	Sir Henry	296	" By Jove ! "
42688	42707	42681	42682	Sir Henry	296	" There 's Harry Matcham . The very man I want to see . That big round table . "
42708	42712	42613	42613	Evelyn	290	" Lord Watlington ? "
42713	42741	42681	42682	Sir Henry	296	" Yes . Gracie , I think I 'd better step over to him now and fix a date . Excuse me , Orcham - one second . "
42780	42786	42787	42787	she	297	" Step over , daddy , "
42790	42807	42809	42809	Evelyn	290	" Lord Watlington has n't had a dinner - party here for quite a long time , "
42811	42822	42809	42809	Evelyn	290	" Cappone was beginning to think he 'd deserted us . "
42832	42861	42828	42828	Evelyn	290	" I see Mrs. Penkethman with him , and Lady Devizes and the two Cheddars . Rather Renaissance young men , those Cheddars , do n't you think ? "
42872	42882	42868	42868	Evelyn	290	" I do n't recognise any of the others . "
42883	42887	42889	42889	Gracie	297	" You know , "
42903	42914	42889	42889	Gracie	297	" that would n't do in a drawing - room . "
42915	42921	42868	42868	Evelyn	290	" What would n't do ? "
42922	42927	42889	42889	Gracie	297	" That Volivia show . "
42928	42933	42934	42934	Evelyn	290	" No . Scarcely , "
42937	43046	42934	42934	Evelyn	290	" A drawing - room would be a bit too intimate for it . But if it pleases people in a restaurant - well , there you are ; it pleases them . Volivia 's the biggest cabaret success we 've ever had here . Now before the war that turn would n't have been respectable . I do believe it would have emptied any restaurant - or filled it with exactly the sort of person we do n't want . But we give it now , and the Palace is just as respectable as ever it was . More , even . Look at the people here ! "
43047	43052	43054	43054	Gracie	297	" It was shameless , "
43056	43061	43062	43062	Evelyn	290	" Perhaps too shameless , "
43065	43160	43161	43161	He	290	" I admit I should have had my doubts about it if I 'd seen it on the first night . But the proof of the pudding is in the eating . It 's audiences that make a show respectable - or not . I 've heard our Cabaret - manager say it takes two to settle that point - the show and the audience . But I do n't think so . The audience settles it . I 'm sure some of these variety artists start out to be - well , questionable . "
43182	43204	43176	43176	He	290	" But sufficient applause , frank , unreserved applause , will make them feel absolutely virtuous with the very same show . "
43236	43246	43247	43247	he	290	" I 'm sorry you think it was shameless , "
43261	43269	43270	43270	she	297	" I loved it for being shameless , "
43287	43348	43270	43270	she	297	" Why should n't it be shameless ? We are n't shameless enough . What 's the matter with the flesh anyway ? Do n't we all know what we are ? If I could give a performance like Volivia 's , would n't I just go on the stage ! Nobody should stop me , I tell you that . "
43363	43382	43356	43356	she	297	" I 'm rather like Volivia . Only she was born to perform , and I was n't . "
43494	43512	43513	43513	He	290	" I suppose this is the modern girl . I must n't lose my presence of mind . "
43522	43540	43513	43513	He	290	" And yet you say Volivia would n't do in a drawing - room ! Why not ? "
43541	43631	43491	43491	Evelyn	290	" Simply because in a drawing - room she 'd make me feel uncomfortable . If I feel uncomfortable I always know something 's wrong . But here I did n't feel a bit uncomfortable . You did , and so did daddy . But not me . Besides , you would n't agree that what ca n't be done in a drawing - room ought n't to be done at all . A big restaurant 's much the same as a bedroom . You see what I mean ? "
43632	43636	43513	43513	He	290	" Not quite . "
43637	43643	43645	43645	Gracie	297	" Well , you will , "
43650	43661	43645	43645	Gracie	297	" Are n't you going to ask me to dance ? "
43662	43669	43513	43513	He	290	" In the middle of dinner ? "
43670	43681	43645	43645	Gracie	297	" Why not ? What a question , from you ! "
43686	43691	43513	43513	He	290	" Big Oak Band , "
43907	43913	43915	43915	Evelyn	290	" I do n't dance , "
44089	44098	44100	44100	she	297	" Oh ! So you do n't dance ! "
44138	44147	44148	44148	she	297	" Why do you have American bands here ? "
44187	44194	44195	44195	he	372	" Because they 're the best , "
44204	44393	44195	44195	he	372	" We 're miles behind them in this country . You see , the dance craze started earlier over there than here . They 're better disciplined , and they have a better rhythm . They 've taught us a lot . An English player who takes his work seriously will give his head to play next to an American for a month . Rather ! Of course we get the best even of the Americans , because we give the best treatment , to say nothing of the best advertisement - not direct advertisement . Oh no ! Never ! The tall fellow with the saxophone - he earns fifty pounds a week . We give them a sitting - room and dressing - rooms , and a valet , and two porters to carry their instruments about . We even press their clothes for them free of charge . They behave like dukes , and we behave to them as if they were dukes . But we would n't look at 'em if we could find any English band as good , or nearly as good . "
44443	44451	44453	44453	Gracie	297	" Well , I never knew that , "
44463	44478	44453	44453	Gracie	297	" I thought it was a question of fashion , and pleasing American customers . "
44479	44485	44487	44487	Evelyn	290	" Not in the least ! "
44491	44520	44487	44487	Evelyn	290	" We make fashions here . We do n't follow fashions . And we do n't kowtow to Americans or anybody else . The Palace is the Palace . "
44524	44528	44529	44529	he	290	" Excuse me , "
44535	44542	44544	44544	Gracie	297	" I like to hear you , "
44577	44592	44593	44593	she	2168	" Mr. Orcham and I are going to have just one dance , daddy , "
44597	44612	44593	44593	she	2168	" You get on with your trout . Then we shall be level again . "
44630	44633	44614	44614	she	2168	" But - "
44725	44750	44722	44722	he	290	" After all , why should n't I dance on my own floor ? It is n't as if her father was n't here . "
44816	44826	44828	44828	Evelyn	290	" I wish that fellow 's contract was over , "
44846	44854	44843	44843	Gracie	297	" Are you doing it on purpose ? "
44855	44858	44843	44843	Gracie	297	" What ? "
44859	44864	44865	44865	She	297	" Holding me off ? "
44890	44893	44895	44895	Evelyn	290	" Sorry , "
44923	44929	44930	44930	she	297	" You are a fibster , "
44939	44944	44930	44930	she	297	" You dance beautifully . "
44945	44956	44957	44957	Evelyn	290	" I do n't know any steps except this one , "
44960	44968	44957	44957	Evelyn	290	" It 's too monotonous for you . "
44969	44975	44977	44977	she	297	" I 'm loving it , "
45099	45124	45096	45096	He	290	" Is it possible that she has taken a fancy to me ? If not , what can be the explanation of her game ? "
45265	45270	45292	45294	the Cheddar brothers	2180	" Hello , darling ! "
45271	45277	45279	45279	Gracie	297	" Hello , Nancy darling , "
45305	45316	45318	45318	Nancy	385	" When am I going to see you , darling ? "
45320	45331	45318	45318	Nancy	385	" I 'm perishing to hear all about New York . "
45349	45360	45362	45362	Gracie	297	" What 's wrong with to - night , darling ? "
45364	45396	45362	45362	Gracie	297	" Up in my rooms . I 'm staying here . So 's father . Eleven - thirty , say . Bring the others along . We 'll have a time . "
45397	45414	45436	45439	The Big Oak Band	2185	" The Lord Harry wo n't come . He 's got a political date with the P.M. "
45415	45423	45362	45362	Gracie	297	" Never mind . Bring whoever'll come . "
45493	45499	45500	45500	he	290	" Thank you very much , "
45504	45509	45510	45510	Gracie	297	" I loved it , "
45513	45519	45520	45521	Sir Henry	296	" Good band , eh ? "
45539	45543	45545	45545	Evelyn	290	" The best , "
45547	45559	45520	45521	Sir Henry	296	" I say , daddy . Did you order a sweet ? "
45560	45563	45564	45565	Sir Henry	296	" No , "
45568	45581	45564	45565	Sir Henry	296	" I ordered nothing , and I never do order a sweet . "
45582	45588	45590	45590	Gracie	297	" But I want one , "
45592	45604	45564	45565	Sir Henry	296	" Well , have one . The Imperial Palace is yours . "
45605	45611	45564	45565	Sir Henry	296	" What about a soufflé ? "
45612	45623	45624	45624	Evelyn	290	" That will take twenty to twenty - five minutes , "
45628	45636	45564	45565	Sir Henry	296	" What does that matter , sweetie ? "
45668	45706	45662	45662	he	290	" And while we 're waiting could n't we just go and see the kitchens ? I 've never seen a hotel kitchen , and I 'm crazy about hotels now . ' Crazy ' ! Pardon ! "
45717	45726	45707	45707	Gracie	297	" Reminiscence of New York , of course . "
45727	45733	45734	45734	Evelyn	290	" Crazy about hotels now ! "
45740	45748	45750	45751	Sir Henry	296	" That 's not a bad notion , "
46063	46072	46074	46074	Evelyn	290	" You 'll soon get used to it , "
46086	46090	46091	46091	He	290	" See here ! "
46116	46119	46120	46120	He	290	" See ? "
46130	46140	46120	46120	He	290	" ' 37 . ' That 's your table . "
46141	46147	46149	46149	Gracie	297	" And what 's that ? "
46159	46184	46120	46120	He	290	" ' 10.12 . ' That 's the time of the order . We stamp it . There 's the machine that does it . "
46185	46190	46192	46193	Sir Henry	296	" Good ! Good ! "
46205	46208	46210	46210	Gracie	297	" Oh ! "
46215	46224	46210	46210	Gracie	297	" Do let 's see the soufflé made . "
46225	46229	46231	46231	Evelyn	290	" We will ! "
46243	46266	46240	46240	he	290	" Has she come here because she is really interested , or because she wants to persuade me that she is interested ? "
46293	46306	46307	46307	he	290	" But what a marvellous figure she makes here in her finery ! "
46310	46313	46314	46314	Gracie	297	" Oh ! "
46328	46333	46314	46314	Gracie	297	" What 's this ? "
46366	46370	46372	46372	he	2203	" Des truites , "
46375	46388	46390	46391	Sir Henry	296	" They little know the recent fate of three of their brothers ! "
46395	46412	46413	46413	Gracie	297	" How horrible ! How can you , father ? Put them back , please do . "
46460	46467	46469	46470	Sir Henry	296	" You 're pretty busy here ! "
46477	46482	46483	46483	Evelyn	290	" This is nothing , "
46487	46530	46483	46483	Evelyn	290	" You should see the place at a quarter to two when everyone wants lunch at the same moment , and watch the battle at that counter . There 'd be sixty cooks here then . This is comparatively a slack time . "
46582	46585	46587	46587	Evelyn	290	" Ah ! "
46589	46599	46587	46587	Evelyn	290	" Here 's Planquet , the chef of chefs . "
46606	46613	46614	46614	Evelyn	290	" Let me introduce Maître Planquet , "
46798	46821	46786	46786	his	1015	" Surely you did not imagine that any but a Frenchman of the Midi could possibly be the head of my profession ? "
46944	46947	46949	46949	Gracie	297	" Ah ! "
46972	46981	46949	46949	Gracie	297	" They have not yet acquired their individualities . "
47012	47021	47006	47006	Evelyn	290	" She is no ordinary woman , this ! "
47103	47114	47116	47116	he	2231	" We return always to the old methods , mademoiselle , "
47118	47151	47116	47116	he	2231	" Here in this kitchen we cook by electricity , by gas , by everything you wish , but for the volaille we return always to the old methods . Wood fire . "
47238	47247	47249	47249	he	2231	" Nothing else is worth the old methods , "
47290	47300	47265	47265	he	2231	" The good method of a hundred years since . "
47337	47340	47341	47342	the master	2231	" Yes , "
47352	47373	47341	47342	the master	2231	" It is bizarre , it is a little bizarre , this mixture . But what would you , mademoiselle ? "
47618	47626	47627	47627	he	296	" What is she going to say ? "
47716	47721	47722	47722	she	386	" I must work ! "
47732	47791	47722	47722	she	386	" I must work ! This place makes me ashamed . Ashamed . I wish I could put a pinafore on , and work here , with all these men , instead of going back to that awful restaurant full of greedy rotters . Why ca n't I work ? I must begin my life all over again . "
47797	47835	47722	47722	she	386	" Well , I did start some work this morning , after Smithfield . Oh ! I told you , did n't I ? I swear I will keep it up . Do n't you believe me ? "
47847	47862	47864	47864	Evelyn	290	" Yes , I believe you . Of course you will keep it up , "
47898	47909	47910	47910	she	2281	" There 's no ' of course ' about it , "
47928	47934	47936	47936	Gracie	304	" Oh ! My soufflé ! "
47938	47960	47936	47936	Gracie	304	" It is . I know it is . I 'd forgotten all about it , and you never reminded me ! "
47968	47995	47961	47961	She	304	" Good - bye , maître ! Au revoir . You have been all that is most amiable to us . Thank you . Thank you . "
47996	47999	48006	48006	Her	2281	" But - "
48000	48005	47961	47961	She	304	" Thank you again . "
48051	48055	48056	48056	he	2231	" Too honoured ! "
48141	48149	48138	48138	Evelyn	290	" My soufflé ! It 's gone ! "
48251	48258	48260	48260	Evelyn	290	" That fellow has a nerve ! "
48262	48277	48260	48260	Evelyn	290	" pumping the ingenuous Planquet before my face , and behind my back too ! "
48374	48386	48387	48387	she	304	" But you 're coming upstairs to my little party later , "
48397	48403	48404	48404	she	304	" You coming , daddy ? "
48411	48414	48416	48417	Sir Henry	296	" No , "
48481	48489	48490	48490	Evelyn	290	" I 'm afraid I must n't , "
48862	48874	48875	48875	Gracie	304	" Oh ! But you ca n't say ' No , ' "
48879	48884	48885	48885	Evelyn	290	" Afraid I must , "
48893	48901	48902	48902	he	290	" So many thanks for your hospitality , "
48916	48926	48928	48928	Gracie	304	" But I 've told them you 're coming ! "
48930	48933	48885	48885	Evelyn	290	" Whom ? "
48934	48949	48912	48912	father	9622	" Nancy Penkethman . In my note . I 've promised you to them . "
48957	48986	48950	48950	Evelyn	290	" A young woman as beautiful as you are is entitled to break any promise . I 'm so sorry . Good night . I 'm fearfully sorry . "
48987	48993	48994	48995	Sir Henry	296	" I say , Orcham , "
48999	49002	48885	48885	Evelyn	290	" Yes ? "
49003	49015	48950	48950	Evelyn	290	" You are n't forgetting my message to you this morning ? "
49022	49029	49030	49030	he	290	" Upon my soul I was ! "
49033	49054	49030	49030	he	290	" Old age ! Old age . Do forgive me . You wanted to see me - was n't it ? "
49055	49066	48950	48950	Evelyn	290	" I 'd like to have five minutes some time . "
49067	49074	49076	49076	Evelyn	290	" You and your five minutes ! "
49078	49089	49076	49076	Evelyn	290	" Do you imagine I ca n't see through you ? "
49093	49106	49076	49076	Evelyn	290	" I 'll be delighted if I can be of any use . "
49107	49116	49118	49119	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm busy to - morrow morning , "
49121	49129	49130	49130	Evelyn	290	" And my afternoon 's full up , "
49143	49148	49130	49130	Evelyn	290	" Our Annual Meeting . "
49149	49162	49164	49165	Sir Henry	296	" Oh , really ! Well , there 's no frantic hurry , "
49170	49203	49204	49204	Evelyn	290	" Shall we say day after to - morrow , or the day after that . I shall be here for a few days , might be here for a few weeks . "
49218	49225	49227	49227	Evelyn	290	" It 's coming at last , "
49235	49254	49255	49255	He	290	" As if the man did n't know I knew he knew all about the shareholders ' meeting ! "
49383	49387	49388	49388	he	290	" Anything urgent ? "
49391	49398	49388	49388	he	290	" No , sir . Nothing . "
49734	49740	49711	49711	Monstrous	388	" May I come in ? "
49741	49747	49748	49748	Evelyn	290	" But you are in ! "
49752	49762	49711	49711	Monstrous	388	" Then you do n't want to see me ? "
49763	49771	49711	49711	Monstrous	388	" I 'm delighted to see you . "
49792	49804	49805	49805	she	304	" Now why wo n't you come to my tiny party ? "
49810	49821	49805	49805	she	304	" You are n't working . You 're only smoking . "
49822	49829	49830	49830	he	290	" Yes , I 'm working , "
49833	49852	49830	49830	he	290	" You know , there 's quite a lot of work goes on in this head of mine . "
49893	49903	49904	49904	she	304	" Do you know - I must tell you , "
49907	49930	49904	49904	she	304	" I 'm sure you would prefer me to be straight with you . I must tell you you 're misjudging me . "
49931	49935	49878	49878	she	304	" Misjudging you ? "
49936	50026	50027	50027	She	2340	" Yes . Or you would n't have said what you did about me being so beautiful I was entitled to break any promise . If I am rather good - looking , I ca n't help it . And I loathe the idea that good looks ' entitled ' a girl to behave in a way that a plain girl would n't dare to behave in . I say I loathe it , and I do . I 'm not that sort . I do hope you understand . "
50032	50035	50036	50036	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
50040	50066	50036	50036	Evelyn	290	" Quite . I ought n't to have said it . But I was only joking . I never once thought you were that sort . "
50102	50113	50114	50114	he	290	" But I 've got something to say , too , "
50117	50150	50114	50114	he	290	" Why did you make that promise to your friends without asking me ? I was there while you were writing the note . You might just as easily have asked me . "
50151	50155	50156	50156	she	2342	" I might , "
50180	50242	50174	50174	her	2342	" I ought . But I did n't . I 'm frightfully sorry . It was cheek . But as I 've got myself into a hole , you wo n't leave me in it . You 'll just lift me out of it like a perfect dear . Do n't be a spoiled darling . It would n't suit you . "
50250	50263	50264	50264	he	290	" I ca n't make out why you want me to come , "
50267	50295	50296	50296	Her	2343	" No , of course you ca n't . That 's why you 're such a dear . I want you to come because you 're wonderful . "
50306	50314	50315	50315	he	290	" I 'm not a bit wonderful , "
50318	50356	50378	50378	she	2343	" I know you mean that . But you are n't a judge . I 'm a judge , and I tell you you 're wonderful . And I 'm dying to have you at my party . "
50357	50360	50361	50361	he	290	" Well , "
50434	50434	50430	50430	I	0	"
50772	50784	50785	50785	he	290	" And I 've been thinking these ridiculous thoughts for hours ! "
50808	50850	50851	50851	He	290	" I hope you are n't really dying . I hope you wo n't die : because I honestly ca n't come . I 've got an appointment in ten minutes from now . I should love to come , but - "
50855	50865	50802	50802	He	290	" You do believe me , do n't you ? "
50866	50872	50873	50873	she	2343	" I 'm not sure , "
50879	50911	50873	50873	she	2343	" I 'm terribly suspicious , I ca n't help it , but I 've a feeling you 're treating me the same as you did when we began to dance . "
50912	50917	50802	50802	He	290	" Oh ! How ? "
50918	50937	50873	50873	she	2343	" Holding me off . I 'm more frank than you like , and it makes you afraid . "
51032	51049	51026	51026	his	290	" Come along . Upstairs . The lift ! The lift ! I ca n't wait . "
51349	51358	51359	51359	he	290	" I must ask you to forgive me , "
51371	51380	51381	51381	she	2343	" You 've been very patient with me , "
51393	51397	51381	51381	she	2343	" Good night . "
51398	51402	51403	51403	He	290	" Good night . "
51413	51422	51423	51423	he	290	" I 'll see you to the lift , "
51433	51444	51426	51426	She	2343	" No , please ! I could n't bear that ! "
51511	51525	51501	51501	He	290	" Have I ruined my life ? Was this the turning - point ? "
51766	51858	51752	51752	his	290	" That damned party is still going on . There were pros and cons , but I ought to have accepted the invitation . I was a fool to refuse . It was nothing after all . Only a little improvised party . Surely I was entitled to refuse . Surely she might have taken No for an answer . Her outburst was inexcusable , and it showed what she 's capable of . The damned party is still going on . There were pros and cons , but I ought - "
52510	52515	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Evening , Ted . "
52516	52522	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Good evening , sir . "
52523	52537	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Let me see , how many years have you been with us ? "
52538	52543	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Six , sir . "
52544	52555	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Excellent ! Excellent! ... Ground - floor , please . "
52592	52602	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" When do you come on day - work ? "
52603	52612	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" I hope in five weeks , sir . "
52613	52616	52556	52556	Evelyn	290	" Ah ! "
52631	52637	52639	52639	Ted	391	" Thank you , sir , "
52929	52935	52936	52936	he	290	" Tips ! My God ! "
53008	53014	53015	53017	The three males	2450	" God Save the King . "
53230	53233	53234	53234	Evelyn	290	" Ludovico ! "
53261	53264	53251	53251	Ludovico	392	" Sir ? "
53265	53277	53306	53306	Ludovico	392	" Did Volivia perform first or second in the second cabaret ? "
53278	53301	53251	53251	Ludovico	392	" First , sir . The other turn - clown , I forget his name , sir - refused to appear first . "
53302	53305	53306	53306	Ludovico	392	" Why ? "
53311	53320	53308	53308	his	392	" All right , thanks . Good night . "
53767	53778	53780	53780	Evelyn	290	" Morbid is the word for me to - night , "
54743	54800	54842	54842	He	290	C"te d'Azur . Quite a little banquet before dawn : stirrup cups , no doubt ! What a crew of wastrels ! What untriumphant , repentant mornings they must have ! But he felt excluded by his own act from paradise . He gazed and gazed . A telephone tinkled . He took up the receiver . "
54809	54809	54842	54842	He	290	"
54827	54834	54836	54836	Evelyn	290	" Here , Armand . Telephone , "
55018	55027	55028	55028	Evelyn	290	" What 's it like outside , Sam ? "
55039	55047	55028	55028	Evelyn	290	" Fine , sir . A bit sharp ;
55085	55098	55080	55080	He	290	" I suppose there are no overcoats not working around here anywhere ? "
55099	55107	55080	55080	He	290	" I 'm afraid not , sir . "
55108	55128	55080	55080	He	290	" All right . Never mind . I only thought I 'd go out for a minute or two . "
55129	55147	55148	55148	He	291	" Have mine , sir . May be on the small side , mais a la rigueur - "
55184	55189	55191	55191	Reyer	291	" Not too bad , "
55215	55218	55220	55220	Evelyn	290	" Splendid ! "
55516	55522	55510	55511	simple provincials	2601	" What 's that thing ? "
55528	55538	55510	55511	simple provincials	2601	" That ? That 's the Imperial Palace Hotel . "
55740	55748	55749	55749	he	290	" What a damned fool I am ! "
55752	55820	55749	55749	he	290	" Why the devil am I so down ? I do n't care twopence about the confounded girl . Am I , the hotel - world - famous Evelyn Orcham , to go running around like a boy after a girl ? It 's undignified . And I do n't mind who she is , or what she is ! Anyway I 've taught her a lesson ! "
56049	56053	56054	56054	he	291	" Much obliged , "
56074	56081	56083	56083	Reyer	291	" Not at all , sir , "
56087	56094	56095	56095	Reyer	291	" That the night - book ? "
56109	56129	56102	56102	He	291	" Three ladies and two gentlemen left No . 365 at 3.5 . One of them was Lady Devizes . "
56133	56157	56130	56130	Evelyn	290	" She 's by herself now . Perhaps her maid is undressing her . She must be terribly exhausted , poor little thing . "
56164	56170	56171	56171	he	290	" My floor , please , "
56431	56467	56425	56425	she	2639	" I 'm up late . I 'll stay up , and catch the first train . That will give me two hours less in his ghastly hotel , and two hours more in Paris . "
56937	56945	56947	56948	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Can you give me one minute ? "
56989	56992	56994	56994	Evelyn	290	" Two , "
57027	57041	57043	57044	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" I think I 've found someone to take Miss Brury 's place , "
57049	57067	57043	57044	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" She 's young , but she 's had experience , and - she 's a gentlewoman . "
57068	57073	57075	57075	Evelyn	290	" That 's good , "
57482	57495	57496	57497	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Perhaps you would like to have just a look at her ? "
57500	57506	57507	57507	he	290	" Yes , I should , "
57510	57541	57507	57507	he	290	" But you can take her references and have everything ready in the meantime . Only do n't clinch it . I have someone in mind myself for the job . "
57564	57570	57571	57571	she	339	" Oh , of course , "
57577	57583	57571	57571	she	339	" If that 's it - "
57584	57589	57590	57590	Evelyn	290	" Not at all ! "
57598	57626	57590	57590	Evelyn	290	" You go on with yours , and we 'll see . I should n't be a bit surprised if yours is far more suitable than mine . "
57627	57637	57638	57639	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Is she a gentlewoman , may I ask ? "
57648	57670	57642	57642	Evelyn	290	" That depends on what you call a gentlewoman . She 's had what I should call a very good education . "
57671	57676	57590	57590	Evelyn	290	" But her people ? "
57677	57685	57642	57642	Evelyn	290	" Her father 's a great traveller . "
57695	57701	57686	57686	Evelyn	290	" A town - traveller . "
57707	57710	57717	57717	she	339	" Oh ! "
57806	57816	57817	57817	he	290	" Well , I shall be hearing from you , "
57979	57985	57987	57987	Evelyn	290	" This interview is unofficial , "
58289	58305	58306	58306	Evelyn	290	" The matter is in the hands of Mrs. O'Riordan , our head - housekeeper , "
58310	58357	58306	58306	Evelyn	290	" I 've really nothing to do with it . But I thought I 'd better find out first whether you thought the job would suit you . We want a new floor - housekeeper here . There are eight Floors and eight floor - housekeepers . "
58538	58551	58552	58552	he	2720	" It really all comes down to a question of human relations , "
58555	58622	58623	58623	He	2720	" I 'm quite sure you could manage the chambermaids excellently . They 're the same class as our laundry - maids , and you know them . But the visitors are a very different proposition , and quite as difficult . And partly for the same reason . The supply of chambermaids is not equal to the demand . Neither is the supply of guests . "
58641	58647	58649	58649	she	353	" You mean , sir , "
58659	58680	58649	58649	she	353	" I 've been used to being given in to , and with guests I should have to give in . "
58696	58707	58708	58708	he	2720	" Not give in , only seem to give in , "
58712	58871	58708	58708	he	2720	" Say a bedroom 's cold because the visitor has n't had the sense to turn on the radiator . Well you turn it on , and fiddle about with it , and then admit that there was something wrong with it , but you 've put it right , and if it is n't right you 'll send a man up to see to it . Then just before you leave you say : ' These radiators are rather peculiar ' - they are n't - ' may I show you how they turn on ? ' You 've won , but the guest thinks she 's won . It 's always a she . No . That 's not fair . It is n't always a she . Mrs. O'Riordan says there 's nobody more exasperating than a New York stockbroker all strung up after five days ' strenuous business life at sea in a liner . "
58876	59058	58872	58872	Violet	353	" It appears that American men are super - sensitive to the bugle - calls in the mornings . Wellington Barracks next door , you know . Those bugles ca n't be explained away . They 'd wake Pharaoh in his pyramid . I 've thought of keeping a graph to show the curve of explosions of temper due to those bugles . Probably about half a dozen a week . Well , you always say that the bugles were unusually loud that morning ; you 've never heard them so loud before ; and that I 'm negotiating with the War Office to get them done away with . I 'm not of course . But it soothes the awakened , especially if you admit that the bugles are absolutely inexcusable . As they are . Put them in the right , and they 'll eat out of your hand , visitors will . If you argue you 're lost . So 's the hotel . Now I 've given you a sort of general idea . What about it ? "
59059	59066	59068	59068	Violet	353	" I should like to try , "
59072	59087	59068	59068	Violet	353	" I often have to do much the same with my laundry - maids . "
59091	59098	59099	59099	Violet	353	" If I may say so , "
59102	59108	59110	59110	Evelyn	290	" I think you may , "
59116	59131	59132	59132	He	290	" She 's all right . But I 'd better not be too funny . "
59139	59149	59132	59132	He	290	" Then I 'll mention you to Mrs. O'Riordan . "
59150	59168	59170	59170	Violet	353	" Thank you , sir . I 'm very much obliged to you for thinking of me , "
59176	59189	59132	59132	He	290	" Of course there would have to be a period of training . "
59190	59199	59132	59132	He	290	" Yes , sir . I understand that . "
59200	59234	59132	59132	He	290	" But in your case it ought n't to be long ... In your place I would n't say a word at the Laundry . Mrs. O'Riordan might have somebody else she prefers . "
59235	59243	59244	59244	Violet	353	" No , sir . Of course . "
59257	59281	59250	59250	Her	353	" You are n't going to tell me that this Mrs. O'Riordan will refuse anyone that 's been mentioned to her by you . "
59338	59360	59361	59361	He	290	" I happened to see you talking to Sir Henry Savott in the hall . Then you know the great man ? "
59386	59480	59481	59481	Violet	353	" Well , sir . I know him , if you call it knowing . He came up to me - in the hall . My sister was his housekeeper , at a house he had at Claygate - he sold it afterwards . My sister was ill in the house , and as I happened to be free , I was engaged to do her work , for a month . Of course I could see my sister every day , and she kept me right . I could always ask her . "
59496	59523	59493	59493	She	353	" It 's a small world ; but I 've heard it said you meet everyone in the hall of this hotel , sooner or later . "
59534	59541	59543	59543	Evelyn	290	" But this is very interesting , "
59574	59583	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Then you do know something of housekeeping ? "
59584	59615	59524	59524	She	353	" A little , sir . I think I managed it all right . But of course , as I say , I had my sister to tell me things . "
59616	59621	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" A large staff ? "
59622	59643	59524	59524	She	353	" About forty , sir - indoor and outdoor . My sister had charge of everything , indoor and outdoor . "
59644	59652	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Then you had charge of everything ? "
59653	59664	59524	59524	She	353	" Yes , sir . But my sister was there . "
59665	59672	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Sir Henry entertained a lot ? "
59673	59689	59690	59690	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir . A very great deal , and often without warning us . "
59709	59727	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" You did n't say anything about this , I see , when you came to us . "
59728	59734	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Oh no , sir . "
59735	59748	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" I suppose you did n't count it as a regular engagement . "
59749	59777	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" No , sir . And it was so short . But if I had asked him I think Sir Henry would have given me a testimonial . "
59778	59784	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Was Lady Savott there ? "
59785	59791	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Oh no , sir . "
59803	59811	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" I 've never seen her ladyship . "
59812	59826	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Then you left , and your sister took on the work again . "
59827	59836	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , sir , for a bit . "
59837	59843	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" She left . No ? "
59844	59852	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" My sister is dead , sir . "
59853	59856	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Oh ! "
59863	59870	59857	59857	Evelyn	290	" She was older than you ? "
59871	59882	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , sir . Five years . Nearly six . "
59883	59891	59857	59857	Evelyn	290	" Did she die in the house ? "
59892	59936	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" No , sir . After she 'd left . Sir Henry asked me to go back . But I was very comfortable at the Laundry then . So I did n't go . I do n't believe much in chopping and changing . "
59937	59945	59857	59857	Evelyn	290	" Quite . You know Miss Gracie ? "
59946	59951	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , sir . "
59952	59960	59857	59857	Evelyn	290	" She was living in the house ? "
59961	59967	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Oh yes , sir . "
59968	59978	59857	59857	Evelyn	290	" An extraordinary young lady , is n't she ? "
59979	59984	59568	59569	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , sir , "
60423	60437	60420	60421	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" My discovery , Miss Powler ! Not yours , mother . Mine ! "
60452	60456	60457	60457	he	2734	" You know , "
60464	60483	60457	60457	he	2734	" there 'd be one thing , rather important , if you do n't mind my mentioning it - "
60484	60487	60508	60508	his	2734	" Please . "
60488	60499	60500	60500	He	2734	" If you do come here - powder and rouge . "
60674	60683	60684	60684	he	2734	" And that Gracie girl liked my shoulders , "
60754	60762	60764	60765	Miss Powler	353	" Yes , of course , sir , "
60767	60787	60764	60765	Miss Powler	353	" To tell the truth , I 'd thought of that . It would be part of the business . "
60788	60799	60728	60728	Gracie	297	" They 'd put you up to all that here . "
60800	60817	60764	60765	Miss Powler	353	" Yes , sir . If necessary . But I know something about make - up . "
60818	60821	60822	60822	Evelyn	290	" Oh ? "
60826	60863	60764	60765	Miss Powler	353	" Well , sir . You see . Our amateur dramatic society . I 've had to make up plenty of girls . They love it . And I 've had to make up myself too . "
60868	60872	60873	60873	Evelyn	290	" Of course ! "
60876	60882	60873	60873	Evelyn	290	" I was forgetting that . "
60924	60933	60934	60934	she	353	" It would hardly do at the Laundry , "
60937	60967	60934	60934	she	353	" I should n't like it there . Not but what a lot of the laundry - maids themselves do make up . But here I might like it . "
61315	61322	61323	61324	Mr. Dover	399	" Outpost in the enemy country ! "
61555	61569	61570	61570	Dover	399	" Morning , Dacker . Fine December fog to - day , eh ? "
61596	61610	61582	61582	Dacker	404	" Good morning , Mr. Dover . Yes , a fine December fog . "
61639	61654	61611	61612	Mr. Dover	399	" Young man , men have been shot at dawn for less than that . "
61676	61695	61673	61674	Mr. Smiss	407	" Now , you lily - livered , have some brandy , for your hour is at hand . "
61819	61827	61829	61830	Dennis Dover	399	" Obey your venerable chairman , gentlemen , "
61863	61921	61850	61851	Mr. Lingmell	405	" Your alarm does you credit , seeing that you wo n't have to speechify at the meeting and that you hold no shares worth mentioning , and that if the Palace goes to pot the ancient prestige of the Palace will set forty hotels fighting for your services ... To the Resolution ! To the Resolution ! "
62696	62716	62684	62684	his	399	" You do n't mind me referring to the colour of your livers , boys ? Sign of affection . "
63490	63502	63480	63481	father Dennis	399	" The secretary will kindly read the notice convening the meeting . "
63559	63564	63565	63565	he	399	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
63572	63577	63579	63579	Evelyn	290	" We 're off ! "
63666	63873	63655	63655	He	414	" Figures speak louder than loud - speakers . I am sure that you have all studied our figures with that impartial conscientiousness which distinguishes all good shareholders . I need not therefore weary you with information of which you are already in full possession . I will merely remark , as much for my own satisfaction as for yours , that last year was a record year in the Company 's history , that our net trading profit after deducting fixed dividend on preference shares , debenture interest and sinking - fund charges , was equivalent to twenty and a half per cent . on our ordinary capital , and that we propose to declare a final dividend making fourteen per cent . per annum , for the year , instead of last year 's eleven per cent . , and incidentally I will point out that we are allotting L75,000 to our reserve fund , instead of last year 's L60,000 . I move the adoption of the accounts and the payment of the dividend as recommended , and I call upon Mr. Evelyn Orcham , our managing director and orator , who will be less summary than myself , to second the motion . "
63891	63908	63876	63876	he	2913	" You can put that in your pipes and smoke it ; and go to hell . "
64215	64220	64221	64221	he	2913	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
64224	64227	64221	64221	he	2913	" Your hotels "
64233	64511	64230	64230	his	2913	" Your hotels ? Good God ! They are n't your hotels . You could n't have started them . You could n't run them . You do n't understand them . You 've no idea what wonderful , romantic things they are . You know nothing about them , except a few arithmetical symbols which I choose to offer you and which are beyond your comprehension . You did n't buy shares because you are interested in hotels ; only because you believed that you could squeeze a bit of money out of them . Whereas ' your ' hotels are my creation . I live for them . I have a passion for them . Without me they would be hotels , common hotels , not the hotels . If I left them , as I could , your precious dividends would diminish and might disappear . ' Your ' hotels are mine , and if you denied this I could prove it to you quick enough . Ignoramuses ! Is any one of you aware , for instance , that at this moment I am wondering how the devil I can entice my customers in my restaurant and my grill - room to consume more than a dozen and a half champagne per hundred covers ? Does any one of you guess that in my opinion an average of one - sixth of a bottle of champagne per person dining or lunching is a shockingly low average - especially considering the qualities of my champagne ? Not one of you ! Barbarians ! Benighted savages ! Unworthy of respect ! ' Your ' hotels ! "
64527	64571	64519	64519	he	2928	" Your hotels , thanks entirely to the willing and generous co - operation which the Board has received from you in supporting us in a policy of large annual expenditure in order to keep your establishments abreast or in front of the times "
64573	64582	64583	64583	he	2928	" This sentence is getting out of hand , "
64586	64593	64583	64583	he	2928	" I 'd better kill it . "
64595	64623	64625	64625	he	2928	" your hotels , I say , have passed through an extremely difficult year not without credit . I will first of all refer to the difficulties . "
64813	64817	64819	64819	he	2928	" In conclusion , "
64821	65074	64819	64819	he	2928	" I should like to refer to one point . Your hotels , and particularly the Imperial Palace , have been called dear - in their charges . I resent the word , and I think that you will resent it . They are expensive ; but dear they are not . We try to give , and I claim that we do give , better value for money than any other hotel in this country . And the proof that the public shares this opinion lies in the undoubted fact that the public is patronising your hotels more and more . The public can not be deceived for long . Many hotels have attempted to deceive it , and they have failed to do so . We - I mean everybody present when I say ' we ' - have not attempted to deceive it . I am sure that you , the shareholders , would never agree to a policy of pretending to the public that your hotels are what they are not . We maintain that they are the most luxurious and efficient in the world , and that their charges are as low as is consistent with the desire for perfection which animates us all . Ladies and gentlemen , I thank you for the patience with which you have listened to my halting remarks - our ironic Chairman ought not to have dubbed me ' orator ' - and I have great pleasure in seconding the motion . "
65092	65097	65099	65099	Evelyn	290	" Good old platitudes ! "
65134	65151	65153	65153	Evelyn	290	" And these people in front will go home feeling that they 've done thing important ! "
65160	65168	65155	65156	The Chairman	2812	" Any questions , ladies and gentlemen ? "
65579	65604	65573	65574	the Chairman	2812	" The proceedings of the Ordinary General Meeting being now terminated , the Secretary will kindly read the notice convening the Special General Meeting . "
65605	65612	65614	65614	Evelyn	290	" Now we really are off ! "
65647	65715	65716	65716	he	414	" The meeting will I hope pardon me if I refer to a purely personal matter . I am suffering to - day from rather serious throat - trouble , and my medical adviser , in whom I have as much confidence as a sane man can have in a medical adviser insisted that I should make only one speech - and that as short as possible , "
66860	66947	66856	66857	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" Ladies and gentlemen , I shall not detain you long . Need I say that I share the sentiments expressed by your Vice - chairman . At the same time I think that - patriot as he is , and a man of imagination , something of the artist in him , no one can be the great organiser Mr. Orcham is without having a large amount of imagination - he has perhaps not quite sufficiently stressed the strictly practical business side of this proposal . "
67116	67343	67112	67113	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" We are all men and women of business here , and we are all patriots , and anxious if possible and fair to ourselves to keep British commercial enterprises in British hands . But patriotism is a burden , and in common justice the burden ought to be equally shared among the citizens . Your shares stand on the Stock Exchange round about thirty - five shillings - in my opinion decidedly below their real value . Supposing a group of foreign interests - say American , purely as an illustration - came along and offered you fifty - five shillings a share , as might well happen . Patriotism might urge you to refuse , but in refusing you would be throwing away something like two and a half million pounds , you , a comparatively small body of citizens . The loss in actual cash would not be shared equally by the electorate , it would fall exclusively on you . Would this be fair ? It would not , and I should be rather surprised if your Vice - chairman did not say the same . The suggestion would be monstrous . No reasonable person could make such a demand on you . Let us look facts in the face . You would accept the offer , and you would be right . "
67352	67496	67112	67113	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" And another thing . True , the magnificent Imperial Palace and Wey hotels would be lost to British control . But the wealth of Great Britain would have been increased by two and a half million pounds and you would have at your absolute disposal the total purchase money , between six and seven million pounds , for reinvestment in British industry and commerce under British control . It seems to me clear that if the - purely hypothetical - offer were actually made , the truest patriotism and the most far - seeing business sagacity would accept the offer . Your Company might cease to exist , but it is necessary to take a broad view , and in the broad view British industry and commerce as a whole would gain a considerable advantage . Bad business is never good patriotism . "
67508	67514	67515	67516	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" I have nearly finished , "
67519	67722	67515	67516	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" But not quite . I have spoken of an offer , purely hypothetical as I say . Can an offer so handsome ever materialise ? It never could materialise if the prospective buyers of your undertaking first obtained control of the Imperial Palace Company by quietly getting hold of a majority of the shares , which as things stand would mean a majority vote at a General Meeting . If by this means any prospective buyers first obtained control they would be sellers as well as buyers , and they would sell to themselves at any price they chose to name , and those of you who had kept your shares would find yourselves between the upper and nether millstones . You would get left . The Resolution before the meeting will , if you pass it , prevent this quite possible ramp . For these reasons , if you ask my advice - not otherwise - I should advise you to vote for the Resolution . Let me say that I am entirely disinterested . I hold no shares in your Company , or in any of the many companies which do me the honour to employ my professional services . "
67761	67767	67769	67769	Evelyn	290	" Talk about an artist ! "
67771	67841	67769	67769	Evelyn	290	" This fellow is a finished artist . I can manage a hotel . But this fellow has shown me that I do n't know the first thing about handling shareholders . Makes a good effect first by pretending to disagree with me . Then simply rolls them all up . Damned clever of him not to tell the Board beforehand exactly what line he was going to take ! "
67870	67874	67876	67877	father Dennis	414	" Any observations ? "
67880	67899	67876	67877	father Dennis	414	" The Board will be glad to have the views of shareholders , and to answer any questions . "
67932	68027	67906	67910	a little , scrubby man	3030	" With great respect for the wisdom of the Board , and giving full weight to the opinions which have been so ably expressed by the Vice - chairman and my friend the Company 's solicitor , I venture to differ from them as to the advisability of passing this most drastic and even revolutionary Resolution . I may say that I am not without experience in the management of public companies , as my friend Mr. Levinsohn knows . My experience has taught me that ownership ought never to be divorced from control - "
68044	68058	68041	68042	Mr. Levinsohn	400	" Who is your friend ? How many shares does he hold ? D.D. "
68085	68104	68106	68106	Levinsohn	400	" Dickingham , a solicitor . Probably one of Savott 's nominees and speaking for all of them , "
68120	68128	68116	68117	Mr. Crump	412	" 1,500 . Bought six months ago . "
68133	68147	68148	68148	He	417	" This Resolution , if carried , would obviously divorce ownership from control . "
68157	68373	68148	68148	He	417	" If you pass the Resolution , you will be entirely in the hands of the Board . Large shareholders will have no power . And it is well known that the average small shareholder always supports his Board . I make no reflection upon the small shareholder . I am one myself , and I make no doubt that there are many here . As a rule the small shareholder is right to support his Board . But the result will be the same , whatever his motives : an autocracy of the Board , an autocracy which will last as long as the Board chooses it shall last . If a similar Resolution to this could be translated into politics - which happily for our national welfare it can not - and put before the House of Commons as a measure of electoral reform , it would be laughed out of the House by every political party . In fact no political party would dare to introduce such a measure , were such a measure conceivable . I admit that it is not . The principle which has made the Empire what it is is the principle of control going hand in hand with ownership . The Resolution would abolish control by ownership . "
68385	68441	68374	68375	The speaker	2994	" There is a proverb : ' Where your treasure is , there is your heart also . ' I beg you , ladies and gentlemen , to think of all that that wisdom means . I feel that at this moment the fortunes of the Imperial Palace Hotel Company are trembling in the balance . "
68490	68504	68484	68484	himself	414	" I have the pleasure to put the Resolution . Those in favour - "
68510	68534	68481	68482	Father Dennis	414	" The Resolution appears to be carried . But of course , if any of you would prefer a poll to be taken - "
68535	68542	68544	68547	a number of voices	3037	" Poll ! Poll ! Poll ! "
68553	68558	68544	68547	a number of voices	3037	" Poll ! Poll ! "
68593	68626	68586	68587	Mr. Dickingham	417	" Mr. Chairman , if you will permit me to suggest it , I should like to examine the proxies - of course in collaboration with my friend the Company 's solicitor . "
68627	68635	68637	68638	father Dennis	414	" I have not the smallest objection , "
68835	68845	68831	68832	father Dennis	414	" Shareholders now kindly substantiate their claims to vote . "
68940	68953	68954	68954	he	2812	" The Resolution is carried , by a majority of 22,111 votes , "
68964	68970	68954	68954	he	2812	" Ownership has exercised control . "
68971	68977	68979	68980	Mr. Dickingham	417	" For the last time , "
68989	68994	68996	68997	the Chairman	2812	" An improper observation , "
69001	69012	69014	69015	Mr. Dickingham	417	" I am sorry you should think so , sir , "
69021	69110	69014	69015	Mr. Dickingham	417	" And I will point out to those shareholders who do not know it that you closed the Transfer books a month ago , and I understand will keep them closed until after the confirmatory meeting a fortnight hence . You have thus prevented new genuine holders of shares from voting at this meeting or the next . If it had not been for this piece of sharp practice , probably illegal , your Resolution would have been lost to - day , and well you know it ! "
69121	69150	69152	69152	he	414	" The Board followed a perfectly normal procedure in closing the Transfer books . They acted within their rights . And they certainly did their duty . This gentleman "
69161	69233	69152	69152	he	414	" is a lawyer . He is therefore aware that this is not the proper place to raise a legal question . There are the Law Courts . May I remind you , ladies and gentlemen , of the statutory Special General Meeting a fortnight hence for the purpose of formally confirming the Resolution which you have been good enough to pass to - day . The proceedings are now terminated . "
69252	69258	69259	69259	he	400	" Good afternoon , Dover , "
69265	69274	69259	69259	he	400	" I have another meeting at four o'clock . "
69520	69525	69528	69529	Dennis Dover	399	" Rather a lark ! "
69541	69544	69528	69529	Dennis Dover	399	" What ? "
69545	69561	69562	69562	He	399	" Savott wandering about the hotel while all this has been going on . Eh ? "
69579	69582	69562	69562	He	399	" said Evelyn .
69583	69592	69594	69596	the old man	2687	" You may bet your shirt he does ! "
69844	69859	69861	69861	Evelyn	290	" We must have that Board meeting to - morrow to elect our chairman , "
69872	69877	69879	69880	father Dennis	414	" I reminded Lingmell , "
69882	69909	69879	69880	father Dennis	414	" Noon , is n't it ? But he wo n't come . Does n't matter . There 'll be a quorum without the old ruffian . "
69940	69950	69972	69972	his	3078	" I was just waiting for you , sir . "
69951	69955	69972	69972	his	3078	" Want anything ? "
69956	69966	69972	69972	his	3078	" No , sir . I thought you might . "
69982	69987	69989	69989	Evelyn	290	" No . Nothing , "
69991	70009	69989	69989	Evelyn	290	" I 'm going to have my tea upstairs . I 'll be down at five again . "
70010	70015	70016	70016	Dacker	408	" Yes , sir . "
70022	70044	70016	70016	Dacker	408	" You are entitled to your retreat on this magnificent occasion . In your absence I shall watch over your interests . "
70058	70087	70088	70088	He	3078	" Get hold of Oldham , will you , please , and ask him to bring me my tea here . The Darjeeling , tell him . Thanks . "
70254	70273	70244	70244	he	329	" I 've brought you some hot ry - vita in case you should fancy it , sir . "
70274	70280	70244	70244	he	329	" Thanks , I shall . "
70281	70287	70244	70244	he	329	" Thank you , sir . "
70370	70387	70367	70367	Evelyn	290	" What have I done to win all this loyalty ? I do n't deserve it . "
70815	70852	70811	70811	Evelyn	290	" I say , supposing we alter our date ? Come and dine with me to - night in my secret castle upstairs , if you 're free . We shall be more at home there , "
70859	70880	70854	70855	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm not free . But I 'll get free . Eight - thirty ? Would that suit you ? "
70966	70978	70980	70981	Sir Henry	296	" Very nice of you to have me escorted up here , "
71001	71004	71006	71006	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
71008	71024	71006	71006	Evelyn	290	" it 's a little withdrawn , my castle . Have a glass of sherry ? "
71025	71038	71039	71040	Sir Henry	296	" If I might have one of your ' soft ' cocktails , "
71043	71046	71047	71047	Evelyn	290	" Two , "
71091	71100	71102	71102	Evelyn	290	" I see I 'm behind the times , "
71133	71138	71118	71118	he	296	" That 's better . "
71186	71442	71183	71183	Evelyn	290	" After all , why should n't I have him up here ? Shows him who I am , and that I 'm not suspicious of him , do n't want to hold him off , as I held off his strange daughter - so she said ! Fact is I can handle him better up here than down in my office . He 's thinking already I 'm going to fall for him . I do n't like his teeth , but he 's a lot more agreeable to - day than he was yesterday . He 's damned civil . Is it all put on for my benefit ? No . Could n't be . There 's something about him that rather appeals to me . His tone . His eye . A shade too small , his eye , but - He may be quite all right . And I do n't care a curse what his reputation is . Do n't I always say you ought to take people as you find them ? He may be a thoroughly decent fellow . Well , then ! After all , it is n't a sin to want to buy the Imperial Palace . Anybody 's entitled to try . And anybody 's entitled to lay hold of all the shares he can before he starts to bargain . Childish to bear him a grudge . And if he imagines he can get the better of me - well , we shall see . "
71462	71472	71474	71475	Sir Henry	296	" I really must congratulate you on your castle , "
71480	71483	71485	71485	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
71487	71516	71485	71485	Evelyn	290	" one does what one can to be comfortable . No reason , is there , why I should make any visitor more comfortable than I make myself ? "
71517	71522	71559	71559	Oldham	329	" You 're right . "
71586	71596	71598	71599	Sir Henry	296	" They understand food and drink in your castle , "
71601	71606	71608	71608	Evelyn	290	" As to that , "
71610	71638	71608	71608	Evelyn	290	" I 'll tell you my motto : Plain , and as perfect as you can get it . I hope it has n't been too plain . "
71639	71644	71646	71647	Sir Henry	296	" Could n't be , "
71786	71794	71795	71795	Evelyn	290	" Shall we sit by the fire ? "
71807	71815	71795	71795	Evelyn	290	" It 's getting time he began . "
71837	71843	71845	71845	Evelyn	290	" This is very pleasant , "
71913	71922	71924	71924	Evelyn	290	" Tranquillity , the hush before wild weather , "
71926	71940	71942	71942	Evelyn	290	" I saw from the departure list that Miss Gracie has left us , "
71954	71957	71959	71960	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , "
71965	71992	71959	71960	Sir Henry	296	" Yesterday morning . Gone to Paris with Lady Devizes and one of the Cheddars . Decided it all in a minute , as they do . "
72001	72017	72018	72018	he	296	" Woke me up to tell me she was off . Girls are a problem , "
72022	72064	72018	72018	he	296	" Only thing to do is to leave them alone . At least that 's my conclusion . Most of them are fools , if you ask me . But Gracie is n't . How did she strike you , Orcham ? "
72065	72068	72070	72070	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
72079	72114	72070	72070	Evelyn	290	" I hardly know her . But I should say she 's about as far from being a fool as any young woman I ever met . I certainly never met one more intelligent . "
72120	72135	72115	72116	Sir Henry	296	" Quite . But do we want a lot of intelligence in a woman ? "
72136	72139	72018	72018	he	296	" Yes . "
72140	72158	72159	72160	Sir Henry	296	" I suppose we do . Yes , you 're right , we do ... We do . "
72166	72172	72173	72173	Evelyn	290	" And as for beauty - "
72176	72180	72182	72183	Sir Henry	296	" You know , "
72186	72201	72182	72183	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm her father and all that . But Gracie really is extraordinary . "
72202	72208	72018	72018	he	296	" I can believe it . "
72209	72307	72182	72183	Sir Henry	296	" She 's given up motor - racing . Perhaps she was right . But it would have been just the same if she had n't been right . She 's taken to literature now . Writes . Naturally she would n't show me anything . Reads nothing but Shakspere and the Bible . Very strong on the Psalms . You 'd never guess what she thinks is the finest thing in the Bible . She quotes it to me . ' Be still , and know that I am God . ' Forty - sixth Psalm . "
72313	72340	72341	72341	He	296	" I 'm dashed if I understand just what it means , but you know , it sticks in your mind . Mystical , I reckon . "
72344	72378	72341	72341	He	296	" I 've been thinking about it ever since . What does it mean ? It means something to her . I expect you think I 'm making a noise like a father . "
72446	72449	72450	72450	he	296	" Perhaps , "
72455	72476	72450	72450	he	296	" Perhaps , we are n't still enough . Never occurred to me before , but perhaps we are n't . "
72600	72605	72606	72607	Sir Henry	296	" Well , well ! "
72703	72714	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" I met a friend of mine here yesterday morning . "
72715	72718	73009	73009	he	296	" Oh ? "
72719	72738	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" When I say ' friend ' I mean I know her . A girl named Violet Powler . "
72739	72742	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
72746	72766	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" I noticed you talking to her in the hall . She 's staff - manageress in my Laundry . "
72767	72773	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" So she told me . "
72774	72788	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" I 'm thinking of taking her on here . What about her ? "
72789	72805	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" Oh ! Nothing . Only she 's a first - rater , Violet is . "
72806	72831	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" She said she 'd been acting for a time as your housekeeper at - I forget where . Claygate , did she say ? "
72832	72896	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" Yes . It was while her sister was ill . Those two sisters were wonderful . It 's a positive fact that inside twenty - four hours Violet had picked up the entire job . I never saw anything like it . Never ! I tried to get her back again ; but she would n't come . I gave up trying . "
72897	72920	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" Why would n't she ? I should have thought it was a much better situation than anything I could offer her . "
72921	72976	72699	72700	Sir Henry	296	" Perhaps it was . But of course I do n't know how good your situations are . I know I 'd have given her practically any salary she cared to ask . I would n't like to say whether Violet or Susan was the best of the two . Susan was the eldest . "
72977	72984	72744	72744	Evelyn	290	" Died , did n't she ? "
72985	72989	72991	72992	Sir Henry	296	" She did , "
73013	73024	73009	73009	he	296	" When I tell you I very nearly married Susan - "
73028	73031	73033	73033	Evelyn	290	" Well ! "
73044	73064	73033	73033	Evelyn	290	" If Susan actually was anything like Violet , that 's the best thing I ever heard about you ! "
73165	73168	73169	73169	he	296	" Really ! "
73330	73335	73337	73338	Sir Henry	296	" My private affairs , "
73340	73365	73337	73338	Sir Henry	296	" used to fill a lot of space in the newspapers . So I daresay you know more about them than I do myself . "
73382	73592	73378	73378	his	296	" It was before I got free of Lady Savott that I wanted to come to an understanding with Susan . But she was so afraid she 'd be mixed up in the divorce proceedings , and I could n't make her see she would n't be , could n't possibly be . You know if a woman does n't see a thing for herself you ca n't reason her into seeing it . No . She would n't give even a provisional consent . Did n't like the idea of it . And when I was free it was just too late . I did everything I could to save her life . Everything ... She was on my side right enough against Lady Savott . She knew the facts . She 'd seen 'em . It was seeing Violet yesterday that brought it all back to me . Funny , I do n't know to this day whether Violet knew how things were between her sister and me ! I doubt whether Susan ever said a word to a soul . Tremendously reserved ; and as for discretion! ... Excuse me boring you . It came over me , all of a sudden . Well , well ! "
73796	73809	73792	73792	he	290	" I bet it has n't prevented him from amusing himself since . "
73810	73815	73817	73818	Sir Henry	296	" Now look here ! "
73835	73848	73817	73818	Sir Henry	296	" I 've not come here to make a nuisance of myself . "
73849	73854	73855	73855	Evelyn	290	" Not at all , "
73859	73868	73869	73870	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , yes . A damned nuisance ! "
73877	73904	73869	73870	Sir Henry	296	" I 've come here to try to do a bit of business , anyhow to begin it . You know what it is of course . "
73905	73911	73913	73913	Evelyn	290	" What I do know , "
73915	73938	73913	73913	Evelyn	290	" is that whether you intended it or not , you and I 'll never be on a purely business footing again . "
73959	73962	73964	73965	Sir Henry	296	" Now , "
73995	74100	73985	73985	Evelyn	290	" I want you to believe that I have nothing whatever to conceal from you . If I tried to conceal anything from a man like you , I know I should n't succeed - for long . You know too much about your business , and you 're far too clever . Do n't think I 'm flattering you . I 'm not . And what 's more , you must know I 'm not . You must know very well that in your own line you 're the first man in the world . Now do n't you ? Honest to God ! "
74101	74113	74115	74115	Evelyn	290	" There are one or two pretty fine men in Germany , "
74117	74130	73985	73985	Evelyn	290	" Do you think they are equal to you ? Do you ? "
74150	74163	74164	74164	he	290	" Do you wish to make me talk like a conceited ass ? "
74171	74187	74131	74131	Evelyn	290	" No . I wish you to answer a question . Yes , or no ? "
74205	74231	74131	74131	Evelyn	290	" How can I tell ? How do I know whether the German fellows are n't equal to me ? I 'm an interested party . "
74232	74268	74131	74131	Evelyn	290	" Of course you 're an interested party . But I 'm not asking you what you know . I 'm asking you what you think . You have an opinion . What is it ? "
74269	74282	74131	74131	Evelyn	290	" Well , I do n't think they are equal to me . "
74283	74291	74293	74294	Sir Henry	296	" Confession is good for the soul , "
74307	74316	74317	74317	Evelyn	290	" I 'm not so sure about that , "
74320	74344	74317	74317	Evelyn	290	" And why does he use these worn - out phrases ? ' Confession is good for the soul ! ' Good God ! "
74345	74347	74349	74350	Sir Henry	296	" Thanks "
74352	74359	74349	74350	Sir Henry	296	" May I have another cigar ? "
74407	74419	74420	74420	Evelyn	290	" He does n't know a lot about cigar - smoking , "
74423	74450	74420	74420	Evelyn	290	" He 's got that cigar too hot right at the start . And he 's finished one already , and mine 's only half through . "
74451	74454	74456	74457	Sir Henry	296	" Well , "
74481	74590	74473	74473	Evelyn	290	" So far so good . Well , as I say , I 'm going to be perfectly open with you . That is n't always my way in big negotiations . But it 's my way this time , because I feel it 'll be the best way with you . No other reason . No question of moral principle and so on . Candour is n't necessarily the best policy . It often is n't , by Jove . But in this case it is . I reckon myself a very good judge of character . You can appreciate frankness , because you are n't sentimental . "
74591	74596	74598	74598	Evelyn	290	" That 's true , "
74604	74634	74598	74598	Evelyn	290	" He is a bit of a judge of character . And he 's devilish different tonight from the man who stood me a dinner the night before last . "
74662	74730	74655	74655	He	290	" I 'll tell you something possibly you do n't know . Let me mention a few hotels . For instance , the Majestic in London , your only serious rival , and the Duncannon in London . The Concorde and the Montaigne in Paris . The Minerva at Cannes . The Escurial in Madrid . The Bottecini at San Remo . The Albergo Umberto in Rome . "
74731	74736	74655	74655	He	290	" That 's eight . "
74737	74747	74655	74655	He	290	" Yes . What do you think of them ? "
74748	74754	74756	74756	Evelyn	290	" Not a bad selection , "
74759	74765	74756	74756	Evelyn	290	" Fairly representative Very fairly . "
74958	74972	74955	74955	his	290	" Mr. Evelyn Orcham , Managing Director , Imperial Palace Hotel , London . "
75011	75021	75023	75024	Sir Henry	296	" I now have control of all the eight , "
75057	75101	75023	75024	Sir Henry	296	" I do n't say I 've bought them . I 've actually bought one - and no doubt you can guess which one - but I have options which will give me control of the other seven at any moment I choose . "
75102	75106	75108	75108	Evelyn	290	" The Majestic ? "
75125	75136	75138	75138	Evelyn	290	" Not a vast amount of profit - earning there , "
75140	75199	75023	75024	Sir Henry	296	" On the hotel itself , no . But think of the real estate owned by the company , my friend . Its value has appreciated by a good sixty per cent . in the last fifteen years . And the figure they put it at in their Balance Sheet is grotesquely below the value to - day . "
75200	75251	75292	75293	For Savott	296	" Quite . I agree . But you spoke of it as a serious rival to the Palace . It is n't . They have n't even the sense to spend fifteen thousand pounds on replacing their worn - out carpets and curtains . To say nothing of the furniture . "
75252	75263	75264	75265	Sir Henry	296	" I have n't particularly noticed the carpets and curtains , "
75270	75280	75281	75281	Evelyn	290	" You will next time you go in there , "
75473	75483	75465	75465	He	1015	" You 're a bigger chap than I thought . "
75540	75546	75548	75548	he	1015	" You 've got eight , "
75557	75563	75548	75548	he	1015	" But you want nine . "
75566	75573	75574	75575	Sir Henry	296	" I want the Imperial Palace , "
75588	75763	75574	75575	Sir Henry	296	" If I ca n't bring the Imperial Palace into my merger , I 'll drop it . I could sell the Majestic at a profit already . I would sell it . And I 'd get rid of my options too . I 'd clear out of hotels and try something else . I have n't the least desire to mess about with an affair if it 's going to be only second - class . Second - c1ass is n't a bit my line . But I 'll admit I do n't want to clear out of hotels . The luxury hotel , as you 've made it , my dear Orcham , seems to me to be the most characteristic of all modem creations . It stands for the age , just as much as the Pyramids did for Egypt . Our age can be proud of it - I mean as an organism . It 's marvellous , and there never was anything like it before . The luxury hotel - "
75764	75772	75773	75773	Evelyn	290	" What about the department - store ? "
75776	75780	75782	75783	Sir Henry	296	" I agree , "
75786	76011	75782	75783	Sir Henry	296	" The department - store is just as characteristic , and original , as the luxury hotel . But as you probably know , I 've handled the department - store - both here and in Australia . My department - store merger is a proved success - and half the City prophesied failure for it . Well , that 's done . And now I 'm in for a hotel - merger . Only , it must be first - class . Splendid ! Gorgeous ! Something to sing about and write home about ! Otherwise I would n't give tuppence for it . Of course there 've been hotel - mergers already . I expect you know a lot more about my friend Hoster 's merger than I do . It 's pretty big . I 've no dependable information as to how it 's doing . But however well it 's doing it would n't be good enough for me . To my nose it smells of the suburban street and the provincial up from the country and the conducted tour and God knows what else ! No , no ! The Imperial Palace is the standard for me . And that 's why I 'm so keen on interesting you in my proposition . Orcham , I 'm damnably keen . "
76090	76112	76113	76113	he	290	" I ca n't quite understand this mania for mergers . It seems to me to mean the destroying of individuality , "
76140	76145	76147	76148	Sir Henry	296	" Destroying of individuality ! "
76150	76163	76164	76164	He	296	" Oh , hang it ! I 've let the thing out . "
76171	76176	76177	76177	Evelyn	290	" No , Savott ! "
76181	76204	76205	76205	He	296	" You can do most things in this room , but you are n't allowed to re - light a good cigar . "
76227	76236	76205	76205	He	296	" Oblige me by taking a fresh one . "
76257	76262	76263	76263	he	296	" Destroying of individuality ! "
76276	76400	76263	76263	he	296	" You of all people to say that ! Look at the present case . It would mean the extension of your individuality . It would give your individuality a scope - a scope - well , you see my idea ? I wo n't say anything about your greatest abilities . But take your efficiency . A merger means the spread of your efficiency ; it means the spread of the Imperial Palace standard . Is that nothing ? Destruction of individuality ! Why ! On the contrary ! A merger always means increased power and influence for the top - dog . And why is the top - dog the top - dog ? Why are you a top - dog ? "
76401	76412	76413	76413	Evelyn	290	" Yes . But what about the under - dog ? "
76440	76451	76453	76454	Sir Henry	296	" It 's no use talking about under - dogs , "
76461	76905	76453	76454	Sir Henry	296	" Nothing can stop mergers . They 've come , everywhere , in everything . They 're still coming , and they 'll keep on coming more and more . They 're bound to . All big enterprises will get bigger , and small enterprises will be swallowed up or go to hell . Bound to . I 'm not a scientist , and I could n't make a very clear story of evolution . But I 've got the hang of it . And what I say is , the merger is evolution . Anyhow , part of it . There it is ! It may be a bit rough on a lot of people . But what are you going to do about it ? Pull it up with a jerk ? You ca n't . You might as well try to tie a rope to the moon and pull that up . Evolution will go on . Where to ? We do n't know . At least I do n't . Nor care either . All I know is I feel in my bones I 've got to go on . Do you suppose I 'm taking on this job for money ? I 've made money . I 'm a rich man , very rich . And I want money - want it all the time . I 'm interested in money , but I 'm much more interested in my instincts . And I 'm sure my instincts are right . If they lead me to money , I ca n't help that . Money 's a side - issue . Pleasant enough , of course - but only a side - issue . I 'm pushing evolution forward . Somebody has to push it forward , and I 'm somebody . What will happen next , after mergers have had a fair show ? Who can tell ? Not me . It does n't concern me . Something - call it God or Nature or what you please - something 's put certain instincts into my bones , I tell you . I 'm not a religionist , but I have a conscience . Yes , I 'm conscientious . Sense of duty , somewhere down inside me ! And the duty is to use my instincts . Or let them use me . I should n't like to say which it is . There might be some bad consequences . Well , let there be ! My conscience will be clear . And I know jolly well there 'd be some good consequences . And soon ! "
76906	76923	76925	76925	Evelyn	290	" Does he think he 's a besom and going to sweep me into a corner ? "
76970	76977	76978	76978	he	290	" This fellow 's situation precarious ? "
76993	77034	76978	76978	he	290	" Rot ! His position could never be precarious . And if one situation went to smithereens he 'd build another and a better one in about half a minute . Still , that Resolution was a pretty wise precaution . "
77069	77188	77052	77052	He	290	" As we seem to be talking , I may as well tell you that my sentiments about the plight of the under - dog in this evolution of yours are rather strong . In a place like this you get some very melodramatic contrasts , and they make you think . And when I think for instance of you in your suite , or me here , and then of some of the fellows and girls down in the basements , I get a sort of a notion that there must be something wrong somewhere . And your mergers are n't likely to do such a devil of a lot to put it right . The reverse . "
77221	77238	77239	77239	he	296	" And has n't there always been something wrong ? And wo n't there always be ? "
77245	77352	77239	77239	he	296	" When there are no under - dogs the world will have to come to an end , because there wo n't be anything to improve . Perfection 's another name for death , is n't it ? And I must just ask you again : What are you going to do about it ? About these under - dogs ? Mergers mean mass - production and lower prices . What 's the matter with this country is that there is n't enough mass - production . Mass - production is the only chance for the under - dog , as far as I can see . "
77375	77692	77362	77362	He	296	" I 'm continually hearing about the soul - destroying monotony of organised labour in these days . One man doing one tiny fraction of a job all day every day . Well , that 's part of the penalty of cheap prices . But people forget that cheap prices are n't all penalty . They do have the advantage of raising the purchasing power of the under - dog ; therefore raising his standard of life . Do you want to go back to the old methods ? Even if you could , you 'd only raise prices and lower the standard of life . But you could n't go back . Because we simply do n't go back . And do you want to stand still ? Everyone knows you ca n't stand still . Then you must go forward . More mass - production ! And - more machinery ! I seem to see that machinery may at last put an end to the under - dog . It may wipe him off the earth by throwing him out of work . Well , somebody has to suffer . Anyhow when he 's dead he is n't an under - dog . See here ! On the voyage over , this last week , I thought I 'd have a look at the innards of the ship . I thought they must be rather like a hotel , and I wanted to pick up all I could in the hotel line . I did pick up some trifles . Of course you know , but I did n't know , that there are no bottle - washers in those big ships . All the washing - up 's done by machinery and the drying and everything , and better done than any bottle - washer ever did it or ever could do it . "
77693	77697	77699	77699	Evelyn	290	" Oh yes ! "
77701	77716	77699	77699	Evelyn	290	" All the big hotels have that machinery . Been in use for years . "
77717	77726	77727	77728	Sir Henry	296	" Wait a minute . Wait a minute . "
77738	77886	77727	77728	Sir Henry	296	" There are no miserable bottle - washers any more in the big shows . They 're gone . They may have died of starvation , and their families with them . But they 're gone . No more monotonous , dirty , greasy , soul - destroying labour for bottle - washers . Now that 's all to the good . That 's what I call an advance . And lots of other underdogs will follow the bottle - washers . Frightful martyrdoms no doubt for a generation or two . But it ca n't be helped . There is a chance that mass - production and machinery will abolish the under - dog . There 's no other chance . So in the sacred cause of social progress I am determined to bear with fortitude the present and future misfortunes of your under - dogs . "
77892	77898	77900	77900	Evelyn	290	" You may be right , "
77921	77952	77913	77913	he	296	" You probably are right . Anyhow it 's soothing to the mind to think you are ... But I 'm afraid I 've been leading you off the point . "
77953	77958	77959	77960	Sir Henry	296	" No , no ! "
77964	78233	77959	77960	Sir Henry	296	" I led myself . It was I who began about dogs . However , I 'll get back . I 've nearly finished . I told you I 'd be perfectly open with you , and I will . It 's a bit unusual for a buyer to be enthusiastic about what he wants to buy . Does n't help him in bargaining , does it ? I ca n't help that . I 'm after the Imperial Palace , and you know why . No one knows better . But the Imperial Palace would be no earthly use to me without Mr. Evelyn Orcham . Without him I would n't have it at any price . He is the Imperial Palace . He brought it from ruin to the most brilliant success in the shortest time on record . Of course there are hotels that have started from nothing and succeeded terrifically from the very day they opened . There are at least two in London . And even Mr. Evelyn Orcham could n't teach much to the fellows that run them . Only they 're cheap hotels . Even under - dogs - some under - dogs - stay in them for a day or two without being broke . They are n't luxury hotels , and it 's the luxury hotel and nothing else that interests me . I want something I can look at , with women walking around that I can look at , and money flowing out of pockets like water . There 's no fun in running a cheap hotel . "
78234	78241	78242	78242	Evelyn	290	" Oh yes , there is , "
78245	78366	77913	77913	he	296	" Well , naturally there is . I mean not my sort of fun , and your sort of fun . I could n't bear anything that I had a hand in to be spoken slightingly of . I could n't bear it ! ' Must be funny kind of places , ' I 've heard people - some of your visitors - say of those cheap hotels ; and if I 'd been in control of the funny kind of places I should have knocked the people down . Simply that . Because I could n't have borne it . You do n't know me if you think I should n't . You understand me - what I mean ? "
78367	78370	78372	78372	Evelyn	290	" Perfectly , "
78374	78392	78372	78372	Evelyn	290	" I daresay I should feel the same . But I 'm not a prize - fighter . "
78393	78399	78401	78402	Sir Henry	296	" Well , I am , "
78406	78412	78413	78413	He	296	" Off the point again ! "
78421	78808	78413	78413	He	296	" Now Mr. Evelyn Orcham is n't merely the king of the hotel world . He 's boss of the market in hotel - managers . And there are n't any under - bosses . There 's nobody but him - for a buyer like me , who wo n't have anything but the best . He owns the finest article in the market - himself - and he can put his own price on it , without arguing . He 's in the strongest position that any seller could be in . You see , I realise all that , and I would n't pretend I do n't . I want to buy Mr. Evelyn Orcham . Damn it ! Of course I want to buy him . He 's the foundation - stone and the keystone and everything of my blooming arch . And I 'm ready to pay for him . And when I 've got him safe , I want to make him the head - god of the greatest hotel - combine that ever was . Nine big luxury hotels ! And I want him to put his stamp on all of them , so that everybody can see the brand at a glance . I want everybody in the luxury world to know that every one of those nine belongs to the Orcham group - and nothing more need be said , no questions asked , no doubts raised , no qualms , no fears , apprehensions . ' It 's an Orcham hotel . It 's dear , but it 's worth the money . You know where you are in his shows . ' That 's how the luxury crew have got to talk among themselves . And that 's how they would talk , by God ! Why ! In London and Madrid and Paris and San Remo and Cannes and Rome we should put every other swell hotel out of business . Right out . We should divide the luxury crew into two sections - those who had the sense and the money to stay in an Orcham , and those who had n't ... Now , Orcham , is it worth your while to take the thing on ? Or am I a ranting idiot ? "
78814	78889	78809	78809	Evelyn	290	" If you want my candid opinion , I should say that you do n't coincide very closely with my idea of a ranting idiot . But it is n't worth my while to take the thing on . You see , I 'm very fond of the Imperial Palace . There 's a genuine attachment between us . I 'm happy here . I 'm content . I do n't want anything else . "
78911	78918	78919	78919	he	296	" Then you will excuse me , "
78928	79166	78919	78919	he	296	" But what I say is you 've no right to be happy and content here . How old are you ? You ca n't be fifty . Fancy any man under fifty being happy and content ! I 'm a long sight older than you ; but I 'm not happy and I 'm not content . And I do n't want to be , either . When I 'm happy and content I shall be so near to being dead that you would n't notice the difference . Why man , if you 're happy and content you might as well say you have n't got anything else to live for ! And what would you have to live for ? You 've made this place once , complete . You 've exercised your genius on it . You ca n't go on making it . It 's made . All you have to do is to keep it where it is . A touch here and a touch there . No more . And your genius going to waste ! Waste ! You 've realised one ambition , and a jolly good ambition . You 've created the finest luxury hotel in the world . Have n't you got any more ambitions ? Or are you at the end ? Under fifty ! Shall you be satisfied to sit down and fold your arms ? "
79198	79213	79195	79195	Evelyn	290	" There is n't much sitting down and folding of arms about this place . "
79258	79262	79263	79263	he	296	" Excuse me ! "
79274	79306	79263	79263	he	296	" I really do beg you to excuse me . When I get keen I 'm apt to - well , you know . So do I know - curse it ! "
79320	79325	79327	79327	Evelyn	290	" Not at all ! "
79347	79367	79327	79327	Evelyn	290	" Not at all . You 're very interesting . A talk is a talk . Do go on . "
79420	79429	79430	79431	Sir Henry	296	" Let me say just one thing more , "
79445	79569	79430	79431	Sir Henry	296	" Your talents are being wasted here - in my opinion , that is . Are you justified in wasting them ? Perhaps you are . I 'm merely asking the question . There 's still quite a great deal to do in the world . Perhaps luxury hotels are n't the be - all and end - all of life . But they 're a factor . And they happen to be your field . And what we want more and more to - day is efficiency . Efficiency is a speciality of yours . Why should n't nine luxury hotels set an example of absolutely tiptop efficiency ? Any efficiency , particularly when it 's spectacular , stimulates all other efficiencies . "
79587	79593	79577	79577	He	296	" You are n't going ? "
79594	79597	79599	79600	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , "
79602	79619	79599	79600	Sir Henry	296	" Thanks immensely for a perfect evening . I could n't have enjoyed an evening more . "
79620	79623	79577	79577	He	296	" But - "
79624	79717	79599	79600	Sir Henry	296	" Seems to me I ought to give you a chance to think it over . That 's all I ask . For you to think it over . No hurry . I should hate to hurry you . You 'll ring me up , or I 'll ring you up . I 'm not leaving the Palace yet . I do n't vanish out of hotels like Gracie . Au revoir . Your hospitality is the sort I can appreciate . Of course being in the Imperial Palace it would be . "
79730	79735	79736	79736	he	296	" And I say , "
79743	79757	79736	79736	he	296	" I rely on you to forgive all the noise I 've made . "
79780	79785	79786	79786	he	290	" A masterly exit , "
80418	80428	80461	80461	He	290	" Be still and know that I am God . "
81062	81071	81055	81055	He	290	" Ta - ta , ta - ta . "
81110	81119	81108	81108	Evelyn	290	" Ta - ta , ta - ta , "
81452	81459	81460	81461	father Dennis	3251	" You never dare leave it , "
81465	81488	81460	81461	father Dennis	3251	" The darned thing 's always liable to wake up before dawn and cry itself into convulsions if you are n't there . "
81702	81736	81687	81694	not the livelier of his acquaintances and colleagues	3268	" Yes , terrific fellow ! Made the place ! Perhaps he 's been there a bit too long . Thirty years . In a groove . You ca n't teach him anything now "
81833	81843	81822	81822	he	290	" Be still and know that I am God . "
82690	82695	82696	82696	Evelyn	290	" Morning , Oldham , "
82705	82710	82696	82696	Evelyn	290	" Morning , sir . "
82851	82861	82847	82847	Oldham	329	" If you think I 'm a bloody chambermaid - "
83119	83122	83124	83124	Evelyn	290	" Striped , "
83143	83158	83159	83159	He	329	" Black - and - white shirt , black tie , black French shoes . "
83172	83182	83184	83184	Oldham	329	" Yes , sir ... Excuse me , sir , "
83186	83222	83184	83184	Oldham	329	" Mrs. O'Riordan is unwell and thinks she ought to stay in bed . She would very much obliged if you could go and see her after breakfast . That was the message , sir . "
83228	83286	83223	83223	His	329	" Yes , that 's the message , and I give it you , but it 's the biggest piece of cheek I ever heard of in this hotel , and I beg to take no responsibility for it . You going to see the housekeeper because she 's ' unwell , ' as she calls it ! "
83287	83291	83293	83293	Evelyn	290	" All right , "
83297	83301	83293	83293	Evelyn	290	" Remind me . "
83302	83307	83223	83223	His	329	" Yes , sir . "
83345	83376	83342	83342	He	290	" It must be about the new floor - housekeeper . She wants to settle that business at once , and I may have some trouble with the old girl . "
83424	83429	83430	83430	Evelyn	290	" Here ! Steady ! "
83434	83446	83430	83430	Evelyn	290	" I told you the striped , not the broad stripe . "
83474	83479	83480	83480	Oldham	329	" Sorry , sir , "
83627	83670	83623	83623	He	1015	" What am I alive for ? What is my justification for being alive and working ? I can not keep on creating the Palace . I have created it . The thing is done . I ca n't do it again . "
83717	83720	83675	83675	he	1015	" Why ? "
84047	84059	84061	84061	Oldham	329	" Mrs. O'Riordan is in the sitting - room , sir , "
84071	84074	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" What ? "
84095	84106	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" She wants to see you at once , sir . "
84107	84115	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" Who let her into the room ? "
84116	84123	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" She came in , sir . "
84124	84132	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" But I thought she was ill . "
84133	84138	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" Yes , sir . "
84139	84145	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" What time is it ? "
84146	84154	84036	84036	Oldham	329	" Twenty minutes to eight , sir . "
84155	84163	84164	84164	Evelyn	290	" Now , look here , Oldham . "
84171	84210	84164	84164	Evelyn	290	" Get her out . Use your famous tact . Say I 'm late . Say I 'm not dressed . Tell her I 'll come along and see her in her own room as quickly as possible . "
84211	84216	84217	84217	Oldham	329	" Yes , sir , "
84337	84340	84341	84341	he	329	" Well ? "
84353	84360	84450	84450	he	329	" She 's gone , sir . "
84361	84366	84397	84397	Oldham	329	" Was she dressed ? "
84367	84382	84450	84450	he	329	" Well , sir , she was dressed , as you might call it . "
84383	84389	84397	84397	Oldham	329	" What do you mean ? "
84390	84396	84397	84397	Oldham	329	" A negleejay , sir . "
84444	84448	84450	84450	he	329	" The Times . "
84555	84561	84562	84562	he	329	" I say , Oldham , "
84569	84579	84562	84562	he	329	" what 's this about the Arsenal this season ? "
84884	84892	84894	84894	he	329	" Mr. Plimsing is outside , sir , "
84902	84910	84894	84894	he	329	" Wishes to see you , sir . "
84911	84915	84917	84917	Evelyn	290	" What next ? "
84938	84945	84930	84930	Oldham	329	" What did you tell him ? "
84946	84951	84894	84894	he	329	" Nothing , sir . "
84958	85023	84952	84952	Evelyn	290	" Well , tell him this . Tell him I ca n't see him here . Tell him I 'll see him in my office at nine o'clock . No . I 'll see him here at nine o'clock . And not before . I do n't care how urgent his business is . I wonder what 's come over the place this morning ! "
85046	85054	85056	85057	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" How sweet of you to come ! "
85317	85326	85314	85314	He	290	" I can deal with this all right . "
85516	85521	85523	85524	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Shoo ! Run ! "
85545	85558	85560	85560	Evelyn	290	" She 's wound up ; all nerves ; a bit hysterical , "
85588	85595	85597	85597	Evelyn	290	" You do n't look ill , "
85599	85610	85597	85597	Evelyn	290	" What 's this I hear about you being ill ? "
85611	85614	85616	85617	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Pleurisy , "
85618	85621	85622	85622	he	290	" Pleurisy ? "
85625	85638	85639	85639	She	339	" Oh ! If you do n't believe me , just look . "
85671	85677	85683	85683	she	339	" Come nearer and look . "
85698	85709	85683	85683	she	339	" You see how he 's plastered me all up . "
85710	85713	85683	85683	she	339	" Who ? "
85714	85720	85683	85683	she	339	" Dr. Constam of course . "
85730	85771	85772	85772	She	339	" So that when I move , the pleura wo n't rub . I sent for him before seven o'clock . I had such a sharp pain . It 's only a very slight attack , but it is pleurisy . "
85781	85839	85772	85772	She	339	" And that 's not all . He says there 's something funny about my liver . Well , I always knew there was . The gallbladder is n't working properly . But otherwise I feel very well . Only he 's told me I must keep as quiet as I can . As if I could ! "
85840	85859	85861	85861	Evelyn	290	" And your idea of keeping quiet is to come down to see me before I 'm dressed ! "
85869	85910	85683	85683	she	339	" You are n't very sympathetic . Pleurisy 's pleurisy , you know . It 's nothing yet ; but it might be very serious if it was n't taken in hand at once . I 've had it before . "
85911	85923	85772	85772	She	339	" Well , you ought to be in bed , then . "
85924	86032	85683	85683	she	339	" I am in bed , practically . I 'm only lying here while my bed 's being made . He says I must n't eat any fats - that 's because of the gall - bladder , or drink any alcohol - or as little as I can . I shall certainly drink some . I came down to see you because I just could n't wait . I know it was very naughty of me . I know you 're God . Mr. Cousin thinks he 's God too , but he is n't . Do sit down . I want to talk to you . "
86033	86049	85772	85772	She	339	" Very well . But ought n't you to leave everything till you 're better ? "
86050	86057	86059	86060	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" No , I ought n't , "
86074	86087	86062	86062	Evelyn	290	" And please do sit down . You fidget me . Please ! "
86226	86229	86230	86230	Evelyn	290	" Well ? "
86292	86299	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" It 's about Miss Brury , "
86316	86319	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Darling ! "
86325	86462	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" She came to see me last night . She wants to be taken back . She cried and I cried , and any woman with any heart would have cried . This notion that men have that women are hard on one another is ridiculous . It 's men that are hard on women , and do n't we know it ! Alice says she has n't got a penny - gives all she has to her married sister , who has about a thousand children - what a husband ! - and she simply dare n't ask for another place because everyone will know what happened here . And why should n't she come back ? Tired to death , and she has to deal with a drunken thief in the cloak - room - "
86463	86466	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Drunken ? "
86467	86470	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Yes . "
86471	86478	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" You never said that before . "
86479	86721	86301	86302	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Because I did n't think of it . And Miss Brury did n't either . Good - natured women do n't think these horrid things of one another . But it occurred to me all of a sudden . And so I sent down to Cappone to find out what that precious party had had to drink . Hock . A bottle and a half of champagne . Three ports , and three Armagnacs . She must have been drunk - or halfdrunk . But some of them hide it so cleverly . So I went to see Cousin immediately . This was last night . He was just leaving , and I kept him over three - quarters of an hour , and glad I am I did too ! What annoys me in Mr. Cousin is he 's always so calm . It 's unnatural - especially in a Frenchman . A Frenchman ought to know that a woman with something on her mind hardly likes talking to a stone wall . Well , Mr. Cousin does n't seem to know that . He just said Alice could n't be taken back , and she could n't and she could n't and she could n't . The pain I had got worse and worse . I told him I was very unwell , but do you suppose he cared ? No more than you do , Mr. Orcham ! "
86722	86728	86730	86730	Evelyn	290	" I 'm very sorry , "
86732	86770	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Yes . You look as if you are ! You would n't see me before because you were in your braces , and now you 're twiddling yourthumbs and you 're ' ve ry sorry . ' "
86812	86827	86828	86828	he	3394	" I 'm afraid we ca n't have Miss Brury back at the Palace , "
86831	86839	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Of course you men always agree . "
86840	86856	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" But I 'll find her another place , if you really want me to . "
86857	86860	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Where ? "
86861	86868	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Well , at the Laundry . "
86869	86874	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" At the Laundry ! "
86875	86879	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Why not ? "
86880	86902	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Oh , nothing ! Only it 's an insult . I have n't trained Alice to iron shirts and pants . "
86903	86917	86771	86772	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" She might be staff - manageress . It 's an excellent job . "
86918	86924	86926	86927	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Glad to hear it ! "
86955	87010	86951	86951	She	339	" Of course when a girl 's in a hole , through no fault of her own , and has n't a penny , you can safely humiliate her , and she 's obliged to thank you for humiliating her . Do n't I know ! I daresay you think I 'm being impudent . "
87011	87016	87017	87017	Evelyn	290	" Not at all , "
87021	87034	87017	87017	Evelyn	290	" I like you when you 're very ill - like this . "
87339	87347	87348	87348	She	297	" Oh ! So you like impudence ! "
87361	87371	87355	87355	her	297	" Yes , when it 's yours , mother . "
87372	87380	87381	87381	she	297	" Please do n't call me mother , "
87392	87396	87397	87397	he	290	" You darling ! "
87466	87469	87470	87470	he	290	" Sister , "
87479	87729	87464	87464	mother	9926	" I hate to be called mother , and if you 're so hard on poor Alice Brury I ca n't understand why you should make such a fuss about chambermaids having to open their bags and things to that brute Maxon . Yes , I got your note . I did n't answer it because I was so angry . Of course it 's not nice for girls to have to open their bags . Did you imagine we had n't thought of it ? As a matter of fact I long since started a system of them showing their bags to their housekeeper . But housekeepers ca n't always be on the spot to O.K. the bags with a bit of chalk . And even if they are , what 's to prevent the girls from getting a friend to hand them something on the stairs as they go down ? It all seems easy and simple to you ; but you 're a man and you do n't know . Any chambermaid could get the better of you . Chambermaids are awful . They 'd leave as soon as look at you . And you have to be after them the whole damn time . Just ask Miss Maclaren . She could tell you a few things . Chambermaids , oh yes ! But when it comes to Alice Brury , who 's been perfect , you 're absolutely flinty , you and your Mr. Cousin ! "
87733	87760	87730	87730	Evelyn	290	" But it must n't be forgotten that the unhappy Alice left us at a moment 's notice . I mean without any notice at all . "
87761	87764	87766	87767	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Yes , "
87769	87797	87766	87767	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" And that 's what I 'm going to do ! I 'm too young for this place . That 's what 's the matter with me ! "
87896	87903	87904	87904	he	290	" She 'll get over this , "
87907	87943	87904	87904	he	290	" It 's the beginning of the end of the nerve - storm . She 'll be through in about a minute now . Then she 'll be sorry . They 're always like that . "
88217	88227	88228	88229	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" You might rescue those letters from the cat , "
88235	88245	88246	88246	he	290	" You 're better now , are n't you ? "
88253	88261	88246	88246	he	290	" Perhaps you could sleep a little . "
88262	88265	88266	88266	she	339	" Better ! "
88276	88369	88266	88266	she	339	" I could n't be better . I was only crying because I 'm so happy . I 'm much too happy to sleep . Sleep ! I would n't sleep for anything ! I 'm going to be married . That was really why I came down to see you this morning - to tell you ! I wanted you to be the first to hear about it . But when you walked in here I did n't know just how to begin . You frighten me . You frighten everybody . "
88376	88388	88389	88390	the mother	9959	" Well , I do n't see anything to laugh at , "
88393	88408	88409	88409	Evelyn	290	" I was only laughing because I 'm so happy - in your happiness , "
88412	88423	88409	88409	Evelyn	290	" May one ask who is the favourite of fortune ? "
88433	88453	88454	88454	She	9959	" Colonel Sir Brian Milligan , Bart . - age sixty - eight , if you do n't mind . "
88462	88467	88468	88468	her	9959	" Look at me , "
88476	88532	88468	88468	her	9959	" I 'm the future Lady Milligan . And I am too young to be the mother of this hotel . I 'm young enough to catch a man and hold him even if I am only a hotel - housekeeper . Any man , except cold - blooded fishes like you and your Frenchman ! "
88876	88885	88886	88886	he	3441	" He 's rich , is n't he ? "
88896	88934	88889	88890	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" We are very fond of one another . Very fond . I adore him - but do n't tell him that when you meet him - and I shall try my hardest to make him happy . "
88940	88945	88946	88946	he	3441	" You 'll succeed , "
88949	88955	88946	88946	he	3441	" It 's a certainty . "
88956	88960	88961	88961	she	443	" Of course , "
88964	88983	88984	88984	She	443	" At my age I do n't want to be silly and talk about passion . And yet - "
88992	89122	88984	88984	She	443	" You know , his father lived to be ninety - eight , and got himself into frightful trouble with a housemaid three years before he died . And Brian 's exactly like a boy . D'you know , he writes poetry ! Nobody sees it but me and he makes me tear it up . At least he thinks he does . Naturally I keep it . I would n't destroy it for anything . I mean of course I do tear up the paper , but I learn it off first . He 'd be furious if he knew . He 's very passionate , by temperament . I 've told you his age . But what 's that ? Sixty - eight - and a boy ! "
89123	89131	89133	89133	Evelyn	290	" And you 're twenty - two , "
89135	89145	89133	89133	Evelyn	290	" The six is a misprint for a two . "
89146	89151	89152	89152	she	3445	" You are nice , "
89159	89164	89166	89166	Evelyn	290	" I feel nice , "
89197	89206	89171	89171	He	290	" When are you going to get married ? "
89207	89210	89215	89215	mother	9926	" Ah ! "
89226	89242	89215	89215	mother	9926	" That will depend on you . I wo n't leave you in the lurch . "
89250	89274	89243	89243	Evelyn	290	" You can leave now . You can get married to - morrow . You can begin your honeymoon to - morrow night . "
89316	89358	89313	89313	He	290	" Now listen to me , bride . This hotel will not be allowed to interfere with your happiness . You make your plans , and this hotel will fit in with them . I know you 're the impatient sort . "
89359	89364	89280	89280	He	290	" I 'm not . "
89365	89394	89313	89313	He	290	" Yes , you are . You do all you can to hide it , but if you imagine you 've hidden it from me you 're wrong . "
89395	89402	89280	89280	He	290	" But what shall you do ? "
89403	89411	89313	89313	He	290	" Oh ! Never mind . Something . "
89412	89418	89419	89419	she	3450	" But I do mind , "
89425	89431	89419	89419	she	3450	" I 'm very interested . "
89432	89449	89313	89313	He	290	" Of course you are ... Well , what about raising Miss Maclaren to the throne ? "
89450	89458	89419	89419	she	3450	" She 's rather Scotch and stolid . "
89459	89470	89313	89313	He	290	" She may be . But she 's a rock . "
89471	89483	89419	89419	she	3450	" Yes . But she 's rather young for the post . "
89487	89492	89494	89494	he	290	" I like that , "
89496	89538	89494	89494	he	290	" I like that from you , of all people . Here I 've been entrusting the entire place to a girl of twenty - two for years and years , and now I 'm told Miss Maclaren 's too young ! "
89548	89557	89558	89558	He	290	" However , we 'll talk it over . "
89595	89628	89585	89585	He	290	" I must go now . Remember what I said , please . The hotel shall fit into your plans . By the way , I suppose I can tell the staff ? "
89629	89647	89565	89565	her	339	" About me ? I wish you would . I 'm rather nervous about telling them myself . "
89648	89690	89691	89691	He	3452	" I 'll tell them . And I 'll come in and see you later in the day when I 'm somewhat calmer , and wish you every happiness . And you do as you 're ordered and go to bed . "
89700	89730	89691	89691	He	3452	" We shall give you a dinner . I mean the heads of departments . Not more than thirty . Quite informal . I shall ask Mr. Dover too . "
89731	89736	89738	89739	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" My dear sir , "
89741	89757	89738	89739	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" You must n't . I could n't bear it . I should feel so - "
89758	89766	89767	89767	Evelyn	290	" We shall give you a dinner , "
89770	89817	89767	89767	Evelyn	290	" And you 'll bear it magnificently . Of course you 'll cry . But they 'll all love to see you cry . I expect I 'm the only person who has seen you cry - and me only this once ... I must run . "
89824	89829	89830	89830	she	339	" Not a dinner , "
89834	89881	89818	89819	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Yes , a dinner . I suppose you expect a wedding - present . What would Sir Brian think if we let you go without giving you a wedding - present ? Well , there 'll be a dinner . No dinner , no present . "
89903	89907	89908	89908	he	3453	" I say , "
89911	89930	89908	89908	he	3453	" it seems you ca n't keep off your Irish Colonels . Getting quite a habit with you . "
89949	89964	89943	89943	She	339	" Not at all . Sir Brian was a friend of both my husbands . "
89965	89977	89978	89978	Evelyn	290	" And no doubt he has a house in County Meath , "
89986	89993	89994	89994	She	339	" And what if he has ? "
90006	90011	90013	90013	Evelyn	290	" I knew it , "
90042	90048	90050	90050	Plimsing	435	" Good morning , sir , "
90063	90068	90070	90070	Evelyn	290	" Morning , Plimsing , "
90077	90094	90070	90070	Evelyn	290	" One minute late . Sorry to keep you . Come in . What is it ? "
90125	90151	90153	90153	Plimsing	435	" If the trains on the Southern Railway were only a minute late , sir , life would be much simpler for some of us , "
90653	90658	90659	90659	Evelyn	290	" What is it ? "
90671	90679	90680	90680	Plimsing	435	" Rather a busy morning , sir , "
90696	90942	90680	90680	Plimsing	435	" I happened to be here early on another matter when I received information to the effect that the second - floor valet being called to roomwent in and left his pass - key in the door . This procedure was of course quite contrary to regulations , and I have told him so . When he came out the pass - key was gone . As I said to him , I take a very serious view of this culpable negligence ; for , as I need not point out to you , sir , even if the pass - key came back a duplicate of it could have been made in the meantime . I regarded it as so serious that I took the liberty of calling here to tell you at once , as Mr. Cousin was not yet on duty . However , it 's all right , sir . Since I saw Oldham I made enquiries , and on the strength of certain information received I telephoned to Scotland Yard , having two individuals in my mind 's eye , and they sent an officer in an express car to the Majestic , where both individuals were arrested , and on being searched one man was found to have the pass - key in his left - hand hip - pocket . Smart work , sir , if I may say so , having taken no part in the identification . "
90943	90949	90951	90951	Evelyn	290	" Very . Most satisfactory , "
90953	91117	90680	90680	Plimsing	435	" I may add that I should have gone to the Majestic myself , sir , to take observations ; but I was prevented by an Amsterdam diamond merchant , also fifth floor , who was just leaving and could not find a pair of trousers , which he alleged must have been stolen during the night . After some search and a little cross - examination I convinced him that he was wearing them . He was so apologetic that I ventured to ask him if he would let me drive with him to Victoria , as he was going to Paris by the 8.20 Newhaven - Dieppe . He did so , and gave me valuable information about diamonds , of which he had a large quantity on his person , in a receptacle stitched to the back of his necktie , sir . I was glad to know this . He invited me to feel them , which I did . "
91120	91125	91127	91127	Evelyn	290	" I congratulate you , "
91132	91153	91154	91154	He	3498	" I 'm rather pressed for time . Mrs. O'Riordan is leaving us , and I have to make arrangements . "
91178	91181	91183	91183	Plimsing	435	" Ah ! "
91187	91202	91183	91183	Plimsing	435	" Going to marry Sir Brian Milligan at last , I presume , sir . "
91203	91206	91208	91208	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
91292	91301	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" I will not detain you , sir , "
91314	91347	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" But you will be relieved to know that the matter of the so - called Mrs. de Rassiter is now settled . I shall submit a formal report in due course . "
91348	91353	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" Mrs. de Rassiter ? "
91354	91517	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" The mink - fur lady , sir . She has been identified as a female who was fined for being drunk and disorderly in Soho in the early hours of the day before yesterday morning . I called on Messrs. Murkett and Co. , formerly Murkett and Mostlethwaite , the solicitors who sent you that lawyer 's letter by messenger about the alleged missing fur . They had also sent in a claim to an insurance company , as I ascertained by enquiry , acting on a hint from my friends at the Yard . Must have got the drink at a night - club in Greek Street , but she probably had had a good deal before leaving here . So I surmised from what I heard of her behaviour before she left . A very shady firm , Murketts , sir . Mostlethwaite 's already inside , and Murkett will soon be there too if he is n't careful . "
91518	91523	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" ' Inside ' ? "
91524	91699	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" Yes , sir . In prison . No one can understand why Murkett has n't been struck off the rolls . I insisted on seeing Mr. Murkett . I said to him , I said : ' Perhaps you are n't aware that your client 's real name is Ebag . ' I said no more . Mrs. Ebag left by the 8.20Newhaven - Dieppe this morning , sir . That was why I was so anxious to be there . I wanted to be quite sure . Sorry I could n't have her arrested , but there had been no time to assemble my evidence . She will come back to London . They always do . They ca n't keep off , no more than rooks off a cornfield . I did n't want to tell you anything until I could tell you everything . I know how busy you are . But as I was here ... Good morning , sir . And I hope I 've not detained you . "
91700	91712	91302	91303	the detective	3499	" Not at all , Plimsing . You 've done excellently . "
91713	91719	91720	91720	Plimsing	435	" Thank you , sir . "
91727	91748	91720	91720	Plimsing	435	" Then you think the woman was a bit ' on ' when she made the row m the cloakroom . "
91749	91798	91720	91720	Plimsing	435	" I should say so , sir . If she had n't been she 'd never have begun the thing . I soon made up my mind that the coup had not been prepared . Good morning , sir . You wo n't hear another word from Murketts . "
91896	91960	91881	91881	he	290	" Having written and duly delivered my report for the day to Mr. Cousin , Maria , I proceeded , by motor - bus , to Victoria and caught the 6.5 . , in which I occupied a compartment with three gentlemen , one of whom I knew slightly and exchanged with him a few words about the financial situation in the City , "
92603	92608	92574	92574	He	3535	" Manager 's Office . "
92651	92658	92618	92618	her	3542	" Good morning , Mr. Orcham . "
92938	92959	92913	92913	he	456	" Mr. Cousin will be here in one minute , sir . He 's just having a word with Ruffo . "
92960	92963	92965	92965	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
92973	92984	92965	92965	Evelyn	290	" What about ? Ruffo 's here early this morning . "
92985	93012	92913	92913	he	456	" Yes , sir . There was no big banquet last night . It 's about some little difficulty over extra waiters for to - night . "
93013	93017	93019	93019	Evelyn	290	" I see , "
93062	93068	93070	93070	Pozzi	456	" I wonder , sir , "
93087	93097	93070	93070	Pozzi	456	" whether I might ask you a great favour . "
93098	93106	93107	93107	Evelyn	290	" You can ask , my boy , "
93115	93213	93070	93070	Pozzi	456	" It 's this , sir . You probably know that a few of us , Adolphe , Dr. Constam , Major Linklater , and myself , have a little lunch - mess of our own in 156 . Rocco has taken to golf , and we are giving him a club , or a set of clubs . There will be a lunch . Mr. Cousin has promised to come , and if youwould kindly come and preside , we should all be very delighted . And I need n't say how flattered Rocco would be . "
93214	93229	93289	93289	Evelyn	290	" But it would mean that I should have to subscribe towards the clubs . "
93230	93251	93070	93070	Pozzi	456	" Oh no , sir ! We should n't dream of such a thing . Mr. Cousin is not subscribing . "
93252	93255	93257	93257	Evelyn	290	" No , "
93259	93266	93267	93267	He	3564	" But I am . Here ! "
93278	93283	93070	93070	Pozzi	456	" Really , sir ? "
93284	93288	93289	93289	Evelyn	290	" Take it , "
93309	93317	93318	93318	he	458	" You are a sport , sir , "
93344	93351	93318	93318	he	458	" Thank you ever so much . "
93471	93492	93468	93468	He	290	" This boy is alive . I am not . He is a breath of air in all the stuffiness . "
93493	93502	93503	93503	he	290	" What 's the date of this orgy ? "
93506	93527	93468	93468	He	290	" The eighteenth , sir . Twelve forty - five . Rocco will make a special effort with the menu . "
93528	93538	93468	93468	He	290	" Write it down for me , will you ? "
93572	93578	93580	93580	Evelyn	290	" That 's agreed then , "
93582	93587	93589	93589	Pozzi	458	" Bravo ! Bravo ! "
93635	93650	93651	93651	Cousin	334	" Shall we have the pleasure of seeing you at the Conference this morning ? "
93661	93669	93655	93655	his	334	" Not unless there 's anything urgent . "
93670	93701	93655	93655	his	334	" Nothing urgent for the Conference , but I did want to get your instructions about Miss Brury . Mrs. O'Riordan had a long talk with me here last night . "
93702	93706	93708	93708	Evelyn	290	" Of course , "
93710	93722	93708	93708	Evelyn	290	" the whole situation is altered now that she 's leaving . "
93723	93728	93655	93655	his	334	" Leaving ? Who ? "
93729	93740	93708	93708	Evelyn	290	" Mrs. O'Riordan . Have n't you heard about her ? "
93741	93744	93746	93746	Cousin	334	" No , "
93758	93766	93746	93746	Cousin	334	" She was very amiable last night . "
93813	93818	93819	93819	Cousin	334	" Tiens ! Tiens ! "
93828	93899	93819	93819	Cousin	334	" Well , since six months I have had a little idea that something bizarre was going on in that dear lady . She has had a little air ... of another world ... I do n't know what . Indescribable . Certainly she has temperament ... At her age ! It is not natural . But what would you ? Englishwomen are always incomprehensible . A mixture so curious . "
93906	94041	93903	93903	his	334	" It is bizarre . But nothing could surprise me . For Sir Brian Milligan - there are men to whom it is necessary that they should complicate their lives . The excellent baronet is perhaps offering himself in this case a complication more serious than he imagines . But what do I know ? Between ourselves , my dear director , I avow frankly that I comprehend nothing , but nothing , of the affairs of the heart in this city of London otherwise so sympathetic to me . That is to say , I comprehend as an observer detached , with the brain , but I feel - nothing , but nothing . All that says nothing to me . Madame O'Riordan has indubitably had some luck , and I felicitate her . "
94068	94086	94087	94087	he	290	" As regards her successor , what do you think of Maclaren - as a provisional appointment ? "
94095	94314	94087	94087	he	290	" Ah ! The Maclaren ! Yes . That is quite another thing . She is not English . The Maclaren - one can come to an understanding with her . Yes , yes . It is an idea , that . Happily she is not a femme du monde . Madame O'Riordan has lately had a rage for femmes du monde . True , she is one of them herself . But I do not share her views in the matter . To me it is unnatural that a femme du monde should hold a servile situation . It is against nature . It demands that she should play a role . Artificial . She must think more about her role than about her work . Perhaps among the numerous Russian princesses that one sees now in Paris there are a few capable of persuading themselves to be born again into a state of servitude . But Russians are Russians . An Englishwoman can never be born again . It is the aristocratic race , above all . Madame O'Riordan brought to me a candidate for the position of the poor Brury . Very femme du monde . Oh , very ! Niece of a knight who blew his brains out . I did not encourage her . "
94315	94321	94323	94323	Evelyn	290	" I agree with you , "
94420	94425	94427	94427	Cousin	334	" I am glad , "
94432	94506	94427	94427	Cousin	334	" that you support me against this extraordinary proposal for taking Miss Brury back again . It must happen sometimes that someone must suffer . And Miss Brury has been unfortunate . But to take her back would be impossible unless we were to ignore the interests of the hotel . And your ingenious suggestion would solve the problem . Of course I accept it , without reserve . If you are satisfied - "
94507	94520	94570	94571	Miss Cass	336	" You had better have a look at Miss Powler for yourself . "
94521	94535	94427	94427	Cousin	334	" Of course . If you wish it . But I am sure - "
94536	94543	94570	94571	Miss Cass	336	" I will send for her . "
95083	95087	95089	95089	she	353	" One moment , "
95091	95099	95089	95089	she	353	" Which is Mrs. O'Riordan 's room ? "
95115	95122	95123	95123	she	353	" And what 's your name ? "
95126	95132	95134	95134	he	3605	" John Croom , miss . "
95139	95142	95134	95134	he	3605	" Jack . "
95621	95624	95583	95583	Violet	353	" go on "
96308	96319	96350	96351	Mrs. O'Riordan	339	" Mrs. O'Riordan , Cloak - room , Euston Station . "
96556	96560	96538	96538	she	353	" Good morning . "
96561	96567	96568	96569	The chambermaid	1285	" Good morning , miss . "
96613	96624	96538	96538	she	353	" Do you look after this room - these rooms ? "
96625	96630	96538	96538	she	353	" Yes , miss . "
96631	96656	96538	96538	she	353	" I 'm the new floor - housekeeper . My name 's Powler , Violet Powler . Will you tell me what yours is ? "
96657	96662	96538	96538	she	353	" Beatrice , miss . "
96663	96667	96538	96538	she	353	" Beatrice what ? "
96668	96673	96538	96538	she	353	" Mrs. Beatrice Noakes . "
96674	96679	96538	96538	she	353	" Been here long ? "
96680	96695	96538	96538	she	353	" Oh yes , miss . Ever since me poor husband died , 1917 . "
96696	96701	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" In the war ? "
96705	96719	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" I 'm sorry to hear that - I mean about your husband . "
96720	96725	96726	96726	Beatrice	466	" Yes , miss , "
96754	96761	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Any children , Mrs. Noakes ? "
96762	96797	96798	96798	she	888	" Oh no , miss . If I had I should n't be here , should I , seeing we sleep in . I 've worked on every floor of this hotel , miss , "
96804	96822	96798	96798	she	888	" Same as Miss Maclaren . Miss Maclaren used to take me with her whenever she moved . "
96823	96831	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Well that shows she trusted you . "
96832	96851	96798	96798	she	888	" Yes , miss . My word ! And now she 's going to be head - housekeeper - "
96852	96866	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Yes , yes . And you 'll still be on this floor . "
96867	96872	96798	96798	she	888	" Yes , miss . "
96873	96881	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" I think we shall get on . "
96882	96890	96798	96798	she	888	" You and Miss Maclaren , miss ? "
96891	96924	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Miss Maclaren of course . But I meant you and me . I 'm sure you 'll be able to tell me all sorts of things I 've got to know . "
96925	96964	96798	96798	she	888	" Well , miss , I always like to help - when I 'm asked . I never put myself forward , if you know what I mean . But when I 'm asked , I 'm there . "
96969	96978	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Do you know where Miss Maclaren is ? "
96979	96993	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" No , miss . She ai n't been up here this morning . "
96994	97001	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Is Mrs. O'Riordan coming back ? "
97002	97011	97013	97013	Beatrice	466	" That I could n't say , miss , "
97020	97028	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" You 've seen her this morning ? "
97029	97038	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Mrs. O'Riordan ? Oh yes , miss . "
97039	97045	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" She did n't say ? "
97046	97051	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" No , miss . "
97055	97064	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Has she asked you to her wedding ? "
97065	97154	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Well , miss , no . But I do believe she would have done - just to the church . Just to come in and see her go off like . But it 's a great secret , I hear . Nobody knows anything . They want a quiet wedding . I hope it wo n't be at a Registry Office . But it wo n't . Because Mrs. O'Riordan 's a Roman Catholic . Every Sunday morning she went to Mass , as they call it . "
97155	97164	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" I see her luggage is all packed . "
97165	97279	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Yes , miss . Some of it 's gone . And I did hear the rest is being sent for to - day some time . You could have knocked me down with a feather when she told me this morning when I brought her tea she had to leave at once . How she packed them trunks between last night and to - day I do n't know . I 'm quite free to tell you , miss . She only said to me I was n't to say a word till she 'd gone . Well , as she has gone - well , I did n't say a word . "
97280	97289	97290	97290	Beatrice	466	" Everyone seems to trust you , Beatrice . "
97294	97301	97290	97290	Beatrice	466	" I 'm very much obliged . "
97308	97316	96702	96702	Beatrice	466	" Anything I can do , miss - "
97317	97323	97290	97290	Beatrice	466	" Thank you , Beatrice . "
97377	97410	97365	97365	She	353	" I thought I ought to report that Mrs. O'Riordan had left before I got up here . Violet Powler speaking , in Mrs. Riordan 's room . She 's gone away . "
97411	97414	97418	97418	her	353	" Gone ? "
97421	97445	97418	97418	her	353	" But she ca n't have gone . She must have just gone out for something . She 'll be back again soon . "
97446	97453	97455	97455	Violet	353	" I do n't think so , "
97473	97499	97470	97470	She	353	" There 's nobody up here for me to refer to . Miss Maclaren is n't anywhere about . Will you please tell Mr. Cousin ? "
97500	97507	97418	97418	her	353	" It 's all frightfully queer , "
97514	97545	97418	97418	her	353	" I ca n't disturb Mr. Cousin just now . Listen . If you 'll wait where you are I 'll give you a ring in a minute or two . "
97555	97587	97670	97670	Violet	353	" Thanks very much . I say . Do you mind telling me your name ? I sha n't feel so strange when I 've got to know a few names . "
97596	97604	97670	97670	Violet	353	" Yes , of course . Tilton . "
97611	97618	97670	97670	Violet	353	" Christian name same as yours . "
97619	97626	97627	97627	Violet	353	" What ? Violet ? Really ! "
97647	97650	97627	97627	Violet	353	" No ! "
97655	97668	97627	97627	Violet	353	" I knew I should catch you , Miss Powler . Marian . "
97674	97678	97670	97670	Violet	353	" How nice ! "
97699	97742	97670	97670	Violet	353	" When you have a moment , come down here and see me . Any time . And I 'll show you the upper - staff file and go over some of the names with you . Au revoir , Miss Powler . "
98147	98156	98163	98163	Marian	468	" That Miss Powler ? Miss Cass speaking . "
98180	98194	98163	98163	Marian	468	" Mr. Orcham says please will you come down and see him immediately . "
98241	98254	98221	98222	her master	3698	" Thank you , Miss Cass . I 'll come at once . "
98589	98596	98579	98579	He	3714	" Ground - floor , please . "
98597	98602	98603	98604	the man	1015	" Yes , miss , "
98650	98663	98666	98666	Evelyn	290	" Good morning , Miss Powler . Welcome to the Imperial Palace . "
98740	98760	98761	98761	Violet	353	" Good morning , sir . Thank you , I 'm sure . You sent for me , sir . "
98791	98798	98799	98799	she	353	" Good morning , Miss Cass , "
98812	98819	98820	98821	Miss Cass	336	" Good morning , Miss Powler , "
98873	98880	98882	98882	Evelyn	290	" Come in , will you , "
98911	98915	98907	98907	he	290	" Sit down , "
99013	99029	99010	99010	she	353	" And I 'm not a lady , either , and could I ever be ? "
99036	99042	99043	99043	he	290	" Funny about Mrs. O'Riordan , "
99054	99151	99152	99152	He	290	" You do n't know the explanation , but I do . And I may as well tell you . We were going to give her a staff - dinner to - morrow night . She always said she could never go through with a dinner and hear her health proposed , and wedded happiness - you know she 's going to be married . I did n't believe her , and I insisted on the dinner . Well , I was wrong . She left a note for me this morning . Here it is . "
99162	99485	99152	99152	He	290	" She 's run away from the dinner . That 's all . I 'm sorry . But these brides - ! It does n't matter of course in the least , dinner or no dinner . Still , I 'm sorry . Miss Maclaren gets her job - Mrs. O'Riordan 's - and she 'll take over at once , anyhow this afternoon . I 've telephoned her and I 've told her something about you , and I think you 'll like her . And of course she 'll be on your floor . You 'll pick up your work in a couple of days . Miss Brury was doing ground - floor when she left us , but Mr. Cousin is starting you on Eighth - easier for you to learn there . But of course we do move our housekeepers up and down . You 'll know how to handle customers - I think I told you - and you know all about linen and how to deal with maids . It 's all much simpler than it sounds . Some sense is all that 's required . You trust yourself to Miss Maclaren , and if she is n't about , just act on your own . You 're bound to be all right . Only do n't worry Mr. Cousin . Ever heard of the chain of responsibility ? Well , we 're all links in the chain . Miss Maclaren is the next link above you , and Mr. Cousin 's above her , and I 'm above Mr. Cousin , and the Board 's above me . But remember , you ca n't skip links . Mr. Cousin can go to the Board only through me , and you can go to Mr. Cousin only through Miss Maclaren . It 's a necessary arrangement in a big place like this . Is that clear ? "
99486	99491	99552	99552	Violet	353	" Quite , sir . "
99492	99503	99152	99152	He	290	" How do you feel - on your first morning ? "
99504	99514	99552	99552	Violet	353	" Well , sir , I 'm rather nervous . "
99515	99551	99152	99152	He	290	" You do n't look it a bit , and so long as you do n't look it , it does n't matter . In fact it 's rather a good thing to be nervous . "
99801	99811	99812	99812	Evelyn	290	" Is there anything you want to ask me ? "
99818	99846	99815	99815	Violet	353	" No , sir ... No , sir . I only hope I - er - my dress and so on - I hope it will do . "
99908	99921	99922	99922	he	290	" I 'll tell you more about that when you stand up , "
100030	100038	100039	100039	Evelyn	290	" I hope you 'll succeed here , "
100043	100124	100039	100039	Evelyn	290	" Because I 'm responsible for your coming here . I think you will succeed . I 'm sure you will . Not my business to engage floor - housekeepers , you know . I never interfere . But when I was down at the Laundry that day , you remember , we were rather in a quandary , and it occurred to me you might be the very person we needed . Yes , and I think you are . "
100125	100134	100135	100135	she	3740	" I shall try to be , sir , "
100183	100275	100180	100180	Evelyn	290	" There 's a woman up on your floor who might be rather useful to you if you get on the right side of her . Bertha - Bertha something . Noakes , is it ? I 'll find out . Quite a friend of mine . Used to be on my floor . We shift her about whenever we 're in difficulties . She 's up there now because Mrs. O'Riordan was doing head - housekeeper and floor - housekeeper as well ; and not in the best health either . "
100276	100285	100160	100160	he	3741	" Do you mean Beatrice Noakes , sir ? "
100286	100309	100180	100180	Evelyn	290	" Beatrice . Beatrice . Of course . I simply ca n't remember names . So you 've come across her already ? "
100327	100338	100340	100340	Evelyn	290	" I can see that Heaven is watching over you , "
100342	100350	100340	100340	Evelyn	290	" You wo n't let me down . "
100351	100358	100160	100160	he	3741	" Let you down , sir ? "
100359	100390	100340	100340	Evelyn	290	" Nothing , nothing . Mrs. O'Riordan told me she would n't leave me in the lurch . Only she did . However , all things work together for good . "
100391	100408	100410	100413	a new Violet Powler	353	" It 's absolutely certain that I sha n't leave you in the lurch , sir , "
100415	100505	100340	100340	Evelyn	290	" No , you wo n't . I say , I should be glad if you 'd just see this afternoon to Miss Maclaren being fixed up nice and cosy in her rooms . She 'll never do it for herself , anyhow until there 's nothing else wants doing anywhere on the floor . And she 'll object to you bothering about it . Say it 's an instruction from me . That 'll settle it . Have some flowers put in the room , in both rooms . "
100506	100511	100513	100513	Violet	353	" Yes , sir , "
100525	100528	100530	100530	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
100542	100581	100582	100582	He	290	" I should think you 'd do very well . But ask Miss Maclaren . I shall be surprised if , before you 're much older , one of 'em does n't ask you what lipstick you use . "
100588	100594	100595	100595	Violet	353	" Thank you , sir . "
100601	100607	100608	100608	He	290	" Here . One moment . "
100612	100705	100608	100608	He	290	" I have to go down into the engine - room . You 'd better come with me . You ought to see the real part of the place . Besides , it makes conversation with customers . It 's an idea I had only yesterday . For the floor - housekeepers . What can they know of Floors who only the Floors know ? There 's a great deal more in this hotel than meets the eye . And it ought to meet the eye of important young women like you . "
101087	101090	101092	101092	he	3763	" Come , "
101130	101138	101139	101139	she	353	" I ca n't be quite ordinary , "
101189	101192	101194	101194	Evelyn	290	" Here ! "
101198	101207	101194	101194	Evelyn	290	" We may as well look in here . "
101222	101229	101194	101194	Evelyn	290	" Audit Department . Mr. Exshaw , "
101286	101291	101292	101292	Evelyn	290	" Mr. Exshaw in ? "
101297	101302	101304	101304	someone	2108	" Yes , sir , "
101461	101466	101467	101468	The man	1015	" Morning , Exshaw . "
101492	101501	101506	101507	the man	1015	" Ah ! Good morning , Mr. Orcham . "
101511	101528	101506	101507	the man	1015	" On careful inspection I realise that you are a gentleman named Orcham and my chief . "
101529	101534	101479	101479	Violet	353	" Got a moment ? "
101535	101544	101506	101507	the man	1015	" As many as you wish , sir . "
101555	101566	101568	101568	Evelyn	290	" This is Miss Powler , one of our housekeepers , "
101584	101621	101622	101622	Evelyn	290	" I 've come to the conclusion that it will be a good thing for the floor - housekeepers to get some kind of a notion of the more or less secret works of this place . "
101626	101659	101622	101622	Evelyn	290	" Miss Powler is the first to come . You may expect a few more visits . Do n't you think it 's rather a scheme ? Widen their horizons , eh ? "
101669	101674	101675	101676	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Well , sir , "
101683	101717	101718	101718	he	474	" we do think now and then that if the Floors knew about the way we straighten things out for them down here it might be good for their souls . Which floor ? "
101723	101726	101728	101728	Violet	353	" Eighth , "
101746	101765	101744	101744	himself	474	" So this specimen is a floor - housekeeper . Interesting to see . What next I wonder ! "
101797	101802	101804	101805	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Ah ! Eighth ! "
101811	101894	101804	101805	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Eighth is a wonderful floor for breakages . There must be somebody up there who plays hockey with tumblers . Breakages in the restaurant cost us a hundred pounds a week , but the percentage on Eighth I should say is higher . I do n't mean they cost the hotel a hundred a week , because we only pay a quarter , but the waste 's there . You got the special memo day before yesterday , Miss - er ? "
101895	101905	101906	101906	Evelyn	290	" This is Miss Powler 's first day here , "
101915	101918	101920	101921	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Ah ! "
101947	101953	101955	101956	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Bring me N here , "
101975	101990	101991	101991	He	474	" You might like to see , Miss - er . Restaurant . Grill . "
101996	102029	101991	101991	He	474	" Floors . First . Sixth . Eighth , yes . Here you are . Here 's the analysis of breakages on Eighth , week by week . Here 's last week . "
102093	102096	102098	102099	the ninny	3792	" Yes , "
102138	102159	102161	102162	Mr. Exshaw	474	" You 'd be very clever if you grasped all this in a month of Sundays , Miss - er , "
102201	102211	102212	102212	he	474	" I suppose she can see everything , sir ? "
102218	102221	102223	102223	Evelyn	290	" Certainly , "
102239	102239	102237	102237	you	474	"
102240	102255	102264	102265	the ninny	3792	" She might like to see how the floor order - slips are analysed . "
102256	102262	102264	102265	the ninny	3792	" Oh , I should ! "
102350	102363	102364	102364	he	474	" I think you ca n't carry any more , young lady , "
102374	102383	102384	102384	she	353	" Thank you very much , Mr. Exshaw , "
102389	102394	102396	102397	Mr. Exshaw	474	" Not at all , "
102437	102444	102446	102446	he	474	" Mrs. O'Riordan has left us , "
102457	102464	102466	102467	Mr. Exshaw	474	" So I hear , sir , "
102486	102497	102483	102483	Violet	353	" It is wonderful . I should call it exciting . "
102498	102506	102508	102508	Evelyn	290	" It is , is n't it ? "
102540	102546	102547	102547	she	353	" I 'd no idea - "
102551	102565	102547	102547	she	353	" No , you had n't , ' he said , quite ruthlessly . "
102605	102605	102609	102609	his	474	"
102632	102677	102624	102624	his	474	" We may as well look the fact in the face - you are an ignorant simpleton here . You 'll learn , but you do n't realise how much you have to learn , and I do n't expect you to realise it . "
103034	103044	103045	103045	Evelyn	290	" Might look in at the printing - shop , "
103100	103116	103088	103088	Evelyn	290	" Breakfast menu for the grill to - morrow morning . For the Floors too . "
103117	103121	103122	103122	Violet	353	" Oh yes , "
103149	103160	103162	103162	Evelyn	290	" Here 's a notice to the floor - waiters , "
103173	103196	103162	103162	Evelyn	290	" It will be stuck on the walls of the service rooms to - night . Is n't striking enough , perhaps . "
103269	103279	103280	103280	Violet	353	" Does the hotel do all its own printing ? "
103282	103285	103287	103287	Evelyn	290	" Rather ! "
103289	103323	103287	103287	Evelyn	290	" And it manufactures its own beds ; and its own silversmiths repair its own silver and electroplate and so on . Here ! You 'd better just glance at the Stocks Department . "
103490	103518	103519	103519	He	475	" Here 's the stationery . L3,250 's worth . Specially made paper . Our own water mark . Look ! Here 's a time - sheet . "
103528	103582	103519	103519	He	475	" See ? Time - sheets are the most indispensable things in the hotel . Every five minutes has to be accounted for here . Now fancy goods . We give away twenty thousand fans a year . That 's only one item . So on and so on . Now the glass . "
103889	103986	103883	103883	Evelyn	290	" You must go . You must go . I quite understand , Mr. Orcham . Quite . You have n't begun to see things , Miss Powler . But any time you can come down , I shall be at your disposal . I think that all housekeepers , and others , ought to visit the Stocks Department . Valuable knowledge . Yes . Valuable . Good - bye . So glad you came . Not at all . Not at all . Delighted . I love people to be interested as you 've been . "
103987	103991	103993	103993	Evelyn	290	" That man , "
103998	104031	103993	103993	Evelyn	290	" that man has seventeen children and seventeen grandchildren . At least seventeen was the last I heard . It may be eighteen by this time . He must be getting on . "
104116	104137	104100	104102	A broad man	3861	" Good morning , sir . I was beginning to think something had turned up to stop you from coming . "
104138	104141	104143	104143	Evelyn	290	" No ! "
104145	104160	104161	104161	He	3854	" I should have telephoned you in that case . This is Miss Powler . "
104169	104173	104174	104174	he	3854	" Mr. Ickeringway , "
104179	104191	104174	104174	he	3854	" Our chief engineer . We robbed the Navy of him . "
104243	104261	104262	104262	He	3854	" If you could see the new well now , sir . It 's just the moment . "
104267	104300	104262	104262	He	3854	" Yes , miss , I 'm a naval man . We 've a staff down here of sixty - eight , and all but three of 'em are naval men too . "
104335	104343	104345	104346	Mr. Ickeringway	477	" Five hundred feet deep , miss , "
104493	104505	104485	104486	Mr. Orcham	290	" That 's understood then . You can go right ahead . "
104506	104514	104515	104516	Mr. Ickeringway	477	" Better look at this , miss , "
104520	104594	104515	104516	Mr. Ickeringway	477	" It 's the new artesian well . Electric pump . It blows the water from the bottom straight up on to the roof . You would n't think we use 22,000 gallons of water an hour in the Palace . But that 's it . 22,000 . And soft water . This is about the only hotel in London that has soft water . Because we do n't depend on public supply . "
104595	104599	104601	104601	Evelyn	290	" Of course , "
104603	104612	104613	104613	he	290	" We could n't have had all this - "
104626	104660	104613	104613	he	290	" if we had n't built our new wings . All this is under the new last wing . Would n't have been room for it under the old part of the building . "
104662	104674	104676	104678	the chief engineer	1217	" Now you 'd better begin with the boilers , miss , "
104702	104770	104676	104678	the chief engineer	1217	" If anything happened to these , miss - well ! Nine fires . Oil - fed . Twenty - five tons of oil a day . Equal to fifty of coal . Yes . And here 's the turbine . 4,500 revs . , miss , and you can hardly hear it . It 's bedded in springs so it wo n't vibrate the hotel down . "
104810	104821	104822	104822	he	290	" It 's all right . It 's all right ! "
104850	104861	104863	104865	the chief engineer	1217	" They 're only testing the new semi - Diesel , "
104917	105016	104912	104914	the chief engineer	1217	" There is n't much of a load on now . There 'll be more at one o'clock , and a lot more in the evening . We get through a lot of current . Well , there are twenty - nine electric lifts . And a thousand horse - power of electric motors . And about six thousand light - units a day we get through . Come and see where we wash all the air for the public rooms and corridors , and ozonise it , and warm it in winter and cool it in summer . "
105052	105061	105062	105062	Evelyn	290	" You 'd better not stay in here , "
105073	105099	105066	105066	He	290	" So liable to catch cold in these sudden changes of temperature . I should n't like you to be laid up the first day . "
105116	105132	105134	105134	Evelyn	290	" And you do all your own repairs here , do n't you , Ickeringway ? "
105151	105183	105184	105184	Violet	353	" We do , miss . All . I think we may say that this is a se1f - containing unit , same as a ship , but a bit more . "
105273	105280	105282	105282	Evelyn	290	" A wonderful fellow , that , "
105292	105323	105282	105282	Evelyn	290	" I 've never seen him excited . Never . And his men would do anything for him . They simply worship him . I do n't quite know why . "
105324	105327	105329	105329	Violet	353	" Yes , "
105331	105375	105329	105329	Violet	353	" And you simply worship all your heads of departments . You 're so proud of them you ca n't keep it to yourself . And of course they would n't do anything for you ! Oh no ! Naturally they would n't ! "
105478	105484	105485	105485	she	353	" It makes you think , "
105488	105515	105516	105516	he	290	" What ? All that ? You have n't seen half . Not half ... yes . You could understand anyone wanting to buy this place , "
105519	105523	105524	105524	she	353	" Oh yes ! "
105528	105537	105524	105524	she	353	" I suppose you get lots of offers . "
105538	105553	105554	105554	He	290	" I do n't get lots , but I get one now and then . "
105566	105581	105524	105524	she	353	" I remember somebody thinking of trying to buy it a long time ago . "
105582	105585	105586	105586	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
105595	105600	105586	105586	Evelyn	290	" Who was that ? "
105601	105657	105524	105524	she	353	" Sir Henry Savott . He told my sister once , and she told me . She said to me : ' He has n't finished with his department - stores business , but he 's thinking about something else - hotels . Imperial Palace and so on . ' I remember the very words . "
105720	105723	105725	105725	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
105729	105732	105735	105735	he	3893	" Indeed ! "
105751	105761	105762	105762	Violet	353	" But I expect he gave up the idea , "
105765	105771	105772	105772	Evelyn	290	" And when was this ? "
105775	105788	105789	105789	Evelyn	290	" I could n't say , sir , now . Years since . "
105801	105803	105789	105789	Evelyn	290	" Private "
105844	105894	105895	105895	She	353	" Thank you very much , sir . About those flowers for Miss Maclaren 's rooms , sir , that you said I was to see to . Can you tell me how I get them ? Where ? I ought n't to ask Miss Maclaren , ought I ? "
105899	105902	105903	105903	Evelyn	290	" No , "
105912	105975	105903	105903	Evelyn	290	" You 'd better not ask me things like that . You go upstairs and find out . You 'll have far more important things than that to find out . I count on you to fall on your feet . The Floors are in a bit of a mess , I mean as regards supervising . So I count on you . "
105976	105981	105983	105983	Violet	353	" Sorry , sir , "
106060	106071	106054	106054	He	3900	" Good - morning , sir . Thank you again . "
106079	106155	106076	106076	she	353	" I 'd better keep as quiet as possible about all this sightseeing this morning . I do n't want to start with a lot of jealousies . I 'd better pretend it was nothing , but he just told me to come and I went , and they 'll all have to go . It 's a pity I was the first to go . That 'll make them jealous - without anything else . "
106311	106317	106318	106318	she	3908	" You 're Miss Powler ? "
106329	106332	106322	106322	Violet	353	" Yes . "
106333	106357	106285	106290	The fairly young woman in black	3908	" My name 's Maclaren , and I suppose I 'm head - housekeeper now . I 've been asking for you everywhere . "
106378	106381	106383	106383	Violet	353	" Sorry , "
106385	106392	106383	106383	Violet	353	" Mr. Orcham sent for me . "
106393	106418	106419	106420	Miss Maclaren	319	" Just come in here a moment , will you ? I 've only got five minutes . I must go back to Fourth . "
106438	106445	106419	106420	Miss Maclaren	319	" What did Mr. Orcham want ? "
106476	106499	106473	106473	She	353	" He said as I was down there he 'd show me some things in the basement , so I should know . "
106500	106503	106505	106506	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! "
106561	106565	106554	106554	She	353	" thought Violet . "
106592	106610	106572	106572	she	353	" I should be so glad if you 'd just tell me what I have to do . "
106611	106707	106739	106740	Miss Maclaren	319	" You have to inspect all the rooms that are unoccupied or empty for the time being . First of all you turn on all the lights , whether it 's daylight or not , to see they 're in order . Try the curtains . See all the taps are right and do n't drip . And the locks right everywhere , and everything clean . Bed - linen has to be changed every two days . But some visitors want it changed every day . And you have to watch the chambermaids and - "
106708	106719	106572	106572	she	353	" I 've talked to one , as I said . "
106720	106738	106739	106740	Miss Maclaren	319	" Beatrice , I expect . She 's good . But she thinks she 's Mr. Cousin . "
106745	106759	106739	106740	Miss Maclaren	319	" She 'll want to run you , instead of you running her . "
106760	106769	106770	106770	Violet	353	" I think I can see to that , "
106777	106952	106739	106740	Miss Maclaren	319	" Never give them an inch - I mean the maids . Not an inch . And do n't give them half a minute in the mornings . They have to sign on at half - past six . And every second morning you have to be on duty at half - past six to see them sign on , on both Eighth and Seventh . Miss Prentiss - she 's Seventh - does it on the other morning . In turns , you see . I may as well tell you the hours now . You have half a day a week off , and every second week - end - from Saturday at three , about , till Monday morning . You have four hours off every day - if you 're lucky . When you have early morning duty , 6.30 , you finish at nine at night . On the other days you begin at nine in the morning and finish at midnight . Of course they 're long hours . "
106953	106961	106962	106962	Violet	353	" Oh ! That 's all right , "
107136	107140	107141	107142	Miss Maclaren	319	" And then , "
107145	107171	107141	107142	Miss Maclaren	319	" you have to be ready to go into any room instantly , if any visitor asks for the housekeeper , to settle any trouble . "
107172	107175	107177	107177	Violet	353	" Yes , "
107179	107210	107211	107211	She	353	" I remember Mr. Orcham telling me about that when he first sent for me . I daresay I can manage it . I 've had to do it before . "
107226	107233	107234	107234	she	353	" Do I have any keys ? "
107237	107280	107281	107282	Miss Maclaren	319	" You have a pass - key to the rooms and duplicate keys of the linen - closets . That 's all . Now you 'd better begin now with - let me see - my head 's all in a whirl . "
107290	107311	107281	107282	Miss Maclaren	319	" Mrs. O'Riordan leaving like this . I 'd no idea of it , Miss Powler . Not a notion . "
107312	107335	107281	107282	Miss Maclaren	319	" It must be frightfully trying . Mr. Orcham told me that I must first of all see to your rooms here . "
107336	107344	107346	107347	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! That does n't matter , "
107349	107360	107346	107347	Miss Maclaren	319	" There 's lots of things more important than that . "
107361	107373	107374	107374	Violet	353	" But if he finds out I have n't done it , "
107377	107411	107374	107374	Violet	353	" I might be in trouble - right at the start . He seemed very anxious for it to be done . But of course I know I take my orders from you . "
107412	107418	107419	107420	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! Very well ! "
107424	107443	107444	107444	She	319	" But I do wish Mr. Orcham would n't try to run everything himself . He always does . "
107454	107671	107444	107444	She	319	" Let him have his own way . I 'm on Fourth now . I 'll give instructions for all my things to be sent up immediately . And you do what you like with them . I 've no time . There 's been an oak and wicker bedstead simply broken to bits on Fifth . Some actress . She must have done it herself in one of her tantrums . But of course nobody 's done it ! Mr. Cousin 's secretary just tells me in her casual way Mrs. O'Riordan 's gone , and Mr. Orcham telephones me himself and says I 'm to take charge as quick as I can , and the first thing I have is this bedstead affair . It 's worth L40at least . If I was Mr. Cousin I should ask her royal highness to leave to - day , but he wo n't , I know he wo n't , because she 's supposed to be a great actress and good publicity . You 'd hardly believe it , but she 's making a fuss because a new bedstead has n't been brought in at once ! That 'll just show you the kind of thing a housekeeper has to face . Has your luggage come ? "
107672	107679	107765	107766	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes . It 's here . "
107680	107685	107444	107444	She	319	" Have you unpacked ? "
107686	107690	107765	107766	Miss Maclaren	319	" Not yet . "
107691	107708	107444	107444	She	319	" Well , while you 're waiting for my things you go and get straight yourself . "
107739	107751	107736	107736	She	353	" I 'll let her see she can depend on me . "
107864	107876	107882	107882	Beatrice	466	" Oh ! Can I help you to unpack , miss ? "
107948	107965	108466	108466	She	353	" No thank you , Beatrice . But I 'll tell you what you can do . "
107966	107971	108466	108466	She	353	" Yes , miss . "
107972	107992	108466	108466	She	353	" And at once . Go and do out Miss Maclaren 's rooms , as quick as you can . "
107993	108002	108466	108466	She	353	" Miss Maclaren is on Fourth , miss . "
108003	108024	108466	108466	She	353	" She 's coming up here . I meant Mrs. O'Riordan 's rooms . What 's the number of them ? "
108025	108038	108466	108466	She	353	" Oh , I see , miss . They 've no number . "
108039	108062	108466	108466	She	353	" Well , go and do them out now . And put Mrs. O'Riordan 's trunks and things out into the corridor . "
108063	108084	108466	108466	She	353	" I misdoubt if I can move the big one by myself , miss . And chambermaids are n't supposed - "
108085	108100	108466	108466	She	353	" Well , then , get someone to help you . Get a waiter . "
108101	108158	108466	108466	She	353	" Oh , miss , not a waiter . I dare n't . Us and the valets are about equal as you may say . But a waiter . If I got giving order - messages to the waiters I should have old Mr. Perosi down on me like half - a - ton of coal . "
108159	108165	108466	108466	She	353	" Who 's Mr. Perosi ? "
108166	108218	108466	108466	She	353	" He 's the head - waiter for all the Floors , miss . And he 's terrible particular . Mrs. O'Riordan and him once had some words , an ' it was just like the hotel being on fire . Mr. Orcham had to settle that , he had . Of course
108219	108228	108466	108466	She	353	" Then get a valet to help you . "
108229	108234	108466	108466	She	353	" Well , miss - "
108235	108245	108466	108466	She	353	" How many valets are there on this floor ? "
108246	108277	108466	108466	She	353	" Two , miss . What I was going to say , miss , one 's pressing a suit urgent at this very moment , and the other 's off . "
108278	108293	108466	108466	She	353	" And the other maids ? How many are there of you up here ? "
108294	108427	108466	108466	She	353	" Four , miss . And forty rooms . Besides all the bits of sewing we have to do for visitors . Of course there 's more rooms on the other floors . But here you see there 's more store - rooms and the carpenter 's shop , besides the head - housekeeper 's rooms , and the lampshade room . There 's more maids on the lower floor , but forty bedrooms among three of us! .. And things are a bit messed up to - day . Miss Prentiss did n't see us sign on this morning , and you know what young girls is , miss . I 've been telling 'em . They were fearful late this morning . But of course , miss , if you - "
108428	108437	108439	108439	Violet	353	" Come along , Beatrice . Come along , "
108490	108496	108478	108479	This Beatrice	466	" And aloud , gaily : "
108513	108528	108508	108508	I	0	" Three of the lighter articles of baggage were thus deposited in the corridor . "
108546	108546	108540	108540	I	0	"
108547	108552	108508	108508	I	0	" Yes , miss . "
108572	108598	108561	108561	Violet	353	" Now you get your brushes and things and do these rooms out , and come and tell me as soon as they 're finished . "
108599	108604	108540	108540	I	0	" Yes , miss . "
108605	108622	108561	108561	Violet	353	" You 'll easily do them before your dinner . When is your dinner - time ? "
108623	108635	108540	108540	I	0	" Twelve o'clock , miss . And if we 're late - "
108636	108644	108561	108561	Violet	353	" But you wo n't be late . "
108645	108789	108540	108540	I	0	" No , miss . I was only saying if we are late we 're likely to lose on it . There 's two relays . I 'm in the first this week . When I first came here the food - well , you could n't eat it . But it 's better now . Though they do say it only costs the management one - and - six a day a head of us . You see our dining - room 's down in the upper basement . Same as yours , miss . The floor - housekeepers have a table in the room next to ours . The page - boys eat in there too . It 's just been redecorated . It ai n't very easy to find , miss . But they 'll tell you at the lift . "
108790	108796	108797	108797	Violet	353	" I daresay they will , "
109098	109107	109111	109111	herself	353	" I 've got to be damn careful , "
109751	109758	109710	109710	she	9569	" These Miss Maclaren 's things ? "
109759	109764	109710	109710	she	9569	" Yes , miss . "
109765	109774	109710	109710	she	9569	" All right . You know the rooms ? "
109775	109780	109710	109710	she	9569	" Yes , miss . "
109781	109787	109788	109788	She	9569	" You 're from Fourth ? "
109795	109800	109710	109710	she	9569	" Yes , miss . "
109860	109869	109858	109858	Violet	353	" You 've been pretty quick , Beatrice . "
109870	109890	109858	109858	Violet	353	" Thank you , miss . I think you 'll find everything 's clean . Of course when we - "
109891	109897	109858	109858	Violet	353	" What are these keys ? "
109916	109941	109858	109858	Violet	353	" Miss Maclaren 's sent them up , miss . They 're your pass - key and the keys of the linen - closets . "
109942	109945	109946	109946	Violet	353	" Good . "
109960	109982	109983	109983	Beatrice	466	" I suppose I 'd better undo some of these things , miss . It does n't matter about my dinner . "
110029	110068	110017	110017	Violet	353	" It does matter about your dinner , Beatrice . I sha n't be late for mine and I wo n't have you being late for yours . Off you go ! You 'll just be in time . "
110069	110080	110081	110081	Beatrice	466	" Oh ! If it 's like that , miss ! "
110085	110094	110081	110081	Beatrice	466	" I was only going to tell you - "
110095	110105	110017	110017	Violet	353	" Tell me afterwards , when you come up . "
110106	110116	110081	110081	Beatrice	466	" But you wo n't be up , miss . "
110117	110127	110017	110017	Violet	353	" Well , when I do come up then . "
110474	110481	110464	110465	Miss Maclaren	319	" My God ! The flowers ! "
110501	110508	110487	110487	She	353	" It slipped my memory , miss "
110741	110750	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" You are asked for here , miss , "
110769	110780	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" Me ? I 'm the new floor - housekeeper . "
110781	110784	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" Yes . "
110785	110790	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" Who is it ? "
110791	110806	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" I do not know quite . I have been three days away ill . "
110807	110813	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" Is it a lady ? "
110814	110820	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" No . A gentleman . "
110821	110829	110752	110753	the waiter	1350	" Very well . I 'm coming . "
110999	111005	111006	111006	she	353	" How silly of me ! "
111010	111022	111006	111006	she	353	" Of course ! The bathroom is one of the rooms ! "
111284	111288	111277	111277	she	353	" Come in ! "
111519	111548	111516	111516	he	296	" Now what - what in the name of coincidence is the meaning of this ? How are you ? I 'm delighted to see a familiar face . "
111560	111568	111569	111569	she	353	" This is my first day here , "
111585	111617	111569	111569	she	353	" And this is the first room I 've seen , and you 're the first visitor who has sent for me , and I hardly know where I am yet . "
111630	111641	111627	111627	she	353	" What can I do for you , Sir Henry ? "
111688	111693	111694	111694	he	296	" Do sit down , "
111697	111709	111710	111710	Violet	353	" I 'm all right , thank you , Sir Henry , "
112059	112065	112067	112068	Sir Henry	296	" Well , Miss Powler , "
112070	112123	112067	112068	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm genuinely glad to see you here . I seem to remember Mr. Orcham mentioning to me that there was some idea of your coming here . I 'm glad because I 'm quite sure you were thrown away at that Laundry . This is just the place for you . "
112153	112162	112163	112163	Violet	353	" You 're very kind , Sir Henry , "
112166	112176	112163	112163	Violet	353	" But I 've a great deal to learn . "
112177	112241	112270	112270	his	4074	" Not you . You were first - rate at my house . You know all about maids and valets and so on . And you know exactly how to treat guests . You 've got nothing to learn , really , except - what shall I say ? - the geography of the hotel . And a few tuppenny - halfpenny rules . "
112242	112261	112263	112263	Violet	353	" It 's understood it takes six months or more to train a housekeeper here , Sir Henry , "
112292	112300	112302	112302	he	4074	" Not for a woman like you , "
112309	112344	112346	112346	he	4074	" A fool could n't be trained in six months or six years . But you have intelligence , and you know it . You 're bound to have a successful career . Of course "
112351	112455	112346	112346	he	4074	" accidents do happen . I do n't think for a moment they will , but you ca n't be sure . I 'm convinced you 'll rise high in this place . But if anything should happen , I want you to know that in some other hotels , anyhow one - and there may be more - what I say goes . And if ever you want a change , you just send me one line , one line , and I 'll fix it . Oh yes ! I 'll do it for my own sake , and glad to ! "
112456	112482	112533	112533	he	296	" It 's very kind of you , Sir Henry . Very kind . But I hope I sha n't - I do n't think - "
112483	112514	112346	112346	he	4074	" Neither do I. I 'm only saying ' if . ' And there 's something else - you do n't mind me giving you a tip , do you ? "
112545	112555	112556	112557	Sir Henry	296	" I suppose you do n't know any French ? "
112560	112598	112556	112557	Sir Henry	296	" No . I know you do n't , because I remember once when I had Monsieur Messein down at Claygate and there was some mix - up in his bedroom , Miss Gracie had to interpret . "
112599	112631	112556	112557	Sir Henry	296	" No , Sir Henry . I did begin to learn French at the South - West London Polytechnic , but I forgot it all as soon as I left there . "
112632	112810	112556	112557	Sir Henry	296	" Well , take my tip and learn French . In this new business of yours here it 'll be of the greatest use to you . Would n't be much good in an ordinary English hotel , of course . But this is a cosmopolitan show where you get all sorts of clients . It would give you a sort of a standing , you see . In France and so on housekeepers and cashiers and reception - clerks - they 're often women - can speak English , have to ; but in England , even in London , how often do you see a housekeeper who can talk anything but English ? Scarcely ever . I undertake to say there is n't one housekeeper in the I.P. can speak French . Of course you always hear that English is the international language . It may be . It is . But not in the luxury world , and the luxury world 's your world , you know . Think it over , will you ? "
112811	112820	112821	112821	Violet	353	" Oh , I will , Sir Henry , "
112864	112872	112835	112835	She	353	" Give her a sort of standing ! "
112895	112924	112882	112883	Miss Maclaren	319	" Better send for Miss Powler . Where 's Miss Powler ? Miss Powler can talk French . Miss Powler will see the lady - or the gentleman . "
113056	113073	113048	113048	she	353	" It might be rather hard for me to do it here , Sir Henry,'she said . "
113088	113088	113082	113082	I	0	"
113089	113162	113048	113048	she	353	" Hard ? Here ? Could n't get out ? What do you want to get out for ? Why , there must be scores of people in this place who talk French better than they talk English ! And some of them would be glad to teach you . You could easily come to an arrangement . Simplest thing in the world . A little enterprise needed ; that 's all . "
113163	113167	113169	113169	Violet	353	" I shall , "
113178	113188	113169	113169	Violet	353	" I 'm very much obliged , Sir Henry . "
113568	113578	113580	113581	Sir Henry	296	" I 'd like something done about this desk , "
113612	113618	113619	113619	Violet	353	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
113632	113640	113702	113702	his	296	" It 's too small for me . "
113641	113647	113702	113702	his	296	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
113648	113655	113702	113702	his	296	" I want a larger one . "
113656	113662	113702	113702	his	296	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
113663	113675	113702	113702	his	296	" And I want it changed as quick as you can . "
113676	113682	113702	113702	his	296	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
113716	113773	113774	113774	He	296	" I was down on the third floor . I had a larger desk there . I 've been out of London for a bit since I met you in the hall that day . I got back yesterday , and I moved up here yesterday evening ... Pretty view from here , is n't there ? "
113802	113928	113774	113774	He	296	" It was really because of the view I decided to come up to this floor . You see , on the third floor you 're just level with the tops of the trees , and you ca n't see a thing . I like a view . Space . I ca n't do with being shut in . See the new Devonshire House there ? Then there 's another thing . Say what you like about sound - proof rooms , it 's always quietest on the top floor . Now about this desk . You see , my secretary , or one of 'em , has to be able to work at it sometimes . There were two desks in my room downstairs . "
113929	113941	114055	114055	His	296	" I expect it was a larger room , Sir Henry . "
113942	113975	113774	113774	He	296	" It certainly was . These rooms are too narrow for their length . Still , I prefer this room of the two . Only I want a larger desk . Understand ? "
113976	114025	114026	114026	She	4102	" Yes , Sir Henry . I 'll get it as quickly as I can . But the head - housekeeper 's had some trouble downstairs , and as I told you , I do n't know a thing here yet . This is a question of geography . "
114030	114035	114036	114037	Sir Henry	296	" Quite , quite , "
114041	114054	114055	114055	His	296	" But I want a larger desk and the sooner the better . "
114083	114117	114079	114079	he	296	" I do n't care about your head - housekeeper and her troubles , and it 's no affair of mine that you do n't know a thing . I want my desk . "
114118	114125	114063	114063	he	296	" I 'll go right now . "
114126	114133	114079	114079	he	296	" That 's a good girl . "
114148	114157	114142	114142	She	353	" Just a minute . You remember Jim ? "
114158	114171	114142	114142	She	353	" Jim , Sir Henry ? I 'm afraid I do n't . "
114172	114185	114142	114142	She	353	" Yes , you do . He was second footman at Claygate . "
114186	114190	114142	114142	She	353	" Oh yes ! "
114213	114293	114142	114142	She	353	" Well , I made him my valet . He 's here with me now . He was taken ill in the night on the journey , and I 've sent him to bed . I wish you 'd go and see for yourself what 's the matter with him . And then report to me . If he 's going to be really ill I must get a temporary . I only want to know how I stand . "
114294	114300	114301	114301	She	4104	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
114336	114344	114346	114348	the great man	1626	" I 'll stay here and wait , "
114352	114358	114346	114348	the great man	1626	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
114406	114414	114401	114401	He	296	" Oh ! Do n't ask me . "
114495	114500	114501	114502	Miss Maclaren	319	" What 's this ? "
114546	114550	114552	114553	the waiter	1350	" Two teas , "
114572	114583	114585	114586	Miss Maclaren	319	" I did n't say two ' dry ' teas , "
114602	114660	114585	114586	Miss Maclaren	319	" Please take this away , and let me have it all on a larger tray , the one Mrs. O'Riordan always had , and her tea - pot , and plenty of bread - and - butter , and cakes , and some black - currant jam . And I 'm in a hurry , please . "
114670	114677	114678	114679	Miss Maclaren	319	" That 's just like them , "
114696	114877	114684	114684	Violet	484	" However , I believe in beginning as you mean to go on . He knew perfectly well . The floor - housekeepers have their tea downstairs where they have their other meals . Only if they want tea upstairs they can have it in their bedrooms . But it 's what we call a ' dry ' tea . Nothing to eat with it , you know . But the head - housekeeper is at liberty to have whatever she wants , and she 's served by a floor - waiter , same as a visitor . Mrs. O'Riordan always had that , and I shall . He was only trying it on . He has n't been here very long , and he 's ill half the time , or pretends to be . Still , he ought surely to have seen enough of me to know I 'm not the sort of person to try things on with . He soon will know - I 'll attend to that ! Do n't you think I 'm right ? "
114878	114881	114882	114882	Violet	484	" Rather ! "
115057	115060	115050	115050	she	484	" Rather ! "
115061	115077	115079	115080	Miss Maclaren	319	" You must have had some lively times down at the Laundry now and then , "
115082	115089	115091	115091	Violet	484	" You may depend I had ! "
115108	115150	115105	115105	She	319	" But of course it must be much more difficult here - especially for you , with eight floors to keep an eye on and so many different sorts of people too . We 'd no foreigners at the Laundry anyhow . "
115307	115316	115318	115319	Miss Maclaren	319	" What lipstick do you fancy , dear ? "
115326	115329	115331	115331	Violet	484	" Michel , "
115338	115386	115331	115331	Violet	484	" It 's a kind of an imitation of Tanger , you know . But I think it 's better . Not what you 'd call cheap , but it lasts for ages . If you ask me , I think the most expensive is the cheapest . "
115387	115390	115392	115393	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes ? "
115396	115421	115392	115393	Miss Maclaren	319	" I do n't know what mine is , really . But I know it 's about finished . Mrs. O'Riordan always had Chanel . "
115422	115435	115331	115331	Violet	484	" Yes . That 's one that lasts for ages , too . "
115473	115481	115482	115482	Violet	484	" Shall he put it on here ? "
115490	115493	115513	115514	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes . "
115507	115511	115513	115514	Miss Maclaren	319	" Thank you , "
115537	115546	115547	115548	The waiter	1350	" Will you sign , please , miss ? "
115554	115557	115558	115559	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! "
115603	115618	115592	115592	she	319	" Yes , this will be all I want . Thank you very much . "
115619	115625	115626	115627	The waiter	1350	" Thank you , miss . "
115630	115637	115639	115640	Miss Maclaren	319	" He 's learnt his lesson , "
115688	115693	115683	115683	she	319	" Milk ? Sugar ? "
115773	115785	115786	115786	she	484	" It must be rather fun , being head - housekeeper , "
115789	115799	115801	115802	Miss Maclaren	319	" Well , I suppose it is , dear , "
115826	115944	115821	115821	she	319	" I mean - it is and it is n't . Now Mr. Cousin asked me down for lunch to - day , and Mr. Orcham was there too . Naturally , I could n't refuse , though really I had n't a minute and they must have known it . Was n't as if they had much to tell me that was useful . No . Just talk . It 's extraordinary the amount of time men waste . I could have had my lunch in five minutes . Do you know , I was there over an hour . It was in Mr. Cousin 's room . I suppose they just wanted to be friendly . "
115945	115951	115952	115952	Violet	484	" And so they ought ! "
115956	115964	115952	115952	Violet	484	" But it was nice of them . "
115981	115987	115989	115990	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh , it was , "
116004	116016	115989	115990	Miss Maclaren	319	" And my word they do have meals , those two . "
116023	116191	116017	116019	The greedy woman	4143	" Mr. Cousin did n't say a lot , but Mr. Orcham did , and they were both full of Mrs. O'Riordan . Mr. Orcham 's made up his mind she sha n't have her wedding - present . He said he told her if she did n't come to the dinner she would n't get any present . And she did say she would come . So he 's sending the plate back to the silversmith 's , and he says he 's going to return all the subscriptions . That means ten shillings I never expected to see again . Oh ! He was very light and jolly about it . But he meant it . You could see that . And when he means a thing he does mean it , Mr. Orcham does . She ought n't to have run off like that . No ! I must say I was very surprised . I should never I have thought it of her . "
116192	116199	116201	116201	Violet	484	" I should think not indeed ! "
116203	116222	116201	116201	Violet	484	" But I think just before weddings women do get into a state . I 've noticed it . "
116223	116226	116227	116228	Miss Maclaren	319	" Really ? "
116232	116242	116227	116228	Miss Maclaren	319	" Still , she should n't have done it . "
116293	116301	116303	116304	Miss Maclaren	319	" In half an hour , Agatha , "
116318	116333	116334	116335	Miss Maclaren	319	" Have another of these little cakes - petty fours as they call them , "
116339	116351	116384	116384	Violet	484	" No , thanks . I ca n't eat any more . "
116352	116364	116384	116384	Violet	484	" You have n't had any jam . Do have some . "
116377	116383	116384	116384	Violet	484	" Another cup of tea ? "
116421	116429	116431	116431	she	484	" No use leaving anything for them , "
116447	116455	116456	116456	her	484	" The cakes that are no more ! "
116520	116534	116535	116535	she	484	" Very nice of you to arrange these rooms for me , Violet , "
116541	116578	116535	116535	she	484	" They christened me ' Mac ' in this place . But I 'm not going to have any ' Macs ' now - except of course when I 'm alone with someone , like this . "
116579	116582	116584	116584	Violet	484	" No , "
116586	116619	116584	116584	Violet	484	" It would n't do , would it ? I should have unpacked your trunks too ; but I thought perhaps I 'd better not . People prefer to do that themselves . "
116620	116626	116628	116629	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 've done it , "
116636	116647	116632	116632	You	4147	" said Violet , who was really impressed by this despatch .
116648	116658	116660	116661	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! That does n't take me long ! "
116663	116717	116660	116661	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 've done it too often . But hanging pictures and so on . No . I never seem to have a moment for that . Downstairs my pictures never were hung . And if you had n't hung them here , I do n't know when they would have been done . "
116758	116779	116780	116781	Miss Maclaren	319	" And what have you been doing on your first day ? I 've had to leave you to yourself . "
116787	116799	116784	116784	Violet	484	" I 'd better make my report , had n't I ? "
116814	116820	116821	116821	Violet	484	" Savott ? What number ? "
116829	116852	116821	116821	Violet	484	" But that was occupied by a Mr. - I forget his name , only it was n't Savott ; a Canadian . "
116853	116865	116784	116784	Violet	484	" Sir Henry came in last night , he told me . "
116866	116879	116881	116882	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 'm sure he is n't on the floor - list , "
116884	116913	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" That must be her ladyship again . She must have had the slip from the Reception Office - and forgotten it . Other things tooccupy her mind ! "
116927	116966	116967	116967	Violet	484	" You see , she was doing floor - housekeeper up here as well as head - housekeeper . You 'd have thought she could manage it , would n't you ? Well , what about the desk ? "
116983	116989	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" And did you go ? "
116990	117013	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" No , I sent for the head - carpenter . The valet said there was some spare furniture in his shop . "
117014	117020	117022	117023	Miss Maclaren	319	" Now that 's right , "
117025	117042	117022	117023	Miss Maclaren	319	" Send for them . Never go to them unless you ca n't possibly help it . "
117043	117075	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" Well , there was n't a desk - at least not one large enough . And Sir Henry wanted it green . I went to the shop myself to see . "
117076	117084	117022	117023	Miss Maclaren	319	" So you did n't get one ? "
117085	117137	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes , I did . I do n't know whether I did right or not , but I looked in all the empty rooms and I found a large desk in 847 . So I exchanged that one for the one in Sir Henry 's room . Was that right ? "
117138	117144	117146	117147	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes , it was , "
117149	117159	117146	117147	Miss Maclaren	319	" But the desk in 847 is n't green . "
117160	117171	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" It has some green lines picked out on it . "
117172	117177	117146	117147	Miss Maclaren	319	" So it has , "
117185	117194	117178	117179	Miss Maclaren	319	" How did you get the desks shifted ? "
117195	117214	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" I just asked the valet if he 'd get it done for me , and he did . "
117215	117221	117178	117179	Miss Maclaren	319	" Which valet was it ? "
117222	117232	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" Do n't know his name . Red hair . "
117233	117239	117178	117179	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! He did ? "
117240	117309	116914	116915	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes . I think the carpenters helped . I left them to do it and went away . When I came up from lunch it was done . I was very late for lunch . It took me about ten minutes to find where the place was . The housekeepers ' table was empty . But there were two page - boys eating in the same room . "
117310	117374	117178	117179	Miss Maclaren	319	" Well , dear , that was n't so bad for a first day . I do n't believe in page - boys having their meals in the same room as the floor - housekeepers . I 've often thought of it . It 's not nice . And I mean to get that altered if I can . What else ? Anything ? "
117416	117446	117404	117404	She	484	" I went to see him . He said he knew he 'd got bronchitis , and I thought he had too . So I sent for Dr. Constam . "
117447	117455	117404	117404	She	484	" Who told you about Dr. Constam ? "
117456	117485	117404	117404	She	484	" Marian Tilton . That 's her name , is n't it ? Mr. Cousin 's secretary . I telephoned down to her . She 's very obliging . "
117486	117494	117404	117404	She	484	" Yes . I suppose she is , "
117499	117535	117495	117496	Miss Maclaren	319	" But do n't you go and say too much to her . She 's the worst gossip in the hotel . I 'm always very careful with her . What did the doctor say ? "
117536	117548	117404	117404	She	484	" Oh ! It was bronchitis . But only a touch . "
117549	117572	117574	117575	Miss Maclaren	319	" He would n't have said it was only a touch if it had been a visitor on any of the floors , "
117577	117619	117404	117404	She	484	" Would n't he ? But I really think it was only a touch this time . I 've been to see the man since . I knew him , you see , before . I knew Sir Henry Savott too . "
117712	117723	117725	117726	Miss Maclaren	319	" Then you must know a lot about our business , "
117735	117767	117725	117726	Miss Maclaren	319	" I wish I 'd known this morning . I should n't have been so nervous for you . Mr. Cousin or Mr. Orcham might have told me , I think . "
117819	117897	117815	117815	Violet	484	" I 'm glad I told her . She might have heard one day and it would n't have done for her to think I had n't been open with her . She 's a nice old sort . No trouble about keeping in with her if you go about it right . She 's fussy , but she 's a great worker , and she knows her job and she 'll see that I do mine . "
117919	117924	117925	117925	she	319	" Oh , dear ! "
117931	117945	117925	117925	she	319	" Ca n't people leave me alone while I 'm having my tea ? "
117972	118019	118020	118021	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh ! Quite satisfactory , sir . She's ... Very well , sir ... To - night ? Yes , to - morrow morning would be better . Certainly , sir . I 'll arrange it ... Oh yes , sir . I can manage . "
118035	118241	118020	118021	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 'm sorry , Violet , but the orders are that you are to go down to Third to - morrow morning , and take over there . It was Mr. Cousin speaking . I do think it would have been better for you to stay up here with me for a bit , while you 're getting into it . But that 's the order . He did n't give any reason . But I should like to know whether I 'm head - housekeeper or not . It ought to be my business to decide what housekeeper is to be on what door . Miss Venables is doing Third and Fourth at present , and she might just as well go on doing them both , until you 're settled down . I thought we 'd settled it all at that lunch of theirs . I told them there was no need to have eight housekeepers . Waste of money , I told them . I can easily do Eighth myself , same as Mrs. O'Riordan had to do for a week and more . But I do wish you could have stayed with me . I 'm so sorry , dear . "
118242	118249	118250	118250	Violet	484	" So am I - Mac , "
118633	118642	118644	118645	Miss Maclaren	319	" Agatha will be here in a minute , "
118652	118680	118644	118645	Miss Maclaren	319	" I must dictate some letters . I 'm not very good at it . Did you have to do any dictating at the Laundry , dear ? "
118681	118691	118707	118708	Miss Maclaren	319	" Oh no ! Mr. Purkin did all that . "
118692	118705	118707	118708	Miss Maclaren	319	" He was a bit curt in his letters to Mrs. O'Riordan , "
118710	118716	118718	118718	Violet	484	" Yes , I daresay , "
118720	118731	118732	118732	she	484	" But I do n't think he means to be , "
118741	118751	118753	118753	she	484	" No . I 'm sure he does n't , "
118771	118778	118779	118779	she	484	" And talking of the Laundry , "
118783	118842	118779	118779	she	484	" the linen will be coming in about seven - you know when it leaves the Laundry - I wish you 'd see that it 's checked carefully , and I want you to look right through the linen - closets , and see if everything 's arranged for the best and report to me , will you ? "
118843	118847	118849	118849	Violet	484	" I will , "
118875	118881	118883	118884	Miss Maclaren	319	" Let me see now , "
118886	118910	118883	118884	Miss Maclaren	319	" This will be your late night . Midnight , you go off . Have you had any time off to - day ? "
118911	118926	118937	118938	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 've had plenty of time when there was n't anything to do . "
118927	118935	118937	118938	Miss Maclaren	319	" You ought to have gone out , "
118950	119007	118937	118938	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 'd like us to have another quiet chat to - night . Come along here about half - past eleven . I 'll expect you . But be sure to tell the night - waiter and the valet and the maid where you 're to be found . In case . You never know . "
119031	119046	119013	119014	Miss Maclaren	319	" You 've brought that correspondence I asked you for with the Works Department ? "
119047	119053	119013	119014	Miss Maclaren	319	" Yes , Miss Maclaren . "
119203	119214	119215	119215	Mac	484	" Have you packed at all , you poor dear ? "
119218	119230	119215	119215	Mac	484	" No . I sha n't think of it till morning . "
119231	119255	119163	119163	Mac	484	" That 's right . And do n't you go down a minute before nine o'clock . That 's your time on Third . "
119386	119395	119396	119396	she	484	" What a hell of an exciting day ! "
120037	120040	120041	120042	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , "
120046	120108	120041	120042	Sir Henry	296	" I 'll come back at once to my old rooms . I 've nothing to complain of upstairs , and the outlook is much finer there ; but it 's all too small . I find I ca n't manage . So if you do n't mind I 'll come back here this afternoon . About five . Not before . "
120109	120117	120019	120019	She	484	" Certainly , Sir Henry . Certainly . "
120118	120139	120140	120141	The two	748	" I shall have to leave all the moving to your people , without superintendence . My man 's ill . "
120159	120190	120156	120157	Sir Henry	296	" Now as regards this desk . There 's a desk in my sitting - room upstairs that I should prefer to this one . Can it be brought down ? "
120191	120199	120140	120141	The two	748	" Certainly , Sir Henry . Certainly . "
120235	120267	120230	120230	He	296	" I want one of these beds taken out . It 's only in the way . I had it removed before , but of course it 's been brought back again "
120268	120276	120306	120307	the clerk	4246	" Certainly , Sir Henry . Naturally . "
120277	120281	120230	120230	He	296	" Thank you . "
120286	120299	120302	120303	Sir Henry	296	" That will do , thanks . I 'll just look round , "
120328	120338	120339	120339	he	296	" So you 're down here now , Violet , "
120351	120357	120306	120307	the clerk	4246	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
120358	120420	120306	120307	the clerk	4246	" Well , I 'm glad I 've seen you . I did n't come across you again yesterday , and I did want to thank you for looking after Jim so well . He 's better . And he was very pleased to see you , very pleased . I went along to have a look at him this morning . "
120421	120425	120426	120426	Violet	484	" Oh yes ! "
120429	120461	120306	120307	the clerk	4246	" And there was another thing . You succeeded brilliantly in the affair of the desk , and I was much obliged . Have you got charge here to - day ? "
120462	120468	120306	120307	the clerk	4246	" Yes , Sir Henry . "
120469	120489	120492	120492	he	4248	" Well , that relieves my mind . I know I shall be safe . Goodbye for the present . "
120546	120554	120556	120556	Mac	484	" It 's a really bad stain ? "
120558	120561	120556	120556	Mac	484	" Frightful . "
120562	120572	120556	120556	Mac	484	" People are careless . How big is it ? "
120573	120581	120556	120556	Mac	484	" About a foot square at least . "
120582	120596	120556	120556	Mac	484	" All right . Do n't bother . I 'll see to it . "
120597	120606	120556	120556	Mac	484	" But can it be done before five ? "
120607	120642	120556	120556	Mac	484	" Of course . Look under one of the corners of the carpet . Does n't matter which . You 'll see a tab with a number on it . Give me the number . "
120702	120709	120711	120711	Mac	484	" And I say , Violet , "
120713	120773	120711	120711	Mac	484	" There 's just come up another order . You are to come back to Eighth this afternoon . I do n't know why . But I expect it 's struck them at last that what I said to them about your being up here with me for a bit was only common sense . I 'm so glad . "
120774	120779	120780	120780	Violet	484	" So am I , "
120849	120854	120842	120843	Miss Maclaren	319	" I 'm so glad "
120953	120957	120948	120948	she	9790	" Violet thought . "
120971	121155	120965	120965	We	4266	" Yet she well knew that they differed in at least one important aspect . Both of them conscientious and industrious , Mac was victimised by a tendency to harassed gloom , but Violet was animated by a tendency to cheerfulness . Violet had a desire always to lift Mac out of a pit of depression , and she was aware that the satisfaction of the desire would demand a slightly wearisome continuous moral effort on her part . She felt sorry for Mac , more sorry for her than fond of her . And in some strange way she felt sorry also for Sir Henry Savott ; felt as though she ought to remain on Third until he was entirely comfortable there , until she had assured herself that all his requirements , whatever they might be , had been fulfilled . She had a personal relation to Sir Henry , and nobody on the staff could understand his temperament as she understood it . At bottom , beneath all his imperious demeanour , he was a bit helpless , was Sir Henry .
121221	121237	121248	121248	his	4273	" Excuse me , Mr. Perosi - you are Mr. Perosi , are n't you ? "
121259	121284	121248	121248	his	4273	" I do n't know a thing yet about flowers here . And I want some for this suite . What do I do ? "
121285	121302	121248	121248	his	4273	" You telephone down to the flower - shop . You know the flower - shop ? "
121303	121309	121248	121248	his	4273	" Never heard of it . "
121310	121488	121248	121248	his	4273	" It 's on the right in the corridor between the hall and the grill - room . They always have carnations and roses . And if you want any special flowers for a visitor at any time , you can always get them . A visitor orders a bouquet of orchids at midnight - well any time after eight o'clock you telephone to the manager 's office . They have a key of the shop there when it 's closed , and whoever is on duty opens the shop and sends you up orchids - or anything else . Of course in the ordinary way all flowers are taken out of the sitting - rooms at seven in the morning every morning , and the vases put into the corridor and they go down to the flower - shop to be examined . They 're back again before nine , changed or freshened , you see . Bedroom flowers are changed when the visitors have left their rooms . It is very simple , Miss Powler . "
121489	121492	121493	121493	Violet	353	" Oh ! "
121497	121520	121493	121493	Violet	353	" You are kind . I was wondering how it was all arranged . Thanks very much . Sorry to trouble you . "
121526	121532	121493	121493	Violet	353	" He knows my name . "
121542	121569	121570	121570	He	480	" If you want to know anything else , come and ask me . Fourth is the floor to find me . End of the corridor . "
121573	121584	121493	121493	Violet	353	" There was something else , but I ought n't - "
121585	121588	121589	121589	Perosi	480	" What ? "
121594	121630	121589	121589	Perosi	480	" I hardly like to ask you . But I 've decided to try to learn French . I suppose there are plenty of Frenchmen on your staff , Mr. Perosi . I only thought - "
121631	121636	121638	121638	Perosi	480	" I 'm French , "
121645	121684	121640	121640	his	480	" My father was born in Milan , but I 'm French . So you wish to learn French ? That is good . I will see . Come to me to - night . I will see . "
121685	121699	121589	121589	Perosi	480	" You are kind . But I 'm returning to Eighth this afternoon . "
121700	121713	121714	121714	He	480	" And then ? What does that matter ? Telephone to me . "
121720	121728	121729	121729	Violet	353	" Why do n't they like him ? "
121737	121743	121729	121729	Violet	353	" He 's a dear . "
122142	122148	122139	122139	he	432	" And not too soon ! "
122254	122265	122266	122266	He	432	" Ce sont des barbares , les New - Yorkais . "
122325	122328	122331	122334	the Commendatore " maniglia	11497	" manila , "
122333	122336	122331	122334	the Commendatore " maniglia	11497	" maniglia , "
122539	122545	122547	122547	he	4296	" I 'm not late , "
122549	122560	122547	122547	he	4296	" But I 'm not used to these early hours . "
122617	122624	122625	122625	he	4296	" Where 's my friend Cousin ? "
122628	122636	122638	122639	Major Linklater	457	" Coming , sir - we hope , "
122641	122646	122648	122648	Evelyn	290	" Damn that hammering , "
122650	122656	122657	122657	He	4296	" I must stop it . "
122660	122668	122670	122671	the Major	4326	" That 's what we all say , "
122723	122732	122734	122734	Adolphe	326	" You have only to rise , sir , "
122736	122754	122734	122734	Adolphe	326	" I 'm sure Mr. Cousin wo n't mind if we start - will he , Pozzi ? "
122755	122761	122802	122803	The Commendatore	4296	" Certainly not , sir . "
122768	122771	122773	122773	Evelyn	290	" Ah ! "
122775	122801	122773	122773	Evelyn	290	" Hot hors d'ouvre ! So you 're going on with that idea of yours , Commendatore . I 've not had this one before . "
122806	122875	122876	122876	He	4296	" My director , no one has had this before . I invent six new ones every day . Another two days , and it will be a month since I began . That will make one hundred and eighty - six new combinations . That is work , if I may dare to say so . I have been reserving this one expressly for to - day . "
122899	122940	122876	122876	He	4296	" Yes , truly it is not bad . The mushrooms , prepared like this ... It is necessary to drink sherry with it . As for me , I never touch sherry ; but sherry should go with it . "
122964	122967	122968	122968	he	4296	" Vittel , "
122987	122987	122974	122975	the Commendatore	4296	"
122995	123016	123017	123017	His	4296	" Of course you do not . The restaurant is only the restaurant , but the grill is the grill . "
123022	123035	123017	123017	His	4296	" My director , if once you would come to the grill - "
123036	123045	123046	123046	Evelyn	290	" I will . Demain , sans faute , "
123049	123061	123017	123017	His	4296	" I shall be too honoured , my director . Lunch ? "
123062	123065	123017	123017	His	4296	" Lunch . "
123066	123080	123017	123017	His	4296	" I shall give myself the pleasure of occupying myself with it specially . "
123454	123460	123462	123462	he	458	" Mr. Cousin is detained , "
123470	123475	123462	123462	he	458	" Sir Henry Savott . "
123476	123481	123482	123482	Evelyn	290	" What about Savott ? "
123485	123495	123462	123462	he	458	" It is he who is detaining Mr. Cousin . "
123506	123551	123504	123504	himself	290	" Manager 's office , please ... that you , Cousin ? Orcham speaking . You have Sir Henry Savott with you . I only wanted to tell you this . There is no accommodation on Eighth . You understand? ... Yes . Right . "
123619	123636	123605	123605	Evelyn	290	" Well , Adolphe , how are you getting on with that novel I lent you ? "
123693	123702	123704	123704	Adolphe	326	" I finished it last night , sir , "
123706	123751	123704	123704	Adolphe	326	" I should call it mild . The chapter in the underground bakehouse between the girl and the baker nude down to the waist is not bad , but I 'm afraid they would n't think much of its realism in Czecho - Slovakia . "
123766	123774	123776	123777	Major Linklater	457	" Now do n't boast , Adolphe , "
123779	123795	123776	123777	Major Linklater	457	" You are n't a Czecho - Slovakian . You wish to heaven you were . "
123796	123802	123803	123803	Adolphe	326	" I very nearly was , "
123807	123820	123822	123823	Major Linklater	457	" Yes , we 've heard that story about a million times , "
123825	123834	123822	123823	Major Linklater	457	" So spare us , my beamish boy . "
123835	123851	123852	123852	Adolphe	326	" I wish somebody would tell me the meaning of that word ' beamish ' , "
123855	123863	123852	123852	Adolphe	326	" It is n't in the dictionary . "
123864	123871	123873	123874	the Major	4326	" And it never will be , "
123876	123949	123873	123874	the Major	4326	" It would set any dictionary on fire , and there 'd be a smell of sulphur . You have to be English and you have to have your name put down for it when you 're eight years old , and then perhaps the high - priest will vouchsafe to you its meaning when you 're eighteen . Otherwise you have n't an earthly . Tell us about the bakehouse scene . "
123988	124017	123980	123981	Major Linklater	457	" May I have that book , sir , after Adolphe ? I should love to know what Adolphe thinks would be thought mild in Czecho - Slovakia . "
124018	124030	124032	124032	Evelyn	290	" I 'll make a present of it to the mess , "
124034	124046	124032	124032	Evelyn	290	" Then you can talk bawdy and everyone can join in . "
124047	124051	124053	124055	young Dr. Constam	438	" Dr. Johnson , "
124057	124061	124063	124064	Major Linklater	457	" Noble sir ! "
124066	124076	124063	124064	Major Linklater	457	" Gentlemen ! The health of the noble Director . "
124118	124123	124124	124125	the Commendatore	4296	" Serve me first , "
124131	124141	124142	124142	He	4296	" I am not very sure of this dish . "
124145	124149	124150	124150	he	4296	" That goes , "
124164	124172	124174	124175	the Director	745	" This is quite new to me , "
124177	124183	124185	124186	the Commendatore	4296	" Yes , my director , "
124191	124197	124185	124186	the Commendatore	4296	" And to the world . "
124198	124205	124207	124208	Major Linklater	457	" First time on any stage ! "
124210	124224	124207	124208	Major Linklater	457	" Gentlemen , we drink to the success of the Commendatore 's novelty . "
124247	124257	124239	124239	his	438	" I have a piece of really stupendous news . "
124258	124263	124264	124264	Evelyn	290	" Do n't hesitate , "
124268	124275	124239	124239	his	438	" Perosi has at last fallen . "
124276	124283	124284	124284	Adolphe	326	" Down the lift - well ? "
124287	124292	124293	124294	Dr. Constam	438	" For a woman . "
124302	124309	124293	124294	Dr. Constam	438	" Beat that if you can ! "
124310	124316	124239	124239	his	438	" What ! Old flatfoot ? "
124317	124379	124293	124294	Dr. Constam	438	" The same . I think his relations with our glittering bevy of housekeepers have always been very correct . But distant . Oh yes , distant . Well , I happened to meet him this morning , and it 's a positive fact that he began all on his own talking about the new housekeeper - I forget her name . "
124380	124390	124391	124392	Major Linklater	457	" Did n't know there was a new housekeeper , "
124395	124409	124411	124411	Adolphe	326	" No . You 're always a month or so behind the times , "
124413	124438	124411	124411	Adolphe	326	" If the Palace was burnt down you would n't hear of it till it 'd been rebuilt . Well , who is she ? "
124439	124445	124447	124447	Evelyn	290	" Her name is Powler , "
124449	124452	124453	124454	Dr. Constam	438	" Well , "
124457	124493	124453	124454	Dr. Constam	438	" As I say , he began talking about her . Said she was very agreeable and serious . And she wants to learn French , and he 's going to give her lessons himself . "
124494	124502	124503	124503	Adolphe	326	" No bakehouse scenes , I hope . "
124523	124531	124533	124533	Evelyn	290	" He used to be a schoolmaster , "
124536	124551	124533	124533	Evelyn	290	" Commendatore , tell me something about this most distinguished sauce , will you ? "
124599	124609	124611	124611	Evelyn	290	" Your chief does n't seem to be coming , "
124613	124628	124673	124673	Pozzi	458	" Does n't look like it ... Will you make the presentation , sir ? "
124629	124634	124636	124636	Evelyn	290	" Most assuredly not , "
124638	124670	124636	124636	Evelyn	290	" This is a hotel - staff affair . If Mr. Cousin is n't here , you 're his second - in - command , and you must perform the ceremony . "
124754	124763	124765	124765	Evelyn	290	" I think I may add one thing , "
124767	124790	124765	124765	Evelyn	290	" Rocco has the ideal temperament for a good golfer . It 's like a rock . Gentlemen , fill your glasses . "
124906	124916	124917	124917	Immerson	348	" Can you spare me a minute , sir ? "
125056	125069	125052	125052	he	348	" My Christian names , sir . An omen . A signpost . "
125076	125079	125070	125070	His	348	" Frederick Gordon "
125117	125187	125113	125113	he	348	" It 's no use waiting for business to come in You have to go out and get it . And you wo n't get it by display - ads of the kind you 're putting now in London dailies . Londoners do n't use London hotels , except their restaurants , and even if your restaurant is full your hotel wo n't pay if your bedrooms are empty . "
125267	125270	125250	125250	He	348	" Imperial Palace "
125300	125303	125288	125288	He	348	" Imperial Palace "
125408	125412	125413	125413	Evelyn	290	" This boy , "
125419	125442	125413	125413	Evelyn	290	" must be co - opted to the Board as soon as Lingmell has the grace to retire - if not sooner . "
125443	125447	125448	125448	Immerson	348	" Forgive me , "
125458	125475	125448	125448	Immerson	348	" No doubt you have noticed the drop in North Atlantic shares these last few days . "
125494	125497	125479	125495	the illustrious company which owned the fleet of liners all of whose names ended in " us	11560	" us . "
125498	125503	125504	125504	Evelyn	290	" I have not , "
125507	125522	125504	125504	Evelyn	290	" Why should I ? Because transatlantic liners are called ' floating hotels ' ? "
125523	125553	125413	125413	Evelyn	290	" They fell several shillings yesterday , and they 're falling still more to - day . And to - morrow they 'll probably go down with a bump . "
125554	125557	125504	125504	Evelyn	290	" Why ? "
125558	125640	125413	125413	Evelyn	290	" The ' Daily Mercury ' is coming out to - morrow with a terrific stunt about that splitting of one of the decks on the ' Caractacus ' . They 've been collecting all the details , and they 've found a woman who had her thigh broken in a lurch of the ship during the voyage . The Company has paid her handsomely to hold her tongue , but some women ca n't rely on themselves to do that . "
125647	125703	125641	125641	Immerson	348	" The ' Daily Mercury ' is bound to lose some steamer advertising , but it does n't carry much , and it reckons that what it loses on the swings it will make on the roundabouts . Anyhow the story'll be a great story . It 's quite possible that traffic will be affected . "
125704	125709	125504	125504	Evelyn	290	" Not for long . "
125710	125867	125641	125641	Immerson	348	" No . But even a month is too long for us . If traffic 's affected we shall be affected . You see - forgive me for reminding you , sir - the ' Caractacus ' is German built , and there are several other German - built ships on the New York services . They 'll all be affected , especially as the ' Caractacus ' is laid up for what 's called reconditioning . The ' Mercury ' will go on the anti - German lay . I 've been to the North Atlantic people this morning and offered them a few hints on how to react . And I 'm going again this afternoon , if you approve , sir . I think I can get something in one of to - morrow 's papers , the ' Echo ' - it has a bigger circulation than even the ' Mercury ' . "
125868	125874	125876	125876	Evelyn	290	" You go right on , "
125878	125885	125876	125876	Evelyn	290	" I leave it to you . "
125886	125902	125641	125641	Immerson	348	" Thank you , sir . But I have n't come to the point yet . "
125903	125906	125876	125876	Evelyn	290	" Oh ? "
125907	126002	125641	125641	Immerson	348	" No , sir . From what I hear , our friend Sir Henry Savott is at the bottom of all this . He 's a very large shareholder in North Atlantic , and my private information is that one reason for the fall in the shares is that he 's been unloading heavily . He 'll buy in again when the fall has reached its limit , and he might make a couple of hundred thousand over the thing in the end ... No , not that much ; but quite a lot . "
126003	126012	125876	125876	Evelyn	290	" Is he a director of North Atlantic ? "
126013	126055	125641	125641	Immerson	348	" Oh no , sir . If he had been he dare n't have done it . No ! He 's far too clever to be a director . But I daresay he has a director or two in his pocket . "
126056	126059	126061	126061	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
126068	126108	126061	126061	Evelyn	290	" It 's all very interesting - very interesting indeed . When you say that Savott is at the bottom of it , do you mean he 's at the bottom of the ' Mercury ' stunt as well ? "
126109	126118	126119	126119	Immerson	348	" Nothing would surprise me less , sir , "
126125	126131	126133	126133	Evelyn	290	" I must go now , "
126152	126161	126162	126162	Immerson	348	" Pardon me for detaining you , sir , "
126563	126598	126558	126559	father Dennis	399	" I ca n't live for ever . What will happen to my shares if I die ? My grand - nephew will happen to them , because nobody else can happen to them . "
126791	126795	126829	126829	they	4446	" Daily Mercury , "
127512	127522	127523	127523	he	334	" Do you know Sir Henry Savott 's valet ? "
127538	127552	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Well , sir , I know him . He 's been ill . "
127553	127560	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Yes , so I heard . "
127561	127606	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" I do n't really know him . As you may see , sir , when I tell you he 's never told me his surname . But we 've had one or two chats . He being a valet , and me too . "
127607	127616	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Ever talked to him about our housekeepers ? "
127617	127628	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Well , sir , we may have mentioned it . "
127629	127634	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" He asked you ? "
127635	127664	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Now I come to think of it , I believe he did speak about the new one - Miss Powler . Just in the way of talk . "
127665	127672	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Did you tell him anything ? "
127673	127781	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" No , sir . I could n't . I did n't know anything , except she 'd come from the Laundry . Seems she used to be with Sir Henry , sir . He told me that . Else I doubt if I should have remembered it . Yes , and he asked me what floor she was on , and I told him . Then when I saw him day before yesterday - was it ? - and he was up and about , and Miss Powler had been moved to Third , he happened to ask me what floor she 'd been moved to . "
127782	127788	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" And you told him ? "
127789	127794	127492	127492	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir . "
127795	127798	127800	127800	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
127809	127824	127800	127800	Evelyn	290	" I wish you would n't gossip about hotel affairs to visitors ' servants . "
127845	127850	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" Sorry , sir , "
127869	127884	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" That 's all . What do you want ? I did n't ring . "
127885	127914	127915	127915	Oldham	329	" No , sir . The fact is I 've just heard something , and I thought you might like to know . Sorry if it 's inconvenient . "
127926	127931	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" What is it ? "
127932	127957	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" Well , sir . It 's like this . I 've won that thousand pounds . I 've had a letter this minute . "
127958	127963	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" What thousand pounds ? "
127964	128001	127851	127851	Oldham	329	" Football Results Competition , sir . It 'll be in next Sunday 's paper . I have to call and see them myself to get the cheque . And they want me to be photographed . "
128002	128007	128009	128009	Evelyn	290	" I congratulate you , "
128016	128032	128009	128009	Evelyn	290	" It 's the best piece of news I 've heard for a long time . "
128033	128039	128041	128041	Oldham	329	" Thank you , sir , "
128195	128204	128205	128205	he	329	" So I expect you 'll be leaving ? "
128223	128236	128237	128237	Oldham	329	" I wo n't leave you till it suits you , sir , "
128240	128262	128237	128237	Oldham	329	" Certainly not . You 've always been very kind to me , sir , and I 'd like to be - "
128471	128481	128483	128483	Evelyn	290	" That 's very good of you , Oldham , "
128485	128499	128483	128483	Evelyn	290	" But of course you must tell me when . Got any plans ? "
128500	128556	128575	128576	a tobacconist	4486	" Well , sir , I was thinking I might do worse than buy a little tobacconist 's business . You see them advertised . I saw one the other day on sale for two hundred pounds cash . Camberwell . Camberwell 's a very nice part , do n't you think so , sir ? "
128557	128565	128483	128483	Evelyn	290	" Yes , I think it is . "
128752	128755	128757	128757	Evelyn	290	" Excellent ! "
128764	128830	128757	128757	Evelyn	290	" But be careful how you buy . You 'd better consult me before you do anything . Or better still , talk to someone down in the audit office . You 'd need an expert to go into the figures . I 've heard some funny tales about this business - buying business . There are swindlers who make a regular trade of it . "
128831	128834	128836	128836	Oldham	329	" Oh ! "
128846	128884	128836	128836	Oldham	329	" I shall be careful . I think I may say you know me , sir . But I 'm much obliged to you , sir , and when the time comes I shall ask your advice . "
129089	129103	129105	129106	Sir Henry	296	" You taught me something that honestly I did n't know about cigars , "
129145	129175	129132	129132	He	296	" But I 'm certain to forget . I always light a cigar about five times . It 's a habit , and I shall never get over it . "
129180	129195	129197	129197	Evelyn	290	" You did n't forget last time , once I 'd made my protest , "
129199	129204	129205	129206	Sir Henry	296	" Did n't I ? "
129372	129431	129365	129366	Sir Henry	296	" I am a great man , a unique man , and if I choose to relight a cigar , it 's correct because I do it . I can afford to treat a cigar as I please , and I sha n't risk any prestige by my oddness . I 'm Sir Henry Savott , I am . "
129647	129672	129641	129641	Evelyn	290	" I was just thinking about the ' Caractacus ' fireworks in the ' Mercury ' this morning . I suppose you saw it ? "
129673	129676	129678	129678	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
129681	129764	129678	129678	Evelyn	290	" It was what they call ' brought to my notice . ' I also saw the North Atlantic reply this afternoon in the ' Echo . ' What they said about the split being caused by structural alterations of their own to make room for extra lifts was rather effective , I thought . It gives their architect away , but it sounds true , and if it 's true it does save the reputation of the ship as originally built . "
129765	129772	129774	129775	Sir Henry	296	" The reply was very clever , "
129777	129780	129782	129782	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
129784	129811	129782	129782	Evelyn	290	" and if I told you it had been put together by one of the fellows on my staff here you might be a bit startled . "
129812	129815	129816	129817	Sir Henry	296	" Only , "
129821	129860	129816	129817	Sir Henry	296	" it came out about two hours too late . The North Atlantic market had gone to pieces before noon . The shares recovered a trifle this afternoon , but not much . They 've had a tousling . "
129899	130299	129895	129895	Evelyn	290	" The ' Mercury ' people came to see me about the thing last week . They wanted my evidence . I refused to tell them anything , naturally . But of course I had to be careful . If I 'd shut my mouth absolutely they 'd have used that to support their story , me being a very large holder of North Atlantics . So I pretended to be very open - and did n't give away anything that is n't known to at least five hundred people . You know , the comfort of those crack hell - for - leather liners is one of the most ridiculous legends ever invented by our reptile press . When I say ' reptile ' I 'm saying it in a Parliamentary sense . The papers are n't bribed . They do n't keep the legend alive for money . The biggest steamer advertisement is nothing to a big daily . No . They keep it alive because it sounds so nice . Good copy . Symbol of luxury , and everybody wants to read about luxury . But even in good weather those rushers positively shake half the time . It is n't a mere vibration . It 's like having electric massage all day , including at meals . And in bad weather they 're no better than 12,000 tonners . Not as good . Some of 'em roll till sometimes the only way to keep yourself upright is to lie flat on the deck . They 're liable to throw piles of plates across the dining - saloon , and chuck you all over your cabin . They drop from under you until you think your stomach 's above your head . I mean in bad weather . The food is n't too awful , considering they have to serve five or six hundred people at once . But nobody can feed five or six hundred at once on really good food . It ca n't be done . And the prices are insane . I paid L1,000 for my suite last time I came over . And there was a bigger ass than me on board . He paid thirteen hundred . And the tips ! All for 27knots ! Well , I prefer 18 or 19 knots . I 'll never do it again . "
130306	130339	130303	130303	Evelyn	290	" On New Year 's Eve here I shall serve a thousand people at once , and the food will not be too awful . It 'll be the best there is . "
130340	130343	130345	130346	Sir Henry	296	" Ah ! "
130348	130354	130345	130346	Sir Henry	296	" But you are you . "
130355	130366	130303	130303	Evelyn	290	" You try it - on New Year 's Eve . "
130367	130371	130373	130374	Sir Henry	296	" I will , "
130376	130385	130373	130374	Sir Henry	296	" I 'll make a pointof trying it . "
130399	130407	130408	130408	he	296	" I do n't mind telling you , "
130417	130452	130408	130408	he	296	" as soon as the ' Mercury ' people had been to see me I began to sell my North Atlantics . I sold a big packet , and I kept on selling 'em . "
130453	130461	130463	130463	Evelyn	290	" And now you 'll buy back , "
130466	130474	130475	130476	Sir Henry	296	" And now I shall buy back , "
130479	130535	130475	130476	Sir Henry	296	" I bought a lot this morning at rock bottom , and a lot more this afternoon a bit higher , and I 'm ready for more to - morrow . I shall clear quite a lump of money on the ' Mercury ' stunt . Well , one must live ... And why not ? "
130542	130547	130536	130536	Evelyn	290	" And why not ? "
130785	130790	130792	130793	Sir Henry	296	" By the way , "
130795	130816	130792	130793	Sir Henry	296	" I had a long talk with your man Cousin yesterday . In the end I asked him to lunch . "
130817	130826	130827	130827	Evelyn	290	" What 's he going to say now ? "
130892	130913	130888	130889	Sir Henry	296	" I heard by accident that Cousin had been connected with the Concorde in Paris and the Minerva at Cannes - "
130914	130927	130928	130928	Evelyn	290	" Yes , he was manager of the Minerva for a time , "
130931	130971	130888	130889	Sir Henry	296	" So he said . Well , as both the Concorde and the Minerva are included in my proposed team , it struck me it might be useful to get some independent views about them . So I did . "
130972	130979	130981	130981	Evelyn	290	" I hope you were satisfied , "
130986	131037	130888	130889	Sir Henry	296	" Here I go again ! Wrong again ! I imagined he was manouvring with Cousin to get back to Eighth . And he was n't at all . This suspiciousness is growing on me . If I let it , I shall soon be as suspicious as a millionaire . "
131038	131043	131044	131045	Sir Henry	296	" On the whole , "
131048	131072	131044	131045	Sir Henry	296	" I was very well satisfied with the look of things . You do n't mind me talking to him , do you ? "
131073	131077	131079	131079	Evelyn	290	" Certainly not , "
131081	131087	131079	131079	Evelyn	290	" Why should n't you ? "
131088	131106	131044	131045	Sir Henry	296	" I need n't tell you I did n't ask him anything about this place . No . "
131110	131122	131107	131107	Evelyn	290	" It would have been just the same if you had . "
131140	131153	131132	131132	He	296	" Well , what 's your decision about my proposal , Orcham ? "
131174	131177	131178	131178	He	296	" Decision ? "
131184	131216	131217	131217	He	296	" Why ! I do n't even know what the proposal is yet . You do n't expect me to say Yes or No to a mere idea , do you ? "
131333	131338	131340	131341	the financier	4537	" You misunderstand me , "
131348	131427	131340	131341	the financier	4537	" All I meant was : Have you decided to examine my proposition ? Or not . If not , I wo n't trouble you any further . If yes , I 'll put the entire scheme before you within the next day or two . All the figures and calculations . And a definite offer as to price for Imperial Palace shares , and also of course as to the terms of the contract with you personally . "
131624	131628	131629	131629	he	290	" Of course , "
131637	131657	131629	131629	he	290	" Of course we shall be charmed to examine the proposal . Let us know when you 're ready . "
131670	131676	131678	131679	Sir Henry	296	" Good ! I will , "
131694	131721	131688	131688	Evelyn	290	" My God ! My God ! If anyone had foretold this to me a month ago I should have - My God ! My God ! "
131751	131755	131757	131758	Sir Henry	296	" I say , "
131760	131784	131757	131758	Sir Henry	296	" There was one thing I wanted to mention to you . Nothing to do with this . About that girl Violet Powler . "
131785	131788	131789	131789	Evelyn	290	" Yes ? "
131796	131968	131969	131969	Savott	296	" You 've only got to say no , and you can forget I 've spoken . I 'll forget too . I 'm buying a new house . I shall want a housekeeper . Do n't shoot me , I know she 's in your employ , and to lose her might be rather inconvenient for you . I admit she 's one in a thousand . But I knew her first . And she knows me . Now would you mind if I made her an offer of the job of housekeeper at my new house ? I wo n't breathe it if you object . And in any case I would n't try to over - persuade her . No ! I 'd say : ' There it is , miss . Take it or leave it . ' You see I 'm being quite open . Perhaps I 'm asking too much . Perhaps it is n't fair . I just mention it - that 's all . "
132005	132010	132011	132011	Evelyn	290	" My dear fellow , "
132014	132033	132011	132011	Evelyn	290	" Naturally you must ask her . I would n't dream of standing in the girl 's way . "
132057	132061	132063	132064	Sir Henry	296	" Delightful castle ! "
132074	132096	132063	132064	Sir Henry	296	" I love it . And once more - you 're really very kind . I appreciate it . Good night . "
132385	132388	132389	132389	she	4565	" Fire ! "
132633	132638	132639	132639	he	290	" All right now , "
132817	132825	132826	132826	she	4579	" I was having a hot bath , "
132830	132835	132826	132826	she	4579	" So I see . "
132836	132853	132892	132892	she	4579	" And I got out to open the window because I was afraid I might faint - "
132854	132863	132864	132864	Evelyn	290	" You are n't all alone in here ? "
132867	132886	132892	132892	she	4579	" No . My husband is there . But he 's asleep and nothing would ever waken him . "
132933	132941	132942	132942	Evelyn	290	" Well , do n't take cold , "
132996	133006	133008	133011	the ageing big man	4590	" I thought I heard a scream , sir , "
133018	133061	133008	133011	the ageing big man	4590	" You did . But you 've got very good ears . It 's all over . Spirit - lamp in the bathroom in 415 . I 've put it right . Hysterical woman . The usual thing . Who are they ? "
133062	133091	133008	133011	the ageing big man	4590	" I ca n't remember the name exactly . It 's a queer name . The lady seems to be English . But the gentleman is a Roumanian . "
133092	133097	133099	133099	Evelyn	290	" He would be , "
133105	133121	133099	133099	Evelyn	290	" Well , you need n't trouble any more . I 've seen to it . "
133122	133128	133129	133129	Perosi	480	" Thank you , sir . "
133178	133187	133189	133189	he	480	" I wish to tell you , sir , "
133193	133237	133189	133189	he	480	" I 'm giving lessons in French to Miss Powler . She is very anxious to learn . I told Dr. Constam yesterday morning and Mr. Pozzi this afternoon . There 's no secret about it . I hope you approve , sir . "
133238	133257	133259	133259	He	480	" Of course , Perosi . By the way , I want a word with Miss Powler . Miss Powler!"
133267	133273	133265	133265	Perosi	480	" Thank you , Perosi . "
133579	133584	133588	133588	her	353	" Yes , sir ? "
133608	133616	133617	133617	he	480	" I hear you 're learning French , "
133620	133637	133617	133617	he	480	" It 's a very good idea . And you have n't lost time over beginning . "
133740	133761	133765	133765	his	480	" This will save me the trouble of sending for you . I had something I wanted to tell you . "
133774	133779	133765	133765	his	480	" Yes , sir ? "
133780	133877	133765	133765	his	480	" I 've been seeing Sir Henry Savott to - night . Sir Henry has bought or is just buying a new house , and he asked me whether I should object if he offered you the post of housekeeper . He said of course you 'd worked for him already - before you worked for us . I said I should n't dream of standing in your way . You 're absolutely free . Under your contract we can give you notice and you can give us notice . A month , is n't it ? "
133878	133883	133765	133765	his	480	" Yes , sir . "
133884	133994	133995	133995	He	4605	" Yes . A month . Well , that 's how it stands . I thought I would let you know - in fact ought to let you know - what you may expect , and that you 're under no sort of obligation to me , to us , beyond the terms of your contract . If we thought we ought to dismiss you , naturally we should dismiss you . Not that we 've the least notion of doing that . Far from it . But we should feel ourselves at liberty to do it . And just the same you 're at liberty to dismiss us . "
134011	134029	134008	134008	She	353	" Thank you , sir . It 's a thing that will need a lot of thinking over .
134030	134036	134037	134037	Evelyn	290	" Yes . Good night . "
134052	134058	134037	134037	Evelyn	290	" Good night , sir . "
134059	134078	134079	134079	he	4605	" And no doubt now she 'll proceed with her French lesson , as if nothing had happened ! "
134174	134260	134169	134169	They	4607	" We do n't expect you to leave us like this . You 've just come . We 've taken you into the first hotel in the world . You ought to regard yourself as extremely fortunate . We ca n't have our staff playing fast and loose . Sir Henry Savott ought never to have made such an extraordinary suggestion . Now he has made it we look to you to realise that you have a moral duty to us , and we hope - "
134288	134302	134279	134280	the girl	796	" It 's a thing that will need a lot of thinking over . "
134354	134566	134350	134351	This man	4615	" I must be fair . She had something to hire out , and I hired it . In hiring her I did n't confer a favour on her . I hired her , not for her advantage , but for the advantage of the Palace . If I had n't thought she would be a splendid asset to the Palace I should have left her where she was at the Laundry . The change may be a grand thing for her , but that was n't why I engaged her . The notion of a moral duty on her part is simply preposterous . It makes me think of the sickening attitude people take up to their servants in private houses . The girl 's absolutely entitled to give the question ' a lot of thinking over , ' and to decide solely in her own interests , and to ignore my interests . Savott could certainly pay her a much better salary than we could , and in his house she would n't have anybody over her - except him . And he would n't worry her . No chain of responsibility there . The truth is she 'd be an idiot not to jump at Savott 's offer . "
134746	134750	134718	134718	HOUSEKEEPERS	10312	" Imperial Palace . "
134805	134810	134798	134798	she	353	" Hy . Savott . "
134815	134820	134798	134798	she	353	" Dear Miss Powler , "
135249	135258	135259	135259	Violet	484	" Oh , sorry ! I did n't - "
135271	135282	135283	135283	Mac	484	" Come in , dear . Come in , please ! "
135395	135403	135405	135405	Mac	484	" Venables thinks she 's overworked here , "
135407	135413	135415	135416	Miss Venables	491	" Yes , I do , "
135567	135575	135577	135577	Mac	484	" What do you think , Violet ? "
135579	135585	135577	135577	Mac	484	" What 's your opinion ? "
135601	135666	135591	135592	Miss Venables	491	" At least I do n't say I 'm overworked - so long as I 'm left alone to do my work as I 've always done it . I do n't even mind doing both Third and Fourth for a time , to oblige the management . I always gave satisfaction to Mrs. O'Riordan , and she was n't easy to please either . "
135762	135765	135767	135768	Miss Prentiss	478	" Well , "
135770	135786	135767	135768	Miss Prentiss	478	" I think we 're overworked , and I do n't care who knows it . "
135951	135961	135934	135937	the two Miss Prentiss	478	" Well , what do you say , Violet ? "
135962	135970	135971	135971	Violet	484	" I think our hours are long , "
135976	135986	135971	135971	Violet	484	" But I should n't say we were overworked . "
135987	135994	135995	135996	Miss Venables	491	" Oh ! Would n't you ! "
135999	136048	135995	135996	Miss Venables	491	" Well , wait till you 've been here a bit longer . You forget that we 've all been trying to help you , Miss Powler - Mac particularly . You 're such great friends . But you wait till you 've been here a bit longer . "
136049	136052	136053	136054	Miss Prentiss	478	" Yes . "
136059	136082	136053	136054	Miss Prentiss	478	" You 've got friends here . Mr. Orcham brought you . Do n't think we do n't know all about it . "
136083	136093	136095	136095	Violet	484	" Mr. Orcham is n't a friend of mine , "
136098	136114	136095	136095	Violet	484	" I scarcely know him . He asked me to come here and I came . "
136115	136118	136120	136121	Miss Prentiss	478	" Yes , "
136123	136143	136120	136121	Miss Prentiss	478	" And I suppose he did n't take you down to the basement and show you everything there himself . "
136144	136151	136153	136153	Violet	484	" But I told you that , "
136155	136164	136120	136121	Miss Prentiss	478	" It does n't matter who told us . "
136165	136180	136120	136121	Miss Prentiss	478	" But he 's going to take all of you down to the basement . "
136181	136212	136120	136121	Miss Prentiss	478	" Well , he has n't begun yet , anyhow . And I suppose you were n't hobnobbing with him in the corridor down on Fourth ten minutes ago either . "
136253	136307	136249	136250	Miss Prentiss	478	" And then Sir Henry Savott . Who was it who was carrying on with him up here on Eighth ? They sent you down to Third to stop it . And he follows you down to Third ! And they have to send you back to Eighth , to stop it again . "
136340	136344	136346	136346	Mac	484	" Miss Prentiss , "
136351	136358	136346	136346	Mac	484	" you ought to be ashamed ! "
136359	136367	136369	136370	Miss Prentiss	478	" Well , I 'm not then , "
136375	136402	136403	136403	She	478	" It 's the talk of the hotel ... And I wish to say again that I shall give in my notice to - morrow morning . "
136414	136420	136426	136426	her	491	" And so shall I , "
136431	136478	136426	136426	her	491	" That 's what we came to tell you . We told you when we came in . And we tell you again . There 's plenty of places waiting for girls like us . So you need n't think , Miss Maclaren ! Good night . "
136479	136483	136485	136486	Miss Prentiss	478	" Good night , "
136749	136764	136765	136765	Mac	484	" What am I to do ? Tell me what I am to do ? "
136769	136796	136765	136765	Mac	484	" Here I 'm appointed head - housekeeper , and the first thing is two of my staff give notice ! What will Mr. Cousin say ? "
136838	136846	136847	136847	she	484	" Where are the tea - things ? "
136850	136855	136847	136847	she	484	" In the bedroom ? "
136865	136871	136856	136856	Mac	484	" I 'll make some . "
136913	136921	136923	136923	she	484	" I 've got that indigestion again , "
136925	136928	136930	136930	Violet	484	" Nerves , "
136933	136952	136953	136953	She	484	" Some tea will put it right . You do n't have to do anything , my dear . "
136966	136995	136953	136953	She	484	" Where 's the tea - canister ? They 're only jealous of you . Mr. Cousin will understand . And I 'm quite sure Mr. Orcham will . "
136996	137057	136953	136953	She	484	" I only told those women about some things they had n't done , this afternoon . I was very careful with them , but I had to tell them off a bit , had n't I ? They 've been against me ever since I was appointed . Dead against me . I 've felt it all the time . "
137058	137067	136953	136953	She	484	" Well of course ! They 're jealous ! "
137068	137084	136953	136953	She	484	" Have they said anything to you about their being jealous , either of them ? "
137085	137089	137090	137090	Violet	484	" Not they ! "
137093	137104	137090	137090	Violet	484	" They knew what they 'd get if they did . "
137105	137125	136953	136953	She	484	" D'ye mean they thought one of them ought to have been given the post , instead of me ? "
137126	137133	137135	137135	Violet	484	" I should n't be surprised , "
137137	137184	137135	137135	Violet	484	" And if one of 'em had got the job , would n't the other one have been jealous all the same ! Would n't she just ! I think Prentiss was the worst . Do you remember what you said to me the other day ? "
137202	137205	136953	136953	She	484	" What ? "
137206	137293	137135	137135	Violet	484	" You said there were too many housekeepers in this hotel . So there are . If you tell Mr. Cousin you think one housekeeper ought to be enough for every two floors , and that anyhow you 'd like to try it , and you do n't want any fresh ones to take the place of that pair - if you tell him that he 'll see the point quick enough . And so will Mr. Orcham . You take it from me , Mac . "
137294	137300	137358	137358	Mac	484	" D'ye really think so ? "
137301	137326	137135	137135	Violet	484	" Of course I do . They know how jealous girls are ! Blast the canister ! Why the hell wo n't it open ? "
137347	137356	137358	137358	Mac	484	" And how nasty they were to you ! "
137387	137419	137384	137385	Miss Prentiss	478	" Such nonsense ! Disgusting , that 's what it is ! Makes you feel perfectly sick ! At least it does me - I do n't know how you feel . "
137420	137430	137432	137432	Violet	484	" Oh ! That 's nothing , all that , "
137438	137453	137432	137432	Violet	484	" But I should like to know what put the idea into their heads . "
137454	137466	137384	137385	Miss Prentiss	478	" They just made it up . I mean Prentiss did . "
137568	137575	137576	137576	she	484	" Of course I shall leave , "
137580	137588	137576	137576	she	484	" What else is there to do ? "
137617	137623	137624	137624	she	484	" Do n't leave me ! "
137634	137677	137624	137624	she	484	" That would be three . And where should I be then ? I never liked anyone as much as I like you . You simply ca n't leave me . I 'll see you through all right . Violet ! Violet ! "
137818	137824	137825	137825	she	484	" Very well , dear , "
137860	137880	137882	137882	Mac	484	" That 's a clever idea of yours about what I ought to say to Mr. Cousin , dear , "
137884	137895	137882	137882	Mac	484	" You 're awfully clever . You are a dear . "
138321	138324	138336	138336	he	296	" Listen ! "
138358	138404	138352	138352	He	296	" Listen ! I quite admit you 're trying to meet me on minor but not unimportant points . I 'll make it L2 10s a share , to be paid in either cash , Orcham shares , or Orcham debentures convertible into Orcham shares . "
138440	138444	138446	138446	he	296	" Orcham Company , "
138472	138480	138481	138482	Father Dennis	414	" No ! Not quite good enough ! "
138490	138496	138498	138498	Evelyn	290	" I 'm afraid not , "
138567	138570	138571	138571	Savott	296	" Aha ! "
138688	138692	138694	138694	Evelyn	290	" Fall to ! "
138696	138700	138702	138703	father Dennis	414	" Fall to ! "
138705	138712	138714	138714	Savott	296	" You are unique , Orcham ! "
138719	138724	138728	138729	father Dennis	414	" He is unique ! "
138731	138740	138742	138742	Evelyn	290	" Open one of those windows - wide , "
138760	138771	138754	138754	he	296	" You can both go . We will help ourselves . "
138779	138782	138785	138785	himself	296	" Aha ! "
138976	138997	138999	139000	father Dennis	414	" If you think I can stand that hurricane in the small of my back , you 've been misinformed , "
139016	139027	139029	139029	Savott	296	" Now let 's see how far we 've got ? "
139055	139058	139059	139059	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
139062	139072	139059	139059	Evelyn	290	" Let 's see how far we 've got . "
139073	139076	139078	139079	father Dennis	414	" Yes , "
139081	139093	139078	139079	father Dennis	414	" let 's look on the bright side for a change . "
139104	139113	139114	139114	Savott	296	" Your salary as Managing Director is settled , "
139118	139124	139126	139126	Evelyn	290	" My salary is settled , "
139128	139140	139142	139142	Savott	296	" I think you have reason to be satisfied with it , "
139146	139149	139151	139151	Evelyn	290	" Quite , "
139168	139220	139221	139221	Evelyn	290	" And the term ? You still insist on a twelve years ' contract ? Ten is more usual , you know . I should prefer ten , as a matter of form . Of course I expect your contract to run for twenty years , thirty . But as a - "
139239	139242	139244	139244	he	290	" Twelve , "
139250	139257	139258	139258	Savott	296	" All right . All right ! "
139341	139355	139356	139356	Savott	296	" And the constitution of the first Orcham Board of Directors is agreed ? "
139359	139363	139365	139366	father Dennis	414	" It is , "
139368	139401	139365	139366	father Dennis	414	" But it 's understood that after serving as Chairman of this fabulous Merger for one year I shall step down and leave the throne to be fought for by rival pretenders . "
139402	139411	139413	139413	Savott	296	" That 's a detail , Mr. Dover , "
139415	139424	139426	139427	father Dennis	414	" It is n't a detail at all , "
139429	139469	139470	139470	He	296	" For me it 's the most important point in the whole damned conspiracy to bleed innocent travellers . Even now , instead of presiding over mergers , I ought to be in bed surrounded by my devoted grandchildren . "
139476	139484	139470	139470	He	296	" Only I have n't any grandchildren . "
139490	139493	139494	139494	Savott	296	" Next , "
139498	139588	139494	139494	Savott	296	" I agree that my valuations of the Majestic and the Duncannon and the continental hotels are to be approved by your valuers . Orcham agrees to make a tour at once of all the hotels , and the entire arrangement is to be subject to his being satisfied . I 've shown you my scheme for raising capital and underwriting it , and I agree to produce to you as soon as possible my contracts for this purpose with the three City houses I 've told you of . "
139611	139618	139619	139619	Savott	296	" I fancy that 's all , "
139697	139703	139705	139706	father Dennis	414	" It is n't all , "
139708	139716	139718	139718	Savott	296	" No . It is n't all , "
139720	139749	139718	139718	Savott	296	" Naturally . Let 's come back to the price of Imperial Palace shares . I 've quoted you L2 10s . Now seriously , what about it ? "
139769	139787	139789	139790	Henry Savott	296	" You really must n't make it too difficult for the Orcham Company to pay a dividend , "
139792	139801	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" We have to think of our shareholders , "
139806	139826	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" And we have n't got to think of anything else . If you consider our price too high - "
139827	139831	139833	139833	Savott	296	" I do , "
139835	139858	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" Then it 's for you to say so plainly and definitely , and the scheme 's on the scrap - heap . "
139859	139872	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" But your own valuations of your own property do n't justify - "
139873	139889	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" Valuations ! Valuations ! And our reserves , in cash and gilt - edged ? "
139890	139897	139803	139804	father Dennis	414	" I 'm not forgetting them . "
139898	139915	139916	139917	father Dennis	414	" But you 're forgetting that we 're selling you something that ca n't be valued , "
139921	139991	139916	139917	father Dennis	414	" If you were n't forgetting that you surely would n't talk about valuations . We 're selling you the very sine qua non of your scheme . What is the scheme without the Imperial Palace and Orcham ? You 'd never have thought of it without them . What the Merger must have is our prestige . Take that away and it 's worth exactly elevenpence three farthings . "
139992	139997	139999	139999	Savott	296	" I quite agree , "
140005	140107	139999	139999	Savott	296	" And was n't I the first to say so ? But I should like you to remember this . If I 'd got hold of a majority or anywhere near a majority of Palace shares , as I meant to do , only you scotched me by altering the voting power of your shares while my head was turned the other way - what would have happened ? I should have been able to name my own price for your shares , and what I 'd lost on the shares I should have made on the Merger , and more . "
140108	140111	140112	140113	father Dennis	414	" Certainly , "
140117	140210	140112	140113	father Dennis	414	" There 's no argument about that . But we did alter the voting power , thereby putting you gently into the soup , my friend . If this and if that , you would have been able to name your own price . But as there do n't happen to be any ifs , we can name our price . And it 's a price the Merger can well afford to pay . It is n't as if we had n't come down a bit . Our price is L2 15s . "
140211	140217	140262	140262	Evelyn	290	" That 's your lowest ? "
140218	140222	140112	140113	father Dennis	414	" Our lowest . "
140223	140237	140239	140240	Sir Henry	296	" Well , I 'm sorry . My last word is L2 10s . "
140333	140338	140339	140340	Sir Henry	296	" I 'm sorry , "
140344	140513	140339	140340	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , I 'm very sorry . I 'm more disappointed than I can say . I must apologise to you for putting you to so much trouble for nothing . I do n't complain , mind you . Not in the least . You know your own business best . Only I 've got a sort of a notion of my business too . We differ , and there 's no more to be said . But you 'll find yourselves wrong about one thing . I shall go on with my Merger . Nothing is indispensable , not even the Imperial Palace . I 've set my heart on a merger . I 've never set my heart on anything and failed to get it . I 'll carry the Merger through , and I 'll give you the fight of your life , whatever it costs me . There must be another Orcham lying about somewhere in the world . I 'll find him . "
140514	140517	140518	140518	Evelyn	290	" Bravo ! "
140757	140760	140736	140737	Sir Henry	296	" Good afternoon "
140822	140827	140828	140828	he	296	" Split the difference , "
140887	140893	140895	140896	the demon	4735	" It 's a deal , "
140902	140908	140909	140910	father Dennis	414	" Oh , very well ! "
141025	141030	141018	141019	father Dennis	414	" Damn it all ! "
141071	141076	141056	141056	Evelyn	290	" Damn it all ! "
141446	141462	141464	141465	father Dennis	414	" My car 's been waiting two hours , and even chauffeurs have to eat , "
141467	141490	141464	141465	father Dennis	414	" Good - bye . Seems to me I look like being the biggest shareholder even in your new Company , Savott . "
141508	141513	141515	141516	Sir Henry	296	" By the way , "
141533	141541	141515	141516	Sir Henry	296	" That Powler girl declined my offer . "
141542	141546	141547	141547	Evelyn	290	" Oh yes ! "
141550	141555	141547	141547	Evelyn	290	" So I heard . "
141556	141563	141515	141516	Sir Henry	296	" Did she tell you then ? "
141564	141600	141601	141601	He	414	" No . But she told my head - housekeeper she should stay here , and the thing got about . Things do , you know . This place is a regular whispering - gallery . "
141623	141638	141606	141606	he	414	" I 've never set my heart on anything and failed to get it . "
141913	141936	141906	141906	he	290	" Am I equal to the job ? I wonder . Everybody believes in me . But do I believe in myself ? "
141959	142007	141956	141956	he	290	" That fellow Savott 's been a bit obscure about his underwriting after all . I suppose it 'll be all right . I bet anything Harry Matcham Lord Watlington 's really at the back of it . Those City houses do n't often stand by themselves . "
142012	142061	142009	142009	he	290	" Why did the fellow choose that moment to tell me he 'd missed fire with the Powler woman ? I expect it was just a subconscious nervous reaction from the strain . He 's been working hard , the fellow has , these days . So have I. "
142138	142140	142125	142125	Violet	484	" Orcham "
142203	142209	142210	142210	he	290	" Anything urgent for me ? "
142213	142223	142246	142246	she	4767	" No , sir . There 's only the - "
142224	142229	142246	142246	she	4767	" Is it urgent ? "
142230	142235	142246	142246	she	4767	" No , sir . "
142236	142244	142246	142246	she	4767	" Then we 'll let it simmer . "
142385	142395	142380	142381	a waiter	1959	" May I take away the things , sir ? "
142396	142400	142380	142381	a waiter	1959	" You may . "
142453	142458	142459	142459	he	290	" Well , Ceria , "
142465	142491	142459	142459	he	290	" What are you doing here at this hour ? I always understood you spent the afternoon in the bosom of your family at Hampstead . "
142649	142652	142642	142645	The film - kings	4786	" Seeria . "
142660	142663	142653	142657	The more learned and cosmopolitan	4793	" Cheeria , "
142674	142677	142673	142673	him	511	" Cheerio . "
142722	142730	142717	142717	Ceria	511	" My Feras have arrived , sir . "
142731	142735	142717	142717	Ceria	511	" Your what ? "
142736	142760	142717	142717	Ceria	511	" The fish from the Lake of Geneva . By aeroplane . Caught this morning . On my dinner menu to - night . "
142769	142775	142717	142717	Ceria	511	" Have you told Immerson ? "
142776	142782	142717	142717	Ceria	511	" Oh yes , sir . "
142796	142801	142803	142803	Evelyn	290	" I congratulate you , "
142805	142812	142803	142803	Evelyn	290	" It 's a great stunt . "
142813	142826	142827	142827	Ceria	511	" Mr. Immerson calls them my ' flying fish , ' sir . "
143328	143358	143325	143325	Evelyn	290	" Supposing in a year or two 's time the fellow starts hankypankying with the ' Orcham ' shares , in the vein of his performance with North Atlantic ! "
143374	143376	143361	143361	he	290	" decently "
143508	143517	143518	143518	he	290	" Sir Henry in any difficulty , Mowlem ? "
143521	143553	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" No , sir . Mr. Adolphe did n't happen to be at the Reception , so Sir Henry came to me . He 's leaving us later in the afternoon . "
143566	143575	143576	143576	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! Where is he going to ? "
143584	143601	143582	143582	himself	290	" What 's the meaning of this ? He did n't tell me anything about leaving . "
143602	143622	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" Sir Henry did n't say , sir . Only told me to have his luggage down at five . '
143623	143642	143582	143582	himself	290	" Well , Mowlem , I shall be leaving myself for a while in a day or two . "
143643	143649	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" For long , sir ? "
143650	143660	143582	143582	himself	290	" No , not for long . It depends . "
143661	143666	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" Continent , sir ? "
143667	143670	143582	143582	himself	290	" Yes . "
143671	143695	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" When you come back , sir , I should like a chat with you , if you can spare me a moment . "
143696	143699	143582	143582	himself	290	" Oh ? "
143700	143725	143554	143554	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir . Of course you know I always said I should retire at sixty . And I 'm sixty next month . "
143726	143733	143734	143734	Evelyn	290	" Now , Mowlem , Mowlem ! "
143745	143769	143741	143741	he	290	" You may have said you were going to retire . But I never said you were . What does Mr. Cousin say ? "
143770	143789	143790	143790	Evelyn	290	" To tell you the truth , sir , I have n't mentioned the matter to Mr. Cousin . "
143853	143869	143871	143871	Evelyn	290	" Mr. Cousin wo n't let you go . He thinks too highly of you , "
143874	143879	143880	143880	Mowlem	312	" Well , sir , "
143885	143897	143898	143898	He	312	" we shall see . Sixty is sixty . Times change . "
143931	143935	143937	143937	Evelyn	290	" Mowlem knows , "
143977	143984	143961	143961	he	312	" Well , Cousin . C'est fait "
144320	144333	144334	144334	Perosi	516	" Qu'est - ce qu'elle a ? Qu'est - ce qu'elle a ? "
144337	144344	144345	144345	Ceria	511	" Elle a eu une attaque , "
144364	144373	144375	144375	Violet	516	" She must be carried to her bedroom , "
144478	144487	144488	144488	Violet	516	" Keep her head lower , Mr. Ceria , "
144491	144499	144501	144501	Ted	391	" Take the lift down , kid , "
144595	144603	144605	144605	Violet	484	" I 'll telephone for Dr. Constam , "
144607	144625	144605	144605	Violet	484	" Where does he live ? I suppose he does n't happen to be in the hotel ? "
144626	144632	144633	144633	Ceria	511	" The doctor is coming , "
144645	144668	144633	144633	Ceria	511	" I said to them to telephone for him before I came up . He is in the hotel . Santa Maria ! "
144674	144686	144687	144687	He	1180	" I had forgotten nothing . This is Imperial Palace staffwork . "
144691	144705	144687	144687	He	1180	" I think it was the doctor who was ringing for the lift . "
144725	144729	144730	144730	he	756	" In here ? "
144745	144750	144740	144740	He	756	" Right , Ceria . "
144785	144794	144795	144795	Violet	484	" Shall I sponge her face for her ? "
144798	144805	144777	144777	He	11430	" No . Wait a minute . "
145043	145056	145058	145059	Dr. Constam	438	" Get me some water , only a sip , will you ? "
145074	145080	145065	145065	He	290	" Where 's the telephone ? "
145081	145097	145065	145065	He	290	" In the sitting - room . Can I ' phone for you , doctor ? "
145098	145101	145102	145103	The doctor	11430	" No . "
145157	145163	145166	145166	him	11430	" It 's extremely urgent , "
145169	145194	145166	145166	him	11430	" You 'd better send an ambulance . No . The motor - ambulance . Yes , at once . I 'll be ready . "
145207	145240	145195	145195	He	11430	" There 's a nurse in 538 . She ca n't be very busy . Go and fetch her - yourself . Tell her I sent you . And bring her along . "
145241	145251	145252	145252	she	484	" Yes , doctor . Is this something serious ? "
145258	145285	145286	145286	He	11430	" It 's serious . But exactly what it is I 'm not sure yet . Colon anyhow . Run . And then get a stretcher . "
145304	145308	145309	145309	she	484	" Mr. Perosi , "
145314	145321	145309	145309	she	484	" The doctor wants a stretcher . "
145368	145374	145376	145377	Dr. Constam	438	" Come on , nurse , "
145386	145405	145406	145406	he	11430	" We 've got to get this young woman here downstairs . An ambulance is coming . You , "
145410	145429	145430	145430	he	11430	" go and ring for the lift . And keep it . Do n't bring the stretcher in , "
145434	145448	145430	145430	he	11430	" We should never get it out again with the patient in it . "
146468	146479	146480	146480	he	334	" I am glad you are here , Miss Powler , "
146483	146490	146480	146480	he	334	" I wanted to see you . "
146491	146496	146497	146497	He	334	" Yes , sir . "
146552	146557	146559	146559	he	334	" Please sit down , "
146564	146579	146561	146561	Violet	484	" It is very sad , this . I hear that you were present . "
146580	146592	146606	146606	he	334	" When Miss Maclaren was brought up ? Yes , sir . "
146593	146599	146561	146561	Violet	484	" Tell me about it . "
146611	146620	146606	146606	he	334	" Everything is in order on the Floors ? "
146621	146630	146631	146631	Violet	484	" So far as I know , sir , "
146634	146647	146631	146631	Violet	484	" But of course I do n't know about all the Floors . "
146648	146707	146708	146708	Violet	484	" For the future , at least until Miss Maclaren has recovered , it will be your business to know everything about all the Floors . I must have someone in control , someone who is responsible . And you will be good enough to take Miss Maclaren 's place for the present . Provisional , of course . "
146743	146747	146748	146748	she	484	" But surely , "
146753	146778	146748	146748	she	484	" Miss Venables or Miss Prentiss . They ... I ... All of them have been here longer than I have , much longer . "
146779	146784	146786	146787	Mr. Cousin	334	" That is possible , "
146791	146825	146786	146787	Mr. Cousin	334	" But Miss Venables and Miss Prentiss are leaving . And having regard to their conduct , I do not wish to add to their responsibilities . As for the others ... No . "
146834	146843	146826	146826	He	334	" It is you alone who are indicated . "
146870	146879	146881	146881	Violet	484	" Very well . Thank you , sir , "
146898	146900	146896	146896	you	4955	" No "
146910	146913	146908	146908	you	4955	" Very well "
146915	146919	146908	146908	you	4955	" Thank you , "
146940	146961	146962	146962	He	334	" In case you need help or advice , come to me . Naturally you will have difficulties , but - "
146968	146991	146964	146964	his	334	" But about allotting the Floors , sir ? I expect that Miss Maclaren has spoken to you about her new plan - "
146992	147000	147001	147002	Mr. Cousin	334	" That will be as you decide , "
147030	147040	147026	147026	They	4956	" What hospital is Miss Maclaren in , sir ? "
147041	147046	147048	147049	Mr. Cousin	334	" St. James 's , "
147051	147091	147048	147049	Mr. Cousin	334	" You see , we have endowed more than one bed there with the surplus from our Breakages Fund . They were very crowded , but of course they wished to oblige us . Good night , Miss Powler . "
147107	147153	147102	147102	he	334	" It may interest you to know that Mr. Orcham has just been telephoning to me from Cannes . So I told him about Miss Maclaren , and that I had decided to put you in temporary charge . He approved . Good night again . "
147299	147313	147295	147295	They	4964	" Of course ! Quite natural . Just what was to be expected ! "
147620	147625	147627	147627	Venables	491	" I did knock , "
147639	147648	147627	147627	Venables	491	" but nobody answered . Mac 's gone ? "
147652	147665	147666	147666	She	484	" As if she did n't know perfectly well Mac 's gone ! "
147669	147678	147666	147666	She	484	" Oh ! An hour ago at least . "
147679	147705	147649	147649	Violet	484	" I thought I 'd better come up and see . I did n't really know what had happened . I suppose it 's appendicitis ? "
147706	147711	147666	147666	She	484	" Ca n't say . "
147712	147718	147649	147649	Violet	484	" But it must be . "
147719	147743	147666	147666	She	484	" Perhaps it is . Only Dr. Constam told me he did n't know . He 's gone with her to the hospital . "
147744	147752	147649	147649	Violet	484	" You were here all the time ? "
147753	147756	147666	147666	She	484	" Yes . "
147795	147811	147649	147649	Violet	484	" Gwen and I have been wondering how this place is to be carried on . "
147815	147830	147831	147831	She	484	" Yes ; and that 's what you 've come up to find out . "
147834	147862	147831	147831	She	484	" I think you had better take over Sixth and Fifth . I 'll see to this floor and Seventh . I 'll speak to Prentiss tomorrow . "
147863	147868	147869	147869	Venables	491	" Oh , indeed ! "
147880	147883	147946	147946	Venables	491	" Yes . "
147884	147892	147946	147946	Venables	491	" But who 'll be in charge ? "
147893	147902	147946	147946	Venables	491	" Mr. Cousin says I am to be . "
147903	147914	147920	147920	Venables	491	" So you 've been down to see him already ? "
147924	147941	147946	147946	Venables	491	" No , I have n't . He came up here to see me about it . "
147958	147967	147946	147946	Venables	491	" May I use the telephone , please ? "
147968	147980	147981	147981	Violet	484	" Of course . Why do you ask such a question ? "
148000	148032	148033	148033	Her	491	" I want you to get up then , dear . Slip something on . I want you to come here at once , as quick as you can , dear . "
148116	148126	148129	148129	Venables	491	" I thought you were never coming , dear ! "
148145	148147	148140	148140	Venables	491	" dear "
148214	148219	148225	148225	Violet	484	" Do sit down , "
148233	148238	148240	148240	Venables	491	" Now , Powler , "
148242	148254	148240	148240	Venables	491	" will you please tell Prentiss what you 've told me . "
148260	148275	148240	148240	Venables	491	" I want you to hear from her what she told me , dear . "
148276	148281	148310	148310	her	4985	" About Mr. Cousin ? "
148282	148289	148240	148240	Venables	491	" If you do n't mind . "
148293	148296	148310	148310	her	4985	" Well ! "
148313	148320	148321	148321	Violet	484	" I ca n't help it , "
148325	148347	148321	148321	Violet	484	" Mr. Cousin came up himself and gave me my orders . I do n't give orders . I take them . "
148348	148357	148358	148358	Venables	491	" You soon started giving orders to me ! "
148379	148389	148390	148390	Violet	484	" But I did n't give you any order , "
148401	148432	148390	148390	Violet	484	" I only said I thought you 'd better take over Fifth and Sixth . If you 've anything against that , let me hear it for goodness ' sake ! "
148433	148443	148444	148444	Venables	491	" Is it an order or is n't it ? "
148461	148469	148444	148444	Venables	491	" Have you got any other suggestion ? "
148470	148480	148481	148481	Venables	491	" Is it an order or is n't it ? "
148487	148496	148498	148498	Violet	484	" I do n't call it an order , "
148500	148521	148498	148498	Violet	484	" But of course if you prefer to call it an order I ca n't stop you , can I ? "
148522	148525	148526	148526	Prentiss	478	" Well ! "
148529	148551	148526	148526	Prentiss	478	" Venables has been here six years and I 've been here seven , and have you been here seven weeks ? "
149194	149208	149209	149209	she	484	" I wo n't speak . I wo n't give them a chance , "
149214	149228	149229	149229	Prentiss	478	" I should like to know what Mr. Orcham would say to this , "
149247	149300	149243	149244	Suddenly Prentiss	478	" Then it is n't Mr. Cousin ! It is n't Mr. Cousin after all . Mr. Orcham brought you here and you 're his pet . Yes , he brings you here and he pushes you up all the time . And why ? Why , I should like to know . "
149319	149325	149326	149326	Violet	484	" I sha n't speak , "
149383	149389	149390	149390	Violet	484	" I sha n't speak , "
149408	149422	149424	149424	Prentiss	478	" I do n't know what you mean to do , my dear , "
149429	149441	149424	149424	Prentiss	478	" But tomorrow morning I shall walk out of this place . "
149442	149449	149450	149450	Venables	491	" So shall I , dear , "
149468	149471	149473	149473	Violet	484	" Well , "
149477	149486	149473	149473	Violet	484	" You can settle that with Mr. Cousin . "
149558	149572	149545	149545	She	484	" I did n't speak . I did n't give them a chance . "
149607	149615	149617	149621	the boyish - faced Ceria	5023	" Who is he , that one ? "
149808	149820	149822	149825	the head - waiter	10091	" That one ? He ought to be Sir Henry Savott , "
150535	150552	150554	150559	the chairman of the film company	5105	" If you do n't know Sir Henry Savott , Ceria , you soon will do , "
150589	150597	150599	150600	Sir Henry	296	" Glad to know you , Ceria , "
150608	150632	150566	150566	He	5105	" I 've never had the pleasure of seeing you here before , Sir Henry . But I know you well by sight . "
150641	150658	150566	150566	He	5105	" I hope you like your new house . One hears that it is very wonderful . "
150668	150675	150676	150676	He	296	" This fellow knows his job . "
150697	150722	150694	150694	he	296	" How are the New Year 's Eve arrangements getting on ? We shall be in next year before we know where we are . "
150733	150792	150723	150723	Ceria	511	" I believe that nearly every table in the restaurant has been booked already . Mr. Cousin told me yesterday that before Christmas comes he will be refusing very many applications . Mr. Cappone said several hundreds . It will be a record New Year 's Eve for the Imperial Palace . Last year was a record too . "
150793	150822	150824	150825	Sir Henry	296	" That 's fine . I have n't reserved a table yet , but I shall do . You might tell Cappone , if you do n't mind , "
150835	150840	150842	150842	Ceria	511	" Certainly , sir , "
150857	150872	150842	150842	Ceria	511	" This will help you to understand that there is only one Imperial Palace . "
150873	150885	150886	150887	Sir Henry	296	" But surely you are n't going to turn people away , "
150898	150964	150886	150887	Sir Henry	296	" What are we to do , sir ? There was some suggestion of using the ball - room as another restaurant , and clearing the tables at half - past twelve ; but of course it could not be done . People will want to eat and drink till two o'clock at least , and people will want to begin to dance at midnight . "
150965	150972	150974	150975	Sir Henry	296	" But there is this room , "
150977	150995	150974	150975	Sir Henry	296	" Tables here for three hundred and more . But perhaps this room is to be used . "
150996	151000	151001	151003	the Scottish chairman	5110	" Good idea ! "
151006	151029	151001	151003	the Scottish chairman	5110	" Have a separate function here , and I 'll give you the first showing of my new forty - minute film . "
151070	151107	151056	151056	he	511	" We must keep this room for those who do not like New Year 's Eve dinners and suppers . And then , our visitors who are staying in the hotel ! Impossible ! Quite impossible ! "
151108	151113	151114	151115	Sir Henry	296	" Yes , yes , "
151132	151136	151138	151141	the owner of cinemas	5113	" My maxim , "
151143	151184	151138	151141	the owner of cinemas	5113	" is the greatest pleasure for the greatest number . You could fill this room with a special festivity . Could you fill it with your old fogeys , and if you could , would they spend as much money ? "
151185	151208	151209	151209	he	5113	" No , sir , I hardly expect to fill it , and they would not spend half as much . You , "
151219	151230	151209	151209	he	5113	" you would perhaps speak to Mr. Cousin , sir . "
151281	151325	151241	151241	Ceria	511	" He would have given a very great deal to be the autocrat of a New Year festivity of his own , complete with orchestra , cinema , balloons , streamers , missiles , caps , toy - instruments , incandescent puddings and all .
152135	152139	152140	152140	Violet	353	" Come in , "
152209	152220	152206	152206	He	511	" Bon jour , mademoiselle , comment allez - vous ? "
152260	152275	152238	152238	Violet	353	" Trés bien , monsieur , je vous remercie . Et vous - meme ? "
152648	152696	152643	152643	He	480	" I have represented myself to this most sympathetic young woman as a man full of general kindliness . I must on no account destroy the character which I have created for myself in her eyes . More than anything I wish to stand well with her . "
152738	152750	152751	152751	Ceria	511	" I came to enquire the latest news about Miss Maclaren , "
152755	152760	152762	152762	Violet	353	" Do sit down , "
152764	152832	152762	152762	Violet	353	" I called yesterday at the hospital to leave some flowers , but I was not allowed to see her . But Dr. Constam telephoned me this morning that if they could do without a second operation she would very likely pull through . If they must have another operation he would n't prophesy . Anyhow , the poor thing is holding her own for the present . "
152833	152843	152844	152844	Ceria	511	" Did he tell you exactly what it is ? "
152847	152860	152861	152861	Violet	353	" He did n't . They hardly ever do , you know . "
152865	152899	152861	152861	Violet	353	" I think she will pull through . People generally pull through , do n't they ? Do sit down , Mr. Ceria . Wo n't you sit down again , Mr. Perosi ? "
152911	152918	152920	152920	Ceria	511	" But you are going out , "
152925	152931	152932	152932	Perosi	480	" Not the slightest hurry . "
152938	152946	152948	152948	he	480	" I must go down to Fourth , "
152950	152954	152948	152948	he	480	" Thank you . "
152969	152996	152961	152961	he	480	" You were the first to see Miss Maclaren . Comment ça est - il arrivé ? Personne n'en satl rien - a ce qu'il parait . "
153011	153089	153008	153008	his	511	" She telephoned that she wanted to see me . I asked her to come down to my office . She had the attack as she came in . Very severe pain , I should say . I helped her to sit on a chair . She would have fallen off if I had not held her . Then I carried her to the lift . That was all . I know no more than anybody else . "
153090	153096	153169	153169	He	2687	" She did n't speak ? "
153097	153102	153008	153008	his	511	" She could not . "
153103	153115	153116	153116	Perosi	480	" She did not say why she came to see you ? "
153126	153137	153120	153120	Ceria	511	" Nothing . I can not guess what she wanted . "
153182	153255	153169	153169	He	2687	" Ceria , my friend , I hear you are thinking of organising a New Year 's Eve celebration in the grill - room to accommodate visitors who have not succeeded in obtaining tables in the restaurant . It is a fine idea , that ! At New Year 's Eve there is little to do on the Floors . If I can help you in the service , dispose of me . "
153533	153541	153542	153542	he	511	" Have you heard of it then ? "
153546	153550	153552	153552	Perosi	480	" I heard , "
153554	153557	153558	153558	Perosi	480	" How ? "
153563	153570	153571	153571	he	480	" I seem to have heard , "
153730	153743	153744	153744	he	511	" It will be discussed at the conference to - morrow morning , "
154503	154509	154511	154511	Ceria	511	" You are going out , "
154529	154533	154534	154534	she	484	" Not yet , "
154537	154550	154534	154534	she	484	" Are you generally here on Sunday afternoons ? I thought that - "
154551	154618	154511	154511	Ceria	511	" I am never here on Sunday afternoons , and not often on Sunday evenings . But my mother and my sisters went away this morning to the Riviera . They would have gone to Italy , our home , but there might have been complications for the return . They are not naturalised British subjects like I am . My eldest sister has been unwell . "
154619	154627	154534	154534	she	484	" I 'm sorry to hear that . "
154628	154678	154679	154679	He	5222	" Not ill . Unwell . It is the damp climate . They have gone for a month . My house is empty . You understand - the sadness of an empty home . I could not tolerate it alone . After lunch I stayed here . Laisser aller ! "
154691	154702	154703	154703	Violet	484	" What a pity you did not call earlier then ! "
154706	154715	154703	154703	Violet	484	" I might have given you some tea . "
154892	154899	154900	154900	she	484	" Do you live near here ? "
154903	154916	154900	154900	she	484	" I suppose you do , because of getting home at nights . "
155127	155145	155124	155124	Ceria	511	" I must go . May I telephone you for news of Miss Maclaren to - morrow ? "
155149	155163	155164	155164	she	484	" I do hope your New Year 's Eve dinner will be arranged , "
155179	155183	155184	155184	he	511	" Ah yes ! "
155194	155238	155184	155184	he	511	" I was so glad that Perosi favoured it . Perosi is listened to here in the Palace . He is a historical monument . If when he sees Mr. Cousin he should chance to say a word - it would have influence . "
155239	155242	155291	155291	She	484	" Really ? "
155243	155253	155184	155184	he	511	" Yes , yes . I have noticed before . "
155254	155267	155268	155268	Violet	484	" I shall tell him he must . I shall tell him . "
155304	155317	155291	155291	She	484	" I shall tell him to - night when I come back . "
155318	155324	155325	155325	Ceria	511	" How nice of you ! "
155747	155763	155764	155764	she	484	" I must positively be back at the old Pally by ten o'clock , children , "
155778	155780	155733	155733	his	799	" Pally "
155857	155864	155845	155845	his	799	" Well , that 's done ! "
156560	156570	156571	156571	she	484	" I 'm so glad I 've caught you , "
156625	156639	156622	156622	She	484	" Why ca n't I do it ? Why am I so stiff ? "
156729	156736	156720	156720	she	484	" I shall tell him he must "
156825	156839	156841	156843	the French master	5352	" Qu'est - ce que c'est ? Vous me le direz en français , "
156898	156928	156929	156929	Perosi	480	" You remember what you said to Mr. Ceria this afternoon in my room about that scheme for a New Year 's Eve dinner in the grill - room ? "
156933	157033	156929	156929	Perosi	480	" Well , after you left he talked about it . He seems frightfully keen on it , but he 's afraid they 'll turn it down . Now I was just thinking - everybody in this place knows what influence you have here , and I was just thinking that if you did get a chance to put in a word to Mr. Cousin , perhaps you might ... You see what I mean . It 's only an idea that crossed my mind . And everybody does know your influence . I 've often heard of it . "
157084	157094	157081	157081	She	5355	" After all I 'm doing this fairly well . "
157205	157208	157209	157209	he	480	" No ! "
157218	157227	157209	157209	he	480	" I shall not speak to Mr. Cousin . "
157228	157231	157232	157232	Violet	484	" Oh ! "
157255	157258	157259	157259	Perosi	480	" But , "
157268	157276	157259	157259	Perosi	480	" I shall speak to Mr. Orcham . "
157277	157283	157259	157259	Perosi	480	" Mr. Orcham ! But - "
157284	157427	157259	157259	Perosi	480	" Mr. Orcham has telegraphed from Boulogne that he will be here to - night . Victoria 10.47 . I 've only heard this minute . If they 'd let me know early , I should not have changed my clothes . Now I must change back again , because when Mr. Orcham returns after an absence I take his orders myself . So I shall not go to the Majestic . I take just a little walk to the river and back , to breathe . That is why I go out earlier than I said . I shall see Mr. Orcham in his room , and if I can I shall say a word . He likes me to take his orders myself - I mean for a meal , if he is hungry . I shall certainly see him . "
157428	157433	157435	157435	Violet	484	" That 's splendid ! "
157437	157446	157435	157435	Violet	484	" And it 's very nice of you . "
158267	158272	158275	158275	he	480	" Yes , yes , "
158316	158325	158326	158326	Evelyn	290	" I 'm a bit tired , Perosi , "
158330	158337	158326	158326	Evelyn	290	" Good night . Thank you . "
158710	158716	158717	158717	he	329	" I suppose , sir , "
158731	158745	158717	158717	he	329	" I suppose you would n't care for me to withdraw my notice ? "
158797	158855	158793	158793	he	329	" Inconstant ass ! Coward ! He 's afraid . And he does n't know his own mind . Why the devil should I let him withdraw his notice ? Fancies himself as a retail tobacconist , and then funks it ! But I might have guessed he 'd give in when it came to the point ! "
158871	158889	158890	158890	He	329	" We 'll talk about that to - morrow . I shall have to think it over . "
158895	158910	158890	158890	He	329	" Be as quick as you can . I want to go to bed . "
158911	158916	158866	158866	he	329	" Yes , sir . "
159055	159058	159046	159046	He	290	" Oldham ! "
159059	159064	159067	159068	the man	1015	" Yes , sir . "
159076	159084	159085	159085	Evelyn	290	" Who has put these letters here ? "
159112	159121	159123	159123	Oldham	329	" I really could n't say , sir , "
159138	159162	159163	159163	Evelyn	290	" They have been put here since I went into the bedroom to speak to you . Someone must have brought them here . "
159177	159182	159167	159167	he	290	" Yes , sir . "
159183	159192	159123	159123	Oldham	329	" You do n't know who did it ? "
159193	159198	159167	159167	he	290	" No , sir . "
159199	159210	159123	159123	Oldham	329	" Well go , and find out - at once . "
159211	159217	159219	159219	Oldham	329	" Very good , sir , "
159225	159252	159219	159219	Oldham	329	" He 's just told me to hurry up with the unpacking and here he pushes me off to do something else ! What a life ! "
159332	159417	159324	159324	He	290	" My dear Orcham . This is to tell you that my friend Mr. Oliver Oxford , managing director of the Carlyle Oxford British Films Company , has an idea to suggest to you for the proposed New Year 's Eve affair in your grill - room . Please listen to him . I think it was I who first thought of a special affair in the grill - room for New Year 's Eve . Oxford is a friend of mine . Yours . "
159504	159509	159539	159539	He	290	" Carlyle Oxford British . "
159956	159968	159949	159949	Evelyn	290	" Find out if a Mr. Oliver Oxford is staying here . "
159969	159975	159982	159982	Oldham	329	" Very good , sir . "
160304	160308	160301	160301	her	353	" Mr. Orcham ? "
160309	160355	160301	160301	her	353	" Speaking . I 've just returned , Miss Powler . I did n't want to trouble you at this time of the night , but I was rather anxious to have the latest news about Miss Maclaren . How is she to - day ? "
160356	160365	160301	160301	her	353	" Not out of danger yet , sir . "
160366	160378	160379	160379	He	329	" Oh ! Sorry to hear that ! I was hoping - "
160382	160392	160301	160301	her	353	" It 's rather a long story , sir . "
160393	160397	160399	160399	Evelyn	290	" I say , "
160406	160432	160399	160399	Evelyn	290	" I wonder if you 'd mind very much coming down now and telling me . I 'm in my room - not my office . "
160433	160438	160466	160466	her	5457	" Certainly , sir . "
160701	160719	160720	160720	she	353	" Excuse my dress , please . I 've just been home to see mother and father , "
160727	160735	160736	160736	he	329	" It 's a very nice dress , "
160745	160771	160736	160736	he	329	" Do sit down . It 's you who must excuse me , sending for you like this . Now tell me the whole story . "
160953	160956	160958	160958	Evelyn	290	" Um ! "
161091	161099	161059	161059	She	353	" Wo n't you have a cigarette ? "
161100	161104	161106	161106	Violet	353	" Thank you , "
161134	161156	161157	161157	he	329	" What 's your idea about this scheme for a special New Year 's Eve dinner in the grill - room ? "
161199	161243	161189	161189	He	329	" Supposing anyone came in and saw her and me smoking together , and her in that frock , and the time after midnight , especially as I sneaked into the hotel . Of course no one will come in , but supposing - "
161249	161256	161257	161257	he	329	" You 've heard of it ? "
161260	161269	161270	161270	She	353	" Yes , I have heard of it . "
161282	161287	161288	161288	he	329	" Who told you ? "
161331	161341	161342	161342	Violet	353	" I do n't know anything about those things , "
161367	161371	161362	161363	Mr. Orcham	290	" This scheme ! "
161402	161427	161428	161428	She	353	" I 'm quite a beginner here . I do n't know half enough about the Floors yet , and as for anything else - "
161448	161497	161445	161445	she	353	" I expect they 're waiting for you to settle it . I 'm sure everybody 's glad you 've come back . We 've all been rather lost without you . Mr. Cousin was saying only the day before yesterday he hoped you 'd be back soon . "
161498	161508	161445	161445	she	353	" You 've been seeing Mr. Cousin pretty often ? "
161509	161544	161445	161445	she	353	" Not seeing him . On the telephone . I 've had to ask him about dozens of things . He 's been very kind to me . No one could have been nicer . "
161545	161548	161550	161550	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
161552	161570	161550	161550	Evelyn	290	" Mr. Cousin 's the man you have to deal with , not me , you know . "
161571	161578	161445	161445	she	353	" Yes , I do know . "
161781	161789	161790	161790	he	290	" Heard anything about your old home ? "
161793	161805	161806	161806	She	353	" My old home ? Oh ! You mean the Laundry ? "
161810	161844	161806	161806	She	353	" No . Except that Miss Brury is getting on splendidly . Mr. Purkin came up to see Mr. Cousin , and I happened to meet him . He told me so himself . "
161845	161867	161873	161873	his	290	" Excellent ! Excellent ! I had an idea she would . That change we made is working out very well . "
161884	161895	161873	161873	his	290	" I 'm so glad you think so , sir . "
161946	161954	161937	161937	he	290	" How is the French getting on ? "
161955	161959	161960	161960	she	353	" Very slowly , "
161963	161973	161960	161960	she	353	" But Mr. Perosi is a very good teacher . "
161974	161995	161937	161937	he	290	" And does the very good teacher think that progress is slow , or is that only your own idea ? "
161996	162017	161960	161960	she	353	" He says it 's pretty quick , considering . But to me it does seem terribly slow . Really ! "
162018	162026	162027	162027	Evelyn	290	" I know the trouble I had , "
162031	162080	162027	162027	Evelyn	290	" And even now , when I 'm said to be mighty fluent , I often think I 've done no more than scratch the surface of the infernal language . If you ask me , French is the most difficult language in the world - except English . "
162287	162346	162381	162381	she	353	" with a French staff , etc . Nonsense ! And anyhow , she would shake down with the clientele , which was ninety - five per cent . British and American . To the clientele she would be balm , a rock of refuge , an oasis , an all - comprehending angel , everything that was sympathetic .
162391	162394	162395	162395	be	290	" Well , "
162398	162409	162395	162395	be	290	" It 's late . I must n't keep you . "
162410	162413	162414	162414	she	353	" Well , "
162429	162436	162414	162414	she	353	" Our hours are very long . "
162442	162449	162450	162450	he	290	" Stomach that , my boy ! "
162478	162485	162473	162473	He	290	" I admire her for that . "
162486	162492	162493	162493	she	353	" Thank you so much , "
162508	162519	162520	162520	she	353	" You 're very kind and I do appreciate it , "
162686	162693	162695	162695	Oldham	329	" I beg pardon , sir , "
162709	162714	162715	162715	Evelyn	290	" Just in time , "
162813	162823	162824	162824	he	290	" What is it , Oldham ? Come in , "
162828	162845	162824	162824	he	290	" I 've finished all the unpacking , sir . Is there anything else , sir ? "
162846	162851	162853	162853	Evelyn	290	" No , thanks , "
162855	162867	162853	162853	Evelyn	290	" Thanks very much . Sorry to have kept you up . "
162868	162884	162824	162824	he	290	" Thank you , sir . Good night , sir . Good night , miss . "
163334	163341	163343	163343	she	336	" This is urgent , sir , "
163369	163377	163379	163379	he	290	" It depends what you call urgent , "
163381	163410	163379	163379	he	290	" Seeing that I was n't expected back till Wednesday night , nothing can be urgent tillThursday morning . Supposing I had n't been here to - day ? "
164280	164297	164270	164270	he	290	" Excuse me for three minutes , will you , my boy ? I must just - "
164322	164341	164342	164342	he	290	" Put this in an envelope and take it to Mr. Cousin yourself - at once , please , "
164353	164362	164363	164364	Miss Cass	336	" But the Conference wo n't be finished , "
164367	164374	164376	164376	Evelyn	290	" I hope it wo n't , "
164418	164423	164456	164456	He	290	" Manager 's Office , "
165358	165368	165349	165349	She	336	" Mr. Orcham asked me to give you this . "
165390	165396	165382	165383	Miss Cass	336	" Better wait a moment . "
165404	165424	165398	165398	he	334	" I think I will read this to you just as it is - it 's from Mr. Orcham , "
165437	165742	165434	165434	he	334	" I can think of a number of reasons both for and against the very interesting proposal for arranging for a New Year 's Eve festivity in the grill - room . But there is one reason which in my opinion outweighs all others and which ought to settle the point . The grill - room has always been a place free from every rule except that of good manners . At any time of day or evening anyone can enter it in any dress , and order any meal , which will be charged either a la carteor at a prix fixe according to the judgment of the manager . No formalities are observed . The grill - room has a very large clientele which is aware of this state of things and counts on it . It is universally known as a restaurant of relaxation , where food of the finest sort can be eaten at ease and in quietness . Thousands of customers look on it as a retreat upon which they can rely . It is open every night of the year . No holiday or fete has even been allowed to disturb its normal course . What would its habitués think if one night its character were to be altered , and a definite menu and hour imposed upon them , with various unavoidable rules affecting dress , etc . , and the introduction of music and a formal entertainment ? Any such alteration would be a blow to the particular reputation of the grill - room . It would cause disappointment and possibly some resentment . Confidence in the stability of the policy of the grill - room would unquestionably be undermined . Which would be , I think , a rather serious matter . - EVELYN ORCHAM . "
165915	165919	165921	165922	Mr. Cousin	334	" Thank you , "
165967	165973	165975	165976	Mr. Cousin	334	" Well , my friends - "
166026	166033	166035	166036	Miss Powler	353	" If you will excuse me , "
166269	166273	166255	166255	Ceria	511	" My office . "
166367	166375	166376	166376	he	511	" I beg your pardon . Please , "
166472	166481	166466	166466	She	353	" You should n't take it too hard . "
166500	166547	166487	166487	She	353	" About the special Floors - menu for to - morrow , Mr. Ceria . Could I have a copy of it to - day ? It 's useful to me to know beforehand what it is ... If I 'm not disturbing you too much . "
166636	166641	166642	166642	Ceria	511	" Yes , certainly , "
166647	166666	166667	166667	He	511	" Please sit down . Have this chair . I 'll find it . I 'll find it . "
166722	166747	166749	166749	Violet	353	" You ought to go home as early as you can this afternoon and do a bit of hard work in your beautiful garden , "
166787	166807	166785	166785	Violet	353	" How could I suggest his going back to that empty house , with nobody but a servant there ? "
166813	166834	166810	166810	he	511	" At this season ... one can not work in the garden . What can one do in the garden ? "
166835	166841	166842	166842	Violet	353	" How stupid of me ! "
166856	166866	166867	166867	Ceria	511	" And it is nearly dark at four o'clock , "
166879	166882	166884	166884	Ceria	511	" But , "
166886	166912	166884	166884	Ceria	511	" I will go for a drive in my little car . I adore driving in the dark . I will go a long distance . "
166925	166944	166945	166945	Violet	353	" How many days is it since you first thought of the fete in your grill - room ? "
166949	166953	166945	166945	Violet	353	" Not many . "
166961	166967	166954	166954	Ceria	511	" No . Not many . "
166968	166982	166984	166984	Violet	353	" Well , you are no worse off now than you were then , "
166986	166994	166995	166995	Ceria	511	" You are a very kind philosopher , "
166998	167015	166995	166995	Ceria	511	" Yes , you are very kind . I understand you . It is a lesson . "
167016	167021	167022	167022	Violet	353	" No , no ! "
167025	167036	167022	167022	Violet	353	" Please excuse me . I only thought of it . "
167131	167138	167124	167125	Instantly Ceria	511	" Come in , Miss Venables . "
167153	167163	167165	167165	she	5668	" I 'm leaving this afternoon , Mr. Ceria , "
167167	167179	167165	167165	she	5668	" And I could not go without saying good - bye . "
167217	167226	167227	167227	Violet	353	" Well , thank you , Mr. Ceria , "
167232	167251	167227	167227	Violet	353	" Perhaps you could send that menu up to me . Or I will send down for it . "
167252	167260	167262	167262	Ceria	511	" You shall have it at once , "
167672	167685	167686	167686	she	466	" There 's a lamp - stand broken in 06 , miss , "
167690	167702	167703	167703	Violet	353	" But you 've told me about that once , Beaty , "
167708	167760	167686	167686	she	466	" Oh ! Have I ? So I have , miss . Better twice than not at all , they do say . Yes , miss . I hear Miss Prentiss has gone , miss . And I know her trunks is gone . They 're labelled for Gleneagles , miss . "
167761	167774	167776	167776	Violet	353	" I wonder how you hear of all these things , Beaty , "
167778	167786	167776	167776	Violet	353	" It 's very clever of you . "
167927	167950	167914	167914	she	353	" And what 's the news to - day about Miss Maclaren , miss ? I suppose you 'll have been hearing ? "
167951	167964	167914	167914	she	353	" A bit better . She 's eaten part of an omelette . "
167965	168012	167914	167914	she	353	" Well , that is wonderful news , miss . An omelette ! Do you think I might go and see her ? Me and Daisy was saying last night as perhaps I might . Just to show like , if you know what I mean . "
168013	168031	167914	167914	she	353	" She 'd be very pleased . But you ought n't to stay more than ten minutes . "
168032	168079	167914	167914	she	353	" Oh no , miss ! Such an idea would n't enter my head . I 've got a wrist - watch and I should wear it , and I should look at it when I went in and ... Miss Venables has n't gone yet , miss
168080	168084	168085	168085	Violet	484	" I know , "
168120	168129	168094	168095	Mrs. Noakes	466	" I 've seen Miss Venables , downstairs . "
168130	168144	168146	168146	Beatrice	466	" Oh ! I 'm so glad she 's seen you , miss , "
168205	168211	168213	168213	Violet	484	" Let me come past , "
168216	168229	168213	168213	Violet	484	" I 've got plenty to do , if you have n't . "
168353	168362	168350	168350	her	489	" Anything urgent you want me to do ? "
168368	168383	168385	168385	Violet	484	" Better go and get your lunch , if it is n't too early , "
168393	168397	168399	168399	she	489	" Five minutes , "
168583	168602	168580	168580	Venables	491	" I thought I 'd tell you . They 've just telephoned up that Mrs. Oulsnam has come . "
168603	168634	168580	168580	Venables	491	" Oh , thank you very much for letting me know , Venables . I suppose she 'll come to see me . I was just going down to lunch . "
168820	168825	168827	168827	Venables	491	" Not at all , "
168829	168841	168842	168842	Violet	484	" I do hope you 'll be happy at the Majestic , "
168873	168928	168856	168856	Her	484	" Oh , thank you , Powler . I feel sure I shall . You know the Majestic is going to be very much livened up . I heard yesterday they are to make a new carpet for the restaurant there at our works . But I expect you know all about that already . "
168929	168936	168938	168938	Violet	353	" No , I do n't , "
168950	168957	168959	168959	Venables	491	" And here 's my keys , "
168969	168972	168974	168974	Venables	491	" Well , "
168976	168985	168974	168974	Venables	491	" I suppose I must be saying goodbye . "
169012	169027	169029	169029	Venables	491	" I know it was n't your fault . You could n't help it , "
169040	169046	169035	169035	Violet	353	" Could n't help what ? "
169052	169063	169049	169049	she	353	" I knew you knew . It 's all right . "
169067	169091	169064	169064	Venables	491	" But I 've never been treated like that before . Never . And you must admit it was very humiliating , dear . "
169092	169099	169100	169100	Violet	353	" I 'm sure it was , "
169103	169143	169100	169100	Violet	353	" But it was for such a short time . It was n't worth while appointing you head - housekeeper for such a short time as that . And you have n't been humiliated for long , have you ? "
169218	169221	169223	169223	Violet	353	" And , "
169281	169361	169270	169270	she	5727	" She could hardly prevent herself from crying , though she did not really believe that she would ever be as old and withered and desiccated as Venables . She was mournful . But she was happy . Venables went off with the subdued self - contemplating smile of one who has righteously performed his duty to society , recognising virtue in a junior colleague , increasing the sum of kindness , and with resigned courage fronting a hard world .
169638	169651	169627	169627	Mowlem	312	" A Happy New Year , sir , if not too early . "
169652	169659	169627	169627	Mowlem	312	" Thanks . Same to you . "
170291	170301	170302	170302	he	511	" Is everything as you wish , Miss Savott ? "
170338	170343	170344	170344	Evelyn	290	" Well , Ceria , "
170355	170408	170352	170352	his	511	" I congratulate you . You could n't have done better than this if you 'd had a dozen bands and the whole New Year rigmarole . You could n't have done as well , because a band takes up a deuce of a lot of valuable room . Now could you ? "
170409	170419	170352	170352	his	511	" No , sir . You are quite right . "
170420	170430	170352	170352	his	511	" You 'll beat your record to - night . "
170431	170437	170439	170441	the delighted Ceria	511	" I shall , sir , "
170446	170454	170443	170443	Evelyn	290	" He 's just like a child . "
170581	170589	170590	170590	she	2690	" You can have this table now , "
170595	170603	170590	170590	she	2690	" My friends evidently are n't coming . "
171344	171357	171335	171335	Savott	296	" Now , Harry , do n't behave like a spoiled beauty . "
171608	171622	171623	171623	he	379	" Let me make you acquainted with the most beautiful woman in London , "
171739	171764	171736	171736	he	379	" Nothing is simpler . I have a table , and if Mrs. Penkethman and you will dine with me I shall be charmed . "
171826	171832	171833	171833	Savott	296	" Do n't tell me , "
171836	171854	171833	171833	Savott	296	" I know I 'm late . Three minutes . It 's your traffic outside that did it "
171855	171865	171867	171867	Evelyn	290	" You are n't late , my dear fellow , "
171869	171892	171867	171867	Evelyn	290	" Every clock in the hotel is wrong . Lord Watlington and Mrs. Penkethman are joining us . Shall we go in ? "
173068	173109	173055	173055	she	385	" And where is my darling Gracie to - night ? Do you know , she 's very naughty . I have n't heard from her for weeks , and she writes such amusing letters - when she does write . "
173110	173125	173127	173128	Sir Henry	296	" Do you think I 've heard from her , any more than you ? "
173135	173170	173127	173128	Sir Henry	296	" I suppose she 's in Paris . On the other hand she may be somewhere all by herself in the country near Paris . Last news I had she was writing a book . "
173171	173177	173179	173180	Lord Watlington	379	" A novel of course , "
173186	173189	173191	173191	Evelyn	290	" No , "
173193	173226	173191	173191	Evelyn	290	" I do n't think it 's a novel . She did say 5ornething to me about it , but I forget what . Sort of journal of impressions , I fancy . "
173227	173234	173235	173235	Savott	296	" Yes , you 're right , "
173247	173259	173261	173262	Lord Watlington	379	" Well , anyway it wo n't be like anything else , "
173264	173281	173261	173262	Lord Watlington	379	" She has more brains than any other woman I ever met - yes , my dear "
173285	173312	173283	173283	Nancy	385	" and you may rely on her to write down absolutely anything that comes into her head . You 'd better see the proofs , Henry . "
173313	173334	173400	173400	Savott	297	" I should have to bribe the printers then , Harry . Gracie would die before she 'd show them . "
173335	173342	173344	173345	Lord Watlington	379	" I always see Nancy 's , "
173347	173369	173344	173345	Lord Watlington	379	" I 've kept her out of trouble more than once . I ca n't imagine why she keeps on writing . "
173370	173375	173377	173378	Mrs. Penkethman	380	" Who ? Me ? "
173381	173386	173387	173388	Lord Watlington	379	" Yes , you ! "
173393	173398	173400	173400	Savott	297	" Yes , you ! "
173459	173469	173470	173470	she	385	" But I must write . I have to , "
173491	173504	173470	173470	she	385	" You 're my friend , are n't you , Mr. Orcham ? "
173505	173513	173470	173470	she	385	" Count on me , Mrs. Penkethman . "
173531	173535	173470	173470	she	385	" Sunday Mercury . "
173802	173811	173813	173814	Sir Henry	296	" Gracie ought by rights to try this , "
173976	173989	173990	173990	Evelyn	290	" That , I venture to think , is a unique hock , "
174001	174018	173990	173990	Evelyn	290	" Anyone who prefers champagne will kindly say the word . But that - isa hock . "
174023	174027	174029	174029	he	296	" It is , "
174136	174139	174141	174141	Evelyn	290	" Barbarians , "
174780	174783	174785	174785	Nancy	385	" Harry ! "
174793	174796	174797	174797	Nancy	385	" Harry ! "
174912	174922	174924	174925	Sir Henry	296	" You look like winning - over this meal , "
174937	174948	174949	174949	Evelyn	290	" I hope you 'll think so after the savoury , "
175122	175137	175099	175099	he	296	" This fellow is the goods . He ca n't possibly let us down . "
175184	175205	175181	175181	he	296	" There 's a damn sight more in this fellow than some people might suppose , to look at him . "
175421	175428	175419	175419	Evelyn	290	" This simply wo n't do . "
175455	175460	175461	175461	Evelyn	290	" What is it ? "
175471	175513	175552	175553	the man	1015	" There 's a young lady very ill upstairs , sir , and I was looking for Dr. Constam . They said he was here , but I ca n't see him . And I ca n't see Mr. Cousin either . "
175514	175521	175552	175553	the man	1015	" Very ill , you say ? "
175522	175530	175552	175553	the man	1015	" Yes , sir . Very ill . "
175531	175535	175552	175553	the man	1015	" What number ? "
175536	175541	175552	175553	the man	1015	" 365 , sir . "
175542	175545	175552	175553	the man	1015	" What ? "
175546	175551	175552	175553	the man	1015	" 365 , sir , "
175564	175571	175573	175573	Evelyn	290	" I 'll attend to it , "
175575	175586	175588	175590	Sir Henry Savott	296	" 365 . That 's one of my old numbers , "
175598	175606	175607	175608	Lord Watlington	379	" Are you staying here , Henry ? "
175611	175623	175607	175608	Lord Watlington	379	" No , Harry . I 'm in my new house . "
175624	175635	175636	175636	Evelyn	290	" Will you kind people excuse me for a minute ? "
175639	175646	175636	175636	Evelyn	290	" I 'm sorry , but - "
175658	175673	175651	175651	He	290	" Though why the devil I should attend to it I do n't know . "
175934	175940	175941	175941	she	5691	" Good evening , sir , "
176037	176062	176025	176025	Violet	353	" Someone very ill here , I understand . I looked in myself because both Mr. Cousin and Mr. Pozzi have their hands full . "
176063	176087	176088	176088	She	353	" Yes , sir . The doctor is in there , and I 'm waiting to see if I can do anything else . "
176096	176102	176088	176088	She	353	" Who 's staying here ? "
176103	176107	176088	176088	She	353	" Miss Savott . "
176108	176118	176088	176088	She	353	" Miss Savott - not Sir Henry Savott 's - "
176119	176131	176132	176132	she	353	" Yes , sir ... It 's a miscarriage , sir , "
176278	176294	176297	176297	he	799	" You do n't mean to say that Miss Savott 's here and she 's - "
176370	176376	176378	176378	Violet	353	" Oh no , sir , "
176383	176404	176378	176378	Violet	353	" It 's a - friend of hers that she brought with her . I do n't know the name . "
176491	176494	176495	176495	Evelyn	290	" Yes ? "
176498	176510	176512	176513	the reveIler	5997	" I 'm dining in the same party as Dr. Constam , "
176528	176551	176512	176513	the reveIler	5997	" He asked me to follow him as soon as I could . I 'm a nurse . Where is the patient ? "
176590	176618	176563	176564	the reveller	5999	" You do n't expect to see them in party frocks , do you ? ' said Evelyn with a short laugh to cover his nervous diffidence . "
176635	176635	176636	176636	Violet	353	"
176644	176651	176652	176652	he	0	" When did this thing begin ? "
176825	176837	176839	176839	Evelyn	290	" It 's amazing what pranks women will play with themselves , "
176845	176861	176839	176839	Evelyn	290	" Fancy a woman - ! When was the birth expected , do you know ? "
176862	176873	176908	176908	She	9790	" I think the lady is over six months gone . "
176874	176890	176839	176839	Evelyn	290	" And them crossing the Channel on a rough day in the middle of winter ! "
176911	176949	176908	176908	She	9790	" The chambermaid told me she had drawn the curtains as usual , but Miss Savott had undrawn them again . Said she liked to see the lights . That must have been before the trouble started . "
176958	176978	176954	176954	Evelyn	290	" I 'm surprised to find you on duty to - night , Miss Powler . How is it ? "
176979	176982	176984	176984	Violet	353	" Well , "
176986	177039	176984	176984	Violet	353	" it 's not one of my evenings , and Miss Ducker - she 's the newest , sir : Sixth - really did want to go to a party at Hammersmith , so I let her go . I 'm easier in my mind if I 'm here on the spot . "
177040	177052	177053	177053	Evelyn	290	" You should n't be . You must get over that . "
177226	177234	177220	177220	he	290	" I think we might sit down . "
177243	177247	177248	177248	he	290	" Sit down , "
177415	177425	177426	177426	he	290	" I do n't know a lot about miscarriages , "
177436	177448	177426	177426	he	290	" I may as well talk to her in her own language "
177450	177493	177426	177426	he	290	" but it seems to me that that doctor of ours ca n't get on with his work without some - er - apparatus that he has n't got in there . He did n't bring anything with him , I suppose ? "
177494	177514	177426	177426	he	290	" No , sir . When he came I do n't think he even knew what was the matter . "
177515	177529	177531	177531	he	290	" Well , it 's all very odd to an amateur like me . "
177534	177561	177531	177531	he	290	" Why am I staying here ? I ca n't be of any help . It must be just sheer curiosity that 's keeping me here . "
177572	177578	177579	177579	he	438	" Oh , good evening ! "
177609	177741	177742	177742	He	6030	" It 's no more a miscarriage than my boot . Everything 's absolutely normal so far as that goes . Nothing but an attack of indigestion . I thought you ladies could never surprise me any more , but I was wrong . The creature puts out to sea , feels queer , fills herself up with champagne and God knows what . Train journey and so on . She gets here all right , and then as soon as the tension is loosed and she has time to think about herself she has rather acute indigestion . Pains in the tummy . Must be a miscarriage ! Miscarriage be blowed ! I tell you I told her I could n't help laughing at her . That did her good . "
177749	177824	177742	177742	He	6030	" Here I am eating my New Year 's dinner , and I have to rush upstairs because a girl 's got the collywobbles . The biscuit is hers , and I hope she 'll have twins . I 'm just going to find something to soothe her precious alimentary tract . Sha n't be two minutes . No earthly need for you to stay , Miss Powler . Nurse is undressing her properly . "
177825	177829	177830	177830	Evelyn	290	" I say , "
177841	177844	177830	177830	Evelyn	290	" Yes ? "
177845	177850	177742	177742	He	6030	" Who is she ? "
177851	177858	177859	177859	He	756	" Ask me another , sir . "
177979	177985	177987	177987	Violet	353	" I 'm so glad , "
177990	177993	178006	178006	Violet	353	" Yes . "
177994	178000	178006	178006	Violet	353	" Good night , sir . "
178001	178005	178006	178006	Violet	353	" Good night . "
178126	178130	178131	178131	he	11430	" Au revoir , "
178166	178177	178178	178178	he	290	" I must look a bit odd , sitting here , "
178340	178343	178344	178344	she	297	" Oh ! "
178350	178361	178362	178362	he	290	" I just came up to see how things were , "
178367	178375	178376	178376	she	297	" That was very kind of you , "
178386	178408	178376	178376	she	297	" I wish that doctor of yours had been as kind - I suppose he 's told you what 's happened . "
178409	178412	178413	178413	Evelyn	290	" Why ! "
178442	178452	178423	178423	He	290	" He has n't been unkind , has he ? "
178453	178464	178465	178465	Gracie	297	" Yes , he has been unkind , very unkind , "
178488	178529	178472	178472	she	297	" He laughed . That 's what your doctor did . Laughed . That was all he could do . Doctors are awful , especially when they 're young . Cruel . They do n't seem to have any imagination . "
178530	178541	178542	178542	Evelyn	290	" But everything 's all right , is n't it ? "
178552	178559	178542	178542	Evelyn	290	" She 'll want some handling . "
178713	178724	178700	178700	she	297	" No , Please ! I could n't bear that ! "
178751	178757	178758	178758	she	297	" Everything 's all right , "
178762	179269	178758	178758	she	297	" But that 's not the point . That poor girl 's going to have a baby . Which is something , I hope , in a girl 's life . She thought she was in for a horrible mess . I thought so too . How could she tell it was n't that , much less me? ... Last May it was - she 'd been making love . She 's been carrying that baby for over six months . Fancy what it means , all that . Night and day . Well , of course you ca n't . But I can . I 've seen it all the time . I tell you it 's simply terrific . And then she thinks she 's going to lose the baby . All that trouble for nothing ! Wasted in a most frightful mess ! Ca n't you feel it ? Ca n't you feel the awfulness of it ? Could n't the doctor feel it ? She was mistaken . She was n't going to lose the baby . But her agony - yes , agony - was just as real to her as though she had been going to lose it . And this doctor of yours merely laughs at her ! Jokes ! What does he think a woman is ? He does n't know the first thing about being a doctor . Any fool who 's passed his examinations can tell the difference between a miscarriage and a bad attack of tummy - ache . But it takes a man to feel . And that doctor ca n't . He is n't a man . He 's a - there 's no word for him ... Teases her about some champagne she 'd had , on the top of some peaches and some seasickness medicine ! Well , if you want to know , it was I who gave her the champagne , and I gave her the peaches . It is n't as if I had n't had her examined before we started . My French doctor saw her . He said she was in splendid health . Never seen anyone better , he said , and it was perfectly safe for her to travel , and if she did have a bit of a shaking up it would n't do her any harm . And the voyage was n't really so bad . It was n't good , but it was n't bad , though it was rather worse than we expected , I admit . And she was quite all right till she had the champagne on the train . Even here she walked by herself to the lift . She was so much all right that I went down to the grill - room to eat something . But as soon as I 'd gone her nerves went queer and the pains began . She rang and I was fetched . I can understand it well enough . "
179270	179275	179276	179276	Evelyn	290	" Yes , yes , "
179293	179300	179287	179287	he	290	" Who is this young lady ? "
179304	179307	179308	179308	she	297	" Tessa , "
179315	179318	178758	178758	she	297	" Tessa ? "
179319	179328	179276	179276	Evelyn	290	" Yes , Tessa Tye , my maid . "
179329	179339	178758	178758	she	297	" I do n't think I 've seen her . "
179340	179388	179276	179276	Evelyn	290	" Of course you 've seen her . She came into the hotel with me that morning when you were standing in the hall . Very pretty . And rather smart too . Do n't you remember . She 's pretty enough for any man to remember . "
179389	179393	179394	179394	Evelyn	290	" Oh yes , "
179426	179432	179423	179423	He	290	" Married? ... Or not ? "
179433	179937	179276	179276	Evelyn	290	" Why do you say ' or not ' ? Why should n't she be married ? Ca n't maids be married ? Ca n't they have their own lives like other people ? However , she is n't married , as it happens . That 's why I made up my mind to look after her . It may interest you to know - I have n't told anyone else - to know that when we got here that first morning she tried to commit suicide . Opening a vein with a pair of scissors . Yes , that was how she felt then . That was why I kept you waiting before you took me to Smithfield . Oh , I did n't find out till later what it was she 'd been up to . I thought it was an accident with the scissors . But I got it out of her in the end , when I noticed her body and it was staring me in the face ! I could n't believe it at first - you never do ... Some half - English , half - Belgian rotter she 'd fallen in love with in Paris . She fell for him and then he ran away . She did n't know his address . I doubt if she knew his real name . She carried that baby to New York with me and back again . And I had n't guessed - it was n't till after we 'd gone to Paris again from here that she confessed . I was n't going to throw her over then . No ! What I had to do was to put some self - respect into her . I took her to St. Cloud . It suited me , because I wanted to be quiet to write my book . A little hotel there . Only one bathroom for the two of us . I called her a friend of mine , Mrs. Tye . I could see her growing before my eyes . We made no bones about it . We went around for walks just as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world . And so it is . When we left St. Cloud you could see how she was half a mile off . Some of them must have noticed it in the hall downstairs this afternoon , though she was wearing a big cloak . She 's been maiding me just the same . It would n't have done for her to be idle . And the doctor , I mean the French one , said it would do her all the good in the world to work - stoop , run about - you know . And she 's a different girl . It 's set her up . She used to be anamic and namby - pamby . All that 's gone . It 'll be the making of her . "
179938	179949	179423	179423	He	290	" But why have you brought her here to London ? "
179950	179979	179980	179980	Gracie	297	" I brought her because I had to come about my book . And I thought we should be as safe here in a big hotel as anywhere . "
179991	180095	179980	179980	Gracie	297	" I could n't leave her behind . She 'd have fretted to death by herself . And I do n't quite see why my business should be held up because she 's going to have a baby . She 's got to take the rough with the smooth , the same as the rest of us . Do n't think I coddle her . I shall be coddling her in about ten weeks ' time , I expect . But not yet . We shall only be here for a few days . I 've made all the arrangements at St. Cloud . "
180135	180142	180143	180143	he	290	" Not now . Not yet , "
180149	180155	180156	180156	he	290	" Does your father know ? "
180165	180177	180326	180326	her	6053	" No . Of course he does n't know . Why ? "
180178	180194	180291	180291	She	6053	" Well , he 's dining with me at this moment . That 's all . "
180195	180202	180326	180326	her	6053	" Here ? In the hotel ? "
180203	180219	180291	180291	She	6053	" In the restaurant . Him , and your friend Mrs. Penkethman and Lord Watlington . "
180220	180241	180326	180326	her	6053	" But I heard from him at Christmas . I thought he was going to the Bahamas for a holiday . "
180242	180265	180291	180291	She	6053	" He may be . But he 's dining with me to - night . I left them to come up here . "
180266	180274	180326	180326	her	6053	" Does he know I 'm here ? "
180275	180280	180291	180291	She	6053	" He does not . "
180281	180290	180291	180291	She	6053	" Is he staying here in the hotel ? "
180298	180313	180326	180326	her	6053	" No , he 's in the new house , so he told me . "
180314	180322	180326	180326	her	6053	" And I have n't seen it . "
180329	180371	180326	180326	her	6053	" Well , he must be frightfully taken with the new house . This is the first New Year he 's spent in London for years . If I 'd known he was to be in London I should n't have - "
180510	180521	180522	180522	he	290	" ' Interesting ' is the right word for it , "
180559	180562	180564	180564	Gracie	297	" Tessa ! "
180580	180600	180568	180568	She	297	" What in God 's name are you doing ? Go back to bed this instant and keep warm . "
180657	180662	180663	180663	Gracie	297	" Fools girls are ! "
180671	180714	180663	180663	Gracie	297	" Well , I think you 'd better go back to your dinner now . And mind , do n't say a word to father . He 'd go in right off at the deep end . You do n't know father . "
180715	180723	180725	180725	Evelyn	290	" Very well . I do n't , "
180730	180746	180727	180727	He	6057	" What separate lives they lead ! And her mother - somewhere in the background . "
180751	180770	180747	180747	They	6058	" Good night . I think you 're wonderful . This is the greatest story I ever heard . "
180794	180805	180791	180791	She	6059	" Everyone 's wonderful when it comes to the point . "
180937	180945	180946	180946	she	6059	" So glad to see you again ! "
180969	180980	180982	180982	Evelyn	290	" I 'm extremely sorry to have been so long , "
180995	181018	180982	180982	Evelyn	290	" I really could n't help it . You know , you never do know what will happen next in a hotel . "
181097	181123	181125	181126	Lord Watlington	379	" We were beginning to suspect a fire had broken out somewhere upstairs , and you were keeping it dark for the sake of business , "
181135	181138	181139	181139	he	290	" No , "
181143	181150	181139	181139	he	290	" It was n't a fire . "
181414	181419	181390	181394	A ceaseless procession of revellers	6080	" Ballroom . Attractions . "
181420	181439	181440	181440	Evelyn	290	" I think now is the moment for us to go and see these mysterious ' attractions ' , "
181443	181465	181440	181440	Evelyn	290	" It will be midnight before we know where we are , and by midnight we simply must be here again . "
181466	181473	181475	181476	Nancy Penkethman	385	" But your dinner , darling ! "
181486	181494	181475	181476	Nancy Penkethman	385	" You have n't eaten a mouthful . "
181495	181502	181503	181503	Evelyn	290	" No , I have n't , "
181506	181533	181503	181503	Evelyn	290	" Unless soup , fish , and entrée are worthy to be called a mouthful . But there 'll be some supper after Auld Lang Syne . "
182211	182221	182227	182236	the renowned chief toast - master of the Imperial Palace	6120	" Ladies and gentlemen . A quarter to midnight . "
182291	182298	182299	182299	Nancy	385	" What are you laughing at ? "
182322	182329	182330	182330	Evelyn	290	" Punch and Judy of course , "
182545	182548	182542	182543	The band	5866	" Tipperary . "
182851	182855	182842	182843	The band	5866	" The Meistersingers . "
182931	182936	182937	182937	he	6150	" Well , sir ? "
182941	182956	182958	182958	Evelyn	290	" All my congratulations . Not a single hitch . A Happy New Year , "
182992	183002	183003	183003	He	6150	" Thank you , sir . Same to you . "
183027	183034	183036	183037	Lord Watlington	379	" Well , my dear host , "
183044	183086	183036	183037	Lord Watlington	379	" It 's all been extremely impressive . I admire your organisation as much as I like your hospitality . Ever so many thanks . You 'll excuse me if I go . I ca n't stand up against late hours . "
183087	183096	183098	183098	Nancy	385	" So sweet of you , Mr. Orcham , "
183106	183130	183098	183098	Nancy	385	" I 've simply loved it . I never had such a New Year 's Eve before . Thank you ten million times . "
183131	183139	183141	183141	Evelyn	290	" Very good of you to come , "
183144	183151	183098	183098	Nancy	385	" Bye - bye , Henry . "
183152	183159	183160	183160	Henry	379	" Bye - bye , Harry . "
183250	183256	183257	183257	he	296	" I say , Evelyn , "
183261	183279	183257	183257	he	296	" what day are you going back to Paris ? You are going , are n't you ? "
183280	183318	183407	183408	Sir Henry	296	" Yes . But I ca n't settle the date till I hear that the Concorde manager - what 's the name , Laugier ? - has got over his attack of flu and can answer questions . "
183319	183327	183329	183330	Sir Henry	296	" I can tell you that now , "
183332	183364	183329	183330	Sir Henry	296	" He was back at work to - day . A fellow told me before I came here to - night , who 'd seen him this morning at the Concorde . "
183365	183392	183407	183408	Sir Henry	296	" Oh ! Well , then , I may go as soon as I 've wired him and got his answer . I 'll telephone you . "
183393	183402	183329	183330	Sir Henry	296	" I 'll see you before you start ? "
183403	183406	183407	183408	Sir Henry	296	" Certainly . "
183998	184006	184008	184009	the conductor	1964	" Boys , here 's the boss ! "
184022	184030	184013	184013	he	1964	" Wish him a Happy New Year . "
184182	184186	184175	184175	himself	3408	" You finished ? "
184187	184192	184193	184193	Ceria	511	" Nearly , sir . "
184232	184242	184175	184175	himself	3408	" Well , you 've had a good evening . "
184243	184248	184175	184175	himself	3408	" Wonderful , sir . "
184249	184261	184175	184175	himself	3408	" Going to have a look at the restaurant , eh ? "
184310	184313	184315	184315	he	511	" Noisy , "
184491	184540	184488	184488	He	511	" Why the devil did that girl choose this place to come to ? It could n't have been because she had a notion she might perhaps come across me again here , could it ? She never apologised to me for her damnable rudeness about her party . "
184613	184639	184661	184661	Evelyn	290	" You remember you promised to go one night to that Shaftesbury Express lunch - and - supper - counter place . Have you been ? "
184680	184689	184690	184690	he	511	" What on earth place do you mean ? "
184779	184788	184796	184796	her	297	" Oh , dear ! What a memory ! "
184807	184811	184812	184812	he	511	" Oh yes ! "
184815	184824	184812	184812	he	511	" I do remember something of the kind . "
184825	184832	184796	184796	her	297	" Well , have you been ? "
184833	184848	184849	184849	He	511	" No . It 's never crossed my mind from that day to this . "
184852	184865	184849	184849	He	511	" I bet anything she wants me to take her there tonight ! "
184866	184884	184796	184796	her	297	" Well , do n't you think you ought to go ? A promise is a promise . "
184885	184896	184897	184897	he	511	" But surely it was you that promised to go , "
184900	184906	184796	184796	her	297	" Now do n't pretend ! "
184943	184957	184936	184936	he	511	" You know as well as I do it was you who promised . "
184958	184969	184970	184970	he	511	" Well , one of these days I will go , "
184974	185005	184936	184936	he	511	" That 's just the same as saying you have n't the slightest intention of ever going . I should like to go to - night . Let 's go . "
185011	185018	184936	184936	he	511	" Are you in evening dress ? "
185019	185024	185025	185025	he	511	" I am not , "
185028	185056	185025	185025	he	511	" I was in evening dress till pretty nearly three o'clock this morning , and I 'm taking a night off , if you 've no objection . "
185057	185062	184936	184936	he	511	" That 's splendid , "
185071	185113	184936	184936	he	511	" It will be a night off . If you 'd been in your glad rags , we could hardly have gone . An Express counter is n't quite a suitable atmosphere for a boiled shirt . Shall I come down ? "
185114	185118	184936	184936	he	511	" But listen - "
185119	185127	184936	184936	he	511	" No , I wo n't listen , "
185132	185227	184936	184936	he	511	" Because I know exactly what you 'd say if I let you . That 's perfectly all right . You and daddy are so thick in these days , it 's perfectly all right for your highness to be seen with me anywhere at any hour . And you need n't worry about not telling daddy that last night you knew I was here . If he gets to hear you can easily say you only found out to - day . Be a man . And do n't be so damned dignified . "
185260	185270	185271	185271	he	6220	" It would be a bit of a lark , "
185278	185286	185228	185230	The young voice	6219	" I 'm coming down this minute , "
185291	185296	185228	185230	The young voice	6219	" Where are you ? "
185297	185315	185320	185321	the voice	6221	" In my office . But look here . Is your car handy ? Mine is not . "
185316	185319	185320	185321	the voice	6221	" Car ! "
185324	185356	185320	185321	the voice	6221	" We ca n't arrive at an Express counter in Shaftesbury Avenue in a car . It simply is n't done . We 'll go in a taxi , of course . "
185357	185380	185320	185321	the voice	6221	" I 'll be in the entrance - hall . Try not to keep me waiting more than a couple of hours . "
185513	185519	185493	185494	Long Sam	294	" Taxi please , Sam . "
185520	185525	185527	185528	Sam Butcher	293	" Yes , sir , "

185542	185545	185536	185536	he	293	" Lively . "
185560	185568	185570	185570	Evelyn	290	" If I 'm wanted , Sam , "
185574	185604	185570	185570	Evelyn	290	" I 'm going out with Miss Savott to Jebson 's restaurant in Shaftesbury Avenue . I do n't expect to be more than an hour at the outside . "
185685	185696	185697	185698	the taxidriver	6231	" D'ye mean that little place close by the cinema ? "
185718	185721	185715	185715	he	6231	" Oh ! "
185821	185832	185834	185834	Gracie	297	" It does her good to bestir herself a bit , "
185836	185844	185846	185846	Evelyn	290	" I believe that is the theory , "
185848	185857	185859	185859	Gracie	297	" It 's the practice - with Tessa , "
185958	185963	185965	185965	Gracie	297	" C'est tres sympathique , "
185969	185975	185965	185965	Gracie	297	" I love the lampshades . "

186009	186012	186014	186014	Gracie	297	" No , "
186016	186029	186014	186014	Gracie	297	" We must sit at the bar . I adore a bar . "
186082	186085	186087	186087	Evelyn	290	" Now , "
186094	186103	186087	186087	Evelyn	290	" What do you serve here , please ? "
186104	186152	186162	186162	she	6249	" Well , sir . We serve the finest sandwiches in London . Salads . Oysters . And the finest chops and steaks in London - but only at lunch - time - I mean the chops and steaks . And cheeses of course - any hour . "
186181	186195	186197	186197	Evelyn	290	" I doubt if I 've ever had the finest sandwiches in London , "
186206	186211	186213	186213	Gracie	297	" I think oysters , "
186215	186219	186213	186213	Gracie	297	" and stout . "
186220	186230	186232	186232	Evelyn	290	" Stout ? At night ? Disturb my sleep , "
186234	186241	186242	186242	Gracie	297	" And what if it does ? "
186249	186264	186242	186242	Gracie	297	" Stout is such fun , and all fun has to be paid for . "
186265	186275	186277	186277	Evelyn	290	" Two dozen oysters and two stouts , please , "
186309	186318	186319	186322	the bar - woman	6249	" Two dozen Whits and two draught stouts , "
186331	186338	186339	186339	she	6249	" Very mild to - night , "
186346	186351	186352	186352	Evelyn	290	" Ye - es , "
186370	186373	186375	186375	Gracie	297	" Windy , "
186377	186380	186375	186375	Gracie	297	" Gusty . "
186381	186384	186386	186389	the bar - woman	6249	" Well , "
186397	186416	186386	186389	the bar - woman	6249	" if you 're motoring that does n't matter - unless of course it 's a touring car . "
186417	186425	186375	186375	Gracie	297	" I was thinking of the sea . "
186426	186479	186480	186481	All three	4690	" Oh ! Channel to - morrow morning . Yes , I suppose so . I 've never been over myself , that is , I mean since I was a baby - in - arms . I began my travelling early , I did , and left it off early too . "
186484	186512	186480	186481	All three	4690	" They do say there 's nothing like travelling for sharpening your wits . But what I say is a bar 's pretty good in that line . "
186630	186638	186620	186620	He	290	" What a rut I live in ! "
186639	186645	186646	186646	he	290	" I 'm not hungry , "
186650	186655	186656	186656	Gracie	297	" Neither am I , "
186659	186688	186656	186656	Gracie	297	" But not one of these oysters is going to be left . If you 'd only ordered a dozen between us I should have asked for more . "
186811	186827	186808	186808	He	290	" I wish I could get past her defences . There 's no getting near her "
186840	186957	186808	186808	He	290	" She must have a sort of a liking for me , otherwise she would n't run after me the way she does . She 's very curt and domineering . She 's infernally independent . She 's an egotist , ca n't be anything else . And yet - Tessa ! She is n't being very egotistical over Tessa . She 's taking risks there . But that may be egotism too . Wants to flatter herself she 's making a grand gesture , defying convention , being herself , going around with a maid as big as a barrel , and so on and so on . ' Maid ' : that 's good . "
187200	187222	187186	187186	he	6267	" There now ! You can go back to your cogitations again . You 've got something to think about now . "
187226	187248	187223	187223	He	6267	" I suppose as you 're leaving to - morrow you 've finished the business with your publisher to - day ? "
187249	187252	187253	187253	she	297	" Yes , "
187256	187262	187253	187253	she	297	" That 's all right . "
187263	187266	187267	187267	he	6267	" Well , "
187270	187296	187267	187267	he	6267	" there 's one thing . With your name on the title - page the book 's bound to make a stir in the world . "
187309	187321	187299	187299	her	297	" My name wo n't be on the title - page . "
187322	187328	187297	187297	She	297	" No ? Why not ? "
187329	187336	187337	187337	she	297	" Surely you do n't imagine , "
187340	187439	187337	187337	she	297	" Surely you do n't imagine for a moment I 'd let my book be helped by the name of a racing motorist and my father 's name and the name of a girl who knows all the smart people in London ! Because if you do you 're wrong . My book will have to stand by itself - or fall . I shall take a pseudonym . That 's what I came over about . My publisher was making a fuss over that very point ... He 's given in . So it 's all right . "
187473	187479	187480	187480	he	290	" You 're perfectly right ! "
187530	187540	187541	187541	she	297	" I knew you 'd know what I mean , "
187544	187564	187541	187541	she	297	" Some people simply do n't know the language you 're talking . It 's just jabber to them . "
187586	187600	187566	187566	she	297	" Can you tell us what time Mr. Jebson will be here night ? "
187621	187638	187601	187604	The bar - woman	6249	" Jim , what time will Mr. Jebson come in to - night , d'y know ? "
187649	187663	187601	187604	The bar - woman	6249	" The governor wo n't be along to - night . He telephoned . "
187664	187673	187674	187677	the bar - woman	6249	" Can my husband or me do anything ? "
187681	187686	187688	187688	Gracie	297	" No , thanks , "
187690	187710	187688	187688	Gracie	297	" It 's nothing . Only we know Jebson , and we thought if he happened to be here - "
187814	187817	187819	187819	she	297	" Well , "
187825	187833	187835	187835	she	297	" I 've finished my oysters , and "
187845	187852	187835	187835	she	297	" I 've finished my stout . "
187853	187860	187883	187886	The bar - woman	6249	" You 'd like to go ? "
187861	187874	187835	187835	she	297	" We may as well . But you 've not finished yours . "
187875	187879	187881	187881	Evelyn	290	" Ca n't , "
187925	187929	187931	187934	the bar - woman	6249	" Thank you , "
187949	187959	187946	187946	she	6249	" What name shall I say to Mr. Jebson ? "
187970	187975	187960	187960	Evelyn	290	" Does n't matter . "
187976	187981	187982	187982	Gracie	297	" Oh , darling ! "
187986	188001	187982	187982	Gracie	297	" I 'm sure Mr. Jebson would be delighted to know you 've called . "
188007	188017	188004	188005	the woman	1424	" Mr. Orcham , of the Imperial Palace Hotel . "
188125	188151	188116	188117	Her husband	888	" Mr. Jebson will be very proud , and very sorry to have missed you , sir . Good night . Good night , madam . "
188354	188362	188364	188364	Evelyn	290	" We 'll take one of these , "
188366	188372	188364	188364	Evelyn	290	" Ca n't we walk ? "
188373	188379	188382	188382	his	290	" Of course , darling . "
188466	188473	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" It 's going to snow , "
188477	188481	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" Oh no ! "
188482	188487	188489	188489	Evelyn	290	" It is snowing , "
188491	188513	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" Is it ? Well , never mind . I love walking in a snow - storm . Do n't you ? "
188514	188525	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" Yes . But you 'll get your feet wet . "
188526	188531	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" I can change . "
188532	188536	188475	188475	Evelyn	290	" So can I. "
188632	188637	188639	188639	Evelyn	290	" It 's raining , "
188641	188645	188647	188647	Gracie	297	" Let it , "
188657	188662	188663	188663	She	297	" It 's magnificent . "
188668	188675	188665	188665	her	297	" Think of a hot bath . "
188793	188810	188811	188811	He	290	" You were disappointed at our Mr. Jebson not being on view , were n't you ? "
188816	188822	188823	188823	Gracie	297	" I think I was , "
188829	188842	188897	188897	Evelyn	290	" You 've remembered him ever since Smithfield , have n't you ? "
188843	188848	188852	188852	her	297	" I certainly have . "
188855	188896	188897	188897	Evelyn	290	" Just tell me . What was there in him that was so interesting to you ? I must say I did n't find him terribly interesting . Just a well - set - up sort of a - brute . "
189083	189206	189079	189079	She	297	" Well - set - up ' brutes ' are n't so terrifically plentiful , you know . And a brute is so soothing to the nerves . And this particular brute is a worker . He 's getting something done , like we are . I loved his Express Counter . I could see his individuality all over it . Wholesome . And him getting up at 3 a.m. to go to Smithfield , and then looking after his lovely Express Counter last thing at night . She was funny , that starchy , wrinkled creature behind the counter ! It makes me smile , how jealous all men are . Anyhow , I 've never met one that was n't . "
189241	189247	189248	189248	he	6329	" I was only asking , "
189254	189261	189262	189262	she	297	" And I was only answering , "
189318	189321	189322	189322	she	297	" Oh ! "
189327	189351	189352	189352	She	297	" That 's marvellous , especially on a night like this . I do admire you for that . You 're a poet . "
189606	189606	189597	189597	You	290	"
189607	189610	189720	189720	Evelyn	290	" Yes . "
189611	189622	189597	189597	You	290	" There 'll be some rough going in the Channel . "
189623	189654	189720	189720	Evelyn	290	" Oh no ! It must have been blowing up for this when we came over . It will blow itself out to - night . Besides , who cares ? "
189655	189666	189667	189667	he	290	" I may possibly be down to see you off , "
189670	189674	189667	189667	he	290	" What time ? "
189675	189680	189681	189681	she	297	" Please do n't ! "
189685	189707	189681	189681	she	297	" I loathe being seen off . Monsieur Adolphe seeing me off is just as much as I can do with . "
189708	189719	189720	189720	Evelyn	290	" I understand . I should be the same myself , "
189816	189821	189823	189823	he	294	" Wet , sir , "
189899	189905	189907	189907	Evelyn	290	" Well , au revoir , "
189909	189916	189907	189907	Evelyn	290	" You mentioned a hot bath . "

190945	190951	190902	190902	She	304	" Everything 's all right ? "
190952	191002	190902	190902	She	304	" Perfect . We waited four days at the Lord Warden for the weather . I should n't have waited . But Tessa was really a bit alarmed at the look of the sea . Dover 's a very interesting place . I 'd no idea! ... And you ? "
191003	191023	190902	190902	She	304	" Hotel business in Paris . Your esteemed father 's business . You staying in Paris to - night ? "

192574	192579	192581	192581	Evelyn	290	" I could not , "
192658	192670	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" Could n't you manage to be free by ten o'clock ? "
192671	192676	192678	192678	Evelyn	290	" Sorry . Impossible , "
192682	192688	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" Then ten - thirty . "
192689	192694	192696	192696	Evelyn	290	" I might try , "
192703	192712	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" Why are you so cross with me ? "
192713	192721	192723	192723	Evelyn	290	" I 'm not at all cross , "
192725	192731	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" You 're very stiff . "
192732	192737	192738	192738	he	556	" Where are you ? "
192750	192757	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" In a call - box . "
192758	192772	192774	192774	Evelyn	290	" Well , you see , I 'm not . Do you understand ? "
192789	192797	192644	192646	a young woman	2027	" You mean you are n't alone ? "
192798	192801	192803	192803	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
192805	192868	192869	192869	She	304	" Well now , what about to - night ? Ten - thirty ? I must see you . It 's rather urgent . I had to come in to Paris to - day , and I must go back to St. Cloud some time to - night , but it does n't matter much what time . Where can we meet ? "
193047	193053	193041	193041	She	304	" It 's rather urgent . "
193076	193079	193080	193080	she	304	" Well , "
193086	193089	193080	193080	she	304	" Where ? "
193090	193094	193095	193095	he	556	" The Montaigne , "
193098	193129	193080	193080	she	304	" Oh no ! That wo n't do . I loathe your Montaigne . It 's just something chipped off Park Avenue . Listen ! You know the rue Scribe ? "
193130	193134	193135	193135	he	556	" I do , "
193139	193153	193080	193080	she	304	" I 'll be there in a car , on the Opera side . "
193154	193158	193159	193159	he	556	" Very well , "
193162	193169	193080	193080	she	304	" Ten - thirty , mind ! "
193170	193177	193080	193080	she	304	" Yes . Good - bye . "
193178	193184	193185	193185	She	304	" Who 's with you ? "
193195	193199	193201	193201	Evelyn	290	" The director , "
193218	193223	193080	193080	she	304	" Of the Concorde ? "
193224	193227	193185	193185	She	304	" Precisely . "
193228	193244	193080	193080	she	304	" Oh ! Laugier . Is n't he a dear ? Give him my love . "
193245	193253	193254	193254	He	556	" I will . Good - bye ! "
193330	193337	193338	193338	he	556	" She sends you her love , "
193346	193349	193338	193338	he	556	" Miss - "
193350	193354	193355	193355	Laugier	556	" Mademoiselle Gracie ? "
193367	193382	193383	193384	M. Laugier	556	" I imagined to myself that it was her voice when she spoke first . "
193392	193403	193408	193408	he	556	" Ah ! La belle creature ! La belle creature ! "
193446	193454	193456	193456	Evelyn	290	" Eh bien , mon cher directeur , "
193464	193472	193474	193474	Laugier	556	" Eh bien , mon cher directeur , "
193476	193482	193474	193474	Laugier	556	" Revenons a nos moutons . "
193744	193756	193741	193741	He	290	" Is this dignified ? Something furtive and illicit about it . "
194048	194056	194035	194035	men	1035	" She is doing it on purpose . "
194174	194180	194182	194182	Gracie	386	" I 'm frightfully punctual , "
194195	194200	194202	194202	Evelyn	290	" You are indeed , "
194208	194213	194187	194187	Her	386	" Do get in . "
194340	194344	194346	194346	he	290	" And now ? "
194383	194388	194390	194390	Gracie	386	" Well , darling , "
194392	194399	194400	194400	He	290	" You have n't shaken hands . "
194413	194444	194400	194400	He	290	" It 's much too early to do anything yet . What about going into the Opera for an hour ? They 're doing ' Le Chevalier a la Rose . "
194445	194450	194452	194452	Evelyn	290	" So I noticed , "
194454	194474	194452	194452	Evelyn	290	" But we shall never be able to get seats , at this time of night , shall we ? "
194475	194483	194484	194484	she	386	" Do n't let that trouble you , "
194487	194499	194484	194484	she	386	" You leave it to me , and you 'll see . "
194500	194506	194507	194507	he	290	" I should love it , "
194515	194526	194527	194527	she	386	" It 's the best of all the modern operas , "
194530	194538	194527	194527	she	386	" Of course you 've seen it . "
194539	194577	194610	194610	Evelyn	290	" Yes . I saw it in Naples . The boy chevalier , what's - his - name , was played by an aged dame with bow - legs . It finished at two in the morning . "
194591	194597	194598	194598	she	386	" Front of the Opera , "
194681	194686	194688	194688	Evelyn	290	" You 've won , "
195282	195288	195290	195290	Evelyn	290	" Why are we here ? "
195323	195343	195344	195344	she	304	" This and Napoleon 's tomb and the Folies - Bergere and the Louvre are the sights of Paris , "
195353	195361	195347	195347	Evelyn	290	" Is she a mind - reader ? "
195367	195384	195362	195362	He	6565	" That 's what makes the thing interesting . But is that why you came here ? "
195385	195395	195396	195396	she	304	" Do n't you love being a tourist sometimes ? "
195399	195446	195396	195396	she	304	" I get so tired of being superior I simply must have a change . Sometimes I feel like going into a shop in the rue de Rivoli and buying a Baedeker just to carry about with me . Do n't you understand what I mean ? "
195447	195450	195452	195452	Evelyn	290	" Certainly , "
195454	195463	195452	195452	Evelyn	290	" But then I never do feel superior . "
195464	195473	195474	195474	she	304	" No . I believe you never do , "
195487	195495	195496	195496	he	6565	" Except now , in this box , "
195500	195510	195511	195511	she	304	" You are in a mood to - day , "
195517	195535	195536	195536	Evelyn	290	" Is n't that one of the Cheddars down there ? Fourth row ? Near the middle ? "
195551	195560	195561	195561	she	304	" Where ? Oh yes . I see , "
195565	195583	195561	195561	she	304	" Yes , it is . That 's Leo . I wonder what he 's doing here ? "
195584	195594	195596	195596	Evelyn	290	" He 's taking a rest from being superior , "
195598	195607	195596	195596	Evelyn	290	" Look at the Baedeker on his knee . "
195608	195612	195613	195613	Gracie	304	" Not a - "
195617	195623	195624	195624	she	304	" You 're teasing me ! "
195859	195865	195866	195866	Evelyn	290	" Why are we here ? "
195948	195963	195945	195945	Evelyn	290	" How robust , how coarse , is a woman 's taste in pleasure ! "
196047	196055	196036	196036	He	290	" The Nature of the Physical World . "
196089	196092	196093	196093	She	304	" Evelyn ! "
196149	196160	196162	196162	Gracie	304	" We were wondering why you are in this galley , "
196166	196197	196137	196137	His	6588	" But you know wherever I am I never miss a performance of the ' Rosenkavalier'if I can possibly help . I 'm hearing it here for the first time . "
196198	196207	196208	196208	Evelyn	290	" And what do you think of it ? "
196211	196232	196233	196233	He	290	" The performance ? The worst I have ever seen . Ignoble in every detail , except the oboe playing . "
196237	196251	196233	196233	He	290	" But the opera . The most enchanting thing since ' Figaro ' . "
196252	196255	196257	196257	Gracie	304	" Enchanting , "
196259	196272	196276	196276	her	304	" That is always Leo 's adjective for the ' Rosenkavalier ' . "
196281	196299	196301	196301	Cheddar	568	" Give me a better one , and I 'll never use ' enchanting ' any more , "
196308	196329	196304	196304	Gracie	304	" I 've always told you there 's a bit too much slapstick in this opera for my refined taste . "
196336	196344	196346	196346	Cheddar	568	" I prefer to call it realism , "
196349	196358	196346	196346	Cheddar	568	" One must remember the period it portrays . "
196359	196376	196377	196377	She	304	" ' Period ' - ' portrays . ' What an artist in alliteration he is ! "
196382	196390	196377	196377	She	304	" ' Portrays . ' Noble word . "
196391	196398	196400	196400	Cheddar	568	" It 's in the dictionary , "
196402	196419	196400	196400	Cheddar	568	" I do n't believe in letting noble words rust there . I take them out - "
196420	196428	196377	196377	She	304	" And give them a rub up . "
196429	196432	196434	196434	Cheddar	568	" Yes , "
196445	196458	196442	196442	Evelyn	290	" They 've got across one another ... Am I the cause ? "
196487	196506	196478	196478	He	568	" I heard it at Naples last . In fact , the only time I have heard it . "
196507	196510	196512	196512	Cheddar	568	" Ah ! "
196514	196525	196526	196526	He	568	" The San Carlo . That must have been wormwood . "
196535	196538	196540	196540	Evelyn	290	" Gall , "
196546	196561	196562	196562	Cheddar	568	" Now take what you call the ' slapstick ' in the last act . "
196804	196826	196827	196827	Gracie	304	" Shall we sit more back for this act ? In this place it 's better to hear than to see , "
196913	196930	196910	196910	Evelyn	290	" I see you 've got ' The Nature of the Physical World ' with you . "
196931	196937	196970	196970	her	304	" You 've read it ? "
196938	196942	196910	196910	Evelyn	290	" Oh yes . "
196943	196953	196970	196970	her	304	" Do n't you think it 's perfectly thrilling ? "
196954	196958	196960	196960	Evelyn	290	" I do , "
196973	196976	196977	196977	she	304	" Only , "
196981	197007	196977	196977	she	304	" these scientists do n't really understand , or they pretend not to . I wonder whether any of them have condescended to read Troward . "
197008	197011	196970	196970	her	304	" Troward ? "
197012	197060	196977	196977	she	304	" There you are ! Of course you 've never heard of him ! I 'm quite used to that . You ought to read his Edinburgh Lectures on Mental Science . I really mean you ought . They 're more exciting than Eddington 's book there . "
197061	197069	197070	197070	Evelyn	290	" And what 's Troward 's line ? "
197081	197087	197088	197088	she	304	" God 's his line , "
197097	197317	197088	197088	she	304	" The divine creative mind . That 's his line . If the divine creative mind is infinite , we are it . You and me , and all those people there . And these chairs and the lights from the chandelier . Everything . No getting away from it . You know the electrons , whirling around . Of course they are n't the purest form of the divine mind , I mean the first original form . But some finer kind of electrons are - that our electrons are made of . Must be . And they 're everywhere and they 're all the same and all perfect and all working together , doing evolution . God is n't imperfect . If you try hard and keep on trying you realise them . I can realise them now and then for half a minute . Then I ca n't , and then I have to begin and try again . But that half minute! ... No , it is n't as much as half a minute . Two seconds , half a second . I tell you - well , I want you to read that book of Troward 's . You 'll be glad afterwards . I know you will . And there 's something else - "
197424	197431	197432	197432	she	6604	" I think I must watch , "
197558	197567	197568	197568	he	6605	" Perhaps this is why we are here , "
198264	198278	198279	198279	Evelyn	290	" Could I make that young man understand the last half - hour ? "
198288	198321	198281	198281	himself	290	" No . Not if all our lives depended on it . But according to her that cap of his is n't a cap . It 's a mass of whirling electrons . "
198359	198373	198374	198374	she	304	" It was the only right moment to leave , was n't it ? "
198377	198394	198395	198395	She	304	" Thanks awfully for not forgetting my things . Give me my bag , will you ? "
198407	198420	198395	198395	She	304	" I 'm simply frightfully hungry . Do you know the Caligula ? "
198421	198426	198428	198428	Evelyn	290	" Not at all , "
198430	198456	198395	198395	She	304	" I 'm told it 's rather good . In the rue des Trois Freres , near the Place Pigalle . Shall we go there ? "
198457	198460	198462	198462	Evelyn	290	" Anywhere , "
198555	198563	198565	198565	Gracie	304	" I 've never been here before , "
198590	198610	198565	198565	Gracie	304	" But I 've heard a good deal about it from French painters and Argentines and things , and - "
198625	198641	198622	198622	her	304	" Well , yes . It 's just about what I expected it to be . "
198658	198667	198650	198650	Evelyn	290	" I suppose everything ought to be seen . "
199075	199089	199091	199091	he	6684	" In that case , monsieur , one will arrange oneself at once . "
199251	199257	199259	199259	Evelyn	290	" As we are here , "
199261	199269	199259	199259	Evelyn	290	" we may as well be here . "
199276	199279	199259	199259	Evelyn	290	" Champagne . "
199280	199285	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199294	199299	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199300	199303	199286	199286	He	6692	" Caviare . "
199304	199309	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199310	199315	199286	199286	He	6692	" With chopped onions . "
199316	199321	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199322	199326	199286	199286	He	6692	" Ham sandwiches . "
199327	199332	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199333	199337	199286	199286	He	6692	" Fresh fruit . "
199338	199343	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199344	199351	199286	199286	He	6692	" Pears , let us say . "
199352	199357	199286	199286	He	6692	" Bien , monsieur . "
199371	199376	199368	199368	Evelyn	290	" I 've ordered . "
199382	199401	199377	199377	She	6701	" I 'm so glad . I hate being asked what I want . Because I never know . "
199402	199410	199411	199411	he	6692	" I guessed what you would like , "
199419	199425	199427	199427	Gracie	304	" It 's very amusing , "
199429	199432	199433	199433	Evelyn	290	" Very , "
199436	199446	199448	199448	Gracie	304	" You 're in one of your distant moods , "
199458	199463	199453	199453	he	6692	" Are n't you ? "
199464	199470	199472	199472	Evelyn	290	" Not in the least , "
199474	199492	199472	199472	Evelyn	290	" But I want you to know that I do n't live in a universe of superlatives . "
199493	199500	199501	199501	she	6703	" I like you for that , "
199547	199598	199544	199544	He	6692	" She lives alone . No one to protect her with common sense . Apparently she knows all manner of strange people ; some of them must have told her to come here , for instance . It 's all wrong . Her father ought to look after her better . "
199683	199686	199687	199687	he	765	" Yes , "
199690	199709	199687	199687	he	765	" It 's a nice question whether they ought to be on the floor or on the walls . "
199729	199735	199736	199736	she	304	" You do n't know , "
199740	199755	199736	199736	she	304	" what I was thinking while they were singing that trio at the Opera . "
199775	199781	199782	199782	Evelyn	290	" I think I do , "
199794	199829	199782	199782	Evelyn	290	" You were thinking that everybody and everything in the theatre was kind of dissolving into those elemental electrons of yours . I ca n't explain quite , but it was somehow like that . "
199847	199853	199854	199854	she	304	" How did you know ? "
199862	199869	199870	199870	he	290	" I was feeling the same , "
199873	199878	199880	199880	Gracie	304	" There you are ! "
200142	200144	200152	200153	Two waiters	1140	" Orcham "
200196	200237	200193	200193	Gracie	304	" Do you know , Evelyn - I want to tell you - I knew when I first met you that morning we were bound to have the same ideas about things . I just knew it . Did you ? "
200329	200338	200339	200339	he	290	" This is marvellous ! She is marvellous ! "
200345	200371	200339	200339	he	290	" We are by ourselves here . Free ! What a night ! I 've never been through anything like it . It is marvellous ! "
200481	200493	200494	200494	Gracie	304	" And there 's something else I want to tell you , "
200508	200593	200494	200494	Gracie	304	" I was frightfully rude to you when you would n't come to my party that night at the Palace . I simply could n't bear you not coming . But all the same I liked you for not coming . Yes , I did . I should have been disappointed if you had come . And I did n't fly off the next morning because I was in a temper with you - you thought that was the reason , did n't you ? "
200594	200601	200602	200602	Evelyn	290	" I 'm not so conceited , "
200605	200612	200613	200613	she	6731	" Do let 's be frank , "
200616	200653	200613	200613	she	6731	" I feel so near to you . You 're always drawing away from me . Remember our dance ? Now honestly , did n't you think I 'd left the Palace because I was vexed ? "
200654	200657	200659	200659	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
200676	200709	200710	200710	Gracie	304	" Well , that was n't the reason . I went off because I was afraid of you ... I know it sounds very odd , but truly that was the reason . "
200716	200921	200710	200710	Gracie	304	" I told you a lie the other day . I did n't come to London on account of my book . I could have fixed that by post . I came because I 'd been thinking about you for weeks and weeks . I felt I was missing you , and it was silly of me to go on missing you . I 'm saying all this because it 's easier for a girl to talk than a man . People think it is n't , but that 's nonsense . I know how men feel - how you feel , I mean . And I went away again because I was afraid of you again . It comes over me . But to - night I 'm not afraid of you . I 'm very close to you . And I need to be close to someone . I 'm a beast . Yes . I am . You can guess lots of things , but you 'll never guess why I was so keen on going with you to that Shaftesbury Express Counter of Mr. Jebson 's . It was because I wanted to see if I could make you jealous . "
200922	200927	200710	200710	Gracie	304	" Me ! Jealous ! "
200928	201263	200710	200710	Gracie	304	" Oh ! I know I did n't make you jealous , darling , though I said all men were . I knew you were n't , without being told . But was n't that walk to the hotel in the rain heavenly ? I got specially frightened of you on that walk . I felt like nobody when I saw your lighted tower from the Duke of York 's Steps . You 're so wonderful with your hotels . Father 's said so again and again . You know , daddy and I do n't see much of each other , but we 're great friends , really . He always says you 're wonderful . I do n't know how you 're so wonderful , but I can feel it . You make me feel it . And I was walking with you in the rain , all wet , and I was nothing . I knew I was nothing . If I had n't known I was nothing I might have stayed on at the Palace for a bit . So I just faded out . I know you think I 'm brilliant , and so I am in a way . But right down in me I 'm nothing . Why should I want to feel near you when I 'm nothing? ... Now do n't speak . Do n't answer . I 'm only telling you all this because I should hate to deceive you any more . I 'm not going to make any excuses for myself ... 'Girls do n't talk as I 'm talking . ' And all that . To hell with girls ! I 'm not girls . I 'm me . That 's all . Pour me out some more champagne , will you ? A girl likes to be looked after . I suppose I am girls . But I 'm me too . Was n't that trio too lovely to bear ? "
201267	201283	201284	201284	He	6732	" You told me not to speak . But I shall speak if I like . "
201287	201305	201284	201284	He	6732	" And I shall say what I like . You 're miraculous . I say no more . "
201385	201398	201381	201381	She	947	" It 's easier for a girl to talk than a man . "
201417	201420	201415	201415	she	947	" nothing . "
201455	201463	201452	201452	he	6732	" Is she in love with me ? "
201650	201659	201647	201647	She	947	" I think I ought to go home . "
201660	201663	201647	201647	She	947	" Now ? "
201670	201674	201675	201675	he	6732	" Very well , "
201690	201694	201684	201684	He	6732	" Just one . "
201695	201700	201701	201701	she	947	" Well , one , "
201811	201822	201823	201823	she	947	" Shall we have just one drink before we go ? "
201842	201873	201839	201839	he	6732	" What next ? And what an anti - climax ! When we 've had the drink we shall have to begin the departure business all over afresh . Nuisance ! "
201903	201908	201909	201909	Evelyn	290	" And the drink ? "
201918	201924	201926	201926	Gracie	304	" Oh ! Your favourite , "
201928	201933	201945	201945	she	947	" What 's that ? "
201934	201938	201939	201939	She	947	" Orange juice . "
201981	201987	201988	201988	she	947	" Deux jus d'orange nature , "
202255	202280	202248	202248	He	6732	" You might tell me just why you 've come to an affair like this . Is it amusing , or is it silly ? "
202281	202286	202287	202287	she	304	" It 's both , "
202290	202342	202287	202287	she	304	" And did n't you say yourself that everything ought to be seen ? I love it because it shows what people really are . I 'm always wanting to know that . I 've enjoyed it . And so have you - so you need n't say you have n't . "
202343	202349	202350	202350	he	6732	" Then I wo n't , "
202354	202364	202365	202365	she	304	" But it is interesting , is n't it ? "
202372	202379	202380	202380	he	6732	" Oh ! It 's interesting , "
202386	202395	202396	202396	She	304	" It teaches you , does n't it ? "
202401	202406	202369	202369	his	6732	" Teaches you what ? "
202407	202415	202396	202396	She	304	" About - well , human nature . "
202416	202423	202369	202369	his	6732	" Some sorts of human nature . "
202424	202433	202434	202434	she	304	" Are n't we all God 's creatures ? "
202564	202569	202571	202571	Gracie	304	" Shall we go ? "
202596	202604	202592	202592	she	304	" I ca n't stand that kind . "
202605	202609	202610	202610	Evelyn	290	" Why not ? "
202613	202622	202610	202610	Evelyn	290	" Are n't we all God 's creatures ? "
202696	202702	202704	202704	Gracie	304	" I 'll drop you , "
202706	202723	202769	202770	The chauffeur	5757	" Oh no ! It 's out of your way . I 'll get a taxi . "
202724	202733	202769	202770	The chauffeur	5757	" It is n't out of my way . "
202737	202763	202769	202770	The chauffeur	5757	" And I do n't care if it is . I 'll drop you . 1 can be home in twenty minutes at the most . "
202764	202768	202769	202770	The chauffeur	5757	" Thank you . "
202818	202824	202815	202815	she	304	" You 're quite right . "
202842	202850	202852	202852	he	5757	" Well , well ! Who knows ? "
202883	202892	202893	202893	he	5757	" It 's my place to do it , "
202995	202999	203000	203000	she	304	" I say , "
203012	203026	203000	203000	she	304	" Where shall you be to - morrow , about lunch - time ? "
203027	203030	203031	203031	he	5757	" Concorde , "
203034	203040	203041	203041	she	304	" I 'll telephone you , "
203047	203052	203053	203053	he	5757	" That 's fine , "
203056	203060	203053	203053	he	5757	" Au revoir . "
203064	203084	203061	203061	He	5757	" I was a perfect boor not to make the first move . However , it 's all right ... "
203116	203122	203123	203123	he	5757	" I am an idiot , "
203911	203914	203902	203902	Evelyn	290	" Ah ! "
203950	203962	203937	203937	Evelyn	290	" I suppose there 's been no telephone message for me ? "
203984	203991	203981	203981	he	6803	" Any telephone message for me ? "
204010	204013	203981	203981	he	6803	" Golden Arrow "
204737	204744	204745	204745	Her	6836	" Is that you , Evelyn ? "
204765	204780	204745	204745	Her	6836	" Speaking . Ca n't you tell my voice ? I can tell yours . "
204788	204802	204785	204785	he	329	" This wo n't do . I must n't use that excited tone . "
204893	204904	204905	204905	Her	6836	" I hope I have n't disturbed you too early . "
204933	204942	204925	204925	her	6836	" I need to be close to someone , "
205038	205059	205060	205060	His	329	" Are you there ? Can you hear ? I said I hope I have n't disturbed you too early . "
205073	205122	205123	205123	He	329	" I beg pardon . No , you certainly have n't disturbed me too early . In fact , you 're about twenty hours late in disturbing me . Did n't you say you 'd ring me up yesterday at lunch - time , or was I dreaming ? "
205143	205149	205150	205150	she	6836	" Yes . I know , "
205153	205159	205150	205150	she	6836	" But I could n't . "
205160	205164	205123	205123	He	329	" Why not ? "
205165	205206	205150	205150	she	6836	" Well . I could n't . And I 've rung you so early this morning because I knew when I awoke I never should ring you if I did n't do it instantly - instantly . So I did . "
205207	205243	205123	205123	He	329	" And you 've just caught me in time . I 'm leaving by the ' Golden Arrow,'and I have to pack and do all sorts of things . And I 'm not up yet . "
205253	205268	205269	205269	she	6836	" Evelyn , you are n't ! You ca n't go to - day ! "
205273	205277	205150	205150	she	6836	" Why not ? "
205278	205284	205290	205290	she	6836	" I must see you . "
205301	205305	205306	205306	he	6840	" Anything wrong ? "
205313	205321	205327	205327	her	6836	" I - I do n't know . "
205330	205363	205327	205327	her	6836	" We must have lunch together . If you must go back home to - night you can take the four o'clock . Surely you can do that for me , Evelyn . "
205370	205377	205378	205378	he	6840	" All right , my dear , "
205382	205385	205386	205386	she	6836	" Listen ! "
205393	205449	205386	205386	she	6836	" You can pack up your things and bring them along with you , and then you can stay with me till it 's time for you to go to the station . You can have my car . Listen ! I 'll come with you to the Gare du Nord and see you off . "
205450	205455	205456	205456	he	6840	" It 's ideal , "
205459	205473	205456	205456	he	6840	" But I would n't agree to being seen off by anybody else . "
205489	205495	205496	205496	she	6842	" You 're teasing me , "
205504	205514	205386	205386	she	6836	" I 'm not ! Now what time lunch ? "
205515	205556	205456	205456	he	6840	" I 'll expect you at twelve o'clock . Noon . Listen . I 'll send the car for you to the Montaigne . Five to twelve . I know I sha n't be fit to be seen till twelve . "
205557	205573	205386	205386	she	6836	" But I ca n't get to St. Cloud in five minutes , can I ? "
205574	205592	205593	205593	She	6842	" Oh ! I 'm not at St. Cloud . I 'm in the Boulevard des Italiens . "
205598	205607	205386	205386	she	6836	" You must have got up frightfully early . "
205608	205616	205386	205386	she	6836	" No . I came here yesterday . "
205617	205623	205386	205386	she	6836	" Is it a hotel ? "
205624	205627	205386	205386	she	6836	" No . "
205628	205636	205386	205386	she	6836	" You 're with friends , eh ? "
205637	205653	205386	205386	she	6836	" N - no . It 's rooms . I had to be in Paris . "
205675	205683	205684	205684	she	6842	" I 'll count on you then , "
205687	205694	205722	205722	he	290	" You may , my dear . "
205845	205862	205839	205839	he	290	" It 's nothing . It 's nothing . She 's a child , after all . "
206046	206050	206085	206085	She	304	" Appartements meublés . "
206122	206125	206127	206127	Gracie	304	" Well ? "
206156	206160	206162	206162	Gracie	304	" C'est ça , "
206175	206181	206182	206182	she	304	" Now we 're here ! "
206192	206201	206202	206202	he	290	" What 's the object of that Baedeker ? "
206215	206351	206212	206212	She	304	" I went out specially to buy it yesterday , and I shall carry it with me everywhere . Just for a sign to myself that I 've climbed out of the rut of being always so correct and rich and knowing the best places , and being superior to common people . That 's why I bought the mackintosh too . I want to be common . I 'm sick of being in the swim - in everything . It 's come over me . I simply had to have a change . If I had n't I do believe I should have - well , I do n't know what ! I think it 's rather romantic to carry a mackintosh and a Baedeker and walk in the rain . Do n't you ? "
206352	206359	206360	206360	Evelyn	290	" I see what you mean , "
206364	206374	206360	206360	Evelyn	290	" You are n't feeling unwell , are you ? "
206375	206388	206502	206502	she	6864	" No . A bit tired , that 's all . Why ? "
206389	206410	206360	206360	Evelyn	290	" Oh , nothing . I had an idea you looked pale ... Well , what 's the next move ? "
206411	206424	206502	206502	she	6864	" The next move is lunch . We must have it early . "
206425	206428	206360	206360	Evelyn	290	" Where ? "
206429	206471	206502	206502	she	6864	" Anywhere . The first rotten little place we see . There 's lots of 'em about . Places you and I have never heard of . I 'm sure they 're great fun . Come along . Quick ! Quick ! "
206517	206526	206527	206527	she	6864	" Now here 's one , for instance , "
206589	206596	206597	206597	she	6864	" It must be up here , "
206829	206853	206804	206812	The plump woman , lively without haste or flurry	6887	" You are n't absolutely compelled to take that table , but on the whole you will be well advised to take it . "
207027	207032	207034	207034	she	6888	" And to drink ? "
207043	207046	207048	207048	Gracie	304	" Beer , "
207095	207100	207087	207087	her	6888	" That pleases you ? "
207101	207104	207106	207106	Gracie	304	" Much , "
207108	207114	207116	207117	the waitress	6888	" So much the better , "
207239	207251	207253	207253	Gracie	304	" You 've never been in a place like this before ? "
207255	207262	207264	207264	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! Have n't I ! "
207348	207355	207357	207357	Evelyn	290	" We 're interfering with business , "
207384	207389	207390	207390	Gracie	304	" I loved it ! "
207395	207398	207399	207399	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
207403	207409	207399	207399	Evelyn	290	" And now what next ? "
207421	207427	207428	207428	she	304	" I 'm still tired , "
207431	207458	207428	207428	she	304	" I expect I 've eaten too much . I did love it . Suppose we go back to my rooms ? It is n't raining . "
207463	207472	207473	207473	Gracie	304	" Is n't it all lovely and vulgar ? "
207490	207498	207500	207500	Evelyn	290	" No exaggeration to call it vulgar , "
207743	207753	207755	207755	Gracie	304	" I adore it because it is so awful , "
207762	207765	207755	207755	Gracie	304	" Why ? "
207766	207822	207891	207891	She	304	" Well , I do n't know . I told you I wanted a change from all that expensive respectability that I 've been imprisoned in all my life . I like to be vulgar and low sometimes . That 's me , you know , and we may as well be honest about it . "
207823	207826	207828	207828	Evelyn	290	" Expensive ! "
207830	207847	207828	207828	Evelyn	290	" You are n't getting this show for two francs a night , I 'm sure . "
207848	207856	207857	207857	she	304	" No , it is n't cheap , "
207862	207890	207857	207857	she	304	" But I do n't mind that . It 's what I wanted . And I found it all by myself . Come and see my bedroom . "
208038	208045	208046	208046	Gracie	304	" The bed 's very comfortable , "
208053	208064	208066	208066	Evelyn	290	" Well , that 's a good mark , anyway , "
208068	208079	208066	208066	Evelyn	290	" Then you stayed here last night , I see . "
208080	208119	208180	208180	she	304	" Considering I rang you from here at eight o'clock this morning , you might have guessed I had n't just got here . Besides , did n't I tell you I 'd only that moment wakened up ? "
208120	208126	208127	208127	he	6923	" Of course you did , "
208130	208142	208127	208127	he	6923	" But I thought you said Tessa could n't be left . "
208143	208148	208149	208149	she	304	" Oh ! Tessa ! "
208153	208179	208180	208180	she	304	" Tessa must stick it for a day or two , like other people ... And you have n't even shaken hands with me yet , "
208392	208401	208402	208402	she	304	" That 's the bathroom and so on , "
208405	208419	208402	208402	she	304	" You can hang your overcoat in there - and powder your nose . "
208449	208453	208454	208454	she	304	" Sit down , "
208479	208484	208485	208485	she	304	" Oh , dear ! "
208488	208495	208485	208485	she	304	" I do feel so tired . "
208496	208504	208505	208505	he	6923	" I thought you were never tired , "
208514	208517	208518	208518	she	304	" Well , "
208526	208584	208518	208518	she	304	" I do get tired sometimes in the afternoon , and then I rest a bit , and then I 'm perfectly all right again . We 're all ups and downs . Women , I mean . I say , would you mind if I went and lay on the bed for a tiny weeny minute ? "
208585	208588	208590	208590	he	6923	" Do , "
208592	208598	208599	208599	She	304	" I think I will . "
208607	208615	208616	208616	She	304	" Here ! You can read this . "
208619	208627	208616	208616	She	304	" The Nature of the Physical World , "
208684	208689	208676	208676	Evelyn	290	" This is rotten . "
208807	208814	208789	208789	He	6923	" Evelyn ! Evelyn ! Evelyn ! "
208815	208818	208819	208819	He	6923	" Coming . "
208839	208842	208833	208833	He	6923	" Yes ? "
208898	208907	208908	208908	she	304	" I think I must have some tea , "
208917	208936	208908	208908	she	304	" Well , there 's some attendance here , I suppose . I 'll ring , shall I ? "
208937	208948	208949	208949	she	304	" Oh yes , there 's attendance of a sort , "
208960	208972	208953	208953	her	304	" Come in . Come in . I sha n't explode . "
208983	209030	208977	208977	He	6923	" But they 'll never be able to make my kind of tea . I 'm going to get up and make it myself . The things are in the bathroom . I never travel without my tea - gadgets . Will you have some too ? "
209031	209038	209039	209039	he	6923	" You stay where you are , "
209048	209055	209039	209039	he	6923	" I 'll make the tea . "
209056	209064	208977	208977	He	6923	" But you ca n't make tea . "
209065	209095	209039	209039	he	6923	" Ca n't I ? You 'll see in a minute . I 've shown more than one person at the Palace exactly how tea ought to be made . "
209096	209114	208977	208977	He	6923	" No . I ca n't have you making tea for me . It 's not decent . "
209115	209123	209124	209124	he	6923	" Please do as I tell you , "
209133	209139	208977	208977	He	6923	" You are a darling . "
209191	209193	209229	209229	his	6923	" metra "
209335	209360	209328	209328	Gracie	304	" You might stick it down here on the bed . There 's plenty of room . And will you mind shutting the door ? "
209361	209364	209366	209366	he	6923	" Lady , "
209392	209413	209414	209414	He	6923	" I was about to do so . But having both hands full of tray - the rest is silence . "
209442	209451	209452	209452	she	304	" I like you when you 're sprightly , "
209455	209463	209452	209452	she	304	" And I like your new suit . "
209464	209471	209472	209472	he	6923	" It 's an old suit , "
209476	209489	209472	209472	he	6923	" Yes , of course . That 's what father always says . "
209490	209498	209499	209499	he	6923	" And while I 'm about it , "
209502	209511	209499	209499	he	6923	" I 'll shut a few more doors . "
209559	209564	209565	209565	she	304	" Will you pour ? "
209568	209573	209574	209574	he	6923	" I shall pour , "
209587	209593	209595	209595	she	304	" I 'm so grateful , "
209647	209655	209656	209656	she	304	" You were quite right , darling , "
209659	209670	209656	209656	she	304	" You can make tea . It 's a gift . "
209677	209680	209622	209622	him	6923	" Another . "
209681	209686	209687	209687	she	304	" No , thanks , "
209690	209707	209687	209687	she	304	" You might put the tray on the floor . It 's only in the way . "
209708	209716	209717	209717	he	6923	" On the table will be better , "
209725	209734	209735	209735	she	304	" Wo n't you sit on the bed ? "
209744	209751	209687	209687	she	304	" Now do you feel better ? "
209752	209760	209761	209761	she	304	" I just want you to listen , "
209768	209905	209761	209761	she	304	" I 've got to tell you something , and I swore to myself I 'd tell you instantly we 'd had tea . All day yesterday I was dying to tell you , but I could n't make up my mind to it . I kept putting it off and putting it off . That 's why I did n't telephone you . And it 's why I was so stiff and awkward with you at lunch . Nervousness . You know - it stops you from being natural . You ca n't be natural and easy when you know you have something awful to do and ca n't bring yourself up to the scratch . It sort of weighs you down . And I 'm so tired . I could n't sleep last night . "
209906	209911	209913	209913	Evelyn	290	" Nor could I , "
209921	209930	209931	209931	She	6950	" Oh , could n't you sleep either ? "
209935	209980	209982	209982	she	6950	" I 'm in a most terrible mess . Terrible . I do n't expect you can help me . But if you ca n't no one else can . I know I ought n't to worry you . Still , when one 's desperate "
209985	209995	209996	209996	She	6950	" as I am . Evelyn , my dear - "
210005	210069	210000	210000	He	6951	" What now ? What 's the scrape she 's in ? It 's an infernal shame the way her father leaves her to take care of herself . She 's incapable of taking care of herself . Look at her now in this place , and me sitting on her bed , and her father not giving a damn where she is ! "
210184	210187	210188	210188	he	6951	" Well ? "
210192	210203	210188	210188	he	6951	" I 'm too fond of you , my dear . "
210233	210249	210228	210228	his	6951	" This is what comes of having anything to do with a hotel - merger ! "
210254	210265	210251	210251	his	6951	" But what is there in me to attract her ? "
210428	210872	210425	210425	She	6950	" When I told you how I 'd been thinking of you for weeks , and how I 'd come to London just to see you , and all that , I was putting it much too mildly . It was far worse than that . One reason why I 've been so keen on taking charge of Tessa was to keep my mind off you . Yes . I may as well admit it . If you had n't happened to catch sight of me at Calais , I should have tried never to see you again . Because I was frightfully depressed in London - I mean about you . The walk in the rain was lovely , and we were near - were n't we ? - only somehow things were very chilly , very chilly . But when we met at Calais like that , I thought that could n't be just accident . I do n't believe in chance , but I do believe in providence - God . Yes , I do . I believe God 's in everything . I could n't get over that meeting . So I rang you up . I had to . And you were so sweet on Friday night - though you were n't a bit sweet on the telephone on Friday afternoon - and then your knowing what I 'd been thinking while they sang that trio , and your thinking the very same - well , that was too much for me , that was ! I might have got over the meeting at Calais , but I could n't get over that . I thought , surely it must mean something . So yesterday I took this flat , and I had n't the pluck to ring you up until this morning . You know , my dear , I 've been rather in hell , still am . I 'm not the tiniest morsel conventional . No ! But there 's something deep in me that says to me a woman ought never to say the things to a man that I 'm saying to you now . It 's against nature ; and nature is n't conventional ; it 's against my nature - part of my nature . Only , however deep you dig into your nature , there 's always a layer that 's deeper . And it was that deeper layer , when I half got down to it , that decided me I ought to speak to you . Must speak , in fact . And - and - then you - "
211570	211598	211599	211599	Her	6955	" Do n't say anything . Do n't answer . I know I 've put you in a frightfully awkward position . I know . I know . "
211606	211647	211599	211599	Her	6955	" Will you draw the curtains , please ? It 's getting dark . I hate these winter afternoons , but I love winter evenings ... Yes , I know I 've made it awkward for you . I know . "
211790	211800	211801	211801	she	6955	" Do n't say anything until to - morrow , "
211804	211826	211801	211801	she	6955	" Say nothing . Nothing ... You're very dignified . But then you always are . I do admire your dignity . "
211830	211842	211827	211827	He	6972	" To - morrow ! ' And my train this afternoon ? "
212349	212359	212360	212360	He	6972	" And did you really not sleep last night ? "
212366	212374	212375	212375	He	6972	" So we were both lying awake . "
212378	212390	212391	212391	she	6955	" Were you glad when I rang you up on Friday ? "
212419	212425	212426	212426	he	6972	" How pale you are ! "
212436	212447	212448	212448	she	6955	" I did n't put any rouge on this morning , "
212451	212472	212448	212448	she	6955	" I did n't want to look well . I wanted to look pale . Was it wrong of me ? "
212478	212481	212475	212475	his	6972	" Sure ? "
212500	212516	212497	212497	She	6955	" I do n't mean I did it to make you think I looked pale - "
212517	212526	212527	212527	he	6972	" But I did think you looked pale , "
212538	212551	212552	212552	she	6955	" I did it because I wanted to look pale for myself , "
212557	212566	212552	212552	she	6955	" And so you noticed I looked pale ? "
212570	212574	212575	212575	She	6955	" Very pale ? "
212579	212583	212575	212575	She	6955	" Rather pale . "
212584	212593	212575	212575	She	6955	" And did you feel sorry for me ? "
212597	212615	212575	212575	She	6955	" Were you sorry for me because you thought I was sort of pining away for you ? "
212616	212619	212575	212575	She	6955	" No . "
212620	212642	212575	212575	She	6955	" I 'm so glad . That would have been awful . I could n't have borne it . Then why ? "
212643	212656	212575	212575	She	6955	" I thought you were unwell . And you looked so tired . "
212657	212677	212575	212575	She	6955	" Did I ? Well . I was tired . But I 'm not tired now . Are you ? "
212678	212683	212575	212575	She	6955	" Not a bit . "
212684	212732	212575	212575	She	6955	" How lovely! ... Darling , tell me all you ever thought about me . I want to know all you ever thought about me . I know I 'm an egotist , so you need n't tell me that . Tell me all the nice things . "
212809	212819	212804	212804	He	6985	" You have n't been very egotistic with Tessa . "
212820	212845	212804	212804	He	6985	" Ah ! But that 's a special kind of thing . That was showing off - to myself . Tell me some more . "
212846	212869	212804	212804	He	6985	" I 'll tell you the finest thing I know about you . I 've never forgotten it and I never shall . "
212870	212873	212874	212874	she	6989	" What ? "
212879	212883	212874	212874	she	6989	" Whisper it . "
212887	212897	212884	212884	He	6985	" Be still and know that I am God . "
212898	212931	212804	212804	He	6985	" But I never said that to you . Quoted it , I mean . I can remember everything I ever said to you - or you said to me . Everything . "
212932	212959	212960	212960	He	6985	" No . But you said it to your father , and he told me . It puzzled your father , but it did impress him . "
212970	212978	212804	212804	He	6985	" But it did n't puzzle you . "
212979	212988	212989	212989	he	6985	" It 's the greatest saying ever said , "
213013	213019	213020	213020	she	6990	" How well you shave ! "
213023	213054	213020	213020	she	6990	" Much better than father . Tell me , you were n't annoyed that morning when I had the nerve to ask you to take me with you to Smithfield ? "
213055	213063	212994	212994	her	6990	" A bit . For a moment . "
213064	213101	213020	213020	she	6990	" Oh ! How honest you are , darling ! I adore you for that . I 'd sooner hear that than something smooth . But did you enjoy the visit - me being with you ? "
213102	213118	212994	212994	her	6990	" Yes I did , as soon as I 'd given myself up to it . "
213119	213157	213020	213020	she	6990	" Would n't you like to read what I wrote about it , in my book . I 've got a carbon of it here . It 's in the middle drawer of the dressing - table . "
213158	213165	212994	212994	her	6990	" Shall I get it now ? "
213172	213193	213195	213195	she	6992	" It must be very uncomfortable for you , on your elbows like this , and your legs all twisted . "
213335	213349	213397	213397	She	6992	" I 'm to read this thing now , eh ? At once ? "
213350	213354	213397	213397	She	6992	" Of course ! "
213355	213367	213397	213397	She	6992	" Shall I go into the other room to read it ? "
213368	213380	213397	213397	She	6992	" No . Stay here . I should be so lonely . "
213381	213396	213397	213397	She	6992	" I ca n't read by those bed - lights , I 'm afraid . "
213436	213444	213445	213445	She	6992	" Now can you see to read ? "
213505	213518	213496	213496	her	6992	" What an ass I was to hesitate for a single second ! "
213567	213571	213572	213572	he	6993	" Look here , "
213575	213631	213572	213572	he	6993	" If you want something to do , you might take away that tea - tray . I 'm sure you 're like me - you hate to see things out of place , especially on the floor . In fact while you 're about it you might do a bit of washing - up . "
213642	213653	213638	213638	She	6992	" But there 's nothing in there to wipe with . "
213654	213667	213740	213740	His	6993	" There 's a million towels or so . I saw them . "
213668	213672	213638	213638	She	6992	" Very well . "
213703	213710	213711	213711	he	6993	" And leave the door open , "
213714	213720	213711	213711	he	6993	" Leave both doors open . "
213721	213725	213683	213683	she	6992	" But why ? "
213726	213739	213711	213711	he	6993	" I want to hear the sound of you washing - up . "
213746	213756	213757	213757	she	6992	" I shall spoil my beautiful dressing - gown , "
213760	213766	213757	213757	she	6992	" Take it off then . "
214079	214154	214076	214076	He	6993	" She has a lovely mind ... Of course . I knew that before . The girl 's a genius ! But is she ? Can I judge ? She may be able to write this , and nothing else . Anyway , she 's a genius in herself , even if she sits idle and does n't do a thing . I 'm a conceited idiot . I 've been condescending to her . "
214165	214177	214159	214159	she	6992	" Have you read it - about the meat - markets ? "
214178	214194	214076	214076	He	6993	" I 've just this moment finished that part , and I 'm going on . "
214195	214198	214159	214159	she	6992	" Well ? "
214199	214215	214076	214076	He	6993	" I think it 's simply wonderful . That 's all - for the present . "
214216	214234	214159	214159	she	6992	" You really mean that ? Be careful of your words . Because I shall believe you . "
214235	214241	214076	214076	He	6993	" I really mean it . "
214242	214248	214249	214249	She	6992	" Oh , my dear ! "
214252	214282	214249	214249	She	6992	" I 'm so relieved . You ca n't tell how happy you make me . I had a sort of idea it might n't be anything after all . "
214283	214292	214076	214076	He	6993	" Well , it is something after all . "
214293	214304	214249	214249	She	6992	" You 're a great reader , are n't you ? "
214305	214326	214076	214076	He	6993	" I 've read a fair amount . But I 've never read anything like this - since Marie Bashkirtseff . "
214327	214332	214249	214249	She	6992	" Who was she ? "
214333	214372	214076	214076	He	6993	" Never heard of her ? No . Of course you would n't have heard of her . She was before your time . But in her time she made a devil of a stir in the world . "
214382	214386	214387	214387	she	7005	" Thank you , "
214404	214413	214414	214414	He	7006	" I 'll tell you some more later . "
214423	214431	214432	214432	she	7005	" But you can leave it now , "
214435	214438	214398	214398	He	7006	" Why ? "
214439	214447	214398	214398	He	7006	" Why ! I want to talk . "
214448	214455	214456	214456	he	7006	" I will not leave it , "
214460	214470	214398	214398	He	7006	" But do n't you want us to talk ? "
214471	214484	214485	214485	He	7006	" I want to listen to you . And this is you . "
214490	214499	214485	214485	He	7006	" Have n't you got anything to do ? "
214500	214505	214398	214398	He	7006	" Yes . Plenty . "
214506	214519	214485	214485	He	7006	" Well , go and do it then . But not here . "
214520	214525	214398	214398	He	7006	" Why not here ? "
214526	214533	214485	214485	He	7006	" Because you 're too exciting . "
214534	214540	214398	214398	He	7006	" Very well , darling , "
214886	214892	214893	214893	she	7005	" How do I look ? "
214931	214937	214938	214938	he	7006	" You 're an artist , "
214941	214947	214948	214948	she	7005	" Say you 're happy , "
214960	214964	214965	214965	His	7006	" I am . "
214970	214984	214985	214985	She	7005	" Well , I see I must n't read any more just now . "
214992	215025	214985	214985	She	7005	" But I sha n't be properly happy till I 've read every word of it . And that 's your fault . I expect you know I 've missed my train . "
215026	215031	214985	214985	She	7005	" You have n't ! "
215032	215041	214985	214985	She	7005	" Let 's guess what time it is . "
215042	215046	215047	215047	she	7005	" Three o'clock , "
215050	215057	214985	214985	She	7005	" I guess five to four . "
215112	215118	215119	215119	he	7006	" What does it matter ? "
215123	215138	215119	215119	he	7006	" I 'd telephoned to London , but I can call them up again - "
215139	215148	215203	215203	She	7022	" And say you 've missed the train . "
215149	215178	215119	215119	he	7006	" Not a bit of it . I 've got my reputation to think of . I never miss trains . I 'll say I 've been kept . "
215179	215185	215186	215186	she	7022	" And so you have ! "
215189	215199	215186	215186	she	7022	" But you 're glad , are n't you ? "
215210	215222	215223	215223	he	7006	" I 'd better telephone to the hotel for a room , "
215226	215230	215231	215231	she	7022	" Not yet , "
215234	215251	215205	215205	her	7022	" All right . Plenty of time . But ought n't you to be getting dressed ? "
215252	215273	215205	215205	her	7022	" Dressed ? I do n't want to waste my time dressing . Sha n't I do as I am ? "
215274	215295	215205	215205	her	7022	" But we shall have to eat , sha n't we ? And I gather we ca n't eat here . "
215296	215304	215305	215305	she	7022	" Of course we can eat here , "
215308	215366	215305	215305	she	7022	" You do n't know your Paris , darling . All we have to do is to telephone , to Larue 's - say . And order what we like . They 'll deliver it here , complete ; and they 'll take away the ruins and remains . I 'll do it now , shall I ? "
215367	215379	215205	215205	her	7022	" ' Do it now ' is a pretty sound motto . "
215380	215386	215305	215305	she	7022	" What would you like ? "
215387	215393	215205	215205	her	7022	" What you 'd like . "
215394	215402	215305	215305	she	7022	" May I order anything I want ? "
215403	215407	215205	215205	her	7022	" You must . "
215434	215440	215441	215441	she	7022	" Tell me what champagne , "
215449	215453	215305	215305	she	7022	" Krug 1919 . "
215460	215512	215457	215457	He	7024	" Now where do I stand with her ? I 've kissed her . That kind of a kiss must mean something . What ? What does it mean to her ? Marriage ? I do n't care whether it means marriage or not . No , I do n't care ! "
215689	215696	215686	215686	He	7024	" But this girl is staggering . "
215732	215740	215751	215751	she	7022	" The Nature of the Physical World , "
215866	215871	215872	215872	she	7022	" Do n't move ! "
215875	215887	215872	215872	she	7022	" It 's our dinner . I 'll see to it . "
215961	215968	215969	215969	she	7022	" Oh ! There you are ! "
216024	216047	216048	216048	She	7022	" It 's what 's called a cold collation , except for the soup . Do you know how to open champagne ? "
216074	216093	216058	216058	she	7022	" This can not last . It 's bound to end . It 's too good to last . "
216108	216150	216154	216154	She	7022	" They 've come for the things . I told them nine o'clock . Can it be nine o'clock already ? Now you go back into the bedroom , that 's a good boy . I 'll attend to all this . "
216174	216177	216178	216178	he	7024	" Here ! "
216181	216185	216178	216178	he	7024	" I 'll - "
216186	216198	216199	216199	she	7022	" I 'm the hostess , if you do n't mind , "
216241	216245	216246	216246	she	7022	" Coast clear ! "
216249	216257	216258	216258	She	7022	" How stuffy this central heating is ! "
216264	216267	216268	216268	he	7024	" Well , "
216276	216285	216268	216268	he	7024	" I shall have to be off soon . "
216303	216309	216310	216310	she	7022	" But surely , darling , "
216325	216342	216310	216310	she	7022	" Surely you are n't thinking of leaving me here all by myself to - night . "
217185	217192	217173	217173	he	290	" By God ! By God ! "
217207	217227	217205	217205	He	290	" She is mine ! Incredible ! She is mine ! What about her father ? Curse her father ! "
217242	217255	217239	217239	he	290	" By God ! She knows how to make a man comfortable ! "
217285	217294	217282	217282	He	290	" Lucky I had my luggage with me ! "
217301	217310	217282	217282	He	290	" Had she schemed that luggage business beforehand ? "
217502	217506	217507	217507	he	290	" By Jove ! "
217510	217520	217507	217507	he	290	" I might be recognised here at any moment ! "
218210	218213	218214	218214	She	304	" Darling ! "
218259	218301	218239	218239	She	304	" Darling ! Were you going out ? I 'm so glad you did n't go out without me . Why did n't you wake me when you got up ? I asked you to wake me , did n't I ? "
218323	218327	218328	218328	he	290	" Did you ? "
218352	218358	218381	218381	She	304	" I thought I did . "
218359	218369	218370	218370	he	290	" I should n't have dreamt of waking you , "
218373	218380	218370	218370	he	290	" You looked too lovely asleep . "
218385	218428	218381	218381	She	304	" I 've just this second had a most heavenly idea . Of course we could have petit déjeuner here . It 's not bad either . But let 's go out and have it on the boulevard . At some café . "
218429	218432	218433	218433	he	290	" Fine ! "
218436	218443	218381	218381	She	304	" It 's a beautiful morning . "
218502	218505	218506	218506	he	290	" Well , "
218510	218522	218506	218506	he	290	" I 'm not going out . I 've been out . "
218528	218536	218506	218506	he	290	" she protested , but very lovingly . "
218566	218566	218562	218562	you	580	"
218567	218585	218616	218616	she	580	" Only to buy a paper . Must keep an eye on the world , you know . "
218586	218605	218606	218606	she	580	" Darling , you are funny . Of course you must keep an eye on your funny world , "
218756	218763	218764	218764	she	580	" How enormous you creatures are ! "
218767	218788	218764	218764	she	580	" Still , it shall be my dressing - gown . Do n't you love it on me , dearest ? "
218803	218808	218789	218789	She	580	" How 's that ? "
218809	218819	218820	218820	he	290	" I suppose you 're somewhere inside the thing , "
218823	218847	218820	218820	he	290	" But I do n't quite know where . Oh ! Is that your head peeping out of it ? What a morsel ! "
218920	218926	218927	218927	she	580	" The morning has repented , "
218943	218949	218950	218950	She	580	" Oh ! My God ! "
218965	218968	218969	218969	she	580	" Bath ! "
219095	219098	219101	219101	her	580	" Darling ! "
219105	219110	219101	219101	her	580	" Help ! Help ! "
219153	219176	219183	219183	He	290	" Darling ! Do give me that dark soap from the lavatory - basin . Is it there , or have I - "
219177	219182	219183	219183	He	290	" It 's there . "
219195	219201	219202	219202	she	580	" Let me see you , "
219218	219226	219227	219227	she	580	" What are you hiding from me ? "
219321	219334	219335	219335	He	290	" That 's what I was hiding from you , Mrs. Clever . "
219358	219361	219362	219362	she	580	" Well ? "
219449	219493	219446	219446	he	290	" The odious fact is , that I must leave Paris to - morrow morning . And I 'm most frightfully sick about it . I 'd no idea that the sittings would start so soon . And nobody else had , either . "
219507	219527	219528	219528	she	304	" You need n't worry about the first day , darling , or the first three or four days , "
219547	219647	219648	219648	She	304	" You probably do n't know much about Parliamentary Commissions . I do . Daddy has had to give evidence before them lots of times - well , two or three times - and I 've often heard him furious at their goings - on . He says they generally waste at least a week before they get down to work , and they 'll even adjourn for a week or a fortnight or a month at the first meeting . Believe me , darling , I know ! I 've not lived with daddy for nothing . No ! "
219682	219688	219689	219689	he	7113	" That may be so , "
219695	219710	219689	219689	he	7113	" but all the same I shall have to leave to - morrow morning . "
219969	219980	219981	219981	she	304	" Would you leave me alone here for a Commission ? "
219984	219987	219988	219988	he	7113	" Darling ! "
219991	220015	219988	219988	he	7113	" You do n't know how I hate to do it . Listen . I 'll run along to the Concorde at once . "
220016	220020	219964	219964	She	304	" What for ? "
220021	220067	220068	220068	He	7113	" To telephone to London . I shall get the communication quicker there than here . I ought to have telephoned to the Palace last night that I was n't coming . But I absolutely forgot . They 'll be thinking I died en route . "
220071	220078	220079	220079	she	304	" Do n't joke about dying , "
220090	220118	220079	220079	she	304	" And as for getting the communication , I 'll get that for you better than any hotel . I know a man at the Quai d'Orsay - "
220196	220205	220206	220206	she	304	" What 's your number at the Palace ? "
220238	220249	220250	220250	she	304	" You 'll see how soon you 'll get London ! "
220274	220286	220287	220287	she	304	" You 'll see it 's bound to be all right , "
220332	220342	220343	220343	she	304	" You might turn on some more hot water , "
220346	220353	220343	220343	she	304	" This bath 's nearly cold . "
220417	220426	220412	220412	she	304	" Let me have that , will you ? "
220450	220459	220460	220460	she	304	" I shall lie down for a while , "
220489	220498	220499	220499	she	304	" What did I tell you , darling ! "
220880	220908	220909	220909	Gracie	304	"Concerning the arrangements for lodging the northern hotel - managers . Yes . No . Yes . No . Sixth . Nothing should be higher than Sixth ... "
220916	220923	220924	220924	Gracie	304	"Leave all that to Miss Powler ... "
220995	221002	221003	221003	He	7113	" Au revoir . Au revoir . "
221084	221089	221090	221090	She	304	" Well , darling ? "
221102	221108	221109	221109	he	7113	" It 's all right , "
221112	221119	221120	221120	she	304	" I knew it would be , "
221123	221185	221187	221187	he	7113	" Yes . But not in the way you think . The Chairman of the Commission has caught a chill , and he does n't want them to start without him . It 's all postponed for a week . The journalists did n't hear the news yesterday , so to - day 's papers are a bit behind the times . "
221330	221333	221334	221334	she	304	" Darling , "
221347	221356	221334	221334	she	304	" Breakfast . You must be terribly hungry . "
221357	221361	221362	221362	he	7113	" Not very , "
221387	221393	221394	221394	she	304	" Will you order something ? "
221397	221408	221409	221409	he	7113	" Oh ! Had n't you better order it yourself ? "
221437	221452	221453	221453	She	304	" Ought n't a hotel - keeper to be capable of ordering a breakfast ? "
221529	221534	221535	221535	he	7113	" He certainly ought , "
221539	221548	221535	221535	he	7113	" What will you have , my dear ? "
221549	221556	221557	221557	He	7113	" Oh ! Anything . Tea ? "
221669	221678	221644	221645	The waiter	1350	" Deux thés complets . Bien , monsieur . "
221740	221765	221721	221721	Gracie	304	" Is it there ? You go on with yours , will you , darling ? I 'll be there in half a minute . "
221789	221816	221817	221817	She	304	" You think I shall be two hours over dressing . You 'll see . I can dress as quick as any woman you ever knew . "
221829	221847	221849	221849	she	304	" I think I 'll get my frock on , if you do n't mind , dearest . "
221908	221912	221913	221913	she	304	" Of course , "
221916	221941	221913	221913	she	304	" if it had n't been for that lucky chill , you 'd have simply had to go to London to - morrow morning . "
221942	221946	221947	221947	he	7162	" I should , "
221956	221962	221947	221947	he	7162	" Duty before - love . "
221963	221966	221967	221967	she	304	" Yes , "
222046	222052	222053	222053	she	304	" Now I must fly , "
222057	222070	222053	222053	she	304	" The car 's been waiting I do n't know how long . "
222071	222075	222098	222098	She	304	" Where to ? "
222076	222097	222098	222098	She	304	" To see poor Tessa , of course . I dare n't neglect her . Oh ! damn these gloves ! "
222109	222117	222098	222098	She	304	" What 's the matter with them ? '
222118	222125	222098	222098	She	304	" They 're the wrong ones . "
222126	222133	222134	222134	he	7162	" Give me one of them , "
222137	222141	222098	222098	She	304	" What for ? "
222142	222149	222098	222098	She	304	" Because you 've worn it . "
222185	222195	222196	222196	She	304	" Oh ! Darling ! Is n't that morbid ? "
222211	222218	222206	222206	she	304	" I could n't do that . "
222219	222222	222223	222223	he	7162	" No , "
222231	222243	222223	222223	he	7162	" Of course you could n't . Excuse me one second . "
222346	222381	222383	222383	he	7162	" She should know better than that . One glove is a keepsake . But two are only a pair of gloves . No man ever kept a pair of gloves for a souvenir . "
222419	222430	222412	222412	He	7162	" My character is changing . Why is it changing ? "
222458	222461	222462	222462	she	304	" Well , "
222472	222478	222462	222462	she	304	" I must be off . "
222479	222487	222439	222439	She	304	" Am I to come with you ? "
222488	222503	222462	222462	she	304	" Oh no , darling ! That would n't quite do , would it ? "
222504	222512	222520	222520	she	304	" Why must you go just now ? "
222537	222545	222534	222534	She	304	" Duty before - love , dearest . "
222627	222635	222636	222636	he	7162	" And when shall I see you ? "
222639	222645	222646	222646	She	304	" When I come back . "
222657	222664	222646	222646	She	304	" And when will that be ? "
222665	222671	222646	222646	She	304	" Oh ! Not long . "
222672	222676	222646	222646	She	304	" Two hours ? "
222677	222685	222646	222646	She	304	" At the most , my lion . "
222686	222702	222646	222646	She	304	" And supposing I want to go out , how shall I get in again ? "
222703	222744	222646	222646	She	304	" Sweetest . Here 's the key . Stick it under the mat . If you do n't find it there , ring . I shall be in . If I do n't find it there , I 'll ring - "
223041	223050	223038	223038	He	7162	" Yes , I am really in love . "
223081	223086	223087	223087	she	304	" You poor thing ! "
223094	223105	223087	223087	she	304	" Have you been sitting here ever since I left ? "
223106	223113	223114	223114	he	7162	" Not quite all the time , "
223117	223235	223114	223114	he	7162	" The man came in to do the rooms , so I went out for a walk . I left the key under the mat . When I came back it was still under the mat . The man had n't absolutely removed the dust , but he 'd shifted it about a bit . I waited till you 'd been gone two hours and a half or more , and then I thought I 'd better be getting something to eat . So I stepped over to Larue 's . I had a cold snack there . And I 've just come in again . The key was still under the mat . How 's Tessa ? "
223236	223260	223087	223087	she	304	" She 's quite all right . But she had to be soothed , and I decided to stay and see her eat - "
223261	223268	223114	223114	he	7162	" You have n't eaten anything ? "
223269	223293	223087	223087	she	304	" Oh yes . I ate with her . Then I had to collect some clothes I simply had n't a rag here . "
223294	223302	223303	223303	he	7178	" No . Only a wardrobe full , "
223306	223324	223087	223087	she	304	" And here I am . Sit down , because I want to sit on your knee . "
223325	223361	223087	223087	she	304	" Well , then , take your coat off , and your hat . If you keep them on it 'll make me feel as if you were sitting on my knee in the street . "
223362	223373	223087	223087	she	304	" How right you are ! I was going to . "
223394	223406	223377	223377	she	7179	" You are n't cross with me for being so late ? "
223407	223413	223087	223087	she	304	" Do I look cross ? "
223419	223426	223414	223414	She	7179	" No . You look heavenly . "
223427	223453	223377	223377	she	7179	" Well , I know I do n't look heavenly , but I 'm not the tiniest trifle in the world cross , my dear . "
223743	223759	223738	223738	he	290	" Look here , darling ! All this is lovely , but where are we ? "
223945	223950	223937	223937	he	290	" Where are we ? "
223994	224000	224001	224001	she	7179	" Shall we start out ? "
224004	224017	224001	224001	she	7179	" I vote for the Louvre . It is n't three o'clock . "
224018	224022	224023	224023	he	290	" The Louvre ! "
224026	224034	224001	224001	she	7179	" Not to see the Titian Venus ? "
224035	224043	224001	224001	she	7179	" But the Louvre 's so hackneyed . "
224044	224053	224054	224054	She	7179	" That 's why we must go there . "
224058	224072	224054	224054	She	7179	" Have you forgotten we 're going to be tourists ? What fun ! "
224073	224078	224079	224079	he	290	" The Louvre then ! "
224133	224139	224130	224130	he	290	" Got the car here ? "
224140	224156	224179	224179	she	7179	" Oh no ! Tourists in mackintoshes do n't have cars . They take taxis . "
224157	224167	224168	224168	he	290	" Of course . What was I thinking of ? "
224188	224205	224179	224179	she	7179	" I 'm so glad it looks like rain , for the sake of my mackintosh . "
224239	224244	224245	224245	Gracie	304	" What is it ? "
224254	224263	224264	224264	he	290	" We sha n't go to the Louvre , "
224270	224276	224264	224264	he	290	" Very well , darling , "
224281	224286	224277	224277	she	7179	" Anywhere you please . "
224301	224308	224309	224309	he	290	" It 's closed on Mondays , "
224314	224321	224309	224309	he	290	" We 'd both forgotten that . "
224322	224332	224334	224334	Gracie	304	" I believe you remembered it all the time , "
224374	224390	224362	224362	she	7179	" No , I did n't really believe that . What a tease I am ! "
224402	224414	224396	224396	her	7179	" Well now , what is to be the next move ? "
224415	224421	224422	224422	she	7179	" I 'll tell you , "
224427	224460	224422	224422	she	7179	" But you can turn it down if you do n't like it . I want to buy a frock at Jolie Laitiere . Of course , darling , you hate shopping . "
224461	224466	224467	224467	he	290	" I love it , "
224470	224483	224467	224467	he	290	" When I get the chance . Especially in a big shop . "
224635	224637	224639	224639	Gracie	304	" Arretez "
224658	224679	224650	224650	She	304	" That 's a car that daddy always hires , in front ! I remember the number on its tail . "
224698	224709	224695	224695	Evelyn	290	" Is she mad ? What will she do next ? "
224754	224857	224858	224859	Sir Henry	296	" Here 's Mr. Orcham . I waited three days for weather at Dover ; it was simply frightful , and when I got on the boat he came on board . He looked after me on the train . And now he 's finished his work and I 've made him take an afternoon off . We were going to the Louvre , only it 's closed on Mondays ; so I 'm dragging him off to do some shopping with me , and he has to buy some cigars . You off to London by the four o'clock , daddy ? "
224862	224870	224858	224859	Sir Henry	296	" I thought so from the luggage . "
224902	224911	224913	224914	Sir Henry	296	" And where are you picnicking , child ? "
224916	224925	224926	224928	The two men	1356	" Oh ! At St. Cloud as usual . "
225037	225043	225045	225046	Sir Henry	296	" I say , Evelyn , "
225048	225072	225045	225046	Sir Henry	296	" I suppose you 're at the Montaigne . I shall probably be telephoning to you early tomorrow morning . Say nine o'clock ? "
225103	225128	225099	225099	He	290	" Well , I 'm not quite sure about to - night and to - morrow . I 've nothing else to do here ... "
225129	225137	225138	225139	Sir Henry	296	" Everything all right with old Laugier ? "
225142	225174	225099	225099	He	290	" Quite . Quite . And I had an idea of running up to Brussels to - night . I 've heard of a proposition there that might possibly suit us . "
225175	225178	225099	225099	He	290	" Really ? "
225179	225182	225184	225184	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
225189	225210	225211	225211	He	290	" If he asks me the name of the hotel I 'm done . Ah ! The Splendide would serve . "
225223	225227	225211	225211	He	290	" The Splendide . "
225228	225245	225099	225099	He	290	" Really ! But you 'll be back in London to - morrow evening , Evelyn ? "
225246	225257	225211	225211	He	290	" I might or I might not . It depends . "
225258	225275	225099	225099	He	290	" But the Licensing Commission business . I saw it in the paper to - day . "
225279	225305	225276	225276	Evelyn	290	" Oh well , if that 's so , I sha n't trouble to telephone you to - morrow . It was about the evidence . "
225458	225485	225454	225454	his	296	" I must be off . I 'm not quite sure about my seat in the train . I 'm going to Berlin to - morrow . "
225486	225491	225492	225493	Sir Henry	296	" Films , daddy ? "
225543	225563	225566	225566	herself	304	" Fancy seeing daddy like that ! I could n't not have two words with him , could I ? "
225568	225573	225574	225574	Evelyn	290	" Of course not , "
225577	225593	225574	225574	Evelyn	290	" And you 're very clever . But what 's this about me wanting cigars ? "
225594	225597	225598	225598	she	304	" Oh ! "
225650	225657	225658	225658	Gracie	304	" Deux fois si vous voulez , "
225667	225724	225725	225725	She	304	" I noticed yesterday you had n't any cigars . A man must have cigars . I intend to buy you some . It 's a good bureau , the one under the Grand Hotel is . If it is n't under the Grand Hotel it 's next door . Anyhow he knows where I mean . "
225730	225738	225740	225740	Evelyn	290	" This is the height of hospitality , "
225748	225756	225757	225757	she	304	" And you 're pretty clever too ! "
225761	225769	225757	225757	she	304	" What was the bit about Brussels ? "
225770	225773	225774	225774	he	7189	" Nothing , "
225777	225789	225774	225774	he	7189	" It just occurred to me and I brought it in . "
226341	226348	226349	226349	she	304	" I want the first floor , "
226352	226361	226349	226349	she	304	" It 's more amusing to walk up ... "
226362	226371	226372	226372	Evelyn	290	" You seem to know the geography here , "
226375	226393	226372	226372	Evelyn	290	" No . I 've only been here once - for Tessa . She came with me . "
226464	226468	226445	226457	a plump little black - robed woman of thirty - five or so	7275	" Madame desires ? "
226538	226546	226547	226547	Gracie	304	" Do n't leave me , darling , "
226572	226579	226581	226581	Gracie	304	" No , not that one , "
226583	226590	226581	226581	Gracie	304	" My husband loves not green . "
226591	226596	226598	226599	the saleswoman	7277	" A pink then , "
226601	226606	226607	226607	She	304	" Monsieur loves pink ? "
226622	226629	226630	226630	She	304	" I have a ravishing pink . "
226637	226646	226647	226647	Evelyn	290	" What 's the idea of all this ? "
226661	226667	226651	226651	he	290	" Is it for Tessa ? "
226668	226677	226724	226725	The saleswoman	7277	" Certainly not . It 's for me . "
226678	226681	226651	226651	he	290	" But - "
226682	226686	226687	226687	Gracie	304	" You are sweet "
226694	226723	226687	226687	Gracie	304	" Do n't you see I want to be a tourist ? These things I have on do n't go at all with a mackintosh and a Baedeker . "
226776	226791	226765	226765	she	7277	" That suits madame to a marvel . Is it not so , monsieur ? "
226799	226806	226808	226808	she	304	" I think it will do , "
226810	226817	226808	226808	she	304	" I am pressed for time . "
226818	226822	226823	226824	the saleswoman	7277	" But madame , "
226832	226844	226823	226824	the saleswoman	7277	" These others - they are worth the trouble of essaying . "
226869	226875	226852	226852	she	304	" I will take it . "
226876	226887	226852	226852	she	304	" It needs a quite little touch on the shoulder . "
226888	226893	226895	226895	Gracie	304	" That is nothing , "
226897	226926	226895	226895	Gracie	304	" I do not wish that it should fit too well . I will wear it at once . You can send my old frock to my address . "
226927	226933	226935	226936	the saleswoman	7277	" But certainly , madame , "
226959	226962	226964	226964	she	7277	" That , "
226966	226972	226964	226964	she	7277	" that is high dressmaking . "
226973	226985	226986	226986	Gracie	304	" Now can I try on some cloaks - in here ? "
226989	226996	226946	226946	She	7277	" But with pleasure , madame . "
227032	227038	227040	227040	Gracie	304	" And now a hat , "
227042	227047	227090	227092	The second saleswoman	7294	" Here , madame ? "
227048	227051	227090	227092	The second saleswoman	7294	" Yes . "
227052	227068	227090	227092	The second saleswoman	7294	" Ah ! madame , that will be more difficult . The department of hats - "
227069	227074	227090	227092	The second saleswoman	7294	" I supplicate you . "
227075	227082	227090	227092	The second saleswoman	7294	" It is well , madame . "
227227	227234	227236	227238	the first saleswoman	7290	" Madame can count on it , "
227240	227262	227236	227238	the first saleswoman	7290	" Au revoir , madame . Au revoir , monsieur . Many thanks . To the pleasure of seeing you again . "
227278	227299	227273	227273	Gracie	304	" Is n't it too lovely ? Do n't you adore me like this ? Shall we have tea now ? "
227300	227306	227325	227325	He	7305	" Where , my dear ? "
227307	227317	227273	227273	Gracie	304	" Why ! Here , of course . Upstairs . "
227347	227355	227356	227356	she	304	" Trying - on 's great fun , "
227359	227366	227356	227356	she	304	" But it 's frightfully exhausting . "
227387	227506	227384	227384	He	7305	" Supposing I was seen by someone I knew arming a young woman up these stairs ! They 'd instantly think I 'd brought her to Paris for the week - end - a typist or some girl of that sort , they 'd think - with those clothes she 's wearing now . Whereas if she 'd looked really smart they would n't have thought that , and what 's more , if she 'd been wearing her own tres chic things , I doubt whether I should have taken her arm . Extraordinary how people always think that girls of a lower class than themselves , or a higher , are less moral than they are ! "
227585	227594	227583	227583	Racine	593	" Venus all clinging to her helpless prey . "
227622	227629	227630	227630	Gracie	304	" What are you laughing at ? "
227641	227644	227645	227645	he	7306	" Smiling , "
227649	227654	227638	227638	her	304	" Well , smiling . "
227655	227662	227638	227638	her	304	" Your clothes , my dear . "
227663	227674	227675	227675	she	304	" I 'm so glad you like them , darling ! "
227685	227698	227699	227699	he	7306	" How do you know there 's a restaurant in this place ? "
227707	227714	227638	227638	her	304	" Well , there must be . "
227715	227724	227725	227725	he	7306	" I 'll bet anything there is n't , "
227728	227735	227638	227638	her	304	" And how do you know ? "
227736	227750	227751	227751	he	7306	" I know because I have n't seen a single notice about it , "
227754	227786	227751	227751	he	7306	" They think here that customers come to buy - not to drink tea . And I beg to state that your acquaintance with these big shops is still very imperfect . "
227787	227792	227793	227793	she	304	" Perhaps it is , "
227822	227827	227828	227828	she	304	" You are clever ! "
227843	227848	227849	227849	she	304	" I 'm tired , "
227852	227858	227849	227849	she	304	" Let 's sit down . "
227874	227879	227880	227880	she	304	" Not a chair , "
227883	227888	227889	227889	he	290	" Scores of chairs , "
227913	227920	227921	227921	she	304	" I meant chairs for customers , "
227924	227930	227921	227921	she	304	" They 'll come and complain "
227931	227944	227946	227946	Evelyn	290	" When they do , we 'll deal with the new situation , "
227947	227960	227961	227961	They	7313	" Oh , darling ! I 'm so happy you 're happy . "
227964	227971	227973	227973	Evelyn	290	" There 's one good thing , "
227975	227995	227973	227973	Evelyn	290	" Anglo - Saxons may come here for frocks , but they certainly wo n't come here for furniture . "
227996	228004	227961	227961	They	7313	" What do you mean , darling ? "
228005	228012	227973	227973	Evelyn	290	" I mean we 're safe . "
228252	228262	228263	228263	Evelyn	290	" It 's rather wonderful , I must say , "
228266	228273	228274	228274	Gracie	304	" It makes me feel sad , "
228277	228306	228307	228307	Evelyn	290	" Sad ! Why ? Half a minute ago you seemed to have so much happiness in you you did n't know what to do with it all . "
228314	228423	228274	228274	Gracie	304	" There are too many of us . Women , I mean . And we have to fight . It reminds me of the world , this shop does : too many women , and all fighting for a niche and trying to stretch ten francs into twenty to make the best of themselves . I can see them all naked . I can see into their naked minds , and all their minds are the same . But I have n't seen a happy face . Every face I 've seen is anxious . Do you know what this place is - it 's the Western Front . "
228424	228448	228307	228307	Evelyn	290	" What do you know of the Western Front , my dear ? You are n't old enough to have been a Waac . "
228449	228527	228274	228274	Gracie	304	" Do n't I know ! I 've read ' All Quiet , ' and I 've read ' Not so Quiet . ' Not know the Western Front ! Why ! In a few years , ten , twenty , it 'll be only people as young as I am , and younger , who will know what the Western Front was . And I tell you this is the real Western Front to - day . "
228555	228558	228559	228559	he	7338	" Anyway , "
228568	228736	228737	228737	He	7339	" Anyway , you have n't been trying to make the best of yourself this afternoon . You 've been trying to make the worst of yourself . Only you have n't succeeded . You simply ca n't wear bad clothes as they ought to be worn . You give the show away all the time . You told me the other day - yesterday , was it ? - you wanted to be common . Well , you just ca n't be common . And you 've only half - done the job even this afternoon . Look at your five - guinea shoes , and your stockings , and your gloves , and your bag . And think of your undies . This noble effort of yours to look common is merely pathetic . I 'd give something to have heard what those vendeuses said about it all , after we 'd gone . They must have wondered what on earth you were up to . "
228779	228788	228763	228763	She	7340	" Would you like us to get married ? "
228839	228854	228821	228821	she	7340	" Of course I should like us to marry . You know I should . "
228855	228865	228821	228821	she	7340	" You know , you do n't love me . "
228866	228869	228870	228870	he	7339	" Liar ! "
228874	228886	228821	228821	she	7340	" You do n't know what love is , real love . "
228887	228922	228821	228821	she	7340	" My dear ! My dear ! I undertake to say my ignorance is n't quite as complete as you imagine to yourself you think it is . I 'm a very learned man . "
228923	229061	229062	229062	Evelyn	290	" Evelyn ! Listen ! You see this well . There 's a - a chasm as deep as that between us . Deeper . You think I left you all alone this morning because I was angry with you . It was n't that . I left you so that I could look down that awful big hole by myself . And I could n't bear to look down it . I pretended it was n't there . And I 've been pretending all the afternoon . Because I did want to be nice to you , and I do . But it 's been all pretending . I mean pretending about you , not about me . You 're everything to me , and I have n't tried to hide it . Now have I ? "
229067	229155	229062	229062	Evelyn	290	" But I 'm not everything to you . You 're only trying to make yourself think I 'm everything to you . Because you 're a heavenly kind man . D'you know why I kept you in my flat last night ? D'you think it was because I was so terribly hungry for you ? It was n't that . It was because I just had to find out whether you loved me . I could wait - but I could n't wait to know that - "
229156	229159	228821	228821	she	7340	" But - "
229160	229685	229062	229062	Evelyn	290	" No . Please . Do n't stop me . Let me empty my mind now ; I 've begun . I 've told you before I 'm nothing , nothing at all . And I 've told you I 'm a beast . And so I am . It was only half true what I told you about Saturday . I kept you waiting all day on Saturday partly because I wanted to see how you 'd stand it . And I chose those rooms so that they 'd frighten you off , if you could be frightened off . And I asked you to bring your luggage along so that it should be there all ready if you stayed . And I had the tea - things all ready as well . You noticed there were two cups . And I 've told you about leaving off my rouge . Somehow I could n't help telling you about that , and I was n't really tired yesterday afternoon . But I am to - day . And I did n't ask you to stay the night until the very last thing because I knew how nice and shy you are , and I did n't intend to give you time to hesitate . You had to decide one way or the other at once . And - Oh ! It all sounds frightfully mixed up . But motives are mixed up - especially women 's . Now and then yesterday afternoon and evening I felt like sticking at nothing to keep you . I wo n't go into details - you can think of them without me helping you . But at other times now and then I tried to do nothing that would help you . I tried to play the game , and I did play it . And I went to sleep absolutely sure you did love me . I was happy . And I dreamt happy dreams of you . And I was happy when I woke up this morning , until I saw you in your big overcoat . It was the overcoat that began it . You could n't lie in bed and wait for me to wake up . You were too restless for something outside me . And then the newspaper . Those paragraphs . And what you said then ... I've been happy today too . But I 've been happy in my love , not yours . It is happiness to be in love . But it 's misery as well , if you 're the only one who 's in love . Now you 've heard . I 'm a beast . But I 'm honest . At any rate I 've been honest with you . And I 'm not going to cry , or whine , or anything of the sort . I 'm going to be terribly nice , because it is n't a bit your fault . You deserve I should be nice . No , no ! I shall play the game all the time now . "
229703	229714	229715	229715	he	7344	" One occupies oneself with you , monsieur , madame ? "
229735	229752	229753	229753	She	304	" While essaying your chairs , my husband and I are discussing the matter , monsieur . "
229757	229768	229772	229773	the man	1015	" Perfectly , madame . At your service , madame . "
229815	229829	229811	229811	He	1015	" My dear ! You can only play the game by marrying me . "
229884	229892	229897	229897	She	304	" Her liabilities will exceed her assets . "
229900	229929	229897	229897	She	304	" When you said we were safe here , did you mean you do n't want to be seen with me like this by anybody who knows us ? "
229944	229951	229989	229989	She	304	" I did , my dear . "
229952	229956	229989	229989	She	304	" But why ? "
229957	229988	229989	229989	She	304	" Well , it 's natural , is n't it - in the circumstances ? Do n't you think we have an air? .. People do talk , you know . "
229993	230089	230090	230090	Her	304	" Darling , if you were in love with me as you fancy you are - oh , quite sincerely ! - you simply would n't think of a thing like that . It would n't occur to you , and even if it did , you 'd laugh at it . No , you would n't . You 'd glory in it . I do glory in it . I 'd deliberately go out to be seen by people we know . It would be magnificent , like walking in the wind and rain . "
230098	230161	230162	230162	She	304	" Darling , that 's the chasm between us . You 're afraid of the consequences of love . I 'm not . I want every consequence , and I do n't care , because I 'm in love . You do care . Darling , when you said you must go to London tomorrow - and leave me all by myself - "
230166	230217	230162	230162	She	304	" You 're an artist in your way . I admire you for being an artist - and a great artist . I know women are supposed to be the enemies of art , when they 're in love with the artist . It 's been said hundreds of times . "
230218	230231	230090	230090	Her	304	" And are n't they ? I 'm being frank with you . "
230232	230323	230162	230162	She	304	" A man ought never to be frank with a woman . Not one woman in a thousand can stand it , unless he 's in a temper . And you are n't in a temper . You 're too damnably self - possessed . But I happen to be the one woman . I can stand it . To me your frankness is like eating an olive . It 's the sharp taste of it I adore . You know , astringent . Well , go on being frank . "
230324	230340	230341	230341	Evelyn	290	" You have n't answered my question : are n't women the enemies of art ? "
230400	230742	230397	230397	She	7351	" Of course women are the enemies of art , when they 're in love with the artist . It 's their business to be the enemies of art and of everything else that makes men egotists . Both sexes ca n't be egotistic . If they were , it would be the end of the world , and the death of society . Men are only amateur egotists . Women are professional . It 's their nature , and so it 's right , because the divine mind did it . When you see a woman has got hold of a man , firm , and she 's forcing him to fight for his art , and beating him - it 's the finest , most gorgeous thing you ever could see ! It 's supreme ! It 's God himself , working out his plan , that is ! And when she 's clasping him tight , and he struggles , and he gives up struggling and the artist in him sighs terribly and dies happy in her inflexible arms , and she smiles , that 's God 's smile . It 's a tremendous moment . I 'm telling you ; but I might just as well not tell you . You wo n't understand . Ca n't . No man can . Only women can understand what is the greatest thing in the world . When I hear people say a man has ruined himself for a woman , I laugh . I hug myself . I know of three . There were General Boulanger and Parnell . I 've read nearly everything that 's been written about those two . They thrill me whenever I think of them . They sacrificed everything for women , and the women took it as a matter of course . That 's the spirit . What lives ! What ruin ! It was so lovely , and majestic , and awful , I could cry . But God is awful . "
230782	230790	230779	230779	He	7354	" And she 's clasped me tight , "
230809	230815	230806	230806	He	7354	" And the third one ? "
230821	230824	230818	230818	her	7353	" Leo . "
230825	230828	230806	230806	He	7354	" Leo ? "
230829	230832	230818	230818	her	7353	" Cheddar . "
230833	230838	230806	230806	He	7354	" Oh ! Him . "
230839	230994	230818	230818	her	7353	" Yes . Him . One of God 's errors . Leo chose wrong . Not his fault , I expect . But he did . And he ca n't undo it . But he understands . He 's sacrificed everything for me . Even his greatness . He might have been great , if he had n't met me . He preferred being my victim to being great . Wherever I go he goes . He 's quarrelled with his brother because of me . His character is as splendid as his mind . But I could n't love him . I tell you I could kneel down and crouch on my breasts before him , and wash his feet with my tears , and absolutely implore him to forgive me . But he knows there 's nothing to forgive . He knows it 's no more my fault than it 's his . "
230999	231006	231008	231008	Evelyn	290	" But we have n't finished , "
231016	231041	230818	230818	her	7353	" Yes , we have , and I ca n't bear this place any longer . It 's full of vibrations that scare me . "
231042	231049	231051	231051	Evelyn	290	" That 's the central heating , "
231059	231073	231074	231074	Her	7355	" You can call it by that name if you like , darling . "
231117	231123	231124	231124	she	7355	" Eh bien , monsieur , "
231130	231139	231124	231124	she	7355	" Pour cette salle - a - manger ? "
231140	231148	231172	231173	the floorwalker	7358	" Monsieur and madame have decided themselves ? "
231184	231193	231195	231195	Evelyn	290	" What 's she going to do now ? "
231243	231252	231253	231253	Gracie	304	" There are naturally leaves for the table ? "
231256	231263	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" Yes , madame . Two . "
231264	231271	231198	231198	he	290	" One can buy supplementary chairs ? "
231272	231280	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" But there are six , madame . "
231281	231288	231198	231198	he	290	" But one can buy more ? "
231289	231295	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" But yes , madame . "
231296	231301	231198	231198	he	290	" And another sideboard ? "
231302	231338	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" But yes , madame . But perhaps it would be more simple to buy two suites , madame , if madame 's dining - room is very large , if madame has many guests . "
231339	231345	231347	231347	Gracie	304	" That is an idea ! "
231349	231358	231360	231360	Evelyn	290	" What is she going to do now ? "
231390	231395	231397	231397	Gracie	304	" Payment on delivery , "
231399	231404	231397	231397	Gracie	304	" To - morrow ? "
231405	231410	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" Ah , madame ! "
231421	231448	231412	231415	the dark Latin male	7376	" if madame would give me two more days ! It will be necessary for me to communicate with the factory as to the supplementary chairs . "
231449	231455	231456	231456	She	7373	" Very well , Thursday . "
231491	231503	231488	231488	Evelyn	290	" And the answer to all this furniture riddle , please ? "
231510	231546	231504	231504	She	7373	" A surprise for the landlady of my little hotel . She 's been incredibly kind about Tessa . She 's an angel . And her dining - room furniture is all falling to pieces . "
231585	231592	231579	231579	Evelyn	290	" Chemises de nuit . Occasions . "
231615	231630	231631	231631	he	290	" I do n't very much care for pyjamas for the instruments of God , "
231634	231643	231644	231644	she	304	" Perhaps we might have a few flowers , "
231693	231701	231684	231684	he	290	" See . What 's your number ? "
231702	231711	231712	231712	Gracie	304	" But we are n't going home yet ! "
231715	231726	231684	231684	he	290	" Yes , we are - with all these parcels ! "
231801	231811	231812	231812	he	290	" Wait for me one moment , will you ? "
231951	231968	231970	231970	Evelyn	290	" Now I wonder whether it would be asking you too much to make the tea , "
231982	231992	231993	231993	Gracie	304	" Had n't I better do the flowers first ? "
231996	232001	232003	232003	Evelyn	290	" Men before flowers , "
232005	232037	232003	232003	Evelyn	290	" Organise your energy , my dear . You can see to the flowers while the water is boiling for the tea . And give me your mackintosh , will you ? "
232038	232043	232044	232044	She	7395	" Yes , darling ! "
232144	232150	232137	232137	she	7395	" What are you doing ? "
232151	232157	232137	232137	she	7395	" Attending to my clothes . "
232206	232213	232214	232214	she	7395	" I thought I heard brushing , "
232217	232234	232214	232214	she	7395	" It 's like home . Not my home at home . A nice little home . "
232253	232261	232249	232249	He	290	" Why the towel , my dear ? "
232262	232284	232285	232285	Her	7395	" Flowers , darling . They 're rather messy . I want two vases - three . The water 's on . "
232324	232378	232321	232321	Evelyn	290	" And that 's the girl who made that frightening speech to me in the Jolie Laitiere? .. Like a home , is it , a nice little home ! A disreputable appartement on the boulevard ! And I bet it is n't costing her a penny less than five pounds a night ! "
232511	232517	232518	232518	she	7406	" Tea 's all ready , "
232571	232577	232578	232578	he	290	" I 'll teach her ! "
232720	232730	232732	232732	Gracie	304	" It 's delicious having tea together like this , "
232748	232803	232741	232741	she	304	" You 're a terrible sultan , but you do have ideas . When I think of you lunching all alone and me lunching all alone to - day I feel as if I could weep real tears . I 'm frightfully sorry , darling . Iwas a beast . Call me a beast . "
232808	232826	232804	232804	He	290	" Now do n't be forgiving . I could n't stand it . Call me a beast . "
232827	232830	232832	232832	he	290	" Beast ! "
232856	232898	232840	232840	she	304	" And you 've got more than ideas - you 've got taste . Anyhow in confectionery . This brioche is the finest ever ! Oh ! And I must make quite sure what your taste 's like in something else . "
232942	232949	232950	232950	he	290	" It goes with the frock , "
233009	233016	233017	233017	she	304	" Is n't it too comic ? "
233020	233040	233017	233017	she	304	" And when you think there are millions of girls who would really adore it - and men too ! "
233041	233049	233051	233051	Evelyn	290	" It 's exactly what you deserve , "
233053	233064	233051	233051	Evelyn	290	" And I should like some more tea , please . "
233065	233068	233069	233069	she	304	" Oh ! "
233075	233138	233069	233069	she	304	" Do n't imagine I do n't adore it ! Because I do . So do you . We 're both a bit morbid in our liking for ugliness - when it 's ugly enough . Yes , I admire your morbid taste . Poor Tessa would drop dead if she saw me in this affair ... Your tea ! Your tea ! "
233178	233184	233186	233186	Evelyn	290	" Now we 'll continue , "
233188	233197	233198	233198	she	304	" Oh ! You need n't be afraid , "
233201	233214	233198	233198	she	304	" I shall continue till every one of these cakes is eaten . "
233215	233222	233223	233223	he	7418	" I did n't mean tea , "
233226	233238	233223	233223	he	7418	" I meant we 'd continue about that chasm of yours . "
233244	233281	233239	233239	Gracie	304	" I always like to have everything clear and straight ; and the sooner the better . You 've been upset because I told you I should have to go to London to - morrow morning . "
233282	233290	233223	233223	he	7418	" And leave me here all alone . "
233291	233319	233239	233239	Gracie	304	" Yes . And leave you here all alone . Well , you know , I could n't help it happening like that . Just a chance - "
233320	233334	233335	233335	she	304	" Have n't I said before that I do n't believe in chance ? "
233339	233447	233335	233335	she	304	" And there is n't any chance . How could there be ? It was a sign . Fate meant it , so that I should see what your real feelings were - in time . If it had n't happened like that I might never have known what your real feelings were until it was too late . Now I do know . It makes no difference that you have n't had to go to London after all . I know . And it was n't chance . I 'm not blaming you , darling ! You are you , and you ca n't alter yourself . "
233455	233462	233463	233463	he	7418	" But ca n't you see ? "
233466	233523	233463	233463	he	7418	" Ca n't you see I should n't have gone because I wanted to go ? I should have hated to go . The very thought of going was awful . But I should have had to go . There would n't have been any alternative . It 's best to look facts in the face . "
233524	233528	233538	233538	He	7418	" No alternative ? "
233529	233532	233533	233533	Evelyn	290	" No . "
233545	233571	233538	233538	He	7418	" Of course if I 'd been ill - But so long as I could physically go , I should just have had to go . "
233572	233577	233578	233578	she	304	" What about morally ? "
233581	233584	233538	233538	He	7418	" Morally ? "
233585	233605	233538	233538	He	7418	" Yes . You said ' physically . ' Is physically more important than morally ? In your opinion ? "
233609	233612	233613	233613	he	7418	" No , "
233616	233633	233613	233613	he	7418	" Instead of ' physically ' I ought to have said ' physically and morally . ' "
233634	233645	233538	233538	He	7418	" So you think you were morally able to go ? "
233646	233667	233613	233613	he	7418	" I think I should have been morally compelled to go , Mrs. Counsel - for - the - Prosecution . "
233668	233671	233672	233672	she	304	" Well , "
233675	233716	233672	233672	she	304	" If this is cross - examining , it 's only because I 'm trying to get . everything ' absolutely clear and straight ' - for you and for me too . That was what you said you wanted . "
233717	233720	233721	233721	he	7418	" Quite ! "
233724	233738	233613	233613	he	7418	" This licensing business is the most important thing on earth for you . "
233739	233744	233745	233745	he	7418	" Not at all , "
233750	233796	233745	233745	he	7418	" The most important thing on earth to me is to keep my word , my engagements . You see , I 'm indispensable to the case for Reform . I put the case together . And I 'm the engine that drives it forward . "
233797	233894	233613	233613	he	7418	" So that if you did happen to be in for a serious illness , the campaign would fail . There 's nobody to take your place . You 've taught no one else the job . You 've deliberately kept yourself indispensable . You 're the director of the finest hotel in the world , it runs perfectly so long as you 're in charge , but you do n't believe in the maxim that a director ought as quickly as he can to teach the people he directs how to carry on without him . "
233897	233901	233903	233903	Evelyn	290	" See here ! "
233905	233916	233903	233903	Evelyn	290	" Where did you pick up these notions about organisation ? "
233917	233920	233921	233921	she	7419	" Daddy , "
233924	233956	233957	233957	she	7419	" Daddy always says that a boss who is indispensable is a rotten organiser and a rotten boss . He used to take that line sometimes about my housekeeping . Darling ! "
233963	234187	233957	233957	she	7419	" You need n't answer . I do n't want to catch you out . I 'll admit that now and then a man may really be indispensable , and if he does n't stay on the spot everything falls to pieces . Here , for instance . Here you are indispensable . No one can take your place here . You 're so indispensable that nobody could possibly be more indispensable . All this hotel and licensing business and so on is only machinery for living . Here it 's a question of living itself . It 's more vital than any machinery could ever even begin to be . I daresay it 's most frightfully important that customers in your restaurants should be able to get champagne and whisky every night till 2 a.m. instead of 11 p.m. Still , champagne and whisky are only helps to living . Sort of preliminaries to being properly alive . But here , you and I have got past preliminaries . We 're living . Or we were living , until you came in this morning and told me while I was in my bath that you must stop living - and me too - because you had to rush off to London to argue with M.P. 's and things about whisky and champagne . "
234188	234198	234351	234351	his	7421	" Is that quite the way to put it ? "
234199	234283	234284	234284	She	7420	" It 's the only way I can put it , darling . And any other way would be merely the voice of common sense . You wo n't tell me that you do n't know that common sense is not the law of laws . If you tell me that , I tell you you just do n't know the first word about living . Jesus Christ never said anything about common sense ... Darling ! Please do n't fidget your legs . "
234307	234310	234300	234300	her	7420	" Darling ! "
234319	234342	234311	234311	Her	7420	" We were divine last night , darling . God was pleased with us . But this morning ... to - day - "
234343	234346	234348	234348	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
234370	234407	234356	234356	he	7421	" And you 're being the professional egotist and doing all you can to cure my egotism . You 're trying to make me ruin myself , and you call it working out God 's plan . "
234408	234413	234351	234351	his	7421	" No , no . "
234414	234422	234356	234356	he	7421	" You said so yourself this afternoon . "
234423	234435	234436	234436	she	7420	" But surely you can see I was exaggerating , then ! "
234439	234611	234612	234612	She	7422	" I 'm always ready to compromise ... If only you 'd given us a few days , a week . You could easily have arranged that , with all your cleverness . But no ! We were in heaven last night . And this morning , the very next day , when I 'm lying in my bath in front of you , you smash our heaven to pieces . You could n't keep your whisky and champagne waiting . Not an hour ! As I said , I do n't blame you . It 's myself I blame . I was mistaken , not you . I laid a bet , and my stake was everything I had . And I 've lost . You understand love in one way , and I understand it in another . But I can only live with a man who understands love in my way . I do n't say my way 's right . But it 's my way . Darling ! "
234616	234658	234659	234659	She	7422	" I do love you . You ca n't guess how much . And you love me - in your way . But your way would kill me . No . That 's not fair . I should be killing myself . "
234664	234673	234659	234659	She	7422	" That 's a good - bye kiss . "
234681	234694	234695	234695	He	7423	" And I suppose that 's what she calls playing the game ! "
234699	234743	234695	234695	He	7423	" My way ! My way ! But that first night at the Palace , when I refused to go to your party because I had work to do and you got angry , you told me afterwards you liked me for refusing . "
234751	234765	234744	234744	She	7422	" That was different . You were n't in love with me then . "
234868	234875	234876	234876	he	7423	" I 'll answer the door , "
234882	234893	234895	234895	she	7425	" You 'll do nothing of the kind , thanks , "
234901	234910	234911	234911	he	7423	" What reason has she to be irritated ? "
234960	234963	234964	234964	he	7423	" Hello ! "
234968	234973	234964	234964	he	7423	" What 's that ? "
234974	234984	234986	234986	Gracie	304	" My old things , from the Jolie Laitiere , "
234988	234998	234986	234986	Gracie	304	" They 're pretty quick , are n't they ? "
235160	235166	235167	235167	he	7423	" What are you doing ? "
235189	235198	235199	235199	she	304	" I 'm putting on my own things , "
235223	235227	235199	235199	she	304	" But why ? "
235228	235234	235235	235235	she	304	" That game is finished , "
235238	235254	235235	235235	she	304	" I do n't feel like being dowdy any more . It 's no fun . "
235307	235318	235319	235319	he	7423	" I think I 'll try one of your cigars , "
235341	235350	235351	235351	he	7423	" This situation has got to be handled , "
235368	235374	235375	235375	she	304	" What a heavenly smell ! "
235384	235391	235392	235392	he	7423	" Your scent or my cigar ? "
235399	235403	235375	235375	she	304	" Your cigar . "
235404	235427	235379	235379	She	304	" Yes , it 's what I call a pretty good cigar . Now , my child , I want you to - "
235428	235443	235444	235444	she	304	" I 'm not so much of a child as you think I am , "
235448	235455	235456	235456	he	7423	" Now , my dear girl , "
235460	235543	235456	235456	he	7423	" I 'm going to ask you to do something for me . I want you to do it to please me . Take that frock off and put on the other one . I love to see you in it . You invented a most amusing game . Do keep it up . It 's great and original fun . Do oblige me . I should feel frightfully gloomy if you would n't play any more . It would spoil everything . "
235578	235599	235600	235600	Her	304	" No , thanks . I 've changed now , and I 'm not going to waste this scent either . "
235625	235692	235617	235617	Evelyn	290	" Only a few minutes since she was sitting on my knee , and hanging round my neck , and kissing me , and saying how she loved me . And now she 's all altered ! And I 'll swear I have n't said a word , not one word to upset her . On the contrary . What sort of a creature is she ? "
235701	235715	235697	235697	he	7423	" I always thought women liked to dress to please men , and - "
235716	235722	235723	235723	she	304	" You thought wrong then , "
235729	235802	235723	235723	she	304	" Everybody who knows anything at all knows that women dress to please women . I mean , they mind what women think far more than what men think . Men are n't judges . Women are . And if a woman has to choose between pleasing a man she 's fond of and pleasing a woman who hates her , she 'd please the woman every time - in her clothes . "
235803	235811	235866	235866	she	7436	" But even if that 's true ... "
235812	235823	235723	235723	she	304	" Even if it 's true ! It is true ! "
235824	235852	235866	235866	she	7436	" Well , let it be true . You knew it before you started the game , and you did n't care . Why have you altered ? "
235853	235858	235859	235859	she	7436	" Listen to me , "
235908	235994	235901	235901	her	7436	" Do you imagine I ca n't read you like the front page of a newspaper ? If you do you 're mistaken . You just made up your mind to come the grand over me . You said to yourself you 'd force me to keep on wearing that dowdy thing . You thought you 'd show me who was the master here . Just because I 've been fool enough to tell you and show you how I 've gone crazy about you . "
235995	236000	236001	236001	he	7439	" Not at all , "
236005	236010	236011	236011	she	7440	" I say yes ! "
236024	236030	236031	236031	he	7439	" Oh , very well ! "
236038	236043	236044	236044	she	7440	" The truth is , "
236051	236109	236044	236044	she	7440	" and you may as well know it , you 're conceited . You were always conceited , and I 've made you more conceited . You show it the whole time ! You simply ca n't move without showing it . You 're taking advantage of me every minute , that 's what you 're doing ! "
236129	236137	236138	236138	he	7439	" Now , come here ! Please ! "
236165	236171	236172	236172	she	7440	" There you are again ! "
236175	236203	236172	236172	she	7440	" I 'm in love with you . So I 'm to be your slave . Finger up , I come . Finger down , I go . "
236215	236225	236226	236226	he	7439	" You say you 're in love with me , "
236234	236252	236226	236226	he	7439	" I believe you are . And I 'm quite sure I 'm in love with you . "
236253	236264	236206	236206	his	7439	" You 're more sure than I am , then . "
236265	236270	236226	236226	he	7439	" But I am ! "
236271	236316	236206	236206	his	7439	" So you say ! But I 'll just ask you one question . This morning , the very next day after you 'd made love to me , you were ready to leave me because of something you 'd seen in a newspaper . "
236317	236320	236226	236226	he	7439	" Well ? "
236321	236344	236206	236206	his	7439	" Supposing they telephoned to you to - night that you were wanted in London to - morrow , should you go ? "
236349	236352	236345	236345	He	7441	" Yes . "
236353	236357	236358	236358	she	7442	" Of course ! "
236361	236466	236358	236358	she	7442	" And after all that explanation I gave you this afternoon ! Of course you 'd go . And glad to . Men soon get tired of a girl who 's been fool enough to let out that she 's in love with them ! I 've heard that from lots of girls , and mothers too . But you just do n't know what love is . You take everything for granted . Men generally do . And you 're worse than most . I 'm an idiot , but I 'd sooner be an idiot than a conceited ass like you are ! "
236489	236497	236498	236498	Evelyn	290	" Oh , if that 's it ! "
236501	236513	236514	236514	He	7443	" If that 's it , I 'd better be off . "
236523	236529	236530	236530	she	7442	" Yes , you had ! "
236535	236612	236613	236613	He	7443	" But before I do go , I 'll tell you what I think of those explanations of yours . How they struck me . Silly . Absolutely silly . There you were , choosing your words , and thinking you were being so damned eloquent , and feeling conceited about your book because I 'd praised it . And your explanations were perfect bosh . All over the place ! All over the damn place ! "
236642	236753	236754	236754	He	7443	" Not an argument in the whole blooming performance that could n't be riddled to pieces by any man who took the trouble to argue . Not that anything you said was worth an argument ! You the author of that book ! You must be if you say so . But do n't you forget that I read it under your influence . You looked after that all right , did n't you ? You managed to lie on the floor and watch me read it , did n't you ? But I wonder what I should think of it if I were to read it a second time . "
236759	236766	236767	236767	she	7444	" And now you can go ! "
236770	236794	236767	236767	she	7444	" I 've listened to you . Most women would have shut you up . But I 'm different . Off you go . "
236865	236871	236872	236872	he	7443	" She 's absolutely awful , "
236881	236885	236872	236872	he	7443	" Of all the "
236888	236894	236872	236872	he	7443	" She must be mad . "
236897	236904	236872	236872	he	7443	" What excuse can there be ? "
236907	236918	236872	236872	he	7443	" I 'm jolly glad I let her have it . "
236921	236929	236872	236872	he	7443	" What an escape ! My God ! "
237053	237067	237050	237050	He	7443	" Seems to me my coat - collar is higher than my overcoat ! "
237182	237212	237179	237179	He	7443	" My character 's changing . I noticed that not long since . I ca n't remember ever losing my temper before . Well , anyway not for ages . "
237216	237278	237167	237167	they	7453	H"tel Bristol . What sort of a new - fangled noisy place was that ? He turned down the avenue Matignon . He was in the avenue des Champs Elysées , majestic and vast and beautiful in the night . An illuminated shop on the south side appeared to be miles away , and full of mysterious magic . He thought : "
237302	237389	237398	237398	he	7454	" Then he felt humiliated because he had lost his temper . He , at his age ! He was no better than she was . Yes , he was better , because she 'd begun it , but he was not enough better . She was magnificent in her defiance . Her nostrils ! Her burning eyes ! Her stance ! Nevertheless an impossible Tartar . She might be a genius , but she was hellish . Imagine her as a wife . You could n't .
237784	237791	237793	237793	Evelyn	290	" Now you must n't cry , "
237802	237812	237793	237793	Evelyn	290	" I do n't like to see you crying . "
237825	237838	237813	237813	He	7454	" I have never been as tender as this before to anybody . "
237851	237873	237840	237840	he	7454	" Well , you may cry for three minutes - not more . And I wo n't look at my watch . "
237932	237940	237927	237927	She	2027	" What ? What did you say ? "
237941	237949	237950	237950	she	2027	" Hanky . My bag . Handkerchief , "
237953	237958	237960	237960	Evelyn	290	" Bag be blowed ! "
238296	238303	238304	238304	Evelyn	290	" You 'd better sit down , "
238585	238593	238594	238594	They	7480	" That frock does not please me . "
238597	238615	238594	238594	They	7480	" That frock does not achieve its aim , which is not directed at me at all . "
238747	238757	238758	238758	she	796	" I suppose I ought to be getting ready , "
238944	238958	238932	238932	her	796	" What time is it ? I think I shall soon be hungry . "
238988	238996	238997	238997	he	7454	" Oh ! It 's not late , "
239025	239032	239023	239023	masters	4499	" What about dinner , darling ? "
239033	239048	239023	239023	masters	4499	" Where would you like to eat ? Here , same as last night ? "
239049	239057	239058	239058	she	796	" If you prefer it , darling , "
239065	239070	239071	239071	he	7454	" Not at all , "
239074	239088	239071	239071	he	7454	" Anywhere you please , my dear . I want you to choose . "
239089	239093	239094	239094	she	796	" A Durand ? "
239097	239110	239071	239071	he	7454	" Have you ever been in a Durand ? I have n't . "
239111	239129	239130	239130	She	796	" No . But I 'm dying to try one . It ought to suit this frock . "
239156	239165	239130	239130	She	796	" They 're awful , are n't they ? "
239166	239171	239173	239173	she	796	" I hope so , "
239175	239183	239184	239184	He	7498	" You are a funny little thing ! "
239188	239194	239195	239195	she	796	" Shall we go now ? "
239201	239208	239232	239233	a child	731	" Is n't it frightfully early ? "
239209	239217	239218	239218	she	796	" Not for cheap tourists like us , "
239221	239227	239218	239218	she	796	" They always dine early . "
239235	239253	239254	239254	He	7498	" Right then ! But are n't your lips a shade too brilliant for a Restaurant Durand ? "
239266	239274	239275	239275	she	796	" I was just thinking of that , "
239279	239287	239288	239288	She	796	" Wait two minutes . Wait here . "
239313	239318	239319	239319	she	796	" Will it do ? "
239322	239327	239305	239305	she	796	" I love it . "
239370	239384	239385	239385	she	796	" I have n't washed my face with water for years and years , "
239388	239410	239411	239411	She	796	" But I could n't do anything with my nails . The stuff would n't come off without too much trouble . "
239418	239427	239429	239429	he	7498	" Hide them ! Hide them ! Shocking ! "
239431	239442	239429	239429	he	7498	" Even if you did forget to buy proper gloves . "
239501	239511	239513	239513	Gracie	304	" There are thirty - two Durands in Paris , "
239535	239541	239528	239530	No welcoming official	7507	" Who told you that ? "
239542	239546	239513	239513	Gracie	304	" Uncle Laugier . "
239547	239558	239528	239530	No welcoming official	7507	" You seem to know the old rascal pretty well . "
239559	239581	239513	239513	Gracie	304	" No . But daddy and I have stayed several times at the Concorde , and Laugier is rather a dear . "
239785	239788	239789	239789	he	7517	" Two ? "
239849	239855	239857	239857	Gracie	304	" Do let me order , "
239942	239957	239959	239959	Evelyn	290	" This place is a million times worse than where we had lunch yesterday , "
239961	239968	239970	239970	Gracie	304	" I should just hope so ! "
239972	239997	239970	239970	Gracie	304	" I should have been very disappointed if it had n't been . But have n't I chosen the perfect Durand dinner for you ? "
239998	240015	240016	240016	Evelyn	290	" You 're the kind of girl that gets murdered and nobody can guess the motive , "
240024	240032	240033	240033	she	6888	" You 'll have to eat it , "
240037	240045	240047	240047	he	290	" Oh ! I shall eat it , "
240049	240056	240047	240047	he	290	" If I die for it . "
240057	240065	240066	240066	she	6888	" I think it 's all heavenly , "
240072	240111	240066	240066	she	6888	" It was nice of you to let me come here . I shall bring Tessa here now , for a treat . It 's the very place for expectant mothers - I bought Tessa a wedding ring . "
240123	240138	240112	240112	He	290	" Well , there 's one good thing about her - she 's depraved ! "
240215	240220	240222	240222	she	6888	" When you think , "
240224	240255	240222	240222	she	6888	" that in thirty - two Durands at this moment respectable people are eating vermicelli soup ! You know , it 's exactly the same menu in all these places . "
240272	240287	240288	240288	he	290	" What was that you were writing this morning , in my big coat ? "
240291	240301	240302	240302	she	6888	" I think I 'll take my mackintosh off , "
240335	240341	240342	240342	she	6888	" I tore it up , "
240345	240352	240330	240330	he	290	" But what was it about ? "
240353	240367	240418	240418	her	6888	" Oh , nothing ! I 'm not going to write any more . "
240368	240375	240376	240376	he	290	" It was something about me , "
240379	240412	240418	240418	her	6888	" It was n't . You flatter yourself . It was about me . I 've only got one subject . That 's why I 'm not going to write any more . "
240422	240428	240418	240418	her	6888	" I want to work . "
240429	240436	240418	240418	her	6888	" But is n't writing work ? "
240437	240446	240418	240418	her	6888	" Mine is n't . It 's fun . "
240450	240503	240447	240447	He	290	" She 's like all the rest of 'em . Flirting about all over the place . Ca n't stick to anything . She gave up motor - racing . Now she 's giving up writing . But when she 's my wife I 'll put the fear of God into her . "
240515	240521	240418	240418	her	6888	" What sort of work ? "
240522	240534	240535	240535	she	6888	" You see that girl there at the cash - desk , "
240548	240618	240541	240541	her	6888	" Look at her . See those black wristlets to keep her cuffs clean ? You may be sure they 're white linen cuffs to match her open - work collar . See her hair ? She 's not like any other girl in this place - I mean on the staff . See the expression of her face ? No , you ca n't get it from here . "
240619	240626	240628	240628	Evelyn	290	" No . I ca n't , "
240635	240644	240646	240646	Gracie	304	" I noticed her as we came in , "
240648	240659	240541	240541	her	6888	" I did n't . Well , what about her ? "
240660	240691	240541	240541	her	6888	" See how she ca n't move so long as she 's at that desk . Rather like an A.B.C. or a Lyons cash - desk , is n't it ? "
240692	240699	240541	240541	her	6888	" Do you patronise those places ? "
240700	240913	240541	240541	her	6888	" Yes , sometimes . They 're far more interesting than your Palace restaurants , darling . And the tea 's just as good ... And she has to sit on a stool - it is n't a chair . And she has to sit there behind that grill until the last customer has gone . Same for lunch . I expect . She never speaks to anyone unless a customer asks her something . She is n't quite as solitary as a bus - driver in the Strand , but she nearly is . She just sits behind that grill and looks at bills and takes money and gives change . Now that 's the sort of work I want to do . No , you need n't smile . Please do n't smile . It is . I should love the monotony . It would be so restful . She loves it ; I could tell from her face . She can be herself . She has time to be herself . I want to be myself , only I never have time as I live now . That girl 's job is better even than being a nun . It 's nearly as good as being in the grave . "
240930	240945	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" I should like to do that girl 's work for years and years , "
240949	241070	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" Nothing would happen to me . I 'm tired of things happening to me . She 's meek . She has to be . Blessed are the meek . It 's a blessing I 've never had , and I need it . You do n't know how much I need it . I do n't know how much I need it . I do n't know who I am . And I simply must know who I am . Could n't I have a job like that , in one of your hotels ? Not in London . On the Continent . I can talk both French and Italian frightfully well . Do you understand how I feel ? "
241071	241080	241082	241082	Evelyn	290	" Yes , I understand , my dear , "
241084	241096	241082	241082	Evelyn	290	" But are you ready to what I call talk straight ? "
241097	241105	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" Yes . I adore straight talking . "
241106	241110	241111	241111	His	7525	" Truly now ? "
241120	241135	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" Truly . Neither you or anyone else can be too straight for me . "
241138	241319	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" Well , listen , my dear . In the first place , the girl has n't only got to look at bills and take money and give change . She has to enter every bill on a sheet . And when the last customer 's gone she has to add up the sheet , probably several sheets , and wait while somebody else checks the total . And she has to count her cash , and the cash has to agree with the total , and she ca n't go home till it does agree with the total , and if it 's more than the total she does n't pocket the difference - oh no ! But if it 's less than the total she has to find the difference out of her wages . And all the time while she 's taking money and paying it out , that 's what she 's thinking about . She is n't thinking about herself and the mystic beauty of being meek and the virtue of monotony and so on . "
241320	241329	241330	241330	Grace	304	" Darling , you 're laughing at me , "
241337	241342	241343	241343	He	7527	" I 'm not ! "
241350	241375	241343	241343	He	7527	" I 'm perfectly serious and I 'm just talking straight . However , I 'll stop , if you ca n't stand it . "
241376	241436	240946	240946	Gracie	304	" You go on . I 'm sorry . But do you imagine I could n't do the adding - up business and the counting ? Of course I could . I 'm very good at it . As if I had n't kept the house - books at home for daddy . And they 're no joke either . "
241437	241449	241450	241450	he	7527	" I do n't say you are n't good at it , "
241455	241555	241450	241450	he	7527	" But you could n't do it . I mean you could n't keep on doing it . You say you 've kept your father 's house - books . But who 's keeping your father 's house - books now ? Not you . You kept them as long as you felt like keeping them , and then you turned them over to someone else to keep , someone who had to keep them whether she felt like it or not . The moment you did n't feel like it you chucked it . And quite right too ! "
241556	241570	241330	241330	Grace	304	" But I could keep books whether I felt like it or not . "
241571	241731	241450	241450	he	7527	" You 're wrong . You could n't . That 's the whole point . It is n't your fault . You were n't brought up to it . That cash - girl there was brought up to it . She 's always been used to being in a certain place at a certain time , whatever the weather , and whatever she feels like . If she can move her feet , she 's got to arrive on time and stay until she 's finished . She 's been disciplined . It takes years to learn discipline , and you must begin early . You have to begin to learn discipline before you can talk . There 's no other way - that is , if you are to be happy under discipline . That cash - girl has learnt one accomplishment that you 've never learnt and never will , and she took years to learn it . "
241732	241737	241330	241330	Grace	304	" What 's that ? "
241738	241847	241450	241450	he	7527	" She 's learnt to stick it . You 've never learnt that - you 've never had the chance to . You could no more stick it as she sticks it than you could learn to play Beethoven sonatas in public without being laughed off the platform . You think that that girl 's work is easy and you could do it on your head . It is n't , and you could n't . It requires gifts that are beyond you . You 're young , God knows , but if you wanted her qualities you ought to have started out after them twenty years ago . "
241856	241925	241848	241848	He	7528	" I might twit you about throwing up motor - racing and wanting now to throw up writing ; but I wo n't . I 'll spare you that . You 've had all you can swallow . And all this talk is a pure waste of time . I 've got something else in store for you , and right down in your heart you know it . "
241926	241939	241330	241330	Grace	304	" Are n't you being a little hard on me , darling ? "
241940	242032	241848	241848	He	7528	" Hard , my dear ? No . Only straight . A straight line is the nearest way between two points . A line is n't hard . And I 'll tell you another thing . You could n't get a responsible place like that girl has . You just apply , and you 'll see . They 'd ask you quick enough what experience you 'd had , and they 'd ask for your testimonials . And then when you could n't deliver the goods they 'd laugh at you . "
242033	242040	241330	241330	Grace	304	" But everyone has to begin . "
242041	242211	241848	241848	He	7528	" Not at your age , and with your money . Sell all that you have and give to the poor . And make your father do the same , so that he could n't help you when you did n't feel like sticking it ; and you might have a chance . You 'd probably die of the experience , or do something worse , but you 'd have a chance . Oh yes , you could get a place . I could push you into some kind of place , just as you are , if I was an unscrupulous scoundrel . But you 'd only be playing at it , and everybody would know you were only playing at it . I can hear the other girls talking among themselves about you . ' Oh , her ! She 's a scream ! And keeps girls that want a job out of it ! ' You 'd like that , would n't you , my dear ! "
242308	242412	242306	242306	Gracie	304	" Have I driven any of the mysticism out of her ? When was it she was talking about secret Signs with a capital S , and Fate with a capital F ? Oh yes , my seeing the paragraphs in the paper was a mystical sign - that I did n't really love her . ' No such thing as chance ! ' What a world the witch lives in ! And what a sardonic devil I am ! Still , she asked for it . It 's ask and ye shall receive - when I 'm the person that 's asked . "
242448	242493	242427	242427	He	7535	" Darling , how can I argue with you ? I ca n't . You 're too strong for me . You 're ruthless . I do n't say you are n't right . Have n't I told you I 'm nothing - nothing ? "
242494	242500	242502	242502	he	7535	" I 'm not ruthless , "
242507	242516	242502	242502	he	7535	" It 's common sense that 's ruthless . "
242517	242526	242527	242527	she	304	" It does n't seem to help me , "
242530	242538	242527	242527	she	304	" What I always want is encouragement . "
242539	242547	242548	242548	he	7535	" Not encouragement on the wrong path , "
242591	242601	242602	242602	she	304	" Then the right path - what is it ? "
242606	242611	242612	242612	he	7535	" You 're rich , "
242615	242788	242602	242602	she	304	" And you ca n't not be rich . You 've got to go on being rich and spectacular and all that . It 's not a bad thing , really . Has its uses in what political journalists call the fabric of society . We others are entitled to have something to look at . Of course I know you 'll say I 'm talking like a manager of luxury hotels . But I mean it . If I did n't I should n't be what I am . In any case it 's not the slightest use selling all you have and giving to the poor , or trying to do jobs that plain ordinary girls can do ten times better than you ever could . That would only show that you 're afraid of your responsibilities and want to shirk them . That would show you were a coward , and you are n't . We 're all discouraged and discontented and crying out for the moon at times . "
242789	242796	242797	242797	she	7536	" But I must do something ! "
242800	242811	242797	242797	she	7536	" And I was n't brought up to do anything . "
242812	242892	242893	242893	he	7537	" That 's the sins of the fathers . The fathers have eaten what - ever - it - was - sour grapes - and the children 's teeth are set on edge . That 's what you 've got to stick - not sitting at a desk and counting thirty thousand francs a day for a hundred francs a week and your food ... Well , you 've seen through motor - racing and you 've seen through writing "
242903	243090	242893	242893	he	7537	" but there 's Tessa . You 've taken on that responsibility . The baby is n't born yet , and your responsibility there wo n't be done with until either you or both mother and baby are dead . And it 'll need a lot of thinking about . And I shall rely on you not to do anything that will set the child 's teeth on edge . And you 'll have to marry , you know . And your husband will be all you can manage for years . And if you have children you 'll have twenty pretty busy years setting them a good example . The fact is , you wo n't have a moment to spare . And if you do happen to find you have some leisure on your hands , it 'll be up to you to think out some schemes . Nobody else can do that for you . The preacher will now step down from the pulpit . This cutlet ought to be put in the British Museum . Egyptian antiquities . No . Elgin marbles . "
243091	243103	243149	243149	She	7538	" Darling ! I 've never heard you like this before . "
243104	243125	242893	242893	he	7537	" No . You 've thought I was just an ordinary man . You see how mistaken you 've been . "
243126	243135	243149	243149	She	7538	" And so you think I must marry . "
243136	243143	242893	242893	he	7537	" You ca n't avoid it . "
243144	243148	243149	243149	She	7538	" But who ? "
243167	243172	243173	243173	she	7538	" I 'm nothing , "
243176	243186	243187	243187	he	7539	" That 's exactly as it ought to be , "
243190	243201	243202	243202	he	7539	" I 've always sworn to myself I 'd never marry "
243206	243208	243202	243202	he	7539	" again "
243236	243255	243218	243218	she	7538	" but if you 're nothing and I marry you , I sha n't be marrying . See ? "
243274	243305	243271	243271	He	7539	" Her money may be a regular curse to me . On the other hand it may not . Also , her father might go bankrupt , over the films . "
243313	243316	243317	243317	he	7539	" Well , "
243324	243330	243317	243317	he	7539	" I propose we go . "
243331	243334	243271	243271	He	7539	" Where ? "
243335	243343	243317	243317	he	7539	" Any place where we can dine . "
243344	243347	243348	243348	she	7538	" Sweetie ! "
243351	243376	243348	243348	she	7538	" I 'm so sorry you have n't enjoyed it . I 've enjoyed it all . But we ca n't eat another dinner . "
243377	243397	243317	243317	he	7539	" Then I must have some cheese . Let 's order two portions , and I 'll eat both . "
243409	243415	243406	243406	she	7538	" I 'll pay it . "
243416	243419	243348	243348	she	7538	" No . "
243420	243431	243406	243406	she	7538	" But I want to . It 's my dinner . "
243432	243435	243348	243348	she	7538	" No . "
243436	243456	243406	243406	she	7538	" Well then , give me the bill and the money , and let me pay at the desk . "
243474	243485	243486	243486	he	7539	" It is n't good and it is n't cheap , "
243491	243499	243486	243486	he	7539	" And women do n't understand food . "
243595	243600	243602	243602	Gracie	304	" Merci , madame , "
243646	243656	243658	243658	Evelyn	290	" There 's one good thing about this restaurant , "
243671	243675	243664	243664	Gracie	304	" No music . "
243729	243744	243703	243703	Evelyn	290	" Evelyn , you have n't forgotten to telephone to London , have you ? "
243846	243860	243861	243861	he	7539	" Oh ! It does n't matter . There wo n't be anything , "
243900	243934	243885	243885	she	304	" Darling , you know you ought to . You know they have n't got your number and they 'll be expecting you to ring them up . Do be a good boy . "
244008	244011	244012	244012	he	7539	" Woman ! "
244015	244028	244012	244012	he	7539	" What in God 's name have you been doing to yourself ? "
244043	244052	244053	244053	she	304	" I felt positively indecent in that restaurant , "
244056	244065	243999	243999	her	304	" You hid your feelings pretty well then ! "
244066	244116	244029	244029	She	304	" Of course I did ! It was my own fault I went out naked , and I had to stand for it , without making you uncomfortable too . Besides , you were so interesting . Now , darling , you must do your little bit of telephoning . "
244117	244121	244122	244122	he	7539	" Sha n't ! "
244138	244147	244148	244148	she	304	" I 'll get the hotel for you , "
244232	244242	244243	244243	she	304	" They 'll ring you when you 're through , "
244468	244477	244478	244478	She	304	" Evelyn ! What are you thinking of ? "
244486	244520	244478	244478	She	304	" All right ! All right ! Mind my cigar ! I 'm coming . But I wo n't touch the damned telephone until you 've kissed me with your sticky vermilion lips ! "
244605	244621	244602	244602	he	7539	" Very well . I 'll give you a ring about ten in the morning . "
244686	244691	244692	244692	she	304	" You are uproarious ! "
244695	244707	244692	244692	she	304	" Or are you pretending ? Anything exciting at the Palace ? "
244969	244977	245043	245043	He	7539	" You ca n't sleep , darling ! "
244978	244984	244985	244985	he	7539	" I shall , soon , "
245029	245038	245039	245039	she	304	" Something 's gone wrong at the Palace , "
245063	245083	245045	245045	his	7539	" Nothing to speak of . Nothing . What makes you think there 's anything wrong , my dear ? "
245084	245121	245043	245043	He	7539	" You said you 'd ring them up again in the morning . I heard you . And as you do all your hotel - telephoning at night - at least that 's what I understood - "
245122	245187	245045	245045	his	7539	" Now just to show you how mistaken you are , I 'll tell you exactly what I did hear to - night . Ceria - the Grill - room - manager - has n't been seen for two days . And our head - housekeeper is ill - but not seriously . That 's all , and if we never had anything worse - "
245222	245226	245227	245227	he	7564	" Believe me , "
245233	245239	245227	245227	he	7564	" It 's nothing serious . "
245240	245249	245250	245250	she	7565	" But why did n't you tell me ? "
245253	245271	245250	245250	she	7565	" I asked you if there was anything at the hotel , and you shook your head . "
245272	245306	245227	245227	he	7564	" ' Anything exciting , ' you said . Well , there was n't . And I did n't want to spoil your evening with any of those things . Why should I ? "
245307	245379	245250	245250	she	7565	" But I want my evenings to be spoilt by those things . I do n't care whether they 're serious or not . It 's just those things that would make everything so lovely between us . If you keep things from me it means you do n't believe in me being able to take them just right - not too seriously and not too unseriously . Oh , darling ! "
245394	245405	245250	245250	she	7565	" My dear , it was n't that at all . "
245406	245409	245250	245250	she	7565	" Really ? "
245410	245413	245414	245414	He	7566	" Really ! "
245441	245445	245446	245446	she	7565	" That housekeeper , "
245449	245464	245446	245446	she	7565	" Is that the one that came to me when Tessa had the attack ? "
245465	245474	245250	245250	she	7565	" Yes . Miss Powler . Violet Powler . "
245475	245512	245446	245446	she	7565	" Oh ! I know her ! I was only wondering if it was she who was your head - housekeeper at the Palace . You know , her sister used to be daddy 's housekeeper . "
245513	245523	245250	245250	she	7565	" And Violet was too , for a time . "
245524	245571	245572	245572	Gracie	304	" Yes , but I was n't at home much then . She 's splendid . Susan was fine too , but I think I should admire Violet Powler more than Susan if I knew her . I wish I 'd got some of her qualities . "
245583	245605	245575	245575	She	304	" Darling , put your arms round me . We are n't a bit near . And shall we ever be ? "
245621	245626	245627	245627	he	7567	" There , there ! "
245630	245636	245627	245627	he	7567	" You 're only tired . "
245818	245828	245815	245815	He	7567	" I must have gone to sleep after all . "
245950	245969	245947	245947	She	304	" I do like your funny old front teeth . Oh ! How rough your complicated chin is ! "
245970	245973	245974	245974	he	7567	" Here ! "
245977	245997	245974	245974	he	7567	" What 's the meaning of this miracle ? I wake up , and breakfast walks in by magic . "
245998	246001	246002	246002	she	304	" Well , "
246015	246267	246002	246002	she	304	" I got the rolls and butter from the house , but I made the tea myself . I 've been up for ages , and I 'm frightfully well , and I did n't wake you up , did I ? You woke all by your little self . Well , I had the water ready just off the boil , and the tray ready , and as soon as you began to be a bit restless , I made the tea , and here we are . My poor darling , I know you 've had a bad night . I could feel it all the time while I was asleep . I can , you know . But when I woke up you were asleep , and so I simply crept out of bed . I did n't turn on the light . I just took your watch into the bathroom and it was a quarter - past eight . So I got busy then . I dressed in the bathroom . And I must have come in here about ten million times for things , and you never heard me ! But I could hear your breathing . You sleep like a child . If you snored I do n't think I could have borne it . I did want to see you asleep , but of course I could n't in the dark . Now , you comic child , sit up and drink some tea . "
246272	246290	246291	246291	She	7573	" Wait a moment . He must have his mummy 's dressing - gown over his shoulders . "
246298	246306	246308	246308	she	7573	" Oh ! He does look funny ! "
246314	246320	246308	246308	she	7573	" I 've stirred it . "
246321	246329	246308	246308	she	7573	" But I do n't take sugar . "
246330	246343	246308	246308	she	7573	" You will , this morning . Makes a change for you . "
246387	246443	246384	246384	He	7572	" I have n't half appreciated my girl . She 's astounding . I 'll lie in bed for hours and let her do what she likes with me , looking after me . Only women can look after men . They have a way ... No man could do it a quarter as well . "
246469	246485	246487	246487	Gracie	304	" She made his night worse than it would have been - she knows that , "
246489	246508	246487	246487	Gracie	304	" and she 's so sorry . But he knows what she is . How 's the tea ? "
246509	246512	246446	246446	his	7572	" Perfect . "
246513	246531	246487	246487	Gracie	304	" I should have given you chocolate , but I could n't be sure of it here . "
246532	246536	246537	246537	he	7572	" Why chocolate ? "
246540	246556	246557	246557	She	304	" You like chocolate for breakfast when you 're in Paris , do n't you ? "
246572	246575	246576	246576	he	7572	" Sometimes , "
246667	246681	246682	246682	She	304	" Now he can lie down again . Wait a second , though . "
246695	246701	246702	246702	he	7572	" What time is it ? "
246712	246719	246654	246654	She	304	" I 'll get your watch . "
246729	246735	246736	246736	she	304	" A quarter to ten , "
246739	246751	246736	246736	she	304	" I must get London for you , dearest , now . "
246752	246755	246654	246654	She	304	" London ? "
246756	246769	246736	246736	she	304	" You told them you 'd telephone them this morning at ten . "
246770	246791	246654	246654	She	304	" Yes , perhaps I did . But I need n't bother about it until to - night as usual . "
246812	246822	246823	246823	she	304	" I love to see you putting off things , "
246826	246850	246823	246823	she	304	" With all that common sense of yours that always makes me feel so small and silly . It 's such a relief . "
246863	246882	246856	246856	her	304	" All right . We 'll attend to London later ... You're in a heavenly mood this morning . "
246919	246928	246929	246929	he	7572	" You are n't going , are you ? "
246937	246945	246946	246946	She	304	" Only for a minute , darling . "
247201	247206	247207	247207	she	304	" Shall I do ? "
247401	247413	247414	247414	she	304	" I think you might wear the black and white stripe , "
247424	247436	247437	247437	She	304	" Do let me change the studs . Anyhow I will . "
247619	247629	247630	247630	she	304	" I 've got London for you , darling ! "
247639	247642	247643	247643	He	7572	" But - "
247647	247654	247655	247655	she	304	" I thought I 'd better , "
247658	247671	247655	247655	she	304	" When you 've ' phoned we shall know where we are . "
247781	247787	247774	247774	She	304	" Your slippers , darling . "
247846	247849	247850	247850	she	304	" Well ? "
247858	247864	247865	247865	he	7572	" It 's really nothing , "
247869	247877	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" But how is your Miss Powler ? "
247878	247886	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" She does n't seem any better . "
247887	247892	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Is she worse ? "
247893	247899	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" He did n't say , "
247904	247910	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Who did n't say ? "
247911	247914	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Cousin . "
247915	247929	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" And the Grill - room - manager - Ceria , is it ? "
247930	247934	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" No news . "
247935	247948	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Darling , do n't you think you ought to go back ? "
247949	248010	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Certainly not . Why should I ? It 's all in Cousin 's department . It 's nothing to do with me . Is the hotel to stop because one person 's ill and another missing ? It 's up to Cousin to deal with the thing . That 's what he 's paid for , is n't it ? "
248011	248018	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" What did you tell him ? "
248019	248035	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Nothing . I only said I 'd call him up again to - night . "
248036	248050	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Darling , you are n't easy in your mind about it all . "
248051	248095	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" I 'm perfectly easy in my mind . Here one day you 're terribly hurt because I think I ought to leave you , and the next day you 're positiveIy urging me to go . Do you want me to go ? "
248096	248099	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Yes . "
248100	248103	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Why ? "
248104	248123	247900	247900	Evelyn	290	" Because I 'm sure if it was n't for me you would n't dream of not going . "
248177	248186	248187	248187	he	7592	" Well , there 's plenty of time , "
248191	248203	248187	248187	he	7592	" I could n't catch the ' Golden Arrow ' now . "
248204	248208	248209	248209	she	7593	" Why not ? "
248212	248241	248209	248209	she	7593	" You 've got lots of time . It 's only just after half - past ten . I 'll run out to the Wagons - Lits office . "
248242	248250	248251	248251	He	7592	" There wo n't be any seats . "
248266	248272	248273	248273	she	7593	" There 'll be seats , "
248276	248345	248273	248273	she	7593	" Did you ever see the ' Golden Arrow ' full in January ? I never did . Why , when we came over it was half empty . What a good thing I 've put the studs in your shirt for you ! You 'll catch it easily . You go and have your bath and shave off that beard , and I 'll do your packing . "
248351	248393	248346	248346	She	7593	" Darling , I could n't bear to think I was making you slack . I could n't bear it . And if you do n't go , I should know I was making you slack . It would spoil everything . "
248398	248404	248405	248405	he	7592	" But hang it all ! "
248408	248435	248405	248405	he	7592	" I ca n't go off all in a rush in this style . It 's so sudden . And I did have a rotten night . "
248441	248453	248436	248436	She	7593	" I 'll turn on the bath - water for you . "
248454	248463	248436	248436	She	7593	" And I loathe being in a hurry , "
248467	248476	248477	248477	she	7593	" You wo n't be in a hurry , "
248948	248954	248955	248955	she	7593	" I hate this train , "
248965	248973	248955	248955	she	7593	" It 's so pleased with itself . "
248974	248981	248942	248942	she	7593	" But you always take it . "
248982	249027	248955	248955	she	7593	" Yes . But I hate it all the same . I 'd sooner go second - class by the ordinary train and let it be as crowded as it likes . This is so superior and conceited ; it makes you feel ashamed . "
249054	249070	249071	249071	she	7593	" Did n't I tell you , darling , there 'd be plenty of room ? "
249114	249121	249122	249122	she	7593	" This train is awfully stuffy , "
249125	249133	249122	249122	she	7593	" Let 's go out a minute . "
249185	249193	249182	249182	her	7593	" We all know what we are . "
249293	249305	249306	249306	he	7619	" What are you going to do now , my dear ? "
249309	249319	249306	249306	he	7619	" Shall you stay on in that queer flat ? "
249338	249341	249342	249342	she	7593	" Queer ? "
249345	249353	249342	249342	she	7593	" What do you mean , darling ? "
249354	249361	249306	249306	he	7619	" Well , is n't it ? "
249362	249371	249342	249342	she	7593	" I do n't know what you mean . "
249372	249379	249306	249306	he	7619	" Do you call it respectable ? "
249380	249428	249342	249342	she	7593	" It 's just as respectable as any suite in any of your hotels , darling . Do your people ask for marriage - certificates from visitors ? What 's the matter with the flat ? The pictures ? Have you ever been to the Paris Salon ? "
249429	249439	249440	249440	he	7619	" Oh ! I suppose it 's all correct , "
249443	249463	249342	249342	she	7593	" I told the waiter when I took the place that my husband might be coming to join me . "
249464	249469	249342	249342	she	7593	" But the ring ? "
249470	249504	249505	249505	She	7625	" Well , do you imagine if I bought a ring for Tessa I should n't remember to buy one for myself ? Oh , darling ! You are funny , you know ! "
249526	249529	249530	249530	she	7625	" However , "
249534	249580	249530	249530	she	7625	" I shall leave my queer flat this afternoon . I must n't neglect Tessa . She 'll need me more and more now ... Oh ! I remember what you told me in the Durand last night . I remember every word of it . "
249661	249674	249675	249675	she	7625	" I was forgetting you 'd want something to read , darling ! "
249678	249709	249675	249675	she	7625	" You 'd better read . If you read you wo n't worry so much . I do hope you wo n't find things too bad at your wonderful hotel . "
249755	249763	249764	249764	he	889	" My hotel will be all right , "
249771	249786	249764	249764	he	889	" I should n't be surprised if I came back here to - morrow . "
249837	249848	249849	249849	Her	7625	" But , darling , you ca n't do that ! "
249857	249861	249849	249849	Her	7625	" Why not ? "
249862	250127	249849	249849	Her	7625	" You have n't got any excuse for coming back - just yet . Even as it is , do you think your staff are n't talking about you , and wondering why you have n't given them an address , and why you 've been staying on in Paris after your work 's finished ? Nobody ever finds any but one explanation of these things . And if you came , where should you stay ? You would n't come to your own hotels , and you 'd have to leave an address at the Palace , would n't you ? What address then ? You see , you 've always been so respectable - that 's your trouble . When you 've started a bluff you can keep it going for a while , and your respectability helps you . But if you drop it , and then try to start it again - well you 're bound to be done in . If you told them to - morrow morning you had to go back to Paris at once , what would they think ? And if you went off without saying where you were going , what would they think ? Even to explain these two or three days you 'll have to invent a pretty good story . No , darling! .. Isn't it strange how things turn out ? Yesterday morning you were saying you positively must leave Paris to - day - and you are leaving Paris to - day ! Darling , I 'll write you . "
250363	250371	250349	250349	He	290	" Time enough when I get there . "
251039	251050	251051	251051	he	312	" I am an idiot . Where are my wits ? "
251054	251063	251051	251051	he	312	" I ought to have cabled to her . "
251142	251155	251136	251136	he	312	" Arrived safely . I kiss you tenderly . Writing . Your lion "
251247	251277	251236	251236	He	312	" Who is it who 's got that bird - cage on the second floor ? ' he asked Mowlem , with a smile and in a tone artificially light .
251278	251285	251336	251336	Mowlem	312	" Bird - cage , sir ? "
251286	251293	251294	251294	Evelyn	290	" Yes . No . 216 . "
251313	251325	251294	251294	Evelyn	290	" 216 . That 's Lord and Lady Levering , sir . "
251326	251329	251294	251294	Evelyn	290	" Not - "
251330	251335	251336	251336	Mowlem	312	" Yes , sir . "
251347	251359	251341	251341	his	312	" Well , I 'm - ! He has some courage . "
251685	251697	251674	251674	his	7701	" I do n't care a damn for anybody on earth ! "
251713	251718	251698	251698	He	7701	" My car here ? "
251719	251731	251698	251698	He	7701	" Yes , my lord . It 's this minute come . "
251795	251807	251808	251808	Mowlem	312	" His lordship does n't know who you are , sir , "
251818	251824	251826	251826	Evelyn	290	" He will do soon , "
251828	251838	251840	251840	Mowlem	312	" They 've brought their little girl with them , "
251842	251859	251840	251840	Mowlem	312	" She does n't look more than ten or eleven . The image of his lordship . "
251887	251895	251896	251896	he	290	" Anything new as to Mr. Ceria ? "
251926	251941	251923	251923	he	290	" What 's the latest about Miss Powler ? I hope she 's better . "
251942	251965	251923	251923	he	290	" Better ? Oh yes , sir . I hear from Mr. Maxon she went out an hour and a half ago . "
251966	251969	251923	251923	he	290	" Really ! "
252005	252015	252016	252016	he	290	" I shall be back in a few minutes , "
252247	252254	252255	252255	she	468	" Mr. Plimsing is with him , "
252284	252305	252306	252306	Her	468	" Oh ! And Miss Powler is better . She went out this afternoon . We 're all so glad . "
252342	252351	252353	252353	Evelyn	290	" I 'd heard she 's gone out , "
252356	252373	252374	252374	She	468	" Oh ! I beg pardon , Mr. Orcham . I thought you might n't have . "
252380	252387	252388	252388	she	468	" Mr. Orcham , Mr. Cousin , "
252461	252464	252465	252465	he	435	" Well , "
252468	252479	252465	252465	he	435	" Shall we sit ? What 's the latest news ? "
252480	252484	252485	252485	Cousin	334	" About Ceria ? "
252488	252492	252485	252485	Cousin	334	" About anything . "
252493	252507	252465	252465	he	435	" Plimsing has just been telling me . Tell Mr. Orcham , Plimsing . "
252514	252521	252523	252523	Plimsing	435	" The fact is , sir , "
252525	252556	252523	252523	Plimsing	435	" I 've been rather handicapped in my investigations by the fact that Mr. Cousin thought it better not to call the police in - at any rate at present . "
252557	252561	252563	252563	Evelyn	290	" Quite right , "
252565	252594	252511	252511	his	3499	" Yes , sir . I quite agreed . Of course I did mention the disappearance at Scotland Yard , but unofficially . The car has been traced . "
252595	252607	252511	252511	his	3499	" The car ? I never knew Ceria had a car . "
252608	252995	252511	252511	his	3499	" No , sir . Nor did I until yesterday . Either our friend was somewhat secretive or his colleagues here omitted to tell me of it . I heard of it as the result of discreet enquiries in his neighbourhood . The car was found several days ago on the Great North Road , having apparently been run into a milestone and bent its front axle . The accident must have occurred at night . But something went wrong in the identification of the vehicle . Notice of change of ownership had not been given , and the affair was further complicated by Ceria having recently changed his garage and not given his name at the new garage . Extraordinary negligence . His mother and two sisters went off very suddenly to Italy before Christmas ; no one knows why ; they are Italian subjects , sir . Scotland Yard was inclined to think there might be something in that . I reserve my opinion . A false clue may give rise to endless trouble , especially when you have no official standing . No one seemed to know the address of the ladies in Italy - if it was Italy they went to . In the neighbourhood reports were not unanimous . Some said Ceria was in the house , others said not . I must not omit to point out that the family had an Italian maid . She has disappeared . I tried a few likely places in Soho and Clerkenwell , but without result . My difficulty was to get into the house . This would have been easy for the police , but for me it was an illegal act . However , this morning at an early hour , after suitable warning at the Hampstead police - station to keep the officer on the beat out of the way , I did effect an entrance by a lavatory - window at the back of the house . Of course this is very confidential , sir . The electricity was working - I mean it had not been turned off at the main switch . Before leaving I turned it off , as a measure of precaution against unauthorised . intruders . Not that I was authorised myself , sir . "
253006	253015	253016	253016	he	435	" I made an exhaustive search , sir , "
253019	253143	253016	253016	he	435	" Ceria was not in the house . Nothing suspicious . His bed had not been made since he slept in it . But exactly how many days had elapsed since he did sleep in it , I could not conjecture . The dressing - table was very dusty , but not disarranged . The tops of the brushes were as dusty as the table . The comb was missing . There were no letters in the letter - box . There was no food in the kitchen or the larder , except a tin of biscuits , half empty . All the crockery had been washed and put away . One saucepan was dirty . All the blinds and curtains were drawn . "
253721	253748	253718	253718	Evelyn	290	" We do n't seem to have got very far , do we ? Now , Plimsing , have you formed any theory about this disappearance ? "
253749	253759	253700	253701	the detective	3499	" Frankly , no , sir . Not yet . "
253760	253765	253718	253718	Evelyn	290	" None at all ? "
253766	253781	253700	253701	the detective	3499	" Well , sir , I could n't call it a theory . But - "
253782	253795	253796	253796	Evelyn	290	" Well ? You are n't on your oath , my friend , "
253800	253808	253810	253811	the detective	3499	" The whole Ceria family has disappeared , "
253818	253940	253810	253811	the detective	3499	" And the maid has disappeared . All Italians , I beg to point out . The Imperial Palace is a hotel with an international clientele and an international staff . It is a very suitable and likely field for any activity , good or bad , of an international nature . According to what I hear and read in the papers , there is a lot of friction between France and Italy , and all sorts of movements are going on . Two detectives have just been over to the Yard from the Paris Surety , as they call it , and from what I am told confidentially at the Yard , the tales those two men tell - Well ! "
253941	253959	253960	253960	Evelyn	290	" Do you mean to say that Ceria is mixed up in some anti - Fascist plot ? "
253971	254003	253810	253811	the detective	3499	" No , sir . I do n't mean to say any such thing . But people who are busy on some scheme might have reasons for wanting to shift Ceria . "
254004	254010	254012	254012	Evelyn	290	" But this is melodrama , "
254014	254089	254012	254012	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir , it may be . But when a whole family disappears , and a maid , melodrama is what I should call it myself . And it 's along those lines that I should look for a clue There 's been melodrama in this hotel before now , sir . And if you ask me , I do n't know of any big hotel where there has n't been melodrama . "
254095	254155	253810	253811	the detective	3499	" Evelyn admitted ; for he remembered at least two instances , including a manslaughter suspected to be a murder , whose scene had been the Imperial Palace . And Cousin and Plimsing remembered them . The press had been admirably reticent . A new vista of speculation opened in Evelyn 's mind . Why not melodrama ? Melodrama existed .
254156	254165	254222	254222	Evelyn	290	" And there 's another thing , sir . "
254166	254169	253810	253811	the detective	3499	" Yes ? "
254170	254221	254222	254222	Evelyn	290	" I have n't been able to see Miss Powler . Dr. Constam would n't let me . Said she was too ill . Of course I did n't tell him why I wanted to see her . I gave him to understand it might be about some missing saltspoons . "
254289	254293	254294	254295	the detective	3499	" I know , "
254299	254379	254294	254295	the detective	3499	" I know Ceria had been seeing the lady . And what do I find to - day ? She 's supposed to be so ill that I ca n't see her , but I find to - day that she 's gone out of the hotel by herself . She went out by the Queen Anne doors and proceeded into Birdcage Walk , where she took a taxi . It was observed that she was a little lame . "
254396	254402	254380	254380	Cousin	334	" That is her sciatica . "
254403	254405	254407	254407	Evelyn	290	" Sciatica "
254409	254427	254407	254407	Evelyn	290	" Is that what was the matter with her ? I thought you did n't quite know . "
254428	254433	254435	254435	Cousin	334	" I did n't , "
254437	254609	254435	254435	Cousin	334	" until to - day . Constam confessed to me this morning that he had been misleading her and all of us . She had had some symptoms in the umbilical region , and he told her that they might be very serious , and she must stay in bed and keep perfectly quiet for quite a fortnight . But now he tells me that those symptoms were without importance and he knew it . She was really suffering from overstrain , and she was in danger of a complete nervous breakdown . He argued that as women are what they are , a diagnosis of overstrain and danger of a breakdown would not be sufficient to keep her in bed and idle . That was why he put emphasis on the other symptoms . Constam believes that he has no illusions about women . The sciatica is more recent . It began only yesterday , very slightly . She told him that her mother had had sciatica as a girl . "
254668	254710	254661	254661	He	334	" DEAR SIR , I am confined to my bed , and should like to see you about something important . Might I ask you to come up when convenient to yourself . With apologies . Yours obediently , V. POWLER . "
254718	254723	254725	254725	Evelyn	290	" Well , Plimsing , "
254728	254741	254742	254742	He	334	" We shall hear more from you to - morrow , eh ? "
254747	254766	254742	254742	He	334	" How the devil did a fellow with his paunch manage to squeeze through a lavatory - window ? "
254767	254774	254776	254776	Cousin	334	" I may see you later , "
254780	254785	254776	254776	Cousin	334	" Shall we dine ? "
254786	254792	254793	254793	Evelyn	290	" Charmed . Nine o'clock , "
254997	255022	254967	254967	she	7755	" Oh , Mr. Orcham , thank you very much for coming . I 'm so sorry about the chain of authority , but - "
255023	255030	255034	255034	Evelyn	290	" ' Chain of authority ' ? "
255041	255062	254967	254967	she	7755	" You remember you told me that Mr. Cousin was the next above me in the chain , not you . "
255063	255069	255070	255070	he	290	" That 's all right , "
255100	255132	255070	255070	he	290	" I could n't have talked to anyone but you , and it is n't really about the hotel I wished to see you ; and yet of course it is . "
255133	255139	255140	255140	he	290	" That 's all right , "
255143	255154	255140	255140	he	290	" I 'd better sit down , had n't I ? "
255155	255159	255160	255160	She	7755	" Please do . "
255210	255217	255218	255218	he	290	" Sorry to find you ill , "
255238	255248	255249	255249	she	7755	" I 'm not what you 'd call ill , "
255252	255284	255249	255249	she	7755	" in myself . It 's only sciatica . That 's what Dr. Constam says it is . But it was nothing to speak of till I went out this afternoon . "
255285	255292	255218	255218	he	290	" So you 've been out ? "
255293	255304	255249	255249	she	7755	" Yes , sir . I had to go out . "
255305	255316	255218	255218	he	290	" But I hear the doctor ordered you complete rest . "
255317	255378	255249	255249	she	7755	" Oh , that was n't for sciatica . The sciatica only came on two days ago . I must say going out 's made it much worse . I 've sent for Dr. Constam to come and see about it , but he is n't in the hotel just now . He 'll be in some time this evening . "
255379	255387	255218	255218	he	290	" You said you were in bed . "
255388	255435	255249	255249	she	7755	" In my note ? Yes , I have been . And I am going back to bed , but I found I could n't quite manage it . So I lay down here and Beatrice got the eiderdown for me and took my shoes off . "
255448	255456	255218	255218	he	290	" I suppose you 've been overworking . "
255457	255477	255218	255218	he	290	" Oh no , sir . But when Dr. Constam told me I must stay in bed I did . "
255478	255494	255495	255495	Evelyn	290	" You have n't been staying in bed much this afternoon , I 'm afraid . "
255500	255530	255531	255531	She	339	" It 's like this , Mr. Orcham . I had a letter from Mr. Ceria , and I felt I ought to go and see him at once . "
255559	255562	255563	255563	he	290	" Melodrama ! "
255882	255888	255889	255889	she	7770	" I must tell you , "
255892	255901	255889	255889	she	7770	" Mr. Ceria asked me to marry him . "
255902	255905	255906	255906	Evelyn	290	" Really ! "
255991	256012	256013	256013	She	353	" Yes . Of course , Mr. Orcham , this is very private . I 'm only telling you because - "
256016	256026	255987	255987	Violet	353	" Of course ! But I 'd no idea - "
256027	256146	255987	255987	Violet	353	" I had n't any idea either . Not the least . You know , sir , when Mr. Ceria had that scheme for a special New Year 's Eve evening in the grill - room and it could n't be done , I felt very sorry for him and I expect he - Well ! And he 'd told me all about his mother and sisters one Sunday afternoon . They were away , still are , and I expect he was feeling lonely . And he came up here to see me once or twice about the Floors meals and so on . No one could help liking Mr. Ceria , could they , Mr. Orcham ? "
256147	256156	255987	255987	Violet	353	" No . He 's certainly very likeable . "
256157	256171	255987	255987	Violet	353	" And then one evening he suddenly broke out and - asked me . "
256172	256177	255987	255987	Violet	353	" You were surprised . "
256178	256222	255987	255987	Violet	353	" Yes , I was , until after he 'd done it , and then I was n't surprised . I could see it all then . Oh yes , I could see it plain enough . And really I was frightfully sorry . "
256223	256228	255987	255987	Violet	353	" When was this ? "
256229	256284	255987	255987	Violet	353	" The day you went to Paris , sir . And I think I 'd only seen him four times - I mean to what you 'd call talk to ! And I did think it very strange for a man to propose to somebody after he 's only talked to her four times . "
256285	256288	256290	256290	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
256295	256303	256290	256290	Evelyn	290	" I do n't know about that . "
256448	256457	256445	256445	Violet	353	" Of course I had to disappoint him . "
256458	256462	256463	256463	Evelyn	290	" Of course ! "
256468	256605	256463	256463	Evelyn	290	" I do n't believe they sort of understand English people , Italians do n't . They ca n't . There was a very bad scene then , when I told him I could n't accept him . Not that he did n't believe me . He did . But he was so upset it was terrible . The poor boy quite lost his head . Somehow I managed to keep mine - I do n't know how . Oh ! I need n't tell you how glad I was when I got him out of the room . I did n't know where to look . I 'm afraid I did rather go to pieces when I was by myself . But - excuse me troubling you with all this . I ought n't to . "
256610	256616	256618	256618	Evelyn	290	" You 're in pain , "
256620	256630	256463	256463	Evelyn	290	" No , it 's nothing , thank you . "
256631	256634	256463	256463	Evelyn	290	" Sure ? "
256635	256704	256463	256463	Evelyn	290	" It is n't half as bad as it was when I came in . And if you know just what a thing is , it 's easier to stand it , somehow , a pain . There I am again , going on about myself ! I 've only told you about Mr. Ceria and me so that you can understand why he 's written to me . "
256705	256722	256724	256724	Evelyn	290	" Quite . I quite see . It must have all been very trying for you , "
256731	256743	256729	256729	himself	290	" And she had her worries with the excellent Purkin too ! "
256780	256786	256787	256787	she	7786	" Yes , it was , "
257250	257254	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Tell me , "
257258	257320	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" I do n't understand . When Ceria disappeared and the entire place was disturbed about him , why did n't you inform Mr. Cousin - at any rate give him some hint - that you might be able to throw some light on the mystery ? Mr. Cousin had n't the least notion that you were mixed up in it . "
257321	257331	257332	257332	Violet	353	" I did n't know Mr. Ceria had disappeared , "
257335	257377	257332	257332	Violet	353	" until I got his letter early this afternoon . I never was so surprised in all my life . You see , it was on the same night he disappeared that I had to send for the doctor for myself . "
257378	257393	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Do you mean to say that nobody said anything to you at all ? "
257394	257397	257332	257332	Violet	353	" Nobody ! "
257398	257404	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" It 's very odd ! "
257405	257604	257605	257605	She	7800	" I expect Dr. Constam gave orders to everyone that I was n't to hear a word about hotel business . It was Beatrice who brought me the letter . I did n't want to let on to her , but I did just mention Mr. Ceria after I 'd read the letter ; and then she admitted he was n't here . She looked rather awkward for a minute , I must say . But she ended by telling me the fuss there 'd been . Once she 's started she ca n't be stopped , Beatrice ca n't . She did enjoy telling me . One good thing - she 'd no idea who the letter was from . She thought she was telling me something I simply did n't know anything about . And all the time a lot of it was in the letter I had in my hand . I sent her out of the bedroom and then I dressed as quick as I could and went off , and it was a great chance I was n't seen on this floor . If I had been goodness knows what would have happened ! "
257610	257621	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Did Ceria ask you to go and see him ? "
257622	257627	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir . "
257628	257633	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Up at Hampstead ? "
257634	257684	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Yes , sir . At his house . He said in the letter that he was in dreadful trouble about not turning up for duty here and not writing to Mr. Cousin . So I went - of course . I felt as if I was to blame . "
257685	257689	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" And then ? "
257690	257716	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" He was all alone in the house . His mother and sisters are away in France . He 'd told me that long ago . "
257717	257726	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" But there was a servant - Italian . "
257727	257830	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" Yes . But she has a brother married to an English girl , and this sister - in - law would n't hear of her sleeping in the house while the ladies were away and only Mr. Ceria there . So she slept at her brother 's - he has a café or something in Chelsea . He wrote me that after - after he 'd had that scene with me he went home and took out his little car for a drive to calm himself . He likes driving at night . And he ran the car into a tree - "
257831	257835	257256	257256	Evelyn	290	" A milestone . "
257836	258289	258290	258290	She	7801	" Yes , I believe he did say a milestone , now I come to think of it . It 's my belief the poor man did n't know what he was doing , he was in such a state . He was shaken but he was n't hurt , because he could walk . It seems he walked a long way . I do n't know where the accident happened - it could n't have been anywhere near Hampstead . In the end he came back home to Hampstead . Middle of the night . And the next morning he felt he could n't face the hotel . And he could n't bring himself to telephone . But he did telephone to the maid and told her he was leaving the house until his people came back , and she could take a holiday till he sent word to her again . I do n't know where he went , and I do n't think he quite knows either . And he said that each day he stayed away from the hotel and did n't let them know , the harder it was for him to do as he ought , and so he did n't . He just let things drag on . You can understand it , Mr. Orcham , ca n't you ? Anyhow , I got his letter this afternoon , saying he 'd be at the house all afternoon , and would I come ? He was quite quiet . That made it all the worse . I could n't tell you half he told me , not because there was anything you ought n't to hear . I could n't remember it all , and it was all so mixed up . He looked ill . In fact he was rather changed . You ca n't imagine how he was . He 's terribly afraid of you , Mr. Orcham . I never thought any man could be as upset as he was , though he 's quite made up his mind to take my refusal . If he had n't , I should have walked out of his house . I did n't know what to do with him . I thought I 'd better put his bed straight for him . And he promised me he 'd go out somewhere and have a proper meal . While he was telling me he walked all over the house and I had to follow him . That was how I saw how his bed was . Oh ! You ca n't imagine ... If I had n't seen it I could n't have believed it . "
258456	258462	258464	258464	Evelyn	290	" I am an ass , "
258466	258483	258464	258464	Evelyn	290	" What 's the good of supposing ? I have returned ... And she 's ill . "
258808	258821	258822	258822	Violet	353	" It was n't his fault ! He could n't help it ! "
259068	259371	259048	259049	a woman	9588	" Well , Miss Powler , this is a startler . Out of bed ! Oh ! And you 're dressed too ! I am glad . I 've only a minute , but I thought I 'd dash in and tell you I called at the Laundry this afternoon in my time off as you asked me last night , and I saw Mr. Purkin about those seventy - one pillow - slips . I told him exactly what you said . I assure you my modest female politeness to the great little man was just heavenly , but he was furious , perfectly furious . Some men are very funny . He said he could n't believe his eyes when the lot of them came back to him yesterday . He said they 'd been finished exactly like all the others and there could n't be any mistake , and they were n't rough at all . And to make sure he 'd put one on his own pillow last night and it was absolutely smooth , and if he had n't slept well it was n't because of the pillow - slip , it was because he 'd been so upset . I had all I could do to keep from laughing , but of course I did n't laugh . Can you imagine the gentle creature putting the slip on his pillow himself and laying his dear little precious head on it and then not sleeping ? And him telling me in the most serious way ! And I 'd never seen him before ! Perhaps it was just as well you did n't warn me what you were letting me in for . If you had I should have been prepared and that would have spoilt it . "
259401	259420	259390	259390	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! Oh ! I did n't know you were engaged . So sorry . Excuse me . "
259421	259427	259429	259429	Violet	353	" This is Mr. Orcham , "
259437	259445	259429	259429	Violet	353	" This is Mrs. Oulsnam , sir . "
259544	259551	259552	259552	he	290	" Good evening , Mrs. Oulsnam , "
259556	259562	259563	259563	she	7835	" Good evening , sir , "
259587	259597	259598	259598	Evelyn	290	" How I take the life out of them ! "
259601	259610	259598	259598	Evelyn	290	" I never know them as they are . "
259693	259708	259710	259711	the panjandrum	3408	" She 'll make a fine tale of this to some of the others , "
259733	259744	259746	259747	Mrs. Oulsnam	540	" Well , I 'll leave you , Miss Powler , "
259750	259758	259759	259759	Violet	353	" But how did it all end ? "
259846	259859	259861	259862	Mrs. Oulsnam	540	" I soothed him as well as I could , Miss Powler , "
259869	259882	259861	259862	Mrs. Oulsnam	540	" But he says he is coming up to see Mr. Cousin . "
259883	259892	259894	259894	Violet	353	" Well , thank you , Mrs. Oulsnam , "
259896	259920	259921	259922	Mrs. Oulsnam	540	" Good night . Good night , sir ... Oh ! I think everything is in order for the Rajah , Miss Powler . "
260166	260173	260175	260175	Evelyn	290	" Come in . Come in , "
260177	260183	260149	260151	Fluffy pink Agatha	489	" Thank you , sir . "
260198	260211	260212	260212	she	489	" I 've only brought the reports for Miss Powler , sir , "
260215	260227	260228	260228	Evelyn	290	" Well then . Only give the reports to Miss Powler , "
260242	260252	260238	260238	she	489	" And there 's this about the Imperial suite . "
260261	260269	260258	260258	He	745	" That child 's working rather late . "
260314	260321	260322	260322	he	745	" May I look at those ? "
260326	260331	260332	260332	She	353	" Certainly , sir . "
260364	260372	260374	260374	Evelyn	290	" But I heard from Mr. Cousin , "
260380	260419	260374	260374	Evelyn	290	" I heard you 'd been prescribed complete rest . And here I find you 're giving battle to the Laundry and receiving reports at night from the Floors ! What 's the object of having a doctor ? "
260420	260425	260426	260426	Violet	353	" Well , sir , "
260429	260436	260437	260437	She	353	" you know what women are . "
260442	260485	260437	260437	She	353	" I have n't been giving half an hour a day to my work . But I must keep an eye on things , and I like the staff to come in and see me . And then the Rajah arriving tomorrow . "
260486	260497	260498	260498	he	7860	" Does Dr. Constam know you 're attending to business ? "
260508	260515	260437	260437	She	353	" Not from me , sir . "
260516	260523	260524	260524	He	7860	" Then you 're deceiving him . "
260534	260551	260437	260437	She	353	" I suppose I am , sir . But it does me good . And besides - "
260552	260556	260437	260437	She	353	" Besides what ? "
260557	260619	260437	260437	She	353	" Dr. Constam 's been deceiving me . Does he think I do n't know ? I know there 's nothing the matter with me except I 'm a bit tired - and this sciatica now , of course . And he 's been pretending I 've got something wrong inside me , just to frighten me into being completely idle . "
260620	260626	260437	260437	She	353	" Somebody told you that . "
260627	260640	260437	260437	She	353	" No , sir . No one told me . I guessed . "
260641	260650	260651	260651	he	7861	" Has your mother been to see you ? "
260677	260740	260437	260437	She	353	" Oh no , sir . I only sent her a post - card to say I was too busy to go home on my usual night . If she knew I was under the doctor she 'd worry to death . But I shall tell her about the sciatica , because that does n't matter . She knows all about sciatica . "
260741	260762	260763	260763	Evelyn	290	" She may know all about sciatica , but does she know her daughter is a wicked and deceitful woman ? "
260769	260780	260763	260763	Evelyn	290	" Why this badinage ? It 's out of place . "
260802	260819	260791	260791	he	290	" To return to Ceria . Why did he ask you to go and see him ? "
260839	260871	260872	260872	Violet	353	" He did n't like to come here , and he wanted to talk to me about what he ought to do . So he asked me to go to him , "
260879	260890	260924	260924	his	290	" What he ought to do ? Do about what ? "
260891	260898	260924	260924	his	290	" About returning to his work . "
260899	260914	260924	260924	his	290	" Then he had a notion of returning after all . That was something . "
260931	260959	260924	260924	his	290	" If he thought he ought to return , why did n't he return and have done with it ? There was no need to consult anybody . "
261153	261159	261160	261160	Evelyn	290	" Is she being obstinate ? "
261167	261186	261160	261160	Evelyn	290	" And so he has the nerve to send for you , though he knows you 're ill ! "
261187	261223	261224	261224	Her	353	" No . He 'd no idea I was ill . He could n't have had , because I did n't send for the doctor until the morning after he 'd - he 'd disappeared . "
261232	261243	261245	261245	Evelyn	290	" She 's trying to humour me , is she ? "
261247	261280	261281	261281	He	290	" Soft answer turning away wrath and so on ! Well , it sha n't turn away wrath . Does she imagine I 'm a child to be deceived by those dodges ? "
261285	261293	261281	261281	He	290	" Even if he did n't know - "
261294	261301	261224	261224	Her	353	" But he really did n't . "
261307	261384	261395	261395	He	7867	" I say even if he did n't , he ought not to have appealed to you . I repeat , there was no need for him to consult anybody . But if he had to consult someone , he has experienced colleagues here , friendly colleagues too , whom he knew years before he ever heard of you . They were the proper people to consult . Mind you , I 'm not blaming you . "
261478	261567	261466	261466	He	7867	" You say he could n't help it . I say we do n't want men here who ' ca n't help it . ' And we do n't want men who , when they 're in a fix solely through their own fault , send for our head - housekeeper and take her away from her duties . Remember , you yourself say he did n't know you were ill . Therefore for anything he knew to the contrary he was taking you away from your duties . "
261568	261582	261584	261584	Violet	353	" I expect he sent for me because he thought I should understand , "
261594	261600	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" But do you understand ? "
261604	261868	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" Do you appreciate that a man occupying an important position in this place ca n't be permitted to behave as Ceria has behaved ? He asks you to marry him . You refuse - and quite right too ! And then forsooth he absents himself from his job and gives no explanation and no warning even . If he 'd only telephoned or wired he was ill , everything would have been all right . When a head of department says he 's ill , we accept what he says . We do n't hold a court of enquiry and demand doctor 's certificates . But Ceria does nothing - nothing . He just leaves us in the lurch . Oh yes ! The grill - room , I 've no doubt , has been functioning as usual . But that 's no excuse for Ceria , and no thanks to him . And think of the disturbance and all the anxiety for Mr. Cousin , and others too . A good thing we happen to have a detective of our own here . Otherwise Mr. Cousin would have had to call in the police . A nice thing , Scotland Yard making a hue and cry after a missing head of department who 's only hiding himself because he 's been crossed in love ! Think of the effect on the hotel! .. Well , Miss Powler , Ceria sent for you . You went . And he consulted you . What then ? What did you advise him to do ? "
261869	261883	261466	261466	He	7867	" I told him he ought to come back at once , sir . "
261884	261891	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" And is he coming back ? "
261892	261906	261466	261466	He	7867	" He 's afraid . He asked me to speak to you first . "
261907	261917	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" But he did n't know I was here . "
261918	261925	261466	261466	He	7867	" Yes , he knew that . "
261926	261929	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" How ? "
261930	261959	261466	261466	He	7867	" I told him . Beatrice told me before I left that you were expected back about seven . She 'd heard . Of course everybody had heard . "
261960	262229	261601	261601	Evelyn	290	" And so what he really wanted was that you should make an appeal to me on his behalf . He dare n't do it himself . He shelters behind you ! Nothing doing , Miss Powler ! Nothing at all ! Ceria was an excellent manager of the grill - room , so far as we know . But we did n't know far enough . His behaviour when I sat on his ridiculous scheme for a New Year 's Eve show in his precious grill - room ought to have enlightened us . We passed it over . Mr. Cousin , I may tell you privately , did suggest to me that some notice ought to be taken of that . But I said no . I said we must excuse it because it evidently sprang out of his enthusiasm for his work . But this new affair has n't the remotest connection with his work . And further . If he 's capable of going on in this style because of a crisis in his private life , how do we know he would n't do something fatal if a really big crisis occurred in the grill - room ? We do n't know . We should never feel safe . You 've heard what happened to Miss Brury and to Miss Venables when they failed us . It had to happen . We ca n't have these upsets . To certain rules there simply ca n't be any exception . Nobody is indispensable . Now honestly , do n't you think I 'm right ? "
262310	262335	262293	262293	she	353	" I 'm sorry , sir . But as you ask me , what I say is there 's an exception to every rule . "
262336	262342	262343	262343	Evelyn	290	" So am I sorry ! "
262712	262718	262719	262719	he	290	" Well , Miss Powler , "
262724	262782	262719	262719	he	290	" I regret you 've had all this trouble while you 're ill . But you wanted to see me , and I thought I ought to come . I do hope you 'll have a good night and get well quickly . I 'll see that Constam has a look at you this evening without fail . "
262783	262794	262795	262795	she	7881	" You 're very kind . Thank you , sir , "
263154	263164	263165	263165	Evelyn	290	" That 's your Levering , is n't it ? "
263168	263171	263165	263165	Evelyn	290	" Oui . "
263172	263179	263134	263143	an imposing figure , with a cigar still more imposing	7905	" I 'd better meet him . "
263180	263204	263165	263165	Evelyn	290	" Oui ... Good evening , Lord Levering . I hope you found everything to your liking to - night in the restaurant . "
263211	263219	263221	263222	the magnate	7907	" Ca n't say that I did , "
263235	263244	263246	263246	Cousin	334	" Sorry to hear that , my lord , "
263251	263263	263246	263246	Cousin	334	" May I present Mr. Orcham ? Lord Levering , sir . "
263283	263290	263292	263293	his lordship	5810	" So you 're the foe ! "
263305	263313	263315	263315	Evelyn	290	" I am the arch - foe , "
263317	263320	263322	263323	his lordship	5810	" Well , "
263325	263338	263322	263323	his lordship	5810	" we shall soon be over the top , eh ! What ! "
263339	263345	263347	263347	Evelyn	290	" The sooner the better , "
263349	263358	263360	263361	his lordship	5810	" Your strategy was wrong at the start , "
263363	263370	263322	263323	his lordship	5810	" Oh ! How was that ? "
263371	263383	263385	263386	his lordship	5810	" You 'd like to know . But you wo n't , "
263498	263508	263509	263509	he	608	" I 'm not as young as I was , "
263513	263549	263550	263550	he	608	" and I expect to be told I have n't moved with the times . This is my first taste of your hotel , for instance . I 'll tell you what your hotel is , "
263555	263704	263705	263705	He	7916	" It 's a drinking den . That 's what it is . At least the restaurant is . If your restaurant is the times , perhaps it 's just as well I have n't moved with them . I 've seen enough alcohol drunk to - night to float a company . And I hear this is what you call your extension night , and you keep it up till two o'clock . I 'd like to know what your female customers look like when they wake up in the morning soaked in the poison you give them - at how much a glass ? And what sort of a day 's work their men do next day . And young women as brazen as strumpets painting their faces in public ! Even strumpets did n't do that in my young days . And smoking like chimneys . "
263713	263796	263705	263705	He	7916	" And then I 'm positively told you keep young men here , pay them , to dance with libidinous old women . Holding them in their arms , women they have n't been introduced to , and clasping their fat bodies , and smirking at them , and making eyes at them , and cantering round with them . That 's what 's not to my liking in your restaurant , you , sir , I do n't know your name . "
263807	263958	263797	263797	He	7917	" Your food 's good . And so is your mineral water . But for the rest - You 've heard of the fall of the Roman Empire . We used to learn at school that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton - not that I went to Eton . No , I went to the mills . I do n't know where Waterloo was won . I should have said myself it was won at Waterloo . But I know this . The Roman Empire was lost in circuses and orgies , and the British Empire 's being lost in your restaurant . Yes , right here , and now ! And yet you laugh at me if I fight your proposed arrangements for losing it quicker . Want to get it over , I suppose ! You wait till Prohibition comes , as it will . "
263983	264005	263978	263978	Evelyn	290	" I shall be very interested to see Prohibition at work . It 's been such an unqualified success in America - "
264006	264082	263978	263978	Evelyn	290	" You laugh , Mr. Orcham . But you 're laughing on the wrong side of your face . As regards America , do n't forget that America is n't a law - abiding country . England is . And if England votes for Prohibition , it will obey Prohibition , sir . And then where shall you be , and where will your fancy men and your fancy women and your fancy dividends be ? "
264083	264090	264092	264092	Evelyn	290	" No doubt in the soup , "
264112	264118	264119	264120	Lord Levering	608	" Come along , Maria , "
264125	264152	264119	264120	Lord Levering	608	" When you girls get into one of those places , God knows when you 'll come out again . Ten minutes I 've been waiting . "
264223	264236	264238	264238	he	608	" I do n't mind telling you where your strategy went wrong , "
264243	264282	264238	264238	he	608	" You 'll never do anything with this Licensing Commission . You ought to have begun by packing it . I did . Good night to you . It 's the rule to shake hands before a fight . "
264294	264305	264307	264307	Evelyn	290	" It 's fortunate there were n't many people about , "
264324	264330	264332	264332	Cousin	334	" Ça n'a pas d'importance , "
264334	264371	264332	264332	Cousin	334	" This is only his second full day here , but everyone knows him and his style . Lady Levering was not really offended by him . She quarrels with him once a day on purpose . "
264372	264375	264449	264449	Cousin	334	" Why ? "
264376	264420	264332	264332	Cousin	334	" So that he sha n't kiss her , I 'm told . She 'll come back here soon and order a liqueur brandy . She did that yesterday after lunch . So long as he does n't kiss her she 's safe . "
264421	264429	264431	264431	Evelyn	290	" Well , it 's a shame ! "
264433	264440	264431	264431	Evelyn	290	" He 's a great fellow . "
264441	264448	264449	264449	Cousin	334	" C'est malin , les femmes ! "
264489	264492	264494	264494	Evelyn	290	" Hello ! "
264501	264531	264494	264494	Evelyn	290	" I told them to tell you I should n't do anything to - night . You know I never do till next day , when I get home . "
264602	264609	264610	264611	Miss Cass	336	" Good evening , Mr. Orcham . "
264627	264646	264610	264611	Miss Cass	336	" I had a few things to do , and I thought perhaps you might just look in . "
264650	264658	264647	264647	Evelyn	290	" All these girls work too hard . "
264678	264684	264647	264647	Evelyn	290	" Any telegrams for me ? "
264717	264723	264705	264705	she	304	" Yes sir , one . "
264734	264738	264705	264705	she	304	" Who from ? "
264739	264745	264705	264705	she	304	" Sir Henry , sir . "
264750	264787	264705	264705	she	304	" And there 's a very long letter from Sir Henry too . From Berlin . I 've left them on your desk in case you did happen to come here , and I 'd gone . "
264788	264813	264837	264837	she	336	" Thanks . And you ought to be gone . Tuesday is n't one of your late nights . You 'll be falling ill . "
264814	264820	264822	264823	Miss Cass	336	" I was just going , "
264866	264870	264837	264837	she	336	" Good night . "
264871	264877	264848	264848	she	336	" Good night , sir . "
265073	265076	265077	265077	he	290	" My - "
265080	265084	265085	265085	He	290	" My what ? "
265088	265092	265085	265085	He	290	" My everything . "
265954	265971	265948	265948	He	745	" My dear Everything . Are you in bed ? Are you wearing the nightdress I bought you?"
266304	266332	266333	266333	He	745	" I want to share you intimately , and I want you to share me intimately . I 've had a fantastic time since I got here . "
266379	266395	266366	266366	He	745	" Darling , I love you . Thine , Evelyn the so - called lion . "
266460	266483	266454	266454	he	745	" Get a pass - key from someone , and go upstairs to my room and bring down my hat and overcoat . "
266632	266636	266638	266638	Evelyn	290	" You see , "
266642	266652	266638	266638	Evelyn	290	" I 'm not borrowing yours to - night . "
266658	266671	266655	266656	Long Sam	294	" I 'm just going out for a short walk , Sam . "
267040	267045	267046	267046	Violet	353	" Where am I ? "
267083	267098	267100	267100	Violet	353	" In your new bedroom , miss . I should say Miss Maclaren 's . "
267221	267228	267229	267229	she	353	" I 'm better , Beaty , "
267232	267249	267250	267250	Beatrice	466	" It 's them violet - rays , miss . Violet to the Violet , miss . "
267292	267301	267303	267303	Violet	353	" I do believe I 'm quite better , "
267305	267310	267312	267312	Beatrice	466	" Well , miss , "
267314	267414	267312	267312	Beatrice	466	" Dr. Constam did say to me - he 's always very nice and friendly like with me , and to be sure I 've been here a lot longer than he has - he said it might be three days or it might be three weeks , and I said , I said , with you it was more likely to be three days . There 's some here as would be three months with it , not three weeks , because when they get down nothing will get 'em up again . But what I always say - "
267415	267440	267441	267442	Miss Jixon	619	" Beatrice . Fetch Miss Jixon for me , will you ? She 's bound to be about somewhere . It 's frightfully late . "
267531	267536	267537	267537	she	353	" Damn the doctor ! "
267543	267587	267537	267537	she	353	" He told me he should cure me , and he 's vexed because he has cured me . Well , he can be vexed ! I 'm certain I 've had ten times more of his repose than was good for me . "
267596	267599	267601	267601	Violet	353	" Agatha ! "
267609	267767	267601	267601	Violet	353	" Before I forget . Tell everyone I sha n't want any more of those reports to - night . I 'm perfectly well again , had a splendid sleep . Sciatica all gone . Have you brought the letters ? No ? Well , bring them to me in half an hour . And any message from Craven Street about the new carpet for 441.And find out what 's happened about the leak in the radiator in 275 . And telephone Mr. Cousin and see if Mr. Purkin has written to him about coming up . And - that 'll do for the present . Run along . We shall have a big day to - day . Oh ! If Dr. Constam rings up , say you 've seen me and I 'm much , much better , and there 's no need for him to come and see me until he 's quite free . "
267776	267794	267796	267796	Violet	353	" The little thing ca n't understand me getting a move on . She 's fearfully slow , "
267932	267937	267923	267923	She	353	" Who 's speaking ? "
267938	267945	267946	267946	She	353	" Ceria . I 've come . "
268003	268008	267992	267992	she	353	" Where are you ? "
268009	268014	267992	267992	she	353	" In my office . "
268019	268029	268030	268030	she	353	" I 'll come down and see you there , "
268036	268055	268030	268030	she	353	" That will be better than you coming up here . I 'll be down in three minutes . "
268399	268408	268409	268409	she	353	" I 'm so glad you 're here , "
268413	268420	268421	268421	Ceria	511	" Yes , I 'm here . "
268432	268440	268421	268421	Ceria	511	" But what am I to do ? "
268497	268506	268507	268507	she	353	" I have brought him down to this , "
268550	268566	268545	268545	he	1015	" Poor boy ! He ca n't help it . It is n't his fault . "
268598	268623	268578	268578	she	353	" It 's my fault . I must have encouraged him without knowing it . I do like him . He 's a dear . "
268653	268766	268646	268646	her	353	" If I married him , if I even gave him the least sign , he 'd be a new man . I could make him the greatest man in the world . He might have a fashionable restaurant of his own . Would not this be the simplest way ? I could go to Sir Henry 's and Ceria could find a new place , and then when we 'd saved some money - And he 's such a dear ! And he worships me - how funny ! Me ! And he 'd do anything I told him . And I do like him . Nobody could help liking him . "
268822	268829	268830	268830	she	8056	" Now I 'll tell you , "
268834	268840	268830	268830	she	8056	" Who have you seen ? "
268841	268869	268893	268893	She	8056	" No one , except Maxon . I walked quickly from the staff entrance and no one saw me ; at least no one spoke to me . "
268870	268875	268876	268876	she	8056	" That 's splendid ! "
268879	268892	268893	268893	She	8056	" I do n't want you to see anybody - at first . "
268910	268918	268919	268919	Ceria	511	" Have you spoken to the Director ? "
268923	268935	268944	268944	her	8056	" Oh yes ! I think that will be all right . "
269503	269508	269487	269487	She	8056	" And now - ! "
269517	269523	269524	269524	She	8056	" I could make him . "
269598	269690	269589	269589	She	8056	" You must go on just as if you had n't been away at all . Everybody will be glad to see you . Do n't begin explaining or finding excuses . You 've no call to explain anything to the people under you . It 's none of their business . You can do it all right . Of course you can . In fact it 's quite easy . Whatever you usually do at this time of the morning , do it now , as if nothing had happened . "
269691	269694	269695	269695	he	8059	" Yes , "
269699	269731	269695	269695	he	8059	" But Mr. Cousin ... and Mr. Orcham ? I must tell them I 've come back . I shall have to see one of them , perhaps both of them . "
269736	270016	270017	270017	Her	8078	" Of course you 'll have to see them . But not at once . You go on with your ordinary work and go into the grill - room at lunch - time as usual . And you 'll see - you 'll see how nice everyone will be . You 'll feel better . They 'll make you feel better . They 'll make you feel more equal to things . And then this afternoon you can go and see Mr. Cousin or Mr. Orcham . They 'll know you 're back , then . They 'll have heard . And do n't you go and think you have n't been ill , because you have . That motor - accident was enough without anything else . You are ill ; your nerves are ill ; and it would have been more sensible if you 'd sent for your maid back and gone to bed and had a doctor . But as you 're here - well , you 're here ! And if you ask me I think you 've been wonderful . Yes I do , really ! You do n't know how wonderful you are . If you 'll only do as I say I 'm perfectly certain there 'll be no trouble . There ca n't be . Now I shall rely on you , dear Mr. Ceria . I 'll answer for you to anybody , and I 'm sure you wo n't let me down . Why ! I should like to know how many men who 'd been in a motor - accident , in the middle of the night too - "
270034	270118	270030	270030	she	8078	" You may have been ill , Mr. Ceria . I do n't say you have n't been . I 'm sorry . But I ca n't help that , and I have to think of the Floors menus . You may say they 're not in my department . But what I say is , the visitors complain just as much to me as they do to Mr. Perosi . They 've been complaints about the short menus for weeks , and - "
270160	270168	270169	270169	she	8078	" Oh ! I 'm so sorry , "
270174	270218	270169	270169	she	8078	" Are n't you Mr. Fontenay ? I came to see Mr. Ceria about something on the Floors . I 'm the head - housekeeper . I can come another time . I know I must n't interfere with grill - room business . "
270246	270251	270253	270254	the Frenchman	3577	" Yes , miss , "
270340	270504	270331	270331	She	8078	" You know Mr. Ceria has had a motor - accident . He was n't hurt , but he 's been rather upset by it . I think he must have fainted , and I daresay he lost his memory . If he had n't he 'd have telephoned to you or got someone to telephone . Anyhow , he was too much upset to go home till last night . I 'm afraid I have n't been going the right way to work with him . If you heard me I do hope you wo n't say anything . I 've had some worry upstairs , but I know that 's no excuse for speaking to him as I did . I believe he 's come here to - day when he really was n't well enough to come . But he told me he was quite recovered . If he had n't I should n't have talked as I did talk . "
270505	270510	270511	270516	The second - in - command	1240	" Yes , miss . "
270526	270561	270511	270516	The second - in - command	1240	" It is Mr. Rocco who wishes to see Mr. Ceria . He heard that Mr. Ceria was in the hotel . Mr. Rocco - there has been a misunderstanding - it is urgent . "
270565	270587	270562	270562	Violet	353	" Fancy the poor boy hoping he had n't been seen ! As if everything was n't seen in this place ! "
270661	270669	270670	270670	she	353	" I think I 'd better go , "
270676	270692	270670	270670	she	353	" Least said , soonest mended . I 'm sure you understand , Mr. Fontenay . "
270693	270698	270699	270699	Fontenay	622	" Yes , miss . "
270977	270983	270985	270985	Violet	353	" Now , my dear , "
271355	271367	271335	271353	the working chief of the improvised organism which was creating an organism vaster than itself - the Orcham Merger	8117	" Ask Smiss . See Smiss . Mr. Smiss will know . "
272093	272098	272100	272100	he	567	" Time 's up ! "
272103	272118	272100	272100	he	567	" I have an appointment . You 're safe for a week , Smiss . "
272119	272127	272128	272128	Smiss	403	" I think so , Sir Henry . "
272136	272145	272147	272147	Smiss	403	" If this barbarian had been to Balliol , "
272155	272165	272147	272147	Smiss	403	" he might have been a little more civilised . "
272192	272198	272200	272200	he	403	" I say , Evelyn , "
272202	272224	272200	272200	he	403	" There 's just one nuisance about the Duncannon . You 'll be able to straighten the thing out for me . "
272242	272245	272247	272247	Evelyn	290	" Yes ? "
272255	272266	272247	272247	Evelyn	290	" Good morning , my boy . How are you ? "
272267	272274	272276	272276	Smiss	403	" Good morning , Mr. Orcham , "
272280	272300	272276	272276	Smiss	403	" Although he was never at Balliol , or even at Cambridge , the Director is a civilised being . "
272527	272539	272540	272540	he	567	" You 're pretty friendly with Gracie , are n't you ? "
272567	272570	272571	272571	he	567	" Yes , "
272574	272583	272571	272571	he	567	" I think we are very good friends . "
272593	272605	272554	272554	His	567	" Did she ever say anything to you about Leo Cheddar ? "
272606	272634	272554	272554	His	567	" Nothing much . She did once tell me something about him . She 's got a fairly good opinion of him . I liked him myself . "
272635	272644	272554	272554	His	567	" Oh ! You 've met him then ? "
272645	272655	272554	272554	His	567	" Quite accidentally , in Paris , one day . "
272656	272750	272554	272554	His	567	" Oh ! There you are ! She 's got a good opinion of him ? I always thought she had , but she 's never said so to me . I found a cable from her here this morning . It had followed me from Berlin . She did n't say so in so many words , very cautious she is - sometimes ; but my notion is she means to marry Leo . I should rather like it . I want her to marry , and Leo 's quite her sort . "
272751	272754	272756	272756	Evelyn	290	" Really ! "
272758	272772	272756	272756	Evelyn	290	" Well , if it suits both you and her I 'm glad . "
272773	272781	272782	272783	Sir Henry	567	" I 'm rather excited about it , "
273175	273184	273172	273172	he	290	" I suppose there is nothing in it . "
273389	273396	273398	273398	Cousin	334	" You have heard about Ceria ? "
273400	273410	273430	273430	Evelyn	290	" He 's returned . He 's at work . "
273411	273414	273430	273430	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
273415	273425	273430	273430	Evelyn	290	" He has n't been to see me yet . "
273426	273429	273430	273430	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
273567	273589	273555	273555	he	334	" If there was anything in it , what a solution it would be , what a simplifying of my life ! "
273854	273890	273846	273847	her chief	8203	" You are n't taking this hotel seriously . You are in one of your rare funny moods , and you are shirking . If I shirked , I should soon be hearing about it . "
274002	274008	274010	274010	Evelyn	290	" Now let 's see , "
274024	274049	274020	274020	he	334	" I happen to be here , so it occurs to me to amuse myself with this trifling menial task of untying a bundle . "
274094	274099	274100	274100	he	334	" Here you are ! "
274116	274124	274100	274100	he	334	" I 'll look at these myself , "
274287	274299	274260	274260	she	304	" Donnez - moi de quoi écrire , s'il vous plait . "
274400	274859	274397	274397	He	334	" DEAR EVELYN . You will understand . I am deep in grief . Do n't hate me , but I do n't think you will , you are so supersensible . Why say it over again ? I said it all yesterday afternoon after we 'd been to the Jolie Laitiere . Perhaps you do love me , but not in my way . And it 's too early for you to know for certain in yourself whether you love me or not , even in your way . You may think you do . I know you will never love me in my way ; you could n't . Your sense of proportion is too just for that . Yes , I love you , but I shall cure myself . And it 's more important to me to be loved than to love . To be loved without a shred of any reserve is a necessity for me . I 've felt it for years ; but I 've never had it - I mean I 've never had it to live in , like an atmosphere day and night . If I 'm not absolutely everything to a man , then I 'll be nothing to him . That 's how I am made , and I ca n't help it . I 'm an egotist . Well , I ca n't help that either . They say there 's more happiness in loving than in being loved . Not for me . I 'm not the sort of woman for you . You need the other sort . And you 'll find it , and sooner than you think , perhaps . You do n't wish me to apologise to you , do you ? I should never have been content if we had n't tried our experiment . I should always have regretted not trying it , because if I had n't tried it I should always have suspected that I 'd missed a chance . You 'll be miserable , but it was worth it , was n't it ? You 'll forget it . It will fade out of your commonsensical heart . Good - bye , lion . I saw Leo this afternoon , and I told him I 'd marry him . He 's asked me several times . He was very happy . It was touching . I 'm not happy yet , of course , but I shall be . The atmosphere of his love will make me happy . I 've sent him away while I 'm writing this . Naturally he knows nothing of us , and wo n't . Good - bye . G. "
275072	275090	275063	275063	He	568	" DEAR GRACIE .. Thank you for your letter . Good - bye . Yours , E. O. "
275140	275143	275144	275144	he	568	" Here ! "
275155	275162	275144	275144	he	568	" You can deal with these . "
275163	275175	275176	275176	he	568	" Give me a twopence - halfpenny stamp , will you ? "
275232	275246	275247	275247	he	568	" Some contrast between this one and the one I posted last night ! "
275304	275311	275298	275298	He	568	" What 's going on here ? "
275312	275363	275364	275364	Mowlem	312	" His highness the Rajah has come , sir . His highness has gone upstairs , the ladies as well - veiled , sir . And we are expecting another motor - car yet . But there wo n't be any more ladies - people are hoping there will be . "
275371	275381	275382	275382	Evelyn	627	" Oh ! That 's it , is it ? "
276184	276188	276180	276180	she	336	" Mr. Orcham . "
276189	276192	276193	276193	He	629	" Well ? "
276200	276260	276180	276180	she	336	" There 's just come down a message from the Royal suite - Mr. Harbour , you know , sir - for Mr. Cousin to go up there at once . Some difficulty . Miss Tilton has telephoned me that Mr. Cousin is out - she thinks he 's gone to Craven Street about something urgent for the Rajah . "
276261	276271	276272	276272	Evelyn	290	" What 's the difficulty with the cigarette fellow ? "
276342	276350	276423	276423	He	290	" I ca n't say , sir . "
276351	276358	276423	276423	He	290	" Ca n't Mr. Pozzi go ? "
276359	276369	276423	276423	He	290	" Mr. Pozzi is n't in either , sir . "
276370	276378	276423	276423	He	290	" Well , he ought to be . "
276379	276404	276423	276423	He	290	" Yes , sir . But Mr. Harbour asked particularly for Mr. Cousin . It was Mrs. Harbour who telephoned , Miss Tilton says . "
276405	276422	276423	276423	He	290	" Oh ! Mrs. Harbour , was it ? Well , I 'll go up myself . "
277020	277025	276995	276997	another young man	8334	" Yes , sir . "
277042	277047	276995	276997	another young man	8334	" Saturday Evening Post . "
277048	277062	277064	277064	Evelyn	290	" Mr. Harbour , or Mrs. Harbour , wants to see the manager , "
277084	277100	276995	276997	another young man	8334	" But say ! You are n't Mr. Cousin . We asked for Mr. Cousin . "
277101	277125	276995	276997	another young man	8334	" My name is Orcham . Mr. Cousin is not in . I 'm what you may call Mr. Cousin 's superior officer . "
277126	277161	277162	277162	He	290	" Well , I thought Mr. Cousin was the head - god here . Will you please come in , Mr. Orcham ? Glad to meet you . Boss , this is Mr. Orcham . "
277237	277253	277255	277258	the cigarette - king	8341	" Mr. Orcham ? Mr. Orcham . This is a great pleasure , Mr. Orcham , "
277262	277267	277268	277270	cigarette - king	8348	" Come right in . "The
277277	277340	277275	277275	Evelyn	290	" I was very sorry to miss meeting you when you were over on our side . Mr. Staten 's an old and valued friend of mine . He told me about you . He 's a lovely man . You 've got some hotel here , Mr. Orcham . I 've not stayed here before . Mrs. Harbour liked the Majestic . "
277341	277347	277349	277349	Evelyn	290	" That 's mine too , "
277351	277384	277275	277275	Evelyn	290	" Oh , I know . Been a lot of talk down town in New York about your Merger , Mr. Orcham . You 've got a great thing there , sir . "
277425	277429	277423	277430	his young " Saturday Evening Post " secretary	8349	" Saturday Evening Post "
277575	277580	277582	277582	Evelyn	290	" No , thanks , "
277584	277595	277582	277582	Evelyn	290	" But if I may have one of your cigarettes - "
277596	277601	277550	277550	He	629	" You sure can . "
277614	277643	277582	277582	Evelyn	290	" Mrs. Harbour uses this room as her boudoir , that 's why I brought you in here . It 's Mrs. Harbour you 've come to see . "
277657	277660	277652	277652	He	629	" Emily ! "
277996	278002	278003	278003	Emily	527	" Well , Mr. Orcham , "
278006	278018	278003	278003	Emily	527	" I want you to know that I 'm from Kentucky - "
278152	278164	278166	278166	Evelyn	290	" I am not aware of any harem , Mrs. Harbour , "
278168	278176	278177	278178	Mrs. Harbour	631	" Then what are all those creatures ? "
278181	278199	278177	278178	Mrs. Harbour	631	" That 's all I 'd like to know . With their veils and gauzes and things . "
278306	278417	278303	278303	He	629	" I admire your stand , Mrs. Harbour . Of course we innkeepers are not quite our own masters . The Rajah comes from one of the oldest reigning families in the East . His forefathers have lived in what I daresay they 'd think is splendid civilisation for many centuries , long before Britain was colonised or America discovered . But I admit that all that is beside the point . Yes , I fully admit it . I would ask his highness to leave , but that might lead to serious trouble , in fact to international complications , for he will be lunching with King George tomorrow . "
278418	278427	278284	278284	his	629	" But not his harem , I hope . "
278428	278437	278303	278303	He	629	" Certainly not . If harem there is . "
278438	278488	278284	278284	his	629	" If ' ! Then what are they ? Nautch girls ? I know the world , Mr. Orcham , and I know that there must be immorality , but to flaunt it openly , and in a respectable hotel where respectable people stay never thinking , never expecting - "
278489	278493	278494	278494	Evelyn	290	" Mrs. Harbour , "
278501	278536	278537	278537	He	290	" I agree . I agree . And let me say that you have taught me a lesson which I shall always remember . And I do hope you 'll accept my sincere apologies . "
278542	278556	278537	278537	He	290	" If it 's to be a farce , I 'll be farcical . "
278627	278633	278634	278634	he	290	" Now as regards leaving , "
278637	278766	278634	278634	he	290	" I fully understand your scruples about staying here . I sympathise with them . You wish to leave at once . We shall be exceedingly sorry to lose you , for visitors like you and Mr. Harbour mean a very great deal to us . We do n't get them every day , no , nor every year . Still , we have brought your leaving us on ourselves . Now I have two other hotels , the Majestic and the Duncannon . I think you 'd rather approve the Majestic , and I may say that it is even better now than it used to be . I will personally guarantee ... I will see to everything myself ... I will telephone myself and give instructions - "
278787	278801	278803	278804	Mr. Harbour	629	" I think Mr. Orcham has met us very fairly , my dear , "
278870	278884	278886	278889	the cigarette - king	8341	" This Merger of yours is a very interesting proposition , Mr. Orcham , "
278900	278930	278897	278897	Evelyn	290	" I 've really nothing to do with that side of it ; but I 'll speak to Sir Henry Savott . I 'm sure he would feel flattered . "
278962	279331	278958	278959	one another	1077	" This has n't really happened , because it could n't have happened . That Rajah , with two thousand years of civilisation in his way of walking and holding his head as he walks , shovelled up and thrown into a corner by the Kentucky squaw from Louisville . Nobody will believe it . Who could ? The cigarette - king 's in fear of his life of her . Why make twenty million cigarettes a day when this is all you get for it ? A good stroke - it will divide the publicity between the Palace and the Majestic . Palace does n't need publicity , Majestic does . Must find a good picturesque reason for the flitting . Immerson will think of one . Immerson will simply go off his head with joy . He 's never had anything to touch it . Monstrous ! Monstrous ! They 're all alike . She was so damned attentive and efficient yesterday only because she 'd positively made up her mind to get rid of me . No ! Well , perhaps she wanted to make me regret her all the more with her thoughtfulness and her smart organising ; make me realise afterwards what a complete all - round sort of a creature I 'd lost . ' Be still and know that I am God . ' How does she make that square with what she 's done ? I suppose she thinks that it means being still and being herself and letting everything else go , and God created her as she is , and so it 's all right , and it does n't matter what happens to other people so long as she 's herself and acts herself . Does n't matter about me , for instance , so long as she 's herself . It 's enough to make you laugh . I 'm miserable , and what a fool I am to be miserable ! She 's ruined me . No , she has n't . I wo n't let her . I 'll show her . But they 're all alike . Monstrous ! I 'm miserable . Idiot !
279332	279727	278958	278959	one another	1077	" I hope she 'll appreciate my letter . My letter was a masterpiece . There 's something tremendous about that girl . There never was another girl like her . What a mind ! What breasts ! I 'm miserable . She could make a mackintosh and a sixty - franc chemise de nuit look stylish and expensive . Says she 's in love with me . Well , I believe she is too . And I hope to God she wo n't be able to sleep for thinking of me . No . She 's only in love with herself . Did n't she say she was an egotist and they all were ? She 'll ruin her Leo Cheddar , though . I 've escaped . Not his money . No , she 's not mean . She 's magnificent , curse her ! She 'll draw the soul out of him , and eat it and drink it , till there 's nothing left . What breasts ! And what a voice ! She 's glorious . I 've escaped . What kind of a mess would she have made of me ? And I 've escaped and I 'm miserable . And nobody knows , except her . I 'll send her a wedding present . Six nightgowns from the Stores . Chaste Anglo - Indian taste . Then she 'll have to explain them to her Leo . ' The Nature of the Universe ' ! The Nature of Women ! They 're all alike . She 's terrific , but the Kentucky squaw is more terrific , because she 's got nothing but her self - conceit to do it with . She 's ugly and stupid and old , but she can do it . She 's done it , and she 'll keep on doing it until she drops . She ought to be abandoned to a brutal and licentious soldiery , that squaw ought . Teach her a thing or two . But it 'd be no use . They would n't touch her if you bribed them . She 's safe . She 's safe even from the cigarette - king . If he does n't amuse himself with something less like a female rhinoceros he 's the biggest ass that God ever made .
279728	280041	278958	278959	one another	1077	" If she was the mother of the Rajah she 'd rule the Rajah and all Java and Morocco and Cambodia or wherever it is he comes from . She 'd stick behind the purdah , and she 'd be the boss of all the Orient . And nobody could tell how in hell she did it . And would n't the odalisques have a thin time ! Like hell they would . But I 've beaten her , if she 's never been beaten before . She did n't see I was laughing at her . What a woman ! She 'd swallow anything . The top of her bent 's higher than the Himalaya . I 'm miserable . Fancy her taking that boulevard flat all on her own ! And buying the Baedeker . An artist ! Female Don Juan . Donna Juana . That 's it . Donna Juana ! Always running around and making out to herself that she 's searching for the ideal . And I believe she really believes it . A whip might keep her in order . It 's the only thing that would . And I never thought of it . What I ought to do is to go back with a cane and rip everything off her , and give her a hiding until she fainted away , and then when she came to make her kneel down and beg my pardon for being thrashed . That 's one argument we always have , muscles , the muscular argument . Oh ! What a rogue and peasant slave am I ! And it 's the one argument they understand . I 'm dashed if my stomach is n't all cold lead . Curious the connection between mind and body . It 's all imagination , but my stomach 's like lead . "
280288	280291	280292	280292	Cousin	334	" Yes , "
280299	280322	280295	280295	his	334	" I could believe anything of these Anglo - Saxon ladies . But it is necessary that this affair should be arranged . "
280323	280338	280295	280295	his	334	" At once . I leave all the details to you , mon cher . "
280339	280342	280344	280344	Cousin	334	" Hm ! "
280351	280371	280344	280344	Cousin	334	" It 's all very well for you to give the order , but it will want some doing . "
280372	280395	280295	280295	his	334	" Send up Pozzi or someone to offer any help they need about packing , and then get busy on the Majestic . "
280396	280405	280407	280407	Cousin	334	" I 've just come from Craven Street , "
280410	280422	280407	280407	Cousin	334	" I wanted to see you . Collifant is on strike . "
280432	280441	280295	280295	his	334	" On strike ? What do you mean ? "
280442	280455	280295	280295	his	334	" About a lit de repos that the Rajah has asked for . "
280456	280471	280295	280295	his	334	" What on earth 's a lit de repos ? A day - bed ? "
280472	280608	280295	280295	his	334	" Yes , that 's what you call it . He says he ca n't supply it today or to - morrow . He says the Rajah 's visit has exhausted him already , and exhausted the carpenters too , and it ca n't be done until the day after to - morrow . He will not listen to the suggestion of overtime . He says the carpenters were working all last night , and there would be an insurrection . The Rajah objects to a sofa , or at least they say he objects . It must be a day - bed . I thought it would be well to buy one . That man Harris in Oxford Street might have one , and in any case he would know where to find one . "
280609	280615	280616	280616	Evelyn	290	" Not on your life ! "
280626	280643	280295	280295	his	334	" What 's the point of having a Works Department , I should like to know ! "
280644	280654	280295	280295	his	334	" Well , I have done all I could . "
280655	280661	280663	280663	Evelyn	290	" But I have n't , "
280665	280716	280663	280663	Evelyn	290	" I 'll go over to Craven Street myself , and I 'll see whether Master Collifant will strike or not . I never heard of such a thing . If we want a day - bed we 'll have it , and we will have it from Craven Street . "
280717	280721	280723	280723	Cousin	334	" Thank you , "
280742	280749	280739	280739	He	334	" Ceria came to see me . "
280750	280758	280663	280663	Evelyn	290	" Well , you gave him notice ? "
280759	280784	280739	280739	He	334	" No . I received no instructions from you . It seemed to me you had decided nothing - when I spoke to you . "
280791	280791	280788	280788	you	334	"
280792	280826	280663	280663	Evelyn	290	" I listened . He told me that he had not been in a state to telephone or write . I said to him that he should carry on - for the present . "
280827	280846	280788	280788	you	334	" But last night I gave you - Never mind now . I 'm off to Craven Street . "
281080	281085	281086	281086	she	8418	" Sorry , sir , "
281353	281515	281340	281340	her	540	inco"rdination of effort , due to Violet having been laid aside , vitiated the activities of the Floors . Mrs. Oulsnam was not aware that the power of Mr. Cousin himself had been directly invoked by the Rajah 's French secretary . And Mr. Cousin did not know that Violet had resumed duty . He would have known , had not her subordinates and others , secretly from Violet , conspired to conceal her dangerous defiance of Dr. Constam from the superior authorities . Violet had impulsively taken the day - bed job to herself , because in a flash , even as Mrs. Oulsnam was speaking , she had an idea . She had never before heard of a day - bed , but she recalled having seen , amid the litter of the carpenter 's shop on Eighth , an article which now seemed to her to correspond with Mrs. Oulsnam 's description of what a day - bed was .
282076	282087	282088	282088	she	353	" It 's worse than being on the blasted ocean , "
282379	282382	282383	282383	she	353	" Well , "
282392	282403	282383	282383	she	353	" I 've arrived - what 's left of me ! "
282482	282489	282490	282490	Violet	353	" Can we get it down ? "
282493	282500	282490	282490	Violet	353	" I ca n't , miss . "
282501	282509	282490	282490	Violet	353	" You can if I help you . "
282518	282526	282527	282527	she	353	" That 's all , thank you , "
282530	282534	282527	282527	she	353	" Good night . "
282647	282650	282651	282651	she	353	" Frank , "
282654	282676	282651	282651	she	353	" just get someone . Tell them I want the lift for a piece of furniture to go to the Upholstery . "
282711	282716	282717	282717	Violet	353	" Mr. Collifant about ? "
282748	282762	282764	282765	the girl	796	" I think he 's in his office seeing someone , Miss Powler , "
282767	282785	282786	282786	Violet	353	" Then run and find Mrs. Rowbotham for me , will you ? Iwant her this minute . "
283213	283237	283207	283208	Mrs. Rowbotham	643	" What about Mr. Collifant ? I take my orders from Mr. Collifant . And you know , Miss Powler , he 's - "
283238	283351	283352	283353	Mrs. Rowbotham	643	" Mr. Collifant 's engaged just now , and the day - bed 's very urgent . It must be started at once , and finished somehow in one hour . I shall stay here till it 's done , and I shall take it back with me . I 'll settle with Mr. Collifant . If Mr. Collifant is n't available , I ca n't help that . I 've got my own responsibilities as head - housekeeper , and if I say a thing 's wanted it is : and Mr. Collifant knows that as well as anybody . It 's not as if the Rajah was an ordinary visitor . "
283708	283721	283723	283723	Violet	353	" I 'm afraid it 's all my doing , Mr. Collifant , "
283894	283903	283905	283905	Violet	353	" Can I speak to you a moment ? "
283941	284003	283938	283938	Violet	353	" I 'm very sorry I could n't consult you . But I could n't . This day - bed job is really urgent . I tell you so as head - housekeeper . I 've come here on purpose . If you stop it I shall hold you responsible and I shall go at once to Mr. Cousin and report . "
284008	284033	284005	284005	she	353	" And a nice mess I 'm getting myself into ! It 'll be war between him and me now for ever and ever . "
284034	284043	284045	284046	Mr. Collifant	640	" I shall report to Mr. Cousin too , "
284058	284072	284049	284049	he	640	" Here ! You ! You 'd better get ahead with this thing . "
284320	284324	284300	284300	She	353	" I. P. H. "
284822	284832	284834	284834	Evelyn	290	" I think you and I can go now , "
284953	284968	284969	284969	Violet	353	" I thought I would stay , sir , and take it back myself . "
284993	285001	285003	285003	Evelyn	290	" I 've arranged all about that , "
285008	285019	285003	285003	Evelyn	290	" You quite understand , do n't you , Collifant ? "
285020	285025	285026	285027	Mr. Collifant	640	" Yes , sir , "
285031	285060	285026	285027	Mr. Collifant	640	" You can come with me in my car , Miss Powler . I left word for it to follow me . I came here in a taxi . "
285061	285066	285068	285068	Violet	353	" Yes , sir , "
285189	285221	285186	285186	Violet	353	" I see the house next door is to let . You 'll have four hotels now to deal with , and perhaps the Works Department will have to be enlarged . "
285357	285362	285354	285355	Miss Powler	353	" If she knew ! ..
285370	285380	285363	285363	He	290	" Yes . We 've got it in view . "
285392	285414	285389	285389	He	290	" I 'll mention that to old Dennis . She has a head on her , no mistake ! Curse her ! "
285463	285480	285482	285482	Evelyn	290	" I 'd like you to come to my office if you can spare a minute , "
285486	285493	285498	285498	his	290	" Certainly , sir . Now ? "
285587	285601	285579	285579	Evelyn	290	" I 'm engaged , and I do n't want to be disturbed . "
285606	285613	285602	285603	Miss Cass	336	" Hello ! What 's this ? "
285674	285681	285683	285683	Evelyn	290	" Sit down , will you ? "
286342	286395	286336	286336	he	290	" You were ill last night , Miss Powler , in the doctor 's hands . But to - day you are up and about . I was amazed to see you at Craven Street . Was it wise ? We do n't keep a doctor here for him to be defied . "
286416	286467	286408	286408	he	290	" You might easily have a relapse . Serious . And then where should we be ? Where would the Palace be ? The first duty of everyone on my staff is to keep healthy . There 's such a thing as too much zeal , especially with you women . "
286577	286642	286643	286643	She	353	" I quite see what you mean sir . But perhaps you do n't know that Dr. Constam sent a nurse last night to give me violet rays for my sciatica . And they made me sleep as well , and really when I woke up this morning the sciatica was quite gone and I have n't felt it since , not one bit . "
286652	286819	286643	286643	She	353	" Well , what 's come over him ? He brought me into his precious hotel , and I 'm sure I 've worked for him . And now he .. ! I 'm the best one to tell whether I 'm well enough to work or not . Does he take me for one of those hysterical creatures who 'll go on till they drop , simply because they have n't any sense and they think it 's grand ? If he does , he 's mistaken . Still , he is n't going to make me lose my head . And my tone 's perfect . Last night he was charming , and to - day he 's all nerves . Something else has upset him , and I 'm to bear the brunt of it . All right ! All right ! He 'll recover . But if he thinks he can put me in the wrong and make me play the idiot - "
286820	286825	286826	286826	Evelyn	290	" At any rate , "
286835	286946	286826	286826	Evelyn	290	" there 's one thing you ought to have done . You ought to have seen the doctor before you got up this morning , and obtained his permission . If you have a doctor in , you must show some respect for him . There 's a code , and all sensible people obey it . I wonder what Dr. Constam would have thought if he 'd seen you out of bed - again . I know what he thought when he heard you 'd been out of doors yesterday . A doctor is somebody . You know what savoir vivre means . You have n't been practising it . "
286953	286964	286965	286965	Violet	353	" Dr. Constam might n't have been able to come , "
286968	286973	286826	286826	Evelyn	290	" Did you ask ? "
286974	286981	286826	286826	Evelyn	290	" No , I did n't . "
286982	286986	286826	286826	Evelyn	290	" Well then ! "
286987	286995	286996	286996	she	353	" I did send him a message , "
287001	287127	286996	286996	she	353	" What 's all this about codes and things ? And savoir vivre ? He 's making a fuss over nothing . I 'm well , and here I am! .. He 's trying to be nice . And he 's worth working for . I do wish he 'd stop his lecturing . If this is all he has to say , I might as well go and get on with my business . That day - bed ought to be here soon . He looks at you in a nice way . His smile 's nice . Every now and then he looks a bit like a boy - just for a second . And yet he 's so hard about Mr. Ceria ! "
287177	287182	287183	287183	He	8621	" Now about Ceria . "
287186	287191	287183	287183	He	8621	" Yes , sir ? "
287686	287694	287696	287696	Evelyn	290	" I 'm bound to tell you , "
287698	287822	287696	287696	Evelyn	290	" I think you were wrong yesterday afternoon . As soon as you got Ceria 's letter you ought to have gone straight to Mr. Cousin and told him you knew Ceria was back at home . Your first duty was to the hotel . It is n't even as if you were engaged to Ceria . Personally I do n't think that even that should have made any difference , but I admit the thing might be argued . However , you were n't engaged to him . You refused him , and he was nothing to you . So there was no excuse . I 'm sure you 'll agree with me that it 's best for me to speak plainly . "
287823	287829	287830	287830	she	8642	" Oh yes , sir , "
287835	287848	287830	287830	she	8642	" I much prefer that . Then we know where we are . "
287849	287894	287895	287895	He	8643	" And I must tell you something else . You remember what I said to you last night about Mr. Ceria when you were lying onthat sofa in your room . I abide by it . My opinion has n't changed in the least . "
287901	287912	287895	287895	He	8643	" And I intend to act on what I said . "
287952	287973	287975	287975	Violet	353	" But Mr. Ceria is there to - day , working as usual . And he 's seen Mr. Cousin , "
287978	287983	287987	287991	a cross - examining barrister	8644	" Who told you ? "
287993	288001	287987	287991	a cross - examining barrister	8644	" He did . On the telephone . "
288002	288013	288015	288015	Evelyn	290	" I am aware that he has seen Mr. Cousin , "
288017	288058	288015	288015	Evelyn	290	" But what 's that got to do with it ? Naturally if Ceria comes back he comes back to work . Did you expect Mr. Cousin to prevent him from working ? This hotel has to go on functioning . "
288085	288112	288079	288079	He	290	" And now about Mr. Collifant . Before you gave orders to the people under his control , did you make any attempt to see him ? "
288113	288133	288079	288079	He	290	" No , sir . I was told he was engaged , and as my business was very urgent - "
288134	288316	288317	288317	Evelyn	290	" But was it very urgent ? Even if you 'd been kept half an hour , would that have mattered ? This hotel would n't come to a standstill because of half an hour 's delay in supplying an article that nobody had ever heard of before . And you would n't have been kept . Mr. Collifant was only engaged with Mr. Cousin , and if Mr. Cousin had had the slightest idea that Mr. Collifant was wanted on urgent business he would have understood at once , and perhaps helped too . It is n't as if you did n't know all about the chain of authority . The chain of authority works upwards as well as down . Suppose someone came along and gave orders to one of your floor - housekeepers without a word to you , what would you think ? As a result of your interference Mr. Collifant has given me notice . I have n't accepted his notice , but I may have to . Now Mr. Collifant is a very good man . "
288321	288549	288550	288550	He	8645	" It 's true I went to Craven Street intending to have a row with Collifant myself , but she does n't know that and it 's got nothing to do with her . It is n't true that he 's a very good man , and I do n't care so much if he does leave ; but he 's good in some ways , and anyhow I 'm not going to have a lot of women spreading themselves and upsetting men so that they give notice . I 'm being very effective with her because I 'm talking to her so quietly and reasonably ; but I 'm being firm too , and I shall go on being firm . I can see she 's calming down a bit . Now with a girl like Gracie you never knew . It 's quite on the cards she 'll treat Cheddar as she 's treated me , and write to me and ask me to forgive her . But I sha n't . What is off is off - with me . No , I would n't make it up . And if she came over here to vamp me - she might - well , I do n't know . She has points . It 's possible I could tame her . Oh , damn ! "
288555	288564	288550	288550	He	8645	" You see my point , Miss Powler ? "
288565	288570	288571	288571	Violet	353	" Yes , sir , "
288578	288735	288575	288575	She	353	" But he does n't give me a word of thanks for what I did . I have got the day - bed for them , and nobody else would have got it . I do get things done . But he says nothing about that . Oh no ! No encouragement to do your best in this place . It 's all codes and rules - red tape . Why did he edge away from the subject of Ceria so quick ? I must have Ceria cleared up . I told Ceria positively I 'd spoken to Mr. Orcham and everything would be all right . Positively . He must let Ceria alone now he 's come back . Ceria 's seen Mr. Cousin and he 's working and I told him everything would be all right . Ca n't the Director see reason ? He simply must see reason . If he does n't - "
288796	288853	288793	288793	she	8646	" I 'll be calm and cool . He 's excited himself . You can hear it in his voice . He 's only trying to be collected . He 's pretending , with his nine hotels . But I do n't care if he 's boss of nine hundred hotels - he must see reason . "
288859	288973	288974	288974	He	8647	" You know , more tact , more discretion is needed in your work than you appear to realise , Miss Powler . For instance , there 's your trouble with Mr. Purkin . However , I 'll leave that for the present . But I must remind you , though I 've never mentioned it before , that you did n't succeed in keeping the peace with either Miss Venables or Miss Prentiss . Both very good in their way . You were put over them , and you could n't keep the peace . I do n't say you did n't try . All I say is you did n't succeed . "
288978	289012	288974	288974	He	8647	" I always thought she had plenty of tact . That was why I brought her here . And now I 'm accusing her of no tact . Well , there it is ! "
289031	289056	289028	289028	She	353	" Never mind . All this is nothing . Ceria 's the only thing that matters . I wo n't let him upset me . "
289073	289105	289070	289070	She	353	" But , really , sir , the trouble with Miss Venables and Miss Prentiss began with Miss Maclaren . They were jealous . And anyone could understand their being jealous . "
289106	289112	289114	289114	Evelyn	290	" Yes , of course , "
289116	289133	289114	289114	Evelyn	290	" But Miss Maclaren was sickening for her illness . And as for their being jealous - "
289134	289144	289145	289145	she	353	" And they were still more jealous of me , "
289149	289293	289294	289294	He	8649	" As I was saying , of course they were jealous . It was natural . But do n't you know that jealousy is a very common thing indeed in this place ? I 'm always meeting with it and having to deal with it . And Mr. Cousin too . When we choose a head - housekeeper , even temporarily , we choose her partly because we believe she 'll be capable of dealing satisfactorily with such ordinary little things as jealousy . We do n't imagine there wo n't be any jealousy and the machine will always run smoothly . We know it wo n't . If it did there would n't be any need for tact and so on . Anyone can be tactful when there 's nothing to be tactful about . That is so , is n't it ? "
289297	289322	289444	289444	Evelyn	290	" And hang it ! Am I being tactful now ? Or not ? This ought surely to be a lesson to the girl . "
289323	289328	289329	289329	Violet	353	" Yes , sir , "
289335	289340	289329	289329	Violet	353	" I 'm sorry . "
289344	289377	289341	289341	She	353	" But you have n't lost Venables - you 've got her at the Majestic . And as for Prentiss , she 's a good riddance , and well you know it ! "
289386	289395	289382	289382	she	353	" And what about Mr. Ceria , sir ? "
289396	289403	289404	289404	He	8649	" Why ? What about Ceria ? "
289407	289418	289404	289404	He	8649	" What the devil has Ceria to do with her ? "
289419	289443	289382	289382	she	353	" What are you going to do about him , sir ? You 'll excuse me asking , but I feel rather responsible . "
289447	289484	289485	289485	He	8649	" Well , I 'm dashed ! Does she think she ought to take a hand in running this hotel ? However , I 've calmed her down . Now 's the time to be firm . "
289497	289538	289539	289539	He	8649	" I 've told you I have n't changed since last night . And I do n't see that you 're responsible - in the least . And even if you were - the managerial policy of this hotel remains . "
289542	289587	289539	289539	He	8649	" Yes , I 'm being hard on Ceria , and all the grill - room staff will be against me . Perhaps I ought n't to sack him ; but I 've said it , and I shall stick to it . Must ! "
289637	289647	289648	289648	Violet	353	" Well , I think it 's very unfair , "
289760	289764	289765	289765	he	290	" Now please , "
289768	289773	289765	289765	he	290	" Please do n't - "
289821	289837	289802	289802	Her	353	" She 's not so bad looking . She 's magnificent . She 's beautiful . "
289866	289911	289857	289857	his	290	" Damn these women ! They 're all alike . All . I had an idea she was n't like the rest . But she is . She is n't the girl I took her for . She 's somebody else . Damn her ! "
289944	290051	289936	289937	Miss Cass	336	" Last night I spoke the truth , Mr. Orcham . I do n't know why , except that I wanted to be honest with you . It was wasted . I might have told you the tale that I told to Mr. Fontenay to - day , and you 'd have believed it . And I wish to God I had ! Everything would have been all right then . But I told you the truth . And you 've taken advantage of it . I say it 's very unfair , but it 's worse than that . It 's simply frightful . Frightful ! "
290267	290271	290272	290272	he	8658	" Miss Powler , "
290276	290286	290272	290272	he	8658	" will you oblige me by leaving the room ? "
290287	290290	290291	290291	she	464	" Yes , "
290294	290337	290338	290338	She	464	" I will . And please take my notice to leave , Mr. Orcham . You would n't take Mr. Collifant 's , but you 'll take mine . It wo n't matter to you . I 'm only ' temporary ' . "
290352	290461	290341	290341	He	8658	" This wo n't do . This is absurd . Tact ! Tact ! I 'm cleverer than she is . I brought her into the hotel , and it would never do for me to let her go after a row . There 'd be too much talk . Besides , she 's a first - rate housekeeper , and they 're rare . She 's rather marvellous in a temper . I had n't a notion of it . Though she is awful ! Mrs. O'Riordan was nothing compared to her . No , nor Gracie . She 's kissing Leo Cheddar before dinner . Tact ! "
290503	290508	290500	290500	He	8658	" Please sit down . "
290515	290519	290500	290500	He	8658	" Sit down . "
290605	290609	290610	290610	he	8658	" Miss Powler , "
290615	290699	290610	290610	he	8658	" people like you and me ca n't behave in this style . It 's not worthy of us . And really you ca n't give me notice all in a minute because I do n't manage my hotel as you think I ought to . It 's not right . Now I want to suggest to you that you withdraw your notice , and let 's forget this . You may think quite differently to - morrow . And perhaps I shall . "
290703	290707	290709	290709	Violet	353	" Very well , "
290711	290717	290709	290709	Violet	353	" I withdraw my notice . "
290718	290737	290610	290610	he	8658	" Thank you . I admire you for doing that . It 's what I expected from you . "
290746	290749	290750	290750	she	353	" But , "
290760	290779	290750	290750	she	353	" when you say you may think differently to - morrow , do you mean about Mr. Ceria ? "
290780	290791	290792	290792	Evelyn	290	" I make no promise . I can promise nothing , "
290799	290828	290796	290796	Violet	353	" I 'll stay on . I 'll do my best for the hotel . But things can never be the same between us again . Good afternoon . "
292259	292271	292278	292278	he	414	" I 'm damned if I do n't try a gridiron ! "
292297	292318	292285	292285	Everybody	9637	" The old man 's getting past it . He wo n't be Chairman of the new Board for long . "
292319	292326	292327	292328	Sir Henry	296	" But , my dear Dover ! "
292332	292354	292327	292328	Sir Henry	296	" Let me find you another easy - chair . Let me telephone to Miss Powler . She 'll discover one . "
292355	292369	292371	292372	old Dennis	414	" You may be able to sell pink for blue , my lad , "
292379	292406	292371	292372	old Dennis	414	" but you wo n't find what I call an easy - chair in this hotel . I ought to know . Who 's Miss Powler ? "
292407	292412	292413	292413	Savott	296	" Head - housekeeper . "
292422	292438	292413	292413	Savott	296	" Oh ! Her ! Never set eyes on her . Do n't know her . "
292439	292444	292446	292447	Sir Henry	296	" But I do , "
292450	292461	292446	292447	Sir Henry	296	" May I use your telephone , my dear Chairman ? "
292504	292509	292496	292496	Violet	353	" The Hotel - keeper "
292551	292580	292528	292530	dashed young Agatha	489	" Please , they 've telephoned for you to go up to Mr. Dennis Dover 's room at once . It was Sir Henry Savott who ' phoned . "
292607	292613	292593	292593	her	9790	" The Hotel - keeper , "
293913	293917	293909	293909	She	353	" Come in . "
294059	294063	294065	294066	Sir Henry	296	" Miss Powler , "
294071	294088	294065	294066	Sir Henry	296	" you know the suite my daughter had here last year - I forget the number . "
294089	294092	294093	294093	she	353	" 365 , "
294139	294158	294159	294160	Sir Henry	296	" By the way , you 'll be interested to hear that my daughter is expecting a baby . "
294184	294190	294192	294192	Violet	353	" I 'm so glad ! "
294227	294259	294282	294282	he	296	" Yes , I shall tell her I 've told you and how pleased you are ! Well , in the bedroom there was a peculiar sort of easy - chair . "
294260	294268	294282	294282	he	296	" I know the one you mean . "
294269	294280	294282	294282	he	296	" Could you get it for us ? This one here "
294288	294310	294282	294282	he	296	" does n't suit Mr. Dover , and I think that that one would . Could you get it for us ? "
294336	294342	294328	294328	he	296	" Certainly , Sir Henry . "
294343	294346	294282	294282	he	296	" Now ? "
294347	294350	294328	294328	he	296	" Certainly . "
294351	294355	294282	294282	he	296	" Thank you . "
294574	294577	294578	294578	she	353	" Here ! "
294584	294624	294578	294578	she	353	" Pull that easy - chair out , will you , and take it upstairs in the lift to Mr. Dover 's sitting - room . Get Fred to help you . I 'll be up there before you . "
294654	294686	294642	294648	a magnificent dame in full street attire	8829	" Excuse me , my lady . This chair has to be repaired . I will see that you have another one at once . I thought there was nobody in . "
294721	294736	294737	294737	she	353	" This is the chair you meant , is n't it , Sir Henry ? "
295021	295089	295016	295016	Evelyn	290	" What has all that to do with managing hotels ? There is n't a soul on the Board who knows the first thing about hotels , except Smiss and me . I would n't put sixpence on any of the foreign directors . Except Smiss and me all of them are manipulators of finance , parasites on the industry , perhaps necessary parasites , but parasites . "
295306	295320	295298	295298	Savott	297	" Darling daddy , I 'm going to have a baby . Gracie . "
295692	295698	295699	295701	the teetotal millionaire	8876	" Well , my friend , "
295705	295729	295699	295701	the teetotal millionaire	8876	" You 've made the profit - you 've skinned me alive with these damned bills of yours - but I 've won . "
295772	295775	295777	295777	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
295779	295795	295777	295777	Evelyn	290	" I have my shareholders to think of ... So you think you 'll win ? "
295796	295812	295814	295822	the snowy , shaggy , cold - eyed disputant	8878	" I do n't think . I know . And so do you , sir , "
295824	296061	295814	295822	the snowy , shaggy , cold - eyed disputant	8878	" I 've been reading reports of Parliamentary Commissions for sixty years , and they 're always sitting on fences and weighing pros and cons in a balance . The present gang of hair - splitters will make a lot of recommendations with a lot of reserves , and the result wo n't be worth a fig to you . And even if they gave you everything you 'd get nothing , because nobody will read the Report , and no party will touch it . Too dangerous for vote - catchers to meddle with . It will be postponed again and again until it falls to bits . It will be in every King 's Speech for half a century , and then it just wo n't be . I 'll tell you something - you 'll soon be old enough to learn things . They say that what England stands for is justice . Infernal nonsense ! English justice be hanged . What England stands for is the status quo . And that 's what I stand for , and that 's what you 've been up against . But you 've put up a good fight , Orcham . I 've smashed you to smithereens , but I like ye . I 'm leaving this afternoon . Come in and say good - bye to Lady Levering . Women love good - byes . "
296086	296101	296081	296082	the panjandrum	3408	" He said I knew he would win . And I daresay I did . "
296184	296204	296179	296180	a woman	9588	" Do n't forget to put that in the bedroom you took the other one from - at once . "
296210	296216	296217	296217	he	608	" What 's all this ? "
296220	296226	296230	296231	the valets	11228	" Miss Powler , sir , "
296271	296280	296281	296281	she	353	" Oh , good morning , Mr. Orcham , "
296917	296930	296931	296931	Violet	353	" Is that any better , do you think , Mr. Dover ? "
296939	296964	296934	296935	Father Dennis	414	" I 'll say this . It 's not worse than the other torture - rack . Yes , I believe it is better . "
296965	297008	296934	296935	Father Dennis	414	" It seems better for the small of your back . But if it is n't I 'll have the back re - stuffed for you to - day . I 'll have it done in the workshop here , Mr. Dover . "
297009	297017	297018	297019	Mr. Dover	399	" Yes . You 're very kind , "
297024	297042	297043	297043	He	399	" And while it 's being done I am to lie on the floor , I suppose . "
297056	297074	297045	297045	his	399	" Oh ! Mr. Dover . I 'll promise to find you something softer than the floor . "
297114	297121	297122	297123	father Dennis	414	" I think it 'll do , "
297147	297157	297158	297158	she	353	" It is n't easy to tell right away , "
297161	297187	297158	297158	she	353	" If it is n't just what it ought to be , will you get someone to telephone me , and I 'll come up . "
297188	297196	297197	297198	Lord Watlington	379	" A cushion would do , anyhow , "
297203	297209	297211	297211	Violet	353	" Only women like cushions , "
297243	297251	297253	297253	Violet	353	" Good morning then , Mr. Dover , "
297255	297270	297253	297253	Violet	353	" If I do n't hear I shall take it it 's all right . "
297271	297278	297279	297280	father Dennis	414	" Thank you , my dear , "
297305	297308	297309	297310	father Dennis	414	" Evelyn , "
297313	297325	297309	297310	father Dennis	414	" is that the young woman you took from the Laundry ? "
297326	297331	297279	297280	father Dennis	414	" Yes . Why ? "
297332	297354	297309	297310	father Dennis	414	" Nothing . Only she 's so damned like a lady , nobody could tell the difference . I could n't . "
297355	297368	297370	297370	Evelyn	290	" Her father 's a town - traveller - in proprietary foods , "
297373	297381	297309	297310	father Dennis	414	" Married above him , I expect . "
297382	297391	297309	297310	father Dennis	414	" No . I 've seen them both . "
297396	297420	297392	297393	Father Dennis	414	" Then he may be one of those nature 's gentlemen you hear so much about . I 've never met one myself . "
297421	297424	297426	297427	Mr. Harbour	629	" Why ! "
297429	297454	297426	297427	Mr. Harbour	629	" I said to my wife when she came in to see us before we left for the Majestic last time - you remember - "
297464	297478	297455	297458	the cigarette - king	8341	" I said to Mrs. Harbour that she 'd be an asset anywhere . "
297479	297482	297483	297483	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
297501	297526	297487	297488	Lord Watlington	379	" I can buy the Splendide at Brussels for a million francs . I stayed there two nights last week . What about it ? "
297527	297533	297535	297536	Sir Henry	296	" But it was sold , "
297538	297553	297487	297488	Lord Watlington	379	" I know that . It 's for sale again . That 's all . "
297554	297566	297568	297568	Evelyn	290	" Is n't that enough to make us not want it ? "
297650	297667	297641	297641	he	379	" But listen here , Evelyn . It was you who spoke to Henry about it . "
297668	297681	297641	297641	he	379	" Yes . But I heard things afterwards that put me off . "
297700	297720	297722	297723	Sir Henry	296	" We 've just had a ' phone message to say that the lists have been closed , Evelyn , "
297725	297731	297732	297732	Evelyn	290	" I had one too , "
297758	297778	297755	297755	He	290	" And I am told that letters of allotment will open at a premium of one and a half . "
297779	297785	297755	297755	He	290	" Who 's the prophet ? "
297786	297823	297755	297755	He	290	" Immerson . Not that he 'd agree he 's a prophet . He says he knows . And I bet he does . He 's very much in with one or two Stock Exchange clerks . "
297968	297973	297974	297975	Lord Watlington	379	" Say , Evelyn ! "
297995	298009	297974	297975	Lord Watlington	379	" What did you hear about the Splendide to put you off it ? "
298035	298045	298047	298048	father Dennis	399	" Let us go down and have some lunch , "
298096	298107	298092	298093	Lord Watlington	379	" Ca n't lunch . I 've got to go . "
298486	298491	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" Sensations and Ideas . "
298492	298495	298497	298497	he	372	" Hello ! "
298507	298512	298497	298497	he	372	" What 's this ? "
298518	298552	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" There 's no name to it , Mr. Orcham . But it 's by Sir Henry Savott 's daughter , Mrs. Cheddar . That 's why I 've got a few copies . "
298553	298556	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! "
298565	298575	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" Who told you it 's by Mrs. Cheddar ? "
298576	298590	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" The publisher 's traveller , sir . He called here on purpose . "
298591	298598	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" And do you tell everyone ? "
298599	298607	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" Well , not everyone , sir . "
298608	298614	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" Any demand for it ? "
298615	298627	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" Some , sir . Miss Powler bought a copy yesterday . "
298628	298655	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" Did she ! I may as well tell you you ca n't sell a copy to me - I 've read it . Have you ? "
298656	298661	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" Yes , sir . "
298662	298671	298558	298558	Evelyn	290	" And what do you think of it ? "
298672	298714	298513	298514	The clerk	4246	" Well , sir , between ourselves I do n't really believe there 's much chance for it . It 's rather queer . Some people wo n't quite like it . I have to be very careful in recommending it . "
298715	298720	298722	298722	Evelyn	290	" That 's right , "
298782	298796	298778	298778	he	290	" I 've read it . I do n't want to buy it . "
298956	298964	298953	298953	he	290	" Private . From Miss Violet Powler . "
299057	299073	299050	299050	He	290	" It must have cost the excellent Cass something pretty stiff not to open this ! "
299074	299116	299050	299050	He	290	" DEAR MR . ORCHAM . I feel I should apologise to you for my behaviour in your office last January . I ought to have apologised before . Please accept my sincere excuses . Yours respectfully , V. M. POWLER . "
299117	299122	299123	299123	he	290	" Dash the girl ! "
299126	299172	299123	299123	he	290	" I did n't want her to apologise ! I hate being apologised to ! Who 'd take any notice of anything said by a woman in a temper ? Dash the girl ! And why the devil does she sign ' Yours respectfully ' ? "
299186	299195	299196	299196	Evelyn	290	" Is that Malpass ? The Director speaking . "
299214	299219	299224	299224	Malpass	653	" Yes , sir , "
299269	299280	299265	299268	the Reception - manager	1393	" Have you got the key of the bookstall cupboard ? "
299281	299286	299265	299268	the Reception - manager	1393	" Yes , sir . "
299287	299336	299265	299268	the Reception - manager	1393	" Just open it . You 'll see a book with a funny cover called ' Sensations and Ideas . ' Send it up to my room by the liftman , will you ? And be sure to put a check - slip for it in the cupboard . "
299337	299342	299265	299268	the Reception - manager	1393	" Certainly , sir . "
300022	300035	300017	300017	He	290	" Then why am I out here ? I 'll go back . "
300107	300111	300112	300112	he	290	" My God ! "
300115	300123	300112	300112	he	290	" If that man has a wife ! "
300708	300715	300681	300681	She	353	" Good morning , Miss Powler . "
300716	300724	300725	300725	She	353	" Oh , good morning , sir . "
300738	300745	300681	300681	She	353	" You 're up very early . "
300746	300787	300681	300681	She	353	" No , sir . This is one of my early mornings , and once a week I come and take a look at the ground - floor , before the cleaners arrive - it would be too late afterwards . "
300788	300796	300798	300798	Evelyn	290	" I have a letter for you , "
300817	300825	300681	300681	She	353	" Am I to read it now ? "
300833	300837	300838	300838	he	290	" Why not ? "
300848	300852	300838	300838	he	290	" Any time , "
300911	300932	300906	300906	she	353	" DEAR MISS POWLER . Thank you for your note . I appreciate it . Sincerely yours , EVELYN ORCHAM . "
300947	300953	300955	300955	Violet	353	" Thank you so much , "
300962	300971	300955	300955	Violet	353	" You 're very kind , Mr. Orcham . "
300977	300985	300986	300986	She	353	" Will you excuse me one second ? "
301035	301057	301025	301025	she	353	" If you can possibly wait a few minutes I 've ordered some tea for you from the grill - room . "
301058	301062	301063	301063	he	290	" But why ? "
301147	301159	301160	301160	she	353	" It struck me you look a little tired , sir , "
301168	301182	301160	301160	she	353	" And I thought some tea - if you had n't had any - "
301183	301190	301191	301191	he	290	" I am a bit tired , "
301211	301222	301202	301202	He	290	" Perhaps you did n't sleep very well , sir ? "
301233	301246	301202	301202	He	290	" I did n't . I suppose you 've heard the news ? "
301247	301259	301202	301202	He	290	" No , sir . I 've only just come down . "
301260	301273	301202	301202	He	290	" Willingford shot himself last night - or rather early this morning . "
301274	301277	301202	301202	He	290	" Willingford ? "
301278	301292	301293	301293	He	290	" Manager of the Duncannon . On the very day of our flotation . "
301324	301329	301330	301330	Violet	353	" What a pity ! "
301342	301345	301347	301347	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
301349	301408	301347	301347	Evelyn	290	" Of course I 'm very sorry for him , because he was a very decent fellow , and he 'd had a lot to put up with . But that he should have been driven to do it just now ... Most unfortunate . Makes a bad impression . It ought n't to , but it will . "
301409	301421	301333	301333	her	353	" Had it anything to do with the new big Company ? "
301422	301425	301427	301427	Evelyn	290	" No . "
301432	301449	301427	301427	Evelyn	290	" Well , it had and it had n't . You see it was like this . "
301470	301715	301459	301459	her	9017	" Willingford was manager , but he had a pretty big block of shares in the old Duncannon Company . His wife was head - housekeeper there . Not a satisfactory arrangement . A manager is n't able to control his wife as well as he could someone not connected with him . It ca n't be done . Still , I believe she used to be rather good . She did n't want the Duncannon to be sold . I daresay Willingford would have given in to her , but he had n't got a controlling interest , so he could n't have stopped the sale anyhow . But I gathered from Willingford himself that she always maintained he could . They 'd had rows , great rows , at intervals all through their married life . She 's a terrific talker - I had to listen to her last night - this morning . And ever since the sale was decided upon their quarrels have been very frequent , and the housekeeping has suffered . I knew that from Willingford - only the day before yesterday . You see she interfered at every step of the business side of our deal . I heard that from Sir Henry Savott and from Mr. Smiss too . Willingford could n't hide it . I thought he looked a bit queer in the eyes last time I saw him , but I 'd no idea - "
301716	301728	301730	301730	Violet	353	" Excuse me , here 's your tea , Mr. Orcham , "
301776	301784	301761	301761	she	353	" May I pour out for you ? "
301785	301817	301818	301818	He	9020	" Yes , do , please . But you 'd better bring a chair and sit down . I 've begun to tell you , and I may as well finish . "
301889	301899	301900	301900	he	9020	" Yes , please . This morning . One , "
302037	302043	302044	302044	Violet	353	" When did it happen ? "
302047	302073	302044	302044	Violet	353	" They got me out of bed at ten minutes to one . I went over to the Royal London as quick as I could . "
302074	302079	302011	302011	her	353	" The Royal London ? "
302080	302170	302171	302171	Evelyn	290	" Yes . I must tell you he did n't do it at the Duncannon . He went to the Royal London to do it . All that 's very strange . Very strange . But I can understand it . It was the poor fellow 's last thought for the Duncannon . He knew well enough how bad a suicide is for a hotel . So he went to the Royal London . He always had his knife into the Royal London - I do n't know why . "
302175	302428	302171	302171	Evelyn	290	" Of course it 's quite bad enough for the Duncannon as it is , but it would have been much worse if he 'd shot himself there . It wo n't do the Royal London any good . That must be why he chose the Royal London . Very strange . You never know what is in the mind of a man who has decided to commit suicide . But he meant well by the Duncannon . He did it in the London lounge . Nobody was there . The night - porter heard the shot . I saw him lying on the carpet . There was a policeman there by that time , and the night - porter and the manager . They would n't let anyone else in . The doctor had n't come . They could n't get hold of one . So I telephoned for Constam . But the man was dead all right . Blood on his face . He was all crumpled up . The most forlorn thing you ever saw . It was so pathetic you could hardly bear to look at it . I was awfully glad you could n't hear their orchestra playing , though it was playing . I could hear it from the hall plain enough . Of course they could n't stop the orchestra . That would n't have done at all . And there he was , lying there . He looked very small , all shrunk up . "
302439	302456	302436	302436	She	353	" It reminds you of that piece in Mrs. Cheddar 's book . The motor accident . "
302457	302466	302436	302436	She	353	" Oh ! You 've been reading that ? "
302467	302477	302436	302436	She	353	" I was reading it last night in bed . "
302546	302562	302858	302858	Violet	353	" I 've read it too . A pretty good description , is n't it ? "
302563	302567	302568	302568	Violet	353	" It is , "
302571	302579	302568	302568	Violet	353	" And her thoughts about it afterwards . "
302580	302589	302858	302858	Violet	353	" Yes . You like the book then ? "
302590	302647	302568	302568	Violet	353	" I do n't think I 've ever read anything as wonderful . It 's all so new . But then of course I have n't done a great deal of reading . I only got the book because it was by her . But she was always wonderful , Miss Gracie was - Mrs. Cheddar . "
302648	302651	302653	302653	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
302668	302857	302568	302568	Violet	353	" When Mrs. Willingford came , not long after me , they tried to keep her out of the lounge , but they could n't do it . She made such a noise she 'd have brought everyone in the hotel down to the lounge to see what was the matter . So they let her in . Naturally I was her dear husband 's murderer and so on . But she knew well enough who it was had driven him to suicide ; you could see that from the self - conscious look in her face . So I had to be the murderer . She must be about fifty , but she turned on me like a prize - fighter out of his senses , and the policeman and the manager had all they could do to keep her off me . It was a simply awful scene . I wo n't go into details . And him lying there under her feet all the time ! Still , I must say I felt sorry for her . You could n't help feeling sorry for her . "
302871	302887	302858	302858	Violet	353	" It was frightful for you . Frightful ! May I give you another cup ? "
302888	303228	302858	302858	Violet	353	" It was fairly bad . However , when Constam arrived , and just after him the other doctor they 'd been trying to get , the two of them had her taken off to a nursing - home somewhere , and they 'll see she does n't get out of there in a hurry . Anyhow not till she 's calmed down . She 'll have to attend the inquest , if she 's fit . And I expect I shall too . But she 'll behave herself at the inquest . They always do , for their own sakes . As soon as I could leave I went to the Duncannon and gave a few orders . I said she was n't on any account to be admitted . Perhaps you do n't know what sort of a place the Duncannon is . It is n't at all like the Palace , I can tell you that . Here they 'd treat a suicide case as rather interesting and picturesque . They 'd be shocked , some of 'em , but not too much . But the Duncannon is very English - you know , official , services , lieutenant - governors , and that kind of thing . The waiters are English . It is n't a bit cosmopolitan . And they want quiet decorum before everything . Does n't matter so much about the food . Curries and things . It is n't very smart to look at ; but it 's dignified . You understand . No band except during dinner . If there was dancing they 'd do the lancers and the polka . Anything in the nature of a scandal would horrify them . They 'll all pretend to themselves that the trouble had something to do with the Royal London , which they think 's a bit fast . Not that it is , really . There is n't a fast hotel in London outside Jermyn Street , and even there - "
303330	303347	303348	303348	He	290	" She 's a better judge of a book than that ass of a bookstall clerk . "
303352	303451	303348	303348	He	290	" I 've decided to put Pozzi in charge of the Duncannon for the present . He is n't English , but he need n't show himself much . I must speak to Mr. Cousin . He 'll have seen it in the papers before I see him . At least I hope he will . I do n't precisely feel like beginning the story all over again . That 's the worst of it . There 's about ten people in this place who 'll consider themselves entitled to hear the whole story first hand from me . "
303452	303464	303465	303465	Violet	353	" Perhaps you could put Dr. Constam on to telling them , "
303471	303477	303468	303468	Evelyn	290	" She understands my nerves . "
303478	303485	303486	303486	Violet	353	" But what about the housekeeping ? "
303489	303517	303486	303486	Violet	353	" If Mrs. Willingford is n't there ? And of course everyone will be in a dreadful state and nobody will know quite what they 're doing . "
303518	303521	303523	303523	Evelyn	290	" Yes , "
303525	303573	303523	303523	Evelyn	290	" What about the housekeeping ? There 's only one under - housekeeper . And if I know anything about Mrs. Willingford 's ways , that under - housekeeper has never been allowed one ounce of responsibility . That 's just it : what about the housekeeping ? "
303574	303587	303589	303589	Violet	353	" I suppose you would n't care for me to go over ? "
303591	303605	303606	303606	He	9037	" What ! And leave us to go to rack and ruin here ! "
303645	303669	303625	303625	he	9037	" I only mean for an hour or two a day until things settle down a little and you know where you are . "
303670	303684	303625	303625	he	9037	" But you could n't leave here . You could n't do both . "
303685	303689	303690	303690	Violet	353	" Why not ? "
303694	303706	303690	303690	Violet	353	" The Palace can run by itself for a little while . "
303711	303740	303690	303690	Violet	353	" And besides , Mrs. Oulsnam is very good . And I could be here at any rate in the evenings , and a bit in the afternoons . "
303741	303752	303625	303625	he	9037	" But you do n't know anything about the Duncannon ! "
303753	303776	303778	303778	Violet	353	" I should know a lot more about it than I knew about the Palace when you put me in charge here , "
303782	303789	303790	303790	Evelyn	290	" How soon could you go ? "
303794	303800	303625	303625	he	9037	" I could go now . "
303801	303809	303625	303625	he	9037	" Now ? Do you mean now ? "
303810	303868	303869	303869	Violet	353	" Yes . Before visitors are up . And if you could get Mr. Pozzi as well . And if you could come with us , just to introduce us . You need n't stay long . I 'm sure the doctor would say you ought to have a sedative and go to bed , Mr. Orcham . "
303873	303876	303878	303878	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
303880	303902	303878	303878	Evelyn	290	" this young woman is the goods . She 's too managing with her sedatives , but she 's the goods . "
303907	303940	303903	303903	He	9038	" D'you know what you are , Miss Powler ? You 're the willing horse . You know what happens to the willing horse . You 'd better look out for yourself . "
303941	303948	303949	303949	she	353	" That will be all right , "
304100	304133	304135	304135	Violet	353	" It 's all so awful it seems as if it would go on being awful for ever . But these awful things are soon forgotten . I 've often noticed it , "
304147	304154	304155	304155	he	9038	" Yes . That 's true , "
304167	304191	304155	304155	he	9038	" And supposing that woman , the widow , manages to get into the Duncannon after all , and she comes across you ? "
304192	304203	304204	304204	she	353	" Oh ! I think I could deal with her , "
304905	304916	304899	304901	the critical Violet	353	" Am I such a pleasant change from his wife ? "
305261	305296	305252	305252	Violet	353	" Why are n't you in bed ? You know you ought to be . You know you ca n't possibly be in trim for to - morrow - and tomorrow 's Monday too ! "
305297	305345	305252	305252	Violet	353	" I was in bed , Miss Powler . But I had to get up again because I 'd forgotten to tell you something . Mr. Orcham was asking for you to - night . He came up here , and he told me to tell you . "
305346	305366	305369	305369	her	353	" And could n't that have waited till to - morrow morning ? Run along back to bed now . "
305376	305389	305371	305371	Violet	353	" That 's rather a nice dressing - gown you 've got . "
305390	305403	305252	305252	Violet	353	" Is it? ... Your fire 's out . Did you know ? "
305404	305408	305371	305371	Violet	353	" Run along ! "
305409	305415	305252	305252	Violet	353	" Good night , miss . "
305926	305930	305931	305931	she	353	" Come in , "
306067	306140	306141	306141	He	9966	" So you 've been down to your mother 's and came back late , and now you 're working , and it 's after half - past eleven and you ought to have been in bed long since . How do you expect to be in form for your work to - morrow morning if you sit up like this ? You know you ought never to work on Sunday nights . "
306163	306169	306170	306170	he	9966	" Yes , you laugh , "
306174	306225	306170	306170	he	9966	" Do n't you remember what I said about the willing horse ? I might as well talk to a post . You 're all alike . Miss Cass is just the same . And Miss Tilton too - from what Mr. Cousin tells me . Why are you laughing ? "
306226	306232	306233	306233	Violet	353	" I do n't know , "
306393	306400	306387	306387	She	353	" He is in my room . "
306405	306434	306402	306402	she	353	" I ca n't help showing how pleased I am . Well , I do n't care . It 's rather dark . Perhaps he ca n't see . "
306435	306438	306440	306440	Evelyn	290	" Well , "
306446	306480	306440	306440	Evelyn	290	" I 've been after you all the evening . I should n't have come in now , but I happened to be up here and I saw the light under your door . "
306481	306488	306490	306490	Violet	353	" Happened to be up here ! "
306492	306501	306490	306490	Violet	353	" I wonder what it is he wants . "
306502	306505	306507	306507	Evelyn	290	" Hello ! "
306523	306530	306507	306507	Evelyn	290	" But this is Duncannon stuff ! "
306531	306536	306490	306490	Violet	353	" Yes , sir . "
306537	306577	306507	306507	Evelyn	290	" That 's all wrong , bringing Duncannon stuff over here . If you ca n't attend to it in the time you spend over there , you ought to leave it . Now I wo n't have it . "
306578	306602	306490	306490	Violet	353	" Sometimes it 's easier to do things here . I like to be on the spot in case I 'm asked for . "
306603	306607	306608	306608	He	290	" Oh indeed ! "
306619	306662	306613	306613	he	290	" Mr. Cousin was suggesting you might go to the Duncannon altogether for six months , and get it all absolutely smooth and oiled . He says Mrs. Oulsnam and he between them could carry on here . What do you say ? "
306770	306782	306783	306783	she	9118	" Of course it 's for you to say , sir , "
306789	306805	306806	306806	he	290	" It is n't for me to say . It 's for you to say , "
306809	306876	306783	306783	she	9118	" Well , if you ask me , I do n't think it 's at all necessary for me to live at the Duncannon and leave here . But Mrs. Oulsnam might go . She 's very capable . And she 's so cheerful . The Duncannon does need cheerfulness . She might quite enjoy it . And it would be a step up for her . "
306877	306882	306884	306884	Evelyn	290	" That 's enough ! "
306886	306908	306884	306884	Evelyn	290	" If you do n't want to go , you do n't . As for Mrs. Oulsnam , we 'll see . "
306979	306983	306984	306984	he	290	" Look here ! "
306991	307009	306984	306984	he	290	" If you 'll kindly sit down I might sit down . I detest standing for long . "
307010	307021	306984	306984	he	290	" Oh , please do ! I 'm so sorry . "
307083	307089	307090	307090	he	290	" Your fire 's out , "
307100	307112	307093	307093	Violet	353	" Still , with the radiator the room 's quite warm . "
307113	307121	307123	307123	Violet	353	" May I give you a cigarette ? "
307130	307139	307125	307125	Evelyn	290	" But please smoke if you want to . "
307154	307160	307161	307161	she	353	" I scarcely ever smoke , "
307219	307237	307238	307238	Evelyn	290	" They 're determined to arrange a supper for me . The upper staff , I mean , "
307241	307259	307238	307238	Evelyn	290	" That 's what I 've come to see you about . I must have your opinion . "
307277	307281	307282	307282	she	353	" Oh yes ? "
307288	307795	307260	307260	He	290	" Yes . To - night fortnight it 's supposed to be . It 's a supper of the hotel , to celebrate the success of the Merger . I do n't know why people want to do these things , but they do . And I ca n't say no . Directors and heads of departments - that will be the company . Nobody else - except the manager of the Majestic . Mr. Cousin thought they could n't decently leave him out . Pozzi will come , not so much as manager of the Duncannon as because he 's still in theory assistant - manager here . Old Mr. Dover probably wo n't come down ; he may , but I shall be surprised if he does . Says he feels too old . Of course there 'll be Sir Henry Savot - the supper ought properly to be for him - and Lord Watlington , and Mr. Harbour . And then there 'll be the Directors of the old Company , Mr. Dacker and Mr. Lingmell and Mr. Smiss - Mr. Smiss is a director of the Merger too . And then the heads of departments : Mr. Adolphe , Mr. Immerson , Mr. Jones - Wyatt , Mr. Crump , Mr. Cappone , Mr. Ceria , Commendatore Rocco , Mr. Planquet , Mr. Ruffo , Dr. Constam , Major Linklater , Mr. Exshaw , Mr. Ickeringway , Mr. Stairforth , Mr. Semple , Mr. Pipple - BiIls Department , he 's really cashier . Perhaps that is n't all , but it 's nearly all . There 's about a couple of dozen there anyhow . I 've agreed the list with Mr. Cousin . But do you know what I said ? I said : ' What about ladies ? ' Mr. Cousin said it would n't do to ask the wives . He said we know what the men are like , but if we ask one wife we must ask all , and some of 'em would n't do . You know , people are apt to think the staff of a hotel is all alike . Well , of course it is n't . Class distinctions are as sharp in a hotel - staff as they are elsewhere - sharper perhaps . So Mr. Cousin said his idea was to have men only . Now I do n't think that 's right . If a woman happens to be head of a department she 's just as much entitled to be asked to take part in that supper as any other head of a department . Women work as hard as men , and as a rule they 're nicer to look at , and they have the vote and they sit on juries and even in Parliament , and so why should n't they sit at supper ? I 'm not a fanatical feminist , but I do believe in playing fair . What do you say ? "
307883	307892	307893	307893	she	353	" I think the principle 's quite right , "
307897	307902	307864	307864	His	9139	" Well , then ! "
307903	307914	307864	307864	His	9139	" Let me see , who are the women heads ? "
307915	307920	307864	307864	His	9139	" There 's you . "
307921	307926	307864	307864	His	9139	" But who else ? "
307927	307934	307935	307935	Evelyn	290	" There is n't anybody else , "
307940	307952	307954	307969	the head - housekeeper , whose common sense was after all stronger than any masculine logic	9140	" I should love to come , but not by myself , "
307971	307982	307864	307864	His	9139	" But why not ? Would you be afraid to ? "
307983	308009	307864	307864	His	9139	" I could n't come by myself , Mr. Orcham . But are you sure there is n't anybody else ? What about Mrs. Rowbotham ? "
308010	308081	307864	307864	His	9139	" Works ? Certainly not . By the way , I was forgetting the new head at Craven Street . No , Mrs. Rowbotham is n't a head . And what 's more , she is n't presentable . We might as well ask Skinner ; he considers himself now the greatest man in the entire show . No . Everyone must be presentable - that 's cast - iron . "
308082	308092	307864	307864	His	9139	" Lady Milligan . She 'd adore to come . "
308093	308110	308112	308112	Evelyn	290	" I daresay she would . But she does n't happen to be on the staff , "
308115	308126	307864	307864	His	9139	" But for the sake of old times ? No ? "
308127	308144	307864	307864	His	9139	" The old times when her ladyship ran off and left us . No , thanks . "
308176	308182	307864	307864	His	9139	" Well , Mrs. Oulsnam ? "
308183	308226	308276	308276	he	3408	" She is n't head of a department . If we had her we should either have to ask about twenty more second - in - commands or there 'd be such a flare - up of jealousies as never was seen . "
308227	308259	307864	307864	His	9139	" But if you made her head - housekeeper at the Duncannon , and she sort of belongs here and Mr. Pozzi is coming , could n't you squeeze her in ? "
308260	308266	308267	308268	the panjandrum	3408	" That 's an idea , "
308279	308327	308276	308276	he	3408	" And there 'd be four of you if we roped in Miss Cass and Marian Tilton . Both those two are perfectly convinced that they run the hotel . Yes , four would n't be so bad , would it ? Might even have some dancing . "
308328	308334	308336	308336	Violet	353	" Four would be lovely , "
308338	308350	308352	308352	Evelyn	290	" I 'll see Mr. Cousin first thing to - morrow , "
308360	308373	308375	308375	Violet	353	" It 's awfully nice of you to come and ask me , "
308594	308606	308607	308607	he	3408	" Is n't it about time you had some pictures here ? "
308636	308640	308642	308642	she	353	" It is , "
308644	308660	308642	308642	she	353	" I 've been intending to get some , but I 've been so busy . "
308661	308669	308671	308672	the panjandrum	3408	" We have some good etchings somewhere , "
308674	308743	308671	308672	the panjandrum	3408	" I 'll give you a few . I mean they 're the hotel 's , but that need n't worry us . I 'll ask Miss Cass where they are . I 'll have them sent up to you . And I think these rooms of yours ought to be done up . I suppose visitors come in here sometimes to see you , do n't they ? "
308839	308843	308844	308844	she	353	" Thank you , "
308851	308857	308858	308858	he	3408	" Do n't mention it , "
308903	308918	308900	308900	she	353	" If he presses mine it 's only right for me to press his . "
309112	309118	309119	309119	she	353	" Not to - night , "
309125	309174	309119	309119	she	353	" To - morrow morning , early . I really could n't to - night . Shall I even be able to take my things off and get into bed ? I 'm done in for ever . And I shall never have a moment 's peace again . "
309193	309228	309119	309119	she	353	" I must find time to go up to Shaftesbury Avenue - to - morrow . Something 's bound to want altering , and you never know how long they 'll take over it . "
309507	309533	309494	309495	Miss Cass	336	" Yes , Mr. Orcham . I 'll go at once . By the way , there 's some trouble about that staff - supper . "
309534	309550	309712	309713	the woman	1424	" Never mind the staff - supper . Run off and get that orderto view . "
309551	309557	309559	309562	the indomitable Miss Cass	336	" Certainly , Mr. Orcham , "
309566	309595	309559	309562	the indomitable Miss Cass	336	" But several secretaries , especially Mr. Smiss 's senior secretary , are complaining because they have n't been asked to join in , and Mr. Smiss thinks - "
309596	309661	309712	309713	the woman	1424	" Will you oblige me very much by going instantly for that order to view ? I really can not be bothered with all these ridiculous jealousies when I 'm as busy as I am now . You 've been asked to the supper , and Miss Tilton has been asked , and Mr. Cousin has decided that no other secretaries shall be asked . "
309662	309677	309559	309562	the indomitable Miss Cass	336	" Yes , Mr. Orcham . I only thought you 'd like to know . "
309678	309698	309712	309713	the woman	1424	" Well , I do n't like to know . It 's not I who am giving the supper . "
309699	309705	309712	309713	the woman	1424	" Quite , Mr. Orcham . "
309726	309737	309738	309738	Evelyn	290	" I 'm sick to death of all these women ! "
309761	309777	309748	309748	he	290	" Let 'em go to the devil! .. That supper is n't beginning very auspiciously . "
310264	310269	310261	310261	she	336	" Morning , Evelyn . "
310270	310275	310276	310276	Evelyn	290	" Morning , Henry . "
310286	310304	310276	310276	Evelyn	290	" Sit down . Glad to see you . What 's up ? How are the talkies ? "
310305	310311	310313	310314	Sir Henry	296	" Talkies are going some , "
310342	310365	310403	310403	his	290	" I say . I 've been seeing Smiss . He tells me you 're thinking of taking new offices for Orcham . "
310384	310392	310394	310394	Evelyn	290	" The idea has crossed my mind , "
310406	310419	310394	310394	Evelyn	290	" I expect to submit a proposal at the next Board Meeting . "
310420	310429	310403	310403	his	290	" Do you think it 's quite necessary ? "
310430	310446	310448	310448	Evelyn	290	" I certainly would n't dream of doing anything without submitting it to the Board , "
310455	310464	310465	310466	Sir Henry	567	" I mean , to take special offices , "
310485	310498	310499	310499	he	290	" How else do you expect Orcham is to carry on business ? "
310506	310526	310465	310466	Sir Henry	567	" Well , in a big place like the Palace I should have thought you might have found room - "
310527	310663	310465	310466	Sir Henry	567	" Just listen to me , my dear Henry . The Palace is big because it 's doing a big business . And it is n't too big for its business . And a big place is n't any more elastic than a little place . If you ca n't pour a quart into a pint pot , it 's just as true that you ca n't pour fifteen hundred gallons into a thousand - gallon cistern . Even as it is , the Palace is being very seriously cramped by Orcham work . Why should the Palace be inconvenienced for the advantage of all the other hotels in the group ? I do n't know of any other business that 's run without offices . Proper offices make for efficiency - or ought to . "
310664	310679	310681	310682	Sir Henry	567	" I was thinking of the expense . Someone has to think of it , "
310688	310695	310696	310696	Evelyn	290	" Quite , my dear chap ! "
310700	310795	310696	310696	Evelyn	290	" And I 'm much obliged for the hint . But I 'm doing a certain amount of cerebration over the expense myself . That 's part of my job . Only I feel sure you 'll agree with my maxim that one ca n't have something for nothing . The Orcham staff is n't fully organised yet : the sooner it 's organised the better , and it ca n't be organised until definite offices are organised . Anyhow the decisions will be with the Board . Have a cigar , old man . "
310820	310843	310844	310845	Sir Henry	567	" Not now , thanks , Evelyn . I 'm in a hurry . I just looked in - that 's all . "
310878	310885	310886	310886	Evelyn	290	" Well , thanks very much . "
310893	310906	310886	310886	Evelyn	290	" I shall bear in mind what you say . Au revoir . "
310914	310954	310911	310911	Evelyn	290	" He 's gone off with a flick in his ear . If anybody thinks I 'm not the real Simon Pure boss of this show , he 's wrong . And I do n't care who he is . "
311005	311014	311016	311016	Evelyn	290	" Oh ! Here they are at last ! "
311041	311050	311051	311051	he	3433	" You 'd better come over with me , "
311125	311135	311137	311137	Evelyn	290	" There surely ought to be a caretaker here , "
311154	311160	311161	311162	Miss Cass	336	" It 's Crown property , "
311174	311199	311165	311165	Evelyn	290	" Excuse me , Mr. Orcham . But you told me that Report on the Escurial must be finished in triplicate by twelve o'clock . "
311233	311285	311227	311227	He	290	" Very well , go and get it done . And see you have fresh carbons . Send - er - Miss Powler to me , and ask her to bring a tape - measure with her . I must have someone . And she may be more useful than you . "
311651	311658	311659	311659	she	9227	" I was at the Duncannon , "
311679	311686	311687	311687	she	9227	" Can you pay the taxi ? "
311690	311698	311687	311687	she	9227	" I came away without my bag . "
311715	311718	311719	311719	he	290	" Certainly , "
311825	311849	311807	311807	He	290	" I wanted you to look over this place from the practical point of view and tell me what you think of it . "
312247	312272	312244	312244	She	353	" I ought to soothe him ; he needs soothing . I know I can soothe him , because I 've done it before . "
312389	312396	312398	312398	Evelyn	290	" Just look at that ceiling ! "
312405	312408	312409	312409	she	353	" Yes , "
312412	312415	312409	312409	she	353	" Beautiful . "
312420	312441	312416	312416	She	353	" But you could n't always be craning your neck to look at a ceiling , however beautiful it was . "
312442	312450	312452	312452	Evelyn	290	" This would be the Board Room , "
312454	312457	312458	312458	she	353	" Yes ? "
312461	312484	312458	312458	she	353	" What about the double doors ? Anyone in the back room would hear everything you were saying at the Board meetings . "
312485	312489	312490	312490	he	290	" Oh no ! "
312493	312520	312490	312490	he	290	" Besides , we could do away with those things and continue the wall all across . Quite simple . Lovely fireplaces , are n't they ? "
312521	312524	312525	312525	she	353	" Lovely , "
312528	312563	312525	312525	she	353	" But they 'd never warm these rooms enough in winter . I do n't know how people managed in these old houses in winter . They must have been starved to death sometimes . "
312564	312567	312568	312568	he	290	" Well , "
312572	312589	312568	312568	he	290	" we could soon fix that . Central heating . Of course . Or electric radiators . "
312590	312607	312525	312525	she	353	" There are n't enough switches . You 'd have to re - wire it all . "
312707	312721	312723	312723	Evelyn	290	" Obviously a lot of re - wiring would have to be done , "
312867	312870	312871	312871	he	290	" Well , "
312876	312884	312871	312871	he	290	" we 'll go a bit higher . "
312893	312904	312905	312905	he	290	" I thought I might live myself on this floor , "
312920	312939	312915	312915	he	290	" There 's a splendid bathroom . Come and see it ... How 's that for a bathroom ? "
312940	312949	312950	312950	she	796	" But the kitchen 's in the basement , "
312958	312970	312950	312950	she	796	" And the service - stairs are frightfully narrow and twisty . "
312971	312974	312915	312915	he	290	" Oh ! "
312991	312999	312983	312983	He	290	" Where 's your tape - measure ? "
313000	313011	312915	312915	he	290	" Tape - measure ? I have n't got one . "
313012	313024	312983	312983	He	290	" I told Miss Cass to tell you to bring one . "
313025	313041	312915	312915	he	290	" I 'm sorry . I did n't hear anything about any tape - measure . "
313045	313057	312983	312983	He	290	" Well , we may as well see the top floor . "
313073	313080	313081	313081	Evelyn	290	" These would make excellent offices , "
313086	313109	312983	312983	He	290	" But you 'll want a room for Oldham . To say nothing of a caretaker and a cook and a maid . "
313110	313115	313116	313116	he	9279	" Now look here ! "
313123	313178	313116	313116	he	9279	" I 've got you here to have your opinion . Well , let me have it , straight out . I do n't want all these ' buts . ' You 've said nothing but ' buts ' up to now . Say something positive . You simply do n't like the house . "
313258	313267	313269	313269	Violet	353	" Yes , I do like the house , "
313285	313370	313371	313371	She	353	" But it is n't offices . It would be as if you were trying to make a thing do - for something else . If I was in your place and I wanted offices I should build offices . And fancy the kitchen in the basement and you living up here ! And I do n't think it 'd be a good thing for you to live where you work . I know you do , at the Palace - but - but - "
313559	313568	313569	313569	he	9283	" What am I going to do next ? "
313579	313592	313593	313593	he	9283	" ' But ' - ' but ' - ' but , ' "
313608	313614	313593	313593	he	9283	" You are a dear ! "

314264	314275	314260	314260	She	469	" Not yet , not yet . We 'll see . "
314697	314707	314693	314693	Violet	469	" Oh , dad , this is Mr. Orcham , "
315045	315107	315025	315025	Evelyn	290	" I suppose Miss Powler is n't here , by any chance? .. Oh , she is ! Well , tell her to come down and see me in Mr. Pozzi 's room at once . And to bring those charts that she was showing me this morning at the Palace . She 'll know which I mean . At once . "

316704	316709	316690	316690	He	432	" That 's two . "
316710	316715	316726	316726	he	432	" That 's three . "
316769	316774	316776	316777	Mr. Cousin	334	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
316781	316794	316795	316795	Uncertain	669	" There will be no speeches . You ought to applaud that . "
316798	316809	316810	316811	The revellers	5602	" But I give you the health of our guest . "
316825	316830	316832	316832	Evelyn	290	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
316864	316920	316858	316858	his	432	" I thank you . I 'm not going to forget this supper . Before I sit down I want to propose the health of our Chairman , Mr. Dennis Dover , who would have liked to be here , but is n't well enough to join us . The health of Mr. Dennis Dover . "
316943	316949	316950	316951	Mr. Cousin	334	" C'était chic , ça ! "
317080	317085	317086	317087	Mr. Cousin	334	" You will dance , "
317091	317103	317107	317107	he	334	" Oh , hang it ! Well , if I must . "
317110	317119	317107	317107	he	334	" Who ought I to dance with first ? "
317120	317143	317144	317145	Mr. Cousin	334	" Miss Powler of course , mon cher . She is the most important . Les autres - ça ne compte pas . "

317464	317481	317483	317483	Evelyn	290	" I felt awful while I was on my legs waiting for the acclamations to stop , "
317552	317580	317581	317581	she	353	" You looked so sweet I could scarcely bear to look at you . If it had gone on any longer I should have had to cry , "
317653	317660	317661	317662	Sir Henry	296	" Fine little orchestra , Evelyn ! "
317979	317991	317992	317992	he	290	" Tell me what you 're thinking about , my dear , "
318144	318168	318141	318141	She	353	" I had an awful thought that all these sharp - eyes here are bound to guess there 's something between us two . "
318187	318197	318198	318198	he	9506	" And what if they do ? There is ! "
318714	318721	318723	318723	Evelyn	290	" Do sit here with us , "
318741	318751	318753	318754	Mr. Harbour	629	" It 's a lovely party , Miss Powler , "
318763	318770	318772	318773	Sir Henry	296	" You must have some champagne , "
318775	318780	318772	318773	Sir Henry	296	" Here , waiter . "
318792	318801	318781	318782	The waiters	2447	" I really could n't , Sir Henry . "
318802	318809	318810	318810	he	296	" Oh , but you must , "
318813	318850	318810	318810	he	296	" This evening is an occasion . Champagne wo n't do you any harm . As an indulgence it will do you good . It 's only when it becomes a habit that it harms you . "
318872	318883	318885	318886	Sir Henry	296	" I hear you 've read my daughter 's book , "
318888	318952	318885	318886	Sir Henry	296	" And like it . I 'm glad . But I should have left out bits here and there if I 'd been consulted . Only I was n't . These modern daughters are very secretive , Miss Powler . However , now she 's married and going to have a baby I suppose it does n't matter how modem the book is . "
318966	318987	318988	318988	He	379	" Good night , Evelyn . Good night , everybody . I 'm off . Just had a telephone message . "
319026	319036	319038	319038	he	296	" You 're the finest dancer in this room , "
319040	319048	319038	319038	he	296	" And I 'm not flattering you . "
319129	319134	319135	319135	Violet	353	" I must go , "
319140	319146	319147	319147	he	296	" You 're very tired , "
319154	319163	319147	319147	he	296	" I 'll see you to the lift . "
319198	319210	319211	319211	Violet	353	" Who put them on to that office - building idea ? "
