480	526	473	473	he	35	" Father , I was on the quays even now , and I looked on the ships that were nigh boun , and thy sign I saw on a tall ship that seemed to me nighest boun . Will it be long ere she sail ? "
527	530	532	533	his father	86	" Nay , "
535	564	532	533	his father	86	" that ship , which hight the Katherine , will they warp out of the haven in two days ' time . But why askest thou of her ? "
565	574	576	576	Walter	35	" The shortest word is best , father , "
578	597	576	576	Walter	35	" and this it is , that I would depart in the said ship and see other lands . "
598	605	607	608	the merchant	122	" Yea and whither , son ? "
610	615	617	617	Walter	35	" Whither she goeth , "
619	635	617	617	Walter	35	" for I am ill at ease at home , as thou wottest , father . "
664	685	661	661	he	122	" Well , son , maybe it were best for thee ; but maybe also we shall not meet again . "
686	705	661	661	he	122	" Yet if we do meet , father , then shalt thou see a new man in me . "
706	709	711	711	Bartholomew	36	" Well , "
713	779	711	711	Bartholomew	36	" at least I know on whom to lay the loss of thee , and when thou art gone , for thou shalt have thine own way herein , she shall no longer abide in my house . Nay , but it were for the strife that should arise thenceforth betwixt her kindred and ours , it should go somewhat worse with her than that . "
783	809	781	781	Walter	35	" I pray thee shame her not more than needs must be , lest , so doing , thou shame both me and thyself also . "
823	832	820	820	he	36	" Goeth she with child , my son ? "
839	852	833	833	Walter	35	" I wot not ; nor of whom the child may be . "
865	1017	860	860	Bartholomew	36	" The end of it is , son , that this is Monday , and that thou shalt go aboard in the small hours of Wednesday ; and meanwhile I shall look to it that thou go not away empty - handed ; the skipper of the Katherine is a good man and true , and knows the seas well ; and my servant Robert the Low , who is clerk of the lading , is trustworthy and wise , and as myself in all matters that look towards chaffer . The Katherine is new and stout - builded , and should be lucky , whereas she is under the ward of her who is the saint called upon in the church where thou wert christened , and myself before thee ; and thy mother , and my father and mother all lie under the chancel thereof , as thou wottest . "
2902	2917	2898	2898	he	35	" Arnold , what tidings ? Is all well with the folk at Langton ? "
2921	2956	2919	2919	Arnold	41	" Evil tidings are come with me ; matters are ill with thy folk ; for I may not hide that thy father , Bartholomew Golden , is dead , God rest his soul . "
3045	3072	3034	3034	he	35	" What , Arnold ! and did he die in his bed , or how ? for he was neither old nor ailing when we parted . "
3076	3093	3034	3034	he	35	" Yea , in his bed he died : but first he was somewhat sword- bitten . "
3094	3100	3102	3102	Walter	35	" Yea , and how ? "
3107	3184	3105	3105	Arnold	41	" When thou wert gone , in a few days ' wearing , thy father sent thy wife out of his house back to her kindred of the Reddings with no honour , and yet with no such shame as might have been , without blame to us of those who knew the tale of thee and her ; which , God - a - mercy , will be pretty much the whole of the city . "
3185	3466	3034	3034	he	35	" Nevertheless , the Reddings took it amiss , and would have a mote with us Goldings to talk of booting . By ill - luck we yea - said that for the saving of the city 's peace . But what betid ? We met in our Gild - hall , and there befell the talk between us ; and in that talk certain words could not be hidden , though they were none too seemly nor too meek . And the said words once spoken drew forth the whetted steel ; and there then was the hewing and thrusting ! Two of ours were slain outright on the floor , and four of theirs , and many were hurt on either side . Of these was thy father , for as thou mayst well deem , he was nought backward in the fray ; but despite his hurts , two in the side and one on the arm , he went home on his own feet , and we deemed that we had come to our above . But well - a- way ! it was an evil victory , whereas in ten days he died of his hurts . God have his soul ! But now , my master , thou mayst well wot that I am not come to tell thee this only , but moreover to bear the word of the kindred , to wit that thou come back with me straightway in the swift cutter which hath borne me and the tidings ; and thou mayst look to it , that though she be swift and light , she is a keel full weatherly . "
3471	3499	3469	3469	Walter	35	" This is a bidding of war . Come back will I , and the Reddings shall wot of my coming . Are ye all - boun ? "
3500	3503	3505	3505	Arnold	41	" Yea , "
3507	3567	3505	3505	Arnold	41	" we may up anchor this very day , or to - morrow morn at latest . But what aileth thee , master , that thou starest so wild over my shoulder ? I pray thee take it not so much to heart ! Ever it is the wo nt of fathers to depart this world before their sons . "
3589	3596	3580	3580	he	35	" Look ! dost thou see ? "
3597	3603	3605	3605	Arnold	41	" See what , master ? "
3607	3796	3605	3605	Arnold	41	" what ! here cometh an ape in gay raiment ; belike the beast of some jongleur . Nay , by God 's wounds ! ' tis a man , though he be exceeding mis - shapen like a very devil . Yea and now there cometh a pretty maid going as if she were of his meney ; and lo ! here , a most goodly and noble lady ! Yea , I see ; and doubtless she owneth both the two , and is of the greatest of the folk of this fair city ; for on the maiden 's ankle I saw an iron ring , which betokeneth thralldom amongst these aliens . But this is strange ! for notest thou not how the folk in the street heed not this quaint show ; nay not even the stately lady , though she be as lovely as a goddess of the gentiles , and beareth on her gems that would buy Langton twice over ; surely they must be over- wo nt to strange and gallant sights . But now , master , but now ! "
3797	3804	3806	3806	Walter	35	" Yea , what is it ? "
3808	3843	3806	3806	Walter	35	" Why , master , they should not yet be gone out of eye - shot , yet gone they are . What is become of them , are they sunk into the earth ? "
3844	3849	3851	3851	Walter	35	" Tush , man ! "
3865	3882	3851	3851	Walter	35	" they have gone into some house while thine eyes were turned from them a moment . "
3883	3890	3892	3892	Arnold	41	" Nay , master , nay , "
3894	3906	3892	3892	Arnold	41	" mine eyes were not off them one instant of time . "
3907	3910	3912	3912	Walter	35	" Well , "
3917	4012	3912	3912	Walter	35	" they are gone now , and what have we to do to heed such toys , we with all this grief and strife on our hands ? Now would I be alone to turn the matter of thine errand over in my mind . Meantime do thou tell the shipmaster Geoffrey and our other folk of these tidings , and thereafter get thee all ready ; and come hither to me before sunrise to - morrow , and I shall be ready for my part ; and so sail we back to Langton . "
4597	4620	4593	4593	he	274	" Why should I tell thee what any fool can see without telling , to wit that there is weather to hand ? "
4898	5045	4893	4893	He	274	" Young master , the sele of the day to thee ! For by good hap we have gotten into another day . Now I shall tell thee that we have striven to beat , so as not to be driven off our course , but all would not avail , wherefore for these three hours we have been running before the wind ; but , fair sir , so big hath been the sea that but for our ship being of the stoutest , and our men all yare , we had all grown exceeding wise concerning the ground of the mid - main . Praise be to St. Nicholas and all Hallows ! for though ye shall presently look upon a new sea , and maybe a new land to boot , yet is that better than looking on the ugly things down below . "
5046	5056	5058	5058	Walter	35	" Is all well with ship and crew then ? "
5060	5064	5066	5067	the shipmaster	274	" Yea forsooth , "
5069	5100	5066	5067	the shipmaster	274	" verily the Bartholomew is the darling of Oak Woods ; come up and look at it , how she is dealing with wind and waves all free from fear . "
5250	5275	5235	5236	the shipmaster	274	" Well , shipmate , cheer up ! and now come below again and eat some meat , and drink a cup with me . "
6124	6136	6112	6113	The shipmaster	274	" Old man , art thou the king of this country ? "
6141	6151	6153	6153	he	127	" It hath had none other a long while , "
6155	6170	6153	6153	he	127	" and at least there is no other son of Adam here to gainsay . "
6171	6178	6180	6181	the master	307	" Thou art alone here then ? "
6183	6186	6188	6190	the old man	208	" Yea , "
6223	6223	6225	6226	the master	307	"
6228	6238	6225	6226	the master	307	" Where be the other houses of the town ? "
6247	6304	6245	6245	he	208	" When I said that I was alone , I meant that I was alone in the land and not only alone in this stead . There is no house save this betwixt the sea and the dwellings of the Bears , over the cliff - wall yonder , yea and a long way over it . "
6305	6308	6310	6311	the shipmaster	274	" Yea , "
6314	6332	6310	6311	the shipmaster	274	" and be the bears of thy country so manlike , that they dwell in builded houses ? "
6340	6343	6345	6345	he	208	" Sir , "
6347	6452	6345	6345	he	208	" as to their bodily fashion , it is altogether manlike , save that they be one and all higher and bigger than most . For they be bears only in name ; they be a nation of half wild men ; for I have been told by them that there be many more than that tribe whose folk I have seen , and that they spread wide about behind these mountains from east to west . Now , sir , as to their souls and understandings I warrant them not ; for miscreants they be , trowing neither in God nor his hallows . "
6457	6464	6454	6455	the master	307	" Trow they in Mahound then ? "
6465	6468	6470	6471	the elder	127	" Nay , "
6473	6505	6470	6471	the elder	127	" I wot not for sure that they have so much as a false God ; though I have it from them that they worship a certain woman with mickle worship . "
6510	6530	6508	6508	Walter	35	" Yea , good sir , and how knowest thou that ? dost thou deal with them at all ? "
6536	6724	6532	6534	the old man	208	" Whiles some of that folk come hither and have of me what I can spare ; a calf or two , or a half - dozen of lambs or hoggets ; or a skin of wine or cyder of mine own making : and they give me in return such things as I can use , as skins of hart and bear and other peltries ; for now I am old , I can but little of the hunting hereabout . Whiles , also , they bring little lumps of pure copper , and would give me gold also , but it is of little use in this lonely land . Sooth to say , to me they are not masterful or rough - handed ; but glad am I that they have been here but of late , and are not like to come again this while ; for terrible they are of aspect , and whereas ye be aliens , belike they would not hold their hands from off you ; and moreover ye have weapons and other matters which they would covet sorely . "
6729	6774	6726	6727	the master	307	" Since thou dealest with these wild men , will ye not deal with us in chaffer ? For whereas we are come from long travel , we hanker after fresh victual , and here aboard are many things which were for thine avail . "
6780	7143	6776	6778	the old man	208	" All that I have is yours , so that ye do but leave me enough till my next ingathering : of wine and cyder , such as it is , I have plenty for your service ; ye may drink it till it is all gone , if ye will : a little corn and meal I have , but not much ; yet are ye welcome thereto , since the standing corn in my garth is done blossoming , and I have other meat . Cheeses have I and dried fish ; take what ye will thereof . But as to my neat and sheep , if ye have sore need of any , and will have them , I may not say you nay : but I pray you if ye may do without them , not to take my milch - beasts or their engenderers ; for , as ye have heard me say , the Bear - folk have been here but of late , and they have had of me all I might spare : but now let me tell you , if ye long after flesh - meat , that there is venison of hart and hind , yea , and of buck and doe , to be had on this plain , and about the little woods at the feet of the rock - wall yonder : neither are they exceeding wild ; for since I may not take them , I scare them not , and no other man do they see to hurt them ; for the Bear- folk come straight to my house , and fare straight home thence . But I will lead you the nighest way to where the venison is easiest to be gotten . As to the wares in your ship , if ye will give me aught I will take it with a good will ; and chiefly if ye have a fair knife or two and a roll of linen cloth , that were a good refreshment to me . But in any case what I have to give is free to you and welcome . "
7148	7151	7153	7153	he	274	" Friend , "
7155	7230	7153	7153	he	274	" we can thee mickle thanks for all that thou biddest us . And wot well that we be no lifters or sea - thieves to take thy livelihood from thee . So to - morrow , if thou wilt , we will go with thee and upraise the hunt , and meanwhile we will come aland , and walk on the green grass , and water our ship with thy good fresh water . "
7451	7504	7447	7447	him	376	" Father , meseemeth thou shouldest have some strange tale to tell , and as yet we have asked thee of nought save meat for our bellies : now if I ask thee concerning thy life , and how thou camest hither , and abided here , wilt thou tell me aught ? "
7514	7573	7505	7507	The old man	208	" Son , my tale were long to tell ; and mayhappen concerning much thereof my memory should fail me ; and withal there is grief therein , which I were loth to awaken : nevertheless if thou ask , I will answer as I may , and in any case will tell thee nought save the truth . "
7577	7587	7575	7575	Walter	35	" Well then , hast thou been long here ? "
7588	7591	7593	7594	the carle	376	" Yea , "
7609	7609	7593	7594	the carle	376	"
7613	7652	7611	7611	Walter	35	" This house , didst thou build it , and raise these garths , and plant orchard and vineyard , and gather together the neat and the sheep , or did some other do all this for thee ? "
7657	7700	7654	7655	the carle	376	" I did none of all this ; there was one here before me , and I entered into his inheritance , as though this were a lordly manor , with a fair castle thereon , and all well stocked and plenished . "
7704	7713	7702	7702	Walter	35	" Didst thou find thy foregoer alive here ? "
7714	7717	7719	7720	the elder	127	" Yea , "
7722	7737	7719	7720	the elder	127	" yet he lived but for a little while after I came to him . "
7749	7769	7746	7746	he	127	" I slew him : even so would he have it , though I bade him a better lot . "
7773	7783	7771	7771	Walter	35	" Didst thou come hither of thine own will ? "
7784	7787	7789	7790	the carle	376	" Mayhappen , "
7792	7820	7789	7790	the carle	376	" who knoweth ? Now have I no will to do either this or that . It is wo nt that maketh me do , or refrain . "
7824	7843	7822	7822	Walter	35	" Tell me this ; why didst thou slay the man ? did he any scathe to thee ? "
7848	7910	7845	7846	the elder	127	" When I slew him , I deemed that he was doing me all scathe : but now I know that it was not so . Thus it was : I would needs go where he had been before , and he stood in the path against me ; and I overthrew him , and went on the way I would . "
7911	7916	7918	7918	Walter	35	" What came thereof ? "
7920	7926	7928	7929	the carle	376	" Evil came of it , "
7968	7980	7961	7961	Walter	35	" Was it from hence that thou wouldst go that road ? "
7981	7984	7986	7987	the carle	376	" Yea , "
7992	8029	7990	7990	Walter	35	" And now wilt thou tell me what that road was ; whither it went and whereto it led , that thou must needs wend it , though thy first stride were over a dead man ? "
8030	8037	8039	8040	the carle	376	" I will not tell thee , "
8369	8387	8365	8366	the carle	376	" What ! thou hast found something before thee to look on . What is it then ? "
8391	8420	8389	8389	Walter	35	" Some would say that where yonder slopes run together up towards that sinking in the cliff - wall there will be a pass into the country beyond . "
8427	8463	8421	8422	The carle	376	" Yea , son ; nor , so saying , would they err ; for that is the pass into the Bear - country , whereby those huge men come down to chaffer with me . "
8464	8467	8469	8469	Walter	35	" Yea , "
8585	8609	8611	8611	he	35	" Lo , old friend , there yonder is again a place that meseemeth is a pass ; whereunto doth that one lead ? "
8643	8673	8617	8619	the old man	208	" Maybe : I wot not . I deem that it also leadeth into the Bear - country by a roundabout road . It leadeth into the far land . "
8760	8799	8744	8744	he	35	" Father , tell me , I adjure thee by God and All - hallows , was it through yonder shard that the road lay , when thou must needs make thy first stride over a dead man ? "
8829	8836	8809	8809	he	208	" NO , IT WAS NOT . "
8970	8981	8963	8963	he	35	" My master , I was thinking of a thing . "
8982	8988	8990	8991	the carle	376	" Yea , of what ? "
8993	8997	8999	8999	Walter	35	" Of this , "
9001	9065	8999	8999	Walter	35	" that here in this land be strange adventures toward , and that if we , and I in especial , were to turn our backs on them , and go home with nothing done , it were pity of our lives : for all will be dull and deedless there . I was deeming it were good if we tried the adventure . "
9066	9070	9072	9074	the old man	208	" What adventure ? "
9090	9123	9088	9088	Walter	35	" The wending yonder pass to the eastward , whereby the huge men come to thee from out of the Bear - country ; that we might see what should come thereof . "
9140	9156	9134	9134	his	376	" That adventure were speedily proven : death would come of it , my son . "
9157	9163	9165	9165	Walter	35	" Yea , and how ? "
9171	9214	9167	9168	The carle	376	" The big men would take thee , and offer thee up as a blood - offering to that woman , who is their Mawmet . And if ye go all , then shall they do the like with all of you . "
9218	9223	9216	9216	Walter	35	" Is that sure ? "
9224	9228	9230	9231	the carle	376	" Dead sure , "
9233	9239	9241	9241	Walter	35	" How knowest thou this ? "
9243	9250	9252	9253	the carle	376	" I have been there myself , "
9255	9258	9260	9260	Walter	35	" Yea , "
9262	9269	9260	9260	Walter	35	" but thou camest away whole . "
9270	9276	9278	9279	the carle	376	" Art thou sure thereof ? "
9281	9290	9292	9292	Walter	35	" Thou art alive yet , old man , "
9294	9311	9292	9292	Walter	35	" for I have seen thee eat thy meat , which ghosts use not to do . "
9323	9407	9317	9319	the old man	208	" If I escaped , it was by this , that another woman saved me , and not often shall that befall . Nor wholly was I saved ; my body escaped forsooth . But where is my soul ? Where is my heart , and my life ? Young man , I rede thee , try no such adventure ; but go home to thy kindred if thou canst . Moreover , wouldst thou fare alone ? The others shall hinder thee . "
9411	9457	9409	9409	Walter	35	" I am the master ; they shall do as I bid them : besides , they will be well pleased to share my goods amongst them if I give them a writing to clear them of all charges which might be brought against them . "
9458	9465	9467	9468	the carle	376	" My son ! my son ! "
9470	9480	9467	9468	the carle	376	" I pray thee go not to thy death ! "
9605	9704	9597	9599	the old man	208	" I deem by the blowing that the hunt will be over and done , and that they be blowing on their fellows who have gone scatter - meal about the wood . It is now some five hours after noon , and thy men will be getting back with their venison , and will be fainest of the victuals they have caught ; therefore will I hasten on before , and get ready fire and water and other matters for the cooking . Wilt thou come with me , young master , or abide thy men here ? "
9709	9785	9705	9705	Walter	35	" I will rest and abide them here ; since I can not fail to see them hence as they go on their ways to thine house . And it may be well that I be at hand to command them and forbid , and put some order amongst them , for rough playmates they be , some of them , and now all heated with the hunting and the joy of the green earth . "
12268	12282	12262	12263	the creature	507	" How now ! What art thou ? Whence comest ? What wantest ? "
12289	12309	12283	12283	Walter	53	" I am a man ; I hight Golden Walter ; I come from Langton ; I want victual . "
12323	12370	12311	12312	the dwarf	182	" I know it all : I asked thee to see what wise thou wouldst lie . I was sent forth to look for thee ; and I have brought thee loathsome bread with me , such as ye aliens must needs eat : take it ! "
12405	12518	12399	12400	The dwarf	182	" Art thou dainty , alien ? Wouldst thou have flesh ? Well , give me thy bow and an arrow or two , since thou art lazy- sick , and I will get thee a coney or a hare , or a quail maybe . Ah , I forgot ; thou art dainty , and wilt not eat flesh as I do , blood and all together , but must needs half burn it in the fire , or mar it with hot water ; as they say my Lady does : or as the Wretch , the Thing does ; I know that , for I have seen It eating . "
12519	12522	12524	12524	Walter	35	" Nay , "
12526	12530	12524	12524	Walter	35	" this sufficeth ; "
12565	12584	12559	12559	he	35	" But what meanest thou by the Wretch and the Thing ? And what Lady is thy Lady ? "
12603	12660	12585	12586	The creature	507	" It hath a face white and red , like to thine ; and hands white as thine , yea , but whiter ; and the like it is underneath its raiment , only whiter still : for I have seen It - yes , I have seen It ; ah yes and yes and yes . "
12705	12824	12685	12685	he	35	" But thou , fool , wilt think It fair if thou fallest into Its hands , and wilt repent it thereafter , as I did . Oh , the mocking and gibes of It , and the tears and shrieks of It ; and the knife ! What ! sayest thou of my Lady ? - What Lady ? O alien , what other Lady is there ? And what shall I tell thee of her ? it is like that she made me , as she made the Bear men . But she made not the Wretch , the Thing ; and she hateth It sorely , as I do . And some day to come - "
12844	12867	12826	12826	he	512	" Now I have told thee overmuch , and O if my Lady come to hear thereof . Now I will go . "
13617	13635	13600	13601	the maiden	183	" Thou art an alien , art thou not ? For I have not seen thee before . "
13636	13639	13640	13640	he	35	" Yea , "
13643	13656	13640	13640	he	35	" I am an alien ; wilt thou be good to me ? "
13660	13711	13657	13657	She	526	" And why not ? I was afraid at first , for I thought it had been the King 's Son . I looked to see none other ; for of goodly men he has been the only one here in the land this long while , till thy coming . "
13715	13727	13712	13712	He	35	" Didst thou look for my coming at about this time ? "
13728	13732	13733	13733	she	526	" O nay , "
13736	13741	13733	13733	she	526	" how might I ? "
13745	13774	13743	13743	Walter	35	" I wot not ; but the other man seemed to be looking for me , and knew of me , and he brought me bread to eat . "
13790	13795	13775	13775	She	526	" What other one ? "
13830	13839	13817	13817	he	35	" The little man in the yellow raiment . "
13875	13900	13847	13847	she	526	" I pray thee talk not of that one while I am by , nor even think of him , if thou mayest forbear . "
13982	13993	13973	13973	he	35	" Have I hurt thee ? I pray thy pardon . "
14005	14017	13994	13994	She	526	" O nay ; thou wouldst not hurt me , thou ! "
14050	14066	14045	14045	Walter	35	" O me ! I have hurt thee again . Wherein have I done amiss ? "
14067	14074	14075	14075	she	526	" In nought , in nought , "
14078	14159	14075	14075	she	526	" but I am troubled , I wot not wherefore ; some thought hath taken hold of me , and I know it not . Mayhappen in a little while I shall know what troubles me . Now I bid thee depart from me a little , and I will abide here ; and when thou comest back , it will either be that I have found it out or not ; and in either case I will tell thee . "
14170	14178	14160	14160	She	526	" How long shall I abide away ? "
14188	14194	14184	14184	she	526	" For no long while . "
14347	14365	14344	14344	she	536	" I am glad thou art come back , though it be no long while since thy departure "
14378	14395	14344	14344	she	536	" Nevertheless I have been thinking many things , and thereof will I now tell thee . "
14399	14441	14396	14396	He	534	" Maiden , there is a river betwixt us , though it be no big one . Shall I not stride over , and come to thee , that we may sit down together side by side on the green grass ? "
14442	14445	14446	14446	she	536	" Nay , "
14449	14475	14446	14446	she	536	" not yet ; tarry a while till I have told thee of matters . I must now tell thee of my thoughts in order . "
14500	14565	14497	14497	she	536	" Now the first thing is this ; that though thou hast seen me first only within this hour , thou hast set thine heart upon me to have me for thy speech - friend and thy darling . And if this be not so , then is all my speech , yea and all my hope , come to an end at once . "
14566	14570	14572	14572	Walter	35	" O yea ! "
14574	14615	14572	14572	Walter	35	" even so it is : but how thou hast found this out I wot not ; since now for the first time I say it , that thou art indeed my love , and my dear and my darling . "
14616	14619	14620	14620	she	537	" Hush , "
14623	14773	14620	14620	she	537	" hush ! lest the wood have ears , and thy speech is loud : abide , and I shall tell thee how I know it . Whether this thy love shall outlast the first time that thou holdest my body in thine arms , I wot not , nor dost thou . But sore is my hope that it may be so ; for I also , though it be but scarce an hour since I set eyes on thee , have cast mine eyes on thee to have thee for my love and my darling , and my speech - friend . And this is how I wot that thou lovest me , my friend . Now is all this dear and joyful , and overflows my heart with sweetness . But now must I tell thee of the fear and the evil which lieth behind it . "
14787	14868	14775	14775	Walter	35	" Yea , yea ! But whatever evil entangle us , now we both know these two things , to wit , that thou lovest me , and I thee , wilt thou not come hither , that I may cast mine arms about thee , and kiss thee , if not thy kind lips or thy friendly face at all , yet at least thy dear hand : yea , that I may touch thy body in some wise ? "
14879	15017	14869	14869	She	538	" Nay , this above all things must not be ; and that it may not be is a part of the evil which entangles us . But hearken , friend , once again I tell thee that thy voice is over loud in this wilderness fruitful of evil . Now I have told thee , indeed , of two things whereof we both wot ; but next I must needs tell thee of things whereof I wot , and thou wottest not . Yet this were better , that thou pledge thy word not to touch so much as one of my hands , and that we go together a little way hence away from these tumbled stones , and sit down upon the open greensward ; whereas here is cover if there be spying abroad . "
15033	15052	15030	15030	Walter	35	" Since it must be so , I pledge thee my word to thee as I love thee . "
15135	15687	15126	15127	the maiden	183	" This is what I must needs say to thee now , that thou art come into a land perilous for any one that loveth aught of good ; from which , forsooth , I were fain that thou wert gotten away safely , even though I should die of longing for thee . As for myself , my peril is , in a measure , less than thine ; I mean the peril of death . But lo , thou , this iron on my foot is token that I am a thrall , and thou knowest in what wise thralls must pay for transgressions . Furthermore , of what I am , and how I came hither , time would fail me to tell ; but somewhile , maybe , I shall tell thee . I serve an evil mistress , of whom I may say that scarce I wot if she be a woman or not ; but by some creatures is she accounted for a god , and as a god is heried ; and surely never god was crueller nor colder than she . Me she hateth sorely ; yet if she hated me little or nought , small were the gain to me if it were her pleasure to deal hardly by me . But as things now are , and are like to be , it would not be for her pleasure , but for her pain and loss , to make an end of me , therefore , as I said e'en now , my mere life is not in peril with her ; unless , perchance , some sudden passion get the better of her , and she slay me , and repent of it thereafter . For so it is , that if it be the least evil of her conditions that she is wanton , at least wanton she is to the letter . Many a time hath she cast the net for the catching of some goodly young man ; and her latest prey save it be thou is the young man whom I named , when first I saw thee , by the name of the King 's Son . He is with us yet , and I fear him ; for of late hath he wearied of her , though it is but plain truth to say of her , that she is the wonder of all Beauties of the World . He hath wearied of her , I say , and hath cast his eyes upon me , and if I were heedless , he would betray me to the uttermost of the wrath of my mistress . For needs must I say of him , though he be a goodly man , and now fallen into thralldom , that he hath no bowels of compassion ; but is a dastard , who for an hour 's pleasure would undo me , and thereafter would stand by smiling and taking my mistress 's pardon with good cheer , while for me would be no pardon . Seest thou , therefore , how it is with me between these two cruel fools ? And moreover there are others of whom I will not even speak to thee . "
15704	15715	15690	15690	she	542	" Who shall deliver me from this death in life ? "
15721	15734	15717	15717	Walter	35	" For what else am I come hither , I , I ? "
15799	15879	15787	15788	the Maid	543	" Friend , whereas thou speakest of delivering me , it is more like that I shall deliver thee . And now I pray thy pardon for thus grieving thee with my grief , and that more especially because thou mayst not solace thy grief with kisses and caresses ; but so it was , that for once I was smitten by the thought of the anguish of this land , and the joy of all the world besides . "
15898	15991	15881	15881	she	542	" Now dear friend and darling , take good heed to all that I shall say to thee , whereas thou must do after the teaching of my words . And first , I deem by the monster having met thee at the gates of the land , and refreshed thee , that the Mistress hath looked for thy coming ; nay , by thy coming hither at all , that she hath cast her net and caught thee . Hast thou noted aught that might seem to make this more like ? "
15995	16026	15993	15993	Walter	35	" Three times in full daylight have I seen go past me the images of the monster and thee and a glorious lady , even as if ye were alive . "
16053	16193	16050	16050	She	544	" Then it is no longer perhaps , but certain , that thou art her latest catch ; and even so I deemed from the first : and , dear friend , this is why I have not suffered thee to kiss or caress me , so sore as I longed for thee . For the Mistress will have thee for her only , and hath lured thee hither for nought else ; and she is wise in wizardry even as some deal am I , and wert thou to touch me with hand or mouth on my naked flesh , yea , or were it even my raiment , then would she scent the savour of thy love upon me , and then , though it may be she would spare thee , she would not spare me . "
16235	16378	16227	16228	the Maid	543	" Nevertheless we will not die redeless . Now thou must look to this , that from henceforward it is thee , and not the King 's Son , whom she desireth , and that so much the more that she hath not set eyes on thee . Remember this , whatsoever her seeming may be to thee . Now , therefore , shall the King 's Son be free , though he know it not , to cast his love on whomso he will ; and , in a way , I also shall be free to yeasay him . Though , forsooth , so fulfilled is she with malice and spite , that even then she may turn round on me to punish me for doing that which she would have me do . Now let me think of it . "
16392	16626	16381	16381	she	548	" Yea , all things are perilous , and a perilous rede I have thought of , whereof I will not tell thee as yet ; so waste not the short while by asking me . At least the worst will be no worse than what shall come if we strive not against it . And now , my friend , amongst perils it is growing more and more perilous that we twain should be longer together . But I would say one thing yet ; and maybe another thereafter . Thou hast cast thy love upon one who will be true to thee , whatsoever may befall ; yet is she a guileful creature , and might not help it her life long , and now for thy very sake must needs be more guileful now than ever before . And as for me , the guileful , my love have I cast upon a lovely man , and one true and simple , and a stout- heart ; but at such a pinch is he , that if he withstand all temptation , his withstanding may belike undo both him and me . Therefore swear we both of us , that by both of us shall all guile and all falling away be forgiven on the day when we shall be free to love each the other as our hearts will . "
16631	16668	16627	16627	Walter	35	" O love , I swear it indeed ! thou art my Hallow , and I will swear it as on the relics of a Hallow ; on thy hands and thy feet I swear it . "
16703	16711	16700	16700	she	549	" On thy life I swear it ! "
16716	16980	16713	16713	she	549	" Now is there nought for thee to do but to go hence straight to the Golden House , which is my Mistress 's house , and the only house in this land save one which I may not see , and lieth southward no long way . How she will deal with thee , I wot not ; but all I have said of her and thee and the King 's Son is true . Therefore I say to thee , be wary and cold at heart , whatsoever outward semblance thou mayst make . If thou have to yield thee to her , then yield rather late than early , so as to gain time . Yet not so late as to seem shamed in yielding for fear 's sake . Hold fast to thy life , my friend , for in warding that , thou wardest me from grief without remedy . Thou wilt see me ere long ; it may be to - morrow , it may be some days hence . But forget not , that what I may do , that I am doing . Take heed also that thou pay no more heed to me , or rather less , than if thou wert meeting a maiden of no account in the streets of thine own town . O my love ! barren is this first farewell , as was our first meeting ; but surely shall there be another meeting better than the first , and the last farewell may be long and long yet . "
17612	17625	17604	17605	the man	1710	" Seest thou not that there is a man in the hall ? "
17626	17629	17630	17630	she	576	" Yea , "
17633	17655	17630	17630	she	576	" I see him yonder , kneeling on his knees ; let him come nigher and give some account of himself . "
17744	17755	17740	17741	the man	1710	" Why doest thou not kneel as thou didst erewhile ? "
17776	17813	17770	17771	the Lady	576	" Nay , friend , it matters not whether he kneel or stand ; but he may say , if he will , what he would have of me , and wherefore he is come hither . "
17827	17884	17816	17816	Walter	35	" Lady , I have strayed into this land , and have come to thine house as I suppose , and if I be not welcome , I may well depart straightway , and seek a way out of thy land , if thou wouldst drive me thence , as well as out of thine house . "
17934	17937	17938	17938	she	576	" Newcomer , "
17941	18163	17938	17938	she	576	" I have not bidden thee hither ; but here mayst thou abide a while if thou wilt ; nevertheless , take heed that here is no King 's Court . There is , forsooth , a folk that serveth me or , it may be , more than one , of whom thou wert best to know nought . Of others I have but two servants , whom thou wilt see ; and the one is a strange creature , who should scare thee or scathe thee with a good will , but of a good will shall serve nought save me ; the other is a woman , a thrall , of little avail , save that , being compelled , she will work woman 's service for me , but whom none else shall compel . . . Yea , but what is all this to thee ; or to me that I should tell it to thee ? I will not drive thee away ; but if thine entertainment please thee not , make no plaint thereof to me , but depart at thy will . Now is this talk betwixt us overlong , since , as thou seest , I and this King 's Son are in converse together . Art thou a King 's Son ? "
18164	18169	18171	18171	Walter	35	" Nay , Lady , "
18173	18184	18171	18171	Walter	35	" I am but of the sons of the merchants . "
18185	18190	18191	18191	she	584	" It matters not , "
18194	18204	18191	18191	she	584	" go thy ways into one of the chambers . "
19350	19396	19335	19338	the King 's Son	1781	" Thou art to enter the house , and go into thy chamber forthwith , and by no means to go forth of it betwixt sunset and sunrise . My Lady will not away with thy prowling round the house in the night - tide . "
19741	19800	19738	19738	she	576	" Otto , belike it were well to have a little patience , till we find out what the man is , and whence he cometh ; it will always be easy to rid us of him ; it is but a word to our Dwarf - king , and it will be done in a few minutes . "
19801	19804	19806	19807	the King	1780	" Patience ! "
19813	19921	19806	19807	the King	1780	" I wot not how to have patience with him ; for I can see of him that he is rude and violent and headstrong , and a low - born wily one . Forsooth , he had patience enough with me the other even , when I rated him in , like the dog that he is , and he had no manhood to say one word to me . Soothly , as he followed after me , I had a mind to turn about and deal him a buffet on the face , to see if I could but draw one angry word from him . "
19929	20014	19922	19923	The Lady	576	" Well , Otto , I know not ; that which thou deemest dastardy in him may be but prudence and wisdom , and he an alien , far from his friends and nigh to his foes . Perchance we shall yet try him what he is . Meanwhile , I rede thee try him not with buffets , save he be weaponless and with bounden hands ; or else I deem that but a little while shalt thou be fain of thy blow . "
20066	20129	20056	20059	the King 's Son	1781	" I know not what is in thine heart concerning this runagate , that thou shouldst bemock me with his valiancy , whereof thou knowest nought . If thou deem me unworthy of thee , send me back safe to my father 's country ; I may look to have worship there ; yea , and the love of fair women belike . "
20152	20209	20149	20149	she	576	" Nay , lay not thine hand on my shoulder , for to - day and now it is not the hand of love , but of pride and folly , and would - be mastery . Nay , neither shalt thou rise up and leave me until thy mood is softer and kinder to me . "
20231	20281	20221	20224	the King 's Son	1781	" My goddess , I pray thee pardon me ! But canst thou wonder that I fear thy wearying of me , and am therefore peevish and jealous ? thou so far above the Queens of the World , and I a poor youth that without thee were nothing ! "
20292	20323	20287	20287	he	1781	" Was it not so , O goddess , that this man of the sons of the merchants was little heedful of thee , and thy loveliness and thy majesty ? "
20329	20387	20324	20324	She	669	" Maybe he deemed not that he had much to gain of us , seeing thee sitting by our side , and whereas we spake to him coldly and sternly and disdainfully . Withal , the poor youth was dazzled and shamefaced before us ; that we could see in the eyes and the mien of him . "
20444	20501	20426	20426	she	669	" Lady , didst thou not see somewhat else in his eyes , to wit , that they had but of late looked on some fair woman other than thee ? As for me , I deem it not so unlike that on the way to thine hall he may have fallen in with thy Maid . "
20554	20639	20551	20551	She	576	" Yea , that is not ill thought of ; but we may not always keep our thrall in mind . If it be so as thou deemest , we shall come to know it most like when we next fall in with her ; or if she hath been shy this time , then shall she pay the heavier for it ; for we will question her by the Fountain in the Hall as to what betid by the Fountain of the Rock . "
20650	20690	20551	20551	She	576	" Lady , were it not better to question the man himself ? the Maid is stout - hearted , and will not be speedily quelled into a true tale ; whereas the man I deem of no account . "
20691	20696	20698	20699	the Lady	576	" No , no , "
20702	20708	20698	20699	the Lady	576	" it shall not be . "
20721	20733	20718	20718	she	576	" How if the man should prove to be our master ? "
20734	20740	20742	20743	the King	1780	" Nay , our Lady , "
20747	20779	20742	20743	the King	1780	" thou art jesting with me ; thou and thy might and thy wisdom , and all that thy wisdom may command , to be over- mastered by a gangrel churl ! "
20780	20795	20797	20798	the Lady	576	" But how if I will not have it command , King 's Son ? "
20800	20916	20797	20798	the Lady	576	" I tell thee I know thine heart , but thou knowest not mine . But be at peace ! For since thou hast prayed for this woman - nay , not with thy words , I wot , but with thy trembling hands , and thine anxious eyes , and knitted brow - I say , since thou hast prayed for her so earnestly , she shall escape this time . But whether it will be to her gain in the long run , I misdoubt me . See thou to that , Otto ! thou who hast held me in thine arms so oft . And now thou mayest depart if thou wilt . "
21156	21162	21134	21134	she	689	" Come hither , guest . "
21175	21310	21172	21172	she	689	" Though as yet thou hast had no welcome here , and no honour , it hath not entered into thine heart to flee from us ; and to say sooth , that is well for thee , for flee away from our hand thou mightest not , nor mightest thou depart without our furtherance . But for this we can thee thank , that thou hast abided here our bidding and eaten thine heart through the heavy wearing of four days , and made no plaint . Yet I can not deem thee a dastard ; thou so well knit and shapely of body , so clear - eyed and bold of visage . Wherefore now I ask thee , art thou willing to do me service , thereby to earn thy guesting ? "
21366	21416	21364	21364	he	35	" Lady , I can thank thee humbly and heartily in that thou biddest me do thee service ; for these days past I have loathed the emptiness of the hours , and nought better could I ask for than to serve so glorious a Mistress in all honour . "
21424	21544	21417	21417	She	690	" Thou shalt not call me Mistress ; there is but one who so calleth me , that is my thrall ; and thou art none such . Thou shalt call me Lady , and I shall be well pleased that thou be my squire , and for this present thou shalt serve me in the hunting . So get thy gear ; take thy bow and arrows , and gird thee to thy sword . For in this fair land may one find beasts more perilous than be buck or hart . I go now to array me ; we will depart while the day is yet young ; for so make we the summer day the fairest . "
21758	21884	21749	21749	she	543	" Look thou , my Maid , at this fair new Squire that I have gotten ! Will not he be valiant in the greenwood ? And see whether he be well shapen or not . Doth he not touch thine heart , when thou thinkest of all the woe , and fear , and trouble of the World beyond the Wood , which he hath escaped , to dwell in this little land peaceably , and well - beloved both by the Mistress and the Maid ? And thou , my Squire , look a little at this fair slim Maiden , and say if she pleaseth thee not : didst thou deem that we had any thing so fair in this lonely place ? "
21989	22027	21980	21981	the Lady	576	" Come hither , child , and fear not this frank and free young man , who belike feareth thee a little , and full certainly feareth me ; and yet only after the manner of men . "
22089	22143	22085	22085	Walter	35	" Lo thou , Squire ! is not this a lovely thing to have grown up amongst our rough oak- boles ? What ! art thou looking at the iron ring there ? It is nought , save a token that she is mine , and that I may not be without her . "
22163	22202	22145	22145	she	543	" Go thou now , and bring hither the good grey ones ; for needs must we bring home some venison to - day , whereas this stout warrior may not feed on nought save manchets and honey . "
22319	22440	22302	22303	the Lady	576	" Ah , our Squire , is it so that now thou hast seen my Maid thou wouldst with a good will abide behind to talk with her ? But call to mind thy word pledged to me e'en now ! And moreover I tell thee this for thy behoof now she is out of ear - shot , that I will above all things take thee away to - day : for there be other eyes , and they nought uncomely , that look at whiles on my fair - ankled thrall ; and who knows but the swords might be out if I take not the better heed , and give thee not every whit of thy will . "
22541	22565	22535	22535	she	722	" So , so , Sir Squire , now art thou awake again , and mayest for a little while look on me . "
22623	22680	22603	22603	he	723	" Nay , most gracious of ladies , never would I abide behind to - day since thou farest afield . But if my speech be hampered , or mine eyes stray , is it not because my mind is confused by thy beauty , and the honey of kind words which floweth from thy mouth ? "
22695	22736	22681	22681	She	722	" This is well spoken , Squire , and even what a squire should say to his liege lady , when the sun is up on a fair morning , and she and he and all the world are glad . "
22868	22937	22865	22865	She	722	" Thou art verily a fair squire before the hunt is up , and if thou be as good in the hunting , all will be better than well , and the guest will be welcome . But lo ! here cometh our Maid with the good grey ones . Go meet her , and we will tarry no longer than for thy taking the leash in hand . "
23059	23239	23050	23051	the Lady	576	" Look to thyself , our Maid , while we are away . This fair young man thou needest not to fear indeed , for he is good and leal ; but what thou shalt do with the King 's Son I wot not . He is a hot lover forsooth , but a hard man ; and whiles evil is his mood , and perilous both to thee and me . And if thou do his will , it shall be ill for thee ; and if thou do it not , take heed of him , and let me , and me only , come between his wrath and thee . I may do somewhat for thee . Even yesterday he was instant with me to have thee chastised after the manner of thralls ; but I bade him keep silence of such words , and jeered him and mocked him , till he went away from me peevish and in anger . So look to it that thou fall not into any trap of his contrivance . "
23283	23314	23266	23266	her	576	" Now , Squire , let us leave all these troubles and wiles and desires behind us , and flit through the merry greenwood like the Gentiles of old days . "
23707	23721	23689	23689	she	576	" Squire , why dost thou stand staring at me like a fool ? "
23722	23727	23728	23728	he	35	" Yea , Lady , "
23731	23750	23728	23728	he	35	" but the sight of thee maketh me foolish to do aught else but to look on thee . "
23759	23798	23751	23751	She	576	" Tush , Squire , the day is too far spent for soft and courtly speeches ; what was good there is nought so good here . Withal , I know more of thine heart than thou deemest . "
23828	23937	23819	23819	she	576	" Look ye , Squire , I am hot and weary , and ill - content ; but presently it will be better with me ; for my knees have been telling my shoulders that the cold water of this little lake will be sweet and pleasant this summer noonday , and that I shall forget my foil when I have taken my pleasure therein . Wherefore , go thou with thine hounds without the thicket and there abide my coming . And I bid thee look not aback as thou goest , for therein were peril to thee : I shall not keep thee tarrying long alone . "
24136	24170	24123	24123	she	749	" Squire , hast thou no meat in thy wallet ? For , meseemeth , I fed thee when thou wert hungry the other day ; do thou now the same by me . "
24217	24242	24214	24214	she	749	" Nay , my Squire , sit down by me and eat with me , for to - day are we both hunters together . "
24318	24367	24315	24315	she	749	" Thou hast told me much and answered all my questions wisely , and as my good Squire should , and that pleaseth me . But now tell me of the city wherein thou wert born and bred ; a city whereof thou hast hitherto told me nought . "
24368	24371	24372	24372	he	35	" Lady , "
24375	24406	24315	24315	she	749	" it is a fair and a great city , and to many it seemeth lovely . But I have left it , and now it is nothing to me . "
24407	24414	24416	24416	she	758	" Hast thou not kindred there ? "
24418	24421	24423	24423	he	35	" Yea , "
24425	24439	24423	24423	he	35	" and foemen withal ; and a false woman waylayeth my life there . "
24440	24446	24448	24449	the Lady	576	" And what was she ? "
24454	24461	24452	24452	Walter	35	" She was but my wife . "
24462	24467	24469	24470	the Lady	576	" Was she fair ? "
24483	24562	24472	24472	Walter	35	" I was going to say that she was wellnigh as fair as thou ; but that may scarce be . Yet was she very fair . But now , kind and gracious Lady , I will say this word to thee : I marvel that thou askest so many things concerning the city of Langton on Holm , where I was born , and where are my kindred yet ; for meseemeth that thou knowest it thyself . "
24563	24570	24572	24573	the Lady	576	" I know it , I ? "
24575	24585	24587	24587	Walter	35	" What , then ! thou knowest it not ? "
24604	24651	24596	24596	her	576	" Dost thou deem that I wander about the world and its cheaping - steads like one of the chap - men ? Nay , I dwell in the Wood beyond the World , and nowhere else . What hath put this word into thy mouth ? "
24655	24729	24652	24652	He	35	" Pardon me , Lady , if I have misdone ; but thus it was : Mine own eyes beheld thee going down the quays of our city , and thence a ship - board , and the ship sailed out of the haven . And first of all went a strange dwarf , whom I have seen here , and then thy Maid ; and then went thy gracious and lovely body . "
24760	24838	24753	24753	she	576	" Squire , I see of thee that thou art no liar , nor light of wit , therefore I suppose that thou hast verily seen some appearance of me ; but never have I been in Langton , nor thought thereof , nor known that such a stead there was until thou namedst it e'en now . Wherefore , I deem that an enemy hath cast the shadow of me on the air of that land . "
24839	24845	24847	24847	Walter	35	" Yea , my Lady , "
24849	24861	24847	24847	Walter	35	" and what enemy mightest thou have to have done this ? "
24879	24921	24862	24862	She	764	" Knowest thou not the saw , that a man 's foes are they of his own house ? If I find out for a truth who hath done this , the said enemy shall have an evil hour with me . "
25007	25056	25004	25004	she	764	" But in sooth , however it may be , I thank thee , my Squire and friend , for telling me hereof . And surely no wyte do I lay on thee . And , moreover , is it not this vision which hath brought thee hither ? "
25057	25064	25066	25066	he	35	" So it is , Lady , "
25068	25076	25078	25079	the Lady	576	" Then have we to thank it , "
25081	25090	25078	25079	the Lady	576	" and thou art welcome to our land . "
25181	25243	25168	25168	she	764	" Now is the day wearing , and if we are to bear back any venison we must buckle to the work . So arise , Squire , and take the hounds and come with me ; for not far off is a little thicket which mostly harbours foison of deer , great and small . Let us come our ways . "
25349	25438	25342	25342	she	764	" Squire , I am no ill woodman , so that thou mayst trust me that we shall not be brought to shame the second time ; and I shall do sagely ; so nock an arrow to thy bow , and abide me here , and stir not hence ; for I shall enter this thicket without the hounds , and arouse the quarry for thee ; and see that thou be brisk and clean - shooting , and then shalt thou have a reward of me . "
25964	25978	25946	25946	she	576	" What hath befallen , Squire , that I have slept and dreamed ? "
26003	26016	25993	25993	she	576	" Let us leave this wood , for the Enemy is therein . "
26086	26092	26071	26071	she	576	" Squire , come hither . "
26101	26119	26098	26098	she	576	" I am weary again ; let us sit under this quicken- tree , and rest us . "
26141	26152	26138	26138	she	576	" Why didst thou not bring the lion 's hide ? "
26156	26174	26153	26153	He	35	" Lady , I will go back and flay the beast , and bring on the hide . "
26195	26211	26181	26181	she	576	" Nay , thou shalt not go ; abide with me . Sit down again . "
26220	26245	26217	26217	she	576	" Thou shalt not go from me ; for I am afraid : I am not used to looking on the face of death . "
26280	26299	26271	26271	she	576	" How was it with the aspect of me when I stood before the peril of the Enemy ? "
26308	26313	26315	26315	he	35	" O gracious one , "
26317	26333	26315	26315	he	35	" thou wert , as ever , full lovely , but I feared for thee . "
26346	26402	26343	26343	she	576	" Good and true Squire , I said ere I entered the thicket e'en now that I would reward thee if thou slewest the quarry . He is dead , though thou hast left the skin behind upon the carcase . Ask now thy reward , but take time to think what it shall be . "
26529	26561	26523	26523	she	576	" The good Squire is shamefaced ; he feareth a lady more than a lion . Will it be a reward to thee if I bid thee to kiss my cheek ? "
26601	26622	26596	26596	she	576	" Come , Squire , and let us home ; be not abashed , there shall be other rewards hereafter . "
26661	26678	26655	26656	the Lady	576	" I go to my chamber , and now is thy service over for this day . "
26950	27069	26947	26947	she	804	" King 's Son , thou hast threatened me oft and unkindly , and now thou threatenest me again , and no less unkindly . But whatever were thy need herein before , now is there no more need ; for my Mistress , of whom thou wert weary , is now grown weary of thee , and belike will not now reward me for drawing thy love to me , as once she would have done ; to wit , before the coming of this stranger . Therefore I say , since I am but a thrall , poor and helpless , betwixt you two mighty ones , I have no choice but to do thy will . "
27295	27325	27286	27289	the King 's Son	1781	" Sweetling , I shall take the gift thou givest me , neither shall I threaten thee any more , howbeit thou givest it not very gladly or graciously . "
27343	27347	27348	27348	she	543	" My lord , "
27351	27360	27348	27348	she	543	" is not this the manner of women ? "
27361	27364	27365	27365	he	35	" Well , "
27368	27418	27365	27365	he	35	" I say that I will take thy love even so given . Yet let me hear again that thou lovest not that vile newcomer , and that thou hast not seen him , save this morning along with my Lady . Nay now , thou shalt swear it . "
27419	27426	27427	27427	she	543	" What shall I swear by ? "
27433	27441	27444	27444	he	35	" Thou shalt swear by my body ; "
27470	27478	27453	27453	she	543	" I swear it by thy body . "
27509	27527	27479	27479	He	35	" Now have I had hansel : but tell me , when shall I come to thee ? "
27533	27561	27528	27528	She	543	" Within three days at furthest ; I will do thee to wit of the day and the hour to - morrow , or the day after . "
27571	27582	27562	27562	He	35	" Forget it not , or the threat holds good . "
27672	27680	27666	27666	She	543	" Friend , touch me not yet ! "
27694	27701	27691	27691	She	543	" Thou art angry with me ? "
27711	27848	27850	27850	she	825	" Friend , this at least I will pray thee ; not to play with life and death ; with happiness and misery . Dost thou not remember the oath which we swore each to each but a little while ago ? And dost thou deem that I have changed in these few days ? Is thy mind concerning thee and me the same as it was ? If it be not so , now tell me . For now have I the mind to do as if neither thou nor I are changed to each other , whoever may have kissed mine unwilling lips , or whomsoever thy lips may have kissed . But if thou hast changed , and wilt no longer give me thy love , nor crave mine , then shall this steel "
27858	27970	27850	27850	she	825	" be for the fool and the dastard who hath made thee wroth with me , my friend , and my friend that I deemed I had won . And then let come what will come ! But if thou be nought changed , and the oath yet holds , then , when a little while hath passed , may we thrust all evil and guile and grief behind us , and long joy shall lie before us , and long life , and all honour in death : if only thou wilt do as I bid thee , O my dear , and my friend , and my first friend ! "
28030	28532	28025	28025	she	827	" Now indeed I see that it is well with me , yea , and with thee also . A sore pain it is to me , that not even now may I take thine hand , and cast mine arms about thee , and kiss the lips that love me . But so it has to be . My dear , even so I were fain to stand here long before thee , even if we spake no more word to each other ; but abiding here is perilous ; for there is ever an evil spy upon my doings , who has now as I deem followed the King 's Son to the house , but who will return when he has tracked him home thither : so we must sunder . But belike there is yet time for a word or two : first , the rede which I had thought on for our deliverance is now afoot , though I durst not tell thee thereof , nor have time thereto . But this much shall I tell thee , that whereas great is the craft of my Mistress in wizardry , yet I also have some little craft therein , and this , which she hath not , to change the aspect of folk so utterly that they seem other than they verily are ; yea , so that one may have the aspect of another . Now the next thing is this : whatsoever my Mistress may bid thee , do her will therein with no more nay - saying than thou deemest may please her . And the next thing : wheresoever thou mayst meet me , speak not to me , make no sign to me , even when I seem to be all alone , till I stoop down and touch the ring on my ankle with my right hand ; but if I do so , then stay thee , without fail , till I speak . The last thing I will say to thee , dear friend , ere we both go our ways , this it is . When we are free , and thou knowest all that I have done , I pray thee deem me not evil and wicked , and be not wroth with me for my deed ; whereas thou wottest well that I am not in like plight with other women . I have heard tell that when the knight goeth to the war , and hath overcome his foes by the shearing of swords and guileful tricks , and hath come back home to his own folk , they praise him and bless him , and crown him with flowers , and boast of him before God in the minster for his deliverance of friend and folk and city . Why shouldst thou be worse to me than this ? Now is all said , my dear and my friend ; farewell , farewell ! "
29001	29017	28987	28987	she	526	" I give thee good day , good Squire , and well art thou met . "
29078	29096	29062	29062	her	526	" What is this , my Squire , that thou kneelest to me as to an idol ? "
29101	29118	29097	29097	He	35	" I wot not ; but perchance thou art an idol ; and I fear thee . "
29119	29122	29123	29123	she	526	" What ! "
29126	29137	29123	29123	she	526	" more than yesterday , whenas thou sawest me afraid ? "
29141	29167	29139	29139	he	35	" Yea , for that now I see thee unhidden , and meseemeth there hath been none such since the old days of the Gentiles . "
29171	29203	29168	29168	She	526	" Hast thou not yet bethought thee of a gift to crave of me , a reward for the slaying of mine enemy , and the saving of me from death ? "
29204	29209	29210	29210	he	35	" O my Lady , "
29213	29253	29210	29210	he	35	" even so much would I have done for any other lady , or , forsooth , for any poor man ; for so my manhood would have bidden me . Speak not of gifts to me then . Moreover "
29264	29281	29260	29260	his	35	" didst thou not give me my sweet reward yesterday ? What more durst I ask ? "
29329	29459	29309	29309	she	844	" Nay , what is this ? It is growing in my mind that thou deemest the gift of me unworthy ! Thou , an alien , an outcast ; one endowed with the little wisdom of the World without the Wood ! And here I stand before thee , all glorious in my nakedness , and so fulfilled of wisdom , that I can make this wilderness to any whom I love more full of joy than the kingdoms and cities of the world - and thou ! - Ah , but it is the Enemy that hath done this , and made the guileless guileful ! Yet will I have the upper hand at least , though thou suffer for it , and I suffer for thee . "
29512	29609	29502	29502	he	35	" Nay , Lady , I know what thy words mean , whereas I remember thy first welcome of me . I wot , forsooth , that thou wouldst call me base - born , and of no account , and unworthy to touch the hem of thy raiment ; and that I have been over - bold , and guilty towards thee ; and doubtless this is sooth , and I have deserved thine anger : but I will not ask thee to pardon me , for I have done but what I must needs . "
29656	29757	29646	29646	she	845	" This is but foolish talk ; for yesterday did I see thy valiancy , and to- day I have seen thy goodliness ; and I say , that though thou mightest not be good enough for a fool woman of the earthly baronage , yet art thou good enough for me , the wise and the mighty , and the lovely . And whereas thou sayest that I gave thee but disdain when first thou camest to us , grudge not against me therefor , because it was done but to prove thee ; and now thou art proven . "
29803	29823	29796	29796	she	849	" Hereby is all forgiven , both thine offence and mine ; and now cometh joy and merry days . "
29853	29949	29846	29846	she	849	" Thou mightest deem my chamber in the Golden House of the Wood over - queenly , since thou art no masterful man . So now hast thou chosen well the place wherein to meet me to - day , for hard by on the other side of the stream is a bower of pleasance , which , forsooth , not every one who cometh to this land may find ; there shall I be to thee as one of the up- country damsels of thine own land , and thou shalt not be abashed . "
30602	30645	30596	30596	her	873	" Ah , friend , belike this shall be the last time that I shall say to thee , touch me not , nay , not so much as my hand , or if it were but the hem of my raiment . "
30664	30673	30655	30655	he	35	" Why , what hath befallen of late ? "
30674	30678	30679	30679	she	873	" O friend , "
30682	30687	30679	30679	she	873	" this hath befallen . "
30802	30881	30791	30791	her	543	" This hath befallen , friend , that there is no longer any need to refrain thy love nor mine ; therefore I say to thee , come to my chamber and it is the red chamber over against thine , though thou knewest it not an hour before this next midnight , and then thy sorrow and mine shall be at an end : and now I must needs depart . Follow me not , but remember ! "
31259	31262	31263	31263	she	889	" Squire , "
31266	31353	31263	31263	she	889	" we have deemed it meet to have the hide of the servant of the Enemy , the lion to wit , whom thou slewest yesterday , for a carpet to our feet ; wherefore go now , take thy wood - knife , and flay the beast , and bring me home his skin . This shall be all thy service for this day , so mayst thou do it at thine own leisure , and not weary thyself . May good go with thee . "
31967	32084	31947	31947	she	909	" Hearken ! but speak not till I have done : I bade thee to - night 's meeting because I saw that there was one anigh whom I must needs beguile . But by thine oath , and thy love , and all that thou art , I adjure thee come not unto me this night as I bade thee ! but be hidden in the hazel - copse outside the house , as it draws toward midnight , and abide me there . Dost thou hearken , and wilt thou ? Say yes or no in haste , for I may not tarry a moment of time . Who knoweth what is behind me ? "
32085	32088	32090	32090	Walter	35	" Yes , "
32093	32099	32090	32090	Walter	35	" but friend and love - "
32100	32104	32105	32105	she	911	" No more , "
32108	32113	32105	32105	she	911	" hope the best ; "
32351	32414	32337	32340	the King 's Son	1781	" I give thee good even , my Lady 's Squire ! I owe thee something of courtesy , whereas it is by thy means that I shall be made happy , both to - night , and to - morrow , and many to - morrows ; and sooth it is , that but little courtesy have I done thee hitherto . "
32472	32495	32465	32465	he	35	" I can thee thank , King 's Son ; and good it is that someone is happy in this strange land . "
32496	32508	32510	32511	the other	922	" Art thou not happy then , Squire of my Lady ? "
32557	32576	32540	32540	he	35	" O yea , yea , why should I not be so ? How might I be otherwise ? "
32577	32581	32583	32586	the King 's Son	1781	" Yea then , "
32588	32608	32610	32610	he	1781	" why didst thou say that thou wert glad someone is happy ? Who is unhappy , deemest thou ? "
32620	32658	32616	32616	Walter	35	" Said I so ? I suppose then that I was thinking of thee ; for when first I saw thee , yea , and afterwards , thou didst seem heavy - hearted and ill - content . "
32675	32797	32672	32672	he	35	" Yea , so it was ; for look you , both ways it was : I was unfree , and I had sown the true desire of my heart whereas it waxed not . But now I am on the brink and verge of freedom , and presently shall my desire be blossomed . Nay now , Squire , I deem thee a good fellow , though it may be somewhat of a fool ; so I will no more speak riddles to thee . Thus it is : the Maid hath promised me all mine asking , and is mine ; and in two or three days , by her helping also , I shall see the world again . "
32806	32819	32798	32799	Quoth Walter	35	" And the Lady ? what shall she say to this matter ? "
32834	33030	32820	32823	The King 's Son	1781	" Sir Squire , thou knowest enough not to need to ask this . Why should I tell thee that she accounteth more of thy little finger than of my whole body ? Now I tell thee hereof freely ; first , because this my fruition of love , and my freeing from thralldom , is , in a way , of thy doing . For thou art become my supplanter , and hast taken thy place with yonder lovely tyrant . Fear not for me ! she will let me go . As for thyself , see thou to it ! But again I tell thee hereof because my heart is light and full of joy , and telling thee will pleasure me , and can not do me any harm . For if thou say : How if I carry the tale to my Lady ? I answer , thou wilt not . For I know that thine heart hath been somewhat set on the jewel that my hand holdeth ; and thou knowest well on whose head the Lady 's wrath would fall , and that would be neither thine nor mine . "
33031	33036	33038	33038	Walter	35	" Thou sayest sooth , "
33040	33048	33038	33038	Walter	35	" neither is treason my wo nt . "
33062	33080	33059	33059	Walter	35	" But how if the Maiden had nay - said thee ; what hadst thou done then ? "
33081	33086	33088	33089	the King	1780	" By the heavens ! "
33109	33123	33107	33107	I	0	" But he broke off , and said quietly , yet somewhat doggedly : "
33143	33143	33132	33132	She	933	"
33164	33178	33161	33161	he	35	" When thou art free wilt thou go to thine own land again ? "
33179	33182	33184	33187	the King 's Son	1781	" Yea , "
33196	33196	33190	33190	she	933	"
33197	33216	33218	33218	Walter	35	" And wilt thou make her thy lady and queen when thou comest to thy father 's land ? "
33231	33270	33225	33225	his	1781	" When I am in mine own land I may do with her what I will ; but I look for it that I shall do no otherwise with her than that she shall be well - content . "
33418	33433	33403	33403	she	576	" What hast thou done , Squire ? Why art thou come before me ? "
33445	33462	33434	33434	He	35	" O gracious Lady , thou badest me service , and I have been about it . "
33466	33478	33463	33463	She	576	" Tell me then , tell me , what hath betided ? "
33479	33482	33484	33484	he	35	" Lady , "
33486	33514	33484	33484	he	35	" when I entered the thicket of thy swooning I found there no carcase of the lion , nor any sign of the dragging away of him . "
33553	33579	33597	33597	she	576	" Did I not tell thee that some enemy had done that unto me ? and lo ! now thou seest that so it is . "
33603	33656	33597	33597	she	576	" But I will overcome her , and make her days evil , but keep death away from her , that she may die many times over ; and know all the sickness of the heart , when foes be nigh , and friends afar , and there is none to deliver ! "
33694	33840	33686	33686	she	576	" But thou ! this hath little to do with thee ; and now to thee I speak : Now cometh even and night . Go thou to thy chamber , and there shalt thou find raiment worthy of thee , what thou now art , and what thou shalt be ; do on the same , and make thyself most goodly , and then come thou hither and eat and drink with me , and afterwards depart whither thou wilt , till the night has worn to its midmost ; and then come thou to my chamber , to wit , through the ivory door in the gallery above ; and then and there shall I tell thee a thing , and it shall be for the weal both of thee and of me , but for the grief and woe of the Enemy . "
34283	34327	34278	34279	the Lady	576	" Now must I leave thee for a little , and thou wottest where and how we shall meet next ; and meanwhile disport thee as thou wilt , so that thou weary not thyself , for I love to see thee joyous . "
34475	34534	34449	34452	the King 's Son	1781	" Now may it be seen how thou art risen in degree above me , whereas I am but a king 's son , and that a king of a far country ; whereas thou art a king of kings , or shalt be this night , yea , and of this very country wherein we both are . "
34556	34624	34547	34547	he	35	" Fair sir , art thou as well contented with thy lot as when the sun went down ? Hast thou no doubt or fear ? Will the Maid verily keep tryst with thee , or hath she given thee yea - say but to escape thee this time ? Or , again , may she not turn to the Lady and appeal to her against thee ? "
34681	34843	34660	34663	the King 's Son	1781	" Yea , yea ! this word of thine showeth how little thou wottest of that which lieth betwixt my darling and thine . Doth the lamb appeal from the shepherd to the wolf ? Even so shall the Maid appeal from me to thy Lady . What ! ask thy Lady at thy leisure what her wo nt hath been with her thrall ; she shall think it a fair tale to tell thee thereof . But thereof is my Maid all whole now by reason of her wisdom in leechcraft , or somewhat more . And now I tell thee again , that the beforesaid Maid must needs do my will ; for if I be the deep sea , and I deem not so ill of myself , that other one is the devil ; as belike thou shalt find out for thyself later on . Yea , all is well with me , and more than well . "
35099	35132	35089	35089	she	543	" Now , now ! there may yet be time , or even too much , it may be . For the saving of breath ask me no questions , but come ! "
35309	35337	35338	35338	she	543	" Over yonder lie the outlying mountains of the Bears , and through them we needs must pass , to our great peril . Nay , friend , "
35349	35438	35338	35338	she	543	" it must be patience and wisdom to bring us through , and not the fallow blade of one man , though he be a good one . But look ! below there runs a stream through the first of the plain , and I see nought for it but we must now rest our bodies . Moreover I have a tale to tell thee which is burning my heart ; for maybe there will be a pardon to ask of thee moreover ; wherefore I fear thee . "
35442	35448	35440	35440	Walter	35	" How may that be ? "
35469	35487	35466	35466	he	35	" Thou sayest , rest ; but are we now out of all peril of the chase ? "
35491	35532	35488	35488	She	543	" I can not tell till I know what hath befallen her . If she be not to hand to set on her trackers , they will scarce happen on us now ; if it be not for that one . "
35552	35598	35549	35549	she	543	" But peril or no peril , needs must we rest ; for I tell thee again , what I have to say to thee burneth my bosom for fear of thee , so that I can go no further until I have told thee . "
35603	35643	35600	35600	he	35	" I wot not of this Queen and her mightiness and her servants . I will ask thereof later . But besides the others , is there not the King 's Son , he who loves thee so unworthily ? "
35651	35687	35644	35644	She	999	" As for him , there had been nought for thee to fear in him , save his treason : but now shall he neither love nor hate any more ; he died last midnight . "
35688	35694	35696	35696	Walter	35	" Yea , and how ? "
35698	35701	35702	35702	she	999	" Nay , "
35705	35748	35702	35702	she	999	" let me tell my tale all together once for all , lest thou blame me overmuch . But first we will wash us and comfort us as best we may , and then amidst our resting shall the word be said . "
35777	35804	35774	35774	She	999	" There behind the great grey rock is my bath , friend ; and here is thine ; and lo ! the uprising of the sun ! "
35963	36022	35958	35958	she	999	" My friend , now shall I tell thee what I have done for thee and me ; and if thou have a mind to blame me , and punish me , yet remember first , that what I have done has been for thee and our hope of happy life . Well , I shall tell thee - "
36352	36367	36350	36350	he	35	" Fool ! thou shalt go free if thou wilt give up the Enemy . "
36368	36372	36374	36374	Walter	35	" And who , "
36376	36381	36350	36350	he	35	" is the Enemy ? "
36386	36449	36383	36384	the Dwarf	182	" She , the pink and white thing lying there ; she is not dead yet ; she is but dying for fear of me . Yea , she hath reason ! I could have set the shaft in her heart as easily as scratching her arm ; but I need her body alive , that I may wreak me on her . "
36450	36458	36460	36460	Walter	35	" What wilt thou do with her ? "
36509	36551	36506	36506	he	182	" What will I with her ? Let me at her , and stand by and look on , and then shalt thou have a strange tale to carry off with thee . For I will let thee go this while . "
36555	36570	36506	36506	he	182	" But what need to wreak thee ? What hath she done to thee ? "
36571	36578	36580	36581	the Dwarf	182	" What need ! what need ! "
36583	36641	36580	36581	the Dwarf	182	" have I not told thee that she is the Enemy ? And thou askest of what she hath done ! of what ! Fool , she is the murderer ! she hath slain the Lady that was our Lady , and that made us ; she whom all we worshipped and adored . O impudent fool ! "
36788	36804	36779	36779	he	182	" Up , Maiden , up ! and tell me this tale of the slaying . "
36823	36835	36806	36806	she	543	" What hast thou done with him ? Is he gone ? "
36836	36841	36843	36843	Walter	35	" He is dead , "
36845	36907	36843	36843	Walter	35	" I have slain him ; there lies he with cloven skull on the bent - side : unless , forsooth , he vanish away like the lion I slew ! or else , perchance , he will come to life again ! And art thou a lie like to the rest of them ? let me hear of this slaying . "
36921	36994	36908	36908	She	543	" O , thou art angry with me , and thine anger I can not bear . Ah , what have I done ? Thou hast slain one , and I , maybe , the other ; and never had we escaped till both these twain were dead . Ah ! thou dost not know ! thou dost not know ! O me ! what shall I do to appease thy wrath ! "
37147	37156	37135	37135	she	543	" O now thou art kind to me . "
37157	37160	37162	37162	he	182	" Yea , "
37164	37254	37162	37162	he	182	" and true it is that if thou hast slain , I have done no less , and if thou hast lied , even so have I ; and if thou hast played the wanton , as I deem not that thou hast , I full surely have so done . So now thou shalt pardon me , and when thy spirit has come back to thee , thou shalt tell me thy tale in all friendship , and in all loving - kindness will I hearken the same . "
37269	37302	37266	37266	she	1027	" Yea , yea ; what thou willest , that will I do . But first tell me one thing . Hast thou buried this horror and hidden him in the earth ? "
37326	37355	37323	37323	he	182	" Fair sweet friend , I have not done it as yet ; but now will I go and do it , if it seem good to thee . "
37356	37359	37360	37360	she	1027	" Yea , "
37363	37407	37360	37360	she	1027	" but first must thou smite off his head , and lie it by his buttocks when he is in the earth ; or evil things will happen else . This of the burying is no idle matter , I bid thee believe . "
37408	37414	37416	37416	he	182	" I doubt it not , "
37433	37450	37416	37416	he	182	" And he picked up his sword , and turned to go to the field of deed .
37454	37478	37451	37451	She	1027	" I must needs go with thee ; terror hath so filled my soul , that I durst not abide here without thee . "
37608	37619	37596	37596	Walter	35	" Now , sweetling , shall the story be told . "
37620	37625	37626	37626	she	543	" Nay , friend , "
37629	37677	37626	37626	she	543	" not here . This place hath been polluted by my craven fear , and the horror of the vile wretch , of whom no words may tell his vileness . Let us hence and onward . Thou seest I have once more come to life again . "
37678	37681	37683	37683	he	35	" But , "
37685	37696	37683	37683	he	35	" thou hast been hurt by the Dwarf 's arrow . "
37703	37736	37697	37697	She	543	" Had I never had greater hurt from them than that , little had been the tale thereof : yet whereas thou lookest dolorous about it , we will speedily heal it . "
37804	37839	37801	37801	he	35	" Thou art all unshod ; and but if that be seen to , our journey shall be stayed by thy foot - soreness : I may make a shift to fashion thee brogues . "
37843	37878	37840	37840	She	543	" I may well go barefoot . And in any case , I entreat thee that we tarry here no longer , but go away hence , if it be but for a mile . "
37952	37987	37950	37950	Walter	35	" Now will I cut thee the brogues from the skirt of my buff - coat , which shall be well meet for such work ; and meanwhile shalt thou tell me thy tale . "
37988	37993	37994	37994	she	543	" Thou art kind , "
37997	38129	38131	38131	she	543	" but be kinder yet , and abide my tale till we have done our day 's work . For we were best to make no long delay here ; because , though thou hast slain the King - dwarf , yet there be others of his kindred , who swarm in some parts of the wood as the rabbits in a warren . Now true it is that they have but little understanding , less , it may be , than the very brute beasts ; and that , as I said afore , unless they be set on our slot like to hounds , they shall have no inkling of where to seek us , yet might they happen upon us by mere misadventure . And moreover , friend , "
38135	38216	38131	38131	she	543	" I would beg of thee some little respite ; for though I scarce fear thy wrath any more , since thou hast been so kind to me , yet is there shame in that which I have to tell thee . Wherefore , since the fairest of the day is before us , let us use it all we may , and , when thou hast done me my new foot - gear , get us gone forward again . "
38264	38325	38249	38249	she	543	" Now am I hale and strong again , what with the rest , and what with thy loving - kindness , and thou shalt see how nimble I shall be to leave this land , for as fair as it is . Since forsooth a land of lies it is , and of grief to the children of Adam . "
38458	38517	38453	38453	herself	543	" Friend , no further will thy friend go this even ; nay , to say sooth , she can not . So now we will eat of thy venison , and then shall my tale be , since I may no longer delay it ; and thereafter shall our slumber be sweet and safe as I deem . "
38673	39175	38665	38666	THE MAID	72	" Now , friend , by the clear of the moon and this firelight will I tell what I may and can of my tale . Thus it is : If I be wholly of the race of Adam I wot not nor can I tell thee how many years old I may be . For there are , as it were , shards or gaps in my life , wherein are but a few things dimly remembered , and doubtless many things forgotten . I remember well when I was a little child , and right happy , and there were people about me whom I loved , and who loved me . It was not in this land ; but all things were lovely there ; the year 's beginning , the happy mid - year , the year 's waning , the year 's ending , and then again its beginning . That passed away , and then for a while is more than dimness , for nought I remember save that I was . Thereafter I remember again , and am a young maiden , and I know some things , and long to know more . I am nowise happy ; I am amongst people who bid me go , and I go ; and do this , and I do it : none loveth me , none tormenteth me ; but I wear my heart in longing for I scarce know what . Neither then am I in this land , but in a land that I love not , and a house that is big and stately , but nought lovely . Then is a dim time again , and sithence a time not right clear ; an evil time , wherein I am older , wellnigh grown to womanhood . There are a many folk about me , and they foul , and greedy , and hard ; and my spirit is fierce , and my body feeble ; and I am set to tasks that I would not do , by them that are unwiser than I ; and smitten I am by them that are less valiant than I ; and I know lack , and stripes , and divers misery . But all that is now become but a dim picture to me , save that amongst all these unfriends is a friend to me ; an old woman , who telleth me sweet tales of other life , wherein all is high and goodly , or at the least valiant and doughty , and she setteth hope in my heart and learneth me , and maketh me to know much . . . O much . . . so that at last I am grown wise , and wise to be mighty if I durst . Yet am I nought in this land all this while , but , as meseemeth , in a great and a foul city . "
39176	39391	38665	38666	THE MAID	72	" And then , as it were , I fall asleep ; and in my sleep is nought , save here and there a wild dream , somedeal lovely , somedeal hideous : but of this dream is my Mistress a part , and the monster , withal , whose head thou didst cleave to - day . But when I am awaken from it , then am I verily in this land , and myself , as thou seest me to - day . And the first part of my life here is this , that I am in the pillared ball yonder , half - clad and with bound hands ; and the Dwarf leadeth me to the Lady , and I hear his horrible croak as he sayeth : ' Lady , will this one do ? ' and then the sweet voice of the Lady saying : ' This one will do ; thou shalt have thy reward : now , set thou the token upon her . ' Then I remember the Dwarf dragging me away , and my heart sinking for fear of him : but for that time he did me no more harm than the rivetting upon my leg this iron ring which here thou seest . "
39392	39878	38665	38666	THE MAID	72	" So from that time forward I have lived in this land , and been the thrall of the Lady ; and I remember my life here day by day , and no part of it has fallen into the dimness of dreams . Thereof will I tell thee but little : but this I will tell thee , that in spite of my past dreams , or it may be because of them , I had not lost the wisdom which the old woman had erst learned me , and for more wisdom I longed . Maybe this longing shall now make both thee and me happy , but for the passing time it brought me grief . For at first my Mistress was indeed wayward with me , but as any great lady might be with her bought thrall , whiles caressing me , and whiles chastising me , as her mood went ; but she seemed not to be cruel of malice , or with any set purpose . But so it was rather little by little than by any great sudden uncovering of my intent , that she came to know that I also had some of the wisdom whereby she lived her queenly life . That was about two years after I was first her thrall , and three weary years have gone by since she began to see in me the enemy of her days . Now why or wherefore I know not , but it seemeth that it would not avail her to slay me outright , or suffer me to die ; but nought withheld her from piling up griefs and miseries on my head . At last she set her servant , the Dwarf , upon me , even he whose head thou clavest to - day . Many things I bore from him whereof it were unseemly for my tongue to tell before thee ; but the time came when he exceeded , and I could bear no more ; and then I showed him this sharp knife wherewith I would have thrust me through to the heart if thou hadst not pardoned me e'en now , and I told him that if he forbore me not , I would slay , not him , but myself ; and this he might not away with because of the commandment of the Lady , who had given him the word that in any case I must be kept living . And her hand , withal , fear held somewhat hereafter . Yet was there need to me of all my wisdom ; for with all this her hatred grew , and whiles raged within her so furiously that it overmastered her fear , and at such times she would have put me to death if I had not escaped her by some turn of my lore . "
39879	40105	40107	40107	she	1049	" Now further , I shall tell thee that somewhat more than a year ago hither to this land came the King 's Son , the second goodly man , as thou art the third , whom her sorceries have drawn hither since I have dwelt here . Forsooth , when he first came , he seemed to us , to me , and yet more to my Lady , to be as beautiful as an angel , and sorely she loved him ; and he her , after his fashion : but he was light - minded , and cold - hearted , and in a while he must needs turn his eyes upon me , and offer me his love , which was but foul and unkind as it turned out ; for when I nay - said him , as maybe I had not done save for fear of my Mistress , he had no pity upon me , but spared not to lead me into the trap of her wrath , and leave me without help , or a good word . But , O friend , in spite of all grief and anguish , I learned still , and waxed wise , and wiser , abiding the day of my deliverance , which has come , and thou art come . "
40134	40333	40130	40130	she	1049	" But sithence , months ago , the Lady began to weary of this dastard , despite of his beauty ; and then it was thy turn to be swept into her net ; I partly guess how . For on a day in broad daylight , as I was serving my Mistress in the hall , and the Evil Thing , whose head is now cloven , was lying across the threshold of the door , as it were a dream fell upon me , though I strove to cast it off for fear of chastisement ; for the pillared hall wavered , and vanished from my sight , and my feet were treading a rough stone pavement instead of the marble wonder of the hall , and there was the scent of the salt sea and of the tackle of ships , and behind me were tall houses , and before me the ships indeed , with their ropes beating and their sails flapping and their masts wavering ; and in mine ears was the hale and how of mariners ; things that I had seen and heard in the dimness of my life gone by . "
40334	40385	40130	40130	she	1049	" And there was I , and the Dwarf before me , and the Lady after me , going over the gangway aboard of a tall ship , and she gathered way and was gotten out of the haven , and straightway I saw the mariners cast abroad their ancient . "
40389	40419	40387	40387	Walter	35	" What then ! Sawest thou the blazon thereon , of a wolf - like beast ramping up against a maiden ? And that might well have been thou . "
40423	40528	40420	40420	She	1050	" Yea , so it was ; but refrain thee , that I may tell on my tale ! The ship and the sea vanished away , but I was not back in the hall of the Golden House ; and again were we three in the street of the self - same town which we had but just left ; but somewhat dim was my vision thereof , and I saw little save the door of a goodly house before me , and speedily it died out , and we were again in the pillared hall , wherein my thralldom was made manifest . "
40529	40532	40534	40534	Walter	35	" Maiden , "
40536	40558	40534	40534	Walter	35	" one question I would ask thee ; to wit , didst thou see me on the quay by the ships ? "
40559	40562	40563	40563	she	1051	" Nay , "
40566	40655	40563	40563	she	1051	" there were many folk about , but they were all as images of the aliens to me . Now hearken further : three months thereafter came the dream upon me again , when we were all three together in the Pillared Hall ; and again was the vision somewhat dim . Once more we were in the street of a busy town , but all unlike to that other one , and there were men standing together on our right hands by the door of a house . "
40656	40661	40534	40534	Walter	35	" Yea , yea , "
40665	40677	40663	40663	Walter	35	" and , forsooth , one of them was who but I. "
40678	40684	40685	40685	she	1051	" Refrain thee , beloved ! "
40688	40988	40685	40685	she	1051	" for my tale draweth to its ending , and I would have thee hearken heedfully : for maybe thou shalt once again deem my deed past pardon . Some twenty days after this last dream , I had some leisure from my Mistress 's service , so I went to disport me by the Well of the Oak - tree or forsooth she might have set in my mind the thought of going there , that I might meet thee and give her some occasion against me ; and I sat thereby , nowise loving the earth , but sick at heart , because of late the King 's Son had been more than ever instant with me to yield him my body , threatening me else with casting me into all that the worst could do to me of torments and shames day by day . I say my heart failed me , and I was wellnigh brought to the point of yea- saying his desires , that I might take the chance of something befalling me that were less bad than the worst . But here must I tell thee a thing , and pray thee to take it to heart . This , more than aught else , had given me strength to nay - say that dastard , that my wisdom both hath been , and now is , the wisdom of a wise maid , and not of a woman , and all the might thereof shall I lose with my maidenhead . Evil wilt thou think of me then , for all I was tried so sore , that I was at point to cast it all away , so wretchedly as I shrank from the horror of the Lady 's wrath . "
40989	41079	41139	41139	She	1052	" But there as I sat pondering these things , I saw a man coming , and thought no otherwise thereof but that it was the King 's Son , till I saw the stranger drawing near , and his golden hair , and his grey eyes ; and then I heard his voice , and his kindness pierced my heart , and I knew that my friend had come to see me ; and O , friend , these tears are for the sweetness of that past hour ! "
41083	41138	41081	41081	Walter	35	" I came to see my friend , I also . Now have I noted what thou badest me ; and I will forbear all as thou commandest me , till we be safe out of the desert and far away from all evil things ; but wilt thou ban me from all caresses ? "
41149	41164	41139	41139	She	1052	" O , nay , poor lad , if thou wilt be but wise . "
41201	41261	41198	41198	she	1052	" Alas , friend ! even yet mayst thou doom me guilty , and all thy love may turn away from me , when I have told thee all that I have done for the sake of thee and me . O , if then there might be some chastisement for the guilty woman , and not mere sundering ! "
41262	41268	41270	41270	he	35	" Fear nothing , sweetling , "
41272	41287	41270	41270	he	35	" for indeed I deem that already I know partly what thou hast done . "
41294	41869	41288	41288	She	1052	" I will tell thee next , that I banned thy kissing and caressing of me till to - day because I knew that my Mistress would surely know if a man , if thou , hadst so much as touched a finger of mine in love , it was to try me herein that on the morning of the hunting she kissed and embraced me , till I almost died thereof , and showed thee my shoulder and my limbs ; and to try thee withal , if thine eye should glister or thy cheek flush thereat ; for indeed she was raging in jealousy of thee . Next , my friend , even whiles we were talking together at the Well of the Rock , I was pondering on what we should do to escape from this land of lies . Maybe thou wilt say : Why didst thou not take my hand and flee with me as we fled to - day ? Friend , it is most true , that were she not dead we had not escaped thus far . For her trackers would have followed us , set on by her , and brought us back to an evil fate . Therefore I tell thee that from the first I did plot the death of those two , the Dwarf and the Mistress . For no otherwise mightest thou live , or I escape from death in life . But as to the dastard who threatened me with a thrall 's pains , I heeded him nought to live or die , for well I knew that thy valiant sword , yea , or thy bare hands , would speedily tame him . Now first I knew that I must make a show of yielding to the King 's Son ; and somewhat how I did therein , thou knowest . But no night and no time did I give him to bed me , till after I had met thee as thou wentest to the Golden House , before the adventure of fetching the lion 's skin ; and up to that time I had scarce known what to do , save ever to bid thee , with sore grief and pain , to yield thee to the wicked woman 's desire . But as we spake together there by the stream , and I saw that the Evil Thing whose head thou clavest e'en now was spying on us , then amidst the sickness of terror which ever came over me whensoever I thought of him , and much more when I saw him ah ! he is dead now ! , it came flashing into my mind how I might destroy my enemy . Therefore I made the Dwarf my messenger to her , by bidding thee to my bed in such wise that he might hear it . And wot thou well , that he speedily carried her the tidings . Meanwhile I hastened to lie to the King 's Son , and all privily bade him come to me and not thee . And thereafter , by dint of waiting and watching , and taking the only chance that there was , I met thee as thou camest back from fetching the skin of the lion that never was , and gave thee that warning , or else had we been undone indeed . "
41873	41885	41871	41871	Walter	35	" Was the lion of her making or of thine then ? "
41889	41902	41886	41886	She	1053	" Of hers : why should I deal with such a matter ? "
41903	41906	41908	41908	Walter	35	" Yea , "
41910	41925	41908	41908	Walter	35	" but she verily swooned , and she was verily wroth with the Enemy . "
41933	42005	41926	41927	The Maid	543	" If her lie was not like very sooth , then had she not been the crafts - master that I knew her : one may lie otherwise than with the tongue alone : yet indeed her wrath against the Enemy was nought feigned ; for the Enemy was even I , and in these latter days never did her wrath leave me . But to go on with my tale . "
42006	42101	41926	41927	The Maid	543	" Now doubt thou not , that , when thou camest into the hall yester eve , the Mistress knew of thy counterfeit tryst with me , and meant nought but death for thee ; yet first would she have thee in her arms again , therefore did she make much of thee at table and that was partly for my torment also , and therefore did she make that tryst with thee , and deemed doubtless that thou wouldst not dare to forgo it , even if thou shouldst go to me thereafter . "
42102	42264	41926	41927	The Maid	543	" Now I had trained that dastard to me as I have told thee , but I gave him a sleepy draught , so that when I came to the bed he might not move toward me nor open his eyes : but I lay down beside him , so that the Lady might know that my body had been there ; for well had she wotted if it had not . Then as there I lay I cast over him thy shape , so that none might have known but that thou wert lying by my side , and there , trembling , I abode what should befall . Thus I passed through the hour whenas thou shouldest have been at her chamber , and the time of my tryst with thee was come as the Mistress would be deeming ; so that I looked for her speedily , and my heart wellnigh failed me for fear of her cruelty . "
42265	42748	41926	41927	The Maid	543	" Presently then I heard a stirring in her chamber , and I slipped from out the bed , and hid me behind the hangings , and was like to die for fear of her ; and lo , presently she came stealing in softly , holding a lamp in one hand and a knife in the other . And I tell thee of a sooth that I also had a sharp knife in my hand to defend my life if need were . She held the lamp up above her head before she drew near to the bed - side , and I heard her mutter : ' She is not there then ! but she shall be taken . ' Then she went up to the bed and stooped over it , and laid her hand on the place where I had lain ; and therewith her eyes turned to that false image of thee lying there , and she fell a - trembling and shaking , and the lamp fell to the ground and was quenched but there was bright moonlight in the room , and still I could see what betid . But she uttered a noise like the low roar of a wild beast , and I saw her arm and hand rise up , and the flashing of the steel beneath the hand , and then down came the hand and the steel , and I went nigh to swooning lest perchance I had wrought over well , and thine image were thy very self . The dastard died without a groan : why should I lament him ? I can not . But the Lady drew him toward her , and snatched the clothes from off his shoulders and breast , and fell a - gibbering sounds mostly without meaning , but broken here and there with words . Then I heard her say : ' I shall forget ; I shall forget ; and the new days shall come . ' Then was there silence of her a little , and thereafter she cried out in a terrible voice : ' O no , no , no ! I can not forget ; I can not forget ; ' and she raised a great wailing cry that filled all the night with horror didst thou not hear it ? , and caught up the knife from the bed and thrust it into her breast , and fell down a dead heap over the bed and on to the man whom she had slain . And then I thought of thee , and joy smote across my terror ; how shall I gainsay it ? And I fled away to thee , and I took thine hands in mine , thy dear hands , and we fled away together . Shall we be still together ? "
42776	42966	42773	42773	He	1055	" I think thou hast told me all ; and whether thy guile slew her , or her own evil heart , she was slain last night who lay in mine arms the night before . It was ill , and ill done of me , for I loved not her , but thee , and I wished for her death that I might be with thee . Thou wottest this , and still thou lovest me , it may be overweeningly . What have I to say then ? If there be any guilt of guile , I also was in the guile ; and if there be any guilt of murder , I also was in the murder . Thus we say to each other ; and to God and his Hallows we say : ' We two have conspired to slay the woman who tormented one of us , and would have slain the other ; and if we have done amiss therein , then shall we two together pay the penalty ; for in this have we done as one body and one soul . ' "
42997	43041	42992	42992	he	1057	" Maybe to - morrow , in the sunlight , I will ask thee of this woman , what she verily was ; but now let her be . And thou , thou art over - wearied , and I bid thee sleep . "
43242	43316	43238	43239	the Maid	543	" My Master , thou seest we be come nigh unto the hill - country , and to - day about sunset , belike , we shall come into the Land of the Bear - folk ; and both it is , that there is peril if we fall into their hands , and that we may scarce escape them . Yet I deem that we may deal with the peril by wisdom . "
43317	43323	43325	43325	Walter	35	" What is the peril ? "
43327	43338	43325	43325	Walter	35	" I mean , what is the worst of it ? "
43343	43354	43340	43341	the Maid	543	" To be offered up in sacrifice to their God . "
43355	43368	43370	43370	Walter	35	" But if we escape death at their hands , what then ? "
43372	43378	43380	43380	she	543	" One of two things , "
43382	43394	43380	43380	she	543	" the first that they shall take us into their tribe . "
43395	43405	43407	43407	Walter	35	" And will they sunder us in that case ? "
43409	43412	43414	43414	she	543	" Nay , "
43421	43435	43416	43416	Walter	35	" Therein is little harm then . But what is the other chance ? "
43439	43459	43437	43437	she	543	" That we leave them with their goodwill , and come back to one of the lands of Christendom . "
43463	43512	43461	43461	Walter	35	" I am not all so sure that this is the better of the two choices , though , forsooth , thou seemest to think so . But tell me now , what like is their God , that they should offer up new - comers to him ? "
43513	43520	43521	43521	she	543	" Their God is a woman , "
43524	43549	43521	43521	she	543	" and the Mother of their nation and tribes or so they deem before the days when they had chieftains and Lords of Battle . "
43550	43557	43559	43559	he	35	" That will be long ago , "
43561	43570	43559	43559	he	35	" how then may she be living now ? "
43575	43666	43572	43573	the Maid	543	" Doubtless that woman of yore agone is dead this many and many a year ; but they take to them still a new woman , one after other , as they may happen on them , to be in the stead of the Ancient Mother . And to tell thee the very truth right out , she that lieth dead in the Pillared Hall was even the last of these ; and now , if they knew it , they lack a God . This shall we tell them . "
43667	43672	43674	43674	Walter	35	" Yea , yea ! "
43676	43703	43674	43674	Walter	35	" a goodly welcome shall we have of them then , if we come amongst them with our hands red with the blood of their God ! "
43711	43744	43704	43704	She	1068	" If I come amongst them with the tidings that I have slain her , and they trow therein , without doubt they shall make me Lady and Goddess in her stead . "
43745	43752	43754	43754	Walter	35	" This is a strange word , "
43755	43782	43704	43704	She	1068	" but if so they do , how shall that further us in reaching the kindreds of the world , and the folk of Holy Church ? "
43809	43812	43813	43813	she	1068	" Sweetheart , "
43816	43892	43813	43813	she	1068	" now I see that thou desirest wholly what I desire ; yet in any case , abiding with them would be living and not dying , even as thou hadst it e'en now . But , forsooth , they will not hinder our departure if they deem me their God ; they do not look for it , nor desire it , that their God should dwell with them daily . Have no fear . "
43901	43971	43894	43894	she	1068	" What ! thou lookest on me and deemest me to be but a sorry image of a goddess ; and me with my scanty coat and bare arms and naked feet ! But wait ! I know well how to array me when the time cometh . Thou shalt see it ! And now , my Master , were it not meet that we took to the road ? "
44120	44135	44114	44115	the Maid	543	" Now shall the Queen array herself , and seem like a very goddess . "
44258	44308	44252	44252	her	543	" Lo now ! am I not as like to the Mother of Summer as if I were clad in silk and gold ? and even so shall I be deemed by the folk of the Bear . Come now , thou shalt see how all shall be well . "
44365	44505	44351	44351	Walter	35	" One thing I would say to thee , lovely friend , to wit : wert thou clad in silk and gold , thy stately raiment might well suffer a few stains , or here and there a rent maybe ; but stately would it be still when the folk of the Bear should come up against thee . But as to this flowery array of thine , in a few hours it shall be all faded and nought . Nay , even now , as I look on thee , the meadow - sweet that hangeth from thy girdle - stead has waxen dull , and welted ; and the blossoming eyebright that is for a hem to the little white coat of thee is already forgetting how to be bright and blue . What sayest thou then ? "
44547	44559	44544	44544	she	543	" Is it verily so as thou sayest ? Look again ! "
44635	44729	44632	44632	she	543	" Dear friend , be not troubled ! did I not tell thee that I am wise in hidden lore ? But in my wisdom shall be no longer any scathe to any man . And again , this my wisdom , as I told thee erst , shall end on the day whereon I am made all happy . And it is thou that shall wield it all , my Master . Yet must my wisdom needs endure for a little season yet . Let us on then , boldly and happily . "
45108	45124	45083	45083	he	35	" Are these then the children of the Bear ? What shall we do now ? "
45128	45201	45125	45125	She	1105	" Yea , of the Bear they be , though there be other folks of them far and far away to the northward and eastward , near to the borders of the sea . And as to what we shall do , let us go down at once , and peacefully . Indeed , by now there will be no escape from them ; for lo you ! they have seen us . "
45513	45548	45504	45504	her	543	" Hail , ye folk of the Bears ! we have come amongst you , and that for your good and not for your hurt : wherefore we would know if we be welcome . "
45596	45779	45593	45593	he	1121	" Little are ye , but so goodly , that if ye were but bigger , we should deem that ye were come from the Gods ' House . Yet have I heard , that how mighty soever may the Gods be , and chiefly our God , they be at whiles nought so bigly made as we of the Bears . How this may be , I wot not . But if ye be not of the Gods or their kindred , then are ye mere aliens ; and we know not what to do with aliens , save we meet them in battle , or give them to the God , or save we make them children of the Bear . But yet again , ye may be messengers of some folk who would bind friendship and alliance with us : in which case ye shall at the least depart in peace , and whiles ye are with us shall be our guests in all good cheer . Now , therefore , we bid you declare the matter unto us . "
45785	45830	45782	45783	the Maid	543	" Father , it were easy for us to declare what we be unto you here present . But , meseemeth , ye who be gathered round the fire here this evening are less than the whole tale of the children of the Bear . "
45831	45838	45840	45841	the elder	127	" So it is , Maiden , "
45843	45852	45840	45841	the elder	127	" that many more children hath the Bear . "
45853	45860	45862	45863	the Maid	543	" This then we bid you , "
45865	45910	45862	45863	the Maid	543	" that ye send the tokens round and gather your people to you , and when they be assembled in the Doom - ring , then shall we put our errand before you ; and according to that , shall ye deal with us . "
45911	45917	45919	45920	the elder	127	" Thou hast spoken well , "
45922	45960	45919	45920	the elder	127	" and even so had we bidden you ourselves . To - morrow , before noon , shall ye stand in the Doom - ring in this Dale , and speak with the children of the Bear . "
46095	46137	46081	46082	the elder	127	" Man and woman , whatsoever ye may be , or whatsoever may abide you to - morrow , to - night , ye are welcome guests to us ; so we bid you come eat and drink at our fire . "
46425	46534	46416	46416	Walter	35	" Sweet and dear friend , I have come a long way from the quay at Langton , and the vision of the Dwarf , the Maid , and the Lady ; and for this kiss wherewith I have kissed thee e'en now , and the kindness of thine eyes , it was worth the time and the travail . But to - morrow , meseemeth , I shall go no further in this world , though my journey be far longer than from Langton hither . And now may God and All Hallows keep thee amongst this wild folk , whenas I shall be gone from thee . "
46544	46653	46535	46535	She	1146	" Dear friend , dost thou speak to me thus mournfully to move me to love thee better ? Then is thy labour lost ; for no better may I love thee than now I do ; and that is with mine whole heart . But keep a good courage , I bid thee ; for we be not sundered yet , nor shall we be . Nor do I deem that we shall die here , or to - morrow ; but many years hence , after we have known all the sweetness of life . Meanwhile , I bid thee good - night , fair friend ! "
46755	46813	46745	46745	he	35	" How thou art fair and bright this morning ! And yet . . . and yet . . . were it not well that thou do off thee all this faded and drooping bravery of leaves and blossoms , that maketh thee look like to a jongleur 's damsel on a morrow of May - day ? "
46830	46907	46821	46821	She	543	" Yea , and belike these others think no better of my attire , or not much better ; for yonder they are gathering small wood for the burnt - offering ; which , forsooth , shall be thou and I , unless I better it all by means of the wisdom I learned of the old woman , and perfected betwixt the stripes of my Mistress , whom a little while ago thou lovedst somewhat . "
46986	47049	46983	46983	she	543	" Look up , and into mine eyes , friend , and see if there be in them any falseness toward thee ! For I know thy thought ; I know thy thought . Dost thou not see that my joy and gladness is for the love of thee , and the thought of the rest from trouble that is at hand ? "
47081	47332	47075	47075	she	543	" Nay , thou must refrain thee awhile , dear friend , lest these folk cast eyes on us , and deem us over lover - like for what I am to bid them deem me . Abide a while , and then shall all be in me according to thy will . But now I must tell thee that it is not very far from noon , and that the Bears are streaming into the Dale , and already there is an host of men at the Doom- ring , and , as I said , the bale for the burnt - offering is wellnigh dight , whether it be for us , or for some other creature . And now I have to bid thee this , and it will be a thing easy for thee to do , to wit , that thou look as if thou wert of the race of the Gods , and not to blench , or show sign of blenching , whatever betide : to yea - say both my yea - say and my nay- say : and lastly this , which is the only hard thing for thee but thou hast already done it before somewhat , to look upon me with no masterful eyes of love , nor as if thou wert at once praying me and commanding me ; rather thou shalt so demean thee as if thou wert my man all simply , and nowise my master . "
47333	47338	47340	47340	Walter	35	" O friend beloved , "
47342	47375	47340	47340	Walter	35	" here at least art thou the master , and I will do all thy bidding , in certain hope of this , that either we shall live together or die together . "
47630	47799	47625	47627	the old man	208	" My children , ye shall now come with me unto the Doom - ring of our folk , the Bears of the Southern Dales , and deliver to them your errand ; and I beseech you to have pity upon your own bodies , as I have pity on them ; on thine especially , Maiden , so fair and bright a creature as thou art ; for so it is , that if ye deal us out light and lying words after the manner of dastards , ye shall miss the worship and glory of wending away amidst of the flames , a gift to the God and a hope to the people , and shall be passed by the rods of the folk , until ye faint and fail amongst them , and then shall ye be thrust down into the flow at the Dale 's End , and a stone - laden hurdle cast upon you , that we may thenceforth forget your folly . "
47824	47860	47821	47821	she	543	" Thou art old and wise , O great man of the Bears , yet nought I need to learn of thee . Now lead us on our way to the Stead of the Errands . "
48209	48416	48202	48204	the old chief	1193	" Ye men , here are come a man and a woman , we know not whence ; whereas they have given word to our folk who first met them , that they would tell their errand to none save the Mote of the People ; which it was their due to do , if they were minded to risk it . For either they be aliens without an errand hither , save , it may be , to beguile us , in which case they shall presently die an evil death ; or they have come amongst us that we may give them to the God with flint- edge and fire ; or they have a message to us from some folk or other , on the issue of which lieth life or death . Now shall ye hear what they have to say concerning themselves and their faring hither . But , meseemeth , it shall be the woman who is the chief and hath the word in her mouth ; for , lo you ! the man kneeleth at her feet , as one who would serve and worship her . Speak out then , woman , and let our warriors hear thee . "
48443	48471	48422	48422	her	543	" Ye men of the Children of the Bear , I would ask you a question , and let the chieftain who sitteth before me answer it . "
48484	48516	48480	48480	she	543	" Tell me , Children of the Bear , how long a time is worn since ye saw the God of your worship made manifest in the body of a woman ! "
48521	48548	48518	48519	the elder	127	" Many winters have worn since my father 's father was a child , and saw the very God in the bodily form of a woman . "
48554	48574	48550	48550	she	543	" Did ye rejoice at her coming , and would ye rejoice if once more she came amongst you ? "
48575	48578	48580	48582	the old chieftain	1198	" Yea , "
48584	48615	48580	48582	the old chieftain	1198	" for she gave us gifts , and learned us lore , and came to us in no terrible shape , but as a young woman as goodly as thou . "
48621	48658	48618	48619	the Maid	543	" Now , then , is the day of your gladness come ; for the old body is dead , and I am the new body of your God , come amongst you for your welfare . "
48676	48873	48669	48671	the old man	208	" What shall I say and live ? For if thou be verily the God , and I threaten thee , wilt thou not destroy me ? But thou hast spoken a great word with a sweet mouth , and hast taken the burden of blood on thy lily hands ; and if the Children of the Bear be befooled of light liars , how shall they put the shame off them ? Therefore I say , show to us a token ; and if thou be the God , this shall be easy to thee ; and if thou show it not , then is thy falsehood manifest , and thou shalt dree the weird . For we shall deliver thee into the hands of these women here , who shall thrust thee down into the flow which is hereby , after they have wearied themselves with whipping thee . But thy man that kneeleth at thy feet shall we give to the true God , and he shall go to her by the road of the flint and the fire . Hast thou heard ? Then give to us the sign and the token . "
48927	49060	48913	48913	she	1201	" Old man , thou needest not to fear for thy words . Forsooth it is not me whom thou threatenest with stripes and a foul death , but some light fool and liar , who is not here . Now hearken ! I wot well that ye would have somewhat of me , to wit , that I should send you rain to end this drought , which otherwise seemeth like to lie long upon you : but this rain , I must go into the mountains of the south to fetch it you ; therefore shall certain of your warriors bring me on my way , with this my man , up to the great pass of the said mountains , and we shall set out thitherward this very day . "
49098	49210	49092	49092	she	1204	" Some would say , men of the Bear , that this were a sign and a token great enough ; but I know you , and how stubborn and perverse of heart ye be ; and how that the gift not yet within your hand is no gift to you ; and the wonder ye see not , your hearts trow not . Therefore look ye upon me as here I stand , I who have come from the fairer country and the greenwood of the lands , and see if I bear not the summer with me , and the heart that maketh increase and the hand that giveth . "
49605	49680	49588	49588	she	1204	" Nay ; deemest thou of me that I need bearing by men 's hands , or that I shall tire at all when I am doing my will , and I , the very heart of the year 's increase ? So it is , that the going of my feet over your pastures shall make them to thrive , both this year and the coming years : surely will I go afoot . "
49959	50240	49940	49940	she	543	" O men of the Bear , I give you thanks for your following , and I bless you , and promise you the increase of the earth . But now ye shall turn aback , and leave me to go my ways ; and my man with the iron sword shall follow me . Now , maybe , I shall come amongst the Bear - folk again before long , and yet again , and learn them wisdom ; but for this time it is enough . And I shall tell you that ye were best to hasten home straightway to your houses in the downland dales , for the weather which I have bidden for you is even now coming forth from the forge of storms in the heart of the mountains . Now this last word I give you , that times are changed since I wore the last shape of God that ye have seen , wherefore a change I command you . If so be aliens come amongst you , I will not that ye send them to me by the flint and the fire ; rather , unless they be baleful unto you , and worthy of an evil death , ye shall suffer them to abide with you ; ye shall make them become children of the Bears , if they be goodly enough and worthy , and they shall be my children as ye be ; otherwise , if they be ill - favoured and weakling , let them live and be thralls to you , but not join with you , man to woman . Now depart ye with my blessing . "
51281	51303	51266	51266	she	1270	" Forbear now , friend , for it is enough for this time , and tell me how thou hast sped . "
51304	51309	51311	51311	he	35	" Ill , ill , "
51313	51318	51319	51319	she	1270	" What ails thee ? "
51322	51325	51326	51326	he	35	" Hunger , "
51329	51335	51326	51326	he	35	" and longing for thee . "
51336	51339	51340	51340	she	1270	" Well , "
51343	51367	51340	51340	she	1270	" me thou hast ; there is one ill quenched ; take my hand , and we will see to the other one . "
51421	51429	51418	51418	he	35	" Who is at the cooking yonder ? "
51430	51435	51436	51436	she	1270	" Thou shalt see , "
51505	51511	51513	51513	she	1270	" Here is the breakfast , "
51515	51597	51513	51513	she	1270	" when it was time to wash the night off me e'en now , I went down the strand here into the rippling shallow , and saw the bank below it , where the water draws together yonder , and deepens , that it seemed like to hold fish ; and whereas I looked to meet thee presently , I groped the bank for them , going softly ; and lo thou ! Help me now , that we cook them . "
51663	51676	51657	51657	Walter	35	" And how didst thou know that thou shouldst see me presently ? "
51685	51711	51677	51677	She	543	" This needed no wizardry . I lay not so far from thee last night , but that I heard thy voice and knew it . "
51715	51732	51713	51713	he	35	" Why didst thou not come to me then , since thou heardest me bemoaning thee ? "
51750	51788	51733	51733	She	543	" It was dear to hear thee praising me ; I knew not before that I was so sore desired , or that thou hadst taken such note of my body , and found it so dear . "
51797	51813	51790	51790	she	543	" I knew not that aught of me had such beauty as thou didst bewail . "
51831	51882	51821	51821	she	543	" Wilt thou have the very truth of it ? I went close up to thee , and stood there hidden by the bushes and the night . And amidst thy bewailing , I knew that thou wouldst soon fall asleep , and in sooth I out - waked thee . "
51908	51936	51901	51901	she	543	" Furthermore , I must needs tell thee that I feared to go to thee in the dark night , and my heart so yearning towards thee . "
51948	52051	51945	51945	he	35	" Is it so indeed , that thou fearest me ? Then doth that make me afraid - afraid of thy nay - say . For I was going to entreat thee , and say to thee : Beloved , we have now gone through many troubles ; let us now take a good reward at once , and we d together , here amidst this sweet and pleasant house of the mountains , ere we go further on our way ; if indeed we go further at all . For where shall we find any place sweeter or happier than this ? "
52076	52259	52073	52073	she	543	" Beloved , I have deemed that it were good for us to go seek mankind as they live in the world , and to live amongst them . And as for me , I will tell thee the sooth , to wit , that I long for this sorely . For I feel afraid in the wilderness , and as if I needed help and protection against my Mistress , though she be dead ; and I need the comfort of many people , and the throngs of the cities . I can not forget her : it was but last night that I dreamed I suppose as the dawn grew a - cold that I was yet under her hand , and she was stripping me for the torment ; so that I woke up panting and crying out . I pray thee be not angry with me for telling thee of my desires ; for if thou wouldst not have it so , then here will I abide with thee as thy mate , and strive to gather courage . "
52271	52318	52260	52260	He	1279	" Nay , I had in sooth no mind to abide here for ever ; I meant but that we should feast a while here , and then depart : sooth it is , that if thou dreadest the wilderness , somewhat I dread the city . "
52326	52474	52319	52319	She	1280	" Thou shalt have thy will , my friend , if it must be so . But bethink thee we be not yet at our journey 's end , and may have many things and much strife to endure , before we be at peace and in welfare . Now shall I tell thee - did I not before ? - that while I am a maid untouched , my wisdom , and somedeal of might , abideth with me , and only so long . Therefore I entreat thee , let us go now , side by side , out of this fair valley , even as we are , so that my wisdom and might may help thee at need . For , my friend , I would not that our lives be short , so much of joy as hath now come into them . "
52475	52480	52481	52481	he	1281	" Yea , beloved , "
52484	52499	52481	52481	he	1281	" let us on straightway then , and shorten the while that sundereth us . "
52500	52503	52504	52504	she	1282	" Love , "
52507	52566	52504	52504	she	1282	" thou shalt pardon me one time for all . But this is to be said , that I know somewhat of the haps that lie a little way ahead of us ; partly by my lore , and partly by what I learned of this land of the wild folk whiles thou wert lying asleep that morning . "
52664	52716	52661	52662	the Maid	543	" O , dear friend , lo you ! is not that our abode that lieth yonder , and is so beauteous ? Dwell not our friends there , and our protection against uncouth wights , and mere evil things in guileful shapes ? O city , I bid thee hail ! "
52730	52791	52718	52718	Walter	35	" I rejoice in thy joy . But there be evil things in yonder city also , though they be not fays nor devils , or it is like to no city that I wot of . And in every city shall foes grow up to us without rhyme or reason , and life therein shall be tangled unto us . "
52792	52795	52796	52796	she	543	" Yea , "
52799	52878	52796	52796	she	543	" but in the wilderness amongst the devils , what was to be done by manly might or valiancy ? There hadst thou to fall back upon the guile and wizardry which I had filched from my very foes . But when we come down yonder , then shall thy valiancy prevail to cleave the tangle for us . Or at the least , it shall leave a tale of thee behind , and I shall worship thee . "
52888	52894	52883	52883	his	543	" Mastery mows the meadow , "
52898	52921	52896	52896	he	543	" and one man is of little might against many . But I promise thee I shall not be slothful before thee . "
53167	53224	53157	53157	her	543	" Here now are come the folk of the city for our welcoming , and fair and lovely are they , and of many things shall they be thinking , and a many things shall they do , and we shall be partakers thereof . Come then , and let us meet them , fair friend ! "
53229	53274	53226	53226	Walter	35	" Alas ! thou knowest not : would that we might flee ! But now is it over late ; so put we a good face on it , and go to them quietly , as erewhile we did in the Bear - country . "
54748	54771	54737	54737	he	35	" How long shall we speak no word to each other , or is it so that God hath stricken you dumb ? "
54781	54793	54774	54774	they	1367	" All hail to the King , the King of Battle ! "
54797	54813	54794	54795	Spake Walter	35	" If I be king , will ye do my will as I bid you ? "
54818	54833	54815	54816	the elder	127	" Nought have we will to do , lord , save as thou biddest . "
54837	54850	54835	54835	Walter	35	" Thou then , wilt thou answer a question in all truth ? "
54851	54856	54858	54859	the elder	127	" Yea , lord , "
54861	54868	54858	54859	the elder	127	" if I may live afterward . "
54873	54892	54871	54871	Walter	35	" The woman that came with me into your Camp of the Mountain , what hath befallen her ? "
54897	54932	54893	54894	The elder	127	" Nought hath befallen her , either of good or evil , save that she hath slept and eaten and bathed her . What , then , is the King 's pleasure concerning her ? "
54933	54943	54945	54945	Walter	35	" That ye bring her hither to me straightway , "
54947	54950	54952	54953	the elder	127	" Yea , "
54955	54979	54952	54953	the elder	127	" and in what guise shall we bring her hither ? shall she be arrayed as a servant , or a great lady ? "
54991	55078	54952	54953	the elder	127	" Ask her what is her will herein , and as she will have it , so let it be . But set ye another chair beside mine , and lead her thereto . Thou wise old man , send one or two to bring her in hither , but abide thou , for I have a question or two to ask of thee yet . And ye , lords , abide here the coming of my she - fellow , if it weary you not . "
55129	55170	55119	55120	the King	1780	" Now tell me whereof I am become king , and what is the fashion and cause of the king - making ; for wondrous it is to me , whereas I am but an alien amidst of mighty men . "
55171	55174	55176	55178	the old man	208	" Lord , "
55180	55786	55176	55178	the old man	208	" thou art become king of a mighty city , which hath under it many other cities and wide lands , and havens by the sea- side , and which lacketh no wealth which men desire . Many wise men dwell therein , and of fools not more than in other lands . A valiant host shall follow thee to battle when needs must thou wend afield ; an host not to be withstood , save by the ancient God - folk , if any of them were left upon the earth , as belike none are . And as to the name of our said city , it hight the City of the Stark - wall , or more shortly , Stark - wall . Now as to the fashion of our king - making : If our king dieth and leaveth an heir male , begotten of his body , then is he king after him ; but if he die and leave no heir , then send we out a great lord , with knights and sergeants , to that pass of the mountain whereto ye came yesterday ; and the first man that cometh unto them , they take and lead to the city , as they did with thee , lord . For we believe and trow that of old time our forefathers came down from the mountains by that same pass , poor and rude , but full of valiancy , before they conquered these lands , and builded the Stark- wall . But now furthermore , when we have gotten the said wanderer , and brought him home to our city , we behold him mother - naked , all the great men of us , both sages and warriors ; then if we find him ill - fashioned and counterfeit of his body , we roll him in a great carpet till he dies ; or whiles , if he be but a simple man , and without guile , we deliver him for thrall to some artificer amongst us , as a shoemaker , a wright , or what not , and so forget him . But in either case we make as if no such man had come to us , and we send again the lord and his knights to watch the pass ; for we say that such an one the Fathers of old time have not sent us . But again , when we have seen to the new - comer that he is well - fashioned of his body , all is not done ; for we deem that never would the Fathers send us a dolt or a craven to be our king . Therefore we bid the naked one take to him which he will of these raiments , either the ancient armour , which now thou bearest , lord , or this golden raiment here ; and if he take the war - gear , as thou takedst it , King , it is well ; but if he take the raiment of peace , then hath he the choice either to be thrall of some goodman of the city , or to be proven how wise he may be , and so fare the narrow edge betwixt death and kingship ; for if he fall short of his wisdom , then shall he die the death . Thus is thy question answered , King , and praise be to the Fathers that they have sent us one whom none may doubt , either for wisdom or valiancy . "
55810	55843	55806	55806	he	1780	" What is that noise that I hear without , as if it were the rising of the sea on a sandy shore , when the south - west wind is blowing . "
56009	56102	55989	55989	she	543	" O my lord , now I see that thou hast beguiled me , and that thou wert all along a king - born man coming home to thy realm . But so dear thou hast been to me ; and so fair and clear , and so kind withal do thine eyes shine on me from under the grey war - helm , that I will beseech thee not to cast me out utterly , but suffer me to be thy servant and handmaid for a while . Wilt thou not ? "
56141	56159	56131	56131	her	1390	" Sweetheart , this is now thy place till the night cometh , even by my side . "
56189	56235	56185	56186	the King	1780	" Lords , this is my beloved , and my spouse . Now , therefore , if ye will have me for King , ye must worship this one for Queen and Lady ; or else suffer us both to go our ways in peace . "
56248	56261	56238	56238	they	1392	" The Queen , the Lady ! The beloved of our lord ! "
56360	56371	56338	56338	they	1395	" The Queen , the Lady , the lovely one ! "
56418	56431	56411	56411	he	1780	" Tell us now of that noise withoutward , what is it ? "
56436	56495	56433	56434	the elder	127	" If thou , King , and the Queen , wilt but arise and stand in the window , and go forth into the hanging gallery thereof , then shall ye know at once what is this rumour , and therewithal shall ye see a sight meet to rejoice the heart of a king new come into kingship . "
56640	56676	56630	56631	the Maid	543	" Here then is the wilderness left behind a long way , and here is warding and protection against the foes of our life and soul . O blessed be thou and thy valiant heart ! "
56730	56777	56715	56721	two neighbours somewhat anigh to the window	1416	" See thou ! the new man in the ancient armour of the Battle of the Waters , bearing the sword that slew the foeman king on the Day of the Doubtful Onset ! Surely this is a sign of good - luck to us all . "
56778	56781	56783	56784	the second	1418	" Yea , "
56786	56822	56783	56784	the second	1418	" he beareth his armour well , and the eyes are bright in the head of him : but hast thou beheld well his she - fellow , and what the like of her is ? "
56823	56828	56830	56831	the other	922	" I see her , "
56833	56877	56830	56831	the other	922	" that she is a fair woman ; yet somewhat worse clad than simply . She is in her smock , man , and were it not for the balusters I deem ye should see her barefoot . What is amiss with her ? "
56878	56885	56887	56889	the second neighbour	1420	" Dost thou not see her , "
56891	57018	56887	56889	the second neighbour	1420	" that she is not only a fair woman , but yet more , one of those lovely ones that draw the heart out of a man 's body , one may scarce say for why ? Surely Stark - wall hath cast a lucky net this time . And as to her raiment , I see of her that she is clad in white and wreathed with roses , but that the flesh of her is so wholly pure and sweet that it maketh all her attire but a part of her body , and halloweth it , so that it hath the semblance of gems . Alas , my friend ! let us hope that this Queen will fare abroad unseldom amongst the people . "
57512	57573	57497	57497	he	1469	" Truly , neighbour , thou art in the right of it ; and now the Queen has been dight duly , and hath a crown on her head , and is clad in white samite done all over with pearls , I see her to be of exceeding goodliness ; as goodly , maybe , as the Lord King . "
57578	57685	57575	57576	the other	922	" Unto me she seemeth as she did e'en now ; she is clad in white , as then she was , and it is by reason of the pure and sweet flesh of her that the pearls shine out and glow , and by the holiness of her body is her rich attire hallowed ; but , forsooth , it seemed to me as she went past as though paradise had come anigh to our city , and that all the air breathed of it . So I say , praise be to God and His Hallows who hath suffered her to dwell amongst us ! "
57691	57715	57687	57689	the first man	1472	" Forsooth , it is well ; but knowest thou at all whence she cometh , and of what lineage she may be ? "
57716	57719	57721	57722	the other	922	" Nay , "
57724	57808	57721	57722	the other	922	" I wot not whence she is ; but this I wot full surely , that when she goeth away , they whom she leadeth with her shall be well bestead . Again , of her lineage nought know I ; but this I know , that they that come of her , to the twentieth generation , shall bless and praise the memory of her , and hallow her name little less than they hallow the name of the Mother of God . "
57921	57965	57904	57904	he	85	" Art thou not weary , sweetheart ? Doth not the city , and the thronging folk , and the watching eyes of the great ones . . . doth it not all lie heavy on thee , as it doth upon me ? "
57969	57992	57966	57966	She	543	" And where is the city now ? is not this the wilderness again , and thou and I alone together therein ? "
58028	58052	58019	58019	He	85	" Is it not in one matter better than the wilderness ? is not the fear gone , yea , every whit thereof ? "
58075	58083	58062	58062	she	543	" Even so it is , beloved . "
58112	58131	58085	58085	she	543	" Here is the token ; this is a maid 's girdle , and the woman is ungirt . "
