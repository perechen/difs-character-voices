1050	1059	1039	1039	He	122	" Are n't you very hot , Nollie ? "
1081	1097	1077	1077	Eve	130	" It 's a bet , Uncle . They 've got to dance me down . "
1102	1109	1098	1098	Pierson	122	" A bet ? My dears ! "
1116	1124	1110	1110	Noel	197	" It 's all right , Daddy ! "
1131	1147	1126	1128	the young man	366	" She 's bet us one of her puppies against one of mine , sir ! "
1460	1467	1457	1457	she	360	" I 'm going to stop ! "
1489	1495	1483	1483	Eve	130	" Hurrah I 've won ! "
1501	1513	1496	1498	The young man	366	" I say , Noel , we were n't half done ! "
1514	1535	1496	1498	The young man	366	" I know ; but Daddy was getting bored , were n't you , dear ? This is Cyril Morland . "
1544	1552	1496	1498	The young man	366	" Daddy , your nose is burnt ! "
1553	1560	1496	1498	The young man	366	" My dear ; I know . "
1561	1589	1496	1498	The young man	366	" I can give you some white stuff for it . You have to sleep with it on all night . Uncle and Auntie both use it . "
1590	1593	1496	1498	The young man	366	" Nollie ! "
1594	1616	1496	1498	The young man	366	" Well , Eve says so . If you 're going to bathe , Cyril , look out for that current ! "
1630	1633	1617	1619	The young man	366	" Rather ! "
1650	1670	1645	1645	Eve	130	" If you 're going to have a bath before tea , Nollie , you 'd better hurry up . "
1671	1684	1617	1619	The young man	366	" All right . Was it jolly in the Abbey , Daddy ? "
1685	1695	1645	1645	Eve	130	" Lovely ; like a great piece of music . "
1696	1726	1617	1619	The young man	366	" Daddy always puts everything into music . You ought to see it by moonlight ; it 's gorgeous then . All right , Eve ; I 'm coming . "
1750	1757	1645	1645	Eve	130	" What d'you think of Cyril ? "
1758	1776	1617	1619	The young man	366	" My dear , how can I tell ? He seems a nice - looking young man . "
1777	1798	1799	1799	She	366	" All right , Daddy ; do n't strain yourself . It 's jolly down here , is n't it ? "
2363	2373	2374	2413	The woman standing behind him , in a lilac - coloured gown , had one of those faces which remain innocent to the end of the chapter , in spite of the complete knowledge of life which appertains to mothers	398	" Are n't you coming to tea , Edward ? "
2580	2582	2574	2574	She	137	" Goodness "
2649	2659	2625	2625	He	125	" How d'you think Noel is looking , Edward ? "
2660	2670	2625	2625	He	125	" Very pretty . That young man , Thirza ? "
2671	2688	2625	2625	He	125	" Yes ; I 'm afraid he 's over head and ears in love with her . "
2705	2717	2696	2696	she	137	" He 's going to the front soon , poor boy ! "
2718	2725	2625	2625	He	125	" Have they talked to you ? "
2726	2735	2696	2696	she	137	" He has . Nollie has n't yet . "
2736	2745	2625	2625	He	125	" Nollie is a queer child , Thirza . "
2746	2760	2696	2696	she	137	" Nollie is a darling , but rather a desperate character , Edward . "
2781	2785	2625	2625	He	125	" rather desperate character "
2789	2796	2797	2797	he	122	" What a picture she is ! "
2827	2910	2807	2808	his brother	327	" You incorrigible dreamy chap , Ted ! We 've eaten all the raspberries . Eve , give him some jam ; he must be dead ! Phew ! the heat ! Come on , my dear , and pour out his tea . Hallo , Cyril ! Had a good bathe ? By George , wish my head was wet ! Squattez - vous down over there , by Nollie ; she 'll swing , and keep the flies off you . "
2911	2920	2955	2955	Noel	197	" Give me a cigarette , Uncle Bob - "
2921	2929	2807	2808	his brother	327	" What ! Your father does n't - "
2930	2943	2955	2955	Noel	197	" Just for the flies . You do n't mind , Daddy ? "
2944	2954	2807	2808	his brother	327	" Not if it 's necessary , my dear . "
2974	2985	2964	2964	her	412	" It is n't necessary , but it 's nice . "
2986	2991	2993	2994	Bob Pierson	125	" Ah , ha ! "
2996	3003	2993	2994	Bob Pierson	125	" Here you are , Nollie ! "
3312	3338	3303	3303	he	122	" I give Thee thanks for my senses , O Lord . In all of us , keep them bright , and grateful for beauty . "
3389	3407	3427	3427	his	140	" Love of beauty is really only the sex instinct , which nothing but complete union satisfies . "
3635	3643	3630	3630	Noel	197	" Can I come in , Daddy ? "
3678	3715	3667	3667	she	437	" Here 's a letter from Gratian ; George has been sent home ill , and he 's gone to our house . She 's got leave from her hospital to come home and nurse him . "
3721	3725	3716	3716	Pierson	122	" Poor George ! "
3726	3740	3667	3667	she	437	" When are you going to let me be a nurse , Daddy ? "
3741	3752	3716	3716	Pierson	122	" We must wait till you 're eighteen , Nollie . "
3753	3773	3667	3667	she	437	" I could easily say I was . It 's only a month ; and I look much more . "
3777	3782	3716	3716	Pierson	122	" Do n't I ? "
3783	3803	3716	3716	Pierson	122	" You might be anything from fifteen to twenty - five , my dear , according as you behave . "
3804	3817	3716	3716	Pierson	122	" I want to go out as near the front as possible . "
3910	3921	3904	3904	her	439	" This is new , is n't it , Nollie ? "
3922	3941	3972	3972	She	439	" Cyril Morland 's sisters are both out ; and he 'll be going soon . Everybody goes . "
3942	3959	3904	3904	her	439	" Gratian has n't got out yet : It takes a long time to get trained . "
3960	3971	3972	3972	She	439	" I know ; all the more reason to begin . "
4012	4061	4009	4009	she	439	" Are you going to church ? It 's worth anything to hear Uncle Bob read the Lessons , especially when he loses his place . No ; you 're not to put on your long coat till just before church time . I wo n't have it ! "
4069	4086	4087	4087	She	439	" Now , you see , you can have my rose . Your nose is better ! "
4104	4112	4094	4094	her	439	" That 's all . Come along ! "
4423	4435	4416	4418	a surpliced figure	453	" I come not to bring Peace , but a sword . "
4596	4604	4606	4607	the preacher	457	" Let us not , dear brethren , "
4612	4721	4606	4607	the preacher	457	" think that our dear Lord , in saying that He brought a sword , referred to a physical sword . It was the sword of the spirit to which He was undoubtedly referring , that bright sword of the spirit which in all ages has cleaved its way through the fetters imposed on men themselves by their own desires , imposed by men on other men in gratification of their ambitions , as we have had so striking an example in the invasion by our cruel enemies of a little neighbouring country which had done them no harm . Dear brethren , we may all bring swords . "
4759	4816	4745	4745	he	125	" But let us be sure that our swords are bright ; bright with hope , and bright with faith , that we may see them flashing among the carnal desires of this mortal life , carving a path for us towards that heavenly kingdom where alone is peace , perfect peace . Let us pray . "
5405	5415	5393	5393	she	473	" Oh ! Noel , what have I done ? "
5836	5867	5833	5833	Noel	197	" I must tell Daddy , Cyril . I meant to tell him something this morning , only I thought I 'd better wait , in case you did n't . "
5871	5876	5868	5868	Morland	133	" Oh , Noel ! "
5899	5916	5896	5896	Morland	133	" I shall go off my chump if we 're not married before I go out . "
5917	5924	5979	5979	she	496	" How long does it take ? "
5925	5958	5896	5896	Morland	133	" No time , if we hurry up . I 've got six days before I rejoin , and perhaps the Chief will give me another week , if I tell him . "
5959	5971	5979	5979	she	496	" Poor Daddy ! Kiss me again ; a long one . "
5982	6000	5979	5979	she	496	" Then I can come and be near you till you go out ? Oh , Cyril ! "
6001	6006	5979	5979	she	496	" Oh , Noel ! "
6007	6025	5979	5979	she	496	" Perhaps you wo n't go so soon . Do n't go if you can help it ! "
6026	6043	5979	5979	she	496	" Not if I can help it , darling ; but I sha n't be able . "
6044	6054	5979	5979	she	496	" No , of course not ; I know . "
6061	6104	6055	6056	Young Morland	147	" Everyone 's in the same boat , but it ca n't last for ever ; and now we 're engaged we can be together all the time till I 've got the licence or whatever it is . And then - ! "
6105	6124	6140	6141	young Morland	133	" Daddy wo n't like our not being married in a church ; but I do n't care ! "
6163	6175	6159	6159	she	497	" We must go , Cyril . Kiss me once more ! "
6279	6294	6295	6295	She	497	" Do n't light up , Daddy ; I 've got something to say . "
6312	6327	6295	6295	She	497	" I 'm engaged to Cyril ; we want to be married this week . "
6351	6367	6347	6347	she	497	" You see , we must be ; he may be going out any day . "
6390	6417	6387	6387	he	122	" My dear , you 're only a child . Marriage is the most serious thing in life ; you 've only known him three weeks . "
6418	6425	6426	6426	her	497	" I know all that , Daddy "
6433	6459	6426	6426	her	497	" but we ca n't afford to wait . He might never come back , you see , and then I should have missed him . "
6460	6481	6426	6426	her	497	" But , Noel , suppose he never did come back ; it would only be much worse for you . "
6508	6530	6503	6503	her	497	" No ; much better , Daddy ; you think I do n't know my own feelings , but I do . "
6542	6578	6503	6503	her	497	" Nollie , true marriage is the union of souls ; and for that , time is wanted . Time to know that you feel and think the same , and love the same things . "
6579	6589	6503	6503	her	497	" Yes , I know ; but we do . "
6590	6607	6503	6503	her	497	" You ca n't tell that , my dear ; no one could in three weeks . "
6608	6648	6503	6503	her	497	" But these are n't ordinary times , are they ? People have to do things in a hurry . Oh , Daddy ! Be an angel ! Mother would have understood , and let me , I know ! "
6674	6679	6680	6680	he	122	" Look , Nollie ! "
6683	6806	6680	6680	he	122	" After all these years since she left us , I 'm as lonely as ever , because we were really one . If you marry this young man without knowing more of your own hearts than you can in such a little time , you may regret it dreadfully ; you may find it turn out , after all , nothing but a little empty passion ; or again , if anything happens to him before you 've had any real married life together , you 'll have a much greater grief and sense of loss to put up with than if you simply stay engaged till after the war . Besides , my child , you 're much too young . "
6819	6824	6812	6812	he	122	" But I must ! "
6834	6841	6825	6825	He	122	" You ca n't , Nollie ! "
6986	7023	6982	6982	he	122	" Nollie dear , I did n't mean to be harsh . If I were your mother , I should know how to make you see , but I 'm only an old bumble - daddy . "
7071	7091	7063	7063	He	122	" You must let me talk it over with your aunt . She has a lot of good sense . "
7092	7095	7063	7063	He	122	" Yes . "
7105	7119	7096	7096	He	122	" Good night , my dear ; do n't cry . Promise me ! "
7231	7238	7228	7228	his	122	" Do n't cry , Nollie ! "
7451	7477	7448	7448	he	150	" I 'm very troubled , Thirza . Nollie came to me last night . Imagine ! They want to get married - those two ! "
7516	7522	7504	7504	She	137	" Oh , my dear ! "
7523	7558	7504	7504	She	137	" Think of it , Thirza - that child ! Why , it 's only a year or two since she used to sit on my knee and tickle my face with her hair . "
7566	7600	7559	7559	Thirza	137	" Noel is older than you think , Edward ; she is more than her age . And real married life would n't begin for them till after - if it ever began . "
7622	7627	7628	7628	he	122	" But - but - "
7631	7649	7628	7628	he	122	" the union , Thirza ! Who can tell what will happen before they come together again ! "
7661	7699	7650	7650	She	516	" I know , Edward ; but if you refuse , I should be afraid , in these days , of what Noel might do . I told you there 's a streak of desperation in her . "
7700	7706	7650	7650	She	516	" Noel will obey me . "
7707	7721	7650	7650	She	516	" I wonder ! There are so many of these war marriages now . "
7726	7753	7650	7650	She	516	" I think they 're dreadful . What do they mean - Just a momentary gratification of passion . They might just as well not be . "
7754	7763	7765	7765	Thirza	137	" They mean pensions , as a rule , "
7768	7956	7650	7650	She	516	" Thirza , that is cynical ; besides , it does n't affect this case . I ca n't bear to think of my little Nollie giving herself for a moment which may come to nothing , or may turn out the beginning of an unhappy marriage . Who is this boy - what is he ? I know nothing of him . How can I give her to him - it 's impossible ! If they had been engaged some time and I knew something of him - yes , perhaps ; even at her age . But this hasty passionateness - it is n't right , it is n't decent . I do n't understand , I really do n't - how a child like that can want it . The fact is , she does n't know what she 's asking , poor little Nollie . She ca n't know the nature of marriage , and she ca n't realise its sacredness . If only her mother were here ! Talk to her , Thirza ; you can say things that I ca n't ! "
8047	8067	8041	8042	The girl	525	" It is n't any use talking to me , Auntie ; Cyril is going to get a license . "
8068	8079	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Oh ! So you 've made up your minds ? "
8080	8083	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Quite . "
8084	8112	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Do you think that 's fair by me , Nollie ? Should I have asked him here if I 'd thought this was going to happen ? "
8117	8127	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Have you the least idea what marriage means ? "
8131	8134	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Really ? "
8135	8148	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Of course . Gratian is married . Besides , at school - "
8149	8192	8041	8042	The girl	525	" Your father is dead against it . This is a sad thing for him . He 's a perfect saint , and you ought n't to hurt him . Ca n't you wait , at least till Cyril 's next leave ? "
8193	8203	8041	8042	The girl	525	" He might never have one , you see . "
8281	8317	8273	8273	she	526	" Daddy ought n't to mind . Old people have n't to fight , and get killed ; they ought n't to mind us taking what we can . They 've had their good time . "
8329	8340	8326	8326	Thirza	137	" Yes ; perhaps he has n't quite realised that . "
8341	8388	8389	8389	Thirza	137	" I want to make sure of Cyril , Auntie ; I want everything I can have with him while there 's the chance . I do n't think it 's much to ask , when perhaps I 'll never have any more of him again . "
8399	8403	8404	8404	she	137	" I understand , "
8407	8437	8404	8404	she	137	" Only , Nollie , suppose , when all this is over , and we breathe and live naturally once more , you found you 'd made a mistake ? "
8443	8448	8438	8438	Noel	197	" I have n't . "
8449	8508	8391	8391	her	137	" We all think that , my dear ; but thousands of mistakes are made by people who no more dream they 're making them than you do now ; and then it 's a very horrible business . It would be especially horrible for you ; your father believes heart and soul in marriage being for ever . "
8509	8545	8438	8438	Noel	197	" Daddy 's a darling ; but I do n't always believe what he believes , you know . Besides , I 'm not making a mistake , Auntie ! I love Cyril ever so . "
8553	8576	8546	8546	Thirza	137	" You must n't make a mistake . We love you too much , Nollie . I wish we had Gratian here . "
8577	8584	8586	8586	Noel	197	" Gratian would back me up , "
8685	8685	8681	8681	he	133	"
8686	8706	8707	8707	Noel	197	" My dear , I think he remembers only too well . He was desperately attached to your mother . "
8712	8782	8707	8707	Noel	197	" Was he ? Well , so am I to Cyril , and he to me . We would n't be unreasonable if it was n't - was n't necessary . Talk , to Cyril , Auntie ; then you 'll understand . There he is ; only , do n't keep him long , because I want him . Oh ! Auntie ; I want him so badly ! "
8824	8835	8810	8810	his	3085	" Well , Cyril , so you 've betrayed me ! "
8904	8911	8912	8912	he	3085	" You see , Mrs. Pierson , "
8915	9035	9036	9036	He	3085	" it 's not as if Noel were an ordinary girl in an ordinary time , is it ? Noel is the sort of girl one would knock one 's brains out for ; and to send me out there knowing that I could have been married to her and was n't , will take all the heart out of me . Of course I mean to come back , but chaps do get knocked over , and I think it 's cruel that we ca n't take what we can while we can . Besides , I 've got money ; and that would be hers anyway . So , do be a darling , wo n't you ? "
9070	9185	9038	9038	his	3085	" You see , I do n't know Mr. Pierson , but he seems awfully gentle and jolly , and if he could see into me he would n't mind , I know . We do n't mind risking our lives and all that , but we do think we ought to have the run of them while we 're alive . I 'll give him my dying oath or anything , that I could never change towards Noel , and she 'll do the same . Oh ! Mrs. Pierson , do be a jolly brick , and put in a word for me , quick ! We 've got so few days ! "
9186	9193	9195	9195	Thirza	137	" But , my dear boy , "
9198	9212	9195	9195	Thirza	137	" do you think it 's fair to such a child as Noel ? "
9213	9345	9038	9038	his	3085	" Yes , I do . You do n't understand ; she 's simply had to grow up . She is grown - up - all in this week ; she 's quite as old as I am , really - and I 'm twenty - two . And you know it 's going to be - it 's got to be - a young world , from now on ; people will begin doing things much earlier . What 's the use of pretending it 's like what it was , and being cautious , and all that ? If I 'm going to be killed , I think we 've got a right to be married first ; and if I 'm not , then what does it matter ? "
9346	9359	9444	9445	Cyril Morland	133	" You 've known each other twenty - one days , Cyril . "
9360	9399	9038	9038	his	3085	" No ; twenty - one years ! Every day 's a year when - Oh ! Mrs. Pierson , this is n't like you , is it ? You never go to meet trouble , do you ? "
9423	9429	9430	9430	she	137	" Well , my dear , "
9434	9443	9430	9430	she	137	" we must see what can be done . "
9450	9458	9459	9459	he	133	" I will bless you for ever , "
9462	9478	9459	9459	he	133	" I have n't got any people , you know , except my two sisters . "
9542	9565	9526	9527	Gratian Laird	127	" Reverend Edward Pierson , Kestrel , Tintern , Monmouthshire . George terribly ill . Please come if you can . Gratian . "

10379	10382	10376	10376	he	122	" DEAREST CHILD ,
10383	10437	10376	10376	he	122	" I am going up to Gratian ; poor George is desperately ill . If it goes badly you should be with your sister . I will wire to - morrow morning early . I leave you in your aunt 's hands , my dear . Be reasonable and patient . God bless you .
10438	10440	10376	10376	he	122	" Your devoted
10441	10444	10376	10376	he	122	" DADDY . "
10595	10600	10642	10643	The soldier	583	" Never - never ! "
10738	10751	10731	10731	she	586	" Sit dahn ; do n't ' ang out o ' there . "
10765	10780	10781	10781	he	583	" The wife an ' me 's ' ad a bit of a row , "
10785	10857	10781	10781	he	583	" Gits on me nerves ; I 'm not used to it . She was in a raid , and ' er nerves are all gone funny ; ai n't they , old girl ? Makes me feel me ' ead . I 've been wounded there , you know ; ca n't stand much now . I might do somethin' if she was to go on like this for long . "
10881	10885	10886	10886	he	583	" Take one , "
10905	10944	10896	10897	the soldier	583	" We all have these troubles with those we 're fond of ; the fonder we are of people , the more we feel them , do n't we ? I had one with my daughter last night . "
10945	10948	10950	10951	the soldier	583	" Ah ! "
10953	10976	10950	10951	the soldier	583	" that 's right . The wife and me'll make it up . ' Ere , come orf it , old girl . "
11084	11125	11077	11077	Gratian	127	" Just the same . The doctor says we shall know in a few hours now . How sweet of you to come ! You must be tired , in this heat . It was dreadful to spoil your holiday . "
11126	11141	11077	11077	Gratian	127	" My dear ! As if - May I go up and see him ? "
11270	11277	11278	11278	she	356	" If he dies , Dad - "
11281	11301	11254	11254	he	122	" He will have died for the Country , my love , as much as ever our soldiers do . "
11302	11344	11254	11254	he	122	" I know ; but that 's no comfort . I 've been watching here all day ; I 've been thinking ; men will be just as brutal afterwards - more brutal . The world will go on the same . "
11345	11357	11254	11254	he	122	" We must hope not . Shall we pray , Gracie ? "
11363	11406	11254	11254	he	122	" If I could believe that the world - if I could believe anything ! I 've lost the power , Dad ; I do n't even believe in a future life . If George dies , we shall never meet again . "
11419	11452	11415	11415	Gratian	127	" The last time we talked , I was angry with George because he laughed at my belief ; now that I really want belief , I feel that he was right . "
11457	11483	11453	11453	Pierson	122	" No , no , my dear ; it 's only that you 're overwrought . God in His mercy will give you back belief . "
11484	11491	11415	11415	Gratian	127	" There is no God , Dad "
11492	11502	11453	11453	Pierson	122	" My darling child , what are you saying ? "
11503	11553	11415	11415	Gratian	127	" No God who can help us ; I feel it . If there were any God who could take part in our lives , alter anything without our will , knew or cared what we did - He would n't let the world go on as it does . "
11554	11588	11453	11453	Pierson	122	" But , my dear , His purposes are inscrutable . We dare not say He should not do this or that , or try to fathom to what ends He is working . "
11589	11695	11415	11415	Gratian	127	" Then He 's no good to us . It 's the same as if He did n't exist . Why should I pray for George 's life to One whose ends are just His own ? I know George ought n't to die . If there 's a God who can help , it will be a wicked shame if George dies ; if there 's a God who can help , it 's a wicked shame when babies die , and all these millions of poor boys . I would rather think there 's no God than a helpless or a wicked God - "
11719	11735	11696	11696	Her	612	" Dad dear , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to hurt you . "
11752	11787	11736	11736	Pierson	122	" What do you think would have happened to me , Gracie , if I had lost belief when your mother died ? I have never lost belief . Pray God I never shall ! "
11791	11836	11788	11788	Gratian	127	" George would not wish me to pretend I believe - he would want me to be honest . If I 'm not honest , I sha n't deserve that he should live . I do n't believe , and I ca n't pray . "
11837	11845	11788	11788	Gratian	127	" My darling , you 're overtired . "
11846	11851	11852	11852	She	614	" No , Dad . "
11873	11890	11854	11854	her	614	" We can only help ourselves ; and I can only bear it if I rebel . "
11940	11974	11930	11930	She	127	" Go and rest , Dad ; the doctor 's coming again at eleven . I 'll call you if I want anything . I shall lie down a little , beside him . "
12206	12217	12201	12201	his	140	" I 've been hanging over the edge , Gracie ! "
12773	12826	12768	12768	he	140	" If we 're not to trust our reason and our senses for what they 're worth , sir - will you kindly tell me what we are to trust ? How can we exert them to the utmost in some matters , and in others suddenly turn our backs on them ? "
12848	12852	12853	12853	he	140	" I grant , "
12857	13105	12853	12853	he	140	" that there 's a great ultimate Mystery , that we shall never know anything for certain about the origin of life and the principle of the Universe ; but why should we suddenly shut up our enquiring apparatus and deny all the evidence of our reason - say , about the story of Christ , or the question of a future life , or our moral code ? If you want me to enter a temple of little mysteries , leaving my reason and senses behind - as a Mohammedan leaves his shoes - it wo n't do to say to me simply : ' There it is ! Enter ! ' You must show me the door ; and you ca n't ! And I 'll tell you why , sir . Because in your brain there 's a little twist which is not in mine , or the lack of a little twist which is in mine . Nothing more than that divides us into the two main species of mankind , one of whom worships , and one of whom does n't . Oh , yes ! I know ; you wo n't admit that , because it makes your religions natural instead of what you call supernatural . But I assure you there 's nothing more to it . Your eyes look up or they look down - they never look straight before them . Well , mine do just the opposite . "
13169	13189	13165	13165	he	122	" I am able now to answer your questions , George . I think I can make you understand . "
13194	13203	13190	13190	Laird	140	" All right , sir ; go ahead . "
13204	13257	13265	13265	his	122	" You begin by assuming that the human reason is the final test of all things . What right have you to assume that ? Suppose you were an ant . You would take your ant 's reason as the final test , would n't you ? Would that be the truth ? "
13279	13288	13289	13289	he	140	" That seems a good point , sir , "
13292	13338	13289	13289	he	140	" until you recognise that I do n't take , the human reason as final test in any absolute sense . I only say it 's the highest test we can apply ; and that , behind that test all is quite dark and unknowable . "
13339	13349	13273	13274	George Laird	140	" Revelation , then , means nothing to you ? "
13350	13355	13289	13289	he	140	" Nothing , sir . "
13356	13369	13273	13274	George Laird	140	" I do n't think we can usefully go on , George . "
13370	13400	13289	13289	he	140	" I do n't think we can , sir . In talking with you , I always feel like fighting a man with one hand tied behind his back . "
13401	13420	13273	13274	George Laird	140	" And I , perhaps , feel that I am arguing with one who was blind from birth . "
13544	13554	13528	13528	he	140	" I 've got something to tell your father . "
13568	13575	13528	13528	he	140	" Tell me first , George . "
13576	13606	13627	13627	He	140	" Our last talk , Gracie ; well - there 's nothing - on the other side . I looked over ; it 's as black as your hat . "
13610	13626	13627	13627	He	140	" I know . While you were lying here last night , I told father . "
13635	13643	13627	13627	He	140	" I also want to tell him . "
13644	13655	13627	13627	He	140	" Dad will say the motive for life is gone . "
13656	13735	13627	13627	He	140	" I say it leaps out all the more , Gracie . What a mess we make of it - we angel - apes ! When shall we be men , I wonder ? You and I , Gracie , will fight for a decent life for everybody . No hands - upping about that ! Bend down ! It 's good to touch you again ; everything 's good . I 'm going to have a sleep .... "
13805	13817	13800	13800	he	122	" George out of danger but very weak . Come up . "
13832	13948	13830	13830	Thirza	137	" I have had two long talks with Noel and Cyril . It is impossible to budge them . And I really think , dear Edward , that it will be a mistake to oppose it rigidly . He may not go out as soon as we think . How would it be to consent to their having banns published ? - that would mean another three weeks anyway , and in absence from each other they might be influenced to put it off . I 'm afraid this is the only chance , for if you simply forbid it , I feel they will run off and get married somewhere at a registrar 's . "
14231	14241	14224	14224	his	133	" Rejoin tonight . Regiment leaves to - morrow . "
14290	14299	14224	14224	his	133	" How long have we got , Cyril ? "
14300	14328	14224	14224	his	133	" I 've engaged a car from the Inn , so I need n't leave till midnight . I 've packed already , to have more time . "
14329	14351	14224	14224	his	133	" Let 's have it to ourselves , then . Let 's go off somewhere . I 've got some chocolate . "
14356	14404	14352	14352	Morland	133	" I can send the car up here for my things , and have it pick me up at the Inn , if you 'll say goodbye to them for me , afterwards . We 'll walk down the line , then we sha n't meet anyone . "
14430	14437	14439	14439	Noel	197	" Let 's get a boat , "
14441	14466	14439	14439	Noel	197	" We can come back here when it 's moonlight . I know a way of getting in , after the gate 's shut . "
14690	14710	14687	14687	Noel	197	" When she 's over those trees , Cyril , let 's go . It 'll be half dark . "
14734	14737	14739	14739	Noel	197	" Now ! "
14777	14784	14785	14785	she	675	" We can get over here , "
14819	14825	14827	14827	Noel	197	" What 's the time ? "
14829	14835	14827	14827	Noel	197	" Half - past ten . "
14836	14853	14827	14827	Noel	197	" Already ! Let 's sit here in the dark , and watch for the moon . "
14955	14958	14947	14947	Noel	197	" See ! "
15027	15030	15031	15031	Noel	197	" Ours ! "
15287	15305	15260	15260	She	675	" Cyril asked me to say good - bye to you all , Uncle . Good night ! "
15306	15317	15323	15323	She	675	" But , I say , Nollie look here you ! "
15351	15361	15347	15347	She	675	" No , Auntie . Not to - night ! "
15408	15431	15405	15405	his	125	" Phew ! I was beginning to think we should w have to drag the river . What girls are coming to ! "
15432	15440	15471	15471	Thirza	137	" It 's the war , Bob . "
15441	15468	15405	15405	his	125	" I did n't like her face , old girl . I do n't know what it was , but I did n't like her face . "
15505	15520	15501	15501	She	137	" Poor young things ! I suppose it will be a relief to Edward ! "
15521	15526	15528	15529	Bob Pierson	125	" I love Nollie ! "
15532	15635	15528	15529	Bob Pierson	125	" She 's an affectionate creature . D - nit , I 'm sorry about this . It 's not so bad for young Morland ; he 's got the excitement - though I should n't like to be leaving Nollie , if I were young again . Thank God , neither of our boys is engaged . By George ! when I think of them out there , and myself here , I feel as if the top of my head would come off . And those politician chaps spouting away in every country - how they can have the cheek ! "
15642	15647	15648	15648	he	700	" And no dinner ! "
15652	15663	15648	15648	he	700	" What d'you think they 've been doing with themselves ? "
15664	15687	15528	15529	Bob Pierson	125	" Holding each other 's hands , poor dears ! D'you know what time it is , Bob ? Nearly one o'clock . "
15688	15718	15648	15648	he	700	" Well , all I can say is , I 've had a wretched evening . Get to bed , old girl . You 'll be fit for nothing . "
15789	15793	15781	15781	She	137	" MY DARLING LOVE ,
15794	15863	15781	15781	She	137	" I got back all right , and am posting this at once to tell you we shall pass through London , and go from Charing Cross , I expect about nine o'clock to - night . I shall look out for you , there , in case you are up in time . Every minute I think of you , and of last night . Oh ! Noel !
15864	15868	15781	15781	She	137	" Your devoted lover ,
15869	15871	15781	15781	She	137	" C. "
15906	15949	15899	15900	her father	384	" Take my things up , Dinah . I 've got a headache from travelling ; I 'm going to walk it off . Perhaps I sha n't be in till past nine or so . Give my love to them all . "
15950	15961	15897	15897	Gratian	127	" Oh , Miss Noel , you ca n't , - "
16125	16127	16119	16120	the crowd	713	" khaki "
16194	16201	16186	16186	He	716	" Come with me , miss . "
16237	16244	16205	16205	He	716	" Brother goin' out , miss ? "
16248	16473	16483	16483	he	719	" Ah ! It 's a crool war . I sha n't be sorry when it 's over . Goin' out and comin ' in , we see some sad sights ' ere . Wonderful spirit they 've got , too . I never look at the clock now but what I think : ' There you go , slow - coach ! I 'd like to set you on to the day the boys come back ! ' When I puts a bag in : ' Another for ' ell ' I thinks . And so it is , miss , from all I can ' ear . I 've got a son out there meself . It 's ' ere they 'll come along . You stand quiet and keep a lookout , and you 'll get a few minutes with him when he 's done with ' is men . I would n't move , if I were you ; he 'll come to you , all right - ca n't miss you , there . ' And , looking at her face , he thought : ' Astonishin ' what a lot o ' brothers go . Wot oh ! Poor little missy ! A little lady , too . Wonderful collected she is . It 's ' ard ! ' "
16487	16513	16483	16483	he	719	" You could n't be in a better place for seen'im off . Good night , miss ; anything else I can do for you ? "
16514	16525	16526	16526	He	719	" No , thank you ; you 're very kind . "
17140	17180	17127	17127	her	720	" Write to me as much as ever you can , Cyril . I 'm going to be a nurse at once . And the first leave you get , I shall come to you - do n't forget . "
17181	17201	17202	17202	She	720	" Forget ! Move a little back , darling ; they ca n't see us here . Kiss me ! "
17254	17266	17251	17251	He	197	" Was it all right when you got in last night ? "
17267	17278	17251	17251	He	197	" Yes ; I said good - bye for you . "
17279	17297	17251	17251	He	197	" Oh ! Noel - I 've been afraid - I ought n't - I ought n't - "
17298	17311	17251	17251	He	197	" Yes , yes ; nothing can take you from me now . "
17312	17321	17251	17251	He	197	" You have got pluck . More than ! "
17332	17357	17326	17326	Morland	133	" Good - bye , my little wife ! Do n't fret . Goodbye ! I must go . God bless you , Noel ! "
17358	17363	17326	17326	Morland	133	" I love you . "
17446	17451	17438	17441	someone leaning far out	750	" If auld acquaintance - "
18056	18073	18048	18048	she	720	" Which is the way towards Bloomsbury , please ? I ca n't find a taxi . "
18092	18102	18089	18089	he	587	" They 're linin ' up for the theatres , "
18117	18137	18089	18089	he	587	" I 'm goin' that way , miss . If you like , you can step along with me . "
18142	18153	18154	18155	the policeman	775	" The streets are n't what they ought to be , "
18158	18192	18154	18155	the policeman	775	" What with the darkness , and the war turning the girls heads - you 'd be surprised the number of them that comes out . It 's the soldiers , of course . "
18199	18209	18210	18211	the policeman	775	" I daresay you would n't have noticed it , "
18215	18279	18210	18211	the policeman	775	" but this war 's a funny thing . The streets are gayer and more crowded at night than I 've ever seen them ; it 's a fair picnic all the time . What we 're goin' to settle down to when peace comes , I do n't know . I suppose you find it quiet enough up your way , miss ? "
18280	18283	18285	18285	Noel	197	" Yes , "
18287	18291	18285	18285	Noel	197	" quite quiet . "
18292	18308	18210	18211	the policeman	775	" No soldiers up in Bloomsbury . You got anyone in the Army , miss ? "
18312	18395	18399	18399	him	777	" Ah ! It 's anxious times for ladies . What with the Zeps , and their brothers and all in France , it 's ' arassin ' . I 've lost a brother meself , and I 've got a boy out there in the Garden of Eden ; his mother carries on dreadful about him . What we shall think of it when it 's all over , I ca n't tell . These Huns are a wicked tough lot ! "
18424	18433	18434	18434	she	780	" I 'm sorry you 've lost someone , "
18437	18448	18434	18434	she	780	" I have n't lost anyone very near , yet . "
18449	18791	18815	18816	the policeman	775	" Well , let 's ' ope you wo n't , miss . These times make you feel for others , an ' that 's something . I 've noticed a great change in folks you 'd never think would feel for anyone . And yet I 've seen some wicked things too ; we do , in the police . Some of these English wives of aliens , and ' armless little German bakers , an ' Austrians , and what - not : they get a crool time . It 's their misfortune , not their fault , that 's what I think ; and the way they get served - well , it makes you ashamed o ' bein ' English sometimes - it does straight : And the women are the worst . I said to my wife only last night , I said : ' They call themselves Christians , ' I said , ' but for all the charity that 's in 'em they might as well be Huns . ' She could n't see it - not she ! ' Well , why do they drop bombs ? ' she says . ' What ! ' I said , ' those English wives and bakers drop bombs ? Do n't be silly , ' I said . ' They 're as innocent as we . ' It 's the innocent that gets punished for the guilty . ' But they 're all spies , ' she says . ' Oh ! ' I said , ' old lady ! Now really ! At your time of life ! ' But there it is ; you ca n't get a woman to see reason . It 's readin ' the papers . I often think they must be written by women - beggin ' your pardon , miss - but reely , the ' ysterics and the ' atred - they 're a fair knockout . D'you find much hatred in your household , miss ? "
18797	18809	18792	18792	Noel	197	" No ; my father 's a clergyman , you see . "
18810	18813	18815	18816	the policeman	775	" Ah ! "
18833	18837	18838	18838	he	775	" Of course , "
18842	19048	18838	18838	he	775	" you 're bound to have a sense of justice against these Huns ; some of their ways of goin' on have been above the limit . But what I always think is - of course I do n't say these things - no use to make yourself unpopular - but to meself I often think : Take 'em man for man , and you 'd find 'em much the same as we are , I daresay . It 's the vicious way they 're brought up , of actin ' in the mass , that 's made 'em such a crool lot . I see a good bit of crowds in my profession , and I 've a very low opinion of them . Crowds are the most blunderin ' blighted things that ever was . They 're like an angry woman with a bandage over her eyes , an ' you ca n't have anything more dangerous than that . These Germans , it seems , are always in a crowd . They get a state o ' mind read out to them by Bill Kaser and all that bloody - minded lot , an ' they never stop to think for themselves . "
19049	19060	19062	19062	Noel	197	" I suppose they 'd be shot if they did , "
19064	19071	19073	19074	the policeman	775	" Well , there is that , "
19077	19098	19100	19100	he	775	" They 've brought discipline to an ' igh pitch , no doubt . An ' if you ask me , "
19115	19302	19100	19100	he	775	" we 'll be runnin ' 'em a good second ' ere , before long . The things we ' ave to protect now are gettin ' beyond a joke . There 's the City against lights , there 's the streets against darkness , there 's the aliens , there 's the aliens ' shops , there 's the Belgians , there 's the British wives , there 's the soldiers against the women , there 's the women against the soldiers , there 's the Peace Party , there 's ' orses against croolty , there 's a Cabinet Minister every now an ' then ; and now we 've got these Conchies . And , mind you , they have n't raised our pay ; no war wages in the police . So far as I can see , there 's only one good result of the war - the burglaries are off . But there again , you wait a bit and see if we do n't have a prize crop of ' m , or my name 's not ' Arris . "
19303	19312	19314	19314	Noel	197	" You must have an awfully exciting life ! "
19339	19695	19316	19317	The policeman	775	" We 're used to it , you see ; there 's no excitement in what you 're used to . They find that in the trenches , I 'm told . Take our seamen - there 's lots of 'em been blown up over and over again , and there they go and sign on again next day . That 's where the Germans make their mistake ! England in war - time ! I think a lot , you know , on my go ; you ca n't ' elp it - the mind will work - an ' the more I think , the more I see the fightin ' spirit in the people . We do n't make a fuss about it like Bill Kaser . But you watch a little shopman , one o ' those fellows who 's had his house bombed ; you watch the way he looks at the mess - sort of disgusted . You watch his face , and you see he 's got his teeth into it . You watch one of our Tommies on ' is crutches , with the sweat pourin ' off his forehead an ' ' is eyes all strainy , stumpin ' along - that gives you an idea ! I pity these Peace fellows , reely I pity them ; they do n't know what they 're up against . I expect there 's times when you wish you was a man , do n't you , miss ? I 'm sure there 's times when I feel I 'd like to go in the trenches . That 's the worst o ' my job ; you ca n't be a human bein ' - not in the full sense of the word . You must n't let your passions rise , you must n't drink , you must n't talk ; it 's a narrow walk o ' life . Well , here you are , miss ; your Square 's the next turnin ' to the right . Good night and thank you for your conversation . "
19702	19706	19707	19707	she	787	" Good night ! "
19722	19728	19729	19729	he	775	" Good night , miss , "
19733	19756	19729	19729	he	775	" I see you 've got a trouble ; and I 'm sure I hope it 'll turn out for the best . "
19816	19819	19820	19820	he	775	" Nollie ! "
19823	19827	19820	19820	he	775	" Thank God ! "
19836	19845	19820	19820	he	775	" My child , where have you been ? "
19846	19872	19829	19829	his	775	" It 's all right , Daddy . Cyril has just gone to the front . I 've been seeing him off from Charing Cross . "
20337	20364	20331	20331	each	811	" We love you , but you are not in our secrets - and you must not be , for you would try to destroy them . "
20491	20506	20487	20487	she	812	" I ca n't talk of Cyril , Daddy ; I simply ca n't ! "
20689	20694	20695	20695	he	197	" Well , George , "
20698	20712	20695	20695	he	197	" you gave us a dreadful fright ! I thank God 's mercy . "
20731	20741	20726	20726	Laird	140	" So you really think God merciful , sir ? "
20742	20757	20801	20801	he	140	" Do n't let us argue , George ; you 're not strong enough . "
20758	20770	20726	20726	Laird	140	" Oh ! I 'm pining for something to bite on . "
20780	20793	20771	20771	Pierson	125	" God 's mercy is infinite , and you know it is . "
20804	20833	20801	20801	he	140	" God 's mercy is surely the amount of mercy man has succeeded in arriving at . How much that is , this war tells you , sir . "
20837	20844	20845	20845	he	125	" I do n't follow you , "
20849	20876	20845	20845	he	125	" How can you say such things , when you yourself are only just - No ; I refuse to argue , George ; I refuse . "
20899	20908	20909	20909	he	140	" Well , I 'm going to argue , "
20912	20956	20909	20909	he	140	" I 'm simply bursting with it . I challenge you , sir , to show me where there 's any sign of altruistic pity , except in man . Mother love does n't count - mother and child are too much one . "
20969	20991	20877	20877	Laird	140	" My dear George , is not man the highest work of God , and mercy the highest quality in man ? "
20992	21151	20909	20909	he	140	" Not a bit . If geological time be taken as twenty - four hours , man 's existence on earth so far equals just two seconds of it ; after a few more seconds , when man has been frozen off the earth , geological time will stretch for as long again , before the earth bumps into something , and becomes nebula once more . God 's hands have n't been particularly full , sir , have they - two seconds out of twenty - four hours - if man is His pet concern ? And as to mercy being the highest quality in , man , that 's only a modern fashion of talking . Man 's highest quality is the sense of proportion , for that 's what keeps him alive ; and mercy , logically pursued , would kill him off . It 's a sort of a luxury or by - product . "
21152	21177	21234	21234	Laird	140	" George ! You can have no music in your soul ! Science is such a little thing , if you could only see . "
21178	21186	20909	20909	he	140	" Show me a bigger , sir . "
21187	21190	21234	21234	Laird	140	" Faith . "
21191	21195	20909	20909	he	140	" In what ? "
21196	21205	21234	21234	Laird	140	" In what has been revealed to us . "
21206	21218	20909	20909	he	140	" Ah ! There it is again ! By whom - how ?
21219	21228	21234	21234	Laird	140	" By God Himself - through our Lord . "
21244	21247	21248	21248	he	140	" Christ , "
21251	21315	21248	21248	he	140	" if He existed , which some people , as you know , doubt , was a very beautiful character ; there have been others . But to ask us to believe in His supernaturalness or divinity at this time of day is to ask us to walk through the world blindfold . And that 's what you do , do n't you ? "
21373	21430	21369	21369	he	125	" I can not explain . There are things that I ca n't make clear , because you are wilfully blind to all that I believe in . For what do you imagine we are fighting this great war , if it is not to reestablish the belief in love as the guiding principle of life ? "
21436	21453	21431	21431	Laird	140	" We are fighting to redress a balance , which was in danger of being lost . "
21454	21460	21431	21431	Laird	140	" The balance of power ? "
21461	21472	21431	21431	Laird	140	" Heavens ! - no ! The balance of philosophy . "
21476	21493	21473	21473	Pierson	125	" That sounds very clever , George ; but again , I do n't follow you . "
21494	21584	21431	21431	Laird	140	" The balance between the sayings : ' Might is Right , ' and ' Right is Might . ' They 're both half - truth , but the first was beating the other out of the field . All the rest of it is ca nt , you know . And by the way , sir , your Church is solid for punishment of the evildoer . Where 's mercy there ? Either its God is not merciful , or else it does n't believe in its God . "
21585	21595	21473	21473	Pierson	125	" Just punishment does not preclude mercy , George . "
21596	21602	21431	21431	Laird	140	" It does in Nature . "
21603	21617	21473	21473	Pierson	125	" Ah ! Nature , George - always Nature . God transcends Nature . "
21618	21758	21431	21431	Laird	140	" Then why does He give it a free rein ? A man too fond of drink , or women - how much mercy does he get from Nature ? His overindulgence brings its exact equivalent of penalty ; let him pray to God as much as he likes - unless he alters his ways he gets no mercy . If he does alter his ways , he gets no mercy either ; he just gets Nature 's due reward . We English who have neglected brain and education - how much mercy are we getting in this war ? Mercy 's a man - made ornament , disease , or luxury - call it what you will . Except that , I 've nothing to say against it . On the contrary , I am all for it . "
21804	21813	21796	21796	he	125	" This is bad for you , George . "
21872	21883	21894	21894	he	125	" Holy , holy , holy , Merciful and Mighty ! "
21961	22044	21950	21950	She	127	" I know it hurts you , Dad . But we 've got to find out for ourselves , have n't we ? All the time you and George were talking , I felt that you did n't see that it 's I who 've changed . It 's not what he thinks , but what I 've come to think of my own accord . I wish you 'd understand that I 've got a mind of my own , Dad . "
22051	22059	21952	21952	her	127	" Of course you have a mind . "
22065	22112	22062	22062	her	127	" No , you thought my mind was yours ; and now you think it 's George 's . But it 's my own . When you were my age were n't you trying hard to find the truth yourself , and differing from your father ? "
22180	22185	22186	22186	he	125	" Ah , Gracie ! "

22233	22255	22215	22215	God	143	" I do n't want to rest . Some people search all their lives , and die searching . Why should n't I.
22256	22266	22215	22215	God	143	" You will be most unhappy , my child . "
22267	22305	22215	22215	God	143	" If I 'm unhappy , Dad , it 'll be because the world 's unhappy . I do n't believe it ought to be ; I think it only is , because it shuts its eyes . "
22310	22318	22306	22306	Pierson	125	" You think I shut my eyes ? "
22322	22338	22215	22215	God	143	" If I do , it is because there is no other way to happiness . "
22339	22346	22215	22215	God	143	" Are you happy ; Dad ? "
22347	22370	22215	22215	God	143	" As happy as my nature will let me be . I miss your mother . If I lose you and Noel - "

I was Leila Pierson once upon a time , and I often think of you and wonder what you are like now , and what your girls are like . I have been here nearly a year , working for our wounded , and for a year before that was nursing in South Africa . My husband died five years ago out there . Though we have n't met for I dare not think how long , I should awfully like to see you again . Would you care to come some day and look over my hospital ?

28019	28026	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Are you fond of music ? "
28027	28038	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" I like it well enough . Passes the time . "
28039	28050	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" I 'm afraid the time hangs heavy in hospital . "
28051	28110	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Yes ; it hangs a bit ' eavy ; it 's just ' orspital life . I 've been wounded before , you see . It 's better than bein ' out there . I expect I 'll lose the proper use o ' this arm . I do n't worry ; I 'll get my discharge . "
28111	28120	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" You 've got some good nurses here . "
28121	28136	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Yes ; I like Mrs. Lynch ; she 's the lady I like . "
28137	28141	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" My cousin . "
28142	28167	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" I see you come in together . I see everything ' ere . I think a lot , too . Passes the time . "
28168	28175	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Do they let you smoke ? "
28176	28186	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Oh , yes ! They let us smoke . "
28187	28193	27976	27978	The young soldier	1033	" Have one of mine ? "
28203	28212	28194	28196	The young soldier	1033	" Thank you ; I 've got plenty . "
28223	28242	28213	28214	The nurse	1035	" He 's one of our blase ones ; been in before , have n't you , Simson ? "
28283	28287	28288	28289	The nurse	1035	" Sidi Brahim . "
28293	28299	28301	28303	the young soldier	1033	" ' Seedy Abram , ' "
28305	28323	28301	28303	the young soldier	1033	" The Frenchies sing it ; they takes it up one after the other , ye know . "
28324	28327	28329	28329	Pierson	186	" Ah ! "
28331	28336	28329	28329	Pierson	186	" it 's pretty . "
28375	28382	28383	28383	he	366	" I do n't mind France , "
28387	28424	28383	28383	he	366	" I do n't mind the shells and that ; but I ca n't stick the mud . There 's a lot o ' wounded die in the mud ; ca n't get up - smothered . "
28433	28448	28425	28425	His	366	" I was nearly smothered myself . Just managed to keep me nose up . "
28452	28458	28449	28449	Pierson	186	" Thank God you did ! "
28459	28506	28509	28509	his	366	" Yes ; I did n't like that . I told Mrs. Lynch about that one day when I had the fever . She 's a nice lady ; she 's seen a lot of us boys : That mud 's not right , you know . "
28523	28529	28509	28509	his	366	" The boys in brown . "
28550	28564	28539	28539	he	366	" Good - bye ; I hope you 'll soon be quite recovered . "
28588	28594	28595	28595	he	366	" Good day , sir , "
28598	28603	28595	28595	he	366	" and thank you . "
28670	28696	28810	28810	She	186	" Oh ! There you are , Edward ! Would you like to see the other ward , or shall I show you our kitchen ? "
28703	28756	28697	28697	Pierson	122	" You 're doing a noble work , Leila . I wanted to ask you : Could you arrange for Noel to come and get trained here ? She wants to begin at once . The fact is , a boy she is attracted to has just gone out to the Front . "
28757	28760	28762	28762	Leila	186	" Ah ! "
28771	28809	28810	28810	She	186	" Poor child ! We shall be wanting an extra hand next week . I 'll see if she could come now . I 'll speak to our Matron , and let you know to - night . "
28816	28885	28810	28810	She	186	" Dear Edward , I 'm so glad to see you again . You 're the first of our family I 've seen for sixteen years . I wonder if you 'd bring Noel to have supper at my flat to - night - Just nothing to eat , you know ! It 's a tiny place . There 's a Captain Fort coming ; a nice man . "
29541	29545	29547	29547	she	525	" My dear ! "
29551	29561	29547	29547	she	525	" I simply must , Daddy , just one . "
29875	29887	29959	29959	he	1046	" Is it very horrid in the trenches , Captain Fort ? "
29888	29903	29959	29959	he	1046	" Yes , Miss Pierson ; it is very horrid , as a rule . "
29904	29912	29959	29959	he	1046	" Is it dangerous all the time ? "
29913	29917	29959	29959	he	1046	" Pretty well . "
29918	29928	29959	29959	he	1046	" Do officers run more risks than the men ? "
29929	29937	29959	29959	he	1046	" Not unless there 's an attack . "
29938	29945	29959	29959	he	1046	" Are there attacks very often ? "
29998	30006	29989	29989	He	1046	" Have you a brother out there ? "
30012	30016	30007	30007	She	1066	" But someone ? "
30017	30020	30007	30007	She	1066	" Yes . "
30073	30127	30070	30070	he	1046	" After all , look at me ! I was out there a year , and here I am with only half a game leg ; times were a lot worse , then , too . I often wish I were back there . Anything 's better than London and the War Office . "
30142	30168	30131	30131	he	1046	" Good night , Miss Pierson . Do n't worry . That does no good , and there is n't half the risk you think . "
30184	30188	30189	30189	she	1066	" Good night , "
30192	30197	30189	30189	she	1066	" thank you awfully . "
30469	30473	30514	30514	he	384	" Pride and Prejudice "
30491	30512	30484	30485	her father	384	" Captain Fort , Nollie . Will you give him some coffee ? I 'm afraid I must go out . "
30552	30563	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" What were you thinking about when we came in ? "
30564	30569	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" Only the war . "
30570	30576	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" Any news of him ? "
30587	30604	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" Yes ! he 's gone to the Front . Wo n't you have a cigarette ? "
30605	30611	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" Thanks . Will you ? "
30612	30633	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" I want one awfully . I think sitting still and waiting is more dreadful than anything in the world . "
30634	30682	30546	30547	The visitor	1112	" Except , knowing that others are waiting . When I was out there I used to worry horribly over my mother . She was ill at the time . The cruelest thing in war is the anxiety of people about each other - nothing touches that . "
30711	30719	30720	30720	she	1114	" I wish I were a man , "
30723	30741	30745	30745	she	1114	" I think women have much the worst time in the war . Is your mother old ? "
30754	30760	30752	30752	himself	197	" She died last Christmas . "
30761	30769	30693	30693	He	197	" Oh ! I 'm so sorry ! "
30770	30785	30752	30752	himself	197	" You lost your mother when you were a babe , did n't you ? "
30786	30794	30693	30693	He	197	" Yes . That 's her portrait . "
30855	30874	30849	30849	Fort	197	" It 's not a bit like you . But she must have been a very sweet woman . "
30875	30893	30894	30894	Fort	197	" It 's a sort of presence in the room . I wish I were like her ! "
30897	30900	30901	30901	he	197	" No , "
30904	30921	30901	30901	he	197	" no . Better as you are . It would only have spoiled a complete thing . "
30922	30927	30849	30849	Fort	197	" She was good . "
30928	30934	30901	30901	he	197	" And are n't you ? "
30935	30945	30849	30849	Fort	197	" Oh ! no . I get a devil . "
30946	30960	30901	30901	he	197	" You ! Why , you 're out of a fairy - tale ! "
30961	31000	30849	30849	Fort	197	" It comes from Daddy - only he does n't know , because he 's a perfect saint ; but I know he 's had a devil somewhere , or he could n't be the saint he is . "
31001	31004	31006	31006	Fort	197	" H'm ! "
31008	31027	31006	31006	Fort	197	" That 's very deep : and I believe it 's true - the saints did have devils . "
31028	31049	30849	30849	Fort	197	" Poor Daddy 's devil has been dead ages . It 's been starved out of him , I think . "
31050	31060	31006	31006	Fort	197	" Does your devil ever get away with you ? "
31078	31087	31072	31072	she	1117	" Yes . It 's a real devil . "
31127	31139	31124	31124	she	1117	" It makes you do things that you want to do . "
31157	31175	31124	31124	she	1117	" And damn the consequences ? I know . It 's rather a jolly thing to have . "
31181	31188	31176	31176	Noel	197	" Here 's Daddy coming back ! "
31195	31214	31189	31189	Fort	197	" I wo n't stay . Good night ; and do n't worry too much , will you ? "
32080	32085	32073	32073	She	131	" Zeps , Daddy ! "
32086	32097	32073	32073	She	131	" Yes , my dear . Where are the maids ? "
32106	32125	32076	32076	her	131	" Here , sir ; trustin ' in God ; but ' tis better on the ground floor . "
32141	32154	32128	32132	a huddle of three figures	1148	" Yes , Yes , Bridgie ; you 're safe down here . "
32188	32197	32182	32182	her	131	" You must come back in , Nollie . "
32198	32209	32213	32213	her	131	" Oh , no ! Cyril has this every day . "
32257	32268	32270	32271	the seers	1151	" Look ! There ! There ! There it is ! "
32306	32317	32301	32301	she	131	" Let 's go up on the roof , Daddy ! "
32339	32346	32347	32347	she	131	" It 's splendid up here ! "
32429	32445	32487	32487	his	122	" A bomb ! Oh ! If we could only get one of the Zeps ! "
32475	32481	32483	32483	Noel	197	" It 's above us ! "
32524	32539	32500	32500	he	122	" What is it ? They 're cheering . Oh ! Daddy , look ! "
32560	32573	32500	32500	he	122	" They 've got it . It 's on fire ! Hurrah ! "
32606	32610	32611	32611	he	122	" Thank God ! "
32670	32677	32678	32678	he	122	" The poor men in it ! "
32681	32685	32678	32678	he	122	" How terrible ! "
32695	32706	32686	32686	Noel	197	" They need n't have come . They 're murderers ! "
32739	32746	32747	32747	he	122	" Let 's pray , Nollie ! "
32750	32796	32747	32747	he	122	" O God , Who in Thy great mercy hath delivered us from peril , take into Thy keeping the souls of these our enemies , consumed by Thy wrath before our eyes ; give us the power to pity them - men like ourselves . "
33117	33124	33125	33125	He	122	" Wot price the orchestra nah ! "
33216	33219	33235	33236	a man	3326	" hundred yards "

33583	33592	33580	33581	his captain	1179	" Ready , boys ? On , then ! "
33833	33840	33826	33829	A voice beside him	1185	" It 's lifted , sir . "
33844	33850	33841	33841	He	122	" Come on , boys ! "
34010	34013	34084	34085	The searcher	1189	" Officer . "
34014	34017	34084	34085	The searcher	1189	" Dead ? "
34018	34021	34084	34085	The searcher	1189	" Sure . "
34022	34025	34084	34085	The searcher	1189	" Search . "
34069	34073	34074	34074	he	1190	" Another boy , "
34077	34083	34074	34074	he	1190	" That all he has ? "
34089	34097	34087	34087	himself	1189	" Just those , and a photo . "
34098	34119	34087	34087	himself	1189	" Dispatch - case ; pound loose ; cigarette - case ; wristwatch ; photo . Let 's see it . "
34149	34152	34154	34155	the searcher	1189	" Noel , "
34159	34176	34087	34087	himself	1189	" H'm ! Take care of it . Stick it in his case . Come on ! "
34299	34334	34291	34291	Leila	183	" Is n't it a wonderful audience , Edward ? Look at all that khaki . Who 'd have thought those young men cared for music - good music - German music , too ? "
34362	34376	34389	34389	She	183	" I wish I could get an audience like that in my church . "
34454	34459	34445	34445	she	183	" Look at Noel ! "
34500	34562	34497	34497	Leila	183	" Does she get news of her boy ? Do you remember that May Week , Edward ? We were very young then ; even you were young . That was such a pretty little letter you wrote me . I can see you still - wandering in your dress clothes along the river , among the ' holy ' cows . "
34635	34679	34763	34765	This Captain Fort	197	" Queer world , Mr. Pierson ! Fancy those boys having to go back to barrack life after listening to that ! What 's your feeling ? Are we moving back to the apes ? Did we touch top note with that Sonata ? "
34688	34721	34680	34680	Pierson	156	" No , Captain Fort , I do not think we are moving back to the apes ; if we ever came from them . Those boys have the souls of heroes ! "
34722	34735	34680	34680	Pierson	156	" I know that , sir , perhaps better than you do . "
34736	34741	34743	34743	Pierson	156	" Ah ! yes , "
34746	34753	34743	34743	Pierson	156	" I forgot , of course . "
35004	35013	34980	34980	He	122	" Do you like Captain Fort , Nollie ? "
35014	35023	35179	35179	Noel	197	" Yes ; he 's a nice man . "
35024	35047	34980	34980	He	122	" He seems a nice man , certainly ; he has a nice smile , but strange views , I 'm afraid . "
35048	35073	35179	35179	Noel	197	" He thinks the Germans are not much worse than we are ; he says that a good many of us are bullies too . "
35074	35086	34980	34980	He	122	" Yes , that is the sort of thing I mean . "
35087	35094	35179	35179	Noel	197	" But are we , Daddy ? "
35095	35099	34980	34980	He	122	" Surely not . "
35100	35157	35179	35179	Noel	197	" A policeman I talked to once said the same . Captain Fort says that very few men can stand having power put into their hands without being spoiled . He told me some dreadful stories . He says we have no imagination , so that we often do things without seeing how brutal they are . "
35158	35178	34980	34980	He	122	" We 're not perfect , Nollie ; but on the whole I think we 're a kind people . "
35189	35213	35179	35179	Noel	197	" Kind people often think others are kind too , when they really are n't . Captain Fort does n't make that mistake . "
35214	35228	34980	34980	He	122	" I think he 's a little cynical , and a little dangerous . "
35229	35243	35179	35179	Noel	197	" Are all people dangerous who do n't think like others , Daddy ? "
35270	35300	35261	35261	He	122	" Not quite so bad as that , Nollie ; but Mr. Fort is certainly subversive . I think perhaps he has seen too many queer sides of life . "
35301	35310	35261	35261	He	122	" I like him the better for that . "
35311	35316	35261	35261	He	122	" Well , well , "
35868	35878	35848	35848	he	197	" Come in here a moment , my darling ! "
35890	35897	35879	35879	Noel	197	" I know already , Daddy . "
35943	35959	35916	35916	He	122	" There is no death ; look forward to seeing him again ; God is merciful "
35974	35983	35984	35984	he	122	" You are very brave , my child ! "
35987	35998	36043	36043	him	122	" There 's nothing else to be , is there ? "
35999	36012	36043	36043	him	122	" Is n't there anything I can do for you , Nollie ? "
36013	36018	36043	36043	him	122	" No , Daddy . "
36019	36026	36043	36043	him	122	" When did you see it ? "
36027	36031	36032	36032	She	131	" Last night . "
36045	36053	36043	36043	him	122	" Have you prayed , my darling ? "
36054	36057	36043	36043	him	122	" No . "
36058	36063	36043	36043	him	122	" Try , Nollie ! "
36064	36067	36043	36043	him	122	" No . "
36068	36073	36043	36043	him	122	" Ah , try ! "
36074	36087	36043	36043	him	122	" It would be ridiculous , Daddy ; you do n't know . "
36102	36121	36093	36093	Pierson	137	" You look dreadfully tired . Would you like a hot bath , and your dinner in bed ? "
36122	36133	36135	36135	she	131	" I 'd like some tea ; that 's all . "
36334	36395	36322	36325	the world - force	1245	" You were young , you were beautiful , you still have beauty , you are not , can not be , old . Cling to youth , cling to beauty ; take all you can get , before your face gets lines and your hair grey ; it is impossible that you have been loved for the last time . "
36495	36498	36491	36491	she	183	" Penny ? "
36505	36510	36500	36500	he	175	" Tell you afterwards . "

36960	36963	36964	36964	he	175	" Live ? "
36967	36975	36964	36964	he	175	" Why ! Do n't you always ? "
36997	37024	36978	36978	her	183	" I have n't lived for two years . Oh , Jimmy ! Help me to live a little ! Life 's so short , now . "

37749	37762	37712	37712	She	208	" Noel . The boy she was fond of has been killed . "
37768	37781	37763	37763	She	208	" Oh , no ! Poor child ! It 's too cruel ! "
37799	37813	37791	37791	she	208	" Poor , poor little Noel ! Was she very fond of him ? "
37814	37876	37791	37791	she	208	" A very sudden , short engagement ; but I 'm afraid she takes it desperately to heart . I do n't know how to comfort her ; only a woman could . I came to ask you : Do you think she ought to go on with her work ? What do you think , Leila ? I feel lost ! "
37899	37907	37908	37908	she	208	" I should let her go on , "
37911	37967	37908	37908	she	208	" it helps ; it 's the only thing that does help . I 'll see if I can get them to let her come into the wards . She ought to be in touch with suffering and the men ; that kitchen work will try her awfully just now : Was he very young ? "
37968	37983	37998	37998	she	208	" Yes . They wanted to get married . I was opposed to it . "
38001	38045	37998	37998	she	208	" I could n't bear to think of Nollie giving herself hastily , like that ; they had only known each other three weeks . It was very hard for me , Leila . And then suddenly he was sent to the front . "
38122	38139	38118	38118	He	1278	" Oh , no ! dear Leila - you must n't love - it 's sin ! "
38147	38157	38158	38158	she	208	" I think the most dreadful thing in life , "
38162	38201	38158	38158	she	208	" is the way people suppress their natural instincts ; what they suppress in themselves they make other people suppress too , if they can ; and that 's the cause of half the misery in this world . "
38225	38240	38221	38221	she	208	" I hope Noel will get over it quickly , and find someone else . "
38241	38265	38221	38221	she	208	" Yes . If they had been married - how much worse it would have been . Thank God , they were n't ! "
38266	38293	38221	38221	she	208	" I do n't know . They would have had an hour of bliss . Even an hour of bliss is worth something in these days . "
38294	38307	38221	38221	she	208	" To those who only believe in this ' life - perhaps . "
38346	38383	38332	38332	he	1278	" I 'm so sorry , Edward . If I can help in any way - I 'll try my best with Noel to - morrow ; and do come to me whenever you feel inclined . "

39171	39183	39160	39160	Leila	208	" There , there ; my love ! There , there ! "
39238	39304	39229	39229	her	525	" I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't sleep . I want him back ; I hate life - I hate the world . We had n't done anything - only just loved each other . God likes punishing ; just because we loved each other ; we had only one day to love each other - only one day - only one ! "
39348	39383	39434	39434	Noel	197	" I wo n't - I do n't want to live . If there 's another life , I shall go to him . And if there is n't - it 's just sleep . "

39643	39650	39712	39713	the girl	525	" Was it wrong , Leila ? "
39651	39681	39588	39588	she	208	" Wrong ? I do n't know - wrong ? If it really is so - it was - unfortunate . But surely , surely - you 're mistaken ? "
39687	39708	39682	39682	Noel	197	" I did it so that we should belong to each other . Nothing could have taken him from me . "
39717	39734	39712	39713	the girl	525	" Then , my dear - he has n't quite gone from you , you see ? "
39740	39742	39712	39713	the girl	525	" No "
39747	39751	39752	39752	she	208	" But Daddy ! "

39828	39854	40005	40005	she	208	" I could never lie to Daddy . But it does n't matter . Why should one go on living , when life is rotten ? "
39883	39887	39888	39888	she	208	" My dear , "
39893	40003	39888	39888	she	208	" you must n't get morbid . Look at me ! I 've had two husbands , and - and - well , a pretty stormy up and down time of it ; and I daresay I 've got lots of trouble before me . But I 'm not going to cave in . Nor must you . The Piersons have plenty of pluck ; you must n't be a traitor to your blood . That 's the last thing . Your boy would have told you to stick it . These are your ' trenches , ' and you 're not going to be downed , are you ? "
40018	40026	40015	40015	Noel	197	" Give me a cigarette , Leila . "
40036	40041	40042	40042	she	208	" That 's brave , "
40045	40062	40042	40042	she	208	" Nothing 's incurable at your age . Only one thing 's incurable - getting old . "
40066	40076	40063	40063	Noel	197	" That 's curable too , is n't it ? "
40077	40082	40063	40063	Noel	197	" Not without surrender . "
40174	40179	40180	40180	she	208	" Play to me , "
40183	40195	40180	40180	she	208	" no - do n't ; I 'll play to you . "

40317	40355	40312	40312	Noel	197	" I 'm quite all right now , Leila ; thank you awfully . I shall just go home and lie down . And I shall come to - morrow , the same as usual . Goodbye ! "

41119	41136	41137	41137	He	384	" Nothing ? To faint like that ? Come , my child . To please me . "
41149	41195	41137	41137	He	384	" No , Daddy . I wo n't see a doctor . Extravagance in wartime ! I wo n't . It 's no good trying to make me . I 'll come down if you like ; I shall be all right to - morrow . "
41254	41268	41249	41249	he	384	" I wish I could be a mother to you , my child ! "

41437	41641	41423	41425	VI 1 Pierson	210	" If you can get leave for a few days , my dear , I want you at home . I am troubled about Nollie . Ever since that disaster happened to her she has been getting paler ; and to - day she fainted . She wo n't see a doctor , but perhaps you could get her to see George . If you come up , he will surely be able to run up to us for a day or two . If not , you must take her down to him at the sea . I have just seen the news of your second cousin Charlie Pierson 's death ; he was killed in one of the last attacks on the Somme ; he was nephew of my cousin Leila whom , as you know , Noel sees every day at her hospital . Bertram has the D. S. O. I have been less hard - pressed lately ; Lauder has been home on leave and has taken some Services for me . And now the colder weather has come , I am feeling much fresher . Try your best to come . I am seriously concerned for our beloved child .

41836	41855	41856	41856	He	1334	" That 's very pretty , Edward ; but you should , you know - for a tonic . "
41863	41897	41812	41812	She	208	" You 're a temptress , Leila . Will you let Nollie know , please , that we can take her back with us ? Can you let her off to - morrow ? "
41898	41948	41968	41968	Leila	208	" For as long as you like ; she wants a rest . I 've been talking to Gratian . We ought n't to have let her go on after a shock like that - my fault , I 'm afraid . I thought that work might be best . "
42165	42169	42155	42155	Gratian	127	" Come in . "
42221	42229	42208	42208	Noel	197	" I asked her to tell you . "

42334	42362	42329	42329	she	1358	" I hate sympathy from people who ca n't understand . I do n't want anyone 's . I can always go away , and lose myself . "

42375	42380	42381	42381	she	127	" I can understand , "

42420	42430	42399	42399	her	1358	" Besides you would never have done it yourself . "
42541	42544	42550	42550	Noel	197	" Dad ! "

42604	42670	42601	42601	she	127	" It was I. He was my husband , as much as yours is . If you say a word against him , I 'll never speak to you again : I 'm glad , and you would be , if you were going to have one . What 's the difference , except that you 've had luck , and I - have n't . "
42702	42711	42712	42712	she	127	" Do you mind if I tell George ? "

43469	43509	43430	43430	his	554	" But father ! It 's impossible to keep it from him , and impossible to tell him ! Oh George ! I never knew what family pride was till now . It 's incredible . That wretched boy ! "
43510	43563	43430	43430	his	554	" ' De mortuis . ' Come , Gracie ! In the midst of death we are in life ! Nollie was a plumb little idiot . But it 's the war - the war ! Your father must get used to it ; it 's a rare chance for his Christianity . "
43564	43581	43430	43430	his	554	" Dad will be as sweet as anything - that 's what makes it so horrible ! "
43588	43643	43585	43585	his	140	" Quite right ! The old - fashioned father could let himself go . But need he know ? We can get her away from London , and later on , we must manage somehow . If he does hear , we must make him feel that Nollie was ' doing her bit . ' "
43649	43653	43654	43654	she	127	" Do n't ! "

43834	43860	43831	43831	he	140	" I know ; but it 'll all come right , if we put a good face on it . Shall I talk to Nollie ? "
43876	43882	43831	43831	he	140	" George is seeing her ! "
43941	43945	43947	43947	he	140	" a little bit "
44166	44188	44153	44153	his	140	" Gratian 's told me , Nollie . The great thing is to keep your spirit up , and not worry . "
44189	44198	44153	44153	his	140	" I suppose you could n't cure me . "
44217	44233	44213	44213	he	140	" Out of the question , Nollie ; impossible ! What are you thinking of ? "
44234	44237	44213	44213	he	140	" Daddy . "

44261	44306	44253	44253	he	140	" Bless him ! We shall have to see to all that . Do you really want to keep it from him ? It must be one way or the other ; no use concealing it , if it 's to come out later . "
44307	44310	44316	44316	her	1410	" No . "
44342	44350	44351	44351	he	140	" I should n't do anything yet , "
44354	44386	44351	44351	he	140	" too early . Later on , if you 'd like me to tell him . But that 's entirely up to you , my dear ; he need never know . "

44402	44434	44399	44399	she	1410	" Gratian condemns Cyril . Do n't let her . I wo n't have him badly thought of . It was my doing . I wanted to make sure of him . "
44439	44569	44435	44435	George	140	" Gracie 's upset , of course , but she 'll soon be all right . You must n't let it come between you . The thing you 've got to keep steadily before you is that life 's a huge wide adaptable thing . Look at all these people ! There 's hardly one of them who has n't got now , or has n't had , some personal difficulty or trouble before them as big as yours almost ; bigger perhaps . And here they are as lively as fleas . That 's what makes the fascination of life - the jolly irony of it all . It would do you good to have a turn in France , and see yourself in proportion to the whole . "
44587	44830	44572	44572	her	1411	" Life 's going to be the important thing in the future , Nollie ; not comfort and cloistered virtue and security ; but living , and pressure to the square inch . Do you twig ? All the old hard - and - fast traditions and drags on life are in the melting - pot . Death 's boiling their bones , and they 'll make excellent stock for the new soup . When you prune and dock things , the sap flows quicker . Regrets and repinings and repressions are going out of fashion ; we shall have no time or use for them in the future . You 're going to make life - well , that 's something to be thankful for , anyway . You 've kept Cyril Morland alive . And - well , you know , we 've all been born ; some of us properly , and some improperly , and there is n't a ha'porth of difference in the value of the article , or the trouble of bringing it into the world . The cheerier you are the better your child will be , and that 's all you 've got to think about . You need n't begin to trouble at all for another couple of months , at least ; after that , just let us know where you 'd like to go , and I 'll arrange it somehow . "

She was still obstinately biting at her hand , and suddenly her chin flew up , and there , between her teeth , was the needle . She took it from them with her other hand , stuck it proudly in the front of her dress , and out tumbled the words : "
46032	46032	46027	46027	I	0	"
46050	46057	46040	46040	she	1441	" Thank you kindly , miss ! "
46088	46097	46098	46098	she	1441	" You ca n't go back to work , "
46104	46110	46098	46098	she	1441	" Where do you live ? "
46111	46117	46040	46040	she	1441	" ' Ornsey , miss . "
46118	46153	46098	46098	she	1441	" You must take a ' bus and go straight home , and put your hand at once into weak Condy 's fluid and water . It 's swelling . Here 's five shillings . "
46154	46180	46040	46040	she	1441	" Yes , miss ; thank you , miss , I 'm sure . It 's very kind of you . It does ache cruel . "
46181	46199	46098	46098	she	1441	" If it 's not better this afternoon , you must go to a doctor . Promise ! "
46200	46220	46040	46040	she	1441	" Oh , dear , yes . ' Ere 's my ' bus . Thank you kindly , miss . "

46501	46552	46494	46494	he	1457	" Forgive me the liberty I take , mademoiselle , but would you so very kindly allow me to make a sketch of you sitting there ? I work very quick . I beg you will let me . I am Belgian , and have no manners , you see . "
46557	46562	46564	46564	Noel	197	" If you like , "
46566	46573	46564	46564	Noel	197	" I thank you very much : "
46612	46620	46621	46621	she	1460	" Have you been long in England ? "
46625	46635	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" Ever since the first months of the war . "
46636	46642	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" Do you like it ? "
46643	46665	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" I was very homesick at first . But I live in my pictures ; there are wonderful things in London . "
46666	46675	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" Why did you want to sketch me ? "
46681	46803	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" Mademoiselle , youth is so mysterious . Those young trees I have been painting mean so much more than the old big trees . Your eyes are seeing things that have not yet happened . There is Fate in them , and a look of defending us others from seeing it . We have not such faces in my country ; we are simpler ; we do not defend our expressions . The English are very mysterious . We are like children to them . Yet in some ways you are like children to us . You are not people of the world at all . You English have been good to us , but you do not like us . "
46804	46816	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" And I suppose you do not like us , either ? "
46830	46863	46676	46677	The painter	1461	" Well , not very much . The English do things from duty , but their hearts they keep to themselves . And their Art - well , that is really amusing ! "
46864	46873	46874	46874	Noel	197	" I do n't know much about Art , "
46877	46885	46887	46888	the painter	1461	" It is the world to me , "
46901	46910	46911	46911	he	1462	" It is so difficult to get subjects , "
46915	46956	46911	46911	he	1462	" I can not afford to pay models , and they are not fond of me painting out of doors . If I had always a subject like you ! You - you have a grief , have you not ? "
46969	46975	46963	46963	Noel	197	" Everybody has , now . "
46989	46992	46993	46993	he	1461	" Yes , "
46996	47023	46993	46993	he	1461	" everybody . Tragedy is daily bread . I have lost my family ; they are in Belgium . How they live I do not know . "
47024	47049	46976	46977	The painter	1461	" I 'm sorry ; very sorry , too , if we are n't nice to you , here . We ought to be . "
47055	47123	47050	47050	He	1461	" What would you have ? We are different . That is unpardonable . An artist is always lonely , too ; he has a skin fewer than other people , and he sees things that they do not . People do not like you to be different . If ever in your life you act differently from others , you will find it so , mademoiselle . "
47145	47151	47152	47152	she	1466	" Have you nearly finished ? "
47155	47185	47130	47130	he	1461	" No , mademoiselle ; I could go on for hours ; but I do not wish to keep you . It is cold for you , sitting there . "
47190	47195	47186	47186	Noel	197	" May I look ? "
47196	47199	47200	47200	She	1466	" Certainly . "
47240	47246	47247	47248	the painter	1461	" My name is Lavendie , "
47251	47259	47261	47261	he	1461	" my wife and I live here , "
47273	47290	47292	47292	she	1466	" My name is Noel Pierson ; I live with my father ; here 's the address "
47303	47325	47292	47292	she	1466	" My father is a clergyman ; would you care to come and see him ? He loves music and painting . "
47326	47351	47397	47398	The painter	1461	" It would be a great pleasure ; and perhaps I might be allowed to paint you . Alas ! I have no studio . "
47356	47396	47352	47352	Noel	222	" I 'm afraid that I work in a hospital all day , and - and I do n't want to be painted , thank you . But , Daddy would like to meet you , I 'm sure . "
47409	47423	47424	47424	she	1470	" Of course I can see that you 're a very fine painter , "
47428	47458	47424	47424	she	1470	" only - only - I do n't want to , you see . Perhaps you 'd like to paint Daddy ; he 's got a most interesting face . "
47463	47487	47459	47460	The painter	1461	" He is your father , mademoiselle . May I ask you one question ? Why do you not want to be painted ? "
47488	47500	47501	47501	She	1470	" Because - because I do n't , I 'm afraid . "
47513	47519	47507	47508	The painter	1461	" Au revoir , mademoiselle . "
47520	47524	47526	47526	Noel	222	" Thank you , "
47528	47534	47526	47526	Noel	222	" it was awfully interesting . "
47607	47616	47604	47604	his	1461	" If ever you act differently from others , "
47674	47679	47681	47683	an unknown painter	1481	" Rape of Europa , "
47883	47892	47873	47873	She	1470	" I expect he 'll come , Daddy . "
47897	47912	47893	47893	Pierson	222	" Poor fellow , I shall be glad to see him if he does . "
47913	47925	47967	47967	She	1491	" And you 'll sit to him , wo n't you ? "
47926	47932	47893	47893	Pierson	222	" My dear - I ? "
47933	47966	47967	47967	She	1491	" He 's lonely , you know , and people are n't nice to him . Is n't it hateful that people should hurt others , because they 're foreign or different ? "
47980	47999	47967	47967	She	1491	" I know you think people are charitable , Daddy , but they are n't , of course . "
48000	48009	47967	47967	She	1491	" That 's not exactly charitable , Nollie . "
48010	48050	47967	47967	She	1491	" You know they 're not . I think sin often just means doing things differently . It 's not real sin when it only hurts yourself ; but that does n't prevent people condemning you , does it ? "
48051	48062	47967	47967	She	1491	" I do n't know what you mean , Nollie . "
48071	48082	48063	48063	Noel	222	" Are you sure we 're really Christians , Daddy ? "
48104	48121	48095	48095	Pierson	222	" I should like notice of that question , Nollie , as they say in Parliament . "
48122	48129	48090	48090	his	1492	" That means you do n't . "
48133	48166	48130	48130	Pierson	222	" We 're fallible enough ; but , do n't get such ideas into your head , my child . There 's a lot of rebellious talk and writing in these days .... "
48175	48179	48180	48180	she	1491	" I think , "
48194	48237	48180	48180	she	1491	" that Christianity is what you do , not what you think or say . And I do n't believe people can be Christians when they act like others - I mean , when they join together to judge and hurt people . "
48245	48258	48259	48259	he	222	" You have not seen enough of life to talk like that , "
48267	48380	48263	48263	Noel	222	" One of the men in her hospital told Gratian about the treatment of conscientious objectors - it was horrible . Why do they treat them like that , just because they disagree ? Captain Fort says it 's fear which makes people bullies . But how can it be fear when they 're hundreds to one ? He says man has domesticated his animals but has never succeeded in domesticating himself . Man must be a wild beast , you know , or the world could n't be so awfully brutal . I do n't see much difference between being brutal for good reasons , and being brutal for bad ones . "
49089	49095	49087	49087	he	175	" that little fairy princess . "
49225	49252	49215	49215	she	1512	" Do you know that your fairy princess , as you call her , is going to have what is known as a war - baby ? "
49257	49260	49256	49256	his	175	" What ! "
49277	49304	49273	49273	She	1512	" She came and told me all about it . The boy is dead , as you know . Yes , terrible , is n't it ? "
49323	49333	49256	49256	his	175	" That lovely child ! But it 's impossible ! "
49334	49343	49273	49273	She	1512	" The impossible is sometimes true , Jimmy . "
49344	49351	49256	49256	his	175	" I refuse to believe it . "
49352	49360	49361	49361	she	1512	" I tell you it is so , "
49365	49371	49256	49256	his	175	" What a ghastly shame ! "
49372	49385	49256	49256	his	175	" It was her own doing ; she said so , herself . "
49386	49397	49256	49256	his	175	" And her father - the padre ! My God ! "
49568	49584	49564	49564	she	174	" Do n't look like that , Jimmy . I 'm sorry I told you . "
49600	49619	49597	49597	he	175	" Well , I do think that 's the limit . What 's to be done for her ? "
49624	49636	49620	49620	Leila	174	" Nothing , I 'm afraid . Do you love me ? "
49644	49648	49638	49638	she	174	" Of course . "
50035	50039	50096	50096	he	175	" my daughter Gratian "
50045	50055	50076	50076	he	175	" my son - in - law George Laird , "
50148	50159	50145	50145	he	175	" Please go on , and let me chip in . "
50160	50171	50173	50176	the man in khaki	1546	" We were quarrelling about the Universe , Captain Fort , "
50178	50216	50173	50176	the man in khaki	1546	" delighted to have your help . I was just saying that this particular world has no particular importance , no more than a newspaper - seller would accord to it if it were completely destroyed tomorrow - "
50348	50389	50343	50343	you	221	" The thin - faced , big - eyed man put up his hand to his high , veined brow as if he had a headache , reddened , and began to speak in French , which Fort followed with difficulty .
50390	50885	50886	50886	He	1552	" For me the Universe is a limitless artist , monsieur , who from all time and to all time is ever expressing himself in differing forms - always trying to make a masterpiece , and generally failing . For me this world , and all the worlds , are like ourselves , and the flowers and trees - little separate works of art , more or less perfect , whose little lives run their course , and are spilled or powdered back into this Creative Artist , whence issue ever fresh attempts at art . I agree with Monsieur Laird , if I understand him right ; but I agree also with Madame Laird , if I understand her . You see , I think mind and matter are one , or perhaps there is no such thing as either mind or matter , only growth and decay and growth again , for ever and ever ; but always conscious growth - an artist expressing himself in millions of ever - changing forms ; decay and death as we call them , being but rest and sleep , the ebbing of the tide , which must ever come between two rising tides , or the night which comes between two days . But the next day is never the same as the day before , nor the tide as the last tide ; so the little shapes of the world and of ourselves , these works of art by the Eternal Artist , are never renewed in the same form , are never twice alike , but always fresh - fresh worlds , fresh individuals , fresh flowers , fresh everything . I do not see anything depressing in that . To me it would be depressing to think that I would go on living after death , or live again in a new body , myself yet not myself . How stale that would be ! When I finish a picture it is inconceivable to me that this picture should ever become another picture , or that one can divide the expression from the mind - stuff it has expressed . The Great Artist who is the whole of Everything , is ever in fresh effort to achieve new things . He is as a fountain who throws up new drops , no two ever alike , which fall back into the water , flow into the pipe , and so are thrown up again in fresh - shaped drops . But I can not explain why there should be this Eternal Energy , ever expressing itself in fresh individual shapes , this Eternal Working Artist , instead of nothing at all - just empty dark for always ; except indeed that it must be one thing or the other , either all or nothing ; and it happens to be this and not that , the all and not the nothing . "
50945	50990	50935	50935	his	1546	" Bravo , monsieur ; Jolly well put from the artist 's point of view . The idea is pretty , anyway ; but is there any need for an idea at all ? Things are ; and we have just to take them . "
51019	51025	51026	51026	he	1552	" I can not admit , "
51030	51091	51026	51026	he	1552	" the identity of the Creator with the created . God exists outside ourselves . Nor can I admit that there is no defnite purpose and fulfilment . All is shaped to His great ends . I think we are too given to spiritual pride . The world has lost reverence ; I regret it , I bitterly regret it . "
51092	51098	51100	51103	the man in khaki	1546	" I rejoice at it , "
51105	51116	51100	51103	the man in khaki	1546	" Now , Captain Fort , your turn to bat ! "
51134	51235	51127	51127	himself	197	" I think what monsieur calls expression , I call fighting . I suspect the Universe of being simply a long fight , a sum of conquests and defeats . Conquests leading to defeats , defeats to conquests . I want to win while I 'm alive , and because I want to win , I want to live on after death . Death is a defeat . I do n't want to admit it . While I have that instinct , I do n't think I shall really die ; when I lose it , I think I shall . "
51258	51318	51252	51252	she	1557	" I suspect that what we call spirit is just the fighting instinct ; that what we call matter is the mood of lying down . Whether , as Mr. Pierson says , God is outside us , or , as monsieur thinks , we are all part of God , I do n't know , I 'm sure . "
51319	51326	51328	51331	the man in khaki	1546	" Ah ! There we are ! "
51333	51410	51328	51331	the man in khaki	1546	" We all speak after our temperaments , and none of us know . The religions of the world are just the poetic expressions of certain strongly marked temperaments . Monsieur was a poet just now , and his is the only temperament which has never yet been rammed down the world 's throat in the form of religion . Go out and proclaim your views from the housetops , monsieur , and see what happens . "
51434	51439	51440	51440	he	1461	" Non , monsieur , "
51443	51554	51440	51440	he	1461	" the artist does not wish to impose his temperament . Difference of temperament is the very essence of his joy , and his belief in life . Without difference there would be no life for him . ' Tout casse , tout lasse , ' but change goes on for ever : We artists reverence change , monsieur ; we reverence the newness of each morning , of each night , of each person , of each expression of energy . Nothing is final for us ; we are eager for all and always for more . We are in love , you see , even with - death . "
51566	51579	51563	51563	Pierson	156	" That is beautiful , monsieur ; but oh ! how wrong ! "
51580	51589	51591	51594	the man in khaki	1546	" And what do you think , Nollie ? "
51646	51657	51633	51633	she	525	" I do n't know ; I was n't listening . "
51678	51736	51674	51674	He	197	" These are times of action . Philosophy seems to mean nothing nowadays . The one thing is to hate tyranny and cruelty , and protect everything that 's weak and lonely . It 's all that 's left to make life worth living , when all the packs of all the world are out for blood . "
51748	51791	51743	51743	he	197	" Why ! Even we who started out to fight this Prussian pack , have caught the pack feeling - so that it 's hunting all over the country , on every sort of scent . It 's a most infectious thing . "
51792	51806	51743	51743	he	197	" I can not see that we are being infected , Captain Fort . "
51807	51846	51743	51743	he	197	" I 'm afraid we are , Mr. Pierson . The great majority of people are always inclined to run with the hounds ; the pressure 's great just now ; the pack spirit 's in the air . "
51852	51861	51862	51862	he	156	" No , I can not see it , "
51865	51881	51862	51862	he	156	" it seems to me that we are all more brotherly , and more tolerant . "
51882	51889	51892	51893	the painter	1461	" Ah ! monsieur le cure , "
51898	52038	51892	51893	the painter	1461	" it is difficult for a good man to see the evil round him . There are those whom the world 's march leaves apart , and reality can not touch . They walk with God , and the bestialities of us animals are fantastic to them . The spirit of the pack , as monsieur says , is in the air . I see all human nature now , running with gaping mouths and red tongues lolling out , their breath and their cries spouting thick before them . On whom they will fall next - one never knows ; the innocent with the guilty . Perhaps if you were to see some one dear to you devoured before your eyes , monsieur le cure , you would feel it too ; and yet I do not know . "
52153	52161	52163	52164	the painter	1461	" Ah ! c'est vous , monsieur ! "
52171	52178	52180	52180	Fort	197	" Are you going my way ? "
52182	52191	52180	52180	Fort	197	" I go slowly , I 'm afraid . "
52192	52245	52163	52164	the painter	1461	" The slower the better , monsieur . London is so beautiful in the dark . It is the despair of the painter - these moonlit nights . There are moments when one feels that reality does not exist . All is in dreams - like the face of that young lady . "
52253	52265	52246	52246	Fort	197	" Oh ! She strikes you like that , does she ? "
52266	52301	52302	52302	He	384	" Ah ! What a charming figure ! What an atmosphere of the past and future round her ! And she will not let me paint her ! Well , perhaps only Mathieu Maris . "
52317	52320	52322	52322	Fort	197	" Yes , "
52346	52346	52341	52341	I	0	"
52359	52708	52347	52348	The painter	1461	" She has youth and age all at once - that is rare . Her father is an interesting man , too ; I am trying to paint him ; he is very difficult . He sits lost in some kind of vacancy of his own ; a man whose soul has gone before him somewhere , like that of his Church , escaped from this age of machines , leaving its body behind - is it not ? He is so kind ; a saint , I think . The other clergymen I see passing in the street are not at all like him ; they look buttoned - up and busy , with faces of men who might be schoolmasters or lawyers , or even soldiers - men of this world . Do you know this , monsieur - it is ironical , but it is true , I think a man can not be a successful priest unless he is a man of this world . I do not see any with that look of Monsieur Pierson , a little tortured within , and not quite present . He is half an artist , really a lover of music , that man . I am painting him at the piano ; when he is playing his face is alive , but even then , so far away . To me , monsieur , he is exactly like a beautiful church which knows it is being deserted . I find him pathetic . Je suis socialiste , but I have always an aesthetic admiration for that old Church , which held its children by simple emotion . The times have changed ; it can no longer hold them so ; it stands in the dusk , with its spire to a heaven which exists no more , its bells , still beautiful but out of tune with the music of the streets . It is something of that which I wish to get into my picture of Monsieur Pierson ; and sapristi ! it is difficult ! "
52733	52741	52744	52745	the painter	1461	" To do it , you see , "
52747	52793	52744	52745	the painter	1461	" one should have the proper background - these currents of modern life and modern types , passing him and leaving him untouched . There is no illusion , and no dreaming , in modern life . Look at this street . La , la ! "
52851	53059	52846	52846	his	1461	" How am I to get into my picture this modern life , which washes round him as round that church , there , standing in the middle of the street ? See how the currents sweep round it , as if to wash it away ; yet it stands , seeming not to see them . If I were a phantasist , it would be easy enough : but to be a phantasist is too simple for me - those romantic gentlemen bring what they like from anywhere , to serve their ends . Moi , je suis realiste . And so , monsieur , I have invented an idea . I am painting over his head while he sits there at the piano a picture hanging on the wall - of one of these young town girls who have no mysteriousness at all , no youth ; nothing but a cheap knowledge and defiance , and good humour . He is looking up at it , but he does not see it . I will make the face of that girl the face of modern life , and he shall sit staring at it , seeing nothing . What do you think of my idea ? "
53086	53092	53093	53093	he	197	" It sounds all right , "
53097	53219	53093	53093	he	197	" all the same , monsieur , all my sympathy is with modern life . Take these young girls , and these Tommies . For all their feather - pated vulgarity and they are damned vulgar , I must say - they 're marvellous people ; they do take the rough with the smooth ; they 're all ' doing their bit , ' you know , and facing this particularly beastly world . Aesthetically , I daresay , they 're deplorable , but can you say that on the whole their philosophy is n't an advance on anything we 've had up till now ? They worship nothing , it 's true ; but they keep their ends up marvellously . "
53239	53270	53272	53272	he	1461	" I am not concerned with that , monsieur ; I set down what I see ; better or worse , I do not know . But look at this ! "
53345	53348	53349	53349	he	1461	" Ah ! "
53352	53381	53349	53349	he	1461	" what beauty ! And they do n't see it - not one in a thousand ! Pity , is n't it ? Beauty is the holy thing ! "
53392	53399	53400	53400	he	197	" Every man to his vision ! "
53403	53450	53400	53400	he	197	" My leg 's beginning to bother me ; I 'm afraid I must take a cab . Here 's my address ; any time you like to come . I 'm often in about seven . I ca n't take you anywhere , I suppose ? "
53451	53509	53510	53510	He	1583	" A thousand thanks , monsieur ; but I go north . I loved your words about the pack . I often wake at night and hear the howling of all the packs of the world . Those who are by nature gentle nowadays feel they are strangers in a far land . Good night , monsieur ! "
54493	54499	54500	54500	He	1583	" Yes , Mrs. Mitchett ? "
54520	54594	54507	54508	The woman	586	" It 's ' Ilda , sir . Such a thing Mitchett and me never could ' ave expected , comin ' on us so sudden . I thought it best to bring ' er round , poor girl . Of course , it 's all the war . I 've warned ' er a dozen times ; but there it is , comin ' next month , and the man in France . "
54643	54648	54649	54649	he	122	" That is sad , "
54652	54658	54649	54649	he	122	" very , very sad . "
54659	54662	54664	54665	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" Yes , "
54667	54676	54664	54665	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" that 's what I tell ' Ilda . "
54696	54722	54677	54678	The girl	525	" What is the man 's name and regiment ? Perhaps we can get leave for him to come home and marry Hilda at once . "
54727	54747	54723	54724	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" She wo n't give it , sir . Now , ' Ilda , give it to Mr. Pierson . "
54769	54814	54764	54765	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" That 's ' ow she is , sir ; not a word will she say . And as I tell her , we can only think there must ' ave been more than one . And that does put us to shame so ! "
54823	54840	54817	54818	the girl	525	" You speak to her , sir ; I 'm really at my wit 's end . "
54841	54849	54851	54851	Pierson	156	" Why wo n't you tell us ? "
54853	54869	54851	54851	Pierson	156	" The man will want to do the right thing , ' I 'm sure . "
54883	54891	54873	54873	her	525	" I do n't know his name . "
54898	54903	54904	54904	she	230	" Oh , dear ! "
54907	54921	54904	54904	she	230	" Think of that ! She 's never said as much to us . "
54922	54928	54929	54929	Pierson	156	" Not know his name ? "
54932	54940	54941	54941	he	156	" But how - how could you - "
54950	54968	54945	54945	his	156	" Surely you would never have done such a thing without affection ? Come , tell me ! "
54969	54976	54977	54978	the girl	525	" I do n't know it , "
54981	54987	54989	54990	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" It 's these Parks , "
54997	55026	54989	54990	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" And to think that this 'll be our first grandchild and all ! ' Ilda is difficult ; as quiet , as quiet ; but that stubborn - "
55055	55061	55062	55062	he	156	" I ca n't think , "
55065	55079	55062	55062	he	156	" how you could so have forgotten yourself . It 's truly grievous . "
55084	55108	55080	55081	Mrs. Mitchett	230	" Yes , sir ; the girls gets it into their heads that there 's going to be no young men for them . "
55109	55114	55116	55117	the girl	525	" That 's right , "
55126	55139	55140	55140	he	156	" Well , what can I do for you , Mrs. Mitchett ? "
55143	55151	55140	55140	he	156	" Does your daughter come to church ? "
55159	55167	55155	55155	her	230	" Never since she had her byke . "
55190	55193	55194	55194	he	156	" Well , "
55197	55212	55214	55214	he	156	" if you need our creche , you have only to come to me , "
55220	55285	55214	55214	he	156	" And you - wo n't you let this dreadful experience move your heart ? My dear girl , we must all master ourselves , our passions , and our foolish wilfulness , especially in these times when our country needs us strong , and self - disciplined , not thinking of ourselves . I 'm sure you 're a good girl at heart . "
55306	55349	55286	55287	The girl	525	" Your soul is in great danger , and you 're very unhappy , I can see . Turn to God for help , and in His mercy everything will be made so different for you - so very different ! Come ! "
55360	55368	55350	55351	The girl	525	" I do n't want the baby ! "
55384	55391	55393	55394	her mother	377	" ' Ilda was in munitions , "
55400	55423	55393	55394	her mother	377	" earnin ' a matter of four pound a week . Oh ! dear , it is a waste an ' all ! "
55436	55440	55441	55441	he	156	" A judgment ! "
55444	55469	55441	55441	he	156	" Good evening , Mrs. Mitchett . Good evening , Hilda . If you want me when the time comes , send for me . "
55565	55574	55576	55576	Pierson	156	" Are n't you early , my child ? "
55578	55585	55576	55576	Pierson	156	" You came in very quietly . "
55586	55592	55603	55603	her	525	" Yes ; I heard . "
55617	55623	55624	55624	he	156	" What did you hear ? "
55627	55658	55603	55603	her	525	" I heard you say : ' A judgment ! ' You 'll say the same to me , wo n't you ? Only , I do want my baby . "
55746	55749	55739	55739	He	156	" Nollie ! "
55750	55756	55757	55757	she	525	" It 's quite true , "
55990	56003	55984	55985	a man	3326	" My God ! My God ! Why hast Thou forsaken me ! "
56212	56228	56229	56229	It	1673	" How have you cared for Nollie , that she should have come to this ? "
56573	56576	56558	56558	her	1680	" Nollie ! "
56982	56984	56993	56993	She	1694	" do "
57175	57178	57167	57167	Her	1694	" Oh ! "
57200	57203	57167	57167	Her	1694	" that sorry "
57277	57284	57271	57271	she	1694	" Is that you , Bessie ? "
57289	57310	57285	57286	The girl	525	" Yes , sir . I 'm sorry I woke you , sir . ' Appy New Year , sir ! "
57311	57323	57324	57324	She	1694	" Ah , yes . A Happy New Year , Bessie . "
57417	57426	57427	57427	he	156	" A Happy New Year , my child ! "
57501	57526	57497	57497	He	156	" I ca n't realise . I - I hoped I had heard wrong . Did n't I , Nollie ? Did n't I ? "
57533	57539	57540	57540	he	156	" Tell me - everything , "
57543	57549	57540	57540	he	156	" for God 's sake ! "
57561	57618	57619	57619	She	1694	" There 's nothing more . Gratian and George know , and Leila . It ca n't be undone , Daddy . Perhaps I would n't have wanted to make sure , if you had n't tried to stop Cyril and me - and I 'm glad sometimes , because I shall have something of his - "
57625	57694	57619	57619	She	1694	" After all , it 's the same , really ; only , there 's no ring . It 's no good talking to me now , as if I had n't been thinking of this for ages . I 'm used to anything you can say ; I 've said it to myself , you see . There 's nothing but to make the best of it . "
57725	57745	57717	57717	her	1694	" Oh , Daddy ! You do look tired ! Have n't you been to bed ? Poor Daddy ! "
57754	57758	57717	57717	her	1694	" Poor Daddy ! "
57804	57808	57809	57809	she	1694	" Do n't ! "
57828	57845	57818	57818	Pierson	156	" Shall you wish to be at home , my dear , or to go elsewhere ? "
57870	57883	57846	57846	Noel	197	" Oh ! I do n't know ; what does it matter ? "
57884	57903	57904	57904	Noel	197	" Kestrel ; would you like to go there ? Your aunt - I could write to her . "
57919	57922	57923	57923	she	1694	" Yes , "
57926	57936	57923	57923	she	1694	" I would . Only , not Uncle Bob . "
57937	57951	57904	57904	Noel	197	" Perhaps your uncle would come up here , and keep me company . "
57971	57977	57978	57978	she	1694	" I do n't care , "
57981	57989	57978	57978	she	1694	" anywhere - it does n't matter . "
57999	58002	58003	58003	he	156	" Gently ! "
58013	58017	58018	58018	he	156	" Merciful Father , "
58021	58077	58018	58018	he	156	" give us strength to bear this dreadful trial . Keep my beloved child safe , and bring her peace ; and give me to understand how I have done wrong , how I have failed towards Thee , and her . In all things chasten and strengthen her , my child , and me . "
58097	58124	58094	58094	her	1694	" You have n't failed ; why do you talk of failing - it is n't true ; and do n't pray for me , Daddy . "
58165	58188	58148	58148	She	1694	" I shall have a son ; Cyril wo n't quite have died . And I do n't want to be forgiven . "
58300	58351	58360	58360	she	1694	" I want you to know it was all me . But I ca n't pretend . Of course I 'll try and not let it hurt you more than I possibly can . I 'm sorry for you , poor Daddy ; oh ! I 'm sorry for you ! "
58494	58502	58476	58479	X 1 Thirza Pierson	137	" Here 's a letter from Ted . "
58517	58523	58503	58504	Bob Pierson	125	" What does he say ? "
58608	58622	58659	58659	him	133	" He wants you to go up and stay with him , Bob . "
58623	58630	58659	58659	him	133	" Why not both of us ? "
58631	58646	58659	58659	him	133	" He wants Nollie to come down to me ; she 's not well . "
58647	58656	58659	58659	him	133	" Not well ? What 's the matter ? "
58715	58764	58711	58711	She	137	" You remember that night when Cyril Morland went away , and Noel behaved so strangely . Well , my dear ; she is going to have a child at the beginning of April . The poor boy is dead , Bob ; he died for the Country . "
58776	58779	58765	58765	She	137	" What ! "
58780	58798	58801	58801	she	137	" Poor Edward is dreadfully upset . We must do what we can . I blame myself . "
58806	58816	58817	58817	He	133	" Blame yourself ? Stuff ! That young - ! "
58824	58877	58820	58820	Thirza	137	" No , Bob ; of the two , I 'm sure it was Noel ; she was desperate that day . Do n't you remember her face ? Oh ! this war ! It 's turned the whole world upside down . That 's the only comfort ; nothing 's normal . "
59189	59193	59194	59194	he	125	" By Jove ! "
59197	59202	59194	59194	he	125	" what a ghastly thing !
59203	59221	59226	59226	his	125	" Nollie , of all people ! I feel perfectly wretched , Thirza ; wretched beyond words . "
59242	59249	59250	59250	she	137	" Your coffee 's getting cold ! "
59253	59266	59226	59226	his	125	" What do you advise ? Shall I go up , heh ? "
59267	59330	59347	59347	he	1718	" I think you 'll be a godsend to poor Ted ; you 'll keep his spirits up . Eve wo n't get any leave till Easter ; and I can be quite alone , and see to Nollie here . The servants can have a holiday - , Nurse and I will run the house together . I shall enjoy it . "
59331	59340	59347	59347	he	1718	" You 're a good woman , Thirza ! "
59354	59366	59347	59347	he	1718	" There is n't another woman like you in the world . "
59372	59386	59367	59367	Thirza	137	" Pass me your cup ; I 'll give you some fresh coffee . "
59461	59465	59466	59466	he	1718	" By heaven ! "
59470	59498	59466	59466	he	1718	" I simply ca n't get used to it ; in our family ! And Ted a parson ! What the devil shall we do with it ? "
59499	59525	59466	59466	he	1718	" If Nollie will let us , why should n't we adopt it ? It 'll be something to take my thoughts off the boys . "
59526	59553	59466	59466	he	1718	" That 's an idea ! But Ted 's a funny fellow . He 'll have some doctrine of atonement , or other in his bonnet . "
59554	59559	59561	59561	Thirza	137	" Oh , bother ! "
59759	59766	59880	59880	Her	1735	" I shall write every day . "
59767	59774	59880	59880	Her	1735	" So shall I , Bob . "
59775	59784	59880	59880	Her	1735	" You wo n't fret , old girl ? "
59785	59791	59880	59880	Her	1735	" Only if you do . "
59792	59838	59880	59880	Her	1735	" I shall be up at 5.5 , and she 'll be down at 4.50 . Give us a kiss - damn the porters . God bless you ! I suppose she 'd mind if - I - were to come down now and then ? "
59839	59857	59880	59880	Her	1735	" I 'm afraid she would . It 's - it 's - well , you know . "
59858	59866	59868	59868	he	1734	" Yes , Yes ; I do . "
59884	59892	59880	59880	Her	1735	" You 're very sweet , Bob , "
60157	60180	60131	60131	she	1735	" Thank you so much , Auntie , for having me ; it 's most awfully sweet of you and Uncle Bob . "
60181	60220	60236	60236	She	1735	" There 's no one in the house , my dear , except old Nurse . It 'll be very dull for you ; but I thought I 'd teach you to cook ; it 's rather useful . "
60286	60363	60364	60364	She	1735	" You know , Nollie , I absolutely refuse to regard this as any sort of tragedy . To bring life into the worlds in these days , no matter how , ought to make anyone happy . I only wish I could do it again , then I should feel some use . Good night dear ; and if you want anything , knock on the wall . I 'm next door . Bless you ! "
61095	61184	61088	61088	he	123	" He eats nothing , he drinks nothing , he smokes a miserable cigarette once in a blue moon . He 's as lonely as a coot ; it 's a thousand pities he ever lost his wife . I expect to see his wings sprout any day ; but - dash it all I - I do n't believe he 's got the flesh to grow them on . Send him up some clotted cream ; I 'll see if I can get him to eat it . "
61212	61219	61220	61220	he	123	" We never talk about Nollie , "
61223	61433	61220	61220	he	123	" I 'm always meaning to have it out with him and tell him to buck up , but when it comes to the point I dry up ; because , after all , I feel it too ; it sticks in my gizzard horribly . We Piersons are pretty old , and we 've always been respectable , ever since St. Bartholomew , when that Huguenot chap came over and founded us . The only black sheep I ever heard of is Cousin Leila . By the way , I saw her the other day ; she came round here to see Ted . I remember going to stay with her and her first husband ; young Fane , at Simla , when I was coming home , just before we were married . Phew ! That was a queer menage ; all the young chaps fluttering round her , and young Fane looking like a cynical ghost . Even now she ca n't help setting her cap a little at Ted , and he swallows her whole ; thinks her a devoted creature reformed to the nines with her hospital and all that . Poor old Ted ; he is the most dreamy chap that ever was . "
61434	61449	61450	61450	he	1782	" We have had Gratian and her husband up for the week - end , "
61456	61687	61450	61450	he	1782	" I do n't like her so well as Nollie ; too serious and downright for me . Her husband seems a sensible fellow , though ; but the devil of a free - thinker . He and poor Ted are like cat and dog . We had Leila in to dinner again on Saturday , and a man called Fort came too . She 's sweet on him , I could see with half an eye , but poor old Ted ca n't . The doctor and Ted talked up hill and down dale . The doctor said a thing which struck me . ' What divides us from the beasts ? Will power : nothing else . What 's this war , really , but a death carnival of proof that man 's will is invincible ? ' I stuck it down to tell you , when I got upstairs . He 's a clever fellow . I believe in God , as you know , but I must say when it comes to an argument , poor old Ted does seem a bit weak , with his : ' We 're told this , ' and ' We 're told that : Nobody mentioned Nollie . I must have the whole thing out with Ted ; we must know how to act when it 's all over . "
61762	61772	61724	61724	Edward	122	" I 've never asked your forgiveness , Bob . "
61801	61807	61773	61773	Robert	123	" My dear old chap ! "
61808	61819	61773	61773	Robert	123	" It has been very difficult to speak of this . "
61820	61827	61773	61773	Robert	123	" Of course , of course ! "
61874	61896	61866	61866	Edward	122	" It still seems to me incredible . Day and night I think of what it 's my duty to do . "
61897	61900	61902	61902	Robert	123	" Nothing ! "
61904	61942	61902	61902	Robert	123	" Leave the baby with Thirza ; we 'll take care of it , and when Nollie 's fit , let her go back to work in a hospital again . She 'll soon get over it . "
61979	62001	61973	61973	Edward	122	" That is very sweet of you both , but it would be wrong and cowardly for me to allow it . "
62021	62045	62055	62055	his	122	" Dash it all , my dear Ted , that 's for Nollie to say . She 's a woman now , remember . "
62060	62081	62082	62082	He	122	" A woman ? Little Nollie ! Bob , I 've made a terrible mess of it with my girls . "
62105	62169	62170	62170	He	123	" Oh ! Hang it , old boy , I do n't think that . What else could you have done ? You take too much on yourself . After all , they 're fine girls . I 'm sure Nollie 's a darling . It 's these modern notions , and this war . Cheer up ! It 'll all dry straight . "
62192	62197	62198	62198	he	122	" Nothing comes straight , "
62201	62213	62198	62198	he	122	" unless it 's faced ; you know that , Bob . "
62254	62262	62263	62263	he	123	" Something in that , of course , "
62267	62309	62263	62263	he	123	" All the same , the decision 's with Nollie . We 'll see what Thirza says . Anyway , there 's no hurry . It 's a thousand pities you 're a parson ; the trouble 's enough without that : "
62315	62360	62312	62312	his	122	" My position is nothing ; it 's the thought of my child , my wife 's child . It 's sheer pride ; and I ca n't subdue it . I ca n't fight it down . God forgive me , I rebel . "
62407	62417	62420	62421	his brother	327	" I 'm not a man of the world , "
62424	62479	62420	62421	his brother	327	" I 'm out of touch with many things . It 's almost unbearable to me to feel that I 'm joining with the world to condemn my own daughter ; not for their reasons , perhaps - I do n't know ; I hope not , but still , I 'm against her . "
62485	62491	62492	62492	he	123	" Steady , old man ! "
62495	62559	62560	62560	He	123	" It 's a misfortune . But if I were you I should feel : ' She 's done a wild , silly thing , but , hang it , if anybody says a word against her , I 'll wring his neck . ' And what 's more , you 'll feel much the same , when it comes to the point . "
62594	62686	62560	62560	He	123	" I do n't know ; I 've tried to see clearly . I have prayed to be shown what her duty is , and mine . It seems to me there can be no peace for her until she has atoned , by open suffering ; that the world 's judgment is her cross , and she must bear it ; especially in these days , when all the world is facing suffering so nobly . And then it seems so hard - so bitter ; my poor little Nollie ! "
62707	62823	62703	62703	he	123	" I do n't follow you , Ted ; no , I do n't . I think a man should screen his children all he can . Talk to her as you like , but do n't let the world do it . Dash it , the world 's a rotten gabbling place . I call myself a man of the world , but when it comes to private matters - well , then I draw the line . It seems to me it seems to me inhuman . What does George Laird think about it ? He 's a knowing chap . I suppose you 've - no , I suppose you have n't - "
62835	62838	62839	62839	he	122	" No , "
62842	62852	62839	62839	he	122	" I should hardly ask George Laird 's opinion . "
63026	63032	63033	63033	he	122	" It seems to me , "
63038	63051	63033	63033	he	122	" that the chicken had better be hatched before we count it . "

63220	63224	63205	63205	Noel	197	" MY DEAREST NOLLIE ,
63225	63480	63205	63205	Noel	197	" Now that you are strong again , I feel that I must put before you my feeling as to your duty in this crisis of your life . Your aunt and uncle have made the most kind and generous offer to adopt your little boy . I have known that this was in their minds for some time , and have thought it over day and night for weeks . In the worldly sense it would be the best thing , no doubt . But this is a spiritual matter . The future of our souls depends on how we meet the consequences of our conduct . And painful , dreadful , indeed , as they must be , I am driven to feel that you can only reach true peace by facing them in a spirit of brave humility . I want you to think and think - till you arrive at a certainty which satisfies your conscience . If you decide , as I trust you will , to come back to me here with your boy , I shall do all in my power to make you happy while we face the future together . To do as your aunt and uncle in their kindness wish , would , I am sore afraid , end in depriving you of the inner strength and happiness which God only gives to those who do their duty and try courageously to repair their errors . I have confidence in you , my dear child .
63481	63487	63205	63205	Noel	197	" Ever your most loving father ,
63488	63492	63493	63493	She	1804	" EDWARD PIERSON . "
63752	63776	63724	63725	her aunt	695	" To please me , Nollie , now that you 're going , just for the foolish , who know nothing about you . "
63983	63991	63992	63992	she	127	" I 've been looking at him , "
63996	64009	63992	63992	she	127	" he 's like you , Nollie , except for his nose . "
64010	64031	64032	64032	She	127	" He 's hardly got one yet . But are n't his eyes intelligent ? I think they 're wonderful . "
64038	64048	64032	64032	She	127	" What shall I do about this , Gratian ? "
64052	64080	64049	64049	Gratian	127	" Wear it . I do n't see why outsiders should know . For the sake of Dad I think you ought . There 's the parish . "
64091	64095	64081	64081	Noel	197	" Would you ? "
64096	64107	63992	63992	she	127	" I ca n't tell . I think I would . "
64112	64133	64108	64108	Noel	197	" I 'm going to get cynical ; I can feel it in my bones . How is Daddy looking ? "
64134	64158	64081	64081	Noel	197	" Very thin ; Mr. Lauder is back again from the Front for a bit , and taking some of the work now . "
64159	64168	64108	64108	Noel	197	" Do I hurt him very much still ? "
64169	64190	64081	64081	Noel	197	" He 's awfully pleased that you 've come . He 's as sweet as he can be about you . "
64191	64194	64196	64196	Noel	197	" Yes , "
64198	64221	64196	64196	Noel	197	" that 's what 's dreadful . I 'm glad he was n't in when I came . Has he told anyone ? "
64227	64252	64222	64222	Gratian	127	" I do n't think anybody knows ; unless - perhaps Captain Fort . He came in again the other night ; and somehow - "
64256	64259	64260	64260	she	127	" Leila ! "
64264	64270	64260	64260	she	127	" Have you seen her ? "
64271	64286	64310	64310	Gratian	127	" I went to her flat last week with Dad - he likes her . "
64287	64309	64260	64260	she	127	" Delilah is her real name , you know . All men like her . And Captain Fort is her lover . "
64328	64334	64337	64337	Noel	197	" Of course he is , "
64343	64367	64337	64337	Noel	197	" She has no men friends ; her sort never have , only lovers . Why do you think he knows about me ? "
64368	64377	64260	64260	she	127	" When he asked after you he looked - "
64378	64407	64337	64337	Noel	197	" Yes ; I 've seen him look like that when he 's sorry for anything . I do n't care . Has Monsieur Lavendie been in lately ? "
64408	64416	64260	64260	she	127	" Yes ; he looks awfully unhappy . "
64417	64422	64337	64337	Noel	197	" His wife drugs . "
64423	64433	64260	64260	she	127	" Oh , Nollie ! How do you know ? "
64434	64483	64337	64337	Noel	197	" I saw her once ; I 'm sure she does ; there was a smell ; and she 's got wandering eyes that go all glassy . He can paint me now , if he likes . I would n't let him before . Does he know ? "
64484	64489	64260	64260	she	127	" Of course not . "
64490	64521	64337	64337	Noel	197	" He knows there was something ; he 's got second sight , I think . But I mind him less than anybody . Is his picture of Daddy good ? "
64522	64531	64260	64260	she	127	" Powerful , but it hurts , somehow . "
64532	64541	64337	64337	Noel	197	" Let 's go down and see it . "
64628	64637	64639	64639	Gratian	127	" It 's the face of that girl , "
64654	64657	64659	64659	Noel	197	" No , "
64661	64670	64659	64659	Noel	197	" it 's the look in his eyes . "
64671	64704	64757	64757	Gratian	127	" But why did he choose such a horrid , common girl ? Is n't she fearfully alive , though ? She looks as if she were saying : ' Cheerio ! ' "
64705	64720	64659	64659	Noel	197	" She is ; it 's awfully pathetic , I think . Poor Daddy ! "
64721	64727	64729	64729	Gratian	127	" It 's a libel , "
64732	64756	64659	64659	Noel	197	" No . That 's what hurts . He is n't quite - quite all there . Will he be coming in soon ? "
64767	64783	64757	64757	Gratian	127	" Would you like me at dinner or not ; I can easily be out ? "
64789	64822	64784	64784	Noel	197	" It 's no good to funk it . He wanted me , and now he 's got me . Oh ! why did he ? It 'll be awful for him . "
64826	64882	64823	64823	Gratian	127	" I 've tried my best , but he always said : ' I 've thought so long about it all that I ca n't think any longer . I can only feel the braver course is the best . When things are bravely and humbly met , there will be charity and forgiveness . ' "
64883	64888	64890	64890	Noel	197	" There wo n't , "
64892	64904	64890	64890	Noel	197	" Daddy 's a saint , and he does n't see . "
64905	64940	64823	64823	Gratian	127	" Yes , he is a saint . But one must think for oneself - one simply must . I ca n't believe as he does , any more ; can you , Nollie ? "
64941	64983	64890	64890	Noel	197	" I do n't know . When I was going through it , I prayed ; but I do n't know whether I really believed . I do n't think I mind much about that , one way or the other . "
64984	64989	64991	64991	Gratian	127	" I mind terribly , "
64993	64999	64991	64991	Gratian	127	" I want the truth . "
65000	65009	65011	65011	Noel	197	" I do n't know what I want , "
65014	65025	65011	65011	Noel	197	" except that sometimes I want - life ; awfully . "
65114	65146	65172	65172	she	1837	" He 's sleeping beautiful - the lamb . I 'll go down and get a cup o ' tea , and come up , ma'am , when the gong goes . "
65255	65257	65232	65232	she	1837	" her "
65271	65277	65265	65265	She	1837	" cup o ' tea , "
65964	65978	65961	65961	he	122	" You will let me paint you now , mademoiselle , I hope ? "
66079	66087	66072	66072	She	127	" I mind him less than anybody . "
66100	66113	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" I have not seen you for a long time , mademoiselle , "
66150	66166	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" I 've been away . How are you going to paint me , monsieur ? "
66167	66188	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" In that dress , mademoiselle ; Just as you are now , warming yourself at the fire of life . "
66189	66196	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" But it is n't there . "
66197	66219	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" Yes , fires soon go out . Mademoiselle , will you come and see my wife ? She is ill . "
66220	66223	66225	66225	Noel	197	" Now ? "
66229	66273	66115	66116	the painter	1461	" Yes , now . She is really ill , and I have no one there . That is what I came to ask of your sister ; but - now you are here , it 's even better . She likes you . "
66278	66283	66284	66284	she	1884	" Wait one minute ! "
66333	66344	66345	66345	he	1461	" I do not know if I am to blame , "
66348	66373	66345	66345	he	1461	" my wife has been no real wife to me since she knew I had a mistress and was no real husband to her . "
66387	66390	66391	66391	he	1461	" Yes , "
66395	66568	66391	66391	he	1461	" from that has come her tragedy . But she should have known before I married her . Nothing was concealed . Bon Dieu ! she should have known ! Why can not a woman see things as they are ? My mistress , mademoiselle , is not a thing of flesh . It is my art . It has always been first with me , and always will . She has never accepted that , she is incapable of accepting it . I am sorry for her . But what would you ? I was a fool to marry her . Chere mademoiselle , no troubles are anything beside the trouble which goes on day and night , meal after meal , year , after year , between two people who should never have married , because one loves too much and requires all , and the other loves not at all - no , not at all , now , it is long dead - and can give but little . "
66569	66575	66577	66577	Noel	197	" Ca n't you separate ? "
66581	66688	66391	66391	he	1461	" It is hard to separate from one who craves for you as she craves her drugs - yes , she takes drugs now , mademoiselle . It is impossible for one who has any compassion in his soul . Besides , what would she do ? We live from hand to mouth , in a strange land . She has no friends here , not one . How could I leave her while this war lasts ? As well could two persons on a desert island separate . She is killing herself , too , with these drugs , and I can not stop her . "
66689	66693	66695	66695	Noel	197	" Poor madame ! "
66697	66701	66695	66695	Noel	197	" Poor monsieur ! "
66711	66719	66720	66720	he	1461	" I can not change my nature , "
66727	66788	66720	66720	he	1461	" nor she hers . So we go on . But life will stop suddenly some day for one of us . After all , it is much worse for her than for me . Enter , mademoiselle . Do not tell her I am going to paint you ; she likes you , because you refused to let me . "
66937	66945	66947	66948	the painter	1461	" Ah , Barra ! You here ! "
66950	66987	66947	66948	the painter	1461	" Mademoiselle , this is Monsieur Barra , a friend of ours from the front ; and this is our landlady 's little girl . A little refugee , too , are n't you , Chica ? "
67028	67034	67036	67036	Lavendie	221	" Sit down , mademoiselle , "
67044	67052	67036	67036	Lavendie	221	" I will bring my wife in , "
67186	67192	67193	67193	she	1906	" How do you do ? "
67198	67246	67193	67193	she	1906	" So Pierre brought you , to see me again . I remember you so well . You would not let him paint you . Ah ! que c'est drole ! You are so pretty , too . Hein , Monsieur Barra , is not mademoiselle pretty ? "
67262	67265	67267	67267	Lavendie	221	" Henriette , "
67288	67288	67285	67285	I	0	"
67289	67299	67301	67301	Noel	197	" I 'm so sorry you 're not well , "
67342	67354	67355	67355	she	618	" A great painter , my husband , is he not ? "
67360	67400	67355	67355	she	618	" You would not imagine what that man can do . And how he paints - all day long ; and all night in his head . And so you would not let him paint you , after all ? "
67405	67414	67401	67401	Lavendie	221	" Voyons , Henriette , causez d'autre chose . "
67440	67534	67415	67416	His wife	618	" I am a prisoner here , mademoiselle , I never leave the house . Here I live day after day - my husband is always painting . Who would go out alone under this grey sky of yours , and the hatreds of the war in every face ? I prefer to keep my room . My husband goes painting ; every face he sees interests him , except that which he sees every day . But I am a prisoner . Monsieur Barra is our first visitor for a long time . "
67544	67559	67538	67538	his	583	" Prisonnier , madame ! What would you say if you were out there ? "
67567	67615	67561	67561	he	583	" We are the prisoners , we others . What would you say to imprisonment by explosion day and night ; never a minute free . Bom ! Bom ! Bom ! Ah ! les tranchees ! It 's not so free as all that , there . "
67616	67624	67626	67626	Lavendie	221	" Every one has his own prison , "
67629	67662	67626	67626	Lavendie	221	" Mademoiselle even , has her prison - and little Chica , and her doll . Every one has his prison , Barra . Monsieur Barra is also a painter , mademoiselle . "
67663	67666	67668	67668	Barra	245	" Moi ! "
67676	67745	67746	67746	He	245	" I paint puddles , star - bombs , horses ' ribs - I paint holes and holes and holes , wire and wire and wire , and water - long white ugly water . I paint splinters , and men 's souls naked , and men 's bodies dead , and nightmare - nightmare - all day and all night - I paint them in my head . "
67767	67779	67780	67780	he	245	" And their souls as white as snow , les camarades , "
67786	67808	67780	67780	he	245	" millions of Belgians , English , French , even the Boches , with white souls . I paint those souls ! "
67823	67826	67827	67827	he	245	" Barra , "
67838	67888	67827	67827	he	245	" is a great painter , but the Front has turned his head a little . What he says is true , though . There is no hatred out there . It is here that we are prisoners of hatred , mademoiselle ; avoid hatreds - they are poison ! "
67902	67909	67910	67910	she	618	" Why should we not hate ? "
67913	67984	67910	67910	she	618	" Who killed Chica 's father , and blew her home to - rags ? Who threw her out into this horrible England - pardon , mademoiselle , but it is horrible . Ah ! les Boches ! If my hatred could destroy them there would not be one left . Even my husband was not so mad about his painting when we lived at home . But here - ! "
68016	68024	68025	68025	She	618	" It is mania , your painting ! "
68033	68048	68025	68025	She	618	" Will you have some tea , mademoiselle ? Monsieur Barra , some tea ? "
68054	68090	68049	68050	The soldier	583	" No , madame ; in the trenches we have tea enough . It consoles us . But when we get away - give us wine , le bon vin ; le bon petit vin ! "
68091	68098	68049	68050	The soldier	583	" Get some wine , Pierre ! "
68131	68139	68126	68126	She	618	" I must be going , madame . "
68149	68189	68146	68146	her	618	" Wait a little , mademoiselle . We shall have some wine , and Pierre shall take you back presently . You can not go home alone - you are too pretty . Is she not , Monsieur Barra ? "
68195	68201	68202	68202	he	583	" What would you say , "
68205	68300	68202	68202	he	583	" to bottles of wine bursting in the air , bursting red and bursting white , all day long , all night long ? Great steel bottles , large as Chica : bits of bottles , carrying off men 's heads ? Bsum , garra - a - a , and a house comes down , and little bits of people ever so small , ever so small , tiny bits in the air and all over the ground . Great souls out there , madame . But I will tell you a secret , "
68309	68352	68353	68353	he	583	" all a little , little mad ; nothing to speak of - just a little bit mad ; like a watch , you know , that you can wind for ever . That is the discovery of this war , mademoiselle , "
68363	68378	68353	68353	he	583	" you can not gain a great soul till you are a little mad . "
68394	68405	68406	68406	he	583	" It is that madness I shall paint some day , "
68412	68494	68495	68495	he	583	" lurking in one tiny corner of each soul of all those millions , as it creeps , as it peeps , ever so sudden , ever so little when we all think it has been put to bed , here - there , now - then , when you least think ; in and out like a mouse with bright eyes . Millions of men with white souls , all a little mad . A great subject , I think , "
68518	68530	68500	68500	Noel	197	" How long have you been at the Front , monsieur ? "
68531	68552	68553	68553	he	583	" Two years , mademoiselle . Time to go home and paint , is it not ? But art - ! "
68567	68572	68573	68573	he	583	" A little mad , "
68578	68679	68573	68573	he	583	" I will tell you a story . Once in winter after I had rested a fortnight , I go back to the trenches at night , and I want some earth to fill up a hole in the ground where I was sleeping ; when one has slept in a bed one becomes particular . Well , I scratch it from my parapet , and I come to something funny . I strike my briquet , and there is a Boche 's face all frozen and earthy and dead and greeny - white in the flame from my briquet . "
68680	68685	68553	68553	he	583	" Oh , no ! "
68686	68759	68762	68762	he	1929	" Oh ! but yes , mademoiselle ; true as I sit here . Very useful in the parapet - dead Boche . Once a man like me . But in the morning I could not stand him ; we dug him out and buried him , and filled the hole up with other things . But there I stood in the night , and my face as close to his as this "
68773	68864	68762	68762	he	1929	" We talked of our homes ; he had a soul , that man . ' Il me disait des choses ' , how he had suffered ; and I , too , told him my sufferings . Dear God , we know all ; we shall never know more than we know out there , we others , for we are mad - nothing to speak of , but just a little , little mad . When you see us , mademoiselle , walking the streets , remember that . "
68954	68967	68968	68968	he	1930	" To drink our health , and wish us luck , mademoiselle , "
68980	68987	68971	68971	Noel	197	" I wish you all happiness . "
68988	68994	68995	68997	the two men	1937	" And you , mademoiselle , "
69008	69014	69016	69016	Lavendie	253	" And now , mademoiselle , "
69018	69030	69016	69016	Lavendie	253	" if you must go , I will see you home . "
69110	69171	69100	69101	the painter	1461	" I ought not to have asked you to come , mademoiselle ; I did not know our friend Barra was there . Besides , my wife is not fit to receive a lady ; vous voyez qu'il y a de la manie dans cette pauvre tote . I should not have asked you ; but I was so miserable . "
69172	69175	69177	69177	Noel	197	" Oh ! "
69179	69183	69100	69101	the painter	1461	" I know . "
69184	69367	69100	69101	the painter	1461	" In our home over there she had interests . In this great town she can only nurse her grief against me . Ah ! this war ! It seems to me we are all in the stomach of a great coiling serpent . We lie there , being digested . In a way it is better out there in the trenches ; they are beyond hate , they have attained a height that we have not . It is wonderful how they still can be for going on till they have beaten the Boche ; that is curious and it is very great . Did Barra tell you how , when they come back - all these fighters - they are going to rule , and manage the future of the world ? But it will not be so . They will mix in with life , separate - be scattered , and they will be ruled as they were before . The tongue and the pen will rule them : those who have not seen the war will rule them . "
69368	69371	69374	69374	Noel	197	" Oh ! "
69389	69389	69374	69374	Noel	197	"
69394	69400	69401	69401	he	197	" War makes men simple , "
69404	69466	69401	69401	he	197	" elemental ; life in peace is neither simple nor elemental , it is subtle , full of changing environments , to which man must adapt himself ; the cunning , the astute , the adaptable , will ever rule in times of peace . It is pathetic , the belief of those brave soldiers that the - future is theirs . "
69467	69475	69477	69477	Noel	197	" He said , a strange thing , "
69479	69488	69477	69477	Noel	197	" that they were all a little mad . "
69489	69754	69401	69401	he	197	" He is a man of queer genius - Barra ; you should see some of his earlier pictures . Mad is not quite the word , but something is loosened , is rattling round in them , they have lost proportion , they are being forced in one direction . I tell you , mademoiselle , this war is one great forcing - house ; every living plant is being made to grow too fast , each quality , each passion ; hate and love , intolerance and lust and avarice , courage and energy ; yes , and self - sacrifice - all are being forced and forced beyond their strength , beyond the natural flow of the sap , forced till there has come a great wild luxuriant crop , and then - Psum ! Presto ! The change comes , and these plants will wither and rot and stink . But we who see Life in forms of Art are the only ones who feel that ; and we are so few . The natural shape of things is lost . There is a mist of blood before all eyes . Men are afraid of being fair . See how we all hate not only our enemies , but those who differ from us . Look at the streets too - see how men and women rush together , how Venus reigns in this forcing - house . Is it not natural that Youth about to die should yearn for pleasure , for love , for union , before death ? "
69772	69775	69776	69776	she	1944	" Yes , "
69779	69839	69840	69840	She	1944	" I know that 's true , because I rushed , myself . I 'd like you to know . We could n't be married - there was n't time . And - he was killed . But his son is alive . That 's why I 've been away so long . I want every one to know . "
69880	69896	69875	69875	he	1461	" My profound respect , mademoiselle , and my great sympathy . And your father ? "
69897	69904	69875	69875	he	1461	" It 's awful for him . "
69910	70052	69905	69906	The painter	1461	" Ah ! mademoiselle , I am not so sure . Perhaps he does not suffer so greatly . Perhaps not even your trouble can hurt him very much . He lives in a world apart . That , I think , is his true tragedy to be alive , and yet not living enough to feel reality . Do you know Anatole France 's description of an old woman : ' Elle vivait , mais si peu . ' Would that not be well said of the Church in these days : ' Elle vivait , mais si peu . ' I see him always like a rather beautiful dark spire in the night - time when you can not see how it is attached to the earth . He does not know , he never will know , Life . "
70059	70101	70053	70053	Noel	197	" What do you mean by Life , monsieur ? I 'm always reading about Life , and people talk of seeing Life ! What is it - where is it ? I never see anything that you could call Life . "
70106	70113	70114	70114	he	1461	" To ' see life ' ! "
70117	70228	70114	70114	he	1461	" Ah ! that is different . To enjoy yourself ! Well , it is my experience that when people are ' seeing life ' as they call it , they are not enjoying themselves . You know when one is very thirsty one drinks and drinks , but the thirst remains all the same . There are places where one can see life as it is called , but the only persons you will see enjoying themselves at such places are a few humdrums like myself , who go there for a talk over a cup of coffee . Perhaps at your age , though , it is different . "
70244	70265	70229	70229	Noel	197	" I want music and dancing and light , and beautiful things and faces ; but I never get them . "
70266	70426	70479	70479	he	1461	" No , there does not exist in this town , or in any other , a place which will give you that . Fox - trots and ragtime and paint and powder and glare and half - drunken young men , and women with red lips you can get them in plenty . But rhythm and beauty and charm never . In Brussels when I was younger I saw much ' life ' as they call it , but not one lovely thing unspoiled ; it was all as ashes in the mouth . Ah ! you may smile , but I know what I am talking of . Happiness never comes when you are looking for it , mademoiselle ; beauty is in Nature and in real art , never in these false silly make believes . There is a place just here where we Belgians go ; would you like to see how true my words are ?
70427	70432	70229	70229	Noel	197	" Oh , yes ! "
70433	70443	70479	70479	he	1461	" Tres - bien ! Let us go in ? "
70622	70630	70632	70633	the painter	1461	" What will you have , mademoiselle ? "
70635	70647	70632	70633	the painter	1461	" It is just nine o'clock ; we must order quickly . "
70648	70658	70599	70601	a small band	1961	" May I have one of those green things ? "
70659	70665	70667	70667	Lavendie	253	" Deux cremes de menthe , "
70726	70739	70740	70740	she	1958	" I wonder if Daddy was ever in a place like this ? "
70753	70763	70740	70740	she	1958	" Is it nice ? It smells of peppermint . "
70764	70774	70776	70776	he	197	" A beautiful colour . Good luck , mademoiselle ! "
70794	70809	70740	70740	she	1958	" It 's nice ; but awfully sticky . May I have a cigarette ? "
70810	70814	70816	70816	Lavendie	253	" Des cigarettes , "
70821	70831	70832	70832	he	197	" Et deux cafes noirs . Now , mademoiselle , "
70839	70872	70832	70832	he	197	" if we imagine that we have drunk a bottle of wine each , we shall have exhausted all the preliminaries of what is called Vice . Amusing , is n't it ? "
70889	70907	70878	70878	His	197	" Do n't be angry , monsieur , it 's all new to me , you see . "
70920	71074	71075	71075	He	1969	" Pardon ! I forget myself . Only , it hurts me to see beauty in a place like this . It does not go well with that tune , and these voices , and these faces . Enjoy yourself , mademoiselle ; drink it all in ! See the way these people look at each other ; what love shines in their eyes ! A pity , too , we can not hear what they are saying . Believe me , their talk is most subtle , tres - spirituel . These young women are ' doing their bit , ' as you call it ; bringing le plaisir to all these who are serving their country . Eat , drink , love , for tomorrow we die . Who cares for the world simple or the world beautiful , in days like these ? The house of the spirit is empty . "
71094	71103	71090	71090	Noel	197	" I 'm ready to go , monsieur . "
71151	71155	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" Through there , "
71165	71207	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" they dance . So it goes . London in war - time ! Well , after all , it is never very different ; no great town is . Did you enjoy your sight of ' life , ' mademoiselle ? "
71208	71226	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" I think one must dance , to be happy . Is that where your friends go ? "
71227	71259	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" Oh , no ! To a room much rougher , and play dominoes , and drink coffee and beer , and talk . They have no money to throw away . "
71260	71268	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" Why did n't you show me ? "
71269	71303	71157	71158	the painter	1461	" Mademoiselle , in that room you might see someone perhaps whom one day you would meet again ; in the place we visited you were safe enough at least I hope so . "
71307	71320	71304	71304	Noel	197	" I suppose it does n't matter now , what I do . "
71359	71367	71368	71368	she	1973	" I was thinking of - something , "
71375	71381	71368	71368	she	1973	" It 's all right . "
71382	71386	71387	71387	Lavendie	253	" Chere mademoiselle ! "
71411	71431	71408	71408	she	1973	" I 'm sorry I was such a fool ; and thank you awfully , monsieur . Good night . "
71432	71472	71408	71408	she	1973	" Good night ; and better dreams . There is a good time coming - Peace and Happiness once more in the world . It will not always be this Forcing - House . Good night , chere mademoiselle ! "
71589	71595	71597	71597	she	1973	" How do you do ? "
71683	71692	71693	71693	he	258	" I have n't seen you for ages , "
71706	71709	71711	71711	Noel	197	" No , "
71713	71724	71711	71711	Noel	197	" How - do you like being at the Front ? "
71725	71728	71729	71729	he	258	" Ah ! "
71732	71737	71729	71729	he	258	" they 're wonderful ! "
71743	71753	71739	71739	his	258	" It 's so nice to see you again . "
71754	71758	71711	71711	Noel	197	" Is it ? "
71771	71786	71711	71711	Noel	197	" I did n't know your sister had a baby . A jolly baby . "
71787	71792	71711	71711	Noel	197	" She has n't . "
71807	71810	71811	71811	he	258	" Oh ! "
71814	71824	71811	71811	he	258	" Is it a protegee - Belgian or something ? "
71825	71835	71841	71841	she	1973	" No , it 's mine ; my own . "
71886	71893	71895	71895	Noel	197	" Do n't look like that , "
71897	71909	71910	71910	She	1973	" Did n't you understand ? It 's mine - mine . "
71917	71925	71910	71910	She	1973	" Look ! There 's no ring . "
71929	71944	71926	71926	He	258	" I say , you ought n't to - you ought n't to - ! "
71945	71948	71980	71980	Lauder	258	" What ? "
71949	71960	71926	71926	He	258	" Joke about - about such things ; ought you ? "
71961	71979	71980	71980	Lauder	258	" One does n't joke if one 's had a baby without being married , you know . "
72028	72041	72008	72008	he	258	" I ca n't - one does n't - it 's not - "
72042	72046	72048	72048	Noel	197	" It is , "
72050	72061	72048	72048	Noel	197	" If you do n't believe me , ask Daddy . "
72089	72093	72086	72086	she	1991	" Do n't ! "
72094	72097	72098	72098	he	258	" You ! "
72101	72106	72098	72098	he	258	" You ! But - "
72126	72134	72135	72135	she	1991	" I do n't want it hidden , "
72141	72158	72160	72160	she	1991	" I want every one to know . It 's stupid as it is - stupid ! "
72165	72181	72160	72160	she	1991	" Ca n't you see how stupid it is - everybody 's mouth falling open ! "

72877	72883	72884	72884	he	197	" I admire your pluck , "
72887	72893	72863	72863	he	197	" I have n't any . "
72894	72926	72863	72863	he	197	" We never know ourselves , do we ? I suppose you would n't walk my pace a minute or two , would you ? I 'm going the same way . "
72927	72938	72863	72863	he	197	" I do n't know which way I 'm going . "
72939	72947	72863	72863	he	197	" That is my case , too . "
72954	72965	72967	72967	Fort	197	" I wish to God I were back in France , "
72970	72978	72967	72967	Fort	197	" One does n't feel clean here . "
73007	73014	73015	73015	she	2012	" Is your leg quite hopeless ? "
73018	73021	72979	72979	Noel	197	" Quite . "
73022	73028	72979	72979	Noel	197	" That must be horrid . "
73029	73066	72979	72979	Noel	197	" Hundreds of thousands would look on it as splendid luck ; and so it is if you count it better to be alive than dead , which I do , in spite of the blues . "
73067	73073	72979	72979	Noel	197	" How is Cousin Leila ? "
73074	73092	73094	73094	he	197	" Very well . She goes on pegging away at the hospital ; she 's a brick . "
73117	73129	73108	73108	he	197	" I must n't keep you crawling along at this pace . "
73130	73138	73108	73108	he	197	" Oh , I do n't mind ! "
73139	73167	73108	73108	he	197	" I only wanted to say that if I can be of any service to you at any time in any way whatever , please command me . "

76894	76950	76795	76795	Leila	208	" No , no ; it 's not merely that he 's sorry . By the way he looks at her , I know I 'm not mistaken . I 've wondered - what do you think , Leila . He 's too old for her ; but he seems an honourable , kind man . "
76951	76961	76972	76972	she	208	" Oh ! a most honourable , kind man . "
77021	77028	77029	77029	she	208	" All this is very interesting , "
77038	77050	77029	77029	she	208	" considering that he 's more than my friend , Edward . "
77107	77138	77104	77104	she	208	" Oh ! I sha n't break my heart ; I 'm a good loser . And I 'm a good fighter , too ; perhaps I sha n't lose . "
77154	77158	77160	77160	Pierson	122	" Forgive me , "
77163	77189	77160	77160	Pierson	122	" I did n't know . I 'm stupid . I thought your love for your poor soldiers had left no room for other feelings . "
77196	77254	77190	77190	Leila	208	" What have they to do with each other ? Did you never hear of passion , Edward ? Oh ! Do n't look at me like that . Do you think a woman ca n't feel passion at my age ? As much as ever , more than ever , because it 's all slipping away . "
77276	77286	77287	77287	she	208	" What has your life been all these years , "
77334	77334	77287	77287	she	208	"
77335	77343	77287	77287	she	208	" And are you happier for that ? "
77344	77354	77287	77287	she	208	" I was ; and I shall be again . "
77363	77367	77368	77368	he	122	" Shall be ? "
77371	77388	77368	77368	he	122	" I hope so . It 's just two ways of looking at things , Leila . "
77389	77415	77416	77416	He	122	" Oh , Edward ! Do n't be so gentle ! I suppose you do n't think a person like me can ever really love ? "
77457	77476	77453	77453	her	208	" I 've not been nice to you . Forgive me , Edward ! I 'm so unhappy . "
77477	77521	77437	77437	he	122	" There was a Greek who used to say : ' God is the helping of man by man . ' It is n't true , but it 's beautiful . Good - bye , dear Leila , and do n't be sorrowful . "
77840	77860	77830	77830	Fort	175	" Time , you old gipsy man Will you not stay Put up your caravan Just for a day ? "

78175	78178	78199	78200	the maid	1694	" change , "

78487	78511	78483	78483	she	208	" I 'm an awful bore to you . Poor Jimmy ! No ! Do n't pretend ! I know what I know ! "
78580	78611	78566	78566	she	208	" I was asleep , dreaming ; dreaming you loved me . Was n't it funny ? Come along . There are oysters , for the last time this season . "
78662	78735	78656	78656	Leila	208	" Do n't you long for the sun , Jimmy ? Could n't we - could n't you go ? Oh ! why does n't this wretched war end ? All that we 've got here at home every scrap of wealth , and comfort , and age , and art , and music , I 'd give it all for the light and the sun out there . Would n't you ? "
79406	79418	79393	79393	He	122	" Do n't you think it 's like me , Daddy ? "
79419	79436	79393	79393	He	122	" It 's like you ; but it hurts me . I ca n't tell why . "
79455	79469	79393	79393	He	122	" It is perhaps the colouring which does not please you , monsieur ? "
79470	79486	79393	79393	He	122	" No , no ; deeper . The expression ; what is she waiting for ? "
79496	79508	79393	79393	He	122	" It is as I see her , monsieur le cure . "
79522	79528	79530	79530	he	122	" She looks ' fey , "
79549	79559	79540	79540	Lavendie	253	" Fey ? What does that mean , mademoiselle ? "
79560	79566	79603	79603	Pierson	122	" Possessed , or something . "
79580	79595	79577	79577	Lavendie	253	" I think there is still a little too much light on that ear . "
79608	79631	79634	79634	her	253	" Nollie , I want you to know something . In all but the name , Captain Fort is a married man . "
79650	79657	79646	79646	She	253	" I know ; to Leila . "
79658	79667	79646	79646	She	253	" Do you mean she has told you ? "
79673	79677	79646	79646	She	253	" Then how ? "
79678	79701	79702	79702	He	122	" I guessed . Daddy , do n't treat me as a child any more . What 's the use , now ? "
79764	79775	79753	79753	she	253	" Oh , Daddy dear ! Oh , Daddy dear ! "
79842	79852	79837	79837	Noel	197	" Would you like me to come to Church ? "
79853	79859	79837	79837	Noel	197	" Of course , Nollie . "
80897	80903	80893	80894	the maid	1694	" Canon Rushbourne , sir , "
80988	81029	81031	81031	he	122	" My dear Edward , how many years it is since we met ! Do you remember dear old Blakeway ? I saw him only yesterday . He 's just the same . I 'm delighted to see you again , "
81070	81081	81082	81082	he	122	" You 've something to say to me , Alec , "
81102	81131	81093	81093	his	267	" Yes ; I wanted to have a little talk with you , Edward . I hope you wo n't mind . I do hope you wo n't . "
81132	81138	81139	81140	Canon Rushbourne	267	" Why should I mind ? "
81156	81194	81195	81195	he	267	" I know you 've every right to say to me : ' Mind your own business . ' But I made up my mind to come as a friend , hoping to save you from - er "
81202	81279	81195	81195	he	267	" I think you ought to know of the feeling in your parish that - er - that - er - your position is very delicate . Without breach of confidence I may tell you that letters have been sent to headquarters ; you can imagine perhaps what I mean . Do believe , my dear friend , that I 'm actuated by my old affection for you ; nothing else , I do assure you . "
81358	81367	81355	81355	Pierson	122	" Thank you , Alec ; I understand . "
81375	81422	81423	81423	He	2222	" You did n't realise how very easily people misinterpret her being here with you ; it seems to them a kind - a kind of challenge . They were bound , I think , to feel that ; and I 'm afraid , in consequence - "
81437	81453	81423	81423	He	2222	" I am to choose , you mean , between my daughter and my parish ? "
81475	81520	81454	81455	The Canon	2222	" My visit is quite informal , my dear fellow ; I ca n't say at all . But there is evidently much feeling ; that is what I wanted you to know . You have n't quite seen , I think , that - "
81526	81534	81521	81521	Pierson	122	" I ca n't talk of this . "
81539	81557	81558	81558	He	122	" Believe me , Edward , I sympathise deeply . I felt I had to warn you . "
81564	81576	81558	81558	He	122	" Good - bye , my dear friend , do forgive me "
81608	81616	81617	81617	he	122	" Coming out from my poor friend , "
81620	81640	81642	81642	he	122	" I ran into a baby 's perambulator and that young mother , whom I remember as a little thing "
81653	81795	81642	81642	he	122	" arranging it for going out . It startled me ; and I fear I asked quite foolishly : ' Is it a boy ? ' The poor young thing looked up at me . She has very large eyes , quite beautiful , strange eyes . ' Have you been speaking to Daddy about me ? ' ' My dear young lady , ' I said , ' I 'm such an old friend , you see . You must forgive me . ' And then she said : ' Are they going to ask him to resign ? ' ' That depends on you , ' I said . Why do I say these things , Charlotte ? I ought simply to have held my tongue . Poor young thing ; so very young ! And the little baby ! "
81796	81806	81807	81808	Mrs. Rushbourne	270	" She has brought it on herself , Alec , "
81846	81855	81842	81844	The old saw	2231	" An Englishman 's house is his castle ! "
82086	82095	82077	82077	One	424	" Stand and deliver me your inmost judgments . "
82210	82220	82196	82196	he	2255	" The heart of another is a dark forest , "
82230	82241	82227	82227	he	2226	" Well , Hodson , what news of your son ? "
82242	82259	82286	82286	he	2226	" Nothing more , Mr. Pierson , thank you , sir , nothing more at present . "
82426	82438	82414	82414	She	2263	" Have you any news of your husband , Mrs. Cherry ? "
82439	82454	82414	82414	She	2263	" No , Mr. Pierson , I ' ave not ; not this week . "
82455	82463	82414	82414	She	2263	" He has n't gone out yet ? "
82464	82476	82414	82414	She	2263	" No , Mr. Pierson ; ' e ' as not . "
82552	82555	82538	82539	the woman	586	" Good morning "
83645	83649	83650	83650	he	156	" Well played ! "
83894	83904	83887	83890	The parlour - maid	2315	" Where are Miss Noel and Nurse , Susan ? "
83905	83930	83887	83890	The parlour - maid	2315	" I did n't know you were in , sir . Miss Noel left me this note to give you . They - I - "
83938	83951	83935	83935	his	125	" Thank you , Susan ; get me some tea , please . "
83987	83990	83974	83974	he	156	" DARLING DADDY ,
83991	84108	83967	83967	His	156	" The man who came this morning told me of what is going to happen . I simply wo n't have it . I 'm sending Nurse and baby down to Kestrel at once , and going to Leila 's for the night , until I 've made up my mind what to do . I knew it was a mistake my coming back . I do n't care what happens to me , but I wo n't have you hurt . I think it 's hateful of people to try and injure you for my fault . I 've had to borrow money from Susan - six pounds . Oh ! Daddy dear , forgive me .
84109	84111	83974	83974	he	156	" Your loving
84112	84115	83967	83967	His	156	" NOLLIE . "
84552	84592	84542	84542	Blake	277	" And we are put on earth a little space , That we may learn to bear the beams of love ; And these black bodies and this sunburnt face Are but a cloud , and like a shady grove .
84593	84638	84542	84542	Blake	277	" For when our souls have learned the heat to bear , The cloud will vanish , we shall hear His voice , Saying : Come out from the grove , my love and care , And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice ! "
84805	84823	84824	84824	He	2316	" Thank you kindly , sir ; I 'll go home now . Come on , Dick ! "
84915	84929	84906	84906	she	208	" Why did you come , Daddy ? It was much better not . "
84930	84936	84906	84906	she	208	" Are you alone here ? "
84937	84959	84906	84906	she	208	" Yes ; Leila gave me her key . She has to be at the hospital till ten to - night . "
84960	84971	84906	84906	she	208	" You must come home with me , my dear . "
85004	85009	85010	85010	he	197	" Come , Nollie , "
85013	85026	85010	85010	he	197	" do n't be unreasonable . We must see this through together . "
85027	85030	84992	84992	he	197	" No . "
85031	85064	85010	85010	he	197	" My dear , that 's childish . Do you think the mere accident of your being or not being at home can affect my decision as to what my duty is ? "
85065	85092	84992	84992	he	197	" Yes ; it 's my being there that matters . Those people do n't care , so long as it is n't an open scandal . "
85093	85096	85010	85010	he	197	" Nollie ! "
85097	85142	84992	84992	he	197	" But it is so , Daddy . Of course it 's so , and you know it . If I 'm away they 'll just pity you for having a bad daughter . And quite right too . I am a bad daughter . "
85146	85155	85143	85143	Pierson	125	" Just like when you were a tiny . "
85156	85193	85010	85010	he	197	" I wish I were a tiny again , or ten years older . It 's this half age - But I 'm not coming back with you , Daddy ; so it 's no good . "
85200	85210	85211	85211	he	125	" I 've been thinking this over all day , "
85215	85283	85211	85211	he	125	" Perhaps in my pride I made a mistake when I first knew of your trouble . Perhaps I ought to have accepted the consequences of my failure , then , and have given up , and taken you away at once . After all , if a man is not fit to have the care of souls , he should have the grace to know it . "
85284	85290	85292	85292	Noel	197	" But you are fit , "
85295	85302	85292	85292	Noel	197	" Daddy , you are fit ! "
85303	85328	85211	85211	he	125	" I 'm afraid not . There is something wanting in me , I do n't know exactly what ; but something very wanting . "
85329	85347	85292	85292	Noel	197	" There is n't . It 's only that you 're too good - that 's why ! "
85353	85359	85350	85350	his	125	" Do n't , Nollie ! "
85360	85364	85366	85366	Noel	197	" I will , "
85368	85460	85366	85366	Noel	197	" You 're too gentle , and you 're too good . You 're charitable , and you 're simple , and you believe in another world ; that 's what 's the matter with you , Daddy . Do you think they do , those people who want to chase us out ? They do n't even begin to believe , whatever they say or think . I hate them , and sometimes I hate the Church ; either it 's hard and narrow , or else it 's worldly . "
85498	85504	85505	85505	he	384	" You 're talking wildly , "
85514	85529	85509	85509	his	384	" You must n't say things like that ; they 're blasphemous and wicked . "
85553	85619	85548	85548	she	2349	" You 've slaved for those people years and years , and you 've had no pleasure and you 've had no love ; and they would n't care that if you broke your heart . They do n't care for anything , so long as it all seems proper . Daddy , if you let them hurt you , I wo n't forgive you ! "
85620	85631	85548	85548	she	2349	" And what if you hurt me now , Nollie ? "
85641	85667	85632	85632	Noel	197	" Oh , no ! Oh , no ! I do n't - I wo n't . Not again . I 've done that already . "
85668	85701	85548	85548	she	2349	" Very well , my dear ! then come home with me , and we 'll see what 's best to be done . It ca n't be settled by running away . "
85707	85781	85702	85702	Noel	197	" No . Twice I 've done what you wanted , and it 's been a mistake . If I had n't gone to Church on Sunday to please you , perhaps it would never have come to this . You do n't see things , Daddy . I could tell , though I was sitting right in front . I knew what their faces were like , and what they were thinking . "
85782	85794	85632	85632	Noel	197	" One must do right , Nollie , and not mind . "
85795	85820	85702	85702	Noel	197	" Yes ; but what is right ? It 's not right for me to hurt you , and I 'm not going to . "
85836	85846	85632	85632	Noel	197	" What are you going to do , then ? "
85847	85873	85702	85702	Noel	197	" I suppose I shall go to Kestrel to - morrow . Auntie will have me , I know ; I shall talk to Leila . "
85874	85885	85632	85632	Noel	197	" Whatever you do , promise to let me know . "
85889	85909	85910	85910	She	2351	" Daddy , you - look awfully , awfully tired . I 'm going to give you some medicine . "
85958	85966	85910	85910	She	2351	" What are you doing , Nollie ? "
85989	86005	85967	85967	Noel	197	" You 're to take this ; and I 'm going to have some myself . "
86006	86010	86012	86012	Pierson	125	" My dear , "
86015	86021	86012	86012	Pierson	125	" it 's not yours . "
86022	86072	86074	86074	she	2352	" Drink it ; Daddy ! Do n't you know that Leila would never forgive me if I let you go home looking like that . Besides , she told me I was to eat . Drink it . You can send her a nice present . Drink it ! "
86128	86188	86119	86119	she	2352	" There , you look better already . Now you 're to go home at once , in a cab if you can get one ; and tell Gratian to make you feed up , or you wo n't have a body at all ; you ca n't do your duty if you have n't one , you know . "
86204	86235	86197	86197	Noel	197	" You 're my child to - night , and I 'm going to send you to bed . Do n't worry , Daddy ; it 'll all come right . "
86597	86606	86592	86592	She	2364	" There is a Tavern in the Town , "

86729	86743	86723	86724	a man	3326	" I 'm awfully sorry . It 's only I , Jimmy Fort . "
86748	86765	86744	86744	Noel	197	" Leila is n't in ; but she will be directly - it 's past ten . "
86779	86796	86766	86766	He	197	" Wo n't you sit down ? Oh ! and wo n't you have a cigarette ? "
86797	86800	86766	86766	He	197	" Thanks . "
86826	86832	86833	86833	she	2364	" I 'm going now , "
86836	86850	86833	86833	she	2364	" Would you mind telling Leila that I found I could n't stop ? "
86878	86891	86870	86870	him	197	" Noel - if you do n't mind me calling you that ? "
86892	86897	86926	86926	he	197	" Not a bit . "
86898	86908	86870	86870	him	197	" Do n't go ; I 'm going myself . "
86909	86918	86919	86919	She	2364	" Oh , no ! Not for worlds . "
86933	86940	86870	86870	him	197	" Please ; just one minute ! "
86961	86972	86957	86957	He	197	" Do you mind telling me why you came here ? "
86973	86981	86957	86957	He	197	" Oh , just to see Leila . "
86982	86996	86957	86957	He	197	" Things have come to a head at home , have n't they ? "
87002	87012	86957	86957	He	197	" You came for refuge , did n't you ? "
87013	87017	86957	86957	He	197	" From whom ? "
87018	87032	86957	86957	He	197	" Do n't be angry ; from the need of hurting your father . "
87036	87052	86957	86957	He	197	" I knew it would come to that . What are you going to do ? "
87053	87057	87058	87058	She	2364	" Enjoy myself . "
87069	87101	87065	87065	she	2364	" That 's absurd . Do n't be angry ! You 're quite right . Only , you must begin at the right end , must n't you ? Sit down ! "
87109	87117	87065	87065	she	2364	" No ; sit down , please . "
87149	87159	87160	87160	she	2364	" It 's awfully funny , is n't it ? "
87163	87166	87167	87167	he	197	" Funny ? "
87171	87181	87167	87167	he	197	" Most things are , in this funny world . "
87231	87237	87238	87238	he	197	" If I go now , "
87241	87254	87238	87238	he	197	" will you promise me to stop till you 've seen Leila ? "
87255	87258	87269	87269	Noel	197	" No . "
87259	87268	87238	87238	he	197	" That 's foolish . Come , promise ! "
87283	87306	87269	87269	Noel	197	" Leila 's lucky , is n't she ? No children , no husband , no father , no anything . Lovely ! "
87321	87325	87326	87326	he	197	" Poor Leila ! "
87329	87346	87307	87307	She	2364	" Why are you sorry for her ? She has freedom ! And she has you ! "
87360	87369	87385	87385	She	2364	" You need n't envy her for that . "
87393	87416	87385	87385	She	2364	" Oh , here you are , Leila ! Father 's been here , and we 've had some of your champagne ! "
87417	87426	87385	87385	She	2364	" Capital ! You are in the dark ! "
87544	87587	87541	87541	Leila	208	" I did n't expect you , Jimmy ; I 'm glad you have n't been dull . Noel is staying here to - night . Give me a cigarette . Sit down , both of you . I 'm awfully tired ! "
87639	87674	87627	87627	his	175	" Give Noel one , too , and draw the curtains , Jimmy . Quick ! Not that it makes any difference ; it 's as light as day . Sit down , dear . "
87680	87697	87676	87676	Noel	197	" What have you been talking of ? Love and Chinese lanterns , or only me ? "
87760	87775	87754	87754	He	197	" I do n't exactly know ; we had hardly begun , had we ? "
87776	87782	87784	87784	Leila	208	" The night is young , "
87786	87797	87784	87784	Leila	208	" Go on while I just take off my things . "
87887	87892	87894	87894	Noel	197	" Go to her ; "
87910	87910	87906	87906	she	2381	"
87956	87961	87948	87948	she	208	" Anywhere ! Piccadilly ! "
88133	88135	88136	88137	her father	384	" Fey "
88276	88301	88273	88273	his	384	" For better , for worse , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , till death do you part . "
88351	88379	88346	88346	Chica	246	" All mad , mademoiselle , a little mad . Millions of men with white souls , but all a little tiny bit mad , you know . "
88577	88580	88581	88581	he	2405	" Hallo ! "
88584	88590	88581	88581	he	2405	" Come in and dance ! "
88762	88764	88728	88728	she	208	" fey "
89718	89726	89711	89711	Noel	197	" Oh ! What 's the matter ? "
89752	89791	89881	89881	Noel	197	" I'ad a baby . It 's dead .... its father 's dead in France .... I was goin' in the water , but I did n't like the look of it , and now I never will . "
89793	89799	89801	89801	Noel	197	" Now I never will , "
89821	89826	89804	89804	She	208	" Do n't cry ! "
89827	89857	89894	89894	she	208	" It was my first . I 'm thirty - eight . I 'll never ' ave another . Oh ! Why did n't I go in the water ? "
89913	89926	89927	89927	she	208	" The father of my baby was killed in France , too , "
89941	89954	89894	89894	she	208	" Was ' e ? ' Ave you got your baby still ? "
89955	89962	89894	89894	she	208	" Yes , oh , yes ! "
89963	89993	89894	89894	she	208	" I 'm glad of that . It ' urts so bad , it does . I 'd rather lose me ' usband than me baby , any day . "
90015	90024	90025	90025	Noel	197	" Can I do anything to help you ? "
90028	90053	90068	90068	she	208	" No , thank you , miss . I 'm goin' ' ome now . I do n't live far . Thank you kindly . "
90326	90333	90336	90338	the old fellow	2462	" How many to - day ? "
90348	90353	90342	90345	the little cropped man	2466	" Hundred and fourteen . "
90395	90399	90429	90429	him	2458	" Hundred and fourteen "
90798	90801	90784	90786	The three soldiers	2479	" women , "
90802	90806	90784	90786	The three soldiers	2479	" under control , "
90807	90811	90849	90849	they	2479	" perfect plague , "
90855	90858	90849	90849	they	2479	" women . "
90921	90931	90913	90913	He	2483	" Will you have the window up or down ? "
91402	91448	91399	91399	George	140	" Nollie ! Splendid . I 've got an hour . Let 's get out of this cemetery . We 'll have time for a good stretch on the tops . Jolly of you to have come to me . Tell us all about it . "
91460	91503	91454	91454	he	140	" I knew it would n't do . Your Dad forgot that he 's a public figure , and must expect to be damned accordingly . But though you 've cut and run , he 'll resign all the same , Nollie . "
91504	91509	91511	91511	Noel	197	" Oh , no ! "
91518	91540	91454	91454	he	140	" Yes , he 'll resign , you 'll see , he 's got no worldly sense ; not a grain . "
91541	91558	91454	91454	he	140	" Then I shall have spoiled his life , just as if - oh , no ! "
91559	91573	91454	91454	he	140	" Let 's sit down here . I must be back at eleven . "
91604	91610	91612	91612	Noel	197	" Why should he resign , "
91615	91630	91612	91612	Noel	197	" now that I 've gone ? He 'll be lost without it all . "
91634	91666	91631	91631	George	140	" Found , my dear . He 'll be where he ought to be , Nollie , where the Church is , and the Churchmen are not - in the air ! "
91667	91671	91673	91673	Noel	197	" Do n't ! "
91676	91770	91631	91631	George	140	" No , no , I 'm not chaffing . There 's no room on earth for saints in authority . There 's use for a saintly symbol , even if one does n't hold with it , but there 's no mortal use for those who try to have things both ways - to be saints and seers of visions , and yet to come the practical and worldly and rule ordinary men 's lives . Saintly example yes ; but not saintly governance . You 've been his deliverance , Nollie . "
91771	91778	91631	91631	George	140	" But Daddy loves his Church . "
91782	91889	91779	91779	George	140	" Of course , it 'll be a wrench . A man 's bound to have a cosey feeling about a place where he 's been boss so long ; and there is something about a Church - the drone , the scent , the half darkness ; there 's beauty in it , it 's a pleasant drug . But he 's not being asked to give up the drug habit ; only to stop administering drugs to others . Do n't worry , Nollie ; I do n't believe that 's ever suited him , it wants a thicker skin than he 's got . "
91890	91898	91631	91631	George	140	" But all the people he helps ? "
91899	91913	91779	91779	George	140	" No reason he should n't go on helping people , is there ? "
91914	91931	91631	91631	George	140	" But to go on living there , without - Mother died there , you know ! "
91935	92032	91932	91932	George	140	" Dreams , Nollie , all round him ; of the past and the future , of what people are and what he can do with them . I never see him without a skirmish , as you know , and yet I 'm fond of him . But I should be twice as fond , and half as likely to skirmish , if he 'd drop the habits of authority . Then I believe he 'd have some real influence over me ; there 's something beautiful about him , I know that quite well . "
92033	92036	92038	92038	Noel	197	" Yes , "
92041	92049	92051	92051	George	140	" He 's such a queer mixture , "
92053	92255	92051	92051	George	140	" Clean out of his age ; chalks above most of the parsons in a spiritual sense and chalks below most of them in the worldly . And yet I believe he 's in the right of it . The Church ought to be a forlorn hope , Nollie ; then we should believe in it . Instead of that , it 's a sort of business that no one can take too seriously . You see , the Church spiritual ca n't make good in this age - has no chance of making good , and so in the main it 's given it up for vested interests and social influence . Your father is a symbol of what the Church is not . But what about you , my dear ? There 's a room at my boarding - house , and only one old lady besides myself , who knits all the time . If Grace can get shifted we 'll find a house , and you can have the baby . They 'll send your luggage on from Paddington if you write ; and in the meantime Gracie 's got some things here that you can have . "
92256	92267	91932	91932	George	140	" I 'll have to send a wire to Daddy . "
92268	92301	92051	92051	George	140	" I 'll do that . You come to my diggings at half past one , and I 'll settle you in . Until then , you 'd better stay up here . "
92997	93003	92985	92985	He	2512	" Mademoiselle has deserted me ? "
93004	93017	92985	92985	He	2512	" I 'm afraid we shall all desert you soon , monsieur . "
93018	93023	92985	92985	He	2512	" You are going ? "
93024	93039	92985	92985	He	2512	" Yes , I am leaving here . I hope to go to France . "
93040	93044	92985	92985	He	2512	" And mademoiselle ? "
93045	93059	92985	92985	He	2512	" She is at the sea with my son - in - law . "
93089	93093	93094	93094	he	1461	" Mon dieu ! "
93097	93110	93094	93094	he	1461	" Is this not a calamity for you , monsieur le cure ? "
93133	93138	93140	93147	the painter , on whom nothing was lost	2535	" Ah , monsieur ! "
93149	93235	93140	93147	the painter , on whom nothing was lost	2535	" Comme je suis egoiste ! I show my feelings ; it is deplorable . My disappointment must seem a bagatelle to you , who will be so distressed at leaving your old home . This must be a time of great trouble . Believe me ; I understand . But to sympathise with a grief which is not shown would be an impertinence , would it not ? You English gentlefolk do not let us share your griefs ; you keep them to yourselves . "
93239	93242	93243	93243	he	1461	" True , "
93246	93250	93243	93243	he	1461	" Quite true ! "
93251	93322	93342	93342	Lavendie	253	" I am no judge of Christianity , monsieur , but for us artists the doors of the human heart stand open , our own and others . I suppose we have no pride - c'est tres - indelicat . Tell me , monsieur , you would not think it worthy of you to speak to me of your troubles , would you , as I have spoken of mine ? "
93330	93339	93342	93342	Lavendie	253	" You preach of universal charity and love , "
93344	93461	93342	93342	Lavendie	253	" but how can there be that when you teach also secretly the keeping of your troubles to yourselves ? Man responds to example , not to teaching ; you set the example of the stranger , not the brother . You expect from others what you do not give . Frankly , monsieur , do you not feel that with every revelation of your soul and feelings , virtue goes out of you ? And I will tell you why , if you will not think it an offence . In opening your hearts you feel that you lose authority . You are officers , and must never forget that . Is it not so ? "
93466	93513	93462	93462	Pierson	137	" I hope there is another feeling too . I think we feel that to speak of our sufferings or , deeper feelings is to obtrude oneself , to make a fuss , to be self - concerned , when we might be concerned with others . "
93514	93601	93602	93602	he	2536	" Monsieur , au fond we are all concerned with self . To seem selfless is but your particular way of cultivating the perfection of self . You admit that not to obtrude self is the way to perfect yourself . Eh bien ! What is that but a deeper concern with self ? To be free of this , there is no way but to forget all about oneself in what one is doing , as I forget everything when I am painting . But , "
93610	93660	93602	93602	he	2536	" you would not wish to forget the perfecting of self - it would not be right in your profession . So I must take away this picture , must I not ? It is one of my best works : I regret much not to have finished it . "
93661	93667	93462	93462	Pierson	137	" Some day , perhaps - "
93668	93714	93721	93721	he	2536	" Some day ! The picture will stand still , but mademoiselle will not . She will rush at something , and behold ! this face will be gone . No ; I prefer to keep it as it is . It has truth now . "
93733	93747	93748	93748	He	2536	" Bon soir , monsieur , you have been very good to me . "
93766	93769	93748	93748	He	2536	" Adieu ! "
93770	93775	93776	93776	Pierson	137	" Good - bye , "
93779	93784	93776	93776	Pierson	137	" God bless you ! "
93785	93798	93800	93800	Lavendie	253	" I do n't know if I have great confidence in Him , "
93802	93847	93800	93800	Lavendie	253	" but I shall ever remember that so good a man as you has wished it . To mademoiselle my distinguished salutations , if you please . If you will permit me , I will come back for my other things to - morrow . "
94079	94113	94076	94076	he	163	" Noel has gone down to George , and I want you to get transferred and go to them , Gracie . I 'm giving up the parish and asking for a chaplaincy . "
94114	94129	94076	94076	he	163	" Giving up ? After all this time ? Is it because of Nollie ? "
94130	94152	94076	94076	he	163	" No , I think not ; I think the time has come . I feel my work here is barren . "
94153	94169	94076	94076	he	163	" Oh , no ! And even if it is , it 's only because - "
94173	94180	94170	94170	Pierson	137	" Because of what , Gracie ? "
94181	94222	94076	94076	he	163	" Dad , it 's what I 've felt in myself . We want to think and decide things for ourselves , we want to own our consciences , we ca n't take things at second - hand any longer . "
94228	94231	94232	94232	he	2551	" Ah ! "
94235	94245	94232	94232	he	2551	" to have lost faith is a grievous thing . "
94246	94252	94254	94254	Gratian	127	" We 're gaining charity , "
94256	94267	94232	94232	he	2551	" The two things are not opposed , my dear . "
94268	94305	94232	94232	he	2551	" Not in theory ; but in practice I think they often are . Oh , Dad ! you look so tired . Have you really made up your mind ? Wo n't you feel lost ? "
94306	94319	94232	94232	he	2551	" For a little . I shall find myself , out there . "
95105	95119	95082	95082	he	2551	" Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . "
95273	95333	95271	95271	him	2551	" Friends , I am leaving you ; these are the last words I shall ever speak in this place . I go to other work . You have been very good to me . God has been very good to me . I pray with my whole heart that He may bless you all . Amen ! Amen ! "
95402	95462	95392	95392	she	628	" The peace of God , which passeth all understanding , keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God , and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord ; and the blessing of God Almighty , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , be amongst you and remain with you always . "
96157	96162	96163	96163	he	2551	" Noel 's gone ! "
96177	96215	96166	96166	She	208	" And you have n't gone too ? Ah , no ! Of course - your leg ! She fled , I suppose ? It was rather a jar , my coming in , I 'm afraid . "
96216	96229	96166	96166	She	208	" No ; it was my coming in that was the jar . "
96234	96247	96248	96248	She	208	" Jimmy ! I wonder you could discuss me . The rest - "
96253	96257	96248	96248	She	208	" But that ! "
96258	96281	96166	96166	She	208	" I was not discussing you . I merely said you were not to be envied for having me . Are you ? "
96312	96326	96308	96308	She	208	" I was to be envied . Oh ! Jimmy ; I was ! "
96387	96437	96376	96376	He	2605	" Leila , what is it ? You 're overtired . What 's the matter ? I could n't help the child 's being here . Why do you let it upset you ? She 's gone . It 's all right . Things are just as they were . "
96438	96441	96376	96376	He	2605	" Yes ! "
96447	96450	96376	96376	He	2605	" just ! "
96487	96492	96493	96493	he	2605	" Look at me ! "
96496	96510	96493	96493	he	2605	" What is it you want ? I 'm ready to do anything . "
96554	96559	96560	96560	she	208	" My dear Jimmy ! "
96563	96587	96588	96588	She	208	" I want you to do nothing but get me another cigarette . At my age one expects no more than one gets ! "
96596	96601	96588	96588	She	208	" Do you mind ? "
96720	96725	96726	96726	she	208	" Have one yourself , "
96729	96735	96726	96726	she	208	" The pipe of peace . "
96761	96764	96765	96765	she	208	" Yes , "
96769	96821	96765	96765	she	208	" I wonder where she 's gone . Can you see her ? She might do something reckless a second time . Poor Jimmy ! It would be a pity . And so that monk 's been here , and drunk champagne . Good idea ! Get me some , Jimmy ! "
96884	96890	96891	96891	she	208	" Come and sit down , "
96894	96901	96891	96891	she	208	" Is your leg hurting you ? "
96902	96908	96910	96910	he	175	" Not more than usual , "
96916	96932	96910	96910	he	175	" Wo n't you have some ? ' In vino veritas ; ' my friend . "
96942	96949	96933	96933	He	175	" I admire you , Leila . "
96950	96965	96967	96967	she	208	" That 's lucky . I do n't know anyone else who , would . "
96975	96981	96982	96982	she	208	" Do n't you wish , "
96986	97039	96982	96982	she	208	" that I had been one of those wonderful New Women , all brain and good works . How I should have talked the Universe up and down , and the war , and Causes , drinking tea , and never boring you to try and love me . What a pity ! "
97050	97060	97046	97046	Noel	197	" It 's awfully funny , is n't it ? "

97339	97354	97328	97328	she	208	" This is very dull . I think you 'd better go , Jimmy . "

100066	100141	100154	100154	He	2666	" Oh ! no . Needs must when the devil drives - that 's all . I do n't give up happiness of my own accord . That 's not within a hundred miles of the truth . What I shall become , I do n't know , but nothing better , you may be sure . I give up because I ca n't keep , and you know why . Where is Noel ? "
100142	100153	100053	100053	Leila	208	" Down at the sea , with George and Gratian . "
100174	100228	100053	100053	Leila	208	" I see the house is to let . Who 'd have thought a child like that could root up two fossils like us ? Never mind , Edward , there 's the same blood in us . We 'll keep our ends up in our own ways . Where are you going ? "
100229	100243	100154	100154	He	2666	" They 'll give me a chaplaincy in the East , I think . "
100267	100308	100053	100053	Leila	208	" What would have happened , Edward , if you had proposed to me that May week , when we were - a little bit in love ? Which would it have been , worst for , you or me ? "
100309	100319	100053	100053	Leila	208	" You would n't have taken me , Leila . "

101252	101301	101180	101180	she	2670	" How - how jolly ! I wanted to see you , so I came . And I have seen you , as you are , when you are n't with me . I shall remember it ; it was good for me - awfully good for me . "

101439	101479	101437	101437	him	2685	" Jimmy , if ever you loved me a little bit , be nice to me today . And if I say things - if I 'm bitter - do n't mind ; do n't notice it . Promise ! "

101774	101806	101763	101763	She	208	" That flower 's gone brown at the edges . Throw it away ; I ca n't bear faded flowers . Nor can you . Get yourself a fresh one tomorrow . "

103257	103273	103274	103274	he	294	" I can not express to you the feelings with which I received your letter - "
103618	103622	103615	103616	her father	384	" MY DEAREST NOLLIE ,
103623	104113	103615	103616	her father	384	" I am glad to say I have my chaplaincy , and am to start for Egypt very soon . I should have wished to go to France , but must take what I can get , in view of my age , for they really do n't want us who are getting on , I fear . It is a great comfort to me to think that Gratian is with you , and no doubt you will all soon be in a house where my little grandson can join you . I have excellent accounts of him in a letter from your aunt , just received : My child , you must never again think that my resignation has been due to you . It is not so . You know , or perhaps you do n't , that ever since the war broke out , I have chafed over staying at home , my heart has been with our boys out there , and sooner or later it must have come to this , apart from anything else . Monsieur Lavendie has been round in the evening , twice ; he is a nice man , I like him very much , in spite of our differences of view . He wanted to give me the sketch he made of you in the Park , but what can I do with it now ? And to tell you the truth , I like it no better than the oil painting . It is not a likeness , as I know you . I hope I did n't hurt his feelings , the feelings of an artist are so very easily wounded . There is one thing I must tell you . Leila has gone back to South Africa ; she came round one evening about ten days ago , to say goodbye . She was very brave , for I fear it means a great wrench for her . I hope and pray she may find comfort and tranquillity out there . And now , my dear , I want you to promise me not to see Captain Fort . I know that he admires you . But , apart from the question of his conduct in regard to Leila , he made the saddest impression on me by coming to our house the very day after her departure . There is something about that which makes me feel he can not be the sort of man in whom I could feel any confidence . I do n't suppose for a moment that he is in your thoughts , and yet before going so far from you , I feel I must warn you . I should rejoice to see you married to a good man ; but , though I do n't wish to think hardly of anyone , I can not believe Captain Fort is that .
104114	104148	103615	103616	her father	384	" I shall come down to you before I start , which may be in quite a short time now . My dear love to you and Gracie , and best wishes to George .
104149	104154	103615	103616	her father	384	" Your ever loving father ,

104409	104419	104344	104346	The old lady	2728	" I said : Is n't it very tiring ? "
104420	104433	104442	104444	The old lady	2728	" Not when I do n't think about it , my dear . "
104434	104441	104344	104346	The old lady	2728	" What do you think about ? "

105256	105275	105253	105253	he	132	" May I ask if you knew my friends , Doctor and Mrs. Laird , and Miss Pierson ? "
105282	105317	105276	105278	The old lady	2728	" Oh , yes ! A pretty young girl ; as pretty as life . She used to sit with me . Quite a pleasure to watch her ; such large eyes she had . "
105318	105329	105276	105278	The old lady	2728	" Where have they gone ? Can you tell me ? "
105330	105340	105276	105278	The old lady	2728	" Oh , I do n't know at all . "
105398	105412	105391	105391	he	132	" She used to sit just there ; quite still ; quite still . "
105434	105442	105444	105446	the old lady	2728	" What a dreadful war this is ! "
105448	105456	105444	105446	the old lady	2728	" Have you been at the front ? "
105457	105460	105444	105446	the old lady	2728	" Yes . "
105461	105484	105444	105446	the old lady	2728	" To think of the poor young girls who 'll never have husbands ! I 'm sure I think it 's dreadful . "
105485	105488	105490	105490	Fort	197	" Yes , "
105492	105497	105490	105490	Fort	197	" it 's dreadful - "
105507	105540	105444	105446	the old lady	2728	" Did you want Doctor and Mrs. Laird , sir ? East Bungalow their address is ; it 's a little way out on the North Road . Anyone will tell you . "
105562	105568	105550	105560	the old lady who had called Noel as pretty as life	2777	" Good afternoon , ma'am . "
105569	105573	105586	105586	her	2777	" Good afternoon . "
105832	105849	105825	105825	she	4141	" How do you do ? Have you seen Gratian ; she ought to be in . "
105850	105865	105866	105866	Noel	197	" I did n't come to see her ; I came to see you . "
105872	105877	105866	105866	Noel	197	" Here he is . "
105951	105959	105960	105960	he	197	" I wonder what they think about , "
105973	105983	105963	105963	Noel	197	" They only think when they want some thing . "
105984	106000	105963	105963	Noel	197	" That 's a deep saying : but his eyes are awfully interested in you . "
106019	106025	106026	106026	she	2792	" He 's a darling , "
106051	106056	106057	106057	she	2792	" Daddy is here , "
106065	106084	106057	106057	she	2792	" He 's sailing for Egypt the day after to - morrow . He does n't like you . "
106111	106116	106117	106117	he	197	" I expected that , "
106120	106130	106117	106117	he	197	" I 'm a sinner , as you know . "
106137	106140	106141	106141	she	2792	" Sin ! "
106195	106208	106192	106192	He	197	" I 'll go and see your father . Is he in ? "
106209	106214	106253	106253	her	2792	" I think so . "
106215	106223	106192	106192	He	197	" May I come to - morrow ? "
106224	106235	106253	106253	her	2792	" It 's Sunday ; and Daddy 's last day . "
106236	106242	106192	106192	He	197	" Ah ! Of course . "
106371	106394	106367	106367	he	197	" I 've come to ask you , sir , for your permission to marry Noel , if she will have me . "
106409	106422	106395	106395	He	197	" Did you know I was here , then , Captain Fort ? "
106423	106462	106367	106367	he	197	" I saw Noel in the garden . I 've said nothing to her , of course . But she told me you were starting to - morrow for Egypt , so I shall have no other chance . "
106463	106490	106395	106395	He	197	" I am sorry you have come . It is not for me to judge , but I do n't think you will make Noel happy . "
106491	106500	106367	106367	he	197	" May I ask you why , sir ? "
106501	106547	106395	106395	He	197	" Captain Fort , the world 's judgment of these things is not mine ; but since you ask me . I will tell you frankly . My cousin Leila has a claim on you . It is her you should ask to marry you . "
106548	106557	106367	106367	he	197	" I did ask her ; she refused . "
106558	106575	106395	106395	He	197	" I know . She would not refuse you again if you went out to her . "
106576	106605	106367	106367	he	197	" I am not free to go out to her ; besides , she would refuse . She knows I do n't love her , and never have . "
106606	106610	106395	106395	He	197	" Never have ? "
106611	106614	106367	106367	he	197	" No . "
106615	106619	106395	106395	He	197	" Then why - "
106620	106633	106367	106367	he	197	" Because I 'm a man , I suppose , and a fool "
106634	106702	106395	106395	He	197	" If it was simply , ' because you are a man ' as you call it , it is clear that no principle or faith governs you . And yet you ask me to give you Noel ; my poor Noel , who wants the love and protection not of a ' man ' but of a good man . No , Captain Fort , no ! "
106708	106787	106703	106703	Fort	197	" I 'm clearly not a good man in your sense of the word ; but I love her terribly , and I would protect her . I do n't in the least know whether she 'll have me . I do n't expect her to , naturally . But I warn you that I mean to ask her , and to wait for her . I 'm so much in love that I can do nothing else . "
106788	106806	106807	106807	Fort	197	" The man who is truly in love does what is best for the one he loves . "
106828	106833	106834	106834	he	197	" That 's true , "
106837	106893	106834	106834	he	197	" And I shall never trade on her position . If she ca n't feel anything for me now or in the future , I sha n't trouble her , you may be sure of that . But if by some wonderful chance she should , I know I can make her happy , sir . "
106894	106900	106823	106826	his head - master	2800	" She is a child . "
106901	106910	106912	106912	Fort	197	" No , she 's not a child , "
106924	106957	106915	106915	Pierson	198	" Captain Fort , I am going far away from her , and leaving her without protection . I trust to your chivalry not to ask her , till I come back . "
106964	107022	106958	106958	Fort	197	" No , no , I wo n't accept that position . With or without your presence the facts will be the same . Either she can love me , or she ca n't . If she can , she 'll be happier with me . If she ca n't , there 's an end of it . "
107030	107035	107036	107036	he	197	" In my view , "
107039	107054	107036	107036	he	197	" you are as bound to Leila as if you were married to her . "
107055	107071	107100	107100	Fort	197	" You ca n't , expect me to take the priest 's view , sir . "
107077	107099	107072	107072	Pierson	198	" You call it a priest 's view ; I think it is only the view of a man of honour . "
107103	107110	107111	107111	he	197	" That 's for my conscience , "
107115	107210	107111	107111	he	197	" I ca n't tell you , and I 'm not going to , how things began . I was a fool . But I did my best , and I know that Leila does n't think I 'm bound . If she had , she would never have gone . When there 's no feeling - there never was real feeling on my side - and when there 's this terribly real feeling for Noel , which I never sought , which I tried to keep down , which I ran away from - "
107211	107215	107072	107072	Pierson	198	" Did you ? "
107216	107256	107111	107111	he	197	" Yes . To go on with the other was foul . I should have thought you might have seen that , sir ; but I did go on with it . It was Leila who made an end . "
107257	107265	107072	107072	Pierson	198	" Leila behaved nobly , I think . "
107266	107280	107111	107111	he	197	" She was splendid ; but that does n't make me a brute . "
107295	107302	107303	107303	he	2801	" It is repugnant to me , "
107306	107318	107303	107303	he	2801	" Is there never to be any purity in her life ? "
107319	107358	107072	107072	Pierson	198	" Is there never to be any life for her ? At your rate , sir , there will be none . I 'm no worse than other men , and I love her more than they could . "
107371	107423	107368	107368	he	2801	" Forgive me if I 've spoken harshly . I did n't mean to . I love her intensely ; I wish for nothing but her good . But all my life I have believed that for a man there is only one woman - for a woman only one man . "
107424	107429	107430	107430	Fort	197	" Then , Sir , "
107434	107439	107430	107430	Fort	197	" you wish her - "
107465	107475	107476	107476	he	197	" We are all made of flesh and blood , "
107480	107493	107476	107476	he	197	" and it seems to me that you think we are n't . "
107494	107503	107443	107443	his	2801	" We have spirits too , Captain Fort . "
107516	107550	107476	107476	he	197	" I have a great respect for you , sir ; but a greater love for Noel , and nothing in this world will prevent me trying to give my life to her . "
107559	107574	107555	107555	Pierson	198	" If you try , then I can but pray that you will fail . "
107797	107827	107829	107829	he	197	" It 's nothing to me now , but it will mean a lot to him out there , as a memory of us . So I must go . "
107833	107871	107829	107829	he	197	" Quite right , my dear . Let him have all he can get of you both to - day . I 'll keep out of the way , and be back the last thing at night . "

109045	109050	108991	108991	She	127	" She told me . "
109051	109059	108991	108991	She	127	" What is her feeling about him ? "
109060	109077	108991	108991	She	127	" I do n't think she knows . Nollie dreams along , and then suddenly rushes . "

109127	109149	109156	109156	he	150	" Poor thing ! You 're like my Nollie ; so soft , and dreamy , so feckless , so reckless . "

109175	109249	109172	109172	Gratian	127	" we can only find out for ourselves , even if we do singe our wings in doing it . We 've been reading James 's ' Pragmatism . ' George says the only chapter that 's important is missing - the one on ethics , to show that what we do is not wrong till it 's proved wrong by the result . I suppose he was afraid to deliver that lecture . "
109274	109288	109267	109267	George	140	" Ah , George , that 's very clever ; but I know . "
109289	109293	109294	109294	he	150	" My dear , "
109297	109314	109294	109294	he	150	" that doctrine is the most dangerous in the world . I am surprised at George . "
109315	109327	109267	109267	George	140	" I do n't think George is in danger , Dad . "
109328	109366	109294	109294	he	150	" George is a man of wide experience and strong judgment and character ; but think how fatal it would be for Nollie , my poor Nollie , whom a little gust can blow into the candle . "
109367	109372	109374	109374	Gratian	127	" All the same , "

I sha n't see you to - morrow ; you must n't get up ; I can bear parting better like this . And my train goes at eight . God bless you , Gracie ; give George my love . I know , I have always known that he 's a good man , though we do fight so . Good - bye , my darling . "

He ought to be running and skipping in it : it 's such a shame to tie things up . Did you never , feel wild in your heart , Daddy ? "
109861	109880	109784	109784	She	2849	" Always , I think , Nollie ; too wild . It 's been hard to tame oneself . "
109889	109924	109881	109881	Noel	197	" Let 's go and take the goat and skip together on the hills . If only we had a penny whistle ! Did you hear the bugle ? The bugle and the goat ! "
109932	109957	109958	109958	He	150	" Nollie , be good while I 'm away . You know what I do n't want . I told you in my letter . "

109991	110081	109987	109987	she	2849	" on a night like this , all the things , all the things - the stars have lives , Daddy , and the moon has a big life , and the shadows have , and the moths and the birds and the goats and the trees , and the flowers , and all of us - escaped ? Oh ! Daddy , why is there a war ? And why are people so bound and so unhappy ? Do n't tell me it 's God - do n't ! "
110104	110215	110096	110096	he	150	" O for a deep and dewy Spring , With runlets cold to draw and drink , And a great meadow blossoming , Long - grassed , and poplars in a ring , To rest me by the brink . O take me to the mountain , O , Past the great pines and through the wood , Up where the lean hounds softly go , A - whine for wild things ' blood , And madly flies the dappled roe , O God , to shout and speed them there ; An arrow by my chestnut hair Drawn tight and one keen glimmering spear Ah ! if I could ! "
110301	110308	110309	110309	she	525	" Is n't beauty terribly alive , "
110312	110326	110309	110309	she	525	" like a lovely person ? it makes you ache to kiss it . "
110332	110341	110342	110342	he	197	" There is a beauty beyond all that , "
110346	110349	110365	110365	Noel	197	" Where ? "
110350	110363	110365	110365	Noel	197	" Holiness , duty , faith . O Nollie , my love ! "
110373	110383	110384	110384	she	525	" Shall I tell you what I should like ? "
110387	110407	110384	110384	she	525	" To take God 's hand and show Him things . I 'm certain He 's not seen everything . "
110439	110448	110365	110365	Noel	197	" My dear , what things you say ! "
110449	110530	110531	110531	She	525	" But He has n't , and it 's time He did . We 'd creep , and peep , and see it all for once , as He ca n't in His churches . Daddy , oh ! Daddy ! I ca n't bear it any more ; to think of them being killed on a night like this ; killed and killed so that they never see it all again - never see it - never see it ! "
110543	110584	110531	110531	She	525	" I ca n't , I ca n't ! Oh ! take it all away , the cruelty ! Why does it come - why the stars and the flowers , if God does n't care any more than that ? "
110609	110626	110587	110587	he	2851	" Come , Nollie ! This life is but a minute . We must all die . "
110627	110636	110637	110637	She	525	" But not they - not so young ! "
110647	110664	110637	110637	She	525	" Daddy , I do n't want you to go ; promise me to come back ! "
110675	110699	110709	110709	her	525	" My dear sweetheart , of course ! Come , Nollie , get up . The sun 's been too much for you . "
110714	110736	110706	110706	her	525	" Forgive me for all my badness , and all my badness to come , especially all my badness to come ! "
110740	110778	110737	110737	Pierson	150	" I shall always forgive you , Nollie ; but there wo n't be - there must n't be any badness to come . I pray God to keep you , and make you like your mother . "
110779	110791	110829	110829	She	1090	" Mother never had a devil , like you and me . "
110833	110840	110829	110829	She	1090	" I do n't hate my devil .
110841	110909	110829	110829	She	1090	" Why should I ? - it 's part of me . Every day when the sun sets , I 'll think of you , Daddy ; and you might do the same - that 'll keep me good . I sha n't come to the station tomorrow , I should only cry . And I sha n't say good - bye now . It 's unlucky . "
110951	110963	110964	110964	he	384	" There never was anyone more loving than you ; Nollie ! "
110968	110980	110964	110964	he	384	" Remember my letter . And good night , my love ! "
111014	111019	111069	111069	her	1090	" George , George ! "
111040	111058	111034	111034	Noel	197	" George , let the goat loose , just for to - night , to please me . "
111291	111298	111299	111299	he	140	" Of course Nollie was crazy , "
111302	111415	111299	111299	he	140	" but when she did what she did , she at once began to think differently about life and morals . The deepest instinct we all have is the instinct that we must do what we must , and think that what we 've done is really all right ; in fact the - instinct of self - preservation . We 're all fighting animals ; and we feel in our bones that if we admit we 're beaten - we are beaten ; but that every fight we win , especially against odds , hardens those bones . But personally I do n't think she can make good on her own . "
111429	111470	111416	111416	Gratian	127	" No , I do n't think she can . And if she could I 'm not sure . But is n't Pragmatism a perfectly beastly word , George ? It has no sense of humour in it at all . "
111471	111497	111416	111416	Gratian	127	" It is a bit thick , and in the hands of the young , deuced likely to become Prigmatism ; but not with Nollie . "
111615	111657	111610	111610	George	140	" You are n't strong enough yet , my dear : Wait till the harvest begins . Then you can go and help on the farm here . If you can stand that without damage , we 'll think about it . "
111759	111767	111772	111772	she	127	" Yes , she 's a brick . "
111775	111785	111772	111772	she	127	" I do n't want to think about her . "
111796	111816	111792	111792	Gratian	127	" Do n't you think it 's queer we 've never heard from Captain Fort since he came down ? "
111824	111838	111821	111821	Noel	197	" Why should we , after being told that he was n't liked ? "
111839	111845	111818	111818	her	127	" Who told him that ? "
111846	111865	111866	111866	She	127	" I told him , that Daddy did n't ; but I expect Daddy said much worse things . "
111876	111885	111866	111866	She	127	" Daddy 's wonderful , is n't he ? "
111886	111889	111818	111818	her	127	" How ? "
111890	111935	111866	111866	She	127	" The way he drives one to do the other thing . If he had n't opposed my marriage to Cyril , you know , that would n't have happened , it just made all the difference . It stirred me up so fearfully . "
111962	111967	111866	111866	She	127	" DEAR MRS . LAIRD ,
111968	112072	111866	111866	She	127	" You know all about things , of course , except the one thing which to me is all important . I ca n't go on without knowing whether I have a chance with your sister . It is against your father 's expressed wish that she should have anything to do with me , but I told him that I could not and would not promise not to ask her . I get my holiday at the end of this month , and am coming down to put it to the touch . It means more to me than you can possibly imagine .
112073	112080	111866	111866	She	127	" I am , dear Mrs. Laird ,
112081	112086	111866	111866	She	127	" Your very faithful servant ,
112087	112091	111866	111866	She	127	" JAMES FORT . "
112103	112155	112097	112097	George	140	" Answer it politely , but say nothing ; and nothing to Nollie . I think it would be a very good thing . Of course it 's a bit of a make - shift - twice her age ; but he 's a genuine man , if not exactly brilliant . "
112161	112172	112156	112156	Gratian	127	" I 've always wanted the very best for Nollie . "
112196	112200	112201	112201	he	140	" Quite so , "
112204	112250	112201	112201	he	140	" But you must remember , Gracie , that out of the swan she was , Nollie has made herself into a lame duck . Fifty per cent at least is off her value , socially . We must look at things as they are . "
112251	112258	112259	112259	George	140	" Father is dead against it . "
112287	112330	112282	112282	he	140	" I agree that we 're bound by his absence not to further it actively . Still Nollie knows his wishes , and it 's up to her and no one else . After all , she 's no longer a child . "
112428	112463	112419	112420	Uncle Bob	141	" We 're getting quite fossilised down here ; Eve 's gone and left us again . We miss you and the youngster awfully . Come along down , Nollie there 's a dear ! "
112464	112469	112470	112470	Noel	197	" They 're darlings , "
112473	112506	112470	112470	Noel	197	" but I sha n't go . I 'm too restless , ever since Daddy went ; you do n't know how restless . This rain simply makes me want to die . "
113677	113687	113688	113688	she	2876	" I did want that rabbit to get off , "
113692	113702	113688	113688	she	2876	" I 've been watching it . Thank you ! "
113708	113712	113715	113715	he	587	" My goodness ! "
113727	113739	113718	113718	Noel	197	" Yes , I know ; is my nose very red ? "
113740	113755	113780	113780	he	197	" No ; you 're as lovely as Ruth , if she was lovely . "
113783	113815	113780	113780	he	197	" No , let me do this little bit . I have n't had a day in the fields since the war began . Talk to me while I 'm binding . "
113845	113858	113821	113821	He	197	" I did n't know you knew about this sort of thing . "
113859	113897	113821	113821	He	197	" Oh , Lord , yes ! I had a farm once out West . Nothing like field - work , to make you feel good . I 've been watching you ; you bind jolly well . "
113905	113912	113913	113913	she	2876	" Where have you come from ? "
113916	113928	113929	113929	He	197	" Straight from the station . I 'm on my holiday . "
113989	113997	114040	114040	his	197	" Will you come in to supper ? "
113998	114004	114040	114040	his	197	" I 'd love to . "

117781	117784	117758	117758	They	2983	" DARLING DAD ,
117785	117943	117758	117758	They	2983	" I do hope this will reach you before you move on to Palestine . You said in your last - at the end of September , so I hope you 'll just get it . There is one great piece of news , which I 'm afraid will hurt and trouble you ; Nollie is married to Jimmy Fort . They were married down here this afternoon , and have just gone up to Town . They have to find a house of course . She has been very restless , lonely , and unhappy ever since you went , and I 'm sure it is really for the best : She is quite another creature , and simply devoted , headlong . It 's just like Nollie . She says she did n't know what she wanted , up to the last minute . But now she seems as if she could never want anything else .
117944	118308	117758	117758	They	2983	" Dad dear , Nollie could never have made good by herself . It is n't her nature , and it 's much better like this , I feel sure , and so does George . Of course it is n't ideal - and one wanted that for her ; but she did break her wing , and he is so awfully good and devoted to her , though you did n't believe it , and perhaps wo n't , even now . The great thing is to feel her happy again , and know she 's safe . Nollie is capable of great devotion ; only she must be anchored . She was drifting all about ; and one does n't know what she might have done , in one of her moods . I do hope you wo n't grieve about it . She 's dreadfully anxious about how you 'll feel . I know it will be wretched for you , so far off ; but do try and believe it 's for the best .... She 's out of danger ; and she was really in a horrible position . It 's so good for the baby , too , and only fair to him . I do think one must take things as they are , Dad dear . It was impossible to mend Nollie 's wing . If she were a fighter , and gloried in it , or if she were the sort who would ' take the veil ' - but she is n't either . So it is all right , Dad . She 's writing to you herself . I 'm sure Leila did n't want Jimmy Fort to be unhappy because he could n't love her ; or she would never have gone away . George sends you his love ; we are both very well . And Nollie is looking splendid still , after her harvest work . All , all my love , Dad dear . Is there anything we can get , and send you ? Do take care of your blessed self , and do n't grieve about Nollie .
118309	118312	117758	117758	They	2983	" GRATIAN . "
118337	118340	118322	118322	he	2988	" DADDY DARLING ,
118341	118354	118322	118322	he	2988	" I 've done it . Forgive me - I 'm so happy .
118355	118359	118322	118322	he	2988	" Your NOLLIE . "
118554	118579	118548	118549	A nurse	3053	" The poor boy at the end of A ward is sinking fast , sir ; I expect he 'd like to see you . "
118624	118630	118631	118631	she	2999	" He 's quite conscious , "
118634	118648	118631	118631	she	2999	" he can still speak a little . He 's such a dear . "
118902	118910	118891	118891	his	840	" I 'm goin' West , zurr . "
118959	118967	118968	118968	he	840	" To God , my dear son ! "
