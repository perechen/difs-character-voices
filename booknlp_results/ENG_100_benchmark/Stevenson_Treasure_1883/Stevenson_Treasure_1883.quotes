And I 'm to lose my chance for you ! I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach ! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . "

12638	12661	12662	12662	he	83	" is just about as good as nothing . They 've got off clean , and there 's an end . Only , "
12665	12677	12662	12662	he	83	" I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , "
12774	12802	12765	12766	Mr. Dance	83	" They got the money , you say ? Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ? More money , I suppose ? "
12803	12814	12816	12816	I.	0	" No , sir ; not money , I think , "
12817	12851	12816	12816	I.	0	" In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . "

12897	12996	12892	12892	he	83	" perfectly right a gentleman and a magistrate . And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire . Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can . Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . "

This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive . Hawkins , will you ring that bell ? Mr. Dance must have some ale . "
13686	13692	13694	13695	the doctor	289	" And so , Jim , "
13697	13710	13694	13695	the doctor	289	" you have the thing that they were after , have you ? "
13711	13718	13720	13720	I	0	" Here it is , sir , "

13825	13832	13834	13835	the squire	661	" As you will , Livesey , "
13837	13846	13834	13835	the squire	661	" Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . "
13888	13894	13896	13897	the doctor	289	" And now , squire , "
13899	13905	13907	13908	the squire	661	" And now , Livesey , "
13914	13925	13907	13908	the squire	661	" One at a time , one at a time , "
13930	13941	13927	13928	Dr. Livesey	63	" You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? "
13942	13947	13949	13950	the squire	661	" Heard of him ! "
13952	14039	13949	13950	the squire	661	" Heard of him , you say ! He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed . Blackbeard was a child to Flint . The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman . I 've seen his top - sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum - puncheon that I sailed with put back put back , sir , into Port of Spain . "
14040	14053	14055	14056	the doctor	289	" Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , "
14058	14068	14055	14056	the doctor	289	" But the point is , had he money ? "
14069	14072	14074	14075	the squire	661	" Money ! "
14077	14111	14074	14075	the squire	661	" Have you heard the story ? What were these villains after but money ? What do they care for but money ? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? "
14112	14119	14121	14122	the doctor	289	" That we shall soon know , "
14124	14176	14121	14122	the doctor	289	" But you are so confoundedly hot - headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in . What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? "
14177	14182	14184	14185	the squire	661	" Amount , sir ! "
14187	14232	14184	14185	the squire	661	" It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . "
14233	14237	14239	14240	the doctor	289	" Very well , "
14242	14257	14260	14260	he	289	" Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet "
14305	14315	14317	14318	the doctor	289	" First of all we 'll try the book , "

14457	14461	14490	14491	Dr. Livesey	63	" got itt , "
14464	14466	14469	14469	he	289	" itt "

14704	14713	14715	14716	the squire	661	" The thing is as clear as noonday , "
14718	14801	14715	14716	the squire	661	" This is the black - hearted hound 's account - book . These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered . The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer . ' Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast . God help the poor souls that manned her coral long ago . "
14802	14805	14807	14808	the doctor	289	" Right ! "
14810	14836	14807	14808	the doctor	289	" See what it is to be a traveller . Right ! And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . "
14875	14879	14881	14882	the doctor	289	" Thrifty man ! "
14884	14894	14881	14882	the doctor	289	" He was n't the one to be cheated . "
14895	14899	14901	14902	the squire	661	" And now , "
14904	14909	14901	14902	the squire	661	" for the other . "

15242	15367	15239	15240	the squire	661	" you will give up this wretched practice at once . Tomorrow I start for Bristol . In three weeks ' time three weeks ! two weeks ten days we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England . Hawkins shall come as cabin - boy . You 'll make a famous cabin - boy , Hawkins . You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral . We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter . We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . "

15376	15413	15373	15374	the doctor	289	" I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking . There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . "
15414	15420	15422	15423	the squire	661	" And who 's that ? "
15425	15432	15422	15423	the squire	661	" Name the dog , sir ! "
15433	15436	15438	15439	the doctor	289	" You , "
15441	15570	15438	15439	the doctor	289	" for you can not hold your tongue . We are not the only men who know of this paper . These fellows who attacked the inn tonight bold , desperate blades , for sure and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money . We must none of us go alone till we get to sea . Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . "
15571	15574	15576	15577	the squire	661	" Livesey , "
15579	15598	15576	15577	the squire	661	" you are always in the right of it . I 'll be as silent as the grave . "

16075	16094	16072	16073	the gamekeeper	741	" A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . "
17396	17401	17402	17402	I	0	" Where are we ? "
17405	17408	17410	17410	Tom	91	" Bristol , "
17412	17416	17410	17410	Tom	91	" Get down . "
17708	17713	17714	17714	he	874	" Here you are , "
17717	17735	17714	17714	he	874	" and the doctor came last night from London . Bravo ! The ship 's company complete ! "
17736	17741	17743	17743	I	0	" Oh , sir , "
17745	17751	17743	17743	I	0	" when do we sail ? "

18276	18299	18258	18258	he	904	" And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start . "
18302	18314	18258	18258	he	904	" said he , quite loud , and offering his hand . "
18333	18416	18318	18318	You	0	" And he took my hand in his large firm grasp . Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door . It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment . But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance . It was the tallow - faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow . "
18419	18432	18318	18318	You	0	" I cried , ' stop him ! It 's Black Dog ! "

18554	18587	18552	18552	Silver	101	" In my house ! Ben , run and help Harry . One of those swabs , was he ? Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ? Step up here . "
18614	18619	18621	18622	Long John	95	" Now , Morgan , "
18626	18644	18621	18622	Long John	95	" you never clapped your eyes on that Black Black Dog before , did you , now ? "
18645	18651	18653	18653	Morgan	104	" Not I , sir , "
18658	18669	18653	18653	Morgan	104	" You did n't know his name , did you ? "
18670	18675	18621	18622	Long John	95	" No , sir . "
18676	18691	18693	18694	the landlord	910	" By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! "
18696	18734	18693	18694	the landlord	910	" If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that . And what was he saying to you ? "
18735	18744	18746	18746	Morgan	104	" I do n't rightly know , sir , "
18748	18766	18768	18769	Long John	95	" Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead - eye ? "
18771	18818	18768	18769	Long John	95	" Do n't rightly know , do n't you ! Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ? Come , now , what was he jawing v'yages , cap'ns , ships ? Pipe up ! What was it ? "
18819	18831	18833	18833	Morgan	104	" We was a - talkin ' of keel - hauling , "
18835	18869	18833	18833	Morgan	104	" Keel - hauling , was you ? And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that . Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . "
18898	18915	18916	18916	he	95	" He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on'y stupid . And now , "
18923	18969	18916	18916	he	95	" let 's see Black Dog ? No , I do n't know the name , not I. Yet I kind of think I 've yes , I 've seen the swab . He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . "
18970	18980	18982	18982	I.	0	" That he did , you may be sure , "
18983	18996	18916	18916	he	95	" I knew that blind man too . His name was Pew . "
18997	19001	19003	19003	Silver	95	" It was ! "
19009	19091	19003	19003	Silver	95	" Pew ! That were his name for certain . Ah , he looked a shark , he did ! If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney ! Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben . He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers ! He talked o ' keel - hauling , did he ? I'LL keel - haul him ! "
19223	19231	19233	19233	he	911	" See here , now , Hawkins , "
19235	19402	19233	19233	he	911	" here 's a blessed hard thing on a man like me , now , ai n't it ? There 's Cap'n Trelawney what 's he to think ? Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum ! Here you comes and tells me of it plain ; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights ! Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap'n . You 're a lad , you are , but you 're as smart as paint . I see that when you first come in . Now , here it is : What could I do , with this old timber I hobble on ? When I was an A B master mariner I 'd have come up alongside of him , hand over hand , and broached him to in a brace of old shakes , I would ; but now "
19425	19429	19430	19430	he	920	" The score ! "
19434	19455	19430	19430	he	920	" Three goes o ' rum ! Why , shiver my timbers , if I had n't forgotten my score ! "
19493	19506	19507	19507	he	920	" Why , what a precious old sea - calf I am ! "
19516	19650	19507	19507	he	920	" You and me should get on well , Hawkins , for I 'll take my davy I should be rated ship 's boy . But come now , stand by to go about . This wo n't do . Dooty is dooty , messmates . I 'll put on my old cockerel hat , and step along of you to Cap'n Trelawney , and report this here affair . For mind you , it 's serious , young Hawkins ; and neither you nor me 's come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit . Nor you neither , says you ; not smart none of the pair of us smart . But dash my buttons ! That was a good un about my score . "
19848	19863	19864	19864	he	95	" That was how it were , now , were n't it , Hawkins ? "

19961	19988	19958	19959	Dr. Livesey	63	" I do n't put much faith in your discoveries , as a general thing ; but I will say this , John Silver suits me . "

20211	20225	20227	20228	the squire	661	" I am always at the captain 's orders . Show him in , "
20250	20273	20230	20238	The captain , who was close behind his messenger	953	" Well , Captain Smollett , what have you to say ? All well , I hope ; all shipshape and seaworthy ? "
20274	20279	20281	20282	the captain	234	" Well , sir , "
20284	20327	20281	20282	the captain	234	" better speak plain , I believe , even at the risk of offence . I do n't like this cruise ; I do n't like the men ; and I do n't like my officer . That 's short and sweet . "
20328	20340	20342	20343	the squire	661	" Perhaps , sir , you do n't like the ship ? "
20353	20370	20372	20373	the captain	234	" I ca n't speak as to that , sir , not having seen her tried , "
20375	20388	20372	20373	the captain	234	" She seems a clever craft ; more I ca n't say . "
20389	20403	20405	20406	the squire	661	" Possibly , sir , you may not like your employer , either ? "
20415	20420	20422	20422	he	63	" Stay a bit , "
20485	20486	20487	20487	I	0	" "

20933	20938	20931	20931	captain	2845	" asked the doctor . "

20965	20970	20952	20952	you	63	" answered the squire . "
20974	20979	20952	20952	you	63	" said the captain . "
21078	21079	21052	21052	they	982	" "
21083	21088	21052	21052	they	982	" asked Mr. Trelawney . "
21092	21097	21052	21052	they	982	" said the captain . "
21106	21107	21052	21052	they	982	" "
21112	21117	21052	21052	they	982	" agreed the doctor . "

21161	21172	21173	21173	I	0	" And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly . "

21228	21288	21209	21209	you	2853	" replied the doctor . And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations . Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island . "
21293	21298	21291	21291	gentlemen	979	" continued the captain , "
21337	21338	21339	21339	I	0	" "

21401	21406	21399	21399	Sir	2853	" said Captain Smollett , "
21528	21529	21530	21531	Captain Smollett	108	" "
21533	21541	21530	21531	Captain Smollett	108	" began the doctor with a smile , "
21590	21591	21584	21584	you	108	" "
21594	21599	21592	21592	Doctor	2886	" said the captain , "
21627	21628	21620	21621	Mr. Trelawney	86	" "
21634	21639	21620	21621	Mr. Trelawney	86	" cried the squire . "

21688	21693	21683	21683	you	2886	" said the captain . "
21702	21711	21712	21712	Trelawney	86	" And with that he took his leave . "
21714	21719	21712	21712	Trelawney	86	" said the doctor , "
21746	21747	21743	21744	John Silver	95	" "
21754	21759	21751	21751	you	108	" cried the squire ; "

21797	22088	21769	21769	I	0	" When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo - ho - ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending . The new arrangement was quite to my liking . The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after - part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side . It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths . Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round - house . Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement . Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion . We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore - boat . The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , "
22094	22098	22092	22092	mates	2978	" says he . "
22103	22104	22092	22092	mates	2978	" "
22116	22120	22114	22114	Jack	73	" answers one . "
22127	22132	22114	22114	Jack	73	" cried Long John , "
22144	22145	22146	22146	My	0	" "
22149	22155	22146	22146	My	0	" said the captain shortly . "
22169	22170	22175	22175	sir	2853	" "
22177	22198	22175	22175	sir	2853	" answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley . "
22207	22212	22205	22205	captain	2845	" said the doctor . "
22218	22223	22216	22216	sir	2853	" replied Captain Smollett . "
22231	22262	22228	22228	men	475	" he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , "
22270	22274	22264	22264	you	1014	" he cried , "
22291	22311	22312	22312	I	0	" And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , "
22321	22341	22312	22312	I	0	" I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply .
22484	22494	22517	22518	Long John	95	" Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , "
22499	22504	22517	22518	Long John	95	" The old one , "
22508	22515	22517	22518	Long John	95	" Aye , aye , mates , "
22547	22556	22526	22526	his	95	" Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest "
22565	22578	22559	22561	the whole crew	1034	" Yo - ho - ho , and a bottle of rum ! "
22583	22586	22559	22561	the whole crew	1034	" Ho ! "
23008	23011	23013	23014	the captain	234	" Overboard ! "
23016	23031	23013	23014	the captain	234	" Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . "
23328	23337	23339	23340	the coxswain	1065	" He 's no common man , Barbecue , "
23344	23387	23339	23340	the coxswain	1065	" He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John ! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together him unarmed . "
23454	23460	23461	23461	he	110	" Come away , Hawkins , "
23465	23522	23461	23461	he	110	" come and have a yarn with John . Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son . Sit you down and hear the news . Here 's Cap'n Flint I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage . Was n't you , cap'n ? "
23533	23546	23461	23461	he	110	" Pieces of eight ! Pieces of eight ! Pieces of eight ! "
23568	23574	23575	23575	he	110	" Now , that bird , "
23579	23721	23575	23575	he	110	" is , maybe , two hundred years old , Hawkins they live forever mostly ; and if anybody 's seen more wickedness , it must be the devil himself . She 's sailed with England , the great Cap'n England , the pirate . She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello . She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships . It 's there she learned ' Pieces of eight , ' and little wonder ; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em , Hawkins ! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was ; and to look at her you would think she was a babby . But you smelt powder did n't you , cap'n ? "
23722	23729	23575	23575	he	110	" Stand by to go about , "
23735	23747	23748	23749	the cook	916	" Ah , she 's a handsome craft , she is , "
23780	23783	23784	23784	John	95	" There , "
23788	23841	23784	23784	John	95	" you ca n't touch pitch and not be mucked , lad . Here 's this poor old innocent bird o ' mine swearing blue fire , and none the wiser , you may lay to that . She would swear the same , in a manner of speaking , before chaplain . "
23981	24008	24009	24009	he	234	" She 'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife , sir . But , "
24013	24033	24009	24009	he	234	" all I say is , we 're not home again , and I do n't like the cruise . "
24055	24063	24064	24064	he	661	" A trifle more of that man , "
24068	24074	24064	24064	he	661	" and I shall explode . "
24185	24194	24195	24196	the captain	234	" Never knew good come of it yet , "
24202	24215	24195	24196	the captain	234	" Spoil forecastle hands , make devils . That 's my belief . "
24657	24663	24665	24665	Silver	95	" NO , not I , "
24667	24833	24665	24665	Silver	95	" Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg . The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights . It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me out of college and all Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun - dried like the rest , at Corso Castle . That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships ROYAL FORTUNE and so on . Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says . So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . "
24834	24837	24844	24848	the youngest hand on board	1124	" Ah ! "
24856	24868	24665	24665	Silver	95	" He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! "
24869	24880	24882	24882	Silver	95	" Davis was a man too , by all accounts , "
24884	25087	24882	24882	Silver	95	" I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking . I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint . That ai n't bad for a man before the mast all safe in bank . ' Tain't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that . Where 's all England 's men now ? I dunno . Where 's Flint 's ? Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff been begging before that , some on 'em . Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament . Where is he now ? Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving ! He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! "
25088	25100	25102	25104	the young seaman	1125	" Well , it ai n't much use , after all , "
25106	25124	25126	25126	Silver	95	" ' Tain't much use for fools , you may lay to it that , nor nothing , "
25128	25172	25126	25126	Silver	95	" But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint . I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . "
25233	25411	25223	25223	he	1127	" Here it is about gentlemen of fortune . They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting - cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets . Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts . But that 's not the course I lay . I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion . I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest . Time enough too , says you . Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea . And how did I begin ? Before the mast , like you ! "
25412	25415	25417	25418	the other	350	" Well , "
25420	25444	25223	25223	he	1127	" but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ? You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . "
25445	25455	25457	25457	Silver	95	" Why , where might you suppose it was ? "
25460	25469	25471	25472	his companion	1130	" At Bristol , in banks and places , "
25474	25478	25480	25481	the cook	916	" It were , "
25483	25545	25480	25481	the cook	916	" it were when we weighed anchor . But my old missis has it all by now . And the Spy - glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me . I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . "
25546	25554	25556	25557	the other	350	" And can you trust your missis ? "
25559	25564	25566	25567	the cook	916	" Gentlemen of fortune , "
25569	25740	25566	25567	the cook	916	" usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it . But I have a way with me , I have . When a mate brings a slip on his cable one as knows me , I mean it wo n't be in the same world with old John . There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me . Feared he was , and proud . They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them . Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers . Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . "
25741	25749	25751	25752	the lad	1134	" Well , I tell you now , "
25754	25783	25751	25752	the lad	1134	" I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . "
25784	25796	25798	25798	Silver	95	" And a brave lad you were , and smart too , "
25810	25827	25798	25798	Silver	95	" and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . "
25844	25848	25843	25847	a " gentleman of fortune	3266	" gentleman of fortune "
25920	25925	25927	25927	Silver	95	" Dick 's square , "
25929	25938	25927	25927	Silver	95	" Oh , I know'd Dick was square , "
25949	25958	25946	25947	Israel Hands	112	" He 's no fool , is Dick . "
25967	25972	25973	25973	he	1065	" But look here , "
25977	26046	25973	25973	he	1065	" here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a - going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ? I 've had a'most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder ! I want to go into that cabin , I do . I want their pickles and wines , and that . "
26047	26050	26052	26052	Silver	95	" Israel , "
26054	26130	26052	26052	Silver	95	" your head ai n't much account , nor ever was . But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough . Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . "
26131	26143	26145	26146	the coxswain	1065	" Well , I do n't say no , do I ? "
26148	26162	26145	26146	the coxswain	1065	" What I say is , when ? That 's what I say . "
26163	26170	26172	26172	Silver	95	" When ! By the powers ! "
26174	26310	26172	26172	Silver	95	" Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when . The last moment I can manage , and that 's when . Here 's a first - rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us . Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such I do n't know where it is , do I ? No more do you , says you . Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers . Then we 'll see . If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half - way back again before I struck . "
26311	26325	26327	26329	the lad Dick	1142	" Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , "
26331	26341	26343	26343	Silver	95	" We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , "
26345	26466	26343	26343	Silver	95	" We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ? That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last . If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day . But I know the sort you are . I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is . But you 're never happy till you 're drunk . Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! "
26467	26474	26476	26476	Israel	112	" Easy all , Long John , "
26478	26488	26476	26476	Israel	112	" Who 's a - crossin ' of you ? "
26489	26521	26523	26523	Silver	95	" Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ? And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? "
26525	26597	26523	26523	Silver	95	" And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry . You hear me ? I seen a thing or two at sea , I have . If you would on'y lay your course , and a p'int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would . But not you ! I know you . You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . "
26598	26625	26627	26627	Israel	112	" Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , "
26629	26662	26627	26627	Israel	112	" They liked a bit o ' fun , they did . They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . "
26663	26666	26668	26668	Silver	95	" So ? "
26670	26720	26668	26668	Silver	95	" Well , and where are they now ? Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar - man . Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah . Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was ! On'y , where are they ? "
26721	26724	26726	26726	Dick	121	" But , "
26728	26746	26726	26726	Dick	121	" when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? "
26747	26755	26757	26758	the cook	916	" There 's the man for me ! "
26761	26811	26757	26758	the cook	916	" That 's what I call business . Well , what would you think ? Put 'em ashore like maroons ? That would have been England 's way . Or cut 'em down like that much pork ? That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . "
26812	26820	26822	26822	Israel	112	" Billy was the man for that , "
26824	26868	26822	26822	Israel	112	" ' Dead men do n't bite , ' says he . Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . "
26869	26874	26876	26876	Silver	95	" Right you are , "
26878	26977	26876	26876	Silver	95	" rough and ready . But mark you here , I 'm an easy man I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious . Dooty is dooty , mates . I give my vote death . When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea - lawyers in the cabin a - coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers . Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! "
26978	26981	26983	26984	the coxswain	1065	" John , "
26986	26992	27006	27006	Silver	95	" you 're a man ! "
26993	27004	27006	27006	Silver	95	" You 'll say so , Israel when you see , "
27008	27034	27035	27035	he	95	" Only one thing I claim I claim Trelawney . I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! "
27041	27064	27035	27035	he	95	" You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . "
27120	27146	27117	27117	Hands	112	" Oh , stow that ! Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John . Let 's have a go of the rum . "
27147	27150	27152	27152	Silver	95	" Dick , "
27154	27183	27152	27152	Silver	95	" I trust you . I 've a gauge on the keg , mind . There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . "
27271	27279	27323	27323	himself	95	" Not another man of them'll jine . "
27305	27309	27323	27323	himself	95	" To luck , "
27313	27320	27323	27323	himself	95	" Here 's to old Flint , "
27332	27351	27323	27323	himself	95	" Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . "
27407	27411	27403	27404	the lookout	1150	" Land ho ! "
27625	27631	27633	27634	the captain	234	" And now , men , "
27642	27654	27633	27634	the captain	234	" has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? "
27655	27661	27663	27663	Silver	95	" I have , sir , "
27665	27678	27663	27663	Silver	95	" I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . "
27679	27694	27696	27697	the captain	234	" The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? "
27699	27816	27696	27697	the captain	234	" Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it . It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it . That hill to the nor'ard they calls the Fore - mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south'ard fore , main , and mizzen , sir . But the main that 's the big un , with the cloud on it they usually calls the Spy - glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . "
27817	27824	27826	27827	Captain Smollett	108	" I have a chart here , "
27829	27837	27826	27827	Captain Smollett	108	" See if that 's the place . "
27926	27931	27933	27933	he	95	" Yes , sir , "
27935	28015	28017	28017	he	95	" this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out . Who might have done that , I wonder ? The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon . Aye , here it is : ' Capt . Kidd 's Anchorage ' just the name my shipmate called it . There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor'ard up the west coast . Right you was , sir , "
28019	28058	28017	28017	he	95	" to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island . Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . "
28059	28066	28068	28069	Captain Smollett	108	" Thank you , my man , "
28071	28088	28068	28069	Captain Smollett	108	" I 'll ask you later on to give us a help . You may go . "
28177	28180	28182	28182	he	95	" Ah , "
28184	28306	28182	28182	he	95	" this here is a sweet spot , this island a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on . You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself . Why , it makes me young again . I was going to forget my timber leg , I was . It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that . When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . "
28427	28459	28423	28423	I	0	" Doctor , let me speak . Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me . I have terrible news . "
28476	28482	28484	28484	he	289	" Thank you , Jim , "
28488	28497	28484	28484	he	289	" that was all I wanted to know , "
28583	28587	28589	28590	Captain Smollett	108	" My lads , "
28592	28749	28589	28590	Captain Smollett	108	" I 've a word to say to you . This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for . Mr. Trelawney , being a very open - handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck . I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome . And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea - cheer for the gentleman that does it . "
28784	28792	28794	28795	Long John	95	" One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , "
28915	28920	28922	28923	the squire	661	" Now , Hawkins , "
28925	28935	28922	28923	the squire	661	" you have something to say . Speak up . "
28998	29001	28986	28986	they	1178	" Jim , "
29006	29011	28986	28986	they	1178	" take a seat . "
29069	29074	29076	29077	the squire	661	" Now , captain , "
29079	29101	29076	29077	the squire	661	" you were right , and I was wrong . I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . "
29102	29112	29114	29115	the captain	234	" No more an ass than I , sir , "
29117	29157	29158	29158	he	661	" I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according . But this crew , "
29161	29165	29158	29158	he	661	" beats me . "
29166	29169	29171	29172	the doctor	289	" Captain , "
29174	29188	29171	29172	the doctor	289	" with your permission , that 's Silver . A very remarkable man . "
29189	29203	29205	29206	the captain	234	" He 'd look remarkably well from a yard - arm , sir , "
29208	29240	29171	29172	the doctor	289	" But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything . I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . "
29241	29257	29259	29260	Mr. Trelawney	86	" You , sir , are the captain . It is for you to speak , "
29263	29267	29269	29270	Mr. Smollett	125	" First point , "
29272	29386	29269	29270	Mr. Smollett	125	" We must go on , because we ca n't turn back . If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once . Second point , we have time before us at least until this treasure 's found . Third point , there are faithful hands . Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it . We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? "
29387	29392	29394	29395	the squire	661	" As upon myself , "
29397	29400	29402	29403	the captain	234	" Three , "
29405	29421	29402	29403	the captain	234	" ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here . Now , about the honest hands ? "
29422	29430	29432	29433	the doctor	289	" Most likely Trelawney 's own men , "
29435	29449	29432	29433	the doctor	289	" those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . "
29450	29453	29455	29456	the squire	661	" Nay , "
29458	29465	29455	29456	the squire	661	" Hands was one of mine . "
29466	29476	29478	29479	the captain	234	" I did think I could have trusted Hands , "
29481	29491	29494	29495	the squire	661	" And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! "
29497	29513	29494	29495	the squire	661	" Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . "
29514	29519	29521	29522	the captain	234	" Well , gentlemen , "
29524	29596	29521	29522	the captain	234	" the best that I can say is not much . We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout . It 's trying on a man , I know . It would be pleasanter to come to blows . But there 's no help for it till we know our men . Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . "
29597	29601	29603	29604	the doctor	289	" Jim here , "
29606	29629	29603	29604	the doctor	289	" can help us more than anyone . The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . "
29630	29640	29642	29643	the squire	661	" Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , "
30264	30267	30268	30268	he	111	" Well , "
30274	30280	30268	30268	he	111	" it 's not forever . "
30370	30380	30381	30381	he	95	" There 's a strong scour with the ebb , "
30384	30404	30381	30381	he	95	" and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . "
30682	30690	30691	30691	he	289	" I do n't know about treasure , "
30694	30706	30691	30691	he	289	" but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . "
30871	30878	30892	30892	he	95	" Aye , aye , sir ! "
30941	30944	30946	30947	the captain	234	" Sir , "
30949	31032	30946	30947	the captain	234	" if I risk another order , the whole ship'll come about our ears by the run . You see , sir , here it is . I get a rough answer , do I not ? Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up . Now , we 've only one man to rely on . "
31033	31039	31041	31042	the squire	661	" And who is that ? "
31044	31049	31051	31052	the captain	234	" Silver , sir , "
31054	31163	31051	31052	the captain	234	" he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up . This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance . Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore . If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship . If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right . If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . "
31220	31224	31226	31226	he	234	" My lads , "
31228	31286	31226	31226	he	234	" we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts . A turn ashore'll hurt nobody the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon . I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . "
31676	31688	31663	31664	No one	411	" Is that you , Jim ? Keep your head down . "
31797	31802	31805	31805	him	1310	" Jim , Jim ! "
32663	32666	32667	32667	he	95	" Mate , "
32671	32764	32667	32667	he	95	" it 's because I thinks gold dust of you gold dust , and you may lay to that ! If I had n't took to you like pitch , do you think I 'd have been here a - warning of you ? All 's up you ca n't make nor mend ; it 's to save your neck that I 'm a - speaking , and if one of the wild uns knew it , where 'd I be , Tom now , tell me , where 'd I be ? "
32765	32768	32770	32772	the other man	1348	" Silver , "
32803	32806	32808	32808	he	95	" Silver , "
32810	32895	32808	32808	he	95	" you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook . And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ? Not you ! As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand . If I turn agin my dooty "
33092	33095	33097	33098	the sailor	523	" John ! "
33105	33109	33111	33111	Silver	95	" Hands off ! "
33134	33145	33147	33148	the other	350	" Hands off , if you like , John Silver , "
33150	33177	33147	33148	the other	350	" It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me . But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? "
33178	33181	33183	33183	Silver	95	" That ? "
33213	33225	33193	33193	his	95	" That ? Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . "
33237	33240	33241	33241	he	91	" Alan ! "
33244	33315	33241	33241	he	91	" Then rest his soul for a true seaman ! And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more . If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty . You 've killed Alan , have you ? Kill me too , if you can . But I defies you . "
34603	34608	34609	34609	I	0	" Who are you ? "
34612	34616	34617	34617	he	1404	" Ben Gunn , "
34633	34655	34621	34621	his	1404	" I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . "
34801	34805	34806	34806	I	0	" Three years ! "
34809	34814	34806	34806	I	0	" Were you shipwrecked ? "
34815	34820	34822	34822	he	1404	" Nay , mate , "
34824	34827	34822	34822	he	1404	" marooned . "
34874	34880	34881	34881	he	1404	" Marooned three years agone , "
34884	34967	34881	34881	he	1404	" and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters . Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself . But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet . You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ? No ? Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese toasted , mostly and woke up again , and here I were . "
34968	34977	34979	34979	I	0	" If ever I can get aboard again , "
34981	34990	34979	34979	I	0	" you shall have cheese by the stone . "

35066	35077	35063	35063	he	1404	" Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? "
35078	35085	35087	35087	my	0	" Not you , I know , "
35090	35096	35097	35097	he	1404	" And right you was , "
35100	35111	35097	35097	he	1404	" Now you what do you call yourself , mate ? "

35133	35174	35175	35175	he	1404	" Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of . Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother to look at me ? "
35178	35187	35188	35188	I	0	" Why , no , not in particular , "
35191	35196	35198	35198	he	1404	" Ah , well , "
35200	35363	35198	35198	he	1404	" but I had remarkable pious . And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another . And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck - farthen on the blessed grave - stones ! That 's what it begun with , but it went further'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman ! But it were Providence that put me here . I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety . You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have . I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to . And , Jim "

35493	35510	35511	35511	he	1414	" Now , Jim , you tell me true : that ai n't Flint 's ship ? "
35540	35581	35534	35534	I	0	" It 's not Flint 's ship , and Flint is dead ; but I 'll tell you true , as you ask me there are some of Flint 's hands aboard ; worse luck for the rest of us . "
35582	35590	35591	35591	he	1414	" Not a man with one leg ? "

35648	35657	35658	35658	he	1414	" If you was sent by Long John , "
35661	35683	35658	35658	he	1414	" I 'm as good as pork , and I know it . But where was you , do you suppose ? "
35736	35745	35746	35746	he	1414	" You 're a good lad , Jim , "
35749	35815	35746	35746	he	1414	" and you 're all in a clove hitch , ai n't you ? Well , you just put your trust in Ben Gunn Ben Gunn 's the man to do it . Would you think it likely , now , that your squire would prove a liberal - minded one in case of help him being in a clove hitch , as you remark ? "
35828	35835	35837	35838	Ben Gunn	103	" Aye , but you see , "
35840	35905	35837	35838	Ben Gunn	103	" I did n't mean giving me a gate to keep , and a suit of livery clothes , and such ; that 's not my mark , Jim . What I mean is , would he be likely to come down to the toon of , say one thousand pounds out of money that 's as good as a man 's own already ? "
35906	35913	35915	35915	I.	0	" I am sure he would , "
35916	35927	35915	35915	I.	0	" As it was , all hands were to share . "
35928	35934	35935	35935	he	1414	" AND a passage home ? "
35944	35947	35935	35935	he	1414	" Why , "
35951	35980	35948	35948	I	0	" the squire 's a gentleman . And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . "
35981	35984	35986	35986	he	1414	" Ah , "
35993	36001	35986	35986	he	1414	" And he seemed very much relieved . "
36010	36015	36004	36004	I	0	" he went on . "
36227	36360	36224	36224	he	113	" Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island . ' Boys , ' said I , ' here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . ' The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed . Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard . ' As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ' here 's a musket , ' they says , ' and a spade , and pick - axe . You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says . "
36421	36432	36418	36418	I	0	" And with that he winked and pinched me hard . "
36444	36449	36434	36434	you	70	" he went on . "
36552	36564	36541	36541	you	70	" And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner . "
36567	36571	36573	36573	you	70	" he continued , "
36622	36623	36593	36593	he	103	" "
36626	36630	36593	36593	he	103	" I said , "
36660	36661	36638	36638	you	103	" "
36664	36668	36638	36638	you	103	" said he , "
36717	36722	36694	36694	her	1229	" he broke out . "
36727	36760	36694	36694	her	1229	" For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon . "
36767	36771	36694	36694	her	1229	" I cried . "
36775	36806	36694	36694	her	1229	" And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly . "
36811	36815	36694	36694	her	1229	" says he ; "
36869	36877	36878	36878	You	1448	" cemetery , he must have meant . "
36946	37008	36943	36943	you	1448	" So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer . The cannon - shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms . Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood .
37250	37253	37245	37247	One of them	3082	" Lillibullero . "

37886	37919	37879	37880	Captain Smollett	108	" new to this work . He came nigh - hand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry . Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us . "
38038	38042	38043	38043	he	1065	" Mr. Hands , "
38046	38077	38043	38043	he	1065	" here are two of us with a brace of pistols each . If any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man 's dead . "
38139	38144	38146	38147	the captain	234	" Down , dog ! "
38234	38236	38229	38230	the watchers	1536	" Lillibullero "

38718	38734	38744	38745	Mr. Smollett	125	" It 's to you , Abraham Gray it 's to you I am speaking . "
38739	38742	38744	38745	Mr. Smollett	125	" Gray , "
38751	38815	38744	38745	Mr. Smollett	125	" I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain . I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out . I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . "
38821	38828	38830	38831	the captain	234	" Come , my fine fellow , "
38833	38857	38830	38831	the captain	234	" do n't hang so long in stays . I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . "
38898	38906	38908	38908	he	133	" I 'm with you , sir , "
39201	39214	39216	39216	I	0	" I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , "
39239	39254	39264	39264	he	234	" The tide keeps washing her down . Could you pull a little stronger ? "
39255	39262	39264	39264	he	234	" Not without swamping the boat , "
39266	39286	39264	39264	he	234	" You must bear up , sir , if you please bear up until you see you 're gaining . "
39322	39332	39334	39334	I.	0	" We 'll never get ashore at this rate , "
39335	39355	39357	39358	the captain	234	" If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , "
39360	39371	39372	39372	he	234	" We must keep upstream . You see , sir , "
39376	39431	39372	39372	he	234	" if once we dropped to leeward of the landing - place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . "
39432	39441	39443	39454	the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore - sheets	1586	" The current 's less a'ready , sir , "
39456	39465	39443	39454	the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore - sheets	1586	" you can ease her off a bit . "
39466	39473	39475	39475	I	0	" Thank you , my man , "
39518	39522	39524	39524	he	234	" The gun ! "
39526	39533	39535	39535	I	0	" I have thought of that , "
39551	39574	39583	39584	the captain	234	" They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . "
39575	39581	39583	39584	the captain	234	" Look astern , doctor , "
39675	39682	39684	39684	Gray	133	" Israel was Flint 's gunner , "
39800	39807	39809	39810	the captain	234	" Who 's the best shot ? "
39812	39820	39822	39822	I.	0	" Mr. Trelawney , out and away , "
39823	39845	39847	39848	the captain	234	" Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ? Hands , if possible , "
39866	39869	39871	39872	the captain	234	" Now , "
39874	39900	39871	39872	the captain	234	" easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat . All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . "
40055	40063	40065	40065	I.	0	" Here come the gigs , sir , "
40066	40072	40074	40075	the captain	234	" Give way , then , "
40077	40099	40074	40075	the captain	234	" We must n't mind if we swamp her now . If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . "
40100	40112	40113	40113	I	0	" Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , "
40116	40133	40113	40113	I	0	" the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . "
40134	40144	40146	40147	the captain	234	" They 'll have a hot run , sir , "
40149	40198	40146	40147	the captain	234	" Jack ashore , you know . It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round - shot . Carpet bowls ! My lady 's maid could n't miss . Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . "
40310	40315	40317	40318	the captain	234	" If I durst , "
40320	40330	40317	40318	the captain	234	" I 'd stop and pick off another man . "
40372	40375	40377	40378	the squire	661	" Ready ! "
40380	40383	40385	40386	the captain	234	" Hold ! "
40859	40862	40864	40864	I	0	" Captain , "
40866	40883	40864	40864	I	0	" Trelawney is the dead shot . Give him your gun ; his own is useless . "
41401	41408	41409	41409	he	661	" Be I going , doctor ? "
41412	41418	41420	41420	I	0	" Tom , my man , "
41422	41428	41420	41420	I	0	" you 're going home . "
41429	41444	41445	41445	he	661	" I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first , "
41448	41451	41453	41454	the squire	661	" Tom , "
41466	41467	41458	41458	you	1658	" "
41481	41486	41475	41475	me	0	" was the answer . "
41495	41513	41453	41454	the squire	661	" After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer . "
41521	41720	41519	41519	sir	2853	" he added apologetically . And not long after , without another word , he passed away . In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log - book , and pounds of tobacco . He had found a longish fir - tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log - house where the trunks crossed and made an angle . Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours . This seemed mightily to relieve him . He re - entered the log - house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed . But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body . "
41729	41739	41727	41727	sir	2853	" he said , shaking the squire 's hand . "
41777	41784	41785	41786	Dr. Livesey	63	" Then he pulled me aside . "
41788	41792	41785	41786	Dr. Livesey	63	" he said , "
41805	41845	41802	41803	the consort	1675	" I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later . "
41852	41856	41846	41846	You	63	" I said . "
41861	41870	41846	41846	You	63	" returned the captain , scratching his head ; "
41895	41896	41899	41899	you	0	" "
41902	41906	41899	41899	you	0	" I asked . "
41926	41931	41923	41923	I	0	" replied the captain . "
41967	42012	41923	41923	I	0	" And he pointed to the dead body under the flag . Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round - shot passed high above the roof of the log - house and plumped far beyond us in the wood . "
42015	42020	41923	41923	I	0	" said the captain . "
42034	42064	42065	42065	Captain	2845	" At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage . "
42067	42072	42065	42065	Captain	2845	" said the squire , "
42102	42103	42105	42105	my	0	" "
42108	42113	42105	42105	my	0	" cried the captain . "
42120	42262	42119	42119	I	0	" ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him . For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade . All through the evening they kept thundering away . Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand . We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log - house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse - play and minded it no more than cricket . "
42272	42277	42119	42119	I	0	" observed the captain ; "
42310	42556	42557	42557	Somebody	3504	" Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward . Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission . The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery . For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current . Silver was in the stern - sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own . The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log - house in Treasure Island . Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin - boy And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate . A hail on the land side . "
42561	42570	42571	42571	Doctor	71	" said Hunter , who was on guard . "
42585	42612	42577	42577	Hullo	138	" came the cries . And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade .
42649	42652	42654	42654	he	103	" Now , "
42656	42665	42654	42654	he	103	" there 's your friends , sure enough . "
42666	42675	42676	42676	I	0	" Far more likely it 's the mutineers , "
42679	42682	42683	42683	he	103	" That ! "
42686	42804	42683	42683	he	103	" Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that . No , that 's your friends . There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint . Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint ! Barring rum , his match were never seen . He were afraid of none , not he ; on'y Silver Silver was that genteel . "
42805	42808	42810	42810	I	0	" Well , "
42812	42837	42683	42683	he	103	" that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . "
42838	42843	42845	42845	Ben	103	" Nay , mate , "
42847	42940	42942	42942	he	1696	" not you . You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on'y a boy , all told . Now , Ben Gunn is fly . Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going not rum would n't , till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour . And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight that 's what you 'll say , a precious sight more confidence ' and then nips him . "
42955	43024	42942	42942	he	1696	" And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim . Just wheer you found him today . And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone . Oh ! And you 'll say this : ' Ben Gunn , ' says you , ' has reasons of his own . ' "
43025	43028	43030	43030	I	0	" Well , "
43032	43070	43030	43030	I	0	" I believe I understand . You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you . Is that all ? "
43071	43078	43079	43079	he	1697	" And when ? says you , "
43082	43094	43079	43079	he	1697	" Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . "
43095	43098	43100	43100	I	0	" Good , "
43102	43109	43079	43079	he	1697	" and now may I go ? "
43110	43116	43117	43117	he	1697	" You wo n't forget ? "
43121	43153	43117	43117	he	1697	" Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you . Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man . Well , then "
43157	43223	43225	43225	he	0	" I reckon you can go , Jim . And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ? Wild horses would n't draw it from you ? No , says you . And if them pirates camp ashore , Jim , what would you say but there 'd be widders in the morning ? "
43851	43856	43858	43859	the captain	234	" to her bearings , "
44361	44366	44367	44367	he	289	" That man Smollett , "
44371	44392	44367	44367	he	289	" is a better man than I am . And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . "
44418	44426	44427	44427	he	289	" Is this Ben Gunn a man ? "
44430	44438	44440	44440	I.	0	" I do not know , sir , "
44441	44452	44440	44440	I.	0	" I am not very sure whether he 's sane . "
44453	44466	44468	44469	the doctor	289	" If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , "
44471	44520	44468	44469	the doctor	289	" A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me . It does n't lie in human nature . Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? "
44521	44528	44529	44529	I	0	" Yes , sir , cheese , "
44532	44537	44539	44539	he	289	" Well , Jim , "
44541	44608	44539	44539	he	289	" just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food . You 've seen my snuff - box , have n't you ? And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff - box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious . Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! "
44664	44674	44654	44654	he	289	" must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . "
44903	44906	44907	44907	he	289	" So , "

45239	45248	45250	45250	he	234	" Ten to one this is a trick . "

45361	45373	45374	45374	he	234	" And what do you want with your flag of truce ? "
45387	45401	45402	45402	he	1348	" Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , "
45405	45418	45420	45421	the captain	234	" Cap'n Silver ! Do n't know him . Who 's he ? "
45432	45446	45427	45427	him	234	" Cap'n , is it ? My heart , and here 's promotion ! "
45453	45471	45447	45448	Long John	95	" Me , sir . These poor lads have chosen me cap'n , after your desertion , sir "

45483	45540	45427	45427	him	234	" We 're willing to submit , if we can come to terms , and no bones about it . All I ask is your word , Cap'n Smollett , to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade , and one minute to get out o ' shot before a gun is fired . "
45541	45545	45547	45548	Captain Smollett	108	" My man , "
45550	45597	45547	45548	Captain Smollett	108	" I have not the slightest desire to talk to you . If you wish to talk to me , you can come , that 's all . If there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and the Lord help you . "
45598	45605	45607	45608	Long John	95	" That 's enough , cap'n , "
45611	45631	45607	45608	Long John	95	" A word from you 's enough . I know a gentleman , and you may lay to that . "
45808	45815	45805	45805	He	234	" Come , Lasses and Lads . "
45924	45932	45934	45935	the captain	234	" Here you are , my man , "
45941	45948	45938	45938	his	234	" You had better sit down . "
45949	45963	45965	45966	Long John	95	" You ai n't a - going to let me inside , cap'n ? "
45968	45989	45965	45966	Long John	95	" It 's a main cold morning , to be sure , sir , to sit outside upon the sand . "
45990	45995	45997	45998	the captain	234	" Why , Silver , "
46000	46056	45997	45998	the captain	234	" if you had pleased to be an honest man , you might have been sitting in your galley . It 's your own doing . You 're either my ship 's cook and then you were treated handsome or Cap'n Silver , a common mutineer and pirate , and then you can go hang ! "
46057	46064	46066	46069	the sea - cook	732	" Well , well , cap'n , "
46081	46148	46066	46069	the sea - cook	732	" you 'll have to give me a hand up again , that 's all . A sweet pretty place you have of it here . Ah , there 's Jim ! The top of the morning to you , Jim . Doctor , here 's my service . Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . "
46149	46164	46166	46167	the captain	234	" If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , "
46169	46177	46179	46179	Silver	141	" Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , "
46181	46363	46179	46179	Silver	141	" Dooty is dooty , to be sure . Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night . I do n't deny it was a good lay . Some of you pretty handy with a handspike - end . And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms . But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder ! We 'll have to do sentry - go and ease off a point or so on the rum . Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye . But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on'y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would . He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . "
46364	46367	46369	46370	Captain Smollett	108	" Well ? "
46458	46465	46467	46467	Silver	141	" Well , here it is , "
46469	46511	46467	46467	Silver	141	" We want that treasure , and we 'll have it that 's our point ! You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours . You have a chart , have n't you ? "
46512	46519	46521	46522	the captain	234	" That 's as may be , "
46524	46536	46521	46522	the captain	234	" Oh , well , you have , I know that , "
46541	46590	46521	46522	the captain	234	" You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it . What I mean is , we want your chart . Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . "
46591	46602	46604	46605	the captain	234	" That wo n't do with me , my man , "
46607	46635	46604	46605	the captain	234	" We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . "
46650	46654	46637	46638	the captain	234	" If Abe Gray "
46659	46663	46665	46666	Mr. Smollett	125	" Avast there ! "
46668	46719	46665	46666	Mr. Smollett	125	" Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first . So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . "
46745	46749	46751	46751	he	95	" Like enough , "
46753	46799	46751	46751	he	95	" I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were . And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . "
46851	46854	46856	46856	Silver	95	" Now , "
46858	47032	47034	47034	his	1809	" here it is . You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep . You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice . Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy - davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore . Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can . We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy - davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up . Now , you 'll own that 's talking . Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you . And I hope "
47036	47061	47034	47034	his	1809	" that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . "
47084	47089	47090	47090	he	108	" Is that all ? "
47093	47101	47103	47103	John	95	" Every last word , by thunder ! "
47105	47122	47103	47103	John	95	" Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket - balls . "
47123	47127	47129	47130	the captain	234	" Very good , "
47132	47325	47129	47130	the captain	234	" Now you 'll hear me . If you 'll come up one by one , unarmed , I 'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England . If you wo n't , my name is Alexander Smollett , I 've flown my sovereign 's colours , and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones . You ca n't find the treasure . You ca n't sail the ship there 's not a man among you fit to sail the ship . You ca n't fight us Gray , there , got away from five of you . Your ship 's in irons , Master Silver ; you 're on a lee shore , and so you 'll find . I stand here and tell you so ; and they 're the last good words you 'll get from me , for in the name of heaven , I 'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you . Tramp , my lad . Bundle out of this , please , hand over hand , and double quick . "
47351	47358	47359	47359	he	101	" Give me a hand up ! "
47362	47366	47368	47369	the captain	234	" Not I , "
47371	47380	47381	47381	he	101	" Who 'll give me a hand up ? "
47424	47427	47428	47428	he	101	" There ! "
47431	47487	47428	47428	he	101	" That 's what I think of ye . Before an hour 's out , I 'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon . Laugh , by thunder , laugh ! Before an hour 's out , ye'll laugh upon the other side . Them that die'll be the lucky ones . "
47584	47587	47588	47588	he	133	" Quarters ! "
47603	47606	47607	47607	he	133	" Gray , "
47610	47673	47607	47607	he	133	" I 'll put your name in the log ; you 've stood by your duty like a seaman . Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir . Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat ! If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . "
47732	47736	47738	47738	he	234	" My lads , "
47740	47820	47729	47729	he	234	" I 've given Silver a broadside . I pitched it in red - hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded . We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline . I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . "
47942	47948	47950	47951	the captain	234	" Toss out the fire , "
47953	47969	47950	47951	the captain	234	" the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . "
47990	48012	48014	48015	Captain Smollett	108	" Hawkins has n't had his breakfast . Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , "
48017	48046	48014	48015	Captain Smollett	108	" Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done . Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . "
48069	48078	48079	48079	he	234	" Doctor , you will take the door , "
48082	48198	48079	48079	he	234	" See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch . Hunter , take the east side , there . Joyce , you stand by the west , my man . Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is . If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty . Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . "
48301	48305	48307	48308	the captain	234	" Hang them ! "
48310	48326	48307	48308	the captain	234	" This is as dull as the doldrums . Gray , whistle for a wind . "
48340	48347	48349	48349	Joyce	92	" If you please , sir , "
48351	48362	48349	48349	Joyce	92	" if I see anyone , am I to fire ? "
48363	48369	48371	48372	the captain	234	" I told you so ! "
48374	48380	48382	48382	Joyce	92	" Thank you , sir , "
48550	48557	48559	48560	the captain	234	" Did you hit your man ? "
48562	48567	48569	48569	Joyce	92	" No , sir , "
48571	48578	48569	48569	Joyce	92	" I believe not , sir . "
48579	48588	48590	48591	Captain Smollett	108	" Next best thing to tell the truth , "
48593	48612	48590	48591	Captain Smollett	108	" Load his gun , Hawkins . How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? "
48613	48618	48620	48621	Dr. Livesey	63	" I know precisely , "
48623	48646	48620	48621	Dr. Livesey	63	" Three shots were fired on this side . I saw the three flashes two close together one farther to the west . "
48647	48650	48652	48653	the captain	234	" Three ! "
48655	48665	48652	48653	the captain	234	" And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? "
49052	49061	49062	49062	he	1883	" At 'em , all hands all hands ! "
49211	49227	49229	49230	the captain	234	" Out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open ! Cutlasses ! "
49325	49336	49338	49339	the captain	234	" Round the house , lads ! Round the house ! "
49679	49686	49688	49689	the doctor	289	" Fire fire from the house ! "
49691	49701	49688	49689	the doctor	289	" And you , lads , back into cover . "
49860	49866	49868	49869	Mr. Trelawney	86	" The captain 's wounded , "
49871	49876	49878	49879	Mr. Smollett	125	" Have they run ? "
49881	49891	49893	49894	the doctor	289	" All that could , you may be bound , "
49896	49908	49893	49894	the doctor	289	" but there 's five of them will never run again . "
49909	49912	49914	49915	the captain	234	" Five ! "
49917	49963	49914	49915	the captain	234	" Come , that 's better . Five against three leaves us four to nine . That 's better odds than we had at starting . We were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that 's as bad to bear . "
50039	50047	50037	50037	They	1384	" got their rations for that day , "
50502	50512	50514	50514	he	133	" Why , in the name of Davy Jones , "
50516	50522	50514	50514	he	133	" is Dr. Livesey mad ? "
50523	50527	50529	50529	I.	0	" Why no , "
50530	50546	50529	50529	I.	0	" He 's about the last of this crew for that , I take it . "

50556	50577	50554	50554	Gray	133	" mad he may not be ; but if HE 'S not , you mark my words , I am . "
50578	50583	50585	50585	I	0	" I take it , "
50587	50609	50585	50585	I	0	" the doctor has his idea ; and if I am right , he 's going now to see Ben Gunn . "

55157	55206	55153	55153	I	0	" it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance ; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time , in smooth places , give her a shove or two towards land . "

57623	57672	57673	57673	he	109	" I 'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but I do n't have no manner of luck , you see , and that 's what 's the matter with me . As for that swab , he 's good and dead , he is , "

Well , HE 'S dead now , he is as dead as bilge ; and who 's to sail this ship , I do n't see . Without I gives you a hint , you ai n't that man , as far 's I can tell . Now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and I 'll tell you how to sail her , and that 's about square all round , I take it . "

North Inlet ? Why , I have n't no ch'ice , not I ! I 'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock , by thunder ! So I would . "

I never seen sich dirty luck , not I. There was this here O'Brien now he 's dead , ai n't he ? Well now , I 'm no scholar , and you 're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ? "
58917	58938	58939	58939	I	0	" You can kill the body , Mr. Hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , "
58942	58956	58939	58939	I	0	" O'Brien there is in another world , and may be watching us . "
58957	58960	58962	58962	he	2215	" Ah ! "
58964	59072	58962	58962	he	2215	" Well , that 's unfort'nate appears as if killing parties was a waste of time . Howsomever , sperrits do n't reckon for much , by what I 've seen . I 'll chance it with the sperrits , Jim . And now , you 've spoke up free , and I 'll take it kind if you 'd step down into that there cabin and get me a well , a shiver my timbers ! I ca n't hit the name on ' t ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , Jim this here brandy 's too strong for my head . "
59234	59238	59239	59239	I	0	" Some wine ? "
59242	59253	59239	59239	I	0	" Far better . Will you have white or red ? "
59254	59270	59271	59271	he	2215	" Well , I reckon it 's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , "
59290	59291	59239	59239	I	0	" "
59295	59299	59239	59239	I	0	" I answered . "
59318	59839	59310	59310	I	0	" With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion . I knew he would not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true . He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved for I could hear him stifle a groan yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck . In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood . He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark . This was all that I required to know . Israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that I was meant to be the victim . What he would do afterwards whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him was , of course , more than I could say . Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner . We both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared . While I was thus turning the business over in my mind , I had not been idle with my body . I had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , I made my reappearance on the deck . Hands lay as I had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light . He looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of "
59844	59871	59310	59310	I	0	" Then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid . "
59880	59884	59310	59310	I	0	" says he , "
59940	59941	59929	59929	I	0	" "
59944	59948	59929	59929	I	0	" said I , "
59978	59979	59967	59967	I	0	" "
59982	59986	59967	59967	I	0	" said he . "
59994	59995	59989	59989	you	3213	" "
59998	60002	60003	60003	You	3213	" I cried . "
60060	60113	60053	60054	Mr. Hands	109	" I spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with . He , for his part , took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity . "
60118	60122	60053	60054	Mr. Hands	109	" he said , "
60202	60211	60198	60198	you	2225	" he added , suddenly changing his tone , "
60251	60492	60240	60240	we	2229	" All told , we had scarce two miles to run ; but the navigation was delicate , the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal , but lay east and west , so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in . I think I was a good , prompt subaltern , and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot , for we went about and about and dodged in , shaving the banks , with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold . Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us . The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage , but the space was longer and narrower and more like , what in truth it was , the estuary of a river . Right before us , at the southern end , we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation . It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed , and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers . It was a sad sight , but it showed us that the anchorage was calm . "
60495	60499	60240	60240	we	2229	" said Hands , "
60544	60545	60240	60240	we	2229	" "
60550	60554	60240	60240	we	2229	" I inquired , "
60563	60564	60240	60240	we	2229	" "
60569	60573	60574	60574	you	2233	" he replied : "
60676	60698	60631	60631	she	2231	" So he issued his commands , which I breathlessly obeyed , till , all of a sudden , he cried , "
60706	61840	60631	60631	she	2231	" And I put the helm hard up , and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low , wooded shore . The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto , sharply enough , upon the coxswain . Even then I was still so much interested , waiting for the ship to touch , that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows . I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head . Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye ; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat 's ; but , sure enough , when I looked round , there was Hands , already half - way towards me , with the dirk in his right hand . We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully 's . At the same instant , he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows . As I did so , I let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and I think this saved my life , for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment , dead . Before he could recover , I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped , with all the deck to dodge about . Just forward of the main - mast I stopped , drew a pistol from my pocket , took a cool aim , though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me , and drew the trigger . The hammer fell , but there followed neither flash nor sound ; the priming was useless with sea - water . I cursed myself for my neglect . Why had not I , long before , reprimed and reloaded my only weapons ? Then I should not have been as now , a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher . Wounded as he was , it was wonderful how fast he could move , his grizzled hair tumbling over his face , and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury . I had no time to try my other pistol , nor indeed much inclination , for I was sure it would be useless . One thing I saw plainly : I must not simply retreat before him , or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows , as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern . Once so caught , and nine or ten inches of the blood - stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity . I placed my palms against the main - mast , which was of a goodish bigness , and waited , every nerve upon the stretch . Seeing that I meant to dodge , he also paused ; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine . It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove , but never before , you may be sure , with such a wildly beating heart as now . Still , as I say , it was a boy 's game , and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh . Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair , and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long , I saw no hope of any ultimate escape . Well , while things stood thus , suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck , staggered , ground for an instant in the sand , and then , swift as a blow , canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty - five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay , in a pool , between the deck and bulwark . We were both of us capsized in a second , and both of us rolled , almost together , into the scuppers , the dead red - cap , with his arms still spread out , tumbling stiffly after us . So near were we , indeed , that my head came against the coxswain 's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle . Blow and all , I was the first afoot again , for Hands had got involved with the dead body . The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on ; I had to find some new way of escape , and that upon the instant , for my foe was almost touching me . Quick as thought , I sprang into the mizzen shrouds , rattled up hand over hand , and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross - trees . I had been saved by being prompt ; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight ; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine , a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment . Now that I had a moment to myself , I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol , and then , having one ready for service , and to make assurance doubly sure , I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning . My new employment struck Hands all of a heap ; he began to see the dice going against him , and after an obvious hesitation , he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds , and with the dirk in his teeth , began slowly and painfully to mount . It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him , and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up . Then , with a pistol in either hand , I addressed him . "
61848	61852	61845	61846	Mr. Hands	109	" said I , "
61870	61963	61964	61964	Jim	70	" I added with a chuckle . He stopped instantly . I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think , and the process was so slow and laborious that , in my new - found security , I laughed aloud . At last , with a swallow or two , he spoke , his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity . In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth , but in all else he remained unmoved . "
61966	61970	61964	61964	Jim	70	" says he , "
62041	62178	62039	62039	Jim	70	" I was drinking in his words and smiling away , as conceited as a cock upon a wall , when , all in a breath , back went his right hand over his shoulder . Something sang like an arrow through the air ; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang , and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast . In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment I scarce can say it was by my own volition , and I am sure it was without a conscious aim both my pistols went off , and both escaped out of my hands . They did not fall alone ; with a choked cry , the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water .
62180	62184	62024	62024	you	70	" Pieces of Eight "
64246	64251	64283	64283	Silver	148	" All 's well , "

64993	65004	65006	65006	he	2325	" Give me a loan of the link , Dick , "
65018	65025	65026	65026	he	2325	" That 'll do , lad , "

65115	65190	65193	65193	you	2328	" To all this , as may be well supposed , I made no answer . They had set me with my back against the wall , and I stood there , looking Silver in the face , pluckily enough , I hope , to all outward appearance , but with black despair in my heart . Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again . "
65205	65209	65210	65210	I	0	" says he , "
65394	65444	65445	65445	I	0	" So far so good . My friends , then , were still alive , and though I partly believed the truth of Silver 's statement , that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion , I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard . "

65592	65596	65590	65590	Lad	154	" said Silver , "

65723	65745	65720	65721	my friend	969	" cried Silver truculently to this speaker . And then , in his first gracious tones , he replied to me , "
65752	65756	65749	65750	Mr. Hawkins	153	" said he , "
65942	65951	65933	65933	I	0	" He drew again quietly at his pipe . "
65964	65969	65962	65962	yours	141	" he went on , "
66059	66064	66065	66065	I	0	" Is that all ? "
66068	66083	66085	66085	Silver	141	" Well , it 's all that you 're to hear , my son , "
66087	66095	66085	66085	Silver	141	" And now I am to choose ? "
66096	66111	66113	66113	Silver	141	" And now you are to choose , and you may lay to that , "
66115	66118	66120	66120	I	0	" Well , "
66122	66181	66182	66182	I	0	" I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for . Let the worst come to the worst , it 's little I care . I 've seen too many die since I fell in with you . But there 's a thing or two I have to tell you , "
66194	66444	66189	66189	I	0	" and the first is this : here you are , in a bad way ship lost , treasure lost , men lost , your whole business gone to wreck ; and if you want to know who did it it was I ! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land , and I heard you , John , and you , Dick Johnson , and Hands , who is now at the bottom of the sea , and told every word you said before the hour was out . And as for the schooner , it was I who cut her cable , and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her , and it was I who brought her where you 'll never see her more , not one of you . The laugh 's on my side ; I 've had the top of this business from the first ; I no more fear you than I fear a fly . Kill me , if you please , or spare me . But one thing I 'll say , and no more ; if you spare me , bygones are bygones , and when you fellows are in court for piracy , I 'll save you all I can . It is for you to choose . Kill another and do yourselves no good , or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows . "
66495	66502	66503	66503	I	0	" And now , Mr. Silver , "
66506	66542	66503	66503	I	0	" I believe you 're the best man here , and if things go to the worst , I 'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it . "

66587	66595	66572	66572	he	101	" I 'll put one to that , "
66623	66632	66572	66572	he	101	" It was him that knowed Black Dog . "

66647	66684	66642	66645	the sea - cook	732	" I 'll put another again to that , by thunder ! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones . First and last , we 've split upon Jim Hawkins ! "
66685	66690	66692	66692	Morgan	104	" Then here goes ! "
66712	66717	66719	66719	Silver	95	" Avast , there ! "
66721	66825	66826	66826	Morgan	104	" Who are you , Tom Morgan ? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here , perhaps . By the powers , but I 'll teach you better ! Cross me , and you 'll go where many a good man 's gone before you , first and last , these thirty year back some to the yard - arm , shiver my timbers , and some by the board , and all to feed the fishes . There 's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards , Tom Morgan , you may lay to that . "

66915	67018	66906	66906	his	95	" Put a name on what you 're at ; you ai n't dumb , I reckon . Him that wants shall get it .

Well , I 'm ready . Take a cutlass , him that dares , and I 'll see the colour of his inside , crutch and all , before that pipe 's empty . "

You wo n't fight , as gentlemen o ' fortune should ; then , by thunder , you 'll obey , and you may lay to it ! I like that boy , now ; I never seen a better boy than that . He 's more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house , and what I say is this : let me see him that 'll lay a hand on him that 's what I say , and you may lay to it . "

But I see you was the right sort . I says to myself , you stand by Hawkins , John , and Hawkins'll stand by you . You 're his last card , and by the living thunder , John , he 's yours ! Back to back , says I. You save your witness , and he 'll save your neck ! "

68162	68192	68160	68160	he	2386	" I need a caulker , for there 's trouble on hand . And talking o ' trouble , why did that doctor give me the chart , Jim ? "
68209	68219	68221	68221	he	2386	" Ah , well , he did , though , "
68223	68245	68221	68221	he	2386	" And there 's something under that , no doubt something , surely , under that , Jim bad or good . "
68339	68348	68350	68350	Silver	95	" There 's a breeze coming , Jim , "
68529	68534	68536	68536	I	0	" Here they come , "
68560	68572	68574	68574	Silver	95	" Well , let 'em come , lad let 'em come , "
68577	68587	68574	68574	Silver	95	" I 've still a shot in my locker . "
68644	68650	68652	68652	Silver	95	" Step up , lad , "
68654	68682	68652	68652	Silver	95	" I wo n't eat you . Hand it over , lubber . I know the rules , I do ; I wo n't hurt a depytation . "
68727	68736	68737	68737	he	732	" The black spot ! I thought so , "
68740	68781	68737	68737	he	732	" Where might you have got the paper ? Why , hillo ! Look here , now ; this ai n't lucky ! You 've gone and cut this out of a Bible . What fool 's cut a Bible ? "
68782	68787	68789	68789	Morgan	104	" Ah , there ! "
68791	68809	68789	68789	Morgan	104	" There ! Wot did I say ? No good'll come o ' that , I said . "
68810	68823	68825	68825	Silver	95	" Well , you 've about fixed it now , among you , "
68827	68846	68854	68854	one	596	" You 'll all swing now , I reckon . What soft - headed lubber had a Bible ? "
68847	68852	68854	68854	one	596	" It was Dick , "
68856	68869	68871	68871	Silver	95	" Dick , was it ? Then Dick can get to prayers , "
68873	68892	68871	68871	Silver	95	" He 's seen his slice of luck , has Dick , and you may lay to that . "
68905	68913	68914	68914	he	2408	" Belay that talk , John Silver , "
68917	68958	68914	68914	he	2408	" This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council , as in dooty bound ; just you turn it over , as in dooty bound , and see what 's wrote there . Then you can talk . "
68959	68964	68966	68969	the sea - cook	732	" Thanky , George , "
68971	69081	68966	68969	the sea - cook	732	" You always was brisk for business , and has the rules by heart , George , as I 'm pleased to see . Well , what is it , anyway ? Ah ! ' Deposed ' that 's it , is it ? Very pretty wrote , to be sure ; like print , I swear . Your hand o ' write , George ? Why , you was gettin ' quite a leadin ' man in this here crew . You 'll be cap'n next , I should n't wonder . Just oblige me with that torch again , will you ? This pipe do n't draw . "
69082	69087	69089	69089	George	77	" Come , now , "
69091	69130	69089	69089	George	77	" you do n't fool this crew no more . You 're a funny man , by your account ; but you 're over now , and you 'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote . "
69131	69141	69143	69143	Silver	95	" I thought you said you knowed the rules , "
69146	69199	69143	69143	Silver	95	" Leastways , if you do n't , I do ; and I wait here and I 'm still your cap'n , mind till you outs with your grievances and I reply ; in the meantime , your black spot ai n't worth a biscuit . After that , we 'll see . "
69200	69203	69205	69205	George	77	" Oh , "
69207	69329	69205	69205	George	77	" you do n't be under no kind of apprehension ; WE'RE all square , we are . First , you 've made a hash of this cruise you 'll be a bold man to say no to that . Second , you let the enemy out o ' this here trap for nothing . Why did they want out ? I dunno , but it 's pretty plain they wanted it . Third , you would n't let us go at them upon the march . Oh , we see through you , John Silver ; you want to play booty , that 's what 's wrong with you . And then , fourth , there 's this here boy . "
69330	69335	69337	69337	Silver	95	" Is that all ? "
69340	69345	69347	69347	George	77	" Enough , too , "
69349	69362	69347	69347	George	77	" We 'll all swing and sun - dry for your bungling . "
69363	69596	69597	69597	Silver	95	" Well now , look here , I 'll answer these four p'ints ; one after another I 'll answer 'em . I made a hash o ' this cruise , did I ? Well now , you all know what I wanted , and you all know if that had been done that we 'd ' a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was , every man of us alive , and fit , and full of good plum - duff , and the treasure in the hold of her , by thunder ! Well , who crossed me ? Who forced my hand , as was the lawful cap'n ? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ? Ah , it 's a fine dance I 'm with you there and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope 's end at Execution Dock by London town , it does . But who done it ? Why , it was Anderson , and Hands , and you , George Merry ! And you 're the last above board of that same meddling crew ; and you have the Davy Jones 's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over me you , that sank the lot of us ! By the powers ! But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing . "
69623	69630	69632	69633	the accused	2411	" That 's for number one , "
69655	69710	69643	69643	he	2411	" Why , I give you my word , I 'm sick to speak to you . You 've neither sense nor memory , and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea . Sea ! Gentlemen o ' fortune ! I reckon tailors is your trade . "
69711	69717	69719	69719	Morgan	104	" Go on , John , "
69721	69728	69719	69719	Morgan	104	" Speak up to the others . "
69729	69735	69737	69737	John	95	" Ah , the others ! "
69739	70145	70147	70147	he	2413	" They 're a nice lot , ai n't they ? You say this cruise is bungled . Ah ! By gum , if you could understand how bad it 's bungled , you would see ! We 're that near the gibbet that my neck 's stiff with thinking on it . You 've seen 'em , maybe , hanged in chains , birds about 'em , seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide . ' Who 's that ? ' says one . ' That ! Why , that 's John Silver . I knowed him well , ' says another . And you can hear the chains a - jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy . Now , that 's about where we are , every mother 's son of us , thanks to him , and Hands , and Anderson , and other ruination fools of you . And if you want to know about number four , and that boy , why , shiver my timbers , is n't he a hostage ? Are we a - going to waste a hostage ? No , not us ; he might be our last chance , and I should n't wonder . Kill that boy ? Not me , mates ! And number three ? Ah , well , there 's a deal to say to number three . Maybe you do n't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day you , John , with your head broke or you , George Merry , that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone , and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock ? And maybe , perhaps , you did n't know there was a consort coming either ? But there is , and not so long till then ; and we 'll see who 'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that . And as for number two , and why I made a bargain well , you came crawling on your knees to me to make it on your knees you came , you was that downhearted and you 'd have starved too if I had n't but that 's a trifle ! You look there that 's why ! "
70292	70295	70297	70297	one	596	" Yes , "
70299	70327	70297	70297	one	596	" that 's Flint , sure enough . J. F. , and a score below , with a clove hitch to it ; so he done ever . "
70328	70332	70334	70334	George	156	" Mighty pretty , "
70336	70352	70334	70334	George	156	" But how are we to get away with it , and us no ship . "
70368	70377	70378	70378	he	95	" Now I give you warning , George , "
70381	70468	70378	70378	he	95	" One more word of your sauce , and I 'll call you down and fight you . How ? Why , how do I know ? You had ought to tell me that you and the rest , that lost me my schooner , with your interference , burn you ! But not you , you ca n't ; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach . But civil you can speak , and shall , George Merry , you may lay to that . "
70469	70475	70477	70479	the old man	2420	" That 's fair enow , "
70482	70489	70491	70494	the sea - cook	732	" Fair ! I reckon so , "
70496	70539	70491	70494	the sea - cook	732	" You lost the ship ; I found the treasure . Who 's the better man at that ? And now I resign , by thunder ! Elect whom you please to be your cap'n now ; I 'm done with it . "
70540	70543	70544	70544	they	2422	" Silver ! "
70547	70555	70544	70544	they	2422	" Barbecue forever ! Barbecue for cap'n ! "
70556	70566	70568	70569	the cook	916	" So that 's the toon , is it ? "
70571	70639	70568	70569	the cook	916	" George , I reckon you 'll have to wait another turn , friend ; and lucky for you as I 'm not a revengeful man . But that was never my way . And now , shipmates , this black spot ? ' Tain't much good now , is it ? Dick 's crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible , and that 's about all . "
70640	70655	70657	70657	Dick	121	" It 'll do to kiss the book on still , wo n't it ? "
70672	70681	70657	70657	Dick	121	" A Bible with a bit cut out ! "
70686	70701	70657	70657	Dick	121	" Not it . It do n't bind no more'n a ballad - book . "
70702	70709	70711	70711	Dick	121	" Do n't it , though ? "
70718	70729	70711	70711	Dick	121	" Well , I reckon that 's worth having too . "
70730	70741	70743	70743	Silver	95	" Here , Jim here 's a cur'osity for you , "
70799	70806	70796	70796	my	0	" Without are dogs and murderers . "
70842	70845	70846	70846	I	0	" Depposed . "
71098	71104	71071	71071	himself	2429	" Block house , ahoy ! "
71108	71114	71116	71117	the doctor	289	" Here 's the doctor . "
71221	71236	71238	71238	Silver	95	" You , doctor ! Top o ' the morning to you , sir ! "
71251	71310	71238	71238	Silver	95	" Bright and early , to be sure ; and it 's the early bird , as the saying goes , that gets the rations . George , shake up your timbers , son , and help Dr. Livesey over the ship 's side . All a - doin' well , your patients was all well and merry . "
71349	71361	71362	71362	he	95	" We 've quite a surprise for you too , sir , "
71365	71415	71362	71362	he	95	" We 've a little stranger here he ! he ! A noo boarder and lodger , sir , and looking fit and taut as a fiddle ; slep ' like a supercargo , he did , right alongside of John stem to stem we was , all night . "
71444	71448	71441	71441	he	63	" Not Jim ? "
71449	71458	71460	71460	Silver	95	" The very same Jim as ever was , "
71486	71491	71492	71492	he	289	" Well , well , "
71497	71521	71492	71492	he	289	" duty first and pleasure afterwards , as you might have said yourself , Silver . Let us overhaul these patients of yours . "
71632	71641	71642	71642	he	289	" You 're doing well , my friend , "
71652	71717	71642	71642	he	289	" and if ever any person had a close shave , it was you ; your head must be as hard as iron . Well , George , how goes it ? You 're a pretty colour , certainly ; why , your liver , man , is upside down . Did you take that medicine ? Did he take that medicine , men ? "
71718	71732	71734	71734	Morgan	104	" Aye , aye , sir , he took it , sure enough , "
71736	71759	71764	71764	his	71	" Because , you see , since I am mutineers ' doctor , or prison doctor as I prefer to call it , "
71768	71792	71764	71764	his	71	" I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George God bless him ! and the gallows . "
71808	71817	71819	71819	one	596	" Dick do n't feel well , sir , "
71821	71826	71828	71829	the doctor	289	" Do n't he ? "
71831	71871	71828	71829	the doctor	289	" Well , step up here , Dick , and let me see your tongue . No , I should be surprised if he did ! The man 's tongue is fit to frighten the French . Another fever . "
71872	71877	71879	71879	Morgan	104	" Ah , there , "
71881	71888	71879	71879	Morgan	104	" that comed of sp'iling Bibles . "
71889	71901	71903	71904	the doctor	289	" That comes as you call it of being arrant asses , "
71906	72012	71903	71904	the doctor	289	" and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison , and the dry land from a vile , pestiferous slough . I think it most probable though of course it 's only an opinion that you 'll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems . Camp in a bog , would you ? Silver , I 'm surprised at you . You 're less of a fool than many , take you all round ; but you do n't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health . "
72015	72047	71879	71879	Morgan	104	" he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions , with really laughable humility , more like charity schoolchildren than blood - guilty mutineers and pirates "
72071	72118	72058	72058	I	0	" And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly . George Merry was at the door , spitting and spluttering over some bad - tasted medicine ; but at the first word of the doctor 's proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried "
72121	72134	72135	72137	Si - lence	160	" and swore . Silver struck the barrel with his open hand . "
72139	72151	72152	72152	Doctor	2886	" he roared and looked about him positively like a lion . "
72154	72163	72152	72152	Doctor	2886	" he went on in his usual tones , "
72258	72266	72269	72269	doctor	2886	" I readily gave the pledge required . "
72271	72275	72269	72269	doctor	2886	" said Silver , "
72328	72500	72325	72326	Cap'n Smollett	108	" The explosion of disapproval , which nothing but Silver 's black looks had restrained , broke out immediately the doctor had left the house . Silver was roundly accused of playing double of trying to make a separate peace for himself , of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims , and , in one word , of the identical , exact thing that he was doing . It seemed to me so obvious , in this case , that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger . But he was twice the man the rest were , and his last night 's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds . He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine , said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor , fluttered the chart in their faces , asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a - treasure - hunting . "
72506	72510	72325	72326	Cap'n Smollett	108	" he cried . "
72542	72582	72526	72526	I	0	" And then he bade them get the fire lit , and stalked out upon his crutch , with his hand on my shoulder , leaving them in a disarray , and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced . "
72589	72593	72585	72585	lad	3213	" he said . "
72612	72651	72652	72652	You	3213	" Very deliberately , then , did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade , and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped . "
72664	72668	72662	72662	doctor	2886	" says he , "
72786	72830	72760	72760	you	2886	" Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house ; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in , his voice trembled ; never was a soul more dead in earnest . "
72840	72845	72846	72846	Doctor	2886	" asked Dr. Livesey . "
72861	72868	72856	72856	I	0	" and he snapped his fingers . "
72967	73060	72948	72948	you	95	" So saying , he stepped back a little way , till he was out of earshot , and there sat down upon a tree - stump and began to whistle , spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight , sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire which they were busy rekindling and the house , from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast . "
73065	73071	73063	73063	Jim	70	" said the doctor sadly , "
73149	73160	73161	73161	Doctor	2886	" I will own that I here began to weep . "
73163	73167	73168	73168	you	2886	" I said , "
73230	73231	73232	73232	Jim	70	" "
73234	73246	73247	73247	Jim	70	" the doctor interrupted , and his voice was quite changed , "
73265	73266	73267	73267	Doctor	2886	" "
73269	73273	73274	73274	I	0	" said I , "
73279	73280	73276	73276	my	0	" "
73287	73291	73284	73284	I	0	" he cried . "
73349	73350	73324	73324	I	0	" "
73353	73357	73324	73324	I	0	" I replied ; "
73467	73468	73517	73517	you	2493	" "
73472	73493	73517	73517	you	2493	" exclaimed the doctor . Rapidly I described to him my adventures , and he heard me out in silence . "
73503	73511	73517	73517	you	2493	" he observed when I had done . "
73600	73604	73605	73605	Silver	95	" he cried . "
73616	73626	73607	73607	I	0	" he continued as the cook drew near again ; "
73639	73640	73607	73607	I	0	" "
73655	73659	73645	73645	I	0	" said Silver . "
73688	73689	73682	73682	you	2853	" "
73694	73699	73692	73692	Silver	95	" replied the doctor , "
73721	73722	73723	73723	Sir	2853	" "
73725	73729	73723	73723	Sir	2853	" said Silver , "
73822	73823	73816	73816	I	0	" "
73826	73832	73816	73816	I	0	" said the doctor musingly ; "
73938	73945	73946	73946	You	95	" Silver 's face was radiant . "
73965	73969	73960	73960	you	95	" he cried . "
73978	73983	73984	73984	My	0	" added the doctor . "
74034	74060	74032	74032	Jim	70	" And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade , nodded to Silver , and set off at a brisk pace into the wood .
74069	74072	74074	74074	Silver	95	" JIM , "
74080	74214	74074	74074	Silver	95	" if I saved your life , you saved mine ; and I 'll not forget it . I seen the doctor waving you to run for it with the tail of my eye , I did ; and I seen you say no , as plain as hearing . Jim , that 's one to you . This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed , and I owe it you . And now , Jim , we 're to go in for this here treasure - hunting , with sealed orders too , and I do n't like it ; and you and me must stick close , back to back like , and we 'll save our necks in spite o ' fate and fortune . "
74439	74444	74446	74446	he	74	" Aye , mates , "
74448	74528	74446	74446	he	74	" it 's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head . I got what I wanted , I did . Sure enough , they have the ship . Where they have it , I do n't know yet ; but once we hit the treasure , we 'll have to jump about and find out . And then , mates , us that has the boats , I reckon , has the upper hand . "
74567	74572	74573	74573	he	74	" As for hostage , "
74576	74698	74573	74573	he	74	" that 's his last talk , I guess , with them he loves so dear . I 've got my piece o ' news , and thanky to him for that ; but it 's over and done . I 'll take him in a line when we go treasure - hunting , for we 'll keep him like so much gold , in case of accidents , you mark , and in the meantime . Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions , why then we 'll talk Mr. Hawkins over , we will , and we 'll give him his share , to be sure , for all his kindness . "

75944	75953	75934	75935	old Morgan	104	" for that 's clean a - top . "
76026	76032	76034	76035	George Merry	156	" He was a seaman , "
76056	76066	76034	76035	George Merry	156	" Leastways , this is good sea - cloth . "
76067	76072	76074	76074	Silver	95	" Aye , aye , "
76076	76112	76074	76074	Silver	95	" like enough ; you would n't look to find a bishop here , I reckon . But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie ? ' Tain't in natur ' . "
76194	76205	76207	76207	Silver	95	" I 've taken a notion into my old numbskull , "
76209	76249	76207	76207	Silver	95	" Here 's the compass ; there 's the tip - top p'int o ' Skeleton Island , stickin ' out like a tooth . Just take a bearing , will you , along the line of them bones . "
76274	76279	76281	76282	the cook	916	" I thought so , "
76284	76392	76281	76282	the cook	916	" this here is a p'inter . Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars . But , by thunder ! If it do n't make me cold inside to think of Flint . This is one of HIS jokes , and no mistake . Him and these six was alone here ; he killed 'em , every man ; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass , shiver my timbers ! They 're long bones , and the hair 's been yellow . Aye , that would be Allardyce . You mind Allardyce , Tom Morgan ? "
76393	76398	76400	76400	Morgan	104	" Aye , aye , "
76402	76423	76431	76431	another	602	" I mind him ; he owed me money , he did , and took my knife ashore with him . "
76424	76429	76431	76431	another	602	" Speaking of knives , "
76433	76466	76431	76431	another	602	" why do n't we find his'n lying round ? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman 's pocket ; and the birds , I guess , would leave it be . "
76467	76477	76479	76479	Silver	95	" By the powers , and that 's true ! "
76481	76490	76492	76492	Merry	156	" There ai n't a thing left here , "
76501	76519	76492	76492	Merry	156	" not a copper doit nor a baccy box . It do n't look nat'ral to me . "
76520	76530	76532	76532	Silver	95	" No , by gum , it do n't , "
76534	76584	76532	76532	Silver	95	" not nat'ral , nor not nice , says you . Great guns ! Messmates , but if Flint was living , this would be a hot spot for you and me . Six they were , and six are we ; and bones is what they are now . "
76585	76595	76597	76597	Morgan	104	" I saw him dead with these here deadlights , "
76599	76617	76597	76597	Morgan	104	" Billy took me in . There he laid , with penny - pieces on his eyes . "
76618	76631	76633	76637	the fellow with the bandage	2578	" Dead aye , sure enough he 's dead and gone below , "
76639	76663	76633	76637	the fellow with the bandage	2578	" but if ever sperrit walked , it would be Flint 's . Dear heart , but he died bad , did Flint ! "
76664	76671	76673	76673	another	602	" Aye , that he did , "
76675	76753	76673	76673	another	602	" now he raged , and now he hollered for the rum , and now he sang . ' Fifteen Men ' were his only song , mates ; and I tell you true , I never rightly liked to hear it since . It was main hot , and the windy was open , and I hear that old song comin ' out as clear as clear and the death - haul on the man already . "
76754	76759	76761	76761	Silver	95	" Come , come , "
76809	76861	76798	76798	Care	166	" We started , certainly ; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight , the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood , but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath . The terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits .
77066	77074	77076	77076	he	95	" There are three ' tall trees ' "
77078	77125	77076	77076	he	95	" about in the right line from Skeleton Island . ' Spy - glass shoulder , ' I take it , means that lower p'int there . It 's child 's play to find the stuff now . I 've half a mind to dine first . "
77126	77133	77135	77135	Morgan	104	" I do n't feel sharp , "
77137	77151	77135	77135	Morgan	104	" Thinkin ' o ' Flint I think it were as done me . "
77152	77168	77170	77170	Silver	95	" Ah , well , my son , you praise your stars he 's dead , "
77172	77179	77181	77183	a third pirate	2597	" He were an ugly devil , "
77188	77196	77181	77183	a third pirate	2597	" that blue in the face too ! "
77197	77206	77208	77208	Merry	156	" That was how the rum took him , "
77210	77227	77208	77208	Merry	156	" Blue ! Well , I reckon he was blue . That 's a true word . "
77309	77330	77331	77331	I	0	" Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest Yo - ho - ho , and a bottle of rum ! "
77371	77378	77380	77380	Merry	156	" It 's Flint , by ! "
77452	77455	77457	77457	Silver	95	" Come , "
77470	77515	77457	77457	Silver	95	" this wo n't do . Stand by to go about . This is a rum start , and I ca n't name the voice , but it 's someone skylarking someone that 's flesh and blood , and you may lay to that . "
77588	77592	77644	77645	The buccaneers	595	" Darby M'Graw , "
77605	77612	77644	77645	The buccaneers	595	" Darby M'Graw ! Darby M'Graw ! "
77635	77643	77631	77631	I	0	" Fetch aft the rum , Darby ! "
77677	77682	77684	77684	one	596	" That fixes it ! "
77686	77691	77684	77684	one	596	" Let 's go . "
77692	77699	77701	77701	Morgan	104	" They was his last words , "
77703	77710	77701	77701	Morgan	104	" his last words above board . "
77764	77775	77776	77776	he	121	" Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby , "
77779	77788	77776	77776	he	121	" not one but us that 's here . "
77797	77800	77801	77801	he	121	" Shipmates , "
77804	77890	77801	77801	he	121	" I 'm here to get that stuff , and I 'll not be beat by man or devil . I never was feared of Flint in his life , and , by the powers , I 'll face him dead . There 's seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here . When did ever a gentleman o ' fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug and him dead too ? "
77917	77923	77925	77925	Merry	156	" Belay there , John ! "
77927	77935	77925	77925	Merry	156	" Do n't you cross a sperrit . "
77990	77997	77998	77998	he	95	" Sperrit ? Well , maybe , "
78001	78057	77998	77998	he	95	" But there 's one thing not clear to me . There was an echo . Now , no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow ; well then , what 's he doing with an echo to him , I should like to know ? That ai n't in natur ' , surely ? "
78088	78095	78096	78096	he	95	" Well , that 's so , "
78099	78175	78096	78096	he	95	" You 've a head upon your shoulders , John , and no mistake . ' Bout ship , mates ! This here crew is on a wrong tack , I do believe . And come to think on it , it was like Flint 's voice , I grant you , but not just so clear - away like it , after all . It was liker somebody else 's voice now it was liker "
78176	78184	78186	78186	Silver	95	" By the powers , Ben Gunn ! "
78188	78196	78198	78198	Morgan	104	" Aye , and so it were , "
78205	78211	78198	78198	Morgan	104	" Ben Gunn it were ! "
78212	78225	78227	78227	Dick	121	" It do n't make much odds , do it , now ? "
78229	78242	78227	78227	Dick	121	" Ben Gunn 's not here in the body any more'n Flint . "
78253	78261	78263	78263	Merry	156	" Why , nobody minds Ben Gunn , "
78265	78274	78263	78263	Merry	156	" dead or alive , nobody minds him . "
78391	78396	78398	78398	he	95	" I told you , "
78399	78433	78435	78435	he	95	" I told you you had sp'iled your Bible . If it ai n't no good to swear by , what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it ? Not that ! "
79134	79142	79144	79144	Merry	156	" Huzza , mates , all together ! "
79393	79396	79397	79397	he	95	" Jim , "
79400	79410	79397	79397	he	95	" take that , and stand by for trouble . "
79463	79470	79450	79450	he	95	" Here is a narrow corner , "
79503	79511	79497	79497	I	0	" So you 've changed sides again . "
79600	79604	79606	79606	Merry	156	" Two guineas ! "
79613	79650	79606	79606	Merry	156	" That 's your seven hundred thousand pounds , is it ? You 're the man for bargains , ai n't you ? You 're him that never bungled nothing , you wooden - headed lubber ! "
79651	79657	79659	79659	Silver	95	" Dig away , boys , "
79665	79679	79659	79659	Silver	95	" you 'll find some pig - nuts and I should n't wonder . "
79680	79685	79687	79687	Merry	156	" Pig - nuts ! "
79693	79728	79606	79606	Merry	156	" Mates , do you hear that ? I tell you now , that man there knew it all along . Look in the face of him and you 'll see it wrote there . "
79729	79734	79736	79736	Silver	95	" Ah , Merry , "
79754	79880	79881	79881	Mates	2978	" But this time everyone was entirely in Merry 's favour . They began to scramble out of the excavation , darting furious glances behind them . One thing I observed , which looked well for us : they all got out upon the opposite side from Silver . Well , there we stood , two on one side , five on the other , the pit between us , and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow . Silver never moved ; he watched them , very upright on his crutch , and looked as cool as ever I saw him . He was brave , and no mistake . At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters . "
79883	79887	79881	79881	Mates	2978	" says he , "
79930	80051	80052	80052	George	156	" He was raising his arm and his voice , and plainly meant to lead a charge . But just then crack ! crack ! crack ! three musket - shots flashed out of the thicket . Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation ; the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side , where he lay dead , but still twitching ; and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might . Before you could wink , Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling Merry , and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony , "
80054	80058	80052	80052	George	156	" said he , "
80065	80093	80061	80061	I	0	" At the same moment , the doctor , Gray , and Ben Gunn joined us , with smoking muskets , from among the nutmeg - trees . "
80096	80101	80061	80061	I	0	" cried the doctor . "
80116	80211	80212	80212	Doctor	2886	" And we set off at a great pace , sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest . I tell you , but Silver was anxious to keep up with us . The work that man went through , leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst , was work no sound man ever equalled ; and so thinks the doctor . As it was , he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope . "
80214	80225	80212	80212	Doctor	2886	" he hailed , ' see there ! No hurry ! "
80296	80303	80305	80305	he	95	" Thank ye kindly , doctor , "
80307	80333	80334	80334	he	95	" You came in in about the nick , I guess , for me and Hawkins . And so it 's you , Ben Gunn ! "
80337	80350	80334	80334	he	95	" Well , you 're a nice one , to be sure . "
80351	80360	80362	80363	the maroon	2666	" I 'm Ben Gunn , I am , "
80373	80376	80377	80377	he	95	" And , "
80385	80402	80377	80377	he	95	" how do , Mr. Silver ? Pretty well , I thank ye , says you . "
80403	80408	80410	80410	Silver	101	" Ben , Ben , "
80412	80421	80410	80410	Silver	101	" to think as you 've done me ! "
80702	80709	80710	80710	he	103	" As for you , Jim , "
80713	80750	80710	80710	he	103	" it went against my heart , but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty ; and if you were not one of these , whose fault was it ? "
80892	80895	80897	80897	Silver	101	" Ah , "
80899	80931	80897	80897	Silver	101	" it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here . You would have let old John be cut to bits , and never given it a thought , doctor . "
80932	80937	80939	80940	Dr. Livesey	63	" Not a thought , "
81320	81324	81325	81325	he	661	" John Silver , "
81328	81376	81325	81325	he	661	" you 're a prodigious villain and imposter a monstrous imposter , sir . I am told I am not to prosecute you . Well , then , I will not . But the dead men , sir , hang about your neck like mill - stones . "
81377	81384	81386	81387	Long John	95	" Thank you kindly , sir , "
81392	81400	81402	81403	the squire	661	" I dare you to thank me ! "
81405	81418	81402	81403	the squire	661	" It is a gross dereliction of my duty . Stand back . "
81606	81612	81614	81615	the captain	234	" Come in , Jim , "
81617	81667	81614	81615	the captain	234	" You 're a good boy in your line , Jim , but I do n't think you and me'll go to sea again . You 're too much of the born favourite for me . Is that you , John Silver ? What brings you here , man ? "
81668	81677	81679	81679	Silver	95	" Come back to my dooty , sir , "
81681	81684	81686	81687	the captain	234	" Ah ! "
82259	82264	82266	82267	the doctor	289	" Heaven forgive them , "
82269	82275	82266	82267	the doctor	289	" ' tis the mutineers ! "
82276	82282	82288	82288	Silver	95	" All drunk , sir , "
82439	82444	82446	82446	he	95	" Drunk or raving , "
82448	82455	82457	82457	Silver	95	" Right you were , sir , "
82459	82471	82457	82457	Silver	95	" and precious little odds which , to you and me . "
82472	82487	82489	82490	the doctor	289	" I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man , "
82495	82554	82489	82490	the doctor	289	" and so my feelings may surprise you , Master Silver . But if I were sure they were raving as I am morally certain one , at least , of them is down with fever I should leave this camp , and at whatever risk to my own carcass , take them the assistance of my skill . "
82555	82568	82457	82457	Silver	95	" Ask your pardon , sir , you would be very wrong , "
82572	82656	82570	82570	Silver	101	" You would lose your precious life , and you may lay to that . I 'm on your side now , hand and glove ; and I should n't wish for to see the party weakened , let alone yourself , seeing as I know what I owes you . But these men down there , they could n't keep their word no , not supposing they wished to ; and what 's more , they could n't believe as you could . "
82657	82660	82662	82663	the doctor	289	" No , "
82665	82679	82662	82663	the doctor	289	" You 're the man to keep your word , we know that . "
83505	83516	83484	83484	he	2666	" that man with the one leg had stayed aboard . "
83635	83646	83623	83630	Five men only of those who had sailed	2813	" Drink and the devil had done for the rest , "
84010	84019	84002	84003	Captain Flint	74	" Pieces of eight ! Pieces of eight ! "
