1144	1210	1212	1212	she	88	" Young ladies ! there will be an interval allowed of half an hour . Ring the bell , Miss Sutton . Martha shall bring you up some bread and cheese and beer . You will be so good as to eat it standing away from the dresses and to have your hands washed ready for work when I return . In half an hour , "
1853	1858	1866	1866	herself	384	" Ruth , love , "
1875	1895	1866	1866	herself	384	" come and have some supper . You do n't know yet how it helps one through the night . "
1896	1911	1913	1913	Ruth	87	" One run one blow of the fresh air would do me more good , "
1915	1923	1925	1926	the other	385	" Not such a night as this , "
1934	1946	1948	1948	Ruth	87	" And why not such a night as this , Jenny ? "
1950	2013	2014	2014	she	87	" Oh ! at home I have many a time run up the lane all the way to the mill , just to see the icicles hang on the great wheel ; and when I was once out , I could hardly find in my heart to come in , even to mother , sitting by the fire ; even to mother , "
2033	2038	2040	2040	she	87	" Why , Jenny ! "
2055	2126	2040	2040	she	87	" own , now , that you never saw those dismal , hateful , tumble - down old houses there look half so what shall I call them ? almost beautiful as they do now , with that soft , pure , exquisite covering ; and if they are so improved , think of what trees , and grass , and ivy must be on such a night as this . "
2661	2664	2654	2654	she	88	" without fail "
2733	2811	2812	2812	She	88	" I may as well inform you , young ladies , that I have been requested this year , as on previous occasions , to allow some of my young people to attend in the ante - chamber of the assembly - room with sandal ribbon , pins , and such little matters , and to be ready to repair any accidental injury to the ladies ' dresses . I shall send four of the most diligent . "
2920	2923	2900	2900	she	88	" establishment ; "
3037	3080	3083	3083	Ruth	87	" Oh ! how shall I get through five years of these terrible nights ! in that close room ! and in that oppressive stillness ! which lets every sound of the thread be heard as it goes eternally backwards and forwards , "
3098	3175	3177	3177	Jenny	91	" Nay , Ruth , you know it wo n't be always as it has been to - night . We often get to bed by ten o'clock ; and by - and - by you wo n't mind the closeness of the room . You 're worn out to - night , or you would not have minded the sound of the needle ; I never hear it . Come , let me unfasten you , "
3179	3199	3246	3246	she	87	" What is the use of undressing ? We must be up again and at work in three hours . "
3200	3231	3246	3246	she	87	" And in those three hours you may get a great deal of rest , if you will but undress yourself and fairly go to bed . Come , love . "
3249	3271	3246	3246	she	87	" Oh ! I wish I was not so cross and impatient . I do n't think I used to be . "
3272	3312	3314	3314	Jenny	91	" No , I am sure not . Most new girls get impatient at first ; but it goes off , and they do n't care much for anything after awhile . Poor child ! she 's asleep already , "
3443	3448	3439	3439	Jenny	91	" Ruth ! Ruth ! "
3449	3454	3456	3456	Ruth	87	" Oh , Jenny ! "
3476	3532	3456	3456	Ruth	87	" I thought I saw mamma by the side of the bed , coming , as she used to do , to see if I were asleep and comfortable ; and when I tried to take hold of her , she went away and left me alone I do n't know where ; so strange ! "
3533	3578	3456	3456	Ruth	87	" It was only a dream ; you know you 'd been talking about her to me , and you 're feverish with sitting up late . Go to sleep again , and I 'll watch , and waken you if you seem uneasy . "
3579	3593	3594	3594	Ruth	87	" But you 'll be so tired . Oh , dear ! dear ! "
3620	3653	3594	3594	Ruth	87	" Miss Sutton , Miss Jennings , Miss Booth , and Miss Hilton , you will see that you are ready to accompany me to the shire - hall by eight o'clock . "
3900	3954	3955	3955	She	87	" If you please , Mrs Mason , I was not one of the most diligent ; I am afraid I believe I was not diligent at all . I was very tired ; and I could not help thinking , and when I think , I ca n't attend to my work . "
3982	4038	3967	3968	Mrs Mason	88	" Well , my dear , you must learn to think and work too ; or , if you ca n't do both , you must leave off thinking . Your guardian , you know , expects you to make great progress in your business , and I am sure you wo n't disappoint him . "
4067	4070	4080	4080	she	88	" new girl "
4091	4121	4057	4057	her	88	" But as I was not diligent I ought not to go , ma'am . Miss Wood was far more industrious than I , and many of the others . "
4122	4126	4128	4129	Mrs Mason	88	" Tiresome girl ! "
4131	4147	4128	4129	Mrs Mason	88	" I 've half a mind to keep her at home for plaguing me so . "
4213	4217	4219	4220	Mrs Mason	88	" Miss Hilton , "
4226	4279	4281	4281	she	88	" I am not accustomed as these young ladies can tell you to have my decisions questioned . What I say , I mean ; and I have my reasons . So sit down , if you please , and take care and be ready by eight . Not a word more , "
4291	4303	4305	4305	Ruth	87	" Jenny ! you ought to have gone , not me , "
4322	4387	4281	4281	she	88	" Hush ! Ruth . I could not go if I might , because of my cough . I would rather give it up to you than any one , if it were mine to give . And suppose it is , and take the pleasure as my present , and tell me every bit about it when you come home to - night . "
4388	4482	4498	4499	Mrs Mason	88	" Well ! I shall take it in that way , and not as if I 'd earned it , which I have n't . So thank you . You ca n't think how I shall enjoy it now . I did work diligently for five minutes last night , after I heard of it , I wanted to go so much . But I could not keep it up . Oh , dear ! and I shall really hear a band ! and see the inside of that beautiful shire - hall ! "
4501	4505	4281	4281	she	88	" her young ladies "
4579	4589	4591	4592	Mrs Mason	88	" Is that your best frock , Miss Hilton ? "
4621	4626	4628	4628	Ruth	87	" Yes , ma'am , "
4632	4641	4591	4592	Mrs Mason	88	" Oh ! indeed . Then it will do "
4649	4701	4591	4592	Mrs Mason	88	" Dress , young ladies , you know , is a very secondary consideration . Conduct is everything . Still , Miss Hilton , I think you should write and ask your guardian to send you money for another gown . I am sorry I did not think of it before . "
4702	4715	4717	4717	Ruth	87	" I do not think he would send any if I wrote , "
4724	4741	4717	4717	Ruth	87	" He was angry when I wanted a shawl , when the cold weather set in . "
4765	4779	4781	4799	a merry , good - natured girl , whose plainness excluded her from any of the envy of rivalry	439	" Never mind , Ruthie ; you 're prettier than any of them , "
4801	4810	4812	4812	Ruth	87	" Yes ! I know I am pretty , "
4816	4884	4812	4812	Ruth	87	" but I am sorry I have no better gown , for this is very shabby . I am ashamed of it myself , and I can see Mrs Mason is twice as much ashamed . I wish I need not go . I did not know we should have to think about our own dress at all , or I should not have wished to go . "
4885	4891	4893	4893	Jenny	91	" Never mind , Ruth , "
4895	4919	4893	4893	Jenny	91	" you 've been looked at now , and Mrs Mason will soon be too busy to think about you and your gown . "
4920	4933	4935	4936	one girl	440	" Did you hear Ruth Hilton say she knew she was pretty ? "
4948	4955	4957	4957	she	87	" I could not help knowing , "
4961	4970	4957	4957	she	87	" for many people have told me so . "
5444	5447	5458	5459	Mrs Mason	88	" On condition "
5865	5871	5873	5874	the gentleman	479	" Shall I leave you ? "
5876	5882	5873	5874	the gentleman	479	" Is my absence necessary ? "
5883	5888	5890	5891	the lady	480	" Oh , no ! "
5893	5914	5890	5891	the lady	480	" A few stitches will set all to rights . Besides , I dare not enter that room by myself . "
5929	5940	5925	5925	she	480	" Make haste . Do n't keep me an hour . "
5994	6035	6046	6046	she	87	" Oh , that lovely galop ! How I long to dance to it ! Will it never be done ? What a frightful time you are taking ; and I 'm dying to return in time for this galop ! "
6222	6275	6308	6308	He	101	" Oh , Mr Bellingham ! I 'm ashamed to detain you so long . I had no idea any one could have spent so much time over a little tear . No wonder Mrs Mason charges so much for dress - making , if her work - women are so slow . "
6353	6365	6367	6367	she	87	" I am sorry I have been so long , ma'am , "
6377	6394	6395	6395	She	87	" I was afraid it might tear out again if I did not do it carefully . "
6398	6413	6415	6417	the young lady	486	" I would rather have had it torn than have missed that charming galop , "
6430	6438	6415	6417	the young lady	486	" Shall we go , Mr Bellingham ? "
6474	6499	6460	6460	He	101	" Allow me , Miss Duncombe , to give this in your name to this young lady , as thanks for her dexterous help . "
6500	6505	6507	6507	she	486	" Oh of course , "
6543	6557	6559	6559	they	430	" What was the matter with Miss Duncombe ? Did she come here ? "
6561	6574	6576	6576	Ruth	87	" Only her lace dress was torn , and I mended it , "
6580	6605	6641	6641	he	101	" Did Mr Bellingham come with her ? They say he 's going to be married to her ; did he come , Ruth ? "
6606	6609	6611	6611	Ruth	87	" Yes , "
7087	7118	7060	7060	She	87	" Was it not kind of him ? You ca n't think how nicely he did it , just when I was a little bit mortified by her ungracious ways . "
7119	7127	7129	7129	Jenny	91	" It was very nice , indeed , "
7131	7144	7129	7129	Jenny	91	" Such a beautiful flower ! I wish it had some scent . "
7145	7163	7165	7165	Ruth	87	" I wish it to be exactly as it is ; it is perfect . So pure ! "
7178	7184	7165	7165	Ruth	87	" Who is Mr Bellingham ? "
7185	7206	7208	7208	Jenny	91	" He is son to that Mrs Bellingham of the Priory , for whom we made the grey satin pelisse , "
7212	7219	7221	7221	Ruth	87	" That was before my time , "
7286	7294	7296	7296	Jenny	91	" She is dreaming of last night , "
7661	7691	7756	7757	Mrs Mason	88	" Miss Hilton ! where have you put the blue Persian ? Whenever things are mislaid , I know it has been Miss Hilton 's evening for siding away ! "
7692	7719	7721	7724	one of the girls	519	" Miss Hilton was going out last night , so I offered to clear the workroom for her . I will find it directly , ma'am , "
7726	7754	7756	7757	Mrs Mason	88	" Oh , I am well aware of Miss Hilton 's custom of shuffling off her duties upon any one who can be induced to relieve her , "
7811	7843	7845	7846	Mrs Mason	88	" Where is the skirt of Lady Farnham 's dress ? The flounces not put on ! I am surprised . May I ask to whom this work was entrusted yesterday ? "
7854	7879	7849	7849	her	88	" I was to have done it , but I made a mistake , and had to undo it . I am very sorry . "
7880	7915	7849	7849	her	88	" I might have guessed , certainly . There is little difficulty , to be sure , in discovering , when work has been neglected or spoilt , into whose hands it has fallen . "
8017	8025	7980	7980	she	87	" Do n't cry , Miss Hilton , "
8026	8035	7980	7980	she	87	" Ruthie , never mind the old dragon , "
8036	8063	7980	7980	she	87	" How will you bear on for five years , if you do n't spirit yourself up not to care a straw for what she says ? "
8094	8145	8079	8079	Jenny	91	" Suppose Ruth goes out instead of you , Fanny Barton , to do the errands . The fresh air will do her good ; and you know you dislike the cold east winds , while Ruth says she enjoys frost and snow , and all kinds of shivery weather . "
8518	8545	8498	8500	one little man	548	" I 'll set thee a craddy , Tom ! Thou dar'n't go over yon black line in the water , out into the real river . "
8640	8652	8612	8612	they	545	" Well done , Tom ; thou hast done it rarely ! "
8943	8948	8950	8950	she	87	" Is he dead ? "
8991	8996	8998	8999	Mr Bellingham	101	" I think not , "
9015	9028	9002	9002	he	566	" Is he your brother ? Do you know who he is ? "
9029	9032	9034	9034	Ruth	87	" Look ! "
9052	9072	9034	9034	Ruth	87	" his hand twitches ! he lives ! oh , sir , he lives ! Whose boy is he ? "
9092	9100	9102	9102	they	469	" He 's old Nelly Brownson 's , "
9104	9108	9102	9102	they	469	" Her grandson . "
9109	9119	9121	9121	she	87	" We must take him into a house directly , "
9123	9130	9121	9121	she	87	" Is his home far off ? "
9131	9142	9102	9102	they	469	" No , no ; it 's just close by . "
9143	9154	9156	9157	Mr Bellingham	101	" One of you go for a doctor at once , "
9161	9181	9182	9182	he	101	" and bring him to the old woman 's without delay . You must not hold him any longer , "
9199	9219	9182	9182	he	101	" your dress is dripping wet already . Here ! you fellow , take him up , d'ye see ! "
9274	9278	9280	9280	she	579	" Dear heart ! "
9282	9298	9280	9280	she	579	" he 's the last of 'em all , and he 's gone afore me . "
9299	9302	9304	9305	Mr Bellingham	101	" Nonsense , "
9307	9318	9304	9305	Mr Bellingham	101	" the boy is alive , and likely to live . "
9384	9397	9399	9400	Mr Bellingham	101	" What a confounded time these people are in fetching the doctor , "
9464	9601	9603	9603	he	589	" It takes so much to knock an idea into such stupid people 's heads . They stood gaping and asking which doctor they were to go for , as if it signified whether it was Brown or Smith , so long as he had his wits about him . I have no more time to waste here , either ; I was on the gallop when I caught sight of the lad ; and , now he has fairly sobbed and opened his eyes , I see no use in my staying in this stifling atmosphere . May I trouble you with one thing ? Will you be so good as to see that the little fellow has all that he wants ? If you 'll allow me , I 'll leave you my purse , "
9657	9714	9637	9637	she	87	" I shall not want so much , really , sir . One sovereign will be plenty more than enough . May I take that out , and I will give you back what is left of it when I see you again ? or , perhaps I had better send it to you , sir ? "
9715	9796	9797	9797	They	590	" I think you had better keep it all at present . Oh ! what a horrid dirty place this is ; insufferable two minutes longer . You must not stay here ; you 'll be poisoned with this abominable air . Come towards the door , I beg . Well , if you think one sovereign will be enough , I will take my purse ; only , remember you apply to me if you think they want more . "
9985	9988	9990	9990	he	592	" No ! "
9992	10068	9990	9990	he	592	" I see it would be better that you should keep the purse . Many things may be wanted for the lad which we can not calculate upon now . If I remember rightly , there are three sovereigns and some loose change ; I shall , perhaps , see you again in a few days , when , if there be any money left in the purse , you can restore it to me . "
10069	10076	10078	10078	Ruth	87	" Oh , yes , sir , "
10111	10125	10127	10127	he	592	" Is there any chance of my meeting you again in this house ? "
10129	10160	9990	9990	he	592	" I hope to come whenever I can , sir ; but I must run in errand - times , and I do n't know when my turn may be . "
10161	10163	9990	9990	he	592	" Oh "
10171	10202	9990	9990	he	592	" I should like to know how you think the boy is going on , if it is not giving you too much trouble ; do you ever take walks ? "
10203	10212	9990	9990	he	592	" Not for walking 's sake , sir . "
10213	10216	10218	10218	he	592	" Well ! "
10220	10243	10218	10218	he	592	" you go to church , I suppose ? Mrs Mason does not keep you at work on Sundays , I trust ? "
10244	10257	9990	9990	he	592	" Oh , no , sir . I go to church regularly . "
10258	10288	10218	10218	he	592	" Then , perhaps , you will be so good as to tell me what church you go to , and I will meet you there next Sunday afternoon ? "
10289	10330	9990	9990	he	592	" I go to St Nicholas ' , sir . I will take care and bring you word how the boy is , and what doctor they get ; and I will keep an account of the money I spend . "
10331	10345	10346	10346	He	594	" Very well ; thank you . Remember , I trust to you . "
10412	10434	10391	10391	he	594	" It seems rather strange , but we have no one to introduce us ; my name is Bellingham yours is ? "
10435	10441	10442	10442	she	87	" Ruth Hilton , sir , "
10529	10534	10536	10536	he	594	" My good woman , "
10541	10582	10536	10536	he	594	" could you not keep your place a little neater and cleaner ? It is more fit for pigs than human beings . The air in this room is quite offensive , and the dirt and filth is really disgraceful . "
10609	10645	10601	10603	the old woman	4405	" Who may you be , that knows no better manners than to come into a poor woman 's house to abuse it ? fit for pigs , indeed ! What d'ye call yon fellow ? "
10646	10652	10654	10654	Ruth	87	" He is Mr Bellingham , "
10665	10708	10654	10654	Ruth	87	" It was he that rode into the water to save your grandson . He would have been drowned but for Mr Bellingham . I thought once they would both have been swept away by the current , it was so strong . "
10709	10719	10720	10722	the old woman	4405	" The river is none so deep , either , "
10744	10807	10720	10722	the old woman	4405	" Some one else would have saved him , if this fine young spark had never been near . He 's an orphan , and God watches over orphans , they say . I 'd rather it had been any one else as had picked him out , than one who comes into a poor body 's house only to abuse it . "
10808	10819	10821	10821	Ruth	87	" He did not come in only to abuse it , "
10825	10846	10821	10821	Ruth	87	" He came with little Tom ; he only said it was not quite so clean as it might be . "
10847	10926	10943	10945	the old woman	4405	" What ! you 're taking up the cry , are you ? Wait till you are an old woman like me , crippled with rheumatiz , and a lad to see after like Tom , who is always in mud when he is n't in water ; and his food and mine to scrape together God knows we 're often short , and do the best I can , and water to fetch up that steep brow . "
11916	11923	11925	11925	he	101	" Miss Hilton , I believe , "
11947	11968	11925	11925	he	101	" How is our little sailor going on ? Well , I trust , from the symptoms the other day . "
11969	12065	11925	11925	he	101	" I believe , sir , he is quite well now . I am very sorry , but I have not been able to go and see him . I am so sorry I could not help it . But I have got one or two things through another person . I have put them down on this slip of paper ; and here is your purse , sir , for I am afraid I can do nothing more for him . We have illness in the house , and it makes us very busy . "
12158	12171	12149	12149	She	87	" I am very sorry I have done so little , sir . "
12172	12198	12149	12149	She	87	" Oh , yes , I am sure you have done all you could . It was thoughtless in me to add to your engagements . "
12199	12206	12208	12208	Ruth	87	" He is displeased with me , "
12210	12265	12208	12208	Ruth	87	" for what he believes to have been neglect of the boy , whose life he risked his own to save . If I told all , he would see that I could not do more ; but I can not tell him all the sorrows and worries that have taken up my time . "
12266	12301	12303	12303	he	649	" And yet I am tempted to give you another little commission , if it is not taking up too much of your time , and presuming too much on your good - nature , "
12313	12411	12303	12303	he	649	" Mrs Mason lives in Heneage Place , does not she ? My mother 's ancestors lived there ; and once , when the house was being repaired , she took me in to show me the old place . There was an old hunting - piece painted on a panel over one of the chimney - pieces ; the figures were portraits of my ancestors . I have often thought I should like to purchase it , if it still remained there . Can you ascertain this for me , and bring me word next Sunday ? "
12412	12419	12421	12421	Ruth	87	" Oh , yes , sir , "
12446	12466	12303	12303	he	649	" I 'll look directly I get home , and ask Mrs Mason to write and let you know . "
12467	12471	12473	12473	he	650	" Thank you , "
12479	12551	12473	12473	he	650	" I think perhaps , however , it might be as well not to trouble Mrs Mason about it ; you see , it would compromise me , and I am not quite determined to purchase the picture ; if you would ascertain whether the painting is there , and tell me , I would take a little time to reflect , and afterwards I could apply to Mrs Mason myself . "
12552	12564	12574	12575	Mrs Wood	113	" Very well , sir ; I will see about it . "
14193	14196	14203	14203	she	88	" young people "
16363	16368	16327	16327	she	87	" February fill - dyke "
16530	16536	16537	16537	she	87	" How strange it is , "
16542	16706	16537	16537	she	87	" that I should feel as if this charming afternoon 's walk were , somehow , not exactly wrong , but yet as if it were not right . Why can it be ? I am not defrauding Mrs Mason of any of her time ; that I know would be wrong ; I am left to go where I like on Sundays . I have been to church , so it ca n't be because I have missed doing my duty . If I had gone this walk with Jenny , I wonder whether I should have felt as I do now . There must be something wrong in me , myself , to feel so guilty when I have done nothing which is not right ; and yet I can thank God for the happiness I have had in this charming spring walk , which dear mamma used to say was a sign when pleasures were innocent and good for us . "
16776	16803	16804	16804	he	101	" Tell me everything , Ruth , as you would to a brother ; let me help you , if I can , in your difficulties , "
16959	17085	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Indeed , sir , I have been very wrong ; if you please , sir , do n't be so angry . She is often very good to us ; it is only sometimes she goes into a passion ; and we are very provoking , I dare say . I know I am for one . I have often to undo my work , and you ca n't think how it spoils anything particularly silk to be unpicked ; and Mrs Mason has to bear all the blame . Oh ! I am sorry I said anything about it . Do n't speak to your mother about it , pray , sir . Mrs Mason thinks so much of Mrs Bellingham 's custom . "
17086	17094	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Well , I wo n't this time "
17128	17144	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" but if ever she does so again , I 'll not answer for myself . "
17145	17157	17159	17159	Ruth	87	" I will take care and not tell again , sir , "
17166	17271	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Nay , Ruth , you are not going to have secrets from me , are you ? Do n't you remember your promise to consider me as a brother ? Go on telling me everything that happens to you , pray ; you can not think how much interest I take in all your interests . I can quite fancy that charming home at Milham you told me about last Sunday . I can almost fancy Mrs Mason 's workroom ; and that , surely , is a proof either of the strength of my imagination , or of your powers of description . "
17275	17310	17272	17272	Ruth	87	" It is , indeed , sir . Our workroom must be so different to anything you ever saw . I think you must have passed through Milham often on your way to Lowford . "
17311	17349	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Then you do n't think it is any stretch of fancy to have so clear an idea as I have of Milham Grange ? On the left hand of the road , is it , Ruth ? "
17350	17392	17272	17272	Ruth	87	" Yes , sir , just over the bridge , and up the hill where the elm - trees meet overhead and make a green shade ; and then comes the dear old Grange , that I shall never see again . "
17393	17422	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Never ! Nonsense , Ruthie ; it is only six miles off ; you may see it any day . It is not an hour 's ride . "
17423	17476	17272	17272	Ruth	87	" Perhaps I may see it again when I am grown old ; I did not think exactly what ' never ' meant ; it is so very long since I was there , and I do n't see any chance of my going for years and years , at any rate . "
17477	17494	16938	16939	Mrs Mason	88	" Why , Ruth , you we may go next Sunday afternoon , if you like . "
17513	17563	17495	17495	She	836	" How , sir ? Can I walk it between afternoon service and the time Mrs Mason comes home ? I would go for only one glimpse ; but if I could get into the house oh , sir ! if I could just see mamma 's room again ! "
17627	17708	17966	17966	his	841	" Are you a good walker , Ruth ? Do you think you can manage six miles ? If we set off at two o'clock , we shall be there by four , without hurrying ; or say half - past four . Then we might stay two hours , and you could show me all the old walks and old places you love , and we could still come leisurely home . Oh , it 's all arranged directly ! "
17709	17742	17966	17966	his	841	" But do you think it would be right , sir ? It seems as if it would be such a great pleasure , that it must be in some way wrong . "
17743	17757	17966	17966	his	841	" Why , you little goose , what can be wrong in it ? "
17758	17775	17777	17777	Ruth	87	" In the first place , I miss going to church by setting out at two , "
17783	17811	17966	17966	his	841	" Only for once . Surely you do n't see any harm in missing church for once ? You will go in the morning , you know . "
17812	17828	17966	17966	his	841	" I wonder if Mrs Mason would think it right if she would allow it ? "
17829	17962	17963	17963	He	841	" No , I dare say not . But you do n't mean to be governed by Mrs Mason 's notions of right and wrong . She thought it right to treat that poor girl Palmer in the way you told me about . You would think that wrong , you know , and so would every one of sense and feeling . Come , Ruth , do n't pin your faith on any one , but judge for yourself . The pleasure is perfectly innocent ; it is not a selfish pleasure either , for I shall enjoy it to the full as much as you will . I shall like to see the places where you spent your childhood ; I shall almost love them as much as you do . "
18595	18598	18555	18557	every successive owner	858	" Home . "
19039	19060	19011	19011	He	869	" God bless thee , lass ; God bless thee ! My old eyes are glad to see thee again . "
19171	19177	19179	19181	the old labourer	882	" And who 's yon ? "
19185	19208	19179	19181	the old labourer	882	" Is he your sweetheart ? Your missis 's son , I reckon . He 's a spruce young chap , anyhow . "
19212	19218	19209	19210	Mr Bellingham	101	" blood of all the Howards "
19239	19247	19209	19210	Mr Bellingham	101	" Hush , Thomas ; pray hush ! "
19281	19285	19263	19264	Mrs Mason	88	" too ridiculous , "
19715	19719	19710	19711	her father	417	" master 's corner "
19858	19882	19884	19885	Mr Bellingham	101	" Dearest Ruth , do n't give way so . It can do no good ; it can not bring back the dead , "
19893	19900	19902	19902	Ruth	87	" I know it can not , "
19904	19923	19902	19902	Ruth	87	" and that is why I cry . I cry because nothing will ever bring them back again . "
19954	19977	19933	19933	his	101	" Come away ; I can not have you stay here , full of painful associations as these rooms must be . Come "
20018	20018	20019	20019	He	101	"
20121	20144	20115	20116	Mr Bellingham	101	" Why does that old man follow us about in that way ? It is excessively impertinent of him , I think . "
20145	20281	20115	20116	Mr Bellingham	101	" Oh , do n't call old Thomas impertinent . He is so good and kind , he is like a father to me . I remember sitting on his knee many and many a time when I was a child , whilst he told me stories out of the ' Pilgrim 's Progress . ' He taught me to suck up milk through a straw . Mamma was very fond of him too . He used to sit with us always in the evenings when papa was away at market , for mamma was rather afraid of having no man in the house , and used to beg old Thomas to stay ; and he would take me on his knee , and listen just as attentively as I did while mamma read aloud . "
20282	20299	20312	20313	Mr Bellingham	101	" You do n't mean to say you have sat upon that old fellow 's knee ? "
20300	20311	20115	20116	Mr Bellingham	101	" Oh , yes ! many and many a time . "
20502	20625	20494	20494	his	887	" She 's a pretty creature , with a glint of her mother about her ; and she 's the same kind lass as ever . Not a bit set up with yon fine manty - maker 's shop she 's in . I misdoubt that young fellow though , for all she called him a real gentleman , and checked me when I asked if he was her sweetheart . If his are not sweetheart 's looks , I 've forgotten all my young days . Here ! they 're going , I suppose . Look ! he wants her to go without a word to the old man ; but she is none so changed as that , I reckon . "
20676	20730	20638	20639	Mr Bellingham	101	" Tell Mary I 'll make her such a fine gown , as soon as ever I set up for myself ; it shall be all in the fashion , big gigot sleeves , that she shall not know herself in them ! Mind you tell her that , Thomas , will you ? "
20731	20774	20783	20784	Mr Bellingham	101	" Aye , that I will , lass ; and I reckon she 'll be pleased to hear thou hast not forgotten thy old merry ways . The Lord bless thee the Lord lift up the light of His countenance upon thee . "
20864	20889	20905	20905	they	933	" My dear , remember the devil goeth about as a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour ; remember that , Ruth . "
21017	21088	21012	21012	he	887	" The Lord may help her to guide her steps aright . He may . But I 'm afeard she 's treading in perilous places . I 'll put my missis up to going to the town and getting speech of her , and telling her a bit of her danger . An old motherly woman like our Mary will set about it better nor a stupid fellow like me . "
21105	21111	21102	21102	He	938	" wrestling for her soul ; "
21121	21129	21102	21102	He	938	" God judgeth not as man judgeth . "

21995	22002	22004	22004	Ruth	87	" Can it be so late ? "
22006	22015	22017	22018	Mr Bellingham	101	" I should not have thought it possible , "
22020	22065	22066	22066	He	101	" But , never mind , you will be at home long before nine . Stay , there is a shorter road , I know , through the fields ; just wait a moment , while I go in and ask the exact way . "
22261	22270	22257	22257	She	88	" keeping up the character of her establishment . "
22434	22442	22443	22443	she	87	" Come here directly , Miss Hilton , "
22471	22530	22462	22462	she	87	" Do n't attempt to show your face at my house again after this conduct . I saw you , and your spark , too . I 'll have no slurs on the character of my apprentices . Do n't say a word . I saw enough . I shall write and tell your guardian to - morrow . "
22607	22631	22585	22585	she	87	" My dearest Ruth ! are you ill ? Speak , darling ! My love , my love , do speak to me ! "
22654	22668	22811	22811	She	1004	" Oh ! did you see her did you hear what she said ? "
22669	22708	22790	22791	Mrs Mason	88	" She ! Who , my darling ? Do n't sob so , Ruth ; tell me what it is . Who has been near you ? who has been speaking to you to make you cry so ? "
22709	22715	22811	22811	She	1004	" Oh , Mrs Mason . "
22725	22743	22790	22791	Mrs Mason	88	" You do n't say so ! are you sure ? I was not away five minutes . "
22744	22781	22790	22791	Mrs Mason	88	" Oh , yes , sir , I 'm quite sure . She was so angry ; she said I must never show my face there again . Oh , dear ! what shall I do ? "
22949	22955	22956	22956	he	101	" It is very unfortunate , "
22972	23034	22968	22968	he	101	" It is very unfortunate ; for , you see , I did not like to name it to you before , but , I believe I have business , in fact , which obliges me to go to town to - morrow to London , I mean ; and I do n't know when I shall be able to return . "
23035	23039	23041	23041	Ruth	87	" To London ! "
23043	23054	23041	23041	Ruth	87	" are you going away ? Oh , Mr Bellingham ! "
23140	23198	23121	23121	he	1006	" I can hardly bear the idea of leaving you , my own Ruth . In such distress , too ; for where you can go I do not know at all . From all you have told me of Mrs Mason , I do n't think she is likely to mitigate her severity in your case . "
23230	23291	23226	23226	He	1006	" Ruth , would you go with me to London ? My darling , I can not leave you here without a home ; the thought of leaving you at all is pain enough , but in these circumstances so friendless , so homeless it is impossible . You must come with me , love , and trust to me . "
23391	23413	23386	23386	He	1006	" Will you not come with me ? Do you not love me enough to trust me ? Oh , Ruth , "
23416	23423	23386	23386	He	1006	" can you not trust me ? "
23434	23469	23386	23386	He	1006	" I can not bear this , love . Your sorrow is absolute pain to me ; but it is worse to feel how indifferent you are how little you care about our separation . "
23484	23510	23512	23512	he	1006	" I may have to join my mother in Paris ; I do n't know when I shall see you again . Oh , Ruth ! "
23516	23524	23512	23512	he	1006	" do you love me at all ? "
23553	23652	23525	23525	She	1007	" What was it you said , love ? Was it not that you did love me ? My darling , you do ! I can tell it by the trembling of this little hand ; then you will not suffer me to go away alone and unhappy , most anxious about you ? There is no other course open to you ; my poor girl has no friends to receive her . I will go home directly , and return in an hour with a carriage . You make me too happy by your silence , Ruth . "
23653	23661	23663	23663	Ruth	87	" Oh , what can I do ! "
23665	23683	23663	23663	Ruth	87	" Mr Bellingham , you should help me , and instead of that you only bewilder me . "
23684	23853	23854	23854	He	1008	" How , my dearest Ruth ? Bewilder you ! It seems so clear to me . Look at the case fairly ! Here you are , an orphan , with only one person to love you , poor child ! thrown off , for no fault of yours , by the only creature on whom you have a claim , that creature a tyrannical , inflexible woman ; what is more natural and , being natural , more right than that you should throw yourself upon the care of the one who loves you dearly who would go through fire and water for you who would shelter you from all harm ? Unless , indeed , as I suspect , you do not care for him . If so , Ruth ! if you do not care for me , we had better part I will leave you at once ; it will be better for me to go , if you do not care for me . "
23890	23930	23883	23883	she	87	" Do n't leave me , please , sir . It is very true I have no friend but you . Do n't leave me , please . But , oh ! do tell me what I must do ! "
23931	24153	23883	23883	she	87	" Will you do it if I tell you ? If you will trust me , I will do my very best for you . I will give you my best advice . You see your position . Mrs Mason writes and gives her own exaggerated account to your guardian ; he is bound by no great love to you , from what I have heard you say , and throws you off ; I , who might be able to befriend you through my mother , perhaps I , who could at least comfort you a little could not I , Ruth ? , am away , far away , for an indefinite time ; that is your position at present . Now , what I advise is this . Come with me into this little inn ; I will order tea for you I am sure you require it sadly and I will leave you there , and go home for the carriage . I will return in an hour at the latest . Then we are together , come what may ; that is enough for me ; is it not for you , Ruth ? Say , yes say it ever so low , but give me the delight of hearing it . Ruth , say yes . "
24164	24167	23883	23883	she	87	" Yes ; "
24192	24221	23883	23883	she	87	" How you tremble , my darling ! You are cold , love ! Come into the house , and I 'll order tea directly and be off . "
24304	24313	24314	24315	The landlord	1018	" Tea , directly , for this lady ! "
24318	24382	24383	24383	He	1018	" Dearest Ruth , I must go ; there is not an instant to be lost ; promise me to take some tea , for you are shivering all over , and deadly pale with the fright that abominable woman has given you . I must go ; I shall be back in half an hour and then no more partings , darling . "
24541	24549	24551	24552	the girl	1025	" Does your head ache , miss ? "
24561	24592	24551	24552	the girl	1025	" Let me make you some tea , miss , it will do you good . Many 's the time poor mother 's headaches were cured by good strong tea . "
24678	24682	24684	24684	Ruth	87	" Thank you , "
24686	24717	24684	24684	Ruth	87	" Do n't let me keep you ; perhaps you are busy . You have been very kind , and the tea has done me a great deal of good . "
24840	24992	24826	24826	he	887	" Dear old Thomas ! He and Mary would take me in , I think ; they would love me all the more if I were cast off . And Mr Bellingham would , perhaps , not be so very long away ; and he would know where to find me if I stayed at Milham Grange . Oh , would it not be better to go to them ? I wonder if he would be very sorry ! I could not bear to make him sorry , so kind as he has been to me ; but I do believe it would be better to go to them , and ask their advice , at any rate . He would follow me there ; and I could talk over what I had better do , with the three best friends I have in the world the only friends I have . "
25391	25406	25408	25408	she	87	" Oh , sir ! I want you to take me to Milham Grange , "
25413	25422	25408	25408	she	87	" Old Thomas would give me a home . "
25423	25462	25464	25464	he	1051	" Well , dearest , we 'll talk of all that in the carriage ; I am sure you will listen to reason . Nay , if you will go to Milham you must go in the carriage , "
25671	25681	25660	25665	The tourists who thronged the rooms	1063	" wi ' their dear little bairnies at hame ; "
25947	25992	25930	25930	he	101	" Nay , Jenny , you 're strangely altered , if you can turn out an old friend on such an evening as this . If I remember right , Pen tre Voelas is twenty miles across the bleakest mountain road I ever saw . "
25993	26050	25930	25930	he	101	" Indeed , sir , and I did not know you ; Mr Bellingham , I believe . Indeed , sir , Pen tre Voelas is not above eighteen miles we only charge for eighteen ; it may not be much above seventeen ; and we 're quite full , indeed , more 's the pity . "
26051	26082	25930	25930	he	101	" Well , but Jenny , to oblige me , an old friend , you can find lodgings out for some of your people the house across , for instance . "
26083	26132	25930	25930	he	101	" Indeed , sir , and it 's at liberty ; perhaps you would not mind lodging there yourself ; I could get you the best rooms , and send over a trifle or so of furniture , if they wern't as you 'd wish them to be . "
26133	26209	25930	25930	he	101	" No , Jenny ! here I stay . You 'll not induce me to venture over into those rooms , whose dirt I know of old . Ca n't you persuade some one who is not an old friend to move across ? Say , if you like , that I had written beforehand to bespeak the rooms . Oh ! I know you can manage it I know your good - natured ways . "
26210	26276	25930	25930	he	101	" Indeed , sir well ! I 'll see , if you and the lady will just step into the back parlour , sir there 's no one there just now ; the lady is keeping her bed to - day for a cold , and the gentleman is having a rubber at whist in number three . I 'll see what I can do . "
26277	26303	25930	25930	he	101	" Thank you , thank you . Is there a fire ? if not , one must be lighted . Come , Ruthie , come . "
26388	26399	26401	26401	Ruth	87	" I did not know you had been here before , "
26413	26467	26404	26405	Mr Bellingham	101	" Oh , yes ; three years ago I was here on a reading party . We were here above two months , attracted by Jenny 's kind heart and oddities ; but driven away finally by the insufferable dirt . However , for a week or two it wo n't much signify . "
26468	26489	26401	26401	Ruth	87	" But can she take us in , sir ? I thought I heard her saying her house was full . "
26490	26546	26404	26405	Mr Bellingham	101	" Oh , yes I dare say it is ; but I shall pay her well ; she can easily make excuses to some poor devil , and send him over to the other side ; and , for a day or two , so that we have shelter , it does not much signify . "
26547	26562	26401	26401	Ruth	87	" Could not we go to the house on the other side , sir ? "
26563	26610	26404	26405	Mr Bellingham	101	" And have our meals carried across to us in a half - warm state , to say nothing of having no one to scold for bad cooking ! You do n't know these out - of - the - way Welsh inns yet , Ruthie . "
26611	26621	26623	26623	Ruth	87	" No ! I only thought it seemed rather unfair "
26751	26761	26763	26763	Jenny	91	" Indeed ! and she 's not his wife , "
26765	26843	26763	26763	Jenny	91	" that 's clear as day . His wife would have brought her maid , and given herself twice as many airs about the sitting - rooms ; while this poor miss never spoke , but kept as still as a mouse . Indeed , and young men will be young men ; and , as long as their fathers and mothers shut their eyes , it 's none of my business to go about asking questions . "
27188	27193	27194	27194	he	101	" Really , Ruth , "
27210	27278	27194	27194	he	101	" one would think you had never seen a shower of rain before ; it quite wearies me to see you sitting there watching this detestable weather with such a placid countenance ; and for the last two hours you have said nothing more amusing or interesting than ' Oh , how beautiful ! ' or , ' There 's another cloud coming across Moel Wynn . ' "
27351	27406	27347	27347	he	101	" I remember when we were reading here three years ago , we had a week of just such weather as this ; but Howard and Johnson were capital whist players , and Wilbraham not bad , so we got through the days famously . Can you play ťcartť , Ruth , or picquet ? "
27407	27423	27425	27425	Ruth	87	" No , sir ; I have sometimes played at beggar - my - neighbour , "
27459	27477	27479	27479	he	101	" Ask Mrs Morgan for a pack of cards . Ruthie , I 'll teach you ťcartť , "
27551	27558	27560	27560	he	101	" You 're pale , love ! "
27574	27615	27560	27560	he	101	" Go out before dinner ; you know you do n't mind this cursed weather ; and see that you come home full of adventures to relate . Come , little blockhead ! give me a kiss , and begone . "
28017	28036	28012	28012	he	1117	" The water is very rapid ; will you take my hand ? Perhaps I can help you . "
28171	28239	28240	28240	They	1121	" Will you allow me to accompany you if you are going the round by Cwm Dhu , as I imagine you are ? The hand - rail is blown away from the little wooden bridge by the storm last night , and the rush of waters below may make you dizzy ; and it is really dangerous to fall there , the stream is so deep . "
28317	28324	28326	28326	he	1117	" I only came here yesterday , "
28340	28355	28326	28326	he	1117	" Last night I went to the higher waterfalls ; they are most splendid . "
28356	28366	28368	28368	Ruth	87	" Did you go out in all that rain ? "
28372	28418	28326	28326	he	1117	" Oh , yes . Rain never hinders me from walking . Indeed , it gives a new beauty to such a country as this . Besides , my time for my excursion is so short , I can not afford to waste a day . "
28419	28428	28430	28430	Ruth	87	" Then , you do not live here ? "
28432	28461	28326	28326	he	1117	" No ! my home is in a very different place . I live in a busy town , where at times it is difficult to feel the truth that
28535	28535	28636	28636	his	1137	"
28536	28545	28547	28547	Ruth	87	" I do not wonder at your choice , "
28549	28556	28547	28547	Ruth	87	" It is a beautiful country . "
28557	28618	28636	28636	his	1137	" It is , indeed ; and I have been inoculated by an old innkeeper at Conway with a love for its people , and history , and traditions . I have picked up enough of the language to understand many of their legends ; and some are very fine and awe - inspiring , others very poetic and fanciful . "
28645	28649	28651	28651	he	1137	" For instance , "
28689	28723	28724	28724	He	1137	" I dare say , you do n't know what makes this fox - glove bend and sway so gracefully . You think it is blown by the wind , do n't you ? "
28750	28763	28765	28765	Ruth	87	" I always thought it was the wind . What is it ? "
28769	28843	28882	28882	he	1137	" Oh , the Welsh tell you that this flower is sacred to the fairies , and that it has the power of recognising them , and all spiritual beings who pass by , and that it bows in deference to them as they waft along . Its Welsh name is Maneg Ellyllyn the good people 's glove ; and hence , I imagine , our folk's - glove or fox - glove . "
28844	28852	28854	28854	Ruth	87	" It 's a very pretty fancy , "
28942	28945	28947	28947	he	1137	" Ruth , "
28953	29006	28947	28947	he	1137	" I 've seen your little hunchback . He looks like Riquet - with - the - Tuft . He 's not a gentleman , though . If it had not been for his deformity , I should not have made him out from your description ; you called him a gentleman . "
29007	29015	29017	29017	Ruth	87	" And do n't you , sir ? "
29021	29082	28947	28947	he	1137	" Oh , no ! he 's regularly shabby and seedy in his appearance ; lodging , too , the ostler told me , over that horrible candle and cheese shop , the smell of which is insufferable twenty yards off no gentleman could endure it ; he must be a traveller or artist , or something of that kind . "
29083	29092	29094	29094	Ruth	87	" Did you see his face , sir ? "
29096	29117	28947	28947	he	1137	" No ; but a man 's back his tout ensemble has character enough in it to decide his rank . "
29118	29128	29130	29130	she	87	" His face was very singular ; quite beautiful ! "
29167	29175	28947	28947	he	1137	" bridal of the earth and sky ; "
29240	29248	29250	29251	one gentleman	1143	" She 's a very lovely creature , "
29274	29294	29250	29251	one gentleman	1143	" Not above sixteen , I should think . Very modest and innocent - looking in her white gown ! "
29327	29372	29295	29296	His wife	747	" Well ! I do think it 's a shame such people should be allowed to come here . To think of such wickedness under the same roof ! Do come away , my dear , and do n't flatter her by such notice . "
29420	29449	29417	29417	you	869	" Now , Harry , go and see if nurse and baby are ready to go out with you . You must lose no time this beautiful morning . "
29587	29592	29593	29593	she	87	" peep - boing , "
29632	29640	29642	29643	the nurse	1152	" Oh , for shame , sir ! "
29650	29669	29642	29643	the nurse	1152	" how dare you do that to the lady who is so kind as to speak to Sissy . "
29670	29677	29679	29679	he	135	" She 's not a lady ! "
29683	29705	29679	29679	he	135	" She 's a bad naughty girl mamma said so , she did ; and she sha n't kiss our baby . "
29740	29749	29751	29751	she	1152	" Children pick up such notions , ma'am , "
29776	29802	29804	29805	the boy	4407	" It 's no notion ; it 's true , nurse ; and I heard you say it yourself . Go away , naughty woman ! "
30030	30105	30008	30009	Mr Bellingham	101	" Ruth , what is the matter this morning ? You really are very provoking . Yesterday , when everything was gloomy , and you might have been aware that I was out of spirits , I heard nothing but expressions of delight ; to - day , when every creature under heaven is rejoicing , you look most deplorable and woe - begone . You really should learn to have a little sympathy . "
30200	30205	30207	30207	she	87	" I will not , "
30209	30246	30207	30207	she	87	" embitter his life ; I will try and be cheerful . I must not think of myself so much . If I can but make him happy , what need I care for chance speeches ? "
30629	30638	30640	30640	Ruth	87	" Oh , there are water - lilies , "
30650	30658	30640	30640	Ruth	87	" I must go and get some . "
30659	30692	30709	30709	he	1175	" No ; I will get them for you . The ground is spongy all round there . Sit still , Ruth ; this heap of grass will make a capital seat . "
30805	30834	30802	30802	he	1175	" There , Ruth ! now you 'll do . Come and look at yourself in the pond . Here , where there are no weeds . Come . "
31093	31098	31100	31100	he	1175	" Really , Ruth , "
31105	31161	31100	31100	he	1175	" you must not encourage yourself in this habit of falling into melancholy reveries without any cause . You have been sighing twenty times during the last half - hour . Do be a little cheerful . Remember , I have no companion but you in this out - of - the - way place . "
31162	31170	31172	31172	Ruth	87	" I am very sorry , sir , "
31216	31248	31207	31207	She	87	" Would you be so kind as to teach me one of those games at cards you were speaking about yesterday , sir ? I would do my best to learn . "
31298	31301	31303	31303	he	1175	" There ! "
31308	31342	31303	31303	he	1175	" that 's enough for one lesson . Do you know , little goose , your blunders have made me laugh myself into one of the worst headaches I have had for years . "
31360	31371	31372	31372	she	87	" Let me put my cool hands on your forehead , "
31375	31383	31372	31372	she	87	" that used to do mamma good . "
31563	31570	31558	31558	she	1189	" Iss , indeed , ma'am , "
31677	31681	31683	31683	she	87	" Mrs Morgan , "
31704	31717	31719	31719	she	87	" Mrs Morgan , I 'm afraid Mr Bellingham is very ill ; "
31729	31737	31739	31739	she	87	" Oh , what must I do ? "
31741	31765	31739	31739	she	87	" I do n't think he has known anything all through the night , and he looks so strange and wild this morning . "
31781	31835	31766	31766	She	87	" Indeed , miss , ma'am , and it 's a very awkward thing . But do n't cry , that can do no good , ' deed it ca n't . I 'll go and see the poor young man myself , and then I can judge if a doctor is wanting . "
31871	31886	31868	31868	he	101	" Ruth ! Ruth ! come here ; I wo n't be left alone ! "
31916	31947	31897	31898	Mrs Morgan	128	" I 'll send for Mr Jones , my dear , ' deed and I will ; we 'll have him here in a couple of hours , please God . "
31948	31957	31959	31959	Ruth	87	" Oh , ca n't he come sooner ? "
31965	32017	31897	31898	Mrs Morgan	128	" ' Deed no ; he lives at Llangl s when he 's at home , and that 's seven mile away , and he may be gone a round eight or nine mile on the other side Llangl s ; but I 'll send a boy on the pony directly . "
32288	32298	32300	32301	Mr Jones	137	" I am afraid this is a bad case , "
32308	32318	32300	32301	Mr Jones	137	" A brain - fever has evidently set in . "
32319	32336	32247	32247	him	101	" Poor young gentleman ! poor young man ! He looked the very picture of health ! "
32337	32396	32300	32301	Mr Jones	137	" That very appearance of robustness will , in all probability , make his disorder more violent . However , we must hope for the best , Mrs Morgan . Who is to attend upon him ? He will require careful nursing . Is that young lady his sister ? She looks too young to be his wife ? "
32397	32499	32551	32551	Ruth	87	" No , indeed ! Gentlemen like you must know , Mr Jones , that we ca n't always look too closely into the ways of young men who come to our houses . Not but what I 'm sorry for her , for she 's an innocent , inoffensive young creature . I always think it right , for my own morals , to put a little scorn into my manners when such as her come to stay here ; but , indeed , she 's so gentle , I 've found it hard work to show the proper contempt . "
32539	32543	32545	32546	Mrs Morgan	128	" Come in ! "
32581	32649	32562	32562	she	87	" I wish you , sir , to be so kind as to tell me , clearly and distinctly , what I must do for Mr Bellingham . Every direction you give me shall be most carefully attended to . You spoke about leeches I can put them on , and see about them . Tell me everything , sir , that you wish to have done ! "
32736	32743	32745	32746	Mr Jones	137	" She is no common person , "
32748	32776	32745	32746	Mr Jones	137	" Still she is too young to have the responsibility of such a serious case . Have you any idea where his friends live , Mrs Morgan ? "
32777	32896	32707	32707	she	87	" Indeed and I have . His mother , as haughty a lady as you would wish to see , came travelling through Wales last year ; she stopped here , and , I warrant you , nothing was good enough for her ; she was real quality . She left some clothes and books behind her for the maid was almost as fine as the mistress , and little thought of seeing after her lady 's clothes , having a taste for going to see scenery along with the man - servant , and we had several letters from her . I have them locked in the drawers in the bar , where I keep such things . "
32897	32917	32745	32746	Mr Jones	137	" Well ! I should recommend your writing to the lady , and telling her her son 's state . "
32918	32945	32707	32707	she	87	" It would be a favour , Mr Jones , if you would just write it yourself . English writing comes so strange to my pen . "
33154	33159	33161	33162	Mrs Morgan	128	" She 's come , "
33183	33188	33190	33190	Ruth	87	" Who is come ? "
33246	33259	33261	33261	she	87	" What must I do ? Will she be angry with me ? "
33524	33534	33536	33536	she	87	" If you please , may I come in ? "
33571	33590	33546	33546	she	91	" Will you tell me how he is ? Do you think I may go back to him ? "
33591	33704	33546	33546	she	91	" No , indeed , that you may not . Nest , who has made his room tidy these many days , is not fit to go in now . Mrs Bellingham has brought her own maid , and the family nurse , and Mr Bellingham 's man ; such a tribe of servants and no end to packages ; water - beds coming by the carrier , and a doctor from London coming down to - morrow , as if feather - beds and Mr Jones was not good enough . Why , she wo n't let a soul of us into the room ; there 's no chance for you ! "
33708	33713	33714	33714	she	87	" How is he ? "
33721	33884	33885	33885	Her	1237	" How can I tell indeed , when I 'm not allowed to go near him ? Mr Jones said to - night was a turning point ; but I doubt it , for it is four days since he was taken ill , and who ever heard of a sick person taking a turn on an even number of days ; it 's always on the third , or the fifth , or seventh , or so on . He 'll not turn till to - morrow night , take my word for it , and their fine London doctor will get all the credit , and honest Mr Jones will be thrown aside . I do n't think he will get better myself , though Gelert does not howl for nothing . My patience ! what 's the matter with the girl ? lord , child , you 're never going to faint , and be ill on my hands ? "
33933	33952	33953	33953	She	87	" You 've had no tea , I guess . Indeed , and the girls are very careless . "
34649	34652	34669	34669	She	87	" Cwm , "
35378	35385	35371	35371	She	87	" How is he , madam ? "
35528	35547	35524	35524	she	87	" For the love of God , madam , speak ! How is he ? Will he live ? "
35574	35584	35571	35571	she	87	" He has slept well : he is better . "
35585	35595	35597	35597	Ruth	87	" Oh ! my God , I thank Thee , "
35679	35706	35651	35652	Mrs Bellingham	103	" Young woman , if you have any propriety or decency left , I trust that you will not dare to force yourself into his room . "
35886	36006	35879	35879	she	87	" Indeed , miss , and you must not hang about the door in this way ; it is not pretty manners . Mrs Bellingham has been speaking very sharp and cross about it , and I shall lose the character of my inn if people take to talking as she does . Did not I give you a room last night to keep in , and never be seen or heard of ; and did I not tell you what a particular lady Mrs Bellingham was , but you must come out here right in her way ? Indeed , it was not pretty , nor grateful to me , Jenny Morgan , and that I must say . "
36056	36132	36048	36048	her	128	" You stop up here like a good girl . I 'll send you your breakfast by - and - by , and let you know from time to time how he is ; and you can go out for a walk , you know ; but if you do , I 'll take it as a favour if you 'll go out by the side door . It will , maybe , save scandal . "
36367	36372	36365	36366	Mrs Bellingham	103	" Does the Thing Handsomely "
36502	36512	36514	36514	she	103	" I think you are better to - day , "
36527	36537	36514	36514	she	103	" We shall get you downstairs to - morrow . "
36538	36582	36583	36583	He	101	" If it were to get away from this abominable place , I could go down to - day ; but I believe I 'm to be kept prisoner here for ever . I shall never get well here , I 'm sure . "
36673	36723	36654	36654	her	103	" Henry , there is something I must speak to you about ; an unpleasant subject , certainly , but one which has been forced upon me by the very girl herself ; you must be aware to what I refer without giving me the pain of explaining myself . "
36763	36767	36768	36768	she	103	" Of course , "
36771	36853	36768	36768	she	103	" it was my wish to be as blind to the whole affair as possible , though you ca n't imagine how Mrs Mason has blazoned it abroad ; all Fordham rings with it ; but of course it could not be pleasant , or , indeed , I may say correct , for me to be aware that a person of such improper character was under the same I beg your pardon , dear Henry , what do you say ? "
36854	36868	36924	36925	Mrs Bellingham	103	" Ruth is no improper character , mother ; you do her injustice ! "
36869	36887	36768	36768	she	103	" My dear boy , you do n't mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue ! "
36888	36900	36924	36925	Mrs Bellingham	103	" No , mother , but I led her wrong ; I "
36901	36922	36924	36925	Mrs Bellingham	103	" We will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her present character drop , if you please , "
36980	37025	36960	36960	He	996	" As I have implied , I do not wish to ascertain your share of blame ; from what I saw of her one morning , I am convinced of her forward , intrusive manners , utterly without shame , or even common modesty . "
37026	37033	37035	37036	Mr Bellingham	101	" What are you referring to ? "
37040	37116	36960	36960	He	996	" Why , when you were at the worst , and I had been watching you all night , and had just gone out in the morning for a breath of fresh air , this girl pushed herself before me , and insisted upon speaking to me . I really had to send Mrs Morgan to her before I could return to your room . A more impudent , hardened manner , I never saw . "
37117	37138	37035	37036	Mr Bellingham	101	" Ruth was neither impudent nor hardened ; she was ignorant enough , and might offend from knowing no better . "
37330	37403	37404	37404	She	663	" We may as well drop all dispute as to the young woman 's manners ; but I suppose you do not mean to defend your connexion with her ; I suppose you are not so lost to all sense of propriety as to imagine it fit or desirable that your mother and this degraded girl should remain under the same roof , liable to meet at any hour of the day ? "
37415	37432	37404	37404	She	663	" I ask you a simple question ; is it , or is it not desirable ? "
37433	37440	37441	37441	he	101	" I suppose it is not , "
37446	37478	37404	37404	She	663	" And I suppose , from your manner , that you think the difficulty would be best solved by my taking my departure , and leaving you with your vicious companion ? "
37503	37651	37500	37500	he	101	" Mother , you are not helping me in my difficulty . I have no desire to banish you , nor to hurt you , after all your care for me . Ruth has not been so much to blame as you imagine , that I must say ; but I do not wish to see her again , if you can tell me how to arrange it otherwise , without behaving unhandsomely . Only spare me all this worry while I am so weak . I put myself in your hands . Dismiss her , as you wish it ; but let it be done handsomely , and let me hear no more about it ; I can not bear it ; let me have a quiet life , without being lectured while I am pent up here , and unable to shake off unpleasant thoughts . "
37652	37661	37404	37404	She	663	" My dear Henry , rely upon me . "
37662	37694	37500	37500	he	101	" No more , mother ; it 's a bad business , and I can hardly avoid blaming myself in the matter ; I do n't want to dwell upon it . "
37695	37803	37404	37404	She	663	" Do n't be too severe in your self - reproaches while you are so feeble , dear Henry ; it is right to repent , but I have no doubt in my own mind she led you wrong with her artifices . But , as you say , everything should be done handsomely . I confess I was deeply grieved when I first heard of the affair , but since I have seen the girl Well ! I 'll say no more about her , since I see it displeases you ; but I am thankful to God that you see the error of your ways . "
37837	37840	37841	37841	he	996	" Mother , "
37844	37862	37841	37841	he	996	" this affair worries me to death . I can not shake off the thoughts of it . "
37863	37875	37804	37804	She	1319	" Leave it to me , I 'll arrange it satisfactorily . "
37876	37925	37841	37841	he	996	" Could we not leave to - night ? I should not be so haunted by this annoyance in another place . I dread seeing her again , because I fear a scene ; and yet I believe I ought to see her , in order to explain . "
37926	37938	37940	37940	she	1319	" You must not think of such a thing , Henry , "
37948	38023	37940	37940	she	1319	" Sooner than that , we will leave in half an hour , and try to get to Pen tre Voelas to - night . It is not yet three , and the evenings are very long . Simpson should stay and finish the packing ; she could go straight to London and meet us there . Macdonald and nurse could go with us . Could you bear twenty miles , do you think ? "
38086	38092	38075	38076	his mother	663	" do the thing handsomely , "
38501	38543	38464	38464	She	0	" Iss , indeed , miss ; the carriage drove from the door as I came upstairs . You 'll see it now on the Yspytty road , if you 'll please to come to the window of No . 24 . "
39202	39207	39208	39208	she	87	" Oh , perhaps , "
39211	39254	39208	39208	she	87	" I have been too hasty . There may be some words of explanation from him on the other side of the page , to which , in my blind anguish , I never turned . I will go and find it . "
39649	39656	39635	39640	one more adventurous than the rest	1379	" Gi ' me a halfpenny , "
39751	39758	39759	39759	She	87	" Gi ' me a halfpenny . "
40006	40026	40000	40000	she	1388	" He has left me , sir ! sir , he has indeed he has gone and left me ! "
40141	40155	40134	40134	himself	1386	" Oh , my God ! for Christ 's sake , pity her ! "
40670	40675	40677	40677	he	1386	" I am hurt , "
40679	40685	40677	40677	he	1386	" do not leave me ; "
40795	40808	40791	40791	she	87	" Are you better , sir ? are you very much hurt ? "
40809	40866	40791	40791	she	87	" Not very much ; I am better . Any quick movement is apt to cause me a sudden loss of power in my back , and I believe I stumbled over some of these projecting stones . It will soon go off , and you will help me to go home , I am sure . "
40867	40895	40791	40791	she	87	" Oh , yes ! Can you go now ? I am afraid of your lying too long on this heather ; there is a heavy dew . "
40939	40951	40936	40936	she	87	" Do n't hurry yourself , sir ; I can wait . "
41073	41082	41084	41084	he	1386	" Can you help me to rise now ? "
41209	41213	41215	41215	he	1386	" Come in , "
41684	41742	41743	41743	He	149	" My dear young lady , I have much to say to you ; and God has taken my strength from me now when I most need it . Oh , I sin to speak so but , for His sake , I implore you to be patient here , if only till to - morrow morning . "
41778	41783	41785	41785	he	149	" God help me , "
41789	41797	41785	41785	he	149	" my words do not touch her ; "
41852	41857	41818	41818	his	149	" for His sake , "
41877	41886	41873	41875	the merciful God	110	" What have I to do with Thee ? "
41922	41951	41919	41919	he	149	" In your mother 's name , whether she be dead or alive , I command you to stay here until I am able to speak to you . "
41987	42008	41984	41984	he	149	" I know you will not go you could not for her sake . You will not , will you ? "
42009	42012	42014	42014	Ruth	87	" No , "
42046	42057	42059	42059	he	149	" And now you will do what I tell you , "
42090	42093	42086	42086	She	87	" Yes . "
42111	42190	42191	42191	His	1427	" You have a bedroom within yours , where your daughter used to sleep , I think ? I am sure you will oblige me , and I shall consider it as a great favour , if you will allow this young lady to sleep there to - night . Will you take her there now ? Go , my dear . I have full trust in your promise not to leave until I can speak to you . "
42401	42427	42389	42389	She	148	" Please , sir , I think the young lady is very ill indeed , sir ; perhaps you would please to come to her . "
42428	42434	42436	42436	he	1427	" How is she ill ? "
42441	42464	42389	42389	She	148	" Quite quiet - like , sir ; but I think she is dying , that 's all , indeed , sir ! "
42465	42476	42477	42477	he	1427	" Go away , I will be with you directly ! "
42645	42652	42654	42654	he	149	" You gave her some food ? "
42662	42732	42654	42654	he	149	" Indeed , and I offered her the best in the house , but she shook her poor pretty head , and only asked if I would please to get her a cup of water . I brought her some milk though , and ' deed , I think she 'd rather have had the water ; but not to seem sour and cross , she took some milk . "
42742	42751	42654	42654	he	149	" When does the doctor come up here ? "
42752	42772	42654	42654	he	149	" Indeed , sir , and he 's up nearly every day now , the inn is so full . "
42773	42818	42654	42654	he	149	" I 'll go for him . And can you manage to undress her and lay her in bed ? Open the window too , and let in the air ; if her feet are cold , put bottles of hot water to them . "
42864	42868	42860	42861	Mrs Hughes	148	" a blessing . "
42869	42881	42860	42861	Mrs Hughes	148	" It blesseth him that gives , and him that takes . "
43164	43341	43157	43158	Mrs Morgan	128	" Mr Jones will come this afternoon . But it is a shame you should be troubled with such as her . I had but little time yesterday , but I guessed there was something wrong , and Gwen has just been telling me her bed has not been slept in . They were in a pretty hurry to be gone yesterday , for all that the gentleman was not fit to travel , to my way of thinking ; indeed , William Wynn , the post - boy , said he was weary enough before he got to the end of that Yspytty road ; and he thought they would have to rest there a day or two before they could go further than Pen tre Voelas . Indeed , and anyhow , the servant is to follow them with the baggage this very morning ; and now I remember , William Wynn said they would wait for her . You 'd better write a note , Mr Benson , and tell them her state . "
43429	43463	43464	43464	She	1445	" Leave the note on this shelf , and trust me that it goes by the maid . The boy that drives her there in the car shall bring you an answer back . "
43976	43992	43973	43973	his	4409	" a thorough prostration of strength , occasioned by some great shock on the nerves , "
44205	44218	44219	44219	she	103	" Simpson , would you go and nurse this creature , as this "
44224	44234	44219	44219	she	103	" Mr Benson , whoever he is , proposes ? "
44235	44244	44246	44247	the maid	4737	" Me ! no , indeed , ma'am , "
44258	44287	44246	44247	the maid	4737	" I 'm sure , ma'am , you would not expect it of me ; I could never have the face to dress a lady of character again . "
44288	44340	44342	44342	she	4737	" Well , well ! do n't be alarmed ; I can not spare you ; by the way , just attend to the strings on my dress ; the chambermaid here pulled them into knots , and broke them terribly , last night . It is awkward though , very , "
44355	44396	44246	44247	the maid	4737	" If you 'll allow me , ma'am , I think I might say something that would alter the case . I believe , ma'am , you put a bank - note into the letter to the young woman yesterday ? "
44408	44488	44403	44404	the maid	4737	" Because , ma'am , when the little deformed man wrote that note he 's Mr Benson , ma'am , I have reason to believe neither he nor Mrs Morgan knew of any provision being made for the young woman . Me and the chambermaid found your letter and the bank - note lying quite promiscuous , like waste paper , on the floor of her room ; for I believe she rushed out like mad after you left . "
44489	44540	44403	44404	the maid	4737	" That , as you say , alters the case . This letter , then , is principally a sort of delicate hint that some provision ought to have been made , which is true enough , only it has been attended to already ; what became of the money ? "
44541	44578	44403	44404	the maid	4737	" Law , ma'am ! do you ask ? Of course , as soon as I saw it , I picked it up and took it to Mrs Morgan , in trust for the young person . "
44579	44607	44403	44404	the maid	4737	" Oh , that 's right . What friends has she ? Did you ever hear from Mason ? perhaps they ought to know where she is . "
44608	44780	44403	44404	the maid	4737	" Mrs Mason did tell me , ma'am , she was an orphan ; with a guardian who was no - ways akin , and who washed his hands of her when she ran off ; but Mrs Mason was sadly put out , and went into hysterics , for fear you would think she had not seen after her enough , and that she might lose your custom ; she said it was no fault of hers , for the girl was always a forward creature , boasting of her beauty , and saying how pretty she was , and striving to get where her good looks could be seen and admired , one night in particular , ma'am , at a county ball ; and how Mrs Mason had found out she used to meet Mr Bellingham at an old woman 's house , who was a regular old witch , ma'am , and lives in the lowest part of the town , where all the bad characters haunt . "
44781	44788	44790	44791	Mrs Bellingham	103	" There ! that 's enough , "
44859	44943	44824	44824	she	103	" If she has no friends , and is the creature you describe which is confirmed by my own observation , the best place for her is , as I said before , the Penitentiary . Her fifty pounds will keep her for a week or so , if she is really unable to travel , and pay for her journey ; and if on her return to Fordham she will let me know , I will undertake to obtain her admission immediately . "
44944	44973	44974	44975	Mrs Bellingham	103	" I 'm sure it 's well for her she has to do with a lady who will take any interest in her , after what has happened . "
45164	45178	45184	45184	she	103	" Take care Mr Bellingham hears nothing of this Mr Benson 's note , "
45192	45210	45184	45184	she	103	" he is so sensitive just now that it would annoy him sadly , I am sure . "
46206	46237	46195	46195	she	4724	" Thurstan , you are looking pale ! I do not believe you are well , whatever you may say . Have you had the old pain in your back ? "
46238	46263	46284	46284	he	149	" No a little never mind that , dearest Faith . Sit down here , while I send the boy up with your box . "
46316	46320	46310	46310	his	4407	" Dim Saesoneg . "
46330	46360	46322	46322	he	149	" Well now , Thurstan , here I sit as you bid me . But do n't try me too long ; tell me why you sent for me . "
46435	46464	46465	46465	He	988	" It is an awkward story to tell , Faith , but there is a young woman lying ill at my lodgings whom I wanted you to nurse . "
46489	46513	46483	46483	her	4724	" Nothing very romantic , I hope , Thurstan . Remember , I can not stand much romance ; I always distrust it . "
46514	46543	46465	46465	He	988	" I do n't know what you mean by romance . The story is real enough , and not out of the common way , I 'm afraid . "
46555	46603	46544	46544	He	988	" Well , tell it me at once , Thurstan . I am afraid you have let some one , or perhaps only your own imagination , impose upon you ; but do n't try my patience too much ; you know I 've no great stock . "
46604	46643	46544	46544	He	988	" Then I 'll tell you . The young girl was brought to the inn here by a gentleman , who has left her ; she is very ill , and has no one to see after her . "
46689	46697	46698	46698	she	1553	" Have you sent for her friends ? "
46703	46708	46681	46681	Her	1553	" She has none . "
46725	46731	46681	46681	Her	1553	" How is she ill ? "
46732	46755	46681	46681	Her	1553	" Pretty nearly as quiet as if she were dead . She does not speak , or move , or even sigh . "
46756	46771	46681	46681	Her	1553	" It would be better for her to die at once , I think . "
46772	46775	46681	46681	Her	1553	" Faith ! "
46889	46900	46886	46886	she	1553	" Thurstan , dear , let us go to her . "
47070	47095	47065	47065	she	1553	" Mr Bradshaw has refused to let the children associate with the Dixons any longer , because one evening they played at acting charades . "
47096	47108	47173	47174	Mr Benson	149	" Indeed ; a little more bread and butter , Faith ? "
47109	47141	47065	47065	she	1553	" Thank you . This Welsh air does make one hungry . Mrs Bradshaw is paying poor old Maggie 's rent , to save her from being sent into the workhouse . "
47142	47156	47173	47174	Mr Benson	149	" That 's right . Wo n't you have another cup of tea ? "
47157	47172	47065	47065	she	1553	" I have had two . However , I think I 'll take another . "
47248	47258	47243	47244	Miss Benson	149	" Now , will you go and see her ? "
47259	47262	47268	47269	Mrs Hughes	148	" Yes . "
47416	47424	47426	47426	he	149	" Do you think she will live ? "
47428	47434	47436	47437	Miss Benson	149	" I can not tell , "
47444	47480	47436	47437	Miss Benson	149	" But how young she looks ! Quite a child , poor creature ! When will the doctor come , Thurstan ? Tell me all about her ; you have never told me the particulars . "
47574	47582	47584	47584	she	4724	" And what does the doctor say ? "
47590	47631	47584	47584	she	4724	" He insists upon quiet ; he orders medicines and strong broth . I can not tell you all ; Mrs Hughes can . She has been so truly good . ' Doing good , hoping for nothing again . ' "
47632	47725	47584	47584	she	4724	" She looks very sweet and gentle . I shall sit up to - night and watch her myself ; and I shall send you and Mrs Hughes early to bed , for you have both a worn look about you I do n't like . Are you sure the effect of that fall has gone off ? Do you feel anything of it in your back still ? After all , I owe her something for turning back to your help . Are you sure she was going to drown herself ? "
47726	47774	47584	47584	she	4724	" I can not be sure , for I have not questioned her . She has not been in a state to be questioned ; but I have no doubt whatever about it . But you must not think of sitting up after your journey , Faith . "
47775	47791	47584	47584	she	4724	" Answer me , Thurstan . Do you feel any bad effect from that fall ? "
47792	47809	47584	47584	she	4724	" No , hardly any . Do n't sit up , Faith , to - night ! "
47810	47922	47584	47584	she	4724	" Thurstan , it 's no use talking , for I shall ; and , if you go on opposing me , I dare say I shall attack your back , and put a blister on it . Do tell me what that ' hardly any ' means . Besides , to set you quite at ease , you know I have never seen mountains before , and they fill me and oppress me so much that I could not sleep ; I must keep awake this first night , and see that they do n't fall on the earth and overwhelm it . And now answer my questions about yourself . "
48124	48129	48131	48131	Ruth	87	" Who are you ? "
48139	48147	48148	48148	she	1580	" Miss Benson Mr Benson 's sister , "
48236	48265	48221	48222	Miss Benson	149	" Do n't be afraid , dear ; I 'm a friend come to take care of you . Would you like some tea now , my love ? "
48683	48694	48676	48677	his sister	4724	" What does the doctor say ? Is she better ? "
48695	48704	48706	48707	Miss Benson	149	" Oh , yes ! she 's better , "
48751	48765	48744	48745	Miss Benson	149	" What is the matter , Faith ? You say she is better . "
48766	48786	48744	48745	Miss Benson	149	" Why , Thurstan , there is something so shocking the matter , that I can not tell you . "
48810	48815	48807	48807	I	0	" all things possible ; "
48833	48853	48855	48855	he	149	" Faith , I wish you would tell me , and not bewilder me with those noises of yours , "
48859	48892	48821	48821	He	149	" I beg your pardon ; but something so shocking has just been discovered I do n't know how to word it She will have a child . The doctor says so . "
48918	48940	48821	48821	He	149	" Is n't it shocking , Thurstan ? You might have knocked me down with a straw when he told me . "
48941	48946	48821	48821	He	149	" Does she know ? "
48947	48965	48821	48821	He	149	" Yes ; and I am not sure that that is n't the worst part of all . "
48966	48974	48821	48821	He	149	" How ? what do you mean ? "
48975	49172	48821	48821	He	149	" Oh ! I was just beginning to have a good opinion of her , but I 'm afraid she is very depraved . After the doctor was gone , she pulled the bed - curtain aside , and looked as if she wanted to speak to me . I ca n't think how she heard , for we were close to the window , and spoke very low . Well , I went to her , though I really had taken quite a turn against her . And she whispered , quite eagerly , ' Did he say I should have a baby ? ' Of course , I could not keep it from her ; but I thought it my duty to look as cold and severe as I could . She did not seem to understand how it ought to be viewed , but took it just as if she had a right to have a baby . She said , ' Oh , my God , I thank Thee ! Oh ! I will be so good ! ' I had no patience with her then , so I left the room . "
49173	49179	48821	48821	He	149	" Who is with her ? "
49180	49201	48821	48821	He	149	" Mrs Hughes . She is not seeing the thing in a moral light , as I should have expected . "
49214	49234	49211	49211	he	149	" Faith , I do n't see this affair quite as you do . I believe I am right . "
49235	49248	49211	49211	he	149	" You surprise me , brother ! I do n't understand you . "
49249	49279	49211	49211	he	149	" Wait awhile ! I want to make my feelings very clear to you , but I do n't know where to begin , or how to express myself . "
49280	49318	49211	49211	he	149	" It is , indeed , an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk about ; but if once I get clear of this girl , I 'll wash my hands of all such cases again . "
49336	49350	49327	49327	he	988	" Faith , do you know I rejoice in this child 's advent ? "
49351	49379	49327	49327	he	988	" May God forgive you , Thurstan ! if you know what you are saying . But , surely , it is a temptation , dear Thurstan . "
49380	49403	49327	49327	he	988	" I do not think it is a delusion . The sin appears to me to be quite distinct from its consequences . "
49404	49410	49412	49413	Miss Benson	149	" Sophistry and a temptation , "
49417	49424	49426	49427	her brother	988	" No , it is not , "
49433	49466	49426	49427	her brother	988	" In the eye of God , she is exactly the same as if the life she has led had left no trace behind . We knew her errors before , Faith . "
49467	49480	49327	49327	he	988	" Yes , but not this disgrace this badge of her shame ! "
49481	49621	49426	49427	her brother	988	" Faith , Faith ! let me beg of you not to speak so of the little innocent babe , who may be God 's messenger to lead her back to Him . Think again of her first words the burst of nature from her heart ! Did she not turn to God , and enter into a covenant with Him ' I will be so good ? ' Why , it draws her out of herself ! If her life has hitherto been self - seeking , and wickedly thoughtless , here is the very instrument to make her forget herself , and be thoughtful for another . Teach her and God will teach her , if man does not come between to reverence her child ; and this reverence will shut out sin , will be purification . "
49658	49667	49669	49670	Miss Benson	149	" These are quite new ideas to me , "
49674	49710	49669	49670	Miss Benson	149	" I think you , Thurstan , are the first person I ever heard rejoicing over the birth of an illegitimate child . It appears to me , I must own , rather questionable morality . "
49711	49841	49854	49854	she	4724	" I do not rejoice . I have been all this afternoon mourning over the sin which has blighted this young creature ; I have been dreading lest , as she recovered consciousness , there should be a return of her despair . I have been thinking of every holy word , every promise to the penitent of the tenderness which led the Magdalen aright . I have been feeling , severely and reproachfully , the timidity which has hitherto made me blink all encounter with evils of this particular kind . Oh , Faith ! once for all , do not accuse me of questionable morality , when I am trying more than ever I did in my life to act as my blessed Lord would have done . "
49861	49892	49854	49854	she	4724	" But , Thurstan , everything might have been done to ' lead her right ' as you call it , without this child , this miserable offspring of sin . "
49893	49996	49854	49854	she	4724	" The world has , indeed , made such children miserable , innocent as they are ; but I doubt if this be according to the will of God , unless it be His punishment for the parents ' guilt ; and even then the world 's way of treatment is too apt to harden the mother 's natural love into something like hatred . Shame , and the terror of friends ' displeasure , turn her mad defile her holiest instincts ; and , as for the fathers God forgive them ! I can not at least , not just now . "
50011	50031	50008	50008	she	1612	" Thurstan remember I 'm not convinced , how would you have this girl treated according to your theory ? "
50032	50075	50076	50076	He	988	" It will require some time , and much Christian love , to find out the best way . I know I 'm not very wise ; but the way I think it would be right to act in , would be this "
50089	50186	50082	50082	he	988	" She has incurred a responsibility that we both acknowledge . She is about to become a mother , and have the direction and guidance of a little tender life . I fancy such a responsibility must be serious and solemn enough , without making it into a heavy and oppressive burden , so that human nature recoils from bearing it . While we do all we can to strengthen her sense of responsibility , I would likewise do all we can to make her feel that it is responsibility for what may become a blessing . "
50187	50196	50198	50199	Miss Benson	149	" Whether the children are legitimate or illegitimate ? "
50203	50206	50208	50209	her brother	988	" Yes ! "
50213	50230	50232	50232	he	988	" The more I think , the more I believe I am right . No one , "
50240	50281	50232	50232	he	988	" can have a greater recoil from profligacy than I have . You yourself have not greater sorrow over this young creature 's sin than I have : the difference is this , you confuse the consequences with the sin . "
50282	50289	50237	50237	he	988	" I do n't understand metaphysics . "
50290	50393	50232	50232	he	988	" I am not aware that I am talking metaphysics . I can imagine that if the present occasion be taken rightly , and used well , all that is good in her may be raised to a height unmeasured but by God ; while all that is evil and dark may , by His blessing , fade and disappear in the pure light of her child 's presence . Oh , Father ! listen to my prayer , that her redemption may date from this time . Help us to speak to her in the loving spirit of thy Holy Son ! "
50459	50464	50466	50466	she	4724	" The poor child ! "
50470	50536	50466	50466	she	4724	" the poor , poor child ! what it will have to struggle through and endure ! Do you remember Thomas Wilkins , and the way he threw the registry of his birth and baptism back in your face ? Why , he would not have the situation ; he went to sea and was drowned , rather than present the record of his shame . "
50537	50592	50603	50603	she	1618	" I do remember it all . It has often haunted me . She must strengthen her child to look to God , rather than to man 's opinion . It will be the discipline , the penance , she has incurred . She must teach it to be humanly speaking self - dependent . "
50593	50598	50600	50601	Miss Benson	149	" But after all , "
50626	50644	50603	50603	she	1618	" after all , it might be concealed . The very child need never know its illegitimacy . "
50645	50648	50650	50651	her brother	988	" How ? "
50653	50695	50698	50698	tempter	1620	" Why we know so little about her yet ; but in that letter , it said she had no friends ; now , could she not go into quite a fresh place , and be passed off as a widow ? "
50881	50890	50837	50837	Cain	161	" How could it be managed , Faith ? "
50891	50925	50951	50951	Ruth	87	" Nay , I must know much more , which she alone can tell us , before I can see how it is to be managed . It is certainly the best plan . "
50926	50931	50933	50934	her brother	988	" Perhaps it is , "
51094	51104	51086	51086	she	628	" That young creature 's name is Ruth Hilton . "
51105	51115	51086	51086	she	628	" Indeed ! how did you find it out ? "
51116	51201	51086	51086	she	628	" From herself , of course . She is much stronger . I slept with her last night , and I was aware she was awake long before I liked to speak , but at last I began . I do n't know what I said , or how it went on , but I think it was a little relief to her to tell me something about herself . She sobbed and cried herself to sleep ; I think she is asleep now . "
51202	51211	51086	51086	she	628	" Tell me what she said about herself . "
51212	51355	51086	51086	she	628	" Oh , it was really very little ; it was evidently a most painful subject . She is an orphan , without brother or sister , and with a guardian , whom , I think she said , she never saw but once . He apprenticed her after her father 's death to a dressmaker . This Mr Bellingham got acquainted with her , and they used to meet on Sunday afternoons . One day they were late , lingering on the road , when the dressmaker came up by accident . She seems to have been very angry , and not unnaturally so . The girl took fright at her threats , and the lover persuaded her to go off with him to London , there and then . Last May , I think it was . That 's all . "
51356	51366	51086	51086	she	628	" Did she express any sorrow for her error ? "
51367	51479	51086	51086	she	628	" No , not in words , but her voice was broken with sobs , though she tried to make it steady . After a while she began to talk about her baby , but shyly , and with much hesitation . She asked me how much I thought she could earn as a dressmaker , by working very , very hard ; and that brought us round to her child . I thought of what you had said , Thurstan , and I tried to speak to her as you wished me . I am not sure if it was right ; I am doubtful in my own mind still . "
51480	51498	51086	51086	she	628	" Do n't be doubtful , Faith ! Dear Faith , I thank you for your kindness . "
51499	51537	51086	51086	she	628	" There is really nothing to thank me for . It is almost impossible to help being kind to her ; there is something so meek and gentle about her , so patient , and so grateful ! "
51538	51546	51086	51086	she	628	" What does she think of doing ? "
51547	51646	51086	51086	she	628	" Poor child ! she thinks of taking lodgings very cheap ones , she says ; there she means to work night and day to earn enough for her child . For , she said to me , with such pretty earnestness , ' It must never know want , whatever I do . I have deserved suffering , but it will be such a little innocent darling ! ' Her utmost earnings would not be more than seven or eight shillings a week , I 'm afraid ; and then she is so young and so pretty ! "
51647	51670	51086	51086	she	628	" There is that fifty pounds Mrs Morgan brought me , and those two letters . Does she know about them yet ? "
51671	51730	51086	51086	she	628	" No ; I did not like to tell her till she is a little stronger . Oh , Thurstan ! I wish there was not this prospect of a child . I can not help it . I do I could see a way in which we might help her , if it were not for that . "
51731	51737	51086	51086	she	628	" How do you mean ? "
51738	51831	51086	51086	she	628	" Oh , it 's no use thinking of it , as it is ! Or else we might have taken her home with us , and kept her till she had got a little dress - making in the congregation , but for this meddlesome child ; that spoils everything . You must let me grumble to you , Thurstan . I was very good to her , and spoke as tenderly and respectfully of the little thing as if it were the Queen 's , and born in lawful matrimony . "
51832	51877	51086	51086	she	628	" That 's right , my dear Faith ! Grumble away to me , if you like . I 'll forgive you , for the kind thought of taking her home with us . But do you think her situation is an insuperable objection ? "
51878	51897	51086	51086	she	628	" Why , Thurstan ! it 's so insuperable , it puts it quite out of the question . "
51898	51916	51086	51086	she	628	" How ? that 's only repeating your objection . Why is it out of the question ? "
51917	51961	51086	51086	she	628	" If there had been no child coming , we might have called her by her right name Miss Hilton ; that 's one thing . Then , another is , the baby in our house . Why , Sally would go distraught ! "
51962	51980	51982	51982	he	1636	" Never mind Sally . If she were an orphan relation of our own , left widowed , "
51991	52048	51982	51982	he	1636	" You yourself suggested she should be considered as a widow , for the child 's sake . I 'm only taking up your ideas , dear Faith . I respect you for thinking of taking her home ; it is just what we ought to do . Thank you for reminding me of my duty . "
52049	52076	51086	51086	she	628	" Nay , it was only a passing thought . Think of Mr Bradshaw . Oh ! I tremble at the thought of his grim displeasure . "
52077	52149	51982	51982	he	1636	" We must think of a higher than Mr Bradshaw . I own I should be a very coward , if he knew . He is so severe , so inflexible . But after all he sees so little of us ; he never comes to tea , you know , but is always engaged when Mrs Bradshaw comes . I do n't think he knows of what our household consists . "
52150	52217	51086	51086	she	628	" Not know Sally ? Oh yes , but he does . He asked Mrs Bradshaw one day , if she knew what wages we gave her , and said we might get a far more efficient and younger servant for the money . And , speaking about money , think what our expenses would be if we took her home for the next six months . "
52265	52272	52274	52274	he	988	" There 's the fifty pounds , "
52285	52294	52304	52304	her	4724	" Yes , there 's the fifty pounds , "
52307	52314	52304	52304	her	4724	" I suppose it is hers . "
52315	52354	52304	52304	her	4724	" I suppose it is ; and being so , we must not think who gave it to her . It will defray her expenses . I am very sorry , but I think we must take it . "
52355	52369	52371	52372	Miss Benson	149	" It would never do to apply to him under the present circumstances , "
52379	52387	52389	52390	her brother	988	" No , that we wo n't , "
52394	52443	52389	52390	her brother	988	" If she consents to let us take care of her , we will never let her stoop to request anything from him , even for his child . She can live on bread and water . We can all live on bread and water rather than that . "
52444	52508	52389	52389	her	1638	" Then I will speak to her and propose the plan . Oh , Thurstan ! from a child you could persuade me to anything ! I hope I am doing right . However much I oppose you at first , I am sure to yield soon ; almost in proportion to my violence at first . I think I am very weak . "
52509	52560	52389	52390	her brother	988	" No , not in this instance . We are both right : I , in the way in which the child ought to be viewed ; you , dear good Faith , for thinking of taking her home with us . God bless you , dear , for it ! "
52613	52623	52625	52625	she	87	" Do you recollect receiving this letter , Ruth ? "
52729	52745	52685	52685	she	87	" If you please , Miss Benson , I should like to return this money . "
52746	52752	52685	52685	she	87	" Why , my dear ? "
52753	52766	52768	52768	she	87	" I have a strong feeling against taking it . While he , "
52786	52874	52768	52768	she	87	" loved me , he gave me many things my watch oh , many things ; and I took them from him gladly and thankfully because he loved me for I would have given him anything and I thought of them as signs of love . But this money pains my heart . He has left off loving me , and has gone away . This money seems oh , Miss Benson it seems as if he could comfort me , for being forsaken , by money . "
52915	52931	52895	52895	She	87	" So , will you take the trouble of sending it back to Mrs Bellingham ? "
52932	52971	52895	52895	She	87	" That I will , my dear . I am glad of it , that I am ! They do n't deserve to have the power of giving : they do n't deserve that you should take it . "
52992	52997	52972	52973	Miss Benson	149	" From Ruth Hilton . "
52998	53009	53011	53011	she	87	" And now we wash our hands of these Bellinghams , "
53186	53227	53173	53174	her brother	988	" I admired her at the time for sending away her fifty pounds so proudly ; but I think she has a cold heart : she hardly thanked me at all for my proposal of taking her home with us . "
53228	53268	53173	53174	her brother	988	" Her thoughts are full of other things just now ; and people have such different ways of showing feeling : some by silence , some by words . At any rate , it is unwise to expect gratitude . "
53269	53279	53173	53174	her brother	988	" What do you expect not indifference or ingratitude ? "
53280	53401	53173	53174	her brother	988	" It is better not to expect or calculate consequences . The longer I live , the more fully I see that . Let us try simply to do right actions , without thinking of the feelings they are to call out in others . We know that no holy or self - denying effort can fall to the ground vain and useless ; but the sweep of eternity is large , and God alone knows when the effect is to be produced . We are trying to do right now , and to feel right ; do n't let us perplex ourselves with endeavouring to map out how she should feel , or how she should show her feelings . "
53402	53416	53418	53419	Miss Benson	149	" That 's all very fine , and I dare say very true , "
53425	53542	53418	53419	Miss Benson	149	" But ' a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ; ' and I would rather have had one good , hearty ' Thank you , ' now , for all I have been planning to do for her , than the grand effects you promise me in the ' sweep of eternity . ' Do n't be grave and sorrowful , Thurstan , or I 'll go out of the room . I can stand Sally 's scoldings , but I ca n't bear your look of quiet depression whenever I am a little hasty or impatient . I had rather you would give me a good box on the ear . "
53543	53595	53173	53174	her brother	988	" And I would often rather you would speak , if ever so hastily , instead of whistling . So , if I box your ears when I am vexed with you , will you promise to scold me when you are put out of the way , instead of whistling ? "
53596	53667	53418	53419	Miss Benson	149	" Very well ! that 's a bargain . You box , and I scold . But , seriously , I began to calculate our money when she so cavalierly sent off the fifty - pound note I ca n't help admiring her for it , and I am very much afraid we shall not have enough to pay the doctor 's bill , and take her home with us . "
53668	53679	53681	53682	Mr Benson	149	" She must go inside the coach whatever we do , "
53686	53702	53681	53682	Mr Benson	149	" Who 's there ? Come in ! Oh ! Mrs Hughes ! Sit down . "
53703	53771	53418	53419	Miss Benson	149	" Indeed , sir , and I can not stay ; but the young lady has just made me find up her watch for her , and asked me to get it sold to pay the doctor , and the little things she has had since she came ; and please , sir , indeed , I do n't know where to sell it nearer than Carnarvon . "
53772	53779	53781	53782	Miss Benson	149	" That is good of her , "
53820	53832	53834	53835	her brother	988	" And her goodness just helps us out of our dilemma , "
53886	53951	53882	53882	her	148	" Mr Jones , the doctor , is going to be married , perhaps he would like nothing better than to give this pretty watch to his bride ; indeed , and I think it 's very likely ; and he 'll pay money for it as well as letting alone his bill . I 'll ask him , sir , at any rate . "
53981	53987	53972	53972	He	137	" paid money for it ; "
54035	54047	54049	54050	Miss Benson	149	" Would you object to my buying you a black gown ? "
54072	54107	54062	54062	She	148	" My brother and I think it would be better to call you as if in fact you were a widow . It will save much awkwardness , and it will spare your child much "
54152	54169	54171	54171	she	148	" Oh , yes ! certainly . Thank you much for thinking of it . Indeed , "
54181	54212	54171	54171	she	148	" I do n't know how to thank you for all you are doing ; but I do love you , and will pray for you , if I may . "
54213	54220	54222	54223	Miss Benson	149	" If you may , Ruth ! "
54231	54247	54171	54171	she	148	" Yes , if I may . If you will let me pray for you . "
54248	54315	54346	54346	she	1655	" Certainly , my dear . My dear Ruth , you do n't know how often I sin ; I do so wrong , with my few temptations . We are both of us great sinners in the eyes of the Most Holy ; let us pray for each other . Do n't speak so again , my dear ; at least , not to me ! "
54363	54381	54358	54358	she	1655	" Then I may get you a black gown ? and we may call you Mrs Hilton ? "
54382	54389	54391	54391	Ruth	87	" No ; not Mrs Hilton ! "
54423	54427	54429	54429	she	1655	" Why not ? "
54431	54439	54441	54441	Ruth	87	" It was my mother 's name , "
54448	54458	54441	54441	Ruth	87	" I had better not be called by it . "
54459	54472	54474	54475	Miss Benson	149	" Then , let us call you by my mother 's name , "
54479	54520	54474	54475	Miss Benson	149	" She would have But I 'll talk to you about my mother some other time . Let me call you Mrs Denbigh . It will do very well , too . People will think you are a distant relation . "
54590	54601	54603	54604	Miss Benson	149	" with a distant relation , early left a widow , "
54997	55004	55006	55010	the kind - hearted woman	1671	" Do n't cry , miss , "
55012	55185	55006	55010	the kind - hearted woman	1671	" You 're parting from friends , maybe ? Well , that 's bad enough , but when you come to my age , you 'll think none of it . Why , I 've three sons , and they 're soldiers and sailors , all of them here , there , and everywhere . One is in America , beyond seas ; another is in China , making tea ; and another is at Gibraltar , three miles from Spain ; and yet , you see , I can laugh and eat and enjoy myself . I sometimes think I 'll try and fret a bit , just to make myself a better figure ; but , Lord ! it 's no use , it 's against my nature ; so I laugh and grow fat again . I 'd be quite thankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me feel easy in my clothes , which them manty - makers will make so tight I 'm fairly throttled . "
55306	55314	55316	55317	Miss Benson	149	" It is not much further now , "
55324	55374	55316	55317	Miss Benson	149	" See ! we are losing sight of the Welsh mountains . We have about eighteen miles of plain , and then we come to the moors and the rising ground , amidst which Eccleston lies . I wish we were there , for my brother is sadly tired . "
55458	55508	55447	55447	She	87	" Well , if you 're not tired , it would make a rest and a change for him , to be sure ; and if you were by me I could show you the first sight of Eccleston , if we reach there before it is quite dark . "
55823	55830	55871	55872	Miss Benson	149	" Be ye there , measter ? "
55831	55836	55838	55839	Miss Benson	149	" Yes , yes ! "
55843	55863	55838	55839	Miss Benson	149	" Did Sally send you , Ben ? Get the ostler 's lantern , and look out the luggage . "
56002	56007	55986	55986	their	1700	" trumpet 's lordly blare "
56051	56073	56045	56045	her	1701	" Eh , bless ye ! are ye back again ? I thought I should ha ' been lost without ye . "
56105	56110	56097	56097	she	1701	" Who 's yon ? "
56128	56145	56122	56123	Miss Benson	149	" The lady I named in my note , Sally Mrs Denbigh , a distant relation . "
56146	56163	56097	56097	she	1701	" Aye , but you said hoo was a widow . Is this chit a widow ? "
56164	56172	56174	56175	Miss Benson	149	" Yes , this is Mrs Denbigh , "
56177	56204	56097	56097	she	1701	" If I 'd been her mother , I 'd ha ' given her a lollypop instead of a husband . Hoo looks fitter for it . "
56205	56225	56231	56231	she	1702	" Hush ! Sally , Sally ! Look , there 's your master trying to move that heavy box . "
56475	56508	56464	56464	Sally	154	" My goodness gracious , Master Thurstan , when will you learn to leave off meddling with other folks ' business ! Here , Ben ! help me up with these trunks . "
56997	57000	57034	57034	Sally	154	" bedgown , "
57027	57030	57042	57042	Ruth	87	" mutch ; "
57119	57122	57127	57127	she	154	" you , "
57667	57683	57685	57685	she	154	" Is yon young woman going to stay any length o ' time with us ? "
57714	57731	57711	57711	he	149	" We can not exactly tell , Sally . She will remain until after her confinement . "
57732	57778	57711	57711	he	149	" Lord bless us and save us ! a baby in the house ! Nay , then my time 's come , and I 'll pack up and begone . I never could abide them things . I 'd sooner have rats in the house . "
57785	57790	57792	57793	Mr Benson	149	" Why , Sally ! "
57797	57815	57792	57793	Mr Benson	149	" I was not much more than a baby when you came to take care of me . "
57816	57838	57779	57779	Sally	154	" Yes , you were , Master Thurstan ; you were a fine bouncing lad of three year old and better . "
57849	57854	57779	57779	Sally	154	" fine bouncing lad , "
57892	57892	57877	57877	she	154	"
57893	57904	57906	57907	Miss Benson	149	" Well , it 's no use talking , Sally , "
57919	57949	57906	57907	Miss Benson	149	" We 've promised to keep her , and we must do it ; you 'll have none of the trouble , Sally , so do n't be afraid . "
57950	58030	57877	57877	she	154	" Well , I never ! as if I minded trouble ! You might ha ' known me better nor that . I 've scoured master 's room twice over , just to make the boards look white , though the carpet is to cover them , and now you go and cast up about me minding my trouble . If them 's the fashions you 've learnt in Wales , I 'm thankful I 've never been there . "
58055	58137	57877	57877	she	154	" Faith knows you do n't care for trouble , Sally ; she is only anxious about this poor young woman , who has no friends but ourselves . We know there will be more trouble in consequence of her coming to stay with us ; and I think , though we never spoke about it , that in making our plans we reckoned on your kind help , Sally , which has never failed us yet when we needed it . "
58138	58251	57877	57877	she	154	" You 've twice the sense of your sister , Master Thurstan , that you have . Boys always has . It 's truth there will be more trouble , and I shall have my share on't , I reckon . I can face it if I 'm told out and out , but I can not abide the way some folk has of denying there 's trouble or pain to be met ; just as if their saying there was none , would do away with it . Some folk treats one like a babby , and I do n't like it . I 'm not meaning you , Master Thurstan . "
58252	58312	58314	58315	Miss Benson	149	" No , Sally , you need not say that . I know well enough who you mean when you say ' some folk . ' However , I admit I was wrong in speaking as if you minded trouble , for there never was a creature minded it less . But I want you to like Mrs Denbigh , "
58317	58368	57877	57877	she	154	" I dare say I should , if you 'd let me alone . I did na like her sitting down in master 's chair . Set her up , indeed , in an arm - chair wi ' cushions ! Wenches in my day were glad enough of stools . "
58369	58377	58379	58380	Mr Benson	149	" She was tired to - night , "
58382	58403	58379	58380	Mr Benson	149	" We are all tired ; so if you have done your work , Sally , come in to reading . "
58421	58428	58415	58417	two of them	1766	" them that had gone astray . "
58809	58820	58806	58806	She	154	" I reckon I may bring in breakfast , now ? "
58830	58839	58841	58841	Ruth	87	" I am afraid I am very late , "
58843	58849	58851	58852	Mr Benson	149	" Oh , never mind , "
58856	58918	58851	58852	Mr Benson	149	" It was our fault for not telling you our breakfast hour . We always have prayers at half - past seven ; and , for Sally 's sake , we never vary from that time ; for she can so arrange her work , if she knows the hour of prayers , as to have her mind calm and untroubled . "
58919	58922	58924	58925	Miss Benson	149	" Ahem ! "
58930	58932	58851	58852	Mr Benson	149	" testify "
58961	58987	58955	58955	he	988	" But the breakfast does not signify being delayed a little ; and I am sure you were sadly tired with your long day yesterday . "
59005	59017	59027	59027	she	154	" It 's not my doing if it is like leather ; "
59431	59440	59442	59442	he	149	" God be merciful to me a sinner ! "
59882	59915	59917	59917	she	87	" My dear , I 've been very stupid and thoughtless . Oh ! I 'm so glad I thought of it before Mrs Bradshaw came to call . Here it is ! "
59968	59997	59957	59958	Miss Benson	149	" It was my grandmother 's ; it 's very broad ; they made them so then , to hold a posy inside : there 's one in that ;
60028	60028	60022	60022	you	87	"
60383	60571	60380	60380	Sally	154	" Missus or miss , as the case may be I 've my doubts as to you . I 'm not going to have my master and Miss Faith put upon , or shame come near them . Widows wears these sort o ' caps , and has their hair cut off ; and whether widows wears wedding - rings or not , they shall have their hair cut off they shall . I 'll have no half work in this house . I 've lived with the family forty - nine year come Michaelmas , and I 'll not see it disgraced by any one 's fine long curls . Sit down and let me snip off your hair , and let me see you sham decently in a widow 's cap to - morrow , or I 'll leave the house . Whatten 's come over Miss Faith , as used to be as mim a lady as ever was , to be taken by such as you , I dunnot know . Here ! sit down with ye , and let me crop you . "
60887	60986	60884	60884	she	792	" I thought we should ha ' had some crying I did . They 're pretty curls enough ; you 've not been so bad to let them be cut off neither . You see , Master Thurstan is no wiser than a babby in some things ; and Miss Faith just lets him have his own way ; so it 's all left to me to keep him out of scrapes . I 'll wish you a very good night . I 've heard many a one say as long hair was not wholesome . Good night . "
61002	61023	60991	60991	she	792	" You 'll put on them caps to - morrow morning . I 'll make you a present on them . "
61168	61177	61158	61158	She	87	" Sally thought I had better wear it . "
61274	61288	61266	61266	She	87	" Do you know , Thurstan , I am almost certain Sally suspects . "
61307	61314	61316	61316	he	149	" What makes you think so ? "
61318	61414	61266	61266	She	87	" Oh ! many little things . It was her odd way of ducking her head about , as if to catch a good view of Ruth 's left hand , that made me think of the wedding - ring ; and once , yesterday , when I thought I had made up quite a natural speech , and was saying how sad it was for so young a creature to be left a widow , she broke in with ' widow be farred ! ' in a very strange , contemptuous kind of manner . "
61415	61450	61266	61266	She	87	" If she suspects , we had far better tell her the truth at once . She will never rest till she finds it out , so we must make a virtue of necessity . "
61451	61508	61266	61266	She	87	" Well , brother , you shall tell her then , for I am sure I dare n't . I do n't mind doing the thing , since you talked to me that day , and since I 've got to know Ruth ; but I do mind all the clatter people will make about it . "
61509	61518	61266	61266	She	87	" But Sally is not ' people . ' "
61519	61559	61266	61266	She	87	" Oh , I see it must be done ; she 'll talk as much as all the other persons put together , so that 's the reason I call her ' people . ' Shall I call her ? "
61644	61647	61632	61632	she	154	" Well , "
61676	61831	61670	61670	she	154	" It 's just as I thought it was ; and I think you may thank me for having had the sense to put her into widow 's caps , and clip off that bonny brown hair that was fitter for a bride in lawful matrimony than for such as her . She took it very well , though . She was as quiet as a lamb , and I clipped her pretty roughly at first . I must say , though , if I 'd ha ' known who your visitor was , I 'd ha ' packed up my things and cleared myself out of the house before such as her came into it . As it 's done , I suppose I must stand by you , and help you through with it ; I only hope I sha n't lose my character , and me a parish clerk 's daughter . "
61832	61849	61851	61852	Miss Benson	149	" Oh , Sally ! people know you too well to think any ill of you , "
61887	61889	61670	61670	she	154	" clipping "
61895	61993	61670	61670	she	154	" If I 'd been with you , Master Thurstan , I 'd ha ' seen sharp after you , for you 're always picking up some one or another as nobody else would touch with a pair of tongs . Why , there was that Nelly Brandon 's child as was left at our door , if I had n't gone to th ' overseer we should have had that Irish tramp 's babby saddled on us for life ; but I went off and told th ' overseer , and th ' mother was caught . "
61994	61997	61999	62000	Mr Benson	149	" Yes , "
62004	62053	61999	62000	Mr Benson	149	" and I often lie awake and wonder what is the fate of that poor little thing , forced back on the mother who tried to get quit of it . I often doubt whether I did right ; but it 's no use thinking about it now . "
62054	62062	62064	62064	Sally	154	" I 'm thankful it is n't , "
62066	62096	62064	62064	Sally	154	" and now , if we 've talked doctrine long enough , I 'll go make th ' beds . Yon girl 's secret is safe enough for me . "
62551	62587	62528	62528	he	988	" Oh ! I thought it was better to explain it thoroughly I mean , to tell the story we wished to have believed once for all you know we agreed about that , Thurstan ? "
62590	62612	62528	62528	he	988	" Yes ; but I heard you saying you believed her husband had been a young surgeon , did I not ? "
62613	62644	62646	62646	she	87	" Well , Thurstan , you know he must have been something ; and young surgeons are so in the way of dying , it seemed very natural . Besides , "
62652	62771	62646	62646	she	87	" I do think I 've a talent for fiction , it is so pleasant to invent , and make the incidents dovetail together ; and after all , if we are to tell a lie , we may as well do it thoroughly , or else it 's of no use . A bungling lie would be worse than useless . And , Thurstan it may be very wrong but I believe I am afraid I enjoy not being fettered by truth . Do n't look so grave . You know it is necessary , if ever it was , to tell falsehoods now ; and do n't be angry with me because I do it well . "
62794	62846	62791	62791	he	1851	" If it were not for the child , I would tell all ; but the world is so cruel . You do n't know how this apparent necessity for falsehood pains me , Faith , or you would not invent all these details , which are so many additional lies . "
62847	62898	62791	62791	he	1851	" Well , well ! I will restrain myself if I have to talk about Ruth again . But Mrs Bradshaw will tell every one who need to know . You do n't wish me to contradict it , Thurstan , surely it was such a pretty , probable story . "
62899	62930	62791	62791	he	1851	" Faith ! I hope God will forgive us if we are doing wrong ; and pray , dear , do n't add one unnecessary word that is not true . "
63189	63209	63159	63159	she	154	" Quadruped , a thing wi ' four legs , Jenny ; a chair is a quadruped , child ! "

64720	64782	64783	64784	Miss Benson	149	" Oh , yes ! my wife told me yesterday about her her husband was a surgeon ; my father was a surgeon too , as I think you have heard . Very much to your credit , I must say , Mr Benson , with your limited means , to burden yourself with a poor relation . Very creditable indeed . "
64855	64869	64871	64871	she	87	" After dinner , you must go and lie down , my dear , "
64884	64964	64871	64871	she	87	" Sally goes to church again , but you wo n't mind staying alone in the house . I am sorry we have so many people to dinner , but my brother will always have enough on Sundays for any old or weak people , who may have come from a distance , to stay and dine with us ; and to - day they all seem to have come , because it is his first Sabbath at home . "
64980	64990	64992	64993	Miss Benson	149	" Here is a parcel for you , Ruth ! "
64999	65003	65005	65005	Ruth	87	" For me ! "
65030	65033	65005	65005	Ruth	87	" him , "
65048	65057	65059	65060	Miss Benson	149	" It is directed ' Mrs Denbigh , ' "
65067	65076	65085	65085	she	87	" It is in Mrs Bradshaw 's handwriting ; "
65163	65169	65171	65172	Miss Benson	149	" Very fine muslin indeed , "
65230	65240	65222	65222	she	87	" I suppose I may send it back again ? "
65241	65276	65222	65222	she	87	" My dear child ! send it back to Mr Bradshaw ! You 'd offend him for life . You may depend upon it , he means it as a mark of high favour ! "
65277	65287	65289	65289	Ruth	87	" What right had he to send it me ? "
65297	65317	65222	65222	she	87	" What right ? Mr Bradshaw thinks I do n't know exactly what you mean by ' right . ' "
65329	65392	65318	65318	Ruth	87	" There are people to whom I love to feel that I owe gratitude gratitude which I can not express , and had better not talk about but I can not see why a person whom I do not know should lay me under an obligation . Oh ! do n't say I must take this muslin , please , Miss Benson ! "
65483	65492	65494	65494	he	988	" You would rather send this present back ? "
65496	65499	65500	65500	she	87	" Yes , "
65505	65510	65500	65500	she	87	" Is it wrong ? "
65511	65520	65471	65471	Ruth	87	" Why do you want to return it ? "
65521	65537	65500	65500	she	87	" Because I feel as if Mr Bradshaw had no right to offer it me . "
65543	65549	65551	65552	Miss Benson	149	" It 's beautifully fine , "
65559	65572	65500	65500	she	87	" You think that it is a right which must be earned ? "
65573	65576	65578	65578	she	87	" Yes , "
65586	65591	65578	65578	she	87	" Do n't you ? "
65592	65713	65471	65471	Ruth	87	" I understand what you mean . It is a delight to have gifts made to you by those whom you esteem and love , because then such gifts are merely to be considered as fringes to the garment as inconsiderable additions to the mighty treasure of their affection , adding a grace , but no additional value , to what before was precious , and proceeding as naturally out of that as leaves burgeon out upon the trees ; but you feel it to be different when there is no regard for the giver to idealise the gift when it simply takes its stand among your property as so much money 's value . Is this it , Ruth ? "
65714	65750	65578	65578	she	87	" I think it is . I never reasoned why I felt as I did ; I only knew that Mr Bradshaw 's giving me a present hurt me , instead of making me glad . "
65751	65861	65471	65471	Ruth	87	" Well , but there is another side of the case we have not looked at yet we must think of that , too . You know who said , ' Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you ' ? Mr Bradshaw may not have had that in his mind when he desired his wife to send you this ; he may have been self - seeking , and only anxious to gratify his love of patronising that is the worst motive we can give him ; and that would be no excuse for your thinking only of yourself , and returning his present . "
65862	65874	65876	65876	Ruth	87	" But you would not have me pretend to be obliged ? "
65878	66121	65471	65471	Ruth	87	" No , I would not . I have often been similarly situated to you , Ruth ; Mr Bradshaw has frequently opposed me on the points on which I feel the warmest am the most earnestly convinced . He , no doubt , thinks me Quixotic , and often speaks of me , and to me , with great contempt when he is angry . I suppose he has a little fit of penitence afterwards , or perhaps he thinks he can pay for ungracious speeches by a present ; so , formerly , he invariably sent me something after these occasions . It was a time , of all others , to feel as you are doing now ; but I became convinced it would be right to accept them , giving only the very cool thanks which I felt . This omission of all show of much gratitude had the best effect the presents have much diminished ; but if the gifts have lessened , the unjustifiable speeches have decreased in still greater proportion , and I am sure we respect each other more . Take this muslin , Ruth , for the reason I named ; and thank him as your feelings prompt you . Overstrained expressions of gratitude always seem like an endeavour to place the receiver of these expressions in the position of debtor for future favours . But you wo n't fall into this error . "
66180	66189	66190	66190	she	87	" I will do what you wish me , "
66200	66208	66190	66190	she	87	" May we talk of something else ? "

68776	68900	68774	68774	she	154	" I 'll try on thee , for thou must get strength by sleeping and eating . What must I talk to thee about , I wonder . Shall I tell thee a love story or a fairy story , such as I 've telled Master Thurstan many a time and many a time , for all his father set his face again fairies , and called it vain talking ; or shall I tell you the dinner I once cooked , when Mr Harding , as was Miss Faith 's sweetheart , came unlooked for , and we 'd nought in the house but a neck of mutton , out of which I made seven dishes , all with a different name ? "
68901	68907	68909	68909	Ruth	87	" Who was Mr Harding ? "
68911	69129	68774	68774	she	154	" Oh , he was a grand gentleman from Lunnon , as had seen Miss Faith , and been struck by her pretty looks when she was out on a visit , and came here to ask her to marry him . She said , ' No , she would never leave Master Thurstan , as could never marry ; ' but she pined a deal at after he went away . She kept up afore Master Thurstan , but I seed her fretting , though I never let on that I did , for I thought she 'd soonest get over it and be thankful at after she 'd the strength to do right . However , I 've no business to be talking of Miss Benson 's concerns . I 'll tell you of my own sweethearts and welcome , or I 'll tell you of the dinner , which was the grandest thing I ever did in my life , but I thought a Lunnoner should never think country folks knew nothing ; and , my word ! I puzzled him with his dinner . I 'm doubting whether to this day he knows whether what he was eating was fish , flesh , or fowl . Shall I tell you how I managed ? "
69160	71720	69131	69131	Ruth	87	" Well , you see , I do n't know as I should call them sweethearts ; for excepting John Rawson , who was shut up in the mad - house the next week , I never had what you may call a downright offer of marriage but once . But I had once ; and so I may say I had a sweetheart . I was beginning to be afeard though , for one likes to be axed ; that 's but civility ; and I remember , after I had turned forty , and afore Jeremiah Dixon had spoken , I began to think John Rawson had perhaps not been so very mad , and that I 'd done ill to lightly his offer , as a madman 's , if it was to be the only one I was ever to have ; I do n't mean as I 'd have had him , but I thought , if it was to come o'er again , I 'd speak respectful of him to folk , and say it were only his way to go about on all fours , but that he was a sensible man in most things . However , I 'd had my laugh , and so had others , at my crazy lover , and it was late now to set him up as a Solomon . However , I thought it would be no bad thing to be tried again ; but I little thought the trial would come when it did . You see , Saturday night is a leisure night in counting - houses and such - like places , while it 's the busiest of all for servants . Well ! it was a Saturday night , and I 'd my baize apron on , and the tails of my bed - gown pinned together behind , down on my knees , pipeclaying the kitchen , when a knock comes to the back door . ' Come in ! ' says I ; but it knocked again , as if it were too stately to open the door for itself ; so I got up , rather cross , and opened the door ; and there stood Jerry Dixon , Mr Holt 's head clerk ; only he was not head clerk then . So I stood , stopping up the door , fancying he wanted to speak to master ; but he kind of pushed past me , and telling me summut about the weather as if I could not see it for myself , he took a chair , and sat down by the oven . ' Cool and easy ! ' thought I ; meaning hisself , not his place , which I knew must be pretty hot . Well ! it seemed no use standing waiting for my gentleman to go ; not that he had much to say either ; but he kept twirling his hat round and round , and smoothing the nap on't with the back of his hand . So at last I squatted down to my work , and thinks I , I shall be on my knees all ready if he puts up a prayer , for I knew he was a Methodee by bringing - up , and had only lately turned to master 's way of thinking ; and them Methodees are terrible hands at unexpected prayers when one least looks for 'em . I ca n't say I like their way of taking one by surprise , as it were ; but then I 'm a parish clerk 's daughter , and could never demean myself to dissenting fashions , always save and except Master Thurstan 's , bless him . However , I 'd been caught once or twice unawares , so this time I thought I 'd be up to it , and I moved a dry duster wherever I went , to kneel upon in case he began when I were in a wet place . By - and - by I thought , if the man would pray it would be a blessing , for it would prevent his sending his eyes after me wherever I went ; for when they takes to praying they shuts their eyes , and quivers th ' lids in a queer kind o ' way them Dissenters does . I can speak pretty plain to you , for you 're bred in the Church like mysel ' , and must find it as out o ' the way as I do to be among dissenting folk . God forbid I should speak disrespectful of Master Thurstan and Miss Faith , though ; I never think on them as Church or Dissenters , but just as Christians . But to come back to Jerry . First , I tried always to be cleaning at his back ; but when he wheeled round , so as always to face me , I thought I 'd try a different game . So , says I , ' Master Dixon , I ax your pardon , but I must pipeclay under your chair . Will you please to move ? ' Well , he moved ; and by - and - by I was at him again with the same words ; and at after that , again and again , till he were always moving about wi ' his chair behind him , like a snail as carries its house on its back . And the great gaupus never seed that I were pipeclaying the same places twice over . At last I got desperate cross , he were so in my way ; so I made two big crosses on the tails of his brown coat ; for you see , whenever he went , up or down , he drew out the tails of his coat from under him , and stuck them through the bars of the chair ; and flesh and blood could not resist pipeclaying them for him ; and a pretty brushing he 'd have , I reckon , to get it off again . Well ! at length he clears his throat uncommon loud ; so I spreads my duster , and shuts my eyes all ready ; but when nought comed of it , I opened my eyes a little bit to see what he were about . My word ! if there he was n't down on his knees right facing me , staring as hard as he could . Well ! I thought it would be hard work to stand that , if he made a long ado ; so I shut my eyes again , and tried to think serious , as became what I fancied were coming ; but , forgive me ! but I thought why could n't the fellow go in and pray wi ' Master Thurstan , as had always a calm spirit ready for prayer , instead o ' me , who had my dresser to scour , let alone an apron to iron . At last he says , says he , ' Sally ! will you oblige me with your hand ? ' So I thought it were , maybe , Methodee fashion to pray hand in hand ; and I 'll not deny but I wished I 'd washed it better after black - leading the kitchen fire . I thought I 'd better tell him it were not so clean as I could wish , so says I , ' Master Dixon , you shall have it , and welcome , if I may just go and wash 'em first . ' But , says he , ' My dear Sally , dirty or clean it 's all the same to me , seeing I 'm only speaking in a figuring way . What I 'm asking on my bended knees is , that you 'd please to be so kind as to be my wedded wife ; week after next will suit me , if it 's agreeable to you ! ' My word ! I were up on my feet in an instant ! It were odd now , were n't it ? I never thought of taking the fellow , and getting married ; for all , I 'll not deny , I had been thinking it would be agreeable to be axed . But all at once , I could n't abide the chap . ' Sir , ' says I , trying to look shame - faced as became the occasion , but for all that , feeling a twittering round my mouth that I were afeard might end in a laugh ' Master Dixon , I 'm obleeged to you for the compliment , and thank ye all the same , but I think I 'd prefer a single life . ' He looked mighty taken aback ; but in a minute he cleared up , and was as sweet as ever . He still kept on his knees , and I wished he 'd take himself up ; but , I reckon , he thought it would give force to his words ; says he , ' Think again , my dear Sally . I 've a four - roomed house , and furniture conformable ; and eighty pound a year . You may never have such a chance again . ' There were truth enough in that , but it was not pretty in the man to say it ; and it put me up a bit . ' As for that , neither you nor I can tell , Master Dixon . You 're not the first chap as I 've had down on his knees afore me , axing me to marry him you see I were thinking of John Rawson , only I thought there were no need to say he were on all fours it were truth he were on his knees , you know , and maybe you 'll not be the last . Anyhow , I 've no wish to change my condition just now . ' ' I 'll wait till Christmas , ' says he . ' I 've a pig as will be ready for killing then , so I must get married before that . ' Well now ! would you believe it ? the pig were a temptation . I 'd a receipt for curing hams , as Miss Faith would never let me try , saying the old way were good enough . However , I resisted . Says I , very stern , because I felt I 'd been wavering , ' Master Dixon , once for all , pig or no pig , I 'll not marry you . And if you 'll take my advice , you 'll get up off your knees . The flags is but damp yet , and it would be an awkward thing to have rheumatiz just before winter . ' With that he got up , stiff enough . He looked as sulky a chap as ever I clapped eyes on . And as he were so black and cross , I thought I 'd done well whatever came of the pig to say ' No ' to him . ' You may live to repent this , ' says he , very red . ' But I 'll not be too hard upon ye , I 'll give you another chance . I 'll let you have the night to think about it , and I 'll just call in to hear your second thoughts , after chapel to - morrow . ' Well now ! did ever you hear the like ? But that is the way with all of them men , thinking so much of theirselves , and that it 's but ask and have . They 've never had me , though ; and I shall be sixty - one next Martinmas , so there 's not much time left for them to try me , I reckon . Well ! when Jeremiah said that , he put me up more than ever , and I says , ' My first thoughts , second thoughts , and third thoughts is all one and the same ; you 've but tempted me once , and that was when you spoke of your pig . But of yoursel ' you 're nothing to boast on , and so I 'll bid you good night , and I 'll keep my manners , or else , if I told the truth , I should say it had been a great loss of time listening to you . But I 'll be civil so good night . ' He never said a word , but went off as black as thunder , slamming the door after him . The master called me in to prayers , but I ca n't say I could put my mind to them , for my heart was beating so . However , it was a comfort to have had an offer of holy matrimony ; and though it flustered me , it made me think more of myself . In the night , I began to wonder if I 'd not been cruel and hard to him . You see , I were feverish - like ; and the old song of Barbary Allen would keep running in my head , and I thought I were Barbary , and he were young Jemmy Gray , and that maybe he 'd die for love of me ; and I pictured him to mysel ' , lying on his death - bed , with his face turned to the wall , ' wi ' deadly sorrow sighing , ' and I could ha ' pinched mysel ' for having been so like cruel Barbary Allen . And when I got up next day , I found it hard to think on the real Jerry Dixon I had seen the night before , apart from the sad and sorrowful Jerry I thought on a - dying , when I were between sleeping and waking . And for many a day I turned sick , when I heard the passing bell , for I thought it were the bell loud - knelling which were to break my heart wi ' a sense of what I 'd missed in saying ' No ' to Jerry , and so killing him with cruelty . But in less than a three week , I heard parish bells a - ringing merrily for a wedding ; and in the course of a morning , some one says to me , ' Hark ! how the bells is ringing for Jerry Dixon 's wedding ! ' And , all on a sudden , he changed back again from a heart - broken young fellow , like Jemmy Gray , into a stout , middle - aged man , ruddy - complexioned , with a wart on his left cheek like life !

71760	71780	71782	71782	Sally	154	" I thought I 'd lost some of my gifts if I could not talk a body to sleep , "
71932	71955	71957	71957	she	87	" Do you know of any cottage where the people are clean , and where they would not mind taking me in ? "
71959	71969	71971	71972	Miss Benson	149	" Taking you in ! What do you mean ? "
71986	71990	71992	71992	Ruth	87	" I mean , "
71994	72021	71992	71992	Ruth	87	" where I might lodge with my baby any very poor place would do , only it must be clean , or he might be ill . "
72022	72040	72042	72043	Miss Benson	149	" And what in the world do you want to go and lodge in a cottage for ? "
72070	72105	72056	72056	she	87	" I think I could make dresses . I know I did not learn as much as I might , but perhaps I might do for servants , and people who are not particular . "
72106	72115	72117	72118	Miss Benson	149	" Servants are as particular as any one , "
72132	72143	72145	72145	Ruth	87	" Well ! somebody who would be patient with me , "
72147	72158	72161	72162	Miss Benson	149	" Nobody is patient over an ill - fitting gown , "
72164	72175	72161	72162	Miss Benson	149	" There 's the stuff spoilt , and what not ! "
72176	72186	72188	72188	Ruth	87	" Perhaps I could find plain work to do , "
72193	72241	72188	72188	Ruth	87	" That I can do very well ; mamma taught me , and I liked to learn from her . If you would be so good , Miss Benson , you might tell people I could do plain work very neatly , and punctually , and cheaply . "
72242	72252	72254	72255	Miss Benson	149	" You 'd get sixpence a day , perhaps , "
72257	72304	72254	72255	Miss Benson	149	" and who would take care of baby , I should like to know ? Prettily he 'd be neglected , would not he ? Why , he 'd have the croup and the typhus fever in no time , and be burnt to ashes after . "
72305	72321	72327	72327	he	2029	" I have thought of all . Look how he sleeps ! Hush , darling ; "
72368	72394	72351	72351	Ruth	87	" Yes , just now I know he will not sleep ; but very often he will , and in the night he always does . "
72395	72427	72428	72429	Mr Benson	149	" And so you 'd work in the night and kill yourself , and leave your poor baby an orphan . Ruth ! I 'm ashamed of you . Now , brother "
72435	72479	72428	72429	Mr Benson	149	" is not this too bad of Ruth ; here she is planning to go away and leave us , just as we as I , at least , have grown so fond of baby , and he 's beginning to know me . "
72480	72491	72493	72494	Mr Benson	149	" Where were you thinking of going to , Ruth ? "
72500	72554	72428	72429	Mr Benson	149	" Anywhere to be near you and Miss Benson ; in any poor cottage where I might lodge very cheaply , and earn my livelihood by taking in plain sewing , and perhaps a little dressmaking ; and where I could come and see you and dear Miss Benson sometimes and bring baby . "
72555	72589	72591	72592	Miss Benson	149	" If he was not dead before then of some fever , or burn , or scald , poor neglected child ; or you had not worked yourself to death with never sleeping , "
72609	72662	72604	72604	he	149	" Whatever you may do when this little fellow is a year old , and able to dispense with some of a mother 's care , let me beg you , Ruth , as a favour to me as a still greater favour to my sister , is it not , Faith ? "
72663	72675	72604	72604	he	149	" Yes ; you may put it so if you like . "
72676	72682	72684	72684	he	149	" To stay with us , "
72686	72780	72684	72684	he	149	" till then . When baby is twelve months old , we 'll talk about it again , and very likely before then some opening may be shown us . Never fear leading an idle life , Ruth . We 'll treat you as a daughter , and set you all the household tasks ; and it is not for your sake that we ask you to stay , but for this little dumb helpless child 's ; and it is not for our sake that you must stay , but for his . "
72785	72793	72795	72795	she	87	" I do not deserve your kindness , "
72802	72809	72795	72795	she	87	" I do not deserve it . "
73058	73064	73066	73066	Sally	154	" Where 's Miss Benson ? "
73070	73077	73079	73079	Ruth	87	" Gone out with Mr Benson , "
73191	73260	73262	73262	she	87	" My bonny boy ! are they letting the salt tears drop on thy sweet face before thou'rt weaned ! Little somebody knows how to be a mother I could make a better myself . ' Dance , thumbkin , dance dance , ye merry men every one . ' Aye , that 's it ! smile , my pretty . Any one but a child like thee , "
73268	73330	73262	73262	she	87	" would have known better than to bring ill - luck on thy babby by letting tears fall on its face before it was weaned . But thou'rt not fit to have a babby , and so I 've said many a time . I 've a great mind to buy thee a doll , and take thy babby mysel ' . "
73417	73462	73464	73465	the servant	701	" Give him back to me , please . I did not know it brought ill - luck , or if my heart broke I would not have let a tear drop on his face I never will again . Thank you , Sally , "
73520	73529	73531	73531	Sally	154	" Thou'lt be a mother , after all , "
73548	73618	73542	73542	Ruth	87	" But why talk of thy heart breaking ? I do n't question thee about what 's past and gone ; but now thou'rt wanting for nothing , nor thy child either ; the time to come is the Lord 's , and in His hands ; and yet thou goest about a - sighing and a - moaning in a way that I ca n't stand or thole . "
73619	73626	73628	73628	Ruth	87	" What do I do wrong ? "
73630	73639	73628	73628	Ruth	87	" I try to do all I can . "
73640	73647	73649	73649	Sally	154	" Yes , in a way , "
73660	74269	73649	73649	Sally	154	" Thou dost it but there 's a right and a wrong way of setting about everything and to my thinking , the right way is to take a thing up heartily , if it is only making a bed . Why ! dear ah me , making a bed may be done after a Christian fashion , I take it , or else what 's to come of such as me in heaven , who 've had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers ? When I was a girl , and wretched enough about Master Thurstan , and the crook on his back which came of the fall I gave him , I took to praying and sighing , and giving up the world ; and I thought it were wicked to care for the flesh , so I made heavy puddings , and was careless about dinner and the rooms , and thought I was doing my duty , though I did call myself a miserable sinner . But one night , the old missus Master Thurstan 's mother came in , and sat down by me , as I was a - scolding myself , without thinking of what I was saying ; and , says she , ' Sally ! what are you blaming yourself about , and groaning over ? We hear you in the parlour every night , and it makes my heart ache . ' ' Oh , ma'am , ' says I , ' I 'm a miserable sinner , and I 'm travailing in the new birth . ' ' Was that the reason , ' says she , ' why the pudding was so heavy to - day ? ' ' Oh , ma'am , ma'am , ' said I , ' if you would not think of the things of the flesh , but trouble yourself about your immortal soul . ' And I sat a - shaking my head to think about her soul . ' But , ' says she , in her sweet - dropping voice , ' I do try to think of my soul every hour of the day , if by that you mean trying to do the will of God , but we 'll talk now about the pudding ; Master Thurstan could not eat it , and I know you 'll be sorry for that . ' Well ! I was sorry , but I did n't choose to say so , as she seemed to expect me ; so says I , ' It 's a pity to see children brought up to care for things of the flesh ; ' and then I could have bitten my tongue out , for the missus looked so grave , and I thought of my darling little lad pining for want of his food . At last , says she , ' Sally , do you think God has put us into the world just to be selfish , and do nothing but see after our own souls ? or to help one another with heart and hand , as Christ did to all who wanted help ? ' I was silent , for , you see , she puzzled me . So she went on , ' What is that beautiful answer in your Church catechism , Sally ? ' I were pleased to hear a Dissenter , as I did not think would have done it , speak so knowledgeably about the catechism , and she went on : ' "
74289	74778	73649	73649	Sally	154	" well , your station is a servant , and it is as honourable as a king 's , if you look at it right ; you are to help and serve others in one way , just as a king is to help others in another . Now what way are you to help and serve , or to do your duty , in that station of life unto which it has pleased God to call you ? Did it answer God 's purpose , and serve Him , when the food was unfit for a child to eat , and unwholesome for any one ? ' Well ! I would not give it up , I was so pig - headed about my soul ; so says I , ' I wish folks would be content with locusts and wild honey , and leave other folks in peace to work out their salvation ; ' and I groaned out pretty loud to think of missus 's soul . I often think since she smiled a bit at me ; but she said , ' Well , Sally , to - morrow , you shall have time to work out your salvation ; but as we have no locusts in England , and I do n't think they 'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had , I will come and make the pudding ; but I shall try and do it well , not only for him to like it , but because everything may be done in a right way or a wrong ; the right way is to do it as well as we can , as in God 's sight ; the wrong is to do it in a self - seeking spirit , which either leads us to neglect it to follow out some device of our own for our own ends , or to give up too much time and thought to it both before and after the doing . ' Well ! I thought of all old missus 's words this morning , when I saw you making the beds . You sighed so , you could not half shake the pillows ; your heart was not in your work ; and yet it was the duty God had set you , I reckon ; I know it 's not the work parsons preach about ; though I do n't think they go so far off the mark when they read , ' whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , that do with all thy might . ' Just try for a day to think of all the odd jobs as has to be done well and truly as in God 's sight , not just slurred over anyhow , and you 'll go through them twice as cheerfully , and have no thought to spare for sighing or crying . "
75537	75541	75513	75513	herself	154	" them Dissenters ; "
75834	75915	75787	75787	she	154	" Oh , Miss Benson ! I never saw a christening ; papa says I may go , if you think Mr Benson and Mrs Denbigh would not dislike it ; and I will be quite quiet , and sit up behind the door , or anywhere ; and that sweet little baby ! I should so like to see him christened ; is he to be called Leonard , did you say ? After Mr Denbigh , is it ? "
75916	75921	75923	75924	Miss Benson	149	" No not exactly , "
75929	75972	75787	75787	she	154	" Was not Mr Denbigh 's name Leonard , then ? Mamma thought it would be sure to be called after him , and so did I. But I may come to the christening , may I not , dear Miss Benson ? "
76374	76379	76372	76372	he	149	" Let us pray , "
76571	76577	76579	76579	he	149	" Come home with us , "
76581	76600	76579	76579	he	149	" and stay to tea . You have never drank tea with us since you went to school . "
76601	76607	76609	76610	Miss Bradshaw	173	" I wish I might , "
76616	76630	76609	76610	Miss Bradshaw	173	" But I must ask papa . May I run home and ask ? "
76631	76639	76646	76646	her	173	" To be sure , my dear ! "
76671	76727	76653	76654	her mother	719	" Take no sugar in your tea , Jemima . I am sure the Bensons ought not to be able to afford sugar , with their means . And do not eat much ; you can have plenty at home on your return ; remember Mrs Denbigh 's keep must cost them a great deal . "
76802	76817	76819	76820	Miss Benson	149	" What made ye leave the chapel - vestry before my brother had ended ? "
76822	76852	76853	76854	Miss Benson	149	" Indeed , ma'am , I thought master had prayed so long he 'd be drouthy . So I just slipped out to put on the kettle for tea . "
76994	77015	77016	77016	Sally	154	" Well , I marvel how , with Benson 's salary , he can afford to keep such a table . "
77212	77221	77223	77224	Miss Bradshaw	173	" A christening is a very solemn service , "
77226	77260	77223	77224	Miss Bradshaw	173	" I had no idea it was so solemn . Mr Benson seemed to speak as if he had a weight of care on his heart that God alone could relieve or lighten . "
77261	77270	77272	77273	Miss Benson	149	" My brother feels these things very much , "
77310	77320	77322	77322	Jemima	173	" I could not quite follow him all through , "
77324	77394	77322	77322	Jemima	173	" what did he mean by saying , ' This child , rebuked by the world and bidden to stand apart , Thou wilt not rebuke , but wilt suffer it to come to Thee and be blessed with Thine almighty blessing ' ? Why is this little darling to be rebuked ? I do not think I remember the exact words , but he said something like that . "
77395	77419	77448	77448	she	173	" My dear ! your gown is dripping wet ! it must have dipped into the tub ; let me wring it out . "
77420	77431	77433	77433	Jemima	173	" Oh , thank you ! Never mind my gown ! "
77752	77761	77763	77764	Miss Benson	149	" She 's a warm - hearted girl , "
77766	77911	77763	77764	Miss Benson	149	" She remembers all the old days before she went to school . She is worth two of Mr Richard . They 're each of them just the same as they were when they were children , when they broke that window in the chapel , and he ran away home , and she came knocking at our door , with a single knock , just like a beggar 's , and I went to see who it was , and was quite startled to see her round , brown , honest face looking up at me , half - frightened , and telling me what she had done , and offering me the money in her savings bank to pay for it . We never should have heard of Master Richard 's share in the business if it had not been for Sally . "
77912	77916	77918	77919	Mr Benson	149	" But remember , "
77921	77947	77918	77919	Mr Benson	149	" how strict Mr Bradshaw has always been with his children . It is no wonder if poor Richard was a coward in those days . "
77948	77959	77961	77962	Miss Benson	149	" He is now , or I 'm much mistaken , "
77964	78046	77961	77962	Miss Benson	149	" And Mr Bradshaw was just as strict with Jemima , and she 's no coward . But I 've no faith in Richard . He has a look about him that I do n't like . And when Mr Bradshaw was away on business in Holland last year , for those months my young gentleman did not come half as regularly to chapel , and I always believe that story of his being seen out with the hounds at Smithiles . "
78047	78062	78064	78065	Mr Benson	149	" Those are neither of them great offences in a young man of twenty , "
78069	78105	77918	77919	Mr Benson	149	" No ! I do n't mind them in themselves ; but when he could change back so easily to being regular and mim when his father came home , I do n't like that . "
78106	78115	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" Leonard shall never be afraid of me , "
78126	78162	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" I will be his friend from the very first ; and I will try and learn how to be a wise friend , and you will teach me , wo n't you , sir ? "
78163	78175	78177	78178	Miss Benson	149	" What made you wish to call him Leonard , Ruth ? "
78180	78211	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" It was my mother 's father 's name ; and she used to tell me about him and his goodness , and I thought if Leonard could be like him "
78212	78298	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" Do you remember the discussion there was about Miss Bradshaw 's name , Thurstan ? Her father wanting her to be called Hepzibah , but insisting that she was to have a Scripture name at any rate ; and Mrs Bradshaw wanting her to be Juliana , after some novel she had read not long before ; and at last Jemima was fixed upon , because it would do either for a Scripture name or a name for a heroine out of a book . "
78299	78310	78312	78312	Ruth	87	" I did not know Jemima was a Scripture name , "
78314	78388	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" Oh yes , it is . One of Job 's daughters ; Jemima , Kezia , and Keren - Happuch . There are a good many Jemimas in the world , and some Kezias , but I never heard of a Keren - Happuch ; and yet we know just as much of one as of another . People really like a pretty name , whether in Scripture or out of it . "
78389	78400	78402	78403	Mr Benson	149	" When there is no particular association with the name , "
78405	78501	78117	78117	Ruth	87	" Now , I was called Faith after the cardinal virtue ; and I like my name , though many people would think it too Puritan ; that was according to our gentle mother 's pious desire . And Thurstan was called by his name because my father wished it ; for , although he was what people called a radical and a democrat in his ways of talking and thinking , he was very proud in his heart of being descended from some old Sir Thurstan , who figured away in the French wars . "
78502	78514	78517	78518	Mr Benson	149	" The difference between theory and practice , thinking and being , "
78691	78696	78698	78699	Miss Benson	149	" God bless him ! "
78725	78753	78698	78699	Miss Benson	149	" Now , do n't get up too early , Ruth ! Injuring your health will be short - sighted wisdom and poor economy . Good night ! "
78754	78767	78769	78769	Ruth	87	" Good night , dear Miss Benson . Good night , Sally . "
78794	78822	78775	78775	she	87	" God bless thee , darling ! I only ask to be one of His instruments , and not thrown aside as useless or worse than useless . "
79160	79177	79147	79147	she	87	" Please , I really would rather not be told if people do think me pretty . "
79178	79199	79201	79201	Jemima	173	" But it was not merely beautiful ; it was sweet - looking and good , Mrs Postlethwaite called you , "
79203	79246	79147	79147	she	87	" All the more I would rather not hear it . I may be pretty , but I know I am not good . Besides , I do n't think we ought to hear what is said of us behind our backs . "
79260	79280	79247	79247	Ruth	87	" Dear Mrs Denbigh , I never will admire or praise you again . Only let me love you . "
79281	79288	79290	79290	Ruth	87	" And let me love you ! "
80095	80112	80090	80092	the old servant	792	" Well , and who was there ? and what did they give you for supper ? "
80113	80138	80140	80141	Miss Benson	149	" Only Mr Farquhar besides ourselves ; and sandwiches , sponge - cake , and wine ; there was no occasion for anything more , "
80152	80167	80090	80092	the old servant	792	" Mr Farquhar ! Why they do say he 's thinking of Miss Jemima ! "
80168	80183	80185	80186	Miss Benson	149	" Nonsense , Sally ! why he 's old enough to be her father ! "
80195	80215	80217	80217	Sally	154	" There 's no need for it to be called nonsense , though he may be ten year older , "
80224	80243	80217	80217	Sally	154	" Bradshaw 's Betsy knows what she 's about , and would n't have said it for nothing . "
80886	80892	80893	80893	they	2217	" Life let us cherish ; "
81029	81038	81040	81040	she	154	" Whatten you call this in your country ? "
81042	81047	81049	81049	Ruth	87	" Old - man , "
81051	81189	81049	81049	Ruth	87	" We call it here lad's - love . It and peppermint - drops always remind me of going to church in the country . Here ! I 'll get you a black - currant leaf to put in the teapot . It gives it a flavour . We had bees once against this wall ; but when missus died , we forgot to tell 'em , and put 'em in mourning , and , in course , they swarmed away without our knowing , and the next winter came a hard frost , and they died . Now , I dare say , the water will be boiling ; and it 's time for little master there to come in , for the dew is falling . See , all the daisies is shutting themselves up . "
81279	81291	81293	81293	she	154	" Aye ! things was different when I was a girl , "
81295	81399	81293	81293	she	154	" Eggs was thirty for a shilling , and butter only sixpence a pound . My wage when I came here was but three pound , and I did on it , and was always clean and tidy , which is more than many a lass can say now who gets her seven and eight pound a year ; and tea was kept for an afternoon drink , and pudding was eaten afore meat in them days , and the upshot was , people paid their debts better ; aye , aye ! we'n gone backwards , and we thinken we'n gone forrards . "
81433	81815	81817	81817	she	2227	" You 'll not go for to think now that I 've not more than three pound a year . I 've a deal above that now . First of all , old missus gave me four pound , for she said I were worth it , and I thought in my heart that I were ; so I took it without more ado ; but after her death , Master Thurstan and Miss Faith took a fit of spending , and says they to me , one day as I carried tea in , ' Sally , we think your wages ought to be raised . ' ' What matter what you think ! ' said I , pretty sharp , for I thought they 'd ha ' shown more respect to missus if they 'd let things stand as they were in her time ; and they 'd gone and moved the sofa away from the wall to where it stands now , already that very day . So I speaks up sharp , and , says I , ' As long as I 'm content , I think it 's no business of yours to be meddling wi ' me and my money matters . ' ' But , ' says Miss Faith she 's always the one to speak first if you 'll notice , though it 's master that comes in and clinches the matter with some reason she 'd never ha ' thought of he were always a sensible lad , ' Sally , all the servants in the town have six pound and better , and you have as hard a place as any of 'em . ' ' Did you ever hear me grumble about my work that you talk about it in that way ? wait till I grumble , ' says I , ' but do n't meddle wi ' me till then . ' So I flung off in a huff ; but in the course of the evening , Master Thurstan came in and sat down in the kitchen , and he 's such winning ways he wiles one over to anything ; and besides , a notion had come into my head now , you 'll not tell , "
81844	81948	81950	81950	Sally	154	" I thought I should like to be an heiress wi ' money , and leave it all to Master and Miss Faith ; and I thought if I 'd six pound a year I could , maybe , get to be an heiress ; all I was feared on was that some chap or other might marry me for my money , but I 've managed to keep the fellows off ; so I looks mim and grateful , and I thanks Master Thurstan for his offer , and I takes the wages ; and what do you think I 've done ? "
81957	81963	81965	81965	Ruth	87	" What have you done ? "
81967	81970	81972	81972	Sally	154	" Why , "
81978	82008	82010	82010	she	154	" I 've saved thirty pound ! but that 's not it . I 've getten a lawyer to make me a will ; that 's it , wench ! "
82018	82025	82027	82027	Ruth	87	" How did you manage it ? "
82029	82036	82038	82038	Sally	154	" Aye , that was it , "
82040	82164	82038	82038	Sally	154	" I thowt about it many a night before I hit on the right way . I was afeard the money might be thrown into Chancery , if I did n't make it all safe , and yet I could na ' ask Master Thurstan . At last and at length , John Jackson , the grocer , had a nephew come to stay a week with him , as was ' prentice to a lawyer in Liverpool ; so now was my time , and here was my lawyer . Wait a minute ! I could tell you my story better if I had my will in my hand ; and I 'll scomfish you if ever you go for to tell . "
82222	82232	82234	82234	she	2229	" Now , do you know what this is ? "
82240	82764	82766	82766	she	2231	" It 's parchment , and it 's the right stuff to make wills on . People gets into Chancery if they do n't make them o ' this stuff , and I reckon Tom Jackson thowt he 'd have a fresh job on it if he could get it into Chancery ; for the rascal went and wrote it on a piece of paper at first , and came and read it me out loud off a piece of paper no better than what one writes letters upon . I were up to him ; and , thinks I , Come , come , my lad , I 'm not a fool , though you may think so ; I know a paper will wo n't stand , but I 'll let you run your rig . So I sits and I listens . And would you belie ' me , he read it out as if it were as clear a business as your giving me that thimble no more ado , though it were thirty pound ! I could understand it mysel ' that were no law for me . I wanted summat to consider about , and for th ' meaning to be wrapped up as I wrap up my best gown . So says I , ' Tom ! it 's not on parchment . I mun have it on parchment . ' ' This ' ill do as well , ' says he . ' We 'll get it witnessed , and it will stand good . ' Well ! I liked the notion of having it witnessed , and for a while that soothed me ; but after a bit , I felt I should like it done according to law , and not plain out as anybody might ha ' done it ; I mysel ' , if I could have written . So says I , ' Tom ! I mun have it on parchment . ' ' Parchment costs money , ' says he , very grave . ' Oh , oh , my lad ! are ye there ? ' thinks I. ' That 's the reason I 'm clipped of law . ' So says I , ' Tom ! I mun have it on parchment . I 'll pay the money and welcome . It 's thirty pound , and what I can lay to it . I 'll make it safe . It shall be on parchment , and I 'll tell thee what , lad ! I 'll gie ye sixpence for every good law - word you put in it , sounding like , and not to be caught up as a person runs . Your master had need to be ashamed of you as a ' prentice if you ca n't do a thing more tradesman - like than this ! ' Well ! he laughed above a bit , but I were firm , and stood to it . So he made it out on parchment . Now , woman , try and read it ! "
82793	82796	82788	82788	Ruth	87	" testatrix , "
82801	82808	82810	82810	she	87	" That was the first sixpence , "
82812	82854	82810	82810	she	87	" I thowt he was going to fob me off again wi ' plain language ; but when that word came , I out wi ' my sixpence , and gave it to him on the spot . Now go on . "
82859	82862	82856	82856	Ruth	87	" accruing . "
82863	82962	82856	82856	Ruth	87	" That was the second sixpence . Four sixpences it were in all , besides six - and - eightpence as we bargained at first , and three - and - fourpence parchment . There ! that 's what I call a will ; witnessed according to law , and all . Master Thurstan will be prettily taken in when I die , and he finds all his extra wage left back to him . But it will teach him it 's not so easy as he thinks for , to make a woman give up her way . "
83322	83375	83315	83315	She	4724	" Do n't hurry yourself , Thurstan ! all 's well ; only I wanted to tell you something . Do n't fidget yourself baby is quite well , bless him ! It 's only good news . Come into your room , and let me talk a little quietly with you . "
83421	83796	83392	83392	she	4724	" Well , now ! to think how often things fall out just as we want them , Thurstan ! Have not you often wondered what was to be done with Ruth when the time came at which we promised her she should earn her living ? I am sure you have , because I have so often thought about it myself . And yet I never dared to speak out my fear , because that seemed giving it a shape . And now Mr Bradshaw has put all to rights . He invited Mr Jackson to dinner yesterday , just as we were going into chapel ; and then he turned to me and asked me if I would come to tea straight from afternoon chapel , because Mrs Bradshaw wanted to speak to me . He made it very clear I was not to bring Ruth ; and , indeed , she was only too happy to stay at home with baby . And so I went ; and Mrs Bradshaw took me into her bedroom , and shut the doors , and said Mr Bradshaw had told her , that he did not like Jemima being so much confined with the younger ones while they were at their lessons , and that he wanted some one above a nursemaid to sit with them while their masters were there some one who would see about their learning their lessons , and who would walk out with them ; a sort of nursery governess , I think she meant , though she did not say so ; and Mr Bradshaw for , of course , I saw his thoughts and words constantly peeping out , though he had told her to speak to me believed that our Ruth would be the very person . Now , Thurstan , do n't look so surprised , as if she had never come into your head ! I am sure I saw what Mrs Bradshaw was driving at , long before she came to the point ; and I could scarcely keep from smiling , and saying , ' We 'd jump at the proposal ' long before I ought to have known anything about it . "
83797	83808	83810	83811	Mr Benson	149	" Oh , I wonder what we ought to do ! "
83813	83834	83810	83811	Mr Benson	149	" Or rather , I believe I see what we ought to do , if I durst but do it . "
83835	83844	83846	83847	his sister	4724	" Why , what ought we to do ? "
83852	83864	83392	83392	she	4724	" I ought to go and tell Mr Bradshaw the whole story "
83865	83875	83877	83878	Miss Benson	149	" And get Ruth turned out of our house , "
83882	83891	83893	83894	her brother	988	" They ca n't make us do that , "
83896	83905	83893	83894	her brother	988	" I do not think they would try . "
83906	83956	83392	83392	she	4724	" Yes , Mr Bradshaw would try ; and he would blazon out poor Ruth 's sin , and there would not be a chance for her left . I know him well , Thurstan ; and why should he be told now , more than a year ago ? "
83957	83977	83893	83894	her brother	988	" A year ago he did not want to put her in a situation of trust about his children . "
83978	84051	83392	83392	she	4724	" And you think she 'll abuse that trust , do you ? You 've lived a twelvemonth in the house with Ruth , and the end of it is , you think she will do his children harm ! Besides , who encouraged Jemima to come to the house so much to see Ruth ? Did you not say it would do them both good to see something of each other ? "
84057	84289	84290	84290	She	2247	" If you had not known Ruth as well as you do if during her stay with us you had marked anything wrong , or forward , or deceitful , or immodest , I would say at once , ' Do n't allow Mr Bradshaw to take her into his house ; ' but still I would say , ' Do n't tell of her sin and her sorrow to so severe a man so unpitiful a judge . ' But here I ask you , Thurstan , can you , or I , or Sally quick - eyed as she is , say , that in any one thing we have had true , just occasion to find fault with Ruth ? I do n't mean that she is perfect she acts without thinking , her temper is sometimes warm and hasty ; but have we any right to go and injure her prospects for life , by telling Mr Bradshaw all we know of her errors only sixteen when she did so wrong , and never to escape from it all her many years to come to have the despair which would arise from its being known , clutching her back into worse sin ? What harm do you think she can do ? What is the risk to which you think you are exposing Mr Bradshaw 's children ? "
84319	84330	84332	84332	he	2248	" I do not see any danger that can arise , "
84347	84388	84332	84332	he	2248	" I have watched Ruth , and I believe she is pure and truthful ; and the very sorrow and penitence she has felt the very suffering she has gone through has given her a thoughtful conscientiousness beyond her age . "
84389	84398	84400	84401	Miss Benson	149	" That and the care of her baby , "
84414	84436	84438	84438	Thurstan	167	" Ah , Faith ! that baby you so much dreaded once , is turning out a blessing , you see , "
84447	84475	84332	84332	he	2248	" Yes ! any one might be thankful , and better too , for Leonard ; but how could I tell that it would be like him ? "
84476	84491	84332	84332	he	2248	" But to return to Ruth and Mr Bradshaw . What did you say ? "
84492	84561	84332	84332	he	2248	" Oh ! with my feelings , of course , I was only too glad to accept the proposal , and so I told Mrs Bradshaw then ; and I afterwards repeated it to Mr Bradshaw , when he asked me if his wife had mentioned their plans . They would understand that I must consult you and Ruth , before it could be considered as finally settled . "
84562	84571	84332	84332	he	2248	" And have you named it to her ? "
84572	84575	84577	84578	Miss Benson	149	" Yes , "
84592	84599	84601	84601	he	2250	" And what did she say ? "
84611	84929	84332	84332	he	2248	" At first she seemed very glad , and fell into my mood of planning how it should all be managed ; how Sally and I should take care of the baby the hours that she was away at Mr Bradshaw 's ; but by - and - by she became silent and thoughtful , and knelt down by me and hid her face in my lap , and shook a little as if she was crying ; and then I heard her speak in a very low smothered voice , for her head was still bent down quite hanging down , indeed , so that I could not see her face , so I stooped to listen , and I heard her say , ' Do you think I should be good enough to teach little girls , Miss Benson ? ' She said it so humbly and fearfully that all I thought of was how to cheer her , and I answered and asked her if she did not hope to be good enough to bring up her own darling to be a brave Christian man ? And she lifted up her head , and I saw her eyes looking wild and wet and earnest , and she said , ' With God 's help , that will I try to make my child . ' And I said then , ' Ruth , as you strive and as you pray for your own child , so you must strive and pray to make Mary and Elizabeth good , if you are trusted with them . ' And she said out quite clear , though her face was hidden from me once more , ' I will strive , and I will pray . ' You would not have had any fears , Thurstan , if you could have heard and seen her last night . "
84930	84936	84938	84938	he	2252	" I have no fear , "
84942	84949	84954	84954	he	2252	" Let the plan go on . "
84957	84997	84954	84954	he	2252	" But I am glad it was so far arranged before I heard of it . My indecision about right and wrong my perplexity as to how far we are to calculate consequences grows upon me , I fear . "
84998	85020	84954	84954	he	2252	" You look tired and weary , dear . You should blame your body rather than your conscience at these times . "
85021	85027	84954	84954	he	2252	" A very dangerous doctrine . "
85441	85447	85453	85453	him	2260	" For ever in mischief , "
85906	85917	85918	85918	He	149	" If it is right , it shall be done ! "
86007	86049	85997	85997	he	149	" As you can not remember this of yourself , I must give you a little pain to make you remember it . I am very sorry it is necessary , and that you can not recollect without my doing so . "
86095	86116	86118	86118	she	154	" And what may ye be going to do with that fine switch I saw ye gathering , Master Thurstan ? "
86140	86146	86148	86149	Mr Benson	149	" Go away , Sally , "
86160	86188	86120	86120	her	154	" I 'll not stir never a step till you give me that switch , as you 've got for some mischief , I 'll be bound . "
86189	86210	86212	86213	Mr Benson	149	" Sally ! remember where it is said , ' He that spareth the rod , spoileth the child , ' "
86217	86340	86342	86342	she	2289	" Aye , I remember ; and I remember a bit more than you want me to remember , I reckon . It were King Solomon as spoke them words , and it were King Solomon 's son that were King Rehoboam , and no great shakes either . I can remember what is said on him , 2 Chronicles , xii . chapter , 14th verse : ' And he , ' that 's King Rehoboam , the lad that tasted the rod , ' did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord . ' I 've not been reading my chapters every night for fifty year to be caught napping by a Dissenter , neither ! "
86346	86352	86342	86342	she	2289	" Come along , Leonard . "
86381	86384	86386	86386	she	2289	" Come ! "
86396	86417	86390	86391	The boy	4407	" If you want to whip me , uncle , you may do it . I do n't much mind . "
86476	86521	86471	86471	She	154	" I think it 's for them without sin to throw stones at a poor child , and cut up good laburnum - branches to whip him . I only do as my betters do , when I call Leonard 's mother Mrs Denbigh . "
86628	86651	86617	86617	he	110	" Mamma ! mamma ! I will be good I make a promise ; I will speak true I make a promise . "
86855	86861	86813	86813	she	663	" wait patiently upon God , "
87087	87103	87066	87066	she	663	" Sally ! I 'm looking a great deal older than I used to do ! "
87139	87170	87176	87176	her	663	" To be sure ! I suppose we all on us do . But two - and - fourpence a dozen is too much to make us pay for it . "
87188	87191	87193	87194	Miss Benson	149	" Sally ! "
87196	87222	87193	87194	Miss Benson	149	" my hair is nearly white . The last time I looked it was only pepper - and - salt . What must I do ? "
87223	87233	87235	87235	Sally	154	" Do why , what would the wench do ? "
87239	87277	87235	87235	Sally	154	" Ye're never going to be taken in , at your time of life , by hair - dyes and such gimcracks , as can only take in young girls whose wisdom - teeth are not cut . "
87278	87289	87291	87292	Miss Benson	149	" And who are not very likely to want them , "
87296	87372	87291	87292	Miss Benson	149	" No ! but you see , Sally , it 's very awkward having such grey hair , and feeling so young . Do you know , Sally , I 've as great a mind for dancing , when I hear a lively tune on the street - organs , as ever ; and as great a mind to sing when I 'm happy to sing in my old way , Sally , you know . "
87373	87383	87385	87385	Sally	154	" Aye , you had it from a girl , "
87387	87436	87385	87385	Sally	154	" and many a time , when the door 's been shut , I did not know if it was you in the parlour , or a big bumble - bee in the kitchen , as was making that drumbling noise . I heard you at it yesterday . "
87437	87456	87458	87459	Miss Benson	149	" But an old woman with grey hair ought not to have a fancy for dancing or singing , "
87461	87468	87470	87470	Sally	154	" Whatten nonsense are ye talking ? "
87476	87508	87470	87470	Sally	154	" Calling yoursel ' an old woman when you 're better than ten years younger than me ! and many a girl has grey hair at five - and - twenty . "
87509	87531	87385	87385	Sally	154	" But I 'm more than five - and - twenty , Sally . I 'm fifty - seven next May ! "
87532	87559	87470	87470	Sally	154	" More shame for ye , then , not to know better than to talk of dyeing your hair . I can not abide such vanities ! "
87560	87657	87385	87385	Sally	154	" Oh , dear ! Sally , when will you understand what I mean ? I want to know how I am to keep remembering how old I am , so as to prevent myself from feeling so young ? I was quite startled just now to see my hair in the glass , for I can generally tell if my cap is straight by feeling . I 'll tell you what I 'll do I 'll cut off a piece of my grey hair , and plait it together for a marker in my Bible ! "
87673	87694	87668	87668	Sally	154	" You 'll be taking to painting your cheeks next , now you 've once thought of dyeing your hair . "
87920	87931	87898	87898	her	154	" I 'm feared I shall never see thirty again . "
88201	88207	88247	88247	Ruth	87	" morn or dusky eve . "
88300	88308	88293	88294	Miss Benson	149	" How very handsome Ruth is grown ! "
88316	88352	88311	88311	Sally	154	" Yes ! she 's well enough . Beauty is deceitful , and favour a snare , and I 'm thankful the Lord has spared me from such man - traps and spring - guns . "
88803	88813	88795	88795	she	87	" Thy will , not mine , be done ; "
90146	90156	90158	90158	she	173	" How I should like to see a play ! "
90160	90164	90166	90167	her brother	988	" Should you ? "
90171	90182	90184	90184	she	173	" Yes , to be sure ! Just hear this ! "
90194	90206	90208	90208	he	988	" Those newspaper people can make an article out of anything , "
90212	90236	90208	90208	he	988	" I 've seen the man myself , and it was all very well , but nothing to make such a fuss about . "
90237	90277	90184	90184	she	173	" You ! you seen ! Have you seen a play , Richard ? Oh , why did you never tell me before ? Tell me all about it ! Why did you never name seeing in your letters ? "
90285	90314	90278	90278	He	988	" Oh ! at first it strikes one rather , but after a while one cares no more for the theatre than one does for mince - pies . "
90315	90326	90328	90328	Jemima	173	" Oh , I wish I might go to London ! "
90332	90367	90328	90328	Jemima	173	" I 've a great mind to ask papa to let me go to the George Smiths ' , and then I could see . I would not think him like mince - pies . "
90368	90377	90379	90379	Richard	156	" You must not do any such thing ! "
90387	90415	90379	90379	Richard	156	" My father would never allow you to go to the theatre ; and the George Smiths are such old fogeys they would be sure to tell . "
90416	90431	90328	90328	Jemima	173	" How do you go , then ? Does my father give you leave ? "
90432	90447	90379	90379	Richard	156	" Oh ! many things are right for men which are not for girls . "
90462	90469	90471	90471	he	156	" You need not name it , "
90476	90480	90482	90482	she	173	" Name what ? "
90494	90507	90455	90455	he	156	" Oh , name my going once or twice to the theatre ! "
90508	90517	90519	90519	she	173	" No , I sha n't name it ! "
90521	90531	90519	90519	she	173	" No one here would care to hear it . "
91797	91803	91804	91804	she	219	" What business has he , "
91808	91982	91804	91804	she	219	" to lecture me ? Often I can hardly bear it from papa , and I will not bear it from him . He treats me just like a child , and as if I should lose all my present opinions when I know more of the world . I am sure I should like never to know the world , if it was to make me think as he does , hard man that he is ! I wonder what made him take Jem Brown on as gardener again , if he does not believe that above one criminal in a thousand is restored to goodness . I 'll ask him , some day , if that was not acting on impulse rather than principle . Poor impulse ! how you do get abused . But I will tell Mr Farquhar I will not let him interfere with me . If I do what papa bids me , no one has a right to notice whether I do it willingly or not . "
92020	92023	92004	92004	She	2439	" lecture , "
92120	92156	92157	92157	Mary	124	" Lizzie , did you see how the tears came into Mimie 's eyes when Mr Farquhar looked so displeased when she said good people were always dull ? I think she 's in love . "
92177	92182	92184	92184	Lizzie	76	" I do n't , "
92186	92207	92184	92184	Lizzie	76	" I know I cry often enough when papa is cross , and I 'm not in love with him . "
92208	92220	92157	92157	Mary	124	" Yes ! but you do n't look as Mimie did . "
92221	92235	92184	92184	Lizzie	76	" Do n't call her Mimie you know papa does not like it . "
92236	92280	92157	92157	Mary	124	" Yes ; but there are so many things papa does not like I can never remember them all . Never mind about that ; but listen to something I 've got to tell you , if you 'll never , never tell . "
92281	92295	92184	92184	Lizzie	76	" No , indeed I wo n't , Mary . What is it ? "
92296	92302	92157	92157	Mary	124	" Not to Mrs Denbigh ? "
92303	92312	92184	92184	Lizzie	76	" No , not even to Mrs Denbigh . "
92313	92325	92157	92157	Mary	124	" Well , then , the other day last Friday , Mimie "
92326	92329	92334	92334	Elizabeth	76	" Jemima ! "
92336	92345	92348	92348	Mary	124	" Jemima , if it must be so , "
92368	92368	92363	92363	you	76	"
92369	92372	92374	92374	Elizabeth	76	" What ? "
92401	92470	92363	92363	you	76	" Why , a piece of paper , with dull - looking lines upon it , just like the scientific dialogues ; and I remembered all about it . It was once when Mr Farquhar had been telling us that a bullet does not go in a straight line , but in a something curve , and he drew some lines on a piece of paper ; and Mimie "
92471	92474	92477	92477	Elizabeth	76	" Jemima , "
92479	92548	92363	92363	you	76	" Well , well ! she had treasured it up , and written in a corner , ' W. F. , April 3rd . ' Now , that 's rather like love , is not it ? For Jemima hates useful information just as much as I do , and that 's saying a great deal ; and yet she had kept this paper , and dated it . "
92549	92643	92363	92363	you	76	" If that 's all , I know Dick keeps a paper with Miss Benson 's name written on it , and yet he 's not in love with her ; and perhaps Jemima may like Mr Farquhar , and he may not like her . It seems such a little while since her hair was turned up , and he has always been a grave middle - aged man ever since I can recollect ; and then , have you never noticed how often he finds fault with her almost lectures her ? "
92644	92649	92651	92651	Mary	124	" To be sure , "
92653	92687	92651	92651	Mary	124	" but he may be in love , for all that . Just think how often papa lectures mamma ; and yet , of course , they 're in love with each other . "
92688	92695	92697	92697	Elizabeth	76	" Well ! we shall see , "
92924	92926	92916	92916	she	173	" love "
93048	93064	93045	93046	her mother	719	" Jemima ! your father wants to speak to you in the dining - room . "
93065	93069	93071	93072	the girl	1025	" What for ? "
93074	93121	93045	93046	her mother	719	" Oh ! he is fidgeted by something Mr Farquhar said to me , and which I repeated . I am sure I thought there was no harm in it , and your father always likes me to tell him what everybody says in his absence . "
93151	93174	93134	93134	He	417	" Oh , Jemima ! is that you ? Has your mother told you what I want to speak to you about ? "
93175	93178	93180	93180	Jemima	173	" No ! "
93182	93186	93180	93180	Jemima	173	" Not exactly . "
93187	93233	93134	93134	He	417	" She has been telling me what proves to me how very seriously you must have displeased and offended Mr Farquhar , before he could have expressed himself to her as he did , when he left the house . You know what he said ? "
93234	93237	93239	93239	Jemima	173	" No ! "
93247	93258	93239	93239	Jemima	173	" He has no right to say anything about me . "
93274	93285	93287	93288	Mr Bradshaw	156	" No right ! what do you mean , Jemima ? "
93294	93344	93287	93288	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Surely you must know that I hope he may one day be your husband ; that is to say , if you prove yourself worthy of the excellent training I have given you . I can not suppose Mr Farquhar would take any undisciplined girl as a wife . "
93383	93390	93391	93391	he	417	" But you can not suppose , "
93394	93403	93391	93391	he	417	" that Mr Farquhar will consent to marry you "
93404	93410	93412	93412	Jemima	173	" Consent to marry me ! "
93458	93536	93537	93537	he	417	" if you give way to a temper which , although you have never dared to show it to me , I am well aware exists , although I hoped the habits of self - examination I had instilled had done much to cure you of manifesting it . At one time , Richard promised to be the more headstrong of the two ; now , I must desire you to take pattern by him . Yes , "
93548	93618	93537	93537	he	417	" it would be a most fortunate connexion for you in every way . I should have you under my own eye , and could still assist you in the formation of your character , and I should be at hand to strengthen and confirm your principles . Mr Farquhar 's connexion with the firm would be convenient and agreeable to me in a pecuniary point of view . He "
93685	93696	93697	93697	Jemima	173	" Has Mr Farquhar ever spoken to you about it ? "
93729	93801	93803	93804	Mr Bradshaw	156	" No , not spoken . It has been implied between us for some time . At least , I have been so aware of his intentions that I have made several allusions , in the course of business , to it , as a thing that might take place . He can hardly have misunderstood ; he must have seen that I perceived his design , and approved of it , "
93897	93975	93889	93889	he	204	" The whole thing is so suitable the advantages arising from the connexion are so obvious ; besides which , I am quite aware , from many little speeches of Mr Farquhar 's , that he contemplates marriage at no very distant time ; and he seldom leaves Eccleston , and visits few families besides our own certainly , none that can compare with ours in the advantages you have all received in moral and religious training . "
94040	94090	94037	94037	he	204	" But you must be aware , Jemima , that you do very little credit to the education I have given you , when you make such an impression as you must have done to - day , before Mr Farquhar could have said what he did of you ! "
94091	94097	94099	94099	Jemima	173	" What did he say ? "
94112	94169	94037	94037	he	204	" Your mother says he remarked to her , ' What a pity it is , that Jemima can not maintain her opinions without going into a passion ; and what a pity it is , that her opinions are such as to sanction , rather than curb , these fits of rudeness and anger ! ' "
94170	94176	94178	94178	Jemima	173	" Did he say that ? "
94197	94205	94207	94208	her father	417	" I have no doubt he did , "
94212	94271	94207	94208	her father	417	" Your mother is in the habit of repeating accurately to me what takes place in my absence ; besides which , the whole speech is not one of hers ; she has not altered a word in the repetition , I am convinced . I have trained her to habits of accuracy very unusual in a woman . "
94349	94403	94333	94333	She	173	" I have said enough now , I hope , to make you behave in a becoming manner to Mr Farquhar ; if your temper is too unruly to be always under your own control , at least have respect to my injunctions , and take some pains to curb it before him . "
94404	94409	94411	94411	Jemima	173	" May I go ? "
94418	94422	94424	94425	her father	417	" You may , "
94484	94510	94512	94513	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Nothing can be more gentle and docile than she is when spoken to in the proper manner . I must give Farquhar a hint , "
94556	94588	94590	94590	she	173	" So ! I am to behave well , not because it is right not because it is right but to show off before Mr Farquhar . Oh , Mr Farquhar ! "
94603	94673	94590	94590	she	173	" I did not think so of you an hour ago . I did not think you could choose a wife in that cold - hearted way , though you did profess to act by rule and line ; but you think to have me , do you ? because it is fitting and suitable , and you want to be married , and ca n't spare time for wooing "
94689	94814	94815	94815	She	2473	" And how often I have thought you were too grand for me ! but now I know better . Now I can believe that all you do is done from calculation ; you are good because it adds to your business credit you talk in that high strain about principle because it sounds well , and is respectable and even these things are better than your cold way of looking out for a wife , just as you would do for a carpet , to add to your comforts , and settle you respectably . But I wo n't be that wife . You shall see something of me which shall make you not acquiesce so quietly in the arrangements of the firm . "
94833	94892	94827	94827	she	2473	" Only an hour ago I was hoping I do n't know what I was hoping but I thought oh ! how I was deceived ! I thought he had a true , deep , loving , manly heart , which God might let me win ; but now I know he has only a calm , calculating head "
95364	95370	95371	95371	he	156	" Is Mrs Denbigh here ? "
95380	95390	95359	95359	He	156	" Yes , sir ; she is just come . "
95391	95411	95371	95371	he	156	" Beg her to come to me in this room as soon as she can leave the young ladies . "
95415	95543	95544	95544	He	2484	" Sit down , Mrs Denbigh ; sit down . I want to have a little conversation with you ; not about your pupils , they are going on well under your care , I am sure ; and I often congratulate myself on the choice I made I assure you I do . But now I want to speak to you about Jemima . She is very fond of you , and perhaps you could take some opportunity of observing to her in short , of saying to her , that she is behaving very foolishly in fact , disgusting Mr Farquhar who was , I know , inclined to like her by the sullen , sulky way she behaves in , when he is by . "
95578	95597	95544	95544	He	2484	" I hardly understand , sir . You are displeased with Miss Bradshaw 's manners to Mr Farquhar . "
95598	95641	95544	95544	He	2484	" Well , well ! not quite that ; I am displeased with her manners they are sulky and abrupt , particularly when he is by and I want you of whom she is so fond to speak to her about it . "
95642	95668	95544	95544	He	2484	" But I have never had the opportunity of noticing them . Whenever I have seen her , she has been most gentle and affectionate . "
95669	95691	95693	95694	Mr Bradshaw	156	" But I think you do not hesitate to believe me , when I say that I have noticed the reverse , "
95700	95739	95741	95741	Ruth	87	" No , sir . I beg your pardon if I have expressed myself so badly as to seem to doubt . But am I to tell Miss Bradshaw that you have spoken of her faults to me ? "
95757	95785	95544	95544	He	2484	" If you would allow me to finish what I have got to say , without interruption , I could then tell you what I do wish . "
95786	95794	95796	95796	Ruth	87	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
95800	95866	95867	95868	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I wish you to join our circle occasionally in an evening ; Mrs Bradshaw shall send you an invitation when Mr Farquhar is likely to be here . Warned by me , and , consequently , with your observation quickened , you can hardly fail to notice instances of what I have pointed out ; and then I will trust to your own good sense "
95878	95888	95544	95544	He	2484	" to find an opportunity to remonstrate with her . "
95906	95975	95896	95896	he	156	" Only a minute , Mrs Denbigh . I am quite aware that , in requesting your presence occasionally in the evening , I shall be trespassing upon the time which is , in fact , your money ; you may be assured that I shall not forget this little circumstance , and you can explain what I have said on this head to Benson and his sister . "
95976	95986	95987	95987	Ruth	87	" I am afraid I can not do it , "
96041	96068	96036	96036	he	156	" No one so able , Mrs Denbigh . I have observed many qualities in you observed when , perhaps , you have little thought it . "
96349	96356	96358	96358	Jemima	173	" Oh ! you beautiful creature ! "
96360	96417	96358	96358	Jemima	173	" with your still , calm , heavenly face , what are you to know of earth 's trials ! You have lost your beloved by death but that is a blessed sorrow ; the sorrow I have pulls me down and down , and makes me despise and hate every one not you , though . "
97242	97262	97264	97265	Miss Benson	149	" Ruthie , what gown shall you wear to - night ? your dark grey one , I suppose ? "
97267	97286	97225	97225	They	2512	" Yes , I suppose so . I never thought of it ; but that is my best . "
97287	97311	97312	97312	Ruth	87	" Well ; then , I shall quill up a ruff for you . You know I am a famous quiller of net . "
97353	97359	97361	97361	Leonard	110	" Is not mamma pretty ? "
97369	97377	97379	97380	Miss Benson	149	" She looks very nice and tidy , "
97396	97405	97407	97407	Ruth	87	" I think my ruff looks so nice , "
97476	97485	97487	97488	Miss Benson	149	" You should have light gloves , Ruth , "
97516	97526	97528	97528	Sally	154	" They say them gloves is made of chickens'-skins , "
97534	97544	97528	97528	Sally	154	" I wonder how they set about skinning 'em . "
97545	97550	97552	97553	Mr Benson	149	" Here , Ruth , "
97561	97611	97552	97553	Mr Benson	149	" here 's a rose or two for you . I am sorry there are no more ; I hoped I should have had my yellow rose out by this time , but the damask and the white are in a warmer corner , and have got the start . "
97659	97691	97692	97692	She	87	" We saw you coming we 've been watching for you we want you to come round the garden before tea ; papa is not come in yet . Do come ! "
97886	97896	97898	97898	she	158	" Oh ! I thought your father was here , "
97915	97930	97932	97932	she	158	" Thank you , Mrs Denbigh , for coming to us to - night , "
98160	98165	98148	98148	he	996	" keeping a calm sough "
98747	98762	98740	98740	Ruth	87	" No ! you must go . You must keep to what is right , "
99286	99293	99295	99295	he	204	" Good night , Mrs Denbigh , "
99297	99316	99295	99295	he	204	" Good night . Thank you . I am obliged to you I am exceedingly obliged to you . "
99393	99423	99385	99386	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Oh ! Mrs Denbigh need not trouble you , Farquhar . I have servants at liberty at any moment to attend on her , if she wishes it . "
99467	99471	99473	99473	Ruth	87	" Dear Jemima ! "
99475	99501	99473	99473	Ruth	87	" I am so glad to see you looking better to - night ! You quite frightened me this morning , you looked so ill . "
99502	99506	99508	99508	Jemima	173	" Did I ? "
99510	99533	99534	99534	she	173	" Oh , Ruth ! I have been so unhappy lately . I want you to come and put me to rights , "
99540	99574	99534	99534	she	173	" You know I 'm a sort of out - pupil of yours , though we are so nearly of an age . You ought to lecture me , and make me good . "
99575	99581	99583	99583	Ruth	87	" Should I , dear ? "
99585	99598	99583	99583	Ruth	87	" I do n't think I 'm the one to do it . "
99599	99615	99534	99534	she	173	" Oh , yes ! you are you 've done me good to - night . "
99616	99633	99635	99635	Ruth	87	" Well , if I can do anything for you , tell me what it is ? "
99639	99647	99649	99649	Jemima	173	" Oh , not now not now , "
99651	99702	99649	99649	Jemima	173	" I could not tell you here . It 's a long story , and I do n't know that I can tell you at all . Mamma might come up at any moment , and papa would be sure to ask what we had been talking about so long . "
99703	99711	99713	99713	Ruth	87	" Take your own time , love , "
99715	99733	99713	99713	Ruth	87	" only remember , as far as I can , how glad I am to help you . "
99734	99743	99745	99745	Jemima	173	" You 're too good , my darling ! "
99749	99755	99757	99757	Ruth	87	" Do n't say so , "
99768	99775	99764	99764	she	87	" God knows I am not . "
99776	99787	99789	99789	Jemima	173	" Well ! we 're none of us too good , "
99791	99824	99789	99789	Jemima	173	" I know that . But you are very good . Nay , I wo n't call you so , if it makes you look so miserable . But come away downstairs . "
99997	100007	100009	100009	she	173	" What a favourite Mrs Denbigh is with papa , "
100011	100038	100009	100009	she	173	" I am sure I do n't wonder at it . Did you notice , mamma , how he thanked her for coming here last night ? "
100039	100052	100053	100054	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Yes , dear ; but I do n't think it was all "
100072	100077	100079	100079	Jemima	173	" Not all what ? "
100094	100105	100107	100108	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Not all because Mrs Denbigh came to tea here , "
100110	100127	100129	100129	Jemima	173	" Why , what else could he be thanking her for ? What has she done ? "
100141	100153	100155	100156	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" I do n't know if I ought to tell you , "
100158	100164	100166	100166	Jemima	173	" Oh , very well ! "
100171	100190	100129	100129	Jemima	173	" Nay , dear ! your papa never said I was not to tell ; perhaps I may . "
100191	100202	100155	100156	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Never mind ! I do n't want to hear , "
100243	100253	100255	100256	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" I think I may tell you , though , "
100290	100333	100285	100286	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" I think you deserve to know . It is partly your doing that papa is so pleased with Mrs Denbigh . He is going to buy her a silk gown this morning , and I think you ought to know why . "
100334	100337	100339	100339	Jemima	173	" Why ? "
100341	100356	100285	100286	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Because papa is so pleased to find that you mind what she says . "
100357	100395	100397	100397	Jemima	173	" I mind what she says ! To be sure I do , and always did . But why should papa give her a gown for that ? I think he ought to give it me rather , "
100402	100464	100518	100518	she	173	" I am sure he would , dear ; he will give you one , I am certain , if you want one . He was so pleased to see you like your old self to Mr Farquhar last night . We neither of us could think what had come over you this last month ; but now all seems right . "
100497	100505	100507	100507	she	173	" I am glad you were pleased , "
100521	100539	100518	100518	she	173	" But you have not told me what Mrs Denbigh had to do with my good behaviour . "
100540	100550	100552	100553	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Did not she speak to you about it ? "
100558	100582	100584	100584	Jemima	173	" No ; why should she ? She has no right to criticise what I do . She would not be so impertinent , "
100592	100613	100518	100518	she	173	" Yes , love ! she would have had a right , for papa had desired her to do it . "
100614	100626	100518	100518	she	173	" Papa desired her ! What do you mean , mamma ? "
100627	100642	100644	100645	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Oh , dear ! I dare say I should not have told you , "
100662	100741	100743	100744	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Only you spoke as if it would be impertinent in Mrs Denbigh , and I am sure she would not do anything that was impertinent . You know , it would be but right for her to do what papa told her ; and he said a great deal to her , the other day , about finding out why you were so cross , and bringing you right . And you are right now , dear ! "
100767	100788	100743	100744	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Then papa is going to give Mrs Denbigh a gown because I was civil to Mr Farquhar last night ? "
100789	100794	100796	100797	Mrs Bradshaw	158	" Yes , dear ! "
100874	100897	100870	100870	herself	87	" Are you sure , mamma , that papa asked Mrs Denbigh to make me behave differently ? It seems so strange . "
100898	100928	100929	100929	Jemima	173	" I am quite sure . He spoke to her last Friday morning in the study . I remember it was Friday , because Mrs Dean was working here . "
101318	101340	101343	101344	Mr Farquhar	204	" Suppose a delay of a month in requiring payment might save a man 's credit prevent his becoming a bankrupt ? "
101346	101403	101343	101344	Mr Farquhar	204	" I would not give it him . I would let him have money to set up again as soon as he had passed the Bankruptcy Court ; if he never passed , I might , in some cases , make him an allowance ; but I would always keep my justice and my charity separate . "
101404	101426	101474	101475	Mr Farquhar	204	" And yet charity in your sense of the word degrades ; justice , tempered with mercy and consideration , elevates . "
101427	101459	101343	101344	Mr Farquhar	204	" That is not justice justice is certain and inflexible . No ! Mr Farquhar , you must not allow any Quixotic notions to mingle with your conduct as a tradesman . "
101681	101684	101686	101687	Mr Bradshaw	156	" admirable management "
102173	102247	102134	102134	he	204	" It was only in March last March , he called me ' dear Jemima . ' Ah , do n't I remember it well ? The pretty nosegay of green - house flowers that he gave me in exchange for the wild daffodils and how he seemed to care for the flowers I gave him and how he looked at me , and thanked me that is all gone and over now . "
102256	102274	102275	102275	She	154	" Oh , Jemima , how nice and cool you are , sitting in this shady room ! "
102282	102301	102275	102275	She	154	" We have been such a long walk ! We are so tired . It is so hot . "
102302	102310	102312	102312	she	154	" Why did you go , then ? "
102314	102339	102341	102341	Mary	124	" Oh ! we wanted to go . We would not have stayed at home on any account . It has been so pleasant , "
102343	102356	102358	102358	Elizabeth	76	" We 've been to Scaurside Wood , to gather wild strawberries , "
102360	102412	102358	102358	Elizabeth	76	" Such a quantity ! We 've left a whole basketful in the dairy . Mr Farquhar says he 'll teach us how to dress them in the way he learnt in Germany , if we can get him some hock . Do you think papa will let us have some ? "
102413	102420	102422	102422	Jemima	173	" Was Mr Farquhar with you ? "
102432	102476	102478	102478	Elizabeth	76	" Yes ; we told him this morning that mamma wanted us to take some old linen to the lame man at Scaurside Farm , and that we meant to coax Mrs Denbigh to let us go into the wood and gather strawberries , "
102480	102491	102493	102497	the quick - witted Mary	124	" I thought he would make some excuse and come , "
102534	102542	102544	102544	Elizabeth	76	" Did you ? I did not , "
102546	102572	102544	102544	Elizabeth	76	" At least I never thought about it . I was quite startled when I heard his horse 's feet behind us on the road . "
102573	102596	102597	102597	Jemima	173	" He said he was going to the farm , and could take our basket . Was not it kind of him ? "
102606	102669	102603	102603	Mary	124	" You know it 's a great pull up to the farm , and we were so hot already . The road was quite white and baked ; it hurt my eyes terribly . I was so glad when Mrs Denbigh said we might turn into the wood . The light was quite green there , the branches are so thick overhead . "
102670	102680	102682	102682	Elizabeth	76	" And there are whole beds of wild strawberries , "
102707	102752	102703	102703	Elizabeth	76	" You know where the grey rock crops out , do n't you , Jemima ? Well , there was a complete carpet of strawberry runners . So pretty ! And we could hardly step without treading the little bright scarlet berries under foot . "
102753	102761	102764	102764	Mary	124	" We did so wish for Leonard , "
102766	102787	102703	102703	Elizabeth	76	" Yes ! but Mrs Denbigh gathered a great many for him . And Mr Farquhar gave her all his . "
102788	102802	102804	102804	Jemima	173	" I thought you said he had gone on to Dawson 's farm , "
102806	102879	102703	102703	Elizabeth	76	" Oh , yes ! he just went up there ; and then he left his horse there , like a wise man , and came to us in the pretty , cool , green wood . Oh , Jemima , it was so pretty little flecks of light coming down here and there through the leaves , and quivering on the ground . You must go with us to - morrow . "
102880	102883	102885	102885	Mary	124	" Yes , "
102887	102905	102885	102885	Mary	124	" we 're going again to - morrow . We could not gather nearly all the strawberries . "
102906	102918	102703	102703	Elizabeth	76	" And Leonard is to go too , to - morrow . "
102919	102963	102885	102885	Mary	124	" Yes ! we thought of such a capital plan . That 's to say , Mr Farquhar thought of it we wanted to carry Leonard up the hill in a king 's cushion , but Mrs Denbigh would not hear of it . "
102964	102982	102703	102703	Elizabeth	76	" She said it would tire us so ; and yet she wanted him to gather strawberries ! "
102983	102987	102989	102989	Mary	124	" And so , "
103003	103017	102995	102997	the two girls	2607	" Mr Farquhar is to bring him up before him on his horse . "
103018	103032	103034	103034	Elizabeth	76	" You 'll go with us , wo n't you , dear Jemima ? "
103036	103041	103034	103034	Elizabeth	76	" it will be at "
103042	103050	103052	103052	Jemima	173	" No ! I ca n't go ! "
103056	103065	103052	103052	Jemima	173	" Do n't ask me I ca n't . "
103110	103141	103101	103101	She	173	" Go upstairs and take off your things . You know papa does not like you to come into this room in the shoes in which you have been out . "
103468	103478	103480	103483	Jemima 's better angel	2615	" What was this terrible demon in her heart ? "
103485	103555	103480	103483	Jemima 's better angel	2615	" Was she , indeed , given up to possession ? Was not this the old stinging hatred which had prompted so many crimes ? The hatred of all sweet virtues which might win the love denied to us ? The old anger that wrought in the elder brother 's heart , till it ended in the murder of the gentle Abel , while yet the world was young ? "
103556	103573	103575	103575	Jemima	173	" Oh , God ! help me ! I did not know I was so wicked , "
103833	103874	103803	103803	They	2617	" Yes ! Leonard came up before Mr Farquhar . Oh ! how hot it is , Jemima ; do sit down , and I 'll tell you about it , but I ca n't if you keep walking so ! "
103875	103885	103887	103887	Jemima	173	" I ca n't sit still to - day , "
103902	103915	103887	103887	Jemima	173	" Tell me ! I can hear you while I walk about . "
103916	103938	103803	103803	They	2617	" Oh ! but I ca n't shout ; I can hardly speak I am so tired . Mr Farquhar brought Leonard "
103939	103947	103949	103949	Jemima	173	" You 've told me that before , "
103953	103986	103988	103988	Elizabeth	76	" Well ! I do n't know what else to tell . Somebody had been since yesterday , and gathered nearly all the strawberries off the grey rock . Jemima ! Jemima ! "
103992	104003	103988	103988	Elizabeth	76	" I am so dizzy I think I am ill . "
104108	104120	104122	104122	Jemima	173	" Give me the water . Run for mamma , Mary , "
104148	104154	104156	104156	Jemima	173	" Dear ! dear Lizzie ! "
104165	104174	104156	104156	Jemima	173	" I think you loved me , darling . "
104843	104870	104831	104831	Jemima	173	" Changed ! How do you mean ? How am I changed ? What do I say or do different from what I used to do ? "
105670	105681	105683	105683	he	156	" There are in round numbers about six hundred voters , "
105685	105749	105683	105683	he	156	" two hundred are decidedly in the Cranworth interest dare not offend Mr Cranworth , poor souls ! Two hundred more we may calculate upon as pretty certain factory hands , or people connected with our trade in some way or another who are indignant at the stubborn way in which Cranworth has contested the right of water ; two hundred are doubtful . "

105764	105774	105760	105762	the parliamentary agent	2687	" Of course , we must make them care . "
105918	105986	105912	105912	he	2687	" I have a notion I know of a man who will just suit your purpose . Plenty of money does not know what to do with it , in fact tired of yachting , travelling ; wants something new . I heard , through some of the means of intelligence I employ , that not very long ago he was wishing for a seat in Parliament . "
105987	105991	105993	105994	Mr Bradshaw	156	" A Liberal ? "
105996	106013	105912	105912	he	2687	" Decidedly . Belongs to a family who were in the Long Parliament in their day . "
106020	106023	106025	106025	he	156	" Dissenter ? "
106027	106043	105912	105912	he	2687	" No , no ! Not so far as that . But very lax Church . "
106044	106050	106052	106053	Mr Bradshaw	156	" What is his name ? "
106057	106085	105912	105912	he	2687	" Excuse me . Until I am certain that he would like to come forward for Eccleston , I think I had better not mention his name . "

Would you not rather seize the first weapon that came to hand ? And so do I. My great object in life , sir , is to reform the law of England , sir . Once get a majority of Liberal members into the House , and the thing is done . And I consider myself justified , for so high for , I may say , so holy an end , in using men 's weaknesses to work out my purpose . Of course , if men were angels , or even immaculate men invulnerable to bribes , we would not bribe . "
107464	107468	107470	107470	Jemima	173	" Could you ? "
107504	107511	107513	107515	the ardent barrister	2755	" We neither would nor could , "

107632	107759	107760	107760	he	2757	" then , I say , we must put all the squeamish scruples which might befit Utopia , or some such place , on one side , and treat men as they are . If they are avaricious , it is not we who have made them so ; but as we have to do with them , we must consider their failings in dealing with them ; if they have been careless or extravagant , or have had their little peccadillos , we must administer the screw . The glorious reform of the law will justify , in my idea , all means to obtain the end that law , from the profession of which I have withdrawn myself from perhaps a too scrupulous conscience ! "

107915	107940	107904	107904	he	204	" But in the present state of the world , as Mr Hickson says , it is rather difficult to act upon that precept . "

I do n't understand myself yet ; and it is a very intricate question , or so it appears to me , which I was going to put , really , earnestly , and humbly , for Mr Benson 's opinion . Now , Mr Benson , may I ask , if you always find it practicable to act strictly in accordance with that principle ? For if you do not , I am sure no man living can ! Are there not occasions when it is absolutely necessary to wade through evil to good ? I am not speaking in the careless , presumptuous way of that man yonder , "
108249	108280	108235	108235	he	204	" I am really anxious to hear what Mr Benson will say on the subject , for I know no one to whose candid opinion I should attach more weight . "

110685	110810	110681	110682	Mr Donne	233	" Oh , of course ! disagreeable necessity ! Better speak as little about such things as possible ; other people can be found to arrange all the dirty work . Neither you nor I would like to soil our fingers by it , I am sure . Four thousand pounds are in Mr Pilson 's hands , and I shall never inquire what becomes of them ; they may , very probably , be absorbed in the law expenses , you know . I shall let it be clearly understood from the hustings , that I most decidedly disapprove of bribery , and leave the rest to Hickson 's management . He is accustomed to these sort of things . I am not . "
110887	110900	110902	110902	she	173	" Do you know what Mr Donne reminds me of , mamma ? "
110921	110982	110862	110862	She	173	" No ! he is not like anybody I ever saw . He quite frightens me , by being so ready to open the door for me if I am going out of the room , and by giving me a chair when I come in . I never saw any one like him . Who is it , Jemima ? "
110983	110994	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Not any person not any human being , mamma , "
111001	111043	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Do you remember our stopping at Wakefield once , on our way to Scarborough , and there were horse - races going on somewhere , and some of the racers were in the stables at the inn where we dined ? "
111044	111056	110862	110862	She	173	" Yes ! I remember it ; but what about that ? "
111057	111105	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Why , Richard , somehow , knew one of the jockeys , and , as we were coming in from our ramble through the town , this man , or boy , asked us to look at one of the racers he had the charge of . "
111106	111112	110862	110862	She	173	" Well , my dear ! "
111113	111125	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Well , mamma ! Mr Donne is like that horse ! "
111126	111158	110862	110862	She	173	" Nonsense , Jemima ; you must not say so . I do n't know what your father would say , if he heard you likening Mr Donne to a brute . "
111159	111211	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Brutes are sometimes very beautiful , mamma . I am sure I should think it a compliment to be likened to a race - horse , such as the one we saw . But the thing in which they are alike , is the sort of repressed eagerness in both . "
111212	111296	110862	110862	She	173	" Eager ! Why , I should say there never was any one cooler than Mr Donne . Think of the trouble your papa has had this month past , and then remember the slow way in which Mr Donne moves when he is going out to canvass , and the low , drawling voice in which he questions the people who bring him intelligence . I can see your papa standing by , ready to shake them to get out their news . "
111297	111424	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" But Mr Donne 's questions are always to the point , and force out the grain without the chaff . And look at him , if any one tells him ill news about the election ! Have you never seen a dull red light come into his eyes ? That is like my race - horse . Her flesh quivered all over , at certain sounds and noises which had some meaning to her ; but she stood quite still , pretty creature ! Now , Mr Donne is just as eager as she was , though he may be too proud to show it . Though he seems so gentle , I almost think he is very headstrong in following out his own will . "
111425	111473	110862	110862	She	173	" Well ! do n't call him like a horse again , for I am sure papa would not like it . Do you know , I thought you were going to say he was like little Leonard , when you asked me who he was like . "
111474	111500	110996	110996	Jemima	173	" Leonard ! Oh , mamma , he is not in the least like Leonard . He is twenty times more like my race - horse .
111501	111536	110862	110862	She	173	" Now , my dear Jemima , do be quiet . Your father thinks racing so wrong , that I am sure he would be very seriously displeased if he were to hear you . "
111948	111960	111961	111961	he	156	" because his little girls had taken a fancy to it , "
112139	112155	112136	112136	Mary	124	" Oh , how charming ! Then we shall see this new member after all ! "
112160	112193	112157	112157	Elizabeth	76	" Yes ! I shall like to do that . But where must we be ? Papa will want the dining - room and this room , and where must we sit ? "
112194	112197	112199	112199	Ruth	87	" Oh ! "
112201	112230	112199	112199	Ruth	87	" in the dressing - room next to my room . All that your papa wants always , is that you are quiet and out of the way . "
112295	112304	112306	112306	Elizabeth	76	" Papa will never buy this dear place , "
112316	112363	112311	112311	she	76	" The sun is everything to it . The sea looks quite leaden to - day , and there is no sparkle on it . And the sands , that were so yellow and sun - speckled on Thursday , are all one dull brown now . "
112364	112375	112377	112377	Ruth	87	" Never mind ! to - morrow may be better , "
112381	112391	112393	112393	Mary	124	" I wonder what time they will come at ? "
112395	112427	112311	112311	she	76	" Your papa said they would be at the station at five o'clock . And the landlady at the Swan said it would take them half an hour to get here . "
112428	112437	112439	112439	Elizabeth	76	" And they are to dine at six ? "
112441	112444	112446	112446	Ruth	87	" Yes , "
112448	112512	112446	112446	Ruth	87	" And I think if we had our tea half an hour earlier , at half - past four , and then went out for a walk , we should be nicely out of the way just during the bustle of the arrival and dinner ; and we could be in the drawing - room ready against your papa came in after dinner . "
112513	112521	112523	112523	they	2858	" Oh ! that would be nice , "
112738	112744	112746	112746	Mary	124	" Papa and Mr Donne ! "
112748	112755	112746	112746	Mary	124	" Now we shall see him ! "
112756	112765	112767	112767	Elizabeth	76	" Which do you make out is him ? "
112769	112804	112746	112746	Mary	124	" Oh ! the tall one , to be sure . Do n't you see how papa always turns to him , as if he was speaking to him and not to the other ? "
112805	112811	112813	112813	Elizabeth	76	" Who is the other ? "
112815	112841	112843	112843	Ruth	87	" Mr Bradshaw said that Mr Farquhar and Mr Hickson would come with him . But that is not Mr Farquhar , I am sure , "
112902	112930	112898	112898	his	156	" Well , my dears ! we found there was an hour before dinner , so we came down upon the sands , and here you are . "
113007	113016	113005	113005	he	156	" My daughters ' governess , Mrs Denbigh . "
113119	113127	113129	113129	he	2876	" Are you fond of the sea ? "
113146	113160	113137	113137	he	2876	" Do you enjoy staying by the seaside ? I should rather ask . "
113164	113167	113137	113137	he	2876	" Yes , "
113580	113590	113592	113592	Elizabeth	76	" Are you not well , dear Mrs Denbigh ? "
113647	113665	113667	113667	she	87	" Well ! what are you doing here with me ? You should not be with me , "
113680	113686	113688	113688	Elizabeth	76	" You are sadly tired , "
113692	113721	113688	113688	Elizabeth	76	" Come home , and let me help you to bed . I will tell papa you are ill , and ask him to send for a doctor . "
113783	113827	113829	113829	she	87	" Yes ! I was tired . I am tired . Those sands oh ! those sands , those weary , dreadful sands ! But that is all over now . Only my heart aches still . Feel how it flutters and beats , "
113843	113851	113852	113852	she	87	" I am quite well , though , "
113872	113945	113947	113947	she	87	" We will go straight to the dressing - room , and read a chapter ; that will still my heart ; and then I 'll go to bed , and Mr Bradshaw will excuse me , I know , this one night . I only ask for one night . Put on your right frocks , dears , and do all you ought to do . But I know you will , "
113969	113981	113947	113947	she	87	" You are good and dear girls God keep you so ! "
114283	114306	114271	114271	Ruth	87	" Stay up here , dear Mrs Denbigh ! We 'll tell papa you are tired , and are gone to bed . "
114784	114790	114779	114779	his	220	" Tell Mrs Denbigh I hope "
114794	114796	114779	114779	his	220	" hopes "
114799	114801	114779	114779	his	220	" expect "
114814	114822	114803	114803	she	87	" and then she would see Mr Donne .
114971	114974	114966	114966	she	87	" Now , "
115008	115058	115060	115060	she	87	" If I might see him ! If I might see him ! If I might just ask him why he left me ; if I had vexed him in any way ; it was so strange so cruel ! It was not him ; it was his mother , "
115070	115085	115086	115086	she	87	" Oh , God ! but he might have found me out before this , "
115091	115114	115115	115115	she	87	" He did not care for me , as I did for him . He did not care for me at all , "
115122	115164	115166	115166	she	87	" He did me cruel harm . I can never again lift up my face in innocence . They think I have forgotten all , because I do not speak . Oh , darling love ! am I talking against you ? "
115170	115188	115166	115166	she	87	" I am so torn and perplexed ! You , who are the father of my child ! "
115249	115319	115237	115237	she	87	" He left me . He might have been hurried off , but he might have inquired he might have learnt , and explained . He left me to bear the burden and the shame ; and never cared to learn , as he might have done , of Leonard 's birth . He has no love for his child , and I will have no love for him . "
115341	115346	115337	115337	she	87	" Alas ! alas ! "
115382	115539	115540	115540	she	2934	" What am I thinking of ? Where am I ? I who have been praying these years and years to be worthy to be Leonard 's mother . My God ! what a depth of sin is in my heart ! Why , the old time would be as white as snow to what it would be now , if I sought him out , and prayed for the explanation , which should re - establish him in my heart . I who have striven or made a mock of trying to learn God 's holy will , in order to bring up Leonard into the full strength of a Christian I who have taught his sweet innocent lips to pray , ' Lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil ; ' and yet , somehow , I 've been longing to give him to his father , who is who is "
115552	115589	115547	115547	she	2934	" Oh , my God ! I do believe Leonard 's father is a bad man , and yet , oh ! pitiful God , I love him ; I can not forget I can not ! "
115694	115699	115692	115692	His	2935	" came into her mind .
115724	115746	115784	115784	she	2934	" I wonder if my darling is frightened with this blustering , noisy wind . I wonder if he is awake . "
115871	115935	115868	115868	she	2934	" Oh , my God , help me , for I am very weak . My God ! I pray Thee be my rock and my strong fortress , for I of myself am nothing . If I ask in His name , Thou wilt give it me . In the name of Jesus Christ I pray for strength to do Thy will ! "
115959	115969	115954	115954	God	110	" a very present help in time of trouble ; "
116065	116081	116059	116061	a soft child	2938	" Mrs Denbigh , may I come in , please ? I am so frightened ! "
116107	116132	116086	116086	Ruth	87	" Oh , Mrs Denbigh ! did you ever hear such a night ? I am so frightened ! and Mary sleeps so sound . "
116162	116191	116193	116193	she	76	" Why , how wet you are , Mrs Denbigh ! and there 's the window open , I do believe ! Oh , how cold it is ! "
116197	116205	116207	116207	Ruth	87	" Get into my bed , dear ! "
116209	116271	116293	116293	Ruth	87	" But do come too ! The candle gives such a strange light with that long wick , and , somehow , your face does not look like you . Please , put the candle out , and come to bed . I am so frightened , and it seems as if I should be safer if you were by me . "
116540	116546	116536	116536	she	87	" Thy will be done ! "
117614	117637	117593	117593	he	233	" Church ? how far a mile ? No ; I think I shall perform my devotions at home to - day . "
117677	117681	117673	117673	he	233	" used - up "
117870	117876	117878	117878	he	233	" How singular it is , "
117880	117914	117878	117878	he	233	" that the name of Ruth is so seldom chosen by those good people who go to the Bible before they christen their children . It is a pretty name , I think . "
117920	117925	117927	117927	he	156	" Why , Mary ! "
117929	117938	117927	117927	he	156	" is not that Mrs Denbigh 's name ? "
117939	117944	117946	117946	Mary	124	" Yes , papa , "
117950	117970	117946	117946	Mary	124	" and I know two other Ruths ; there 's Ruth Brown here , and Ruth Macartney at Eccleston . "
117971	118004	117927	117927	he	156	" And I have an aunt called Ruth , Mr Donne ! I do n't think your observation holds good . Besides my daughters ' governess , I know three other Ruths . "
118005	118033	117946	117946	Mary	124	" Oh ! I have no doubt I was wrong . It was just a speech of which one perceives the folly the moment it is made . "
118283	118293	118295	118295	he	2991	" I have changed my mind , you see , "
118299	118366	118295	118295	he	2991	" I have some curiosity to see the architecture of the church ; some of these old country churches have singular bits about them . Mr Bradshaw kindly directed me part of the way , but I was so much puzzled by ' turns to the right , ' and ' turns to the left , ' that I was quite glad to espy your party . "
118426	118466	118467	118467	He	2991	" The scenery here is of a kind new to me ; neither grand , wild , nor yet marked by high cultivation ; and yet it has great charms . It reminds me of some parts of Wales . "
118475	118485	118467	118467	He	2991	" You have been in Wales , I believe ? "
118567	118575	118576	118576	He	2991	" Have you never been in Wales ? "
118578	118580	118544	118544	He	2991	" never "
118583	118586	118544	118544	He	2991	" ever , "
118615	118624	118625	118625	she	87	" I have been in Wales , sir , "
118635	118681	118625	118625	she	87	" I was there many years ago . Events took place there , which contribute to make the recollection of that time most miserable to me . I shall be obliged to you , sir , if you will make no further reference to it . "
118735	118739	118741	118741	she	87	" most miserable , "
119340	119348	119325	119329	mortal creature to be had	3016	" Hills from whence cometh our help . "
119702	119723	119724	119724	Ruth	87	" I have much to say to you much to explain . I entreat you to give me the opportunity . "
119806	119809	119810	119812	the higher spirit	3033	" No ! "
119816	119822	119810	119812	the higher spirit	3033	" it must not be . "
119840	119855	119832	119832	She	87	" Mary , give your umbrella to Mr Donne , and come under mine . "
119898	119903	119905	119905	he	233	" You are unforgiving , "
119907	119946	119905	119905	he	233	" I only ask you to hear me . I have a right to be heard , Ruth ! I wo n't believe you are so much changed , as not to listen to me when I entreat . "
120745	120753	120731	120731	He	110	" for His mercy endureth for ever . "
121169	121212	121158	121158	He	233	" They dine early ; they are gone to church again . Mrs Denbigh was a member of the Establishment once ; and , though she attends chapel at home , she seems glad to have an opportunity of going to church . "
121225	121229	121158	121158	He	233	" Mrs Denbigh , "
121376	121443	121444	121445	Mr Donne	233	" It is really a shame to be indoors in such a place . Rain ? yes , it rained some hours ago , but now it is splendid weather . I feel myself quite qualified for guide , I assure you . I can show you all the beauties of the neighbourhood , and throw in a bog and a nest of vipers to boot . "
121576	121583	121562	121563	Mr Bradshaw	156	" very little for fourteen thousand pounds "
121884	121893	121881	121881	he	233	" I implore you ; five minutes alone . "
121929	121944	121916	121916	She	87	" Will you read the whole passage aloud ? I do not remember it . "
122375	122390	122369	122370	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Any message for Leonard beyond love , which is a matter of course ? "
122425	122430	122432	122432	he	110	" Who is Leonard ? "
122449	122456	122458	122458	Mary	124	" Mrs Denbigh 's little boy , "
122488	122492	122485	122485	he	110	" Our child ! "
122545	122562	122526	122526	he	110	" He will take him away from me ! He will take the child from me ! "
122649	122652	122648	122648	Leonard	110	" Child ! "
122703	122713	122717	122717	she	87	" He will take my child away from me ! "
123057	123060	123041	123041	his	110	" alley . "
123080	123099	123100	123100	Ruth	87	" Monday we did so - and - so ; Tuesday , so - and - so , c. "
123121	123813	123100	123100	Ruth	87	" In the middle of the damsons , when they were just on the fire , there was a knock at the door . My brother was out , and Sally was washing up , and I was stirring the preserve with my great apron and bib on ; so I bade Leonard come in from the garden and open the door . But I would have washed his face first , if I had known who it was ! It was Mr Bradshaw and the Mr Donne that they hope to send up to the House of Commons , as member of Parliament for Eccleston , and another gentleman , whose name I never heard . They had come canvassing ; and when they found my brother was out , they asked Leonard if they could see me . The child said , ' Yes ! if I could leave the damsons ; ' and straightway came to call me , leaving them standing in the passage . I whipped off my apron , and took Leonard by the hand , for I fancied I should feel less awkward if he was with me ; and then I went and asked them all into the study , for I thought I should like them to see how many books Thurstan had got . Then they began talking politics at me in a very polite manner , only I could not make head or tail of what they meant ; and Mr Donne took a deal of notice of Leonard , and called him to him ; and I am sure he noticed what a noble , handsome boy he was , though his face was very brown and red , and hot with digging , and his curls all tangled . Leonard talked back as if he had known him all his life , till , I think , Mr Bradshaw thought he was making too much noise , and bid him remember he ought to be seen , not heard . So he stood as still and stiff as a soldier , close to Mr Donne ; and as I could not help looking at the two , and thinking how handsome they both were in their different ways , I could not tell Thurstan half the messages the gentlemen left for him . But there was one thing more I must tell you , though I said I would not . When Mr Donne was talking to Leonard , he took off his watch and chain and put it round the boy 's neck , who was pleased enough , you may be sure . I bade him give it back to the gentleman , when they were all going away ; and I was quite surprised , and very uncomfortable , when Mr Donne said he had given it to Leonard , and that he was to keep it for his own . I could see Mr Bradshaw was annoyed , and he and the other gentleman spoke to Mr Donne , and I heard them say , ' too barefaced ; ' and I shall never forget Mr Donne 's proud , stubborn look back at them , nor his way of saying , ' I allow no one to interfere with what I choose to do with my own . ' And he looked so haughty and displeased , I durst say nothing at the time . But when I told Thurstan , he was very grieved and angry ; and said he had heard that our party were bribing , but that he never could have thought they would have tried to do it at his house . Thurstan is very much out of spirits about this election altogether ; and , indeed , it does make sad work up and down the town . However , he sent back the watch with a letter to Mr Bradshaw ; and Leonard was very good about it , so I gave him a taste of the new damson - preserve on his bread for supper . "
123961	124058	123918	123919	Mr Donne	233	" For our child 's sake , and in his name , I summon you to appoint a place where I can speak , and you can listen , undisturbed . The time must be on Sunday ; the limit of distance may be the circumference of your power of walking . My words may be commands , but my fond heart entreats . More I shall not say now , but , remember ! your boy 's welfare depends on your acceding to this request . Address B. D. , Post - Office , Eccleston . "
124150	124170	124142	124142	She	87	" The sands below the rocks , where we met you the other night . Time , afternoon church . "
124174	124203	124142	124142	She	87	" I shall not go to church this afternoon . You know the way , of course ; and I can trust you to go steadily by yourselves . "
124233	124248	124205	124205	they	3122	" Are you not well , dear Mrs Denbigh ? How cold you are ! "
124249	124258	124266	124266	she	87	" Yes , darling ! I am well ; "
124274	124294	124266	124266	she	87	" Go now , dears . Five o'clock will soon be here , and then we will have tea . "
124295	124302	124304	124304	they	3122	" And that will warm you ! "
124310	124318	124319	124319	she	87	" And then it will be over , "
124321	124324	124319	124319	she	87	" over . "
124636	124641	124642	124642	she	87	" Pray for me ! "
124706	124711	124713	124713	she	87	" It is he ! "
124945	124954	124956	124956	he	233	" This is kind ! my own Ruth , "
124968	124980	124936	124936	He	233	" What ! Ruth , have you no word for me ? "
124981	124988	124990	124990	Ruth	87	" I have nothing to say , "
124992	125017	124936	124936	He	233	" Why , you little revengeful creature ! And so I am to explain all before you will even treat me with decent civility . "
125018	125025	125027	125027	Ruth	87	" I do not want explanations , "
125034	125068	125027	125027	Ruth	87	" We must not speak of the past . You asked me to come in Leonard 's in my child 's name , and to hear what you had to say about him . "
125069	125130	125131	125131	he	3160	" But what I have to say about him relates to you even more . And how can we talk about him without recurring to the past ? That past , which you try to ignore I know you can not do it in your heart is full of happy recollections to me . Were you not happy in Wales ? "
125156	125184	125135	125135	his	3160	" You dare not speak ; you dare not answer me . Your heart will not allow you to prevaricate , and you know you were happy . "
125227	125254	125209	125209	her	87	" I was happy . I do not deny it . Whatever comes , I will not blench from the truth . I have answered you . "
125255	125259	125261	125261	he	3160	" And yet , "
125290	125326	125283	125283	she	87	" and yet , Ruth , we are not to recur to the past ! Why not ? If it was happy at the time , is the recollection of it so miserable to you ? "
125342	125356	125358	125358	she	87	" I came to hear what you had to say about my child , "
125366	125372	125327	125327	He	3160	" Our child , Ruth . "
125385	125394	125396	125396	she	87	" What have you to say about him ? "
125400	125403	125405	125405	he	3160	" Much , "
125406	125428	125373	125373	She	87	" much that may affect his whole life . But it all depends upon whether you will hear me or not . "
125429	125433	125405	125405	he	3160	" I listen . "
125434	125471	125472	125472	She	87	" Good Heavens ! Ruth , you will drive me mad . Oh ! what a changed person you are from the sweet , loving creature you were ! I wish you were not so beautiful . "
125486	125568	125405	125405	he	3160	" Will you hear me if I speak , though I may not begin all at once to talk of this boy a boy of whom any mother any parent , might be proud ? I could see that , Ruth . I have seen him ; he looked like a prince in that cramped , miserable house , and with no earthly advantages . It is a shame he should not have every kind of opportunity laid open before him . "
125673	125777	125797	125797	she	87	" Ruth ! you acknowledge we were happy once ; there were circumstances which , if I could tell you them all in detail , would show you how in my weak , convalescent state I was almost passive in the hands of others . Ah , Ruth ! I have not forgotten the tender nurse who soothed me in my delirium . When I am feverish , I dream that I am again at Llan - dhu , in the little old bed - chamber , and you , in white which you always wore then , you know flitting about me . "
125799	125805	125807	125807	he	3164	" We were happy then , "
125835	125842	125844	125844	he	3164	" Can such happiness never return ? "
125869	125915	125916	125916	Ruth	87	" If you would consent , Leonard should be always with you educated where and how you liked money to any amount you might choose to name should be secured to you and him if only , Ruth if only those happy days might return . "
125919	125964	125916	125916	Ruth	87	" I said that I was happy , because I had asked God to protect and help me and I dared not tell a lie . I was happy . Oh ! what is happiness or misery that we should talk about them now ? "
125997	126025	125916	125916	Ruth	87	" I dare not think of happiness I must not look forward to sorrow . God did not put me here to consider either of these things . "
126026	126045	125972	125972	she	87	" My dear Ruth , compose yourself ! There is no hurry in answering the question I asked . "
126046	126051	126053	126053	Ruth	87	" What was it ? "
126055	126145	125972	125972	she	87	" I love you so , I can not live without you . I offer you my heart , my life I offer to place Leonard wherever you would have him placed . I have the power and the means to advance him in any path of life you choose . All who have shown kindness to you shall be rewarded by me , with a gratitude even surpassing your own . If there is anything else I can do that you can suggest , I will do it . "
126146	126151	126153	126153	Ruth	87	" Listen to me ! "
126168	126333	126153	126153	Ruth	87	" When I said that I was happy with you long ago , I was choked with shame as I said it . And yet it may be a vain , false excuse that I make for myself . I was very young ; I did not know how such a life was against God 's pure and holy will at least , not as I know it now ; and I tell you truth all the days of my years since I have gone about with a stain on my hidden soul a stain which made me loathe myself , and envy those who stood spotless and undefiled ; which made me shrink from my child from Mr Benson , from his sister , from the innocent girls whom I teach nay , even I have cowered away from God Himself ; and what I did wrong then , I did blindly to what I should do now if I listened to you . "
126512	126564	126497	126497	he	3167	" Yes , I have much more to say . I have not said half . I can not tell you how fondly I will how fondly I do love you how my life shall be spent in ministering to your wishes . Money , I see I know , you despise "
126565	126594	126600	126600	she	3169	" Mr Bellingham ! I will not stay to hear you speak to me so again . I have been sinful , but it is not you who should "
126644	126647	126649	126649	he	3170	" Ruth ! "
126658	126668	126649	126649	he	3170	" I begin to think you never loved me . "
126669	126684	126691	126691	she	3169	" I ! I never loved you ! Do you dare to say so ? "
126704	126713	126715	126715	he	3170	" Why do you shrink so from me ? "
126723	126737	126739	126739	she	3169	" I did not come here to be spoken to in this way , "
126741	126771	126739	126739	she	3169	" I came , if by any chance I could do Leonard good . I would submit to many humiliations for his sake but to no more from you . "
126772	126782	126784	126784	he	3170	" Are not you afraid to brave me so ? "
126786	126799	126784	126784	he	3170	" Do n't you know how much you are in my power ? "
126883	126891	126893	126893	he	233	" Ask me to let you go , "
126895	126905	126893	126893	he	233	" I will , if you will ask me . "
126945	126949	126951	126951	he	233	" Ask me , "
127006	127012	127014	127014	she	87	" It is Stephen Bromley , "
127016	127041	127014	127014	she	87	" He is coming to his nets . They say he is a very desperate , violent man , but he will protect me . "
127042	127049	127051	127052	Mr Donne	233	" You obstinate , wilful creature ! "
127058	127096	127097	127097	he	233	" You forget that one word of mine could undeceive all these good people at Eccleston ; and that if I spoke out ever so little , they would throw you off in an instant . Now ! "
127100	127112	127097	127097	he	233	" do you understand how much you are in my power ? "
127113	127127	127128	127128	Ruth	87	" Mr and Miss Benson know all they have not thrown me off , "
127132	127147	127128	127128	Ruth	87	" Oh ! for Leonard 's sake ! you would not be so cruel . "
127148	127164	127128	127128	Ruth	87	" Then do not you be cruel to him to me . Think once more ! "
127165	127171	127172	127172	she	87	" I think once more ; "
127176	127323	127172	127172	she	87	" To save Leonard from the shame and agony of knowing my disgrace , I would lie down and die . Oh ! perhaps it would be best for him for me , if I might ; my death would be a stingless grief but to go back into sin would be the real cruelty to him . The errors of my youth may be washed away by my tears it was so once when the gentle , blessed Christ was upon earth ; but now , if I went into wilful guilt , as you would have me , how could I teach Leonard God 's holy will ? I should not mind his knowing my past sin , compared to the awful corruption it would be if he knew me living now , as you would have me , lost to all fear of God "
127331	127373	127374	127374	She	3174	" Whatever may be my doom God is just I leave myself in His hands . I will save Leonard from evil . Evil would it be for him if I lived with you . I will let him die first ! "
127394	127409	127391	127391	she	3174	" You have humbled me enough , sir . I shall leave you now . "
127440	127477	127478	127478	He	233	" What a stately step she has ! How majestic and graceful all her attitudes were ! She thinks she has baffled me now . We will try something more , and bid a higher price . "
127517	127520	127522	127522	he	233	" Ruth ! "
127527	127689	127522	127522	he	233	" You shall hear me once more . Aye , look round ! Your fisherman is near . He may hear me , if he chooses hear your triumph . I am come to offer to marry you , Ruth ; come what may , I will have you . Nay I will make you hear me . I will hold this hand till you have heard me . To - morrow I will speak to any one in Eccleston you like to Mr Bradshaw ; Mr , the little minister , I mean . We can make it worth while for him to keep our secret , and no one else need know but what you are really Mrs Denbigh . Leonard shall still bear this name , but in all things else he shall be treated as my son . He and you would grace any situation . I will take care the highest paths are open to him ! "
127717	127722	127724	127724	she	3177	" I can not , "
127734	127760	127726	127726	her	3177	" It is sudden for you , my dearest . But be calm . It will all be easily managed . Leave it to me . "
127761	127766	127768	127768	she	3177	" I can not , "
127780	127791	127793	127793	he	3176	" Why ! what on earth makes you say that ? "
127808	127975	127726	127726	her	3177	" I do not love you . I did once . Do n't say I did not love you then ; but I do not now . I could never love you again . All you have said and done since you came with Mr Bradshaw to Abermouth first , has only made me wonder how I ever could have loved you . We are very far apart . The time that has pressed down my life like brands of hot iron , and scarred me for ever , has been nothing to you . You have talked of it with no sound of moaning in your voice no shadow over the brightness of your face ; it has left no sense of sin on your conscience , while me it haunts and haunts ; and yet I might plead that I was an ignorant child only I will not plead anything , for God knows all But this is only one piece of our great difference "
127976	127985	127986	127986	he	3178	" You mean that I am no saint , "
127994	128089	127986	127986	he	3178	" Granted . But people who are no saints have made very good husbands before now . Come , do n't let any morbid , overstrained conscientiousness interfere with substantial happiness happiness both to you and to me for I am sure I can make you happy aye ! and make you love me , too , in spite of your pretty defiance . I love you so dearly I must win love back . And here are advantages for Leonard , to be gained by you quite in a holy and legitimate way . "
128095	128226	128090	128090	She	3179	" If there was one thing needed to confirm me , you have named it . You shall have nothing to do with my boy , by my consent , much less by my agency . I would rather see him working on the roadside than leading such a life being such a one as you are . You have heard my mind now , Mr Bellingham . You have humbled me you have baited me ; and if at last I have spoken out too harshly , and too much in a spirit of judgment , the fault is yours . If there were no other reason to prevent our marriage but the one fact that it would bring Leonard into contact with you , that would be enough . "
128227	128232	128234	128234	he	3180	" It is enough ! "
128242	128263	128234	128234	he	3180	" Neither you nor your child shall ever more be annoyed by me . I wish you a good evening . "
128630	128663	128615	128615	She	87	" Oh ! if I had not spoken so angrily to him the last things I said were so bitter so reproachful ! and I shall never , never see him again ! "
128826	128837	128838	128838	she	87	" I am so weary ! I am so weary ! "
128844	128858	128838	128838	she	87	" I wonder if I might stop here , and just die away . "
129476	129481	129469	129469	Ruth	87	" Is he alive ? "
129501	129506	129497	129497	She	87	" How is he ? "
129531	129556	129523	129524	Mr Benson	149	" He is very ill , but we hope he will soon be better . It is what every child has to go through . "
130116	130120	130109	130109	his	149	" our member ; "
130368	130447	130449	130450	the doctor	4409	" it was only a bad kind of measles , and that the lad might have a struggle for it , but he thought he would get through . Vigorous children carried their force into everything ; never did things by halves ; if they were ill , they were sure to be in a high fever directly ; if they were well , there was no peace in the house for their rioting . For his part , "
130452	130481	130449	130450	the doctor	4409	" he thought he was glad he had had no children ; as far as he could judge , they were pretty much all plague and no profit . "
131475	131484	131486	131487	Miss Benson	149	" What were you saying , my darling ? "
131527	131532	131534	131534	Ruth	87	" I only said , "
131538	131556	131534	131534	Ruth	87	" thank God ! I have so much to thank Him for , you do n't know . "
131557	131596	131524	131524	her	87	" My dear , I am sure we have all of us cause to be thankful that our boy is spared . See ! he is wakening up ; and we will have a cup of tea together . "
132170	132175	132169	132169	Ruth	87	" clave unto her , "
134182	134189	134191	134192	her mother	719	" And , Mimie , dear , "
134194	134225	134191	134192	her mother	719	" when you are there , look out for a new bonnet for yourself ; she has got some very pretty ones , and your old one is so shabby . "
134226	134234	134236	134236	Jemima	173	" It does for me , mother , "
134240	134249	134236	134236	Jemima	173	" I do n't want a new bonnet . "
134250	134272	134191	134192	her mother	719	" But I want you to have one , my lassie . I want my girl to look well and nice . "
134323	134332	134334	134334	Jemima	173	" I think you love me , mother , "
134336	134394	134429	134429	acquaintances	3356	" We all love you , dear , if you would but think so . And if you want anything , or wish for anything , only tell me , and with a little patience I can get your father to give it you , I know . Only be happy , there 's a good girl . "
134395	134409	134411	134411	Jemima	173	" Be happy ! as if one could by an effort of will ! "
134588	134629	134560	134560	She	244	" Here are some bonnets , ma'am , that will be just the thing for you elegant and tasty , yet quite of the simple style , suitable to young ladies . Oblige me by trying on this white silk ! "
134675	134681	134668	134669	Mrs Pearson	244	" rich , beautiful hair , "
134684	134687	134689	134690	the wearer	3365	" Oriental eyes "
134692	134713	134668	134669	Mrs Pearson	244	" I induced the young lady who accompanied your sisters the other day the governess , is she , ma'am ? "
134714	134722	134724	134724	Jemima	173	" Yes Mrs Denbigh is her name , "
134729	134775	134668	134669	Mrs Pearson	244	" Thank you , ma'am . Well , I persuaded Mrs Denbigh to try on that bonnet , and you ca n't think how charming she looked in it ; and yet I do n't think it became her as much as it does you . "
134776	134783	134785	134785	Jemima	173	" Mrs Denbigh is very beautiful , "
134802	134850	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" Very , ma'am . Quite a peculiar style of beauty . If I might be allowed , I should say that hers was a Grecian style of loveliness , while yours was Oriental . She reminded me of a young person I once knew in Fordham . "
134858	134862	134864	134864	Jemima	173	" In Fordham ! "
134902	134917	134898	134898	Ruth	87	" In Fordham ! Why , I think Mrs Denbigh comes from that neighbourhood . "
134918	134998	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" Oh , ma'am ! she can not be the young person I mean I am sure , ma'am holding the position she does in your establishment . I should hardly say I knew her myself ; for I only saw her two or three times at my sister 's house ; but she was so remarked for her beauty , that I remember her face quite well the more so , on account of her vicious conduct afterwards . "
134999	135004	135006	135006	Jemima	173	" Her vicious conduct ! "
135022	135025	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" young person "
135029	135040	135021	135024	the " young person	5913	" Then it could not have been our Mrs Denbigh . "
135041	135098	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" Oh , no , ma'am ! I am sure I should be sorry to be understood to have suggested anything of the kind . I beg your pardon if I did so . All I meant to say and perhaps that was a liberty I ought not to have taken , considering what Ruth Hilton was "
135099	135103	135105	135105	Jemima	173	" Ruth Hilton ! "
135116	135133	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" Yes , ma'am , that was the name of the young person I allude to . "
135134	135144	135146	135146	Jemima	173	" Tell me about her what did she do ? "
135171	135281	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" I do n't know whether I ought to tell you , ma'am it is hardly a fit story for a young lady ; but this Ruth Hilton was an apprentice to my sister - in - law , who had a first - rate business in Fordham , which brought her a good deal of patronage from the county families ; and this young creature was very artful and bold , and thought sadly too much of her beauty ; and , somehow , she beguiled a young gentleman , who took her into keeping I am sure , ma'am , I ought to apologise for polluting your ears "
135282	135286	135288	135288	Jemima	173	" Go on , "
135292	135398	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" I do n't know much more . His mother followed him into Wales . She was a lady of a great deal of religion , and of a very old family , and was much shocked at her son 's misfortune in being captivated by such a person ; but she led him to repentance , and took him to Paris , where , I think , she died ; but I am not sure , for , owing to family differences , I have not been on terms for some years with my sister - in - law , who was my informant . "
135399	135403	135405	135405	Jemima	173	" Who died ? "
135406	135418	135405	135405	Jemima	173	" the young man 's mother , or or Ruth Hilton ? "
135419	135453	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" Oh dear , ma'am ! pray do n't confuse the two . It was the mother , Mrs I forget the name something like Billington . It was the lady who died . "
135454	135462	135464	135464	Jemima	173	" And what became of the other ? "
135480	135541	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" The girl ? Why , ma'am , what could become of her ? Not that I know exactly only one knows they can but go from bad to worse , poor creatures ! God forgive me , if I am speaking too transiently of such degraded women , who , after all , are a disgrace to our sex . "
135542	135551	135553	135553	Jemima	173	" Then you know nothing more about her ? "
135555	135586	134851	134852	Mrs Pearson	244	" I did hear that she had gone off with another gentleman that she met with in Wales , but I 'm sure I ca n't tell who told me . "
135658	135675	135676	135676	Leonard	110	" How long is it since all this all you have been telling me about happened ? "
135682	135735	135737	135737	she	173	" Why let me see . It was before I was married , and I was married three years , and poor dear Pearson has been deceased five I should say going on for nine years this summer . Blush roses would become your complexion , perhaps , better than these lilacs , "
135765	135792	135804	135804	she	173	" Thank you . It is very pretty . But I do n't want a bonnet . I beg your pardon for taking up your time . "
135851	135858	135860	135860	she	173	" I have changed my mind , "
135875	135887	135860	135860	she	173	" I will take the bonnet . How much is it ? "
135888	135928	135930	135931	Mrs Pearson	244	" Allow me to change the flowers ; it can be done in an instant , and then you can see if you would not prefer the roses ; but with either foliage it is a lovely little bonnet , "
135941	135955	135957	135957	she	173	" Oh ! never mind the flowers yes ! change them to roses . "
135983	135988	135990	135990	Jemima	173	" By the way , "
136019	136046	135993	135993	she	173	" Papa , I am sure , would not like your connecting Mrs Denbigh 's name with such a story as you have been telling me . "
136047	136094	135993	135993	she	173	" Oh dear ! ma'am , I have too much respect for you all to think of doing such a thing ! Of course I know , ma'am , that it is not to be cast up to any lady that she is like anybody disreputable . "
136095	136110	136112	136112	Jemima	173	" But I would rather you did not name the likeness to any one , "
136114	136134	136112	136112	Jemima	173	" not to any one . Do n't tell any one the story you have told me this morning . "
136135	136171	135993	135993	she	173	" Indeed , ma'am , I should never think of such a thing ! My poor husband could have borne witness that I am as close as the grave where there is anything to conceal . "
136172	136176	136178	136178	Jemima	173	" Oh dear ! "
136180	136198	136178	136178	Jemima	173	" Mrs Pearson , there is nothing to conceal ; only you must not speak about it . "
136199	136216	135993	135993	she	173	" I certainly shall not do it , ma'am ; you may rest assured of me . "
137661	137672	137674	137674	she	173	" Quiet , mother ! quiet , dear , dear mother "
137690	137697	137674	137674	she	173	" that is all I want . "
138765	138812	138743	138743	he	156	" I wish Farquhar were at home . Though he is such a stiff , quiet old fellow , his coming in in the evenings makes a change . What has become of the Millses ? They used to drink tea with us sometimes , formerly . "
138813	138844	138918	138918	Jemima	173	" Oh ! papa and Mr Mills took opposite sides at the election , and we have never visited since . I do n't think they are any great loss . "
138845	138869	138743	138743	he	156	" Anybody is a loss the stupidest bore that ever was would be a blessing , if he only would come in sometimes . "
138870	138884	138918	138918	Jemima	173	" Mr and Miss Benson have drank tea here twice since you came . "
138885	138917	138743	138743	he	156	" Come , that 's capital ! Apropos of stupid bores , you talk of the Bensons . I did not think you had so much discrimination , my little sister . "
138929	138952	138918	138918	Jemima	173	" I never meant to say a word against Mr or Miss Benson , and that you know quite well , Dick . "
138953	138993	138918	138918	Jemima	173	" Never mind ! I wo n't tell tales . They are stupid old fogeys , but they are better than nobody , especially as that handsome governess of the girls always comes with them to be looked at . "
139006	139030	139000	139000	Richard	156	" Do you know , Mimie , I 've a notion , if she plays her cards well , she may hook Farquhar ! "
139031	139034	139036	139036	Jemima	173	" Who ? "
139046	139107	138743	138743	he	156	" Mrs Denbigh , to be sure . We were talking of her , you know . Farquhar asked me to dine with him at his hotel as he passed through town , and I 'd my own reasons for going and trying to creep up his sleeve I wanted him to tip me , as he used to do . "
139108	139114	139117	139117	Jemima	173	" For shame ! Dick , "
139119	139143	138743	138743	he	156	" Well ! well ! not tip me exactly , but lend me some money . The governor keeps me so deucedly short . "
139144	139180	138743	138743	he	156	" Why ! it was only yesterday , when my father was speaking about your expenses , and your allowance , I heard you say that you 'd more than you knew how to spend . "
139181	139266	138743	138743	he	156	" Do n't you see that was the perfection of art ? If my father had thought me extravagant , he would have kept me in with a tight rein ; as it is , I 'm in great hopes of a handsome addition , and I can tell you it 's needed . If my father had given me what I ought to have had at first , I should not have been driven to the speculations and messes I 've got into . "
139267	139274	139276	139276	Jemima	173	" What speculations ? What messes ? "
139282	139316	139317	139317	He	3440	" Oh ! messes was not the right word . Speculations hardly was ; for they are sure to turn out well , and then I shall surprise my father with my riches . "
139338	139352	138743	138743	he	156	" But , what do you mean ? Do explain it to me . "
139353	139483	138743	138743	he	156	" Never you trouble your head about my business , my dear . Women ca n't understand the share - market , and such things . Do n't think I 've forgotten the awful blunders you made when you tried to read the state of the money - market aloud to my father , that night when he had lost his spectacles . What were we talking of ? Oh ! of Farquhar and pretty Mrs Denbigh . Yes ! I soon found out that was the subject my gentleman liked me to dwell on . He did not talk about her much himself , but his eyes sparkled when I told him what enthusiastic letters Polly and Elizabeth wrote about her . How old d'ye think she is ? "
139484	139488	139490	139490	Jemima	173	" I know ! "
139492	139523	139490	139490	Jemima	173	" At least , I heard her age spoken about , amongst other things , when first she came . She will be five - and - twenty this autumn . "
139524	139592	138743	138743	he	156	" And Farquhar is forty , if he is a day . She 's young , too , to have such a boy as Leonard ; younger - looking , or full as young - looking as she is ! I tell you what , Mimie , she looks younger than you . How old are you ? Three - and - twenty , ai n't it ? "
139593	139597	139599	139599	Jemima	173	" Last March , "
139601	139790	138743	138743	he	156	" You 'll have to make haste and pick up somebody , if you 're losing your good looks at this rate . Why , Jemima , I thought you had a good chance of Farquhar a year or two ago . How come you to have lost him ? I 'd far rather you 'd had him than that proud , haughty Mrs Denbigh , who flashes her great grey eyes upon me if ever I dare to pay her a compliment . She ought to think it an honour that I take that much notice of her . Besides , Farquhar is rich , and it 's keeping the business of the firm in one 's own family ; and if he marries Mrs Denbigh she will be sure to be wanting Leonard in when he 's of age , and I wo n't have that . Have a try for Farquhar , Mimie ! Ten to one it 's not too late . I wish I 'd brought you a pink bonnet down . You go about so dowdy so careless of how you look . "
139791	139803	139805	139805	Jemima	173	" If Mr Farquhar has not liked me as I am , "
139809	139822	139805	139805	Jemima	173	" I do n't want to owe him to a pink bonnet . "
139823	140030	138743	138743	he	156	" Nonsense ! I do n't like to have my sisters ' governess stealing a march on my sister . I tell you Farquhar is worth trying for . If you 'll wear the pink bonnet I 'll give it you , and I 'll back you against Mrs Denbigh . I think you might have done something with ' our member , ' as my father calls him , when you had him so long in the house . But , altogether , I should like Farquhar best for a brother - in - law . By the way , have you heard down here that Donne is going to be married ? I heard of it in town , just before I left , from a man that was good authority . Some Sir Thomas Campbell 's seventh daughter : a girl without a penny ; father ruined himself by gambling , and obliged to live abroad . But Donne is not a man to care for any obstacle , from all accounts , when once he has taken a fancy . It was love at first sight , they say . I believe he did not know of her existence a month ago . "
140031	140041	140043	140043	Jemima	173	" No ! we have not heard of it , "
140045	140057	140059	140059	she	173	" My father will like to know ; tell it him ; "
140132	140137	140139	140139	Dick	224	" Look ! look ! "
140144	140227	140139	140139	Dick	224	" I wanted to make sure of his coming in to - night , to save me my father 's parting exhortations against the temptations of the world as if I did not know much more of the world than he does ! , so I used a spell I thought would prove efficacious ; I told him that we should be by ourselves , with the exception of Mrs Denbigh , and look how he is expecting her to come in ! "
140540	140578	140717	140717	Jemima	173	" What , you are here , are you ? I have been looking everywhere for you . I wanted to ask you if you have any spare money you could lend me for a few weeks ? "
140579	140586	140588	140588	Jemima	173	" How much do you want ? "
140597	140621	140717	140717	Jemima	173	" Oh ! the more the better . But I should be glad of any trifle , I am kept so confoundedly short . "
140654	140713	140631	140635	her careless , selfish brother	3455	" Come , Mimie , do n't give it up . If I were you , I would have a good try against Mrs Denbigh . I 'll send you the bonnet as soon as ever I get back to town , and you pluck up a spirit , and I 'll back you against her even yet . "
140919	140925	140927	140927	Jemima	173	" Oh ! merciful God , "
140937	141045	140927	140927	Jemima	173	" the strain is too great I can not bear it longer my life my love the very essence of me , which is myself through time and eternity ; and on the other side there is all - pitying Charity . If she had not been what she is if she had shown any sign of triumph any knowledge of her prize if she had made any effort to gain his dear heart , I must have given way long ago , and taunted her , even if I did not tell others taunted her , even though I sank down to the pit the next moment .
141046	141105	140927	140927	Jemima	173	" The temptation is too strong for me . Oh Lord ! where is Thy peace that I believed in , in my childhood ? that I hear people speaking of now , as if it hushed up the troubles of life , and had not to be sought for sought for , as with tears of blood ! "
141678	141681	141682	141682	Ruth	87	" Delectus . "
141685	141700	141682	141682	Ruth	87	" Now , do let us try to be very steady this next hour , "
141980	142005	142006	142006	He	156	" Mary and Elizabeth , leave the room . Do n't stay to pack up your books . Leave the room , I say ! "
142073	142080	142082	142082	he	156	" Leave the room , Jemima , "
142084	142089	142091	142091	she	173	" Why , father ? "
142341	142444	142445	142445	He	3500	" If there be one sin I hate I utterly loathe more than all others , it is wantonness . It includes all other sins . It is but of a piece that you should have come with your sickly , hypocritical face , imposing upon us all . I trust Benson did not know of it for his own sake , I trust not . Before God , if he got you into my house on false pretences , he shall find his charity at other men 's expense shall cost him dear you the common talk of Eccleston for your profligacy "
142513	142519	142490	142490	she	87	" I was so young . "
142520	142530	142531	142532	Mr Bradshaw	156	" The more depraved , the more disgusting you , "
142571	142574	142564	142564	Jemima	173	" Father ! "
142575	142625	142490	142490	she	87	" You hold your tongue , Jemima . You have grown more and more insolent more and more disobedient every day . I now know who to thank for it . When such a woman came into my family there is no wonder at any corruption any evil any defilement "
142626	142629	142564	142564	Jemima	173	" Father ! "
142630	142687	142689	142689	Ruth	87	" Not a word ! If , in your disobedience , you choose to stay and hear what no modest young woman would put herself in the way of hearing , you shall be silent when I bid you . The only good you can gain is in the way of warning . Look at that woman "
142722	142773	142774	142774	He	3502	" look at that woman , I say corrupt long before she was your age hypocrite for years ! If ever you , or any child of mine , cared for her , shake her off from you , as St Paul shook off the viper even into the fire . "
142844	142911	142832	142832	she	87	" Father , I will speak . I will not keep silence . I will bear witness to Ruth . I have hated her so keenly , may God forgive me ! but you may know , from that , that my witness is true . I have hated her , and my hatred was only quenched into contempt not contempt now , dear Ruth dear Ruth "
142933	143068	143069	143069	Her	3505	" I heard what you have learnt now , father , weeks and weeks ago a year it may be , all time of late has been so long ; and I shuddered up from her and from her sin ; and I might have spoken of it , and told it there and then , if I had not been afraid that it was from no good motive I should act in so doing , but to gain a way to the desire of my own jealous heart . Yes , father , to show you what a witness I am for Ruth , I will own that I was stabbed to the heart with jealousy ; some one some one cared for Ruth that oh , father ! spare me saying all . "
143088	143207	143080	143080	she	3505	" I watched her , and I watched her with my wild - beast eyes . If I had seen one paltering with duty if I had witnessed one flickering shadow of untruth in word or action if , more than all things , my woman 's instinct had ever been conscious of the faintest speck of impurity in thought , or word , or look , my old hate would have flamed out with the flame of hell ! my contempt would have turned to loathing disgust , instead of my being full of pity , and the stirrings of new - awakened love , and most true respect . Father , I have borne my witness ! "
143208	143221	143223	143224	her father	417	" And I will tell you how much your witness is worth , "
143242	143358	143223	143224	her father	417	" It only convinces me more and more how deep is the corruption this wanton has spread in my family . She has come amongst us with her innocent seeming , and spread her nets well and skilfully . She has turned right into wrong , and wrong into right , and taught you all to be uncertain whether there be any such thing as Vice in the world , or whether it ought not to be looked upon as Virtue . She has led you to the brink of the deep pit , ready for the first chance circumstance to push you in . And I trusted her I trusted her I welcomed her . "
143359	143366	143368	143368	Ruth	87	" I have done very wrong , "
143391	143410	143383	143383	he	3507	" I welcomed her . I was duped into allowing her bastard I sicken at the thought of it "
143532	143555	143527	143528	Mr Bradshaw	156	" That very child and heir of shame to associate with my own innocent children ! I trust they are not contaminated . "
143556	143568	143575	143575	Ruth	87	" I can not bear it I can not bear it ! "
143577	143588	143589	143589	he	156	" Can not bear it ! can not bear it ! "
143592	143753	143589	143589	he	156	" You must bear it , madam . Do you suppose your child is to be exempt from the penalties of his birth ? Do you suppose that he alone is to be saved from the upbraiding scoff ? Do you suppose that he is ever to rank with other boys , who are not stained and marked with sin from their birth ? Every creature in Eccleston may know what he is ; do you think they will spare him their scorn ? ' Can not bear it , ' indeed ! Before you went into your sin , you should have thought whether you could bear the consequences or not have had some idea how far your offspring would be degraded and scouted , till the best thing that could happen to him would be for him to be lost to all sense of shame , dead to all knowledge of guilt , for his mother 's sake . "
143771	143848	143758	143758	She	87	" I appeal to God against such a doom for my child . I appeal to God to help me . I am a mother , and as such I cry to God for help for help to keep my boy in His pitying sight , and to bring him up in His holy fear . Let the shame fall on me ! I have deserved it , but he he is so innocent and good . "
144033	144058	144017	144017	He	110	" If ever you , or your bastard , darken this door again , I will have you both turned out by the police ! "
144397	144400	144389	144389	she	87	" Upstairs , "
144557	144586	144537	144537	She	87	" My poor , poor boy ! my poor , poor darling ! Oh ! would that I had died I had died , in my innocent girlhood ! "
144587	144592	144594	144594	Leonard	110	" Mother ! mother ! "
144596	144662	144594	144594	Leonard	110	" What is the matter ? Why do you look so wild and ill ? Why do you call me your ' poor boy ' ? Are we not going to Scaurside - hill ? I do n't much mind it , mother ; only please do n't gasp and quiver so . Dearest mother , are you ill ? Let me call Aunt Faith ! "
144691	144697	144699	144699	she	87	" Kiss me , Leonard ! "
144700	144714	144715	144715	Leonard	110	" kiss me , my darling , once more in the old way ! "
144743	144746	144748	144748	she	87	" Leonard ! "
144770	144775	144776	144777	The boy	4407	" listen to me . "
144910	144950	144951	144951	she	87	" Leonard when I was very young I did very wrong . I think God , who knows all , will judge me more tenderly than men but I did wrong in a way which you can not understand yet "
144980	145055	145057	145057	she	87	" in a way people never forget , never forgive . You will hear me called the hardest names that ever can be thrown at women I have been , to - day ; and , my child , you must bear it patiently , because they will be partly true . Never get confused , by your love for me , into thinking that what I did was right . Where was I ? "
145110	145115	145117	145117	she	87	" And , Leonard , "
145126	145200	145117	145117	she	87	" this is not all . The punishment of punishments lies awaiting me still . It is to see you suffer for my wrongdoing . Yes , darling ! they will speak shameful things of you , poor innocent child ! as well as of me , who am guilty . They will throw it in your teeth through life , that your mother was never married was not married when you were born "
145201	145213	145215	145215	he	3524	" Were not you married ? Are not you a widow ? "
145236	145248	145250	145250	she	3525	" No ! May God forgive me , and help me ! "
145337	145368	145332	145332	she	3525	" Oh , would to God I had died that I had died as a baby that I had died as a little baby hanging at my mother 's breast ! "
145369	145372	145374	145374	Leonard	110	" Mother , "
145398	145401	145403	145403	he	110	" Mother , "
145417	145421	145423	145423	he	110	" mammy darling , "
145442	145477	145423	145423	he	110	" mammy , my own , own dear , dear , darling mother , I do n't believe them I do n't , I do n't , I do n't , I do n't ! "
145516	145552	145554	145554	she	3525	" Hush , Leonard ! Leonard , be still , my child ! I have been too sudden with you ! I have done you harm oh ! I have done you nothing but harm , "
145565	145570	145572	145572	he	110	" No , mother , "
145586	145630	145631	145631	He	110	" there never was such a mother as you have been to me , and I wo n't believe any one who says it . I wo n't ; and I 'll knock them down if they say it again , I will ! "
145646	145653	145655	145655	Ruth	87	" You forget , my child , "
145668	145683	145655	145655	Ruth	87	" I said it of myself ; I said it because it was true . "
145719	145729	145710	145710	She	87	" Oh , that she and he lay dead ! "
145780	145783	145785	145785	she	87	" Leonard , "
145787	145800	145785	145785	she	87	" Leonard , look up at me ! Leonard , look up ! "
145815	145819	145821	145821	she	87	" My boy ! "
145823	145894	145821	145821	she	87	" what can I do or say ? If I tell you never to mind it that it is nothing I tell you false . It is a bitter shame and a sorrow that I have drawn down upon you . A shame , Leonard , because of me , your mother ; but , Leonard , it is no disgrace or lowering of you in the eyes of God . "
145916	145988	145900	145900	she	87	" Remember that , always . Remember that , when the time of trial comes and it seems a hard and cruel thing that you should be called reproachful names by men , and all for what was no fault of yours remember God 's pity and God 's justice ; and though my sin shall have made you an outcast in the world oh , my child , my child ! "
146009	146032	145991	145991	him	110	" remember , darling of my heart , it is only your own sin that can make you an outcast from God . "
146183	146189	146191	146191	she	87	" Go to Aunt Faith ! "
146193	146202	146191	146191	she	87	" I am weary , and want sleep . "
146267	146277	146252	146252	He	2050	" Mother will they speak to me about it ? "
146337	146340	146341	146341	she	87	" No , "
146344	146353	146341	146341	she	87	" You may be sure they will not . "
146869	146875	146877	146877	he	3553	" Sit down , sir ! "
146954	147017	146951	146951	he	3553	" Mr Benson , I have sent for you to ask I am almost too indignant at the bare suspicion to speak as becomes me but did you I really shall be obliged to beg your pardon , if you are as much in the dark as I was yesterday as to the character of that woman who lives under your roof ? "
147098	147104	147107	147107	his	156	" Hear me , sir ! "
147119	147169	147107	147107	his	156	" Nothing you can say , can upbraid me like my own conscience ; no degradation you can inflict , by word or deed , can come up to the degradation I have suffered for years , at being a party to a deceit , even for a good end "
147170	147181	147107	147107	his	156	" For a good end ! Nay ! what next ? "
147228	147381	147216	147216	his	149	" For a good end . The end was not , as perhaps you consider it to have been , to obtain her admission into your family nor yet to put her in the way of gaining her livelihood ; my sister and I would willingly have shared what we have with her ; it was our intention to do so at first , if not for any length of time , at least as long as her health might require it . Why I advised perhaps I only yielded to advice a change of name an assumption of a false state of widowhood was because I earnestly desired to place her in circumstances in which she might work out her self - redemption ; and you , sir , know how terribly the world goes against all such as have sinned as Ruth did . She was so young , too . "
147382	147511	147513	147514	Mr Bradshaw	156	" You mistake , sir ; my acquaintance has not lain so much among that class of sinners as to give me much experience of the way in which they are treated . But , judging from what I have seen , I should say they meet with full as much leniency as they deserve ; and supposing they do not I know there are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just now who reserve all their interest and regard for criminals why not pick out one of these to help you in your task of washing the blackamoor white ? Why choose me to be imposed upon my household into which to intrude your protťgťe ? Why were my innocent children to be exposed to corruption ? I say , "
147520	147587	147513	147514	Mr Bradshaw	156	" how dared you come into this house , where you were looked upon as a minister of religion , with a lie in your mouth ? How dared you single me out , of all people , to be gulled and deceived , and pointed at through the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman into his house to teach his daughters ? "
147588	147598	147216	147216	his	149	" I own my deceit was wrong and faithless . "
147599	147623	147513	147514	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Yes ! you can own it , now it is found out ! There is small merit in that , I think ! "
147624	147661	147216	147216	his	149	" Sir ! I claim no merit . I take shame to myself . I did not single you out . You applied to me with your proposal that Ruth should be your children 's governess . "
147662	147665	147513	147514	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Pah ! "
147666	147699	147216	147216	his	149	" And the temptation was too great No ! I will not say that but the temptation was greater than I could stand it seemed to open out a path of usefulness . "
147700	147712	147714	147715	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Now , do n't let me hear you speak so , "
147720	147748	147714	147715	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I ca n't stand it . It is too much to talk in that way when the usefulness was to consist in contaminating my innocent girls . "
147749	147793	147795	147796	Mr Benson	149	" God knows that if I had believed there had been any danger of such contamination God knows how I would have died sooner than have allowed her to enter your family . Mr Bradshaw , you believe me , do n't you ? "
147800	147816	147818	147819	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in future , "
147828	147834	147835	147836	Mr Benson	149	" I have deserved this , "
147839	147842	147844	147844	he	149	" But , "
147852	148003	147844	147844	he	149	" I will not speak of myself , but of Ruth . Surely , sir , the end I aimed at the means I took to obtain it were wrong ; you can not feel that more than I do was a right one ; and you will not you can not say , that your children have suffered from associating with her . I had her in my family , under the watchful eyes of three anxious persons for a year or more ; we saw faults no human being is without them and poor Ruth 's were but slight venial errors ; but we saw no sign of a corrupt mind no glimpse of boldness or forwardness no token of want of conscientiousness ; she seemed , and was , a young and gentle girl , who had been led astray before she fairly knew what life was . "
148004	148017	148019	148020	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time , "
148026	148061	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" Oh , Mr Bradshaw ! Ruth was not depraved , and you know it . You can not have seen her have known her daily , all these years , without acknowledging that ! "
148090	148135	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" I saw her daily I did not know her . If I had known her , I should have known she was fallen and depraved , and consequently not fit to come into my house , nor to associate with my pure children . "
148136	148225	148226	148227	Mr Benson	149	" Now I wish God would give me power to speak out convincingly what I believe to be His truth , that not every woman who has fallen is depraved ; that many how many the Great Judgment Day will reveal to those who have shaken off the poor , sore , penitent hearts on earth many , many crave and hunger after a chance for virtue the help which no man gives to them help that gentle , tender help which Jesus gave once to Mary Magdalen . "
148236	148320	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" Come , come , Mr Benson , let us have no more of this morbid way of talking . The world has decided how such women are to be treated ; and , you may depend upon it , there is so much practical wisdom in the world that its way of acting is right in the long run , and that no one can fly in its face with impunity , unless , indeed , they stoop to deceit and imposition . "
148321	148332	148334	148335	Mr Benson	149	" I take my stand with Christ against the world , "
148346	148365	148334	148335	Mr Benson	149	" What have the world 's ways ended in ? Can we be much worse than we are ? "
148366	148375	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" Speak for yourself , if you please . "
148376	148455	148334	148335	Mr Benson	149	" Is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting ? I declare before God , that if I believe in any one human truth , it is this that to every woman who , like Ruth , has sinned , should be given a chance of self - redemption and that such a chance should be given in no supercilious or contemptuous manner , but in the spirit of the holy Christ . "
148456	148470	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" Such as getting her into a friend 's house under false colours . "
148471	148583	148334	148335	Mr Benson	149	" I do not argue on Ruth 's case . In that I have acknowledged my error . I do not argue on any case . I state my firm belief , that it is God 's will that we should not dare to trample any of His creatures down to the hopeless dust ; that it is God 's will that the women who have fallen should be numbered among those who have broken hearts to be bound up , not cast aside as lost beyond recall . If this be God 's will , as a thing of God it will stand ; and He will open a way . "
148584	148676	148062	148063	Mr Benson	149	" I should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation on this point if I could have respected your conduct in other matters . As it is , when I see a man who has deluded himself into considering falsehood right , I am disinclined to take his opinion on subjects connected with morality ; and I can no longer regard him as a fitting exponent of the will of God . You perhaps understand what I mean , Mr Benson . I can no longer attend your chapel . "
149015	149018	149020	149020	he	149	" Ruth ! "
149040	149046	149048	149048	he	149	" Where are you going ? "
149109	149118	149098	149098	she	87	" To Helmsby I am going to Helmsby . "
149119	149132	149140	149140	she	87	" Helmsby ! my poor girl may God have mercy upon you ! "
149144	149149	149136	149136	she	87	" Where is Helmsby ? "
149150	149162	149098	149098	she	87	" I do n't know . In Lincolnshire , I think . "
149163	149171	149136	149136	she	87	" But why are you going there ? "
149172	149179	149181	149181	she	87	" Hush ! he 's asleep , "
149192	149197	149199	149200	Mr Benson	149	" Who is asleep ? "
149202	149208	149210	149210	she	87	" That poor little boy , "
149218	149222	149224	149224	he	149	" Come here ! "
149234	149247	149248	149248	He	149	" Sit down in that chair . I will come back directly . "
149279	149288	149290	149290	he	149	" How long has Ruth been at home ? "
149292	149323	149248	149248	He	149	" Ruth ! She has never been at home sin ' morning . She and Leonard were to be off for the day somewhere or other with them Bradshaw girls . "
149324	149332	149402	149402	She	3568	" Then she has had no dinner ? "
149333	149355	149248	149248	He	149	" Not here , at any rate . I ca n't answer for what she may have done at other places . "
149356	149363	149402	149402	She	3568	" And Leonard where is he ? "
149364	149401	149248	149248	He	149	" How should I know ? With his mother , I suppose . Leastways , that was what was fixed on . I 've enough to do of my own , without routing after other folks . "
149420	149423	149424	149424	he	149	" Sally , "
149427	149460	149424	149424	he	149	" I want a cup of tea . Will you make it as soon as you can ; and some dry toast too ? I 'll come for it in ten minutes . "
149478	149540	149468	149468	she	3568	" What ha ' ye been doing to yourself , to look so grim and grey ? Tiring yourself all to tatters , looking after some naught , I 'll be bound ! Well ! well ! I mun make ye your tea , I reckon ; but I did hope as you grew older you 'd ha ' grown wiser ! "
149639	149651	149653	149654	Mr Benson	149	" Poor child ! This was what she meant , then , "
149656	149667	149668	149668	he	149	" He has begun his share of the sorrows too , "
149673	149685	149668	149668	he	149	" No ! I will not waken him back to consciousness . "
149721	149727	149728	149728	she	87	" I must be going , "
149736	149765	149717	149717	she	87	" Nay , Ruth , you must not go . You must not leave us . We can not do without you . We love you too much . "
149766	149770	149772	149772	she	87	" Love me ! "
149805	149865	149780	149780	she	87	" Yes ! Ruth . You know we do . You may have other things to fill up your mind just now , but you know we love you ; and nothing can alter our love for you . You ought not to have thought of leaving us . You would not , if you had been quite well . "
149866	149874	149875	149875	she	87	" Do you know what has happened ? "
149885	149892	149893	149893	he	149	" Yes . I know all , "
149896	149908	149893	149893	he	149	" It makes no difference to us . Why should it ? "
149909	149925	149926	149926	she	87	" Oh ! Mr Benson , do n't you know that my shame is discovered ? "
149932	149952	149893	149893	he	149	" and I must leave you , and leave Leonard , that you may not share in my disgrace . "
149953	149978	149893	149893	he	149	" You must do no such thing . Leave Leonard ! You have no right to leave Leonard . Where could you go to ? "
149979	149983	149984	149984	she	87	" To Helmsby , "
149989	150014	149984	149984	she	87	" It would break my heart to go , but I think I ought , for Leonard 's sake . I know I ought . "
150036	150051	150024	150025	Mr Benson	149	" It will break my heart to go , but I know I must . "
150052	150059	150061	150061	he	149	" Sit still here at present , "
150094	150098	150099	150099	He	149	" Drink this ! "
150116	150121	150122	150122	She	87	" Eat some toast . "
150155	150160	150162	150162	she	87	" I can not , "
150214	150247	150207	150208	Mr Benson	149	" Now , Ruth , we must talk a little together . I want to understand what your plan was . Where is Helmsby ? Why did you fix to go there ? "
150248	150256	150257	150257	she	87	" It is where my mother lived , "
150260	150306	150308	150308	she	87	" Before she was married she lived there ; and wherever she lived , the people all loved her dearly ; and I thought I think , that for her sake some one would give me work . I meant to tell them the truth , "
150314	150341	150343	150343	she	87	" but still they would , perhaps , give me some employment I do n't care what for her sake . I could do many things , "
150349	150399	150400	150400	she	87	" I am sure I could weed I could in gardens if they did not like to have me in their houses . But perhaps some one , for my mother 's sake oh ! my dear , dear mother ! do you know where and what I am ? "
150424	150513	150677	150677	he	3576	" Ruth ! you must be still and quiet . I can not have this . I want you to listen to me . Your thought of Helmsby would be a good one , if it was right for you to leave Eccleston ; but I do not think it is . I am certain of this , that it would be a great sin in you to separate yourself from Leonard . You have no right to sever the tie by which God has bound you together . "
150514	150540	150677	150677	he	3576	" But if I am here they will all know and remember the shame of his birth ; and if I go away they may forget "
150541	150673	150677	150677	he	3576	" And they may not . And if you go away , he may be unhappy or ill ; and you , who above all others have and have from God remember that , Ruth ! the power to comfort him , the tender patience to nurse him , have left him to the care of strangers . Yes ; I know ! But we ourselves are as strangers , dearly as we love him , compared to a mother . He may turn to sin , and want the long forbearance , the serene authority of a parent ; and where are you ? No dread of shame , either for yourself , or even for him , can ever make it right for you to shake off your responsibility . "
150699	150704	150705	150705	he	3576	" Besides , Ruth , "
150708	150840	150842	150842	he	3578	" we have gone on falsely hitherto . It has been my doing , my mistake , my sin . I ought to have known better . Now , let us stand firm on the truth . You have no new fault to repent of . Be brave and faithful . It is to God you answer , not to men . The shame of having your sin known to the world , should be as nothing to the shame you felt at having sinned . We have dreaded men too much , and God too little , in the course we have taken . But now be of good cheer . Perhaps you will have to find your work in the world very low not quite working in the fields , "
150862	150869	150870	150870	he	3578	" Nay , perhaps , Ruth , "
150874	151031	150870	150870	he	3578	" you may have to stand and wait for some time ; no one may be willing to use the services you would gladly render ; all may turn aside from you , and may speak very harshly of you . Can you accept all this treatment meekly , as but the reasonable and just penance God has laid upon you feeling no anger against those who slight you , no impatience for the time to come and come it surely will I speak as having the word of God for what I say when He , having purified you , even as by fire , will make a straight path for your feet ? My child , it is Christ the Lord who has told us of this infinite mercy of God . Have you faith enough in it to be brave , and bear on , and do rightly in patience and in tribulation ? "
151054	151057	151059	151059	she	87	" Yes ! "
151061	151083	151059	151059	she	87	" I hope I believe I can be faithful for myself , for I have sinned and done wrong . But Leonard "
151090	151094	151095	151095	he	3580	" But Leonard , "
151098	151121	151095	151095	he	3580	" Ah ! there it is hard , Ruth . I own the world is hard and persecuting to such as he . "
151138	151307	151309	151309	he	3581	" The world is not everything , Ruth ; nor is the want of men 's good opinion and esteem the highest need which man has . Teach Leonard this . You would not wish his life to be one summer 's day . You dared not make it so , if you had the power . Teach him to bid a noble , Christian welcome to the trials which God sends and this is one of them . Teach him not to look on a life of struggle , and perhaps of disappointment and incompleteness , as a sad and mournful end , but as the means permitted to the heroes and warriors in the army of Christ , by which to show their faithful following . Tell him of the hard and thorny path which was trodden once by the bleeding feet of One . Ruth ! think of the Saviour 's life and cruel death , and of His divine faithfulness . Oh , Ruth ! "
151311	151358	151359	151359	he	3581	" when I look and see what you may be what you must be to that boy , I can not think how you could be coward enough , for a moment , to shrink from your work ! But we have all been cowards hitherto , "
151368	151378	151359	151359	he	3581	" God help us to be so no longer ! "
151405	151409	151411	151411	she	87	" Mr Benson ! "
151432	151452	151453	151453	she	87	" I mean to try very , very hard , to do my duty to Leonard and to God , "
151458	151470	151453	151453	she	87	" I am only afraid my faith may sometimes fail about Leonard "
151471	151492	151453	151453	she	87	" Ask , and it shall be given unto you . That is no vain or untried promise , Ruth ! "
151509	151520	151521	151521	she	87	" I must never go to Mr Bradshaw 's again , "
151531	151540	151541	151541	he	3581	" No , Ruth , you shall not , "
151544	151552	151554	151554	she	87	" But I shall earn no money ! "
151573	151605	151554	151554	she	87	" You surely know , Ruth , that while Faith and I have a roof to shelter us , or bread to eat , you and Leonard share it with us . "
151606	151616	151618	151618	she	87	" I know I know your most tender goodness , "
151620	151628	151618	151618	she	87	" but it ought not to be . "
151629	151636	151637	151637	he	3581	" It must be at present , "
151645	151666	151637	151637	he	3581	" Perhaps before long you may have some employment ; perhaps it may be some time before an opportunity occurs . "
151667	151670	151672	151672	Ruth	87	" Hush , "
151674	151689	151672	151672	Ruth	87	" Leonard is moving about in the parlour . I must go to him . "
151716	151728	151730	151731	Mr Benson	149	" You must rest here . I will go to him , "
152110	152121	152100	152101	Mr Benson	149	" Ruth ! Leonard is just gone up to bed , "
152289	152335	152284	152284	she	170	" Oh , Thurstan ! take this basket it is such a weight ! Oh , Sally , is that you ? Here are some magnum - bonums which we must preserve to - morrow . There are guinea - fowl eggs in that basket . "
152392	152410	152388	152388	she	170	" Why , Thurstan , dear ! What 's the matter ? Is your back hurting you ? "
152426	152452	152411	152411	He	149	" No , Faith ! I am quite well , only rather out of spirits , and wanting to talk to you to cheer me . "
152469	152486	152453	152454	Miss Faith	170	" I do n't know how , but the real story about Ruth is found out . "
152487	152492	152494	152495	Miss Benson	149	" Oh , Thurstan ! "
152517	152523	152513	152513	she	170	" Does Mr Bradshaw know ? "
152524	152536	152513	152513	she	170	" Yes ! He sent for me , and told me . "
152537	152548	152513	152513	she	170	" Does Ruth know that it has all come out ? "
152549	152556	152513	152513	she	170	" Yes . And Leonard knows . "
152557	152564	152513	152513	she	170	" How ? Who told him ? "
152565	152585	152513	152513	she	170	" I do not know . I have asked no questions . But of course it was his mother . "
152586	152596	152598	152599	Miss Benson	149	" She was very foolish and cruel , then , "
152624	152671	152513	152513	she	170	" I think she was wise . I am sure it was not cruel . He must have soon known that there was some mystery , and it was better that it should be told him openly and quietly by his mother than by a stranger . "
152672	152680	152682	152683	Miss Benson	149	" How could she tell him quietly ? "
152688	152727	152513	152513	she	170	" Well ! perhaps I used the wrong word of course no one was by and I do n't suppose even they themselves could now tell how it was told , or in what spirit it was borne . "
152734	152741	152728	152729	Miss Benson	149	" Was Mr Bradshaw very angry ? "
152742	152763	152513	152513	she	170	" Yes , very ; and justly so . I did very wrong in making that false statement at first . "
152764	152774	152776	152777	Miss Faith	170	" No ! I am sure you did not , "
152779	152815	152776	152777	Miss Faith	170	" Ruth has had some years of peace , in which to grow stronger and wiser , so that she can bear her shame now in a way she never could have done at first . "
152816	152831	152513	152513	she	170	" All the same it was wrong in me to do what I did . "
152832	152870	152776	152777	Miss Faith	170	" I did it too , as much or more than you . And I do n't think it wrong . I 'm certain it was quite right , and I would do just the same again . "
152871	152885	152513	152513	she	170	" Perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me . "
152886	152910	152776	152777	Miss Faith	170	" Nonsense ! Thurstan . Do n't be morbid . I 'm sure you are as good and better than ever you were . "
152911	153046	152513	152513	she	170	" No , I am not . I have got what you call morbid just in consequence of the sophistry by which I persuaded myself that wrong could be right . I torment myself . I have lost my clear instincts of conscience . Formerly , if I believed that such or such an action was according to the will of God , I went and did it , or at least I tried to do it , without thinking of consequences . Now , I reason and weigh what will happen if I do so and so I grope where formerly I saw . Oh , Faith ! it is such a relief to me to have the truth known , that I am afraid I have not been sufficiently sympathising with Ruth . "
153047	153051	153053	153054	Miss Benson	149	" Poor Ruth ! "
153056	153082	153053	153054	Miss Benson	149	" But at any rate our telling a lie has been the saving of her . There is no fear of her going wrong now . "
153083	153093	152513	152513	she	170	" God 's omnipotence did not need our sin . "
153102	153113	152513	152513	she	170	" You have not told me what Mr Bradshaw said . "
153114	153173	152513	152513	she	170	" One ca n't remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in moments of such strong excitement . He was very angry , and said some things about me that were very just , and some about Ruth that were very hard . His last words were that he should give up coming to chapel . "
153174	153185	152513	152513	she	170	" Oh , Thurstan ! did it come to that ? "
153186	153189	152513	152513	she	170	" Yes . "
153190	153198	152513	152513	she	170	" Does Ruth know all he said ? "
153199	153322	152513	152513	she	170	" No ! Why should she ? I do n't know if she knows he has spoken to me at all . Poor creature ! she had enough to craze her almost without that ! She was for going away and leaving us , that we might not share in her disgrace . I was afraid of her being quite delirious . I did so want you , Faith ! However , I did the best I could ; I spoke to her very coldly , and almost sternly , all the while my heart was bleeding for her . I dared not give her sympathy ; I tried to give her strength . But I did so want you , Faith . "
153323	153357	153415	153415	she	170	" And I was so full of enjoyment , I am ashamed to think of it . But the Dawsons are so kind and the day was so fine Where is Ruth now ? "
153358	153388	152513	152513	she	170	" With Leonard . He is her great earthly motive I thought that being with him would be best . But he must be in bed and asleep now . "
153389	153397	153399	153400	Miss Faith	170	" I will go up to her , "
153444	153453	153440	153441	Miss Benson	149	" You must go to bed , Ruth ! "
153823	153890	153807	153807	she	173	" Oh , Mr Benson , I am so glad to see you ! I have so wanted to know all about you ! How is poor Ruth ? dear Ruth ! I wonder if she has forgiven me my cruelty to her ? And I may not go to her now , when I should be so glad and thankful to make up for it . "
153891	153911	153979	153979	she	3615	" I never heard you had been cruel to her . I am sure she does not think so . "
153912	153942	153943	153943	she	3615	" She ought ; she must . What is she doing ? Oh ! I have so much to ask , I can never hear enough ; and papa says "
153983	154002	153979	153979	she	3615	" Papa says I must not go to your house I suppose it 's right to obey him ? "
154003	154023	153979	153979	she	3615	" Certainly , my dear . It is your clear duty . We know how you feel towards us . "
154024	154067	154069	154069	she	3615	" Oh ! but if I could do any good if I could be of any use or comfort to any of you especially to Ruth , I should come , duty or not . I believe it would be my duty , "
154084	154129	154131	154131	she	3615	" No ! do n't be afraid ; I wo n't come till I know I can do some good . I hear bits about you through Sally every now and then , or I could not have waited so long . Mr Benson , "
154137	154148	154131	154131	she	3615	" I think you did quite right about poor Ruth . "
154149	154158	154131	154131	she	3615	" Not in the falsehood , my dear . "
154159	154240	154242	154242	she	3617	" No ! not perhaps in that . I was not thinking of that . But I have been thinking a great deal about poor Ruth 's you know I could not help it when everybody was talking about it and it made me think of myself , and what I am . With a father and mother , and home and careful friends , I am not likely to be tempted like Ruth ; but oh ! Mr Benson , "
154268	154416	154418	154418	she	3619	" if you knew all I have been thinking and feeling this last year , you would see how I have yielded to every temptation that was able to come to me ; and , seeing how I have no goodness or strength in me , and how I might just have been like Ruth , or rather , worse than she ever was , because I am more headstrong and passionate by nature , I do so thank you and love you for what you did for her ! And will you tell me really and truly now if I can ever do anything for Ruth ? If you 'll promise me that , I wo n't rebel unnecessarily against papa ; but if you do n't , I will , and come and see you all this very afternoon . Remember ! I trust you ! "
154434	154442	154444	154444	she	3619	" He must know something of it , "
154446	154453	154444	154444	she	3619	" Does he feel it much ? "
154454	154458	154460	154461	Mr Benson	149	" Very much , "
154469	154476	154478	154478	she	173	" It is hard upon him , "
154480	154484	154485	154486	Mr Benson	149	" It is , "
154712	154718	154719	154719	she	87	" Have patience with Leonard , "
154722	154779	154719	154719	she	87	" I have deserved the anger that is fretting in his heart . It is only I who can reinstate myself in his love and respect . I have no fear . When he sees me really striving hard and long to do what is right , he must love me . I am not afraid . "
155236	155241	155208	155208	her	87	" accepted her penance . "
155556	155559	155561	155561	Sally	154	" keep , "
156803	156848	156785	156785	they	3677	" Will you allow me to send you over my Times ? I have generally done with it before twelve o'clock , and after that it is really waste - paper in my house . You will oblige me by making use of it . "
156849	156879	156908	156908	he	204	" I am sure I am very much obliged to you for thinking of it . But do not trouble yourself to send it ; Leonard can fetch it . "
156880	156886	156892	156892	he	204	" How is Leonard now ? "
156916	156924	156908	156908	he	204	" I have not met him lately . "
156925	156928	156930	156931	Mr Benson	149	" No ! "
156955	156978	156943	156943	he	149	" Leonard is not strong , and we find it difficult to induce him to go much out - of - doors . "
157017	157065	157014	157014	he	204	" You will find rather a lengthened account of the exposure of Sir Thomas Campbell 's conduct at Baden . He seems to be a complete blackleg , in spite of his baronetcy . I fancy the papers are glad to get hold of anything just now . "
157066	157073	157075	157076	Mr Benson	149	" Who is Sir Thomas Campbell ? "
157078	157126	157014	157014	he	204	" Oh , I thought you might have heard the report a true one , I believe of Mr Donne 's engagement to his daughter . He must be glad she jilted him now , I fancy , after this public exposure of her father 's conduct . "
157152	157236	157139	157139	he	204	" Dick Bradshaw is my informant about all these projected marriages in high life they are not much in my way ; but since he has come down from London to take his share in the business , I think I have heard more of the news and the scandal of what , I suppose , would be considered high life , than ever I did before ; and Mr Donne 's proceedings seem to be an especial object of interest to him . "
157237	157251	157139	157139	he	204	" And Mr Donne is engaged to a Miss Campbell , is he ? "
157252	157286	157288	157289	Mr Farquhar	204	" Was engaged ; if I understood right , she broke off the engagement to marry some Russian prince or other a better match , Dick Bradshaw told me . I assure you , "
157293	157336	157288	157289	Mr Farquhar	204	" I am a very passive recipient of all such intelligence , and might very probably have forgotten all about it , if the Times of this morning had not been so full of the disgrace of the young lady 's father . "
157337	157348	157350	157351	Mr Benson	149	" Richard Bradshaw has quite left London , has he ? "
157377	157427	157428	157429	Mr Farquhar	204	" Yes . He has come to settle down here . I hope he may do well , and not disappoint his father , who has formed very high expectations from him ; I am not sure if they are not too high for any young man to realise . "
157451	157476	157478	157479	Mr Benson	149	" I am sure , I trust such a mortification such a grief as any disappointment in Richard , may not befall his father , "
157481	157486	157488	157489	Mr Farquhar	204	" Jemima Miss Bradshaw , "
157493	157513	157488	157489	Mr Farquhar	204	" was most anxious to hear of you all . I hope I may tell her you are all well "
157520	157522	157488	157489	Mr Farquhar	204	" that "
157523	157576	157577	157578	Mr Farquhar	204	" Thank you . Thank her for us . We are all well ; all except Leonard , who is not strong , as I said before . But we must be patient . Time , and such devoted , tender love as he has from his mother , must do much . "
157582	157621	157622	157624	The two gentlemen	3681	" Send him to my house for the papers . It will be a little necessity for him to have some regular exercise , and to face the world . He must do it , sooner or later . "
157860	157866	157868	157868	she	173	" Oh , Mr Farquhar ! "
157870	157936	157868	157868	she	173	" do you think they tell you the truth ? I wonder what Ruth can be doing to support herself and Leonard ? Nothing that you can hear of , you say ; and , of course , one must not ask the downright question . And yet I am sure they must be pinched in some way . Do you think Leonard is stronger ? "
157937	157990	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" I am not sure . He is growing fast ; and such a blow as he has had will be certain to make him more thoughtful and full of care than most boys of his age ; both these circumstances may make him thin and pale , which he certainly is . "
157991	158017	158018	158018	She	3693	" Oh ! how I wish I might go and see them all ! I could tell in a twinkling the real state of things . "
158028	158073	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" I will go again , and pay particular attention to anything you wish me to observe . You see , of course , I feel a delicacy about asking any direct questions , or even alluding in any way to these late occurrences . "
158074	158084	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" And you never see Ruth by any chance ? "
158085	158088	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" Never ! "
158105	158143	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" I will take the paper to - morrow myself ; it will be an excuse for calling again , and I will try to be very penetrating ; but I have not much hope of success . "
158144	158166	157843	157844	Mr Farquhar	204	" Oh , thank you . It is giving you a great deal of trouble ; but you are very kind . "
158167	158172	158173	158173	he	3696	" Kind , Jemima ! "
158188	158215	158173	158173	he	3696	" must I tell you how you can reward me ? Will you call me Walter ? say , thank you , Walter just for once . "
158265	158268	158270	158270	she	3693	" No ! "
158272	158294	158270	158270	she	3693	" I do n't think I can call you so . You are too old . It would not be respectful . "
158340	158345	158320	158320	He	3697	" Good - bye . "
158373	158385	158370	158370	her	3693	" I have not vexed you , have I , Walter ? "
158427	158455	158424	158424	she	3693	" You wo n't forbid my going to see Ruth , will you ? because if you do , I give you notice I shall disobey you . "
158494	158498	158500	158500	he	3697	" Tell me , "
158502	158534	158500	158500	he	3697	" how much of your goodness to me , this last happy hour , has been owing to the desire of having more freedom as a wife than as a daughter ? "
158603	158639	158600	158600	she	3693	" I do n't think you know how faithful I have been to you ever since the days when you first brought me pistachio - candy from London when I was quite a little girl . "
158640	158651	158600	158600	she	3693	" Not more faithful than I have been to you , "
158677	158693	158669	158669	he	3697	" and you have tried me pretty well . What a vixen you have been ! "
158751	158765	158734	158734	he	3697	" I may speak to your father , may not I , Jemima ? "
158862	158864	158873	158877	her simple - hearted mother	3707	" hooked "
159033	159036	159045	159045	he	156	" detection , "

160001	160047	160048	160048	she	154	" Bless thee , lad ! if it but amuses thee , they may shout through a ram 's horn to me , and I 'll never let on I 'm not deaf . It 's as good a use as I can be of , "
160053	160065	160048	160048	she	154	" if I can make that poor lad smile a bit . "
160080	160083	160085	160085	she	154	" There ! "
160098	160139	160085	160085	she	154	" look here , lad ! Here 's forty - two pound , seven shillings , and twopence ! It 's a mint of money , is n't it ? I took it all in sovereigns for fear of fire . "
160140	160149	160151	160151	he	110	" What is it all for , Sally ? "
160153	160169	160171	160171	she	154	" Aye , lad ! that 's asking . It 's Mr Benson 's money , "
160175	160193	160171	160171	she	154	" that I 've been keeping for him . Is he in the study , think ye ? "
160194	160208	160238	160238	she	154	" Yes ! I think so . Where have you been keeping it ? "
160209	160214	160215	160215	She	154	" Never you mind ! "
160245	160275	160238	160238	she	154	" I say if thou wilt , thou mayst do me a job of work some day . I 'm wanting a frame made for a piece of writing . "
160293	160299	160301	160301	she	154	" Here , Master Thurstan , "
160314	160323	160301	160301	she	154	" Take it , it 's all yours . "
160324	160333	160335	160335	he	110	" All mine ! What can you mean ? "
160349	160390	160343	160343	him	110	" Lock it up safe , out o ' the way . Dunnot go and leave it about to tempt folks . I 'll not answer for myself if money 's left about . I may be cribbing a sovereign . "
160391	160399	160401	160401	he	110	" But where does it come from ? "
160403	160407	160408	160408	she	154	" Come from ! "
160411	160435	160408	160408	she	154	" Where does all money come from , but the bank , to be sure ? I thought any one could tell that . "
160436	160445	160447	160447	he	110	" I have no money in the bank ! "
160454	160587	160343	160343	him	110	" No ! I knowed that ; but I had . Dunnot ye remember how you would raise my wage , last Martinmas eighteen year ? You and Faith were very headstrong , but I was too deep for you . See thee ! I went and put it i ' th ' bank . I was never going to touch it ; and if I had died it would have been all right , for I 'd a will made , all regular and tight made by a lawyer leastways he would have been a lawyer , if he had n't got transported first . And now , thinks I , I think I 'll just go and get it out and give it 'em . Banks is not always safe . "
160588	160611	160673	160674	Mr Benson	149	" I 'll take care of it for you with the greatest pleasure . Still , you know , banks allow interest . "
160612	160672	160343	160343	him	110	" D'ye suppose I do n't know all about interest , and compound interest too , by this time ? I tell ye I want ye to spend it . It 's your own . It 's not mine . It always was yours . Now you 're not going to fret me by saying you think it mine . "
160702	160761	160688	160688	She	3743	" Eh , bless ye , lad ! It 's the first kiss I 've had of ye sin ' ye were a little lad , and it 's a great refreshment . Now do n't you and Faith go and bother me with talking about it . It 's just yours , and make no more ado . "
160812	160823	160825	160825	she	3743	" It 's a pity to lose such fine writing , "
160827	160850	160851	160851	She	3743	" though I ca n't say as I can read it . Perhaps you 'd just read it for me , Leonard . "
160906	160909	160911	160911	she	3743	" testatrix , "
160915	160919	160911	160911	she	3743	" testy tricks . "
162078	162083	162056	162056	his	110	" law unto himself , "
162634	162640	162642	162642	Jemima	173	" Can you forgive me ? "
162648	162684	162642	162642	Jemima	173	" Forgive you ! What do you mean ? What have I to forgive ? The question is , can I ever thank you as I long to do , if I could find words ? "
162685	162696	162616	162616	Jemima	173	" Oh , Ruth , how I hated you once ! "
162697	162729	162642	162642	Jemima	173	" It was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did . You must have hated me when you knew how I was deceiving you all ! "
162730	162757	162616	162616	Jemima	173	" No , that was not it that made me hate you . It was before that . Oh , Ruth , I did hate you ! "
162776	162788	162772	162772	Ruth	87	" And you are going to be married to - morrow ! "
162789	162792	162794	162794	Jemima	173	" Yes , "
162796	162828	162794	162794	Jemima	173	" To - morrow , at nine o'clock . But I do n't think I could have been married without coming to wish Mr Benson and Miss Faith good - bye . "
162829	162836	162838	162838	Ruth	87	" I will go for them , "
162840	162881	162883	162883	she	87	" No , not just yet . I want to ask you one or two questions first . Nothing very particular ; only it seems as if there had been such a strange , long separation between us . Ruth , "
162889	162913	162915	162915	she	87	" is Leonard stronger than he was ? I was so sorry to hear about him from Walter . But he is better ? "
162919	162936	162938	162939	his mother	663	" Yes , he is better . Not what a boy of his age should be , "
162950	162955	162957	162957	she	87	" Oh , Jemima ! "
162959	162980	162957	162957	she	87	" my sharpest punishment comes through him . To think what he might have been , and what he is ! "
162981	162999	163000	163000	Jemima	173	" But Walter says he is both stronger in health , and not so nervous and shy . "
163028	163062	163063	163063	she	87	" He does not show that he feels his disgrace so much . I can not talk about it , Jemima , my heart aches so about him . But he is better , "
163083	163129	163063	163063	she	87	" He is only studying too closely now ; he takes to his lessons evidently as a relief from thought . He is very clever , and I hope and trust , yet I tremble to say it , I believe he is very good . "
163130	163200	163014	163014	she	173	" You must let him come and see us very often when we come back . We shall be two months away . We are going to Germany , partly on Walter 's business . Ruth , I have been talking to papa to - night , very seriously and quietly , and it has made me love him so much more , and understand him so much better . "
163201	163215	163217	163217	Ruth	87	" Does he know of your coming here ? I hope he does , "
163219	163416	163014	163014	she	173	" Yes . Not that he liked my doing it at all . But , somehow , I can always do things against a person 's wishes more easily when I am on good terms with them that 's not exactly what I meant ; but now to - night , after papa had been showing me that he really loved me more than I ever thought he had done for I always fancied he was so absorbed in Dick , he did not care much for us girls , I felt brave enough to say that I intended to come here and bid you all good - bye . He was silent for a minute , and then said I might do it , but I must remember he did not approve of it , and was not to be compromised by my coming ; still I can tell that , at the bottom of his heart , there is some of the old kindly feeling to Mr and Miss Benson , and I do n't despair of its all being made up , though , perhaps , I ought to say that mamma does . "
163417	163430	163432	163432	Ruth	87	" Mr and Miss Benson wo n't hear of my going away , "
163436	163442	163014	163014	she	173	" They are quite right . "
163443	163466	163014	163014	she	173	" But I am earning nothing . I can not get any employment . I am only a burden and an expense . "
163467	163589	163014	163014	she	173	" Are you not also a pleasure ? And Leonard , is he not a dear object of love ? It is easy for me to talk , I know , who am so impatient . Oh , I never deserved to be so happy as I am ! You do n't know how good Walter is . I used to think him so cold and cautious . But now , Ruth , will you tell Mr and Miss Benson that I am here ? There is signing of papers , and I do n't know what to be done at home . And when I come back , I hope to see you often , if you 'll let me . "
164024	164072	163998	163998	Jemima	173	" I have not many minutes to stay , only I felt as if I must see you . And we want Leonard to come to us to see all our German purchases , and hear all our German adventures . May he come to - morrow ? "
164073	164135	163998	163998	Jemima	173	" Yes ; thank you . Oh ! Jemima , I have heard something I have got a plan that makes me so happy ! I have not told any one yet . But Mr Wynne the parish doctor , you know has asked me if I would go out as a sick nurse he thinks he could find me employment . "
164136	164143	164145	164145	Jemima	173	" You , a sick nurse ! "
164174	164189	164145	164145	Jemima	173	" My dear Ruth , I do n't think you are fitted for it ! "
164190	164195	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" Do n't you ? "
164203	164276	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" I think I am ; at least , that I should be very soon . I like being about sick and helpless people ; I always feel so sorry for them ; and then I think I have the gift of a very delicate touch , which is such a comfort in many cases . And I should try to be very watchful and patient . Mr Wynne proposed it himself . "
164277	164315	164145	164145	Jemima	173	" It was not in that way I meant you were not fitted for it . I meant that you were fitted for something better . Why , Ruth , you are better educated than I am ! "
164316	164355	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" But if nobody will allow me to teach ? for that is what I suppose you mean . Besides , I feel as if all my education would be needed to make me a good sick nurse . "
164356	164365	164367	164367	Jemima	173	" Your knowledge of Latin , for instance , "
164389	164392	164394	164394	Ruth	87	" Well ! "
164396	164409	164394	164394	Ruth	87	" that wo n't come amiss ; I can read the prescriptions . "
164410	164421	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" Which the doctors would rather you did not do . "
164422	164449	164394	164394	Ruth	87	" Still , you ca n't say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my way , or will unfit me for my work . "
164450	164471	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" Perhaps not . But all your taste and refinement will be in your way , and will unfit you . "
164472	164570	164394	164394	Ruth	87	" You have not thought about this so much as I have , or you would not say so . Any fastidiousness I shall have to get rid of , and I shall be better without ; but any true refinement I am sure I shall find of use ; for do n't you think that every power we have may be made to help us in any right work , whatever that is ? Would you not rather be nursed by a person who spoke gently and moved quietly about than by a loud bustling woman ? "
164571	164623	164197	164197	Ruth	87	" Yes , to be sure ; but a person unfit for anything else may move quietly , and speak gently , and give medicine when the doctor orders it , and keep awake at night ; and those are the best qualities I ever heard of in a sick nurse . "
164637	164685	164634	164634	she	87	" At any rate it is work , and as such I am thankful for it . You can not discourage me and perhaps you know too little of what my life has been how set apart in idleness I have been to sympathise with me fully . "
164686	164718	164719	164719	she	87	" And I wanted you to come to see us me in my new home . Walter and I had planned that we would persuade you to come to us very often "
164729	164745	164724	164725	Mr Farquhar	204	" and now you will have to be fastened up in a sick - room . "
164746	164753	164755	164755	Ruth	87	" I could not have come , "
164758	164822	164755	164755	Ruth	87	" Dear Jemima ! it is like you to have thought of it but I could not come to your house . It is not a thing to reason about . It is just feeling . But I do feel as if I could not go . Dear Jemima ! if you are ill or sorrowful , and want me , I will come "
164823	164840	164724	164725	Mr Farquhar	204	" So you would and must to any one , if you take up that calling . "
164841	164880	164755	164755	Ruth	87	" But I should come to you , love , in quite a different way ; I should go to you with my heart full of love so full that I am afraid I should be too anxious . "
164881	164898	164724	164725	Mr Farquhar	204	" I almost wish I were ill , that I might make you come at once . "
164899	164946	164755	164755	Ruth	87	" And I am almost ashamed to think how I should like you to be in some position in which I could show you how well I remember that day that terrible day in the school - room . God bless you for it , Jemima ! "
166120	166177	166110	166111	Mr Benson	149	" I do not know . It would be a great advantage in some respects ; and yet I doubt whether it would in others . His mother 's influence over him is thoroughly good , and I should fear that any thoughtless allusions to his peculiar position might touch the raw spot in his mind . "
166178	166212	166461	166462	Mr Farquhar	204	" But he is so unusually clever , it seems a shame not to give him all the advantages he can have . Besides , does he see much of his mother now ? "
166213	166305	166110	166111	Mr Benson	149	" Hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with him , even at her busiest times ; she says it is her best refreshment . And often , you know , she is disengaged for a week or two , except the occasional services which she is always rendering to those who need her . Your offer is very tempting , but there is so decidedly another view of the question to be considered , that I believe we must refer it to her . "
166306	166335	166461	166462	Mr Farquhar	204	" With all my heart . Do n't hurry her to a decision . Let her weigh it well . I think she will find the advantages preponderate . "
166336	166357	166110	166111	Mr Benson	149	" I wonder if I might trouble you with a little business , Mr Farquhar , as you are here ? "
166358	166374	166461	166462	Mr Farquhar	204	" Certainly ; I am only too glad to be of any use to you . "
166375	166460	166110	166111	Mr Benson	149	" Why , I see from the report of the Star Life Assurance Company in the Times , which you are so good as to send me , that they have declared a bonus on the shares ; now it seems strange that I have received no notification of it , and I thought that perhaps it might be lying at your office , as Mr Bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares , and I have always received the dividends through your firm . "
166475	166487	166489	166489	he	204	" I 've no doubt that 's the way of it , "
166491	166553	166489	166489	he	204	" Some of our clerks have been careless about it ; or it may be Richard himself . He is not always the most punctual and exact of mortals ; but I 'll see about it . Perhaps after all it may n't come for a day or two ; they have always such numbers of these circulars to send out . "
166554	166592	166593	166594	Mr Farquhar	204	" Oh ! I 'm in no hurry about it . I only want to receive it some time before I incur any expenses , which the promise of this bonus may tempt me to indulge in . "
166926	166929	166930	166930	he	156	" Really , "
166933	166979	166930	166930	he	156	" these Dissenting ministers have no more notion of exactitude in their affairs than a child ! The idea of forgetting that he has sold his shares , and applying for the bonus , when it seems he has transferred them only a year ago ! "
166991	166999	167001	167001	he	156	" I do n't quite understand it , "
167003	167068	167001	167001	he	156	" Mr Benson was quite clear about it . He could not have received his half - yearly dividends unless he had been possessed of these shares ; and I do n't suppose Dissenting ministers , with all their ignorance of business , are unlike other men in knowing whether or not they receive the money that they believe to be owing to them . "
167069	167148	167219	167220	Mr Farquhar	204	" I should not wonder if they were if Benson was , at any rate . Why , I never knew his watch to be right in all my life it was always too fast or too slow ; it must have been a daily discomfort to him . It ought to have been . Depend upon it , his money matters are just in the same irregular state ; no accounts kept , I 'll be bound . "
167149	167158	167160	167161	Mr Farquhar	204	" I do n't see that that follows , "
167166	167191	167160	167161	Mr Farquhar	204	" That watch of his is a very curious one belonged to his father and grandfather , I do n't know how far back . "
167192	167218	167219	167220	Mr Farquhar	204	" And the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to keep it , to the inconvenience of himself and every one else . "
167231	167305	167219	167220	Mr Farquhar	204	" But about this letter . I wrote , at Mr Benson 's desire , to the Insurance Office , and I am not satisfied with this answer . All the transaction has passed through our hands . I do not think it is likely Mr Benson would write and sell the shares without , at any rate , informing us at the time , even though he forgot all about it afterwards . "
167306	167316	167160	167161	Mr Farquhar	204	" Probably he told Richard , or Mr Watson . "
167317	167349	167219	167220	Mr Farquhar	204	" We can ask Mr Watson at once . I am afraid we must wait till Richard comes home , for I do n't know where a letter would catch him . "
167371	167411	167367	167367	he	156	" You may depend upon it , Farquhar , the blunder lies with Benson himself . He is just the man to muddle away his money in indiscriminate charity , and then to wonder what has become of it . "
167422	167426	167428	167429	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Mr Watson , "
167439	167518	167428	167429	Mr Bradshaw	156	" here is some mistake about those Insurance shares we purchased for Benson ten or a dozen years ago . He spoke to Mr Farquhar about some bonus they are paying to the shareholders , it seems ; and , in reply to Mr Farquhar 's letter , the Insurance Company say the shares were sold twelve months since . Have you any knowledge of the transaction ? Has the transfer passed through your hands ? By the way "
167524	167535	167428	167429	Mr Bradshaw	156	" who kept the certificates ? Did Benson or we ? "
167536	167543	167545	167546	Mr Farquhar	204	" I really do n't know , "
167548	167556	167545	167546	Mr Farquhar	204	" Perhaps Mr Watson can tell us . "
167589	167597	167598	167598	he	265	" It seems very strange , sir , "
167610	167643	167604	167604	his	265	" for I paid Mr Benson the account of the dividends myself last June , and got a receipt in form , and that is since the date of the alleged transfer . "
167644	167654	167656	167657	Mr Farquhar	204	" Pretty nearly twelve months after it took place , "
167659	167680	167682	167683	Mr Bradshaw	156	" How did you receive the dividends ? An order on the Bank , along with old Mrs Cranmer 's ? "
167687	167711	167604	167604	his	265	" I do n't know how they came . Mr Richard gave me the money , and desired me to get the receipt . "
167712	167721	167723	167724	Mr Bradshaw	156	" It 's unlucky Richard is from home , "
167726	167737	167723	167724	Mr Bradshaw	156	" He could have cleared up this mystery for us . "
167743	167756	167758	167758	he	204	" Do you know where the certificates were kept , Mr Watson ? "
167760	167785	167604	167604	his	265	" I 'll not be sure , but I think they were with Mrs Cranmer 's papers and deeds in box A , 24 . "
167786	167814	167604	167604	his	265	" I wish old Cranmer would have made any other man his executor . She , too , is always coming with some unreasonable request or other . "
167815	167831	167604	167604	his	265	" Mr Benson 's inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable , at any rate . "
167854	167916	167918	167918	he	265	" I 'll not be sure , but I am almost certain , Mr Benson said , when I paid him last June , that he thought he ought to give the receipt on a stamp , and had spoken about it to Mr Richard the time before , but that Mr Richard said it was of no consequence . Yes , "
167929	167957	167918	167918	he	265	" he did I remember now and I thought to myself that Mr Richard was but a young man . Mr Richard will know all about it . "
167958	167961	167963	167964	Mr Farquhar	204	" Yes , "
167968	167978	167980	167981	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I sha n't wait till Richard 's return , "
167983	168058	167980	167981	Mr Bradshaw	156	" We can soon see if the certificates are in the box Watson points out ; if they are there , the Insurance people are no more fit to manage their concern than that cat , and I shall tell them so . If they are not there as I suspect will prove to be the case , it is just forgetfulness on Benson 's part , as I have said from the first . "
168059	168068	168070	168071	Mr Farquhar	204	" You forget the payment of the dividends , "
168078	168086	168088	168089	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Well , sir ! what then ? "
168134	168143	168145	168145	Watson	265	" I suppose I may go , sir , "
168166	168179	168181	168182	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Yes . Go . What do you mean about the dividends ? "
168189	168209	168211	168212	Mr Farquhar	204	" Simply , that I think there can have been no forgetfulness no mistake on Mr Benson 's part , "
168223	168259	168181	168182	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Then of course it is some blunder of that confounded Insurance Company . I will write to them to - day , and make them a little brisker and more correct in their statements . "
168260	168284	168181	168182	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Do n't you think it would be better to wait till Richard 's return ? He may be able to explain it . "
168285	168290	168292	168293	Mr Bradshaw	156	" No , sir ! "
168297	168361	168292	168293	Mr Bradshaw	156	" I do not think it would be better . It has not been my way of doing business to spare any one , or any company , the consequences of their own carelessness ; nor to obtain information second - hand when I could have it direct from the source . I shall write to the Insurance Office by the next post . "
168532	168542	168509	168509	he	3875	" On the part of the Star Insurance Company , "
168574	168601	168567	168567	he	156	" Desire the gentleman to walk up . Stay ! I will ring my bell in a minute or two , and then show him upstairs . "
168694	168765	168766	168766	He	156	" After all , I am a fool for once in my life . If the certificates are in no box which I have yet examined , that does not imply they may not be in some one which I have not had time to search . Farquhar would stay so late last night ! And even if they are in none of the boxes here , that does not prove "
168887	168893	168895	168896	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Sit down , sir ! "
168898	168944	168895	168896	Mr Bradshaw	156	" You are aware , sir , I presume , that I come on the part of Mr Dennison , the manager of the Star Insurance Company , to reply in person to a letter of yours , of the 29th , addressed to him ? "
168949	168957	168958	168958	he	156	" A very careless piece of business , "
168963	168992	168895	168896	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Mr Dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you have seen the deed of transfer , which I am commissioned to show you . "
169069	169077	169065	169066	Mr Bradshaw	156	" It is possible that it may be of
169101	169101	169080	169080	you	3885	"
169102	169116	169118	169119	the clerk	3885	" There can be no doubt of it , I think , sir , "
169133	169145	169146	169146	He	156	" I do n't know , sir I do n't know . "
169174	169191	169193	169193	he	156	" You have heard , sir , of such a thing as forgery forgery , sir ? "
169220	169260	169209	169209	he	156	" Oh , sir ! there is no room for imagining such a thing , I assure you . In our affairs we become aware of curious forgetfulness on the part of those who are not of business habits . "
169261	169301	169303	169303	he	156	" Still I should like to show it Mr Benson , to prove to him his forgetfulness , you know . I believe , on my soul , it is some of his careless forgetfulness I do , sir , "
169311	169340	169306	169306	he	156	" It must have been . Allow me to convince myself . You shall have it back to - night , or the first thing in the morning . "
169439	169480	169481	169481	he	156	" You are afraid , I see . I assure you , you may trust me . If there has been any fraud if I have the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise I threw out just now , "
169495	169517	169522	169522	he	156	" I will not fail to aid the ends of justice , even though the culprit should be my own son . "
169553	169578	169547	169547	he	156	" I do n't believe it I do n't believe it . I 'm convinced it 's a blunder of that old fool Benson . "
170068	170081	170065	170065	He	149	" That is right . It was you I wanted to see . "
170142	170146	170148	170148	he	156	" Read it ! "
170168	170174	170165	170165	he	149	" That is your signature ? "
170189	170196	170198	170199	Mr Benson	149	" No , it is not , "
170203	170226	170198	170199	Mr Benson	149	" It is very like my writing . I could almost say it was mine , but I know it is not . "
170227	170253	170165	170165	he	149	" Recollect yourself a little . The date is August the third of last year , fourteen months ago . You may have forgotten it . "
170287	170316	170198	170199	Mr Benson	149	" It is most singularly like mine ; but I could not have signed away these shares all the property I have without the slightest remembrance of it . "
170317	170366	170367	170367	He	149	" Stranger things have happened . For the love of Heaven , think if you did not sign it . It 's a deed of transfer for those Insurance shares , you see . You do n't remember it ? You did not write this name these words ? "
170438	170532	170430	170430	he	156	" Do n't imagine , sir , I wish to force any invention upon you as a remembrance . If you did not write this name , I know who did . Once more I ask you , does no glimmering recollection of having needed money , we 'll say I never wanted you to refuse my subscription to the chapel , God knows ! of having sold these accursed shares ? Oh ! I see by your face you did not write it ; you need not speak to me I know . "
170577	170587	170550	170550	he	156	" You say you did not write these words ? "
170598	170609	170550	170550	he	156	" I believe you ; Richard Bradshaw did write them . "
170610	170619	170621	170622	Mr Benson	149	" My dear sir my dear old friend ! "
170624	170651	170621	170622	Mr Benson	149	" you are rushing to a conclusion for which , I am convinced , there is no foundation ; there is no reason to suppose that because "
170652	170668	170669	170669	His	156	" There is reason , sir . Do not distress yourself I am perfectly calm . "
170680	170747	170669	170669	His	156	" What we have now to do is to punish the offence . I have not one standard for myself and those I love and , Mr Benson , I did love him and another for the rest of the world . If a stranger had forged my name , I should have known it was my duty to prosecute him . You must prosecute Richard . "
170748	170753	170755	170756	Mr Benson	149	" I will not , "
170758	170823	170824	170824	He	149	" You think , perhaps , that I shall feel it acutely . You are mistaken . He is no longer as my son to me . I have always resolved to disown any child of mine who was guilty of sin . I disown Richard . He is as a stranger to me . I shall feel no more at his exposure his punishment "
170836	170959	170831	170831	his	149	" Of course , you understand that I must feel shame at our connexion ; it is that that is troubling me ; that is but consistent with a man who has always prided himself on the integrity of his name ; but as for that boy , who has been brought up all his life as I have brought up my children , it must be some innate wickedness ! Sir , I can cut him off , though he has been as my right hand beloved . Let me be no hindrance to the course of justice , I beg . He has forged your name he has defrauded you of money of your all , I think you said . "
170960	170989	170824	170824	He	149	" Someone has forged my name . I am not convinced that it was your son . Until I know all the circumstances , I decline to prosecute . "
170990	170994	170996	170997	Mr Bradshaw	156	" What circumstances ? "
171016	171028	171132	171132	he	149	" The force of the temptation the previous habits of the person "
171029	171038	171039	171040	Mr Bradshaw	156	" Of Richard . He is the person , "
171054	171100	171044	171045	Mr Benson	149	" I should think it right to prosecute , if I found out that this offence against me was only one of a series committed , with premeditation , against society . I should then feel , as a protector of others more helpless than myself "
171101	171107	171109	171110	Mr Bradshaw	156	" It was your all , "
171112	171125	171127	171128	Mr Benson	149	" It was all my money ; it was not my all , "
171143	171213	171132	171132	he	149	" Against an habitual offender . I shall not prosecute Richard . Not because he is your son do not imagine that ! I should decline taking such a step against any young man without first ascertaining the particulars about him , which I know already about Richard , and which determine me against doing what would blast his character for life would destroy every good quality he has . "
171214	171222	171224	171225	Mr Bradshaw	156	" What good quality remains to him ? "
171227	171237	171132	171132	he	149	" He has deceived me he has offended God . "
171238	171246	171247	171248	Mr Benson	149	" Have we not all offended Him ? "
171256	171270	171247	171248	Mr Benson	149	" Not consciously . I never do wrong consciously . But Richard Richard . "
171313	171352	171309	171309	he	149	" It is no use talking , sir . You and I can not agree on these subjects . Once more , I desire you to prosecute that boy , who is no longer a child of mine . "
171353	171397	171309	171309	he	149	" Mr Bradshaw , I shall not prosecute him . I have said it once for all . To - morrow you will be glad that I do not listen to you . I should only do harm by saying more at present . "
171548	171582	171541	171541	he	156	" If there were more people like me , and fewer like you , there would be less evil in the world , sir . It 's your sentimentalists that nurse up sin . "
171678	171680	171718	171719	Mr Benson	149	" pluck "
171853	171879	171817	171817	She	154	" Here 's a woman down below as must see you directly . She 'll be upstairs after me if you 're not down quick . "
171880	171889	171924	171924	He	149	" Is it any one from Clarke 's ? "
171890	171900	171902	171902	she	154	" No , no ! not it , master , "
171908	171923	171902	171902	she	154	" I reckon it 's Mrs Bradshaw , for all she 's muffled up . "
171972	171977	171979	171979	she	154	" Oh ! sir , "
171991	172075	171979	171979	she	154	" you wo n't be so cruel , will you ? I have got some money somewhere some money my father settled on me , sir ; I do n't know how much , but I think it 's more than two thousand pounds , and you shall have it all . If I ca n't give it you now , I 'll make a will , sir . Only be merciful to poor Dick do n't go and prosecute him , sir . "
172076	172097	171956	171957	Mr Benson	149	" My dear Mrs Bradshaw , do n't agitate yourself in this way . I never meant to prosecute him . "
172098	172107	171979	171979	she	154	" But Mr Bradshaw says that you must . "
172108	172122	171956	171957	Mr Benson	149	" I shall not , indeed . I have told Mr Bradshaw so . "
172123	172237	171979	171979	she	154	" Has he been here ? Oh ! is not he cruel ? I do n't care . I 've been a good wife till now . I know I have . I have done all he bid me , ever since we were married . But now I will speak my mind , and say to everybody how cruel he is how hard to his own flesh and blood ! If he puts poor Dick in prison , I will go too . If I 'm to choose between my husband and my son , I choose my son ; for he will have no friends , unless I am with him . "
172238	172269	171956	171957	Mr Benson	149	" Mr Bradshaw will think better of it . You will see that , when his first anger and disappointment are over , he will not be hard or cruel . "
172270	172278	172280	172280	she	3927	" You do n't know Mr Bradshaw , "
172284	172338	172280	172280	she	3927	" if you think he 'll change . I might beg and beg I have done many a time , when we had little children , and I wanted to save them a whipping but no begging ever did any good . At last I left it off . He 'll not change . "
172339	172355	172359	172359	his	3928	" Perhaps not for human entreaty . Mrs Bradshaw , is there nothing more powerful ? "
172368	172379	172381	172381	she	3927	" If you mean that God may soften his heart , "
172385	172403	172404	172404	she	3927	" I 'm not going to deny God 's power I have need to think of Him , "
172412	172448	172404	172404	she	3927	" for I am a very miserable woman . Only think ! he cast it up against me last night , and said , if I had not spoilt Dick this never would have happened . "
172449	172496	172500	172500	he	3929	" He hardly knew what he was saying last night . I will go to Mr Farquhar 's directly , and see him ; and you had better go home , my dear Mrs Bradshaw ; you may rely upon our doing all that we can . "
172636	172642	172644	172645	Mr Benson	149	" What can we do ? "
172654	172720	172865	172866	the girls	420	" That is just what I was asking myself . I think I must see Mr Bradshaw , and try and bring him a little out of this unmerciful frame of mind . That must be the first thing . Will you object to accompany me at once ? It seems of particular consequence that we should subdue his obduracy before the affair gets wind . "
172721	172833	172865	172866	the girls	420	" I will go with you willingly . But I believe I rather serve to irritate Mr Bradshaw ; he is reminded of things he has said to me formerly , and which he thinks he is bound to act up to . However , I can walk with you to the door , and wait for you if you 'll allow me in the street . I want to know how he is to - day , both bodily and mentally ; for indeed , Mr Farquhar , I should not have been surprised last night if he had dropped down dead , so terrible was his strain upon himself . "
172852	172863	172865	172866	the girls	420	" Oh , Mr Farquhar , what is the matter ? "
172872	172943	172865	172866	the girls	420	" Mamma sits crying in the old nursery . We believe she has been there all night . She will not tell us what it is , nor let us be with her ; and papa is locked up in his room , and wo n't even answer us when we speak , though we know he is up and awake , for we heard him tramping about all night . "
172944	172952	172954	172955	Mr Farquhar	204	" Let me go up to him , "
172957	172972	172954	172955	Mr Farquhar	204	" He wo n't let you in . It will be of no use . "
173120	173146	173111	173111	He	204	" Come home and breakfast with me . I am off to London in an hour or two , and must speak with you first . "
173175	173184	173186	173186	he	204	" Now I can tell you about it , "
173188	173241	173186	173186	he	204	" I see my way clearly to a certain point . We must prevent Dick and his father meeting just now , or all hope of Dick 's reformation is gone for ever . His father is as hard as the nether mill - stone . He has forbidden me his house . "
173242	173246	173152	173152	he	204	" Forbidden you ! "
173247	173487	173186	173186	he	204	" Yes ; because I would not give up Dick as utterly lost and bad ; and because I said I should return to London with the clerk , and fairly tell Dennison he 's a Scotchman , and a man of sense and feeling the real state of the case . By the way , we must not say a word to the clerk ; otherwise he will expect an answer , and make out all sorts of inferences for himself , from the unsatisfactory reply he must have . Dennison will be upon honour will see every side of the case will know you refuse to prosecute ; the Company of which he is manager are no losers . Well ! when I said what I thought wise , of all this when I spoke as if my course were a settled and decided thing , the grim old man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own house . He assured me he had no feeling for Dick all the time he was shaking like an aspen ; in short , repeated much the same things he must have said to you last night . However , I defied him ; and the consequence is , I 'm forbidden the house , and , what is more , he says he will not come to the office while I remain a partner . "
173488	173494	173152	173152	he	204	" What shall you do ? "
173495	173604	173186	173186	he	204	" Send Jemima and the baby . There 's nothing like a young child for bringing people round to a healthy state of feeling ; and you do n't know what Jemima is , Mr Benson ! No ! though you 've known her from her birth . If she ca n't comfort her mother , and if the baby ca n't steal into her grandfather 's heart , why I do n't know what you may do to me . I shall tell Jemima all , and trust to her wit and wisdom to work at this end , while I do my best at the other . "
173605	173614	173152	173152	he	204	" Richard is abroad , is not he ? "
173615	173702	173186	173186	he	204	" He will be in England to - morrow . I must catch him somewhere ; but that I can easily do . The difficult point will be , what to do with him what to say to him , when I find him . He must give up his partnership , that 's clear . I did not tell his father so , but I am resolved upon it . There shall be no tampering with the honour of the firm to which I belong . "
173703	173711	173713	173714	Mr Benson	149	" But what will become of him ? "
173718	173812	173814	173814	he	3946	" I do not yet know . But , for Jemima 's sake for his dear old father 's sake I will not leave him adrift . I will find him some occupation as clear from temptation as I can . I will do all in my power . And he will do much better , if he has any good in him , as a freer agent , not cowed by his father into a want of individuality and self - respect . I believe I must dismiss you , Mr Benson , "
173821	173849	173814	173814	he	3946	" I have to explain all to my wife , and to go to that clerk . You shall hear from me in a day or two . "
174173	174179	174181	174181	she	173	" Oh , Mr Benson ! "
174183	174353	174181	174181	she	173	" will you come with me , and tell papa this sad news about Dick ? Walter has written me a letter at last to say he has found him he could not at first ; but now it seems that , the day before yesterday , he heard of an accident which had happened to the Dover coach ; it was overturned two passengers killed , and several badly hurt . Walter says we ought to be thankful , as he is , that Dick was not killed . He says it was such a relief to him on going to the place the little inn nearest to where the coach was overturned to find that Dick was only severely injured ; not one of those who was killed . But it is a terrible shock to us all . We had had no more dreadful fear to lessen the shock ; mamma is quite unfit for anything , and we none of us dare to tell papa . "
174372	174386	174388	174389	Mr Benson	149	" How is your father ? I have wanted to hear every day , "
174393	174483	174181	174181	she	173	" It was careless of me not to come and tell you ; but , indeed , I have had so much to do . Mamma would not go near him . He has said something which she seems as if she could not forgive . Because he came to meals , she would not . She has almost lived in the nursery ; taking out all Dick 's old playthings , and what clothes of his were left , and turning them over , and crying over them . "
174484	174513	174181	174181	she	173	" Then Mr Bradshaw has joined you again ; I was afraid , from what Mr Farquhar said , he was going to isolate himself from you all ? "
174514	174520	174522	174522	Jemima	173	" I wish he had , "
174527	174603	174522	174522	Jemima	173	" It would have been more natural than the way he has gone on ; the only difference from his usual habits is , that he has never gone near the office , or else he has come to meals just as usual , and talked just as usual ; and even done what I never knew him do before , tried to make jokes all in order to show us how little he cares . "
174604	174613	174700	174700	she	3960	" Does he not go out at all ? "
174614	174670	174522	174522	Jemima	173	" Only in the garden . I am sure he does care after all ; he must care ; he can not shake off a child in this way , though he thinks he can ; and that makes me so afraid of telling him of this accident . Will you come , Mr Benson ? "
174730	174738	174718	174718	she	3960	" Papa , here is Mr Benson , "
174815	174822	174824	174825	Mr Benson	149	" Mrs Farquhar has asked me , "
174836	174850	174851	174851	he	149	" to tell you about a letter she has received from her husband ; "
174882	174965	175033	175034	the father	2694	" She need not have given you that trouble . I am aware of the reason of Mr Farquhar 's absence . I entirely disapprove of his conduct . He is regardless of my wishes ; and disobedient to the commands which , as my son - in - law , I thought he would have felt bound to respect . If there is any more agreeable subject that you can introduce , I shall be glad to hear you , sir . "
174966	174993	175033	175034	the father	2694	" Neither you , nor I , must think of what we like to hear or to say . You must hear what concerns your son . "
174994	175006	175008	175008	he	3968	" I have disowned the young man who was my son , "
175012	175020	175022	175023	Mr Benson	149	" The Dover coach has been overturned , "
175095	175113	175114	175114	he	149	" Oh ! I have been too sudden , sir he is alive , he is alive ! "
175175	175180	175182	175182	he	149	" Oh , Jemima ! "
175184	175207	175209	175209	he	149	" I have done it so badly I have been so cruel he is very ill , I fear bring water , brandy "
175239	175253	175255	175255	Jemima	173	" Fetch my mother , Mary . Send for the doctor , Elizabeth , "
175636	175647	175619	175619	he	149	" He is alive , sir ; is he not ? "
175648	175674	175676	175677	Mr Benson	149	" Yes , sir indeed he is ; he is only hurt . He is sure to do well . Mr Farquhar is with him , "
175781	175785	175766	175766	he	156	" Thank God ! "
176451	176456	176458	176459	Mr Benson	149	" Rely upon it , "
176461	176479	176458	176459	Mr Benson	149	" he has not only attended to it , but treasured up every expression you have used . "
176480	176556	176434	176434	he	204	" Well , I tried to get some opinion , or sign of emotion , out of him . I had not much hope of the latter , I must own ; but I thought he would have said whether I had done wisely or not in procuring that Glasgow situation for Dick that he would , perhaps , have been indignant at my ousting him from the partnership so entirely on my own responsibility . "
176557	176564	176458	176459	Mr Benson	149	" How did Richard take it ? "
176565	176815	176434	176434	he	204	" Oh , nothing could exceed his penitence . If one had never heard of the proverb , ' When the devil was sick , the devil a monk would be , ' I should have had greater faith in him ; or if he had had more strength of character to begin with , or more reality and less outward appearance of good principle instilled into him . However , this Glasgow situation is the very thing ; clear , defined duties , no great trust reposed in him , a kind and watchful head , and introductions to a better class of associates than I fancy he has ever been thrown amongst before . For , you know , Mr Bradshaw dreaded all intimacies for his son , and wanted him to eschew all society beyond his own family would never allow him to ask a friend home . Really , when I think of the unnatural life Mr Bradshaw expected him to lead , I get into charity with him , and have hopes . By the way , have you ever succeeded in persuading his mother to send Leonard to school ? He may run the same risk from isolation as Dick : not be able to choose his companions wisely when he grows up , but be too much overcome by the excitement of society to be very discreet as to who are his associates . Have you spoken to her about my plan ? "
176816	176863	176458	176459	Mr Benson	149	" Yes ! but to no purpose . I can not say that she would even admit an argument on the subject . She seemed to have an invincible repugnance to the idea of exposing him to the remarks of other boys on his peculiar position . "
176864	176893	176434	176434	he	204	" They need never know of it . Besides , sooner or later , he must step out of his narrow circle , and encounter remark and scorn . "
176894	176897	176899	176900	Mr Benson	149	" True , "
176904	176963	176899	176900	Mr Benson	149	" And you may depend upon it , if it really is the best for Leonard , she will come round to it by - and - by . It is almost extraordinary to see the way in which her earnest and most unselfish devotion to this boy 's real welfare leads her to right and wise conclusions . "
176964	177082	176434	176434	he	204	" I wish I could tame her so as to let me meet her as a friend . Since the baby was born , she comes to see Jemima . My wife tells me , that she sits and holds it soft in her arms , and talks to it as if her whole soul went out to the little infant . But if she hears a strange footstep on the stair , what Jemima calls the ' wild - animal look ' comes back into her eyes , and she steals away like some frightened creature . With all that she has done to redeem her character , she should not be so timid of observation . "
177083	177334	176899	176900	Mr Benson	149	" You may well say ' with all that she has done ! ' We of her own household hear little or nothing of what she does . If she wants help , she simply tells us how and why ; but if not perhaps because it is some relief to her to forget for a time the scenes of suffering in which she has been acting the part of comforter , and perhaps because there always was a shy , sweet reticence about her we never should know what she is and what she does , except from the poor people themselves , who would bless her in words if the very thought of her did not choke them with tears . Yet , I do assure you , she passes out of all this gloom , and makes sunlight in our house . We are never so cheerful as when she is at home . She always had the art of diffusing peace , but now it is positive cheerfulness . And about Leonard ; I doubt if the wisest and most thoughtful schoolmaster could teach half as much directly , as his mother does unconsciously and indirectly every hour that he is with her . Her noble , humble , pious endurance of the consequences of what was wrong in her early life , seems expressly fitted to act upon him , whose position is unjustly , for he has done no harm so similar to hers . "
177335	177422	176434	176434	he	204	" Well ! I suppose we must leave it alone for the present . You will think me a hard practical man when I own to you , that all I expect from Leonard 's remaining a home - bird is that , with such a mother , it will do him no harm . At any rate , remember my offer is the same for a year two years hence , as now . What does she look forward to making him into , finally ? "
177423	177478	176899	176900	Mr Benson	149	" I do n't know . The wonder comes into my mind sometimes ; but never into hers , I think . It is part of her character part perhaps of that which made her what she was that she never looks forward , and seldom back . The present is enough for her . "
177526	177663	177523	177523	she	4724	" Now , do you know , I never liked poor Dick ; and yet I 'm angry with Mr Farquhar for getting him out of the partnership in such a summary way . I ca n't get over it , even though he has offered to send Leonard to school . And here he 's reigning lord - paramount at the office ! As if you , Thurstan , were n't as well able to teach him as any schoolmaster in England ! But I should not mind that affront , if I were not sorry to think of Dick though I never could abide him labouring away in Glasgow for a petty salary of nobody knows how little , while Mr Farquhar is taking halves , instead of thirds , of the profits here ! "
178188	178199	178201	178201	he	149	" I am determined to tell his father of this , "
178203	178224	178201	178201	he	149	" I think his family are far too obedient to his tacit prohibition of all mention of Richard 's name . "
178225	178229	178231	178232	Mr Benson	149	" Tacit prohibition ? "
178234	178413	178231	178232	Mr Benson	149	" Oh ! I dare say I use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness of a scholar ; but what I mean is , that he made a point of immediately leaving the room if Richard 's name was mentioned ; and did it in so marked a manner , that by degrees they understood that it was their father 's desire that he should never be alluded to ; which was all very well as long as there was nothing pleasant to be said about him ; but to - night I am going there , and shall take good care he does not escape me before I have told him all I have heard and observed about Richard . He will never be a hero of virtue , for his education has drained him of all moral courage ; but with care , and the absence of all strong temptation for a time , he will do very well ; nothing to gratify paternal pride , but certainly nothing to be ashamed of . "
179531	179542	179544	179544	he	149	" To be sure , my dear ! Sit down , "
179597	179638	179594	179594	she	87	" I want to tell you , that I have been this morning and offered myself as matron to the fever - ward while it is so full . They have accepted me ; and I am going this evening . "
179639	179662	179594	179594	she	87	" Oh , Ruth ! I feared this ; I saw your look this morning as we spoke of this terrible illness . "
179663	179702	179594	179594	she	87	" Why do you say ' fear , ' Mr Benson ? You yourself have been with John Harrison , and old Betty , and many others , I dare say , of whom we have not heard . "
179703	179730	179594	179594	she	87	" But this is so different ! in such poisoned air ! among such malignant cases ! Have you thought and weighed it enough , Ruth ? "
179762	179793	179749	179749	she	4079	" Yes ! I have thought , and I have weighed . But through the very midst of all my fears and thoughts I have felt that I must go . "
179821	179870	179872	179872	she	4079	" I believe I have no fear . That is a great preservative , they say . At any rate , if I have a little natural shrinking , it is quite gone when I remember that I am in God 's hands ! Oh , Mr Benson , "
179880	179885	179872	179872	she	4079	" Leonard , Leonard ! "
179901	179907	179909	179909	he	110	" Poor , poor mother ! "
179911	179948	179909	179909	he	110	" Be of good heart . He , too , is in God 's hands . Think what a flash of time only will separate you from him , if you should die in this work ! "
179949	179969	179872	179872	she	4079	" But he but he it will be long to him , Mr Benson ! He will be alone ! "
179970	180024	179909	179909	he	110	" No , Ruth , he will not . God and all good men will watch over him . But if you can not still this agony of fear as to what will become of him , you ought not to go . Such tremulous passion will predispose you to take the fever . "
180025	180032	180033	180033	she	4081	" I will not be afraid , "
180054	180071	180033	180033	she	4081	" I am not afraid for myself . I will not be so for my darling . "
180201	180238	180262	180262	she	87	" It is not alone on your account , my dear ! There may be many sick people of whom , if I can give no other comfort , I can take intelligence to their friends . "
180274	180294	180262	180262	she	87	" I believe I am a great coward . I stand here talking because I dread to tell Leonard . "
180295	180303	180305	180305	he	4085	" You must not think of it , "
180307	180320	180305	180305	he	4085	" Leave it to me . It is sure to unnerve you . "
180321	180350	180352	180352	she	87	" I must think of it . I shall have self - control enough in a minute to do it calmly to speak hopefully . For only think , "
180365	180384	180352	180352	she	87	" what a comfort the remembrance of the last few words may be to the poor fellow , if "
180396	180399	180401	180401	she	87	" No ! "
180403	180476	180401	180401	she	87	" that must be done ; but perhaps you will spare me one thing will you tell Aunt Faith ? I suppose I am very weak , but , knowing that I must go , and not knowing what may be the end , I feel as if I could not bear to resist her entreaties just at last . Will you tell her , sir , while I go to Leonard ? "
180720	180725	180714	180714	herself	87	" Good - bye , "
180755	180769	180771	180772	Miss Benson	149	" They wo n't let you have your flowers , I 'm afraid , "
180774	180783	180771	180772	Miss Benson	149	" Doctors so often object to the smell . "
180784	180790	180792	180792	Ruth	87	" No ; perhaps not , "
180796	180818	180792	180792	Ruth	87	" I did not think of it . I will only keep this one rose . Here , Leonard , darling ! "
180918	180923	180925	180926	Miss Faith	170	" Now , Leonard , "
180928	180947	180925	180926	Miss Faith	170	" be a brave boy . I feel sure she will come back to us before very long . "
181315	181332	181334	181334	one	325	" They say she has been a great sinner , and that this is her penance , "
181357	181450	181451	181453	the old man	887	" Such a one as her has never been a great sinner ; nor does she do her work as a penance , but for the love of God , and of the blessed Jesus . She will be in the light of God 's countenance when you and I will be standing afar off . I tell you , man , when my poor wench died , as no one would come near , her head lay at that hour on this woman 's sweet breast . I could fell you , "
181462	181484	181451	181453	the old man	887	" for calling that woman a great sinner . The blessing of them who were ready to perish is upon her . "
181641	181649	181636	181636	he	110	" Sir , I am her son ! "
181650	181663	181665	181667	an old woman	4856	" Thou ! thou her bairn ! God bless you , lad , "
181674	181736	181665	181667	an old woman	4856	" It was but last night she kept my child quiet with singing psalms the night through . Low and sweet , low and sweet , they tell me till many poor things were hushed , though they were out of their minds , and had not heard psalms this many a year . God in heaven bless you , lad ! "
181760	181766	181755	181755	he	4127	" She is my mother . "
181781	181789	181771	181771	Leonard	110	" many arose and called her blessed . "
182054	182062	182067	182068	Miss Benson	149	" I Must Go and Nurse Mr Bellingham "
182327	182453	182322	182322	she	264	" Lie still ! Do n't move ! You must be content to - day to be waited upon , and nursed ! I have just seen Miss Benson in the lobby , and had charge upon charge not to fatigue you . Oh , Ruth ! how we all love you , now we have you back again ! Do you know , I taught Rosa to say her prayers as soon as ever you were gone to that horrid place , just on purpose that her little innocent lips might pray for you I wish you could hear her say it ' Please , dear God , keep Ruth safe . ' Oh , Leonard ! are not you proud of your mother ? "
182456	182459	182465	182465	he	110	" Yes , "
182492	182595	182488	182488	Jemima	173	" Now , Ruth ! I have got a plan for you . Walter and I have partly made it ; and partly it 's papa 's doing . Yes , dear ! papa has been quite anxious to show his respect for you . We all want you to go to the dear Eagle 's Crag for this next month , and get strong , and have some change in that fine air at Abermouth . I am going to take little Rosa there . Papa has lent it to us . And the weather is often very beautiful in November . "
182596	182648	182488	182488	Jemima	173	" Thank you very much . It is very tempting ; for I have been almost longing for some such change . I can not tell all at once whether I can go ; but I will see about it , if you will let me leave it open a little . "
182649	182689	182488	182488	Jemima	173	" Oh ! as long as you like , so that you will but go at last . And , Master Leonard ! you are to come too . Now , I know I have you on my side . "
182737	182759	182796	182796	she	87	" What happy evenings we shall have together ! Do you know , I think Mary and Elizabeth may perhaps come . "
182770	182793	182796	182796	she	87	" Look ! how bright and propitious for our plans . Dear Ruth , it seems like an omen for the future ! "
182891	182898	182900	182901	Miss Benson	149	" Go and tell your uncle , "
182905	182953	182900	182901	Miss Benson	149	" Stop , my boy ! I have just met Mr Benson in the street , and my errand now is to your mother . I should like you to remain and hear what it is ; and I am sure that my business will give these ladies "
182978	182978	182966	182966	I	0	"
182995	183064	182979	182979	He	279	" You ran away from us yesterday so quietly and cunningly , Mrs Denbigh , that you were , perhaps , not aware that the Board was sitting at that very time , and trying to form a vote sufficiently expressive of our gratitude to you . As Chairman , they requested me to present you with this letter , which I shall have the pleasure of reading . "
183121	183153	183155	183155	he	279	" There , sir ! when you are an old man , you may read that testimony to your mother 's noble conduct with pride and pleasure . For , indeed , "
183161	183296	183155	183155	he	279	" no words can express the relief it was to us . I speak of the gentlemen composing the Board of the Infirmary . When Mrs Denbigh came forward , the panic was at its height , and the alarm of course aggravated the disorder . The poor creatures died rapidly ; there was hardly time to remove the dead bodies before others were brought in to occupy the beds , so little help was to be procured on account of the universal terror ; and the morning when Mrs Denbigh offered us her services , we seemed at the very worst . I shall never forget the sensation of relief in my mind when she told us what she proposed to do ; but we thought it right to warn her to the full extent
183297	183302	183304	183304	he	279	" Nay , madam , "
183315	183355	183304	183304	he	279	" I will spare you any more praises . I will only say , if I can be a friend to you , or a friend to your child , you may command my poor powers to the utmost . "
183412	183520	183403	183403	her	87	" I could not tell him just then . I durst not speak for fear of breaking down ; but if I have done right , it was all owing to you and Mr Benson . Oh ! I wish I had said how the thought first came into my head from seeing the things Mr Benson has done so quietly ever since the fever first came amongst us . I could not speak ; and it seemed as if I was taking those praises to myself , when all the time I was feeling how little I deserved them how it was all owing to you . "
183521	183527	183529	183530	Miss Benson	149	" Under God , Ruth , "
183537	183583	183585	183585	she	4161	" Oh ! I think there is nothing humbles one so much as undue praise . While he was reading that letter , I could not help feeling how many things I have done wrong ! Could he know of of what I have been ? "
183593	183596	183598	183598	Jemima	173	" Yes ! "
183600	183621	183622	183622	she	173	" he knew everybody in Eccleston did know but the remembrance of those days is swept away . Miss Benson , "
183634	183663	183626	183626	she	173	" you must be on my side , and persuade Ruth to come to Abermouth for a few weeks . I want her and Leonard both to come . "
183664	183713	183714	183715	Miss Benson	149	" I 'm afraid my brother will think that Leonard is missing his lessons sadly . Just of late we could not wonder that the poor child 's heart was so full ; but he must make haste , and get on all the more for his idleness . "
183723	183776	183714	183715	Miss Benson	149	" Oh , as for lessons , Walter is so very anxious that you should give way to his superior wisdom , Ruth , and let Leonard go to school . He will send him to any school you fix upon , according to the mode of life you plan for him . "
183777	183783	183785	183785	Ruth	87	" I have no plan , "
183787	183809	183785	183785	Ruth	87	" I have no means of planning . All I can do is to try and make him ready for anything . "
183810	183813	183815	183815	Jemima	173	" Well , "
183817	183885	183815	183815	Jemima	173	" we must talk it over at Abermouth ; for I am sure you wo n't refuse to come , dearest , dear Ruth ! Think of the quiet , sunny days , and the still evenings , that we shall have together , with little Rosa to tumble about among the fallen leaves ; and there 's Leonard to have his first sight of the sea . "
183886	183893	183895	183895	Ruth	87	" I do think of it , "
183935	183942	183944	183944	she	154	" Oh ! dear , dear ! "
183950	183984	183986	183986	she	154	" If I had but known that the rector was coming to call , I 'd ha ' put on the best covers , and the Sunday tablecloth ! You 're well enough , "
183995	184030	184032	184032	she	154	" you 're always trim and dainty in your gowns , though I reckon they cost but tuppence a yard , and you 've a face to set 'em off ; but as for you "
184038	184081	184032	184032	she	154	" I think you might ha ' had something better on than that old stuff , if it had only been to do credit to a parishioner like me , whom he has known ever sin ' my father was his clerk . "
184082	184114	184115	184116	Miss Benson	149	" You forget , Sally , I have been making jelly all the morning . How could I tell it was Mr Grey when there was a knock at the door ? "
184119	184198	184032	184032	she	154	" You might ha ' letten me do the jelly ; I'se warrant I could ha ' pleased Ruth as well as you . If I had but known he was coming , I 'd ha ' slipped round the corner and bought ye a neck - ribbon , or summut to lighten ye up . I'se loath he should think I 'm living with Dissenters , that do n't know how to keep themselves trig and smart . "
184199	184234	184032	184032	she	154	" Never mind , Sally ; he never thought of me . What he came for , was to see Ruth ; and , as you say , she 's always neat and dainty . "
184235	184285	184032	184032	she	154	" Well ! I reckon it can not be helped now ; but if I buy ye a ribbon , will you promise to wear it when church - folks come ? for I can not abide the way they have of scoffing at the Dissenters about their dress . "
184286	184296	184298	184299	Miss Benson	149	" Very well ! we 'll make that bargain , "
184301	184319	184298	184299	Miss Benson	149	" and now , Ruth , I 'll go and fetch you a cup of warm jelly . "
184320	184328	184330	184330	Ruth	87	" Oh ! indeed , Aunt Faith , "
184332	184360	184330	184330	Ruth	87	" I am very sorry to balk you ; but if you 're going to treat me as an invalid , I am afraid I shall rebel . "
184501	184555	184557	184557	he	276	" Well ! so you had our worthy rector here to - day ; I am come on something of the same kind of errand ; only I shall spare you the reading of my letter , which , I 'll answer for it , he did not . Please to take notice , "
184565	184620	184557	184557	he	276	" that I have delivered you a vote of thanks from my medical brothers ; and open and read it at your leisure ; only not just now , for I want to have a little talk with you on my own behoof . I want to ask you a favour , Mrs Denbigh . "
184621	184625	184627	184627	Ruth	87	" A favour ! "
184629	184653	184627	184627	Ruth	87	" what can I do for you ? I think I may say I will do it , without hearing what it is . "
184654	184663	184665	184665	he	276	" Then you 're a very imprudent woman , "
184667	184687	184665	184665	he	276	" however , I 'll take you at your word . I want you to give me your boy . "
184688	184691	184627	184627	Ruth	87	" Leonard ! "
184692	184730	184665	184665	he	276	" Aye ! there it is , you see , Mr Benson . One minute she is as ready as can be , and the next , she looks at me as if I was an ogre ! "
184731	184741	184743	184744	Mr Benson	149	" Perhaps we do n't understand what you mean , "
184746	184855	184871	184871	he	4166	" The thing is this . You know I 've no children ; and I ca n't say I 've ever fretted over it much ; but my wife has ; and whether it is that she has infected me , or that I grieve over my good practice going to a stranger , when I ought to have had a son to take it after me , I do n't know ; but , of late , I 've got to look with covetous eyes on all healthy boys , and at last I 've settled down my wishes on this Leonard of yours , Mrs Denbigh . "
184878	184887	184888	184888	He	4166	" Now , how old is the lad ? "
184897	184905	184893	184894	Miss Benson	149	" He 'll be twelve next February . "
184906	184932	184933	184933	He	4166	" Umph ! only twelve ! He 's tall and old - looking for his age . You look young enough , it is true . "
184955	184982	184984	184984	he	4166	" Twelve , is he ! Well , I take him from now . I do n't mean that I really take him away from you , "
184997	185221	184984	184984	he	4166	" His being your son the son of one whom I have seen as I have seen you , Mrs Denbigh out and out the best nurse I ever met with , Miss Benson ; and good nurses are things we doctors know how to value his being your son is his great recommendation to me ; not but what the lad himself is a noble boy . I shall be glad to leave him with you as long and as much as we can ; he could not be tied to your apron - strings all his life , you know . Only I provide for his education , subject to your consent and good pleasure , and he is bound apprentice to me . I , his guardian , bind him to myself , the first surgeon in Eccleston , be the other who he may ; and in process of time he becomes partner , and some day or other succeeds me . Now , Mrs Denbigh , what have you got to say against this plan ? My wife is just as full of it as me . Come ! begin with your objections . You 're not a woman if you have not a whole bag - full of them ready to turn out against any reasonable proposal . "
185222	185228	185230	185230	Ruth	87	" I do n't know , "
185232	185237	185230	185230	Ruth	87	" It is so sudden "
185238	185251	185253	185254	Miss Benson	149	" It is very , very kind of you , Mr Davis , "
185268	185304	184984	184984	he	4166	" Pooh ! pooh ! I 'll answer for it , in the long run , I am taking good care of my own interests . Come , Mrs Denbigh , is it a bargain ? "
185310	185361	185306	185307	Mr Benson	149	" Mr Davis , it is rather sudden , as she says . As far as I can see , it is the best as well as the kindest proposal that could have been made ; but I think we must give her a little time to think about it . "
185362	185374	185375	185375	Ruth	87	" Well , twenty - four hours ! Will that do ? "
185381	185395	185396	185396	she	87	" Mr Davis , I am not ungrateful because I ca n't thank you "
185403	185432	185396	185396	she	87	" let me have a fortnight to consider about it . In a fortnight I will make up my mind . Oh , how good you all are ! "
185433	185554	185306	185307	Mr Benson	149	" Very well . Then this day fortnight Thursday the 28th you will let me know your decision . Mind ! if it 's against me , I sha n't consider it a decision , for I 'm determined to carry my point . I 'm not going to make Mrs Denbigh blush , Mr Benson , by telling you , in her presence , of all I have observed about her this last three weeks , that has made me sure of the good qualities I shall find in this boy of hers . I was watching her when she little thought it . Do you remember that night when Hector O'Brien was so furiously delirious , Mrs Denbigh ? "
185563	185644	185306	185307	Mr Benson	149	" Why now , look there ! how pale she is at the very thought of it . And yet , I assure you , she was the one to go up and take the piece of glass from him which he had broken out of the window for the sole purpose of cutting his throat , or the throat of any one else , for that matter . I wish we had some others as brave as she is . "
185645	185655	185657	185658	Mr Benson	149	" I thought the great panic was passed away ! "
185660	185704	185306	185307	Mr Benson	149	" Aye ! the general feeling of alarm is much weaker ; but , here and there , there are as great fools as ever . Why , when I leave here , I am going to see our precious member , Mr Donne "
185705	185709	185711	185711	Ruth	87	" Mr Donne ? "
185713	185931	185711	185711	Ruth	87	" Mr Donne , who lies ill at the Queen 's came last week , with the intention of canvassing , but was too much alarmed by what he heard of the fever to set to work ; and , in spite of all his precautions , he has taken it ; and you should see the terror they are in at the hotel ; landlord , landlady , waiters , servants all ; there 's not a creature will go near him , if they can help it ; and there 's only his groom a lad he saved from drowning , I 'm told to do anything for him . I must get him a proper nurse , somehow or somewhere , for all my being a Cranworth man . Ah , Mr Benson ! you do n't know the temptations we medical men have . Think , if I allowed your member to die now , as he might very well , if he had no nurse how famously Mr Cranworth would walk over the course ! Where 's Mrs Denbigh gone to ? I hope I 've not frightened her away by reminding her of Hector O'Brien , and that awful night , when I do assure you she behaved like a heroine ! "
185959	185974	185941	185941	Ruth	87	" Mr Benson ! will you allow me to speak to Mr Davis alone ? "
186029	186041	186043	186043	she	87	" Mr Davis ! I must go and nurse Mr Bellingham , "
186066	186070	186072	186072	he	276	" Mr Bellingham ? "
186079	186086	186088	186088	she	87	" Mr Donne , I mean , "
186092	186098	186088	186088	she	87	" His name was Bellingham . "
186099	186142	186072	186072	he	276	" Oh ! I remember hearing he had changed his name for some property . But you must not think of any more such work just now . You are not fit for it . You are looking as white as ashes . "
186143	186148	186149	186149	she	87	" I must go , "
186152	186193	186072	186072	he	276	" Nonsense ! Here 's a man who can pay for the care of the first hospital nurses in London and I doubt if his life is worth the risk of one of theirs even , much more of yours . "
186194	186207	186072	186072	he	276	" We have no right to weigh human lives against each other . "
186208	186253	186072	186072	he	276	" No ! I know we have not . But it 's a way we doctors are apt to get into ; and , at any rate , it 's ridiculous of you to think of such a thing . Just listen to reason . "
186254	186263	186265	186265	she	87	" I ca n't ! I ca n't ! "
186274	186285	186287	186287	she	87	" You must let me go , dear Mr Davis ! "
186295	186298	186300	186300	he	4168	" No ! "
186307	186315	186303	186303	his	4168	" I 'll do no such thing . "
186316	186319	186321	186321	she	87	" Listen , "
186335	186350	186321	186321	she	87	" he is Leonard 's father ! Now ! you will let me go ! "
186375	186418	186371	186371	she	87	" You will not tell ! You must not tell ! No one knows , not even Mr Benson , who it was . And now it might do him so much harm to have it known . You will not tell ! "
186419	186427	186429	186429	he	4168	" No ! I will not tell , "
186431	186534	186429	186429	he	4168	" But , Mrs Denbigh , you must answer me this one question , which I ask you in all true respect , but which I must ask , in order to guide both myself and you aright of course I knew Leonard was illegitimate in fact , I will give you secret for secret : it was being so myself that first made me sympathise with him , and desire to adopt him . I knew that much of your history ; but tell me , do you now care for this man ? Answer me truly do you love him ? "
186568	186621	186623	186623	she	4169	" I have been thinking but I do not know I can not tell I do n't think I should love him , if he were well and happy but you said he was ill and alone how can I help caring for him ? how can I help caring for him ? "
186642	186649	186651	186651	she	4169	" He is Leonard 's father , "
186660	186705	186651	186651	she	4169	" He need not know he shall not that I have ever been near him . If he is like the others , he must be delirious I will leave him before he comes to himself but now let me go I must go . "
186706	186748	186651	186651	she	4169	" I wish my tongue had been bitten out before I had named him to you . He would do well enough without you ; and , I dare say , if he recognises you , he will only be annoyed . "
186749	186755	186757	186757	Ruth	87	" It is very likely , "
186761	186855	186651	186651	she	4169	" Annoyed , why ! he may curse you for your unasked - for care of him . I have heard my poor mother and she was as pretty and delicate a creature as you are cursed for showing tenderness when it was not wanted . Now , be persuaded by an old man like me , who has seen enough of life to make his heart ache leave this fine gentleman to his fate . I 'll promise you to get him as good a nurse as can be had for money . "
186856	186859	186861	186861	Ruth	87	" No ! "
186876	186890	186868	186868	she	87	" I must go . I will leave him before he recognises me . "
186891	186896	186898	186900	the old surgeon	4172	" Why , then , "
186902	187024	186898	186900	the old surgeon	4172	" if you 're so bent upon it , I suppose I must let you . It is but what my mother would have done poor , heart - broken thing ! However , come along , and let us make the best of it . It saves me a deal of trouble , I know ; for , if I have you for a right hand , I need not worry myself continually with wondering how he is taken care of . Go ! get your bonnet , you tender - hearted fool of a woman ! Let us get you out of the house without any more scenes or explanations ; I 'll make all straight with the Bensons . "
187025	187036	187037	187037	she	4173	" You will not tell my secret , Mr Davis , "
187042	187084	187086	187086	he	4174	" No ! not I ! Does the woman think I had never to keep a secret of the kind before ? I only hope he 'll lose his election , and never come near the place again . After all , "
187090	187099	187086	187086	he	4174	" I suppose it is but human nature ! "
187145	187149	187151	187151	he	4174	" Come along ! "
187153	187250	187151	187151	he	4174	" If you 're to do any good at all , it must be in these next three days . After that , I 'll ensure his life for this bout ; and mind ! I shall send you home then ; for he might know you , and I 'll have no excitement to throw him back again , and no sobbing and crying from you . But now every moment your care is precious to him . I shall tell my own story to the Bensons , as soon as I have installed you . "
187361	187419	187329	187329	He	233	" Oh ! if that doctor would but come ! He 'll kill himself or me and them stupid servants wo n't stir a step over the threshold ; how shall I get over the night ? Blessings on him here 's the old doctor back again ! I hear him creaking and scolding up the stairs ! "
187433	187469	187431	187431	Ruth	87	" Here 's the nurse , my good man such a nurse as there is not in the three counties . Now , all you 'll have to do is to mind what she says . "
187470	187492	187526	187526	She	87	" Oh , sir ! he 's mortal bad ! wo n't you stay with us through the night , sir ? "
187493	187497	187499	187500	Mr Davis	276	" Look there ! "
187525	187525	187526	187526	She	87	"
187604	187610	187612	187613	the doctor	4409	" But I will stay , "
187622	187644	187612	187613	the doctor	4409	" as much on her account as his ! and partly to quieten the fears of this poor , faithful fellow . "
188205	188209	188181	188181	he	4201	" Come here , "
188401	188418	188394	188395	Mr Davis	276	" Do n't you see the change ? He is better ! the crisis is past ! "
188503	188519	188499	188499	he	276	" Where are the water - lilies ? Where are the lilies in her hair ? "
188526	188532	188534	188534	he	276	" He is still rambling , "
188536	188544	188534	188534	he	276	" but the fever has left him . "
188621	188626	188627	188627	she	87	" Take me home , "
188726	188762	188722	188723	Mr Davis	276	" Do n't blame me . Do n't add to my self - reproach . I have killed her . I was a cruel fool to let her go . Do n't speak to me . "
188763	188771	188773	188774	Mr Benson	149	" It may not be so bad , "
188783	188798	188776	188776	himself	149	" She may recover . She surely will recover . I believe she will . "
188799	188819	188820	188821	Mr Davis	276	" No , no ! she wo n't . But by she shall , if I can save her . "
188834	188859	188830	188830	he	149	" I tell you she shall recover , or else I am a murderer . What business had I to take her to nurse him "
188928	189022	188922	188922	his	276	" I could not answer it to Mr Cranworth if I had brought his opponent round , you know , when I had had such a fine opportunity in my power . Now , with your patients , and general Radical interest , it will be rather a feather in your cap ; for he may want a good deal of care yet , though he is getting on famously so rapidly , in fact , that it 's a strong temptation to me to throw him back a relapse , you know . "
189080	189198	189063	189063	he	276	" To be sure , what fools men are ! I do n't know why one should watch and strive to keep them in the world . I have given this fellow something to talk about confidentially to all his patients ; I wonder how much stronger a dose the man would have swallowed ! I must begin to take care of my practice for that lad yonder . Well - a - day ! well - a - day ! What was this sick fine gentleman sent here for , that she should run a chance of her life for him ? or why was he sent into the world at all , for that matter ? "
189229	189239	189228	189228	Ruth	87	" home must go , and take her wages . "
189674	189681	189683	189683	she	87	" I see the Light coming , "
189685	189691	189692	189692	she	87	" The Light is coming , "
189732	189737	189739	189739	he	276	" It is over ! "
189741	189746	189739	189739	he	276	" She is dead ! "
189757	189787	189755	189755	Leonard	110	" Mother ! mother ! mother ! You have not left me alone ! You will not leave me alone ! You are not dead ! Mother ! Mother ! "
189829	189834	189823	189827	one refusing to be comforted	4234	" Mother ! Mother ! "
189956	189971	189972	189972	he	110	" She would have wished it , Leonard ! Do it for her sake ! "
190428	190438	190440	190440	she	154	" Would you like to walk upstairs , sir ? "
190805	190811	190813	190813	he	233	" How beautiful she is ! "
190819	190830	190813	190813	he	233	" Do all dead people look so peaceful so happy ? "
190831	190835	190837	190837	Sally	154	" Not all , "
190841	190857	190837	190837	Sally	154	" Few has been as good and as gentle as she was in their lives . "
190873	190884	190885	190885	he	233	" Come , my good woman ! we must all die "
190901	190935	190936	190936	He	233	" I am sure you loved her very much , and were very kind to her in her lifetime ; you must take this from me to buy yourself some remembrance of her . "
191005	191034	191036	191036	she	154	" And who are you , that think to pay for my kindness to her by money ? And I was not kind to you , my darling , "
191045	191156	191157	191157	She	4268	" I was not kind to you . I frabbed you , and plagued you from the first , my lamb ! I came and cut off your pretty locks in this very room I did and you said never an angry word to me ; no ! not then , nor many a time after , when I was very sharp and cross to you . No ! I never was kind to you , and I dunnot think the world was kind to you , my darling , but you are gone where the angels are very tender to such as you you are , my poor wench ! "
191289	191297	191299	191300	Mr Donne	233	" I must apologise for being here , "
191302	191326	191299	191300	Mr Donne	233	" I was hardly conscious where your servant was leading me to , when she expressed her wish that I should walk upstairs . "
191327	191355	191357	191358	Mr Benson	149	" It is a very common idea in this town , that it is a gratification to be asked to take a last look at the dead , "
191360	191375	191377	191378	Mr Donne	233	" And in this case I am glad to have seen her once more , "
191380	191384	191377	191378	Mr Donne	233	" Poor Ruth ! "
191471	191529	191467	191467	he	149	" I did not recognise her when she came to nurse me ; I believe I was delirious . My servant , who had known her long ago , in Fordham , told me who she was . I can not tell how I regret that she should have died in consequence of her love of me . "
191607	191631	191597	191597	he	149	" I know that money is but a poor compensation , is no remedy for this event , or for my youthful folly . "
191650	191669	191635	191635	his	149	" Indeed , I offered her money to almost any amount before ; do me justice , sir , "
191681	191710	191712	191712	he	149	" I offered to marry her , and provide for the boy as if he had been legitimate . It 's of no use recurring to that time , "
191718	191821	191712	191712	he	149	" what is done can not be undone . But I came now to say , that I should be glad to leave the boy still under your charge , and that every expense you think it right to incur in his education I will defray ; and place a sum of money in trust for him say , two thousand pounds or more : fix what you will . Of course , if you decline retaining him , I must find some one else ; but the provision for him shall be the same , for my poor Ruth 's sake . "
191871	191918	191920	191920	he	149	" Leonard is not unprovided for . Those that honoured his mother will take care of him . He shall never touch a penny of your money . Every offer of service you have made , I reject in his name , and in her presence , "
