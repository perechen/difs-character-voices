4245	4257	4258	4258	Theodore	151	' I read in the New York papers some months ago , '
4269	4299	4258	4258	Theodore	151	' that this h"tel of yours , Mr Babylon , was to be sold to a limited company , but it appears that the sale was not carried out . '
4300	4305	4307	4308	Mr Babylon	153	' It was not , '
4311	4363	4307	4308	Mr Babylon	153	' and the reason was that the middle - men between the proposed company and myself wished to make a large secret profit , and I declined to be a party to such a profit . They were firm ; I was firm ; and so the affair came to nothing . '
4364	4371	4258	4258	Theodore	151	' The agreed price was satisfactory ? '
4372	4375	4307	4308	Mr Babylon	153	' Quite . '
4376	4385	4258	4258	Theodore	151	' May I ask what the price was ? '
4386	4395	4307	4308	Mr Babylon	153	' Are you a buyer , Mr Racksole ? '
4396	4405	4258	4258	Theodore	151	' Are you a seller , Mr Babylon ? '
4406	4410	4412	4412	Babylon	153	' I am , '
4414	4456	4412	4412	Babylon	153	' on terms . The price was four hundred thousand pounds , including the leasehold and goodwill . But I sell only on the condition that the buyer does not transfer the property to a limited company at a higher figure . '
4457	4469	4471	4472	the millionaire	414	' I will put one question to you , Mr Babylon , '
4474	4486	4471	4472	the millionaire	414	' What have your profits averaged during the last four years ? '
4487	4496	4412	4412	Babylon	153	' Thirty - four thousand pounds per annum . '
4497	4501	4503	4504	Theodore Racksole	151	' I buy , '
4509	4526	4503	4504	Theodore Racksole	151	' and we will , if you please , exchange contract - letters on the spot . '
4527	4551	4412	4412	Babylon	153	' You come quickly to a resolution , Mr Racksole . But perhaps you have been considering this question for a long time ? '
4552	4557	4558	4558	Racksole	151	' On the contrary , '
4564	4574	4561	4561	his	151	' I have been considering it for six minutes . '
4588	4597	4598	4598	Racksole	151	' The beauty of being well - known , '
4601	4670	4598	4598	Racksole	151	' is that you need n't trouble about preliminary explanations . You , Mr Babylon , probably know all about me . I know a good deal about you . We can take each other for granted without reference . Really , it is as simple to buy an h"tel or a railroad as it is to buy a watch , provided one is equal to the transaction . '
4671	4674	4676	4677	Mr Babylon	153	' Precisely , '
4680	4722	4676	4677	Mr Babylon	153	' Shall we draw up the little informal contract ? There are details to be thought of . But it occurs to me that you can not have dined yet , and might prefer to deal with minor questions after dinner . '

4737	4756	4731	4732	the millionaire	414	' and in that connexion will you do me a favour ? Will you send for Mr Rocco ? '

4825	4844	4815	4815	he	153	' and if it is quite convenient I should be glad to see him here for a moment . '
4845	4852	4853	4853	Racksole	151	' What do you give Rocco ? '
4856	4868	4815	4815	he	153	' Two thousand a year and the treatment of an Ambassador . '
4869	4883	4815	4815	he	153	' I shall give him the treatment of an Ambassador and three thousand . '

4971	4974	4975	4975	Racksole	151	' Exactly , '
4983	5036	4975	4975	Racksole	151	' Mr Rocco , I wish to acquaint you before any other person with the fact that I have purchased the Grand Babylon H"tel . If you think well to afford me the privilege of retaining your services I shall be happy to offer you a remuneration of three thousand a year . '
5037	5043	4954	4954	Rocco	152	' Tree , you said ? '
5044	5047	4975	4975	Racksole	151	' Three . '
5048	5051	4954	4954	Rocco	152	' Sharmed . '
5052	5117	4975	4975	Racksole	151	' And now , Mr Rocco , will you oblige me very much by ordering a plain beefsteak and a bottle of Bass to be served by Jules - I particularly desire Jules - at table No . 17 in the dining - room in ten minutes from now ? And will you do me the honour of lunching with me to - morrow ? '
5219	5232	5234	5234	Babylon	153	' From what date do you wish the purchase to take effect ? '
5236	5239	5241	5241	Racksole	151	' Oh , '
5244	5258	5241	5241	Racksole	151	' it does n't matter . Shall we say from to - night ? '
5259	5317	5318	5318	He	151	' As you will . I have long wished to retire . And now that the moment has come - and so dramatically - I am ready . I shall return to Switzerland . One can not spend much money there , but it is my native land . I shall be the richest man in Switzerland . '
5327	5336	5338	5338	Racksole	151	' I suppose you are fairly well off ? '
5358	5374	5346	5346	his	151	' Besides what I shall receive from you , I have half a million invested . '
5375	5384	5346	5346	his	151	' Then you will be nearly a millionaire ? '
5389	5398	5400	5400	Racksole	151	' I congratulate you , my dear sir , '
5415	5433	5400	5400	Racksole	151	' Nine hundred thousand pounds , expressed in francs , will sound very nice - in Switzerland . '
5434	5460	5461	5462	Felix Babylon	153	' Of course to you , Mr Racksole , such a sum would be poverty . Now if one might guess at your own wealth ? '
5470	5487	5489	5489	Racksole	151	' I do not know , to five millions or so , what I am worth , '
5514	5523	5461	5462	Felix Babylon	153	' You have had anxieties , Mr Racksole ? '
5524	5551	5494	5494	his	151	' Still have them . I am now holiday - making in London with my daughter in order to get rid of them for a time . '
5552	5565	5461	5462	Felix Babylon	153	' Is the purchase of h"tels your notion of relaxation , then ? '
5571	5579	5580	5580	he	151	' It is a change from railroads , '
5583	5597	5494	5494	his	151	' Ah , my friend , you little know what you have bought . '
5598	5605	5607	5607	Racksole	151	' Oh ! yes I do , '
5609	5621	5607	5607	Racksole	151	' I have bought just the first h"tel in the world . '
5622	5631	5632	5632	Babylon	153	' That is true , that is true , '
5643	5687	5632	5632	Babylon	153	' There is nothing , anywhere , like my h"tel . But you will regret the purchase , Mr Racksole . It is no business of mine , of course , but I can not help repeating that you will regret the purchase . '
5688	5693	5607	5607	Racksole	151	' I never regret . '
5694	5707	5632	5632	Babylon	153	' Then you will begin very soon - perhaps to - night . '
5708	5715	5607	5607	Racksole	151	' Why do you say that ? '
5716	5768	5769	5769	He	153	' Because the Grand Babylon is the Grand Babylon . You think because you control a railroad , or an iron - works , or a line of steamers , therefore you can control anything . But no . Not the Grand Babylon . There is something about the Grand Babylon - '
5775	5783	5607	5607	Racksole	151	' Servants rob you , of course . '
5784	5821	5769	5769	He	153	' Of course . I suppose I lose a hundred pounds a week in that way . But it is not that I mean . It is the guests . The guests are too - too distinguished .

5913	6012	5874	5876	a Dowager Empress	475	' what has become of your shrewdness - that shrewdness which has made your fortune so immense that even you can not calculate it ? Do you not perceive that the roof which habitually shelters all the force , all the authority of the world , must necessarily also shelter nameless and numberless plotters , schemers , evil - doers , and workers of mischief ? The thing is as clear as day - and as dark as night . Mr Racksole , I never know by whom I am surrounded . I never know what is going forward .

6195	6211	6093	6098	someone else in addition to Rocco	485	' No trouble . But it did n't come quite as cheap as you said . '
6212	6220	6093	6098	someone else in addition to Rocco	485	' What do you mean , Father ? '
6221	6236	6093	6098	someone else in addition to Rocco	485	' Only that I 've bought the entire h"tel . But do n't split . '
6237	6258	6093	6098	someone else in addition to Rocco	485	' Father , you always were a delicious parent . Shall you give me the h"tel for a birthday present ? '
6259	6281	6093	6098	someone else in addition to Rocco	485	' No . I shall run it - as an amusement . By the way , who is that chair for ? '

He never for an instant questioned her right to possess her own friends ; he had always left her in the most amazing liberty , relying on her inherited good sense to keep her out of mischief ; but , quite apart from the wink , he was struck by Nella 's attitude towards Mr Dimmock , an attitude in which an amiable scorn was blended with an evident desire to propitiate and please .
6921	6941	6943	6943	Racksole	155	' Nella tells me , Mr Dimmock , that you hold a confidential position with Prince Aribert of Posen , '
6945	6976	6943	6943	Racksole	155	' You will pardon an American 's ignorance , but is Prince Aribert a reigning Prince - what , I believe , you call in Europe , a Prince Regnant ? '
6977	6992	6994	6994	Dimmock	166	' His Highness is not a reigning Prince , nor ever likely to be , '
6996	7016	6994	6994	Dimmock	166	' The Grand Ducal Throne of Posen is occupied by his Highness 's nephew , the Grand Duke Eugen . '
7017	7020	7022	7022	Nella	155	' Nephew ? '
7026	7033	7022	7022	Nella	155	' Why not , dear lady ? '
7034	7043	6994	6994	Dimmock	166	' But Prince Aribert is surely very young ? '
7044	7094	7022	7022	Nella	155	' The Prince , by one of those vagaries of chance which occur sometimes in the history of families , is precisely the same age as the Grand Duke . The late Grand Duke 's father was twice married . Hence this youthfulness on the part of an uncle . '
7095	7139	6994	6994	Dimmock	166	' How delicious to be the uncle of someone as old as yourself ! But I suppose it is no fun for Prince Aribert . I suppose he has to be frightfully respectful and obedient , and all that , to his nephew ? '
7140	7196	7022	7022	Nella	155	' The Grand Duke and my Serene master are like brothers . At present , of course , Prince Aribert is nominally heir to the throne , but as no doubt you are aware , the Grand Duke will shortly marry a near relative of the Emperor 's , and should there be a family - '
7206	7211	7212	7212	he	166	' The Grand Duke , '
7222	7283	7212	7212	he	166	' would much prefer Prince Aribert to be his successor . He really does n't want to marry . Between ourselves , strictly between ourselves , he regards marriage as rather a bore . But , of course , being a German Grand Duke , he is bound to marry . He owes it to his country , to Posen . '
7284	7290	7292	7292	Racksole	155	' How large is Posen ? '
7295	7298	7299	7299	Nella	155	' Father , '
7303	7332	7299	7299	Nella	155	' you should n't ask such inconvenient questions . You ought to have guessed that it is n't etiquette to inquire about the size of a German Dukedom . '
7333	7338	7340	7340	Dimmock	166	' I am sure , '
7347	7391	7340	7340	Dimmock	166	' that the Grand Duke is as much amused as anyone at the size of his territory . I forget the exact acreage , but I remember that once Prince Aribert and myself walked across it and back again in a single day . '
7392	7419	7299	7299	Nella	155	' Then the Grand Duke can not travel very far within his own dominions ? You may say that the sun does set on his empire ? '
7420	7424	7426	7426	Dimmock	166	' It does , '
7428	7435	7436	7436	Nella	155	' Unless the weather is cloudy , '
7440	7452	7436	7436	Nella	155	' Is the Grand Duke content always to stay at home ? '
7453	7470	7436	7436	Nella	155	' On the contrary , he is a great traveller , much more so than Prince Aribert .
7507	7507	7436	7436	Nella	155	'
7508	7512	7514	7514	Nella	155	' In London ? '
7516	7519	7436	7436	Nella	155	' Yes . '
7520	7525	7436	7436	Nella	155	' In this h"tel ? '
7526	7529	7436	7436	Nella	155	' Yes . '
7530	7536	7436	7436	Nella	155	' Oh ! How lovely ! '
7537	7556	7436	7436	Nella	155	' That is why your humble servant is here to - night - a sort of advance guard . '
7557	7562	7436	7436	Nella	155	' But I understood , '
7566	7581	7563	7563	Racksole	155	' that you were - er - attached to Prince Aribert , the uncle . '
7582	7621	7436	7436	Nella	155	' I am . Prince Aribert will also be here . The Grand Duke and the Prince have business about important investments connected with the Grand Duke 's marriage settlement .... In the highest quarters , you understand . '
7622	7629	7631	7631	Racksole	155	' For so discreet a person , '
7633	7639	7631	7631	Racksole	155	' you are fairly communicative . '
7645	7654	7641	7641	he	512	' Shall we go out on the terrace ? '
7672	7681	7683	7683	Jules	147	' Just come , sir , by messenger , '
7695	7711	7712	7712	she	155	' Leave me alone with this boy a little - there 's a dear parent , '
7718	7729	7730	7730	Racksole	155	' I am a mere cypher , an obedient nobody , '
7738	7758	7730	7730	Racksole	155	' Treat me as such . Use me as you like . I will go and look after my h"tel '
8038	8046	8048	8051	the urbane Mr Babylon	153	' Have a cigar , Mr Racksole , '
8053	8065	8048	8051	the urbane Mr Babylon	153	' and a mouthful of the oldest cognac in all Europe . '
8322	8326	8327	8327	he	151	' Great Scott ! '
8330	8353	8327	8327	he	151	' It 's three o'clock . Mr Babylon , accept my apologies for having kept you up to such an absurd hour . '
8354	8387	8683	8683	They	541	' I have not spent so pleasant an evening for many years . You have let me ride my hobby to my heart 's content . It is I who should apologize . '
8391	8401	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' I should like to ask you one question , '
8405	8417	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' Have you ever had anything to do with h"tels before ? '
8418	8421	8423	8423	Racksole	151	' Never , '
8425	8484	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' Then you have missed your vocation . You could have been the greatest of all h"tel - managers . You would have been greater than me , and I am unequalled , though I keep only one h"tel , and some men have half a dozen . Mr Racksole , why have you never run an h"tel ? '
8485	8489	8490	8490	he	151	' Heaven knows , '
8493	8502	8490	8490	he	151	' but you flatter me , Mr Babylon . '
8503	8543	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' I ? Flatter ? You do not know me . I flatter no one , except , perhaps , now and then an exceptionally distinguished guest . In which case I give suitable instructions as to the bill . '
8544	8566	8490	8490	he	151	' Speaking of distinguished guests , I am told that a couple of German princes are coming here to - morrow . '
8567	8572	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' That is so . '
8573	8599	8490	8490	he	151	' Does one do anything ? Does one receive them formally - stand bowing in the entrance - hall , or anything of that sort ? '
8600	8682	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' Not necessarily . Not unless one wishes . The modern h"tel proprietor is not like an innkeeper of the Middle Ages , and even princes do not expect to see him unless something should happen to go wrong . As a matter of fact , though the Grand Duke of Posen and Prince Aribert have both honoured me by staying here before , I have never even set eyes on them . You will find all arrangements have been made . '
8696	8716	8691	8691	Racksole	151	' Let me see you to your room . The lifts will be closed and the place will be deserted .
8725	8734	8403	8403	Babylon	153	' and Mr Babylon pointed to an inner door .
8735	8740	8742	8742	Racksole	151	' No , thanks , '
8744	8761	8742	8742	Racksole	151	' let me explore my own h"tel unaccompanied . I believe I can discover my room . '
8853	9161	9174	9175	Felix Babylon	153	' sake , to build staircases , they are tucked away in remote corners where their presence is not likely to offend the eye of a spoiled and cosmopolitan public . The h"tel seemed vast , uncanny , deserted . An electric light glowed here and there at long intervals . On the thick carpets , Racksole 's thinly - shod feet made no sound , and he wandered at ease to and fro , rather amused , rather struck by the peculiar senses of night and mystery which had suddenly come over him . He fancied he could hear a thousand snores peacefully descending from the upper realms . At length he found a staircase , a very dark and narrow one , and presently he was on the first floor . He soon discovered that the numbers of the rooms on this floor did not get beyond seventy . He encountered another staircase and ascended to the second floor . By the decoration of the walls he recognized this floor as his proper home , and as he strolled through the long corridor he whistled a low , meditative whistle of satisfaction . He thought he heard a step in the transverse corridor , and instinctively he obliterated himself in a recess which held a service - cabinet and a chair . He did hear a step . Peeping cautiously out , he perceived , what he had not perceived previously , that a piece of white ribbon had been tied round the handle of the door of one of the bedrooms . Then a man came round the corner of the transverse corridor , and Racksole drew back . It was Jules - Jules with his hands in his pockets and a slouch hat over his eyes , but in other respects attired as usual .
9347	9352	9354	9354	Racksole	151	' This is quaint , '
9356	9362	9354	9354	Racksole	151	' quaint to a degree ! '
9382	9386	9377	9377	he	151	' Well , I 'm
9391	9395	9377	9377	he	151	' he murmured wonderingly .
9488	9495	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' One word , my friend , '
9532	9535	9537	9537	Jules	147	' Sir ? '
9539	9561	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' I just want to be informed , what the deuce you were doing in No . 111 a moment ago . '
9562	9571	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' I had been requested to go there , '
9577	9617	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' You are a liar , and not a very clever one . That is my daughter 's room . Now - out with it , before I decide whether to shoot you or throw you into the street . '
9618	9633	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' Excuse me , sir , No . 111 is occupied by a gentleman . '
9634	9683	9496	9497	the millionaire	414	' I advise you that it is a serious error of judgement to contradict me , my friend . Do n't do it again . We will go to the room together , and you shall prove that the occupant is a gentleman , and not my daughter . '
9684	9689	9691	9691	Jules	147	' Impossible , sir , '
9693	9697	9702	9702	he	151	' Scarcely that , '
9747	9753	9755	9755	Racksole	151	' Now open the door , '
9762	9767	9755	9755	Racksole	151	' I must knock . '
9768	9790	9755	9755	Racksole	151	' That is just what you must n't do . Open it . No doubt you have your pass - key . '
9832	9844	9846	9846	Jules	147	' A visitor , who insists on seeing you , sir , '
9871	9888	9823	9823	Racksole	151	' Hello , my dear Mr Racksole , this is an unexpected - ah - pleasure . '
9889	9900	9851	9853	Mr Reginald Dimmock	166	' Where is my daughter ? This is her room . '
9901	9912	9823	9823	Racksole	151	' Did I catch what you said , Mr Racksole ? '
9913	9926	9851	9853	Mr Reginald Dimmock	166	' I venture to remark that this is Miss Racksole 's room . '
9927	9932	9934	9934	Dimmock	166	' My good sir , '
9936	9947	9934	9934	Dimmock	166	' you must be mad to dream of such a thing .
9967	9967	9955	9955	me	0	'
9986	9991	9992	9992	he	166	' With your permission , '
10000	10014	9992	9992	he	166	' I will examine the dressing - room and the bath - room . '
10015	10023	10024	10024	Dimmock	166	' Just listen to me a moment , '
10032	10044	10049	10049	he	166	' I 'll listen to you afterwards , my young friend , '
10069	10138	10049	10049	he	166	' Lest my attitude might be open to misconstruction , Mr Dimmock , I may as well tell you that I have the most perfect confidence in my daughter , who is as well able to take care of herself as any woman I ever met , but since you entered it there have been one or two rather mysterious occurrences in this h"tel . That is all . '
10154	10158	10159	10159	he	151	' For instance , '
10162	10178	10159	10159	he	151	' I perceive that this window is broken , badly broken , and from the outside .
10187	10187	10159	10159	he	151	'
10188	10199	10203	10203	his	166	' If you will kindly hear reason , Mr Racksole , '
10208	10245	10246	10246	He	166	' I will endeavour to explain things to you . I regarded your first question to me when you entered my room as being offensively put , but I now see that you had some justification . '
10250	10423	10246	10246	He	166	' I was passing along this corridor about eleven o'clock , when I found Miss Racksole in a difficulty with the h"tel servants . Miss Racksole was retiring to rest in this room when a large stone , which must have been thrown from the Embankment , broke the window , as you see . Apart from the discomfort of the broken window , she did not care to remain in the room . She argued that where one stone had come another might follow . She therefore insisted on her room being changed . The servants said that there was no other room available with a dressing - room and bath - room attached , and your daughter made a point of these matters . I at once offered to exchange apartments with her . She did me the honour to accept my offer . Our respective belongings were moved - and that is all . Miss Racksole is at this moment , I trust , asleep in No . 124 . '
10447	10451	10453	10453	Racksole	151	' Come in , '
10481	10516	10456	10456	Someone	575	' Miss Racksole 's compliments , and a thousand excuses , but a book of hers was left on the mantelshelf in this room . She can not sleep , and wishes to read . '
10517	10530	10532	10532	Racksole	151	' Mr Dimmock , I tender my apologies - my formal apologies , '
10544	10548	10532	10532	Racksole	151	' Good night . '
10549	10556	10558	10558	Dimmock	166	' Pray do n't mention it , '
10587	10602	10586	10586	Jules	147	' wink . Then there was the ribbon on the door - handle and Jules '
10671	10683	10685	10685	Babylon	153	' I have emptied my private room of all personal papers , '
10687	10695	10685	10685	Babylon	153	' and it is now at your disposal .
10773	10773	10946	10946	You	151	'
10774	10784	10786	10787	the millionaire	414	' I shall be delighted if you will stay , '
10789	10806	10786	10787	the millionaire	414	' but it must be as my guest , not as the guest of the h"tel . '
10807	10813	10946	10946	You	151	' You are very kind . '
10814	10844	10786	10787	the millionaire	414	' As for wishing to consult you , no doubt I shall have need to do so , but I must say that the show seems to run itself . '
10845	10848	10850	10850	Babylon	153	' Ah ! '
10853	10900	10850	10850	Babylon	153	' I have heard of h"tels that run themselves . If they do , you may be sure that they obey the laws of gravity and run downwards . You will have your hands full . For example , have you yet heard about Miss Spencer ? '
10901	10904	10906	10906	Racksole	151	' No , '
10908	10913	10906	10906	Racksole	151	' What of her ? '
10914	10945	10946	10946	You	151	' She has mysteriously vanished during the night , and nobody appears to be able to throw any light on the affair . Her room is empty , her boxes gone .
10966	10966	10946	10946	You	151	'
10967	10970	10971	10971	Racksole	151	' H'm ! '
10978	10992	10971	10971	Racksole	151	' Hers is not the only post that falls vacant to - day . '
11013	11018	11019	11019	he	414	' I want Jules , '
11040	11046	11048	11048	his	414	' Good morning , Jules , '
11058	11064	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' Good morning , sir . '
11065	11070	11048	11048	his	414	' Take a chair . '
11071	11077	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' Thank you , sir . '
11078	11088	11048	11048	his	414	' We have met before this morning , Jules . '
11089	11097	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' Yes , sir , at 3 a.m. '
11098	11111	11113	11113	Racksole	151	' Rather strange about Miss Spencer 's departure , is it not ? '
11115	11122	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' It is remarkable , sir . '
11123	11145	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' You are aware , of course , that Mr Babylon has transferred all his interests in this h"tel to me ? '
11146	11157	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' I have been informed to that effect , sir . '
11158	11173	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' I suppose you know everything that goes on in the h"tel , Jules ? '
11174	11194	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' As the head waiter , sir , it is my business to keep a general eye on things . '
11195	11207	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' You speak very good English for a foreigner , Jules . '
11208	11262	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' For a foreigner , sir ! I am an Englishman , a Hertfordshire man born and bred . Perhaps my name has misled you , sir . I am only called Jules because the head waiter of any really high - class h"tel must have either a French or an Italian name . '
11263	11267	11269	11269	Racksole	151	' I see , '
11271	11284	11269	11269	Racksole	151	' I think you must be rather a clever person , Jules . '
11285	11296	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' That is not for me to say , sir . '
11297	11310	11269	11269	Racksole	151	' How long has the h"tel enjoyed the advantage of your services ? '
11311	11318	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' A little over twenty years . '
11319	11363	11269	11269	Racksole	151	' That is a long time to be in one place . Do n't you think it 's time you got out of the rut ? You are still young , and might make a reputation for yourself in another and wider sphere . '
11378	11388	11364	11364	Racksole	151	' You are n't satisfied with me , sir ? '
11389	11440	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' To be frank , Jules , I think - I think you - er - wink too much . And I think that it is regrettable when a head waiter falls into a habit of taking white ribbons from the handles of bedroom doors at three in the morning . '
11445	11486	11030	11030	Racksole	151	' I see how it is , sir . You wish me to go , and one pretext , if I may use the term , is as good as another . Very well , I ca n't say that I 'm

11547	11571	11542	11543	The millionaire	414	' What wages do you require in lieu of notice ? It is my intention that you leave the h"tel within an hour . '
11572	11601	11542	11543	The millionaire	414	' I require no wages in lieu of notice , sir . I would scorn to accept anything . And I will leave the h"tel in fifteen minutes . '
11602	11628	11542	11543	The millionaire	414	' Good - day , then . You have my good wishes and my admiration , so long as you keep out of my h"tel . '
11633	11644	11629	11629	Racksole	151	' Good - day , sir . And thank you . '
11645	11687	11542	11543	The millionaire	414	' By the way , Jules , it will be useless for you to apply to any other first - rate European h"tel for a post , because I shall take measures which will ensure the rejection of any such application . '
11688	11720	11722	11722	Jules	147	' Without discussing the question whether or not there are n't at least half a dozen h"tels in London alone that would jump for joy at the chance of getting me , '

11755	11827	11722	11722	Jules	147	' No , sir . I shall take rooms in Albemarle Street or Jermyn Street , and just be content to be a man - about - town . I have saved some twenty thousand pounds - a mere trifle , but sufficient for my needs , and I shall now proceed to enjoy it . Pardon me for troubling you with my personal affairs . And good - day again . '
11866	11874	11876	11876	Racksole	151	' I mean to settle in England , '

I had my three years at Oxford , like any son of the upper middle class ! It did me good . It has been worth more to me than many successful speculations . It taught me that the English language is different from , and better than , the American language , and that there is something - I have n't yet found out exactly what - in English life that Americans will never get . Why , '

Yes , I shall transfer my securities to London . I shall build a house in Park Lane , and I shall buy some immemorial country seat with a history as long as the A. T. and S. railroad , and I shall calmly and gradually settle down . D'you know - I am rather a good - natured man for a millionaire , and of a social disposition , and yet I have n't six real friends in the whole of New York City . Think of that ! '

14263	14289	14260	14260	she	2578	' That is my secret . Do not seek to penetrate it . Who knows what horrors you might discover if you probed too far ? '

14321	14325	14197	14197	she	2578	' Why not ? '

14359	14368	14197	14197	she	2578	' Because I always get what I want . '
14369	14378	14197	14197	she	2578	' Then you wanted to see me again ? '
14379	14405	14197	14197	she	2578	' Certainly . You interested me extremely . I have never met another man who could talk so well about sculpture as the Count Steenbock . '

14420	14424	14197	14197	she	2578	' Of course . '
14425	14438	14197	14197	she	2578	' That is because your father is so rich , I suppose ? '

14452	14476	14449	14449	she	653	' It 's simply because I always do get what I want . It 's got nothing to do with Father at all . '
14477	14485	14197	14197	she	2578	' But Mr Racksole is extremely wealthy ? '
14486	14523	14449	14449	she	653	' Wealthy is n't the word , Count . There is no word . It 's positively awful the amount of dollars poor Papa makes . And the worst of it is he ca n't help it .

14877	14915	14869	14870	Prince Aribert	167	' Impossible . He is the perfection of health . In three months he will be married . No , I shall never be anything but a Serene Highness , the most despicable of God 's creatures . '

16552	16556	16544	16544	he	151	' Father , you 're
16571	16571	16544	16544	he	151	'
16572	16594	16544	16544	he	151	' Well , my young madame , they 've got me in for one , and you for another ; and they 're
16609	16611	16544	16544	he	151	'em . '
16612	16669	16544	16544	he	151	' Well , Father , you surely did n't expect to keep yourself out of the papers . Besides , as regards newspapers , you ought to be glad you are n't in New York . Just fancy what the dear old Herald would have made out of a little transaction like yours of last night . '
16670	16675	16677	16677	Racksole	151	' That 's true , '
16679	16710	16677	16677	Racksole	151	' But it 'll be all over New York to - morrow morning , all the same . The worst of it is that Babylon has gone off to Switzerland . '
16711	16714	16544	16544	he	151	' Why ? '
16715	16731	16677	16677	Racksole	151	' Do n't know . Sudden fancy , I guess , for his native heath . '
16732	16741	16544	16544	he	151	' What difference does it make to you ? '
16742	16766	16677	16677	Racksole	151	' None . Only I feel sort of lonesome . I feel I want someone to lean up against in running this h"tel . '
16767	16781	16544	16544	he	151	' Father , if you have that feeling you must be getting ill . '
16782	16785	16786	16786	he	151	' Yes , '
16789	16811	16786	16786	he	151	' I admit it 's unusual with me . But perhaps you have n't grasped the fact , Nella , that we 're
16821	16821	16786	16786	he	151	'
16822	16830	16544	16544	he	151	' You mean about poor Mr Dimmock ? '
16831	16960	16786	16786	he	151	' Partly Dimmock and partly other things . First of all , that Miss Spencer , or whatever her wretched name is , mysteriously disappears . Then there was the stone thrown into your bedroom . Then I caught that rascal Jules conspiring with Dimmock at three o'clock in the morning . Then your precious Prince Aribert arrives without any suite - which I believe is a most peculiar and wicked thing for a Prince to do - and moreover I find my daughter on very intimate terms with the said Prince . Then young Dimmock goes and dies , and there is to be an inquest ; then Prince Eugen and his suite , who were expected here for dinner , fail to turn up at all - '
16961	16968	16544	16544	he	151	' Prince Eugen has not come ? '
16969	17002	16786	16786	he	151	' He has not ; and Uncle Aribert is in a deuce of a stew about him , and telegraphing all over Europe . Altogether , things are working up pretty lively . '
17003	17021	16544	16544	he	151	' Do you really think , Dad , there was anything between Jules and poor Mr Dimmock ? '
17022	17050	16786	16786	he	151	' Think ! I know ! I tell you I saw that scamp give Dimmock a wink last night at dinner that might have meant - well ! '
17051	17063	16544	16544	he	151	' So you caught that wink , did you , Dad ? '
17064	17070	16786	16786	he	151	' Why , did you ? '
17071	17086	16544	16544	he	151	' Of course , Dad . I was going to tell you about it . '
17091	17097	17098	17098	Nella	155	' Look here , Father , '
17111	17116	17117	17117	She	155	' Who 's that ? '
17152	17159	17117	17117	She	155	' Well , who is it ? '
17160	17166	17117	17117	She	155	' Is n't it Jules ? '
17167	17180	17117	17117	She	155	' Gemini ! By the beard of the prophet , it is ! '
17181	17193	17117	17117	She	155	' Perhaps Mr Jules is a guest of Mrs Sampson Levi . '
17194	17217	17117	17117	She	155	' Guest or no guest , he goes out of this h"tel , even if I have to throw him out myself . '
17362	17369	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Good evening , Mr Racksole , '
17374	17382	17371	17371	Jules	147	' I must apologize for being here . '
17383	17391	17393	17394	Theodore Racksole	151	' Force of habit , I suppose , '
17397	17403	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Just so , sir . '
17404	17418	17371	17371	Jules	147	' I fancied I had forbidden you to re - enter this h"tel ? '
17419	17447	17371	17371	Jules	147	' I thought your order applied only to my professional capacity . I am here to - night as the guest of Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi . '
17448	17462	17371	17371	Jules	147	' In your new r"le of man - about - town , eh ? '
17463	17466	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Exactly . '
17467	17484	17371	17371	Jules	147	' But I do n't allow men - about - town up here , my friend . '
17485	17495	17371	17371	Jules	147	' For being up here I have already apologized . '
17496	17515	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Then , having apologized , you had better depart ; that is my disinterested advice to you . '
17516	17522	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Good night , sir . '
17523	17574	17371	17371	Jules	147	' And , I say , Mr Jules , if Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi , or any other Hebrews or Christians , should again invite you to my h"tel you will oblige me by declining the invitation . You 'll find that will be the safest course for you . '
17575	17581	17371	17371	Jules	147	' Good night , sir . '
17791	17797	17798	17798	he	151	' Whose luggage is that ? '
17845	17847	17802	17804	The luggage clerk	769	' expressed '
17965	17977	17979	17979	Racksole	151	' I thought Mr Dimmock 's remains were removed last night , '
17982	17998	17999	18000	The inspector	774	' No , sir . The fact is the van was engaged on another job . '
18082	18085	18087	18087	Racksole	151	' Well ? '
18108	18117	18118	18118	he	151	' I see a coffin has been obtained , '
18121	18124	18125	18125	He	151	' Quite right '
18129	18134	18135	18135	he	151	' It 's empty , '
18139	18143	18145	18146	the inspector	774	' Just so , '
18148	18156	18145	18146	the inspector	774	' The body of the deceased has disappeared .
18192	18192	18183	18183	he	167	'
18193	18200	18202	18203	the Prince	2578	' Indeed , I can not ! '
18227	18231	18219	18219	he	2578	' Well , I 'm
18233	18239	18219	18219	he	2578	' murmured Racksole , and stopped .
18683	18685	18694	18694	he	151	' boss '
18968	18974	18975	18975	she	425	' Good morning , Prince , '
18979	18988	18975	18975	she	425	' Are you mistaking this for Hyde Park ? '
18994	19003	19004	19004	he	2578	' I usually walk here in the mornings , '
19007	19012	19013	19013	she	425	' You surprise me , '
19016	19073	19013	19013	she	425	' I thought I was the only person in London who preferred the Embankment , with this view of the river , to the dustiness of Hyde Park . I ca n't imagine how it is that London will never take exercise anywhere except in that ridiculous Park . Now , if they had Central Park - '
19074	19087	19088	19088	he	2578	' I think the Embankment is the finest spot in all London , '
19107	19120	19121	19121	she	425	' I do believe we are kindred spirits , you and I , '
19127	19133	19121	19121	she	425	' Au revoir , Prince ! '
19134	19141	19142	19142	His	2578	' One moment , Miss Racksole . '
19151	19158	19159	19159	she	425	' I am in a hurry , '
19162	19181	19159	19159	she	425	' I am not merely taking exercise this morning . You have no idea how busy we are . '
19182	19202	19121	19121	she	425	' Ah ! then I will not trouble you . But I leave the Grand Babylon to - night . '
19203	19207	19208	19208	she	425	' Do you ? '
19211	19248	19208	19208	she	425	' Then will your Highness do me the honour of lunching with me today in Father 's room ? Father will be out - he is having a day in the City with some stockbroking persons . '
19249	19255	19257	19258	the Prince	2578	' I shall be charmed , '
19337	19344	19345	19345	she	824	' Good - bye , Prince , '
19348	19360	19345	19345	she	824	' but I thought - that is , no I did n't .
19365	19365	19345	19345	she	824	'
19366	19397	19328	19328	he	2578	' You thought I wished to discuss something with you . I did ; but I have decided that I have no right to burden your mind with my affairs . '
19398	19409	19345	19345	she	824	' But suppose - suppose I wish to be burdened ? '
19410	19417	19328	19328	he	2578	' That is your good nature . '
19418	19422	19423	19423	she	824	' Sit down , '
19427	19441	19423	19423	she	824	' and tell me everything ; mind , everything . I adore secrets . '
19457	19467	19468	19468	he	2578	' Why should I weary you with my confidences ? '
19471	19838	19468	19468	he	2578	' I do n't know , I can not tell ; but I feel that I must . I feel that you will understand me better than anyone else in the world . And yet why should you understand me ? Again , I do n't know . Miss Racksole , I will disclose to you the whole trouble in a word . Prince Eugen , the hereditary Grand Duke of Posen , has disappeared . Four days ago I was to have met him at Ostend . He had affairs in London . He wished me to come with him . I sent Dimmock on in front , and waited for Eugen . He did not arrive . I telegraphed back to Cologne , his last stopping - place , and I learned that he had left there in accordance with his programme ; I learned also that he had passed through Brussels . It must have been between Brussels and the railway station at Ostend Quay that he disappeared . He was travelling with a single equerry , and the equerry , too , has vanished . I need not explain to you , Miss Racksole , that when a person of the importance of my nephew contrives to get lost one must proceed cautiously . One can not advertise for him in the London Times . Such a disappearance must be kept secret . The people at Posen and at Berlin believe that Eugen is in London , here , at this h"tel ; or , rather , they did so believe . But this morning I received a cypher telegram from - from His Majesty the Emperor , a very peculiar telegram , asking when Eugen might be expected to return to Posen , and requesting that he should go first to Berlin . That telegram was addressed to myself . Now , if the Emperor thought that Eugen was here , why should he have caused the telegram to be addressed to me ? I have hesitated for three days , but I can hesitate no longer . I must myself go to the Emperor and acquaint him with the facts . '
19839	19852	19853	19853	Nella	155	' I suppose you 've just got to keep straight with him ? '
19868	19889	19862	19862	she	155	' The Emperor is your chief , is he not ? " First among equals " , you call him . '
19890	19899	19901	19901	Aribert	167	' His Majesty is our over - lord , '
19904	19923	19924	19924	she	155	' Why do you not take immediate steps to inquire as to the whereabouts of your Royal nephew ? '
19940	19990	19862	19862	she	155	' Because one of two things may have happened . Either Eugen may have been , in plain language , abducted , or he may have had his own reasons for changing his programme and keeping in the background - out of reach of telegraph and post and railways . '
19991	19997	20066	20066	Nella	155	' What sort of reasons ? '
19998	20014	20015	20015	He	167	' Do not ask me . In the history of every family there are passages - '
20018	20031	20066	20066	Nella	155	' And what was Prince Eugen 's object in coming to London ? '
20035	20038	20039	20039	he	167	' Money , '
20044	20060	20039	20039	he	167	' As a family we are very poor - poorer than anyone in Berlin suspects . '
20061	20065	20066	20066	Nella	155	' Prince Aribert , '
20069	20078	20066	20066	Nella	155	' shall I tell you what I think ? '
20127	20132	20133	20133	he	167	' If you will , '
20136	20146	20097	20097	His	167	' Prince Eugen is the victim of a plot . '
20147	20152	20097	20097	His	167	' You think so ? '
20153	20161	20097	20097	His	167	' I am perfectly convinced of it . '
20162	20177	20097	20097	His	167	' But why ? What can be the object of a plot against him ? '
20178	20192	20193	20193	she	155	' That is a point of which you should know more than me , '
20197	20204	20205	20205	he	167	' Ah ! Perhaps , perhaps , '
20208	20221	20205	20205	he	167	' But , dear Miss Racksole , why are you so sure ? '
20222	20256	20097	20097	His	167	' There are several reasons , and they are connected with Mr Dimmock . Did you ever suspect , your Highness , that that poor young man was not entirely loyal to you ? '
20257	20263	20265	20266	the Prince	2578	' He was absolutely loyal , '
20275	20285	20097	20097	His	167	' A thousand pardons , but he was not . '
20286	20305	20097	20097	His	167	' Miss Racksole , if any other than yourself made that assertion , I would - I would - '
20306	20316	20317	20317	she	155	' Consign them to the deepest dungeon in Posen ? '
20322	20325	20327	20327	she	155	' Listen . '
20346	20367	20327	20327	she	155	' Do you mean , Miss Racksole , that there was an understanding between poor Dimmock and this fellow Jules ? '
20368	20374	20097	20097	His	167	' There was an understanding . '
20375	20378	20327	20327	she	155	' Impossible ! '
20379	20443	20097	20097	His	167	' Your Highness , the man who wishes to probe a mystery to its root never uses the word " impossible " . But I will say this for young Mr Dimmock . I think he repented , and I think that it was because he repented that he - er - died so suddenly , and that his body was spirited away . '
20444	20455	20456	20456	Aribert	167	' Why has no one told me these things before ? '
20459	20466	20467	20467	she	831	' Princes seldom hear the truth , '
20491	20495	20496	20496	he	167	' Miss Racksole , '
20499	20531	20496	20496	he	167	' if you will permit me to say it , I have never in my life met a woman like you . May I rely on your sympathy - your support ? '
20532	20541	20470	20470	He	167	' My support , Prince ? But how ? '
20542	20548	20549	20549	he	167	' I do not know , '
20552	20578	20549	20549	he	167	' But you could help me if you would . A woman , when she has brain , always has more brain than a man . '
20579	20582	20583	20583	she	833	' Ah ! '
20587	20602	20583	20583	she	833	' I have no brains , but I do believe I could help you . '
20657	20662	20663	20663	she	833	' Go to Berlin , '
20666	20712	20663	20663	she	833	' I see that you must do that ; you have no alternative . As for the rest , we shall see . Something will occur . I shall be here . My father will be here . You must count us as your friends . '

21095	21115	20993	20993	Nella	155	' Or is it 121 and 122 ? the little old lady remarked quickly , and then bit her lip .

21805	21875	21800	21800	I	0	' she said to herself , and gave a little sigh . She went down to the office and inquired whether the Baroness had given any instructions about dinner . She felt that some plan must be formulated . She wanted to get hold of Rocco , and put him in the rack . She knew now that Rocco , the unequalled , was also concerned in this mysterious affair .

23062	23070	23072	23072	Nella	155	' I want to see Miss Spencer , '
23085	23089	23046	23047	a man	2659	' Miss Spencer ? '

23098	23106	23108	23109	the man	442	' It 's O.K. , I suppose , '
23111	23116	23118	23118	Nella	155	' I guess so , '
23169	23175	23176	23176	she	155	' Well , Miss Spencer , '
23183	23226	23176	23176	she	155	' I guess you did n't expect to see me . You left our h"tel very suddenly this afternoon , and you left it very suddenly a few days ago ; and so I 've just called to make a few inquiries . '
23263	23273	23274	23274	Nella	155	' You have ceased to be the Baroness Zerlinski , '
23277	23283	23274	23274	Nella	155	' May I sit down ? '
23284	23290	23292	23293	Miss Spencer	149	' Certainly , sit down , '
23301	23327	23292	23293	Miss Spencer	149	' You are a fairly smart young woman , that I will say . What do you want ? Were n't my books all straight ? '
23328	23385	23274	23274	Nella	155	' Your books were all straight . I have n't come about your books . I have come about the murder of Reginald Dimmock , the disappearance of his corpse , and the disappearance of Prince Eugen of Posen . I thought you might be able to help me in some investigations which I am making . '
23403	23412	23393	23393	she	149	' You may be a Yankee , but you 're
23416	23419	23393	23393	she	149	' she said .

23502	23513	23470	23470	she	155	' stammered Miss Spencer , in a low , quavering voice .
23514	23518	23525	23525	she	155	' Am I ? '
23544	23632	23525	23525	she	155	' Am I ? You said just now that I might be a Yankee girl , but I was a fool . Well , I am a Yankee girl , as you call it ; and in my country , if they do n't teach revolver - shooting in boarding - schools , there are at least a lot of girls who can handle a revolver . I happen to be one of them . I tell you that if you ring that bell you will suffer . '
23730	23738	23740	23740	Nella	155	' You had better sit down now , '
23742	23752	23740	23740	Nella	155	' and I will ask you a few questions . '
23774	23785	23786	23786	Nella	155	' Why did you leave the Grand Babylon that night ? '
23801	23810	23786	23786	Nella	155	' I had orders to , Miss Racksole . '
23811	23815	23786	23786	Nella	155	' Whose orders ? '
23816	23820	23822	23822	I	0	' Well , I 'm

23867	23888	23851	23852	Tom Jackson	191	' So Jules 's real name is Tom Jackson ? Why did he want you to leave without giving notice ? '

23948	23948	23939	23939	you	149	'
23969	23972	23973	23973	she	155	' Well , '
23976	23985	23973	23973	she	155	' why did he want you to leave ? '
24003	24016	23986	23986	She	155	' I ca n't tell you , I ca n't tell you . '
24017	24024	24025	24025	Nella	155	' You 've just got to , '
24035	24052	24025	24025	Nella	155	' He - he wished me to come over here to Ostend . Something had gone wrong .
24072	24072	24069	24069	he	964	'
24073	24086	24069	24069	he	964	' Had something gone wrong in the h"tel , or over here ? '
24087	24090	24069	24069	he	964	' Both . '
24091	24100	24069	24069	he	964	' Was it about Prince Eugen of Posen ? '
24101	24116	24069	24069	he	964	' I do n't know - that is , yes , I think so . '
24117	24128	24069	24069	he	964	' What has your husband to do with Prince Eugen ? '
24129	24147	24069	24069	he	964	' I believe he has some - some sort of business with him , some money business . '
24148	24157	24069	24069	he	964	' And was Mr Dimmock in this business ? '
24166	24177	24069	24069	he	964	'm telling you all I know , that I swear . '
24178	24194	24069	24069	he	964	' Did your husband and Mr Dimmock have a quarrel that night in Room 111 ? '
24195	24201	24069	24069	he	964	' They had some difficulty . '
24202	24216	24069	24069	he	964	' And the result of that was that you came to Ostend instantly ? '
24217	24224	24069	24069	he	964	' Yes ; I suppose so . '
24225	24245	24069	24069	he	964	' And what were you to do in Ostend ? What were your instructions from this husband of yours ? '
24270	24276	24277	24277	she	155	' Have pity on me , '
24280	24289	24277	24277	she	155	' I ca n't tell you any more . '
24290	24293	24261	24261	Nella	155	' Why ? '
24294	24303	24277	24277	she	155	' He 'd kill me if he knew . '
24304	24306	24261	24261	Nella	155	' You 're
24312	24317	24261	24261	Nella	155	' observed Nella coldly . '

24371	24379	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' I shall die for this anyhow , '
24394	24404	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' I had to keep watch on Prince Eugen . '
24405	24412	24364	24364	you	155	' Where ? In this house ? '
24433	24452	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Then Prince Eugen was a prisoner ? Some one had captured him at the instigation of Jules ? '
24453	24462	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Yes , if you must have it . '
24463	24476	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Why was it necessary for you specially to come to Ostend ? '
24477	24517	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Oh ! Tom trusts me . You see , I know Ostend . Before I took that place at the Grand Babylon I had travelled over Europe , and Tom knew that I knew a thing or two . '
24518	24530	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Why did you take the place at the Grand Babylon ? '
24531	24548	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Because Tom told me to . He said I should be useful to him there . '
24549	24565	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Is your husband an Anarchist , or something of that kind , Miss Spencer ? '
24566	24595	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' I do n't know . I 'd tell you in a minute if I knew . But he 's one of those that keep themselves to themselves . '
24596	24608	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' Do you know if he has ever committed a murder ? '
24611	24623	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' said Miss Spencer , with righteous repudiation of the mere idea .
24624	24665	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' But Mr Dimmock was murdered . He was poisoned . If he had not been poisoned why was his body stolen ? It must have been stolen to prevent inquiry , to hide traces . Tell me about that . '
24666	24673	24675	24676	Miss Spencer	149	' I take my dying oath , '
24687	24709	24675	24676	Miss Spencer	149	' I take my dying oath I did n't know Mr Dimmock was dead till I saw it in the newspaper . '
24710	24720	24381	24382	Miss Spencer	149	' You swear you had no suspicion of it ? '
24721	24728	24675	24676	Miss Spencer	149	' I swear I had n't . '
24816	24823	24824	24824	she	155	' Where is Prince Eugen now ? '
24829	24837	24824	24824	she	155	' I do n't know , miss . '
24838	24846	24824	24824	she	155	' He is n't in this house ? '
24847	24852	24824	24824	she	155	' No , miss . '
24853	24861	24824	24824	she	155	' Ah ! We will see presently . '
24862	24871	24824	24824	she	155	' They took him away , Miss Racksole . '
24872	24885	24824	24824	she	155	' Who took him away ? Some of your husband 's friends ? '
24886	24893	24824	24824	she	155	' Some of his - acquaintances . '
24894	24903	24824	24824	she	155	' Then there is a gang of you ? '
24904	24921	24922	24923	Miss Spencer	149	' A gang of us - a gang ! I do n't know what you mean , '
24926	24934	24936	24936	Nella	155	' Oh , but you must know , '
24939	24971	24975	24977	a Yankee girl	2976	' You ca n't possibly be so innocent as all that , Mrs Tom Jackson . You ca n't play games with me . You 've just got to remember that I 'm
25028	25028	25022	25022	You	970	'
25052	25059	25060	25060	she	155	' How can I tell you , '
25063	25082	25060	25060	she	155	' when I do n't know ? You 've got the whip - hand of me , and you 're
25090	25098	25060	25060	she	155	' She wore an expression of persecuted innocence .
25099	25114	25039	25039	her	155	' Did Mr Tom Jackson want to get some money out of Prince Eugen ? '
25115	25128	25060	25060	she	155	' Money ! Not he ! Tom 's never short of money . '
25129	25146	25039	25039	her	155	' But I mean a lot of money - tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands ? '
25147	25155	25157	25158	Miss Spencer	149	' Tom never wanted money from anyone , '
25161	25178	25039	25039	her	155	' Then had he some reason for wishing to prevent Prince Eugen from coming to London ? '
25179	25199	25200	25200	Nella	155	' Perhaps he had . I do n't know . If you kill me , I do n't know . '
25416	25419	25420	25420	she	155	' Speak , '
25432	25437	25438	25439	the woman	966	' Tom did say , '
25445	25459	25438	25439	the woman	966	' that if Prince Eugen got to London it would upset his scheme . '
25460	25470	25420	25420	she	155	' What scheme ? What scheme ? Answer me . '
25471	25481	25482	25483	Miss Spencer	149	' Heaven help me , I do n't know . '
25489	25509	25482	25483	Miss Spencer	149	' He said Mr Dimmock had turned tail , and he should have to settle him and then Rocco - '
25510	25517	25522	25522	herself	155	' Rocco ! What about Rocco ? '
25547	25557	25558	25558	Her	149	' Do n't ask me . It 's death ! '
25567	25571	25579	25579	her	155	' It is , '
25594	25599	25601	25602	Miss Spencer	149	' It 's death , '
25717	25727	25729	25730	Miss Spencer	149	' I told you that you were a fool , '
25733	25752	25729	25730	Miss Spencer	149	' coming here like a sort of female Jack Sheppard , and trying to get the best of me .

25878	25885	25886	25886	she	155	' I admit you 've won , '
25889	25900	25886	25886	she	155	' but I 've not finished yet . Just listen . '
25916	25968	25904	25904	her	149	' You know my father is a millionaire ; perhaps you know that he is one of the richest men in the world . If I give you my word of honour not to reveal anything that you 've told me , what will you take to let me go free ? '
25969	25976	25978	25979	Miss Spencer	149	' What sum do you suggest ? '
25982	25987	25989	25989	Nella	155	' Twenty thousand pounds , '
26010	26015	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' A hundred thousand . '
26023	26042	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' Well , say a million . I can rely on my father , and so may you . '
26043	26054	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' You think you are worth a million to him ? '
26055	26059	26061	26061	Nella	155	' I do , '
26063	26078	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' And you think we could trust you to see that it was paid ? '
26079	26085	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' Of course you could . '
26086	26097	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' And we should not suffer afterwards in any way ? '
26098	26112	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' I would give you my word , and my father 's word . '
26113	26116	26118	26119	Miss Spencer	149	' Bah ! '
26121	26145	26118	26119	Miss Spencer	149	' how do you know I would n't let you go free for nothing ? You are only a rash , silly girl . '
26146	26161	26004	26005	Miss Spencer	149	' I know you would n't . I can read your face too well . '
26162	26167	26168	26169	Miss Spencer	149	' You are right , '
26173	26191	26168	26169	Miss Spencer	149	' I would n't . I would n't let you go for all the dollars in America . '

27712	27729	27709	27709	he	442	' I had forgotten that to prevent you from falling I had secured you to the chair '
27752	27755	27756	27756	she	155	' Now , '
27762	27770	27756	27756	she	155	' what is the meaning of this ? '
27771	27775	27776	27776	he	442	' You fainted , '
27780	27787	27776	27776	he	442	' Perhaps you do n't remember . '
27872	27889	27862	27862	his	442	' That has nothing to do with my being carried off in this yacht of yours . '
27890	27897	27898	27898	he	442	' It is not my yacht , '
27901	27940	27898	27898	he	442	' but that is a minor detail . As to the more important matter , forgive me that I remind you that only a few hours ago you were threatening a lady in my house with a revolver . '
27941	27948	27862	27862	his	442	' Then it was your house ? '
27949	27960	27961	27961	He	442	' Why not ? May I not possess a house ? '
27964	27984	27985	27985	She	442	' I must request you to put the yacht about at once , instantly , and take me back . '
27991	27994	27995	27995	he	442	' Ah ! '
27998	28023	27995	27995	he	442	' I am afraid that 's impossible . I did n't put out to sea with the intention of returning at once , instantly . '

28048	28072	28045	28045	she	442	' when my father gets to know of this affair , it will be an exceedingly bad day for you , Mr Jackson . '
28073	28084	28152	28152	Nella	155	' But supposing your father does n't hear of it - '
28085	28088	28045	28045	she	442	' What ? '
28089	28096	28152	28152	Nella	155	' Supposing you never get back ? '
28097	28112	28045	28045	she	442	' Do you mean , then , to have my murder on your conscience ? '
28113	28118	28119	28119	he	442	' Talking of murder , '
28122	28143	28119	28119	he	442	' you came very near to murdering my friend , Miss Spencer . At least , so she tells me . '
28144	28151	28152	28152	Nella	155	' Is Miss Spencer on board ? '
28170	28202	28152	28152	Nella	155	' Miss Spencer is not on board . There is no one on board except you and myself and a small crew - a very discreet crew , I may add . '
28203	28221	28119	28119	he	442	' I will have nothing more to say to you . You must take your own course . '
28227	28231	28152	28152	Nella	155	' he said . '

28296	28308	28293	28293	he	191	' and I admire spirit . It is a rare quality . '

28421	28435	28436	28436	Jules	147	' It is no fault of mine that you are in this fix , '
28439	28473	28436	28436	Jules	147	' I did n't bring you into it . You brought yourself into it . You and your father - you have been moving along at a pace which is rather too rapid . '
28474	28481	28482	28482	she	155	' That remains to be seen , '
28487	28491	28492	28492	he	147	' It does , '

You might do worse . Marry me . I am a great man ; I shall be greater . I adore you . Marry me , and I will save your life . All shall be well . I will begin again . The past shall be as though there had been no past . '

He had conducted an elaborate private investigation without result , and he had spent a certain amount of money without result . The police said that they had a clue ; but Racksole remarked that it was always the business of the police to have a clue , that they seldom had more than a clue , and that a clue without some sequel to it was a pretty stupid business . The only sure thing in the whole affair was that a cloud rested over his h"tel , his beautiful new toy , the finest of its kind . The cloud was not interfering with business , but , nevertheless , it was a cloud , and he fiercely resented its presence ; perhaps it would be more correct to say that he fiercely resented his inability to dissipate it .

30193	30258	30187	30191	a man having a grievance	1091	' Yes ; a private detective . It 's a small matter , I know , and I dare say you think you 've got a right , as proprietor of the show , to do what you like in that line ; but I 've just called to tell you that I object . I 've called as a matter of principle . I 'm
30270	30270	30187	30191	a man having a grievance	1091	'

30327	30330	30332	30332	Racksole	151	' Straight , '
30335	30458	30187	30191	a man having a grievance	1091	' There was a gent present at my ball that I did n't ask . I 've got a wonderful memory for faces , and I know . Several fellows asked me afterwards what he was doing there . I was told by someone that he was one of your waiters , but I did n't believe that . I know nothing of the Grand Babylon ; it 's not quite my style of tavern , but I do n't think you 'd send one of your own waiters to watch my guests - unless , of course , you sent him as a waiter ; and this chap did n't do any waiting , though he did his share of drinking . '
30459	30470	30472	30472	Racksole	151	' Perhaps I can throw some light on this mystery , '
30474	30492	30472	30472	Racksole	151	' I may tell you that I was already aware that man had attended your ball uninvited . '
30493	30501	30187	30191	a man having a grievance	1091	' How did you get to know ? '
30502	30542	30472	30472	Racksole	151	' By pure chance , Mr Levi , and not by inquiry . That man was a former waiter at this h"tel - the head waiter , in fact - Jules . No doubt you have heard of him . '
30543	30547	30549	30550	Mr Levi	184	' Not I , '
30553	30556	30558	30558	Racksole	151	' Ah ! '
30560	30605	30558	30558	Racksole	151	' I was informed that everyone knew Jules , but it appears not . Well , be that as it may , previously to the night of your ball , I had dismissed Jules . I had ordered him never to enter the Babylon again .

30680	30688	30689	30691	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' This is perfectly satisfactory to me , '
30698	30737	30739	30739	they	1098	' I only wanted an explanation , and I 've got it . I was told by some pals of mine in the City I might rely on Mr Theodore Racksole going straight to the point , and I 'm
30769	30769	30761	30761	I	0	'
30770	30780	30761	30761	I	0	' I do n't know why I dismissed him . '
30781	30793	30761	30761	I	0	' You do n't know ? Oh ! come now ! I 'm
30820	30824	30761	30761	I	0	'm too inquisitive . '
30825	30864	30761	30761	I	0	' Not at all , Mr Levi ; but I really do n't know . I only sort of felt that he was a suspicious character . I dismissed him on instinct , as it were . See ? '
30874	30886	30887	30887	he	184	' If this Jules is such a well - known person , '
30890	30905	30887	30887	he	184	' how could the feller hope to come to my ball without being recognized ? '
30906	30911	30913	30913	Racksole	151	' Give it up , '
30916	30925	30927	30929	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' Well , I 'll be moving on , '
30934	30952	30927	30929	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' Good day , and thank ye . I suppose you are n't doing anything in Kaffirs ? '
30959	30964	30966	30966	Levi	184	' I thought not , '
30991	30991	30979	30979	I	0	'
30992	30996	30998	30998	Racksole	151	' Good day , '
31038	31049	31027	31028	Theodore Racksole	151	' Strange things been going on here lately , eh ? '
31063	31066	31067	31067	Racksole	151	' Yes , '
31070	31076	31067	31067	Racksole	151	' Know anything about them ? '
31077	31085	31087	31088	Mr Levi	184	' Well - no , not exactly , '
31090	31116	31087	31088	Mr Levi	184	' But I had a fancy you and I might be useful to each other ; I had a kind of fancy to that effect . '
31117	31128	31129	31129	Racksole	151	' Come back and sit down again , Mr Levi , '
31143	31160	31129	31129	Racksole	151	' Now , how can we be of service to each other ? I flatter myself I 'm
31194	31194	31187	31187	I	0	'
31195	31198	31200	31202	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' Agreed , '
31204	31276	31200	31202	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' I 'll begin by explaining my interest in your h"tel . I have been expecting to receive a summons from a certain Prince Eugen of Posen to attend him here , and that summons has n't arrived . It appears that Prince Eugen has n't come to London at all . Now , I could have taken my dying davy that he would have been here yesterday at the latest . '
31277	31284	31187	31187	I	0	' Why were you so sure ? '
31285	31290	31292	31292	Levi	184	' Question for question , '
31294	31350	31292	31292	Levi	184	' Let 's clear the ground first , Mr Racksole . Why did you buy this h"tel ? That 's a conundrum that 's been puzzling a lot of our fellows in the City for some days past . Why did you buy the Grand Babylon ? And what is the next move to be ? '
31351	31358	31360	31360	Racksole	151	' There is no next move , '
31363	31391	31360	31360	Racksole	151	' and I will tell you why I bought the h"tel ; there need be no secret about it . I bought it because of a whim . '
31419	31423	31424	31424	he	151	' I suppose , '
31427	31444	31424	31424	he	151	' you find a difficulty in appreciating my state of mind when I did the deal . '
31445	31450	31452	31453	Mr Levi	184	' Not a bit , '
31455	31503	31452	31453	Mr Levi	184	' I once bought an electric launch on the Thames in a very similar way , and it turned out to be one of the most satisfactory purchases I ever made . Then it 's a simple accident that you own this h"tel at the present moment ? '
31504	31520	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' A simple accident - all because of a beefsteak and a bottle of Bass . '
31521	31524	31526	31528	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' Um ! '
31535	31542	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' To return to Prince Eugen , '
31546	31614	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' I was expecting His Highness here . The State apartments had been prepared for him . He was due on the very afternoon that young Dimmock died . But he never came , and I have not heard why he has failed to arrive ; nor have I seen his name in the papers . What his business was in London , I do n't know . '
31615	31621	31623	31625	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' I will tell you , '
31627	31636	31623	31625	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' he was coming to arrange a loan . '
31637	31642	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' A State loan ? '
31643	31650	31623	31625	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' No - a private loan . '
31651	31655	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' Whom from ? '
31656	31703	31623	31625	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' From me , Sampson Levi . You look surprised . If you 'd lived in London a little longer , you 'd know that I was just the person the Prince would come to . Perhaps you are n't aware that down Throgmorton Street way I 'm
31727	31804	31543	31543	Racksole	151	'm a stockbroker , but my real business is financing some of the little Courts of Europe . Now , I may tell you that the Hereditary Prince of Posen particularly wanted a million , and he wanted it by a certain date , and he knew that if the affair was n't fixed up by a certain time here he would n't be able to get it by that certain date . That 's why I 'm
31812	31812	31806	31806	he	1110	'
31813	31822	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' What did he need a million for ? '
31823	31826	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' Debts , '
31832	31836	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' His own ? '
31837	31840	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' Certainly . '
31841	31851	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' But he is n't thirty years of age ? '
31852	31890	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' What of that ? He is n't the only European Prince who has run up a million of debts in a dozen years . To a Prince the thing is as easy as eating a sandwich . '
31891	31904	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' And why has he taken this sudden resolution to liquidate them ? '
31905	31976	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' Because the Emperor and the lady 's parents wo n't let him marry till he has done so ! And quite right , too ! He 's got to show a clean sheet , or the Princess Anna of Eckstein - Schwartzburg will never be Princess of Posen . Even now the Emperor has no idea how much Prince Eugen 's debts amount to . If he had - ! '
31977	31989	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' But would not the Emperor know of this proposed loan ? '
31990	32004	31543	31543	Racksole	151	' Not necessarily at once . It could be so managed . Twig ? '
32010	32047	32048	32048	he	184	' I 've carried these little affairs through before . After marriage it might be allowed to leak out . And you know the Princess Anna 's fortune is pretty big ! Now , Mr Racksole , '
32056	32107	31828	31829	Sampson Levi	184	' where do you suppose Prince Eugen has disappeared to ? Because if he does n't turn up to - day he ca n't have that million . To - day is the last day . To - morrow the money will be appropriated , elsewhere . Of course , I 'm
32122	32122	32053	32053	his	184	'
32123	32136	32053	32053	his	184	' You ask me where I think Prince Eugen has disappeared to ? '
32137	32141	32053	32053	his	184	' I do . '
32142	32151	32053	32053	his	184	' Then you think it 's a disappearance ? '
32156	32163	32164	32164	he	184	' Putting two and two together , '
32167	32201	32164	32164	he	184	' I do . The Dimmock business is very peculiar - very peculiar , indeed . Dimmock was a left - handed relation of the Posen family . Twig ? Scarcely anyone knows that .
32238	32255	32236	32236	Twig	196	' Mr Sampson Levi always used this extraordinary word when he was in a communicative mood . '
32333	32333	32314	32314	they	415	'
32334	32339	32341	32341	Racksole	151	' Wo n't it ? '
32348	32354	32356	32357	Mr Levi	184	' What do you mean ? '
32359	32418	32314	32314	they	415	' I mean this : Suppose some other European pauper Prince was anxious to marry Princess Anna and her fortune , would n't that Prince have an interest in stopping this loan of yours to Prince Eugen ? Would n't he have an interest in causing Prince Eugen to disappear - at any rate , for a time ? '
32428	32433	32434	32434	he	184	' Mr Theodore Racksole , '
32439	32449	32434	32434	he	184	' I do believe you have hit on something . '
32795	32799	32800	32800	he	151	' Great Scott ! '
32803	32821	32800	32800	he	151	' I 've got hold of something - No . 111 is exactly over the State apartments . '
32884	32911	32851	32851	they	1137	'm not back in three days , begin to inquire for me at Ostend . Till then leave me alone . - Your sagacious daughter , NELL .
32947	32956	32936	32936	He	151	' P.S. - Keep an eye on Rocco . '
32957	32968	32969	32969	he	151	' I wonder what the little creature is up to ? '
33591	33600	33601	33602	the millionaire	414	' What are you doing , M. Rocco ? '
33606	33609	33611	33611	Rocco	199	' Ah ! '
33619	33640	33611	33611	Rocco	199	' Pardon ! I was inventing a new mayonnaise , which I shall need for a certain menu next week . '
33641	33652	33654	33654	Racksole	151	' Do you invent these things without materials , then ? '
33656	33698	33611	33611	Rocco	199	' Certainly . I do dem in my mind . I tink dem . Why should I want materials ? I know all flavours . I tink , and tink , and tink , and it is done . I write down .
33741	33741	33731	33733	De great composers	1176	'
33742	33746	33748	33748	Racksole	151	' I see , '
33750	33767	33768	33768	Rocco	199	' It is because I work like dat dat you pay me three thousand a year , '
33772	33777	33779	33779	Racksole	151	' Heard about Jules ? '
33782	33785	33748	33748	Racksole	151	' Jules ? '
33786	33796	33797	33798	the millionaire	414	' Yes . He 's been arrested in Ostend , '
33807	33828	33797	33798	the millionaire	414	' They say that he and several others are implicated in a murder case - the murder of Reginald Dimmock . '
33829	33832	33834	33834	Rocco	199	' Truly ? '
33862	33909	33910	33910	Racksole	151	' It seems that , after all , the police are good for something . But this is the first time I ever knew them to be worth their salt . There is to be a thorough and systematic search of the h"tel to - morrow , '
33914	33954	33910	33910	Racksole	151	' I have mentioned it to you to warn you that so far as you are concerned the search is of course merely a matter of form . You will not object to the detectives looking through your rooms ? '
33955	33959	33961	33961	Rocco	199	' Certainly not , '
33966	33979	33981	33981	Racksole	151	' I shall ask you to say nothing about this to anyone , '
33983	33988	33981	33981	Racksole	151	' The news of Jules '

34108	34127	34102	34102	he	199	' schemes - and probably in the death of Reginald Dimmock and the disappearance of Prince Eugen of Posen .

36477	36482	36484	36484	Rocco	199	' I give in , '
36486	36542	36484	36484	Rocco	199	' From the moment you entered this cursed h"tel I was afraid of you . I told Jules I was afraid of you . I knew there would be trouble with a man of your kidney , and I was right ; confound it ! I tell you I give in . I know when I 'm
36565	36565	36562	36562	you	1268	'
36712	36715	36704	36704	Racksole	151	' So you 're
36726	36726	36704	36704	Racksole	151	'
36737	36739	36704	36704	Racksole	151	' I 'm
36742	36747	36748	36748	I	0	' answered Rocco quietly . '
36749	36757	36727	36727	Racksole	151	'm a citizen of the United States . '
36758	36764	36765	36765	Racksole	151	' The deuce you are ! '
36768	36860	36727	36727	Racksole	151	' Yes , I was born at West Orange , New Jersey , New York State . I call myself an Italian because it was in Italy that I first made a name as a chef - at Rome . It is better for a great chef like me to be a foreigner . Imagine a great chef named Elihu P. Rucker . You ca n't imagine it . I changed my nationality for the same reason that my friend and colleague , Jules , otherwise Mr Jackson , changed his . '
36861	36873	36727	36727	Racksole	151	' So Jules is your friend and colleague , is he ? '
36874	36910	36727	36727	Racksole	151	' He was , but from this moment he is no longer . I began to disapprove of his methods no less than a week ago , and my disapproval will now take active form . '
36911	36915	36917	36917	Racksole	151	' Will it ? '
36919	36972	36917	36917	Racksole	151	' I calculate it just wo n't , Mr Elihu P. Rucker , citizen of the United States . Before you are very much older you 'll be in the kind hands of the police , and your activities , in no matter what direction , will come to an abrupt conclusion . '
36973	36978	36980	36980	Rocco	199	' It is possible , '
36982	37030	36980	36980	Rocco	199	' In the meantime , I 'll ask you one or two questions for my own private satisfaction . You 've acknowledged that the game is up , and you may as well answer them with as much candour as you feel yourself capable of . See ? '
37031	37035	37037	37037	Rocco	199	' I see , '
37040	37050	37037	37037	Rocco	199	' but I guess I ca n't answer all questions .
37058	37058	37051	37051	I	0	'
37059	37062	37064	37064	Racksole	151	' Well , '
37070	37084	37067	37067	his	151	' what 's the scheme all about ? Tell me in a word . '
37085	37101	37067	37067	his	151	' Not in a thousand words . It is n't my secret , you know . '
37102	37110	37111	37112	The millionaire	414	' Why was poor little Dimmock poisoned ? '
37131	37137	37139	37139	Rocco	199	' I do n't know , '
37141	37183	37139	37139	Rocco	199	' I do n't mind informing you that I objected to that part of the business . I was n't made aware of it till after it was done , and then I tell you it got my dander up considerable . '
37184	37200	37067	37067	his	151	' You mean to say you do n't know why Dimmock was done to death ? '
37201	37269	37139	37139	Rocco	199	' I mean to say I could n't see the sense of it . Of course he - er - died , because he sort of cried off the scheme , having previously taken a share of it . I do n't mind saying that much , because you probably guessed it for yourself . But I solemnly state that I have a conscientious objection to murder . '
37270	37276	37067	37067	his	151	' Then it was murder ? '
37277	37285	37286	37286	Rocco	199	' It was a kind of murder , '
37293	37293	37067	37067	his	151	'
37294	37298	37300	37300	Rocco	199	' Unfair question , '
37302	37315	37067	37067	his	151	' Who else is in this precious scheme besides Jules and yourself ? '
37316	37325	37067	37067	his	151	' Do n't know , on my honour . '
37326	37345	37067	37067	his	151	' Well , then , tell me this . What have you been doing to Dimmock 's body ? '
37346	37355	37356	37356	Rocco	199	' How long were you in that bathroom ? '
37362	37371	37373	37374	Theodore Racksole	151	' Do n't question me , Mr Rucker , '
37376	37409	37373	37374	Theodore Racksole	151	' I feel very much inclined to break your back across my knee . Therefore I advise you not to irritate me . What have you been doing to Dimmock 's body ? '
37410	37417	37067	37067	his	151	' I 've been embalming it . '
37418	37424	37373	37374	Theodore Racksole	151	' Em - balming it . '
37425	37462	37067	37067	his	151	' Certainly ; Richardson 's system of arterial fluid injection , as improved by myself . You were n't aware that I included the art of embalming among my accomplishments . Nevertheless , it is so . '
37463	37467	37469	37469	Racksole	151	' But why ? '
37476	37489	37469	37469	Racksole	151	' Why should you trouble to embalm the poor chap 's corpse ? '
37490	37510	37067	37067	his	151	' Ca n't you see ? Does n't it strike you ? That corpse has to be taken care of .
37707	37707	37694	37694	you	1284	'
37750	37754	37756	37756	Rocco	199	' I hope , '
37763	37793	37756	37756	Rocco	199	' I hope you 'll call in the police without any delay . It 's getting late , and I do n't like going without my night 's rest . '
37794	37807	37808	37808	Racksole	151	' Where do you suppose you 'll get a night 's rest ? '
37811	37828	37756	37756	Rocco	199	' In the cells , of course . Have n't I told you I know when I 'm
37832	37907	37908	37908	He	151	'm not so blind as not to be able to see that there 's at any rate a prima facie case against me . I expect I shall get off with a year or two 's imprisonment as accessory after the fact - I think that 's what they call it . Anyhow , I shall be in a position to prove that I am not implicated in the murder of this unfortunate nincompoop . '
37925	37976	37908	37908	He	151	' And now , shall we go ? Everyone is asleep , but there will be a policeman within call of the watchman in the portico . I am at your service . Let us go down together , Mr Racksole . I give you my word to go quietly . '
37977	37982	37984	37985	Theodore Racksole	151	' Stay a moment , '
37988	38033	37984	37985	Theodore Racksole	151	' there is no hurry . It wo n't do you any harm to forego another hour 's sleep , especially as you will have no work to do to - morrow . I have one or two more questions to put to you . '
38034	38037	38038	38038	Rocco	199	' Well ? '
38053	38060	38038	38038	Rocco	199	' What must be must be . '
38061	38081	37984	37985	Theodore Racksole	151	' Where has Dimmock 's corpse been during the last three or four days , since he - died ? '
38082	38085	38087	38087	Rocco	199	' Oh ! '
38098	38160	38087	38087	Rocco	199	' It 's been in my room , and one night it was on the roof ; once it went out of the h"tel as luggage , but it came back the next day as a case of Demerara sugar . I forgot where else it has been , but it 's been kept perfectly safe and treated with every consideration . '
38161	38169	38175	38175	he	151	' And who contrived all these manoeuvres ? '
38178	38214	38087	38087	Rocco	199	' I did . That is to say , I invented them and I saw that they were carried out . You see , the suspicions of your police obliged me to be particularly spry . '
38215	38222	38329	38329	he	151	' And who carried them out ? '
38223	38263	38087	38087	Rocco	199	' Ah ! that would be telling tales . But I do n't mind assuring you that my accomplices were innocent accomplices . It is absurdly easy for a man like me to impose on underlings - absurdly easy . '
38264	38276	38277	38277	Racksole	151	' What did you intend to do with the corpse ultimately ? '
38285	38289	38291	38291	Rocco	199	' Who knows ? '
38298	38326	38329	38329	he	151	' That would have depended on several things - on your police , for instance . But probably in the end we should have restored this mortal clay '
38334	38342	38329	38329	he	151	' to the man 's sorrowing relatives . '
38343	38352	38329	38329	he	151	' Do you know who the relatives are ? '
38353	38377	38329	38329	he	151	' Certainly . Do n't you ? If you do n't I need only hint that Dimmock had a Prince for his father . '
38378	38384	38386	38386	Racksole	151	' It seems to me , '
38392	38409	38386	38386	Racksole	151	' that you behaved rather clumsily in choosing this bedroom as the scene of your operations . '
38410	38415	38417	38417	Rocco	199	' Not at all , '
38419	38451	38417	38417	Rocco	199	' There was no other apartment so suitable in the whole h"tel . Who would have guessed that anything was going on here ? It was the very place for me . '
38452	38456	38458	38458	Racksole	151	' I guessed , '
38461	38509	38329	38329	he	151	' Yes , you guessed , Mr Racksole . But I had not counted on you . You are the only smart man in the business . You are an American citizen , and I had n't reckoned to have to deal with that class of person . '
38510	38518	38417	38417	Rocco	199	' Apparently I frightened you this afternoon ? '
38519	38525	38329	38329	he	151	' Not in the least . '
38526	38535	38417	38417	Rocco	199	' You were not afraid of a search ? '
38536	38644	38329	38329	he	151	' I knew that no search was intended . I knew that you were trying to frighten me . You must really credit me with a little sagacity and insight , Mr Racksole . Immediately you began to talk to me in the kitchen this afternoon I felt you were on the track . But I was not frightened . I merely decided that there was no time to be lost - that I must act quickly . I did act quickly , but , it seems , not quickly enough . I grant that your rapidity exceeded mine . Let us go downstairs , I beg . '
38667	38671	38673	38673	Racksole	151	' No tricks ! '
38675	38677	38329	38329	he	151	' You 're
38687	38687	38657	38657	Racksole	151	'
38701	38708	38709	38709	he	199	' Have I not informed you , '
38712	38722	38709	38709	he	199	' that I have the intention of going quietly ? '
38746	38754	38756	38756	Racksole	151	' What an ineffable fool you were , '
38764	38804	38756	38756	Racksole	151	' with your talents , your unique talents , to get yourself mixed up in an affair of this kind . You are ruined . And , by Jove ! you were a great man in your own line . '
38805	38809	38811	38811	Rocco	199	' Mr Racksole , '
38815	38846	38811	38811	Rocco	199	' that is the truest word you have spoken this night . I was a great man in my own line . And I am an ineffable fool . Alas ! '
38859	38866	38756	38756	Racksole	151	' Why did you do it ? '
38867	38956	38811	38811	Rocco	199	' I was fascinated - fascinated by Jules . He , too , is a great man . We had great opportunities , here in the Grand Babylon . It was a great game . It was worth the candle . The prizes were enormous . You would admit these things if you knew the facts . Perhaps some day you will know them , for you are a fairly clever person at getting to the root of a matter . Yes , I was blinded , hypnotized . '
38957	38964	38999	38999	Genius	204	' And now you are ruined . '
38965	38984	38811	38811	Rocco	199	' Not ruined , not ruined . Afterwards , in a few years , I shall come up again .
39049	39049	39032	39034	the great Rocco	199	'
39050	39074	39090	39090	Racksole	151	' Let me tell you , as man to man , that you have achieved your own degradation . There is no excuse . '
39075	39080	39082	39082	Rocco	199	' I know it , '
39084	39089	39082	39082	Rocco	199	' Let us go . '
39164	39170	39172	39172	Racksole	151	' It will be locked , '
39174	39184	39172	39172	Racksole	151	' We must use the stairs to - night . '
39185	39197	39199	39199	Rocco	199	' But I have a key . I always carry one , '
39229	39233	39235	39235	Rocco	199	' After you , '
39285	39293	39294	39294	he	199	' Good - bye , Mr Racksole , '
39305	39443	39294	39294	he	199	' Good - bye : I hate to take a mean advantage of you in this fashion , but really you must allow that you have been very simple . You are a clever man , as I have already said , up to a certain point . It is past that point that my own cleverness comes in . Again , good - bye . After all , I shall have no rest to - night , but perhaps even that will be better that sleeping in a police cell . If you make a great noise you may wake someone and ultimately get released from this lift . But I advise you to compose yourself , and wait till morning . It will be more dignified . For the third time , good - bye . '
39644	39649	39651	39652	Detective Marshall	205	' A strange story ! '
39662	39677	39655	39655	he	205	' The climax was unfortunate , but you have certainly got some valuable facts . '
39682	39689	39691	39692	the detective	1317	' I myself have a clue , '
39731	39731	39723	39723	you	151	'
39732	39736	39738	39738	Racksole	151	' With pleasure , '
39755	39767	39750	39750	Racksole	151	' Please come instantly . Nella . H"tel Wellington , Ostend . '
39774	39780	39781	39781	he	151	' I ca n't come , '
39788	39793	39781	39781	he	151	'm going to Ostend . '
39794	39798	39787	39787	I	0	' To Ostend ? '
39799	39804	39781	39781	he	151	' Yes , now . '
39805	39812	39814	39815	the detective	1317	' But really , Mr Racksole , '
39817	39823	39814	39815	the detective	1317	' My business is urgent . '
39824	39829	39831	39831	Racksole	151	' So 's mine , '
39953	39961	39963	39963	Nella	155	' I hope he wo n't die , '
39965	39971	39963	39963	Nella	155	' He looks very white . '
39972	39980	39982	39983	Prince Aribert	167	' The Mr Jacksons of this world , '
39986	40027	39982	39983	Prince Aribert	167	' never die till they are hung . By the way , I wonder how it is that no one has interfered with us . Perhaps they are discreetly afraid of my revolver - of your revolver , I mean . '
40136	40256	40129	40129	He	442	' strict orders not to interfere in any way , no matter what might happen on the deck of the yacht . He was the captain of the yacht , and he had to make for a certain English port , the name of which he could not divulge : he was to keep the vessel at full steam ahead under any and all circumstances . He seemed to be a very big , a very strong , and a very determined man , and the Prince was at a loss what course of action to pursue . He asked several more questions , but the only effect of them was to render the man taciturn and ill - humoured .
40331	40343	40345	40346	the Prince	2578	' It wo n't do to shoot him , I suppose , '
40350	40366	40345	40346	the Prince	2578	' I might bore a hole into his leg , or something of that kind . '
40367	40388	40390	40390	Nella	155	' It 's rather risky , and rather hard on the poor captain , with his extraordinary sense of duty , '
40392	40414	40390	40390	Nella	155	' And , besides , the whole crew might turn on us . No , we must think of something else . '
40415	40423	40425	40426	the Prince	2578	' I wonder where the crew is , '
40477	40485	40486	40486	he	191	' It 's you , is it ? '
40490	40506	40486	40486	he	191	' What are you doing on board ? Who 's tied me up like this ? '
40507	40511	40513	40514	the Prince	2578	' See here ! '
40516	40546	40513	40514	the Prince	2578	' I do n't want to have any arguments , but this yacht must return to Ostend at once , where you will be given up to the authorities . '
40547	40550	40552	40554	Mr Tom Jackson	191	' Really ! '
40556	40560	40552	40554	Mr Tom Jackson	191	' Shall I ! '
40574	40588	40562	40562	he	191	' Hi André ! let these two be put off in the dinghy . '
40637	40644	40646	40646	Nella	155	' Let us take the dinghy , '
40648	40657	40646	40646	Nella	155	' we can row ashore in an hour . '

40871	40876	40877	40877	he	191	' Good - bye , '
40880	40890	40877	40877	he	191	' I shall see you again , never fear . '
41242	41264	41266	41267	the Prince	2578	' I suppose Jules was too surprised and too feeble to inquire how I came to be on board his yacht , '
41273	41280	41284	41284	her	155	' Oh ! How did you ? '
41289	41302	41284	41284	her	155	' Really , I had almost forgotten that part of the affair . '
41303	41317	41319	41320	the Prince	2578	' I must begin at the beginning and it will take some time , '
41322	41335	41319	41320	the Prince	2578	' Had we not better postpone the recital till we get ashore ? '
41336	41345	41347	41347	Nella	155	' I will row and you shall talk , '
41349	41356	41347	41347	Nella	155	' I want to know now . '
41372	41382	41383	41383	he	2578	' Is it not sufficient that I am here ? '
41386	41393	41394	41394	she	155	' It is sufficient , yes , '
41397	41404	41394	41394	she	155	' but I want to know . '
41426	41432	41433	41433	he	2578	' There is no rudder , '
41436	41484	41433	41433	he	2578	' so you must direct me . Keep the boat 's head on the lighthouse . The tide seems to be running in strongly ; that will help us . The people on shore will think that we have only been for a little early morning excursion . '
41485	41506	41507	41507	she	155	' Will you kindly tell me how it came about that you were able to save my life , Prince ? '
41510	41532	41433	41433	he	2578	' Save your life , Miss Racksole ? I did n't save your life ; I merely knocked a man down . '
41533	41539	41540	41540	she	155	' You saved my life , '
41543	41559	41540	41540	she	155	' That villain would have stopped at nothing . I saw it in his eye . '
41560	41576	41577	41577	His	1394	' Then you were a brave woman , for you showed no fear of death . '
41601	41614	41615	41615	he	1394	' It happened that I saw you last night in your carriage , '
41618	41655	41615	41615	he	1394	' The fact is , I had not had the audacity to go to Berlin with my story . I stopped in Ostend to see whether I could do a little detective work on my own account .
41952	41952	41942	41943	two men	662	'
41953	41960	41962	41962	Nella	155	' Who was the other man ? '
41964	42033	41942	41943	two men	662	' I do not know . It was dark . They drove away with you to the harbour . Again I followed . I saw them carry you on board . Before the yacht weighed anchor I managed to climb unobserved into the dinghy . I lay down full length in it , and no one suspected that I was there . I think you know the rest . '
42034	42043	41942	41943	two men	662	' Was the yacht all ready for sea ? '
42044	42066	41942	41943	two men	662	' The yacht was all ready for sea . The captain fellow was on the bridge , and steam was up . '
42067	42078	41942	41943	two men	662	' Then they expected me ! How could that be ? '
42079	42093	41942	41943	two men	662	' They expected some one . I do not think they expected you . '
42094	42103	41942	41943	two men	662	' Did the second man go on board ? '
42104	42128	41942	41943	two men	662	' He helped to carry you along the gangway , but he came back again to the carriage . He was the driver . '
42129	42138	41942	41943	two men	662	' And no one else saw the business ? '
42139	42157	41942	41943	two men	662	' The quay was deserted . You see , the last steamer had arrived for the night . '
42173	42182	42170	42170	her	155	' Truly , it is a wonderful world ! '
42494	42501	42503	42504	the Prince	2578	' And now , what next ? '
42506	42515	42503	42504	the Prince	2578	' I must take you to an h"tel . '
42516	42523	42524	42524	she	155	' I am in your hands , '
42634	42642	42644	42645	the Prince	2578	' I never tasted such excellent chocolate , '
42669	42672	42665	42665	Nella	155	' Nor I. '
42702	42710	42685	42685	she	155	' I must telegraph to Papa instantly . '
42736	42754	42756	42757	Theodore Racksole	151	' THERE is one thing , Prince , that we have just got to settle straight off , '
42866	42871	42873	42874	the Prince	2578	' What is that ? '
42883	42951	42999	42999	Racksole	155	' We have got to settle whether we shall tell the police at once all that has occurred , or whether we shall proceed on our own responsibility . There can be no doubt as to which course we ought to pursue . Every consideration of prudence points to the advisability of taking the police into our confidence , and leaving the matter entirely in their hands . '
42952	42957	42958	42958	Nella	155	' Oh , Papa ! '
42968	42988	42962	42962	her	155	' You surely ca n't think of such a thing . Why , the fun has only just begun . '
42989	42997	42999	42999	Racksole	155	' Do you call last night fun ? '
43006	43012	43013	43013	she	155	' Yes , I do , '
43017	43020	43013	43013	she	155	' Now . '
43021	43028	43038	43038	he	414	' Well , I do n't , '
43049	43061	43063	43064	the Prince	2578	' Do you not think we might investigate a little further , '
43073	43100	43063	43064	the Prince	2578	' just a little further - and then , if we fail to accomplish anything , there would still be ample opportunity to consult the police ? '
43101	43110	43112	43112	Racksole	155	' How do you suggest we should begin ? '
43114	43129	43131	43131	he	2578	' Well , there is the house which Miss Racksole so intrepidly entered last evening '
43141	43156	43131	43131	he	2578	' you and I , Mr Racksole , might examine that abode in detail . '
43157	43162	43131	43131	he	2578	' To - night ? '
43163	43171	43131	43131	he	2578	' Certainly . We might do something . '
43172	43179	43131	43131	he	2578	' We might do too much . '
43180	43184	43131	43131	he	2578	' For example ? '
43185	43221	43131	43131	he	2578	' We might shoot someone , or get ourselves mistaken for burglars . If we outstepped the law , it would be no excuse for us that we had been acting in a good cause . '
43222	43225	43227	43228	the Prince	2578	' True , '
43230	43233	43234	43234	He	2578	' Nevertheless - '
43237	43250	43131	43131	he	2578	' Nevertheless you have a distaste for bringing the police into the business .
43333	43333	43317	43317	I	0	'
43334	43337	43338	43338	she	155	' Papa , '
43341	43350	43338	43338	she	155	' you are perfectly horrid to - night . '
43351	43356	43357	43357	he	2578	' Perhaps I am , '
43360	43414	43357	43357	he	2578	' Decidedly I am very cross with you for coming over here all alone . It was monstrous . If I did n't happen to be the most foolish of parents - There ! Good - night . It 's nine o'clock . The Prince , I am sure , will excuse you . '
43464	43467	43473	43473	his	2578	' Now , '
43476	43483	43473	43473	his	2578	' I fancy that after all I 'm
43561	43566	43556	43556	I	0	' he laughed grimly , '
43597	43597	43590	43590	you	1452	'
43598	43602	43603	43604	the Prince	2578	' I am , '
43607	43620	43603	43604	the Prince	2578	' But Miss Racksole is a young lady of quite remarkable nerve . '
43621	43625	43627	43627	Racksole	155	' She is , '
43630	43638	43627	43627	Racksole	155	' I wish sometimes she had less . '
43639	43649	43651	43652	the Prince	2578	' I have the highest admiration for Miss Racksole , '
43666	43673	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' You honour us , Prince , '
43677	43710	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' Let us come to business . Am I right in assuming that you have a reason for keeping the police out of this business , if it can possibly be done ? '
43711	43714	43716	43717	the Prince	2578	' Yes , '
43724	43749	43720	43720	his	2578	' I am very much afraid that my poor nephew has involved himself in some scrape that he would wish not to be divulged . '
43750	43765	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' Then you do not believe that he is the victim of foul play ? '
43766	43771	43720	43720	his	2578	' I do not . '
43772	43783	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' And the reason , if I may ask it ? '
43784	43917	43720	43720	his	2578	' Mr Racksole , we speak in confidence - is it not so ? Some years ago my foolish nephew had an affair - an affair with a feminine star of the Berlin stage . For anything I know , the lady may have been the very pattern of her sex , but where a reigning Prince is concerned scandal can not be avoided in such a matter . I had thought that the affair was quite at an end , since my nephew 's betrothal to Princess Anna of Eckstein - Schwartzburg is shortly to be announced . But yesterday I saw the lady to whom I have referred driving on the Digue . The coincidence of her presence here with my nephew 's disappearance is too extraordinary to be disregarded . '
43918	43932	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' But how does this theory square with the murder of Reginald Dimmock ? '
43933	43983	43720	43720	his	2578	' It does not square with it . My idea is that the murder of poor Dimmock and the disappearance of my nephew are entirely unconnected - unless , indeed , this Berlin actress is playing into the hands of the murderers . I had not thought of that . '
43984	43996	43674	43674	Racksole	155	' Then what do you propose to do to - night ? '
43997	44017	43720	43720	his	2578	' I propose to enter the house which Miss Racksole entered last night and to find out something definite . '
44018	44022	44024	44024	Racksole	155	' I concur , '
44026	44067	44024	44024	Racksole	155	' I shall heartily enjoy it . But let me tell you , Prince , and pardon me for speaking bluntly , your surmise is incorrect . I would wager a hundred thousand dollars that Prince Eugen has been kidnapped . '
44068	44078	44024	44024	Racksole	155	' What grounds have you for being so sure ? '
44079	44085	44024	44024	Racksole	155	' Ah ! said Racksole , '
44116	44116	44024	44024	Racksole	155	'
44117	44123	44125	44126	Prince Aribert	167	' A million of money ! '
44129	44134	44125	44126	Prince Aribert	167	' It is impossible ! '
44135	44141	44143	44143	Racksole	155	' Nevertheless , he does , '
44159	44168	44169	44169	Racksole	155	' What have you to say to that ? '
44178	44187	44188	44188	Racksole	155	' What have you to say to that ? '
44191	44204	44147	44147	he	1460	' Merely that Eugen is ruined , even if he is alive . '
44205	44210	44211	44211	Racksole	155	' Not at all , '
44216	44241	44211	44211	Racksole	155	' Not at all . We shall see about that . The special thing that I want to know just now from you is this :
44257	44257	44147	44147	he	1460	'
44258	44278	44147	44147	he	1460	' Yes . Last year . The King of Bosnia sued for it , but his proposal was declined . '
44279	44282	44147	44147	he	1460	' Why ? '
44283	44298	44147	44147	he	1460	' Because my nephew was considered to be a more suitable match for her . '
44299	44316	44147	44147	he	1460	' Not because the personal character of his Majesty of Bosnia is scarcely of the brightest ? '
44317	44338	44147	44147	he	1460	' No . Unfortunately it is usually impossible to consider questions of personal character when a royal match is concerned . '
44339	44370	44147	44147	he	1460	' Then , if for any reason the marriage of Princess Anna with your nephew was frustrated , the King of Bosnia would have a fair chance in that quarter ? '
44371	44385	44147	44147	he	1460	' He would . The political aspect of things would be perfectly satisfactory . '
44386	44389	44391	44391	Racksole	155	' Thanks ! '
44393	44438	44391	44391	Racksole	155	' I will wager another hundred thousand dollars that someone in Bosnia - I do n't accuse the King himself - is at the bottom of this business . The methods of Balkan politicians have always been half - Oriental . Let us go . '
44439	44442	44147	44147	he	1460	' Where ? '
44443	44453	44391	44391	Racksole	155	' To this precious house of Nella 's adventure . '
44454	44462	44147	44147	he	1460	' But surely it is too early ? '
44463	44468	44470	44470	Racksole	155	' So it is , '
44472	44502	44470	44470	Racksole	155	' and we shall want a few things , too . For instance , a dark lantern . I think I will go out and forage for a lantern . '
44503	44508	44510	44511	Prince Aribert	167	' And a revolver ? '
44513	44519	44520	44521	The millionaire	414	' Does it mean revolvers ? '
44524	44531	44520	44521	The millionaire	414	' It may come to that . '
44532	44542	44544	44544	Racksole	155	' Here you are , then , my friend , '
44556	44560	44547	44547	he	1463	' And yours ? '
44561	44564	44566	44567	the Prince	2578	' I , '
44569	44576	44566	44567	the Prince	2578	' I have your daughter 's . '
44577	44583	44587	44587	himself	155	' The deuce you have ! '
44618	44627	44628	44628	Racksole	155	' Let us go and see the gambling , '
44631	44639	44628	44628	Racksole	155	' We might encounter the Berlin lady . '
44938	44945	44946	44946	he	151	' This is rather good fun , '
44951	44976	44946	44946	he	151	' but the stakes are too small to make it really exciting . I 'll try my luck , just for the experience . I 'm
44981	44981	44946	44946	he	151	'
44982	44985	44987	44988	the Prince	2578	' Why ? '
44990	45001	45002	45002	Racksole	151	' Because I always do , in games of chance , '
45008	45037	45002	45002	Racksole	151	' It is my fate . Then to - night , you must remember , I shall be a beginner , and you know the tyro 's luck . '
45061	45068	45070	45070	Racksole	151	' What did I tell you ? '
45267	45272	45273	45274	Prince Aribert	167	' You were right , '
45280	45287	45273	45274	Prince Aribert	167	' that is the Berlin lady . '
45288	45304	45273	45274	Prince Aribert	167	' The deuce she is ! Has she seen you ? Will she know you ? '
45305	45320	45273	45274	Prince Aribert	167	' She would probably know me , but she has n't looked up yet . '
45321	45337	45273	45274	Prince Aribert	167	' Keep behind her , then . I propose to find her a little occupation . '
45528	45535	45520	45525	an English spectator at the table	1502	' he could n't do wrong . '
45642	45652	45654	45654	Racksole	151	' It might be well to ascertain her movements , '
45744	45755	45756	45756	he	167	' I feel sure I know where she is going , '
45759	45772	45756	45756	he	167	' and it will be better for us to follow on foot . '
45773	45788	45790	45790	Racksole	151	' You mean she is making for the scene of last night 's affair ? '
45792	45809	45756	45756	he	167	' Exactly . We shall - what you call , kill two birds with one stone . '
45957	45960	45962	45963	the Prince	2578	' Listen , '
45969	45974	45962	45963	the Prince	2578	' they are talking . '
45975	45978	45965	45965	his	2578	' Who ? '
45979	45988	45962	45963	the Prince	2578	' The Berlin lady and Miss Spencer . I 'm
45997	45997	45992	45993	Miss Spencer	149	'
46026	46031	46032	46032	he	151	' Take my place , '
46038	46040	46032	46032	he	151	' they 're
46049	46049	46032	46032	he	151	'
46064	46069	46070	46071	Miss Spencer	149	' Then you refuse ? '
46085	46105	46070	46071	Miss Spencer	149	' Not even a thousand francs ? I tell you I 've lost the whole twenty - five thousand . '
46110	46119	46120	46121	the lady	847	' Then I 'll tell the whole story , '
46132	46172	46120	46121	the lady	847	' I did what I promised to do . I enticed him here , and you 've got him safe in your vile cellar , poor little man , and you wo n't give me a paltry thousand francs . '
46173	46181	46185	46186	Miss Spencer	149	' You have already had your price . '
46199	46205	46120	46121	the lady	847	' I want another thousand . '
46206	46212	46120	46121	the lady	847	' I have n't it . '
46213	46219	46120	46121	the lady	847	' Then we 'll see . '
46268	46276	46277	46277	he	167	' Now for that lantern of yours , '
46322	46327	46329	46330	Prince Aribert	167	' What is it ? '
46414	46420	46422	46422	Racksole	151	' Who can it be ? '
46424	46429	46431	46432	the Prince	2578	' It is Eugen , '
46444	46447	46448	46449	Prince Aribert	167	' EUGEN , '
46666	46669	46671	46672	Prince Aribert	167	' Eugen , '
46698	46707	46689	46689	Aribert	167	' Perhaps he can not see us clearly . '
46708	46717	46719	46719	Racksole	151	' But he must surely recognize your voice , '
46772	46780	46782	46782	Aribert	167	' Thank God he is not dead ! '
46784	46792	46793	46793	Racksole	151	' He may be worse than dead ! '
46796	46805	46793	46793	Racksole	151	' Worse than - What do you mean ? '

47240	47251	47253	47253	Aribert	167	' And Miss Spencer after her , do you think ? '
47255	47276	47319	47320	Silently Racksole	214	' No . She would stay . She would never dare to leave . Let us find the cellar steps . '
47434	47443	47444	47444	she	149	' I heard you , I heard you , '

48088	48101	48102	48102	Racksole	151	' Do n't you think we 'd better search the house first ? '
48105	48132	48102	48102	Racksole	151	' it will be safer to know just how we stand . We ca n't afford any ambushes or things of that kind , you know . '

48527	48563	48524	48524	Eugen	180	' That is my friend Mr Racksole , an Englishman - or rather , I should say , an American - to whom we owe a great deal . Come and have supper , Eugen . '
48564	48569	48571	48571	Eugen	180	' I wo n't , '

48870	48879	48858	48860	the poor fellow	667	' Why did you not say this before ? '

49034	49074	49030	49030	she	155	' you might have told me . I could n't sleep . I inquired from the h"tel - folks if you had retired , and they said no ; so I slipped out . I guessed where you were . '

49196	49221	49193	49193	she	155	' That is all , but it will be enough . Do you know if there is a bed anywhere in this remarkable house ? '

49536	49551	49529	49530	Prince Aribert	167	' Will it not be necessary to make some awkward explanation to the doctor ? '
49552	49557	49558	49558	she	149	' Not at all ! '
49561	49600	49558	49558	she	149	' Why should it be ? In a place like Ostend doctors are far too discreet to ask questions ; they see too much to retain their curiosity . Besides , do you want your nephew to die ? '

53830	53835	53844	53844	himself	167	' My dear Eugen , '
53846	53852	53844	53844	himself	167	' Do n't be absurd . '
53853	53903	53809	53811	the Hereditary Prince	1765	' I say you think I am mad . You think that that attack of brain fever has left its permanent mark on me . Well , perhaps I am mad . Who can tell ? God knows that I have been through enough lately to drive me mad . '
54056	54061	54063	54063	Eugen	180	' By the way , '
54066	54105	54063	54063	Eugen	180	' I must reward these Racksoles , I suppose . I am indeed grateful to them . If I gave the girl a bracelet , and the father a thousand guineas - how would that meet the case ? '
54106	54111	54113	54113	Aribert	167	' My dear Eugen ! '
54116	54154	54113	54113	Aribert	167	' A thousand guineas ! Do you know that Theodore Racksole could buy up all Posen from end to end without making himself a pauper . A thousand guineas ! You might as well offer him sixpence . '
54155	54162	54063	54063	Eugen	180	' Then what must I offer ? '
54163	54184	54113	54113	Aribert	167	' Nothing , except your thanks . Anything else would be an insult . These are no ordinary h"tel people . '
54185	54196	54063	54063	Eugen	180	' Ca n't I give the little girl a bracelet ? '
54210	54213	54214	54214	he	167	' No , '
54217	54227	54229	54230	Prince Eugen	180	' Why did you kiss her - that night ? '
54233	54237	54239	54239	Aribert	167	' Kiss whom ? '
54256	54261	54204	54204	Aribert	167	' The Racksole girl . '
54262	54268	54229	54230	Prince Eugen	180	' When do you mean ? '
54269	54273	54275	54276	Prince Eugen	180	' I mean , '
54278	54338	54275	54276	Prince Eugen	180	' that night in Ostend when I was ill . You thought I was in a delirium . Perhaps I was . But somehow I remember that with extraordinary distinctness . I remember raising my head for a fraction of an instant , and just in that fraction of an instant you kissed her . Oh , Uncle Aribert ! '
54339	54359	54229	54230	Prince Eugen	180	' Listen , Eugen , for God 's sake . I love Nella Racksole . I shall marry her . '
54360	54363	54275	54276	Prince Eugen	180	' You ! '
54375	54378	54379	54379	he	180	' Ah ! '
54382	54411	54379	54379	he	180	' They all talk like that to start with . I have talked like that myself , dear uncle ; it sounds nice , and it means nothing . '
54412	54422	54424	54424	Aribert	185	' In this case it means everything , Eugen , '
54442	54449	54450	54450	he	180	' You ca n't marry her , '
54453	54463	54450	54450	he	180	' The Emperor wo n't permit a morganatic marriage . '
54464	54480	54379	54379	he	180	' The Emperor has nothing to do with the affair . I shall renounce my rights .
54488	54488	54481	54481	I	0	'
54489	54502	54450	54450	he	180	' In which case you will have no fortune to speak of . '
54503	54542	54544	54544	Aribert	185	' But my wife will have a fortune . Knowing the sacrifices which I shall have made in order to marry her , she will not hesitate to place that fortune in my hands for our mutual use , '
54547	54554	54556	54556	Eugen	180	' You will decidedly be rich , '
54569	54577	54578	54578	he	185	' But have you thought of this , '
54593	54623	54582	54582	his	185	' Have you thought that I am unmarried , and might die at any moment , and then the throne will descend to you - to you , Aribert ? '
54624	54635	54637	54637	Aribert	185	' The throne will never descend to me , Eugen , '
54640	54657	54637	54637	Aribert	185	' for you will live . You are thoroughly convalescent . You have nothing to fear . '
54658	54669	54671	54671	Eugen	180	' It is the next seven days that I fear , '
54673	54681	54582	54582	his	185	' The next seven days ! Why ? '
54682	54699	54637	54637	Aribert	185	' I do not know . But I fear them . If I can survive them - '
54700	54707	54708	54708	Hans	223	' Mr Sampson Levi , sire , '
54729	54735	54736	54736	he	180	' I will see him , '
54757	54764	54766	54766	Aribert	185	' I beg one moment first , '
54798	54803	54805	54806	Prince Eugen	180	' What is it ? '
54809	54845	54805	54806	Prince Eugen	180	' Why this sudden seriousness ? Do n't forget that I have an appointment with Mr Sampson Levi , and must not keep him waiting . Someone said that punctuality is the politeness of princes . '
54846	54849	54851	54851	Aribert	185	' Eugen , '
54853	54905	54851	54851	Aribert	185	' I wish you to be as serious as I am . Why can not we have faith in each other ? I want to help you . I have helped you . You are my titular Sovereign ; but on the other hand I have the honour to be your uncle :
54970	54970	54964	54964	you	1782	'
54971	54979	54981	54981	Eugen	180	' What do you mean , Aribert ? '
54995	55003	54981	54981	Eugen	180	' What do you want to say ? '
55004	55028	54964	54964	you	1782	' Well , in the first place , I want to say that you will not succeed with the estimable Mr Sampson Levi . '
55029	55034	55036	55036	Eugen	180	' Shall I not ? '
55039	55051	55036	55036	Eugen	180	' How do you know what my business is with him ? '
55052	55072	54964	54964	you	1782	' Suffice it to say that I know . You will never get that million pounds out of him . '
55083	55092	55080	55080	his	180	' Who has been talking ? What million ? '
55101	55104	55105	55105	he	180	' Ah ! '
55112	55151	55105	55105	he	180	' I see how it is . I have been chattering in my delirium . You must n't take any notice of that , Aribert . When one has a fever one 's ideas become grotesque and fanciful . '
55152	55160	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' You never talked in your delirium , '
55164	55184	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' at least not about yourself . I knew about this projected loan before I saw you in Ostend . '
55185	55190	55192	55192	Eugen	180	' Who told you ? '
55195	55208	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Then you admit that you are trying to raise a loan ? '
55209	55218	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' I admit nothing . Who told you ? '
55219	55275	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Theodore Racksole , the millionaire . These rich men have no secrets from each other . They form a coterie , closer than any coterie of ours . Eugen , and far more powerful . They talk , and in talking they rule the world , these millionaires . They are the real monarchs . '
55276	55280	55282	55282	Eugen	180	' Curse them ! '
55284	55399	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Yes , perhaps so . But let me return to your case . Imagine my shame , my disgust , when I found that Racksole could tell me more about your affairs than I knew myself . Happily , he is a good fellow ; one can trust him ; otherwise I should have been tempted to do something desperate when I discovered that all your private history was in his hands . Eugen , let us come to the point ; why do you want that million ? Is it actually true that you are so deeply in debt ? I have no desire to improve the occasion . I merely ask . '
55400	55410	55412	55413	Prince Eugen	180	' And what if I do owe a million ? '
55418	55453	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Oh , nothing , my dear Eugen , nothing . Only it is rather a large sum to have scattered in ten years , is it not ? How did you manage it ? '
55454	55508	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Do n't ask me , Aribert . I 've been a fool . But I swear to you that the woman whom you call " the lady in the red hat " is the last of my follies . I am about to take a wife , and become a respectable Prince . '
55509	55521	55540	55540	Aribert	185	' Then the engagement with Princess Anna is an accomplished fact ? '
55522	55539	55161	55161	Aribert	185	' Practically so . As soon as I have settled with Levi , all will be smooth .
55572	55572	55569	55570	an angel	1787	'
55573	55587	55540	55540	Aribert	185	' And yet you would deceive her as to your debts , Eugen ? '
55588	55623	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' Not her , but her absurd parents , and perhaps the Emperor . They have heard rumours , and I must set those rumours at rest by presenting to them a clean sheet . '
55624	55637	55639	55640	Prince Aribert	167	' I am glad you have been frank with me , Eugen , '
55642	55659	55639	55640	Prince Aribert	167	' but I will be plain with you . You will never marry the Princess Anna . '
55660	55664	55666	55666	Eugen	180	' And why ? '
55671	55705	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' Because her parents will not permit it . Because you will not be able to present a clean sheet to them . Because this Sampson Levi will never lend you a million . '
55706	55710	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' Explain yourself . '
55711	55737	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' I propose to do so . You were kidnapped - it is a horrid word , but we must use it - in Ostend . '
55738	55741	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' True . '
55742	55748	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' Do you know why ? '
55749	55782	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' I suppose because that vile old red - hatted woman and her accomplices wanted to get some money out of me . Fortunately , thanks to you , they did n't . '
55783	55788	55790	55790	Aribert	167	' Not at all , '
55792	55842	55790	55790	Aribert	167	' They wanted no money from you . They knew well enough that you had no money . They knew you were the naughty schoolboy among European Princes , with no sense of responsibility or of duty towards your kingdom . Shall I tell you why they kidnapped you ? '
55843	55855	55569	55570	an angel	1787	' When you have done abusing me , my dear uncle . '
55856	55929	55790	55790	Aribert	167	' They kidnapped you merely to keep you out of England for a few days , merely to compel you to fail in your appointment with Sampson Levi . And it appears to me that they succeeded . Assuming that you do n't obtain the money from Levi , is there another financier in all Europe from whom you can get it - on such strange security as you have to offer ? '
55930	55936	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Possibly there is not , '
55942	55991	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' But , you see , I shall get it from Sampson Levi . Levi promised it , and I know from other sources that he is a man of his word . He said that the money , subject to certain formalities , would be available till - '
55992	55995	55790	55790	Aribert	167	' Till ? '
55996	56003	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Till the end of June . '
56004	56014	55790	55790	Aribert	167	' And it is now the end of July . '
56015	56071	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Well , what is a month ? He is only too glad to lend the money . He will get excellent interest . How on earth have you got into your sage old head this notion of a plot against me ? The idea is ridiculous . A plot against me ? What for ? '
56072	56080	56082	56082	Aribert	167	' Have you ever thought of Bosnia ? '
56085	56090	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' What of Bosnia ? '
56091	56128	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' I need not tell you that the King of Bosnia is naturally under obligations to Austria , to whom he owes his crown . Austria is anxious for him to make a good influential marriage . '
56129	56135	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Well , let him . '
56136	56151	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' He is going to . He is going to marry the Princess Anna . '
56152	56170	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Not while I live . He made overtures there a year ago , and was rebuffed . '
56171	56259	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Yes ; but he will make overtures again , and this time he will not be rebuffed . Oh , Eugen ! ca n't you see that this plot against you is being engineered by some persons who know all about your affairs , and whose desire is to prevent your marriage with Princess Anna ? Only one man in Europe can have any motive for wishing to prevent your marriage with Princess Anna , and that is the man who means to marry her himself . '
56265	56293	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Then , Aribert , do you mean to convey to me that my detention in Ostend was contrived by the agents of the King of Bosnia ? '
56294	56298	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' I do . '
56299	56325	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' With a view to stopping my negotiations with Sampson Levi , and so putting an end to the possibility of my marriage with Anna ? '
56329	56348	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' You are a good friend to me , Aribert . You mean well . But you are mistaken .
56356	56356	56349	56349	You	167	'
56357	56365	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' Have you forgotten about Reginald Dimmock ? '
56366	56376	56349	56349	You	167	' I remember you said that he had died . '
56377	56403	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' I said nothing of the sort . I said that he had been assassinated . That was part of it , my poor Eugen . '
56404	56407	56409	56409	Eugen	180	' Pooh ! '
56411	56456	56457	56457	Aribert	167	' I do n't believe he was assassinated . And as for Sampson Levi , I will bet you a thousand marks that he and I come to terms this morning , and that the million is in my hands before I leave London . '
56462	56485	55938	55939	Prince Eugen	180	' You seem to be pretty sure of Mr Levi 's character . Have you had much to do with him before ? '
56486	56489	56490	56490	Eugen	180	' Well , '
56495	56521	56490	56490	Eugen	180	' a little . What young man in my position has n't had something to do with Mr Sampson Levi at one time or another ? '
56522	56527	56529	56529	Aribert	167	' I have n't , '
56531	56539	56540	56540	He	167	' You ! You are a fossil . '
56546	56556	56540	56540	He	167	' Hans ! I will receive Mr Sampson Levi . '
56589	56597	56599	56600	Sampson Levi	184	' Good morning , your Royal Highness , '
56607	56616	56599	56600	Sampson Levi	184	' I trust your Royal Highness is well . '
56617	56622	56624	56625	the Prince	2578	' Moderately , thanks , '
56705	56714	56716	56717	Prince Eugen	180	' We will proceed to business at once , '
56719	56729	56716	56717	Prince Eugen	180	' Will you take a seat , Mr Levi ? '
56730	56737	56691	56691	he	184	' I thank your Royal Highness . '
56738	56759	56761	56762	the Prince	2578	' Now as to that loan which we had already practically arranged - a million , I think it was , '
56765	56769	56770	56770	Levi	184	' A million , '
56780	56803	56691	56691	he	184	' Everything is now in order . Here are the papers and I should like to finish the matter up at once . '
56804	56812	56691	56691	he	184	' Exactly , your Highness , but - '
56813	56935	56936	56937	Prince Eugen	180	' But what ? You months ago expressed the warmest satisfaction at the security , though I am quite prepared to admit that the security , is of rather an unusual nature . You also agreed to the rate of interest . It is not everyone , Mr Levi , who can lend out a million at 5 - 1 2 per cent . And in ten years the whole amount will be paid back . I - er - I believe I informed you that the fortune of Princess Anna , who is about to accept my hand , will ultimately amount to something like fifty millions of marks , which is over two million pounds in your English money . '
56961	56974	56976	56978	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' You see , it 's like this , your Royal Highness , '
56986	57063	56981	56981	his	184	' It 's like this . I said I could keep that bit of money available till the end of June , and you were to give me an interview here before that date . Not having heard from your Highness , and not knowing your Highness 's address , though my German agents made every inquiry , I concluded , that you had made other arrangements , money being so cheap this last few months . '
57064	57072	57074	57075	Prince Eugen	180	' I was unfortunately detained at Ostend , '
57086	57124	57074	57075	Prince Eugen	180	' by - by important business . I have made no other arrangements , and I shall have need of the million . If you will be so good as to pay it to my London bankers - '
57125	57127	57173	57173	your	1796	' I 'm
57131	57151	57173	57173	your	1796	' said Mr Sampson Levi , with a tremendous and dazzling air of politeness , which surprised even himself , '
57185	57185	57168	57168	I	0	'
57186	57195	57197	57198	the Prince	2578	' Hang the Chilean Government , Mr Levi , '
57205	57217	57201	57201	he	2578	' I must have that million . It was an arrangement . '
57218	57227	57229	57231	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' It was an arrangement , I admit , '
57233	57241	57229	57231	Mr Sampson Levi	184	' but your Highness broke the arrangement . '
57248	57255	57257	57258	the Prince	2578	' Do you mean to say , '
57263	57278	57257	57258	the Prince	2578	' that you are not in a position to let me have that million ? '
57279	57293	57201	57201	he	2578	' I could let your Highness have a million in a couple of years '
57296	57296	57201	57201	he	2578	'
57305	57309	57310	57310	he	2578	' Mr Levi , '
57313	57363	57310	57310	he	2578	' if you do not place the money in my hands to - morrow you will ruin one of the oldest of reigning families , and , incidentally , you will alter the map of Europe . You are not keeping faith , and I had relied on you . '
57364	57371	57373	57374	little Levi	184	' Pardon me , your Highness , '
57380	57413	57373	57374	little Levi	184	' it is not I who have not kept faith . I beg to repeat that the money is no longer at my disposal , and to bid your Highness good morning . '
57532	57535	57537	57538	Prince Eugen	180	' Aribert , '
57544	57560	57537	57538	Prince Eugen	180	' you were right . It is all over . I have only one refuge - '
57561	57567	57568	57568	Aribert	167	' You do n't mean - '
57573	57579	57580	57580	he	167	' Yes , I do , '
57584	57598	57580	57580	he	167	' I can manage it so that it will look like an accident . '
58786	58792	58784	58784	himself	151	' I must do something . '
58908	58914	58891	58892	the conductor	1872	' There goes a lunatic . '
58935	58944	58946	58947	Theodore Racksole	151	' What are the best you 've got ? '
58949	58956	58958	58959	the man	442	' Five shillings each , sir , '
58962	58969	58971	58972	Theodore Racksole	151	' Give me a penny one , '
59030	59037	59014	59015	a gentleman	2671	' Good evening , Mr Racksole . '
59078	59084	59085	59085	he	151	' Well , Mr Babylon , '
59090	59110	59085	59085	he	151	' of all persons in the wide world you are the man I would most have wished to meet . '
59111	59116	59118	59121	the little Anglicized Swiss	1883	' You flatter me , '
59123	59130	59132	59132	Racksole	151	' No , I do n't , '
59134	59173	59132	59132	Racksole	151	' it is n't my custom , any more than it 's yours . I wanted to have a real good long yarn with you , and lo ! here you are ! Where have you sprung from ? '
59174	59178	59180	59181	Felix Babylon	153	' From Lausanne , '
59183	59221	59223	59223	he	153	' I had finished my duties there , I had nothing else to do , and I felt homesick . I felt the nostalgia of London , and so I came over , just as you see , '
59232	59244	59245	59245	He	153	' One toothbrush , one razor , two slippers , eh ? '
59248	59270	59245	59245	He	153	' I was wondering as I walked along where I should stay - me , Felix Babylon , homeless in London . '
59271	59283	59284	59284	Racksole	151	' I should advise you to stay at the Grand Babylon , '
59288	59302	59245	59245	He	153	' It is a good h"tel , and I know the proprietor personally . '
59303	59311	59313	59313	Babylon	153	' Rather expensive , is it not ? '
59315	59321	59323	59323	Racksole	151	' To you , sir , '
59325	59342	59323	59323	Racksole	151	' the inclusive terms will be exactly half a crown a week . Do you accept ? '
59343	59347	59349	59349	Babylon	153	' I accept , '
59354	59363	59349	59349	Babylon	153	' You are very good , Mr Racksole . '
59387	59391	59393	59394	Felix Babylon	153	' Many customers ? '
59396	59400	59402	59402	Racksole	151	' Very tolerable , '
59419	59442	59402	59402	Racksole	151	' I think I may say in the storekeeper 's phrase , that if there is any business about I am doing it .
59483	59483	59416	59416	he	151	'
59484	59489	59491	59491	Babylon	153	' In that case , '
59494	59502	59491	59491	Babylon	153	' let me offer you another cigar . '
59503	59512	59416	59416	he	151	' But I have not finished this one . '
59513	59580	59491	59491	Babylon	153	' That is just why I wish to offer you another one . A cigar such as yours , my good friend , ought never to be smoked within the precincts of the Grand Babylon , not even by the proprietor of the Grand Babylon , and especially when all the guests are assembled in the portico . The fumes of it would ruin any h"tel . '
59666	59674	59676	59676	Babylon	153	' This chicken is almost perfectly grilled , '
59680	59708	59676	59676	Babylon	153	' It is a credit to the house . But why , my dear Racksole , why in the name of Heaven did you quarrel with Rocco ? '
59709	59715	59650	59650	Racksole	151	' Then you have heard ? '
59716	59791	59676	59676	Babylon	153	' Heard ! My dear friend , it was in every newspaper on the Continent . Some journals prophesied that the Grand Babylon would have to close its doors within half a year now that Rocco had deserted it . But of course I knew better . I knew that you must have a good reason for allowing Rocco to depart , and that you must have made arrangements in advance for a substitute . '
59792	59807	59809	59810	Theodore Racksole	151	' As a matter of fact , I had not made arrangements in advance , '
59816	59845	59809	59810	Theodore Racksole	151	' but happily we have found in our second sous - chef an artist inferior only to Rocco himself . That , however , was mere good fortune . '
59846	59849	59851	59851	Babylon	153	' Surely , '
59853	59869	59851	59851	Babylon	153	' it was indiscreet to trust to mere good fortune in such a serious matter ? '
59870	59894	59809	59810	Theodore Racksole	151	' I did n't trust to mere good fortune . I did n't trust to anything except Rocco , and he deceived me . '
59895	59904	59851	59851	Babylon	153	' But why did you quarrel with him ? '
59905	59926	59809	59810	Theodore Racksole	151	' I did n't quarrel with him . I found him embalming a corpse in the State bedroom one night - '
59927	59931	59932	59932	Babylon	153	' You what ? '
59936	59948	59950	59950	Racksole	151	' I found him embalming a corpse in the State bedroom , '
59972	59976	59978	59978	Babylon	153	' Tell me , '
60065	60072	60074	60074	Racksole	151	' Time for whisky and soda , '
60092	60123	60125	60125	Babylon	153	' You have told me that this Sampson Levi had an audience of Prince Eugen to - day , but you have not told me the result of that audience , '
60127	60176	60087	60087	Babylon	153	' Because I do not yet know it . But I shall doubtless know to - morrow . In the meantime , I feel fairly sure that Levi declined to produce Prince Eugen 's required million . I have reason to believe that the money was lent elsewhere . '
60177	60180	60182	60182	Babylon	153	' H'm ! '
60189	60209	60182	60182	Babylon	153	' I am not at all surprised at that arrangement for spying through the bathroom of the State apartments . '
60210	60217	60087	60087	Babylon	153	' Why are you not surprised ? '
60218	60221	60223	60223	Babylon	153	' Oh ! '
60225	60369	60223	60223	Babylon	153	' it is such an obvious dodge - so easy to carry out . As for me , I took special care never to involve myself in these affairs . I knew they existed ; I somehow felt that they existed . But I also felt that they lay outside my sphere . My business was to provide board and lodging of the most sumptuous kind to those who did n't mind paying for it ; and I did my business . If anything else went on in the h"tel , under the rose , I long determined to ignore it unless it should happen to be brought before my notice ; and it never was brought before my notice . However , I admit that there is a certain pleasurable excitement in this kind of affair and doubtless you have experienced that . '
60370	60374	60376	60376	Racksole	151	' I have , '
60379	60389	60376	60376	Racksole	151	' though I believe you are laughing at me . '
60390	60395	60396	60396	Babylon	153	' By no means , '
60399	60418	60396	60396	Babylon	153	' Now what , if I may ask the question , is going to be your next step ? '
60419	60430	60432	60433	Theodore Racksole	151	' That is just what I desire to know myself , '
60435	60438	60440	60440	Babylon	153	' Well , '
60446	60475	60440	60440	Babylon	153	' let us begin . In the first place , it is possible you may be interested to hear that I happened to see Jules to - day . '
60476	60480	60481	60481	Racksole	151	' You did ! '
60487	60490	60481	60481	Racksole	151	' Where ? '
60491	60649	60440	60440	Babylon	153	' Well , it was early this morning , in Paris , just before I left there . The meeting was quite accidental , and Jules seemed rather surprised at meeting me . He respectfully inquired where I was going , and I said that I was going to Switzerland . At that moment I thought I was going to Switzerland . It had occurred to me that after all I should be happier there , and that I had better turn back and not see London any more . However , I changed my mind once again , and decided to come on to London , and accept the risks of being miserable there without my h"tel . Then I asked Jules whither he was bound , and he told me that he was off to Constantinople , being interested in a new French h"tel there . I wished him good luck , and we parted . '
60650	60655	60657	60657	Racksole	151	' Constantinople , eh ! '
60659	60671	60657	60657	Racksole	151	' A highly suitable place for him , I should say . '
60672	60675	60676	60676	Babylon	153	' But , '
60679	60687	60676	60676	Babylon	153	' I caught sight of him again . '
60688	60691	60657	60657	Racksole	151	' Where ? '
60692	60708	60676	60676	Babylon	153	' At Charing Cross , a few minutes before I had the pleasure of meeting you .
60748	60748	60676	60676	Babylon	153	'
60749	60756	60758	60759	Theodore Racksole	151	' The cheek of the fellow ! '
60761	60771	60758	60759	Theodore Racksole	151	' The gorgeous and colossal cheek of the fellow ! '
60784	60796	60798	60799	Theodore Racksole	151	' DO you know anything of the antecedents of this Jules , '
60806	60810	60812	60812	Babylon	153	' Nothing whatever , '
60814	60953	60812	60812	Babylon	153	' Until you told me , I do n't think I was aware that his true name was Thomas Jackson , though of course I knew that it was not Jules . I certainly was not aware that Miss Spencer was his wife , but I had long suspected that their relations were somewhat more intimate than the nature of their respective duties in the h"tel absolutely demanded . All that I do know of Jules - he will always be called Jules - is that he gradually , by some mysterious personal force , acquired a prominent position in the h"tel . Decidedly he was the cleverest and most intellectual waiter I have ever known , and he was specially skilled in the difficult task of retaining his own dignity while not interfering with that of other people .
60955	60975	60954	60954	I	0	'm afraid this information is a little too vague to be of any practical assistance in the present difficulty . '
60976	60983	60984	60984	Racksole	151	' What is the present difficulty ? '
60992	61011	60984	60984	Racksole	151	' I should imagine that the present difficulty is to account for the man 's presence in London . '
61012	61019	61021	61021	Racksole	151	' That is easily accounted for , '
61023	61051	60954	60954	I	0	' How ? Do you suppose he is anxious to give himself up to justice , or that the chains of habit bind him to the h"tel ? '
61052	61055	61057	61057	Racksole	151	' Neither , '
61059	61072	61057	61057	Racksole	151	' Jules is going to have another try - that 's all . '
61073	61079	60954	60954	I	0	' Another try at what ? '
61080	61196	61057	61057	Racksole	151	' At Prince Eugen . Either at his life or his liberty . Most probably the former this time ; almost certainly the former . He has guessed that we are somewhat handicapped by our anxiety to keep Prince Eugen 's predicament quite quiet , and he is taking advantage , of that fact . As he already is fairly rich , on his own admission , the reward which has been offered to him must be enormous , and he is absolutely determined to get it . He has several times recently proved himself to be a daring fellow ; unless I am mistaken he will shortly prove himself to be still more daring . '
61197	61222	60954	60954	I	0	' But what can he do ? Surely you do n't suggest that he will attempt the life of Prince Eugen in this h"tel ? '
61223	61249	61057	61057	Racksole	151	' Why not ? If Reginald Dimmock fell on mere suspicion that he would turn out unfaithful to the conspiracy , why not Prince Eugen ? '
61250	61267	60954	60954	I	0	' But it would be an unspeakable crime , and do infinite harm to the h"tel ! '
61268	61271	61272	61272	Racksole	151	' True ! '
61292	61300	61301	61301	he	153	' How could it possibly be done ? '
61306	61311	60954	60954	I	0	' Dimmock was poisoned . '
61312	61451	61272	61272	Racksole	151	' Yes , but you had Rocco here then , and Rocco was in the plot . It is conceivable that Rocco could have managed it - barely conceivable . But without Rocco I can not think it possible . I can not even think that Jules would attempt it . You see , in a place like the Grand Babylon , as probably I need n't point out to you , food has to pass through so many hands that to poison one person without killing perhaps fifty would be a most delicate operation . Moreover , Prince Eugen , unless he has changed his habits , is always served by his own attendant , old Hans , and therefore any attempt to tamper with a cooked dish immediately before serving would be hazardous in the extreme . '
61452	61455	61457	61457	Racksole	151	' Granted , '
61459	61471	61457	61457	Racksole	151	' The wine , however , might be more easily got at .
61478	61478	61473	61473	you	151	'
61479	61484	61485	61485	Babylon	153	' I had not , '
61488	61533	61485	61485	Babylon	153	' You are an ingenious theorist , but I happen to know that Prince Eugen always has his wine opened in his own presence . No doubt it would be opened by Hans . Therefore the wine theory is not tenable , my friend . '
61534	61541	61543	61543	Racksole	151	' I do not see why , '
61545	61594	61543	61543	Racksole	151	' I know nothing of wine as an expert , and I very seldom drink it , but it seems to me that a bottle of wine might be tampered with while it was still in the cellar , especially if there was an accomplice in the h"tel . '
61595	61612	61485	61485	Babylon	153	' You think , then , that you are not yet rid of all your conspirators ? '
61613	61627	61543	61543	Racksole	151	' I think that Jules might still have an accomplice within the building . '
61628	61648	61485	61485	Babylon	153	' And that a bottle of wine could be opened and recorked without leaving any trace of the operation ? '
61655	61673	61675	61675	Racksole	151	' I do n't see the necessity of opening the bottle in order to poison the wine , '
61677	61733	61675	61675	Racksole	151	' I have never tried to poison anybody by means of a bottle of wine , and I do n't lay claim to any natural talent as a poisoner , but I think I could devise several ways of managing the trick . Of course , I admit I may be entirely mistaken as to Jules '
61736	61736	61675	61675	Racksole	151	'
61737	61740	61742	61743	Felix Babylon	153	' Ah ! '
61745	61853	61742	61743	Felix Babylon	153	' The wine cellars beneath us are one of the wonders of London . I hope you are aware , Mr Racksole , that when you bought the Grand Babylon you bought what is probably the finest stock of wines in England , if not in Europe . In the valuation I reckoned them at sixty thousand pounds . And I may say that I always took care that the cellars were properly guarded . Even Jules would experience a serious difficulty in breaking into the cellars without the connivance of the wine - clerk , and the wine - clerk is , or was , incorruptible . '
61854	61869	61871	61871	Racksole	151	' I am ashamed to say that I have not yet inspected my wines , '
61873	61907	61871	61871	Racksole	151	' I have never given them a thought . Once or twice I have taken the trouble to make a tour of the h"tel , but I omitted the cellars in my excursions . '
61908	61915	61917	61917	Babylon	162	' Impossible , my dear fellow ! '
61940	61960	61917	61917	Babylon	162	' But really you must see them to - morrow . If I may , I will accompany you . '
61961	61968	61969	61969	Racksole	151	' Why not to - night ? '
61974	61991	61969	61969	Racksole	151	' To - night ! It is very late : Hubbard will have gone to bed . '
61992	62008	61871	61871	Racksole	151	' And may I ask who is Hubbard ? I remember the name but dimly . '
62009	62021	62023	62023	Felix	153	' Hubbard is the wine - clerk of the Grand Babylon , '
62030	62106	62107	62107	Babylon	153	' A sedate man of forty . He has the keys of the cellars . He knows every bottle of every bin , its date , its qualities , its value . And he 's a teetotaler . Hubbard is a curiosity . No wine can leave the cellars without his knowledge , and no person can enter the cellars without his knowledge . At least , that is how it was in my time , '
62110	62116	62118	62118	Racksole	151	' We will wake him , '
62120	62130	62131	62131	Babylon	153	' But it is one o'clock in the morning , '
62134	62165	62166	62166	Babylon	153	' Never mind - that is , if you consent to accompany me . A cellar is the same by night as by day . Therefore , why not now ? '
62171	62176	62177	62177	he	153	' As you wish , '
62185	62201	62203	62203	Racksole	151	' And now to find this Mr Hubbard , with his key of the cupboard , '
62717	62723	62725	62725	He	151	' a sight for sair een '
62885	62888	62912	62912	he	1941	' Spanish reds '
62895	62897	62912	62912	he	1941	' Tent '
62943	62947	62912	62912	he	1941	' Tears of Christ '
63017	63023	63025	63025	Racksole	151	' Anything special in there ? '
63045	63048	63050	63050	Babylon	153	' Ah ! '
63057	63065	63050	63050	Babylon	153	' therein lies the cream of all . '
63066	63074	63076	63076	Racksole	151	' The best champagne , I suppose ? '
63078	63081	63083	63083	Babylon	153	' Yes , '
63085	63158	63083	63083	Babylon	153	' the best champagne is there - a very special Sillery , as exquisite as you will find anywhere . But I see , my friend , that you fall into the common error of putting champagne first among wines . That distinction belongs to Burgundy . You have old Burgundy in that cellar , Mr Racksole , which cost me - how much do you think ? - eighty pounds a bottle .
63166	63173	63083	63083	Babylon	153	' he added with a sigh . '
63184	63184	63083	63083	Babylon	153	'
63185	63191	63193	63193	Racksole	151	' Yes , it will , '
63196	63209	63193	63193	Racksole	151	' You and I will have a bottle up to - morrow . '
63210	63213	63215	63215	Babylon	153	' Then , '
63224	63335	63215	63215	Babylon	153	' there is a sample of the Rhine wine dated 1706 which caused such a sensation at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873 . There is also a singularly glorious Persian wine from Shiraz , the like of which I have never seen elsewhere . Also there is an unrivalled vintage of Romanée - Conti , greatest of all modern Burgundies . If I remember right Prince Eugen invariably has a bottle when he comes to stay here . It is not on the h"tel wine list , of course , and only a few customers know of it . We do not precisely hawk it about the dining - room . '
63336	63339	63341	63341	Racksole	151	' Indeed ! '
63343	63349	63341	63341	Racksole	151	' Let us go inside . '
63393	63398	63400	63401	the millionaire	414	' What is that ? '
63404	63418	63341	63341	Racksole	151	' That is merely a ventilation grating . Good ventilation is absolutely essential . '
63419	63427	63428	63428	Racksole	151	' Looks broken , does n't it ? '
63442	63463	63428	63428	Racksole	151	' there 's someone in the cellar . Ca n't you hear breathing , down there , behind that bin ? '
63520	63527	63528	63528	he	151	' Come out , you villain ! '
63582	63587	63588	63588	Nella	155	' WELL , Father , '
63594	63629	63630	63630	She	155	' You should make sure that you have got hold of the right person before you use all that terrible muscular force of yours . I do believe you have broken my shoulder bone . '
63696	63703	63705	63706	Felix Babylon	153	' Good evening , Miss Racksole , '
63711	63718	63705	63706	Felix Babylon	153	' This is an unexpected pleasure . '
63733	63749	63751	63752	the millionaire	414	' May I inquire what you are doing in my wine cellar , Nella Racksole ? '
63812	63818	63820	63820	Nella	155	' I will tell you , '
63822	64003	63820	63820	Nella	155	' I had been reading rather late in my room - the night was so close . I heard Big Ben strike half - past twelve , and then I put the book down , and went out on to the balcony of my window for a little fresh air before going to bed . I leaned over the balcony very quietly - you will remember that I am on the third floor now - and looked down below into the little sunk yard which separates the wall of the h"tel from Salisbury Lane . I was rather astonished to see a figure creeping across the yard . I knew there was no entrance into the h"tel from that yard , and besides , it is fifteen or twenty feet below the level of the street . So I watched . The figure went close up against the wall , and disappeared from my view . I leaned over the balcony as far as I dared , but I could n't see him . I could hear him , however . '
64004	64010	64012	64012	Racksole	155	' What could you hear ? '
64015	64023	64025	64025	Nella	155	' It sounded like a sawing noise , '
64027	64055	64025	64025	Nella	155	' and it went on for quite a long time - nearly a quarter of an hour , I should think - a rasping sort of noise . '
64056	64074	64076	64076	Racksole	155	' Why on earth did n't you come and warn me or someone else in the h"tel ? '
64078	64088	64089	64089	she	155	' Oh , I do n't know , Dad , '
64093	64121	64122	64122	she	155	' I had got interested in it , and I thought I would see it out myself . Well , as I was saying , Mr. Babylon , '
64136	64608	64122	64122	she	155	' that noise went on for quite a long time . At last it stopped , and the figure reappeared from under the wall , crossed the yard , climbed up the opposite wall by some means or other , and so over the railings into Salisbury Lane . I felt rather relieved then , because I knew he had n't actually broken into the h"tel . He walked down Salisbury Lane very slowly . A policeman was just coming up . " Goodnight , officer , " I heard him say to the policeman , and he asked him for a match . The policeman supplied the match , and the other man lighted a cigarette , and proceeded further down the lane . By cricking your neck from my window , Mr Babylon , you can get a glimpse of the Embankment and the river . I saw the man cross the Embankment , and lean over the river wall , where he seemed to be talking to some one . He then walked along the Embankment to Westminster and that was the last I saw of him . I waited a minute or two for him to come back , but he did n't come back , and so I thought it was about time I began to make inquiries into the affair . I went downstairs instantly , and out of the h"tel , through the quadrangle , into Salisbury Lane , and I looked over those railings . There was a ladder on the other side , by which it was perfectly easy - once you had got over the railings - to climb down into the yard . I was horribly afraid lest someone might walk up Salisbury Lane and catch me in the act of negotiating those railings , but no one did , and I surmounted them , with no worse damage than a torn skirt . I crossed the yard on tiptoe , and I found that in the wall , close to the ground and almost exactly under my window , there was an iron grating , about one foot by fourteen inches . I suspected , as there was no other ironwork near , that the mysterious visitor must have been sawing at this grating for private purposes of his own . I gave it a good shake , and I was not at all surprised that a good part of it came off in my hand , leaving just enough room for a person to creep through . I decided that I would creep through , and now wish I had n't . I do n't know , Mr Babylon , whether you have ever tried to creep through a small hole with a skirt on . Have you ? '
64609	64617	64619	64620	little Felix	153	' I have not had that pleasure , '
64637	64644	64647	64647	Nella	155	' Well , you are fortunate , '
64650	64852	64647	64647	Nella	155	' For quite three minutes I thought I should perish in that grating , Dad , with my shoulder inside and the rest of me outside . However , at last , by the most amazing and agonizing efforts , I pulled myself through and fell into this extraordinary cellar more dead than alive . Then I wondered what I should do next . Should I wait for the mysterious visitor to return , and stab him with my pocket scissors if he tried to enter , or should I raise an alarm ? First of all I replaced the broken grating , then I struck a match , and I saw that I had got landed in a wilderness of bottles . The match went out , and I had n't another one . So I sat down in the corner to think . I had just decided to wait and see if the visitor returned , when I heard footsteps , and then voices ; and then you came in . I must say I was rather taken aback , especially as I recognized the voice of Mr Babylon . You see , I did n't want to frighten you .

65357	65387	65354	65354	he	1977	' tactics might be . He proposed that if the man returned he should not be interfered with , but merely watched from the other side of the glass door .
65388	65402	65404	65404	Babylon	153	' You want , as it were , to catch Mr Jules alive ? '
65420	65423	65424	65424	he	153	' Surely , '
65427	65449	65424	65424	he	153	' it would be simpler and easier to inform the police of your suspicion , and to leave everything to them . '
65450	65455	65457	65457	Racksole	155	' My dear fellow , '
65459	65627	65457	65457	Racksole	155	' we have already gone much too far without the police to make it advisable for us to call them in at this somewhat advanced stage of the proceedings . Besides , if you must know it , I have a particular desire to capture the scoundrel myself . I will leave you and Nella here , since Nella insists on seeing everything , and I will arrange things so that once he has entered the cellar Jules will not get out of it again - at any rate through the grating . You had better place yourselves on the other side of the glass door , in the big cellar ; you will be in a position to observe from there , I will skip off at once . All you have to do is to take note of what the fellow does . If he has any accomplices within the h"tel we shall probably be able by that means to discover who the accomplice is . '
65648	65717	65638	65638	Racksole	155	' Now if you lock this glass door on the outside he ca n't escape this way : the panes of glass are too small , and the woodwork too stout . So , if he comes into the trap , you two will have the pleasure of actually seeing him frantically writhe therein , without any personal danger ; but perhaps you 'd better not show yourselves . '

67167	67194	67413	67413	Racksole	151	' I did . And curiously enough we had a bottle of Romanée - Conti , an admirable wine , of which Eugen is passionately fond . '
67195	67206	67413	67413	Racksole	151	' And you will dine with him to - night ? '
67207	67236	67413	67413	Racksole	151	' Most probably . To - day will , I fear , be our last day here . Eugen wishes to return to Posen early to - morrow . '
67237	67245	67247	67247	Racksole	151	' Has it struck you , Prince , '
67249	67270	67247	67247	Racksole	151	' that if Jules had succeeded in poisoning your nephew , he would probably have succeeded also in poisoning you ? '
67271	67279	67281	67281	Aribert	167	' I had not thought of it , '
67283	67343	67281	67281	Aribert	167	' but it would seem so . It appears that so long as he brings down his particular quarry , Jules is careless of anything else that may be accidentally involved in the destruction . However , we need have no fear on that score now . You know the bottle , and you can destroy it at once . '
67344	67354	67356	67356	Racksole	151	' But I do not propose to destroy it , '
67359	67396	67356	67356	Racksole	151	' If Prince Eugen asks for Romanée - Conti to be served to - night , as he probably will , I propose that that precise bottle shall be served to him - and to you . '
67397	67408	67281	67281	Aribert	167	' Then you would poison us in spite of ourselves ? '
67409	67412	67413	67413	Racksole	151	' Scarcely , '
67416	67541	67413	67413	Racksole	151	' My notion is to discover the accomplices within the h"tel . I have already inquired as to the wine - clerk , Hubbard . Now does it not occur to you as extraordinary that on this particular day Mr Hubbard should be ill in bed ? Hubbard , I am informed , is suffering from an attack of stomach poisoning , which has supervened during the night . He says that he does not know what can have caused it . His place in the wine cellars will be taken to - day by his assistant , a mere youth , but to all appearances a fairly smart youth . I need not say that we shall keep an eye on that youth . '
67542	67546	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' One moment , '
67551	67568	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' I do not quite understand how you think the poisoning was to have been effected . '
67569	67654	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' The bottle is now under examination by an expert , who has instructions to remove as little as possible of the stuff which Jules put on the rim of the mouth of it . It will be secretly replaced in its bin during the day . My idea is that by the mere action of pouring out the wine takes up some of the poison , which I deem to be very strong , and thus becomes fatal as it enters the glass . '
67655	67670	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' But surely the servant in attendance would wipe the mouth of the bottle ? '
67671	67717	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' Very carelessly , perhaps . And moreover he would be extremely unlikely to wipe off all the stuff ; some of it has been ingeniously placed just on the inside edge of the rim . Besides , suppose he forgot to wipe the bottle ? '
67718	67742	67547	67548	Prince Aribert	167	' Prince Eugen is always served at dinner by Hans . It is an honour which the faithful old fellow reserves for himself . '
67743	67748	67749	67749	Racksole	151	' But suppose Hans - '
67752	67767	67749	67749	Racksole	151	' Hans an accomplice ! My dear Racksole , the suggestion is wildly impossible . '

67899	67906	67908	67908	Hans	223	' And Romanée - Conti afterwards ? '
67915	67931	67933	67934	Prince Eugen	180	' No , not to - night . I 'll try Sillery to - night , '
67936	67951	67952	67952	he	180	' I think I 'll have Romanée - Conti , Hans , after all , '
67955	67963	67952	67952	he	180	' It suits me better than champagne . '
68066	68081	68059	68060	Prince Eugen	180	' Aribert , I withdraw my promise . Observe that , I withdraw it . '
68140	68146	68148	68148	Aribert	167	' Do n't drink it , '
68152	68157	68148	68148	Aribert	167	' It is poisoned . '
68158	68161	68163	68164	Prince Eugen	180	' Poisoned ! '
68166	68171	68173	68174	old Hans	223	' Poisoned , sire ! '
68191	68215	68186	68186	he	223	' Impossible , sire . I myself opened the bottle . No one else has touched it , and the cork was perfect . '
68216	68224	68225	68225	Aribert	167	' I tell you it is poisoned , '
68228	68237	68239	68239	Hans	223	' Your Highness will pardon an old man , '
68241	68275	68277	68277	he	223	' but to say that this wine is poison is to say that I am a murderer . I will prove to you that it is not poisoned . I will drink it . '
68407	68410	68412	68412	Aribert	167	' Hans ! '
68414	68421	68412	68412	Aribert	167	' Hans ! What is this ? '
68554	68890	68539	68539	he	151	' steam launch . To those who are not thoroughly familiar with it the River Thames and its docks , from London Bridge to Gravesend , seems a vast and uncharted wilderness of craft - a wilderness in which it would be perfectly easy to hide even a three - master successfully . To such people the idea of looking for a steam launch on the river would be about equivalent to the idea of looking for a needle in a bundle of hay . But the fact is , there are hundreds of men between St Katherine 's Wharf and Blackwall who literally know the Thames as the suburban householder knows his back - garden - who can recognize thousands of ships and put a name to them at a distance of half a mile , who are informed as to every movement of vessels on the great stream , who know all the captains , all the engineers , all the lightermen , all the pilots , all the licensed watermen , and all the unlicensed scoundrels from the Tower to Gravesend , and a lot further . By these experts of the Thames the slightest unusual event on the water is noticed and discussed - a wherry can not change hands but they will guess shrewdly upon the price paid and the intentions of the new owner with regard to it . They have a habit of watching the river for the mere interest of the sight , and they talk about everything like housewives gathered of an evening round the cottage door . If the first mate of a Castle Liner gets the sack they will be able to tell you what he said to the captain , what the old man said to him , and what both said to the Board , and having finished off that affair they will cheerfully turn to discussing whether Bill Stevens sank his barge outside the West Indian No.2 by accident or on purpose .

71396	71436	71392	71392	Hazell	236	' committed an error of discretion when he hired the " Squirm " . A scoundrel of his experience and calibre ought certainly to have known better than that . You can not fail to get a clue now . '

I asked where the engineer was , and she inquired what business that was of mine , and requested me to get through with my own business and clear off . Seems rather a smart sort . I poked my nose into everything , but I saw no sign of any one else . Perhaps we 'd better pull away and lie near for a bit , just to see if anything queer occurs . '

It was about fourteen by twelve . It was furnished with a bedstead , a small wardrobe , a - mall washstand and dressing - table , and two chairs . There were two hooks behind the door , a strip of carpet by the bed , and some cheap ornaments on the iron mantelpiece . There was also one electric light . The window was a little square one , high up from the floor , and it looked on the inner quadrangle .

With a man of Theodore Racksole 's temperament there is no time like the present , and at six o'clock , as the bright morning sun brought gaiety into the window , he dressed and went upstairs again to the eighth storey . The commissionaire sat stolid , but alert on his chair , and , at the sight of his master , rose and saluted .

76188	76205	76186	76186	Racksole	151	' who or what is the origin of your vendetta against the life of Prince Eugen ? '
76206	76218	76220	76220	Jules	147	' I had no vendetta against the life of Prince Eugen , '
76222	76303	76220	76220	Jules	147	' at least , not to begin with . I merely undertook , for a consideration , to see that Prince Eugen did not have an interview with a certain Mr Sampson Levi in London before a certain date , that was all . It seemed simple enough . I had been engaged in far more complicated transactions before . I was convinced that I could manage it , with the help of Rocco and Em - and Miss Spencer . '
76304	76311	76186	76186	Racksole	151	' Is that woman your wife ? '
76312	76319	76320	76320	he	147	' She would like to be , '
76323	76710	76320	76320	he	147	' Please do n't interrupt . I had completed my arrangements , when you so inconsiderately bought the h"tel . I do n't mind admitting now that from the very moment when you came across me that night in the corridor I was secretly afraid of you , though I scarcely admitted the fact even to myself then . I thought it safer to shift the scene of our operations to Ostend . I had meant to deal with Prince Eugen in this h"tel , but I decided , then , to intercept him on the Continent , and I despatched Miss Spencer with some instructions . Troubles never come singly , and it happened that just then that fool Dimmock , who had been in the swim with us , chose to prove refractory . The slightest hitch would have upset everything , and I was obliged to - to clear him off the scene . He wanted to back out - he had a bad attack of conscience , and violent measures were essential . I regret his untimely decease , but he brought it on himself . Well , everything was going serenely when you and your brilliant daughter , apparently determined to meddle , turned up again among us at Ostend . Only twenty - four hours , however , had to elapse before the date which had been mentioned to me by my employers . I kept poor little Eugen for the allotted time , and then you managed to get hold of him . I do not deny that you scored there , though , according to my original instructions , you scored too late . The time had passed , and so , so far as I knew , it did n't matter a pin whether Prince Eugen saw Mr Sampson Levi or not . But my employers were still uneasy . They were uneasy even after little Eugen had lain ill in Ostend for several weeks . It appears that they feared that even at that date an interview between Prince Eugen and Mr Sampson Levi might work harm to them . So they applied to me again . This time they wanted Prince Eugen to be - em - finished off entirely . They offered high terms . '
76711	76715	76186	76186	Racksole	151	' What terms ? '
76716	76797	76320	76320	he	147	' I had received fifty thousand pounds for the first job , of which Rocco had half . Rocco was also to be made a member of a certain famous European order , if things went right . That was what he coveted far more than the money - the vain fellow ! For the second job I was offered a hundred thousand . A tolerably large sum . I regret that I have not been able to earn it . '
76798	76806	76808	76808	Racksole	151	' Do you mean to tell me , '

76929	77145	76927	76927	Jules	147	' I know vaguely . I know that he came via Vienna from - em - Bosnia . My impression was that the affair had some bearing , direct or indirect , on the projected marriage of the King of Bosnia . He is a young monarch , scarcely out of political leading - strings , as it were , and doubtless his Ministers thought that they had better arrange his marriage for him . They tried last year , and failed because the Princess whom they had in mind had cast her sparkling eyes on another Prince . That Prince happened to be Prince Eugen of Posen . The Ministers of the King of Bosnia knew exactly the circumstances of Prince Eugen . They knew that he could not marry without liquidating his debts , and they knew that he could only liquidate his debts through this Jew , Sampson Levi . Unfortunately for me , they ultimately wanted to make too sure of Prince Eugen . They were afraid he might after all arrange his marriage without the aid of Mr Sampson Levi , and so - well , you know the rest .... It is a pity that the poor little innocent King of Bosnia ca n't have the Princess of his Ministers '

Swear Hans to secrecy ; swear the doctors to secrecy ; and breathe no word yourself . I have been a fool , but I do not wish it to be known that I was also a coward . Perhaps it is not cowardice ; perhaps it is courage , after all - courage to cut the knot . I could not have survived the disgrace of any revelations , Aribert , and revelations would have been sure to come . I have made a fool of myself , but I am ready to pay for it . We of Posen - we always pay - everything except our debts . Ah ! those debts ! Had it not been for those I could have faced her who was to have been my wife , to have shared my throne .

82247	82266	82069	82069	I	0	' But we can not accept this - this enormous , this incredible favour . It is impossible . '
82267	82270	82271	82271	she	155	' Aribert , '
82275	82312	82271	82271	she	155	' remember you are not in Posen holding a Court reception . You are in England and you are talking to an American girl who has always been in the habit of having her own way . '
82358	82361	82362	82362	he	167	' Eugen , '
82365	82413	82362	82362	he	167	' listen carefully to me . I have news . With the assistance of friends I have arranged to borrow that million for you . It is quite settled , and you may rely on it . But you must get better . Do you hear me ? '
82421	82429	82430	82430	he	167	' Tell me I am not delirious , '
82433	82440	82441	82441	Aribert	167	' Of course you are n't , '
82444	82459	82441	82441	Aribert	167	' But you must n't sit up . You must take care of yourself . '
82460	82467	82468	82468	Eugen	180	' Who will lend the money ? '
82477	82493	82468	82468	Eugen	180	' Never mind . You shall hear later . Devote yourself now to getting better . '
82618	82624	82625	82625	he	167	' These Anglo - Saxons , '
82630	82635	82625	82625	he	167	' what a race ! '
82713	82716	82717	82717	he	167	' Nella , '
82735	82757	82717	82717	he	167	' what am I to say to you ? How can I thank you ? How can I thank your father ? '
82758	82767	82768	82768	she	2431	' You had better not thank my father , '
82771	82803	82768	82768	she	2431	' Dad will affect to regard the thing as a purely business transaction , as , of course , it is . As for me , you can - you can - '
82804	82807	82717	82717	he	167	' Well ? '
82808	82812	82813	82813	she	2431	' Kiss me , '
82816	82832	82813	82813	she	2431	' There ! Are you sure you 've formally proposed to me , mon prince ? '
82833	82838	82839	82839	he	2432	' Ah ! Nell ! '
82849	82859	82839	82839	he	2432	' Be mine ! That is all I want ! '
82860	82865	82866	82866	she	2431	' You 'll find , '
82869	82879	82866	82866	she	2431	' that you 'll want Dad 's consent too ! '
82880	82896	82839	82839	he	2432	' Will he make difficulties ? He could not , Nell - not with you ! '
82897	82902	82903	82903	she	2431	' Better ask him , '
82916	82922	82923	82923	he	2432	' Going on all right ? '
82931	82934	82923	82923	he	2432	' Excellently , '
82945	82948	82950	82950	Racksole	155	' Ah ! '
82952	82976	82950	82950	Racksole	155	' Then , if that 's so , and you can spare a minute , I 've something to show you , Prince . '
82980	82991	82992	82992	Racksole	155	' I'VE a great deal to tell you , Prince , '
83005	83039	82992	82992	Racksole	155	' and also , as I said , something to show you . Will you come to my room ? We will talk there first . The whole h"tel is humming with excitement . '
83040	83044	83046	83046	Aribert	167	' With pleasure , '
83048	83057	83058	83058	Racksole	155	' Glad his Highness Prince Eugen is recovering , '
83067	83074	83075	83075	Aribert	167	' Ah ! As to that - '
83078	83093	83094	83094	Racksole	155	' If you do n't mind , we 'll discuss that later , Prince , '
83107	83118	83119	83119	Racksole	155	' I want to tell you all about last night , '
83122	83137	83119	83119	Racksole	155	' about my capture of Jules , and my examination of him this morning . '
83156	83160	83161	83161	he	167	' You see , '
83164	83204	83161	83161	he	167	' that our suspicions as to Bosnia were tolerably correct . But as regards Bosnia , the more I think about it , the surer I feel that nothing can be done to bring their criminal politicians to justice . '
83205	83218	83272	83272	Jules	147	' And as to Jules , what do you propose to do ? '
83219	83224	83226	83226	Racksole	155	' Come this way , '
83285	83305	83307	83307	Racksole	155	' I have sent for the police - not a street constable , but an official from Scotland Yard , '
83309	83315	83316	83316	Aribert	167	' How did this happen ? '
83323	83338	83316	83316	Aribert	167	' I understood you to say that he was safely immured in the bedroom . '
83339	83344	83345	83345	Racksole	155	' So he was , '
83348	83390	83345	83345	Racksole	155	' I went up there this afternoon , chiefly to take him some food . The commissionaire was on guard at the door . He had heard no noise , nothing unusual . Yet when I entered the room Jules was gone .
83650	83650	83656	83656	he	2443	'
83937	84152	83912	83912	Racksole	151	' dead body . And Racksole was by no means inclined to tell them everything . Beyond question he had transgressed the laws of England , and possibly also the laws of Belgium ; and the moral excellence of his motives in doing so was , of course , in the eyes of legal justice , no excuse for such conduct . The inquest upon Jules aroused some bother ; and about ninety - and - nine separate and distinct rumours . In the end , however , a compromise was arrived at . Racksole 's first aim was to pacify the inspector whose clue , which by the way was a false one , he had so curtly declined to follow up . That done , the rest needed only tact and patience . He proved to the satisfaction of the authorities that he had acted in a perfectly honest spirit , though with a high hand , and that substantial justice had been done . Also , he subtly indicated that , if it came to the point , he should defy them to do their worst . Lastly , he was able , through the medium of the United States Ambassador , to bring certain soothing influences to bear upon the situation .
84247	84257	84259	84259	Racksole	151	' You wish to talk to me , Prince , '
84274	84281	84283	84283	Aribert	167	' I wish to tell you , '
84285	84325	84283	84283	Aribert	167	' that it is my intention to renounce all my rights and titles as a Royal Prince of Posen , and to be known in future as Count Hartz - a rank to which I am entitled through my mother .
84404	84404	84401	84401	your	151	'
84405	84412	84414	84414	Racksole	151	' You honour us , Prince , '
84420	84439	84414	84414	Racksole	151	' and in more ways than one , May I ask your reason for renouncing your princely titles ? '
84440	84465	84401	84401	your	151	' Simply because the idea of a morganatic marriage would be as repugnant to me as it would be to yourself and to Nella . '
84466	84471	84472	84473	The Prince	2578	' That is good . '
84476	84544	84472	84473	The Prince	2578	' I suppose it has occurred to you that ten thousand pounds per annum , for a man in your position , is a somewhat small income . Nella is frightfully extravagant . I have known her to spend sixty thousand dollars in a single year , and have nothing to show for it at the end . Why ! she would ruin you in twelve months . '
84545	84552	84553	84553	Aribert	167	' Nella must reform her ways , '
84556	84565	84566	84566	Racksole	155	' If she is content to do so , '
84570	84578	84566	84566	Racksole	155	' well and good ! I consent . '
84579	84591	84593	84593	Aribert	167	' In her name and my own , I thank you , '
84596	84599	84600	84601	the millionaire	414	' And , '
84604	84675	84600	84601	the millionaire	414	' so that she may not have to reform too fiercely , I shall settle on her absolutely , with reversion to your children , if you have any , a lump sum of fifty million dollars , that is to say , ten million pounds , in sound , selected railway stock . I reckon that is about half my fortune . Nella and I have always shared equally . '
84729	84735	84736	84736	he	153	' I suppose , Racksole , '
84740	84751	84736	84736	he	153	' you are n't getting tired of the Grand Babylon ? '
84752	84758	84694	84694	Nella	155	' Why do you ask ? '
84759	84798	84736	84736	he	153	' Because I am getting tired of doing without it . A thousand times since I sold it to you I have wished I could undo the bargain . I ca n't bear idleness . Will you sell ? '
84799	84803	84805	84805	Racksole	155	' I might , '
84807	84815	84805	84805	Racksole	155	' I might be induced to sell . '
84816	84825	84827	84827	Felix	153	' What will you take , my friend ? '
84828	84833	84736	84736	he	153	' What I gave , '
84839	84842	84843	84843	Felix	153	' Eh ! '
84846	84889	84843	84843	Felix	153	' I sell you my h"tel with Jules , with Rocco , with Miss Spencer . You go and lose all those three inestimable servants , and then offer me the h"tel without them at the same price ! It is monstrous . '
84900	84903	84904	84904	he	153	' Nevertheless , '
84907	84921	84904	84904	he	153	' we will not quarrel about the price . I accept your terms . '
