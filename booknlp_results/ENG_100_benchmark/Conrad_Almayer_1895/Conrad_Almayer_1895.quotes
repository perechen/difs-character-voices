There was that young fellow from the bank who used to ride to the Vinck bungalow early and late . That old woman thought it was for that Emma of hers . When she found out what he wanted exactly , there was a row , I can tell you . She would not have Nina - not an hour longer - in the house . Fact is , I heard of this affair and took the girl to my wife . My wife is a pretty good woman - as women go - and upon my word we would have kept the girl for you , only she would not stay . Now , then ! Do n't flare up , Kaspar . Sit still . What can you do ? It is better so . Let her stay with you . She was never happy over there . Those two Vinck girls are no better than dressed - up monkeys . They slighted her . You ca n't make her white . It 's no use you swearing at me . You ca n't . She is a good girl for all that , but she would not tell my wife anything . If you want to know , ask her yourself ; but if I was you I would leave her alone .

I was a trader once , not now , whatever you may have heard about me in Macassar . And if you want anything , you will not find it here ; I have nothing to give , and want nothing myself . You should go to the Rajah here ; you can see in the daytime his houses across the river , there , where those fires are burning on the shore . He will help you and trade with you .

19196	19261	19194	19194	Almayer	72	" What 's that to you , to her , to anybody ? The man wants to collect trepang and birds ' nests on the islands . He told me so , that Rajah of yours . He will come to - morrow . I want you both to keep away from the house , and let me attend to my business in peace . "

20157	20198	20150	20150	Dain	74	" It is good to let the man come here . Lakamba thinks he knows much . Perhaps the Sultan thinks I want to run away . Better let the one- eyed crocodile sun himself in your campong , Tuan . "
22594	22667	22588	22588	She	72	" And this , and this , and yet this ! Soon he will give more - as much more as I ask . He is a great Rajah - a Son of Heaven ! And she will be a Ranee - he gave all this for her ! Who ever gave anything for me ? I am a slave ! Am I ? I am the mother of a great Ranee ! "

26580	26603	26578	26578	Babalatchi	103	" what is the joy of a poor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of a great - "
26951	26955	26958	26958	Babalatchi	103	" And here , "
26960	26995	26958	26958	Babalatchi	103	" Lakamba my master was getting thin in his anxiety for the trader he had taken under his protection ; and so was Abdulla , for what would wicked men not say if perchance - "
26996	27002	27004	27004	Lakamba	85	" Be silent , fool ! "
27075	27081	27082	27082	he	85	" Speak ! O Dain ! "
27087	27147	27082	27082	he	85	" We have heard many rumours . Many nights in succession has my friend Reshid come here with bad tidings . News travels fast along the coast . But they may be untrue ; there are more lies in men 's mouths in these days than when I was young , but I am not easier to deceive now . "
27148	27155	27157	27157	Dain	74	" All my words are true , "
27161	27189	27190	27190	he	85	" If you want to know what befell my brig , then learn that it is in the hands of the Dutch . Believe me , Rajah , "
27198	27219	27190	27190	he	85	" the Orang Blanda have good friends in Sambir , or else how did they know I was coming thence ? "
27271	27282	27285	27285	Dain	74	" Yes , you faithful friend of the white Rajah , "
27300	27409	27291	27291	Babalatchi	103	" I have escaped , and I am here to gladden your heart . When I saw the Dutch ship I ran the brig inside the reefs and put her ashore . They did not dare to follow with the ship , so they sent the boats . We took to ours and tried to get away , but the ship dropped fireballs at us , and killed many of my men . But I am left , O Babalatchi ! The Dutch are coming here . They are seeking for me . They are coming to ask their faithful friend Lakamba and his slave Babalatchi . Rejoice ! "
27532	27576	27528	27528	he	74	" Are you dumb , O ruler of Sambir , or is the son of a great Rajah unworthy of your notice ? I am come here to seek refuge and to warn you , and want to know what you intend doing . "
27577	27589	27591	27591	Lakamba	85	" You came here because of the white man 's daughter , "
27595	27651	27591	27591	Lakamba	85	" Your refuge was with your father , the Rajah of Bali , the Son of Heaven , the ' Anak Agong ' himself . What am I to protect great princes ? Only yesterday I planted rice in a burnt clearing ; to - day you say I hold your life in my hand . "
27658	27666	27667	27667	he	103	" No man can escape his fate , "
27671	27694	27695	27695	he	103	" When love enters a man 's heart he is like a child - without any understanding . Be merciful , Lakamba , "
27780	27860	27752	27752	he	74	" You came here first as a trader with sweet words and great promises , asking me to look the other way while you worked your will on the white man there . And I did . What do you want now ? When I was young I fought . Now I am old , and want peace . It is easier for me to have you killed than to fight the Dutch . It is better for me . "
27889	27896	27880	27880	Lakamba	85	" Much easier . Much better . "
29278	29286	29287	29287	he	126	" Yes , I am going there , "
29290	29296	29298	29298	Babalatchi	103	" Before the day comes ? "
29300	29307	29309	29309	Dain	126	" I am going there now , "
29313	29338	29309	29309	Dain	126	" The Orang Blanda will not be here before to - morrow night , perhaps , and I must tell Almayer of our arrangements . "
29339	29349	29351	29351	Babalatchi	103	" No , Tuan . No ; say nothing , "
29353	29366	29351	29351	Babalatchi	103	" I will go over myself at sunrise and let him know . "
29367	29372	29374	29374	Dain	126	" I will see , "
29499	29504	29487	29487	Dain	126	" Ada ! Tuan ! "
29513	29520	29522	29522	Babalatchi	103	" This is a great flood ! "
29528	29547	29522	29522	Babalatchi	103	" The river is very angry . Look ! Look at the drifting logs ! Can you go ? "
30036	30044	30046	30046	Babalatchi	103	" There is a very great flood , "
30050	30053	30055	30055	Lakamba	85	" Yes , "
30057	30062	30055	30055	Lakamba	85	" Did Dain go ? "
30063	30084	30099	30099	Lakamba	85	" He went , Tuan . He ran down to the river like a man possessed of the Sheitan himself . "
30091	30097	30099	30099	Lakamba	85	" He may get drowned , "
30109	30116	30118	30118	Babalatchi	103	" The floating logs are many , "
30120	30128	30129	30129	he	103	" but he is a good swimmer , "
30133	30139	30141	30141	Lakamba	85	" He ought to live , "
30143	30151	30152	30152	Babalatchi	103	" he knows where the treasure is . "
30273	30276	30277	30277	he	85	" Babalatchi , "
30287	30295	30277	30277	he	85	" Ada Tuan ! I am listening . "
30296	30326	30277	30277	he	85	" If the Orang Blanda come here , Babalatchi , and take Almayer to Batavia to punish him for smuggling gunpowder , what will he do , you think ? "
30327	30335	30277	30277	he	85	" I do not know , Tuan . "
30336	30342	30344	30344	Lakamba	85	" You are a fool , "
30348	30367	30344	30344	Lakamba	85	" He will tell them where the treasure is , so as to find mercy . He will . "
30399	30404	30406	30406	Lakamba	85	" Almayer must die , "
30410	30429	30406	30406	Lakamba	85	" to make our secret safe . He must die quietly , Babalatchi . You must do it . "
30440	30445	30446	30446	he	1119	" To - morrow ? "
30449	30462	30464	30464	Lakamba	85	" Yes ; before the Dutch come . He drinks much coffee , "
30499	30502	30503	30503	he	85	" Babalatchi , "
30510	30527	30503	30503	he	85	" fetch the box of music the white captain gave me . I can not sleep . "
30585	30592	30593	30593	he	85	" Turn , Babalatchi , turn , "
31138	31150	31151	31151	he	1489	" The fellow had plenty of time to cross the river , "
31154	31207	31151	31151	he	1489	" and there was so much to be done to - day . The settling of details for the early start on the morrow ; the launching of the boats ; the thousand and one finishing touches . For the expedition must start complete , nothing should be forgotten , nothing should - "
31261	31266	31267	31267	he	1489	" What has happened ? "
31287	31294	31267	31267	he	1489	" Is everybody asleep or dead ? "
31671	31677	31679	31679	Mahmat	132	" Ah ya ! There ! "
31681	31690	31691	31691	He	132	" There 's a man amongst the logs . "
31714	31735	31707	31707	his	132	" There 's a body of a man in the river ! Come and see ! A dead - stranger ! "
32083	32088	32078	32078	Netherlands	133	" Sultan of Sambir . "
32199	32206	32207	32207	he	1085	" Oh , Babalatchi ! oh ! "
32211	32222	32207	32207	he	1085	" what is the matter there ? can you see ? "
32783	32863	32779	32779	Mahmat	132	" That is the way , Tuan . His sarong was caught in the broken branch , and he hung with his head under water . When I saw what it was I did not want it here . I wanted it to get clear and drift away . Why should we bury a stranger in the midst of our houses for his ghost to frighten our women and children ? Have we not enough ghosts about this place ? "
32878	32890	32892	32892	he	132	" But the Tuan Babalatchi ordered me to drag the body ashore "
32908	32953	32892	32892	he	132	" and I dragged him by the feet ; in through the mud I have dragged him , although my heart longed to see him float down the river to strand perchance on Bulangi 's clearing - may his father 's grave be defiled ! "
32996	33004	33006	33006	Mahmat	132	" Allah ! What ails the woman ! "
33010	33129	33131	33131	Mahmat	132	" Here , I have touched this carcass which came from nobody knows where , and have most likely defiled myself before eating rice . By orders of Tuan Babalatchi I did this thing to please the white man . Are you pleased , O Tuan Almayer ? And what will be my recompense ? Tuan Babalatchi said a recompense there will be , and from you . Now consider . I have been defiled , and if not defiled I may be under the spell . Look at his anklets ! Who ever heard of a corpse appearing during the night amongst the logs with gold anklets on its legs ? There is witchcraft there . However , "
33138	33166	33131	33131	Mahmat	132	" I will have the anklet if there is permission , for I have a charm against the ghosts and am not afraid . God is great ! "
33260	33268	33269	33269	he	132	" Do you know who this is ? "
33311	33338	33342	33342	Babalatchi	103	" It was fate . Look at your feet , white man . I can see a ring on those torn fingers which I know well . "
33382	33386	33387	33387	he	103	" Go away , "
33391	33447	33387	33387	he	103	" and send your women to their cooking fires , which they ought not to have left to run after a dead stranger . This is men 's work here . I take him now in the name of the Rajah . Let no man remain here but Tuan Almayer 's slaves . Now go ! "
33560	33571	33573	33573	Almayer	72	" I do not understand what you mean , Babalatchi , "
33575	33606	33607	33607	he	1592	" What is the ring you are talking about ? Whoever he is , you have trodden the poor fellow 's hand right into the mud . Uncover his face , "
33645	33648	33650	33650	Mahmat	132	" Hai ! "
33658	33669	33672	33672	he	1592	" Look , Tuan ; the logs came together so , "
33681	33765	33672	33672	he	1592	" and his head must have been between them , and now there is no face for you to look at . There are his flesh and his bones , the nose , and the lips , and maybe his eyes , but nobody could tell the one from the other . It was written the day he was born that no man could look at him in death and be able to say , ' This is my friend 's face . ' "
33766	33773	33775	33775	Babalatchi	103	" Silence , Mahmat ; enough ! "
33777	33795	33796	33796	he	1592	" and take thy eyes off his anklet , thou eater of pigs flesh . Tuan Almayer , "
33804	33812	33801	33801	his	1592	" have you seen Dain this morning ? "
33822	33825	33826	33826	he	1593	" No , "
33830	33854	33826	33826	he	1593	" have n't you seen him ? Is he not with the Rajah ? I am waiting ; why does he not come ? "
33861	33932	33857	33857	his	103	" He is come , Tuan . He left last night when the storm was great and the river spoke angrily . The night was very black , but he had within him a light that showed the way to your house as smooth as a narrow backwater , and the many logs no bigger than wisps of dried grass . Therefore he went ; and now he lies here . "
33942	33948	33950	33950	Almayer	72	" How can you tell ? "
33990	33995	33996	33996	he	103	" Nobody can tell , "
34043	34049	34050	34050	he	103	" You know this well , "
34053	34078	34050	34050	he	103	" This never left Dain 's hand . I had to tear the flesh now to get it off . Do you believe now ? "
34574	34582	34567	34567	his	103	" Give me some gin ! Run ! "
34709	34731	34694	34694	He	103	" Now all is over , Nina . He is dead , and I may as well burn all my boats . "
34815	34822	34823	34823	she	73	" And so Dain is dead , "
34850	34867	34868	34868	he	103	" You stand there as if you were only half alive , and talk to me , "
34872	35064	34868	34868	he	103	" as if it was a matter of no importance . Yes , he is dead ! Do you understand ? Dead ! What do you care ? You never cared ; you saw me struggle , and work , and strive , unmoved ; and my suffering you could never see . No , never . You have no heart , and you have no mind , or you would have understood that it was for you , for your happiness I was working . I wanted to be rich ; I wanted to get away from here . I wanted to see white men bowing low before the power of your beauty and your wealth . Old as I am I wished to seek a strange land , a civilisation to which I am a stranger , so as to find a new life in the contemplation of your high fortunes , of your triumphs , of your happiness . For that I bore patiently the burden of work , of disappointment , of humiliation amongst these savages here , and I had it all nearly in my grasp . "
35082	35101	35102	35102	He	1607	" Do you hear ? I had it all there ; so ; within reach of my hand . "
35116	35122	35123	35123	he	1607	" Have you no feeling ? "
35127	35134	35123	35123	he	1607	" Have you lived without hope ? "
35153	35194	35195	35195	He	1607	" Are you content to live in this misery and die in this wretched hole ? Say something , Nina ; have you no sympathy ? Have you no word of comfort for me ? I that loved you so . "
35216	35224	35225	35225	he	1607	" I believe you are an idiot ! "
35933	35938	35940	35940	Babalatchi	103	" Lay him there , "
35959	35993	35994	35994	he	103	" Lay him there . He was a Kaffir and the son of a dog , and he was the white man 's friend . He drank the white man 's strong water , "
36001	36008	35994	35994	he	103	" That I have seen myself . "
36119	36126	36128	36128	Nina	73	" You have a bangle there , "
36143	36150	36152	36154	the polite statesman	1634	" I have , Mem Putih , "
36168	36172	36160	36160	he	132	" Come here ! "
36192	36197	36199	36199	Babalatchi	103	" Now , listen , "
36203	36276	36199	36199	Babalatchi	103	" The ring and the anklet you have seen , and you know they belonged to Dain the trader , and to no other . Dain returned last night in a canoe . He spoke with the Rajah , and in the middle of the night left to cross over to the white man 's house . There was a great flood , and this morning you found him in the river . "
36277	36286	36290	36290	his	132	" By his feet I dragged him out , "
36293	36303	36304	36304	he	132	" Tuan Babalatchi , there will be a recompense ! "
36319	36346	36308	36308	Babalatchi	103	" What I have told you , Mahmat , is for all ears . What I give you now is for your eyes only . Take . "
36364	36382	36383	36383	he	132	" Am I a fool to show this thing in a house with three women in it ? "
36386	36404	36383	36383	he	132	" But I shall tell them about Dain the trader , and there will be talk enough . "
36435	36444	36445	36445	he	103	" Have I done well , Mem Putih ? "
36452	36456	36458	36458	Nina	73	" You have , "
36460	36468	36458	36458	Nina	73	" The ring you may keep yourself . "
36660	36682	36653	36653	his	1644	" The boats ! the boats ! The man - of - war 's boats are coming ! They are here ! "
36803	36808	36809	36809	he	103	" Tuan ! Tuan ! "
36814	36843	36809	36809	he	103	" The boats are coming . The man - of- war 's boats . You had better get ready . The officers will come here , I know . "
36859	36863	36846	36846	his	103	" Mem Putih ! "
36869	36884	36885	36885	he	103	" look at him . He does not hear . You must take care , "
37172	37187	37189	37189	Mahmat	132	" By the feet I dragged him in , and there was no head , "
37191	37239	37189	37189	Mahmat	132	" and how could the white man 's wife know who it was ? She was a witch , it was well known . And did you see how the white man himself ran away at the sight of the body ? Like a deer he ran ! "
37276	37281	37282	37282	He	132	" Nothing ! Nothing ! "
37623	37629	37630	37630	he	119	" There are many lies , "
37633	37680	37630	37630	he	119	" He has been dead once before , and came to life to die again now . The Dutch will be here before many days and clamour for the man . Shall I not believe my eyes sooner than the tongues of women and idle men ? "
37681	37695	37697	37697	Abdulla	83	" They say that the body is being taken to Almayer 's compound , "
37699	37735	37697	37697	Abdulla	83	" If you want to go there you must go before the Dutch arrive here . Go late . It should not be said that we have been seen inside that man 's enclosure lately . "
38001	38005	37989	37989	He	119	" Taminah O ! "
38047	38083	38044	38044	he	119	" Are you going to Almayer 's house ? They say in the settlement that Dain the trader , he that was found drowned this morning , is lying in the white man 's campong . "
38084	38091	38093	38093	Taminah	119	" I have heard this talk , "
38095	38116	38093	38093	Taminah	119	" and this morning by the riverside I saw the body . Where it is now I do not know . "
38117	38124	38126	38126	Reshid	119	" So you have seen it ? "
38130	38147	38148	38149	The girl	402	" Is it Dain ? You have seen him many times . You would know him . "
38164	38176	38177	38177	she	402	" I have seen him , not a long time ago , "
38182	38205	38177	38177	she	402	" The talk is true ; he is dead . What do you want from me , Tuan ? I must go . "
38247	38254	38256	38256	Reshid	119	" The Orang Blanda are come , "
38258	38267	38256	38256	Reshid	119	" and now we shall have our reward . "
38274	38285	38286	38286	he	83	" The white men 's rewards are long in coming , "
38289	38305	38286	38286	he	83	" White men are quick in anger and slow in gratitude . We shall see . "
38342	38347	38348	38348	he	83	" Listen , girl , "
38351	38416	38348	38348	he	83	" there will be many white men in Almayer 's house . You shall be there selling your cakes to the men of the sea . What you see and what you hear you may tell me . Come here before the sun sets and I will give you a blue handkerchief with red spots . Now go , and forget not to return . "
38439	38446	38447	38447	he	83	" This slave is very slow , "
39384	39390	39378	39378	he	1768	" Who is that girl ? "
39391	39403	39420	39420	he	1768	" A slave , Tuan ! A girl that sells cakes , "
39457	39463	39464	39464	he	1768	" Do not be afraid , "
42105	42113	42114	42114	he	1876	" He does not seem very dangerous , "
42128	42147	42149	42150	the senior	1879	" No , he seems more of a fool than a knave ; I have heard of him , "
42338	42500	42501	42501	He	1884	" It is a great pleasure to see white faces here . I have lived here many years in great solitude . The Malays , you understand , are not company for a white man ; moreover they are not friendly ; they do not understand our ways . Great rascals they are . I believe I am the only white man on the east coast that is a settled resident . We get visitors from Macassar or Singapore sometimes - traders , agents , or explorers , but they are rare . There was a scientific explorer here a year or more ago . He lived in my house : drank from morning to night . He lived joyously for a few months , and when the liquor he brought with him was gone he returned to Batavia with a report on the mineral wealth of the interior . Ha , ha , ha ! Good , is it not ? "
42526	42547	42517	42517	he	1884	" Dain dead , all my plans destroyed . This is the end of all hope and of all things . "
42562	42568	42570	42571	both officers	1886	" Very good . Capital ! "
42585	42697	42573	42573	Almayer	72	" Eh ! what about the dinner ? You have got a cook with you . That 's all right . There is a cooking shed in the other courtyard . I can give you a goose . Look at my geese - the only geese on the east coast - perhaps on the whole island . Is that your cook ? Very good . Here , Ali , show this Chinaman the cooking place and tell Mem Almayer to let him have room there . My wife , gentlemen , does not come out ; my daughter may . Meantime have some more drink . It is a hot day . "
42722	42732	42733	42733	he	1882	" We have a rather unpleasant business with you , "
42736	42741	42733	42733	he	1882	" I am sorry , "
42745	42755	42733	42733	he	1882	" It can be nothing very serious , surely . "
42756	42784	42786	42787	the officer	1873	" If you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least , not a serious matter you will not find many people of your opinion , "
42790	42802	42804	42804	Almayer	72	" Blow up ! What ? I know nothing about it , "
42806	42817	42804	42804	Almayer	72	" Who did that , or tried to do it ? "
42818	42828	42830	42831	the lieutenant	1882	" A man with whom you had some dealings , "
42833	42857	42830	42831	the lieutenant	1882	" He passed here under the name of Dain Maroola . You sold him the gunpowder he had in that brig we captured . "
42858	42867	42869	42869	Almayer	72	" How did you hear about the brig ? "
42871	42883	42869	42869	Almayer	72	" I know nothing about the powder he may have had . "
42884	42909	42911	42912	the officer	1873	" An Arab trader of this place has sent the information about your goings on here to Batavia , a couple of months ago , "
42914	43061	42911	42912	the officer	1873	" We were waiting for the brig outside , but he slipped past us at the mouth of the river , and we had to chase the fellow to the southward . When he sighted us he ran inside the reefs and put the brig ashore . The crew escaped in boats before we could take possession . As our boats neared the craft it blew up with a tremendous explosion ; one of the boats being too near got swamped . Two men drowned - that is the result of your speculation , Mr. Almayer . Now we want this Dain . We have good grounds to suppose he is hiding in Sambir . Do you know where he is ? You had better put yourself right with the authorities as much as possible by being perfectly frank with me . Where is this Dain ? "
43254	43274	43276	43277	the lieutenant	1882	" Well , Mr. Almayer , will you answer my question as frankly as it is put to you ? "
43294	43307	43308	43308	he	95	" If you catch this Dain what will you do with him ? "
43317	43324	43325	43325	he	1873	" This is not an answer , "
43330	43339	43342	43342	Almayer	72	" And what will you do with me ? "
43349	43356	43358	43359	the other	343	" Are you inclined to bargain ? "
43361	43392	43358	43359	the other	343	" It would be bad policy , I assure you . At present I have no orders about your person , but we expected your assistance in catching this Malay . "
43393	43396	43398	43398	Almayer	72	" Ah ! "
43400	43427	43398	43398	Almayer	72	" just so : you can do nothing without me , and I , knowing the man well , am to help you in finding him . "
43428	43436	43438	43439	the officer	1873	" This is exactly what we expect , "
43441	43458	43438	43439	the officer	1873	" You have broken the law , Mr. Almayer , and you ought to make amends . "
43459	43464	43398	43398	Almayer	72	" And save myself ? "
43465	43481	43483	43484	the lieutenant	1882	" Well , in a sense yes . Your head is not in any danger , "
43491	43495	43497	43497	Almayer	72	" Very well , "
43502	43512	43497	43497	Almayer	72	" I shall deliver the man up to you . "
43537	43542	43543	43543	he	1906	" Steady , gentlemen ! "
43546	43567	43543	43543	he	1906	" In my own time and in my own way . After dinner , gentlemen , you shall have him . "
43568	43573	43575	43576	the lieutenant	1882	" This is preposterous , "
43578	43612	43575	43576	the lieutenant	1882	" Mr. Almayer , this is no joking matter . The man is a criminal . He deserves to hang . While we dine he may escape ; the rumour of our arrival - "
43619	43642	43613	43613	Almayer	72	" I give you my word of honour , gentlemen , that he shall not escape ; I have him safe enough . "
43643	43652	43654	43656	the young sub	1908	" The arrest should be effected before dark , "
43658	43681	43683	43684	the senior	1879	" I shall hold you responsible for any failure . We are ready , but can do nothing just now without you , "
43697	43704	43705	43705	he	1910	" On my word of honour , "
43709	43716	43717	43717	he	1910	" And now let us dine , "
43757	43761	43763	43763	Almayer	72	" Allow me , "
43767	43794	43763	43763	Almayer	72	" This is my daughter . Nina , these gentlemen , officers of the frigate outside , have done me the honour to accept my hospitality . "
43840	43853	43855	43856	the lieutenant	1882	" You will allow me to have this put upon the table ? "
43860	43882	43855	43856	the lieutenant	1882	" What ! Wine ! You are very kind . Certainly , I have none myself . Times are very hard . "
43977	43985	43986	43986	he	408	" She was very beautiful and imposing , "
43989	43999	43986	43986	he	408	" but after all a half - caste girl . "
44062	44100	44059	44060	CHAPTER IX	140	" Can I believe what you tell me ? It is like a tale for men that listen only half awake by the camp fire , and it seems to have run off a woman 's tongue . "
44101	44114	44116	44116	Babalatchi	103	" Who is there here for me to deceive , O Rajah ? "
44118	44177	44116	44116	Babalatchi	103	" Without you I am nothing . All I have told you I believe to be true . I have been safe for many years in the hollow of your hand . This is no time to harbour suspicions . The danger is very great . We should advise and act at once , before the sun sets . "
44178	44183	44185	44185	Lakamba	85	" Right . Right , "
44300	44311	44313	44313	Lakamba	85	" And where did you say he is hiding now ? "
44336	44479	44480	44480	He	1929	" In Bulangi 's clearing - the furthest one , away from the house . They went there that very night . The white man 's daughter took him there . She told me so herself , speaking to me openly , for she is half white and has no decency . She said she was waiting for him while he was here ; then , after a long time , he came out of the darkness and fell at her feet exhausted . He lay like one dead , but she brought him back to life in her arms , and made him breathe again with her own breath . That is what she said , speaking to my face , as I am speaking now to you , Rajah . She is like a white woman and knows no shame . "
44491	44497	44498	44498	he	85	" Well , and then ? "
44501	44508	44511	44511	Babalatchi	103	" They called the old woman , "
44513	44590	44511	44511	Babalatchi	103	" and he told them all - about the brig , and how he tried to kill many men . He knew the Orang Blanda were very near , although he had said nothing to us about that ; he knew his great danger . He thought he had killed many , but there were only two dead , as I have heard from the men of the sea that came in the warship 's boats . "
44591	44605	44607	44607	Lakamba	85	" And the other man , he that was found in the river ? "
44609	44801	44607	44607	Lakamba	85	" That was one of his boatmen . When his canoe was overturned by the logs those two swam together , but the other man must have been hurt . Dain swam , holding him up . He left him in the bushes when he went up to the house . When they all came down his heart had ceased to beat ; then the old woman spoke ; Dain thought it was good . He took off his anklet and broke it , twisting it round the man 's foot . His ring he put on that slave 's hand . He took off his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted no clothes , the two women holding it up meanwhile , their intent being to deceive all eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement , so that they could swear to the thing that was not , and that there could be no treachery when the white - men came . Then Dain and the white woman departed to call up Bulangi and find a hiding - place . The old woman remained by the body . "
44802	44805	44807	44807	Lakamba	85	" Hai ! "
44809	44814	44807	44807	Lakamba	85	" She has wisdom . "
44815	44832	44834	44834	Babalatchi	103	" Yes , she has a Devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear , "
44836	44976	44834	44834	Babalatchi	103	" She dragged the body with great toil to the point where many logs were stranded . All these things were done in the darkness after the storm had passed away . Then she waited . At the first sign of daylight she battered the face of the dead with a heavy stone , and she pushed him amongst the logs . She remained near , watching . At sunrise Mahmat Banjer came and found him . They all believed ; I myself was deceived , but not for long . The white man believed , and , grieving , fled to his house . When we were alone I , having doubts , spoke to the woman , and she , fearing my anger and your might , told me all , asking for help in saving Dain . "
44977	44990	44992	44992	Lakamba	85	" He must not fall into the hands of the Orang Blanda , "
44994	45008	44992	44992	Lakamba	85	" but let him die , if the thing can be done quietly . "
45009	45067	44834	44834	Babalatchi	103	" It can not , Tuan ! Remember there is that woman who , being half white , is ungovernable , and would raise a great outcry . Also the officers are here . They are angry enough already . Dain must escape ; he must go . We must help him now for our own safety . "
45068	45075	45077	45077	Lakamba	85	" Are the officers very angry ? "
45082	45111	45113	45113	Babalatchi	103	" They are . The principal chief used strong words when speaking to me - to me when I salaamed in your name . I do not think , "
45124	45165	45113	45113	Babalatchi	103	" I do not think I saw a white chief so angry before . He said we were careless or even worse . He told me he would speak to the Rajah , and that I was of no account . "
45166	45172	45174	45174	Lakamba	85	" Speak to the Rajah ! "
45178	45200	45206	45206	Babalatchi	103	" Listen , Babalatchi : I am sick , and shall withdraw ; you cross over and tell the white men . "
45201	45204	45206	45206	Babalatchi	103	" Yes , "
45208	45221	45206	45206	Babalatchi	103	" I am going over at once ; and as to Dain ? "
45222	45241	45243	45243	Lakamba	85	" You get him away as you can best . This is a great trouble in my heart , "
45260	45391	45206	45206	Babalatchi	103	" There is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river . The Dutch warship is to the northward watching the main entrance . I shall send Dain off to - night in a canoe , by the hidden channels , on board the prau . His father is a great prince , and shall hear of our generosity . Let the prau take him to Ampanam . Your glory shall be great , and your reward in powerful friendship . Almayer will no doubt deliver the dead body as Dain 's to the officers , and the foolish white men shall say , ' This is very good ; let there be peace . ' And the trouble shall be removed from your heart , Rajah . "
45392	45397	45399	45399	Lakamba	85	" True ! true ! "
45401	45477	45399	45399	Lakamba	85	" And , this being accomplished by me who am your slave , you shall reward with a generous hand . That I know ! The white man is grieving for the lost treasure , in the manner of white men who thirst after dollars . Now , when all other things are in order , we shall perhaps obtain the treasure from the white man . Dain must escape , and Almayer must live . "
45478	45486	45488	45488	Lakamba	85	" Now go , Babalatchi , go ! "
45495	45511	45488	45488	Lakamba	85	" I am very sick , and want medicine . Tell the white chief so . "
46312	46314	46269	46269	he	1085	" amok "
46649	46655	46657	46657	Babalatchi	103	" Who 's that hiding ? "
46659	46667	46657	46657	Babalatchi	103	" Come out and speak to me . "
46698	46705	46706	46706	he	119	" What are you doing here ? "
46711	46732	46706	46706	he	119	" I have nearly stepped on your tray . Am I a Dyak that you should hide at my sight ? "
46733	46743	46745	46745	Taminah	119	" I was weary , and - I slept , "
46749	46772	46774	46774	Babalatchi	103	" You slept ! You have not sold anything to - day , and you will be beaten when you return home , "
46810	46820	46821	46821	he	103	" Now you go home . It is late , "
46825	46880	46821	46821	he	103	" Tell Bulangi that I shall be near his house before the night is half over , and that I want him to make all things ready for a long journey . You understand ? A long journey to the southward . Tell him that before sunset , and do not forget my words . "
47047	47054	47056	47056	Babalatchi	103	" Where are the white men ? "
47058	47067	47069	47069	Ali	95	" They are eating in the front verandah , "
47071	47091	47069	47069	Ali	95	" Do not stop me , Tuan . I am giving the white men their food and am busy . "
47092	47098	47056	47056	Babalatchi	103	" Where 's Mem Almayer ? "
47099	47112	47113	47113	Ali	95	" Inside in the passage . She is listening to the talk . "
47181	47184	47185	47185	she	72	" Listen , "
47188	47194	47185	47185	she	72	" He has drunk much . "
47195	47199	47201	47201	Babalatchi	103	" He has , "
47203	47212	47201	47201	Babalatchi	103	" He will sleep heavily to - night . "
47218	47249	47251	47252	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake , and he walks up and down the verandah all night , cursing ; then we stand afar off , "
47267	47300	47251	47252	Mrs. Almayer	72	" But then he does not hear , nor understand , and his hand , of course , has no strength . We do not want him to hear to - night . "
47301	47304	47306	47307	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , "
47318	47326	47306	47307	Mrs. Almayer	72	" If he hears he will kill . "
47331	47396	47401	47401	she	72	" Hai Tuan , you may believe me . Have I not lived many years with that man ? Have I not seen death in that man 's eyes more than once when I was younger and he guessed at many things . Had he been a man of my own people I would not have seen such a look twice ; but he - "
47418	47435	47437	47437	Babalatchi	103	" If he has the wish but not the strength , then what do we fear ? "
47463	47469	47471	47471	Babalatchi	103	" What do we fear ? "
47474	47493	47495	47496	Mrs. Almayer	72	" To keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your heart and mine without hesitation , "
47498	47520	47495	47496	Mrs. Almayer	72	" When the girl is gone he will be like the devil unchained . Then you and I had better beware . "
47521	47532	47534	47534	Babalatchi	103	" I am an old man and fear not death , "
47543	47550	47534	47534	Babalatchi	103	" But what will you do ? "
47551	47563	47565	47566	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I am an old woman , and wish to live , "
47568	47602	47565	47566	Mrs. Almayer	72	" She is my daughter also . I shall seek safety at the feet of our Rajah , speaking in the name of the past when we both were young , and he - "
47608	47616	47617	47617	he	103	" Enough . You shall be protected , "
47818	47826	47828	47829	Mrs. Almayer	72	" This is the devil of gin , "
47831	47847	47828	47829	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Yes ; he talks like that sometimes when there is nobody to hear him . "
47848	47854	47856	47856	Babalatchi	103	" What does he say ? "
47860	47866	47856	47856	Babalatchi	103	" You ought to understand . "
47867	47920	47828	47829	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I have forgotten their talk . A little I understood . He spoke without any respect of the white ruler in Batavia , and of protection , and said he had been wronged ; he said that several times . More I did not understand . Listen ! Again he speaks ! "
47921	47928	47930	47930	Babalatchi	103	" Tse ! tse ! tse ! "
47947	48012	47943	47943	his	103	" There will be great trouble between those white men . I will go round now and see . You tell your daughter that there is a sudden and a long journey before her , with much glory and splendour at the end . And tell her that Dain must go , or he must die , and that he will not go alone . "
48013	48022	48025	48026	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , he will not go alone , "
48223	48286	48218	48218	Almayer	72	" . . . disloyalty and unscrupulousness ! What have you ever done to make me loyal ? You have no grip on this country . I had to take care of myself , and when I asked for protection I was met with threats and contempt , and had Arab slander thrown in my face . I ! a white man ! "
48287	48295	48297	48298	the lieutenant	1882	" Do n't be violent , Almayer , "
48300	48308	48297	48298	the lieutenant	1882	" I have heard all this already . "
48309	48352	48353	48353	He	1882	" Then why do you talk to me about scruples ? I wanted money , and I gave powder in exchange . How could I know that some of your wretched men were going to be blown up ? Scruples ! Pah ! "
48371	48376	48377	48377	he	1882	" No more wine , "
48381	48389	48391	48392	the lieutenant	1882	" You have had enough , Almayer , "
48400	48452	48395	48395	he	1882	" Is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner ? I take it you have that Dain Maroola stowed away safely somewhere . Still we had better get that business over , and then we shall have more drink . Come ! do n't look at me like this . "
48468	48471	48472	48472	he	1882	" Gold , "
48477	48511	48472	48472	he	1882	" Hem ! A hand on the windpipe , you know . Sure you will excuse . I wanted to say - a little gold for a little powder . What 's that ? "
48512	48519	48521	48522	the lieutenant	1882	" I know , I know , "
48525	48539	48541	48541	Almayer	72	" No ! You do n't know . Not one of you knows ! "
48543	48579	48541	48541	Almayer	72	" The government is a fool , I tell you . Heaps of gold . I am the man that knows ; I and another one . But he wo n't speak . He is - "
48610	48618	48619	48619	he	2031	" Personally you are a fine fellow , "
48649	48655	48657	48658	the lieutenant	1882	" This wo n't do , "
48664	48711	48657	48658	the lieutenant	1882	" Have the men mustered in the compound here . I must get some sense out of him . Hi ! Almayer ! Wake up , man . Redeem your word . You gave your word . You gave your word of honour , you know . "
48746	48759	48760	48760	he	1882	" You are very young ; there is time for all things , "
48789	48803	48804	48804	he	1882	" Really I am very much distressed by all this for your sake , "
48807	48813	48814	48814	he	1882	" I do not know ; "
48823	48897	48898	48898	He	1882	" whether I have any right to ask you anything , unless , perhaps , to withdraw from this painful scene , but I feel that I must - for your father 's good - suggest that you should - I mean if you have any influence over him you ought to exert it now to make him keep the promise he gave me before he - before he got into this state . "
48922	48926	48927	48927	he	1882	" I trust - "
48931	48940	48927	48927	he	1882	" What is the promise you speak of ? "
48954	49042	48927	48927	he	1882	" Nothing that is not just and proper . He promised to deliver to us a man who in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent men to escape the punishment he deserved for breaking the law . He planned his mischief on a large scale . It is not his fault if it failed , partially . Of course you have heard of Dain Maroola . Your father secured him , I understand . We know he escaped up this river . Perhaps you - "
49043	49050	49052	49052	Nina	73	" And he killed white men ! "
49054	49077	49052	49052	Nina	73	" I regret to say they were white . Yes , two white men lost their lives through that scoundrel 's freak . "
49078	49082	49084	49084	Nina	73	" Two only ! "
49094	49101	49102	49102	he	1873	" Why ! why ! You - "
49107	49114	49116	49116	Nina	73	" There might have been more , "
49118	49131	49132	49133	The lieutenant	1882	" And when you get this - this scoundrel will you go ? "
49142	49161	49162	49162	she	73	" Then I would get him for you if I had to seek him in a burning fire , "
49169	49226	49227	49227	she	73	" I hate the sight of your white faces . I hate the sound of your gentle voices . That is the way you speak to women , dropping sweet words before any pretty face . I have heard your voices before . I hoped to live here without seeing any other white face but this , "
49354	49361	49363	49363	Almayer	72	" You are a good girl , "
49373	49378	49379	49379	she	73	" Father ! father ! "
49389	49423	49379	49379	she	73	" See those two men looking at us . Send them away . I can not bear it any more . Send them away . Do what they want and let them go . "
49460	49470	49472	49474	the younger man	2055	" What has happened ? What is the matter ? "
49476	49481	49483	49484	the other	343	" Do n't know , "
49490	49513	49487	49487	his	343	" One is furious , and the other is drunk . Not so drunk , either . Queer , this . Look ! "
49564	49570	49572	49573	the lieutenant	1882	" Are the men ready ? "
49575	49581	49572	49573	the lieutenant	1882	" All ready , sir . "
49582	49592	49594	49595	the lieutenant	1882	" Now , Mr. Almayer , lead the way , "
49612	49616	49617	49617	he	408	" Two men , "
49651	49655	49656	49656	he	408	" Two men , "
49664	49688	49656	49656	he	408	" Two white men - men in uniform - honourable men . I want to say - men of honour . Are you ? "
49689	49696	49698	49699	the officer	1873	" Come ! None of that , "
49702	49711	49698	49699	the officer	1873	" Let us have that friend of yours . "
49712	49720	49722	49722	Almayer	72	" What do you think I am ? "
49726	49749	49751	49752	the officer	1873	" You are drunk , but not so drunk as not to know what you are doing . Enough of this tomfoolery , "
49755	49769	49751	49752	the officer	1873	" or I will have you put under arrest in your own house . "
49770	49773	49775	49775	Almayer	72	" Arrest ! "
49779	49825	49775	49775	Almayer	72	" Ha ! ha ! ha ! Arrest ! Why , I have been trying to get out of this infernal place for twenty years , and I ca n't . You hear , man ! I ca n't , and never shall ! Never ! "
49866	49873	49875	49876	the officer	1873	" That 's better , Almayer , "
49879	49894	49895	49895	he	1873	" Where are you going to ? There are only planks there . Here , "
49903	49910	49895	49895	he	1873	" do we want the boats ? "
49911	49914	49916	49916	Almayer	72	" No , "
49920	49926	49916	49916	Almayer	72	" You want a grave . "
49927	49938	49895	49895	he	1873	" What ? Wild again ! Try to talk sense . "
49939	49942	49944	49944	Almayer	72	" Grave ! "
49952	49980	49944	49944	Almayer	72	" A hole in the ground . Do n't you understand ? You must be drunk . Let me go ! Let go , I tell you ! "
50151	50154	50155	50155	he	2063	" There ! "
50160	50172	50155	50155	he	2063	" Are you all there ? He is a dangerous man . "
50199	50205	50207	50207	Almayer	72	" Cold , perfectly cold , "
50216	50238	50239	50239	he	2063	" Sorry can do no better . And you ca n't hang him , either . As you observe , gentlemen , "
50243	50254	50239	50239	he	2063	" there is no head , and hardly any neck . "
50301	50306	50239	50239	he	2063	" This is Dain , "
50318	50373	50374	50374	he	2063	" And I have kept my word . First one hope , then another , and this is my last . Nothing is left now . You think there is one dead man here ? Mistake , I ' sure you . I am much more dead . Why do n't you hang me ? "
50387	50406	50374	50374	he	2063	" I assure , assure you it would be a mat - matter of form altog - altogether . "
50422	50426	50427	50427	he	2063	" Get out ! "
50577	50582	50571	50571	Sambir	123	" Almayer 's Folly . "
50859	50863	50865	50866	the lieutenant	1882	" Ten o'clock , "
50875	50896	50865	50866	the lieutenant	1882	" I shall hear some of the captain 's complimentary remarks when we get back . Miserable business , this . "
50897	50906	50908	50910	the younger man	2055	" Do you think all this is true ? "
50912	50977	50908	50910	the younger man	2055	" True ! It is just possible . But if it is n't true what can we do ? If we had a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks ; and that would n't be much good . That drunken madman was right ; we have n't enough hold on this coast . They do what they like . Are our hammocks slung ? "
50978	50991	50993	50994	the sub	2098	" Yes , I told the coxswain . Strange couple over there , "
51007	51032	51000	51000	his	2098	" Hem ! Queer , certainly . What have you been telling her ? I was attending to the father most of the time . "
51033	51043	51045	51047	the other warmly	2100	" I assure you I have been perfectly civil , "
51049	51085	51045	51047	the other warmly	2100	" All right . Do n't get excited . She objects to civility , then , from what I understand . I thought you might have been tender . You know we are on service . "
51086	51103	51104	51104	They	2101	" Well , of course . Never forget that . Coldly civil . That 's all . "
51217	51223	51224	51224	he	2055	" Did you hear that ? "
51227	51230	51232	51233	the other	343	" No ! "
51235	51239	51232	51233	the other	343	" Hear what ? "
51240	51270	51276	51277	the lieutenant	1882	" I thought I heard a cry . Ever so faint . Seemed a woman 's voice . In that other house . Ah ! Again ! Hear it ? "
51271	51274	51276	51277	the lieutenant	1882	" No , "
51283	51311	51276	51277	the lieutenant	1882	" You young fellows always hear women 's voices . If you are going to dream you had better get into your hammock . Good - night . "
51338	51345	51347	51347	Nina	73	" It has set at last , "
51362	51383	51384	51384	She	73	" Listen , mother , I am going now to Bulangi 's creek , and if I should never return - "
51717	51725	51727	51728	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , you will not return , "
51732	51746	51747	51747	She	73	" Without you he will not go , and if he remains here - "
51755	51760	51749	51749	her	73	" Almayer 's Folly , "
51874	51885	51886	51886	she	72	" You are going away to be a great Ranee , "
51900	51980	51886	51886	she	72	" and if you be wise you shall have much power that will endure many days , and even last into your old age . What have I been ? A slave all my life , and I have cooked rice for a man who had no courage and no wisdom . Hai ! I ! even I , was given in gift by a chief and a warrior to a man that was neither . Hai ! Hai ! "
52124	52137	52140	52141	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I was a slave , and you shall be a queen , "
52148	52192	52140	52141	Mrs. Almayer	72	" but remember men 's strength and their weakness . Tremble before his anger , so that he may see your fear in the light of day ; but in your heart you may laugh , for after sunset he is your slave . "
52193	52212	52213	52214	Mrs. Almayer	72	" A slave ! He ! The master of life ! You do not know him , mother . "
52220	52231	52232	52232	she	72	" You speak like a fool of a white woman , "
52235	52299	52232	52232	she	72	" What do you know of men 's anger and of men 's love ? Have you watched the sleep of men weary of dealing death ? Have you felt about you the strong arm that could drive a kriss deep into a beating heart ? Yah ! you are a white woman , and ought to pray to a woman - god ! "
52300	52354	52140	52141	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Why do you say this ? I have listened to your words so long that I have forgotten my old life . If I was white would I stand here , ready to go ? Mother , I shall return to the house and look once more at my father 's face . "
52355	52358	52360	52361	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No ! "
52365	52414	52360	52361	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , he sleeps now the sleep of gin ; and if you went back he might awake and see you . No , he shall never see you . When the terrible old man took you away from me when you were little , you remember - "
52415	52424	52426	52426	Nina	73	" It was such a long time ago , "
52428	52432	52435	52436	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I remember , "
52440	52497	52435	52436	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I wanted to look at your face again . He said no ! I heard you cry and jumped into the river . You were his daughter then ; you are my daughter now . Never shall you go back to that house ; you shall never cross this courtyard again . No ! no ! "
52537	52542	52544	52544	Nina	73	" I shall go , "
52553	52564	52565	52565	She	72	" What is your hate or your revenge to me ? "
52583	52591	52592	52592	she	72	" Stop , you shall not go ! "
52627	52634	52635	52635	she	72	" If you move another step , "
52641	52683	52684	52684	she	72	" I shall cry out . Do you see those lights in the big house ? There sit two white men , angry because they can not have the blood of the man you love . And in those dark houses , "
52696	52719	52684	52684	she	72	" my voice could wake up men that would lead the Orang Blanda soldiers to him who is waiting - for you . "
52749	52758	52759	52759	she	72	" Give up your old life ! Forget ! "
52765	52854	52759	52759	she	72	" Forget that you ever looked at a white face ; forget their words ; forget their thoughts . They speak lies . And they think lies because they despise us that are better than they are , but not so strong . Forget their friendship and their contempt ; forget their many gods . Girl , why do you want to remember the past when there is a warrior and a chief ready to give many lives - his own life - for one of your smiles ? "
53281	53284	53285	53285	she	72	" Quick , "
53288	53333	53285	53285	she	72	" get away before the moon rises , while the river is dark . I am afraid of Abdulla 's slaves . The wretches prowl in the night often , and might see and follow you . There are two paddles in the canoe . "
53368	53378	53380	53380	Nina	73	" Shall I ever see you again , mother ? "
53382	53385	53387	53388	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , "
53395	53446	53387	53388	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Why should you return here where it is my fate to die ? You will live far away in splendour and might . When I hear of white men driven from the islands , then I shall know that you are alive , and that you remember my words . "
53447	53453	53455	53455	Nina	73	" I shall always remember , "
53459	53472	53455	53455	Nina	73	" but where is my power , and what can I do ? "
53473	53560	53562	53562	she	2152	" Do not let him look too long in your eyes , nor lay his head on your knees without reminding him that men should fight before they rest . And if he lingers , give him his kriss yourself and bid him go , as the wife of a mighty prince should do when the enemies are near . Let him slay the white men that come to us to trade , with prayers on their lips and loaded guns in their hands . Ah ! "
53568	53586	53587	53587	She	2152	" they are on every sea , and on every shore ; and they are very many ! "
53634	53641	53642	53642	she	73	" What is it , mother ? "
53650	53656	53642	53642	she	73	" Do you hear anything ? "
53657	53660	53662	53663	Mrs. Almayer	72	" No , "
53667	53672	53673	53673	she	2152	" Listen , Nina , "
53683	53693	53673	53673	she	2152	" in after years there will be other women - "
53754	53761	53762	53762	she	2152	" There will be other women , "
53766	53872	53762	53762	she	2152	" I tell you that , because you are half white , and may forget that he is a great chief , and that such things must be . Hide your anger , and do not let him see on your face the pain that will eat your heart . Meet him with joy in your eyes and wisdom on your lips , for to you he will turn in sadness or in doubt . As long as he looks upon many women your power will last , but should there be one , one only with whom he seems to forget you , then - "
53873	53879	53881	53881	Nina	73	" I could not live , "
53891	53904	53881	53881	Nina	73	" Do not speak so , mother ; it could not be . "
53905	53908	53911	53912	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Then , "
53916	53927	53911	53912	Mrs. Almayer	72	" to that woman , Nina , show no mercy . "
53955	53960	53961	53961	she	72	" Are you crying ? "
53975	54010	53961	53961	she	72	" Arise , and take your paddle , for he has waited long enough . And remember , Nina , no mercy ; and if you must strike , strike with a steady hand . "
54182	54187	54188	54188	she	72	" Who is there ? "
54211	54216	54217	54217	she	72	" Who is there ? "
54355	54360	54362	54364	the anxious statesman	1427	" Is she gone ? "
54368	54371	54373	54374	Mrs. Almayer	72	" Yes , "
54376	54390	54373	54374	Mrs. Almayer	72	" What are the white men doing ? When did you leave them ? "
54391	54405	54407	54407	Babalatchi	103	" They are sleeping now , I think . May they never wake ! "
54411	54459	54460	54460	he	103	" Oh ! but they are devils , and made much talk and trouble over that carcase . The chief threatened me twice with his hand , and said he would have me tied up to a tree . Tie me up to a tree ! Me ! "
54473	54495	54468	54469	Mrs. Almayer	72	" And you salaamed and asked for mercy . Men with arms by their side acted otherwise when I was young . "
54496	54512	54514	54514	Babalatchi	103	" And where are they , the men of your youth ? You mad woman ! "
54518	54558	54514	54514	Babalatchi	103	" Killed by the Dutch . Aha ! But I shall live to deceive them . A man knows when to fight and when to tell peaceful lies . You would know that if you were not a woman . "
54587	54593	54594	54594	she	72	" There are strange sounds , "
54601	54632	54594	54594	she	72	" I have heard in the air the sounds of grief , as of a sigh and weeping . That was by the riverside . And now again I heard - "
54633	54636	54638	54638	Babalatchi	103	" Where ? "
54645	54651	54638	54638	Babalatchi	103	" What did you hear ? "
54652	54679	54594	54594	she	72	" Close here . It was like a breath long drawn . I wish I had burnt the paper over the body before it was buried . "
54680	54683	54685	54685	Babalatchi	103	" Yes , "
54687	54711	54712	54712	he	103	" But the white men had him thrown into a hole at once . You know he found his death on the river , "
54716	54732	54712	54712	he	103	" and his ghost may hail the canoes , but would leave the land alone . "
54756	54762	54763	54763	she	72	" There is nobody there , "
54768	54785	54763	54763	she	72	" Is it not time for the Rajah war - canoe to go to the clearing ? "
54786	54801	54803	54803	Babalatchi	103	" I have been waiting for it here , for I myself must go , "
54805	54830	54803	54803	Babalatchi	103	" I think I will go over and see what makes them late . When will you come ? The Rajah gives you refuge . "
54831	54850	54852	54853	Mrs. Almayer	72	" I shall paddle over before the break of day . I can not leave my dollars behind , "
55813	55818	55819	55819	he	571	" What ? What ? "
55860	55873	55874	55874	he	571	" Am I awake ? - Why do I hear the voices ? "
55882	55934	55935	55935	He	571	" I can not get rid of the horrible nightmare yet . - I have been very drunk . - What is that shaking me ? I am dreaming yet - I must open my eyes and be done with it . I am only half awake , it is evident . "
56367	56396	56357	56357	he	571	" Oh ! the fiendish noise that split his head and seemed to choke his breath . - It would kill him . - It must be stopped ! "
56515	56521	56522	56522	he	571	" Do n't be afraid , "
56528	56564	56522	56522	he	571	" I shall not hurt you . Why do you come to my house in the night ? And if you had to come , why not go behind the curtain where the women sleep ? "
56565	56574	56576	56576	Taminah	119	" The place behind the curtain is empty , "
56585	56623	56576	56576	Taminah	119	" There are no women in your house any more , Tuan . I saw the old Mem go away before I tried to wake you . I did not want your women , I wanted you . "
56624	56628	56630	56630	Almayer	72	" Old Mem ! "
56632	56639	56630	56630	Almayer	72	" Do you mean my wife ? "
56645	56655	56657	56657	Almayer	72	" But of my daughter you are not afraid ? "
56659	56666	56667	56667	she	402	" Have you not heard me ? "
56670	56693	56667	56667	she	402	" Have I not spoken for a long time when you lay there with eyes half open ? She is gone too . "
56694	56712	56667	56667	she	402	" I was asleep . Can you not tell when a man is sleeping and when awake ? "
56713	56716	56718	56718	Taminah	119	" Sometimes , "
56799	56800	56795	56795	you	119	" "
56820	56859	56814	56814	you	119	" He took her by the shoulder and led her unresisting to the front of the verandah into a stronger light . She wrung her hands with such an appearance of grief that he began to be alarmed . "
56862	56866	56867	56867	You	119	" he said . "
56883	56893	56879	56880	nobody living	2212	" he added to himself in an uneasy whisper . "
56900	57355	57357	57357	you	2213	" he repeated . In a rush of words which broke out after a short struggle from her trembling lips she told him the tale of Nina 's love and her own jealousy . Several times he looked angrily into her face and told her to be silent ; but he could not stop the sounds that seemed to him to run out in a hot stream , swirl about his feet , and rise in scalding waves about him , higher , higher , drowning his heart , touching his lips with a feel of molten lead , blotting out his sight in scorching vapour , closing over his head , merciless and deadly . When she spoke of the deception as to Dain 's death of which he had been the victim only that day , he glanced again at her with terrible eyes , and made her falter for a second , but he turned away directly , and his face suddenly lost all expression in a stony stare far away over the river . Ah ! the river ! His old friend and his old enemy , speaking always with the same voice as he runs from year to year bringing fortune or disappointment happiness or pain , upon the same varying but unchanged surface of glancing currents and swirling eddies . For many years he had listened to the passionless and soothing murmur that sometimes was the song of hope , at times the song of triumph , of encouragement ; more often the whisper of consolation that spoke of better days to come . For so many years ! So many years ! And now to the accompaniment of that murmur he listened to the slow and painful beating of his heart . He listened attentively , wondering at the regularity of its beats . He began to count mechanically . One , two . Why count ? At the next beat it must stop . No heart could suffer so and beat so steadily for long . Those regular strokes as of a muffled hammer that rang in his ears must stop soon . Still beating unceasing and cruel . No man can bear this ; and is this the last , or will the next one be the last ? - How much longer ? O God ! how much longer ? His hand weighed heavier unconsciously on the girl 's shoulder , and she spoke the last words of her story crouching at his feet with tears of pain and shame and anger . Was her revenge to fail her ? This white man was like a senseless stone . Too late ! Too late ! "
57362	57372	57357	57357	you	2213	" Almayer 's voice sounded harshly above her head . "
57379	57393	57374	57374	I	0	" she sobbed , trying to wriggle gently out from under his grip . "
57446	57477	57439	57440	the witchwoman	2215	" She sank lower yet on her elbow , turning half round under the downward push of the heavy hand , her face lifted up to him with spiteful eyes . "
57482	57498	57479	57479	she	2215	" she shouted out in a half - laugh , half - cry of pain . "
57529	57556	57525	57527	the deceitful woman	2219	" Almayer dragged her up to her feet and looked close into her face while she struggled , turning her head away from his wild stare . "
57565	57571	57572	57572	I	0	" he asked , violently . "
57581	57626	57578	57578	You	2213	" He straightened his arm suddenly and flung her across the verandah towards the doorway , where she lay immobile and silent , as if she had left her life in his grasp , a dark heap , without a sound or a stir . "
57631	57649	57652	57652	Nina	73	" whispered Almayer , in a voice in which reproach and love spoke together in pained tenderness . "
57659	57721	57722	57722	Nina	73	" A light draught from the river ran over the courtyard in a wave of bowing grass and , entering the verandah , touched Almayer 's forehead with its cool breath , in a caress of infinite pity . The curtain in the women 's doorway blew out and instantly collapsed with startling helplessness . He stared at the fluttering stuff . "
57724	57728	57722	57722	Nina	73	" cried Almayer . "
57735	61620	57733	57733	Nina	73	" The wind passed out of the empty house in a tremulous sigh , and all was still . Almayer hid his face in his hands as if to shut out a loathsome sight . When , hearing a slight rustle , he uncovered his eyes , the dark heap by the door was gone . CHAPTER XI . In the middle of a shadowless square of moonlight , shining on a smooth and level expanse of young rice - shoots , a little shelter - hut perched on high posts , the pile of brushwood near by and the glowing embers of a fire with a man stretched before it , seemed very small and as if lost in the pale green iridescence reflected from the ground . On three sides of the clearing , appearing very far away in the deceptive light , the big trees of the forest , lashed together with manifold bonds by a mass of tangled creepers , looked down at the growing young life at their feet with the sombre resignation of giants that had lost faith in their strength . And in the midst of them the merciless creepers clung to the big trunks in cable - like coils , leaped from tree to tree , hung in thorny festoons from the lower boughs , and , sending slender tendrils on high to seek out the smallest branches , carried death to their victims in an exulting riot of silent destruction . On the fourth side , following the curve of the bank of that branch of the Pantai that formed the only access to the clearing , ran a black line of young trees , bushes , and thick second growth , unbroken save for a small gap chopped out in one place . At that gap began the narrow footpath leading from the water 's edge to the grass - built shelter used by the night watchers when the ripening crop had to be protected from the wild pigs . The pathway ended at the foot of the piles on which the hut was built , in a circular space covered with ashes and bits of burnt wood . In the middle of that space , by the dim fire , lay Dain . He turned over on his side with an impatient sigh , and , pillowing his head on his bent arm , lay quietly with his face to the dying fire . The glowing embers shone redly in a small circle , throwing a gleam into his wide - open eyes , and at every deep breath the fine white ash of bygone fires rose in a light cloud before his parted lips , and danced away from the warm glow into the moonbeams pouring down upon Bulangi 's clearing . His body was weary with the exertion of the past few days , his mind more weary still with the strain of solitary waiting for his fate . Never before had he felt so helpless . He had heard the report of the gun fired on board the launch , and he knew that his life was in untrustworthy hands , and that his enemies were very near . During the slow hours of the afternoon he roamed about on the edge of the forest , or , hiding in the bushes , watched the creek with unquiet eyes for some sign of danger . He feared not death , yet he desired ardently to live , for life to him was Nina . She had promised to come , to follow him , to share his danger and his splendour . But with her by his side he cared not for danger , and without her there could be no splendour and no joy in existence . Crouching in his shady hiding - place , he closed his eyes , trying to evoke the gracious and charming image of the white figure that for him was the beginning and the end of life . With eyes shut tight , his teeth hard set , he tried in a great effort of passionate will to keep his hold on that vision of supreme delight . In vain ! His heart grew heavy as the figure of Nina faded away to be replaced by another vision this time - a vision of armed men , of angry faces , of glittering arms - and he seemed to hear the hum of excited and triumphant voices as they discovered him in his hiding - place . Startled by the vividness of his fancy , he would open his eyes , and , leaping out into the sunlight , resume his aimless wanderings around the clearing . As he skirted in his weary march the edge of the forest he glanced now and then into its dark shade , so enticing in its deceptive appearance of coolness , so repellent with its unrelieved gloom , where lay , entombed and rotting , countless generations of trees , and where their successors stood as if mourning , in dark green foliage , immense and helpless , awaiting their turn . Only the parasites seemed to live there in a sinuous rush upwards into the air and sunshine , feeding on the dead and the dying alike , and crowning their victims with pink and blue flowers that gleamed amongst the boughs , incongruous and cruel , like a strident and mocking note in the solemn harmony of the doomed trees . A man could hide there , thought Dain , as he approached a place where the creepers had been torn and hacked into an archway that might have been the beginning of a path . As he bent down to look through he heard angry grunting , and a sounder of wild pig crashed away in the undergrowth . An acrid smell of damp earth and of decaying leaves took him by the throat , and he drew back with a scared face , as if he had been touched by the breath of Death itself . The very air seemed dead in there - heavy and stagnating , poisoned with the corruption of countless ages . He went on , staggering on his way , urged by the nervous restlessness that made him feel tired yet caused him to loathe the very idea of immobility and repose . Was he a wild man to hide in the woods and perhaps be killed there - in the darkness - where there was no room to breathe ? He would wait for his enemies in the sunlight , where he could see the sky and feel the breeze . He knew how a Malay chief should die . The sombre and desperate fury , that peculiar inheritance of his race , took possession of him , and he glared savagely across the clearing towards the gap in the bushes by the riverside . They would come from there . In imagination he saw them now . He saw the bearded faces and the white jackets of the officers , the light on the levelled barrels of the rifles . What is the bravery of the greatest warrior before the firearms in the hand of a slave ? He would walk toward them with a smiling face , with his hands held out in a sign of submission till he was very near them . He would speak friendly words - come nearer yet - yet nearer - so near that they could touch him with their hands and stretch them out to make him a captive . That would be the time : with a shout and a leap he would be in the midst of them , kriss in hand , killing , killing , killing , and would die with the shouts of his enemies in his ears , their warm blood spurting before his eyes . Carried away by his excitement , he snatched the kriss hidden in his sarong , and , drawing a long breath , rushed forward , struck at the empty air , and fell on his face . He lay as if stunned in the sudden reaction from his exaltation , thinking that , even if he died thus gloriously , it would have to be before he saw Nina . Better so . If he saw her again he felt that death would be too terrible . With horror he , the descendant of Rajahs and of conquerors , had to face the doubt of his own bravery . His desire of life tormented him in a paroxysm of agonising remorse . He had not the courage to stir a limb . He had lost faith in himself , and there was nothing else in him of what makes a man . The suffering remained , for it is ordered that it should abide in the human body even to the last breath , and fear remained . Dimly he could look into the depths of his passionate love , see its strength and its weakness , and felt afraid . The sun went down slowly . The shadow of the western forest marched over the clearing , covered the man 's scorched shoulders with its cool mantle , and went on hurriedly to mingle with the shadows of other forests on the eastern side . The sun lingered for a while amongst the light tracery of the higher branches , as if in friendly reluctance to abandon the body stretched in the green paddy - field . Then Dain , revived by the cool of the evening breeze , sat up and stared round him . As he did so the sun dipped sharply , as if ashamed of being detected in a sympathising attitude , and the clearing , which during the day was all light , became suddenly all darkness , where the fire gleamed like an eye . Dain walked slowly towards the creek , and , divesting himself of his torn sarong , his only garment , entered the water cautiously . He had had nothing to eat that day , and had not dared show himself in daylight by the water - side to drink . Now , as he swam silently , he swallowed a few mouthfuls of water that lapped about his lips . This did him good , and he walked with greater confidence in himself and others as he returned towards the fire . Had he been betrayed by Lakamba all would have been over by this . He made up a big blaze , and while it lasted dried himself , and then lay down by the embers . He could not sleep , but he felt a great numbness in all his limbs . His restlessness was gone , and he was content to lay still , measuring the time by watching the stars that rose in endless succession above the forests , while the slight puffs of wind under the cloudless sky seemed to fan their twinkle into a greater brightness . Dreamily he assured himself over and over again that she would come , till the certitude crept into his heart and filled him with a great peace . Yes , when the next day broke , they would be together on the great blue sea that was like life - away from the forests that were like death . He murmured the name of Nina into the silent space with a tender smile : this seemed to break the spell of stillness , and far away by the creek a frog croaked loudly as if in answer . A chorus of loud roars and plaintive calls rose from the mud along the line of bushes . He laughed heartily ; doubtless it was their love - song . He felt affectionate towards the frogs and listened , pleased with the noisy life near him . When the moon peeped above the trees he felt the old impatience and the old restlessness steal over him . Why was she so late ? True , it was a long way to come with a single paddle . With what skill and what endurance could those small hands manage a heavy paddle ! It was very wonderful - such small hands , such soft little palms that knew how to touch his cheek with a feel lighter than the fanning of a butterfly 's wing . Wonderful ! He lost himself lovingly in the contemplation of this tremendous mystery , and when he looked at the moon again it had risen a hand 's breadth above the trees . Would she come ? He forced himself to lay still , overcoming the impulse to rise and rush round the clearing again . He turned this way and that ; at last , quivering with the effort , he lay on his back , and saw her face among the stars looking down on him . The croaking of frogs suddenly ceased . With the watchfulness of a hunted man Dain sat up , listening anxiously , and heard several splashes in the water as the frogs took rapid headers into the creek . He knew that they had been alarmed by something , and stood up suspicious and attentive . A slight grating noise , then the dry sound as of two pieces of wood struck against each other . Somebody was about to land ! He took up an armful of brushwood , and , without taking his eyes from the path , held it over the embers of his fire . He waited , undecided , and saw something gleam amongst the bushes ; then a white figure came out of the shadows and seemed to float towards him in the pale light . His heart gave a great leap and stood still , then went on shaking his frame in furious beats . He dropped the brushwood upon the glowing coals , and had an impression of shouting her name - of rushing to meet her ; yet he emitted no sound , he stirred not an inch , but he stood silent and motionless like chiselled bronze under the moonlight that streamed over his naked shoulders . As he stood still , fighting with his breath , as if bereft of his senses by the intensity of his delight , she walked up to him with quick , resolute steps , and , with the appearance of one about to leap from a dangerous height , threw both her arms round his neck with a sudden gesture . A small blue gleam crept amongst the dry branches , and the crackling of reviving fire was the only sound as they faced each other in the speechless emotion of that meeting ; then the dry fuel caught at once , and a bright hot flame shot upwards in a blaze as high as their heads , and in its light they saw each other 's eyes . Neither of them spoke . He was regaining his senses in a slight tremor that ran upwards along his rigid body and hung about his trembling lips . She drew back her head and fastened her eyes on his in one of those long looks that are a woman 's most terrible weapon ; a look that is more stirring than the closest touch , and more dangerous than the thrust of a dagger , because it also whips the soul out of the body , but leaves the body alive and helpless , to be swayed here and there by the capricious tempests of passion and desire ; a look that enwraps the whole body , and that penetrates into the innermost recesses of the being , bringing terrible defeat in the delirious uplifting of accomplished conquest . It has the same meaning for the man of the forests and the sea as for the man threading the paths of the more dangerous wilderness of houses and streets . Men that had felt in their breasts the awful exultation such a look awakens become mere things of to - day - which is paradise ; forget yesterday - which was suffering ; care not for to - morrow - which may be perdition . They wish to live under that look for ever . It is the look of woman 's surrender . He understood , and , as if suddenly released from his invisible bonds , fell at her feet with a shout of joy , and , embracing her knees , hid his head in the folds of her dress , murmuring disjointed words of gratitude and love . Never before had he felt so proud as now , when at the feet of that woman that half belonged to his enemies . Her fingers played with his hair in an absent - minded caress as she stood absorbed in thought . The thing was done . Her mother was right . The man was her slave . As she glanced down at his kneeling form she felt a great pitying tenderness for that man she was used to call - even in her thoughts - the master of life . She lifted her eyes and looked sadly at the southern heavens under which lay the path of their lives - her own , and that man 's at her feet . Did he not say himself is that she was the light of his life ? She would be his light and his wisdom ; she would be his greatness and his strength ; yet hidden from the eyes of all men she would be , above all , his only and lasting weakness . A very woman ! In the sublime vanity of her kind she was thinking already of moulding a god from the clay at her feet . A god for others to worship . She was content to see him as he was now , and to feel him quiver at the slightest touch of her light fingers . And while her eyes looked sadly at the southern stars a faint smile seemed to be playing about her firm lips . Who can tell in the fitful light of a camp fire ? It might have been a smile of triumph , or of conscious power , or of tender pity , or , perhaps , of love . She spoke softly to him , and he rose to his feet , putting his arm round her in quiet consciousness of his ownership ; she laid her head on his shoulder with a sense of defiance to all the world in the encircling protection of that arm . He was hers with all his qualities and all his faults . His strength and his courage , his recklessness and his daring , his simple wisdom and his savage cunning - all were hers . As they passed together out of the red light of the fire into the silver shower of rays that fell upon the clearing he bent his head over her face , and she saw in his eyes the dreamy intoxication of boundless felicity from the close touch of her slight figure clasped to his side . With a rhythmical swing of their bodies they walked through the light towards the outlying shadows of the forests that seemed to guard their happiness in solemn immobility . Their forms melted in the play of light and shadow at the foot of the big trees , but the murmur of tender words lingered over the empty clearing , grew faint , and died out . A sigh as of immense sorrow passed over the land in the last effort of the dying breeze , and in the deep silence which succeeded , the earth and the heavens were suddenly hushed up in the mournful contemplation of human love and human blindness . They walked slowly back to the fire . He made for her a seat out of the dry branches , and , throwing himself down at her feet , lay his head in her lap and gave himself up to the dreamy delight of the passing hour . Their voices rose and fell , tender or animated as they spoke of their love and of their future . She , with a few skilful words spoken from time to time , guided his thoughts , and he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk passionate and tender , grave or menacing , according to the mood which she evoked . He spoke to her of his own island , where the gloomy forests and the muddy rivers were unknown . He spoke of its terraced fields , of the murmuring clear rills of sparkling water that flowed down the sides of great mountains , bringing life to the land and joy to its tillers . And he spoke also of the mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of trees knew the secrets of the passing clouds , and was the dwelling - place of the mysterious spirit of his race , of the guardian genius of his house . He spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that whistled high above the summits of burning mountains . He spoke of his forefathers that conquered ages ago the island of which he was to be the future ruler . And then as , in her interest , she brought her face nearer to his , he , touching lightly the thick tresses of her long hair , felt a sudden impulse to speak to her of the sea he loved so well ; and he told her of its never - ceasing voice , to which he had listened as a child , wondering at its hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet ; of its enchanting glitter ; of its senseless and capricious fury ; how its surface was for ever changing , and yet always enticing , while its depths were for ever the same , cold and cruel , and full of the wisdom of destroyed life . He told her how it held men slaves of its charm for a lifetime , and then , regardless of their devotion , swallowed them up , angry at their fear of its mystery , which it would never disclose , not even to those that loved it most . While he talked , Nina 's head had been gradually sinking lower , and her face almost touched his now . Her hair was over his eyes , her breath was on his forehead , her arms were about his body . No two beings could be closer to each other , yet she guessed rather than understood the meaning of his last words that came out after a slight hesitation in a faint murmur , dying out imperceptibly into a profound and significant silence : "
61634	61651	61629	61630	a woman	613	" She closed his lips with a sudden kiss , and answered in a steady voice - "
61673	61756	61629	61630	a woman	613	" Over their heads a film of dark , thread - like clouds , looking like immense cobwebs drifting under the stars , darkened the sky with the presage of the coming thunderstorm . From the invisible hills the first distant rumble of thunder came in a prolonged roll which , after tossing about from hill to hill , lost itself in the forests of the Pantai . Dain and Nina stood up , and the former looked at the sky uneasily . "
61766	61770	61761	61761	Babalatchi	103	" he said . "
61794	61795	61796	61796	He	103	" "
61809	61813	61796	61796	He	103	" said Nina . "
61822	61826	61814	61814	I	0	" she added . "
61833	61834	61828	61828	you	2229	" "
61837	61850	61828	61828	you	2229	" answered Dain shortly , with a careless glance towards the creek . "
61856	61860	61828	61828	you	2229	" he continued , "
61910	61911	61912	61912	Dain	74	" "
61914	61920	61912	61912	Dain	74	" interposed Nina , earnestly , "
61937	61938	61926	61926	I	0	" "
61941	61949	61926	61926	I	0	" said Dain , after listening awhile . "
61996	62002	61986	61986	you	0	" he went on quickly . "
62035	62194	62195	62195	Father	2606	" He laid his hand on his kriss , and awaited the approach of his unexpected visitor . The fire was burning very low , and small clouds - precursors of the storm - crossed the face of the moon in rapid succession , and their flying shadows darkened the clearing . He could not make out who the man might be , but he felt uneasy at the steady advance of the tall figure walking on the path with a heavy tread , and hailed it with a command to stop . The man stopped at some little distance , and Dain expected him to speak , but all he could hear was his deep breathing . Through a break in the flying clouds a sudden and fleeting brightness descended upon the clearing . Before the darkness closed in again , Dain saw a hand holding some glittering object extended towards him , heard Nina 's cry of "
62197	62276	62195	62195	Father	2606	" and in an instant the girl was between him and Almayer 's revolver . Nina 's loud cry woke up the echoes of the sleeping woods , and the three stood still as if waiting for the return of silence before they would give expression to their various feelings . At the appearance of Nina , Almayer 's arm fell by his side , and he made a step forward . Dain pushed the girl gently aside . "
62298	62307	62295	62296	Tuan Almayer	84	" said Dain , breaking the strained silence . "
62315	62324	62295	62296	Tuan Almayer	84	" he went on , speaking to Nina , "
62348	62444	62445	62445	Dain	74	" Almayer ground his teeth and raised his arm again . With a quick bound Dain was at his side : there was a short scuffle , during which one chamber of the revolver went off harmlessly , then the weapon , wrenched out of Almayer 's hand , whirled through the air and fell in the bushes . The two men stood close together , breathing hard . The replenished fire threw out an unsteady circle of light and shone on the terrified face of Nina , who looked at them with outstretched hands . "
62447	62453	62454	62454	Dain	74	" she cried out warningly , "
62456	62479	62454	62454	Dain	74	" He waved his hand towards her in a reassuring gesture , and , turning to Almayer , said with great courtesy - "
62509	62516	62517	62517	Your	84	" he continued , indicating Nina . "
62529	62530	62531	62531	Nina	73	" "
62533	62537	62531	62531	Nina	73	" exclaimed Almayer , "
62570	62650	62658	62659	his people	2245	" He opened his arms with the certitude of clasping her to his breast in another second . She did not move . As it dawned upon him that she did not mean to obey he felt a deadly cold creep into his heart , and , pressing the palms of his hands to his temples , he looked down on the ground in mute despair . Dain took Nina by the arm and led her towards her father . "
62661	62665	62658	62659	his people	2245	" he said . "
62712	62784	62786	62786	you	2248	" He released her , and , stepping back a few paces out of the circle of light , stood in the darkness looking at them with calm interest . The reflection of a distant flash of lightning lit up the clouds over their heads , and was followed after a short interval by the faint rumble of thunder , which mingled with Almayer 's voice as he began to speak . "
62845	62862	62863	62863	You	826	" She raised her hand to stop him , and turning her head slightly , asked - "
62872	62873	62865	62866	this Dain	2638	" "
62879	62888	62875	62877	all the gods	2254	" came the impassioned answer from the darkness - "
62949	62950	62940	62940	I	0	" "
62954	62976	62940	62940	I	0	" shouted the exasperated Almayer . A deep silence succeeded this outburst , then the voice of Dain was heard again . "
62981	62989	62940	62940	I	0	" he said in a gentle tone , "
63045	63093	63107	63107	they	2260	" Almayer groaned in his extremity of rage and shame . Nina laid her hand lightly on his shoulder , and the contact , light as the touch of a falling leaf , seemed to calm him . He spoke quickly , and in English this time . "
63097	63101	63107	63107	they	2260	" he said - "
63216	63217	63207	63207	you	826	" "
63220	63224	63207	63207	you	826	" she interrupted , "
63288	63315	63280	63280	I	0	" He staggered as if struck in the face , but with a quick , unhesitating grasp she caught him by the arm and steadied him . "
63321	63343	63344	63344	You	826	" he repeated slowly , in a dazed manner , and stopped short , astounded at the completeness of his misfortune . "
63349	63355	63344	63344	You	826	" she went on again , "
63476	63477	63478	63478	Nina	73	" "
63480	63484	63468	63468	you	826	" cried Almayer , "
63492	63508	63468	63468	you	826	" She looked down directly , but continued speaking only a little above a whisper . "
63512	63517	63468	63468	you	826	" she went on , "
63616	63637	63611	63611	I	0	" She paused . Almayer sighed deeply . With her eyes still fixed on the ground she began speaking again . "
63752	63753	63755	63755	he	826	" "
63762	63768	63769	63769	he	826	" answered Almayer , scornfully , "
63866	63896	63852	63852	they	728	" He made a step towards his daughter and laid hold of her by the shoulder , his other hand pointing down the path to the landing - place . "
63899	63903	63852	63852	they	728	" exclaimed Dain ; "
63910	63924	63852	63852	they	728	" Nina wrenched herself free and looked straight at Almayer 's angry face . "
63932	63939	63852	63852	they	728	" she said with desperate energy . "
63948	63949	63950	63950	You	0	" "
63953	63959	63950	63950	You	0	" said Almayer , contemptuously . "
64001	64013	64015	64015	I	0	" He waited for a while , and then added meaningly - "
64021	64022	64015	64015	I	0	" "
64026	64032	64033	64033	you	0	" she answered in Malay , "
64079	64094	64077	64077	Dain	74	" she said , turning towards the motionless but attentive figure in the darkness , "
64116	64140	64141	64141	I	0	" Dain came into the circle of light , and , throwing his arm around Nina 's neck , whispered in her ear - "
64174	64203	64167	64167	Babalatchi	103	" He straightened himself up , taking his arm off her shoulder , and confronted Almayer , who looked at them both with an expression of concentrated fury . "
64206	64217	64167	64167	Babalatchi	103	" she cried , clinging to Dain in wild alarm . "
64265	64276	64285	64285	I	0	" She fell at his feet sobbing violently and repeating , "
64283	64284	64285	64285	I	0	" "
64290	64303	64304	64304	You	0	" said Almayer , speaking also in Malay , with sombre calmness . "
64315	64347	64348	64348	Hai	141	" Dain shook Nina off , and , making a sudden lunge , struck Almayer full in the chest with the handle of his kriss , keeping the point towards himself . "
64365	64373	64356	64356	me	0	" he said in his even voice . "
64379	64385	64376	64377	Tuan Putih	116	" he added with dignity . "
64415	64564	64410	64410	she	2300	" There was not a glimmer of light in the sky now , and the tops of the trees were as invisible as their trunks , being lost in the mass of clouds that hung low over the woods , the clearing , and the river . Every outline had disappeared in the intense blackness that seemed to have destroyed everything but space . Only the fire glimmered like a star forgotten in this annihilation of all visible things , and nothing was heard after Dain ceased speaking but the sobs of Nina , whom he held in his arms , kneeling beside the fire . Almayer stood looking down at them in gloomy thoughtfulness . As he was opening his lips to speak they were startled by a cry of warning by the riverside , followed by the splash of many paddles and the sound of voices . "
64567	64582	64583	64583	Ada	127	" shouted Dain , lifting up Nina as he got upon his feet quickly . "
64587	64605	64585	64585	Ada	127	" came the answer from the panting statesman who ran up the path and stood amongst them . "
64611	64625	64585	64585	Ada	127	" he said to Dain excitedly , without taking any notice of Almayer . "
64639	64640	64632	64633	That woman	1815	" "
64644	64666	64641	64642	What woman	2306	" asked Dain , looking at Nina . Just then there was only one woman in the whole world for him . "
64724	64725	64728	64728	you	2311	" "
64732	64736	64728	64728	you	2311	" asked Almayer . "
64796	64797	64785	64794	the messengers sent out to the white men 's house	2315	" "
64809	64824	64785	64794	the messengers sent out to the white men 's house	2315	" said Almayer , addressing Dain , while Babalatchi stamped with impatience , muttering , "
64831	64832	64848	64849	no man	2820	" "
64835	64841	64848	64849	no man	2820	" answered Dain , steadily , "
64856	64857	64851	64851	I	0	" "
64865	64883	64863	64863	yourself	2311	" sobbed out Nina . He clasped her close , looking at her tenderly , and whispered , "
64892	64893	64890	64890	Nina	73	" "
64902	64909	64894	64894	I	0	" broke in Babalatchi , angrily . "
64934	65033	64931	64931	I	0	" He picked up his staff , and , turning to go , looked at Dain as if offering him his last chance of escape . But Dain 's face was hidden amongst Nina 's black tresses , and he did not see this last appealing glance . Babalatchi vanished in the darkness . Shortly after his disappearance they heard the war canoe leave the landing - place in the swish of the numerous paddles dipped in the water together . Almost at the same time Ali came up from the riverside , two paddles on his shoulder . "
65045	65049	65042	65043	Tuan Almayer	84	" he said , "
65082	65083	65075	65077	the white men	2919	" "
65089	65093	65075	65077	the white men	2919	" said Almayer , "
65100	65116	65117	65117	Nina	73	" He remained silent , listening to Ali 's footsteps , then turned to Nina . "
65119	65124	65117	65117	Nina	73	" he said sadly , "
65133	65216	65126	65126	you	73	" There was no answer . She did not even turn her head , which was pressed close to Dain 's breast . He made a movement as if to leave them and stopped . By the dim glow of the burning - out fire he saw their two motionless figures . The woman 's back turned to him with the long black hair streaming down over the white dress , and Dain 's calm face looking at him above her head . "
65221	65244	65126	65126	you	73	" he muttered to himself . After a long pause he spoke again a little lower , but in an unsteady voice , "
65259	65271	65255	65257	a white man	242	" He broke down completely there , and went on tearfully , "
65287	65294	65283	65285	Very good family	2336	" he repeated , weeping bitterly . "
65341	65366	65367	65367	I	0	" he cried aloud , with a ring of despair in his voice . He recovered his composure after a while and said distinctly - "
65462	65603	65460	65460	me	0	" He led the way , following the bank as far as the forest . Ali answered to his call , and , pushing their way through the dense bush , they stepped into the canoe hidden under the overhanging branches . Dain laid Nina in the bottom , and sat holding her head on his knees . Almayer and Ali each took up a paddle . As they were going to push out Ali hissed warningly . All listened . In the great stillness before the bursting out of the thunderstorm they could hear the sound of oars working regularly in their row - locks . The sound approached steadily , and Dain , looking through the branches , could see the faint shape of a big white boat . A woman 's voice said in a cautious tone - "
65621	65645	65609	65609	you	2352	" The boat was passing them so close in the narrow creek that the blades of the long oars nearly touched the canoe . "
65662	65681	65656	65656	He	2355	" was the quiet order in a man 's voice , and in Dutch . Somebody else whispered : "
65696	65711	65656	65656	He	2355	" And then the boat floated past them , disappearing instantly in the darkness . "
65714	65720	65656	65656	He	2355	" whispered Ali , eagerly , "
65729	65759	65656	65656	He	2355	" The little canoe swung into the stream , and as it sprung forward in response to the vigorous dig of the paddles they could hear an angry shout . "
65777	65804	65808	65811	O senseless white men	2358	" Blue lights blazed out in different parts of the clearing , and the shrill voice of a woman cried in accents of rage and pain - "
65817	65821	65813	65813	He	2355	" CHAPTER XII . "
65827	65849	65813	65813	He	2355	" said Dain , indicating with the blade of his paddle a small islet about a mile ahead of the canoe - "
65881	66683	65873	65873	We	2362	" Almayer , who was steering , nodded without speaking , and by a slight sweep of his paddle laid the head of the canoe in the required direction . They were just leaving the southern outlet of the Pantai , which lay behind them in a straight and long vista of water shining between two walls of thick verdure that ran downwards and towards each other , till at last they joined and sank together in the far - away distance . The sun , rising above the calm waters of the Straits , marked its own path by a streak of light that glided upon the sea and darted up the wide reach of the river , a hurried messenger of light and life to the gloomy forests of the coast ; and in this radiance of the sun 's pathway floated the black canoe heading for the islet which lay bathed in sunshine , the yellow sands of its encircling beach shining like an inlaid golden disc on the polished steel of the unwrinkled sea . To the north and south of it rose other islets , joyous in their brilliant colouring of green and yellow , and on the main coast the sombre line of mangrove bushes ended to the southward in the reddish cliffs of Tanjong Mirrah , advancing into the sea , steep and shadowless under the clear , light of the early morning . The bottom of the canoe grated upon the sand as the little craft ran upon the beach . Ali leaped on shore and held on while Dain stepped out carrying Nina in his arms , exhausted by the events and the long travelling during the night . Almayer was the last to leave the boat , and together with Ali ran it higher up on the beach . Then Ali , tired out by the long paddling , laid down in the shade of the canoe , and incontinently fell asleep . Almayer sat sideways on the gunwale , and with his arms crossed on his breast , looked to the southward upon the sea . After carefully laying Nina down in the shade of the bushes growing in the middle of the islet , Dain threw himself beside her and watched in silent concern the tears that ran down from under her closed eyelids , and lost themselves in that fine sand upon which they both were lying face to face . These tears and this sorrow were for him a profound and disquieting mystery . Now , when the danger was past , why should she grieve ? He doubted her love no more than he would have doubted the fact of his own existence , but as he lay looking ardently in her face , watching her tears , her parted lips , her very breath , he was uneasily conscious of something in her he could not understand . Doubtless she had the wisdom of perfect beings . He sighed . He felt something invisible that stood between them , something that would let him approach her so far , but no farther . No desire , no longing , no effort of will or length of life could destroy this vague feeling of their difference . With awe but also with great pride he concluded that it was her own incomparable perfection . She was his , and yet she was like a woman from another world . His ! His ! He exulted in the glorious thought ; nevertheless her tears pained him . With a wisp of her own hair which he took in his hand with timid reverence he tried in an access of clumsy tenderness to dry the tears that trembled on her eyelashes . He had his reward in a fleeting smile that brightened her face for the short fraction of a second , but soon the tears fell faster than ever , and he could bear it no more . He rose and walked towards Almayer , who still sat absorbed in his contemplation of the sea . It was a very , very long time since he had seen the sea - that sea that leads everywhere , brings everything , and takes away so much . He had almost forgotten why he was there , and dreamily he could see all his past life on the smooth and boundless surface that glittered before his eyes . Dain 's hand laid on Almayer 's shoulder recalled him with a start from some country very far away indeed . He turned round , but his eyes seemed to look rather at the place where Dain stood than at the man himself . Dain felt uneasy under the unconscious gaze . "
66686	66690	66691	66691	She	2365	" said Almayer . "
66695	66701	66702	66702	She	2365	" murmured Dain , softly . "
66708	66714	66715	66715	I	0	" asked Almayer , indifferently . "
66746	66759	66742	66742	You	2366	" Almayer shrugged his shoulders and turned away again towards the sea . "
66765	66769	66762	66763	Tuan Putih	116	" urged Dain . "
66787	66788	66762	66763	Tuan Putih	116	" "
66810	66844	66845	66845	He	0	" answered Almayer , speaking without the faintest spark of expression in his face , ' so it behoves you to go to her quick , for fear you may find her dead . "
66886	66896	66897	66897	he	0	" And you go when the sun is overhead ? "
66900	66909	66897	66897	he	0	" Yes , Tuan . Then we go , "
66913	66921	66923	66923	Almayer	72	" I have not long to wait , "
66925	66944	66945	66945	he	0	" It is most important for me to see you go . Both of you . Most important , "
67001	67004	67005	67005	Almayer	72	" Dain . "
67051	67056	67057	67057	she	162	" Oh , father ! "
67075	67084	67086	67086	Almayer	72	" I shall never forgive you , Nina , "
67093	67165	67166	67166	He	2373	" You have torn my heart from me while I dreamt of your happiness . You have deceived me . Your eyes that for me were like truth itself lied to me in every glance - for how long ? You know that best . When you were caressing my cheek you were counting the minutes to the sunset that was the signal for your meeting with that man - there ! "
67380	67387	67389	67389	Nina	73	" What is there to forgive ? "
67404	67438	67402	67402	herself	73	" Can I not live my own life as you have lived yours ? The path you would have wished me to follow has been closed to me by no fault of mine . "
67439	67445	67447	67447	Almayer	72	" You never told me , "
67449	67455	67456	67456	she	73	" You never asked me , "
67459	67507	67456	67456	she	73	" and I thought you were like the others and did not care . I bore the memory of my humiliation alone , and why should I tell you that it came to me because I am your daughter ? I knew you could not avenge me . "
67508	67518	67520	67520	Almayer	72	" And yet I was thinking of that only , "
67522	67547	67520	67520	Almayer	72	" and I wanted to give you years of happiness for the short day of your suffering . I only knew of one way . "
67548	67558	67559	67559	she	72	" Ah ! but it was not my way ! "
67562	67573	67574	67574	she	72	" Could you give me happiness without life ? Life ! "
67588	67596	67597	67597	she	72	" Life that means power and love , "
67604	67607	67609	67609	Almayer	72	" That ! "
67627	67632	67633	67633	she	72	" Yes , that ! "
67662	67674	67676	67676	Almayer	72	" I would have rather strangled you with my own hands , "
67727	67742	67743	67743	she	72	" You say that because you do not understand the meaning of my words , "
67747	67879	67743	67743	she	72	" Between you and my mother there never was any love . When I returned to Sambir I found the place which I thought would be a peaceful refuge for my heart , filled with weariness and hatred - and mutual contempt . I have listened to your voice and to her voice . Then I saw that you could not understand me ; for was I not part of that woman ? Of her who was the regret and shame of your life ? I had to choose - I hesitated . Why were you so blind ? Did you not see me struggling before your eyes ? But , when he came , all doubt disappeared , and I saw only the light of the blue and cloudless heaven - "
67880	67888	67890	67890	Almayer	72	" I will tell you the rest , "
67892	67952	67953	67953	he	2385	" when that man came I also saw the blue and the sunshine of the sky . A thunderbolt has fallen from that sky , and suddenly all is still and dark around me for ever . I will never forgive you , Nina ; and to - morrow I shall forget you ! I shall never forgive you , "
68357	68366	68367	68367	he	2385	" I will never forgive you , Nina ! "
68530	68539	68527	68527	she	2386	" You speak so because you love me . "
68545	68551	68552	68552	she	2386	" Yes , you do , "
68564	68572	68561	68561	she	2386	" and you will never forget me . "
68587	68595	68597	68597	Dain	74	" Here is the boat coming now , "
68652	68656	68658	68658	Dain	74	" What news ? "
68660	68694	68658	68658	Dain	74	" We have had orders secretly and in the night to take off from this islet a man and a woman . I see the woman . Which of you is the man ? "
68695	68703	68705	68705	Dain	74	" Come , delight of my eyes , "
68709	68740	68705	68705	Dain	74	" Now we go , and your voice shall be for my ears only . You have spoken your last words to the Tuan Putih , your father . Come . "
68790	68793	68794	68794	she	73	" Goodbye , "
68810	68819	68821	68821	Almayer	72	" If you have any pity for me , "
68832	68838	68821	68821	Almayer	72	" take that woman away . "
69104	69107	69109	69109	Ali	95	" Dapat ! "
69113	69145	69109	69109	Ali	95	" Got him , master ! Got prau ! Not there ! Look more Tanah Mirrah side . Aha ! That way ! Master , see ? Now plain . See ? "
69371	69374	69375	69375	he	95	" Master , "
69379	69397	69375	69375	he	95	" time to get house now . Long way off to pull . All ready , sir . "
69398	69401	69403	69403	Almayer	72	" Wait , "
70564	70567	70569	70569	Almayer	72	" Forget ! "
70689	70692	70693	70693	he	2449	" Eternity ! "
71248	71254	71255	71255	he	95	" Master ! House burn ! "
71287	71294	71296	71296	Almayer	72	" Stop this noise , fool ! "
71300	71319	71296	71296	Almayer	72	" Pick up my hammock and blankets and take them to the other house . Quick , now ! "
71350	71356	71360	71360	himself	72	" It has caught well , "
71362	71368	71369	71369	he	95	" Be quiet , Jack , "
71579	71584	71558	71567	the Tuan Putih , with bowed head and dragging feet	2501	" Almayer 's Folly . "
72153	72158	72111	72111	he	95	" Almayer 's Folly . "
72253	72261	72229	72229	Co.	148	" the only geese on the east coast "
72589	72592	72593	72593	he	99	" Ford , "
72599	72605	72593	72593	he	99	" I can not forget . "
72606	72611	72613	72613	Ford	99	" Ca n't you ? "
72623	72649	72650	72650	He	99	" I wish I was like you . I am losing my memory - age , I suppose ; only the other day my mate - "
72670	72685	72687	72687	Ford	99	" Hallo ! You are better to - day . Soon be all right , "
72743	72748	72749	72749	he	99	" Let her go ! "
72756	72792	72749	72749	he	99	" Let her go . To - morrow I shall forget . I am a firm man , . . . firm as a . . . rock , . . . firm . . . "
72875	72881	72883	72883	Ali	150	" And they both smoke , "
72885	72893	72894	72894	Ali	150	" Phew ! Opium , you mean ? "
72908	72918	72903	72903	he	99	" Poor devil ! The sooner the better now . "
72929	72936	72937	72937	he	99	" What are you doing here ? "
73026	73047	73048	73048	he	99	" There is plenty of room . He smokes , and I live here . He will not smoke long , "
73051	73057	73059	73059	Ford	99	" Where is he now ? "
73061	73067	73069	73071	Jim - Eng	118	" Inside . He sleeps , "
73180	73185	73186	73186	he	99	" What 's that ? "
73189	73192	73194	73196	Jim - Eng	118	" That , "
73203	73223	73199	73199	his	118	" that is the name of the house . All the same like my house . Very good name . "
73276	73282	73262	73263	patient Chinaman	2568	" House of heavenly delight . "
73342	73351	73353	73353	Babalatchi	103	" We had news from Bali last moon , "
73355	73371	73372	73372	Ford	99	" A grandson is born to the old Rajah , and there is great rejoicing . "
73377	73380	73383	73383	Babalatchi	103	" Yes , "
73392	73405	73383	73383	Babalatchi	103	" I told him . That was before he began to smoke . "
73406	73412	73414	73414	Ford	99	" Well , and what ? "
73416	73423	73425	73425	Babalatchi	103	" I escaped with my life , "
73431	73447	73454	73454	he	103	" because the white man is very weak and fell as he rushed upon me . "
73457	73464	73454	73454	he	103	" She is mad with joy . "
73465	73472	73454	73454	he	103	" Mrs. Almayer , you mean ? "
73473	73497	73499	73499	Babalatchi	103	" Yes , she lives in our Rajah 's house . She will not die soon . Such women live a long time , "
73511	73558	73508	73508	his	103	" She has dollars , and she has buried them , but we know where . We had much trouble with those people . We had to pay a fine and listen to threats from the white men , and now we have to be careful . "
73573	73604	73605	73605	he	103	" There will be fighting . There is a breath of war on the islands . Shall I live long enough to see ? . . . Ah , Tuan ! "
73612	73668	73605	73605	he	103	" the old times were best . Even I have sailed with Lanun men , and boarded in the night silent ships with white sails . That was before an English Rajah ruled in Kuching . Then we fought amongst ourselves and were happy . Now when we fight with you we can only die ! "

73712	73821	73822	73822	He	2574	" She grew thin and could not work . Then Bulangi , who is a thief and a pig - eater , gave her to me for fifty dollars . I sent her amongst my women to grow fat . I wanted to hear the sound of her laughter , but she must have been bewitched , and . . . she died two days ago . Nay , Tuan . Why do you speak bad words ? I am old - that is true - but why should I not like the sight of a young face and the sound of a young voice in my house ? "
73834	73858	73822	73822	He	2574	" I am like a white man talking too much of what is not men 's talk when they speak to one another . "
