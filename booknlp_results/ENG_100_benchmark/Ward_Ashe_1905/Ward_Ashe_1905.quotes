25	45	23	23	I	0	" Just oblige me and touch With your scourge that minx Chloe , but do n't hurt her much . "
52	59	65	65	she	222	" He ought to be here , "
121	136	72	73	Mary Lyster	223	" Yes , indeed . You made out there was a train about twelve . "
137	172	207	208	Mary Lyster	223	" Certainly . They ca n't have taken more than an hour to speechify after the declaration of the poll . And I know William meant to catch that train if he possibly could . "
173	181	72	73	Mary Lyster	223	" And take his seat this evening ? "
459	475	476	476	she	222	" Well , I wonder what William will do , this time , in Parliament ! "
500	509	511	512	Miss Lyster	225	" He is sure to do extremely well , "
520	548	517	517	her	222	" My dear -- do you know that William has been for eight years -- since he left Trinity -- one of the idlest young men alive ? "
549	555	480	480	she	222	" He had one brief ! "
556	573	575	576	Lady Tranmore	222	" Yes -- somewhere in the country , where all the juniors get one in turn , "
578	626	575	576	Lady Tranmore	222	" That was the year he was so keen and went on circuit , and never missed a sessions . Next year nothing would induce him to stir out of town . What has he done with himself all these eight years ? I ca n't imagine . "
627	635	637	638	Mary Lyster	223	" He has grown -- uncommonly handsome , "
651	659	661	662	Lady Tranmore	222	" I never remember him anything else , "
664	697	661	662	Lady Tranmore	222	" All the artists who came here and to Narroways wanted to paint him . I used to think it would make him a spoiled little ape . But nothing spoiled him . "
702	731	698	699	Miss Lyster	225	" You know , Cousin Elizabeth -- and you may as well confess it at once!--that you think him the ablest , handsomest , and charmingest of men ! "
732	738	740	741	Lady Tranmore	222	" Of course I do , "
745	792	740	741	Lady Tranmore	222	" I am certain , moreover -- now -- that he will be Prime Minister . And as for idleness , that , of course , is only a _ façon de parler _ . He has worked hard enough at the things which please him . "
793	799	801	802	Mary Lyster	223	" There -- you see ! "
806	812	814	816	the elder lady	621	" Not politics , anyway , "
820	890	814	816	the elder lady	621	" He went into the House to please me , because I was a fool and wanted to see him there . But I must say when his constituents turned him out last year I thought they would have been a mean - spirited set if they had n't . They knew very well he 'd never done a stroke for them . Attendances -- divisions -- perfectly scandalous ! "
891	911	987	987	she	623	" Well , here he is , in triumphantly for somewhere else -- with all sorts of delightful prospects ! "
924	961	916	916	Her	222	" That , of course , is because -- now -- he 's a personage . Everything'll be made easy for him now . My dear Mary , they talk of England 's being a democracy ! "
993	1014	987	987	she	623	" Well -- work or no work -- the first thing we 've got to do is to marry him . "
1047	1055	1057	1058	Lady Tranmore	222	" Do n't you agree , Polly ? "
1088	1094	1096	1097	Miss Lyster	225	" Why , of course , "
1121	1134	1106	1106	she	225	" But that surely will be made easy for him , too . "
1135	1168	1170	1171	Lady Tranmore	222	" Well , after all , the girls ca n't propose ! And I never saw him take any interest in a girl yet -- outside his own family , of course , "
1175	1188	1190	1191	Miss Lyster	225	" No -- he does certainly devote himself to the married women , "
1212	1264	1170	1171	Lady Tranmore	222	" He would sooner have an hour with Madame d'Estrées than a week with the prettiest miss in London . That 's quite true , but I vow it 's the girls ' own fault ! They should stand on their dignity -- snub the creatures more ! In my young days-- "
1274	1286	1288	1288	Mary	223	" Ah , there was n't a glut of us then , "
1292	1293	1296	1296	her	223	" Listen!"--she
1299	1302	1304	1305	Lady Tranmore	222	" Yes , "
1310	1315	1304	1305	Lady Tranmore	222	" There he is . "
1333	1341	1343	1344	Lady Tranmore	222	" William , how late you are ! "
1353	1362	1363	1363	Her	222	" Well , mother , are you pleased ? "
1377	1383	1385	1386	Lady Tranmore	222	" Of course I am , "
1388	1397	1385	1386	Lady Tranmore	222	" And you -- are you horribly tired ? "
1398	1410	1363	1363	Her	222	" Not a bit . Ah , Mary!--how do you do ? "
1422	1443	1450	1450	he	628	" But I do n't deny it 's very jolly to come back -- out of all that beastly scrimmage , "
1478	1486	1488	1489	Miss Lyster	225	" I expect you 've enjoyed it , "
1497	1536	1488	1489	Miss Lyster	225	" Well , when you 're in it there 's a certain excitement in wondering how you 're going to come out of it ! But one might say that , of course , of the infernal regions . "
1537	1541	1543	1544	Mary Lyster	223	" Not quite , "
1549	1574	1576	1577	Lady Tranmore	222	" Polly ! you _ are _ a Tory . Everybody else 's hell has moved -- but yours ! Thank you , mother , "
1605	1636	1593	1593	he	628	" I say , mother , I have n't seen anything as good - looking as you -- or Polly there , if she 'll forgive me -- for weeks . "
1637	1644	1650	1650	she	630	" Hold your tongue , goose , "
1655	1667	1650	1650	she	630	" What -- there were no pretty girls -- not one ? "
1668	1678	1680	1680	William	219	" Well , they did n't come my way , "
1691	1718	1680	1680	William	219	" I have gone through all the usual humbug -- and perjured my soul in all the usual ways -- without any consolation worth speaking of . "
1719	1727	1729	1730	Lady Tranmore	222	" Do n't talk nonsense , sir , "
1732	1752	1729	1730	Lady Tranmore	222	" You know you like speaking -- and you like compliments -- and you 've had plenty of both . "
1753	1762	1680	1680	William	219	" You did n't read me , mother ! "
1763	1768	1769	1769	she	222	" Did n't I ? "
1786	1802	1680	1680	William	219	" My own family at least , do n't you think , might omit that ? "
1803	1820	1826	1826	she	222	" H'm , sir -- So you did n't believe a word of your own speeches ? "
1839	1845	1846	1846	He	219	" Well , who does ? "
1858	1873	1874	1875	Mary Lyster	223	" And it 's in that spirit you 're going back into the House ? "
1895	1936	1874	1875	Mary Lyster	223	" Spirit ? What do you mean , Polly ? One plays the game , of course -- and it has its moments -- its hot corners , so to speak -- or I suppose no one would play it ! "
1937	1942	1943	1943	She	222	" And the goal ? "
1964	1977	1978	1978	He	219	" Why -- to keep the other fellows out , of course ! "
1996	2007	2009	2010	Lady Tranmore	222	" William , you 're not to talk like that , "
2026	2061	2015	2015	her	222	" It was all very well when you were quite a free - lance -- but now -- Oh ! never mind Mary -- she 's discreet -- and she knows all about it . "
2062	2100	2153	2153	She	222	" What -- that they 're thinking of giving me Hickson 's place ? Parham has just written to me -- I found the letter down - stairs -- to ask me to go and see him . "
2101	2108	2110	2111	Lady Tranmore	222	" Oh ! it 's come ? "
2126	2152	2153	2153	She	222	" Now do n't be a humbug , William , and pretend you 're not pleased . But you 'll have to work , mind ! "
2160	2176	2153	2153	She	222	" You 'll have to answer letters , mind!--you'll have to keep appointments , mind ! "
2177	2183	2247	2248	the butler	634	" Shall I ? ... Ah!--Hudson-- "
2194	2216	2187	2188	The butler	634	" His lordship , my lady , would like to see Mr. William before dinner if he could make it convenient . "
2217	2224	2226	2228	the young man	636	" Certainly , Hudson , certainly , "
2230	2243	2226	2228	the young man	636	" Tell his lordship I 'll be with him in ten minutes . "
2249	2255	2247	2248	the butler	634	departed--"How 's father , mother ? "
2256	2263	2265	2266	Lady Tranmore	222	" Oh ! much as usual , "
2270	2274	2275	2275	He	633	" And you ? "
2366	2374	2375	2375	she	222	" I 'm all right , dear , "
2387	2412	2375	2375	she	222	" Now , go on with your tea . Mary -- feed him ! I 'll go and talk to father till you come . "
2423	2430	2431	2431	he	219	" She _ is _ better ? "
2441	2466	2467	2467	Ashe	219	" Oh yes ! Your election has been everything to her -- and your letters . You know how she adores you , William . "
2473	2481	2467	2467	Ashe	219	" Yes -- isn't it bad luck ? "
2482	2485	2467	2467	Ashe	219	" William ! "
2486	2532	2467	2467	Ashe	219	" For her , I mean . Because , you know -- I ca n't live up to it . I know it 's her doing -- bless her!--that old Parham 's going to give me this thing . And it 's a perfect scandal ! "
2533	2539	2467	2467	Ashe	219	" What nonsense , William ! "
2540	2544	2545	2545	he	219	" It is ! "
2562	2593	2556	2556	his	219	" They 're going to offer me the Under - Secretaryship for Foreign Affairs , and I shall take it , I suppose , and be thankful . And do you know"--he
2599	2634	2556	2556	his	219	emphasis--"that I do n't know a word of German -- and I ca n't talk to a Frenchman for half an hour without disgracing myself . There -- that 's how we 're governed ! "
2689	2703	2681	2681	his	219	" But every one says -- you speak so well on foreign subjects . "
2704	2747	2748	2748	He	219	" Well , any fool can get up a Blue Book . Only -- luckily for me -- all the fools do n't . That 's how I 've scored sometimes . Oh ! I do n't deny that -- I've scored ! "
2776	2783	2784	2784	she	640	" And you 'll score again , "
2789	2806	2784	2784	she	640	" You 've got a wonderful opportunity , William . That 's what the Bishop says . "
2807	2813	2748	2748	He	219	" Much obliged to him ! "
2822	2863	2748	2748	He	219	" He told me he had never believed you were such an idler as other people thought you -- that he felt sure you had great endowments , and that you would use them for the good of your country , and"--she
2865	2885	2814	2814	Ashe	219	slightly--"of the Church . I wish you 'd talk to him sometimes , William . He sees so clearly . "
2886	2892	2894	2894	Ashe	219	" Oh ! does he ? "
3102	3104	3116	3116	He	219	" Polly "
3242	3244	3246	3246	her	223	" management "
3264	3271	3272	3272	he	219	" Much obliged to the Bishop , "
3280	3323	3441	3441	He	656	" I am afraid , however , I do n't take things as seriously as he does . Oh , I hope I shall behave decently -- but , good Lord , what a comedy it is ! You know the sort of articles"--he
3326	3440	3441	3441	He	656	her--"our papers will be writing to - morrow on my appointment . They 'll make me out no end of a fine fellow -- you'll see ! And , of course , the real truth is , as you and I know perfectly well , that if it had n't been for poor Freddy 's death -- and mother -- and her dinners -- and the chaps who come here -- I might have whistled for anything of the sort . And then I go down to Ledmenham and stand as a Liberal , and get all the pious Radicals to work for me ! It 's a humbugging world -- isn't it ? "
3473	3489	3490	3490	she	223	" Of course , if you choose to take it like that , you can , "
3496	3506	3490	3490	she	223	" Of course , everything can be made ridiculous . "
3507	3517	3519	3519	Ashe	219	" Well , that 's a blessing , anyway ! "
3526	3548	3522	3522	his	219	" But look here , Mary , tell me about yourself . What have you been doing?--dancing -- riding , eh ? "
3619	3627	3628	3628	he	219	" I must be off , dear , "
3633	3646	3628	3628	he	219	" You wo n't come down and see me take my seat ? "
3652	3665	3647	3647	She	630	" I think not . What did you think of your father ? "
3666	3674	3675	3675	he	219	" I do n't see much change , "
3680	3689	3647	3647	She	630	" No , he 's much the same . "
3690	3694	3695	3695	He	219	" And you ? "
3710	3716	3705	3705	his	219	" Have you been fretting ? "
3748	3752	3764	3764	Ashe	219	" I sha'n't fret now"--she
3756	3763	3764	3764	Ashe	219	moment--"now that you 've come back . "
3775	3797	3764	3764	Ashe	219	" Mother , you know -- you think a great deal too much of me -- you're too ambitious for me . "
3828	3836	3837	3837	she	222	" When do you see Lord Parham ? "
3840	3859	3815	3815	she	222	" Eight o'clock -- in his room at the House . I 'll send you up a note . "
3860	3867	3815	3815	she	222	" You 'll be home early ? "
3868	3876	3815	3815	she	222	" No -- don't wait for me . "
3891	3906	3877	3877	She	222	" I know where you 're going ! It 's Madame d'Estrées ' evening . "
3907	3915	3815	3815	she	222	" Well -- you do n't object ? "
3916	3919	3920	3920	She	222	" Object ? "
3925	3946	3920	3920	She	222	" So long as it amuses you -- You wo n't find _ one _ woman there to - night . "
3947	3954	3955	3955	he	219	" Last time there were two , "
3967	4001	4002	4002	she	222	" I know -- Lady Quantock -- and Mrs. Mallory . Now they 've deserted her , I hear . What fresh gossip has turned up I do n't know . Of course , "
4005	4022	4002	4002	she	222	" I 've been out of the world . But I believe there have been developments . "
4023	4055	3920	3920	She	222	" Well , I do n't know anything about it -- and I do n't think I want to know . She 's very agreeable , and one meets everybody there . "
4056	4064	4065	4065	she	222	" _ Everybody _ . Ungallant creature ! "
4085	4088	3920	3920	She	222	" Sorry ! Mother!"--his
4092	4104	3920	3920	She	222	her--"Do you want to marry me off directly?--I know you do ! "
4105	4123	3920	3920	She	222	" I want nothing but what you yourself should want . Of course , you must marry . "
4124	4135	3920	3920	She	222	" The young women do n't care twopence about me ! "
4136	4149	3920	3920	She	222	" William!--be a bear if you like , but not an idiot ! "
4150	4154	4155	4155	he	219	" Perfectly true , "
4158	4182	4155	4155	he	219	" not the dazzlers and the high - fliers , anyway -- the only ones it would be an excitement to carry off . "
4183	4189	4190	4190	she	222	" You know very well , "
4195	4203	4190	4190	she	222	" that now you might marry anybody . "
4212	4272	3920	3920	She	222	" Oh ! I was n't thinking about money , and that kind of thing . Well , give me time , mother -- don't hurry me ! And now I 'd better stop talking nonsense , change my clothes , and be off . Good - bye , dear -- you shall hear when the job 's perpetrated ! "
4273	4291	4293	4293	herself	222	" William , really!--don't say these things -- at least to anybody but me . You understand very well"--she
4296	4342	3920	3920	She	222	finely--"that if I had n't known , in spite of your apparent idleness , you would do any work they _ set _ you to do , to your own credit and the country 's , I 'd never have lifted a finger for you ! "
4348	4354	4355	4355	he	219	" Oh ! intriguing mother ! "
4364	4372	4355	4355	he	219	" So you admit you did it ? "
4642	4647	4648	4648	he	219	" _ Jolly ! _ "
4660	4665	4648	4648	he	219	" These beastly politics ! "
4906	4918	4920	4920	Harman	242	" What a _ cachet _ they have , these houses ! "
4926	4935	4920	4920	Harman	242	" St. James 's Place is the top ! "
4936	4947	4949	4949	Darrell	246	" Where else would you expect to find Madame d'Estrées ? "
4953	4975	4920	4920	Harman	242	" Yes -- what taste she has ! However , it was I really who advised her to take the house . "
4976	4979	4981	4981	Darrell	246	" Naturally , "
5010	5027	5029	5029	Ashe	240	" I suppose the dear lady has a hundred slaves of the lamp , as usual , "
5031	5047	5029	5029	Ashe	240	" You advise her about her house -- somebody else helps her to buy her wine-- "
5048	5057	5059	5059	Harman	242	" Not at all , my dear fellow , "
5061	5069	5059	5059	Harman	242	offended--"as if I could n't do that ! "
5070	5073	5075	5075	Darrell	246	" Hullo ! "
5086	5093	5075	5075	Darrell	246	" What a crowd there is ! "
5168	5171	5178	5178	She	227	" blue sofa "
5210	5222	5178	5178	She	227	" So you 're in ? Was it a hard fight ? "
5223	5245	5178	5178	She	227	" A hard fight ? Oh no ! One would have had to be a great fool not to get in . "
5246	5268	5178	5178	She	227	" They say you spoke very well . I suppose you promised them everything they wanted -- from the crown downward ? "
5269	5278	5280	5280	Ashe	240	" Yes -- all the usual harmless things , "
5297	5302	5178	5178	She	227	" Well!--and what else ? "
5303	5312	5313	5313	he	240	" You ca n't wait for your newspaper ? "
5332	5350	5324	5324	She	227	" Oh ! I _ know_--of course I know . Is it as good as you expected ? "
5351	5355	5356	5358	The young man	636	" As good as-- "
5365	5374	5360	5360	his	636	" What right had I to expect anything ? "
5375	5403	5324	5324	She	227	" How modest ! All the same , they want you -- and they 're very glad to get you . But you ca n't save them . "
5404	5418	5360	5360	his	636	" That 's not generally expected of Under - Secretaries , is it ? "
5419	5440	5324	5324	She	227	" A good deal 's expected of _ you _ . I talked to Lord Parham about you last night . "
5447	5456	5324	5324	She	227	" Did you ? Very kind of you . "
5457	5485	5486	5486	She	709	" Not at all . I did n't flatter you in the least . Nor did he . But they 're going to give you your chance ! "
5707	5716	5718	5718	Ashe	219	" Well , this is all very surprising , "
5720	5736	5718	5718	Ashe	219	" considering that four months ago I did not matter an old shoe to anybody . "
5737	5761	5762	5762	Ashe	219	" That was your own fault . You took no trouble . And besides -- there was your poor brother in the way . "
5767	5775	5776	5776	he	219	" No , that he never was , "
5782	5797	5776	5776	he	219	" Freddy was never in anybody 's way -- least of all in mine . "
5798	5805	5806	5806	she	709	" You know what I mean , "
5811	5836	5806	5806	she	709	" And you know what friends he and I were -- poor Freddy ! But , after all , the world 's the world . "
5837	5848	5850	5850	Ashe	219	" Yes -- we all grow on somebody 's grave , "
5878	5882	5883	5883	he	219	" Tell me ! "

5930	5933	5935	5936	Madame d'Estrées--"I	227	" Ah ! "
5936	5947	5935	5936	Madame d'Estrées--"I	227	d'Estrées--"I was coming to that -- that 's my girl Kitty-- "
5948	5952	5954	5954	Ashe	243	" Lady Kitty ! "
5959	5974	5954	5954	Ashe	243	" She 's left school ? I thought she was quite a little thing . "
5975	5994	5935	5936	Madame d'Estrées--"I	227	" She 's eighteen . Is n't she a darling ? Do n't you think her very pretty ? "
6000	6006	6007	6007	he	722	" Extraordinarily bewitching!--unlike other people ? "
6027	6071	6018	6018	her	227	" I 'm not going to describe Kitty . She 's indescribable . Besides -- you must find her out . Do go and talk to her . She 's to be half with me , half with her aunt -- Lady Grosville . "
6078	6088	6090	6091	Madame d'Estrées	227	" Oh ! do n't let 's be conventional ! "
6101	6131	6094	6094	her	227	weariness--"It 's an odious arrangement . Lady Grosville and I , as you probably know , are not on terms . She says atrocious things of me -- and I-- "
6152	6180	6181	6181	Her	227	disdain--"well , bear me witness that I do n't retaliate ! It 's not worth while . But I know that Grosville House can help Kitty . So!-- "
6194	6201	6181	6181	Her	227	" Does Lady Kitty like society ? "
6202	6212	6181	6181	Her	227	" Kitty likes anything that flatters or excites her . "
6213	6226	6181	6181	Her	227	" Then of course she likes society . Anybody as pretty as that-- "
6227	6235	6237	6238	Madame d'Estrées	227	" Ah ! how sweet of you ! "
6240	6260	6237	6238	Madame d'Estrées	227	softly--"how sweet of you ! I like you to think her pretty . I like you to say so . "
6275	6322	6270	6271	his companion	725	added--"I do n't know whether I want you to flirt with her ! You must take care . Kitty 's the most fantastic creature . Oh ! my life now'll be very different . I find she takes all my thoughts and most of my time ! "

6594	6608	6592	6592	Ashe	243	" She has the airs of a princess -- except for the chatter . "
6779	6789	6790	6790	he	731	" Present me , please , to Lady Kitty , "
6798	6802	6790	6790	he	731	" Poor child ! "

6855	6885	6853	6853	Warington	245	" Mr. Ashe wishes to be presented to you . He is an old friend of your mother 's . Congratulate him -- he has just got into Parliament . "
6928	6934	6935	6935	she	243	" I never congratulate anybody , "
6942	6948	6935	6935	she	243	" till I know them . "
6956	6963	6964	6964	he	247	" How long must I wait ? "
6977	6987	6988	6988	She	243	" That depends . Are you difficult to know ? "
7112	7121	7122	7122	she	243	" Well , I 'm easy to know , "
7130	7141	7122	7122	she	243	" but , then , I 'm not worth knowing . "
7142	7150	7094	7094	He	247	" Is one allowed to find out ? "
7151	7187	7188	7188	she	243	" Oh yes -- of course ! Do you know -- when you were over there , I _ willed _ that you should come and talk to me , and you came . Only , "
7203	7238	7094	7094	He	247	fingers--"Don't ask me how long I 've been in town . Do n't ask where I was in Paris . Do n't inquire whether I like balls ! You see , I warn you at once"--she
7241	7248	7094	7094	He	247	frankly--"that we may n't lose time . "
7249	7266	7268	7268	Ashe	247	" Well , then , I do n't see how I 'm ever to find out , "
7272	7279	7280	7280	She	243	" Whether I 'm worth knowing ? "
7288	7423	7280	7280	She	243	" Look here ! I 'll just tell you everything in a lump , and then that 'll do -- won't it ? Listen . I 'm just eighteen . I was sent to the Soeurs Blanches when I was thirteen -- the year papa died . I _ did n't _ like papa -- I'm very sorry , but I did n't ! However , that 's by - the - way . In all those years I have only seen maman once -- she does n't like children . But my aunt Grosville has some French relations -- very , _ very _ ' comme il faut , ' you understand -- and I used to go and stay with them for the holidays . Tell me!--did you ever hunt in France ? "
7424	7427	7429	7429	Ashe	247	" Never , "
7453	7461	7462	7462	she	744	" Oh ! it 's such heaven , "
7471	7515	7680	7680	Her	745	gesture--"such _ heaven _ ! First there are the old dresses -- the men look such darlings!--and then the horns , and the old ways they have--_si noble!--si distingué!_--not like your stupid English hunting . And then the dogs ! Ah ! the _ dogs_"--the
7521	7605	7462	7462	she	744	" do you know my cousin Henri actually gave me a puppy of the great breed--_the _ breed , you know -- the Dogs of St. Hubert . Or at least he _ would _ if maman would have let me bring it over . And she would n't ! Just think of that ! When there are thousands of people in France who 'd give the eyes out of their head for one . I cried all one night -- Allons!--faut pas y penser!"--she
7618	7679	7462	7462	she	744	" My cousins have got a château , you know , in the Seine - et - Oise . They 've promised to ask me next year -- when the Grand - Duke Paul comes -- if I 'll promise to behave . You see , I 'm not a bit like French girls -- I had so many affairs ! "
7690	7701	7686	7686	Ashe	247	" Are you going to tell me about them also ? "
7707	7734	7737	7737	she	745	" No ! I play fair , always -- ask anybody ! Oh , I _ do _ want to go back to France so badly ! "
7744	7763	7737	7737	she	745	" Anyway , I wo n't stay in England ! I have made up my mind to that ! "
7764	7771	7737	7737	she	745	" How long has it taken ? "
7772	7776	7777	7777	she	745	" A fortnight , "
7780	7784	7777	7777	she	745	slowly--"just a fortnight . "
7785	7795	7797	7797	Ashe	247	" That hardly seems time enough -- does it ? "
7799	7806	7797	7797	Ashe	247	" Give us a little longer . "
7807	7816	7818	7819	Lady Kitty	243	" No -- I -- I hate you ! "
7908	7917	7918	7918	she	243	" Oh , that _ detestable _ man ! "
7924	7941	7918	7918	she	243	" No -- I ca n't , I ca n't bear it . Come with me ! "
8072	8123	8066	8066	she	243	" How maman _ can ! _ Oh ! how _ bête _ you English are to applaud such a man ! You have only _ one _ poet , have n't you -- one living poet ? Ah ! I should n't have laughed if it had been he ! "
8124	8132	8134	8134	Ashe	247	" I suppose you mean Geoffrey Cliffe ? "
8138	8151	8134	8134	Ashe	247	" Nobody abroad seems ever to have heard of any one else . "
8152	8199	8066	8066	she	243	" Well , of course , I just long to know him ! Every one says he is so dangerous!--he makes all the women fall in love with him . That 's _ delicious _ ! He should n't make me ! Do you know him ? "
8200	8214	8216	8216	Ashe	247	" I knew him at Eton . We were ' swished ' together , "
8293	8300	8279	8279	she	757	" Is Lady Tranmore not well ? "
8306	8318	8279	8279	she	757	" Thank you , I left her quite well . Have you-- "
8319	8330	8279	8279	she	757	" Did maman ask her to come to - night ? "
8339	8359	8279	8279	she	757	" I do n't know . But -- we are in mourning , you see , for my brother . "
8367	8397	8279	8279	she	757	" Are you ? I 'm so sorry . I -- I always say something stupid . Then -- Lady Tranmore used to come to maman 's parties -- before-- "
8423	8439	8440	8440	he	247	" It 's I , you see , to whom your mother has been kind , "
8445	8459	8440	8440	he	247	" We 're an independent family ; we each make our own friends . "
8460	8462	8463	8463	she	757	" No-- "
8471	8484	8463	8463	she	757	" No , it 's not that . Look at that room . "

9066	9073	9074	9074	she	243	" Why are there no ladies ? "
9084	9162	9164	9164	he	800	" It -- it has always been a men 's gathering . Perhaps for some men here -- I'm sorry there are such barbarians , Lady Kitty!--that makes the charm of it . Look at that old fellow there ! He is a most famous old boy . Everybody invites him -- but he never stirs out of his den but to come here . My mother ca n't get him -- though she has tried often . "
9212	9239	9202	9203	Lady Kitty	243	" Are there many parties like this in London ? Are the ladies asked , and do n't come ? I -- I don't -- understand ! "
9246	9260	9261	9261	he	800	" There is no other hostess in London as clever as your mother , "
9278	9288	9289	9289	she	243	" The other day , at Aunt Grosville 's , "
9294	9327	9289	9289	she	243	" I asked if my two cousins might come to - night , and they looked at me as though I were mad ! Oh , _ do _ talk to me ! "
9353	9381	9382	9382	She	243	" I liked your face -- the very first moment when I saw you across the room . Do you know -- you're -- you're very handsome ! "
9405	9414	9382	9382	She	243	" I hope you wo n't mind my saying so"--his
9419	9437	9382	9382	She	243	short--"but in this country we do n't say those things . They 're not -- quite polite . "
9438	9443	9444	9444	Her	243	" Are n't they ? "
9455	9478	9449	9449	her	243	" I always called my French cousin , Henri la Fresnay , _ beau ! _ I am sure he liked it ! "
9552	9563	9564	9564	he	246	" I want you to come and see my mother ? "
9571	9579	9564	9564	he	246	" Ask Lady Grosville to bring you . "
9580	9585	9586	9586	She	243	" May I ? But-- "
9622	9651	9608	9608	his	246	" Yes -- I'll come . _ We_--you and I -- are a little bit cousins too -- aren't we ? We talked about you at the Grosvilles . "
9652	9664	9665	9665	he	246	" Was our ' great - great ' the same person ? "
9670	9714	9665	9665	he	246	" Hope it was a decent ' great - great . ' Some of mine are n't much to boast of . Well , at any rate , let 's _ be _ cousins -- whether we are or no , shall we ? "
9724	9737	9738	9738	she	243	" And we 're going to meet -- the week after next ! "

9760	9788	9738	9738	she	243	" And _ then _ I 'll ask your advice -- I'll make you tell me -- a hundred things ! That 's a bargain -- mind ! "
9789	9804	9814	9815	the crowd	787	" Kitty ! Come and help me with tea -- there 's a darling ! "

10046	10049	10051	10051	Darrell	246	" Well , "
10061	10077	10051	10051	Darrell	246	" so you 're safely in . Congratulate you , old fellow . Anything else ? "
10078	10098	10132	10133	The speaker	623	" Yes . They 've offered me Hickson 's place . More fools they , do n't you think ? "
10099	10131	10051	10051	Darrell	246	" Good ! Upon my word , Bill , you 've got your foot in the stirrup now ! Hope you 'll continue to be civil to poor devils like me . "
10278	10292	10294	10294	Darrell	246	" Which means , of course , that they want you to marry , "
10296	10307	10294	10294	Darrell	246	" Well , you 've only to throw the handkerchief . "
10347	10350	10342	10342	Ashe	243	" rot , "
10369	10383	10506	10506	Darrell	246	" How does she get all those people together ? It 's astonishing ! "
10384	10395	10397	10397	Darrell	246	" Well , I always liked Madame d'Estrées well enough , "
10399	10419	10397	10397	Darrell	246	" but , upon my word , she has done a beastly mean thing in bringing that girl over . "
10420	10422	10506	10506	Darrell	246	" You mean?"--Ashe
10423	10431	10397	10397	Darrell	246	hesitated--"that her own position is too doubtful ? "
10432	10439	10440	10440	Darrell	246	" Doubtful , my dear fellow ! "
10444	10498	10440	10440	Darrell	246	" I never really understood what it all meant till the other night when old Lady Grosville took and told me -- more at any rate than I knew before . The Grosvilles are on the war - path , and they regard the coming of this poor child as the last straw . "
10499	10502	10504	10504	Ashe	243	" Why ? "
10511	10531	10506	10506	Darrell	246	" Well , you know the story of Madame d'Estrées ' step - daughter -- old Blackwater 's daughter ? "
10532	10551	10553	10553	Ashe	243	" Ah ! by his first marriage ? I knew it was something about the step - daughter , "
10593	10597	10598	10598	he	246	" Look here , "
10603	10620	10598	10598	he	246	" do n't tell me any more . I do n't want to hear any more . "
10621	10624	10626	10626	Darrell	246	" Why ? "
10631	10632	10598	10598	he	246	" Because"--Ashe
10637	10668	10598	10598	he	246	" Well , I do n't want it to be made impossible for me to go to Madame d'Estrées ' again . Besides , we 've just eaten her salt . "
10669	10676	10678	10678	Darrell	246	" You 're a good friend ! "
11534	11536	11531	11532	Madame d'Estrées	690	" evenings "
11762	11771	11772	11772	he	863	" Is it to be a large party ? "
11778	11794	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Oh ! they always fill the house . A good many came down yesterday . "
11795	11803	11805	11805	Ashe	243	" Well , I 'm not curious , "
11807	11814	11805	11805	Ashe	243	" except as to one person . "
11815	11818	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Who ? "
11819	11824	11805	11805	Ashe	243	" Lady Kitty Bristol . "
11829	11848	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Yes , poor child , I heard from the Grosville girls that she was to be here . "
11849	11856	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Why ' poor child ' ? "
11857	11879	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" I do n't know . Quite the wrong expression , I admit . It should be ' poor hostess . ' "
11880	11885	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Oh!--the Grosvilles complain ? "
11886	11906	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" No . They 're only on tenter - hooks . They never know what she will do next . "
11907	11914	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" How good for the Grosvilles ! "
11915	11925	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" You think society is the better for shocks ? "
11926	11948	11825	11826	Mary Lyster	223	" Lady Grosville can do with them , anyway . What a masterful woman ! But I 'll back Lady Kitty . "
11949	11957	11959	11959	Mary	223	" I have n't seen her yet , "
11961	11974	11959	11959	Mary	223	" I hear she is a very odd - looking little thing . "
11975	11979	11981	11981	Ashe	243	" Extremely pretty , "
11983	11986	11987	11987	Mary	223	" Really ? "
11992	12003	11987	11987	Mary	223	" Well , now I shall know what you admire . "
12004	12019	12021	12021	Ashe	243	" Oh , my tastes are horribly catholic -- I admire so many people , "
12067	12077	12083	12083	her	244	" Well , I 'm glad you got in , "
12089	12115	12079	12080	Lady Grosville	244	" because we are connections . But of course I regard the loss of a seat to our side just now as a great disaster . "
12116	12124	12126	12126	Ashe	243	" Very grasping , on your part ! "
12128	12143	12126	12126	Ashe	243	" You 've had it all your own way lately . Think of Portsmouth ! "
12282	12289	12291	12291	Ashe	243	" Why are we so early ? "
12298	12307	12291	12291	Ashe	243	" I thought I should be disgracefully late . "
12477	12481	12459	12459	he	219	" à fleur de tête"--of
12520	12522	12545	12546	Lady Grosville	244	" floridly "
12533	12543	12545	12546	Lady Grosville	244	" Did n't you get the message about dinner ? "
12556	12629	12551	12551	he	219	" Very remiss of Parkin . I always tell him he loses his head directly the party goes into double figures . We had to put off dinner a quarter of an hour because of Kitty Bristol , who missed her train at St. Pancras , and only arrived half an hour ago . By - the - way , I suppose you have already seen her -- at that woman 's ? "
12630	12645	12647	12647	Ashe	243	" I met her a week or two ago , at Madame d'Estrées ' , "
12662	12670	12551	12551	he	219	" What did you think of her ? "
12671	12677	12679	12679	Ashe	243	" A charming young lady , "
12683	12690	12679	12679	Ashe	243	" What else should I think ? "
12691	12699	12701	12702	Lady Grosville	244	" A lamb thrown to the wolves , "
12706	12718	12701	12702	Lady Grosville	244	" How that woman _ could _ do such a thing ! "
12719	12728	12730	12730	Ashe	243	" I saw nothing lamblike about Lady Kitty , "
12732	12742	12730	12730	Ashe	243	" And do you include me among the wolves ? "
12755	12765	12766	12766	she	244	" You should n't go to such a house , "
12769	12789	12766	12766	she	244	boldly--"I suppose I may say that without offence , William , as I 've known you from a boy . "
12790	12812	12813	12813	His	900	" Say anything you like , my dear Lady Grosville ! So you -- believe evil things -- of Madame d'Estrées ? "
12946	12957	12959	12960	Lady Grosville	244	" I have known a fair number of bad people , "
12965	12998	12959	12960	Lady Grosville	244	voice--"and a good many wicked women . But for meanness and vileness combined , the things I know of the woman who was Blackwater 's wife have no equal in my experience ! "
13019	13049	13007	13007	Ashe	243	" I am sorry to hear you say that , partly because I like Madame d'Estrées , and partly -- because -- I was particularly attracted by Lady Kitty . "
13056	13073	13050	13051	Lady Grosville	244	" Do n't marry her , William!--don't marry her ! She comes of a bad stock . "
13079	13096	13104	13105	Lady Grosville	244	" She is your own niece . Might n't a man dare -- on that guarantee ? "
13097	13102	13104	13105	Lady Grosville	244	" Not at all , "
13109	13150	13104	13105	Lady Grosville	244	" I was a hop out of kin . Besides -- a Methodist governess saved me ; she converted me , at eighteen , and I owe her everything . But my brothers -- and all the rest of us ! "
13159	13197	13151	13151	She	244	" What 's the good of being mealy mouthed about it ? All the world knows it . A good many of us were mad -- and I sometimes think I see more than eccentricity in Kitty . "
13198	13204	13206	13206	Ashe	243	" Who was Madame d'Estrées ? "
13226	13239	13240	13240	she	244	" Well , I can tell you a good deal about that , "
13243	13247	13240	13240	she	244	" Ah!--another time ! "
13332	13341	13343	13347	the master of the house	912	" Adelina , need we wait any longer ? "
13357	13367	13369	13370	Lady Grosville	244	" Certainly not -- she has had ample time , "
13436	13444	13446	13449	the new - comer	918	" Oh ! I 'm so sorry , "
13457	13515	13446	13449	the new - comer	918	" But I could n't leave him up - stairs , Aunt Lina ! He 'd eaten one of my shoes , and begun upon the other . And Julie 's afraid of him . He bit her last week . _ May _ he sit on my knee ? I know I can keep him quiet ! "
13519	13533	13446	13449	the new - comer	918	" A SLIM GIRL IN WHITE AT THE FAR END OF THE LARGE ROOM "
13729	13732	13734	13735	Lady Grosville	244	" Kitty ! "
13740	13755	13734	13735	Lady Grosville	244	" what a dreadful noise ! Pray give the dog to Parkin at once . "
13765	13786	13734	13735	Lady Grosville	244	" _ Please _ , Aunt Lina!--I'm afraid he 'll bite ! But he 'll be quite good with me . "
13787	13808	13810	13811	Lady Grosville	244	" Why _ did _ you bring him , Kitty ? We ca n't have such a creature at dinner ! "
13822	13856	13815	13816	Lord Grosville	265	" How do you do , Kitty ? Had n't you better put down the dog and come and be introduced to Mr. Rankine , who is to take you in to dinner ? "
13894	13901	13902	13902	she	243	" You do n't mind him ? "
13914	13926	13902	13902	she	243	" We 'll manage him between us , wo n't we ? "
14092	14100	14102	14103	Lady Kitty	243	" I shall never get over this , "
14135	14145	14147	14147	Ashe	243	" I do n't know that you deserve to , "
14239	14248	14250	14250	Kitty	243	" I vow it was not my fault , "
14255	14335	14250	14250	Kitty	243	" I was not allowed to have the dog I should have had . You 'd never have found a dog of St. Hubert condescending to bedroom slippers ! But as I had to have a dog -- and Colonel Warington gave me this one three days ago -- and he has already ruined half maman 's things , and no one could manage him but me , I just had to bring him , and trust to Providence . "
14336	14346	14348	14348	Ashe	243	" I have been here a good many times , "
14350	14375	14348	14348	Ashe	243	" and I never yet saw a dog in the sanctuary . Do you know that Pitt once wrote a speech in the library ? "
14376	14393	14394	14394	Kitty	243	" Did he ? I 'm sure it never made such a stir as Ponto did . "
14412	14418	14420	14420	Ashe	243	" You brazen it out , "
14422	14433	14420	14420	Ashe	243	" but how are you going to appease Lady Grosville ? "
14453	14474	14439	14439	She	243	" I do n't know . But I must do it somehow . I do n't want any more worries . "
14492	14498	14499	14499	he	941	" Have you been worried ? "
14542	14555	14518	14518	she	243	" Will you come a walk with me to - morrow morning ? "
14556	14559	14561	14561	Ashe	243	" Proud , "
14563	14567	14561	14561	Ashe	243	" What time ? "
14568	14580	14581	14581	she	243	" As soon as we can get rid of these people , "
14619	14623	14624	14624	she	243	" Your cousin ? "
14635	14653	14624	14624	she	243	" Your cousin ? I don't -- well , I do n't think I shall like her . "
14654	14661	14663	14663	Ashe	243	" That 's a great pity , "
14665	14669	14670	14670	she	243	" For me ? "
14675	14697	14716	14716	her	243	" For both , of course ! My mother 's very fond of Miss Lyster . She 's often with us . "
14698	14701	14703	14703	Kitty	243	" Oh ! "
14730	14756	14716	14716	her	243	" She does not interest me in the least ! She has no ideas ! I 'm sure she has no ideas . Has she ? "
14763	14771	14757	14757	She	243	" Every one calls her very clever . "
14776	14795	14772	14772	Kitty	243	" That 's nothing to do with it . It 's not the clever people who have ideas . "
14877	14889	14890	14890	she	243	" I suppose you -- everybody -- thinks her very agreeable ? "
14902	14910	14912	14912	Ashe	243	" She is a most excellent gossip , "
14914	14924	14912	14912	Ashe	243	" I always go to her for the news . "
14929	14939	14890	14890	she	243	" I can see that already she detests me . "
14940	14946	14890	14890	she	243	" In half an hour ? "
14951	14974	14982	14982	she	243	" She has looked at me twice -- about . But she has made up her mind -- and she never changes . "
14988	15020	14982	14982	she	243	" I suppose your English dining - rooms are all like this ? One might be sitting in a hearse . And the pictures -- no ! _ Quelles horreurs _ ! "
15076	15098	15066	15066	she	243	" But the library -- that was _ bien_--ah ! _ tr - rès , tr - rès _ bien _ ! "
15142	15155	15157	15157	Ashe	243	" You 've not yet seen what there is to see here , "
15161	15166	15157	15157	Ashe	243	" Look behind you . "

15342	15348	15349	15349	she	243	" It is too beautiful ! "
15361	15371	15349	15349	she	243	" I do n't want to see it again . "
15372	15381	15383	15383	Ashe	243	" I thought it would give you pleasure , "
15412	15417	15419	15419	Kitty	243	" So it did , "
15430	15431	15419	15419	Kitty	243	" but"--her
15433	15460	15462	15462	she	243	dropped--"when one 's unhappy -- very unhappy -- things like that -- things like _ Heaven_--hurt ! Oh , what a _ fool _ I am ! "
15484	15503	15477	15477	Ashe	243	" Look here , you know this wo n't do . I thought we were to be cousins . "
15504	15507	15509	15509	Kitty	243	" Well ? "
15518	15533	15477	15477	Ashe	243	" And I understood that I was to be taken into respectable cousinly counsel ? "
15534	15537	15539	15539	Kitty	243	" Well ? "
15546	15557	15539	15539	Kitty	243	" I ca n't do it here , can I ? "
15561	15582	15558	15558	Ashe	243	" Well , anyhow , we 're going to sample the garden to - morrow morning , are n't we ? "
15583	15588	15590	15590	Kitty	243	" I suppose so , "
15621	15627	15628	15628	she	243	" What 's his name ? "
15639	15648	15632	15632	her	243	" Perhaps I ought to talk to him ? "
15649	15655	15657	15657	Ashe	243	" Of course you ought , "

16053	16059	16061	16062	Lady Grosville	244	" Kitty is ridiculously overdressed , "
16064	16084	16061	16062	Lady Grosville	244	" I hope we shall soon change that . My girls are going to take her to their woman . "

16266	16271	16272	16272	she	243	" Who is that ? "
16353	16375	16350	16350	her	223	" Vous parlez Français?--vous êtes Française ? Ah ! ça me fait tant de bien ! Voyons ! voyons!--causons un peu ! "
16483	16488	16490	16491	Lady Edith	271	" What beautiful French ! "
16511	16526	16507	16508	Mary Lyster	223	" She has been at school , of course , in a French convent . "
16542	16559	16561	16562	Lady Grosville	244	" I am afraid these French convent schools are not at all what they should be , "
17162	17168	17170	17172	the delighted Dean	1027	" My dear young lady , "
17174	17239	17241	17241	his	987	" I never find anybody who can talk of these things -- it is really astonishing . Ah , _ now _ , we English know nothing of France -- nor they of us . Why , I was a mere school - boy then , and I had a passion for their society , and their books -- for their _ plays_--dare I confess it?"--he
17247	17253	17241	17241	his	987	hostess--"their plays , above all ! "
17269	17311	17259	17260	The Dean	987	" My mother shared it . When I came over for my Eton holidays , she and I lived at the Théâtre - Français . Ah , those were days ! _ I _ remember Mademoiselle Mars in ' Hernani . ' "
17629	17634	17635	17635	she	243	" You made me ! "
17648	17651	17644	17645	The Dean	987	" Brava ! "
17689	17695	17696	17696	he	265	" My dear young lady , "
17699	17706	17696	17696	he	265	" you have the most extraordinary talent-- "
17729	17739	17718	17718	she	244	" William , kindly order Mrs. Wilson 's carriage . "

17812	17858	17803	17803	she	1055	" but another time I will ask you to confine yourself to Racine and Corneille . In England we have to be very careful about French writers . There are , however , if I remember right , some fine passages in ' Athalie . ' "
17904	17947	17949	17951	the old man	1012	" She recites wonderfully ! And Victor Hugo is a classic , please , my lady -- just as much as the rest of them . Ah , well , no doubt , no doubt , there might be things more suitable . "
17976	17985	17949	17951	the old man	1012	" But , do you know , Lady Kitty "
18005	18061	17949	17951	the old man	1012	Grosville--"you reminded me all the time so remarkably -- in your voice -- certain inflections -- of your sister -- your step - sister , is n't it?--Lady Alice ? You know , of course , she is close to you to - day -- just the other side the park -- with the Sowerbys ? "
18122	18126	18128	18128	Kitty	243	" My sister ? "
18130	18134	18117	18117	Ashe	243	" My sister ? "

20607	20743	20598	20598	he	265	" Blackwater -- the old ruffian -- when he was dying had a moment of remorse . He wrote to my wife and asked her to look after his girls , ' For God 's sake , Lina , see if you can help Alice -- Wensleydale 's a perfect brute . ' That was the first light we had on the situation , for Adelina had long before washed her hands of him ; and we knew that _ she _ hated us . Well , we tried ; of course we tried . But so long as her husband lived Alice would have nothing to say to any of us . I suppose she thought that for her boy 's sake she 'd better keep a bad business to herself as much as possible-- "
20744	20749	20751	20751	Ashe	243	" Wensleydale -- Wensleydale ? "
20764	20788	20751	20751	Ashe	243	" You mean the man who distinguished himself in the Crimea ? He died last year -- at Naples , was n't it ? "
21065	21158	21061	21061	she	288	" She told Lina and myself the whole story . You 'd have thought the woman was possessed . My wife -- she 's not of the crying sort , nor am I. But she cried , and I believe -- well , I can tell you it was enough to move a stone . And when she 'd done , she just went away , and locked her door , and let no one say a word to her . She has told one or two other relations and friends , and-- "
21159	21169	21061	21061	she	288	" And the relations and friends have told others ? "
21170	21179	21181	21181	Grosville	265	" Well , I can answer for myself , "
21186	21220	21181	21181	Grosville	265	" This happened three months ago . I never have told , and never shall tell , all the details as she told them to us . But we have let enough be known-- "
21221	21228	21061	21061	she	288	" Enough?--enough to damn Madame d'Estrées ? "
21229	21261	21181	21181	Grosville	265	" Oh , well , as far as the women were concerned , she was mostly that already . There are other tales going about . I expect you know them . "
21262	21271	21273	21273	Ashe	243	" No , I do n't know them , "
21282	21289	21290	21290	he	265	" Well , this finished it , "
21293	21297	21299	21299	Ashe	243	" Poor child ! "
21316	21319	21321	21322	Lord Grosville	265	" Alice ? "
21324	21327	21321	21322	Lord Grosville	265	" No . "
21328	21350	21358	21359	Lord Grosville	265	" Oh ! you mean Kitty ? Yes , I had forgotten her for the moment . Yes , poor child . "
21362	21370	21358	21359	Lord Grosville	265	" What do you think of her ? "
21371	21374	21376	21376	Ashe	243	" I ? "
21382	21393	21376	21376	Ashe	243	" I do n't know . She 's obviously very pretty-- "
21394	21399	21401	21402	Lord Grosville	265	" And a handful ! "
21404	21412	21414	21414	Ashe	243	" Oh , quite plainly a handful , "
21435	21447	21449	21451	the old man	1012	" Not much shyness left in that young woman -- eh ? "
21453	21578	21449	21451	the old man	1012	" She tells my girls such stories of her French doings -- my wife 's had to stop it . She seems to have had all sorts of love - affairs already . And , of course , she 'll have any number over here -- sure to . Some unscrupulous fellow'll get hold of her , for naturally the right sort wo n't marry her . I do n't know what we can do . Adelina offered to take her altogether . But that woman would n't hear of it . She wrote Lina rather a good letter -- on her dignity -- and that kind of thing . We gave her an opening , and , by Jove ! she took it . "
21579	21593	21449	21451	the old man	1012	" And meanwhile Lady Kitty has no dealings with her step - sister ? "
21594	21675	21449	21451	the old man	1012	" You heard what she said . Extraordinary girl ! to let the thing out plump like that . Just like the blood . They say anything that comes into their heads . If we had known that Alice was to be with the Sowerbys this week - end , my wife would certainly have put Kitty off . It would be uncommonly awkward if they were to meet -- here for instance . Hullo ! Is it getting late ? "
21704	21721	21723	21723	Ashe	243	" I am afraid Lady Kitty understands there is something wrong with her mother 's position , "
21729	21742	21744	21748	the white - haired Englishman	1230	" I dare say . Brought up in Paris , you see , "
21754	21765	21744	21748	the white - haired Englishman	1230	" Of course , she knows everything she should n't . "
21766	21775	21777	21777	Ashe	243	" Brought up in a convent , please , "
21781	21799	21777	21777	Ashe	243	" And I thought the French _ girl _ was the most innocent and ignorant thing alive . "
21808	21837	21851	21851	she	1231	" You ask my wife what she thinks about French convents . She knows -- she 's had lots of Catholic relations . She 'll tell you tales . "
22829	22873	22826	22827	Lady Kitty	243	" Ciel ! what a night!--and how the flowers smell ! And the stars -- I adore the stars ! Mademoiselle -- come here ! Mademoiselle ! answer me -- I wo n't tell tales -- now do you--_really and truly_--believe in God ? "
22896	22899	22900	22900	he	1256	" Tormentor ! "
22903	22952	22900	22900	he	1256	himself--"must you put a woman through her theological paces at this time of night ? Ca n't you go to sleep , you little whirlwind?--What 's to be done ? If I shut my window the noise will scare her . But I ca n't stand eavesdropping here . "
23263	23280	23313	23313	She	243	" Ah!--but I am a pig , to keep you up like this ! Allez dormir ! "
23289	23312	23313	23313	She	243	" I ? Oh no ! Why should one go to bed ? It is in the night one begins to live . "
23326	23338	23313	23313	She	243	" You remember ? You promise ? You have the letter ? "
23357	23379	23412	23412	her	243	" Eight o'clock ! And I keep you like this . I am a brute beast ! Allez -- allez vite ! "
24216	24220	24221	24221	he	1291	" Lady Kitty ! "
24262	24269	24270	24270	she	256	" I have seen my sister , "
24273	24292	24270	24270	she	256	" and she hates me . What have I done ? I think I shall die of despair ! "
24374	24376	24372	24372	she	256	" willed "
24538	24546	24547	24547	he	1291	" Why should you be in despair ? "
24554	24572	24547	24547	he	1291	" Tell me . Let me try and help you . Was your sister unkind to you ? "
24629	24635	24636	24636	she	256	" I do n't know , "
24646	24667	24643	24643	her	256	" I do n't know whether it was unkind . Perhaps it was only what we deserve , maman and I. "
24668	24671	24673	24673	Ashe	219	" You ! "
24675	24678	24679	24679	she	256	" Yes , "
24684	24727	24679	24679	she	256	" Who 's going to separate between maman and me ? If she 's done mean , shocking things , the people she 's done them to will hate me too . They _ shall _ hate me ! It 's right . "
24786	24804	24805	24805	he	219	" I am quite sure no one will ever hate you for what you have n't done , "
24810	24842	24805	24805	he	219	" That would be abominably unfair . But , you see , I do n't understand -- and I do n't like -- I do n't wish -- to ask questions . "
24843	24850	24851	24851	she	256	" _ Do _ ask questions ! "
24860	24873	24874	24874	she	256	" That 's just what I want you to do -- Only , "
24883	24935	24874	24874	she	256	" I should n't know what to answer . I am played with , and treated as a baby ! There is something horrible the matter -- and no one trusts me -- every one keeps me in the dark . No one ever thinks whether I am miserable or not . "
25020	25028	25029	25029	he	219	" Why should you torment yourself so ? "
25057	25102	25051	25051	he	219	" Is n't it better to forget old griefs ? You ca n't help what happened years ago -- you ca n't undo it . You 've got to live your own life--_happily _ ! And I just wish you 'd set about it . "
25193	25206	25207	25207	she	256	" Of course , you do n't understand a word about it , "
25210	25225	25207	25207	she	256	" or you could n't talk like that . But I 'll tell you . "
25239	25308	25207	25207	she	256	" My sister -- came here -- because I sent for her . I made mademoiselle go with a letter . Of course , I knew there was a mystery -- I knew the Grosvilles did not want us to meet -- I knew that she and maman hated each other . But maman will tell me nothing -- and I have a _ right _ to know . "
25309	25319	25321	25321	Ashe	219	" No , you have no right to know , "
25331	25338	25339	25339	she	1327	" I have -- I have ! "
25344	25551	25207	25207	she	256	" Well , I told my sister to meet me here -- I had forgotten , you see , all about you ! My mind was so full of Alice . And when she came I felt as if it was a dream -- a horrible , tragic dream . You know -- she is _ so _ like me -- which means , I suppose , that we are both like papa . Only her face -- it 's not handsome , oh no -- but it 's stern -- and -- yes , noble ! I was proud of her . I would like to have gone on my knee and kissed her dress . But she would not take my hand -- she would hardly speak to me . She said she had come , because it was best , now that I was in England , that we should meet once , and understand that we _ could n't _ meet -- that we could never , never be friends . She said that she hated my mother -- that for years she had kept silence , but that now she meant to punish maman -- to drive her from London . And then"--the
25558	25604	25632	25632	Kitty	256	memory--"she came close to me , and she looked into my eyes , and she said , ' Yes , we 're like each other --- we're like our father -- and it would be better for us both if we had never been born-- ' "
25605	25610	25612	25612	Ashe	219	" Ah , cruel ! "
25643	25676	25632	25632	Kitty	256	" No . I think it 's true . I often think I 'm not made to be happy . I ca n't ever be happy -- it 's not in me . "
25677	25688	25690	25690	Ashe	219	" It 's in you to say foolish things then ! "
25760	25770	25771	25771	She	256	what--"as an animal shrinks from shadows in the twilight . "
25864	25885	25849	25849	she	256	" Do you know why I shall never be happy ? It is because I have such a bad temper . "
25886	25890	25892	25892	Ashe	219	" Have you ? "
25903	25948	25896	25896	She	256	" You do n't believe it ? If you had been in the convent , you would have believed it . I 'm mad sometimes -- quite mad ; with pride , I suppose , and vanity . The Soeurs said it was that . "
25949	25957	25959	25959	Ashe	219	" They had to explain it somehow , "
25961	25981	25959	25959	Ashe	219	" But I am quite sure that if I lived in a convent I should have a furious temper . "
25982	25985	25986	25986	she	256	" You ! "
25992	26073	25986	25986	she	256	" You could n't be ill - tempered anywhere . That 's the one thing I do n't like about you -- you're too calm -- too -- too satisfied . It's -- Well ! you said a sharp thing to me , so I do n't see why I should n't say one to you . You should n't look as though you enjoyed your life so much . It 's _ bourgeois _ ! It is , indeed . "
26255	26261	26240	26240	She	256	" And you scorn success ? "
26262	26266	26267	26267	She	256	" Scorn it ! "
26290	26309	26267	26267	She	256	" Scorn it ! What nonsense ! But everybody who has n't got it hates those who have . "
26310	26316	26318	26318	Ashe	219	" Do n't hate me ! "
26322	26325	26326	26326	she	256	" Yes , "
26332	26392	26393	26393	She	256	" I must . Do you know why I was such a wild - cat at school ? Because some of the other girls were more important than I -- much more important -- and richer -- and more beautiful -- and people paid them more attention . And that seemed to _ burn _ the heart in me . "
26405	26471	26393	26393	She	256	" You know the French word _ panache _ ? Well , that 's what I care for --that 's what I _ adore _ ! To be the first -- the best -- the most distinguished . To be envied -- and pointed at -- obeyed when I lift my finger -- and then to come to some great , glorious , tragic end ! "
26476	26504	26472	26472	Ashe	219	" Lady Kitty , I do n't like to hear you talk like this . It 's wild , and it 's also -- I beg your pardon-- "
26505	26510	26511	26511	she	256	" In bad taste ? "
26519	26543	26511	26511	she	256	" That 's what you meant , is n't it ? You said it to me before , when I called you handsome . "
26544	26547	26548	26548	he	219	" Pshaw ! "
26598	26606	26607	26607	she	256	" Do n't be angry with me ! "
26617	26654	26607	26607	she	256	" Do n't you understand how hard it is -- to have that nature -- and then to come here out of the convent -- where one had lived on dreams -- and find one 's self-- "
26670	26674	26675	26675	he	219	" Find yourself ? "
26678	26683	26684	26684	she	256	" Everybody scorns me ! "
26694	26712	26691	26691	Ashe	219	" You know it 's true . My mother is not received . Can you deny that ? "
26713	26719	26721	26721	Ashe	219	" She has many friends , "
26723	26758	26691	26691	Ashe	219	" She is _ not received _ . When I speak of her no one answers me . Lady Grosville asked me here--_me_--out of charity . It would be thought a disgrace to marry me-- "
26759	26765	26691	26691	Ashe	219	" Look here , Lady Kitty!-- "
26766	26768	26776	26776	she	256	" And I"--she
26782	26820	26776	26776	she	256	enemies--"I would never _ look _ at a man who did not think it the glory of his life to win me . So you see , I shall never marry . But then the dreadful thing is-- "
26831	26851	26821	26821	She	256	" That I have no loyalty to maman -- I -- I do n't think I even love her . "
26857	26864	26865	26865	he	219	" You do n't mean that , "
26868	26874	26875	26875	she	256	" I think I do , "
26878	26933	26875	26875	she	256	" I had a horrid childhood . I wo n't tell tales ; but , you see , I do n't _ know _ maman . I know the Soeurs much better . And then for some one you do n't know -- to have to -- to have to bear -- this horrible thing-- "
26949	26956	26957	26957	he	219	" You sha'n't bear anything horrible , "
26963	26990	26957	26957	he	219	" There are plenty of people who will take care of that . Do you mind telling me -- have there been special difficulties just lately ? "
26991	26995	26996	26996	she	256	" Oh yes , "
27004	27037	26996	26996	she	256	" awful ! Maman 's debts are -- well -- ridiculous . For that alone I do n't think she 'll be able to stay in London -- apart from -- Alice . "
27053	27059	27060	27060	she	256	" What will she do ? "
27067	27076	27060	27060	she	256	" How will she punish us?--and why?--for what ? "
27180	27188	27190	27190	Kitty	256	" Then I must go with her , "
27195	27204	27192	27192	Ashe	219	" Of course , if she wishes it . "
27205	27225	27227	27227	Kitty	256	" But I do n't know that she will wish it . She is not very fond of me , "
27231	27250	27227	27227	Kitty	256	" Yes , I would like to stay with Lady Tranmore . But will your cousin be there ? "
27251	27255	27192	27192	Ashe	219	" Miss Lyster ? "
27259	27273	27227	27227	Kitty	256	" How can I tell ? Of course , she is often there . "
27274	27280	27282	27282	Kitty	256	" It is quite curious , "
27287	27307	27282	27282	Kitty	256	" how we dislike each other . And it is so odd . You know most people like me ! "
27329	27337	27338	27338	she	256	" That 's always been my difficulty , "
27342	27396	27338	27338	she	256	" till now . Everybody spoils me . I always get my own way . In the convent I was indulged and flattered , and then they wondered that I made all sorts of follies . I want a guide -- that 's quite certain -- somebody to tell me what to do . "
27397	27406	27408	27408	Ashe	219	" I would offer myself for the post , "
27410	27428	27408	27408	Ashe	219	" but that I feel perfectly sure that you would never follow anybody 's advice in anything . "
27429	27435	27436	27436	she	256	" Yes , I would , "
27441	27444	27436	27436	she	256	" I would-- "
27450	27456	27445	27445	Ashe	219	" Ah , if you would-- "
27461	27465	27457	27457	She	256	" Do you see "
27474	27527	27445	27445	Ashe	219	path--"they are coming back from church . You understand?--_nobody _ must know about my sister . It will come round to Aunt Lina , of course ; but I hope it 'll be when I 'm gone . If she knew now , I should go back to London to - day . "
27560	27569	27570	27570	she	256	" I wish I had n't seen her , "
27698	27707	27693	27693	Ashe	219	" You want to meet him so much ? "
27708	27718	27682	27682	She	256	" Of course . Does n't all the world ? "
27770	27783	27749	27750	Whereupon Kitty	315	" Because the man 's a coxcomb and the women spoil him ? "
27784	27788	27749	27750	Whereupon Kitty	315	" A coxcomb ! "
27795	27809	27810	27810	she	315	" Pray , is he not a great traveller?--_a very _ great traveller ? "
27816	27824	27749	27750	Whereupon Kitty	315	" Certainly , by his own account . "
27825	27832	27749	27750	Whereupon Kitty	315	" And a most brilliant writer ? "
27833	27836	27838	27838	Ashe	219	" Macaulayese , "
27842	27850	27838	27838	Ashe	219	" and not very good at that . "
28227	28229	28223	28223	Ashe	219	" Henri "
28315	28351	28302	28302	she	244	" I see you are interested in Kitty , and I feel as if I must tell you , and ask your opinion . William , do you know what that child has been doing ? "
28359	28366	28302	28302	she	244	" Ah!--what have you been discovering ? "
28367	28376	28302	28302	she	244	" Grosville told you the story last night . "
28380	28431	28302	28302	she	244	" Well -- Kitty wrote to Alice this morning -- and they met . Alice has kept her room since -- prostrate -- so the Sowerbys tell me . I have just had a note from Mrs. Sowerby . Was n't it an extraordinary , an indelicate thing to do ? "
28490	28499	28501	28501	his	219	" I should have thought it very natural , "
28511	28515	28508	28508	her	244	" Natural!--when she knows-- "
28516	28522	28524	28524	Ashe	219	" How can she know ? "
28528	28595	28524	28524	Ashe	219	" How can such a child know or guess anything ? She only knows that there is some black charge against her mother , on which no one will enlighten her . How can they ? But meanwhile her mother is ostracized , and she feels herself dragged into the disgrace , not understanding why or wherefore . Could anything be more pathetic -- more touching ? "
28624	28635	28636	28636	she	244	" Oh -- of course , it 's very sad , "
28637	28665	28613	28614	Lady Grosville	244	said--"extremely sad . But I should have thought Kitty was clever enough to understand at least that Alice must have some grave reason for breaking with her mother-- "
28666	28678	28680	28680	Ashe	219	" Do n't you all forget what a child she is , "
28682	28686	28680	28680	Ashe	219	indignantly--"not yet nineteen ! "
28687	28694	28696	28697	Lady Grosville	244	" Yes , that 's true , "
28701	28723	28696	28697	Lady Grosville	244	" I must confess I find it difficult to judge her fairly . She 's so different from my own girls . "
28789	28803	28786	28786	she	244	" So you think , William , I had better leave Kitty alone ? "
28804	28808	28809	28809	Ashe	219	" About what ? "
28818	28835	28809	28809	Ashe	219	" Do n't put too much responsibility on me . I know nothing about young ladies . "
28836	28847	28849	28850	Lady Grosville	244	" I do n't know that I do -- much , "
28854	28862	28849	28850	Lady Grosville	244	" My own daughters are so exceptional . "
28893	28902	28904	28905	Lady Grosville	244	" At any rate , I see clearly , "
28911	28940	28904	28905	Lady Grosville	244	" that you 're very sorry for Kitty . Of course , it 's very nice of you , and I find it 's what most people feel . "
28941	28954	28956	28956	Ashe	219	" Hang it ! dear Lady Grosville , why should n't they ? "
28964	28989	28956	28956	Ashe	219	" If ever there was a forlorn little person on earth , I thought Lady Kitty was that person at lunch to - day . "
28990	28999	29001	29002	Lady Grosville	244	" And after that absurd exhibition last night ! "
29008	29023	29001	29002	Lady Grosville	244	" You never know where to have her . You think she looked ill ? "
29024	29035	29037	29037	Ashe	219	" I am sure she has got a splitting headache , "
29041	29070	29037	29037	Ashe	219	" And why you and Grosville should n't be as sorry for her as for Lady Alice I ca n't imagine . _ She 's _ done nothing . "
29071	29078	29080	29081	Lady Grosville	244	" No , that 's true , "
29091	29118	29088	29088	she	244	" I 'll go and see if she has a headache . You must consult with us , William ; you know the mother so well . "
29119	29127	29129	29129	Ashe	219	" Oh , I 'm no good ! "
29134	29147	29129	29129	Ashe	219	" But I 'm sure that kindness would pay with Lady Kitty . "
29164	29174	29175	29175	she	244	" I hope we are always kind to her , "
29198	29200	29236	29237	Lady Grosville	244	" Kindness "
29654	29677	29648	29648	he	1378	" You must have followed these matters for years . Why have you never spoken in the House , or written anything ? "
29685	29693	29694	29694	he	1378	" What would have been the good ? "
29702	29725	29694	29694	he	1378	" The fellows who did n't know would n't have believed me ; and the fellows who knew did n't want telling . "
29736	29740	29741	29741	he	1378	" I thought , "
29744	29751	29741	29741	he	1378	" ours was government by discussion . "
29773	29810	29762	29762	he	1378	" Or government by country - houses -- which ? If you support us in this -- as I gather you will -- this walk will have been worth a debate -- now wo n't it ? "
29831	29837	29838	29838	he	1378	" Geoffrey Cliffe 's arrived , "

30888	30916	30823	30823	Kitty	256	" To the men , of course ! If we did n't like clothes , if we did n't like being admired -- where would you be ? "
30917	30925	30927	30927	Cliffe	323	" Personally , I could get on , "
30929	30941	30927	30927	Cliffe	323	" You expect us to be too much on our knees . "
30942	30958	30960	30960	Kitty	256	" As if we should ever get you there if it did n't amuse you ! "
30962	30992	30960	30960	Kitty	256	" Hypocrites ! If we do n't dress , paint , chatter , and tell lies for you , you wo n't look at us -- and if we do-- "
30993	31007	31010	31010	Cliffe	323	" Of course , it all depends on how well it 's done , "
31015	31057	31012	31012	Kitty	256	" That 's judging by results . I look to the motive . I repeat , if I powder and paint , it 's not because I 'm vain , but because it 's my painful duty to give you pleasure . "
31058	31068	31069	31069	She	256	" And if it does n't give me pleasure ? "
31074	31091	31069	31069	She	256	" Call me stupid then -- not vain . I ought to have done it better . "

31677	31712	31675	31675	Harman	242	" At the present moment she and Cliffe seem to be discussing the ' Dame aux Camélias . ' Since when do they take young girls to see that kind of thing in Paris ? "

33591	33600	33611	33611	He	323	" It is not in the least better ! "
33601	33610	33574	33574	Ashe	219	" Then you disguise it like a heroine . "
33895	33914	33916	33916	Ashe	219	" Yet even when he wants a thing he ca n't behave himself in order to get it , "
33918	33953	33916	33916	Ashe	219	" Anybody else would have turned Sabbatarian for once , and refrained from flirting with the Grosvilles ' niece . But that 's Cliffe all over -- and perhaps the best thing about him . "

34416	34419	34421	34421	Ashe	219	" Good ! "
34423	34441	34395	34395	Mary	223	" The servants were , of course , playing cards in the house - keeper 's room . "
34442	34455	34395	34395	Mary	223	" Not at all . They were singing hymns with Lady Grosville . "
34460	34481	34395	34395	Mary	223	" Only the slaveys and scullery maids that could n't help themselves . Never mind . Was Lady Kitty amenable ? "
34482	34501	34395	34395	Mary	223	" She seems to have made Lord Grosville very angry . Lady Grosville and I smoothed him down . "
34502	34506	34508	34508	Ashe	219	" Did you ? "
34510	34517	34508	34508	Ashe	219	" That was nice of you . "
34532	34544	34395	34395	Mary	223	" Are n't you as sorry for her as I am ? "
34545	34561	34604	34604	he	219	" For Lady Kitty ? I should think she managed to amuse herself pretty well . "
34562	34574	34576	34576	Ashe	219	" She seems to me the most deplorable tragic little person , "
34584	34592	34593	34593	she	225	" I really do n't see it , "
34596	34603	34604	34604	he	219	" Oh yes , you do , "
34605	34619	34620	34620	She	225	persisted--"if you think a moment . Be kind to her -- won't you ? "
34629	34642	34622	34622	herself	225	" I confess that she has never attracted me in the least . "
35021	35028	35030	35030	Harman	242	" That was a curious spectacle , "
35032	35039	35030	35030	Harman	242	" Ashe 's equanimity was amazing . "
35040	35049	35051	35052	the Dean	987	" I had rather have seen him angrier , "
35056	35069	35030	35030	Harman	242	" He was always a very tolerant , easy - going fellow . "
35076	35091	35030	35030	Harman	242	" A touch of _ soeva indignatio _ now and then would complete him . "
35092	35100	35030	35030	Harman	242	" Has he got it in him ? "
35101	35105	35107	35109	the little Dean	1532	" Perhaps not , "
35123	35135	35107	35109	the little Dean	1532	" But without it he will hardly make a great man . "
35413	35417	35418	35418	he	987	" Lady Kitty , "
35428	35438	35418	35418	he	987	" have you forgotten you promised me some French ? "
35449	35463	35439	35439	Kitty	256	" Did I ? What shall I say ? Some Alfred de Musset ? "
35464	35467	35469	35470	the Dean	987	" No , "
35472	35477	35469	35470	the Dean	987	" I think not . "
35478	35481	35483	35483	her	256	" Some -- some"--she
35484	35488	35469	35470	the Dean	987	memory--"some Théophile Gautier ? "
35489	35495	35497	35498	the Dean	987	" No , certainly not ! "
35502	35514	35516	35516	Kitty	256	" Well , as I do n't know a word of him-- "
35518	35523	35525	35526	the Dean	987	" That was mischievous , "
35532	35538	35525	35526	the Dean	987	" Let me suggest Lamartine . "
35545	35552	35541	35541	her	256	" I never learned one line . "
35553	35561	35563	35564	the Dean	987	" Then some of the old fellows , "
35568	35587	35563	35564	the Dean	987	" I long to hear you in Corneille or Racine . That we should _ all _ enjoy . "
35652	35678	35646	35646	them	1556	" Poor child ! I understand . But be a _ little _ good -- as well as clever -- and all will be well . "
35711	35722	35723	35723	she	256	" I think I could say some ' Polyeucte , ' "
35736	35740	35741	35741	he	987	" Lady Grosville , "
35746	35787	35745	35745	his	987	voice--"Ladies and gentlemen , Lady Kitty has promised to say us some more French poetry . You remember how admirably she recited last night . But this is Sunday , and she will give us something in a different vein . "
35826	35902	35818	35819	the Dean	987	" Lady Kitty will recite a scene from Corneille 's beautiful tragedy of ' Polyeucte'--the scene in which Pauline , after witnessing the martyrdom of her husband , who has been beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to the gods , returns from the place of execution so melted by the love and sacrifice she has beheld that she opens her heart then and there to the same august faith and pleads for the same death . "
35955	35961	35962	35962	she	256	" May I have that ? "
35978	35984	35962	35962	she	256	" I am rather cold . "
35999	36002	36007	36007	his	252	" Actress ! "
36223	36233	36203	36204	Lady Edith	271	" How _ could _ you remember it all ? "
36243	36255	36286	36286	Ashe	219	" I had to say it every week at the convent . "
36256	36260	36262	36262	Cliffe	252	" I understand , "
36266	36279	36262	36262	Cliffe	252	ear--"that last night she was Doña Sol . An accommodating young woman . "
36293	36294	36290	36290	He	219	" Magnificent!"--but
36371	36386	36365	36366	Lord Grosville	265	" Upon my word , Kitty , you ought to go on the stage ! "
36473	36479	36480	36480	he	277	" My dear Miss Lyster , "
36491	36505	36480	36480	he	277	" did you ever hear anything better done ? A most remarkable talent ! "
36509	36514	36515	36515	she	223	" I am wondering , "
36518	36537	36515	36515	she	223	" what they teach you in French convents -- and why ! It is all so singular,--isn't it ? "
37202	37210	37211	37211	he	219	" She may scandalize half the world , "
37216	37221	37211	37211	he	219	stubbornly--"I shall understand her ! "
37576	37583	37567	37567	he	219	" knowing more than the other fellows "
37651	37659	37604	37604	family	1608	" the violent take it by force . "
37782	37785	37786	37786	he	219	" Madcap ! "
37927	37934	37935	37935	she	256	" Did n't I throw straight ? "
37940	37949	37935	37935	she	256	" And they say girls ca n't throw . "
37950	37959	37960	37960	he	219	" But why did you throw at all ? "
37967	37998	38000	38000	her	256	" Because I wanted to talk to you . And I was restless and could n't sleep . Why did you never come and talk to me this afternoon ? And why"--she
38002	38015	38000	38000	her	256	angrily--"did you let me go and play billiards alone with Mr. Cliffe ? "
38016	38020	38022	38022	Ashe	219	" Let you ! "
38024	38033	38022	38022	Ashe	219	" As if anybody could have prevented you ! "
38034	38047	38000	38000	her	256	" One sees , of course , that you detest Mr. Cliffe , "
38054	38083	38022	38022	Ashe	219	" I did n't come here to talk about Geoffrey Cliffe . I _ wo n't _ talk about him ! Though , of course , you must know-- "
38084	38129	38000	38000	her	256	" That I flirted with him abominably all the afternoon ? _ C'est vrai -- c'est ab - sol - ument vrai ! _ And I shall always want to flirt with him , wherever I am -- and whatever I may be doing . "
38130	38136	38138	38138	Ashe	219	" Do as you please , "
38142	38151	38138	38138	Ashe	219	" but I think you will get tired . "
38152	38230	38000	38000	her	256	" No , no -- he excites me ! He is bad , false , selfish , but he excites me . He talks to very few women -- one can see that . And all the women want to talk to him . He used to admire Miss Lyster , and now he dislikes her . But she does n't dislike him . No ! she would marry him to - morrow if he asked her . "
38231	38237	38239	38239	Ashe	219	" You are very positive , "
38241	38253	38239	38239	Ashe	219	" Allow me to say that I entirely disagree with you . "
38254	38263	38000	38000	her	256	" You do n't know anything about her , "
38269	38277	38000	38000	her	256	" She is my cousin , mademoiselle . "
38278	38313	38000	38000	her	256	" What does that matter ? I know much more than you do , though I have only seen her two days . I know that -- well , I am afraid of her ! "
38314	38333	38000	38000	her	256	" Afraid of her ? Did you come out -- may I ask -- determined to talk nonsense ? "
38334	38355	38000	38000	her	256	" I came out -- never mind ! I _ am _ afraid of her . She hates me . I think"--he
38371	38371	38000	38000	her	256	"
38372	38380	38382	38382	Ashe	219	" No one shall do you harm , "
38388	38395	38384	38384	his	219	" if you will only trust yourself-- "
38400	38413	38396	38396	She	1621	" To you ? Oh ! you 'd soon throw it up . "
38414	38418	38419	38419	he	219	" Try me ! "
38425	38437	38419	38419	he	219	" Lady Kitty , I have something to say to you . "
38459	38469	38470	38470	he	219	" I have n't yet known you three weeks , "
38482	38525	38470	38470	he	219	" I do n't know what you will say -- whether you can put up with me . But I know my own mind -- I shall not change . I -- I love you . I ask you to marry me . "
38564	38577	38553	38553	He	219	" You -- you really and actually -- want to marry me ? "
38578	38589	38664	38664	She	1622	" I do , Kitty , with all my heart . "
38590	38600	38553	38553	He	219	" You remember about my mother -- about Alice ? "
38601	38612	38664	38664	She	1622	" I remember everything . We would face it together . "
38613	38627	38553	38553	He	219	" And -- you know what I told you about my bad temper ? "
38628	38663	38664	38664	She	1622	" Some nonsense , was n't it ? But I should be bored by the domestic dove . I want the hawk , Kitty , with its quick wings and its daring bright eyes . "
38672	38693	38664	38664	She	1622	" You must listen . I _ have_--a wicked , odious , ungovernable temper . I should make you miserable . "
38694	38699	38701	38701	Ashe	219	" Not at all , "
38703	38717	38701	38701	Ashe	219	" I should take it very calmly . I am made that way . "
38718	38753	38664	38664	She	1622	" And then -- I do n't know how to put it -- but I have fancies -- overpowering fancies -- and I must follow them . I have one now for Geoffrey Cliffe . "
38757	38765	38754	38754	Ashe	219	" Oh , that wo n't last . "
38766	38785	38787	38787	her	1622	" Then some other will come after it . And I ca n't help it . It is my head"--she
38789	38794	38754	38754	Ashe	219	lightly--"that seems on fire . "
38804	38816	38817	38817	She	1622	" But it is your heart -- you will give me . "
38831	38841	38842	38842	she	1622	" You are very rich , are n't you ? "
38850	38867	38817	38817	She	1622	" I am well off . I can give you all the pretty things you want . "
38868	38878	38896	38896	her	1622	" And some day you will be Lord Tranmore ? "
38879	38888	38889	38889	he	219	" Yes , when my poor father dies , "
38913	38935	38896	38896	her	1622	" And every one says you are so clever -- you have such prospects . Perhaps you will be Prime Minister . "
38936	38944	38945	38945	he	219	" Well , there 's no saying , "
38949	38956	38945	38945	he	219	laughing--"if you 'll come and help . "
38962	39001	38896	38896	her	1622	" Help ! I should be the ruin of you . I should spoil everything . You do n't know the mischief I can do . And I ca n't help it , it 's in my blood . "
39002	39018	39019	39019	His	219	" You would like the game of politics too much to spoil it , Kitty . "
39028	39042	39019	39019	His	219	" You would want to be a great lady and lead the party . "
39043	39056	38896	38896	her	1622	" Should I ? Could you ever teach me how to behave ? "
39057	39075	39019	39019	His	219	" You would learn by nature . Do you know , Kitty , how clever you are ? "
39076	39079	39080	39080	she	1624	" Yes , "
39083	39100	39080	39080	she	1624	" I am clever . But there is always something that hinders -- that brings failure . "
39101	39107	39108	39108	he	219	" How old are you ? "
39113	39119	39108	39108	he	219	" Eighteen -- or eighty ? "
39154	39203	39204	39204	Their	1626	" Oh ! I knew -- I knew -- when I first saw your face . I had been so miserable all day -- and then you looked at me -- and I wanted to tell you all . Oh , I adore you -- I adore you ! "
39280	39291	39266	39266	she	1631	" Oh ! what -- what will Lady Tranmore say ? "
39336	39344	39396	39399	Lady Kitty 's maid	1633	" The world an ancient murderer is . "
39346	39393	39396	39399	Lady Kitty 's maid	1633	" Her ladyship will be in before six , my lady . I was to be sure and ask you to wait , if you came before , and to tell you that her ladyship had gone to Madame Fanchette about her dress for the ball . "
39688	39691	39731	39731	She	256	" the gleam "
39934	39939	39940	39940	Kitty	256	" L'Embarquement pour Cythère . "
40025	40037	40038	40038	she	1658	" Her ladyship has been choosing her costume , my lady , "
40049	40054	40056	40057	Lady Tranmore	222	" Is it settled ? "
40175	40189	40191	40192	the maid	1634	" It really seemed to be the only one that suited her ladyship , "
40199	40209	40211	40212	Lady Tranmore	222	" I dare say it will look very well , "
40214	40222	40211	40212	Lady Tranmore	222	" And Fanchette is to make it ? "
40223	40232	40234	40235	the maid	1634	" If her ladyship is not too late , "
40239	40253	40234	40235	the maid	1634	" But she has taken such a long time to make up her mind-- "
40254	40278	40211	40212	Lady Tranmore	222	" And Fanchette , of course , is driven to death . All the world seems to have gone mad about this ball . "
40427	40443	40444	40444	she	222	" And Mr. Ashe -- do you know if he is going , after all ? "
40455	40471	40473	40474	the maid	1634	" Mr. Ashe says he will , if he may wear just court - dress , "
40478	40493	40473	40474	the maid	1634	" Not unless . And her ladyship 's afraid it wo n't be allowed . "
40494	40503	40505	40506	Lady Tranmore	222	" She 'll make him go in costume , "
40508	40523	40505	40506	Lady Tranmore	222	" And he will do it , or anything , to avoid a scene . "
40552	40560	40561	40561	she	222	" Where is the _ Times _ ? "
40588	40597	40599	40600	the visitor	1681	" Kitty has probably not looked at it , "
40693	40697	40699	40702	the _ Times _	1684	" Mr. Ashe , "
40704	40776	40699	40702	the _ Times _	1684	" has well earned the promotion he is now sure to receive before long . In those important rearrangements of some of the higher offices which can not be long delayed , Mr. Ashe is clearly marked out for a place in the cabinet . He is young , but he has already done admirable service ; and there can be no question that he has a great future before him . "
41297	41316	41317	41317	he	219	" You 'll help her , you 'll train her , you 'll put her in the way , "
41327	41358	41317	41317	he	219	" And you 'll see that in the end we shall both of us be so conceited to have had the making of her there 'll be no holding us . "
42303	42308	42309	42309	she	1731	" Ah , Margaret ! "
42378	42403	42345	42345	her	1738	" I came to see if I could do anything to - day for Kitty . I know she is very busy about the ball-- "
42404	42410	42412	42413	Lady Tranmore	222	" Head over ears apparently , "
42415	42430	42412	42413	Lady Tranmore	222	" Everybody has lost their wits . I see Kitty has chosen her dress . "
42431	42465	42345	42345	her	1738	" Yes , if Fanchette can make it all right . Poor Kitty ! She has been in such a state of mind . I think I 'll go on with these invitations . "
42523	42530	42531	42531	she	341	" I did about half yesterday , "
42534	42556	42531	42531	she	341	" but I see Kitty has n't been able to touch them , and it is really time they were out . "
42557	42564	42531	42531	she	341	" For their party next week ? "
42565	42584	42531	42531	she	341	" Yes . I hope Kitty wo n't tire herself out . It has been a rush lately . "
42585	42591	42531	42531	she	341	" Does she ever rest ? "
42592	42613	42531	42531	she	341	" Never -- as far as I can see . And I am afraid she has been very much worried . "
42614	42623	42625	42626	Lady Tranmore	222	" About that silly affair with Prince Stephan ? "
42632	42665	42628	42629	Margaret French	341	" She vows that she meant no harm , and did no harm , and that it has been all malice and exaggeration . But one can see she has been hurt . "
42666	42674	42676	42677	Lady Tranmore	222	" Well , if you ask me , "
42684	42692	42676	42677	Lady Tranmore	222	" I think she deserved to be . "
43550	43565	43567	43568	Lady Tranmore	222	" I am afraid this has made things worse than ever with the Parhams , "
43578	43591	43567	43568	Lady Tranmore	222	" I hope Kitty wo n't throw over their dinner next week . "
43592	43599	43567	43568	Lady Tranmore	222	" She is talking of it ! "
43600	43610	43612	43612	Margaret	341	" Yesterday she had almost made up her mind , "
43616	43640	43612	43612	Margaret	341	" Perhaps you will persuade her . But she has been terribly angry with Lord Parham -- and with Lady P. , too . "
43641	43661	43663	43664	Lady Tranmore	222	" And it was to be a reconciliation dinner , after the old nonsense between her and Lady Parham , "
43666	43726	43663	43664	Lady Tranmore	222	" It was planned for Kitty entirely . And she is to act something , is n't she , with that young De La Rivière from the embassy ? I believe the Princess is coming -- expressly to meet her . I have been hearing of it on all sides . She _ ca n't _ throw it over ! "
43732	43738	43727	43727	Margaret	341	" I believe she will . "
43751	43760	43761	43761	she	341	" William must really put his foot down , "
43771	43783	43761	43761	she	341	" It is , of course , most important -- just now-- "
43800	43805	43807	43807	Margaret	341	" Let 's hope , "
43809	43826	43807	43807	Margaret	341	" that Mr. Ashe will be able to pacify her . Ah , there she is . "
43907	43918	43919	43919	she	341	" Why , they never told me down - stairs ! "
43937	43945	43919	43919	she	341	" Have I lost much of you ? "
43946	43955	43957	43958	Lady Tranmore	222	" Well , I must soon be off , "
43960	43967	43957	43958	Lady Tranmore	222	" Harry has been entertaining me . "
43968	43977	43979	43979	Kitty	243	" Oh , Harry ; is he there ? "
44060	44063	44065	44065	Kitty	243	" Come ! "
44120	44129	44131	44131	Margaret	341	" Shall I take him up - stairs ? "
44133	44145	44147	44148	Lady Tranmore	222	" Why , he seems to have only just come down ! "
44150	44155	44147	44148	Lady Tranmore	222	" Must he go ? "
44156	44164	44166	44166	Kitty	243	" He can come down again afterwards , "
44168	44181	44166	44166	Kitty	243	" I want to talk to you . Take him , Margaret . "
44197	44203	44205	44206	Lady Tranmore	222	" He looks rather frail , "
44208	44223	44205	44206	Lady Tranmore	222	" I hope you 'll soon be sending him to the country , Kitty . "
44224	44230	44232	44232	Kitty	243	" He 's very well , "
44250	44297	44298	44298	She	243	" Heavens , I had forgotten all about them ! What an angel is Margaret ! I really ca n't remember these things . They ought to do themselves by clock - work . And now Fanchette and this ball are enough to drive one wild . "
44325	44332	44298	44298	She	243	" Fanchette can make your dress ? "
44333	44378	44298	44298	She	243	" She says she will , but I could n't make her understand anything I wanted . She is off her head ! They all are . By - the - way , did you hear of Madeleine Alcot 's . telegram to Worth ? "
44379	44382	44298	44298	She	243	" No . "
44417	44419	44413	44413	They	1786	" Kitty "
44421	44424	44413	44413	They	1786	" Madeleine , "
44454	44511	44408	44408	rival	1785	" She telegraphed to Worth as soon as her invitation arrived , ' Envoyez tout de suite costume Vénus . Réponse . ' The answer came at dinner -- she had a dinner - party -- and she read it aloud : ' Remercîments . Il n'y en a pas . ' Is n't it delightful ? "
44512	44516	44518	44519	Lady Tranmore	222	" Very neat , "
44523	44540	44518	44519	Lady Tranmore	222	" When did you invent that ? You , I hear , are to be Diana ? "
44548	44592	44408	44408	rival	1785	" Ask Fanchette -- it depends on her . There is no one but she in London who can do it . Oh , by - the - way , what 's Mary going to be ? I suppose a Madonna of sorts . "
44593	44598	44600	44601	Lady Tranmore	222	" Not at all , "
44605	44618	44600	44601	Lady Tranmore	222	" she has chosen a Sir Joshua costume I found for her . "
44619	44624	44626	44626	Kitty	243	" A vocation missed , "
44632	44660	44629	44629	her	243	" She ought to have been a ' Vestal Virgin ' at least .... Do you know that you look _ such _ a duck this afternoon ! "
44697	44720	44661	44662	The speaker	623	" This hat suits you so -- you are such a _ grande dame _ in it . Ah ! Je t'adore ! "
44751	44760	44762	44763	Elizabeth Tranmore	365	" Do n't be a goose , Kitty . "
44775	44790	44762	44763	Elizabeth Tranmore	365	" Now tell me what you 're going to wear at the Parhams ' . "
44803	44812	44762	44763	Elizabeth Tranmore	365	" It must be quite time for tea . "
44813	44823	44762	44763	Elizabeth Tranmore	365	" You have n't answered my question , Kitty . "
44824	44829	44830	44831	The butler	634	" Have n't I ? "
44834	44844	44830	44831	The butler	634	" Tea , please , Wilson , at once . "
44845	44847	44762	44763	Elizabeth Tranmore	365	" Kitty!-- "
44871	44881	44830	44831	The butler	634	" I am not going to the Parhams ' . "
44882	44888	44830	44831	The butler	634	" Kitty!--what do you mean ? "
44889	44899	44901	44901	Kitty	243	" I am not going to the Parhams ' , "
44905	44928	44901	44901	Kitty	243	" They should behave a little more considerately to me if they want to get me to amuse their guests for them . "
44951	44957	44959	44959	Kitty	243	" Oh , Margaret knows , "
44961	44967	44959	44959	Kitty	243	" I told her yesterday . "
44968	44972	44974	44974	Margaret	341	" The Parhams ? "
45017	45092	45002	45003	Lady Tranmore	222	" I do n't know how you 're going to get out of it , my dear . Lady Parham has asked the Princess , first because she wished to come , secondly as an olive - branch to you . She has taken the greatest pains about the dinner ; and afterwards there is to be an evening party to hear you , just the right size , and just the right people . "
45093	45098	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" Cela m'est égal , "
45102	45115	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" par - faite - ment égal ! I am not going . "
45116	45124	45002	45003	Lady Tranmore	222	" What possible excuse can you invent ? "
45125	45164	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" I shall have a cold , the most atrocious cold imaginable . I take to my bed just two hours before it is time to dress . My letter reaches Lady Parham on the stroke of eight . "
45165	45184	45002	45003	Lady Tranmore	222	" Kitty , you would be doing a thing perfectly unheard of -- most rude -- most unkind ! "
45211	45228	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" I should for once be paying off a score that has run on too long . "
45229	45246	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" You and Lady Parham had agreed to make friends , and let bygones be bygones . "
45247	45254	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" That was before last week . "
45255	45265	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" Before Lord Parham said -- what annoyed you ? "
45271	45284	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" Before Lord Parham humiliated me in public -- or tried to . "
45285	45329	45100	45100	Kitty	243	" Dear Kitty , he was annoyed , and said a sharp thing ; but he is an old man , and for William 's sake , surely , you can forgive it . And Lady Parham had nothing to do with it . "
45330	45340	45342	45342	Kitty	243	" She has not written to me to apologize , "
45350	45403	45404	45404	Kitty	243	" Do n't talk about it , mother . It will hurt you , and I am determined . Lady Parham has patronized or snubbed me ever since I married -- when she has n't been setting my best friends against me . She is false , false , _ false _ ! "
45414	45441	45404	45404	Kitty	243	" And Lord Parham said a thing to me last week I shall never forgive . Voilà ! Now I mean to have done with it ! "
45442	45508	45404	45404	Kitty	243	" And you choose to forget altogether that Lord Parham is William 's political chief -- that William 's affairs are in a critical state , and everything depends on Lord Parham -- that it is not seemly , not possible , that William 's wife should publicly slight Lady Parham , and through her the Prime Minister -- at this moment of all moments . "
45514	45526	45528	45528	Kitty	243	" William will not expect me to put up with insults , "
45536	45562	45404	45404	Kitty	243	" But ca n't you see that -- just now especially -- you ought to think of nothing--_nothing_--but William 's future and William 's career ? "
45563	45574	45584	45585	Lady Tranmore	222	" William will never purchase his career at my expense . "
45575	45582	45584	45585	Lady Tranmore	222	" Kitty , dear , listen , "
45771	45774	45776	45777	his mother	630	" William ! "
45783	45816	45776	45777	his mother	630	" do n't go . Kitty and I were disputing ; but it is nothing , dear ! Do n't go , you look so tired . Can you stay for dinner ? "
45817	45825	45827	45827	Ashe	243	" Well , that was my intention , "
45842	45850	45827	45827	Ashe	243	" But Kitty seems in the clouds . "
45901	45917	45892	45893	Lady Tranmore	222	" We wo n't talk any more about it now , Kitty , will we ? "
45929	45935	45918	45918	Kitty	243	" Perhaps William had better understand-- "
45936	45939	45941	45941	Ashe	243	" Goodness ! "
45943	45999	45941	45941	Ashe	243	" Is it the Parhams ? Send them , Kitty , if you please , to ten thousand _ diables _ ! You wo n't go to their dinner ? Well , do n't go ! Please yourself -- and hang the expense ! Come and give me some dinner -- there 's a dear . "
46089	46107	46075	46076	his wife	914	" I have told your mother , William , what I intend to do about the Parhams . "
46108	46118	46065	46065	Ashe	243	" Very well , dear . Now she knows . "
46119	46128	46075	46076	his wife	914	" She says it will ruin your career . "
46129	46173	46065	46065	Ashe	243	" Did she ? We 'll talk about that presently . We have had a nasty scene in the House with the Irishmen , and I 'm famished . Go and change , there 's a dear . Dinner 's just coming in . "
46280	46296	46261	46261	she	243	" William , I ca n't go to that dinner -- it would kill me ! "
46297	46305	46306	46306	he	1807	" How you repeat yourself , darling ! "
46313	46338	46306	46306	he	1807	" I suppose you 'll give Lady Parham decent notice . What 'll you do ? Get a doctor 's certificate and go away ? "
46342	46357	46339	46339	Kitty	243	" Not at all . I shall not tell her till an hour before . "
46361	46382	46358	46358	Ashe	243	" War ? I see . Open war . Very well . Then we shall get to Venice for Easter . "
46387	46393	46358	46358	Ashe	243	" What do you mean ? "
46394	46425	46358	46358	Ashe	243	" Very plain , is n't it ? But what does it matter ? Venice will be delightful , and there are plenty of good men to take my place . "
46426	46434	46358	46358	Ashe	243	" Lord Parham would pass you over ? "
46435	46478	46358	46358	Ashe	243	" Not at all . But I ca n't work in public with a man whom I must cut in private . It would n't amuse me . So if you 're decided , Kitty , write to Danieli 's for rooms . "
46609	46617	46618	46618	he	1811	" Kitty , what are you about ? "
47530	47532	47541	47541	her	223	" Polly "
47909	47919	47921	47921	Mary	223	" I hear Kitty is furious with the Parhams , "
47959	47970	47971	47971	she	222	" I do n't know where it is to end , "
47976	47989	47955	47955	her	222	" Lady Parham told me yesterday -- you do n't mind my repeating it?"--Mary
47994	48017	47955	47955	her	222	smile--"she was still dreadfully afraid that Kitty would play her some trick about next Friday . She knows that Kitty detests her . "
48018	48022	48024	48025	Lady Tranmore	222	" Oh no , "
48032	48038	48024	48025	Lady Tranmore	222	" Kitty couldn't -- impossible ! "
48062	48074	48075	48075	she	223	" And it 's all so awkward , is n't it ? "
48081	48095	48075	48075	she	223	" when apparently Lady Parham is as much Prime Minister as he is . "
48391	48414	48416	48416	Ashe	219	" It will be so perfectly easy when the moment comes to invent some excuse or other for shelving William 's claims , "
48420	48441	48416	48416	Ashe	219	" Nobody is indispensable , and if that old woman is provoked , she will be capable of any mischief . "
48442	48450	48452	48452	Mary	223	" What do you want for William ? "
48456	48469	48471	48472	Lady Tranmore	222	" He ought , of course , to have the Home Office ! "
48486	48506	48477	48477	Mary	223	" Kitty is so clever , she will understand how important discretion is , before things go too far . "
48526	48532	48533	48533	she	225	" Has William ever interfered ? "
48542	48549	48550	48550	she	222	" Not that I know of , "
48556	48573	48550	48550	she	222	" Nor will he ever -- in the sense in which any ordinary husband would interfere . "
48574	48650	48520	48521	Miss Lyster	225	" I know ! It is as though he had a kind of superstition about it . Is n't there a fairy story , in which an elf marries a mortal on condition that if he ever ill - treats her , her people will fetch her back to fairyland ? One day the husband lost his temper and spoke crossly ; instantly there was a crash of thunder and the elf - wife vanished . "
48651	48706	48712	48713	Lady Tranmore	222	" I do n't remember the story . But it 's like that -- exactly . He said to me once that he would never have asked her to marry him if he had not been able to make up his mind to let her have her own way -- never to coerce her . "
48789	48796	48797	48797	she	222	" She is really very handsome , "
48798	48819	48797	48797	she	222	thought--"much better - looking than she was at twenty . What are the men about , not to marry her ? "
49136	49145	49160	49161	Lady Tranmore	222	" Interview with Mr. Cliffe . Peace assured . "
49153	49159	49160	49161	Lady Tranmore	222	" Geoffrey Cliffe home again ! "
49171	49186	49160	49161	Lady Tranmore	222	" We shall have to get on without our daily telegram . Poor London ! "
49214	49228	49230	49231	Miss Lyster	225	" He has had a great success , though , with his telegrams ! "
49233	49244	49230	49231	Miss Lyster	225	" I should have thought one could n't deny that . "
49245	49257	49259	49260	Lady Tranmore	222	" Success ! Only with the people who do n't matter , "
49266	49291	49259	49260	Lady Tranmore	222	" Of what importance is it to anybody that Geoffrey Cliffe should telegraph his doings and his opinions every morning to the English public ? "
49502	49506	49508	49508	her	1911	" Geoffrey Cliffe , "
49517	49551	49508	49508	her	1911	" ' The President and I met this morning'--'The President considers , and I agree with him'--'I told the President'--etc.--'The President this morning signed and sealed a memorable despatch . He said to me afterwards'"--etc
49652	49664	49672	49672	her	222	" How could a man make such a fool of himself ! "
49698	49705	49707	49707	Mary	223	" Well , we shall see , "
49713	49742	49707	49707	Mary	223	" I do n't quite agree with you , Cousin Elizabeth -- indeed , I know there are many people who think that he has certainly done good . "
49818	49821	49822	49822	she	223	" Good ! "
49823	49835	49872	49873	Lady Tranmore	222	echoed--"_good_?--with that boasting , and that _ fanfaronnade _ . Polly ! "
49843	49871	49822	49822	she	223	" We must allow everybody their own ways of doing things , must n't we ? I am quite sure he has meant well -- all through . "
49878	49901	49875	49875	her	222	" Lord Parham told me he had had the most grotesque letters from him!--and meant henceforward to put them in the fire . "
49902	49909	49911	49911	Mary	223	" Very foolish of Lord Parham , "
49915	49949	49911	49911	Mary	223	" I should have thought that a Prime Minister would welcome information -- from all sides . And of course Mr. Cliffe thinks that the government has been _ very _ badly served . "
49957	49970	49950	49951	Lady Tranmore	222	" You do n't mean -- that -- you hear from him ? "
49994	50037	50038	50039	The speaker	623	" Yes , dear Cousin Elizabeth . I have heard from him regularly for the last six months . I have often wished to tell you , but I was afraid you might misunderstand me , and -- my courage failed me ! "
50051	50099	50044	50044	her	623	" The fact is , he wrote to me last autumn from Japan . You remember that poor cousin of mine who died at Tokio ? Mr. Cliffe had seen something of him , and he very kindly wrote both to his mother and me afterwards . Then-- "
50100	50107	50109	50110	Lady Tranmore	222	" You did n't forgive him ! "
50115	50141	50044	50044	her	623	" Was there anything to forgive ? We were both young and foolish . Anyway , he interests me -- and his letters are splendid . "
50142	50154	50044	50044	her	623	" Did you ever tell William you were corresponding with him ? "
50155	50206	50044	50044	her	623	" No , indeed ! But I want very much to make them understand each other better . Why should n't the government make use of him ? He does n't wish at all to be thrown into the arms of the other side . But they treat him so badly-- "
50207	50225	50044	50044	her	623	" My dear Mary ! are we governed by the proper people , or are we not ? "
50226	50235	50237	50237	Mary	223	" It is no good ignoring the press , "
50244	50253	50237	50237	Mary	223	" And the Bishop quite agrees with me . "
50262	50270	50254	50255	Lady Tranmore	222	" You discussed it with the Bishop ? "
50320	50331	50333	50333	Mary	223	" I read him some of Mr. Cliffe 's letters , "
50337	50344	50333	50333	Mary	223	" He thought them most remarkable . "
50345	50353	50379	50380	Lady Tranmore	222	" Even when he mocks at missionaries ? "
50354	50378	50333	50333	Mary	223	" Oh ! but he does n't mock at them any more . He has learned wisdom -- I assure you he has ! "
50411	50420	50379	50380	Lady Tranmore	222	" And you knew he was coming home ? "
50421	50425	50427	50427	Mary	223	" Oh yes ! "
50429	50467	50427	50427	Mary	223	" I meant to have told you at dinner . But something put it out of my head -- Kitty , of course ! I should n't wonder if he were at the embassy to - night . "
50468	50472	50473	50473	Tranmore	222	" Polly ! tell me--"--Lady
50481	50488	50473	50473	Tranmore	222	force--"are you going to marry him ? "
50489	50496	50427	50427	Mary	223	" Not that I know of , "
50502	50519	50427	50427	Mary	223	" Do n't you think I 'm old enough by now to have a man friend ? "
50520	50531	50473	50473	Tranmore	222	" And you expect me to be civil to him ! "
50532	50551	50427	50427	Mary	223	" Well , dear Cousin Elizabeth -- you know -- you never did break with him , quite . "
50587	50599	50579	50579	she	222	" I ca n't forget that William disapproves of him strongly . "
50600	50614	50616	50616	Mary	223	" Oh no -- excuse me -- I do n't think he does ! "
50620	50691	50616	50616	Mary	223	" He said to me , the other day , that he should be very glad to pick his brains when he came home . And then he laughed and said he was a ' deuced clever fellow'--excuse the adjective -- and it was a great thing to be ' as free as that chap was'--'without all sorts of boring colleagues and responsibilities . ' Was n't it like William ? "
50696	50704	50692	50693	Lady Tranmore	222	" William should n't say those things . "
50705	50747	50579	50579	she	222	" Of course , dear , he was only in fun . But I 'll lay you a small wager , Cousin Elizabeth , that Kitty will ask Mr. Cliffe to lunch as soon as she knows he is in town . "
50753	50778	50692	50693	Lady Tranmore	222	" I dare say . No one can answer for what Kitty will do . But Geoffrey Cliffe has said scandalous things of William . "
50779	50787	50789	50789	Mary	223	" He wo n't say them again , "
50793	50807	50789	50789	Mary	223	" Besides , William never minds being abused a bit -- does he ? "
50808	50813	50815	50816	Lady Tranmore	222	" He should mind , "
50822	50923	50815	50816	Lady Tranmore	222	" In my young days , our enemies were our enemies and our friends our friends . Nowadays nothing seems to matter . You may call a man a scoundrel one day and ask him to dinner the next . We seem to use words in a new sense -- and I confess I do n't like the change . Well , Mary , I sha'n't , of course , be rude to any friend of yours . But do n't expect me to be effusive . And please remember that my acquaintance with Geoffrey Cliffe is older than yours . "
51017	51023	51008	51008	her	223	" Will he be here ? "
51174	51184	51186	51186	Mary	223	" I do n't see either William or Kitty , "
51205	51223	51186	51186	Mary	223	" No . I suppose William was kept , and Kitty did not care to come alone . "
51286	51292	51311	51312	Lady Parham	360	" Lady Kitty not arrived ? "
51528	51563	51524	51525	Lady Parham	360	" Well , she must n't be tired the night of my party next week -- or the skies will fall . I never took so much trouble before about anything in my life . "
51564	51572	51574	51575	Lady Tranmore	222	" No , she must take care , "
51577	51591	51574	51575	Lady Tranmore	222	" Unfortunately , she is not strong , and she does too much . "
51600	51675	51592	51593	Lady Parham	360	" Not strong ? I should have thought Lady Kitty was made on wires . Well , if she fails me , I shall go to bed -- with small - pox . There will be nothing else to be done . The Princess has actually put off another engagement to come -- she has heard so much of Lady Kitty 's reciting . But you 'll help me through , wo n't you ? "
51733	51755	51714	51717	the owner of it	1943	mind--"I shall _ not _ go to Lady Parham 's ! My note will reach her on the stroke of eight . "
51756	51767	51768	51768	she	222	" Certainly -- I will keep an eye on her ! "
51773	51781	51768	51768	she	222	" But you know -- since her illness-- "
51782	51786	51788	51789	Lady Parham	360	" Oh no ! "
51793	51849	51788	51789	Lady Parham	360	" she is very well -- very well indeed . I never saw her look so radiant . By - the - way , did you hear your son 's speech the other night ? I did not see you in the gallery . A great pity if you missed it . It was admirable . "
51878	51887	51889	51890	Lady Parham	360	" Oh , he knows he did well , "
51894	51932	51889	51890	Lady Parham	360	" They all do . Lord Parham was delighted . He could do nothing but talk about it at dinner . He says they were in a very tight place , and Mr. Ashe got them out . "
51990	51994	51996	51997	Lady Parham	360	" Good Heavens ! "
51999	52011	51996	51997	Lady Parham	360	" Do you see who that is talking to Mr. Loraine ? "
52041	52072	52032	52033	The lady	1753	" If Mr. Cliffe thinks he has done himself any good by these ridiculous telegrams of his , he will find himself mistaken ! People are perfectly furious about them . "
52073	52076	52078	52079	Lady Tranmore	222	" Naturally , "
52081	52093	52078	52079	Lady Tranmore	222	" Only that it is a pity to take him seriously . "
52094	52144	52147	52147	herself	222	" Oh , I do n't know . He has his following ; unfortunately , some of our own men are inclined to think that Parham should conciliate him . Ignore him , I say . Behave as though he did n't exist . Ah ! by - the - way"--the
52157	52171	52147	52147	herself	222	undertone--"is it true that he may possibly marry your cousin , Miss Lyster ? "
52179	52193	52172	52173	Lady Tranmore	222	" Is it true that Lord Parham may possibly give him an appointment ? "
52201	52211	52194	52195	Lady Parham	360	" Is that one of the inventions going about ? "
52212	52218	52220	52221	Lady Tranmore	222	" There are so many , "
52364	52369	52371	52372	Lady Parham	360	" Look at them ! "
52385	52462	52371	52372	Lady Parham	360	" We shall have all this out in the House to - morrow . The Opposition mean to play that man for all he 's worth . Mr. Loraine , too -- with his puritanical ways ! I know what he thinks of Cliffe . He would n't _ touch _ him in private . But in public -- you'll see -- he'll swallow him whole -- just to annoy Parham . There 's your politician . "
52471	52474	52470	52472	the " ins	6002	" ins , "
52480	52483	52484	52485	Lady Parham	360	" outs , "
52940	52949	52901	52901	Her	222	" You think they 'll last till Whitsuntide ? "
52950	52954	52955	52955	she	222	" The government ? "
52960	52966	52955	52955	she	222	" Certainly -- and beyond . "
52967	52974	52976	52976	Cliffe	252	" I give them three weeks , "
52996	53014	52976	52976	Cliffe	252	" There will be some papers out to - morrow that will be a bomb - shell . "
53015	53043	53044	53044	His	252	" About America ? Oh , they have been blown up so often ! You , for instance , have been doing your best -- for months . "
53055	53067	53044	53044	His	252	" Well -- I wish I could make William hear reason . "
53109	53121	53122	53122	she	222	" Probably what is reason to you is folly to him , "
53127	53135	53137	53137	Cliffe	252	" No , no!--he _ knows _ , "
53142	53159	53160	53160	He	252	" The others do n't . Parham is more impossible -- more crassly , grossly ignorant ! "
53168	53180	53160	53160	He	252	" But Ashe , of course , is another matter altogether . "
53181	53195	53197	53198	Lady Tranmore	222	" Well , go and see him -- go and talk to him ! "
53203	53212	53197	53198	Lady Tranmore	222	" There are no lions in the way . "
53213	53216	53218	53218	Cliffe	252	" None , "
53220	53248	53218	53218	Cliffe	252	" As a matter of fact , Lady Kitty has asked me to luncheon . But does one find Ashe himself in the middle of the day ? "
53277	53281	53265	53265	Mary	223	" Not often . "
53287	53298	53265	53265	Mary	223	" But you could always find him at the House . "
53305	53313	53315	53315	Cliffe	252	" Is there a quiet corner anywhere ? "
53319	53328	53315	53315	Cliffe	252	" I have such heaps to tell you . "
53872	53891	53845	53845	Cliffe	252	" Will you excuse the remark ? There are no women who keep their first freshness like Englishwomen . "
53892	53917	53845	53845	Cliffe	252	" Thank you . If we feel fresh , I suppose we look it . As for you , you clearly want a rest . "
53918	53947	53845	53845	Cliffe	252	" No time to think of it , then ; I have come home to fight -- all I know ; to make myself as odious as possible . "
53951	53966	53948	53948	Mary	223	" You have been doing that so long . Why not try the opposite ? "
53973	53984	53967	53967	Cliffe	252	" You think I have made a failure of it ? "
53985	54010	53967	53967	Cliffe	252	" Not at all . You have made everybody furiously uncomfortable , and you see how civil even the Radical papers are to you . "
54011	54017	54019	54019	Cliffe	252	" Yes . What fools ! "
54023	54054	54019	54019	Cliffe	252	" They 'll soon leave that off . Just now I 'm a stick to beat the government with . But you do n't believe I shall carry my point ? "
54111	54122	54108	54108	Mary	223	" I think you will have to change your tactics . "
54123	54129	54130	54130	He	252	" Dictate them , then . "
54328	54337	54338	54338	he	252	" Well , all this is most illuminating , "
54343	54350	54338	54338	he	252	" I owe you immense thanks . "
54378	54389	54352	54352	he	252	" We 're very old friends , are n't we ? "
54390	54394	54396	54396	Mary	223	" Are we ? "
54401	54417	54418	54418	he	252	" So far as any one can be the friend of a chap like me , "
54423	54433	54418	54418	he	252	" Tell me , are you with Lady Tranmore ? "
54434	54451	54489	54489	he	252	" No . I go to her in a few days -- till I leave London . "
54452	54458	54459	54459	he	252	" Do n't go away , "
54466	54472	54459	54459	he	252	" Do n't go away . "
54498	54514	54489	54489	he	252	" By - the - way , they tell me Ashe is a great man . "
54528	54539	54515	54515	She	223	" They say he 'll be in the cabinet directly . "
54540	54564	54515	54515	She	223	" And Lady Kitty , I understand , is a scandal to gods and men , and the most fashionable person in town ? "
54565	54571	54573	54573	Mary	223	" Oh , not now , "
54575	54581	54573	54573	Mary	223	" That was last year . "
54582	54591	54515	54515	She	223	" You mean people are tired of her ? "
54592	54605	54573	54573	Mary	223	" Well , after a time , you know , a naughty child-- "
54606	54624	54515	54515	She	223	" Becomes a bore . Is she a bore ? I doubt ; I very much doubt . "
54625	54630	54632	54632	Mary	223	" Go and see , "
54634	54641	54632	54632	Mary	223	" When do you lunch there ? "
54642	54654	54515	54515	She	223	" I think to - morrow . Shall I find you ? "
54655	54669	54632	54632	Mary	223	" Oh no . I am not at all intimate with Lady Kitty . "
54833	54839	54841	54841	Darrell	246	" Was n't I expected ? "
54848	54858	54866	54866	he	2004	" Oh yes , sir -- yes , sir ! "
54875	54892	54866	54866	he	2004	" I believe her ladyship will be in directly . Will you kindly take a seat ? "
54944	54951	54952	54952	he	246	" I shall claim some lunch , "
54957	54972	54952	54952	he	246	" whatever happens . These young people want keeping in their place . Ah ! "
55037	55052	55053	55053	he	246	" Lady Kitty will make a stir in it -- no doubt of that ! "
55063	55095	55053	55053	he	246	" She has the keenest _ flair _ of them all for what produces an effect . None of the others can touch her -- Mrs. Alcot -- none of them ! "
55448	55452	55444	55445	Their foes	2036	" The Archangels , "
55534	55536	55533	55533	she	222	" harbored "
55703	55713	55715	55715	Darrell	246	" Well , we shall probably entertain each other , "
55722	55730	55715	55715	Darrell	246	" Lady Kitty often forgets her engagements . "
55731	55735	55737	55737	Cliffe	252	" Does she ? "
55891	55896	55898	55898	Cliffe	252	" In any case , "
55900	55917	55898	55898	Cliffe	252	" I suppose our friend here is sure of one or other of the big posts ? "
55918	55936	55937	55937	Darrell	246	" William Ashe ? Oh , I suppose so , unless some intrigue gets in the way . "
55942	55971	55939	55939	his	246	" Parham does n't , in truth , hit it off with him very well . Ashe is too clever , and Parham does n't understand his paradoxes . "
55972	55977	55979	55979	Cliffe	252	" Also I gather , "
55985	55993	55979	55979	Cliffe	252	" that Lady Parham has her say ? "
55999	56029	55939	55939	his	246	" It sounds incredible that one should still have to reckon with that kind of thing at this time of day . But I dare say it 's true . "
56030	56050	56053	56053	his	246	" However , I imagine Lady Kitty -- by - the - way , how much longer shall we give her?"--Cliffe
56057	56066	55939	55939	his	246	frown--"may be trusted to take care of that . "
56076	56087	56089	56089	Cliffe	252	" What , not a match for one Lady Parham ? "
56095	56117	56089	56089	Cliffe	252	" I should have thought -- from my old recollections of her -- she would have been a match for twenty ? "
56118	56127	56070	56070	his	246	" Oh , if she cared to try . "
56128	56134	56089	56089	Cliffe	252	" She is not ambitious ? "
56135	56146	56070	56070	his	246	" Certainly ; but not always for the same thing . "
56147	56158	56089	56089	Cliffe	252	" She is trying to run too many horses abreast ? "
56159	56169	56171	56171	Darrell	246	" Oh , I am not a great friend , "
56175	56185	56171	56171	Darrell	246	" I should never dream of analyzing Lady Kitty . Ah!"--he
56188	56199	56089	56089	Cliffe	252	head--"are we not forgotten , or just remembered -- which ? "
56378	56382	56383	56383	she	363	" Mr. Cliffe , "
56396	56407	56383	56383	she	363	" Kitty never told me . When did you come ? "
56408	56426	56383	56383	she	363	" I arrived a few days ago . Why were n't you at the embassy last night ? "
56427	56456	56457	56457	she	363	" Because I was much better employed . I have given up crushes . But I would have come -- to meet you . Ah , Mr. Darrell ! "
56470	56475	56457	56457	she	363	" Where is Kitty ? "
56481	56487	56489	56489	Darrell	246	" Shall we order lunch ? "
56503	56519	56521	56522	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Kitty is really too bad ; she is never less than an hour late , "
56527	56583	56584	56584	herself	363	" Last time she dined with us I asked her for seven - thirty . She thought something very special must be happening , and arrived -- breathless -- at half - past eight . Then she was furious with me because she was not the last . But one ca n't do it twice . Well"--addressing
56586	56593	56584	56584	herself	363	Cliffe--"are you come home to stay ? "
56594	56598	56600	56600	Cliffe	323	" That depends , "
56602	56612	56600	56600	Cliffe	323	" on whether England makes itself agreeable to me . "
56613	56627	56628	56628	she	363	" What are your deserts ? Why should England be agreeable to you ? "
56636	56645	56628	56628	she	363	" You do nothing but croak about England . "
56911	56920	56921	56921	he	277	" Is there no hope of Lady Kitty ? "
56927	56938	56900	56900	he	277	" Not much . Shall we go down to lunch ? "
56939	56944	56945	56946	The Dean	987	" Without our hostess ? "
56951	56958	56960	56961	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Oh , Kitty expects it , "
56967	56995	56960	56961	Mrs. Alcot	363	" and the servants are quite prepared . Kitty asks everybody to lunch -- then somebody asks her -- and she forgets . It 's quite simple . "
56996	56999	57001	57001	Cliffe	323	" Quite , "
57008	57019	57001	57001	Cliffe	323	" but I think I shall go to the club . "
57210	57224	57183	57183	Kitty	243	" You were going away ? I saw you take up your hat . "
57225	57232	57234	57234	Cliffe	323	" I despaired of my hostess , "
57267	57279	57260	57260	he	323	" and I was in no mood for second - best . "
57294	57320	57287	57287	she	243	" Ah , _ I _ remember -- at Grosville Park -- what a bad temper you had . You would have gone away furious . "
57321	57327	57329	57329	Cliffe	323	" With disappointment -- yes , "
57533	57541	57542	57542	she	243	" I have read all your telegrams , "
57545	57554	57542	57542	she	243	" Why did you attack William so fiercely ? "
57578	57592	57567	57567	her	243	" I attacked the official -- not the man . William knows that . "
57593	57610	57567	57567	her	243	" He is coming in to - day if possible . He wanted to see you . "
57611	57629	57567	57567	her	243	" Good news ! William knows that he would have hit just as hard in my place . "
57630	57638	57640	57640	Kitty	243	" I do n't think he would , "
57644	57650	57640	57640	Kitty	243	" He is so generous . "
57659	57695	57655	57655	Cliffe	323	" Well scored ! I wish I had a wife to play these strokes for me . I shall argue that a keen politician has no right to be generous . He is at war . "
57720	57733	57701	57701	She	243	" Where have you been -- all the time -- before America ? "
57734	57742	57744	57744	Cliffe	323	" In the deserts -- fighting devils , "
57750	57756	57757	57757	she	243	" What does that mean ? "
57762	57776	57701	57701	She	243	" Read my new book . That will tell you about the deserts . "
57777	57782	57701	57701	She	243	" And the devils ? "
57783	57792	57701	57701	She	243	" Ah , I keep them to myself . "
57793	57797	57798	57798	she	243	" Do you ? "
57803	57813	57798	57798	she	243	" I have just read your poems over again . "
57824	57847	57814	57814	Cliffe	323	" Have you ? But they were written three years ago . Dieu merci , one finds new devils like new acquaintances . "
57853	57859	57860	57860	he	323	" What do you mean ? "
57870	57877	57878	57878	she	243	" They are always the old , "
57937	57950	57954	57954	himself	323	" Does she mean me to understand that she is not happy ? "
58152	58157	58133	58133	they	1421	" Hullo , Ashe ! "
58159	58171	58133	58133	they	1421	" Hullo , Cliffe ! glad to see you back again , "
58185	58188	58192	58192	his	987	" phlegm , "
58328	58330	58318	58319	Lord S.	388	" fool "
58384	58391	58393	58393	Kitty	243	" That 's all very well , "
58404	58420	58393	58393	Kitty	243	" but he never told _ you _ how he proposed to the second Lady S. "
58447	58453	58455	58455	Ashe	243	" Go on , Kitty , "
58459	58463	58455	58455	Ashe	243	" go on . "
58473	58476	58467	58467	Kitty	243	" scenes , "
58497	58501	58496	58496	her	243	" parlor tricks , "
58595	58601	58602	58602	Ashe	243	" Well done , Kitty ! "
58619	58625	58628	58628	himself	323	" Does she love him ? "
58933	58938	58917	58917	He	987	" the newspaper fellow . "
58993	59000	59001	59001	she	243	" Not a word more politics ! "
59014	59028	59001	59001	she	243	" _ I _ want to talk to Mr. Cliffe about the ball . "
59097	59119	59079	59079	her	243	" You 're going , of course ? Lady M. told me the other day she _ must _ have you . "
59241	59253	59233	59233	Kitty	243	" I told my man to copy a portrait of Alva . "
59254	59261	59263	59263	Kitty	243	" Ah , that 's right , "
59265	59281	59263	59263	Kitty	243	nodding--"that 's right . Only it would have been better if it had been Torquemada . "
59328	59334	59335	59335	she	243	" Strength , I suppose , "
59351	59355	59356	59356	She	243	" And cruelty ? "
59359	59365	59383	59383	She	243	" Who are my victims ? "
59370	59382	59383	59383	She	243	" Whose tales have you been listening to , Lady Kitty ? "
59396	59409	59410	59410	he	323	" Ah , well , if you have been talking to her , "
59415	59429	59410	59410	he	323	" you may well expect to see me appear as Diabolus in person . "
59430	59455	59383	59383	She	243	" No . But it 's since then that I 've read the poems again . You see , you tell the public so much-- "
59456	59469	59470	59470	He	323	" That you think you have the right to guess the rest ? "
59479	59501	59470	59470	He	323	" Do n't guess , Lady Kitty . You have everything that life can give you . Let my secrets alone . "
59550	59568	59540	59540	his	323	" You heard -- and you believed -- that I tormented her -- that I killed her ? "
59585	59589	59572	59572	his	323	" Yes , but-- "
59590	59594	59572	59572	his	323	" But what ? "
59595	59603	59572	59572	his	323	" I did n't think it very strange-- "
59609	59635	59604	59604	Cliffe	323	" --that a man should be -- an inhuman beast -- if he were jealous -- and desperate . You can sympathize with these things ? "
59657	59666	59636	59636	She	243	" I do n't know anything about them . "
59667	59670	59671	59671	he	323	" Because , "
59674	59683	59671	59671	he	323	" your own life has been so happy ? "
59688	59722	59684	59684	She	243	" Do n't you think that jealousy will soon be as dead as -- saying your prayers and going to church ? I never meet anybody that cares enough -- to be jealous . "
59830	59846	59824	59824	Cliffe	323	" And yet you said you could understand?--such things did n't seem strange to you . "
59855	59914	59847	59847	She	243	" Did I ? It 's like the people who think they could act or sing , if they only had the chance . I choose to think I could feel . And of course I could n't . We 've lost the power . All the old , horrible , splendid things are dead and done with . "
59915	59923	59847	59847	She	243	" The old passions , you mean ? "
59924	59940	59847	59847	She	243	" And the old poems ! _ You 'll _ never write like that again . "
59941	59945	59947	59947	Cliffe	323	" God forbid ! "
59964	59986	59957	59957	he	323	" Lady Kitty , you 've thrown me a challenge that you hardly understand . Some day I must answer it . "
59987	59993	59995	59995	Kitty	243	" Do n't answer it , "
59999	60010	60011	60011	he	323	" Yes , if I can drag the words out , "
60147	60158	60160	60161	the Dean	987	" I hear you are an Archangel , Lady Kitty , "
60247	60251	60253	60253	Kitty	243	" Am I ? "
60289	60294	60275	60276	the Dean	987	" have become Mrs. Winston .
60295	60302	60304	60305	the Dean	987	" Well , you know best , "
60307	60325	60304	60305	the Dean	987	" But , at any rate , be good and explain to me what is an Archangel . "
60326	60336	60338	60338	Kitty	243	" Somebody whom most men and all women dislike , "
60342	60350	60352	60353	the Dean	987	" Yet they seem to be numerous , "
60355	60360	60362	60362	Kitty	243	" Not at all ! "
60370	60388	60362	60362	Kitty	243	" not at all ! If they were numerous they would , of course , be popular . "
60389	60406	60304	60305	the Dean	987	" And in fact they are rare -- and detested ? What other characteristics have they ? "
60407	60410	60412	60412	Kitty	243	" Courage , "
60417	60465	60304	60305	the Dean	987	" Courage to break rules ? I hear they all call one another by their Christian names , and live in one another 's rooms , and borrow one another 's money , and despise conventionalities . I am sorry you are an Archangel , Lady Kitty . "
60466	60475	60477	60477	Kitty	243	" I did n't admit that I was , "
60479	60490	60477	60477	Kitty	243	" but if I am , why are you sorry ? "
60491	60494	60496	60497	the Dean	987	" Because , "
60501	60512	60496	60497	the Dean	987	" I thought you were too clever to despise conventionalities . "
60574	60631	60568	60568	he	987	" Well , you know , we have heard all that before . My point of view is so much more interesting -- subtle -- romantic ! Anybody can attack Mrs. Grundy , but only a person of originality can adore her . Try it , Lady Kitty . It would be really worth your while . "
60637	60655	60657	60659	the old man	1012	" Do you know what that phrase -- that name of abomination -- always recalls to me ? "
60661	60670	60672	60672	Kitty	243	" It bores me , even to guess , "
60677	60708	60709	60710	The Dean	277	" Does it ? I think of some of the noblest people I have ever known -- brave men -- beautiful women -- who fought Mrs. Grundy , and perished . "
60785	60802	60803	60803	she	243	" '' Tis better to have fought and lost Than never to have fought at all-- ' "
60816	60819	60821	60822	the Dean	987	" Incorrigible ! "
60829	60841	60821	60822	the Dean	987	" I see ! Once an Archangel -- always an Archangel . "
60842	60846	60848	60848	Kitty	243	" Oh no ! "
60850	60860	60848	60848	Kitty	243	" There may be ' war in heaven . ' "
60861	60877	60883	60883	he	987	" Well , do n't take Mrs. Alcot for a leader , that 's all , "
60891	60897	60899	60899	Kitty	243	" And now I understand ! "
60903	60910	60899	60899	Kitty	243	" You detest my best friend . "
60967	60970	60971	60971	he	987	" Darling , "
60979	60995	60971	60971	he	987	" I must be off directly , but I should like to see the boy . "
61030	61040	61041	61041	he	987	" You are not a bad - looking pair , "
61052	61068	61041	61041	he	987	" But he 's rather pale , Kitty . I think he wants the country . "
61094	61102	61103	61103	he	987	" Dear , do n't be morbid ! "
61108	61125	61103	61103	he	987	" He will have so much brains that nobody will remember that . Think of Byron . "
61134	61159	61160	61160	she	243	" I remember so well when I first saw his foot -- after your mother told me -- and they brought him to me , "
61165	61174	61160	61160	she	243	" It seemed to me it was the end-- "
61175	61181	61257	61257	She	243	" The end of what ? "
61182	61187	61160	61160	she	243	" Of my dream . "
61188	61198	61257	61257	She	243	" What _ do _ you mean , Kitty ! "
61199	61225	61160	61160	she	243	" Do you remember the mask in the ' Tempest ' ? First Iris , with saffron wings , and rich Ceres , and great Juno-- "
61232	61256	61257	61257	She	243	" Then the nymphs and the reapers -- dancing together on ' the short - grassed green , ' the sweetest , gayest show-- "
61264	61268	61257	61257	She	243	" Then , suddenly-- "
61280	61303	61269	61269	She	243	" Prospero starts and speaks . And in a moment -- without warning -- with ' a strange , hollow , and confused noise'"--she
61307	61312	61269	61269	She	243	drearily--"_they heavily vanish _ . That"--she
61321	61329	61318	61319	the child	1023	foot--"was for me the sign of Prospero . "
61380	61390	61391	61391	she	243	" That first year I had been so happy , "
61399	61531	61391	61391	she	243	" Everything was so perfect , so glorious . Life was like a great pageant , in a palace . All the old terrors went . I often had fears as a child -- fears I could n't put into words , but that overshadowed me . Then when I saw Alice -- the shadow came nearer . But that was all gone . I thought God was reconciled to me , and would always be kind to me now . And then I saw that foot , and I knew that He hated me still . He had burned His mark into my baby 's flesh . And I was never to be quite happy again , but always in fear , fear of pain -- and death -- and grief-- "
61601	61683	61714	61714	his	2186	" that something like it had been for long moving obscurely below the surface of her life . He took the child and laid him on the floor , where he rolled at ease , cooing to himself . Then he came back to Kitty , and soothed her with extraordinary tenderness and skill . Presently she looked at him , as though some obscure trouble of which she had been the victim had released her , and she were herself again .
61684	61692	61693	61693	she	2185	" Do n't go away just yet , "
61728	61733	61736	61736	her	2185	" That is heavenly ! "
61748	61751	61752	61752	His	2186	" Kitty ! "
61763	61765	61766	61766	she	2185	" Heavenly-- "
61784	61798	61766	61766	she	2185	" because one _ yields_--_yields _ ! Life is such tension -- always . "
61907	61918	61897	61897	She	2185	" You must go back to the House , William . "
61919	61928	61897	61897	She	2185	" Yes , if you are all right . "
61946	61960	61962	61962	Ashe	219	" You have carried us both into such heights and depths , darling ! "
61974	61992	61965	61965	he	219	" that I have forgotten to tell you the gossip I brought back from mother this morning . "
62003	62022	61993	61993	Kitty	243	" Do you know that mother is convinced Mary Lyster has made up her mind to marry Cliffe ? "
62036	62047	62029	62029	Kitty	243	" He would never _ dream _ of marrying her ! "
62048	62067	62029	62029	Kitty	243	" Not so sure ! She has a great deal of money , and Cliffe wants money badly . "
62134	62142	62143	62144	The maid	1634	" My lady ! It 's come ! "
62344	62359	62361	62362	the maid	1634	" The boy that brought it looked just fit to drop , my lady ! "
62432	62446	62447	62447	she	686	" Run down and tell Wilson to give him some wine and cake ! "
62452	62474	62447	62447	she	686	" It 's all Fanchette 's fault -- odious creature!--running it to the last like this -- after all her promises ! "
62505	62511	62512	62512	Kitty	243	" Did Wilson feed him ? "
62532	62556	62558	62559	the girl	739	" Yes , my lady . It was quite a little fellow . He said his legs were just run off his feet , "
62570	62574	62576	62576	Kitty	243	" Poor wretch ! "
62580	62631	62576	62576	Kitty	243	" I 'm glad I 'm not an errand -- Blanche ! you know Fanchette may be an old demon , but she _ has _ got taste ! Just look at these folds , and the way she 's put on the pearls ! Now then -- make haste ! "
62757	62763	62796	62796	she	1634	" Oh , my lady ! "
62772	62775	62777	62777	Kitty	243	" Well ? "
62780	62784	62777	62777	Kitty	243	frowning--"eh , Blanche ? "
62800	62820	62796	62796	she	1634	" If you ask me , my lady , I think you have never looked so well in anything . "
63131	63140	63145	63146	her husband	891	" Well , upon my word , Kitty ! "
63156	63162	63163	63163	she	243	" Do you like it ? "
63244	63251	63252	63252	he	891	" What Endymion are you calling ? "
63256	63264	63252	63252	he	891	" Kitty , you are a dream ! "
63278	63315	63265	63265	Kitty	243	" Look at those silk things , sir . Nobody but Fanchette could have made them look anything but a botch . But they spoil the dress . And all to please mother and Mrs. Grundy ! "
63316	63354	63382	63383	the maid	1634	" I like them . I suppose -- the nearest you could get to buskins ? You would have preferred ankles _ au naturel _ ? I do n't think you 'd have been admitted , Kitty . "
63355	63370	63372	63372	Kitty	243	" Should n't I ? And so few people have feet they can show ! "
63400	63412	63382	63383	the maid	1634	" What do you think about it , eh , Blanche ? "
63413	63425	63427	63428	the maid	1634	" I think her ladyship is much better as she is , "
63432	63444	63427	63428	the maid	1634	" She 'd have felt very strange when she got there . "
63453	63458	63459	63459	she	243	" Go to bed ! "
63472	63503	63459	63459	she	243	" Go to bed at once ! Esther can give me my cloak . Do you know , William , she was awake all last night thinking of her brother ? "
63504	63521	63523	63523	Ashe	243	" The brother who has had an operation ? But I thought there was good news ? "
63527	63533	63536	63536	Kitty	243	" He 's much better , "
63538	63576	63577	63577	she	243	" She heard this afternoon . She wo n't be such a goose as to lie awake , I Should hope , to - night . Do n't let me catch you here when I get back ! "
63591	63641	63577	63577	she	243	" Mr. Ashe will help me , and if he pulls the strings into knots , I shall just cut them -- so there ! Go away , get your supper , and go to bed . Such a life as I 've led them all to - day ! "
63785	63794	63795	63795	she	243	" Have you heard anything more about Tuesday ? "
63801	63829	63751	63751	Kitty	243	" Oh yes!--compliments by the dozen . Old Parham overtook me as I was walking away from the House , and said all manner of civil things . "
63830	63840	63842	63842	Kitty	243	" And I met Lady Parham in Marshall 's , "
63844	63865	63842	63842	Kitty	243	" She does thank so badly ! I should like to show her how to do it . Dear me ! "
63869	63884	63866	63866	Kitty	243	" Am I henceforth to live and die on Lady Parham 's ample breast ? "
63898	63908	63910	63910	Ashe	243	" And shall I tell you what mother said ? "
63915	63918	63919	63919	He	2250	" Yes . "
64298	64317	64292	64292	she	243	" Well , darling ! I hope I have made a sufficient fool of myself to please you ! "
64392	64407	64409	64409	Ashe	243	" You 're a very rococo sort of goddess , you know , Kitty ! "
64411	64418	64409	64409	Ashe	243	" Not much Greek about you ! "
64419	64430	64432	64432	Kitty	243	" Quite as much as I want , thank you , "
64443	64462	64432	64432	Kitty	243	" Fanchette could have taught them a thing or two ! Now come along ! Ah ! Wait ! "
64527	64539	64512	64512	she	243	" Nurse is not in bed . You may come in . "
64575	64587	64588	64588	he	2274	" A parcel of idiots , nurse , are n't we ? "
64651	64658	64610	64610	She	243	" We must go , Kitty . "
64659	64668	64669	64669	she	243	" I wish he were a little older , "
64678	64699	64669	64669	she	243	" that he might wake up and see us both ! I should like him to remember me like this . "
64700	64708	64710	64710	Ashe	243	" Queen and huntress , come away ! "
64735	64738	64740	64740	Ashe	243	" Kitty , "
64744	64761	64740	64740	Ashe	243	" give me one kiss . You 're so sweet to - night -- so sweet ! "
64765	64772	64773	64773	she	243	" Take care of my dress ! "
64996	65014	64975	64975	he	2280	" Kitty , do you know that I had a letter from your mother , this morning ? "
65015	65019	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" Had you ? "
65029	65037	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" I suppose she wanted some money . "
65038	65063	64975	64975	he	2280	" She did . She says she is very hard up . If I cared to use it , I have an easy reply . "
65064	65070	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" What do you mean ? "
65071	65088	64975	64975	he	2280	" I might say , ' D --- n it , we are , too ! ' "
65093	65109	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" Do n't begin to talk money matters now , William , _ please _ . "
65110	65128	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" No , dear , I wo n't . But we shall really have to draw in . "
65129	65139	65141	65141	Kitty	243	" You _ will _ pay so many debts ! "
65153	65203	65021	65021	Kitty	243	" That 's my extravagance , is n't it ? I assure you I go on the most approved principles . I divide our available money among the greatest number of hungry claimants it will stretch to . But , after all , it goes a beggarly short way . "
65204	65217	65219	65219	Kitty	243	" I know mother will think my diamond crescent a horrible extravagance , "
65223	65241	65219	65219	Kitty	243	" But you are the only son , William , and we must behave like other people . "
65242	65252	65253	65253	he	2287	" Dear , do n't trouble your little head , "
65256	65264	65253	65253	he	2287	" I 'll manage it , somehow . "
65610	65613	65614	65614	he	2287	" Mary ! "
65617	65664	65614	65614	he	2287	" à la Sir Joshua -- and mother . They do n't see us . Query , will Cliffe take the leap to - night ? Mother reports a decided increase of ardor on his part . Sorry you do n't approve of it , darling ! "
65665	65682	65684	65684	Kitty	243	" It 's just like lighting a lamp to put it out -- that 's all ! "
65689	65699	65684	65684	Kitty	243	" The man who marries Mary is done for . "
65700	65746	65614	65614	he	2287	" Not at all . Mary 's money will give him the pedestal he wants , and trust Cliffe to take care of his own individuality afterwards ! Now , if you 'll transfer your alarms to _ Mary _ , I 'm with you ! "
65747	65778	65684	65684	Kitty	243	" Oh ! of _ course _ he 'll be unkind to her . She may lay her account for that . But it 's the _ marrying _ her ! "
65795	65808	65614	65614	he	2287	" Kitty , really!--you remind me , please , of Miss Jane Taylor :
65809	65826	65614	65614	he	2287	" ' I did not think there could be found -- a little heart so hard ! '
65852	65852	65842	65842	She	223	"
65853	65872	65614	65614	he	2287	" Well , she wo n't get -- anything . Geoffrey Cliffe thinks of no one but himself . "
65879	65896	65873	65873	Ashe	243	" Oh , well , all men are selfish -- and the women do n't mind . "
65897	65906	65908	65908	Kitty	243	" It depends on how it 's done , "
65920	65923	65910	65910	Ashe	243	" l'homme sensuel moyen"--with
66020	66031	66032	66032	She	243	" Do you want me to be nice to her ? "
66038	66051	66053	66053	Ashe	243	" Bind her to your chariot wheels , madam ! You can ! "
66064	66098	66061	66061	Kitty	243	" Well , then , I wo n't tell her that I _ know _ he 's still in love with the Frenchwoman . But it 's on the tip of my tongue . "
66099	66102	66104	66104	Ashe	243	" Heavens ! "
66106	66130	66104	66104	Ashe	243	" The Vicomtesse D--- , the lady of the poems ? But she 's dead ! I thought that was over long ago . "
66147	66164	66131	66131	Kitty	243	" That any one could write those poems , and then _ think _ of Mary ! "
66165	66173	66175	66175	Ashe	243	" Yes , the poems were fine , "
66177	66183	66175	66175	Ashe	243	" but make - believe ! "
66206	66212	66213	66213	she	243	" Say what you like ! "
66221	66240	66213	66213	she	243	" But , often and often , he says divine things -- divinely ! I feel them there ! "
66254	66257	66259	66259	Ashe	243	" Goddess ! "
66271	66294	66259	66259	Ashe	243	" And to think that I should have dared to roast the divine one in a _ Times _ letter this morning ! "
66416	66424	66425	66425	he	2314	" What are we doing it for ? "
66443	66451	66453	66454	the other	1973	" Oh , do n't be superior ! "
66456	66469	66453	66454	the other	1973	" I 'm going to enjoy myself like a school - boy ! "
67010	67016	67018	67021	a voice in front	2361	" Kitty , make haste ! "
67031	67038	67024	67024	Kitty	243	" Your quadrille is just called . "
67143	67148	67235	67235	Harman	242	" What is she ? "
67149	67162	67235	67235	Harman	242	" Oh , something mythological ! She 's in the next quadrille . "
67163	67185	67235	67235	Harman	242	" My dear , she 's Diana ! Look at her bow and quiver , and the moon in her hair . "
67186	67196	67235	67235	Harman	242	" Very incorrect!--she ought to have the towered crown ! "
67197	67213	67235	67235	Harman	242	" Absurd , such a little thing to attempt Diana ! I 'd back Actæon ! "
67240	67311	67235	67235	Harman	242	" You do n't understand . She 's not Greek , of course ; but she 's fairyland . A child of the Renaissance , dreaming in a wood , would have seen Artemis so -- dressed up and glittering , and fantastic -- as the Florentines saw Venus . Small , too , like the fairies!--slipping through the leaves ; small hounds , with jewelled collars , following her ! "
67328	67337	67339	67339	Cliffe	252	" She has seen a French print somewhere , "
67346	67357	67339	67339	Cliffe	252	" More Versailles in it than fairyland , I think ! "
67358	67368	67370	67370	Harman	242	" It is _ she _ that is fairyland , "
67607	67608	67611	67611	Mercury	428	" Spring"--and
67824	67828	67830	67830	Kitty	243	" Awfully becoming ! "
67836	67841	67830	67830	Kitty	243	" Who are you ? "
67842	67849	67851	67851	Mary	223	" My great - great aunt ! "
67855	67866	67851	67851	Mary	223	" You , I see , go even farther back . "
67867	67873	67875	67875	Kitty	243	" Is n't it fun ? "
67881	67900	67875	67875	Kitty	243	" Have you seen William ? Poor dear ! he 's so hot . How do you do ? "
67922	67949	67984	67984	she	243	" Excuse me . I did not see you . I was absorbed in your dress . You are Artemis , I see -- with additions . "
67950	67962	67964	67964	Kitty	243	" Oh ! I am an ' article de Paris , ' "
67966	67982	67964	67964	Kitty	243	" But it seems odd that some people should take me for Joan of Arc . "
67989	67998	67999	67999	she	243	" I think your dress is quite lovely ! "
68028	68039	67999	67999	she	243	" Do n't you admire it enormously , Mr. Cliffe ? "
68040	68043	68045	68045	Cliffe	323	" Enormously , "
68052	68061	68045	68045	Cliffe	323	" But by now my compliments are stale . "
68062	68071	68073	68073	Kitty	243	" Is he cross about William 's letter ? "
68075	68085	68073	68073	Kitty	243	" Well , let 's leave them to themselves . "
68116	68127	68104	68104	She	243	" Are you -- Oh ! of course , I remember-- "
68203	68217	68218	68218	he	323	" I should apologize , no doubt , for not taking your advice , "
68239	68247	68248	68248	Kitty	243	" Did I give you any advice ? "
68255	68261	68248	68248	Kitty	243	" I do n't recollect . "
68399	68408	68409	68409	she	243	" I _ am _ a little beast ! "
68414	68422	68409	68409	she	243	" Why should n't she be happy ? "
68455	68459	68448	68448	She	243	" raining influence . "
68606	68621	68622	68622	she	222	" We shall soon all of us be ashamed of this kind of thing , "
68627	68645	68622	68622	she	222	" Just as people now are beginning to be ashamed of enormous houses and troops of servants . "
68646	68656	68658	68658	Kitty	243	" No , please ! Only bored with them ! "
68660	68676	68658	68658	Kitty	243	" There are so many other ways now of amusing yourself -- that 's all . "
68677	68686	68688	68689	Lady Tranmore	222	" Well , this way will die out , "
68691	68706	68688	68689	Lady Tranmore	222	" The cost of it is too scandalous -- people 's consciences prick them . "
69063	69069	69070	69070	she	2413	" sea - king 's daughter "
69120	69128	69130	69130	Kitty	243	" Oh , beautiful , beautiful world ! "
69144	69152	69130	69130	Kitty	243	" how I love you!--_love _ you ! "
69180	69185	69187	69187	Harman	242	" A strange sight , "
69189	69197	69187	69187	Harman	242	" Perhaps they take it too seriously . "
69198	69208	69210	69210	Darrell	246	" Ah ! that is our English upper class , "
69216	69254	69210	69210	Darrell	246	" Is there anything they take lightly?--_par exemple ! _ It seems to me they carry off this amusement better than most . They may be stupid , but they are good - looking . I say , Ashe"--he
69267	69284	69187	69187	Harman	242	them--"on this exceptional occasion , is it allowed to congratulate you on Lady Kitty 's gown ? "
69350	69365	69348	69348	himself	242	" By George ! that queer marriage is turning out well , after all . "
69391	69394	69396	69396	Kitty	243	" William ! "
69415	69427	69428	69428	She	243	" Lord Hubert takes me in to supper . Poor me ! "
69500	69510	69511	69511	she	243	" I promised to wait here for Lord Hubert , "
69514	69526	69511	69511	she	243	" You go on , or you 'll get no tables . "
69717	69730	69732	69733	Lady Parham	360	" Well , of course you 've heard that we got through , "
69735	69743	69732	69733	Lady Parham	360	" For once Lady Kitty behaved herself ! "
69744	69749	69751	69752	Mary Lyster	223	" You were lucky ! "
69754	69760	69751	69752	Mary Lyster	223	" Lady Tranmore was dreadfully anxious-- "
69761	69771	69773	69774	Lady Parham	360	" Lest she should cut us at the last ? "
69776	69791	69792	69792	She	360	" Well , of course , Lady Kitty is ' capable de tout . ' "
69795	69811	69792	69792	She	360	" But perhaps as you are a cousin I ought n't to say these things . "
69812	69820	69822	69822	Mary	223	" Oh , say what you like , "
69824	69839	69822	69822	Mary	223	" I am no friend of Kitty 's , and never pretended to be . "
69852	69879	69840	69841	Lady Parham	360	" What on earth made that man marry her ? He might have married anybody . She had no money , and worse than no position . "
69880	69931	69792	69792	She	360	" She worked upon his pity , of course , a good deal . I saw them in the early days at Grosville Park . She played her cards very cleverly . And then , it was just the right moment . Lady Tranmore had been urging him to marry . "
69932	69938	69940	69941	Lady Parham	360	" Well , of course , "
69943	69951	69940	69941	Lady Parham	360	" there 's no denying the beauty . "
69952	69957	69959	69959	Mary	223	" You think so ? "
69966	69984	69959	69959	Mary	223	" Well , I never could see it . And now she has so much gone off . "
69985	70013	70014	70014	Kitty	243	" I do n't agree with you . Many people think her the star to - night . Mr. Cliffe , I am told , admires her . "
70048	70105	70045	70045	Mary	223	" Poor Kitty ! She tried to flirt with him long ago -- just after she arrived in London , fresh out of the convent . It was so funny ! He told me afterwards he never was so embarrassed in his life -- this baby making eyes at him ! And now -- oh no ! "
70106	70125	70165	70166	Lady Parham	360	" Why not now ? Lady Kitty 's very much the rage , and Mr. Cliffe likes notoriety . "
70126	70150	70045	70045	Mary	223	" But a notoriety with -- well , with some style , some distinction ! Kitty 's sort is so cheap and silly . "
70151	70163	70165	70166	Lady Parham	360	" Ah , well , she 's not to be despised , "
70168	70189	70165	70166	Lady Parham	360	" She 's as clever as she can be . But her husband will have to keep her in order . "
70190	70194	70196	70196	Mary	223	" Can he ? "
70198	70208	70196	70196	Mary	223	" Wo n't she always be in his way ? "
70209	70239	70045	70045	Mary	223	" Always , I should think . But he must have known what he was about . Why did n't his mother interfere ? Such a family!--such a history ! "
70240	70245	70247	70247	Mary	223	" She did interfere , "
70249	70254	70247	70247	Mary	223	" We all did our best"--she
70257	70309	70045	70045	Mary	223	voice--"I know I did . But it was no use . If men like spoiled children they must have them , I suppose . Let 's hope he 'll learn how to manage her . Shall we go on ? I promised to meet my supper - partner in the library . "
70419	70446	70415	70415	she	243	" Take me down to supper , Mr. Cliffe . I ca n't wait for Lord Hubert any more , I 'm _ so _ hungry ! "
70447	70450	70452	70452	Cliffe	323	" Enchanted ! "
70469	70475	70462	70462	he	323	" But I came to find-- "
70476	70512	70514	70514	she	243	" Miss Lyster ? Oh , she is gone in with Mr. Darrell . Come with me . I have a ticket for the reserved tent . We shall have a delicious corner to ourselves . "
70803	70819	70820	70820	he	323	" A very ineffective statement Ashe made to - night -- don't you think so ? "
70826	70855	70820	70820	he	323	" Very ! Really , if the government ca n't take up a stronger line , the general public will begin to think there 's something in it . "
70856	70913	70820	70820	he	323	" Oh , if you only shriek long enough and sharp enough in England something 's sure to come of it . Cliffe and his group have been playing a very shrewd game . The government will get their agreement approved all right , but Cliffe has certainly made some people on our side uneasy . However-- "
70914	70919	70921	70922	the other	1973	" However , what ? "
70928	70945	70947	70949	the first speaker	2473	" I wish I thought that were the only reason for Ashe 's change of tone , "
70953	70959	70820	70820	he	323	" What do you mean ? "
70993	71026	70820	70820	he	323	" Well , you see , it 's not very easy to grapple in public with the man whose name all smart London happens to be coupling with that of your wife ! "
71027	71029	70820	70820	he	323	" I say"--the
71038	71051	70820	70820	he	323	distress--"you do n't mean to say that there 's that in it ! "
71052	71139	70820	70820	he	323	" You notice that the difference is not in _ what _ Ashe says , but in _ how _ he says it . He avoids all personal collision with Cliffe . The government stick to their case , but Ashe mentions everybody but Cliffe , and confutes all arguments but his . And meanwhile , of course , the truth is that Cliffe is the head and front of the campaign , and if he threw up to - morrow , everything would quiet down . "
71140	71167	70820	70820	he	323	" And Lady Kitty is flirting with him at this particular moment ? Damned bad taste and bad feeling , to say the least of it ! "
71168	71189	71191	71192	the other	1973	" You wo n't find one of the Bristol lot consider that kind of thing when their blood is up ! "
71194	71204	71191	71192	the other	1973	" You remember the tales of old Lord Blackwater ? "
71205	71221	70820	70820	he	323	" But is there really any truth in it ? Or is it mere gossip ? "
71222	71330	71191	71192	the other	1973	" Well , I hear that the behavior of both of them at Grosville Park last week was such that Lady Grosville vows she will never ask either of them again . And at Ascot , at Lord 's , the opera , Lady Kitty sits with him , talks with him , walks with him , the whole time , and wo n't look at any one else . They must be asked together or neither will come -- and ' society , ' as far as I can make out , thinks it a good joke and is always making plans to throw them together . "
71331	71339	70820	70820	he	323	" Ca n't Lady Tranmore do anything ? "
71340	71362	71191	71192	the other	1973	" I do n't know . They say she is very unhappy about it . Certainly she looks ill and depressed . "
71363	71367	70820	70820	he	323	" And Ashe ? "
71372	71430	71368	71369	His companion	725	" I do n't like to say it , but , of course , you know there are many people who will tell you that Ashe does n't care twopence what his wife does so long as she is nice to him , and he can read his books and carry on his politics as he pleases ! "
71431	71442	71444	71445	the other	1973	" Ashe always strikes me as the soul of honor , "
71449	71481	71368	71369	His companion	725	" Of course -- for himself . But a more fatalist believer in liberty than Ashe does n't exist -- liberty especially to damn yourself -- if you must and will . "
71482	71495	71497	71498	the other	1973	" It would be hard to extend that doctrine to a wife , "
71924	71930	71932	71932	Ashe	243	" And , by George ! "
71939	71944	71932	71932	Ashe	243	" she warned me . "
71968	71993	71966	71966	Kitty	243	franknesses--"I shall take mad fancies for people . I sha'n't be able to help it . I have one now , for Geoffrey Cliffe . "
72030	72032	72028	72033	the ordinary " fast " woman	2502	" fast "
73079	73085	73074	73074	he	2514	" H'm . Lady Grosville ! "
73146	73181	73136	73136	she	243	" I wonder Kitty condescends to go to the woman 's house ! She must know that everything she does is seen there _ en noir _ . Pharisaical , narrow - minded Philistines ! "
73195	73198	73194	73201	the " old gorgon " who wrote it	2542	" old gorgon "
73325	73330	73331	73331	he	2514	" Why , Blanche ! "
73347	73355	73331	73331	he	2514	servants--"I am afraid your brother is worse ? "
73381	73391	73393	73393	Blanche	403	" Oh no , sir -- no , sir ! "
73417	73438	73439	73439	she	403	" It 's not that , sir , thank you . I was just putting away her ladyship 's things , "
73449	73461	73463	73463	Ashe	243	" That was hardly what caused the tears , was it ? "
73467	73481	73463	73463	Ashe	243	" Is there anything in which Lady Kitty or I could help you ? "
73502	73516	73482	73483	The girl	739	" Thank you , sir ; I 've just given her ladyship warning . "
73517	73520	73522	73522	Ashe	243	" Indeed ! "
73526	73542	73522	73522	Ashe	243	" I 'm sorry for that . I thought you got on here very well . "
73543	73600	73482	73483	The girl	739	" I used to , sir , but this last few weeks there 's nothing pleases her ladyship ; you ca n't do anything right . I 'm sure I 've worked my hands off . But I ca n't do any more . Perhaps her ladyship will find some one else to suit her better . "
73601	73613	73522	73522	Ashe	243	" Did n't her ladyship try to persuade you to stay ? "
73614	73674	73482	73483	The girl	739	" Yes -- but -- I gave warning once before , and then I stayed . And it 's no good . It seems as if you must do wrong . And I do n't sleep , sir . It gets on your nerves so . But I did n't mean to complain . Good - night , sir . "
73675	73698	73522	73522	Ashe	243	" Good - night . Do n't sit up for your mistress . You look tired out . I 'll help her . "
73699	73705	73707	73708	the maid	1634	" Thank you , sir , "
73887	73898	73899	73899	she	914	" It is a delight to see Lady Kitty dance , "
73906	73920	73899	73899	she	914	" But she is tired . I am sure she wants the country . "
73921	73926	73928	73928	Ashe	243	" Like my boy , "
73930	73940	73899	73899	she	914	" I wish to goodness they 'd both go . "
73941	73957	73965	73966	the daughter	1112	" Oh , I know it 's hard to leave the husband toiling in town ! "
74067	74071	74043	74044	Lady Parham	360	" a last chance "
74152	74157	74159	74159	Ashe	243	" Confound the woman ! "
74167	74177	74178	74178	he	2562	" Working as hard as usual , Lady Parham ? "
74186	74195	74144	74144	she	360	" If you like to put it so , "
74201	74215	74178	74178	he	2562	" There is , of course , a good deal of going out . "
74216	74239	74178	74178	he	2562	" I hope , if I may say so , you do n't allow Lord Parham to do too much of it . "
74240	74250	74252	74255	Lord Parham 's spouse	2584	" Lord Parham never was better in his life , "
74266	74294	74178	74178	he	2562	" That 's good news . I must say when I saw him this afternoon I thought he seemed to be feeling his work a good deal . "
74295	74302	74304	74305	Lady Parham	360	" Oh , he 's worried , "
74309	74317	74318	74318	She	360	" Worried about a good many things . "
74334	74345	74347	74347	Ashe	243	" Ah , that 's where the wives come in ! "
74351	74378	74347	74347	Ashe	243	" Look at Mrs. Loraine . She has the art to perfection -- hasn't she ? The way she cushions Loraine is something wonderful to see . "
74528	74535	74537	74537	Kitty	243	" Oh ! how d'you do ? "
74600	74606	74608	74608	Ashe	243	" I say , Kitty , "
74620	74637	74608	74608	Ashe	243	" I thought Lady Parham was eternally obliged to us . What 's wrong with her ? "
74638	74647	74649	74649	Kitty	243	" Only that I ca n't stand her , "
74651	74659	74649	74649	Kitty	243	" What 's the good of trying ? "
74672	74677	74679	74679	Ashe	243	" What , indeed ? "
74687	74718	74679	74679	Ashe	243	" Her manners are beyond the bounds . But look here , Kitty , do n't you think you 'll come home ? You know you do look uncommonly tired . "
74722	74744	74745	74745	she	243	" Home ? Why , I 'm only just beginning to enjoy myself ! Take me into the cool , please , "
75053	75072	75038	75038	he	2595	" This is my dance , I think , Miss Lyster . Where shall we sit it out ? "
75094	75102	75104	75104	Cliffe	252	" Just read your remarks this evening , "
75108	75125	75104	75104	Cliffe	252	" Well , now , I suppose to - morrow will see your ship in port ? "
75146	75165	75104	75104	Cliffe	252	" Certainly . But you may at least reflect that you have lost us a deal of time . "
75166	75173	75175	75175	Cliffe	252	" And now you slay us , "
75177	75189	75175	75175	Cliffe	252	" Ah , well--'_dulce et decorum est _ , ' etcetera . "
75190	75205	75207	75207	Ashe	243	" Do n't imagine that you 'll get many of the honors of martyrdom , "
75235	75238	75239	75239	Cliffe	252	" Why ? "
75275	75293	75267	75267	her	223	" Why ? Because the heresies have no martyrs . The halo is for the true Church ! "
75294	75297	75299	75299	Cliffe	252	" H'm ! "
75306	75315	75299	75299	Cliffe	252	" I suppose you mean for the successful ? "
75316	75320	75322	75322	Ashe	243	" Do I ? "
75327	75342	75322	75322	Ashe	243	" Are n't the true Church the people who are justified by the event ? "
75343	75351	75353	75353	Cliffe	252	" The orthodox like to think so , "
75355	75367	75353	75353	Cliffe	252	" But the heretics have a way of coming out top . "
75368	75407	75412	75412	Ashe	243	" Does that mean you chaps are going to win at the next election ? I devoutly hope you may--_we_'re all as stale as ditch - water -- and as for places , anybody 's welcome to mine ! "
75436	75443	75445	75445	Cliffe	252	" Ashe trifles it as usual , "
75461	75474	75445	75445	Cliffe	252	" Is there anything in the world that he really cares about ? "
75492	75498	75487	75487	her	223	" Yes ! his wife . "
75509	75517	75518	75518	she	223	" His not caring is a pretence , "
75521	75551	75518	75518	she	223	" At least , Lady Tranmore thinks so . She believes that he is becoming absorbed in politics -- much more ambitious than she ever thought he would be . "
75552	75560	75562	75562	Cliffe	252	" That 's the way of mothers , "
75569	75592	75562	75562	Cliffe	252	" They have got to make the best of their sons . Tell me what you are going to do this summer . "
76160	76165	76169	76169	himself	252	" That 's finished , "
76189	76195	76169	76169	himself	252	" Now for the other ! "
76469	76476	76477	76477	He	252	" I 'm ready , William . "
76488	76507	76477	76477	He	252	" Come along , then ! In five minutes more I should have been asleep on the stairs . "
76600	76606	76621	76621	she	360	" Do you see that ? "
76634	76641	76642	76642	she	360	" Call my carriage , please ! "
76700	76709	76783	76784	the judge	2648	" Move on , cabby ! Move on ! "
76710	76718	76720	76721	the driver	2645	" Stand clear , ma'am , please , "
76740	76745	76747	76752	an impatient judge behind Lady Parham	2647	" Who is it ? "
76754	76760	76747	76752	an impatient judge behind Lady Parham	2647	" What 's the matter ? "
76767	76774	76783	76786	the judge 's daughter	2649	" It 's Lady Kitty Ashe , "
76788	76799	76783	76786	the judge 's daughter	2649	" talking to Mr. Cliffe . Is n't she pretty ? "
76832	76841	76842	76842	He	252	" Kitty , do n't stop the way . "
76900	76908	76909	76909	she	243	" Are you going with Lady Parham ? "
76918	76921	76909	76909	she	243	" Yes . "
76952	76958	76960	76961	Lady Parham	360	" Come , Miss Lyster ! "
77059	77071	77073	77073	Ashe	243	" Better not do that again , Kitty , I think , "
77089	77095	77096	77096	she	243	" Why should n't I ? "
77110	77123	77096	77096	she	243	" I was telling Geoffrey where to find me at Lord 's . "
77128	77130	77075	77075	Kitty	243	" Archangelism "
77136	77143	77075	77075	Kitty	243	" You kept Lady Parham waiting . "
77144	77150	77152	77152	Kitty	243	" What does that matter ? "
77159	77168	77170	77170	Ashe	243	" And you did Cliffe too much honor , "
77172	77188	77170	77170	Ashe	243	" It 's the men who should stand on the steps -- not the women ! "
77193	77199	77200	77200	she	243	" What do you mean ? "
77210	77216	77170	77170	Ashe	243	" Just what I say , "
77264	77277	77259	77259	she	243	" Do n't , please , say impertinent things to me again ! "

77455	77459	77461	77461	Kitty	243	" Lie down , "
77471	77484	77461	77461	Kitty	243	" and do n't say anything . I shall go to sleep . "
77652	77658	77660	77660	Kitty	243	" Oh , come in , "
77665	77684	77660	77660	Kitty	243	" Margaret 's here ; but if you do n't mind her , she wo n't mind you . "
77734	77741	77742	77742	Margaret	341	" Excuse me , Mr. Ashe , "
77748	77788	77742	77742	Margaret	341	" I had to be out on business for my brother all day , so I thought I 'd come early and remind Kitty of some of these tiresome things while there was still a chance of finding her . "
77789	77800	77802	77802	Ashe	247	" I do n't know why guardian angels excuse themselves , "
77809	77822	77824	77824	Kitty	243	" Oh , dear , what a lot of them there are ! "
77835	77851	77824	77824	Kitty	243	" Refuse them all , Margaret ; I 'm tired to death of dining out . "
77852	77859	77861	77861	Margaret	341	" Not all , I think , "
77863	77895	77861	77861	Margaret	341	" Here 's that nice woman -- you remember -- who wanted to thank Mr. Ashe for what he 'd done for her son . You promised to dine with her . "
77896	77900	77901	77901	Kitty	243	" Did I ? "
77906	77945	77901	77901	Kitty	243	" Well , then , I suppose we must . What did William do for her ? When I ask him to do something for the nicest boys in the world , he wo n't lift a finger . "
77946	77955	77957	77957	Ashe	247	" I gave him some introductions in Berlin , "
77959	77991	77957	77957	Ashe	247	" What you generally want me to do , Kitty , is to stuff the public service with good - looking idiots . And there I really ca n't oblige you . "
77992	78003	78005	78005	Kitty	243	" Every one knows that corruption gets the best men , "
78007	78014	78016	78016	she	243	" Hullo , what 's that ? "
78029	78039	78041	78042	Margaret French	341	" My dear Kitty ! when did it come ? "
78092	78101	78102	78102	he	2684	" I think that came ten days ago , "
78107	78114	78102	78102	he	2684	" I imagined Kitty accepted it . "
78115	78127	78129	78129	Kitty	243	" I never thought of it from that day to this , "
78146	78151	78129	78129	Kitty	243	" Say , please , that"--she
78156	78176	78134	78134	her	243	deliberately--"Mr . and Lady Kitty Ashe -- are unable to accept -- Lord and Lady Parham 's invitation -- etc.-- "
78177	78180	78182	78182	Margaret	341	" Kitty ! "
78186	78211	78182	78182	Margaret	341	" there must be a ' regret ' and a ' kind . ' Think ! Ten days ! The party is next week ! "
78212	78224	78226	78226	Kitty	243	" No ' regret , ' and no ' kind ' ! "
78232	78262	78226	78226	Kitty	243	" It 's my affair , please , Margaret , altogether . And I 'll see the note before it goes , or you 'll be putting in civilities . "
78387	78399	78400	78400	he	2684	" Why did you come in to visit me , Kitty ? "
78408	78414	78416	78416	her	243	" I do n't know , "
78432	78442	78443	78443	His	2684	" I wish I could understand you , Kitty . "
78450	78459	78461	78461	Kitty	243	" Well , I do n't understand myself ! "
78486	78497	78499	78499	Ashe	243	" Perhaps , if you submitted the problem to me , "
78503	78514	78499	78499	Ashe	243	" we might be able to thresh it out together ! "
78610	78627	78606	78606	Ashe	243	" Anyway , dear , do n't give silly tongues _ too _ good a handle ! "
78663	78667	78669	78669	Kitty	243	" You mean , "
78673	78686	78669	78669	Kitty	243	" that I am not to talk so much to Geoffrey Cliffe ? "
78687	78693	78695	78695	Ashe	243	" Is he worth it ? "
78697	78714	78695	78695	Ashe	243	" That 's what I want to know -- worth the fuss that some people make ? "
78715	78728	78730	78730	Kitty	243	" It 's the fuss and the people that drive one on , "
78736	78789	78695	78695	Ashe	243	" You flatter them too much , darling ! Do you think you were quite kind to me last night?--let 's put it that way . I looked a precious fool , you know , standing on those steps , while you were keeping old Mother Parham and the whole show waiting ! "
78807	78818	78819	78819	she	243	" I ca n't think what made you marry me , "
78831	78838	78839	78839	he	2692	" And I ca n't think , "
78847	78875	78839	78839	he	2692	" what made you come -- if you were n't a little bit sorry -- and lean your dear head against me like that , last night . "
78876	78887	78889	78889	her	243	" I was n't sorry -- I could n't sleep , "
78923	78948	78918	78918	Kitty	243	" I was to tell you , sir , that your breakfast was ready . And Lady Tranmore 's servant has brought this note . "
78959	78967	78969	78969	Kitty	243	" Get my things ready , please , "
79016	79028	79029	79029	she	403	" Why did you say those foolish things to me yesterday ? "
79053	79062	79064	79064	Blanche	403	" They were n't foolish , my lady , "
79072	79076	79078	79078	Kitty	243	" They were ! "
79080	79123	79078	79078	Kitty	243	" Of course , I 'm a vixen -- I always was . But you know , Blanche , I 'm not always as bad as I have been lately . Very soon I shall be quite charming again -- you'll see ! "
79124	79132	79133	79133	Blanche	403	" I dare say , my lady . "
79168	79226	79151	79151	Kitty	243	" You know how I abused you about my hair , Blanche ? Well , Mrs. Alcot said , that very night , she never saw it so well done . She thought it must be Pierrefitte 's best man . Was n't it hellish of me ? I knew quite well you 'd done it beautifully . "
79245	79270	79227	79228	The maid	1634	" And you remember the green garibaldi -- last week ? I just loathed it -- because you 'd forgotten that little black rosette . "
79271	79274	79276	79276	Blanche	403	" No ! "
79281	79289	79276	79276	Blanche	403	" your ladyship had never ordered it . "
79290	79346	79227	79228	The maid	1634	" I did -- I did ! But never mind . Two of my friends have wanted to copy it , Blanche . They would n't believe it was done by a maid . They said it had such style . One of them would engage you to - morrow if you really want to go-- "
79350	79362	79364	79364	Kitty	243	" But you wo n't go , Blanchie , will you ? "
79369	79400	79401	79401	she	243	" I 'm a horrid fiend , but I did get Mr. Ashe to help your young man -- and I did care about your poor brother -- and -- and-- "
79406	79433	79401	79401	she	243	arm--"I do look rather nice when I 'm dressed , do n't I ? You would n't like a great gawk to dress , would you ? "
79434	79447	79449	79450	the girl	739	" I 'm sure I do n't want to leave your ladyship , "
79454	79462	79449	79450	the girl	739	" But I ca n't have no more-- "
79463	79468	79470	79470	Kitty	243	" No more ructions ? "
79474	79556	79470	79470	Kitty	243	" H'm , of course that 's serious , because I 'm made so . Well , now , look here , Blanchie , you wo n't give me warning again for a fortnight , whatever I do , mind . And if by then I 'm past praying for , you may . And I 'll import a Russian -- or a Choctaw -- who wo n't understand when I call her names . Is that a bargain , Blanchie ? "
79561	79566	79568	79568	Kitty	243	" Just a fortnight ! "
79576	79583	79571	79571	her	243	" Very well , my lady . "
79657	79667	79668	79668	she	243	" What _ is _ the matter with me ? "
79671	79697	79668	79668	she	243	" William is an angel , and I love him . And I ca n't do what he wants -- I _ ca n't _ ! "
79729	79808	79698	79698	She	243	" People _ are _ possessed -- I know they are . They ca n't help themselves . I began this to punish Mary -- and now -- when I do n't see Geoffrey , everything is odious and dreary . I ca n't care for anything . Of course , I ought to care for William 's politics . I expect I 've done him harm -- I know I have . What 's wrong with me ? "
80147	80150	80197	80197	Cliffe	252	" hard cases "

80734	80742	80743	80743	she	243	" I do n't care for him , "
80754	80781	80743	80743	she	243	" but I must see him -- I _ will _ ! And I will talk to him as I please , and where I please ! "
80845	80872	80838	80839	Lady Tranmore	222	" I shall be with you almost immediately after you receive this , as I want to catch you before you go to the Foreign Office . "
80915	80919	80927	80927	her	630	" Dear William , "
80945	81020	80927	80927	her	630	" you 'll forgive me , wo n't you?--even if I do seem to you prudish and absurd . But I am afraid you _ ought _ to tell Kitty some of the unkind things people are saying ! You know I 've tried , and she would n't listen to me . And you ought to beg her -- yes , William , indeed you ought!--not to give any further occasion for them . "
81069	81100	81054	81054	Ashe	243	" Kitty apparently enjoyed a moonlight walk with Cliffe . Why should n't she ? Lady Grosville thinks the moon was made to sleep by -- other people do n't . "
81101	81123	81150	81150	He	626	" But , William!--at night -- when everybody had gone to bed -- escaping from the house -- they two alone ! "
81208	81216	81218	81218	Ashe	243	" All the fault of the Grosvilles , "
81228	81298	81218	81218	Ashe	243	" in shutting up their great heavy house , and drawing their great heavy curtains on a May night , when all reasonable people want to be out - of - doors . My dear mother , what 's the good of paying any attention to what people like Lady Grosville say of people like Kitty ? You might as well expect Deborah to hit it off with Ariel ! "
81299	81306	81308	81309	his mother	630	" William , do n't laugh ! "
81314	81339	81308	81309	his mother	630	" Geoffrey Cliffe is not a man to be trusted . You and I know that of old . He is a boaster , and-- "
81340	81345	81347	81347	Ashe	243	" And a liar ! "
81351	81358	81347	81347	Ashe	243	" Oh ! I know that . "
81359	81383	81384	81384	she	630	" And yet he has this power over women -- one ought to look it in the face . William , dearest William ! "
81396	81410	81384	81384	she	630	" do persuade Kitty to go away from London now -- at once ! "
81411	81417	81419	81419	Ashe	243	" Kitty wo n't go , "
81423	81450	81419	81419	Ashe	243	" I am sorry , dear mother . I hate that you should be worried . But there 's the fact . Kitty wo n't go ! "
81451	81457	81459	81460	Lady Tranmore	222	" Then use your authority , "
81462	81467	81384	81384	she	630	" I have none . "
81468	81471	81472	81472	Ashe	243	" William ! "
81540	81604	81535	81535	he	626	" I should like you to understand me , mother . I can not fight with Kitty . Before I asked her to marry me , I made up my mind to that . I knew then and I know now that nothing but disaster could come of it . She must be free , and I shall not attempt to coerce her . "
81605	81611	81613	81614	his mother	630	" Or to protect her ! "
81616	81647	81613	81614	his mother	630	" As to that , I shall do what I can . But I clearly foresaw when we married that we should scandalize a good many of the weaker brethren . "
81664	81671	81648	81648	He	626	" William ! as a public man-- "
81676	81701	81648	81648	He	626	" If I can be both Kitty 's husband and a public man , well and good . If not , then I shall be-- "
81702	81707	81709	81710	Lady Tranmore	222	" Kitty 's husband ? "
81734	81755	81756	81756	she	222	" It is , of course , Kitty , first and foremost , who is concerned in your public position , "
81762	81820	81756	81756	she	222	" Dearest William -- she is so young still -- she probably does n't quite understand , in spite of her great cleverness . But she _ does _ care -- she _ must _ care -- and she ought to know what slight things may sometimes affect a man 's prospects and future in this country . "
81843	81852	81835	81836	Lady Tranmore	222	" William , I heard a rumor last night-- "
81859	81894	81853	81853	He	2744	" Lord Crashaw told me that the resignations would certainly be in the papers this week , and that the ministry would go on -- after a rearrangement of posts . Is it true ? "
81900	81944	81895	81895	Ashe	243	" True -- as to the facts -- so far as I know . As to the date , Lord Crashaw knows , I think , no more than I do . It may be this week , it may be next month . "
81945	81957	81958	81958	Elizabeth	365	" Then I hear -- thank goodness I never see her , "
81962	81975	81958	81958	Elizabeth	365	reluctantly--"that that dreadful woman , Lady Parham , is more infuriated than ever-- "
81976	81999	81895	81895	Ashe	243	" With Kitty ? Let her be ! It really does n't matter an old shoe , either to Kitty or me . "
82000	82018	81958	81958	Elizabeth	365	" She can be a most bitter enemy , William . And she certainly influences Lord Parham . "
82050	82062	82063	82063	she	222	" I wish I could get her out of my mind ! "
82072	82136	82066	82066	Ashe	243	" I daresay we shall hold our own . Xanthippe is not beloved , and I do n't believe Parham will let her interfere with what he thinks best for the party . Will it pay to put me in the cabinet or not?--that 's what he 'll ask . I shall be strongly backed , too , by most of our papers . "
82166	82167	82066	82066	Ashe	243	" consideration"--to
82256	82267	82252	82252	she	243	" William ! Ah!--I did n't know mother was here . "
82282	82320	82268	82268	She	243	" Good - morning . William , I just came to tell you that I may be late for dinner , so perhaps you had better dine at the House . I am going on the river . "
82321	82325	82327	82327	Ashe	243	" Are you ? "
82334	82339	82327	82327	Ashe	243	" Wish I was . "
82340	82350	82352	82352	Elizabeth	365	" Are you going with the Crashaw 's party ? "
82354	82361	82352	82352	Elizabeth	365	" I know they have one . "
82362	82369	82371	82371	Kitty	243	" Oh , dear , no ! "
82373	82389	82371	82371	Kitty	243	" I hate a crowd on the river . I am going with Geoffrey Cliffe . "
82411	82414	82404	82404	she	222	" Alone ? "
82415	82420	82422	82422	Kitty	243	" _ Naturellement _ ! "
82424	82457	82422	82422	Kitty	243	" He reads me French poetry , and we talk French . We let Madeleine Alcot come once , but her accent was so shocking that Geoffrey would n't have her again ! "
82464	82466	82463	82465	The " Geoffrey	252	" Geoffrey "

82628	82668	82605	82605	He	626	" Do n't be late , Kitty -- or I shall be nervous . I do n't trust Cliffe on the river . And please make it a rule that , in locks , he stops quoting French poetry . "
82681	82688	82689	82689	she	243	" He is an excellent oar , "
82694	82706	82707	82707	Ashe	243	" Is he ? At Oxford we tried him for the Torpids-- "
82887	82890	82893	82893	she	243	" Faust , "
84497	84505	84476	84476	he	219	" Ashe did n't care a button . "

84783	84793	84794	84794	he	2833	" A bomb - shell , to begin with , "
84797	84804	84794	84794	he	2833	" otherwise the flattest thing out . "
84805	84810	84812	84812	Ashe	219	" On the contrary , "
84814	84901	84812	84812	Ashe	219	" Parham has shown a wonderful amount of originality . If you and I are taken by surprise , what will the public be ? And they 'll like him all the better -- you'll see . He has shown courage and gone for new men -- that 's what they 'll say . _ Vive _ Parham ! Well , good - bye . Now , please the Lord , we shall get off -- and I may be among the grouse this day week . "
85096	85117	85087	85087	her	630	" I think I wo n't come round to - night . But expect me first thing to - morrow . "

85824	85831	85832	85832	he	219	" What has happened to them ? "

86279	86289	86274	86274	he	219	" Can I have an answer to this note ? "
86290	86337	86276	86277	the butler	634	" Mrs. Alcot has been in her room since yesterday morning , sir . She was taken ill just before the coach was coming round , and the horses had to be sent back . But the doctor last night hoped it would be nothing serious . "
86485	86488	86489	86489	She	243	" William ! "
86509	86528	86505	86505	she	243	" William ! I have done nothing wrong -- nothing -- nothing ! William -- look at me ! "

86622	86633	86615	86615	he	219	" It 's cruel to keep me waiting , Kitty . "
86634	86645	86615	86615	he	219	" I sent you a telegram first thing this morning . "
86653	86659	86615	86615	he	219	" I never got it . "
86660	86665	86667	86667	Kitty	243	" Horrid little fiend ! "
86683	86721	86667	86667	Kitty	243	" I gave a boy half a crown this morning to be at the station with it by eight o'clock . And I could n't possibly either write or telegraph last night -- it was too late . "
86722	86727	86729	86729	Ashe	243	" Where were you ? "
86733	86744	86729	86729	Ashe	243	" I went to the Alcots ' this morning , and-- "
86745	86778	86667	86667	Kitty	243	" --the butler told you Madeleine was in bed ? So she is . She was ill yesterday morning . There was no coach and no party . I went with Geoffrey . "
86801	86808	86810	86810	Ashe	243	" Of course I guessed that , "
86812	86892	86779	86779	Kitty	243	" It was Geoffrey brought me the news -- here , just as I was starting to go to the Alcots ' . Then he said he had something to read me -- and it would be delicious to go to Pangbourne -- spend the day on the river -- and come back from Windsor -- at night -- by train . And I had a horrid headache -- and it was so hot -- and you were at the office"--her
86894	86905	86906	86906	She	243	quivered--"and I wanted to hear Geoffrey 's poems -- and so-- "
86940	86954	86935	86935	Ashe	243	" Kitty!--look at me ! That man behaved to you like a villain ? "
86975	86979	86980	86980	she	243	" He did , "
86983	86987	86988	86988	She	243	bitterly--"like a villain . "
87021	87033	87017	87017	she	243	" I suppose you want me to tell you the story ? "
87075	87083	87084	87084	he	2884	" Tell me your part in it , "
87088	87098	87084	87084	he	2884	last--"and as little of that fellow as may be . "
87126	87132	87133	87133	he	2884	" Go on , Kitty ! "
87150	87168	87143	87143	he	2884	courtesy--"I beg your pardon , Kitty , but the sooner we get through with this the better . "
87188	87198	87199	87199	she	243	" I told you I had done nothing vile ! "
87204	87210	87199	87199	she	243	" Did you believe me ? "
87222	87235	87236	87236	he	2884	" Those things are not to be asked between you and me , "
87263	87342	87257	87257	she	243	" The day was -- just like other days . He read me his poems -- in a cool place we found under the bank . I thought he was rather absurd now and then -- and different from what he had been . He talked of our going away -- and his not seeing me -- and how lonely he was . And of course I was awfully sorry for him . But it was all right till-- "
87350	87370	87343	87343	She	243	" You remember the inn near Hamel Weir -- a few miles from Windsor -- that lonely little place . "
87374	87426	87257	87257	she	243	" We dined there . Afterwards we were to row to Windsor and come home by a train about ten . We finished dinner early . By - the - way , there were two other people there -- Lady Edith Manley and her boy . They had rowed down from somewhere-- "
87427	87431	87257	87257	she	243	" Did Lady Edith-- "
87432	87452	87257	87257	she	243	" Yes -- she spoke to me . She was going back to town -- to the Holland House party-- "
87453	87460	87257	87257	she	243	" Where she probably met mother ? "
87461	87467	87469	87469	Kitty	243	" She did meet her ! "
87485	87525	87471	87471	She	243	" Your mother sent round this note to me this morning -- to ask when I should be at home . And Wilson sent word -- There ! Of course I know she thinks I 'm capable of anything . "
87539	87545	87547	87547	Ashe	243	" Go on , please , "
87549	87585	87622	87622	she	243	" We finished dinner early . There was a field behind the inn , and then a wood . We strolled into the wood , and then Geoffrey -- well , he went mad ! He-- "
87599	87609	87611	87611	Ashe	243	" He proposed to you to throw me over ? "
87633	87654	87622	87622	she	243	" Oh ! do n't stand there -- and look at me like that -- I ca n't bear it . "
88372	88377	88378	88378	she	243	" I never slept , "
88383	88397	88401	88401	her	243	" I got up at eight for the first train , and now I feel"--she
88409	88417	88401	88401	her	243	eyes--"as if I should like to die ! "
88424	88460	88418	88418	Ashe	243	" It 's my fault , too , Kitty . I ought to have held you with a stronger hand . I hated quarrelling with you . But -- oh , my dear , my dear-- "
88530	88536	88537	88537	he	2911	" This wo n't do , "
88545	88563	88537	88537	he	2911	" you must have some food and rest . Then we 'll think what shall be done . "
88575	88585	88564	88564	She	243	" Why are n't you at the Foreign Office ? "
88586	88594	88596	88596	his	2911	" I sent a message early . Lawson came"--Lawson
88598	88607	88564	88564	She	243	secretary--"but I must go down in an hour . "
88608	88611	88564	88564	She	243	" William ! "
88633	88636	88637	88637	He	2911	" Yes . "
88642	88650	88564	88564	She	243	" William , is the list out ? "
88651	88654	88612	88612	Kitty	243	" Yes . "
88661	88667	88655	88655	Kitty	243	" Is it all right ? "
88668	88673	88674	88674	he	2911	" I suppose so , "
88679	88686	88674	88674	he	2911	" It does n't affect me . "
88831	88838	88822	88822	she	243	" HE GATHERED HER IN HIS ARMS "
88840	88857	88860	88860	her	243	" Shut the door , William . I have something very important to say to you . "
88915	88928	88907	88907	her	243	" William , we must separate ! You must send me away . "
88932	88938	88929	88929	He	2911	" What do you mean ? "
88939	88960	88907	88907	her	243	" What I say . It is -- it is intolerable -- that I should ruin your life like this . "
88961	88999	88929	88929	He	2911	" Do n't , please , exaggerate , Kitty ! There is no question of ruin . I shall make my way when the time comes , and Lady Parham will have nothing to say to it ! "
89000	89021	88907	88907	her	243	" No ! Nothing will ever go well -- while I 'm there -- like a millstone round your neck . William"--she
89025	89049	88929	88929	He	2911	him--"take my advice -- do it ! I Warned you when you married me . And now you see -- it was true . "
89050	89055	89056	89056	he	2920	" You foolish child , "
89061	89077	89056	89056	he	2920	" do you think I could forget you for an hour , wherever you were ? "
89078	89082	89083	89083	she	2920	" Oh yes , "
89088	89123	89083	89083	she	2920	" I know you would forget me--- if I was n't here . I 'm sure of it . You 're very ambitious , William -- more than you know . You 'll soon care-- "
89124	89185	89186	89186	He	2921	" More for politics than for you ? Another of your delusions , Kitty . Nothing of the sort . Moreover , if you will only let me advise you -- trust your husband a little -- think both for him and yourself . I see nothing either in politics or in our life together that can not be retrieved . "
89410	89415	89416	89416	she	243	" No , no , "
89433	89521	89416	89416	she	243	" it 's all been a -- a horrid mistake . Your mother was quite right . Of course she hated your marrying me -- and now -- now she 'll see what I 've done . I guess perfectly what she 's thinking about me to - day ! And I ca n't help it -- I shall go on -- if you let me stay with you . There 's a twist -- a black drop in me . I 'm not like other people . "
89535	89544	89545	89545	he	2925	" You poor , tired , starved child , "
89553	89569	89545	89545	he	2925	" Put your arms round my neck . Let me carry you up - stairs . "
89633	89645	89626	89626	he	2925	" I 'm glad you 're not Polly Lyster , darling ! "
89674	89681	89683	89683	Kitty	243	" It 's all very well , "
89693	89704	89683	89683	Kitty	243	" but we 're _ none _ of us feathers ! "
89724	89740	89741	89741	She	243	" You look horribly tired . What -- what did you do -- last night ? "
89747	89778	89741	89741	She	243	" I sat up reading -- then went to sleep down - stairs . I thought the coach had come to grief , and you were somewhere with the Alcots . "
89779	89786	89787	89787	she	243	" If I had known that , "
89790	89817	89787	89787	she	243	" _ I _ might have gone to sleep . Oh , it was so horrible -- the little stuffy room , and the dirty blankets . "
89825	89875	89818	89818	She	243	" There was a poor baby , too , with whooping - cough . Lucky I had some money . I gave the woman a sovereign . But she was n't at all nice -- she never smiled once . I know she thought I was a bad lot . "
89881	89885	89886	89886	She	243	" Sit there ! "
89899	89905	89886	89886	She	243	" When did you know ? "
89906	89945	89897	89897	her	243	" About the ministry ? Between six and seven . I saw Lady Parham afterwards driving in St. James 's Street . She never enjoyed anything so much in her life as the bow she gave me . ' "
89961	89967	89946	89946	Kitty	243	" Tell me the names . "
90079	90092	90094	90094	Kitty	243	" We had an accident on the river last night , Blanche , "
90096	90113	90094	90094	Kitty	243	" Come back in half an hour . I 'm too tired to change just yet . "
90137	90142	90143	90143	she	243	" I hate lying ! "

90313	90318	90319	90319	she	243	" Put it down , "
90346	90356	90329	90329	she	243	" William!--I have been a horrible wife to you ! "
90357	90390	90329	90329	she	243	" Do n't be a goose , Kitty . You know very well that -- till this last business -- And do n't imagine that I feel myself a model , either ! "
90391	90394	90395	90395	she	243	" No , "
90403	90414	90395	90395	she	243	" Of course , you ought to have beaten me . "
90423	90431	90395	90395	she	243	" Perhaps I might still try it . "
90437	90449	90432	90432	She	243	" Too late . I am not a child any more . "
90507	90519	90492	90492	she	243	" Let me go and live at Haggart , baby and I. "

90540	90574	90492	90492	she	243	" You can come and see me sometimes . I 'll garden -- and write books . Half the smart women I know write stories -- or plays . Why should n't I ? "
90575	90593	90492	90492	she	243	" Why , indeed ? Meanwhile , madam , I take you to Scotland -- next week . "
90594	90597	90598	90598	She	243	" Scotland ? "
90606	90618	90598	90598	She	243	" ' Anywhere -- anywhere -- out of the world ! ' "
90619	90622	90628	90628	her	243	" Kitty ! "

90644	90651	90652	90652	She	243	" That man ? Do I ? "
90659	90690	90652	90652	She	243	" I loathe him ! When I think of yesterday , I could drown myself . If I could pile the whole world between him and me -- I would . But"--she
90691	90699	90733	90733	she	243	shivered--"but yet -- if he were sitting there-- "
90700	90710	90712	90712	Ashe	243	" You would be once more under the spell ? "
90716	90719	90720	90720	she	243	" Spell ! "
90746	90751	90752	90752	she	243	" I warned you , "
90753	90757	90733	90733	she	243	said--"I warned you . "
90758	90772	90752	90752	she	243	" A man does n't pay much attention to those warnings , Kitty . "
90773	90791	90792	90792	she	243	" Then it is not my fault . I do n't know what 's wrong with me , "
90797	90868	90792	90792	she	243	" but I remember saying to you that sometimes my brain was on fire . I seem to be always in a hurry -- in a desperate , desperate hurry!--to know or to feel something -- while there is still time -- before one dies . There is always a passion -- always an effort . More life--_more life_!--even if it lead to pain -- and agony -- and tears . "
90944	90947	90934	90934	she	243	" Tempest . "

91016	91043	91005	91005	he	2943	" ' More _ light _ , ' Kitty , was what Goethe said , in dying . A better prayer , do n't you think ? "
91075	91086	91087	91087	she	243	" That 's the prayer of the _ calm _ , "
91094	91118	91087	91087	she	243	" and my nature is hunger and storm . And Geoffrey Cliffe is the same . That 's why I could n't help being-- "
91123	91149	91119	91119	She	243	" William , do n't let 's talk nonsense . I ca n't ever see that man again . How 's it to be done ? "
91174	91182	91183	91183	he	2943	" For the present , fear nothing , "
91188	91230	91183	91183	he	2943	" For his own sake Cliffe will hold his tongue and leave London . And as to the future -- I can get some message conveyed to him -- by a man he wo n't disregard . Leave it to me . "
91231	91241	91243	91243	Kitty	243	" You ca n't write to him , William ! "
91247	91253	91254	91254	he	2943	" Leave it to me , "
91257	91277	91254	91254	he	2943	" Then suppose you take the boy -- and Margaret French -- to Haggart till I can join you ? "
91278	91283	91284	91284	she	243	" And your mother ? "
91302	91309	91325	91325	her	243	" Leave that also to me . "
91310	91320	91321	91321	she	243	" How she 'll hate the sight of me , "

91346	91366	91325	91325	her	243	" Six months , perhaps -- perhaps less . I do n't see how they can last beyond February . "
91367	91376	91378	91378	Kitty	243	" And then -- we'll _ fight _ ! "
91393	91414	91415	91415	He	2943	" Allow me , please , to command the forces ! Well , now then , I must be off ! "
91426	91435	91378	91378	Kitty	243	" Did you have any breakfast , William ? "
91436	91442	91415	91415	He	2943	" I do n't remember . "

Something seemed to have gone wrong with the Alcots ' coach , and they were somehow divided from all their party . I ca n't remember exactly what it was they said , but Mr. Cliffe was confident they would catch their train .

93599	93619	93554	93554	he	246	" --The wonder is , in Johnsonian phrase , that she should do it at all . Anything else ? "
93620	93633	93586	93587	Mrs. Alcot	363	" I understand -- she is writing a book -- a novel . "
93645	93652	93653	93653	he	246	" Il ne manquait que cela , "
93654	93662	93554	93554	he	246	said--"that Lady Kitty should take to literature ! "
93671	93687	93663	93664	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Why not ? We frivolous people are a good deal cleverer than you think . "
93707	93716	93702	93702	Darrell	246	" No need to remind me , madam ! "
93735	93749	93725	93726	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Very soon you will leave us poor professionals no room to live . "
93782	93791	93776	93776	she	363	" Kitty is much disappointed in the village . "
93792	93801	93858	93859	Mrs. Alcot	363	" They are greater brutes than she thought ? "
93802	93848	93776	93776	she	363	" Quite the contrary . There are no poachers -- and no murders . The girls prefer to be married , and the Tranmores give so much away that no one has the smallest excuse for starvation . Kitty gets nothing out of them whatever . "
93849	93857	93858	93859	Mrs. Alcot	363	" In the way of literary material ? "
93862	93882	93858	93859	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Last week she was so discouraged that she was inclined to give up fiction and take to journalism . "
93883	93888	93776	93776	she	363	" Heavens ! Political ? "
93889	93901	93858	93859	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Oh , _ la haute politique _ , of course . "
93902	93926	93776	93776	she	363	" H'm . The wives of cabinet ministers have often inspired articles . I do n't remember an instance of their writing them . "
93927	93936	93858	93859	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Well , Kitty is inclined to try . "
93937	93943	93776	93776	she	363	" With Ashe 's sanction ? "
93944	93955	93957	93957	Alcot	363	" Goodness , no ! But Kitty , as you are aware"--Mrs
93965	93984	93957	93957	Alcot	363	left--"goes her own way . She believes she can be of great service to her husband 's policy . "
93990	94011	93985	93985	Darrell	246	" If you were in Ashe 's position , would you rather your wife neglected or supported your political interests ? "
94018	94029	94012	94013	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Kitty made a considerable mess of them last year . "
94030	94074	94075	94075	His	246	" No doubt . She forgot they existed . But I think if I were Ashe , I should be more afraid of her remembering . By - the - way -- the glass here seems to be at ' Set Fair ' ? "
94107	94110	94112	94113	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Astonishing ! "
94119	94143	94112	94113	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Kitty is immensely proud of him -- and immensely ambitious . That , of course , accounts for Lord Parham 's visit . "
94144	94148	94150	94150	Darrell	246	" Lord Parham ! "
94157	94162	94150	94150	Darrell	246	" Lord Parham!--coming here ? "
94163	94179	94112	94113	Mrs. Alcot	363	" He arrives to - morrow . On his way from Scotland -- to Windsor . "
94207	94215	94150	94150	Darrell	246	" Why , I thought that Lady Kitty-- "
94216	94243	94112	94113	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Had vowed vengeance ? So , in a sense , she has . It is understood that she and Lady Parham do n't meet , except-- "
94244	94256	94258	94258	Darrell	246	" On formal occasions , and to take in the groundlings , "
94269	94293	94258	94258	Darrell	246	" Yes , that I gathered . But you mean that _ Lord _ Parham is to be allowed to make his peace ? "
94301	94312	94294	94295	Madeleine Alcot	361	" Kitty wishes to try her hand at managing him . "
94387	94399	94415	94415	Darrell	246	" Where -- if I may ask -- is the poet ? "
94400	94414	94415	94415	Darrell	246	" Geoffrey ? Somewhere in the Balkans , is n't he?--making a revolution . "
94418	94447	94449	94449	Darrell	246	" I remember . They say he is with the revolutionary committee at Marinitza . Meanwhile there is a new volume of poems out -- to - day , "
94460	94473	94415	94415	Darrell	246	" I have seen it . The ' portrait ' at the end-- "
94474	94479	94480	94480	They	3015	" Is Lady Kitty . "
94486	94492	94494	94494	Kitty	243	" Unmistakable , I think , "
94499	94520	94521	94521	She	3016	" As poetry , it seems to me the best thing in the book , but the audacity of it ! "
94536	94542	94523	94523	her	3016	" Has she seen it ? "
94600	94612	94594	94594	Darrell	246	" I gather that last year some very important person interfered ? "
94749	94755	94757	94757	Darrell	246	" May he stay there ! "
94759	94770	94757	94757	Darrell	246	" Of course , the whole thing was absurdly exaggerated . "
94771	94775	94777	94778	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Was it ? "
94782	94792	94777	94778	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Kitty richly deserved most of what was said . "
94797	94820	94796	94796	his	3025	start--"Don't misunderstand me , of course . If twenty actions for divorce were given against Kitty , I should believe nothing--_nothing _ ! "
94834	94856	94796	94796	his	3025	" But as for the tales that people who hate her tell of her , and will go on telling of her-- "
94857	94869	94777	94778	Mrs. Alcot	363	" They are merely the harvest of what she has sown ? "
94870	94876	94796	94796	his	3025	" Naturally . Poor Kitty ! "
95252	95269	95274	95274	he	246	" By - the - way -- where is Lady Kitty?--and are there many people here ? "
95300	95302	95274	95274	he	246	" grounds "
95345	95357	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Kitty is at the Agricultural Show -- with a party . "
95358	95370	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Playing the great lady ? _ What _ a house ! "
95371	95391	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Yes . Kitty abhors it . But it will do very well for the party to - morrow . "
95392	95402	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Half the county -- that kind of thing ? "
95403	95417	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" _ All _ the county -- some royalties -- and Lord Parham . "
95418	95433	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Lord Parham being the end and aim ? I thought I heard wheels . "
95446	95451	95453	95453	Darrell	246	" And the party ? "
95455	95462	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Not particularly thrilling . Lord Grosville-- "
95463	95474	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Also , I presume , _ en garçon _ . "
95479	95499	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" --the Manleys , Lady Tranmore , Miss French , the Dean of Milford and his wife , Eddie Helston-- "
95500	95513	95475	95476	Mrs. Alcot	363	" That , I understand , is Lady Kitty 's undergraduate adorer ? "
95514	95550	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	" It 's no use talking to you -- you know all the gossip . And some county big - wigs , whose names I ca n't remember -- come to dinner to - night . "
95557	95570	95572	95572	Darrell	246	" I am very curious to see how Ashe takes his triumph , "
95581	95590	95592	95593	Madeleine Alcot	361	" He is just the same . No ! "
95596	95619	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	herself--"no -- not quite . He _ meant _ to triumph , and he _ knows _ that he has done so . "
95620	95625	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	" My dear lady ! "
95627	95648	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	Darrell--"a quite _ enormous _ difference ! Ashe never took stock of himself or his prospects in his life before . "
95649	95666	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Well , now -- you will find he takes stock of a good many things . "
95667	95672	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Including Lady Kitty ? "
95677	95686	95551	95552	Mrs. Alcot	363	" He wo n't let her interfere again . "
95687	95693	95695	95695	Darrell	246	" _ L'homme propose _ , "
95697	95705	95695	95695	Darrell	246	" You mean he has grown ambitious ? "
95794	95799	95801	95801	Darrell	246	" Scarcely his repose ? "
95803	95813	95815	95816	Mrs. Alcot	363	" I really wo n't discuss Kitty any more , "
95820	95835	95815	95816	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Here they are ! Hullo ! What has Kitty got hold of now ? "
95951	95957	95959	95960	Mrs. Alcot	363	" What is the matter ? "
95966	95973	95975	95976	Lord Grosville	265	" Kitty ran over a boy , "
95982	96109	95975	95976	Lord Grosville	265	" The rascal had n't a scratch , but Kitty must needs pick him up and drive him home with a nurse . ' I ai n't hurt , mum , ' says the boy . ' Oh ! but you must be , ' said Kitty . I offered to take him to his mother and give him half a crown . ' It 's my duty to look after him , ' says Kitty . And she lifted him up herself -- dirty little vagabond!--and put him in the carriage . There were some laborers and grooms standing near , and one of them sang out , ' Three cheers for Lady Kitty Ashe ! ' Such a ridiculous scene as you never saw ! "
96118	96126	96128	96131	the amicable Lady Edith	271	" Lady Kitty is always so kind , "
96133	96145	96128	96131	the amicable Lady Edith	271	" But her pretty dress -- I _ was _ sorry ! "
96146	96158	96160	96161	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Oh no -- only an excuse for a new one , "
96178	96184	96186	96186	Ashe	243	" Well , old fellow ! "
96196	96226	96186	96186	Ashe	243	" Uncommonly glad to see you . You look as though that damned London had been squeezing the life out of you . Come for a stroll before dinner ? "
96333	96344	96305	96305	Darrell	246	" One can see what a personage he feels himself ! "
96724	96731	96733	96733	Ashe	243	" Jolly , is n't it ? "
96737	96753	96733	96733	Ashe	243	him--"even this spoiled country ! Why did we go and stifle in that beastly show ! "
96867	96873	96864	96867	the characteristic male gossip--"What	6526	gossip--"What 's ---- doing now ? "

96886	96892	96864	96867	the characteristic male gossip--"What	6526	" You remember that fellow at Univ.?"--and
97214	97246	97164	97165	a woman	5712	beginning--"By - the - way , I wished to consult you about a personal matter . Of course , answer or not , as you like . Naturally , I understand the difficulties!"--the
97315	97330	97303	97303	he	246	" I say , old fellow -- don't -- don't be a damned fool ! "
97360	97375	97353	97353	Ashe	243	" Why , my dear Philip , it would be the extinguishing of you ! "
97396	97404	97380	97380	Ashe	243	" for a man of your gifts , "
97447	97464	97471	97471	Darrell	246	responsibility--"Too bad , is n't it , that a duffer like me should have to decide these things"--and
97589	97600	97602	97602	Ashe	243	" Well , Kitty , how 's the bruised one ? "
97614	97618	97620	97620	Kitty	243	" Doing finely , "
97622	97632	97620	97620	Kitty	243	" I shall send him home to - night . "
97633	97653	97672	97672	gods	3125	" Meanwhile , have you put him up in my dressing - room ? I only ask for information . "
97654	97661	97663	97663	Kitty	243	" There was n't another corner , "
97665	97668	97669	97669	Ashe	243	" There ! "
97676	97687	97669	97669	Ashe	243	" How do you expect me to dress for dinner ? "
97688	97700	97702	97702	Kitty	243	" Oh , now , William , do n't be tiresome ! "
97706	97712	97669	97669	Ashe	243	" He was bruised black and blue"--("Serve
97721	97724	97725	97725	nurse	6137	" grumbled Lord Grosville)--"and

97835	97838	97839	97839	she	243	" Impossible ! "
97846	97860	97862	97862	Ashe	243	" I 'll go and talk to Wilson ; he 'll manage it , "
97901	97907	97909	97910	Mrs. Alcot	363	" You see the difference , "
97917	97933	97909	97910	Mrs. Alcot	363	" Last year Kitty would have got her way . This year she wo n't . "
97939	97954	97934	97934	Darrell	246	" These domesticities should be kept out of sight , do n't you think ? "
97962	97970	97971	97971	she	361	" Did you have a pleasant walk ? "
97980	97987	97974	97974	Darrell	246	" The great man was condescending . "
97996	98007	97988	97989	Madeleine Alcot	361	" A touch of the _ folie des grandeurs ? _ "
98008	98015	98017	98017	Darrell	246	" Well , who escapes it ? "
98653	98656	98643	98643	she	341	" Margaret ! "
98677	98684	98663	98663	She	341	" Have you seen the babe ? "

98986	98999	98980	98981	Lady Tranmore	222	" I think -- partly -- he is tired with the heat . "
99005	99009	99010	99010	she	243	" Take him ! "

100660	100664	100649	100649	Ashe	243	said--"don't touch it ! "

100783	100789	100757	100757	Kitty	243	" It is n't there . "
100790	100814	100815	100815	He	265	" Ah ! I see . You 've topped the pile with it . With your leave , I 'll delay its doom . "
100917	100953	100901	100901	he	265	" Wretched stuff , and damned impertinence!--that 's all there is to say . For Heaven 's sake , Kitty , do n't let any one suppose you mind the thing -- for an instant ! "

102213	102219	102193	102193	Kitty	243	" About your literary work ? "
102227	102244	102220	102220	She	243	" Do you know ? How do you know ? I have been writing a book ! "
102245	102249	102220	102220	She	243	" So I imagined-- "
102250	102254	102255	102255	She	243	" And -- and-- "
102264	102283	102255	102255	She	243	" I want you to help me get it published . It is a deadly secret . Nobody knows-- "
102284	102289	102220	102220	She	243	" Not even William ? "
102290	102294	102295	102295	she	243	" No one , "
102298	102323	102295	102295	she	243	" And I ca n't tell you about it , or show you a line of it , unless you vow and swear to me-- "
102324	102330	102332	102332	Darrell	246	" Oh ! I swear , "
102334	102337	102332	102332	Darrell	246	tranquilly--"I swear . "
102349	102383	102338	102338	Kitty	243	" I have written it at all sorts of times -- when William was away -- in the middle of the night -- out in the woods . _ Nobody _ knows . You see"--her
102389	102413	102338	102338	Kitty	243	moss--"I have a good many advantages . If people want ' Society ' with a big S , I can give it them ! "
102414	102417	102419	102419	Darrell	246	" Naturally , "
102421	102431	102442	102442	him	246	" And it always amuses people -- doesn't it ? "
102446	102450	102452	102452	Darrell	246	" Does it ? "
102454	102463	102452	102452	Darrell	246	" It has been done a good deal . "
102464	102470	102472	102472	Kitty	243	" Oh , of course , "
102476	102516	102472	102472	Kitty	243	" mine 's not the proper thing . You do n't imagine I should try and write like Thackeray , do you ? Mine 's _ real _ people--_real _ things that happened -- with just the names altered . "
102517	102520	102522	102522	Darrell	246	" Ah ! "
102525	102533	102472	102472	Kitty	243	up--"that sounds exciting . Is it libellous ? "
102534	102546	102548	102548	Kitty	243	" Well , that 's just what I want to know , "
102552	102587	102548	102548	Kitty	243	" Of course , I 've made a kind of story out of it . But you 'd have to be a great fool not to guess . I 've put myself in , and-- "
102588	102592	102472	102472	Kitty	243	" And Ashe ? "
102596	102631	102634	102634	her	243	" All the novels that are written about politics nowadays -- except Dizzy's -- are such nonsense , are n't they ? I just wanted to describe -- from the inside -- how a real statesman"--she
102636	102643	102548	102548	Kitty	243	proudly--"lives , and what he does . "
102644	102648	102650	102650	Darrell	246	" Excellent subject , "
102652	102658	102650	102650	Darrell	246	" Well -- anybody else ? "
102662	102667	102668	102668	she	243	" You 'll see , "
102690	102695	102696	102696	he	246	" May I look ? "
103026	103029	103030	103030	He	246	" Well ! "
103072	103077	103099	103099	herself	243	" And Lord Parham ? "
103088	103093	103094	103094	she	243	" That 'll come , "
103143	103146	103148	103148	Kitty	243	" Well ! "
103150	103160	103148	103148	Kitty	243	impatiently--"what do you think ? Can you help me ? "
103165	103186	103161	103161	Darrell	246	" You know , Lady Kitty , that book ca n't be published like that . Nobody would risk it . "
103187	103201	103161	103161	Darrell	246	" Well , I suppose they 'll tell me what to cut out . "
103202	103205	103207	103207	Darrell	246	" Yes , "
103214	103248	103161	103161	Darrell	246	reflections--"no doubt some clever fellow will know how near the wind it 's possible to sail . But , anyway , trim it as you like , the book will make a scandal . "
103249	103253	103254	103254	Kitty	243	" Will it ? "
103270	103276	103277	103277	he	246	" I do n't see , "
103280	103290	103277	103277	he	246	" how you can publish it without consulting Ashe . "
103298	103377	103378	103378	She	243	" No , no , _ no _ ! Of course he 'd disapprove . But then -- he soon forgives a thing , if he thinks it clever . And it is clever , is n't it?--some of it . He 'd laugh -- and then it would be all right . _ He 'd _ never pay out his enemies , but he could n't help enjoying it if some one else did -- could he ? "
103384	103393	103395	103395	Darrell	246	" ' No need to forgive them , ' "
103410	103420	103398	103398	he	246	eyes--"for you would have ' shot them all . ' "
103568	103574	103576	103576	himself	246	" Now tell me , Lady Kitty"--he
103583	103591	103576	103576	himself	246	attention--"what do you want me to do ? "
103592	103599	103602	103602	him	3270	" To find me a publisher , and"--she
103606	103612	103602	103602	him	3270	shyness--"to get me some money . "
103613	103616	103576	103576	himself	246	" Money ! "
103617	103626	103628	103628	Kitty	243	" I 've been so awfully extravagant lately , "
103632	103653	103628	103628	Kitty	243	" Something really will have to be done . And the book 's worth some money , is n't it ? "
103654	103659	103661	103661	Darrell	246	" A good deal , "
103668	103683	103664	103664	he	246	emphasis--"I really ca n't be responsible for it in any way , Lady Kitty . "
103684	103733	103664	103664	he	246	" Of course not . I will never , _ never _ say I told you ! But , you see , I 'm not literary -- I do n't know in the least how to set about it . If you would just put me in communication ? "
103792	103800	103801	103801	he	246	" I am bound to warn you , "
103810	103829	103801	103801	he	246	" that your husband will probably strongly disapprove this book , and that it may do him harm . "
103835	103850	103830	103830	Kitty	243	" But if I tell nobody who wrote it -- and you tell nobody ? "
103851	103862	103801	103801	he	246	" Ashe would know at once . Everybody would know . "
103863	103868	103830	103830	Kitty	243	" William would know , "
103875	103902	103830	103830	Kitty	243	" But I do n't see why anybody else should . You see , I 've put myself in -- I've said the most shocking things ! "
103918	103931	103903	103903	Darrell	246	" However -- I can no doubt get an opinion for you . "
103941	103959	103960	103960	she	243	" You shall have the whole of it before you go -- Friday , is n't it ? "
104192	104200	104185	104185	Ashe	243	" Tu l'as voulu , Georges Dandin ! "
104480	104483	104485	104486	the Premier	2809	" Ah ! "
104490	104499	104489	104489	he	2809	approached--"now for the tare in Ashe 's wheat ! "
104688	104696	104703	104703	she	243	" He has been reading the Bible , "
104707	104732	104733	104733	She	243	" Just now he 's in the Acts . That 's why , I suppose , he did n't hear the carriage . John ! "
104738	104748	104735	104736	a footman	749	" Tell Mr. Ashe that Lord Parham has arrived ! "
104755	104766	104749	104750	The Premier	2809	" Does Ashe generally study the Scriptures of an afternoon ? "
104776	104782	104784	104784	her	243	" When he can . He says"--she
104789	104800	104784	104784	her	243	whisper--"the Bible is such a ' d----d interesting ' book ! "
104920	104923	104915	104915	Kitty	243	" went on cutting"--or
104927	104933	104915	104915	Kitty	243	" bread - and - butter "
104942	104948	104949	104949	he	231	" What a charming house ! "
105270	105289	105291	105292	Lord Parham	231	" No one , of course , can keep any count of what he says on these occasions , "
105299	105306	105291	105292	Lord Parham	231	" I hope I talked some sense-- "
105307	105313	105315	105315	Kitty	243	" Oh , but why ? "
105330	105333	105335	105336	Lord Parham	231	" Why ? "
105341	105351	105335	105336	Lord Parham	231	" I do n't follow you , Lady Kitty . "
105352	105358	105360	105360	Kitty	243	" Anybody can talk sense ! "
105373	105386	105360	105360	Kitty	243	" It 's the other thing that 's hard -- isn't it ? "
105387	105391	105393	105394	the Dean	987	" Lady Kitty , "
105400	105408	105393	105394	the Dean	987	" you are plagiarizing from Mr. Pitt . "
105409	105413	105415	105415	Kitty	243	" Am I ? "
105417	105423	105415	105415	Kitty	243	" I did n't know . "
105424	105434	105436	105437	Lord Parham	231	" I imagine that Mr. Pitt talked sense sometimes , "
105441	105451	105453	105453	Kitty	243	" Ah , that was when he was drunk ! "
105455	105462	105453	105453	Kitty	243	" Then he was n't responsible . "
105482	105491	105453	105453	Kitty	243	" So you worship nonsense , Lady Kitty ? "
105496	105508	105492	105492	Kitty	243	" And so does William . Ah , here he is ! "
105527	105547	105492	105492	Kitty	243	" Upon my word , Ashe , how well you look ! _ You _ have had some holiday ! "
105548	105559	105561	105561	Ashe	243	" Which is more than can be said of yourself , "
105567	105585	105561	105561	Ashe	243	" Well!--how have the speeches gone ? Is there anything left of you ? Edinburgh was magnificent ! "
105648	105692	105631	105632	The Premier	2809	" Oh ! my dear fellow , people were very kind -- too much so ! Yes -- I think it did good -- it did good . I should now rest and be thankful -- if it were n't for the Bishops ! "
105693	105697	105699	105705	the Rector of the parish standing near	3330	" The Bishops ! "
105707	105718	105699	105705	the Rector of the parish standing near	3330	" What have the Bishops been doing , my lord ? "
105719	105722	105724	105724	Kitty	243	" Dying , "
105740	105747	105727	105727	she	243	" They do it on purpose . "
105748	105753	105755	105755	Ashe	243	" Another this morning ! "
105762	105771	105773	105775	the Prime Minister	632	" Oh ! they die to plague me , "
105789	105797	105773	105775	the Prime Minister	632	" There never was such a conspiracy ! "
105798	105806	105808	105808	Kitty	243	" You should let William appoint them , "
105842	105849	105851	105852	Lord Parham	231	" Ah , to be sure ! "
105856	105873	105874	105874	he	231	" I had forgotten that Ashe was our theologian . Take me a walk before dinner ! "
105881	105890	105892	105892	Kitty	243	" But you wo n't take his advice , "
105902	105912	105896	105897	The Premier	2809	" How do you know that , Lady Kitty ? "
105926	105939	105913	105913	Kitty	243	" Lady Parham has such strong views -- hasn't she?--on Church questions ! "
105963	105990	105958	105958	He	231	" If she has , Lady Kitty , I can only say I know very little about them ! She very wisely keeps them to herself . "
105991	105994	105996	105996	Kitty	243	" Ah ! "
106004	106012	105996	105996	Kitty	243	" that shows how little people know . "
106013	106020	106022	106023	Lord Parham	231	" I do n't quite understand , "
106025	106035	106022	106023	Lord Parham	231	" To what do you allude , Lady Kitty ? "
106060	106078	106041	106041	her	243	" Some one -- said to me last week -- that Lady Parham had saved the Church ! "
106084	106103	106079	106081	The Prime Minister	632	" I must have a little exercise before dinner . Your gardens , Ashe -- is there time ? "
106239	106248	106249	106249	he	277	" Lady Kitty , do you ever rest ? "
106255	106258	106259	106259	she	243	" Rest ! "
106262	106267	106259	106259	she	243	" Why should I ? "
106268	106276	106249	106249	he	277	" Because you are wearing yourself out . "
106282	106296	106298	106299	the Dean	987	" Do you ever lie down -- alone -- and read a book ? "
106301	106316	106259	106259	she	243	" Yes . I have just finished Renan 's _ Vie de Jésus _ ! "
106339	106351	106353	106354	the Dean	987	" Ah ! my dear Lady Kitty , let Renan alone , "
106361	106370	106353	106354	the Dean	987	tone--"but are you speaking truth -- or naughtiness ? "
106371	106374	106376	106376	Kitty	243	" Truth , "
106378	106390	106376	106376	Kitty	243	" But -- of course -- I am in a temper . "
106395	106407	106391	106392	The Dean	277	" I see Lord Parham is not a favorite of yours . "
106414	106429	106430	106430	she	243	" To think that William should have to take his orders from that man ! "
106437	106446	106448	106449	the Dean	987	" Bear it -- for William 's sake , "
106453	106470	106448	106449	the Dean	987	" and , meanwhile -- take my advice -- and do n't read any more Renan ! "
106477	106487	106471	106471	Kitty	243	" I prefer to see things as they are . "
106492	106543	106488	106489	The Dean	277	" That none of us can do , my dear Lady Kitty . No one can satisfy his _ intelligence _ . But religion speaks to the _ will_--and it is the only thing between us and the void . Do n't tamper with it ! It is soon gone . "
106555	106571	106488	106489	The Dean	277	" Mine was gone before we had been a month married . William killed it . "
106576	106587	106572	106573	The Dean	987	" I hear always of his interest in religious matters ! "
106588	106627	106488	106489	The Dean	277	" He cares for nothing so much -- and he does n't believe one single word of anything ! I was brought up in a convent , you know -- but William laughed it all out of me . "
106628	106633	106572	106573	The Dean	987	" Dear Lady Kitty ! "
106637	106662	106663	106663	she	366	" And now , of course , I know there 's nothing in it . Oh ! I _ do _ beg your pardon ! "
106668	106686	106663	106663	she	366	" I never meant to say anything rude to _ you . _ And I must go ! "
106743	106750	106752	106753	the Dean	987	" Poor child , poor child ! "
106795	106802	106803	106803	she	341	" He seems to lose strength , "
106808	106818	106803	106803	she	341	" The doctor declares there is no danger , unless-- "
106819	106823	106792	106792	Margaret	341	" Unless what ? "
106824	106833	106835	106835	her	341	" Oh ! but it 's so unlikely ! "
106839	106848	106835	106835	her	341	" Do n't let 's think of it . "
106909	106915	106916	106916	He	219	" Kitty -- one word ! "
106940	107010	106927	106927	he	219	" Kitty , do be nice to that old fellow to - night ! It 's only for two nights . Take him in the right way , and make a conquest of him -- for good . He 's been very decent to me in our walk -- though you did say such extraordinary things to him this afternoon . I believe he really wants to make amends . "
107011	107020	107022	107022	Kitty	366	" I do hate his white eyelashes so , "
107026	107032	107034	107034	Ashe	219	" What does it matter , "
107038	107080	107034	107034	Ashe	219	" whether he were a blue - faced baboon!--for two nights ? Just listen to him a little , Kitty -- that 's all he wants . And -- don't be offended!--but hold your own small tongue -- just a little ! "
107086	107095	107096	107096	she	366	" I believe I shall do something dreadful , "
107121	107163	107096	107096	she	366	" Why should you do anything dreadful , please ? Lord Parham is your guest , and my political chief . Is there any woman in England who would not do her best to be civil to him under the circumstances ? "
107164	107169	107171	107171	Kitty	366	" I suppose not , "
107176	107187	107171	107171	Kitty	366	" No , I do n't think there can be . "
107188	107191	107096	107096	she	366	" Kitty ! "

107273	107310	107263	107263	Ashe	219	" But please understand , it would be _ infinitely _ better if you would help me , in _ my _ way -- in the natural , accepted way -- the way that everybody understands . "

107433	107455	107426	107426	she	366	" Why is he here ? Why have we people dining ? We ought to be alone -- in the dark ! "

107599	107659	107565	107565	her	366	reproachfully--"tell me _ why _ you think them . Confide in me , Kitty . Come and talk to me about the boy . But three - fourths of the time you behave as though there were nothing the matter with him -- you wo n't even see the doctor -- and then you say a thing like this ! "
107712	107721	107722	107722	Ashe	219	" Kitty , why did you say that ? "
107727	107748	107749	107749	Ashe	219	" I do n't know . At least , I could n't explain . Now , shall we go down ? "

110835	110866	110832	110832	he	231	" but they are damned little good to us -- it is the Tories who have the men ! Ye gods ! must we all talk like this at last ? "

111144	111154	111134	111134	Ashe	243	" it seems to have dropped from my portfolio . "

111817	111845	111813	111813	Ashe	243	" I ought to know where I am with Lord Parham . He is clearly bitterly offended -- by something , and I shall have to apologize . "

111892	111901	111886	111886	she	243	" How did you know I wrote it ? "
111902	111912	111913	111913	He	3505	" I saw you write it and throw it . "
111951	111963	111943	111943	Ashe	243	" That game , Kitty , was hardly worth the candle ! "
111964	111998	111919	111919	Kitty	243	" It was a perfectly harmless remark -- and only meant for Eddie ! Any one else than Lord Parham would have laughed . _ Then _ I might have begged his pardon . "
111999	112009	112011	112011	Ashe	243	" It is what you ought to do now , "
112013	112028	112011	112011	Ashe	243	" A little note from you , Kitty -- you could write it to perfection-- "
112029	112033	112035	112035	Kitty	243	" Certainly not , "
112045	112056	112057	112057	he	3505	" You prefer to have failed in hospitality and manners , "
112062	112088	112057	112057	he	3505	" Well , I 'm afraid if you do n't feel any disgrace in it I do . Lord Parham in our _ guest _ ! "

112161	112181	112102	112102	Kitty	243	" I do n't know what you mean , Kitty -- but we must n't stay arguing here any longer-- "
112182	112211	112102	112102	Kitty	243	" No!--but -- don't you remember ? I told you , you can always send me away . Then I should n't be putting spokes in your wheel . "
112212	112218	112220	112220	Ashe	243	" I do n't deny , "
112224	112270	112220	112220	Ashe	243	" it might be wisest if , next spring , you stayed here , for part at least of the session -- or abroad . It is certainly difficult carrying on politics under these conditions . I could , of course , come backward and forward-- "
112291	112307	112286	112286	she	243	" Very well . That would be a kind of separation , would n't it ? "
112308	112326	112328	112328	Ashe	243	" There would be no need to call it by any such name . Oh ! Kitty ! "
112330	112341	112328	112328	Ashe	243	" why ca n't you behave like a reasonable woman ? "

113289	113294	113296	113296	Kitty	243	" No , no ! "
113309	113316	113296	113296	Kitty	243	" I must see what happens ! "

113560	113569	113553	113555	Lady Edith Manley	271	" It makes even this house look romantic . "
113795	113820	113788	113789	The Dean	987	" What a pity ! This once held a statue of Hebe holding a torch . It was struck by lightning fifty years ago . "
113821	113832	113834	113835	Edith Manley	271	" Lady Kitty might stand for her to - night , "

113952	113994	113995	113995	She	243	" They 're _ all _ gone ! The Bishop wishes me to become a vice - president of the Women 's Diocesan Association . And I 've promised three curates to open bazaars . _ Ah , mon Dieu ! _ "

We love you too well , and we want a bit of you left for to - morrow . Never mind ! You offered us a dance -- you bring us a vision -- and a poem!--Friends ! "
114821	114882	114883	114883	He	277	" Friends ! you see this pedestal . Once Hebe , the cup - bearer of the gods , stood there . Then -- ungrateful Zeus smote her , and she fell ! But the Hours and the Graces bore her safe away , into a golden land , and now they bring her back again . Behold her!--Hebe reborn ! "

115298	115362	115296	115296	Kitty	243	" I must reply , must n't I ? ( Keep back , William!--I'm all right . ) Hebe thanks you , please--_mille fois _ ! She herself has n't been happy -- and she 's afraid she has n't been good ! _ N'importe ! _ It 's all done -- and finished . The play 's over!--and the lights go out ! "

117773	117798	117769	117769	Kitty	243	" I got your letter -- thank you very much . Where are you staying ? We 've got rooms on the Grand Canal . "
117799	117806	117808	117808	Madame	347	" Oh , but , Kitty ! "
117809	117816	117769	117769	Kitty	243	d'Estrées--"I was so sorry for you ! "
117817	117821	117823	117823	Kitty	243	" Were you ? "
117829	117842	117823	117823	Kitty	243	" Then , please , never speak of him to me again ! "
117874	117884	117871	117872	a mother	3709	" You 're _ dreadfully _ thin , Kitty ! "
117890	117897	117898	117898	she	243	" It 's not my fault , "
117903	117938	117898	117898	she	243	" I live on cream , and it 's no good . Of course , I know I 'm an object and a scarecrow ; but I 'd rather people did n't tell me . "
117939	117957	117871	117872	a mother	3709	" What nonsense , _ chére enfant ! _ You 're much prettier than you ever were . "
117970	117974	117976	117976	Kitty	243	" Am I ? "
117980	117999	117976	117976	Kitty	243	" That 's all right ! If I had died it would n't matter , of course . But-- "
118000	118010	118012	118012	Madame	347	" Died ! What do you mean , Kitty ? "
118018	118033	118012	118012	Madame	347	" When William wrote to me I thought he meant you had overtired yourself . "
118034	118048	118050	118050	Kitty	243	" Oh , well , the doctors said it was touch and go , "
118054	118095	118050	118050	Kitty	243	" But , of course , it was n't . I 'm much too tough . And then they fussed about one 's heart . And that 's all nonsense , too . I could n't die if I tried . "
118269	118276	118262	118262	she	347	" Are you coming , Markham ? "
118299	118303	118305	118306	Madame d'Estrées	690	" A casa ! "
118502	118510	118512	118512	Ashe	243	" This does you good , darling ! "
118552	118564	118537	118537	Kitty	243	" Who could ever have thought we should find maman here ! "
118565	118574	118576	118576	Ashe	243	" Do n't have her on your mind ! "
118582	118591	118576	118576	Ashe	243	" I ca n't have anything worrying you . "
118599	118622	118592	118592	She	914	" Is that man going to marry her -- at last ? She called him ' Markham . ' That 's new . "
118623	118629	118631	118631	Ashe	243	" Looks rather like it , "
118633	118646	118631	118631	Ashe	243	" Then _ he 'll _ have to look after the debts ! "
118943	118949	118951	118951	Ashe	243	" But she 's dead , "
118953	118984	118951	118951	Ashe	243	" I remember noticing her death in the _ Times _ some three months ago . That , of course , explains it . Now he 's free to marry . "
118985	118999	119001	119001	Kitty	243	" And so maman will settle down , and be happy ever afterwards ! "
119011	119018	119001	119001	Kitty	243	" Why should anybody be good ? "
119053	119066	119067	119067	He	522	" Were you very unhappy when you were a child , Kitty ? "
119074	119077	119079	119079	Kitty	243	" No , "
119083	119113	119079	119079	Kitty	243	" I 'm too like maman . I suppose , really , at bottom , I liked all the debts , and the excitement , and the shady people ! "
119114	119132	119134	119134	Ashe	243	" That was n't the impression you gave me , in the first days of our acquaintance ! "
119138	119163	119164	119164	she	243	" Oh , then I was grown up -- and there were drawbacks . But I 'm made of the same stuff as maman , "
119167	119187	119164	119164	she	243	obstinately--"except that I ca n't tell so many fibs . That 's really why we did n't get on . "
119264	119272	119274	119274	Kitty	243	" How strange to find her here ! "
119280	119293	119274	119274	Kitty	243	" Now , if it had been Alice -- my sister Alice ! "
119374	119386	119367	119367	Ashe	243	" You have done too much , Kitty -- as usual ! "
119398	119416	119393	119393	She	243	" What does it matter ? You know very well it would be much better for you if-- "
119417	119421	119387	119387	His	3753	" If what ? "
119422	119428	119393	119393	She	243	" If I followed Harry . "
119457	119474	119443	119443	Ashe	243	" Are you quite determined I sha'n't get _ any _ joy out of my holiday ? "
119526	119532	119533	119533	he	3753	" It is her illness , "
119538	119546	119533	119533	he	3753	" and the loss of the child . "

121484	121494	121495	121495	she	243	" I can be a lady when I choose , "
121503	121511	121495	121495	she	243	" I was n't even a lady . "
121595	121650	121573	121573	William	219	" But it 's only because he 's so terribly sorry for me . It 's all quite different . And I ca n't ever make him love me again in the old way .... It was n't my fault . It 's something born in me -- that catches me by the throat . "

122274	122309	122267	122267	she	243	" Do n't look at me so -- so unkindly . I know you do n't want to see me . Why -- why should we speak at all ? I 'm going away . "
122330	122346	122319	122320	Alice Wensleydale	288	" No ! stay a moment . You are in black . You look ill . "

122389	122407	122385	122386	Lady Alice	288	" I had n't heard . I 'm very sorry for you . How old was he ? "

122441	122457	122458	122459	Lady Alice	288	" No -- and I do n't want them . They might die , too . "
122526	122531	122532	122532	she	288	" How are you ? "
122537	122551	122532	122532	she	288	" I often think of you . Are you happy in your marriage ? "

122942	122953	122955	122956	Alice Wensleydale	288	" I do n't know what you mean by that , "
122960	122981	122955	122956	Alice Wensleydale	288	" If you do n't help him you 'll be sorry -- when it 's too late to be sorry . "
122982	122988	122990	122990	Kitty	243	" Oh , I know ! "
122997	123007	123008	123008	She	243	" I must go in . Good - night . "

123749	123904	123746	123746	Madame	347	" Darling Kitty,--Will you join us to - night in an expedition ? You know that Princess Margherita is staying on the Grand Canal?--in one of the Mocenigo palaces . There is to be a serenata in her honor to - night -- not one of those vulgar affairs which the hotels get up , but really good music and fine voices -- money to be given to some hospital or other . Do come with us . I suppose you have your own gondola , as we have . The gondolas who wish to follow meet at the Piazzetta , weather permitting , eight o'clock . I know , of course , that you are not going out . But this is _ only _ music!--and for a charity . One just sits in one 's gondola , and follows the music up the canal . Send word by bearer . Your fond mother ,
123905	123909	123930	123930	Her	243	" Marguerite d'Estrées . "
123918	123929	123910	123910	Kitty	243	" Are n't you dining out somewhere to - night ? "
123995	124022	124023	124023	he	3876	" But I can throw it over in a moment , if you want me . I came to Venice for _ you _ , darling , "
124044	124077	124023	124023	he	3876	" No , no ! Go and dine with your prince . I 'll go with maman -- Margaret and I. At least , Margaret must , of course , please herself ! "
124087	124110	124078	124078	She	243	" Maman 's probably in the pink of society here . Venice does n't take its cue from people like Aunt Lina ! "
124166	124171	124172	124172	she	243	" You never tell me-- "
124177	124186	124172	124172	she	243	" Did she really do such dreadful things ? "
124187	124195	124158	124158	Kitty	243	" My dear Kitty!--why talk about it ? "
124212	124240	124172	124172	she	243	" What does it matter ? It 's all so long ago . I have nothing to do with what I did ten years ago -- nothing ! "
124241	124246	124248	124248	Ashe	243	" A convenient doctrine ! "
124250	124272	124248	124248	Ashe	243	" But it cuts both ways . You get neither the good of your good nor the bad of your bad . "
124273	124279	124281	124281	Kitty	243	" I have no good , "
124285	124295	124297	124297	Ashe	243	" What 's the matter with you , miladi ? "
124305	124333	124297	124297	Ashe	243	" You growl over my remarks as though you were your own small dog with a bone . Come here and let me tell you the news . "
124556	124578	124538	124538	herself	243	" You 're awfully good to me , William . But , you know -- you do n't tell me secrets ! "
124579	124587	124538	124538	herself	243	" What do you mean , darling ? "
124588	124608	124538	124538	herself	243	" You do n't tell me the real secrets -- what Lord Palmerston used to tell to Lady Palmerston ! "

124635	124664	124538	124538	herself	243	" One hears -- and one guesses -- from the letters that have been published . Oh , I understand quite well ! You ca n't trust me ! "
124676	124680	124682	124682	Kitty	243	" Of course , "
124688	124718	124682	124682	Kitty	243	" I know it 's my own fault , because you used to tell me much more . I suppose it was the way I behaved to Lord Parham ? "
124745	124749	124751	124751	Ashe	243	" Look here ! "
124759	124780	124751	124751	Ashe	243	" I shall _ really _ give up talking politics to you if it only reminds you of disagreeable things . "
124786	124799	124736	124736	she	243	" Is Lord Parham behaving well to you -- now -- William ? "
124874	124884	124885	124885	he	3881	" He is not the most agreeable of customers , "
124890	124902	124885	124885	he	3881	" But I shall get through . Pegging away does it . "
124903	124914	124916	124916	Kitty	243	" And then to see how our papers flatter him ! "
124918	124942	124916	124916	Kitty	243	" How little people know , who think they know ! It would be amusing to show the world the real Lord Parham . "
124967	124985	124943	124943	She	243	" What we have to do , my dear Kitty , is simply to hold our tongues . "
124993	125001	124986	124986	Kitty	243	" That man never hears the truth ! "
125026	125049	125055	125055	his	3881	" That 's not the purpose for which Prime Ministers exist . Anyway , _ we _ ca n't tell it him . "
125134	125144	125146	125146	Ashe	243	" One of the most treacherous things ever done ! "
125150	125179	125146	125146	Ashe	243	" Fair fight , if you like ! But if that kind of thing were to spread , I for one should throw up politics to - morrow . "
125180	125192	125194	125194	Kitty	243	" Every one said it did a vast deal of good , "
125196	125252	125146	125146	Ashe	243	" A precious sort of good ! Yes -- I believe Parham in particular profited by it -- more shame to him ! If anybody ever tried to help me in that sort of way -- anybody , that is , for whom I felt the smallest responsibility -- I know what I should do . "
125253	125256	125257	125257	Kitty	243	" What ? "
125271	125294	125295	125295	He	3881	" Send in my resignation by the next post -- and damn the fellow that did it ! Look here , Kitty ! "
125313	125329	125295	125295	He	3881	" Do n't you ever try that kind of thing -- there 's a darling . "
125330	125336	125337	125337	She	243	" Would you damn me ? "
125358	125368	125369	125369	he	3881	" Blow out my own brains , more like , "
125379	125437	125375	125375	he	3881	" What on earth have we got into this beastly conversation for ? Let 's get out of it . The Parhams are there -- male and female -- aren't they?--and we 've got to put up with them . Well , I 'm going to the Piazza . Any commissions ? Oh , by - the - way"--he
125445	125467	125494	125494	he	3881	hands--"mother says Polly Lyster will probably be here before we go -- she seems to be touring around with her father . "
125468	125472	125474	125474	Kitty	243	" Charming prospect ! "

Shocking bad form I call it . If the Turks catch him , they 'll string him up . And quite right , too . What 's he got to do with other people 's quarrels ? "

And as for the ' atrocities , ' they make them up in London . Oh , of course , what Cliffe wants is notoriety -- we all know that . Well , I 'm going out to see if I can find another English paper .

134762	134807	134747	134747	Kitty	243	" She looks much older . And she 's not enjoying her life a bit . That 's my fault . I spoiled all her chances with Geoffrey -- and she knows it . She _ hates _ me . Quite right , too . "

134828	134852	134820	134821	Sir Richard	377	" Oh no , I did n't go . But Mary , of course , thought she must go . Somebody invited her . "

134923	134948	134882	134882	Kitty	243	" Wonderful!--and on the water , too . I saw two or three people I knew -- just caught their faces for a second . "
134949	134953	134955	134955	Kitty	243	" Did you ? "
134965	135048	134955	134955	Kitty	243	" Did she see Geoffrey?--and does she mean me to understand that she did ? How she detests me ! If she did see him , of course she supposes that I know all about it , and that he 's here for me . Why do n't I ask her , straight out , whether she saw him , and make her understand that I do n't care twopence?--that she 's welcome to him -- as far as I 'm concerned ? "
135082	135103	135071	135071	her	243	" Yes , yes , she saw him . Perhaps she 'll tell William -- or write home to mother ? "
135196	135211	135174	135174	Ashe	243	" Why , Polly!--and Cousin Richard ! I wondered where you had hidden yourselves . "
135465	135478	135455	135455	herself	243	" I used to amuse William just as well -- last year ! "

135582	135593	135574	135574	Ashe	243	" I always told you she was an excellent gossip . "
135632	135678	135618	135619	Sir Richard	377	" She looks like an actress!--and as to her conversation , she began by telling me outrageous stories and ended by not having a word to say about anything . The bad blood of the Bristols , it seems to me , without their brains . "
135679	135704	135618	135619	Sir Richard	377	" Oh no , papa ! Kitty is very clever . You have n't heard her recite . She was tired to - night . "
135705	135719	135721	135723	the old man	1012	" Well , I do n't want to flatter you , my dear ! "
135727	135756	135721	135723	the old man	1012	" but I thought it was pathetic -- the way in which Ashe enjoyed your conversation . It showed he did n't get much of it at home . "

137410	137421	137422	137422	he	522	" Well!--I saw Lady Kitty in the Piazza this afternoon , "
137440	137459	137433	137434	Donna Laura	521	" Very thin and fragile ! But , by Jove ! how these English beauties hold their own . "
137460	137467	137469	137469	Madame	227	" Irish , if you please , "
137565	137592	137539	137539	she	227	" Why , the silly child has everything she wants ! William is devoted to her -- and it ca n't be long before he succeeds . "
137593	137602	137604	137604	Harman	242	" No need to go trifling with poets , "
137608	137625	137604	137604	Harman	242	" By - the - way , do you know that Geoffrey Cliffe is in Venice ? "
137632	137648	137626	137627	Madame d'Estrées	227	" Est - il possible ? Oh ! but Kitty has forgotten all about him . "
137649	137653	137655	137655	Harman	242	" Of course , "
137657	137669	137655	137655	Harman	242	" I am told he has been seen with the Ricci . "
137688	137692	137693	137693	she	227	" I believe , "
137698	137707	137693	137693	she	227	" that woman may come here this afternoon . "
137708	137716	137717	137717	Harman	242	" Is she a friend of yours ? "
137724	137731	137733	137734	Madame d'Estrées	690	" I knew her in Paris , "
137740	137780	137733	137734	Madame d'Estrées	690	" when she was a student at the Conservatoire . She and I had some common acquaintance . And now -- frankly , I dare n't offend her . She has the most appalling temper!--and she sticks at nothing . "
138259	138263	138274	138274	she	227	" Auld Licht , "
138485	138487	138482	138482	she	227	" chérie "

138645	138652	138653	138653	she	243	" I 'll come another time ! "
138666	138671	138673	138674	Madame d'Estrées	690	" Oh , Kitty ! "
138768	138776	138781	138781	himself	242	" Ah - ha , my lady ! "
138783	138805	138781	138781	himself	242	" Are you , perhaps , interested in the Ricci ? Is it possible even that you have seen her before ? "
138933	138943	138945	138945	Madame	227	" Is n't she lovely , my little Kitty ! "
138970	139025	138945	138945	Madame	227	" I may say it , though I am her mother . And my son - in - law , too . Have you seen him ? Such a handsome fellow!--and _ such _ a dear!--so kind to me . They _ say _ , you know , that he will be Prime Minister . "
139612	139618	139620	139621	Lord Magellan	546	" Thank you very much , "
139670	139682	139683	139683	she	243	" Do you remember that you promised to see me home ? "
139690	139698	139683	139683	she	243	" Do n't if it bores you ! "
139713	139725	139727	139728	the Ricci	4454	" Chère madame , will you present me to your daughter ? "
139750	139756	139736	139736	Madame	227	" Kitty , Mademoiselle Ricci . "
139775	139785	139762	139762	Madame	227	" Please , dear Kitty . I 'll explain . "
139807	139815	139817	139818	the actress	4404	" Ah ! comme elle est charmante ! "
139830	139862	139817	139818	the actress	4404	" Miladi , il faut absolument que nous nous connaissions . Je connais votre chère mère depuis si longtemps ! À Paris , l'hiver passé c'était une amitié des plus tendres ! "
139884	139887	139889	139889	Kitty	243	" Oui ? "
139893	139901	139889	139889	Kitty	243	" Je n'en avais jamais entendu parler . "
139911	139919	139920	139920	she	243	" She has some hold on maman , "
139928	139939	139920	139920	she	243	" She knows of something shady that maman has done . "
139969	139978	139963	139963	she	243	" You 'd like to see the Palazzo ? "
140122	140139	140141	140141	Kitty	243	" Do n't , please , let that woman take you anywhere -- to see anything ! "
140166	140174	140162	140163	Lord Magellan	546	" What 's the matter with her ? "
140175	140180	140182	140182	Kitty	243	" Oh , nothing ! "
140186	140218	140182	140182	Kitty	243	" except that she 's wicked -- and common -- and a snake -- and your mother would have a fit if she knew you had anything to do with her . "
140227	140234	140235	140235	he	4467	" Thank you , Lady Kitty , "
140240	140247	140235	140235	he	4467	" I 'll take your advice . "
140248	140261	140263	140263	Kitty	243	" Oh , I say , what a nice boy you are ! "
140295	140331	140288	140288	she	243	" Maman , of course , knows nothing about her . That was just bluff what she said . But Donna Laura ought n't to ask such people . There -- that 's the way . "
140395	140401	140403	140404	Lord Magellan	546	" What a marvellous place ! "
140731	140737	140739	140740	Lord Magellan	546	" How it dwarfs us ! "
140747	140761	140762	140762	He	546	" One feels the merest pygmy ! From the age of decadence indeed ! "
140773	140786	140762	140762	He	546	" Good Heavens!--if this was their decay , what was their bloom ? "
140787	140801	140803	140803	Kitty	243	" Yes -- it 's big -- and jolly . I like it , "
140812	140821	140822	140822	she	243	" This is your way out . Federigo ! "
140849	140854	140855	140861	The old man , bent and feeble	4496	" Commanda , eccellenza ! "
140943	140953	140955	140955	Kitty	243	" Will you show this signor the way out ? "
140962	140969	140955	140955	Kitty	243	" Are you soon shutting up ? "
142331	142439	142326	142327	Geoffrey Cliffe	252	" How do you do , Lady Kitty ? Do not , I beg of you , let me disturb you . I had half an hour to spare , and I gave the old man down - stairs a franc or two , that he might let me wander over this magnificent old place by myself for a bit . I have always had a fancy for deserted houses . You , I gather , have it , too . I will not interfere with you for a moment . Before I go , however , let me return what I believe to be your property . "
142468	142472	142458	142458	She	4570	" Thank you . "
142532	142548	142527	142527	he	252	" This is not the first time we have met in Venice , Lady Kitty . "
142592	142646	142586	142586	he	252	" You see , perhaps , that I have not grown younger . You are quite right . I have left my youth -- what remained of it -- among those splendid fellows whom the Turks have been harrying and torturing . Well!--they were worth it . I would give it them again . "
142694	142808	142673	142673	Cliffe	252	" I spent last winter , as perhaps you know , with the Bosnian insurgents in the mountains . It was a tough business -- hardships I should never have had the pluck to face if I had known what was before me . Then , in July , I got fever . I had to come away , to find a doctor , and I was a long time at Cattaro pulling round . And , meanwhile , the Turks -- God blast them!--have been at their fiends ' work . Half my particular friends , with whom I spent the winter , have been hacked to pieces since I left them . "
142936	142942	142943	142943	She	4574	" Are you going back ? "
142962	143033	142943	142943	She	4574	" Of course ! I am only kicking my heels here till I can collect the money and stores -- ay , and the _ men_--I want . I give my orders in London , and I must be here to see to the transshipment of stores and the embarkation of my small force ! Not meant for the newspapers , you see , Lady Kitty -- these little details ! "
143069	143076	143078	143078	Kitty	243	" I heard you were wounded , "
143082	143110	143151	143151	his	4575	" So I was -- badly . We were defending a _ polje_--one of their high mountain valleys , against a Beg and his troops . My left arm"--he
143121	143134	143151	143151	his	4575	held--"was nearly cut to pieces . However , it is practically well . "
143167	143185	143155	143155	He	4575	" Do n't , however , let me delay you , Lady Kitty -- by my chatter . "
143236	143245	143246	143246	she	243	" Have you another volume on the way ? "
143254	143260	143246	143246	she	243	" I read your last . "
143275	143285	143270	143270	He	4575	" Did you ? That was waste of time . "
143286	143296	143270	143270	He	4575	" I think you intended I should read it . "
143300	143323	143324	143324	He	4575	" Lady Kitty , those things are very far away . I ca n't defend myself -- for they seem wiped out . "
143353	143359	143350	143350	Kitty	243	" You overstate the difference ! "
143360	143373	143428	143428	His	4575	" Between the past and the present ? What does that mean ? "
143385	143394	143374	143374	She	243	" Do you often go to San Lazzaro ? "
143398	143427	143395	143395	He	4575	" I had a suspicion that the vision at the window -- though it was there only an instant -- was you ! So you saw Mademoiselle Ricci ? "
143454	143474	143428	143428	His	4575	" I find her kind , Lady Kitty . She listens to me -- I get sympathy from her . "
143475	143481	143482	143482	Her	243	" And you want sympathy ? "
143487	143512	143482	143482	Her	243	" As a hungry man wants food --as an artist wants beauty . But I know where I shall _ not _ get it . "
143513	143520	143522	143522	Kitty	243	" That is always a gain ! "
143530	143543	143522	143522	Kitty	243	" Mr. Cliffe , pray let me bid you good - bye . "
143551	143553	143544	143544	He	4575	" Lady Kitty!"--his
143562	143598	143544	143544	He	4575	face--"I ca n't restrain myself . Your look -- your expression -- go to my heart . Laugh at me if you like . It 's true . What have you been doing with yourself ? "
143623	143647	143619	143619	She	243	" Mr. Cliffe , you must know that any sympathy from you to me -- is an insult ! Kindly let me pass . "
143655	143670	143648	143648	He	4575	" Insult is a hard word , Lady Kitty . I regret that poem . "
143685	143696	143698	143698	his	4575	" I wrote it -- almost in delirium . Ah , well"--he
143700	143728	143729	143729	His	4575	impatiently--"if you do n't believe me , let it be . I am not the man I was . The perspective of things is altered for me . "
143733	143802	143729	143729	His	4575	" Women and children in their blood -- heroic trust -- and brute hate -- the stars for candles -- the high peaks for friends -- those things have come between me and the past . But you are right ; we had better not talk any more . I hear old Federigo coming up the stairs . Good - night , Lady Kitty -- good - night ! "
143865	143870	143871	143871	He	4575	" I think not . "
143878	143887	143871	143871	He	4575	" Here is Federigo . Good - night . "
143974	143977	143978	143978	Ashe	243	" William ! "
144058	144123	144051	144051	She	243	" William , William ! I did n't mean any harm ! I did n't ! Oh , I have been so miserable ! I tried to stop it -- I did all I could . I have hardly slept at all -- since we talked -- you remember ? Oh , William , look at me ! Do n't be angry with me ! "
144128	144154	144124	144124	Ashe	219	" I have asked Blanche to pack for me to - night , Kitty . I go home by the early train to - morrow . "
144155	144158	144051	144051	She	243	" Home ! "
144171	144186	144051	144051	She	243	" You 'll buy it all up ? You 'll stop it , William ? "
144192	144198	144199	144199	he	219	" I am going home , "
144206	144218	144199	144199	he	219	" to place my resignation in the hands of Lord Parham . "
144258	144269	144270	144270	she	243	" Of course you did n't mean that , William ? "
144279	144308	144276	144276	Ashe	243	" I should not have said it unless I had meant every word of it . It is , of course , the only thing to be done . "
144315	144334	144309	144309	Kitty	243	" But you _ ca n't _ mean that -- that you 'll resign because of that book ? "
144351	144358	144335	144335	She	243	" That would be too foolish ! "
144400	144403	144404	144404	She	243	" William ! "
144416	144429	144404	144404	She	243	" I wrote that book because I thought it would help you . "
144437	144447	144430	144430	His	219	" Yes , Kitty , I believe you did . "
144463	144505	144454	144454	His	219	" Many people have done such things . I know they have . Why -- why , it was only meant -- as a skit -- to make people laugh ! There 's _ no _ harm in it , William . "
144580	144594	144624	144624	Her	243	" When did you have the first idea of this book , Kitty ? "
144595	144601	144602	144602	she	243	" About a year ago , "
144610	144617	144602	144602	she	243	" In October ? At Haggart ? "
144800	144816	144782	144782	He	219	" I wish I knew what could have been your possible object in writing it ? "
144834	144948	144830	144830	her	243	" You know I told you -- when we had that talk in London -- that I wanted to write . I thought it would be good for me -- would take my thoughts off -- well , what had happened . And I began to write this -- and it amused me to find I could do it -- and I suppose I got carried away . I loved describing you , and glorifying you -- and I loved making caricatures of Lady Parham -- and all the people I hated . I used to work at it whenever you were away -- or I was dull and there was nothing to do .
144949	144957	144959	144959	Ashe	243	" Did it never occur to you , "
144963	144985	144959	144959	Ashe	243	" that it might get you -- get us both -- into trouble , and that you ought to tell me ? "
144989	144992	144993	144993	she	4596	" No ! "
144999	145037	144993	144993	she	4596	" I never did mean to tell you , while I was writing it . You know I do n't tell lies , William ! The real fact is , I was afraid you 'd stop it . "
145038	145042	145043	145043	He	4597	" Good God ! "
145069	145071	144993	144993	she	4596	" But then"--she
145072	145106	144993	144993	she	4596	resumed--"I thought you 'd soon get over it , and that it was funny -- and everybody would laugh -- and you 'd laugh -- and there would be an end of it . "
145114	145137	145107	145107	He	4597	" Frankly , Kitty -- I do n't understand what you can be made of ! You imagined that that sketch of Lord Parham"--he
145141	145372	144993	144993	she	4596	page--"a sketch written by _ my wife _ , describing my official chief -- when he was my guest -- under my own roof -- with all sorts of details of the most intimate and offensive kind -- mocking his speech -- his manners -- his little personal ways -- charging him with being the corrupt tool of Lady Parham , disloyal to his colleagues , a man not to be trusted -- and justifying all this by a sort of evidence that you could only have got as my wife and Lord Parham 's hostess -- you actually supposed that you could write and publish _ that!_--without in the first place its being plain to every Tom , Dick , and Harry that you had written it -- and in the next , without making it impossible for your husband to remain a colleague of the man you had treated in such a way ? Kitty!--you are not a stupid woman ! Do you really mean to say that you could write and publish this book without _ knowing _ that you were doing a wrong action -- which , so far from serving me , could only damage my career irreparably ? Did nothing -- did no one warn you -- if you were determined to keep such a secret from your husband , whom it most concerned ? "
145412	145418	145420	145420	Kitty	243	" Mr. Darrell warned me , "
145436	145445	145420	145420	Kitty	243	her--"but of course I did n't believe him . "
145446	145449	145451	145451	Ashe	243	" Darrell ! "
145454	145461	145451	145451	Ashe	243	amazement--"Darrell ! You confided in him ? "
145462	145480	145489	145489	his	4598	" I told him all about it . It was he who took it to a publisher . "
145481	145484	145486	145486	Ashe	243	" Hound ! "
145492	145499	145486	145486	Ashe	243	" So that was his revenge . "
145500	145511	145513	145513	Kitty	243	" Oh , you need n't blame him too much , "
145522	145546	145513	145513	Kitty	243	" He wrote to me not long ago to say it was horribly unwise -- and that he washed his hands of it . "
145547	145564	145566	145566	Ashe	243	" Ay -- when he 'd done the deed ! When did you show it him ? "
145570	145577	145513	145513	Kitty	243	" At Haggart -- in August . "
145578	145586	145588	145588	Ashe	243	" _ Et tu , Brute ! _ "
145593	145641	145513	145513	Kitty	243	" Well , that 's done with . Now the only thing to do is to face the music . I go home . Whatever can be done to withdraw the book from circulation I shall , of course , do ; but I gather from this precious letter"--he
145652	145677	145513	145513	Kitty	243	parcel--"that some thousands of copies have already been ordered by the booksellers , and a few distributed to ' persons in high places . ' "
145678	145681	145682	145682	she	243	" William , "
145691	145706	145682	145682	she	243	again--"listen ! I offered the man two hundred pounds only yesterday to stop it . "
145710	145716	145707	145707	Ashe	243	" What did he reply ? "
145717	145731	145783	145783	he	4600	" He said it was impossible . Fifty copies had been already issued . "
145732	145778	145783	145783	he	4600	" The review copies , no doubt . By next week there will be , I should say , five thousand in the shops . Your man understands his business , Kitty . This is the kind of puff preliminary he has been scattering about . "
145831	146021	145783	145783	he	4600	" People of the highest social and political importance will be recognized at once ; the writer handles cabinet ministers and their wives with equal freedom , and with a touch betraying the closest and most intimate knowledge . Details hitherto quite unknown to the public of ministerial combinations and intrigues -- especially of the feminine influences involved -- will be found here in their lightest and most amusing form . A certain famous fancy ball will be identified without difficulty . Scathing as some of the portraits are , the writer is by no means merely cynical . The central figure of the book is a young and rising statesman , whose aim and hopes are touched with a loving hand -- the charm of the portrait being only equalled by the venom with which the writer assails those who have thwarted or injured his hero . But our advice is simply--'Buy and Read ! ' Conjecture will run wild about the writer . All we can say is that the most romantic or interesting surmise that can possibly be formed will fall far short of the reality . "
146022	146030	146032	146032	Ashe	243	" The beast is a shrewd beast ! "
146055	146077	146035	146035	he	4603	" He knows that the public will rush for his wares ! How much money did he offer you , Kitty ? "
146090	146095	146097	146097	Kitty	243	" A hundred pounds , "
146100	146109	146097	146097	Kitty	243	inaudibly--"and a hundred more if five thousand sold . "
146122	146127	146129	146129	Ashe	243	" Generous!--upon my word ! "
146145	146172	146129	146129	Ashe	243	" A guinea to the public , I suppose -- fifteen shillings to the trade . Darrell did n't exactly advise you to advantage , Kitty . "
146224	146236	146209	146209	she	243	" What do you mean to do -- exactly -- William ? "
146237	146306	146209	146209	she	243	" I shall , of course , buy up all I can ; I shall employ some lawyer fellow , and appeal to the good feelings of the newspapers . There will be no trouble with the respectable ones . But some copies will get out , and some of the Opposition newspapers will make capital out of them . Naturally!--they'd be precious fools if they did n't . "
146315	146331	146332	146332	she	243	" But if you buy it up -- and stop all the papers that matter , "
146333	146350	146209	146209	she	243	faltered--"why should you resign , William ? There wo n't be -- such great harm done . "
146416	146431	146453	146453	she	1801	" Do you remember the night when I told you those things , Kitty ? "
146502	146559	146486	146486	he	4603	" You wrote that -- when he was under our roof -- there by our pressing invitation ! You could n't have written it -- unless he had so put himself in your power . A wandering Arab , Kitty , will do no harm to the man who has eaten and drunk in his tent ! "
146599	146603	146598	146601	The " great gentleman	6961	" great gentleman , "
146641	146657	146632	146632	She	243	" William , you ca n't give up politics ! It would make you miserable . "
146658	146694	146695	146695	They	4612	" That ca n't be helped . And I could n't go on like this , Kitty -- even if this affair of the book could be patched up . The strain 's too great . "
146715	146725	146704	146704	she	243	" You have been so happy in your work ! "
146733	146744	146745	146745	he	4603	" Oh , do n't let 's talk about that , "
146755	146791	146745	146745	he	4603	" There 'll be a certain relief in giving up the impossible . I 'll go back to my books . We can travel , I suppose , and put politics out of our heads . "

148121	148337	148363	148363	he	4639	" A string of extracts from a forthcoming book , accompanied by a somewhat startling publisher 's statement , has lately been sent round to the press . We are asked not to print them before the day of publication , but they have already roused much attention , if not excitement . They certainly contain a very gross attack on the Prime Minister , based apparently on first - hand information , and involving indiscretions personal and political of an unusually serious character . The wife of a cabinet minister is freely named as the writer , and even if no violation of cabinet secrecy is concerned , it is clear that the book outrages the confidential relations which ought to subsist between a Premier and his colleagues , if government on our English system is to be satisfactorily carried on . The statements it makes with every appearance of authority both as to the relations between Lord Parham and some of the most important members of his cabinet , and as to the Premier 's intentions with regard to one or two of the most vital questions now before the country , are calculated seriously to embarrass the government . We fear the book will have a veritable _ succès de scandale _ . "

152957	153157	153168	153168	he	4767	" I believe -- yes , by God , I believe!--that I am a better man than I was before I started on this adventure . It 's been like drinking at last at the very source of life -- living , not talking about it . One bitter night last February , for instance , I helped a man -- one of the insurgents -- who had taken to the mountains with his wife and children -- to carry his wife , a dying woman , over a mountain - pass to the only place where she could possibly get help and shelter . We carried her on a litter , six men taking turns . The cold and the fatigue were such that I shudder now when I think of it . Yet at the end I seemed to myself a man reborn . I was happier than I had ever been in my life . Some mystic virtue had flowed into me . Among those men and women , instead of being the selfish beast I 've been all these years , I can forget myself . Death seems nothing -- brotherhood -- liberty!--everything ! And yet-- "

He blames you -- you blame yourself . What _ reality _ has all that ? It makes you miserable -- it wastes life . _ I _ accept your nature -- I do n't ask you to be anything else than yourself -- your wild , vain , adorable self ! Ashe asks you to put restraint on yourself -- to make painful efforts -- to be good for his sake -- the sake of something outside . _ I _ say -- come and look at the elemental things -- death and battle -- hatred , solitude , love . _ They 'll _ sweep us out of ourselves!--no need to strive and cry for it -- into the great current of the world 's being -- bring us close to the forces at the root of things -- the forces which create -- and destroy . Dip your heart in that stream , Kitty , and feel it grow in your breast . Take a nurse 's dress -- put your hand in mine -- and come ! I ca n't promise you luxuries or ease . You 've had enough of those . Come and open another door in the House of Life ! Take starving women and hunted children into your arms--- feel with them -- weep with them -- look with them into the face of death ! Make friends with nature -- with rocks , forests , torrents -- with night and dawn , which you 've never seen , Kitty ! They 'll love you -- they'll support you -- the rough people -- and the dark forests . They 'll draw nature 's glamour round you -- they'll pour her balm into your soul . And I shall be with you -- beside you!--your guardian -- your lover -- your _ lover _ , Kitty -- till death do us part . "

153652	153683	153710	153710	he	4769	" Of course , that 's all nonsense -- romantic nonsense . You 've perhaps forgotten that I am one of the women who do n't stir without their maid . "

153715	153743	153780	153780	she	4773	" that settles it . A maid would be the deuce . And yet -- I think I could find you a Bosnian girl -- strong and faithful-- "

155689	155782	155640	155640	She	243	" I am glad -- oh ! so glad , William -- that you _ have _ withdrawn your resignation -- that people have come forward so splendidly , and _ made _ you withdraw it -- that Lord Parham is behaving decently -- and that you have been able to get hold of all those copies of the book . I always hoped it would not be quite so bad as you thought . But I know you must have gone through an awful time -- and I 'm _ sorry _ .
155783	155908	155679	155679	she	243	" William , I want to tell you something -- for I ca n't go on lying to you -- or even just hiding the truth . I met Geoffrey Cliffe here -- before you left -- and I never told you . I saw him first in a gondola the night of the serenata -- and then at the Armenian convent . Do you remember my hurrying you and Margaret into the garden ? That was to escape meeting him . And that same afternoon when I was in the unused rooms of the Palazzo Vercelli -- the rooms they show to tourists -- he suddenly appeared -- and somehow I spoke to him , though I had never meant to do so again .
155909	155975	155640	155640	She	243	" Then when you left me I met him again -- that afternoon -- and he found out I was very miserable and made me tell him everything . I know I had no right to do so -- they were your secrets as well as mine . But you know how little I can control myself -- it 's wretched , but it 's true .
155976	156166	155679	155679	she	243	" William , I do n't know what will happen . I ca n't make out from Margaret whether she has written to you or not -- she wo n't tell me . If she has , this letter will not be much news to you . But , mind , I write it of my own free will , and not because Margaret may have forced my hand . I should have written it anyway . Poor old darling!--she thinks me mad and bad , and to - night she tells me she ca n't take the responsibility of looking after me any longer . Women like her can never understand creatures like me -- and I do n't want her to . She 's a dear saint , and as true as steel -- not like your Mary Lysters ! I could go on my knees to her . But she ca n't control or save me . Not even you could , William . You 've tried your best , and in spite of you I 'm going to perdition , and I ca n't stop myself .
156167	156320	155640	155640	She	243	" For , William , there 's something broken forever between you and me . I know it was I who did the wrong , and that you had no choice but to leave me when you did . But yet you _ did _ leave me , though I implored you not . And I know very well that you do n't love me as you used to -- why should you?--and that you never can love me in the same way again . Every letter you write tells me that . And though I have deserved it all , I ca n't bear it . When I think of coming home to England , and how you would try to be nice to me -- how good and dear and magnanimous you would be , and what a beast I should feel -- I want to drown myself and have done .
156321	156595	155679	155679	she	243	" It all seems to me so hopeless . It is my own nature--- the stuff out of which I am cut -- that 's all wrong . I may promise my breath away that I will be discreet and gentle and well behaved , that I 'll behave properly to people like Lady Parham , that I 'll keep secrets , and not make absurd friendships with absurd people , that I 'll try and keep out of debt , and so on . But what 's the use ? It 's the _ will _ in me -- the something that drives , or ought to drive -- that wo n't work . And nobody ever taught me or showed me , that I can remember , till I met you . In Paris at the Place Vendôme , half the time I used to live with maman and papa , be hideously spoiled , dressed absurdly , eat off silver plate , and make myself sick with rich things -- and then for days together maman would go out or away , forget all about me , and I used to storm the kitchen for food . She either neglected me or made a show of me ; she was my worst enemy , and I hated and fought her -- till I went to the convent at ten . When I was fourteen maman asked a doctor about me . He said I should probably go mad -- and at the convent they thought the same . Maman used to throw this at me when she was cross with me .
156596	156790	155640	155640	She	243	" Well , I do n't repeat this to make you excuse me and think better of me--- it 's all too late for that -- but because I am such a puzzle to myself , and I try to explain things . I _ did _ love you , William -- I believe I do still -- but when I think of our living together again , my arms drop by my side and I feel like a dead creature . Your life is too great a thing for me . Why should I spoil or hamper it ? If you loved me , as you did once -- if you still thought _ everything _ worth while , then , if I had a spark of decency left , I might kill myself to free you , but I should never do -- what I may do now . But , William , you 'll forget me soon . You 'll pass great laws , and make great speeches , and the years when I tormented you -- and all my wretched ways -- will seem such a small , small thing .
156791	157049	155679	155679	she	243	" Geoffrey says he loves me . And I think he does , though how long it will last , or may be worth , no one can tell . As for me , I do n't know whether I love him . I have no illusion about him . But there are moments when he absolutely holds me -- when my will is like wax in his hands . It is because , I think , of a certain grandness--_grandeur _ seems too strong -- in his character . It was always there ; because no one could write such poems as his without it . But now it 's more marked , though I do n't know that it makes him a better man . He thinks it does ; but we all deceive ourselves . At any rate , he is often superb , and I feel that I could die , if not for him , at least with him . And he is not unlikely to die in some heroic way . He went out as you know simply as correspondent and to distribute relief , but lately he has been fighting for these people -- of course he has!--and when he goes back he is to be one of their regular leaders . When he talks of it he is noble , transformed . It reminds me of Byron -- his wicked life here -- and then his death at Missolonghi . Geoffrey can do such base , cruel things -- and yet--
157050	157190	155640	155640	She	243	" But I have n't yet told you . He asks me to go with him , back to the fighting - lines in upper Bosnia . There seems to be a great deal that women can do . I shall wear a nurse 's uniform , and probably nurse at a little hospital he founded -- high up in one of the mountain valleys . I know this will almost make you laugh . You will think of me , not knowing how to put on a button without Blanche -- and wanting to be waited on every moment . But you 'll see ; there 'll be nothing of that sort . I wonder whether it 's hardship I 've been thirsting for all my life -- even when I seemed such a selfish , luxurious little ape ?
157191	157232	155679	155679	she	243	" At the same time , I think it will kill me -- and that would be the best end of all . To have some great , heroic experience , and then--'cease upon the midnight with no pain ! ... '
157233	157293	155640	155640	She	243	" Oh , if I thought you 'd care very , _ very _ much , I should have pain -- horrible pain . But I know you wo n't . Politics have taken my place . Think of me sometimes , as I was when we were first married -- and of Harry -- my little , little fellow !
157294	157440	155679	155679	she	243	" --Maman and I have had a ghastly scene . She came to scold me for my behavior -- to say I was the talk of Venice . _ She ! _ Of course I know what she means . She thinks if I am divorced she will lose her allowance -- and she ca n't bear the thought of that , though Markham Warington is quite rich . My heart just _ boiled _ within me . I told her it is the poison of her life that works in me , and that whatever I do , _ she _ has no right to reproach me . Then she cried -- and I was like ice -- and at last she went . Warington , good fellow , has written to me , and asked to see me . But what is the use ?
157441	157536	155640	155640	She	243	" I know you 'll leave me the £ 500 a year that was settled on me . It 'll be so good for me to be poor -- and dressed in serge -- and trying to do something else with these useless hands than writing books that break your heart . I am giving away all my smart clothes . Blanche is going home . Oh , William , William ! I 'm going to shut this , and it 's like the good - bye of death -- a mean and ugly--_death _ .
157537	157598	155640	155640	She	243	" ... Later . They have just brought me a note from Danieli 's . So Margaret did write to you , and your mother has come . Why did you send her , William ? She does n't love me -- and I shall only stab and hurt her . Though I 'll try not -- for your sake . "
157627	157652	155679	155679	she	243	" My DEAREST WILLIAM,--I have seen Kitty . With some difficulty she consented to let me go and see her yesterday evening about nine o'clock .
157653	157815	155640	155640	She	243	" I arrived between six and seven , having travelled straight through without a break , except for an hour or two at Milan , and immediately on arriving I sent a note to Margaret French . She came in great distress , having just had a fresh scene with Kitty . Oh , my dear William , her report could not well be worse . Since she wrote to us Kitty seems to have thrown over all precautions . They used to meet in churches or galleries , and go out for long days in the gondola or a fishing - boat together , and Kitty would come home alone and lie on the sofa through the evening , almost without speaking or moving . But lately he comes in with her , and stays hours , reading to her , or holding her hand , or talking to her in a low voice , and Margaret can not stop it .
157816	157992	155679	155679	she	243	" Yet she has done her best , poor girl ! Knowing what we all knew last year , it filled her with terror when she first discovered that he was in Venice and that they had met . But it was not till it had gone on about a week , with the strangest results on Kitty 's spirits and nerves , that she felt she must interfere . She not only spoke to Kitty , but she spoke and wrote to him in a very firm , dignified way . Kitty took no notice -- only became very silent and secretive . And he treated poor Margaret with a kind of courteous irony which made her blood boil , and against which she could do nothing . She says that Kitty seems to her sometimes like a person moving in sleep -- only half conscious of what she is doing ; and at others she is wildly excitable , irritable with everybody , and only calming down and becoming reasonable when this man appears .
157993	158097	155640	155640	She	243	" There is much talk in Venice . They seem to have been seen together by various London friends who knew -- about the difficulties last year . And then , of course , everybody is aware that you are not here -- and the whole story of the book goes from mouth to mouth -- and people say that a separation has been arranged -- and so on . These are the kind of rumors that Margaret hears , especially from Mary Lyster , who is staying in this hotel with her father , and seems to have a good many friends here .
158098	158189	155679	155679	she	243	" Dearest William -- I have been lingering on these things because it is so hard to have to tell you what passed between me and Kitty . Oh ! my dear , dear son , take courage . Even now everything is not lost . Her conscience may awaken at the last moment ; this bad man may abandon his pursuit of her ; I may still succeed in bringing her back to you . But I am in terrible fear -- and I must tell you the whole truth .
158190	158364	155640	155640	She	243	" Kitty received me alone . The room was very dark -- only one lamp that gave a bad light -- so that I saw her very indistinctly . She was in black , and , as far as I could see , extremely pale and weary . And what struck me painfully was her haggard , careless look . All the little details of her dress and hair seemed so neglected . Blanche says she is far too irritable and impatient in the mornings to let her hair be done as usual . She just rolls it into one big knot herself and puts a comb in it . She wears the simplest clothes , and changes as little as possible . She says she is soon going to have done with all that kind of thing , and she must get used to it . My own impression is that she is going through great agony of mind -- above all , that she is ill -- ill in body and soul .
158365	158625	155679	155679	she	243	" She told me quite calmly , however , that she had made up her mind to leave you ; she said that she had written to you to tell you so . I asked her if it was because she had ceased to love you . After a pause she said ' No . ' Was it because some one else had come between you ? She threw up her head proudly , and said it was best to be quite plain and frank . She had met Geoffrey Cliffe again , and she meant henceforward to share his life . Then she went into the wildest dreams about going back with him to the Balkans , and nursing in a hospital , and dying -- she hopes!--of hard work and privations . And all this in a torrent of words -- and her eyes blazing , with that look in them as though she saw nothing but the scenes of her own imagination . She talked of devotion -- and of forgetting herself in other people . I could only tell her , of course , that all this sounded to me the most grotesque sophistry and perversion . She was forgetting her first duty , breaking her marriage vow , and tearing your life asunder . She shook her head , and said you would soon forget her . ' If he had loved me he would never have left me ! ' she said , again and again , with a passion I shall never forget .
158626	158800	155640	155640	She	243	" Of course that made me very angry , and I described what the situation had been when you reached London -- Lord Parham 's state of mind -- and the consternation caused everywhere by the wretched book . I tried to make her understand what there was at stake -- the hopes of all who follow you in the House and the country -- the great reforms of which you are the life and soul -- your personal and political honor . I impressed on her the endless trouble and correspondence in which you had been involved -- and how meanwhile all your Home Office and cabinet work had to be carried on as usual , till it was decided whether your resignation should be withdrawn or no . She listened with her head on her hands . I think with regard to the book she is most genuinely ashamed and miserable . And yet all the time there is this unreasonable , this monstrous feeling that you should not have left her !
158801	158888	155679	155679	she	243	" As to the scandalous references to private persons , she said that Madeleine Alcot had written to her about the country - house gossip . That wretched being , Mr. Darrell , seems also to have written to her , trying to save himself through her . And the only time I saw her laugh was when she spoke of having had a furious letter from Lady Grosville about the references to Grosville Park . It was like the laugh of a mischievous , unhappy child .
158889	159159	155640	155640	She	243	" Then we came back to the main matter , and I implored her to let me take her home . First I gave her your letter . She read it , flushed up , and threw it away from her . ' He commands me ! ' she said , fiercely . ' But I am no one 's chattel . ' I replied that you had only summoned her back to her duty and her home , and I asked her if she could really mean to repay your unfailing love by bringing anguish and dishonor upon you ? She sat dumb , and her stubbornness moved me so that I fear I lost my self - control and said more , much more -- in denunciation of her conduct -- than I had meant to do . She heard me out , and then she got up and looked at me very bitterly and strangely . I had never loved her , she said , and so I could not judge her . Always from the beginning I had thought her unfit to be your wife , and she had known it , and my dislike of her , especially during the past year , had made her hard and reckless . It had seemed no use trying . I just wanted her dead , that you might marry a wife who would be a help and not a stumbling - block . Well , I should have my wish , for she would soon be as good as dead , both to you and to me .
159160	159223	155679	155679	she	243	" All this hurt me deeply , and I could not restrain myself from crying . I felt so helpless , and so doubtful whether I had not done more harm than good . Then she softened a little , and asked me to let her go to bed -- she would think it all over and write to me in the morning ....
159224	159260	155640	155640	She	243	" So , my dear William , I can only pray and wait . I am afraid there is but little hope , but God is merciful and strong . He may yet save us all .
159261	159369	160406	160406	She	243	" But whatever happens , remember that you have nothing to reproach yourself with -- that you have done all that man could do . I should telegraph to you in the morning to say , ' Come , at all hazards , ' but that I feel sure all will be settled to - morrow one way or the other . Either Kitty will start with me -- or she will go with Geoffrey Cliffe . You could do nothing -- absolutely nothing . God help us ! She seems to have some money , and she told me that she counted on retaining her jointure . "
160424	160710	160716	160716	She	4866	" Kitty -- I bid you come home . I should have started for Venice an hour ago , after reading Miss French 's letter , but that honor and public duty keep me here . But mother is going , and I implore and command you , as your husband , to return with her . Oh , Kitty , have I ever failed you?--have I ever been hard with you?--that you should betray our love like this ? Was I hard when we parted -- a month ago ? If I was , forgive me , I was sore pressed . Come home , you poor child , and you shall hear no reproaches from me . I think I have nearly succeeded in undoing your rash work . But what good will that be to me if you are to use my absence for that purpose to bring us both to ruin ? Kitty , the grass is not yet green on our child 's grave . I was at Haggart last Sunday , and I went over in the dusk to put some flowers upon it . I thought of you without a moment 's bitterness , and prayed for us both , if such as I may pray . Then next morning came Miss French 's letter . Kitty , have you no heart -- and no conscience ? Will you bring disgrace on that little grave ? Will you dig between us the gulf which is irreparable , across which your hand and mine can never touch each other any more ? I can not and I will not believe it . Come back to me -- come back ! "
160738	160740	160883	160884	William Ashe	219	" command "
160887	160900	161693	161694	The speaker	623	" Oh ! my dearest William -- at last a gleam of hope .
160901	161030	160883	160884	William Ashe	219	" No letter this morning . I was in despair . Margaret reported that Kitty refused to see any one -- had locked her door , and was writing . Yet no letter came . I made an attempt to see Geoffrey Cliffe , who is staying at the ' Germania , ' but he refused . He wrote me the most audacious letter to say that an interview could only be very painful , that he and Kitty must decide for themselves , that he was waiting every hour for a final word from Kitty . It rested with her , and with her only . Coercion in these matters was no longer possible , and he did not suppose that either you or I would attempt it .
161031	161087	161693	161694	The speaker	623	" And now comes this blessed note -- a respite at least ! ' _ I am going to Verona to - night with Blanche . Please let no one attempt to follow me . I wish to have two days alone -- absolutely alone . Wait here . I will write . K _ . '
161088	161223	160883	160884	William Ashe	219	" ... Margaret French , too , has just been here . She was almost hysterical with relief and joy -- and you know what a calm , self - controlled person she is . But her dear , round face has grown white , and her eyes behind her spectacles look as though she had not slept for nights . She says that Kitty will not see her . She sent her a note by Blanche to ask her to settle all the accounts , and told her that she should not say good - bye -- it would be too agitating for them both . In two days she should hear . Meanwhile the maid Blanche is certainly going with Kitty ; and the gondola is ordered for the Milan train this evening .
161224	161547	161693	161694	The speaker	623	" Two P.M. There is one thing that troubles me , and I must confess it . I did not see that across Kitty 's letter in the corner was written ' Tell _ nobody _ about this letter . ' And Polly Lyster happened to be with me when it came . She has been _ au courant _ of the whole affair for the last fortnight -- that is , as an on - looker . She and Kitty have only met once or twice since Mary reached Venice ; but in one way or another she has been extraordinarily well informed . And , as I told you , she came to see me directly I arrived and told me all she knew . You know her old friendship for us , William ? She has many weaknesses , and of late I have thought her much changed , grown very hard and bitter . But she is always _ very _ loyal to you and me -- and I could not help betraying my feeling when Kitty 's note reached me . Mary came and put her arms round me , and I said to her , ' Oh , Mary , thank God!--she 's broken with him ! She 's going to Verona to - night on the way home ! ' And she kissed me and seemed so glad . And I was very grateful to her for her sympathy , for I am beginning to feel my age , and this has been rather a strain . But I ought n't to have told her!--or anybody ! I see , of course , what Kitty meant . It is incredible that Mary should breathe a word -- or if she did that it should reach that man . But I have just sent her a note to Danieli 's to warn her in the strongest way .
161548	161621	160883	160884	William Ashe	219	" Beloved son -- if , indeed , we save her -- we will be very good to her , you and I. We will remember her bringing up and her inheritance . I will be more loving -- more like Christ . I hope He will forgive me for my harshness in the past .... My William!--I love you so ! God be merciful to you and to your poor Kitty ! "
161627	161645	160883	160884	William Ashe	219	" Will the signora have her dinner outside or in the _ salle - à - manger ? "
161680	161692	161848	161848	she	2551	" Out here , please -- and for my maid also . "
161817	161820	161848	161848	she	2551	" Blanche ! "
161821	161827	161848	161848	she	2551	" Yes , my lady ? "
161828	161842	161853	161853	Kitty	243	" Bring a chair , Blanchie , and come and sit by me . "
161864	161873	161848	161848	she	2551	" Are you very tired , my lady ? "
161874	161882	161971	161971	Kitty	243	" Yes -- but do n't talk ! "
161962	161969	161971	161971	Kitty	243	" Go , Blanche , go ! "
161975	161982	161996	161997	the girl	739	" go back into the hotel . "
161983	161994	162007	162007	Kitty	243	" Not unless your ladyship wishes me to leave you , "
162001	162006	162116	162116	he	252	" Go at once ! "
162108	162115	162162	162162	He	252	" Kitty!--why did you do this ? "
162184	162292	162298	162298	she	4893	" Cruel -- cruel child , to play with me so ! Did you mean to put me to a last test?--or did your hard little heart misgive you at the last moment ? I cross - examined your landlady -- I bribed the servants -- the gondoliers . Not a word ! They were loyal -- or you had paid them better . I went back to my hotel in black despair . Oh , you artist!--you plotter ! Kitty -- you shall pay me this some day ! And there -- there on my table -- all the time -- lay your little crumpled note ! "
162293	162297	162162	162162	He	252	" What note ? "
162299	162302	162307	162307	he	4894	gasped--"what note ? "
162303	162306	162328	162328	he	4894	" Actress ! "
162363	162375	162328	162328	he	4894	" Too many spectators . Come to Verona to - night . "
162377	162377	162442	162442	Cliffe	252	"
162462	162478	162490	162490	he	987	" Pluck , pluck cypress , O pale maidens , Dusk the hall with yew ! "
162480	162484	162490	162490	he	987	" How strange ! "
162513	162520	162611	162611	she	4903	" He is certainly in town . "
162634	162640	162894	162895	the butler	634	" staying with her ladyship . "
162882	162892	163087	163088	Johnny Russell	589	" Mr. Ashe will be down directly , sir , "
163083	163086	163175	163178	a " new man	7212	portraits--"the Duke , "
163176	163180	163175	163178	a " new man	7212	" new man , "
163188	163501	163562	163562	he	987	" Ashe is magnificent ! At last our side has found its leader . Oh ! Parham will disappear with the next appeal to the country . He is getting too infirm ! Above all , his eyes are nearly gone ; his oculist , I hear , gives him no more than six months ' sight , unless he throws up . Then Ashe will take his proper place , and if he does n't make his mark on English history , I 'm a Dutchman . Oh ! of course that affair last year was an awful business -- the two affairs ! When Parliament opened in February there were some of us who thought that Ashe would never get through the session . A man so changed , so struck down , I have seldom seen . You remember what a handsome boy he was , up to last year even ! Now he 's a middle - aged man . All the same , he held on , and the House gave him that quiet sympathy and support that it can give when it likes a fellow . And gradually you could see the life come back into him -- and the ambition . By George ! he did well in that trade - union business before Easter ; and the bill that 's on now -- it 's masterly , the way in which he 's piloting it through ! The House positively likes to be managed by him ; it 's a sight worthy of our best political traditions . Oh yes , Ashe will go far ; and , thank God , that wretched little woman -- what has become of her , by - the - way?--has neither crushed his energy nor robbed England of his services . But it was touch and go . "
163585	163619	163655	163655	Ashe	247	" Who will lead me into the strong city : who will bring me into Edom ? Oh , be thou our help in trouble : for vain is the help of man . "
163643	163653	163655	163655	Ashe	247	" How do you do , my dear Dean ? "
163668	163697	163665	163665	his	247	" I trust I have not kept you waiting . My mother was with me . Sit there , please ; you will have the light behind you . "
163698	163720	163825	163826	the Dean	987	" Thank you . I prefer standing a little , if you do n't mind -- and I like the fire . "
163817	163823	163825	163826	the Dean	987	" I think you know , "
163832	163841	163860	163860	Ashe	247	" why I asked you to see me ? "
163842	163858	163880	163881	The Dean	277	" You wished , I think , to speak to me -- about my wife , "
163906	163972	163880	163881	The Dean	277	" I heard from her ten days ago -- the most piteous letter . As you know , I had always a great regard for her . The news of last year was a sharp sorrow to me -- as though she had been a daughter . I felt I must see her . So I put myself into the train and went to Venice . "
163982	164005	163880	163881	The Dean	277	" Or , rather , to Treviso , for , as I think you know , she is there with Lady Alice . "
164006	164014	164015	164016	The Dean	277	" Yes , that I had heard . "
164033	164056	164063	164063	Ashe	247	" May I ask -- stop me if I seem impertinent -- how much you know of the history of the winter ? "
164057	164061	164063	164063	Ashe	247	" Very little ! "
164070	164108	164015	164016	The Dean	277	" My mother got some information from the English consul at Trieste , who is a friend of hers -- to whom , it seems , Lady Kitty applied ; but it did not amount to much . "
164130	164152	164015	164016	The Dean	277	" They seem to have reached Marinitza in November If I understood aright , Lady Kitty had no maid with her ? "
164153	164165	164180	164181	the Dean	987	" No . The maid Blanche was sent home from Verona . "
164166	164178	164185	164185	his	987	" How Lady Kitty ever got through the journey!--or the winter ! "
164188	164287	164299	164299	Ashe	243	" Her health , of course , is irreparably injured . But that she did not die a dozen times over , of hardship and misery , is the most astonishing thing ! They were in a wretched village , nearly four thousand feet up , a village of wooden huts , with a wooden hospital . All the winter nearly they were deep in snow , and Lady Kitty worked as a nurse . Cliffe seems to have been away fighting , very often , and at other times came back to rest and see to supplies . "
164288	164297	164654	164654	he	987	" I understand she passed as his wife ? "
164310	164579	164585	164585	Ashe	243	" They lived in a little house near the hospital . She tells me that after the first two months she began to loathe him , and she moved into the hospital to escape him . He tried at first to melt and propitiate her ; but when he found that it was no use , and that she was practically lost to him , he changed his temper , and he might have behaved to her like the tyrant he is but that her hold over the people among whom they were living , both on the fighting - men and the women , had become by this time greater than his own . They adored her , and Cliffe dared not ill - treat her . And so it went on through the winter . Sometimes they were on more friendly terms than at others . I gather that when he showed his dare - devil , heroic side she would relent to him , and talk as though she loved him . But she would never go back -- to live with him ; and that after a time alienated him completely . He was away more and more ; and at last she tells me there was a handsome Bosnian girl , and -- well , you can imagine the rest . Lady Kitty was so ill in March that they thought her dying , but she managed to write to this consul you spoke of at Trieste , and he sent up a doctor and a nurse . But this you probably know ? "
164580	164583	164585	164585	Ashe	243	" Yes , "
164589	164620	164638	164639	the Dean	987	" I heard that she was apparently very ill when she reached Treviso , but that she had rallied under Alice 's nursing . Lady Alice wrote to my mother . "
164621	164636	164654	164654	he	987	" Did she tell Lady Tranmore anything of Lady Kitty 's state of mind ? "
164657	164669	164675	164676	the Dean	987	" I understand there has been great regret for the past . "
164670	164673	164675	164676	the Dean	987	" Regret ! "
164678	164695	164719	164719	Ashe	243	" If ever there was a terrible case of the dealings of God with a human soul-- "
164709	164717	164654	164654	he	987	" Did she give you any explanation , "
164727	164781	164921	164921	His	4955	audible--"of their meeting at Verona ? You know my mother believed -- that she had broken with him -- that all was saved . Then came a letter from the maid , written at Kitty 's direction , to say that she had left her mistress -- and they had started for Bosnia . "
164782	164842	164852	164853	the Dean	987	" No ; I tried . But she seemed to shrink with horror from everything to do with Verona . I have always supposed that fellow in some way got the information he wanted -- bought it no doubt -- and pursued her . But that she honestly meant to break with him I have no doubt at all . "
164847	164850	164852	164853	the Dean	987	" Think , "
164855	164884	164921	164921	His	4955	" of the effect of that man 's sudden appearance -- of his romantic and powerful personality -- your wife alone , miserable -- doubting your love for her-- "
164895	164920	164939	164939	He	987	" If she had had the smallest love left for me she could have protected herself ! I had written to her -- she knew-- "
164931	164938	164947	164947	he	987	" My dear fellow -- God knows-- "
164950	165015	165039	165039	he	987	" Let us go back to Lady Kitty . Regret is no word to express what I saw . She is consumed by remorse night and day . She is also still -- as far as my eyes can judge -- desperately ill . There is probably lung trouble caused by the privations of the winter . And the whole nervous system is shattered . "
165029	165038	165039	165039	he	987	" Every provision shall be made for her , "
165049	165069	165085	165086	the Dean	987	" Lady Alice has been told already to spare no expense -- to do everything that can be done . "
165070	165083	165111	165112	the Dean	987	" There is only one thing that can be done for her , "
165093	165110	165111	165112	the Dean	987	" There is only one thing that you or any one else could do for her , "
165117	165128	165147	165147	Ashe	243	" and that is to love -- and forgive her ! "
165133	165145	165204	165204	his	987	" Was it her wish that you should come to me ? "
165153	165192	165213	165213	his	987	" Yes . I found her at first very despairing -- and extremely difficult to manage . She regretted she had written to me , and neither Lady Alice nor I could get her to talk . But one day"--the
165214	165428	165476	165476	he	987	story--"one day , whether it was , the sight of a paralyzed child that used to come to Lady Alice 's lace - class , or some impression from the service of the mass to which she often goes in the early mornings with her sister , I do n't know , but she sent for me -- and -- and broke down entirely . She implored me to see you , and to ask you if she might live at Haggart , near the child 's grave . She told me that according to every doctor she has seen she is doomed , physically . But I do n't think she wants to work upon your pity . She herself declares that she has much more vitality than people think , and that the doctors may be all wrong . So that you are not to take that into account . But if you will so far forgive her as to let her live at Haggart , and occasionally to go and see her , that would be the only happiness to which she could now look forward , and she promises that she will follow your wishes in every respect , and will not hinder or persecute you in any way . "
165470	165475	165476	165476	he	987	" For my part , "
165481	165499	165530	165530	he	987	" I am not going to advise you for a moment to trust to any such promise . "
165526	165529	165530	165530	he	987	" But , "
165533	165549	165550	165550	Ashe	243	" I none the less urge and implore you to grant Lady Kitty 's prayer . "
165563	165585	165550	165550	Ashe	243	" May I speak to you -- with a full frankness ? I have known and loved you from a boy . And"--he
165593	165599	165629	165629	he	4959	simply--"I am a Christian minister . "
165619	165628	165646	165647	the Dean	987	" I can only be grateful to you , "
165636	165644	165646	165647	the Dean	987	" At least you will understand me , "
165649	165775	165787	165787	Ashe	243	" You are not one of the small souls . Well -- here it is ! Lady Kitty has been an unfaithful wife . She does not attempt to deny or cover it . But in my belief she loves you still , and has always loved you . And when you married her , you must , I think , have realized that you were running no ordinary risks . The position and antecedents of her mother -- the bringing up of the poor child herself -- the wildness of her temperament , and the absence of anything like self - discipline and self - control , must surely have made you anxious ? I certainly remember that Lady Tranmore was full of fears . "
165782	165785	165787	165787	Ashe	243	" Yes , "
165789	165819	165820	165821	The Dean	987	" I was anxious . Or , rather , I saw the risks clearly . But I was in love , and I thought that love could do everything . "
165834	165855	165884	165884	he	4967	" Forgive me . Did you take your task seriously enough?--did you give Lady Kitty all the help you might ? "
165877	165883	165884	165884	he	4967	" I know very well , "
165889	165926	165938	165939	the Dean	987	" that I seemed to you and others a weak and self - indulgent fool . All I can say is , it was not in me to play the tutor and master to my wife . "
165927	165936	165938	165939	the Dean	987	" She was so young , so undisciplined , "
165943	165952	165972	165972	he	987	" Did you guard her as you might ? "
165961	165971	165972	165972	he	987	" Do you really think , my dear Dean , "
165984	166024	166025	166026	The Dean	987	" that one human being has , ultimately , any decisive power over another ? If so , I am more of a believer in -- fate -- or liberty -- I am not sure which -- than you . "
166029	166043	166051	166051	Ashe	243	" That you were infinitely good and loving to her we all know . "
166044	166049	166051	166051	Ashe	243	" ' Good'--'loving ' ? "
166063	166065	166091	166091	himself	987	" I-- "
166097	166150	166192	166192	him	987	" My dear friend -- you saw the risks , and yet you took them ! You made the vow ' for better , for worse . ' My friend , you have , so to speak , lost your venture ! But let me urge on you that the obligation remains ! "
166151	166155	166179	166180	the Dean	987	" What obligation ? "
166156	166177	166192	166192	him	987	" The obligation to the life you took into your own hands -- to the soul you vowed to cherish , "
166201	166228	166239	166240	the Dean	987	" That obligation -- has been cancelled -- by the laws of your own Christian faith , no less than by the ordinary laws of society . "
166229	166237	166239	166240	the Dean	987	" I do not so read it ! "
166245	166289	166298	166298	Ashe	243	" Men say so , ' for the hardness of their hearts . ' But the divine pity which transformed men 's idea of marriage could never have meant to lay it down that in marriage alone there was to be no forgiveness . "
166290	166296	166298	166298	Ashe	243	" You forget your text , "
166302	166308	166319	166320	the Dean	987	" Saving for the cause-- ' "
166314	166317	166319	166320	the Dean	987	" Permissive ! "
166323	166448	166469	166469	Ashe	243	reply--"permissive only . There are cases , I grant you -- cases of impenitent wickedness -- where the higher law is suspended , finds no chance to act -- where relief from the bond is itself mercy and justice . But the higher law is always there . You know the formula--'It was said by them of old time . But _ I _ say unto you-- ' And then follows the new law of a new society . And so in marriage . If love has the smallest room to work -- if forgiveness can find the narrowest foothold -- love and forgiveness are imposed on -- demanded of -- the Christian!--here as everywhere else . Love and forgiveness--_not _ penalty and hate ! "
166449	166467	166500	166500	he	987	" There is no question of hate -- and -- I doubt whether I am a Christian , "
166488	166499	166514	166514	he	987	" But you are a _ heart _ , William ! "
166525	166606	166634	166634	he	4976	before--"ay , and one of the noblest . You gathered that poor thing into your arms -- knowing what were the temptations of her nature , and she became the mother of your child . Now -- alas ! those temptations have conquered her . But she still turns to you -- she still clings to you -- and she has no one else . And if you reject her she will go down unforgiven and despairing to the grave . "
166625	166633	166634	166634	he	4976	" I must try and explain myself , "
166637	166964	166974	166975	the Dean	987	" Why should we talk of forgiveness ? It is not a word that I much understand , or that means much to men of my type and generation . I see what has happened in this way . Kitty 's conduct last year hit me desperately hard . It destroyed my private happiness , and but for the generosity of the best friends ever man had it would have driven me out of public life . I warned her that the consequences of the Cliffe matter would be irreparable , and she still carried it through . She left me for that man -- and at a time when by her own action it was impossible for me to defend either her or myself . What course of action remained to me ? I _ did _ remember her temperament , her antecedents , and the certainty that this man , whatever might be his moments of heroism , was a selfish and incorrigible brute in his dealings with women . So I wrote to her , through this same consul at Trieste . I let her know that if she wished it , and if there were any chance of his marrying her , I would begin divorce proceedings at once . She had only to say the word . If she did not wish it , I would spare her and myself the shame and scandal of publicity . And if she left him , I would make additional provision for her which would insure her every comfort . She never sent a word of reply , and I have taken no steps . But as soon as I heard she was at Treviso , I wrote again -- or , rather , this time my lawyers wrote , suggesting that the time had come for the extra provision I had spoken of , which I was most ready and anxious to make . "
166968	166972	166974	166975	the Dean	987	" And this , "
166977	166992	167004	167004	he	4977	" is all ? This is , in fact , your answer to me ? "
167000	167003	167004	167004	he	4977	" Except , "
167010	167098	166993	166993	Ashe	243	" that I have heard , only to - day , that if Kitty wishes it , her old friend Miss French will go out to her at once , nurse her , and travel with her as long as she pleases . Miss French 's brother has just married , and she is at liberty . She is most deeply attached to Kitty , and as soon as she heard Lady Alice 's report of her state she forgot everything else . Can you not persuade -- Kitty"--he
167101	167106	167114	167115	the Dean	987	urgently--"to accept her offer ? "
167107	167112	167114	167115	the Dean	987	" I doubt it , "
167119	167164	167185	167185	Ashe	243	" There is only one thing she pines for , and without it she will be a sick child crossed . Ah ! well -- well ! So to allow her to share your life again -- however humbly and intermittently -- is impossible ? "
167180	167183	167185	167185	Ashe	243	" Impossible , "
167189	167197	166993	166993	Ashe	243	" But not only for private reasons . "
167198	167209	167185	167185	Ashe	243	" You mean your public duty stands in the way ? "
167210	167275	166993	166993	Ashe	243	" Kitty left me of her own free will . I have put my hand to the plough again -- and I can not turn back . You can see for yourself that I am not at my own disposal -- I belong to my party , to the men with whom I act , who have behaved to me with the utmost generosity . "
167276	167296	167185	167185	Ashe	243	" Of course Lady Kitty could no longer share your public life . But at Haggart -- in seclusion ? "
167297	167342	166993	166993	Ashe	243	" You know what her personality is -- how absorbing -- how impossible to forget ! No -- if she returned to me , on any terms whatever , all the old conditions would begin again . I should inevitably have to leave politics . "
167343	167354	166993	166993	Ashe	243	" And that -- you are not prepared to do ? "
167374	167401	167462	167465	a lady in black	4986	" I should have preferred to put it that I have accepted great tasks and heavy responsibilities -- and that I am not my own master . "
167420	167429	167482	167482	she	4986	" went away sorrowful , having great possessions , "
167473	167481	167482	167482	she	4986	" Do you forbid me , William ? "
167485	167492	167536	167536	he	277	quietly--"or may I join your conversation ? "
167524	167535	167560	167560	she	222	" You have come to us at a critical moment , "
167537	167546	167736	167736	he	987	said--"and I am afraid you are against me . "
167730	167735	167746	167747	Lady Tranmore	222	" There -- there ! "
167754	167766	167775	167776	Lady Tranmore	222	" I see you both think me a dreamer of dreams ! "
167767	167773	167775	167776	Lady Tranmore	222	" Nay , dear friend ! "
167795	167810	167822	167823	the Dean	987	" these things seem possible to you , because you are the soul of goodness-- "
167811	167820	167822	167823	the Dean	987	" And a pious old fool to boot ! "
167827	167861	167868	167868	she	222	" But I am willing -- like St. Paul and my betters -- to be a fool for Christ 's sake . Lady Tranmore , are you or are you not a Christian ? "
167862	167867	167868	167868	she	222	" I hope so , "
167879	167910	167930	167931	the Dean	987	" But our Lord did not ask impossibilities . He knew there were limits to human endurance -- and human pardon -- though there might be none to God 's . "
167911	167928	167930	167931	the Dean	987	" ' Be ye perfect , as your Father which is in heaven is perfect , ' "
167933	167940	167960	167960	she	222	" Where are the limits there ? "
167941	167959	167960	167960	she	222	" There are other duties in life besides that to a wife who has betrayed her husband , "
167965	168013	168020	168020	Ashe	219	" You ask of William what he has not the strength to give . His life was wrecked , and he has pieced it together again . And now he has given it to his country . That poor , guilty child has no claim upon it . "
168014	168018	167960	167960	she	222	" But understand , "
168033	168062	168087	168087	he	987	man--"while I live , _ everything_--short of what you ask -- that can be done to protect or ease her , shall be done . Tell her that . "
168077	168086	168087	168087	he	987	" And may I tell her , too , "
168090	168095	168106	168106	he	987	pausing--"that you forgive her ? "
168099	168105	168106	168106	he	987	" I do not believe , "
168112	168139	168322	168322	he	987	" that she would attach any more meaning to that word than I do . She would think it unreal . What 's done is done . "
168300	168306	168322	168322	he	987	" One thing thou lackest , "
168309	168315	168713	168714	the Dean	987	" Come , follow me ! "
168706	168711	168788	168788	he	277	" _ Fermate ! _ "

169181	169227	169272	169272	she	243	" Frightfully excited -- or else dumb . She let me give her something to make her sleep . Strangely enough , she said to me this morning on the way from Treviso : ' It is a woman -- and I know her ! ' "
169265	169271	169272	169272	she	243	" Is n't it horrible ? "
169287	169319	169341	169341	he	987	" She tried once , in Bosnia . One of the Italians who came out with us -- she had got hold of him . Do you think -- he suffered ? "
169330	169340	169360	169360	He	987	" One of the stabs was in the heart , "
169344	169359	169377	169377	she	243	" But try and put it from you , Lady Kitty . Sit down . "
169371	169376	169360	169360	He	987	" Ah , then , "
169378	169393	169526	169526	She	243	said--"_then _ he could n't have suffered -- could he ? I 'm glad . "
169542	169554	169579	169579	Kitty	243	" I thought he would n't . Was Lady Tranmore there ? "
169565	169577	169579	169579	Kitty	243	" Ah , then , of course there was no chance , "
169581	169594	169595	169595	She	243	" When one is as good as that , one never forgives . "
169600	169608	169609	169610	The Dean	987	" Did William say he forgave me ? "
169613	169625	169654	169654	She	243	" He said a great deal that was kind and generous . "
169635	169653	169654	169654	She	243	" I suppose he thought it ridiculous to talk of forgiving . So did I -- once . "
169669	169702	169710	169711	the Dean	987	" One ca n't go on being sorry every moment of the day . No , one ca n't ! Why are we made so ? William would agree with me there . "
169703	169708	169710	169711	the Dean	987	" Dear Lady Kitty ! "
169713	169728	169744	169744	she	243	tenderly--"God forgives -- and with Him there is always hope , and fresh beginning . "
169734	169743	169744	169744	she	243	" I do n't know what that means , "
169747	169750	169744	169744	she	243	" I wonder whether"--she

169942	169951	169952	169952	she	366	" I must think what I shall do , "

173297	173419	173431	173431	He	5175	" The Christian -- in speculative belief -- fails under the challenge of life as often as other men . Surely it depends on something infinitely more primitive and fundamental than Christianity?--something out of which Christianity itself springs ? But this something -- does it really exist -- or am I only cheating myself by fancying it ? Is it , as all the sages have said , the pursuit of some eternal good , the identification of the self with it -- the ' dying to live ' ? And is this the real meaning at the heart of Christianity?--at the heart of all religion?--the everlasting meaning , let science play what havoc it please with outward forms and statements ? "

175807	175812	175813	175813	she	243	" You forbade me , "
175820	175921	175938	175938	he	5058	" And it was quite right . The dear Dean told me -- and I quite understood . If I 'd gone to Haggart then there 'd have been more trouble . I should have tried to get my old place back . And now it 's all over . You can give me all I want , because I ca n't live . It 's only a question of months , perhaps weeks . Nobody could blame you , could they ? People do n't laugh when -- it 's death . It simplifies things so -- doesn't it ? "

175952	175991	176020	176020	he	5058	" It was Bosnia first , and then -- being miserable -- I suppose . And Poitiers was very cold -- and the nuns very stuffy , bless them -- they would n't let me have air enough . "
176013	176019	175922	175922	She	243	" Where have you been ? "
176023	176046	175922	175922	She	243	" Oh ! I went to the Soeurs Blanches -- you remember?--where I used to be . You went there , did n't you?"--he
176052	176130	176184	176184	She	5299	assent--"but I made them promise not to tell ! There was an old mistress of novices there still who used to be very fond of me . She got one of the houses of the Sacré Coeur to take me in -- at Poitiers . They thought they were gathering a stray sheep back into the fold , you understand , as I was brought up a Catholic -- of sorts . And I did n't mind ! "
176148	176183	176184	176184	She	5299	" I used to like going to mass . But this Easter they wanted to make me ' go to my duties'--you know what it means?--and I would n't . I wanted to confess . "
176193	176385	176574	176574	She	243	again--"but only once -- to -- you -- and then , well then , to die , and have done with it . You see , I knew one ca n't get on long with three - quarters of a lung . And they were rather tiresome -- they did n't understand . So three weeks ago I drew some money out and said good - bye to them . Oh ! they were very kind , and very sorry for me . They wanted me to take a maid , and I meant to . But the one they found would n't come with me when she saw how ill I was -- and it all lingered on -- so one day I just walked out to the railway - station and went to Paris . But Paris was rainy -- and I felt I must see the sun again . So I stayed two nights at a little hotel maman used to go to -- horrid place!--and each night I read your speeches in the reading - room -- and then I got my things from Poitiers , and started-- "

176845	176933	176942	176942	he	5315	" Oh ! I shall find one at Florence if I get there -- or a nurse . But just for these few days I wanted to be free ! In the winter there were so many people about -- so many eyes ! I just pined to cheat them -- get quit of them . A maid would have bothered me to stay in bed and see doctors -- and you know , William , with this illness of mine you 're so _ restless _ ! "
176934	176941	176816	176816	she	243	" Where were you going to ? "
176949	176972	176986	176986	she	5316	" Oh ! to Italy somewhere -- just to see some flowers again -- and the sun . Only not to Venice ! "
176993	177013	176979	176979	she	5316	" William ! you know -- I was coming home to you , when that man -- found me . "
177014	177028	177036	177036	she	5316	" I know . If it had only been I who killed him ! "
177029	177035	177036	177036	she	5316	" I 'm just--_Kitty _ ! "
177039	177057	176979	176979	she	5316	choking--"as bad as bad can be . But I could n't have done what Mary Lyster did . "
177058	177066	177075	177075	she	5316	" Kitty -- for God 's sake ! "
177067	177074	177075	177075	she	5316	" Oh , I know it , "
177080	177147	177075	177075	she	5316	triumph--"now I _ know _ it . I determined to know -- and I got people in Venice to find out . She sent the message -- that told him where I was -- and I know the man who took it . I suppose it would be pathetic if I sent her word that I had forgiven her . But I _ have n't _ ! "

177263	177372	177816	177816	Ashe	219	" I was so weak -- and frightened . And _ he _ said , it was no good trying to go back to you . Everybody knew I had gone to Verona -- and he had followed me -- No one would ever believe -- And he would n't go -- wouldn't leave me . It would be mere cruelty and desertion , he said . My real life was -- with him . And I seemed -- paralyzed . Who _ had _ sent that message ? It never occurred to me -- I felt as if some demon held me -- and I could n't escape-- "
177736	177815	177827	177827	she	5333	" He was a stranger -- no one knew him in the village -- no one cared . They had their own griefs . I dressed his wound -- and gave him water . He thought I was his mother , and asked me to kiss him . I kissed him , William -- and he smiled once -- before the last hemorrhage . If you had seen the cold , dismal room -- and his poor face ! "

William , dear!--I have n't had a brain like other people . I know it . It 's only since I 've been so ill -- that I 've been sane ! It 's a strange feeling -- as though one had been _ bled_--and some poison had drained away . But it would never do for me to take a turn and live ! Oh no!--people like me are better safely under the grass . Oh , my beloved ! my beloved ! I just want to say that all the time , and nothing else -- I've hungered so to say it ! "

There!--that was foolish!--I'm better . It is n't only the lungs , you see ; they say the heart 's worst . I nearly went at Vevey , one night . It was such a long faint . "
