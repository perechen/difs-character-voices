If I am neither a hard man nor a very close one , God knows I have had no lack of rubbing and pounding to make stone of me . Yet can I not somehow believe that we ought to hate one another , to live far asunder , and block the mouth each of his little den ; as do the wild beasts of the wood , and the hairy outrangs now brought over , each with a chain upon him . Let that matter be as it will . It is beyond me to unfold , and mayhap of my grandson 's grandson . All I know is that wheat is better than when I began to sow it .

2497	2582	2494	2494	them	750	' sons , young grocers , fellmongers , and poulterers , and these to their credit seemed to know how righteous it was to kick them . But others were of high family , as any need be , in Devon Carews , and Bouchiers , and Bastards , and some of these would turn sometimes , and strike the boy that kicked them . But to do them justice , even these knew that they must be kicked for not paying . After these '
2586	2596	2494	2494	them	750	' were gone , as in contumely we called them '
2606	2610	2598	2598	you	754	' said one , '
2619	3069	2598	2598	you	754	' and after old Cop with clang of iron had jammed the double gates in under the scruff - stone archway , whereupon are Latin verses , done in brass of small quality , some of us who were not hungry , and cared not for the supper - bell , having sucked much parliament and dumps at my only charges not that I ever bore much wealth , but because I had been thrifting it for this time of my birth we were leaning quite at dusk against the iron bars of the gate some six , or it may be seven of us , small boys all , and not conspicuous in the closing of the daylight and the fog that came at eventide , else Cop would have rated us up the green , for he was churly to little boys when his wife had taken their money . There was plenty of room for all of us , for the gate will hold nine boys close - packed , unless they be fed rankly , whereof is little danger ; and now we were looking out on the road and wishing we could get there ; hoping , moreover , to see a good string of pack - horses come by , with troopers to protect them . For the day - boys had brought us word that some intending their way to the town had lain that morning at Sampford Peveril , and must be in ere nightfall , because Mr. Faggus was after them . Now Mr. Faggus was my first cousin and an honour to the family , being a Northmolton man of great renown on the highway from Barum town even to London . Therefore of course , I hoped that he would catch the packmen , and the boys were asking my opinion as of an oracle , about it . A certain boy leaning up against me would not allow my elbow room , and struck me very sadly in the stomach part , though his own was full of my parliament . And this I felt so unkindly , that I smote him straightway in the face without tarrying to consider it , or weighing the question duly . Upon this he put his head down , and presented it so vehemently at the middle of my waistcoat , that for a minute or more my breath seemed dropped , as it were , from my pockets , and my life seemed to stop from great want of ease . Before I came to myself again , it had been settled for us that we should move to the '
3074	3190	2598	2598	you	754	' as the triangle of turf is called where the two causeways coming from the school - porch and the hall - porch meet , and our fights are mainly celebrated ; only we must wait until the convoy of horses had passed , and then make a ring by candlelight , and the other boys would like it . But suddenly there came round the post where the letters of our founder are , not from the way of Taunton but from the side of Lowman bridge , a very small string of horses , only two indeed counting for one the pony , and a red - faced man on the bigger nag .

7737	8155	8156	8158	Good leetle boy	897	' scape the mark that God took thought to make a girl of him . Not so when they grow older , and court the regard of the maidens ; then may the bravery pass from the inside to the outside of them ; and no bigger fools are they , even then , than their fathers were before them . But God forbid any man to be a fool to love , and be loved , as I have been . Else would he have prevented it . When the mutton pasty was done , and Peggy and Smiler had dined well also , out I went to wash at the pump , being a lover of soap and water , at all risk , except of my dinner . And John Fry , who cared very little to wash , save Sabbath days in his own soap , and who had kept me from the pump by threatening loss of the dish , out he came in a satisfied manner , with a piece of quill in his hand , to lean against a door - post , and listen to the horses feeding , and have his teeth ready for supper . Then a lady's - maid came out , and the sun was on her face , and she turned round to go back again ; but put a better face upon it , and gave a trip and hitched her dress , and looked at the sun full body , lest the hostlers should laugh that she was losing her complexion . With a long Italian glass in her fingers very daintily , she came up to the pump in the middle of the yard , where I was running the water off all my head and shoulders , and arms , and some of my breast even , and though I had glimpsed her through the sprinkle , it gave me quite a turn to see her , child as I was , in my open aspect . But she looked at me , no whit abashed , making a baby of me , no doubt , as a woman of thirty will do , even with a very big boy when they catch him on a hayrick , and she said to me in a brazen manner , as if I had been nobody , while I was shrinking behind the pump , and craving to get my shirt on , '
8218	8299	8213	8213	you	897	' All this time she was touching my breast , here and there , very lightly , with her delicate brown fingers , and I understood from her voice and manner that she was not of this country , but a foreigner by extraction . And then I was not so shy of her , because I could talk better English than she ; and yet I longed for my jerkin , but liked not to be rude to her . '

8498	9404	9405	9406	murdering Papishers	915	' I did not know what she meant by that ; yet I pumped for her very heartily , and marvelled to see her for fifty times throw the water away in the trough , as if it was not good enough . At last the water suited her , with a likeness of fog outside the glass , and the gleam of a crystal under it , and then she made a curtsey to me , in a sort of mocking manner , holding the long glass by the foot , not to take the cloud off ; and then she wanted to kiss me ; but I was out of breath , and have always been shy of that work , except when I come to offer it ; and so I ducked under the pump - handle , and she knocked her chin on the knob of it ; and the hostlers came out , and asked whether they would do as well . Upon this , she retreated up the yard , with a certain dark dignity , and a foreign way of walking , which stopped them at once from going farther , because it was so different from the fashion of their sweethearts . One with another they hung back , where half a cart - load of hay was , and they looked to be sure that she would not turn round ; and then each one laughed at the rest of them . Now , up to the end of Dulverton town , on the northward side of it , where the two new pig - sties be , the Oare folk and the Watchett folk must trudge on together , until we come to a broken cross , where a murdered man lies buried . Peggy and Smiler went up the hill , as if nothing could be too much for them , after the beans they had eaten , and suddenly turning a corner of trees , we happened upon a great coach and six horses labouring very heavily . John Fry rode on with his hat in his hand , as became him towards the quality ; but I was amazed to that degree , that I left my cap on my head , and drew bridle without knowing it . For in the front seat of the coach , which was half - way open , being of the city - make , and the day in want of air , sate the foreign lady , who had met me at the pump and offered to salute me . By her side was a little girl , dark - haired and very wonderful , with a wealthy softness on her , as if she must have her own way . I could not look at her for two glances , and she did not look at me for one , being such a little child , and busy with the hedges . But in the honourable place sate a handsome lady , very warmly dressed , and sweetly delicate of colour . And close to her was a lively child , two or it may be three years old , bearing a white cockade in his hat , and staring at all and everybody . Now , he saw Peggy , and took such a liking to her , that the lady his mother if so she were was forced to look at my pony and me . And , to tell the truth , although I am not of those who adore the high folk , she looked at us very kindly , and with a sweetness rarely found in the women who milk the cows for us . Then I took off my cap to the beautiful lady , without asking wherefore ; and she put up her hand and kissed it to me , thinking , perhaps , that I looked like a gentle and good little boy ; for folk always called me innocent , though God knows I never was that . But now the foreign lady , or lady 's maid , as it might be , who had been busy with little dark eyes , turned upon all this going - on , and looked me straight in the face . I was about to salute her , at a distance , indeed , and not with the nicety she had offered to me , but , strange to say , she stared at my eyes as if she had never seen me before , neither wished to see me again . At this I was so startled , such things beings out of my knowledge , that I startled Peggy also with the muscle of my legs , and she being fresh from stable , and the mire scraped off with cask - hoop , broke away so suddenly that I could do no more than turn round and lower my cap , now five months old , to the beautiful lady . Soon I overtook John Fry , and asked him all about them , and how it was that we had missed their starting from the hostel . But John would never talk much till after a gallon of cider ; and all that I could win out of him was that they were '
9408	9715	9405	9406	murdering Papishers	915	' and little he cared to do with them , or the devil , as they came from . And a good thing for me , and a providence , that I was gone down Dulverton town to buy sweetstuff for Annie , else my stupid head would have gone astray with their great out - coming . We saw no more of them after that , but turned into the sideway ; and soon had the fill of our hands and eyes to look to our own going . For the road got worse and worse , until there was none at all , and perhaps the purest thing it could do was to be ashamed to show itself . But we pushed on as best we might , with doubt of reaching home any time , except by special grace of God . The fog came down upon the moors as thick as ever I saw it ; and there was no sound of any sort , nor a breath of wind to guide us . The little stubby trees that stand here and there , like bushes with a wooden leg to them , were drizzled with a mess of wet , and hung their points with dropping . Wherever the butt - end of a hedgerow came up from the hollow ground , like the withers of a horse , holes of splash were pocked and pimpled in the yellow sand of coneys , or under the dwarf tree 's ovens . But soon it was too dark to see that , or anything else , I may say , except the creases in the dusk , where prisoned light crept up the valleys . After awhile even that was gone , and no other comfort left us except to see our horses '

At first there was nothing to hear , except the panting of the horses and the trickle of the eaving drops from our head - covers and clothing , and the soft sounds of the lonely night , that make us feel , and try not to think . Then there came a mellow noise , very low and mournsome , not a sound to be afraid of , but to long to know the meaning , with a soft rise of the hair . Three times it came and went again , as the shaking of a thread might pass away into the distance ; and then I touched John Fry to know that there was something near me . '

10509	10610	10421	10421	John	274	' John Fry shook his bridle - arm , and smote upon Smiler merrily , as he jogged into the homeward track from the guiding of the body . But I was sorry for Red Jem , and wanted to know more about him , and whether he might not have avoided this miserable end , and what his wife and children thought of it , if , indeed , he had any . But John would talk no more about it ; and perhaps he was moved with a lonesome feeling , as the creaking sound came after us . '
10617	10622	10421	10421	John	274	' he said sharply ; '

10733	10746	10731	10731	John	274	' I whispered warily , sidling close to his saddle - bow ; '

10810	10879	10794	10794	Zober	294	' For I was inclined , in the manner of boys , to make a run of the danger , and cross the Doone - track at full speed ; to rush for it , and be done with it . But even then I wondered why he talked of my mother so , and said not a word of father . We were come to a long deep '
10882	10920	10794	10794	Zober	294	' as they call it on Exmoor , a word whose fountain and origin I have nothing to do with . Only I know that when little boys laughed at me at Tiverton , for talking about a '
10923	10967	10794	10794	Zober	294	' a big boy clouted them on the head , and said that it was in Homer , and meant the hollow of the hand . And another time a Welshman told me that it must be something like the thing they call a '
10969	11112	11131	11132	weary men	946	' in those parts . Still I know what it means well enough to wit , a long trough among wild hills , falling towards the plain country , rounded at the bottom , perhaps , and stiff , more than steep , at the sides of it . Whether it be straight or crooked , makes no difference to it . We rode very carefully down our side , and through the soft grass at the bottom , and all the while we listened as if the air was a speaking - trumpet . Then gladly we breasted our nags to the rise , and were coming to the comb of it , when I heard something , and caught John 's arm , and he bent his hand to the shape of his ear . It was the sound of horses '
11161	11181	11183	11184	John Fry	274	' God 's sake , Jack , slip round her belly , and let her go where she wull . '

11497	12039	11494	11494	God	268	' For I could keep still no longer , but wriggled away from his arm , and along the little gullet , still going flat on my breast and thighs , until I was under a grey patch of stone , with a fringe of dry fern round it ; there I lay , scarce twenty feet above the heads of the riders , and I feared to draw my breath , though prone to do it with wonder . For now the beacon was rushing up , in a fiery storm to heaven , and the form of its flame came and went in the folds , and the heavy sky was hovering . All around it was hung with red , deep in twisted columns , and then a giant beard of fire streamed throughout the darkness . The sullen hills were flanked with light , and the valleys chined with shadow , and all the sombrous moors between awoke in furrowed anger . But most of all the flinging fire leaped into the rocky mouth of the glen below me , where the horsemen passed in silence , scarcely deigning to look round . Heavy men and large of stature , reckless how they bore their guns , or how they sate their horses , with leathern jerkins , and long boots , and iron plates on breast and head , plunder heaped behind their saddles , and flagons slung in front of them ; I counted more than thirty pass , like clouds upon red sunset . Some had carcasses of sheep swinging with their skins on , others had deer , and one had a child flung across his saddle - bow . Whether the child were dead , or alive , was more than I could tell , only it hung head downwards there , and must take the chance of it . They had got the child , a very young one , for the sake of the dress , no doubt , which they could not stop to pull off from it ; for the dress shone bright , where the fire struck it , as if with gold and jewels . I longed in my heart to know most sadly what they would do with the little thing , and whether they would eat it . It touched me so to see that child , a prey among those vultures , that in my foolish rage and burning I stood up and shouted to them leaping on a rock , and raving out of all possession . Two of them turned round , and one set his carbine at me , but the other said it was but a pixie , and bade him keep his powder . Little they knew , and less thought I , that the pixie then before them would dance their castle down one day . John Fry , who in the spring of fright had brought himself down from Smiler 's side , as if he were dipped in oil , now came up to me , all risk being over , cross , and stiff , and aching sorely from his wet couch of heather .

12107	12328	12330	12330	your	960	' And that was all he had to say , instead of thanking God ! For if ever born man was in a fright , and ready to thank God for anything , the name of that man was John Fry not more than five minutes agone . However , I answered nothing at all , except to be ashamed of myself ; and soon we found Peggy and Smiler in company , well embarked on the homeward road , and victualling where the grass was good . Right glad they were to see us again not for the pleasure of carrying , but because a horse like a woman lacks , and is better without , self - reliance . My father never came to meet us , at either side of the telling - house , neither at the crooked post , nor even at home - linhay although the dogs kept such a noise that he must have heard us . Home - side of the linhay , and under the ashen hedge - row , where father taught me to catch blackbirds , all at once my heart went down , and all my breast was hollow . There was not even the lanthorn light on the peg against the cow 's house , and nobody said '
12333	12340	12330	12330	your	960	' to the dogs , or shouted '
12346	12464	12465	12465	He	963	' I looked at the posts of the gate , in the dark , because they were tall , like father , and then at the door of the harness - room , where he used to smoke his pipe and sing . Then I thought he had guests perhaps people lost upon the moors whom he could not leave unkindly , even for his son 's sake . And yet about that I was jealous , and ready to be vexed with him , when he should begin to make much of me . And I felt in my pocket for the new pipe which I had brought him from Tiverton , and said to myself , '
12476	12607	12465	12465	He	963	' Woe is me ! I can not tell . How I knew I know not now only that I slunk away , without a tear , or thought of weeping , and hid me in a saw - pit . There the timber , over - head , came like streaks across me ; and all I wanted was to lack , and none to tell me anything . By - and - by , a noise came down , as of woman 's weeping ; and there my mother and sister were , choking and holding together . Although they were my dearest loves , I could not bear to look at them , until they seemed to want my help , and put their hands before their eyes .

15492	15592	15482	15483	the Counsellor	1087	' Master John Ridd , as I understand . Counsellor , we have heard of him often ; a worthy man and a peaceful one , who meddled not with our duties . Now , if any of our boys have been rough , they shall answer it dearly . And yet I can scarce believe it . For the folk about these parts are apt to misconceive of our sufferings , and to have no feeling for us . Counsellor , you are our record , and very stern against us ; tell us how this matter was . '
15593	15598	15599	15600	my mother	683	' Oh , Counsellor ! '
15603	15653	15599	15600	my mother	683	' Sir Counsellor , you will be fair : I see it in your countenance . Only tell me who it was , and set me face to face with him , and I will bless you , sir , and God shall bless you , and my children . '
15692	15907	15677	15677	his	1096	' Few words will be enow for this . Four or five of our best - behaved and most peaceful gentlemen went to the little market at Porlock with a lump of money . They bought some household stores and comforts at a very high price , and pricked upon the homeward road , away from vulgar revellers . When they drew bridle to rest their horses , in the shelter of a peat - rick , the night being dark and sudden , a robber of great size and strength rode into the midst of them , thinking to kill or terrify . His arrogance and hardihood at the first amazed them , but they would not give up without a blow goods which were on trust with them . He had smitten three of them senseless , for the power of his arm was terrible ; whereupon the last man tried to ward his blow with a pistol . Carver , sir , it was , our brave and noble Carver , who saved the lives of his brethren and his own ; and glad enow they were to escape . Notwithstanding , we hoped it might be only a flesh - wound , and not to speed him in his sins . '

16125	16141	16042	16044	the old man	1080	' Without doubt his land is attainted ; unless is mercy you forbear , sir . '
16142	16197	16042	16044	the old man	1080	' Counsellor , we will forbear . Madam , we will forgive him . Like enough he knew not right from wrong , at that time of night . The waters are strong at Porlock , and even an honest man may use his staff unjustly in this unchartered age of violence and rapine . '
16337	16343	16344	16344	he	1109	' Captain sends you this , '
16347	16355	16344	16344	he	1109	' take it to the little ones . '
17665	19198	17659	17659	They	1190	' daughters , who were sadly displeased at first ; but took to them kindly after awhile , and made a new home in their babies . For women , as it seems to me , like strong men more than weak ones , feeling that they need some staunchness , something to hold fast by . And of all the men in our country , although we are of a thick - set breed , you scarce could find one in three - score fit to be placed among the Doones , without looking no more than a tailor . Like enough , we could meet them man for man if we chose all around the crown and the skirts of Exmoor , and show them what a cross - buttock means , because we are so stuggy ; but in regard of stature , comeliness , and bearing , no woman would look twice at us . Not but what I myself , John Ridd , and one or two I know of but it becomes me best not to talk of that , although my hair is gray . Perhaps their den might well have been stormed , and themselves driven out of the forest , if honest people had only agreed to begin with them at once when first they took to plundering . But having respect for their good birth , and pity for their misfortunes , and perhaps a little admiration at the justice of God , that robbed men now were robbers , the squires , and farmers , and shepherds , at first did nothing more than grumble gently , or even make a laugh of it , each in the case of others . After awhile they found the matter gone too far for laughter , as violence and deadly outrage stained the hand of robbery , until every woman clutched her child , and every man turned pale at the very name of Doone . For the sons and grandsons of Sir Ensor grew up in foul liberty , and haughtiness , and hatred , to utter scorn of God and man , and brutality towards dumb animals . There was only one good thing about them , if indeed it were good , to wit , their faith to one another , and truth to their wild eyry . But this only made them feared the more , so certain was the revenge they wreaked upon any who dared to strike a Doone . One night , some ten years ere I was born , when they were sacking a rich man 's house not very far from Minehead , a shot was fired at them in the dark , of which they took little notice , and only one of them knew that any harm was done . But when they were well on the homeward road , not having slain either man or woman , or even burned a house down , one of their number fell from his saddle , and died without so much as a groan . The youth had been struck , but would not complain , and perhaps took little heed of the wound , while he was bleeding inwardly . His brothers and cousins laid him softly on a bank of whortle - berries , and just rode back to the lonely hamlet where he had taken his death - wound . No man nor woman was left in the morning , nor house for any to dwell in , only a child with its reason gone . This vile deed was done , beyond all doubt . This affair made prudent people find more reason to let them alone than to meddle with them ; and now they had so entrenched themselves , and waxed so strong in number , that nothing less than a troop of soldiers could wisely enter their premises ; and even so it might turn out ill , as perchance we shall see by - and - by . For not to mention the strength of the place , which I shall describe in its proper order when I come to visit it , there was not one among them but was a mighty man , straight and tall , and wide , and fit to lift four hundredweight . If son or grandson of old Doone , or one of the northern retainers , failed at the age of twenty , while standing on his naked feet to touch with his forehead the lintel of Sir Ensor 's door , and to fill the door frame with his shoulders from sidepost even to sidepost , he was led away to the narrow pass which made their valley so desperate , and thrust from the crown with ignominy , to get his own living honestly . Now , the measure of that doorway is , or rather was , I ought to say , six feet and one inch lengthwise , and two feet all but two inches taken crossways in the clear . Yet I not only have heard but know , being so closely mixed with them , that no descendant of old Sir Ensor , neither relative of his except , indeed , the Counsellor , who was kept by them for his wisdom , and no more than two of their following ever failed of that test , and relapsed to the difficult ways of honesty . Not that I think anything great of a standard the like of that : for if they had set me in that door - frame at the age of twenty , it is like enough that I should have walked away with it on my shoulders , though I was not come to my full strength then : only I am speaking now of the average size of our neighbourhood , and the Doones were far beyond that . Moreover , they were taught to shoot with a heavy carbine so delicately and wisely , that even a boy could pass a ball through a rabbit 's head at the distance of fourscore yards . Some people may think nought of this , being in practice with longer shots from the tongue than from the shoulder ; nevertheless , to do as above is , to my ignorance , very good work , if you can be sure to do it . Not one word do I believe of Robin Hood splitting peeled wands at seven - score yards , and such like . Whoever wrote such stories knew not how slippery a peeled wand is , even if one could hit it , and how it gives to the onset . Now , let him stick one in the ground , and take his bow and arrow at it , ten yards away , or even five . Now , after all this which I have written , and all the rest which a reader will see , being quicker of mind than I am who leave more than half behind me , like a man sowing wheat , with his dinner laid in the ditch too near his dog , it is much but what you will understand the Doones far better than I did , or do even to this moment ; and therefore none will doubt when I tell them that our good justiciaries feared to make an ado , or hold any public inquiry about my dear father 's death . They would all have had to ride home that night , and who could say what might betide them . Least said soonest mended , because less chance of breaking . So we buried him quietly all except my mother , indeed , for she could not keep silence in the sloping little churchyard of Oare , as meek a place as need be , with the Lynn brook down below it . There is not much of company there for anybody 's tombstone , because the parish spreads so far in woods and moors without dwelling - house . If we bury one man in three years , or even a woman or child , we talk about it for three months , and say it must be our turn next , and scarcely grow accustomed to it until another goes . Annie was not allowed to come , because she cried so terribly ; but she ran to the window , and saw it all , mooing there like a little calf , so frightened and so left alone . As for Eliza , she came with me , one on each side of mother , and not a tear was in her eyes , but sudden starts of wonder , and a new thing to be looked at unwillingly , yet curiously . Poor little thing ! she was very clever , the only one of our family thank God for the same but none the more for that guessed she what it is to lose a father .

21364	21390	21391	21392	villainous saltpetre	1263	' But in spite of all assurances , he showed himself desirous only to see the last of my gun and me . I dare say '
21394	21846	21391	21392	villainous saltpetre	1263	' as the great playwright calls it , was never so cheap before nor since . For my shilling Master Pooke afforded me two great packages over - large to go into my pockets , as well as a mighty chunk of lead , which I bound upon Peggy 's withers . And as if all this had not been enough , he presented me with a roll of comfits for my sister Annie , whose gentle face and pretty manners won the love of everybody . There was still some daylight here and there as I rose the hill above Porlock , wondering whether my mother would be in a fright , or would not know it . The two great packages of powder , slung behind my back , knocked so hard against one another that I feared they must either spill or blow up , and hurry me over Peggy 's ears from the woollen cloth I rode upon . For father always liked a horse to have some wool upon his loins whenever he went far from home , and had to stand about , where one pleased , hot , and wet , and panting . And father always said that saddles were meant for men full - grown and heavy , and losing their activity ; and no boy or young man on our farm durst ever get into a saddle , because they all knew that the master would chuck them out pretty quickly . As for me , I had tried it once , from a kind of curiosity ; and I could not walk for two or three days , the leather galled my knees so . But now , as Peggy bore me bravely , snorting every now and then into a cloud of air , for the night was growing frosty , presently the moon arose over the shoulder of a hill , and the pony and I were half glad to see her , and half afraid of the shadows she threw , and the images all around us . I was ready at any moment to shoot at anybody , having great faith in my blunderbuss , but hoping not to prove it . And as I passed the narrow place where the Doones had killed my father , such a fear broke out upon me that I leaned upon the neck of Peggy , and shut my eyes , and was cold all over . However , there was not a soul to be seen , until we came home to the old farmyard , and there was my mother crying sadly , and Betty Muxworthy scolding . '
21852	21864	21391	21392	villainous saltpetre	1263	' I whispered to Annie , the moment supper was over ; '
21881	22080	21875	21875	I	0	' She lifted herself on the bench so quickly , and flushed so rich with pleasure , that I was obliged to stare hard away , and make Betty look beyond us . Betty thought I had something hid in the closet beyond the clock - case , and she was the more convinced of it by reason of my denial . Not that Betty Muxworthy , or any one else , for that matter , ever found me in a falsehood , because I never told one , not even to my mother or , which is still a stronger thing , not even to my sweetheart when I grew up to have one but that Betty being wronged in the matter of marriage , a generation or two agone , by a man who came hedging and ditching , had now no mercy , except to believe that men from cradle to grave are liars , and women fools to look at them . When Betty could find no crime of mine , she knocked me out of the way in a minute , as if I had been nobody ; and then she began to coax '
22084	22142	22081	22082	Mistress Annie	324	' as she always called her , and draw the soft hair down her hands , and whisper into the little ears . Meanwhile , dear mother was falling asleep , having been troubled so much about me ; and Watch , my father 's pet dog , was nodding closer and closer up into her lap . '

And again , which is not a bad proverb , though unthrifty and unlike a Scotsman 's , God makes the wheat grow greener , While farmer be at his dinner . And no Devonshire man , or Somerset either and I belong to both of them , ever thinks of working harder than God likes to see him . Nevertheless , I worked hard at the gun , and by the time that I had sent all the church - roof gutters , so far as I honestly could cut them , through the red pine - door , I began to long for a better tool that would make less noise and throw straighter . But the sheep - shearing came and the hay - season next , and then the harvest of small corn , and the digging of the root called '
33539	33555	33925	33925	Zailor	315	' a new but good thing in our neighbourhood , which our folk have made into '
33557	33924	33925	33925	Zailor	315	' , and then the sweating of the apples , and the turning of the cider - press , and the stacking of the firewood , and netting of the woodcocks , and the springles to be minded in the garden and by the hedgerows , where blackbirds hop to the molehills in the white October mornings , and grey birds come to look for snails at the time when the sun is rising . It is wonderful how time runs away , when all these things and a great many others come in to load him down the hill and prevent him from stopping to look about . And I for my part can never conceive how people who live in towns and cities , where neither lambs nor birds are except in some shop windows , nor growing corn , nor meadow - grass , nor even so much as a stick to cut or a stile to climb and sit down upon how these poor folk get through their lives without being utterly weary of them , and dying from pure indolence , is a thing God only knows , if His mercy allows Him to think of it . How the year went by I know not , only that I was abroad all day , shooting , or fishing , or minding the farm , or riding after some stray beast , or away by the seaside below Glenthorne , wondering at the great waters , and resolving to go for a sailor . For in those days I had a firm belief , as many other strong boys have , of being born for a seaman . And indeed I had been in a boat nearly twice ; but the second time mother found it out , and came and drew me back again ; and after that she cried so badly , that I was forced to give my word to her to go no more without telling her . But Betty Muxworthy spoke her mind quite in a different way about it , the while she was wringing my hosen , and clattering to the drying - horse . '

Already her fame was noised abroad , nearly as much as her master 's ; and my longing to ride her grew tenfold , but fear came at the back of it . Not that I had the smallest fear of what the mare could do to me , by fair play and horse - trickery , but that the glory of sitting upon her seemed to be too great for me ; especially as there were rumours abroad that she was not a mare after all , but a witch . However , she looked like a filly all over , and wonderfully beautiful , with her supple stride , and soft slope of shoulder , and glossy coat beaded with water , and prominent eyes full of docile fire . Whether this came from her Eastern blood of the Arabs newly imported , and whether the cream - colour , mixed with our bay , led to that bright strawberry tint , is certainly more than I can decide , being chiefly acquaint with farm - horses . And these come of any colour and form ; you never can count what they will be , and are lucky to get four legs to them . Mr. Faggus gave his mare a wink , and she walked demurely after him , a bright young thing , flowing over with life , yet dropping her soul to a higher one , and led by love to anything ; as the manner is of females , when they know what is the best for them . Then Winnie trod lightly upon the straw , because it had soft muck under it , and her delicate feet came back again . '
37544	37562	37542	37542	ye	940	' Tom Faggus stopped , and the mare stopped there ; and they looked at me provokingly . '
37584	37619	37625	37625	you	940	' Mr. Faggus laughed very quietly , turning round to Winnie so that she might enter into it . And she , for her part , seemed to know exactly where the fun lay . '

37663	37684	37659	37659	me	0	' said I , waxing wroth , for reasons I can not tell you , because they are too manifold ; '
37710	37864	37704	37704	she	940	' Then Mr. Faggus was up on his mettle , at this proud speech of mine ; and John Fry was running up all the while , and Bill Dadds , and half a dozen . Tom Faggus gave one glance around , and then dropped all regard for me . The high repute of his mare was at stake , and what was my life compared to it ? Through my defiance , and stupid ways , here was I in a duello , and my legs not come to their strength yet , and my arms as limp as a herring . Something of this occurred to him even in his wrath with me , for he spoke very softly to the filly , who now could scarce subdue herself ; but she drew in her nostrils , and breathed to his breath and did all she could to answer him . '
37872	37876	37878	37878	him	1676	' he said : '
37891	37954	37955	37955	Gee	327	' Then he turned the saddle off , and I was up in a moment . She began at first so easily , and pricked her ears so lovingly , and minced about as if pleased to find so light a weight upon her , that I thought she knew I could ride a little , and feared to show any capers . '
37960	37982	37983	37984	Gee wug	327	' cried I , for all the men were now looking on , being then at the leaving - off time : '
37996	38208	37983	37984	Gee wug	327	' With that I plugged my heels into her , and Billy Dadds flung his hat up . Nevertheless , she outraged not , though her eyes were frightening Annie , and John Fry took a pick to keep him safe ; but she curbed to and fro with her strong forearms rising like springs ingathered , waiting and quivering grievously , and beginning to sweat about it . Then her master gave a shrill clear whistle , when her ears were bent towards him , and I felt her form beneath me gathering up like whalebone , and her hind - legs coming under her , and I knew that I was in for it . First she reared upright in the air , and struck me full on the nose with her comb , till I bled worse than Robin Snell made me ; and then down with her fore - feet deep in the straw , and her hind - feet going to heaven . Finding me stick to her still like wax , for my mettle was up as hers was , away she flew with me swifter than ever I went before , or since , I trow . She drove full - head at the cobwall '
38216	38240	38211	38211	Jack	281	' screamed Annie then she turned like light , when I thought to crush her , and ground my left knee against it . '
38244	38260	38211	38211	Jack	281	' I cried , for my breeches were broken , and short words went the furthest '
38272	38686	38266	38266	you	1678	' Then she took the court - yard gate at a leap , knocking my words between my teeth , and then right over a quick set hedge , as if the sky were a breath to her ; and away for the water - meadows , while I lay on her neck like a child at the breast and wished I had never been born . Straight away , all in the front of the wind , and scattering clouds around her , all I knew of the speed we made was the frightful flash of her shoulders , and her mane like trees in a tempest . I felt the earth under us rushing away , and the air left far behind us , and my breath came and went , and I prayed to God , and was sorry to be so late of it . All the long swift while , without power of thought , I clung to her crest and shoulders , and dug my nails into her creases , and my toes into her flank - part , and was proud of holding on so long , though sure of being beaten . Then in her fury at feeling me still , she rushed at another device for it , and leaped the wide water - trough sideways across , to and fro , till no breath was left in me . The hazel - boughs took me too hard in the face , and the tall dog - briers got hold of me , and the ache of my back was like crimping a fish ; till I longed to give up , thoroughly beaten , and lie there and die in the cresses . But there came a shrill whistle from up the home - hill , where the people had hurried to watch us ; and the mare stopped as if with a bullet , then set off for home with the speed of a swallow , and going as smoothly and silently . I never had dreamed of such delicate motion , fluent , and graceful , and ambient , soft as the breeze flitting over the flowers , but swift as the summer lightning . I sat up again , but my strength was all spent , and no time left to recover it , and though she rose at our gate like a bird , I tumbled off into the mixen .
38693	38699	38700	38701	Mr. Faggus	272	' Well done , lad , '
38766	38801	38750	38751	John Fry	274	' Not at all bad work , my boy ; we may teach you to ride by - and - by , I see ; I thought not to see you stick on so long '

38826	38893	38750	38751	John Fry	274	' Boy , thou art right . She hath given many the slip . Ha , ha ! Vex not , Jack , that I laugh at thee . She is like a sweetheart to me , and better , than any of them be . It would have gone to my heart if thou hadst conquered . None but I can ride my Winnie mare . '

44060	46308	47091	47092	MASTER HUCKABACK	347	' Tis a melancholy story . He came again about three months afterwards , in the beginning of the spring - time , and brought me a beautiful new carbine , having learned my love of such things , and my great desire to shoot straight . But mother would not let me have the gun , until he averred upon his honour that he had bought it honestly . And so he had , no doubt , so far as it is honest to buy with money acquired rampantly . Scarce could I stop to make my bullets in the mould which came along with it , but must be off to the Quarry Hill , and new target I had made there . And he taught me then how to ride bright Winnie , who was grown since I had seen her , but remembered me most kindly . After making much of Annie , who had a wondrous liking for him and he said he was her godfather , but God knows how he could have been , unless they confirmed him precociously away he went , and young Winnie 's sides shone like a cherry by candlelight . Now I feel that of those boyish days I have little more to tell , because everything went quietly , as the world for the most part does with us . I began to work at the farm in earnest , and tried to help my mother , and when I remembered Lorna Doone , it seemed no more than the thought of a dream , which I could hardly call to mind . Now who cares to know how many bushels of wheat we grew to the acre , or how the cattle milched till we ate them , or what the turn of the seasons was ? But my stupid self seemed like to be the biggest of all the cattle ; for having much to look after the sheep , and being always in kind appetite , I grew four inches longer in every year of my farming , and a matter of two inches wider ; until there was no man of my size to be seen elsewhere upon Exmoor . Let that pass : what odds to any how tall or wide I be ? There is no Doone 's door at Plover 's Barrows and if there were I could never go through it . They vexed me so much about my size , long before I had completed it , girding at me with paltry jokes whose wit was good only to stay at home , that I grew shame - faced about the matter , and feared to encounter a looking - glass . But mother was very proud , and said she never could have too much of me . The worst of all to make me ashamed of bearing my head so high a thing I saw no way to help , for I never could hang my chin down , and my back was like a gatepost whenever I tried to bend it the worst of all was our little Eliza , who never could come to a size herself , though she had the wine from the Sacrament at Easter and Allhallowmas , only to be small and skinny , sharp , and clever crookedly . Not that her body was out of the straight being too small for that perhaps , but that her wit was full of corners , jagged , and strange , and uncomfortable . You never could tell what she might say next ; and I like not that kind of women . Now God forgive me for talking so of my own father 's daughter , and so much the more by reason that my father could not help it . The right way is to face the matter , and then be sorry for every one . My mother fell grievously on a slide , which John Fry had made nigh the apple - room door , and hidden with straw from the stable , to cover his own great idleness . My father laid John 's nose on the ice , and kept him warm in spite of it ; but it was too late for Eliza . She was born next day with more mind than body the worst thing that can befall a man . But Annie , my other sister , was now a fine fair girl , beautiful to behold . I could look at her by the fireside , for an hour together , when I was not too sleepy , and think of my dear father . And she would do the same thing by me , only wait the between of the blazes . Her hair was done up in a knot behind , but some would fall over her shoulders ; and the dancing of the light was sweet to see through a man 's eyelashes . There never was a face that showed the light or the shadow of feeling , as if the heart were sun to it , more than our dear Annie 's did . To look at her carefully , you might think that she was not dwelling on anything ; and then she would know you were looking at her , and those eyes would tell all about it . God knows that I try to be simple enough , to keep to His meaning in me , and not make the worst of His children . Yet often have I been put to shame , and ready to bite my tongue off , after speaking amiss of anybody , and letting out my littleness , when suddenly mine eyes have met the pure soft gaze of Annie . As for the Doones , they were thriving still , and no one to come against them ; except indeed by word of mouth , to which they lent no heed whatever . Complaints were made from time to time , both in high and low quarters as the rank might be of the people robbed , and once or twice in the highest of all , to wit , the King himself . But His Majesty made a good joke about it not meaning any harm , I doubt , and was so much pleased with himself thereupon , that he quite forgave the mischief . Moreover , the main authorities were a long way off ; and the Chancellor had no cattle on Exmoor ; and as for my lord the Chief Justice , some rogue had taken his silver spoons ; whereupon his lordship swore that never another man would he hang until he had that one by the neck . Therefore the Doones went on as they listed , and none saw fit to meddle with them . For the only man who would have dared to come to close quarters with them , that is to say Tom Faggus , himself was a quarry for the law , if ever it should be unhooded . Moreover , he had transferred his business to the neighbourhood of Wantage , in the county of Berks , where he found the climate drier , also good downs and commons excellent for galloping , and richer yeomen than ours be , and better roads to rob them on . Some folk , who had wiser attended to their own affairs , said that I being sizeable now , and able to shoot not badly ought to do something against those Doones , and show what I was made of . But for a time I was very bashful , shaking when called upon suddenly , and blushing as deep as a maiden ; for my strength was not come upon me , and mayhap I had grown in front of it . And again , though I loved my father still , and would fire at a word about him , I saw not how it would do him good for me to harm his injurers . Some races are of revengeful kind , and will for years pursue their wrong , and sacrifice this world and the next for a moment 's foul satisfaction , but methinks this comes of some black blood , perverted and never purified . And I doubt but men of true English birth are stouter than so to be twisted , though some of the women may take that turn , if their own life runs unkindly . Let that pass I am never good at talking of things beyond me . All I know is , that if I had met the Doone who had killed my father , I would gladly have thrashed him black and blue , supposing I were able ; but would never have fired a gun at him , unless he began that game with me , or fell upon more of my family , or were violent among women . And to do them justice , my mother and Annie were equally kind and gentle , but Eliza would flame and grow white with contempt , and not trust herself to speak to us . Now a strange thing came to pass that winter , when I was twenty - one years old , a very strange thing , which affrighted the rest , and made me feel uncomfortable . Not that there was anything in it , to do harm to any one , only that none could explain it , except by attributing it to the devil . The weather was very mild and open , and scarcely any snow fell ; at any rate , none lay on the ground , even for an hour , in the highest part of Exmoor ; a thing which I knew not before nor since , as long as I can remember . But the nights were wonderfully dark , as though with no stars in the heaven ; and all day long the mists were rolling upon the hills and down them , as if the whole land were a wash - house . The moorland was full of snipes and teal , and curlews flying and crying , and lapwings flapping heavily , and ravens hovering round dead sheep ; yet no redshanks nor dottrell , and scarce any golden plovers of which we have great store generally but vast lonely birds , that cried at night , and moved the whole air with their pinions ; yet no man ever saw them . It was dismal as well as dangerous now for any man to go fowling which of late I loved much in the winter because the fog would come down so thick that the pan of the gun was reeking , and the fowl out of sight ere the powder kindled , and then the sound of the piece was so dead , that the shooter feared harm , and glanced over his shoulder . But the danger of course was far less in this than in losing of the track , and falling into the mires , or over the brim of a precipice . Nevertheless , I must needs go out , being young and very stupid , and feared of being afraid ; a fear which a wise man has long cast by , having learned of the manifold dangers which ever and ever encompass us . And beside this folly and wildness of youth , perchance there was something , I know not what , of the joy we have in uncertainty . Mother , in fear of my missing home though for that matter , I could smell supper , when hungry , through a hundred land - yards of fog my dear mother , who thought of me ten times for one thought about herself , gave orders to ring the great sheep - bell , which hung above the pigeon - cote , every ten minutes of the day , and the sound came through the plaits of fog , and I was vexed about it , like the letters of a copy - book . It reminded me , too , of Blundell 's bell , and the grief to go into school again . But during those two months of fog for we had it all the winter , the saddest and the heaviest thing was to stand beside the sea . To be upon the beach yourself , and see the long waves coming in ; to know that they are long waves , but only see a piece of them ; and to hear them lifting roundly , swelling over smooth green rocks , plashing down in the hollow corners , but bearing on all the same as ever , soft and sleek and sorrowful , till their little noise is over . One old man who lived at Lynmouth , seeking to be buried there , having been more than half over the world , though shy to speak about it , and fain to come home to his birthplace , this old Will Watcombe who dwelt by the water said that our strange winter arose from a thing he called the '
46312	46690	47091	47092	MASTER HUCKABACK	347	' , rushing up Channel suddenly . He said it was hot water , almost fit for a man to shave with , and it threw all our cold water out , and ruined the fish and the spawning - time , and a cold spring would come after it . I was fond of going to Lynmouth on Sunday to hear this old man talk , for sometimes he would discourse with me , when nobody else could move him . He told me that this powerful flood set in upon our west so hard sometimes once in ten years , and sometimes not for fifty , and the Lord only knew the sense of it ; but that when it came , therewith came warmth and clouds , and fog , and moisture , and nuts , and fruit , and even shells ; and all the tides were thrown abroad . As for nuts he winked awhile , and chewed a piece of tobacco ; yet did I not comprehend him . Only afterwards I heard that nuts with liquid kernels came , travelling on the Gulf stream ; for never before was known so much foreign cordial landed upon our coast , floating ashore by mistake in the fog , and what with the tossing and the mist too much astray to learn its duty . Folk , who are ever too prone to talk , said that Will Watcombe himself knew better than anybody else about this drift of the Gulf - stream , and the places where it would come ashore , and the caves that took the in - draught . But De Whichehalse , our great magistrate , certified that there was no proof of unlawful importation ; neither good cause to suspect it , at a time of Christian charity . And we knew that it was a foul thing for some quarrymen to say that night after night they had been digging a new cellar at Ley Manor to hold the little marks of respect found in the caverns at high - water weed . Let that be , it is none of my business to speak evil of dignities ; duly we common people joked of the '
46695	47088	47091	47092	MASTER HUCKABACK	347	' as we called it . But the thing which astonished and frightened us so , was not , I do assure you , the landing of foreign spirits , nor the loom of a lugger at twilight in the gloom of the winter moonrise . That which made as crouch in by the fire , or draw the bed - clothes over us , and try to think of something else , was a strange mysterious sound . At grey of night , when the sun was gone , and no red in the west remained , neither were stars forthcoming , suddenly a wailing voice rose along the valleys , and a sound in the air , as of people running . It mattered not whether you stood on the moor , or crouched behind rocks away from it , or down among reedy places ; all as one the sound would come , now from the heart of the earth beneath , now overhead bearing down on you . And then there was rushing of something by , and melancholy laughter , and the hair of a man would stand on end before he could reason properly . God , in His mercy , knows that I am stupid enough for any man , and very slow of impression , nor ever could bring myself to believe that our Father would let the evil one get the upper hand of us . But when I had heard that sound three times , in the lonely gloom of the evening fog , and the cold that followed the lines of air , I was loath to go abroad by night , even so far as the stables , and loved the light of a candle more , and the glow of a fire with company . There were many stories about it , of course , all over the breadth of the moorland . But those who had heard it most often declared that it must be the wail of a woman 's voice , and the rustle of robes fleeing horribly , and fiends in the fog going after her . To that , however , I paid no heed , when anybody was with me ; only we drew more close together , and barred the doors at sunset .
47241	48118	48125	48125	Betty	277	' ay , and if it came to that , they would like to see any man , at Bampton , or at Wivelscombe , and you might say almost Taunton , who could put down golden Jacobus and Carolus against him . Now this old gentleman so they called him , according to his money ; and I have seen many worse ones , more violent and less wealthy he must needs come away that time to spend the New Year - tide with us ; not that he wanted to do it for he hated country - life , but because my mother pressing , as mothers will do to a good bag of gold , had wrung a promise from him ; and the only boast of his life was that never yet had he broken his word , at least since he opened business . Now it pleased God that Christmas - time in spite of all the fogs to send safe home to Dulverton , and what was more , with their loads quite safe , a goodly string of packhorses . Nearly half of their charge was for Uncle Reuben , and he knew how to make the most of it . Then having balanced his debits and credits , and set the writs running against defaulters , as behoves a good Christian at Christmas - tide , he saddled his horse , and rode off towards Oare , with a good stout coat upon him , and leaving Ruth and his head man plenty to do , and little to eat , until they should see him again . It had been settled between us that we should expect him soon after noon on the last day of December . For the Doones being lazy and fond of bed , as the manner is of dishonest folk , the surest way to escape them was to travel before they were up and about , to - wit , in the forenoon of the day . But herein we reckoned without our host : for being in high festivity , as became good Papists , the robbers were too lazy , it seems , to take the trouble of going to bed ; and forth they rode on the Old Year - morning , not with any view of business , but purely in search of mischief . We had put off our dinner till one o'clock which to me was a sad foregoing , and there was to be a brave supper at six of the clock , upon New Year's - eve ; and the singers to come with their lanthorns , and do it outside the parlour - window , and then have hot cup till their heads should go round , after making away with the victuals . For although there was nobody now in our family to be churchwarden of Oare , it was well admitted that we were the people entitled alone to that dignity ; and though Nicholas Snowe was in office by name , he managed it only by mother 's advice ; and a pretty mess he made of it , so that every one longed for a Ridd again , soon as ever I should be old enough . This Nicholas Snowe was to come in the evening , with his three tall comely daughters , strapping girls , and well skilled in the dairy ; and the story was all over the parish , on a stupid conceit of John Fry 's , that I should have been in love with all three , if there had been but one of them . These Snowes were to come , and come they did , partly because Mr. Huckaback liked to see fine young maidens , and partly because none but Nicholas Snowe could smoke a pipe now all around our parts , except of the very high people , whom we durst never invite . And Uncle Ben , as we all knew well , was a great hand at his pipe , and would sit for hours over it , in our warm chimney - corner , and never want to say a word , unless it were inside him ; only he liked to have somebody there over against him smoking . Now when I came in , before one o'clock , after seeing to the cattle for the day was thicker than ever , and we must keep the cattle close at home , if we wished to see any more of them I fully expected to find Uncle Ben sitting in the fireplace , lifting one cover and then another , as his favourite manner was , and making sweet mouths over them ; for he loved our bacon rarely , and they had no good leeks at Dulverton ; and he was a man who always would see his business done himself . But there instead of my finding him with his quaint dry face pulled out at me , and then shut up sharp not to be cheated who should run out but Betty Muxworthy , and poke me with a saucepan lid . '
48127	48170	48125	48125	Betty	277	' I said in my politest manner , for really Betty was now become a great domestic evil . She would have her own way so , and of all things the most distressful was for a man to try to reason . '
48175	48203	48125	48125	Betty	277	' cried Betty again , for she thought it a fine joke to call me that , because of my size , and my hatred of it ; '
48213	48214	48223	48223	Betty	277	' '
48235	48253	48228	48228	I	0	' With that I wanted to go and smell it , and not to stop for Betty . '

48337	48415	48320	48320	I	0	' And Betty , who hated Uncle Ben , because he never gave her a groat , and she was not allowed to dine with him , I am sorry to say that Betty Muxworthy grinned all across , and poked me again with the greasy saucepan cover . But I misliking so to be treated , strode through the kitchen indignantly , for Betty behaved to me even now , as if I were only Eliza . '
48422	48457	48420	48420	Johnny	279	' my mother cried , running out of the grand show - parlour , where the case of stuffed birds was , and peacock - feathers , and the white hare killed by grandfather ; '
48476	48628	48629	48629	Johnny	279	' Mother had upon her wrists something very wonderful , of the nature of fal - lal as we say , and for which she had an inborn turn , being of good draper family , and polished above the yeomanry . Nevertheless I could never bear it , partly because I felt it to be out of place in our good farm - house , partly because I hate frippery , partly because it seemed to me to have nothing to do with father , and partly because I never could tell the reason of my hating it . And yet the poor soul had put them on , not to show her hands off which were above her station but simply for her children 's sake , because Uncle Ben had given them . But another thing , I never could bear for man or woman to call me , '

49001	49009	49011	49011	you	1006	' for she looked very grave about it '

49056	49593	49051	49052	Uncle Ben	295	' So we made a very good dinner indeed , though wishing that he could have some of it , and wondering how much to leave for him ; and then , as no sound of his horse had been heard , I set out with my gun to look for him . I followed the track on the side of the hill , from the farm - yard , where the sledd - marks are for we have no wheels upon Exmoor yet , nor ever shall , I suppose ; though a dunder - headed man tried it last winter , and broke his axle piteously , and was nigh to break his neck and after that I went all along on the ridge of the rabbit - cleve , with the brook running thin in the bottom ; and then down to the Lynn stream and leaped it , and so up the hill and the moor beyond . The fog hung close all around me then , when I turned the crest of the highland , and the gorse both before and behind me looked like a man crouching down in ambush . But still there was a good cloud of daylight , being scarce three of the clock yet , and when a lead of red deer came across , I could tell them from sheep even now . I was half inclined to shoot at them , for the children did love venison ; but they drooped their heads so , and looked so faithful , that it seemed hard measure to do it . If one of them had bolted away , no doubt I had let go at him . After that I kept on the track , trudging very stoutly , for nigh upon three miles , and my beard now beginning to grow at some length was full of great drops and prickly , whereat I was very proud . I had not so much as a dog with me , and the place was unkind and lonesome , and the rolling clouds very desolate ; and now if a wild sheep ran across he was scared at me as an enemy ; and I for my part could not tell the meaning of the marks on him . We called all this part Gibbet - moor , not being in our parish ; but though there were gibbets enough upon it , most part of the bodies was gone for the value of the chains , they said , and the teaching of young chirurgeons . But of all this I had little fear , being no more a schoolboy now , but a youth well - acquaint with Exmoor , and the wise art of the sign - posts , whereby a man , who barred the road , now opens it up both ways with his finger - bones , so far as rogues allow him . My carbine was loaded and freshly primed , and I knew myself to be even now a match in strength for any two men of the size around our neighbourhood , except in the Glen Doone . '
49598	50029	50030	50030	God	268	' I was called already , and folk grew feared to wrestle with me ; though I was tired of hearing about it , and often longed to be smaller . And most of all upon Sundays , when I had to make way up our little church , and the maidens tittered at me . The soft white mist came thicker around me , as the evening fell ; and the peat ricks here and there , and the furze - hucks of the summer - time , were all out of shape in the twist of it . By - and - by , I began to doubt where I was , or how come there , not having seen a gibbet lately ; and then I heard the draught of the wind up a hollow place with rocks to it ; and for the first time fear broke out like cold sweat upon me . And yet I knew what a fool I was , to fear nothing but a sound ! But when I stopped to listen , there was no sound , more than a beating noise , and that was all inside me . Therefore I went on again , making company of myself , and keeping my gun quite ready . Now when I came to an unknown place , where a stone was set up endwise , with a faint red cross upon it , and a polish from some conflict , I gathered my courage to stop and think , having sped on the way too hotly . Against that stone I set my gun , trying my spirit to leave it so , but keeping with half a hand for it ; and then what to do next was the wonder . As for finding Uncle Ben that was his own business , or at any rate his executor 's ; first I had to find myself , and plentifully would thank God to find myself at home again , for the sake of all our family . The volumes of the mist came rolling at me like great logs of wood , pillowed out with sleepiness , and between them there was nothing more than waiting for the next one . Then everything went out of sight , and glad was I of the stone behind me , and view of mine own shoes . Then a distant noise went by me , as of many horses galloping , and in my fright I set my gun and said , '
50037	50062	50030	50030	God	268	' Yet nothing came , and my gun fell back , without my will to lower it . But presently , while I was thinking '
50069	50365	50366	50366	Lord	1869	' arose as if from below my feet , so that the great stone trembled , that long , lamenting lonesome sound , as of an evil spirit not knowing what to do with it . For the moment I stood like a root , without either hand or foot to help me , and the hair of my head began to crawl , lifting my hat , as a snail lifts his house ; and my heart like a shuttle went to and fro . But finding no harm to come of it , neither visible form approaching , I wiped my forehead , and hoped for the best , and resolved to run every step of the way , till I drew our own latch behind me . Yet here again I was disappointed , for no sooner was I come to the cross - ways by the black pool in the hole , but I heard through the patter of my own feet a rough low sound very close in the fog , as of a hobbled sheep a - coughing . I listened , and feared , and yet listened again , though I wanted not to hear it . For being in haste of the homeward road , and all my heart having heels to it , loath I was to stop in the dusk for the sake of an aged wether . Yet partly my love of all animals , and partly my fear of the farmer 's disgrace , compelled me to go to the succour , and the noise was coming nearer . A dry short wheezing sound it was , barred with coughs and want of breath ; but thus I made the meaning of it . '
50415	50583	50410	50410	I	0	' These words , with many jogs between them , came to me through the darkness , and then a long groan and a choking . I made towards the sound , as nigh as ever I could guess , and presently was met , point - blank , by the head of a mountain - pony . Upon its back lay a man bound down , with his feet on the neck and his head to the tail , and his arms falling down like stirrups . The wild little nag was scared of its life by the unaccustomed burden , and had been tossing and rolling hard , in desire to get ease of it . Before the little horse could turn , I caught him , jaded as he was , by his wet and grizzled forelock , and he saw that it was vain to struggle , but strove to bite me none the less , until I smote him upon the nose . '
50589	50601	50584	50587	Good and worthy sir	1872	' I said to the man who was riding so roughly ; '
50612	50613	50620	50620	thou	1874	' '
50623	50641	50620	50620	thou	1874	' he gasped , but could not look at me , because his neck was jerked so ; '
50659	50660	50663	50664	Uncle Ben	295	' '
50666	50683	50663	50664	Uncle Ben	295	' I cried , letting go the horse in amazement , that the richest man in Dulverton '
50697	50698	50699	50703	An honest hosier and draper	1875	' '
50709	50716	50705	50708	serge and longcloth warehouseman	1876	' he groaned from rib to rib '
50787	50788	50791	50792	Uncle Ben	295	' '
50806	51043	51044	51044	He	1883	' Not to make a long story of it , I cut the thongs that bound him , and set him astride on the little horse ; but he was too weak to stay so . Therefore I mounted him on my back , turning the horse into horse - steps , and leading the pony by the cords which I fastened around his nose , set out for Plover 's Barrows . Uncle Ben went fast asleep on my back , being jaded and shaken beyond his strength , for a man of three - score and five ; and as soon he felt assured of safety he would talk no more . And to tell the truth he snored so loudly , that I could almost believe that fearful noise in the fog every night came all the way from Dulverton . Now as soon as ever I brought him in , we set him up in the chimney - corner , comfortable and handsome ; and it was no little delight to me to get him off my back ; for , like his own fortune , Uncle Ben was of a good round figure . He gave his long coat a shake or two , and he stamped about in the kitchen , until he was sure of his whereabouts , and then he fell asleep again until supper should be ready . '
51049	51065	51044	51044	He	1883	' he said by - and - by to himself , and not to me ; '
51110	51202	51107	51108	rascal robbers	1886	' My mother made a dreadful stir , of course , about Uncle Ben being in such a plight as this ; so I left him to her care and Annie 's , and soon they fed him rarely , while I went out to see to the comfort of the captured pony . And in truth he was worth the catching , and served us very well afterwards , though Uncle Ben was inclined to claim him for his business at Dulverton , where they have carts and that like . '
51205	51209	51210	51210	you	1887	' I said , '
51235	51530	51210	51210	you	1887	' And with that he dropped it . A very strange old man he was , short in his manner , though long of body , glad to do the contrary things to what any one expected of him , and always looking sharp at people , as if he feared to be cheated . This surprised me much at first , because it showed his ignorance of what we farmers are an upright race , as you may find , scarcely ever cheating indeed , except upon market - day , and even then no more than may be helped by reason of buyers expecting it . Now our simple ways were a puzzle to him , as I told him very often ; but he only laughed , and rubbed his mouth with the back of his dry shining hand , and I think he shortly began to languish for want of some one to higgle with . I had a great mind to give him the pony , because he thought himself cheated in that case ; only he would conclude that I did it with some view to a legacy . Of course , the Doones , and nobody else , had robbed good Uncle Reuben ; and then they grew sportive , and took his horse , an especially sober nag , and bound the master upon the wild one , for a little change as they told him . For two or three hours they had fine enjoyment chasing him through the fog , and making much sport of his groanings ; and then waxing hungry , they went their way , and left him to opportunity . Now Mr. Huckaback growing able to walk in a few days '
51553	51560	51561	51561	he	1891	' I have never deserved it , '
51580	51604	51561	51561	he	1891	' I have never deserved it , and will not stand it in the name of our lord the King , not I ! '
51614	51656	51608	51608	he	1891	' Three - score years and five have I lived an honest and laborious life , yet never was I robbed before . And now to be robbed in my old age , to be robbed for the first time now ! '
51848	51870	51841	51842	little Eliza	277	' You can give us the pretty things , Uncle Ben , when we come in the summer to see you . '
51911	51972	51895	51895	she	1006	' And if the young maidens would kindly come , without taking thought to smoothe themselves , why it would be all the merrier , and who knew but what Uncle Huckaback might bless the day of his robbery , etc . , etc . and thorough good honest girls they were , fit helpmates either for shop or farm . '
52225	52234	52236	52236	mother	1006	' Master Snowe , you are well assured , '
52251	52318	52236	52236	mother	1006	' that our kinsman here hath received rough harm on his peaceful journey from Dulverton . The times are bad , as we all know well , and there is no sign of bettering them , and if I could see our Lord the King I might say things to move him ! nevertheless , I have had so much of my own account to vex for '
52319	52330	52332	52333	Uncle Ben	295	' You are flying out of the subject , Sarah , '

But Uncle Ben took it in a different way . He thought that we all were afraid of him , and that Oare parish was but as Moab or Edom , for him to cast his shoe over . '
52626	52646	52623	52624	Nephew Jack	279	' he cried , looking at me when I was thinking what to say , and finding only emptiness , '

52961	53035	53036	53037	Maister Huckaback	362	' Here mother fetched out her handkerchief , being overcome by our goodness ; and I told her , with my hand to my mouth , not to notice him ; though he might be worth ten thousand times ten thousand pounds . But Farmer Snowe came forward now , for he had some sense sometimes ; and he thought it was high time for him to say a word for the parish . '
53039	53060	53036	53037	Maister Huckaback	362	' he began , pointing with his pipe at him , the end that was done in sealing - wax , '

53105	53317	53102	53103	a laiar	1949	' Then Farmer Nicholas Snowe folded his arms across with the bowl of his pipe on the upper one , and gave me a nod , and then one to mother , to testify how he had done his duty , and recked not what might come of it . However , he got little thanks from us ; for the parish was nothing at all to my mother , compared with her children 's interests ; and I thought it hard that an uncle of mine , and an old man too , should be called a liar , by a visitor at our fireplace . For we , in our rude part of the world , counted it one of the worst disgraces that could befall a man , to receive the lie from any one . But Uncle Ben , as it seems was used to it , in the way of trade , just as people of fashion are , by a style of courtesy . Therefore the old man only looked with pity at Farmer Nicholas ; and with a sort of sorrow too , reflecting how much he might have made in a bargain with such a customer , so ignorant and hot - headed . '

And you , Master Snowe , the very man whom I looked to to raise the country , and take the lead as churchwarden why , my youngest shopman would match his ell against you . Pack of cowards , '
53556	53579	53545	53546	Uncle Ben	295	' do n't pretend to answer me . Shake you all off , that I do nothing more to do with you ! '

53788	53910	53786	53786	he	347	' until I have said what I want to say ; for saving of ill - will among us ; and growth of cheer and comfort . May be I have carried things too far , even to the bounds of churlishness , and beyond the bounds of good manners . I will not unsay one word I have said , having never yet done so in my life ; but I would alter the manner of it , and set it forth in this light . If you folks upon Exmoor here are loath and wary at fighting , yet you are brave at better stuff ; the best and kindest I ever knew , in the matter of feeding . '
54550	54553	54555	54556	Uncle Ben	295	' Sir , '
54562	54608	54555	54556	Uncle Ben	295	' my health would fare much better , if you would pay me three pounds and twelve shillings , which you have owed me these five years back ; and now we are met at the Justice 's , the opportunity is good , sir . '

55212	55247	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' My lord , I am not their godfather ; and most like they never had any . But we all know old Sir Ensor 's name , so that may be no obstacle . '
55248	55275	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' Sir Ensor Doone and his sons so be it . How many sons , Master Huckaback , and what is the name of each one ? '
55276	55316	55178	55178	he	1993	' How can I tell you , my lord , even if I had known them all as well as my own shop - boys ? Nevertheless there were seven of them , and that should be no obstacle . '
55317	55374	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' A warrant against Sir Ensor Doone , and seven sons of Sir Ensor Doone , Christian names unknown , and doubted if they have any . So far so good Master Huckaback . I have it all down in writing . Sir Ensor himself was there , of course , as you have given in evidence '
55375	55391	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' No , no , my lord , I never said that : I never said '
55392	55444	55178	55178	he	1993	' If he can prove that he was not there , you may be indicted for perjury . But as for those seven sons of his , of course you can swear that they were his sons and not his nephews , or grandchildren , or even no Doones at all ? '
55445	55474	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' My lord , I can swear that they were Doones . Moreover , I can pay for any mistake I make . Therein need be no obstacle . '
55475	55490	55492	55493	Colonel Harding	368	' Oh , yes , he can pay ; he can pay well enough , '
55496	55505	55507	55508	the Baron	1993	' I am heartily glad to hear it , '
55511	55595	55507	55508	the Baron	1993	' for it proves after all that this robbery if robbery there has been was not so very ruinous . Sometimes people think they are robbed , and then it is very sweet afterwards to find that they have not been so ; for it adds to their joy in their property . Now , are you quite convinced , good sir , that these people if there were any stole , or took , or even borrowed anything at all from you ? '
55596	55608	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' My lord , do you think that I was drunk ? '
55609	55646	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' Not for a moment , Master Huckaback . Although excuse might be made for you at this time of the year . But how did you know that your visitors were of this particular family ? '
55647	55662	55156	55157	De Whichehalse	346	' Because it could be nobody else . Because , in spite of the fog '
55663	55666	55668	55669	Colonel Harding	368	' Fog ! '
55672	55675	55677	55678	the Baron	1993	' Fog ! '
55683	55771	55677	55678	the Baron	1993	' Ah , that explains the whole affair . To be sure , now I remember , the weather has been too thick for a man to see the head of his own horse . The Doones if still there be any Doones could never have come abroad ; that is as sure as simony . Master Huckaback , for your good sake , I am heartily glad that this charge has miscarried . I thoroughly understand it now . The fog explains the whole of it . '
55772	55780	55782	55783	Colonel Harding	368	' Go back , my good fellow , '
55785	55824	55782	55783	Colonel Harding	368	' and if the day is clear enough , you will find all your things where you left them . I know , from my own experience , what it is to be caught in an Exmoor fog . '
55846	55903	55838	55838	he	351	' My lord , Sir Colonel , is this your justice ! If I go to London myself for it , the King shall know how his commission how a man may be robbed , and the justices prove that he ought to be hanged at back of it ; that in his good shire of Somerset '
55904	55913	55914	55915	De Whichehalse	346	' Your pardon a moment , good sir , '
55919	55999	55914	55915	De Whichehalse	346	' but I was about having heard your case to mention what need be an obstacle , and , I fear , would prove a fatal one , even if satisfactory proof were afforded of a felony . The mal - feasance if any was laid in Somerset ; but we , two humble servants of His Majesty , are in commission of his peace for the county of Devon only , and therefore could never deal with it . '
56000	56010	56012	56013	Uncle Reuben	351	' And why , in the name of God , '
56022	56153	56020	56020	himself	351	' why could you not say as much at first , and save me all this waste of time and worry of my temper ? Gentlemen , you are all in league ; all of you stick together . You think it fair sport for an honest trader , who makes no shams as you do , to be robbed and wellnigh murdered , so long as they who did it won the high birthright of felony . If a poor sheep stealer , to save his children from dying of starvation , had dared to look at a two - month lamb , he would swing on the Manor gallows , and all of you cry " Good riddance ! " But now , because good birth and bad manners '

56269	56350	56250	56250	her	1006	' John , you may take my word for it , you have not done as you should have done . Your father would have been shocked to think of going to Baron de Whichehalse , and in his own house insulting him ! And yet it was very brave of you John . Just like you , all over . And as none of the men are here , dear John I am proud of you for doing it . '
56392	56447	56386	56386	he	295	' Nephew Jack , you have not behaved so badly as the rest to me . And because you have no gift of talking , I think that I may trust you . Now , mark my words , this villain job shall not have ending here . I have another card to play . '
56448	56477	56386	56386	he	295	' You mean , sir , I suppose , that you will go to the justices of this shire , Squire Maunder , or Sir Richard Blewitt , or '
56478	56558	56576	56576	he	2030	' Oaf , I mean nothing of the sort ; they would only make a laughing - stock , as those Devonshire people did , of me . No , I will go to the King himself , or a man who is bigger than the King , and to whom I have ready access . I will not tell thee his name at present , only if thou art brought before him , never wilt thou forget it . '
56582	56594	56579	56580	Judge Jeffreys	375	' And when are you likely to see him , sir ? '
56595	56700	56783	56783	he	351	' Maybe in the spring , maybe not until summer , for I can not go to London on purpose , but when my business takes me there . Only remember my words , Jack , and when you see the man I mean , look straight at him , and tell no lie . He will make some of your zany squires shake in their shoes , I reckon . Now , I have been in this lonely hole far longer than I intended , by reason of this outrage ; yet I will stay here one day more upon a certain condition . '
56701	56731	56576	56576	he	2030	' Upon what condition , Uncle Ben ? I grieve that you find it so lonely . We will have Farmer Nicholas up again , and the singers , and '
56732	56772	56579	56580	Judge Jeffreys	375	' The fashionable milkmaids . I thank you , let me be . The wenches are too loud for me . Your Nanny is enough . Nanny is a good child , and she shall come and visit me . '
56779	56781	56778	56778	her	2031	' Nanny '
56786	56788	56783	56783	he	351	' Annie '
56797	56867	56783	56783	he	351	' But my condition is this , Jack that you shall guide me to - morrow , without a word to any one , to a place where I may well descry the dwelling of these scoundrel Doones , and learn the best way to get at them , when the time shall come . Can you do this for me ? I will pay you well , boy . '
57255	57281	57249	57249	I	0	' Uncle Reuben , have no fear . I know every inch of the ground , sir ; and there is no danger nigh us . '
57282	57293	57249	57249	I	0	' Fear , boy ! Who ever thought of fear ? '
57308	58303	57305	57306	those primroses	2052	' At once I thought of Lorna Doone , the little maid of six years back , and how my fancy went with her . Could Lorna ever think of me ? Was I not a lout gone by , only fit for loach - sticking ? Had I ever seen a face fit to think of near her ? The sudden flash , the quickness , the bright desire to know one 's heart , and not withhold her own from it , the soft withdrawal of rich eyes , the longing to love somebody , anybody , anything , not imbrued with wickedness My uncle interrupted me , misliking so much silence now , with the naked woods falling over us . For we were come to Bagworthy forest , the blackest and the loneliest place of all that keep the sun out . Even now , in winter - time , with most of the wood unriddled , and the rest of it pinched brown , it hung around us like a cloak containing little comfort . I kept quite close to Peggy 's head , and Peggy kept quite close to me , and pricked her ears at everything . However , we saw nothing there , except a few old owls and hawks , and a magpie sitting all alone , until we came to the bank of the hill , where the pony could not climb it . Uncle Ben was very loath to get off , because the pony seemed company , and he thought he could gallop away on her , if the worst came to the worst , but I persuaded him that now he must go to the end of it . Therefore he made Peggy fast , in a place where we could find her , and speaking cheerfully as if there was nothing to be afraid of , he took his staff , and I my gun , to climb the thick ascent . There was now no path of any kind ; which added to our courage all it lessened of our comfort , because it proved that the robbers were not in the habit of passing there . And we knew that we could not go astray , so long as we breasted the hill before us ; inasmuch as it formed the rampart , or side - fence of Glen Doone . But in truth I used the right word there for the manner of our ascent , for the ground came forth so steep against us , and withal so woody , that to make any way we must throw ourselves forward , and labour as at a breast - plough . Rough and loamy rungs of oak - root bulged here and there above our heads ; briers needs must speak with us , using more of tooth than tongue ; and sometimes bulks of rugged stone , like great sheep , stood across us . At last , though very loath to do it , I was forced to leave my gun behind , because I required one hand to drag myself up the difficulty , and one to help Uncle Reuben . And so at last we gained the top , and looked forth the edge of the forest , where the ground was very stony and like the crest of a quarry ; and no more trees between us and the brink of cliff below , three hundred yards below it might be , all strong slope and gliddery . And now for the first time I was amazed at the appearance of the Doones 's stronghold , and understood its nature . For when I had been even in the valley , and climbed the cliffs to escape from it , about seven years agone , I was no more than a stripling boy , noting little , as boys do , except for their present purpose , and even that soon done with . But now , what with the fame of the Doones , and my own recollections , and Uncle Ben 's insistence , all my attention was called forth , and the end was simple astonishment . The chine of highland , whereon we stood , curved to the right and left of us , keeping about the same elevation , and crowned with trees and brushwood . At about half a mile in front of us , but looking as if we could throw a stone to strike any man upon it , another crest just like our own bowed around to meet it ; but failed by reason of two narrow clefts of which we could only see the brink . One of these clefts was the Doone - gate , with a portcullis of rock above it , and the other was the chasm by which I had once made entrance . Betwixt them , where the hills fell back , as in a perfect oval , traversed by the winding water , lay a bright green valley , rimmed with sheer black rock , and seeming to have sunken bodily from the bleak rough heights above . It looked as if no frost could enter neither wind go ruffling ; only spring , and hope , and comfort , breathe to one another . Even now the rays of sunshine dwelt and fell back on one another , whenever the clouds lifted ; and the pale blue glimpse of the growing day seemed to find young encouragement . But for all that , Uncle Reuben was none the worse nor better . He looked down into Glen Doone first , and sniffed as if he were smelling it , like a sample of goods from a wholesale house ; and then he looked at the hills over yonder , and then he stared at me .

For I had long ago descried that little opening in the cliff through which I made my exit , as before related , on the other side of the valley . No bigger than a rabbit - hole it seemed from where we stood ; and yet of all the scene before me , that from my remembrance perhaps had the most attraction . Now gazing at it with full thought of all that it had cost me , I saw a little figure come , and pause , and pass into it . Something very light and white , nimble , smooth , and elegant , gone almost before I knew that any one had been there . And yet my heart came to my ribs , and all my blood was in my face , and pride within me fought with shame , and vanity with self - contempt ; for though seven years were gone , and I from my boyhood come to manhood , and all must have forgotten me , and I had half - forgotten ; at that moment , once for all , I felt that I was face to face with fate however poor it might be , weal or woe , in Lorna Doone .
60006	60446	59999	59999	thou	2109	' Twill be my endeavour To be dear to thee . So shall I have plea , love , Is thy heart andbreath Clinging still to thee , love , In the doom of death . All this I took in with great eagerness , not for the sake of the meaning which is no doubt an allegory , but for the power and richness , and softness of the singing , which seemed to me better than we ever had even in Oare church . But all the time I kept myself in a black niche of the rock , where the fall of the water began , lest the sweet singer espying me should be alarmed , and flee away . But presently I ventured to look forth where a bush was ; and then I beheld the loveliest sight one glimpse of which was enough to make me kneel in the coldest water . By the side of the stream she was coming to me , even among the primroses , as if she loved them all ; and every flower looked the brighter , as her eyes were on them , I could not see what her face was , my heart so awoke and trembled ; only that her hair was flowing from a wreath of white violets , and the grace of her coming was like the appearance of the first wind - flower . The pale gleam over the western cliffs threw a shadow of light behind her , as if the sun were lingering . Never do I see that light from the closing of the west , even in these my aged days , without thinking of her . Ah me , if it comes to that , what do I see of earth or heaven , without thinking of her ? The tremulous thrill of her song was hanging on her open lips ; and she glanced around , as if the birds were accustomed to make answer . To me it was a thing of terror to behold such beauty , and feel myself the while to be so very low and common . But scarcely knowing what I did , as if a rope were drawing me , I came from the dark mouth of the chasm ; and stood , afraid to look at her . She was turning to fly , not knowing me , and frightened , perhaps , at my stature , when I fell on the grass as I fell before her seven years agone that day , and I just said , '
60450	60498	60447	60448	Lorna Doone	311	' She knew me at once , from my manner and ways , and a smile broke through her trembling , as sunshine comes through aspen - leaves ; and being so clever , she saw , of course , that she needed not to fear me . '
60503	60528	60447	60448	Lorna Doone	311	' she cried , with a feint of anger because she had shown her cowardice , and yet in her heart she was laughing ; '

60696	60819	60820	60820	I	0	' For she had kept her eyes upon me ; large eyes of a softness , a brightness , and a dignity which made me feel as if I must for ever love and yet for ever know myself unworthy . Unless themselves should fill with love , which is the spring of all things . And so I could not answer her , but was overcome with thinking and feeling and confusion . Neither could I look again ; only waited for the melody which made every word like a poem to me , the melody of her voice . But she had not the least idea of what was going on with me , any more than I myself had . '

60920	61100	60879	60879	I	0	' And more than that , she was trembling from real fear of violence , lest strong hands might be laid on me , and a miserable end of it . And to tell the truth , I grew afraid ; perhaps from a kind of sympathy , and because I knew that evil comes more readily than good to us . Therefore , without more ado , or taking any advantage although I would have been glad at heart , if needs had been , to kiss her without any thought of rudeness it struck me that I had better go , and have no more to say to her until next time of coming . So would she look the more for me and think the more about me , and not grow weary of my words and the want of change there is in me . For , of course , I knew what a churl I was compared to her birth and appearance ; but meanwhile I might improve myself and learn a musical instrument . '

But only to myself I cried for anything at all , having enough of man in me to be bashful with young maidens . So I touched her white hand softly when she gave it to me , and fancying that she had sighed was touched at heart about it , and resolved to yield her all my goods , although my mother was living ; and then grew angry with myself for a mile or more of walking to think she would condescend so ; and then , for the rest of the homeward road , was mad with every man in the world who would dare to think of having her .

In vain she strove , from year to year , to make the young men hearken , to teach them what became their birth , and give them sense of honour . It was her favourite word , poor thing ! and they called her " Old Aunt Honour . " Very often she used to say that I was her only comfort , and I am sure she was my only one ; and when she died it was more to me than if I had lost a mother . '

The grass moreover is so fresh , and the brook so bright and lively , and flowers of so many hues come after one another that no one need be dull , if only left alone with them . '

71503	71563	71564	71565	Master Ridd	261	' Here Lorna broke down for awhile , and cried so very piteously , that doubting of my knowledge , and of any power to comfort , I did my best to hold my peace , and tried to look very cheerful .

Sometimes I am so full of anger , that I dare not trust to speech , at things they can not hide from me ; and perhaps you would be much surprised that reckless men would care so much to elude a young girl 's knowledge . They used to boast to Aunt Sabina of pillage and of cruelty , on purpose to enrage her ; but they never boast to me . It even makes me smile sometimes to see how awkwardly they come and offer for temptation to me shining packets , half concealed , of ornaments and finery , of rings , or chains , or jewels , lately belonging to other people .

71888	72064	71862	71863	the Counsellor	1087	' But I am talking now of things which never come across me when any work is toward . It might have been a good thing for me to have had a father to beat these rovings out of me ; or a mother to make a home , and teach me how to manage it . For , being left with none I think ; and nothing ever comes of it . Nothing , I mean , which I can grasp and have with any surety ; nothing but faint images , and wonderment , and wandering . But often , when I am neither searching back into remembrance , nor asking of my parents , but occupied by trifles , something like a sign , or message , or a token of some meaning , seems to glance upon me . Whether from the rustling wind , or sound of distant music , or the singing of a bird , like the sun on snow it strikes me with a pain of pleasure . '
72209	72315	72316	72316	We	2402	' Often too I wonder at the odds of fortune , which made me helpless as I am , and fond of peace and reading the heiress of this mad domain , the sanctuary of unholiness . It is not likely that I shall have much power of authority ; and yet the Counsellor creeps up to be my Lord of the Treasury ; and his son aspires to my hand , as of a Royal alliance . Well , " honour among thieves , " they say ; and mine is the first honour : although among decent folk perhaps , honesty is better . '
72399	72497	72397	72397	Carver	260	' By your face , Master Ridd , I see that you have heard of Carver Doone . For strength and courage and resource he bears the first repute among us , as might well be expected from the son of the Counsellor . But he differs from his father , in being very hot and savage , and quite free from argument . The Counsellor , who is my uncle , gives his son the best advice ; commending all the virtues , with eloquence and wisdom ; yet himself abstaining from them accurately and impartially . '
72614	72944	72946	72946	Gwenny	393	' A little Cornish girl she is , and shaped in western manner , not so very much less in width than if you take her lengthwise . Her father seems to have been a miner , a Cornishman as she declares of more than average excellence , and better than any two men to be found in Devonshire , or any four in Somerset . Very few things can have been beyond his power of performance , and yet he left his daughter to starve upon a peat - rick . She does not know how this was done , and looks upon it as a mystery , the meaning of which will some day be clear , and redound to her father 's honour . His name was Simon Carfax , and he came as the captain of a gang from one of the Cornish stannaries . Gwenny Carfax , my young maid , well remembers how her father was brought up from Cornwall . Her mother had been buried , just a week or so before ; and he was sad about it , and had been off his work , and was ready for another job . Then people came to him by night , and said that he must want a change , and everybody lost their wives , and work was the way to mend it . So what with grief , and over - thought , and the inside of a square bottle , Gwenny says they brought him off , to become a mighty captain , and choose the country round . The last she saw of him was this , that he went down a ladder somewhere on the wilds of Exmoor , leaving her with bread and cheese , and his travelling - hat to see to . And from that day to this he never came above the ground again ; so far as we can hear of . '
73028	73185	73186	73186	I	0	' That very day I chanced to return from Aunt Sabina 's dying - place ; for she would not die in Glen Doone , she said , lest the angels feared to come for her ; and so she was taken to a cottage in a lonely valley . I was allowed to visit her , for even we durst not refuse the wishes of the dying ; and if a priest had been desired , we should have made bold with him . Returning very sorrowful , and caring now for nothing , I found this little stray thing lying , her arms upon her , and not a sign of life , except the way that she was biting . Black root - stuff was in her mouth , and a piece of dirty sheep 's wool , and at her feet an old egg - shell of some bird of the moorland . '
73271	73559	73561	73561	she	2419	' Gwenny took me for an angel though I am little like one , as you see , Master Ridd ; and she followed me , expecting that I would open wings and fly when we came to any difficulty . I brought her home with me , so far as this can be a home , and she made herself my sole attendant , without so much as asking me . She has beaten two or three other girls , who used to wait upon me , until they are afraid to come near the house of my grandfather . She seems to have no kind of fear even of our roughest men ; and yet she looks with reverence and awe upon the Counsellor . As for the wickedness , and theft , and revelry around her , she says it is no concern of hers , and they know their own business best . By this way of regarding men she has won upon our riders , so that she is almost free from all control of place and season , and is allowed to pass where none even of the youths may go . Being so wide , and short , and flat , she has none to pay her compliments ; and , were there any , she would scorn them , as not being Cornishmen . Sometimes she wanders far , by moonlight , on the moors and up the rivers , to give her father as she says another chance of finding her , and she comes back not a wit defeated , or discouraged , or depressed , but confident that he is only waiting for the proper time . '
73679	73839	73658	73658	I	0	' Ah me ! We are to be pitied greatly , rather than condemned , by people whose things we have taken from them ; for I have read , and seem almost to understand about it , that there are places on the earth where gentle peace , and love of home , and knowledge of one 's neighbours prevail , and are , with reason , looked for as the usual state of things . There honest folk may go to work in the glory of the sunrise , with hope of coming home again quite safe in the quiet evening , and finding all their children ; and even in the darkness they have no fear of lying down , and dropping off to slumber , and hearken to the wind of night , not as to an enemy trying to find entrance , but a friend who comes to tell the value of their comfort .

73999	74069	73984	73985	Master Ridd	261	' But I , John Ridd , being young and new , and very fond of hearing things to make my blood to tingle , had no more of manners than to urge poor Lorna onwards , hoping , perhaps , in depth of heart , that she might have to hold by me , when the worst came to the worst of it . Therefore she went on again .
74076	74188	74074	74074	HER	390	' It is not a twelvemonth yet , although it seems ten years agone , since I blew the downy globe to learn the time of day , or set beneath my chin the veinings of the varnished buttercup , or fired the fox - glove cannonade , or made a captive of myself with dandelion fetters ; for then I had not very much to trouble me in earnest , but went about , romancing gravely , playing at bo - peep with fear , making for myself strong heroes of gray rock or fir - tree , adding to my own importance , as the children love to do .

74450	74644	74416	74416	his	2435	' But now , at the time I speak of , one evening of last summer , a horrible thing befell , which took all play of childhood from me . The fifteenth day of last July was very hot and sultry , long after the time of sundown ; and I was paying heed of it , because of the old saying that if it rain then , rain will fall on forty days thereafter . I had been long by the waterside at this lower end of the valley , plaiting a little crown of woodbine crocketed with sprigs of heath to please my grandfather , who likes to see me gay at supper - time . Being proud of my tiara , which had cost some trouble , I set it on my head at once , to save the chance of crushing , and carrying my gray hat , ventured by a path not often trod . For I must be home at the supper - time , or grandfather would be exceeding wrath ; and the worst of his anger is that he never condescends to show it . '
74761	74880	74898	74899	a man	1295	' It was more almost than dusk , down below the tree - leaves , and I was eager to go through , and be again beyond it . For the gray dark hung around me , scarcely showing shadow ; and the little light that glimmered seemed to come up from the ground . For the earth was strown with the winter - spread and coil of last year 's foliage , the lichened claws of chalky twigs , and the numberless decay which gives a light in its decaying .

But I pray you keep it still , unless you would give to dusty death your very best cousin and trusty guardian , Alan Brandir of Loch Awe . " '
75035	75068	75011	75011	I	0	' " I have in truth that honour , madam , " he answered , with a sweeping bow ; " unless I err in taking you for Mistress Lorna Doone . " '
75083	75127	75079	75080	Lorna Doone	311	' He looked at me , with gravity , and was inclined to make some claim to closer consideration upon the score of kinship ; but I shrunk back , and only said , " Yes , my name is Lorna Doone . " '

75226	75304	75316	75316	he	0	' Upon hearing this I looked at him , for that seemed then a venerable age ; but the more I looked the more I doubted , although he was dressed quite like a man . He led me in a courtly manner , stepping at his tallest to an open place beside the water ; where the light came as in channel , and was made the most of by glancing waves and fair white stones . '

75502	75625	75630	75630	I	0	' " I fear that my presence hath scarce enough of ferocity about it , " he gave a jerk to his sword as he spoke , and clanked it on the brook - stones ; " yet do I assure you , cousin , that I am not without some prowess ; and many a master of defence hath this good sword of mine disarmed . Now if the boldest and biggest robber in all this charming valley durst so much as breathe the scent of that flower coronal , which doth not adorn but is adorned " here he talked some nonsense " I would cleave him from head to foot , ere ever he could fly or cry .

And as I gazed on this slight fair youth , clearly one of high birth and breeding albeit over - boastful , a chill of fear crept over me ; because he had no strength or substance , and would be no more than a pin - cushion before the great swords of the Doones .

With this he kindled the tip of the stick , until it glowed with a ring of red , and then he breathed forth curls of smoke , blue and smelling on the air like spice . I had never seen this done before , though acquainted with tobacco - pipes ; and it made me laugh , until I thought of the peril that must follow it . '
76408	76435	76437	76437	you	2486	' " Sir , " I answered , being amused by his manner , which was new to me for the Doones are much in earnest , '
76458	76544	76437	76437	you	2486	' " If it be so , it is in truth the very highest honour and would heal ten holes in our escutcheon . What noble family but springs from a captain among robbers ? Trade alone can spoil our blood ; robbery purifies it . The robbery of one age is the chivalry of the next . We may start anew , and vie with even the nobility of France , if we can once enrol but half the Doones upon our lineage . " '
76594	76691	76577	76577	you	2486	' " That I will do . You are my ward because you were my father 's ward , under the Scottish law ; and now my father being so deaf , I have succeeded to that right at least in my own opinion under which claim I am here to neglect my trust no longer , but to lead you away from scenes and deeds which though of good repute and comely are not the best for young gentlewomen . There spoke I not like a guardian ? After that can you mistrust me ? " '
76762	76852	76747	76747	he	2170	' " I thank you much , kind Mistress Lorna , to lead the goose into the fox 's den ! But , setting by all thought of danger , I have other reasons against it . Now , come with your faithful guardian , child . I will pledge my honour against all harm , and to bear you safe to London . By the law of the realm , I am now entitled to the custody of your fair person , and of all your chattels . " '

76954	77151	76934	76934	you	8749	' I turned aside , and thought a little . Although he seemed so light of mind , and gay in dress and manner , I could not doubt his honesty ; and saw , beneath his jaunty air , true mettle and ripe bravery . Scarce had I thought of his project twice , until he spoke of my aunt , his mother , but then the form of my dearest friend , my sweet Aunt Sabina , seemed to come and bid me listen , for this was what she prayed for . Moreover I felt though not as now that Doone Glen was no place for me or any proud young maiden . But while I thought , the yellow lightning spread behind a bulk of clouds , three times ere the flash was done , far off and void of thunder ; and from the pile of cloud before it , cut as from black paper , and lit to depths of blackness by the blaze behind it , a form as of an aged man , sitting in a chair loose - mantled , seemed to lift a hand and warn .

And yet , " he added , with the smile of his accustomed gaiety , " it would have been an unco thing , as we say in Scotland , for her ladyship to have waited upon you , as her graceless son has done , and hopes to do again ere long . Down the cliffs I came , and up them I must make way back again . Now adieu , fair Cousin Lorna , I see you are in haste tonight ; but I am right proud of my guardianship . Give me just one flower for token " here he kissed his hand to me , and I threw him a truss of woodbine " adieu , fair cousin , trust me well , I will soon be here again . " '

77934	77997	77999	78000	Lorna Doone	311	' Yet hearkening , as a coward does , through the brushing of the wind , and echo of far noises , I heard a sharp sound as of iron , and a fall of heavy wood . No unmanly shriek came with it , neither cry for mercy . Carver Doone knows what it was ; and so did Alan Brandir . '
79248	81556	79230	79230	mother	1006	' house , suddenly there came up to them , as if from the very heart of the earth , that long , low , hollow , mysterious sound which I spoke of in winter . The young man started in his saddle , let the horn fall on the horse - steps , and gazed all around in wonder ; while as for Annie , she turned like a ghost , and tried to slam the door , but failed through the violence of her trembling ; for never till now had any one heard it so close at hand as you might say or in the mere fall of the twilight . And by this time there was no man , at least in our parish , but knew for the Parson himself had told us so that it was the devil groaning because the Doones were too many for him . Marwood de Whichehalse was not so alarmed but what he saw a fine opportunity . He leaped from his horse , and laid hold of dear Annie in a highly comforting manner ; and she never would tell us about it being so shy and modest , whether in breathing his comfort to her he tried to take some from her pure lips . I hope he did not , because that to me would seem not the deed of a gentleman , and he was of good old family . At this very moment , who should come into the end of the passage upon them but the heavy writer of these doings I , John Ridd myself , and walking the faster , it may be , on account of the noise I mentioned . I entered the house with some wrath upon me at seeing the gazehounds in the yard ; for it seems a cruel thing to me to harass the birds in the breeding - time . And to my amazement there I saw Squire Marwood among the milk - pans with his arm around our Annie 's waist , and Annie all blushing and coaxing him off , for she was not come to scold yet . Perhaps I was wrong ; God knows , and if I was , no doubt I shall pay for it ; but I gave him the flat of my hand on his head , and down he went in the thick of the milk - pans . He would have had my fist , I doubt , but for having been at school with me ; and after that it is like enough he would never have spoken another word . As it was , he lay stunned , with the cream running on him ; while I took poor Annie up and carried her in to mother , who had heard the noise and was frightened . Concerning this matter I asked no more , but held myself ready to bear it out in any form convenient , feeling that I had done my duty , and cared not for the consequence ; only for several days dear Annie seemed frightened rather than grateful . But the oddest result of it was that Eliza , who had so despised me , and made very rude verses about me , now came trying to sit on my knee , and kiss me , and give me the best of the pan . However , I would not allow it , because I hate sudden changes . Another thing also astonished me namely , a beautiful letter from Marwood de Whichehalse himself sent by a groom soon afterwards , in which he apologised to me , as if I had been his equal , for his rudeness to my sister , which was not intended in the least , but came of their common alarm at the moment , and his desire to comfort her . Also he begged permission to come and see me , as an old schoolfellow , and set everything straight between us , as should be among honest Blundellites . All this was so different to my idea of fighting out a quarrel , when once it is upon a man , that I knew not what to make of it , but bowed to higher breeding . Only one thing I resolved upon , that come when he would he should not see Annie . And to do my sister justice , she had no desire to see him . However , I am too easy , there is no doubt of that , being very quick to forgive a man , and very slow to suspect , unless he hath once lied to me . Moreover , as to Annie , it had always seemed to me much against my wishes that some shrewd love of a waiting sort was between her and Tom Faggus : and though Tom had made his fortune now , and everybody respected him , of course he was not to be compared , in that point of respectability , with those people who hanged the robbers when fortune turned against them . So young Squire Marwood came again , as though I had never smitten him , and spoke of it in as light a way as if we were still at school together . It was not in my nature , of course , to keep any anger against him ; and I knew what a condescension it was for him to visit us . And it is a very grievous thing , which touches small landowners , to see an ancient family day by day decaying : and when we heard that Ley Barton itself , and all the Manor of Lynton were under a heavy mortgage debt to John Lovering of Weare - Gifford , there was not much , in our little way , that we would not gladly do or suffer for the benefit of De Whichehalse . Meanwhile the work of the farm was toward , and every day gave us more ado to dispose of what itself was doing . For after the long dry skeltering wind of March and part of April , there had been a fortnight of soft wet ; and when the sun came forth again , hill and valley , wood and meadow , could not make enough of him . Many a spring have I seen since then , but never yet two springs alike , and never one so beautiful . Or was it that my love came forth and touched the world with beauty ? The spring was in our valley now ; creeping first for shelter shyly in the pause of the blustering wind . There the lambs came bleating to her , and the orchis lifted up , and the thin dead leaves of clover lay for the new ones to spring through . There the stiffest things that sleep , the stubby oak , and the saplin'd beech , dropped their brown defiance to her , and prepared for a soft reply . While her over - eager children who had started forth to meet her , through the frost and shower of sleet , catkin'd hazel , gold - gloved withy , youthful elder , and old woodbine , with all the tribe of good hedge - climbers who must hasten while haste they may was there one of them that did not claim the merit of coming first ? There she stayed and held her revel , as soon as the fear of frost was gone ; all the air was a fount of freshness , and the earth of gladness , and the laughing waters prattled of the kindness of the sun . But all this made it much harder for us , plying the hoe and rake , to keep the fields with room upon them for the corn to tiller . The winter wheat was well enough , being sturdy and strong - sided ; but the spring wheat and the barley and the oats were overrun by ill weeds growing faster . Therefore , as the old saying is , Farmer , that thy wife may thrive , Let not burr and burdock wive ; And if thou wouldst keep thy son , See that bine and gith have none . So we were compelled to go down the field and up it , striking in and out with care where the green blades hung together , so that each had space to move in and to spread its roots abroad . And I do assure you now , though you may not believe me , it was harder work to keep John Fry , Bill Dadds , and Jem Slocomb all in a line and all moving nimbly to the tune of my own tool , than it was to set out in the morning alone , and hoe half an acre by dinner - time . For , instead of keeping the good ash moving , they would for ever be finding something to look at or to speak of , or at any rate , to stop with ; blaming the shape of their tools perhaps , or talking about other people 's affairs ; or , what was most irksome of all to me , taking advantage as married men , and whispering jokes of no excellence about my having , or having not , or being ashamed of a sweetheart . And this went so far at last that I was forced to take two of them and knock their heads together ; after which they worked with a better will . When we met together in the evening round the kitchen chimney - place , after the men had had their supper and their heavy boots were gone , my mother and Eliza would do their very utmost to learn what I was thinking of . Not that we kept any fire now , after the crock was emptied ; but that we loved to see the ashes cooling , and to be together . At these times Annie would never ask me any crafty questions as Eliza did , but would sit with her hair untwined , and one hand underneath her chin , sometimes looking softly at me , as much as to say that she knew it all and I was no worse off than she . But strange to say my mother dreamed not , even for an instant , that it was possible for Annie to be thinking of such a thing . She was so very good and quiet , and careful of the linen , and clever about the cookery and fowls and bacon - curing , that people used to laugh , and say she would never look at a bachelor until her mother ordered her . But I perhaps from my own condition and the sense of what it was felt no certainty about this , and even had another opinion , as was said before . Often I was much inclined to speak to her about it , and put her on her guard against the approaches of Tom Faggus ; but I could not find how to begin , and feared to make a breach between us ; knowing that if her mind was set , no words of mine would alter it ; although they needs must grieve her deeply . Moreover , I felt that , in this case , a certain homely Devonshire proverb would come home to me ; that one , I mean , which records that the crock was calling the kettle smutty . Not , of course , that I compared my innocent maid to a highwayman ; but that Annie might think her worse , and would be too apt to do so , if indeed she loved Tom Faggus . And our Cousin Tom , by this time , was living a quiet and godly life ; having retired almost from the trade except when he needed excitement , or came across public officers , and having won the esteem of all whose purses were in his power . Perhaps it is needless for me to say that all this time while my month was running or rather crawling , for never month went so slow as that with me neither weed , nor seed , nor cattle , nor my own mother 's anxiety , nor any care for my sister , kept me from looking once every day , and even twice on a Sunday , for any sign of Lorna . For my heart was ever weary ; in the budding valleys , and by the crystal waters , looking at the lambs in fold , or the heifers on the mill , labouring in trickled furrows , or among the beaded blades ; halting fresh to see the sun lift over the golden - vapoured ridge ; or doffing hat , from sweat of brow , to watch him sink in the low gray sea ; be it as it would of day , of work , or night , or slumber , it was a weary heart I bore , and fear was on the brink of it . All the beauty of the spring went for happy men to think of ; all the increase of the year was for other eyes to mark . Not a sign of any sunrise for me from my fount of life , not a breath to stir the dead leaves fallen on my heart 's Spring .

Being vexed about this and having to stop at home nearly half the evening , I lost good manners so much as to ask him even in our own house ! what he meant by not mending the swing - hurdle where the Lynn stream flows from our land into his , and which he is bound to maintain . But he looked at me in a superior manner , and said , '
81903	82110	81896	81897	young man	1660	' I had other reason for being vexed with Farmer Nicholas just now , viz . that I had heard a rumour , after church one Sunday when most of all we sorrow over the sins of one another that Master Nicholas Snowe had been seen to gaze tenderly at my mother , during a passage of the sermon , wherein the parson spoke well and warmly about the duty of Christian love . Now , putting one thing with another , about the bees , and about some ducks , and a bullock with a broken knee - cap , I more than suspected that Farmer Nicholas was casting sheep 's eyes at my mother ; not only to save all further trouble in the matter of the hurdle , but to override me altogether upon the difficult question of damming . And I knew quite well that John Fry 's wife never came to help at the washing without declaring that it was a sin for a well - looking woman like mother , with plenty to live on , and only three children , to keep all the farmers for miles around so unsettled in their minds about her . Mother used to answer '
82126	82239	82122	82122	your	403	' But we always saw that she smoothed her apron , and did her hair up afterwards , and that Mistress Fry went home at night with a cold pig 's foot or a bowl of dripping . Therefore , on that very night , as I could not well speak to mother about it , without seeming undutiful , after lighting the three young ladies for so in sooth they called themselves all the way home with our stable - lanthorn , I begged good leave of Farmer Nicholas who had hung some way behind us to say a word in private to him , before he entered his own house .

The King had heard what her son was , how sober , and quiet , and diligent , and the strongest young man in England ; and being himself such a reprobate God forgive her for saying so he could never rest till he got poor Johnny , and made him as dissolute as himself .

But though I tried every possible means with Master Jeremy Stickles , offering him the choice for dinner of every beast that was on the farm , he durst not put off our departure later than the Saturday . And nothing else but love of us and of our hospitality would have so persuaded him to remain with us till then . Therefore now my only chance of seeing Lorna , before I went , lay in watching from the cliff and espying her , or a signal from her . This , however , I did in vain , until my eyes were weary and often would delude themselves with hope of what they ached for . But though I lay hidden behind the trees upon the crest of the stony fall , and waited so quiet that the rabbits and squirrels played around me , and even the keen - eyed weasel took me for a trunk of wood it was all as one ; no cast of colour changed the white stone , whose whiteness now was hateful to me ; nor did wreath or skirt of maiden break the loneliness of the vale .

No case before the court whatever ; no primary deposition , so far as we are furnished ; not even a King 's writ issued and here we have a fine young man dragged from his home and adoring mother , during the height of agriculture , at his own cost and charges ! I have heard of many grievances ; but this the very worst of all . Nothing short of a Royal Commission could be warranty for it . This is not only illegal , sir , but most gravely unconstitutional .

For the honour of the profession , and my position in it , I ought to charge thee at least five guineas , although I would have accepted one , offered with good will and delicacy .

This money shall be paid , if due , albeit I had no desire to incur the debt . You have advised me that the Court is liable for my expenses , so far as they be reasonable . If this be a reasonable expense , come with me now to Lord Justice Jeffreys , and receive from him the two guineas , or it may be five , for the counsel you have given me to deny his jurisdiction . '

93382	93418	93419	93420	John Ridd	261	' And he swung himself to and fro on his bench , with both hands on his knees ; and every man waited to let it pass , knowing better than to speak to him . '
93422	93455	93456	93456	thou	2952	' said the Lord Chief Justice , at last recovering a sort of dignity , yet daring Spank from the corners of his eyes to do so much as look at him , '
93490	93509	93511	93511	thou	2952	' here he made a glance at Spank , which was worth at least ten pounds to me ; '
93552	93649	93542	93542	Ridd	261	' I was only too glad to go , after all this tempest ; as you may well suppose . For if ever I saw a man 's eyes become two holes for the devil to glare from , I saw it that day ; and the eyes were those of the Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys . Mr. Spank was in the lobby before me , and before I had recovered myself for I was vexed with my own terror he came up sidling and fawning to me , with a heavy bag of yellow leather . '
93755	93909	93744	93745	Master Ridd	414	' But I would not take the bag from him , regarding it as a sort of bribe to pay me such a lump of money , without so much as asking how great had been my expenses . Therefore I only told him that if he would kindly keep the cash for me until the morrow , I would spend the rest of the day in counting which always is sore work with me how much it had stood me in board and lodging , since Master Stickles had rendered me up ; for until that time he had borne my expenses . In the morning I would give Mr. Spank a memorandum , duly signed , and attested by my landlord , including the breakfast of that day , and in exchange for this I would take the exact amount from the yellow bag , and be very thankful for it . '
93919	93930	93913	93913	thy	2962	' said Spank , looking at me with some contempt , '
93965	93974	93955	93955	thou	2962	' It mattered not to me . The word '
93976	94105	94111	94112	Master Ridd	414	' stuck in my gorge , as used by the Lord Chief Justice ; for we looked upon an approver as a very low thing indeed . I would rather pay for every breakfast , and even every dinner , eaten by me since here I came , than take money as an approver . And indeed I was much disappointed at being taken in that light , having understood that I was sent for as a trusty subject , and humble friend of His Majesty . In the morning I met Mr. Spank waiting for me at the entrance , and very desirous to see me . I showed him my bill , made out in fair copy , and he laughed at it , and said , '

94225	94251	94252	94252	He	2966	' The clerk smiled cheerfully at this , being proud of his children 's ability ; and then having paid my account , he whispered , '
94325	94353	94319	94319	John	261	' With that he swung up the curtain bravely , and according to special orders , I stood , face to face , and alone with Judge Jeffreys .

94500	94530	94444	94444	he	261	' Only twelvescore pounds , my lord , when I be in wrestling trim . And sure I must have lost weight here , fretting so long in London . '

94550	94569	94414	94414	he	261	' Yes , my lord , twice or even thrice ; and he made some jest concerning me . '
94570	94617	94414	94414	he	261	' A very bad one , I doubt not . His humour is not so dainty as mine , but apt to be coarse and unmannerly . Now John , or Jack , by the look of thee , thou art more used to be called . '

94700	94722	94414	94414	he	261	' Not so , my lord ; I have been at school , and had very bad jokes made upon me . '
94723	94802	94444	94444	he	261	' Ha , ha ! It hath hit thee hard . And faith , it would be hard to miss thee , even with harpoon . And thou lookest like to blubber , now . Capital , in faith ! I have thee on every side , Jack , and thy sides are manifold ; many - folded at any rate . Thou shalt have double expenses , Jack , for the wit thou hast provoked in me . '
94803	94820	94414	94414	he	261	' Heavy goods lack heavy payment , is a proverb down our way , my lord . '
94821	94859	94444	94444	he	261	' Ah , I hurt thee , I hurt thee , Jack . The harpoon hath no tickle for thee . Now , Jack Whale , having hauled thee hard , we will proceed to examine thee . '

96297	96348	96277	96277	John	261	' Here the Lord Justice gave me such a glare that I wished myself well rid of him , though thankful for his warnings ; and seeing how he had made upon me a long abiding mark of fear , he smiled again in a jocular manner , and said , '
96376	96377	96378	96379	My lord	9182	' '
96453	96454	96455	96456	John Ridd	261	' '

96527	97245	97246	97247	John Ridd	261	' I wished to set this matter right ; but his worship would not hear me , and only drove me out of court , saying that men were thieves and liars , no more in one place than another , but all alike all over the world , and women not far behind them . It was not for me to dispute this point though I was not yet persuaded of it , both because my lord was a Judge , and must know more about it , and also that being a man myself I might seem to be defending myself in an unbecoming manner . Therefore I made a low bow , and went ; in doubt as to which had the right of it . But though he had so far dismissed me , I was not yet quite free to go , inasmuch as I had not money enough to take me all the way to Oare , unless indeed I should go afoot , and beg my sustenance by the way , which seemed to be below me . Therefore I got my few clothes packed , and my few debts paid , all ready to start in half an hour , if only they would give me enough to set out upon the road with . For I doubted not , being young and strong , that I could walk from London to Oare in ten days or in twelve at most , which was not much longer than horse - work ; only I had been a fool , as you will say when you hear it . For after receiving from Master Spank the amount of the bill which I had delivered less indeed by fifty shillings than the money my mother had given me , for I had spent fifty shillings , and more , in seeing the town and treating people , which I could not charge to His Majesty I had first paid all my debts thereout , which were not very many , and then supposing myself to be an established creditor of the Treasury for my coming needs , and already scenting the country air , and foreseeing the joy of my mother , what had I done but spent half my balance , ay and more than three - quarters of it , upon presents for mother , and Annie , and Lizzie , John Fry , and his wife , and Betty Muxworthy , Bill Dadds , Jim Slocombe , and , in a word , half of the rest of the people at Oare , including all the Snowe family , who must have things good and handsome ? And if I must while I am about it , hide nothing from those who read me , I had actually bought for Lorna a thing the price of which quite frightened me , till the shopkeeper said it was nothing at all , and that no young man , with a lady to love him , could dare to offer her rubbish , such as the Jew sold across the way . Now the mere idea of beautiful Lorna ever loving me , which he talked about as patly though of course I never mentioned her as if it were a settled thing , and he knew all about it , that mere idea so drove me abroad , that if he had asked three times as much , I could never have counted the money . Now in all this I was a fool of course not for remembering my friends and neighbours , which a man has a right to do , and indeed is bound to do , when he comes from London but for not being certified first what cash I had to go on with . And to my great amazement , when I went with another bill for the victuals of only three days more , and a week 's expense on the homeward road reckoned very narrowly , Master Spank not only refused to grant me any interview , but sent me out a piece of blue paper , looking like a butcher 's ticket , and bearing these words and no more , '
97271	97840	97266	97266	he	3049	' From this I concluded that I had lost favour in the sight of Chief Justice Jeffreys . Perhaps because my evidence had not proved of any value ! perhaps because he meant to let the matter lie , till cast on him . Anyhow , it was a reason of much grief , and some anger to me , and very great anxiety , disappointment , and suspense . For here was the time of the hay gone past , and the harvest of small corn coming on , and the trout now rising at the yellow Sally , and the blackbirds eating our white - heart cherries I was sure , though I could not see them , and who was to do any good for mother , or stop her from weeping continually ? And more than this , what was become of Lorna ? Perhaps she had cast me away altogether , as a flouter and a changeling ; perhaps she had drowned herself in the black well ; perhaps and that was worst of all she was even married , child as she was , to that vile Carver Doone , if the Doones ever cared about marrying ! That last thought sent me down at once to watch for Mr. Spank again , resolved that if I could catch him , spank him I would to a pretty good tune , although sixteen in family . However , there was no such thing as to find him ; and the usher vowed having orders I doubt that he was gone to the sea for the good of his health , having sadly overworked himself ; and that none but a poor devil like himself , who never had handling of money , would stay in London this foul , hot weather ; which was likely to bring the plague with it . Here was another new terror for me , who had heard of the plagues of London , and the horrible things that happened ; and so going back to my lodgings at once , I opened my clothes and sought for spots , especially as being so long at a hairy fellmonger 's ; but finding none , I fell down and thanked God for that same , and vowed to start for Oare to - morrow , with my carbine loaded , come weal come woe , come sun come shower ; though all the parish should laugh at me , for begging my way home again , after the brave things said of my going , as if I had been the King 's cousin . But I was saved in some degree from this lowering of my pride , and what mattered more , of mother 's ; for going to buy with my last crown - piece after all demands were paid a little shot and powder , more needful on the road almost than even shoes or victuals , at the corner of the street I met my good friend Jeremy Stickles , newly come in search of me . I took him back to my little room mine at least till to - morrow morning and told him all my story , and how much I felt aggrieved by it . But he surprised me very much , by showing no surprise at all . '
98017	98084	98002	98002	he	3053	' This was all quite dark to me , for I never looked at things like that , and never would own myself a liar , not at least to other people , nor even to myself , although I might to God sometimes , when trouble was upon me . And if it comes to that , no man has any right to be called a '
98086	98099	98102	98102	thou	3059	' for smoothing over things unwitting , through duty to his neighbour . '
98108	98129	98102	98102	thou	3059	' said Jeremy Stickles suddenly , while I was all abroad with myself as to being a liar or not ; '
98186	98285	98178	98179	John Ridd	261	' For I was ready to kiss his hand , to think that any man in London the meanest and most suspicious place , upon all God 's earth should trust me with five pounds , without even a receipt for it ! It overcame me so that I sobbed ; for , after all , though big in body , I am but a child at heart . It was not the five pounds that moved me , but the way of giving it ; and after so much bitter talk , the great trust in my goodness .

If you like me so ferociously , why do you leave me for other people to do just as they like with me ? '

But they wanted me to give my word , and be formally betrothed to him in the presence of my grandfather . It seems that something frightened them . There is a youth named Charleworth Doone , every one calls him " Charlie " ; a headstrong and a gay young man , very gallant in his looks and manner ; and my uncle , the Counsellor , chose to fancy that Charlie looked at me too much , coming by my grandfather 's cottage . '

104163	104440	104449	104449	her	3261	' Master Ridd , you are worse than Carver ! I thought you were so kind - hearted . Well , they wanted me to promise , and even to swear a solemn oath a thing I have never done in my life that I would we d my eldest cousin , this same Carver Doone , who is twice as old as I am , being thirty - five and upwards . That was why I gave the token that I wished to see you , Master Ridd . They pointed out how much it was for the peace of all the family , and for mine own benefit ; but I would not listen for a moment , though the Counsellor was most eloquent , and my grandfather begged me to consider , and Carver smiled his pleasantest , which is a truly frightful thing . Then both he and his crafty father were for using force with me ; but Sir Ensor would not hear of it ; and they have put off that extreme until he shall be past its knowledge , or , at least , beyond preventing it . And now I am watched , and spied , and followed , and half my little liberty seems to be taken from me . I could not be here speaking with you , even in my own nook and refuge , but for the aid , and skill , and courage of dear little Gwenny Carfax . She is now my chief reliance , and through her alone I hope to baffle all my enemies , since others have forsaken me . '

112893	112934	112883	112883	Annie	324	' she is only beginning to like me , Annie ; and as for loving , she is so young that she only loves her grandfather . But I hope she will come to it by - and - by . '
112935	112941	112943	112944	my sister	8930	' Of course she must , '
112946	112957	112943	112944	my sister	8930	' it will be impossible for her to help it . '
112958	112967	112883	112883	Annie	324	' Ah well ! I do n't know , '
112976	112984	112943	112944	my sister	8930	' Maidens are such wondrous things ! " '
112991	113001	112943	112944	my sister	8930	' said Annie , casting her bright eyes downwards : '

113152	113432	113142	113142	I	0	' And so dear Annie , having grown quite brave , gave me a little push into the parlour , where I was quite abashed to enter after all I had heard about Sally . And I made up my mind to examine her well , and try a little courting with her , if she should lead me on , that I might be in practice for Lorna . But when I perceived how grandly and richly both the young damsels were apparelled ; and how , in their curtseys to me , they retreated , as if I were making up to them , in a way they had learned from Exeter ; and how they began to talk of the Court , as if they had been there all their lives , and the latest mode of the Duchess of this , and the profile of the Countess of that , and the last good saying of my Lord something ; instead of butter , and cream , and eggs , and things which they understood ; I knew there must be somebody in the room besides Jasper Kebby to talk at . And so there was ; for behind the curtain drawn across the window - seat no less a man than Uncle Ben was sitting half asleep and weary ; and by his side a little girl very quiet and very watchful . My mother led me to Uncle Ben , and he took my hand without rising , muttering something not over - polite , about my being bigger than ever . I asked him heartily how he was , and he said , '
113454	113455	113456	113456	I	0	' '

113591	113648	113589	113589	Ruth	348	' However , my good cousin Ruth only arose , and made me a curtsey , and lifted her great brown eyes at me , more in fear , as I thought , than kinship . And if ever any one looked unlike the heiress to great property , it was the little girl before me . '
113666	113675	113659	113659	me	0	' I said , just to encourage her ; '
113694	113712	113686	113686	they	3486	' But Uncle Reuben burst out laughing ; and Ruth turned away with a deep rich colour . '
113724	113734	113735	113735	she	8984	' said Uncle Ben , in his dryest drawl ; '

John had a great jug of ale beside him , and a horn well drained ; and he clearly looked upon himself as a hero , and the maids seemed to be of the same opinion . '

116530	116545	116489	116489	I	0	' Very well , Miss Lizzie , I suppose mother has some right here . '
116603	116630	116600	116600	Lizzie	277	' Do n't be a fool , John . We know things of you , you know ; a great deal more than you dream of . '
116663	116762	116658	116658	she	328	' Lizzie , you talk too fast , my child . No one knows anything of our John which he need be ashamed of ; and working as he does from light to dusk , and earning the living of all of us , he is entitled to choose his own good time for going out and for coming in , without consulting a little girl five years younger than himself . Now , John , sit down , and you shall know all that we have done , though I doubt whether you will approve of it . '
116798	117068	116793	116793	Annie	328	' You must know , dear John , that we have been extremely curious , ever since Uncle Reuben came , to know what he was come for , especially at this time of year , when he is at his busiest . He never vouchsafed any explanation , neither gave any reason , true or false , which shows his entire ignorance of all feminine nature . If Ruth had known , and refused to tell us , we should have been much easier , because we must have got it out of Ruth before two or three days were over . But darling Ruth knew no more than we did , and indeed I must do her the justice to say that she has been quite as inquisitive . Well , we might have put up with it , if it had not been for his taking Dolly , my own pet Dolly , away every morning , quite as if she belonged to him , and keeping her out until close upon dark , and then bringing her home in a frightful condition . And he even had the impudence , when I told him that Dolly was my pony , to say that we owed him a pony , ever since you took from him that little horse upon which you found him strapped so snugly ; and he means to take Dolly to Dulverton with him , to run in his little cart . If there is law in the land he shall not . Surely , John , you will not let him ? '
117069	117075	117077	117077	I	0	' That I wo n't , '
117079	117104	117077	117077	I	0	' except upon the conditions which I offered him once before . If we owe him the pony , we owe him the straps . '
117125	117332	117118	117118	she	324	' Well , John , we were perfectly miserable . You can not understand it , of course ; but I used to go every evening , and hug poor Dolly , and kiss her , and beg her to tell me where she had been , and what she had seen , that day . But never having belonged to Balaam , darling Dolly was quite unsuccessful , though often she strove to tell me , with her ears down , and both eyes rolling . Then I made John Fry tie her tail in a knot , with a piece of white ribbon , as if for adornment , that I might trace her among the hills , at any rate for a mile or two . But Uncle Ben was too deep for that ; he cut off the ribbon before he started , saying he would have no Doones after him . And then , in despair , I applied to you , knowing how quick of foot you are , and I got Ruth and Lizzie to help me , but you answered us very shortly ; and a very poor supper you had that night , according to your deserts . '
117456	117457	117426	117426	John	274	' '
117462	117471	117460	117460	Annie	324	' I cried , in amazement at this , '
117489	117490	117484	117484	you	3592	' '
117562	117563	117553	117555	old John Fry	274	' '
117572	117584	117553	117555	old John Fry	274	' said John Fry , taking a pull at the beer ; '
117594	117595	117600	117600	John	274	' '
117740	117741	117770	117770	you	274	' '
117751	117764	117770	117770	you	274	' John cried , with his mouth in the bullock 's horn . '
117775	117792	117793	117793	John	274	' I asked , with great anxiety ; though I meant to have shown no interest . '
117803	117809	117793	117793	John	274	' Lizzie answered me sharply , '
117820	117821	117824	117824	him	274	' '
117828	117832	117824	117824	him	274	' said I ; '
117857	117858	117859	117859	Hem	441	' '
117861	118609	117859	117859	Hem	441	' cried Lizzie , in a nasty way ; but I took no notice of her , for she was always bad to deal with . Therefore John Fry began again , being heartily glad to do so , that his story might get out of the tumble which all our talk had made in it . But as he could not tell a tale in the manner of my Lorna although he told it very well for those who understood him I will take it from his mouth altogether , and state in brief what happened . When John , upon his forest pony , which he had much ado to hold its mouth being like a bucket , was come to the top of the long black combe , two miles or more from Plover 's Barrows , and winding to the southward , he stopped his little nag short of the crest , and got off and looked ahead of him , from behind a tump of whortles . It was a long flat sweep of moorland over which he was gazing , with a few bogs here and there , and brushy places round them . Of course , John Fry , from his shepherd life and reclaiming of strayed cattle , knew as well as need be where he was , and the spread of the hills before him , although it was beyond our beat , or , rather , I should say , beside it . Not but what we might have grazed there had it been our pleasure , but that it was not worth our while , and scarcely worth Jasper Kebby 's even ; all the land being cropped as one might say with desolation . And nearly all our knowledge of it sprang from the unaccountable tricks of cows who have young calves with them ; at which time they have wild desire to get away from the sight of man , and keep calf and milk for one another , although it be in a barren land . At least , our cows have gotten this trick , and I have heard other people complain of it . John Fry , as I said , knew the place well enough , but he liked it none the more for that , neither did any of our people ; and , indeed , all the neighbourhood of Thomshill and Larksborough , and most of all Black Barrow Down lay under grave imputation of having been enchanted with a very evil spell . Moreover , it was known , though folk were loath to speak of it , even on a summer morning , that Squire Thom , who had been murdered there , a century ago or more , had been seen by several shepherds , even in the middle day , walking with his severed head carried in his left hand , and his right arm lifted towards the sun . Therefore it was very bold in John as I acknowledged to venture across that moor alone , even with a fast pony under him , and some whisky by his side . And he would never have done so of that I am quite certain , either for the sake of Annie 's sweet face , or of the golden guinea , which the three maidens had subscribed to reward his skill and valour . But the truth was that he could not resist his own great curiosity . For , carefully spying across the moor , from behind the tuft of whortles , at first he could discover nothing having life and motion , except three or four wild cattle roving in vain search for nourishment , and a diseased sheep banished hither , and some carrion crows keeping watch on her . But when John was taking his very last look , being only too glad to go home again , and acknowledge himself baffled , he thought he saw a figure moving in the farthest distance upon Black Barrow Down , scarcely a thing to be sure of yet , on account of the want of colour . But as he watched , the figure passed between him and a naked cliff , and appeared to be a man on horseback , making his way very carefully , in fear of bogs and serpents . For all about there it is adders '

And then I thought that perhaps the chance might some day be on the other side . For to tell the truth , I was heartily tired of lurking and playing bo - peep so long ; to which nothing could have reconciled me , except my fear for Lorna . And here I saw was a man of strength fit for me to encounter , such as I had never met , but would be glad to meet with ; having found no man of late who needed not my mercy at wrestling , or at single - stick . And growing more and more uneasy , as I found no Lorna , I would have tried to force the Doone Glen from the upper end , and take my chance of getting back , but for Annie and her prayers . Now that same night I think it was , or at any rate the next one , that I noticed Betty Muxworthy going on most strangely . She made the queerest signs to me , when nobody was looking , and laid her fingers on her lips , and pointed over her shoulder . But I took little heed of her , being in a kind of dudgeon , and oppressed with evil luck ; believing too that all she wanted was to have some little grumble about some petty grievance .

They had resigned themselves , as even pigs do , to a kind of fast , hoping to break their fast more sweetly on the morrow morning . But now they tumbled out all headlong , pigs below and pigs above , pigs point - blank and pigs across , pigs courant and pigs rampant , but all alike prepared to eat , and all in good cadence squeaking .

However , by the afternoon , when the sun began to go down upon us , our mother sat on the garden bench , with her head on my great otter - skin waistcoat which was waterproof , and her right arm round our Annie 's waist , and scarcely knowing which of us she ought to make the most of , or which deserved most pity . Not that she had forgiven yet the rivals to her love Tom Faggus , I mean , and Lorna but that she was beginning to think a tattle better of them now , and a vast deal better of her own children . And it helped her much in this regard , that she was not thinking half so well as usual of herself , or rather of her own judgment ; for in good truth she had no self , only as it came home to her , by no very distant road , but by way of her children . A better mother never lived ; and can I , after searching all things , add another word to that ? And indeed poor Lizzie was not so very bad ; but behaved on the whole very well for her . She was much to be pitied , poor thing , and great allowances made for her , as belonging to a well - grown family , and a very comely one ; and feeling her own shortcomings . This made her leap to the other extreme , and reassert herself too much , endeavouring to exalt the mind at the expense of the body ; because she had the invisible one so far as can be decided in better share than the visible . Not but what she had her points , and very comely points of body ; lovely eyes to wit , and very beautiful hands and feet almost as good as Lorna 's , and a neck as white as snow ; but Lizzie was not gifted with our gait and port , and bounding health . Now , while we sat on the garden bench , under the great ash - tree , we left dear mother to take her own way , and talk at her own pleasure . Children almost always are more wide - awake than their parents . The fathers and the mothers laugh ; but the young ones have the best of them . And now both Annie knew , and I , that we had gotten the best of mother ; and therefore we let her lay down the law , as if we had been two dollies . '

I thank you all for your kindness to me , which has been very great , far more than a little dwarfish creature could , for her own sake , expect .

Look at it , what a queer old thing ! There are some ancient marks upon it , very grotesque and wonderful ; it looks like a cat in a tree almost , but never mind what it looks like . This old ring must have been a giant 's ; therefore it will fit you perhaps , you enormous John . It has been on the front of my old glass necklace which my grandfather found them taking away , and very soon made them give back again ever since I can remember ; and long before that , as some woman told me .

It is nothing more nor less than a very ancient thumb - ring , such as once in my father 's time was ploughed up out of the ground in our farm , and sent to learned doctors , who told us all about it , but kept the ring for their trouble . I will accept it , my own one love ; and it shall go to my grave with me . '

135139	135515	135523	135523	him	3975	' Being carried beyond myself by his insolence about Lorna , I looked at Master Stickles so , and spake in such a voice , that all his daring courage and his spotless honour quailed within him , and he shrank as if I would strike so small a man . Then I left him , and went to work at the sacks upon the corn - floor , to take my evil spirit from me before I should see mother . For to tell the truth now my strength was full , and troubles were gathering round me , and people took advantage so much of my easy temper , sometimes when I was over - tried , a sudden heat ran over me , and a glowing of all my muscles , and a tingling for a mighty throw , such as my utmost self - command , and fear of hurting any one , could but ill refrain . Afterwards , I was always very sadly ashamed of myself , knowing how poor a thing bodily strength is , as compared with power of mind , and that it is a coward 's part to misuse it upon weaker folk . For the present there was a little breach between Master Stickles and me , for which I blamed myself very sorely . But though , in full memory of his kindness and faithfulness in London , I asked his pardon many times for my foolish anger with him , and offered to undergo any penalty he would lay upon me , he only said it was no matter , there was nothing to forgive . When people say that , the truth often is that they can forgive nothing . So for the present a breach was made between Master Jeremy and myself , which to me seemed no great loss , inasmuch as it relieved me from any privity to his dealings , for which I had small liking . All I feared was lest I might , in any way , be ungrateful to him ; but when he would have no more of me , what could I do to help it ? However , in a few days '

An admirably just and virtuous will ; all your effects to your nearest of kin ; filial and fraternal duty thoroughly exemplified ; nothing diverted to alien channels , except a small token of esteem and reverence to an elderly lady , I presume : and which may or may not be valid , or invalid , on the ground of uncertainty , or the absence of any legal status on the part of the legatee . Ha , ha ! Yes , yes ! Few young men are so free from exceptionable entanglements . Two guineas is my charge , sir : and a rare good will for the money . Very prudent of you , sir .

138560	138570	138571	138571	I	0	' How long am I to stand crouching here ? '

As he reeled a little in his gait , and I would not move from his way one inch , after his talk of Lorna , but only longed to grasp him if common sense permitted it , his braided coat came against my thumb , and his leathern gaiters brushed my knee . If he had turned or noticed it , he would have been a dead man in a moment ; but his drunkenness saved him . So I let him reel on unharmed ; and thereupon it occurred to me that I could have no better guide , passing as he would exactly where I wished to be ; that is to say under Lorna 's window . Therefore I followed him without any especial caution ; and soon I had the pleasure of seeing his form against the moonlit sky . Down a steep and winding path , with a handrail at the corners such as they have at Ilfracombe , Master Charlie tripped along and indeed there was much tripping , and he must have been an active fellow to recover as he did and after him walked I , much hoping for his own poor sake that he might not turn and espy me . But Bacchus of whom I read at school , with great wonder about his meaning and the same I may say of Venus that great deity preserved Charlie , his pious worshipper , from regarding consequences . So he led me very kindly to the top of the meadow land , where the stream from underground broke forth , seething quietly with a little hiss of bubbles . Hence I had fair view and outline of the robbers '

140026	140077	139945	139945	Charlie	310	' Mayhap , Master Carver , it is more than thou couldst do . But I will not keep thee ; thou art not pleasant company to - night . All I want is a light for my lanthorn , and a glass of schnapps , if thou hast it . '
140078	140097	139945	139945	Charlie	310	' What is become of thy light , then ? Good for thee I am not on duty . '
140098	140134	139979	139981	the great beast	4123	' A great owl flew between me and Phelps , as we watched beside the culvern , and so scared was he at our fierce bright eyes that he fell and knocked the light out . '
140135	140173	139945	139945	Charlie	310	' Likely tale , or likely lie , Charles ! We will have the truth to - morrow . Here take thy light , and be gone with thee . All virtuous men are in bed now . '
140174	140196	139945	139945	Charlie	310	' Then so will I be , and why art thou not ? Ha , have I earned my schnapps now ? '

142351	142367	142344	142344	Carver	260	' said I , at the mere idea ; in a tone which frightened Lorna . '
142373	142386	142371	142371	John	274	' she whispered sadly , and my blood grew cold at it : '

142507	142664	142445	142445	you	274	' and she said the same to me , in a very low sad voice . And then I stole below Carver 's house , in the shadow from the eastern cliff ; and knowing enough of the village now to satisfy all necessity , betook myself to my well - known track in returning from the valley ; which was neither down the waterslide a course I feared in the darkness nor up the cliffs at Lorna 's bower ; but a way of my own inventing , which there is no need to dwell upon . A weight of care was off my mind ; though much of trouble hung there still . One thing was quite certain if Lorna could not have John Ridd , no one else should have her . And my mother , who sat up for me , and with me long time afterwards , agreed that this was comfort .
143277	143285	143270	143271	John Fry	274	' run and fetch my horse , John '

One day Squire Faggus had dropped in upon us , just in time for dinner ; and very soon he and King 's messenger were as thick as need be . Tom had brought his beloved mare to show her off to Annie , and he mounted his pretty sweetheart upon her , after giving Winnie notice to be on her very best behaviour . The squire was in great spirits , having just accomplished a purchase of land which was worth ten times what he gave for it ; and this he did by a merry trick upon old Sir Roger Bassett , who never supposed him to be in earnest , as not possessing the money . The whole thing was done on a bumper of claret in a tavern where they met ; and the old knight having once pledged his word , no lawyers could hold him back from it . They could only say that Master Faggus , being attainted of felony , was not a capable grantee . '
143894	143898	143888	143888	I	0	' quoth Tom , '
143918	144077	143912	143912	I	0	' And now he was telling our Annie , who listened very rosily , and believed every word he said , that , having been ruined in early innocence by the means of lawyers , it was only just , and fair turn for turn , that having become a match for them by long practice upon the highway , he should reinstate himself , at their expense , in society . And now he would go to London at once , and sue out his pardon , and then would his lovely darling Annie , etc . , etc . things which I had no right to hear , and in which I was not wanted . Therefore I strode away up the lane to my afternoon 's employment , sadly comparing my love with theirs which now appeared so prosperous , yet heartily glad for Annie 's sake ; only remembering now and then the old proverb '
144083	144196	143912	143912	I	0	' I worked very hard in the copse of young ash , with my billhook and a shearing - knife ; cutting out the saplings where they stooled too close together , making spars to keep for thatching , wall - crooks to drive into the cob , stiles for close sheep hurdles , and handles for rakes , and hoes , and two - bills , of the larger and straighter stuff . And all the lesser I bound in faggots , to come home on the sledd to the woodrick . It is not to be supposed that I did all this work , without many peeps at the seven rooks '
144932	145172	145409	145409	Somebody	1024	' nests , or whether it would be too dark for it . It was now a quarter of an hour mayhap , since I had made any chopping noise , because I had been assorting my spars , and tying them in bundles , instead of plying the bill - hook ; and the gentle tinkle of the stream was louder than my doings . To this , no doubt , I owe my life , which then without my dreaming it was in no little jeopardy . For , just as I was twisting the bine of my very last faggot , before tucking the cleft tongue under , there came three men outside the hedge , where the western light was yellow ; and by it I could see that all three of them carried firearms . These men were not walking carelessly , but following down the hedge - trough , as if to stalk some enemy : and for a moment it struck me cold to think it was I they were looking for . With the swiftness of terror I concluded that my visits to Glen Doone were known , and now my life was the forfeit . It was a most lucky thing for me , that I heard their clothes catch in the brambles , and saw their hats under the rampart of ash , which is made by what we call '
145175	145408	145409	145409	Somebody	1024	' and lucky , for me that I stood in a goyal , and had the dark coppice behind me . To this I had no time to fly , but with a sort of instinct , threw myself flat in among the thick fern , and held my breath , and lay still as a log . For I had seen the light gleam on their gun - barrels , and knowing the faults of the neighbourhood , would fain avoid swelling their number . Then the three men came to the gap in the hedge , where I had been in and out so often ; and stood up , and looked in over . It is all very well for a man to boast that , in all his life , he has never been frightened , and believes that he never could be so . There may be men of that nature I will not dare to deny it ; only I have never known them . The fright I was now in was horrible , and all my bones seemed to creep inside me ; when lying there helpless , with only a billet and the comb of fern to hide me , in the dusk of early evening , I saw three faces in the gap ; and what was worse , three gun - muzzles .

And yet , I thank God that I have not any of these . '

147360	147377	147349	147350	Master Stickles	405	' I might have known thee by thy size , John . What art doing here ? '
147378	147409	147349	147350	Master Stickles	405	' Come to save your life . For God 's sake , go no farther . Three men in the covert there , with long guns , waiting for thee . '
147410	147463	147349	147350	Master Stickles	405	' Ha ! I have been watched of late . That is why I pointed at thee , John . Back round this corner , and get thy breath , and tell me all about it . I never saw a man so hurried . I could beat thee now , John . '
147544	147556	147558	147558	Jeremy	405	' We will let them cool their heels , John Ridd , '
147565	147679	147558	147558	Jeremy	405	' I can not fetch my musketeers either from Glenthorne or Lynmouth , in time to seize the fellows . And three desperate Doones , well - armed , are too many for you and me . One result this attempt will have , it will make us attack them sooner than we had intended . And one more it will have , good John , it will make me thy friend for ever . Shake hands my lad , and forgive me freely for having been so cold to thee . Mayhap , in the troubles coming , it will help thee not a little to have done me this good turn . '
148812	149022	148810	148811	Jeremy Stickles	405	' third business was entirely political ; to learn the temper of our people and the gentle families , to watch the movements of the trained bands which could not always be trusted , to discover any collecting of arms and drilling of men among us , to prevent if need were , by open force any importation of gunpowder , of which there had been some rumour ; in a word , to observe and forestall the enemy . Now in providing for this last - mentioned service , the Government had made a great mistake , doubtless through their anxiety to escape any public attention . For all the disposable force at their emissary 's command amounted to no more than a score of musketeers , and these so divided along the coast as scarcely to suffice for the duty of sentinels . He held a commission , it is true , for the employment of the train - bands , but upon the understanding that he was not to call upon them except as a last resource , for any political object ; although he might use them against the Doones as private criminals , if found needful ; and supposing that he could get them . '
149029	149035	149027	149027	John	261	' he said in conclusion , '
149181	149182	149178	149179	John Ridd	261	' '
149190	149194	149187	149188	the Doones	295	' I said , '
149218	149219	149224	149224	John	261	' '
149325	149326	149327	149327	I	0	' '
149336	149376	149327	149327	I	0	' I answered after consideration ; for the possibility of having no Doones had never yet occurred to me , and we all were so thoroughly used to them , and allowed for it in our year 's reckoning ; '
149395	149396	149397	149397	Thou	4319	' '
149406	149418	149397	149397	Thou	4319	' cried Stickles , laughing , as he shook my hand ; '
149470	149659	149459	149459	thy	4319	' He laughed in a very unseemly manner ; while I descried nothing to laugh about . For we always like to see our way ; and a sudden change upsets us . And unless it were in the loss of the farm , or the death of the King , or of Betty Muxworthy , there was nothing that could so unsettle our minds as the loss of the Doones of Bagworthy . And beside all this , I was thinking , of course , and thinking more than all the rest , about the troubles that might ensue to my own beloved Lorna . If an attack of Glen Doone were made by savage soldiers and rude train - bands , what might happen , or what might not , to my delicate , innocent darling ? Therefore , when Jeremy Stickles again placed the matter before me , commending my strength and courage and skill to flatter me of the highest , and finished by saying that I would be worth at least four common men to him , I cut him short as follows : '
149714	149715	149697	149697	I	0	' '
149721	149725	149697	149697	I	0	' cried Jeremy , '

149788	149789	149779	149779	I	0	' '
149795	149800	149793	149793	John	261	' answered Master Stickles , '
149913	149914	149907	149907	John	261	' '
149920	149926	149907	149907	John	261	' I answered very sternly : '
149946	149947	149937	149937	I	0	' '
150048	150491	150037	150038	the King	8664	' With regard to this , I had nothing to say ; for it seemed to me very reasonable that Uncle Reuben should have first chance of recovering his stolen goods , about which he had made such a sad to - do , and promised himself such vengeance . I made bold , however , to ask Master Stickles at what time he intended to carry out this great and hazardous attempt . He answered that he had several things requiring first to be set in order , and that he must make an inland Journey , even as far as Tiverton , and perhaps Crediton and Exeter , to collect his forces and ammunition for them . For he meant to have some of the yeomanry as well as of the trained bands , so that if the Doones should sally forth , as perhaps they would , on horseback , cavalry might be there to meet them , and cut them off from returning . All this made me very uncomfortable , for many and many reasons , the chief and foremost being of course my anxiety about Lorna . If the attack succeeded , what was to become of her ? Who would rescue her from the brutal soldiers , even supposing that she escaped from the hands of her own people , during the danger and ferocity ? And in smaller ways , I was much put out ; for instance , who would ensure our corn - ricks , sheep , and cattle , ay , and even our fat pigs , now coming on for bacon , against the spreading all over the country of unlicensed marauders ? The Doones had their rights , and understood them , and took them according to prescription , even as the parsons had , and the lords of manors , and the King himself , God save him ! But how were these low soldiering fellows half - starved at home very likely , and only too glad of the fat of the land , and ready , according to our proverb , to burn the paper they fried in , who were they to come hectoring and heroing over us , and Heliogabalising , with our pretty sisters to cook for them , and be chucked under chin perhaps afterwards ? There is nothing England hates so much , according to my sense of it , as that fellows taken from plough - tail , cart - tail , pot - houses and parish - stocks , should be hoisted and foisted upon us after a few months '

I looked , and looked , and rubbed my eyes , and turned to try them by other sights ; and then I looked again ; yes , there could be no doubt about it ; the signal was made for me to come , because my love was in danger . For me to enter the valley now , during the broad daylight , could have brought no comfort , but only harm to the maiden , and certain death to myself . Yet it was more than I could do to keep altogether at distance ; therefore I ran to the nearest place where I could remain unseen , and watched the glen from the wooded height , for hours and hours , impatiently . However , no impatience of mine made any difference in the scene upon which I was gazing . In the part of the valley which I could see , there was nothing moving , except the water , and a few stolen cows , going sadly along , as if knowing that they had no honest right there . It sank very heavily into my heart , with all the beds of dead leaves around it , and there was nothing I cared to do , except blow on my fingers , and long for more wit . For a frost was beginning , which made a great difference to Lorna and to myself , I trow ; as well as to all the five million people who dwell in this island of England ; such a frost as never I saw before , neither hope ever to see again ; a time when it was impossible to milk a cow for icicles , or for a man to shave some of his beard as I liked to do for Lorna 's sake , because she was so smooth without blunting his razor on hard gray ice . No man could '

If John Ridd lived until the year 1740 as so strong a man was bound to do , he must have seen almost a harder frost ; and perhaps it put an end to him ; for then he would be some fourscore years old . But tradition makes him '
155566	156022	156023	156024	Young man	1660	' as he says , up to fivescore years . ED . However , at present there was no frost , although for a fortnight threatening ; and I was too young to know the meaning of the way the dead leaves hung , and the worm - casts prickling like women 's combs , and the leaden tone upon everything , and the dead weight of the sky . Will Watcombe , the old man at Lynmouth , who had been half over the world almost , and who talked so much of the Gulf - stream , had as I afterwards called to mind foretold a very bitter winter this year . But no one would listen to him because there were not so many hips and haws as usual ; whereas we have all learned from our grandfathers that Providence never sends very hard winters , without having furnished a large supply of berries for the birds to feed upon . It was lucky for me , while I waited here , that our very best sheep - dog , old Watch , had chosen to accompany me that day . For otherwise I must have had no dinner , being unpersuaded , even by that , to quit my survey of the valley . However , by aid of poor Watch , I contrived to obtain a supply of food ; for I sent him home with a note to Annie fastened upon his chest ; and in less than an hour back he came , proud enough to wag his tail off , with his tongue hanging out from the speed of his journey , and a large lump of bread and of bacon fastened in a napkin around his neck . I had not told my sister , of course , what was toward ; for why should I make her anxious ? When it grew towards dark , I was just beginning to prepare for my circuit around the hills ; but suddenly Watch gave a long low growl ; I kept myself close as possible , and ordered the dog to be silent , and presently saw a short figure approaching from a thickly - wooded hollow on the left side of my hiding - place . It was the same figure I had seen once before in the moonlight , at Plover 's Barrows ; and proved , to my great delight , to be the little maid Gwenny Carfax . She started a moment , at seeing me , but more with surprise than fear ; and then she laid both her hands upon mine , as if she had known me for twenty years . '

I could not understand him then ; any more than a baby playing with his grandfather 's spectacles ; nevertheless I wondered whether , at his time of life , or rather on the brink of death , he was thinking of his youth and pride .

162485	163197	162483	162484	Master Stickles	405	' men , who had been out all the night , said that no snow began to fall until nearly midnight . And here it was , blocking up the doors , stopping the ways , and the water courses , and making it very much worse to walk than in a saw - pit newly used . However , we trudged along in a line ; I first , and the other men after me ; trying to keep my track , but finding legs and strength not up to it . Most of all , John Fry was groaning ; certain that his time was come , and sending messages to his wife , and blessings to his children . For all this time it was snowing harder than it ever had snowed before , so far as a man might guess at it ; and the leaden depth of the sky came down , like a mine turned upside down on us . Not that the flakes were so very large ; for I have seen much larger flakes in a shower of March , while sowing peas ; but that there was no room between them , neither any relaxing , nor any change of direction . Watch , like a good and faithful dog , followed us very cheerfully , leaping out of the depth , which took him over his back and ears already , even in the level places ; while in the drifts he might have sunk to any distance out of sight , and never found his way up again . However , we helped him now and then , especially through the gaps and gateways ; and so after a deal of floundering , some laughter , and a little swearing , we came all safe to the lower meadow , where most of our flock was hurdled . But behold , there was no flock at all ! None , I mean , to be seen anywhere ; only at one corner of the field , by the eastern end , where the snow drove in , a great white billow , as high as a barn , and as broad as a house . This great drift was rolling and curling beneath the violent blast , tufting and combing with rustling swirls , and carved as in patterns of cornice where the grooving chisel of the wind swept round . Ever and again the tempest snatched little whiffs from the channelled edges , twirled them round and made them dance over the chime of the monster pile , then let them lie like herring - bones , or the seams of sand where the tide has been . And all the while from the smothering sky , more and more fiercely at every blast , came the pelting , pitiless arrows , winged with murky white , and pointed with the barbs of frost . But although for people who had no sheep , the sight was a very fine one so far at least as the weather permitted any sight at all ; yet for us , with our flock beneath it , this great mount had but little charm . Watch began to scratch at once , and to howl along the sides of it ; he knew that his charge was buried there , and his business taken from him . But we four men set to in earnest , digging with all our might and main , shovelling away at the great white pile , and fetching it into the meadow . Each man made for himself a cave , scooping at the soft , cold flux , which slid upon him at every stroke , and throwing it out behind him , in piles of castled fancy . At last we drove our tunnels in for we worked indeed for the lives of us , and all converging towards the middle , held our tools and listened . The other men heard nothing at all ; or declared that they heard nothing , being anxious now to abandon the matter , because of the chill in their feet and knees . But I said , '
163220	163278	163213	163213	myself	0	' and upon that they gripped their shovels , being more or less of Englishmen ; and the least drop of English blood is worth the best of any other when it comes to lasting out . But before we began again , I laid my head well into the chamber ; and there I hears a faint '
163285	163577	163213	163213	myself	0	' coming through some ells of snow , like a plaintive , buried hope , or a last appeal . I shouted aloud to cheer him up , for I knew what sheep it was , to wit , the most valiant of all the wethers , who had met me when I came home from London , and been so glad to see me . And then we all fell to again ; and very soon we hauled him out . Watch took charge of him at once , with an air of the noblest patronage , lying on his frozen fleece , and licking all his face and feet , to restore his warmth to him . Then fighting Tom jumped up at once , and made a little butt at Watch , as if nothing had ever ailed him , and then set off to a shallow place , and looked for something to nibble at . Further in , and close under the bank , where they had huddled themselves for warmth , we found all the rest of the poor sheep packed , as closely as if they were in a great pie . It was strange to observe how their vapour and breath , and the moisture exuding from their wool had scooped , as it were , a coved room for them , lined with a ribbing of deep yellow snow . Also the churned snow beneath their feet was as yellow as gamboge . Two or three of the weaklier hoggets were dead , from want of air , and from pressure ; but more than three - score were as lively as ever ; though cramped and stiff for a little while . '

163647	163668	163639	163639	You	274	' I replied , as we leaned on our shovels a moment , and the sheep came rubbing round us ; '
163694	165158	163686	163686	Watch	308	' Watch came , with his little scut of a tail cocked as sharp as duty , and I set him at the narrow mouth of the great snow antre . All the sheep sidled away , and got closer , that the other sheep might be bitten first , as the foolish things imagine ; whereas no good sheep - dog even so much as lips a sheep to turn it . Then of the outer sheep all now snowed and frizzled like a lawyer 's wig I took the two finest and heaviest , and with one beneath my right arm , and the other beneath my left , I went straight home to the upper sheppey , and set them inside and fastened them . Sixty and six I took home in that way , two at a time on each joumey ; and the work grew harder and harder each time , as the drifts of the snow were deepening . No other man should meddle with them ; I was resolved to try my strength against the strength of the elements ; and try it I did , ay , and proved it . A certain fierce delight burned in me , as the struggle grew harder ; but rather would I die than yield ; and at last I finished it . People talk of it to this day ; but none can tell what the labour was , who have not felt that snow and wind . Of the sheep upon the mountain , and the sheep upon the western farm , and the cattle on the upper barrows , scarcely one in ten was saved ; do what we would for them , and this was not through any neglect now that our wits were sharpened , but from the pure impossibility of finding them at all . That great snow never ceased a moment for three days and nights ; and then when all the earth was filled , and the topmost hedges were unseen , and the trees broke down with weight wherever the wind had not lightened them , a brilliant sun broke forth and showed the loss of all our customs . All our house was quite snowed up , except where we had purged a way , by dint of constant shovellings . The kitchen was as dark and darker than the cider - cellar , and long lines of furrowed scollops ran even up to the chimney - stacks . Several windows fell right inwards , through the weight of the snow against them ; and the few that stood , bulged in , and bent like an old bruised lanthorn . We were obliged to cook by candle - light ; we were forced to read by candle - light ; as for baking , we could not do it , because the oven was too chill ; and a load of faggots only brought a little wet down the sides of it . For when the sun burst forth at last upon that world of white , what he brought was neither warmth , nor cheer , nor hope of softening ; only a clearer shaft of cold , from the violet depths of sky . Long - drawn alleys of white haze seemed to lead towards him , yet such as he could not come down , with any warmth remaining . Broad white curtains of the frost - fog looped around the lower sky , on the verge of hill and valley , and above the laden trees . Only round the sun himself , and the spot of heaven he claimed , clustered a bright purple - blue , clear , and calm , and deep . That night such a frost ensued as we had never dreamed of , neither read in ancient books , or histories of Frobisher . The kettle by the fire froze , and the crock upon the hearth - cheeks ; many men were killed , and cattle rigid in their head - ropes . Then I heard that fearful sound , which never I had heard before , neither since have heard except during that same winter , the sharp yet solemn sound of trees burst open by the frost - blow . Our great walnut lost three branches , and has been dying ever since ; though growing meanwhile , as the soul does . And the ancient oak at the cross was rent , and many score of ash trees . But why should I tell all this ? the people who have not seen it as I have will only make faces , and disbelieve ; till such another frost comes ; which perhaps may never be . This terrible weather kept Tom Faggus from coming near our house for weeks ; at which indeed I was not vexed a quarter so much as Annie was ; for I had never half approved of him , as a husband for my sister ; in spite of his purchase from Squire Bassett , and the grant of the Royal pardon . It may be , however , that Annie took the same view of my love for Lorna , and could not augur well of it ; but if so , she held her peace , though I was not so sparing . For many things contributed to make me less good - humoured now than my real nature was ; and the very least of all these things would have been enough to make some people cross , and rude , and fractious . I mean the red and painful chapping of my face and hands , from working in the snow all day , and lying in the frost all night . For being of a fair complexion , and a ruddy nature , and pretty plump withal , and fed on plenty of hot victuals , and always forced by my mother to sit nearer the fire than I wished , it was wonderful to see how the cold ran revel on my cheeks and knuckles . And I feared that Lorna if it should ever please God to stop the snowing might take this for a proof of low and rustic blood and breeding . And this I say was the smallest thing ; for it was far more serious that we were losing half our stock , do all we would to shelter them . Even the horses in the stables mustered all together for the sake of breath and steaming had long icicles from their muzzles , almost every morning . But of all things the very gravest , to my apprehension , was the impossibility of hearing , or having any token of or from my loved one . Not that those three days alone of snow tremendous as it was could have blocked the country so ; but that the sky had never ceased , for more than two days at a time , for full three weeks thereafter , to pour fresh piles of fleecy mantle ; neither had the wind relaxed a single day from shaking them . As a rule , it snowed all day , cleared up at night , and froze intensely , with the stars as bright as jewels , earth spread out in lustrous twilight , and the sounds in the air as sharp and crackling as artillery ; then in the morning , snow again ; before the sun could come to help . It mattered not what way the wind was . Often and often the vanes went round , and we hoped for change of weather ; the only change was that it seemed if possible to grow colder . Indeed , after a week or so , the wind would regularly box the compass as the sailors call it in the course of every day , following where the sun should be , as if to make a mock of him . And this of course immensely added to the peril of the drifts ; because they shifted every day ; and no skill or care might learn them . I believe it was on Epiphany morning , or somewhere about that period , when Lizzie ran into the kitchen to me , where I was thawing my goose - grease , with the dogs among the ashes the live dogs , I mean , not the iron ones , for them we had given up long ago , and having caught me , by way of wonder for generally I was out shoveling long before my '

165197	165219	165191	165191	You	4648	' said my lady , as Annie and I used to call her , on account of her airs and graces ; '

165241	165251	165254	165254	I	0	' I answered , though pleased with her condescension ; '

165283	165290	165281	165281	John	274	' said Lizzie , looking grander ; '
165304	165305	165281	165281	John	274	' '
165308	165313	165281	165281	John	274	' I cried out ; '
165328	165415	165318	165318	clerk	1272	' Thereupon I was bent on my usual round a very small one nowadays , but Eliza took me with both hands , and I stopped of course ; for I could not bear to shake the child , even in play , for a moment , because her back was tender . Then she looked up at me with her beautiful eyes , so large , unhealthy and delicate , and strangely shadowing outward , as if to spread their meaning ; and she said , '
165476	165477	165456	165456	I	0	' '
165515	167307	165510	165510	mother	1006	' She looked a little disappointed , but she knew what I had to do ; and after all she was not so utterly unreasonable ; although she did read books . And when I had done my morning 's work , I listened to her patiently ; and it was out of my power to think that all she said was foolish . For I knew common sense pretty well , by this time , whether it happened to be my own , or any other person 's , if clearly laid before me . And Lizzie had a particular way of setting forth very clearly whatever she wished to express and enforce . But the queerest part of it all was this , that if she could but have dreamed for a moment what would be the first application made me by of her lesson , she would rather have bitten her tongue off than help me to my purpose . She told me that in the Arctic Regions , as they call some places , a long way north , where the Great Bear lies all across the heavens , and no sun is up , for whole months at a time , and yet where people will go exploring , out of pure contradiction , and for the sake of novelty , and love of being frozen that here they always had such winters as we were having now . It never ceased to freeze , she said ; and it never ceased to snow ; except when it was too cold ; and then all the air was choked with glittering spikes ; and a man 's skin might come off of him , before he could ask the reason . Nevertheless the people there although the snow was fifty feet deep , and all their breath fell behind them frozen , like a log of wood dropped from their shoulders , yet they managed to get along , and make the time of the year to each other , by a little cleverness . For seeing how the snow was spread , lightly over everything , covering up the hills and valleys , and the foreskin of the sea , they contrived a way to crown it , and to glide like a flake along . Through the sparkle of the whiteness , and the wreaths of windy tossings , and the ups and downs of cold , any man might get along with a boat on either foot , to prevent his sinking . She told me how these boats were made ; very strong and very light , of ribs with skin across them ; five feet long , and one foot wide ; and turned up at each end , even as a canoe is . But she did not tell me , nor did I give it a moment 's thought myself , how hard it was to walk upon them without early practice . Then she told me another thing equally useful to me ; although I would not let her see how much I thought about it . And this concerned the use of sledges , and their power of gliding , and the lightness of their following ; all of which I could see at once , through knowledge of our own farm - sleds ; which we employ in lieu of wheels , used in flatter districts . When I had heard all this from her , a mere chit of a girl as she was , unfit to make a snowball even , or to fry snow pancakes , I looked down on her with amazement , and began to wish a little that I had given more time to books . But God shapes all our fitness , and gives each man his meaning , even as he guides the wavering lines of snow descending . Our Eliza was meant for books ; our dear Annie for loving and cooking ; I , John Ridd , for sheep , and wrestling , and the thought of Lorna ; and mother to love all three of us , and to make the best of her children . And now , if I must tell the truth , as at every page I try to do though God knows it is hard enough , I had felt through all this weather , though my life was Lorna 's , something of a satisfaction in so doing duty to my kindest and best of mothers , and to none but her . For if you come to think of it a man 's young love is very pleasant , very sweet , and tickling ; and takes him through the core of heart ; without his knowing how or why . Then he dwells upon it sideways , without people looking , and builds up all sorts of fancies , growing hot with working so at his own imaginings . So his love is a crystal Goddess , set upon an obelisk ; and whoever will not bow the knee yet without glancing at her , the lover makes it a sacred rite either to kick or to stick him . I am not speaking of me and Lorna , but of common people . Then if you come to think again lo ! or I will not say lo ! for no one can behold it only feel , or but remember , what a real mother is . Ever loving , ever soft , ever turning sin to goodness , vices into virtues ; blind to all nine - tenths of wrong ; through a telescope beholding though herself so nigh to them faintest decimal of promise , even in her vilest child . Ready to thank God again , as when her babe was born to her ; leaping as at kingdom - come at a wandering syllable of Gospel for her lost one . All this our mother was to us , and even more than all of this ; and hence I felt a pride and joy in doing my sacred duty towards her , now that the weather compelled me . And she was as grateful and delighted as if she had no more claim upon me than a stranger 's sheep might have . Yet from time to time I groaned within myself and by myself , at thinking of my sad debarment from the sight of Lorna , and of all that might have happened to her , now she had no protection . Therefore , I fell to at once , upon that hint from Lizzie , and being used to thatching - work , and the making of traps , and so on , before very long I built myself a pair of strong and light snow - shoes , framed with ash and ribbed of withy , with half - tanned calf - skin stretched across , and an inner sole to support my feet . At first I could not walk at all , but floundered about most piteously , catching one shoe in the other , and both of them in the snow - drifts , to the great amusement of the girls , who were come to look at me . But after a while I grew more expert , discovering what my errors were , and altering the inclination of the shoes themselves , according to a print which Lizzie found in a book of adventures . And this made such a difference , that I crossed the farmyard and came back again though turning was the worst thing of all without so much as falling once , or getting my staff entangled . But oh , the aching of my ankles , when I went to bed that night ; I was forced to help myself upstairs with a couple of mopsticks ! and I rubbed the joints with neatsfoot oil , which comforted them greatly . And likely enough I would have abandoned any further trial , but for Lizzie 's ridicule , and pretended sympathy ; asking if the strong John Ridd would have old Betty to lean upon . Therefore I set to again , with a fixed resolve not to notice pain or stiffness , but to warm them out of me . And sure enough , before dark that day , I could get along pretty freely ; especially improving every time , after leaving off and resting . The astonishment of poor John Fry , Bill Dadds , and Jem Slocombe , when they saw me coming down the hill upon them , in the twilight , where they were clearing the furze rick and trussing it for cattle , was more than I can tell you ; because they did not let me see it , but ran away with one accord , and floundered into a snowdrift . They believed , and so did every one else especially when I grew able to glide along pretty rapidly , that I had stolen Mother Melldrum 's sieves , on which she was said to fly over the foreland at midnight every Saturday . Upon the following day , I held some council with my mother ; not liking to go without her permission , yet scarcely daring to ask for it . But here she disappointed me , on the right side of disappointment ; saying that she had seen my pining which she never could have done ; because I had been too hard at work , and rather than watch me grieving so , for somebody or other , who now was all in all to me , I might go upon my course , and God 's protection go with me ! At this I was amazed , because it was not at all like mother ; and knowing how well I had behaved , ever since the time of our snowing up , I was a little moved to tell her that she could not understand me . However my sense of duty kept me , and my knowledge of the catechism , from saying such a thing as that , or even thinking twice of it . And so I took her at her word , which she was not prepared for ; and telling her how proud I was of her trust in Providence , and how I could run in my new snow - shoes , I took a short pipe in my mouth , and started forth accordingly .

She leaped at it , as a starving dog leaps at sight of his supper , and she set her teeth in it , and then withheld it from her lips , with something very like an oath at her own vile greediness ; and then away round the corner with it , no doubt for her young mistress . I meanwhile was occupied , to the best of my ability , in taking my snow - shoes off , yet wondering much within myself why Lorna did not come to me . But presently I knew the cause , for Gwenny called me , and I ran , and found my darling quite unable to say so much as , '
168861	168927	168855	168855	John	261	' Between the hunger and the cold , and the excitement of my coming , she had fainted away , and lay back on a chair , as white as the snow around us . In betwixt her delicate lips , Gwenny was thrusting with all her strength the hard brown crust of the rye - bread , which she had snatched from me so . '
168935	168939	168855	168855	John	261	' I said ; '

169089	169146	169070	169070	I	0	' As I repelled this fearful thought in a manner highly fortifying , the tender hue flowed back again into her famished cheeks and lips , and a softer brilliance glistened from the depth of her dark eyes . She gave me one little shrunken hand , and I could not help a tear for it . '
169153	169170	169150	169151	Mistress Lorna	311	' I said , pretending to be gay , for a smile might do her good ; '
169188	169189	169181	169181	she	393	' '
169201	169206	169207	169207	you	1660	' Gwenny answered laughing ; '

Bless her heart , I have something here such as she never tasted the like of , being in such appetite . Look here , Lorna ; smell it first . I have had it ever since Twelfth Day , and kept it all the time for you . Annie made it . That is enough to warrant it good cooking . '
169684	169691	169693	169693	Lorna	311	' The meaning is sad enough , '
169695	169722	169693	169693	Lorna	311	' and I see no way out of it . We are both to be starved until I let them do what they like with me . '

169797	169921	169782	169782	she	311	' I told them that this state of things could be endured no longer , on which point they agreed with me , but saw no means to help it . For even if Lorna could make up her mind to come away with me and live at Plover 's Barrows farm , under my good mother 's care , as I had urged so often , behold the snow was all around us , heaped as high as mountains , and how could any delicate maiden ever get across it ? Then I spoke with a strange tingle upon both sides of my heart , knowing that this undertaking was a serious one for all , and might burn our farm down , '
169945	169946	169940	169940	you	4704	' '
169955	169970	169950	169950	I	0	' said my beauty , with a smile and a glance to follow it ; '

170011	170186	169997	169997	you	393	' cried Gwenny , in a voice that settled it . And so we began to arrange about it ; and I was much excited . It was useless now to leave it longer ; if it could be done at all , it could not be too quickly done . It was the Counsellor who had ordered , after all other schemes had failed , that his niece should have no food until she would obey him . He had strictly watched the house , taking turns with Carver , to ensure that none came nigh it bearing food or comfort . But this evening , they had thought it needless to remain on guard ; and it would have been impossible , because themselves were busy offering high festival to all the valley , in right of their own commandership . And Gwenny said that nothing made her so nearly mad with appetite as the account she received from a woman of all the dishes preparing . Nevertheless she had answered bravely , '
170221	170321	170197	170198	the Carver	4708	' And so in truth they did , although so little dreaming it ; for no Doone that was ever born , however much of a Carver , might vie with our Annie for mince - meat . Now while we sat reflecting much , and talking a good deal more , in spite of all the cold for I never was in a hurry to go , when I had Lorna with me she said , in her silvery voice , which always led me so along , as if I were a slave to a beautiful bell , '
170398	170399	170382	170382	you	261	' '
170403	170407	170382	170382	you	261	' I answered , '

170458	170469	170456	170456	John	261	' said Lorna , nestling for a moment to me ; '

170519	170520	170521	170521	I	0	' '
170584	170679	170579	170579	Gwenny	393	' Gwenny was famed for her imitation of the Counsellor making a speech ; and she began to shake her hair , and mount upon a footstool ; but I really could not have this , though even Lorna ordered it . The truth was that my darling maiden was in such wild spirits , at seeing me so unexpected , and at the prospect of release , and of what she had never known , quiet life and happiness , that like all warm and loving natures , she could scarce control herself . '
170790	171001	170775	170775	you	261	' All this she did so beautifully , with her lips put up like cherries , and her fingers bent half back , as only girls can bend them , and her little waist thrown out against the white of the snowed - up window , that I made her do it three times over ; and I stopped her every time and let it freeze again , that so she might be the longer . Now I knew that all her love was mine , every bit as much as mine was hers ; yet I must have her to show it , dwelling upon every proof , lengthening out all certainty . Perhaps the jealous heart is loath to own a life worth twice its own . Be that as it may , I know that we thawed the window nicely . And then I saw , far down the stream or rather down the bed of it , for there was no stream visible , a little form of fire arising , red , and dark , and flickering . Presently it caught on something , and went upward boldly ; and then it struck into many forks , and then it fell , and rose again . '
171012	171025	171003	171003	you	4717	' asked Lorna , smiling cleverly at the manner of my staring . '
171065	171066	171055	171055	they	3157	' '
171100	171101	171087	171088	The Doones	295	' '

171261	171649	171218	171218	they	9616	' Though Lorna took it so in joke , I looked upon it very gravely , knowing that this heavy outrage to the feelings of the neighbourhood would cause more stir than a hundred sheep stolen , or a score of houses sacked . Not of course that the beacon was of the smallest use to any one , neither stopped anybody from stealing , nay , rather it was like the parish knell , which begins when all is over , and depresses all the survivors ; yet I knew that we valued it , and were proud , and spoke of it as a mighty institution ; and even more than that , our vestry had voted , within the last two years , seven shillings and six - pence to pay for it , in proportion with other parishes . And one of the men who attended to it , or at least who was paid for doing so , was our Jem Slocombe 's grandfather . However , in spite of all my regrets , the fire went up very merrily , blazing red and white and yellow , as it leaped on different things . And the light danced on the snow - drifts with a misty lilac hue . I was astonished at its burning in such mighty depths of snow ; but Gwenny said that the wicked men had been three days hard at work , clearing , as it were , a cock - pit , for their fire to have its way . And now they had a mighty pile , which must have covered five land - yards square , heaped up to a goodly height , and eager to take fire . In this I saw great obstacle to what I wished to manage . For when this pyramid should be kindled thoroughly , and pouring light and blazes round , would not all the valley be like a white room full of candles ? Thinking thus , I was half inclined to abide my time for another night : and then my second thoughts convinced me that I would be a fool in this . For lo , what an opportunity ! All the Doones would be drunk , of course , in about three hours '
171796	171802	171805	171805	I	0	' Sweetest , in two hours '
171898	171944	171879	171879	I	0	' With this I folded her in my arms ; and she looked frightened at me ; not having perceived her danger ; and then I told Gwenny over again what I had told her mistress : but she only nodded her head and said , '

173009	173080	172980	172980	Annie	324	' Oh , John , here is the most wonderful thing ! Mother has never shown it before ; and I ca n't think how she could make up her mind . She had gotten it in a great well of a cupboard , with camphor , and spirits , and lavender . Lizzie says it is a most magnificent sealskin cloak , worth fifty pounds , or a farthing . '
173081	173091	173093	173093	I	0	' At any rate it is soft and warm , '
173106	173118	172980	172980	Annie	324	' Tell mother I will put it over Lorna 's feet . '
173119	173130	173132	173132	Annie	324	' Lorna 's feet ! Oh , you great fool , '
173141	173155	173132	173132	Annie	324	' over her shoulders ; and be proud , you very stupid John . '
173156	173166	173167	173167	I	0	' It is not good enough for her feet , '
173174	173192	173167	173167	I	0	' but do n't tell mother I said so , Annie . Only thank her very kindly . '
174910	175232	174897	174897	My	0	' bonfire , with wondering both what Lorna would think of our farm - yard , and what my mother would think of her . Upon the former subject my anxiety was wasted , for Lorna neither saw a thing , nor even opened her heavy eyes . And as to what mother would think of her , she was certain not to think at all , until she had cried over her . And so indeed it came to pass . Even at this length of time , I can hardly tell it , although so bright before my mind , because it moves my heart so . The sledd was at the open door , with only Lorna in it ; for Gwenny Carfax had jumped out , and hung back in the clearing , giving any reason rather than the only true one that she would not be intruding . At the door were all our people ; first , of course , Betty Muxworthy , teaching me how to draw the sledd , as if she had been born in it , and flourishing with a great broom , wherever a speck of snow lay . Then dear Annie , and old Molly who was very quiet , and counted almost for nobody , and behind them , mother , looking as if she wanted to come first , but doubted how the manners lay . In the distance Lizzie stood , fearful of encouraging , but unable to keep out of it . Betty was going to poke her broom right in under the sealskin cloak , where Lorna lay unconscious , and where her precious breath hung frozen , like a silver cobweb ; but I caught up Betty 's broom , and flung it clean away over the corn chamber ; and then I put the others by , and fetched my mother forward . '
175239	175243	175233	175233	You	4831	' I said : '
175257	175301	175255	175255	Annie	328	' Dear mother 's hands were quick and trembling , as she opened the shining folds ; and there she saw my Lorna sleeping , with her black hair all dishevelled , and she bent and kissed her forehead , and only said , '
175308	175326	175306	175306	John	261	' And then she was taken with violent weeping , and I was forced to hold her . '
175337	175346	175347	175347	Annie	328	' said Betty in her most jealous way ; '
175396	175882	175391	175391	her	4832	' With this , they carried her into the house , Betty chattering all the while , and going on now about Lorna 's hands , and the others crowding round her , so that I thought I was not wanted among so many women , and should only get the worst of it , and perhaps do harm to my darling . Therefore I went and brought Gwenny in , and gave her a potful of bacon and peas , and an iron spoon to eat it with , which she did right heartily . Then I asked her how she could have been such a fool as to let those two vile fellows enter the house where Lorna was ; and she accounted for it so naturally , that I could only blame myself . For my agreement had been to give one loud knock if you happen to remember and after that two little knocks . Well these two drunken rogues had come ; and one , being very drunk indeed , had given a great thump ; and then nothing more to do with it ; and the other , being three - quarters drunk , had followed his leader as one might say but feebly , and making two of it . Whereupon up jumped Lorna , and declared that her John was there . All this Gwenny told me shortly , between the whiles of eating , and even while she licked the spoon ; and then there came a message for me that my love was sensible , and was seeking all around for me . Then I told Gwenny to hold her tongue whatever she did among us , and not to trust to women 's words ; and she told me they all were liars , as she had found out long ago ; and the only thing to believe in was an honest man , when found . Thereupon I could have kissed her as a sort of tribute , liking to be appreciated ; yet the peas upon her lips made me think about it ; and thought is fatal to action . So I went to see my dear . That sight I shall not forget ; till my dying head falls back , and my breast can lift no more . I know not whether I were then more blessed , or harrowed by it . For in the settle was my Lorna , propped with pillows round her , and her clear hands spread sometimes to the blazing fireplace . In her eyes no knowledge was of anything around her , neither in her neck the sense of leaning towards anything . Only both her lovely hands were entreating something , to spare her , or to love her ; and the lines of supplication quivered in her sad white face . '
175891	175921	175888	175889	my mother	683	' I said very quietly , but so that I would be obeyed ; and everybody knew it . Then mother came to me alone ; and she said , '
175938	175939	175940	175940	Mother	299	' '
175948	175957	175942	175942	I	0	' was all that I could answer her ; '
175971	176246	175942	175942	I	0	' For I felt that Lorna knew me , and no other soul but me ; and that if not interfered with , she would soon come home to me . Therefore I sat gently by her , leaving nature , as it were , to her own good time and will . And presently the glance that watched me , as at distance and in doubt , began to flutter and to brighten , and to deepen into kindness , then to beam with trust and love , and then with gathering tears to falter , and in shame to turn away . But the small entreating hands found their way , as if by instinct , to my great projecting palms ; and trembled there , and rested there . For a little while we lingered thus , neither wishing to move away , neither caring to look beyond the presence of the other ; both alike so full of hope , and comfort , and true happiness ; if only the world would let us be . And then a little sob disturbed us , and mother tried to make believe that she was only coughing . But Lorna , guessing who she was , jumped up so very rashly that she almost set her frock on fire from the great ash log ; and away she ran to the old oak chair , where mother was by the clock - case pretending to be knitting , and she took the work from mother 's hands , and laid them both upon her head , kneeling humbly , and looking up . '
176255	176270	175942	175942	I	0	' said mother , bending nearer , and then as Lorna 's gaze prevailed , '
176279	176318	175942	175942	I	0	' And so she went to mother 's heart by the very nearest road , even as she had come to mine ; I mean the road of pity , smoothed by grace , and youth , and gentleness .
177440	177442	177435	177435	she	311	' peart '
177678	177702	177630	177631	my Lorna	2129	' sake , because she was our visitor ; and I might have it before breakfast , or else when I came to say '
177707	177888	177630	177631	my Lorna	2129	' according as I decided . And I decided every night , not to take it in the morning , but put it off till the evening time , and have the pleasure to think about , through all the day of working . But when my darling came up to me in the early daylight , fresher than the daystar , and with no one looking ; only her bright eyes smiling , and sweet lips quite ready , was it likely I could wait , and think all day about it ? For she wore a frock of Annie 's , nicely made to fit her , taken in at the waist and curved I never could explain it , not being a mantua - maker ; but I know how her figure looked in it , and how it came towards me . But this is neither here nor there ; and I must on with my story . Those days are very sacred to me , and if I speak lightly of them , trust me , '
179638	179651	179652	179652	she	311	' Oh , the dear things , oh , the dear things ! '
179657	179682	179652	179652	she	311	' how wonderfully clever they are ! Only look at that one with his foot up , giving orders to the others , John ! '
179683	179695	179696	179696	I	0	' And I must give orders to you , my darling , '
179709	179738	179652	179652	she	311	' and that is , that you come in at once , with that worrisome cough of yours ; and sit by the fire , and warm yourself . '
179739	179807	179652	179652	she	311	' Oh , no , John ! Not for a minute , if you please , good John . I want to see the snow go away , and the green meadows coming forth . And here comes our favourite robin , who has lived in the oven so long , and sang us a song every morning . I must see what he thinks of it ! '
179808	179817	179818	179818	I	0	' You will do nothing of the sort , '
180147	180150	180152	180152	we	4936	' shoot , '
181280	181283	181276	181276	we	4970	' mucksy , '
183265	184293	184296	184296	you	5049	' dishonesty ; moreover , she said that it would seem a most foolish air on her part , and one which would cause the greatest pain to Annie , who had been so good to her , if she should refuse to sit at table with a man who held the King 's pardon , and was now a pattern of honesty . Against this I had not a word to say ; and could not help acknowledging in my heart that she was right , as well as wise , in her decision . And afterwards I discovered that mother would have been much displeased , if she had decided otherwise . Accordingly she turned away , with one of her very sweetest smiles whose beauty none can describe saying that she must not meet a man of such fashion and renown , in her common gardening frock ; but must try to look as nice as she could , if only in honour of dear Annie . And truth to tell , when she came to dinner , everything about her was the neatest and prettiest that can possibly be imagined . She contrived to match the colours so , to suit one another and her own , and yet with a certain delicate harmony of contrast , and the shape of everything was so nice , so that when she came into the room , with a crown of winning modesty upon the consciousness of beauty , I was quite as proud as if the Queen of England entered . My mother could not help remarking , though she knew that it was not mannerly , how like a princess Lorna looked , now she had her best things on ; but two things caught Squire Faggus 's eyes , after he had made a most gallant bow , and received a most graceful courtesy ; and he kept his bright bold gaze upon them , first on one , and then on the other , until my darling was hot with blushes , and I was ready to knock him down if he had not been our visitor . But here again I should have been wrong , as I was apt to be in those days ; for Tom intended no harm whatever , and his gaze was of pure curiosity ; though Annie herself was vexed with it . The two objects of his close regard , were first , and most worthily , Lorna 's face , and secondly , the ancient necklace restored to her by Sir Ensor Doone . Now wishing to save my darling 's comfort , and to keep things quiet , I shouted out that dinner was ready , so that half the parish could hear me ; upon which my mother laughed , and chid me , and despatched her guests before her . And a very good dinner we made , I remember , and a very happy one ; attending to the women first , as now is the manner of eating ; except among the workmen . With them , of course , it is needful that the man who has his hours fixed should be served first , and make the utmost of his time for feeding , while the women may go on , as much as ever they please , afterwards . But with us , who are not bound to time , there is no such reason to be quoted ; and the women being the weaker vessels , should be the first to begin to fill . And so we always arranged it . Now , though our Annie was a graceful maid , and Lizzie a very learned one , you should have seen how differently Lorna managed her dining ; she never took more than about a quarter of a mouthful at a time , and she never appeared to be chewing that , although she must have done so . Indeed , she appeared to dine as if it were a matter of no consequence , and as if she could think of other things more than of her business . All this , and her own manner of eating , I described to Eliza once , when I wanted to vex her for something very spiteful that she had said ; and I never succeeded so well before , for the girl was quite outrageous , having her own perception of it , which made my observation ten times as bitter to her . And I am not sure but what she ceased to like poor Lorna from that day ; and if so , I was quite paid out , as I well deserved , for my bit of satire . For it strikes me that of all human dealings , satire is the very lowest , and most mean and common . It is the equivalent in words of what bullying is in deeds ; and no more bespeaks a clever man , than the other does a brave one . These two wretched tricks exalt a fool in his own low esteem , but never in his neighbour 's ; for the deep common sense of our nature tells that no man of a genial heart , or of any spread of mind , can take pride in either . And though a good man may commit the one fault or the other , now and then , by way of outlet , he is sure to have compunctions soon , and to scorn himself more than the sufferer . Now when the young maidens were gone for we had quite a high dinner of fashion that day , with Betty Muxworthy waiting , and Gwenny Carfax at the gravy and only mother , and Tom , and I remained at the white deal table , with brandy , and schnapps , and hot water jugs ; Squire Faggus said quite suddenly , and perhaps on purpose to take us aback , in case of our hiding anything , '
184309	184310	184302	184304	that beautiful maiden	5050	' '
184320	184331	184302	184304	that beautiful maiden	5050	' mother answered , with a soft smile at me ; '
184353	184354	184363	184363	mother	1006	' '
184365	184371	184363	184363	mother	1006	' I replied rather sadly ; '
184387	184388	184372	184372	you	0	' '
184419	184545	184372	184372	you	0	' To this I made no answer , for fear of going beyond the truth , or else of making mischief . Not that I had , or wished to have , any mystery with mother ; neither was there in purest truth , any mystery in the matter ; to the utmost of my knowledge . And the only things that I had kept back , solely for mother 's comfort , were the death of poor Lord Alan Brandir if indeed he were dead and the connection of Marwood de Whichehalse with the dealings of the Doones , and the threats of Carver Doone against my own prosperity ; and , may be , one or two little things harrowing more than edifying . '
184550	184559	184560	184560	you	0	' said Master Faggus , smiling very pleasantly , '
184590	184950	184951	184951	Bravo	505	' And with that he sighed , in the tone which always overcame mother upon that subject , and had something to do with his getting Annie ; and then he produced his pretty box , full of rolled tobacco , and offered me one , as I now had joined the goodly company of smokers . So I took it , and watched what he did with his own , lest I might go wrong about mine . But when our cylinders were both lighted , and I enjoying mine wonderfully , and astonishing mother by my skill , Tom Faggus told us that he was sure he had seen my Lorna 's face before , many and many years ago , when she was quite a little child , but he could not remember where it was , or anything more about it at present ; though he would try to do so afterwards . He could not be mistaken , he said , for he had noticed her eyes especially ; and had never seen such eyes before , neither again , until this day . I asked him if he had ever ventured into the Doone - valley ; but he shook his head , and replied that he valued his life a deal too much for that . Then we put it to him , whether anything might assist his memory ; but he said that he knew not of aught to do so , unless it were another glass of schnapps . This being provided , he grew very wise , and told us clearly and candidly that we were both very foolish . For he said that we were keeping Lorna , at the risk not only of our stock , and the house above our heads , but also of our precious lives ; and after all was she worth it , although so very beautiful ? Upon which I told him , with indignation , that her beauty was the least part of her goodness , and that I would thank him for his opinion when I had requested it . '
184957	184961	184962	184962	fools	2055	' he answered ; '
185017	185018	185019	185019	She	5062	' '
185027	185031	185025	185025	herself	5062	' said I , '
185060	185094	185054	185054	I	0	' and here I stopped , for mother was looking , and I never would tell her how much it had cost me ; though she had tried fifty times to find out . '
185100	185112	185054	185054	I	0	' Tom Faggus cried , with a contempt that moved me : '
185162	185163	185127	185127	you	0	' '
185166	185170	185127	185127	you	0	' said I , '

185212	185228	185229	185229	you	0	' cried mother , now flushing as red as Tom 's own cheeks with excitement , '
185244	185256	185257	185259	the young mistress	5069	' I was greatly pleased with my mother , for calling Lorna '
185260	185411	185257	185259	the young mistress	5069	' ; it was not done for the sake of her diamonds , whether they were glass or not ; but because she felt as I had done , that Tom Faggus , a man of no birth whatever , was speaking beyond his mark , in calling a lady like Lorna a helpless child ; as well as in his general tone , which displayed no deference . He might have been used to the quality , in the way of stopping their coaches , or roystering at hotels with them ; but he never had met a high lady before , in equality , and upon virtue ; and we both felt that he ought to have known it , and to have thanked us for the opportunity , in a word , to have behaved a great deal more humbly than he had even tried to do . '
185415	185428	185413	185413	me	0	' answered Tom , in his loftiest manner , which Annie said was '
185432	185441	185443	185443	me	0	' but which seemed to me rather flashy , '
185517	185518	185519	185520	Master Faggus	272	' '
185522	185554	185519	185520	Master Faggus	272	' began my mother , with a manner of some dignity , such as she could sometimes use , by right of her integrity , and thorough kindness to every one , '
185580	185599	185604	185605	Master Faggus	272	' but here she stopped , because the spirits were her own , and Tom was our visitor , '
185679	185698	185700	185700	I	0	' here mother gave me a mighty squeeze , to be sure that she would have me at least '
185717	185820	185709	185715	a man who yearns for the highway	5080	' Having made this very long speech for her , mother came home upon my shoulder , and wept so that but for heeding her I would have taken Tom by the nose , and thrown him , and Winnie after him , over our farm - yard gate . For I am violent when roused ; and freely hereby acknowledge it ; though even my enemies will own that it takes a great deal to rouse me . But I do consider the grief and tears when justly caused of my dearest friends , to be a great deal to rouse me .

186963	187003	186845	186845	I	0	' Oh , no ! I never had so much money as that in all my life . It is very bright , and very pretty ; but it can not be worth five pounds , I am sure . '

187028	187065	186810	186810	she	311	' But , sir , I would not sell it to you , not for twenty times five pounds . My grandfather was so kind about it ; and I think it belonged to my mother . '

Three great Doones galloping after me , and a good job for me that they were so big , or they must have overtaken me . Just go and see to my horse , John , that 's an excellent lad .

190799	190887	190700	190700	Annie	324	' No , Mistress Lizzie ; we do not wear things of that kind nowadays . You are apt , I perceive , at romances . But I happened to have a little flat bottle of the best stoneware slung beneath my saddle - cloak , and filled with the very best eau de vie , from the George Hotel , at Southmolton . The brand of it now is upon my back . Oh , the murderous scoundrels , what a brave spirit they have spilled ! '

198035	198163	198165	198165	you	5443	' order , as the villains came swaggering down in the moonlight ready for rape or murder . Two of them fell , and the rest hung back , to think at their leisure what this was . They were not used to this sort of thing : it was neither just nor courteous . Being unable any longer to contain myself , as I thought of Lorna 's excitement at all this noise of firing , I came across the yard , expecting whether they would shoot at me . However , no one shot at me ; and I went up to Carver Doone , whom I knew by his size in the moonlight , and I took him by the beard , and said , '
198171	198233	198165	198165	you	5443	' For a moment he was so astonished that he could not answer . None had ever dared , I suppose , to look at him in that way ; and he saw that he had met his equal , or perhaps his master . And then he tried a pistol at me , but I was too quick for him . '
198242	198251	198252	198252	you	260	' I said to him , very soberly ; '
198292	199175	198281	198283	a despicable villain	5446	' And with that word , I laid him flat upon his back in our straw - yard , by a trick of the inner heel , which he could not have resisted though his strength had been twice as great as mine , unless he were a wrestler . Seeing him down the others ran , though one of them made a shot at me , and some of them got their horses , before our men came up ; and some went away without them . And among these last was Captain Carver who arose , while I was feeling myself for I had a little wound , and strode away with a train of curses enough to poison the light of the moon . We gained six very good horses , by this attempted rapine , as well as two young prisoners , whom I had smitten by the clover - rick . And two dead Doones were left behind , whom as we buried them in the churchyard , without any service over them , I for my part was most thankful that I had not killed . For to have the life of a fellow - man laid upon one 's conscience deserved he his death , or deserved it not is to my sense of right and wrong the heaviest of all burdens ; and the one that wears most deeply inwards , with the dwelling of the mind on this view and on that of it . I was inclined to pursue the enemy and try to capture more of them ; but Jeremy Stickles would not allow it , for he said that all the advantage would be upon their side , if we went hurrying after them , with only the moon to guide us . And who could tell but what there might be another band of them , ready to fall upon the house , and burn it , and seize the women , if we left them unprotected ? When he put the case thus , I was glad enough to abide by his decision . And one thing was quite certain , that the Doones had never before received so rude a shock , and so violent a blow to their supremacy , since first they had built up their power , and become the Lords of Exmoor . I knew that Carver Doone would gnash those mighty teeth of his , and curse the men around him , for the blunder which was in truth his own of over - confidence and carelessness . And at the same time , all the rest would feel that such a thing had never happened , while old Sir Ensor was alive ; and that it was caused by nothing short of gross mismanagement . I scarcely know who made the greatest fuss about my little wound , mother , or Annie , or Lorna . I was heartily ashamed to be so treated like a milksop ; but most unluckily it had been impossible to hide it . For the ball had cut along my temple , just above the eyebrow ; and being fired so near at hand , the powder too had scarred me . Therefore it seemed a great deal worse than it really was ; and the sponging , and the plastering , and the sobbing , and the moaning , made me quite ashamed to look Master Stickles in the face . However , at last I persuaded them that I had no intention of giving up the ghost that night ; and then they all fell to , and thanked God with an emphasis quite unknown in church . And hereupon Master Stickles said , in his free and easy manner for no one courted his observation , that I was the luckiest of all mortals in having a mother , and a sister , and a sweetheart , to make much of me . For his part , he said , he was just as well off in not having any to care for him . For now he might go and get shot , or stabbed , or knocked on the head , at his pleasure , without any one being offended . I made bold , upon this , to ask him what was become of his wife ; for I had heard him speak of having one . He said that he neither knew nor cared ; and perhaps I should be like him some day . That Lorna should hear such sentiments was very grievous to me . But she looked at me with a smile , which proved her contempt for all such ideas ; and lest anything still more unfit might be said , I dismissed the question . But Master Stickles told me afterwards , when there was no one with us , to have no faith in any woman , whatever she might seem to be . For he assured me that now he possessed very large experience , for so small a matter ; being thoroughly acquainted with women of every class , from ladies of the highest blood , to Bonarobas , and peasants '
199453	199472	199448	199448	I	0	' You have been ill - treated , perhaps , Master Stickles , by some woman or other ? '
199473	199480	199481	199481	he	405	' Ah , that have I , '
199487	199648	199481	199481	he	405	' and the last on earth who should serve me so , the woman who was my wife . A woman whom I never struck , never wronged in any way , never even let her know that I like another better . And yet when I was at Berwick last , with the regiment on guard there against those vile moss - troopers , what does that woman do but fly in the face of all authority , and of my especial business , by running away herself with the biggest of all moss - troopers ? Not that I cared a groat about her ; and I wish the fool well rid of her : but the insolence of the thing was such that everybody laughed at me ; and back I went to London , losing a far better and safer job than this ; and all through her . Come , let 's have another onion . '
199767	199773	199782	199782	Stickles	405	' captus in flagrante delicto , '
199837	199841	199842	199842	He	405	' Not so . '

" And although it was too true that we had lost a many cattle , yet even so we had not lost money ; for the few remaining fetched such prices as were never known before . And though we grumbled with all our hearts , and really believed , at one time , that starvation was upon us , I doubt whether , on the whole , we were not the fatter , and the richer , and the wiser for that winter . And I might have said the happier , except for the sorrow which we felt at the failures among our neighbours . The Snowes lost every sheep they had , and nine out of ten horned cattle ; and poor Jasper Kebby would have been forced to throw up the lease of his farm , and perhaps to go to prison , but for the help we gave him . However , my dear mother would have it that Lorna was too young , as yet , to think of being married : and indeed I myself was compelled to admit that her form was becoming more perfect and lovely ; though I had not thought it possible . And another difficulty was , that as we had all been Protestants from the time of Queen Elizabeth , the maiden must be converted first , and taught to hate all Papists . Now Lorna had not the smallest idea of ever being converted . She said that she loved me truly , but wanted not to convert me ; and if I loved her equally , why should I wish to convert her ? With this I was tolerably content , not seeing so very much difference between a creed and a credo , and believing God to be our Father , in Latin as well as English . Moreover , my darling knew but little of the Popish ways whether excellent or otherwise inasmuch as the Doones , though they stole their houses , or at least the joiner 's work , had never been tempted enough by the devil to steal either church or chapel . Lorna came to our little church , when Parson Bowden reappeared after the snow was over ; and she said that all was very nice , and very like what she had seen in the time of her Aunt Sabina , when they went far away to the little chapel , with a shilling in their gloves . It made the tears come into her eyes , by the force of memory , when Parson Bowden did the things , not so gracefully nor so well , yet with pleasant imitation of her old Priest 's sacred rites . '
200958	200979	200952	200952	He	5495	' she said , being used to talk in the service time , and my mother was obliged to cough : '
201004	201651	200990	200990	he	5495	' Everybody in our parish , who could walk at all , or hire a boy and a wheelbarrow , ay , and half the folk from Countisbury , Brendon , and even Lynmouth , was and were to be found that Sunday , in our little church of Oare . People who would not come anigh us , when the Doones were threatening with carbine and with fire - brand , flocked in their very best clothes , to see a lady Doone go to church . Now all this came of that vile John Fry ; I knew it as well as possible ; his tongue was worse than the clacker of a charity - school bell , or the ladle in the frying - pan , when the bees are swarming . However , Lorna was not troubled ; partly because of her natural dignity and gentleness ; partly because she never dreamed that the people were come to look at her . But when we came to the Psalms of the day , with some vague sense of being stared at more than ought to be , she dropped the heavy black lace fringing of the velvet hat she wore , and concealed from the congregation all except her bright red lips , and the oval snowdrift of her chin . I touched her hand , and she pressed mine ; and we felt that we were close together , and God saw no harm in it . As for Parson Bowden as worthy a man as ever lived , and one who could shoot flying , he scarcely knew what he was doing , without the clerk to help him . He had borne it very well indeed , when I returned from London ; but to see a live Doone in his church , and a lady Doone , and a lovely Doone , moreover one engaged to me , upon whom he almost looked as the Squire of his parish although not rightly an Armiger , and to feel that this lovely Doone was a Papist , and therefore of higher religion as all our parsons think and that she knew exactly how he ought to do all the service , of which he himself knew little ; I wish to express my firm belief that all these things together turned Parson Bowden 's head a little , and made him look to me for orders . My mother , the very best of women , was as I could well perceive a little annoyed and vexed with things . For this particular occasion , she had procured from Dulverton , by special message to Ruth Huckaback whereof more anon , a head - dress with a feather never seen before upon Exmoor , to the best of every one 's knowledge . It came from a bird called a flaming something a flaming oh , or a flaming ah , I will not be positive but I can assure you that it did flame ; and dear mother had no other thought , but that all the congregation would neither see nor think of any other mortal thing , or immortal even , to the very end of the sermon . Herein she was so disappointed , that no sooner did she get home , but upstairs she went at speed , not even stopping at the mirror in our little parlour , and flung the whole thing into a cupboard , as I knew by the bang of the door , having eased the lock for her lately . Lorna saw there was something wrong ; and she looked at Annie and Lizzie as more likely to understand it with her former timid glance ; which I knew so well , and which had first enslaved me . '

201908	202123	201900	201900	your	5506	' My angel did come , with a sigh , and then with a smile , when we were alone ; but without any unangelic attempt at snapping her sweet white fingers . These little things are enough to show that while every one so admired Lorna , and so kindly took to her , still there would , just now and then , be petty and paltry flashes of jealousy concerning her ; and perhaps it could not be otherwise among so many women . However , we were always doubly kind to her afterwards ; and although her mind was so sensitive and quick that she must have suffered , she never allowed us to perceive it , nor lowered herself by resenting it . Possibly I may have mentioned that little Ruth Huckaback had been asked , and had even promised to spend her Christmas with us ; and this was the more desirable , because she had left us through some offence , or sorrow , about things said of her . Now my dear mother , being the kindest and best - hearted of all women , could not bear that poor dear Ruth who would some day have such a fortune , should be entirely lost to us . '
202133	202142	201900	201900	your	5506	' she said more than once about it , '
202272	202594	202595	202595	Tush	514	' Now one of the little ways in which Ruth had been very useful , was the purchase of the scarlet feathers of the flaming bird ; and now that the house was quite safe from attack , and the mark on my forehead was healing , I was begged , over and over again , to go and see Ruth , and make all things straight , and pay for the gorgeous plumage . This last I was very desirous to do , that I might know the price of it , having made a small bet on the subject with Annie ; and having held counsel with myself , whether or not it were possible to get something of the kind for Lorna , of still more distinguished appearance . Of course she could not wear scarlet as yet , even if I had wished it ; but I believed that people of fashion often wore purple for mourning ; purple too was the royal colour , and Lorna was by right a queen ; therefore I was quite resolved to ransack Uncle Reuben 's stores , in search of some bright purple bird , if nature had kindly provided one . All this , however , I kept to myself , intending to trust Ruth Huckaback , and no one else in the matter . And so , one beautiful spring morning , when all the earth was kissed with scent , and all the air caressed with song , up the lane I stoutly rode , well armed , and well provided . Now though it is part of my life to heed , it is no part of my tale to tell , how the wheat was coming on . I reckon that you , who read this story , after I am dead and gone and before that none shall read it , will say , '
202623	203240	203241	203241	I	0	' This may be very good argument , and in the main , I believe that it is so . Nevertheless , if a man is to tell only what he thought and did , and not what came around him , he must not mention his own clothes , which his father and mother bought for him . And more than my own clothes to me , ay , and as much as my own skin , are the works of nature round about , whereof a man is the smallest . And now I will tell you , although most likely only to be laughed at , because I can not put it in the style of Mr. Dryden whom to compare to Shakespeare ! but if once I begin upon that , you will never hear the last of me nevertheless , I will tell you this ; not wishing to be rude , but only just because I know it ; the more a man can fling his arms so to say round Nature 's neck , the more he can upon her bosom , like an infant , lie and suck , the more that man shall earn the trust and love of all his fellow men . In this matter is no jealousy when the man is dead ; because thereafter all others know how much of the milk be had ; and he can suck no longer ; and they value him accordingly , for the nourishment he is to them . Even as when we keep a roaster of the sucking - pigs , we choose , and praise at table most , the favourite of its mother . Fifty times have I seen this , and smiled , and praised our people 's taste , and offered them more of the vitals . Now here am I upon Shakespeare who died , of his own fruition , at the age of fifty - two , yet lived more than fifty thousand men , within his little span of life , when all the while I ought to be riding as hard as I can to Dulverton . But , to tell the truth , I could not ride hard , being held at every turn , and often without any turn at all , by the beauty of things around me . These things grow upon a man if once he stops to notice them . It wanted yet two hours to noon , when I came to Master Huckaback 's door , and struck the panels smartly . Knowing nothing of their manners , only that people in a town could not be expected to entertain as we do in farm - houses , having , moreover , keen expectation of Master Huckaback 's avarice , I had brought some stuff to eat , made by Annie , and packed by Lorna , and requiring no thinking about it . Ruth herself came and let me in , blushing very heartily ; for which colour I praised her health , and my praises heightened it . That little thing had lovely eyes , and could be trusted thoroughly . I do like an obstinate little woman , when she is sure that she is right . And indeed if love had never sped me straight to the heart of Lorna compared to whom , Ruth was no more than the thief is to the candle , who knows but what I might have yielded to the law of nature , that thorough trimmer of balances , and verified the proverb that the giant loves the dwarf ? '
203263	203880	203241	203241	I	0	' And therewith I bussed her well , and put my arm around her waist , being so terribly restricted in the matter of Lorna , and knowing the use of practice . Not that I had any warmth all that was darling Lorna 's only out of pure gallantry , and my knowledge of London fashions . Ruth blushed to such a pitch at this , and looked up at me with such a gleam ; as if I must have my own way ; that all my love of kissing sunk , and I felt that I was wronging her . Only my mother had told me , when the girls were out of the way , to do all I could to please darling Ruth , and I had gone about it accordingly . Now Ruth as yet had never heard a word about dear Lorna ; and when she led me into the kitchen where everything looked beautiful , and told me not to mind , for a moment , about the scrubbing of my boots , because she would only be too glad to clean it all up after me , and told me how glad she was to see me , blushing more at every word , and recalling some of them , and stooping down for pots and pans , when I looked at her too ruddily all these things came upon me so , without any legal notice , that I could only look at Ruth , and think how very good she was , and how bright her handles were ; and wonder if I had wronged her . Once or twice , I began this I say upon my honour to endeavour to explain exactly , how we were at Plover 's Barrows ; how we all had been bound to fight , and had defeated the enemy , keeping their queen amongst us . But Ruth would make some great mistake between Lorna and Gwenny Carfax , and gave me no chance to set her aright , and cared about nothing much , except some news of Sally Snowe . What could I do with this little thing ? All my sense of modesty , and value for my dinner , were against my over - pressing all the graceful hints I had given about Lorna . Ruth was just a girl of that sort , who will not believe one word , except from her own seeing ; not so much from any doubt , as from the practice of using eyes which have been in business . I asked Cousin Ruth as we used to call her , though the cousinship was distant what was become of Uncle Ben , and how it was that we never heard anything of or from him now . She replied that she hardly knew what to make of her grandfather 's manner of carrying on , for the last half - year or more . He was apt to leave his home , she said , at any hour of the day or night ; going none knew whither , and returning no one might say when . And his dress , in her opinion , was enough to frighten a hodman , of a scavenger of the roads , instead of the decent suit of kersey , or of Sabbath doeskins , such as had won the respect and reverence of his fellow - townsmen . But the worst of all things was , as she confessed with tears in her eyes , that the poor old gentleman had something weighing heavily on his mind . '
203890	203903	203887	203888	Cousin Ridd	335	' she said , for she never would call me Cousin John ; '

What I had always liked in Ruth , was the calm , straightforward gaze , and beauty of her large brown eyes . Indeed I had spoken of them to Lorna , as the only ones to be compared though not for more than a moment to her own , for truth and light , but never for depth and softness . But now the little maiden dropped them , and turned away , without reply . '

Therefore we had none to dine with us , except the foreman of the shop , a worthy man , named Thomas Cockram , fifty years of age or so . He seemed to me to have strong intentions of his own about little Ruth , and on that account to regard me with a wholly undue malevolence . And perhaps , in order to justify him , I may have been more attentive to her than otherwise need have been ; at any rate , Ruth and I were pleasant ; and he the very opposite . '
204637	204660	204635	204635	Ruth	348	' I said , on purpose to vex Master Cockram , because he eyed us so heavily , and squinted to unluckily , '

Now , Master Cockram , you ought to come as far as our good farm , at once , and eat two new - laid eggs for breakfast , and be made to look quite young again . Our good Annie would cook for you ; and you should have the hot new milk and the pope 's eye from the mutton ; and every foot of you would become a yard in about a fortnight . '

All the keys are in my keeping , and dear grandfather has the finest wine , not to be matched in the west of England , as I have heard good judges say ; though I know not wine from cider . Do you like the wine of Oporto , or the wine of Xeres ? '

You are all so dreadfully hospitable . Now not another " no , " Cousin Ridd . We must have another bottle . '

And for my part , she is welcome to him . I have never been one of those who dwell upon distinctions of rank , and birth , and such like ; as if they were in the heart of nature , and must be eternal . In early youth , I may have thought so , and been full of that little pride . But now I have long accounted it one of the first axioms of political economy you are following me , Mistress Ridd ? '

Now , to return to our muttons a figure which you will appreciate I may now be regarded , I think , as this young lady 's legal guardian ; although I have not had the honour of being formally appointed such . Her father was the eldest son of Sir Ensor Doone ; and I happened to be the second son ; and as young maidens can not be baronets , I suppose I am " Sir Counsellor .

208733	208817	208627	208628	the Counsellor	1087	' I was speaking , madam , of higher usefulness , power of the brain and heart . The main thing for us upon earth is to take a large view of things . But while we talk of the heart , what is my niece Lorna doing , that she does not come and thank me , for my perhaps too prompt concession to her youthful fancies ? Ah , if I had wanted thanks , I should have been more stubborn . '
208855	208866	208833	208833	her	311	' For what am I to thank you , uncle ? '
208867	208906	208002	208002	she	683	' My dear niece , I have told you . For removing the heaviest obstacle , which to a mind so well regulated could possibly have existed , between your dutiful self and the object of your affections . '
208907	208945	208833	208833	her	311	' Well , uncle , I should be very grateful , if I thought that you did so from love of me ; or if I did not know that you have something yet concealed from me . '
208946	208951	208953	208954	the Counsellor	1087	' And my consent , '
208956	209012	208953	208954	the Counsellor	1087	' is the more meritorious , the more liberal , frank , and candid , in the face of an existing fact , and a very clearly established one ; which might have appeared to weaker minds in the light of an impediment ; but to my loftier view of matrimony seems quite a recommendation . '
209013	209031	208833	208833	her	311	' What fact do you mean , sir ? Is it one that I ought to know ? '
209032	209156	208833	208833	her	311	' In my opinion it is , good niece . It forms , to my mind , so fine a basis for the invariable harmony of the matrimonial state . To be brief as I always endeavour to be , without becoming obscure you two young people ah , what a gift is youth ! one can never be too thankful for it you will have the rare advantage of commencing married life , with a subject of common interest to discuss , whenever you weary of well , say of one another ; if you can now , by any means , conceive such a possibility . And perfect justice meted out : mutual goodwill resulting , from the sense of reciprocity . '
209157	209178	208953	208954	the Counsellor	1087	' I do not understand you , sir . Why can you not say what you mean , at once ? '
209179	209240	208833	208833	her	311	' My dear child , I prolong your suspense . Curiosity is the most powerful of all feminine instincts ; and therefore the most delightful , when not prematurely satisfied . However , if you must have my strong realities , here they are . Your father slew dear John 's father , and dear John 's father slew yours . '

209443	209502	209503	209504	The maiden	2182	' No , sir , not to that ; even if it ever happened ; which I do not believe . But to the love betwixt me and Lorna ; which your story shall not break , without more evidence than your word . And even so , shall never break ; if Lorna thinks as I do . '
209517	209534	209503	209504	The maiden	2182	' You are right , darling : give it to him , again , like that . '

In our happy valley , nine - tenths of what is said is false ; and you were always wo nt to argue that true and false are but a blind turned upon a pivot .

But although our family is not so high now as it hath been , I have enough of the gentleman left to be pleased when good people try me . My father , Sir Ensor , was better than I in this great element of birth , and my son Carver is far worse . Aetas parentum , what is it , my boy ? I hear that you have been at a grammar - school . '
211435	211465	211473	211474	the Counsellor	1087	' So I have , your worship , and at a very good one ; but I only got far enough to make more tail than head of Latin . '

212074	212115	212065	212065	Annie	324	' what a thing it is to read books , and grow learned ! But it is very easy to try it : I will get my coral necklace ; it will not be witchcraft , will it , sir ? '
212116	212120	212121	212123	the old man	1080	' Certainly not , '
212126	212178	212121	212123	the old man	1080	' I will make the experiment myself ; and you may trust me not to be hurt , my dear . But coral will not do , my child , neither will anything coloured . The beads must be of plain common glass ; but the brighter they are the better . '
212179	212187	212189	212189	Annie	324	' Then I know the very thing , '
212191	212259	212189	212189	Annie	324	' as bright as bright can be , and without any colour in it , except in the sun or candle light . Dearest Lorna has the very thing , a necklace of some old glass - beads , or I think they called them jewels : she will be too glad to lend it to us . I will go for it , in a moment . '
212260	212333	212121	212123	the old man	1080	' My dear , it can not be half so bright as your own pretty eyes . But remember one thing , Annie , you must not say what it is for ; or even that I am going to use it , or anything at all about it ; else the charm will be broken . Bring it here , without a word ; if you know where she keeps it . '

212345	212432	212342	212342	she	324	' John used to keep it for her . But she took it away from him last week , and she wore it when I mean when somebody was here ; and he said it was very valuable , and spoke with great learning about it , and called it by some particular name , which I forget at this moment . But valuable or not , we can not hurt it , can we , sir , by passing it over the cream - pan ? '
212433	212437	212439	212440	the Counsellor	1087	' Hurt it ! '
212442	212488	212439	212440	the Counsellor	1087	' nay , we shall do it good , my dear . It will help to raise the cream : and you may take my word for it , young maiden , none can do good in this world , without in turn receiving it . '

212743	212795	212733	212734	the gentleman	1647	' I remember that old thing well enough . However , for want of a better , no doubt it will answer our purpose . Three times three , I pass it over . Crinkleum , crankum , grass and clover ! What are you feared of , you silly child ? '
212796	212840	212733	212734	the gentleman	1647	' Good sir , it is perfect witchcraft ! I am sure of that , because it rhymes . Oh , what would mother say to me ? Shall I ever go to heaven again ? Oh , I see the cream already ! '
212841	212882	212733	212734	the gentleman	1647	' To be sure you do ; but you must not look , or the whole charm will be broken , and the devil will fly away with the pan , and drown every cow you have got in it . '
212883	212911	212733	212734	the gentleman	1647	' Oh , sir , it is too horrible . How could you lead me to such a sin ? Away with thee , witch of Endor ! '

213063	213166	213054	213054	he	1080	' not a word of this to a living soul ; neither must you , nor any other enter this place for three hours at least . By that time the charm will have done its work : the pan will be cream to the bottom ; and you will bless me for a secret which will make your fortune . Put the bauble under this pannikin ; which none must lift for a day and a night . Have no fear , my simple wench ; not a breath of harm shall come to you , if you obey my orders . '
213167	213190	213054	213054	he	1080	' Oh , that I will , sir , that I will : if you will only tell me what to do . '
213191	213225	213054	213054	he	1080	' Go to your room , without so much as a single word to any one . Bolt yourself in , and for three hours now , read the Lord 's Prayer backwards . '

Why , Lorna , how is it that you never speak about your charming uncle ? Did you notice , Lizzie , how his silver hair was waving upon his velvet collar , and how white his hands were , and every nail like an acorn ; only pink like shell - fish , or at least like shells ? And the way he bowed , and dropped his eyes , from his pure respect for me ! And then , that he would not even speak , on account of his emotion ; but pressed my hand in silence ! Oh , Lizzie , you have read me beautiful things about Sir Gallyhead , and the rest ; but nothing to equal Sir Counsellor . '

214764	214800	214756	214756	I	0	' We make good the loss , Master Stickles ! Every farthing we have in the world , and the labour of our lives to boot , will never make good the tenth of it . '

Do you suppose that I can sleep , and eat my food , and go about , and look at other people , as if nothing at all had happened ? And all the time have it on my mind , that not an acre of all the land , nor even our old sheep - dog , belongs to us , of right at all ! It is more than I can do , Jeremy . Let me talk , and know the worst of it . '

I know you now too well to swear you , though I have the power . Now , my lad , what I have to say will scare your mind in one way , and ease it in another . I think that you have been hard pressed I can read you like a book , John by something which that old villain said , before he stole the necklace . You have tried not to dwell upon it ; you have even tried to make light of it for the sake of the women : but on the whole it has grieved you more than even this dastard robbery . '
215370	215432	215117	215118	Master Stickles	405	' It would have done so , Jeremy Stickles , if I could once have believed it .

Only think of loving Lorna , only think of kissing her ; and then remembering that her father had destroyed the life of mine ! '
215433	215437	215439	215440	Master Stickles	405	' Only think , '

215504	215592	215117	215118	Master Stickles	405	' I may look at it in fifty ways , and yet no good will come of it . Jeremy , I confess to you , that I tried to make the best of it ; partly to baffle the Counsellor , and partly because my darling needed my help , and bore it so , and behaved to me so nobly . But to you in secret , I am not ashamed to say that a woman may look over this easier than a man may . '
215593	215643	215439	215440	Master Stickles	405	' Because her nature is larger , my son , when she truly loves ; although her mind be smaller . Now , if I can ease you from this secret burden , will you bear , with strength and courage , the other which I plant on you ? '
215644	215651	215653	215653	I.	5708	' I will do my best , '

For instance now , among your folk , when any piece of news is told , or any man 's conduct spoken of , the very first question that arises in your mind is this " Was this action kind and good ? " Long after that , you say to yourselves , " does the law enjoin or forbid this thing ? " Now here is your fundamental error : for among all truly civilised people the foremost of all questions is , " how stands the law herein ?

My horse was scared , and leaped aside ; for a northerly wind was piping , and driving hunks of foam across , as children scatter snow - balls . But he only sank to his fetlocks in the dry sand , piled with pop - weed : and I tried to make him face the waves ; and then I looked about me . '

Nevertheless , I do assure you that my view of that little house and the way the lights were twinkling , so different from the cold and darkness of the rolling sea , moved the ancient Adam in me , if he could be found to move . I love not a house with too many windows : being out of house and doors some three - quarters of my time , when I get inside a house I like to feel the difference .

And so I made the old horse draw hand , which he was only too glad to do , and we clomb above the spring - tide mark , and over a little piece of turf , and struck the door of the hostelry . Some one came and peeped at me through the lattice overhead , which was full of bulls '
217110	217173	217094	217094	she	8720	' " Can I rest here for the night ?

When I say " charming , " I mean of course by manners and by intelligence , and most of all by cooking ; for as regards external charms most fleeting and fallacious hers had ceased to cause distress , for I can not say how many years . She said that it was the climate for even upon that subject she requested my opinion and I answered , " if there be a change , let madam blame the seasons . " '
217711	217830	217834	217834	she	5756	' However , I had not very long to strain my curiosity ; for when she found out who I was , and how I held the King 's commission , and might be called an officer , her desire to tell me all was more than equal to mine of hearing it . Many and many a day , she had longed for some one both skilful and trustworthy , most of all for some one bearing warrant from a court of justice . But the magistrates of the neighbourhood would have nothing to say to her , declaring that she was a crack - brained woman , and a wicked , and even a foreign one . '
217933	218186	217918	217918	she	5756	' By birth she was an Italian , from the mountains of Apulia , who had gone to Rome to seek her fortunes , after being badly treated in some love - affair . Her Christian name was Benita ; as for her surname , that could make no difference to any one . Being a quick and active girl , and resolved to work down her troubles , she found employment in a large hotel ; and rising gradually , began to send money to her parents . And here she might have thriven well , and married well under sunny skies , and been a happy woman , but that some black day sent thither a rich and noble English family , eager to behold the Pope . It was not , however , their fervent longing for the Holy Father which had brought them to St. Peter 's roof ; but rather their own bad luck in making their home too hot to hold them . For although in the main good Catholics , and pleasant receivers of anything , one of their number had given offence , by the folly of trying to think for himself . Some bitter feud had been among them , Benita knew not how it was ; and the sister of the nobleman who had died quite lately was married to the rival claimant , whom they all detested . It was something about dividing land ; Benita knew not what it was . '
218295	218406	218416	218417	My Lord	9182	' And so , in a very evil hour , she accepted the service of the noble Englishman , and sent her father an old shoe filled to the tongue with money , and trusted herself to fortune . But even before she went , she knew that it could not turn out well ; for the laurel leaf which she threw on the fire would not crackle even once , and the horn of the goat came wrong in the twist , and the heel of her foot was shining . This made her sigh at the starting - time ; and after that what could you hope for ? '
218531	218561	218506	218508	Only other people	5775	' Here Benita wept a little ; and I liked her none the less , and believed her ten times more ; in virtue of a tear or two . '

He kissed his hand to his wife , and said that he would save her the trouble of coming . For those two were so one in one , that they could make each other know whatever he or she had felt . And so my Lord went round the corner , with a fine young horse leaping up at the steps . '

She would not wear a piece or shape of any mourning - clothes ; she would not have a person cry , or any sorrow among us . She simply disbelieved the thing , and trusted God to right it . The Protestants , who have no faith , can not understand this feeling . Enough that so it was ; and so my Lady went to heaven . '

For the lady owned a quiet mansion in the neighbourhood of that town , and her one desire was to find refuge there , and to meet her lord , who was sure to come she said when he heard of his new infant . Therefore with only two serving - men and two maids including Benita , the party set forth from Exeter , and lay the first night at Bampton . '
219251	219400	219237	219237	she	5801	' Therefore , although it was afternoon , and the year now come to December , the horses were put to again , and the heavy coach went up the hill , with the lady and her two children , and Benita , sitting inside of it ; the other maid , and two serving - men each man with a great blunderbuss mounted upon the outside ; and upon the horses three Exeter postilions . Much had been said at Dulverton , and even back at Bampton , about some great freebooters , to whom all Exmoor owed suit and service , and paid them very punctually . Both the serving - men were scared , even over their ale , by this . But the lady only said , " Drive on ; I know a little of highwaymen : they never rob a lady . " '

It showed them also a troop of horsemen , waiting under a rock hard by , and ready to dash upon them . The postilions lashed towards the sea , and the horses strove in the depth of sand , and the serving - men cocked their blunder - busses , and cowered away behind them ; but the lady stood up in the carriage bravely , and neither screamed nor spoke , but hid her son behind her . Meanwhile the drivers drove into the sea , till the leading horses were swimming . '
219856	220007	220017	220017	she	5827	' What followed Benita knew not , as one might well suppose , herself being stunned by a blow on the head , beside being palsied with terror . " See , I have the mark now , " she said , " where the jamb of the door came down on me ! " But when she recovered her senses , she found herself lying upon the sand , the robbers were out of sight , and one of the serving - men was bathing her forehead with sea water . For this she rated him well , having taken already too much of that article ; and then she arose and ran to her mistress , who was sitting upright on a little rock , with her dead boy 's face to her bosom , sometimes gazing upon him , and sometimes questing round for the other one .

223891	225163	223887	223887	they	5959	' spirits up with some of the most pugnacious Psalms . Parson Bowden marched ahead , leading all our van and file , as against the Papists ; and promising to go with us , till we came to bullet distance . Therefore we marched bravely on , and children came to look at us . And I wondered where Uncle Reuben was , who ought to have led the culverins whereof we had no less than three , if Stickles could only have found him ; and then I thought of little Ruth ; and without any fault on my part , my heart went down within me . The culverins were laid on bark ; and all our horses pulling them , and looking round every now and then , with their ears curved up like a squirrel'd nut , and their noses tossing anxiously , to know what sort of plough it was man had been pleased to put behind them man , whose endless whims and wildness they could never understand , any more than they could satisfy . However , they pulled their very best as all our horses always do and the culverins went up the hill , without smack of whip , or swearing . It had been arranged , very justly , no doubt , and quite in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution , but as it proved not too wisely , that either body of men should act in its own county only . So when we reached the top of the hill , the sons of Devon marched on , and across the track leading into Doone - gate , so as to fetch round the western side , and attack with their culverin from the cliffs , whence the sentry had challenged me on the night of my passing the entrance . Meanwhile the yellow lads were to stay upon the eastern highland , whence Uncle Reuben and myself had reconnoitred so long ago ; and whence I had leaped into the valley at the time of the great snow - drifts . And here they were not to show themselves ; but keep their culverin in the woods , until their cousins of Devon appeared on the opposite parapet of the glen . The third culverin was entrusted to the fifteen troopers ; who , with ten picked soldiers from either trained hand , making in all five - and - thirty men , were to assault the Doone - gate itself , while the outlaws were placed between two fires from the eastern cliff and the western . And with this force went Jeremy Stickles , and with it went myself , as knowing more about the passage than any other stranger did . Therefore , if I have put it clearly , as I strive to do , you will see that the Doones must repulse at once three simultaneous attacks , from an army numbering in the whole one hundred and thirty - five men , not including the Devonshire officers ; fifty men on each side , I mean , and thirty - five at the head of the valley . The tactics of this grand campaign appeared to me so clever , and beautifully ordered , that I commended Colonel Stickles , as everybody now called him , for his great ability and mastery of the art of war . He admitted that he deserved high praise ; but said that he was not by any means equally certain of success , so large a proportion of his forces being only a raw militia , brave enough no doubt for anything , when they saw their way to it ; but knowing little of gunnery , and wholly unused to be shot at . Whereas all the Doones were practised marksmen , being compelled when lads like the Balearic slingers to strike down their meals before tasting them . And then Colonel Stickles asked me , whether I myself could stand fire ; he knew that I was not a coward , but this was a different question . I told him that I had been shot at , once or twice before ; but nevertheless disliked it , as much as almost anything . Upon that he said that I would do ; for that when a man got over the first blush of diffidence , he soon began to look upon it as a puff of destiny . I wish I could only tell what happened , in the battle of that day , especially as nearly all the people round these parts , who never saw gun - fire in it , have gotten the tale so much amiss ; and some of them will even stand in front of my own hearth , and contradict me to the teeth ; although at the time they were not born , nor their fathers put into breeches . But in truth , I can not tell , exactly , even the part in which I helped , how then can I be expected , time by time , to lay before you , all the little ins and outs of places , where I myself was not ? Only I can contradict things , which I know could not have been ; and what I plainly saw should not be controverted in my own house . Now we five - and - thirty men lay back a little way round the corner , in the hollow of the track which leads to the strong Doone - gate . Our culverin was in amongst us , loaded now to the muzzle , and it was not comfortable to know that it might go off at any time . Although the yeomanry were not come according to arrangement , some of us had horses there ; besides the horses who dragged the cannon , and now were sniffing at it . And there were plenty of spectators to mind these horses for us , as soon as we should charge ; inasmuch as all our friends and neighbours , who had so keenly prepared for the battle , now resolved to take no part , but look on , and praise the winners . At last we heard the loud bang - bang , which proved that Devon and Somerset were pouring their indignation hot into the den of malefactors , or at least so we supposed ; therefore at double quick march we advanced round the bend of the cliff which had hidden us , hoping to find the gate undefended , and to blow down all barriers with the fire of our cannon . And indeed it seemed likely at first to be so , for the wild and mountainous gorge of rock appeared to be all in pure loneliness , except where the coloured coats of our soldiers , and their metal trappings , shone with the sun behind them . Therefore we shouted a loud hurrah , as for an easy victory . But while the sound of our cheer rang back among the crags above us , a shrill clear whistle cleft the air for a single moment , and then a dozen carbines bellowed , and all among us flew murderous lead . Several of our men rolled over , but the rest rushed on like Britons , Jeremy and myself in front , while we heard the horses plunging at the loaded gun behind us . '
225169	225173	223887	223887	they	5959	' cried Jeremy , '
225183	225914	223887	223887	they	5959	' For he saw that the foe was overhead in the gallery of brushwood . Our men with a brave shout answered him , for his courage was fine example ; and we leaped in under the feet of the foe , before they could load their guns again . But here , when the foremost among us were past , an awful crash rang behind us , with the shrieks of men , and the din of metal , and the horrible screaming of horses . The trunk of the tree had been launched overhead , and crashed into the very midst of us . Our cannon was under it , so were two men , and a horse with his poor back broken . Another horse vainly struggled to rise , with his thigh - bone smashed and protruding . Now I lost all presence of mind at this , for I loved both those good horses , and shouting for any to follow me , dashed headlong into the cavern . Some five or six men came after me , the foremost of whom was Jeremy , when a storm of shot whistled and patted around me , with a blaze of light and a thunderous roar . On I leaped , like a madman , and pounced on one gunner , and hurled him across his culverin ; but the others had fled , and a heavy oak door fell to with a bang , behind them . So utterly were my senses gone , and naught but strength remaining , that I caught up the cannon with both hands , and dashed it , breech - first , at the doorway . The solid oak burst with the blow , and the gun stuck fast , like a builder 's putlog . But here I looked round in vain for any one to come and follow up my success . The scanty light showed me no figure moving through the length of the tunnel behind me ; only a heavy groan or two went to my heart , and chilled it . So I hurried back to seek Jeremy , fearing that he must be smitten down . And so indeed I found him , as well as three other poor fellows , struck by the charge of the culverin , which had passed so close beside me . Two of the four were as dead as stones , and growing cold already , but Jeremy and the other could manage to groan , just now and then . So I turned my attention to them , and thought no more of fighting . Having so many wounded men , and so many dead among us , we loitered at the cavern 's mouth , and looked at one another , wishing only for somebody to come and take command of us . But no one came ; and I was griefed so much about poor Jeremy , besides being wholly unused to any violence of bloodshed , that I could only keep his head up , and try to stop him from bleeding . And he looked up at me pitifully , being perhaps in a haze of thought , as a calf looks at a butcher . The shot had taken him in the mouth ; about that no doubt could be , for two of his teeth were in his beard , and one of his lips was wanting . I laid his shattered face on my breast , and nursed him , as a woman might . But he looked at me with a jerk at this ; and I saw that he wanted coolness . While here we stayed , quite out of danger for the fellows from the gallery could by no means shoot us , even if they remained there , and the oaken door whence the others fled was blocked up by the culverin , a boy who had no business there being in fact our clerk 's apprentice to the art of shoe - making came round the corner upon us in the manner which boys , and only boys , can use with grace and freedom ; that is to say , with a sudden rush , and a sidelong step , and an impudence , '
225921	225926	223887	223887	they	5959	' cried the boy ; '
225945	225956	225941	225942	the Doones	926	'em both . Maister Ridd , even thee be drashed . '
226954	226961	226962	226962	I	0	' Surely we have woes enough , '
226987	227080	227081	227082	Jeremy Stickles	405	' surely all this smell of wounds is not incense men should pay to the God who made them . Death , when it comes and is done with , may be a bliss to any one ; but the doubt of life or death , when a man lies , as it were , like a trunk upon a sawpit and a grisly head looks up at him , and the groans of pain are cleaving him , this would be beyond all bearing but for Nature 's sap sweet hope . '
227128	227141	227113	227113	He	405	' Fools , let me die , then I shall have some comfort '
228071	228599	228873	228873	them	6083	' service , until they lusted for something else . Even the wounded men ate nobly ; all except poor Jeremy , who was forced to have a young elder shoot , with the pith drawn , for to feed him . And once , when they wanted pickled loach from my description of it , I took up my boyish sport again , and pronged them a good jarful . Therefore , none of them could complain ; and yet they were not satisfied ; perhaps for want of complaining . Be that as it might , we knew that if they once resolved to go as they might do at any time , with only a corporal over them all our house , and all our goods , ay , and our own precious lives , would and must be at the mercy of embittered enemies . For now the Doones , having driven back , as every one said , five hundred men though not thirty had ever fought with them were in such feather all round the country , that nothing was too good for them . Offerings poured in at the Doone gate , faster than Doones could away with them , and the sympathy both of Devon and Somerset became almost oppressive . And perhaps this wealth of congratulation , and mutual good feeling between plundered and victim , saved us from any piece of spite ; kindliness having won the day , and every one loving every one . But yet another cause arose , and this the strongest one of all , to prove the need of Stickles 's aid , and calamity of his illness . And this came to our knowledge first , without much time to think of it . For two men appeared at our gate one day , stripped to their shirts , and void of horses , and looking very sorrowful . Now having some fear of attack from the Doones , and scarce knowing what their tricks might be , we received these strangers cautiously , desiring to know who they were before we let them see all our premises . However , it soon became plain to us that although they might not be honest fellows , at any rate they were not Doones ; and so we took them in , and fed , and left them to tell their business . And this they were glad enough to do ; as men who have been maltreated almost always are . And it was not for us to contradict them , lest our victuals should go amiss . These two very worthy fellows nay , more than that by their own account , being downright martyrs were come , for the public benefit , from the Court of Chancery , sitting for everybody 's good , and boldly redressing evil . This court has a power of scent unknown to the Common - law practitioners , and slowly yet surely tracks its game ; even as the great lumbering dogs , now introduced from Spain , and called by some people '
228602	228870	228873	228873	them	6083	' differ from the swift gaze - hound , who sees his prey and runs him down in the manner of the common lawyers . If a man 's ill fate should drive him to make a choice between these two , let him rather be chased by the hounds of law , than tracked by the dogs of Equity . Now , as it fell in a very black day for all except the lawyers His Majesty 's Court of Chancery , if that be what it called itself , gained scent of poor Lorna 's life , and of all that might be made of it . Whether through that brave young lord who ran into such peril , or through any of his friends , or whether through that deep old Counsellor , whose game none might penetrate ; or through any disclosures of the Italian woman , or even of Jeremy himself ; none just now could tell us ; only this truth was too clear Chancery had heard of Lorna , and then had seen how rich she was ; and never delaying in one thing , had opened mouth , and swallowed her . The Doones , with a share of that dry humour which was in them hereditary , had welcomed the two apparitors if that be the proper name for them and led them kindly down the valley , and told them then to serve their writ . Misliking the look of things , these poor men began to fumble among their clothes ; upon which the Doones cried , '
228886	229263	229264	229264	We	6085	' And with no more manners than that , they stripped , and lashed them out of the valley ; only bidding them come to us , if they wanted Lorna Doone ; and to us they came accordingly . Neither were they sure at first but that we should treat them so ; for they had no knowledge of the west country , and thought it quite a godless place , wherein no writ was holy . We however comforted and cheered them so considerably , that , in gratitude , they showed their writs , to which they had stuck like leeches . And these were twofold ; one addressed to Mistress Lorna Doone , so called , and bidding her keep in readiness to travel whenever called upon , and commit herself to nobody , except the accredited messengers of the right honourable Court ; while the other was addressed to all subjects of His Majesty , having custody of Lorna Doone , or any power over her . And this last threatened and exhorted , and held out hopes of recompense , if she were rendered truly . My mother and I held consultation , over both these documents , with a mixture of some wrath and fear , and a fork of great sorrow to stir them . And now having Jeremy Stickles 's leave , which he gave with a nod when I told him all , and at last made him understand it , I laid bare to my mother as well what I knew , as what I merely surmised , or guessed , concerning Lorna 's parentage . All this she received with great tears , and wonder , and fervent thanks to God , and still more fervent praise of her son , who had nothing whatever to do with it . However , now the question was , how to act about these writs . And herein it was most unlucky that we could not have Master Stickles , with his knowledge of the world , and especially of the law - courts , to advise us what to do , and to help in doing it . And firstly of the first I said , '
229279	229321	229273	229273	we	6085	' To this , in some measure , dear mother agreed , though she could not see the justice of it , yet thought that it might be wiser , because of our want of practice . And then I said , '
229346	229347	229354	229354	thyself	6088	' '
229359	229822	229354	229354	thyself	6088	' mother replied with a mournful smile , misdoubting what the end might be . So I took the slip of brown parchment , and went to seek my darling . Lorna was in her favourite place , the little garden which she tended with such care and diligence . Seeing how the maiden loved it , and was happy there , I had laboured hard to fence it from the dangers of the wood . And here she had corrected me , with better taste , and sense of pleasure , and the joys of musing . For I meant to shut out the brook , and build my fence inside of it ; but Lorna said no ; if we must have a fence , which could not but be injury , at any rate leave the stream inside , and a pleasant bank beyond it . And soon I perceived that she was right , though not so much as afterwards ; for the fairest of all things in a garden , and in summer - time most useful , is a brook of crystal water ; where a man may come and meditate , and the flowers may lean and see themselves , and the rays of the sun are purfied . Now partly with her own white hands , and partly with Gwenny 's red ones , Lorna had made of this sunny spot a haven of beauty to dwell in . It was not only that colours lay in the harmony we would seek of them , neither was it the height of plants , sloping to one another ; nor even the delicate tone of foliage following suit , and neighbouring . Even the breathing of the wind , soft and gentle in and out , moving things that need not move , and passing longer - stalked ones , even this was not enough among the flush of fragrance , to tell a man the reason of his quiet satisfaction . But so it shall for ever be . As the river we float upon with wine , and flowers , and music , is nothing at the well - spring but a bubble without reason . Feeling many things , but thinking without much to guide me , over the grass - plats laid between , I went up to Lorna . She in a shower of damask roses , raised her eyes and looked at me . And even now , in those sweet eyes , so deep with loving - kindness , and soft maiden dreamings , there seemed to be a slight unwilling , half confessed withdrawal ; overcome by love and duty , yet a painful thing to see . '
229825	229829	229354	229354	thyself	6088	' I said , '
229868	229869	229872	229872	you	459	' '
229875	229895	229897	229897	you	459	' she answered trembling , not having been vey strong of late , and now surprised at my manner ; '
229906	229907	229897	229897	you	459	' '
229912	229916	229897	229897	you	459	' I replied ; '
230006	230007	229988	229988	you	459	' '
230011	230025	230026	230026	you	459	' cried Lorna , with all the brightness of her playful ways returning : '
230086	230146	230147	230147	you	459	' During these words she leaned upon me , half in gay imitation of what I had so often made her do , and half in depth of earnestness , as the thrice - repeated word grew stronger , and grew warmer , with and to her heart . And as she looked up at the finish , saying , '
230149	230178	230147	230147	you	459	' so musically , I was much inclined to clasp her round ; but remembering who she was , forbore ; at which she seemed surprised with me . '
230207	230232	230182	230182	I	0	' Mistress Lorna , you must keep your rank and proper dignity . You must never look at me with anything but pity now . '
230233	230244	230246	230246	Lorna	311	' I shall look at you with pity , John , '
230263	230337	230246	230246	Lorna	311	' if you talk any more of this nonsense , knowing me as you ought to do . I shall even begin to think that you , and your friends , are weary of me , and of so long supporting me ; and are only seeking cause to send me back to my old misery . If it be so , I will go . My life matters little to any one . '
230354	230361	230362	230362	I	0	' Sweetest of all sweet loves , '
230374	230385	230362	230362	I	0	' what possibility could make me ever give up Lorna ? '
230386	230392	230393	230393	she	2182	' Dearest of all dears , '

230472	230477	230479	230479	I	0	' Now , Lorna , '

230533	230563	230521	230521	she	2182	' since I know your strength of kindness , scarcely any tale can move me , unless it be of yourself , love ; or of my poor mother . '
230564	230581	230479	230479	I	0	' It is of your poor mother , darling . Can you bear to hear it ? '
230597	230628	230587	230587	she	2182	' Yes , I can bear anything . But although I can not see her , and have long forgotten , I could not bear to hear ill of her . '
230629	230658	230671	230671	her	2182	' There is no ill to hear , sweet child , except of evil done to her . Lorna , you are of an ill - starred race . '
230659	230667	230668	230668	she	2182	' Better that than a wicked race , '
230679	230699	230668	230668	she	2182	' tell me I am not a Doone , and I will but I can not love you more . '
230700	230729	230671	230671	her	2182	' You are not a Doone , my Lorna , for that , at least , I can answer ; though I know not what your name is . '

230741	230785	230671	230671	her	2182	' Your father and mine never met one another . Your father was killed by an accident in the Pyrenean mountains , and your mother by the Doones ; or at least they caused her death , and carried you away from her . '

231039	231053	231021	231021	I	0	' do you not even wish to know what your proper name is ? '

231484	231517	231476	231476	she	311	' I know it , dear ; I have known it long ; but it never frightens me . It makes me sad , and very lonely , till I can remember . '

231786	231810	231784	231784	I	0	' the whole of it lies in a syllable . Now you know my entire want ; and want must be my comfort . '
231811	231842	231843	231843	She	4494	' But surely if I have money , sir , and birth , and rank , and all sorts of grandeur , you would never dare to think of me . '

231971	231986	231987	231987	she	4494	' Oh , you fearful stupid , John , you inexpressibly stupid , John , '
232003	232040	231987	231987	she	4494	' you have called yourself thick - headed , John , and I never would believe it . But now I do with all my heart . Will you never know what I am , love ? '
232041	232089	231997	231997	her	4494	' No , Lorna , that I never shall . I can understand my mother well , and one at least of my sisters , and both the Snowe girls very easily , but you I never understand ; only love you all the more for it . '
232090	232162	231987	231987	she	4494	' Then never try to understand me , if the result is that , dear John . And yet I am the very simplest of all foolish simple creatures . Nay , I am wrong ; therein I yield the palm to you , my dear . To think that I can act so ! No wonder they want me in London , as an ornament for the stage , John . '
233092	233095	233078	233079	any one	8750	' at attention '
233690	234022	233689	233689	lawyers	3017	' hands , have cause to wish herself most heartily back among the robbers , I set forth one day for Watchett , taking advantage of the visit of some troopers from an outpost , who would make our house quite safe . I rode alone , being fully primed , and having no misgivings . For it was said that even the Doones had begun to fear me , since I cast their culverin through the door , as above related ; and they could not but believe , from my being still untouched although so large an object in the thickest of their fire , both of gun and cannon , that I must bear a charmed life , proof against ball and bullet . However , I knew that Carver Doone was not a likely man to hold any superstitious opinions ; and of him I had an instinctive dread , although quite ready to face him . Riding along , I meditated upon Lorna 's history ; how many things were now beginning to unfold themselves , which had been obscure and dark ! For instance , Sir Ensor Doone 's consent , or to say the least his indifference , to her marriage with a yeoman ; which in a man so proud though dying had greatly puzzled both of us . But now , if she not only proved to be no grandchild of the Doone , but even descended from his enemy , it was natural enough that he should feel no great repugnance to her humiliation . And that Lorna 's father had been a foe to the house of Doone I gathered from her mother 's cry when she beheld their leader . Moreover that fact would supply their motive in carrying off the unfortunate little creature , and rearing her among them , and as one of their own family ; yet hiding her true birth from her . She was a '
234026	234419	233689	233689	lawyers	3017	' as we say , when playing All - fours at Christmas - time ; and if one of them could marry her , before she learned of right and wrong , vast property , enough to buy pardons for a thousand Doones , would be at their mercy . And since I was come to know Lorna better , and she to know me thoroughly many things had been outspoken , which her early bashfulness had kept covered from me . Attempts I mean to pledge her love to this one , or that other ; some of which perhaps might have been successful , if there had not been too many . And then , as her beauty grew richer and brighter , Carver Doone was smitten strongly , and would hear of no one else as a suitor for her ; and by the terror of his claim drove off all the others . Here too may the explanation of a thing which seemed to be against the laws of human nature , and upon which I longed , but dared not to cross - question Lorna . How could such a lovely girl , although so young , and brave , and distant , have escaped the vile affections of a lawless company ? But now it was as clear as need be . For any proven violence would have utterly vitiated all claim upon her grand estate ; at least as those claims must be urged before a court of equity . And therefore all the elders with views upon her real estate kept strict watch on the youngers , who confined their views to her personality . Now I do not mean to say that all this , or the hundred other things which came , crowding consideration , were half as plain to me at the time , as I have set them down above . Far be it from me to deceive you so . No doubt my thoughts were then dark and hazy , like an oil - lamp full of fungus ; and I have trimmed them , as when they burned , with scissors sharpened long afterwards . All I mean to say is this , that jogging along to a certain tune of the horse 's feet , which we call '
234426	234551	233689	233689	lawyers	3017	' I saw my way a little into some things which had puzzled me . When I knocked at the little door , whose sill was gritty and grimed with sand , no one came for a very long time to answer me , or to let me in . Not wishing to be unmannerly , I waited a long time , and watched the sea , from which the wind was blowing ; and whose many lips of waves though the tide was half - way out spoke to and refreshed me . After a while I knocked again , for my horse was becoming hungry ; and a good while after that again , a voice came through the key - hole , '
234559	234560	234561	234567	The boy who was at the pump	6177	' '
234569	234573	234561	234567	The boy who was at the pump	6177	' said I , '
234600	234601	234593	234593	you	6180	' '
234635	234662	234620	234620	I	0	' She was opening the door , while saying this , and then she started back in affright that the little boy should have grown so . '

234724	234725	234712	234712	I	0	' '
234735	234865	234729	234729	you	6180	' she answered , with her dark eyes brightened . And I went in , and looked at her . She was altered by time , as much as I was . The slight and graceful shape was gone ; not that I remembered anything of her figure , if you please ; for boys of twelve are not yet prone to note the shapes of women ; but that her lithe straight gait had struck me as being so unlike our people . Now her time for walking so was past , and transmitted to her children . Yet her face was comely still , and full of strong intelligence . I gazed at her , and she at me ; and we were sure of one another . '
234874	234889	234729	234729	you	6180	' she asked , with a lively glance at the size of my mouth : '
234905	234906	234729	234729	you	6180	' '
234917	234927	234907	234907	I	0	' I answered , misliking this satire upon us ; '

234958	234976	234951	234956	One quevart of be - or	6190	' she called out to a little maid , who was her eldest child , no doubt . '

235009	235013	234951	234956	One quevart of be - or	6190	' I replied , '
235075	235076	235068	235069	No one	821	' '
235085	235095	235079	235079	I	0	' she said , with an air of resignation ; '
235122	235123	235115	235115	you	8749	' '
235133	235146	235131	235131	madam	900	' I answered with indignation , for beer is my favourite beverage ; '
235166	235167	235172	235172	you	8749	' '
235211	235669	235673	235673	her	6203	' Now I only set down that to show how perverse those foreign people are . They will drink their wretched heartless stuff , such as they call claret , or wine of Medoc , or Bordeaux , or what not , with no more meaning than sour rennet , stirred with the pulp from the cider press , and strained through the cap of our Betty . This is very well for them ; and as good as they deserve , no doubt , and meant perhaps by the will of God , for those unhappy natives . But to bring it over to England and set it against our home - brewed ale not to speak of wines from Portugal and sell it at ten times the price , as a cure for British bile , and a great enlightenment ; this I say is the vilest feature of the age we live in . Madam Benita Odam for the name of the man who turned the wheel proved to be John Odam showed me into a little room containing two chairs and a fir - wood table , and sat down on a three - legged seat and studied me very steadfastly . This she had a right to do ; and I , having all my clothes on now , was not disconcerted . It would not become me to repeat her judgment upon my appearance , which she delivered as calmly as if I were a pig at market , and as proudly as if her own pig . And she asked me whether I had ever got rid of the black marks on my breast . Not wanting to talk about myself though very fond of doing so , when time and season favour I led her back to that fearful night of the day when first I had seen her . She was not desirous to speak of it , because of her own little children ; however , I drew her gradually to recollection of Lorna , and then of the little boy who died , and the poor mother buried with him . And her strong hot nature kindled , as she dwelled upon these things ; and my wrath waxed within me ; and we forgot reserve and prudence under the sense of so vile a wrong . She told me as nearly as might be the very same story which she had told to Master Jeremy Stickles ; only she dwelled upon it more , because of my knowing the outset . And being a woman , with an inkling of my situation , she enlarged upon the little maid , more than to dry Jeremy . '
235676	235695	235697	235697	you	6202	' I asked , being stirred by these accounts of Lorna , when she was five years old : '
235707	235708	235709	235709	I	0	' '
235714	235718	235709	235709	I	0	' she answered ; '
235781	235904	235905	235907	The little maid	1277	' As she raised her hands and eyes in horror at our carnivorous propensities , to which she clearly attributed the disappearance of Lorna , I could scarce help laughing , even after that sad story . For though it is said at the present day , and will doubtless be said hereafter , that the Doones had devoured a baby once , as they came up Porlock hill , after fighting hard in the market - place , I knew that the tale was utterly false ; for cruel and brutal as they were , their taste was very correct and choice , and indeed one might say fastidious . Nevertheless I could not stop to argue that matter with her . '
235913	235920	235905	235907	The little maid	1277	' I said to Mistress Odam : '
235970	235971	235954	235954	you	6214	' '
236003	236229	235992	235993	my God	6218	' She surveyed herself with a glance so mingled of pity and admiration , and the truth of her words was so apparent only that it would have taken a week to get at the bones , before picking that I nearly lost good manners ; for she really seemed to suspect even me of cannibal inclinations . However , at last I made her promise to come with me on the morrow , presuming that Master Odam could by any means be persuaded to keep her company in the cart , as propriety demanded . Having little doubt that Master Odam was entirely at his wife 's command , I looked upon that matter as settled , and set off for Watchett , to see the grave of Lorna 's poor mother , and to hire a cart for the morrow . And here as so often happens with men I succeeded without any trouble or hindrance , where I had looked for both of them , namely , in finding a suitable cart ; whereas the other matter , in which I could have expected no difficulty , came very near to defeat me . For when I heard that Lorna 's father was the Earl of Dugal as Benita impressed upon me with a strong enforcement , as much as to say , '
236244	236986	236232	236232	you	6219	' then I never thought but that everybody in Watchett town must know all about the tombstone of the Countess of Dugal . This , however , proved otherwise . For Lord Dugal had never lived at Watchett Grange , as their place was called ; neither had his name become familiar as its owner . Because the Grange had only devolved to him by will , at the end of a long entail , when the last of the Fitz - Pains died out ; and though he liked the idea of it , he had gone abroad , without taking seisin . And upon news of his death , John Jones , a rich gentleman from Llandaff , had taken possession , as next of right , and hushed up all the story . And though , even at the worst of times , a lady of high rank and wealth could not be robbed , and as bad as murdered , and then buried in a little place , without moving some excitement , yet it had been given out , on purpose and with diligence , that this was only a foreign lady travelling for her health and pleasure , along the seacoast of England . And as the poor thing never spoke , and several of her servants and her baggage looked so foreign , and she herself died in a collar of lace unlike any made in England , all Watchett , without hesitation , pronounced her to be a foreigner . And the English serving man and maid , who might have cleared up everything , either were bribed by Master Jones , or else decamped of their own accord with the relics of the baggage . So the poor Countess of Dugal , almost in sight of her own grand house , was buried in an unknown grave , with her pair of infants , without a plate , without a tombstone worse than all without a tear , except from the hired Italian woman . Surely my poor Lorna came of an ill - starred family . Now in spite of all this , if I had only taken Benita with me , or even told her what I wished , and craved her directions , there could have been no trouble . But I do assure you that among the stupid people at Watchett compared with whom our folk of Oare , exceeding dense though being , are as Hamlet against Dogberry what with one of them and another , and the firm conviction of all the town that I could be come only to wrestle , I do assure you as I said before that my wits almost went out of me . And what vexed me yet more about it was , that I saw my own mistake , in coming myself to seek out the matter , instead of sending some unknown person . For my face and form were known at that time and still are so to nine people out of every ten living in forty miles of me . Not through any excellence , or anything of good desert , in either the one or the other , but simply because folks will be fools on the rivalry of wrestling . The art is a fine one in itself , and demands a little wit of brain , as well as strength of body ; it binds the man who studies it to temperance , and chastity , to self - respect , and most of all to an even and sweet temper ; for I have thrown stronger men than myself when I was a mere sapling , and before my strength grew hard on me through their loss of temper . But though the art is an honest one , surely they who excel therein have a right like all the rest of man - kind to their own private life . Be that either way and I will not speak too strongly , for fear of indulging my own annoyance anyhow , all Watchett town cared ten times as much to see John Ridd , as to show him what he wanted . I was led to every public - house , instead of to the churchyard ; and twenty tables were ready for me , in lieu of a single gravestone . '
237023	237363	237021	237021	lad	8570	' And so it went on , till I was weary ; though very much obliged to them . Dull and solid as I am , and with a wild duck waiting for me at good Mistress Odam 's , I saw that there was nothing for it but to yield to these good people , and prove me a man of Somerset , by eating a dinner at their expense . As for the churchyard , none would hear of it ; and I grieved for broaching the matter . But how was I to meet Lorna again , without having done the thing of all things which I had promised to see to ? It would never do to tell her that so great was my popularity , and so strong the desire to feed me , that I could not attend to her mother . Least of all could I say that every one in Watchett knew John Ridd ; while none had heard of the Countess of Dugal . And yet that was about the truth , as I hinted very delicately to Mistress Odam that evening . But she being vexed about her wild duck , and not having English ideas on the matter of sport , and so on made a poor unwitting face at me . Nevertheless Master Odam restored me to my self - respect ; for he stared at me till I went to bed ; and he broke his hose with excitement . For being in the leg - line myself , I wanted to know what the muscles were of a man who turned a wheel all day . I had never seen a treadmill though they have one now at Exeter , and it touched me much to learn whether it were good exercise . And herein , from what I saw of Odam , I incline to think that it does great harm ; as moving the muscles too much in a line , and without variety .

We do not fear your taking to the highway life again ; for that you are too clever , no doubt , now that you have property . But we fear that you will take to drinking , and to squandering money .

For nothing could be easier than to cheat Lorna about the cost , until time should come for her paying me . And this was better than to cheat her for the benefit of our family . For this end , and for many others , I set off to Dulverton , bearing more commissions , more messages , and more questions than a man of thrice my memory might carry so far as the corner where the sawpit is . And to make things worse , one girl or other would keep on running up to me , or even after me when started with something or other she had just thought of , which she could not possibly do without , and which I must be sure to remember , as the most important of the whole . To my dear mother , who had partly outlived the exceeding value of trifles , the most important matter seemed to ensure Uncle Reuben 's countenance and presence at the marriage . And if I succeeded in this , I might well forget all the maidens '

242809	242912	242695	242695	I	0	' In the first place , Cousin Ridd , grandfather will be angry with himself , for having so ill - used you . And now he is so weak and poorly , that he is always repenting . In the next place I shall scold him first , until he admits his sorrow ; and when he has admitted it , I shall scold myself for scolding him . And then he will come round again , and think that I was hard on him ; and end perhaps by hating you for he is like a woman now , John . '

243403	243502	243400	243400	he	2047	' here 's your health , young fellow , and a good and obedient wife to you . Not that your wife will ever obey you though ; you are much too easy - tempered . Even a bitter and stormy woman might live in peace with you , Jack . But never you give her the chance to try . Marry some sweet little thing , if you can . If not , do n't marry any . Ah , we have the maid to suit you , my lad , in this old town of Dulverton . '
243503	243522	243621	243623	the old man	1080	' Have you so , sir ? But perhaps the maid might have no desire to suit me . '

The little sly hussy has been to the cobwebbed arch of the cellar , where she has no right to go , for any one under a magistrate . However , I am glad to see it , and we will not spare it , John . After my time , somebody , whoever marries little Ruth , will find some rare wines there , I trow , and perhaps not know the difference . '

Beside it were several sledge - hammers , battered , and some with broken helves . '
248776	248788	248772	248772	Thou	6548	' cried Uncle Ben , giving the boulder a little kick ; '
248868	248869	248870	248870	I	0	' '

248960	248964	248943	248946	no man outside Carnwall	6556	' I answered ; '

249045	249051	249042	249042	thou	6561	' asked Uncle Reuben pettishly ; '
249077	249301	249075	249075	Somerset	29	' Uncle Reuben showed by saying this , and by his glance at Carfax , that he was proud of his county , and would be disappointed for it if I failed to crack the boulder . So I begged him to stoop his torch a little , that I might examine my subject . To me there appeared to be nothing at all remarkable about it , except that it sparkled here and there , when the flash of the flame fell upon it . A great obstinate , oblong , sullen stone ; how could it be worth the breaking , except for making roads with ? Nevertheless , I took up the hammer , and swinging it far behind my head , fetched it down , with all my power , upon the middle of the rock . The roof above rang mightily , and the echo went down delven galleries , so that all the miners flocked to know what might be doing . But Master Carfax only smiled , although the blow shook him where he stood , for behold the stone was still unbroken , and as firm as ever . Then I smote it again , with no better fortune , and Uncle Ben looked vexed and angry , but all the miners grinned with triumph . '
249309	249313	249316	249316	you	6563	' I cried ; '
249325	249427	249316	249316	you	6563	' Then I took two more of the weightiest hammers , and lashed them fast to the back of mine , not so as to strike , but to burden the fall . Having made this firm , and with room to grasp the handle of the largest one only for the helves of the others were shorter I smiled at Uncle Ben , and whirled the mighty implement round my head , just to try whether I could manage it . Upon that the miners gave a cheer , being honest men , and desirous of seeing fair play between this '
249430	249502	249316	249316	you	6563	' as Dan Homer calls it and me with my hammer hammering . Then I swung me on high to the swing of the sledge , as a thresher bends back to the rise of his flail , and with all my power descending delivered the ponderous onset . Crashing and crushed the great stone fell over , and threads of sparkling gold appeared in the jagged sides of the breakage . '
249509	249515	249517	249517	thou	6564	' cried Uncle Ben triumphantly ; '
249530	249531	249519	249522	a man in Cornwall	6565	' '
249537	249541	249519	249522	a man in Cornwall	6565	' he answered ; '
249571	249627	249628	249628	Thou	6564	' I was glad to have been of some service to them ; for it seems that this great boulder had been too large to be drawn along the gallery and too hard to crack . But now they moved it very easily , taking piece by piece , and carefully picking up the fragments . '
249639	249655	249628	249628	Thou	6564	' said Uncle Reuben , as the others passed out of sight at the corner ; '
249690	249787	249808	249808	them	6571	' The whole affair being a mystery to me , and far beyond my understanding , I followed him softly , without a word , yet thinking very heavily , and longing to be above ground again . He led me through small passages , to a hollow place near the descending shaft , where I saw a most extraordinary monster fitted up . In form it was like a great coffee - mill , such as I had seen in London , only a thousand times larger , and with heavy windlass to work it . '
249798	249805	249808	249808	them	6571	' said Uncle Ben to Carfax , '
249822	249823	249808	249808	them	6571	' '
249830	249835	249808	249808	them	6571	' cried Simon Carfax ; '

249950	249996	249940	249941	Uncle Ben	295	' we will digest our goodly boulder after the devil is come abroad for his evening work . Now , John , not a word about what you have learned ; but henceforth you will not be frightened by the noise we make at dusk . '
251053	251062	251063	251063	she	311	' It must be our Gwenny 's father , '
251066	251118	251063	251063	she	311	' the man who disappeared underground , and whom she has ever been seeking . How grieved the poor little thing will be , if it should turn out , after all , that he left his child on purpose ! I can hardly believe it ; can you , John ? '
251119	251122	251123	251123	I	0	' Well , '
251126	251147	251123	251123	I	0	' all men are wicked , more or less , to some extent ; and no man may say otherwise . '
251467	251699	251700	251700	My	0	' eyes , through the bloom of beauty 's promise , to the rich and ripe fulfilment , and the falling back to rest ; sea we have with all its wonder shed on eyes , and ears , and heart ; and the thought of something more but without the sky to look at , what would earth , and sea , and even our own selves , be to us ? Do we look at earth with hope ? Yes , for victuals only . Do we look at sea with hope ? Yes , that we may escape it . At the sky alone though questioned with the doubts of sunshine , or scattered with uncertain stars , at the sky alone we look with pure hope and with memory . Hence it always hurt my feelings when I got into that bucket , with my small - clothes turned up over , and a kerchief round my hat . But knowing that my purpose was sound , and my motives pure , I let the sky grow to a little blue hole , and then to nothing over me . At the bottom Master Carfax met me , being captain of the mine , and desirous to know my business . He wore a loose sack round his shoulders , and his beard was two feet long . '
251708	251763	251700	251700	My	0	' I answered rather sternly ; for this man , who was nothing more than Uncle Reuben 's servant , had carried things too far with me , showing no respect whatever ; and though I did not care for much , I liked to receive a little , even in my early days . '
251773	251795	251700	251700	My	0	' was his gracious answer ; and he led me into a filthy cell , where the miners changed their jackets . '
251809	251824	251799	251799	I	0	' I fear you are a shallow fellow , and not worth my trouble . '
251825	251832	251833	251833	he	392	' Then do n't take it , '
251836	251844	251833	251833	he	392	' I want no man 's trouble . '
251845	251853	251854	251854	I	0	' For your sake I would not , '
251857	251880	251854	251854	I	0	' but for your daughter 's sake I will ; the daughter whom you left to starve so pitifully in the wilderness . '
251914	251962	251911	251911	he	9404	' It is a lie , man . No daughter , and no son have I. Nor was ever child of mine left to starve in the wilderness . You are too big for me to tackle , and that makes you a coward for saying it . '
251982	251991	251992	251992	I	0	' Perhaps I have wronged you , Simon , '
252009	252042	251992	251992	I	0	' if I have , I crave your pardon . But did you not bring up from Cornwall a little maid named " Gwenny , " and supposed to be your daughter ? '
252043	252079	252129	252129	him	6635	' Ay , and she was my daughter , my last and only child of five ; and for her I would give this mine , and all the gold will ever come from it . '
252080	252105	251992	251992	I	0	' You shall have her , without either mine or gold ; if you only prove to me that you did not abandon her . '
252106	252114	252115	252115	He	6635	' Abandon her ! I abandon Gwenny ! '
252131	252172	252115	252115	He	6635	' They told me she was dead , and crushed , and buried in the drift here ; and half my heart died with her . The Almighty blast their mining - work , if the scoundrels lied to me ! '
252173	252182	252183	252183	I	0	' The scoundrels must have lied to you , '
252196	252214	252183	252183	I	0	' the maid is living and with us . Come up ; and you shall see her . '
252215	252220	252221	252221	he	6635	' Rig the bucket , '
252474	252482	252483	252483	I	0	' Come along , you little Vick , '
252492	252508	252483	252483	I	0	' I have a message to you , Gwenny , from the Lord in heaven . '
252509	252512	252523	252523	Her	6647	' Do n't '
252518	252522	252523	252523	Her	6647	' she answered ; '
252529	252530	252523	252523	Her	6647	' '
252550	252614	252630	252630	you	276	' Gwenny knew ; she knew in a moment . Looking into my eyes , she knew ; and hanging back from me to sigh , she knew it even better . She had not much elegance of emotion , being flat and square all over ; but none the less for that her heart came quick , and her words came slowly . '
252636	253396	252630	252630	you	276	' I answered her with a gaze alone ; and she tucked up her clothes and followed me because the road was dirty . Then I opened the door just wide enough for the child to to go her father , and left those two to have it out , as might be most natural . And they took a long time about it . Meanwhile I needs must go and tell my Lorna all the matter ; and her joy was almost as great as if she herself had found a father . And the wonder of the whole was this , that I got all the credit ; of which not a thousandth part belonged by right and reason to me . Yet so it almost always is . If I work for good desert , and slave , and lie awake at night , and spend my unborn life in dreams , not a blink , nor wink , nor inkling of my labour ever tells . It would have been better to leave unburned , and to keep undevoured , the fuel and the food of life . But if I have laboured not , only acted by some impulse , whim , caprice , or anything ; or even acting not at all , only letting things float by ; piled upon me commendations , bravoes , and applauses , almost work me up to tempt once again though sick of it the ill luck of deserving . Without intending any harm , and meaning only good indeed , I had now done serious wrong to Uncle Reuben 's prospects . For Captain Carfax was full as angry at the trick played on him as he was happy in discovering the falsehood and the fraud of it . Nor could I help agreeing with him , when he told me all of it , as with tears in his eyes he did , and ready to be my slave henceforth ; I could not forbear from owning that it was a low and heartless trick , unworthy of men who had families ; and the recoil whereof was well deserved , whatever it might end in . For when this poor man left his daughter , asleep as he supposed , and having his food , and change of clothes , and Sunday hat to see to , he meant to return in an hour or so , and settle about her sustenance in some house of the neighbourhood . But this was the very thing of all things which the leaders of the enterprise , who had brought him up from Cornwall , for his noted skill in metals , were determined , whether by fair means or foul , to stop at the very outset . Secrecy being their main object , what chance could there be of it , if the miners were allowed to keep their children in the neighbourhood ? Hence , on the plea of feasting Simon , they kept him drunk for three days and three nights , assuring him whenever he had gleams enough to ask for her that his daughter was as well as could be , and enjoying herself with the children . Not wishing the maid to see him tipsy , he pressed the matter no further ; but applied himself to the bottle again , and drank her health with pleasure . However , after three days of this , his constitution rose against it , and he became quite sober ; with a certain lowness of heart moreover , and a sense of error . And his first desire to right himself , and easiest way to do it , was by exerting parental authority upon Gwenny . Possessed with this intention for he was not a sweet tempered man , and his head was aching sadly he sought for Gwenny high and low ; first with threats , and then with fears , and then with tears and wailing . And so he became to the other men a warning and a great annoyance . Therefore they combined to swear what seemed a very likely thing , and might be true for all they knew , to wit , that Gwenny had come to seek for her father down the shaft - hole , and peering too eagerly into the dark , had toppled forward , and gone down , and lain at the bottom as dead as a stone . '
253405	253413	253398	253398	thou	6651	' the villains finished up to him , '
253456	254788	253454	253454	Sim	392	' But Simon Carfax swore that drink had lost him his wife , and now had lost him the last of his five children , and would lose him his own soul , if further he went on with it ; and from that day to his death he never touched strong drink again . Nor only this ; but being soon appointed captain of the mine , he allowed no man on any pretext to bring cordials thither ; and to this and his stern hard rule and stealthy secret management as much as to good luck and place might it be attributed that scarcely any but themselves had dreamed about this Exmoor mine . As for me , I had no ambition to become a miner ; and the state to which gold - seeking had brought poor Uncle Ben was not at all encouraging . My business was to till the ground , and tend the growth that came of it , and store the fruit in Heaven 's good time , rather than to scoop and burrow like a weasel or a rat for the yellow root of evil . Moreover , I was led from home , between the hay and corn harvests when we often have a week to spare , by a call there was no resisting ; unless I gave up all regard for wrestling , and for my county . Now here many persons may take me amiss , and there always has been some confusion ; which people who ought to have known better have wrought into subject of quarrelling . By birth it is true , and can not be denied , that I am a man of Somerset ; nevertheless by breed I am , as well as by education , a son of Devon also . And just as both of our two counties vowed that Glen Doone was none of theirs , but belonged to the other one ; so now , each with hot claim and jangling leading even to blows sometimes , asserted and would swear to it as I became more famous that John Ridd was of its own producing , bred of its own true blood , and basely stolen by the other . Now I have not judged it in any way needful or even becoming and delicate , to enter into my wrestling adventures , or describe my progress . The whole thing is so different from Lorna , and her gentle manners , and her style of walking ; moreover I must seem even to kind people to magnify myself so much , or at least attempt to do it , that I have scratched out written pages , through my better taste and sense . Neither will I , upon this head , make any difference even now ; being simply betrayed into mentioning the matter because bare truth requires it , in the tale of Lorna 's fortunes . For a mighty giant had arisen in a part of Cornwall : and his calf was twenty - five inches round , and the breadth of his shoulders two feet and a quarter ; and his stature seven feet and three - quarters . Round the chest he was seventy inches , and his hand a foot across , and there were no scales strong enough to judge of his weight in the market - place . Now this man or I should say , his backers and his boasters , for the giant himself was modest sent me a brave and haughty challenge , to meet him in the ring at Bodmin - town , on the first day of August , or else to return my champion 's belt to them by the messenger . It is no use to deny but that I was greatly dashed and scared at first . For my part , I was only , when measured without clothes on , sixty inches round the breast , and round the calf scarce twenty - one , only two feet across the shoulders , and in height not six and three - quarters . However , my mother would never believe that this man could beat me ; and Lorna being of the same mind , I resolved to go and try him , as they would pay all expenses and a hundred pounds , if I conquered him ; so confident were those Cornishmen . Now this story is too well known for me to go through it again and again . Every child in Devonshire knows , and his grandson will know , the song which some clever man made of it , after I had treated him to water , and to lemon , and a little sugar , and a drop of eau - de - vie . Enough that I had found the giant quite as big as they had described him , and enough to terrify any one . But trusting in my practice and study of the art , I resolved to try a back with him ; and when my arms were round him once , the giant was but a farthingale put into the vice of a blacksmith . The man had no bones ; his frame sank in , and I was afraid of crushing him . He lay on his back , and smiled at me ; and I begged his pardon . Now this affair made a noise at the time , and redounded so much to my credit , that I was deeply grieved at it , because deserving none . For I do like a good strife and struggle ; and the doubt makes the joy of victory ; whereas in this case , I might as well have been sent for a match with a hay - mow . However , I got my hundred pounds , and made up my mind to spend every farthing in presents for mother and Lorna . For Annie was married by this time , and long before I went away ; as need scarcely be said , perhaps ; if any one follows the weeks and the months . The wedding was quiet enough , except for everybody 's good wishes ; and I desire not to dwell upon it , because it grieved me in many ways . But now that I had tried to hope the very best for dear Annie , a deeper blow than could have come , even through her , awaited me . For after that visit to Cornwall , and with my prize - money about me , I came on foot from Okehampton to Oare , so as to save a little sum towards my time of marrying . For Lorna 's fortune I would not have ; small or great I would not have it ; only if there were no denying we would devote the whole of it to charitable uses , as Master Peter Blundell had done ; and perhaps the future ages would endeavour to be grateful . Lorna and I had settled this question at least twice a day , on the average ; and each time with more satisfaction . Now coming into the kitchen with all my cash in my breeches pocket golden guineas , with an elephant on them , for the stamp of the Guinea Company , I found dear mother most heartily glad to see me safe and sound again for she had dreaded that giant , and dreamed of him and she never asked me about the money . Lizzie also was softer , and more gracious than usual ; especially when she saw me pour guineas , like peppercorns , into the pudding - basin . But by the way they hung about , I knew that something was gone wrong . '
254793	254806	254807	254807	I	0	' I asked at length , after trying not to ask it ; '
254825	254826	254818	254818	She	311	' '
254829	254837	254818	254818	She	311	' said mother with a heavy sigh ; '

254911	254928	254889	254889	Lorna	311	' my mother replied , quite calmly , for in truth she was jealous of Lorna , '
254972	254994	254958	254959	your mother	8975	' Thinking of her future absence , mother turned away and cried ; and the box - iron singed the blanket . '
254997	255007	254958	254959	your mother	8975	' said I , being wild by this time ; '
255024	255025	255017	255017	you	277	' '
255031	255047	255026	255029	The Lady Lorna Dugal	561	' said Lizzie , screwing up her lips as if the title were too grand , '
255073	255074	255075	255075	You	277	' '
255078	255107	255109	255109	Lorna	561	' I cried , which I dare not write down here , as all you are too good for such language ; but Lizzie 's lip provoked me so '
255133	255134	255127	255127	your	277	' '
255141	255145	255135	255135	You	277	' she replied ; '

255205	255214	255227	255227	she	561	' I cried , without noticing her sneer ; '
255230	255231	255227	255227	she	561	' '
255238	255253	255254	255255	the lady	5768	' said Lizzie , quite as unmoved by soft coaxing as by urgent cursing ; '
255327	255328	255309	255309	she	5768	' '
255346	255347	255343	255344	a husband	6668	' '
255367	255401	255343	255344	a husband	6668	' was the meaning of my imprecation : but Lizzie , not dreaming as yet of such things , could not understand me , and was rather thankful ; therefore she answered quietly , '
255435	255508	255420	255420	she	561	' Without another word I rushed so that every board in the house shook up to my lost Lorna 's room , and tore the little wall - niche open and espied my treasure . It was as simple , and as homely , and loving , as even I could wish . Part of it ran as follows , the other parts it behoves me not to open out to strangers : '
255843	255909	255818	255818	you	261	' Here my darling had wept again , by the tokens on the paper ; and then there followed some sweet words , too sweet for me to chatter them . But she finished with these noble lines , which being common to all humanity , in a case of steadfast love I do no harm , but rather help all true love by repeating . '
256074	256129	256071	256072	Lorna Dugal	561	' Some people can not understand that tears should come from pleasure ; but whether from pleasure or from sorrow mixed as they are in the twisted strings of a man 's heart , or a woman 's , great tears fell from my stupid eyes , even on the blots of Lorna 's . '
256137	256145	256071	256072	Lorna Dugal	561	' my mind said to me bitterly ; '
256155	256161	256147	256147	me	0	' my heart replied very sweetly .
256270	256309	256261	256261	he	1295	' Ah , to be sure ! I know him as well as ever I know my own good woman 's brother . He married Lord Flipflap 's second daughter , and a precious life she led him . '
257596	257602	257603	257603	I	0	' You precious little soul ! '
257606	257614	257603	257603	I	0	' how does Tom behave to you ? '
257615	257618	257620	257620	Annie	324	' Hush ! '
257622	257694	257620	257620	Annie	324	' how dare you ask ? He is the kindest , and the best , and the noblest of all men , John ; not even setting yourself aside . Now look not jealous , John : so it is . We all have special gifts , you know . You are as good as you can be , John ; but my husband 's special gift is nobility of character . '
257710	257719	257721	257721	I	0	' I am devilish glad to hear it , '
257730	257746	257721	257721	I	0	' keep him to that mark , my dear ; and cork the whisky bottle . '
257747	257753	257754	257754	she	324	' Yes , darling John , '
257773	257800	257754	257754	she	324	' and how is lovely Lorna ? What an age it is since I have seen you ! I suppose we must thank her for that . '
257801	257811	257813	257813	I	0	' You may thank her for seeing me now , '
257815	257819	257813	257813	I	0	' or rather , '
257826	257873	257823	257823	she	324	' you may thank my knowledge of your kindness , and my desire to speak of her to a soft - hearted dear little soul like you . I think all the women are gone mad . Even mother treats me shamefully . And as for Lizzie '
257888	257899	257901	257901	Annie	324	' Do you mean to say that Lorna is gone ? '
257925	257944	257951	257951	she	324	' Gone . And I never shall see her again . It serves me right for aspiring so . '
258044	258084	258035	258035	he	407	' horses which led almost to his ruin , by bringing him into jealousy , and flattery , and dashing ways had now been cultivated in London , and by moonlight , so that none could help admiring it . '
258087	258101	258035	258035	he	407	' I cried , for the moment dropping care and woe in astonishment : '
258126	258127	258124	258124	Annie	324	' '
258140	258171	258124	258124	Annie	324	' asked Annie , turning crimson , and dropping defiantly , and with a whisk of her dress which I never had seen before , into the very grandest one : '
258210	258211	258202	258202	you	6659	' '
258215	258219	258223	258223	you	324	' I replied : '
258282	258283	258274	258274	you	324	' '
258303	258311	258297	258297	you	6659	' and all the time she was crying '
258355	258356	258349	258349	you	6659	' '
258361	258373	258349	258349	you	6659	' I said , for Annie 's tears always conquered me ; '
258502	258503	258490	258490	her	299	' '
258508	258519	258490	258490	her	299	' Annie answered , after kissing me for my kindness : '
258568	258678	258713	258713	Annie	324	' I thought to myself that our present King had been most unlucky in one thing debts all over the kingdom . Not a man who had struck a blow for the King , or for his poor father , or even said a good word for him , in the time of his adversity , but expected at least a baronetcy , and a grant of estates to support it . Many have called King Charles ungrateful : and he may have been so . But some indulgence is due to a man , with entries few on the credit side , and a terrible column of debits . '
258686	258707	258713	258713	Annie	324	' I said , for it creaked under me very fearfully , having legs not so large as my finger ; '
258799	258860	258786	258786	you	324	' Annie was a hearty dear , and she knew that half my talk was joke , to make light of my worrying . Therefore she took it in good part , as I well knew that she would do ; and she led me to a good honest chair ; and she sat in my lap and kissed me . '
258921	258922	258923	258923	You	274	' '
258926	258930	258923	258923	You	274	' I cried , '
258956	258957	258959	258959	mother	1006	' '
258968	258969	258964	258964	mother	1006	' '
259032	259398	259401	259401	she	1372	' Being sped of my grumbling thus , and eased into better temper , I told Annie all the strange history about Lorna and her departure , and the small chance that now remained to me of ever seeing my love again . To this Annie would not hearken twice , but judging women by her faithful self , was quite vexed with me for speaking so . And then , to my surprise and sorrow , she would deliver no opinion as to what I ought to do until she had consulted darling Tom . Dear Tom knew much of the world , no doubt , especially the dark side of it . But to me it scarcely seemed becoming that my course of action with regard to the Lady Lorna Dugal should be referred to Tom Faggus , and depend upon his decision . However , I would not grieve Annie again by making light of her husband ; and so when he came in to dinner , the matter was laid before him . Now this man never confessed himself surprised , under any circumstances ; his knowledge of life being so profound , and his charity universal . And in the present case he vowed that he had suspected it all along , and could have thrown light upon Lorna 's history , if we had seen fit to apply to him . Upon further inquiry I found that this light was a very dim one , flowing only from the fact that he had stopped her mother 's coach , at the village of Bolham , on the Bampton Road , the day before I saw them . Finding only women therein , and these in a sad condition , Tom with his usual chivalry as he had no scent of the necklace allowed them to pass ; with nothing more than a pleasant exchange of courtesies , and a testimonial forced upon him , in the shape of a bottle of Burgundy wine . This the poor countess handed him ; and he twisted the cork out with his teeth , and drank her health with his hat off . '
259417	259421	259410	259410	I	0	' said Tom : '
259431	259455	259458	259458	Tom	262	' Our Annie looked rather queer at this , having no pretensions to be one : but she conquered herself , and said , '
259467	259542	259550	259550	You	6795	' With this , Tom went on the brag at once , being but a shallow fellow , and not of settled principles , though steadier than he used to be ; until I felt myself almost bound to fetch him back a little ; for of all things I do hate brag the most , as any reader of this tale must by this time know . Therefore I said to Squire Faggus , '
259693	259807	259808	259808	You	6805	' As I finished very sternly a speech which had exhausted me more than ten rounds of wrestling but I was carried away by the truth , as sometimes happens to all of us Tom had not a word to say ; albeit his mind was so much more nimble and rapid than ever mine was . He leaned against the mantelpiece a newly - invented affair in his house as if I had corded him to it , even as I spoke of doing . And he laid one hand on his breast in a way which made Annie creep softly to him , and look at me not like a sister . '
259816	259831	259814	259814	John	274	' he said at last , and the hand he gave me was trembling : '
259900	259990	259894	259894	you	6805	' He turned away , in bitter pain , that none might see his trouble ; and Annie , going along with him , looked as if I had killed our mother . For my part , I was so upset , for fear of having gone too far , that without a word to either of them , but a message on the title - page of King James his Prayer - book , I saddled Kickums , and was off , and glad of the moorland air again .
260305	260318	260281	260282	Pretty Ruth	580	' Why , Cousin Ruth , you are grown , I exclaimed ; '
260336	260916	260328	260328	you	580	' At this the little thing was so pleased , that she smiled through her blushes beautifully , and must needs come to shake hands with me ; though I signed to her not to do it , because of my horse 's temper . But scarcely was her hand in mine , when Kickums turned like an eel upon her , and caught her by the left arm with his teeth , so that she screamed with agony . I saw the white of his vicious eye , and struck him there with all my force , with my left hand over her right arm , and he never used that eye again ; none the less he kept his hold on her . Then I smote him again on the jaw , and caught the little maid up by her right hand , and laid her on the saddle in front of me ; while the horse being giddy and staggered with blows , and foiled of his spite , ran backward . Ruth 's wits were gone ; and she lay before me , in such a helpless and senseless way that I could have killed vile Kickums . I struck the spurs into him past the rowels , and away he went at full gallop ; while I had enough to do to hold on , with the little girl lying in front of me . But I called to the men who were flocking around , to send up a surgeon , as quick as could be , to Master Reuben Huckaback 's . The moment I brought my right arm to bear , the vicious horse had no chance with me ; and if ever a horse was well paid for spite , Kickums had his change that day . The bridle would almost have held a whale and I drew on it so that his lower jaw was well - nigh broken from him ; while with both spurs I tore his flanks , and he learned a little lesson . There are times when a man is more vicious than any horse may vie with . Therefore by the time we had reached Uncle Reuben 's house at the top of the hill , the bad horse was only too happy to stop ; every string of his body was trembling , and his head hanging down with impotence . I leaped from his back at once , and carried the maiden into her own sweet room . Now Cousin Ruth was recovering softly from her fright and faintness ; and the volley of the wind from galloping so had made her little ears quite pink , and shaken her locks all round her . But any one who might wish to see a comely sight and a moving one , need only have looked at Ruth Huckaback , when she learned and imagined yet more than it was the manner of her little ride with me . Her hair was of a hazel - brown , and full of waving readiness ; and with no concealment of the trick , she spread it over her eyes and face . Being so delighted with her , and so glad to see her safe , I kissed her through the thick of it , as a cousin has a right to do ; yea , and ought to do , with gravity . '
260919	260923	260917	260917	Darling	10177	' I said ; '
260938	261215	260924	260924	he	6823	' She pulled up her sleeve in the simplest manner , rather to look at it herself , than to show me where the wound was . Her sleeve was of dark blue Taunton staple ; and her white arm shone , coming out of it , as round and plump and velvety , as a stalk of asparagus , newly fetched out of the ground . But above the curved soft elbow , where no room was for one cross word according to our proverb , three sad gashes , edged with crimson , spoiled the flow of the pearly flesh . My presence of mind was lost altogether ; and I raised the poor sore arm to my lips , both to stop the bleeding and to take the venom out , having heard how wise it was , and thinking of my mother . But Ruth , to my great amazement , drew away from me in bitter haste , as if I had been inserting instead of extracting poison . For the bite of a horse is most venomous ; especially when he sheds his teeth ; and far more to be feared than the bite of a dog , or even of a cat . And in my haste I had forgotten that Ruth might not know a word about this , and might doubt about my meaning , and the warmth of my osculation . But knowing her danger , I durst not heed her childishness , or her feelings . A maid with an elbow sharp , or knee , Hath cross words two , out of every three . '
261225	261238	261222	261223	Cousin Ruth	517	' I said , catching her so that she could not move ; '
261256	261356	261247	261247	you	517	' The spread of shame on her face was such , when she saw her own misunderstanding , that I was ashamed to look at her ; and occupied myself with drawing all the risk of glanders forth from the white limb , hanging helpless now , and left entirely to my will . Before I was quite sure of having wholly exhausted suction , and when I had made the holes in her arm look like the gills of a lamprey , in came the doctor , partly drunk , and in haste to get through his business . '
261364	261368	261247	261247	you	517	' he cried ; '
261403	261404	261386	261386	Sally	333	' '
261412	261428	261409	261410	good sir	1656	' I said ; for poor little Ruth was fainting again at his savage orders : '
261467	261468	261458	261458	sir	8749	' '
261634	261983	261626	261626	I	0	' And in that melancholy plight , caring nothing for business , went one of the cleverest fellows ever known at Tiverton . He could write Latin verses a great deal faster than I could ever write English prose , and nothing seemed too great for him . We thought that he would go to Oxford and astonish every one , and write in the style of Buchanan ; but he fell all abroad very lamentably ; and now , when I met him again , was come down to push - pin and shovel - board , with a wager of spirits pending . When Master Huckaback came home , he looked at me very sulkily ; not only because of my refusal to become a slave to the gold - digging , but also because he regarded me as the cause of a savage broil between Simon Carfax and the men who had cheated him as to his Gwenny . However , when Uncle Ben saw Ruth , and knew what had befallen her , and she with tears in her eyes declared that she owed her life to Cousin Ridd , the old man became very gracious to me ; for if he loved any one on earth , it was his little granddaughter . I could not stay very long , because , my horse being quite unfit to travel from the injuries which his violence and vice had brought upon him , there was nothing for me but to go on foot , as none of Uncle Ben 's horses could take me to Plover 's Barrows , without downright cruelty : and though there would be a harvest - moon , Ruth agreed with me that I must not keep my mother waiting , with no idea where I might be , until a late hour of the night . I told Ruth all about our Annie , and her noble furniture ; and the little maid was very lively although her wounds were paining her so , that half her laughter came '
261992	262090	261626	261626	I	0	' as we rather coarsely express it ; especially she laughed about Annie 's new - fangled closet for clothes , or standing - press , as she called it . This had frightened me so that I would not come without my stick to look at it ; for the front was inlaid with two fiery dragons , and a glass which distorted everything , making even Annie look hideous ; and when it was opened , a woman 's skeleton , all in white , revealed itself , in the midst of three standing women . '
262102	262109	261989	261989	her	6834	' Annie had explained to me ; '
262160	262296	262297	262297	You	6835	' Having made poor Ruth a little cheerful , with a full account of all Annie 's frocks , material , pattern , and fashion of which I had taken a list for my mother , and for Lizzie , lest they should cry out at man 's stupidity about anything of real interest , I proceeded to tell her about my own troubles , and the sudden departure of Lorna ; concluding with all the show of indifference which my pride could muster , that now I never should see her again , and must do my best to forget her , as being so far above me . I had not intended to speak of this , but Ruth 's face was so kind and earnest , that I could not stop myself . '
262307	262326	262304	262305	Cousin Ridd	335	' she said , in a low and gentle tone , and turning away her eyes from me ; '
262370	262496	262353	262353	she	6836	' She pronounced those last few words , as I thought , with a little bitterness , unperceived by herself perhaps , for it was not in her appearance . But I , attaching great importance to a maiden 's opinion about a maiden because she might judge from experience , would have led her further into that subject . But she declined to follow , having now no more to say in a matter so removed from her . Then I asked her full and straight , and looking at her in such a manner that she could not look away , without appearing vanquished by feelings of her own which thing was very vile of me ; but all men are so selfish , '
262514	262515	262509	262509	your	11509	' '
262521	262542	262516	262516	My	0	' she answered bravely , with her dark eyes full of pride , and instead of flinching , foiling me , '
262607	262608	262609	262609	She	6840	' '
262641	262642	262634	262635	no one	821	' '
262738	263423	262727	262727	Lizzie	277	' And she fainted into the arms of Sally , who was come just in time to fetch her : no doubt she had been suffering agony all the time she talked to me . Leaving word that I would come again to inquire for her , and fetch Kickums home , so soon as the harvest permitted me , I gave directions about the horse , and striding away from the ancient town , was soon upon the moorlands . Now , through the whole of that long walk the latter part of which was led by starlight , till the moon arose I dwelt , in my young and foolish way , upon the ordering of our steps by a Power beyond us . But as I could not bring my mind to any clearness upon this matter , and the stars shed no light upon it , but rather confused me with wondering how their Lord could attend to them all , and yet to a puny fool like me , it came to pass that my thoughts on the subject were not worth ink , if I knew them . But it is perhaps worth ink to relate , so far as I can do so , mother 's delight at my return , when she had almost abandoned hope , and concluded that I was gone to London , in disgust at her behaviour . And now she was looking up the lane , at the rise of the harvest - moon , in despair , as she said afterwards . But if she had despaired in truth , what use to look at all ? Yet according to the epigram made by a good Blundellite , Despair was never yet so deep In sinking as in seeming ; Despair is hope just dropped asleep For better chance of dreaming . And mother 's dream was a happy one , when she knew my step at a furlong distant ; for the night was of those that carry sound thrice as far as day can . She recovered herself , when she was sure , and even made up her mind to scold me , and felt as if she could do it . But when she was in my arms , into which she threw herself , and I by the light of the moon descried the silver gleam on one side of her head now spreading since Annie 's departure , bless my heart and yours therewith , no room was left for scolding . She hugged me , and she clung to me ; and I looked at her , with duty made tenfold , and discharged by love . We said nothing to one another ; but all was right between us . Even Lizzie behaved very well , so far as her nature admitted ; not even saying a nasty thing all the time she was getting my supper ready , with a weak imitation of Annie . She knew that the gift of cooking was not vouchsafed by God to her ; but sometimes she would do her best , by intellect to win it . Whereas it is no more to be won by intellect than is divine poetry . An amount of strong quick heart is needful , and the understanding must second it , in the one art as in the other . Now my fare was very choice for the next three days or more ; yet not turned out like Annie 's . They could do a thing well enough on the fire ; but they could not put it on table so ; nor even have plates all piping hot . This was Annie 's special gift ; born in her , and ready to cool with her ; like a plate borne away from the fireplace . I sighed sometimes about Lorna , and they thought it was about the plates . And mother would stand and look at me , as much as to say , '
263427	263440	263441	263441	He	6844	' ; and Lizzie would jerk up one shoulder , and cry , '
263450	263646	263441	263441	He	6844	' ; while the whole truth was that I wanted not to be plagued about any cookery ; but just to have something good and quiet , and then smoke and think about Lorna . Nevertheless the time went on , with one change and another ; and we gathered all our harvest in ; and Parson Bowden thanked God for it , both in church and out of it ; for his tithes would be very goodly . The unmatched cold of the previous winter , and general fear of scarcity , and our own talk about our ruin , had sent prices up to a grand high pitch ; and we did our best to keep them there . For nine Englishmen out of every ten believe that a bitter winter must breed a sour summer , and explain away topmost prices . While according to my experience , more often it would be otherwise , except for the public thinking so . However , I have said too much ; and if any farmer reads my book , he will vow that I wrote it for nothing else except to rob his family .
263997	264364	264365	264365	I	0	' s writings at least so the innocent soul believed and we all looked forward to something great as the fruit of all this history . And something great did come of it , though not as we expected ; for these reports , or as many of them as were ever opened , stood us in good stead the next year , when we were accused of harbouring and comforting guilty rebels . Now the reason why the Doones did not attack us was that they were preparing to meet another and more powerful assault upon their fortress ; being assured that their repulse of King 's troops could not be looked over when brought before the authorities . And no doubt they were right ; for although the conflicts in the Government during that summer and autumn had delayed the matter yet positive orders had been issued that these outlaws and malefactors should at any price be brought to justice ; when the sudden death of King Charles the Second threw all things into confusion , and all minds into a panic . We heard of it first in church , on Sunday , the eighth day of February , 1684 - 5 , from a cousin of John Fry , who had ridden over on purpose from Porlock . He came in just before the anthem , splashed and heated from his ride , so that every one turned and looked at him . He wanted to create a stir knowing how much would be made of him , and he took the best way to do it . For he let the anthem go by very quietly or rather I should say very pleasingly , for our choir was exceeding proud of itself , and I sang bass twice as loud as a bull , to beat the clerk with the clarionet and then just as Parson Bowden , with a look of pride at his minstrels , was kneeling down to begin the prayer for the King 's Most Excellent Majesty for he never read the litany , except upon Easter Sunday , up jumps young Sam Fry , and shouts , '

270777	270813	270728	270730	the old man	1080	' Beyond a doubt I do , my dear . You have put it rather strongly ; and it might offend some people . Nevertheless I own my debt , having so fair a creditor . '
270814	270847	270728	270730	the old man	1080	' And do you remember how you slept , and how much we made of you , and would have seen you home , sir ; only you did not wish it ? '

270890	270901	270728	270730	the old man	1080	' Yes , I fear it has , said Annie ; '
270911	270927	270928	270928	You	0	' And here she showed some signs of crying , knowing that Counsellor hated it . '
270982	270983	270984	270984	My	0	' '
270989	270995	270984	270984	My	0	' she answered very proudly ; '
271012	271325	271006	271006	you	8745	' The Counsellor answered that he would do so , if her needs were moderate ; whereupon she opened her meaning to him , and told of all her anxieties . Considering that Lorna was gone , and her necklace in his possession , and that I against whom alone of us the Doones could bear any malice would be out of the way all the while , the old man readily undertook that our house should not be assaulted , nor our property molested , until my return . And to the promptitude of his pledge , two things perhaps contributed , namely , that he knew not how we were stripped of all defenders , and that some of his own forces were away in the rebel camp . For as I learned thereafter the Doones being now in direct feud with the present Government , and sure to be crushed if that prevailed , had resolved to drop all religious questions , and cast in their lot with Monmouth . And the turbulent youths , being long restrained from their wonted outlet for vehemence , by the troopers in the neighbourhood , were only too glad to rush forth upon any promise of blows and excitement . However , Annie knew little of this , but took the Counsellor 's pledge as a mark of especial favour in her behalf which it may have been to some extent , and thanked him for it most heartily , and felt that he had earned the necklace ; while he , like an ancient gentleman , disclaimed all obligation , and sent her under an escort safe to her own cart again . But Annie , repassing the sentinels , with her youth restored and blooming with the flush of triumph , went up to them very gravely , and said , '
271336	271398	271399	271399	I	0	' ; and so made her best curtsey . Now , look at it as I would , there was no excuse left for me , after the promise given . Dear Annie had not only cheated the Doones , but also had gotten the best of me , by a pledge to a thing impossible . And I bitterly said , '
271414	271415	271416	271416	I	0	' '
271425	271429	271416	271416	I	0	' cried Annie ; '
271449	271642	271447	271447	John	261	' And with that she vanquished me . But when my poor mother heard that I was committed , by word of honour , to a wild - goose chase , among the rebels , after that runagate Tom Faggus , she simply stared , and would not believe it . For lately I had joked with her , in a little style of jerks , as people do when out of sorts ; and she , not understanding this , and knowing jokes to be out of my power , would only look , and sigh , and toss , and hope that I meant nothing . At last , however , we convinced her that I was in earnest , and must be off in the early morning , and leave John Fry with the hay crop . Then mother was ready to fall upon Annie , as not content with disgracing us , by wedding a man of new honesty if indeed of any , but laying traps to catch her brother , and entangle him perhaps to his death , for the sake of a worthless fellow ; and '
271644	272562	271416	271416	I	0	' she was going to say , as by the shape of her lips I knew . But I laid my hand upon dear mother 's lips ; because what must be , must be ; and if mother and daughter stayed at home , better in love than in quarrelling . Right early in the morning , I was off , without word to any one ; knowing that mother and sister mine had cried each her good self to sleep ; relenting when the light was out , and sorry for hard words and thoughts ; and yet too much alike in nature to understand each other . Therefore I took good Kickums , who although with one eye spoiled was worth ten sweet - tempered horses , to a man who knew how to manage him ; and being well charged both with bacon and powder , forth I set on my wild - goose chase . For this I claim no bravery . I cared but little what came of it ; save for mother 's sake , and Annie 's , and the keeping of the farm , and discomfiture of the Snowes , and lamenting of Lorna at my death , if die I must in a lonesome manner , not found out till afterwards , and bleaching bones left to weep over . However , I had a little kettle , and a pound and a half of tobacco , and two dirty pipes and a clean one ; also a bit of clothes for change , also a brisket of hung venison , and four loaves of farmhouse bread , and of the upper side of bacon a stone and a half it might be not to mention divers small things for campaigning , which may come in handily , when no one else has gotten them . We went away in merry style ; my horse being ready for anything , and I only glad of a bit of change , after months of working and brooding ; with no content to crown the work ; no hope to hatch the brooding ; or without hatching to reckon it . Who could tell but what Lorna might be discovered , or at any rate heard of , before the end of this campaign ; if campaign it could be called of a man who went to fight nobody , only to redeem a runagate ? And vexed as I was about the hay , and the hunch - backed ricks John was sure to make which spoil the look of a farm - yard , still even this was better than to have the mows and houses fired , as I had nightly expected , and been worn out with the worry of it . Yet there was one thing rather unfavourable to my present enterprise , namely , that I knew nothing of the country I was bound to , nor even in what part of it my business might be supposed to lie . For beside the uncertainty caused by the conflict of reports , it was likely that King Monmouth 's army would be moving from place to place , according to the prospect of supplies and of reinforcements . However , there would arise more chance of getting news as I went on : and my road being towards the east and south , Dulverton would not lie so very far aside of it , but what it might be worth a visit , both to collect the latest tidings , and to consult the maps and plans in Uncle Reuben 's parlour . Therefore I drew the off - hand rein , at the cross - road on the hills , and made for the town ; expecting perhaps to have breakfast with Master Huckaback , and Ruth , to help and encourage us . This little maiden was now become a very great favourite with me , having long outgrown , no doubt , her childish fancies and follies , such as my mother and Annie had planted under her soft brown hair . It had been my duty , as well as my true interest for Uncle Ben was more and more testy , as he went on gold - digging , to ride thither , now and again , to inquire what the doctor thought of her . Not that her wounds were long in healing , but that people can scarcely be too careful and too inquisitive , after a great horse - bite . And she always let me look at the arm , as I had been first doctor ; and she held it up in a graceful manner , curving at the elbow , and with a sweep of white roundness going to a wrist the size of my thumb or so , and without any thimble - top standing forth , such as even our Annie had . But gradually all I could see , above the elbow , where the bite had been , was very clear , transparent skin , with very firm sweet flesh below , and three little blue marks as far asunder as the prongs of a toasting - fork , and no deeper than where a twig has chafed the peel of a waxen apple . And then I used to say in fun , as the children do , '
272575	272781	272564	272564	I	0	' Now Ruth looked very grave indeed , upon hearing of this my enterprise ; and crying , said she could almost cry , for the sake of my dear mother . Did I know the risks and chances , not of the battlefield alone , but of the havoc afterwards ; the swearing away of innocent lives , and the hurdle , and the hanging ? And if I would please not to laugh which was so unkind of me , had I never heard of imprisonments , and torturing with the cruel boot , and selling into slavery , where the sun and the lash outvied one another in cutting a man to pieces ? I replied that of all these things I had heard , and would take especial care to steer me free of all of them . My duty was all that I wished to do ; and none could harm me for doing that . And I begged my cousin to give me good - speed , instead of talking dolefully . Upon this she changed her manner wholly , becoming so lively and cheerful that I was convinced of her indifference , and surprised even more than gratified . '

276350	276369	276622	276622	you	7204	' shouted one big fellow , a miner of the Mendip hills , whose weapon was a pickaxe : '
276385	276620	276378	276378	thee	0	' Upon this I stopped my horse , desiring not to be shot for nothing ; and eager to aid some poor sick people , who tried to lift their arms to me . And this I did to the best of my power , though void of skill in the business ; and more inclined to weep with them than to check their weeping . While I was giving a drop of cordial from my flask to one poor fellow , who sat up , while his life was ebbing , and with slow insistence urged me , when his broken voice would come , to tell his wife whose name I knew not something about an apple - tree , and a golden guinea stored in it , to divide among six children in the midst of this I felt warm lips laid against my cheek quite softly , and then a little push ; and behold it was a horse leaning over me ! I arose in haste , and there stood Winnie , looking at me with beseeching eyes , enough to melt a heart of stone . Then seeing my attention fixed she turned her head , and glanced back sadly toward the place of battle , and gave a little wistful neigh : and then looked me full in the face again , as much as to say , '
276625	277291	276378	276378	thee	0	' while she scraped with one hoof impatiently . If ever a horse tried hard to speak , it was Winnie at that moment . I went to her side and patted her ; but that was not what she wanted . Then I offered to leap into the empty saddle ; but neither did that seem good to her : for she ran away toward the part of the field at which she had been glancing back , and then turned round , and shook her mane , entreating me to follow her . Upon this I learned from the dying man where to find his apple - tree , and promised to add another guinea to the one in store for his children ; and so , commending him to God , I mounted my own horse again , and to Winnie 's great delight , professed myself at her service . With her ringing silvery neigh , such as no other horse of all I ever knew could equal , she at once proclaimed her triumph , and told her master or meant to tell , if death should not have closed his ears that she was coming to his aid , and bringing one who might be trusted , of the higher race that kill . A cannon - bullet fired low , and ploughing the marsh slowly met poor Winnie front to front ; and she , being as quick as thought , lowered her nose to sniff at it . It might be a message from her master ; for it made a mournful noise . But luckily for Winnie 's life , a rise of wet ground took the ball , even under her very nose ; and there it cut a splashy groove , missing her off hindfoot by an inch , and scattering black mud over her . It frightened me much more than Winnie ; of that I am quite certain : because though I am firm enough , when it comes to a real tussle , and the heart of a fellow warms up and tells him that he must go through with it ; yet I never did approve of making a cold pie of death . Therefore , with those reckless cannons , brazen - mouthed , and bellowing , two furlongs off , or it might be more and the more the merrier , I would have given that year 's hay - crop for a bit of a hill , or a thicket of oaks , or almost even a badger 's earth . People will call me a coward for this especially when I had made up my mind , that life was not worth having without any sign of Lorna ; nevertheless , I can not help it : those were my feelings ; and I set them down , because they made a mark on me . At Glen Doone I had fought , even against cannon , with some spirit and fury : but now I saw nothing to fight about ; but rather in every poor doubled corpse , a good reason for not fighting . So , in cold blood riding on , and yet ashamed that a man should shrink where a horse went bravely , I cast a bitter blame upon the reckless ways of Winnie . Nearly all were scattered now . Of the noble countrymen armed with scythe or pickaxe , blacksmith 's hammer , or fold - pitcher , who had stood their ground for hours against blazing musketry from men whom they could not get at , by reason of the water - dyke , and then against the deadly cannon , dragged by the Bishop 's horses to slaughter his own sheep ; of these sturdy Englishmen , noble in their want of sense , scarce one out of four remained for the cowards to shoot down . '
277296	277301	276378	276378	thee	0	' they shouted out , '
277311	277619	276378	276378	thee	0	' but the other mongrel Britons , with a mongrel at their head , found it pleasanter to shoot men who could not shoot in answer , than to meet the chance of mischief from strong arms , and stronger hearts . The last scene of this piteous play was acting , just as I rode up . Broad daylight , and upstanding sun , winnowing fog from the eastern hills , and spreading the moors with freshness ; all along the dykes they shone , glistened on the willow - trunks , and touched the banks with a hoary gray . But alas ! those banks were touched more deeply with a gory red , and strewn with fallen trunks , more woeful than the wreck of trees ; while howling , cursing , yelling , and the loathsome reek of carnage , drowned the scent of the new - mown hay , and the carol of the lark . Then the cavalry of the King , with their horses at full speed , dashed from either side upon the helpless mob of countrymen . A few pikes feebly levelled met them ; but they shot the pikemen , drew swords , and helter - skelter leaped into the shattered and scattering mass . Right and left they hacked and hewed ; I could hear the snapping of scythes beneath them , and see the flash of their sweeping swords . How it must end was plain enough , even to one like myself , who had never beheld such a battle before . But Winnie led me away to the left ; and as I could not help the people , neither stop the slaughter , but found the cannon - bullets coming very rudely nigh me , I was only too glad to follow her .

With a strong sash , from his own hot neck , bound and twisted , tight as wax , around his damaged waist , I set him upon Winnie 's back , and placed his trembling feet in stirrups , with a band from one to another , under the good mare 's body ; so that no swerve could throw him out : and then I said , '
278516	278571	278506	278506	Tom	262	' He leaned almost on the neck of the mare , which , as I knew , must close the wound ; and the light of his eyes was quite different , and the pain of his forehead unstrung itself , as if he felt the undulous readiness of her volatile paces under him . '

Moreover , the linhay itself was full of very ancient cow dung ; than which there is no balmier and more maiden soporific . Hence I resolved , upon the whole , though grieving about breakfast , to light a pipe , and go to sleep ; or at least until the hot sun should arouse the flies . I may have slept three hours , or four , or it might be even five for I never counted time , while sleeping when a shaking more rude than the old landlady 's , brought me back to the world again .

279146	279337	279125	279125	you	7228	' For I disliked these men sincerely , and was fain to teach them a lesson ; they were so unchristian in appearance , having faces of a coffee colour , and dirty beards half over them . Moreover their dress was outrageous , and their address still worse . However , I had wiser let them alone , as will appear afterwards . These savage - looking fellows laughed at the idea of my having any chance against some twenty of them : but I knew that the place was in my favour ; for my part of it had been fenced off for weaning a calf most likely , so that only two could come at me at once ; and I must be very much out of training , if I could not manage two of them . Therefore I laid aside my carbine , and the two horse - pistols ; and they with many coarse jokes at me went a little way outside , and set their weapons against the wall , and turned up their coat sleeves jauntily ; and then began to hesitate . '
279344	279350	279339	279339	you	7233	' I heard them say : '
279375	279376	279367	279367	Us	7235	' '

279420	279956	279411	279412	every man	975	' Then he , and another man , made a rush , and the others came double - quick - march on their heels . But as Bob ran at me most stupidly , not even knowing how to place his hands , I caught him with my knuckles at the back of his neck , and with all the sway of my right arm sent him over the heads of his comrades . Meanwhile Dick the wrestler had grappled me , expecting to show off his art , of which indeed he had some small knowledge ; but being quite of the light - weights , in a second he was flying after his companion Bob . Now these two men were hurt so badly , the light one having knocked his head against the lintel of the outer gate , that the rest had no desire to encounter the like misfortune . So they hung back whispering ; and before they had made up their minds , I rushed into the midst of them . The suddenness and the weight of my onset took them wholly by surprise ; and for once in their lives , perhaps , Kirke 's lambs were worthy of their name . Like a flock of sheep at a dog 's attack they fell away , hustling one another , and my only difficulty was not to tumble over them . I had taken my carbine out with me , having a fondness for it ; but the two horse - pistols I left behind ; and therefore felt good title to take two from the magazine of the lambs . And with these , and my carbine , I leaped upon Kickums , who was now quite glad of a gallop again ; and I bade adieu to that mongrel lot ; yet they had the meanness to shoot at me . Thanking God for my deliverance inasmuch as those men would have strung me up , from a pollard - ash without trial , as I heard them tell one another , and saw the tree they had settled upon , I ventured to go rather fast on my way , with doubt and uneasiness urging me . And now my way was home again . Nobody could say but what I had done my duty , and rescued Tom if he could be rescued from the mischief into which his own perverseness and love of change rather than deep religious convictions , to which our Annie ascribed his outbreak had led , or seemed likely to lead him . And how proud would my mother be ; and ah well , there was nobody else to be proud of me now . But while thinking these things , and desiring my breakfast , beyond any power of describing , and even beyond my remembrance , I fell into another fold of lambs , from which there was no exit . These , like true crusaders , met me , swaggering very heartily , and with their barrels of cider set , like so many cannon , across the road , over against a small hostel . '
279990	279991	279992	279993	No rebel	6869	' '
280017	280639	280012	280012	I	0	' These fellows were truly hospitable ; that much will I say for them . Being accustomed to Arab ways , they could toss a grill , or fritter , or the inner meaning of an egg , into any form they pleased , comely and very good to eat ; and it led me to think of Annie . So I made the rarest breakfast any man might hope for , after all his troubles ; and getting on with these brown fellows better than could be expected , I craved permission to light a pipe , if not disagreeable . Hearing this , they roared at me , with a superior laughter , and asked me , whether or not , I knew the tobacco - leaf from the chick - weed ; and when I was forced to answer no , not having gone into the subject , but being content with anything brown , they clapped me on the back and swore they had never seen any one like me . Upon the whole this pleased me much ; for I do not wish to be taken always as of the common pattern : and so we smoked admirable tobacco for they would not have any of mine , though very courteous concerning it and I was beginning to understand a little of what they told me ; when up came those confounded lambs , who had shown more tail than head to me , in the linhay , as I mentioned . Now these men upset everything . Having been among wrestlers so much as my duty compelled me to be , and having learned the necessity of the rest which follows the conflict , and the right of discussion which all people have to pay their sixpence to enter ; and how they obtrude this right , and their wisdom , upon the man who has laboured , until he forgets all the work he did , and begins to think that they did it ; having some knowledge of this sort of thing , and the flux of minds swimming in liquor , I foresaw a brawl , as plainly as if it were Bear Street in Barnstaple . And a brawl there was , without any error , except of the men who hit their friends , and those who defended their enemies . My partners in breakfast and beer - can swore that I was no prisoner , but the best and most loyal subject , and the finest - hearted fellow they had ever the luck to meet with . Whereas the men from the linhay swore that I was a rebel miscreant ; and have me they would , with a rope's - end ready , in spite of every violent language who had got drunk at my expense , and been misled by my strong word lies . While this fight was going on and its mere occurrence shows , perhaps , that my conversation in those days was not entirely despicable else why should my new friends fight for me , when I had paid for the ale , and therefore won the wrong tense of gratitude ? it was in my power at any moment to take horse and go . And this would have been my wisest plan , and a very great saving of money ; but somehow I felt as if it would be a mean thing to slip off so . Even while I was hesitating , and the men were breaking each other 's heads , a superior officer rode up , with his sword drawn , and his face on fire . '
280648	280660	280642	280643	my lambs	7244	' he cried , smiting with the flat of his sword ; '

280728	280744	280720	280720	My	0	' I answered ; while the lambs fell back , and glowered at one another : '

280800	281551	280794	280794	thou	7252	' Colonel Kirke made a sign to his men , and before I could think of resistance , stout new ropes were flung around me ; and with three men on either side I was led along very painfully . And now I saw , and repented deeply of my careless folly , in stopping with those boon - companions , instead of being far away . But the newness of their manners to me , and their mode of regarding the world differing so much from mine own , as well as the flavour of their tobacco , had made me quite forget my duty to the farm and to myself . Yet methought they would be tender to me , after all our speeches : how then was I disappointed , when the men who had drunk my beer , drew on those grievous ropes , twice as hard as the men I had been at strife with ! Yet this may have been from no ill will ; but simply that having fallen under suspicion of laxity , they were compelled , in self - defence , now to be over - zealous . Nevertheless , however pure and godly might be their motives , I beheld myself in a grievous case , and likely to get the worst of it . For the face of the Colonel was hard and stern as a block of bogwood oak ; and though the men might pity me and think me unjustly executed , yet they must obey their orders , or themselves be put to death . Therefore I addressed myself to the Colonel , in a most ingratiating manner ; begging him not to sully the glory of his victory , and dwelling upon my pure innocence , and even good service to our lord the King . But Colonel Kirke only gave command that I should be smitten in the mouth ; which office Bob , whom I had flung so hard out of the linhay , performed with great zeal and efficiency . But being aware of the coming smack , I thrust forth a pair of teeth ; upon which the knuckles of my good friend made a melancholy shipwreck . It is not in my power to tell half the thoughts that moved me , when we came to the fatal tree , and saw two men hanging there already , as innocent perhaps as I was , and henceforth entirely harmless . Though ordered by the Colonel to look steadfastly upon them , I could not bear to do so ; upon which he called me a paltry coward , and promised my breeches to any man who would spit upon my countenance . This vile thing Bob , being angered perhaps by the smarting wound of his knuckles , bravely stepped forward to do for me , trusting no doubt to the rope I was led with . But , unluckily as it proved for him , my right arm was free for a moment ; and therewith I dealt him such a blow , that he never spake again . For this thing I have often grieved ; but the provocation was very sore to the pride of a young man ; and I trust that God has forgiven me . At the sound and sight of that bitter stroke , the other men drew back ; and Colonel Kirke , now black in the face with fury and vexation , gave orders for to shoot me , and cast me into the ditch hard by . The men raised their pieces , and pointed at me , waiting for the word to fire ; and I , being quite overcome by the hurry of these events , and quite unprepared to die yet , could only think all upside down about Lorna , and my mother , and wonder what each would say to it . I spread my hands before my eyes , not being so brave as some men ; and hoping , in some foolish way , to cover my heart with my elbows . I heard the breath of all around , as if my skull were a sounding - board ; and knew even how the different men were fingering their triggers . And a cold sweat broke all over me , as the Colonel , prolonging his enjoyment , began slowly to say , '
281554	281563	280794	280794	thou	7252	' But while he was yet dwelling on the '
281566	281664	280794	280794	thou	7252	' the hoofs of a horse dashed out on the road , and horse and horseman flung themselves betwixt me and the gun muzzles . So narrowly was I saved that one man could not check his trigger : his musket went off , and the ball struck the horse on the withers , and scared him exceedingly . He began to lash out with his heels all around , and the Colonel was glad to keep clear of him ; and the men made excuse to lower their guns , not really wishing to shoot me . '
281671	281685	281687	281687	you	564	' cried Kirke , the more angry because he had shown his cowardice ; '
281700	281701	281687	281687	you	564	' '
281710	281733	281708	281708	Colonel	4307	' replied my old friend Jeremy ; and his damaged voice was the sweetest sound I had heard for many a day ; '
281741	281817	281735	281735	your	564	' He looked so full of momentous tidings , that Colonel Kirke made a sign to his men not to shoot me till further orders ; and then he went aside with Stickles , so that in spite of all my anxiety I could not catch what passed between them . But I fancied that the name of the Lord Chief - Justice Jeffreys was spoken more than once , and with emphasis and deference . '
281829	281864	281826	281827	Captain Stickles	564	' said Kirke at last , so that all might hear him ; and though the news was good for me , the smile of baffled malice made his dark face look most hideous ; '
281878	281879	281880	281881	Colonel Kirke	598	' '
281889	281906	281883	281883	I	0	' Master Stickles replied , with a grave bow , and one hand on his breast : '
281921	282035	281918	281919	John Ridd	261	' Upon that , those precious lambs flocked away , leaving the rope still around me ; and some were glad , and some were sorry , not to see me swinging . Being free of my arms again , I touched my hat to Colonel Kirke , as became his rank and experience ; but he did not condescend to return my short salutation , having espied in the distance a prisoner , out of whom he might make money . I wrung the hand of Jeremy Stickles , for his truth and goodness ; and he almost wept for since his wound he had been a weakened man as he answered , '

Now he may not be quite so savage perhaps as Colonel Kirke , nor find so much sport in gibbeting ; but he is equally pitiless , and his price no doubt would be higher . '
282450	282458	282459	282459	I	0	' I will pay no price whatever , '
282462	282587	282459	282459	I	0	' neither will I fly . An hour agone I would have fled for the sake of my mother , and the farm . But now that I have been taken prisoner , and my name is known , if I fly , the farm is forfeited ; and my mother and sister must starve . Moreover , I have done no harm ; I have borne no weapons against the King , nor desired the success of his enemies . I like not that the son of a bona - roba should be King of England ; neither do I count the Papists any worse than we are . If they have aught to try me for , I will stand my trial . '

But quicken thy step , good John ; I have influence with Lord Churchill , and we must contrive to see him , ere the foreigner falls to work again . Lord Churchill is a man of sense , and imprisons nothing but his money . '

284387	284632	284634	284634	you	7351	' Such behaviour might be comely in a love - lorn boy , a page to some grand princess ; but I , John Ridd , would never stoop to the lowering of love so . Nevertheless I heard of Lorna , from my worthy furrier , almost every day , and with a fine exaggeration . This honest man was one of those who in virtue of their trade , and nicety of behaviour , are admitted into noble life , to take measurements , and show patterns . And while so doing , they contrive to acquire what is to the English mind at once the most important and most interesting of all knowledge , the science of being able to talk about the titled people . So my furrier whose name was Ramsack , having to make robes for peers , and cloaks for their wives and otherwise , knew the great folk , sham or real , as well as he knew a fox or skunk from a wolverine skin . And when , with some fencing and foils of inquiry , I hinted about Lady Lorna Dugal , the old man 's face became so pleasant that I knew her birth must be wondrous high . At this my own countenance fell , I suppose , for the better she was born , the harder she would be to marry and mistaking my object , he took me up : '

285100	285101	285095	285095	they	7374	' '
285109	285117	285095	285095	they	7374	' I replied , with equal confidence : '
285135	286433	285127	285127	they	7374	' For I knew a little about grubs , and the ignorance concerning them , which we have no right to put up with . However , not to go into that for the argument lasted a fortnight ; and then was only come so far as to begin again , Master Ramsack soon convinced me of the things I knew already ; the excellence of Lorna 's birth , as well as her lofty place at Court , and beauty , and wealth , and elegance . But all these only made me sigh , and wish that I were born to them . From Master Ramsack I discovered that the nobleman to whose charge Lady Lorna had been committed , by the Court of Chancery , was Earl Brandir of Lochawe , her poor mother 's uncle . For the Countess of Dugal was daughter , and only child , of the last Lord Lorne , whose sister had married Sir Ensor Doone ; while he himself had married the sister of Earl Brandir . This nobleman had a country house near the village of Kensington ; and here his niece dwelled with him , when she was not in attendance on Her Majesty the Queen , who had taken a liking to her . Now since the King had begun to attend the celebration of mass , in the chapel at Whitehall and not at Westminster Abbey , as our gossips had averred he had given order that the doors should be thrown open , so that all who could make interest to get into the antechamber , might see this form of worship . Master Ramsack told me that Lorna was there almost every Sunday ; their Majesties being most anxious to have the presence of all the nobility of the Catholic persuasion , so as to make a goodly show . And the worthy furrier , having influence with the door - keepers , kindly obtained admittance for me , one Sunday , into the antechamber . Here I took care to be in waiting , before the Royal procession entered ; but being unknown , and of no high rank , I was not allowed to stand forward among the better people , but ordered back into a corner very dark and dismal ; the verger remarking , with a grin , that I could see over all other heads , and must not set my own so high . Being frightened to find myself among so many people of great rank and gorgeous apparel , I blushed at the notice drawn upon me by this uncourteous fellow ; and silently fell back into the corner by the hangings . You may suppose that my heart beat high , when the King and Queen appeared , and entered , followed by the Duke of Norfolk , bearing the sword of state , and by several other noblemen , and people of repute . Then the doors of the chapel were thrown wide open ; and though I could only see a little , being in the corner so , I thought that it was beautiful . Bowers of rich silk were there , and plenty of metal shining , and polished wood with lovely carving ; flowers too of the noblest kind , and candles made by somebody who had learned how to clarify tallow . This last thing amazed me more than all , for our dips never will come clear , melt the mutton - fat how you will . And methought that this hanging of flowers about was a pretty thing ; for if a man can worship God best of all beneath a tree , as the natural instinct is , surely when by fault of climate the tree would be too apt to drip , the very best make - believe is to have enough and to spare of flowers ; which to the dwellers in London seem to have grown on the tree denied them . Be that as it may , when the King and Queen crossed the threshold , a mighty flourish of trumpets arose , and a waving of banners . The Knights of the Garter whoever they be were to attend that day in state ; and some went in , and some stayed out , and it made me think of the difference betwixt the ewes and the wethers . For the ewes will go wherever you lead them ; but the wethers will not , having strong opinions , and meaning to abide by them . And one man I noticed was of the wethers , to wit the Duke of Norfolk ; who stopped outside with the sword of state , like a beadle with a rapping - rod . This has taken more to tell than the time it happened in . For after all the men were gone , some to this side , some to that , according to their feelings , a number of ladies , beautifully dressed , being of the Queen 's retinue , began to enter , and were stared at three times as much as the men had been . And indeed they were worth looking at which men never are to my ideas , when they trick themselves with gewgaws , but none was so well worth eye - service as my own beloved Lorna . She entered modestly and shyly , with her eyes upon the ground , knowing the rudeness of the gallants , and the large sum she was priced at . Her dress was of the purest white , very sweet and simple , without a line of ornament , for she herself adorned it . The way she walked , and touched her skirt rather than seemed to hold it up with a white hand beaming one red rose , this and her stately supple neck , and the flowing of her hair would show , at a distance of a hundred yards , that she could be none but Lorna Doone . Lorna Doone of my early love ; in the days when she blushed for her name before me by reason of dishonesty ; but now the Lady Lorna Dugal as far beyond reproach as above my poor affection . All my heart , and all my mind , gathered themselves upon her . Would she see me , or would she pass ? Was there instinct in our love ? By some strange chance she saw me . Or was it through our destiny ? While with eyes kept sedulously on the marble floor , to shun the weight of admiration thrust too boldly on them , while with shy quick steps she passed , some one perhaps with purpose trod on the skirt of her clear white dress , with the quickness taught her by many a scene of danger , she looked up , and her eyes met mine . As I gazed upon her , steadfastly , yearningly , yet with some reproach , and more of pride than humility , she made me one of the courtly bows which I do so much detest ; yet even that was sweet and graceful , when my Lorna did it . But the colour of her pure clear cheeks was nearly as deep as that of my own , when she went on for the religious work . And the shining of her eyes was owing to an unpaid debt of tears . Upon the whole I was satisfied . Lorna had seen me , and had not according to the phrase of the high world then even tried to '
286435	286483	287160	287160	LORNA	561	' me . Whether this low phrase is born of their own stupid meanness , or whether it comes of necessity exercised on a man without money , I know not , and I care not . But one thing I know right well ; any man who '
286485	286719	285127	285127	they	7374	' a man except for vice or meanness should be quartered without quarter . All these proud thoughts rose within me as the lovely form of Lorna went inside , and was no more seen . And then I felt how coarse I was ; how apt to think strong thoughts , and so on ; without brains to bear me out : even as a hen 's egg , laid without enough of lime , and looking only a poor jelly . Nevertheless , I waited on ; as my usual manner is . For to be beaten , while running away , is ten times worse than to face it out , and take it , and have done with it . So at least I have always found , because of reproach of conscience : and all the things those clever people carried on inside , at large , made me long for our Parson Bowden that he might know how to act . While I stored up , in my memory , enough to keep our parson going through six pipes on a Saturday night to have it as right as could be next day a lean man with a yellow beard , too thin for a good Catholic which religion always fattens , came up to me , working sideways , in the manner of a female crab . '
286727	286731	285127	285127	they	7374	' I said : '
286748	286961	286741	286741	they	7377	' Nothing had this man to say ; but with many sighs , because I was not of the proper faith , he took my reprobate hand to save me : and with several religious tears , looked up at me , and winked with one eye . Although the skin of my palms was thick , I felt a little suggestion there , as of a gentle leaf in spring , fearing to seem too forward . I paid the man , and he went happy ; for the standard of heretical silver is purer than that of the Catholics . Then I lifted up my little billet ; and in that dark corner read it , with a strong rainbow of colours coming from the angled light . And in mine eyes there was enough to make rainbow of strongest sun , as my anger clouded off . Not that it began so well ; but that in my heart I knew ere three lines were through me that I was with all heart loved and beyond that , who may need ? The darling of my life went on , as if I were of her own rank , or even better than she was ; and she dotted her '
286965	286969	286741	286741	they	7377	' and crossed her '
286973	287154	286741	286741	they	7377	' as if I were at least a schoolmaster . All of it was done in pencil ; but as plain as plain could be . In my coffin it shall lie , with my ring and something else . Therefore will I not expose it to every man who buys this book , and haply thinks that he has bought me to the bottom of my heart . Enough for men of gentle birth who never are inquisitive that my love told me , in her letter , just to come and see her . I ran away , and could not stop . To behold even her , at the moment , would have dashed my fancy 's joy . Yet my brain was so amiss , that I must do something . Therefore to the river Thames , with all speed , I hurried ; and keeping all my best clothes on indued for sake of Lorna , into the quiet stream I leaped , and swam as far as London Bridge , and ate nobler dinner afterwards .

288048	288108	288040	288040	she	561	' Master John Ridd , you shall tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . I have been in Chancery , sir ; and can detect a story . Now why have you never , for more than a twelvemonth , taken the smallest notice of your old friend , Mistress Lorna Doone ? '
288141	288150	288137	288137	her	561	' Simply for this cause , I answered , '
288175	288176	288169	288169	I	0	' '
288179	288253	288169	288169	I	0	' cried Lorna ; and nothing more ; being overcome with wondering ; and much inclined to fall away , but for my assistance . I told her , over and over again , that not a single syllable of any message from her , or tidings of her welfare , had reached me , or any one of us , since the letter she left behind ; except by soldier 's gossip . '
288261	288272	288169	288169	I	0	' said Lorna , sighing at thought of my misery : '
288324	288325	288311	288312	Mistress Ruth	432	' '
288333	288340	288342	288342	she	348	' I answered with some dignity ; '
288378	288379	288375	288376	Lady Lorna	561	' '
288387	288391	288381	288381	Ruth	348	' she answered , '
288471	288538	288453	288453	she	7415	' With these words , she moved an implement such as I had not seen before , and which made a ringing noise at a serious distance . And before I had ceased wondering for if such things go on , we might ring the church bells , while sitting in our back - kitchen little Gwenny Carfax came , with a grave and sullen face . '
288541	288555	288453	288453	she	7415	' began my Lorna , in a tone of high rank and dignity , '

288609	288631	288604	288604	you	393	' I asked , very sternly ; for the matter was no joke to me , after a year 's unhappiness . '
288639	288660	288661	288661	I	0	' ee . What should I look at a young man for , although he did offer to kiss me ? '
288686	288697	288699	288699	Lorna	561	' Now , Gwenny , not to speak of that , '
288704	288723	288699	288699	Lorna	561	' if you thought it honest to keep the letters , was it honest to keep the money ? '

288783	288836	288772	288772	Lorna	561	' if it is not honest to keep the money , it is not honest to keep the letters , which would have been worth more than any gold to those who were so kind to you . Your father shall know the whole , Gwenny , unless you tell the truth . '
288837	288847	288848	288850	this strange maiden	7421	' Now , a will tell all the truth , '
288917	288924	288926	288926	Lorna	561	' I trusted her so much , '
288936	288973	288929	288929	her	561	' and look how she has deceived me ! That is why I love you , John setting other things aside , because you never told me falsehood ; and you never could , you know . '
288974	289003	288929	288929	her	561	' Well , I am not so sure of that . I think I could tell any lie , to have you , darling , all my own . '
289004	289043	288929	288929	her	561	' Yes . And perhaps it might be right . To other people besides us two . But you could not do it to me , John . You never could do it to me , you know . '
289093	289103	289105	289105	Lorna	561	' Go , and get your letters , John , '
289109	289136	289105	289105	Lorna	561	' or at least your mother 's letters , made of messages to you . As for Gwenny , she shall go before Lord Justice Jeffreys . '
289200	289248	289171	289171	She	11148	' And you may take me , if you please , before the great Lord Jeffreys . I have done no more than duty , though I did it crookedly , and told a heap of lies , for your sake . And pretty gratitude I gets . '
289249	289256	289258	289258	Lorna	561	' Much gratitude you have shown , '
289260	289315	289258	289258	Lorna	561	' to Master Ridd , for all his kindness and his goodness to you . Who was it that went down , at the peril of his life , and brought your father to you , when you had lost him for months and months ? Who was it ? Answer me , Gwenny ? '

289329	289340	289341	289341	I	0	' What made you treat me so , little Gwenny ? '
289356	289358	289345	289345	Lorna	561	' Because '

289418	289442	289443	289443	she	561	' and remember that you come not near me for the next three days . It is the only way to punish her , '
289462	289519	289443	289443	she	561	' Now , for the next three days , she will scarcely touch a morsel of food , and scarcely do a thing but cry . Make up your mind to one thing , John ; if you mean to take me , for better for worse , you will have to take Gwenny with me . '
289528	289532	289520	289520	I	0	' said I , '

289569	289774	289560	289561	No one	821	' she answered very softly ; and I was better pleased with this , than if she had called me the most noble and glorious man in the kingdom . After this , we spoke of ourselves and the way people would regard us , supposing that when Lorna came to be her own free mistress as she must do in the course of time she were to throw her rank aside , and refuse her title , and caring not a fig for folk who cared less than a fig - stalk for her , should shape her mind to its native bent , and to my perfect happiness . It was not my place to say much , lest I should appear to use an improper and selfish influence . And of course to all men of common sense , and to everybody of middle age who must know best what is good for youth , the thoughts which my Lorna entertained would be enough to prove her madness . Not that we could not keep her well , comfortably , and with nice clothes , and plenty of flowers , and fruit , and landscape , and the knowledge of our neighbours '
289892	289900	289911	289911	she	7435	' How will my love be happiest ? '
289901	289906	289907	289907	she	7435	' Now , John , '
289923	290054	289911	289911	she	7435	' why will you be backward , as if you cared not for me ? Do you dream that I am doubting ? My mind has been made up , good John , that you must be my husband , for well , I will not say how long , lest you should laugh at my folly . But I believe it was ever since you came , with your stockings off , and the loaches . Right early for me to make up my mind ; but you know that you made up yours , John ; and , of course , I knew it ; and that had a great effect on me . Now , after all this age of loving , shall a trifle sever us ? '
290200	290288	290191	290191	she	7441	' I think that condition should rather have proceeded from me . You are mistaken , Master Ridd , in supposing that I would think of receiving you in secret . It was a different thing in Glen Doone , where all except yourself were thieves , and when I was but a simple child , and oppressed with constant fear . You are quite right in threatening to visit me thus no more ; but I think you might have waited for an invitation , sir . '
290289	290322	290324	290324	I	0	' And you are quite right , Lady Lorna , in pointing out my presumption . It is a fault that must ever be found in any speech of mine to you . '
290367	290386	290388	290388	she	7447	' Now , will you allow me just to explain my own view of this matter , John ? '
290395	290632	290388	290388	she	7447	' It may be a very foolish view , but I shall never change it . Please not to interrupt me , dear , until you have heard me to the end . In the first place , it is quite certain that neither you nor I can be happy without the other . Then what stands between us ? Worldly position , and nothing else . I have no more education than you have , John Ridd ; nay , and not so much . My birth and ancestry are not one whit more pure than yours , although they may be better known . Your descent from ancient freeholders , for five - and - twenty generations of good , honest men , although you bear no coat of arms , is better than the lineage of nine proud English noblemen out of every ten I meet with . In manners , though your mighty strength , and hatred of any meanness , sometimes break out in violence of which I must try to cure you , dear in manners , if kindness , and gentleness , and modesty are the true things wanted , you are immeasurably above any of our Court - gallants ; who indeed have very little . As for difference of religion , we allow for one another , neither having been brought up in a bitterly pious manner . '
290694	290820	290685	290685	her	561	' Now , you see , I have proved my point ; there is nothing between us but worldly position if you can defend me against the Doones , for which , I trow , I may trust you . And worldly position means wealth , and title , and the right to be in great houses , and the pleasure of being envied . I have not been here for a year , John , without learning something . Oh , I hate it ; how I hate it ! Of all the people I know , there are but two , besides my uncle , who do not either covet , or detest me . And who are those two , think you ? '
290821	290827	290828	290828	I	0	' Gwenny , for one , '
290831	290968	290685	290685	her	561	' Yes , Gwenny , for one . And the queen , for the other . The one is too far below me I mean , in her own opinion , and the other too high above . As for the women who dislike me , without having even heard my voice , I simply have nothing to do with them . As for the men who covet me , for my land and money , I merely compare them with you , John Ridd ; and all thought of them is over . Oh , John , you must never forsake me , however cross I am to you . I thought you would have gone , just now ; and though I would not move to stop you , my heart would have broken . '
290969	290980	290981	290981	I	0	' You do n't catch me go in a hurry , '
290986	291021	290981	290981	I	0	' when the loveliest maiden in all the world , and the best , and the dearest , loves me . All my fear of you is gone , darling Lorna , all my fear '
291022	291158	290685	290685	her	561	' Is it possible you could fear me , John , after all we have been through together ? Now you promised not to interrupt me ; is this fair behaviour ? Well , let me see where I left off oh , that my heart would have broken . Upon that point , I will say no more , lest you should grow conceited , John ; if anything could make you so . But I do assure you that half London however , upon that point also I will check my power of speech , lest you think me conceited . And now to put aside all nonsense ; though I have talked none for a year , John , having been so unhappy ; and now it is such a relief to me '
291159	291167	291169	291169	I	0	' Then talk it for an hour , '
291171	291192	291169	291169	I	0	' and let me sit and watch you . To me it is the very sweetest of all sweetest wisdom . '
291193	291201	291202	291202	she	7452	' Nay , there is no time , '
291243	291294	291228	291228	she	7452	' My uncle will come home in less than half an hour , dear : and you are not the one to take a side - passage , and avoid him . I shall tell him that you have been here ; and that I mean you to come again . '
291414	291430	291407	291407	I	0	' Darling , do just what you please . Only make no rogue of me . '
291589	291606	291580	291580	she	683	' Ah , if our John would only come home , how different everything would look ! '
292275	292574	292687	292687	him	7488	' shoes was gone up again , though already twopence - farthing each ; and that Betty had broken her lover 's head with the stocking full of money ; and then in the corner it was written that the distinguished man of war , and worshipful scholar , Master Bloxham , was now promoted to take the tolls , and catch all the rebels around our part . Lorna was greatly pleased with the goose , and the butter , and the brandied cherries ; and the Earl Brandir himself declared that he never tasted better than those last , and would beg the young man from the country to procure him instructions for making them . This nobleman , being as deaf as a post , and of a very solid mind , could never be brought to understand the nature of my thoughts towards Lorna . He looked upon me as an excellent youth , who had rescued the maiden from the Doones , whom he cordially detested ; and learning that I had thrown two of them out of window as the story was told him , he patted me on the back , and declared that his doors would ever be open to me , and that I could not come too often . I thought this very kind of his lordship , especially as it enabled me to see my darling Lorna , not indeed as often as I wished , but at any rate very frequently , and as many times as modesty ever my leading principle would in common conscience approve of . And I made up my mind that if ever I could help Earl Brandir , it would be as we say , when with brandy and water the '
292581	292683	292684	292684	I	0	' when I could fulfil the pledge . And I soon was able to help Lord Brandir , as I think , in two different ways ; first of all as regarded his mind , and then as concerned his body : and the latter perhaps was the greatest service , at his time of life . But not to be too nice about that ; let me tell how these things were . Lorna said to me one day , being in a state of excitement whereto she was over prone , when reft of my slowness to steady her , '
292707	292751	292702	292702	me	0	' I thought that she meant all about our love , which we had endeavoured thrice to drill into his fine old ears ; but could not make him comprehend , without risk of bringing the house down : and so I said , '
292764	292785	292702	292702	me	0	' Lorna , however , looked at me for her eyes told more than tongue as much as to say , '
292801	292824	292825	292825	I	0	' And then she saw that I was vexed at my own want of quickness ; and so she spoke very kindly , '
292936	292937	292934	292934	John	274	' '
292940	292944	292934	292934	John	274	' said I , '
292994	292995	292988	292988	you	274	' '
293003	293017	292988	292988	you	274	' she answered , trying to make wrinkles in her pure bright forehead : '
293070	293071	293097	293097	his	7496	' '
293079	293095	293097	293097	his	7496	' said I , never being in a hurry , except when passion moves me , '
293115	293129	293132	293132	you	274	' This was not the first time we had spoken of the matter . '
293140	293149	293135	293135	John	274	' she answered , wondering at my coolness , '
293363	293364	293386	293386	he	7496	' '
293371	293384	293386	293386	he	7496	' I said ; for Lorna 's eyes were full of tears . '

293506	293514	293501	293501	you	7506	' I answered softly , but clearly , '
293535	293536	293486	293487	Alan Brandir	396	' '
293544	293548	293538	293538	you	274	' she replied : '
293572	293940	293566	293566	I	0	' The other way in which I managed to help the good Earl Brandir was of less true moment to him ; but as he could not know of the first , this was the one which moved him . And it happened pretty much as follows though I hardly like to tell , because it advanced me to such a height as I myself was giddy at ; and which all my friends resented greatly save those of my own family , and even now are sometimes bitter , in spite of all my humility . Now this is a matter of history , because the King was concerned in it ; and being so strongly misunderstood , especially in my own neighbourhood , I will overcome so far as I can my diffidence in telling it . The good Earl Brandir was a man of the noblest charity . True charity begins at home , and so did his ; and was afraid of losing the way , if it went abroad . So this good nobleman kept his money in a handsome pewter box , with his coat of arms upon it , and a double lid and locks . Moreover , there was a heavy chain , fixed to a staple in the wall , so that none might carry off the pewter with the gold inside of it . Lorna told me the box was full , for she had seen him go to it , and she often thought that it would be nice for us to begin the world with . I told her that she must not allow her mind to dwell upon things of this sort ; being wholly against the last commandment set up in our church at Oare . Now one evening towards September , when the days were drawing in , looking back at the house to see whether Lorna were looking after me , I espied by a little glimpse , as it were a pair of villainous fellows about whom there could be no mistake watching from the thicket - corner , some hundred yards or so behind the good Earl 's dwelling . '
293946	293965	293566	293566	I	0	' thought I to myself , being thoroughly conversant with theft , from my knowledge of the Doones ; '
293983	294304	294313	294317	some one inside the house	7515	' I found that neither moon nor watch could be looked for until the morning ; the moon , of course , before the watch , and more likely to be punctual . Therefore I resolved to wait , and see what those two villains did , and save if it were possible the Earl of Brandir 's pewter box . But inasmuch as those bad men were almost sure to have seen me leaving the house and looking back , and striking out on the London road , I marched along at a merry pace , until they could not discern me ; and then I fetched a compass round , and refreshed myself at a certain inn , entitled The Cross - bones and Buttons . Here I remained until it was very nearly as dark as pitch ; and the house being full of footpads and cutthroats , I thought it right to leave them . One or two came after me , in the hope of designing a stratagem ; but I dropped them in the darkness ; and knowing all the neighbourhood well , I took up my position , two hours before midnight , among the shrubs at the eastern end of Lord Brandir 's mansion . Hence , although I might not see , I could scarcely fail to hear , if any unlawful entrance either at back or front were made . From my own observation , I thought it likely that the attack would be in the rear ; and so indeed it came to pass . For when all the lights were quenched , and all the house was quiet , I heard a low and wily whistle from a clump of trees close by ; and then three figures passed between me and a whitewashed wall , and came to a window which opened into a part of the servants '
294339	294345	294346	294346	I	0	' Oh , you villains ! '
294351	294367	294346	294346	I	0	' this is worse than any Doone job ; because there is treachery in it . '

294984	295010	294968	294970	this aged Earl	7545	' I will give no key to you . It all belongs to my boy , Alan . No one else shall have a farthing . '

296286	296305	296240	296241	the King	8664	' but I could not remember the word , and feared to keep the King looking at me . '

296380	296405	296410	296411	Johann Reed	619	' Here he stopped , having gone rather far ! but the gleam of his heavy eyes was such that I durst not contradict . '
296413	296428	296410	296411	Johann Reed	619	' said Her Majesty , coming forward , because the King was in meditation ; '
296461	296487	296454	296454	she	7611	' I have tried to write it , as she said it : but it wants a better scholar to express her mode of speech . '
296493	296521	296490	296491	John Ridd	261	' said the King , recovering from his thoughts about the true Church , and thinking that his wife was not to take the lead upon me ; '

296696	296714	296691	296694	A very good lad	7624	' said the King , and he looked at the Queen , as if almost in joke ; '

But nothing was done to Grace Howe , of Bridgeball , who had been Wade 's greatest comforter ; neither was anything done to us ; although Eliza had added greatly to mother 's alarm and danger by falling upon Rector Powell , and most soundly rating him for his meanness , and his cruelty , and cowardice , as she called it , in setting men with firearms upon a poor helpless fugitive , and robbing all our neighbourhood of its fame for hospitality . However , by means of Sergeant Bloxham , and his good report of us , as well as by virtue of Wade 's confession which proved of use to the Government my mother escaped all penalties . It is likely enough that good folk will think it hard upon our neighbourhood to be threatened , and sometimes heavily punished , for kindness and humanity ; and yet to be left to help ourselves against tyranny , and base rapine . And now at last our gorge was risen , and our hearts in tumult . We had borne our troubles long , as a wise and wholesome chastisement ; quite content to have some few things of our own unmeddled with . But what could a man dare to call his own , or what right could he have to wish for it , while he left his wife and children at the pleasure of any stranger ? The people came flocking all around me , at the blacksmith 's forge , and the Brendon alehouse ; and I could scarce come out of church , but they got me among the tombstones . They all agreed that I was bound to take command and management . I bade them go to the magistrates , but they said they had been too often . Then I told them that I had no wits for ordering of an armament , although I could find fault enough with the one which had not succeeded . But they would hearken to none of this . All they said was '
301915	302270	301512	301514	J.R. John Birch	632	' This seemed to me to be common sense , and good stuff , instead of mere bragging ; moreover , I myself was moved by the bitter wrongs of Margery , having known her at the Sunday - school , ere ever I went to Tiverton ; and having in those days , serious thoughts of making her my sweetheart ; although she was three years my elder . But now I felt this difficulty the Doones had behaved very well to our farm , and to mother , and all of us , while I was away in London . Therefore , would it not be shabby , and mean , for me to attack them now ? Yet being pressed still harder and harder , as day by day the excitement grew with more and more talking over it , and no one else coming forward to undertake the business , I agreed at last to this ; that if the Doones , upon fair challenge , would not endeavour to make amends by giving up Mistress Margery , as well as the man who had slain the babe , then I would lead the expedition , and do my best to subdue them . All our men were content with this , being thoroughly well assured from experience , that the haughty robbers would only shoot any man who durst approach them with such proposal . And then arose a difficult question who was to take the risk of making overtures so unpleasant ? I waited for the rest to offer ; and as none was ready , the burden fell on me , and seemed to be of my own inviting . Hence I undertook the task , sooner than reason about it ; for to give the cause of everything is worse than to go through with it . It may have been three of the afternoon , when leaving my witnesses behind for they preferred the background I appeared with our Lizzie 's white handkerchief upon a kidney - bean stick , at the entrance to the robbers '

We are not in the habit of deserting anything that belongs to us ; far less our sacred relatives . The insolence of your demand well - nigh outdoes the ingratitude . If there be a man upon Exmoor who has grossly ill - used us , kidnapped our young women , and slain half a dozen of our young men , you are that outrageous rogue , Sir John . And after all this , how have we behaved ? We have laid no hand upon your farm , we have not carried off your women , we have even allowed you to take our Queen , by creeping and crawling treachery ; and we have given you leave of absence to help your cousin the highwayman , and to come home with a title . And now , how do you requite us ? By inflaming the boorish indignation at a little frolic of our young men ; and by coming with insolent demands , to yield to which would ruin us . Ah , you ungrateful viper ! '
303354	303485	303348	303348	I	0	' It is true that I owe you gratitude , sir , for a certain time of forbearance ; and it is to prove my gratitude that I am come here now . I do not think that my evil deeds can be set against your own ; although I can not speak flowingly upon my good deeds as you can . I took your Queen because you starved her , having stolen her long before , and killed her mother and brother . This is not for me to dwell upon now ; any more than I would say much about your murdering of my father . But how the balance hangs between us , God knows better than thou or I , thou low miscreant , Carver Doone . '

And as soon as we knew that this party of robbers , be it more or less , was out of hearing from the valley , we were to fall to , ostensibly at the Doone - gate which was impregnable now , but in reality upon their rear , by means of my old water - slide . For I had chosen twenty young fellows , partly miners , and partly warehousemen , and sheep farmers , and some of other vocations , but all to be relied upon for spirit and power of climbing . And with proper tools to aid us , and myself to lead the way , I felt no doubt whatever but that we could all attain the crest where first I had met with Lorna . Upon the whole , I rejoiced that Lorna was not present now . It must have been irksome to her feelings to have all her kindred and old associates much as she kept aloof from them put to death without ceremony , or else putting all of us to death . For all of us were resolved this time to have no more shilly - shallying ; but to go through with a nasty business , in the style of honest Englishmen , when the question comes to '
306142	306631	306635	306636	my lads	3394	' There was hardly a man among us who had not suffered bitterly from the miscreants now before us . One had lost his wife perhaps , another had lost a daughter according to their ages , another had lost his favourite cow ; in a word , there was scarcely any one who had not to complain of a hayrick ; and what surprised me then , not now , was that the men least injured made the greatest push concerning it . But be the wrong too great to speak of , or too small to swear about , from poor Kit Badcock to rich Master Huckaback , there was not one but went heart and soul for stamping out these firebrands . The moon was lifting well above the shoulder of the uplands , when we , the chosen band , set forth , having the short cut along the valleys to foot of the Bagworthy water ; and therefore having allowed the rest an hour , to fetch round the moors and hills ; we were not to begin our climb until we heard a musket fired from the heights on the left - hand side , where John Fry himself was stationed , upon his own and his wife 's request ; so as to keep out of action . And that was the place where I had been used to sit , and to watch for Lorna . And John Fry was to fire his gun , with a ball of wool inside it , so soon as he heard the hurly - burly at the Doone - gate beginning ; which we , by reason of waterfall , could not hear , down in the meadows there . We waited a very long time , with the moon marching up heaven steadfastly , and the white fog trembling in chords and columns , like a silver harp of the meadows . And then the moon drew up the fogs , and scarfed herself in white with them ; and so being proud , gleamed upon the water , like a bride at her looking - glass ; and yet there was no sound of either John Fry , or his blunderbuss . I began to think that the worthy John , being out of all danger , and having brought a counterpane according to his wife 's directions , because one of the children had a cold , must veritably have gone to sleep ; leaving other people to kill , or be killed , as might be the will of God ; so that he were comfortable . But herein I did wrong to John , and am ready to acknowledge it ; for suddenly the most awful noise that anything short of thunder could make , came down among the rocks , and went and hung upon the corners . '
306638	306669	306635	306636	my lads	3394	' I cried , leaping up and rubbing my eyes ; for even now , while condemning John unjustly , I was giving him right to be hard upon me . '

310448	310478	310171	310171	he	8152	' You shall go directly , Sir Counsellor , after meeting my other condition ; which is , that you place in my hands Lady Lorna 's diamond necklace . '

310527	310550	310171	310171	he	8152	' Then try to have it in your power , sir . Surely , with my encouragement , you might summon resolution . '
310551	310668	310669	310669	He	8156	' Alas , John , the resolution has been ready long ago . But the thing is not in my possession . Carver , my son , who slew your father , upon him you will find the necklace . What are jewels to me , young man , at my time of life ? Baubles and trash , I detest them , from the sins they have led me to answer for . When you come to my age , good Sir John , you will scorn all jewels , and care only for a pure and bright conscience . Ah ! ah ! Let me go . I have made my peace with God . '

There is one jewel I can look at for hours , and see all the lights of heaven in it ; which I never shall see elsewhere . All my wretched , wicked life oh , John , I am a sad hypocrite but give me back my jewels . Or else kill me here ; I am a babe in your hands ; but I must have back my jewels . '
311111	311181	311100	311100	I	0	' Sir Counsellor , I can not give you what does not belong to me . But if you will show me that particular diamond which is heaven to you , I will take upon myself the risk and the folly of cutting it out for you . And with that you must go contented ; and I beseech you not to starve with that jewel upon your lips . '

Not that I sought for Carver 's life , any more than I did for the Counsellor 's ; but that for us it was no light thing , to have a man of such power , and resource , and desperation , left at large and furious , like a famished wolf round the sheepfold . Yet greatly as I blamed the yeomen , who were posted on their horses , just out of shot from the Doone - gate , for the very purpose of intercepting those who escaped the miners , I could not get them to admit that any blame attached to them . But lo , he had dashed through the whole of them , with his horse at full gallop ; and was nearly out of shot before they began to think of shooting him . Then it appears from what a boy said for boys manage to be everywhere that Captain Carver rode through the Doone - gate , and so to the head of the valley . There , of course , he beheld all the houses , and his own among the number , flaming with a handsome blaze , and throwing a fine light around such as he often had revelled in , when of other people 's property . But he swore the deadliest of all oaths , and seeing himself to be vanquished so far as the luck of the moment went , spurred his great black horse away , and passed into the darkness .

Well , the ways of God were wonderful ! So they were , and so they are ; and so they ever will be . Let us debate them as we will , our ways are His , and much the same ; only second - hand from Him . And I expected something from Him , even in my worst of times , knowing that I had done my best . This is not edifying talk as our Nonconformist parson says , when he can get no more to drink therefore let me only tell what became of Lorna . One day , I was sitting in my bedroom , for I could not get downstairs , and there was no one strong enough to carry me , even if I would have allowed it . Though it cost me sore trouble and weariness , I had put on all my Sunday clothes , out of respect for the doctor , who was coming to bleed me again as he always did twice a week ; and it struck me that he had seemed hurt in his mind , because I wore my worst clothes to be bled in for lie in bed I would not , after six o'clock ; and even that was great laziness . I looked at my right hand , whose grasp had been like that of a blacksmith 's vice ; and it seemed to myself impossible that this could be John Ridd 's . The great frame of the hand was there , as well as the muscles , standing forth like the guttering of a candle , and the broad blue veins , going up the back , and crossing every finger . But as for colour , even Lorna 's could scarcely have been whiter ; and as for strength , little Ensie Doone might have come and held it fast . I laughed as I tried in vain to lift the basin set for bleeding me . Then I thought of all the lovely things going on out - of - doors just now , concerning which the drowsy song of the bees came to me . These must be among the thyme , by the sound of their great content . Therefore the roses must be in blossom , and the woodbine , and clove - gilly - flower ; the cherries on the wall must be turning red , the yellow Sally must be on the brook , wheat must be callow with quavering bloom , and the early meadows swathed with hay . Yet here was I , a helpless creature quite unfit to stir among them , gifted with no sight , no scent of all the changes that move our love , and lead our hearts , from month to month , along the quiet path of life . And what was worse , I had no hope of caring ever for them more . Presently a little knock sounded through my gloomy room , and supposing it to be the doctor , I tried to rise and make my bow . But to my surprise it was little Ruth , who had never once come to visit me , since I was placed under the doctor 's hands . Ruth was dressed so gaily , with rosettes , and flowers , and what not , that I was sorry for her bad manners ; and thought she was come to conquer me , now that Lorna was done with . Ruth ran towards me with sparkling eyes , being rather short of sight ; then suddenly she stopped , and I saw entire amazement in her face . '
321859	321863	321852	321852	they	8498	' she cried : '
321887	321888	321889	321889	I	0	' '

322031	322066	322067	322068	Dear cousin	11509	' I was surprised to see Ruth excited ; her character being so calm and quiet . And I tried to soothe her with my feeble hand , as now she knelt before me . '
322091	322092	322085	322085	he	4362	' '
322173	322174	322175	322175	You	11509	' '

322223	322232	322212	322212	she	561	' I said , falling back with bewilderment ; '

322250	322263	322275	322275	she	8975	' Ruth in great indignation more feigned , I doubt , than real '
322307	322349	322301	322301	you	11509	' If ever there was virtuous truth in the eyes of any woman , it was now in Ruth Huckaback 's : and my brain began very slowly to move , the heart being almost torpid from perpetual loss of blood . '

322420	322483	322410	322410	you	11509	' Following her , to the very utmost of my mind and heart , I felt that all she said was truth ; and yet I could not make it out . And in her last few words there was such a power of sadness rising through the cover of gaiety , that I said to myself , half in a dream , '
322489	323601	322484	322484	Ruth	348	' Before I had time to listen much for the approach of footsteps , Ruth came back , and behind her Lorna ; coy as if of her bridegroom ; and hanging back with her beauty . Ruth banged the door , and ran away ; and Lorna stood before me . But she did not stand for an instant , when she saw what I was like . At the risk of all thick bandages , and upsetting a dozen medicine bottles , and scattering leeches right and left , she managed to get into my arms , although they could not hold her . She laid her panting warm young breast on the place where they meant to bleed me , and she set my pale face up ; and she would not look at me , having greater faith in kissing . I felt my life come back , and warm ; I felt my trust in women flow ; I felt the joys of living now , and the power of doing it . It is not a moment to describe ; who feels can never tell of it . But the rush of Lorna 's tears , and the challenge of my bride 's lips , and the throbbing of my wife 's heart now at last at home on mine , made me feel that the world was good , and not a thing to be weary of . Little more have I to tell . The doctor was turned out at once ; and slowly came back my former strength , with a darling wife , and good victuals . As for Lorna , she never tired of sitting and watching me eat and eat . And such is her heart that she never tires of being with me here and there , among the beautiful places , and talking with her arm around me so far at least as it can go , though half of mine may go round her of the many fears and troubles , dangers and discouragements , and worst of all the bitter partings , which we used to have , somehow . There is no need for my farming harder than becomes a man of weight . Lorna has great stores of money , though we never draw it out , except for some poor neighbor ; unless I find her a sumptuous dress , out of her own perquisites . And this she always looks upon as a wondrous gift from me ; and kisses me much when she puts it on , and walks like the noble woman she is . And yet I may never behold it again ; for she gets back to her simple clothes , and I love her the better in them . I believe that she gives half the grandeur away , and keeps the other half for the children . As for poor Tom Faggus , every one knows his bitter adventures , when his pardon was recalled , because of his journey to Sedgemoor . Not a child in the country , I doubt , but knows far more than I do of Tom 's most desperate doings . The law had ruined him once , he said ; and then he had been too much for the law : and now that a quiet life was his object , here the base thing came after him . And such was his dread of this evil spirit , that being caught upon Barnstaple Bridge , with soldiers at either end of it yet doubtful about approaching him , he set his strawberry mare , sweet Winnie , at the left - hand parapet , with a whisper into her dove - coloured ear . Without a moment 's doubt she leaped it , into the foaming tide , and swam , and landed according to orders . Also his flight from a public - house where a trap was set for him , but Winnie came and broke down the door , and put two men under , and trod on them , is as well known as any ballad . It was reported for awhile that poor Tom had been caught at last , by means of his fondness for liquor , and was hanged before Taunton Jail ; but luckily we knew better . With a good wife , and a wonderful horse , and all the country attached to him , he kept the law at a wholesome distance , until it became too much for its master ; and a new king arose . Upon this , Tom sued his pardon afresh ; and Jeremy Stickles , who suited the times , was glad to help him in getting it , as well as a compensation . Thereafter the good and respectable Tom lived a godly though not always sober life ; and brought up his children to honesty , as the first of all qualifications . My dear mother was as happy as possibly need be with us ; having no cause for jealousy , as others arose around her . And everybody was well pleased , when Lizzy came in one day and tossed her bookshelf over , and declared that she would have Captain Bloxham , and nobody should prevent her . For that he alone , of all the men she had ever met with , knew good writing when he saw it , and could spell a word when told . As he had now succeeded to Captain Stickle 's position Stickles going up the tree , and had the power of collecting , and of keeping , what he liked , there was nothing to be said against it ; and we hoped that he would pay her out . I sent little Ensie to Blundell 's school , at my own cost and charges , having changed his name , for fear of what anyone might do to him . I called him Ensie Jones ; and we got him a commission , and after many scrapes of spirit , he did great things in the Low Countries . He looks upon me as his father ; and without my leave will not lay claim to the heritage and title of the Doones , which clearly belong to him . Ruth Huckaback is not married yet ; although upon Uncle Reuben 's death she came into all his property ; except , indeed , 2000 pounds , which Uncle Ben , in his driest manner , bequeathed '
323619	323911	323603	323605	Sir John Ridd	622	' And he left almost a mint of money , not from the mine , but from the shop , and the good use of usury . For the mine had brought in just what it cost , when the vein of gold ended suddenly ; leaving all concerned much older , and some , I fear , much poorer ; but no one utterly ruined , as is the case with most of them . Ruth herself was his true mine , as upon death - bed he found . I know a man even worthy of her : and though she is not very young , he loves her , as I love Lorna . It is my firm conviction , that in the end he will win her ; and I do not mean to dance again , except at dear Ruth 's wedding ; if the floor be strong enough . Of Lorna , of my lifelong darling , of my more and more loved wife , I will not talk ; for it is not seemly that a man should exalt his pride . Year by year her beauty grows , with the growth of goodness , kindness , and true happiness above all with loving . For change , she makes a joke of this , and plays with it , and laughs at it ; and then , when my slow nature marvels , back she comes to the earnest thing . And if I wish to pay her out for something very dreadful as may happen once or twice , when we become too gladsome I bring her to forgotten sadness , and to me for cure of it , by the two words '
