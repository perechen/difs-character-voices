1226	1235	1220	1220	he	2155	" Is it a letter from another Jook , "
1242	1257	1237	1238	Mr. Glowry	667	" Pendennis would not be leaving that to the last , I 'm thinking . "
1258	1264	1182	1183	the Major	2155	" My dear Major Pendennis , "
1269	1280	1286	1286	Pendennis	661	" I beg and implore you to come to me immediately "
1296	1343	1345	1346	the Major	2155	" I am in the very greatest grief and perplexity . My dearest boy , who has been hitherto everything the fondest mother could wish , is grieving me dreadfully . He has formed - I can hardly write it - a passion , an infatuation , "
1349	1387	1345	1346	the Major	2155	" for an actress who has been performing here . She is at least twelve years older than Arthur - who will not be eighteen till next February - and the wretched boy insists upon marrying her . "
1388	1398	1400	1401	Mr. Glowry	667	" Hay ! What 's making Pendennis swear now ? "
1426	1433	1434	1438	the grief - stricken lady	2208	" Do , my dear friend , "
1442	1475	1434	1438	the grief - stricken lady	2208	" come to me instantly on the receipt of this ; and , as Arthur 's guardian , entreat , command , the wretched child to give up this most deplorable resolution . "
1504	1508	1510	1511	the Major	2155	" Fairoaks , Tuesday "
1522	1545	1547	1547	he	2155	" A d - -d pretty business at Fairoaks , Tuesday ; now let us see what the boy has to say ; "
1607	1614	1615	1615	My	0	" Fairoaks , Monday , Midnight . "
1839	1952	1826	1827	Mr. Costigan	680	" It is in vain I have attempted to argue with my dear mother , and prove to her that a young lady of irreproachable character and lineage , endowed with the most splendid gifts of beauty and genius , who devotes herself to the exercise of one of the noblest professions , for the sacred purpose of maintaining her family , is a being whom we should all love and reverence , rather than avoid ; - my poor mother has prejudices which it is impossible for my logic to overcome , and refuses to welcome to her arms one who is disposed to be her most affectionate daughter through life . "
2121	2252	2273	2273	you	2233	" I press for a speedy marriage with my Emily - for why , in truth , should it be delayed ? A delay implies a doubt , which I cast from me as unworthy . It is impossible that my sentiments can change towards Emily - that at any age she can be anything but the sole object of my love . Why , then , wait ? I entreat you , my dear Uncle , to come down and reconcile my dear mother to our union , and I address you as a man of the world , qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes , who will not feel any of the weak scruples and fears which agitate a lady who has scarcely ever left her village . "
2291	2384	2385	2386	The mother	2237	" When the Major had concluded the perusal of this letter , his countenance assumed an expression of such rage and horror that Glowry , the surgeon - official , felt in his pocket for his lancet , which he always carried in his card - case , and thought his respected friend was going into a fit . The intelligence was indeed sufficient to agitate Pendennis . The head of the Pendennises going to marry an actress ten years his senior , - a headstrong boy going to plunge into matrimony . "
2393	2399	2401	2401	her	2237	" groaned the Major inwardly , "
2433	3374	2418	2418	people	2241	" And he thought with an inexpressible pang that he must give up Lord Steyne 's dinner at Richmond , and must lose his rest and pass the night in an abominable tight mail - coach , instead of taking pleasure , as he had promised himself , in some of the most agreeable and select society in England . And he must not only give up this but all other engagements for some time to come . Who knows how long the business might detain him . He quitted his breakfast table for the adjoining writing - room , and there ruefully wrote off refusals to the Marquis , the Earl , the Bishop , and all his entertainers ; and he ordered his servant to take places in the mail - coach for that evening , of course charging the sum which he disbursed for the seats to the account of the widow and the young scapegrace of whom he was guardian . CHAPTER II A Pedigree and other Family Matters Early in the Regency of George the Magnificent , there lived in a small town in the west of England , called Clavering , a gentleman whose name was Pendennis . There were those alive who remembered having seen his name painted on a board , which was surmounted by a gilt pestle and mortar over the door of a very humble little shop in the city of Bath , where Mr. Pendennis exercised the profession of apothecary and surgeon ; and where he not only attended gentlemen in their sick - rooms , and ladies at the most interesting periods of their lives , but would condescend to sell a brown - paper plaster to a farmer 's wife across the counter , - or to vend tooth - brushes , hair - powder , and London perfumery . For these facts a few folks at Clavering could vouch , where people 's memories were more tenacious , perhaps , than they are in a great bustling metropolis . And yet that little apothecary who sold a stray customer a pennyworth of salts , or a more fragrant cake of Windsor soap , was a gentleman of good education , and of as old a family as any in the whole county of Somerset . He had a Cornish pedigree which carried the Pendennises up to the time of the Druids , and who knows how much farther back ? They had intermarried with the Normans at a very late period of their family existence , and they were related to all the great families of Wales and Brittany . Pendennis had had a piece of University education too , and might have pursued that career with great honour , but that in his second year at Cambridge his father died insolvent , and poor Pen was obliged to betake himself to the pestle and apron . He always detested the trade , and it was only necessity , and the offer of his mother 's brother , a London apothecary of low family , into which Pendennis 's father had demeaned himself by marrying , that forced John Pendennis into so odious a calling . He quickly after his apprenticeship parted from the coarse - minded practitioner his relative , and set up for himself at Bath with his modest medical ensign . He had for some time a hard struggle with poverty ; and it was all he could do to keep the shop and its gilt ornaments in decent repair , and his bed - ridden mother in comfort : but Lady Ribstone happening to be passing to the Rooms with an intoxicated Irish chairman who bumped her ladyship up against Pen 's very door - post , and drove his chair - pole through the handsomest pink bottle in the surgeon 's window , alighted screaming from her vehicle , and was accommodated with a chair in Mr. Pendennis 's shop , where she was brought round with cinnamon and sal - volatile . Mr. Pendennis 's manners were so uncommonly gentlemanlike and soothing , that her ladyship , the wife of Sir Pepin Ribstone , of Codlingbury , in the county of Somerset , Bart . , appointed her preserver , as she called him , apothecary to her person and family , which was very large . Master Ribstone coming home for the Christmas holidays from Eton , over - ate himself and had a fever , in which Mr. Pendennis treated him with the greatest skill and tenderness . In a word , he got the good graces of the Codlingbury family , and from that day began to prosper . The good company of Bath patronised him , and amongst the ladies especially he was beloved and admired . First his humble little shop became a smart one : then he discarded the selling of tooth - brushes and perfumery , as unworthy of a gentleman of an ancient lineage : then he shut up the shop altogether , and only had a little surgery attended by a genteel young man : then he had a gig with a man to drive him ; and , before her exit from this world , his poor old mother had the happiness of seeing from her bedroom window to which her chair was rolled , her beloved John step into a close carriage of his own , a one - horse carriage it is true , but with the arms of the family of Pendennis handsomely emblazoned on the panels . "
3381	3393	3377	3377	Arthur	661	" she asked , speaking of a younger son of hers - "
3416	3417	3377	3377	Arthur	661	" "
3429	3434	3427	3427	mother	2244	" Mr. Pendennis remarked , "
3458	6046	3455	3456	Mr. Parkins	694	" Presently the day came when she ceased to call her son by the name of Johnny , or by any other title of endearment or affection ; and his house was very lonely without that kind though querulous voice . He had his night - bell altered and placed in the room in which the good old lady had grumbled for many a long year , and he slept in the great large bed there . He was upwards of forty years old when these events befell ; before the war was over ; before George the Magnificent came to the throne ; before this history indeed : but what is a gentleman without his pedigree ? Pendennis , by this time , had his handsomely framed and glazed , and hanging up in his drawing - room between the pictures of Codlingbury House in Somersetshire , and St. Boniface 's College , Cambridge , where he had passed the brief and happy days of his early manhood . As for the pedigree he had taken it out of a trunk , as Sterne 's officer called for his sword , now that he was a gentleman and could show it . About the time of Mrs. Pendennis 's demise , another of her son 's patients likewise died at Bath ; that virtuous woman , old Lady Pontypool , daughter of Reginald twelfth Earl of Bareacres , and by consequence great - grand - aunt to the present Earl , and widow of John second Lord Pontypool , and likewise of the Reverend Jonas Wales , of the Armageddon Chapel , Clifton . For the last five years of her life her ladyship had been attended by Miss Helen Thistlewood , a very distant relative of the noble house of Bareacres , before mentioned , and daughter of Lieutenant R. Thistlewood , R.N. , killed at the battle of Copenhagen . Under Lady Pontypool 's roof Miss Thistlewood found a comfortable shelter , as far as boarding and lodging went , but suffered under such an infernal tyranny as only women can inflict on , or bear from , one another : the Doctor , who paid his visits to my Lady Pontypool at least twice a day , could not but remark the angelical sweetness and kindness with which the young lady bore her elderly relative 's insults ; and it was , as they were going in the fourth mourning coach to attend her ladyship 's venerated remains to Bath Abbey , where they now repose , that he looked at her sweet pale face and resolved upon putting a certain question to her , the very nature of which made his pulse beat ninety , at least . He was older than she by more than twenty years , and at no time the most ardent of men . Perhaps he had had a love affair in early life which he had to strangle - perhaps all early love affairs ought to be strangled or drowned , like so many blind kittens : well , at three - and - forty he was a collected quiet little gentleman in black stockings with a bald head , and a few days after the ceremony he called to see her , and , as he felt her pulse , he kept hold of her hand in his , and asked her where she was going to live now that the Pontypool family had come down upon the property , which was being nailed into boxes , and packed into hampers , and swaddled up with haybands , and buried in straw , and locked under three keys in green baize plate - chests , and carted away under the eyes of poor Miss Helen , - he asked her where she was going to live finally . Her eyes filled with tears , and she said she did not know . She had a little money . The old lady had left her a thousand pounds , indeed ; and she would go into a boarding - house or into a school : in fine , she did not know where . Then Pendennis , looking into her pale face , and keeping hold of her cold little hand , asked her if she would come and live with him ? He was old compared to - to so blooming a young lady as Miss Thistlewood Pendennis was of the grave old complimentary school of gentlemen and apothecaries , but he was of good birth , and , he flattered himself , of good principles and temper . His prospects were good , and daily mending . He was alone in the world , and had need of a kind and constant companion , whom it would be the study of his life to make happy ; in a word , he recited to her a little speech , which he had composed that morning in bed , and rehearsed and perfected in his carriage , as he was coming to wait upon the young lady . Perhaps if he had had an early love - passage , she too had one day hoped for a different lot than to be wedded to a little gentleman who rapped his teeth and smiled artificially , who was laboriously polite to the butler as he slid upstairs into the drawing - room , and profusely civil to the lady's - maid , who waited at the bed - room door ; for whom her old patroness used to ring as for a servant , and who came with even more eagerness ; who got up stories , as he sent in draughts , for his patient 's amusement and his own profit : perhaps she would have chosen a different man - but she knew , on the other hand , how worthy Pendennis was , how prudent , how honourable ; how good he had been to his mother , and constant in his care of her ; and the upshot of this interview was , that she , blushing very much , made Pendennis an extremely low curtsey , and asked leave to - to consider his very kind proposal . They were married in the dull Bath season , which was the height of the season in London . And Pendennis having previously , through a professional friend , M.R.C.S. , secured lodgings in Holles Street , Cavendish Square , took his wife thither in a chaise and pair ; conducted her to the theatres , the Parks , and the Chapel Royal ; showed her the folks going to a drawing - room , and , in a word , gave her all the pleasures of the town . He likewise left cards upon Lord Pontypool , upon the Right Honourable the Earl of Bareacres , and upon Sir Pepin and Lady Ribstone , his earliest and kindest patrons . Bareacres took no notice of the cards . Pontypool called , admired Mrs. Pendennis , and said Lady Pontypool would come and see her , which her ladyship did , per proxy of John her footman , who brought her card , and an invitation to a concert five weeks off . Pendennis was back in his little one - horse carriage , dispensing draughts and pills at that time : but the Ribstones asked him and Mrs. Pendennis to an entertainment , of which Mr. Pendennis bragged to the last day of his life . The secret ambition of Mr. Pendennis had always been to be a gentleman . It takes much time and careful saving for a provincial doctor , whose gains are not very large , to lay by enough money wherewith to purchase a house and land : but besides our friend 's own frugality and prudence , fortune aided him considerably in his endeavour , and brought him to the point which he so panted to attain . He laid out some money very advantageously in the purchase of a house and small estate close upon the village of Clavering before mentioned . Words can not describe , nor did he himself ever care to confess to any one , his pride when he found himself a real landed proprietor , and could walk over acres of which he was the master . A lucky purchase which he had made of shares in a copper - mine added very considerably to his wealth , and he realised with great prudence while this mine was still at its full vogue . Finally , he sold his business at Bath , to Mr. Parkins , for a handsome sum of ready money , and for an annuity to be paid to him during a certain number of years after he had for ever retired from the handling of the mortar and pestle . Arthur Pendennis , his son , was eight years old at the time of this event , so that it is no wonder that the latter , who left Bath and the surgery so young , should forget the existence of such a place almost entirely , and that his father 's hands had ever been dirtied by the compounding of odious pills , or the preparation of filthy plasters . The old man never spoke about the shop himself , never alluded to it ; called in the medical practitioner of Clavering to attend his family when occasion arrived ; sunk the black breeches and stockings altogether ; attended market and sessions , and wore a bottle - green coat and brass buttons with drab gaiters , just as if he had been an English gentleman all his life . He used to stand at his lodge - gate , and see the coaches come in , and bow gravely to the guards and coachmen as they touched their hats and drove by . It was he who founded the Clavering Book Club : and set up the Samaritan Soup and Blanket Society . It was he who brought the mail , which used to run through Cacklefield before , away from that village and through Clavering . At church he was equally active as a vestryman and a worshipper . At market every Thursday , he went from pen to stall , looked at samples of oats , and munched corn , felt beasts , punched geese in the breast , and weighed them with a knowing air , and did business with the farmers at the Clavering Arms , as well as the oldest frequenter of that house of call . It was now his shame , as it formerly was his pride , to be called Doctor , and those who wished to please him always gave him the title of Squire . Heaven knows where they came from , but a whole range of Pendennis portraits presently hung round the Doctor 's oak dining - room ; Lelys and Vandykes he vowed all the portraits to be , and when questioned as to the history of the originals , would vaguely say they were ' ancestors of his . ' You could see by his wife 's looks that she disbelieved in these genealogical legends , for she generally endeavoured to turn the conversation when he commenced them . But his little boy believed them to their fullest extent , and Roger Pendennis of Agincourt , Arthur Pendennis of Crecy , General Pendennis of Blenheim and Oudenarde , were as real and actual beings for this young gentleman as - whom shall we say ? - as Robinson Crusoe , or Peter Wilkins , or the Seven Champions of Christendom , whose histories were in his library . Pendennis 's fortune , which , at the best , was not above eight hundred pounds a year , did not , with the best economy and management , permit of his living with the great folks of the county ; but he had a decent comfortable society of the second - best sort . If they were not the roses , they lived near the roses , as it were , and had a good deal of the odour of genteel life . They had out their plate , and dined each other round in the moonlight nights twice a year , coming a dozen miles to these festivals ; and besides the county , the Pendennises had the society of the town of Clavering , as much as , nay , more than they liked : for Mrs. Pybus was always poking about Helen 's conservatories , and intercepting the operation of her soup - tickets and coal - clubs Captain Glanders H. P. , 50th Dragoon Guards was for ever swaggering about the Squire 's stables and gardens , and endeavouring to enlist him in his quarrels with the Vicar , with the Postmaster , with the Reverend F. Wapshot of Clavering Grammar School , for overflogging his son , Anglesea Glanders , - with all the village in fine . And Pendennis and his wife often blessed themselves , that their house of Fairoaks was nearly a mile out of Clavering , or their premises would never have been free from the prying eyes and prattle of one or other of the male and female inhabitants there . Fairoaks lawn comes down to the little river Brawl , and on the other side were the plantations and woods as much as were left of them of Clavering Park , Sir Francis Clavering , Bart . The park was let out in pasture and fed down by sheep and cattle , when the Pendennises came first to live at Fairoaks . Shutters were up in the house ; a splendid freestone palace , with great stairs , statues , and porticos , whereof you may see a picture in the ' Beauties of England and Wales . ' Sir Richard Clavering , Sir Francis's - grandfather , had commenced the ruin of the family by the building of this palace : his successor had achieved the ruin by living in it . The present Sir Francis was abroad somewhere ; nor could anybody be found rich enough to rent that enormous mansion , through the deserted rooms , mouldy clanking halls , and dismal galleries of which , Arthur Pendennis many a time walked trembling when he was a boy . At sunset , from the lawn of Fairoaks , there was a pretty sight : it and the opposite park of Clavering were in the habit of putting on a rich golden tinge , which became them both wonderfully . The upper windows of the great house flamed so as to make your eyes wink ; the little river ran off noisily westward , and was lost in a sombre wood , behind which the towers of the old abbey church of Clavering whereby that town is called Clavering St. Mary 's to the present day rose up in purple splendour . Little Arthur 's figure and his mother 's , cast long blue shadows over the grass ; and he would repeat in a low voice for a scene of great natural beauty always moved the boy , who inherited this sensibility from his mother certain lines beginning , "
6064	6532	6533	6534	My brother	2248	" greatly to Mrs. Pendennis 's delight . Such walks and conversation generally ended in a profusion of filial and maternal embraces ; for to love and to pray were the main occupations of this dear woman 's life ; and I have often heard Pendennis say in his wild way , that he felt that he was sure of going to heaven , for his mother never could be happy there without him . As for John Pendennis , as the father of the family , and that sort of thing , everybody had the greatest respect for him : and his orders were obeyed like those of the Medes and Persians . His hat was as well brushed , perhaps , as that of any man in this empire . His meals were served at the same minute every day , and woe to those who came late , as little Pen , a disorderly little rascal , sometimes did . Prayers were recited , his letters were read , his business dispatched , his stables and garden inspected , his hen - houses and kennel , his barn and pigstye visited , always at regular hours . After dinner he always had a nap with the Globe newspaper on his knee , and his yellow bandanna handkerchief on his face Major Pendennis sent the yellow handkerchiefs from India , and his brother had helped in the purchase of his majority , so that they were good friends now . And so , as his dinner took place at six o'clock to a minute , and the sunset business alluded to may be supposed to have occurred at about half - past seven , it is probable that he did not much care for the view in front of his lawn windows or take any share in the poetry and caresses which were taking place there . They seldom occurred in his presence . However frisky they were before , mother and child were hushed and quiet when Mr. Pendennis walked into the drawing - room , his newspaper under his arm . And here , while little Pen , buried in a great chair , read all the books of which he could lay hold , the Squire perused his own articles in the ' Gardener 's Gazette , ' or took a solemn hand at picquet with Mrs. Pendennis , or an occasional friend from the village . Pendennis usually took care that at least one of his grand dinners should take place when his brother , the Major , who , on the return of his regiment from India and New South Wales , had sold out and gone upon half - pay , came to pay his biennial visit to Fairoaks . "
6539	6618	6533	6534	My brother	2248	" was a constant theme of the retired Doctor 's conversation . All the family delighted in my brother the Major . He was the link which bound them to the great world of London , and the fashion . He always brought down the last news of the nobility , and was in the constant habit of dining with lords and great folks . He spoke of such with soldierlike respect and decorum . He would say , "
6636	6639	6640	6640	My	0	" or , "
6659	6786	6642	6642	Steyne	669	" and you may be sure the whereabouts of my brother the Major was carefully made known by worthy Mr. Pendennis to his friends at the Clavering Reading room , at Justice - meetings , or at the County - town . Their carriages would come from ten miles round to call upon Major Pendennis in his visits to Fairoaks ; the fame of his fashion as a man about town was established throughout the county . There was a talk of his marrying Miss Hunkle , of Lilybank , old Hunkle the Attorney 's daughter , with at least fifteen hundred a - year to her fortune : but my brother the Major refused this negotiation , advantageous as it might seem to most persons . "
6791	6795	6642	6642	Steyne	669	" he said , "
6933	7377	7382	7383	my lord	2259	" Time showed the correctness of the surmise of the old man of the world ; Miss Hunkle married a young French nobleman , and is now at this moment living at Lilybank , under the title of Baroness de Carambole , having been separated from her wild young scapegrace of a Baron very shortly after their union . The Major was a great favourite with almost all the little establishment of Fairoaks . He was as good - natured as he was well bred , and had a sincere liking and regard for his sister - in - law , whom he pronounced , and with perfect truth , to be as fine a lady as any in England , and an honour to the family . Indeed , Mrs. Pendennis 's tranquil beauty , her natural sweetness and kindness , and that simplicity and dignity which a perfect purity and innocence are sure to bestow upon a handsome woman , rendered her quite worthy of her brother 's praises . I think it is not national prejudice which makes me believe that a high - bred English lady is the most complete of all Heaven 's subjects in this world . In whom else do you see so much grace , and so much virtue ; so much faith , and so much tenderness ; with such a perfect refinement and chastity ? And by high - bred ladies I do n't mean duchesses and countesses . Be they ever so high in station , they can be but ladies , and no more . But almost every man who lives in the world has the happiness , let us hope , of counting a few such persons amongst his circle of acquaintance - women , in whose angelical natures , there is something awful , as well as beautiful , to contemplate ; at whose feet the wildest and fiercest of us must fall down and humble ourselves ; - in admiration of that adorable purity which never seems to do or to think wrong . Arthur Pendennis had the good fortune to have a mother endowed with these happy qualities . During his childhood and youth , the boy thought of her as little less than an angel , - as a supernatural being , all wisdom , love , and beauty . When her husband drove her into the county town , or to the assize balls or concerts there , he would step into the assembly with his wife on his arm , and look the great folks in the face , as much as to say , "
7396	8970	7388	7388	you	2259	" She enraged some country ladies with three times her money , by a sort of desperate perfection which they found in her . Miss Pybus said she was cold and haughty ; Miss Pierce , that she was too proud for her station ; Mrs. Wapshot , as a doctor of divinity 's lady , would have the pas of her , who was only the wife of a medical practitioner . In the meanwhile , this lady moved through the world quite regardless of all the comments that were made in her praise or disfavour . She did not seem to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect : but carried on calmly through life , saying her prayers , loving her family , helping her neighbours , and doing her duty . That even a woman should be faultless , however , is an arrangement not permitted by nature , which assigns to us mental defects , as it awards to us headaches , illnesses , or death ; without which the scheme of the world could not be carried on , - nay , some of the best qualities of mankind could not be brought into exercise . As pain produces or elicits fortitude and endurance ; difficulty , perseverance ; poverty , industry and ingenuity ; danger , courage and what not ; so the very virtues , on the other hand , will generate some vices : and , in fine , Mrs. Pendennis had that vice which Miss Pybus and Miss Pierce discovered in her , namely , that of pride ; which did not vest itself so much in her own person , as in that of her family . She spoke about Mr. Pendennis a worthy little gentleman enough , but there are others as good as he with an awful reverence , as if he had been the Pope of Rome on his throne , and she a cardinal kneeling at his feet , and giving him incense . The Major she held to be a sort of Bayard among Majors : and as for her son Arthur she worshipped that youth with an ardour which the young scapegrace accepted almost as coolly as the statue of the Saint in Saint Peter 's receives the rapturous osculations which the faithful deliver on his toe . This unfortunate superstition and idol - worship of this good woman was the cause of a great deal of the misfortune which befell the young gentleman who is the hero of this history , and deserves therefore to be mentioned at the outset of his story . Arthur Pendennis 's schoolfellows at the Greyfriars School state that , as a boy , he was in no ways remarkable either as a dunce or as a scholar . He did , in fact , just as much as was required of him , and no more . If he was distinguished for anything it was for verse - writing : but was his enthusiasm ever so great , it stopped when he had composed the number of lines demanded by the regulations unlike young Swettenham , for instance , who , with no more of poetry in his composition than Mr. Wakley , yet would bring up a hundred dreary hexameters to the master after a half - holiday ; or young Fluxmore , who not only did his own verses , but all the fifth form 's besides . He never read to improve himself out of school - hours , but , on the contrary , devoured all the novels , plays , and poetry , on which he could lay his hands . He never was flogged , but it was a wonder how he escaped the whipping - post . When he had money he spent it royally in tarts for himself and his friends ; he has been known to disburse nine and sixpence out of ten shillings awarded to him in a single day . When he had no funds he went on tick . When he could get no credit he went without , and was almost as happy . He has been known to take a thrashing for a crony without saying a word ; but a blow , ever so slight from a friend , would make him roar . To fighting he was averse from his earliest youth , as indeed to physic , the Greek Grammar , or any other exertion , and would engage in none of them , except at the last extremity . He seldom if ever told lies , and never bullied little boys . Those masters or seniors who were kind to him , he loved with boyish ardour . And though the Doctor , when he did not know his Horace , or could not construe his Greek play , said that that boy Pendennis was a disgrace to the school , a candidate for ruin in this world , and perdition in the next ; a profligate who would most likely bring his venerable father to ruin and his mother to a dishonoured grave , and the like - yet as the Doctor made use of these compliments to most of the boys in the place which has not turned out an unusual number of felons and pickpockets , little Pen , at first uneasy and terrified by these charges , became gradually accustomed to hear them ; and he has not , in fact , either murdered his parents , or committed any act worthy of transportation or hanging up to the present day . tutu There were many of the upper boys , among the Cistercians with whom Pendennis was educated , who assumed all the privileges of men long before they quitted that seminary . Many of them , for example , smoked cigars - and some had already begun the practice of inebriation . One had fought a duel with an Ensign in a marching , in consequence of a row at the theatre - another actually kept a buggy and horse at a livery stable in Covent Garden , and might be seen driving any Sunday in Hyde Park with a groom with squared arms and armorial buttons by his side . Many of the seniors were in love , and showed each other in confidence poems addressed to , or letters and locks of hair received from , young ladies - but Pen , a modest and timid youth , rather envied these than imitated them as yet . He had not got beyond the theory as yet - the practice of life was all to come . And by the way , ye tender mothers and sober fathers of Christian families , a prodigious thing that theory of life is as orally learned at a great public school . Why , if you could hear those boys of fourteen who blush before mothers and sneak off in silence in the presence of their daughters , talking among each other - it would be the women 's turn to blush then . Before he was twelve years old and if while his mother fancied him an angel of candour , little Pen had heard talk enough to make him quite awfully wise upon certain points - and so , Madam , has your pretty little rosy - cheeked son , who is coming home from school for the ensuing Christmas holidays . I do n't say that the boy is lost , or that the innocence has left him which he had from ' Heaven , which is our home , ' but that the shades of the prison - house are closing very fast over him , and that we are helping as much as possible to corrupt him . Well - Pen had just made his public appearance in a coat with a tail , or cauda virilis , and was looking most anxiously in his little study - glass to see if his whiskers were growing , like those of more fortunate youths his companions ; and , instead of the treble voice with which he used to speak and sing for his singing voice was a very sweet one , and he used when little to be made to perform ' Home , sweet Home , ' ' My pretty Page , ' and a French song or two which his mother had taught him , and other ballads for the delectation of the senior boys , had suddenly plunged into a deep bass diversified by a squeak , which when he was called upon to construe in school set the master and scholars laughing he was about sixteen years old , in a word , when he was suddenly called away from his academic studies . It was at the close of the forenoon school , and Pen had been unnoticed all the previous part of the morning till now , when the Doctor put him on to construe in a Greek play . He did not know a word of it , though little Timmins , his form - fellow , was prompting him with all his might . Pen had made a sad blunder or two when the awful Chief broke out upon him . "
8975	8979	7388	7388	you	2259	" he said , "
9281	9500	9501	9501	I	0	" shouted the Doctor . Indeed , while the master was making this oration , there was a general titter behind him in the schoolroom . The orator had his back to the door of this ancient apartment , which was open , and a gentleman who was quite familiar with the place , for both Major Arthur and Mr. John Pendennis had been at the school , was asking the fifth - form boy who sate by the door for Pendennis . The lad grinning pointed to the culprit against whom the Doctor was pouring out the thunders of his just wrath - Major Pendennis could not help laughing . He remembered having stood under that very pillar where Pen the younger now stood , and having been assaulted by the Doctor 's predecessor years and years ago . The intelligence was ' passed round ' that it was Pendennis 's uncle in an instant , and a hundred young faces wondering and giggling , between terror and laughter , turned now to the new - comer and then to the awful Doctor . The Major asked the fifth - form boy to carry his card up to the Doctor , which the lad did with an arch look . Major Pendennis had written on the card , "
9514	9550	9508	9509	his father	13926	" As the Doctor received the card , and stopped his harangue with rather a seared look , the laughter of the boys , half constrained until then , burst out in a general shout . "
9553	9610	9508	9509	his father	13926	" roared out the Doctor stamping with his foot . Pen looked up and saw who was his deliverer ; the Major beckoned to him gravely with one of his white gloves , and tumbling down his books , Pen went across . The Doctor took out his watch . It was two minutes to one . "
9620	9662	9611	9611	We	2285	" he said , nodding to the Captain , and all the boys understanding the signal gathered up their books and poured out of the hall . Young Pen saw by his uncle 's face that something had happened at home . "
9672	9695	9669	9670	my mother	2288	" he said . He could hardly speak , though , for emotion , and the tears which were ready to start . "
9698	9703	9669	9670	my mother	2288	" said the Major , "
9727	9822	9718	9718	I	0	" Pen went off quickly to his boarding - house to do as his uncle bade him ; and the Doctor , now left alone in the schoolroom , came out to shake hands with his old schoolfellow . You would not have thought it was the same man . As Cinderella at a particular hour became , from a blazing and magnificent Princess , quite an ordinary little maid in a grey petticoat , so , as the clock struck one , all the thundering majesty and awful wrath of the schoolmaster disappeared . "
9831	9836	9828	9828	I	0	" said the Doctor . "
9904	9941	9894	9895	My wife	2294	" But Major Pendennis declined the luncheon . He said his brother was very ill , had had a fit the day before , and it was a great question if they should see him alive . "
9951	9959	9894	9895	My wife	2294	" said the Doctor . The Major answered "
9962	9963	9894	9895	My wife	2294	" "
9979	9990	9976	9976	I	0	" asked the other in an off - hand way . "
9996	11093	11094	11094	You	2297	" said the Major . Whereupon this colloquy came to an end . And Arthur Pendennis got into the postchaise with his uncle never to come back to school any more . As the chaise drove through Clavering , the hostler standing whistling under the archway of the Clavering Arms , winked the postilion ominously , as much as to say all was over . The gardener 's wife came and opened the lodge - gates , and let the travellers through with a silent shake of the head . All the blinds were down at Fairoaks - the face of the old footman was as blank when he let them in . Arthur 's face was white too , with terror more than with grief . Whatever of warmth and love the deceased man might have had , and he adored his wife and loved and admired his son with all his heart , he had shut them up within himself ; nor had the boy been ever able to penetrate that frigid outward barrier . But Arthur had been his father 's pride and glory through life , and his name the last which John Pendennis had tried to articulate whilst he lay with his wife 's hand clasping his own cold and clammy palm , as the flickering spirit went out into the darkness of death , and life and the world passed away from him . The little girl , whose face had peered for a moment under the blinds as the chaise came up , opened the door from the stairs into the hall , and taking Arthur 's hand silently as he stooped down to kiss her , led him upstairs to his mother . Old John opened the dining - room door for the Major . The room was darkened with the blinds down , and surrounded by all the gloomy pictures of the Pendennises . He drank a glass of wine . The bottle had been opened for the Squire four days before . His hat was brushed , and laid on the hall table : his newspapers , and his letter - bag , with John Pendennis , Esquire , Fairoaks , engraved upon the brass plate , were there in waiting . The doctor and the lawyer from Clavering , who had seen the chaise pass through , came up in a gig half an hour after the Major 's arrival , and entered by the back door . The former gave a detailed account of the seizure and demise of Mr. Pendennis , enlarged on his virtues and the estimation in which the neighbourhood held him ; on what a loss he would be to the magistrates ' bench , the County Hospital , etc . Mrs. Pendennis bore up wonderfully , he said , especially since Master Arthur 's arrival . The lawyer stayed and dined with Major Pendennis , and they talked business all the evening . The Major was his brother 's executor , and joint guardian to the boy with Mrs. Pendennis . Everything was left unreservedly to her , except in case of a second marriage , - an occasion which might offer itself in the case of so young and handsome a woman , Mr. Tatham gallantly said , when different provisions were enacted by the deceased . The Major would of course take entire superintendence of everything under this most impressive and melancholy occasion . Aware of this authority , old John the footman , when he brought Major Pendennis the candle to go to bed , followed afterwards with the plate - basket ; and the next morning brought him the key of the hall clock - the Squire always used to wind it up of a Thursday , John said . Mrs. Pendennis 's maid brought him messages from her mistress . She confirmed the doctor 's report , of the comfort which Master Arthur 's arrival had caused to his mother . What passed between that lady and the boy is not of import . A veil should be thrown over those sacred emotions of love and grief . The maternal passion is a sacred mystery to me . What one sees symbolised in the Roman churches in the image of the Virgin Mother with a bosom bleeding with love , I think one may witness and admire the Almighty bounty for every day . I saw a Jewish lady , only yesterday , with a child at her knee , and from whose face towards the child there shone a sweetness so angelical , that it seemed to form a sort of glory round both . I protest I could have knelt before her too , and adored in her the Divine beneficence in endowing us with the maternal storge , which began with our race and sanctifies the history of mankind . So it was with this , in a word , that Mrs. Pendennis comforted herself on the death of her husband , whom , however , she always reverenced as the best , the most upright , wise , high - minded , accomplished , and awful of men . If the women did not make idols of us , and if they saw us as we see each other , would life be bearable , or could society go on ? Let a man pray that none of his womankind should form a just estimation of him . If your wife knew you as you are , neighbour , she would not grieve much about being your widow , and would let your grave - lamp go out very soon , or perhaps not even take the trouble to light it . Whereas Helen Pendennis put up the handsomest of memorials to her husband , and constantly renewed it with the most precious oil . As for Arthur Pendennis , after that awful shock which the sight of his dead father must have produced on him , and the pity and feeling which such an event no doubt occasioned , I am not sure that in the very moment of the grief , and as he embraced his mother and tenderly consoled her , and promised to love her for ever , there was not springing up in his breast a feeling of secret triumph and exultation . He was the chief now and lord . He was Pendennis ; and all round about him were his servants and handmaids . "
11101	11115	11094	11094	You	2297	" little Laura said , tripping by him , and holding his hand . "
11129	11374	11125	11125	you	2297	" Arthur kissed her and patted her head . No , she should n't go to school . As for going himself , that was quite out of the question . He had determined that that part of his life should not be renewed . In the midst of the general grief , and the corpse still lying above , he had leisure to conclude that he would have it all holidays for the future , that he would n't get up till he liked , or stand the bullying of the Doctor any more , and had made a hundred of such day - dreams and resolves for the future . How one 's thoughts will travel ! and how quickly our wishes beget them ! When he with Laura in his hand went into the kitchen on his way to the dog - kennel , the fowl - houses , and other his favourite haunts , all the servants there assembled in great silence with their friends , and the labouring men and their wives , and Sally Potter who went with the post - bag to Clavering , and the baker 's man from Clavering - all there assembled and drinking beer on the melancholy occasion - rose up on his entrance and bowed or curtseyed to him . They never used to do so last holidays , he felt at once and with indescribable pleasure . The cook cried out , "
11378	11382	11125	11125	you	2297	" and whispered , "
11389	11457	11458	11459	Poo Ponto	745	" Thomas , the groom , in the act of drinking , put down the jug alarmed before his master . Thomas 's master felt the honour keenly . He went through and looked at the pointers . As Flora put her nose up to his waistcoat , and Ponto , yelling with pleasure , hurtled at his chain , Pen patronised the dogs , and said , "
11464	11537	11458	11459	Poo Ponto	745	" in his most condescending manner . And then he went and looked at Laura 's hens , and at the pigs , and at the orchard , and at the dairy ; perhaps he blushed to think that it was only last holidays he had in a manner robbed the great apple - tree , and been scolded by the dairymaid for taking cream . They buried John Pendennis , Esquire , "
11571	11676	11458	11459	Poo Ponto	745	" with one of the most handsome funerals that had been seen since Sir Roger Clavering was buried here , the clerk said , in the abbey church of Clavering St. Mary 's . A fair marble slab , from which the above inscription is copied , was erected over the Fairoaks ' pew in the church . On it you may see the Pendennis coat of arms , and crest , an eagle looking towards the sun , with the motto ' nec tenui penna , ' to the present day . Doctor Portman alluded to the deceased most handsomely and affectingly , as "
11682	12334	11458	11459	Poo Ponto	745	" in his sermon next Sunday ; and Arthur Pendennis reigned in his stead . CHAPTER III In which Pendennis appears as a very young Man indeed Arthur was about sixteen years old , we have said , when he began to reign ; in person for I see that the artist who is to illustrate this book , and who makes sad work of the likeness , will never be able to take my friend off he had what his friends would call a dumpy , but his mamma styled a neat little figure . His hair was of a healthy brown colour , which looks like gold in the sunshine , his face was round , rosy , freckled , and good - humoured , his whiskers when those facial ornaments for which he sighed so ardently were awarded to him by nature were decidedly of a reddish hue ; in fact , without being a beauty , he had such a frank , good - natured kind face , and laughed so merrily at you out of his honest blue eyes , that no wonder Mrs. Pendennis thought him the pride of the whole county . Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen he rose from five feet six to five feet eight inches in height , at which altitude he paused . But his mother wondered at it . He was three inches taller than his father . Was it possible that any man could grow to be three inches taller than Mr. Pendennis ? You may be certain he never went back to school ; the discipline of the establishment did not suit him , and he liked being at home much better . The question of his return was debated , and his uncle was for his going back . The Doctor wrote his opinion that it was most important for Arthur 's success in after - life that he should know a Greek play thoroughly , but Pen adroitly managed to hint to his mother what a dangerous place Greyfriars was , and what sad wild fellows some of the chaps there were , and the timid soul , taking alarm at once , acceded to his desire to stay at home . Then Pen 's uncle offered to use his influence with His Royal Highness the Commander - in - Chief , who was pleased to be very kind to him , and proposed to get Pen a commission in the Foot Guards . Pen 's heart leaped at this : he had been to hear the band at St. James 's play on a Sunday , when he went out to his uncle . He had seen Tom Ricketts , of the fourth form , who used to wear a jacket and trousers so ludicrously tight , that the elder boys could not forbear using him in the quality of a butt or ' cockshy ' - he had seen this very Ricketts arrayed in crimson and gold , with an immense bear - skin cap on his head , staggering under the colours of the regiment . Tom had recognised him and gave him a patronising nod . Tom , a little wretch whom he had cut over the back with a hockey - stick last quarter - and there he was in the centre of the square , rallying round the flag of his country , surrounded by bayonets , crossbelts , and scarlet , the band blowing trumpets and banging cymbals - talking familiarly to immense warriors with tufts to their chins and Waterloo medals . What would not Pen have given to wear such epaulettes and enter such a service ? But Helen Pendennis , when this point was proposed to her by her son , put on a face full of terror and alarm . She said she "
12389	13654	12378	12378	she	2307	" Now Pen would have as soon cut off his nose and ears as deliberately , and of aforethought malice , made his mother unhappy ; and , as he was of such a generous disposition that he would give away anything to any one , he instantly made a present of his visionary red coat and epaulettes and his ardour for military glory to his mother . She thought him the noblest creature in the world . But Major Pendennis , when the offer of the commission was acknowledged and refused , wrote back a curt and somewhat angry letter to the widow , and thought his nephew was rather a spooney . He was contented , however , when he saw the boy 's performances out hunting at Christmas , when the Major came down as usual to Fairoaks . Pen had a very good mare , and rode her with uncommon pluck and grace . He took his fences with great coolness , and yet with judgment , and without bravado . He wrote to the chaps at school about his top - boots , and his feats across country . He began to think seriously of a scarlet coat : and his mother must own that she thought it would become him remarkably well ; though , of course , she passed hours of anguish during his absence , and daily expected to see him brought home on a shutter . With these amusements , in rather too great plenty , it must not be assumed that Pen neglected his studies altogether . He had a natural taste for reading every possible kind of book which did not fall into his school - course . It was only when they forced his head into the waters of knowledge , that he refused to drink . He devoured all the books at home from Inchbald 's Theatre to White 's Farriery ; he ransacked the neighbouring book - cases . He found at Clavering an old cargo of French novels , which he read with all his might ; and he would sit for hours perched upon the topmost bar of Doctor Portman 's library steps with a folio on his knees , whether it were Hakluyt 's Travels , Hobbes 's Leviathan , Augustini Opera , or Chaucer 's Poems . He and the Vicar were very good friends , and from his Reverence , Pen learned that honest taste for port wine which distinguished him through life . And as for that dear good woman , Mrs. Portman , who was not in the least jealous , though her Doctor avowed himself in love with Mrs. Pendennis , whom he pronounced to be by far the finest lady in the county - all her grief was , as she looked up fondly at Pen perched on the book - ladder , that her daughter , Minny , was too old for him - as indeed she was - Miss Myra Portman being at that period only two years younger than Pen 's mother , and weighing as much as Pen and Mrs. Pendennis together . Are these details insipid ? Look back , good friend , at your own youth , and ask how was that ? I like to think of a well - nurtured boy , brave and gentle , warm - hearted and loving , and looking the world in the face with kind honest eyes . What bright colours it wore then , and how you enjoyed it ! A man has not many years of such time . He does not know them whilst they are with him . It is only when they are passed long away that he remembers how dear and happy they were . In order to keep Mr. Pen from indulging in that idleness of which his friend the Doctor of the Cistercians had prophesied such awful consequences , Mr. Smirke , Dr. Portman 's curate , was engaged at a liberal salary , to walk or ride over from Clavering and pass several hours daily with the young gentleman . Smirke was a man perfectly faultless at a tea - table , wore a curl on his fair forehead , and tied his neck - cloth with a melancholy grace . He was a decent scholar and mathematician , and taught Pen as much as the lad was ever disposed to learn , which was not much . For Pen had soon taken the measure of his tutor , who , when he came riding into the court - yard at Fairoaks on his pony , turned out his toes so absurdly , and left such a gap between his knees and the saddle , that it was impossible for any lad endowed with a sense of humour to respect such an equestrian . He nearly killed Smirke with terror by putting him on his mare , and taking him a ride over a common , where the county fox - hounds then bunted by that staunch old sportsman , Mr. Hardhead , of Dumplingbeare happened to meet . Mr. Smirke , on Pen 's mare , Rebecca she was named after Pen 's favourite heroine , the daughter of Isaac of York , astounded the hounds as much as he disgusted the huntsman , laming one of the former by persisting in riding amongst the pack , and receiving a speech from the latter , more remarkable for energy of language , than any oration he had ever heard since he left the bargemen on the banks of Isis . Smirke confided to his pupil his poems both Latin and English ; and presented to Mrs. Pendennis a volume of the latter , printed at Clapham , his native place . The two read the ancient poets together , and rattled through them at a pleasant rate , very different from that steady grubbing pace with which the Cistercians used to go over the classic ground , scenting out each word as they went , and digging up every root in the way . Pen never liked to halt , but made his tutor construe when he was at fault , and thus galloped through the Iliad and the Odyssey , the tragic playwriters , writers , and the charming wicked Aristophanes whom he vowed to be the greatest poet of all . But he went at such a pace that , though he certainly galloped through a considerable extent of the ancient country , he clean forgot it in after - life , and had only such a vague remembrance of his early classic course as a man has in the House of Commons , let us say , who still keeps up two or three quotations ; or a reviewer who , just for decency 's sake , hints at a little Greek . Our people are the most prosaic in the world , but the most faithful ; and with curious reverence we keep up and transmit , from generation to generation , the superstition of what we call the education of a gentleman . Besides the ancient poets , you may be sure Pen read the English with great gusto . Smirke sighed and shook his head sadly both about Byron and Moore . But Pen was a sworn fire - worshipper and a Corsair ; he had them by heart , and used to take little Laura into the window and say , "
13663	14645	13657	13657	I	0	" in tones so tragic that they caused the solemn little maid to open her great eyes still wider . She sat , until the proper hour for retirement , sewing at Mrs. Pendennis 's knee , and listening to Pen reading out to her of nights without comprehending one word of what he read . He read Shakspeare to his mother which she said she liked , but did n't , and Byron , and Pope , and his favourite Lalla Rookh , which pleased her indifferently . But as for Bishop Heber , and Mrs. Hemans above all , this lady used to melt right away , and be absorbed into her pocket - handkerchief , when Pen read those authors to her in his kind boyish voice . The ' Christian Year ' was a book which appeared about that time . The son and the mother whispered it to each other with awe - faint , very faint , and seldom in after - life Pendennis heard that solemn church - music : but he always loved the remembrance of it , and of the times when it struck on his heart , and he walked over the fields full of hope and void of doubt , as the church - bells rang on Sunday morning . It was at this period of his existence , that Pen broke out in the Poets ' Corner of the County Chronicle , with some verses with which he was perfectly well satisfied . His are the verses signed ' NEP . , ' addressed ' To a Tear ; ' ' On the Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo ; ' ' To Madame Caradori singing at the Assize Meetings ; ' ' On Saint Bartholomew 's Day ' a tremendous denunciation of Popery , and a solemn warning to the people of England to rally against emancipating the Roman Catholics , etc . , etc . - all which masterpieces , Mrs. Pendennis no doubt keeps to this day , along with his first socks , the first cutting of his hair , his bottle , and other interesting relics of his infancy . He used to gallop Rebecca over the neighbouring Dumpling Downs , or into the county town , which , if you please , we shall call Chatteris , spouting his own poems , and filled with quite a Byronic afflatus as he thought . His genius at this time was of a decidedly gloomy cast . He brought his mother a tragedy , in which , though he killed sixteen people before the second act , it made her laugh so , that he thrust the masterpiece into the fire in a pet . He projected an epic poem in blank verse , ' Cortez , or the Conqueror of Mexico , and the Inca 's Daughter . ' He wrote part of ' Seneca , or the Fatal Bath , ' and ' Ariadne in Naxos ; ' classical pieces , with choruses and strophes and antistrophes , which sadly puzzled poor Mrs. Pendennis ; and began a ' History of the Jesuits , ' in which he lashed that Order with tremendous severity , and warned his Protestant fellow - countrymen of their machinations . His loyalty did his mother 's heart good to witness . He was a staunch , unflinching Church - and - King man in those days ; and at the election , when Sir Giles Beanfield stood on the Blue interest , against Lord Trehawk , Lord Eyrie 's son , a Whig and a friend of Popery , Arthur Pendennis , with an immense bow for himself , which his mother made , and with a blue ribbon for Rebecca , rode alongside of the Reverend Doctor Portman , on his grey mare Dowdy , and at the head of the Clavering voters , whom the Doctor brought up to plump for the Protestant Champion . On that day Pen made his first speech at the Blue Hotel : and also , it appears , for the first time in his life - took a little more wine than was good for him . Mercy ! what a scene it was at Fairoaks , when he rode back at ever so much o'clock at night . What moving about of lanterns in the court - yard and stables , though the moon was shining out ; what a gathering of servants , as Pen came home , clattering over the bridge and up the stableyard , with half a score of the Clavering voters yelling after him the Blue song of the election . He wanted them all to come in and have some wine - some very good Madeira - some capital Madeira - John , go and get some Madeira , - and there is no knowing what the farmers would have done , had not Madam Pendennis made her appearance in a white wrapper , with a candle - and scared those zealous Blues so by the sight of her pale handsome face , that they touched their hats and rode off . Besides these amusements and occupations in which Mr. Pen indulged , there was one which forms the main business and pleasure of youth , if the poets tell us aright , whom Pen was always studying ; and this young fellow 's heart was so ardent , and his imagination so eager , that it is not to be expected he should long escape the passion to which we allude , and which , ladies , you have rightly guessed to be that of Love . Pen sighed for it first in secret , and , like the love - sick swain in Ovid , opened his breast and said , "
14650	14986	14648	14648	veni	2313	" What generous youth is there that has not courted some such windy mistress in his time ? Yes , Pen began to feel the necessity of a first love - of a consuming passion - of an object on which he could concentrate all those vague floating fancies under which he sweetly suffered - of a young lady to whom he could really make verses , and whom he could set up and adore , in place of those unsubstantial Ianthes and Zuleikas to whom he addressed the outpourings of his gushing muse . He read his favourite poems over and over again , he called upon Alma Venus the delight of gods and men , he translated Anacreon 's odes , and picked out passages suitable to his complaint from Waller , Dryden , Prior , and the like . Smirke and he were never weary , in their interviews , of discoursing about love . The faithless tutor entertained him with sentimental conversations in place of lectures on algebra and Greek ; for Smirke was in love too . Who could help it , being in daily intercourse with such a woman ? Smirke was madly in love as far as such a mild flame as Mr. Smirke 's may be called madness with Mrs. Pendennis . That honest lady , sitting down below stairs teaching little Laura to play the piano , or devising flannel petticoats for the poor round about her , or otherwise busied with the calm routine of her modest and spotless Christian life , was little aware what storms were brewing in two bosoms upstairs in the study - in Pen 's , as he sate in his shooting jacket , with his elbows on the green study - table , and his hands clutching his curly brown hair , Homer under his nose , - and in worthy Mr. Smirke 's , with whom he was reading . Here they would talk about Helen and Andromache . "
14993	14999	15001	15001	I	0	" Pen used to avouch ; "
15018	15194	15008	15008	I	0	" and he would spout certain favourite lines which the reader will find in their proper place in the third book . He drew portraits of her - they are extant still - with straight noses and enormous eyes , and ' Arthur Pendennis delineavit et pinxit ' gallantly written underneath . As for Mr. Smirke he naturally preferred Andromache . And in consequence he was uncommonly kind to Pen . He gave him his Elzevir Horace , of which the boy was fond , and his little Greek Testament which his own mamma at Clapham had purchased and presented to him . He bought him a silver pencil - case ; and in the matter of learning let him do just as much or as little as ever he pleased . He always seemed to be on the point of unbosoming himself to Pen : nay , he confessed to the latter that he had a - an attachment , an ardently cherished attachment , about which Pendennis longed to hear , and said , "
15213	16556	16557	16557	Hallo	800	" But Doctor Portman 's curate , heaving a gentle sigh , cast up his eyes to the ceiling , and begged Pen faintly to change the conversation . Poor Smirke ! He invited Pen to dine at his lodgings over Madame Fribsby 's , the milliner 's , in Clavering ; and once when it was raining , and Mrs. Pendennis , who had driven in her pony - chaise into Clavering with respect to some arrangements , about leaving off mourning probably , was prevailed upon to enter the curate 's apartments , he sent out for pound - cakes instantly . The sofa on which she sate became sacred to him from that day : and he kept flowers in the glass which she drank from ever after . As Mrs. Pendennis was never tired of hearing the praises of her son , we may be certain that this rogue of a tutor neglected no opportunity of conversing with her upon that subject . It might be a little tedious to him to hear the stories about Pen 's generosity , about his bravery in fighting the big naughty boy , about his fun and jokes , about his prodigious skill in Latin , music , riding , etc . , but what price would he not pay to be in her company ? and the widow , after these conversations , thought Mr. Smirke a very pleasing and well - informed man . As for her son , she had not settled in her mind whether he was to be Senior Wrangler and Archbishop of Canterbury , or Double First Class at Oxford , and Lord Chancellor . That all England did not possess his peer , was a fact about which there was , in her mind , no manner of question . A simple person , of inexpensive habits , she began forthwith to save , and , perhaps , to be a little parsimonious , in favour of her boy . There were no entertainments , of course , at Fairoaks , during the year of her weeds . Nor , indeed , did the Doctor 's silver dish - covers , of which he was so proud , and which were flourished all over with the arms of the Pendennises , and surmounted with their crest , come out of the plate - chests again for long , long years . The household was diminished , and its expenses curtailed . There was a very blank anchorite repast when Pen dined from home : and he himself headed the remonstrance from the kitchen regarding the deteriorated quality of the Fairoaks beer . She was becoming miserly for Pen . Indeed , who ever accused women of being just ? They are always sacrificing themselves or somebody for somebody else 's sake . There happened to be no young woman in the small circle of friends who were in the widow 's intimacy whom Pendennis could by any possibility gratify by endowing her with the inestimable treasure of a heart which he was longing to give away . Some young fellows in this predicament bestow their young affections upon Dolly , the dairymaid , or cast the eyes of tenderness upon Molly , the blacksmith 's daughter . Pen thought a Pendennis much too grand a personage to stoop so low . He was too high - minded for a vulgar intrigue , and , at the idea of an intrigue or a seduction , had he ever entertained it , his heart would have revolted as from the notion of any act of baseness or dishonour . Miss Minny Portman was too old , too large , and too fond of reading ' Rollin 's Ancient History . ' The Miss Boardbacks , Admiral Boardback 's daughters of St. Vincent 's , or Fourth of June House , as it was called , disgusted Pen with the London airs which they brought into the country , from Gloucester Place , where they passed the season , and looked down upon Pen as a chit . Captain Glanders 's H.P. , 50th Dragoon Guards three girls were in brown - holland pinafores as yet , with the ends of their hair - plaits tied up in dirty pink ribbon . Not having acquired the art of dancing , the youth avoided such chances as he might have had of meeting with the fair sex at the Chatteris ' Assemblies ; in fine , he was not in love , because there was nobody at hand to fall in love with . And the young monkey used to ride out , day after day in quest , of Dulcinea ; and peep into the pony - chaises and gentlefolks ' carriages , as they drove along the broad turnpike roads , with a heart beating within him , and a secret tremor and hope that she might be in that yellow postchaise coming swinging up the hill , or one of those three girls in beaver bonnets in the back seat of the double gig , which the fat old gentleman in black was driving , at four miles an hour . The postchaise contained a snuffy old dowager of seventy , with a maid , her contemporary . The three girls in the beaver bonnets were no handsomer than the turnips that skirted the roadside . Do as he might , and ride where he would , the fairy princess that he was to rescue and win , had not yet appeared to honest Pen . Upon these points he did not discourse to his mother . He had a world of his own . What generous , ardent , imaginative soul has not a secret pleasure - place in which it disports ? Let no clumsy prying or dull meddling of ours try to disturb it in our children . Actaeon was a brute for wanting to push in where Diana was bathing . Leave him occasionally alone , my good madam , if you have a poet for a child . Even your admirable advice may be a bore sometimes . You are faultless ; but it does not follow that everybody in your family is to think exactly like yourself . Yonder little child may have thoughts too deep even for your great mind , and fancies so coy and timid that they will not bare themselves when your ladyship sits by . Helen Pendennis by the force of sheer love divined a great number of her son 's secrets . But she kept these things in her heart if we may so speak , and did not speak of them . Besides , she had made up her mind that he was to marry little Laura , who would be eighteen when Pen was six - and - twenty : and had finished his college career , and had made his grand tour , and was settled either in London , astonishing all the metropolis by his learning and eloquence at the bar , or better still in a sweet country parsonage surrounded with hollyhocks and roses , close to a delightful romantic ivy - covered church , from the pulpit of which Pen would utter the most beautiful sermons ever preached . While these natural sentiments were waging war and trouble in honest Pen 's bosom , it chanced one day that he rode into Chatteris , for the purpose of carrying to the County Chronicle a tremendous and thrilling poem for the next week 's paper ; and putting up his horse according to custom , at the stables of the George Hotel there , he fell in with an old acquaintance . A grand black tandem , with scarlet wheels , came rattling into the inn yard , as Pen stood there in converse with the hostler about Rebecca ; and the voice of the driver called out , "
16565	16689	16563	16563	you	673	" in a loud patronising manner . Pen had some difficulty in recognising under the broad - brimmed hat and the vast great - coats and neckcloths , with which the new - comer was habited , the person and figure of his quondam schoolfellow , Mr. Foker . A year 's absence had made no small difference in that gentleman . A youth who had been deservedly whipped a few months previously , and who spent his pocket - money on tarts and hardbake , now appeared before Pen in one of those costumes to which the public consent , that I take to be quite as influential in this respect as ' Johnson 's Dictionary , ' has awarded the title of "
16814	16823	16824	16825	Mr. Foker	801	" Left that place for good , Pendennis ? "
16838	16847	16848	16848	Pen	799	" Yes , this year - or more , "
16851	16856	16848	16848	Pen	799	" Beastly old hole , "
16861	16888	16857	16858	Mr. Foker	801	" Hate it . Hate the Doctor : hate Towzer , the second master ; hate everybody there . Not a fit place for a gentleman . "
16889	16894	16896	16896	Pen	799	" Not at all , "
16906	16926	16927	16927	Foker	801	" By gad , sir , I sometimes dream , now , that the Doctor 's walking into me , "
16946	17023	16933	16933	he	799	" When I think of the diet there , by gad , sir , I wonder how I stood it . Mangy mutton , brutal beef ; pudding on Thursdays and Sundays , and that fit to poison you . Just look at my leader - did you ever see a prettier animal ? Drove over from Baymouth . Came the nine mile in two - and - forty minutes . Not bad going , sir . "
17024	17033	17034	17034	Pendennis	673	" Are you stopping at Baymouth , Foker ? "
17037	17043	17045	17046	the other	14365	" I 'm coaching there , "
17052	17055	17057	17057	Pen	799	" What ? "
17076	17098	17068	17068	Foker	801	" He was blowed if he did n't think Pen was such a flat as not to know what coaching meant . "
17099	17168	17170	17171	Mr. Foker	801	" I 'm come down with a coach from Oxford . A tutor , do n't you see , old boy ? He 's coaching me , and some other men , for the little go . Me and Spavin have the drag between us . And I thought I 'd just tool over and go to the play . Did you ever see Rowkins do the hornpipe ? "
17507	17512	17514	17514	he	801	" Have a drop , "
17518	17560	17514	17514	he	801	" it 's recommended to me by the faculty as a what - do - you - call-'em - a stomatic , old boy . Give the young one a glass , R. , and score it up to yours truly . "
18226	18236	18238	18238	Pen	799	" An old schoolfellow of mine , Mr. Foker , "
18243	18245	18240	18241	The Doctor	13989	" H'm "
18274	18283	18284	18285	the Doctor	13989	" I came up on Bishop 's business , "
18288	18300	18284	18285	the Doctor	13989	" We 'll ride home , Arthur , if you like ? "
18301	18312	18313	18313	Pen	799	" I - I 'm engaged to my friend here , "
18316	18325	18327	18328	the Doctor	13989	" You had better come home with me , "
18330	18340	18327	18328	the Doctor	13989	" His mother knows he 's out , sir , "
18345	18352	18341	18342	Mr. Foker	801	" do n't she , Pendennis ? "
18353	18369	18370	18371	the Doctor	13989	" But that does not prove that he had not better come home with me , "
18382	18394	18395	18395	Foker	801	" Old boy do n't like the weed , I suppose , "
18398	18427	18395	18395	Foker	801	" Ha ! who 's here ? - here 's the General , and Bingley , the manager . How do , Cos ? How do , Bingley ? "
18428	18438	18440	18445	the gentleman addressed as the General	2396	" How does my worthy and gallant young Foker ? "
18469	18481	18483	18485	the other gentleman	2399	" Trust you are very well , my very dear sir , "
18487	18519	18483	18485	the other gentleman	2399	" and that the Theatre Royal will have the honour of your patronage to - night . We perform ' The Stranger , ' in which your humble servant will - - "
18520	18532	18533	18535	young Mr. Foker	801	" Ca n't stand you in tights and Hessians , Bingley , "
18550	18571	18540	18546	the General , with the Irish accent	2400	" But I think ye'll like Miss Fotheringay , in Mrs. Haller , or me name 's not Jack Costigan . "
18889	18919	18920	18920	Foker	801	" A bottle of sherry , a bottle of sham , a bottle of port and a shass caffy , it ai n't so bad , hay , Pen ? "
18946	18949	18950	18950	Pen	799	" toddle . "
18990	19007	19008	19008	Foker	801	" Mrs. Dropsicum , Bingley 's mother - in - law , great in Lady Macbeth , "
19048	19058	19016	19016	her	2425	" universal burst of attraction and galvanic thrills of delight "

19701	19731	19699	19699	Francis	693	" thus it is , from morn to night . To him nature has no beauty - life no charm . For three years I have never seen him smile "
19750	19779	19781	19782	Tobias Goll	829	" Nothing diverts him . O , if he would but attach himself to any living thing , were it an animal - for something man must love . "
19790	19820	19787	19787	He	829	" O , how refreshing , after seven long weeks , to feel these warm sunbeams once again . Thanks , bounteous heaven , for the joy I taste ! "
19845	19871	19872	19872	Bingley	817	" This old man 's share of earthly happiness can be but little . Yet mark how grateful he is for his portion of it . "
19874	19892	19893	19893	He	829	" Because though old , he is but a child in the leading - string of hope . "
19918	19926	19927	19927	Bingley	817	" Hope is the nurse of life . "
19929	19938	19939	19940	The Stranger	14776	" And her cradle - is the grave . "
20108	20113	20103	20103	his	801	" Bravo , Bingley ! "
20114	20130	20131	20132	Mr. Foker	801	" Give him a hand , Pendennis ; you know every chap likes a hand , "
20192	20200	20202	20202	Foker	801	" That 's Hicks and Miss Thackthwaite , "
20204	20226	20202	20202	Foker	801	" Pretty girl , ai n't she , Pendennis ? But stop - hurray - bravo ! here 's the Fotheringay . "
20357	20359	20364	20365	Mrs. Haller	819	" bravo "
21011	21023	21006	21006	Pen	799	" I say , Pen , is n't she a stunner ? "
21028	21031	21032	21032	Pen	799	" Hush ! "
21040	21372	21032	21032	Pen	799	" She began her business in a deep sweet voice . Those who know the play of the ' Stranger , ' are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves , either for their sound sense , their novelty of observation , or their poetic fancy . In fact , if a man were to say it was a stupid play , he would not be far wrong . Nobody ever talked so . If we meet idiots in life , as will happen , it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words . The Stranger 's talk is sham , like the book he reads and the hair he wears , and the bank he sits on , and the diamond ring he makes play with - but , in the midst of the balderdash , there runs that reality of love , children , and forgiveness of wrong , which will be listened to wherever it is preached , and sets all the world sympathising . With what smothered sorrow , with what gushing pathos , Mrs. Haller delivered her part ! At first , when as Count Wintersen 's housekeeper , and preparing for his Excellency 's arrival , she has to give orders about the beds and furniture , and the dinner , etc . , to be got ready , she did so with the calm agony of despair . But when she could get rid of the stupid servants and give vent to her feelings to the pit and the house , she overflowed to each individual as if he were her particular confidant , and she was crying out her griefs on his shoulder : the little fiddler in the orchestra whom she did not seem to watch , though he followed her ceaselessly twitched , twisted , nodded , pointed about , and when she came to the favourite passage , "
21435	21456	21413	21413	thou	2518	" when she came to this passage little Bows buried his face in his blue cotton handkerchief , after crying out "
21459	21798	21799	21799	She	2521	" All the house was affected . Foker , for his part , taking out a large yellow bandanna , wept piteously . As for Pen , he was gone too far for that . He followed the woman about and about - when she was off the stage , it and the house were blank ; the lights and the red officers , reeled wildly before his sight . He watched her at the side - scene - where she stood waiting to come on the stage , and where her father took off her shawl : when the reconciliation arrived , and she flung herself down on Mr. Bingley 's shoulders , whilst the children clung to their knees , and the Countess Mrs. Bingley and Baron Steinforth performed with great liveliness and spirit by Garbetts - while the rest of the characters formed a group round them , Pen 's hot eyes only saw Fotheringay , Fotheringay . The curtain fell upon him like a pall . He did not hear a word of what Bingley said , who came forward to announce the play for the next evening , and who took the tumultuous applause , as usual , for himself . Pen was not even distinctly aware that the house was calling for Miss Fotheringay , nor did the manager seem to comprehend that anybody else but himself had caused the success of the play . At last he understood it - stepped back with a grin , and presently appeared with Mrs. Haller on his arm . How beautiful she looked ! Her hair had fallen down , the officers threw her flowers . She clutched them to her heart . She put back her hair , and smiled all round . Her eyes met Pen 's . Down went the curtain again : and she was gone . Not one note could he hear of the overture which the brass band of the dragoons blew by kind permission of Colonel Swallowtail . "
21809	21987	21799	21799	She	2521	" Mr. Foker asked of his companion . Pen did not know exactly what Foker said , and answered vaguely . He could not tell the other what he felt ; he could not have spoken , just then , to any mortal . Besides , Pendennis did not quite know what he felt yet ; it was something overwhelming , maddening , delicious ; a fever of wild joy and undefined longing . And now Rowkins and Miss Thackthwaite came on to dance the favourite double hornpipe , and Foker abandoned himself to the delights of this ballet , just as he had to the tears of the tragedy , a few minutes before . Pen did not care for it , or indeed think about the dance , except to remember that that woman was acting with her in the scene where she first came in . It was a mist before his eyes . At the end of the dance he looked at his watch and said it was time for him to go . "
22002	22006	21994	22000	The Bravo of the Battle - Axe	2523	" Foker said , "
22047	22276	21994	22000	The Bravo of the Battle - Axe	2523	" Pen looked at the bill with one lingering fond hope that Miss Fotheringay 's name might be hidden , somewhere , in the list of the actors of the after - piece , but there was no such name . Go he must . He had a long ride home . He squeezed Foker 's hand . He was choking to speak , but he could n't . He quitted the theatre and walked frantically about the town , he knew not how long ; then he mounted at the George and rode homewards , and Clavering clock sang out one as he came into the yard at Fairoaks . The lady of the house might have been awake , but she only heard him from the passage outside his room as he dashed into bed and pulled the clothes over his head . Pen had not been in the habit of passing wakeful nights , so he at once fell off into a sound sleep . Even in later days and with a great deal of care and other thoughtful matter to keep him awake , a man from long practice or fatigue or resolution begins by going to sleep as usual : and gets a nap in advance of Anxiety . But she soon comes up with him and jogs his shoulder , and says , "
22299	22383	22384	22384	My	0	" Then they fall to together in the midnight . Well , whatever might afterwards happen to him , poor little Pen was not come to this state yet ; he tumbled into a sound sleep - did not wake until an early hour in the morning , when the rooks began to caw from the little wood beyond his bedroom windows ; and - at that very instant and as his eyes started open , the beloved image was in his mind . "
22388	22394	22395	22395	you	2526	" he heard her say , "
22475	23488	22471	22471	I	0	" Was Pen frightened at the summons ? Not he . He did not know what was coming : it was all wild pleasure and delight as yet . And as , when three years previously , and on entering the fifth form at the Cistercians , his father had made him a present of a gold watch which the boy took from under his pillow and examined on the instant of waking : for ever rubbing and polishing it up in private and retiring into corners to listen to its ticking : so the young man exulted over his new delight ; felt in his waistcoat pocket to see that it was safe ; wound it up at nights , and at the very first moment of waking hugged it and looked at it . - By the way , that first watch of Pen 's was a showy ill - manufactured piece : it never went well from the beginning , and was always getting out of order . And after putting it aside into a drawer and forgetting it for some time , he swapped it finally away for a more useful time - keeper . Pen felt himself to be ever so many years older since yesterday . There was no mistake about it now . He was as much in love as the best hero in the best romance he ever read . He told John to bring his shaving water with the utmost confidence . He dressed himself in some of his finest clothes that morning : and came splendidly down to breakfast , patronising his mother and little Laura , who had been strumming her music lesson for hours before ; and who after he had read the prayers of which he did not heed one single syllable wondered at his grand appearance , and asked him to tell her what the play was about ? Pen laughed and declined to tell Laura what the play was about . In fact it was quite as well that she should not know . Then she asked him why he had got on his fine pin and beautiful new waistcoat ? Pen blushed and told his mother that the old schoolfellow with whom he had dined at Chatteris was reading with a tutor at Baymouth , a very learned man ; and as he was himself to go to College , and as there were several young men pursuing their studies at Baymouth - he was anxious to ride over - and - and just see what the course of their reading was . Laura made a long face . Helen Pendennis looked hard at her son , troubled more than ever with the vague doubt and terror which had been haunting her ever since the last night , when Farmer Gurnett brought back the news that Pen would not return home to dinner . Arthur 's eyes defied her . She tried to console herself , and drive off her fears . The boy had never told her an untruth . Pen conducted himself during breakfast in a very haughty and supercilious manner ; and , taking leave of the elder and younger lady , was presently heard riding out of the stablecourt . He went gently at first , but galloped like a madman as soon as he thought that he was out of hearing . Smirke , thinking of his own affairs , and softly riding with his toes out , to give Pen his three hours ' reading at Fairoaks , met his pupil , who shot by him like the wind . Smirke 's pony shied , as the other thundered past him ; the gentle curate went over his head among the stinging - nettles in the hedge . Pen laughed as they met , pointed towards the Baymouth road , and was gone half a mile in that direction before poor Smirke had picked himself up . Pen had resolved in his mind that he must see Foker that morning ; he must hear about her ; know about her ; be with somebody who knew her ; and honest Smirke , for his part , sitting up among the stinging - nettles , as his pony cropped quietly in the hedge , thought dismally to himself , ought he to go to Fairoaks now that his pupil was evidently gone away for the day . Yes , he thought he might go , too . He might go and ask Mrs. Pendennis when Arthur would be back ; and hear Miss Laura her Watts 's Catechism . He got up on the little pony - both were used to his slipping off - and advanced upon the house from which his scholar had just rushed away in a whirlwind . Thus love makes fools of all of us , big and little ; and the curate had tumbled over head and heels in pursuit of it , and Pen had started in the first heat of the mad race . CHAPTER V Mrs. Haller at Home Without slackening her pace , Rebecca the mare galloped on to Baymouth , where Pen put her up at the inn stables , and ran straightway to Mr. Foker 's lodgings , which he knew from the direction given to him by that gentleman on the previous day . On reaching these apartments , which were over a chemist 's shop whose stock of cigars and sodawater went off rapidly by the kind patronage of his young inmates , Pen only found Mr. Spavin , Foker 's friend , and part owner of the tandem which the latter had driven into Chatteris , who was smoking , and teaching a little dog , a friend of his , tricks with a bit of biscuit . Pen 's healthy red face , fresh from the gallop , compared oddly with the waxy debauched little features of Foker 's chum ; the latter remarked it . "
23494	23498	23499	23499	he	2528	" he thought , "
23523	23746	23507	23507	His	2528	" Foker had not come home at all . Here was a disappointment ! - Mr. Spavin could not say when his friend would return . Sometimes he stopped a day , sometimes a week . Of what college was Pen ? Would he have anything ? There was a very fair tap of ale . Mr. Spavin was enabled to know Pendennis 's name , on the card which the latter took out and laid down perhaps Pen in these days was rather proud of having a card - and so the young men took leave . Then Pen went down the rock , and walked about on the sand , biting his nails by the shore of the much - sounding sea . It stretched before him bright and immeasurable . The blue waters came rolling into the bay , foaming and roaring hoarsely : Pen looked them in the face with blank eyes , hardly regarding them . What a tide there was pouring into the lad 's own mind at the time , and what a little power had he to check it ! Pen flung stones into the sea , but it still kept coming on . He was in a rage at not seeing Foker . He wanted to see Foker . He must see Foker . "
23766	23885	23886	23886	he	2530	" Pen thought . Rebecca was saddled in another half hour , and galloping on the grass by the Chatteris road . About four miles from Baymouth , the Clavering road branches off , as everybody knows , and the mare naturally was for taking that turn , but , cutting her over the shoulder , Pen passed the turning , and rode on to the turnpike without seeing any sign of the black tandem and red wheels . As he was at the turnpike he might as well go on : that was quite clear . So Pen rode to the George , and the hostler told him that Mr. Foker was there sure enough , and that "
23925	23934	23916	23916	he	2530	" the man added , with a grin . "
23949	23983	23936	23936	you	2533	" he added , in a very satirical manner , to Mr. Foker 's domestic , who here came down the yard bearing his master 's clothes , most beautifully brushed and arranged . "
23992	24047	23985	23986	Mr. Pendennis	685	" and Pen followed the man at last to the apartment , where , in the midst of an immense bed , Mr. Harry Foker lay reposing . The feather bed and bolsters swelled up all round Mr. Foker , so that you could hardly see his little sallow face and red silk nightcap . "
24050	24054	23985	23986	Mr. Pendennis	685	" said Pen . "
24064	24073	24059	24059	brother	2536	" sang out the voice from the bed . "
24107	24108	24105	24105	Stoopid	845	" "
24129	24145	24127	24127	sir	2261	" the man answered , who received all Mr. Foker 's remarks with perfect gravity . "
24176	24177	24180	24180	sir	2261	" "
24190	24270	24188	24188	sir	2261	" said Stoopid , still with perfect gravity . He was arranging Mr. Foker 's dressing - case - a trunk , the gift of a fond mother , without which the young fellow never travelled . It contained a prodigious apparatus in plate ; a silver dish , a silver mug , silver boxes and bottles for all sorts of essences , and a choice of razors ready against the time when Mr. Foker 's beard should come . "
24277	24295	24338	24338	Pen	799	" said the young fellow , yawning and throwing up his little lean arms over his head . "
24340	24341	24338	24338	Pen	799	" "
24348	24357	24342	24345	The man we met	2548	" said Pen , all in a tremor , "
24363	24364	24342	24345	The man we met	2548	" "
24382	24383	24380	24380	Pen	799	" "
24437	24438	24434	24434	sir	2261	" "
24445	24446	24449	24449	sir	2261	" "
24451	24452	24449	24449	sir	2261	" "
24461	24467	24469	24469	she	2551	" cried the little sluggard , "
24521	24540	24500	24500	I	0	" - and the young fellow burst out into a boyish laugh of enjoyment . Then he added - "
24576	25188	24553	24553	I	0	" Pen went off in great perturbation , to meet Mr. Costigan , and Mr. Foker commenced his toilet . Of Mr. Foker 's two grandfathers , the one from whom he inherited a fortune was a brewer ; the other was an earl , who endowed him with the most doting mother in the world . The Fokers had been at the Cistercian school from father to son ; at which place , our friend , whose name could be seen over the playground wall , on a public - house sign , under which ' Foker 's Entire ' was painted , had been dreadfully bullied on account of his trade , his uncomely countenance , his inaptitude for learning and cleanliness , his gluttony and other weak points . But those who know how a susceptible youth , under the tyranny of his schoolfellows , becomes silent and a sneak , may understand how in a very few months after his liberation from bondage , he developed himself as he had done ; and became the humorous , the sarcastic , the brilliant Foker , with whom we have made acquaintance . A dunce he always was , it is true ; for learning can not be acquired by leaving school and entering at college as a fellow - commoner ; but he was now in his own peculiar manner as great a dandy as he before had been a slattern , and when he entered his sitting - room to join his two guests , arrived scented and arrayed in fine linen , and perfectly splendid in appearance . General or Captain Costigan - for the latter was the rank which he preferred to assume - was seated in the window with the newspaper held before him at arm 's length . The Captain 's eyes were somewhat dim ; and he was spelling the paper , with the help of his lips , as well as of those bloodshot eyes of his , as you see gentlemen do to whom reading is a rare and difficult occupation . His hat was cocked very much on one ear ; and as one of his feet lay up in the window - seat , the observer of such matters might remark , by the size and shabbiness of the boots which the Captain wore , that times did not go very well with him . Poverty seems as if it were disposed , before it takes possession of a man entirely , to attack his extremities first : the coverings of his head , feet , and hands are its first prey . All these parts of the Captain 's person were particularly rakish and shabby . As soon as he saw Pen he descended from the window - seat and saluted the new - comer , first in a military manner , by conveying a couple of his fingers covered with a broken black glove to his hat , and then removing that ornament altogether . The Captain was inclined to be bald , but he brought a quantity of lank iron - grey hair over his pate , and had a couple of whisps of the same falling down on each side of his face . Much whisky had spoiled what complexion Mr. Costigan may have possessed in his youth . His once handsome face had now a copper tinge . He wore a very high stock , scarred and stained in many places ; and a dress - coat tightly buttoned up in those parts where the buttons had not parted company from the garment . "
25207	25222	25223	25223	I	0	" said the Captain , with a splendid bow and wave of his hat . "
25350	25424	25425	25425	I	0	" And he pulled out an old snuff box , which he presented with a stately air to his new acquaintance . Arthur was a great deal too much flurried to speak . This shabby - looking buck was - was her father . The Captain was perfumed with the recollections of the last night 's cigars , and pulled and twisted the tuft on his chin as jauntily as any young dandy . "
25439	25446	25447	25447	She	675	" Pen said , flushing up . "
25485	25490	25476	25476	she	675	" he gasped out . "
25504	25509	25498	25498	ye	2587	" cried the Captain . "
25623	25624	25609	25609	himself	2599	" "
25636	25640	25609	25609	himself	2599	" Pen said . "
25704	25719	25701	25701	you	2261	" ? he added , after a pause , and with a pathetic whisper , "
25763	26393	26396	26396	sir	2261	" Now the Captain 's means were so small as to be , it may be said , quite invisible . But nobody knows how the wind is tempered to shorn Irish lambs , and in what marvellous places they find pasture . If Captain Costigan , whom I had the honour to know , would but have told his history , it would have been a great moral story . But he neither would have told it if he could , nor could if he would ; for the Captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truth , - he was unable even to think it - and fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy , whiskified brain . He began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours , a fine person and legs , and one of the most beautiful voices in the world . To his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful Irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy : and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos . Poor Cos ! he was at once brave and maudlin , humorous and an idiot ; always good - natured , and sometimes almost trustworthy . Up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man , and back any man 's bill : and his end was in a spunging - house , where the sheriff 's officer , who took him , was fond of him . In his brief morning of life , Cos formed the delight of regimental messes , and had the honour of singing his songs , bacchanalian and sentimental , at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commanders - in - chief , in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him , and spent his doubtful patrimony . What became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army , is no affair of ours . I take it , no foreigner understands the life of an Irish gentleman without money , the way in which he manages to keep afloat - the wind - raising conspiracies , in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himself - the means by which he contrives , during most days of the week , to get his portion of whisky - and - water : all these are mysteries to us inconceivable : but suffice it to say , that through all the storms of life Jack had floated somehow , and the lamp of his nose had never gone out . Before he and Pen had had a half - hour 's conversation , the Captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughter 's benefit , which was to take place speedily ; and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year , when poor Miss Fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture ; but was an arrangement with the manager , by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets , keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold . Pen had but two pounds in his purse , and he handed them over to the Captain for the tickets ; he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latter 's delicacy . Costigan scrawled him an order for a box , lightly slipped the sovereigns into his waistcoat , and slapped his hand over the place where they lay . They seemed to warm his old sides . "
26398	26402	26396	26396	sir	2261	" said he , "
26455	26801	26803	26807	the company I 'm in	2613	" And he straightway poured out to Pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk , the bets made , the races ridden by the garrison there , with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast . Then it was good to see the Captain 's behaviour before the devilled turkey and the mutton chops ! His stories poured forth unceasingly , and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men . When he got a bit of sunshine , the old lazzarone basked in it ; he prated about his own affairs and past splendour , and all the lords , generals , and Lord - Lieutenants he had ever known . He described the death of his darling Bessie , the late Mrs. Costigan , and the challenge he had sent to Captain Shanty Clancy , of the Slashers , for looking rude at Miss Fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the Phaynix ; and then he described how the Captain apologised , gave a dinner at the Kildare Street , where six of them drank twinty - one bottles of claret , etc . He announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldier 's existence ; and having had a second glass of Curacoa , was so happy that he began to cry . Altogether we should say that the Captain was not a man of much strength of mind , or a very eligible companion for youth ; but there are worse men , holding much better places in life , and more dishonest , who have never committed half so many rogueries as he . They walked out , the Captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends , and in a maudlin state of contentment . He winked at one or two tradesmen 's shops where , possibly , he owed a bill , as much as to say , "
26818	26922	26810	26810	I	0	" - and they parted finally with Mr. Foker at a billiard - room , where the latter had a particular engagement with some gentlemen of Colonel Swallowtail 's regiment . Pen and the shabby Captain still walked the street together ; the Captain , in his sly way , making inquiries about Mr. Foker 's fortune and station in life . Pen told him how Foker 's father was a celebrated brewer , and his mother was Lady Agnes Milton , Lord Rosherville 's daughter . The Captain broke out into a strain of exaggerated compliment and panegyric about Mr. Foker , whose "
26926	26930	26949	26949	he	2616	" he said , "
26960	27539	26949	26949	he	2616	" - in not one word of which speech did the Captain accurately believe . Pen walked on , listening to his companion 's prate , wondering , amused , and puzzled . It had not as yet entered into the boy 's head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him ; and being of a candid nature himself , he took naturally for truth what other people told him . Costigan had never had a better listener , and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man . So much pleased was he with the young gentleman , so artless , honest , and cheerful did Pen seem to be , that the Captain finally made him an invitation , which he very seldom accorded to young men , and asked Pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode , which was near at hand , where the Captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther , Miss Fotheringay ? Pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation , and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him , that he thought he should have dropped from the Captain 's arm at first , and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion . He gasped out a few incoherent words , indicative of the high gratification he should have in being presented to the lady for whose - for whose talents he had conceived such an admiration - such an extreme admiration ; and followed the Captain , scarcely knowing whither that gentleman led him . He was going to see her ! He was going to see her ! In her was the centre of the universe . She was the kernel of the world for Pen . Yesterday , before he knew her , seemed a period ever so long ago - a revolution was between him and that time , and a new world about to begin . The Captain conducted his young friend to that quiet little street in Chatteris , which is called Prior 's Lane , which lies in the ecclesiastical quarter of the town , close by Dean 's Green and the canons ' houses , and is overlooked by the enormous towers of the cathedral ; there the Captain dwelt modestly in the first floor of a low gabled house , on the door of which was the brass plate of ' Creed , Tailor and Robe - maker . ' Creed was dead , however . His widow was a pew - opener in the cathedral hard by ; his eldest son was a little scamp of a choir - boy , who played toss - halfpenny , led his little brothers into mischief , and had a voice as sweet as an angel . A couple of the latter were sitting on the door - step , down which you went into the passage of the house ; and they jumped up with great alacrity to meet their lodger , and plunged wildly , and rather to Pen 's surprise , at the swallow - tails of the Captain 's dress - coat ; for the truth is , that the good - natured gentleman , when he was in cash , generally brought home an apple or a piece of gingerbread for these children . "
27552	27658	27540	27542	Whereby the widdy	861	" as he remarked afterwards to Pen , winking knowingly , and laying a finger on his nose . Pen tumbled down the step , and as he followed his companion up the creaking old stair , his knees trembled under him . He could hardly see when he entered , following the Captain , and stood in the room - in her room . He saw something black before him , and waving as if making a curtsey , and heard , but quite indistinctly , Costigan making a speech over him , in which the Captain , with his usual magniloquence , expressed to "
27661	27669	27540	27542	Whereby the widdy	861	" his wish to make her known to "
27717	27718	27707	27715	a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart	2623	" "
27725	27743	27707	27715	a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart	2623	" Miss Fotheringay said , in an Irish accent , and with a deep rich melancholy voice . "
27746	28006	27707	27715	a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart	2623	" said Mr. Pendennis . In this romantic way their conversation began ; and he found himself seated on a chair , and having leisure to look at the young lady . She looked still handsomer off the stage , than before the lamps . All her attitudes were naturally grand and majestical . If she went and stood up against the mantelpiece her robe draped itself classically round her ; her chin supported itself on her hand , the other lines of her form arranged themselves in full harmonious undulations - she looked like a Muse in contemplation . If she sate down on a cane - bottomed chair , her arm rounded itself over the back of the seat , her hand seemed as if it ought to have a sceptre put into it , the folds of her dress fell naturally round her in order , like ladies of honour round a throne , and she looked like an empress . All her movements were graceful and imperial . In the morning you could see her hair was blue - black , her complexion of dazzling fairness , with the faintest possible blush flickering , as it were , in her cheek . Her eyes were grey , with prodigious long lashes ; and as for her mouth , Mr. Pendennis has given me subsequently to understand , that it was of a staring red colour , with which the most brilliant geranium , sealing - wax , or Guardsman 's coat , could not vie . "
28011	28072	27707	27715	a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart	2623	" continued this empress and Queen of Sheba . Mr. Pen again assented , and the conversation rolled on in this manner . She asked Costigan whether he had had a pleasant evening at the George , and he recounted the supper and the tumblers of punch . Then the father asked her how she had been employing the morning . "
28076	28080	28073	28073	Bows	833	" said she , "
28112	28113	28118	28118	you	0	" "
28121	28156	28118	28118	you	0	" Mr. Pendennis cried ; wondering that she should say ' Ophalia , ' and speak with an Irish inflection of voice naturally , who had not the least Hibernian accent on the stage . "
28168	28199	28200	28200	Mr	2627	" said the Captain , tapping his waistcoat pocket , wherein lay Pen 's sovereigns , and winking at Pen , with one eye , at which the boy blushed . "
28208	28213	28200	28200	Mr	2627	" said Mrs. Haller . "
28219	28225	28226	28226	I	0	" said Pen , blushing . "
28239	28259	28260	28260	Pendennis	685	" His heart thumped so as he made this audacious declaration , that he almost choked in uttering it . "
28261	28322	28323	28323	I	0	" - she answered slowly , and looking him full in the eyes , with a glance , so straight , so clear , so bright , so killing , with a voice so sweet , so round , so low , that the word and the glance shot Pen through and through , and perfectly transfixed him with pleasure . "
28333	28337	28323	28323	I	0	" Pen said . "
28345	28349	28350	28350	Pentweazle	866	" Ophelia said . "
28474	28475	28462	28462	he	870	" "
28483	28488	28480	28480	she	2637	" the Captain interposed ; "
28518	28519	28515	28516	Jack Costigan	692	" "
28529	28535	28520	28520	I	0	" Miss Fotheringay said modestly ; "
28546	28547	28542	28542	Bows	833	" "
28555	28568	28542	28542	Bows	833	" said the Captain : and bending to Pendennis , he added , "
28674	28675	28666	28666	ye	2261	" "
28684	28695	28678	28678	I	0	" Emily said , with perfect simplicity . She pronounced it "
28698	28699	28678	28678	I	0	" "
28714	28719	28708	28708	sir	2261	" said Costigan gallantly . "
28751	28845	28738	28738	I	0	" Pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six o'clock , but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point , and was only too eager to accept this invitation . He looked on with delight and wonder whilst Ophelia busied herself about the room , and prepared for the dinner . She arranged the glasses , and laid and smoothed the little cloth , all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour , which enchanted her guest more and more . The "
28847	29081	29146	29146	she	2655	" arrived from the baker 's in the hands of one of the little choir - boy 's brothers at the proper hour : and at four o'clock Pen found himself at dinner - actually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world , and her father - with the handsomest woman in all creation - with his first and only love , whom he had adored ever since when ? - ever since yesterday , ever since for ever . He ate a crust of her making , he poured her out a glass of beer , he saw her drink a glass of punch - just one wine - glass full - out of the tumbler which she mixed for her papa . She was perfectly good - natured , and offered to mix one for Pendennis too . It was prodigiously strong ; Pen had never in his life drunk so much spirits and water . Was it the punch , or the punch - maker who intoxicated him ? During dinner , when the Captain , whom his daughter treated most respectfully , ceased prattling about himself and his adventures , Pen tried to engage the Fotheringay in conversation about poetry and about her profession . He asked her what she thought of Ophelia 's madness , and whether she was in love with Hamlet or not ? "
29098	29124	29091	29096	that stunted manager of a Bingley	2653	" She bristled with indignation at the thought . Pen explained it was not of her he spoke , but of Ophelia of the play . "
29158	29166	29146	29146	she	2655	" Pen next tried her on Kotzebue . "
29173	29175	29171	29171	he	874	" - "
29190	29191	29192	29192	She	2655	" "
29211	29353	29209	29209	Thompson	875	" she said . Pen laughed at her adorable simplicity . He told her of the melancholy fate of the author of the play , and how Sand had killed him . It was for the first time in her life that Miss Costigan had ever heard of Mr. Kotzebue 's existence , but she looked as if she was very much interested , and her sympathy sufficed for honest Pen . And in the midst of this simple conversation , the hour and a quarter which poor Pen could afford to allow himself , passed away only too quickly ; and he had taken leave , he was gone , and away on his rapid road homewards on the back of Rebecca . She was called upon to show her mettle in the three journeys which she made that day . "
29379	29386	29357	29357	he	2658	" Emily asked of her father . "
29398	29403	29395	29395	Milly	677	" answered the Captain . "
29412	29413	29404	29404	We	2661	" "
29428	29433	29416	29416	he	2658	" the lady said : "
29443	29444	29438	29438	he	2658	" "
29461	29466	29459	29459	Milly	677	" the Captain said . "
29479	29480	29481	29481	He	2658	" "
29489	29494	29481	29481	He	2658	" Miss Fotheringay continued . "
29538	29539	29534	29534	papa	2629	" "
29547	29558	29534	29534	papa	2629	" ejaculated the Captain , and changed the painful theme . "
29569	29576	29564	29566	the young gentleman	14242	" Costigan went on to say ; "
29591	29592	29593	29593	He	2658	" "
29611	29631	29607	29607	I	0	" cried the daughter , a prudent lass , who always kept her fine eyes on the main chance . "
29639	29725	29632	29632	I	0	" answered the papa , and so their conversation continued awhile , until the tumbler of punch was finished ; and their hour of departure soon came , too ; for at half - past six Miss Fotheringay was to appear at the theatre again , whither her father always accompanied her ; and stood , as we have seen , in the side - scene watching her , and drank spirits - and - water in the green - room with the company there . "
29731	29738	29728	29728	she	2670	" thought Pen , cantering homewards . "
29980	30505	29977	29977	she	2679	" Now the reader , who has had the benefit of overhearing the entire conversation which Pen had with Miss Fotheringay , can judge for himself about the powers of her mind , and may perhaps be disposed to think that she has not said anything astonishingly humorous or intellectual in the course of the above interview . She has married , and taken her position in the world as the most spotless and irreproachable lady since , and I have had the pleasure of making her acquaintance : and must certainly own , against my friend Pen 's opinion , that his adored Emily is not a clever woman . The truth is , she had not only never heard of Kotzebue , but she had never heard of Farquhar , or Congreve , or any dramatist in whose plays she had not a part : and of these dramas she only knew the part which concerned herself . A wag once told her that Dante was born at Algiers : and asked her , - which Dr. Johnson wrote first , ' Irene , ' or ' Every Man in his Humour . ' But she had the best of the joke , for she had never heard of Irene or Every Man in his Humour , or Dante , or perhaps Algiers . It was all one to her . She acted what little Bows told her - where he told her to sob , she sobbed - where he told her to laugh , she laughed . She gave the tirade or the repartee without the slightest notion of its meaning . She went to church and goes every Sunday , with a reputation perfectly intact , and was and is as guiltless of sense as of any other crime . But what did our Pen know of these things ? He saw a pair of bright eyes , and he believed in them - a beautiful image , and he fell down and worshipped it . He supplied the meaning which her words wanted ; and created the divinity which he loved . Was Titania the first who fell in love with an ass , or Pygmalion the only artist who has gone crazy about a stone ? He had found her ; he had found what his soul thirsted after . He flung himself into the stream and drank with all his might . Let those say who have been thirsty once how delicious that first draught is . As he rode down the avenue towards home - Pen shrieked with laughter as he saw the Reverend Mr. Smirke once more coming demurely away from Fairoaks on his pony . Smirke had dawdled and stayed at the cottages on the way , and then dawdled with Laura over her lessons - and then looked at Mrs. Pendennis 's gardens and improvements until he had perfectly bored out that lady : and he had taken his leave at the very last minute without that invitation to dinner which he fondly expected . Pen was full of kindness and triumph . "
30513	30519	29977	29977	she	2679	" he cried out laughing . "
30554	30667	30552	30552	Smirke	759	" Poor Smirke turned the pony 's head round , and jogged along with Arthur . His mother was charmed to see him in such high spirits , and welcomed Mr. Smirke for his sake , when Arthur said he had forced the curate back to dine . He gave a most ludicrous account of the play of the night before , and of the acting of Bingley the Manager , in his rickety Hessians , and the enormous Mrs. Bingley as the Countess , in rumpled green satin and a Polish cap ; he mimicked them , and delighted his mother and little Laura , who clapped her hands with pleasure . "
30672	30677	30669	30670	Mrs. Haller	819	" said Mrs. Pendennis . "
30685	30703	30680	30681	a stunner	14785	" Pen said , laughing , and using the words of his revered friend , Mr. Foker . "
30709	30714	30707	30707	Arthur	697	" asked the lady . "
30722	30840	30720	30720	Arthur	697	" cried Laura , in the same voice . So he gave them a queer account of Mr. Foker , and how he used to be called Vats and Grains , and by other contumelious names at school : and how he was now exceedingly rich , and a Fellow Commoner at St. Boniface . But gay and communicative as he was , Mr. Pen did not say one syllable about his ride to Chatteris that day , or about the new friends whom he had made there . When the two ladies retired , Pen , with flashing eyes , filled up two great bumpers of Madeira , and looking Smirke full in the face said , "
30846	30847	30720	30720	Arthur	697	" "
30853	30932	30720	30720	Arthur	697	" said the curate with a sigh , lifting the glass and emptying it , so that his face was a little pink when he put it down . Pen had even less sleep that night than on the night before . In the morning , and almost before dawn , he went out and saddled that unfortunate Rebecca himself , and rode her on the Downs like mad . Again Love had roused him - and said , "
30941	31349	31351	31351	he	2687	" That charming fever - that delicious longing - and fire , and uncertainty ; he hugged them to him - be would not have lost them for all the world . CHAPTER VI Contains both Love and War Cicero and Euripides did not occupy Mr. Pen much for some time after this , and honest Mr. Smirke had a very easy time with his pupil . Rebecca was the animal who suffered most in the present state of Pen 's mind , for , besides those days when he could publicly announce his intention of going to Chatteris to take a fencing - lesson , and went thither with the knowledge of his mother , whenever he saw three hours clear before him , the young rascal made a rush for the city , and found his way to Prior 's Lane . He was as frantic with vexation when Rebecca went lame , as Richard at Bosworth , when his horse was killed under him : and got deeply into the books of the man who kept the hunting - stables at Chatteris for the doctoring of his own , and the hire of another animal . Then , and perhaps once in a week , under pretence of going to read a Greek play with Smirke , this young reprobate set off so as to be in time for the Competitor down coach , stayed a couple of hours in Chatteris , and returned on the Rival which left for London at ten at night . Once his secret was nearly lost by Smirke 's simplicity , of whom Mrs. Pendennis asked whether they had read a great deal the night before , or a question to that effect . Smirke was about to tell the truth , that he had never seen Mr. Pen at all , when the latter 's boot - heel came grinding down on Mr. Smirke 's toe under the table , and warned the curate not to betray him . They had had conversations on the tender subject , of course . It is good sport if you are not yourself engaged in the conversation to hear two men in love talk . There must be a confidant and depositary somewhere . When informed , under the most solemn vows of secrecy , of Pen 's condition of mind , the curate said , with no small tremor , "
31367	31425	31426	31426	Unlawful	887	" - for if so , the poor fellow felt it would be his duty to break his vow and inform Pen 's mother , and then there would be a quarrel , he felt , with sickening apprehension , and he would never again have a chance of seeing what he most liked in the world . "
31430	31440	31426	31426	Unlawful	887	" Pen bounced out at the curate 's question . "
31518	31529	31512	31512	I	0	" Smirke , with a faint laugh , only said , "
31550	31715	31545	31545	I	0	" but by this compromise the wretched curate was put more than ever into the power of his pupil , and the Greek and mathematics suffered correspondingly . If the reverend gentleman had had much discernment , and looked into the Poet 's Corner of the County Chronicle , as it arrived in the Wednesday 's bag , he might have seen ' Mrs. Haller , ' ' Passion and Genius , ' ' Lines to Miss Fotheringay , of the Theatre Royal , ' appearing every week ; and other verses of the most gloomy , thrilling , and passionate cast . But as these poems were no longer signed NEP by their artful composer , but subscribed EROS , neither the tutor nor Helen , the good soul , who cut all her son 's verses out of the paper , knew that Nep was no other than that flaming Eros , who sang so vehemently the character of the new actress . "
31721	31728	31718	31719	the lady	14974	" at last asked Mrs. Pendennis , "
31762	31777	31759	31760	Miss Fotheringay	677	" Pen said yes , he had ; that night he went to see the "
31780	31842	31759	31760	Miss Fotheringay	677	" she acted Mrs. Haller . By the way , she was going to have a benefit , and was to appear in Ophelia - suppose we were to go - Shakspeare , you know , mother - we can get horses from the Clavering Arms . Little Laura sprang up with delight , she longed for a play . Pen introduced "
31848	32491	31843	31843	Shakspeare	767	" because the deceased Pendennis , as became a man of his character , professed an uncommon respect for the bard of Avon , in whose works he safely said there was more poetry than in all ' Johnson 's Poets ' put together . And though Mr. Pendennis did not much read the works in question , yet he enjoined Pen to peruse them , and often said what pleasure he should have , when the boy was of a proper age , in taking him and mother to see some good plays of the immortal poet . The ready tears welled up in the kind mother 's eyes as she remembered these speeches of the man who was gone . She kissed her son fondly , and said she would go . Laura jumped for joy . Was Pen happy ? - was he ashamed ? As he held his mother to him , he longed to tell her all , but he kept his counsel . He would see how his mother liked her ; the play should be the thing , and he would try his mother like Hamlet 's . Helen , in her good humour , asked Mr. Smirke to be of the party . That ecclesiastic had been bred up by a fond parent at Clapham , who had an objection to dramatic entertainments , and he had never yet seen a play . But , Shakspeare ! - but to go with Mrs. Pendennis in her carriage , and sit a whole night by her side ! - he could not resist the idea of so much pleasure , and made a feeble speech , in which he spoke of temptation and gratitude , and finally accepted Mrs. Pendennis 's most kind offer . As he spoke he gave her a look , which made her exceedingly uncomfortable . She had seen that look more than once , of late , pursuing her . He became more positively odious every day in the widow 's eyes . We are not going to say a great deal about Pen 's courtship of Miss Fotheringay , for the reader has already had a specimen of her conversation , much of which need surely not be reported . Pen sate with her hour after hour , and poured forth all his honest boyish soul to her . Everything he knew , or hoped , or felt , or had read , or fancied , he told to her . He never tired of talking and longing . One after another , as his thoughts rose in his hot eager brain , he clothed them in words , and told them to her . Her part of the tete - a - tete was not to talk , but to appear as if she understood what Pen talked a difficult matter , for the young fellow blurted out no small quantity of nonsense , and to look exceedingly handsome and sympathising . The fact is , whilst he was making one of his tirades - and delighted , perhaps , and wondering at his own eloquence , the lad would go on for twenty minutes at a time - the lovely Emily , who could not comprehend a tenth part of his talk , had leisure to think about her own affairs , and would arrange in her own mind how they should dress the cold mutton , or how she would turn the black satin , or make herself out of her scarf a bonnet like Miss Thackthwaite 's new one , and so forth . Pen spouted Byron and Moore ; passion and poetry : her business was to throw up her eyes , or fixing them for a moment on his face , to cry , "
32508	32589	32597	32597	ye've	2696	" And off the boy went , and she returned to her own simple thoughts about the turned gown , or the hashed mutton . In fact Pen 's passion was not long a secret from the lovely Emily or her father . Upon his second visit , his admiration was quite evident to both of them , and on his departure the old gentleman said to his daughter , as he winked at her over his glass of grog , "
32602	32603	32595	32595	I	0	" "
32615	32619	32612	32613	papa dear	2699	" Milly remarked . "
32627	32659	32624	32625	a child	14419	" Pen would have been very much pleased if he had heard that phrase - he was galloping home wild with pleasure , and shouting out her name as he rode . "
32667	32672	32660	32660	Ye've	2696	" said the Captain , "
32744	32745	32746	32747	Them boys	2704	" "
32752	32758	32759	32759	Ye	2696	" said Milly , seriously . "
32804	32805	32796	32797	his mother	13927	" "
32862	32863	32867	32867	his	692	" "
32879	32883	32872	32872	you	2629	" Milly said . "
32924	33963	32921	32922	Captain Costigan	847	" So Pen used to come day after day , rushing in and galloping away , and growing more wild about the girl with every visit . Sometimes the Captain was present at their meetings ; but having a perfect confidence in his daughter , he was more often inclined to leave the young couple to themselves , and cocked his hat over his eye , and strutted off on some errand when Pen entered . How delightful those interviews were ! The Captain 's drawing - room was a low wainscoted room , with a large window looking into the Dean 's garden . There Pen sate and talked - and talked - Emily , looking beautiful as she sate at her work - looking beautiful and calm , and the sunshine came streaming in at the great windows , and lighted up her superb face and form . In the midst of the conversation , the great bell would begin to boom , and he would pause smiling , and be silent until the sound of the vast music died away - or the rooks in the cathedral elms would make a great noise towards sunset - or the sound of the organ and the choristers would come over the quiet air , and gently hush Pen 's talking . By the way , it must be said that Miss Fotheringay , in a plain shawl and a close bonnet and veil , went to church every Sunday of her life , accompanied by her indefatigable father , who gave the responses in a very rich and fine brogue , joined in the psalms and chanting , and behaved in the most exemplary manner . Little Bows , the house - friend of the family , was exceedingly wroth at the notion of Miss Fotheringay 's marriage with a stripling seven or eight years her junior . Bows , who was a cripple , and owned that he was a little more deformed even than Bingley the manager , so that he could not appear on the stage , was a singular wild man of no small talents and humour . Attracted first by Miss Fotheringay 's beauty , he began to teach her how to act . He shrieked out in his cracked voice the parts , and his pupil learned them from his lips by rote , and repeated them in her full rich tones . He indicated the attitudes , and set and moved those beautiful arms of hers . Those who remember this grand actress on the stage can recall how she used always precisely the same gestures , looks , and tones ; how she stood on the same plank of the stage in the same position , rolled her eyes at the same instant and to the same degree , and wept with precisely the same heart - rending pathos and over the same pathetic syllable . And after she had come out trembling with emotion before the audience , and looking so exhausted and tearful that you fancied she would faint with sensibility , she would gather up her hair the instant she was behind the curtain , and go home to a mutton - chop and a glass of brown stout ; and the harrowing labours of the day over , she went to bed and snored as resolutely and as regularly as a porter . Bows then was indignant at the notion that his pupil should throw her chances away in life by bestowing her hand upon a little country squire . As soon as a London manager saw her he prophesied that she would get a London engagement , and a great success . The misfortune was that the London managers had seen her . She had played in London three years before , and failed from utter stupidity . Since then it was that Bows had taken her in hand and taught her part after part . How he worked and screamed , and twisted , and repeated lines over and over again , and with what indomitable patience and dulness she followed him ! She knew that he made her : and let herself be made . She was not grateful , or ungrateful , or unkind , or ill - humoured . She was only stupid ; and Pen was madly in love with her . The post - horses from the Clavering Arms arrived in due time , and carried the party to the theatre at Chatteris , where Pen was gratified in perceiving that a tolerably large audience was assembled . The young gentlemen from Baymouth had a box , in the front of which sate Mr. Foker and his friend Mr. Spavin , splendidly attired in the most full - blown evening costume . They saluted Pen in a cordial manner , and examined his party , of which they approved , for little Laura was a pretty little red - cheeked girl with a quantity of shining brown ringlets , and Mrs. Pendennis , dressed in black velvet with the diamond cross which she sported on great occasions , looked uncommonly handsome and majestic . Behind these sate Mr. Arthur , and the gentle Smirke with the curl reposing on his fair forehead , and his white tie in perfect order . He blushed to find himself in such a place - but how happy was he to be there ! He and Mrs. Pendennis brought books of ' Hamlet ' with them to follow the tragedy , as is the custom of honest countryfolks who go to a play in state . Samuel , coachman , groom , and gardener to Mr. Pendennis , took his place in the pit , where Mr. Foker 's man was also visible . It was dotted with non - commissioned officers of the Dragoons , whose band , by kind permission of Colonel Swallowtail , were , as usual , in the orchestra ; and that corpulent and distinguished warrior himself , with his Waterloo medal and a number of his young men , made a handsome show in the boxes . "
33977	33991	33992	33992	His	2716	" Mrs. Pendennis asked of her son . Pen blushed a great deal . "
34000	34004	34005	34007	a Peninsular officer	2718	" he said - "
34009	34397	34005	34007	a Peninsular officer	2718	" In fact it was the Captain in a new shoot of clothes , as he called them , and with a large pair of white kid gloves , one of which he waved to Pendennis , whilst he laid the other sprawling over his heart and coat - buttons . Pen did not say any more . And how was Mrs. Pendennis to know that Mr. Costigan was the father of Miss Fotheringay ? Mr. Hornbull , from London , was the Hamlet of the night , Mr. Bingley modestly contenting himself with the part of Horatio , and reserving his chief strength for William in ' Black - Eyed Susan , ' which was the second piece . We have nothing to do with the play : except to say that Ophelia looked lovely , and performed with admirable wild pathos laughing , weeping , gazing wildly , waving her beautiful white arms , and flinging about her snatches of flowers and songs with the most charming madness . What an opportunity her splendid black hair had of tossing over her shoulders ! She made the most charming corpse ever seen ; and while Hamlet and Laertes were battling in her grave , she was looking out from the back scenes with some curiosity towards Pen 's box , and the family party assembled in it . There was but one voice in her praise there . Mrs. Pendennis was in ecstasies with her beauty . Little Laura was bewildered by the piece , and the Ghost , and the play within the play during which , as Hamlet lay at Ophelia 's knee , Pen felt that he would have liked to strangle Mr. Hornbull , but cried out great praises of that beautiful young creature . Pen was charmed with the effect which she produced on his mother - and the clergyman , for his part , was exceedingly enthusiastic . When the curtain fell upon that group of slaughtered personages , who are despatched so suddenly at the end of ' Hamlet , ' and whose demise astonished poor little Laura not a little , there was an immense shouting and applause from all quarters of the house ; the intrepid Smirke , violently excited , clapped his hands , and cried out "
34402	34482	34400	34400	Bravo	901	" as loud as the Dragoon officers themselves . These were greatly moved , - ils s'agitaient sur leurs bancs , - to borrow a phrase from our neighbours . They were led cheering into action by the portly Swallowtail , who waved his cap - the non - commissioned officers in the pit , of course , gallantly following their chiefs . There was a roar of bravos rang through the house ; Pen bellowing with the loudest , "
34487	34604	34400	34400	Bravo	901	" and Messrs. Spavin and Foker giving the view - halloo from their box . Even Mrs. Pendennis began to wave about her pocket - handkerchief , and little Laura danced , laughed , clapped , and looked up at Pen with wonder . Hornbull led the beneficiaire forward , amidst bursts of enthusiasm - and she looked so handsome and radiant , with her hair still over her shoulders , that Pen hardly could contain himself for rapture : and he leaned over his mother 's chair , and shouted , and hurrayed , and waved his hat . It was all he could do to keep his secret from Helen , and not say , "
34624	34895	34617	34617	I	0	" But he disguised these feelings under an enormous bellowing and hurraying . As for Miss Fotheringay and her behaviour , the reader is referred to a former page for an account of that . She went through precisely the same business . She surveyed the house all round with glances of gratitude ; and trembled , and almost sank with emotion , over her favourite trap - door . She seized the flowers Foker discharged a prodigious bouquet at her , and even Smirke made a feeble shy with a rose , and blushed dreadfully when it fell into the pit . She seized the flowers and pressed them to her swelling heart - etc . , etc . - in a word - we refer the reader to earlier pages . Twinkling in her breast poor old Pen saw a locket which he had bought of Mr. Nathan in High Street , with the last shilling he was worth , and a sovereign borrowed from Smirke . ' Black - Eyed Susan ' followed , at which sweet story our gentle - hearted friends were exceedingly charmed and affected : and in which Susan , with a russet gown and a pink ribbon in her cap , looked to the full as lovely as Ophelia . Bingley was great in William . Goll , as the Admiral , looked like the figure - head of a seventy - four ; and Garbetts , as Captain Boldweather , a miscreant who forms a plan for carrying off Black - eyed Susan , and waving an immense cocked hat says , "
34907	35508	34900	34900	he	2721	" - all these performed their parts with their accustomed talent ; and it was with a sincere regret that all our friends saw the curtain drop down and end that pretty and tender story . If Pen had been alone with his mother in the carriage as they went home , he would have told her all , that night ; but he sate on the box in the moonshine smoking a cigar by the side of Smirke , who warmed himself with a comforter . Mr. Foker 's tandem and lamps whirled by the sober old Clavering posters as they were a couple of miles on their road home , and Mr. Spavin saluted Mrs. Pendennis 's carriage with some considerable variations of Rule Britannia on the key - bugle . It happened two days after the above gaieties that Mr. Dean of Chatteris entertained a few select clerical friends at dinner at his Deanery Home . That they drank uncommonly good port wine , and abused the Bishop over their dessert , are very likely matters : but with such we have nothing at present to do . Our friend Doctor Portman , of Clavering , was one of the Dean 's guests , and being a gallant man , and seeing from his place at the mahogany the Dean 's lady walking up and down the grass , with her children sporting around her , and her pink parasol over her lovely head - the Doctor stept out of the French windows of the dining - room into the lawn , which skirts that apartment , and left the other white neckcloths to gird at my lord Bishop . Then the Doctor went up and offered Mrs. Dean his arm , and they sauntered over the ancient velvet lawn , which had been mowed and rolled for immemorial Deans , in that easy , quiet , comfortable manner , in which people of middle age and good temper walk after a good dinner , in a calm golden summer evening , when the sun has but just sunk behind the enormous cathedral - towers , and the sickle - shaped moon is growing every instant brighter in the heavens . Now at the end of the Dean 's garden there is , as we have stated , Mrs. Creed 's house , and the windows of the first - floor room were open to admit the pleasant summer air . A young lady of six - and - twenty , whose eyes were perfectly wide open , and a luckless boy of eighteen , blind with love and infatuation , were in that chamber together ; in which persons , as we have before seen them in the same place , the reader will have no difficulty in recognising Mr. Arthur Pendennis and Miss Costigan . The poor boy had taken the plunge . Trembling with passionate emotion , his heart beating and throbbing fiercely , tears rushing forth in spite of him , his voice almost choking with feeling , poor Pen had said those words which he could withhold no more , and flung himself and his whole store of love , and admiration , and ardour at the feet of this mature beauty . Is he the first who has done so ? Have none before or after him staked all their treasure of life , as a savage does his land and possessions against a draught of the fair - skins ' fire - water , or a couple of bauble eyes ? "
35518	35543	35516	35516	Arthur	739	" said Miss Fotheringay , slowly . He seized her hand madly and kissed it a thousand times . She did not withdraw it . "
35551	35558	35545	35547	the old lady	14000	" Miss Costigan thought to herself , "
35565	35588	35562	35562	she	14000	" and then she remembered what a handsome diamond cross Mrs. Pendennis had on the night of the play , and thought , "
35597	35598	35562	35562	she	14000	" "
35605	35662	35600	35600	yourself	2723	" she said , in her low rich voice , and sniffled sweetly and gravely upon him . Then , with her disengaged hand , she put the hair lightly off his throbbing forehead . He was in such a rapture and whirl of happiness that he could hardly speak . At last he gasped out , "
35696	35697	35688	35688	She	2288	" "
35707	35933	35934	35934	I	0	" said Miss Costigan , perhaps with a sort of pity for Pen . Think she did ! Of course here Mr. Pen went off into a rhapsody through which , as we have perfect command over our own feelings , we have no reason to follow the lad . Of course , love , truth , and eternity were produced : and words were tried but found impossible to plumb the tremendous depth of his affection . This speech , we say , is no business of ours . It was most likely not very wise , but what right have we to overhear ? Let the poor boy fling out his simple heart at the woman 's feet , and deal gently with him . It is best to love wisely , no doubt : but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all . Some of us ca n't : and are proud of our impotence too . At the end of his speech Pen again kissed the imperial hand with rapture - and I believe it was at this very moment , and while Mrs. Dean and Doctor Portman were engaged in conversation , that young Master Ridley Roset , her son , pulled his mother by the back of her capacious dress and said - "
35942	36081	36085	36085	somebody	14677	" - and he waggled his innocent head . That was , indeed , a view from the Dean 's garden such as seldom is seen by Deans - or is written in Chapters . There was poor Pen performing a salute upon the rosy fingers of his charmer , who received the embrace with perfect calmness and good humour . Master Ridley looked up and grinned , little Miss Rosa looked at her brother , and opened the mouth of astonishment . Mrs. Dean 's countenance defied expression , and as for Dr. Portman , when he beheld the scene , and saw his prime favourite and dear pupil Pen , he stood mute with rage and wonder . Mrs. Haller spied the party below at the same moment , and gave a start and a laugh . "
36092	36349	36085	36085	somebody	14677	" she cried out ; and withdrew with perfect calmness , whilst Pen darted away with his face glowing like coals . The garden party had re - entered the house when he ventured to look out again . The sickle moon was blazing bright in the heavens then , the stars were glittering , the bell of the cathedral tolling nine , the Dean 's guests all save one , who had called for his horse Dumpling , and ridden off early were partaking of tea and buttered cakes in Mrs. Dean 's drawing - room - when Pen took leave of Miss Costigan . Pen arrived at home in due time afterwards , and was going to slip off to bed , for the poor lad was greatly worn and agitated , and his high - strung nerves had been at almost a maddening pitch when a summons came to him by John the old footman , whose countenance bore a very ominous look , that his mother must see him below . On this he tied on his neckcloth again , and went downstairs to the drawing - room . There sate not only his mother , but her friend , the Reverend Doctor Portman . Helen 's face looked very pale by the light of the lamp - the Doctor 's was flushed , on the contrary , and quivering with anger and emotion . Pen saw at once that there was a crisis , and that there had been a discovery . "
36354	36358	36085	36085	somebody	14677	" he thought . "
36366	36374	36364	36364	Arthur	697	" Helen said in a trembling voice . "
36395	36411	36377	36377	you	2731	" bounced out the Doctor , in spite of Helen 's pale , appealing looks . "
36463	36464	36465	36465	Sir	2261	" "
36467	36471	36465	36465	Sir	2261	" said Pen . "
36479	36484	36465	36465	Sir	2261	" roared the Doctor . "
36525	36526	36515	36515	you	2261	" "
36529	36548	36549	36549	I	0	" Pen said , clapping his fist on the table , till the lamp flickered up and shook , "
36577	36578	36579	36579	Lady	2753	" "
36583	36588	36579	36579	Lady	2753	" cried the Doctor , "
36615	36616	36597	36597	you	2261	" "
36622	36627	36597	36597	you	2261	" shouted out Pen . "
36688	36689	36678	36678	you	2261	" "
36699	36709	36710	36710	I	0	" cried out Helen in an excess of joy . "
36728	36767	36719	36719	he	2168	" and the tender creature coming trembling forward flung herself on Pen 's shoulder . Pen felt himself a man , and a match for all the Doctors in Doctordom . He was glad this explanation had come . "
36775	36797	36768	36768	You	2763	" he said to his mother , with a soothing , protecting air , like Hamlet with Gertrude in the play . "
36857	36858	36849	36849	She	2763	" "
36863	36876	36859	36861	Drunken old reprobate	2767	" growled the Doctor , but Pen did not hear or heed . "
36912	37022	36910	36910	I	0	" - with a savage look at the Doctor - ' spurn the slanderer who dared to do her wrong . Her father was an officer , and distinguished himself in Spain . He was a friend of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent , and is intimately known to the Duke of Wellington , and some of the first officers of our army . He has met my uncle Arthur at Lord Hill 's , he thinks . His own family is one of the most ancient and respectable in Ireland , and indeed is as good as our own . The Costigans were kings of Ireland . "
37023	37031	37034	37035	the Doctor	13989	" Why , God bless my soul , "
37047	37060	37061	37061	Pen	799	" you do n't mean to say you want to marry her ? "
37069	37076	37077	37077	he	799	" What else , Dr. Portman , "
37080	37089	37077	37077	he	799	" do you suppose would be my desire ? "
37114	37125	37107	37108	the Doctor	13989	" Mrs. Pendennis , ma'am , send for the Major . "
37126	37137	37139	37142	Arthur Prince of Pendennis	910	" Send for the Major ? with all my heart , "
38185	38191	38192	38192	she	2823	" Come in , Pen , "
38195	38206	38192	38192	she	2823	" there 's somebody come ; uncle Arthur 's come . "
38207	38214	38216	38216	Pen	799	" He is , is he ? "
38266	38272	38273	38273	Pen	799	" Lead on , Laura , "
38285	38297	38273	38273	Pen	799	" Lead on , and say I wait upon my uncle . "
40027	40030	40032	40033	the mother	2237	" Arthur , "
40060	40072	40073	40073	she	2237	" Why do n't you go to sleep , my dear ? "
40105	40111	40112	40112	he	799	" I could n't sleep , "
40115	40125	40112	40112	he	799	" I - I was - I was writing . "
40139	40151	40129	40129	he	799	" O mother ! I love her , I love her ! "
40249	40270	40233	40234	old Cos	852	" Put them up with th ' other letthers , Milly darling . Poldoody 's pomes was nothing to this . "
40363	40378	40379	40379	she	2925	" He has a very high spirit , and will not brook unkind words , "
40382	40443	40445	40446	the widow	13904	" Dr. Portman spoke to him rather roughly - and I must own unjustly , the other night - for my dearest boy 's honour is as high as any mother can desire - but Pen 's answer quite frightened me , it was so indignant . Recollect he is a man now ; and be very - very cautious , "
40487	40491	40493	40495	the old negotiator	2929	" Bon Dieu ! "
40497	40547	40493	40495	the old negotiator	2929	" the boy has actually talked the woman round , and she 'd get him a wife as she would a toy if Master cried for it . Why are there no such things as lettres - de - cachet - and a Bastille for young fellows of family ? "
40606	40609	40611	40611	he	661	" Confess , "
40613	40639	40611	40611	he	661	" now , that you are thinking how you possibly can make it up to your conscience to let the boy have his own way . "
40652	40668	40650	40650	females	2933	" I am thinking that he is very unhappy - and I am too - - "
40669	40682	40684	40685	the other	14365	" To contradict him or to let him have his own wish ? "
40698	40709	40684	40685	the other	14365	" I 'm d - - d if he shall . "
40710	40727	40728	40729	the widow	13904	" To think that he should have formed so foolish and cruel and fatal an attachment , "
40732	40744	40728	40729	the widow	13904	" which can but end in pain whatever be the issue . "
40745	40757	40758	40759	the Major	2155	" The issue sha n't be marriage , my dear sister , "
40763	40801	40758	40759	the Major	2155	" We 're not going to have a Pendennis , the head of the house , marry a strolling mountebank from a booth . No , no , we wo n't marry into Greenwich Fair , ma'am . "
40802	40811	40812	40813	the widow	13904	" If the match is broken suddenly off , "
40816	40872	40812	40813	the widow	13904	" I do n't know what may be the consequence . I know Arthur 's ardent temper , the intensity of his affections , the agony of his pleasures and disappointments , and I tremble at this one if it must be . Indeed , indeed , it must not come on him too suddenly . "
40873	40878	40879	40880	the Major	2155	" My dear madam , "
40890	40926	40879	40880	the Major	2155	" I 've no doubt Arthur will have to suffer confoundedly before he gets over the little disappointment . But is he , think you , the only person who has been so rendered miserable ? "
40927	40932	40934	40934	Helen	673	" No , indeed , "
40961	40966	40968	40973	her brother - in - law	2939	" I , myself , "
40975	41147	40968	40973	her brother - in - law	2939	" have undergone a disappointment in early life . A young woman with fifteen thousand pounds , niece to an Earl - most accomplished creature - a third of her money would have run up my promotion in no time , and I should have been a lieutenant - colonel at thirty : but it might not be . I was but a penniless lieutenant : her parents interfered : and I embarked for India , where I had the honour of being secretary to Lord Buckley , when commander - in - Chief without her . What happened ? We returned our letters , sent back our locks of hair the Major here passed his fingers through his wig , we suffered - but we recovered . She is now a baronet 's wife with thirteen grown - up children ; altered , it is true , in person ; but her daughters remind me of what she was , and the third is to be presented early next week . "
41202	41213	41214	41215	the Major	2155	" Look at my own brother , my dear creature , "
41219	41306	41312	41312	he	2155	" he himself , you know , had a little disappointment when he started in the - the medical profession - an eligible opportunity presented itself . Miss Balls , I remember the name , was daughter of an apoth - a practitioner in very large practice ; my brother had very nearly succeeded in his suit . - But difficulties arose : disappointments supervened , and - and I am sure he had no reason to regret the disappointment , which gave him this hand , "
41321	41333	41335	41335	Helen	673	" Those marriages between people of such different rank and age , "
41337	41369	41371	41371	she	673	" are sad things . I have known them produce a great deal of unhappiness . - Laura 's father , my cousin , who - who was brought up with me "
41379	41386	41371	41371	she	673	" was an instance of that . "
41387	41391	41394	41395	the Major	2155	" Most injudicious , "
41397	41636	41371	41371	she	673	" I do n't know anything more painful than for a man to marry his superior in age or his inferior in station . Fancy marrying a woman of low rank of life , and having your house filled with her confounded tag - rag - and - bobtail of relations ! Fancy your wife attached to a mother who dropped her h 's , or called Maria Marire ! How are you to introduce her into society ? My dear Mrs. Pendennis , I will name no names , but in the very best circles of London society I have seen men suffering the most excruciating agony , I have known them to be cut , to be lost utterly , from the vulgarity of their wives ' connections . What did Lady Snapperton do last year at her dejeune dansant after the Bohemian Ball ? She told Lord Brouncker that he might bring his daughters or send them with a proper chaperon , but that she would not receive Lady Brouncker who was a druggist 's daughter , or some such thing , and as Tom Wagg remarked of her , never wanted medicine certainly , for she never had an h in her life . Good Ged , what would have been the trifling pang of a separation in the first instance to the enduring infliction of a constant misalliance and intercourse with low people ? "
41637	41642	41644	41644	Helen	673	" What , indeed ! "
41678	41894	41671	41671	his	661	" Then this fatal woman is ten years older than that silly young scapegrace of an Arthur . What happens in such cases , my dear creature ? I do n't mind telling you , now we are alone that in the highest state of society , misery , undeviating misery , is the result . Look at Lord Clodworthy come into a room with his wife - why , good Ged , she looks like Clodworthy 's mother . What 's the case between Lord and Lady Willowbank , whose love match was notorious ? He has already cut her down twice when she has hanged herself out of jealousy for Mademoiselle de Sainte Cunegonde , the dancer ; and mark my words , good Ged , one day he 'll not cut the old woman down . No , my dear madam , you are not in the world , but I am : you are a little romantic and sentimental you know you are - women with those large beautiful eyes always are ; you must leave this matter to my experience . Marry this woman ! Marry at eighteen an actress of thirty - bah bah ! - I would as soon he sent into the kitchen and married the cook . "
41895	41904	41907	41907	Helen	673	" I know the evils of premature engagements , "
42430	42448	42427	42427	she	934	" Law , Bell , I 'm sure you are too young to think of such things ; "
42650	42667	42646	42647	the latter	14046	" God bless my soul , I had n't the least idea what was going on ; "
43586	43591	43576	43576	Helen	702	" My dear Cousin , "
43594	43599	43600	43600	She	702	" always truly yours . "
43804	43812	43814	43815	Mrs. Bell	937	" I was old , was I ? "
43819	43846	43814	43815	Mrs. Bell	937	" I was old , and her inferior , was I ? but I married you , Mr. Bell , and kept you from marrying her ? "
44350	44358	44342	44343	his adversary	3063	" Come on , I 'm ready . "
44477	44491	44461	44461	his	2155	" Well , Pen , my boy , tell us all about it . "
44560	44577	44578	44578	he	799	" I - I - I did n't know that you were come till just now , "
44581	44593	44578	44578	he	799	" is - is - town very full , I suppose ? "
44679	44688	44690	44692	the old guardian	3077	" What a couple of fools they are , "
44694	44724	44690	44692	the old guardian	3077	" If I had n't come down , she would have driven over in state to pay a visit and give her blessing to the young lady 's family . "
44725	44730	44732	44732	he	3077	" Come , come , "
44740	44764	44732	44732	he	3077	" let us have as little sentiment as possible , and , Pen , my good fellow , tell us the whole story . "
44777	44784	44786	44786	he	3077	" The story is , sir , "
44788	44911	44786	44786	he	3077	" as I have written it to you before . I have made the acquaintance of a most beautiful and most virtuous lady ; of a high family , although in reduced circumstances : I have found the woman in whom I know that the happiness of my life is centred ; I feel that I never , never can think about any woman but her . I am aware of the difference of our ages and other difficulties in my way . But my affection was so great that I felt I could surmount all these ; that we both could : and she has consented to unite her lot with mine , and to accept my heart and my fortune . "
44912	44921	44923	44924	the Major	2155	" How much is that , my boy ? "
44926	44948	44923	44924	the Major	2155	" Has anybody left you some money ? I do n't know that you are worth a shilling in the world . "
44949	44958	44961	44962	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" You know what I have is his , "
44964	44974	44961	44962	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" Good heavens , madam , hold your tongue ! "
44995	45002	45003	45003	he	3080	" No doubt , no doubt , "
45006	45048	45003	45003	he	3080	" You would sacrifice anything for him . Everybody knows that . But it is , after all then , your fortune which Pen is offering to the young lady ; and of which he wishes to take possession at eighteen . "
45049	45059	45060	45060	Pen	799	" I know my mother will give me anything , "
45067	45266	45060	45060	Pen	799	" Yes , my good fellow , but there is reason in all things . If your mother keeps the house , it is but fair that she should select her company . When you give her house over her head , and transfer her banker 's account to yourself for the benefit of Miss What - d'-you - call-'em - Miss Costigan - do n't you think you should at least have consulted my sister as one of the principal parties in the transaction ? I am speaking to you , you see , without the least anger or assumption of authority , such as the law and your father 's will give me over you for three years to come - but as one man of the world to another , - and I ask you , if you think that , because you can do what you like with your mother , therefore you have a right to do so ? As you are her dependent , would it not have been more generous to wait before you took this step , and at least to have paid her the courtesy to ask her leave ? "
45309	45319	45321	45321	Pen	799	" I did it in a moment of passion , "
45325	45339	45321	45321	Pen	799	" I was not aware what I was going to say or to do "
45348	45391	45392	45392	he	799	" But now it is said , and I stand to it . No ; I neither can nor will recall it . I 'll die rather than do so . And I - I do n't want to burthen my mother , "
45395	45424	45392	45392	he	799	" I 'll work for myself . I 'll go on the stage , and act with her . She - she says I should do well there . "
45425	45435	45436	45437	the Major	2155	" But will she take you on those terms ? "
45440	45494	45436	45437	the Major	2155	" Mind , I do not say that Miss Costigan is not the most disinterested of women : but , do n't you suppose now , fairly , that your position as a young gentleman of ancient birth and decent expectations forms a part of the cause why she finds your addresses welcome ? "
45495	45511	45513	45513	Pen	799	" I 'll die , I say , rather than forfeit my pledge to her , "
45522	45531	45513	45513	Pen	799	" Who asks you , my dear friend ? "
45537	45583	45513	45513	Pen	799	" No gentleman breaks his word , of course , when it has been given freely . But after all , you can wait . You owe something to your mother , something to your family - something to me as your father 's representative . "
45584	45590	45591	45591	Pen	799	" Oh , of course , "
45598	45618	45591	45591	Pen	799	" Well , as you have pledged your word to her , give us another , will you Arthur ? "
45619	45624	45625	45625	Arthur	697	" What is it ? "
45628	45651	45625	45625	Arthur	697	" That you will make no private marriage - that you wo n't be taking a trip to Scotland , you understand . "
45652	45667	45668	45668	Helen	673	" That would be a falsehood . Pen never told his mother a falsehood , "
45719	45734	45735	45735	he	799	" No , sir - on my word of honour , as a gentleman , "
45738	45749	45735	45735	he	799	" I will never marry without my mother 's consent ! "
45777	45788	45789	45790	the mother	2237	" He 's an angel - he 's an angel , "
45800	45810	45812	45817	her brother - in - law	2939	" He comes of a good stock , ma'am , "
45819	45828	45812	45817	her brother - in - law	2939	" of a good stock on both sides . "
45895	45900	45902	45902	he	2155	" My dear creature , "
45910	46075	45902	45902	he	2155	" I think it certainly as well that I came down , and I flatter myself that last botte was a successful one . I tell you how I came to think of it . Three years ago my kind friend Lady Ferrybridge sent for me in the greatest state of alarm about her son Gretna , whose affair you remember , and implored me to use my influence with the young gentleman , who was engaged in an affaire de coeur with a Scotch clergyman 's daughter , Miss MacToddy . I implored , I entreated gentle measures . But Lord Ferrybridge was furious , and tried the high hand . Gretna was sulky and silent , and his parents thought they had conquered . But what was the fact , my dear creature ? The young people had been married for three months before Lord Ferrybridge knew anything about it . And that was why I extracted the promise from Master Pen . "
46076	46084	46085	46086	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" Arthur would never have done so , "
46089	46100	46085	46086	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" He has n't , - that is one comfort , "
46245	46251	46252	46253	the Major	2155	" After all , Pen , "
46276	46788	46790	46791	the Major	2155	" you must bear in mind that you are throwing yourself away . Your mother may submit to your marriage as she would to anything else you desired , if you did but cry long enough for it : but be sure of this , that it can never please her . You take a young woman off the boards of a country theatre and prefer her , for such is the case , to one of the finest ladies in England . And your mother will submit to your choice , but you ca n't suppose that she will be happy under it . I have often fancied , entre nous , that my sister had it in her eye to make a marriage between you and that little ward of hers - Flora , Laura - what 's her name ? And I always determined to do my small endeavour to prevent any such match . The child has but two thousand pounds , I am given to understand . It is only with the utmost economy and care that my sister can provide for the decent maintenance of her house , and for your appearance and education as a gentleman ; and I do n't care to own to you that I had other and much higher views for you . With your name and birth , sir - with your talents , which I suppose are respectable , with the friends whom I have the honour to possess , I could have placed you in an excellent position - a remarkable position for a young man of such exceeding small means , and had hoped to see you , at least , try to restore the honours of our name . Your mother 's softness stopped one prospect , or you might have been a general , like our gallant ancestor who fought at Ramillies and Malplaquet . I had another plan in view : my excellent and kind friend , Lord Bagwig , who is very well disposed towards me , would , I have little doubt , have attached you to his mission at Pumpernickel , and you might have advanced in the diplomatic service . But , pardon me for recurring to the subject ; how is a man to serve a young gentleman of eighteen , who proposes to marry a lady of thirty , whom he has selected from a booth in a fair ? - well , not a fair , - a barn . That profession at once is closed to you . The public service is closed to you . Society is closed to you . You see , my good friend , to what you bring yourself . You may get on at the bar to be sure , where I am given to understand that gentlemen of merit occasionally marry out of their kitchens ; but in no other profession . Or you may come and live down here - down here , mon Dieu ! for ever "
46808	47045	47047	47048	the Major	2155	" where your mother will receive the Mrs. Arthur that is to be , with perfect kindness ; where the good people of the county wo n't visit you ; and where , by Gad , sir , I shall be shy of visiting you myself , for I 'm a plain - spoken man , and I own to you that I like to live with gentlemen for my companions ; where you will have to live , with rum - and - water - drinking gentlemen - farmers , and drag through your life the young husband of an old woman , who , if she does n't quarrel with your mother , will at least cost that lady her position in society , and drag her down into that dubious caste into which you must inevitably fall . It is no affair of mine , my good sir . I am not angry . Your downfall will not hurt me farther than that it will extinguish the hopes I had of seeing my family once more taking its place in the world . It is only your mother and yourself that will be ruined . And I pity you both from my soul . Pass the claret : it is some I sent to your poor father ; I remember I bought it at poor Lord Levant 's sale . But of course , "
47054	47133	47047	47048	the Major	2155	" having engaged yourself , you will do what becomes you as a man of honour , however fatal your promise may be . However , promise us on our side , my boy , what I set out by entreating you to grant , - that there shall be nothing clandestine , that you will pursue your studies , that you will only visit your interesting friend at proper intervals . Do you write to her much ? "
47139	47148	47134	47134	Pen	799	" Why , yes , he had written . "
47149	47279	47280	47280	Pen	799	" I suppose verses , eh ! as well as prose ? I was a dab at verses myself . I recollect when I first joined , I used to write verses for the fellows in the regiment ; and did some pretty things in that way . I was talking to my old friend General Hobbler about some lines I dashed off for him in the year 1806 , when we were at the Cape , and , Gad , he remembered every line of them still ; for he 'd used 'em so often , the old rogue , and had actually tried 'em on Mrs. Hobbler , sir - who brought him sixty thousand pounds . I suppose you 've tried verses , eh , Pen ? "
47287	47297	47280	47280	Pen	799	" Why , yes , he had written verses . "
47298	47310	47312	47313	the Major	2155	" And does the fair one respond in poetry or prose ? "
47329	47343	47344	47344	Pen	799	" O Moses and Green Spectacles ! what a fool the boy is . "
47390	47401	47403	47405	the old campaigner	3110	" You have got the letters there , I see , "
47426	47440	47403	47405	the old campaigner	3110	" You know you have . I would give twopence to see 'em . "
47441	47444	47446	47446	Pen	799	" Why , "
47455	47460	47446	47446	Pen	799	" I - I , "
47554	47559	47561	47562	the Major	2155	" You sly rascal ! "
48712	48717	48718	48718	he	661	" My dear boy , "
48729	48999	48718	48718	he	661	" you can not begin your genealogical studies too early ; I wish to Heavens you would read in Debrett every day . Not so much the historical part for the pedigrees , between ourselves , are many of them very fabulous , and there are few families that can show such a clear descent as our own as the account of family alliances , and who is related to whom . I have known a man 's career in life blasted by ignorance on this important , this all - important subject . Why , only last month , at dinner at my Lord Hobanob 's , a young man , who has lately been received among us , young Mr. Suckling author of a work , I believe , began to speak lightly of Admiral Bowser 's conduct for ratting to Ministers , in what I must own is the most audacious manner . But who do you think sate next and opposite to this Mr. Suckling ? Why - why , next to him was Lady Grampound Bowser 's daughter , and opposite to him was Lord Grampound Bowser 's son - in - law . The infatuated young man went on cutting his jokes at the Admiral 's expense , fancying that all the world was laughing with him , and I leave you to imagine Lady Hobanob 's feelings - Hobanob 's ! - those of every well - bred man , as the wretched intru was so exposing himself . He will never dine again in South Street . I promise you that . "
49092	49097	49098	49099	the Major	2155	" He has daughters , "
49102	49141	49098	49099	the Major	2155	" Who knows ? you might have married Lady Emily or Lady Barbara Trehawk ; but all those dreams are over ; my poor fellow , you must lie on the bed which you have made for yourself . "
49399	49411	49412	49412	he	2155	" It do n't matter so much in town , Pen , "
49415	49595	49412	49412	he	2155	" for there the women go and the men are not missed . But when a gentleman is sur ses terres , he must give an example to the country people : and if I could turn a tune , I even think I should sing . The Duke of Saint David 's , whom I have the honour of knowing , always sings in the country , and let me tell you , it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew . And you are somebody down here . As long as the Claverings are away you are the first man in the parish : and as good as any . You might represent the town if you played your cards well . Your poor dear father would have done so had he lived ; so might you . - Not if you marry a lady , however amiable , whom the country people wo n't meet . - Well , well : it 's a painful subject . Let us change it , my boy . "
49745	49750	49737	49739	the pitiless guardian	3208	" Was she accomplished ? "
49759	49764	49767	49767	she	963	" Was she clever ? "
49785	49796	49781	49781	she	963	" Come , let us see some of her letters . "
49823	49829	49830	49831	the Major	2155	" She is cautious enough , "
49836	49847	49850	49850	he	2155	" She is older than you , my poor boy ; "
49999	50035	49989	49990	the Major	2155	" I suppose ye intend to leave me , now your grand relation has come down from town . He 'll carry ye off , and you 'll forget your poor Emily , Mr. Arthur ! "
50332	50339	50340	50340	he	739	" O , Emily , Emily , "
50351	50378	50345	50345	he	739	" you little know what sacrifices I am making for you ! - for you who are always so cold , so cautious , so mistrustful ; "
51368	51373	51374	51375	Mrs. Creed	860	" Whenever he come , "
51378	51505	51374	51375	Mrs. Creed	860	" She always have me or one of the children with her . And Mrs. Creed , marm , says she , if you please , marm , you 'll on no account leave the room when that young gentleman 's here . And many 's the time I 've seen him a lookin ' as if he wished I was away , poor young man : and he took to coming in service - time , when I was n't at home , of course : but she always had one of the boys up if her Pa was n't at home , or old Mr. Bowser with her a teaching of her her lesson , or one of the young ladies of the theayter . "
51568	51577	51578	51580	the excellent man	3324	" If it were but a temporary liaison , "
51583	51631	51578	51580	the excellent man	3324	" one could bear it . A young fellow must sow his wild oats , and that sort of thing . But a virtuous attachment is the deuce . It comes of the d - - d romantic notions boys get from being brought up by women . "
51632	51653	51655	51656	the Doctor	13989	" Allow me to say , Major , that you speak a little too like a man of the world , "
51658	51714	51655	51656	the Doctor	13989	" Nothing can be more desirable for Pen than a virtuous attachment for a young lady of his own rank and with a corresponding fortune - this present infatuation , of course , I must deplore as sincerely as you do . If I were his guardian I should command him to give it up . "
51715	51752	51753	51753	I	0	" The very means , I tell you , to make him marry to - morrow . We have got time from him , that is all , and we must do our best with that . "
51758	51777	51753	51753	I	0	" said the Doctor , at the end of the conversation in which the above subject was discussed - "
51803	51827	51794	51794	I	0	" The Major laughed - he had been a fortnight at Fairoaks , and strange to say , had not thought of that . "
51830	51834	51794	51794	I	0	" he said , "
51875	52070	51850	51851	the actress	3330	" So upon a day when it was arranged that Pen was to dine at home , and pass the evening with his mother , the two elderly gentlemen drove over to Chatteris in the Doctor 's chaise , and there , like a couple of jolly bachelors , dined at the George Inn , before proceeding to the play . Only two other guests were in the room , - an officer of the regiment quartered at Chatteris , and a young gentleman whom the Doctor thought he had somewhere seen . They left them at their meal , however , and hastened to the theatre . It was Hamlet over again . Shakspeare was Article XL . of stout old Doctor Portman 's creed , to which he always made a point of testifying publicly at least once in a year . We have described the play before , and how those who saw Miss Fotheringay perform in Ophelia saw precisely the same thing on one night as on another . Both the elderly gentlemen looked at her with extraordinary interest , thinking how very much young Pen was charmed with her . "
52073	52103	51850	51851	the actress	3330	" said the Major , between his teeth , as he surveyed her when she was called forward as usual , and swept her curtsies to the scanty audience , "
52114	52123	52104	52106	the young rascal	2238	" The Doctor applauded her loudly and loyally . "
52128	52132	52104	52106	the young rascal	2238	" said he , "
52156	52157	52145	52145	Major	3335	" "
52169	52372	52159	52161	that young officer	3336	" Major Pendennis answered , and he pointed out to Doctor Portman 's attention the young dragoon of the George Coffee - room , who sate in the box in question , and applauded with immense enthusiasm . She looked extremely sweet upon him too , thought the Major : but that 's their way - and he shut up his natty opera - glass and pocketed it , as if he wished to see no more that night . Nor did the Doctor , of course , propose to stay for the after - piece , so they rose and left the theatre ; the Doctor returning to Mrs. Portman , who was on a visit at the Deanery , and the Major walking home full of thought towards the George , where he had bespoken a bed . CHAPTER X Facing the Enemy Sauntering slowly homewards , Major Pendennis reached the George presently , and found Mr. Morgan , his faithful valet , awaiting him at the door of the George Inn , who stopped his master as he was about to take a candle to go to bed , and said , with his usual air of knowing deference , "
52401	52402	52390	52392	a young gentleman	2892	" "
52410	52419	52406	52407	Mr. Arthur	739	" the Major said , in great anger . "
52485	52596	52475	52475	you	2261	" the valet said , opening the coffee - room door . The Major entered ; and there indeed was Mr. Foker , the only occupant of the place . He was rubbing his eyes , and sate before a table rated with empty decanters and relics of dessert . He had intended to go to the play too , but sleep had overtaken him after a copious meal , and he had flung up his legs on the bench , and indulged in a nap instead of the dramatic amusement . The Major was meditating how to address the young man , but the latter prevented him that trouble . "
52607	52638	52605	52605	sir	2261	" said Mr. Foker , who was always communicative and affable ; and he took up the Globe from his table , and offered it to the new - comer . "
52647	52659	52639	52639	I	0	" said the Major , with a grateful bow and smile . "
52708	52709	52699	52699	you	2261	" "
52717	52722	52723	52723	I	0	" Mr. Foker said , "
52727	52735	52723	52723	I	0	" - he was going to say - "
52744	52751	52740	52742	a commercial gent	3354	" But he stopped that phrase . "
52761	52765	52740	52742	a commercial gent	3354	" he added . "
52834	52835	52822	52822	I	0	" "
52843	52852	52838	52838	you	2261	" said Mr. Foker , with much courtesy . "
52865	52866	52863	52863	you	2261	" "
52870	52875	52868	52868	guardian	13906	" added the Major . "
52888	52893	52886	52886	sir	2261	" said Mr. Foker . "
52901	52902	52897	52897	you	2261	" "
52939	52940	52941	52941	You	2261	" "
52951	52956	52941	52941	You	2261	" said the Major . "
52975	52976	52967	52967	he	739	" "
52985	52994	52967	52967	he	739	" Mr. Foker said , wagging his head - "
53015	53023	53024	53024	you	2261	" - the young gentleman broke out , "
53048	53073	53041	53041	he	739	" the candid young gentleman said . The Major found himself on the instant in the midst of a most interesting and confidential conversation . "
53081	53089	53090	53090	You	2261	" he asked , with a smile . "
53093	53143	53144	53144	You	2261	" Foker answered , winking at him - he would have winked at the Duke of Wellington with just as little scruple , for he was in that state of absence , candour , and fearlessness which a man sometimes possesses after drinking a couple of bottles of wine - "
53157	53158	53153	53153	women	14676	" "
53172	53177	53169	53170	Mr. Harry	801	" answered the Major . "
53191	53192	53169	53170	Mr. Harry	801	" "
53343	53362	53336	53336	he	739	" Foker said , slapping his hand on the table , until all the dessert began to jingle . "
53370	53375	53365	53365	you	0	" asked the Major . "
53446	53447	53448	53448	I	0	" "
53480	53481	53466	53466	he	976	" "
53496	53501	53482	53484	The young one	14759	" Mr. Foker said . "
53508	53519	53520	53521	another soupirant	3389	" the Major said , with great delight and anxiety , "
53523	53524	53520	53521	another soupirant	3389	" "
53528	53533	53520	53521	another soupirant	3389	" inquired Mr. Foker . "
53540	53541	53534	53538	Another admirer of Miss Fotheringay	3390	" "
53608	53609	53610	53610	I	0	" "
53629	53642	53643	53643	Foker	801	" Pretty well , thank you , sir - how are you ? "
53648	53686	53643	53643	Foker	801	" I 'm not clever , p'raps : but I am rather downy ; and partial friends say I know what 's o'clock tolerably well . Can I tell you the time of day in any way ? "
53687	53692	53693	53694	the Major	2155	" Upon my word , "
53700	53756	53693	53694	the Major	2155	" I think you may be of very great service to me . You are a young man of the world , and with such one likes to deal . And as such I need not inform you that our family is by no means delighted at this absurd intrigue in which Arthur is engaged . "
53757	53764	53766	53767	Mr. Foker	801	" I should rather think not , "
53769	53795	53766	53767	Mr. Foker	801	" Connexion not eligible . Too much beer drunk on the premises . No Irish need apply . That I take to be your meaning . "
53879	53883	53885	53885	he	801	" You see , "
53887	54064	53885	53885	he	801	" I think the General is fond of the jovial bowl , and if I wanted to be very certain of my money , it is n't in his pocket I 'd invest it - but he has always kept a watchful eye on his daughter , and neither he nor she will stand anything but what 's honourable . Pen 's attentions to her are talked about in the whole Company , and I hear all about them from a young lady who used to be very intimate with her , and with whose family I sometimes take tea in a friendly way . Miss Rouncy says , Sir Derby Oaks has been hanging about Miss Fotheringay ever since his regiment has been down here ; but Pen has come in and cut him out lately , which has made the Baronet so mad , that he has been very near on the point of proposing too . Wish he would ; and you 'd see which of the two Miss Fotheringay would jump at . "
54065	54071	54072	54073	the Major	2155	" I thought as much , "
54076	54098	54072	54073	the Major	2155	" You give me a great deal of pleasure , Mr. Foker . I wish I could have seen you before . "
54099	54109	54111	54112	the other	14365	" Did n't like to put in my oar , "
54114	54175	54111	54112	the other	14365	" Do n't speak till I 'm asked , when , if there 's no objections , I speak pretty freely . Heard your man had been hankering about my servant - did n't know myself what was going on until Miss Fotheringay and Miss Rouncy had the row about the ostrich feathers , when Miss R. told me everything . "
54176	54190	54072	54073	the Major	2155	" Miss Rouncy , I gather , was the confidante of the other . "
54191	54226	54234	54235	the Major	2155	" Confidant ? I believe you . Why , she 's twice as clever a girl as Fotheringay , and literary and that , while Miss Foth ca n't do much more than read . "
54227	54232	54234	54235	the Major	2155	" She can write , "
54250	54260	54261	54261	he	801	" He , he ! Rouncy writes her letters , "
54264	54331	54261	54261	he	801	" every one of 'em ; and since they 've quarrelled , she do n't know how the deuce to get on . Miss Rouncy is an uncommon pretty hand , whereas the old one makes dreadful work of the writing and spelling when Bows ai n't by . Rouncy 's been settin ' her copies lately - she writes a beautiful hand , Rouncy does . "
54332	54341	54343	54344	the Major	2155	" I suppose you know it pretty well , "
54355	54372	54348	54349	Mr. Foker	801	" I would give a great deal to have a specimen of her hand - writing , "
54377	54387	54348	54349	Mr. Foker	801	" I dare say you could give me one . "
54388	54399	54400	54400	Foker	801	" No , no , that would be too bad , "
54403	54467	54400	54400	Foker	801	" Perhaps I ought n't to have said as much as I have . Miss F. 's writin ' ai n't so very bad , I dare say ; only she got Miss R. to write the first letter , and has gone on ever since . But you mark my word , that till they are friends again the letters will stop . "
54468	54477	54478	54479	the Major	2155	" I hope they will never be reconciled , "
54485	54553	54478	54479	the Major	2155	" and I ca n't tell you how delighted I am to have had the good fortune of making your acquaintance . You must feel , my dear sir , as a man of the world , how fatal to my nephew 's prospects in life is this step which he contemplates , and how eager we all must be to free him from this absurd engagement . "
54554	54562	54564	54565	Mr. Foker	801	" He has come out uncommon strong , "
54567	54604	54564	54565	Mr. Foker	801	" I have seen his verses ; Rouncy copied 'em . And I said to myself when I saw 'em , ' Catch me writin ' verses to a woman , - that 's all . ' "
54605	54680	54478	54479	the Major	2155	" He has made a fool of himself , as many a good fellow has before him . How can we make him see his folly , and cure it ? I am sure you will give us what aid you can in extricating a generous young man from such a pair of schemers as this father and daughter seem to be . Love on the lady 's side is out of the question . "
54681	54686	54687	54687	Foker	801	" Love , indeed ! "
54690	54706	54687	54687	Foker	801	" If Pen had n't two thousand a year when he came of age - - "
54707	54714	54717	54718	the Major	2155	" If Pen had n't what ? "
54722	54744	54717	54718	the Major	2155	" Two thousand a year : has n't he got two thousand a year ? - the General says he has . "
54745	54750	54753	54754	the Major	2155	" My dear friend , "
54765	54822	54753	54754	the Major	2155	" thank you ! - thank you ! - I begin to see now . - Two thousand a year ! Why , his mother has but five hundred a year in the world . - She is likely to live to eighty , and Arthur has not a shilling but what she can allow him . "
54823	54832	54833	54833	Foker	801	" What ! he ai n't rich then ? "
54836	54849	54833	54833	Foker	801	" Upon my honour he has no more than what I say . "
54850	54861	54862	54863	The Major	2155	" And you ai n't going to leave him anything ? "
54894	54909	54910	54910	he	2155	" How much do you think a Major on half - pay can save ? "
54913	54945	54910	54910	he	2155	" If these people have been looking at him as a fortune , they are utterly mistaken - and - and you have made me the happiest man in the world . "
54946	54951	54953	54954	Mr. Foker	801	" Sir to you , "
55223	55232	55233	55233	he	13989	" I 'm going to fight the dragon , "
55244	55260	55262	55263	the Doctor	13989	" And I shrive you , sir , and bid good fortune go with you , "
55362	55367	55403	55404	The Major	2155	" Ha , ha ! "
55370	55381	55383	55384	the child	15536	" It 's Sir Derby Oaks taking his fencing lesson , "
55391	55402	55383	55384	the child	15536	" He takes it Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . "
55440	55459	55433	55433	Pendennis	693	" I believe I have the honour of speaking to Captain Costigan - My name is Major Pendennis . "
55473	55488	55460	55461	The Captain	14344	" Major , the honer is moine ; I 'm deloighted to see ye . "
55663	55690	55692	55692	Costigan	847	" Me daughter - me friend , Mr. Bows - me gallant young pupil and friend , I may call ' um , Sir Derby Oaks , "
55711	55724	55692	55692	Costigan	847	" In one moment , Meejor , I 'm your humble servant , "
55907	55917	55918	55918	he	847	" I need n't apologoise to ye , Meejor , "
55929	55939	55918	55918	he	847	" for receiving ye in me shirt - sleeves . "
55940	55961	55963	55964	the Major	2155	" An old soldier ca n't be better employed than in teaching a young one the use of his sword , "
55968	55986	55963	55964	the Major	2155	" I remember in old times hearing that you could use yours pretty well , Captain Costigan . "
55987	55998	56000	56001	the other	14365	" What , ye've heard of Jack Costigan , Major , "
56113	56124	56125	56126	the Major	2155	" But we will talk of these matters another time , "
56136	56153	56155	56155	he	2155	" it is to Miss Fotheringay that I came to pay my respects to - day ; "
56183	56196	56197	56198	the Major	2155	" I had heard of your performances from my nephew , madam , "
56201	56291	56197	56198	the Major	2155	" who raves about you , as I believe you know pretty well . But Arthur is but a boy , and a wild enthusiastic young fellow , whose opinions one must not take au pied de la lettre ; and I confess I was anxious to judge for myself . Permit me to say your performance delighted and astonished me . I have seen our best actresses , and , on my word , I think you surpass them all . You are as majestic as Mrs. Siddons . "
56292	56300	56301	56301	Costigan	847	" Faith , I always said so , "
56309	56316	56301	56301	Costigan	847	" Major , take a chair . "
56348	56357	56358	56358	he	847	" You are as pathetic as Miss O'Neill , "
56366	56408	56358	56358	he	847	" your snatches of song reminded me of Mrs. Jordan in her best time , when we were young men , Captain Costigan ; and your manner reminded me of Mars . Did you ever see the Mars , Miss Fotheringay ? "
56409	56418	56420	56421	Miss Emily	677	" There was two Mahers in Crow Street , "
56423	56436	56420	56421	Miss Emily	677	" Fanny was well enough , but Biddy was no great things . "
56437	56453	56455	56456	the parent	3468	" Sure , the Major means the god of war , Milly , my dear , "
56458	56481	56482	56483	the Major	2155	" It is not that Mars I meant , though Venus , I suppose , may be pardoned for thinking about him , "
56598	56601	56603	56603	he	968	" So , "
56605	56613	56615	56615	he	968	" a rival is in the field ; "
56648	56796	56615	56615	he	968	" I fear I interrupted your fencing lesson ; but my stay in Chatteris is very short , and I was anxious to make myself known to my old fellow - campaigner Captain Costigan , and to see a lady nearer who had charmed me so much from the stage . I was not the only man epris last night , Miss Fotheringay if I must call you so , though your own family name is a very ancient and noble one . There was a reverend friend of mine , who went home in raptures with Ophelia ; and I saw Sir Derby Oaks fling a bouquet which no actress ever merited better . I should have brought one myself , had I known what I was going to see . Are not those the very flowers in a glass of water on the mantelpiece yonder ? "
56797	56805	56807	56808	Miss Fotheringay	677	" I am very fond of flowers , "
56826	56841	56820	56821	the Baronet	15718	" Sweets to the sweet - is n't that the expression of the play ? "
56853	56878	56880	56881	Sir Derby	968	" ' Pon my life , I do n't know . Very likely it is . I ai n't much of a literary man , "
56883	56888	56889	56890	the Major	2155	" Is it possible ? "
56933	56934	56923	56923	I	0	" "
56937	56951	56952	56952	He	2289	" said the other , and gave a sulky wag of his head . "
56957	56961	56963	56963	he	2289	" continued Pendennis . "
56966	57036	56963	56963	he	2289	" cried Miss Fotheringay , rolling her eyes first upon the Major with surprise , then towards Sir Derby with gratitude - but the latter was proof against those glances : and far from appearing to be pleased that the Apothecary , his father , should have saved Major Pendennis 's life , the young man actually looked as if he wished the event had turned the other way . "
57049	57059	57044	57047	a very good doctor	3481	" the young gentleman said by way of reply . "
57094	57190	57088	57089	Miss Fotheringay	677	" And , in spite of the young lady 's imploring looks and appealing smiles , the Dragoon bowed stiffly out of the room , and the clatter of his sabre was heard as he strode down the creaking stair ; and the angry tones of his voice as he cursed little Tom Creed , who was disporting in the passage , and whose peg - top Sir Derby kicked away with an oath into the street . The Major did not smile in the least , though he had every reason to be amused . "
57207	57213	57191	57205	Monstrous handsome young man that - as fine a looking soldier as ever I saw	3483	" he said to Costigan . "
57226	57230	57191	57205	Monstrous handsome young man that - as fine a looking soldier as ever I saw	3483	" answered Costigan . "
57263	57264	57258	57258	he	3485	" "
57269	57276	57265	57267	A perfect champion	3487	" said the Major , laughing . "
57287	57288	57282	57283	the ladies	13951	" "
57305	57309	57301	57301	he	3485	" said Milly ; "
57316	57317	57311	57311	he	3485	" "
57324	57471	57318	57318	He	3485	" Mr. Bows said ; on which Milly replied , that the Baronet had ridden third in the steeple - chase on his horse Tareaways , and the Major began to comprehend that the young lady herself was not of a particular genius , and to wonder how she should be so stupid and act so well . Costigan , with Irish hospitality , of course pressed refreshment upon his guest : and the Major , who was no more hungry than you are after a Lord Mayor 's dinner , declared that he should like a biscuit and a glass of wine above all things , as he felt quite faint from long fasting - but he knew that to receive small kindnesses flatters the donors very much , and that people must needs grow well disposed towards you as they give you their hospitality . "
57482	57655	57478	57478	Milly	677	" Costigan said , winking to his child - and that lady , turning to her father a glance of intelligence , went out of the room , and down the stair , where she softly summoned her little emissary Master Tommy Creed : and giving him a piece of money , ordered him to go buy a pint of Madara wine at the Grapes , and sixpennyworth of sorted biscuits at the baker 's , and to return in a hurry , when he might have two biscuits for himself . Whilst Tommy Creed was gone on this errand , Miss Costigan sate below with Mrs. Creed , telling her landlady how Mr. Arthur Pendennis 's uncle , the Major , was above - stairs ; a nice , soft - spoken old gentleman ; that butter would n't melt in his mouth : and how Sir Derby had gone out of the room in a rage of jealousy , and thinking what must be done to pacify both of them . "
57666	57678	57656	57656	She	3489	" said Mr. Costigan , as the girl left the room . "
57689	57695	57682	57682	you	3335	" answered Pendennis , gallantly , "
57729	57730	57719	57719	I	0	" "
57788	57789	57771	57771	she	677	" "
57794	57802	57771	57771	she	677	" said Mr. Bows , rather drily . "
57834	57904	57906	57906	you	3499	" - and he gave the young lady a look , which intimated that they had much better leave the room and the two elders together . At this order Miss Hebe took up her bonnet and shawl , looking uncommonly pretty , good - humoured , and smiling : and Bows gathered up his roll of papers , and hobbled across the room for his hat and cane . "
57909	57914	57906	57906	you	3499	" said the Major . "
57970	58018	58019	58020	The lad	14326	" Miss Fotheringay made a low curtsey at the conclusion of this gallant speech , and the Major followed her retreating steps to the door , where he squeezed her hand with the kindest and most paternal pressure . Bows was puzzled with this exhibition of cordiality : "
58034	58043	58019	58020	The lad	14326	" he thought - and so they departed . "
58048	58142	58019	58020	The lad	14326	" thought Major Pendennis ; and as for Mr. Costigan he profited instantaneously by his daughter 's absence to drink up the rest of the wine ; and tossed off one bumper after another of the Madeira from the Grapes , with an eager shaking hand . The Major came up to the table , and took up his glass and drained it with a jovial smack . If it had been Lord Steyne 's particular , and not public - house Cape , he could not have appeared to relish it more . "
58149	58153	58146	58147	Captain Costigan	847	" he said . "
58229	58230	58225	58225	she	3507	" "
58244	58250	58238	58240	a good girl	3510	" said the delighted father ; "
58343	58344	58341	58341	Major	693	" "
58359	58364	58345	58345	I	0	" said the Major , "
58432	58433	58439	58439	Major	3335	" "
58445	58450	58439	58439	Major	3335	" cried Jack enraptured . "
58509	58535	58504	58507	poor old Jack Costigan	3536	" - The Captain suited the action to the word , and his bloodshot eyes were suffused with water , as he addressed the Major . "
58542	58547	58539	58539	you	3335	" the other said . "
58566	58567	58561	58561	you	847	" "
58575	58609	58610	58610	I	0	" asked Jack , who was at a too heroic and sentimental pitch to descend from it . You were speaking about our splendid mansion - my sister 's house , I mean . "
58653	58713	58643	58643	he	739	" cried the Captain with much dignity . The Major smiled as he recognised a shaft of his own bow . It was he who had set Pen upon the idea of sitting in Parliament for the neighbouring borough - and the poor lad had evidently been bragging on the subject to Costigan and the lady of his affections . "
58721	58725	58643	58643	he	739	" he said . "
58777	58778	58779	58779	I	0	" "
58789	58794	58779	58779	I	0	" said Costigan majestically , "

58811	58823	58808	58808	your	2261	" thought the Major ; but he only smiled and bowed . "
58878	58879	58880	58880	You	2261	" "
58893	58898	58880	58880	You	2261	" the Major continued : "

58969	58975	58965	58967	a country apothecary	3545	" cried out Major Pendennis ; "
58990	58991	58983	58983	he	13873	" "
59002	59007	58996	58996	you	693	" said Mr. Costigan , "

59220	59225	59212	59212	I	0	" said Major Pendennis . "

59391	59403	59405	59405	you	2261	" exclaimed the General , with an outbreak of wrath . - "
59480	59481	59475	59475	he	2245	" "
59485	59491	59482	59483	Mr. Costigan	680	" cried out the Major . "
59509	59514	59507	59507	sir	2261	" said the other . "
59659	59660	59652	59657	the man that shall do it	3614	" "
59704	59714	59715	59715	You	2261	" the Major said , still with perfect coolness . "
59727	59742	59715	59715	You	2261	" answered the Captain , as he pulled his ragged whiskers over his chin . "
59810	59811	59812	59812	I	0	" "
59824	59829	59812	59812	I	0	" said the Captain . "
59847	59848	59849	59849	I	0	" "
59856	59867	59849	59849	I	0	" said the Captain , with rather a disturbed air . "
59893	59894	59888	59888	I	0	" "
59900	59913	59915	59915	he	2239	" cried the Major , starting up and putting on his hat . "
60114	60115	60106	60106	I	0	" "
60134	60146	60132	60132	me	0	" Mr. Costigan said , with a look of tremendous severity . "
60157	60180	60181	60181	Ye	2261	" the Major asked , turning round on the threshold of the door , and looking the intrepid Costigan in the face . "
60201	60210	60181	60181	Ye	2261	" Mr. Costigan said in a stately manner . "
60225	60226	60228	60228	him	14252	" "
60235	60247	60232	60233	Mr. Costigan	680	" cried out the Major , almost beside himself with rage . "
60257	60519	60248	60248	I	0	" And Captain Costigan bowed a magnificent bow of defiance to Major Pendennis over the landing - place as the latter retreated down the stairs . CHAPTER XII In which a Shooting Match is proposed Early mention has been made in this history of Mr. Garbetts , Principal Tragedian , a promising and athletic young actor , of jovial habits and irregular inclinations , between whom and Mr. Costigan there was a considerable intimacy . They were the chief ornaments of the convivial club held at the Magpie Hotel ; they helped each other in various bill transactions in which they had been engaged , with the mutual loan of each other 's valuable signatures . They were friends , in fine : although Mr. Garbetts seldom called at Costigan 's house , being disliked by Miss Fotheringay , of whom in her turn Mrs. Garbetts was considerably jealous . The truth is , that Garbetts had paid his court to Miss Fotheringay and been refused by her , before he offered his hand to Mrs. G. Their history , however , forms no part of our present scheme - suffice it , Mr. Garbetts was called in by Captain Costigan immediately after his daughter and Mr. Bows had quitted the house , as a friend proper to be consulted at the actual juncture . He was a large man , with a loud voice and fierce aspect , who had the finest legs of the whole company , and could break a poker in mere sport across his stalwart arm . "
60524	60533	60522	60522	Tommy	989	" said Mr. Costigan to the little messenger , "
60569	60905	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" So Tommy went his way ; and presently Mr. Garbetts and the whisky came . Captain Costigan did not disclose to him the whole of the previous events , of which the reader is in possession ; but , with the aid of the spirits - and - water , he composed a letter of a threatening nature to Major Pendennis 's address , in which he called upon that gentleman to offer no hindrance to the marriage projected between Mr. Arthur Pendennis and his daughter , Miss Fotheringay , and to fix an early day for its celebration : or , in any other case , to give him the satisfaction which was usual between gentlemen of honour . And should Major Pendennis be disinclined to this alternative , the Captain hinted , that he would force him to accept by the use of a horsewhip , which he should employ upon the Major 's person . The precise terms of this letter we can not give , for reasons which shall be specified presently ; but it was , no doubt , couched in the Captain 's finest style , and sealed elaborately with the great silver seal of the Costigans - the only bit of the family plate which the Captain possessed . Garbetts was despatched then with this message and letter ; and bidding Heaven bless ' um the General squeezed his ambassador 's hand , and saw him depart . Then he took down his venerable and murderous duelling - pistols , with flint locks , that had done the business of many a pretty fellow in Dublin : and having examined these , and seen that they were in a satisfactory condition , he brought from the drawer all Pen 's letters and poems which he kept there , and which he always read before he permitted his Emily to enjoy their perusal . In a score of minutes Garbetts came back with an anxious and crestfallen countenance . "
60911	60916	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" the Captain said . "
60921	60925	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" said Garbetts . "
60932	60963	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" asked Costigan , trying the lock of one of the ancient pistols , and bringing it to a level with his oi - as he called that bloodshot orb . "
60969	60974	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" asked Mr. Garbetts . "
60982	60983	60906	60906	Ye've	3652	" "
60998	61004	60996	60996	Captain	3508	" Garbetts said , aghast . "
61037	61038	61029	61029	meself	3656	" "
61047	61052	61053	61053	I	0	" Mr. Garbetts replied . "
61075	61103	61072	61072	your	3508	" and , to the surprise and indignation of Captain Costigan , his emissary flung the letter down , with its great sprawling superscription and blotched seal . "
61123	61132	61133	61133	I	0	" cried out the Captain in a fury . "
61148	61153	61146	61146	Captain	3508	" said Mr. Garbetts . "
61160	61165	61156	61157	the devil	3662	" asked the other . "
61180	61189	61190	61192	The minion Tatham	995	" the tragedian answered in a sepulchral voice . "
61198	61199	61190	61192	The minion Tatham	995	" "
61204	61208	61200	61202	The cowardly scoundthrel	3665	" roared Costigan . "
61223	61224	61209	61209	He	3655	" "
61238	61244	61246	61246	I	0	" the tragedian doggedly said , "
61261	61262	61246	61246	I	0	" "
61281	61490	61272	61272	my	0	" said Captain Costigan , quoting Sir Lucius O'Trigger , which character he had performed with credit , both off and on the stage , and after some more parley between the couple they separated in not very good humour . Their colloquy has been here condensed , as the reader knows the main point upon which it turned . But the latter will now see how it is impossible to give a correct account of the letter which the Captain wrote to Major Pendennis , as it was never opened at all by that gentleman . When Miss Costigan came home from rehearsal , which she did in the company of the faithful Mr. Bows , she found her father pacing up and down their apartment in a great state of agitation , and in the midst of a powerful odour of spirits - and - water , which , as it appeared , had not succeeded in pacifying his disordered mind . The Pendennis papers were on the table surrounding the empty goblets and now useless teaspoon which had served to hold and mix the Captain 's liquor and his friend 's . As Emily entered he seized her in his arms , and cried out , "
61501	61515	61492	61492	yourself	3668	" in a voice of agony , and with eyes brimful of tears . "
61522	61532	61520	61520	Papa	953	" Miss Fotheringay said , pushing back her sire . "
61544	61545	61533	61533	Ye	953	" "
61565	61571	61558	61558	I	0	" cried the bereaved father - "
61584	61585	61579	61579	I	0	" "
61597	61607	61594	61595	Captain dear	3673	" said Bows , mimicking his friend 's accent ; "
61625	61626	61613	61620	that soft - spoken gentleman in the wig	3674	" "
61637	61669	61672	61672	he	3675	" roared Cos . Miss Milly , it must be premised , had fled to her room out of his embrace , and was taking off her bonnet and shawl there . "
61682	61687	61676	61676	He	3675	" the other said . "
61695	61696	61690	61690	he	3675	" "
61705	61710	61700	61700	He	3675	" the Captain said . "
61756	61757	61742	61742	scoundthrels	3681	" "
61766	61834	61835	61835	I	0	" said Mr. Bows , growing rather excited . Costigan then told him the Major 's statement that the young Pendennis had not two thousand , nor two hundred pounds a year ; and expressed his fury that he should have permitted such an impostor to coax and wheedle his innocent girl , and that he should have nourished such a viper in his own personal bosom . "
61845	61849	61835	61835	I	0	" said Costigan ; "
61881	61882	61875	61875	he	3684	" "
61890	61894	61885	61885	you	3685	" said Bows . "
61913	62164	61902	61902	Bows	833	" and he rapped upon the battered old pistol - case in an ominous and savage manner . Bows had often heard him appeal to that box of death , with which he proposed to sacrifice his enemies ; but the Captain did not tell him that he had actually written and sent a challenge to Major Pendennis , and Mr. Bows therefore rather disregarded the pistols in the present instance . At this juncture Miss Fotheringay returned to the common sitting - room from her private apartment , looking perfectly healthy , happy , and unconcerned , a striking and wholesome contrast to her father , who was in a delirious tremor of grief , anger , and other agitation . She brought in a pair of ex - white satin shoes with her , which she proposed to rub as clean as might be with bread - crumb : intending to go mad with them upon next Tuesday evening in Ophelia , in which character she was to reappear on that night . She looked at the papers on the table ; stopped as if she was going to ask a question , but thought better of it , and going to the cupboard , selected an eligible piece of bread wherewith she might operate on the satin slippers : and afterwards coming back to the table , seated herself there commodiously with the shoes , and then asked her father , in her honest , Irish brogue , "
62199	62200	62201	62202	O Emilee	1001	" "
62204	62209	62201	62202	O Emilee	1001	" cried the Captain , "
62234	62262	62263	62263	He	3689	" and he looked in the most tragical way at Mr. Bows , opposite ; who , in his turn , gazed somewhat anxiously at Miss Costigan . "
62278	62282	62283	62285	All them children	3696	" she said . "
62291	62292	62293	62293	He	3689	" "
62313	62318	62319	62319	I	0	" cried the Captain . "
62330	62331	62327	62328	an impostor	3698	" "
62341	62345	62334	62336	the poor fellow	2665	" asked Emily . "
62358	62365	62348	62348	He	3689	" Miss Emily 's papa said . "
62514	62515	62516	62519	That soft old gentleman	3712	" "
62529	62581	62523	62523	he	3689	" continued Emily , still imperturbable . Costigan informed Milly , that when she was gone , Major Pendennis told him in his double - faced Pall Mall polite manner , that young Arthur had no fortune at all , that the Major had asked him Costigan to go to the lawyers "
62600	62662	62594	62594	I	0	" the Captain parenthetically remarked , and see the lad 's father 's will and finally , that an infernal swindle had been practised upon him by the pair , and that he was resolved either on a marriage , or on the blood of both of them . Milly looked very grave and thoughtful , rubbing the white satin shoes . "
62680	62685	62678	62678	Papa	953	" she said sententiously . "
62698	62702	62688	62689	the villain	3714	" asked Costigan . "
62712	62717	62703	62705	The poor fellow	2665	" answered the girl . "
62738	62739	62740	62740	He	3689	" "
62753	62758	62751	62751	Milly	677	" answered the father . "
62865	62866	62863	62863	bedad	3721	" "
62878	62884	62869	62869	you	851	" said Bows , laughing . "
62897	62898	62895	62895	Captain	3508	" "
62908	62913	62901	62901	you	851	" roared the General . "
62953	62954	62933	62933	I	0	" "
62963	62972	62973	62974	Poor lad	3737	" sighed out Miss Costigan , rather plaintively . "
63015	63029	63010	63010	he	739	" she added , rather softly , and rubbing away at the shoe . "
63042	63050	63051	63051	He	739	" Mr. Bows said , rather savagely . "
63120	63121	63116	63116	he	739	" "
63143	63149	63131	63131	Bows	833	" Miss Milly said sententiously . "
63157	63166	63131	63131	Bows	833	" said Bows , with a bitter curse - "
63180	63181	63184	63185	old fools	3744	" "
63201	63216	63192	63192	You	833	" the imperious beauty said , with a conscious glance at the old gentleman . "
63246	63247	63249	63250	the boy	13873	" "
63252	63257	63249	63250	the boy	13873	" said Mr. Bows . "
63274	63275	63271	63272	Miss Costigan	675	" "
63286	63298	63284	63284	Bows	833	" said Miss Fotheringay , placidly , rubbing the second shoe . "
63374	63391	63354	63361	an old lady that 's testy and cross	3752	" Sure , it 's near dinner time , and Suky not laid the cloth yet . "
63395	63426	63354	63361	an old lady that 's testy and cross	3752	" added Miss Costigan quite simply , ' suppose there was a family ? - why , Papa , we should n't be as well off as we are now . "
63427	63440	63442	63443	the father	15077	" ' Deed , then , you would not , Milly dear , "
63445	63471	63473	63473	Milly	677	" And there 's an end to all the fine talk about Mrs. Arthur Pendennis of Fairoaks Park - the member of Parliament 's lady , "
63479	63540	63473	63473	Milly	677	" Pretty carriages and horses we should have to ride ! - that you were always talking about , Papa ! But it 's always the same . If a man looked at me , you fancied he was going to marry me ; and if he had a good coat , you fancied he was as rich as Crazes . "
63541	63546	63548	63549	Mr. Bows	833	" - As Croesus , "
63551	63667	63548	63549	Mr. Bows	833	" Well , call ' um what ye like . But it 's a fact now that Papa has married me these eight years a score of times . Was n't I to be my Lady Poldoody of Oystherstown Castle ? Then there was the Navy Captain at Portsmouth , and the old surgeon at Norwich , and the Methodist preacher here last year , and who knows how many more ? Well , I bet a penny , with all your scheming , I shall die Milly Costigan at last . So poor little Arthur has no money ? Stop and take dinner , Bows ; we 've a beautiful beef - steak pudding . "
63668	63680	63682	63682	Bows	833	" I wonder whether she is on with Sir Derby Oaks , "
63693	63726	63682	63682	Bows	833	" The dodges of women beat all comprehension ; and I am sure she would n't let the lad off so easily , if she had not some other scheme on hand . "
64142	64167	64196	64197	Miss Fotheringay	677	" what the juice they were to say to the lad if he remained steady to his engagement , and they broke from theirs ? "
64168	64182	64184	64184	Bows	833	" What ? do n't you know how to throw a man over ? "
64186	64194	64184	64184	Bows	833	" ask a woman to tell you ? "
64214	64287	64196	64197	Miss Fotheringay	677	" Papa writes to Arthur to know what settlements he proposes to make in event of a marriage ; and asks what his means are . Arthur writes back and says what he 's got , and you 'll find it 's as the Major says , I 'll go bail . Then papa writes , and says it 's not enough , and the match had best be at an end . "
64288	64313	64315	64316	Mr. Bows	833	" And , of course , you enclose a parting line , in which you say you will always regard him as a brother , "
64325	64334	64321	64321	his	833	" Of course , and so I shall , "
64339	64366	64336	64337	Miss Fotheringay	677	" He 's a most worthy young man , I 'm sure . I 'll thank ye hand me the salt . Them filberts is beautiful . "
64367	64388	64390	64391	Mr. Bows	833	" And there will be no noses pulled , Cos , my boy ? I 'm sorry you 're baulked , "
64393	64400	64402	64402	Cos	852	" Dad , I suppose not , "
64409	64435	64402	64402	Cos	852	" What 'll ye do about them letters , and verses , and pomes , Milly , darling ? - Ye must send 'em back . "
64436	64446	64447	64447	Bows	833	" Wigsby would give a hundred pound for 'em , "
64454	64463	64465	64466	Captain Costigan	847	" ' Deed , then , he would , "
64473	64476	64478	64479	Miss Milly	677	" Papa ! "
64482	64552	64478	64479	Miss Milly	677	" Ye would n't be for not sending the poor boy his letters back ? Them letters and pomes is mine . They were very long , and full of all sorts of nonsense , and Latin , and things I could n't understand the half of ; indeed I 've not read 'em all ; but we 'll send 'em back to him when the proper time comes . "
65288	65296	65297	65297	he	3802	" The impudent bog - trotting scamp , "
65300	65381	65297	65297	he	3802	" dare to threaten me ! Dare to talk of permitting his damned Costigans to marry with the Pendennises ! Send me a challenge ! If the fellow can get anything in the shape of a gentleman to carry it , I have the greatest mind in life not to baulk him . - Psha ! what would people say if I were to go out with a tipsy mountebank , about a row with an actress in a barn ! "
65489	65497	65499	65500	that gentleman	14737	" dammin and cussin upstairs and downstairs , "
65726	65738	65715	65717	the modest youth	3833	" O , you 're busy - call again another time . "
65836	65848	65849	65849	he	740	" You seem to like my dressing - gown , sir , "
65855	65892	65849	65849	he	740	" A pretty thing , is n't it ? Neat , but not in the least gaudy . And how do you do , Major Pendennis , sir , and how does the world treat you ? "
65924	66037	65849	65849	he	740	" I have had an interview with that Irishman you may speak before my friend , Mr. Tatham here , who knows all the affairs of the family , and it has not , I own , been very satisfactory . He wo n't believe that my nephew is poor : he says we are both liars : he did me the honour to hint that I was a coward , as I took leave . And I thought when you knocked at the door , that you might be the gentleman whom I expect with a challenge from Mr. Costigan - that is how the world treats me , Mr. Foker . "
66038	66051	66053	66054	Mr. Tatham	740	" You do n't mean that Irishman , the actress 's father ? "
66069	66099	66053	66054	Mr. Tatham	740	" That Irishman , the actress 's father - the very man . Have not you heard what a fool my nephew has made of himself about the girl ? "
66275	66284	66285	66285	he	740	" I can understand the reason , Major , "
66288	66396	66285	66285	he	740	" why the fellow would not come to my office to ascertain the truth of the statements which you made him . - We have a writ out against him and another disreputable fellow , one of the play - actors , for a bill given to Mr. Skinner of this city , a most respectable Grocer and Wine and Spirit Merchant , and a Member of the Society of Friends . This Costigan came crying to Mr. Skinner , - crying in the shop , sir , - and we have not proceeded against him or the other , as neither were worth powder and shot . "
66442	66456	66457	66457	he	740	" Can I have the honour of speaking with Major Pendennis in private ? "
66460	66485	66457	66457	he	740	" I have a few words for your ear , sir . I am the bearer of a mission from my friend Captain Costigan , "
66518	66526	66528	66529	Mr. Foker	801	" Hullo , Garbetts , speak up ! "
66533	66549	66551	66552	Mr. Tatham	740	" Why , bless my soul , it is the other party to the bill ! "
66554	66564	66551	66552	Mr. Tatham	740	" I say , sir ; stop I say . "
66619	66630	66613	66614	Mr. Foker	801	" By Jove , it was a good ' un . "
66643	66656	66657	66658	young Foker	801	" I do n't think there 'll be any fight , Major , "
66667	66700	66657	66658	young Foker	801	" If there is , the old gentleman - your name Tatham ? - very happy to make your acquaintance , Mr. Tatham - may send the bailiffs to separate the men ; "
66724	66732	66733	66733	he	740	" It seems to me , sir , "
66739	66752	66733	66733	he	740	" that you always arrive to put me into good - humour . "
66934	66944	66946	66947	Mr. Foker	801	" Just done breakfast I see - how do ? "
66956	66965	66967	66968	Miss Fotheringay	677	" Get out , you funny little man , "
66970	66985	66990	66990	he	801	" You mean come in , answered the other . - Here we are ! "
67085	67093	67094	67094	she	677	" You 're the drollest little man , "
67288	67299	67301	67301	he	801	" I knew it would n't do , Miss Foth , "
67308	67370	67301	67301	he	801	" Could n't do . Did n't like to put my hand into the bag , but knew it could n't do . He 's too young for you : too green : a deal too green : and he turns out to be poor as Job . Ca n't have him at no price , can she , Mr. Bo ? "
67371	67380	67382	67383	the Fotheringay	677	" Indeed he 's a nice poor boy , "
67387	67392	67394	67394	Bows	833	" Poor little beggar , "
67497	67508	67509	67509	she	675	" It all comes of believing Papa 's silly stories , "
67512	67521	67509	67509	she	675	" faith I 'll choose for meself another time "
67621	67678	67607	67608	the Major	2155	" He agreed to dine with me , and I think after the - after the little shindy this morning , in which I must say the General was wrong , it would look kind , you know . - I know the Major fell in love with you , Miss Foth : he said so . "
67679	67688	67689	67689	Bows	833	" So she may be Mrs. Pendennis still , "
67695	67708	67689	67689	Bows	833	" No , thank you , Mr. F. - I 've dined . "
67709	67718	67720	67721	Miss Costigan	675	" Sure , that was at three o'clock , "
67729	67738	67720	67721	Miss Costigan	675	" and I ca n't go without you . "
67739	67749	67689	67689	Bows	833	" We 'll have lobster - salad and champagne , "
68054	68058	68060	68061	Mr. Foker	845	" All right , "
68400	68410	68411	68411	he	2155	" Will you come into the drawing - room ? "
68414	68422	68411	68411	he	2155	" I want to speak to you . "
68434	68439	68440	68440	she	697	" What is it ? "
68444	68452	68440	68440	she	697	" The affair is at an end , "
68457	68494	68453	68454	Major Pendennis	693	" He has a letter there giving him his dismissal . I dictated it myself yesterday . There are a few lines from the lady , too , bidding him farewell . It is all over . "
68766	68773	68774	68774	Pen	799	" What - what is this ? "
68777	68804	68774	68774	Pen	799	" It 's some joke . This is not her writing . This is some servant 's writing . Who 's playing these tricks upon me ? "
68805	68814	68815	68816	the Major	2155	" It comes under her father 's envelope , "
68819	68835	68815	68816	the Major	2155	" Those letters you had before were not in her hand : that is hers . "
68836	68842	68844	68844	Pen	799	" How do you know ? "
68848	68855	68856	68857	the uncle	2890	" I saw her write it , "
68882	68921	68923	68923	Pen	799	" How came you to see her ? How came you between me and her ? What have I ever done to you that you should - Oh , it 's not true ! it 's not true ! "
68931	68966	68923	68923	Pen	799	" She ca n't have done it of her own accord . She ca n't mean it . She 's pledged to me . Who has told her lies to break her from me ? "
68967	68978	68979	68980	Major Pendennis	693	" Lies are not told in the family , Arthur , "
68983	69083	68979	68980	Major Pendennis	693	" I told her the truth , which was , that you had no money to maintain her , for her foolish father had represented you to be rich . And when she knew how poor you were , she withdrew at once , and without any persuasion of mine . She was quite right . She is ten years older than you are . She is perfectly unfitted to be your wife , and knows it . Look at that handwriting , and ask yourself , is such a woman fitted to be the companion of your mother ? "
69084	69095	69096	69096	Arthur	739	" I will know from herself if it is true , "
69104	69160	69162	69163	the Major	2155	" Wo n't you take my word of honour ? Her letters were written by a confidant of hers , who writes better than she can - look here . Here 's one from the lady to your friend , Mr. Foker . You have seen her with Miss Costigan , as whose amanuensis she acted "
69188	69194	69196	69196	Pen	799	" It 's not that , "
69204	69223	69196	69196	Pen	799	" I suppose what you say is true , sir , but I 'll hear it from herself . "
69224	69227	69229	69230	his mother	13927	" Arthur ! "
69232	69238	69240	69240	Arthur	739	" I will see her , "
69242	69263	69240	69240	Arthur	739	" I 'll ask her to marry me , once more . I will . No one shall prevent me . "
69264	69320	69229	69230	his mother	13927	" What , a woman who spells affection with one f ? Nonsense , sir . Be a man , and remember that your mother is a lady . She was never made to associate with that tipsy old swindler or his daughter . Be a man and forget her , as she does you . "
69321	69333	69334	69334	Helen	673	" Be a man and comfort your mother , my Arthur , "
70714	70724	70702	70702	Cora	1019	" O God , there 's blood upon him ! "
70762	70772	70748	70749	Mr. Dolphin	1023	" By Jove , Billy , she 'll do ! "
70773	70780	70782	70783	old Billy	1024	" Who taught her that dodge ? "
70792	70812	70782	70783	old Billy	1024	" I remember her at the Olympic , and hang me if she could say Bo to a goose . "
71536	71541	71524	71524	you	4041	" Brava , Brava , "
71693	71699	71701	71702	Mr. Wenham	1032	" The secret is out , "
71704	71713	71701	71702	Mr. Wenham	1032	" there 's a woman in the case . "
71714	71729	71731	71735	the gentleman behind the curtain	4058	" Why , d - - it , Wenham , he 's your age , "
71737	71753	71755	71756	Mr. Wenham	1032	" Pour les ames bien nees , l'amour ne compte pas le nombre des annees , "
71763	71789	71755	71756	Mr. Wenham	1032	" For my part , I hope to be a victim till I die , and to break my heart every year of my life . "
71797	71820	71755	71756	Mr. Wenham	1032	" My lord , you need not talk ; I 'm three years younger than you , and twice as well conserve . "
71821	71828	71830	71832	the great man	4038	" Wenham , you affect me , "
71841	71953	71837	71837	his	4038	" By - - you do . I like to see a fellow preserving all the illusions of youth up to our time of life - and keeping his heart warm as yours is . Hang it , sir , it 's a comfort to meet with such a generous , candid creature . - Who 's that gal in the second row , with blue ribbons , third from the stage - fine gal . Yes , you and I are sentimentalists . Wagg I do n't think so much cares - it 's the stomach rather more than the heart with you , eh , Wagg , my boy ? "
71954	71962	71964	71965	Mr. Wagg	1033	" I like everything that 's good , "
71969	72014	72015	72015	he	1033	" Beauty and Burgundy , Venus and Venison . I do n't say that Venus 's turtles are to be despised , because they do n't cook them at the London Tavern : but - but tell us about old Pendennis , Mr. Wenham , "
72055	72097	72046	72046	he	669	" Yes , I 've heard that joke about Venus 's turtle and the London Tavern before - you begin to fail , my poor Wagg . If you do n't mind I shall be obliged to have a new Jester , "
72107	72117	72098	72099	Lord Steyne	669	" Go on , Wenham , about old Pendennis . "
72118	72122	72124	72124	he	1033	" Dear Wenham , "
72132	72413	72127	72128	Mr. Wenham	1032	" as you have had my character in your hands for the last three weeks , and no doubt have torn me to shreds , according to your custom , I think you can afford to be good - humoured by way of variety , and to do me a service . It is a delicate matter , entre nous , une affaire de coeur . There is a young friend of mine who is gone wild about a certain Miss Fotheringay , an actress at the theatre here , and I must own to you , as handsome a woman , and , as it appears to me , as good an actress as ever put on rouge . She does Ophelia , Lady Teazle , Mrs. Haller - that sort of thing . Upon my word , she is as splendid as Georges in her best days , and as far as I know , utterly superior to anything we have on our scene . I want a London engagement for her . Ca n't you get your friend Dolphin to come and see her - to engage her - to take her out of this place ? A word from a noble friend of ours you understand would be invaluable , and if you could get the Gaunt House interest for me - I will promise anything I can in return for your service - which I shall consider one of the greatest that can be done to me . Do , do this now as a good fellow , which I always said you were : and in return , command yours truly , A. Pendennis . "
72414	72421	72423	72424	Mr. Wenham	1032	" It 's a clear case , "
72431	72438	72423	72424	Mr. Wenham	1032	" old Pendennis is in love . "
72439	72452	72454	72455	Mr. Wagg	1033	" And wants to get the woman up to London - evidently , "
72457	72472	72474	72475	Mr. Wenham	1032	" I should like to see Pendennis on his knees , with the rheumatism , "
72477	72490	72492	72492	Wagg	1033	" Or accommodating the beloved object with a lock of his hair , "
72494	72497	72499	72501	the great man	4038	" Stuff . "
72503	72585	72588	72588	he	4038	" He has relations in the country , has n't he ? He said something about a nephew , whose interest could return a member . It is the nephew 's affair , depend on it . The young one is in a scrape . I was myself - when I was in the fifth form at Eton - a market - gardener 's daughter - and swore I 'd marry her . I was mad about her - poor Polly ! "
72615	72646	72588	72588	he	4038	" But I say , she must be a fine woman from Pendennis 's account . Have in Dolphin , and let us hear if he knows anything of her . "
72775	72794	72796	72797	the manager	14771	" How do , Mr. Wenham ? How 's his lordship to - night ? Looks uncommonly well , "
72986	72996	72997	72998	Poor Pen	799	" The last night of Miss Fotheringay 's engagement . "
73125	73134	73136	73136	he	1023	" We may sit on the same bridge , "
73138	73324	73136	73136	he	1023	" we have been in the same boat for a long time . You are not the only man who has made a fool of himself about that woman . And I have less excuse than you , because I am older and know her better . She has no more heart than the stone you are leaning on ; and it or you or I might fall into the water , and never come up again , and she would n't care . Yes - she would care for me , because she wants me to teach her : and she wo n't be able to get on without me , and will be forced to send for me from London . But she would n't if she did n't want me . She has no heart and no head , and no sense , and no feelings , and no griefs or cares , whatever . I was going to say no pleasures - but the fact is , she does like her dinner , and she is pleased when people admire her . "
73325	73330	73332	73332	Pen	799	" And you do ? "
73349	73363	73365	73366	the other	14365	" It 's a habit , like taking snuff , or drinking drams , "
73368	73437	73365	73366	the other	14365	" I 've been taking her these five years , and ca n't do without her . It was I made her . If she does n't send for me , I shall follow her : but I know she 'll send for me . She wants me . Some day she 'll marry , and fling me over , as I do the end of this cigar . "
73872	73881	73882	73883	Major Pendennis	693	" Depend on it , my dear creature , "
73890	73966	73882	73883	Major Pendennis	693	" the boy will recover . As soon as we get her out of the country we will take him somewhere , and show him a little life . Meantime make yourself easy about him . Half a fellow 's pangs at losing a woman result from vanity more than affection . To be left by a woman is the deuce and all , to be sure ; but look how easily we leave 'em . "
75209	75230	75203	75203	his	1047	" Artises come and take hoff the Church from that there tree - It was a Habby once , sir : "
77214	77218	77322	77322	himself	799	" Gracious goodness , "
77223	77295	77322	77322	himself	799	" how infatuated the mother is about that pert and headstrong boy who gives himself the airs of a lord on his blood - horse , and for whom our society is not good enough , and who would marry an odious painted actress off a booth , where very likely he wants to rant himself . If dear good Mr. Pendennis had been alive this scandal would never have happened . "
77970	77980	77981	77981	he	2354	" The - - coward insulted me , sir , "
78208	78233	78203	78203	he	1069	" arter arternoon school , which the bell was a - ringing : and Mr. Wapshot he came out in his Master 's gownd . "
78362	78369	78370	78370	he	845	" when was next killing day ? "
78540	78559	78534	78534	his	1067	" how dared he bring such an unchristian message as a challenge to a boy of his school ? "
78625	78640	78641	78642	Mr. Foker	801	" And so he sent you with the answer - did he , sir ? "
78656	78671	78641	78642	Mr. Foker	801	" If he had accepted this wicked challenge , I should have flogged him , "
78687	78699	78678	78679	Mr. Foker	801	" and I should like very much to flog you too . "
78700	78712	78714	78714	Pen	799	" Uncommon kind of you , sir , I 'm sure , "
78718	78734	78735	78735	he	4471	" I told my principal that I did n't think the other man would fight , "
78744	78776	78735	78735	he	4471	" He prefers being flogged to fighting , sir , I dare say . May I offer you any refreshment , Mr. ? I have n't the advantage of your name . "
78777	78799	78801	78802	the other	14365	" My name is Wapshot , sir , and I am Master of the Grammar School of this town , sir , "
78804	78828	78801	78802	the other	14365	" and I want no refreshment , sir , I thank you , and have no desire to make your acquaintance , sir . "
78829	78842	78844	78845	Mr. Foker	801	" I did n't seek yours , sir , I 'm sure , "
78847	78881	78844	78845	Mr. Foker	801	" In affairs of this sort , you see , I think it is a pity that the clergy should be called in , but there 's no accounting for tastes , sir . "
78882	78905	78907	78908	the Schoolmaster	14359	" I think it 's a pity that boys should talk about committing murder , sir , as lightly as you do , "
78910	78921	78907	78908	the Schoolmaster	14359	" and if I had you in my school - - "
78922	78934	78935	78936	Mr. Foker	801	" I dare say you would teach me better , sir , "
78943	79025	78935	78936	Mr. Foker	801	" Thank you , sir . I 've finished my education , sir , and ai n't a - going back to school , sir - when I do , I 'll remember your kind offer , sir . John , show this gentleman downstairs - and , of course , as Mr. Hobnell likes being thrashed , we can have no objection , sir , and we shall be very happy to accommodate him , whenever he comes our way . "
79325	79335	79344	79344	he	2890	" Vous allez trop vite , my good sir , "
79385	79415	79344	79344	he	2890	" between men of the world I do n't say ; but between two schoolboys , this sort of thing is ridiculous , my dear boy - perfectly ridiculous . "
79416	79427	79435	79435	her	697	" It is extremely wicked , and unlike my son , "
79457	79485	79447	79447	Pen	799	" Women , dear mother , do n't understand these matters - I put myself into Foker 's hands - I had no other course to pursue . "
79542	79556	79557	79557	she	697	" I have a great mind not to let him go at all , "
79664	79678	79679	79680	the Major	2155	" Mr. Foker knows the very best young men now at the University , "
79683	79846	79679	79680	the Major	2155	" and Pen will form acquaintances there who will be of the greatest advantage through life to him . The young Marquis of Plinlimmon is there , eldest son of the Duke of Saint David 's - Lord Magnus Charters is there , Lord Runnymede 's son , and a first cousin of Mr. Foker Lady Runnymede , my dear , was Lady Agatha Milton , you of course remember ; Lady Agnes will certainly invite him to Logwood ; and far from being alarmed at his intimacy with her son , who is a singular and humorous , but most prudent and amiable young man , to whom , I am sure , we are under every obligation for his admirable conduct in the affair of the Fotheringay marriage , I look upon it as one of the very luckiest things which could have happened to Pen , that he should have formed an intimacy with this most amusing young gentleman . "
80563	80571	80573	80574	the Major	2155	" Gad , I wish I could , "
80583	80595	80573	80574	the Major	2155	" The boy begins to sleep well , depend upon that . "
82254	82261	82262	82262	she	790	" Mong cure a boco souffare , "
82277	82286	82287	82287	she	790	" It est more en Espang , Madame , "
82480	82489	82490	82490	she	697	" Etre soul au monde est bien ouneeyoung , "
82515	82576	82490	82490	she	697	" Depend upon it when Master Pendennis goes to College , his Ma will find herself very lonely . She is quite young yet . - You would n't suppose her to be five - and - twenty . Monsieur le Cury , song cure est touchy - j'ang suis sure - Je conny cela biang - Ally Monsieur Smirke . "
83551	83557	83559	83560	Mrs. Pybus	715	" It is all settled , "
83565	83583	83559	83560	Mrs. Pybus	715	" the boy is to go to College , and then the widow is to console herself . "
83584	83601	83603	83604	Mrs. Speers	1087	" He 's been there every day , in the most open manner , my dear , "
83606	83618	83620	83621	Mrs. Wapshot	728	" Enough to make poor Mr. Pendennis turn in his grave , "
83623	83633	83620	83621	Mrs. Wapshot	728	" She never liked him , that we know , "
83639	83661	83620	83621	Mrs. Wapshot	728	" Married him for his money . Everybody knows that : was a penniless hanger - on of Lady Pontypool 's , "
83667	83690	83620	83621	Mrs. Wapshot	728	" It 's rather too open , though , to encourage a lover under pretence of having a tutor for your son , "
83696	83704	83705	83706	some one	3625	" Hush ! here comes Mrs. Portman , "
83972	83990	83993	83994	the Doctor	13989	" That milksop of a creature pretend to be worthy of such a woman as Mrs. Pendennis , "
83996	84003	83993	83994	the Doctor	13989	" where will impudence stop next ! "
84004	84014	84015	84016	Mrs. Portman	755	" She is much too old for Mr. Smirke , "
84019	84032	84015	84016	Mrs. Portman	755	" why , poor dear Mrs. Pendennis might be his mother almost . "
84033	84044	84046	84047	the Rector	4349	" You always choose the most charitable reason , Betsy , "
84049	84066	84046	84047	the Rector	4349	" A matron with a son grown up - she would never think of marrying again . "
84067	84086	84087	84087	You	755	" You only think men should marry again , Doctor Portman , answered his lady , bridling up . "
84092	84097	84087	84087	You	755	" said the Doctor , "
84146	84147	84136	84137	my Ghost	4731	" "
84158	84271	84152	84153	a clergyman	4640	" the lady answered , with a ready whimper : but these little breezes used to pass very rapidly over the surface of the Doctor 's domestic bliss ; and were followed by a great calm and sunshine . The Doctor adopted a plan for soothing Mrs. Portman 's ruffled countenance , which has a great effect when it is tried between a worthy couple who are sincerely fond of one another ; and which , I think , becomes ' John Anderson ' at three - score , just as much as it used to do when he was a black - haired young Jo of five - and - twenty . "
84283	84288	84281	84281	John	1090	" Mrs Portman asked . "
84298	84303	84281	84281	John	1090	" replied the Rector , "
84365	84366	84360	84361	that fool	4738	" "
84384	84389	84377	84377	I	0	" interposed Mrs. Portman . "
84402	84410	84394	84394	you	0	" the Doctor answered with a laugh . "
84492	84550	84486	84486	Smirke	759	" here the Doctor 's face assumed for one moment a comical expression , which Mrs. Portman did not perceive for she was looking out of the drawing - room window , and wondering what Mrs. Pybus could want cheapening fowls again in the market , when she had bad poultry from Livermore 's two days before - "
84585	84586	84574	84574	I	0	" "
84602	84609	84598	84598	I	0	" answered the Rector 's lady . "
84696	84697	84693	84694	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" "
84707	84715	84700	84700	you	0	" asked the Doctor 's wife . - "
84736	84737	84733	84734	that man	2528	" "
84751	84756	84740	84740	I	0	" the Doctor answered . "
84807	84980	84797	84797	I	0	" And so saying the Doctor went away to his study , and Mrs. Portman seeing that the day was a remarkably fine one , thought she would take advantage of the weather and pay a few visits . The Doctor looking out of his study window saw the wife of his bosom presently issue forth , attired in her best . She crossed the Market - place , saluting the market - women right and left , and giving a glance at the grocery and general emporium at the corner : then entering London Street formerly Hog Lane , she stopped for a minute at Madame Fribsby 's window , and looking at the fashions which hung up there , - seemed hesitating whether she should enter ; but she passed on and never stopped again until she came to Mrs. Pybus 's little green gate and garden , through which she went to that lady 's cottage . There , of course , her husband lost sight of Mrs. Portman . "
84991	84996	84797	84797	I	0	" he said inwardly - "
85041	85207	85031	85031	I	0	" Having a sermon to compose , the Doctor sat down to that work , and was so engaged in the composition , that he had not concluded it until near five o'clock in the afternoon : when he stepped over to Mr. Smirke 's lodgings , to put his hospitable intentions , regarding that gentleman , into effect . He reached Madame Fribsby 's door , just as the Curate issued from it . Mr. Smirke was magnificently dressed , and as he turned out his toes , he showed a pair of elegant open - worked silk stockings and glossy pumps . His white cravat was arranged in a splendid stiff tie , and his gold shirt studs shone on his spotless linen . His hair was curled round his fair temples . Had he borrowed Madame Fribsby 's irons to give that curly grace ? His white cambric pocket - handkerchief was scented with the most delicious eau - de - Cologne . "
85212	85219	85031	85031	I	0	" - cried the Doctor . - "
85234	85235	85225	85225	I	0	" "
85246	85436	85236	85236	I	0	" said Mr. Smirke , blushing faintly and whisking the scented pocket - handkerchief , and his pony being in waiting , he mounted and rode away simpering down the street . No accident befell him that day , and he arrived with his tie in the very best order at Mrs. Pendennis 's house . CHAPTER XVII Which concludes the first Part of this History The Curate had gone on his daily errand to Fairoaks , and was upstairs in Pens study pretending to read with his pupil , in the early part of that very afternoon when Mrs. Portman , after transacting business with Mrs. Pybus , had found the weather so exceedingly fine that she pursued her walk as far as Fairoaks , in order to pay a visit to her dear friend there . In the course of their conversation , the Rector 's lady told Mrs. Pendennis and the Major a very great secret about the Curate , Mr. Smirke , which was no less than that he had an attachment , a very old attachment , which he had long kept quite private . "
85450	85465	85447	85447	his	759	" asked Mrs. Pendennis , with a superb air but rather an inward alarm . "
85471	85477	85496	85496	Myra	1061	" the other lady answered , "
85535	85536	85532	85532	you	4765	" "
85540	85545	85538	85538	I	0	" cried Mrs. Pendennis ; "
85577	85578	85569	85569	anybody	14115	" "
85591	85607	85569	85569	anybody	14115	" the Major said , laying down the newspaper and the double eye - glass . "
85617	85622	85623	85623	I	0	" Helen continued indignantly . "
85633	85638	85623	85623	I	0	" Mrs. Portman said . "
85740	85831	85733	85733	you	13863	" Mrs. Pendennis said , with perfect sincerity , that she was exceedingly glad to hear the news : and hoped Mr. Smirke , who was a very kind and amiable man , would have a deserving wife : and when her visitor went away , Helen and her brother talked of the matter with great satisfaction , the kind lady rebuking herself for her haughty behaviour to Mr. Smirke , whom she had avoided of late , instead of being grateful to him for his constant attention to Arthur . "
85839	85844	85733	85733	you	13863	" the Major said , "
85906	86354	85898	85898	you	4778	" But Helen did not think so : and now that Arthur was going away , and she bethought her how very polite Mr. Smirke had been ; how he had gone on messages for her ; how he had brought books and copied music ; how he had taught Laura so many things , and given her so many kind presents , her heart smote her on account of her ingratitude towards the Curate ; - so much so , that when he came down from study with Pen , and was hankering about the hall previous to his departure , she went out and shook hands with him with rather a blushing face , and begged him to come into her drawing - room , where she said they now never saw him . And as there was to be rather a good dinner that day , she invited Mr. Smirke to partake of it ; and we may be sure that he was too happy to accept such a delightful summons . Eased , by the above report , of all her former doubts and misgivings regarding the Curate , Helen was exceedingly kind and gracious to Mr. Smirke during dinner , redoubling her attentions , perhaps , because Major Pendennis was very high and reserved with his nephew 's tutor . When Pendennis asked Smirke to drink wine , he addressed him as if he was a Sovereign speaking to a petty retainer , in a manner so condescending , that even Pen laughed at it , although quite ready , for his part , to be as conceited as most young men are . But Smirke did not care for the impertinences of the Major so long as he had his hostess 's kind behaviour ; and he passed a delightful time by her side at table , exerting all his powers of conversation to please her , talking in a manner both clerical and worldly , about the Fancy Bazaar , and the Great Missionary Meeting , about the last new novel , and the Bishop 's excellent sermon about the fashionable parties in London , an account of which he read in the newspapers - in fine , he neglected no art , by which a College divine who has both sprightly and serious talents , a taste for the genteel , an irreproachable conduct , and a susceptible heart , will try and make himself agreeable to the person on whom he has fixed his affections . Major Pendennis came yawning out of the dining - room very soon after his sister and little Laura had left the apartment . "
86369	86374	86375	86375	He	2528	" the Major said . "
86390	86396	86381	86381	Arthur	697	" Mrs. Pendennis said , - "
86411	86412	86400	86402	the Miss Thompson	875	" "
86424	86429	86416	86417	the fellow	15961	" said the Major . "
86434	86442	86416	86417	the fellow	15961	" asked Mrs. Pendennis quite innocently , - "
86447	86448	86444	86445	Myra Portman	757	" "
86458	86467	86450	86451	Helen Pendennis	673	" answered her brother - in - law . "
86473	86488	86489	86489	His	2528	" Helen said , who knew perfectly well that such had been the case . "
86508	87095	86500	86500	Arthur	697	" Now Arthur , flushed with a good deal of pride at the privilege of having the keys of the cellar , and remembering that a very few more dinners would probably take place which he and his dear friend Smirke could share , had brought up a liberal supply of claret for the company 's drinking , and when the elders with little Laura left him , he and the Curate began to pass the wine very freely . One bottle speedily yielded up the ghost , another shed more than half its blood , before the two topers had been much more than half an hour together - Pen , with a hollow laugh and voice , had drunk off one bumper to the falsehood of women , and had said sardonically , that wine at any rate was a mistress who never deceived , and was sure to give a man a welcome . Smirke gently said that he knew for his part some women who were all truth and tenderness ; and casting up his eyes towards the ceiling , and heaving a sigh as if evoking some being dear and unmentionable , he took up his glass and drained it , and the rosy liquor began to suffuse his face . Pen trolled over some verses he had been making that morning , in which he informed himself that the woman who had slighted his passion could not be worthy to win it : that he was awaking from love 's mad fever , and , of course , under these circumstances , proceeded to leave her , and to quit a heartless deceiver : that a name which had one day been famous in the land , might again be heard in it : and , that though he never should be the happy and careless boy he was but a few months since , or his heart be what it had been ere passion had filled it and grief had well - nigh killed it ; that though to him personally death was as welcome as life , and that he would not hesitate to part with the latter , but for the love of one kind being whose happiness depended on his own , - yet he hoped to show he was a man worthy of his race , and that one day the false one should be brought to know how great was the treasure and noble the heart which she had flung away . Pen , we say , who was a very excitable person , rolled out these verses in his rich sweet voice , which trembled with emotion whilst our young poet spoke . He had a trick of blushing when in this excited state , and his large and honest grey eyes also exhibited proofs of a sensibility so genuine , hearty , and manly , that Miss Costigan , if she had a heart , must needs have softened towards him ; and very likely she was , as he said , altogether unworthy of the affection which he lavished upon her . The sentimental Smirke was caught by the emotion which agitated his young friend . He grasped Pen 's hand over the dessert dishes and wine - glasses . He said the verses were beautiful : that Pen was a poet , a great poet , and likely by Heaven 's permission to run a great career in the world . "
87104	87108	87102	87102	Arthur	697	" he cried ; "
87212	87230	87231	87231	I	0	" Pen swore he would : with another shake of the hand across the glasses and apricots . "
87245	87249	87243	87243	Smirke	759	" he said . "
87268	87269	87262	87262	You	697	" "
87277	87303	87304	87306	My best friend	4785	" said Smirke , looking through his spectacles ; and his heart began to beat so that he thought Pen must almost hear it throbbing . "
87313	87317	87304	87306	My best friend	4785	" Pen said . "
87325	87384	87322	87323	old boy	14754	" and he drank up the last glass of the second bottle of the famous wine which his father had laid in , which his uncle had bought , which Lord Levant had imported , and which now , like a slave indifferent , was ministering pleasure to its present owner , and giving its young master delectation . "
87394	87398	87391	87392	old boy	14754	" Pen said , "
87489	87556	87557	87557	You	1096	" And Mr. Pen began to sing the drinking song out of Der Freischuetz . The dining - room windows were open , and his mother was softly pacing on the lawn outside , while little Laura was looking at the sunset . The sweet fresh notes of the boy 's voice came to the widow . It cheered her kind heart to hear him sing . "
87568	87574	87610	87610	I	0	" Mr. Smirke said softly - "
87580	87581	87578	87578	yourself	1096	" "
87584	87588	87589	87589	women	14676	" said Pen , "
87680	87681	87675	87675	you	1096	" "
87684	87709	87675	87675	you	1096	" said Smirke - and his beautiful cambric shirt front and glistening studs heaved with the emotion which agitated his gentle and suffering bosom . "
87716	87724	87675	87675	you	1096	" Pen cried , growing very hilarious ; "
87767	87768	87764	87765	Mrs. Smirke	1092	" "
87774	87783	87770	87770	you	0	" Smirke said , all of a tremble . "
87792	87793	87785	87785	you	0	" "
87822	87877	87878	87879	That boy	14258	" Smirke convulsively gulped down his glass of wine , and Pen waved his over his head , cheering so as to make his mother and Laura wonder on the lawn , and his uncle , who was dozing over the paper in the drawing - room , start , and say to himself , "
87885	87892	87878	87879	That boy	14258	" Smirke put down the glass . "
87898	87905	87893	87893	I	0	" gasped out the blushing Curate . "
87918	87919	87911	87911	you	697	" "
87947	87948	87939	87939	I	0	" "
87953	87966	87951	87951	Arthur	697	" groaned the Curate again , and nodded his head , speechless . "
87991	88007	87984	87984	you	697	" Pen continued - the third bottle evidently beginning to act upon the young gentleman . "
88014	88025	88011	88012	Miss Portman	757	" the other said , in a voice of agony . "
88061	88062	88063	88063	It	4804	" "
88074	88101	88072	88072	Pen	799	" the Curate cried , looking up at his friend , and then guiltily casting his eyes down into his plate . Pen burst out laughing . "
88123	88131	88132	88133	O Pen	799	" The Curate could contain no more . "
88135	88139	88132	88133	O Pen	799	" he cried , "
88238	88239	88230	88231	Charles Smirke	1100	" "
88253	88275	88245	88245	you	14754	" Pen said , whose liking , however , for his tutor was not by any means of the filial kind . "
88279	88284	88245	88245	you	14754	" rushed on Smirke , "
88381	88382	88374	88374	you	4815	" "
88401	88410	88411	88411	Arthur	697	" cried out Pen , in a puzzle . "
88415	88421	88422	88422	you	697	" exclaimed the other wildly ; "
88470	88471	88472	88473	My mother	2288	" "
88475	88488	88472	88473	My mother	2288	" cried out Arthur , jumping up and sober in a minute . "
88512	88513	88501	88501	she	2288	" "
88521	88553	88515	88515	you	1100	" cried Smirke piteously , and alluding , of course , to the elderly subject of Pen 's own passion . The lad felt the hint , and blushed quite red . "
88562	88566	88560	88560	Smirke	1100	" he said , "
88600	88601	88591	88591	me	0	" "
88610	88629	88604	88604	you	1100	" the Curate interposed sadly , cowering as he felt that his sentence was about to be read . "
88632	88636	88604	88604	you	1100	" said Arthur . "
88696	88697	88676	88676	I	0	" "
88701	88732	88676	88676	I	0	" the Curate began to cry with clasped hands , and a scared face , but Arthur gave another stamp with his foot and began to pull at the bell . "
88753	88841	88750	88750	you	1100	" he said with a majestic air ; and the old butler entering at the summons , Arthur bade him to serve that refreshment . John said he had just carried coffee into the drawing - room , where his uncle was asking for Master Arthur , and the old man gave a glance of wonder at the three empty claret - bottles . Smirke said he thought he 'd - he 'd rather not go into the drawing - room , on which Arthur haughtily said , "
88846	89019	89020	89020	I	0	" and called for Mr. Smirke 's horse to be brought round . The poor fellow said he knew the way to the stable and would get his pony himself , and he went into the hall and sadly put on his coat and hat . Pen followed him out uncovered . Helen was still walking up and down the soft lawn as the sun was setting , and the Curate took off his hat and bowed by way of farewell , and passed on to the door leading to the stable court , by which the pair disappeared . Smirke knew the way to the stable , as he said , well enough . He fumbled at the girths of the saddle , which Pen fastened for him , and put on the bridle and led the pony into the yard . The boy was touched by the grief which appeared in the other 's face as he mounted . Pen held out his hand , and Smirke wrung it silently , "
89025	89033	89023	89023	Smirke	759	" he said in an agitated voice , "
89077	89181	89073	89073	God	1867	" Smirke nodded his head silently , and rode out of the lodge - gate : and Pen looked after him for a couple of minutes , until he disappeared down the road , and the clatter of the pony 's hoofs died away . Helen was still lingering on the lawn waiting until the boy came back - she put his hair off his forehead and kissed it fondly . She was afraid he had been drinking too much wine . Why had Mr. Smirke gone away without any tea ? He looked at her with a kind humour beaming in his eyes "
89186	89246	89182	89182	Smirke	759	" he said with a laugh . For a long while Hele had not seen the boy looking so cheerful . He put his arm round her waist , and walked her up and down the walk in front of the house . Laura began to drub on the drawing - room window and nod and laugh from it . "
89254	89260	89250	89250	you	4832	" cried on Major Pendennis , "
89268	89325	89250	89250	you	4832	" When Laura was gone to bed , Pen , who was big with his secret , burst out with it , and described the dismal but ludicrous scene which had occurred . Helen heard of it with many blushes , which became her pale face very well , and a perplexity which Arthur roguishly enjoyed . "
89332	89342	89250	89250	you	4832	" Major Pendennis said as he took his candle , "
89352	90117	90118	90118	Costigan	847	" Pen and his mother had a long talk that night , full of love , confidence , and laughter , and the boy somehow slept more soundly and woke up more easily than he had done for many months before . Before the great Mr. Dolphin quitted Chatteris , he not only made an advantageous engagement with Miss Fotheringay , but he liberally left with her a sum of money to pay off any debts which the little family might have contracted during their stay in the place , and which , mainly through the lady 's own economy and management , were not considerable . The small account with the spirit merchant , which Major Pendennis had settled , was the chief of Captain Costigan 's debts , and though the Captain at one time talked about repaying every farthing of the money , it never appears that he executed his menace , nor did the laws of honour in the least call upon him to accomplish that threat . When Miss Costigan had seen all the outstanding bills paid to the uttermost shilling , she handed over the balance to her father , who broke out into hospitalities to all his friends , gave the little Creeds more apples and gingerbread than he had ever bestowed upon them , so that the widow Creed ever after held the memory of her lodger in veneration , and the young ones wept bitterly when he went away ; and in a word managed the money so cleverly that it was entirely expended before many days , and that he was compelled to draw upon Mr. Dolphin for a sum to pay for travelling expenses when the time of their departure arrived . There was held at an inn in that county town a weekly meeting of a festive , almost a riotous character , of a society of gentlemen who called themselves the Buccaneers . Some of the choice spirits of Chatteris belonged to this cheerful club . Graves , the apothecary than whom a better fellow never put a pipe in his mouth and smoked it , Smart , the talented and humorous portrait - painter of High Street , Croker , an excellent auctioneer , and the uncompromising Hicks , the able Editor for twenty - three years of the County Chronicle and Chatteris Champion , were amongst the crew of the Buccaneers , whom also Bingley , the manager , liked to join of a Saturday evening , whenever he received permission from his lady . Costigan had been also an occasional Buccaneer . But a want of punctuality of payments had of late somewhat excluded him from the Society , where he was subject to disagreeable remarks from the landlord , who said that a Buccaneer who did n't pay his shot was utterly unworthy to be a Marine Bandit . But when it became known to the ' Ears , as the Clubbists called themselves familiarly , that Miss Fotheringay had made a splendid engagement , a great revolution of feeling took place in the Club regarding Captain Costigan . Solly , mine host of the Grapes and I need not say , as worthy a fellow as ever stood behind a bar , told the gents in the Buccaneers ' room one night how noble the Captain had behaved ; having been round and paid off all his ticks in Chatteris , including his score of three pound fourteen here - and pronounced that Cos was a good feller , a gentleman at bottom , and he , Solly , had always said so , and finally worked upon the feelings of the Buccaneers to give the Captain a dinner . The banquet took place on the last night of Costigan 's stay at Chatteris , and was served in Solly 's accustomed manner . As good a plain dinner of old English fare as ever smoked on a table was prepared by Mrs. Solly ; and about eighteen gentlemen sate down to the festive board . Mr. Jubber the eminent draper of High Street was in the Chair , having the distinguished guest of the Club on his right . The able and consistent Hicks officiated as croupier on the occasion ; most of the gentlemen of the Club were present , and H. Foker , Esq . , and Spavin , Esq . , friends of Captain Costigan , were also participators in the entertainment . The cloth having been drawn , the Chairman said , "
90128	90172	90118	90118	Costigan	847	" but the Captain preferring punch , that liquor was voted by acclamation : and ' Non Nobis ' having been sung in admirable style by Messrs. Bingley , Hicks , and Bullby of the Cathedral choir , than whom a more jovial spirit "
90182	90731	90732	90732	Ye	4837	" , the Chairman gave the health of the ' King ! ' which was drunk with the loyalty of Chatteris men , and then without further circumlocution proposed their friend ' Captain Costigan . ' After the enthusiastic cheering which rang through old Chatteris had subsided , Captain Costigan rose in reply , and made a speech of twenty minutes , in which he was repeatedly overcome by his emotions . The gallant Captain said he must be pardoned for incoherence , if his heart was too full to speak . He was quitting a city celebrated for its antiquitee , its hospitalitee , the beautee of its women , the manly fidelitee , generositee , and jovialitee of its men . Cheers . He was going from that ancient and venerable city , of which while Mimoree held her sayt , he should never think without the fondest emotion , to a methrawpolis where the talents of his daughther were about to have full play , and where he would watch over her like a guardian angel . He should never forget that it was at Chatteris she had acquired the skill which she was about to exercise in another sphere , and in her name and his own Jack Costigan thanked and blessed them . The gallant officer 's speech was received with tremendous cheers . Mr. Hicks , Croupier , in a brilliant and energetic manner , proposed Miss Fotheringay 's health . Captain Costigan returned thanks in a speech full of feeling and eloquence . Mr. Jubber proposed the Drama and the Chatteris Theatre , and Mr. Bingley was about to rise but was prevented by Captain Costigan , who , as long connected with the Chatteris Theatre and on behalf of his daughter , thanked the company . He informed them that he had been in garrison , at Gibraltar , and at Malta , and had been at the taking of Flushing . The Duke of York was a patron of the Drama ; he had the honour of dining with His Royal Highness and the Duke of Kent many times ; and the former had justly been named the friend of the soldier . Cheers . The Army was then proposed , and Captain Costigan returned thanks . In the course of the night he sang his well - known songs , ' The Deserter , ' ' The Shan Van Voght , ' ' The Little Pig under the Bed , ' and ' The Vale of Avoca . ' The evening was a great triumph for him - it ended . All triumphs and all evenings end . And the next day , Miss Costigan having taken leave of all her friends , having been reconciled to Miss Rouncy , to whom she left a necklace and a white satin gown - the next day , he and Miss Costigan had places in the Competitor coach rolling by the gates of Fairoaks Lodge - and Pendennis never saw them . Tom Smith , the coachman , pointed out Fairoaks to Mr. Costigan , who sate on the box smelling of rum - and - water - and the Captain said it was a poor place - and added , "
90744	92426	90741	90741	me	0	" - which Tom said he should like very much to see . They were gone and Pen had never seen them ! He only knew of their departure by its announcement in the county paper the next day : and straight galloped over to Chatteris to hear the truth of this news . They were gone indeed . A card of ' Lodgings to let ' was placed in the dear little familiar window . He rushed up into the room and viewed it over . He sate ever so long in the old window - seat looking into the Dean 's garden : whence he and Emily had so often looked out together . He walked , with a sort of terror , into her little empty bedroom . It was swept out and prepared for new - comers . The glass which had reflected her fair face was shining ready for her successor . The curtains lay square folded on the little bed : he flung himself down and buried his head on the vacant pillow . Laura had netted a purse into which his mother had put some sovereigns , and Pen had found it on his dressing - table that very morning . He gave one to the little servant who had been used to wait upon the Costigans , and another to the children , because they said they were very fond of her . It was but a few months back , yet what years ago it seemed since he had first entered that room ! He felt that it was all done . The very missing her at the coach had something fatal in it . Blank , weary , utterly wretched and lonely the poor lad felt . His mother saw She was gone by his look when he came home . He was eager to fly too now , as were other folks round about Chatteris . Poor Smirke wanted to go away from the sight of the syren widow . Foker began to think he had had enough of Baymouth , and that a few supper - parties at Saint Boniface would not be unpleasant . And Major Pendennis longed to be off , and have a little pheasant - shooting at Stillbrook , and get rid of all annoyances and tracasseries of the village . The widow and Laura nervously set about the preparation for Pen 's kit , and filled trunks with his books and linen . Helen wrote cards with the name of Arthur Pendennis , Esq . , which were duly nailed on the boxes ; and at which both she and Laura looked with tearful wistful eyes . It was not until long , long after he was gone , that Pen remembered how constant and tender the affection of these women had been , and how selfish his own conduct was . A night soon comes , when the mail , with echoing horn and blazing lamps , stops at the lodge - gate of Fairoaks , and Pen 's trunks and his uncle 's are placed on the roof of the carriage , into which the pair presently afterwards enter . Helen and Laura are standing by the evergreens of the shrubbery , their figures lighted up by the coach lamps ; the guard cries all right : in another instant the carriage whirls onward ; the lights disappear , and Helen 's heart and prayers go with them . Her sainted benedictions follow the departing boy . He has left the home - nest in which he has been chafing , and whither , after his very first flight , he returned bleeding and wounded ; he is eager to go forth again , and try his restless wings . How lonely the house looks without him ! The corded trunks and book - boxes are there in his empty study . Laura asks leave to come and sleep in Helen 's room : and when she has cried herself to sleep there , the mother goes softly into Pen 's vacant chamber , and kneels down by the bed on which the moon is shining , and there prays for her boy , as mothers only know how to plead . He knows that her pure blessings are following him , as he is carried miles away . CHAPTER XVIII Alma Mater Every man , however brief or inglorious may have been his academical career , must remember with kindness and tenderness the old university comrades and days . The young man 's life is just beginning : the boy 's leading - strings are cut , and he has all the novel delights and dignities of freedom . He has no idea of cares yet , or of bad health , or of roguery , or poverty , or to - morrow 's disappointment . The play has not been acted so often as to make him tired . Though the after drink , as we mechanically go on repeating it , is stale and bitter , how pure and brilliant was that first sparkling draught of pleasure ! - How the boy rushes at the cup , and with what a wild eagerness he drains it ! But old epicures who are cut off from the delights of the table , and are restricted to a poached egg and a glass of water , like to see people with good appetites ; and , as the next best thing to being amused at a pantomime one's - self is to see one 's children enjoy it , I hope there may be no degree of age or experience to which mortal may attain , when he shall become such a glum philosopher as not to be pleased by the sight of happy youth . Coming back a few weeks since from a brief visit to the old University of Oxbridge , where my friend Mr. Arthur Pendennis passed some period of his life , I made the journey in the railroad by the side of a young fellow at present a student of Saint Boniface . He had got an exeat somehow , and was bent on a day 's lark in London : he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close which was a great deal too soon for me , for I never was tired of listening to the honest young fellow 's jokes and cheery laughter ; and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab , so that he might get into town the quicker , and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there . Away the young lad went whirling , with joy lighting up his honest face ; and as for the reader 's humble servant , having but a small carpet - bag , I got up on the outside of the omnibus , and sate there very contentedly between a Jew - pedlar smoking bad cigars , and a gentleman 's servant taking care of a poodle - dog , until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes , when the coachman drove leisurely away . We were n't in a hurry to get to town . Neither one of us was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking Babylon , or thought of dining at the Club that night , or dancing at the Casino . Yet a few years more , and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager . There were no railroads made when Arthur Pendennis went to the famous University of Oxbridge ; but he drove thither in a well - appointed coach , filled inside and out with dons , gownsmen , young freshmen about to enter , and their guardians , who were conducting them to the university . A fat old gentleman , in grey stockings , from the City , who sate by Major Pendennis inside the coach , having his pale - faced son opposite , was frightened beyond measure when he heard that the coach had been driven for a couple of stages by young Mr. Foker , of Saint Boniface College , who was the friend of all men , including coachmen , and could drive as well as Tom Hicks himself . Pen sate on the roof , examining coach , passengers , and country with great delight and curiosity . His heart jumped with pleasure as the famous university came in view , and the magnificent prospect of venerable towers and pinnacles , tall elms and shining river , spread before him . Pen had passed a few days with his uncle at the Major 's lodgings , in Bury Street , before they set out for Oxbridge . Major Pendennis thought that the lad 's wardrobe wanted renewal ; and Arthur was by no means averse to any plan which was to bring him new coats and waistcoats . There was no end to the sacrifices which the self - denying uncle made in the youth 's behalf . London was awfully lonely . The Pall Mall pavement was deserted ; the very red jackets had gone out of town . There was scarce a face to be seen in the bow - windows of the clubs . The Major conducted his nephew into one or two of those desert mansions , and wrote down the lad 's name on the candidate - list of one of them ; and Arthur 's pleasure at this compliment on his guardian 's part was excessive . He read in the parchment volume his name and titles , as ' Arthur Pendennis , Esquire , of Fairoaks Lodge , - - shire and Saint Boniface College , Oxbridge ; proposed by Major Pendennis , and seconded by Viscount Colchicum , ' with a thrill of intense gratification . "
92448	92932	92445	92445	your	4839	" the guardian said . Pen longed for the three years to be over , and surveyed the stucco - halls , and vast libraries , and drawing - rooms as already his own property . The Major laughed slyly to see the pompous airs of the simple young fellow as he strutted out of the building . He and Foker drove down in the latter 's cab one day to the Grey Friars , and renewed acquaintance with some of their old comrades there . The boys came crowding up to the cab as it stood by the Grey Friars gates , where they were entering , and admired the chestnut horse , and the tights and livery and gravity of Stoopid , the tiger . The bell for afternoon - school rang as they were swaggering about the play - ground talking to their old cronies . The awful Doctor passed into school with his grammar in his hand . Foker slunk away uneasily at his presence , but Pen went up blushing , and shook the dignitary by the hand . He laughed as he thought that well - remembered Latin Grammar had boxed his ears many a time . He was generous , good - natured , and , in a word , perfectly conceited and satisfied with himself . Then they drove to the parental brew - house . Foker 's Entire is composed in an enormous pile of buildings , not far from the Grey Friars , and the name of that well - known firm is gilded upon innumerable public - house signs , tenanted by its vassals in the neighbourhood ; and the venerable junior partner and manager did honour to the young lord of the vats and his friend , and served them with silver flagons of brown - stout , so strong , that you would have thought , not only the young men , but the very horse Mr. Harry Foker drove , was affected by the potency of the drink , for he rushed home to the west - end of the town at a rapid pace , which endangered the pie - stalls and the women on the crossings , and brought the cab - steps into collision with the posts at the street corners , and caused Stoopid to swing fearfully on his board behind . The Major was quite pleased when Pen was with his young acquaintance ; listened to Mr. Foker 's artless stories with the greatest interest ; gave the two boys a fine dinner at a Covent Garden Coffee - house , whence they proceeded to the play ; but was above all happy when Mr. and Lady Agnes Foker , who happened to be in London , requested the pleasure of Major Pendennis and Mr. Arthur Pendennis 's company at dinner in Grosvenor Street . "
92944	92961	92445	92445	your	4839	" he said to Pen with an affectionate solemnity which befitted the importance of the occasion , "
93112	93446	93072	93072	He	845	" And the heroic martyr did actually sacrifice himself , as he said he would , on the day when the dinner took place , and old Mr. Foker , at the head of his table , made his usual joke about Foker 's Entire . We should all of us , I am sure , have liked to see the Major 's grin , when the worthy old gentleman made his time - honoured joke . Lady Agnes , who , wrapped up in Harry , was the fondest of mothers , and one of the most good - natured though not the wisest of women , received her son 's friend with great cordiality : and astonished Pen by accounts of the severe course of studies which her darling boy was pursuing , and which she feared might injure his dear health . Foker the elder burst into a horse - laugh at some of these speeches , and the heir of the house winked his eye very knowingly at his friend . And Lady Agnes then going through her son 's history from the earliest time , and recounting his miraculous sufferings in the measles and hooping - cough , his escape from drowning , the shocking tyrannies practised upon him at that horrid school , whither Mr. Foker would send him because he had been brought up there himself , and she never would forgive that disagreeable Doctor , no never - Lady Agnes , we say , having prattled away for an hour incessantly about her son , voted the two Messieurs Pendennis most agreeable men ; and when pheasants came with the second course , which the Major praised as the very finest birds he ever saw , her ladyship said they came from Logwood as the Major knew perfectly well , and hoped that they would both pay her a visit there - at Christmas , or when dear Harry was at home for the vacations . "
93455	93476	93072	93072	He	845	" Pendennis said to Arthur , as they were lighting their candles in Bury Street afterwards to go to bed . "
93686	94751	93684	93684	you	4847	" Pen wrote a droll account of his doings in London , and the play , and the visit to the old Friars , and the brewery , and the party at Mr. Foker 's , to his dearest mother , who was saying her prayers at home in the lonely house at Fairoaks , her heart full of love and tenderness unutterable for the boy : and she and Laura read that letter and those which followed , many , many times , and brooded over them as women do . It was the first step in life that Pen was making - Ah ! what a dangerous journey it is , and how the bravest may stumble and the strongest fail . Brother wayfarer ! may you have a kind arm to support yours on the path , and a friendly hand to succour those who fall beside you . May truth guide , mercy forgive at the end , and love accompany always . Without that lamp how blind the traveller would be , and how black and cheerless the journey ! So the coach drove up to that ancient and comfortable inn the Trencher , which stands in Main Street , Oxbridge , and Pen with delight and eagerness remarked , for the first time , gownsmen going about , chapel bells clinking bells in Oxbridge are ringing from morning - tide till even - song - towers and pinnacles rising calm and stately over the gables and antique house - roofs of the homely busy city . Previous communications had taken place between Dr. Portman on Pen 's part , and Mr. Buck , Tutor of Boniface , on whose side Pen was entered ; and as soon as Major Pendennis had arranged his personal appearance , so that it should make a satisfactory impression upon Pen 's tutor , the pair walked down Main Street , and passed the great gate and belfry - tower of Saint George 's College , and so came , as they were directed , to Saint Boniface : where again Pen 's heart began to beat as they entered at the wicket of the venerable ivy - mantled gate of the College . It is surmounted with an ancient dome almost covered with creepers , and adorned with the effigy of the Saint from whom the House takes its name , and many coats - of - arms of its royal and noble benefactors . The porter pointed out a queer old tower at the corner of the quadrangle , by which Mr. Buck 's rooms were approached , and the two gentlemen walked acrosse the square , the main features of which were at once and for ever stamped in Pen 's mind - the pretty fountain playing in the centre of the fair grass plats ; the tall chapel windows and buttresses rising to the right ; the hall with its tapering lantern and oriel window ; the lodge , from the doors of which the Master issued with rustling silks ; the lines of the surrounding rooms pleasantly broken by carved chimneys , grey turrets , and quaint gables - all these Mr. Pen 's eyes drank in with an eagerness which belongs to first impressions ; and Major Pendennis surveyed with that calmness which belongs to a gentleman who does not care for the picturesque , and whose eyes have been somewhat dimmed by the constant glare of the pavement of Pall Mall . Saint George 's is the great College of the University of Oxbridge , with its four vast quadrangles , and its beautiful hall and gardens , and the Georgians , as the men are called wear gowns of a peculiar cut , and give themselves no small airs of superiority over all other young men . Little Saint Boniface is but a petty hermitage in comparison of the huge consecrated pile alongside of which it lies . But considering its size it has always kept an excellent name in the university . Its ton is very good : the best families of certain counties have time out of mind sent up their young men to Saint Boniface : the college livings are remarkably good : the fellowships easy ; the Boniface men had had more than their fair share of university honours ; their boat was third upon the river ; their chapel - choir is not inferior to Saint George 's itself ; and the Boniface ale the best in Oxbridge . In the comfortable old wainscoted College - Hall , and round about Roubilliac 's statue of Saint Boniface who stands in an attitude of seraphic benediction over the uncommonly good cheer of the fellows ' table there are portraits of many most eminent Bonifacians . There is the learned Doctor Griddle , who suffered in Henry VIII . 's time , and Archbishop Bush who roasted him - there is Lord Chief Justice Hicks - the Duke of St. David 's , K.G. , Chancellor of the University and Member of this College - Sprott the Poet , of whose fame the college is justly proud - Doctor Blogg , the late master , and friend of Doctor Johnson , who visited him at Saint Boniface - and other lawyers , scholars , and divines , whose portraitures look from the walls , or whose coats - of - arms shine in emerald and ruby , gold and azure , in the tall windows of the refectory . The venerable cook of the college is one of the best artists in Oxbridge his son took the highest honours in the other University of Camford , and the wine in the fellows ' room has long been famed for its excellence and abundance . Into this certainly not the least snugly sheltered arbour amongst the groves of Academe , Pen now found his way , leaning on his uncle 's arm , and they speedily reached Mr. Buck 's rooms , and were conducted into the apartment of that courteous gentleman . He had received previous information from Dr. Portman regarding Pen , with respect to whose family , fortune , and personal merits the honest Doctor had spoken with no small enthusiasm . Indeed Portman had described Arthur to the tutor as "
94801	95927	95928	95930	Poor old Smirke	789	" Under such recommendations the tutor was , of course , most cordial to the young freshman and his guardian , invited the latter to dine in hall , where he would have the satisfaction of seeing his nephew wear his gown and eat his dinner for the first time , and requested the pair to take wine at his rooms after hall , and in consequence of the highly favourable report he had received of Mr. Arthur Pendennis , said , he should be happy to give him the best set of rooms to be had in college - a gentleman - pensioner 's set , indeed , which were just luckily vacant . So they parted until dinner - time , which was very near at hand , and Major Pendennis pronounced Mr. Buck to be uncommonly civil indeed . Indeed when a College Magnate takes the trouble to be polite , there is no man more splendidly courteous . Immersed in their books and excluded from the world by the gravity of their occupations , these reverend men assume a solemn magnificence of compliment in which they rustle and swell as in their grand robes of state . Those silks and brocades are not put on for all comers or every day . When the two gentlemen had taken leave of the tutor in his study , and had returned to Mr. Buck 's ante - room , or lecture - room , a very handsome apartment , turkey - carpeted , and hung with excellent prints and richly framed pictures , they found the tutor 's servant already in waiting there , accompanied by a man with a bag full of caps and a number of gowns , from which Pen might select a cap and gown for himself , and the servant , no doubt , would get a commission proportionable to the service done by him . Mr. Pen was all in a tremor of pleasure as the bustling tailor tried on a gown and pronounced that it was an excellent fit ; and then he put the pretty college cap on , in rather a dandified manner and somewhat on one side , as he had seen Fiddicombe , the youngest master at Grey Friars , wear it . And he inspected the entire costume with a great deal of satisfaction in one of the great gilt mirrors which ornamented Mr. Buck 's lecture - room : for some of these college divines are no more above looking - glasses than a lady is , and look to the set of their gowns and caps quite as anxiously as folks do of the lovelier sex . The Major smiled as he saw the boy dandifying himself in the glass : the old gentleman was not displeased with the appearance of the comely lad . Then Davis , the skip or attendant , led the way , keys in hand , across the quadrangle , the Major and Pen following him , the latter blushing , and pleased with his new academical habiliments , across the quadrangle to the rooms which were destined for the freshman ; and which were vacated by the retreat of the gentleman - pensioner , Mr. Spicer . The rooms were very comfortable , with large cross beams , high wainscots , and small windows in deep embrasures . Mr. Spicer 's furniture was there , and to be sold at a valuation , and Major Pendennis agreed on his nephew 's behalf to take the available part of it , laughingly however declining as , indeed , Pen did for his own part six sporting prints , and four groups of opera - dancers with gauze draperies , which formed the late occupant 's pictorial collection . Then they went to hall , where Pen sate down and ate his commons with his brother freshmen , and the Major took his place at the high - table along with the college dignitaries and other fathers or guardians of youth , who had come up with their sons to Oxbridge ; and after hall they went to Mr. Buck 's to take wine ; and after wine to chapel , where the Major sate with great gravity in the upper place , having a fine view of the Master in his carved throne or stall under the organ - loft , where that gentleman , the learned Doctor Donne , sate magnificent , with his great prayer - book before him , an image of statuesque piety and rigid devotion . All the young freshmen behaved with gravity and decorum , but Pen was shocked to see that atrocious little Foker , who came in very late , and half a dozen of his comrades in the gentlemen - pensioners ' seats , giggling and talking as if they had been in so many stalls at the Opera . But these circumstances , it must be remembered , took place some years back , when William the Fourth was king . Young men are much better behaved now , and besides , Saint Boniface was rather a fast college . Pen could hardly sleep at night in his bedroom at the Trencher : so anxious was he to begin his college life , and to get into his own apartments . What did he think about , as he lay tossing and awake ? Was it about his mother at home ; the pious soul whose life was bound up in his ? Yes , let us hope he thought of her a little . Was it about Miss Fotheringay , and his eternal passion , which had kept him awake so many nights , and created such wretchedness and such longing ? He had a trick of blushing , and if you had been in the room , and the candle had not been out , you might have seen the youth 's countenance redden more than once , as be broke out into passionate incoherent exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life . His uncle 's lessons had not been thrown away upon him ; the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now , and he saw her as she was . To think that he , Pendennis , had been enslaved by such a woman , and then jilted by her ! that he should have stooped so low , to be trampled on the mire ! that there was a time in his life , and that but a few months back , when he was willing to take Costigan for his father - in - law ! "
95932	95938	95928	95930	Poor old Smirke	789	" Pen presently laughed out - "
95965	98282	95953	95953	He	4863	" The Major , had he been awake , might have heard a score of such ejaculations uttered by Pen as he lay awake and restless through the first night of his residence at Oxbridge . It would , perhaps , have been better for a youth , the battle of whose life was going to begin on the morrow , to have passed the eve in a fferent sort of vigil : but the world had got hold of Pen in the shape of his selfish old Mentor : and those who have any interest in his character must have perceived ere now , that this lad was very weak as well as very impetuous , very vain as well as very frank , and if of a generous disposition , not a little selfish in the midst of his profuseness , and also rather fickle , as all eager pursuers of self - gratification are . The six months ' passion had aged him very considerably . There was an immense gulf between Pen the victim of love , and Pen the innocent boy of eighteen , sighing after it : and so Arthur Pendennis had all the experience and superiority , besides that command which afterwards conceit and imperiousness of disposition gave him over the young men with whom he now began to live . He and his uncle passed the morning with great satisfaction in making purchases for the better comfort of the apartments which the lad was about to occupy . Mr. Spicer 's china and glass was in a dreadfully dismantled condition , his lamps smashed , and his bookcases by no means so spacious as those shelves which would be requisite to receive the contents of the boxes which were lying in the hall at Fairoaks , and which were addressed to Arthur in the hand of poor Helen . The boxes arrived in a few days , that his mother had packed with so much care . Pen was touched as he read the superscriptions in the dear well - known hand , and he arranged in their proper places all the books , his old friends , and all the linen and table - cloths which Helen had selected from the family stock , and all the jam - pots which little Laura had bound in straw , and the hundred simple gifts of home . Pen had another Alma Mater now . But it is not all children who take to her kindly . CHAPTER XIX Pendennis of Boniface Our friend Pen was not sorry when his Mentor took leave of the young gentleman on the second day after the arrival of the pair in Oxbridge , and we may be sure that the Major on his part was very glad to have discharged his duty , and to have the duty over . More than three months of precious time had that martyr of a Major given up to his nephew - Was ever selfish man called upon to make a greater sacrifice ? Do you know many men or Majors who would do as much ? A man will lay down his head , or peril his life for his honour , but let us be shy how we ask him to give up his ease or his heart 's desire . Very few of us can bear that trial . Say , worthy reader , if thou hast peradventure a beard , wouldst thou do as much ? I will not say that a woman will not . They are used to it : we take care to accustom them to sacrifices but , my good sir , the amount of self - denial which you have probably exerted through life , when put down to your account elsewhere , will not probably swell the balance on the credit side much . Well , well , there is no use in speaking of such ugly matters , and you are too polite to use a vulgar to quoque . But I wish to state once for all that I greatly admire the Major for his conduct during the past quarter , and think that he has quite a right to be pleased at getting a holiday . Foker and Pen saw him off in the coach , and the former young gentleman gave particular orders to the coachman to take care of that gentleman inside . It pleased the elder Pendennis to have his nephew in the company of a young fellow who would introduce him to the best set of the university . The Major rushed off to London and thence to Cheltenham , from which Watering - place he descended upon some neighbouring great houses , whereof the families were not gone abroad , and where good shooting and company was to be had . A quarter of the space which custom has awarded to works styled the Serial Nature , has been assigned to the account of one passage in Pen 's career , and it is manifest that the whole of his adventures can not be treated at a similar length , unless some descendant of the chronicler of Pen 's history should take up the pen at his decease , and continue the narrative for the successors of the present generation of readers . We are not about to go through the young fellow 's academical career with , by any means , a similar minuteness . Alas , the life of such boys does not bear telling altogether . I wish it did . I ask you , does yours ? As long as what we call our honour is clear , I suppose your mind is pretty easy . Women are pure , but not men . Women are unselfish , but not men . And I would not wish to say of poor Arthur Pendennis that he was worse than his neighbours , only that his neighbours are bad for the most part . Let us have the candour to own as much at least . Can you point out ten spotless men of your acquaintance ? Mine is pretty large , but I ca n't find ten saints in the list . During the first term of Mr. Pen 's academical life , he attended classical and mathematical lectures with tolerable assiduity ; but discovering before very long time that he had little taste or genius for the pursuing of the exact sciences , and being perhaps rather annoyed that one or two very vulgar young men , who did not even use straps to their trousers so as to cover the abominably thick and coarse shoes and stockings which they wore , beat him completely in the lecture - room , he gave up his attendance at that course , and announced to his fond parent that he proposed to devote himself exclusively to the cultivation of Greek and Roman Literature . Mrs. Pendennis was , for her part , quite satisfied that her darling boy should pursue that branch of learning for which he had the greatest inclination ; and only besought him not to ruin his health by too much study , for she had heard the most melancholy stories of young students who , by over - fatigue , had brought on brain - fevers and perished untimely in the midst of their university career . And Pen 's health , which was always delicate , was to be regarded , as she justly said , beyond all considerations or vain honours . Pen , although not aware of any lurking disease which was likely to end his life , yet kindly promised his mamma not to sit up reading too late of nights , and stuck to his word in this respect with a great deal more tenacity of resolution than he exhibited upon some other occasions , when perhaps he was a little remiss . Presently he began too to find that he learned little good in the classical lecture . His fellow - students there were too dull , as in mathematics they were too learned for him . Mr. Buck , the tutor , was no better a scholar than many a fifth - form boy at Grey Friars ; might have some stupid humdrum notions about the metre and grammatical construction of a passage of Aeschylus or Aristophanes , but had no more notion of the poetry than Mrs. Binge , his bed - maker ; and Pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play , which he could read in a tenth part of the time which they gave to it . After all , private reading , as he began to perceive , was the only study which was really profitable to a man ; and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more , and in public a great deal less . That excellent woman knew no more about Homer than she did about Algebra , but she was quite contented with Pen 's arrangements regarding his course of studies , and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited . Pen did not come home until after Christmas , a little to the fond mother 's disappointment , and Laura 's , who was longing for him to make a fine snow fortification , such as he had made three winters before . But he was invited to Logwood , Lady Agnes Foker 's , where there were private theatricals , and a gay Christmas party of very fine folks , some of them whom Major Pendennis would on no account have his nephew neglect . However , he stayed at home for the last three weeks of the vacation , and Laura had the opportunity of remarking what a quantity of fine new clothes he brought with him , and his mother admired his improved appearance and manly and decided tone . He did not come home at Easter ; but when he arrived for the long vacation , he brought more smart clothes ; appearing in the morning in wonderful shooting jackets , with remarkable buttons ; and in the evening in gorgeous velvet waistcoats , with richly - embroidered cravats , and curious linen . And as she pried about his room , she saw , oh , such a beautiful dressing - case , with silver mountings , and a quantity of lovely rings and jewellery . And he had a new French watch and gold chain , in place of the big old chronometer , with its bunch of jingling seals , which had hung from the fob of John Pendennis , and by the second - hand of which the defunct doctor had felt many a patient 's pulse in his time . It was but a few months back Pen had longed for this watch , which he thought the most splendid and august timepiece in the world ; and just before he went to college , Helen had taken it out of her trinket - box where it had remained unwound since the death of her husband and given it to Pen with a solemn and appropriate little speech respecting his father 's virtues and the proper use of time . This portly and valuable chronometer Pen now pronounced to be out of date , and , indeed , made some comparisons between it and a warming - pan , which Laura thought disrespectful , and he left the watch in a drawer , in the company of soiled primrose gloves , cravats which had gone out of favour , and of that other school watch which has once before been mentioned in this history . Our old friend , Rebecca , Pen pronounced to be no long up to his weight , and swapped her away for another and more powerful horse , for which he had to pay rather a heavy figure . Mr. Pendennis gave the boy the money for the new horse ; and Laura cried when Rebecca was fetched away . Also Pen brought a large box of cigars branded Colorados , Afrancesados , Telescopios , Fudson Oxford Street , or by some such strange titles , and began to consume these not only about the stables and green - houses , where they were very good for Helen 's plants , but in his own study , of which practice his mother did not at first approve . But he was at work upon a prize - poem , he said , and could not compose without his cigar , and quoted the late lamented it Lord Byron 's lines in favour of the custom of smoking . As he was smoking to such good purpose , his mother could not of course refuse permission : in fact , the good soul coming into the room one day in the midst of Pen 's labours he was consulting a novel which had recently appeared , for the cultivation of the light literature of his own country as well as of foreign nations became every student - Helen , we say , coming into the room and finding Pen on the sofa at this work , rather than disturb him went for a light - box and his cigar - case to his bedroom which was adjacent , and actually put the cigar into his mouth and lighted the match at which he kindled it . Pen laughed , and kissed his mother 's hand as it hung fondly over the back of the sofa . "
98287	98291	98283	98285	Dear old mother	4864	" he said , "
98311	98345	98306	98306	you	4864	" And it is very likely that Mr. Pen was right , and that the foolish woman would have done almost as much for him as he said . Besides the works of English "
98348	98590	98591	98593	his wine merchants	4867	" which this diligent student devoured , he brought down boxes of the light literature of the neighbouring country of France : into the leaves of which when Helen dipped , she read such things as caused her to open her eyes with wonder . But Pen showed her that it was not he who made the books , though it was absolutely necessary that he should keep up his French by an acquaintance with the most celebrated writers of the day , and that it was as clearly his duty to read the eminent Paul de Kock , as to study Swift or Moliere . And Mrs. Pendennis yielded with a sigh of perplexity . But Miss Laura was warned off the books , both by his anxious mother , and that rigid moralist Mr. Arthur Pendennis himself , who , however he might be called upon to study every branch of literature in order to form his mind and to perfect his style , would by no means prescribe such a course of reading to a young lady whose business in life was very different . In the course of this long vacation Mr. Pen drank up the bin of claret which his father had laid in , and of which we have heard the son remark that there was not a headache in a hogshead ; and this wine being exhausted , he wrote for a further supply to "
98595	98630	98591	98593	his wine merchants	4867	" Messrs. Binney and Latham of Mark Lane , London : from whom , indeed , old Doctor Portman had recommended Pen to get a supply of port and sherry on going to college . "
98650	98660	98661	98661	They	4870	" the honest rector had remarked to the lad . "
98721	101125	101131	101131	ye	4873	" And the obedient young gentleman took the Doctor 's advice , and patronised Messrs. Binney and Latham at the rector 's suggestion . So when he wrote orders for a stock of wine to be sent down to the cellars at Fairoaks , he hinted that Messrs. B. and L. might send in his university account for wine at the same time with the Fairoaks bill . The poor widow was frightened at the amount . But Pen laughed at her old - fashioned views , said that the bill was moderate , that everybody drank claret and champagne now , and , finally , the widow paid , feeling dimly that the expenses of her household were increasing considerably , and that her narrow income would scarce suffice to meet them . But they were only occasional . Pen merely came home for a few weeks at the vacation . Laura and she might pinch when he was gone . In the brief time he was with them , ought they not to make him happy ? Arthur 's own allowances were liberal all this time ; indeed , much more so than those of the sons of far more wealthy men . Years before , the thrifty and affectionate John Pendennis , whose darling project it had ever been to give his son a university education , and those advantages of which his own father 's extravagance had deprived him , had begun laying by a store of money which he called Arthur 's Education Fund . Year after year in his book his executors found entries of sums vested as A. E. F. , and during the period subsequent to her husband 's decease , and before Pen 's entry at college , the widow had added sundry sums to this fund , so that when Arthur went up to Oxbridge it reached no inconsiderable amount . Let him be liberally allowanced , was Major Pendennis 's maxim . Let him make his first entree into the world as a gentleman , and take his place with men of good rank and station : after giving it to him , it will be his own duty to hold it . There is no such bad policy as stinting a boy - or putting him on a lower allowance than his fellows . Arthur will have to face the world and fight for himself presently . Meanwhile we shall have procured for him good friends , gentlemanly habits , and have him well backed and well trained against the time when the real struggle comes . And these liberal opinions the Major probably advanced both because they were just , and because he was not dealing with his own money . Thus young Pen , the only son of an estated country gentleman , with a good allowance , and a gentlemanlike bearing and person , looked to be a lad of much more consequence than he was really ; and was held by the Oxbridge authorities , tradesmen , and undergraduates , as quite a young buck and member of the aristocracy . His manner was frank , brave , and perhaps a little impertinent , as becomes a high - spirited youth . He was perfectly generous and free - handed with his money , which seemed pretty plentiful . He loved joviality , and had a good voice for a song . Boat - racing had not risen in Pen 's time to the fureur which , as we are given to understand , it has since attained in the university ; and riding and tandem - driving were the fashions of the ingenuous youth . Pen rode well to hounds , appeared in pink , as became a young buck , and , not particularly extravagant in equestrian or any other amusement , yet managed to run up a fine bill at Nile 's , the livery - stable keeper , and in a number of other quarters . In fact , this lucky young gentleman had almost every taste to a considerable degree . He was very fond of books of all sorts : Doctor Portman had taught him to like rare editions , and his own taste led him to like beautiful bindings . It was marvellous what tall copies , and gilding , and marbling , and blind - tooling , the booksellers and binders put upon Pen 's bookshelves . He had a very fair taste in matters of art , and a keen relish for prints of a high school - none of your French Opera Dancers , or tawdry Racing Prints , such as had delighted the simple eyes of Mr. Spicer , his predecessor - but your Stranges , and Rembrandt etchings , and Wilkies before the letter , with which his apartments were furnished presently in the most perfect good taste , as was allowed in the university , where this young fellow got no small reputation . We have mentioned that he exhibited a certain partiality for rings , jewellery , and fine raiment of all sorts ; and it must be owned that Mr. Pen , during his time at the university , was rather a dressy man , and loved to array himself in splendour . He and his polite friends would dress themselves out with as much care in order to go and dine at each other 's rooms , as other folks would who were going to enslave a mistress . They said he used to wear rings over his kid gloves , which he always denies ; but what follies will not youth perpetrate with its own admirable gravity and simplicity ? That he took perfumed baths is a truth ; and he used to say that he took them after meeting certain men of a very low set in hall . In Pen 's second year , when Miss Fotheringay made her chief hit in London , and scores of prints were published of her , Pen had one of these hung in his bedroom , and confided to the men of his set how awfully , how wildly , how madly , how passionately , he had loved that woman . He showed them in confidence the verses that he had written to her , and his brow would darken , his eyes roll , his chest heave with emotion as he recalled that fatal period of his life , and described the woes and agonies which he had suffered . The verses were copied out , handed about , sneered at , admired , passed from coterie to coterie . There are few things which elevate a lad in the estimation of his brother boys , more than to have a character for a great and romantic passion . Perhaps there is something noble in it at all times - among very young men it is considered heroic - Pen was pronounced a tremendous fellow . They said he had almost committed suicide : that he had fought a duel with a baronet about her . Freshmen pointed him out to each other . As at the promenade time at two o'clock he swaggered out of college , surrounded by his cronies , he was famous to behold . He was elaborately attired . He would ogle the ladies who came to lionise the university , and passed before him on the arms of happy gownsmen , and give his opinion upon their personal charms , or their toilettes , with the gravity of a critic whose experience entitled him to speak with authority . Men used to say that they had been walking with Pendennis , and were as pleased to be seen in his company as some of us would be if we walked with a duke down Pall Mall . He and the Proctor capped each other as they met , as if they were rival powers , and the men hardly knew which was the greater . In fact , in the course of his second year , Arthur Pendennis had become one of the men of fashion in the university . It is curious to watch that facile admiration , and simple fidelity of youth . They hang round a leader ; and wonder at him , and love him , and imitate him . No generous boy ever lived , I suppose , that has not had some wonderment of admiration for another boy ; and Monsieur Pen at Oxbridge had his school , his faithful band of friends and his rivals . When the young men heard at the haberdashers ' shops that Mr. Pendennis , of Boniface , had just ordered a crimson satin - cravat , you would see a couple of dozen crimson satin cravats in Main Street in the course of the week - and Simon , the Jeweller , was known to sell no less than two gross of Pendennis pins , from a pattern which the young gentleman had selected in his shop . Now if any person with an arithmetical turn of mind will take the trouble to calculate what a sum of money it would cost a young man to indulge freely in all the above propensities which we have said Mr. Pen possessed , it will be seen that a young fellow , with such liberal tastes and amusements , must needs in the course of two or three years spend or owe a very handsome sum of money . We have said our friend Pen had not a calculating turn . No one propensity of his was outrageously extravagant ; and it is certain that Paddington 's tailor 's account ; Guttlebury 's cook 's bill for dinners ; Dillon Tandy 's bill with Finn , the print seller , for Raphael - Morgheus and Landseer proofs , and Wormall 's dealings with Parkton , the great bookseller , for Aldine editions , black - letter folios , and richly illuminated Missals of the XVI . Century ; and Snaffle 's or Foker 's score with Nile the horsedealer , were , each and all of them , incomparably greater than any little bills which Mr. Pen might run up with the above - mentioned tradesmen . But Pendennis of Boniface had the advantage over all these young gentlemen , his friends and associates , of a universality of taste : and whereas young Lord Paddington did not care twopence for the most beautiful print , or to look into any gilt frame that had not a mirror within it ; and Guttlebury did not mind in the least how he was dressed , and had an aversion for horse exercise , nay a terror of it ; and Snaffle never read any printed works but the ' Racing Calendar ' or ' Bell 's Life , ' or cared for any manuscript except his greasy little scrawl of a betting - book : - our Catholic - minded young friend occupied himself in every one of the branches of science or pleasure above - mentioned , and distinguished himself tolerably in each . Hence young Pen got a prodigious reputation in the university , and was hailed as a sort of Crichton ; and as for the English verse prize , in competition for which we have seen him busily engaged at Fairoaks , Jones of Jesus carried it that year certainly , but the undergraduates thought Pen 's a much finer poem , and he had his verses printed at his own expense , and distributed in gilt morocco covers amongst his acquaintance . I found a copy of it lately in a dusty corner of Mr. Pen 's bookcases , and have it before me this minute , bound up in a collection of old Oxbridge tracts , university statutes , prize - poems by successful and unsuccessful candidates , declamations recited in the college chapel , speeches delivered at the Union Debating Society , and inscribed by Arthur with his name and college , Pendennis - Boniface ; or presented to him by his affectionate friend Thompson or Jackson , the author . How strange the epigraphs look in those half - boyish hands , and what a thrill the sight of the documents gives one after the lapse of a few lustres ! How fate , since that time , has removed some , estranged others , dealt awfully with all ! Many a hand is cold that wrote those kindly memorials , and that we pressed in the confident and generous grasp of youthful friendship . What passions our friendships were in those old days , how artless and void of doubt ! How the arm you were never tired of having linked in yours under the fair college avenues or by the river side , where it washes Magdalen Gardens , or Christ Church Meadows , or winds by Trinity and King 's , was withdrawn of necessity , when you entered presently the world , and each parted to push and struggle for himself through the great mob on the way through life ! Are we the same men now that wrote those inscriptions - that read those poems ? that delivered or heard those essays and speeches so simple , so pompous , so ludicrously solemn ; parodied so artlessly from books , and spoken with smug chubby faces , and such an admirable aping of wisdom and gravity ? Here is the book before me : it is scarcely fifteen years old . Here is Jack moaning with despair and Byronic misanthropy , whose career at the university was one of unmixed milk - punch . Here is Tom 's daring Essay in defence of suicide and of republicanism in general , apropos of the death of Roland and the Girondins - Tom 's , who wears the starchest tie in all the diocese , and would go to Smithfield rather than eat a beefsteak on a Friday in Lent . Here is Bob of the - - Circuit , who has made a fortune in Railroad Committees , and whose dinners are so good - bellowing out with Tancred and Godfrey , "
101185	101847	101180	101180	i	0	" After which comes a mellifluous description of the gardens of Sharon and the maids of Salem , and a prophecy that roses shall deck the entire country of Syria , and a speedy reign of peace be established - all in undeniably decasyllabic lines , and the queerest aping of sense and sentiment and poetry . And there are Essays and Poems along with these grave parodies , and boyish exercises which are at once so frank and false and mirthful , yet , somehow , so mournful by youthful hands , that shall never write more . Fate has interposed darkly , and the young voices are silent , and the eager brains have ceased to work . This one had genius and a great descent , and seemed to be destined for honours which now are of little worth to him : that had virtue , learning , genius - every faculty and endowment which might secure love , admiration , and worldly fame : an obscure and solitary churchyard contains the grave of many fond hopes , and the pathetic stone which bids them farewell - I saw the sun shining on it in the fall of last year , and heard the sweet village choir raising anthems round about . What boots whether it be Westminster or a little country spire which covers your ashes , or if , a few days sooner or later , the world forgets you ? Amidst these friends , then , and a host more , Pen passed more than two brilliant and happy years of his life . He had his fill of pleasure and popularity . No dinner- or supper - party was complete without him ; and Pen 's jovial wit , and Pen 's songs , and dashing courage and frank and manly bearing , charmed all the undergraduates , and even disarmed the tutors who cried out at his idleness , and murmured about his extravagant way of life . Though he became the favourite and leader of young men who were much his superiors in wealth and station , he was much too generous to endeavour to propitiate them by any meanness or cringing on his own part , and would not neglect the humblest man of his acquaintance in order to curry favour with the richest young grandee in the university . His name is still remembered at the Union Debating Club , as one of the brilliant orators of his day . By the way , from having been an ardent Tory in his freshman 's year , his principles took a sudden turn afterwards , and he became a liberal of the most violent order . He avowed himself a Dantonist , and asserted that Louis the Sixteenth was served right . And as for Charles the First , he vowed that he would chop off that monarch 's head with his own right hand were he then in the room at the Union Debating Club , and had Cromwell no other executioner for the traitor . He and Lord Magnus Charters , the Marquis of Runnymede 's son , before - mentioned , were the most truculent republicans of their day . There are reputations of this sort made , quite independent of the collegiate hierarchy , in the republic of gownsmen . A man may be famous in the Honour - lists and entirely unknown to the undergraduates : who elect kings and chieftains of their own , whom they admire and obey , as negro - gangs have private black sovereigns in their own body , to whom they pay an occult obedience , besides that which they publicly profess for their owners and drivers . Among the young ones Pen became famous and popular : not that he did much , but there was a general determination that he could do a great deal if he chose . "
101858	101863	101864	101864	he	1151	" the men said , "
101869	102127	101864	101864	he	1151	" He was backed for the Greek Ode won by Smith of Trinity ; everybody was sure he would have the Latin hexameter prize which Brown of St. John 's , however , carried off , and in this way one university honour after another was lost by him , until , after two or three failures , Mr. Pen ceased to compete . But he got a declamation prize in his own college , and brought home to his mother and Laura at Fairoaks a set of prize - books begilt with the college arms , and so big , well - bound , and magnificent , that these ladies thought there had been no such prize ever given in a college before as this of Pen 's , and that he had won the very largest honour which Oxbridge was capable of awarding . As vacation after vacation and term after term passed away without the desired news that Pen had sate for any scholarship or won any honour , Doctor Portman grew mightily gloomy in his behaviour towards Arthur , and adopted a sulky grandeur of deportment towards him , which the lad returned by a similar haughtiness . One vacation he did not call upon the Doctor at all , much to his mother 's annoyance , who thought that it was a privilege to enter the Rectory - house at Clavering , and listened to Dr. Portman 's antique jokes and stories , though ever so often repeated , with unfailing veneration . "
102137	102142	102143	102143	He	13989	" , Pen said . "
102188	102895	102182	102182	his	13989	" The tacit feud between Pen and the Doctor made the widow nervous , so that she too avoided Portman , and was afraid to go to the Rectory when Arthur was at home . One Sunday in the last long vacation , the wretched boy pushed his rebellious spirit so far as not to go to church , and he was seen at the gate of the Clavering Arms smoking a cigar , in the face of the congregation as it issued from St. Mary 's . There was an awful sensation in the village society , Portman prophesied Pen 's ruin after that , and groaned in spirit over the rebellious young prodigal . So did Helen tremble in her heart , and little Laura - Laura had grown to be a fine young stripling by this time , graceful and fair , clinging round Helen and worshipping her , with a passionate affection . Both of these women felt that their boy was changed . He was no longer the artless Pen of old days , so brave , so artless , so impetuous , and tender . His face looked careworn and haggard , his voice had a deeper sound , and tones more sarcastic . Care seemed to be pursuing him ; but he only laughed when his mother questioned him , and parried her anxious queries with some scornful jest . Nor did he spend much of his vacations at home ; he went on visits to one great friend or another , and scared the quiet pair at Fairoaks by stories of great houses whither he had been invited ; and by talking of lords without their titles . Honest Harry Foker , who had been the means of introducing Arthur Pendennis to that set of young men at the university , from whose society and connexions Arthur 's uncle expected that the lad would get so much benefit ; who had called for Arthur 's first song at his first supper - party ; and who had presented him at the Barmecide Club , where none but the very best men of Oxbridge were admitted it consisted in Pen 's time of six noblemen , eight gentlemen - pensioners , and twelve of the most select commoners of the university , soon found himself left far behind by the young freshman in the fashionable world of Oxbridge , and being a generous and worthy fellow , without a spark of envy in his composition , was exceedingly pleased at the success of his young protege , and admired Pen quite as much as any of the other youth did . I was he who followed Pen now , and quoted his sayings ; learned his songs , and retailed them at minor supper - parties , and was never weary of hearing them from the gifted young poet 's own mouth - for a good deal of the time which Mr. Pen might have employed much more advantageously in the pursuit of the regular scholastic studies , was given up to the composition of secular ballads , which he sang about at parties according to university wo nt . It had been as well for Arthur if the honest Foker had remained for some time at college , for , with all his vivacity , he was a prudent young man , and often curbed Pen 's propensity to extravagance : but Foker 's collegiate career did not last very long after Arthur 's entrance at Boniface . Repeated differences with the university authorities caused Mr. Foker to quit Oxbridge in an untimely manner . He would persist in attending races on the neighbouring Hungerford Heath , in spite of the injunctions of his academic superiors . He never could be got to frequent the chapel of the college with that regularity of piety which Alma Mater demands from her children ; tandems , which are abominations in the eyes of the heads and tutors , were Foker 's greatest delight , and so reckless was his driving and frequent the accidents and upsets out of his drag , that Pen called taking a drive with him taking the "
102900	103149	102182	102182	his	13989	" finally , having a dinner - party at his rooms to entertain some friends from London , nothing would satisfy Mr. Foker but painting Mr. Buck 's door vermilion , in which freak he was caught by the proctors ; and although young Black Strap , the celebrated negro fighter , who was one of Mr. Foker 's distinguished guests , and was holding the can of paint while the young artist operated on the door , knocked down two of the proctor 's attendants and performed prodigies of valour , yet these feats rather injured than served Foker , whom the proctor knew very well and who was taken with the brush in his hand , and who was summarily convened and sent down from the university . The tutor wrote a very kind and feeling letter to Lady Agnes on the subject , stating that everybody was fond of the youth ; that he never meant harm to any mortal creature ; that he for his own part would have been delighted to pardon the harmless little boyish frolic , had not its unhappy publicity rendered it impossible to look the freak over , and breathing the most fervent wishes for the young fellow 's welfare - wishes no doubt sincere , for Foker , as we know , came of a noble family on his mother 's side , and on the other was heir to a great number of thousand pounds a year . "
103155	103167	102182	102182	his	13989	" said Foker , talking over the matter with Pen , - "
103640	103648	103631	103631	I	0	" But Pen , laughingly , said , "
103681	103716	103717	103717	One	14276	" and he and Foker parted , not without many dark forebodings on the latter 's part with regard to his friend , who Harry thought was travelling speedily on the road to ruin . "
103726	103744	103717	103717	One	14276	" Pen said , in a dandified manner , jingling some sovereigns in his waistcoat - pocket . "
103781	104780	103776	103776	I	0	" - And he walked off , after having taken leave of poor Foker , who went away without any beat of drum , or offer to drive the coach out of Oxbridge , to superintend a little dinner which he was going to give at his own rooms in Boniface , about which dinners , the cook of the college , who had a great respect for Mr. Pendennis , always took especial pains for his young favourite . CHAPTER XX Rake 's Progress Some short time before Mr. Foker 's departure from Oxbridge , there had come up to Boniface a gentleman who had once , as it turned out , belonged to the other University of Camford , which he had quitted on account of some differences with the tutors and authorities there . This gentleman , whose name was Horace Bloundell , was of the ancient Suffolk family of Bloundell - Bloundell , of Bloundell - Bloundell Hall , Bloundell - Bloundellshire , as the young wags used to call it ; and no doubt it was on account of his descent , and because Dr. Donne , the Master of Boniface , was a Suffolk man , and related perhaps to the family , that Mr. Horace Bloundell was taken in at Boniface , after St. George 's and one or two other Colleges had refused to receive him . There was a living in the family , which it was important for Mr. Bloundell to hold ; and , being in a dragoon regiment at the time when his third brother , for whom the living was originally intended , sickened and died , Mr. Bloundell determined upon quitting crimson pantaloons and sable shakos , for the black coat and white neckcloth of the English divine . The misfortunes which occurred at Camford , occasioned some slight disturbance to Mr. Bloundell 's plans ; but although defeated upon one occasion , the resolute ex - dragoon was not dismayed , and set to work to win a victory elsewhere . In Pen 's second year Major Pendennis paid a brief visit to his nephew , and was introduced to several of Pen 's university friends - the gentle and polite Lord Plinlimmon , the gallant and open - hearted Magnus Charters , the sly and witty Harland ; the intrepid Ringwood , who was called Rupert in the Union Debating Club , from his opinions and the bravery of his blunders ; Broadbent , styled Barebones Broadbent from the republican nature of his opinions he was of a dissenting family from Bristol and a perfect Boanerges of debate ; Mr. Bloundell - Bloundell finally , who had at once taken his place among the select of the university . Major Pendennis , though he did not understand Harland 's Greek quotations , or quite appreciate Broadbent 's thick shoes and dingy hands , was nevertheless delighted with the company assembled round his nephew , and highly approved of all the young men with the exception of that one who gave himself the greatest airs in the society , and affected most to have the manners of a man of the world . As he and Pen sate at breakfast on the morning after the party in the rooms of the latter , the Major gave his opinions regarding the young men , with whom he was in the greatest good - humour . He had regaled them with some of his stories , which , though not quite so fresh in London where people have a diseased appetite for novelty in the way of anecdotes , were entirely new at Oxbridge , and the lads heard them with that honest sympathy , that eager pleasure , that boisterous laughter , or that profound respect , so rare in the metropolis , and which must be so delightful to the professed raconteur . Only once or twice during the telling of the anecdote Mr. Bloundell 's face wore a look of scorn , or betrayed by its expression that he was acquainted with the tales narrated . Once he had the audacity to question the accuracy of one of the particulars of a tale as given by Major Pendennis , and gave his own version of the anecdote , about which he knew he was right , for he heard it openly talked of at the Club by So - and - so and T'other who were present at the business . The youngsters present looked up with wonder at their associate , who dared to interrupt the Major - few of them could appreciate that melancholy grace and politeness with which Major Pendennis at once acceded to Mr. Bloundell 's version of the story , and thanked him for correcting his own error . They stared on the next occasion of meeting , when Bloundell spoke in contemptuous terms of old Pen ; said everybody knew old Pen , regular old trencherman at Gaunt House , notorious old bore , regular old fogy . Major Pendennis on his side liked Mr. Bloundell not a whit . These sympathies are pretty sure to be mutual amongst men and women , and if , for my part , some kind friend tells me that such and such a man has been abusing me , I am almost sure , on my own side , that I have a misliking to such and such a man . We like or dislike each other , as folks like or dislike the odour of certain flowers , or the taste of certain dishes or wines , or certain books . We ca n't tell why - but as a general rule , all the reasons in the world will not make us love Dr. Fell , and as sure as we dislike him , we may be sure that he dislikes us . So the Major said , "
104933	104934	104918	104919	Mr. Bloundell	898	" "
104945	104951	104943	104943	Bloundell	898	" cried Pen , laughing ; "
105014	105015	105010	105012	O Mong Roy	1181	" "
105037	105046	105047	105048	that man	2528	" the Major said , chipping his egg ; "
105287	105953	105954	105954	You	4927	" Poor Pen ! the worthy uncle little knew how often those dinners took place , while the reckless young Amphitryon delighted to show his hospitality and skill in gourmandise . There is no art than that so long to learn , so difficult to acquire , so impossible and beyond the means of many unhappy people ! about which boys are more anxious to have an air of knowingness . A taste and knowledge of wines and cookery appears to them to be the sign of an accomplished roue and manly gentleman . I like to see them wink at a glass of claret , as if they had an intimate acquaintance with it , and discuss a salmi - poor boys - it is only when they grow old that they know they know nothing of the science , when perhaps their conscience whispers them that the science is in itself little worth , and that a leg of mutton and content is as good as the dinners of pontiffs . But little Pen , in his character of Admirable Crichton , thought it necessary to be a great judge and practitioner of dinners ; we have just said how the college cook respected him , and shall soon have to deplore that that worthy man so blindly trusted our Pen . In the third year of the lad 's residence at Oxbridge , his staircase was by no means encumbered with dish - covers and desserts , and waiters carrying in dishes , and skips opening iced champagne ; crowds of different sorts of attendants , with faces sulky or piteous , hung about the outer oak , and assailed the unfortunate lad as he issued out of his den . Nor did his guardian 's advice take any effect , or induce Mr. Pen to avoid the society of the disreputable Mr. Bloundell . What young men like in their companions is , what had got Pen a great part of his own repute and popularity , a real or supposed knowledge of life . A man who has seen the world , or can speak of it with a knowing air - a roue , or Lovelace , who has his adventures to relate , is sure of an admiring audience among boys . It is hard to confess , but so it is . We respect that sort of prowess . From our school - days we have been taught to admire it . Are there five in the hundred , out of the hundreds and hundreds of English school - boys , brought up at our great schools and colleges , that must not own at one time of their lives to having read and liked Don Juan ? Awful propagation of evil ! - The idea of it should make the man tremble who holds the pen , lest untruth , or impurity , or unjust anger , or unjust praise escape it . One such diseased creature as this is enough to infect a whole colony , and the tutors of Boniface began to find the moral tone of their college lowered and their young men growing unruly , and almost ungentleman - like , soon after Mr. Bloundell 's arrival at Oxbridge . The young magnates of the neighbouring great College of St. George 's , who regarded Pen , and in whose society he lived , were not taken in by Bloundell 's flashy graces , and rakish airs of fashion . Broadbent called him Captain Macheath , and said he would live to be hanged . Foker , during his brief stay at the university with Macheath , with characteristic caution declined to say anything in the Captain 's disfavour , but hinted to Pen that he had better have him for a partner at whist than play against him , and better back him at ecarte than bet on the other side . "
105966	105975	105964	105964	Pen	799	" was the astute young gentleman 's remark : "
106021	106105	106016	106017	the Captain	14344	" But beyond these dark suggestions and generalities , the cautious Foker could not be got to speak . Not that his advice would have had more weight with a headstrong young man , than advice commonly has with a lad who is determined on pursuing his own way . Pen 's appetite for pleasure was insatiable , and he rushed at it wherever it presented itself , with an eagerness which bespoke his fiery constitution and youthful health . He called taking pleasure "
106109	106661	105987	105987	Pen	799	" and quoted well - known maxims from Terence , from Horace , from Shakspeare , to show that one should do all that might become a man . He bade fair to be utterly used up and a roue , in a few years , if he were to continue at the pace at which he was going . One night after a supper - party in college , at which Pen and Macheath had been present , and at which a little quiet vingt - et - un had been played an amusement much pleasanter to men in their second and third year than the boisterous custom of singing songs , which bring the proctors about the rooms , and which have grown quite stale by this time , every man having expended his budget - as the men had taken their caps and were going away , after no great losses or winnings on any side , Mr. Bloundell playfully took up a green wine - glass from the supper - table , which had been destined to contain iced cup , but into which he inserted something still more pernicious , namely a pair of dice , which the gentleman took out of his waistcoat - pocket , and put into the glass . Then giving the glass a graceful wave which showed that his hand was quite experienced in the throwing of dice , he called sevens the main , and whisking the ivory cubes gently on the table , swept them up lightly again from the cloth , and repeated this process two or three times . The other men looked on , Pen , of course , among the number , who had never used the dice as yet , except to play a humdrum game of backgammon at home . Mr. Bloundell , who had a good voice , began to troll out the chorus from Robert the Devil , an Opera then in great vogue , in which chorus many of the men joined , especially Pen , who was in very high spirits , having won a good number of shillings and half - crowns at the vingt - et - un - and presently , instead of going home , most of the party were seated round the table playing at dice , the green glass going round from hand to hand until Pen finally shivered it , after throwing six mains . From that night Pen plunged into the delights of the game of hazard , as eagerly as it was his custom to pursue any new pleasure . Dice can be played of mornings as well as after dinner or supper . Bloundell would come into Pen 's rooms after breakfast , and it was astonishing how quick the time passed as the bones were rattling . They had little quiet parties with closed doors , and Bloundell devised a box lined with felt , so that the dice should make no noise , and their tell - tale rattle not bring the sharp - eared tutors up to the rooms . Bloundell , Ringwood , and Pen were once very nearly caught by Mr. Buck , who , passing in the Quadrangle , thought he heard the words "
106669	106864	105987	105987	Pen	799	" through Pen 's open window ; but when the tutor got into Arthur 's rooms he found the lads with three Homers before them , and Pen said he was trying to coach the two other men , and asked Mr. Buck with great gravity what was the present condition of the River Scamander , and whether it was navigable or no ? Mr. Arthur Pendennis did not win much money in these transactions with Mr. Bloundell , or indeed gain good of any kind except a knowledge of the odds at hazard , which he might have learned out of books . Captain Macheath had other accomplishments which he exercised for Pen 's benefit . The Captain 's stories had a great and unfortunate charm for Arthur , who was never tired of hearing Bloundell 's histories of garrison conquests , and of his feats in country - quarters . - He had been at Paris , and had plenty of legends about the Palais Royal , and the Salon , and Frascati 's . He had gone to the Salon one night , after a dinner at the Cafe de Paris , "
106919	106974	106917	106917	hay	4933	" the Captain said . Pen 's eyes glistened with excitement as he heard this story . He respected the man who could win such a sum of money . He sighed , and said it would set him all right . Macheath laughed , and told him to drink another drop of Maraschino . "
106986	107127	106975	106975	I	0	" he added ; and so indeed the Captain could have done , without any further trouble than that of invention , with which portion of the poetic faculty Nature had copiously endowed him . He laughed to scorn Pen 's love for Miss Fotheringay , when he came to hear of that amour from Arthur , as he pretty soon did , for , we have said , Pen was not averse to telling the story now to his confidential friends , and he and they were rather proud of the transaction . But Macheath took away all Pen 's conceit on this head , not by demonstrating the folly of the lad 's passion for an uneducated woman much his senior in years , but by exposing his absurd desire of gratifying his passion in a legitimate way . "
107131	107135	107136	107136	you	4935	" said he , "
107144	107158	107159	107159	She	4935	" and he named one of the most notorious actresses on the stage . "
107168	107793	107159	107159	She	4935	" He knew twenty men who were openly admirers of her , and named them , and the sums each had spent upon her . I know no kind of calumny more frightful or frequent than this which takes away the character of women , no men more reckless and mischievous than those who lightly use it , and no kind of cowards more despicable than the people who invent these slanders . Is it , or not , a misfortune that a man , himself of a candid disposition , and disposed , like our friend Pen , to blurt out the truth on all occasions , begins life by believing all that is said to him ? Would it be better for a lad to be less trustful , and so less honest ? It requires no small experience of the world to know that a man , who has no especial reason thereto , is telling you lies . I am not sure whether it is not best to go on being duped for a certain time . At all events , our honest Pen had a natural credulity , which enabled him to accept all statements which were made to him , and he took every one of Captain Macheath 's figments as if they had been the most unquestioned facts of history . So Bloundell 's account about Miss Fotheringay pained and mortified Pen exceedingly . If he had been ashamed of his passion before , - what were his feelings regarding it now , when the object of so much pure flame and adoration turned out to be only a worthless impostor , an impostor detected by all but him ? It never occurred to Pen to doubt the fact , or to question whether the stories of a man who , like his new friend , never spoke well of any woman , were likely to be true . One Easter vacation , when Pen had announced to his mother and uncle his intention not to go down , but stay at Oxbridge and read , Mr. Pen was nevertheless induced to take a brief visit to London in company with his friend Mr. Bloundell . They put up at a hotel in Covent Garden , where Bloundell had a tick , as he called it , and took the pleasures of the town very freely after the wo nt of young university men . Bloundell still belonged to a military club , whither he took Pen to dine once or twice the young men would drive thither in a cab , trembling lest they should meet Major Pendennis on his beat in Pall Mall , and here Pen was introduced to a number of gallant young fellows with spurs and mustachios , with whom he drank pale - ale of mornings and beat the town of a night . Here he saw a deal of life , indeed : nor in his career about the theatres and singing - houses which these roaring young blades frequented , was he very likely to meet his guardian . One night , nevertheless , they were very near to each other : a plank only separating Pen , who was in the boxes of the Museum Theatre , from the Major , who was in Lord Steyne 's box , along with that venerated nobleman . The Fotheringay was in the pride of her glory . Shad made a hit : that is , she had drawn very good houses for nearly a year , had starred the provinces with great eclat , had come back to shine in London with somewhat diminished lustre , and now was acting with "
107801	107802	107159	107159	She	4935	" "
107811	109483	109484	109484	I	0	" as the play - bills avowed , to houses in which there was plenty of room for anybody who wanted to see her . It was not the first time Pen had seen her , since that memorable day when the two had parted in Chatteris . In the previous year , when the town was making much of her , and the press lauded her beauty , Pen had found a pretext for coming to London in term - time , and had rushed off to the theatre to see his old flame . He recollected it rather than renewed it . He remembered how ardently he used to be on the look - out at Chatteris , when the speech before Ophelia 's or Mrs. Haller 's entrance on the stage was made by the proper actor . Now , as the actor spoke , he had a sort of feeble thrill : as the house began to thunder with applause , and Ophelia entered with her old bow and sweeping curtsey , Pen felt a slight shock and blushed very much as he looked at her , and could not help thinking that all the house was regarding him . He hardly heard her for the first part of the play : and he thought with such rage of the humiliation to which she had subjected him , that he began to fancy he was jealous and in love with her still . But that illusion did not last very long . He ran round to the stage - door of the theatre to see her if possible , but he did not succeed . She passed indeed under his nose with a female companion , but he did not know her , - nor did she recognise him . The next night he came in late , and stayed very quietly for the afterpiece , and on the third and last night of his stay in London - why , Taglioni was going to dance at the Opera , - Taglioni ! and there was to be Don Giovanni , which he admired of all things in the world : so Mr. Pen went to Don Giovanni and Taglioni . This time the illusion about her was quite gone . She was not less handsome , but she was not the same , somehow . The light was gone out of her eyes which used to flash there , or Pen 's no longer were dazzled by it . The rich voice spoke as of old , yet it did not make Pen 's bosom thrill as formerly . He thought he could recognise the brogue underneath : the accents seemed to him coarse and false . It annoyed him to hear the same emphasis on the same words , only uttered a little louder : worse than this , it annoyed him to think that he should ever have mistaken that loud imitation for genius , or melted at those mechanical sobs and sighs . He felt that it was in another life almost , that it was another man who had so madly loved her . He was ashamed and bitterly humiliated , and very lonely . Ah , poor Pen ! the delusion is better than the truth sometimes , and fine dreams than dismal waking . They went and had an uproarious supper that night , and Mr. Pen had a fine headache the next morning , with which he went back to Oxbridge , having spent all his ready money . As all this narrative is taken from Pen 's own confessions , so that the reader may be assured of the truth of every word of it , and as Pen himself never had any accurate notion of the manner in which he spent his money , and plunged himself in much deeper pecuniary difficulties , during his luckless residence at Oxbridge University , it is , of course , impossible for me to give any accurate account of his involvements , beyond that general notion of his way of life , which has been sketched a few pages back . He does not speak too hardly of the roguery of the university tradesmen , or of those in London whom he honoured with his patronage at the outset of his career . Even Finch , the money - lender , to whom Bloundell introduced him , and with whom he had various transactions , in which the young rascal 's signature appeared upon stamped paper , treated him , according to Pen 's own account , with forbearance , and never mulcted him of more than a hundred per cent . The old college - cook , his fervent admirer , made him a private bill , offered to send him in dinners up to the very last , and never would have pressed his account to his dying day . There was that kindness and frankness about Arthur Pendennis , which won most people who came in contact with him , and which , if it rendered him an easy prey to rogues , got him , perhaps , more goodwill than he merited from many honest men . It was impossible to resist his good - nature , or , in his worst moments , not to hope for his rescue from utter ruin . At the time of his full career of university pleasure , he would leave the gayest party to go and sit with a sick friend . He never knew the difference between small and great in the treatment of his acquaintances , however much the unlucky lad 's tastes , which were of the sumptuous order , led him to prefer good society ; he was only too ready to share his guinea with a poor friend , and when he got money had an irresistible propensity for paying , which he never could conquer through life . In his third year at college , the duns began to gather awfully round about him , and there was a levee at his oak which scandalised the tutors , and would have scared many a stouter heart . With some of these he used to battle , some he would bully under Mr. Bloundell 's directions , who was a master in this art , though he took a degree in no other , and some deprecate . And it is reported of him that little Mary Frodsham , the daughter of a certain poor gilder and frame - maker , whom Mr. Pen had thought fit to employ , and who had made a number of beautiful frames for his fine prints , coming to Pendennis with a piteous tale that her father was ill with ague , and that there was an execution in their house , Pen in an anguish of remorse rushed away , pawned his grand watch and every single article of jewellery except two old gold sleeve - buttons , which had belonged to his father , and rushed with the proceeds to Frodsham 's shop , where , with tears in his eyes , and the deepest repentance and humility , he asked the poor tradesman 's pardon . This , young gentlemen , is not told as an instance of Pen 's virtue , but rather of his weakness . It would have been much more virtuous to have had no prints at all . He still stood for the baubles which he sold in order to pay Frodsham 's bill , and his mother had cruelly to pinch herself in order to discharge the jeweller 's account , so that she was in the end the sufferer by the lad 's impertinent fancies and follies . We are not presenting Pen to you as a hero or a model , only as a lad , who , in the midst of a thousand vanities and weaknesses , has as yet some generous impulses , and is not altogether dishonest . We have said it was to the scandal of Mr. Buck the tutor that Pen 's extravagances became known : from the manner in which he entered college , the associates he kept , and the introductions of Doctor Portman and the Major , Buck for a long time thought that his pupil was a man of large property , and wondered rather that he only wore a plain gown . Once on going up to London to the levee with an address from his Majesty 's Loyal University of Oxbridge , Buck had seen Major Pendennis at St. James 's in conversation with two knights of the garter , in the carriage of one of whom the dazzled tutor saw the Major whisked away after the levee . He asked Pen to wine the instant he came back , let him off from chapels and lectures more than ever , and felt perfectly sure that he was a young gentleman of large estate . Thus , he was thunderstruck when he heard the truth , and received a dismal confession from Pen . His university debts were large , and the tutor had nothing to do , and of course Pen did not acquaint him , with his London debts . What man ever does tell all when pressed by his friends about his liabilities ? The tutor learned enough to know that Pen was poor , that he had spent a handsome , almost a magnificent allowance , and had raised around him such a fine crop of debts , as it would be very hard work for any man to mow down ; for there is no plant that grows so rapidly when once it has taken root . Perhaps it was because she was so tender and good that Pen was terrified lest his mother should know of his sins . "
109494	109506	109484	109484	I	0	" he said to the tutor in an agony of grief . "
109518	109541	109509	109509	sir	2261	" - and he repented , and he wished he had the time to come over again , and he asked himself , "
109570	109630	109509	109509	sir	2261	" They were not shy , but Pen thought they were , and slunk from them during his last terms at college . He was as gloomy as a death's - head at parties , which he avoided of his own part , or to which his young friends soon ceased to invite him . Everybody knew that Pendennis was "
109634	111404	109509	109509	sir	2261	" That man Bloundell , who could pay nobody , and who was obliged to go down after three terms , was his ruin , the men said . His melancholy figure might be seen shirking about the lonely quadrangles in his battered old cap and torn gown , and he who had been the pride of the university but a year before , the man whom all the young ones loved to look at , was now the object of conversation at freshmen 's wine - parties , and they spoke of him with wonder and awe . At last came the Degree Examinations . Many a young man of his year whose hob - nailed shoes Pen had derided , and whose face or coat he had caricatured - many a man whom he had treated with scorn in the lecture - room or crushed with his eloquence in the debating - club - many of his own set who had not half his brains , but a little regularity and constancy of occupation , took high places in the honours or passed with decent credit . And where in the list was Pen the superb , Pen the wit and dandy , Pen the poet and orator ? Ah , where was Pen the widow 's darling and sole pride ? Let us hide our heads , and shut up the page . The lists came out ; and a dreadful rumour rushed through the university , that Pendennis of Boniface was plucked . CHAPTER XXI Flight after Defeat Everybody who has the least knowledge of Heraldry and the Peerage must be aware that the noble family of which , as we know , Helen Pendennis was a member , bears for a crest , a nest full of little pelicans pecking at the ensanguined bosom of a big maternal bird , which plentifully supplies the little wretches with the nutriment on which , according to the heraldic legend , they are supposed to be brought up . Very likely female pelicans like so to bleed under the selfish little beaks of their young ones : it is certain that women do . There must be some sort of pleasure , which we men do n't understand , which accompanies the pain of being scarified , and indeed I believe some women would rather actually so suffer than not . They like sacrificing themselves in behalf of the object which their instinct teaches them to love . Be it for a reckless husband , a dissipated son , a darling scapegrace of a brother , how ready their hearts are to pour out their best treasures for the benefit of the cherished person ; and what a deal of this sort of enjoyment are we , on one side , ready to give the soft creatures ! There is scarce a man that reads this , but has administered pleasure in this fashion to his womankind , and has treated them to the luxury of forgiving him . They do n't mind how they live themselves ; but when the prodigal comes home they make a rejoicing , and kill the fatted calf for him : and at the very first hint that the sinner is returning , the kind angels prepare their festival , and Mercy and Forgiveness go smiling out to welcome him . I hope it may be so always for all : if we have only Justice to look to , Heaven help us ! During the latter part of Pen 's residence at the University of Oxbridge , his uncle 's partiality had greatly increased for the lad . The Major was proud of Arthur , who had high spirits , frank manners , a good person , and high gentleman - like bearing . It pleased the old London bachelor to see Pen walking with the young patricians of his university , and he who was never known to entertain his friends , and whose stinginess had passed into a sort of byword among some wags at the Club , who envied his many engagements , and did not choose to consider his poverty was charmed to give his nephew and the young lords snug little dinners at his lodgings , and to regale them with good claret , and his very best bons mots and stories : some of which would be injured by the repetition , for the Major 's manner of telling them was incomparably neat and careful ; and others , whereof the repetition would do good to nobody . He paid his court to their parents through the young men , and to himself as it were by their company . He made more than one visit to Oxbridge , where the young fellows were amused by entertaining the old gentleman , and gave parties and breakfasts and fetes , partly to joke him and partly to do him honour . He plied them with his stories . He made himself juvenile and hilarious in the company of the young lords . He went to hear Pen at a grand debate at the Union , crowed and cheered , and rapped his stick in chorus with the cheers of the men , and was astounded at the boy 's eloquence and fire . He thought he had got a young Pitt for a nephew . He had an almost paternal fondness for Pen . He wrote to the lad letters with playful advice and the news of the town . He bragged about Arthur at his Clubs , and introduced him with pleasure into his conversation ; saying , that , Egad , the young fellows were putting the old ones to the wall ; that the lads who were coming up , young Lord Plinlimmon , a friend of my boy , young Lord Magnus Charters , a chum of my scapegrace , etc . , would make a greater figure in the world than even their fathers had done before them . He asked permission to bring Arthur to a grand fete at Gaunt House ; saw him with ineffable satisfaction dancing with the sisters of the young noblemen before mentioned ; and gave himself as much trouble to procure cards of invitation for the lad to some good houses , as if he had been a mamma with a daughter to marry , and not an old half - pay officer in a wig . And he boasted everywhere of the boy 's great talents , and remarkable oratorical powers ; and of the brilliant degree he was going to take . Lord Runnymede would take him on his embassy , or the Duke would bring him in for one of his boroughs , he wrote over and over again to Helen ; who , for her part , was too ready to believe anything that anybody chose to say in favour of her son . And all this pride and affection of uncle and mother had been trampled down by Pen 's wicked extravagance and idleness ! I do n't envy Pen 's feelings as the phrase is , as he thought of what he had done . He had slept , and the tortoise had won the race . He had marred at its outset what might have been a brilliant career . He had dipped ungenerously into a generous mother 's purse ; basely and recklessly spilt her little cruse . O ! it was a coward hand that could strike and rob a creature so tender . And if Pen felt the wrong which he had done to others , are we to suppose that a young gentleman of his vanity did not feel still more keenly the shame he had brought upon himself ? Let us be assured that there is no more cruel remorse than that ; and no groans more piteous than those of wounded self - love . Like Joel Miller 's friend , the Senior Wrangler , who bowed to the audience from his box at the play , because he and the king happened to enter the theatre at the same time , only with a fatuity by no means so agreeable to himself , poor Arthur Pendennis felt perfectly convinced that all England would remark the absence of his name from the examination - lists , and talk about his misfortune . His wounded tutor , his many duns , the skip and bed - maker who waited upon him , the undergraduates of his own time and the years below him , whom he had patronised or scorned - how could he bear to look any of them in the face now ? He rushed to his rooms , into which he shut himself , and there he penned a letter to his tutor , full of thanks , regards , remorse , and despair , requesting that his name might be taken off the college books , and intimating a wish and expectation that death would speedily end the woes of the disgraced Arthur Pendennis . Then he slunk out , scarcely knowing whither he went , but mechanically taking the unfrequented little lanes by the backs of the colleges , until he cleared the university precincts , and got down to the banks of the Camisis river , now deserted , but so often alive with the boat - races , and the crowds of cheering gownsmen , he wandered on and on , until he found himself at some miles ' distance from Oxbridge , or rather was found by some acquaintances leaving that city . As Pen went up a hill , a drizzling January rain beating in his face , and his ragged gown flying behind him - for he had not divested himself of his academical garments since the morning - a postchaise came rattling up the road , on the box of which a servant was seated , whilst within , or rather half out of the carriage window , sate a young gentleman smoking a cigar , and loudly encouraging the postboy . It was our young acquaintance of Baymouth Mr. Spavin , who had got his degree , and was driving homewards in triumph in his yellow postchaise . He caught a sight of the figure , madly gesticulating as he worked up the hill , and of poor Pen 's pale and ghastly face as the chaise whirled by him . "
111407	111546	111547	111547	I	0	" roared Mr. Spavin to the postboy , and the horses stopped in their mad career , and the carriage pulled up some fifty yards before Pen . He presently heard his own name shouted , and beheld the upper half of the body of Mr. Spavin thrust out of the side - window of the vehicle , and beckoning Pen vehemently towards it . Pen stopped , hesitated - nodded his head fiercely , and pointed onwards , as if desirous that the postillion should proceed . He did not speak : but his countenance must have looked very desperate , for young Spavin , having stared at him with an expression of blank alarm , jumped out of the carriage presently , ran towards Pen holding out his hand , and grasping Pen 's , said , "
111567	111568	111547	111547	I	0	" "
111578	111586	111569	111569	I	0	" said Pen , with an imprecation . "
111593	111600	111569	111569	I	0	" said Mr. Spavin , smiling . "
111666	111718	111658	111658	You	799	" Pen looked at his early acquaintance , - who had been plucked , who had been rusticated , who had only , after repeated failures , learned to read and write correctly , and who , in spite of all these drawbacks , had attained the honour of a degree . "
111724	111728	111719	111720	This man	3472	" he thought , "
111734	111745	111730	111730	I	0	" It was almost too much for him to bear . "
111752	111756	111750	111750	Spavin	844	" said he ; "
111787	111788	111789	111789	Gammon	1196	" "
111791	111796	111789	111789	Gammon	1196	" said Mr. Spavin . "
111815	111816	111811	111811	I	0	" "
111825	111829	111817	111817	I	0	" Pen said . "
111841	111848	111849	111849	You	844	" Spavin said . Pen winced . "
111913	112234	112235	112236	Good evens	4953	" - and in this way Pen found himself in Mr. Spavin 's postchaise , and rode with that gentleman as far as the Ram Inn at Mudford , fifteen miles from Oxbridge ; where the Fenbury mail changed horses , and where Pen got a place on to London . The next day there was an immense excitement in Boniface College , Oxbridge , where , for some time , a rumour prevailed , to the terror of Pen 's tutor and tradesmen , that Pendennis , maddened at losing his degree , had made away with himself - a battered cap , in which his name was almost discernible , together with a seal bearing his crest of an eagle looking at a now extinct sun , had been found three miles on the Fenbury road , near a mill - stream , and , for four - and - twenty hours , it was supposed that poor Pen had flung himself into the stream , until letters arrived from him , bearing the London post - mark . The mail reached London at the dreary hour of five ; and he hastened to the inn at Covent Garden , at which he was accustomed to put up , where the ever - wakeful porter admitted him , and showed him to a bed . Pen looked hard at the man , and wondered whether Boots knew he was plucked ? When in bed be could not sleep there . He tossed about until the appearance of the dismal London daylight , when he sprang up desperately , and walked off to his uncle 's lodgings in Bury Street ; where the maid , who was scouring the steps , looked up suspiciously at him , as he came with an unshaven face , and yesterday 's linen . He thought she knew of his mishap , too . "
112247	112287	112238	112239	Mr. Harthur	1198	" Mr. Morgan , the valet , asked , who had just arranged the well - brushed clothes and shiny boots at the door of his master 's bedroom , and was carrying in his wig to the Major . "
112295	112358	112288	112288	I	0	" he cried , in a ghastly voice , and flung himself down on a chair . Morgan backed before the pale and desperate - looking young man , with terrified and wondering glances , and disappeared in his master 's apartment . The Major put his head out of the bedroom door , as soon as he had his wig on . "
112383	112389	112374	112376	the old gentleman	15207	" and the head disappeared . "
112398	112402	112405	112405	they	4959	" groaned Pen ; "
112412	112553	112405	112405	they	4959	" Pen had been standing with his back to the window , and to such a dubious light as Bury Street enjoys of a foggy January morning , so that his uncle could not see the expression of the young man 's countenance , or the looks of gloom and despair which even Mr. Morgan had remarked . But when the Major came out of his dressing - room neat and radiant , and preceded by faint odours from Delcroix 's shop , from which emporium Major Pendennis 's wig and his pocket - handkerchief got their perfume , he held out one of his hands to Pen , and was about addressing him in his cheery high - toned voice , when he caught sight of the boy 's face at length , and dropping his hand , said , "
112564	112565	112557	112557	Pen	799	" "
112578	112582	112566	112566	You	4960	" Pen said . "
112586	112587	112588	112588	My	0	" "
112596	112597	112594	112594	sir	2261	" "
112606	112614	112615	112615	I	0	" asked the Major , more perplexed . "
112622	112627	112615	112615	I	0	" Pen groaned out ; "
112646	112647	112638	112638	I	0	" "
112652	112658	112638	112638	I	0	" screamed out the Major . "
112675	112688	112668	112668	you	0	" Pen laughed bitterly at the word feather , and repeated it . "
112728	112759	112720	112720	I	0	" The Major had heard of plucking , but in a very vague and cursory way , and concluded that it was some ceremony performed corporally upon rebellious university youth . "
112776	112780	112762	112762	you	2261	" he said ; "
112791	112792	112793	112793	I	0	" "
112820	112821	112815	112815	I	0	" "
112833	112838	112831	112831	sir	2261	" the Major said . "
112841	112842	112831	112831	sir	2261	" "
112848	112972	112973	112973	Me	0	" asked the guardian , looking Pen anxiously in the face . Pen perceived the error under which his guardian was labouring , and in the midst of his misery the blunder caused the poor wretch a faint smile , and served to bring down the conversation from the tragedy - key , in which Pen had been disposed to carry it on . He explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination , and failed . On which the Major said , that though he had expected far better things of his nephew , there was no great misfortune in this , and no dishonour as far as he saw , and that Pen must try again . "
112978	112982	112973	112973	Me	0	" Pen thought , "
112990	113235	112973	112973	Me	0	" He felt that , except he went down to burn the place , he could not enter it . But it was when he came to tell his uncle of his debts that the other felt surprise and anger most keenly , and broke out in speeches most severe upon Pen , which the lad bore , as best might , without flinching . He had determined to make a clean breast , and had formed a full , true , and complete list of all his bills and liabilities at the university , and in London . They consisted of various items , such as : London Tailor . Oxbridge do . Oxbridge do . Bill for horses . Haberdasher , for shirts and gloves . Printseller . Jeweller . Books . College Cook . Binding . Grump , for desserts . Hairdresser and Perfumery . Bootmaker . Hotel bill in London . Wine Merchant in London . Sundries . All which items the reader may fill in at his pleasure - such accounts have been inspected by the parents of many university youth , - and it appeared that Mr. Pen 's bills in all amounted to about seven hundred pounds ; and , furthermore , it was calculated that he had had more than twice that sum of ready money during his stay at Oxbridge . This sum he had spent , and for it had to show - what ? "
113248	113257	113246	113246	sir	2261	" Pen said to his uncle , gloomily . "
113285	113294	113283	113283	sir	2261	" he continued , with his voice failing ; "
113314	113315	113308	113308	her	2288	" "
113322	113327	113317	113317	you	2261	" the Major said . "
113448	113548	113550	113550	their	4979	" And pulling on his hat , and trembling in his limbs somewhat , Major Pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew , and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the Club . He saw the Oxbridge examination - lists in the morning papers , and read over the names , not understanding the business , with mournful accuracy . He consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance , in the course of the day , at his Clubs ; Wenham , a Dean , various Civilians ; and , as it is called , "
113553	113760	113550	113550	their	4979	" showing to some of them the amount of his nephew 's debts , which he had dotted down on the back of a card , and asking what was to be done , and whether such debts were not monstrous , preposterous ? What was to be done ? - There was nothing for it but to pay . Wenham and the others told the Major of young men who owed twice as much - five times as much - as Arthur , and with no means at all to pay . The consultations , and calculations , and opinions , comforted the Major somewhat . After all , he was not to pay . But he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew , of the sacrifices which he had made , and of the manner in which he was disappointed . And he wrote off a letter to Doctor Portman , informing him of the direful events which had taken place , and begging the Doctor to break them to Helen . For the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things , and was of opinion that it was more correct to "
113762	113855	113550	113550	their	4979	" a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger , than to convey it simply to its destination by a note . So the Major wrote to Doctor Portman , and then went out to dinner , one of the saddest men in any London dining - room that day . Pen , too , wrote his letter , and skulked about London streets for the rest of the day , fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour , "
113867	115417	113858	113860	Pendennis of Boniface	1151	" His letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse : he wept the bitterest tears over it - and the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree . He saw a party of roaring young blades from Oxbridge in the coffee - room of his hotel , and slunk away from them , and paced the streets . He remembers , he says , the prints which he saw hanging up at Ackermann 's window in the rain , and a book which he read at a stall near the Temple : at night he went to the pit of the play , and saw Miss Fotheringay , but he does n't in the least recollect in what piece . On the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor , containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him , but strongly urging Pen not to take his name off the university books , and to retrieve a disaster which , everybody knew , was owing to his own carelessness alone , and which he might repair by a month 's application . He said he had ordered Pen 's skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentleman 's wardrobe , which duly arrived with fresh copies of all Pen 's bills laid on the top . On the third day there arrived a letter from home ; which Pen read in his bedroom , and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes , and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself ; and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the Bull and Mouth , Piccadilly , by the Chatteris coach for that evening . CHAPTER XXII Prodigal 's Return Such a letter as the Major wrote of course , sent Doctor Portman to Fairoaks , and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit . He wishes the deed were done , and done quickly . He is sorry , but que voulez - vous ? the tooth must be taken out , and he has you in the chair , and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps . Perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth ; but , in fine , it is your duty to have it out . So the doctor , having read the epistle out to Myra and Mrs. Portman , with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition , left those ladies to spread the news through the Clavering society , which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch , and strode over to Fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow . She had the news already . She had read Pen 's letter , and it had relieved her somehow . A gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many , many months past . She knew the worst now , and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tender - hearted . Did she want more ? All that the Rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by common - sense , and made respectable by antiquity could not bring Helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness , except that the boy should be unhappy . What was this degree that they made such an outcry about , and what good would it do Pen ? Why did Doctor Portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked , and so little good to be won ? Why did n't they leave him at home with his mother ? As for his debts , of course they must be paid ; - his debts ! - was n't his father 's money all his , and had n't he a right to spend it ? In this way the widow met the virtuous Doctor , and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom . For some time past , an agreeable practice , known since times ever so ancient , by which brothers and sisters are wo nt to exhibit their affection towards one another , and in which Pen and his little sister Laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days , had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals . Coming back from college after an absence from home of some months , in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him , Mr. Arthur found a tall , slim , handsome young lady , to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously , and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand , and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek , just upon the very spot which young Pen had been used to salute . I am not good at descriptions of female beauty ; and , indeed , do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are , of course , far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face , and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of Miss Laura Bell at the age of sixteen years . At that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches , so that she was called tall and gawky by some , and a Maypole by others , of her own sex , who prefer littler women . But if she was a Maypole , she had beautiful roses about her head , and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her . She was ordinarily pale , with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks ; but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called , and continued so blushing ever so long , the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence . Her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood , and retained that characteristic in later life . Good - natured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes , and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company ; but the fact is , that Nature had made them so to shine and to look , and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another . It was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that Miss Laura 's eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes , so that , when she closed her eyes , the same people who found fault with those orbs , said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off ; and , indeed , I daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight . As for her complexion , that was nearly as brilliant as Lady Mantrap 's , and without the powder which her ladyship uses . Her nose must be left to the reader 's imaginaton : if her mouth was rather large as Miss Piminy avers , who , but for her known appetite , one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming , and showed off a set of pearly teeth , whilst her voice was so low and sweet , that to hear it was like listening to sweet music . Because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses , people of course say that her feet are not small : but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure , and it does not follow , because Mrs. Pincher is always putting her foot out , that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis . In fine , Miss Laura Bell at the age of sixteen , was a sweet young lady . Many thousands of such are to be found , let us hope , in this country where there is no lack of goodness , and modesty , and purity , and beauty . Now Miss Laura , since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with Pen 's general conduct and bearing . His letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short . It was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant Arthur 's occupations and studies were and how many his engagements . "
115427	115430	113858	113860	Pendennis of Boniface	1151	" Laura said "
115491	115492	115488	115488	you	4982	" "
115500	116055	115498	115498	Laura	799	" sighed out Mrs. Pendennis . Laura declared stoutly that she did not love Pen a bit , when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of Helen 's fond arguments , that the boy must make his way in the world ; that his uncle was most desirous that Pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life ; that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand , and so forth . Perhaps Helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did ; but she tried to believe that she believed them , and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation . And that is a point whereon I suppose many a gentleman has reflected , that , do what we will , we are pretty sure of the woman 's love that once has been ours ; and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us . Also , there had been that freedom , not to say audacity , in Arthur 's latter talk and ways , which had shocked and displeased Laura . Not that he ever offended her by rudeness , or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear , for Mr. Pen was a gentleman , and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low ; but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general ; was less courteous in his actions than in his words - neglectful in sundry ways , and in many of the little offices of life . It offended Miss Laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house ; that he should refuse to go to church with his mother , or on walks or visits with her , and be found yawning over his novel in his dressing - gown , when the gentle widow returned from those duties . The hero of Laura 's early infancy , about whom she had passed so many , many nights talking with Helen who recited endless stories of the boy 's virtues , and love , and bravery , when he was away at school , was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew ; bold and brilliant , sarcastic and defiant , seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures , or even devotions , of the women with whom he lived , and whom he quitted on such light pretexts . The Fotheringay affair , too , when Laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of Major Pendennis , when on a visit to Fairoaks , and then from their neighbours at Clavering , who had plenty of information to give her on this head , vastly shocked and outraged Miss Laura . A Pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that ! Helen 's boy galloping away from home , day after day , to fall on his knees to an actress , and drink with her horrid father ! A good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house , and set her over his mother ! "
116078	116082	116068	116068	I	0	" Laura said . "
116093	117086	116084	116084	you	4988	" Helen answered ; on which , of course , Laura withdrew her previous observation , and the two women rushed into each other 's embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures , and which characterises not a few of their sex . Whence came all Whence came all the indignation of Miss Laura about Arthur 's passion ? Perhaps she did not know , that , if men throw themselves away upon women , women throw themselves away upon men , too ; and that there is no more accounting for love , than for any other physical liking or antipathy : perhaps she had been misinformed by the Clavering people and old Mrs. Portman , who was vastly bitter against Pen , especially since his impertinent behaviour to the Doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in church - time : perhaps , finally , she was jealous ; but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge . Albeit she was angry with Pen , against his mother she had no such feeling ; but devoted herself to Helen with the utmost force of her girlish affection - such affection as women , whose hearts are disengaged , are apt to bestow upon the near female friend . It was devotion - it was passion - it was all sorts of fondness and folly ; it was a profusion of caresses , tender epithets and endearments , such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate . Do not let us men despise these instincts because we can not feel them . These women were made for our comfort and delectation , gentlemen , - with all the rest of the minor animals . But as soon as Miss Laura heard that Pen was unfortunate and unhappy , all her wrath against him straightway vanished , and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion . He was the Pen of old days once more restored to her , the frank and affectionate , the generous and tender - hearted . She at once took side with Helen against Doctor Portman , when he outcried at the enormity of Pen 's transgressions . Debts ? what were his debts ? they were a trifle ; he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncle 's order , and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented . Disgraced by not getting his degree ? the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations : he could n't think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him ; very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him , and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head . Other people disliked him , and were cruel to him , and were unfair to him , she was very sure . And so , with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger , this young creature reasoned ; and she went up and seized Helen 's hand , and kissed her in the Doctor 's presence , and her looks braved the Doctor , and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mother 's Pen ? When that divine took his leave , not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women , Laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to Helen , who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter . There must be some jealousy against Pen . She felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners , who had taken a mean revenge of him - nothing more likely . Altogether , the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed . Pen , who was plunged in his shame and grief in London , and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mother 's sorrow , would have wondered , had he seen how easily she bore the calamity . Indeed , calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again : and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust , depend upon it that she wo n't repine , and only take a very little bit of it for herself , provided you will eat the remainder in her company . And directly the Doctor was gone , Laura ordered fires to be lighted in Mr. Arthur 's rooms , and his bedding to be aired ; and had these preparations completed by the time Helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to Pen : when the girl , smiling fondly , took her mamma by the hand , and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully , and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed , and talked about Pen ever so long . Laura added a postscript to Helen 's letter , in which she called him her dearest Pen , and bade him come home instantly , with two of the handsomest dashes under the word , and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister Laura . In the middle of the night - as these two ladies , after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening , and after taking just a look into Pen 's room as they passed to their own - in the middle of the night , I say , Laura , whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late Pendennis had been accustomed to press , cried out suddenly , "
117093	117099	117090	117090	you	1205	" Helen stirred and said , "
117106	117244	117248	117248	mamma	4982	" The truth is , though she had been lying quite still and silent , she had not been asleep one instant , but had been looking at the night - lamp in the chimney , and had been thinking of Pen for hours and hours . Then Miss Laura who had been acting with similar hypocrisy , and lying , occupied with her own thoughts , as motionless as Helen 's brooch , with Pen 's and Laura 's hair in it , on the frilled white pincushion on the dressing - table began to tell Mrs. Pendennis of a notable plan which she had been forming in her busy little brains ; and by which all Pen 's embarrassments would be made to vanish in a moment , and without the least trouble to anybody . "
117250	117256	117248	117248	mamma	4982	" this young lady said , "
117470	117793	117795	117798	garner and stable man	4996	" What Helen replied to this speech need not be repeated , as the widow 's answer was made up of a great number of incoherent ejaculations , embraces , and other irrelative matter . But the two women slept well after that talk ; and when the night - lamp went out with a splutter , and the sun rose gloriously over the purple hills , and the birds began to sing and pipe cheerfully amidst the leafless trees and glistening evergreens on Fairoaks lawn , Helen woke too , and as she looked at the sweet face of the girl sleeping beside her , her lips parted with a smile , blushes on her cheeks , her spotless bosom heaving and falling with gentle undulations , as if happy dreams were sweeping over it - Pen 's mother felt happy and grateful beyond all power of words , save such as pious women offer up to the Beneficent Dispenser of love and mercy - in Whose honour a chorus of such praises is constantly rising up all round the world . Although it was January and rather cold weather , so sincere was Mr. Pen 's remorse , and so determined his plans of economy , that he would not take an inside place in the coach , but sate up behind with his friend the Guard , who remembered his former liberality , and lent him plenty of great - coats . Perhaps it was the cold that made his knees tremble as he got down at the lodge - gate , or it may be that he was agitated at the notion of seeing the kind creature for whose love he had made so selfish a return . Old John was in waiting to receive his master 's baggage , but he appeared in a fustian jacket , and no longer wore his livery of drab and blue . "
117807	120706	117795	117798	garner and stable man	4996	" this worthy man remarked , with a grin of welcome to Pen , and something of a blush ; but instantly as Pen turned the corner of the shrubbery and was out of eye - shot of the coach , Helen made her appearance , her face beaming with love and forgiveness - for forgiving is what some women love best of all . We may be sure that the widow , having a certain other object in view , had lost no time in writing off to Pen an account of the noble , the magnanimous , the magnificent offer of Laura , filling up her letter with a profusion of benedictions upon both her children . It was probably the knowledge of this money - obligation which caused Pen to blush very much when he saw Laura , who was in waiting in the hall , and who this time , and for this time only , broke through the little arrangement of which we have spoken , as having subsisted between her and Arthur for the last few years ; but the truth is , there has been a great deal too much said about kissing in the present chapter . So the Prodigal came home , and the fatted calf was killed for him , and he was made as happy as two simple women could make him . No allusions were made to the Oxbridge mishap , or questions asked as to his farther proceedings , for some time . But Pen debated these anxiously in his own mind , and up in his own room , where he passed much time in cogitation . A few days after he came home , he rode to Chatteris on his horse , and came back on the top of the coach . He then informed his mother that he had left the horse to be sold ; and when that operation was effected , he handed her over the cheque , which she , and possibly Pen himself , thought was an act of uncommon virtue and self - denial , but which Laura pronounced to be only strict justice . He rarely mentioned the loan which she had made , and which , indeed , had been accepted by the widow with certain modifications ; but once or twice , and with great hesitation and stammering , he alluded to it , and thanked her ; but it evidently pained his vanity to be beholden to the orphan for succour . He was wild to find some means of repaying her . He left off drinking wine , and betook himself , but with great moderation , to the refreshment of whisky - and - water . He gave up cigar - smoking ; but it must be confessed that of late years he had liked pipes and tobacco as well or even better , so that this sacrifice was not a very severe one . He fell asleep a great deal after dinner when he joined the ladies in the drawing - room , and was certainly very moody and melancholy . He watched the coaches with great interest , walked in to read the papers at Clavering assiduously , dined with anybody who would ask him and the widow was glad that he should have any entertainment in their solitary place , and played a good deal at cribbage with Captain Glanders . He avoided Dr. Portman , who , in his turn , whenever Pen passed , gave him very severe looks from under his shovel - hat . He went to church with his mother , however , very regularly , and read prayers for her at home to the little household . Always humble , it was greatly diminished now : a couple of maids did the work of the house of Fairoaks : the silver dish - covers never saw the light at all . John put on his livery to go to church , and assert his dignity on Sundays , but it was only for form 's sake . He was gardener and out - door man , vice Upton , resigned . There was but little fire in Fairoaks kitchen , and John and the maids drank their evening beer there by the light , of a single candle . All this was Mr. Pen 's doing , and the state of things did not increas his cheerfulness . For some time Pen said no power on earth could induce him to go back to Oxbridge again , after his failure there ; but one day Laura said to him , with many blushes , that she thought , as some sort of reparation , of punishment on himself for his - for his idleness , he ought to go back and get his degree , if he could fetch it by doing so ; and so back Mr. Pen went . A plucked man is a dismal being in a university ; belonging to no set of men there , and owned by no one . Pen felt himself plucked indeed of all the fine feathers which he had won during his brilliant years , and rarely appeared out of his college ; regularly going to morning chapel , and shutting himself up in his rooms of nights , away from the noise and suppers of the undergraduates . There were no duns about his door , they were all paid - scarcely any cards were left there . The men of his year had taken their degrees , and were gone . He went into a second examination , and passed with perfect ease . He was somewhat more easy in his mind when he appeared in his bachelor 's gown . On his way back from Oxbridge he paid a visit to his uncle in London ; but the old gentleman received him with very cold looks , and would scarcely give him his forefinger to shake . He called a second time , but Morgan , the valet , said his master was from home . Pen came back to Fairoaks , and to his books and to his idleness , and loneliness and despair . He commenced several tragedies , and wrote many copies of verses of a gloomy cast . He formed plans of reading and broke them . He thought about enlisting - about the Spanish legion - about a profession . He chafed against his captivity , and cursed the idleness which had caused it . Helen said he was breaking his heart , and was sad to see his prostration . As soon as they could afford it , he should go abroad - he should go to London - he should be freed from the dull society of two poor women . It was dull - very , certainly . The tender widow 's habitual melancholy seemed to deepen into a sadder gloom ; and Laura saw with alarm that the dear friend became every year more languid and weary , and that her pale cheek grew more wan . CHAPTER XXIII New Faces The inmates of Fairoaks were drowsily pursuing this humdrum existence , while the great house upon the hill , on the other side of the River Brawl , was shaking off the slumber in which it had lain during the lives of two generations of masters , and giving extraordinary signs of renewed liveliness . Just about the time of Pen 's little mishap , and when he was so absorbed in the grief occasioned by that calamity as to take no notice of events which befell persons less interesting to himself than Arthur Pendennis , an announcement appeared in the provincial journals which caused no small sensation in the county at least , and in all the towns , villages , halls and mansions , and parsonages for many miles round Clavering Park . At Clavering Market ; at Cackleby Fair ; at Chatteris Sessions ; on Gooseberry Green , as the squire 's carriage met the vicar 's one - horse contrivance , and the inmates of both vehicles stopped on the road to talk ; at Tinkleton Church gate , as the bell was tolling in the sunshine , and the white smocks and scarlet cloaks came trooping over the green common , to Sunday worship ; in a hundred societies round about - the word was , that Clavering Park was to be inhabited again . Some five years before , the county papers had advertised the marriage at Florence , at the British Legation , of Francis Clavering , Esq . , only son of Sir Francis Clavering , Bart . , of Clavering Park , with Jemima Augusta , daughter of Samuel Snell , of Calcutta , Esq . , and widow of the late J. Amory , Esq . At that time the legend in the county was that Clavering , who had been ruined for many a year , had married a widow from India with some money . Some of the county folks caught a sight of the newly - married pair . The Kickleburys , travelling in Italy , had seen them . Clavering occupied the Poggi Palace at Florence , gave parties , and lived comfortably - but could never come to England . Another year - young Peregrine , of Cackleby , making a Long Vacation tour , had fallen in with the Claverings occupying Schloss Schinkenstein , on the Mummel See . At Rome , at Lucca , at Nice , at the baths and gambling places of the Rhine and Belgium , this worthy couple might occasionally be heard of by the curious , and rumours of them came , as it were by gusts , to Clavering 's ancestral place . Their last place of abode was Paris , where they appear to have lived in great fashion and splendour after the news of the death of Samuel Snell , Esq . , of Calcutta , reached his orphan daughter in Europe . Of Sir Francis Clavering 's antecedents little can be said that would be advantageous to that respected baronet . The son of an outlaw , living in a dismal old chateau near Bruges , this gentleman had made a feeble attempt to start in life with a commission in a dragoon regiment , and had broken down almost at the outset . Transactions at the gambling - table had speedily effected his ruin ; after a couple of years in the army he had been forced to sell out , had passed some time in Her Majesty 's prison of the Fleet , and had then shipped over to Ostend to join the gouty exile , his father . And in Belgium , France and Germany , for some years , this decayed and abortive prodigal might be seen lurking about billiard - rooms and watering - places , punting at gambling - houses , dancing at boarding - house balls , and riding steeple - chases on other folks ' horses . It was at a boarding - house at Lausanne that Francis Clavering made what he called the lucky coup of marrying the widow Amory , very lately returned from Calcutta . His father died soon after , by consequence of whose demise his wife became Lady Clavering . The title so delighted Mr. Snell of Calcutta , that he doubled his daughter 's allowance ; and dying himself soon after , left a fortune to her and her children the amount of which was , if not magnified by rumour , something very splendid indeed . Before this time there had been , not rumours unfavourable to Lady Clavering 's reputation , but unpleasant impressions regarding her ladyship . The best English people abroad were shy of making her acquaintance ; her manners were not the most refined ; her origin was lamentably low and doubtful . The retired East Indians , who are to be found in considerable force in most of the continental towns frequented by English , spoke with much scorn of the disreputable old lawyer and indigo - smuggler her father , and of Amory , her first husband , who had been mate of the Indiaman in which Miss Snell came out to join her father at Calcutta . Neither father nor daughter were in society at Calcutta , or had ever been heard of at Government House . Old Sir Jasper Rogers , who had been Chief Justice of Calcutta , had once said to his wife , that he could tell a queer story about Lady Clavering 's first husband ; but greatly to Lady Rogers 's disappointment , and that of the young ladies his daughters , the old Judge could never be got to reveal that mystery . They were all , however , glad enough to go to Lady Clavering 's parties , when her ladyship took the Hotel Bouilli in the Rue Grenelle at Paris , and blazed out in the polite world there in the winter of 183 - . The Faubourg St. Germain took her up . Viscount Bagwig , our excellent ambassador , paid her marked attention . The princes of the family frequented her salons . The most rigid and noted of the English ladies resident in the French capital acknowledged and countenanced her ; the virtuous Lady Elderbury , the severe Lady Rockminster , the venerable Countess of Southdown - people , in a word , renowned for austerity , and of quite a dazzling moral purity : - so great and beneficent an influence had the possession of ten some said twenty thousand a year exercised upon Lady Clavering 's character and reputation . And her munificence and good - will were unbounded . Anybody in society who had a scheme of charity was sure to find her purse open . The French ladies of piety got money from her to support their schools and convents ; she subscribed indifferently for the Armenian patriarch ; for Father Barbarossa , who came to Europe to collect funds for his monastery on Mount Athos ; for the Baptist Mission to Quashyboo , and the Orthodox Settlement in Feefawfoo , the largest and most savage of the Cannibal Islands . And it is on record of her , that , on the same day on which Madame de Cricri got five Napoleons from her in support of the poor persecuted Jesuits , who were at that time in very bad odour in France , Lady Budelight put her down in her subscription - list for the Rev. J. Ramshorn , who had had a vision which ordered him to convert the Pope of Rome . And more than this , and for the benefit of the worldly , her ladyship gave the best dinners , and the grandest balls and suppers , which were known at Paris during that season . And it was during this time , that the good - natured lady must have arranged matters with her husband 's creditors in England , for Sir Francis reappeared in his native country , without fear of arrest ; was announced in the Morning Post , and the county paper , as having taken up his residence at Mivart 's Hotel ; and one day the anxious old housekeeper at Clavering House beheld a carriage and four horses drive up the long avenue , and stop before the moss - grown steps in front of the vast melancholy portico . Three gentlemen were in the carriage - an open one . On the back seat was our old acquaintance , Mr. Tatham of Chatteris , whilst in the places of honour sate a handsome and portly gentleman enveloped in mustachios , whiskers , fur collars , and braiding , and by him a pale languid man who descended feebly from the carriage , when the little lawyer , and the gentleman in fur , nimbly jumped out of it . They walked up the great moss - grown steps to the hall - door , and a foreign attendant , with earrings and a gold - laced cap , pulled strenuously at the great bell - handle at the cracked and sculptured gate . The bell was heard clanging loudly through the vast gloomy mansion . Steps resounded presently upon the marble pavement of the hall within ; and the doors opened , and finally Mrs. Blenkinsop , the housekeeper , Polly , her aide - de - camp , and Smart , the keeper , appeared bowing humbly . Smart , the keeper , pulled the wisp of hay - coloured hair which adorned his sunburnt forehead , kicked out his left heel as if there were a dog biting at his calves , and brought down his head to a bow . Old Mrs Blenkinsop dropped a curtsey . Little Polly , her aide - de - camp , made a curtsey and several rapid bows likewise ; and Mrs. Blenkinsop , with a great deal of emotion , quavered out , "
120729	120773	120774	120774	You	5000	" The speech and the greetings were all addressed to the grand gentleman in fur and braiding , who wore his hat so magnificently on one side , and twirled his mustachios so royally . But he burst out laughing , and said , "
120810	120825	120806	120808	your rightful lord	5006	" And he pointed his hand towards the pale , languid gentleman who said , "
120833	120834	120837	120838	Mrs. Blenkinsop	1223	" "
120863	120924	120855	120855	I	0	" and he took the old lady 's trembling hand ; and nodded in her astonished face , in a not unkind manner . Mrs. Blenkinsop declared upon her conscience that she would have known Sir Francis anywhere , that he was the very image of Sir Francis , his father , and of Sir John who had gone before . "
120943	120953	120855	120855	I	0	" Sir Francis said , looking vacantly about the hall "
120983	121004	121010	121010	Ned	1225	" Dismal ? - beautiful ! - the Castle of Otranto ! - the Mysteries of Udolpho , by Jove ! "
121012	121046	121010	121010	Ned	1225	" What a fireplace ! You might roast an elephant in it . Splendid carved gallery ! Inigo Jones , by Jove ! I 'd lay five to two it 's Inigo Jones . "
121047	121081	121083	121084	the housekeeper	18010	" The upper part by Inigo Jones ; the lower was altered by the eminent Dutch architect , Vanderputty , in George the First his time , by Sir Richard , fourth baronet , "
121086	121090	121092	121093	the Baronet	15718	" O indeed , "
121094	121103	121010	121010	Ned	1225	" Gad , Ned , you know everything . "
121104	121113	121114	121114	Ned	1225	" I know a few things , Frank , "
121117	121176	121114	121114	Ned	1225	" I know that 's not a Snyders over the mantelpiece - bet you three to one it 's a copy . We 'll restore it , my boy . A lick of varnish , and it will come out wonderfully , sir . That old fellow in the red gown , I suppose , is Sir Richard . "
121177	121194	121196	121197	the housekeeper	18010	" Sheriff of the county , and sate in parliament in the reign of Queen Anne , "
121206	121289	121196	121197	the housekeeper	18010	" that on the right is Theodosia , wife of Harbottle , second baronet , by Lely , represented in the character of Venus , the Goddess of Beauty , - her son Gregory , the third baronet , by her side , as Cupid , God of Love , with a bow and arrows ; that on the next panel is Sir Rupert , made a knight banneret by Charles the First , and whose property was confuscated by Oliver Cromwell . "
121290	121302	121304	121305	the Baronet	15718	" Thank you - need n't go on , Mrs. Blenkinsop , "
121307	121330	121304	121305	the Baronet	15718	" We 'll walk about the place ourselves . Frosch , give me a cigar . Have a cigar , Mr. Tatham ? "
121354	121416	121349	121350	the lawyer	14397	" Need n't come with us , Mrs. Blenkinsop . What 's - his - name - you - Smart - feed the horses and wash their mouths . Sha n't stay long . Come along , Strong , - I know the way : I was here in twenty - thwee , at the end of my gwandfather 's time . "
121771	121784	121786	121787	the Captain	14344	" I see capabilities in it - capabilities in it , sir , "
121789	121948	121786	121787	the Captain	14344	" Gad , sir , leave it to me , and I 'll make it the pride of the country , at a small expense . What a theatre we can have in the library here , the curtains between the columns which divide the room ! What a famous room for a galop ! - it will hold the whole shire . We 'll hang the morning parlour with the tapestry in your second salon in the Rue de Grenelle , and furnish the oak room with the Moyen - age cabinets and the armour . Armour looks splendid against black oak , and there 's a Venice glass in the Quai Voltaire , which will suit that high mantelpiece to an inch , sir . The long saloon , white and crimson of course ; the drawing - room yellow satin ; and the little drawing - room light blue , with lace over - hay ? "
121949	121962	121963	121964	Sir Francis	693	" I recollect my old governor caning me in that little room , "
121968	121978	121963	121964	Sir Francis	693	" he always hated me , my old governor . "
121979	122036	121786	121787	the Captain	14344	" Chintz is the dodge , I suppose , for my lady 's rooms - the suite in the landing , to the south , the bedroom , the sitting - room , and the dressing - room . We 'll throw a conservatory out , over the balcony . Where will you have your rooms ? "
122037	122045	122047	122048	the Baronet	15718	" Put mine in the north wing , "
122054	122081	122047	122048	the Baronet	15718	" and out of the reach of Miss Amory 's confounded piano . I ca n't bear it . She 's scweeching from morning till night . "
122188	122201	122184	122185	the Baronet	15718	" D - - the gardens , and that sort of thing ! "
122332	122348	122349	122349	Laura	799	" Mrs. Pybus says there is a very pretty girl in the family , Arthur , "
122366	122396	122349	122349	Laura	799	" a Miss Amory , Lady Clavering 's daughter by her first marriage . Of course , you will fall in love with her as soon as she arrives . "
122401	122409	122410	122410	Pen	799	" Do n't talk nonsense , Laura . "
122416	122428	122410	122410	Pen	799	" Well , there is the young Sir Francis for you . "
122429	122437	122438	122439	Miss Laura	741	" He is but four years old , "
122442	122476	122438	122439	Miss Laura	741	" But I shall console myself with that handsome officer , Sir Francis 's friend . He was at church last Sunday , in the Clavering pew , and his mustachios were beautiful . "
122837	122854	122824	122824	he	14344	" Tu be sure he be a vine veller , tu be sure that he be , "
122990	122999	123000	123000	he	14344	" I am a creature born for society , "
123005	123109	123000	123000	he	14344	" I 'm down here to see Clavering 's house set in order ; for between ourselves , Frank has no energy , sir , no energy ; he 's not the chest for it , sir and he threw out his own trunk as he spoke ; but I must have social intercourse . Old Mrs. Blenkinsop goes to bed at seven , and takes Polly with her . There was nobody but me and the Ghost for the first two nights at the great house , and I own it , sir , I like company . Most old soldiers do . "
123142	123258	123259	123259	he	5139	" I began , sir , as cadet of Hungarian Uhlans , and when the war of Greek independence broke out , quitted that service in consequence of a quarrel with my governor , and was one of seven who escaped from Missolonghi , and was blown up in one of Botzaris 's fireships , at the age of seventeen . I 'll show you my Cross of the Redeemer , if you 'll come over to my lodgings and take a glass of grog with me , Captain , this evening . I 've a few of those baubles in my desk . I 've the White Eagle of Poland ; Skrzynecki gave it me "
123269	123435	123259	123259	he	5139	" upon the field of Ostrolenka . I was a lieutenant of the fourth regiment , sir , and we marched through Diebitsch 's lines - bang thro ' 'em into Prussia , sir , without firing a shot . Ah , Captain , that was a mismanaged business . I received this wound by the side of the King before Oporto , - where he would have pounded the stock - jobbing Pedroites , had Bourmont followed my advice ; and I served in Spain with the King 's troops , until the death of my dear friend , Zumalacarreguy , when I saw the game was over , and hung up my toasting iron , Captain . Alava offered me a regiment , the Queen 's Muleteros ; but I could n't - damme , I could n't - and now , sir , you know Ned Strong - the Chevalier Strong they call me abroad - as well as he knows himself . "
123871	123876	123877	123877	Laura	741	" And Miss Amory ? "
123891	123913	123888	123888	Strong	1225	" Oh , Miss Amory is a muse - Miss Amory is a mystery - Miss Amory is a femme incomprise . "
123914	123919	123921	123923	simple Mrs. Pendennis	697	" What is that ? "
123940	123972	123926	123927	the Chevalier	5178	" Miss Amory paints , Miss Amory writes poems , Miss Amory composes music , Miss Amory rides like Diana Vernon . Miss Amory is a paragon , in a word . "
123973	123979	123981	123981	Pen	799	" I hate clever women , "
123983	123987	123989	123989	Laura	799	" Thank you , "
125007	125012	125013	125013	he	1246	" Elle est la , "
125029	125046	125013	125013	he	1246	" Je t'ai vue , je te benis , O ma sylphide , O mon ange ! "

125495	125511	125512	125513	the Baronet	15718	" You see the little beggar 's never been to church before , Miss Bell , "
125525	125563	125512	125513	the Baronet	15718	" no wonder he should make a row : I do n't go in town neither , but I think it 's right in the country to give a good example - and that sort of thing . "
125570	125582	125564	125565	Miss Bell	741	" The little boy had not given a particularly good example . "
125583	125597	125599	125600	the Baronet	15718	" Gad , I do n't know , and that sort of thing , "
125602	125628	125599	125600	the Baronet	15718	" It ai n't so bad neither . Whenever he wants a thing , Frank always cwies , and whenever he cwies he gets it . "
125701	125708	125710	125711	Lady Clavering	693	" We do spoil him so , "
125747	125753	125760	125760	she	697	" It is very wrong , "
125773	125804	125760	125760	she	697	" Mamma says she spoils my brother , - do you think anything could , Miss Bell ? Look at him , - is n't he like a little angel ? "
125805	125813	125815	125816	the Baronet	15718	" Gad , I was quite wight , "
125818	125840	125815	125816	the Baronet	15718	" He has cwied , and he has got it , you see . Go it , Fwank , old boy . "
125841	125850	125851	125852	Miss Amory	1236	" Sir Francis is a very judicious parent , "
125912	125913	125899	125899	you	5295	" "
125917	125924	125915	125915	you	5295	" said Miss Bell , laughing . "
126004	126007	125993	125993	you	5295	" Laura said "
126010	126030	125993	125993	you	5295	" but perhaps blushed a little at the idea or the question , so that the other said , - "
126057	126058	126049	126049	I	0	" "
126064	126071	126059	126059	You	741	" said Miss Bell , smiling , "
126087	126088	126049	126049	I	0	" "
126124	126125	126122	126122	yourself	741	" "
126129	126133	126122	126122	yourself	741	" said Laura ; "
126144	126145	126141	126141	I	0	" "
126154	126155	126141	126141	I	0	" "
126163	126168	126157	126157	I	0	" Laura cried out . "
126186	126187	126188	126188	Blanche	1236	" "
126197	126198	126188	126188	Blanche	1236	" "
126332	126603	126328	126328	Blanche	1236	" - and she looked at her face and made a moue in the glass ; and never stopped for Laura 's answer to the questions which she had put . Blanche was fair , and like a sylph . She had fair hair , with green reflections in it . But she had dark eyebrows . She had long black eyelashes , which veiled beautiful brown eyes . She had such a slim waist , that it was a wonder to behold ; and such a slim little feet , that you would have thought the grass would hardly bend under them . Her lips were of the colour of faint rosebuds , and her voice warbled limpidly over a set of the sweetest little pearly teeth ever seen . She showed them very often , for they were very pretty . She was very good - natured , and a smile not only showed her teeth wonderfully , but likewise exhibited two lovely little pink dimples , that nestled in either cheek . She showed Laura her drawings , which the other thought charming . She played her some of her waltzes , with a rapid and brilliant finger , and Laura was still more charmed . And she then read her some poems , in French and English , likewise of her own composition , and which she kept locked in her own book - her own dear little book ; it was bound in blue velvet , with a gilt lock , and on it was printed in gold the title of ' Mes Larmes . ' "
126615	126704	126707	126707	Blanche	1236	" the young lady continued , who was pleased with everything that she did , and did everything very well . Laura owned that it was . She had never seen anything like it before ; anything so lovely , so accomplished , so fragile and pretty ; warbling so prettily , and tripping about such a pretty room , with such a number of pretty books , pictures , flowers , round about her . The honest and generous country girl forgot even jealousy in her admiration . "
126709	126713	126707	126707	Blanche	1236	" she said , "
126729	127344	127345	127346	Good fellow	5313	" The other smiled , looked in the glass , went up and took both of Laura 's hands , and kissed them , and sat down to the piano , and shook out a little song , as if she had been a nightingale . This was the first visit paid by Fairoaks to Clavering Park , in return for Clavering Park 's visit to Fairoaks , in reply to Fairoaks 's cards left a few days after the arrival of Sir Francis 's family . The intimacy between the young ladies sprang up like Jack 's Bean - stalk to the skies in a single night . The large footmen were perpetually walking with little rose - coloured pink notes to Fairoaks ; where there was a pretty house - maid in the kitchen , who might possibly tempt those gentlemen to so humble a place . Miss Amory sent music , or Miss Amory sent a new novel , or a picture from the ' Journal des Modes , ' to Laura ; or my lady 's compliments arrived with flowers and fruit ; or Miss Amory begged and prayed Miss Bell to come to dinner ; and dear Mrs. Pendennis , if she was strong enough ; and Mr. Arthur , if a humdrum party were not too stupid for him ; and would send a pony - carriage for Mrs. Pendennis ; and would take no denial . Neither Arthur nor Laura wished to refuse . And Helen , who was , indeed , somewhat ailing , was glad that the two should have their pleasure ; and would look at them fondly as they set forth , and ask in her heart that she might not be called away until those two beings whom she loved best in the world should be joined together . As they went out and crossed over the bridge , she remembered summer evenings five - and - twenty years ago , when she , too , had bloomed in her brief prime of love and happiness . It was all over now . The moon was looking from the purpling sky , and the stars glittering there , just as they used in the early , well - remembered evenings . He was lying dead far away , with the billows rolling between them . Good God ! how well she remembered the last look of his face as they parted . It looked out at her through the vista of long years , as sad and as clear as then . So Mr. Pen and Miss Laura found the society at Clavering Park an uncommonly agreeable resort of summer evenings . Blanche vowed that she raffoled of Laura ; and , very likely , Mr. Pen was pleased with Blanche . His spirits came back : he laughed and rattled till Laura wondered to hear him . It was not the same Pen , yawning in a shooting jacket , in the Fairoaks parlour , who appeared alert and brisk , and smiling and well dressed , in Lady Clavering 's drawing - room . Sometimes they had music . Laura had a sweet contralto voice , and sang with Blanche , who had had the best continental instruction , and was charmed to be her friend 's mistress . Sometimes Mr. Pen joined in these concerts , or oftener looked sweet upon Miss Blanche as she sang . Sometimes they had glees , when Captain Strong 's chest was of vast service , and he boomed out in a prodigious bass , of which he was not a little proud . "
127357	127365	127354	127355	Miss Bell	741	" Sir Francis would say to her . "
127449	127735	127446	127447	Miss Lauwa	1255	" And yet the Chevalier , if he lost his money to Lady Clavering , always paid it ; and if he lived with his friend for three years , paid for that too - in good - humour , in kindness and joviality , in a thousand little services by which he made himself agreeable . What gentleman could want a better friend than a man who was always in spirits , never in the way or out of it , and was ready to execute any commission for his patron , whether it was to sing a song or meet a lawyer , to fight a duel or to carve a capon ? Although Laura and Pen commonly went to Clavering Park together , yet sometimes Mr. Pen took walks there unattended by her , and about which he did not tell her . He took to fishing the Brawl , which runs through the Park , and passes not very far from the garden - wall . And by the oddest coincidence , Miss Amory would walk out having been to look at her flowers , and would be quite surprised to see Mr. Pendennis fishing . I wonder what trout Pen caught while the young lady was looking on ? or whether Miss Blanche was the pretty little fish which played round his fly , and which Mr. Pen was endeavouring to hook ? It must be owned , he became very fond of that healthful and invigorating pursuit of angling , and was whipping the Brawl continually with his fly . As for Miss Blanche she had a kind heart ; and having , as she owned , herself ' suffered "
128281	128287	128290	128291	the Baronet	15718	" I say , Strong , "
128317	128333	128290	128291	the Baronet	15718	" I say , Strong , I wish to the doose your wife was dead . "
128334	128378	128380	128381	Captain Strong	1225	" So do I. That 's a cannon , by Jove . But she wo n't ; she 'll live for ever - you see if she do n't . Why do you wish her off the hooks , Frank , my boy ? "
128383	128421	128424	128426	the other gentleman	2399	" Because then you might marry Missy . She ai n't bad - looking . She 'll have ten thousand , and that 's a good bit of money for such a poor old devil as you , "
128428	128458	128424	128426	the other gentleman	2399	" And gad , Strong , I hate her worse and worse every day . I ca n't stand her , Strong , by gad , I ca n't . "
128459	128470	128471	128472	Captain Strong	1225	" I would n't take her at twice the figure , "
128477	128489	128471	128472	Captain Strong	1225	" I never saw such a little devil in my life . "
128490	128498	128500	128502	the sententious Baronet	5348	" I should like to poison her , "
128504	128510	128500	128502	the sententious Baronet	5348	" by Jove I should , "
128511	128521	128523	128524	his friend	14540	" Why , what has she been at now ? "
128526	128530	128532	128533	Sir Francis	693	" Nothing particular , "
128535	128654	128532	128533	Sir Francis	693	" only her old tricks . That girl has such a knack of making everybody miserable that , hang me , it 's quite surprising . Last night she sent the governess crying away from the dinner - table . Afterwards , as I was passing Frank 's room , I heard the poor little beggar howling in the dark , and found his sister had been frightening his soul out of his body , by telling him stories about the ghost that 's in the house . At lunch she gave my lady a turn ; and though my wife 's a fool , she 's a good soul - I 'm hanged if she ai n't . "
128655	128663	128664	128664	Strong	1225	" What did Missy do to her ? "
128667	128687	128688	128689	the Baronet	15718	" Why , hang me , if she did n't begin talking about the late Amory , my predecessor , "
128696	128800	128688	128689	the Baronet	15718	" She got some picture out of the Keepsake , and said she was sure it was like her dear father , She wanted to know where her father 's grave was . Hang her father ! Whenever Miss Amory talks about him , Lady Clavering always bursts out crying : and the little devil will talk about him in order to spite her mother . Today when she began , I got in a confounded rage ; said I was her father ; and - and that sort of thing , and then , sir , she took a shy at me . "
128801	128812	128813	128814	Mr. Strong	1260	" And what did she say about you , Frank ? "
128826	128876	128813	128814	Mr. Strong	1260	" Gad , she said I was n't her father ; that I was n't fit to comprehend her ; that her father must have been a man of genius , and fine feelings , and that sort of thing : whereas I had married her mother for money . "
128877	128884	128886	128886	Strong	1260	" Well , did n't you ? "
128888	128909	128910	128912	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" It do n't make it any the pleasanter to hear because it 's true , do n't you know , "
128915	128989	128910	128912	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" I ai n't a literary man and that ; but I ai n't such a fool as she makes me out . I do n't know how it is , but she always manages to put me in the hole , do n't you understand . She turns all the house round her in her quiet way , and with her confounded sentimental airs . I wish she was dead , Ned . "
128990	129002	129003	129003	Strong	1225	" It was my wife whom you wanted dead just now , "
129024	129055	129015	129016	the Baron	5353	" Well ; when people bore my life out , I do wish they were dead , and I wish Missy were down a well , with all my heart . "
131000	131061	131062	131064	the dear Blanche	5479	" I should send you away , Pincott , for you are a great deal too weak , and your eyes are failing you , and you are always crying and snivelling and wanting the doctor ; but I wish that your parents at home should be supported , and I go on enduring you for their sake , mind , "
131075	131114	131062	131064	the dear Blanche	5479	" Pincott , your wretched appearance and slavish manner , and red eyes , positively give me the migraine ; and I think I shall make you wear rouge , so that you may look a little cheerful ; "
131117	131166	131062	131064	the dear Blanche	5479	" Pincott , I ca n't bear , even for the sake of your starving parents , that you should tear my hair out of my head in that manner ; and I will thank you to write to them and say that I dispense with your services . "
131216	131241	131204	131204	she	13990	" Pincott , you may kiss me . Good night . I should like you to have the pink dress ready for the morning . "
132087	132092	132093	132093	some	14275	" Frenchy ! Frenchy ! "

132542	132581	132539	132539	Alcide	1246	" had made a green place in the desert of his existence , - her suavity would ever contrast in memory with the grossierete of the rustic population , who were not worthy to possess such a jewel . "
132635	132640	132630	132630	he	1280	" La respectable Fribsbi , "
132641	132646	132630	132630	he	1280	" La vertueuse Fribsbi , "
132864	132871	132873	132873	Alcide	1246	" I declared myself to her , "
132882	133469	132876	132876	his	1246	" in a manner which was as novel as I am charmed to think it was agreeable . Where can not Love penetrate , respectable Madame Fribsbi ? Cupid is the father of invention ! - I inquired of the domestics what were the plats of which Mademoiselle partook with most pleasure ; and built up my little battery accordingly . On a day when her parents had gone to dine in the world and I am grieved to say that a grossier dinner at a restaurateur , in the Boulevard , or in the Palais Royal seemed to form the delights of these unrefined persons , the charming Miss entertained some comrades of the pension ; and I advised myself to send up a little repast suitable to so delicate young palates . Her lovely name is Blanche . The name of the maiden is white ; the wreath of roses which she wears is white . I determined that my dinner should be as spotless as the snow . At her accustomed hour , and instead of the rude gigot a l'eau , which was ordinarily served at her too simple table , I sent her up a little potage a la Reine - a la Reine Blanche I called it , - as white as her own tint - and confectioned with the most fragrant cream and almonds . I then offered up at her shrine a filet de merlan a l'gnes , and a delicate plat which I designated as Eperlan a la Sainte - Therese , and of which my charming Miss partook with pleasure . I followed this by two little entrees of sweetbread and chicken ; and the only brown thing which I permitted myself in the entertainment was a little roast of lamb , which I lay in a meadow of spinaches , surrounded with croustillons , representing sheep , and ornamented with daisies and other savage flowers . After this came my second service : a pudding a la Reine Elizabeth who , Madame Fribsbi knows , was a maiden princess ; a dish of opal - coloured plover 's eggs which I called Nid de tourtereaux a la Roucoule ; placing in the midst of them two of those tender volatiles , billing each other , and confectioned with butter ; a basket containing little gateaux of apricots , which , I know , all young ladies adore ; and a jelly of marasquin , bland insinuating , intoxicating as the glance of beauty . This I designated Ambroisie de Calypso a la Souveraine de mon Coeur . And when the ice was brought in - an ice of plombiere and cherries - how do you think I had shaped them , Madame Fribsbi ? In the form of two hearts united with an arrow , on which I had laid , before it entered , a bridal veil in cut - paper , surmounted by a wreath of virginal orange - flowers . I stood at the door to watch the effect of this entry . It was but one cry of admiration . The three young ladies filled their glasses with the sparkling Ay , and carried me in a toast . I heard it - I heard Miss speak of me - I heard her say , ' Tell Monsieur Mirobolant that we thank him - we admire him - we love him ! ' My feet almost failed me as she spoke . "

133527	133532	133524	133525	Dangerous man	5587	" cried the milliner . "

133763	133788	133757	133757	you	0	" asked Fribsby , in amazement , and not knowing whether the young lady or the lover might be labouring under a romantic delusion . "

133845	133879	133880	133880	Madame	16161	" said Madame Fribsby , who , by aptitude or education , seemed to have some knowledge of affairs of the heart , but the great artist 's brow darkened at this suggestion . "
133882	133886	133880	133880	Madame	16161	" he said , "

133957	133962	133934	133935	Miss Pincott	1276	" said the confidante . "
133967	133993	133934	133935	Miss Pincott	1276	" said the artist , with a deep bass voice , and a tragic accent worthy of the Port St Martin and his favourite melodrames , "
134199	136272	134196	134197	Gretna Grin	941	" Whether Alcides was as irresistible a conqueror as his namesake , or whether he was simply crazy , is a point which must be left to the reader 's judgment . But the latter if he had had the benefit of much French acquaintance , has perhaps met with men amongst them who fancied themselves almost as invincible ; and who , if you credit them , have made equal havoc in the hearts of les Anglaises . CHAPTER XXV Contains both Love and Jealousy Our readers have already heard Sir Francis Clavering 's candid opinion of the lady who had given him her fortune and restored him to his native country and home , and it must be owned that the Baronet was not far wrong in his estimate of his wife , and that Lady Clavering was not the wisest or the best educated of women . She had had a couple of years ' education in Europe , in a suburb of London , which she persisted in calling Ackney to her dying day , whence she had been summoned to join her father at Calcutta at the age of fifteen . And it was on her voyage thither , on board the Ramchunder East Indiaman , Captain Bragg , in which ship she had two years previously made her journey to Europe , that she formed the acquaintance of her first husband , Mr. Amory , who was third mate of the vessel in question . We are not going to enter into the early part of Lady Clavering 's history , but Captain Bragg , under whose charge Miss Snell went out to her father , who was one of the Captain 's consignees , and part owner of the Ramchunder and many other vessels , found reason to put the rebellious rascal of a mate in irons , until they reached the Cape , where the Captain left his officer behind ; and finally delivered his ward to her father at Calcutta , after a stormy and perilous voyage in which the Ramchunder and the cargo and passengers incurred no small danger and damage . Some months afterwards Amory made his appearance at Calcutta , having worked his way out before the mast from the Cape - married the rich Attorney 's daughter in spite of that old speculator - set up as indigo - planter and failed - set up as agent and failed again - set up as editor of the Sunderbund Pilot and failed again - quarrelling ceaselessly with his father - in - law and his wife during the progress of all these mercantile transactions and disasters , and ending his career finally with a crash which compelled him to leave Calcutta and go to New South Wales . It was in the course of these luckless proceedings , that Mr. Amory probably made the acquaintance of Sir Jasper Rogers , the respected Judge of the Supreme Court of Calcutta , who has been mentioned before : and , as the truth must out , it was by making an improper use of his father - in - law 's name , who could write perfectly well , and had no need of an amanuensis , that fortune finally forsook Mr. Amory and caused him to abandon all further struggles with her . Not being in the habit of reading the Calcutta law - reports very assiduously , the European public did not know of these facts as well as people did in Bengal , and Mrs. Amory and her father finding her residence in India not a comfortable one , it was agreed that the lady should return to Europe , whither she came with her little daughter Betsy or Blanche , then four years old . They were accompanied by Betsy 's nurse , who has been presented to the reader in the last chapter as the confidential maid of Lady Clavering , Mrs. Bonner : and Captain Bragg took a house for them in the near neighbourhood of his residence in Pocklington Street . It was a very hard bitter summer , and the rain it rained every day for some time after Mrs. Amory 's arrival . Bragg was very pompous and disagreeable , perhaps ashamed , perhaps anxious , to get rid of the Indian lady . She believed that all the world in London was talking about her husband 's disaster , and that the King and Queen and the Court of Directors were aware of her unlucky history . She had a good allowance from her father ; she had no call to live in England ; and she determined to go abroad . Away she went , then , glad to escape the gloomy surveillance of the odious bully , Captain Bragg . People had no objection to receive her at the continental towns where she stopped , and at the various boarding - houses , where she royally paid her way . She called Hackney Ackney , to be sure though otherwise she spoke English with a little foreign twang , very curious and not unpleasant ; she dressed amazingly ; she was conspicuous for her love of eating and drinking , and prepared curries and pillaws at every boarding - house which she frequented ; but her singularities of language and behaviour only gave a zest to her society , and Mrs. Amory was deservedly popular . She was the most good - natured , jovial , and generous of women . She was up to any party of pleasure by whomsoever proposed . She brought three times more champagne and fowl and ham to the picnics than anyone else . She took endless boxes for the play , and tickets for the masked balls , and gave them away to everybody . She paid the boarding - house people months beforehand ; she helped poor shabby mustachiod bucks and dowagers whose remittances had not arrived , with constant supplies from her purse ; and in this way she tramped through Europe , and appeared at Brussels , at Paris , at Milan , at Naples , at Rome , as her fancy led her . News of Amory 's death reached her at the latter place , where Captain Clavering was then staying , unable to pay his hotel bill , as , indeed , was his friend , the Chevalier Strong ; and the good - natured widow married the descendant of the ancient house of Clavering - professing , indeed , no particular grief for the scapegrace of a husband whom she had lost . We have brought her thus up to the present time when she was mistress of Clavering Park , in the midst of which Mr. Pinckney , the celebrated painter , pourtrayed her with her little boy by her side . Missy followed her mamma in most of her peregrinations , and so learned a deal of life . She had a governess for some time ; and after her mother 's second marriage , the benefit of Madame de Caramel 's select pension in the Champs Elysees . When the Claverings came to England , she of course came with them . It was only within a few years , after the death of her grandfather , and the birth of her little brother , that she began to understand that her position in life was altered , and that Miss Amory , nobody 's daughter , was a very small personage in a house compared with Master Francis Clavering , heir to an ancient baronetcy and a noble estate . But for little Frank , she would have been an heiress , in spite of her father : and though she knew , and cared not much about money , of which she never had any stint , and though she was a romantic little Muse , as we have seen , yet she could not reasonably be grateful to the persons who had so contributed to change her condition : nor , indeed , did she understand what the latter really was , until she had made some further progress , and acquired more accurate knowledge in the world . But this was clear , that her stepfather was dull and weak : that mamma dropped her H 's , and was not refined in manners or appearance ; and that little Frank was a spoiled quarrelsome urchin , always having his way , always treading upon her feet , always upsetting his dinner on her dresses , and keeping her out of her inheritance . None of these , as she felt , could comprehend her : and her solitary heart naturally pined for other attachments , and she sought around her where to bestow the precious boon of her unoccupied affection . This dear girl , then , from want of sympathy , or other cause , made herself so disagreeable at home , and frightened her mother and bored her stepfather so much , that they were quite as anxious as she could be that she should settle for herself in life ; and hence Sir Francis Clavering 's desire expressed to his friend , in the last chapter , that Mrs. Strong should die , and that he would take Blanche to himself as a second Mrs. Strong . But as this could not be , any other person was welcome to win her : and a smart young fellow , well - looking and well educated like our friend Arthur Pendennis , was quite free to propose for her if he had a mind , and would have been received with open arms by Lady Clavering as a son - in - law , had he had the courage to come forward as a competitor for Miss Amory 's hand . Mr. Pen , however , besides other drawbacks , chose to entertain an extreme diffidence about himself . He was ashamed of his late failures , of his idle and nameless condition , of the poverty which he had brought on his mother by his folly , and there was as much of vanity as remorse in his present state of doubt and distrust . How could he ever hope for such a prize as this brilliant Blanche Amory , who lived in a fine park and mansion , and was waited on by a score of grand domestics , whilst a maid - servant brought in their meagre meal at Fairoaks , and his mother was obliged to pinch and manage to make both ends meet ? Obstacles seemed for him insurmountable , which would have vanished had he marched manfully upon them : and he preferred despairing , or dallying with his wishes , - or perhaps he had not positively shaped them as yet , - to attempting to win gallantly the object of his desire . Many a young man fails by that species of vanity called shyness , who might , for the asking have his will . But we do not pretend to say that Pen had , as yet , ascertained his : or that he was doing much more than thinking about falling in love . Miss Amory was charming and lively . She fascinated and cajoled him by a thousand arts or natural graces or flatteries . But there were lurking reasons and doubts , besides shyness and vanity , withholding him . In spite of her cleverness , and her protestations , and her fascinations , Pen 's mother had divined the girl , and did not trust her . Mrs. Pendennis saw Blanche light - minded and frivolous , detected many wants in her which offended the pure and pious - minded lady ; a want of reverence for her parents , and for things more sacred , Helen thought : worldliness and selfishness couched under pretty words and tender expressions . Laura and Pen battled these points strongly at first with the widow - Laura being as yet enthusiastic about her new friend , and Pen not far - gone enough in love to attempt any concealment of his feelings . He would laugh at these objections of Helen 's , and say , "
136288	136579	136589	136589	his	5628	" But when , in the course of a month or two , and by watching the pair with that anxiety with which brooding women watch over their sons ' affections - and in acknowledging which , I have no doubt there is a sexual jealousy on the mother 's part , and a secret pang - when Helen saw that the intimacy appeared to make progress , that the two young people were perpetually finding pretexts to meet , and that Miss Blanche was at Fairoaks or Mr. Pen at the Park every day , the poor widow 's heart began to fail her - her darling project seemed to vanish before her ; and , giving way to her weakness , she fairly told Pen one day what her views and longings were ; that she felt herself breaking , and not long for this world , and that she hoped and prayed before she went , that she might see her two children one . The late events , Pen 's life and career and former passion for the actress , had broken the spirit of this tender lady . She felt that he had escaped her , and was in the maternal nest no more ; and she clung with a sickening fondness to Laura , Laura who had been left to her by Francis in Heaven . Pen kissed and soothed her in his grand patronising way . He had seen something of this , he had long thought his mother wanted to make this marriage - did Laura know anything of it ? Not she , - Mrs. Pendennis said - not for worlds would she have breathed a word of it to Laura - "
136595	136601	136589	136590	his mother	13927	" Pen said , laughingly : "
136662	136663	136660	136660	her	1261	" "
136672	136815	136666	136666	Pen	799	" was the widow 's reply ; not that Mr. Pen ever doubted that he was ; and a feeling of indefinable pleasure and self - complacency came over him as he thought over this proposal , and imaged Laura to himself , as his memory remembered her for years past , always fair and open , kindly and pious , cheerful , tender and true . He looked at her with brightening eyes as she came in from the garden at the end of this talk , her cheeks rather flushed , her looks frank and smiling - a basket of roses in her hand . She took the finest of them and brought it to Mrs. Pendennis , who was refreshed by the odour and colour of these flowers ; and hung over her fondly and gave it to her . "
136826	136843	136846	136846	she	5632	" Pen thought with a thrill of triumph , as he looked at the kindly girl . "
136857	137423	136846	136846	she	5632	" The image of the two women remained for ever after in his mind , and he never recalled it but the tears came into his eyes . Before very many weeks ' intimacy with her new acquaintance , however , Miss Laura was obliged to give in to Helen 's opinion , and own that the Muse was selfish , unkind , and inconstant . Of course Blanche confided to her bosom friend all the little griefs and domestic annoyances ; how the family could not comprehend her and she moved among them an isolated being ; how her poor mamma 's education had been neglected , and she was forced to blush for her blunders ; how Sir Francis was a weak person deplorably unintellectual , and only happy when smoking his odious cigars ; how , since the birth of her little brother , she had seen her mother 's precious affection , which she valued more than anything in life , estranged from her once darling daughter ; how she was alone , alone , alone in the world . But these griefs , real and heart - rending though they might be to a young lady of exquisite sensibility , did not convince Laura of the propriety of Blanche 's conduct in many small incidents of Little Frank , for instance , life might be very provoking , and might have deprived Blanche of her mamma 's affection , but this was no reason why Blanche should box the child 's ears because he upset a glass of water over her drawing , and why she should call him many opprobrious names in the English and French language ; and the preference accorded to little Frank was certainly no reason why Blanche should give herself imperial airs of command towards the boy 's governess , and send that young lady upon messages through the house to bring her book or to fetch her pocket - handkerchief . When a domestic performed an errand for honest Laura , she was always thankful and pleased ; whereas she could not but perceive that the little Muse had not the slightest scruple in giving her commands to all the world round about her , and in disturbing anybody 's ease or comfort , in order to administer to her own . It was Laura 's first experience in friendship ; and it pained the kind creature 's heart to be obliged to give up as delusions , one by one , those charms and brilliant qualities in which her fancy had dressed her new friend , and to find that the fascinating little fairy was but a mortal , and not a very amiable mortal after all . What generous person is there that has not been so deceived in his time ? - what person , perhaps , that has not so disappointed others in his turn ? After the scene with little Frank , in which that refractory son and heir of the house of Clavering had received the compliments in French and English , and the accompanying box on the ear from his sister , Miss Laura who had plenty of humour , could not help calling to mind some very touching and tender verses which the Muse had read to her out of Mes Larmes , and which began , "
137435	137500	136846	136846	she	5632	" in which the Muse , after complimenting the baby upon the station in life which it was about to occupy , and contrasting it with her own lonely condition , vowed nevertheless that the angel boy would never enjoy such affection as hers was , or find in the false world before him anything so constant and tender as a sister 's heart . "
137505	137511	136846	136846	she	5632	" the forlorn one said , "
137571	138204	138206	138206	Mamma	1205	" And behold the Muse was boxing the darling brother 's ears instead of kneeling at his feet , and giving Miss Laura her first lesson in the Cynical philosophy - not quite her first , however , - something like this selfishness and waywardness , something like this contrast between practice and poetry , between grand versified aspirations and everyday life , she had witnessed at home in the person of our young friend Mr. Pen . But then Pen was different . Pen was a man . It seemed natural somehow that he should be self - willed and should have his own way . And under his waywardness and selfishness , indeed there was a kind and generous heart . O it was hard that such a diamond should be changed away against such a false stone as this . In a word , Laura began to be tired of her admired Blanche . She had assayed her and found her not true ; and her former admiration and delight , which she had expressed with her accustomed generous artlessness , gave way to a feeling , which we shall not call contempt , but which was very near it ; and which caused Laura to adopt towards Miss Amory a grave and tranquil tone of superiority , which was at first by no means to the Muse 's liking . Nobody likes to be found out , or , having held a high place , to submit to step down . The consciousness that this event was impending did not serve to increase Miss Blanche 's good - humour , and as it made her peevish and dissatisfied with herself , it probably rendered her even less agreeable to the persons round about her . So there arose , one fatal day , a battle - royal between dearest Blanche and dearest Laura , in which the friendship between them was all but slain outright . Dearest Blanche had been unusually capricious and wicked on this day . She had been insolent to her mother ; savage with little Frank ; odiously impertinent in her behaviour to the boy 's governess ; and intolerably cruel to Pincott , her attendant . Not venturing to attack her friend for the little tyrant was of a timid feline nature , and only used her claws upon those who were weaker than herself , she maltreated all these , and especially poor Pincott , who was menial , confidante , companion slave always , according to the caprice of her young mistress . This girl , who had been sitting in the room with the young ladies , being driven thence in tears , occasioned by the cruelty of her mistress , and raked with a parting sarcasm as she went sobbing from the door , Laura fairly broke out into a loud and indignant invective - wondered how one so young could forget the deference owing to her elders as well as to her inferiors in station ; and professing so much sensibility of her own , could torture the feelings of others so wantonly . Laura told her friend that her conduct was absolutely wicked , and that she ought to ask pardon of Heaven on her knees for it . And having delivered herself of a hot and voluble speech whereof the delivery astonished the speaker as much almost as her auditor , she ran to her bonnet and shawl , and went home across the park in a great flurry and perturbation , and to the surprise of Mrs. Pendennis , who had not expected her until night . Alone with Helen , Laura gave an account of the scene , and gave up her friend henceforth . "
138208	138212	138213	138213	you	1205	" she said , "
138287	138328	138329	138330	That girl	2650	" On this the two ladies went through the osculatory ceremony which they were in the habit of performing , and Mrs. Pendennis got a great secret comfort from the little quarrel - for Laura 's confession seemed to say , "
138388	138480	138484	138484	he	799	" But Miss Laura did not tell Mrs. Pendennis , perhaps did not acknowledge to herself , what had been the real cause of the day 's quarrel . Being in a very wicked mood , and bent upon mischief everywhere , the little wicked Muse of a Blanche had very soon begun her tricks . Her darling Laura had come to pass a long day ; and as they were sitting in her own room together , had chosen to bring the conversation round to the subject of Mr. Pen . "
138489	138494	138484	138484	he	799	" Miss Blanche observed ; "
138512	138513	138495	138496	Mrs. Pybus	715	" "
138532	138540	138524	138524	I	0	" Laura answered , blushing very much . "
138547	138556	138557	138557	He	799	" Blanche said , wagging her little head . "
138563	138564	138568	138568	he	799	" "
138572	138577	138568	138568	he	799	" Laura cried out ; "
138615	138616	138612	138612	he	799	" "
138630	138635	138619	138619	you	0	" interposed Miss Blanche . "
138641	138645	138636	138636	Mamma	1205	" said Laura . "
138653	138660	138648	138648	he	799	" continued the other little dear , "
138675	138676	138669	138669	you	0	" "
138716	138722	138708	138708	I	0	" Laura said , laughing . "
138735	138740	138724	138724	he	799	" asked Miss Amory . "
138746	138786	138724	138724	he	799	" said Miss Bell . Blanche ran up to her friend , kissed her fondly , called her my dearest Laura at least three times , looked her archly in the face , nodded her head , and said , "
138803	138899	138797	138797	I	0	" And tripping across the room daintily to a little mother - of - pearl inlaid desk , she opened it with a silver key , and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green , which she submitted to her friend . Laura took them and read them . They were love - verses sure enough - something about Undine - about a Naiad - about a river . She looked at them for a long time ; but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes . "
138908	138916	138901	138901	you	0	" she asked , putting them back . "
138926	140191	138924	138924	dearest	5651	" the other said : and when her dearest Laura had quite done with the verses , she tripped back and popped them again into the pretty desk . Then she went to her piano , and sang two or three songs of Rossini , whose flourishes of music her flexible little voice could execute to perfection , and Laura sate by , vaguely listening as she performed these pieces . What was Miss Bell thinking about the while ? She hardly knew ; but sate there silent as the songs rolled by . After this concert the young ladies were summoned to the room where luncheon was served ; and whither they of course went with their arms round each other 's waists . And it could not have been jealousy or anger on Laura 's part which had made her silent ; for , after they had tripped along the corridor and descended the steps , and were about to open the door which leads into the hall , Laura paused , and looking her friend kindly and frankly in the face , kissed her with a sisterly warmth . Something occurred after this - Master Frank 's manner of eating , probably , or mamma 's blunders , or Sir Francis smelling of cigars - which vexed Miss Blanche , and she gave way to that series of naughtinesses whereof we have spoken , and which ended in the above little quarrel . CHAPTER XXVI A House full of Visitors The difference between the girls did not last long . Laura was always too eager to forgive and be forgiven , and as for Miss Blanche , her hostilities , never very long or durable , had not been provoked by the above scene . Nobody cares about being accused of wickedness . No vanity is hurt by that sort of charge : Blanche was rather pleased than provoked by her friend 's indignation , which never would have been raised but for a cause which both knew , though neither spoke of . And so Laura , with a sigh , was obliged to confess that the romantic part of her first friendship was at an end , and that the object of it was only worthy of a very ordinary sort of regard . As for Blanche , she instantly composed a copy of touching verses , setting forth her desertion and disenchantment . It was only the old story , she wrote , of love meeting with coldness , and fidelity returned by neglect ; and some new neighbours arriving from London about this time , in whose family there were daughters , Miss Amory had the advantage of selecting an eternal friend from one of these young ladies , and imparting her sorrows and disappointments to this new sister . The tall footmen came but seldom now with notes to the sweet Laura ; the pony - carriage was but rarely despatched to Fairoaks to be at the orders of the ladies there . Blanche adopted a sweet look of suffering martyrdom when Laura came to see her . The other laughed at her friend 's sentimental mood , and treated it with a good - humour that was by no means respectful . But if Miss Blanche found new female friends to console her , the faithful historian is also bound to say , that she discovered some acquaintances of the other sex who seemed to give her consolation too . If ever this artless young creature met a young man , and had ten minutes ' conversation with him in a garden walk , in a drawing - room window , or in the intervals of a waltz , she confided in him , so to speak - made play with her beautiful eyes - spoke in a tone of tender interest , and simple and touching appeal , and left him , to perform the same pretty little drama in behalf of his successor . When the Claverings first came down to the Park , there were very few audiences before whom Miss Blanche could perform : hence Pen had all the benefits of her glances and confidences , and the drawing - room window or the garden walk all to himself . In the town of Clavering , it has been said , there were actually young men : in the near surrounding country , only a curate or two or a rustic young squire , with large feet and ill - made clothes . To the dragoons quartered at Chatteris the Baronet made no overtures : it was unluckily his own regiment : he had left it on bad terms with some officers of the corps - an ugly business about a horse bargain - a disputed play account - blind - Hookey - a white feather - who need ask ? - it is not our business to inquire too closely into the bygones of our characters , except in so far as their previous history appertains to the development of this present story . But the autumn , and the end of the Parliamentary Session and the London season , brought one or two county families down to their houses , and filled tolerably the neighbouring little watering - place of Baymouth , and opened our friend Mr. Bingley 's Theatre Royal at Chatteris , and collected the usual company at the Assizes and Race - balls there . Up to this time , the old county families had been rather shy of our friends of Clavering Park . The Fogeys of Drummington ; the Squares of Tozely Park ; the Welbores of The Barrow , etc . : all sorts of stories were current among these folks regarding the family at Clavering ; - indeed , nobody ought to say that people in the country have no imagination who heard them talk about new neighbours . About Sir Francis and his Lady , and her birth and parentage , about Miss Amory , about Captain Strong , there had been endless histories which need not be recapitulated ; and the family of the Park had been three months in the county before the great people around began to call . But at the end of the season , the Earl of Trehawk , Lord Lieutenant of the County , coming to Eyrie Castle , and the Countess Dowager of Rockminster , whose son was also a magnate of the land , to occupy a mansion on the Marine Parade at Baymouth - these great folks came publicly , immediately , and in state , to call upon the family of Clavering Park ; and the carriages of the county families speedily followed in the track which had been left in the avenue by their lordly wheels . It was then that Mirobolant began to have an opportunity of exercising that skill which he possessed , and of forgetting , in the occupations of his art , the pangs of love . It was then that the large footmen were too much employed at Clavering Park to be able to bring messages , or dally over the cup of small beer with the poor little maids at Fairoaks . It was then that Blanche found other dear friends than Laura , and other places to walk in besides the river - side , where Pen was fishing . He came day after day , and whipped the stream , but the "
140196	140833	140834	140835	The Bishop	2190	" would n't do their duty , nor the Peri appear . And here , though in strict confidence , and with a request that the matter go no further , we may as well allude to a delicate business , of which previous hint has been given . Mention has been made , in a former page , of a certain hollow tree , at which Pen used to take his station when engaged in his passion for Miss Fotheringay , and the cavity of which he afterwards used for other purposes than to insert his baits and fishing - cans in . The truth is , be converted this tree into a post - office . Under a piece of moss and a stone , he used to put little poems , or letters equally poetical , which were addressed to a certain Undine , or Naiad who frequented the stream , and which , once or twice , were replaced by a receipt in the shape of a flower , or by a modest little word or two of acknowledgment , written in a delicate hand , in French or English , and on pink scented paper . Certainly , Miss Amory used to walk by this stream , as we have seen ; and it is a fact that she used pink scented paper for her correspondence . But after the great folks had invaded Clavering Park , and the family coach passed out of the lodge - gates , evening after evening , on their way to the other great country houses , nobody came to fetch Pen 's letters at the post - office ; the white paper was not exchanged for the pink , but lay undisturbed under its stone and its moss , whilst the tree was reflected into the stream , and the Brawl went rolling by . There was not much in the letters certainly ; in the pink notes scarcely anything - merely a little word or two , half jocular , half sympathetic , such as might be written by any young lady . But oh , you silly Pendennis , if you wanted this one , why did you not speak ? Perhaps neither party was in earnest . You were only playing at being in love , and the sportive little Undine was humouring you at the same play . But if a man is baulked at this game , he not unfrequently loses his temper ; and when nobody came any more for Pen 's poems , he began to look upon those compositions in a very serious light . He felt almost tragical and romantic again , as in his first affair of the heart : - at any rate he was bent upon having an explanation . One day he went to the Hall and there was a roomful of visitors : on another , Miss Amory was not to be seen ; she was going to a ball that night , and was lying down to take a little sleep . Pen cursed balls , and the narrowness of his means , and the humility of his position in the country that caused him to be passed over by the givers of these entertainments . On a third occasion , Miss Amory was in the garden , and he ran thither ; she was walking there in state with no less personages than the Bishop and Bishopess of Chatteris and the episcopal family , who scowled at him , and drew up in great dignity when he was presented to them , and they heard his name . The Right Reverend Prelate had heard it before , and also of the little transaction in the Dean 's garden . "
140844	140854	140834	140835	The Bishop	2190	" good - natured Lady Clavering whispered to him . "
140936	140972	140973	140973	You	0	" Mrs. Pendennis was too unwell to come out but Laura and Pen came , and there was a great party , and Pen only got an opportunity of a hurried word with Miss Amory . "
140980	140984	140985	140985	I	0	" he said . "
140989	140993	140985	140985	I	0	" said Blanche , "
141001	141002	140999	140999	people	2241	" "
141009	141020	141003	141003	Undine	1297	" Mr. Pen went on , choosing to be poetical . "
141029	141034	141035	141035	She	1297	" Miss Amory answered . "
141063	141097	141056	141056	you	5669	" she added , looking him full in the face an instant , and dropping her eyes . If he wanted her , why did he not speak then ? She might have said "
141099	141145	141146	141146	Blanche	1236	" even then . But as she spoke of other consolations at home , he thought of Laura , so affectionate and so pure , and of his mother at home , who had bent her fond heart upon uniting him with her adopted daughter . "
141148	141158	141146	141146	Blanche	1236	" he began , in a vexed tone , - "
141162	141163	141164	141164	Laura	799	" "
141173	141179	141164	141164	Laura	799	" the young lady said . "
141188	141384	141180	141180	I	0	" and she ran off , leaving Mr. Pendennis to bite his nails in perplexity , and to look out into the moonlight in the garden . Laura indeed was looking at Pen . She was talking with , or appearing to listen to the talk of , Mr. Pynsent , Lord Rockminster 's son , and grandson of the Dowager Lady , who was seated in state in the place of honour , gravely receiving Lady Clavering 's bad grammar , and patronising the vacuous Sir Francis , whose interest in the county she was desirous to secure . Pynsent and Pen had been at Oxbridge together , where the latter , during his heyday of good fortune and fashion , had been the superior of the young patrician , and perhaps rather supercilious towards him . They had met for the first time , since they parted at the University , at the table to - day , and given each other that exceedingly impertinent and amusing demi - nod of recognition which is practised in England only , and only to perfection by University men , - and which seems to say , "
141394	141395	141390	141390	you	5672	" "
141403	141411	141412	141414	a Mr. Pendennis	739	" Mr. Pynsent said to Miss Bell - "
141419	141420	141412	141414	a Mr. Pendennis	739	" "
141423	141428	141412	141414	a Mr. Pendennis	739	" said Miss Bell . "
141437	141458	141434	141435	Miss Amory	1236	" the gentleman went on . Laura looked at them , and perhaps thought so too , but said nothing . "
141494	141498	141499	141499	His	5673	" Laura smiled . "
141526	141527	141516	141516	He	5673	" "
141530	141539	141516	141516	He	5673	" asked Mr. Pynsent , with a laugh . "
141553	141558	141516	141516	He	5673	" answered Miss Bell . "
141568	141578	141579	141579	We	5685	" said the simple gentleman . Laura smiled again . "
141595	141596	141597	141597	Pendennis	739	" "
141604	141609	141597	141597	Pendennis	739	" continued Mr. Pynsent . "
141617	141649	141610	141610	You	5686	" the girl said , laughing , and greatly amused at the notion that her Pen was a great county gentleman , and perhaps had given himself out to be such . "
141660	141675	141678	141678	you	5686	" Mr. Pynsent said , gallantly , and with a look which fairly said , "
141687	141774	141678	141678	you	5686	" - to which look and speech Miss Laura vouchsafed a smile , and made a little bow . Here Blanche came stepping up with her most fascinating smile and ogle , and begged dear Laura to come and take the second in a song . Laura was ready to do anything good - natured , and went to the piano ; by which Mr. Pynsent listened as long as the duet lasted , and until Miss Amory began for herself , when he strode away . "
141792	141808	141809	141811	the tall one	5688	" said Mr. Pynsent to a gentleman who had come over with him from Baymouth - "
141830	141831	141828	141828	they	5689	" "
141843	141847	141834	141834	you	1033	" asked Wagg . "
141858	141867	141868	141868	She	5690	" said Mr. Pynsent , with great candour . "
141898	141904	141906	141907	the other	14365	" Pynsent , be civil , "
141914	141915	141906	141907	the other	14365	" "
141924	141929	141920	141922	Pendennis of Boniface	1151	" Mr. Pynsent said . "
141945	141946	141941	141943	your charming cousin	5697	" "
141957	141962	141963	141964	His nephew	14513	" asked Mr. Wagg . "
141976	142193	142194	142195	Old gardener	5700	" Mr. Pen said with his very best air - the acquaintance between the gentlemen was made in an instant . In the afternoon of the next day , the two gentlemen who were staying at Clavering Park were found by Mr. Pen on his return from a fishing excursion , in which he had no sport , seated in his mother 's drawing - room in comfortable conversation with the widow and her ward . Mr. Pynsent , tall and gaunt , with large red whiskers and an imposing tuft to his chin , was striding over a chair in the intimate neighbourhood of Miss Laura . She was amused by his talk , which was simple , straightforward , rather humorous and keen , and interspersed with homely expressions of a style which is sometimes called slang . It was the first specimen of a young London dandy that Laura had seen or heard : for she had been but a chit at the time of Mr. Foker 's introduction at Fairoaks , nor indeed was that ingenuous gentleman much more than a boy , and his refinement was only that of a school and college . Mr. Wagg , as he entered the Fairoaks premises with his companion , eyed and noted everything . "
142197	142208	142194	142195	Old gardener	5700	" he said , seeing Mr. John at the lodge - "
142264	142265	142266	142268	Snug little crib	5706	" "
142270	142275	142266	142268	Snug little crib	5706	" said Mr. Pynsent , "
142281	142282	142283	142284	Mr. Pendennis	685	" "
142291	142303	142288	142289	old gentleman	5708	" Mr. Wagg said to the old domestic . John answered , "
142312	142313	142306	142307	Master Pendennis	685	" "
142320	142330	142333	142333	they	5701	" asked the younger visitor . Mr. John answered , "
142336	142429	142430	142431	Old fellow	2681	" and as the pair walked over the trim gravel , and by the neat shrubberies , up the steps to the hall - door , which old John opened , Mr. Wagg noted everything that he saw ; the barometer and the letter - bag , the umbrellas and the ladies ' clogs , Pen 's hats and tartan wrapper , and old John opening the drawing - room door , to introduce the new - comers . Such minutiae attracted Wagg instinctively ; he seized them in spite of himself . "
142437	142443	142444	142445	Caleb Balderstone	1306	" he whispered to Pynsent . "
142456	142624	142451	142451	he	1306	" The next minute the pair were in the presence of the Fairoaks ladies ; in whom Pynsent could not help recognising two perfectly well - bred ladies , and to whom Mr. Wagg made his obeisance , with florid bows , and extra courtesy , accompanied with an occasional knowing leer at his companion . Mr. Pynsent did not choose to acknowledge these signals , except by extreme haughtiness towards Mr. Wagg , and particular deference to the ladies . If there was one thing laughable in Mr. Wagg 's eyes , it was poverty . He had the soul of a butler who had been brought from his pantry to make fun in the drawing - room . His jokes were plenty , and his good - nature thoroughly genuine , but he did not seem to understand that a gentleman could wear an old coat , or that a lady could be respectable unless she had her carriage , or employed a French milliner . "
142630	142639	142628	142628	ma'am	2685	" said he , bowing to the widow ; "
142656	142680	142646	142646	Cocknies	1307	" The widow said simply , she had never been in London but once in her life - before her son was born . "
142689	142694	142646	142646	Cocknies	1307	" said Mr. Wagg , "
142737	142738	142739	142739	My	0	" "
142753	142758	142742	142743	Major Pendennis	693	" the widow said , "
142775	142798	142773	142773	sir	2261	" Helen continued , who never could be brought to like Mr. Wagg 's books , and detested their tone most thoroughly . "
142806	142816	142801	142804	my very good friend	5727	" Mr. Wagg said , with a low bow , "
142895	143370	143373	143373	they	5734	" and he poured out a flood of fashionable talk , introducing the names of a score of peers , and rattling on with breathless spirits , whilst the simple widow listened in silent wonder . What a man , she thought ; are all the men of fashion in London like this ? I am sure Pen will never like him . Mr. Pynsent was in the meanwhile engaged with Miss Laura . He named some of the houses in the neighbourhood whither he was going , and hoped very much that he should see Miss Bell at some of them . He hoped that her aunt would give her a season in London . He said , that in the next parliament it was probable that he should canvass the county , and he hoped to get Pendennis 's interest here . He spoke of Pen 's triumph as an orator at Oxbridge , and asked was he coming into parliament too ? He talked on very pleasantly , and greatly to Laura 's satisfaction , until Pen himself appeared , and , as has been said , found these gentlemen . Pen behaved very courteously to the pair , now that they have found their way into his quarters ; and though he recollected with some twinges a conversation at Oxbridge , when Pynsent was present , and in which after a great debate at the Union , and in the midst of considerable excitement produced by a supper and champagne - cup , - he had announced his intention of coming in for his native county , and had absolutely returned thanks in a fine speech as the future member ; yet Mr. Pynsent 's manner was so frank and cordial , that Pen hoped Pynsent might have forgotten his little fanfaronnade , and any other braggadocio speeches or actions which he might have made . He suited himself to the tone of the visitors , then , and talked about Plinlimmon and Magnus Charters , and the old set at Oxbridge , with careless familiarity and high - bred ease , as if he lived with marquises every day , and a duke was no more to him than a village curate . But at this juncture , and it being then six o'clock in the evening , Betsy , the maid , who did not know of the advent of strangers , walked into the room without any preliminary but that of flinging the door wide open before her , and bearing in her arms a tray , containing three tea - cups , a tea - pot , and a plate of thick bread - and - butter . All Pen 's splendour and magnificence vanished away at this - and he faltered and became quite abashed . "
143378	143461	143373	143373	they	5734	" he thought : and , indeed , Wagg thrust his tongue in his cheek , thought the tea infinitely contemptible , and leered and winked at Pynsent to that effect . But to Mr. Pynsent the transaction appeared perfectly simple - there was no reason present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded , as well as at any other hour ; and he asked of Mr. Wagg , when they went away , "
143477	143478	143475	143475	him	5736	" "
143527	143533	143511	143511	I	0	" Mr. Wagg chuckled out . "
143540	143545	143548	143548	you	5737	" said Mr. Pynsent . "
143551	143608	143548	143548	you	5737	" growled Wagg between his teeth ; they walked home rather sulkily . Wagg told the story at dinner very smartly , with wonderful accuracy of observation . He described old John , the clothes that were drying , the clogs in the hall , the drawing - room , and its furniture and pictures ; - "
143723	143779	143780	143780	I	0	" Blanche , near whom he sate as he told this story , and who adored les hommes desprit , burst out laughing , and called him such an odd , droll creature . But Pynsent , who began to be utterly disgusted with him , broke out in a loud voice , and said , "
143839	143871	143833	143833	you	2685	" he added , addressing Lady Rockminster , who was seated at Sir Francis Clavering 's right hand . Sir Francis turned to the guest on his left , and whispered . "
143882	143908	143875	143875	I	0	" And Lady Clavering , giving the young gentleman a delighted tap with her fan , winked her black eyes at him , and said , "
143918	144026	143912	143912	you	1304	" After the affair with Blanche , a difference ever so slight , a tone of melancholy , perhaps a little bitter , might be perceived in Laura 's converse with her cousin . She seemed to weigh him and find him wanting too ; the widow saw the girl 's clear and honest eyes watching the young man at times , and a look of almost scorn pass over her face , as he lounged in the room with the women , or lazily sauntered smoking upon the lawn , or lolled under a tree there over a book which he was too listless to read . "
144033	144043	144031	144031	you	1304	" eager - sighted Helen asked of the girl . "
144062	144063	144060	144060	Laura	799	" "
144070	144074	144060	144060	Laura	799	" Laura said . "
144084	144090	144078	144078	you	1304	" asked his mother quickly . "
144098	144103	144095	144096	dear mother	2764	" said the girl . "
144175	144183	144169	144169	Captain	3508	" she added with a bitter laugh ; "
144220	144221	144222	144222	We	5757	" "
144231	144243	144222	144222	We	5757	" said the widow , her heart beginning to beat violently . "
144270	144271	144262	144262	he	799	" "
144281	144286	144275	144275	yourself	5762	" the girl answered . "
144433	144434	144435	144435	I	0	" "
144444	144449	144435	144435	I	0	" interposed the widow . "
144536	144537	144533	144533	he	1033	" "
144541	144551	144533	144533	he	1033	" said Helen , taking the girl 's hand . "
144587	144588	144567	144567	I	0	" "
144593	144602	144591	144591	mother	2244	" Laura cried , embracing her friend hastily . "
144624	144659	144621	144621	you	2244	" Helen said there were more than two hundred pounds at the bank , and that she would be enabled to pay off all Laura 's money by the end of the next year . "
144698	144947	144695	144696	dearest mamma	5789	" said the good girl ; upon which , and with her usual tenderness and emotion , the fond widow declared that Laura was a blessing to her and the best of girls - and I hope no one in this instance will be disposed to contradict her . The widow and her daughter had more than one conversation on this subject ; and the elder gave way to the superior reason of the honest and stronger - minded girl ; and indeed , whenever there was a sacrifice to be made on her part , this kind lady was only too eager to make it . But she took her own way , and did not loose sight of the end she had in view , in imparting these new plans to Pen . One day she told him of these projects , and it who that had formed them ; how it was Laura who insisted upon his going to London and studying ; how it was Laura who would not hear of the - the money arrangements when he came back from Oxbridge - being settled just then : how it was Laura whom he had to thank , if indeed he thought that he had to go . At that news Pen 's countenance blazed up with pleasure , and he hugged his mother to his heart with an ardour that I fear disappointed the fond lady ; but she rallied when he said , "
145087	145342	145076	145076	she	2953	" Pen went on with more incoherent phrases ; paced up and down the room , drank glasses of water , jumped about his mother with a thousand embraces - began to laugh - began to sing - was happier than she had seen him since he was a boy - since he had tasted of the fruit of that awful Tree of Life , which , from the beginning , has tempted all mankind . Laura was not at home . Laura was on a visit to the stately Lady Rockminster , daughter to my Lord Bareacres , sister to the late Lady Pontypool , and by consequence a distant kinswoman of Helen 's , as her ladyship , who was deeply versed in genealogy , was graciously to point out to the modest country lady . Mr. Pen was greatly delighted at the relationship being acknowledged ; though perhaps not over well pleased that Lady Rockminster took Miss Bell home with her for a couple of days to Baymouth , and did not make the slightest invitation to Mr. Arthur Pendennis . There was to be a ball at Baymouth , and it was to be Miss Laura 's first appearance . The dowager came to fetch her in her carriage , and she went off with a white dress in her box , happy and blushing , like the rose to which Pen compared her . This was the night of the ball - a public entertainment at the Baymouth Hotel . "
145346	145350	145076	145076	she	2953	" said Pen , "
145369	145478	145479	145479	I	0	" His mother was charmed that he should do so ; and , as he was debating about the conveyance in which he should start for Baymouth , Captain Strong called opportunely , said he was going himself , and that he would put his horse , The Butcher Boy , into the gig , and drive Pen over . When the grand company began to fill the house at Clavering Park , the Chevalier Strong , who , as his patron said , was never in the way or out of it , seldom intruded himself upon its society , but went elsewhere to seek his relaxation . "
145490	145494	145499	145499	Jove	1002	" he said , "
145604	145663	145574	145574	I	0	" So on a gala - day at Clavering Park , the Chevalier would content himself with superintending the arrangements of the table , and drilling the major - domo and servants ; and having looked over the bill - of - fare with Monsieur Mirobolant , would not care to take the least part in the banquet . "
145678	146136	145574	145574	I	0	" this philosopher would say , and from the windows of that apartment , which commanded the terrace and avenue , he would survey the company as they arrived in their carriages , or take a peep at the ladies in the hall through an oeil - de - boeuf which commanded it from his corridor . And the guests being seated , Strong would cross the park to Captain Glanders 's cottage at Clavering , or to pay the landlady a visit at the Clavering Arms , or to drop in upon Madame Fribsby over her novel and tea . Wherever the Chevalier went he was welcome , and whenever he came away a smell of hot brandy - and - water lingered behind him . The Butcher Boy - not the worst horse in Sir Francis 's stable - was appropriated to Captain Strong 's express use ; and the old Campaigner saddled him or brought him home at all hours of the day or night , and drove or rode him up and down the country . Where there was a public - house with a good tap of beer - where there was a tenant with a pretty daughter who played on the piano - to Chatteris , to the play , or the barracks - to Baymouth , if any fun was on foot there ; to the rural fairs or races , the Chevalier and his brown horse made their way continually ; and this worthy gentleman lived at free quarters in a friendly country . The Butcher Boy soon took Pen and the Chevalier to Baymouth . The latter was as familiar with the hotel and landlord there as with every other inn round about ; and having been accommodated with a bedroom to dress , they entered the ballroom . The Chevalier was splendid . He wore three little gold crosses in a brochette on the portly breast of his blue coat , and looked like a foreign field - marshal . The ball was public and all sorts of persons were admitted and encouraged to come , young Pynsent having views upon the county and Lady Rockminster being patroness of the ball . There was a quadrille for the aristocracy at one end , and select benches for the people of fashion . Towards this end the Chevalier did not care to penetrate far as he said he did not care for the nobs ; but in the other part of the room he knew everybody - the wine - merchants ' , innkeepers ' , tradesmen 's , solicitors ' , squire - farmers ' daughters , their sires and brothers , and plunged about shaking hands . "
146152	146189	146191	146191	Jupiter	1313	" asked Pen . A gentleman in black with ringlets and a tuft stood gazing fiercely about him , with one hand in the arm - hole of his waistcoat and the other holding his claque . "
146197	146205	146191	146191	Jupiter	1313	" cried Strong , bursting out laughing . "
146217	146218	146215	146215	Chevalier	5804	" "
146227	146239	146225	146225	Chevalier	1225	" said the Chef , laying his hand on his decoration . "
146249	146358	146359	146360	My friend	14473	" said Pen , amused . A man with very black hair and whiskers , dyed evidently with the purple of Tyre , with twinkling eyes and white eyelashes , and a thousand wrinkles in his face , which was of a strange red colour , with two under - vests , and large gloves and hands , and a profusion of diamonds and jewels in his waistcoat and stock , with coarse feet crumpled into immense shiny boots , and a piece of parti - coloured ribbon in his button - hole , here came up and nodded familiarly to the Chevalier . The Chevalier shook hands . "
146364	146368	146361	146362	Mr. Pendennis	739	" Strong said . "
146383	146506	146378	146381	the Nawaub of Lucknow	5808	" That officer bowed to the salute of Pen ; who was now looking out eagerly to see if the person wanted had entered the room . Not yet . But the band began presently performing ' See the Conquering Hero comes , ' and a host of fashionables - Dowager Countess of Rockminster , Mr. Pynsent and Miss Bell , Sir Francis Clavering , Bart . , of Clavering Park , Lady Clavering and Miss Amory , Sir Horace Fogey , Bart . , Lady Fogey , Colonel and Mrs. Higgs Wagg , Esq . as the county paper afterwards described them , entered the room . Pen rushed by Blanche , ran up to Laura , and seized her hand . "
146511	146515	146509	146509	you	5809	" he said , "
146535	146536	146533	146533	you	5809	" "
146545	146607	146542	146543	dear Pen	799	" she said , smiling : and he fell back , biting his nails with vexation , and forgetting to salute Pynsent . After Lady Rockminster 's party , Lady Clavering 's followed in the procession . Colonel Altamont eyed it hard , holding a most musky pocket - handkerchief up to his face , and bursting with laughter behind it . "
146620	146626	146616	146616	'em	5810	" he asked of Strong . "
146637	146885	146629	146630	Miss Amory	1236	" replied the Chevalier . The Colonel could hardly contain himself for laughing . CHAPTER XXVII Contains some Ball - practising Under some calico draperies in the shady embrasure of a window , Arthur Pendennis chose to assume a very gloomy and frowning countenance , and to watch Miss Bell dance her first quadrille with Mr. Pynsent for a partner . That gentleman was as solemn and severe as Englishmen are upon such occasions , and walked through the dance as he would have walked up to his pew in church , without a smile upon his face , or allowing any outward circumstance to interfere with his attention to the grave duty in which he was engaged . But Miss Laura 's face was beaming with pleasure and good - nature . The lights and the crowd and music excited her . As she spread out her white robes , and performed her part of the dance , smiling and happy , her brown ringlets flowing back over her fair shoulders from her honest rosy face , more than one gentleman in the room admired and looked after her ; and Lady Fogey , who had a house in London and gave herself no small airs of fashion when in the country , asked of Lady Rockminster who the young person was , mentioned a reigning beauty in London whom , in her ladyship 's opinion , Laura was rather like , and pronounced that she would "
146888	146904	146629	146630	Miss Amory	1236	" Lady Rockminster would have been very much surprised if any protegee of hers would not "
146907	147092	146629	146630	Miss Amory	1236	" and wondered at Lady Fogey 's impudence in judging upon the point at all . She surveyed Laura with majestic glances through her eyeglass . She was pleased with the girl 's artless looks , and gay innocent manner . Her manner is very good , her ladyship thought . Her arms are rather red , but that is a defect of her youth . Her tone is far better than that of the little pert Miss Amory , who is dancing opposite to her . Miss Blanche was , indeed , the vis - a - vis of Miss Laura , and smiled most killingly upon her dearest friend , and nodded to her and talked to her , when they met during the quadrille evolutions , and patronised her a great deal . Her shoulders were the whitest in the whole room : and they were never easy in her frock for one single instant : nor were her eyes , which rolled about incessantly : nor was her little figure : - it seemed to say to all the people , "
147180	147372	147172	147172	you	739	" Laura went on dancing , and keeping an attentive eye upon Mr. Pen in the embrasure of the window . He did not quit that retirement during the first quadrille , nor until the second , when the good - natured Lady Clavering beckoned to him to come up to her to the dais or place of honour where the dowagers were , - and whither Pen went blushing and exceedingly awkward , as most conceited young fellows are . He performed a haughty salutation to Lady Rockminster , who hardly acknowledged his bow , and then went and paid his respects to the widow of the late Amory , who was splendid in diamonds , velvet , lace , feathers , and all sorts of millinery and goldsmith 's ware . Young Mr. Fogey , then in the fifth form at Eton , and ardently expecting his beard and his commission in a dragoon regiment , was the second partner who was honoured with Miss Bell 's hand . He was rapt in admiration of that young lady . He thought he had never seen so charming a creature . "
147382	147783	147784	147784	I	0	" for this young gentleman had been dancing with Miss Amory before , he candidly said to her . Laura laughed , and looked more good - humoured than ever ; and in the midst of her laughter caught a sight of Pen , and continued to laugh as he , on his side , continued to look absurdly pompous and sulky . The next dance was a waltz , and young Fogey thought , with a sigh , that he did not know how to waltz , and vowed he would have a master the next holidays . Mr. Pynsent again claimed Miss Bell 's hand for this dance ; and Pen beheld her , in a fury , twirling round the room , her waist encircled by the arm of that gentleman . He never used to be angry before when , on summer evenings , the chairs and tables being removed , and the governess called downstairs to play the piano , he and the Chevalier Strong who was a splendid performer , and could dance a British hornpipe , a German waltz , or a Spanish fandango , if need were , and the two young ladies , Blanche and Laura , improvised little balls at Clavering Park . Laura enjoyed this dancing so much , and was so animated , that she even animated Mr. Pynsent . Blanche , who could dance beautifully , had an unlucky partner , Captain Broadfoot , of the Dragoons , then stationed at Chatteris . For Captain Broadfoot , though devoting himself with great energy to the object in view , could not get round in time : and , not having the least ear for music , was unaware that his movements were too slow . So , in the waltz as in the quadrille , Miss Blanche saw that her dear friend Laura had the honours of the dance , and was by no means pleased with the latter 's success . After a couple of turns with the heavy dragoon , she pleaded fatigue , and requested to be led back to her place , near her mamma , to whom Pen was talking ; and she asked him why he had not asked her to waltz , and had left her for the mercies of that great odious man in spurs and a red coat ? "
147801	147805	147784	147784	I	0	" Pen answered . "
147824	147825	147826	147826	You	0	" "
147837	147849	147850	147850	You	0	" said Miss Amory , with another shrug of the shoulders . "
147868	147869	147856	147857	Your cousin	5297	" "
147876	147880	147871	147871	you	1304	" said Pen . "
147945	147946	147937	147937	I	0	" "
147952	147956	147947	147947	Women	14676	" Pendennis said . "
147975	147979	147958	147958	they	14676	" Blanche said . "
147999	148048	147996	147996	she	5823	" Laura came up , and put out her hand to Pen , to whom Pynsent made a sort of bow , appearing to be not much more graceful than that domestic instrument to which Miss Amory compared him . But Laura 's face was full of kindness . "
148060	148064	148065	148065	I	0	" she said . "
148094	148095	148092	148092	Pen	799	" "
148105	148123	148096	148096	I	0	" said Pen ; and Miss Amory nodded her head , and made her usual little curtsey . "
148136	148140	148134	148134	Laura	799	" she said . "
148154	148159	148152	148152	Blanche	1236	" said the other . "
148166	148167	148162	148162	you	799	" "
148176	148177	148168	148168	I	0	" "
148180	148311	148168	148168	I	0	" said Laura , and making a curtsey in her turn she went and placed herself under the ample wing of Lady Rockminster . Pen was delighted with his mischief . The two prettiest girls in the room were quarrelling about him . He flattered himself he had punished Miss Laura . He leaned in a dandified air , with his elbow over the wall , and talked to Blanche : he quizzed unmercifully all the men in the room - the heavy dragoons in their tight jackets - the country dandies in their queer attire - the strange toilettes of the ladies . One seemed to have a bird 's nest in her head ; another had six pounds of grapes in her hair , besides her false pearls . "
148321	148324	148168	148168	I	0	" said Pen "
148333	148403	148404	148404	Arthur	739	" In a word , he was exceedingly satirical and amusing . During the quadrille he carried on this kind of conversation with unflinching bitterness and vivacity , and kept Blanche continually laughing , both at his wickedness and jokes , which were good , and also because Laura was again their vis - a - vis , and could see and hear how merry and confidential they were . "
148411	148448	148404	148404	Arthur	739	" she whispered to Laura , across Cornet Perch 's shell - jacket , as Pen was performing cavalier seul before them , drawling through that figure with a thumb in the pocket of each waistcoat . "
148451	148455	148456	148456	Arthur	739	" said Laura . "
148458	148465	148456	148456	Arthur	739	" answered Blanche , in French . "
148475	149512	148456	148456	Arthur	739	" And now the young ladies went over to Pen 's side , and Cornet Perch performed a pas seul in his turn . He had no waistcoat pocket to put his hands into , and they looked large and swollen as they hung before him depending from the tight arms in the jacket . During the interval between the quadrille and the succeeding waltz , Pen did not take any notice of Laura , except to ask her whether her partner , Cornet Perch , was an amusing youth , and whether she liked him so well as her other partner , Mr. Pynsent . Having planted which two daggers in Laura 's gentle bosom , Mr. Pendennis proceeded to rattle on with Blanche Amory , and to make jokes good or bad , but which were always loud . Laura was at a loss to account for her cousin 's sulky behaviour , and ignorant in what she had offended him ; however , she was not angry in her turn at Pen 's splenetic mood , for she was the most good - natured and forgiving of women , and besides , an exhibition of jealousy on a man 's part is not always disagreeable to a lady . As Pen would not dance with her , she was glad to take up with the active Chevalier Strong , who was a still better performer than Pen ; and being very fond of dancing , as every brisk and innocent young girl should be , when the waltz music began she set off , and chose to enjoy herself with all her heart . Captain Broadfoot on this occasion occupied the floor in conjunction with a lady of proportions scarcely inferior to his own ; Miss Roundle , a large young woman in a strawberry - ice coloured crape dress , the daughter of the lady with the grapes in her head , whose bunches Pen had admired . And now taking his time , and with his fair partner Blanche hanging lovingly on the arm which encircled her , Mr. Arthur Pendennis set out upon his waltzing career , and felt , as he whirled round to the music , that he and Blanche were performing very brilliantly indeed . Very likely he looked to see if Miss Bell thought so too ; but she did not or would not see him , and was always engaged with her partner Captain Strong . But Pen 's triumph was not destined to last long ; and it was doomed that poor Blanche was to have yet another discomfiture on that unfortunate night . While she and Pen were whirling round as light and brisk as a couple of opera - dancers , honest Captain Broadfoot and the lady round whose large waist he was clinging , were twisting round very leisurely according to their natures , and indeed were in everybody 's way . But they were more in Pendennis 's way than in anybody 's else , for he and Blanche , whilst executing their rapid gyrations , came bolt up against the heavy dragoon and his lady , and with such force that the centre of gravity was lost by all four of the circumvolving bodies ; Captain Broadfoot and Miss Roundle were fairly upset , as was Pen himself , who was less lucky than his partner Miss Amory , who was only thrown upon a bench against a wall . But Pendennis came fairly down upon the floor , sprawling in the general ruin with Broadfoot and Miss Roundle . The Captain , though heavy , was good - natured , and was the first to burst out into a loud laugh at his own misfortune , which nobody therefore heeded . But Miss Amory was savage at her mishap ; Miss Roundle placed on her seant , and looking pitifully round , presented an object which very few people could see without laughing ; and Pen was furious when he heard the people giggling about him . He was one of those sarcastic young fellows that did not bear a laugh at his own expense , and of all things in the world feared ridicule most . As he got up Laura and Strong were laughing at him ; everybody was laughing ; Pynsent and his partner were laughing ; and Pen boiled with wrath against the pair , and could have stabbed them both on the spot . He turned away in a fury from them , and began blundering out apologies to Miss Amory . It was the other couple 's fault - the woman in pink had done it - Pen hoped Miss Amory was not hurt - would she not have the courage to take another turn ? Miss Amory in a pet said she was very much hurt indeed , and she would not take another turn ; and she accepted with great thanks a glass of water which a cavalier , who wore a blue ribbon and a three - pointed star , rushed to fetch for her when he had seen the deplorable accident . She drank the water , smiled upon the bringer gracefully , and turning her white shoulder at Mr. Pen in the most marked and haughty manner , besought the gentleman with the star to conduct her to her mamma ; and she held out her hand in order to take his arm . The man with the star trembled with delight at this mark of her favour ; he bowed over her hand , pressed it to his coat fervidly , and looked round him with triumph . It was no other than the happy Mirobolant whom Blanche had selected as an escort . But the truth is , that the young lady had never fairly looked in the artist 's face since he had been employed in her mother 's family , and had no idea but it was a foreign nobleman on whose arm she was leaning . As she went off , Pen forgot his humiliation in his surprise , and cried out , "
149521	149906	149518	149519	the cook	14456	" The instant he had uttered the words , he was sorry for having spoken them - for it was Blanche who had herself invited Mirobolant to escort her , nor could the artist do otherwise than comply with a lady 's command . Blanche in her flutter did not hear what Arthur said ; but Mirobolant heard him , and cast a furious glance at him over his shoulder , which rather amused Mr. Pen . He was in a mischievous and sulky humour ; wanting perhaps to pick a quarrel with somebody ; but the idea of having insulted a cook , or that such an individual should have any feeling of honour at all , did not much enter into the mind of this lofty young aristocrat , the apothecary 's son . It had never entered that poor artist 's head , that he as a man was not equal to any other mortal , or that there was anything in his position so degrading as to prevent him from giving his arm to a lady who asked for it . He had seen in the fetes in his own country fine ladies , not certainly demoiselles but the demoiselle Anglaise he knew was a great deal more free than the spinster in France , join in the dance with Blaise or Pierre ; and he would have taken Blanche up to Lady Clavering , and possibly have asked her to dance too , but he heard Pen 's exclamation , which struck him as if it had shot him , and cruelly humiliated and angered him . She did not know what caused him to start , and to grind a Gascon oath between his teeth . But Strong , who was acquainted with the poor fellow 's state of mind , having had the interesting information from our friend Madame Fribsby , was luckily in the way when wanted , and saying something rapidly in Spanish , which the other understood , the Chevalier begged Miss Amory to come and take an ice before she went back to Lady Clavering . Upon which the unhappy Mirobolant relinquished the arm which he had held for a minute , and with a most profound and piteous bow , fell back . "
149915	149928	149909	149909	you	5827	" Strong asked of Miss Amory , as he led her away . "
149935	149936	149518	149519	the cook	14456	" "
149942	149946	149947	149947	He	1246	" asked Blanche . "
149962	149963	149957	149957	he	1246	" "
149977	149981	149974	149974	I	0	" Strong said . "
149999	150000	149990	149990	he	1246	" "
150012	150017	150003	150003	you	0	" asked Miss Blanche . "
150031	150035	150018	150018	He	1246	" Strong answered . "
150050	150051	150036	150036	I	0	" "
150056	150060	150052	150054	Poor Monsieur Mirobolant	1280	" said Blanche . "
150070	150082	150062	150062	you	0	" - Strong asked , enjoying the idea of the mischief - "
150099	150100	150085	150085	he	1246	" "
150115	150119	150112	150113	Mr. Pen	5832	" said Blanche . "
150136	150140	150134	150134	Pynsent	1304	" Strong said . "
150153	150154	150144	150144	you	0	" "
150172	150173	150167	150167	he	5833	" "
150210	150900	150202	150202	I	0	" said the Chevalier , and sprang out of the room to the ballroom , where a scuffle and a noise of high voices was heard . The refreshment - room , in which Miss Amory now found herself , was a room set apart for the purposes of supper , which Mr. Rincer the landlord had provided for those who chose to partake , at the rate of five shillings per head . Also , refreshments of a superior class were here ready for the ladies and gentlemen of the county families who came to the ball ; but the commoner sort of persons were kept out of the room by a waiter who stood at the portal , and who said that was a select room for Lady Clavering and Lady Rockminster 's parties , and not to be opened to the public till supper - time , which was not to be until past midnight . Pynsent , who danced with his constituents ' daughters , took them and their mammas in for their refreshment there . Strong , who was manager and master of the revels wherever he went , had of course the entree - and the only person who was now occupying the room was the gentleman with the black wig and the orders in his button - hole ; the officer in the service of his Highness the Nawaub of Lucknow . This gentleman had established himself very early in the evening in this apartment , where , saying he was confoundedly thirsty , he called for a bottle of champagne . At this order the waiter instantly supposed that he had to do with a grandee , and the Colonel sate down and began to eat his supper and absorb his drink , and enter affably into conversation with anybody who entered the room . Sir Francis Clavering and Mr. Wagg found him there , when they left the ballroom , which they did pretty early - Sir Francis to go and smoke a cigar , and look at the people gathered outside the ballroom on the shore , which he declared was much better fun than to remain within ; Mr. Wagg to hang on to a Baronet 's arm , as he was always pleased to do on the arm of the greatest man in the company . Colonel Altamont had stared at these gentlemen in so odd a manner , as they passed through the ' Select ' room , that Clavering made inquiries of the landlord who he was , and hinted a strong opinion that the officer of the Nawaub 's service was drunk . Mr. Pynsent , too , had had the honour of a conversation with the servant of the Indian potentate . It was Pynsent 's cue to speak to everybody which he did , to do him justice , in the most ungracious manner ; and he took the gentleman in the black wig for some constituent , some merchant captain , or other outlandish man of the place . Mr. Pynsent , then , coming into the refreshment - room with a lady , the wife of a constituent , on his arm , the Colonel asked him if he would try a glass of Sham ? Pynsent took it with great gravity , bowed , tasted the wine , and pronounced it excellent , and with the utmost politeness retreated before Colonel Altamont . This gravity and decorum routed and surprised the Colonel more than any other kind of behaviour probably would : he stared after Pynsent stupidly , and pronounced to the landlord over the counter that he was a rum one . Mr. Rincer blushed , and hardly knew what to say . Mr. Pynsent was a county Earl 's grandson , going to set up as a Parliament man . Colonel Altamont on the other hand , wore orders and diamonds , jingled sovereigns constantly in his pocket , and paid his way like a man ; so not knowing what to say , Mr. Rincer said , "
150924	151122	150921	150922	Mrs. R.	1329	" and so got off that discussion regarding Mr. Pynsent 's qualities , into which the Nizam 's officer appeared inclined to enter . In fact , if the truth must be told , Mr. Altamont , having remained at the buffet almost all night , and employed himself very actively whilst there , had considerably flushed his brain by drinking , and he was still going on drinking , when Mr. Strong and Miss Amory entered the room . When the Chevalier ran out of the apartment , attracted by the noise in the dancing - room , the Colonel rose from his chair with his little red eyes glowing like coals , and , with rather an unsteady gait advanced towards Blanche , who was sipping her ice . She was absorbed in absorbing it , for it was very fresh and good ; or she was not curious to know what was going on in the adjoining room , although the waiters were , who ran after Chevalier Strong . So that when she looked up from her glass , she beheld this strange man staring at her out of his little red eyes . "
151132	151133	151125	151125	he	5837	" "
151141	151150	151136	151136	you	5838	" said he , after gazing at her . "
151157	151158	151155	151155	Jove	1002	" "
151166	151271	151155	151155	Jove	1002	" said Betsy , alias Blanche . But the noise in the ballroom is really becoming so loud , that we must rush back thither , and see what is the cause of the disturbance . CHAPTER XXVIII Which is both Quarrelsome and Sentimental Civil war was raging , high words passing , people pushing and squeezing together in an unseemly manner , round a window in the corner of the ballroom , close by the door through which the Chevalier Strong shouldered his way . Through the opened window , the crowd in the street below was sending up sarcastic remarks , such as "
151276	151277	151155	151155	Jove	1002	" "
151283	151349	151280	151281	the police	4053	" and the like ; and a ring of individuals , amongst whom Madame Fribsby was conspicuous , was gathered round Monsieur Alcide Mirobolant on the one side ; whilst several gentlemen and ladies surrounded our friend Arthur Pendennis on the other . Strong penetrated into this assembly , elbowing by Madame Fribsby , who was charmed at the Chevalier 's appearance , and cried , "
151356	151597	151598	151598	You	5840	" in frantic and pathetic accents . The cause of the disturbance , it appeared , was the angry little chef of Sir Francis Clavering 's culinary establishment . Shortly after Strong had quitted the room , and whilst Mr. Pen , greatly irate at his downfall in the waltz , which had made him look ridiculous in the eyes of the nation , and by Miss Amory 's behaviour to him , which had still further insulted his dignity , was endeavouring to get some coolness of body and temper , by looking out of window towards the sea , which was sparkling in the distance , and murmuring in a wonderful calm - whilst he was really trying to compose himself , and owning to himself , perhaps , that he had acted in a very absurd and peevish manner during the night - he felt a hand upon his shoulder ; and , on looking round , beheld , to his utter surprise and horror , that the hand in question belonged to Monsieur Mirobolant , whose eyes were glaring out of his pale face and ringlets at Mr. Pen . To be tapped on the shoulder by a French cook was a piece of familiarity which made the blood of the Pendennises to boil up in the veins of their descendant , and he was astounded , almost more than enraged , at such an indignity . "
151602	151612	151598	151598	You	5840	" Mirobolant said in his own language to Pen . "
151621	151628	151598	151598	You	5840	" said Pen , in English . "
151637	151646	151633	151633	you	5840	" continued the other , with a bow . "
151651	151662	151649	151649	sir	2261	" said Pen , with a stamp of his foot ; "
151669	151670	151663	151663	I	0	" "
151679	151692	151672	151672	me	0	" replied the other , rolling out his r with Gascon force , "
151713	151714	151703	151704	Monsieur Pendennis	1332	" "
151717	151726	151727	151727	You	5840	" said Pen , starting round on him . "
151742	151759	151727	151727	You	5840	" the artist said , putting his hand on his hip , and staring at Pen . "
151777	151941	151765	151765	I	0	" bawled out Mr. Pen ; and darting upon the Frenchman , he would very likely have put his threat into execution , for the window was at hand , and the artist by no means a match for the young gentleman - had not Captain Broadfoot and another heavy officer flung themselves between the combatants , - had not the ladies begun to scream , - had not the fiddles stopped , had not the crowd of people come running in that direction , - had not Laura , with a face of great alarm , looked over their heads and asked for Heaven 's sake what was wrong , - had not the opportune Strong made his appearance from the refreshment - room , and found Alcides grinding his teeth and jabbering oaths in his Galleon French , and Pen looking uncommonly wicked , although trying to appear as calm as possible , when the ladies and the crowd came up . "
151946	151956	151957	151957	I	0	" Strong asked of the chef , in Spanish . "
151963	151972	151974	151974	he	5844	" said the other , slapping his breast , "
151979	151980	151974	151974	he	5844	" "
151988	151992	151983	151983	he	5844	" asked Strong . "
151999	152012	151993	151997	Il m'a appele - Cuisinier	5845	" hissed out the little Frenchman . Strong could hardly help laughing . "
152021	152025	152018	152019	poor Chevalier	1225	" he said . "
152056	152096	152097	152098	The man	14896	" he whispered to one or two people about him ; - and others , and anxious Laura 's face visible amongst these , gathered round Pen and asked the cause of the disturbance . Pen did not know . "
152160	152164	152151	152151	I	0	" Pen said . "
152182	152187	152188	152188	I	0	" the gentlemen said . "
152202	152223	152195	152195	I	0	" Pen added and Laura was glad to hear him say that ; although some of the young bucks said , "
152243	152244	152245	152245	You	0	" "
152265	152274	152261	152261	you	0	" said Laura , coming up to him . "
152318	152354	152313	152313	you	0	" She looked all forgiveness and gentleness , like an angel , as she spoke ; and Pen took both her hands , and looked into her kind face , and said indeed he would . "
152363	152374	152313	152313	you	0	" he thought , as she stood gazing at him . "
152398	152428	152394	152395	the Frenchman	5542	" Laura asked - Would n't he stop and dance with her ? She was as anxious to keep him in the room , as he to quit it . "
152449	152505	152440	152440	I	0	" This was an affectionate , but an unlucky speech . Pen saw himself prostrate on the ground , having tumbled over Miss Roundle and the dragoon , and flung Blanche up against the wall - saw himself on the ground , and all the people laughing at him , Laura and Pynsent amongst them . "
152512	152523	152506	152506	I	0	" he replied , with a dark and determined face . "
152534	152535	152529	152529	you	0	" "
152548	152559	152539	152539	you	0	" asked Laura , with a wicked , unlucky captiousness . "
152580	152584	152586	152586	you	0	" Pen answered - "
152610	152611	152612	152612	Pen	799	" "
152622	152667	152612	152612	Pen	799	" cried out the poor girl , hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of Pen . He was glaring round in the direction of Mr. Pynsent as if he would have liked to engage that gentleman as he had done the cook . "
152680	152689	152612	152612	Pen	799	" If Laura does , we do n't . "
152702	152719	152612	152612	Pen	799	" Here again , by ill luck , Mr. Pynsent came up to Laura , and said "
152739	152740	152741	152741	I	0	" "
152751	152755	152743	152743	I	0	" Laura said . "
152762	152766	152743	152743	I	0	" said Pen . "
152790	152791	152785	152785	I	0	" "
152799	152815	152796	152797	Mr. Pendennis	739	" Pynsent said , drily - to which speech which , in fact , meant , "
152836	152863	152831	152831	I	0	" Mr. Pendennis did not vouchsafe any reply , except a bow : and in spite of Laura 's imploring looks , he left the room . "
152874	152879	152831	152831	I	0	" said Mr. Pynsent ; "
152906	152907	152916	152920	a strange congregation of people	5873	" "
152910	152914	152916	152920	a strange congregation of people	5873	" said Laura . "
152922	152926	152916	152920	a strange congregation of people	5873	" continued Pynsent . "
153020	153030	153031	153031	I	0	" - and he blushed rather as he spoke . "
153036	153040	153041	153041	I	0	" said Laura - "
153067	153068	153069	153069	Your	0	" "
153079	153083	153069	153070	Your cousin	5297	" Pynsent said . "
153143	153144	153134	153134	he	5297	" "
153155	153182	153147	153147	he	5297	" Laura said , looking up into Mr. Pynsent 's face , and dropping her eyes instantly , like a guilty little story - telling coquette . "
153195	153376	153185	153185	I	0	" Pynsent eagerly cried out , and she took his arm , and he led off his little prize in the direction of the supper - room . She had no great desire for that repast , though it was served in Rincer 's well - known style , as the county paper said , giving an account of the entertainment afterwards ; indeed , she was very distraite ; and exceedingly pained and unhappy about Pen . Captious and quarrelsome ; jealous and selfish ; fickle and violent and unjust when his anger led him astray ; how could her mother as indeed Helen had by a thousand words and hints ask her to give her heart to such a man ? and suppose she were to do so , would it make him happy ? But she got some relief at length , when , at the end of half an hour - a long half - hour it had seemed to her - a waiter brought her a little note in pencil from Pen , who said , "
153441	153586	153439	153439	PEN	799	" Laura was very thankful for this letter , and to think that there was goodness and forgiveness still in her mother 's boy . Pen went downstairs , his heart reproaching him for his absurd behaviour to Laura , whose gentle and imploring looks followed and rebuked him ; and he was scarcely out of the ballroom door but he longed to turn back and ask her pardon . But he remembered that he had left her with that confounded Pynsent . He could not apologise before him . He would compromise and forget his wrath , and make his peace with the Frenchman . The Chevalier was pacing down below in the hall of the inn when Pen descended from the ballroom ; and he came up to Pen , with all sorts of fun and mischief lighting up his jolly face . "
153597	153601	153587	153587	I	0	" he said , "
153647	153648	153638	153638	his	1246	" "
153652	153660	153661	153661	I	0	" said Pen , in a fury , "
153668	153669	153670	153670	He	1246	" "
153677	153682	153683	153683	They	5902	" replied the other . "
153693	153694	153683	153683	They	5902	" "
153711	153716	153697	153697	you	5904	" Pen asked fiercely ; "
153728	153729	153730	153730	You	5904	" "
153738	153746	153730	153730	You	5904	" cried Strong , with a laugh . "
153831	154002	154004	154004	Pen	799	" And then he told Pen the grand secret which he had had from Madame Fribsby of the violent passion under which the poor artist was labouring . When Arthur heard this tale , he broke out into a hearty laugh , in which Strong joined , and his rage against the poor cook vanished at once . He had been absurdly jealous himself all the evening , and had longed for a pretext to insult Pynsent . He remembered how jealous he had been of Oaks in his first affair ; he was ready to pardon anything to a man under a passion like that : and he went into the coffee - room where Mirobolant was waiting , with an outstretched hand , and made him a speech in French , in which he declared that he was ' sincerement fache d'avoir use une expression qui avoit pu blesser Monsieur Mirobolant , et qu'il donnoit sa parole comme un gentilhomme qu'il ne l'avoit jamais , jamais - intende , "
154015	154018	154004	154004	Pen	799	" intended , "
154035	154040	154042	154042	Strong	1225	" Bravo , bravo ! "
154077	154086	154088	154088	Alcide	1246	" Monsieur Pendennis has disproved my words himself , "
154093	154104	154088	154088	Alcide	1246	" he has shown that he is a galant homme . "
154155	154174	154139	154139	Strong	1225	" You 're a good fellow , Pendennis , and you speak French like Chateaubriand , by Jove . "
154175	154187	154189	154189	Pen	799	" I 've been accustomed to it from my youth upwards , "
154556	154574	154575	154575	he	799	" There will be plenty of time for sentiment , dear mother , when Laura comes back , "
154733	154739	154740	154740	he	799	" I shall take chambers , "
154743	154909	154740	154740	he	799	" and enter myself at an Inn of Court . With a couple of hundred pounds I shall be able to carry through the first year very well ; after that I have little doubt my pen will support me , as it is doing with several Oxbridge men now in town . I have a tragedy , a comedy , and a novel , all nearly finished , and for which I ca n't fail to get a price . And so I shall be able to live pretty well , without drawing upon my poor mother , until I have made my way at the bar . Then , some day I will come back and make her dear soul happy by marrying Laura . She is as good and as sweet - tempered a girl as ever lived , besides being really very good - looking , and the engagement will serve to steady me , - wo n't it , Ponto ? "
154949	154978	154979	154979	he	5933	" Yes , she 'll steady me , wo n't she ? And you 'll miss me when I 've gone , wo n't you , old boy ? "
155289	155296	155298	155299	this lady	14224	" Dear Pen , rouse up , "
155301	155358	155359	155359	Pen	799	" Do not be lazy . It is the most beautiful morning in the world . I have not been able to sleep since daybreak ; and Laura has been out for an hour . She is in the garden . Everybody ought to be in the garden and out on such a morning as this . "
155384	155390	155391	155391	he	799	" Oh you profound dissembler , "
155398	155422	155391	155391	he	799	" Oh you artful creature ! Can nobody escape from your wicked tricks ? and will you make your only son your victim ? "
155533	155543	155544	155544	he	5958	" I am going to tie myself for life , "
155547	155635	155544	155544	he	5958	" to please my mother . Laura is the best of women , and - and she has given me her money . I wish to Heaven I had not received it ; I wish I had not this duty to perform just yet . But as both the women have set their hearts on the match , why I suppose I must satisfy them - and now for it . A man may do worse than make happy two of the best creatures in the world . "
155925	155930	155932	155932	Laura	799	" Excuse my glove , "
155946	155958	155932	155932	Laura	799	" We are not angry again , are we , Pen ? "
155959	155967	155969	155969	Pen	799	" Why do you laugh at me ? "
155971	155990	155969	155969	Pen	799	" You did the other night , and made a fool of me to the people at Baymouth . "
155991	156002	156003	156004	the girl	15211	" My dear Arthur , I meant you no wrong , "
156007	156060	156003	156004	the girl	15211	" You and Miss Roundle looked so droll as you - as you met with your little accident , that I could not make a tragedy of it . Dear Pen , it was n't a serious fall . And , besides , it was Miss Roundle who was the most unfortunate . "
156061	156066	156069	156069	Pen	799	" Confound Miss Roundle , "
156071	156079	156081	156081	Laura	799	" I 'm sure she looked so , "
156085	156122	156081	156081	Laura	799	" You were up in an instant ; but that poor lady sitting on the ground in her red crape dress , and looking about her with that piteous face - can I ever forget her ? "
156149	156181	156142	156142	she	5968	" Well , we must not laugh at her , but I am sure we ought to laugh at you , Pen , if you were angry about such a trifle . "
156182	156192	156194	156194	Pen	799	" You should not laugh at me , Laura , "
156200	156208	156194	156194	Pen	799	" not you , of all people . "
156209	156221	156223	156223	Laura	799	" And why not ? Are you such a great man ? "
156225	156238	156239	156239	Pen	799	" Ah no , Laura , I 'm such a poor one , "
156242	156251	156239	156239	Pen	799	" Have n't you baited me enough already ? "
156252	156260	156262	156262	Laura	799	" My dear Pen , and how ? "
156264	156299	156300	156300	she	5969	" Indeed , indeed , I did n't think to vex you by such a trifle . I thought such a clever man as you could bear a harmless little joke from his sister , "
156309	156324	156300	156300	she	5969	" Dear Arthur , if I have hurt you , I beg your pardon . "
156325	156341	156342	156342	Pen	799	" It is your kindness that humiliates me more even than your laughter , Laura , "
156345	156352	156342	156342	Pen	799	" You are always my superior . "
156353	156369	156371	156372	Miss Laura	741	" What ! superior to the great Arthur Pendennis ? How can it be possible ? "
156393	156405	156390	156390	her	741	" You ca n't mean that any woman is your equal ? "
156406	156415	156417	156417	Pen	799	" Those who confer benefits should not sneer , "
156419	156469	156417	156417	Pen	799	" I do n't like my benefactor to laugh at me , Laura ; it makes the obligation very hard to bear . You scorn me because I have taken your money , and I am worthy to be scorned ; but the blow is hard coming from you . "
156470	156484	156485	156485	Laura	799	" Money ! Obligation ! For shame , Pen ; this is ungenerous , "
156491	156569	156571	156572	Miss Laura	741	" May not our mother claim everything that belongs to us ? Do n't I owe her all my happiness in this world , Arthur ? What matters about a few paltry guineas , if we can set her tender heart at rest , and ease her mind regarding you ? I would dig in the fields , I would go out and be a servant - I would die for her . You know I would , "
156577	156650	156652	156652	Laura	799	" and you call this paltry money an obligation ? Oh , Pen , it 's cruel - it 's unworthy of you to take it so ! If my brother may not share with me my superfluity , who may ? - Mine ? - I tell you it was not mine ; it was all mamma 's to do with as she chose , and so is everything I have , "
156654	156660	156652	156652	Laura	799	" my life is hers . "
156835	156843	156845	156845	Pen	799	" Is your life my mother 's ? "
156859	156873	156875	156875	he	799	" You know , Laura , what the great object of hers is ? "
156882	156887	156888	156888	she	5982	" What , Arthur ? "
156943	156958	156959	156959	Pen	799	" Our mother has one wish above all others in the world , Laura , "
156962	157191	156959	156959	Pen	799	" and I think you know it . I own to you that she has spoken to me of it ; and if you will fulfil it , dear sister , I am ready . I am but very young as yet ; but I have had so many pains and disappointments , that I am old and weary . I think I have hardly got a heart to offer . Before I have almost begun the race in life , I am a tired man . My career has been a failure ; I have been protected by those whom I by right should have protected . I own that your nobleness and generosity , dear Laura , shame me , whilst they render me grateful . When I heard from our mother what you had done for me ; that it was you who armed me and bade me go out for one struggle more ; I longed to go and throw myself at your feet , and say , ' Laura , will you come and share the contest with me ? ' Your sympathy will cheer me while it lasts . I shall have one of the tenderest and most generous creatures under heaven to aid and bear me company . Will you take me , dear Laura , and make our mother happy ? "
157192	157207	157208	157208	Laura	799	" Do you think mamma would be happy if you were otherwise , Arthur ? "
157216	157224	157226	157226	Pen	799	" And why should I not be , "
157229	157365	157226	157226	Pen	799	" with so dear a creature as you by my side ? I have not my first love to give you . I am a broken man . But indeed I would love you fondly and truly . I have lost many an illusion and ambition , but I am not without hope still . Talents I know I have , wretchedly as I have misapplied them : they may serve me yet : they would , had I a motive for action . Let me go away and think that I am pledged to return to you . Let me go and work , and hope , that you will share my success if I gain it . You have given me so much , Laura dear , will you take from me nothing ? "
157366	157376	157377	157377	Laura	799	" What have you got to give , Arthur ? "
157525	157536	157537	157537	he	799	" I give myself to you to please my mother , "
157541	157555	157537	157537	he	799	" take me , as she wishes that I should make this sacrifice . "
157601	157606	157607	157607	she	15211	" No , Arthur , "
157610	157686	157607	157607	she	15211	" our marriage would not make mamma happy , as she fancies ; for it would not content you very long . I , too , have known what her wishes were ; for she is too open to conceal anything she has at heart : and once , perhaps , I thought - but that is over now - that I could have made you - that it might have been as she wished . "
157687	157694	157696	157696	Pen	799	" You have seen somebody else , "
157712	157720	157721	157721	Laura	799	" That allusion might have been spared , "
157729	157795	157721	157721	Laura	799	" A heart which has worn out love at three - and - twenty , as yours has , you say , should have survived jealousy too . I do not condescend to say whether I have seen or encouraged any other person . I shall neither admit the charge , nor deny it : and beg you also to allude to it no more . "
157796	157826	157607	157607	she	15211	" I ask your pardon , Laura , if I have offended you : but if I am jealous , does it not prove that I have a heart ? "
157827	157942	157721	157721	Laura	799	" Not for me , Arthur . Perhaps you think you love me now but it is only for an instant , and because you are foiled . Were there no obstacle , you would feel no ardour to overcome it . No , Arthur , you do n't love me . You would weary of me in three months , as - as you do of most things ; and mamma , seeing you tired of me , would be more unhappy than at my refusal to be yours . Let us be brother and sister , Arthur , as heretofore - but no more . You will get over this little disappointment . "
157943	157948	157950	157950	Arthur	739	" I will try , "
157957	157964	157965	157965	Laura	799	" Have you not tried before ? "
157998	158138	157973	157973	she	5986	" And the next time , Arthur , when you offer yourself to a woman , do not say as you have done to me , ' I have no heart - I do not love you ; but I am ready to marry you because my mother wishes for the match . ' We require more than this in return for our love - that is , I think so . I have had no experience hitherto , and have not had the - the practice which you supposed me to have , when you spoke but now of my having seen somebody else . Did you tell your first love that you had no heart , Arthur ? or your second that you did not love her , but that she might have you if she liked ? "
158139	158147	158149	158149	Arthur	739	" What - what do you mean ? "
158159	158168	158169	158169	Laura	799	" I mean Blanche Amory , Arthur Pendennis , "
158174	158270	158169	158169	Laura	799	" It is but two months since you were sighing at her feet - making poems to her - placing them in hollow trees by the river - side . I knew all . I watched you - that is , she showed them to me . Neither one nor the other were in earnest perhaps ; but it is too soon now , Arthur , to begin a new attachment . Go through the time of your - your widowhood at least , and do not think of marrying until you are out of mourning "
158289	158386	158389	158389	she	5988	" I am angry and hurt , and I have no right to be so , and I ask your pardon in my turn now , dear Arthur . You had a right to love Blanche . She was a thousand times prettier and more accomplished than - than any girl near us here ; and you not could know that she had no heart ; and so you were right to leave her too . I ought not to rebuke you about Blanche Amory , and because she deceived you . Pardon me , Pen , "
158400	158406	158408	158408	Pen	799	" We were both jealous , "
158410	158418	158408	158408	Pen	799	" Dear Laura , let us both forgive "
158483	158491	158492	158492	she	5988	" Do not mistake me , Arthur , "
158495	158735	158492	158492	she	5988	" it can not be . You do not know what you ask , and do not be too angry with me for saying that I think you do not deserve it . What do you offer in exchange to a woman for her love , honour , and obedience ? If ever I say these words , dear Pen , I hope to say them in earnest , and by the blessing of God to keep my vow . But you - what tie binds you ? You do not care about many things which we poor women hold sacred , I do not like to think or ask how far your incredulity leads you . You offer to marry to please our mother , and own that you have no heart to give away . Oh , Arthur , what is it you offer me ? What a rash compact would you enter into so lightly ? A month ago , and you would have given yourself to another . I pray you do not trifle with your own or others ' hearts so recklessly . Go and work ; go and mend , dear Arthur , for I see your faults , and dare speak of them now : go and get fame , as you say that you can , and I will pray for my brother , and watch our dearest mother at home . "
158736	158745	158746	158746	Arthur	739	" Is that your final decision , Laura ? "
158749	158752	158754	158754	Laura	799	" Yes , "
159462	159473	159474	159474	he	2245	" I am not good enough for such a creature , "
159728	159734	159736	159736	Pen	799	" Here is my place , "
159738	159783	159736	159736	Pen	799	" here is my battle beginning , in which I must fight and conquer , or fall . I have been a boy and a dawdler as yet . Oh , I long , I long to show that I can be a man . "
160012	160024	160006	160006	he	1344	" Faith he was , and he knew him very well . "

162329	162374	162254	162255	Mr. Morgan	820	" Honly saw the outside of the door , sir , with Mr. Warrington 's name and Mr. Arthur 's painted up , and a piece of paper with ' Back at 6 ; ' but I could n't see no servant , sir . "

His mother is one of the best creatures in the world . If he has sown his wild oats , and will stick to his business , he may do well yet . Think of Charley Mirabel , the old fool , marrying that flame of his ! that Fotheringay ! He does n't like to come here until I give him leave , and puts it in a very manly nice way . I was deuced angry with him , after his Oxbridge escapades - and showed it too when he was here before - Gad , I 'll go and see him , hang me if I do n't . "

163805	163815	163816	163817	the lad	14326	" This is not a working day , sir , "
163820	163837	163838	163838	Pen	799	" We were out very late at a party last night - at Lady Whiston 's , "
163847	163887	163889	163889	Pen	799	" Everybody in town was there except you , sir ; Counts , Ambassadors , Turks , Stars and Garters - I do n't know who - it 's all in the paper - and my name , too , "
163895	163907	163908	163908	he	799	" I met an old flame of mine there , sir , "
163915	164009	163908	163908	he	799	" You know whom I mean , sir , - Lady Mirabel - to whom I was introduced over again . She shook hands , and was gracious enough . I may thank you for being out of that scrape , sir . She presented me to the husband , too - an old beau in a star and a blonde wig . He does not seem very wise . She has asked me to call on her , sir : and I may go now without any fear of losing my heart . "
164010	164023	164024	164025	the Major	2155	" What , we have had some new loves , have we ? "
164033	164039	164024	164025	the Major	2155	" Some two or three , "
164046	164069	164040	164041	Mr. Pen	6276	" But I do n't put on my grand serieux any more , sir . That goes off after the first flame . "
164070	164374	164024	164025	the Major	2155	" Very right , my dear boy . Flames and darts and passion , and that sort of thing , do very well for a lad : and you were but a lad when that affair with the Fotheringill - Fotheringay - what 's her name ? came off . But a man of the world gives up those follies . You still may do very well . You have been bit , but you may recover . You are heir to a little independence ; which everybody fancies is a doosid deal more . You have a good name , good wits , good manners , and a good person - and , begad ! I do n't see why you should n't marry a woman with money - get into Parliament - distinguish yourself , and - and , in fact , that sort of thing . Remember , it 's as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman : and a devilish deal pleasanter to sit down to a good dinner , than to a scrag of mutton in lodgings . Make up your mind to that . A woman with a good jointure is a doosid deal easier a profession than the law , let me tell you that . Look out ; I shall be on the watch for you : and I shall die content , my boy , if I can see you with a good ladylike wife , and a good carriage , and a good pair of horses , living in society , and seeing your friends , like a gentleman . Would you like to vegetate like your dear good mother at Fairoaks ? Dammy , sir ! life , without money and the best society is n't worth having . "
164391	164405	164407	164408	the lad	14326	" What would my mother and Laura say to this , I wonder ? "
164679	164716	164719	164719	Pen	799	" Look here , sir , here is Pen 's room . He is a dandy , and has got curtains to his bed , and wears shiny boots , and a silver dressing - case . "
164830	164885	164811	164812	Mr. Warrington	1359	" Might I offer you a mutton - chop , sir ? We cook 'em ourselves hot and hot : and I am teaching Pen the first principles of law , cooking , and morality at the same time . He 's a lazy beggar , sir , and too much of a dandy . "
164934	164943	164944	164944	he	1359	" Say but a word , Major Pendennis , "
164947	164968	164944	164944	he	1359	" there 's another chop in the cupboard , or Pidgeon shall go out and get you anything you like . "
165036	165042	165043	165043	Warrington	1359	" You see , sir , "
165046	165098	165043	165043	Warrington	1359	" Mrs. Flanagan is n't here to do 'em , and we ca n't employ the boy , for the little beggar is all day occupied cleaning Pen 's boots . And now for another swig at the beer . Pen drinks tea ; it 's only fit for old women . "
165099	165111	165112	165113	the Major	2155	" And so you were at Lady Whiston 's last night , "
165129	165167	165112	165113	the Major	2155	" I at Lady Whiston 's ! not such a flat , sir . I do n't care for female society . In fact it bores me . I spent my evening philosophically at the Back Kitchen . "
165168	165175	165177	165178	the Major	2155	" The Back Kitchen ? indeed ! "
165180	165191	165192	165192	Warrington	1359	" I see you do n't know what it means , "
165195	165224	165192	165192	Warrington	1359	" Ask Pen . He was there after Lady Whiston 's . Tell Major Pendennis about the Back Kitchen , Pen - do n't be ashamed of yourself . "
165891	165946	165882	165882	he	6367	" Yonder Eldon lived - upon this site Coke mused upon Littleton - here Chitty toiled - here Barnewall and Alderson joined in their famous labours - here Byles composed his great work upon bills , and Smith compiled his immortal leading cases - here Gustavus still toils , with Solomon to aid him : "
168089	168094	168096	168097	Mr. Lowton	1393	" Wait a bit , "
168105	168110	168112	168113	Mr. Lowton	1393	" Wait a bit , "
168121	168154	168155	168156	And Pen	799	" the side - tables are very full , and there 's only three benchers to eat ten dishes - if we wait , perhaps we shall get something from their table . "
168414	168427	168429	168429	Lowton	1394	" This is boiled - beef day , I believe , sir , "
168433	168445	168447	168447	Pen	799	" Upon my word , sir , I 'm not aware , "
168459	168471	168447	168447	Pen	799	" I 'm a stranger ; this is my first term ; "
168487	168650	168474	168474	Lowton	1394	" That 's Boosey the bencher , the bald one sitting under the picture and aving soup ; I wonder whether it 's turtle ? They often ave turtle . Next is Balls , the King 's Counsel , and Swettenham - Hodge and Swettenham , you know . That 's old Grump , the senior of the bar ; they say he 's dined here forty years . They often send 'em down their fish from the benchers to the senior table . Do you see those four fellows seated opposite us ? Those are regular swells - tip - top fellows , I can tell you - Mr. Trail , the Bishop of Ealing 's son , Honourable Fred . Ringwood , Lord Cinqbar 's brother , you know . He 'll have a good place , I bet any money ; and Bob Suckling , who 's always with him - a high fellow too . Ha ! ha ! "
168658	168663	168665	168665	Pen	799	" What is it ? "
168670	168682	168683	168683	Lowton	1394	" I say , I like to mess with those chaps , "
168699	168703	168705	168705	Pen	799	" And why ? "
168707	168831	168705	168705	Pen	799	" Why ! they do n't come down here to dine , you know , they only make believe to dine . They dine here , Law bless you ! They go to some of the swell clubs , or else to some grand dinner - party . You see their names in the Morning Post at all the fine parties in London . Why , I bet anything that Ringwood has his cab , or Trail his Brougham he 's a devil of a fellow , and makes the bishop 's money spin , I can tell you at the corner of Essex Street at this minute . They dine ! They wo n't dine these two hours , I dare say . "
168832	168851	168852	168852	Pen	799	" But why should you like to mess with them , if they do n't eat any dinner ? "
168858	168867	168852	168852	Pen	799	" There 's plenty , is n't there ? "
168868	168874	168876	168876	Lowton	1394	" How green you are , "
168878	168928	168876	168876	Lowton	1394	" Excuse me , but you are green . They do n't drink any wine , do n't you see , and a fellow gets the bottle to himself if he likes it when he messes with those three chaps . That 's why Corkoran got in with 'em . "
168929	168943	168944	168944	Pen	799	" Ah , Mr. Lowton , I see you are a sly fellow , "
168990	168999	169000	169000	he	799	" There 's a lot of Irish here , "
169003	169063	169064	169064	Lowton	1393	" that Corkoran 's one , and I ca n't say I like him . You see that handsome chap with the blue neck - cloth , and pink shirt , and yellow waistcoat , that 's another ; that 's Molloy Maloney of Ballymaloney , and nephew to Major - General Sir Hector O'Dowd , he , he , "
169074	169188	169064	169064	Lowton	1393	" He 's always bragging about his uncle ; and came into Hall in silver - striped trousers the day he had been presented . That other near him , with the long black hair , is a tremendous rebel . By Jove , sir , to hear him at the Forum it makes your blood freeze ; and the next is an Irishman , too , Jack Finucane , reporter of a newspaper . They all stick together , those Irish . It 's your turn to fill your glass . What ? you wo n't have any port ? Do n't like port with your dinner ? Here 's your health . "
169422	169430	169431	169431	he	1393	" We ought to know each other , "
169434	169446	169431	169431	he	1393	" We 're both Boniface men ; my name 's Warrington . "
169447	169455	169456	169456	Pen	799	" Are you St - - Warrington ? "
169468	169474	169475	169475	he	799	" Stunning Warrington - yes , "
169478	169498	169475	169475	he	799	" I recollect you in your freshman 's term . But you appear to have quite cut me out . "
169499	169507	169509	169509	Pen	799	" The college talks about you still , "
169521	169550	169509	169509	Pen	799	" The bargeman you thrashed , Bill Simes , do n't you remember , wants you up again at Oxbridge . The Miss Notleys , the haberdashers - - "

169558	169574	169556	169556	Warrington	1372	" glad to make your acquaintance , Pendennis . Heard a good deal about you . "
169665	169680	169681	169681	Pen	799	" I thought of going home to dress , and hear Grisi in Norma , "
169684	169693	169694	169694	he	799	" Are you going to meet anybody there ? "
169700	169709	169697	169697	Pen	799	" No - only to hear the music , "
169716	169730	169732	169732	Warrington	1372	" You had much better come home and smoke a pipe with me , "
169735	169761	169732	169732	Warrington	1372	" a very short one . Come , I live close by in Lamb Court , and we 'll talk over Boniface and old times . "
170195	170199	170200	170200	he	1372	" In society , "
170205	170331	170200	170200	he	1372	" everybody is the same , wears the same dress , eats and drinks , and says the same things ; one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another , one Miss at a ball exactly resembles another , whereas there 's character here . I like to talk with the strongest man in England , or the man who can drink the most beer in England , or with that tremendous republican of a hatter , who thinks Thistlewood was the greatest character in history . I like better gin - and - water than claret . I like a sanded floor in Carnaby Market better than a chalked one in Mayfair . I prefer Snobs , I own it . "

If ye want any thrifle , heark ye , there 's poor old Jack Costigan has got a guinea or two in his pocket - and , be heavens ! you shall never want , Awthur , me dear boy . What 'll ye have ? John , come hither , and look aloive ; give this gentleman a glass of punch , and I 'll pay for't . - Your friend ? I 've seen him before . Permit me to have the honour of making meself known to ye , sir , and requesting ye'll take a glass of punch . "

172952	173083	172937	172938	Mr. Hodgen	1418	" and he 's a precious deal more than half seas over . He has already tried that ' Little Doodeen ' of his , and broke it , too , just before I sang ' King Death .

I fear the Captain 's very bad to - night . He breaks out on a pay - day ; and I shall have the deuce 's own trouble in getting home . We live together . We still hang on , sir , in partnership , though Miss Em - though my lady Mirabel has left the firm . - And so you remember old times , do you ?

A black - vizarded ruffian whom we will unmask , who signs the forged name of Trefoil , is at present one of the chief bravoes and bullies in our contemporary 's establishment . He is the eunuch who brings the bowstring , and strangles at the order of the Day . We can convict this cowardly slave , and propose to do so . The charge which he has brought against Lord Bangbanagher , because he is a Liberal Irish peer , and against the Board of Poor Law Guardians of the Bangbanagher Union , is , "

174767	174794	174765	174765	Mick	1423	" That was fine writing when the Docthor wrote in the Phaynix , and he and Condy Roony blazed away at each other day after day . "

They are the best friends in the world , I believe , in spite of their newspaper controversies ; and though they cry out against the English for abusing their country , by Jove they abuse it themselves more in a single article than we should take the pains to do in a dozen volumes . How are you , Doolan ? "
174935	175091	175094	175094	he	6763	" Your servant , Mr. Warrington - Mr. Pendennis , I am delighted to have the honour of seeing ye again . The night 's journey on the top of the Alacrity was one of the most agreeable I ever enjoyed in my life , and it was your liveliness and urbanity that made the trip so charming . I have often thought over that happy night , sir , and talked over it to Mrs. Doolan . I have seen your elegant young friend , Mr. Foker , too , here , sir , not unfrequently . He is an occasional frequenter of this hostelry , and a right good one it is . Mr. Pendennis , when I saw you I was on the Tom and Jerry Weekly Paper ; I have now the honour to be sub - editor of the Dawn , one of the best - written papers of the empire "

175215	175358	175207	175207	Archer	1436	" where I was wanted . Get me some supper , John - something substantial . I hate your grandees who give you nothing to eat . If it had been at Apsley House , it would have been quite different . The Duke knows what I like , and says to the Groom of the Chambers , ' Martin , you will have some cold beef , not too much done , and a pint bottle of pale ale , and some brown sherry , ready in my study as usual ; - Archer is coming here this evening . ' The Duke does n't eat supper himself , but he likes to see a man enjoy a hearty meal , and he knows that I dine early . A man ca n't live upon air , be hanged to him . "
175359	175371	175372	175372	Warrington	1359	" Let me introduce you to my friend , Mr. Pendennis , "
175379	175412	175372	175372	Warrington	1359	" Pen , this is Mr Archer , whom you have heard me talk about . You must know Pen 's uncle , the Major , Archer , you who know everybody ? "
175413	175425	175426	175426	Archer	1436	" Dined with him the day before yesterday at Gaunt House , "
175429	175445	175426	175426	Archer	1436	" We were four - the French Ambassador , Steyne , and we two commoners . "
175446	175456	175372	175372	Warrington	1359	" Why , my uncle is in Scot - - "
175481	175499	175500	175500	Archer	1436	" It was about the same business that I have been to the palace to - night , "
175505	175586	175500	175500	Archer	1436	" and where I 've been kept four hours , in an anteroom , with nothing but yesterday 's Times , which I knew by heart , as I wrote three of the leading articles myself ; and though the Lord Chamberlain came in four times , and once holding the royal teacup and saucer in his hand , he did not so much as say to me , ' Archer , will you have a cup of tea ? ' "
175587	175597	175599	175599	Warrington	1359	" Indeed ! what is in the wind now ? "
175608	175629	175604	175604	Pen	799	" You know , I suppose , that when there is anything wrong at Court they always send for Archer . "
175630	175636	175638	175639	Mr. Archer	1436	" There is something wrong , "
175641	175812	175638	175639	Mr. Archer	1436	" and as the story will be all over the town in a day or two I do n't mind telling it . At the last Chantilly races , where I rode Brian Boru for my old friend the Duke de Saint Cloud - the old King said to me , Archer , I 'm uneasy about Saint Cloud . I have arranged his marriage with the Princess Marie Cunegonde ; the peace of Europe depends upon it - for Russia will declare war if the marriage does not take place , and the young fool is so mad about Madame Massena , Marshal Massena 's wife , that he actually refuses to be a party to the marriage . Well , Sir , I spoke to Saint Cloud , and having got him into pretty good humour by winning the race , and a good bit of money into the bargain , he said to me , ' Archer , tell the Governor I 'll think of it . ' "
175813	175822	175824	175824	Pen	799	" How do you say Governor in French ? "
175834	175866	175867	175867	Archer	1436	" Oh , we speak in English - I taught him when we were boys , and I saved his life at Twickenham , when he fell out of a punt , "
175870	175904	175867	175867	Archer	1436	" I shall never forget the Queen 's looks as I brought him out of the water . She gave me this diamond ring , and always calls me Charles to this day . "
175905	175917	175918	175918	Warrington	1359	" Madame Massena must be rather an old woman , Archer , "
175921	175937	175938	175938	Archer	1436	" Dev'lish old - old enough to be his grandmother ; I told him so , "
175943	175994	175938	175938	Archer	1436	" But those attachments for old women are the deuce and all . That 's what the King feels : that 's what shocks the poor Queen so much . They went away from Paris last Tuesday night , and are living at this present moment at Jaunay 's Hotel . "
175995	176005	176007	176007	Warrington	1359	" Has there been a private marriage , Archer ? "
176009	176020	176021	176022	Mr. Archer	1436	" Whether there has or not I do n't know , "
176025	176081	176021	176022	Mr. Archer	1436	" all I know is that I was kept waiting for four hours at the palace ; that I never saw a man in such a state of agitation as the King of Belgium when he came out to speak to me , and that I 'm devilish hungry - and here comes some supper . "
176082	176092	176094	176094	Warrington	1359	" He has been pretty well to - night , "
176103	176161	176094	176094	Warrington	1359	" but I have known him in much greater force , and keeping a whole room in a state of wonder . Put aside his archery practice , that man is both able and honest - a good man of business , an excellent friend , admirable to his family as husband , father , and son . "
176162	176177	176021	176022	Mr. Archer	1436	" What is it makes him pull the long bow in that wonderful manner ? "
176178	176183	176185	176185	Warrington	1359	" An amiable insanity , "
176187	176230	176185	176185	Warrington	1359	" He never did anybody harm by his talk , or said evil of anybody . He is a stout politician too , and would never write a word or do an act against his party , as many of us do . "
176231	176239	176241	176241	Pen	799	" Of us ! Who are we ? "
176243	176251	176241	176241	Pen	799	" Of what profession is Mr. Archer ? "
176252	176267	176269	176269	Warrington	1359	" Of the Corporation of the Goosequill - of the Press , my boy , "
176271	176277	176269	176269	Warrington	1359	" of the fourth estate . "
176278	176290	176291	176291	Pendennis	739	" Are you , too , of the craft , then ? "
176294	176303	176305	176306	the other	14365	" We will talk about that another time , "
176379	176386	176387	176387	Warrington	1359	" Look at that , Pen , "
176390	176572	176387	176387	Warrington	1359	" There she is - the great engine - she never sleeps . She has her ambassadors in every quarter of the world - her couriers upon every road . Her officers march along with armies , and her envoys walk into statesmen 's cabinets . They are ubiquitous . Yonder journal has an agent , at this minute , giving bribes at Madrid ; and another inspecting the price of potatoes in Covent Garden . Look ! here comes the Foreign Express galloping in . They will be able to give news to Downing Street to - morrow : funds will rise or fall , fortunes be made or lost ; Lord B. will get up , and , holding the paper in his hand , and seeing the noble marquis in his place , will make a great speech ; and - and Mr. Doolan will be called away from his supper at the Back Kitchen ; for he is foreign sub - editor , and sees the mail on the newspaper sheet before he goes to his own . "
177191	177200	177202	177202	Pen	799	" It is the last rose of summer , "
177204	177226	177228	177228	he	799	" its blooming companions have gone long ago ; and behold the last one of the garland has shed its leaves ; "
177264	177271	177272	177272	Pen	799	" Impecuniosity will do you good , "
177288	177542	177272	177272	Pen	799	" I do n't know anything more wholesome for a man - for an honest man , mind you - for another , the medicine loses its effect - than a state of tick . It is an alterative and a tonic ; it keeps your moral man in a perpetual state of excitement : as a man who is riding at a fence , or has his opponent 's single - stick before him , is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face , and braces himself to repulse or overcome it ; a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any , and nerves you to grapple with fortune . You will discover what a number of things you can do without when you have no money to buy them . You wo n't want new gloves and varnished boots , eau de Cologne and cabs to ride in . You have been bred up as a molly - coddle , Pen , and spoilt by the women . A single man who has health and brains , and ca n't find a livelihood in the world , does n't deserve to stay there . Let him pay his last halfpenny and jump over Waterloo Bridge . Let him steal a leg of mutton and be transported and get out of the country - he is not fit to live in it . Dixi ; I have spoken . Give us another pull at the pale ale . "
177555	177559	177272	177272	Pen	799	" said Pen . "
177595	177601	177626	177627	A gentleman	2230	" Warrington burst out laughing . "
177609	177613	177603	177603	we	6821	" he said , "
177643	177644	177626	177627	A gentleman	2230	" "
177648	177652	177626	177627	A gentleman	2230	" cried Pen . "
177705	177706	177733	177733	Bloundell	898	" "
177710	177716	177733	177733	Bloundell	898	" said Pen , growling . "
177926	177927	177928	177929	Hang gallypots	1447	" "
177931	177935	177928	177929	Hang gallypots	1447	" cried Pen . "
177958	177959	177955	177955	you	0	" "
177968	177972	177964	177966	our own correspondent	6851	" Warrington said . "
178096	178097	178071	178071	her	3005	" "
178103	178107	178071	178071	her	3005	" asked Pen . "
178116	178121	178110	178110	I	0	" said the other . "
178141	178149	178135	178135	my	0	" and here Warrington 's countenance fell . "
178236	178259	178230	178230	I	0	" Warrington said , and showed Pen a long lean purse , with but a few sovereigns at one end of it . "
178267	178271	178272	178272	I	0	" said Pen . "
178275	178279	178272	178272	I	0	" said Warrington . "
178291	178299	178287	178287	I	0	" he added , with a blush . "
178350	178358	178359	178359	I	0	" And he turned over some sheets . "
178377	178443	178375	178375	editor	6865	" And Warrington , going with Pendennis to the club one day , called for a file of the Dawn , and pointed with his finger silently to one or two articles , which Pen read with delight . He had no difficulty in recognising the style afterwards - the strong thoughts and curt periods , the sense , the satire , and the scholarship . "
178451	178465	178375	178375	editor	6865	" said Pen , with a genuine admiration of his friend 's powers . "
178496	178497	178485	178485	I	0	" "
178518	178527	178499	178499	you	1359	" the other said , good - naturedly . "
178624	178655	178619	178619	Pen	799	" and so speaking , Warrington stretched out his broad hand , and clapped Pen on the shoulder . Arthur was so delighted that the tears came into his eyes . "
178665	178669	178663	178663	Warrington	1359	" he said . "
178677	178682	178670	178670	I	0	" said the other . "
178761	178799	178752	178752	I	0	" and a glance of extreme kindness and melancholy passed out of Warrington 's dark eyes . Pen was too much pleased with his own thoughts to perceive the sadness of the friend who was complimenting him . "
178805	178809	178811	178811	you	1359	" he said , "
178884	178893	178896	178897	young goose	6882	" Warrington burst into a roar of laughter . "
178899	178904	178896	178897	young goose	6882	" he yelled out - "
179044	179045	179039	179039	I	0	" "
179049	179060	179061	179061	I	0	" said Pen , bouncing up and stamping his foot , "
179076	179539	179061	179061	I	0	" Warrington only laughed the more , and blew twenty - four puffs rapidly out of his pipe by way of reply to Pen . An opportunity for showing his skill presented itself before very long . That eminent publisher , Mr. Bacon formerly Bacon and Bungay of Paternoster Row , besides being the proprietor of the legal Review , in which Mr. Warrington wrote , and of other periodicals of note and gravity , used to present to the world every year a beautiful gilt volume called the Spring Annual , edited by the Lady Violet Lebas , and numbering amongst its contributors not only the most eminent , but the most fashionable , poets of our time . Young Lord Dodo 's poems first appeared in this miscellany - the Honourable Percy Popjoy , whose chivalrous ballads have obtained him such a reputation - Bedwin Sands 's Eastern Ghazuls , and many more of the works of our young nobles , were fast given to the world in the Spring Annual , which has since shared the fate of other vernal blossoms , and perished out of the world . The book was daintily illustrated with pictures of reigning beauties , or other prints of a tender and voluptuous character ; and , as these plates were prepared long beforehand , requiring much time in engraving , it was the eminent poets who had to write to the plates , and not the painters who illustrated the poems . One day , just when this volume was on the eve of publication , it chanced that Mr. Warrington called in Paternoster Row to talk with Mr. Hack , Mr. Bacon 's reader and general manager of publications - for Mr. Bacon , not having the least taste in poetry or in literature of any kind , wisely employed the services of a professional gentleman . Warrington , then , going into Mr. Hack 's room on business of his own , found that gentleman with a bundle of proof plates and sheets of the Spring Annual before him , and glanced at some of them . Percy Popjoy had written some verses to illustrate one of the pictures , which was called The Church Porch . A Spanish damsel was hastening to church with a large prayer - book ; a youth in a cloak was hidden in a niche watching this young woman . The picture was pretty : but the great genius of Percy Popjoy had deserted him , for he had made the most execrable verses which ever were perpetrated by a young nobleman . Warrington burst out laughing as he read the poem : and Mr. Hack laughed too but with rather a rueful face . - "
179545	179549	179061	179061	I	0	" he said , "
179630	179631	179622	179623	The governor	4881	" "
179645	179649	179634	179640	a fellow who would do some verses	6892	" said Warrington . "
179680	179681	179672	179672	You	0	" "
179685	179709	179672	179672	You	0	" said Mr. Hack ; and Warrington , having despatched his own business , went home to Mr. Pen , plate in hand . "
179731	179732	179741	179742	A lady	2757	" "
179770	179771	179741	179742	A lady	2757	" "
179774	179778	179741	179742	A lady	2757	" said Warrington . "
179793	179794	179741	179742	A lady	2757	" "
179801	179805	179797	179797	I	0	" said Pen . "
179814	179845	179807	179807	I	0	" said Warrington , and left Mr. Pen in a brown study . When Warrington came home that night , at a very late hour , the verses were done . "
179850	179854	179855	179855	I	0	" said Pen . "
179869	179870	179874	179874	they	6898	" "
179877	180057	179874	179874	they	6898	" said Warrington , after reading them ; they ran as follows : - The Church Porch Although I enter not , Yet round about the spot Sometimes I hover , And at the sacred gate , With longing eyes I wait , Expectant of her . The Minster bell tolls out Above the city 's rout And noise and humming They 've stopp'd the chiming bell , I hear the organ 's swell She 's coming , she 's coming ! My lady comes at last , Timid and stepping fast , And hastening hither , With modest eyes downcast . She comes - she 's here - she 's past . May Heaven go with her ! Kneel undisturb'd , fair saint , Pour out your praise or plaint Meekly and duly . I will not enter there , To sully your pure prayer With thoughts unruly . But suffer me to pace Round the forbidden place , Lingering a minute , Like outcast spirits , who wait And see through Heaven 's gate Angels within it . "
180067	180071	180064	180065	young fellow	6034	" asked Warrington . "
180111	180798	180829	180835	A man of property in the West	6904	" Pen examined his portfolio and found another ballad which he thought might figure with advantage in the Spring Annual , and consigning these two precious documents to Warrington , the pair walked from the Temple to the famous haunt of the Muses and their masters , Paternoster Row . Bacon 's shop was an ancient low - browed building , with a few of the books published by the firm displayed in the windows , under a bust of my Lord of Verulam , and the name of Mr. Bacon in brass on the private door . Exactly opposite to Bacon 's house was that of Mr. Bungay , which was newly painted and elaborately decorated in the style of the seventeenth century , so that you might have fancied stately Mr. Evelyn passing over the threshold , or curious Mr. Pepys examining the books in the window . Warrington went into the shop of Mr. Bacon , but Pen stayed without . It was agreed that his ambassador should act for him entirely ; and the young fellow paced up and down the street in a very nervous condition , until he should learn the result of the negotiation . Many a poor devil before him has trodden those flags , with similar cares and anxieties at his heels , his bread and his fame dependent upon the sentence of his magnanimous patrons of the Row . Pen looked at all the wonders of all the shops , and the strange variety of literature which they exhibit . In this were displayed black - letter volumes and books in the clear pale types of Aldus and Elzevir : in the next , you might see the Penny Horrific Register ; the Halfpenny Annals of Crime and History of the most celebrated murderers of all countries , The Raff 's Magazine , The Larky Swell , and other publications of the penny press ; whilst at the next window , portraits of ill - favoured individuals , with fac - similes of the venerated signatures of the Reverend Grimes Wapshot , the Reverend Elias Howle , and the works written and the sermons preached by them , showed the British Dissenter where he could find mental pabulum . Hard by would be a little casement hung with emblems , with medals and rosaries with little paltry prints of saints gilt and painted , and books of controversial theology , by which the faithful of the Roman opinion might learn a short way to deal with Protestants , at a penny apiece , or ninepence the dozen for distribution ; whilst in the very next window you might see ' Come out of Rome , ' a sermon preached at the opening of the Shepherd 's Bush College , by John Thomas Lord Bishop of Ealing . Scarce an opinion but has its expositor and its place of exhibition in this peaceful old Paternoster Row , under the toll of the bells of Saint Paul . Pen looked in at all the windows and shops , as a gentleman who is going to have an interview with the dentist examines the books on the waiting - room table . He remembered them afterwards . It seemed to him that Warrington would never come out ; and indeed the latter was engaged for some time in pleading his friend 's cause . Pen 's natural conceit would have swollen immensely if he could but have heard the report which Warrington gave of him . It happened that Mr. Bacon himself had occasion to descend to Mr. Hack 's room whilst Warrington was talking there , and Warrington , knowing Bacon 's weaknesses , acted upon them with great adroitness in his friend 's behalf . In the first place , he put on his hat to speak to Bacon , and addressed him from the table on which he seated himself . Bacon liked to be treated with rudeness by a gentleman , and used to pass it on to his inferiors as boys pass the mark . "
180809	180813	180806	180807	Mr. Bacon	1450	" Warrington said . "
180882	180883	180874	180874	he	739	" "
180905	180910	180902	180902	me	0	" said Mr. Bacon . "
180956	180957	180964	180964	he	1455	" "
180975	180976	180964	180964	he	1455	" "
181032	181033	181035	181035	they	6915	" "
181043	181048	181038	181039	Mr. Warrington	1359	" said the publisher . "
181073	181074	181071	181071	sir	2261	" "
181090	181099	181087	181088	Mr. Warrington	1359	" the publisher interposed , with a sigh . "
181137	181138	181132	181132	sir	2261	" "
181152	181225	181143	181143	I	0	" Warrington said , and rose from the table . This threat was too much for Mr. Bacon , who was instantly ready to accede to any reasonable proposal of Mr. Warrington 's , and finally asked his manager what those proposals were ? When he heard that the negotiation only related as yet to a couple of ballads , which Mr. Warrington offered for the Spring Annual , Mr. Bacon said , "
181236	181281	181231	181231	him	2526	" and with this paper Warrington went out to his friend , and placed it , grinning , in Pen 's hands . Pen was as elated as if somebody had left him a fortune . He offered Warrington a dinner at Richmond instantly . "
181301	181302	181303	181303	They	6925	" "
181313	181317	181303	181303	They	6925	" said Warrington , "
181333	181334	181336	181336	God	1867	" "
181341	181345	181336	181336	God	1867	" cried Arthur , "
181378	181379	181380	181380	I	0	" "
181408	181419	181429	181429	Pen	799	" said Warrington , pleased with the other 's exultation . "
181445	181551	181556	181556	sir	2261	" They had a magnum of claret at dinner at the club that day , at Pen 's charges . It was long since he had indulged in such a luxury , but Warrington would not baulk him : and they drank together to the health of the Spring Annual . It never rains but it pours , according to the proverb ; so very speedily another chance occurred , by which Mr. Pen was to be helped in his scheme of making a livelihood . Warrington one day threw him a letter across the table , which was brought by a printer 's boy , "
181557	181599	181553	181554	Captain Shandon	1433	" - the little emissary said : and then went and fell asleep on his accustomed bench in the passage . He paid many a subsequent visit there , and brought many a message to Pen . F. P. Tuesday Morning . "
181700	181723	181682	181682	We	6934	" Shall B. come and see you , or can you look in upon me here ? - Ever yours , C. S. "
181724	181729	181730	181730	Warrington	1359	" Some more opposition , "
181740	182067	181730	181730	Warrington	1359	" Bungay and Bacon are at daggers drawn ; each married the sister of the other , and they were for some time the closest friends and partners . Hack says it was Mrs. Bungay who caused all the mischief between the two ; whereas Shandon , who reads for Bungay a good deal , says Mrs. Bacon did the business ; but I do n't know which is right , Peachum or Lockit . But since they have separated , it is a furious war between the two publishers ; and no sooner does one bring out a book of travels , or poems , a magazine or periodical , quarterly , or monthly , or weekly , or annual , but the rival is in the field with something similar . I have heard poor Shandon tell with great glee how he made Bungay give a grand dinner at Blackwall to all his writers , by saying that Bacon had invited his corps to an entertainment at Greenwich . When Bungay engaged your celebrated friend Mr. Wagg to edit the ' Londoner , ' Bacon straightway rushed off and secured Mr. Grindle to give his name to the ' Westminster Magazine . ' When Bacon brought out his comic Irish novel of ' Barney Brallaghan , ' off went Bungay to Dublin , and produced his rollicking Hibernian story of ' Looney MacTwolter . ' When Doctor Hicks brought out his ' Wanderings in Mesopotamia ' under Bacon 's auspices , Bungay produced Professor Sandiman 's ' Researches in Zahara ; ' and Bungay is publishing his ' Pall Mall Gazette ' as a counterpoise to Bacon 's ' Whitehall Review . ' Let us go and hear about the ' Gazette . ' There may be a place for you in it , Pen , my boy . We will go and see Shandon . We are sure to find him at home . "
182068	182074	182076	182076	Pen	799	" Where does he live ? "
182078	182084	182085	182085	Warrington	1359	" In the Fleet Prison , "
182088	182108	182085	182085	Warrington	1359	" And very much at home he is there , too . He is the king of the place . "
182379	182387	182389	182390	Mr. Shandon	1477	" This is the Captain 's door , "
182793	182801	182803	182803	she	6988	" Papa 's a very clever man , "
182805	182810	182803	182803	she	6988	" mamma says so . "
182811	182816	182818	182819	Mr. Bungay	1457	" Oh , very , "
182821	182833	182835	182836	the child	15536	" And you 're a very rich man , Mr. Bundy , "
182844	182847	182849	182849	Mamma	1205	" Mary ! "
182855	182861	182862	182862	Bungay	1457	" Oh , never mind , "
182892	182893	182880	182880	he	1457	" "
182909	183007	182902	182902	you	0	" asked the child . Mamma at this began to wipe her eyes with the work on which she was employed . The poor lady had hung curtains up in the room , had brought the children 's picture and placed it there , and had made one or two attempts to ornament it . Mamma began to cry ; Mr. Bungay turned red , and looked fiercely out of his bloodshot little eyes ; Shandon 's pen went on , and Pen and Warrington arrived with their knock . Captain Shandon looked up from his work . "
183016	183020	183013	183014	Mr. Warrington	1359	" he said . "
183042	183117	183118	183118	I	0	" and away went the pen again . Warrington pulled forward an old portmanteau - the only available seat - and sate down on it , with a bow to Mrs. Shandon and a nod to Bungay : the child came and looked at Pen solemnly and in a couple of minutes the swift scribbling ceased ; and Shandon , turning the desk over on the bed , stooped and picked up the papers . "
183124	183128	183118	183118	I	0	" said he . "
183139	183140	183118	183118	I	0	" "
183149	183162	183163	183163	I	0	" Mr. Bungay said , laying down a five - pound note . "
183184	183185	183181	183181	I	0	" "
183197	183304	183305	183307	The ancient monarchy	6995	" said Shandon , and he eagerly clapped the note into his pocket . CHAPTER XXXIII Which is passed in the Neighbourhood of Ludgate Hill Our imprisoned Captain announced , in smart and emphatic language in his prospectus , that the time had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of England to band together in defence of their common rights and their glorious order , menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions , by intestine radicalism , by the artful calumnies of mill - owners and cotton - lords , and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led . "
183311	183316	183318	183321	a ferocious republican rabble	6996	" the Captain said , "
183436	183441	183428	183431	the kings of France	7004	" Mr. Shandon remarked , "
183518	183547	183548	183548	You	7015	" Bungay nodded his head in a knowing manner , and winked his eyes when the Captain came to the Waterloo passage : and Warrington burst out laughing . "
183558	183569	183548	183548	You	7015	" Shandon said , slily looking up from his papers - "
183603	183758	183768	183769	Mr. Bungay	1457	" The Captain then went on to confess , with much candour , that up to the present time the gentlemen of England , confident of their right , and careless of those who questioned it , had left the political interest of their order as they did the management of their estates , or the settlement of their legal affairs , to persons affected to each peculiar service , and had permitted their interests to be represented in the press by professional proctors and advocates . That time Shandon professed to consider was now gone by : the gentlemen of England must be their own champions : the declared enemies of their order were brave , strong , numerous , and uncompromising . They must meet their foes in the field : they must not be belied and misrepresented by hireling advocates : they must not have Grub Street publishing Gazettes from Whitehall ; "
183771	183789	183768	183769	Mr. Bungay	1457	" said Shandon , turning round to the publisher . Bungay clapped his stick on the floor . "
183799	183822	183768	183769	Mr. Bungay	1457	" he said with exultation : and turning to Warrington , wagged his dull head more vehemently than ever , and said , "
183843	183897	183841	183841	him	1457	" The prospectus - writer went on to say that some gentlemen , whose names were , for obvious reasons , not brought before the public at which Mr. Warrington began to laugh again , had determined to bring forward a journal , of which the principles were so - and - so . "
183912	183925	183926	183926	They	7022	" cried out Captain Shandon , flourishing his paper with a grin . "
184025	184026	184010	184012	some of them	18648	" "
184031	184036	184010	184012	some of them	18648	" asked Mr. Bungay . "
184049	184057	184010	184012	some of them	18648	" Pen said , with great gravity . "
184067	184077	184064	184065	Mr. Bungay	1457	" Warrington said , on which the publisher answered , "
184085	184093	184081	184081	I	0	" and yawned , though he said , "
184099	184100	184010	184012	some of them	18648	" "
184137	184138	184105	184105	they	19624	" "
184141	184163	184105	184105	they	19624	" cried Warrington . The little child stood wondering ; the lady was working silently , and looking with fond admiration . "
184170	184267	184268	184268	You	7034	" said Warrington , and patted the child 's fair curls with his large hand . But she shrank back from his rough caress , and preferred to go and take refuge at Pen 's knee , and play with his fine watch - chain : and Pen was very much pleased that she came to him ; for he was very soft - hearted and simple , though he concealed his gentleness under a shy and pompous demeanour . So she clambered up on his lap , whilst her father continued to read his programme . "
184272	184279	184268	184268	You	7034	" the Captain said to Warrington , "
184310	184315	184305	184305	We	7037	" he went on , "
184535	185235	185236	185236	I	0	" Mr. Shandon then went on with much modesty to descant upon the literary and fashionable departments of the Pall Mall Gazette , which were to be conducted by gentlemen of acknowledged reputation ; men famous at the Universities at which Mr Pendennis could scarcely help laughing and blushing , known at the Clubs , and of the Society which they described . He pointed out delicately to advertisers that there would be no such medium as the Pall Mall Gazette for giving publicity to their sales ; and he eloquently called upon the nobility of England , the baronetage of England , the revered clergy of England , the bar of England , the matrons , the daughters , the homes and hearths of England , to rally round the good old cause ; and Bungay at the conclusion of the reading woke up from a second snooze in which he had indulged himself , and again said it was all right . The reading of the prospectus concluded , the gentlemen present entered into some details regarding the political and literary management of the paper , and Mr. Bungay sate by listening and nodding his head , as if he understood what was the subject of their conversation , and approved of their opinions . Bungay 's opinions , in truth , were pretty simple . He thought the Captain could write the best smashing article in England . He wanted the opposition house of Bacon smashed , and it was his opinion that the Captain could do that business . If the Captain had written a letter of Junius on a sheet of paper , or copied a part of the Church Catechism , Mr. Bungay would have been perfectly contented , and have considered that the article was a smashing article . And he pocketed the papers with the greatest satisfaction : and he not only paid for the MS . , as we have seen , but he called little Mary to him , and gave her a penny as he went away . The reading of the manuscript over , the party engaged in general conversation , Shandon leading with a jaunty fashionable air in compliment to the two guests who sate with him and , and who , by their appearance and manner , he presumed to be persons of the beau monde . He knew very little indeed of the great world , but he had seen it , and made the most of what he had seen . He spoke of the characters of the day , and great personages of the fashion , with easy familiarity and jocular allusions , as if it had been his habit to live amongst them . He told anecdotes of their private life , and of conversations he had had , and entertainments at which he had been present , and at which such and such a thing occurred . Pen was amused to hear the shabby prisoner in a tattered dressing - gown talking glibly about the great of the land . Mrs. Shandon was always delighted when her husband told these tales , and believed in them fondly every one . She did not want to mingle in the fashionable world herself , she was not clever enough ; but the great Society was the very place for her Charles : he shone in it : he was respected in it . Indeed , Shandon had once been asked to dinner by the Earl of X ; his wife treasured the invitation - card in her workbox at that very day . Mr. Bungay presently had enough of this talk and got up to take leave , whereupon Warrington and Pen rose to depart with the publisher , though the latter would have liked to stay to make a further acquaintance with this family , who interested him and touched him . He said something about hoping for permission to repeat his visit , upon which Shandon , with a rueful grin , said he was always to be found at home , and should be delighted to see Mr. Pennington . "
185248	185268	185269	185269	Charles	1479	" said Captain Shandon , seizing his hat , in spite of a deprecatory look and a faint cry of "
185270	186018	186019	186019	He	7058	" from Mrs. Shandon . And the Captain , in shabby slippers , shuffled out before his guests , leading the way through the dismal passages of the prison . His hand was already fiddling with his waistcoat pocket , where Bungay 's five - pound note was , as he took leave of the three gentlemen at the wicket ; one of them , Mr. Arthur Pendennis , being greatly relieved when he was out of the horrid place , and again freely treading the flags of Farringdon Street . Mrs. Shandon sadly went on with her work at the window looking into the court . She saw Shandon with a couple of men at his heels run rapidly in the direction of the prison tavern . She had hoped to have had him to dinner herself that day : there was a piece of meat , and some salad in a basin , on the ledge outside of the window of their room which she had expected that she and little Mary were to share with the child 's father . But there was no chance of that now . He would be in that tavern until the hours for closing it ; then he would go and play at cards or drink in some other man 's room and come back silent , with glazed eyes , reeling a little on his walk , that his wife might nurse him . Oh , what varieties of pain do we not make our women suffer ! So Mrs. Shandon went to the cupboard , and , in lieu of a dinner , made herself some tea . And in those varieties of pain of which we spoke anon , what a part of confidante has that poor tea - pot played ever since the kindly plant was introduced among us ! What myriads of women have cried over it , to be sure ! What sick - beds it has smoked by ! What fevered lips have received refreshment from out of it ! Nature meant very gently by women when she made that tea - plant ; and with a little thought what a series of pictures and groups the fancy may conjure up and assemble round the tea - pot and cup ! Melissa and Sacharissa are talking love - secrets over it . Poor Polly has it and her lover 's letters upon the table ; his letters who was her lover yesterday , and when it was with pleasure , not despair , she wept over them . Mary tripping noiselessly comes into her mother 's bedroom , bearing a cup of the consoler to the widow who will take no other food , Ruth is busy concocting it for her husband , who is coming home from the harvest - field - one could fill a page with hints for such pictures ; - finally , Mrs. Shandon and little Mary sit down and drink their tea together , while the Captain goes out and takes his pleasure . She cares for nothing else but that , when her husband is away . A gentleman with whom we are already slightly acquainted , Mr. Jack Finucane , a townsman of Captain Shandon 's , found the Captain 's wife and little Mary for whom Jack always brought a sweetmeat in his pocket over this meal . Jack thought Shandon the greatest of created geniuses , had had one or two helps from the good - natured prodigal , who had always a kind word , and sometimes a guinea for any friend in need ; and never missed a day in seeing his patron . He was ready to run Shandon 's errands and transact his money - business with publishers and newspaper editors , duns , creditors , holders of Shandon 's acceptances , gentlemen disposed to speculate in those securities , and to transact the thousand little affairs of an embarrassed Irish gentleman . I never knew an embarrassed Irish gentleman yet , but he had an aide - de - camp of his own nation , likewise in circumstances of pecuniary discomfort . That aide - de - camp has subordinates of his own , who again may have other insolvent dependents - all through his life our Captain marched at the head of a ragged staff , who shared in the rough fortunes of their chieftain . "
186036	186235	186031	186031	I	0	" Mr. Bungay said of the Captain , as he and his two companions walked away from the prison ; and the publisher judged rightly , for when Mrs. Shandon came to empty her husband 's pockets , she found but a couple of shillings , and a few halfpence out of the morning 's remittance . Shandon had given a pound to one follower ; had sent a leg of mutton and potatoes and beer to an acquaintance in the poor side of the prison ; had paid an outstanding bill at the tavern where he had changed his five - pound note ; had had a dinner with two friends there , to whom he lost sundry half - crowns at cards afterwards ; so that the night left him as poor as the morning had found him . The publisher and the two gentlemen had had some talk together after quitting Shandon , and Warrington reiterated to Bungay what he had said to his rival , Bacon , viz . , that Pen was a high fellow , of great genius , and what was more , well with the great world , and related to "
186238	186287	186019	186019	He	7058	" of the peerage . Bungay replied that he should be happy to have dealings with Mr. Pendennis , and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing both gents to cut mutton with him before long , and so , with mutual politeness and protestations , they parted . "
186299	186317	186293	186295	such a man	17228	" Pen said , musing , and talking that night over the sight which he had witnessed , "
186354	186355	186356	186356	I	0	" "
186376	186383	186384	186384	We	7066	" Warrington said with a laugh . "
186438	186439	186433	186434	your bookseller	7070	" "
186451	186454	186433	186434	your bookseller	7070	" said Pen "
186567	186568	186544	186565	a man who ca n't speak the language that he lives by , who is not fit to black Shandon 's boots	7075	" "
186597	186604	186591	186591	Pen	799	" Warrington answered , laughing still . "
186654	186655	186652	186652	Shandon	1481	" "
186664	186668	186652	186652	Shandon	1481	" Pen said . "
186735	186736	186740	186742	men of genius	7088	" "
186744	186766	186767	186767	I	0	" Warrington cried out , who was a very severe moralist upon some points , though possibly a very had practitioner . "
186930	186931	186932	186932	I	0	" "
186942	186999	186932	186932	I	0	" said Pen , smiling . I suppose I should like to belong to a well - dressed profession . I protest against that wretch of a middle - man whom I see between Genius and his great landlord , the Public , and who stops more than half of the labourer 's earnings and fame . "
187000	187007	187008	187008	Warrington	1359	" I am a prose labourer , "
187011	187392	187008	187008	Warrington	1359	" you , my boy , are a poet in a small way , and so , I suppose , consider you are authorised to be flighty . What is it you want ? Do you want a body of capitalists that shall be forced to purchase the works of all authors , who may present themselves , manuscript in hand ? Everybody who writes his epic , every driveller who can or ca n't spell , and produces his novel or his tragedy , - are they all to come and find a bag of sovereigns in exchange for their worthless reams of paper ? Who is to settle what is good or bad , saleable or otherwise ? Will you give the buyer leave , in fine , to purchase or not ? Why , sir , when Johnson sate behind the screen at Saint John 's Gate , and took his dinner apart , because he was too shabby and poor to join the literary bigwigs who were regaling themselves , round Mr. Cave 's best table - cloth , the tradesman was doing him no wrong . You could n't force the publisher to recognise the man of genius in the young man who presented himself before him , ragged , gaunt , and hungry . Rags are not a proof of genius ; whereas capital is absolute , as times go , and is perforce the bargain - master . It has a right to deal with the literary inventor as with any other ; - if I produce a novelty in the book trade , I must do the best I can with it ; but I can no more force Mr. Murray to purchase my book of travels or sermons , than I can compel Mr. Tattersall to give me a hundred guineas for my horse . I may have my own ideas of the value of my Pegasus , and think him the most wonderful of animals ; but the dealer has a right to his opinion , too , and may want a lady 's horse , or a cob for a heavy timid rider , or a sound hack for the road , and my beast wo n't suit him . "
187393	187401	187402	187402	Pen	799	" You deal in metaphors , Warrington , "
187405	187458	187402	187402	Pen	799	" but you rightly say that you are very prosaic . Poor Shandon ! There is something about the kindness of that man , and the gentleness of that sweet creature of a wife , which touches me profoundly . I like him , I am afraid , better than a better man "
187459	187465	187466	187466	Warrington	1359	" And so do I , "
187469	187548	187466	187466	Warrington	1359	" Let us give him the benefit of our sympathy , and the pity that is due to his weakness : though I fear that sort of kindness would be resented as contempt by a more high - minded man . You see he takes his consolation along with his misfortune , and one generates the other or balances ii , as the way of the world . He is a prisoner , but he is not unhappy . "
187549	187558	187559	187559	Pen	799	" His genius sings within his prison bars , "
187562	187565	187566	187566	Warrington	1359	" Yes , "
187571	187724	187566	187566	Warrington	1359	" Shandon accommodates himself to a cage pretty well . He ought to be wretched , but he has Jack and Tom to drink with , and that consoles him : he might have a high place , but , as he ca n't , why , he can drink with Tom and Jack ; - he might be providing for his wife and children , but Thomas and John have got a bottle of brandy which they want him to taste ; - he might pay poor Snip , the tailor , the twenty pounds which the poor devil wants for his landlord , but John and Thomas lay their hands upon his purse ; - and so he drinks whilst his tradesman goes to gaol and his family to ruin . Let us pity the misfortunes of genius , and conspire against the publishing tyrants who oppress men of letters . "
187725	187742	187743	187743	Pen	799	" What ! are you going to have another glass of brandy - and - water ? "
187777	187795	187796	187796	he	1359	" Video meliora proboque - I mean , bring it me hot , with sugar , John , "
187801	187817	187819	187819	Pen	799	" I would have some more , too , only I do n't want it , "
187821	187840	187819	187819	Pen	799	" It does not seem to me , Warrington , that we are much better than our neighbours . "
187919	187937	187891	187891	his	7107	" We shall have a grand spread , Warrington . We shall meet all Bungay 's corps . "
187938	187944	187946	187946	Pen	799	" All except poor Shandon , "
188517	188523	188525	188525	Warrington	1493	" Pen , you beggar ! "
188536	188539	188542	188542	Pen	799	" Hullo ! "
188544	188552	188554	188555	the other	14365	" Come here , you 're wanted , "
188562	188567	188569	188569	he	799	" What is it ? "
188571	188574	188576	188576	Warrington	1493	" Catch ! "
188599	188615	188616	188616	Warrington	1493	" It 's books for review for the Pall Mall Gazette : pitch into 'em , "
188667	188674	188676	188676	he	1493	" Sport the oak , Pidgeon , "
188678	188690	188676	188676	he	1493	" I 'm not at home to anybody to - day . "
189632	189640	189641	189641	he	1404	" when the Captain 's locked up , "
189644	189668	189641	189641	he	1404	" we are sure to find him at home ; whereas , when he 's free , you can never catch hold of him "
189766	189794	189796	189796	he	1457	" No , sir , - this is my affair , sir , if you please . James , take the bill , and eighteenpence for yourself , "
189976	190023	190024	190025	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" May I go , Charley ? or shall I stay with you , for you 're poorly , dear , this morning ? He 's got a headache , Mr. Finucane . He suffers from headaches , and I persuaded him to stay in bed , "
190028	190060	190024	190025	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" Go along with you , and Polly . Jack , take care of 'em . Hand me over the Burton 's Anatomy , and leave me to my abominable devices , "
190285	190295	190297	190298	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" I hope you 're pretty well , mum ? "
190300	190308	190310	190311	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" It 's a very fine day , "
190313	190322	190324	190325	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" Wo n't you step in , mum ? "
190339	190359	190361	190363	timid Mrs. Shandon	1481	" I - I came about business with Mr. Bungay - I - I hope he 's pretty well ? "
190365	190392	190394	190395	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" If you go to see him in the counting - house , could n't you , could n't you leave your little gurl with me ? "
190418	190426	190409	190409	she	1469	" I want to stay with mamma , "
190440	190451	190453	190454	the mother	2237	" Go with this lady , Mary , my dear , "
190456	190465	190467	190468	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" I 'll show you some pretty pictures , "
190477	190487	190467	190468	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" and some nice things besides ; look here , "
190598	190618	190579	190580	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" If you will let me , I will come up too , and sit for a few minutes , "
190787	190791	190780	190780	she	7213	" over the way "
191112	191123	191124	191124	Maecenas	1501	" What 's in the wind now , my dear ? "
191135	191160	191124	191124	Maecenas	1501	" You would n't hear of my doing anything for the Captain this morning : I wonder what has been a changing of you . "
191167	191172	191164	191165	an Irishman	19309	" Mrs. Bungay replied ; "
191242	191243	191238	191240	the little gurl	7254	" "
191255	191256	191249	191249	I	0	" "
191275	191331	191272	191273	Mr. B.	1500	" - and Mrs. Bungay 's thoughts flew back to a period eighteen years back , when Bacon and Bungay had just set up in business as small booksellers in a country town , and when she had had a child , named Bessy , something like the little Mary who had moved her compassion . "
191339	191358	191359	191360	the Captain	14344	" Mr. Bungay said , seeing the little eyes of his wife begin to twinkle and grow red ; "
191441	191556	191426	191426	I	0	" And the upshot of this conversation was , that Mr. and Mrs. Bungay both ascended to the drawing - room , and Mr. Bungay made a heavy and clumsy speech , in which he announced to Mrs. Shandon , that , hearing sixty - five pounds would set her husband free , he was ready to advance that sum of money , deducting it from the Captain 's salary , and that he would give it to her on condition that she would personally settle with the creditors regarding her husband 's liberation . I think this was the happiest day that Mrs. Shandon and Mr. Finucane had had for a long time . "
191566	191578	191563	191564	a trump	7262	" roared out Fin , in an overpowering brogue and emotion . "
191607	191627	191590	191590	we	7263	" and he jumped about the room , and tossed up little Mary , with a hundred frantic antics . "
191651	191736	191641	191641	I	0	" Mrs. Bungay said , looking out at a one - horsed vehicle which had just driven up , and in which this lady took the air considerably - and the two ladies , with little Mary between them whose tiny hand Maecenas 's wife kept fixed in her great grasp , with the delighted Mr. Finucane on the back seat , drove away from Paternoster Row , as the owner of the vehicle threw triumphant glances at the opposite windows at Bacon 's . "
191746	191758	191641	191641	I	0	" thought Bungay , going back to his desk and accounts , "
191791	192049	191786	191786	Flora	744	" and he wondered how women did remember things . We are happy to say that Mrs. Shandon sped with very good success upon her errand . She who had had to mollify creditors when she had no money at all , and only tears and entreaties wherewith to soothe them , found no difficulty in making them relent by means of a bribe of ten shillings in the pound ; and the next Sunday was the last , for some time at least , which the Captain spent in prison . CHAPTER XXXV Dinner in the Row Upon the appointed day our two friends made their appearance at Mr. Bungay 's door in Paternoster Row ; not the public entrance through which booksellers ' boys issued with their sacks full of Bungay 's volumes , and around which timid aspirants lingered with their virgin manuscripts ready for sale to Sultan Bungay , but at the private door of the house , whence the splendid Mrs. Bungay would come forth to step into her chaise and take her drive , settling herself on the cushions , and casting looks of defiance at Mrs. Bacon 's opposite windows - at Mrs. Bacon , who was as yet a chaiseless woman . On such occasions , when very much wroth at her sister - in - law 's splendour Mrs. Bacon would fling up the sash of her drawing - room window , and look out with her four children at the chaise , as much as to say , "
192085	192182	192183	192183	You	7273	" And it was with these arrows out of her quiver that Emma Bacon shot Flora Bungay as she sate in her chariot envious and childless . As Pen and Warrington came to Bungay 's door , a carriage and a cab drove up to Bacon 's . Old Dr. Slocum descended heavily from the first ; the Doctor 's equipage was as ponderous as his style , but both had a fine sonorous effect upon the publishers in the Row . A couple of dazzling white waistcoats stepped out of the cab . Warrington laughed . "
192236	192667	192233	192233	he	1344	" Indeed , Messrs. Hoolan and Doolan had come from the Strand in the same cab , tossing up by the way which should pay the shilling ; and Mr. D. stepped from the other side of the way , arrayed in black , with a large pair of white gloves which were spread out on his hands , and which the owner could not help regarding with pleasure . The house porter in an evening coat , and gentlemen with gloves as large as Doolan 's , but of the famous Berlin web , were on the passage of Mr. Bungay 's house to receive the guests ' hats and coats , and bawl their names up the stair . Some of the latter had arrived when the three new visitors made their appearance ; but there was only Mrs. Bungay in red satin and a turban to represent her own charming sex . She made curtsies to each new - comer as he entered the drawing - room , but her mind was evidently pre - occupied by extraneous thoughts . The fact is , Mrs. Bacon 's dinner - party was disturbing her , and as soon as she had received each individual of her own company , Flora Bungay flew back to the embrasure of the window , whence she could rake the carriages of Emma Bacon 's friends as they came rattling up the Row . The sight of Dr. Slocum 's large carriage , with the gaunt job - horses , crushed Flora : none but hack cabs had driven up to her own door on that day . They were all literary gentlemen , though unknown as yet to Pen . There was Mr. Bole , the real editor of the magazine , of which Mr. Wagg was the nominal chief ; Mr. Trotter , who , from having broken out on the world as a poet of a tragic and suicidial cast , had now subsided into one of Mr. Bungay 's back shops as reader for that gentleman ; and Captain Sumph , an ex - beau reader about town , and related in some indistinct manner to Literature and the Peerage . He was said to have written a book once , to have been a friend of Lord Byron , to be related to Lord Sumphington ; in fact , anecdotes of Byron formed his staple , and he seldom spoke but with the name of that poet or some of his contemporaries in his mouth , as thus : "
192696	192699	192700	192700	I	0	" or , "
192716	192822	192704	192704	I	0	" and so forth . This gentleman , Pen remarked , was listened to with great attention by Mrs. Bungay ; his anecdotes of the aristocracy , of which he was a middle - aged member , delighted the publisher 's lady ; and he was almost a greater man than the great Mr. Wagg himself in her eyes . Had he but come in his own carriage , Mrs. Bungay would have made her Bungay purchase any given volume from his pen . Mr. Bungay went about to his guests as they arrived , and did the honours of his house with much cordiality . "
192901	192902	192891	192891	you	7280	" "
192907	192912	192905	192905	Bungay	1469	" said Mrs. Bungay . "
192936	192974	192975	192975	She	1469	" Doolan said , and he winked and stroked his lean chops with his large gloves ; and made appeals of friendship to Mrs. Bungay , which that honest woman refused with scorn from the timid man . "
192982	193083	192975	192975	She	1469	" she said in confidence to her friends . Indeed , all his flatteries failed to win her . As they talked , Mrs. Bungay surveying mankind from her window , a magnificent vision of an enormous grey cab - horse appeared , and neared rapidly . A pair of white reins , held by small white gloves , were visible behind it ; a face pale , but richly decorated with a chin - tuft , the head of an exiguous groom bobbing over the cab - head - these bright things were revealed to the delighted Mrs. Bungay . "
193095	193114	193092	193092	I	0	" she said , and sailed to the door to be in waiting at the nobleman 's arrival . "
193120	193183	193117	193118	Percy Popjoy	1453	" said Pen , looking out of window , and seeing an individual , in extremely lacquered boots , descend from the swinging cab : and , in fact , it was that young nobleman Lord Falconet 's eldest son , as we all very well know , who was come to dine with the publisher - his publisher of the Row . "
193191	193195	193196	193196	I	0	" Warrington said . "
193206	193298	193196	193196	I	0	" He and Pen had had some bouts at the Oxbridge Union debates , in which Pen had had very much the better of Percy : who presently appeared , with his hat under his arm , and a look of indescribable good - humour and fatuity in his round dimpled face : upon which Nature had burst out with a chin - tuft , but , exhausted with the effort , had left the rest of the countenance bare of hair . The temporary groom of the chambers bawled out , "
193304	193317	193299	193302	The Honourable Percy Popjoy	1453	" much to that gentleman 's discomposure at hearing his titles announced . "
193332	193339	193320	193321	the man	14896	" he asked of the publisher . "
193394	193395	193391	193391	I	0	" "
193405	193410	193411	193411	Quiz	1515	" said Mrs. Bungay . "
193459	193498	193448	193448	I	0	" he asked of the two young men , turnip his lacquered heels upon Mrs. Bungay , who respected her husband 's two young guests , now that she found they were intimate with a lord 's son . "
193506	193513	193502	193502	they	7294	" she asked rapidly of Mr. B. "
193530	194053	193517	193517	I	0	" said the publisher ; and both ran forward , smiling and bowing , to greet almost as great personages as the young lord - no less characters , indeed , than the great Mr. Wenham and the great Mr. Wagg , who were now announced . Mr. Wenham entered , wearing the usual demure look and stealthy smile with which he commonly surveyed the tips of his neat little shining boots , and which he but seldom brought to bear upon the person who addressed him . Wagg 's white waistcoat spread out , on the contrary , with profuse brilliancy ; his burly , red face shone resplendent over it , lighted up with the thoughts of good jokes and a good dinner . He liked to make his entree into a drawing - room with a laugh , and , when he went away at night , to leave a joke exploding behind him . No personal calamities or distresses of which that humourist had his share in common with the unjocular part of mankind could altogether keep his humour down . Whatever his griefs might be , the thought of a dinner rallied his great soul ; and when he saw a lord , he saluted him with a pun . Wenham went up , then , with a smug smile and whisper , to Mrs. Bungay , and looked at her from under his eyes , and showed her the tips of his shoes . Wagg said she looked charming , and pushed on straight at the young nobleman , whom he called Pop , and to whom he instantly related a funny story , seasoned with what the French call gros sel . He was delighted to see Pen , too , and shook hands with him , and slapped him on the back cordially ; for he was full of spirits and good - humour . And he talked in a loud voice about their last place and occasion of meeting at Baymouth ; and asked how their friends of Clavering Park were , and whether Sir Francis was not coming to London for the season ; and whether Pen had been to see Lady Rockminster , who had arrived - fine old lady , Lady Rockminster ! These remarks Wagg made not for Pen 's ear so much as for the edification of the company , whom he was glad to inform that he paid visits to gentlemen 's country seats , and was on intimate terms with the nobility . Wenham also shook hands with our young friend - all of which scenes Mrs. Bungay remarked with respectful pleasure , and communicated her ideas to Bungay , afterwards , regarding the importance of Mr. Pendennis - ideas by which Pen profited much more than he was aware . Pen , who had read , and rather admired some of her works and expected to find in Miss Bunion a person somewhat resembling her own description of herself in the ' Passion - Flower , ' in which she stated that her youth resembled - "
194084	194290	194332	194332	You	7302	" and that her maturer beauty was something very different , certainly , to the artless loveliness of her prime , but still exceedingly captivating and striking , beheld , rather to his surprise and amusement , a large and bony woman in a crumpled satin dress , who came creaking into the room with a step as heavy as a grenadier 's . Wagg instantly noted the straw which she brought in at the rumpled skirt of her dress , and would have stooped to pick it up : but Miss Bunion disarmed all criticism by observing this ornament herself , and , putting her own large foot upon it , so as to separate it from her robe , she stooped and picked up the straw , saying to Mrs. Bungay , that she was very sorry to be a little late , but that the omnibus was very slow , and what a comfort it was to get a ride all the way from Brompton for sixpence . Nobody laughed at the poetess 's speech , it was uttered so simply . Indeed , the worthy woman had not the least notion of being ashamed of an action incidental upon her poverty . "
194299	194311	194332	194332	You	7302	" Pen said to Wenham , by whom he was standing . "
194330	194331	194322	194328	a very well - looking young woman	7301	" "
194347	194351	194332	194332	You	7302	" Wenham said ; "
194363	194364	194352	194353	Miss Bunion	1518	" "
194378	194379	194367	194367	I	0	" "
194384	194403	194382	194382	I	0	" said Mr. Wenham , who would have starved rather than have come to dinner in an omnibus , "
194505	194594	194490	194490	she	7307	" This history , told in a bland smiling manner , of a Duchess whom Wenham had met that very morning , too , quite put poor Wagg 's dowager and baronet out of court , and placed Wenham beyond Wagg as a man of fashion . Wenham kept this inestimable advantage , and having the conversation to himself , ran on with a number of anecdotes regarding the aristocracy . He tried to bring Mr. Popjoy into the conversation by making appeals to him , and saying , "
194603	194606	194595	194595	I	0	" or , "
194628	194924	194619	194620	the Duke	17525	" but Mr. Popjoy would not gratify him by joining in the talk , preferring to fall back into the window recess with Mrs. Bungay , and watch the cabs that drove up to the opposite door . At least , if he would not talk , the hostess hoped that those odious Bacons would see how she had secured the noble Percy Popjoy for her party . And now the bell of Saint Paul 's tolled half an hour later than that for which Mr. Bungay had invited his party , and it was complete with the exception of two guests , who at last made their appearance , and in whom Pen was pleased to recognise Captain and Mrs. Shandon . When these two had made their greetings to the master and mistress of the house , and exchanged nods of more or less recognition with most of the people present , Pen and Warrington went up , and shook hands very warmly with Mrs. Shandon , who , perhaps , was affected to meet them , and think where it was she had seen them but a few days before . Shandon was brushed up , and looked pretty smart , in a red velvet waistcoat , and a frill , into which his wife had stuck her best brooch . In spite of Mrs. Bungay 's kindness , perhaps in consequence of it , Mrs. Shandon felt great terror and timidity in approaching her : indeed , she was more awful than ever in her red satin and bird of paradise , and it was not until she had asked in her great voice about the dear little gurl , that the latter was somewhat encouraged , and ventured to speak . "
194930	194936	194619	194620	the Duke	17525	" Popjoy whispered to Warrington . "
194969	195009	194966	194966	I	0	" This was the truth : Heaven had not endowed young Mr. Popjoy with much intellect of his own , but had given him a generous faculty for admiring , if not for appreciating , the intellect of others . "
195060	195269	195270	195270	I	0	" So Mr. Popjoy and Mr. Shandon had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with one another ; and now the doors of the adjoining dining - room being flung open , the party entered and took their seats at table . Pen found himself next to Bunion on one side , and to Mr. Wagg - the truth is , Wagg fled alarmed from the vacant place by the poetess , and Pen was compelled to take it . The gifted being did not talk much during dinner , but Pen remarked that she ate with a vast appetite , and never refused any of the supplies of wine which were offered to her by the butler . Indeed , Miss Bunion having considered Mr. Pendennis for a minute , who gave himself rather grand airs , and who was attired in an extremely fashionable style , with his very best chains , shirt studs , and cambric fronts , he was set down , and not without reason , as a prig by the poetess ; who thought it was much better to attend to her dinner than to take any notice of him . She told him as much in after days with her usual candour . "
195281	195287	195270	195270	I	0	" she said to Pen . "
195331	195332	195317	195317	I	0	" "
195345	195352	195342	195343	Miss Bunion	1518	" Pen said with a laugh . "
195391	195392	195374	195374	you	7315	" "
195410	195444	195399	195399	I	0	" Pen said with an air of comical gallantry : - But we must return to the day , and the dinner at Paternoster Row . The repast was of the richest description - "
195454	195508	195446	195446	I	0	" Wagg whispered to Penn , who sate beside the humourist , in his side - wing voice . The men in creaking shoes and Berlin gloves were numerous and solemn , carrying on rapid conversations behind the guests , as they moved to and fro with the dishes . Doolan called out , "
195511	195541	195446	195446	I	0	" to one of them , and blushed when he thought of his blunder . Mrs. Bungay 's footboy was lost amidst those large and black - coated attendants . "
195551	195555	195544	195549	that very bow - windowed man	7320	" Wagg said . "
195637	195638	195623	195623	Bungay	1469	" "
195653	195658	195646	195647	Mr. Wagg	1033	" said the publisher . "
195697	195698	195699	195701	The old rogue	15582	" "
195719	195723	195699	195701	The old rogue	15582	" Wagg said . "
195828	195829	195811	195812	the butler	14010	" "
195835	195843	195811	195812	the butler	14010	" said Popjoy , good - naturedly . "
195854	195855	195811	195812	the butler	14010	" "
195859	195875	195811	195812	the butler	14010	" Mrs. Bungay said , thinking he spoke of a jack - chain very likely . "
195882	195888	195876	195876	I	0	" said the polite guest . "
195895	195901	195876	195876	I	0	" again said the lady . "
195914	195919	195911	195912	Mrs. B.	842	" called out Wagg . "
195930	195937	195925	195925	I	0	" answered the publisher 's lady . "
195950	195968	195944	195944	he	7341	" cried Mr. Wagg ; but nobody saw the pun , which disconcerted somewhat the bashful punster . "
195986	195991	195983	195983	Bacon	1506	" he whispered Pen . "
196054	196070	196051	196052	Mrs. B.	842	" he said , helping himself to a dish which the undertaker handed to him . "
196080	196413	196073	196073	I	0	" Mrs. Bungay answered , blushing and not knowing whether the name of the dish was actually that which Wagg gave to it , but dimly conscious that that individual was quizzing her . Accordingly she hated Mr. Wagg with female ardour ; and would have deposed him from his command over Mr. Bungay 's periodical , but that his name was great in the trade , and his reputation in the land considerable . By the displacement of persons , Warrington had found himself on the right hand of Mrs. Shandon , who sate in plain black silk and faded ornaments by the side of the florid publisher . The sad smile of the lady moved his rough heart to pity . Nobody seemed to interest himself about her : she sate looking at her husband , who himself seemed rather abashed in the presence of some of the company . Wenham and Wagg both knew him and his circumstances . He had worked with the latter , and was immeasurably his superior in wit , genius , and acquirement ; but Wagg 's star was brilliant in the world , and poor Shandon was unknown there . He could not speak before the noisy talk of the coarser and more successful man ; but drank his wine in silence , and as much of it as the people would give him . He was under surveillance . Bungay had warned the undertaker not to fill the Captain 's glass too often or too full . It was a melancholy precaution that , and the more melancholy that it was necessary . Mrs. Shandon , too , cast alarmed glances across the table to see that her husband did not exceed . Abashed by the failure of his first pun , for he was impudent and easily disconcerted , Wagg kept his conversation pretty much to Pen during the rest of dinner , and of course chiefly spoke about their neighbours . "
196425	196429	196430	196430	We	7346	" he said . "
196588	196589	196566	196569	the Cardinal in disguise	7349	" "
196595	196599	196591	196591	you	7353	" Popjoy answered ; "
196609	196610	196591	196591	you	7353	" "
196621	196627	196591	196591	you	7353	" whispered Wagg to Pen . "
196648	196649	196650	196650	I	0	" "
196669	196674	196664	196665	Cardinal Mezzocaldo	1531	" Captain Sumph began , "
196743	196744	196738	196738	he	764	" "
196754	196758	196750	196750	Sumph	1511	" Wagg said . "
196785	196789	196781	196781	Bungay	1469	" Shandon said . "
196815	196820	196793	196793	you	1511	" bawled out Wagg . "
196838	196842	196824	196824	you	1511	" Shandon replied . "
196852	196871	196872	196872	Bungay	1469	" asked Wenham , who knew perfectly well , but was ashamed of his connection with the press . "
196880	196899	196872	196872	Bungay	1469	" cried Popjoy , who , on the contrary , was proud of his literary reputation and acquaintances . "
196967	196968	196961	196962	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" "
196979	196983	196961	196962	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" growled Wagg , "
196996	196997	196985	196986	little Popjoy	1466	" "
197022	197026	197011	197011	we	7364	" Shandon said . "
197036	197040	197011	197011	we	7364	" asked Wagg . "
197085	197095	197083	197083	Wagg	1033	" Shandon said ; he was getting rather angry . "
197138	197139	197170	197171	Mr. Wagg	1033	" "
197150	197154	197155	197155	I	0	" said Wagg . "
197173	197177	197170	197171	Mr. Wagg	1033	" said Shandon . "
197192	197193	197188	197188	you	2261	" "
197201	197493	197195	197195	I	0	" said Wagg ; but this was spoken in an undertone , and the good - natured Irishman was appeased almost in an instant after his ebullition of spleen , and asked Wagg to drink wine with him in a friendly voice . When the ladies retired from the table , the talk grew louder still ; and presently Wenham , in a courtly speech , proposed that everybody should drink to the health of the new Journal , eulogising highly the talents , wit , and learning of its editor , Captain Shandon . It was his maxim never to lose the support of a newspaper man , and in the course of that evening he went round and saluted every literary gentleman present with a privy compliment specially addressed to him ; informing this one how great an impression had been made in Downing Street by his last article , and telling that one how profoundly his good friend , the Duke of So - and - So , had been struck by the ability of the late numbers . The evening came to a close , and in spite of all the precautions to the contrary , poor Shandon reeled in his walk , and went home to his new lodgings , with his faithful wife by his side , and the cabman on his box jeering at him . Wenham had a chariot of his own , which he put at Popjoy 's seat ; and the timid Miss Bunion seeing Mr. Wagg , who was her neighbour , about to depart , insisted upon a seat in his carriage , much to that gentleman 's discomfiture . Pen and Warrington walked home together in the moonlight . "
197497	197501	197195	197195	I	0	" Warrington said , "
197552	197942	197512	197512	me	0	" Pen was forced to confess that the literary personages with whom he had become acquainted had not said much , in the course of the night 's conversation , that was worthy to be remembered or quoted . In fact not one word about literature had been said during the whole course of the night : - and it may be whispered to those uninitiated people who are anxious to know the habits and make the acquaintance of men of letters , that there are no race of people who talk about books , or , perhaps , who read books , so little as literary men . CHAPTER XXXVI The Pall Mall Gazette Considerable success at first attended the new journal . It was generally stated , that an influential political party supported the paper ; and great names were cited amongst the contributors to its columns . Was there any foundation for these rumours ? We are not at liberty to say whether they were ill - founded ; but this much we may divulge , that an article upon foreign policy , which was generally attributed to a noble Lord , whose connexion with the Foreign Office is very well known , was in reality composed by Captain Shandon , in the parlour of the Bear and Staff public - house near Whitehall Stairs , whither the printer 's boy had tracked him , and where a literary ally of his , Mr. Bludyer , had a temporary residence ; and that a series of papers on finance questions , which were universally supposed to be written by a great Statesman of the House of Commons , were in reality composed by Mr. George Warrington of the Upper Temple . That there may have been some dealings between the Pall Mall Gazette and this influential party , is very possible , Percy Popjoy whose father , Lord Falconet , was a member of the party might be seen not unfrequently ascending the stairs to Warrington 's chambers ; and some information appeared in the paper which it gave a character , and could only be got from very peculiar sources . Several poems , feeble in thought , but loud and vigorous in expression , appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette , with the signature of "
197945	198886	197512	197512	me	0	" ; and it must be owned that his novel was praised in the new journal in a very outrageous manner . In the political department of the paper Mr. Pen did not take any share ; but he was a most active literary contributor . The Pall Mall Gazette had its offices , as we have heard , in Catherine Street , in the Strand , and hither Pen often came with his manuscripts in his pocket , and with a great deal of bustle and pleasure ; such as a man feels at the outset of his literary career , when to see himself in print is still a novel sensation , and he yet pleases himself to think that his writings are creating some noise in the world . Here it was that Mr. Jack Finucane , the sub - editor , compiled with paste and scissors the Journal of which he was supervisor . With an eagle eye he scanned all the paragraphs of all the newspapers which had anything to do with the world of fashion over which he presided . He did n't let a death or a dinner - party of the aristocracy pass without having the event recorded in the columns of his Journal ; and from the most recondite provincial prints , and distant Scotch and Irish newspapers , he fished out astonishing paragraphs and intelligence regarding the upper classes of society . It was a grand , nay , a touching sight , for a philosopher , to see Jack Finucane , Esquire , with a plate of meat from the cookshop and glass of porter from the public - house , for his meal , recounting the feasts of the great as if h had been present at them ; and in tattered trousers and dingy shirt - sleeves , cheerfully describing and arranging the most brilliant fetes of the world of fashion . The incongruity of Finucane 's avocation , and his manners and appearance amused his new friend Pen . Since he left his own native village , where his rank probably was not very , lofty Jack had seldom seen any society but such as used the parlour of the taverns which he frequented , whereas from his writing you would have supposed that he dined with ambassadors , and that his common lounge was the bow - window of White 's . Errors of description , it is true , occasionally slipped from his pen ; but the Ballinafad Sentinel , of which he was own correspondent , suffered by these , not the Pall Mall Gazette , in which Jack was not permitted to write much , his London chiefs thinking that the scissors and the paste were better wielded by him than the pen . Pen took a great deal of pains with the writing of his reviews , and having a pretty fair share of desultory reading , acquired in the early years of his life an eager fancy and a keen sense of fun , his articles pleased his chief and the public , and he was proud to think that he deserved the money which he earned . We may be sure that the Pall Mall Gazette was taken in regularly at Fairoaks , and read with delight by the two ladies there . It was received at Clavering Park , too , where we know there was a young lady of great literary tastes ; and old Doctor Portman himself , to whom the widow sent her paper after she had got her son 's articles by heart , signified his approval of Pen 's productions , saying that the lad had spirit , taste , and fancy , and wrote , if not like a scholar , at any rate like a gentleman . And what was the astonishment and delight of our friend Major Pendennis , on walking into one of his clubs , the Regent , where Wenham , Lord Falconet , and some other gentlemen of good reputation and fashion were assembled , to hear them one day talking over a number of the Pall Mall Gazette , and of an article which appeared in its columns , making some bitter fun of the book recently published by the wife of a celebrated member of the opposition party . The book in question was a Book of Travels in Spain and Italy , by the Countess of Muffborough , in which it was difficult to say which was the most wonderful , the French or the English , in which languages her ladyship wrote indifferently , and upon the blunders of which the critic pounced with delightful mischief . The critic was no other than Pen : he jumped and danced round about his subject with the greatest jocularity and high spirits : he showed up the noble lady 's faults with admirable mock gravity and decorum . There was not a word in the article which was not polite and gentlemanlike ; and the unfortunate subject of the criticism was scarified and laughed at during the operation . Wenham 's bilious countenance was puckered up with malign pleasure as he read the critique . Lady Muffborough had not asked him to her parties during the last year . Lord Falconet giggled and laughed with all his heart ; Lord Muffborough and he had been rivals ever since they began life ; and these complimented Major Pendennis , who until now had scarcely paid any attention to some hints which his Fairoaks correspondence threw out of "
198907	199023	198888	198888	Arthur	739	" and had thought any notice of Mr. Pen and his newspaper connexions quite below his dignity as a Major and a gentleman . But when the oracular Wenham praised the boy 's production ; when Lord Falconet , who had had the news from Percy Popjoy , approved of the genius of young Pen ; when the great Lord Steyne himself , to whom the Major referred the article , laughed and sniggered over it , swore it was capital , and that the Muffborough would writhe under it , like a whale under a harpoon , the Major , as in duty bound , began to admire his nephew very much , said , "
199050	199562	199041	199041	he	2238	" and with a hand quite tremulous with pleasure , the old gentleman sate down to write to the widow at Fairoaks all that the great folks had said in praise of Pen ; and he wrote to the young rascal , too , asking when he would come and eat a chop with his old uncle , and saying that he was commissioned to take him to dinner at Gaunt House , for Lord Steyne liked anybody who could entertain him , whether by his folly , wit , or by his dulness , by his oddity , affectation , good spirits , or any other quality . Pen flung his letter across the table to Warrington : perhaps he was disappointed that the other did not seem to be much affected by it . The courage of young critics is prodigious : they clamber up to the judgment - seat , and , with scarce a hesitation , give their opinion upon works the most intricate or profound . Had Macaulay 's History or Herschel 's Astronomy been put before Pen at this period , he would have looked through the volumes , meditated his opinion over a cigar , and signified his august approval of either author , as if the critic had been their born superior and indulgent master and patron . By the help of the Biographie Universelle or the British Museum , he would be able to take a rapid resume of a historical period , and allude to names , dates , and facts , in such a masterly , easy way , as to astonish his mamma at home , who wondered where her boy could have acquired such a prodigious store of reading and himself , too , when he came to read over his articles two or three months after they had been composed , and when he had forgotten the subject and the books which he had consulted . At that period of his life , Mr. Pen owns that he would not have hesitated , at twenty - four hours ' notice , to pass his opinion upon the greatest scholars , or to give a judgment upon the Encyclopaedia . Luckily he had Warrington to laugh at him and to keep down his impertinence by a constant and wholesome ridicule , or he might have become conceited beyond all sufferance ; for Shandon liked the dash and flippancy of his young aide - de - camp , and was , indeed , better pleased with Pen 's light and brilliant flashes , than with the heavier metal which his elder coadjutor brought to bear . But though he might justly be blamed on the score of impertinence and a certain prematurity of judgment , Mr. Pen was a perfectly honest critic ; a great deal too candid for Mr. Bungay 's purposes , indeed , who grumbled sadly at his impartiality . Pen and his chief , the Captain , had a dispute upon this subject one day . "
199574	199578	199041	199041	he	2238	" Shandon asked , "
199621	199630	199593	199593	Bungay	1457	" Pen 's eyes opened with wide astonishment . "
199637	199641	199632	199632	you	7378	" he asked , "
199670	199671	199672	199672	My	0	" "
199695	199699	199680	199680	you	739	" Shandon inquired . "
199712	199716	199672	199672	My	0	" Pen said , "
199725	199726	199672	199672	My	0	" "
199731	199742	199672	199672	My	0	" said Shandon , with a laugh and a sner ; "
199756	199757	199744	199744	you	739	" "
199767	199770	199744	199744	you	739	" Pen said "
199809	199814	199804	199804	We	7384	" Pen said , laughing "
199892	199893	199889	199890	the showman	7387	" "
199900	199904	199889	199890	the showman	7387	" said Shandon . "
199921	199922	199907	199907	I	0	" "
199927	199942	199907	199907	I	0	" said Pen , with a fine sense of the dignity of his position , "
200048	200072	200023	200023	one	14276	" this redoubted instrument had now been in use for some six weeks , and Pen spoke of it with vast enthusiasm and respect "
200097	200098	200101	200102	Mr. Pendennis	739	" "
200120	200137	200110	200110	we	7384	" Shandon said , with fatal good - nature ; and very likely thought within himself , "
200152	200186	200187	200187	Gad	945	" The veteran Condottiere himself was no longer so scrupulous . He had fought and killed on so many a side for many a year past , that remorse had long left him . "
200189	200193	200187	200187	Gad	945	" said he , "
200264	200265	200262	200262	Wagg	1033	" "
200286	200287	200279	200279	Captain	3508	" "
200297	200306	200279	200279	Captain	3508	" said the Captain , biting his nails . "
200357	200388	200350	200350	God	1867	" And Pen went away from his chief , after their little dispute and colloquy , pointing his own moral to the Captain 's tale , and thinking to himself , "
200476	202582	202608	202608	Warrington	1359	" A punishment , or , at least , a trial , was in store for Mr. Pen . In the very next number of the Pall Mall Gazette , Warrington read out , with roars of laughter , an article which by no means amused Arthur Pendennis , who was himself at work with a criticism for the next week 's number of the same journal ; and in which the Spring Annual was ferociously maltreated by some unknown writer . The person of all most cruelly mauled was Pen himself . His verses had not appeared with his own name in the Spring Annual , but under an assumed signature . As he had refused to review the book , Shandon had handed it over to Mr. Bludyer , with directions to that author to dispose of it . And he had done so effectually . Mr. Bludyer , who was a man of very considerable talent , and of a race which , I believe , is quite extinct in the press of our time , had a certain notoriety in his profession , and reputation for savage humour . He smashed and trampled down the poor spring flowers with no more mercy than a bull would have on a parterre ; and having cut up the volume to his heart 's content , went and sold it at a bookstall , and purchased a pint of brandy with the proceeds of the volume . CHAPTER XXXVII Where Pen appears in Town and Country Let us be allowed to pass over a few months of the history of Mr. Arthur Pendennis 's lifetime , during the which , many events may have occurred which were more interesting and exciting to himself , than they would be likely to prove to the reader of his present memoirs . We left him , in his last chapter , regularly entered upon his business as a professional writer , or literary hack , as Mr. Warrington chooses to style himself and his friend ; and we know how the life of any hack , legal or literary , in a curacy , or in a marching regiment , or at a merchant 's desk , is dull of routine , and tedious of description . One day 's labour resembles another much too closely . A literary man has often to work for his bread against time , or against his will , or in spite of his health , or of his indolence , or of his repugnance to the subject on which he is called to exert himself , just like any other daily toiler . When you want to make money by Pegasus as he must , perhaps , who has no other saleable property , farewell poetry and aerial flights : Pegasus only rises now like Mr. Green 's balloon , at periods advertised beforehand , and when the spectator 's money has been paid . Pegasus trots in harness , over the stony pavement , and pulls a cart or a cab behind him . Often Pegasus does his work with panting sides and trembling knees , and not seldom gets a cut of the whip from his driver . Do not let us , however , be too prodigal of our pity upon Pegasus . There is no reason why this animal should be exempt from labour , or illness , or decay , any more than any of the other creatures of God 's world . If he gets the whip , Pegasus often deserves it , and I for one am quite ready to protest my friend , George Warrington , against the doctrine which poetical sympathisers are inclined to put forward , viz . , that of letters , and what is called genius , are to be exempt from prose duties of this daily , bread - wanting , tax - paying life , and not to be made to work and pay like their neighbours . Well , then , the Pall Mall Gazette being duly established and Arthur Pendennis 's merits recognised as a flippant , witty , and amusing critic , he worked away hard every week , preparing reviews of such works as came into his department , and writing his reviews with flippancy certainly , but with honesty , and to the best of his power . It might be that a historian of threescore , who had spent a quarter of a century in composing a work of which our young gentleman disposed in the course of a couple of days ' reading at the British Museum , was not altogether fairly treated by such a facile critic ; or that a poet who had been elaborating sublime sonnets and odes until he thought them fit for the public and for fame , was annoyed by two or three dozen pert lines in Mr. Pen 's review , in which the poet 's claims were settled by the critic , as if the latter were my lord on the bench and the author a miserable little suitor trembling before him . The actors at the theatres complained of him wofully , too , and very likely he was too hard upon them . But there was not much harm done after all . It is different now , as we know ; but there were so few great historians , or great poets , or great actors , in Pen 's time , that scarce any at all came up for judgment his critical desk . Those who got a little whipping , got what in the main was good for them ; not that the judge was any better or wiser than the persons whom he sentenced , or indeed ever fancied himself so . Pen had a strong sense of humour and justice , and had not therefore an overweening respect for his own works ; besides , he had his friend Warrington at his elbow - a terrible critic if the young man was disposed to be conceited , and more savage over Pen than ever he was to those whom he tried at his literary assize . By these critical labours , and by occasional contributions to leading articles of the journal , when , without wounding his paper , this eminent publicist could conscientiously speak his mind , Mr. Arthur Pendennis gained the sum of four pounds four shillings weekly , and with no small pains and labour . Likewise be furnished Magazines and Reviews with articles of his composition , and is believed to have been though on this score he never chooses to speak London correspondent of the Chatteris Champion , which at that time contained some very brilliant and eloquent letters from the metropolis . By these labours the fortunate youth was enabled to earn a sum very nearly equal to four hundred pounds a year ; and on the second Christmas after his arrival in London , he actually brought a hundred pounds to his mother , as a dividend upon the debt which he owed to Laura . That Mrs. Pendennis read every word of her son 's works , and considered him to be the profoundest thinker and most elegant writer of the day ; that she thought his retribution of the hundred pounds an act of angelic virtue ; that she feared he was ruining his health by his labours , and was delighted when he told her of the society which he met , and of the great men of letters and fashion whom he saw , will be imagined by all readers who have seen son - worship amongst mothers , and that charming simplicity of love with which women in the country watch the career of their darlings in London . If John has held such and such a brief ; if Tom has been invited to such and such a ball ; or George has met this or that great and famous man at dinner ; what a delight there is in the hearts of mothers and sisters at home in Somersetshire ! How young Hopeful 's letters are read and remembered ! What a theme for village talk they give , and friendly congratulation ! In the second winter , Pen came for a very brief space , and cheered the widow 's heart , and lightened up the lonely house at Fairoaks . Helen had her son all to herself ; Laura was away on a visit to old Lady Rockminster ; the folks of Clavering Park were absent ; the very few old friends of the house , Doctor Portman at their head , called upon Mr. Pen , and treated him with marked respect ; between mother and son , it was all fondness , confidence , and affection . It was the happiest fortnight of the widow 's whole life ; perhaps in the lives of both of them . The holiday was gone only too quickly ; and Pen was back in the busy world , and the gentle widow alone again . She sent Arthur 's money to Laura : I do n't know why this young lady took the opportunity of leaving home when Pen was coming thither , or whether he was the more piqued or relieved by her absence . He was by this time , by his own merits and his uncle 's introductions , pretty well introduced into London , and known both in literary and polite circles . Amongst the former his fashionable reputation stood him in no little stead ; he was considered to be a gentleman of good present means and better expectations , who wrote for his pleasure , than which there can not be a greater recommendation to a young literary aspirant . Bacon , Bungay and Co. were proud to accept his articles ; Mr. Wenham asked him to dinner ; Mr. Wagg looked upon him with a favourable eye ; and they reported how they met him at the houses of persons of fashion , amongst whom he was pretty welcome , as they did not trouble themselves about his means , present or future ; as his appearance and address were good ; and as he had got a character for being a clever fellow . Finally , he was asked to one house , because he was seen at another house : and thus no small varieties of London life were presented to the young man : he was made familiar with all sorts of people from Paternoster Row to Pimlico , and was as much at home at Mayfair dining - tables as at those tavern boards where some of his companions of the pen were accustomed to assemble . Full of high spirits and curiosity , easily adapting himself to all whom he met , the young fellow pleased himself in this strange variety and jumble of men , and made himself welcome , or at ease at least , wherever he went . He would breakfast , for instance , at Mr. Plover 's of a morning , in company with a Peer , a Bishop , a parliamentary orator , two blue ladies of fashion , a popular preacher , the author of the last new novel , and the very latest lion imported from Egypt or from America : and would quit this distinguished society for the back room at the newspaper office , where pens and ink and the wet proof - sheets were awaiting him . Here would be Finucane , the sub - editor , with the last news from the Row : and Shandon would come in presently , and giving a nod to Pen , would begin scribbling his leading article at the other end of the table , flanked by the pint of sherry , which , when the attendant boy beheld him , was always silently brought for the Captain : or Mr. Bludyer 's roaring voice would be heard in the front room , where that truculent critic would impound the books on the counter in spite of the timid remonstrances of Mr. Midge , the publisher , and after looking through the volumes would sell them at his accustomed bookstall , and having drunken and dined upon the produce of the sale in a tavern box , would call for ink and paper , and proceed to ' smash "

It was Towler , sir , took 'em in two cabs to Dobree 's - and a good deal of the plate went the same way . Do n't you remember seeing of it at Blackwall , with the Levant arms and coronick , and Lord Levant settn oppsit to it at the Marquis of Steyne 's dinner ? Beg your pardon ; did I cut you , sir ? "
204660	204707	204650	204650	he	820	" They 've took a house in Grosvenor Place , and are coming out strong , sir . Her Ladyship 's going to give three parties , besides a dinner a week , sir . Her fortune wo n't stand it - ca n't stand it . "

204782	204794	204795	204795	Morgan	820	" There 's been a tremenjuous row about that Mosseer Marobblan , "

Those French fellers , they fancy everybody is in love with 'em ; and he climbed up the large grape vine to her winder , sir , and was a trying to get in , when he was caught , sir ; and Mr. Strong came out , and they got the garden - engine and played on him , and there was no end of a row , sir .

205054	205193	205048	205048	Morgan	820	" Know nothing about it , sir . Servants do n't know them kind of things the least . Most probbly there was nothing in it - so many lies is told about families - Marobblan went away , bag and baggage , saucepans , and pianna , and all - the feller ad a pianna , and wrote potry in French , and he took a lodging at Clavering , and he hankered about the primises , and it was said that Madam Fribsy , the milliner , brought letters to Miss Hamory , though I do n't believe a word about it ; nor that he tried to pison hisself with charcoal , which it was all a humbug betwigst him and Madam Fribsy ; and he was nearly shot by the keeper in the park .

205470	205474	205467	205468	the Major	2155	" said Pen . "
205482	205483	205484	205486	Notorious old rogue	7559	" "
205488	205496	205484	205486	Notorious old rogue	7559	" Pop said , wagging his head . "
205501	205515	205516	205516	He	15379	" he pronounced the words , thereby rendering them much more emphatic . - "
205529	205530	205522	205522	he	15379	" "
205535	205539	205522	205522	he	15379	" Pen said . "
205544	205549	205550	205552	Cut uncle Col	1557	" replied the other . "
205566	205731	205732	205732	They	7561	" and the young sinner took leave of Pen , and the club of the elder criminals , and sauntered into Blacquiere 's , an adjacent establishment , frequented by reprobates of his own age . Colchicum , Blondel , and the senior bucks had just been conversing about the Clavering family , whose appearance in London had formed the subject of Major Pendennis 's morning conversation with his valet . Mr. Blondel 's house was next to that of Sir Francis Clavering , in Grosvenor Place : giving very good dinners himself , he had remarked some activity in his neighbour 's kitchen . Sir Francis , indeed , had a new chef , who had come in more than once and dressed Mr. Blondel 's dinner for him ; that gentleman having only a remarkably expert female artist permanently engaged in his establishment , and employing such chiefs of note as happened to be free on the occasion of his grand banquets . "
205749	205754	205755	205755	they	7561	" Mr. Blondel said , "
205801	205827	205828	205828	I	0	" cried Mr. Blondel , whose grandfather had been a reputable leather - breeches maker , and whose father had lent money to the Princes . "
205838	205843	205837	205837	myself	0	" sighed Lord Colchicum , "
205878	205879	205865	205865	I	0	" "
205895	205901	205902	205902	I	0	" - Major Pendennis said , "
205947	205949	205954	205957	the infernal young scamp	7578	" - "
205959	206220	205954	205957	the infernal young scamp	7578	" said Lord Colchicum glowering at Popjoy out of his heavy eyebrows ; and he turned away from the window as Major Pendennis tapped upon it . The Major was in high good - humour . The sun was bright , the air brisk and invigorating . He had determined upon a visit to Lady Clavering on that day , and bethought him that Arthur would be a good companion for the walk across the Green Park to her ladyship 's door . Master Pen was not displeased to accompany his illustrious relative , who pointed out a dozen great men in that brief transit through St. James 's Street , and got bows from a Duke at a crossing , a Bishop on a cob , and a Cabinet Minister with an umbrella . The Duke gave the elder Pendennis a finger of a pipe - clayed glove to shake , which the Major embraced with great veneration ; and all Pen 's blood tingled as he found himself in actual communication , as it were , with this famous man for Pen had possession of the Major 's left arm , whilst the gentleman 's other wing was engaged with his Grace 's right and he wished all Grey Friars ' School , all Oxbridge University , all Paternoster Row and the Temple and Laura and his mother at Fairoaks , could be standing on each side of the street , to see the meeting between him and his uncle , and the most famous duke in Christendom . "
206230	206406	205954	205957	the infernal young scamp	7578	" were his Grace 's remarkable words , and with a nod of his august head he passed on - in a blue frock - coat and spotless white duck trousers , in a white stock , with a shining buckle behind . Old Pendennis , whose likeness to his Grace has been remarked , began to imitate him unconsciously , after they had parted , speaking with curt sentences , after the manner of the great man . We have all of us , no doubt , met with more than one military officer who has so imitated the manner of a certain great Captain of the Age ; and has , perhaps , changed his own natural character and disposition , because Fate had endowed him with an aquiline nose . In like manner have we not seen many another man pride himself on having a tall forehead and a supposed likeness to Mr. Canning ? many another go through life swelling with self - gratification on account of an imagined resemblance we say "
206409	206600	205954	205957	the infernal young scamp	7578	" because that anybody should be really like that most beautiful and perfect of men is impossible to the great and revered George IV . : many third parties , who wore low necks to their dresses because they fancied that Lord Byron and themselves were similar in appearance : and has not the grave closed but lately upon poor Tom Bickerstaff , who having no more imagination than Mr. Joseph Hume , looked in the glass and fancied himself like Shakspeare ? shaved his forehead so as farther to resemble the immortal bard , wrote tragedies incessantly , and died perfectly crazy - actually perished of his forehead ? These or similar freaks of vanity most people who have frequented the world must have seen in their experience . Pen laughed in his roguish sleeve at the manner in which his uncle began to imitate the great man from whom they had just parted but Mr. Pen was as vain in his own way , perhaps , as the elder gentleman , and strutted , with a very consequential air of his own , by the Major 's side . "
206607	206682	206603	206605	my dear boy	2527	" said the old bachelor , as they sauntered through the Green Park , where many poor children were disporting happily , and errand - boys were playing at toss - halfpenny , and black sheep were grazing in the sunshine , and an actor was learning his part on a bench , and nursery - maids and their charges sauntered here and there , and several couples were walking in a leisurely manner ; "
206950	206960	206961	206961	Pen	799	" A very pious manner of spending his time , "
206977	207041	206961	206961	Pen	799	" Gad , sir , that is not the question . A man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses . When you are a baronet , a county member , with ten thousand acres of the best land in Cheshire , and such a place as Trumpington though he never goes there , you may do as you like . "
207042	207055	207056	207057	the nephew	16078	" And so that was his brougham , sir , was it ? "
207064	207292	207056	207057	the nephew	16078	" His brougham - O ay , yes ! - and that brings me back to my point - revenons a nos moutons . Yes , begad ! revenons a nous moutons . Well , that brougham is mine if I choose , between four and seven . Just as much mine as if I jobbed it from Tilbury 's , begad , for thirty pound a month . Sir Hugh is the best natured fellow in the world ; and if it had n't been so fine an afternoon as it is , you and I would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to Grosvenor Place . That is the benefit of knowing rich men ; - I dine for nothing , sir ; - I go into the country , and I 'm mounted for nothing . Other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me . Sic vos , non vobis , as we used to say at Grey Friars , hey ? I 'm of the opinion of my old friend Leech , of the Forty - fourth ; and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was , as most Scotchmen are . Gad , sir , Leech used to say , ' He was so poor that he could n't afford to know a poor man . ' "
207293	207305	207306	207306	Pen	799	" You do n't act up to your principles , uncle , "
207312	207322	207323	207324	the Major	2155	" Up to my principles ; how , sir ? "
207330	207344	207345	207345	Pen	799	" You would have cut me in Saint James 's Street , sir , "
207348	207382	207345	207345	Pen	799	" were your practice not more benevolent than your theory ; you who live with dukes and magnates of the land , and would take no notice of a poor devil like me . "
207438	207650	207421	207421	He	799	" you , sir , you are my flesh and blood ! Hang it , sir , I 've been very proud of you and very fond of you , but for your confounded follies and extravagances - and wild oats , sir , which I hope you 've sown 'em . I hope you 've sown 'em ; begad ! My object , Arthur , is to make a man of you - to see you well placed in the world , as becomes one of your name and my own , sir . You have got yourself a little reputation by your literary talents , which I am very far from undervaluing , though in my time , begad , poetry and genius and that sort of thing were devilish disreputable . There was poor Byron , for instance , who ruined himself , and contracted the worst habits by living with poets and newspaper - writers , and people of that kind : But the times are changed now - there 's a run upon literature - clever fellows get into the best houses in town , begad ! Tempora mutantur , sir ; and by Jove , I suppose whatever is is right , as Shakspeare says . "
207851	207863	207865	207865	Pen	799	" How Strong must have rejoiced in organising all this splendour , "

Tell Clavering I 'll have a thousand , or by Jove I 'll split , and burst him all to atoms . Let him give me a thousand and I 'll go abroad , and I give you my honour as a gentleman , I 'll not ask him for no more for a year . Give him that message from me , Strong , my boy ; and tell him if the money ai n't here next Friday at twelve o'clock , as sure as my name 's what it is , I 'll have a paragraph in the newspaper on Saturday , and next week I 'll blow up the whole concern .

211802	211810	211812	211814	honest Lady Clavering	693	" No , do n't praise me , "
211816	211857	211859	211860	Lady Clavering	1218	" it 's all the upholsterer 's doings and Captain Strong 's , they did it all while we was at the Park - and - and - Lady Rockminster has been here and says the salongs are very well , "

211885	211898	211882	211882	Pen	799	" It 's not the dowager : it is the Lady Rockminster . "
211899	211902	211908	211908	he	799	" Indeed ! "
211916	211973	211908	211908	he	799	" If you have her ladyship 's approval , Lady Clavering , you can not be far wrong . No , no , you can not be far wrong . Lady Rockminster , I should say , Arthur , is the very centre of the circle of fashion and taste . The rooms are beautiful indeed ! "
212008	212018	212020	212021	Lady Clavering	1218	" Yes , Lady Rockminster has took us up , "
212023	212030	212032	212032	Blanche	1236	" Taken us up , Mamma , "

She is going to give our balls for us ; and wants to invite all our dinners . But I wo n't stand that . I will have my old friends and I wo n't let her send all the cards out , and sit mum at the head of my own table . You must come to me , Arthur and Major - come , let me see , on the 14th . - It ai n't one of our grand dinners , Blanche , "
212246	212259	212261	212262	Lady Clavering	693	" I always think a dinner 's the best the second day , "
212271	212284	212261	212262	Lady Clavering	693	" On the 14th we 'll be quite a snug little party ; "

212419	212436	212437	212438	the Major	2155	" What was that pretty little quarrel which engaged itself between your worship and Miss Amory ? "
212449	212461	212437	212438	the Major	2155	" I thought you used to au mieux in that quarter . "
212462	212467	212469	212469	Pen	799	" Used to be , "
212475	212502	212437	212438	the Major	2155	" is a vague phrase regarding a woman . Was and is are two very different terms , sir , as regards women 's hearts especially . "
212511	212516	212505	212505	they	7849	" cried the elder . "

212645	212649	212644	212644	Uncle	7858	" Pen said . "
212658	212663	212655	212655	I	0	" replied the senior ; "
212694	212718	212686	212686	he	7860	" - and he gave a killing and somewhat superannuated leer and bow to a carriage that passed them and entered the Park . "
212724	212727	212728	212730	mons'ous fine girls	7862	" he said "
212842	212848	212817	212817	They	14293	" continued the veteran moralist , "
212976	212977	212935	212937	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" "
212997	213500	213501	213502	a stunner	14785	" said Pen , quoting the hackneyed ballad of the Devil 's Walk : but his Uncle did not know that poem though , perhaps , he might be leading Pen upon the very promenade in question , and went on with his philosophical remarks , very much pleased with the aptness of the pupil to whom he addressed them . Indeed Arthur Pendennis was a clever fellow , who took his colour very readily from his neighbour , and found the adaptation only too easy . Warrington , the grumbler , growled out that Pen was becoming such a puppy that soon there would be no bearing him . But the truth is , the young man 's success and dashing manners pleased his elder companion . He liked to see Pen gay and spirited , and brimful of health , and life , and hope ; as a man who has long since left off being amused with clown and harlequin , still gets a pleasure in watching a child at a pantomime . Mr. Pen 's former sulkiness disappeared with his better fortune : and he bloomed as the sun began to shine upon him . CHAPTER XXXIX Colonel Altamont appears and disappears On the day appointed , Major Pendennis , who had formed no better engagement , and Arthur who desired none , arrived together to dine with Sir Francis Clavering . The only tenants of the drawing - room when Pen and his uncle reached it , were Sir Francis and his wife , and our friend Captain Strong , whom Arthur was very glad to see , though the Major looked very sulkily at Strong , being by no means well pleased to sit down to dinner with Clavering 's d - - - house - steward , as he irreverently called Strong . But Mr. Welbore Welbore , Clavering 's country neighbour and brother member of Parliament , speedily arriving , Pendennis the elder was somewhat appeased , for Welbore , though perfectly dull , and taking no more part in the conversation at dinner than the footman behind his chair , was a respectable country gentleman of ancient family and seven thousand a year : and the Major felt always at ease in such society . To these were added other persons of note : the Dowager Lady Rockminster , who had her reasons for being well with the Clavering family , and the Lady Agnes Foker , with her son Mr. Harry , our old acquaintance . Mr. Pynsent could not come , his parliamentary duties keeping him at the House , duties which sate upon the two other senators very lightly . Miss Blanche Amory was the last of the company who made her appearance . She was dressed in a killing white silk dress which displayed her pearly shoulders to the utmost advantage . Foker whisped to Pen , who regarded her with eyes of evident admiration , that he considered her "
213504	213805	213807	213807	Taglioni	1189	" She chose to be very gracious to Arthur upon this day , and held out her hand most cordially , and talked about dear Fairoaks , and asked for dear Laura and his mother , and said she was longing to go back to the country , and in fact was entirely simple , affectionate , and artless . Harry Foker thought he had never seen anybody so amiable and delightful Not accustomed much to the society of ladies , and ordinarily being dumb to their presence , he found that he could speak before Miss Amory , and became uncommonly lively and talkative , even before the dinner was announced and the party descended to the lower rooms . He would have longed to give his arm to the fair Blanche , and conduct her down the broad carpeted stair ; but she fell to the lot of Pen upon this occasion , Mr. Foker being appointed to escort Mrs. Welbore Welbore , in consequence of his superior rank as an earl 's grandson . But though he was separated from the object of his desire during the passage downstairs , the delighted Foker found himself by Miss Amory 's side at the dinner - table , and flattered himself that he had manoeuvred very well in securing that happy place . It may be that the move was not his , but that it was made by another person . Blanche had thus the two young men , one on each side of her , and each tried to render himself gallant and agreeable . Foker 's mamma , from her place , surveying her darling boy , was surprised at his vivacity . Harry talked constantly to his fair neighbour about the topics of the day . "
213869	213921	213867	213867	she	1236	" and he began very kindly to hum the pretty air which pervades that prettiest of all ballets , now faded into the past with that most beautiful and gracious of all dancers . Will the young folks ever see anything so charming , anything so classic , anything like Taglioni ? "
213929	213934	213927	213927	herself	1236	" said Mr. Pen . "
213946	213952	213943	213944	Mr. Foker	801	" said the young lady . "
213976	214053	213968	213968	I	0	" Pen remembered that words very similar had been addressed to himself by the young lady , and that she had liked to sing with him in former days . And sneering within himself , he wondered with how many other gentlemen she had sung duets since his time ? But he did not think fit to put this awkward question aloud : and only said , with the very tenderest air which he could assume , "
214081	214082	214078	214078	I	0	" "
214090	214095	214085	214085	you	0	" said Miss Blanche . "
214113	214119	214120	214120	I	0	" Pen said , bitterly . "
214132	214136	214120	214120	I	0	" he continued . "
214190	214191	214192	214192	I	0	" "
214214	214219	214220	214220	I	0	" said Mr. Foker . "
214229	214234	214220	214220	I	0	" said Miss Amory . "
214248	214257	214246	214246	you	1236	" said Pen , with an imploring voice . "
214269	214279	214280	214280	I	0	" asked the Sylphide , turning to Mr. Foker . "
214292	214304	214284	214284	you	0	" and she gave him a perfect broadside of her eyes . "
214315	214321	214305	214305	I	0	" he said , simply . "
214427	214878	214419	214419	they	7893	" In this way the artless youth prattled on : and Miss Amory listened to him with inexhaustible good - humour . When the ladies took their departure for the upper regions , Blanche made the two young men promise faithfully to quit the table soon , and departed with kind glances to each . She dropped her gloves on Foker 's side of the table and her handkerchief on Pen 's . Each had had some little attention paid to him : her politeness to Mr. Foker was perhaps a little more encouraging than her kindness to Arthur : but the benevolent little creature did her best to make both the gentlemen happy . Foker caught her last glance as she rushed out of the door ; that bright look passed over Mr. Strong 's broad white waistcoat and shot straight at Harry Foker 's . The door closed on the charmer : he sate down with a sigh , and swallowed a bumper of claret . As the dinner at which Pen and his uncle took their places was not one of our grand parties , it had been served at a considerably earlier hour than those ceremonial banquets of the London season , which custom has ordained shall scarcely take place before nine o'clock ; and , the company being small , and Miss Blanche anxious to betake herself to her piano in the drawing - room , giving constant hints to her mother to retreat , - Lady Clavering made that signal very speedily , so that it was quite daylight yet when the ladies reached the upper apartments , from the flower - embroidered balconies of which they could command a view of the two Parks , of the poor couples and children still sauntering in the one , and of the equipages of ladies and the horses of dandies passing through the arch of the other . The sun , in a word had not set behind the elms of Kensington Gardens , and was still gilding the statue erected by the ladies of England in honour of his Grace the Duke of Wellington , when Lady Clavering and her female friends left the gentlemen drinking wine . The windows of the dining - room were opened to let in the fresh air , and afforded to the passers - by in the street a pleasant , or perhaps , tantalising view of six gentlemen in white waistcoats with a quantity of decanters and a variety of fruits before them - little boys , as they passed and jumped up at the area - railings and took a peep , said to one another , "
214900	215317	215318	215318	Plush	1592	" - the horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to Belgravian toilets : the policeman , with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion : the shades of evening began to fall : the gasman came and lighted the lamps before Sir Francis 's door : the butler entered the dining - room , and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak dining - table : so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a night - scene of feasting and wax - candles ; and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening , and the wall of Saint James 's Park , and the sky above , in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle . Jeames , with folded legs , leaning against the door - pillar of his master 's abode , looked forth musingly upon the latter tranquil sight : whilst a spectator clinging to the railings examined the former scene . Policeman X passing , gave his attention to neither , but fixed it upon the individual holding by the railings , and gazing into Sir Francis Clavering 's dining - room , where Strong was laughing and talking away , making the conversation for the party . The man at the railing was very gorgeously attired with chains , jewellery , and waistcoats , which the illumination from the house lighted up to great advantage ; his boots were shiny ; he had brass buttons to his coat , and large white wristbands over his knuckles ; and indeed looked so grand , that X imagined he beheld a member of parliament , or a person of consideration before him . Whatever his rank , however , the M.P. , or person of consideration , was considerably excited by wine ; for he lurched and reeled somewhat in his gait , and his hat was cocked over his wild and bloodshot eyes in a manner which no sober hat ever could assume . His copious black hair was evidently surreptitious , and his whiskers of the Tyrian purple . As Strong 's laughter , following after one of his own gros mots , came ringing out of window , this gentleman without laughed and sniggered in the queerest way likewise , and he slapped his thigh and winked at Jeames pensive in the portico , as much as to say , "
215330	215365	215318	215318	Plush	1592	" Jeames 's attention had been gradually drawn from the moon in the heavens to this sublunary scene ; and he was puzzled and alarmed by the appearance of the man in shiny boots . "
215369	215379	215394	215394	he	7896	" he remarked afterwards , in the servants'-hall - a "
215403	215438	215439	215439	Pleaceman	7898	" So , having surveyed the man for some time , who went on laughing , reeling , nodding his head with tipsy knowingness , Jeames looked out of the portico , and softly called "
215441	215488	215439	215439	Pleaceman	7898	" and beckoned to that officer . X marched up resolute , with one Berlin glove stuck in his belt - side , and Jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the individual who was laughing against the railings . Not one single word more than "
215490	215519	215525	215525	you	2261	" did he say , but stood there in the calm summer evening , pointing calmly : a grand sight . X advanced to the individual and said , "
215533	215580	215525	215525	you	2261	" The individual , who was in perfect good - humour , did not appear to bear one word which Policeman X uttered , but nodded and waggled his grinning head at Strong , until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings . "
215592	215674	215589	215589	you	2261	" cries X , in a much more peremptory tone , and he touched the stranger gently with one of the fingers enclosed in the gauntlets of the Berlin woof . He of the many rings instantly started , or rather staggered back , into what is called an attitude of self - defence , and in that position began the operation which is entitled ' squaring ' at Policeman X , and showed himself brave and warlike , if unsteady . "
215684	215697	215678	215678	your	2261	" he said , with an oath which need not be repeated . "
215704	215708	215678	215678	your	2261	" said X , "
215727	215728	215678	215678	your	2261	" "
215746	215757	215678	215678	your	2261	" replied the other with a satiric laugh and sneer - "
215781	215782	215783	215783	Friends	15728	" "
215791	215794	215796	215796	you	2261	" answered X. "
215809	215814	215815	215815	I	0	" roared the other . "
215868	215869	215861	215861	I	0	" "
215879	215986	215861	215861	I	0	" cried Sir Francis within , with a start and a guilty look ; and Strong also , with a look of annoyance , got up from the table , and ran out to the intruder . A gentleman in a white waistcoat , running out from a dining - room bareheaded , a policeman , and an individual decently attired , engaged in almost fisticuffs on the pavement , were enough to make a crowd , even in that quiet neighbourhood , at half - past eight o'clock in the evening , and a small mob began to assemble before Sir Francis Clavering 's door . "
215995	216005	215861	215861	I	0	" Strong said , seizing his acquaintance 's arm . "
216017	216145	216014	216014	you	820	" he added in an under voice to that domestic ; and carrying the excited gentleman out of the street , the outer door was closed upon him , and the small crowd began to move away . Mr. Strong had intended to convey the stranger into Sir Francis 's private sitting - room , where the hats of the male guests were awaiting them , and having there soothed his friend by bland conversation , to have carried him off as soon as the cab arrived - but the new - comer was in a great state of wrath at the indignity which had been put upon him ; and when Strong would have led him into the second door , said in a tipsy voice , "
216185	216224	216225	216225	I	0	" At this audacity the butler stood aghast in the hall , and placed himself before the door : but it opened behind him , and the master of the house made his appearance , with anxious looks . "
216237	216250	216234	216234	I	0	" the intruder was roaring out , as Sir Francis came forward . "
216304	216343	216255	216255	I	0	" The host reflected a moment over his company . There is only Welbore , Pendennis , and those two lads , he thought - and with a forced laugh and a piteous look , he said , - "
216363	216412	216351	216351	I	0	" Colonel Altamont , for the intelligent reader has doubtless long ere this discovered in the stranger His Excellency the Ambassador of the Nawaub of Lucknow , reeled into the dining - room , with a triumphant look towards Jeames , the footman , which seemed to say , "
216433	216500	216501	216503	Very singular man	7918	" and sank down into the first vacant chair . Sir Francis Clavering timidly stammered out the Colonel 's name to his guest Mr. Welbore Welbore , and his Excellency began drinking wine forthwith and gazing round upon the company , now with the most wonderful frowns , and anon with the blandest smiles , and hiccupped remarks encomiastic of the drink which he was imbibing . "
216515	216533	216419	216419	you	2261	" Strong said , with great gravity , the Chevalier 's presence of mind never deserting him - "
216544	216545	216538	216538	they	7921	" "
216548	216581	216582	216582	It	7922	" said Major Pendennis , drily , and wondering what in goodness ' name was the company into which he had got . Mr. Foker was pleased with the new - comer . "
216597	216603	216582	216582	It	7922	" he whispered to Pen . "
216610	216623	216608	216608	sir	2261	" he then said to Colonel Altamont , it 's uncommonly fine . "
216624	216636	216638	216639	the Colonel	18794	" Pines - I 've seen 'em feed pigs on pines , "
216641	216654	216638	216639	the Colonel	18794	" All the Nawaub of Lucknow 's pigs are fed on pines , "
216661	216667	216668	216669	the Major	2155	" Oh , of course , "
216750	216756	216735	216743	a shrewd old gentleman , who drank his wine	7931	" that seemed pretty clear . "
216784	216814	216816	216816	he	18794	" I know you , too , young fellow . I remember you . Baymouth ball , by Jingo . Wanted to fight the Frenchman . I remember you ; "
216851	216863	216864	216864	Strong	1260	" Mr. Pendennis , you remember Colonel Altamont , at Baymouth ? "
216877	216888	216869	216869	Pen	799	" he had the pleasure of remembering that circumstance perfectly . "
216889	216895	216897	216898	the Colonel	18794	" What 's his name ? "
216906	216914	216900	216900	Strong	1260	" Pendennis ! - Pendennis be hanged ! "
216934	216943	216945	216955	the Major , whose dignity was exceedingly mortified by the evening	7935	" My name is also Pendennis , sir , "
216986	217006	217007	217009	The tipsy man	7937	" My name is Pendennis , and I will be obliged to you not to curse it too loudly . "
217145	217155	217141	217141	him	1314	" Captain Beak ! Captain Beak , by jingo ! "
217231	217237	217217	217218	The latter	14046	" Do you know him ? "
217245	217255	217256	217257	the Major	2155	" I am sure I have seen the fellow , "
217270	217300	217256	217257	the Major	2155	" Yes , I have it . He was a deserter from the Horse Artillery who got into the Nawaub 's service . I remember his face quite well . "
217301	217304	217306	217306	Clavering	693	" Oh ! "
217379	217389	217373	217373	Foker	801	" this was the rummest go he ever saw , "
217397	217407	217391	217392	decision Pen	799	" Showed great discrimination on Mr. Foker 's part . "
217563	217578	217579	217579	Foker	801	" Gad ! how I wish I could write verses like you , Pen , "
217586	217627	217579	217579	Foker	801	" If I could do 'em , would n't I , that 's all ? But I never was a dab at writing , you see , and I 'm sorry I was so idle when I was at school . "
217819	217826	217827	217827	he	1589	" Your daughter , Lady Clavering , "
217833	217908	217827	217827	he	1589	" is a perfect nightingale - a perfect nightingale , begad ! I have scarcely ever heard anything equal to her , and her pronunciation of every language - begad , of every language - seems to me to be perfect ; and the best houses in London must open before a young lady who has such talents , and , allow an old fellow to say , Miss Amory , such a face . "
218048	218055	218056	218056	he	2155	" And I say , Pen , "
218068	218094	218056	218056	he	2155	" mind you make a point of calling in Grosvenor Place to - morrow . They 've been uncommonly civil ; mons'ously civil and kind . "
218527	218532	218520	218520	he	801	" Bravo , Hodgen , "
218639	218664	218629	218630	Miss Amory	1236	" Here I am , I am your princess and beauty , you have discovered me , and shall care for nothing else hereafter . "
218714	218718	218711	218711	he	801	" modest women . "
219011	219040	218995	218997	that young gentleman	15628	" Well , old cock , I 've seen many a bad stroke in my life , but I never saw such a bad one as that there . "
219154	219159	219166	219166	he	15628	" How d'ye do ? "
219443	219515	219438	219440	the old gentleman	15207	" Harry , your uncle and I have agreed that when you 're of a proper age , you 'll marry Lady Ann . She wo n't have any money , but she 's good blood , and a good one to look at , and I shall make you comfortable . If you refuse , you 'll have your mother 's jointure , and two hundred a year during my life "
219550	219573	219438	219440	the old gentleman	15207	" Well , sir , if Ann 's agreeable , I say ditto . She 's not a bad - looking girl . "
219574	219597	219599	219600	the Brewer	8078	" And she has the best blood in England , sir . Your mother 's blood , your own blood , sir , "
219602	219611	219599	219600	the Brewer	8078	" There 's nothing like it , sir . "
219612	219622	219623	219623	Harry	801	" Well , sir , as you like it , "
219626	219666	219623	219623	Harry	801	" When you want me , please ring the bell . Only there 's no hurry , and I hope you 'll give us a long day . I should like to have my fling out before I marry . "
219667	219673	219675	219677	the benevolent father	8079	" Fling away , Harry , "
219679	219687	219675	219677	the benevolent father	8079	" Nobody prevents you , do they ? "
219959	219974	219952	219952	her	1236	" Yet round about the spot , ofttimes I hover , ofttimes I hover , "
220594	220608	220577	220577	she	8121	" Why do you go on playing billiards at that wicked Spratt 's ? "
220613	220630	220609	220610	Lady Agnes	973	" My dearest child , those billiards will kill you , I 'm sure they will . "
220631	220638	220639	220639	Harry	801	" It is n't the billiards , "
220644	220653	220655	220657	the Lady Agnes	973	" Then it 's the dreadful Back Kitchen , "
220659	220712	220655	220657	the Lady Agnes	973	" I 've often thought , d'you know , Harry , of writing to the landlady , and begging that she would have the kindness to put only very little wine in the negus which you take , and see that you have your shawl on before you get into your brougham . "
220713	220727	220728	220728	Harry	801	" Do , ma'am . Mrs Cutts is a most kind motley woman , "
220731	220742	220743	220743	he	801	" But it is n't the Back Kitchen , neither , "
220831	220839	220840	220840	she	973	" My son goes to Spratt 's , "
220848	221131	220840	220840	she	973	" All the young men go to Spratt 's after their balls . It is de rigueur , my dear ; and they play billiards as they used to play macao and hazard in Mr. Fox 's time . Yes , my dear father often told me that they sate up always until nine o'clock the next morning with Mr. Fox at Brookes 's , whom I remember at Drnmmington , when I was a little girl , in a buff waistcoat and black satin small - clothes . My brother Erith never played as a young man , nor sate up late - he had no health for it ; but my boy must do as everybody does , you know . Yes , and then he often goes to a place called the Back Kitchen , frequented by all the wits and authors , you know , whom one does not see in society , but whom it is a great privilege and pleasure for Harry to meet , and there he hears the questions of the day discussed ; and my dear father often said that it was our duty to encourage literature , and he had hoped to see the late Dr. Johnson at Drummington , only Dr. Johnson died . Yes , and Mr. Sheridan came over , and drank a great deal of wine , - everybody drank a great deal of wine in those days , - and papa 's wine - merchant 's bill was ten times as much as Erith 's is , who gets it as he wants it from Fortnum and Mason 's and does n't keep any stock at all . "
221132	221145	221146	221148	the artful Harry	801	" That was an uncommon good dinner we had yesterday , ma'am , "
221152	221209	221146	221148	the artful Harry	801	" Their clear soup 's better than ours . Moufflet will put too much taragon into everything . The supreme de volaille was very good - uncommon , and the sweets were better than Moufflet 's sweets . Did you taste the plombiere , ma'am , and the maraschino jelly ? Stunningly good that maraschino jelly ! "
221236	221264	221213	221213	her	973	" Very handsome house that of the Claverings . Furniture , I should say , got up regardless of expense . Magnificent display of plate , ma'am . "
221273	221280	221265	221266	The lady	14974	" Very nice people the Claverings . "
221281	221284	221286	221287	Lady Agnes	973	" H'm ! "
221289	221311	221286	221287	Lady Agnes	973	" I know what you mean . Lady C. ai n't distangy exactly , but she is very good - natured . "
221312	221317	221318	221318	mamma	4982	" Oh , very , "
221334	221384	221395	221395	he	8135	" And Sir Francis , he do n't talk much before ladies ; but after dinner he comes out uncommon strong , ma'am - a highly agreeable , well - informed man . When will you ask them to dinner ? Look out for an early day , ma'am ; "
221485	221501	221465	221465	Harry	801	" You have not asked Miss Whatdyecallem - Miss Emery , Lady Clavering 's daughter . "
221502	221509	221510	221511	Lady Agnes	973	" Oh , that little creature ! "
221514	221523	221510	221511	Lady Agnes	973	" No ! I think not , Harry . "
221524	221531	221532	221532	Foker	801	" We must ask Miss Amory , "
221535	221565	221532	221532	Foker	801	" I - I want to ask Pendennis ; and - and he 's very sweet upon her . Do n't you think she sings very well , ma'am ? "
221566	221606	221609	221610	Miss Amory	1236	" I thought her rather forward , and did n't listen to her singing . She only sang at you and Mr. Pendennis , it seemed to me . But I will ask her if you wish , Harry , "
221929	221931	221935	221935	He	801	" loud "
221974	222005	222006	222007	The valet	15684	" I say , Anatole , when I engaged you , did n't you - hem - did n't you say that you could dress - hem - dress hair ? "
222010	222016	222006	222007	The valet	15684	" Yes , he could . "
222017	222033	222034	222035	Mr. Foker	801	" Cherchy alors une paire de tongs , - et - curly moi un peu , "
222162	222184	222185	222186	the attendant	8163	" At what dime sall I order de drag , sir , to be to Miss Calverley 's door , sir ? "
222195	222210	222212	222212	Foker	801	" Confound her ! - Put the dinner off - I ca n't go ! "
222214	222247	222212	222212	Foker	801	" No , hang it - I must go . Poyntz and Rougemont , and ever so many more are coming . The drag at Pelham Corner at six o'clock , Anatole . "
223160	223180	223182	223182	Warrington	1359	" Would Foker have a pipe and should the laundress go to the Cock and get him some beer ? "
223420	223426	223427	223427	he	801	" Drive to Tattersall 's , "
223441	223448	223449	223449	he	801	" And bring my pony round , "
224004	224018	224019	224020	Mr. Eales	1630	" He plays still ; he is in a hell every night almost , "
224023	224033	224035	224036	a wag	15117	" I should think so , since his marriage , "
224038	224045	224047	224047	Foker	801	" He gives devilish good dinners , "
224060	224073	224074	224075	the wag	8262	" I daresay , and I daresay he does n't ask Eales , "
224078	224097	224074	224075	the wag	8262	" I say , Eales , do you dine at Clavering 's , - at the Begum 's ? "
224098	224103	224105	224106	Mr. Eales	1630	" I dine there ? "
224139	224153	224155	224156	the wag	8262	" You might , you know , although you do abuse him so , "
224158	224203	224155	224156	the wag	8262	" They say it 's very pleasant . Clavering goes to sleep after dinner ; the Begum gets tipsy with cherry - brandy , and the young lady sings songs to the young gentlemen . She sings well , do n't she , Fo ? "
224204	224208	224210	224210	Fo	1632	" Slap up , "
224212	224246	224210	224210	Fo	1632	" I tell you what , Poyntz , she sings like a whatdyecallum - you know what I mean - like a mermaid , you know , but that 's not their name . "
224247	224255	224256	224257	Mr. Poyntz	1633	" I never heard a mermaid sing , "
224264	224281	224259	224260	the wag	8262	" Whoever heard a mermaid ? Eales , you are an old fellow , did you ? "
224282	224296	224298	224298	Foker	801	" Do n't make a lark of me , hang it , Poyntz , "
224311	224342	224298	224298	Foker	801	" you know what I mean : it 's those what's - his - names - in Homer , you know . I never said I was a good scholar . "
224343	224355	224356	224357	Mr. Poyntz	1633	" And nobody ever said it of you , my boy , "
224437	224442	224444	224445	little Foker	801	" What am I , "
224447	224549	224444	224445	little Foker	801	" compared to her ? She 's all soul , she is , and can write poetry or compose music , as easy as I could drink a glass of beer . Beer ? - damme , that 's all I 'm fit for , is beer . I am a poor , ignorant little beggar , good for nothing but Foker 's Entire . I misspent my youth , and used to get the chaps to do my exercises . And what 's the consequences now ? Oh , Harry Foker , what a confounded little fool you have been ! "
224598	224603	224608	224608	he	801	" Harry , Harry ! "
224681	224708	224710	224711	Lady Ann	1055	" What is the matter , Harry ? why are you so pale ? You have been raking and smoking too much , you wicked boy , "
224716	224722	224713	224713	Foker	801	" How do , aunt , "
224723	224729	224744	224744	he	801	" How do , Ann , "
224883	224897	224898	224898	he	1637	" I wonder how the deuce I could ever have liked these people , "
224905	225032	224898	224898	he	1637	" Why , I can see the crow's - feet under Rougemont 's eyes , and the paint on her cheeks is laid on as thick as Clown 's in a pantomime ! The way in which that Calverley talks slang , is quite disgusting . I hate chaff in a woman . And old Colchicum ! that old Col , coming down here in his brougham , with his coronet on it , and sitting bodkin between Mademoiselle Coralie and her mother ! It 's too bad . An English peer , and a horse - rider of Franconi 's ! - It wo n't do ; by Jove , it wo n't do . I ai n't proud ; but it will not do ! "
225033	225043	225046	225047	Miss Rougemont	1609	" Twopence - halfpenny for your thoughts , Fokey ! "
225111	225117	225120	225121	Mr. Poyntz	1633	" Does Foker ever think ? "
225123	225158	225120	225121	Mr. Poyntz	1633	" Foker , here is a considerable sum of money offered by a fair capitalist at this end of the table for the present emanations of your valuable and acute intellect , old boy ! "
225159	225170	225217	225217	her	1638	" What the deuce is that Poyntz a talking about ? "
225178	225193	225171	225172	Miss Calverley	978	" I hate him . He 's a drawlin ' , sneerin ' beast . "
225194	225211	225217	225217	her	1638	" What a droll of a little man is that little Fokare , my lor ' , "
225244	225261	225217	225217	her	1638	" What a droll of a man ! He does not look to have twenty years . "
225262	225271	225273	225275	the venerable Colchicum	8289	" I wish I were of his age , "
225294	225303	225305	225306	Madame Brack	1640	" C'te Jeunesse . Peuh ! je m'en fiche "
225327	225357	225358	225359	My lord	2259	" Je m'aime que les hommes faits , moi . Comme milor . Coralie ! n'est - ce pas que tu n'aimes que les hommes faits , ma bichette ? "
225366	225374	225358	225359	My lord	2259	" You flatter me , Madame Brack . "
225375	225387	225388	225388	Coralie	1638	" Taisez - vous , Maman , vous n'etes qu'une bete , "

225652	225690	225642	225644	this worthy guardian	8308	" I 'm not one of your strait - laced moralists , but an old man of the world , begad ; and I know that as long as it lasts young men will be young men . "
226533	226587	226524	226524	he	2155	" We will go to church , sir , across the Park ; and then , begad , we will go to the Claverings ' house and ask them for lunch in a friendly way . Lady Clavering likes to be asked for lunch , and is uncommonly kind , and monstrous hospitable . "
226588	226605	226606	226606	Pen	799	" I met them at dinner last week , at Lady Agnes Foker 's , sir , "
226609	226661	226606	226606	Pen	799	" and the Begum was very kind indeed . So she was in the country : so she is everywhere . But I share your opinion about Miss Amory ; one of your opinions , that is , uncle , for you were changing the last time we spoke about her . "
226662	226672	226673	226674	the elder	3112	" And what do you think of her now ? "
226677	226689	226690	226690	Pen	799	" I think her the most confounded little flirt in London , "
226694	226725	226690	226690	Pen	799	" She made a tremendous assault upon Harry Foker , who sat next to her ; and to whom she gave all the talk , though I took her down . "
226726	226899	226690	226690	Pen	799	" Bah ! Henry Foker is engaged to his cousin all the world knows it : not a bad coup of Lady Rosherville 's , that . I should say , that the young man at his father 's death , and old Foker 's life 's devilish bad : you know he had a fit at Arthur 's , last year : I should say , that young Foker wo n't have less than fourteen thousand a year from the brewery , besides Logwood and Norfolk property . I 've no pride about me , Pen . I like a man of birth certainly , but dammy , I like a brewery which brings in a man fourteen thousand a year ; hey , Pen ? Ha , ha , that 's the sort of man for me . And I recommend you now that you are lanced in the world , to stick to fellows of that sort , to fellows who have a stake in the country , begad . "
226900	226908	226909	226909	Arthur	739	" Foker sticks to me , sir , "
226966	226967	226960	226960	he	739	" "
226990	226995	226968	226968	I	0	" said the Major . "
227208	227209	227210	227210	Blanche	1236	" "
227218	227222	227212	227214	a dangerous girl	8391	" Pen said . "
227238	227242	227223	227223	I	0	" he added ; "
227249	227250	227252	227252	you	0	" "
227265	227282	227261	227261	she	1236	" asked the Major , looking hard at Pen . Pen , with a laugh , said "
227315	227342	227302	227303	my mother	2288	" Pen did not think it fit to tell his uncle all the particulars of that courtship which had passed between himself and the young lady . "
227354	227366	227352	227352	Arthur	739	" the Major said , still looking queerly at his nephew . "
227391	227400	227385	227385	she	1236	" objected Pen , in a dandified manner . "
227414	227415	227416	227416	You	2261	" "
227505	227506	227509	227509	you	799	" "
227515	227521	227509	227509	you	799	" Pen asked , smiling . "
227538	227539	227522	227522	You	799	" "
227561	227566	227581	227581	she	1236	" the uncle replied . "
227628	227643	227614	227614	you	2261	" and the Major looked still more knowingly , and still harder at Pen . "
227648	227657	227659	227659	her	1236	" he said to his godfather and namesake , "
227672	227673	227671	227671	I.	0	" "
227684	227691	227676	227676	you	2261	" the other replied rather peevishly , "
227721	228176	227717	227719	a beautiful preacher	8414	" Indeed , the bells were tolling , the people were trooping into the handsome church , the carriages of the inhabitants of the lordly quarter poured forth their pretty loads of devotees , in whose company Pen and his uncle , ending their edifying conversation , entered the fane . I do not know whether other people carry their worldly affairs to the church door . Arthur , who , from habitual reverence and feeling , was always more than respectful in a place of worship , thought of the incongruity of their talk , perhaps ; whilst the old gentleman at his side was utterly unconscious of any such contrast . His hat was brushed : his wig was trim : his neckcloth was perfectly tied . He looked at every soul in the congregation , it is true : the bald heads and the bonnets , the flowers and the feathers : but so demurely that he hardly lifted up his eyes from his book - from his book which he could not read without glasses . As for Pen 's gravity , it was sorely put to the test when , upon looking by chance towards the seats where the servants were collected , he spied out , by the side of a demure gentleman in plush , Henry Foker , Esquire , who had discovered this place of devotion . Following the direction of Harry 's eye , which strayed a good deal from his book , Pen found that it alighted upon a yellow bonnet and a pink one : and that these bonnets were on the heads of Lady Clavering and Blanche Amory . If Pen 's uncle is not the only man who has talked about his worldly affairs up to the church door , is poor Harry Foker the only one who has brought his worldly love into the aisle ? When the congregation issued forth at the conclusion of the service , Foker was out amongst the first , but Pen came up with him presently , as he was hankering about the entrance , which he was unwilling to leave , until my lady 's barouche , with the bewigged coachman , had borne away its mistress and her daughter from their devotions . When the two ladies came out , they found together the Pendennises , uncle and nephew , and Harry Foker , Esquire , sucking the crook of his stick , standing there in the sunshine . To see and to ask to eat were simultaneous with the good - natured Begum , and she invited the three gentlemen to luncheon straightway . Blanche was , too , particularly gracious . "
228182	228188	228190	228190	you	8415	" she said to Arthur , "
228225	228239	228221	228222	Mr. Oriel	1644	" And the young devotee jumped into the carriage after her mamma . - "
228252	228262	228263	228263	I	0	" she added , still addressing herself to Pen . "
228268	228279	228263	228263	I	0	" said Mr. Arthur , making rather a pert bow . "
228286	228294	228295	228295	I	0	" asked Mr. Foker , rather puzzled . "
228305	228318	228297	228298	Miss Clavering	1645	" said the Major , looking knowing , and nodding at Pen . "
228352	228353	228337	228337	It	8420	" "
228371	228375	228368	228368	you	8421	" Foker asked . "
228401	228402	228396	228397	his mother	13927	" "
228412	228427	228403	228403	You	8421	" Pen said , laughing , and hooking his arm into his friend 's . "
228459	228460	228451	228451	you	8421	" "
228471	228532	228461	228461	I	0	" Mr Foker answered : at which Pen laughed again , and the three gentlemen proceeded in great good - humour to Lady Clavering 's house . The subject of the novel was resumed after luncheon by Miss Amory , who indeed loved poets and men of letters if she loved anything , and was sincerely an artist in feeling . "
228548	228559	228560	228560	I	0	" she said . Pen said , with some fatuity , "
228576	228601	228573	228574	Miss Blanche	1236	" - and the Major who had not read more than six pages of Pen 's book put on his sanctified look , saying , "
228614	228618	228461	228461	I	0	" and , - "
228627	228638	228640	228640	she	1236	" - Lady Amory declared she would not read it , "
228644	228645	228640	228640	she	1236	" "
228651	228705	228649	228649	mamma	4982	" Blanche said , with a French shrug of her shoulders ; and then she fell into a rhapsody about the book , about the snatches of poetry interspersed in it about the two heroines , Leonora and Neaera ; about the two heroes , Walter Lorraine and his rival the young Duke - "
228715	228721	228710	228710	you	14754	" said the young lady archly "
228748	228754	228745	228746	Mr. Arthur	739	" Pen began to laugh - "
228772	228776	228745	228746	Mr. Arthur	739	" he said . "
228836	228837	228818	228819	the Viscount	8440	" "
228856	228862	228818	228819	the Viscount	8440	" said the young lady . "
228887	229216	229217	229217	I	0	" and she gave him the full benefit of her eyes , - both of the fond appealing glance into his own , and of the modest look downwards towards the carpet , which showed off her dark eyelids and long fringed lashes . Pen of course protested that he had not changed in the least , to which the young lady replied by a tender sigh ; and thinking that she had done quite enough to make Arthur happy or miserable as the case might be , she proceeded to cajole his companion , Mr. Harry Foker , who during the literary conversation had sate silently imbibing the head of his cane , and wishing that he was a clever chap like that Pen . If the Major thought that by telling Miss Amory of Mr. Foker 's engagement to his cousin , Lady Ann Milton which information the old gentleman neatly conveyed to the girl as he sate by her side at luncheon below - stairs , - if , we say , the Major thought that the knowledge of this fact would prevent Blanche from paying any further attention to the young heir of Foker 's Entire , he was entirely mistaken . She became only the more gracious to Foker : she praised him , and everything belonging to him ; she praised his mamma ; she praised the pony which he rode in the Park ; she praised the lovely breloques or gimcracks which the young gentleman wore at his watch - chain , and that dear little darling of a cane , and those dear little delicious monkeys ' heads with ruby eyes , which ornamented Harry 's shirt , and formed the buttons of his waistcoat . And then , having praised and coaxed the weak youth until he blushed and tingled with pleasure , and until Pen thought she really had gone quite far enough , she took another theme . "
229229	229238	229239	229239	He	801	" she said , turning round to Pen . "
229245	229252	229239	229239	He	801	" Pen answered with a sneer . "
229291	229324	229287	229287	you	8449	" But here , seeing that Harry 's countenance assumed a great expression of alarm , while Pen 's wore a look of amusement , she turned to the latter and said , "
229360	229361	229359	229359	I.	0	" "
229366	229370	229364	229364	Blanche	1236	" mamma cried . "
229423	229424	229413	229413	I	0	" "
229432	229449	229429	229430	three bachelors	8455	" the Major here broke out , gallantly , and to his nephew 's special surprise , "
229596	229597	229571	229571	you	693	" "
229602	229606	229571	229571	you	693	" cried Blanche . "
229615	229631	229571	229571	you	693	" said Lady Clavering ; and we will take some day when Sir Francis - - "
229632	229644	229645	229646	the daughter	15103	" When Sir Francis dines out , - yes , mamma , "
229649	229655	229645	229646	the daughter	15103	" it will be charming . "
229739	229748	229749	229749	he	799	" I am an old soldier , begad , "
229752	229764	229749	229749	he	799	" and I learned in early life to make myself comfortable . "
230482	230486	230488	230488	Pen	799	" By Jove ! "
230495	230561	230488	230488	Pen	799	" when I think that these were written but very few years ago , I am ashamed of my memory . I wrote this when I believed myself be eternally in love with that little coquette , Miss Amory . I used to carry down verses to her , and put them into the hollow of a tree , and dedicate them ' Amori . ' "
230562	230572	230573	230573	Warrington	1359	" That was a sweet little play upon words , "
230579	230599	230573	230573	Warrington	1359	" Amory - Amori . It showed proof of scholarship . Let us hear a bit of the rubbish . "
230665	230708	230717	230717	Pen	799	" ' False as thou art beautiful ! heartless as thou art fair ! mockery of Passion ! ' Walter cried , addressing Leonora ; ' what evil spirit hath sent thee to torture me so ? O Leonora . - - ' "
230709	230714	230717	230717	Pen	799	" Cut that part , "
230736	230885	230717	230717	Pen	799	" Well ! do n't read it out at any rate . That 's about my other flame , my first - Lady Mirabel that is now . I saw her last night at Lady Whiston 's . She asked me to a party at her house , and said that , as old friends , we ought to meet oftener . She has been seeing me any time these two years in town , and never thought of inviting me before ; but seeing Wenham talking to me , and Monsieur Dubois , the French literary man , who had a dozen orders on , and might have passed for a Marshal of France , she condescended to invite me . The Claverings are to be there on the same evening . Wo n't it be exciting to meet one 's two flames at the same table ? "
230886	230899	230900	230900	Warrington	1359	" Two flames ! - two heaps of burnt - out cinders , "
230903	230912	230900	230900	Warrington	1359	" Are both the beauties in this book ? "
230913	230921	230717	230717	Pen	799	" Both , or something like them , "
230925	231057	230922	230922	Pen	799	" Leonora , who marries the Duke , is the Fotheringay . I drew the Duke from Magnus Charters , with whom I was at Oxford ; it 's a little like him ; and Miss Amory is Neaera . By gad , that first woman ! I thought of her as I walked home from Lady Whiston 's in the moonlight ; and the whole early scenes came back to me as if they had been yesterday . And when I got home , I pulled out the story which I wrote about her and the other three years ago : do you know , outrageous as it is , it has some good stuff in it , and if Bungay wo n't publish it , I think Bacon will . "
231058	231066	231068	231068	Warrington	1359	" That 's the way of poets , "
231070	231168	231068	231068	Warrington	1359	" They fall in love , jilt , or are jilted ; they suffer and they cry out that they suffer more than any other mortals : and when they have experienced feelings enough they note them down in a book , and take the book to market . All poets are humbugs , all literary men are humbugs ; directly a man begins to sell his feelings for money he 's a humbug . If a poet gets a pain in his side from too good a dinner , he bellows Ai Ai louder than Prometheus . "
231169	231182	231184	231184	Pen	799	" I suppose a poet has a greater sensibility than another man , "
231190	231445	231184	231184	Pen	799	" That is what makes him a poet . I suppose that he sees and feels more keenly : it is that which makes him speak , of what he feels and sees . You speak eagerly enough in your leading articles when you espy a false argument in an opponent , or detect a quack in the House . Paley , who does not care for anything else in the world , will talk for an hour about a question of law . Give another the privilege which you take yourself , and the free use of his faculty , and let him be what nature has made him . Why should not a man sell his sentimental thoughts as well as you your political ideas , or Paley his legal knowledge ? Each alike is a matter of experience and practice . It is not money which causes you to perceive a fallacy , or Paley to argue a point ; but a natural or acquired aptitude for that kind of truth : and a poet sets down his thoughts and experiences upon paper as a painter does a landscape or a face upon canvas , to the best of his ability , and according to his particular gift . If ever I think I have the stuff in me to write an epic , by Jove I will try If I only feel that I am good enough to crack a joke or tell a story , I will do that . "
231446	231455	231456	231456	Warrington	1359	" Not a bad speech , young one , "
231470	231471	231456	231456	Warrington	1359	" "
231482	231483	231484	231484	Their	8498	" "
231499	231504	231507	231507	men	13996	" Mr. Warrington said : "
231513	231514	231509	231509	men	13996	" "
231533	232111	232112	232112	I	0	" Pen answered , at which Warrington confounded his impudence , and resumed his pipe and his manuscript . There was not the slightest doubt then that this document contained a great deal of Pen 's personal experiences , and that ' Leaves from the Life - book of Walter Lorraine ' would never have been written but for Arthur Pendennis 's own private griefs , passions , and follies . As we have become acquainted with these in the first volume of his biography , it will not be necessary to make large extracts from the novel of ' Walter Lorraine , ' in which the young gentleman had depicted such of them as he thought were likely to interest the reader , or were suitable for the purpose of his story . Now , though he had kept it in his box for nearly half of the period during which , according to the Horatian maxim , a work of art ought to lie ripening a maxim , the truth of which may , by the way , be questioned altogether , Mr. Pen had not buried his novel for this time , in order that the work might improve , but because he did not know where else to bestow it , or had no particular desire to see it . A man who thinks of putting away a composition for ten years before he shall give it to the world , or exercise his own maturer judgment upon it , had best be very sure of the original strength and durability of the work ; otherwise on withdrawing it from its crypt he may find , that like small wine it has lost what flavour it once had , and is only tasteless when opened . There are works of all tastes and smacks , the small and the strong , those that improve by age , and those that wo n't bear keeping at all , but are pleasant at the first draught , when they refresh and sparkle . Now Pen had never any notion , even in the time of his youthful inexperience and fervour of imagination , that the story he was writing was a masterpiece of composition , or that he was the equal of the great authors whom he admired ; and when he now reviewed his little performance , he was keenly enough alive to its faults , and pretty modest regarding its merits . It was not very good , he thought ; but it was as good as most books of the kind that had the run of circulating libraries and the career of the season . He had critically examined more than one fashionable novel by the authors of the day then popular , and he thought that his intellect was as good as theirs and that he could write the English language as well as those ladies or gentlemen ; and as he now ran over his early performance , he was pleased to find here and there passages exhibiting both fancy and vigour , and traits , if not of genius , of genuine passion and feeling . This , too , was Warrington 's verdict , when that severe critic , after half an hour 's perusal of the manuscript , and the consumption of a couple of pipes of tobacco , laid Pen 's book down , yawning portentously . "
232123	232127	232112	232112	I	0	" he said ; "
232258	232259	232248	232248	Pen	799	" "
232274	232323	232261	232262	the deuce	3471	" Pen said who , perhaps , may have been nettled by Warrington 's allusion to those ornaments , which , to say the truth , the young man coaxed , and curled , and oiled , and perfumed , and petted , in rather an absurd manner . "
232356	232357	232358	232358	I	0	" "
232369	232373	232358	232358	I	0	" Warrington said , "
232418	232419	232421	232421	I	0	" "
232426	232506	232421	232421	I	0	" said Pen , and ' Walter Lorraine ' went off the table , and was flung on to the coals . But the fire having done its duty of boiling the young man 's breakfast - kettle , had given up work for the day , and had gone out , as Pen knew very well ; Warrington with a scornful mile , once more took up the manuscript with the tongs from out of the harmless cinders . "
232517	232521	232509	232509	Pen	799	" Warrington said ; "
232763	232764	232766	232766	you	0	" "
232772	232788	232766	232766	you	0	" said Pen , delighted , for this was great praise from his cynical friend . "
232801	232809	232794	232794	I	0	" Warrington said in a kind voice . "
232816	232866	232812	232812	you	0	" And with the manuscript which he held in his hand he playfully struck Pen on the cheek . That part of Pen 's countenance turned as red as it had ever done in the earliest days of his blushes : he grasped the other 's hand and said , "
232872	232976	232870	232870	Warrington	1359	" with all his might : and then he retired to his own room with his book , and passed the greater part of the day upon his bed re - reading it ; and he did as Warrington had advised , and altered not a little , and added a great deal , until at length he had fashioned ' Walter Lorraine ' pretty much into the shape in which , as the respected novel - reader knows , it subsequently appeared . Whilst he was at work upon this performance , the good - natured Warrington artfully inspired the two gentlemen who "
232978	233233	232868	232868	you	1359	" for Messrs. Bacon and Bungay with the greatest curiosity regarding ' Walter Lorraine , ' and pointed out the peculiar merits of its distinguished author . It was at the period when the novel , called ' The Fashionable , ' was in vogue among us ; and Warrington did not fail to point out , as before , how Pen was a man of the very first fashion himself , and received at the houses of some of the greatest personages in the land . The simple and kind - hearted Percy Popjoy was brought to bear upon Mrs. Bungay , whom he informed that his friend Pendennis was occupied upon a work of the most exciting nature ; a work that the whole town would run after , full of wit , genius , satire , pathos , and every conceivable good quality . We have said before , that Bungay knew no more about novels than he did about Hebrew or Algebra , and neither read nor understood any of the books which he published and paid for ; but he took his opinions from his professional advisers and from Mrs. B. , and , evidently with a view to a commercial transaction , asked Pendennis and Warrington to dinner again . Bacon , when he found that Bungay was about to treat , of course , began to be anxious and curious , and desired to outbid his rival . Was anything settled between Mr. Pendennis and the odious house "
233237	233508	233509	233509	I	0	" about the new book ? Mr. Hack , the confidential reader , was told to make inquiries , and see if any thing was to be done , and the result of the inquiries of that diplomatist was , that one morning , Bacon himself toiled up the staircase of Lamb Court and to the door on which the names of Mr. Warrington , and Mr. Pendennis , were painted . For a gentleman of fashion as poor Pen was represented to be , it must be confessed , that the apartments he and his friend occupied were not very suitable . The ragged carpet had grown only more ragged during the two years of joint occupancy : a constant odour of tobacco perfumed the sitting - room : Bacon tumbled over the laundress 's buckets in the passage through which he had to pass ; Warrington 's shooting - jacket was as tattered at the elbows as usual ; and the chair which Bacon was requested to take on entering , broke down with the publisher . Warrington burst out laughing , said that Bacon had got the game chair , and bawled out to Pen to fetch a sound one from his bedroom . And seeing the publisher looking round the dingy room with an air of profound pity and wonder , asked him whether he did n't think the apartments were elegant , and if he would like , for Mrs. Bacon 's drawing - room , any of the articles of furniture ? Mr. Warrington 's character as a humourist was known to Mr. Bacon : "
233517	233525	233509	233509	I	0	" the publisher was heard to say , "
233537	233661	233509	233509	I	0	" It is very possible that Mr. Bacon would have set the two gentlemen down as impostors altogether , but that there chanced to be on the breakfast - table certain cards of invitation which the post of the morning had brought in for Pen , and which happened to come from some very exalted personage of the beau - monde , into which our young man had his introduction . Looking down upon these , Bacon saw that the Marchioness of Steyne would be at home to Mr. Arthur Pendennis upon a given day , and that another lady of distinction proposed to have dancing at her house upon a certain future evening . Warrington saw the admiring publisher eyeing these documents . "
233664	233674	233509	233509	I	0	" said he , with an air of simplicity , "
233733	233734	233728	233731	the old English gentleman	8527	" "
233740	233745	233728	233731	the old English gentleman	8527	" said Mr. Bacon . "
233820	233821	233822	233822	I	0	" "
233832	234481	233822	233822	I	0	" thought Mr. Bacon , and the object of these praises presently entered the room from his adjacent sleeping apartment . Then Mr. Bacon began to speak upon the subject of his visit ; said he heard that Mr. Pendennis had a manuscript novel ; professed himself anxious to have a sight of that work , and had no doubt that they could come to terms respecting it . What would be his price for it ? would he give Bacon the refusal of it ? he would find our house a liberal house , and so forth . The delighted Pen assumed an air of indifference , and said that he was already in treaty with Bungay , and could give no definite answer . This piqued the other into such liberal , though vague offers , that Pen began to fancy Eldorado was opening to him , and that his fortune was made from that day . I shall not mention what was the sum of money which Mr. Arthur Pendennis finally received for the first edition of his novel of ' Walter Lorraine , ' lest other young literary aspirants should expect to be as lucky as he was , and unprofessional persons forsake their own callings , whatever they may be , for the sake of supplying the world with novels , whereof there is already a sufficiency . Let no young people be misled and rush fatally into romance - writing : for one book which succeeds let them remember the many that fail , I do not say deservedly or otherwise , and wholesomely abstain or if they venture , at least let them do so at their own peril . As for those who have already written novels , this warning is not addressed , of course , to them . Let them take their wares to market ; let them apply to Bacon and Bungay , and all the publishers in the Row , or the metropolis , and may they be happy in their ventures . This world is so wide , and the tastes of mankind happily so various , that there is always a chance for every man , and he may win the prize by his genius or by his good fortune . But what is the chance of success or failure ; of obtaining popularity , or of holding it when achieved ? One man goes over the ice , which bears him , and a score who follow flounder in . In fine , Mr. Pendennis 's was an exceptional case , and applies to himself only and I assert solemnly , and will to the last maintain , that it is one thing to write a novel , and another to get money for it . By merit , then , or good fortune , or the skilful playing off of Bungay against Bacon which Warrington performed and which an amateur novelist is quite welcome to try upon any two publishers in the trade , Pen 's novel was actually sold for a certain sum of money to one of the two eminent patrons of letters whom we have introduced to our readers . The sum was so considerable that Pen thought of opening an account at a banker 's , or of keeping a cab and horse , or of descending into the first floor of Lamb Court into newly furnished apartments , or of migrating to the fashionable end of the town . Major Pendennis advised the latter move strongly ; he opened his eyes with wonder when he heard of the good luck that had befallen Pen ; and which the latter , as soon as it occurred , hastened eagerly to communicate to his uncle . The Major was almost angry that Pen should have earned so much money . "
234491	234507	234483	234484	the doose	8534	" he thought to himself when he heard of the bargain which Pen had made . "
234621	234679	235013	235014	my dear	13863	" And on this simple calculation it was that the Major counselled Pen . Arthur , laughing , told Warrington what his uncle 's advice had been but he luckily had a much more reasonable counsellor than the old gentleman in the person of his friend , and in his own conscience , which said to him , "
234700	234988	234989	234990	the widow	13904	" And he wrote a letter to her , in which he told her his thanks and his regard ; and enclosed to her such an instalment of his debt as nearly wiped it off . The widow and Laura herself might well be affected by the letter . It was written with genuine tenderness and modesty ; and old Dr. Portman when he read a passage in the letter , in which Pen , with an honest heart full of gratitude , humbly thanked Heaven for his present prosperity , and for sending him such dear and kind friends to support him in his ill fortune , - when Doctor Portman read this portion of the letter , his voice faltered , and his eyes twinkled behind his spectacles , and when he had quite finished reading the same , and had taken his glasses off his nose , and had folded up the paper and given it back to the widow , I am constrained to say , that after holding Mrs. Pendennis 's hand for a minute , the Doctor drew that lady towards him and fairly kissed her : at which salute , of course , Helen burst out crying on the Doctor 's shoulder , for her heart was too full to give any other reply : and the Doctor blushing at great deal after his feat , led the lady , with a bow , to the sofa , on which he seated himself by her ; and he mumbled out , in a low voice , some words of a Great Poet whom he loved very much , and who describes how in the days of his prosperity he had made "
234998	234999	234989	234990	the widow	13904	" "
235016	235030	235032	235032	I	0	" he said , patting it as it lay on Helen 's knee - "
235104	235611	235612	235612	I	0	" We may be sure that the widow and Laura walked out to meet the mail which brought them their copy of Pen 's precious novel , as soon as that work was printed and ready for delivery to the public and that they read it to each other : and that they also read it privately and separately , for when the widow came out of her room in her dressing - gown at one o'clock in the morning with volume two , which she had finished , she found Laura devouring volume three in bed . Laura did not say much about the book , but Helen pronounced that it was a happy mixture of Shakspeare , and Byron , and Walter Scott , and was quite certain that her son was the greatest genius , as he was the best son , in the world . Did Laura not think about the book and the author , although she said so little ? At least she thought about Arthur Pendennis . Kind as his tone was , it vexed her . She did not like his eagerness to repay that money . She would rather that her brother had taken her gift as she intended it : and was pained that there should be money calculations between them . His letters from London , written with the good - natured wish to amuse his mother , were full of descriptions of the famous people and the entertainments and magnificence of the great city . Everybody was flattering him and spoiling him , she was sure . Was he not looking to some great marriage , with that cunning uncle for a Mentor between whom and Laura there was always an antipathy , that inveterate worldling , whose whole thoughts were bent upon pleasure and rank and fortune ? He never alluded to - to old times , when he spoke of her . He had forgotten them and her , perhaps had he not forgotten other things and people ? These thoughts may have passed in Miss Laura 's mind , though she did not , she could not , confide them to Helen . She had one more secret , too , from that lady , which she could not divulge , perhaps because she knew how the widow would have rejoiced to know it . This regarded an event which had occurred during that visit to Lady Rockminster , which Laura had paid in the last Christmas holidays : when Pen was at home with his mother , and when Mr. Pynsent , supposed to be so cold and so ambitious , had formally offered his hand to Miss Bell . No one except herself and her admirer knew of this proposal : or that Pynsent had been rejected by her , and probably the reasons she gave to the mortified young man himself were not those which actuated her refusal , or those which she chose to acknowledge to herself . "
235615	235620	235629	235629	you	8549	" she told Pynsent , "
235688	235689	235690	235691	A dependant	5640	" "
235709	235714	235700	235700	You	0	" Pynsent broke out . "
235724	235788	235715	235715	I	0	" Laura said , sweetly , and indeed I would not be otherwise . Left early a poor orphan , I have found the kindest and tenderest of mothers , and I have vowed never to leave her - never . Pray do not speak of this again - here , under your relative 's roof , or elsewhere . It is impossible . "
235789	235803	235804	235804	Pynsent	1304	" If Lady Rockminster asks you herself , will you listen to her ? "
235808	235811	235812	235812	Laura	741	" No , "
235815	235834	235812	235812	Laura	741	" I beg you never to speak of this any more . I must go away if you do "

237903	237930	237900	237900	he	8570	" unless the - to you insignificant - sum of three pound five can be forthcoming to liberate a poor man 's grey hairs from gaol . "

238679	238712	238671	238671	she	1369	" and you , as an old man , Mr. Bows , and one that pretended to have a regard for us , ought to be ashamed of abetting him in it . "
238882	238886	238887	238887	Strong	1225	" In fact , "
238890	238956	238887	238887	Strong	1225	" Colonel Altamont 's object being financial , and to effectuate a sale of some of the principal diamonds and rubies of the Lucknow crown , his wish is not to report himself at the India House or in Cannon Row , but rather to negotiate with private capitalists - with whom he has had important transactions both in this country and on the Continent . "
239581	239588	239589	239589	Tom	1675	" Give me eighteen hundred pounds , "
239592	239637	239589	239589	Tom	1675	" and I 'm off tomorrow . I take out four men , and a diving - bell with me ; and I return in ten months to take my seat in Parliament , by Jove ! and to buy back my family estate . "
240017	240031	240032	240032	he	1314	" I wish you would put this bear into somebody else 's cage , "
240037	240280	240032	240032	he	1314	" The fellow 's no gentleman . I do n't like walking with him . He dresses himself like a nigger on a holiday . I took him to the play the other night ; and , by Jove , sir , he abused the actor who was doing the part of villain in the play , and swore at him so , that the people in the boxes wanted to turn him out . The after - piece was the ' Brigand , ' where Wallack comes in wounded , you know , and dies . When he died , Altamont began to cry like a child , and said it was a d - - d shame , and cried and swore so , that there was another row , and everybody laughing . Then I had to take him away , because he wanted to take his coat off to one fellow who laughed at him ; and bellowed to him to stand up like a man . - Who is he ? Where the deuce does he come from ? You had best tell me the whole story . Frank ; you must one day . You and he have robbed a church together , that 's my belief . You had better get it off your mind at once , Clavering , and tell me what this Altamont is , and what hold he has over you . "
240281	240291	240293	240294	the Baronet	15718	" Hang him ! I wish he was dead ! "
240776	240782	240783	240783	he	18794	" Nothing like that beer , "
240786	240811	240783	240783	he	18794	" when the coppers are hot . Many a day I 've drunk a dozen of Bass at Calcutta , and - and - - "
240812	240820	240821	240821	Strong	1225	" And at Lucknow , I suppose , "
240827	240846	240821	240821	Strong	1225	" I got the beer for you on purpose : knew you 'd want it after last night . "
240861	240868	240869	240870	the Colonel	18794	" I can not help myself , "
240881	241055	240869	240870	the Colonel	18794	" I 'm a madman when I get the liquor on board me ; and ai n't fit to be trusted with a spirit - bottle . When I once begin I ca n't stop till I 've emptied it ; and when I 've swallowed it , Lord knows what I say or what I do n't say . I dined at home here quite quiet . Grady gave me just my two tumblers , and I intended to pass the evening at the Black and Red as sober as a parson . Why did you leave that confounded sample - bottle of Hollands out of the cupboard , Strong ? Grady must go out too , and leave me the kettle a - boiling for tea . It was of no use , I could n't keep away from it . Washed it all down , sir , by Jove . And it 's my belief I had some more , too , afterwards at that infernal little thieves ' den . "
241056	241064	241065	241065	Strong	1225	" What , were you there too ? "
241068	241082	241065	241065	Strong	1225	" and before you came to Grosvenor Place ? That was beginning betimes . "
241083	241306	240869	240870	the Colonel	18794	" Early hours to be drunk and cleared out before nine o'clock , eh ? But so it was . Yes , like a great big fool , I must go there ; and found the fellows dining , Blackland and young Moss , and two or three more of the thieves . If we 'd gone to Rouge et Noir , I must have won . But we did n't try the black and red . No , hang 'em , they know'd I 'd have beat 'em at that - I must have beat 'em - I ca n't help beating 'em , I tell you . But they was too cunnin for me . That rascal Blackland got the bones out , and we played hazard on the dining - table . And I dropped all the money I had from you in the morning , be hanged to my luck . It was that that set me wild , and I suppose I must have been very hot about the head , for I went off thinking to get some more money from Clavering , I recollect ; and then - and then I do n't much remember what happened till I woke this morning , and heard old Bows at No . 4 playing on his pianner . "
241321	241337	241338	241338	he	1225	" I should like to know how you always draw money from Clavering , Colonel , "
241349	241359	241360	241360	he	18794	" Ha , ha ! he owes it me , "
241363	241378	241379	241379	Strong	1225	" I do n't know that that 's a reason with Frank for paying , "
241382	241389	241379	241379	Strong	1225	" He owes plenty besides you . "
241390	241405	241406	241407	the other	14365	" Well , he gives it me because he is so fond of me , "
241415	241477	241406	241407	the other	14365	" He loves me like a brother ; you know he does , Captain . - No ? - He do n't ? - Well , perhaps he do n't ; and if you ask me no questions , perhaps I 'll tell you no lies , Captain Strong - put that in your pipe and smoke it , my boy . "
241478	241490	241491	241492	the Colonel	18794	" But I 'll give up that confounded brandy - bottle , "
241499	241515	241491	241492	the Colonel	18794	" I must give it up , or it 'll be the ruin of me . "
241516	241524	241526	241527	the Captain	14344	" It makes you say queer things , "
241536	241549	241526	241527	the Captain	14344	" Remember what you said last night , at Clavering 's table . "
241550	241558	241560	241562	the other hastily	8845	" Say ? What did I say ? "
241564	241579	241560	241562	the other hastily	8845	" Did I split anything ? Dammy , Strong , did I split anything ? "
241580	241594	241595	241596	the Chevalier	5178	" Ask me no questions , and I will tell you no lies , "
241672	241675	241676	241676	he	1225	" No , "
241680	241728	241676	241676	he	1225	" you did n't split as you call it , Colonel ; it was only a trap of mine to see if I could make you speak ; but you did n't say a word that anybody could comprehend - you were too far gone for that . "
241770	241779	241781	241782	the Colonel	18794	" Yes , I own to my faults , "
241784	241857	241781	241782	the Colonel	18794	" There is some things I ca n't , do what I will , resist : a bottle of brandy , a box of dice , and a beautiful woman . No man of pluck and spirit , no man as was worth his salt ever could , as I know of . There 's hardly p'raps a country in the world in which them three ai n't got me into trouble . "
241858	241861	241863	241863	Strong	1225	" Indeed ? "
241865	242450	241863	241863	Strong	1225	" Yes , from the age of fifteen , when I ran away from home , and went cabin - boy on board an Indiaman , till now , when I 'm fifty year old , pretty nigh , them women have always been my ruin . Why , it was one of 'em , and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck , and Battens and ermine like a duchess , I tell you - it was one of 'em at Paris that swept off the best part of the thousand pound as I went off with . Did n't I ever tell you of it ? Well , I do n't mind . At first I was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentleman - Colonel Altamont , Meurice 's hotel , and that sort of thing - never played , except at the public tables , and won more than I lost . Well , sir , there was a chap that I saw at the hotel and the Palace Royal too , a regular swell fellow , with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin , Bloundell - Bloundell his name was , as I made acquaintance with somehow , and he asked me to dinner , and took me to Madame the Countess de Foljambe 's soirees - such a woman , Strong ! - such an eye ! such a hand at the pianner . Lor bless you , she 'd sit down and sing to you , and gaze at you , until she warbled your soul out of your body a'most . She asked me to go to her evening parties every Toosday ; and did n't I take opera - boxes and give her dinners at the restauranteur 's , that 's all ? But I had a run of luck at the tables , and it was not in the dinners and opera - boxes that poor Clavering 's money went . No , be hanged to it , it was swept off in another way . One night , at the Countess 's , there was several of us at supper - Mr. Bloundell - Bloundell , the Honourable Deuceace , the Marky de la Tour de Force - all tip - top nobs , sir , and the height of fashion , when we had supper , and champagne you may be sure in plenty , and then some of that confounded brandy . I would have it - I would it go on at it - the Countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me , and we had cards as well as grog after supper , and I played and drank until I do n't know what I did . I was like I was last night . I was taken away and put to bed somehow , and never woke until the next day , to a roaring headache , and to see my servant , who said the Honourable Deuceace wanted to see me , and was waiting in the sitting - room . ' How are you , Colonel ? ' says he , a coming into my bedroom . ' How long did you stay last night after I went away ? The play was getting too high for me , and I 'd lost enough to you for one night . ' "
242451	242639	242683	242683	he	1686	" ' To me , ' says I , ' how 's that , my dear feller ? for though he was an Earl 's son , we was as familiar as you and me . How 's that , my dear feller ? ' says I , and he tells me , that he had borrowed thirty louis of me at vingt - et - un , that he gave me an I.O.U. for it the night before , which I put into my pocket - book before he left the room . I takes out my card - case - it was the Countess as worked it for me - and there was the I.O.U. sure enough , and he paid me thirty louis in gold down upon the table at my bedside . So I said he was a gentleman , and asked him if he would like to take anything , when my servant should get it for him ; but the Honourable Deuceace do n't drink of a morning , and he went away to some business which he said he had . "
242730	242800	242705	242705	they	8854	" ' So , ' says the Marky , ' Deuceace has been with you ; we met him in the Palais Royal as we were coming from breakfast . Has he settled with you ? Get it while you can : he 's a slippery card ; and as he won three ponies of Bloundell , I recommend you to get your money while he has some . ' "
242839	242921	242928	242929	the Marky	1686	" The Marky and Bloundell looks and smiles at each other at this ; and Bloundell says , ' Colonel , you are a queer feller . No man could have supposed , from your manners , that you had tasted anything stronger than tea all night , and yet you forget things in the morning . Come , come , - tell that to the marines , my friend , - we wo n't have it at any price . ' "
243025	243045	243051	243051	he	1686	" ' What little matters ? ' says I. ' Do you owe me any money , Marky ? ' "
243093	243118	243081	243081	he	1686	" ' And mine for two hundred and ten , ' says Bloundell - Bloundell , and he pulls out his bit of paper . "
243220	243294	243209	243209	I	0	" ' A couple of what ? ' says Mr. Bloundell . ' You , of course , are aware that we are a couple of men of honour , Colonel Altamont , and not come here to trifle or to listen to abuse from you . You will either pay us or we will expose you as a cheat , and chastise you as a cheat , too , ' says Bloundell . "
243364	243501	243510	243510	he	0	" ' Monsieur will pay , or Monsieur will give me the reason why . I believe you 're little better than a polisson , Colonel Altamont , ' - that was the phrase he used - Altamont said with a grin - and I got plenty more of this language from the two fellows , and was in the thick of the row with them , when another of our party came in . This was a friend of mine - a gent I had met at Boulogne , and had taken to the Countess 's myself . And as he had n't played at all on the previous night , and had actually warned me against Bloundell and the others , I told the story to him , and so did the other two . "
243684	243719	243674	243675	that woman	14819	" ' Do you think so ? ' says I ; upon which my friend told me how she had actually gone down on her knees to him and ' Save Colonel Altamont ! ' "
243763	243764	243749	243749	She	8871	" "
243772	243792	243770	243770	Jack	1673	" said Strong , with a laugh ; at which the Colonel blushed very much behind his dyed whiskers . "
243808	243812	243804	243804	he	13956	" Altamont asked . "
243895	243972	243982	243982	she	2757	" I swore I would n't touch a farthing 's worth of her jewellery , which perhaps I did not think was worth a great deal , - but what can a woman do more than give you her all ? That 's the sort I like , and I know there 's plenty of 'em . And I told her to be easy about the money , for I would not pay one single farthing . "
243992	243993	243994	243994	They	8877	" "
244007	244013	243997	243998	my Jack	8879	" Strong said , laughing . "
244019	244026	243997	243998	my Jack	8879	" said the other , sulkily ; "
244041	244042	244038	244038	I	0	" "
244051	244055	244056	244056	She	2757	" said Strong . "
244063	244064	244056	244056	She	2757	" "
244114	244165	244177	244177	I.	0	" At this the Countess shrank back from me as if I had said something very shocking . ' Do I understand Colonel Altamont aright ? ' says she : ' and that a British officer refuses to meet any person who provokes him to the field of honour ? ' "
244196	244252	244258	244258	I	0	" ' Colonel Altamont , ' says the Countess , ' I thought you were a man of honour - I thought , I - but no matter . Good - bye , sir . ' - And she was sweeping out of the room , her voice regular choking in her pocket - handkerchief . "
244268	244310	244258	244258	I	0	" ' Leave me , Monsieur le Colonel , ' says she , shaking me off , ' my father was a General of the Grand Army . A soldier should know how to pay all his debts of honour . ' "
244433	244450	244452	244453	the Colonel	18794	" And I ca n't tell you at this minute whether I was done or not , "
244457	244504	244452	244453	the Colonel	18794	" Sometimes I think I was : but then Caroline was so fond of me . That woman would never have seen me done : never , I 'm sure she would n't : at least , if she would , I 'm deceived in woman . "
244566	244573	244575	244575	Strong	1225	" The Governor , by Jove , "
244586	244593	244601	244601	his	18794	" What 's brought you here ? "
244608	244617	244595	244595	Altamont	1314	" It 's no good , I warrant . "
245017	245024	245041	245041	His	15718	" What is it he wants ? "
245050	245054	245055	245055	he	15718	" So sir , "
245061	245070	245055	245055	he	15718	" you 've been at your old tricks . "
245071	245077	245079	245079	Altamont	1314	" Which of ' um ? "
245085	245101	245103	245104	the Baronet	15718	" You have been at the Rouge et Noir : you were there last night , "
245106	245117	245118	245119	the other	14365	" How do you know , - were you there ? "
245122	245174	245176	245176	he	15718	" I was at the Club but it was n't on the colours I played , - ask the Captain , - I 've been telling him of it . It was with the bones . It was at hazard , Sir Francis , upon my word and honour it was ; "
245198	245226	245228	245229	the Baronet	15718	" What the deuce do I care , sir , how a man like you loses his money , and whether it is at hazard or roulette ? "
245245	245346	245242	245242	his	15718	" What I will not have , sir , is that you should use my name , or couple it with yours . - Damn him , Strong , why do n't you keep him in better order ? I tell you he has gone and used my name again , sir , - drawn a bill upon me , and lost the money on the table - I ca n't stand it - I wo n't stand it . Flesh and blood wo n't bear it - Do you know how much I have paid for you , sir ? "
245347	245425	245242	245242	his	15718	" This was only a very little ' un , Sir Francis - only fifteen pound , Captain Strong , they would n't stand another : and it ought n't to anger you , Governor . Why , it 's so trifling I did not even mention it to Strong , - did I now , Captain ? I protest it had quite slipped my memory , and all on account of that confounded liquor I took . "
245426	245549	245242	245242	his	15718	" Liquor or no liquor , sir , it is no business of mine . I do n't care what you drink , or where you drink it - only it sha n't be in my house . And I will not have you breaking into my house of a night , and a fellow like you intruding himself on my company : how dared you show yourself in Grosvenor Place last night , sir , - and - and what do you suppose my friends must think of me when they see a man of your sort walking into my dining - room uninvited , and drunk , and calling for liquor as if you were the master of the house ? "
245550	245567	245568	245568	Altamont	1314	" They 'll think you know some very queer sort of people , I dare say , "
245576	245731	245568	245568	Altamont	1314	" Look here , Baronet , I apologise ; on my honour I do , and ai n't an apology enough between two gentlemen ? It was a strong measure I own , walking into your cuddy , and calling for drink as if I was the Captain : but I had had too much before , you see , that 's why I wanted some more ; nothing can be more simple - and it was because they would n't give me no more money upon your name at the Black and Red , that I thought I would come down and speak to you about it . To refuse me was nothing : but to refuse a bill drawn on you that have been such a friend to the shop , and are a baronet and a member of parliament , and a gentleman and no mistake - Damme , its ungrateful . "
245732	245819	245910	245911	the Baronet	15718	" By heavens , if ever you do it again - if ever you dare show to yourself in my house ; or give my name at a gambling - house or at any other house , by Jove - at any other house - or give any reference at all to me , or speak to me in the street , by God , or anywhere else until I speak to you - I disclaim you altogether - I wo n't give you another shilling . "
245820	245828	245829	245829	Altamont	1314	" Governor , do n't be provoking , "
245833	245898	245829	245829	Altamont	1314	" Do n't talk to me about daring to do this thing or t'other , or when my dander is up it 's the very thing to urge me on . I ought n't to have come last night , I know I ought n't : but I told you I was drunk , and that ought to be sufficient between gentleman and gentleman . "
245899	245908	245910	245911	the Baronet	15718	" You a gentleman ! dammy , sir , "
245913	245926	245910	245911	the Baronet	15718	" how dares a fellow like you to call himself a gentleman ? "
245927	245937	245939	245940	the other	14365	" I ai n't a baronet , I know , "
246137	246138	246133	246134	the Governor	4881	" "
246147	246156	246144	246144	your	15718	" shrieked out the Baronet in a fury . "
246313	246355	246298	246298	I	0	" Almost all Clavering 's assaults ended in this ignominious way , and in a shameful retreat . Altamont sneered after the Baronet as he left the room , and entered into the office , to talk privately with his factotum . "
246362	246369	246298	246298	I	0	" the latter asked of him . "
246379	246380	246376	246376	I	0	" "
246388	246393	246376	246376	I	0	" the Baronet said . "
246664	247250	246652	246652	Ned	1225	" It was necessary for Ned to devise some plan to console the Baronet under this pressure of grief ; and no doubt he found the means of procuring a loan for his patron , for he was closeted at Mr. Campion 's offices that day for some time . Altamont had once more a guinea or two in his pocket , with a promise of a further settlement ; and the Baronet had no need to wish himself dead for the next two or three months at least . And Strong , putting together what he had learned from the Colonel and Sir Francis , began to form in his own mind a pretty accurate opinion as to the nature of the tie which bound the two men together . CHAPTER XLV A Chapter of Conversations Every day , after the entertainment at Grosvenor Place and Greenwich , of which we have seen Major Pendennis partake , the worthy gentleman 's friendship and cordiality for the Clavering family seemed to increase . His calls were frequent ; his attentions to the lady of the house unremitting . An old man about town , he had the good fortune to be received in many houses , at which a lady of Lady Clavering 's distinction ought to be seen . Would her ladyship not like to be present at the grand entertainment at Gaunt House ? There was to be a very pretty breakfast ball at Viscount Marrowfat 's , at Fulham . Everybody was to be there including august personages of the highest rank , and there was to be a Watteau quadrille , in which Miss Amory would surely look charming . To these and other amusements the obsequious old gentleman kindly offered to conduct Lady Clavering , and was also ready to make himself useful to the Baronet in any way agreeable to the latter . In spite of his present station and fortune , the world persisted in looking rather coldly upon Clavering , and strange suspicious rumours followed him about . He was blackballed at two clubs in succession . In the House of Commons , he only conversed with a few of the most disreputable members of that famous body , having a happy knack of choosing bad society , and adapting himself naturally to it , as other people do to the company of their betters . The name all the senators with whom Clavering consorted , would be invidious . We may mention only a few . There was Captain Raff , the honourable member for Epsom , who retired after the last Goodwood races , having accepted , as Mr. Hotspur , the whip of the party , said , a mission to the Levant ; there was Hustingson , the patriotic member for Islington , whose voice is never heard now denunciating corruption , since his appointment to the Governorship of Coventry Island ; there was Bob Freeny , of the Booterstown Freenys , who is a dead shot , and of whom we therefore wish to speak with every respect ; and of all these gentlemen , with whom in the course of his professional duty Mr. Hotspur had to confer , there was none for whom he had a more thorough contempt and dislike than for Sir Francis Clavering , the representative of an ancient race , who had sat for their own borough of Clavering time out of mind in the House . "
247260	247264	246652	246652	Ned	1225	" Hotspur said , "
247326	247371	247372	247372	He	2528	" And if the high - born Hotspur , with such an opinion of Clavering , could yet from professional reasons be civil to him , why should not Major Pendennis also have reasons of his own for being attentive to this unlucky gentleman ? "
247384	247389	247372	247372	He	2528	" the Major said ; "
247614	247727	247602	247602	I	0	" Perhaps Pen was somewhat intoxicated by his success in the world ; and it may also have entered into the young man 's mind his uncle 's perpetual hints serving not a little to encourage the notion that Miss Amory was tolerably well disposed to renew the little flirtation which had been carried on in the early days of both of them , by the banks of the rural Brawl . But he was little disposed to marriage , he said , at that moment , and , adopting some of his uncle 's worldly tone , spoke rather contemptuously of the institution , and in favour of a bachelor life . "
247735	247739	247733	247733	sir	2261	" said he , "
247965	247966	247967	247969	Sir Charles Mirabel	681	" "
247978	248001	247972	247974	a theatrical man	9003	" the Major said , annoyed that his nephew should speak flippantly of any person of Sir Charles 's rank and station . "
248147	248207	248208	248208	I	0	" And the Major began to think that Pen was growing exceedingly pert and conceited , and that the world made a great deal too much of him . The Major 's anger amused Pen . He studied his uncle 's peculiarities with a constant relish , and was always in a good humour with his worldly old Mentor . "
248220	248226	248210	248216	a youngster of fifteen years ' standing	9017	" he said , adroitly , "
248348	248349	248351	248351	he	9021	" "
248360	248369	248355	248355	you	0	" cried the Major , appeased at once - "
248427	248660	248407	248407	you	0	" with which Mentor quitted Telemachus , thinking that the young men were not so very bad , and that he should make something of that fellow yet . As Blaster Clavering grew into years and stature , he became too strong for the authority of his fond parents and governess ; and rather governed them than permitted himself to be led by their orders . With his papa he was silent and sulky , seldom making his appearance , however , in the neighbourhood of that gentleman ; with his mamma be roared and fought when any contest between them arose as to the gratification of his appetite , or other wish of his heart ; and in his disputes with his governess over his book , he kicked that quiet creature 's shins so fiercely , that she was entirely overmastered and subdued by him . And he would have so treated his sister Blanche , too , and did on one or two occasions attempt to prevail over her ; but she showed an immense resolution and spirit on her part , and boxed his ears so soundly , that he forbore from molesting Miss Amory , as he did the governess and his mamma , and his mamma 's maid . At length , when the family came to London , Sir Francis gave forth his opinion , that "
248671	249510	248661	248663	the little beggar	18120	" Accordingly the young son and heir of the house of Clavering was despatched to the Rev. Otto Rose 's establishment at Twickenham , where young noblemen and gentlemen were received preparatory to their introduction to the great English public schools . It is not our intention to follow Master Clavering in his scholastic career ; the paths to the Temple of Learning were made more easy to him than they were to some of us of earlier generations . He advanced towards that fane in a carriage - and - four , so to speak , and might halt and take refreshment almost whenever he pleased . He wore varnished boots from the earliest period of youth , and had cambric handkerchiefs and lemon - coloured kid gloves , of the smallest size ever manufactured by Privat . They dressed regularly at Mr. Rose 's to come down to dinner ; the young gentlemen had shawl dressing - gowns , fires in their bedrooms , horse and carriage exercise occasionally , and oil for their hair . Corporal punishment was altogether dispensed with by the Principal , who thought that moral discipline was entirely sufficient to lead youth ; and the boys were so rapidly advanced in many branches of learning , that they acquired the art of drinking spirits and smoking cigars , even before they were old enough to enter a public school . Young Frank Clavering stole his father 's Havannahs , and conveyed them to school , or smoked them in the stables , at a surprisingly early period of life , and at ten years old drank his champagne almost as stoutly as any whiskered cornet of dragoons could do . When this interesting youth came home for his vacations Major Pendennis was as laboriously civil and gracious to him as he was to the rest of the family ; although the boy had rather a contempt for old Wigsby , as the Major was denominated , mimicked him behind his back , as the polite Major bowed and smirked with Lady Clavering or Miss Amory ; and drew rude caricatures , such as are designed by ingenious youths , in which the Major 's wig , his nose , his tie , etc . , were represented with artless exaggeration . Untiring in his efforts to be agreeable , the Major wished that Pen , too , should take particular notice of this child ; incited Arthur to invite him to his chambers , to give him a dinner at the club , to take him to Madame Tussaud 's , the Tower , the play , and so forth , and to tip him , as the phrase is , at the end of the day 's pleastres . Arthur , who was good - natured and fond of children , went through all these ceremonies one day ; had the boy to breakfast at the Temple , where he made the most contemptuous remarks regarding the furniture , the crockery , and the tattered state of Warrington 's dressing - gown ; and smoked a short pipe , and recounted the history of a fight between Tuffy and Long Biggings , at Rose 's , greatly to the edification of the two gentlemen his hosts . As the Major rightly predicted , Lady Clavering was very grateful for Arthur 's attention to the boy ; more grateful than the lad himself , who took attentions as a matter of course , and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor Pen , who generously gave him one of his own slender stock of those coins . The Major , with the sharp eyes with which Nature endowed him , and with the glasses of age and experience , watched this boy , and surveyed his position in the family without seeming to be rudely curious about their affairs . But , as a country neighbour , one who had many family obligations to the Claverings , an old man of the world , he took occasion to find out what Lady Clavering 's means were , how her capital was disposed , and what the boy was to inherit . And setting himself to work , - for what purposes will appear , no doubt , ulteriorly , - he soon had got a pretty accurate knowledge of Lady Clavering 's affairs and fortune , and of the prospects of her daughter and son . The daughter was to have but a slender provision ; the bulk of the property was , as before has been said , to go to the son , - his father did not care for him or anybody else , - his mother was dotingly fond of him as the child of her latter days , - his sister disliked him . Such may be stated in round numbers , to be the result of the information which Major Pendennis got . "
249517	249529	248661	248663	the little beggar	18120	" he would say , patting the head of the boy , "
249565	249576	249577	249577	He	21316	" At this the widow Amory heaved a deep sigh . "
249591	249808	249585	249585	Major	693	" she said . The Major owned that he knew as much ; did not disguise that he had heard of Sir Francis Clavering 's unfortunate propensity to play ; pitied Lady Clavering sincerely ; but spoke with such genuine sentiment and sense , that her ladyship , glad to find a person of experience to whom she could confide her grief and her condition , talked about them pretty unreservedly to Major Pendennis , and was eager to have his advice and consolation . Major Pendennis became the Begum 's confidante and house - friend , and as a mother , a wife , and a capitalist , she consulted him . He gave her to understand showing at the same time a great deal of respectful sympathy that he was acquainted with some of the circumstances of her first unfortunate marriage , and with even the person of her late husband , whom he remembered in Calcutta - when she was living in seclusion with her father . The poor lady , with tears of shame more than of grief in her eyes , told her version of her story . Going back a child to India after two years at a European school , she had met Amory , and foolishly married him . "
249823	249827	249817	249818	that man	2528	" she said , "
249874	249875	249876	249876	I	0	" "
249879	249887	249876	249876	I	0	" said Major Pendennis , with a bow "
250118	250123	250102	250102	he	2528	" Lady Clavering added : "
250482	250493	250494	250495	the Major	2155	" Begad , she is not such a bad woman ! "
250500	250562	250494	250495	the Major	2155	" She is not refined , certainly , and calls ' Apollo ' ' Apoller ; ' but she has some heart , and I like that sort of thing , and a devilish deal of money , too . Three stars in India Stock to her name , begad ! which that young cub is to have - is he ? "
250727	250734	250735	250736	the Major	2155	" I am an old fellow , "
250739	250836	250735	250736	the Major	2155	" I have nothing to do in life . I have my eyes open . I keep good counsel . I am the friend of both of you ; and if you choose to quarrel before me , why , I sha n't tell any one . But you are two good people , and I intend to make it up between you . I have between lots of people - husbands and wives , fathers and sons , daughters and mammas , before this . I like it ; I 've nothing else to do . "
250880	250889	250890	250890	she	14046	" She could n't speak to him now , "
250910	250933	250894	250894	she	14046	" - anger choked the rest of the words , or prevented their utterance until Lady Clavering had passed out of hearing . "
250941	250952	250937	250939	good Miss Amory	1236	" the Major said , entering the drawing - room , "
251096	251097	251098	251098	I	0	" "
251107	251112	251098	251098	I	0	" said the Sylphide ; "
251125	251126	251122	251123	a saint	9103	" "
251288	251301	251283	251286	the mistress of it	9111	" The Sylphide shrugged her lily shoulders with a look of scorn . "
251316	251320	251321	251321	I	0	" she said . "
251339	251340	251402	251402	you	0	" "
251345	251362	251402	251402	you	0	" said the Major , with the most sentimental and simple air which he could muster . "
251371	251379	251365	251365	I	0	" said Blanche , casting her eyes down "
251388	251389	251382	251382	I	0	" "
251394	251399	251402	251402	you	0	" Major Pendennis cried ; "
251443	251444	251436	251441	a young fellow like my nephew	9118	" "
251448	251455	251436	251441	a young fellow like my nephew	9118	" continued Miss Amory , musing , "
251748	251872	251737	251740	the Angel of Death	9143	" This speech may be interpreted as follows . A few nights since a great lady , Lady Flamingo , had cut Miss Amory and Lady Clavering . She was quite mad because she could not get an invitation to Lady Drum 's ball : it was the end of the season and nobody had proposed to her : she had made no sensation at all , she who was so much cleverer than any girl of the year , and of the young ladies forming her special circle . Dora who had but five thousand pounds , Flora who had nothing , and Leonora who had red hair , were going to be married , and nobody had come for Blanche Amory ! "
251890	251895	251887	251888	Miss Blanche	1236	" the Major said . "
252048	252116	252033	252035	a clever man	9160	" Miss Amory did not of course in the least understand what Major Pendennis meant . - Perhaps she thought over circumstances in her mind and asked herself , could he be a negotiator for a former suitor of hers , and could he mean Pen ? No , it was impossible - He had been civil , but nothing more . - So she said laughing , "
252142	252181	252135	252135	I	0	" At this moment a servant threw open the door , and announced Mr. Henry Foker : at which name , and at the appearance of our friend , both the lady and the gentleman burst out laughing . "
252188	252193	252135	252135	I	0	" Major Pendennis said . "
252216	252240	252213	252214	Miss Amory	1236	" Was Pen growing worldly , and should a man not get the experience of the world and lay it to his account ? "
252248	252253	252213	252214	Miss Amory	1236	" as he said , "
252263	252264	252241	252241	He	14896	" "
252273	252318	252241	252241	He	14896	" he said once to Warrington . Each had come in from his night 's amusement ; and Pen was smoking his pipe , and recounting , as his habit was , to his friend the observations and adventures of the evening just past . "
252324	252328	252320	252320	I	0	" he said , "
252405	252406	252384	252384	She	1369	" "
252410	252415	252384	252384	She	1369	" broke in Warrington . "
252420	252439	252384	252384	She	1369	" Pen said , simply - at which the other burst out laughing according to his wo nt . "
252444	252448	252384	252384	She	1369	" he said , "
252464	252465	252466	252466	You	9175	" "
252473	252481	252466	252466	You	9175	" Pen said , blushing a little - "
252745	252746	252748	252748	you	9195	" "
252778	252782	252785	252785	I	0	" Warrington said . "
252868	252869	252853	252854	old John	1495	" "
252877	252881	252874	252875	a countess	9208	" said Pen , "
252995	252996	252986	252986	her	14228	" "
253000	253004	252986	252986	her	14228	" Warrington said , "
253017	253018	253012	253012	I	0	" "
253119	253120	253122	253122	you	9211	" "
253130	253134	253122	253122	you	9211	" Warrington said . "
253157	253171	253150	253150	you	9211	" Mr. Pen continued , with an air of considerable self - complacency . "
253757	253758	253745	253745	Hoiaper	1721	" "
253778	253785	253772	253772	you	9245	" Warrington cried out , laughing . "
253845	253846	253847	253847	You	9245	" "
253874	253878	253853	253854	old boy	14754	" Pen said . "
254013	254014	254004	254004	Warrington	1359	" "
254034	254049	254026	254026	I	0	" Warrington said , surveying the ardent young fellow with an almost fatherly pleasure . "
254089	254090	254080	254080	Tom	1719	" "
254116	254120	254108	254108	You	9245	" Pen said . "
254132	254133	254134	254134	You	9245	" "
254145	254160	254134	254134	You	9245	" the other answered , with a laugh that was rough and yet tender . "
254214	254284	254285	254286	That philosopher	9283	" Was Pendennis becoming worldly , or only seeing the worldly , or both ? and is a man very wrong for being after all only a man ? Which is the most reasonable , and does his duty best : he who stands aloof from the struggle of life , calmly contemplating , or he who descends to the ground , and takes his part in the contest ? "
254288	254292	254285	254286	That philosopher	9283	" Pen said , "
254450	254555	254557	254557	they	9293	" But the earth , where our feet are , is the work of the same Power as the immeasurable blue yonder , in which the future lies into which we would peer . Who ordered toil as the condition of life , ordered weariness , ordered sickness , ordered poverty , failure , success - to this man a foremost place , to the other a nameless struggle with the crowd - to that a shameful fall , or paralysed limb , or sudden accident - to each some work upon the ground he stands on , until he is laid beneath it . "
254584	254589	254591	254591	he	799	" Look , George , "
254593	254713	254591	254591	he	799	" look and see the sun rise : he sees the labourer on his way a - field ; the work - girl plying her poor needle ; the lawyer at his desk , perhaps ; the beauty smiling asleep upon her pillow of down ; or the jaded reveller reeling to bed ; or the fevered patient tossing on it ; or the doctor watching by it , over the throes of the mother for the child that is to be born into the world ; - to be born and to take his part in the suffering and struggling , the tears and laughter , the crime , remorse , love , folly , sorrow , rest . "
256565	256575	256577	256578	the one	6432	" What a confounded conceited provincial fool that is ! "
256580	256606	256577	256578	the one	6432	" Because he has written a twopenny novel , his absurd head is turned , and a kicking would take his conceit out of him . "
256607	256616	256618	256619	the other	14365	" What an impertinent idiot that man is ! "
256624	256703	256618	256619	the other	14365	" His soul is in Downing Street ; his neckcloth is foolscap ; his hair is sand ; his legs are rulers ; his vitals are tape and sealing - wax ; he was a prig in his cradle ; and never laughed since he was born , except three times at the same joke of his chief . I have the same liking for that man , Miss Amory , I have for that cold boiled veal . "
256734	256779	256725	256725	he	739	" Say ! - Say that you have the most beautiful figure , and the slimmest waist in the world , Blanche - Miss Amory , I mean . I beg your pardon . Another turn ; this music would make an alderman dance . "
256780	256792	256793	256793	Blanche	1236	" And you have left off tumbling when you waltz now ? "
256805	256848	256793	256793	Blanche	1236	" One falls and one gets up again in life , Blanche ; you know I used to call you so in old times , and it is the prettiest name in the world . Besides , I have practised since then . "
256849	256862	256863	256863	Blanche	1236	" And with a great number of partners , I 'm afraid , "
257064	257074	257075	257075	she	1236	" I have nobody to ride with in London , "
257078	257127	257075	257075	she	1236	" Mamma is timid , and her figure is not pretty on horseback . Sir Francis never goes out with me . He loves me like - like a stepdaughter . Oh , how delightful it must be to have a father - a father , Mr. Foker ! "
257128	257133	257135	257136	Mr. Harry	801	" Oh , uncommon , "
257558	257574	257542	257542	Pen	799	" Mamma , mamma ! - take me to mamma , dear , Mr. Pendennis ! "
257873	257883	257885	257886	major Pendennis	693	" He said they make a very nice couple , "
258946	258963	258964	258964	Foker	801	" You fire at everybody , Pen - you 're grown awful , that you are , "
258967	259012	258964	258964	Foker	801	" Now you 've pulled about Blondel 's yellow wig , and Colchicum 's black one , why do n't you have a shy at a brown one , hay ? you know whose I mean . It got into Lady Clavering 's carriage . "
259013	259122	259208	259208	he	799	" Under my uncle 's hat ? My uncle is a martyr , Foker , my boy . My uncle has been doing excruciating duties all night . He likes to go to bed rather early . He has a dreadful headache if he sits up and touches supper . He always has the gout if he walks or stands much at a ball . He has been sitting up , and standing up , and supping . He has gone home to the gout and the headache , and for my sake . Shall I make fun of the old boy ? no , not for Venice ! "
259123	259138	259139	259139	Foker	801	" How do you mean that he has been doing it for your sake ? "
259146	259161	259162	259162	Pen	799	" Boy ! canst thou keep a secret if I impart it to thee ? "
259170	259205	259162	259162	Pen	799	" Art thou of good counsel ? Wilt thou swear ? Wilt thou be mum , or wilt thou preach ? Wilt thou be silent and hear , or wilt thou speak and die ? "
259238	259247	259248	259248	Foker	801	" What the doose are you driving at ? "
259277	259285	259286	259286	he	799	" Henry , friend of my youth , "
259289	259375	259286	259286	he	799	" and witness of my early follies , though dull at thy books , yet thou art not altogether deprived of sense , - nay , blush not , Henrico , thou hast a good portion of that , and of courage and kindness too , at the service of thy friends . Were I in a strait of poverty , I would come to my Foker 's purse . Were I in grief , I would discharge my grief upon his sympathising bosom - - "
259376	259384	259385	259385	Foker	801	" Gammon , Pen - go on , "
259388	259634	259385	259385	Foker	801	" I would , Henrico , upon thy studs , and upon thy cambric worked by the hands of beauty , to adorn the breast of valour ! Know then , friend of my boyhood 's days , that Arthur Pendennis of the Upper Temple , student - at - law , feels that he is growing lonely and old Care is furrowing his temples , and Baldness is busy with his crown . Shall we stop and have a drop of coffee at this stall , it looks very hot and nice ? Look how that cabman is blowing at his saucer . No , you wo n't ? Aristocrat ! I resume my tale . I am getting on in life . I have got devilish little money . I want some . I am thinking of getting some , and settling in life . I 'm thinking of settling . I 'm thinking of marrying , old boy . I 'm thinking of becoming a moral man ; a steady port and sherry character : with a good reputation in my quartier , and a moderate establishment of two maids and a man - with an occasional brougham to drive out Mrs. Pendennis , and a house near the Parks for the accommodation of the children . Ha ! what sayest thou ? Answer thy friend , thou worthy child of beer . Speak , I adjure thee by all thy vats . "
259645	259654	259643	259643	Pen	799	" said the other , still looking alarmed . "
259786	259803	259783	259784	my Foker	9493	" And here Pendennis began to look more serious . Without bantering further , Pen continued , "
259896	259949	259950	259950	We	9501	" They were walking down Grosvenor Street , as they talked , or rather as Pen talked , in the selfish fulness of his heart ; and Mr. Pen must have been too much occupied with his own affairs to remark the concern and agitation of his neighbour , for he continued : "
260024	260025	260012	260014	the old folks	9508	" "
260031	260035	260036	260036	you	9503	" asked Foker , "
260051	260057	260036	260036	you	9503	" Pen shrugged his shoulders . "
260061	260065	260036	260036	you	9503	" said he ; "
260137	260138	260139	260139	I	0	" "
260145	260149	260141	260141	I	0	" Foker said ; "
260156	260157	260152	260152	she	5297	" "
260161	260189	260152	260152	she	5297	" Arthur replied , with a confident smile , which seemed to say , I have but to ask , and she comes to me that instant . "
260195	260237	260152	260152	she	5297	" said Foker ; and he broke out with such a dreadful laugh , that Pen , for the first time , turned his thoughts from himself towards his companion , and was struck by the other 's ghastly pale face . "
260253	260264	260249	260249	You	3653	" Pen said , in a tone of real concern . "
260314	260452	260310	260310	me	0	" Foker said . They were at Mr. Foker 's door by this time , and , opening it , Harry walked with his friend into his apartments , which were situated in the back part of the house , and behind the family dining - room where the elder Foker received his guests , surrounded by pictures of himself , his wife , his infant son on a donkey , and the late Earl of Gravesend in his robes as a Peer . Foker and Pen passed by this chamber , now closed with death - like shutters , and entered into the young man 's own quarters . Dusky streams of sunbeams were playing into that room , and lighting up poor Harry 's gallery of dancing - girls and opera nymphs with flickering illuminations . "
260465	260616	260463	260463	Pen	799	" he said . Ever since the night we dined there , I 'm so fond of that girl , that I think I shall die if I do n't get her . I feel as if I should go mad sometimes . I ca n't stand it , Pen . I could n't bear to hear you talking about her , just now , about marrying her only because she 's money . Ah , Pen ! that ai n't the question in marrying . I 'd bet anything it ai n't . Talking about money and such a girl as that , it 's - it 's - what - d'ye - call-'em - you know what I mean - I ai n't good at talking - sacrilege , then . If she 'd have me , I 'd take and sweep a crossing , that I would ! "
260617	260630	260631	260631	Pen	799	" Poor Fo ! I do n't think that would tempt her , "
260649	260661	260631	260631	Pen	799	" She is not a girl for love and a cottage . "
260662	260716	260717	260717	Foker	801	" She ought to be a duchess , I know that very well , and I know she would n't take me unless I could make her a great place in the world - for I ai n't good for anything myself much - I ai n't clever and that sort of thing , "
260721	260984	260717	260717	Foker	801	" If I had all the diamonds that all the duchesses and marchionesses had on to - night , would n't I put 'em in her lap ? But what 's the use of talking ? I 'm booked for another race . It 's that kills me , Pen . I ca n't get out of it ; though I die , I ca n't get out of it . And though my cousin 's a nice girl , and I like her very well , and that , yet I had n't seen this one when our Governors settled that matter between us . And when you talked , just now , about her doing very well , and about her having money enough for both of you , I thought to myself it is n't money or mere liking a girl , that ought to be enough to make a fellow marry . He may marry , and find he likes somebody else better . All the money in the world wo n't make you happy then . Look at me ; I 've plenty of money , or shall have out of the mash - tubs , as you call 'em . My Governor thought he 'd made it all right for me in settling my marriage with my cousin . I tell you it wo n't do ; and when Lady Ann has got her husband , it wo n't be happy for either of us , and she 'll have the most miserable beggar in town . "
260985	260990	260991	260991	Pen	799	" Poor old fellow ! "
261000	261072	260991	260991	Pen	799	" I wish I could help you . I had no idea of this , and that you were so wild about the girl . Do you think she would have you without your money ? No . Do you think your father would agree to break off your engagement with your cousin ? You know him very well , and that he would cast you off rather than do so . "
261097	261103	261104	261104	Pen	799	" As for my affair , "
261108	261324	261104	261104	Pen	799	" my dear fellow , if I had thought matters were so critical with you , at least I would not have pained you by choosing you as my confidant . And my business is not serious , at least not as yet . I have not spoken a word about it to Miss Amory . Very likely she would not have me if I asked her . Only I have had a great deal of talk about it with my uncle , who says that the match might be an eligible one for me . I 'm ambitious and I 'm poor . And it appears Lady Clavering will give her a good deal of money , and Sir Francis might be got to never mind the rest . Nothing is settled , Harry . They are going out of town directly . I promise you I wo n't ask her before she goes . There 's no hurry : there 's time for everybody . But , suppose you got her , Foker . Remember what you said about marriages just now , and the misery of a man who does n't care for his wife ; and what sort of a wife would you have who did n't care for her husband ? "
261325	261333	261335	261335	Foker	801	" But she would care for me , "
261341	261363	261335	261335	Foker	801	" that is , I think she would . Last night only , as we were dancing , she said - - "
261364	261370	261371	261371	Pen	799	" What did she say ? "
261398	261559	261381	261381	he	799	" Well , never mind what she said , Harry . Miss Amory is a clever girl , and says numbers of civil things - to you - to me , perhaps - and who the deuce knows to whom besides ? Nothing 's settled , old boy . At least , my heart wo n't break if I do n't get her . Win her if you can , and I wish you joy of her . Good - bye ! Do n't think about what I said to you . I was excited , and confoundedly thirsty in those hot rooms , and did n't , I suppose , put enough Seltzer - water into the champagne . Good night ! I 'll keep your counsel too . ' Mum ' is the word between us ; and ' let there be a fair fight , and let the best man win , ' as Peter Crawley says . "
261692	261703	261705	261705	Pen	799	" And so he wants her too , does be ? "
261775	261795	261797	261797	he	799	" She said something to him , did she ? perhaps she gave him the fellow flower to this ; "
261830	261849	261797	261797	he	799	" I wonder to how many more she has given her artless tokens of affection - the little flirt "
263258	263363	263245	263245	Pen	799	" I was in love so fiercely in my youth , that I have burned out that flame for ever , I think , and if ever I marry , it will be a marriage of reason that I will make , with a well - bred , good - tempered , good - looking person who has a little money , and so forth , that will cushion our carriage in its course through life . As for romance , it is all done ; I have spent that out , and am old before my time - I 'm proud of it . "
263364	263367	263369	263370	the other	14365	" Stuff ! "
263372	263418	263369	263370	the other	14365	" you fancied you were getting bald the other day , and bragged about it as you do about everything . But you began to use the bear's - grease pot directly the hairdresser told you ; and are scented like a barber ever since . "
263419	263424	263425	263426	the other	14365	" You are Diogenes , "

263666	263674	263656	263656	he	739	" Editor of Pall Mall Gazette and friend "
263901	263926	263934	263936	the elder lady	9638	" Bedad , sir , if ye doubt me honour , will ye obleege me by stipping out of that box , and - - "
263927	263932	263934	263936	the elder lady	9638	" Lor , Capting ! "
263938	263944	263946	263950	the man in the box	9639	" Do n't bother me , "
264107	264108	264088	264088	ye'd	9641	" "
264125	264146	264117	264117	I	0	" the check - taker said ; on which the Captain swore an oath , and the elder lady said , "
264152	264168	264117	264117	I	0	" As for the young one , she looked up at the Captain and said , "
264192	264218	264190	264190	mamma	4982	" And with this , although she did not want to go at all , her feelings overcame her , and she began to cry . "
264223	264228	264190	264190	mamma	4982	" the Captain said . "
264246	264247	264190	264190	mamma	4982	" "
264254	264281	264190	264190	mamma	4982	" cried the doorkeeper , peevishly , out of the illuminated box . And at this minute Arthur came up , and recognising Costigan , said , "
264292	264308	264290	264290	Pendennis	739	" And he took off his hat and made a bow to the two ladies . "
264317	264340	264290	264290	Pendennis	739	" cried the Captain , extending towards Pendennis the grasp of friendship ; and he rapidly explained to the other what he called "
264346	264627	264290	264290	Pendennis	739	" He had an order for Vauxhall , admitting two , from Mr. Hodgen , then within the Gardens , and singing as he did at the Back Kitchen and the nobility 's concerts , the ' Body Snatcher , ' the ' Death of General Wolfe , ' the ' Banner of Blood , ' and other favourite melodies ; and , having this order for the admission of two persons , he thought that it would admit three , and had come accordingly to the Gardens with his friends . But , on his way , Captain Costigan had lost the paper of admission - it was not forthcoming at all ; and the leedies must go back again , to the great disappointment of one of them , as Pendennis saw . Arthur had a great deal of good - nature for everybody , and sympathised with the misfortunes of all sorts of people : how could he refuse his sympathy in such a case as this ? He had seen the innocent face as it looked up to the Captain , the appealing look of the girl , the piteous quiver of the mouth , and the final outburst of tears . If it had been his last guinea in the world , he must have paid it to have given the poor little thing pleasure . She turned the sad imploring eyes away directly they lighted upon a stranger , and began to wipe them with her handkerchief . Arthur looked very handsome and kind as he stood before the women , with his hat off , blushing , bowing , generous , a gentleman . "
264632	264648	264290	264290	Pendennis	739	" he asked of himself . He thought he had seen the elder lady before . "
264662	264668	264669	264669	I	0	" the young man said , "
264720	264886	264887	264887	Fanny	986	" The first impulse of the Prince of Fairoaks was to pay for the whole party , and to make away with his newspaper order as poor Costigan had done with his own ticket . But his instinct , and the appearance of the two women , told him that they would be better pleased if he did not give himself the airs of a grand seigneur , and he handed his purse to Costigan , and laughingly pulled out his ticket with one hand , as he offered the other to the elder of the ladies - ladies was not the word - they had bonnets and shawls , and collars and ribbons , and the youngest showed a pretty little foot and boot under her modest grey gown , but his Highness of Fairoaks was courteous to every person who wore a petticoat whatever its texture was , and the humbler the wearer , only the more stately and polite in his demeanour . "
264895	264900	264887	264887	Fanny	986	" the elder said ; "
264934	265033	265034	265034	Fanny	986	" Fanny made a little curtsey , and put her hand under Arthur 's arm . It had on a shabby little glove , but it was pretty and small . She was not a child , but she was scarcely a woman as yet ; her tears had dried up , and her cheek mantled with youthful blushes , and her eyes glistened with pleasure and gratitude , as she looked up into Arthur 's kind face . Arthur , in a protecting way , put his other hand upon the little one resting on his arm . "
265042	265046	265054	265054	you	9668	" he said , "
265056	265057	265054	265054	you	9668	" "
265070	265077	265058	265058	We	9669	" Fanny said with a curtsey ; "
265110	265186	265089	265089	Papa	953	" She shrank back as she spoke , starting with wonder and delight as she saw the Royal Gardens blaze before her with a hundred million of lamps , with a splendour such as the finest fairy tale , the finest pantomime she had ever witnessed at the theatre , had never realised . Pen was pleased with her pleasure , and pressed to his side the little hand which clung so kindly to him . "
265199	265206	265207	265207	Your	9673	" said the blase young man . "
265216	265225	265207	265207	Your	9673	" said the Captain 's voice behind him . "
265326	265904	265318	265319	Mr. Simpson	1759	" If Pen was magnificent in his courtesy to the ladies , what was his splendour in comparison to Captain Costigan 's bowing here and there , and crying bravo to the singers ? A man , descended like Costigan , from a long line of Hibernian kings , chieftains , and other magnates and sheriffs of the county , had of course too much dignity and self - respect to walk arrum - in - arrum as the Captain phrased it with a lady who occasionally swept his room out , and cooked his mutton - chops . In the course of their journey from Shepherd 's Inn to Vauxhall Gardens , Captain Costigan had walked by the side of the two ladies , in a patronising and affable manner pointing out to them the edifices worthy of note , and discoorsing , according to his wo nt , about other cities and countries which he had visited , and the people of rank and fashion with whom he had the honour of an acquaintance . Nor could it be expected , nor , indeed , did Mrs. Bolton expect , that , arrived in the Royal property , and strongly illuminated by the flare of the twenty thousand additional lamps , the Captain could relax from his dignity , and give an arm to a lady who was , in fact , little better than a housekeeper or charwoman . But Pen , on his part , had no such scruples . Miss Fanny Bolton did not make his bed nor sweep his chambers ; and he did not choose to let go his pretty little partner . As for Fanny , her colour heightened , and her bright eyes shone the brighter with pleasure , as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as Mr. Pen . And she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place , and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there ; and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and grander - looking than any other gent in the place . Of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks there - rakish young surgeons , fast young clerks and commercialists , occasional dandies of the Guard regiments , and the rest . Old Lord Colchicum was there in attendance upon Mademoiselle Caracoline , who had been riding in the ring ; and who talked her native French very loud , and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about , leaning on the arm of his lordship . Colchicum was in attendance upon Mademoiselle Carandine , little Tom Tufthunt was in attendance upon Lord Colchicum ; and rather pleased , too , with his position . When Don Juan scalles the wall , there 's never a want of a Leporello to hold the ladder . Tom Tufthunt was quite happy to act as friend to the elderly viscount , and to carve the fowl , and to make the salad at supper . When Pen and his young lady met the Viscount 's party , that noble poor only gave Arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordship 's eyes passed from Pen 's face under the bonnet of Pen 's companion . But Tom Tufthunt wagged his head very good - naturedly at Mr. Arthur , and said , "
265912	265924	265907	265907	you	9682	" and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history . "
265940	265950	265937	265937	her	9684	" Miss Bolton said , looking after Mademoiselle Caracoline ; "
265967	265968	265961	265965	the gentleman in the ring	9686	" "
265978	266543	265975	265976	Miss Fanny	986	" said Pen with an air of protection . He meant no harm ; he was pleased to patronise the young girl , and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty , and that she should be hanging upon his arm , and that yonder elderly Don Juan should have seen her there . Fanny was very pretty ; her eyes were dark and brilliant , her teeth were like little pearls ; her mouth was almost as red as Mademoiselle Caracoline 's when the latter had put on her vermilion . And what a difference there was between the one 's voice and the other 's , between the girl 's laugh and the woman 's ! It was only very lately , indeed , that Fanny , when looking in the little glass over the Bows - Costigan mantelpiece as she was dusting it had begun to suspect that she was a beauty . But a year ago , she was a clumsy , gawky girl , at whom her father sneered , and of whom the girls at the day - school Miss Minifer 's , Newcastle Street , Strand ; Miss M. , the younger sister , took the leading business at the Norwich circuit in 182 - ; and she herself had played for two seasons with some credit T. R. E. O. , T. R. S. W. , until she fell down a trap - door and broke her leg ; the girls at Fanny 's school , we say , took no account of her , and thought her a dowdy little creature as long as she remained under Miss Minifer 's instruction . And it was unremarked and almost unseen in the porter 's dark lodge of Shepherd 's Inn , that this little flower bloomed into beauty . So this young person hung upon Mr. Pen 's arm , and they paced the gardens together , Empty as London was , there were still some two millions of people left lingering about it , and amongst them , one or two of the acquaintances of Mr. Arthur Pendennis . Amongst them , silent and alone , pale , with his hands in his pockets , and a rueful nod of the head to Arthur as they met , passed Henry Foker , Esq . Young Henry was trying to ease his mind by moving from place to place , and from excitement to excitement . But he thought about Blanche as he sauntered in the dark walks ; he thought about Blanche as he looked at the devices of the lamps . He consulted the fortune - teller about her , and was disappointed when that gipsy told him that he was in love with a dark lady who would make him happy ; and at the concert , though Mr. Momus sang his most stunning comic songs , and asked his most astonishing riddles , never did a kind smile come to visit Foker 's lips . In fact , he never heard Mr. Momus at all . Pen and Miss Bolton were hard by listening to the same concert , and the latter remarked , and Pen laughed at Mr. Fokei 's woebegone face . Fanny asked what it was that made that odd - looking little man so dismal ? "
266552	266557	266546	266546	he	9687	" Pen , said . "
266570	266600	266605	266605	he	9687	" And he looked down at her , splendidly protecting her , like Egmont at Clara in Goethe 's play , or Leicester at Amy in Scott 's novel . "
266610	266641	266607	266608	poor gentleman	9689	" said Fanny with a sigh , and her eyes turned round towards him with no little kindness and pity - but Harry did not see the beautiful dark eyes . "
266649	266720	266643	266643	dy	9690	" - a voice broke in here - it was that of a young man in a large white coat with a red neckcloth , over which a dingy shirt - collar was turned so as to exhibit a dubious neck - with a large pin of bullion or other metal , and an imaginative waistcoat with exceedingly fanciful glass buttons , and trousers that cried with a loud voice , "
266742	266765	266738	266740	a dirty buck	9692	" and a little stick in one pocket of his coat , and a lady in pink satin on the other arm - "
266782	266783	266777	266777	Huxter	896	" "
266792	266804	266789	266790	Mr. Huxter	896	" the Prince of Fairoaks said in his most princely manner - "
266812	266813	266805	266805	I	0	" "
266819	266828	266829	266829	I	0	" - And Mr. Huxter wagged his head . "
266925	266967	266968	266968	You	739	" And with this Mr. Huxter released his hand from the pocket where his cane was , and pulling off the top of his card - case with his teeth produced thence a visiting ticket , which he handed to Pen . "
266977	266981	266968	266968	You	739	" said Pen : "
267002	267098	267101	267102	old fellow	2681	" And the Marquis of Fairoaks , wondering that such a creature as this could have the audacity to give him a card , put Mr. Huxter 's card into his waistcoat pocket with a lofty courtesy . Possibly Mr. Samuel Huxter was not aware that there was any great social difference between Mr. Arthur Pendennis and himself . Mr. Huxter 's father was a surgeon and apothecary at Clavering just as Mr. Pendennis 's papa had been a surgeon and apothecary at Bath . But the impudence of some men is beyond all calculation . "
267107	267129	267101	267102	old fellow	2681	" said Mr. Huxter , who , always frank and familiar , was from vinous excitement even more affable than usual . "
267175	267567	267173	267173	Mary	1717	" And he set off running with the rest of the crowd in the direction of the fireworks . So did Pen presently , when this agreeable youth was out of sight , begin to run with his little companion ; Mrs. Bolton following after them , with Captain Costigan at her side . But the Captain was too majestic and dignified in his movements to run for friend or enemy , and he pursued his course with the usual jaunty swagger which distinguished his steps , so that he and his companion were speedily distanced by Pen and Miss Fanny . Perhaps Arthur forgot , or perhaps he did not choose to remember , that the elder couple had no money in their pockets , as had been proved by their adventure at the entrance of the Gardens ; howbeit , Pen paid a couple of shillings for himself and his partner , and with her hanging close on his arm , scaled the staircase which leads to the firework gallery . The Captain and mamma might have followed them if they liked , but Arthur and Fanny were too busy to look back . People were pushing and squeezing there beside and behind them . One eager individual rushed by Fanny , and elbowed her so , that she fell back with a little cry , upon which , of course , Arthur caught her adroitly in his arms , and , just for protection , kept her so defended , until they mounted the stair , and took their places . Poor Foker sate alone on one of the highest benches , his face illuminated by the fireworks , or in their absence by the moon . Arthur saw him , and laughed , but did not occupy himself about his friend much . He was engaged with Fanny . How she wondered ! how happy she was ! how she cried O , O , O , as the rockets soared into the air , and showered down in azure , and emerald , and vermilion ! As these wonders blazed and disappeared before her , the little girl thrilled and trembled with delight at Arthur 's side - her hand was under his arm still , he felt it pressing him as she looked up delighted . "
267575	267579	267573	267573	sir	2261	" she cried . "
267588	267603	267586	267586	Fanny	986	" Arthur said . A quick blush rushed up into the girl 's face . "
267610	267623	267606	267606	I	0	" she said , in a low voice , sweet and tremulous . "
267634	267635	267638	267638	Fanny	986	" "
267653	267662	267663	267663	I	0	" Pendennis said , very kindly and gently . "
267669	267670	267667	267667	Fanny	986	" "
267674	267708	267667	267667	Fanny	986	" she said , and the little hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly , and the girl clung to him so that he could feel her heart beating on his shoulder . "
267927	268221	267924	267925	little girl	9721	" Here Pen broke out , rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver ; for the sight of a woman 's tears always put his nerves in a quiver , and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her , and to utter a hundred and twenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy , which need not be repeated here , because they would be absurd in print . So would a mother 's talk to a child be absurd in print ; so would a lover 's to his bride . That sweet artless poetry bears no translation ; and is too subtle for grammarians ' clumsy definitions . You have but the same four letters to describe the salute which you perform on your grandmother 's forehead , and that which you bestow on the sacred cheek of your mistress ; but the same four letters , and not one of them a labial . Do we mean to hint that r. Arthur Pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question ? Not so . In the first place , it was dark : the fireworks were over , and nobody could see him ; secondly , he was not a man to have this kind of secret , and tell it ; thirdly and lastly , let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl , say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture ? Well , the truth is , that however you may suspect him , and whatever you would have done under the circumstances , or Mr. Pen would have liked to do , he behaved honestly , and like a man . "
268233	268239	268222	268222	I	0	" he said within himself , "
268320	268409	268314	268315	your mamma	2537	" And there , indeed , Mrs. Bolton was , unquiet in spirit , and grasping her umbrella . She seized Fanny with maternal fierceness and eagerness , and uttered some rapid abuse to the girl in an undertone . The expression in Captain Costigan 's eye - standing behind the matron and winking at Pendennis from under his hat - was , I am bound to say , indefinably humorous . It was so much so , that Pen could not refrain from bursting into a laugh . "
268420	268427	268417	268418	Mrs. Bolton	842	" he said , offering it . "
268463	268464	268461	268461	we	9725	" "
268468	268479	268461	268461	we	9725	" said Miss Fanny , with rather a demure look . "
268486	268490	268461	268461	we	9725	" said Pen . "
268518	268519	268508	268508	you	13915	" "
268522	268526	268508	268508	you	13915	" said Costigan , "
268551	268571	268541	268541	I	0	" Mrs. Bolton with considerable asperity said , She ad an eadache , and would much rather go ome . "
268586	268591	268541	268541	I	0	" Pen said gallantly , "
268696	268920	268922	268931	a foin young English gentleman of th ' olden toime	9732	" The cab , the lobster salad , the frank and good - humoured look of Pendennis , as he smilingly invited the worthy matron , subdued her suspicions and her anger . Since he would be so obliging , she thought she could take a little bit of lobster , and so they all marched away to a box ; and Costigan called for a waither with such a loud and belligerent voice , as caused one of those officials instantly to run to him . The carte was examined on the wall , and Fanny was asked to choose her favourite dish ; upon which the young creature said she was fond of lobster , too , but also owned to a partiality for raspberry tart . This delicacy was provided by Pen , and a bottle of the most frisky champagne was moreover ordered for the delight of the ladies . Little Fanny drank this ; - what other sweet intoxication had she not drunk in the course of the night ? When the supper , which was very brisk and gay , was over , and Captain Costigan and Mrs. Bolton had partaken of some of the rack - punch that is so fragrant at Vauxhall , the bill was called and discharged by Pen with great generosity , - "
268936	269102	268934	268934	Jove	1002	" Costigan enthusiastically remarked . And as , when they went out of the box , he stepped forward and gave Mrs. Bolton his arm , Fanny fell to Pen 's lot , and the young people walked away in high good - humour together , in the wake of their seniors . The champagne and the rack - punch , though taken in moderation by all persons , except perhaps poor Cos , who lurched ever so little in his gait , had set them in high spirits and good - humour , so that Fanny began to skip and move her brisk little feet in time to the band , which was playing waltzes and galops for the dancers . As they came up to the dancing , the music and Fanny 's feet seemed to go quicker together - she seemed to spring , as if naturally , from the ground , and as if she required repression to keep her there . "
269110	269117	269105	269105	you	9733	" said the Prince of Fairoaks . "
269137	269144	269131	269131	me	0	" Upon which Mr. Costigan said , "
269149	269390	269131	269131	me	0	" and Mrs. Bolton not refusing indeed , she was an old war - horse , and would have liked , at the trumpet 's sound , to have entered the arena herself , Fanny 's shawl was off her back in a minute , and she and Arthur were whirling round in a waltz in the midst of a great deal of queer , but exceedingly joyful company . Pen had no mishap this time with little Fanny , as he had with Miss Blanche in old days , - at least , there was no mishap of his making . The pair danced away with great agility and contentment , - first a waltz , then a galop , then a waltz again , until , in the second waltz , they were bumped by another couple who had joined the Terpsichorean choir . This was Mr. Huxter and his pink satin young friend , of whom we have already had a glimpse . Mr. Huxter very probably had been also partaking of supper , for he was even more excited now than at the time when he had previously claimed Pen 's acquaintance ; and , having run against Arthur and his partner , and nearly knocked them down , this amiable gentleman of course began to abuse the people whom he had injured , and broke out into a volley of slang against the unoffending couple . "
269411	269597	269407	269409	old Slow Coach	9736	" the young surgeon roared out using , at the same time , other expressions far more emphatic , and was joined in his abuse by the shrill language and laughter of his partner ; to the interruption of the ball , the terror of poor little Fanny , and the immense indignation of Pen . Arthur was furious ; and not so angry at the quarrel as at the shame attending it . A battle with a fellow like that ! A row in a public garden , and with a porter 's daughter on his arm ! What a position for Arthur Pendennis ! He drew poor little Fanny hastily away from the dancers to her mother , and wished that lady , and Costigan , and poor Fanny underground , rather than there , in his companionship , and under his protection . When Huxter commenced his attack , that free - spoken young gentleman had not seen who was his opponent ; and directly he was aware that it was Arthur whom he had insulted , he began to make apologies . "
269605	269612	269603	269603	Mary	1717	" he said to his partner . "
269639	269830	269634	269634	you	9737	" Mr. Huxter had been one of the boys of the Clavering School , who had been present at a combat which has been mentioned in the early part of this story , when young Pen knocked down the biggest champion of the academy , and Huxter knew that it was dangerous to quarrel with Arthur . His apologies were as odious to the other as his abuse had been . Pen stopped his tipsy remonstrance , by telling him to hold his tongue , and desiring him not to use his Pendennis 's name in that place or any other ; and he walked out of the gardens with a titter behind him from the crowd , every one of whom he would have liked to massacre for having been witness to the degrading broil . He walked out of the gardens , quite forgetting poor little Fanny , who came trembling behind him with her mother and the stately Costigan . He was brought back to himself by a word from the Captain , who touched him on the shoulder just as they were passing the inner gate . "
269842	269847	269634	269634	you	9737	" the Captain said . "
269861	269867	269858	269858	your	9741	" Pen burst out laughing . "
269886	269890	269874	269874	you	0	" he asked . "
269901	269907	269874	269874	you	0	" cried out little Fanny . "
269918	269937	269915	269916	Captain Costigan	847	" The Captain muttered something about honour , and winked knowingly at Pen , but Arthur said gallantly , "
269972	270041	269960	269960	I	0	" And he gave her his arm once more , and called a cab , and put his three friends into it . He was about to pay the driver , and to take another carriage for himself , when little Fanny , still alarmed , put her little hand out , and caught him by the coat , and implored him and besought him to come in . "
270047	270057	269960	269960	I	0	" said Pen , in great good - humour , "
270085	270162	270168	270168	his	14344	" The cab drove to its destination . Arthur was immensely pleased by the girl 's solicitude about him : her tender terrors quite made him forget his previous annoyance . Pen put the ladies into their lodge , having shaken hands kindly with both of them ; and the Captain again whispered to him that he would see um in the morning if he was inclined , and take his message to that ' scounthrel .

270750	270760	270761	270762	Mr. Pen	9776	" What a nice little artless creature that was , "
270775	270797	270800	270800	he	9776	" what a pretty natural manner she has ; how much pleasanter than the minauderies of the young ladies in the ballrooms "
270836	271089	271098	271098	himself	9780	" who could have thought that such a pretty rose could grow in a porter 's lodge , or bloom in that dismal old flower - pot of a Shepherd 's Inn ? So she learns to sing from old Bows ? If her singing voice is as sweet as her speaking voice , it must be pretty . I like those low voilees voices . ' What would you like me to call you ? ' indeed , poor little Fanny ! It went to my heart to adopt the grand air with her and tell her to call me , ' Sir . ' But we 'll have no nonsense of that sort - no Faust and Margaret business for me . That old Bows ! So he teaches her to sing , does he ? He 's a dear old fellow , old Bows : a gentleman in those old clothes : a philosopher , and with a kind heart , too . How good he was to me in the Fotheringay business . He , too , has had his griefs and his sorrows . I must cultivate old Bows . A man ought to see people of all sorts . I am getting tired of genteel society . Besides , there 's nobody in town . Yes , I 'll go and see Bows , and Costigan too ; what a rich character ! begad , I 'll study him , and put him into a book . "
271877	271882	271863	271863	She	986	" Mamma , mamma , "
272411	272417	272419	272420	the ladies	13951	" Oh , we know , "
272422	272474	272419	272420	the ladies	13951	" Sir F - - is Sir F. Clavering he 's often here : two or three times a week with the Captain . My little boy has been out for bill - stamps for him . O Lor ! I beg pardon , I should n't have mentioned no secrets , "
272491	272525	272475	272476	Mrs. Bolton	842	" But we know you to be a gentleman , Mr. Pendennis , for I 'm sure you have shown that you can beayve as such . Has n't Mr. Pendennis , Fanny ? "
272547	272560	272534	272534	She	986	" Oh , that he has , I 'm sure , Ma , "
273044	273049	273041	273041	Fanny	986	" Do n't bother ! "
273057	273075	273054	273054	Mamma	1205	" Git - long , Betsy - Jane , do now , and play in the court : "
273225	273237	273240	273240	Pen	799	" What ! Mr. Bows ? How d'you do , Bows ? "
273249	273266	273240	273240	Pen	799	" I was coming to see you , and was asking your address of these ladies . "
273267	273280	273281	273281	Bows	833	" You were coming to see me , were you , sir ? "
273298	273305	273306	273306	somebody	14677	" Plague on that old man ! "
273333	273341	273331	273331	Pen	799	" How d'ye do , Mr. Bows , "
273676	273686	273667	273667	his	9911	" You were coming to see me , sir , "
273691	273727	273667	273667	his	9911	" Wo n't you have the kindness to walk up to my chambers with me ? You do them a great honour , I am sure . They are rather high up ; but - - "
273728	273750	273751	273752	Mr. Pendennis	739	" Oh ! I live in a garret myself , and Shepherd 's Inn is twice as cheerful as Lamb Court , "
273756	273767	273751	273752	Mr. Pendennis	739	" I knew that you had third - floor apartments , "
273772	273811	273768	273769	Mr. Bows	833	" and was going to say - you will please not take my remark as discourteous - that the air up three pair of stairs is wholesomer for gentlemen , than the air of a porter 's lodge . "
273812	273815	273817	273817	Pen	799	" Sir ! "
273846	273859	273860	273860	You	799	" Will you permit me to choose my society without - - ? "
273880	273890	273868	273868	you	799	" Mr. Bows said , with his sad voice . "
273926	274018	273923	273924	each other	14083	" The old man pointed towards the door with a trembling finger , and a hat in the other hand , and in an attitude slightly theatrical ; so were his words when he spoke somewhat artificial , and chosen from the vocabulary which he had heard all his life from the painted lips of the orators before the stage - lamps . But he was not acting or masquerading , as Pen knew very well , though he was disposed to pooh - pooh the old fellow 's melodramatic airs . "
274024	274028	273923	273924	each other	14083	" he said , "
274075	274094	274096	274099	a nice young man	9919	" And he took her hand , pressed it , was pressed by it , and was gone . "
274105	274110	274115	274115	ma	2728	" cried Mrs. Bolton . "
274117	274121	274115	274115	ma	2728	" said Fanny . "
274142	274165	274133	274133	I	0	" Mrs. Bolton continued , looking through the window - curtain after Pen , as he went up the court with Bows , "
274207	274208	274201	274202	Mr. P.	1781	" "
274220	274224	274225	274225	He	9919	" Fanny said . "
274378	274992	274368	274368	she	1369	" Thus , and more to this purpose , Mrs. Bolton spoke , now peeping through the window - curtain , now cleaning the mugs and plates , and consigning them to their place in the corner cupboard ; and finishing her speech as she and Fanny shook out and folded up the dinner - cloth between them , and restored it to its drawer in the table . Although Costigan had once before been made pretty accurately to understand what Pen 's pecuniary means and expectations were , I suppose Cos had forgotten the information acquired at Chatteris years ago , or had been induced by his natural enthusiasm to exaggerate his friend 's income . He had described Fairoaks Park in the most glowing terms to Mrs. Bolton , on the preceding evening , as he was walking about with her during Pen 's little escapade with Fanny , had dilated upon the enormous wealth of Pen 's famous uncle , the Major , and shown an intimate acquaintance with Arthur 's funded and landed property . Very likely Mrs. Bolton , in her wisdom , had speculated upon these matters during the night ; and had had visions of Fanny driving in her carriage , like Mrs. Bolton 's old comrade , the dancer of Sadler 's Wells . In the last operation of table - cloth folding , these two foolish women , of necessity , came close together ; and as Fanny took the cloth and gave it the last fold , her mother put her finger under the young girl 's chin , and kissed her . Again the red signal flew out , and fluttered on Fanny 's cheek . What did it mean ? It was not alarm this time . It was pleasure which caused the poor little Fanny to blush so . Poor little Fanny ! What ? is love sin ? that it is so pleasant at the beginning , and so bitter at the end ? After the embrace , Mrs. Bolton thought proper to say that she was a - goin out upon business , and that Fanny must keep the lodge ; which Fanny , after a very faint objection indeed , consented to do . So Mrs. Bolton took her bonnet and market - basket , and departed ; and the instant she was gone , Fanny went and sae by the window which commanded Bows 's door , and never once took her eyes away from that quarter of Shepherd 's Inn . Betsy - Jane and Ameliar - Ann were buzzing in one corner of the place , and making believe to read out of a picture - book , which one of them held topsy - turvy . It was a grave and dreadful tract , of Mr. Bolton 's collection . Fanny did not hear her sisters prattling over it . She noticed nothing but Bows 's door . At last she gave a little shake , and her eyes lighted up . He had come out . He would pass the door again . But her poor little countenance fell in an instant more . Pendennis , indeed , came out ; but Bows followed after him . They passed under the archway together . He only took off his hat , and bowed as he looked in . He did not stop to speak . In three or four minutes - Fanny did not know how long , but she looked furiously at him when he came into the lodge - Bows returned alone , and entered into the porter 's room . "
275000	275006	274998	274998	dear	2626	" he said to Fanny . "
275012	275021	275007	275007	I	0	" Fanny said , with an angry toss . "
275039	275040	275036	275037	Mr. Bows	833	" "
275048	275058	275042	275042	I	0	" Bows said , with his usual melancholy bitterness . "
275099	276625	275089	275097	the other who can read them the next best	9940	" When the young ladies had undergone the examination through which Bows put them , they were rewarded with their gingerbread medals , and went off to discuss them in the court . Meanwhile Fanny took out some work , and pretended to busy herself with it , her mind being in great excitement and anger , as she plied her needle . Bows sate so that he could command the entrance from the lodge to the street . But the person whom , perhaps , he expected to see , never made his appearance again . And Mrs. Bolton came in from market , and found Mr. Bows in place of the person whom she had expected to see . The reader perhaps can guess what was his name ? The interview between Bows and his guest , when those two mounted to the apartment occupied by the former in common with the descendant of the Milesian kings , was not particularly satisfactory to either party . Pen was sulky . If Bows had anything on his mind , he did not care to deliver himself of his thoughts in the presence of Captain Costigan , who remained in the apartment during the whole of Pen 's visit ; having quitted his bedchamber , indeed , but a very few minutes before the arrival of that gentleman . We have witnessed the deshahille of Major Pendennis : will any man wish to be valet - de - chambre to our other hero , Costigan ? It would seem that the Captain , before issuing from his bedroom , scented himself with otto - of - whisky . A rich odour of that delicious perfume breathed from out him , as he held out the grasp of cordiality to his visitor . The hand which performed that grasp shook wofully : it was a wonder how it could hold the razor with which the poor gentleman daily operated on his chin . Bows 's room was as neat , on the other hand , as his comrade 's was disorderly . His humble wardrobe hung behind a curtain . His books and manuscript music were trimly arranged upon shelves . A lithographed portrait of Miss Fotheringay , as Mrs. Haller , with the actress 's sprawling signature at the corner , hung faithfully over the old gentleman 's bed . Lady Mirabel wrote much better than Miss Fotheringay had been able to do . Her Ladyship had laboured assiduously to acquire the art of penmanship since her marriage ; and , in a common note of invitation or acceptance , acquitted herself very genteelly . Bows loved the old handwriting best , though ; the fair artist 's earlier manner . He had but one specimen of the new style , a note in reply to a song composed and dedicated to Lady Mirabel , by her most humble servant Robert Bows ; and which document was treasured in his desk amongst his other state papers . He was teaching Fanny Bolton now to sing and to write , as he had taught Emily in former days . It was the nature of the man to attach himself to something . When Emily was torn from him he took a substitute : as a man looks out for a crutch when he loses a leg ; or lashes himself to a raft when he has suffered shipwreck . Latude had given his heart to a woman , no doubt , before he grew to be so fond of a mouse in the Bastille . There are people who in their youth have felt and inspired an heroic passion , and end by being happy in the caresses , or agitated by the illness of a poodle . But it was hard upon Bows , and grating to his feelings as a man and a sentimentalist , that he should find Pen again upon his track , and in pursuit of this little Fanny . Meanwhile , Costigan had not the least idea but that his company was perfectly welcome to Messrs. Pendennis and Bows , and that the visit of the former was intended for himself . He expressed himself greatly pleased with that mark of poloightness and promised , in his own mind , that he would repay that obligation at least - which was not the only debt which the Captain owed in life - by several visits to his young friend . He entertained him affably with news of the day , or rather of ten days previous ; for Pen , in his quality of Journalist , remembered to have seen some of the Captain 's opinions in the Sporting and Theatrical Newspaper , which was Costigan 's oracle . He stated that Sir Charles and Lady Mirabel were gone to Baden - Baden , and were most pressing in their invitations that he should join them there . Pen replied with great gravity , that he had heard that Baden was very pleasant , and the Grand Duke exceedingly hospitable to English . Costigan answered , that the laws of hospitalitee bekeam a Grand Juke ; that he sariously would think about visiting him ; and made some remarks upon the splendid festivities at Dublin Castle , when his Excellency the Earl of Portansherry held the Viceraygal Coort there , and of which he , Costigan , had been a humble but pleased spectator . And Pen - as he heard these oft - told well - remembered legends - recollected the time when he had given a sort of credence to them , and had a certain respect for the Captain . Emily and first love , and the little room at Chatteris , and the kind talk with Bows on the bridge , came back to him . He felt quite kindly disposed towards his two old friends ; and cordially shook the hands of both of them when he rose to go away . He had quite forgotten about little Fanny Bolton whilst the Captain was talking , and Pen himself was absorbed in other selfish meditations . He only remembered her again as Bows came hobbling down the stairs after him , bent evidently upon following him out of Shepherd 's Inn . Mr. Bows 's precaution was not a lucky one . The wrath of Mr. Arthur Pendennis rose at the poor old fellow 's feeble persecution . Confound him , what does he mean by dogging me ? thought Pen . And he burst out laughing when he was in the Strand and by himself , as he thought of the elder 's stratagem . It was not an honest laugh , Arthur Pendennis . Perhaps the thought struck Arthur himself , and he blushed at his own sense of humour . He went off to endeavour to banish the thoughts which occupied him , whatever those thoughts might be , and tried various places of amusement with but indifferent success . He struggled up the highest stairs of the Panorama ; but when he had arrived , panting at the height of the eminence , Care had come up with him , and was bearing him company . He went to the Club , and wrote a long letter home , exceedingly witty and sarcastic , and in which , if he did not say a single word about Vauxhall and Fanny Bolton , it was because he thought that subject , however interesting to himself , would not be very interesting to his mother and Laura . Nor could the novels or the library table fix his attention , nor the grave and respectable Jawkins the only man in town , who wished to engage him in conversation ; nor any of the amusements which he tried , after flying from Jawkins . He passed a Comic Theatre on his way home , and saw ' Stunning Farce , ' ' Roars of Laughter , ' ' Good Old English Fun and Frolic , ' placarded in vermilion letters on the gate . He went into the pit , and saw the lovely Mrs. Leary , as usual , in a man 's attire ; and that eminent buffo actor , Tom Horseman , dressed as a woman . Horseman 's travesty seemed to him a horrid and hideous degradation ; Mrs. Leary 's glances and ankles had not the least effect . He laughed again , and bitterly , to himself , as he thought of the effect which she had produced upon him , on the first night of his arrival in London , a short time - what a long long time ago ! CHAPTER L Or near the Temple Garden Fashion has long deserted the green and pretty Temple Garden , which in Shakespeare makes York and Lancaster to pluck the innocent white and red roses which became the badges of their bloody wars ; and the learned and pleasant writer of the Handbook of London tells us that "
276641	277642	277646	277646	Jove	1002	" in that smoky air . Not many of the present occupiers of the buildings round about the quarter know or care , very likely , whether or not roses grow there , or pass the old gate , except on their way to chambers . The attorneys ' clerks do n't carry flowers in their bags , or posies under their arms , as they run to the counsel 's chambers - the few lawyers who take constitutional walks think very little about York and Lancaster , especially since the railroad business is over . Only antiquarians and literary amateurs care to look at the gardens with much interest , and fancy good Sir Roger de Coverley and Mr. Spectator with his short face pacing up and down the road ; or dear Oliver Goldsmith in the summer - house , perhaps meditating about the next ' Citizen of the World , ' or the new suit that Mr. Filby , the tailor , is fashioning for him , or the dunning letter that Mr. Newbery has sent . Treading heavily on the gravel , and rolling majestically along in a snuff - coloured suit , and a wig that sadly wants the barber 's powder and irons , one sees the Great Doctor step up to him his Scotch lackey following at the lexicographer 's heels , a little the worse for port wine that they have been taking at the Mitre , and Mr. Johnson asks Mr. Goldsmith to come home and take a dish of tea with Miss Williams . Kind faith of Fancy ! Sir Roger and Mr. Spectator are as real to us now as the two doctors and the boozy and faithful Scotchman . The poetical figures live in our memory just as much as the real personages , - and as Mr. Arthur Pendennis was of a romantic and literary turn , by no means addicted to the legal pursuits common in the neighbourhood of the place , we may presume that he was cherishing some such poetical reflections as these , when , upon the evening after the events recorded in the last chapter , the young gentleman chose the Temple Gardens as a place for exercise and meditation . On the Sunday evening the Temple is commonly calm . The chambers are for the most part vacant : the great lawyers are giving grand dinner - parties at their houses in the Belgravian or Tyburnian districts ; the agreeable young barristers are absent , attending those parties , and paying their respects to Mr. Kewsy 's excellent claret , or Mr. Justice Ermine 's accomplished daughters the uninvited are partaking of the economic joint and the modest half - pint of wine at the Club , entertaining themselves , and the rest of the company in the Club - room , with Circuit jokes and points of wit and law . Nobody is in chambers at all , except poor Mr. Cockle , who is ill , and whose laundress is making him gruel ; or Mr. Toodle , who is an amateur of the flute , and whom you may hear piping solitary from his chambers in the second floor ; or young Tiger , the student , from whose open windows comes a great gush of cigar smoke , and at whose door are a quantity of dishes and covers , bearing the insignia of Dicks ' or the Cock . But stop ! Whither does Fancy lead us ? It is vacation time ; and with the exception of Pendennis , nobody is in Chambers at all . Perhaps it was solitude , then , which drove Pen into the garden ; for although he had never before passed the gate , and had looked rather carelessly at the pretty flower - beds , and the groups of pleased citizens sauntering over the trim lawn and the broad gravel - walks by the river , on this evening it happened , as we have said , that the young gentleman , who had dined alone at a tavern in the neighbourhood of the Temple , took a fancy , as he was returning home to his chambers , to take a little walk in the gardens , and enjoy the fresh evening air , and the sight of the shining Thames . After walking for a brief space , and looking at the many peaceful and happy groups round about him , he grew tired of the exercise , and betook himself to one of the summer - houses which flank either end of the main walk , and there modestly seated himself . What were his cogitations ? The evening was delightfully bright and calm ; the sky was cloudless ; the chimneys on the opposite bank were not smoking ; the wharfs warehouses looked rosy in the sunshine , and as clear as if they , too , had washed for the holiday . The steamers rushed rapidly up and down the stream , laden with holiday passengers . The bells of the multitudinous city churches were ringing to evening prayers - such peaceful Sabbath evenings as this Pen may have remembered in his early days , as he paced , with his arm round his mother 's waist , on the terrace before the lawn at home . The sun was lighting up the little Brawl , too , as well as the broad Thames , and sinking downwards majestically behind the Clavering elms , and the tower of the familiar village church . Was it thoughts of these , or the sunset merely , that caused the blush in the young man 's face ? He beat time on the bench , to the chorus of the bells without ; flicked the dust off his shining boots with his pocket - handkerchief , and starting up , stamped with his foot and said , "
277653	277738	277648	277648	I	0	" And with this resolution , which indicated that some struggle as to the propriety of remaining where he was , or of quitting the garden , had been going on in his mind , he stepped out of the summer - house . He nearly knocked down two little children , who did not indeed reach much higher than his knee , and were trotting along the gravel - walk , with their long blue shadows slanting towards the east . One cried out "
277741	277758	277648	277648	I	0	" the other began to laugh ; and with a knowing little infantile chuckle , said , "
277762	277933	277759	277760	Missa Pendennis	1805	" And Arthur , looking down , saw his two little friends of the day before , Mesdemoiselles Ameliar - Ann and Betsy - Jane . He blushed more than ever at seeing them , and seizing the one whom he had nearly upset , jumped her up into the air , and kissed her : at which sudden assault Ameliar - Ann began to cry in great alarm . This cry brought up instantly two ladies in clean collars and new ribbons , and grand shawls , namely : Mrs. Bolton in a rich scarlet Caledonian Cashmere , and a black silk dress , and Miss F. Bolton with a yellow scarf and a sweet sprigged muslin , and a parasol - quite the lady . Fanny did not say one single word : though ; her eyes flashed a welcome , and shone as bright - as bright as the most blazing windows in Paper Buildings . But Mrs. Bolton , after admonishing Betsy - Jane , said , "
277972	278390	277969	277970	Mr. Pendennis	739	" What do you mean by sniggering , Mesdames ? When young Croesus has been staying at a country - house , have you never , by any singular coincidence , been walking with your Fanny in the shrubberies ? Have you and your Fanny never happened to be listening to the band of the Heavies at Brighton , when young De Boots and Captain Padmore came clinking down the Pier ? Have you and your darling Frances never chanced to be visiting old widow Wheezy at the cottage on the common , when the young curate has stepped in with a tract adapted to the rheumatism ? Do you suppose that , if singular coincidences occur at the Hall , they do n't also happen at the Lodge ? It was a coincidence , no doubt : that was all . In the course of the conversation on the day previous , Mr. Pendennis had merely said , in the simplest way imaginable , and in reply to a question of Miss Bolton , that although some of the courts were gloomy , parts of the Temple were very cheerful and agreeable , especially the chambers looking on the river and around the gardens , and that the gardens were a very pleasant walk on Sunday evenings and frequented by a great number of people - and here , by the merest chance , all our acquaintances met together , just like so many people in genteel life . What could be more artless , good - natured , or natural ? Pen looked very grave , pompous , and dandified . He was unusually smart and brilliant in his costume . His white duck trousers and white hat , his neckcloth of many colours , his light waistcoat , gold chains , and shirt - studs , gave him the air of a prince of the blood at least . How his splendour became his figure ! Was anybody ever like him ? some one thought . He blushed - how his blushes became him ! the same individual said to herself . The children , on seeing him the day before , had been so struck with him , that after he had gone away they had been playing at him . And Ameliar - Ann , sticking her little chubby fingers into the arm - holes of her pinafore , as Pen was wo nt to do with his waistcoat , had said , "
278403	278465	278397	278397	I	0	" Fanny had laughed till she cried , and smothered her sister with kisses for that feat . How happy , too , she was to see Arthur embracing the child ! If Arthur was red , Fanny , on the contrary , was very worn and pale . Arthur remarked it , and asked kindly why she looked so fatigued . "
278472	278483	278484	278484	I	0	" said Fanny , and began to blush a little . "
278502	278508	278509	278509	You	0	" interposed the fond mother . "
278522	278528	278546	278547	Walter Lorraine	1646	" asked Pen , amused . "
278536	278540	278546	278547	Walter Lorraine	1646	" said Fanny . "
278543	278544	278546	278547	Walter Lorraine	1646	" "
278550	278555	278546	278547	Walter Lorraine	1646	" Fanny sighed out . "
278587	279075	279077	279077	she	9946	" How had Fanny discovered the novel of ' Walter Lorraine , ' and that Pen was the author ? This little person remembered every single word which Mr. Pendennis had spoken on the night previous , and how he wrote in books and newspapers . What books ? She was so eager to know , that she had almost a mind to be civil to old Bows , who was suffering under her displeasure since yesterday , but she determined first to make application to Costigan . She began by coaxing the Captain and smiling upon him in her most winning way , as she helped to arrange his dinner and set his humble apartment in order . She was sure his linen wanted mending and indeed the Captain 's linen - closet contained some curious specimens of manufactured flax and cotton . She would mend his shirts - all his shirts . What horrid holes - what funny holes ! She put her little face through one of them , and laughed at the old warrior in the most winning manner . She would have made a funny little picture looking through the holes . Then she daintily removed Costigan 's dinner things , tripping about the room as she had seen the dancers do at the play ; and she danced to the Captain 's cupboard , and produced his whisky - bottle , and mixed him a tumbler , and must taste a drop of it - a little drop ; and the Captain must sing her one of his songs , his dear songs , and teach it to her . And when he had sung an Irish melody in his rich quavering voice , fancying it was he who was fascinating the little siren , she put her little question about Arthur Pendennis and his novel , and having got an answer , cared for nothing more , but left the Captain at the piano about to sing her another song , and the dinner - tray on the passage , and the shirts on the chair , and ran downstairs quickening her pace as she sped . Captain Costigan , as he said , was not a litherary cyarkter , nor had he as yet found time to peruse his young friend 's ellygant perfaurumance , though he intended to teak an early opporchunitee of purchasing a cawpee of his work . But he knew the name of Pen 's novel from the fact that Messrs. Finucane , Bludyer , and other frequenters of the Back Kitchen , spoke of Mr. Pendennis and not all of them with great friendship ; for Bludyer called him a confounded coxcomb , and Hoolan wondered that Doolan did not kick him etc . by the sobriquet of Walter Lorraine , - and was hence enabled to give Fanny the information which she required . "
279087	279157	279077	279077	she	9946	" Mrs. Bolton said , - several liberies - and some ad it and it was bout , and some adn't it . And one of the liberies as ad it would n't let er ave it without a sovering : and she adn't one , and she came back a - cryin to me - did n't you , Fanny ? - and I gave her a sovering . "
279158	279186	279187	279187	Fanny	986	" And , oh , I was in such a fright lest any one should have come to the libery and took it while I was away , "
279196	279207	279187	279187	Fanny	986	" And , oh , I do like it so ! "
279223	279229	279230	279230	he	739	" Do you like it ? "
279233	279288	279230	279230	he	739	" If you will come up to my chambers I will - No , I will bring you one - no , I will send you one . Good night . Thank you , Fanny . God bless you . I must n't stay with you . Good - bye , good - bye . "
279333	279340	279341	279341	he	739	" Dear , dear little thing , "
279345	279391	279341	279341	he	739	" darling little Fanny ! You are worth them all . I wish to heaven Shandon was back . I 'd go home to my mother . I must n't see her . I wo n't . I wo n't , so help me - - "
279426	279434	279436	279437	Mr. Bows	833	" Your very umble servant , sir , "
279453	279461	279462	279462	Arthur	739	" I wish you a good day , "
279466	279495	279462	279462	Arthur	739	" Do n't let me detain you , or give you the trouble to follow me again . I am in a hurry , sir . Good evening . "
279508	279513	279515	279517	the old gentleman	15207	" Where are they ? "
279519	279572	279515	279517	the old gentleman	15207	" You know whom I mean . They 're not in your rooms , sir , are they ? They told Bolton they were going to church at the Temple , they were n't there . They are in your chambers : they must n't stay in your chambers , Mr. Pendennis . "
279573	279579	279582	279582	Pendennis	739	" Damn it , sir ! "
279586	279610	279582	279582	Pendennis	739	" Come and see if they are in my chambers : here 's the court and the door - come in and see . "
279810	279831	279832	279832	he	833	" Will you like to look in the bedrooms , Mr. Bows , and see if my victims are there ? "
279836	279857	279832	279832	he	833	" or whether I have made away with the little girls , and hid them in the coal - hole ? "
279858	279867	279868	279869	the other	14365	" Your word is sufficient , Mr. Pendennis , "
279876	279905	279868	279869	the other	14365	" You say they are not here , and I know they are not . And I hope they never have been here , and never will come . "
279906	279925	279926	279926	Arthur	739	" Upon my word , sir , you are very good , to choose my acquaintances for me , "
279934	280011	279926	279926	Arthur	739	" and to suppose that anybody would be the worse for my society . I remember you , and owe you kindness from old times , Mr. Bows ; or I should speak more angrily than I do , about a very intolerable sort of persecution to which you seem inclined to subject me . You followed me out of your Inn yesterday , as if you wanted to watch that I should n't steal something . "
280041	280059	280060	280060	Bows	833	" I do think you came to steal something , as you say the words , sir , "
280063	280318	280319	280319	Bows	833	" Do you mean to say that you came to pay a visit to poor old Bows , the fiddler ; or to Mrs. Bolton , at the porter 's lodge ? O fie ! Such a fine gentleman as Arthur Pendennis , Esquire , does n't condescend to walk up to my garret , or to sit in a laundress 's kitchen , but for reasons of his own . And my belief is that you came to steal a pretty girl 's heart away , and to ruin it , and to spurn it afterwards , Mr. Arthur Pendennis . That 's what the world makes of you young dandies , you gentlemen of fashion , you high and mighty aristocrats that trample upon the people . It 's sport to you , but what is it to the poor , think you ; the toys of your pleasures , whom you play with and whom you fling into the streets when you are tired ? I know your order , sir . I know your selfishness , and your arrogance , and your pride . What does it matter to my lord , that the poor man 's daughter is made miserable , and her family brought to shame ? You must have your pleasures , and the people of course must pay for them . What are we made for , but for that ? It 's the way with you all - the way with you all , sir . "
280377	280385	280386	280386	he	739	" Yes , I am an aristocrat , "
280389	280569	280386	280386	he	739	" in a palace up three pair of stairs , with a carpet nearly as handsome as yours , Mr. Bows . My life is passed in grinding the people , is it ? - in ruining virgins and robbing the poor ? My good sir , this is very well in a comedy , where Job Thornberry slaps his breast , and asks my Lord how dare he trample on an honest man and poke out an Englishman 's fireside ; but in real life , Mr. Bows , to a man who has to work for his bread as much as you do - how can you talk about aristocrats tyrannising over the people ? Have I ever done you a wrong ? or assumed airs of superiority over you ? Did you not have an early regard for me - in days when we were both of us romantic young fellows , Mr. Bows ? Come , do n't be angry with me now , and let us be as good friends as we were before . "
280570	280577	280371	280371	he	739	" Those days were very different , "
280582	280622	280371	280371	he	739	" and Mr. Arthur Pendennis was an honest , impetuous young fellow then ; rather selfish and conceited , perhaps , but honest . He liked you then , because you were ready to ruin yourself for a woman . "
280623	280629	280630	280630	Arthur	739	" And now , sir ? "
280633	280651	280652	280652	Bows	833	" And now times are changed , and you want a woman to ruin herself for you , "
280655	280794	280795	280797	The old man	14049	" I know this child , sir . I 've always said this lot was hanging over her . She has heated her little brain with novels , until her whole thoughts are about love and lovers , and she scarcely sees that she treads on a kitchen floor . I have taught the little thing . She is full of many talents and winning ways , I grant you . I am fond of the girl , sir . I 'm a lonely old man ; I lead a life that I do n't like , among boon companions , who make me melancholy . I have but this child that I care for . Have pity upon me , and do n't take her away from me , Mr. Pendennis - do n't take her away . "
280825	280828	280830	280830	he	14049	" Indeed , "
280834	280885	280830	280830	he	14049	" you do me a wrong if you fancy I intend one to poor little Fanny . I never saw her till Friday night . It was the merest chance that our friend Costigan threw her into my way . I have no intentions regarding her - that is - - "
280886	280948	280949	280949	Bows	833	" That is , you know very well that she is a foolish girl , and her mother a foolish woman , - that is , you meet her in the Temple Gardens , and of course without previous concert , - that is , that when I found her yesterday reading the book you 've wrote , she scorned me , "
280952	281181	280949	280949	Bows	833	" What am I good for but to be laughed at ? a deformed old fellow like me ; an old fiddler , that wears a threadbare coat , and gets his bread by playing tunes at an ale - house ? You are a fine gentleman , you are . You wear scent in your handkerchief , and a ring on your finger . You go to dine with great people . Who ever gives a crust to old Bows ? And yet I might have been as good a man as the best of you . I might have been a man of genius , if I had had the chance ; ay , and have lived with the master - spirits of the land . But everything hads ailed with me . I 'd ambition once , and wrote plays , poems , music - nobody would give me a hearing . I never loved a woman , but she laughed at me ; and here I am in my old age alone - alone ! Do n't take this girl from me , Mr. Pendennis , I say again . Leave her with me a little longer . She was like a child to me till yesterday . Why did you step in , and made her to mock my deformity and old age ? "
281182	281192	281193	281193	Arthur	739	" I am guiltless of that , at least , "
281202	281272	281273	281273	he	739	" Upon my word of honour , I wish I had never seen the girl . My calling is not seduction , Mr. Bows . I did not imagine that I had made an impression on poor Fanny , until - until to - night . And then , sir , I was sorry , and was flying from my temptation , as you came upon me . And , "
281305	281378	281302	281302	his	739	" I do not mind telling you , sir , that on this Sabbath evening , as the church bells were ringing , I thought of my own home , and of women angelically pure and good , who dwell there ; and I was running hither as I met you , that I might avoid the danger which beset me , and ask strength of God Almighty to do my duty . "
281498	281504	281506	281507	Mr. Bows	833	" Amen to that prayer , "
281999	282005	281986	281986	he	10006	" go it a bit , "
282707	282710	282712	282712	he	896	" chaff , "
282738	282742	282734	282734	Galen	1814	" four stouts , "
282782	282792	282793	282793	he	799	" Jolly night at Vauxhall - was n't it ? "
282804	282812	282793	282793	he	799	" I 'm glad you liked it , "
282821	282853	282855	282857	the fascinating student	10064	" I was dev'lish cut - uncommon - been dining with some chaps at Greenwich . That was a pretty bit of muslin hanging on your arm - who was she ? "
282867	282880	282881	282881	he	799	" Have I asked you any questions about yourself , Mr. Huxter ? "
282884	282904	282906	282906	Pen	799	" I did n't mean any offence - beg pardon - hang it , you cut up quite savage , "
282911	282924	282925	282925	Pen	799	" Do you remember what took place between us the other night ? "
282932	282953	282925	282925	Pen	799	" You forget ? Very probably . You were tipsy , as you observed just now , and very rude . "
282954	282965	282966	282966	Huxter	896	" Hang it , sir , I asked your pardon , "
282972	283063	283064	283064	He	896	" You did certainly , and it was granted with all my heart . I am sure . But if you recollect , I begged that you would have the goodness to omit me from the list of your acquaintance for the future ; and when we met in public , that you would not take the trouble to recognise me . Will you please to remember this , hereafter ? and as the song is beginning , permit me to leave you to the unrestrained enjoyment of the music . "
283119	283132	283109	283113	the president of the room	10067	" Silence , gentlemen ; do have silence for the Body Snatcher ! "
284156	284160	284161	284161	she	697	" The cowards , "
284180	284181	284173	284173	mother	2244	" "
284194	284200	284192	284192	Laura	799	" cried out Helen fiercely . "
284307	284476	284300	284300	you	934	" And bidding her daughter and her servants keep away from her , she ran down the road to Clavering . Doctor Portman , glancing over the letter , thought he knew the handwriting , and , of course , was already acquainted with the charge made against poor Pen . Against his own conscience , perhaps for the worthy Doctor , like most of us , had a considerable natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavourable to his neighbours , he strove to console Helen ; he pointed out that the slander came from an anonymous quarter , and therefore must be the work of a rascal ; that the charge might not be true - was not true , most likely - at least , that Pen must be heard before he was condemned ; that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime , etc . etc . Helen at once saw through his feint of objection and denial . "
284484	284489	284490	284490	you	10131	" she said , - "
284706	286451	284699	284700	dear friend	10144	" Helen could say no more . She fell back and fainted . She was carried to a bed in the house of the pitying Doctor , and the surgeon was called to attend her . She lay all night in an alarming state . Laura came to her , or to the rectory rather ; for she would not see Laura . And Doctor Portman , still beseeching her to be tranquil , and growing bolder and more confident of Arthur 's innocence as he witnessed the terrible grief of the poor mother , wrote a letter to Pen warning him of the rumours that were against him and earnestly praying that he would break off and repent of a connexion so fatal to his best interests and his soul 's welfare . And Laura ? - was her heart not wrung by the thought of Arthur 's crime and Helen 's estrangement ? Was it not a bitter blow for the innocent girl to think that at one stroke she should lose all the love which she cared for in the world ? CHAPTER LII Which had very nearly been the last of the Story Doctor Portman 's letter was sent off to its destination in London , and the worthy clergyman endeavoured to soothe down Mrs. Pendennis into some state of composure until an answer should arrive , which the Doctor tried to think , or at any rate persisted in saying , would be satisfactory as regarded the morality of Mr. Pen . At least Helen 's wisdom of moving upon London and appearing in person to warn her son of his wickedness , was impracticable for a day or two . The apothecary forbade her moving even so far as Fairoaks for the first day , and it was not until the subsequent morning that she found herself again back on her sofa at home , with the faithful , though silent , Laura nursing at her side . Unluckily for himself and all parties , Pen never read that homily which Doctor Portman addressed to him , until many weeks after the epistle had been composed ; and day after day the widow waited for her son 's reply to the charges against him ; her own illness increasing with every day 's delay . It was a hard task for Laura to bear the anxiety ; to witness her dearest friend 's suffering ; worst of all , to support Helen 's estrangement , and the pain caused to her by that averted affection . But it was the custom of this young lady to the utmost of her power , and by means of that gracious assistance which Heaven awarded to her pure and constant prayers , to do her duty . And ; as that duty was performed quite noiselessly , - while the supplications , which endowed her with the requisite strength for fulfilling it , also took place in her own chamber , away from all mortal sight , - we , too , must be perforce silent about these virtues of hers , which no more bear public talking about , than a flower will bear to bloom in a ballroom . This only we will say - that a good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms under heaven ; and that we look with love and wonder upon its silent grace , its pure fragrance , its delicate bloom of beauty . Sweet and beautiful ! - the fairest and the most spotless ! - is it not pity to see them bowed down or devoured by Grief or Death inexorable - wasting in disease - pining with long pain - or cut off by sudden fate in their prime ? We may deserve grief - but why should these be unhappy ? - except that we know that Heaven chastens those whom it loves best ; being pleased , by repeated trials , to make these pure spirits more pure . So Pen never got the letter , although it was duly posted and faithfully discharged by the postman into his letter - box in Lamb Court , and thence carried by the laundress to his writing - table with the rest of his lordship 's correspondence ; into which room , have we not seen a picture of him , entering from his little bedroom adjoining , as Mrs. Flanagan , his laundress , was in the act of drinking his gin ? Those kind readers who have watched Mr. Arthur 's career hitherto , and have made , as they naturally would do , observations upon the moral character and peculiarities of their acquaintance , have probably discovered by this time what was the prevailing fault in Mr. Pen 's disposition , and who was that greatest enemy , artfully indicated in the title - page , with whom he had to contend . Not a few of us , my beloved public , have the very same rascal to contend with : a scoundrel who takes every opportunity of bringing us into mischief , of plunging us into quarrels , of leading us into idleness and unprofitable company , and what not . In a word , Pen 's greatest enemy was himself : and as he had been pampering , and coaxing , and indulging that individual all his life , the rogue grew insolent , as all spoiled servants will be ; and at the slightest attempt to coerce him , or make him do that which was unpleasant to him , became frantically rude and unruly . A person who is used to making sacrifices - Laura , for instance , who had got such a habit of giving up her own pleasure for others - can do the business quite easily ; but Pen , unaccustomed as he was to any sort of self - denial , suffered woundily when called on to pay his share , and savagely grumbled at being obliged to forgo anything he liked . He had resolved in his mighty mind then that he would not see Fanny ; and he would n't . He tried to drive the thoughts of that fascinating little person out of his head , by constant occupation , by exercise , by dissipation and society . He worked then too much ; he walked and rode too much ; he ate , drank , and smoked too much : nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little Fanny 's image out of his inflamed brain , and at the end of a week of this discipline and self - denial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever . Let the reader who has never had a fever in chambers pity the wretch who is bound to undergo that calamity . A committee of marriageable ladies , or of any Christian persons interested in the propagation of the domestic virtues , should employ a Cruikshank or a Leech , or some other kindly expositor of the follies of the day , to make a series of designs representing the horrors of a bachelor 's life in chambers , and leading the beholder to think of better things , and a more wholesome condition . What can be more uncomfortable than the bachelor 's lonely breakfast ? - with the black kettle in the dreary fire in midsummer ; or , worse still , with the fire gone out at Christmas , half an hour after the laundress has quitted the sitting - room ? Into this solitude the owner enters shivering , and has to commence his day by hunting for coals and wood ; and before he begins the work of a student , has to discharge the duties of a housemaid , vice Mrs. Flanagan , who is absent without leave . Or , again , what can form a finer subject for the classical designer than the bachelor 's shirt - that garment which he wants to assume just at dinner - time , and which he finds without any buttons to fasten it ? Then there is the bachelor 's return to chambers , after a merry Christmas holiday , spent in a cosy country - house , full of pretty faces , and kind welcomes and regrets . He leaves his portmanteau at the barber 's in the Court : he lights his dismal old candle at the sputtering little lamp on the stair : he enters the blank familiar room , where the only tokens to greet him , that show any interest in his personal welfare , are the Christmas bills , which are lying in wait for him , amiably spread out on his reading - table . Add to these scenes an appalling picture of bachelor 's illness , and the rents in the Temple will begin to fall from the day of the publication of the dismal diorama . To be well in chambers is melancholy , and lonely and selfish enough ; but to be ill in chambers - to pass long nights of pain and watchfulness - to long for the morning and the laundress - to serve yourself your own medicine by your own watch - to have no other companion for long hours but your own sickening fancies and fevered thoughts : no kind hand to give you drink if you are thirsty , or to smooth the hot pillow that crumples under you , - this , indeed , is a fate so dismal and tragic , that we shall not enlarge upon its horrors , and shall only heartily pity those bachelors in the Temple , who brave it every day . This lot befell Arthur Pendennis after the various excesses which we have mentioned , and to which he had subjected his unfortunate brains . One night he went to bed ill , and the next day awoke worse . His only visitor that day , besides the laundress , was the Printer 's Devil , from the Pall Mall Gazette office , whom the writer endeavoured , as best he could , to satisfy . His exertions to complete his work rendered his fever the greater : he could only furnish a part of the quantity of "
286453	286650	287479	287479	you	0	" usually supplied by him ; and Shandon being absent , and Warrington not in London to give a help , the political and editorial columns of the Gazette looked very blank indeed ; nor did the sub - editor know how to fill them . Mr. Finucane rushed up to Pen 's chambers , and found that gentleman so exceedingly unwell , that the good - natured Irishman set to work to supply his place , if possible , and produced a series of political and critical compositions , such as no doubt greatly edified the readers of the periodical in which he and Pen were concerned . Allusions to the greatness of Ireland , and the genius and virtue of the inhabitants of that injured country , flowed magnificently from Finucane 's pen ; and Shandon , the Chief of the paper , who was enjoying himself placidly at Boulogne - sur - Mer , looking over the columns of the journal , which was forwarded to him , instantly recognised the hand of the great Sub - editor , and said , laughing , as he flung over the paper to his wife , "
286666	287188	286661	286661	Jack	1404	" Indeed , Jack was a warm friend , and a gallant partisan , and when he had the pen in hand , seldom let slip an opportunity of letting the world know that Rafferty was the greatest painter in Europe , and wondering at the petty jealousy of the Academy , which refused to make him an R.A. : of stating that it was generally reported at the West End , that Mr. Rooney , M.P. , was appointed Governor of Barataria ; or of introducing into the subject in hand , whatever it might be , a compliment to the Round Towers , or the Giant 's Causeway . And besides doing Pen 's work for him , to the best of his ability , his kind - hearted comrade offered to forgo his Saturday 's and Sunday 's holiday , and pass those days of holiday and rest as nurse - tender to Arthur , who , however , insisted , that the other should not forgo his pleasure , and thankfully assured him that he could bear best his malady alone . Taking his supper at the Back Kitchen on the Friday night , after having achieved the work of the paper , Finucane informed Captain Costigan of the illness of their young friend in the Temple ; and remembering the fact two days afterwards , the Captain went to Lamb Court and paid a visit to the invalid on Sunday afternoon . He found Mrs. Flanagan , the laundress , in tears in the sitting - room , and got a bad report of the poor dear young gentleman within . Pen 's condition had so much alarmed her , that she was obliged to have recourse to the stimulus of brandy to enable her to support the grief which his illness occasioned . As she hung about his bed , and endeavoured to minister to him , her attentions became intolerable to the invalid , and he begged her peevishly not to come near him . Hence the laundress 's tears and redoubled grief , and renewed application to the bottle , which she was accustomed to use as an anodyne . The Captain rated the woman soundly for her intemperance , and pointed out to her the fatal consequences which must ensue if she persisted in her imprudent courses . Pen , who was by this time in a very fevered state , yet was greatly pleased to receive Costigan 's visit . He heard the ell - known voice in his sitting - room , as he lay in the bedroom within , and called the Captain eagerly to him , and thanked him for coming , and begged him to take a chair and talk to him . The Captain felt the young man 's pulse with great gravity - his own tremulous and clammy hand growing steady for the instant while his finger pressed Arthur 's throbbing vein - the pulse was beating very fiercely - Pen 's face was haggard and hot - his eyes were bloodshot and gloomy ; his "
287191	287463	286661	286661	Jack	1404	" as the Captain pronounced the word , afterwards giving a description of his condition , had not been shaved for nearly a week . Pen made his visitor sit down , and , tossing and turning in his comfortless bed , began to try and talk to the Captain in a lively manner , about the Back Kitchen , about Vauxhall and when they should go again , and about Fanny - how was little Fanny ? Indeed how was she ? We know how she went home very sadly on the previous Sunday evening , after she had seen Arthur light his lamp in his chambers , whilst he was having his interview with Bows . Bows came back to his own rooms presently , passing by the lodge door , and looking into Mrs. Bolton 's , according to his wo nt , as he passed , but with a very melancholy face . She had another weary night that night . Her restlessness wakened her little bedfellows more than once . She dare n't read more of ' Walter Lorraine : ' Father was at home , and would suffer no light . She kept the book under her pillow , and felt for it in the night . She had only just got to sleep , when the children began to stir with the morning , almost as early as the birds . Though she was very angry with Bows , she went to his room at her accustomed hour in the day , and there the good - hearted musician began to talk to her . "

287486	287498	287483	287483	you	0	" Fanny answered , looking fiercely at the melancholy old gentleman . "

287639	287692	287627	287627	I	0	" cried Miss Fanny ; and clenched her little hand , and paced up and down the room . Bows noted , watched , and followed the ardent little creature with admiration and gloomy sympathy . Her cheeks flushed , her frame trembled ; her eyes beamed love , anger , defiance . "
287702	287706	287693	287693	You	0	" she said ; "

287940	287963	287921	287923	An honest girl	10167	" Fanny 's emotion , which but now had been that of defiance and anger , here turned to dismay and supplication . "
287973	287977	287971	287971	Bows	833	" she said . "
288109	288128	288094	288094	Ma	1778	" - here she broke out with that usual , unanswerable female argument of tears - and cried , "
288154	288155	288156	288156	He	14076	" "
288164	288327	288156	288156	He	14076	" Bows said ; and Fanny asked through her sobs , Why , why should he wish he had never seen her ? Had she ever done him any harm ? Oh , she would perish rather than do him any harm . Whereupon the musician informed her of the conversation of the day previous , showed her that Pen could not and must not think of her as a wife fitting for him , and that she , as she valued her honest reputation , must strive too to forget him . And Fanny , leaving the musician , convinced , but still of the same mind , and promising that she would avoid the danger which menaced her , went back to the porter 's lodge , and told her mother all . She talked of her love for Arthur , and bewailed , in her artless manner , the inequality of their condition , that set barriers between them . "
288337	288341	288344	288344	Ma	1778	" Fanny said ; "
288661	288701	288702	288702	You	10197	" The girl 's head fell on her mother 's shoulder , as she spoke , and she gave way to a plentiful outpouring of girlish tears , to which the matron , of course , joined her own . "
288713	288717	288711	288711	Fanny	986	" she said . "
288734	288735	288728	288732	a horrid , wicked man	10198	" "
288744	288748	288742	288742	Mother	1823	" Fanny replied . "
288866	288867	288868	288868	You	0	" "
288887	288892	288877	288877	you	0	" Mrs. Bolton said . "
289021	289071	289005	289005	you	10211	" At this point of the conversation Mr. Bolton entered the lodge for his evening meal . At the father 's appearance , the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly . Mrs. Bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertaker 's aide - de - camp , and said , "
289137	290331	289125	289125	I	0	" And she squeezed her daughter 's hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy ; and Fanny 's tears were dried up likewise ; and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise , and with which weapons of defence nature endows them , the traces of her emotion disappeared ; and she went and took her work , and sate in the corner so demure and quiet , that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her . Thus , as if fate seemed determined to inflame and increase the poor child 's malady and passion , all circumstances and all parties round about her urged it on . Her mother encouraged and applauded it ; and the very words which Bows used in endeavouring to repress her flame only augmented this unlucky fever . Pen was not wicked and a seducer : Pen was high - minded in wishing to avoid her . Pen loved her : the good and the great , the magnificent youth , with the chains of gold and the scented auburn hair ! And so he did : or so he would have loved her five years back perhaps , before the world had hardened the ardent and reckless boy - before he was ashamed of a foolish and imprudent passion , and strangled it as poor women do their illicit children , not on account of the crime , but of the shame , and from dread that the finger of the world should point to them . What respectable person in the world will not say he was quite right to avoid a marriage with an ill - educated person of low degree , whose relations a gentleman could not well acknowledge , and whose manners would not become her new station ? - and what philosopher would not tell him that the best thing to do with these little passions if they spring up , is to get rid of them , and let them pass over and cure them : that no man dies about a woman or vice versa : and that one or the other having found the impossibility of gratifying his or her desire in the particular instance , must make the best of matters , forget each other , look out elsewhere , and choose again ? And yet , perhaps , there may be something said on the other side . Perhaps Bows was right in admiring that passion of Pen 's , blind and unreasoning as it was , that made him ready to stake his all for his love ; perhaps if self - sacrifice is a laudable virtue , mere worldly self - sacrifice is not very much to be praised ; - in fine , let this be a reserved point to be settled by the individual moralist who chooses to debate it . So much is certain , that with the experience of the world which Mr. Pen now had , he would have laughed at and scouted the idea of marrying a penniless girl out of a kitchen . And this point being fixed in his mind , he was but doing his duty as an honest man , in crushing any unlucky fondness which he might feel towards poor little Fanny . So she waited and waited in hopes that Arthur would come . She waited for a whole week , and it was at the end of that time that the poor little creature heard from Costigan of the illness under which Arthur was suffering . It chanced on that very evening after Costigan had visited Pen , that Arthur 's uncle the excellent Major arrived in town from Buxton , where his health had been mended , and sent his valet Morgan to make inquiries for Arthur , and to request that gentleman to breakfast with the Major the next morning . The Major was merely passing through London on his way to the Marquis of Steyne 's house of Stillbrook , where he was engaged to shoot partridges . Morgan came back to his master with a very long face . He had seen Mr. Arthur ; Mr. Arthur was very bad indeed ; Mr. Arthur was in bed with a fever . A doctor ought to be sent to him ; and Morgan thought his case most alarming . Gracious goodness ! this was sad news indeed . He had hoped that Arthur could come down to Stillbrook : he had arranged that he should go , and procured an invitation for his nephew from Lord Steyne . He must go himself ; he could n't throw Lord Steyne over : the fever might be catching : it might be measles : he had never himself had the measles ; they were dangerous when contracted at his age . Was anybody with Mr. Arthur ? Morgan said there was somebody a - nussing of Mr. Arthur . The Major then asked , had his nephew taken any advice ? Morgan said he had asked that question , and had been told that Mr. Pendennis had had no doctor . Morgan 's master was sincerely vexed at hearing of Arthur 's calamity . He would have gone to him , but what good could it do Arthur that he , the Major , should catch a fever ? His own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to anybody but himself . But the young man must have advice - the best advice ; and Morgan was straightway despatched with a note from Major Pendennis to his friend Doctor Goodenough , who by good luck happened to be in London and at home , and who quitted his dinner instantly , and whose carriage was in half an hour in Upper Temple Lane , near Pen 's chambers . The Major had asked the kind - hearted physician to bring him news of his nephew at the Club where he himself was dining , and in the course of the night the Doctor made his appearance . The affair was very serious : the patient was in a high fever : he had had Pen bled instantly : and would see him the first thing in the morning . The Major went disconsolate to bed with this unfortunate news . When Goodenough came to see him according to his promise the next day , the Doctor had to listen for a quarter of an hour to an account of the Major 's own maladies , before the latter had leisure to hear about Arthur . He had had a very bad night - his - his nurse said : at one hour he had been delirious . It might end badly : his mother had better be sent for immediately . The Major wrote the letter to Mrs. Pendennis with the greatest alacrity , and at the same time with the most polite precautions . As for going himself to the lad , in his state it was impossible . "
290345	290500	290333	290333	I	0	" he asked . The Doctor , with a peculiar laugh , said , No : he did n't think the Major could be of any use : that his own precious health required the most delicate treatment , and that he had best go into the country and stay : that he himself would take care to see the patient twice a day , and do all in his power for him . The Major declared upon his honour , that if he could be of any use he would rush to Pen 's chambers . As it was , Morgan should go and see that everything was right . The Doctor must write to him by every post to Stillbrook : it was but forty miles distant from London , and if anything happened he would come up at any sacrifice . Major Pendennis transacted his benevolence by deputy and by post . "
290507	290512	290513	290513	Gad	945	" as he said ? "
290586	290944	290947	290948	a bailiff	8570	" Thus it was the old gentleman tried to satisfy his conscience and he went his way that day to Stillbrook by railway for railways have sprung up in the course of this narrative , though they have not quite penetrated into Pen 's country yet , and made his appearance in his usual trim order and curly wig , at the dinner - table of the Marquis of Steyne . But we must do the Major the justice to say , that he was very unhappy and gloomy in demeanour . Wagg and Wenham rallied him about his low spirits ; asked whether he was crossed in love ? and otherwise diverted themselves at his expense . He lost his money at whist after dinner , and actually trumped his partner 's highest spade . And the thoughts of the suffering boy , of whom he was proud , and whom he loved after his manner , kept the old fellow awake half through the night , and made him feverish and uneasy . On the morrow he received a note in a handwriting which he did not know : it was that of Mr. Bows , indeed , saying that Mr. Arthur Pendennis had had a tolerable night ; and that as Dr. Goodenough had stated that the Major desired to be informed of his nephew 's health , he , R. B. , had sent him the news per rail . The next day he was going out shooting , about noon , with some of the gentlemen staying at Lord Steyne 's house ; and the company , waiting for the carriages , were assembled on the terrace in front of the house , when a fly drove up from the neighbouring station , and a grey - headed , rather shabby old gentleman jumped out , and asked for Major Pendennis . It was Mr. Bows . He took the Major aside and spoke to him ; most of the gentlemen round about saw that something serious had happened , from the alarmed look of the Major 's face . Wagg said , "
290956	290964	290965	290965	Hullo	974	" but nobody laughed at the pleasantry . "
290974	290985	290947	290948	a bailiff	8570	" cried Lord Steyne , with his strident voice ; - "
290989	290990	290947	290948	a bailiff	8570	" "
291003	291021	290947	290948	a bailiff	8570	" said the Major , and burst into a sob - the old man was quite overcome . "
291036	291067	291068	291068	You	693	" Mr. Bows said , in a low voice . A britzka came up at this moment as the three men were speaking . The Peer looked at his watch . "
291097	291200	291094	291094	you	2261	" The carriage drove off swiftly with Pendennis and his companions , and let us trust that the oath will be pardoned to the Marquis of Steyne . The Major drove rapidly from the station to the Temple , and found a travelling carriage already before him , and blocking up the narrow Temple Lane . Two ladies got out of it , and were asking their way of the porters ; the Major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage , and saw the worn - out crest of the Eagle looking at the Sun , and the motto , "
291205	291454	291455	291455	I	0	" painted beneath . It was his brother 's old carriage , built many , many years ago . It was Helen and Laura that were asking their way to Pen 's room . He ran up to them ; hastily clasped his sister 's arm and kissed her hand ; and the three entered into Lamb Court , and mounted the long gloomy stair . They knocked very gently at the door , on which Arthur 's name was written , and it was opened by Fanny Bolton . CHAPTER LIII A critical Chapter As Fanny saw the two ladies and the anxious countenance of the eider , who regarded her with a look of inscrutable alarm and terror , the poor girl at once knew that Pen 's mother was before her ; there was a resemblance between the widow 's haggard eyes and Arthur 's as he tossed in his bed in fever . Fanny looked wistfully at Mrs. Pendennis and at Laura afterwards ; there was no more expression in the latter 's face than if it had been a mass of stone . Hard - heartedness and gloom dwelt on the figures of both the new - comers ; neither showed any the faintest gleam of mercy or sympathy for Fanny . She looked desperately from them to the Major behind them . Old Pendennis dropped his eyelids , looking up ever so stealthily from under them at Arthur 's poor little nurse . "
291469	291498	291500	291500	you	0	" Fanny said , trembling in every limb as she spoke ; and as pale as Laura , whose sad menacing face looked over Mrs. Pendennis 's shoulder . "
291504	291509	291500	291500	you	0	" Mrs. Pendennis said . "
291530	291531	291524	291525	his mother	13927	" "
291551	291556	291557	291557	I	0	" cried out Fanny . "
291565	291594	291595	291595	He	16145	" The widow , whose face had been hopelessly cruel and ruthless , here started back with a gasp and a little cry , which she speedily stifled . "
291602	291686	291595	291595	He	16145	" Fanny said , trembling very much , and with chattering teeth . A horrid shriek of laughter came out of Pen 's room , whereof the door was open ; and , after several shouts , the poor wretch began to sing a college drinking - song , and then to hurray and to shout as if he was in the midst of a wine - party , and to thump with his fist against the wainscot . He was quite delirious . "
291695	291699	291687	291687	He	16145	" Fanny said . "
291723	291861	291864	291864	nurse	22289	" And the widow hastily pushed by little Fanny , and through the dark passage which led into Pen 's sitting - room . Laura sailed by Fanny , too , without a word ; and Major Pendennis followed them . Fanny sat down on a bench in the passage , and cried , and prayed as well as she could . She would have died for him ; and they hated her . They had not a word of thanks or kindness for her , the fine ladies . She sate there in the passage , she did not know how long . They never came out to speak to her . She sate there until Doctor Goodenough came to pay his second visit that day ; he found the poor little thing at the door . "
291871	291879	291868	291869	your patient	10239	" asked the good - natured Doctor . "
291886	291887	291868	291869	your patient	10239	" "
291897	291901	291893	291893	They	10240	" Fanny answered . "
291907	291917	291918	291918	You	22289	" Fanny nodded her head and did n't speak . "
291930	291935	291923	291923	yourself	22289	" said the Doctor . "
291948	291949	291923	291923	yourself	22289	" "
291976	292025	291968	291968	I	0	" the little girl said ; and as she spoke she fell down on her knees and clasped hold of the Doctor 's hand in such an agony that to see her melted the kind physician 's heart , and caused a mist to come over his spectacles . "
292058	292059	292060	292060	They	10244	" "
292087	292594	292080	292080	I	0	" Fanny said . On which the Doctor called her a stupid little thing ; put her down upon the bench where Pen 's printer 's devil used to sit so many hours ; tapped her pale cheek with his finger , and bustled into the farther room . Mrs. Pendennis was ensconced pale and solemn in a great chair by Pen 's bedside . Her watch was on the bed - table by Pen 's medicines . Her bonnet and cloaks were laid in the window . She had her Bible in her lap , without which she never travelled . Her first movement , after seeing her son , had been to take Fanny 's shawl and bonnet which were on his drawers , and bring them out and drop them down upon his study - table . She had closed the door upon Major Pendennis , and Laura too ; and taken possession of her son . She had had a great doubt and terror lest Arthur should not know her ; but that pang was spared to her in part at least . Pen knew his mother quite well , and familiarly smiled and nodded at her . When she came in , he instantly fancied that they were at home at Fairoaks ; and began to talk and chatter and laugh in a rambling wild way . Laura could hear him outside . His laughter shot shafts of poison into her heart . It was true , then . He had been guilty - and with that creature ! - an intrigue with a servant - maid , and she had loved him - and he was dying most likely raving and unrepentant . The Major now and then hummed out a word of remark or consolation , which Laura scarce heard . A dismal sitting it was for all parties ; and when Goodenough appeared , he came like an angel into the room . It is not only for the sick man , it is for the sick man 's friends that the Doctor comes . His presence is often as good for them as for the patient , and they long for him yet more eagerly . How we have all watched after him ! what an emotion the thrill of his carriage - wheels in the street , and at length at the door , has made us feel ! how we hang upon his words , and what a comfort we get from a smile or two , if he can vouchsafe that sunshine to lighten our darkness ! Who has n't seen the mother prying into his face , to know if there is hope for the sick infant that can not speak , and that lies yonder , its little frame battling with fever ? Ah how she looks into his eyes ! What thanks if there is light there ; what grief and pain if he casts them down , and dares not say "
292597	292963	292967	292968	another woman	10246	" Or it is the house - father who is stricken . The terrified wife looks on , while the Physician feels his patient 's wrist , smothering her agonies , as the children have been called upon to stay their plays and their talk . Over the patient in the fever , the wife expectant , the children unconscious , the Doctor stands as if he were Fate , the dispenser of life and death : he must let the patient off this time : the woman prays so for his respite ! One can fancy how awful the responsibility must be to a conscientious man : how cruel the feeling that he has given the wrong remedy , or that it might have been possible to do better : how harassing the sympathy with survivors , if the case is unfortunate - how immense the delight of victory ! Having passed through a hasty ceremony of introduction to the new - comers , of whose arrival he had been made aware by the heartbroken little nurse in waiting without , the Doctor proceeded to examine the patient , about whose condition of high fever there could be no mistake , and on whom he thought it necessary to exercise the strongest antiphlogistic remedies in his power . He consoled the unfortunate mother as best he might ; and giving her the most comfortable assurances on which he could venture , that there was no reason to despair yet , that everything might still be hoped from his youth , the strength of his constitution , and so forth ; and having done his utmost to allay the horrors of the alarmed matron , he took the elder Pendennis aside into the vacant room Warrington 's bedroom , for the purpose of holding a little consultation . The case was very critical . The fever , if not stopped , might and would carry off the young fellow : he must be bled forthwith : the mother must be informed of this necessity . Why was that other young lady brought with her ? She was out of place in a sick - room . "
292976	292981	292984	292990	the little person who opened the door	10247	" the Major said , "
292992	293030	293037	293037	her	10246	" His sister - in - law had brought the poor little devil 's bonnet and shawl out , flung them upon the study - table . Did Goodenough know anything about the - the little person ? "
293043	293048	293037	293037	her	10246	" the Major said , "
293058	293112	293051	293051	she	10246	" The Doctor looked queer : the Doctor smiled - in the very gravest moments , with life and death pending , such strange contrasts and occasions of humour will arise , and such smiles will pass , to satirise the gloom , as it were , and to make it more gloomy ! "
293117	293178	293113	293113	I	0	" at last he said , re - entering the study ; and he wrote a couple of notes hastily at the table there , and sealed one of them . Then , taking up poor Fanny 's shawl and bonnet , and the notes , he went out in the passage to that poor little messenger , and said , "
293238	293514	293518	293518	bedad	3721	" So poor Fanny trudged away with her two notes , and found the apothecary , who lived in the Strand hard by , and who came straightway , his lancet in his pocket , to operate on his patient ; and then Fanny made for the Doctor 's house , in Hanover Square . The Doctor was at home again before the prescription was made up , which took Harbottle , his servant , such a long time in compounding ; and , during the remainder of Arthur 's illness , poor Fanny never made her appearance in the quality of nurse at his chambers any more . But for that day and the next , a little figure might be seen lurking about Pen 's staircase , - a sad , sad little face looked at and interrogated the apothecary , and the apothecary 's boy , and the laundress , and the kind physician himself , as they passed out of the chambers of the sick man . And on the third day , the kind Doctor 's chariot stopped at Shepherd 's Inn , and the good , and honest , and benevolent man went into the porter 's lodge , and tended a little patient whom he had there , for the best remedy he found was on the day when he was enabled to tell Fanny Bolton that the crisis was over , and that there was at length every hope for Arthur Pendennis . J. Costigan , Esquire , late of Her Majesty 's service , saw the Doctor 's carriage , and criticised its horses and appointments . "
293520	293525	293518	293518	bedad	3721	" the General said , "
293604	295172	293587	293587	he	10259	" and so pleased was Mr. Costigan with the Doctor 's behaviour and skill , that , whenever he met Dr. Goodenough 's carriage in future , he made a point of saluting it and the physician inside , in as courteous and magnificent a manner , as if Dr. Goodenough had been the Lord Liftenant himself , and Captain Costigan had been in his glory in Phaynix Park . The widow 's gratitude to the physician knew no bounds - or scarcely any bounds , at least . The kind gentleman laughed at the idea of taking a fee from a literary man , or the widow of a brother practitioner ; and she determined when she got to Fairoaks that she would send Goodenough the silver - gilt vase , the jewel of the house , and the glory of the late John Pendennis , preserved in green baize , and presented to him at Bath , by the Lady Elizabeth Firebrace , on the recovery of her son , the late Sir Anthony Firebrace , from the scarlet fever . Hippocrates , Hygeia , King Bladud , and a wreath of serpents surmount the cup to this day ; which was executed in their finest manner by Messrs. Abednego , of Milsom Street ; and the inscription was by Mr. Birch , tutor to the young baronet . This priceless gem of art the widow determined to devote to Goodenough , the preserver of her son ; and there was scarcely any other favour which her gratitude would not have conferred upon him , except one , which he desired most , and which was that she should think a little charitably and kindly of poor Fanny , of whose artless , sad story he had got something during his interviews with her , and of whom he was induced to think very kindly , - not being disposed , indeed , to give much credit to Pen for his conduct in the affair , or not knowing what that conduct had been . He knew enough , however , to be aware that the poor infatuated little girl was without stain as yet ; that while she had been in Pen 's room it was to see the last of him , as she thought , and that Arthur was scarcely aware of her presence ; and that she suffered under the deepest and most pitiful grief , at the idea of losing him , dead or living . But on the one or two occasions when Goodenough alluded to Fanny , the widow 's countenance , always soft and gentle , assumed an expression so cruel and inexorable , that the Doctor saw it was in vain to ask her for justice or pity , and he broke off all entreaties , and ceased making any further allusions regarding his little client . There is a complaint which neither poppy , nor mandragora , nor all the drowsy syrups of the East could allay , in the men in his time , as we are informed by a popular poet of the days of Elizabeth ; and which , when exhibited in women , no medical discoveries or practice subsequent - neither homoeopathy , nor hydropathy , nor mesmerism , nor Dr. Simpson , nor Dr. Locock can cure , and that is - we wo n't call it jealousy , but rather gently denominate rivalry and emulation in ladies . Some of those mischievous and prosaic people who carp and calculate at every detail of the romancer , and want to know , for instance , how , when the characters in the ' Critic ' are at a dead lock with their daggers at each other 's throats , they are to be got out of that murderous complication of circumstances , may be induced to ask how it was possible in a set of chambers in the Temple , consisting of three rooms , two cupboards , a passage , and a coal - box , Arthur a sick gentleman , Helen his mother , Laura her adopted daughter , Martha their country attendant , Mrs. Wheezer a nurse from St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , Mrs. Flanagan an Irish laundress , Major Pendennis a retired military officer , Morgan his valet , Pidgeon Mr. Arthur Pendennis 's boy , and others could be accommodated - the answer is given at once , that almost everybody in the Temple was out of town , and that there was scarcely a single occupant of Pen 's house in Lamb Court except those who were occupied round the sick - bed of the sick gentleman , about whose fever we have not given a lengthy account , neither enlarge we very much upon the more cheerful theme of his recovery . Everybody we have said was out of town , and of course such a fashionable man as young Mr. Sibwright , who occupied chambers on the second floor in Pen 's staircase , could not be supposed to remain in London . Mrs. Flanagan , Mr. Pendennis 's laundress was acquainted with Mrs. Rouncy who did for Mr. Sibwright ; and that gentleman 's bedroom was got ready for Miss Bell , or Mrs. Pendennis , when the latter should be inclined to leave her son 's sick - room , to try and seek for a little rest for herself . If that young buck and flower of Baker Street , Percy Sibwright , could have known who was the occupant of his bedroom , how proud he would have been of that apartment : - what poems he would have written about Laura ! several of his things have appeared in the annuals , and in manuscript in the nobility 's albums - he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem , it was said - Sibwright , however , was absent and his bed given up to Miss Bell . It was the prettiest little brass bed in the world , with chintz curtains lined with pink - he had a mignonette - box in his bedroom window , and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny boots , arranged in trim rows over his wardrobe , was a gratification to the beholder . He had a museum of scent , pomatum , and bear's - grease pots , quite curious to examine , too ; and a choice selection of portraits of females , almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or deshabille , glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose . Medora with dishevelled hair was consoling herself over her banjo for the absence of her Conrad - the Princesse Fleur de Marie of Rudolstein and the Mysteres de Paris was sadly ogling out of the bars of her convent cage , in which , poor prisoned bird , she was moulting away , - Dorothea of Don Quixote was washing her eternal feet : - in fine , it was such an elegant gallery as became a gallant lover of the sex . And in Sibwright 's sitting - room , while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh new - born calf , there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read , and of English and French works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much . His invitation cards of the past season still decorated his looking - glass : and scarce anything told of the lawyer but the wig - box beside the Venus upon the middle shelf of the bookcase , on which the name of P. Sibwright , Esquire , was gilded . With Sibwright in chambers was Mr. Bangham . Mr. Bangham was a sporting man married to a rich widow . Mr. Bangham had no practice - did not come to chambers thrice in a term : went a circuit for those mysterious reasons which make men go circuit , - and his room served as a great convenience to Sibwright when that young gentleman gave his little dinners . It must be confessed that these two gentlemen have nothing to do with our history , will never appear in it again probably , but we can not help glancing through their doors as they happen to be open to us , and as we pass to Pen 's rooms ; as in the pursuit of our own business in life through the Strand , at the Club , nay at church itself , we can not help peeping at the shops on the way , or at our neighbour 's dinner , or at the faces under the bonnets in the next pew . Very many years after the circumstances about which we are at present occupied , Laura , with a blush and a laugh showing much humour , owned to having read a French novel once much in vogue , and when her husband asked her , wondering where on earth she could have got such a volume , she owned that it was in the Temple , when she lived in Mr. Percy Sibwright 's chambers . "
295181	295185	295177	295177	I	0	" she said , "
295230	296164	296183	296183	he	1359	" Suppose Percy Sibwright had come in at such a moment as that ? What would he have said , - the enraptured rogue ? What would have been all the pictures of disguised beauties in his room compared to that living one ? Ah , we are speaking of old times , when Sibwright was a bachelor and before he got a county court , - when people were young - when most people were young . Other people are young now ; but we no more . When Miss Laura played this prank with the wig , you ca n't suppose that Pen could have been very ill upstairs ; otherwise , though she had grown to care for him ever so little , common sense of feeling and decorum would have prevented her from performing any tricks or trying any disguises . But all sorts of events had occurred in the course of the last few days which had contributed to increase or account for her gaiety , and a little colony of the reader 's old friends and acquaintances was by this time established in Lamb Court , Temple , and round Pen 's sick - bed there . First , Martha , Mrs. Pendennis 's servant , had arrived from Fairoaks , being summoned thence by the Major who justly thought her presence would be comfortable and useful to her mistress and her young master , for neither of whom the constant neighbourhood of Mrs. Flanagan who during Pen 's illness required more spirituous consolation than ever to support her could be pleasant . Martha then made her appearance in due season to wait upon Mr. Pendennis , nor did that lady go once to bed until the faithful servant had reached her , when , with a heart full of maternal thankfulness she went and lay down upon Warrington 's straw mattress , and among his mathematical books as has been already described . It is true that ere that day a great and delightful alteration in Pen 's condition had taken place . The fever , subjugated by Dr. Goodenough 's blisters , potions , and lancet , had left the young man , or only returned at intervals of feeble intermittence ; his wandering senses had settled in his weakened brain : he had had time to kiss and bless his mother for coming to him , and calling for Laura and his uncle who were both affected according to their different natures by his wan appearance , his lean shrunken hands , his hollow eyes and voice , his thin bearded face to press their hands and thank them affectionately ; and after this greeting , and after they had been turned out of the room by his affectionate nurse , he had sunk into a fine sleep which had lasted for about sixteen hours , at the end of which period he awoke calling out that he was very hungry . If it is hard to be ill and to loathe food , oh , how pleasant to be getting well and to be feeling hungry - how hungry ! Alas , the joys of convalescence become feebler with increasing years , as other joys do - and then - and then comes that illness when one does not convalesce at all . On the day of this happy event , too , came another arrival in Lamb Court . This was introduced into the Pen - Warring sitting - room by large puffs of tobacco smoke - the puffs of were followed by an individual with a cigar in his mouth , and a carpet - bag under his arm - this was Warrington who had run back from Norfolk , when Mr. Bows thoughtfully wrote to inform him of his friend 's calamity . But he had been from home when Bows 's letter had reached his brother 's house - the Eastern Counties did not then boast of a railway for we beg the reader to understand that we only commit anachronisms when we choose and when by a daring violation of those natural laws some great ethical truth is to be advanced - in fine , Warrington only appeared with the rest of the good luck upon the lucky day after Pen 's convalescence may have been said to have begun . His surprise was , after all , not very great when he found the chambers of his sick friend occupied , and his old acquaintance the Major seated demurely in an easy - chair Warrington had let himself into the rooms with his own passkey , listening , or pretending to listen , to a young lady who was reading to him a play of Shakspeare in a low sweet voice . The lady stopped and started , and laid down her book , at the apparition of the tall traveller with the cigar and the carpet - bag . He blushed , he flung the cigar into the passage : he took off his hat , and dropped that too , and going up to the Major , seized that old gentleman 's hand , and asked questions about Arthur . The Major answered in a tremulous , though cheery voice - it was curious how emotion seemed to olden him - and returning Warrington 's pressure with a shaking hand , told him the news of Arthur 's happy crisis , of his mother 's arrival - with her young charge - with Miss - - "
296165	296174	296175	296176	Mr. Warrington	1359	" You need not tell me her name , "
296197	296214	296183	296183	he	1359	" you need not tell me your name . I knew at once it was Laura . "
296250	296256	296257	296257	his	1359	" And this is Laura ! "
296263	296269	296257	296257	his	1359	" And this is Warrington ! "
296278	296308	296257	296257	his	1359	" Arthur 's hero - the brave and the kind - he has come hundreds of miles to succour him , when he heard of his friend 's misfortune ! "
296309	296316	296320	296320	Laura	799	" Thank you , Mr. Warrington , "
296405	296408	296386	296387	another lady	10267	" Hsh ! "
296440	296467	296468	296468	he	1359	" Come in , Stunner - come in , Warrington . I knew it was you - by the - by the smoke , old boy , "
296496	296508	296509	296509	Warrington	1359	" I - I beg pardon , ma'am , for smoking , "
296529	296537	296525	296525	Helen	1844	" God bless you , Mr. Warrington . "
297598	297662	297668	297669	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" I know the crack of his whip in a hundred , and the cut which the fellow 's thong leaves . There 's Jack Bludyer , goes to work like a butcher , and mangles a subject . Mr. Warrington finished a man , and lays his cuts neat and regular , straight down the back , and drawing blood every line ; "
297672	297708	297668	297669	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" Law , Charles , how can you talk so ! I always thought Mr. Warrington very high , but a kind gentleman ; and I 'm sure he was most kind to the children . "
297714	297828	297711	297711	Shandon	1481	" yes ; he 's kind to the children ; but he 's savage to the men ; and to be sure , my dear , you do n't understand a word about what I 'm saying ; and it 's best you should n't ; for it 's little good comes out of writing for newspapers ; and it 's better here , living easy at Boulogne , where the wine 's plenty , and the brandy costs but two francs a bottle . Mix us another tumbler , Mary , my dear ; we 'll go back into harness soon . ' Cras ingens iterabimus aequor ' bad luck to it . "
297859	297864	297833	297833	Warrington	1359	" with a vengeance , "
297947	297974	297975	297975	he	1359	" The people in this country , ma'am , do n't understand what style is , or they would see the merits of our young one , "
297981	298070	297975	297975	he	1359	" I call him ours , ma'am , for I bred him ; and I am as proud of him as you are ; and , bating a little wilfulness , and a little selfishness , and a little dandification , I do n't know a more honest , or loyal , or gentle creature . His pen is wicked sometimes , but he is as kind as a young lady - as Miss Laura here - and I believe he would not do any living mortal harm . "
298148	298158	298159	298159	he	1359	" He is a gentleman , my dear creature , "
298164	298271	298159	298159	he	1359	" every inch a gentleman , my good madam - the Suffolk Warringtons - Charles the First 's baronets : - what could he be but a gentleman , come out of that family ? - father , - Sir Miles Warrington ; ran away with - beg your pardon , Miss Bell . Sir Miles was a very well known man in London , and a friend of the Prince of Wales , This gentleman is a man of the greatest talents , the very highest accomplishments , - sure to get on , if he had a motive to put his energies to work . "
298435	298489	298430	298431	the Major	2155	" Yes , yes , begad - of course you go out with him - it 's like the country , you know ; everybody goes out with everybody in the Gardens , and there are beadles , you know , and that sort of thing - everybody walks in the Temple Gardens . "

Miss Bell 's a little countryfied . But the smell of the hawthorn is pleasant , demmy . How she blushes ! Your London girls would give many a guinea for a bouquet like that - natural flowers , begad ! And she 's a little money too - nothing to speak of - but a pooty little bit of money . "

302875	303092	302872	302872	George	1359	" What has an ugly , rough old fellow like me , to make any woman like him ? I 'm getting old , and I 've made no mark in life . I 've neither good looks , nor youth , nor money , nor reputation . A man must be able to do something besides stare at her and offer on his knees his smooth devotion , to make a woman like him . What can I do ? Lots of young fellows have passed me in the race - what they call the prizes of life did n't seem to me worth the trouble of the struggle . But for her . If she had been mine and liked a diamond - ah ! should n't she have worn it ! Psha , what a fool I am to brag of what I would have done ! We are the slaves of destiny . Our lots are shaped for us , and mine is ordained long ago . Come , let us have a pipe , and put the smell of these flowers out of court , poor little silent flowers ! you 'll be dead to - morrow . What business had you to show your red cheeks in this dingy place ? "
303936	304007	303921	303921	his	15207	" My dear , good creature , I do n't know anything about it ; and I do n't wish to know anything about it ; and , as you ask me my opinion , I think you had best know nothing about it too . Young men will be young men ; begad , and , my good ma'am , if you think our boy is a Jo - - "
304008	304015	304016	304016	Helen	1844	" Pray , spare me this , "
304024	304041	304042	304043	the Major	2155	" My dear creature , I did not commence the conversation , permit me to say , "
304050	304073	304074	304075	the widow	13904	" I ca n't bear to hear such a sin - such a dreadful sin - spoken of in such a way , "
304087	304179	304074	304075	the widow	13904	" I ca n't bear to think that my boy should commit such a crime . I wish he had died , almost , before he had done it . I do n't know how I survive it myself ; for it is breaking my heart , Major Pendennis , to think that his father 's son - my child - whom I remember so good - oh , so good , and full of honour ! - should be fallen so dreadfully low , as to - as to - - "
304180	304193	304195	304196	the Major	2155	" As to flirt with a little grisette , my dear creature ? "
304198	304268	304195	304196	the Major	2155	" Egad , if all the mothers in England were to break their hearts because - Nay , nay ; upon my word and honour , now , do n't agitate yourself - do n't cry . I ca n't bear to see a woman 's tears - I never could - never . But how do we know that anything serious has happened ? Has Arthur said anything ? "
304269	304275	304281	304281	her	697	" His silence confirms it , "
304286	304311	304281	304281	her	697	" Not at all . There are subjects , my dear , about which a young fellow can not surely talk to his mamma , "
304320	304327	304329	304330	the lady	14974	" She has written to him , "
304336	304348	304329	304330	the lady	14974	" What , before he was ill ? Nothing more likely . "
304349	304354	304355	304360	the mourner with the batiste mask	10596	" No , since , "

304545	304551	304571	304571	you	0	" broke out Helen , - "
304579	304585	304575	304575	you	0	" When the good soul said "
304592	304668	304575	304575	you	0	" the Major could not speak at all , so inclined was he to laugh , in spite of the agonies of the poor soul before him , and for whom he had a hearty pity and liking too . But each was looking at the matter with his or her peculiar eyes and views of morals , and the Major 's morals , as the reader knows , were not those of an ascetic . "
304673	304678	304680	304680	you	0	" he gravely continued , "
304733	304734	304735	304735	I	0	" "
304744	304867	304735	304735	I	0	" said the widow . It had been put silently into the letter - box two days previous to their departure from the Temple , and had been brought to Mrs. Pendennis by Martha . She had never seen Fanny 's handwriting , of course ; but when the letter was put into her hands she knew the author at once . She had been on the watch for that letter every day since Pen had been ill . She had opened some of his other letters because she wanted to get at that one . She had the horrid paper poisoning her bag at that moment . She took it out and offered it to her brother - in - law . "
304874	304892	304871	304872	Esq .	4446	" he read in a timid little sprawling handwriting , and with a sneer on his face . "
304953	304975	304949	304949	you	10611	" Here the Major began to look a little queer for his own part , and put on his demure look - "
305184	305185	305174	305174	he	1844	" "
305188	305196	305174	305174	he	1844	" said the widow with bitter scorn . "
305234	305235	305220	305220	I	0	" "
305243	305306	305240	305240	you	2536	" screamed out the Major ; and remembering former passages in Arthur 's history and Helen 's , the truth came across his mind that , were Helen to make this prayer to her son , he would marry the girl : he was wild enough and obstinate enough to commit any folly when a woman he loved was in the case . "
305317	305340	305314	305314	your	15401	" he continued after an agitated pause , during which the above dreary reflection crossed him ; and in a softened tone , "
305531	305532	305534	305534	you	0	" "
305544	305548	305538	305539	Thank Heaven	725	" Helen cried . "
305606	305691	305601	305601	me	0	" Old Pendennis had his own opinion . When he briskly took the not guilty side of the case , but a moment before , very likely the old gentleman had a different view from that which he chose to advocate , and judged of Arthur by what he himself would have done . If she goes to Arthur , and he speaks the truth , as the rascal will , it spoils all , he thought . And he tried one more effort . "
305698	305710	305695	305696	good soul	10651	" he said , taking Helen 's hand and kissing it , "
305849	305868	305846	305847	Mrs. Flanagan	1374	" The widow burst out laughing through her tears - the victory was gained by the old general . "
305876	305885	305874	305874	Ged	927	" he continued , tapping her slender hand . "
305973	305974	305966	305966	he	13873	" "
305988	305994	305995	305995	My	0	" the widow cried out . "
306199	306200	306194	306194	I	0	" "
306212	306216	306202	306203	Mr. Warrington	1359	" asked Helen . "
306237	306238	306232	306232	Pen	1844	" "
306272	306282	306266	306266	I	0	" cried out the Major , in some alarm . "
306317	306330	306341	306341	You	10679	" The simple widow took her brother 's hand and pressed it . "
306336	306340	306341	306341	You	10679	" she said . "
306424	306425	306422	306422	sir	2261	" "
306434	306483	306422	306422	sir	2261	" said the old fellow , kissing her affectionately , and quite overcome by her tenderness . He looked after her as she retreated , with a fondness which was rendered more piquant , as it were , by the mixture of a certain scorn which accompanied it . "
306486	306490	306491	306491	I	0	" he said ; "
306515	307056	306503	306503	he	2615	" Having achieved this victory , the fatigued and happy warrior laid himself down on the sofa , and put his yellow silk pocket - handkerchief over his face , and indulged in a snug little nap , of which the dreams , no doubt , were very pleasant , as he snored with refreshing regularity . The young men sate , meanwhile , dawdling away the sunshiny hours on the terrace , very happy , and Pen , at least , very talkative . He was narrating to Warrington a plan for a new novel , and a new tragedy . Warrington laughed at the idea of his writing a tragedy ? By Jove , he would show that he could ; and he began to spout some of the lines of his play . The little solo on the wind instrument which the Major was performing was interrupted by the entrance of Miss Bell . She had been on a visit to her old friend , Lady Rockminster , who had taken a summer villa in the neighbourhood ; and who , hearing of Arthur 's illness , and his mother 's arrival at Richmond , had visited the latter ; and , for the benefit of the former , whom she did n't like , had been prodigal of grapes , partridges , and other attentions . For Laura the old lady had a great fondness , and longed that she should come and stay with her ; but Laura could not leave her mother at this juncture . Worn out by constant watching over Arthur 's health , Helen 's own had suffered very considerably ; and Doctor Goodenough had had reason to prescribe for her as well as for his younger patient . Old Pendennis started up on the entrance of the young lady . His slumbers were easily broken . He made her a gallant speech - he had been full of gallantry towards her of late . Where had she been gathering those roses which she wore on her cheeks ? How happy he was to be disturbed out of his dreams by such a charming reality ! Laura had plenty of humour and honesty ; and these two caused her to have on her side something very like a contempt for the old gentleman . It delighted her to draw out his worldlinesses , and to make the old habitue of clubs and drawing - rooms tell his twaddling tales about great folks , and expound his views of morals . Not in this instance , however , was she disposed to be satirical . She had been to drive with Lady Rockminster in the Park , she said ; and she had brought home game for Pen , and flowers for mamma . She looked very grave about mamma . She had just been with Mrs. Pendennis . Helen was very much worn , and she feared she was very , very ill . Her large eyes filled with tender marks of the sympathy which she felt in her beloved friend 's condition . She was alarmed about her . Could not that good - that dear Dr. Goodenough cure her ? "
307066	307072	306503	306503	he	2615	" the Major slowly said , "
307081	307113	307079	307079	Helen	1844	" A burning blush upon the girl 's face showed that she understood the old man 's allusion . But she looked him full in the face and made no reply . "
307121	307125	307114	307114	He	10686	" she thought . "
307138	307459	307128	307128	he	10686	" That he had an aim in view is very possible . The old diplomatist seldom spoke without some such end . Doctor Goodenough had talked to him , he said , about their dear friend 's health , and she wanted rest and change of scene - yes , change of scene . Painful circumstances which had occurred must be forgotten and never alluded to ; he begged pardon for even hinting at them to Miss Bell - he never should do so again - nor , he was sure , would she . Everything must be done to soothe and comfort their friend , and his proposal was that they should go abroad for the autumn to a watering - place in the Rhine neighbourhood , where Helen might rally her exhausted spirits , and Arthur try and become a new man . Of course , Laura would not forsake her mother ? Of course not . It was about Helen , and Helen only - that is , about Arthur too for her sake , that Laura was anxious . She would go abroad or anywhere with Helen . And Helen having thought the matter over for an hour in her room , had by that time grown to be as anxious for the tour as any schoolboy , who has been reading a book of voyages , is eager to go to sea . Whither should they go ? the farther the better - to some place so remote that even recollection could not follow them thither : so delightful that Pen should never want to leave it - anywhere so that he could be happy . She opened her desk with trembling fingers and took out her banker 's book , and counted up her little savings . If more was wanted , she had the diamond cross . She would borrow from Laura again . "
307468	307472	307128	307128	he	10686	" she thought ; "
307501	307515	307487	307488	Doctor Goodenough	1825	" The good Doctor drove over to dine with them that very day . "
307522	307528	307517	307517	you	10689	" he said to her , "
307661	307775	307778	307780	not a soul	10695	" When the plan of going abroad was proposed , it was received by that gentleman with the greatest alacrity and enthusiasm . He longed to be off at once . He let his mustachios grow from that very moment , in order , I suppose , that he might get his mouth into training for a perfect French and German pronunciation ; and he was seriously disquieted in his mind because the mustachios , when they came , were of a decidedly red colour . He had looked forward to an autumn at Fairoaks ; and perhaps the idea of passing two or three months there did not amuse the young man . "
307788	307794	307795	307795	I	0	" he said to Warrington . "
307902	307969	307991	307992	your mother	2724	" And here he narrated to his friend the circumstances of the Vauxhall affair , with which the reader is already acquainted . Warrington looked very grave when he heard this story . Putting the moral delinquency out of the question , he was extremely glad for Arthur 's sake that the latter had escaped from a danger which might have made his whole life wretched ; "
307973	307977	307991	307992	your mother	2724	" said Warrington , "
308009	308028	308033	308034	my mother	2288	" urged Pen 's companion , little knowing what grief and annoyance these good people had already suffered . "
308036	308048	308033	308034	my mother	2288	" Pen cried out , in a state of great alarm . "
308071	308108	308056	308060	An esclandre of that sort	10706	" he added , with a knowing air , and as if , like a young rascal of a Lovelace , he had been engaged in what are called affaires de coeur , all his life ; "
308138	308139	308130	308130	one	14276	" "
308147	308151	308142	308142	you	0	" Warrington asked . "
308154	308158	308142	308142	you	0	" said Lovelace . "
308173	308313	308166	308166	she	2288	" O Clarissas of this life , O you poor little ignorant vain foolish maidens ! if you did but know the way in which the Lovelaces speak of you : if you could but hear Jack talking to Tom across the coffee - room of a Club ; or see Ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigar - case , and handing them over to Charley , and Billy , and Harry across the messroom table , you would not be so eager to write , or so ready to listen ! There 's a sort of crime which is not complete unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterwards ; and the man who betrays your honour in the first place , is pretty sure , remember that , to betray your secret too . "
308327	308332	308166	308166	she	2288	" said Warring gloomily . "
308361	308478	308335	308335	you	10709	" After this little discourse upon a subject about which Pen would have talked a great deal more eloquently a month back , the conversation reverted to the plans for going abroad , and Arthur eagerly pressed his friend to be of the party . Warrington was a part of the family - a part of the cure . Arthur said he should not have half the pleasure without Warrington . But George said no , he could n't go . He must stop at home and take Pen 's place . The other remarked that that was needless , for Shandon was now come back to London , and Arthur was entitled to a holiday . "
308484	308488	308335	308335	you	10709	" Warrington said , "
308531	308596	308528	308528	you	10711	" This little obstacle seemed fatal to Pen . He mentioned it to his mother : Mrs. Pendennis was very sorry ; Mr. Warrington had been exceedingly kind ; but she supposed he knew best about his affairs . And then , no doubt , she reproached herself , for selfishness in wishing to carry the boy off and have him to herself altogether . "
308610	308633	308603	308603	Pen	1844	" the Major asked one day , when the pair were alone and after Warrington 's objection had been stated to him . "
308812	308935	308796	308796	he	1844	" Still , in spite of this kind offer and unheard - of generosity on the part of the Major , George Warrington refused , and said he would stay at home . But it was with a faltering voice and an irresolute accent which showed how much he would like to go , though his tongue persisted in saying nay . But the Major 's persevering benevolence was not to be baulked in this way . At the tea - table that evening , Helen happening to be absent from the room for the moment , looking for Pen who had gone to roost , old Pendennis returned to the charge and rated Warrington for refusing to join in their excursion . "
308944	308954	308941	308942	Miss Bell	741	" he said , turning to that young lady . "
308980	309015	308972	308975	this odious selfish creature	10726	" Miss Bell 's long eyelashes looked down towards her teacup : and Warrington blushed hugely but did not speak . Neither did Miss Bell speak : but when he blushed she blushed too . "
309025	309032	309016	309016	You	741	" said the benevolent old gentleman , "
309043	309044	309036	309036	he	10726	" "
309053	309072	309074	309074	him	10726	" asked the young lady , putting the query to her teaspoon seemingly and not to the Major . "
309082	309089	309076	309076	you	741	" said Pen 's artless uncle . "
309104	309111	309113	309113	you	741	" remarked Laura to the teaspoon . "
309115	309125	309113	309113	you	741	" said George . She looked up and said , "
309128	309133	309113	309113	you	741	" Their eyes met . "
309146	309178	309113	309113	you	741	" said George , lowly , and forcing out the words as if they gave him pain . Old Pendennis was delighted ; the affectionate old creature clapped his hands and cried "
309201	309274	309113	309113	you	741	" And Laura , with a look full of tender brightness , put out her hand to Warrington . He took hers ; his face indicated a strange agitation . He seemed to be about to speak , when from Pen 's neighbouring room Helen entered , looking at them as the candle which she held lighted her pale frightened face . Laura blushed more red than ever and withdrew her hand . "
309279	309283	309113	309113	you	741	" Helen asked . "
309297	309307	309288	309288	we	10729	" said the Major in his most caressing voice . "
309324	309325	309313	309314	Mr. Warrington	1359	" "
309328	309759	309313	309314	Mr. Warrington	1359	" Helen said . CHAPTER LVI In which Fanny engages a new Medical Man Could Helen have suspected that , with Pen 's returning strength , his unhappy partiality for little Fanny would also reawaken ? Though she never spoke a word regarding that young person , after her conversation with the Major , and though , to all appearances , she utterly ignored Fanny 's existence , yet Mrs. Pendennis kept a particularly close watch upon all Master Arthur 's actions ; on the plea of ill - health would scarcely let him out of her sight ; and was especially anxious that he should be spared the trouble of all correspondence for the present at least . Very likely Arthur looked at his own letters with some tremor ; very likely , as he received them at the family table , feeling his mother 's watch upon him though the good soul 's eye seemed fixed upon her teacup or her book , he expected daily to see a little handwriting , which he would have known , though he had never seen it yet , and his heart beat as he received the letters to his address . Was he more pleased or annoyed , that , day after day , his expectations were not realised ; and was his mind relieved , that there came no letter from Fanny ? Though , no doubt , in these matters , when Lovelace is tired of Clarissa or the contrary it is best for both parties to break at once , and each , after the failure of the attempt at union , to go his own way , and pursue his course through life solitary ; yet our self - love , or our pity , or our sense of decency , does not like that sudden bankruptcy . Before we announce to the world that our firm of Lovelace and Co. ca n't meet its engagements , we try to make compromises : we have mournful meetings of partners : we delay the putting up of the shutters , and the dreary announcement of the failure . It must come : but we pawn our jewels to keep things going a little longer . On the whole , I dare say , Pen was rather annoyed that he had no remonstrances from Fanny . What ! could she part from him , and never so much as once look round ? could she sink , and never once hold a little hand out , or cry , "
309764	310211	309762	309762	Arthur	739	" Well , well : they do n't all go down who venture on that voyage . Some few drown when the vessel founders ; but most are only ducked , and scramble to shore . And the reader 's experience of A. Pendennis , Esquire , of the Upper Temple , will enable him to state whether that gentleman belonged to the class of persons who were likely to sink or to swim . Though Pen was as yet too weak to walk half a mile ; and might not , on account of his precious health , be trusted to take a drive in a carriage by himself , and without a nurse in attendance ; yet Helen could not keep watch over Mr. Warrington too , and had no authority to prevent that gentleman from going to London if business called him thither . Indeed , if he had gone and stayed , perhaps the widow , from reasons of her own , would have been glad ; but she checked these selfish wishes as soon as she ascertained or owned them ; and , remembering Warrington 's great regard and services , and constant friendship for her boy , received him as a member of her family almost , with her usual melancholy kindness and submissive acquiescence . Yet somehow , one morning when his affairs called him to town , she divined what Warrington 's errand was , and that he was gone to London to get news about Fanny for Pen . Indeed , Arthur had had some talk with his friend , and told him more at large what his adventures had been with Fanny adventures which the reader knows already , and what were his feelings respecting her . He was very thankful that he had escaped the great danger , to which Warrington said Amen heartily : that he had no great fault wherewith to reproach himself in regard of his behaviour to her , but that if they parted , as they must , he would be glad to say a God bless her , and to hope that she would remember him kindly . In his discourse with Warrington he spoke upon these matters with so much gravity , and so much emotion , that George , who had pronounced himself most strongly for the separation too , began to fear that his friend was not so well cured as he boasted of being ; and that , if the two were to come together again , all the danger and the temptation might have to be fought once more . And with what result ? "
310227	310231	310218	310218	Arthur	739	" Warrington said : "
310263	310272	310273	310273	Pen	1844	" And what did you practise , George ? "
310278	310292	310273	310273	Pen	1844	" I knew there was something . Tell us about it , Warrington . "
310293	310311	310312	310312	Warrington	1359	" There was something that ca n't be mended , and that shattered my whole fortunes early , "
310315	310388	310312	310312	Warrington	1359	" I said I would tell you about it some day , Pen : and will , but not now . Take the moral without the fable now , Pen , my boy ; and if you want to see a man whose whole life has been wrecked , by an unlucky rock against which he struck as a boy - here he is , Arthur : and so I warn you . "
311284	311950	311272	311272	Huxey	1872	" and when in the society of his own friends , was a very different fellow to the youth whom we have seen cowed by Pen 's impertinent airs , and , adored by his family at home , was the life and soul of the circle whom he met , either round the festive board or the dissecting table . On one brilliant September morning , as Huxter was regaling himself with a cup of coffee at a stall in Covent Garden , having spent a delicious night dancing at Vauxhall , he spied the General reeling down Henrietta Street , with a crowd of hooting blackguard boys at his heels , who had left their beds under the arches of the river betimes , and were prowling about already for breakfast , and the strange livelihood of the day . The poor old General was not in that condition when the sneers and jokes of these young beggars had much effect upon him : the cabmen and watermen at the cabstand knew him and passed their comments upon him : the policemen gazed after him and warned the boys off him , with looks of scorn and pity ; what did the scorn and pity of men , the jokes of ribald children , matter to the General ? He reeled along the street with glazed eyes , having just sense enough to know whither he was bound , and to pursue his accustomed beat homewards . He went to bed not knowing how he had reached it , as often as any man in London . He woke and found himself there , and asked no questions , and he was tacking about on this daily though perilous voyage , when , from his station at the coffee - stall , Huxter spied him . To note his friend , to pay his twopence indeed , he had but eightpence left , or he would have had a cab from Vauxhall to take him home , was with the eager Huxter the work of an instant - Costigan dived down the alleys by Drury Lane Theatre , where gin - shops , oyster - shops , and theatrical wardrobes abound , the proprietors of which were now asleep behind their shutters , as the pink morning lighted up their chimneys ; and through these courts Huxter followed the General , until he reached Oldcastle Street , in which is the gate of Shepherd 's Inn . Here , just as he was within sight of home , a luckless slice of orange - peel came between the General 's heel and the pavement , and caused the poor old fellow to fall backwards . Huxter ran up to him instantly , and after a pause , during which the veteran , giddy with his fall and his previous whisky , gathered , as he best might , his dizzy brains together , the young surgeon lifted up the limping General , and very kindly and good - naturedly offered to conduct him to his home . For some time , and in reply to the queries which the student of medicine put to him , the muzzy General refused to say where his lodgings were and declared that they were hard by , and that he could reach them without difficulty ; and he disengaged himself from Huxter 's arm , and made a rush as if to get to his own home unattended : but he reeled and lurched so , that the young surgeon insisted upon accompanying him , and , with many soothing expressions and cheering and consolatory phrases , succeeded in getting the General 's dirty old hand under what he called his own fin , and led the old fellow , moaning piteously , across the street . He stopped when he came to the ancient gate , ornamented with the armorial bearings of the venerable Shepherd . "
311955	312031	311272	311272	Huxey	1872	" said he , drawing up at the portal , and he made a successful pull at the gate bell , which presently brought out old Mr. Bolton , the porter , scowling fiercely , and grumbling as he was used to do every morning when it became his turn to let in that early bird . Costigan tried to hold Bolton for a moment in genteel conversation , but the other surlily would not . "
312037	312041	311272	311272	Huxey	1872	" said he ; "
312059	312844	312053	312054	honest men	10802	" So the Captain tacked across the square and reached his own staircase , up which he stumbled with the worthy Huxter at his heels . Costigan had a key of his own , which Huxter inserted into the keyhole for him , so that there was no need to call up little Mr. Bows from the sleep into which the old musician had not long since fallen , and Huxter having aided to disrobe his tipsy patient , and ascertained that no bones were broken , helped him to bed and applied compresses an water to one of his knees and shins , which , with the pair of trousers which encased them , Costigan had severely torn in his fall . At the General 's age , and with his habit of body , such wounds as he had inflicted on himself are slow to heal : a good deal of inflammation ensued , and the old fellow lay ill for some days , suffering both pain and fever . Mr. Huxter undertook the case of his interesting patient with great confidence and alacrity , and conducted it with becoming skill . He visited his friend day after day , and consoled him with lively rattle and conversation for the absence of the society which Costigan needed , and of which he was an ornament ; and he gave special instructions to the invalid 's nurse about the quantity of whisky which the patient was to take - instructions which , as the poor old fellow could not for many days get out of his bed or sofa himself , he could not by any means infringe . Bows , Mrs. Bolton , and our little friend Fanny , when able to do so , officiated at the General 's bedside , and the old warrior was made as comfortable as possible under his calamity . Thus Huxter , whose affable manners and social turn made him quickly intimate with persons in whose society he fell , and whose over - refinement did not lead them to repulse the familiarities of this young gentleman , became pretty soon intimate in Shepherd 's Inn , both with our acquaintances in the garrets and those in the porter 's lodge . He thought he had seen Fanny somewhere : he felt certain that he had : but it is no wonder that he should not accurately remember her , for the poor little thing never chose to tell him where she had met him : he himself had seen her at a period , when his own views both of persons and of right and wrong were clouded by the excitement of drinking and dancing , and also little Fanny was very much changed and worn by the fever and agitation , and passion and despair , which the past three weeks had poured upon the head of that little victim . Borne down was the head now , and very pale and wan the face ; and many and many a time the sad eyes had looked into the postman 's , as he came to the Inn , and the sickened heart had sunk as he passed away . When Mr. Costigan 's accident occurred , Fanny was rather glad to have an opportunity of being useful and doing something kind - something that would make her forget her own little sorrows perhaps : she felt she bore them better whilst she did her duty , though I dare say many a tear dropped into the old Irishman 's gruel . Ah , me ! stir the gruel well , and have courage , little Fanny ! If everybody who has suffered from your complaint were to die of it straightway , what a fine year the undertakers would have ! Whether from compassion for his only patient , or delight in his society , Mr. Huxter found now occasion to visit Costigan two or three times in the day at least , and if any of the members of the porter 's lodge family were not in attendance on the General , the young doctor was sure to have some particular directions to address to those at their own place of habitation . He was a kind fellow ; he made or purchased toys for the children ; he brought them apples and brandy - balls ; he brought a mask and frightened them with it , and caused a smile upon the face of pale Fanny . He called Mrs. Bolton Mrs. B. , and was very intimate , familiar , and facetious with that lady , quite different from that "
312850	313446	312053	312054	honest men	10802	" as Mrs. Bolton now denominated a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance , and whom she now vowed she never could abear . It was from this lady , who was very free in her conversation , that Huxter presently learnt what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little Fan , and what had been Pen 's behaviour regarding her . Mrs. Bolton 's account of the transaction was not , it may be imagined , entirely an impartial narrative . One would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girl 's heart , had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman . Huxter , in his present frame of mind respecting Arthur , and suffering under the latter 's contumely , was ready , of course , to take all for granted that was said in the disfavour of this unfortunate convalescent . But why did he not write home to Clavering , as he had done previously , giving an account of Pen 's misconduct , and of the particulars regarding it , which had now come to his knowledge ? He soon , in a letter to his brother - in - law , announced that that nice young man , Mr. Pendennis , had escaped narrowly from a fever , and that no doubt all Clavering , where he was so popular , would be pleased at his recovery ; and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture , an officer of distinction , which kept him in town ; but as for Fanny Bolton , he made no more mention of her in his letters - no more than Pen himself had made mention of her . O you mothers at home , how much do you think you know about your lads ? How much do you think you know ? But with Bows , there was no reason why Huxter should not speak his mind , and so , a very short time after his conversation with Mrs. Bolton , Mr. Sam talked to the musician about his early acquaintance with Pendennis ; described him as a confounded conceited blackguard , and expressed a determination to punch his impudent head as soon as ever he should be well enough to stand up like a man . Then it was that Bows on his part spoke and told his version of the story , whereof Arthur and little Fan were the hero and heroine ; how they had met by no contrivance of the former , but by a blunder of the old Irishman , now in bed with a broken shin - how Pen had acted with manliness and self - control in the business - how Mrs Bolton was an idiot ; and he related the conversation which he , Bows , had had with Pen , and the sentiments uttered by the young man . Perhaps Bow 's story caused some twinges of conscience in the breast of Pen 's accuser , and that gentleman frankly owned that he had been wrong with regard to Arthur , and withdrew his project for punching Mr. Pendennis 's head . But the cessation of his hostility for Pen did not diminish Huxter 's attentions to Fanny , which unlucky Mr Bows marked with his usual jealousy and bitterness of spirit , "
313453	313459	313461	313461	somebody	14677	" the old fellow thought , "
313543	313552	313973	313973	they	10809	" he said , with a bitter laugh ; "
313571	313970	313555	313555	I	0	" This was the selfish way in which Bows looked at the state of affairs : though few persons would have thought there was any cause for his jealousy , who looked at the pale and grief - stricken countenance of the hapless little girl , its object . Fanny received Huxter 's good - natured efforts at consolation and kind attentions kindly . She laughed now and again at his jokes and games with her little sisters , but relapsed quickly into a dejection which ought to have satisfied Mr. Bows that the new - comer had no place in her heart as yet , had jealous Mr. Bows been enabled to see with clear eyes . But Bows did not . Fanny attributed Pen 's silence somehow to Bows 's interference . Fanny hated him . Fanny treated Bows with constant cruelty and injustice . She turned from him when he spoke - she loathed his attempts at consolation . A hard life had Mr. Bows , and a cruel return for his regard . When Warrington came to Shepherd 's Inn as Pen 's ambassador , it was for Mr. Bows 's apartments he inquired no doubt upon a previous agreement with the principal for whom he acted in this delicate negotiation , and he did not so much as catch a glimpse of Miss Fanny when he stopped at the Inn - gate and made his inquiry . Warrington was , of course , directed to the musician 's chambers , and found him tending the patient there , from whose chamber he came out to wait upon his guest . We have said that they had been previously known to one another , and the pair shook hands with sufficient cordiality . After a little preliminary talk , Warrington said that he had come from his friend Arthur Pendennis , and from his family , to thank Bows for his attention at the commencement of Pen 's illness , and for his kindness in hastening into the country to fetch the Major . Bows replied that it was but his duty : he had never thought to have seen the young gentleman alive again when he went in search of Pen 's relatives , and he was very glad of Mr. Pendennis 's recovery , and that he had his friends with him . "
313981	313986	313978	313979	Mr. Warrington	1359	" said the musician . "
314010	314011	313995	313995	nobody	2163	" "
314021	314025	314018	314019	Mr. Bows	833	" Warrington asked . "
314039	314044	314026	314027	The General	14770	" the other answered ; "
314313	314386	314387	314387	I	0	" It was from Mr. Huxter that Bows had learned Pen 's parentage , no doubt , and if he took Pen 's part against the young surgeon , and Fanny 's against Mr. Pendennis , it was because the old gentleman was in so savage a mood , that his humour was to contradict everybody . Warrington was curious , and not ill pleased at the musician 's taunts and irascibility . "
314394	314398	314387	314387	I	0	" he said , "
314464	314465	314453	314454	Mrs. Pendennis	697	" "
314822	314843	314818	314819	my patient	10870	" And a voice was heard from the Captain 's bedroom , a well - known voice , which said , "
314858	314937	314852	314852	Bows	833	" And not sorry , perhaps , to hear that such was the state of things , and that Pen 's forsaken was consoling herself , Warrington took his leave of the irascible musician . As luck would have it , he passed the lodge door just as Mr. Huxter was in the act of frightening the children with the mask whereof we have spoken , and Fanny was smiling languidly at his farces . Warrington laughed bitterly . "
314944	314948	314949	314949	I	0	" he thought . "
314958	315033	314949	314949	I	0	" he added , with a sigh . At Piccadilly , waiting for the Richmond omnibus , George fell in with Major Pendennis , bound in the same direction , and he told the old gentleman of what he had seen and heard respecting Fanny . Major Pendennis was highly delighted : and as might be expected of such a philosopher , made precisely the same observation as that which had escaped from Warrington . "
315040	315044	315034	315035	All women	5627	" he said . "
315160	315161	315153	315153	We	10879	" "
315197	315201	315204	315204	Warrington	1359	" Warrington said . "
315206	315218	315204	315204	Warrington	1359	" said the Major , with a look of some alarm , "
315299	315365	315297	315297	she	1874	" And he sniggered over this gratifying truth , happy in the corner of the omnibus during the rest of the journey . Pen was very anxious to hear from his envoy what had been the result of the latter 's mission ; and as soon as the two young men could be alone , the ambassador spoke in reply to Arthur 's eager queries . "
315378	315382	315368	315368	your	1359	" Warrington said ; "
315393	315394	315395	315395	Apres	1876	" "
315397	315408	315395	315395	Apres	1876	" asked Pen , in a great state of excitement . "
315425	315426	315415	315415	you	1359	" "
315443	315456	315437	315437	You	1359	" cried out Pen , starting up , his face turning red . "
315462	315478	315437	315437	You	1359	" Warrington said , and with two fingers pushed Pen back into his seat again . "
315491	316164	315488	315489	young one	20884	" he said sadly , in reply to the savage flush in Arthur 's face . CHAPTER LVII Foreign Ground Worthy Major Pendennis fulfilled his promise to Warrington so far as to satisfy his own conscience , and in so far to ease poor Helen with regard to her son , as to make her understand that all connexion between Arthur and the odious little gatekeeper was at an end , and that she need have no further anxiety with respect to an imprudent attachment or a degrading marriage on Pen 's part . And that young fellow 's mind was also relieved after he had recovered the shock to his vanity by thinking that Miss Fanny was not going to die of love for him , and that no unpleasant consequences were to be apprehended from the luckless and brief connexion . So the whole party were free to carry into effect their projected Continental trip , and Arthur Pendennis , rentier , voyageant avec Madame Pendennis and Mademoiselle Bell , and George Warrington , particulier , age de 32 ans , taille 6 pieds Anglais , figure ordinaire , cheveux noirs , barbe idem , etc . , procured passports from the consul of H.M. the King of the Belgians at Dover , and passed over from that port to Ostend , whence the party took their way leisurely , visiting Bruges and Ghent on their way to Brussels and the Rhine . It is not our purpose to describe this oft - travelled tour , or Laura 's delight at the tranquil and ancient cities which she saw for the first time , or Helen 's wonder and interest at the Beguine convents which they visited , or the almost terror with which she saw the black - veiled nuns with outstretched arms kneeling before the illuminated altars , and beheld the strange pomps and ceremonials of the Catholic worship . Barefooted friars in the streets ; crowned images of Saints and Virgins in the churches before which people were bowing down and worshipping , in direct defiance , as she held , of the written law ; priests in gorgeous robes , or lurking in dark confessionals ; theatres opened , and people dancing on Sundays , - all these new sights and manners shocked and bewildered the simple country lady ; and when the young men after their evening drive or walk returned to the widow and her adopted daughter , they found their books of devotion on the table , and at their entrance Laura would commonly cease reading some of the psalms or the sacred pages which , of all others , Helen loved . The late events connected with her son had cruelly shaken her ; Laura watched with intense , though hidden anxiety , every movement of her dearest friend ; and poor Pen was most constant and affectionate in waiting upon his mother , whose wounded bosom yearned with love towards him , though there was a secret between them , and an anguish or rage almost on the mother 's part , to think that she was dispossessed somehow of her son 's heart , or that there were recesses in it which she must not or dared not enter . She sickened as she thought of the sacred days of boyhood when it had not been so - when her Arthur 's heart had no secrets , and she was his all in all : when he poured his hopes and pleasures , his childish griefs , vanities , triumphs into her willing and tender embrace ; when her home was his nest still ; and before fate , selfishness , nature , had driven him forth on wayward wings - to range his own flight - to sing his own song - and to seek his own home and his own mate . Watching this devouring care and racking disappointment in her friend , Laura once said to Helen , "
316219	318361	316216	316216	I	0	" - and Helen , sighing , agreed to this portion of the young lady 's speech , though she protested against the former part . For my part I suppose Miss Laura was right in both statements , and with regard to the latter assertion especially , that it is an old and received truism - love is an hour with us : it is all night and all day with a woman . Damon has taxes , sermon , parade , tailors ' bills , parliamentary duties , and the deuce knows what to think of ; Delia has to think about Damon - Damon is the oak or the post and stands up , and Delia is the ivy or the honeysuckle whose arms twine about him . Is it not so , Delia ? Is it not your nature to creep about his feet and kiss them , to twine round his trunk and hang there ; and Damon 's to stand like a British man with his hands in his breeches pocket , while the pretty fond parasite clings round him ? Old Pendennis had only accompanied our friends to the water 's edge , and left them on board the boat , giving the chief charge of the little expedition to Warrington . He himself was bound on a brief visit to the house of a great man , a friend of his , after which sojourn he proposed to join his sister - in - law at the German watering - place , whither the party was bound . The Major himself thought that his long attentions to his sick family had earned for him a little relaxation - and though the best of the partridges were thinned off , the pheasants were still to be shot at Stillbrook , where the noble owner still was ; old Pendennis betook himself to that hospitable mansion and disported there with great comfort to himself . A royal Duke , some foreigners of note , some illustrious statesmen , and some pleasant people visited it : it did the old fellow 's heart good to see his name in the Morning Post amongst the list of the distinguished company which the Marquis of Steyne was entertaining at his country - house at Stillbrook . He was a very useful and pleasant personage in a country - house . He entertained the young men with queer little anecdotes and grivoises stories on their shooting - parties or in their smoking - room , where they laughed at him and with him . He was obsequious with the ladies of a morning , in the rooms dedicated to them . He walked the new arrivals about the park and gardens , and showed them the carte du pays , and where there was the best view of the mansion , and where the most favourable point to look at the lake : he showed , where the timber was to be felled , and where the old road went before the new bridge was built , and the hill cut down ; and where the place in the wood was where old Lord Lynx discovered Sir Phelim O'Neal on his knees before her ladyship , etc . etc . ; he called the lodge - keepers and gardeners by their names ; he knew the number of domestics that sat down in the housekeeper 's room , and how many dined in the servants'-hall ; he had a word for everybody , and about everybody , and a little against everybody . He was invaluable in a country - house , in a word : and richly merited and enjoyed his vacation after his labours . And perhaps whilst he was thus deservedly enjoying himself with his country friends , the Major was not ill pleased at transferring to Warrington the command of the family expedition to the Continent , and thus perforce keeping him in the service of the ladies , - a servitude which George was only too willing to undergo , for his friend 's sake , and for that of a society which he found daily more delightful . Warrington was a good German scholar , and was willing to give Miss Laura lessons in the language , who was very glad to improve herself , though Pen , for his part , was too weak or lazy now to resume his German studies . Warrington acted as courier and interpreter ; Warrington saw the baggage in and out of ships , inns and carriages , managed the money matters , and put the little troop into marching order . Warrington found out where the English church was , and , if Mrs. Pendennis and Miss Laura were inclined to go thither , walked with great decorum along with them . Warrington walked by Mrs. Pendennis 's donkey , when that lady went out on her evening excursions ; or took carriages for her ; or got ' Galignani ' for her ; or devised comfortable seats under the lime - trees for her , when the guests paraded after dinner , and the Kursaal band at the bath , where our tired friends stopped , performed their pleasant music under the trees . Many a fine whiskered Prussian or French dandy , come to the bath for the ' Trente - et - quarante , ' cast glances of longing towards the pretty fresh - coloured English girl who accompanied the pale widow , and would have longed to take a turn with her at the galop or the waltz . But Laura did not appear in the ballroom , except once or twice , when Pen vouchsafed to walk with her ; and as for Warrington , that rough diamond had not had the polish of a dancing - master , and he did not know how to waltz , - though he would have liked to learn , if he could have had such a partner as Laura . - Such a partner ! psha , what had a stiff bachelor to do with partners and waltzing ? what was he about , dancing attendance here ? drinking in sweet pleasure at a risk he knows not of what after - sadness , and regret , and lonely longing ? But yet he stayed on . You would have said he was the widow 's son , to watch his constant care and watchfulness of her ; or that he was an adventurer , and wanted to marry her fortune , or , at any rate , that he wanted some very great treasure or benefit from her , - and very likely he did , - for ours , as the reader has possibly already discovered , is a Selfish Story , and almost every person , according to his nature , more or less generous than George , and according to the way of the world as it seems to us , is occupied about Number One . So Warrington selfishly devoted himself to Helen , who selfishly devoted herself to Pen , who selfishly devoted himself to himself at this present period , having no other personage or object to occupy him , except , indeed , his mother 's health , which gave him a serious and real disquiet ; but though they , sate together , they did not talk much , and the cloud was always between them . Every day Laura looked for Warrington , and received him with more frank and eager welcome . He found himself talking to her as he did n't know himself that he could talk . He found himself performing acts of gallantry which astounded him after the performance : he found himself looking blankly in the glass at the crow 's feet round his eyes , and at some streaks of white in his hair , and some intrusive silver bristles in his grim , blue beard . He found himself looking at the young bucks at the bath - at the bland , tight - waisted Germans - at the capering Frenchmen , with their lacquered mustachios and trim varnished boots - at the English dandies , Pen amongst them , with their calm domineering air , and insolent languor : and envied each one of these some excellence or quality of youth , or good looks , which he possessed , and of which Warrington felt the need . And every night , as the night came , he quitted the little circle with greater reluctance ; and , retiring to his own lodging in their neighbourhood , felt himself the more lonely and unhappy . The widow could not help seeing his attachment . She understood , now , why Major Pendennis always a tacit enemy of her darling project had been so eager that Warrington should be of their party . Laura frankly owned her great , her enthusiastic , regard for him : and Arthur would make no movement . Arthur did not choose to see what was going on ; or did not care to prevent , or actually encouraged , it . She remembered his often having said that he could not understand how a man proposed to a woman twice . She was in torture - at secret feud with her son , of all objects in the world the dearest to her - in doubt , which she dared not express to herself , about Laura - averse to Warrington , the good and generous . No wonder that the healing waters of Rosenbad did not do her good , or that Doctor von Glauber , the bath physician , when he came to visit her , found that the poor lady made no progress to recovery . Meanwhile Pen got well rapidly ; slept with immense perseverance twelve hours out of the twenty - four ; ate huge meals ; and , at the end of a couple of months , had almost got back the bodily strength and weight which he had possessed before his illness . After they had passed some fifteen days at their place of rest and refreshment , a letter came from Major Pendennis announcing his speedy arrival at Rosenbad , and , soon after the letter , the Major himself made his appearance accompanied by Morgan his faithful valet , without whom the old gentleman could not move . When the Major travelled he wore a jaunty and juvenile travelling costume ; to see his back still you would have taken him for one of the young fellows whose slim waist and youthful appearance Warrington was beginning to envy . It was not until the worthy man began to move , that the observer remarked that Time had weakened his ancient knees , and had unkindly interfered to impede the action of the natty little varnished boots in which the gay old traveller still pinched his toes . There were magnates both of our own country and of foreign nations present that autumn at Rosenbad . The elder Pendennis read over the strangers ' list with great gratification on the night of his arrival , was pleased to find several of his acquaintances among the great folks , and would have the honour of presenting his nephew to a German Grand Duchess , a Russian Princess , and an English Marquis , before many days were over : nor was Pen by any means averse to making the acquaintance of these great personages , having a liking for polite life , and all the splendours and amenities belonging to it . That very evening the resolute old gentleman , leaning on his nephew 's arm , made his appearance in the halls of the Kursaal , and lost or won a napoleon or two at the table of ' Trente - et - quarante . ' He did not play to lose , he said , or to win , but he did as other folks did , and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came . He pointed out the Russians and Spaniards gambling for heaps of gold , and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous ; an English gentleman should play where the fashion is play , but should not elate or depress himself at the sport ; and he told how he had seen his friend the Marquis of Steyne , when Lord Gaunt , lose eighteen thousand at a sitting , and break the bank three nights running at Paris , without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory . "
318379	318393	318373	318373	Pen	1844	" the old gentleman said , warming as he prattled about his recollections - "
318412	319174	319175	319175	Everybody	2177	" And as Russian Princesses passed him , whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful , and damaged English ladies , who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation , the old Major , with eager garrulity and mischievous relish , told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines ; and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals . Egad , he felt himself quite young again , he remarked to Pen , as , rouged and grinning , her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl , the Princess Obstropski smiled and recognised and accosted him . He remembered her in ' 14 when she was an actress of the Paris Boulevard , and the Emperor Alexander 's aide - de - camp Obstropski a man of great talents , who knew a good deal about the Emperor Paul 's death , and was a devil to play married her . He most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the Princess , and to present to her his nephew , Mr. Arthur Pendennis ; and he pointed out to the latter a half - dozen of other personages whose names were as famous , and whose histories were as satisfying . What would poor Helen have thought , could she have heard those tales , or known to what kind of people her brother - in - law was presenting her son ? Only once , leaning on Arthur 's arm , she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play , and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of Rouge gagne and Couleur perd . She had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium , imploring Pen , extorting from him a promise , on his word of honour , that he would never play at those tables ; and the scene which so frightened the simple widow , only amused the worldly old veteran , and made him young again ! He could breathe the air cheerfully which stifled her . Her right was not his right : his food was her poison . Human creatures are constituted thus differently , and with this variety the marvellous world is peopled . To the credit of Mr. Pen , let it be said , that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother , and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it . When the Major arrived , his presence somehow cast a damp upon at least three of the persons of our little party - upon Laura who had anything but respect for him ; upon Warrington , whose manner towards him showed an involuntary haughtiness and contempt ; and upon the timid and alarmed widow , who dreaded lest he should interfere with her darling , though almost desperate , projects for her boy . And , indeed , the Major , unknown to himself , was the bearer of tidings which were to bring about a catastrophe in the affairs of all our friends . Pen with his two ladies had apartments in the town of Rosenbad ; honest Warrington had lodgings hard by ; the Major , on arrival at Rosenbad , had , as befitted his dignity , taken his quarters at one of the great hotels , at the Roman Emperor or the Four Seasons , where two or three hundred gamblers , pleasure - seekers , or invalids , sate down and over - ate themselves daily at the enormous table - d'hote . To this hotel Pen went on the morning after the Major 's arrival , dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle , and found the latter 's sitting - room duly prepared and arranged by Mr. Morgan , with the Major 's hats brushed , and his coats laid out : his despatch - boxes and umbrella - cases , his guidebooks , passports , maps , and other elaborate necessaries of the English traveller , all as trim and ready as they could be in their master 's own room in Jermyn Street . Everything was ready , from the medicine - bottle fresh filled from the pharmacien 's , down to the old fellow 's prayer - book , without which he never travelled , for he made a point of appearing at the English church at every place which he honoured with a stay "
319179	319183	319175	319175	Everybody	2177	" he said ; "
319190	319393	319184	319186	every English gentleman	10893	" and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the English ambassador in a Continental town , as of not showing himself at the national place of worship . The old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which Rosenbad is famous , and which everybody takes , and his after - bath toilet was not yet completed when Pen arrived . The elder called out to Arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment , in which he and Morgan were engaged , and the valet presently came in , bearing a little packet to Pen 's address - Mr. Arthur 's letters and papers , Morgan said , which he had brought from Mr. Arthur 's chambers in London , and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the Pall Mall Gazette , which our friend Mr. Finucane thought his collaborateur would like to see . The papers were tied together : the letters in an envelope , addressed to Pen , in the last - named gentleman 's handwriting . Amongst the letters there was a little note addressed , as a former letter we have heard of had been , to "
319399	319732	319394	319395	Arther Pendennis	1866	" which Arthur opened with a start and a blush , and read with a very keen pang of interest , and sorrow , and regard . She had come to Arthur 's house , Fanny Bolton said - and found that he was gone - gone away to Germany without ever leaving a word for her - or answer to her last letter , in which she prayed but for one word of kindness - or the books which he had promised her in happier times , before he was ill , and which she should like to keep in remembrance of him . She said she would not reproach those who had found her at his bedside when he was in the fever , and knew nobody , and who had turned the poor girl away without a word . She thought she should have died , she said , of that , but Doctor Goodenough had kindly tended her , and kept her life , when , perhaps , the keeping of it was of no good , and she forgave everybody and as for Arthur , she would pray for him for ever . And when he was so ill , and they cut off his hair , she had made so free as to keep one little lock for herself , and that she owned . And might she still keep it , or would his mamma order that that should be gave up too ? She was willing to obey him in all things , and could n't but remember that once he was so kind , oh ! so good and kind ! to his poor Fanny . When Major Pendennis , fresh and smirking from his toilet , came out of his bedroom to his sitting - room , he found Arthur , with this note before him , and an expression of savage anger on his face , which surprised the elder gentleman . "
319741	319747	319749	319750	the duns	17393	" he rather faintly asked ; "
319759	319760	319749	319750	the duns	17393	" "
319771	319775	319762	319762	you	0	" Arthur asked . "
319783	319796	319779	319781	my good sir	15568	" said the other dryly , at once perceiving what had happened . "
319818	319823	319809	319810	Fanny Bolton	986	" Arthur broke out . "
319875	319876	319869	319869	you	0	" "
319896	319911	319869	319869	you	0	" Major Pendennis cried out , in a great tremor of emotion and indignation . "
319959	319960	319950	319950	Gad	945	" "
319969	319974	319950	319950	Gad	945	" Arthur said hotly - "
320019	320020	320012	320012	you	2261	" "
320030	320035	320021	320021	I	0	" the uncle said , "
320069	320070	320074	320075	my mother	2288	" "
320080	320085	320074	320075	my mother	2288	" Arthur broke out . "
320095	320096	320097	320097	I	0	" "
320107	320113	320097	320097	I	0	" the elder said testily . "
320124	320125	320126	320126	I	0	" "
320136	320152	320130	320134	the person who did it	10916	" said Arthur , bouncing up and seizing his hat . The Major cried out , "
320164	320200	320155	320155	Arthur	739	" but before he had uttered his sentence Arthur had rushed out of the room , and at the next minute the Major saw him striding rapidly down the street that led towards his home . "
320204	320227	320228	320229	Poor Helen	1896	" said the old fellow to Morgan , and he wagged his head and sighed as he looked out of the window . "
320255	320342	320346	320346	Warrington	1359	" When Pen reached home he only found Warrington in the ladies ' drawing - room , waiting their arrival in order to conduct them to the room where the little English colony at Rosenbad held their Sunday church . Helen and Laura had not appeared as yet ; the former was ailing , and her daughter was with her . Pen 's wrath was so great that he could not defer expressing it . He flung Fanny 's letter across the table to his friend . "
320348	320414	320346	320346	Warrington	1359	" he said ; ' she tended me in my illness , she rescued me out of the jaws of death , and this is the way they have treated the dear little creature . They have kept her letters from me ; they have treated me like a child , and her like a dog , poor thing ! My mother has done this . "
320415	320428	320429	320429	Warrington	1359	" If she has , you must remember it is your mother , "
320432	320450	320451	320451	Pen	1844	" It only makes the crime the greater , because it is she who has done it , "
320454	320527	320451	320451	Pen	1844	" She ought to have been the poor girl 's defender , not her enemy : she ought to go down on her knees and ask pardon of her . I ought ! I will ! I am shocked at the cruelty which has been shown her . What ? She gave me her all , and this is her return ! She sacrifices everything for me , and they spurn her . "
320528	320531	320533	320533	Warrington	1359	" Hush ! "
320535	320545	320533	320533	Warrington	1359	" they can hear you from the next room . "
320546	320553	320554	320554	Pen	1844	" Hear ? let them hear ! "
320564	320598	320554	320554	Pen	1844	" Those may overhear my talk who intercept my letters . I say this poor girl has been shamefully used , and I will do my best to right her ; I will . "
320633	320642	320643	320643	she	741	" Arthur , your mother is very ill , "
320646	320662	320643	320643	she	741	" it is a pity that you should speak so loud as to disturb her . "
320663	320679	320680	320680	Pen	1844	" It is a pity that I should have been obliged to speak at all , "
320683	320695	320680	320680	Pen	1844	" And I have more to say before I have done . "
320696	320714	320715	320715	Laura	741	" I should think what you have to say will hardly be fit for me to hear , "
320720	320734	320736	320737	Mr. Pen	10919	" You are welcome to hear it or not , as you like , "
320739	320751	320752	320752	Laura	741	" I shall go in now and speak to my mother . "
320769	320775	320776	320776	she	741	" Not now , sir , "
320781	320801	320776	320776	she	741	" You may kill her if you do . Your conduct has gone far enough to make her wretched . "
320802	320806	320809	320809	Pen	1844	" What conduct ? "
320815	320838	320809	320809	Pen	1844	" Who dares impugn it ? Who dares meddle with me ? Is it you who are the instigator of this persecution ? "
320839	320860	320861	320861	Laura	741	" I said before it was a subject of which it did not become me to hear or to speak , "
320864	320914	320861	320861	Laura	741	" But as for mamma , if she had acted otherwise than she did with regard to - to the person about whom you seem to take such an interest , it would have been I that must have quitted your house , and not that - that person . "
320915	320924	320925	320925	Pen	1844	" By heavens ! this is too much , "
320934	320942	320943	320943	Laura	741	" Perhaps that is what you wished , "
320951	320975	320947	320947	her	741	" No more of this , if you please ; I am not accustomed to hear such subjects spoken of in such language , "
321147	321156	321157	321157	she	741	" And it was to this hardened libertine , "
321160	321176	321157	321157	she	741	" to this boaster of low intrigues , that I had given my heart away . "
321177	321185	321187	321187	Helen	1844	" He breaks the most sacred laws , "
321189	321231	321187	321187	Helen	1844	" He prefers the creature of his passion to his own mother ; and when he is upbraided , he laughs , and glories in his crime . ' She gave me her all , ' I heard him say it , "
321237	321254	321187	321187	Helen	1844	" and he boasts of it , and laughs , and breaks his mother 's heart . "
321286	321294	321282	321282	Laura	741	" Perhaps that is what you wished . "
321295	321301	321302	321302	he	1359	" She loves Pen still , "
321305	321313	321302	321302	he	1359	" It was jealousy made her speak . "
321315	321371	321302	321302	he	1359	" Come away , Pen . Come away , and let us go to church and get calm . You must explain this matter to your mother . She does not appear to know the truth : nor do you quite , my good fellow . Come away , and let us talk about it . "
321379	321428	321374	321374	he	1359	" ' Perhaps that is what you wished . ' Yes , she loves him . Why should n't she love him ? Whom else would I have her love ? What can she be to me but the dearest and the fairest and the best of women ? "
321458	321466	321468	321469	honest George	1359	" I must set this matter right , "
321470	321488	321468	321469	honest George	1359	" as she loves him still - I must set his mind right about the other woman . "
321921	321929	321915	321915	He	1897	" Perhaps that is what you wished , "
321966	321970	321971	321973	Our poor widow	10948	" Fairoaks to let "
322257	322262	322263	322263	he	2245	" She persecutes me , "
322268	322281	322263	322263	he	2245	" and she comes to me with the air of a martyr ! "
322282	322291	322292	322292	she	10953	" You look very ill , my child , "
322295	322308	322310	322310	she	10953	" I do n't like to see you look in that way . "
322330	322341	322342	322342	Pen	1844	" I have had much to annoy me , mother , "
322393	322401	322402	322402	Arthur	697	" I have had letters from London , "
322405	322469	322402	322402	Arthur	697	" and one that has given me more pain than I ever had in my life . It tells me that former letters of mine have been intercepted and purloined away from me ; - that - that a young creature who has shown the greatest love and care for me , has been most cruelly used by - by you , mother . "
322470	322477	322480	322480	Warrington	1359	" For God 's sake stop , "
322482	322495	322480	322480	Warrington	1359	" She 's ill - do n't you see she is ill ? "
322496	322502	322504	322505	the widow	13904	" Let him go on , "
322509	322518	322520	322520	Laura	741	" Let him go on and kill her , "
322530	322541	322520	322520	Laura	741	" Speak on , sir , and see her die . "
322542	322550	322552	322552	Pen	1844	" It is you who are cruel , "
322586	322735	322552	322552	Pen	1844	" It is you that are cruel , who attribute all this pain to me : it is you who are cruel with your wicked reproaches , your wicked doubts of me , your wicked persecutions of those who love me , - yes , those who love me , and who brave everything for me , and whom you despise and trample upon because they are of lower degree than you . Shall I tell you what I will do , - what I am resolved to do , now that I know what your conduct has been ? - I will go back to this poor girl whom you turned out of my doors , and ask her to come back and share my home with me . I 'll defy the pride which persecutes her , and the pitiless suspicion which insults her and me . "
322736	322747	322766	322766	her	10965	" Do you mean , Pen , that you - - "
322768	322776	322777	322777	she	741	" Silence , hush , dear mother , "
322804	322815	322818	322818	she	10965	" Go on , Arthur , go on , Arthur , "
322828	322850	322851	322852	the Major	2155	" By Gad , I say he sha n't go on , or I wo n't hear him , by Gad , "
322861	323101	322851	322852	the Major	2155	" If you choose , sir , after all we 've done for you , after all I 've done for you myself , to insult your mother and disgrace your name , by allying yourself with a low - born kitchen - girl , go and do it , by Gad , - but let us , ma'am , have no more to do with him . I wash my hands of you , sir , - I wash my hands of you . I 'm an old fellow , - I ai n't long for this world . I come of as ancient and honourable a family as any in England , by Gad , and I did hope , before I went off the hooks , by Gad , that the fellow that I 'd liked , and brought up , and nursed through life , by Jove , would do something to show me that our name - yes , the name of Pendennis , by Gad , was left undishonoured behind us , but if he wo n't , dammy , I say , amen . By G - , both my father and my brother Jack were the proudest men in England , and I never would have thought that there would come this disgrace to my name , - never - and - and I 'm ashamed that it 's Arthur Pendennis . "
323231	323246	323247	323247	he	1359	" Will you let me tell you something about myself , my kind friends ? "
323251	323385	323247	323247	he	1359	" you have been so good to me , ma'am , you have been so kind to me , Laura - I hope I may call you so sometimes - my dear Pen and I have been such friends that I have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is , and would have told it to you earlier but that it is a sad one and contains another 's secret . However , it may do good for Arthur to know it - it is that every one here should . It will divert you from thinking about a subject , which , out of a fatal misconception , has caused a great deal of pain to all of you . May I please tell you , Mrs. Pendennis ? "
323386	323390	323393	323393	Helen	1844	" Pray speak , "
323455	323466	323467	323467	he	1359	" You all of you know how you see me , "
323470	323846	323467	323467	he	1359	" a man without a desire to make an advance in the world : careless about reputation ; and living in a garret and from hand to mouth , though I have friends and a name , and I daresay capabilities of my own , that would serve me if I had a mind . But mind I have none . I shall die in that garret most likely , and alone . I nailed myself to that doom in early life . Shall I tell you what it was that interested me about Arthur years ago , and made me inclined towards him when first I saw him ? The men from our college at Oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the Chatteris actress , about whom Pen has talked to me since ; and who , but for the Major 's generalship , might have been your daughter - in - law , ma'am . I ca n't see Pen in the dark , but he blushes , I 'm sure ; and I dare say Miss Bell does ; and my friend Major Pendennis , I dare say , laughs as he ought to do - for he won . What would have been Arthur 's lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself , with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other , no equality , no confidence , and no love speedily ? What could he have been but most miserable ? And when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union , be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger , which you must give me leave to say , ma'am , was very natural on his part , for after a generous and manly conduct - let me say who know the circumstances well - most generous and manly and self - denying which is rare with him , - he has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion , and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person , towards whom he and you all are under much obligation . "
323867	323875	323857	323857	Warrington	1359	" Do I tire you , ma'am ? "
323876	323886	323888	323888	Helen	1844	" Oh no - go on - go on , "
323896	323975	323976	323976	he	1359	" I liked him , you see , because of that early history of his , which had come to my ears in college gossip , and because I like a man , if you will pardon me for saying so , Miss Laura , who shows that he can have a great unreasonable attachment for a woman . That was why we became friends - and are all friends here - for always , are n't we ? "
323989	324006	323976	323976	he	1359	" and Pen has been a great comfort and companion to a lonely and unfortunate man . "
324101	324216	324217	324217	My	0	" Here there came a sigh from somewhere near Warrington in the dark , and a hand was held out in his direction , which , however , was instantly , withdrawn , for the prudery of our females is such , that before all expression of feeling , or natural kindness and regard , a woman is ' taught to think of herself and the proprieties , and to be ready to blush at the very slightest notice ; ' and checking , as , of course , it ought , this spontaneous motion , modesty drew up again , kindly friendship shrank back ashamed of itself , and Warrington resumed his history . "
324238	324352	324217	324217	My	0	" I , too , had an adventure before I went to college ; and there was no one to save me as Major Pendennis saved Pen . Pardon me , Miss Laura , if I tell this story before you . It is as well that you all of you should hear my confession . Before I went to college , as a boy of eighteen , I was at a private tutor 's , and there , like Arthur , I became attached , or fancied I was attached , to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own . You shrink from me - - "
324353	324360	324361	324361	Laura	741	" No , I do n't , "
324401	324412	324413	324413	Warrington	1359	" She was a yeoman 's daughter in the neighbourhood , "
324422	324525	324413	324413	Warrington	1359	" and I fancied - what all young men fancy . Her parents knew who my father was , and encouraged me , with all sorts of coarse artifices and scoundrel flatteries , which I see now , about their house . To do her justice , I own she never cared for me , but was forced into what happened by the threats and compulsion of her family . Would to God that I had not been deceived : but in these matters we are deceived because we wish to be so , and I thought I loved that poor woman . "
324626	324864	324873	324874	the Major	2155	" At my father 's death , I paid what debts I had contracted at college , and settled every shilling which remained to me in an annuity upon - upon those who bore my name , on condition that they should hide themselves away , and not assume it . They have kept that condition , as they would break it , for more money . If I had earned fame or reputation , that woman would have come to claim it : if I had made a name for myself those who no right to it would have borne it ; and I entered life at twenty , God help me - hopeless and ruined beyond remission . I was the boyish victim of vulgar cheats , and , perhaps , it is only of late I have found out how hard - ah , how hard - it is to forgive them . I told you the moral before , Pen ; and now I have told you the fable . Beware how you marry out of your degree . I was made for a better lot than this , I think : but God has awarded me this one - and so , you see , it is for me to look on , and see others successful and others happy , with a heart that shall be as little bitter as possible . "
324865	324871	324873	324874	the Major	2155	" By Gad , sir , "
324882	324892	324873	324874	the Major	2155	" I intended you to marry Miss Laura here . "
324893	324909	324910	324910	Warrington	1359	" And , by Gad , Master Shallow , I owe you a thousand pound , "
324913	324928	324930	324931	the Major	2155	" How d'ye mean a thousand ? it was only a pony , sir , "
324957	324971	324950	324950	she	10989	" God bless you - God for ever bless you , Mr. Warrington ; "
324990	324996	324997	324997	he	10990	" Yes , dearest mother , "
325019	325036	324997	324997	he	10990	" I am innocent , and my dear , dear mother has done me a wrong . "
325037	325057	325058	325058	Helen	1844	" Oh yes , my child , I have wronged you , thank God , I have wronged you ! "
325061	325102	325103	325103	He	10991	" Come away , Arthur - not here - I want to ask my child to forgive me - and - and my God , to forgive me ; and to bless you , and love you , my son . "
325644	325649	325632	325632	her	2237	" for ever and ever "
325651	325654	325632	325632	her	2237	" Amen . "
325679	325684	325672	325672	Arthur	697	" Laura ! Laura ! "
325732	325739	325740	325740	he	1844	" Help , Laura , help ! "
325752	326085	325740	325740	he	1844	" Laura screamed , and fell by the side of Helen . The shriek brought Warrington and Major Pendennis and the servants to the room . The sainted woman was dead . The last emotion of her soul here was joy to be henceforth unchequered and eternal . The tender heart beat no more ; it was to have no more pangs , no more doubts , no more griefs and trials . Its last throb was love ; and Helen 's last breath was a benediction . The melancholy party bent their way speedily homewards , and Helen was laid by her husband 's side at Clavering , in the old church where she had prayed so often . For a while Laura went to stay with Dr. Portman , who read the service over his dear departed sister , amidst his own sobs and those of the little congregation which assembled round Helen 's tomb . There were not many who cared for her , or who spoke of her when gone . Scarcely more than of a nun in a cloister did people know of that pious and gentle lady . A few words among the cottagers whom her bounty was accustomed to relieve , a little talk from house to house at Clavering , where this lady told how their neighbour died of a complaint in the heart ; whilst that speculated upon the amount of a property which the widow had left ; and a third wondered whether Arthur would let Fairoaks or live in it , and expected that he would not be long getting through his property , - this was all , and except with one or two who cherished her , the kind soul was forgotten by the next market - day . Would you desire that grief for you should last for a few more weeks ? and does after - life seem less solitary , provided that our names , when we "
326091	326161	325740	325740	he	1844	" are echoing on this side of the grave yet for a little while , and human voices are still talking about us ? She was gone , the pure soul , whom only two or three loved and knew . The great blank she left was in Laura 's heart , to whom her love had been everything , and who had now but to worship her memory . "
326176	326570	326166	326166	she	11024	" Warrington said to Pen ; and as for Arthur , with a humble acknowledgment and wonder at so much affection , he hardly dared to ask of Heaven to make him worthy of it , though he felt that a saint there was interceding for him . All the lady 's affairs were found in perfect order , and her little property ready for transmission to her son , in trust for whom she held it . Papers in her desk showed that she had long been aware of the complaint , one of the heart , under which she laboured , and knew that it would suddenly remove her : and a prayer was found in her handwriting , asking that her end might be , as it was , in the arms of her son . Laura and Arthur talked over her sayings , all of which the former most fondly remembered , to the young man 's shame somewhat , who thought how much greater her love had been for Helen than his own . He referred himself entirely to Laura to know what Helen would have wished should be done ; what poor persons she would have liked to relieve ; what legacies or remembrances she would have wished to transmit . They packed up the vase which Helen in her gratitude had destined to Dr. Goodenough , and duly sent it to the kind Doctor ; a silver coffee - pot , which she used , was sent off to Portman : a diamond ring , with her hair , was given with affectionate greeting to Warrington . It must have been a hard day for poor Laura when she went over to Fairoaks first and to the little room which she had occupied , and which was hers no more , and to the widow 's own blank chamber in which those two had passed so many beloved hours . There , of course , were the clothes in the wardrobe , the cushion on which she prayed , the chair at the toilette : the glass that was no more to reflect her dear sad face . After she had been here a while Pen knocked and led her downstairs to the parlour again , and made her drink a little wine , and said , "
326575	326582	326166	326166	she	11024	" as she touched the glass . "
326592	326596	326600	326600	your	11025	" he said - "
326619	326624	326617	326617	Laura	741	" and Laura said , "
326627	326643	326617	326617	Laura	741	" Among the widow 's papers was found a packet , marked by the widow , "
326650	326836	326837	326838	Dear Fanny	1899	" and which Arthur gave to her . They were the letters which had passed between the cousins in the early days before the marriage of either of them . The ink was faded in which they were written : the tears dried out that both perhaps had shed over them : the grief healed now whose bitterness they chronicled : the friends doubtless united whose parting on earth had caused to both pangs so cruel . And Laura learned fully now for the first time what the tie was which had bound her so tenderly to Helen : how faithfully her more than mother had cherished her father 's memory , how truly she had loved him , how meekly resigned him . One legacy of his mother 's Pen remembered , of which Laura could have no cognisance . It was that wish of Helen 's to make some present to Fanny Bolton ; and Pen wrote to her , putting his letter under an envelope to Mr. Bows , and requesting that gentleman to read it before he delivered it to Fanny . "
326840	326844	326837	326838	Dear Fanny	1899	" Pen said , "
326862	326886	326837	326838	Dear Fanny	1899	" Pen found the first letter in his mother 's desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang , "
326989	327127	326970	326970	she	13874	" Pen concluded by saying that his friend , George Warrington , Esq . , of Lamb Court , Temple , was trustee of a little sum of money , of which the interest would be paid to her until she became of age , or changed her name , which would always be affectionately remembered by her grateful friend , A. Pendennis . The sum was in truth but small , although enough to make a little heiress of Fanny Bolton , whose parents were appeased , and whose father said Mr. P. had acted quite as the gentleman - though Bows growled out that that to plaster a wounded heart with a banknote was an easy kind of sympathy ; and poor Fanny felt only too clearly that Pen 's letter was one of farewell . "
327142	327173	326970	326970	she	13874	" old Major Pendennis said to his nephew whom , as thee proprietor of Fairoaks and the head of the family , he now treated with marked deference and civility , "
327494	327495	327496	327496	Warrington	1359	" "
327521	327525	327527	327527	you	1359	" Arthur replied . "
327582	327583	327584	327584	I	0	" "
327605	327816	327584	327584	I	0	" Arthur replied : at which the Major pish'd and psha'd , and said that there ought to be convents , begad , for English ladies , and wished that Miss Bell had not been there to interfere with the arrangements of the family , and that she would mope herself to death alone in that place . Indeed , it would have been a very dismal abode for poor Laura , who was not too happy either in Dr. Portman 's household , and in the town where too many things reminded her of the dear parent whom she had lost . But old Lady Rockminster , who adored her young friend Laura , as soon as she read in the paper of her loss , and of her presence in the country , rushed over from Baymouth , where the old lady was staying , and insisted that Laura should remain six months , twelve months , all her life with her ; and to her ladyship 's house , Martha from Fairoaks , as femme de chambre , accompanied her young mistress . Pen and Warrington saw her depart . It was difficult to say which of the young men seemed to regard her the most tenderly . "
327837	327850	327829	327829	he	5297	" little Lady Rockminster said , who said her say about everybody - "
327866	327867	327861	327861	he	5297	" "
327876	327884	327868	327869	Mr. Warrington	1359	" Laura said , dropping her eyes . "
327914	327915	327905	327905	you	14151	" "
327934	328212	327905	327905	you	14151	" She could not finish the sentence . The carriage passed over the bridge , and by the dear , dear gate of Fairoaks - home no more . CHAPTER LIX Old Friends It chanced at that great English festival , at which all London takes a holiday upon Epsom Downs , that a great number of the personages to whom we have been introduced in the course of this history , were assembled to see the Derby . In a comfortable open carriage , which had been brought to the ground by a pair of horses , might be seen Mrs. Bungay , of Paternoster Row , attired like Solomon in all his glory , and having by her side modest Mrs. Shandon , for whom , since the commencement of their acquaintance , the worthy publisher 's lady had maintained a steady friendship . Bungay , having recreated himself with a copious luncheon , was madly shying at the sticks hard by , till the perspiration ran off his bald pate . Shandon was shambling about among the drinking tenants and gipsies : Finucane constant in attendance on the two ladies , to whom gentlemen of their acquaintance , and connected with the publishing house , came up to pay a visit . Among others , Mr. Archer came up to make her his bow , and told Mrs. Bungay who was on the course . Yonder was the Prime Minister : his lordship had just told him to back Borax for the race ; but Archer thought Munmeer the better horse . He pointed out countless dukes and grandees to the delighted Mrs. Bungay . "
328220	328224	327905	327905	you	14151	" he said . "
328412	328413	328436	328437	The cook	14456	" "
328416	328421	328436	328437	The cook	14456	" said Mrs. Bungay . "
328527	328528	328529	328529	You	11091	" "
328537	328545	328529	328529	You	11091	" cried the astonished publisher 's lady . "
328652	328653	328649	328650	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" "
328667	328673	328674	328674	He	1043	" Mrs. Bungay presently asked . "
328735	328736	328726	328726	He	1043	" "
328768	328773	328782	328783	Mr. A.	1043	" said Mr. Archer . "
328785	328793	328794	328794	I	0	" cried the lady of Paternoster Row . "
328811	328816	328800	328800	I	0	" Mr. Archer replied . "
328889	328890	328886	328887	Lord Rochester	1907	" "
328894	328903	328891	328892	Lord Fiddlestick	1908	" cried out Finucane , from the box . "
328917	328918	328915	328915	Archer	1436	" "
328922	328928	328915	328915	Archer	1436	" Archer said , simply . "
328978	328979	328975	328976	Sir James	1910	" "
328991	328995	328984	328984	you	1436	" growled Finucane . "
329015	329019	329000	329000	they	11118	" Archer continued . "
329130	329131	329126	329126	Wellington	975	" "
329159	329164	329157	329157	gentlemen	13913	" asked Mrs. Bungay . "
329295	329296	329292	329293	a keeper	11139	" "
329304	329309	329299	329301	that young fellow	23118	" sighed Mrs. Bungay . "
329380	329381	329382	329382	I	0	" "
329396	329401	329382	329382	I	0	" Mr. Archer said , "
329448	329588	329445	329446	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" An hour previous to this time , and at a different part of the course , there might have been seen an old stage - coach , on the battered roof of which a crowd of shabby raffs were stamping and hallooing , as the great event of the day - the Derby race - rushed over the greensward , and by the shouting millions of people assembled to view that magnificent scene . This was Wheeler 's the Harlequin 's Head drag , which had brought down a company of choice spirits from Bow Street , with a slap - up luncheon in the boot . As the whirling race flashed by , each of the choice spirits bellowed out the name of the horse or the colours which he thought or he hoped might be foremost . "
329592	329593	329445	329446	Mrs. Shandon	1481	" "
329598	329599	329439	329440	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" "
329605	329606	329439	329440	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" "
329616	329738	329439	329440	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" and so forth , yelled the gentlemen sportsmen during that delicious and thrilling minute before the contest was decided ; and as the fluttering signal blew out , showing the number of the famous horse Podasokus as winner of the race , one of the gentlemen on the Harlequin 's Head drag sprang up off the roof , as if he was a pigeon and about to fly away to London or York with the news . But his elation did not lift him many inches from his standing - place , to which he came down again on the instant , causing the boards of the crazy old coach - roof to crack with the weight of his joy . "
329743	329748	329439	329440	Mrs. Bungay	1469	" he bawled out , "
329775	329793	329795	329795	you	2615	" And the gentlemen on the carriage , the shabby swaggerers , the dubious bucks , said , "
329808	329815	329804	329804	you	2615	" and whispered to one another , "
329836	330230	329825	329825	he	18794	" And each of the shabby bucks and dusky dandies began to eye his neighbour with suspicion , lest that neighbour , taking his advantage , should get the Colonel into a lonely place and borrow money of him . And the winner on Podasokus could not be alone during the whole of that afternoon , so closely did his friends watch him and each other . At another part of the course you might have seen a vehicle certainly more modest , if not more shabby than that battered coach which had brought down the choice spirits from the Harlequin 's Head ; this was cab No . 2002 , which had conveyed a gentleman and two ladies from the cabstand in the Strand : whereof one of the ladies , as she sate on the box of the cab enjoying with her mamma and their companion a repast of lobster salad and bitter ale , looked so fresh and pretty that many of the splendid young dandies who were strolling about the course , and enjoying themselves at the noble diversion of Sticks , and talking to the beautifully dressed ladies in the beautiful carriages , on the hill , forsook these fascinations to have a glance at the smiling and rosy - cheeked lass on the cab . The blushes of youth and good - humour mantled on the girl 's cheeks , and played over that fair countenance like the pretty shining cloudlets on the serene sky overhead ; the elder lady 's cheek was red too ; but that was a permanent mottled rose , deepening only as it received free draughts of pale ale and brandy - and - water , until her face emulated the rich shell of the lobster which she devoured . The gentleman who escorted these two ladies was most active in attendance upon them : here on the course , as he had been during the previous journey . During the whole of that animated and delightful drive from London , his jokes had never ceased . He spoke up undauntedly to the most awful drags full of the biggest and most solemn guardsmen ; as to the humblest donkey - chaise in which Bob the dustman was driving Molly to the race . He had fired astonishing volleys of what is called "
330232	330320	330329	330329	He	896	" into endless windows as he passed ; into lines of grinning girls ' schools ; into little regiments of shouting urchins hurraying behind the railings of their Classical and Commercial Academies ; into casements whence smiling maid - servants , and nurses tossing babies , or demure old maiden ladies with dissenting countenances , were looking . And the pretty girl in the straw bonnet with pink ribbon , and her mamma the devourer of lobsters , had both agreed that when he was in ' spirits "
331278	331316	331271	331271	Fanny	986	" This is Mr. Samuel Huxter whom you knew formerly , I believe , sir ; Mr. Samuel , you know you knew Mr. Pendennis formerly - and - and , will you take a little refreshment ? "
331390	331396	331397	331397	he	739	" I am very thirsty , "
331400	331454	331397	331397	he	739	" and I will be glad to drink your health , Fanny ; and I hope Mr. Huxter will pardon me for having been very rude to him the last time we met , and when I was so ill and out of spirits , that indeed I scarcely knew what I said . "
331811	331817	331818	331818	Fanny	986	" What a beautiful creature ! "
331821	331840	331818	331818	Fanny	986	" What a lovely dress ! Did you remark , Mr. Sam , such little , little hands ? "
331841	331847	331849	331850	Mrs. Bolton	842	" It was Capting Strong , "
331852	331863	331849	331850	Mrs. Bolton	842	" and who was the young woman , I wonder ? "
331864	331878	331879	331879	Arthur	739	" A neighbour of mine in the country - Miss ' Amory , ' "
331883	331903	331879	331879	Arthur	739	" Lady Clavering 's daughter . You 've seen Sir Francis often in Shepherd 's Inn , Mrs. Bolton . "
332293	332331	332288	332289	Mrs. Bolton	842	" Come , come , Mr. H. - no nonsense , if you please ; and I think you 've acted like a wicked wretch , and been most uncommon cruel to Fanny , that I do . "

332632	332682	332626	332626	Pen	1865	" Hone suit qui mal y peens . My young friend , yonder , is as well protected as any young lady in Christendom . She has her mamma on one side , her pretend on the other . Could any harm happen to a girl between those two ? "
332683	332695	332697	332698	Miss Blanche	1236	" One does not know what may or may not arrive , "
332703	332770	332697	332698	Miss Blanche	1236	" when a girl has the mind , and when she is pursued by a wicked monster like you . Figure to yourself , Major , that I come to find Monsieur , your nephew , near to a cab , by two ladies , and a man , oh , such a man ! and who ate lobsters , and who laughed , who laughed ! "
332771	332782	332783	332783	Pen	1865	" It did not strike me that the man laughed , "
332786	332851	332783	332783	Pen	1865	" And as for lobsters , I thought he would have liked to eat me after the lobsters . He shook hands with me , and gripped me so , that he bruised my glove black - and - blue . He is a young surgeon . He comes from Clavering . Do n't you remember the gilt pestle and mortar in High Street ? "
332852	332862	332864	332865	Miss Amory	1236	" If he attends you when you are sick , "
332867	332885	332864	332865	Miss Amory	1236	" he will kill you . He will serve you right ; for you are a monster . "

332975	332991	332992	332992	Blanche	1236	" Of what are you thinking ? Are you going to bouder me at present ? "
332995	333019	332992	332992	Blanche	1236	" Major , scold your mechant nephew . He does not amuse me at all . He is as bete as Captain Crackenbury . "

333040	333066	333033	333034	the guardsman	11244	" If it 's anything good , say it in English , for I do n't understand French when it 's spoke so devilish quick . "

333085	333105	333082	333083	Captain Clinker	693	" Let 's come away , and do n't spoil sport . They say Pendennis is sweet upon her . "
333106	333117	333119	333119	Crackenbury	1921	" I 'm told he 's a devilish clever fellow , "
333121	333174	333119	333119	Crackenbury	1921	" Lady Violet Lebas says he 's a devilish clever fellow . He wrote a work , or a poem , or something ; and he writes those devilish clever things in the - in the papers , you know . Dammy , I wish I was a clever fellow , Clinker . "

333251	333263	333265	333266	Captain Crackenbury	1921	" Clavering 's safe to pay up , ai n't he ? "
333268	333273	333275	333276	his friend	14540	" I hope so , "
333407	333414	333415	333416	one man	8092	" How easily she takes it ! "
333421	333429	333430	333431	the friend	6647	" The Begum 's made of money , "

333446	333453	333443	333444	old Pendennis	693	" Has anybody lost any money ? "
333506	333522	333494	333495	the Begum	7688	" Why did n't he come before ? Why did n't he come to lunch ? "
333578	333601	333603	333603	he	1589	" He would go and look after the horses and those rascals of postillions , who were so long in coming round . "

333803	333885	333887	333889	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" must be . Strong sat on the box still , with a lordly voice calling to the post - boys and the crowd . Master Frank had been put inside of the carriage and was asleep there by the side of the Major , dozing away the effects of the constant luncheon and champagne of which he had freely partaken . The Major was revolving in his mind meanwhile the news the receipt of which had made him so grave . "
333896	333902	333887	333889	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" Pendennis the elder thought , "
333967	333968	333971	333971	you	11283	" "
333983	333988	333971	333971	you	11283	" Miss Amory asked . "
334052	334053	334177	334177	Ma	2728	" "
334057	334061	334177	334177	Ma	2728	" said mamma . "

334082	334173	334174	334174	I	0	" Major Pendennis answered , with such a rueful face , that the Begum rallied him , and asked laughingly whether he had lost money on the race ? After a slumber of about an hour and a half , the heir of the house began to exhibit symptoms of wakefulness , stretching his youthful arms over the Major 's face , and kicking his sister 's knees as she sate opposite to him . When the amiable youth was quite restored to consciousness , he began a sprightly conversation . "
334179	334183	334174	334174	I	0	" he said , "
334196	334197	334193	334193	I	0	" "

334361	334379	334350	334350	I	0	" The Begum expressed her desire to hear this something , and her son and heir continued : "
334476	334477	334478	334479	Captain Strong	1225	" "
334488	334495	334481	334482	Captain Strong	1225	" cried out the unfortunate Begum . "
334521	334552	334510	334510	He	1000	" Strong , from his place on the box , had overheard the end of young Clavering 's communication , and was trying in vain to stop his unlucky tongue . "
334562	334569	334553	334553	I	0	" he said , turning round , "
334604	334778	334597	334597	he	1000	" Lady Clavering at this sad news burst into a fit of tears . She deplored her wretched fate as the most miserable of women , she declared she would separate , and pay no more debts for the ungrateful man . She narrated with tearful volubility a score of stories only too authentic , which showed how her husband had deceived , and how constantly she had befriended him : and in this melancholy condition , whilst young Hopeful was thinking about the two guineas which he himself had won ; and the Major revolving , in his darkened mind , whether certain plans which he had been forming had better not be abandoned ; the splendid carriage drove up at length to the Begum 's house in Grosvenor Place ; the idlers and boys lingering about the place to witness , according to public wo nt , the close of the Derby Day , cheering the carriage as it drew up , and envying the happy folks who descended from it . "
334795	334814	334816	334817	this cheat	11305	" Blanche said , quivering with anger , as she walked upstairs leaning on the Major 's arm - "
334833	334834	334836	334836	yourself	0	" "
334843	334849	334836	334836	yourself	0	" the old gentleman said ; "
334888	335546	335547	335547	I	0	" And the young lady , and the heir of the hopeful house of Clavering , having retired to their beds , the remaining three of the Epsom party remained for some time in deep consultation . CHAPTER LX Explanations Almost a year , as the reader will perceive , has passed since an event described a few pages back . Arthur 's black coat is about to be exchanged for a blue one . His person has undergone other more pleasing and remarkable changes . His wig has been laid aside , and his hair , though somewhat thinner , has returned to public view . And he has had the honour of appearing at Court in the uniform of a Cornet of the Clavering troop of the - - shire Yeomanry Cavalry , being presented to the Sovereign by the Marquis of Steyne . This was a measure strongly and pathetically urged by Arthur 's uncle . The Major would not hear of a year passing before this ceremony of gentlemanhood was gone through . The old gentleman thought that his nephew should belong to some rather more select Club than the Megatherium ; and has announced everywhere in the world his disappointment that the young man 's property has turned out not by any means as well as he could have hoped , and is under fifteen hundred a year . That is the amount at which Pendennis 's property is set down in the world - where his publishers begin to respect him much more than formerly , and where even mammas are by no means uncivil to him . For if the pretty daughters are , naturally , to marry people of very different expectations - at any rate , he will be eligible for the plain ones : and if the brilliant and fascinating Myra is to hook an Earl , poor little Beatrice , who has one shoulder higher than the other , must hang on to some boor through life , and why should not Mr. Pendennis be her support ? In the very first winter after the accession to his mother 's fortune , Mrs. Hawxby in a country - house caused her Beatrice to learn billiards from Mr. Pendennis and would be driven by nobody but him in the pony carriage , because he was literary and her Beatrice was literary too , and declared that the young man , under the instigation of his horrid old uncle , had behaved most infamously in trifling with Beatrice 's feelings . The truth is the old gentleman , who knew Mrs. Hawxby 's character , and how desperately that lady would practise upon unwary young men , had come to the country - house in question and carried Arthur out of the danger of her immediate claws , though not out of the reach of her tongue . The elder Pendennis would have had his nephew pass a part of the Christmas at Clavering , whither the family had returned ; but Arthur had not the heart for that . Clavering was too near poor old Fairoaks ; and that was too full of sad recollections for the young man . We have lost sight of the Claverings , too , until their reappearance upon the Epsom race - ground , and must give a brief account of them in the interval . During the past year , the world has not treated any member of the Clavering family very kindly ; Lady Clavering , one of the best - natured women that ever enjoyed a good dinner , or made a slip in grammar , has had her appetite and good - nature sadly tried by constant family grievances , and disputes such as make the efforts of the best French cook unpalatable , and the most delicately - stuffed sofa - cushion hard to lie on . "
335572	335594	335570	335570	Clavering	693	" says poor Lady Clavering , looking at her dinner - table , and confiding her grief to her faithful friend , "
335630	335689	335700	335702	Sir Francis Clavering	693	" The Clavering family had indeed made a false start in life , and had got neither conduct , nor position , nor thanks for the hospitalities which they administered , nor a return of kindness from the people whom they entertained . The success of their first London season was doubtful ; and their failure afterwards notorious . "
335704	335708	335709	335709	He	11314	" people said . "
335935	335945	335910	335910	she	1218	" She had not the slightest ill - will towards "
335949	336010	335910	335910	she	1218	" the poor dear lady , or any pride about herself , or idea , that she was better than her neighbour ; but she had taken implicitly the orders which on her entry into the world her social godmother had given her : she had been willing to know whom they knew , and ask whom they asked . The "
336013	336027	335910	335910	she	1218	" in fact , was much pleasanter than what is called ' society ; "
336447	336451	336471	336471	his	801	" valuable information , "
336947	336956	336957	336957	he	2155	" Interested motives , my dear Lady Clavering , "
336960	336996	336957	336957	he	2155	" of course I may have had . We all have interested motives , and mine , I do n't conceal from you , was to make a marriage between my nephew and your daughter . "
337033	337474	337030	337030	he	2155	" My dear lady , my boy has but five hundred a year , and a wife with ten thousand pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him . We could do better for him than that , permit me to say , and he is a shrewd , cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats now - who has very good parts and plenty of ambition - and whose object in marrying is to better himself . If you and Sir Francis chose - and Sir Francis , take my word for it , will refuse you nothing - you could put Arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world , and show the stuff which he has in him . Of what use is that seat in Parliament to Clavering , who scarcely ever shows his face in the House , or speaks a word there ? I 'm told by gentlemen who heard my boy at Oxbridge , that he was famous as an orator , begad ! - and once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him , I 've no doubt he wo n't be the last of the field , ma'am . I 've tested the chap , and know him pretty well , I think . He is much too lazy , and careless , and flighty a fellow , to make a jog - trot journey , and arrive , as your lawyers do , at the end of their lives ! but give him a start and good friends , and an opportunity , and take my word for it , he 'll make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of . I do n't see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir , but by making a prudent marriage - not with a beggarly heiress - to sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a year - but with somebody whom he can help , and who can help him forward in the world , and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country , begad , in return for the advantages which she brings him . It would be better for you to have a distinguished son - in - law , than to keep your husband on in Parliament , who 's of no good to himself or to anybody else there , and that 's , I say , why I 've been interested about you , and offer you what I think a good bargain for both . "
337475	337490	337492	337496	the good - natured Begum	1576	" You know I look upon Arthur as one of the family almost now , "
337498	337636	337492	337496	the good - natured Begum	1576	" he comes and goes when he likes ; and the more I think of his dear mother , the more I see there 's few people so good - none so good to me . And I 'm sure I cried when I heard of her death , and would have gone into mourning for her myself , only black do n't become me . And I know who his mother wanted him to marry - Laura , I mean - whom old Lady Rockminster has taken such a fancy to , and , no wonder . She 's a better girl than my girl . I know both . And my Betsy - Blanche , I mean - ai n't been a comfort to me , Major . It 's Laura Pen ought to marry . "
337653	337658	337649	337649	you	11387	" Major Pendennis said . "
337693	337754	337686	337687	old Pendennis	693	" For some time previous , Pen 's uncle had held similar language to Miss Amory . He had pointed out to her the convenience of the match which he had at heart , and was bound to say , that mutual convenience was of all things the very best in the world to marry upon - the only thing . "
337918	338153	337898	337898	they	11401	" As for Miss Amory , she was contented enough with Pen as long as there was nobody better . And how many other young ladies are like her ? - and how many love - marriages carry on well to the last ? - and how sentimental firms do not finish in bankruptcy ? - and how many heroic passions do n't dwindle down into despicable indifference , or end in shameful defeat ? These views of life and philosophy the Major was constantly , according to his custom , inculcating to Pen , whose mind was such that he could see the right on both sides of many questions , and , comprehending the sentimental life which was quite out of the reach of the honest Major 's intelligence , could understand the practical life too , and accommodate himself , or think he could accommodate himself , to it . So it came to pass that during the spring succeeding his mother 's death he became a good deal under the influence of his uncle 's advice , and domesticated in Lady Clavering 's house ; and in a measure was accepted by Miss Amory without being a suitor , and was received without being engaged . The young people were extremely familiar , without being particularly sentimental , and met and parted with each other in perfect good - humour . "
338157	338161	338155	338155	I	0	" thought Pendennis , "
338185	339379	339380	339380	She	11405	" Yes , it was the same Pendennis , and time had brought to him , as to the rest of us , its ordinary consequences , consolations , developments . We alter very little . When we talk of this man or that woman being no longer the same person whom we remember in youth , and remark of course to deplore changes in our friends , we do n't , perhaps , calculate that circumstance only brings out the latent defect or quality , and does not create it . The selfish languor and indifference of to - day 's possession is the consequence of the selfish ardour of yesterday 's pursuit : the scorn and weariness which cries vanitas vanitatum is but the lassitude of the sick appetite palled with pleasure : the insolence of the successful parvenu is only the necessary continuance of the career of the needy struggler : our mental changes are like our grey hairs or our wrinkles - but the fulfilment of the plan of mortal growth and decay : that which is snow - white now was glossy black once ; that which is sluggish obesity to - day was boisterous rosy health a few years back ; that calm weariness , benevolent , resigned , and disappointed , was ambition , fierce and violent , but a few years since , and has only settled into submissive repose after many a battle and defeat . Lucky he who can bear his failure so generously , and give up his broken sword to Fate the Conqueror with a manly and humble heart ! Are you not awestricken , you , friendly reader , who , taking the page up for a moment 's light reading , lay it down , perchance , for a graver reflection , - to think how you , who have consummated your success or your disaster , may be holding marked station , or a hopeless and nameless place , in the crowd - who have passed through how many struggles of defeat , success , crime , remorse , to yourself only known ! - who may have loved and grown cold , wept and laughed again , how often ! - to think how you are the same , You , whom in childhood you remember , before the voyage of life began ? It has been prosperous , and you are riding into port , the people huzzaing and the guns saluting , - and the lucky captain bows from the ship 's side , and there is a care under the star on his breast which nobody knows of : or you are wrecked , and lashed , hopeless , to a solitary spar out at sea : - the sinking man and the successful one are thinking each about home , very likely , and remembering the time when they were children ; alone on the hopeless spar , drowning out of sight ; alone in the midst of the crowd applauding you . CHAPTER LXI Conversations Our good - natured Begum was at first so much enraged at this last instance of her husband 's duplicity and folly , that she refused to give Sir Francis Clavering any aid in order to meet his debts of honour , and declared that she would separate from him , and leave him to the consequences of his incorrigible weakness and waste . After that fatal day 's transactions at the Derby , the unlucky gambler was in such a condition of mind that he was disposed to avoid everybody ; alike his turf - associates with whom he had made the debts which he trembled lest he should not have the means of paying , and his wife , his long - suffering banker , on whom he reasonably doubted whether he should be allowed any longer to draw . When Lady Clavering asked the next morning whether Sir Francis was in the house , she received answer that he had not returned that night , but had sent a messenger to his valet , ordering him to forward clothes and letters by the bearer . Strong knew that he should have a visit or a message from him in the course of that or the subsequent day , and accordingly got a note beseeching him to call upon his distracted friend F. C. at Short Hotel , Blackfriars , and ask for Mr. Francis there . For the Baronet was a gentleman of that peculiarity of mind that he would rather tell a lie than not , and always began a contest with fortune by running away and hiding himself . The Boots of Mr. Short 's establishment , who carried Clavering 's message to Grosvenor Place , and brought back his carpet - bag , was instantly aware who was the owner of the bag , and he imparted his information to the footman who was laying the breakfast - table , who carried down the news to the servants'-hall , who took it to Mrs. Bonner , my lady 's housekeeper and confidential maid , who carried it to my lady . And thus every single person in the Grosvenor Place establishment knew that Sir Francis was in hiding , under the name of Francis , at an inn in the Blackfriars Road . And Sir Francis 's coachman told the news to other gentlemen 's coachmen , who carried it to their masters , and to the neighbouring Tattersall 's , where very gloomy anticipations were formed that Sir Francis Clavering was about to make a tour in the Levant . In the course of that day the number of letters addressed to Sir Francis Clavering , Bart . , which found their way to his hall - table , was quite remarkable . The French cook sent in his account to my lady ; the tradesmen who supplied her ladyship 's table , and Messrs. Finer and Gimcrack , the mercers and ornamental dealers , and Madame Crinoline , the eminent milliner , also forwarded their little bills to her ladyship , in company with Miss Amory 's private , and by no means inconsiderable , account at each establishment . In the afternoon of the day after the Derby , when Strong after a colloquy with his principal at Short 's Hotel , whom he found crying and drinking Curacoa called to transact business according to his custom at Grosvenor Place , he found all these suspicious documents ranged in the Baronet 's study ; and began to open them and examine them with a rueful countenance . Mrs. Bonner , my lady 's maid and housekeeper , came down upon him whilst engaged in this occupation . Mrs. Bonner , a part of the family and as necessary to her mistress as the Chevalier was to Sir Francis , was of course on Lady Clavering 's side in the dispute between her and her husband , and as by duty bound even more angry than her ladyship herself . "
339391	339396	339386	339386	she	11405	" Mrs. Bonner said . "
339594	339700	339714	339714	he	11422	" Susan Bonner 's mistress hearing of Strong 's arrival sent for him at this juncture , and the Chevalier went up to her ladyship not without hopes that he should find her more tractable than her factotum Mrs. Bonner . Many a time before had he pleaded his client 's cause with Lady Clavering and caused her good - nature to relent . He tried again once more . He painted in dismal colours the situation in which he had found Sir Francis : and would not answer for any consequences which might ensue if he could not find means of meeting his engagements . "
339704	339709	339714	339714	he	11422	" laughed Mrs. Bonner , "
339725	339753	339721	339721	he	11422	" Strong vowed that he had found him with the razors on the table ; but at this , in her turn , Lady Clavering laughed bitterly . "
339807	339808	339809	339809	He	11422	" "
339817	339829	339809	339809	He	11422	" cried out my lady 's aide - de - camp . "
339947	339987	339939	339939	we	11435	" The Chevalier saw from the words which Mrs. Bonner had let slip regarding the diamonds , that the kind Begum was disposed to relent once more at least , and that there were hopes still for his principal . "
339994	340036	339939	339939	we	11435	" he said , with a real feeling of sympathy for Lady Clavering 's troubles , and admiration for her untiring good - nature , and with a show of enthusiasm which advanced not a little his graceless patron 's cause - "
340158	340159	340148	340148	I	0	" "
340164	340169	340148	340148	I	0	" said Mrs. Bonner . "
340176	340181	340182	340182	He	11438	" cried out Strong . "
340317	340318	340319	340319	He	11438	" "
340331	340336	340319	340319	He	11438	" said Mrs. Bonner - "
340349	340350	340344	340344	he	11438	" "
340362	340377	340360	340360	Clavering	693	" Strong said to his principal , when he recounted this scene to him , "
340410	340411	340400	340400	I	0	" "
340415	340443	340400	340400	I	0	" cried Mr. Francis , to whom his ambassador brought the news back at Short 's Hotel , where Strong found the Baronet crying and drinking curacoa . "
340454	340459	340447	340447	you	11452	" burst out Strong . "
340511	340512	340500	340500	I	0	" "
340517	340521	340500	340500	I	0	" gasped Clavering . "
340552	340553	340545	340545	he	663	" "
340561	340566	340568	340568	him	663	" shrieked out Clavering . "
340573	340574	340568	340568	him	663	" "
340590	340621	340585	340585	you	11452	" said Strong , with a sneer , puffing his cigar . The Baronet dashed his weak hand against his forehead ; perhaps the other had interpreted his wish rightly . "
340626	340630	340624	340624	Strong	1225	" he cried , "
340677	340696	340709	340709	thieves	11464	" and he drank , with a trembling hand , a bumper of his fortifier - the curacoa , "
340826	340912	340802	340802	Gad	945	" And so with more tears , shrieks , and curses , the impotent wretch vented his grief and deplored his unhappy fate ; and , in the midst of groans and despair and blasphemy , vowed his miserable repentance . The honoured proverb which declares that to be an ill wind which blows good to nobody , was verified in the case of Sir Francis Clavering , and another of the occupants of Mr. Strong 's chambers in Shepherd 's Inn . The man was "
340915	341087	340802	340802	Gad	945	" by a lucky hap , with whom Colonel Altamont made his bet ; and on the settling day of the Derby - as Captain Clinker , who was appointed to settle Sir Francis Clavering 's book for him for Lady Clavering by the advice of Major Pendennis , would not allow the Baronet to liquidate his own money transactions , paid over the notes to the Baronet 's many creditors - Colonel Altamont had the satisfaction of receiving the odds of thirty to one in fifties , which he had taken against the winning horse of the day . Numbers of the Colonel 's friends were present on the occasion to congratulate him on his luck - all Altamont 's own set , and the gents who met in the private parlour of the convivial Wheeler , my host of the Harlequin 's Head , came to witness their comrade 's good fortune , and would have liked , with a generous sympathy for success , to share in it . "
341093	341102	340802	340802	Gad	945	" Tom Driver had suggested to the Colonel , "
341134	341135	341136	341137	The Tredyddlums	1939	" "
341159	341247	341255	341255	Colonel	1314	" Mr. Keightley insinuated ; and Jack Holt pressed forward his tobacco - smuggling scheme , the audacity of which pleased the Colonel more than any other of the speculations proposed to him . Then of the Harlequin 's Head boys : there was Jack Rackstraw , who knew of a pair of horses which the Colonel must buy ; Tom Fleet , whose satirical paper , The Swell , wanted but two hundred pounds of capital to be worth a thousand a year to any man - "
341271	341372	341255	341255	Colonel	1314	" Tom urged ; whilst little Moss Abiams entreated the Colonel not to listen to these absurd fellows with their humbugging speculations , but to invest his money in some good bills which Moss could get for him , and which would return him fifty per cent as safe as the Bank of England . Each and all of these worthies came round the Colonel with their various blandishments ; but he had courage enough to resist them , and to button up his notes in the pocket of his coat , and go home to Strong , and ' sport "
341502	341534	341535	341536	a friend	14252	" of a Regent Street haberdasher 's window . And a short time after this , upon her birthday , which happened in the month of June , Miss Amory received from "
341537	341716	342098	342099	Sir Francis	693	" a parcel containing an enormous brass inlaid writing - desk , in which there was a set of amethysts , the most hideous eyes ever looked upon , - a musical snuff - box , and two Keepsakes of the year before last , and accompanied with a couple of gown pieces of the most astounding colours , the receipt of which goods made the Sylphide laugh and wonder immoderately . Now it is a fact that Colonel Altamont had made a purchase of cigars and French silks from some duffers in Fleet Street about this period ; and he was found by Strong in the open Auction Room in Cheapside , having invested some money in two desks , several pairs of richly - plated candlesticks , a dinner epergne , and a bagatelle - board . The dinner epergne remained at chambers , and figured at the banquets there , which the Colonel gave pretty freely . It seemed beautiful in his eyes , until Jack Holt said it looked as if it had been taken "
341721	342095	342098	342099	Sir Francis	693	" And Jack Holt certainly knew . The dinners were pretty frequent at chambers , and Sir Francis Clavering condescended to partake of them constantly . His own house was shut up : the successor of Mirobolant , who had sent in his bills so prematurely , was dismissed by the indignant Lady Clavering : the luxuriance of the establishment was greatly pruned and reduced . One of the large footmen was cashiered , upon which the other gave warning , not liking to serve without his mate , or in a family where on'y one footman was kep ' . General and severe economical reforms were practised by the Begum in her whole household , in consequence of the extravagance of which her graceless husband had been guilty . The Major , as her ladyship 's friend ; Strong , on the part of poor Clavering ; her ladyship 's lawyer , and the honest Begum herself , executed these reforms with promptitude and severity . After paying the Baronet 's debts , the settlement of which occasioned considerable public scandal , and caused the Baronet to sink even lower in the world 's estimation than he had been before , Lady Clavering quitted London for Tunbridge Wells in high dudgeon , refusing to see her reprobate husband , whom nobody pitied . Clavering remained in London patiently , by no means anxious to meet his wife 's just indignation , and sneaked in and out of the House of Commons , whence he and Captain Raff and Mr. Marker would go to have a game at billiards and a cigar or showed in the sporting public - houses ; or might be seen lurking about Lincoln 's Inn and his lawyers ' , where the principals kept him for hours waiting , and the clerks winked at each other , as he sate in their office . No wonder that he relished the dinners at Shepherd 's Inn , and was perfectly resigned there : resigned ? he was so happy nowhere else ; he was wretched amongst his equals , who scorned him - but here he was the chief guest at the table , where they continually addressed him with "
342100	342102	342105	342106	Sir Francis	693	" and "
342108	342213	342105	342106	Sir Francis	693	" where he told his wretched jokes , and where he quavered his dreary little French song , after Strong had sung his Jovial chorus , and honest Costigan had piped his Irish ditties . Such a jolly menage as Strong 's , with Grady 's Irish - stew , and the Chevalier 's brew of punch after dinner , would have been welcome to many a better man than Clavering , the solitude of whose great house at home frightened him , where he was attended only by the old woman who kept the house , and his valet who sneered at him . "
342218	342229	342105	342106	Sir Francis	693	" said he to his friends in Shepherd 's Inn , "
342460	342660	342458	342458	valets	7488	" He was very kind to Altamont now : he listened to the Colonel 's loud stories when Altamont described how - when he was working his way home once from New Zealand , where he had been on a whaling expedition - he and his comrades had been obliged to slink on board at night , to escape from their wives , by Jove - and how the poor devils put out in their canoes when they saw the ship under sail , and paddled madly after her : how he had been lost in the bush once for three months in New South Wales , when he was there once on a trading speculation : how he had seen Boney at Saint Helena , and been presented to him with the rest of the officers of the Indiaman of which he was a mate - to all these tales and over his cups Altamont told many of them ; and , it must be owned , lied and bragged a great deal Sir Francis now listened with great attention ; making a point of drinking wine with Altamont at dinner and of treating him with every distinction . "
342675	342688	342668	342668	he	11491	" Altamont said , laughing to Strong , who remonstrated with him , "
343036	343067	343068	343068	You	11503	" Here he burst out into a wild laugh , at which Strong got up and put away the brandy - bottle . The other still laughed good - humouredly . "
343075	343079	343068	343068	You	11503	" he said ; "
343128	343129	343108	343108	I	0	" "
343136	343142	343134	343134	Altamont	1314	" Strong said , gravely , "
343174	343306	343307	343307	They	11512	" The event for which , with cynical enjoyment , Altamont had been on the look - out , came very speedily . One day , Strong being absent upon an errand for his principal , Sir Francis made his appearance in the chambers , and found the envoy of the Nawaub alone . He abused the world in general for being heartless and unkind to him : he abused his wife for being ungenerous to him ; he abused Strong for being ungrateful - hundreds of pounds had he given Ned Strong - been his friend for life and kept him out of gaol , by Jove , - and now Ned was taking her ladyship 's side against him and abetting her in her infernal unkind treatment of him . "
343320	343325	343326	343326	they	11512	" the Baronet said : "
343341	343342	343326	343326	they	11512	" "
343358	343367	343368	343368	He	11514	" Altamont broke out with a savage laugh . "
343387	343388	343385	343385	he	11514	" "
343401	343405	343393	343393	I	0	" Clavering said . "
343580	343599	343600	343601	the other	14365	" Cry a little ; do n't mind cryin ' before me - it 'll relieve you Clavering , "
343604	343634	343600	343601	the other	14365	" Why , I say , old feller , what a happy feller I once thought you , and what a miserable son of a gun you really are ! "
343635	343650	343651	343651	Clavering	693	" It 's a shame that they treat me so , ai n't it ? "
343679	343788	343668	343669	the Baronet	15718	" And - and , by Gad , sir , I have n't got the money to pay the very cab that 's waiting for me at the door ; and the porteress , that Mrs. Bolton , lent me three shillin 's , and I do n't like to ask her for any more : and I asked that d - - d old Costigan , the confounded old penniless Irish miscreant , and he had n't got a shillin ' , the beggar ; and Campion 's out of town , or else he 'd do a little bill for me , I know he would . "
343789	343810	343817	343817	his	1330	" I thought you swore on your honour to your wife that you would n't put your name to paper , "
343820	343840	343843	343844	the Baronet	15718	" Why does she leave me without pocket - money , then ? Damme , I must have money , "
343846	343865	343843	343844	the Baronet	15718	" Oh , Am - - , oh , Altamont , I 'm the most miserable beggar alive . "
343866	343886	343887	343888	the other	14365	" You 'd like a chap to lend you a twenty - pound note , would n't you now ? "
343891	343912	343914	343914	Clavering	693	" If you would , I 'd be grateful to you for ever - for ever , my dearest friend , "
343916	343944	343946	343946	Altamont	1330	" How much would you give ? Will you give a fifty - pound bill , at six months , for half down and half in plate ? "
343948	343967	343969	343969	Clavering	693	" Yes , I would , so help me - - , and pay it on the day , "
343971	343989	343969	343969	Clavering	693	" I 'll make it payable at my banker 's : I 'll do anything you like . "
343990	344006	344015	344015	Clavering	693	" Well , I was only chaffing you . I 'll give you twenty pound . "
344007	344013	344015	344015	Clavering	693	" You said a pony , "
344017	344067	344015	344015	Clavering	693	" my dear fellow , you said a pony , and I 'll be eternally obliged to you ; and I 'll not take it as a gift - only as a loan , and pay you back in six months . I take my oath , I will . "
344068	344307	344015	344015	Clavering	693	" Well - well - there 's the money , Sir Francis Clavering . I ai n't a bad fellow . When I 've money in my pocket , dammy , I spend it like a man . Here 's five - and - twenty for you . Do n't be losing it at the hells now . Do n't be making a fool of yourself . Go down to Clavering Park , and it 'll keep you ever so long . You need n't ' ave butchers ' meat : there 's pigs , I dare say , on the premises : and you can shoot rabbits for dinner , you know , every day till the game comes in . Besides , the neighbours will ask you about to dinner , you know , sometimes : for you are a Baronet , though you have outrun the constable . And you 've got this comfort , that I 'm off your shoulders for a good bit to come - p'raps this two years - if I do n't play ; and I do n't intend to touch the confounded black and red : and by that time my lady , as you call her - Jimmy , I used to say - will have come round again ; and you 'll be ready for me , you know , and come down handsomely to yours truly . "
344389	344415	344416	344417	Sir Francis	693	" And yet I 've looked over the house , Morgan , and I do n't thin he has took any more of the things , "
344436	344608	344416	344417	Sir Francis	693	" My lady locked up a'most all the bejews afore she went away , and he could n't take away the picters and looking - glasses in a cab and he would n't spout the fenders and fire - irons - he ai n't so bad as that . But he 's got money somehow . He 's so dam'd imperent when he have . A few nights ago I sor him at Vauxhall , where I was a - polkin with Lady Hemly Babewood 's gals - a wery pleasant room that is , and an uncommon good lot in it , hall except the ' ousekeeper , and she 's methodisticle - I was a - polkin - you 're too old a cove to polk , Mr. Morgan - and ' ere 's your ' ealth - and I ' appened to ' ave on some of Clavering 's abberdashery , and he sor it too : and he did n't dare so much as speak a word . "
344609	344620	344621	344622	Mr. Morgan	820	" How about the house in St. John 's Wood ? "
344625	344678	344621	344622	Mr. Morgan	820	" Execution in it . - Sold up heverythin : ponies , and pianna , and brougham , and all . Mrs. Montague were hoff to Boulogne , - non est inwentus , Mr. Morgan . It 's my belief she put the execution in herself : and was tired of him . "
344679	344683	344685	344685	Morgan	820	" Play much ? "
344687	344832	344685	344685	Morgan	820	" Not since the smash . When your Governor , and the lawyers , and my lady and him had that tremendous scene : he went down on his knees , my lady told Mrs. Bonner , as told me , - and swear as he never more would touch a card or a dice , or put his name to a bit of paper ; and my lady was a - goin' to give him the notes down to pay his liabilities after the race : only your Governor said which he wrote it on a piece of paper , and passed it across the table to the lawyer and my lady that some one else had better book up for him , for he 'd have kep ' some of the money . He 's a sly old cove , your Gov'nor . "
344836	344840	344685	344685	Morgan	820	" old cove , "
344924	345128	345139	345140	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" Do n't call Major Pendennis an old cove , if you 'll ' ave the goodness , Lightfoot , and do n't call me an old cove , nether . Such words ai n't used in society ; and we have lived in the fust society , both at ' ome and foring . We 've been intimate with the fust statesmen of Europe . When we go abroad we dine with Prince Metternitch and Louy Philup reg'lar . We go here to the best houses , the tip - tops , I tell you . We ride with Lord John and the noble Whycount at the edd of Foring Affairs . We dine with the Hearl of Burgrave , and are consulted by the Marquis of Steyne in everythink . We ought to know a thing or two , Mr. Lightfoot . You 're a young man , I 'm an old cove , as you say . We 've both seen the world , and we both know that it ai n't money , nor bein ' a Baronet , nor ' avin ' a town and country ' ouse , nor a paltry five or six thousand a year . "
345129	345137	345139	345140	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" It 's ten , Mr. Morgan , "
345146	345154	345155	345155	Morgan	820	" It may have been , sir , "
345162	345374	345155	345155	Morgan	820	" it may have been , Mr. Lightfoot , but it ai n't six now , nor five , sir . It 's been doosedly dipped and cut into , sir , by the confounded extravygance of your master , with his helbow shakin ' , and his bill discountin ' , and his cottage in the Regency Park , and his many wickednesses . He 's a bad un , Mr. Lightfoot , - a bad lot , sir , and that you know . And it ai n't money , sir - not such money as that , at any rate , come from a Calcuttar attorney , and I dussay wrung out of the pore starving blacks - that will give a pusson position in society , as you know very well . We 've no money , but we go everywhere ; there 's not a housekeeper 's room , sir , in this town of any consiquince , where James Morgan ai n't welcome . And it was me who got you into this Club , Lightfoot , as you very well know , though I am an old cove , and they would have blackballed you without me as sure as your name is Frederic . "
345375	345384	345386	345387	the other	14365	" I know they would , Mr. Morgan , "

It ai n't gentlemanlike , Frederic Lightfoot , which I knew you when you was a cab - boy , and when your father was in trouble , and got you the place you have now when the Frenchman went away . And if you think , sir , that because you 're making up to Mrs. Bonner , who may have saved her two thousand pound - and I dare say she has in five - and - twenty years as she have lived confidential maid to Lady Clavering - yet , sir , you must remember who put you into that service ; and who knows what you were before , sir , and it do n't become you , Frederic Lightfoot , to call me an old cove .

345541	345576	345155	345155	Morgan	820	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Morgan - I ca n't do more than make an apology - will you have a glass , sir , and let me drink your ' ealth ? "
345577	345588	345590	345590	Morgan	820	" You know I do n't take sperrits . Lightfoot , "
345594	345611	345590	345590	Morgan	820	" And so you and Mrs. Bonner is going to put up together , are you ? "
345612	345678	345386	345387	the other	14365	" She 's old , but two thousand pound 's a good bit , you see , Mr Morgan . And we 'll get the ' Clavering Arms ' for a very little ; and that 'll be no bad thing when the railroad runs through Clavering . And when we are there , I hope you 'll come and see us , Mr. Morgan . "
345679	345690	345692	345693	Mr. Morgan	820	" It 's a stoopid place , and no society , "
345695	345724	345692	345693	Mr. Morgan	820	" I know it well . In Mrs Pendennis 's time we used to go down , reg'lar , and the hair refreshed me after the London racket . "
345725	345735	345737	345737	Lightfoot	1245	" The railroad will improve Mr. Arthur 's property , "
345739	345754	345737	345737	Lightfoot	1245	" What 's about the figure of it , should you say , sir ? "
345755	345762	345764	345764	Morgan	820	" Under fifteen hundred , sir , "
345793	345803	345804	345804	Lightfoot	1245	" Is his man any good , Mr. Morgan ? "
345807	345842	345844	345844	Morgan	820	" Pidgeon ai n't used to society as yet ; but he 's young and has good talents , and has read a good deal , and I dessay he will do very well , "
345846	345869	345844	345844	Morgan	820	" He would n't quite do for this kind of thing , Lightfoot , for he ai n't seen the world yet . "
345962	346003	345948	345948	he	820	" What d'you think about Miss Amory , Lightfoot - tell us in confidence , now - Do you think we should do well - you understand - if we make Miss A. into Mrs. A. P. , comprendy vous ? "
346004	346014	346016	346017	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" She and her Ma 's always quarrellin ' , "
346019	346388	346016	346017	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" Bonner is more than a match for the old lady , and treats Sir Francis like that - like this year spill , which I fling into the grate . But she dare n't say a word to Miss Amory . No more dare none of us . When a visitor comes in , she smiles and languishes , you 'd think that butter would n't melt in her mouth : and the minute he is gone , very likely , she flares up like a little demon , and says things fit to send you wild . If Mr. Arthur comes , it 's ' Do let 's sing that there delightful Song ! ' or , ' Come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum ! ' and very likely she 's been a - rilin ' her mother , or sticking pins into her maid , a minute before . She do stick pins into her and pinch her . Mary Hann showed me one of her arms quite black and blue ; and I recklect Mrs. Bonner , who 's as jealous of me as a old cat , boxed her ears for showing me . And then you should see Miss at luncheon , when there 's nobody but the family ! She makes b'leave she never heats , and my ! you should only jest see her . She has Mary Hann to bring her up plum - cakes and creams into her bedroom ; and the cook 's the only man in the house she 's civil to . Bonner says , how , the second season in London , Mr. Soppington was a - goin' to propose for her , and actially came one day , and sor her fling a book into the fire , and scold her mother so , that he went down softly by the back droring - room door , which he came in by ; and next thing we heard of him was , he was married to Miss Rider . Oh , she 's a devil , that little Blanche , and that 's my candig apinium , Mr. Morgan . "
346389	346401	346402	346403	Mr. Morgan	820	" Apinion , not apinium , Lightfoot , my good fellow , "
346804	346833	346834	346835	The Colonel	18794	" Sir Robert , Lady , and the Misses Hodge ; Mr. Serjeant Kewsy , and Mrs. and Miss Kewsy ; Colonel Altamont , Major Coddy , etc . "

He has pluck and honesty in his way . He will stick to a friend , and face an enemy . The other never had courage to do either . And what is it that has put the poor devil under a cloud ? He was only a little wild , and signed his father - in - law 's name . Many a man has done worse , and come to no wrong , and holds his head up . Clavering does . No , he do n't hold his head up : he never did in his best days . "

And dammy , I owe my man Lightfoot fourteen pound now which he 's lent and paid for me : and he duns me - the confounded impudent blackguard : and I wish to Heaven I knew any way of getting a bill done , or of screwing a little out of my lady ! I 'll give you half , Ned , upon my soul and honour , I 'll give you half if you can get anybody to do us a little fifty . "

' There is no need , sir , for you to brag that your father was a - a medical man . He came of a most ancient but fallen house , and was obliged to reconstruct the family fortunes as many a man of good family has done before him . You are like the fellow in Sterne , sir - the Marquis who came to demand his sword again . Your father got back yours for you . You are a man of landed estate , by Gad , sir , and a gentleman - never forget you are a gentleman . "
349840	349870	349871	349871	he	1968	" In the society which I have the honour of frequenting through your introduction , who cares to ask about my paltry means or my humble gentility , uncle ? "
349874	349911	349871	349871	he	1968	" It would be absurd of me to attempt to compete with the great folks ; and all that they can ask from us is , that we should have a decent address and good manners . "
349912	349930	349931	349932	the uncle	2890	" But for all that , sir , I should belong to a better Club or two , "

350225	350315	350222	350222	George	1359	" about those people . The young men laugh and talk freely before those ladies , and about them . The girl sees people whom she has no right to know , and talks to men with whom no girl should have an intimacy . Did you see those two reprobates leaning over Lady Clavering 's carriage in the Park the other day , and leering under Miss Blanche 's bonnet ? No good mother would let her daughter know those men , or admit them within her doors . "

350397	350479	350388	350388	Warrington	1865	" Would you let any woman you loved be contaminated by their company ? I have no doubt that the poor Begum is ignorant of their histories . It seems to me she is ignorant of a great number of better things . It seems to me that your honest Begum is not a lady , Pen . It is not her fault , doubtless , that she has not had the education , or learned the refinements of a lady . "
350480	350522	350523	350523	Pen	1865	" She is as moral as Lady Portsea , who has all the world at her balls , and as refined as Mrs. Bull , who breaks the King 's English . and has half a dozen dukes at her table , "
350529	350672	350523	350523	Pen	1865	" Why should you and I be more squeamish than the rest of the world ? Why are we to visit the sins of her father on this harmless kind creature ? She never did anything but kindness to you or any mortal soul . As far as she knows she does her best . She does not set up to be more than she is . She gives you the best dinners she can buy , and the best company she can get . She pays the debts of that scamp of a husband of hers . She spoils her boy like the most virtuous mother in England . Her opinion about literary matters , to be sure , is not much ; and I daresay she never read a line of Wordsworth , or heard of Tennyson in her life . "
350673	350682	350685	350685	Pen	1865	" No more has Mrs. Flanagan the laundress , "
350689	350880	350685	350685	Pen	1865	" no more has Betty the housemaid ; and I have no word of blame against them . But a high - souled man does n't make friends of these . A gentleman does n't choose these for his companions , or bitterly rues it afterwards if he do . Are you , who are setting up to be a man of the world and a philosopher , to tell me that the aim of life is to guttle three courses and dine off silver ? Do you dare to own to yourself that your ambition in life is good claret , and that you 'll dine with any , provided you get a stalled ox to feed on ? You call me a Cynic - why , what a monstrous Cynicism it is , which you and the rest of you men of the world admit ! I 'd rather live upon raw turnips and sleep in a hollow tree , or turn backwoodsman or savage , than degrade myself to this civilisation , and own that a French cook was the thing in life best worth living for .

Who goes about professing particular admiration , or esteem , or friendship , or gratitude even , for the people one meets every day ? If A. asks me to his house , and gives me his best , I take his good things for what they are worth and no more . I do not profess to pay him back in friendship , but in the conventional money of society . When we part , we part without any grief . When we meet , we are tolerably glad to see one another . If I were only to live with my friends , your black muzzle , old George , is the only face I should see . "

We are not pledging ourselves for the correctness of his opinions , which readers will please to consider are delivered dramatically , the writer being no more answerable for them , than for the sentiments uttered by any other character of the story : our endeavour is merely to follow out , in its progress , the development of the mind of a worldly and selfish , but not ungenerous or unkind or truth - avoiding man . And it will be seen that the lamentable stage to which his logic at present has brought him , is one of general scepticism and sneering acquiescence in the world as it is ; or if you like so to call it , a belief qualified with scorn in all things extant . The tastes and habits of such a man prevent him from being a boisterous demagogue , and his love of truth and dislike of ca nt keep him from advancing crude propositions , such as many loud reformers are constantly ready with ; much more of uttering downright falsehoods in arguing questions or abusing opponents , which he would die or starve rather than use . It was not in our friend 's nature to be able to utter certain lies ; nor was he strong enough to protest against others , except with a polite sneer ; his maxim being , that he owed obedience to all Acts of Parliament , as long as they were not repealed . And to what does this easy and sceptical life lead a man ? Friend Arthur was a Sadducee , and the Baptist might be in the Wilderness shouting to the poor , who were listening with all their might and faith to the preacher 's awful accents and denunciations of wrath or woe or salvation ; and our friend the Sadducee would turn his sleek mule with a shrug and a smile from the crowd , and go home to the shade of his terrace , and muse over preacher and audience , and turn to his roll of Plato , or his pleasant Greek songbook babbling of honey and Hybla , and nymphs and fountains and love . To what , we say , does this scepticism lead ? It leads a man to a shameful loneliness and selfishness , so to speak - the more shameful , because it is so good - humoured and conscienceless and serene . Conscience ! What is conscience ? Why accept remorse ? What is public or private faith ? Mythuses alike enveloped in enormous tradition . If seeing and acknowledging the lies of the world , Arthur , as see them you can with only too fatal a clearness , you submit to them without any protest further than a laugh : if , plunged yourself in easy sensuality , you allow the whole wretched world to pass groaning by you unmoved : if the fight for the truth is taking place , and all men of honour are on the ground armed on the one side or the other , and you alone are to lie on your balcony and smoke your pipe out of the noise and the danger , you had better have died , or never have been at all , than such a sensual coward . "
354269	354275	354267	354267	friend	3188	" Arthur said , imperturbably ; "

355090	355653	355077	355077	I	0	" CHAPTER LXIII Which accounts perhaps for Chapter LXI The information regarding the affairs of the Clavering family , which Major Pendennis had acquired through Strong , and by his own personal interference as the friend of the house , was such as almost made the old gentleman pause in any plans which he might have once entertained for his nephew 's benefit . To bestow upon Arthur a wife with two such fathers - in - law , as the two worthies whom the guileless and unfortunate Lady Clavering had drawn in her marriage ventures , was to benefit no man . And though the one , in a manner , neutralised the other , and the appearance of Amory or Altamont in public would be the signal for his instantaneous withdrawal and condign punishment , - for the fugitive convict had cut down the officer in charge of him , - and a rope would be inevitably his end ; if he came again under British authorities ; yet , no guardian would like to secure for his ward a wife , whose parent was to be got rid of in such a way ; and the old gentleman 's notion always had been that Altamont , with the gallows before his eyes , would assuredly avoid recognition ; while , at the same time , by holding the threat of his discovery over Clavering , the latter , who would lose everything by Amory 's appearance , would be a slave in the hands of the person who knew so fatal a secret . But if the Begum paid Clavering 's debts many times more , her wealth would be expended altogether upon this irreclaimable reprobate ; and her heirs , whoever they might be , would succeed but to an emptied treasury ; and Miss Amory , instead of bringing her husband a good income and a seat in Parliament , would bring to that individual her person only , and her pedigree with that lamentable note of sus . per coll . at the name of the last male of her line . There was , however , to the old schemer revolving these things in his mind , another course yet open ; the which will appear to the reader who may take the trouble to peruse a conversation , which presently ensued , between Major Pendennis and the honourable Baronet , the Member for Clavering . When a man , under pecuniary difficulties , disappears from among his usual friends and equals , - dives out of sight , as it were , from the flock of birds in which he is accustomed to sail , it is wonderful at what strange and distant nooks he comes up again for breath . I have known a Pall Mall lounger and Rotten Row buck , of no inconsiderable fashion , vanish from amongst his comrades of the Clubs and the Park , and be discovered , very happy and affable , at an eighteenpenny ordinary in Billingsgate : another gentleman , of great learning and wit , when outrunning the constable were I to say he was a literary man , some critics would vow that I intended to insult the literary profession , once sent me his address at a little public - house called the "
355659	355763	355077	355077	I	0	" down a most darksome and cavernous archway in the Strand . Such a man , under such misfortunes , may have a house , but he is never in his house ; and has an address where letters may be left ; but only simpletons go with the hopes of seeing him . - Only a few of the faithful know where he is to be found , and have the clue to his hiding - place . So , after the disputes with his wife , and the misfortunes consequent thereon , to find Sir Francis Clavering at home was impossible . "
355810	356160	355806	355806	I	0	" Mr. Lightfoot remarked to his friend Morgan ; and announced that he should go down to my Lady , and be butler there , and marry his old woman . In like manner , after his altercations with Strong , the Baronet did not come near him , and fled to other haunts , out of the reach of the Chevalier 's reproaches ; - out of the reach of conscience , if possible , which many of us try to dodge and leave behind us by changes of scene and other fugitive stratagems . So , though the elder Pendennis , having his own ulterior object , was bent upon seeing Pen 's country neighbour and representative in Parliament , it took the Major no inconsiderable trouble and time before he could get him into such a confidential state and conversation , as were necessary for the ends which the Major had in view . For since the Major had been called in as family friend , and had cognisance of Clavering 's affairs , conjugal and pecuniary , the Baronet avoided him : as he always avoided all his lawyers and agents when there was an account to be rendered , or an affair of business to be discussed between them ; and never kept any appointment but when its object was the raising of money . Thus , previous to catching this most shy and timorous bird , the Major made more than one futile attempt to hold him ; - on one day it was a most innocent - looking invitation to dinner at Greenwich , to meet a few friends ; the Baronet accepted , suspected something , and did not come ; leaving the Major who indeed proposed to represent in himself the body of friends to eat his whitebait alone : - on another occasion the Major wrote and asked for ten minutes ' talk , and the Baronet instantly acknowledged the note , and made the appointment at four o'clock the next day at Bays 's precisely he carefully underlined the "
356162	356341	355806	355806	I	0	" ; but though four o'clock came , as in the course of time and destiny it could not do otherwise , no Clavering made his appearance . Indeed , if he had borrowed twenty pounds of Pendennis , he could not have been more timid , or desirous of avoiding the Major ; and the latter found that it was one thing to seek a man , and another to find him . Before the close of that day in which Strong 's patron had given the Chevalier the benefit of so many blessings before his face and curses behind his back , Sir Francis Clavering , who had pledged his word and his oath to his wife 's advisers to draw or accept no more bills of exchange , and to be content with the allowance which his victimised wife still awarded him , had managed to sign his respectable name to a piece of stamped paper , which the Baronet 's friend , Mr. Moss Abrams , had carried off , promising to have the bill "
356343	356407	356408	356408	He	11951	" by a party with whose intimacy Mr. Abrams was favoured . And it chanced that Strong heard of this transaction at the place where the writings had been drawn , - in the back - parlour , namely , of Mr. Santiago 's cigar - shop , where the Chevalier was constantly in the habit of spending an hour in the evening . "
356416	356423	356424	356424	He	11951	" Mr. Santiago told his customer . "
356508	356521	356504	356504	he	949	" A man who has the habit of putting his unlucky name to "
356525	356621	356504	356504	he	949	" at six months , has the satisfaction of knowing , too , that his affairs are known and canvassed , and his signature handed round among the very worst knaves and rogues of London . Mr. Santiago 's shop was close by St. James 's Street and Bury Street , where we have had the honour of visiting our friend Major Pendennis in his lodgings . The Major was walking daintily towards his apartment , as Strong , burning with wrath and redolent of Havanna , strode along the same pavement opposite to him . "
356635	356640	356628	356628	they	11957	" thought the Major . "
356680	356787	356677	356678	Mr. Strong	1260	" and the old gentleman , making a dignified bow to the Chevalier , was about to pass into his house ; directing towards the lock of the door , with trembling hand , the polished door - key . We have said that , at the long and weary disputes and conferences regarding the payment of Sir Francis Clavering 's last debts , Strong and Pendennis had both been present as friends and advisers of the Baronet 's unlucky family . Strong stopped and held out his hand to his brother negotiator , and old Pendennis put out towards him a couple of ungracious fingers . "
356794	356839	356790	356790	your	1260	" said Major Pendennis , patronising the other still further , and condescending to address to him an observation ; for old Pendennis had kept such good company all his life , that he vaguely imagined he honoured common men by speaking to them . "
356854	356855	356856	356856	My	0	" "
356864	356868	356862	356862	sir	2261	" Strong answered ; "
356899	356900	356888	356888	Clavering	693	" "
356914	356959	356905	356905	me	0	" cried the Major with awakened interest ; and the pair entered and took possession of his drawing - room . Here seated , Strong unburthened himself of his indignation to the Major , and spoke at large of Clavering 's recklessness and treachery . "
356968	356972	356966	356966	sir	2261	" he said . "
357096	357097	357098	357098	I	0	" "

357111	357117	357118	357118	He	11965	" Strong said , blushing . "
357246	357247	357238	357238	Altamont	1330	" "
357267	357276	357251	357265	that singular man , who I think came tipsy once to Sir Francis 's house	11987	" Major Pendennis said , with impenetrable countenance . "
357284	357285	357286	357286	I	0	" "
357300	357313	357289	357289	I	0	" the Chevalier answered , with a look of surprise and suspicion . "
357319	357324	357289	357289	I	0	" said the Major , "
357625	357626	357621	357621	he	1330	" "
357645	357695	357632	357632	I	0	" said Strong , rising and taking up his hat in dudgeon , for the Major 's patronising manner and impertinence of caution offended the honest gentleman not a little . Pendennis 's manner altered at once from a tone of hauteur to one of knowing good - humour . "
357929	357930	357927	357927	yours	1225	" "
357933	357940	357927	357927	yours	1225	" said Mr. Strong , drily . "
357996	358122	357987	357987	Morgan	820	" And Strong , preceded by Morgan , took his leave of Major Pendennis ; the Chevalier not a little puzzled at the old fellow 's prudence ; and the valet , to say the truth , to the full as much perplexed at his master 's reticence . For Mr. Morgan , in his capacity of accomplished valet , moved here and there in a house as silent as a shadow ; and , as it so happened , during the latter part of his master 's conversation with his visitor , had been standing very close to the door , and had overheard not a little of the talk between the two gentlemen , and a great deal more than he could understand . "
358135	358155	358156	358156	Strong	1260	" Mr. Morgan asked of Mr. Lightfoot , on the next convenient occasion when they met at the Club . "
358190	358195	358184	358184	Altamont	1330	" Mr. Lightfoot replied . "
358255	358256	358258	358258	you	12023	" "
358268	358272	358258	358258	you	12023	" Morgan asked . "
358293	358861	358282	358282	I	0	" Major Pendennis had often said with a laugh , that his vale Morgan was a much richer man than himself : and , indeed , by long course of careful speculation , this wary and silent attendant had been amassing a considerable sum of money , during the year which he had passed in the Major 's service , where he had made the acquaintance of many other valets of distinction , from whom he had learned the affairs of their principals . When Mr. Arthur came into his property , but not until then , Morgan had surprised the young gentleman , by saying that he had a little sum of money , some fifty or a hundred pound , which he wanted to lay out to advantage ; perhaps the gentlemen in the Temple , knowing about affairs and business and that , could help a poor fellow to a good investment ? Morgan would be very much obliged to Mr. Arthur , most grateful and obliged indeed , if Arthur could tell him of one . When Arthur laughingly replied , that he knew nothing about money matters , and knew no earthly way of helping Morgan , the latter , with the utmost simplicity , was very grateful , very grateful indeed , to Mr. Arthur , and if Mr. Arthur should want a little money before his rents was paid , perhaps he would kindly remember that his uncle 's old and faithful servant had some as he would like to put out : and be most proud if he could be useful anyways to any of the family . The Prince of Fairoaks , who was tolerably prudent and had no need of ready money , would as soon have thought of borrowing from his uncle 's servant as of stealing the valet 's pocket - handkerchief , and was on the point of making some haughty reply to Morgan 's offer , but was checked by the humour of the transaction . Morgan a capitalist ! Morgan offering to lend to him - The joke was excellent . On the other hand , the man might be quite innocent , and the proposal of money a simple offer of good - will . So Arthur withheld the sarcasm that was rising to his lips , and contented himself by declining Mr. Morgan 's kind proposal . He mentioned the matter to his uncle , however , and congratulated the latter on having such a treasure in his service . It was then that the Major said that he believed Morgan had been getting devilish rich for a devilish long time ; in fact , he had bought the house in Bury Street , in which his master was a lodger and had actually made a considerable sum of money , from his acquaintance with the Clavering family and his knowledge obtained through his master that the Begum would pay all her husband 's debts , by buying up as many of the Baronet 's acceptances as he could raise money to purchase . Of these transactions the Major , however , knew no more than most gentlemen do of their servants , who live with us all our days and are strangers to us , so strong custom is , and so pitiless the distinction between class and class . "
358873	358882	358871	358871	he	12027	" the elder Pendennis remarked to his nephew . "
358966	359022	358956	358956	he	12027	" On the day of Strong 's visit , the Major bethought him of Pen 's story , and that Morgan might help him , and rallied the valet regarding his wealth with that free and insolent way which so high - placed a gentleman might be disposed to adopt towards so unfortunate a creature . "
359036	359041	359026	359026	you	820	" said the Major . "
359053	359058	359044	359045	Mr. Arthur	739	" thought the valet . "
359070	359071	359059	359059	I	0	" "
359092	359098	359077	359077	I	0	" replied Morgan , demurely . "
359145	359189	359124	359124	I	0	" A public - house , thought Morgan - me in a public - house ! - the old fool ! - Dammy , if I was ten years younger I 'd set in Parlyment before I died , that I would . - "

359278	359285	359248	359248	I	0	" the elder said , graciously . "
359319	359320	359308	359309	my Lady	5047	" "
359332	359333	359323	359323	you	2261	" "
359341	359391	359336	359336	sir	2261	" replied Morgan , dropping down his eyes . And I do n't mind owning , sir , and I hope I may take the liberty of saying , sir , that a little more would make me very comfortable if it turned out as well as the last . "
359392	359408	359410	359411	the Major	2155	" Why , how much have you netted by him , in Gad 's name ? "
359413	359454	359410	359411	the Major	2155	" I 've done a good bit , sir , at it : that I own , sir . Having some information , and made acquaintance with the fam'ly through your kindness , I put on the pot , sir . "
359455	359460	359336	359336	sir	2261	" You did what ? "
359461	359566	359410	359411	the Major	2155	" I laid my money on , sir - I got all I could , and borrowed , and bought Sir Francis 's bills ; many of 'em had his name , and the gentleman 's as is just gone out , Edward Strong , Esquire , sir : and of course I know of the blow - hup and shindy as is took place in Grosvenor Place , sir : and as I may as well make my money as another , I 'd be very much obleeged to you if you 'd tell me whether my Lady will come down any more . "
359675	359680	359682	359682	he	12052	" Well , Morgan , "
359684	359790	359682	359682	he	12052	" I must n't ask how rich you are ; and the richer the better for your sake , I 'm sure . And if I could give you any information that could serve you , I would speedily help you . But frankly , if Lady Clavering asks me whether she shall pay any more of Sir Francis 's debts , I shall advise and I hope she wo n't , though I fear she will - and that is all I know . And so you are aware that Sir Francis is beginning again in his - eh - reckless and imprudent course ? "
359791	359810	359896	359896	Morgan	820	" At his old games , sir - ca n't prevent that gentleman . He will do it . "
359811	359849	359682	359682	he	12052	" Mr. Strong was saying that a Mr. Moss Abrams was the holder of one of Sir Francis Clavering 's notes . Do you know anything of this Mr. Abrams ; or the amount of the bill ? "
359850	359864	359682	359682	he	12052	" Do n't know the bill , know Abrams quite well , sir . "
359865	359894	359896	359896	Morgan	820	" I wish you would find out about it for me . And I wish you would find out where I can see Sir Francis Clavering , Morgan . "
359899	359914	359896	359896	Morgan	820	" Thank you , sir , yes , sir , I will , sir ; "
360096	360105	360107	360108	the Baronet	15718	" So it 's you , old boy ? "
360121	360142	360144	360145	the Major	2155	" How do you do , Sir Francis Clavering ? I wanted to see you , and followed you here , "
360187	360191	360192	360192	he	2155	" I know , "
360195	360218	360192	360192	he	2155	" who is the exceedingly disreputable person for whom you took me , Clavering ; and the errand which brought you here . "
360219	360229	360231	360232	the Baronet	15718	" It ai n't your business , is it ? "
360241	360342	360192	360192	he	2155	" Why are you following me about and taking the command , and meddling in my affairs , Major Pendennis ? I 've never done you any harm , have I ? I 've never had your money . And I do n't choose to be dodged about in this way , and domineered over . I do n't choose it , and I wo n't have it . If Lady Clavering has any proposal to make to me , let it be done in the regular way , and through the lawyers . I 'd rather not have you . "
360343	360352	360353	360354	the Major	2155	" I am not come from Lady Clavering , "
360357	360454	360353	360354	the Major	2155	" but of my own accord , to try and remonstrate with you , Clavering , and see if you can be kept from ruin . It is but a month ago that you swore on your honour , and wanted to get a Bible to strengthen the oath , that you would accept no more bills , but content yourself with the allowance which Lady Clavering gives you . All your debts were paid with that proviso , and you have broken it ; this Mr. Abrams has a bill of yours for sixty pounds . "
360455	360473	360476	360477	the Baronet	15718	" It 's an old bill . I take my solemn oath it 's an old bill , "
360479	360559	360476	360477	the Baronet	15718	" You drew it yesterday , and you dated it three months back purposely . By Gad , Clavering , you sicken me with lies , I ca n't help telling you so . I 've no patience with you , by Gad . You cheat everybody , yourself included . I 've seen a deal of the world , but I never met your equal at humbugging . It 's my belief you had rather lie than not . "
360560	360591	360593	360594	the Baronet	15718	" Have you come here , you old - old beast , to tempt me to - to pitch into you , and - and knock your old head off ? "
360606	360611	360614	360616	the old Major	20432	" What , sir ? "
360642	360647	360649	360649	Clavering	693	" No , no , "
360653	360721	360649	360649	Clavering	693	" I beg your pardon . I did n't mean to be angry , or say anything unkind , only you 're so damned harsh to me , Major Pendennis . What is it you want of me ? Why have you been hunting me so ? Do you want money out of me too ? By Jove , you know I 've not got a shilling , "
360762	360776	360777	360777	Pendennis	693	" I 've no errand from anybody , or no design upon you , "
360780	360816	360777	360777	Pendennis	693	" but an endeavour , if it 's not too late , to save you and your family from utter ruin , through the infernal recklessness of your courses . I knew your secret - - "
360817	360869	360870	360871	the Baronet	15718	" I did n't know it when I married her ; upon my oath I did n't know it till the d - - d scoundrel came back and told me himself ; and it 's the misery about that which makes me so reckless , Pendennis ; indeed it is , "
360878	360995	360870	360871	the Baronet	15718	" I knew your secret from the very first day when I saw Amory come drunk into your dining - room in Grosvenor Place . I never forget faces . I remember that fellow in Sydney a convict , and he remembers me . I know his trial , the date of his marriage , and of his reported death in the bush . I could swear to him . And I know that you are no more married to Lady Clavering than I am . I 've kept your secret well enough , for I 've not told a single soul that I know it , - not your wife , not yourself till now . "
360996	361008	360777	360777	Pendennis	693	" Poor Lady C. , it would cut her up dreadfully , "
361013	361029	360777	360777	Pendennis	693	" and it was n't my fault , Major ; you know it was n't . "
361030	361291	360870	360871	the Baronet	15718	" Rather than allow you to go on ruining her as you do ; I will tell her , Clavering , and tell all the world too ; that is what I swear I will do , unless I can come to some terms with you , and put some curb on your infernal folly . By play , debt , and extravagance of all kind , you 've got through half your wife 's fortune , and that of her legitimate heirs , mind - her legitimate heirs . Here it must stop . You ca n't live together . You 're not fit to live in a great house like Clavering ; and before three years ' more were over would not leave a shilling to carry on . I 've settled what must be done . You shall have six hundred a year ; you shall go abroad and live on that . You must give up Parliament , and get on as well as you can . If you refuse , I give you my word I 'll make the real state of things known to - morrow ; I 'll swear to Amory , who , when identified , will go back to the country from whence he came , and will rid the widow of you and himself together . And so that boy of yours loses at once all title to old Spell 's property , and it goes to your wife 's daughter . Ai n't I making myself pretty clearly understood ? "
361292	361309	361311	361312	the father	15077	" You would n't be so cruel to that poor boy , would you , Pendennis ? "
361317	361344	361311	361312	the father	15077	" hang it , think about him . He 's a nice boy : though he 's dev'lish wild , I own he 's dev'lish wild . "
361345	361355	361357	361359	the old moralist	12085	" It 's you who are cruel to him , "
361361	361376	361357	361359	the old moralist	12085	" Why , sir , you 'll ruin him yourself inevitably in three years . "
361377	361437	360870	360871	the Baronet	15718	" Yes , but perhaps I wo n't have such dev'lish bad luck , you know ; - the luck must turn : and I 'll reform , by Gad , I 'll reform . And if you were to split on me , it would cut up my wife so ; you know it would , most infernally . "
361438	361445	361447	361449	the old Major	20432	" To be parted from you , "
361455	361466	361447	361449	the old Major	20432	" you know she wo n't live with you again . "
361467	361496	361497	361497	Clavering	693	" But why ca n't Lady C. live abroad , or at Bath , or at Tunbridge , or at the doose , and I go on here ? "
361500	361660	361497	361497	Clavering	693	" I like being here better than abroad , and I like being in Parliament . It 's dev'lish convenient being in Parliament . There 's very few seats like mine left ; and if I gave it to 'em , I should not wonder the ministry would give me an island to govern , or some dev'lish good thing ; for you know I 'm a gentleman of dev'lish good family , and have a handle to my name , and - and that sort of thing , Major Pendennis . Eh , do n't you see ? Do n't you think they 'd give me something dev'lish good if I was to play my cards well ? And then , you know , I 'd save money , and be kept out of the way of the confounded hells and rouge et noir - and - and so I 'd rather not give up Parliament , please . "
361705	361713	361714	361715	the Major	2155	" As for your seat in Parliament , "
361739	361755	361724	361724	his	2155	" you must part with that , Sir Francis Clavering , to - to me . "
361756	361769	361724	361724	his	2155	" What ! are you going into the House , Major Pendennis ? "
361770	361820	361821	361822	the Major	2155	" No - not I ; but my nephew , Arthur , is a very clever fellow and would make a figure there : and when Clavering had two members , his father might very likely have been one ; and - and should like Arthur to be there , "
361825	361835	361821	361822	the Major	2155	" Dammy , does he know it , too ? "
361840	361849	361838	361838	Clavering	693	" Nobody knows anything out of this room , "
361867	361887	361862	361862	I	0	" If not , I 'm a man of my word , and will do what I have said . "
361888	361894	361896	361897	Sir Francis	693	" I say , Major , "
361904	361985	361862	361862	I	0	" You - You could n't get me my first quarter in advance , could you , like the best of fellows ? You can do anything with Lady Clavering ; and , upon my oath , I 'll take up that bill of Abrams ' . The little dam scoundrel , I know he 'll do me in the business - he always does ; and if you could do this for me , we 'd see , Major . "
361986	362035	361862	361862	I	0	" And I think your best plan would be to go down in September to Clavering to shoot , and take my nephew with you , and introduce him . Yes , that will be the best time . And we will try and manage about the advance . "
362061	362115	361862	361862	I	0	" And , Clavering , you understand , of course , my nephew knows nothing about this business . You have a mind to retire : he is a Clavering man and a good representative . for the borough ; you introduce him , and your people vote for him - you see . "
362116	362181	362182	362184	The old Major	20432	" When can you get me the hundred and fifty , Major ? When shall I come and see you ? Will you be at home this evening or to - morrow morning ? Will you have anything here ? They 've got some dev'lish good bitters in the bar . I often have a glass of bitters , it sets one up so . "
362307	363591	363592	363592	he	12102	" a dinner at Greenwich to his distinguished friend , and passed the evening gaily at Vauxhall . Meanwhile Major Pendennis , calling a cab in Piccadilly , drove to Lamb Court , Temple , where he speedily was closeted with his nephew in deep conversation . After their talk they parted on very good terms , and it was in consequence of that unreported conversation , whereof the reader nevertheless can pretty well guess the bearing , that Arthur expressed himself as we have heard in the colloquy with Warrington , which is reported in the last chapter . When a man is tempted to do a tempting thing , he can find a hundred ingenious reasons for gratifying his liking ; and Arthur thought very much that he would like to be in Parliament , and that he would like to distinguish himself there , and that he need not care much what side he took , as there was falsehood and truth on every side . And on this and on other matters he thought he would compromise with his conscience , and that Sadduceeism was a very convenient and good - humoured profession of faith . CHAPTER LXIV Phyllis and Corydon On a picturesque common in the neighbourhood of Tunbridge Wells , Lady Clavering had found a pretty villa , whither she retired after her conjugal disputes at the end of that unlucky London season . Miss Amory , of course , accompanied her mother , and Master Clavering came home for the holidays , with whom Blanche 's chief occupation was to fight and quarrel . But this was only a home pastime , and the young schoolboy was not fond of home sports . He found cricket , and horses , and plenty of friends at Tunbridge . The good - natured Begum 's house was filled with a constant society of young gentlemen of thirteen , who ate and drank much too copiously of tarts and champagne , who rode races on the lawn , and frightened the fond mother , who smoked and made themselves sick , and the dining - room unbearable to Miss Blanche . She did not like the society of young gentlemen of thirteen . As for that fair young creature , any change as long as it was change was pleasant to her ; and for a week or two she would have liked poverty and a cottage , and bread - and - cheese ; and , for a night , perhaps , a dungeon and bread - and - water , and so the move to Tunbridge was by no means unwelcome to her . She wandered in the woods , and sketched trees and farmhouses ; she read French novels habitually ; she drove into Tunbridge Wells pretty often , and to any play , or ball , or conjurer , or musician who might happen to appear in the place ; she slept a great deal ; she quarrelled with Mamma and Frank during the morning ; she found the little village school and attended it , and first fondled the girls and thwarted the mistress , then scolded the girls and laughed at the teacher ; she was constant at church , of course . It was a pretty little church , of immense antiquity - a little Anglo - Norman bijou , built the day before yesterday , and decorated with all sorts of painted windows , carved saints ' heads , gilt scripture texts , and open pews . Blanche began forthwith to work a most correct high - church altar - cover for the church . She passed for a saint with the clergyman for a while , whom she quite took in , and whom she coaxed , and wheedled , and fondled so artfully , that poor Mrs. Smirke , who at first was charmed with her , then bore with her , then would hardly speak to her , was almost mad with jealousy . Mrs. Smirke was the wife of our old friend Smirke , Pen 's tutor and poor Helen 's suitor . He had consoled himself for her refusal with a young lady from Clapham whom his mamma provided . When the latter died , our friend 's views became every day more and more pronounced . He cut off his coat collar , and let his hair grow over his back . He rigorously gave up the curl which he used to sport on his forehead , and the tie of his neckcloth , of which he was rather proud . He went without any tie at all . He went without dinner on Fridays . He read the Roman Hours , and intimated that he was ready to receive confessions in the vestry . The most harmless creature in the world , he was denounced as a black and most dangerous Jesuit and Papist , by Muffin of the Dissenting chapel , and Mr. Simeon Knight at the old church . Mr. Smirke had built his chapel - of - ease with the money left him by his mother at Clapham . Lord ! lord ! what would she have said to hear a table called an altar ! to see candlesticks on it ! to get letters signed on the Feast of Saint So - and - so , or the Vigil of Saint What - do - you - call-'em ! All these things did the boy of Clapham practise ; his faithful wife following him . But when Blanche had a conference of near two hours in the vestry with Mr. Smirke , Belinda paced up and down on the grass , where there were only two little grave - stones as yet ; she wished that she had a third there : only , only he would offer very likely to that creature , who had infatuated him in a fortnight . No , she would retire ; she would go into a convent , and profess and leave him . Such bad thoughts had Smirke 's wife and his neighbours regarding him ; these , thinking him in direct correspondence with the Bishop of Rome ; that , bewailing errors to her even more odious and fatal ; and yet our friend meant no earthly harm . The post - office never brought him any letters from the Pope ; he thought Blanche , to be sure , at first , the most pious , gifted , right - thinking , fascinating person he had ever met ; and her manner of singing the Chants delighted him - but after a while he began to grow rather tired of Miss Amory , her ways and graces grew stale somehow ; then he was doubtful about Miss Amory ; then she made a disturbance in his school , lost her temper , and rapped the children 's fingers . Blanche inspired this admiration and satiety , somehow , in many men . She tried to please them , and flung out all her graces at once ; came down to them with all her jewels on , all her smiles , and cajoleries , and coaxings , and ogles . Then she grew tired of them and of trying to please them , and never having cared about them , dropped them : and the men grew tired of her , and dropped her too . It was a happy night for Belinda when Blanche went away ; and her husband , with rather a blush and a sigh , said "
363656	363684	363637	363637	she	12103	" Belinda flew to his arms , there was no question about the grave or the veil any more . He tenderly embraced her on the forehead . "
363694	363707	363637	363637	she	12103	" he said , throwing his fine eyes up to the ceiling , "
363712	364014	364015	364015	Arthur	739	" As for Blanche , from the instant she lost sight of him and Belinda , she never thought or cared about either any more . But when Arthur went down to pass a few days at Tunbridge Wells with the Begum , this stage of indifference had not arrived on Miss Blanche 's part or on that of the simple clergyman . Smirke believed her to be an angel and wonder of a woman . Such a perfection he had never seen , and sate listening to her music in the summer evenings , open - mouthed , rapt in wonder , tea - less , and bread - and - butter - less . Fascinating as he had heard the music of the opera to be - he had never but once attended an exhibition of that nature which he mentioned with a blush and a sigh - it was on that day when he had accompanied Helen and her son to the play at Chatteris - he could not conceive anything more delicious , more celestial , he had almost said , than Miss Amory 's music . She was a most gifted being : she had a precious soul : she had the most remarkable talents - to all outward seeming , the most heavenly disposition , etc . etc . It was in this way that , being then at the height of his own fever and bewitchment for Blanche , Smirke discoursed to Arthur about her . The meeting between the two old acquaintances had been very cordial . Arthur loved anybody who loved his mother ; Smirke could speak on that theme with genuine feeling and emotion . They had a hundred things to tell each other of what had occurred in their lives . "
364019	364023	364015	364015	Arthur	739	" Smirke said , "
364039	364308	364034	364034	themselves	12108	" Mrs. Smirke , a most exemplary person , seconded them with all her endeavours . He had built this little church on his mother 's demise , who had left him provided with a sufficiency of worldly means . Though in the cloister himself , he had heard of Arthur 's reputation . He spoke in the kindest and most saddened tone ; he held his eyelids down , and bowed his fair head on one side . Arthur was immensely amused with him ; with his airs ; with his follies and simplicity ; with his blank stock and long hair ; with his real goodness , kindness , friendliness of feeling . And his praises of Blanche pleased and surprised our friend not a little , and made him regard her with eyes of particular favour . The truth is , Blanche was very glad to see Arthur ; as one is glad to see an agreeable man in the country , who brings down the last news and stories from the great city ; who can talk better than most country - folks , at least can talk that darling London jargon , so dear and indispensable to London people , so little understood by persons out of the world . The first day Pen came down , he kept Blanche laughing for hours after dinner . She sang her songs with redoubled spirit . She did not scold her mother ; she fondled and kissed her , to the honest Begum 's surprise . When it came to be bedtime , she said , "
364311	364367	364034	364034	themselves	12108	" with the prettiest air of regret possible ; and was really quite sorry to go to bed , and squeezed Arthur 's hand quite fondly . He on his side gave her pretty palm a very cordial pressure . Our young gentleman was of that turn , that eyes very moderately bright dazzled him . "
364374	364384	364034	364034	themselves	12108	" thought Pen , looking out into the night , "
364474	364491	364465	364465	I	0	" And he hummed a tune which Blanche had put to some verses of his own . "
364541	364542	364528	364528	she	1236	" "
364547	364585	364528	364528	she	1236	" Here broke out a voice from a clematis - covered casement near - a girl 's voice : it was the voice of the author of ' Mes Larmes . ' Pen burst into a laugh . "
364593	364604	364528	364528	she	1236	" he said , leaning out of his own window . "
364614	364624	364610	364610	I	0	" cried the lady of ' Mes Larmes . ' "
364661	364861	364863	364863	she	12121	" And Pen began to sing the Goodnight to Don Basilio . The next day they were walking in the fields together , laughing and chattering - the gayest pair of friends . They talked about the days of their youth , and Blanche was prettily sentimental . They talked about Laura , dearest Laura - Blanche had loved her as a sister : was she happy with that odd Lady Rockminster ? Would n't she come and stay with them at Tunbridge ? Oh , what walks they would take together ! What songs they would sing - the old , old songs ! Laura 's voice was splendid . Did Arthur - she must call him Arthur - remember the songs they sang in the happy old days , now he was grown such a great man , and had such a succes ? etc . etc . And the day after , which was enlivened with a happy ramble through the woods to Penshurst , and a sight of that pleasant park and hall , came that conversation with the curate which we have narrated , and which made our young friend think more and more . "
364868	364873	364863	364863	she	12121	" he asked himself . "
364913	364977	364911	364911	her	12121	" And walking with his old tutor over his little parish , and going to visit his school , it was with inexpressible delight that Pen found Blanche seated instructing the children , and fancied to himself how patient she must be , how good - natured , how ingenuous , how really simple in her tastes , and unspoiled by the world . "
364986	364996	364997	364997	I	0	" he asked her , as they walked together . "
365087	365088	365085	365085	heigho	12134	" "
365095	365096	365093	365093	Blanche	1236	" "
365101	365102	365093	365093	Blanche	1236	" "

365127	365140	365141	365141	You	1236	" and a second edition of ' Mes Soupirs ' came out . "
365149	365150	365141	365141	You	1236	" "
365185	365586	365177	365177	I	0	" ' Mes Soupirs ' were here laid aside , and ' Mes Larmes ' had begun . Ah ! What answer is given to those in the eyes of a young woman ? What is the method employed for drying them ? What took place ? O ringdoves and roses , O dews and wildflowers , O waving greenwoods and balmy airs of summer ! Here were two battered London rakes , taking themselves in for a moment , and fancying that they were in love with each other , like Phillis and Corydon ! When one thinks of country houses and country walks , one wonders that any man is left unmarried . CHAPTER LXV Temptation Easy and frank - spoken as Pendennis commonly was with Warrington , how came it that Arthur did not inform the friend and depository of all his secrets , of the little circumstances which had taken place at the villa near Tunbridge Wells ? He talked about the discovery of his old tutor Smirke , freely enough , and of his wife , and of his Anglo - Norman church , and of his departure from Clapha to Rome ; but , when asked about Blanche , his answers were evasive or general : he said she was a good - natured clever little thing , that rightly guided she make no such bad wife after all , but that he had for the moment no intention of marriage , that his days of romance were over , that he was contented with his present lot , and so forth . In the meantime there came occasionally to Lamb Court , Temple , pretty little satin envelopes , superscribed in the neatest handwriting , and sealed with one of those admirable ciphers , which , if Warrington had been curious enough to watch his friend 's letters , or indeed if the cipher had been decipherable , would have shown George that Mr. Arthur was in correspondence with a young lady whose initials were B. A. To these pretty little compositions Mr. Pen replied in his best and gallantest manner ; with jokes , with news of the town , with points of wit , nay , with pretty little verses very likely , in reply to the versicles of the Muse of ' Mes Larmes . ' Blanche we know rhymes with "
365589	365594	365177	365177	I	0	" and ' stanch , "
365596	365599	365177	365177	I	0	" launch , "
365713	365720	365721	365723	the elder Pendennis	739	" Verses are all very well , "
365747	365837	365728	365728	Pen	1865	" and letter - writing if mamma allows it , and between such old country friends of course there may be a correspondence , and that sort of thing - but mind , Pen , and do n't commit yourself , my boy . For who knows what the doose may happen ? The best way is to make your letters safe . I never wrote a letter in all my life that would commit me , and demmy , sir , I have had some experience of women . "

366102	366134	366135	366135	Arthur	739	" Do n't you remember the lesson I had , sir , in Lady Mirabel 's - Miss Fotheringay 's affair ? I am not to be caught again , uncle , "

367566	367580	367582	367582	Strong	1260	" Yes , if it had n't been for this good fellow here , "
367585	367713	367582	367582	Strong	1260	" for a good fellow you are , Altamont , my boy , and hang me if I do n't stand by you as long as I live , - I think , Pendennis , it would have been all up with Ned Strong . I was the fifth week of my being kept a prisoner , for I could n't be always risking my neck across that water - pipe , and taking my walks abroad through poor old Cos 's window , and my spirit was quite broken , sir - dammy , quite beat , and I was thinking of putting an end to myself , and should have done it in another week , when who should drop down from heaven but Altamont ! "
367714	367724	367726	367726	Altamont	1314	" Heaven ai n't exactly the place , Ned , "
367728	367736	367738	367738	he	1314	" I came from Baden - Baden , "
367740	367755	367738	367738	he	1314	" and I 'd had a deuced lucky month there , that 's all . "
367756	367789	367791	367791	Strong	1225	" Well , sir , he took up Marks 's bill , and he paid the other fellows that were upon me , like a man , sir , that he did , "
367795	367821	367823	367824	Mr. Altamont	1330	" And I shall be very happy to stand a bottle of claret for this company , and as many more as the company chooses , "
367830	367894	367823	367824	Mr. Altamont	1330	" Hallo ! waiter , bring us a magnum of the right sort , do you hear ? And we 'll drink our healths all round , sir - and may every good fellow like Strong find another good fellow to stand by him at a pinch . That 's my sentiment , Mr. Pendennis , though I do n't like your name . "
367895	367901	367903	367903	Arthur	739	" No ! And why ? "
367939	367956	367917	367917	Altamont	1314	" He was a gentleman , and that was sufficient , and they were all gentlemen . "
367961	367964	367970	367971	whither Pendennis	739	" all gentlemen "
368095	368104	368105	368105	Altamont	1314	" As for me , it 's nothing , "
368108	368277	368105	368105	Altamont	1314	" When a ship 's paid off , a chap spends his money , you know . And it 's the fellers at the black and red at Baden - Baden that did it . I won a good bit of money there , and intend to win a good bit more , do n't I , Strong ? I 'm going to take him with me . I 've got a system . I 'll make his fortune , I tell you . I 'll make your fortune , if you like - dammy , everybody 's fortune . But what I 'll do , and no mistake , boys , I promise you . I 'll put in for that little Fanny . Dammy , sir , what do you think she did ? She had two pound , and I 'm blest if she did n't go and lend it to Ned Strong ! Did n't she , Ned ? Let 's drink her health . "
368278	368284	368286	368286	Arthur	739	" With all my heart , "
368466	368508	368459	368464	the Italian that ' stood in	12265	" As he emptied his bottle , the Colonel described at full length all his plans and prospects to Pen , who was interested in listening to his story , and the confessions of his daring and lawless good - humour . "
368519	368532	368533	368533	Altamont	1330	" Pen said to his uncle , a day or two afterwards . "
368545	368550	368540	368541	Lord Westport	2017	" said the Major . "
368573	368580	368581	368581	he	12268	" said the nephew , laughing , "
368607	368608	368593	368593	he	12268	" "
368627	368633	368621	368621	I	0	" said the impenetrable Major ; "
368655	368660	368653	368653	Arthur	739	" Arthur laughed again . "
368718	368719	368720	368720	I	0	" "
368815	368816	368821	368821	you	12274	" "
368843	368844	368845	368845	Clavering	693	" "
368854	368859	368862	368862	he	12275	" the Major answered . "
368937	368991	368992	368992	everybody	2177	" The Major had an answer of this kind to most of Pen 's objections , and Pen accepted his uncle 's replies , not so much because he believed them , but because he wished to believe them . We do a thing - which of us has not ? - not because "
368996	369481	368992	368992	everybody	2177	" but because we like it ; and our acquiescence , alas ! proves not that everybody is right , but that we and the rest of the world are poor creatures alike . At his next visit to Tunbridge , Mr. Pen did not forget to amuse Miss Blanche with the history which he had learned at Richmond of the Chevalier 's imprisonment , and of Altamont 's gallant rescue . And after he had told his tale in his usual satirical way , he mentioned with praise and emotion little Fanny 's generous behaviour to the Chevalier , and Altamont 's enthusiasm in her behalf . Miss Blanche was somewhat jealous , and a good deal piqued and curious about Fanny . Among the many confidential little communications which Arthur made to Miss Amory in the course of their delightful rural drives and their sweet evening walks , it may be supposed that our hero would not forget a story so interesting to himself and so likely to be interesting to her , as that of the passion and cure of the poor little Ariadne of Shepherd 's Inn . His own part in that drama he described , to do him justice , with becoming modesty ; the moral which he wished to draw from the tale being one in accordance with his usual satirical mood , viz . , that women get over their first loves quite as easily as men do for the fair Blanche , in their intimes conversations , did not cease to twit Mr. Pen about his notorious failure in his own virgin attachment to the Fotheringay , and , number one being withdrawn , transfer themselves to number two without much difficulty . And poor little Fanny was offered up in sacrifice as an instance to prove this theory . What griefs she had endured and surmounted , what bitter pangs of hopeless attachment she had gone through , what time it had taken to heal those wounds of the tender little bleeding heart , Mr. Pen did not know , or perhaps did not choose to know ; for he was at once modest and doubtful about his capabilities as a conqueror of hearts , and averse to believe that he had executed any dangerous ravages on that particular one , though his own instance and argument told against himself in this case ; for if , as he said , Miss Fanny was by this time in love with her surgical adorer , who had neither good looks , nor good manners , nor wit , nor anything but ardour and fidelity to recommend him , must she not in her first sickness of the love - complaint have had a serious attack , and suffered keenly for a man who had certainly a number of the showy qualities which Mr. Huxter wanted ? "
369487	369492	369482	369482	You	12294	" Miss Blanche said , "
369520	369684	369512	369512	you	12294	" Perhaps Miss Amory was right , as the blush which came in spite of himself and tingled upon Pendennis 's cheek one of those blows with which a man 's vanity is constantly slapping his face proved to Pen that he was angry to think he had been superseded by such a rival . By such a fellow as that ! without any conceivable good quality ! O Mr. Pendennis ! although this remark does not apply to such a smart fellow as you if Nature had not made that provision for each sex in the credulity of the other , which sees good qualities where none exist , good looks in donkeys ' ears , wit in their numskulls , and music in their bray , there would not have been near so much marrying and giving in marriage as now obtains , and as is necessary for the due propagation and continuance of the noble race to which we belong . "
369689	369693	369696	369696	Blanche	1236	" Pen said , "
369896	369897	369901	369901	you	12304	" "
369931	369947	369957	369957	You	12304	" - asked the author of ' Mes Larmes , ' with a charming moue - "
370039	370040	370028	370028	Fanny	986	" "
370049	370078	370043	370043	I	0	" said Pen , looking very gloomily at Blanche , and not offering by any means to repeat the attempt at consolation , which had elicited that sweet monosyllable "
370081	370087	370088	370088	I	0	" from the young lady . "
370164	370165	370143	370143	I	0	" "
370172	370181	370170	370170	Monsieur	12312	" said the Sylphide , making a curtsey . "
370188	370206	370186	370186	Blanche	1236	" said Pen , taking her hand , and with his voice of sad good - humour ; "
370215	370216	370209	370209	I	0	" "
370221	370355	370209	370209	I	0	" said Miss Blanche . And tell you no foolish lies , as vulgar men do . Why should you and I , with our experience , ape romance and dissemble passion ? I do not believe Miss Blanche Amory to be peerless among the beautiful , nor the greatest poetess , nor the most surpassing musician , any more than I believe you to be the tallest woman in the whole world - like the giantess whose picture we saw as we rode through the fair yesterday . But if I do n't set you up as a heroine , neither do I offer you your very humble servant as a hero . But I think you are - well , there , I think you are very sufficiently good - looking . "
370356	370359	370360	370361	Miss Blanche	1236	" Merci , "
370368	370400	370360	370361	Miss Blanche	1236	" I think you sing charmingly . I 'm sure you 're clever . I hope and believe that you are good - natured , and that you will be companionable . "
370401	370432	370434	370434	Blanche	1236	" And so , provided I bring you a certain sum of money and a seat in Parliament , you condescend to fling to me your royal pocket - handkerchief , "
370436	370506	370434	370434	Blanche	1236	" Que d'honneur ! We used to call your Highness the Prince of Fairoaks . What an honour to think that I am to be elevated to the throne , and to bring the seat in Parliament as backsheesh to the sultan ! I am glad I am clever , and that I can play and sing to your liking ; my songs will amuse my lord 's leisure . "
370507	370516	370518	370518	Pen	1865	" And if thieves are about the house , "
370525	370569	370518	370518	Pen	1865	" forty besetting thieves in the shape of lurking cares and enemies in ambush and passions in arms , my Morgiana will dance round me with a tambourine , and kill all my rogues and thieves with a smile . Wo n't she ? "
370583	370588	370589	370589	he	1865	" Ah , Blanche , "
370595	370815	370589	370589	he	1865	" do n't be angry ; do n't be hurt at my truth - telling . - Do n't you see that I always take you at your word ? You say you will be a slave and dance - I say , dance . You say , ' I take you with what you bring : ' I say , ' I take you with what you bring . ' To the necessary deceits and hypocrisies of our life , why add any that are useless and unnecessary ? If I offer myself to you because I think we have a fair chance of being happy together , and because by your help I may get for both of us a good place and a not undistinguished name , why ask me to feign raptures and counterfeit romance , in which neither of us believe ? Do you want me to come wooing in a Prince Prettyman 's dress from the masquerade warehouse , and to pay you compliments like Sir Charles Grandison ? Do you want me to make you verses as in the days when we were - when we were children ? I will if you like , and sell them to Bacon and Bungay afterwards . Shall I feed my pretty princess with bonbons ? "
370816	370824	370826	370828	the little Sylphide	12314	" Mais j'adore les bonbons , moi , "
370836	370869	370870	370870	Pen	1865	" I can buy a hatful at Fortnum and Mason 's for a guinea . And it shall have its bonbons , its pooty little sugar - plums , that it shall , "
370877	370905	370907	370907	he	1865	" Nay , my dear , nay , my dearest little Blanche , do n't cry . Dry the pretty eyes , I ca n't bear that ; "
370960	370991	370993	370993	she	15211	" I - I do n't want your consolation . I - I never was - so - spoken to before - by any of my - my - by anybody "
371001	371004	371007	371007	Pen	1865	" Anybody ! "
371037	371047	371033	371033	she	1236	" O Arthur , vous etes un homme terrible ! "
371084	371090	371091	371091	she	1236	" Tell me , Arthur , "
371104	371117	371091	371091	she	1236	" Why does Sir Francis Clavering give up his seat in Parliament ? "
371118	371130	371132	371132	Arthur	739	" Au fait , why does he give it to me ? "
371140	371148	371149	371149	she	1236	" You always mock me , sir , "
371152	371169	371149	371149	she	1236	" If it is good to be in Parliament , why does Sir Francis go out ? "
371170	371239	371240	371240	Pen	1865	" My uncle has talked him over . He always said that you were not sufficiently provided for . In the - the family disputes , when your mamma paid his debts so liberally , it was stipulated , I suppose , that you - that is , that I - that is , upon my word , I do n't know why he goes out of Parliament , "
371249	371295	371240	371240	Pen	1865	" You see , Blanche , that you and I are two good little children , and that this marriage has been arranged for us by our mammas and uncles , and that we must be obedient , like a good little boy and girl . "
372645	372647	372635	372635	he	799	" presiding "
373113	373120	373121	373122	the Captain	14344	" I understand you , sir , "
373403	373434	373395	373396	Mr. Hobnell	1069	" I suppose , Hodson , your hands are slippery with bear's - grease . He 's always dropping the crockery about , that Hodson is - haw , haw ! "
373495	373512	373487	373487	Pen	799	" I think , Mr. Stooks , you should have asked Hodson to cut the hare , "
373978	373998	373959	373959	Blanche	1236	" Pray , sir , will you have the kindness to show us the way to Shepherd 's Inn ? "
374043	374060	374061	374061	Bonner	1275	" Shepherd 's Inn ! what can you want in Shepherd 's Inn , Miss Blanche ? "
374064	374080	374061	374061	Bonner	1275	" Mr. Strong lives there . Do you want to go and see the Captain ? "
374081	374167	374169	374169	she	12476	" I should like to see the Captain very well . I like the Captain ; but it is not him I want . I want to see a dear little good girl , who was very kind to - to Mr. Arthur when he was so ill last year , and saved his life almost ; and I want to thank her and ask her if she would like anything . I looked out several of my dresses on purpose this morning , Bonner ! "
374239	374247	374249	374250	Mrs. Bonner	1275	" Pretty girl - pretty young woman ! "
374252	374266	374270	374270	she	1236	" I know I want no pretty young women to come about Lightfoot , "
374491	374509	374510	374511	Mrs. Bolton	842	" My good woman ! I want to see Fanny - Fanny Bolton ; is she here ? "
374538	374548	374549	374549	she	842	" What do you want with Fanny , pray ? "
374552	374579	374549	374549	she	842	" I am Lady Clavering 's daughter - you have heard of Sir Francis Clavering ? And I wish very much indeed to see Fanny Bolton . "
374580	374596	374597	374599	Betsy - Jane	1065	" Pray step in , miss . - Betsy - Jane , where 's Fanny ? "
374635	374653	374656	374657	Miss Blanche	1236	" In Captain Strong 's rooms ! oh , let us go to Captain Strong 's rooms , "
374659	374679	374682	374683	Miss Blanche	1236	" I know him very well . You dearest little girl , show us the way to Captain Strong ! "

374752	374779	374750	374750	himself	12499	" That 's a devilish foine gyurll , bedad , goan up to Sthrong and Altamont : they 're always having foine gyurlls up their stairs . "
374780	374787	374788	374788	he	12499	" Hallo - hwhat 's that ? "
374884	374899	374901	374901	Costigan	847	" It 's oi , me boy . Hwhat 's that noise , Sthrong ? "
374903	374911	374901	374901	Costigan	847	" Go to the d - - ! "
375154	375160	375150	375151	the domestic	12519	" Walk in , ladies , "
375369	375375	375377	375377	Grady	1672	" The women 's come , "
375386	375400	375402	375402	Altamont	1330	" Did you ask 'em if they would take a glass of anything ? "
375408	375419	375420	375421	the domestic	12519	" He says , will you take anything to drink ? "
375450	375458	375447	375448	Mrs. Bonner	1275	" Shall we take anything to drink ? "
375459	375470	375472	375473	Mr. Grady	1672	" Well , you may take it or lave it , "
375499	375507	375508	375508	Blanche	1236	" Will we take anything to drink ? "
375518	375521	375508	375508	Blanche	1236	" Grady , "
375569	375575	375545	375545	his	1672	" Grady , my coat ! "
375583	375594	375596	375597	the Sylphide	1587	" Why , that is not Mr. Strong 's voice , "
375603	375623	375596	375597	the Sylphide	1587	" Grady my coat ! - Bonner , who is Grady my coat ? We ought to go away . "
375652	375658	375646	375656	the individual who had called out " Grady , my coat	24853	" Grady , my coat , "
375678	375716	375717	375717	He	1672	" I beg your pardon , ladies . Grady , bring my coat down , sir ! Well , my dears , it 's a fine day , and we 'll have a jolly lark at - - "
375741	375746	375724	375725	Mrs. Bonner	1275	" Amory ! Amory ! "
375783	375788	375789	375789	he	14896	" Yes , Betsy , "
375792	375872	375789	375789	he	14896	" by G - it is me . Mary Bonner knew me . What a fine gal we 've grown ! But it 's a secret , mind . I 'm dead , though I 'm your father . Your poor mother do n't know it . What a pretty gal we 've grown ! Kiss me - kiss me close , my Betsy ? D - - it , I love you : I 'm your old father . "
376026	376036	376037	376037	he	1672	" Grady , go and wait in the court , "
376040	376050	376037	376037	he	1672	" and if anybody comes - you understand me . "
376051	376062	376064	376064	Grady	1672	" Is it the play - actress and her mother ? "
376066	376090	376064	376064	Grady	1672	" Yes - confound you - say that there 's nobody in chambers , and the party 's off for to - day . "
376091	376106	376108	376108	Grady	1672	" Shall I say that , sir ? and after I bought them bokays ? "
376113	376116	376118	376118	Amory	1236	" Yes , "
377957	377969	377971	377971	Pen	1844	" How good you are to me , Laura - sister ! "
377973	377991	377971	377971	Pen	1844	" I do n't deserve that you should - that you should be so kind to me . "
377992	377999	378000	378000	she	741	" Mamma left you to me , "
378014	378069	378071	378071	she	741	" You know you were to come to me when you were in trouble , or to tell me when you were very happy : that was our compact , Arthur , last year , before we parted . Are you very happy now , or are you in trouble - which is it ? "
378082	378107	378071	378071	she	741	" Do you like going into Parliament ! Do you intend to distinguish yourself there ? How I shall tremble for your first speech ! "
378108	378119	378120	378120	Pen	1844	" Do you know about the Parliament plan , then ? "
378123	378206	378120	378120	Pen	1844	" Know ? - all the world knows ! I have heard it talked about many times . Lady Rockminster 's doctor talked about it to - day . I daresay it will be in the Chatteris paper to - morrow . It is all over the county that Sir Francis Clavering , of Clavering , is going to retire , in behalf of Mr. Arthur Pendennis , of Fairoaks ; and that the young and beautiful Miss Blanche Amory is - - "
378207	378213	378215	378215	Pendennis	739	" What ! that too ? "
378217	378316	378215	378215	Pendennis	739	" That , too , dear Arthur . Tout se sait , as somebody would say , whom I intend to be very fond of ; and who I am sure is very clever and pretty . I have had a letter from Blanche . The kindest of letters . She speaks so warmly of you , Arthur ! I hope - I know she feels what she writes . - When is it to be , Arthur ? Why did you not tell me ? I may come and live with you then , may n't I ? "
378317	378331	378332	378332	Pen	1844	" My home is yours , dear Laura , and everything I have , "
378335	378458	378332	378332	Pen	1844	" If I did not tell you , it was because - because - I do not know : nothing is decided as yet . No words have passed between us . But you think Blanche could be happy with me - do n't you ? Not a romantic fondness , you know . I have no heart , I think ; I 've told her so : only a sober - sided attachment : - and want my wife on one side of the fire and my sister on the other , - Parliament in the session and Fairoaks in the holidays , and my Laura never to leave me until somebody who has a right comes to take her away . "
378543	378548	378549	378549	Laura	741	" Until somebody comes , "
378556	378675	378549	378549	Laura	741	" I will stay at home and be aunt Laura , and take care of the children when Blanche is in the world . I have arranged it all . I am an excellent housekeeper . Do you know I have been to market at Paris with Mrs. Beck , and have taken some lessons from M. Grandjean ? And I have had some lessons in Paris in singing too , with the money which you sent me , you kind boy : and I can sing much better now : and I have learned to dance , though not so well as Blanche ; and when you become a minister of state , Blanche shall present me : "
378741	378752	378754	378756	the old lady	14000	" So you are going to be married , sir , "
378758	378770	378771	378771	Laura	741	" Scold him , Lady Rockminster , for not telling us , "
378790	378861	378782	378784	the old lady	14000	" So you are going to marry , and to go into Parliament in place of that good - for - nothing Sir Francis Clavering . I wanted him to give my grandson his seat - why did he not give my grandson his seat ? I hope you are to have a great deal of money with Miss Amory . I would n't take her without a great deal . "
378862	378871	378872	378872	Pen	1844	" Sir Francis Clavering is tired of Parliament , "
378877	378899	378872	378872	Pen	1844	" and - and I rather wish to attempt that career . The rest of the story is at least premature . "
378900	378924	378925	378927	the old lady	14000	" I wonder , when you had Laura at home , you could take up with such an affected little creature as that , "
378930	378943	378945	378945	Pen	1844	" I am very sorry Miss Amory does not please your ladyship , "
378949	379021	378945	378945	Pen	1844	" You mean - that it is no affair of mine , and that I am not going to marry her . Well , I 'm not , and I 'm very glad I am not - a little odious thing - when I think that a man could prefer her to my Laura , I 've no patience with him , and so I tell you , Mr. Arthur Pendennis . "
379022	379035	379036	379036	Pen	1844	" I am very glad you see Laura with such favourable eyes , "
379039	379266	379036	379036	Pen	1844	" You are very glad , and you are very sorry . What does it matter , sir , whether you are very glad or very sorry ? A young man who prefers Miss Amory to Miss Bell has no business to be sorry or glad . A young man who takes up with such a crooked lump of affectation as that little Amory , - for she is crooked , I tell you she is , - after seeing my Laura , has no right to hold up his head again . Where is your friend Bluebeard ? The tall young man , I mean , - Warrington , is n't his name ? Why does he not come down , and marry Laura ? What do the young men mean by not marrying such a girl as that ? They all marry for money now . You are all selfish and cowards . We ran away with each other , and made foolish matches in my time . I have no patience with the young men ! When I was at Paris in the winter , I asked all the three attaches at the Embassy why they did not fall in love with Miss Bell ? They laughed - they said they wanted money . You are all selfish - you are all cowards . "
379267	379279	379281	379281	Pen	1865	" I hope before you offered Miss Bell to the attaches , "
379287	379297	379281	379281	Pen	1865	" you did her the favour to consult her ? "
379298	379331	379333	379335	the old dowager	12666	" Miss Bell has only a little money . Miss Bell must marry soon . Somebody must make a match for her , sir ; and a girl ca n't offer herself , "
379341	379382	379333	379335	the old dowager	12666	" Laura , my dear , I 've been telling your cousin that all the young men are selfish ; and that there is not a pennyworth of romance left among them . He is as bad as the rest . "
379383	379396	379398	379398	Laura	741	" Have you been asking Arthur why he wo n't marry me ? "
379437	379485	379414	379414	She	741	" He is going to marry somebody else ; and I intend to be very fond of her , and to go and live with them , provided he then does not ask every bachelor who comes to his house , why he does not marry me ? "
379544	379553	379554	379556	the old lady	14000	" And I recommend you to come often , "
379559	379759	379554	379556	the old lady	14000	" for Grandjean is an excellent cook , and to be with Laura and me will do your manners good . It is easy to see that you are always thinking about yourself . Do n't blush and stammer - almost all young men are always thinking about themselves . My sons and grandsons always were until I cured them . Come here , and let us teach you to behave properly ; you will not have to carve , that is done at the side - table . Hecker will give you as much wine as is good for you ; and on days when you are very good and amusing you shall have some champagne . Hecker , mind what I say . Mr. Pendennis is Miss Laura 's brother ; and you will make him comfortable , and see that he does not have too much wine , or disturb me whilst I am taking my nap after dinner . You are selfish : I intend to cure you of being selfish . You will dine here when you have no other engagements ; and if it rains you had better put up at the hotel . "
379900	379910	379912	379916	the good - natured girl	12683	" If my music can give her a nap , "
379918	379967	379912	379916	the good - natured girl	12683	" ought I not to be very glad that it can do so much good ? Lady Rockminster sleeps very little of nights : and I used to read to her until I fell ill at Paris , since when she will not hear of my sitting up . "
379968	379981	379983	379983	Pen	1865	" Why did you not write to me when you were ill ? "
379989	380048	379983	379983	Pen	1865	" What good could you do me ? I had Martha to nurse me and the doctor every day . You are too busy to write to women or to think about them . You have your books and your newspapers , and your politics and your railroads to occupy you . I wrote when I was well . "
380509	380518	380519	380522	one of the boys	12709	" Mr. Pendennis rode by to - day , "
380527	380586	380519	380522	one of the boys	12709	" with a lady , and he stopped and talked to us , and he asked for a bit of honeysuckle off the porch , and gave it the lady . I could n't see if she was pretty ; she had her veil down . She was riding one of Cramp 's horses , out of Baymouth . "
380745	380756	380757	380757	he	1844	" Other people 's children are playing on the grass , "
380766	380882	380757	380757	he	1844	" where you and I used to play , Laura . And you see how the magnolia we planted has grown up since our time . I have been round to one or two of the cottages where my mother used to visit . It is scarcely more than a year that she is gone , and the people whom she used to benefit care no more for her death than for Queen Anne 's . We are all selfish : the world is selfish : there are but a few exceptions , like you , my dear , to shine like good deeds in a naughty world , and make the blackness more dismal . "
380883	380896	380898	380898	Laura	741	" I wish you would not speak in that way , Arthur , "
380913	380930	380904	380904	her	741	" When you told the little boy to give me this , you were not selfish . "
380931	380943	380945	380946	the sneerer	12720	" A pretty sacrifice I made to get it for you ! "
380948	381150	380945	380946	the sneerer	12720	" But your heart was kind and full of love when you did so . One can not ask for more than love and kindness ; and if you think humbly of yourself Arthur , the love and kindness are - diminished - are they ? I often thought our dearest mother spoiled you at home , by worshipping you ; and that if you are - I hate the word - what you say , her too great fondness helped to make you so . And as for the world , when men go out into it , I suppose they can not be otherwise than selfish . You have to fight for yourself , and to get on for yourself , and to make a name for yourself . Mamma and your uncle both encouraged you in this ambition . If it is a vain thing , why pursue it ? I suppose such a clever man as you intend to do a great deal of good to the country , by going into Parliament , or you would not wish to be there . What are you going to do when you are in the House of Commons ? "
381151	381162	381167	381167	himself	1844	" Women do n't understand about politics , my dear , "
381172	381207	381167	381167	himself	1844	" But why do n't you make us understand ? I could never tell about Mr. Pynsent why he should like to be there so much . He is not a clever man - - "
381208	381218	381220	381220	Pen	1844	" He certainly is not a genius , Pynsent , "
381222	381422	381220	381220	Pen	1844	" Lady Diana says that he attends Committees all day ; that then again he is at the House all night ; that he always votes as he is told ; that he never speaks ; that he will never get on beyond a subordinate place ; and as his grandmother tells him , he is choked with red - tape . Are you going to follow the same career ; Arthur ? What is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it ? I would rather that you should stop at home , and write books - good books , kind books , with gentle kind thoughts , such as you have , dear Arthur , and such as might do people good to read . And if you do not win fame , what then ? You own it is vanity , and you can live very happily without it . I must not pretend to advise ; but I take you at your own word about the world ; and as you own it is wicked , and that it tires you , ask you why you do n't leave it ? "
381423	381432	381434	381434	Arthur	739	" And what would you have me do ? "
381436	381514	381434	381434	Arthur	739	" I would have you bring your wife to Fairoaks to live there , and study , and do good round about you . I would like to see your own children playing on the lawn , Arthur , and that we might pray in our mother 's church again once more , dear brother . If the world is a temptation , are we not told to pray that we may not be led into it ? "
381515	381544	381545	381545	Pen	1844	" Do you think Blanche would make a good wife for a petty country gentleman ? Do you think I should become the character very well , Laura ? "
381548	381571	381545	381545	Pen	1844	" Remember temptation walks about the hedgerows as well as the city streets : and idleness is the greatest tempter of all . "
381572	381581	381583	381583	Laura	741	" What does - does Mr. Warrington say ? "
381733	381740	381741	381741	he	1844	" Tell me something , Laura , "
381754	381761	381762	381762	she	741	" What is it , Arthur ? "

381815	381820	381821	381821	she	741	" Yes , Pen , "
381828	381837	381821	381821	she	741	" He deserved you better than I did , "
381851	381876	381839	381839	Arthur	739	" I am but a selfish wretch , and George is better , nobler , truer , than I am . God bless him ! "
381877	381882	381884	381884	Laura	741	" Yes , Pen , "
382289	382301	382302	382302	she	2051	" Oh , how wicked and proud I was about Arthur , "
382305	382387	382302	382302	she	2051	" how self - confident and unforgiving ! I never forgave from my heart this poor girl , who was fond of him , or him for encouraging her love ; and I have been more guilty than she , poor , little , artless creature ! I , professing to love one man , could listen to another only too eagerly ; and would not pardon the change of feelings in Arthur , whilst I myself was changing and unfaithful : "
382666	382687	382688	382688	she	2051	" He has a right to marry , he knows a great deal more of the world than I do , "
382693	382783	382688	382688	she	2051	" Blanche may not be so light - minded as she seemed , and who am I to be her judge ? I daresay it is very good that Arthur should go into Parliament and distinguish himself , and my duty is to do everything that lies in my power to aid him and Blanche , and to make his home happy . I daresay I shall live with them . If I am godmother to one of their children , I will leave her my three thousand pounds ! "

383028	383058	383059	383059	she	741	" She has been with old Bonner , Lady Clavering 's maid . Bonner is going to marry Lightfoot the butler . Where do you think Blanche has been ? "
383064	383075	383059	383059	she	741	" To Paris , to Scotland , to the Casino ? "
383076	383112	383114	383114	she	741	" To Shepherd 's Inn , to see Fanny ; but Fanny was n't there , and Blanche is going to leave a present for her . Is n't it kind of her and thoughtful ? "
383124	383208	383114	383114	she	741	" ' I saw Madame Mere , who was scrubbing the room , and looked at me with very scrubby looks ; but la belle Fanny was not au logis ; and as I heard that she was in Captain Strong 's apartments , Bonner and I mounted au troisieme to see this famous beauty . Another disappointment - only the Chevalier Strong and a friend of his in the room : so we came away after all without seeing the enchanting Fanny . "
383236	383246	383247	383249	A young gentleman	2892	" After dinner the doctor was reading the Times . "
383270	383275	383276	383276	I	0	" the doctor said . "
383306	383409	383590	383590	he	12749	" CHAPTER LXVIII In which the Major is bidden to Stand and Deliver Any gentleman who has frequented the Wheel of Fortune public - house , where it may be remembered that Mr. James Morgan 's Club was held , and where Sir Francis Clavering had an interview with Major Pendennis , is aware that there are three rooms for guests upon the ground floor , besides the bar where the landlady sits . One is a parlour frequented by the public at large ; to another room gentlemen in livery resort ; and the third apartment , on the door of which "
383411	383422	383590	383590	he	12749	" is painted , is that hired by the Club of "
383426	383582	383583	383583	He	12749	" of which Messrs Morgan and Lightfoot were members . The noiseless Morgan had listened to the conversation between Strong and Major Pendennis at the latter 's own lodgings , and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation ; and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the Major came to the Wheel of Fortune , and to take his place quietly in the Confidential room , whilst Pendennis and Clavering had their discourse in the parlour . There was a particular corner in the Confidential room from which you could hear almost all that passed in the next apartment ; and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry , and carried on in a high key , Morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard , strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed . "
383691	383722	383667	383667	she	1236	" Nobody saw , but a physiognomist would have liked to behold , the expression of Mr. Morgan 's countenance , when this astounding intelligence was made clear to him . "
383735	383745	383725	383726	my hage	12756	" he said , surveying himself in the glass , "
383757	384021	384022	384022	Dammy	1371	" But if he could not marry Miss Blanche and her fortune , Morgan thought he could mend his own by the possession of this information , and that it might be productive of benefit to him from very many sources . Of all the persons whom the secret affected , the greater number would not like to have it known . For instance , Sir Francis Clavering , whose fortune it involved , would wish to keep it quiet ; Colonel Altamont , whose neck it implicated , would naturally be desirous to hush it : and that young hupstart beast , Mr. Harthur , who was for getting ' into Parlyment on the strenth of it , and was as proud as if he was a duke with half a millium a year such , we grieve to say , was Morgan 's opinion of his employer 's nephew , would pay anythink sooner than let the world know that he was married to a convick 's daughter , and had got his seat in Parlyment by trafficking with this secret . As for Lady C. , Morgan thought , if she 's tired of Clavering , and wants to get rid of him , she 'll pay : if she 's frightened about her son , and fond of the little beggar , she 'll pay all the same : and Miss Blanche will certainly come down handsome to the man who will put her into her rights , which she was unjustly defrauded of them , and no mistake . "
384024	384042	384022	384022	Dammy	1371	" concluded the valet , reflecting upon this wonderful hand which luck had given him to play , "
384106	384253	384098	384099	a servant	14015	" Entertaining himself with calculations such as these , that were not a little likely to perturb a man 's spirit , Mr. Morgan showed a very great degree of self - command by appearing and being calm , and by not allowing his future prospects in any way to interfere with his present duties . One of the persons whom the story chiefly concerned , Colonel Altamont , was absent from London when Morgan was thus made acquainted with his history . The valet knew of Sir Francis Clavering 's Shepherd 's Inn haunt , and walked thither an hour or two after the Baronet and Pendennis had had their conversation together . But that bird was flown ; Colonel Altamont had received his Derby winnings , and was gone to the Continent . The fact of his absence was exceedingly vexatious to Mr. Morgan . "
384269	384273	384254	384254	He	12762	" thought Morgan , "
384304	384502	384291	384291	he	12762	" Hope , triumphant or deferred , ambition or disappointment , victory or patient ambush , Morgan bore all alike , with similar equable countenance . Until the proper day came , the Major 's boots were varnished and his hair was curled , his early cup of tea was brought to his bedside , his oaths , rebukes , and senile satire borne , with silent , obsequious fidelity . Who would think , to see him waiting upon his master , packing and shouldering his trunks , and occasionally assisting at table , at the country - houses where he might be staying , that Morgan was richer than his employer , and knew his secrets and other people 's ? In the profession Mr. Morgan was greatly respected and admired , and his reputation for wealth and wisdom got him much renown at most supper - tables : the younger gentlemen voted him stoopid , a feller of no idears , and a fogey , in a word : but not one of them would not say amen to the heartfelt prayer which some of the most serious - minded among the gentlemen uttered , "
384516	384623	384624	384628	the wild Prince and Poins	12764	" As became a man of fashion , Major Pendennis spent the autumn passing from house to house of such country friends as were at home to receive him ; and if the Duke happened to be abroad , the Marquis in Scotland , condescending to sojourn with Sir John or the plain Squire . To say the truth , the old gentleman 's reputation was somewhat on the wane : many of the men of his time had died out , and the occupants of their halls and the present wearers of their titles knew not Major Pendennis : and little cared for his traditions of "
384630	385116	384624	384628	the wild Prince and Poins	12764	" and of the heroes of fashion passed away . It must have struck the good man with melancholy as he walked by many a London door , to think how seldom it was now opened for him , and how often he used to knock at it - to what banquets and welcome he used to pass through it - a score of years back . He began to own that he was no longer of the present age , and dimly to apprehend that the young men laughed at him . Such melancholy musings must come across many a Pall Mall philosopher . The men , thinks he , are not such as they used to be in his time : the old grand manner and courtly grace of life are gone : what is Castlewood House and the present Castlewood , compared to the magnificence of the old mansion and owner ? The late lord came to London with four postchaises and sixteen horses : all the North Road hurried out to look at his cavalcade : the people in London streets even stopped as his procession passed them . The present lord travels with five bagmen in a railway carriage , and sneaks away from the station , smoking a cigar in a brougham . The late lord in autumn filled Castlewood with company , who drank claret till midnight : the present man buries himself in a hut on a Scotch mountain , and passes November in two or three closets in an entresol at Paris , where his amusements are a dinner at a cafe and a box at a little theatre . What a contrast there is between his Lady Lorraine , the Regent 's Lady Lorraine , and her little ladyship of the present era ! He figures to himself the first , beautiful , gorgeous , magnificent in diamonds and velvets , daring in rouge , the wits of the world the old wits , the old polished gentlemen - not the canaille of to - day with their language of the cabstand , and their coats smelling of smoke bowing at her feet ; and then thinks of to - day 's Lady Lorraine - a little woman in a black silk gown , like a governess , who talks astronomy , and labouring classes , and emigration , and the deuce knows what , and lurks to church at eight o'clock in the morning . Abbots - Lorraine , that used to be the noblest house in the county , is turned into a monastery - a regular La Trappe . They do n't drink two glasses of wine after dinner , and every other man at table is a country curate , with a white neckcloth , whose talk is about Polly Higson 's progress at school , or widow Watkins 's lumbago . "
385207	385212	385223	385223	'em	12776	" thinks the Major ; "
385270	385298	385263	385263	they	12776	" thought old Pendennis . And he was not far wrong ; the times and manners which he admired were pretty nearly gone - the gay young men "
385300	386688	385257	385257	they	12776	" him irreverently , whilst the serious youth had a grave pity and wonder at him ; which would have been even more painful to bear , had the old gentleman been aware of its extent . But he was rather simple : his examination of moral questions had never been very deep ; it had never struck him perhaps , until very lately , that he was otherwise than a most respectable and rather fortunate man . Is there no old age but his without reverence ? Did youthful folly never jeer at other bald pates ? For the past two or three years , he had begun to perceive that his day was well - nigh over , and that the men of the new time had begun to reign . After a rather unsuccessful autumn season , then , during which he was faithfully followed by Mr. Morgan , his nephew Arthur being engaged , as we have seen , at Clavering , it happened that Major Pendennis came back for a while to London , at the dismal end of October , when the fogs and the lawyers come to town . Who has not looked with interest at those loaded cabs , piled boxes , and crowded children , rattling through the streets on the dun October evenings ; stopping at the dark houses , where they discharge nurse and infant , girls , matron and father , whose holidays are over ? Yesterday it was France and sunshine , or Broadstairs and liberty ; to - day comes work and a yellow fog ; and , ye gods ! what a heap of bills there lies in Master 's study ! And the clerk has brought the lawyer 's papers from Chambers ; and in half an hour the literary man knows that the printer 's boy will be in the passage ; and Mr. Smith with that little account that particular little account has called presentient of your arrival , and has left word that he will call to - morrow morning at ten . Who amongst us has not said Good - bye to his holiday ; returned to dun London , and his fate ; surveyed his labours and liabilities laid out before him , and been aware of that inevitable little account to settle ? Smith and his little account in the morning , symbolise duty , difficulty , struggle , which you will meet , let us hope , friend , with a manly and honest heart . - And you think of him , as the children are slumbering once more in their own beds , and the watchful housewife tenderly pretends to sleep . Old Pendennis had no special labours or bills to encounter on the morrow , as he had no affection at home to soothe him . He had always money in his desk sufficient for his wants ; and being by nature and habit tolerably indifferent to the wants of other people , these latter were not likely to disturb him . But a gentleman may be out of temper though he does not owe a shilling and though he may be ever so selfish , he must occasionally feel dispirited and lonely . He had had two or three twinges of gout in the country - house where he had been staying : the birds were wild and shy , and the walking over the ploughed fields had fatigued him deucedly : the young men had laughed at him , and he had been peevish at table once or twice : he had not been able to get his whist of an evening : and , in fine , was glad to come away . In all his dealings with Morgan , his valet , he had been exceedingly sulky and discontented . He had sworn at him and abused him for many days past . He had scalded his mouth with bad soup at Swindon . He had left his umbrella in the railroad carriage : at which piece of forgetfulness , he was in such a rage , that he cursed Morgan more freely than ever . Both , the chimneys smoked furiously in his lodgings ; and when he caused the windows to be flung open , he swore so acrimoniously , that Morgan was inclined to fling him out of window too , through that opened casement . The valet swore after his master , as Pendennis went down the street on his way to the Club . Bays 's was not at all pleasant . The house had been new painted , and smelt of varnish and turpentine , and a large streak of white paint inflicted itself on the back of the old boy 's fur - collared surtout . The dinner was not good : and the three most odious men in all London - old Hawkshaw , whose cough and accompaniments are fit to make any man uncomfortable ; old Colonel Gripley , who seizes on all the newspapers ; and that irreclaimable old bore Jawkins , who would come and dine at the next table to Pendennis , and describe to him every inn - bill which he had paid in his foreign tour : each and all of these disagreeable personages and incidents had contributed to make Major Pendennis miserable ; and the Club waiter trod on his toe as he brought him his coffee . Never alone appear the Immortals . The Furies always hunt in company : they pursued Pendennis from home to the Club , and from the Club home . Whilst the Major was absent from his lodgings , Morgan had been seated in the landlady 's parlour , drinking freely of hot brandy - and - water , and pouring out on Mrs. Brixham some of the abuse which he had received from his master upstairs . Mrs. Brixham was Mr. Morgan 's slave . He was his landlady 's landlord . He had bought the lease of the house which she rented ; he had got her name and her son 's to acceptances , and a bill of sale which made him master of the luckless widow 's furniture . The young Brixham was a clerk in an insurance office , and Morgan could put him into what he called quod any day . Mrs. Brixham was a clergyman 's widow , and Mr. Morgan , after performing his duties on the first floor , had a pleasure in making the old lady fetch him his bootjack and his slippers . She was his slave . The little black profiles of her son and daughter ; the very picture of Tiddlecot Church , where she was married , and her poor dear Brixham lived and died , was now Morgan 's property , as it hung there over the mantelpiece of his back - parlour . Morgan sate in the widow 's back - room , in the ex - curate 's old horse - hair study - chair , making Mrs. Brixham bring supper for him , and fill his glass again and again . The liquor was bought with the poor woman 's own coin , and hence Morgan indulged in it only the more freely ; and he had eaten his supper and was drinking a third tumbler , when old Pendennis returned from the Club , and went upstairs to his rooms . Mr. Morgan swore very savagely at him and his bell , when he heard the latter , and finished his tumbler of brandy before he went up to answer the summons . He received the abuse consequent on this delay in silence , nor did the Major condescend to read in the flushed face and glaring eyes of the man , the anger under which he was labouring . The old gentleman 's foot - bath was at the fire ; his gown and slippers awaiting him there . Morgan knelt down to take his boots off with due subordination : and as the Major abused him from above , kept up a growl of maledictions below at his feet . Thus , when Pendennis was crying "
386708	386833	386834	386834	I	0	" Morgan sotto voce below was expressing a wish to strangle him , drown him , and punch his head off . The boots removed , it became necessary to divest Mr. Pendennis of his coat : and for this purpose the valet had necessarily to approach very near to his employer ; so near that Pendennis could not but perceive what Mr. Morgan 's late occupation had been ; to which he adverted in that simple and forcible phraseology which men are sometimes in the habit of using to their domestics ; informing Morgan that he was a drunken beast , and that he smelt of brandy . At this the man broke out , losing patience , and flinging up all subordination , "
386940	386941	386933	386933	you	0	" "
386955	386972	386948	386948	I	0	" said the Major , seizing up a knife that was on the table near him . "
387047	387048	387052	387052	you	0	" "
387066	387071	387052	387052	you	0	" asked the man , "
387094	387095	387098	387098	you	12787	" "
387104	387121	387098	387098	you	12787	" cried out the Major . Morgan began to laugh , with rather a sinister laugh . "
387127	387475	387125	387125	Pendennis	663	" he said , seating himself ; ' since I 've been in this room you 've called me beast , brute , dog : and d - - d me , have n't you ? How do you suppose one man likes that sort of talk from another ? How many years have I waited on you , and how many damns and cusses have you given me , along with my wages ? Do you think a man 's a dog , that you can talk to him in this way ? If I choose to drink a little , why should n't I ? I 've seen many a gentleman drunk form'ly , and peraps have the abit from them . I ai n't a - goin' to leave this house , old feller , and shall I tell you why ? The house is my house , every stick of furnitur ' in it is mine , excep ' your old traps , and your shower - bath , and your wigbox . I 've bought the place , I tell you , with my own industry and perseverance . I can show a hundred pound , where you can show a fifty , or your damned supersellious nephew either . I 've served you honourable , done everythink for you these dozen years , and I 'm a dog , am I ? I 'm a beast , am I ? That 's the language for gentlemen , not for our rank . But I 'll bear it no more . I throw up your service ; I 'm tired on it ; I 've combed your old wig and buckled your old girths and waistbands long enough , I tell you . Do n't look savage at me , I 'm sitting in my own chair , in my own room , a - telling the truth to you . I 'll be your beast , and your brute , and your dog , no more , Major Pendennis Alf Pay . "
387572	387580	387581	387582	the Major	2155	" You are no longer my servant , "
387585	387650	387581	387582	the Major	2155	" and the house may be yours ; but the lodgings are mine , and you will have the goodness to leave them . To - morrow morning , when we have settled our accounts , I shall remove into other quarters . In the meantime , I desire to go to bed , and have not the slightest wish for your further company . "
387651	387664	387665	387665	Morgan	820	" We 'll have a settlement , do n't you be afraid , "
387674	387703	387665	387665	Morgan	820	" I ai n't done with you yet ; nor with your family , nor with the Clavering family , Major Pendennis ; and that you shall know . "
387704	387719	387721	387722	the Major	2155	" Have the goodness to leave the room , sir - I 'm tired , "
387724	387739	387741	387742	the man	14896	" Hah ! you 'll be more tired of me afore you 've done , "
387878	387899	387901	387902	the Major	2155	" Gad , it 's a hard thing to lose a fellow of that sort : but he must go , "
387904	387970	387901	387902	the Major	2155	" He has grown rich , and impudent since he has grown rich . He was horribly tipsy and abusive to - night . We must part , and I must go out of the lodgings . Dammy , I like the lodgings ; I 'm used to 'em . It 's very unpleasant , at my time of life , to change my quarters . "
388015	388021	388023	388025	the old gentleman	15207	" Confound the insolent villain ! "
388027	388044	388023	388025	the old gentleman	15207	" He understood my wants to a nicety : he was the best servant in England . "
388194	388203	388206	388207	the Major	2155	" God bless my soul , Mrs. Brixham ! "
388226	388237	388206	388207	the Major	2155	" It - it 's very late , Mrs. Brixham . "
388238	388249	388251	388252	the landlady	2331	" I wish I might speak to you , sir , "
388257	388322	388251	388252	the landlady	2331	" About Morgan , I suppose ? He has cooled himself at the pump . Ca n't take him back , Mrs. Brixham . Impossible . I 'd determined to part with him before , when I heard of his dealings in the discount business - I suppose you 've heard of them , Mrs. Brixham ? My servant 's a capitalist , begad . "
388323	388328	388330	388331	Mrs. Brixham	2064	" Oh , sir , "
388333	388389	388330	388331	Mrs. Brixham	2064	" I know it to my cost . I borrowed from him a little money five years ago ; and though I have paid him many times over , I am entirely in his power . I am ruined by him , sir . Everything I had is his . He 's a dreadful man . "
388390	388428	388468	388468	he	12823	" Eh , Mrs. Brixham ? tout pis - dev'lish sorry for you , and that I must quit your house after lodging here so long : there 's no help for it . I must go . "
388429	388439	388442	388444	the luckless widow	25190	" He says we must all go , sir , "
388556	388557	388558	388559	Dev'lish sorry	12834	" "

388751	388767	388743	388743	God	1867	" said the poor woman , drying her tears . I must bear my fate . "
388768	388804	388743	388743	God	1867	" And a dev'lish hard one it is , and most sincerely I pity you , Mrs. Brixham . I - I 'll say ten pounds , if you will permit me . Good night . "
388805	388924	388743	388743	God	1867	" Mr. Morgan , sir , when he came downstairs , and when - when I besought him to have pity on me , and told him he had been the ruin of my family , said something which I did not well understand - that he would ruin every family in the house - that he knew something would bring you down too - and that you should pay him for your - your insolence to him . I - I must own to you , that I went down on my knees to him , sir ; and he said , with a dreadful oath against you , that he would have you on your knees . "
388925	388943	388743	388743	God	1867	" Me ? - by Gad , that is too pleasant ! Where is the confounded fellow ? "
388944	388977	388743	388743	God	1867	" He went away , sir . He said he should see you in the morning . Oh , pray try and pacify him , and save me and my poor boy . "
389032	389038	389040	389040	he	12844	" Me on my knees ? "
389048	389085	389040	389040	he	12844	" confound his impudence ! Who ever saw me on my knees ? What the devil does the fellow know ? Gad , I 've not had an affair these twenty years . I defy him . "
389123	389230	389116	389116	he	12845	" For it 's impossible to stay on with a valet over me , and a bankrupt landlady . What good can I do this poor devil of a woman ? I 'll give her twenty pound - there 's Warrington 's twenty pound , which he has just paid - but what 's the use ? She 'll want more , and more , and more , and that cormorant Morgan will swallow all . No , dammy , I ca n't afford to know poor people ; and to - morrow I 'll say Good - bye - to Mrs. Brixham and Mr. Morgan . "
389286	389294	389296	389298	the old fellow	21805	" It 's you , is it ? "
389303	389315	389296	389298	the old fellow	21805	" I sha n't take you back again , you understand . "
389316	389332	389333	389334	Mr. Morgan	820	" I ave not the least wish to be took back agin , Major Pendennis , "
389341	389376	389333	389334	Mr. Morgan	820	" nor to serve you nor hany man . But as I wish you to be comftable as long as you stay in my house , I came up to do what 's nessary . "
389422	389457	389408	389408	he	820	" Thinkin ' that you would most likely be in want of a respectable pusson , until you suited yourself , I spoke to a young man last night , who is ' ere . "
389458	389461	389463	389469	the warrior in the tent - bed	12850	" Indeed , "
389471	389488	389463	389469	the warrior in the tent - bed	12850	" He ave lived in the fust famlies , and I can wouch for his respectability . "
389489	389495	389497	389499	the old Major	20432	" You are monstrous polite , "
389567	389609	389618	389619	the Major	2155	" a devil of a blow hup with his own Gov'nor , and was goin' to retire from the business haltogether , and that if Frosch wanted a tempory job , he might probbly have it by applying in Bury Street . "
389610	389616	389618	389619	the Major	2155	" You are very polite , "
389621	389635	389618	389619	the Major	2155	" and your recommendation , I am sure , will have every weight . "
389653	389664	389665	389665	he	820	" The man have awaited on you before , sir , "
389671	389738	389665	389665	he	820	" Lord De la Pole , sir , gave him to his nephew young Lord Cubley , and he have been with him on his foring tour , and not wishing to go to Fitzurse Castle , which Frosch 's chest is delicate , and he can not bear the cold in Scotland , he is free to serve you or not , as you choose . "
389739	389751	389753	389754	the Major	2155	" I repeat , sir , that you are exceedingly polite , "
389779	389780	389771	389771	you	1234	" "
389819	389820	389816	389817	Major Pendennis	661	" "
389840	389841	389846	389846	sir	2261	" "
389848	389849	389846	389846	sir	2261	" "
389860	390081	389851	389851	you	2261	" Morgan withdrew ; the excessive politeness of his ex - employer made him almost as angry as the Major 's bitterest words . And whilst the old gentleman is making his mysterious toilet , we will also modestly retire . After breakfast , Major Pendennis and his new aide - de - camp occupied themselves in preparing for their departure . The establishment of the old bachelor was not very complicated . He encumbered himself with no useless wardrobe . A bible his mother 's , a road book , Pen 's novel calf elegant , and the Duke of Wellington 's Despatches , with a few prints , maps , and portraits of that illustrious general , and of various sovereigns and consorts of this country , and of the General under whom Major Pendennis had served in India , formed his literary and artistical collection : he was always ready to march at a few hours ' notice , and the cases in which he had brought his property into his lodgings some fifteen years before , were still in the lofts amply sufficient to receive all his goods . These , the young woman who did the work of the house , and who was known by the name of Betty to her mistress , and of "
390083	390241	390289	390289	I	0	" to Mr. Morgan , brought down from their resting - place , and obediently dusted and cleaned under the eyes of the terrible Morgan . His demeanour was guarded and solemn ; he had spoken no word as yet to Mrs. Brixham respecting his threats of the past night , but he looked as if he would execute them , and the poor widow tremblingly awaited her fate . Old Pendennis , armed with his cane , superintended the package of his goods and chattels , under the hands of Mr. Frosch , and the Slavey burned such of his papers as he did not care to keep ; flung open doors and closets until they were all empty ; and now all boxes and chests were closed , except his desk , which was ready to receive the final accounts of Mr. Morgan . That individual now made his appearance , and brought his books . "
390265	390272	390253	390253	you	12865	" he said , on entering . "
390294	390329	390289	390289	I	0	" said the Major . Morgan saw Frosch downstairs , watched him go along the street upon his errand , and produced his books and accounts , which were simple and very easily settled . "
390335	390362	390333	390333	sir	2261	" said he , having pocketed the cheque which his ex - employer gave him , and signed his name to his book with a flourish , "
390374	390378	390379	390379	I	0	" he said , "
390390	390428	390430	390430	I	0	" - Morgan liked the sound of his own voice ; and , as an individual , indulged in public speaking whenever he could get an opportunity , at the Club , or the housekeeper 's room - "
390444	390445	390436	390436	I	0	" "
390456	390461	390448	390448	I	0	" asked the Major . "
390516	390523	390506	390507	somebody else	14678	" Pendennis at once understood all . "
390545	390554	390532	390532	You	2261	" said the Major , looking very haughty ; "
390585	390586	390587	390587	I	0	" "
390601	390605	390598	390598	I	0	" answered Morgan . "
390692	390693	390680	390681	an Englishman	22115	" "
390722	390731	390752	390752	I	0	" asked Major Pendennis , with great majesty . "
390889	390890	390884	390884	I	0	" "
390901	390905	390893	390893	you	2261	" Pendennis asked . "
390982	390983	390984	390985	Mr. Pendennis	739	" "
390999	391006	390997	390997	sir	2261	" cried the Major , aghast . "
391018	391019	391014	391015	Miss Amory	1236	" "
391028	391033	391026	391026	Major	3335	" replied the valet ; "
391042	391043	391014	391015	Miss Amory	1236	" "
391053	391054	391045	391045	you	739	" "
391167	391168	391159	391159	your	3335	" "
391178	391227	391175	391176	you villain	12900	" cried the old gentleman . In the desk to which the valet pointed was a little double - barrelled pistol , which had belonged to Pendennis 's old patron ; the Indian commander - in - chief , and which had accompanied him in many a campaign . "
391296	391326	391290	391291	the Lord	12907	" The Major 's face glared with rage at his adversary , who looked terrified before him for a moment , and at the next , with a shriek of "
391329	391347	391290	391291	the Lord	12907	" sprang towards the open window , under which a policeman happened to be on his beat . "
391352	391384	391350	391350	Police	12908	" bellowed Mr. Morgan . To his surprise , Major Pendennis wheeled away the table and walked to the other window , which was also open . He beckoned the policeman . "
391392	391406	391390	391390	policeman	12909	" he said , and then went and placed himself against the door . "
391411	391417	391407	391407	You	12910	" he said to Morgan ; "
391488	391489	391490	391490	You	12910	" "
391502	391510	391496	391496	you	12910	" cried Morgan . The Major laughed . "
391515	391631	391511	391511	We	12917	" he said ; and the guilty valet remembered some fine lawn - fronted shirts - a certain gold - headed cane - an opera - glass , which he had forgotten to bring down , and of which he had assumed the use along with certain articles of his master 's clothes , which the old dandy neither wore nor asked for . Policeman X entered ; followed by the seared Mrs. Brixham and her maid - of - all - work , who had been at the door and found some difficulty in closing it against the street amateurs , who wished to see the row . The Major began instantly to speak . "
391642	391646	391653	391653	he	12918	" he said . "
391713	391714	391694	391694	I	0	" "
391756	391766	391746	391746	I	0	" roared Morgan , writhing with rage and terror . "
391776	391783	391767	391768	The man	14896	" the Major said , calmly . "
391813	391935	391942	391942	he	14896	" In those trunks Mr. Morgan had things which he would fain keep from public eyes . Mr. Morgan , the bill - discounter , gave goods as well as money to his customers . He provided young spendthrifts with snuff boxes and pins and jewels and pictures and cigars , and of a very doubtful quality those cigars and jewels and pictures were . Their display at a police - office , the discovery of his occult profession , and the exposure of the Major 's property , which he had appropriated , indeed , rather than stolen , - would not have added to the reputation of Mr. Morgan . He looked a piteous image of terror and discomfiture . "
391944	391949	391942	391942	he	14896	" thought the Major . "
391961	392018	391950	391950	I	0	" But he paused . He looked at poor Mrs. Brixham 's scared face ; and he thought for a moment to himself that the man brought to bay and in prison might make disclosures which had best be kept secret , and that it was best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man . "
392021	392025	392026	392026	policeman	12909	" he said , "
392037	392038	392035	392035	himself	3472	" "
392047	392052	392040	392040	you	0	" said the policeman . "
392061	392074	392040	392040	you	0	" the Major said , with a significant look at his man . "
392080	392087	392078	392078	sir	2261	" whispered Morgan , very low . "
392164	392165	392161	392161	you	820	" "
392170	392175	392161	392161	you	820	" said the man . "
392295	392296	392291	392293	an old campaigner	12939	" "
392306	392307	392299	392299	you	0	" "
392344	392345	392346	392346	Sir	2261	" "
392360	392365	392348	392348	I	0	" growled the man . "
392442	392443	392434	392434	you	2261	" "
392451	392455	392444	392444	I	0	" said Morgan ; "
392463	392464	392465	392465	Policeman	12909	" "
392467	392472	392465	392465	Policeman	12909	" cried the Major . "
392479	392483	392473	392473	You	12909	" said Morgan . "
392499	392500	392484	392484	You	12909	" "
392507	392523	392501	392501	I	0	" said the Major to X , who here entered , and who again withdrew . "
392530	392536	392526	392528	my good sir	15568	" the old gentleman continued ; "
392642	392661	392663	392663	I	0	" And Mr. Morgan wrote as he was instructed , and as the pitiless old Major continued : - "
392728	392733	392717	392717	You	12909	" said the Major . "
392738	392742	392717	392717	You	12909	" wrote Morgan . "
392756	392761	392717	392717	You	12909	" the dictator resumed , "
392890	392891	392887	392887	you	0	" "
392907	392911	392900	392900	I	0	" said Morgan . "
392933	392938	392918	392918	You	0	" the Major answered . "
392949	393052	392918	392918	You	0	" ' And having , in return for my master 's kindness , stolen his property from him , which I acknowledge to be now upstairs in my trunks ; and having uttered falsehoods regarding his and other honourable families , I do hereby , in consideration of his clemency to me , express my regret for uttering these falsehoods , and for stealing his property ; and declare that I am not worthy of belief , and that I hope ' - yes , begad - ' that I hope to amend for the future . Signed , James Morgan . ' "
393053	393065	393067	393067	Morgan	820	" I 'm d - - d if I sign it , "
393069	393088	393090	393092	the old fellow	21805	" My good man , it will happen to you , whether you sign or no , begad , "
393099	393270	393271	393271	Frosch	1234	" There , I shall not use this , you understand , unless - unless I am compelled to do so . Mrs. Brixham , and our friend the policeman , will witness it , I dare say , without reading it : and I will give the old lady back her note of hand , and say , which you will confirm , that she and you are quits . I see there is Frosch come back with the cab for my trunks ; I shall go to an hotel . - You may come in now , policeman ; Mr. Morgan and I have arranged our little dispute . If Mrs. Brixham will sign this paper , and you , policeman , will do so , I shall be very much obliged to you both . Mrs. Brixham , you and your worthy landlord , Mr. Morgan , are quits . I wish you joy of him . Let Frosch come and pack the rest of the things . "
393512	393522	393523	393523	he	820	" My uncle out , I suppose , Morgan ? "
393545	393553	393555	393555	Morgan	820	" Major Pendennis is hout , sir , "
393572	393600	393555	393555	Morgan	820	" Major Pendennis have left this ouse to - day , sir , and I have no longer the honour of being in his service , sir . "
393601	393609	393526	393527	the functionary	12980	" Indeed , and where is he ? "
393610	393627	393629	393630	Mr. Morgan	820	" I believe he ave taken tempory lodgings at Cox 's otel , in Jummin Street , "
393639	393686	393629	393630	Mr. Morgan	820	" Are you in town for some time , pray , sir ? Are you in Chambers ? I should like to have the honour of waiting on you there : and would be thankful if you would favour me with a quarter of an hour . "
393687	393698	393700	393700	Arthur	661	" Do you want my uncle to take you back ? "
393708	393721	393722	393723	The man	14896	" I want no such thing ; I 'd see him - - "
393735	393743	393744	393744	he	661	" No , sir , thank you , "
393751	393782	393744	393744	he	661	" it 's only with you that I wish to speak , on some business which concerns you ; and perhaps you would favour me by walking into my house . "
393783	393802	393804	393804	Arthur	661	" If it is but for a minute or two , I will listen to you , Morgan , "
393811	393822	393824	393824	he	661	" I suppose the fellow wants me to patronise him ; "
394081	394087	394067	394067	Warrington	1359	" Well , young one ! "
394099	394107	394088	394089	Pen advanced	1844	" How are you , old boy ? "
394173	394179	394152	394152	Max	2073	" Well , young one ! "
394180	394188	394191	394192	two Britons	13006	" How are you , old boy ? "
394315	394327	394329	394329	Hardman	2076	" Yes , we are not demonstrative like those confounded foreigners , "
394347	394352	394354	394354	Pen	1844	" Been in Switzerland ? "
394356	394359	394361	394361	Warrington	1359	" Yes , "
394363	394386	394361	394361	Warrington	1359	" Could n't find a bit of tobacco fit to smoke till we came to Strasburg , where I got some caporal . "
394676	394692	394694	394694	Warrington	1359	" And the seat in Parliament , Pen ? Have you made it all right ? "
394696	394724	394726	394726	Pen	1844	" All right , - as soon as Parliament meets and a new writ can be issued , Clavering retires , and I step into his shoes , "
394728	394739	394741	394741	Warrington	1359	" And under which king does Bezonian speak or die ? "
394743	394763	394726	394726	Pen	1844	" Do we come out as Liberal Conservative , or as Government man , or on our own hook ? "
394764	394877	394694	394694	Warrington	1359	" Hem ! There are no politics now ; every man 's politics , at least , are pretty much the same . I have not got acres enough to make me a Protectionist ; nor could I be one , I think , if I had all the land in the county . I shall go pretty much with Government , and in advance of them upon some social questions which I have been getting up during the vacation ; - do n't grin , you old cynic , I have been getting up the Blue Books , and intend to come out rather strong on the Sanitary and Colonisation questions . "
394878	394968	394988	394988	his	1844	" We reserve to ourselves the liberty of voting against Government , though we are generally friendly . We are , however , friends of the people avant tout . We give lectures at the Clavering Institute , and shake bands with the intelligent mechanics . We think the franchise ought to be very considerably enlarged ; at the same time we are free to accept office some day , when the House has listened to a few crack speeches from us , and the Administration perceives our merit . "
394969	394975	394977	394977	Pen	1844	" I am not Moses , "
394991	395255	394977	394977	Pen	1844	" I have no laws from Heaven to bring down to the people from the mountain . I do n't belong to the mountain at all , or set up to be a leader and reformer of mankind . My faith is not strong enough for that ; nor my vanity , nor my hypocrisy , great enough . I will tell no lies , George , that I promise you ; and do no more than coincide in those which are necessary and pass current , and ca n't be got in without recalling the whole circulation . Give a man at least the advantage of his sceptical turn . If I find a good thing to say in the House , I will say it ; a good measure , I will support it ; a fair place , I will take it , and be glad of my luck . But I would no more flatter a great man than a mob ; and now you know as much about my politics as I do . What call have I to be a Whig ? Whiggism is not a divine institution . Why not vote with the Liberal Conservatives ? They have done for the nation what the Whigs would never have done without them . Who converted both ? - the Radicals and the country outside . I think the Morning Post is often right , and Punch is often wrong . I do n't profess a call , but take advantage of a chance . Parlons d'autre chose . "
395256	395272	395273	395273	Warrington	1359	" The next thing at your heart , after ambition is love , I suppose ? "
395276	395314	395273	395273	Warrington	1359	" How have our young loves prospered ? Are we going to change our condition , and give up our chambers ? Are you going to divorce me , Arthur , and take unto yourself a wife ? "
395315	395384	395386	395386	Arthur	739	" I suppose so . She is very good - natured and lively . She sings , and she do n't mind smoking . She 'll have a fair fortune - I do n't know how much - but my uncle augurs everything from the Begum 's generosity , and says that she will come down very handsomely . And I think Blanche is dev'lish fond of me , "
395392	395404	395386	395386	Arthur	739	" That means that we accept her caresses and her money . "
395405	395417	395418	395418	Pendennis	739	" Have n't we said before that life was a transaction ? "
395421	395539	395418	395418	Pendennis	739	" I do n't pretend to break my heart about her . I have told her pretty fairly what my feelings are - and - and have engaged myself to her . And since I saw her last , and for the last two months especially , whilst I have been in the country , I think she has been growing fonder and fonder of me ; and her letters to me , and especially to Laura , seem to show it . Mine have been simple enough - no raptures , nor vows , you understand - but looking upon the thing as an affaire faite ; and not desirous to hasten or defer the completion . "
395540	395548	395549	395549	Warrington	1359	" And Laura ? how is she ? "
395553	395558	395560	395560	Pen	1844	" Laura , George , "
395570	395591	395560	395560	Pen	1844	" by heaven , Laura is the best , and noblest , and dearest girl the sun ever shone upon . "
395628	395640	395641	395641	Warrington	1359	" Have you only found out that now , young un ? "
395647	395658	395660	395660	Arthur	739	" Who has not learned things too late , George ? "
395676	395864	395663	395663	his	739	" Whose life is not a disappointment ? Who carries his heart entire to the grave without a mutilation ? I never knew anybody who was happy quite : or who has not had to ransom himself out of the hands of Fate with the payment of some dearest treasure or other . Lucky if we are left alone afterwards , when we have paid our fine , and if the tyrant visits us no more . Suppose I have found out that I have lost the greatest prize in the world , now that it ca n't be mine - that for years I had an angel under my tent , and let her go ? - am I the only one - ah , dear old boy , am I the only one ? And do you think my lot is easier to bear because I own that I deserve it ? She 's gone from us . God 's blessing be with her ! She might have stayed , and I lost her ; it 's like Undine : is n't it , George ? "
395865	395873	395875	395875	George	1359	" She was in this room once , "
396039	396072	396073	396074	the Major	2155	" I should like to see you in Parliament , and snugly settled with a comfortable house and an heir to the name before I make my bow . Show me these , "
396077	396102	396073	396074	the Major	2155	" and then , let old Arthur Pendennis make room for the younger fellows ; he has walked the Pall Mall pave long enough . "
396103	396113	396115	396115	Warrington	1359	" There is a kindness about the old heathen , "
396117	396224	396073	396074	the Major	2155	" He cares for somebody besides himself , at least for some other part of himself besides that which is buttoned into his own coat ; - for you and your race . He would like to see the progeny of the Pendennises multiplying and increasing , and hopes that they may inherit the land . The old patriarch blesses you from the Club window of Bays 's , and is carried off and buried under the flags of St. James 's Church , in sight of Piccadilly , and the cabstand , and the carriages going to the levee . It is an edifying ending . "
396225	396235	396237	396237	Pen	1844	" The new blood I bring into the family , "
396239	396390	396237	396237	Pen	1844	" is rather tainted . If I had chosen , I think my father - in - law Amory would not have been the progenitor I should have desired for my race ; nor my grandfather - in - law Snell ; nor our Oriental ancestors . By the way , who was Amory ? Amory was lieutenant of an Indiaman . Blanche wrote some verses about him , about the storm , the mountain wave , the seaman 's grave , the gallant father , and that sort of thing . Amory was drowned commanding a country ship between Calcutta and Sydney ; Amory and the Begum were n't happy together . She has been unlucky in her selection of husbands , the good old lady , for , between ourselves , a more despicable creature than Sir Francis Clavering , of Clavering Park , Baronet , never - - "
396391	396398	396401	396401	Warrington	1359	" Never legislated for his country , "
396409	396417	396419	396419	Warrington	1359	" By the way , at Baden , "
396421	396569	396419	396419	Warrington	1359	" I found our friend the Chevalier Strong in great state , and wearing his orders . He told me that he had quarrelled with Clavering , of whom he seemed to have almost as bad an opinion as you have , and in fact , I think , though I will not be certain , confided to me his opinion , that Clavering was an utter scoundrel . That fellow Bloundell , who taught you card - playing at Oxbridge , was with Strong ; and time , I think , has brought out his valuable qualities , and rendered him a more accomplished rascal than he was during your undergraduateship . But the king of the place was the famous Colonel Altamont , who was carrying all before him , giving flies to the whole society , and breaking the bank , it was said . "
396570	396607	396611	396611	his	13035	" My uncle knows something about that fellow - Clavering knows something about him . There 's something louche regarding him . But come ! I must go to Bury Street , like a dutiful nephew . "
396619	396626	396628	396628	Warrington	1359	" I will walk , too , "
396685	396706	396708	396708	Warrington	1359	" What is the matter ? You 've not been smoking . Is it my pipe that has poisoned you ? "
396710	396720	396722	396722	Pen	1844	" I am going to call upon some women , "
396724	396751	396752	396752	Warrington	1359	" I 'm - I 'm going to dine with 'em . They are passing through town , and are at an hotel in Jermyn Street . "
396826	396832	396834	396834	he	1359	" Well , young un , "
396838	396908	396834	396834	he	1359	" I like you to be a buck ; somehow . When I walk about with you , it is as if I had a rose in my button - hole . And you are still affable . I do n't think there is any young fellow in the Temple turns out like you ; and I do n't believe you were ever ashamed of walking with me yet . "
396909	396918	396920	396920	Pen	1844	" Do n't laugh at me , George . "
396922	396928	396930	396931	the other	14365	" I say , Pen , "
396935	396959	396960	396960	Pen	1844	" if you write - if you write to Laura , I wish you would say ' God bless her ' from me . "
396982	396991	396992	396992	he	14365	" I 'm going to dine with her , "
396995	397051	396992	396992	he	14365	" I brought her and Lady Rockminster up from the country to - day - made two days of it - slept last night at Bath - I say , George , come and dine , too . I may ask any one I please , and the old lady is constantly talking about you . "
397141	397154	397155	397157	old Lady Rockminster	1218	" You will go and see your uncle now , Mr. Pendennis , "
397160	397222	397155	397157	old Lady Rockminster	1218	" You will not bring him to dinner - no - his old stories are intolerable ; and I want to talk to Mr. Warrington ; I daresay he will amuse us . I think we have heard all your stories . We have been together for two whole days , and I think we are getting tired of each other . "
397313	397328	397329	397329	he	739	" I have heard the most extraordinary news ; I will tell you afterwards , "
397347	397361	397362	397363	Lady Rockminster	1218	" Do n't tramp and beat so with your feet under the table , "
397366	397387	397362	397363	Lady Rockminster	1218	" You have trodden on Fido , and upset his saucer . You see Mr. Warrington keeps his boots quiet . "
397408	397473	397404	397405	Lady Rockminster	1218	" This dinner has been exceedingly stupid . I suppose something has happened , and that you want to speak to Laura . I will go and have my nap . I am not sure that I shall have any tea - no . Good night , Mr. Warrington . You must come again , and when there is no business to talk about . "
397513	397516	397503	397503	Warrington	1359	" Good night "
397537	397569	397534	397534	Arthur	739	" Pray , stay , George . You should hear my news too , and give me your counsel in this case . I hardly know how to act in it . "
397570	397579	397581	397581	Laura	741	" It 's something about Blanche , Arthur , "
397602	397611	397613	397613	Pen	1844	" Yes - and the most extraordinary story , "
397615	397828	397613	397613	Pen	1844	" When I left you to go to my uncle 's lodgings , I found his servant , Morgan , who has been with him so long , at the door , and he said that he and his master had parted that morning ; that my uncle had quitted the house , and had gone to an hotel - this hotel . I asked for him when I came in ; but he was gone out to dinner . Morgan then said that he had something of a most important nature to communicate to me , and begged me to step into the house ; his house it is now . It appears the scoundrel has saved a great deal of money whilst in my uncle 's service , and is now a capitalist and a millionaire , for what I know . Well , I went into the house , and what do you think he told me ? This must be a secret between us all - at least if we can keep it , now that it is in possession of that villain . Blanche 's father is not dead . He has come to life again . The marriage between Clavering and the Begum is no marriage . "
397829	397842	397844	397844	Warrington	1359	" And Blanche , I suppose , is her grandfather 's heir , "
397846	397900	397844	397844	Warrington	1359	" Perhaps : but the child of what a father ! Amory is an escaped convict - Clavering knows it ; my uncle knows it - and it was with this piece of information held over Clavering in terrorem that the wretched old man got him to give up his borough to me . "
397901	397908	397910	397910	Laura	741	" Blanche does n't know it , "
397912	397918	397910	397910	Laura	741	" nor poor Lady Clavering ? "
397919	397922	397924	397924	Pen	1844	" No , "
397926	398131	397924	397924	Pen	1844	" Blanche does not even know the history of her father . She knew that he and her mother had separated , and had heard as a child , from Bonner , her nurse , that Mr. Amory was drowned in New South Wales . He was there as a convict , not as a ship's - captain , as the poor girl thought . Lady Clavering has told me that they were not happy , and that her husband was a bad character . She would tell me all , she said , some day : and I remember her saying to me , with tears in her eyes , that it was hard for a woman to be forced to own that she was glad to hear her husband was dead : and that twice in her life she should have chosen so badly . What is to be done now ? The man ca n't show and claim his wife : death is probably over him if he discovers himself : return to transportation certainly . But the rascal has held the threat of discovery over Clavering for some time past , and has extorted money from him time after time . "
398132	398143	398145	398145	Warrington	1359	" It is our friend Colonel Altamont , of course , "
398146	398152	397924	397924	Pen	1844	" I see all now . "
398153	398160	398162	398162	Arthur	739	" If the rascal comes back , "
398164	398206	398208	398208	Pen	1844	" Morgan , who knows his secret , will use it over him - and having it in his possession , proposes to extort money from us all . The d - - d rascal supposed I was cognisant of it , "
398214	398289	398208	398208	Pen	1844	" asked me if I would give him an annuity to keep it quiet ; threatened me , me , as if I was trafficking with this wretched old Begum 's misfortune , and would extort a seat in Parliament out of that miserable Clavering . Good heavens ! was my uncle mad , to tamper in such a conspiracy ? Fancy our mother 's son , Laura , trading on such a treason ! "
398290	398300	398302	398302	Laura	741	" I ca n't fancy it , dear Arthur , "
398313	398316	398319	398319	Warrington	1359	" No ! "
398346	398494	398495	398495	He	13056	" No . Our boy ca n't meddle with such a wretched intrigue as that . Arthur Pendennis ca n't marry a convict 's daughter ; and sit in Parliament as member for the hulks . You must wash your hands of the whole affair , Pen . You must break off . You must give no explanations of why and wherefore , but state that family reasons render a match impossible . It is better that those poor women should fancy you false to your word than that they should know the truth . Besides , you can get from that dog Clavering - I can fetch that for you easily enough an acknowledgment that the reasons which you have given to him as the head of the family are amply sufficient for breaking off the union . Do n't you think with me , Laura ? "
398592	398602	398604	398604	George	1359	" She thinks so too - God bless her ! "
398606	398623	398624	398624	Laura	741	" Her father 's shame is not Blanche 's fault , dear Arthur , is it ? "
398635	398691	398624	398624	Laura	741	" Suppose you had been married , would you desert her because she had done no wrong ? Are you not pledged to her ? Would you leave her because she is in misfortune ? And if she is unhappy , would n't you console her ? Our mother would , had she been here . "
398715	398724	398725	398725	Pen	1844	" Our mother is an angel with God , "
398729	398777	398725	398725	Pen	1844	" And you are the dearest and best of women - the dearest , the dearest and the best . Teach me my duty . Pray for me that I may do it - pure heart . God bless you - God bless you , my sister ! "
398778	398781	398784	398784	Warrington	1359	" Amen , "
398793	398798	398799	398799	he	1359	" She is right , "
398804	398818	398799	398799	he	1359	" She ca n't do any wrong , I think - that girl . "
398884	398891	398892	398892	she	13060	" And now , and now , "
398901	398906	398908	398908	George	1359	" And what now ? "
398910	398919	398921	398922	Miss Laura	741	" And now we will have some tea , "
398987	399010	398982	398982	Pen	1844	" Behave yourself well - hold to the right , and do your duty - be gentle , but firm with your uncle "
399118	399133	399135	399135	he	1359	" In which of those many windows of the hotel does her light beam ? "
399407	399689	399392	399394	The old gentleman	15207	" The confounded impudent scoundrel ! He was drunk last night , and challenged me to fight him , Pen ; and , begad , at one time I was so excited that I thought I should have driven a knife into him ; and the infernal rascal has made ten thousand pound , I believe - and deserves to be hanged , and will be ; but , curse him , I wish he could have lasted out my time . He knew all my ways , and , dammy , when I rang the bell , the confounded thief brought the thing I wanted - not like that stupid German lout . And what sort of time have you had in the country ? Been a good deal with Lady Rockminster ? You ca n't do better . She is one of the old school - vieille ecole , bonne ecole , hey ? Dammy , they do n't make gentlemen and ladies now ; and in fifty years you 'll hardly know one man from another . But they 'll last my time . I ai n't long for this business : I am getting very old , Pen , my boy ; and , gad , I was thinking to - day , as I was packing up my little library , there 's a bible amongst the books that belonged to my poor mother ; I would like you to keep that , Pen . I was thinking , sir , that you would most likely open the box when it was your property , and the old fellow was laid under the sod , sir , "
399766	399777	399779	399780	the Elder	3112	" Hey - hey - I 'm off , sir , "
399782	399899	399900	399900	His	13090	" but I 'd like to read a speech of yours in the Times before I go - ' Mr. Pendennis said , Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking ' - hey , sir ? hey , Arthur ? Begad , you look dev'lish well and healthy , sir . I always said my brother Jack would bring the family right . You must go down into the west , and buy the old estate , sir . Nec tenui penna , hey ? We 'll rise again , sir - rise again on the wing - and , begad , I should n't be surprised that you will be a Baronet before you die . "
399905	399911	399912	399912	he	1844	" And it is I , "
399915	399959	399912	399912	he	1844	" that am going to fling down the poor old fellow 's air - castle . Well , it must be . Here goes . - I - I went into your lodgings at Bury Street , though I did not find you , "
399964	399973	399960	399960	Pen	1844	" and I talked with Morgan , uncle . "
399974	399977	399978	399980	The old gentleman	15207	" Indeed ! "
399992	400004	399989	399989	he	15207	" The cat 's out of the bag now , begad ! "
400005	400023	400025	400025	Pen	1844	" He told me a story , sir , which gave me the deepest surprise and pain , "
400034	400051	400027	400028	The Major	2155	" What - that story about - about - What - d'-you - call-'em , hey ? "
400052	400074	399989	399989	he	15207	" About Miss Amory 's father - about Lady Clavering 's first husband , and who he is , and what . "
400075	400083	400085	400087	the old man	14049	" Hem - a dev'lish awkward affair ! "
400093	400111	400085	400087	the old man	14049	" I - I 've been aware of that - eh - confounded circumstance for some time . "
400112	400126	400128	400128	Arthur	739	" I wish I had known it sooner , or not at all , "
400132	400138	400140	400141	the Senior	3246	" He is all safe , "
400146	400178	400140	400141	the Senior	3246	" Gad ! I should have liked to keep it from you altogether - and from those two poor women , who are as innocent as unborn babes in the transaction . "
400179	400212	400213	400213	Arthur	739	" You are right . There is no reason why the two women should hear it ; and I shall never tell them - though that villain , Morgan , perhaps may , "
400218	400269	400213	400213	Arthur	739	" He seems disposed to trade upon his secret , and has already proposed terms of ransom to me . I wish I had known of the matter earlier , sir . It is not a very pleasant thought to me that I am engaged to a convict 's daughter . "
400270	400363	400140	400141	the Senior	3246	" The very reason why I kept it from you - my dear boy . But Miss Amory is not a convict 's daughter , do n't you see ? Miss Amory is the daughter of Lady Clavering , with fifty or sixty thousand pounds for a fortune ; and her father - in - law , a Baronet and country gentleman , of high reputation , approves of the match , and gives up his seat in Parliament to his son - in - law . What can be more simple ? "
400364	400371	400213	400213	Arthur	739	" Is it true , sir ? "
400372	400474	400475	400477	The old gentleman	15207	" Begad , yes , it is true , of course it 's true . Amory 's dead . I tell you he is dead . The first sign of life he shows , he is dead . He ca n't appear . We have him at a deadlock , like the fellow in the play - the ' Critic , ' hey ? - dev'lish amusing play , that ' Critic . ' Monstrous witty man , Sheridan ; and so was his son . By Gad , sir , when I was at the Cape , I remember - - "
400515	400564	400508	400508	Arthur	739	" If you had told me this tale sooner , I believe you would have spared me and yourself a great deal of pain and disappointment ; and I should not have found myself tied to an engagement from which I ca n't , in honour , recede . "
400565	400612	400614	400616	the old man	14049	" No , begad , we 've fixed you - and a man who 's fixed to a seat in Parliament , and a pretty girl , with a couple of thousand a year , is fixed to no bad thing , let me tell you , "
400618	400624	400626	400626	Arthur	739	" Great Heavens , sir ! "
400628	400638	400626	400626	Arthur	739	" are you blind ? Ca n't you see ? "
400639	400646	400648	400649	the other	14365	" See what , young gentleman ? "
400651	400665	400648	400649	the other	14365	" See , that rather than trade upon this secret of Amory 's , "
400670	400807	400666	400666	Arthur	739	" I would go and join my father - in - law at the hulks ! See , that rather than take a seat in Parliament as a bribe from Clavering for silence , I would take the spoons off the table ! See , that you have given me a felon 's daughter for a wife ; doomed me to poverty and shame ; cursed my career when it might have been - when it might have been so different but for you ! Do n't you see that we have been playing a guilty game , and have been overreached ; - that in offering to marry this poor girl , for the sake of her money , and the advancement she would bring , I was degrading myself , and prostituting my honour ? "
400808	400820	400822	400824	the old man	14049	" What in Heaven 's name do you mean , sir ? "
400826	400844	400845	400845	Arthur	739	" I mean to say that there is a measure of baseness which I ca n't pass , "
400848	400912	400845	400845	Arthur	739	" I have no other words for it , and am sorry if they hurt you . I have felt , for months past , that my conduct in this affair has been wicked , sordid , and worldly . I am rightly punished by the event , and having sold myself for money and a seat in Parliament , by losing both . "
400913	400923	400925	400927	the old gentleman	15207	" How do you mean that you lose either ? "
400929	400966	400925	400927	the old gentleman	15207	" Who the devil 's to take your fortune or your seat away from you ? By G - , Clavering shall give 'em to you . You shall have every shilling of eighty thousand pounds . "
400967	400979	400981	400981	Arthur	739	" I 'll keep my promise to Miss Amory , sir , "
400983	400996	400981	400981	Arthur	739	" And , begad , her parents shall keep theirs to you . "
400997	401004	401005	401005	Arthur	739	" Not so , please God , "
401008	401090	401005	401005	Arthur	739	" I have sinned , but , Heaven help me , I will sin no more . I will let Clavering off from that bargain which was made without my knowledge . I will take no money with Blanche but that which was originally settled upon her ; and I will try to make her happy . You have done it . You have brought this on me , sir . But you knew no better : and I forgive - - "
401091	401227	401229	401231	the old man	14049	" Arthur - in God 's name - in your father 's , who , by Heavens , was the proudest man alive , and had the honour of the family always at heart - in mine - for the sake of a poor broken - down old fellow , who has always been dev'lish fond of you - do n't fling this chance away - I pray you , I beg you , I implore you , my dear , dear boy , do n't fling this chance away . It 's the making of you . You 're sure to get on . You 'll be a Baronet ; it 's three thousand a year : dammy , on my knees , there , I beg of you , do n't do this . "
401280	401285	401287	401287	Arthur	739	" Ah , sir , "
401293	401333	401287	401287	Arthur	739	" you have brought pain enough on me , spare me this . You have wished me to marry Blanche . I marry her . For God 's sake , sir , rise ! I ca n't bear it . "
401334	401355	401357	401359	the old gentleman	15207	" You - you mean to say that you will take her as a beggar , and be one yourself ? "
401367	401449	401357	401359	the old gentleman	15207	" I look at her as a person to whom a great calamity has befallen , and to whom I am promised . She can not help the misfortune ; and as she had my word when she was prosperous , I shall not withdraw it now she is poor . I will not take Clavering 's seat , unless afterwards it should be given of his free will . I will not have a shilling more than her original fortune . "
401450	401459	401461	401463	the old gentleman	15207	" Have the kindness to ring the bell , "
401465	401556	401461	401463	the old gentleman	15207	" I have done my best , and said my say ; and I 'm a dev'lish old fellow . And - and - it do n't matter . And - and Shakspeare was right - and Cardinal Wolsey - begad - ' and had I but served my God as I 've served you ' - yes , on my knees , by Jove , to my own nephew - I might n't have been - Good night , sir , you need n't trouble yourself to call again . "
401739	401755	401756	401757	Mrs. Flanagan	1374	" I found him at the table , when I came , the dear gentleman ! "
401760	401792	401756	401757	Mrs. Flanagan	1374	" writing at his papers , and one of the candles was burned out ; and hard as his bed is , he was n't in it all night , sir . "
402560	402589	402590	402590	I	0	" Dear Pen , - I shall be half - way home when you breakfast , and intend to stay over Christmas , in Norfolk , or elsewhere . "
402619	402624	402614	402614	my	0	" Vale . G. W. "
402625	402637	402640	402640	George	1359	" Give my very best regards and adieux to your cousin . "
402706	402711	402712	402712	Pen	799	" Bluebeard is gone , "
402925	402934	402937	402937	Pen	799	" What , Foker ! Hail , Foker ! "
403123	403133	403135	403135	Arthur	739	" Le Roi est mort . Vive le Roi ! "
403137	403140	403142	403143	the other	14365	" Ah ! "
403145	403170	403142	403143	the other	14365	" Yes . Thank you - very much obliged . How do you do , Pen ? - very busy - good - bye ! "
403230	403238	403240	403240	Pen	799	" Yes : so wags the world , "
403242	403381	403240	403240	Pen	799	" The stone closes over Harry the Fourth , and Harry the Fifth reigns in his stead . The old ministers at the brewery come and kneel before him with their books ; the draymen , his subjects , fling up their red caps , and shout for him . What a grave deference and sympathy the bankers and the lawyers show ! There was too great a stake at issue between those two that they should ever love each other very cordially . As long as one man keeps another out of twenty thousand a year , the younger must be always hankering after the crown , and the wish must be the father to the thought of possession . Thank Heaven , there was no thought of money between me and our dear mother , Laura . "
403382	403395	403397	403397	Laura	741	" There never could have been . You would have spurned it ! "
403399	403445	403446	403446	her	741	" Why make yourself more selfish than you are , Pen ; and allow your mind to own for an instant that it would have entertained such - such dreadful meanness ? You make me blush for you , Arthur : you make me - - "
403460	403471	403453	403453	she	741	" There are some truths which women will never acknowledge , "
403475	403517	403472	403472	Pen	799	" and from which your modesty always turns away . I do not say that I ever knew the feeling , only that I am glad I had not the temptation . Is there any harm in that confession of weakness ? "
403518	403533	403535	403535	Laura	741	" We are all taught to ask to be delivered from evil , Arthur , "
403542	403709	403535	403535	Laura	741	" I am glad if you were spared from that great crime ; and only sorry to think that you could by any possibility have been led into it . But you never could ; and you do n't think you could . Your acts are generous and kind : you disdain mean actions . You take Blanche without money , and without a bribe . Yes , thanks be to Heaven , dear brother . You could not have sold yourself away ; I knew you could not when it came to the day , and you did not . Praise be - be where praise is due . Why does this horrid scepticism pursue you , my Arthur ? Why doubt and sneer at your own heart - at every one 's ? Oh , if you knew the pain you give me - how I lie awake and think of those hard sentences , dear brother , and wish them unspoken , unthought ! "
403710	403723	403725	403725	Arthur	739	" Do I cause you many thoughts and many tears , Laura ? "
403792	403804	403805	403805	he	739	" I - I do n't know what I have done , "
403810	403893	403894	403894	he	739	" to have merited such regard from two such women . It is like undeserved praise , Laura - or too much good fortune , which frightens one - or a great post , when a man feels that he is not fit for it . Ah , sister , how weak and wicked we are ; how spotless , and full of love and truth , Heaven made you ! I think for some of you there has been no fall , "
403910	403935	403894	403894	he	739	" You ca n't help having sweet thoughts , and doing good actions . Dear creature ! they are the flowers which you bear . "
403936	403943	403945	403945	Laura	741	" And what else , sir ? "
403947	403973	403945	403945	Laura	741	" I see a sneer coming over your face . What is it ? Why does it come to drive all the good thoughts away ? "
403974	404004	403894	403894	he	739	" A sneer , is there ? I was thinking , my dear , that nature in making you so good and loving did very well : but - - "
404005	404024	403894	403894	he	739	" But what ? What is that wicked but ? and why are you always calling it up ? "
404025	404174	404175	404175	Pen	799	" But will come in spite of us . But is reflection . But is the sceptic 's familiar , with whom he has made a compact ; and if he forgets it , and indulges in happy day - dreams , or building of air - castles , or listens to sweet music let us say , or to the bells ringing to church , But taps at the door , and says , Master , I am here . You are my master ; but I am yours . Go where you will you ca n't travel without me . I will whisper to you when you are on your knees at church . I will be at your marriage pillow . I will sit down at your table with your children . I will be behind your deathbed curtain . That is what But is , "
404178	404185	404187	404187	Laura	741	" Pen , you frighten me , "
404189	404268	404269	404269	he	799	" Do you know what But came and said to me just now , when I was looking at you ? But said , If that girl had reason as well as love , she would love you no more . If she knew you as you are - the sullied , selfish being which you know - she must part from you , and could give you no love and no sympathy . Did n't I say , "
404273	404298	404269	404269	he	799	" that some of you seem exempt from the fall ? Love you know ; but the knowledge of evil is kept from you . "
404299	404310	404312	404313	Lady Rockminster	1218	" What is this you young folks are talking about ? "
404364	404374	404385	404385	Arthur	739	" Mr. Pendennis , you are always coming here . "
404375	404384	404385	404385	Arthur	739	" It is very pleasant to be here , "
404388	404426	404385	404385	Arthur	739	" and we were talking , when you came in , about my friend Foker , whom I met just now ; and who , as your ladyship knows , has succeeded to his father 's kingdom . "
404427	404462	404464	404465	Lady Rockminster	1218	" He has a very fine property , he has fifteen thousand a year . He is my cousin . He is a very worthy young man . He must come and see me , "
404473	404486	404487	404487	Lady	2753	" He has been engaged for many years past to his cousin , "
404490	404491	404487	404487	Lady	2753	" "
404500	404509	404495	404498	a foolish little chit	13181	" Lady Rockminster said , with much dignity ; "
404542	404543	404526	404526	She	1717	" "
404551	404555	404526	404526	She	1717	" asked Pen . "
404584	404601	404602	404602	I	0	" said Lady Rockminster , who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject . "
404963	405547	404950	404950	Grindley	2090	" To the latter part of her ladyship 's speech Arthur gave no ear . He was thinking for whom could Foker be purchasing those trinkets which he was carrying away from the jeweller 's ? Why did Harry seem anxious to avoid him ? Could he be still faithful to the attachment which had agitated him so much , and sent him abroad eighteen months back ? Psha ! The bracelets and presents were for some of Harry 's old friends of the Opera or the French theatre . Rumours from Naples and Paris , rumours such as are borne to Club smoking - rooms , had announced that the young man had found distractions ; or , precluded from his virtuous attachment , the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusements - not the only man or woman whom society forces into evil , or debars from good ; not the only victim of the world 's selfish and wicked laws . As a good thing when it is to be done can not be done too quickly , Laura was anxious that Pen 's marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible , and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety . Why could she not wait ? Pen could afford to do so with perfect equanimity , but Laura would hear of no delay . She wrote to Pen : she implored Pen : she used every means to urge expedition . It seemed as if she could have no rest until Arthur 's happiness was complete . She offered herself to dearest Blanche to come and stay at Tunbridge with her , when Lady Rockminster should go on her intended visit to the reigning house of Rockminster ; and although the old dowager scolded , and ordered , and commanded , Laura was deaf and disobedient : she must go to Tunbridge , she would go to Tunbridge : she who ordinarily had no will of her own , and complied smilingly with anybody 's whim and caprices , showed the most selfish and obstinate determination in this instance . The dowager lady must nurse herself in her rheumatism , she must read herself to sleep , if she would not hear her maid , whose voice croaked , and who made sad work of the sentimental passages in the novels - Laura must go , - and be with her new sister . In another week , she proposed , with many loves and regards to dear Lady Clavering , to pass some time with dearest Blanche . Dearest Blanche wrote instantly in reply to dearest Laura 's No . 1 , to say with what extreme delight she should welcome her sister : how charming it would be to practise their old duets together , to wander o'er the grassy sward , and amidst the yellowing woods of Penshurst and Southborough ! Blanche counted the hours till she should embrace her dearest friend . Laura , No . 2 , expressed her delight at dearest Blanche 's affectionate reply . She hoped that their friendship would never diminish ; that the confidence between them would grow in after years ; that they should have no secrets from each other ; that the aim of the life of each would be to make one person happy . Blanche , No . 2 , followed in two days . "
405601	405608	405566	405567	Mrs. Planter	2091	" Laura , No . 3 . "
405707	405718	405704	405704	She	1138	" - yes , even in italics she would answer - "
405730	405737	405704	405704	She	1138	" Blanche , No . 3 . "
405774	405810	405770	405770	his	739	" Blanche , No . 3 , requires an explanation ; and it can not be better given than in the surprising and mysterious letter of Arthur Pendennis . CHAPTER LXXIII Mr. and Mrs. Sam Huxter "
405814	405818	405811	405812	Dear Blanche	2093	" Arthur wrote , "
406005	406394	405976	405976	he	2094	" Will you be the Vizier 's daughter , and refuse and laugh to scorn Alnaschar , or will you be the Lady of Lyons , and love the penniless Claude Melnotte ? I will act that part if you like . I will love you my best in return . I will do my all to make your humble life happy : for humble it will be : at least the odds are against any other conclusion ; we shall live and die in a poor prosy humdrum way . There will be no stars and epaulettes for the hero of our story . I shall write one or two more stories , which will presently be forgotten . I shall be called to the Bar , and try to get on in my profession : perhaps some day , if I am very lucky , and work very hard which is absurd , I may get a colonial appointment , and you may be an Indian Judge 's lady . Meanwhile . I shall buy back the Pall Mall Gazette ; the publishers are tired of it since the death of poor Shandon , and will sell it for a small sum . Warrington will be my right hand , and write it up to a respectable sale . I will introduce you to Mr. Finucane the sub - editor , and I know who in the end will be Mrs. Finucane , - a very nice gentle creature , who has lived sweetly through a sad life and we will jog on , I say , and look out for better times , and earn our living decently . You shall have the opera - boxes , and superintend the fashionable intelligence , and break your little heart in the poet 's corner . Shall we live over the offices ? - there are four very good rooms , a kitchen , and a garret for Laura , in Catherine Street in the Strand ; or would you like a house in the Waterloo Road ? - it would be very pleasant , only there is that halfpenny toll at the Bridge . The boys may go to King 's College , may n't they ? Does all this read to you like a joke ? "
406743	407031	406725	406725	you	1236	" I can not tell you now - afterwards I might , should the day come when we may have no secrets from one another - what has happened within the last few hours which has changed all my prospects in life : but so it is , that I have learned something which forces me to give up the plans which I had formed , and many vain and ambitious hopes in which I had been indulging . I have written and despatched a letter to Sir Francis Clavering , saying that I can not accept his seat in Parliament until after my marriage ; in like manner I can not and will not accept any larger fortune with you than that which has always belonged to you since your grandfather 's death , and the birth of your half - brother . Your good mother is not in the least aware - I hope she never may be - of the reasons which force me to this very strange decision . They arise from a painful circumstance , which is attributable to none of our faults ; but , having once befallen , they are as fatal and irreparable as that shock which overset honest Alnaschar 's porcelain , and shattered all his hopes beyond the power of mending . I write gaily enough , for there is no use in bewailing such a hopeless mischance . We have not drawn the great prize in the lottery , dear Blanche : but I shall be contented enough without it , if you can be so ; and I repeat , with all my heart , that I will do my best to make you happy . "
407176	407203	407204	407204	You	13269	" To this frank communication came back the letter from Blanche to Laura , and one to Pen himself , which perhaps his own letter justified . "
407211	407215	407216	407216	you	13269	" Blanche wrote ; "
407678	407726	407676	407676	Arthur	739	" I will write more when I am more collected . My racking brain renders thought almost impossible . I long to see Laura ! She will come to us directly we return from the country , will she not ? And you , cold one ! B. "
407945	407961	407963	407963	Pen	799	" Mr. Huxter on particular business ! Pray , beg Mr. Huxter to come in , "
407980	407989	407991	407991	Pen	799	" Pray take a chair , Mr. Huxter , "
407999	408011	407991	407991	Pen	799	" In what way can I be of service to you ? "
408012	408029	407994	407994	his	799	" I had rather not speak before the flunk - before the man , Mr. Pendennis : "
408040	408047	408049	408050	Mr. Huxter	896	" I 'm in a fix , "
408054	408057	408049	408050	Mr. Huxter	896	" Indeed . "
408058	408065	408067	408069	the young surgeon	21727	" She sent me to you , "
408071	408102	408067	408069	the young surgeon	21727	" What , Fanny ? Is she well ? I was coming to see her , but I have had a great deal of business since my return to London . "
408103	408115	408118	408118	Huxter	896	" I heard of you through my governor and Jack Hobnell , "
408120	408146	408147	408147	he	896	" I wish you joy , Mr. Pendennis , both of the borough and the lady , sir . Fanny wishes you joy , too , "
408156	408189	408147	408147	he	896	" There 's many a slip between the cup and the lip ! Who knows what may happen , Mr. Huxter , or who will sit in Parliament for Clavering next session ? "
408190	408199	408201	408202	Mr. Huxter	896	" You can do anything with my governor , "
408204	408247	408201	408202	Mr. Huxter	896	" You got him Clavering Park . The old boy was very much pleased , sir , at your calling him in . Hobnell wrote me so . Do you think you could speak to the governor for me , Mr. Pendennis ? "
408248	408254	408147	408147	he	896	" And tell him what ? "
408255	408265	408267	408267	Huxter	896	" I 've gone and done it , sir , "
408274	408299	408301	408301	Pen	799	" You - you do n't mean to say you have - you have done any wrong to that dear little creature , sir ? "
408310	408315	408317	408317	Huxter	896	" I hope not , "
408324	408418	408317	408317	Huxter	896	" but I 've married her . And I know there will be an awful shindy at home . It was agreed that I should be taken into partnership when I had passed the College , and it was to have been Huxter and Son . But I would have it , confound it . It 's all over now , and the old boy 's wrote me that he 's coming up to town for drugs : he will be here to - morrow , and then it must all come out . "
408419	408427	408429	408429	Pen	799	" And when did this event happen ? "
408466	408486	408487	408487	Huxter	896	" Last Thursday was five weeks - it was two days after Miss Amory came to Shepherd 's Inn , "
408501	408507	408508	408508	Huxter	896	" I was called in , "
408511	408705	408707	408708	Mr. Huxter	896	" I was in the Inn looking after old Cos 's leg ; and about something else too , very likely : and I met Strong , who told me there was a woman taken ill in Chambers , and went up to give her my professional services . It was the old lady who attends Miss Amory - her housekeeper , or some such thing . She was taken with strong hysterics : I found her kicking and screaming like a good one - in Strong 's chamber , along with him and Colonel Altamont , and Miss Amory crying and as pale as a sheet ; and Altamont fuming about - a regular kick - up . They were two hours in the Chambers ; and the old woman went whooping off in a cab . She was much worse than the young one . I called in Grosvenor Place next day to see if I could be of any service , but they were gone without so much as thanking me : and the day after I had business of my own to attend to - a bad business too , "
408712	408732	408707	408708	Mr. Huxter	896	" But it 's done , and ca n't be undone ; and we must make the best of it "
408798	408808	408810	408810	Huxter	896	" Do you know who Altamont is , sir ? "
408826	408873	408875	408875	Huxter	896	" Fanny and I have talked him over , and we ca n't help fancying that it 's Mrs. Lightfoot 's first husband come to life again , and she who has just married a second . Perhaps Lightfoot wo n't be very sorry for it , "
408919	408927	408929	408929	Pen	799	" Let us talk about your affairs , "
408931	408998	408929	408929	Pen	799	" Show me how I can be of any service to you , Huxter . Let me congratulate you on your marriage . I am thankful that Fanny , who is so good , so fascinating , so kind a creature , has found an honest man , and a gentleman who will make her happy . Show me what I can do to help you . "
408999	409007	409009	409009	Huxter	896	" She thinks you can , sir , "
409017	409092	409009	409009	Huxter	896	" and I 'm very much obliged to you , I 'm sure ; and that you might talk over my father , and break the business to him , and my mother , who always has her back up about being a clergyman 's daughter . Fanny ai n't of a good family , I know , and not up to us in breeding and that - but she 's a Huxter now . "
409093	409105	409107	409107	Pen	799	" The wife takes the husband 's rank , of course , "
409109	409118	409120	409120	Huxter	896	" And with a little practice in society , "
409303	409304	409290	409290	she	13298	" "
409313	409319	409305	409305	You	2261	" said Pen , laughing . "
409360	409374	409355	409355	my	0	" said Huxter , putting a very dirty hand up to his chin . "
409378	409597	409355	409355	my	0	" said Mr. Pen , who was infinitely amused , and concerning whom mutato nomine and of course concerning nobody else in the world the fable might have been narrated . As the two gentlemen were in the midst of this colloquy , another knock came to Pen 's door , and his servant presently announced Mr. Bows . The old man followed slowly , his pale face blushing , and his hand trembling somewhat as he took Pen 's . He coughed , and wiped his face in his checked cotton pocket - handkerchief , and sate down with his hands on his knees , the sunshining on his bald head . Pen looked at the homely figure with no small sympathy and kindness . This man , too , has had his griefs and his wounds , Arthur thought . This man , too , has brought his genius and his heart , and laid them at a woman 's feet ; where she spurned them . The chance of life has gone against him , and the prize is with that creature yonder . Fanny 's bridegroom , thus mutely apostrophised , had winked meanwhile with one eye at old Bows , and was driving holes in the floor with the cane which he loved . "
409613	409624	409609	409611	the lucky winner	13316	" Pen said , looking hard at the old man . "
409637	409638	409627	409629	the lucky winner	13316	" "
409648	409679	409641	409641	you	2261	" asked Huxter , who , having winked at Bows with one eye , now favoured Pen with a wink of the other - a wink which seemed to say , "
409699	409700	409715	409716	Mrs. Sam	1810	" "
409741	409742	409726	409726	she	1810	" "
409752	409758	409726	409726	she	1810	" growled the young surgeon . "
409764	409770	409780	409780	she	1810	" said the old man ; "
409834	409860	409827	409827	he	739	" Huxter blushed scarlet , and covered his confusion with an imprecation . Pen laughed ; the scene suited his bitter humour more and more . "
409873	409877	409865	409866	Mr. Huxter	896	" Arthur said , "
409896	409897	409882	409882	I	0	" "
409923	409931	409932	409932	You	2261	" continued Bows , without any pity . "
409999	410000	410001	410001	I	0	" "
410041	410047	410027	410027	I	0	" Arthur said , sadly . "
410124	410125	410116	410116	you	2261	" "
410135	410146	410127	410127	you	0	" said the old fellow , wiping his bald forehead . "
410184	410185	410180	410182	the fortunate youth	20209	" "
410196	410215	410191	410191	you	2261	" Huxter said , who had been much puzzled as the above remarks passed between his two companions . "
410219	410225	410191	410191	you	2261	" said Bows , drily . "
410279	410387	410277	410277	sir	2261	" he said , turning round to Pen with a sneer , ' she had a reason even for giving me that message . I was sitting with her after you left us , very quiet and comfortable ; I was talking away , and she was mending your shirts , when your two young friends , Jack Linton and Bob Blades , looked in from Bartholomew 's ; and then it was she found out that she had this message to send . You need n't hurry yourself , she do n't want you back again ; they 'll stay these two hours , I daresay . "
410413	410427	410428	410428	he	896	" You 'll come and see us , sir , wo n't you ? "
410433	410460	410428	410428	he	896	" You 'll talk over the governor , wo n't you , sir , if I can get out of this place and down to Clavering ? "
410461	410482	410483	410483	Pen	799	" You will promise to attend me gratis if ever I fall ill at Fairoaks , will you , Huxter ? "
410490	410521	410483	410483	Pen	799	" I will do anything I can for you . I will come and see Mrs. Huxter immediately , and we will conspire together about what is to be done . "
410522	410533	410534	410534	Bows	833	" I thought that would send him out , sir , "
410553	410646	410534	410534	Bows	833	" And it 's all true , sir - every word of it . She wants you back again , and sends her husband after you . She cajoles everybody , the little devil . She tries it on you , on me , on poor Costigan , on the young chaps from Bartholomew 's . She 's got a little court of 'em already . And if there 's nobody there , she practises on the old German baker in the shop , or coaxes the black sweeper at the crossing . "
410647	410655	410657	410657	Pen	799	" Is she fond of that fellow ? "
410659	410669	410670	410670	Bows	833	" There is no accounting for likes and dislikes , "
410673	410921	410670	410670	Bows	833	" Yes , she is fond of him ; and having taken the thing into her head , she would not rest until she married him . They had their banns published at St. Clement 's , and nobody heard it or knew any just cause or impediment . And one day she slips out of the porter 's lodge and has the business done , and goes off to Gravesend with Lothario ; and leaves a note for me to go and explain all things to her Ma . Bless you ! the old woman knew it as well as I did , though she pretended ignorance . And so she goes , and I 'm alone again . I miss her , sir , tripping along that court , and coming for her singing lesson ; and I 've no heart to look into the porter 's lodge now , which looks very empty without her , the little flirting thing . And I go and sit and dangle about her lodgings , like an old fool . She makes 'em very trim and nice , though ; gets up all Huxter 's shirts and clothes : cooks his little dinner , and sings at her business like a little lark . What 's the use of being angry ? I lent 'em three pound to go on with : for they have n't got a shilling till the reconciliation , and Pa comes down . "
411067	411073	411074	411074	she	741	" It seems to me , "
411077	411086	411074	411074	she	741	" as if Blanche is acting very artfully . "
411087	411108	411037	411037	Arthur	739	" And wishes so to place matters that she may take me or leave me ? Is it not so ? "
411109	411164	411166	411166	Laura	741	" It is , I am afraid , a kind of duplicity which does not augur well for your future happiness ; and is a bad reply to your own candour and honesty , Arthur . Do you know , I think , I think - I scarcely like to say what I think , "
411193	411213	411216	411216	Laura	741	" It looks to me , Arthur , as if there might be - there might be somebody else , "
411225	411231	411216	411216	Laura	741	" And if there is , "
411236	411255	411216	411216	Laura	741	" and if I am free once again , will the best and dearest of all women - - "
411256	411265	411266	411266	Laura	741	" You are not free , dear brother , "
411270	411347	411266	411266	Laura	741	" You belong to another ; of whom I own it grieves me to think ill . But I ca n't do otherwise . It is very odd that in this letter she does not urge you to tell her the reason why you have broken arrangements which would have been so advantageous to you ; and avoids speaking on the subject . She somehow seems to write as if she knows her father 's secret . "
411351	411359	411348	411348	Pen	799	" Yes , she must know it ; "
411381	411392	411394	411394	Laura	741	" It was not so that she described the meeting , "
411446	411460	411461	411461	Laura	741	" But she was bound to keep her father 's secret , Pen , "
411464	411476	411461	411461	Laura	741	" And yet , and yet - it is very puzzling . "
411576	411599	411573	411573	she	1236	" Tunbridge Wells is not very far off , is it , Arthur ? Had n't you better go and see her ? "
411675	411685	411687	411687	he	739	" Here is the end of hopes and aspirations , "
411689	412178	411687	411687	he	739	" of romance and ambitions ! Where I yield or where I am obstinate , I am alike unfortunate ; my mother implores me , and I refuse an angel ! Say I had taken her ; forced on me as she was , Laura would never have been an angel to me . I could not have given her my heart at another 's instigation ; I never could have known her as she is had I been obliged to ask another to interpret her qualities and point out her virtues . I yield to my uncle 's solicitations , and accept on his guarantee Blanche , and a seat in Parliament , and wealth , and ambition , and a career ; and see ! - fortune comes and leaves me the wife without the dowry , which I had taken in compensation of a heart . Why was I not more honest , or am I not less so ? It would have cost my poor old uncle no pangs to accept Blanche 's fortune whencesoever it came ; he ca n't even understand , he is bitterly indignant , heart - stricken , almost , at the scruples which actuate me in refusing it . I dissatisfy everybody . A maimed , weak , imperfect wretch , it seems as if I am unequal to any fortune . I neither make myself nor any one connected with me happy . What prospect is there for this poor little frivolous girl , who is to take my obscure name and share my fortune ? I have not even ambition to excite me , or self - esteem enough to console myself , much more her , for my failure . If I were to write a book that should go through twenty editions , why , I should be the very first to sneer at my reputation . Say I could succeed at the Bar , and achieve a fortune by bullying witnesses and twisting evidence ; is that a fame which would satisfy my longings , or a calling in which my life would be well spent ? How I wish I could be that priest opposite , who never has lifted his eyes from his breviary , except when we were in Reigate tunnel , when he could not see ; or that old gentleman next him , who scowls at him with eyes of hatred over his newspaper . The priest shuts his eyes to the world , but has his thoughts on the book , which is his directory to the world to come . His neighbour hates him as a monster , tyrant , persecutor , and fancies burning martyrs , and that pale countenance looking on , and lighted up by the flame . These have no doubts ; these march on trustfully , bearing their load of logic . "
412179	412191	412194	412196	the stout gentleman	13361	" Would you like to look at the paper , sir ? "
412241	412259	412260	412260	he	799	" And yet , would you take either of those men 's creeds , with its consequences ? "
412263	412436	412438	412438	Pen	799	" Ah me ! you must bear your own burthen , fashion your own faith , think your own thoughts , and pray your own prayer . To what mortal ear could I tell all , if I had a mind ? or who could understand all ? Who can tell another 's shortcomings , lost opportunities , weigh the passions which overpower , the defects which incapacitate reason ? - what extent of truth and right his neighbour 's mind is organised to perceive and to do ? - what invisible and forgotten accident , terror of youth , chance or mischance of fortune , may have altered the whole current of life ? A grain of sand may alter it , as the flinging of a pebble may end it . Who can weigh circumstances , passions , temptations , that go to our good and evil account , save One , before whose awful wisdom we kneel , and at whose mercy we ask absolution ? Here it ends , "
412440	412497	412438	412438	Pen	799	" this day or to - morrow will wind up the account of my youth ; a weary retrospect , alas ! a sad history , with many a page I would fain not look back on ! But who has not been tired or fallen , and who has escaped without scars from that struggle ? "
412537	412545	412546	412546	he	799	" What matters about fame or poverty ! "
412549	412639	412546	412546	he	799	" If I marry this woman I have chosen , may I have strength and will to be true to her , and to make her happy . If I have children , pray God teach me to speak and to do the truth among them , and to leave them an honest name . There are no splendours for my marriage . Does my life deserve any ? I begin a new phase of it ; a better than the last may it be , I pray Heaven ! "
412783	412910	412937	412938	The man	14896	" Blanche , I can not understand from your last letter what your meaning is , or whether my fair and frank proposal to you is acceptable or no . I think you know the reason which induces me to forgo the worldly advantages which a union with you offered , and which I could not accept without , as I fancy , being dishonoured . If you doubt of my affection , here I am ready to prove it . Let Smirke be called in , and let us be married out of hand ; and with all my heart I purpose to keep my vow , and to cherish you through life , and to be a true and a loving husband to you . "
412967	412977	412978	412979	the man	14896	" Her Ladyship 's not at home , sir , "
412982	412988	412989	412989	Arthur	739	" I am Mr. Pendennis , "
412992	412997	412989	412989	Arthur	739	" Where is Lightfoot ? "
412998	413003	413005	413006	the man	14896	" Lightfoot is gone , "
413008	413020	413005	413006	the man	14896	" My Lady is out , and my orders was - - "
413021	413034	413036	413036	Arthur	739	" I hear Miss Amory 's voice in the drawing - room , "
413038	413052	413060	413060	he	739	" Take the bag to a dressing - room , if you please ; "
413172	413184	413166	413166	Arthur	739	" What , Foker ! how do you do , Foker ? "
413269	413277	413279	413279	Foker	801	" How de - do , Pendennis ? "
413323	413329	413330	413330	she	1236	" How is dearest Laura ? "
413395	413402	413367	413369	Master Frank Clavering	1250	" Here 's a jolly go ! "
413461	413515	413434	413434	Arthur	739	" And this was the secret , was it ? Do n't blush and turn away , Foker , my boy . Why , man , you are a pattern of fidelity . Could I stand between Blanche and such constancy - could I stand between Miss Amory and fifteen thousand a year ? "
413516	413525	413526	413526	Blanche	1236	" It is not that , Mr. Pendennis , "
413533	413582	413526	413526	Blanche	1236	" It is not money , it is not rank , it is not gold that moves me ; but it is constancy , it is fidelity , it is a whole trustful loving heart offered to me , that I treasure - yes , that I treasure ! "
413601	413729	413598	413598	she	1236	" I do not disown , I do not disguise - my life is above disguise - to him on whom it is bestowed , my heart must be for ever bare - that I once thought I loved you , - yes , thought I was beloved by you , I own ! How I clung to that faith ! How I strove , I prayed , I longed to believe it ! But your conduct always - your own words so cold , so heartless , so unkind , have undeceived me . You trifled with the heart of the poor maiden ! You flung me back with scorn the troth which I had plighted ! I have explained all - all to Mr. Foker . "
413730	413735	413737	413737	Foker	801	" That you have , "
413748	413753	413755	413755	Pen	799	" What , all ? "
413764	413910	413755	413755	Pen	799	" It is I am in fault , is it ? Well , well , Blanche , be it so . I wo n't appeal against your sentence , and bear it in silence . I came down here looking to very different things , Heaven knows , and with a heart most truly and kindly disposed towards you . I hope you may be happy with another , as , on my word , it was my wish to make you so ; and I hope my honest old friend here will have a wife worthy of his loyalty , his constancy , and affection . Indeed they deserve the regard of any woman - even Miss Blanche Amory . Shake hands , Harry ; do n't look askance at me . Has anybody told you that I was a false and heartless character ? "
413911	413919	413925	413925	his	801	" I think you 're a - - "
413932	413948	413929	413929	Blanche	1236	" Henry , not a word ! - I pray you let there be forgiveness ! "
413949	413963	413965	413965	Foker	801	" You 're an angel , by Jove , you 're an angel ! "
413977	414002	414003	414004	the seraph	13391	" In spite of what has passed , for the sake of what has passed , I must always regard Arthur as a brother , "
414007	414071	414003	414004	the seraph	13391	" we have known each other years , we have trodden the same fields , and plucked the same flowers together . Arthur ! Henry ! I beseech you to take hands and to be friends ! Forgive you ! - I forgive you , Arthur , with my heart I do . Should I not do so for making me so happy ? "
414072	414087	414088	414088	Arthur	739	" There is only one person of us three whom I pity , Blanche , "
414093	414119	414088	414088	Arthur	739	" and I say to you again , that I hope you will make this good fellow , this honest and loyal creature , happy . "
414120	414126	414128	414128	Harry	801	" Happy ! O Heavens ! "
414143	414281	414282	414282	Blanche	1236	" She do n't know - she ca n't know how fond I am of her , and - and who am I ? a poor little beggar , and she takes me up and says she 'll try and I - I - love me . I ai n't worthy of so much happiness . Give us your hand , old boy , since she forgives you after your heartless conduct , and says she loves you . I 'll make you welcome . I tell you I 'll love everybody who loves her . By - - , if she tells me to kiss the ground I 'll kiss it . Tell me to kiss the ground ! I say , tell me . I love you so . You see I love you so . "
414340	414356	414358	414358	Pen	799	" I swear that is a villain who deceives such a loving creature as that , "
414391	414395	414396	414396	she	1236	" Foolish boy ? "
414399	414417	414396	414396	she	1236	" it shall be loved as it deserves : who could help loving such a silly creature ! "
414431	414437	414438	414438	he	1250	" I say , Pendennis ! "
414441	414446	414438	414438	he	1250	" Well , Frank ! "
414447	414465	414396	414396	she	1236	" The man wants to be paid , and go back . He 's had some beer . "
414466	414474	414476	414476	Pen	799	" I 'll go back with him , "
414478	414504	414476	414476	Pen	799	" Good - bye , Blanche . God bless you , Foker , old friend . You know , neither of you want me here . "
414513	414533	414534	414534	Blanche	1236	" Stay - I must say one word to you . One word in private , if you please , "
414537	414550	414534	414534	Blanche	1236	" You can trust us together , ca n't you , Henry ? "
414570	414574	414576	414576	he	801	" Trust you ! "
414578	414595	414576	414576	he	801	" Oh , who would n't trust you ! Come along , Franky , my boy . "
414596	414603	414605	414605	Frank	1250	" Let 's have a cigar , "
414614	414621	414623	414623	Foker	801	" She do n't like it , "
414627	414643	414645	414647	the candid youth	13395	" Law bless you - she do n't mind . Pendennis used to smoke regular , "
414649	414661	414663	414663	Blanche	1236	" It was but a short word I had to say , "
414676	414685	414663	414663	Blanche	1236	" You never loved me , Mr. Pendennis . "
414686	414693	414695	414695	Arthur	739	" I told you how much , "
414697	414703	414695	414695	Arthur	739	" I never deceived you . "
414704	414715	414717	414717	Blanche	1236	" I suppose you will go back and marry Laura , "
414719	414728	414730	414730	Pen	799	" Was that what you had to say ? "
414732	414760	414730	414730	Pen	799	" You are going to her this very night , I am sure of it . There is no denying it . You never cared for me . "
414761	414765	414695	414695	Arthur	739	" Et vous ? "
414766	414901	414730	414730	Pen	799	" Et moi , c'est different . I have been spoilt early . I can not live out of the world , out of excitement . I could have done so , but it is too late . If I can not have emotions , I must have the world . You would offer me neither one nor the other . You are blase in everything , even in ambition . You had a career before you , and you would not take it . You give it up ! - for what ? - for a betise , for an absurd scruple . Why would you not have that seat , and be such a puritain ? Why should you refuse what is mine by right , by right , entendez - vous ? "
414902	414909	414911	414911	Pen	799	" You know all , then ? "
414913	415049	414911	414911	Pen	799	" Only within a month . But I have suspected ever since Baymouth - n'importe since when . It is not too late . He is as if he had never been ; and there is a position in the world before you yet . Why not sit in Parliament , exert your talent , and give a place in the world to yourself , to your wife ? I take celui - la . Il est bon . Il est riche . Il est - vous le connaissez autant que moi enfin . Think you that I would not prefer un homme qui fera parler de moi ? If the secret appears I am rich a millions . How does it affect me ? It is not my fault . It will never appear . "
415050	415061	414730	414730	Pen	799	" You will tell Harry everything , wo n't you ? "
415062	415069	415071	415071	Blanche	1236	" Je comprends . Vous refusez , "
415075	415221	415071	415071	Blanche	1236	" I will tell Harry at my own time , when we are married . You will not betray me , will you ? You , having a defenceless girl 's secret , will not turn upon her and use it ? S'il me plait de le cacher , mon secret ; pourquoi le donnerai je ? Je l'aime , mon pauvre pere , voyez - vous ? I would rather live with that man than with you fades intriguers of the world . I must have emotions - it m'en donne . Il m'ecrit . Il ecrit tres - bien , voyez - vous - comme un pirate - comme un Bohemien - comme un homme . But for this I would have said to my mother - Ma mere ! quittons ce lache mari , cette lache societe - retournons a mon pere . "
415222	415233	415235	415235	Pen	799	" The pirate would have wearied you like the rest , "
415237	415246	415248	415248	Blanche	1236	" Eh ! Il me faut des emotions , "
415433	415445	415446	415447	The cabman	20036	" Drive as hard as you can go to Jermyn Street . "

415803	415812	415799	415799	he	799	" Come and bless us , dear mother , "
415838	415862	415831	415832	Lady Rockminster	1218	" Upon my word , young people ! Beck ! leave the room . What do you want poking your nose in here ? "
415877	415888	415889	415889	he	1844	" She is consoling me for my misfortune , ma'am , "
415892	415913	415914	415914	Pen	1844	" What do you mean by kissing her hand ? I do n't know what you will be next doing . "
415920	415927	415928	415928	he	1844	" I have been to Tunbridge , "
415931	415954	415955	415955	he	1844	" and seen Miss Amory ; and find on my arrival that - that a villain has transplanted me in her affections , "
415962	415978	415980	415982	the old lady	14000	" Is that all ? Is that what you were whimpering on your knees about ? "
415987	415999	415980	415982	the old lady	14000	" You might have kept the news till to - morrow . "
416000	416008	416011	416011	Pen	1844	" Yes - another has superseded me , "
416013	416040	416011	416011	Pen	1844	" but why call him villain ? He is brave , he is constant , he is young , he is wealthy , he is beautiful . "
416041	416050	416052	416054	the old lady	14000	" What stuff are you talking , sir ? "
416056	416061	416052	416054	the old lady	14000	" What has happened ? "
416062	416170	416011	416011	Pen	1844	" Miss Amory has jilted me , and accepted Henry Foker , Esq . I found her warbling ditties to him as he lay at her feet ; presents had been accepted , vows exchanged , these ten days . Harry was old Mrs. Planter 's rheumatism , which kept dearest Laura out of the house . He is the most constant and generous of men . He has promised the living of Logwood to Lady Ann 's husband , and given her a splendid present on her marriage ; and he rushed to fling himself at Blanche 's feet the instant he found he was free . "
416171	416194	416196	416198	the old lady	14000	" And so , as you ca n't get Blanche , you put up with Laura ; is that it , sir ? "
416200	416205	416206	416206	Laura	741	" He acted nobly , "
416209	416217	416219	416219	Pen	1844	" I acted as she bade me , "
416221	416291	416219	416219	Pen	1844	" Never mind how , Lady Rockminster ; but to the best of my knowledge and power . And if you mean that I am not worthy of Laura , I know it , and pray Heaven to better me ; and if the love and company of the best and purest creature in the world can do so , at least I shall have these to help me . "
416292	416297	416299	416301	the old lady	14000	" Hm , hm , "
416316	416330	416299	416301	the old lady	14000	" It is all very well ; but I should have preferred Bluebeard . "
416446	416520	416442	416442	his	1844	" You see , Laura , I was not so guilty in that little affair ; it was the girl who made love to me , and I who resisted . As I am no longer present , the little siren practises her arts and fascinations upon others . Let that transaction be forgotten in your mind , if you please ; or visit me with a very gentle punishment for my error . "
416532	416545	416546	416546	she	741	" If you did any wrong , you repented , dear Pen , "
416549	416554	416555	416555	she	741	" and you know , "
416564	416574	416555	416555	she	741	" that I have no right to reproach you . "
416575	416578	416580	416582	the old lady	14000	" Hm ! "
416584	416591	416580	416582	the old lady	14000	" I should have preferred Bluebeard . "
416592	416619	416620	416620	Pen	1844	" The past is broken away . The morrow is before us . I will do my best to make your morrow happy , dear Laura , "
416681	416833	416677	416677	she	14022	" How strange it is that I ever should have cared for another ! I am vexed almost to think I care for him so little , am so little sorry that he is gone away . Oh , in these past two months how I have learned to love Arthur ! I care about nothing but Arthur : my waking and sleeping thoughts are about him ; he is never absent from me . And to think that he is to be mine , mine ! and that I am to marry him , and not to be his servant as I expected to be only this morning ; for I would have gone down on my knees to Blanche to beg her to let me live with him . And now - Oh , it is too much . Oh , mother ! mother , that you were here ! "
416890	416901	416902	416902	she	13435	" What a sly demure little wretch you have been , "
416924	416933	416902	416902	she	13435	" and how you have kept your secret ! "
416934	416944	416946	416946	Laura	741	" How are we to help the young couple ? "
416968	416976	416978	416978	Pen	1844	" We must go and see them , "
416980	416990	416992	416992	Laura	741	" Of course we must go and see them , "
416994	417019	416992	416992	Laura	741	" I intend to be very fond of Fanny . Let us go this instant . Lady Rockminster , may I have the carriage ? "
417020	417068	417069	417069	Arthur	739	" Go now ! - why , you stupid creature , it is eleven o'clock at night . Mr. and Mrs. Huxter have got their nightcaps on , I dare say . And it is time for you to go now . Good night , Mr. Pendennis . "
417078	417098	417071	417071	Laura	741	" We will go to - morrow morning , then . I will come and fetch you with Martha . "

417118	417144	417107	417107	Pen	1844	" will have a great effect in Lamb Court and Smithfield . Stay - Lady Rockminster , will you join us in a little conspiracy ? "
417145	417155	417071	417071	Laura	741	" How do you mean conspiracy , young man ? "
417156	417248	417071	417071	Laura	741	" Will you please to be a little ill to - morrow ; and when old Mr. Huxter arrives , will you let me call him in ? If he is put into a good humour at the notion of attending a baronet in the country , what influence wo n't a countess have on him ? When he is softened - when he is quite ripe , we will break the secret upon him ; bring in the young people , extort the paternal benediction , and finish the comedy . "
417249	417255	417257	417259	the old lady	14000	" A parcel of stuff , "
417261	417288	417257	417259	the old lady	14000	" Take your hat , sir . Come away , miss . There - my head is turned another way . Good night , young people . "

417436	417467	417433	417433	she	986	" You were always very kind , Mr. Pendennis . And - and I hope your friend is better , who was took ill in Shepherd 's Inn , ma'am . "

And when we live in the country , I hope we shall see each other . And I shall be always happy to hear of your happiness , Fanny . "
417550	417584	417599	417599	herself	741	" We are going to do what you and Huxter have done , Fanny . - Where is Huxter ? What nice , snug lodgings you 've got ! What a pretty cat ! "
417601	417652	417596	417596	Laura	741	" Well , now really ! is this the creature about whom we were all so frightened ? What could he see in her ? She 's a homely little thing , but such manners ! Well , she was very kind to him , - bless her for that . "
417699	417713	417714	417714	she	986	" If his parent casts him off , what are we to do ? "
417717	417757	417714	417714	she	986	" I shall never pardon myself for bringing ruing on my ' usband 's ' ead . You must intercede for us , Mr. Arthur . If mortal man can , you can bend and influence Mr. Huxter senior . "
418003	418049	418050	418050	Pen	1844	" The governor had arrived ; was at the Somerset Coffee - house - was in tolerable good - humour - something about the railway : but he had been afraid to speak about - about that business . Would Mr. Pendennis try it on ? "
418128	418141	418143	418144	Mr. Huxter	896	" And I can afford to give myself a lark , sir , "
418151	418203	418143	418144	Mr. Huxter	896	" Of course you know the news ? we have got our bill , sir . We shall have our branch line - our shares are up , sir - and we buy your three fields along the Brawl , and put a pretty penny into your pocket , Mr. Pendennis . "
418204	418213	418214	418214	Pen	1844	" Indeed ! - that was good news . "
418246	418262	418264	418264	Pen	1844	" I hope you do n't intend to grow rich , and give up practice , "
418266	418320	418264	418264	Pen	1844	" We ca n't lose you at Clavering , Mr. Huxter ; though I hear very good accounts of your son . My friend , Dr. Goodenough speaks most highly of his talents . It is hard that a man of your eminence , though , should be kept in a country town . "
418321	418334	418336	418337	Mr. Huxter	896	" The metropolis would have been my sphere of action , sir , "
418343	418364	418336	418337	Mr. Huxter	896	" But a man takes his business where he finds it ; and I succeeded to that of my father . "
418365	418374	418376	418376	Pen	1844	" It was my father 's , too , "
418378	418387	418376	418376	Pen	1844	" I sometimes wish I had followed it . "
418388	418400	418402	418404	the old gentleman	15207	" You , sir , have taken a more lofty career , "
418406	418523	418402	418404	the old gentleman	15207	" You aspire to the senate : and to literary honours . You wield the poet 's pen , sir , and move in the circles of fashion . We keep an eye upon you at Clavering . We read your name in the lists of the select parties of the nobility . Why , it was only the other day that my wife was remarking how odd it was that at a party at the Earl of Kidderminster 's your name was not mentioned . To what member of the aristocracy may I ask does that equipage belong from which I saw you descend ? The Countess Dowager of Rockminster ? How is her Ladyship ? "
418524	418554	418555	418555	Pen	1844	" Her Ladyship is not very well ; and when I heard that you were coming to town , I strongly urged her to see you , Mr. Huxter , "
418579	418606	418608	418608	Pen	1844	" There is an old friend of yours in the carriage - a Clavering lady , too - will you come out and speak to her ? "
418928	419087	418911	418913	Menth : Pip	2111	" Miss Bell seemed to be on the most confidential and affectionate footing with her Ladyship . She was about to form a matrimonial connexion . All young people ought to marry . Such were her Ladyship 's words ; and the Countess condescended to ask respecting my own family , and I mentioned you by name to her Ladyship , Sam , my boy . I shall look in to - morrow , when , if the remedies which I have prescribed for her Ladyship have had the effect which I anticipate , I shall probably follow them up by a little Spir : Lavend : Comp : - and so set my noble patient up . What is the theatre which is most frequented by the - by the higher classes in town , hey , Sam ! and to what amusement will you take an old country doctor to - night , hey , sir ? "
419230	419244	419246	419246	Arthur	739	" He ought to practise in the country whatever you do , sir , "
419248	419265	419246	419246	Arthur	739	" he ought to marry - other people are going to do so - and settle . "
419266	419290	419246	419246	Arthur	739	" The very words that her Ladyship used yesterday , Mr. Pendennis . He ought to marry . Sam should marry , sir . "
419291	419301	419303	419303	Pen	1844	" The town is full of temptations , sir , "

419347	419359	419310	419311	that houri	13495	" And love is better than money , is n't it ? "
419360	419365	419367	419368	Miss Bell	741	" Indeed it is , "
419370	419379	419381	419383	the old gentleman	15207	" I agree with so fair an authority , "
419389	419397	419398	419398	Pen	1844	" And - and suppose , sir , "
419401	419414	419398	419398	Pen	1844	" that I had a piece of news to communicate to you . "
419415	419429	419431	419433	the old gentleman	15207	" God bless my soul , Mr. Pendennis ! what do you mean ? "
419435	419555	419398	419398	Pen	1844	" Suppose I had to tell you that a young man , carried away by an irresistible passion for an admirable and most virtuous young creature - whom everybody falls in love with - had consulted the dictates of reason and his heart , and had married . Suppose I were to tell you that that man is my friend ; that our excellent , our truly noble friend the Countess Dowager of Rockminster is truly interested about him and you may fancy what a young man can do in life when THAT family is interested for him ; suppose I were to tell you that you know him - that he is here - that he is - - "
419556	419573	419626	419628	the old gentleman	15207	" Sam married ! God bless my soul , sir , you do n't mean that ! "
419574	419586	419398	419398	Pen	1844	" And to such a nice creature , dear Mr. Huxter . "
419587	419595	419597	419597	Pen	1844	" Her Ladyship is charmed with her , "
419615	419624	419626	419628	the old gentleman	15207	" Married ! the rascal , is he ? "
419630	419638	419640	419640	Pen	1844	" They will do it , sir , "
419695	419705	419707	419707	Sam	1810	" Will never do so any more , sir , "
419709	419715	419717	419718	Mr. Huxter	896	" Get up , sir , "
419766	419775	419776	419776	he	896	" What 's your name , my dear ? "
419786	419791	419793	419794	Mrs. Samuel	1810	" Fanny , papa , "
419917	419926	419927	419928	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" This ancient and well - established house , "
419933	420040	419927	419928	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" has been repaired and decorated in a style of the greatest comfort . Gentlemen hunting with the Dumplingbeare hounds will find excellent stabling and loose - boxes for horses at the Clavering Arms . A commodious billiard - room has been attached to the hotel , and the cellars have been furnished with the choicest wines and spirits , selected , without regard to expense , by C. L. Commercial gentlemen will find the Clavering Arms a most comfortable place of resort : and the scale of charges has been regulated for all , so as to meet the economical spirit of the present times . "
420304	420356	420358	420360	the Chatteris Champion	1009	" An interesting event , which is likely to take place in the life of our talented townsman , Arthur Pendennis , Esq . , has , we understand , caused him to relinquish the intentions which he had of offering himself as a candidate for our borough : and rumour whispers "
420409	420526	420406	420407	B. F.	2118	" that should Sir Francis Clavering 's failing health oblige him to relinquish his seat in Parliament , he will vacate it in favour of a young gentleman of colossal fortune and related to the highest aristocracy of the empire , who is about to contract a matrimonial alliance with an accomplished and lovely lady , connected by the nearest ties with the respected family at Clavering Park . Lady Clavering and Miss Amory have arrived at the Park for the Christmas holidays ; and we understand that a large number of the aristocracy are expected , and that festivities of a peculiarly interesting nature will take place there at the commencement of the new year . "
420678	420855	420862	420864	the old lady	14000	" Mr. Pendennis 's income is so much ; the railroad will give him so much more , he states ; Miss Bell has so much , and may probably have a little more one day . For persons in their degree , they will be able to manage very well . And I shall speak to my nephew Pynsent , who I suspect was once rather attached to her , - but of course that was out of the question ' Oh ! of course , my lady ; I should think so indeed ! ' - not that you know anything whatever about it , or have any business to think at all on the subject , - I shall speak to George Pynsent , who is now chief secretary of the Tape and Sealing Wax Office , and have Mr. Pendennis made something . And , Beck , in the morning you will carry down my compliments to Major Pendennis , and say that I shall pay him a visit at one o'clock . "
420857	420860	420862	420864	the old lady	14000	" Yes , "
420866	420884	420862	420864	the old lady	14000	" the Major must be reconciled , and he must leave his fortune to Laura 's children . "
421024	421028	421029	421029	he	14242	" Dear uncle , "
421032	421109	421029	421029	he	14242	" if there has been any question between us , it is over now . I went to Tunbridge Wells yesterday , and found that somebody else had carried off the prize about which we were hesitating . Miss A. , without any compunction for me , has bestowed herself upon Harry Foker , with his fifteen thousand a year . I came in suddenly upon their loves , and found and left him in possession . "
421163	421164	421165	421165	I	0	" "
421179	421196	421172	421172	you	13557	" the Major said , with a most courtly smile and bow to Pen 's ambassadress . "
421237	421238	421228	421228	you	13557	" "
421248	421256	421257	421257	He	14347	" said Lady Rockminster , most politely . "
421281	421287	421257	421257	He	14347	" continued the old gentleman ; "
421344	421345	421346	421346	We	13564	" "
421354	421359	421360	421360	we	13564	" continued the lady ; "
421367	422099	421364	421365	a wife	3520	" The truth then came across the Major 's mind , and he saw for what purpose Lady Rockminster had chosen to assume the office of ambassadress . It is not necessary to enter into the conversation which ensued , or to tell at any length how her Ladyship concluded a negotiation which , in truth , was tolerably easy . There could be no reason why Pen should not marry according to his own and his mother 's wish ; and as for Lady Rockminster , she supported the marriage by intimations which had very great weight with the Major , but of which we shall say nothing , as her ladyship now , of course , much advanced in years is still alive , and the family might be angry ; and , in fine , the old gentleman was quite overcome by the determined graciousness of the lady , and her fondness for Laura . Nothing , indeed , could be more bland and kind than Lady Rockminster 's whole demeanour , except for one moment when the Major talked about his boy throwing himself away , at which her ladyship broke out into a little speech , in which she made the Major understand , what poor Pen and his friends acknowledge very humbly , that Laura was a thousand times too good for him . Laura was fit to be the wife of a king , - Laura was a paragon of virtue and excellence . And it must be said , that when Major Pendennis found that a lady of the rank of the Countess of Rockminster seriously admired Miss Bell , he instantly began to admire her himself . So that when Herr Frosch was requested to walk upstairs to Lady Rockminster 's apartments , and inform Miss Bell and Mr. Arthur Pendennis that the Major would receive them , and Laura appeared blushing and happy as she hung on Pen 's arm , the Major gave a shaky hand to one and the other , with unaffected emotion and cordiality , and then went through another salutation to Laura , which caused her to blush still more . Happy blushes ! bright eyes beaming with the light of love ! The story - teller turns from this group to his young audience , and hopes that one day their eyes may all shine so . Pen having retreated in the most friendly manner , and the lovely Blanche having bestowed her young affections upon a blushing bridegroom with fifteen thousand a year , there was such an outbreak of happiness in Lady Clavering 's heart and family as the good Begum had not known for many a year , and she and Blanche were on the most delightful terms of cordiality and affection . The ardent Foker pressed onwards the happy day , and was as anxious as might be expected to abridge the period of mourning which had put him in possession of so many charms and amiable qualities , of which he had been only , as it were , the heir - apparent , not the actual owner , until then . The gentle Blanche , everything that her affianced lord could desire , was not averse to gratify the wishes of her fond Henry . Lady Clavering came up from Tunbridge . Milliners and jewellers were set to work and engaged to prepare the delightful paraphernalia of Hymen . Lady Clavering was in such a good humour , that Sir Francis even benefited by it , and such a reconciliation was effected between this pair , that Sir Francis came to London , sate at the head of his own table once more , and appeared tolerably flush of money at his billiard - rooms and gambling - houses again . One day , when Major Pendennis and Arthur went to dine in Grosvenor Place , they found an old acquaintance established in the quality of major - domo , and the gentleman in black , who , with perfect politeness and gravity , offered them their choice of sweet or dry champagne , was no other than Mr. James Morgan . The Chevalier Strong was one of the party ; he was in high spirits and condition , and entertained the company with accounts of his amusements abroad . "
422108	422118	422102	422103	my Lady	5047	" said Strong to Arthur , under his voice - "
422157	422189	422150	422151	Major Pendennis	693	" Mr. Morgan helped Major Pendennis to his great - coat when he was quitting the house ; and muttered something about having accepted a temporary engagement with the Clavering family . "
422201	422207	422198	422199	Mr. Morgan	820	" said the old gentleman . "
422227	422236	422209	422209	you	13568	" said Mr. Morgan , with downcast eyes . "
422261	422359	422258	422258	I	0	" Arthur overheard the sentence , and saw the look of hatred which accompanied it , suddenly cried out that he had forgotten his handkerchief , and ran upstairs to the drawing - room again . Foker was still there ; still lingering about his siren . Pen gave the siren a look full of meaning , and we suppose that the siren understood meaning looks , for when , after finding the veracious handkerchief of which he came in quest , he once more went out , the siren , with a laughing voice , said , "
422376	422385	422367	422367	I	0	" and she came out to the door . "
422390	422398	422367	422367	I	0	" she asked , shutting the door . "
422413	422414	422408	422409	villain Morgan	820	" "
422419	422423	422415	422415	I	0	" she said . "
422429	422430	422425	422425	you	739	" "
422435	422439	422425	422425	you	739	" she said . "
422446	422447	422440	422440	You	739	" "
422451	422455	422448	422448	Morgan	820	" said Pen . "
422462	422466	422458	422458	he	820	" said Blanche . "
422494	422517	422518	422518	I	0	" said the girl , who had been all smiles , and grace , and gaiety during the evening . Arthur said , "
422550	422551	422545	422545	him	801	" "
422612	422671	422600	422600	I	0	" and she went in , singing and kissing her little hand , as Morgan the velvet - footed came up the carpeted stair . Pen heard Blanche 's piano breaking out into brilliant music as he went down to join his uncle ; and they walked away together . Arthur briefly told him what he had done . "
422678	422682	422600	422600	I	0	" he asked . "
422691	422697	422600	422600	I	0	" said the old gentleman . "
422716	422726	422709	422709	Begad	2082	" said the old fellow , with a shudder , "
422743	422744	422745	422745	I	0	" "
422754	422758	422749	422749	she	13575	" said Pen . "
422768	422774	422761	422761	she	13575	" said the old man . "
422847	422924	422845	422845	Arthur	739	" Strong began once or twice , as if to converse upon the subject , but the Major would not hear a word . He remarked on the moonlight on Apsley House , the weather , the cabstands - anything but that subject . He bowed stiffly to Strong , and clung to his nephew 's arm , as he turned down St. James 's Street , and again cautioned Pen to leave the affair alone . "
422944	422976	422935	422935	sir	2261	" he said . When Arthur came out of the hotel , Strong 's cloak and cigar were visible a few doors off . The jolly Chevalier laughed as they met . "
422985	422989	422977	422977	I	0	" he said . "
423091	423092	423093	423093	I	0	" "
423100	423104	423105	423105	I	0	" said Pen . "
423147	423148	423151	423151	he	13584	" "
423158	423163	423151	423151	he	13584	" said the Chevalier . "
423264	423265	423261	423262	the villain	3714	" "
423270	423274	423268	423268	Amory	1236	" asked Pen . "
423347	423348	423332	423332	I	0	" "
423359	423363	423356	423356	I	0	" said Pen . "
423485	423486	423489	423489	he	15961	" "
423494	423498	423489	423489	he	15961	" said Pen . "
423586	423593	423575	423575	I	0	" said Strong with a blush , "
423774	423834	423768	423769	Ned Strong	1225	" And the Chevalier pulled out a handsome card , stating that Strong and Company , Shepherd 's Inn , were sole agents of the celebrated Diamond Manzanilla of the Duke of Garbanzos , Grandee of Spain of the First Class ; and of the famous Toboso hams , fed on acorns only in the country of Don Quixote . "
423870	423879	423880	423880	I	0	" Pen laughed as he took the card . "
423896	423900	423901	423901	You	2261	" he said . "
423909	423910	423903	423903	I	0	" "
423924	423925	423919	423919	You	2261	" "
423937	423942	423926	423926	I	0	" said the other . "
423967	423974	423977	423977	she	2600	" Pen added after a pause . "
424050	424060	424042	424042	he	1314	" Here the Chevalier burst out in a laugh . "
424154	424297	424141	424141	her	13615	" And now we have brought up our narrative to the point , whither the announcement in the Chatteris Champion had already conducted us . It wanted but very , very few days before that blissful one when Foker should call Blanche his own ; the Clavering folks had all pressed to see the most splendid new carriage in the whole world , which was standing in the coach - house at the Clavering Arms ; and shown , in grateful return for drink , commonly , by Mr. Foker 's head - coachman . Madame Fribsby was occupied in making some lovely dresses for the tenants ' daughters , who were to figure as a sort of bridesmaids ' chorus at the breakfast and marriage ceremony . And immense festivities were to take place at the Park upon this delightful occasion . "
424482	424826	424475	424475	I	0	" So spoke Harry Foker in the bar of the Clavering Arms . He had apartments at that hotel , and had gathered a circle of friends round him there . He treated all to drink who came . He was hail - fellow with every man . He was so happy ! He danced round Madame Fribsby , Mrs. Lightfoot 's great ally , as she sate pensive in the bar . He consoled Mrs. Lightfoot , who had already begun to have causes of matrimonial disquiet ; for the truth must be told , that young Lightfoot , having now the full command of the cellar , had none over his own unbridled desires , and was tippling and tipsy from morning till night . And a piteous sight it was for his fond wife to behold the big youth reeling about the yard and coffee - room , or drinking with the farmers and tradesmen his own neat wines and carefully selected stock of spirits . When he could find time , Mr. Morgan the butler came from the Park , and took a glass at the expense of the landlord of the Clavering Arms . He watched poor Lightfoot 's tipsy vagaries with savage sneers . Mrs. Lightfoot felt always doubly uncomfortable when her unhappy spouse was under his comrade 's eye . But a few months married , and to think he had got to this ! Madame Fribsby could feel for her . Madame Fribsby could tell her stories of men every bit as bad . She had had her own woes too , and her sad experience of men . So it is that nobody seems happy altogether ; and that there 's bitters , as Mr. Foker remarked , in the cup of every man 's life . And yet there did not seem to be any in his , the honest young fellow ! It was brimming over with happiness and good - humour . Mr. Morgan was constant in his attentions to Foker . "
424836	424846	424847	424847	He	0	" said the candid young man to Mrs. Lightfoot . "
424878	424897	424871	424875	pa - in - law	13631	" ahem ! never mind , but ma - in - law 's a trump , Mrs. Lightfoot . "
424898	424904	424906	424907	Mrs. Lightfoot	2097	" Indeed my Lady was , "
424929	424949	424951	424952	Mr. Foker	801	" No , I do not like thee , Dr. Fell ; the reason why I can not tell , "
424954	424981	424951	424952	Mr. Foker	801	" and he wants to be taken as my head man . Blanche wants me to take him . Why does Miss Amory like him so ? "
424982	424990	424996	424997	Mrs. Lightfoot	2097	" Did Miss Blanche like him so ? "
425226	425232	425216	425218	The poor woman	25208	" Well , take it . "
425286	425293	425295	425296	little Harry	801	" Hands off , man alive ! "
425301	425349	425295	425296	little Harry	801	" Do n't lay hands on a woman , sir . The man that lays his hand upon a woman , save in the way of kindness , is a - hallo ! it 's a letter for Miss Amory . What 's this , Mrs. Lightfoot ? "
425364	425427	425350	425351	Mrs. Lightfoot	2097	" You unmanly ! to treat a woman so who took you off the street . Oh , you coward , to lay your hand upon your wife ! Why did I marry you ? Why did I leave my Lady for you ? Why did I spend eight hundred pound in fitting up this house that you might drink and guzzle ? "
425428	425443	425445	425446	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" She gets letters , and she wo n't tell me who writes letters , "
425453	425469	425445	425446	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" it 's a family affair , sir . Will you take anything , sir ? "
425470	425488	425490	425490	Foker	801	" I will take this letter to Miss Amory , as I am going to the Park , "
425518	425549	425551	425552	the husband	19222	" He 's comin ' - dammy , who 's a - comin ' ? Who 's J. A. , Mrs. Lightfoot - curse me , who 's J. A. ? "
425559	425569	425554	425555	Mrs. Lightfoot	2097	" Be quiet , you tipsy brute , do , "
425641	425657	425636	425636	He	801	" Who was that who had just come in ? Mrs. Bonner , was it ? "
425704	425710	425712	425713	the Begum	7688	" Good morning , Harry , "
425715	425780	425712	425713	the Begum	7688	" Here 's letters , lots of letters ; Lady Rockminster will be here on Tuesday instead of Monday , and Arthur and the Major come to - day ; and Laura is to go to Dr. Portman 's , and come to church from there : and - what 's the matter , my dear ? What makes you so pale , Harry ? "
425781	425786	425788	425788	Harry	801	" Where is Blanche ! "
425795	425800	425788	425788	Harry	801	" not down yet ? "
425801	425808	425810	425811	the boy	13873	" Blanche is always the last , "
425841	425842	425832	425832	she	13657	" "
425848	425894	425846	425846	Frank	693	" said the mother . Blanche came down presently , looking pale , and with rather an eager look towards Foker ; then she advanced and kissed her mother , and had a face beaming with her very best smiles on when she greeted Harry . "
425902	425913	425900	425900	sir	2261	" she said , and put out both her hands . "
425918	425922	425923	425923	I	0	" answered Harry . "
425935	425936	425933	425933	Blanche	1236	" "
425950	425954	425948	425948	Voyons	2126	" she said . "
425966	425970	425960	425960	I	0	" said Foker . "
425980	425984	425973	425973	I	0	" asked Blanche . "
425992	426002	425986	425987	Mrs. Bonner	1275	" he said , with a shaking voice ; - "
426017	426083	426014	426015	Lady Clavering	693	" Lady Clavering , wondering , took the letter from poor Foker 's shaking hand , and looked at the superscription . As she looked at it , she too began to shake in every limb , and with a scared face she dropped the letter , and running up to Frank , clutched the boy to her , and burst out with a sob - "
426096	426097	426014	426015	Lady Clavering	693	" "
426103	426113	426014	426015	Lady Clavering	693	" cried Blanche , with rather a ghastly smile ; "
426129	426130	426121	426123	a poor pensioner	13660	" "
426141	426146	426121	426123	a poor pensioner	13660	" screamed Lady Clavering . "
426157	426184	426150	426150	Frank	693	" Blanche had taken up the letter , and was moving with it towards the fire , but Foker ran to her and clutched her arm - "
426191	426195	426150	426150	Frank	693	" he said ; "
426206	426207	426208	426208	You	693	" "
426221	426226	426210	426210	you	693	" cried the Baronet ; "
426235	426236	426210	426210	you	693	" "
426245	426254	426243	426243	her	1236	" Blanche cried , pointing to her mother ; "
426272	426282	426269	426270	cruel man	13664	" And Foker opened and read the letter : - "
426451	426452	426456	426457	Lady Clavering	693	" "
426470	426500	426456	426457	Lady Clavering	693	" said poor Foker ; and the distracted woman , having cast her eyes over it , again broke out into hysterical screams , and convulsively grasped her son . "
426512	426516	426501	426501	They	13674	" she said . "
426555	426556	426551	426551	I	0	" "
426564	426575	426560	426560	you	1065	" said Foker , going up and kissing her hand . "
426581	426611	426579	426579	Harry	801	" cried out Blanche , in an ecstasy . But he withdrew his hand , which was upon her side , and turned from her with a quivering lip . "
426616	426620	426579	426579	Harry	801	" he says . "
426633	426642	426631	426631	Harry	801	" Again Miss Amory is in an attitude . "
426652	426656	426657	426657	I	0	" said Foker . "
426734	426745	426723	426723	you	1065	" broke out the young man , with a cry . "
426762	426780	426750	426750	Blanche	1236	" and he covered his face with his hands , and sobbed behind them . Blanche thought , "
426794	426795	426790	426790	Arthur	739	" "
426803	426809	426801	426801	Harry	801	" cried out Lady Clavering . "
426835	426858	426830	426831	This boy	21316	" - Master Frank , who had been looking as scared at the strange scene , here burst into a loud cry . "
426921	426929	426911	426911	Clavering	1250	" Clavering started up at this proposal . "
426943	426947	426937	426937	You	1250	" he said . "
427000	427001	426983	426984	the fellow	15961	" "
427005	427014	426983	426984	the fellow	15961	" said Foker . Blanche gave a scream . "
427017	427026	426983	426984	the fellow	15961	" screamed out the Baronet in his turn , "
427160	427161	427153	427153	I	0	" "
427179	427186	427174	427174	Clavering	693	" said the wife of Amory . "
427222	427245	427220	427220	you	0	" Blanche , eploree , went up to her mother ; but Lady Clavering shrank from her with a sort of terror . "
427251	427255	427220	427220	you	0	" she said ; "
427394	427455	427390	427390	we	13706	" All this while a strange feeling of exultation had taken possession of Blanche 's mind . That month with poor Harry had been a weary month to her . All his fortune and splendour scarcely sufficed to make the idea of himself supportable . She was wearied of his simple ways , and sick of coaxing and cajoling him . "
427464	427481	427462	427462	madam	14296	" she cried out , with a gesture which was always appropriate , though rather theatrical ; "
427587	427605	427606	427606	You	13718	" And the little lady swept round her hand , and thought that she was a heroine . "
427612	427624	427610	427610	you	13718	" cried out Clavering , with one of his usual oaths . "
427653	427872	427650	427650	him	13716	" A chaise was indeed coming up the avenue ; and the two women shrieked each their loudest , expecting at that moment to see Altamont arrive . The door opened , and Mr. Morgan announced Major Pendennis and Mr. Pendennis , who entered , and found all parties engaged in this fierce quarrel . A large screen fenced the breakfast - room from the hall ; and it is probable that , according to his custom , Mr. Morgan had taken advantage of the screen to make himself acquainted with all that occurred . It had been arranged on the previous day that the young people should ride ; and at the appointed hour in the afternoon , Mr. Foker 's horses arrived from the Clavering Arms . But Miss Blanche did not accompany him on this occasion . Pen came out and shook hands with him on the door - steps ; and Harry Foker rode away , followed by his groom in mourning . The whole transactions which have occupied the most active part of our history were debated by the parties concerned during those two or three hours . Many counsels had been given , stories told , and compromises suggested ; and at the end , Harry Foker rode away , with a sad "
427877	427913	427875	427875	you	13720	" from Pen . There was a dreary dinner at Clavering Park , at which the lately installed butler did not attend ; and the ladies were both absent . After dinner , Pen said , "
427927	428004	427914	427914	I	0	" And he walked through the dark avenue , across the bridge and road by his own cottage , - the once quiet and familiar fields of which were flaming with the kilns and forges of the artificers employed on the new railroad works ; and so he entered the town , and made for the Clavering Arms . It was past midnight when he returned to Clavering Park . He was exceedingly pale and agitated . "
428011	428047	428006	428007	Lady Clavering	13722	" he asked . Yes , she was in her own sitting - room . He went up to her , and there found the poor lady in a piteous state of tears and agitation . "
428055	428075	428050	428050	I	0	" he said , looking in ; and entering , he took her hand very affectionately and kissed it . "
428090	428094	428086	428088	dear Lady Clavering	693	" he said . "
428109	428110	428101	428101	I	0	" "
428119	428127	428101	428101	I	0	" she said , pressing his hand . "
428162	428163	428151	428151	You	739	" "
428169	428184	428164	428167	Dear good Lady Clavering	693	" Arthur repeated , with particular emphasis , ' something very strange has happened . "
428185	428192	428194	428195	Lady Clavering	693	" Has anything happened to him ? "
428197	428214	428194	428195	Lady Clavering	693	" Oh , it 's horrid to think I should be glad of it - horrid ! "
428215	428248	428164	428167	Dear good Lady Clavering	693	" He is well . He has been and is gone , my dear lady . Do n't alarm yourself ; - he is gone , and you are Lady Clavering still . "
428249	428261	428262	428262	she	693	" Is it true ? what he sometimes said to me , "
428267	428272	428262	428262	she	693	" that he - - "
428273	428282	428284	428284	Pen	1844	" He was married before he married you , "
428286	428301	428284	428284	Pen	1844	" He has confessed it to - night . He will never come back . "
428795	428802	428781	428781	she	2097	" He knows you . Go . "
428889	428914	428885	428886	the guest	13751	" Come up . I 've got a brace of pistols up there to blow out the brains of any traitor or skulking spy , "

429154	429216	429217	429218	The stranger	14776	" This is not Amory . This is Johnny Armstrong , my wicked - wicked husband , married to me in St. Martin 's Church , mate on board an Indiaman , and he left me two months after , the wicked wretch . This is John Armstrong - here 's the mark on his arm which he made for me . "
429221	429266	429217	429218	The stranger	14776	" I am John Armstrong , sure enough , Polly . I 'm John Armstrong , Amory , Altamont - and let 'em all come on , and try what they can do against a British sailor . Hurray , who 's for it ? "

429313	429327	429329	429330	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" Did he say he 'd take away the Clavering Arms from us ? "
429335	429344	429329	429330	Mr. Lightfoot	1948	" Hang him , I 'll throttle him . "

429683	429820	429826	429827	the commendatore	13772	" But I have to speak to you of other than my own concerns . Yesterday afternoon , a certain J. A. arrived at my chambers from Clavering , which he had left under circumstances of which you are doubtless now aware . In spite of our difference , I could not but give him food and shelter and he partook freely both of the Garbanzos Amontillado and the Toboso ham , and he told me what had happened to him , and many other surprising adventures . The rascal married at sixteen , and has repeatedly since performed that ceremony - in Sydney , in New Zealand , in South America , in Newcastle , he says , first , before he knew our poor friend the milliner . He is a perfect Don Juan . "

Morgan and friend . "

' I wish that scoundrel Morgan had been on the bridge when the General tried his ' sthratagem . ' "

430337	430470	430333	430333	Warrington	1359	" I must not let the day pass over without saying a God bless you , to both of you . May Heaven make you happy , dear Arthur , and dear Laura . I think , Pen , that you have the best wife in the world ; and pray that , as such , you will cherish her and tend her . The chambers will be lonely without you , dear Pen ; but if I am tired , I shall have a new home to go to in the house of my brother and sister . I am practising in the nursery here , in order to prepare for the part of Uncle George . Farewell ! make your wedding tour , and come back to your affectionate G. W. "
